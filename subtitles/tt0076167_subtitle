1
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,813
Hi, Jeevan.

2
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,451
When did you come from Bombay?
- Just today. Father too has come.

3
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,290
Is it?
- To finalise the marriage date.

4
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,464
Brother Ravi!

5
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,641
How amazing! Two hours ago,
I got a call from your dad...

6
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,314
that you've arrived here
from Bombay.

7
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,212
I came here to tell Mala about it
but you've already arrived here.

8
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:46,649
Have you forgotten? You had sent it
from London on my last birthday.

9
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,390
Look, it even bears my name.

10
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,496
Before I go and
meet your father...

11
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,327
tell me, what brings you
here all of a sudden?

12
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:03,237
I want Jeevan and Mala to be married
before the 15th next month.

13
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,173
But Uncle... so soon?
- You see...

14
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,906
I know that your dad passed away
just six months ago.

15
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,116
But dear, life and death are...

16
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,917
Look at this. Your dad had written
this letter to me from Africa.

17
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,367
'My dear friend Karamchand,
I agree to the marriage date'

18
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,868
'My son Rajesh is leaving London
for Delhi today'

19
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:37,801
'He'll start preparations for Mala's
marriage the moment he reaches Delhi'

20
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:44,041
'God willing, the marriage will be
held with a lot of fanfare'

21
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,290
Hi Sunita!
Yes, tell me!

22
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,292
Nice that your father got to know
that my wealth has been depleted.

23
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,406
What're you saying?

24
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,970
And what did you reply?

25
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,576
No, I cannot come to London.

26
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,073
I'm very anxious about
Mala's marriage.

27
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,412
Why're you weeping, Sunita?

28
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,268
Rajesh, dear?

29
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,340
Come, Ramu Uncle.
Be seated.

30
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:49,010
Did you meet Seth Karamchand?
- Yes.

31
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,614
He wants Jeevan and Mala to be
married by 15th of next month.

32
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,448
By 15th? But how will you get
money for her marriage so soon?

33
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:04,289
I don't understand. Within no time,
my family has been devastated.

34
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:10,625
This is the last letter which dad
sent to me from Africa.

35
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,471
'Dear Rajesh, ever since the
government has changed here... '

36
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,803
'the conditions here aren't
favourable for Indian businessmen'

37
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,469
'So I've sold off all my
factory and all properties'

38
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,812
'ln exchange, I've been paid
in diamonds worth 250 million'

39
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,146
'After paying off the taxes, and with
the government's permission... '

40
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,656
'I'm bringing these diamonds with me
to India concealed in a leather belt'

41
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,321
And then?

42
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,392
His plane had halted
at Beirut enroute.

43
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:47,398
He suffered a heart attack
there and he passed away.

44
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,038
What about the leather belt
which contained the diamonds?

45
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,175
I don't know where it vanished.

46
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,412
My dad's lifelong earnings...

47
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,846
I've to go to the hall
to sing songs.

48
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,555
O God! You've changed
fortunes so drastically.

49
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,529
A millionaire's son
is making his living...

50
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,860
by singing in hotels today.

51
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,030
It's all a matter of luck.

52
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,089
Is your name Rajesh, dear?
- Yes.

53
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,590
I want to speak something urgent.

54
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,435
Come in.

55
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,102
Be seated.

56
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,608
Tell me, what is it?

57
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,285
I want to ask you something.

58
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,516
Have you got the diamonds which
your dad sent from Africa?

59
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,127
I'm sure you mustn't
have got those diamonds.

60
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,294
Else, you wouldn't have worked
in this hotel as a singer.

61
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,131
Am I right?

62
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:38,534
My name is Saudagar Singh, and he's
my friend Baljeet Kumar Dana.

63
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:44,308
I'm a businessman. I was coming from
Africa some six months ago.

64
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,147
Your father suffered such a heart
attack at Beirut airport...

65
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,979
that he had no hopes of surviving.

66
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:57,921
In my presence, he gave a leather
belt containing diamonds to a man...

67
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,492
He gave him your name and address
to him and asked him...

68
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,998
to deliver that belt to you.
- Do you know that man?

69
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,671
Yes. I know him very well.
- Where's he?

70
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,362
Right here. In Delhi.

71
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:13,876
He's rich and respectable, but
in reality he's a dangerous smuggler.

72
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,183
Who's he?

73
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,348
His name is Seth Kishorilal.

74
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,586
All right. Place them on duty.

75
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,588
Why're bodyguards being appointed
for Miss Kajal?

76
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,799
I fear that my enemies will try
to kidnap my daughter Kajal.

77
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,596
Your enemies?
- Yes.

78
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,865
Six months ago, a strange
incident happened...

79
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,374
when I was returning from Africa.

80
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,440
When the plane landed
at Beirut airport...

81
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:53,209
and I went to the cloak room, I saw
that a man was lying on the floor.

82
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,213
What happened to you?

83
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,882
Where are you going?
- To Delhi.

84
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:05,387
You appear to be a decent person.
Will you do me a favour?

85
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:11,231
Tell me.
- My son Rajesh in Delhi...

86
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:18,943
At Ashoka Hotel.
Give this to him.

87
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,079
What's this?
- My everything.

88
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,077
There you will...

89
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,953
Could the rascal
have gone inside?

90
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,740
I'd even staked my life
for those diamonds.

91
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,380
I wonder who went away with
those diamonds in my presence.

92
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,576
Didn't you see the face of that
man with the bicycle?

93
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:17,243
No. But the people who were
after those diamonds...

94
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,586
must be thinking that I cheated
them and ran away with the diamonds.

95
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,525
Has he cheated you too?

96
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:29,095
He has sent me this letter.
Have a look.

97
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,839
'Dear friend, your son is lying
unconscious in front of me'

98
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,437
'I regret that my henchmen beat him
mercilessly all night long'

99
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,647
'These people are demanding 3 million
rupees to release your son'

100
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,288
'You know that seeking police help
in such matters is futile'

101
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,281
'Even if the criminals
are caught... '

102
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,460
'the captive's corpse too
won't be found'

103
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,461
I've been given a month's time.

104
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,931
Even if I sell everything I have,
I cannot raise 3 million rupees.

105
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,639
O God! This man is such a devil!

106
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,643
He snatched a dying man's wealth
from his son.

107
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,145
He separated my son from me.

108
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,647
He himself is a father
of a daughter.

109
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,324
How would he feel if somebody
distances his daughter from him?

110
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,991
Mr. Saudagar, what's the age
of this man's daughter?

111
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,463
She must be around
15 or 16 years old.

112
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,960
What if we make this
girl disappear somehow?

113
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,331
What do you mean?

114
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,771
If we hide this girl somewhere
for a few days...

115
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,435
And then force Kishorilal that
till you don't get your son...

116
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,511
And I don't get my diamonds, his
daughter will not be back till then.

117
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:54,413
No, dear. We cannot do such a thing.
Only crooks do such things...

118
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,678
You don't understand.

119
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,187
We won't take this girl forcibly.
She will come with me willingly.

120
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,361
Rajesh has made
a very valid point.

121
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,961
What're you saying?

122
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:09,532
Neither do you have money, nor can
you seek the help of the police.

123
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,863
Then how will you
save your son?

124
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,702
But how will a rich man's daughter
meet someone who sings in a hotel?

125
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,876
One can find a way.
- How?

126
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,204
If Rajesh resigns from this job...

127
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,041
...and we put him up
in some plush hotel...

128
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,546
...and if he is presented before
Seth Kishorilal...

129
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,651
...as a millionaire's son.

130
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,146
But even after having
met you once...

131
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,382
what's the guarantee that
she will fall in love with you?

132
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,153
Don't worry.

133
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,727
That girl will be in my clutches
in the first meeting itself.

134
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,197
Daughter, I've made arrangements
for your trip to Nainital.

135
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,197
You can leave tomorrow
with your Aunty.

136
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:24,607
Just the two of us?
- No. These four too.

137
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,613
O father! What a pain!

138
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,342
Wherever I go, these four
baldies are after me all...

139
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,786
Don't talk too much.
- Get ready quickly.

140
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,321
You have reach the hotel
at 6 for the beauty contest.

141
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,125
I want to ask you something.

142
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,287
That bicycle in which you had
kept the belt with the diamonds...

143
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,626
Didn't you try to find out
who it belonged to?

144
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,803
I didn't get to know anything.
It was an ordinary cycle...

145
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,030
with a black tool-box.

146
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,308
There were only two letters
written on it... S and K.

147
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,646
Take this, and keep it there.

148
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,662
What's this, friend?

149
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,665
I'm leaving. See you again.

150
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:38,379
Father, look how wonderful
it's creator has made.

151
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,481
Look...
- Have you bought it?

152
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,184
Not yet. I brought it to show you.
- I've seen it. Return it.

153
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:51,692
Father, it's not very expensive.
It's cheap. Very cheap.

154
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,091
The old man doesn't get
taken in by such talk.

155
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,858
Return it.
- O father!

156
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,871
A girl... from the college.

157
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,554
Who's Sanjay talking to?
- Who knows?

158
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,220
Do you know, when I phone you...

159
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,394
I wonder which old man
picks up the phone.

160
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,729
When he hears my voice, he screams
a lot and disconnects the line.

161
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,462
That old man is my father.

162
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,399
Your father is such a devil!
- Yes, he is.

163
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,596
He doesn't even give me
money to buy the guitar.

164
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,435
Don't worry.
I will give you money.

165
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,406
When you don't meet me,
know what I do.

166
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,807
What?
- I shut my eyes and sit.

167
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,418
And then you appear before me
all of a sudden.

168
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:54,921
My heart begins to beat faster.
Then I extend my hand and hold yours.

169
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,457
Get lost from here, girl!

170
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,603
Stop, will you?
Where are you running away?

171
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,037
Who's this girl who came
to meet you?

172
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,178
She's my colleague
at the college.

173
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,609
Tell her that I don't like it
when she comes here.

174
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,682
You don't like her
coming here.

175
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,286
- Yes. And you too don't like it.
- And I don't too like it.

176
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,117
- Tell her this.
- Tell her this.

177
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,588
Rascal!

178
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,123
Don't worry, father.

179
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,058
I'm not interested in any girl.

180
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:44,403
I know. But I fear that
if you make some mistake...

181
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,736
how will I face my
friend Kishorilal?

182
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,409
Your marriage with his daughter
was finalised in your childhood.

183
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,412
How many years have passed
since separating from him?

184
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:02,150
12 years. But dear...
I strongly feel that...

185
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,764
I will meet my friend Kishorilal
very soon. And Kajal too.

186
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:15,067
Thereafter both of you will be
married with great pomp.

187
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:12,118
Kishorilal, instead of weeping,
you should be glad that...

188
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,848
God has saved your daughter
Kajal's life.

189
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,120
And know how sick
Brother Kishorilal is?

190
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,691
He is suffering from fever
and cough since so many days.

191
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,532
I'm feeling since
a few days that...

192
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,434
I won't be able to recover
from this ailment.

193
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,973
Why're you saying this?

194
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,675
Friend, I ask you for a promise.
- Speak up.

195
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:43,245
If you anything happens to me,
marry my daughter to your son Sanjay.

196
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,983
Gladly, Kishorilal.
- Not like this.

197
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,327
Take an oath in
front of God. Come.

198
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,995
I promise you in
the presence of God...

199
00:28:56,201 --> 00:29:00,331
that my son will marry your daughter
Kajal, and none other.

200
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,511
Son, put it on her hair parting.

201
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,490
Ever since that day,
I've been searching for you.

202
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,631
What're you blabbering?
- Nothing. Nothing, father.

203
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,734
Childhood photograph?
Why look at it now?

204
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,536
She must have grown up by now.

205
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,977
So beautiful that people would
call her a beauty queen.

206
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,831
What do you say?
How do you find her?

207
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,774
Do you like?
- Like?

208
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,341
What a body!
How colourful!

209
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:27,587
A special gift for you
on your birthday.

210
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,092
One doesn't find such
cars these days.

211
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,890
It's a very expensive car.
- One can see that.

212
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:38,228
You can, can't you? Here're its keys.
- Keys?

213
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,835
Yes, henceforth you'll
travel in this car.

214
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,370
I will keep your cycle inside.

215
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,769
Just a minute. I will keep my
lucky tool box in the car.

216
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,444
All right.

217
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,612
What a car it is!
How wonderful!

218
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,957
You!

219
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,796
I will take a ride.
- Yes, yes. Go ahead.

220
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:32,120
This is not a car, but an airplane.
- An airplane!

221
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:37,317
Let me read the newspaper.
- Here it is. Read the paper.

222
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:46,831
'The only daughter of Seth Kishorilal
the owner of Swadeshi Paper Mills... '

223
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,269
'Miss Kajal, has been awarded the
first prize in a beauty contest'

224
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,410
Hey! She's the same girl.

225
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,672
Both of us are the same people.

226
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,178
But both of us are
far apart from each other.

227
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,581
Aunty, he too will come
to Nainital with us.

228
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,355
Kajal, if we find these people,
will you marry Sanjay?

229
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:17,796
Why not? My marriage with him
had been finalised in my childhood.

230
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,027
What if they aren't wealthy
like you are?

231
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:29,404
Wealth? Wealth isn't everything.
I should like the boy too.

232
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,806
What're you talking?
- Father...

233
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,145
You are still searching for your
friend and Sanjay, aren't you?

234
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:41,519
I've searched for them a lot, dear.
It's better to forget about them now.

235
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,624
Will we never find them?
- Looks like it, dear.

236
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,890
When will you leave for Nainital?

237
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,062
Go and get ready soon.

238
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,146
Ram Kumar

239
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,921
It's so difficult to believe that
this is the same Kishorilal's home...

240
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,955
who didn't even have
shelter to hide his face.

241
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,861
Father, don't discuss
about marriage today.

242
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,157
Why?
- Not today. Some other time.

243
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:38,541
I'm the same Ram Kumar,
your old friend.

244
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,946
How are you, Ram Kumar?
- Let's embrace each other, friend.

245
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,451
I'm going mad with joy.
- Excuse me, sir.

246
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,280
I've to discuss a couple
of important things.

247
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,683
Sit there, Ram Kumar.
I will be back.

248
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,024
A cheque has to be sent today
for Bombay International.

249
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,994
For what amount?
- 1 million.

250
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,996
All right.
Prepare the cheque.

251
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,003
The party from Calcutta has
sent a order for 2 million.

252
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,297
What advance are they paying?
- They've sent a cheque...

253
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,907
for 5 lakhs as advance money.
- All right. Anything else?

254
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,134
The board meeting is scheduled
for 11 today morning.

255
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,815
So, Ram Kumar... tell me!

256
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,013
Everything is fine,
with God's grace.

257
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,153
Who's he? Your son Sanjay?

258
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,492
Yes. He's your Sanju.

259
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,026
Greet him.
- Greetings.

260
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,722
See... he's grown up. He has passed
his graduation this year.

261
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,329
He will take up a good job
and start working.

262
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:41,010
Kishorilal, after you went away,
I too lost interest in Nainital.

263
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,841
I came over to Delhi, and have been
searching for you ever since

264
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,852
Thank God that he listened
to my prayers and...

265
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,849
Presently, I am in a hurry.
I have to attend a board meeting.

266
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:59,519
Telephone me 10-15 days later.
I will surely make time for you.

267
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:08,364
We're meeting after so many years.
And you don't have time for me?

268
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:14,875
I'm helpless. I've a business worth
millions. Every moment is precious.

269
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,373
Come some other time.
I will surely meet you.

270
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,715
Let's go, father.
- Wait.

271
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,384
I can see that you have
changed a lot.

272
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,390
But I want to know whether you have
changed your mind about the promise?

273
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,391
What promise?
- The promise of...

274
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,997
Sanjay and Kajal's marriage. You'd
made me take oath in God's presence.

275
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,727
You had taken the oath, not I.
I agree you did it on my say-so.

276
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,902
But that was a different time.
This is a different time.

277
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:49,004
You're an intelligent man.
Considering my present position...

278
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,738
you shouldn't even mention
about that old matter.

279
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:56,075
Let's go, father.
- No. I haven't finished yet.

280
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,256
You carry on. I cannot stay
here any longer.

281
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:18,508
Your son is wise. He doesn't waste
time in understanding the main point.

282
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:24,045
Yes, he is intelligent that he
recognised you in a glance.

283
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,615
It's I who is a fool. I still
can't believe my own ears.

284
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,452
I still feel that you will
come rushing and embrace me...

285
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,148
and say that it was all a joke.

286
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,351
A joke? Why don't you understand?

287
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:43,795
What I had said 12 years ago,
was foolishness on my part.

288
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:48,171
I didn't know that destiny will
take me to such great heights...

289
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,964
that I won't be able
to marry my daughter...

290
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:53,439
to the son of an unknown, uneducated
and ordinary person.

291
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,646
Unknown? Uneducated?
Ordinary person?

292
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,484
And you had sought refuge in this
unknown man's home once...

293
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,317
That same uneducated man's home
was your shelter...

294
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,650
You had eaten at the same ordinary
man's place for months.

295
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,893
You, your sister and your daughter.

296
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:15,189
You shameless person! Even a dog
is loyal to those where he eats.

297
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,100
Even to call you a dog
is like insulting the dog.

298
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,165
Go ahead! Call your people.

299
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,103
You gutless man! I'm the
tiger from Punjab!

300
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,870
If anybody dares touch me,
I'll cut him like a carrot.

301
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,176
If you desire your well-being,
you'd better go away from here.

302
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,512
I will go. I sure will.

303
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:41,848
But remember... the way you have
ridiculed your friend's poverty...

304
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,393
I could perhaps forgive you for that,
but God will never forgive you.

305
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,524
When God hits,
there's no sound.

306
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,365
Fear that moment when neither your
wealth will come to your rescue...

307
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,700
nor your false respect.
And at that time...

308
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,808
you will come to my doorstep
seeking refuge.

309
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:04,880
But this time you won't get
shelter there too.

310
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,553
Sanjay too had come
with Mr. Ram Kumar?

311
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:21,261
Yes.
- You insulted them... threw them out?

312
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,403
You will have to answer God
for the sin you've committed.

313
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,994
Sanju... here.

314
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,437
Money?
- Yes.

315
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:08,601
You wanted to buy that new guitar,
didn't you? Go ahead and buy it.

316
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:14,040
And if you don't like the car
I'd gifted you on your birthday...

317
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:18,881
I will buy you another one.
A brand new one.

318
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:25,119
And look... don't worry.
Ask me for whatever you want.

319
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,971
Father, shall I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

320
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,804
Can you give me what I want?
- What do you want?

321
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,479
I want a smile on my father's lips.

322
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,646
Smile?
- Yes.

323
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:51,247
Henceforth, you will never think
about Kishorilal, nor about Kajal.

324
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,423
You don't think about Kajal?
- Not at all.

325
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,054
The world is full of
beautiful faces.

326
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,765
Whenever I feed the need,
I will pick up a flower...

327
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,401
and put it on the collar.

328
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,671
The main issue now is to
earn money... to get a job.

329
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,840
Job? Where will you
take up a job?

330
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,672
I will start searching a job
from tomorrow.

331
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,646
Let's see where destiny takes me.

332
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,843
By tomorrow, I will surely tell you
which of you people's offer I accept.

333
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,807
You want to know, don't you, whether
I approve of your offer or not?

334
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,948
Yes.
- Then listen...

335
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,448
Only your offer will be accepted.
None other's.

336
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,213
But how did you get to know about me?

337
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,720
This is the complete report of your
business and landed property.

338
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,224
Where did you get this?

339
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:13,234
I've done my business management
course from Switzerland.

340
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:18,301
We are taught there that before
accepting anybody's business offer...

341
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,739
it is very important to know his
position in the market.

342
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,105
Your son is very intelligent.

343
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,943
Is he married?
- Not yet.

344
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,518
But looks like he will be
married very soon.

345
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,589
To whom?
- Shall I tell him?

346
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,151
What's the use, dad?
I haven't decided still.

347
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,192
You like the girl, don't you?

348
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:47,427
I do like her. But I haven't met her.
I have only seen her.

349
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,096
Where?
- The thing is...

350
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,042
There was a beauty contest
here yesterday.

351
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,269
And the girl who was made
the beauty queen...

352
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,009
Her name...
- Kajal.

353
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,379
Yes, Kajal it is.
But how do you know?

354
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,181
What's the matter?
Do you know her?

355
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,382
Know her? She's my daughter!

356
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,618
Daughter?
- Yes.

357
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,798
Did you hear, Manjeet?
Kajal is his daughter.

358
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,803
It's amazing.
- It's me who's amazed at my luck.

359
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,473
I had come for a business deal.
But the matter progressed to this.

360
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,202
It's truly a matter of destiny.

361
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,481
I would've introduced him to
Kajal rightaway.

362
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,650
But she's left for Nainital
just this morning.

363
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,383
We too have a house in Nainital.
- Is it?

364
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,890
We have property of old times, we've
servants, and a estate manager too.

365
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:46,893
All right, then. Send him there.
He will meet Kajal there itself.

366
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,759
What say, dear?
- All right. I will go there.

367
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,428
So I should be leaving.

368
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,644
Ramu Uncle...
Here's your ticket for London.

369
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,846
Give this letter to Sunita.

370
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,676
And tell Sunita's father that
he may do whatever he likes.

371
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,682
Sunita will marry nobody but me.
- All right.

372
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,018
I'm going to Nainital for a few days.

373
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,850
I'll give my telephone number
there through a telegram.

374
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,355
Nice that you sent my luggage
to Nainital beforehand.

375
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,262
This is the youngster whom we
want to appoint for your sake.

376
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,369
Where do you work these days?
- Nowhere.

377
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,559
Look, this is the address
of the house... the keys...

378
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,232
And this is your advance.

379
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:10,312
Brother, I'm calling from the
hotel lobby. Shall I come upstairs?

380
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:15,916
No, Mala. Wait for me at the
coffee shop. I will join you.

381
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,770
O brother!

382
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,945
Brother, he is...
- I know him.

383
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,943
She's Mala, my sister.

384
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,345
How are you? Come, I've to
speak to you at the coffee shop.

385
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,224
He's the boy?
- Yes, Jack.

386
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,461
He will take us to that girl.

387
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,726
To Kajal?
- Yes. Kajal.

388
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,647
I'm the only one in this house.

389
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,974
And...

390
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:28,817
I take care of this bungalow.
- What's your name?

391
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,554
My name is Mithoo.

392
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,698
What a name!

393
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:42,335
Look, girl. If you do something,
you will be paid for it.

394
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:46,607
Yes, sir. A truck had come
from Dehli just a while ago.

395
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,842
A lot of goods have
arrived in it.

396
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:53,176
It must be Manjeet's things. Come on,
there's a lot of work to be done.

397
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,847
You are very beautiful.

398
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,852
Hello! Is that you, father?

399
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,028
Kajal dear, how are you?

400
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:10,528
I'm in a bad shape. Four ghosts
are over my head.

401
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,532
Tell me, father.

402
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:21,644
There's a businessman from Hong Kong.
His son Manjeet's coming to Nainital.

403
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,045
Yes, he saw you at the beauty
contest.

404
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,748
The boy is very handsome and noble.
I like him very much.

405
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,386
Do meet him.
- I sure will.

406
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:41,061
Look, manager. My son had left here
last evening for Nainital.

407
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,896
But he has just called
from some village...

408
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,467
that there's been a landslide
on the road to Nainital...

409
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,069
and the road has got blocked.

410
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,398
You do this immediately.
- Yes, tell me.

411
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,076
Go to Bungalow number 15
on the Mall Road.

412
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,902
Kajal, Seth Kishorilal's daughter
from Delhi is living there.

413
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,150
What name did you say?
- Kajal, Seth Kishorilal's daughter.

414
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,585
Yes.
- As soon as he reaches there...

415
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,258
he will telephone Kajal.
- He will telephone Kajal.

416
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,359
Not Kajal. Say Miss Kajal.

417
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:14,296
Don't you know that she is going
to be married to my son Manjeet?

418
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,974
Manjeet Kumar Dana...

419
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,407
What's the difference
between you and I?

420
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,547
If at all, the only difference
is in our wealth.

421
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,810
And on the strength of that wealth
you are stealing that girl too...

422
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:16,755
who has been made mine before you.
But I will never let it happen.

423
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:22,664
Kajal was mine, she is mine,
and she will remain mine.

424
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:36,570
What're you trying to do, Sanjay?
Have you thought of the consequences?

425
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,690
My name is Kajal.

426
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:02,099
My father had telephoned me from
Delhi... to meet you.

427
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:05,900
Please come.

428
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,542
Come in, Aunty.

429
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:09,803
Greetings, Aunty.
- Bless you.

430
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,156
May we sit?

431
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,631
Yes, please.

432
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,060
Sit, Aunty.

433
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,570
Actually, I...

434
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,237
They are your...
- My bodyguards.

435
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,747
Carry on your conversation with
Kajal. I've work to do.

436
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,077
All right. Greetings.
- Bless you.

437
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:02,221
Alas, only if you were
my childhood companion.

438
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,266
How should I tell you that
I'm your childhood companion?

439
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:12,531
Father says that Sanjay
will never be found.

440
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,267
And that it's better to forget him.

441
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,276
I wanted to forget you.

442
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,543
But after meeting you now, it will be
very difficult to forget you.

443
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,454
He must be wondering
why I'm silent.

444
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,683
She must be wondering
why I'm silent.

445
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,618
So...

446
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,468
Do these people accompany you
everywhere?

447
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,629
Yes. Everywhere.

448
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,136
Don't you feel suffocating?
- I do. A lot.

449
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,810
How about fooling them and
running away from here?

450
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,145
Lt'll be great fun. But how?

451
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,495
Who's that girl?
- She's the gardener's daughter.

452
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,037
I've got an idea.
Come with me quickly.

453
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,682
Where's Prakash?
- He's gone for shopping.

454
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,350
Listen...

455
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,850
But what will I wear?

456
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,189
Here you are.
Come on. Be quick.

457
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,378
Is it okay?

458
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,378
I will fool these people
and come right back.

459
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,804
Bye!

460
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,681
He's taken away my girl!

461
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:46,426
Colonel Subodh Mukerji.

462
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,663
Gardener, I'm going to the club.

463
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:53,768
My nephew Shomu will be
coming from Delhi.

464
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,038
Ask him to call me up
at the club.

465
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,438
And take care of the house. Lot of
thefts are happening these days.

466
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,306
All right, sir.

467
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,455
The baldies have come.

468
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,799
Gardener, where's my dear Uncle?

469
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,028
He's gone to the Club. He has asked
you to telephone him there.

470
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,866
All right.

471
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:46,688
I want to speak to the Colonel.
Call him quickly. It's urgent.

472
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,892
I'm your neighbour speaking.

473
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,698
Come back quickly. Thieves
have entered your home.

474
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,659
And the gardner...
- They've hit your gardner...

475
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,994
...and made him unconscious.
Come back quickly.

476
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,500
Let's hurry up.

477
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,521
Go there.

478
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,521
And you go there.

479
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,245
The rascal has run away
with my girl.

480
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,882
Let him return. Then I will...

481
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,555
Who are you?

482
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,254
You are wearing my dress,
and calling me shut up?

483
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:05,833
What happened?

484
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,402
Change your dresses.
I'll tell you what next.

485
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,064
Remember Prakash. I'm not Sanjay.
- You aren't Sanjay.

486
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,904
I'm Manjit Kumar Dana.
- You are Manjit Kumar Dana.

487
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,875
You are my servant.
- You are my servant.

488
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,275
Not I. You are my servant.
- Not I. You are my servant.

489
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,982
What're you staring at?

490
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,927
Move back. Why're you
blocking the way?

491
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,003
What're you doing here?
Move back.

492
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,455
Colonel... colonel!
- Here I am.

493
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:10,323
Catch these people.

494
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,638
Look at them!

495
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,659
It's a lovely tune.
What song is it?

496
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,993
Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.

497
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,665
Here it goes.

498
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:39,388
This song is from the South. It is
sung only somebody falls in love.

499
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,818
You didn't ask why I sang this song?

500
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:50,461
There's a song in our East too.
You can understand the girl's reply.

501
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,464
Is it? What's the song?

502
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,213
I had been thinking since
morning that...

503
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,544
as soon as you come,
I will tell you...

504
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,883
Tell me what?
- That...

505
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:21,063
You wanted to say something.

506
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,322
Nothing.
- Tell me.

507
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,794
Look over there! What
a lovely butterfly! Isn't it?

508
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:33,232
Maybe. You were saying something.

509
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:40,473
That I'm very happy
having come to Nainital.

510
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,076
And you are also happy
after meeting me?

511
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:46,086
Yes.

512
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:50,783
Do you know... I had spent my
childhood right here in Nainital?

513
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,756
Is it?
- Yes.

514
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:56,094
And I had a very good friend
in my childhood.

515
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,431
Friend? Do you remember his name?

516
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:03,099
Sanjay.
- Sanjay?

517
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:06,373
I know very well
a boy by this name.

518
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,836
Is his father's name Ram Kumar?
- Yes.

519
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,011
Where does he live?
- Right here in Nainital.

520
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,773
Take me there rightaway.
- You are so restless?

521
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,816
If you know me well...

522
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:25,385
I've understood. You don't
know any Sanjay. You are lying.

523
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,787
Lying? Look, Kajal...

524
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:34,799
Looks like the cops
released them too soon.

525
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:39,134
Let them be. Tell me,
do you really know Sanjay?

526
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:44,145
Let's do this. I will call him to
my home this evening.

527
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,649
Come there and meet him.
- Okay. At what time?

528
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,308
At 5 o'clock.

529
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:04,760
Now neither do I need your
clothes, nor your name.

530
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,564
Sanjay will be
in front of Kajal today.

531
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,839
Her 'yes' or 'no' will
decide my fate.

532
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,445
She's come very soon.

533
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,935
Where's the bedroom?
- That way.

534
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,191
Aunty, let me speak to Kajal.

535
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:11,430
What? She has already left?
All right.

536
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,637
I'm going out. If Manjeet
says something...

537
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,245
Who's this cartoon?
- He's our cook Prakash.

538
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,249
What a fool! Get going.

539
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,502
My name is Manjeet Kumar Dana.

540
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,677
What?
- Is the name long?

541
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,611
You can call me just Manjeet.

542
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:09,691
Come on.

543
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,294
Actually I was supposed
to have come here yesterday.

544
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,462
But I was held up because
the road was blocked.

545
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:22,302
My manager must have informed you.

546
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,503
Manager?
- Yes, manager.

547
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,509
He informed you, didn't he?
- Yes.

548
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,209
Why're you standing? Please sit.

549
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,922
Hot tea, manager.
- Yes.

550
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:49,921
I was about to telephone you
that my luck...

551
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:54,157
The bell rang, and I found you
right in front of me.

552
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:02,536
You don't seem happy upon meeting me?
- No, nothing of the sort.

553
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,348
Look, don't reject me so soon.

554
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,183
Even if you have to reject me,
let it be a couple of days later.

555
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,851
So that I can think how
I should commit suicide.

556
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:16,623
By consuming poison, with the noose,
or by jumping off a hill.

557
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:20,094
What're you saying?
- I'm right, madam.

558
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:23,695
I've been to Hong Kong, London,
Paris, New York... all over the world.

559
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:27,630
But I didn't see any face anywhere
worth giving a second look.

560
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,271
But you are smashing!

561
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:34,031
I lost my senses when I saw you.
I got crazy!

562
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,380
The thing is, my head is paining.

563
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:46,044
I will cure it in a jiffy.
But give me a smile once.

564
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:52,794
How wonderful!

565
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:59,792
The sunshine has appeared,
the flowers have blossomed.

566
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,066
Manager, hot tea for the madam.

567
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,398
I will get the pill for
the headache rightaway.

568
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:10,742
I want to tell you something.

569
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,809
I don't want to cause harm
to anybody's livelihood.

570
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:18,076
Else, if I tell Manjit about it,
he will dismiss you rightaway.

571
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,255
But listen...
- Despite being merely a manager...

572
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,253
how could you dare do all this,

573
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,255
Look, Kajal...

574
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,429
Here, madam.

575
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:32,089
This tablet is from King Kong,
the famous doctor from Hong Kong...

576
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,428
which makes a person fit
and fine in a jiffy. Try it.

577
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,597
Gosh! You have such
a wonderful smile!

578
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:40,932
Swallow it with tea.

579
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,145
Do you know a grand programme is
going to be held today?

580
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,941
Where?
- Here in Nainital.

581
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,844
Look at this.

582
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,851
Whoever dances and sings the best,
will get a gold medal.

583
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,052
Are you participating?
- Participating?

584
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:00,451
Accompany me and see for yourself.
The gold medal'll be around my neck.

585
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,460
You will come, won't you?

586
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,298
I sure will.

587
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:11,064
I'm wonderstruck!
With you on my side...

588
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,813
Who are these rascals?
- They are Miss Kajal's bodyguards.

589
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,643
I'm sorry, friends.

590
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:27,481
I've just been informed that
you are bodyguards, not donkeys.

591
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,821
So what was I saying...

592
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,494
Do they stay with you always?
- Yes.

593
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,097
To the club too?
- Yes.

594
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,326
Why?
- Dad's orders.

595
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,771
Shall we leave?
- Yes.

596
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:01,221
Yes?
- Do you have medicine...

597
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:05,689
for diarrhoea? For the horses?
- Yes. How many horses do you have?

598
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,529
Four.
- Here you are.

599
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,859
The dosage is enough for four
horses for four days.

600
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,532
Their stomach will be
cleansed totally.

601
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,864
It's priced at five rupees.
- Five...

602
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,063
What will you have?
- Nothing.

603
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,405
You drink tea. I will go home.

604
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,976
How can it be? Then who will
see my dance at the club?

605
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,577
Two cokes for us, and...

606
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,177
What would you like to have?

607
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:08,487
Nothing? That's not possible.
Get hot tea for all of them.

608
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,601
I'll explain to you.

609
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,004
Do you see this button?
By pressing this button...

610
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:36,309
the watch becomes magnetic and
pulls the heaviest of things.

611
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,290
Watch the fun now.
- What?

612
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,379
But listen...

613
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:20,218
Thank God at least you smiled.

614
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,060
I will be right back.

615
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:32,535
Yes, sure. You will
get four rooms.

616
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,376
How many? You are two men?
And four rooms...

617
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,011
Our order?
- Yes.

618
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,681
It's not cold. Get ice.
- Rightaway.

619
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:49,623
Yes, there are bathrooms
in every room.

620
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:53,017
Yes, please do come.

621
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:57,864
We serve all kinds of foodstuffs.

622
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,032
Yes, we serve everything.
You should visit us.

623
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:13,874
What's the matter, sir?

624
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:18,051
Do you want to make a call?
- Yes.

625
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,721
What's the number?

626
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,737
You didn't like the number?
Let it be.

627
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,146
There was some urgent work.
Why don't you start?

628
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,159
Now watch the fun
with these four baldies.

629
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:01,756
What do you mean?

630
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:04,296
I've mixed medicine for
diarrhoea in their tea.

631
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,263
What?

632
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,459
Keep a watch on them.
I will be right back.

633
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,062
I will be right back.

634
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,326
What did you mix in our tea?
- Nothing.

635
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,428
You did mix something.
- Come on. Tell us.

636
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,101
What's the matter?
- What's the matter, you ask?

637
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,667
Something has been mixed in our tea.
We're suffering from diarrhoea.

638
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:20,535
How can you say that?
Our tea is the finest.

639
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,106
No! Something has surely
been mixed in it.

640
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:27,005
You are doubtful?
I will drink and demonstrate.

641
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:38,850
Nothing has been mixed in it.

642
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,829
You people are suspecting it
unnecessarily. It's such a fine tea.

643
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,487
So we have put these baldies
to their right place.

644
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:12,724
Shall we go the club now?
- I've to go home first.

645
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,162
Why?
- I've some work.

646
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:10,546
In this dance-and-song contest...

647
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,778
this one was the fifth challenger
whom Mr. Manjeet has defeated.

648
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:18,118
If a new challenger doesn't come
out on the field in 15 seconds...

649
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:20,453
the prize will be given away
to Mr. Manjeet.

650
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,343
When did you come?
- Just a while ago.

651
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:11,878
Tell me, where had you been?
- To the club.

652
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,718
Father, who were those people?

653
01:28:15,757 --> 01:28:20,251
New bodyguards. The earlier ones
were useless. I dismissed them.

654
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:24,963
I met your daddy in Delhi.
He too will be coming soon.

655
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:26,895
Daddy will be calling any time.
May I go, sir?

656
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:30,068
Okay. Let me see you off.
- Kajal, he?

657
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,831
Here's the advance which
your father gave me.

658
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:39,839
But why do you want to leave the job?

659
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:44,183
I'm helpless. But I have
no complaints against you.

660
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:50,283
All right. Let me arrange for another
manager. You may go thereafter.

661
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:53,590
It's a matter of only a day or two.
- All right.

662
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:05,605
Sanjay, I've received
a letter from your father.

663
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,769
He's coming over for the prayers
on the occasion of Shivratri.

664
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:13,981
I've resigned from the job.
- Is that all? You've ran away?

665
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:18,111
People even commit murders in love.
- What nonsense!

666
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:19,785
It's true.

667
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:24,286
Manjeet has snatched his beloved.
He should kill Manjeet.

668
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:30,021
If he can't, I can.
- Lay off, will you?

669
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:46,373
Rajesh dear, I'm Ramu Uncle
speaking from London.

670
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,311
Yes, Ramu Uncle. Tell me.
Did you meet Sunita?

671
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:53,248
How could I meet her, dear?
She has even got married.

672
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,880
Marriage? What're you saying?

673
01:29:57,091 --> 01:30:00,356
Yes, dear. It's better
to forget about her now.

674
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,669
Sunita has got married?

675
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,004
Sunita got married!

676
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,183
Sunita got married!

677
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:45,834
But what is this for?

678
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:50,704
To remind you. Only you are
there in my heart.

679
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,207
There will be none other.

680
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,718
I have complete trust on you.

681
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:05,023
And I don't trust you at all.

682
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:10,722
My daddy says you are the greatest
flirt in the whole of London.

683
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:15,934
You lose control the moment
you see a beautiful face.

684
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:23,740
A lot of beautiful faces have
come into your life, and gone too.

685
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:28,438
Then why do you love me?
- I'm helpless.

686
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:33,249
Your face is so charming,
that I can't control myself.

687
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:38,919
You and your charming...

688
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,166
Don't be scared. Daddy has
gone to Paris.

689
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:53,163
Else, would I have called you home?
- I know that quite well.

690
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:57,103
I'm very scared of Daddy's anger.

691
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:02,607
Do you know... he wants me to get
married to Motiram's son Ranjeet.

692
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:08,782
And you?
- Do you need to ask that.

693
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,399
Welcome, Mr. Motiram.
Come, Ranjeet.

694
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,500
Greetings, Uncle.
- Bless you, dear.

695
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:30,744
Daddy, you were...
- Yes, I couldn't go to Paris.

696
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:34,639
They called me from Birmingham
that they're coming to London.

697
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:39,075
Since India's Independence Day
is being celebrated today...

698
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,521
They've come here in that connection
and they will be staying here.

699
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:46,488
Mr. Motiram, he's Mr. Rajesh.

700
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:53,499
He's Mr. Ranjeet...

701
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:57,831
Mr. Motiram's son, and my
daughter's future husband.

702
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:06,003
So Mr. Motiram, you people had
better get ready.

703
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:08,842
Please come.

704
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:26,861
I want to tell you something.

705
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:30,870
Perhaps you aren't aware that...

706
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:32,869
...today, on the occasion of the
Independence Day celebrations...

707
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:35,201
I and Sunita'll be singing a quwwali
today. And both of us together...

708
01:33:37,645 --> 01:33:39,704
My daughter won't participate
in any programme with you.

709
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:43,380
I've given my word to the club.
I will get a bad name.

710
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,219
Is this your final decision?

711
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:52,884
Then you too had better hear this,
Mr. Kewalchand.

712
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:57,492
Not just today, but at every stage of
my life, Sunita will side with me.

713
01:33:57,765 --> 01:34:01,667
Despite knowing that Sunita and
I love each other intensely...

714
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:03,894
you still want to get her
married to someone else.

715
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:06,403
But you cannot force your
whims on us.

716
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:11,510
You may commit any atrocity on us but
you can never separate us.

717
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,743
Don't think that I cannot
respond to your slap.

718
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,748
I haven't raised my hand on you
thinking that...

719
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:25,323
I will be having another kind of
relationship with you in future.

720
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:50,510
What I had said is happening.

721
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:56,114
What will you do now?
She won't be singing the quwwali.

722
01:34:56,857 --> 01:35:01,624
Let's replace Sunita with Uma.
She remembers the entire quwwali.

723
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:04,490
No! Sunita's place will be
kept vacant.

724
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,463
But who will sing Sunita's portions?
- Sunita herself will sing.

725
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:25,742
Friends, on this occasion of
Independence Day Celebrations...

726
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:28,979
I and my associates'll be presenting
a quwwali before you.

727
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:35,595
But let me tell you that today's
quwwali is not merely a quwwali...

728
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:39,994
but it has also become a big test
of my life... of my love.

729
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:44,494
If my quwwali isn't completed,
my life will remain incomplete.

730
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:49,339
So it's my promise
to this packed gathering...

731
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:51,670
The hands which had
taken oaths of love...

732
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:53,744
while putting this necklace
around my neck...

733
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:56,348
Those hands will either put this
necklace on my neck again...

734
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:59,610
or this night will be
the last night of my life.

735
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:41,470
Liar! Cheat!

736
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:50,485
Keep my luggage in the room.

737
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:54,494
What's the matter, Rajesh?

738
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:58,498
You appear very worried.

739
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,195
I was to have married
a girl in London.

740
01:44:04,504 --> 01:44:06,495
Yesterday she was married
to somebody else.

741
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:14,343
Anyway, Mr. Saudagar hasn't come?
- He's ill.

742
01:44:15,282 --> 01:44:17,182
He'll come in a couple of days.

743
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:26,185
What's the progress on
Kajal's front?

744
01:44:30,063 --> 01:44:33,294
Have you thought where we will hide
Kajal after bringing her?

745
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,867
Yes. About 300 miles from here...

746
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:40,233
there's a no man's land outside
India's borders.

747
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:42,541
We will keep the girl there
in a cottage.

748
01:44:42,743 --> 01:44:46,611
And as soon as our conditions are
fulfilled, we'll send the girl back.

749
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:48,872
But how will we take Kajal
across the border?

750
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,949
I've arranged for a helicopter
and a pilot for that job.

751
01:44:56,657 --> 01:44:58,716
I too know how to fly a helicopter.

752
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:05,391
Bring Kajal tomorrow at 11 o'clock
to the ground behind the polo ground.

753
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:10,562
But what about Kajal's bodyguards?

754
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:15,969
I've thought of a way
to ward them off.

755
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:31,918
Girl! Are both the horses fine?
- Yes.

756
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:34,988
This white horse is meant for you.
- No, I like that horse.

757
01:45:35,195 --> 01:45:37,425
No, no. Boss will ride it.
- I will ride it.

758
01:45:37,631 --> 01:45:39,792
You talk too much. Out!

759
01:46:05,425 --> 01:46:09,885
Go and stop them, Mr. Sanjay.
The white horse is crazy.

760
01:46:10,831 --> 01:46:12,799
Crazy?
- Yes. The moment it is whipped...

761
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:15,126
it will get out of control.
- What're you saying?

762
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:19,369
I thought Manjit will sit on the
white horse and die today itself.

763
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:21,632
How crazy you are!

764
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,058
Hold on, Kajal.
I will be back.

765
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,758
Grab my feet, Kajal.

766
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:34,770
Come on... pull us!

767
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,672
Hold me tight. Don't leave me.

768
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:52,789
Bravo!

769
01:48:57,697 --> 01:49:00,188
Come on...

770
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:22,586
Manjeet dear, the way you have
saved my daughter's life...

771
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:24,984
I can never ever forget it.

772
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:31,826
Now look, Kajal dear...

773
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:36,833
From today, stop going out
unnecessarily. No horse-riding.

774
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:40,439
Even if you have to go out
with Manjeet...

775
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,268
The driver will drive the vehicle,
and bodyguards will accompany you.

776
01:49:44,644 --> 01:49:47,010
Alongwith the bodyguards?
- Always.

777
01:49:47,847 --> 01:49:51,010
If you wish to speak in private,
the house is always there.

778
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:56,853
Malti, please come.
I've to tell you something.

779
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:04,858
What happened?
- Your father is a strange man.

780
01:50:05,298 --> 01:50:08,859
Bodyguards all the time!
Look, I've come here to meet you.

781
01:50:09,069 --> 01:50:11,094
And if we've to go around with
these musclemen, I will go away.

782
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:12,862
So much anger?
- Of course.

783
01:50:13,306 --> 01:50:15,206
I'll wait for you at Nandi Hill
at 10 o'clock.

784
01:50:15,475 --> 01:50:17,443
And you will come all alone.
Understand?

785
01:50:20,513 --> 01:50:22,276
I will still wait for you.

786
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:26,576
And if you don't come, I will
walk out of your life.

787
01:50:36,529 --> 01:50:38,394
If you had brought Kajal today...

788
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:40,156
we would've accomplished our
objective within 2-3 days.

789
01:50:43,169 --> 01:50:45,603
But she's coming to meet me tomorrow
morning at 10 at Nandi Hill.

790
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:49,238
Your helicopter is ready, isn't it?
- It is.

791
01:50:50,377 --> 01:50:52,436
It's possible that she might not
agree to enter the helicopter.

792
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:54,169
I've found a way out for that.

793
01:50:58,218 --> 01:50:59,913
Liquor?

794
01:51:02,856 --> 01:51:04,915
A white horse deceived me today.

795
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:09,124
Tomorrow I will seek help
of this white horse.

796
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:22,097
You have broken my heart today.

797
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:24,440
You'd better remember, you cheat...

798
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:28,546
That I will keep on drinking
in your grief and then die.

799
01:51:34,988 --> 01:51:37,218
What for have you come here?

800
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:39,356
Tell me.

801
01:51:39,559 --> 01:51:41,356
I have come alone.

802
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:44,956
At 11 o'clock?

803
01:51:45,999 --> 01:51:48,661
I was delayed a bit since
I had to come out on the sly.

804
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:52,964
You do everything on the sly. You
won't be able to do anything bravely.

805
01:51:53,306 --> 01:51:56,969
Do you know, dad told me last night
again that if I go alone anywhere...

806
01:51:57,177 --> 01:51:59,975
he will skin me alive.
- Oh come on!

807
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,977
Why doesn't he become a butcher?

808
01:52:02,182 --> 01:52:05,982
Tell him to put on a dirty vest
and then skin sheeps and goats.

809
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:07,981
His hobby will be fulfilled
and he will get money too.

810
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:12,188
Don't drink so much liquor?
- Why shouldn't I?

811
01:52:12,859 --> 01:52:14,588
My heart has been shattered.
Not yours.

812
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:20,393
I saw you, I worshipped you.
I even staked my life to rescue you.

813
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:23,399
And you...

814
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:27,739
You don't even love me?
- I promise you.

815
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:30,106
Henceforth I will do
whatever you say.

816
01:52:30,343 --> 01:52:32,436
Lie!
- Try for yourself.

817
01:52:35,215 --> 01:52:37,945
You won't refuse anything?
- Never.

818
01:52:40,386 --> 01:52:43,014
Drink liquor.
- What?

819
01:52:43,223 --> 01:52:46,681
Liquor. And till I don't say,
keep the bottle glued to your lips.

820
01:52:54,467 --> 01:52:58,699
Drink to your heart's content.
You have to go far today.

821
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:02,503
And you will return after
I get my diamonds.

822
01:53:04,144 --> 01:53:06,044
That's enough... enough.

823
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,374
Why're you weeping?

824
01:53:11,384 --> 01:53:13,443
You made me drink liquor.
- So?

825
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,445
I've committed a sin.
- Sin?

826
01:53:19,726 --> 01:53:22,456
Something is happening to me.
- What is happening now?

827
01:53:23,696 --> 01:53:25,561
Everything is moving.
- Is it?

828
01:53:28,434 --> 01:53:30,061
Everything is going round and round.

829
01:53:35,942 --> 01:53:37,910
What happened now?

830
01:53:41,948 --> 01:53:43,916
How is your face looking?

831
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:50,917
Gosh! It has become so fat!
Just like bread!

832
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:11,936
You are laughing, you rascal!

833
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:15,277
Hey! What're you doing?

834
01:54:15,481 --> 01:54:19,713
Tell me, will you leave me?
- Why would I? Have I gone mad?

835
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:22,717
Do you love me?
- Yes, I do.

836
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:24,617
Will you marry me?
- Definitely.

837
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:29,122
Come on... then kiss me.
- What?

838
01:54:29,329 --> 01:54:31,126
Kiss!

839
01:54:33,099 --> 01:54:37,399
All this, after marriage.
- After marriage, eh?

840
01:54:38,104 --> 01:54:39,833
After marriage...

841
01:54:46,579 --> 01:54:49,309
Why this?
- I was testing you.

842
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:54,309
After marriage, if we quarreled,
and if I slapped you...

843
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:58,752
Would you get upset with me?
- No, no. Nothing of the sort.

844
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:01,825
After marriage,
you can slap me thrice.

845
01:55:08,868 --> 01:55:10,335
Why're you looking at the
watch repeatedly?

846
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:13,369
I was looking at the time.
- You were looking at the time?

847
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:17,176
I thought you are
looking at the time.

848
01:55:18,344 --> 01:55:20,938
What time is it?
- 28 minutes past 11.

849
01:55:21,147 --> 01:55:24,674
28 minutes past 11? Gosh!
I should be leaving.

850
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:26,442
My father will kill me!

851
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:25,981
Hey! What happened?

852
02:00:27,787 --> 02:00:30,881
Promise me that you will
always love me.

853
02:00:31,157 --> 02:00:32,818
That you will never betray me.

854
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:36,387
Speak up. Why don't you speak?

855
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:43,328
Madam, I am going to cheat
you tremendously.

856
02:00:43,536 --> 02:00:46,994
You are intoxicated. You will
go to sleep soon. And then...

857
02:00:48,207 --> 02:00:49,970
Then you will go and sell me off.

858
02:00:51,277 --> 02:00:54,678
Sell me if you want to.
What will you get in return?

859
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:57,608
Gold, silver, diamonds?

860
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:02,915
As it is, you're getting all that.
- What do you mean?

861
02:01:03,556 --> 02:01:05,683
Here... read it.

862
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:12,525
You criticise my father, don't you?
He has made this through his lawyer.

863
02:01:12,732 --> 02:01:14,927
So you are being made a shareholder
in his property?

864
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:16,530
Yes.
- And so...

865
02:01:16,736 --> 02:01:18,704
you didn't reach there with Kajal?

866
02:01:20,273 --> 02:01:23,538
Why did we want to
make Kajal disappear?

867
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:27,140
For your diamonds. And to rescue
Mr. Saudagar's son.

868
02:01:27,346 --> 02:01:30,144
Both these things can be
done with Kajal's help.

869
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:33,877
That girl is so crazy for me.
I can make her do anything I want.

870
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:36,551
But till yesterday, you loved
some other girl.

871
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:40,285
I still love her.

872
02:01:43,596 --> 02:01:45,564
But she has been married.

873
02:01:45,998 --> 02:01:48,762
Anyway, I'm not prepared
to cheat Kajal.

874
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:52,961
I will tell her all the truth.
- No. Don't tell her anything as yet.

875
02:01:53,172 --> 02:01:55,072
Why?
- Let me telephone Delhi...

876
02:01:55,274 --> 02:01:58,471
and ask Saudagar Singh. It's
a question of his son's life.

877
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:02,913
All right. Ask him.

878
02:02:10,723 --> 02:02:15,387
Wow! You spoke about your
benefit so breezingly.

879
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:20,597
You're amazing, Mr. Baljeet.

880
02:02:23,135 --> 02:02:25,865
Dear, my spectacles are
in your bag.

881
02:02:26,972 --> 02:02:29,270
I've forgotten my bag in the car.
I'll get it rightaway.

882
02:02:44,256 --> 02:02:45,780
I'm going away from here today.

883
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:50,288
I want to tell you something.
- I don't want to hear anything.

884
02:02:51,497 --> 02:02:53,226
Let me tell you why
I posed as Manjeet.

885
02:02:54,467 --> 02:02:56,025
Get out of my path.

886
02:02:58,504 --> 02:03:01,166
You will have to listen to me.
- Leave my hand.

887
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:03,842
I won't.
- Leave my hand, I say.

888
02:03:12,885 --> 02:03:15,820
Who's this man?
- He's my estate manager.

889
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:20,649
What's the matter, Kajal?

890
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:25,495
I didn't tell you till today that
before you arrived here...

891
02:03:25,698 --> 02:03:27,495
He met me posing as Manjeet.

892
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,930
He didn't give up even after
he was exposed.

893
02:03:30,136 --> 02:03:32,366
And he wrote this
letter to me.

894
02:03:42,381 --> 02:03:45,680
Have you written this letter?
- What right do you have...

895
02:03:45,885 --> 02:03:48,945
to question me? I'm not your servant.
- May be not.

896
02:03:49,722 --> 02:03:52,122
But you have grabbed her hands
in my home.

897
02:03:53,392 --> 02:03:57,192
If I've grabbed her hands,
I've a right on them.

898
02:03:59,732 --> 02:04:03,031
Don't raise your hands, Mister.
My hands are not severed.

899
02:04:03,335 --> 02:04:05,030
Get this rascal!

900
02:04:50,783 --> 02:04:52,580
That's enough. Stop them.

901
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:07,760
Come... which coward wants to come?
Come forward, if you are true men!

902
02:05:09,401 --> 02:05:12,928
My son's blood is very precious,
you rich people.

903
02:05:13,772 --> 02:05:17,765
I will kill all of you
for every drop of his blood.

904
02:05:17,977 --> 02:05:19,774
Let it be, father.

905
02:05:21,146 --> 02:05:23,478
Who's this man?
- How can he say?

906
02:05:24,216 --> 02:05:26,150
I will tell you who I am.
- Father...

907
02:05:26,352 --> 02:05:29,913
Don't say anything else.
Not a word more.

908
02:05:31,924 --> 02:05:34,484
Don't insult me by telling
the reality about me.

909
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:36,825
You are under oath.

910
02:05:51,043 --> 02:05:54,638
These people are strange.
Do you know them?

911
02:05:54,914 --> 02:05:57,314
No, I saw them for the
first time today.

912
02:05:57,850 --> 02:06:00,410
Let's go.
- Come on.

913
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:07,823
What happened, Aunty?
- Nothing. Go ahead. I'll come.

914
02:06:12,698 --> 02:06:17,761
I had come for a job. But destiny
brought me face-to-face with Kajal.

915
02:06:19,038 --> 02:06:21,506
And the words spoken by you
since so many years...

916
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:26,837
That Kajal is my goal, my life...
Your words became a reality.

917
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:32,013
Does she know who you are?
- No.

918
02:06:34,053 --> 02:06:37,113
Father, tomorrow after your worship,
we will go back to Delhi.

919
02:06:37,723 --> 02:06:41,022
Where are you going now, son?
- Take rest, father.

920
02:06:41,627 --> 02:06:43,356
I will go to sleep
in Prakash's room.

921
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:10,054
What's the matter, Madam?

922
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:13,883
I see that you've become upset
ever since the manager has gone?

923
02:07:14,093 --> 02:07:16,152
No, no. Nothing of the sort.

924
02:07:30,442 --> 02:07:31,909
I will make a call and come back.

925
02:07:49,461 --> 02:07:53,420
You've chased me here too?
- I've never chased you, Kajal.

926
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:57,324
It's destiny which is bringing me
face-to-face with you repeatedly.

927
02:07:58,570 --> 02:08:00,936
Do you know why?
- I don't want to know.

928
02:08:01,473 --> 02:08:05,136
I only know that you are
a liar, a fraud.

929
02:08:30,002 --> 02:08:32,129
See? He came here too.

930
02:08:34,006 --> 02:08:35,974
Love is a very bad thing, Kajal.

931
02:08:36,875 --> 02:08:38,365
A normal person too
can go crazy.

932
02:08:45,117 --> 02:08:49,315
The lovely couple that you see
on the table opposite me...

933
02:08:49,521 --> 02:08:51,489
They are Mr. And Mrs. Salim.

934
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:54,150
Their marriage had been fixed
in their childhood...

935
02:08:54,359 --> 02:08:55,986
and they separated in their childhood
in such a way that...

936
02:08:56,195 --> 02:08:57,321
they gave up hope of meeting again.

937
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:00,498
But destiny brought them
together again.

938
02:09:00,699 --> 02:09:03,327
Today is their first
marriage anniversary.

939
02:09:04,036 --> 02:09:09,338
On this beautiful union,
if any of you has any song...

940
02:09:09,541 --> 02:09:12,339
you can come and sing it here.
- I will sing a song for them.

941
02:09:29,228 --> 02:09:31,196
Congratulations to you
on this beautiful union.

942
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:37,525
But on this joyous day, if you
remember those who couldn't meet...

943
02:09:37,736 --> 02:09:40,534
you will then realise
how fortunate you are.

944
02:09:41,573 --> 02:09:45,202
So the song that I'm singing now
is not a union song...

945
02:09:45,944 --> 02:09:49,380
but of those unfortunate ones
who were rejected...

946
02:09:50,349 --> 02:09:52,510
of those who were cheated.

947
02:14:27,793 --> 02:14:29,920
Forget whatever has happened
between us.

948
02:14:45,777 --> 02:14:50,339
What's the use of weeping now?
Forget whatever has happened.

949
02:14:51,516 --> 02:14:53,507
I won't forget till death.

950
02:14:53,785 --> 02:14:58,518
And I also won't forget that my
father is responsible for my sins.

951
02:14:59,257 --> 02:15:02,021
He always lied to me.

952
02:15:06,465 --> 02:15:10,526
If I've lied to you,
it is for your own good.

953
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:16,373
Now you cannot decide
what's good or bad for me.

954
02:15:17,509 --> 02:15:19,374
I will myself decide about it now.

955
02:15:32,924 --> 02:15:35,085
I'm sorry that I came away
without informing you.

956
02:15:35,327 --> 02:15:37,727
But what happened?
Are you upset with me?

957
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:39,794
No, no. Nothing of the sort.

958
02:15:40,632 --> 02:15:42,827
But I want to meet you tomorrow
and tell you something.

959
02:15:43,869 --> 02:15:45,393
I too want to tell you
a lot tomorrow.

960
02:15:47,105 --> 02:15:50,233
Yes, about me.
My entire story.

961
02:16:08,293 --> 02:16:10,921
A gift for you, Mr. Rajesh.

962
02:16:13,965 --> 02:16:15,091
Mala's clothes?
- Yes.

963
02:16:15,467 --> 02:16:18,436
What does this mean?
- You'll be telling the truth...

964
02:16:18,637 --> 02:16:20,764
...about you to Kajal, aren't you?
Don't you open your mouth.

965
02:16:22,874 --> 02:16:25,172
Who's responsible for this?
- Saudagar Singh.

966
02:16:35,487 --> 02:16:37,284
What's the matter?

967
02:16:37,889 --> 02:16:39,948
I've just received news that my
daddy has fallen seriously sick.

968
02:16:40,325 --> 02:16:41,952
I will go and check up.
I will telephone you later.

969
02:17:04,783 --> 02:17:09,618
Come, come...
Come and eat some fruits.

970
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:14,219
What's the meaning of
this behaviour?

971
02:17:15,327 --> 02:17:19,696
Don't cross the limits.
You have dug your own grave.

972
02:17:21,099 --> 02:17:24,330
Where's my sister?
Or I will kill you.

973
02:17:46,324 --> 02:17:48,690
Saudagar Singh smuggler?

974
02:17:49,094 --> 02:17:54,225
Yes. The one with a reward of
50,000 for his arrest.

975
02:17:55,066 --> 02:17:56,533
And not for nothing.

976
02:17:57,035 --> 02:17:59,367
If you look at the list of
my activities...

977
02:17:59,571 --> 02:18:04,031
you will realise that you are
merely an ant for me...

978
02:18:04,342 --> 02:18:07,277
and I can crush you with
my shoes whenever I like.

979
02:18:07,646 --> 02:18:11,548
So you entered my life not to
help me, but to steal my diamonds.

980
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:14,048
You have lost those diamonds
long since, friend.

981
02:18:15,353 --> 02:18:18,550
Today you aren't the player,
but the viewer.

982
02:18:19,424 --> 02:18:23,292
Kishorilal and I are
playing the game.

983
02:18:24,596 --> 02:18:28,555
And if I lose this game,
you will be responsible for it.

984
02:18:30,068 --> 02:18:33,697
And your innocent sister Mala
will have to pay for it.

985
02:18:37,208 --> 02:18:40,405
Every pearl of the Mala (necklace)
Will be scattered.

986
02:18:46,451 --> 02:18:47,543
What do you want from me?

987
02:18:48,753 --> 02:18:51,586
You have to reach Polo Ground at
sharp 2 o'clock alongwith Kajal.

988
02:18:52,357 --> 02:18:54,791
Our pilot and helicopter will be
waiting for you there.

989
02:18:56,394 --> 02:18:58,589
We will cross the border
before you do.

990
02:18:59,164 --> 02:19:01,098
And when you reach there
with Kajal...

991
02:19:01,299 --> 02:19:05,201
your sister Mala will be released.
- What about Kajal?

992
02:19:05,637 --> 02:19:08,538
After we get the diamonds,
you can take away Kajal too.

993
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:10,938
All right.

994
02:19:11,576 --> 02:19:14,443
Send these clothes to Mala rightaway.

995
02:19:36,968 --> 02:19:38,697
I want to speak to Kajal.

996
02:19:47,178 --> 02:19:50,341
There's some problem in my car.
Can you drop me a little ahead.

997
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:55,645
What's there in your bag?
- Nothing. Sweetmeats for children.

998
02:19:56,054 --> 02:19:57,851
Sit.

999
02:19:59,657 --> 02:20:01,181
Just a minute, sir.
Let me get some cigarettes.

1000
02:20:01,393 --> 02:20:02,724
All right. Hurry up.

1001
02:20:02,927 --> 02:20:04,656
Give me a pack, please.

1002
02:20:12,303 --> 02:20:14,931
He said that there are
sweetmeats in the bag.

1003
02:20:15,173 --> 02:20:17,164
But there are girl's clothes in it.

1004
02:20:22,547 --> 02:20:23,844
What happened?

1005
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:26,175
I had seen that girl
wearing this coat.

1006
02:20:26,384 --> 02:20:28,511
Which girl?
- Manjeet's sister Mala.

1007
02:20:32,056 --> 02:20:33,683
Keep it. He's back.

1008
02:20:51,576 --> 02:20:55,376
All right, sir. Thanks a lot.

1009
02:22:01,079 --> 02:22:05,948
Could it be that Rajesh has got to
know that Mala has slipped away?

1010
02:22:08,219 --> 02:22:12,451
When we got to know that some people
helped Mala escape...

1011
02:22:12,657 --> 02:22:15,387
by that time, Rajesh was already
on his way to meet Kajal.

1012
02:22:37,849 --> 02:22:39,817
Come on, Kajal.
- But where?

1013
02:23:02,273 --> 02:23:05,834
Why didn't you tell me that you are
bringing me to your father?

1014
02:23:07,145 --> 02:23:08,840
Greetings, Uncle.

1015
02:23:11,516 --> 02:23:13,780
The promise made to you has
been fulfilled.

1016
02:23:14,619 --> 02:23:15,847
Where's my sister Mala?

1017
02:23:16,054 --> 02:23:20,514
Dear, as soon as you left
Nainital with Kajal...

1018
02:23:20,725 --> 02:23:22,454
my men released your sister.

1019
02:23:23,294 --> 02:23:26,661
If this isn't Nainital,
where've you brought me, Manjeet?

1020
02:23:27,031 --> 02:23:28,362
Let me tell you.

1021
02:23:28,633 --> 02:23:31,466
Neither is he Manjeet,
nor is he his son.

1022
02:23:31,903 --> 02:23:35,464
His name is Rajesh, and
he had only one responsibility.

1023
02:23:36,074 --> 02:23:39,373
To get you out of the Indian borders.
- What for?

1024
02:23:40,244 --> 02:23:42,872
Your father possesses diamonds
worth 250 million rupees...

1025
02:23:43,081 --> 02:23:44,480
which once belonged to Rajesh.

1026
02:23:44,749 --> 02:23:47,877
Those diamonds will be the
price for your return.

1027
02:23:53,825 --> 02:23:55,554
For how long will Kajal
have to stay here?

1028
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:58,888
The news of Kajal being brought
here has reached Kishorilal.

1029
02:23:59,797 --> 02:24:02,288
He will come here tomorrow with the
diamonds in the helicopter...

1030
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:04,900
and then all of you
will be sent back.

1031
02:24:05,336 --> 02:24:09,397
I won't wait till tomorrow.
I know how to fly a helicopter.

1032
02:24:09,774 --> 02:24:11,708
I will go on my own and
come back with the diamonds.

1033
02:24:13,111 --> 02:24:14,908
I agree.

1034
02:24:15,113 --> 02:24:17,581
Till I return, Kajal will be
my asset in your custody.

1035
02:24:18,149 --> 02:24:20,413
I won't spare alive whoever
causes harm to Kajal...

1036
02:24:20,618 --> 02:24:23,712
even if I've search every
nook and corner of the earth.

1037
02:24:33,364 --> 02:24:38,199
Don't look like this.
I am aware of my crimes.

1038
02:24:38,803 --> 02:24:43,172
I committed a crime for which
I'm being punished today.

1039
02:24:44,809 --> 02:24:47,937
Neither would Sanjay's love
was auctioned off...

1040
02:24:48,146 --> 02:24:51,547
nor would I've been sold off
for your sister.

1041
02:24:53,251 --> 02:24:54,946
Whatever you say is right.

1042
02:24:55,586 --> 02:25:00,614
Just remember... either I will take
you away alive from here...

1043
02:25:00,825 --> 02:25:02,622
or my corpse will be
cremated right here.

1044
02:25:14,005 --> 02:25:15,632
Brother!

1045
02:25:18,543 --> 02:25:20,135
O brother!

1046
02:25:21,512 --> 02:25:23,207
How come you are here?

1047
02:25:23,414 --> 02:25:27,851
Yes, Sanjay rescued me from those
crooks and brought me here.

1048
02:25:28,286 --> 02:25:29,981
Sanjay?
- Yes.

1049
02:25:36,894 --> 02:25:41,991
Sanjay, my friend. The obligation
that you've done on me...

1050
02:25:42,633 --> 02:25:44,658
In return, even if you ask for
my life, I won't refuse.

1051
02:25:47,105 --> 02:25:48,663
Tell me, where's my daughter?

1052
02:25:50,541 --> 02:25:52,600
Shoot.

1053
02:25:54,178 --> 02:25:56,738
Cowards don't shoot bullets,
Kishorilal.

1054
02:25:57,582 --> 02:26:00,016
Only those who know how to give
up their life can take other's life.

1055
02:26:01,252 --> 02:26:05,689
Look into my eyes. I know
how to give and take life.

1056
02:26:06,290 --> 02:26:08,019
Tell me, where are
those diamonds...

1057
02:26:08,226 --> 02:26:10,251
which my father gave you while
dying to be given to me?

1058
02:26:10,461 --> 02:26:13,862
Yes, to me. My name is Rajesh.
And I want the diamonds...

1059
02:26:14,065 --> 02:26:17,523
not for myself, nor for my sister,
but to save Kajal's life.

1060
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:20,033
But I don't have those diamonds.
- You are lying!

1061
02:26:20,238 --> 02:26:24,334
Believe me, Rajesh.
Your dad did give me the diamonds.

1062
02:26:24,675 --> 02:26:27,508
But I don't know how some crooks
were aware about those diamonds.

1063
02:26:27,745 --> 02:26:30,009
And they followed me to India.

1064
02:26:30,414 --> 02:26:32,041
While escaping, I hid the belt
containing the diamonds...

1065
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:34,047
in a tool-box of a bicycle.

1066
02:26:34,385 --> 02:26:37,718
While I was hiding, somebody came
and took the bicycle away.

1067
02:26:38,089 --> 02:26:40,250
And you didn't even look
at the person, didn't you?

1068
02:26:40,458 --> 02:26:44,554
No, but I remember clearly that
it was a black-coloured tool-box...

1069
02:26:44,762 --> 02:26:48,220
and only two letters were
written on it... S and K.

1070
02:26:49,801 --> 02:26:51,393
Believe me, Rajesh.

1071
02:26:51,636 --> 02:26:57,905
Don't test my patience. I am enraged.
I might even murder you.

1072
02:26:58,109 --> 02:27:02,011
Are those diamonds more dear
to me than Kajal's life?

1073
02:27:02,713 --> 02:27:06,479
I take Kajal's oath and state that
I don't have those diamonds.

1074
02:27:06,818 --> 02:27:08,683
Those diamonds are with me.

1075
02:27:26,037 --> 02:27:27,766
These diamonds were
with you, Sanjay?

1076
02:27:28,339 --> 02:27:30,830
Yes.
- And you didn't even know?

1077
02:27:31,742 --> 02:27:33,107
No.

1078
02:27:34,979 --> 02:27:36,446
Know the price of these diamonds?

1079
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:42,611
If these diamonds can buy Kajal's
life, then they're priceless.

1080
02:27:43,654 --> 02:27:44,621
Else, they're mere stones.

1081
02:27:47,558 --> 02:27:50,049
I will go with these diamonds,
and bring back Kajal.

1082
02:27:50,294 --> 02:27:52,785
Are you confident that after
taking these diamonds...

1083
02:27:52,997 --> 02:27:54,521
they will let both
of you come back?

1084
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,868
No, I am not confident.
- Then I will accompany you.

1085
02:28:01,339 --> 02:28:03,807
The combat is very difficult,
my friend.

1086
02:28:04,075 --> 02:28:08,307
But if you are with me,
we are no less than anybody else.

1087
02:29:30,261 --> 02:29:32,229
Are they all of them?
- You may count them.

1088
02:29:32,463 --> 02:29:35,159
I trust you completely.
- But I don't.

1089
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:40,637
Your job is complete, Saudagar. You
will be paid your labour charges.

1090
02:29:48,679 --> 02:29:50,237
Remember what I had said?

1091
02:29:50,948 --> 02:29:55,544
After getting the diamonds, this
rascal will become a scoundrel.

1092
02:29:56,520 --> 02:30:00,854
Remove your hand from the revolver.
Else, you will be gunned down.

1093
02:30:01,192 --> 02:30:02,659
Look there!

1094
02:30:07,965 --> 02:30:10,092
Till yesterday, this den and this
businese belonged to you.

1095
02:30:11,202 --> 02:30:14,433
All these people were yours.
Not anymore.

1096
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,339
I've paid them the price
for their friendship.

1097
02:30:25,516 --> 02:30:28,952
It's my principle that I surely give
my enemy one chance to win.

1098
02:30:30,287 --> 02:30:32,687
I'm giving you too a chance.
- What do you mean?

1099
02:30:33,157 --> 02:30:38,117
Both of us will stand with
our backs to each other.

1100
02:30:39,497 --> 02:30:42,898
After walking for 15 steps,
we will fire at each other.

1101
02:30:44,135 --> 02:30:46,968
Whoever survives will get
these diamonds.

1102
02:32:01,679 --> 02:32:02,976
You had promised that after
getting the diamonds...

1103
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:05,375
you will have me and Kajal
sent back through the helicopter.

1104
02:32:06,016 --> 02:32:08,211
I will surely have you sent back,
but a little while later.

1105
02:32:08,819 --> 02:32:11,720
The helicopter will drop us
to a place and come back.

1106
02:32:45,523 --> 02:32:46,922
Move!
- Where?

1107
02:32:47,124 --> 02:32:49,820
Over there. Come on!
Move!

1108
02:34:56,954 --> 02:34:58,945
One of their associates
attacked us suddenly...

1109
02:34:59,156 --> 02:35:01,556
and they ran away on horses.
- This belt is a fake.

1110
02:35:01,859 --> 02:35:03,952
He cheated us and took the
real diamonds with him.

1111
02:35:04,161 --> 02:35:06,959
Now we have to stop them before
they reaches the Indian border.

1112
02:35:07,464 --> 02:35:10,399
Go and chase them in the jungles.
I will follow in the helicopter.

1113
02:37:08,585 --> 02:37:11,019
You come with me.
I will drop you further ahead.

1114
02:37:31,875 --> 02:37:33,706
Be on your guard, Sanjay.
I will be back.

1115
02:37:41,151 --> 02:37:47,454
I treated you so badly. Still, you
came to rescue me risking your life.

1116
02:37:47,991 --> 02:37:50,118
Rajesh too has risked his life.

1117
02:38:14,017 --> 02:38:16,144
The horses are gone!

1118
02:38:22,559 --> 02:38:24,083
Give me the gun and
take Kajal away.

1119
02:38:24,294 --> 02:38:25,761
What?

1120
02:39:35,866 --> 02:39:39,427
What happened, Kajal?
- I can't walk any further.

1121
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:42,170
Both of you escape
and save your lives.

1122
02:39:45,008 --> 02:39:48,569
The border is at a little distance.
Gather some more courage.

1123
02:40:04,895 --> 02:40:07,022
What's that?

1124
02:40:07,998 --> 02:40:10,262
That's the Indian border and
that's the Indian police post.

1125
02:40:17,074 --> 02:40:21,067
Wait here, Kajal.
Sanjay, you go from the front.

1126
02:40:22,846 --> 02:40:25,713
I will reach there from behind
hiding through the jungles.

1127
02:41:17,501 --> 02:41:18,934
Where's the belt
with the diamonds?

1128
02:41:20,037 --> 02:41:21,937
Where's the belt
with the diamonds?

1129
02:41:23,173 --> 02:41:25,937
With Rajesh and Kajal.
- Where are they?

1130
02:41:26,777 --> 02:41:28,438
Answer me, or I will blow you apart.

1131
02:41:29,846 --> 02:41:32,110
Over there. In the jungle.
- Move.

1132
02:41:46,997 --> 02:41:48,794
Do you have any gun?
- They've taken it away.

1133
02:41:48,999 --> 02:41:50,626
They have damaged the
wireless set too.

1134
02:41:50,834 --> 02:41:53,359
I will repair it and seek
help from the headquarters.

1135
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:14,149
Jack, I will go into the
jungles with them.

1136
02:42:14,958 --> 02:42:16,983
Go near the helicopter
with your men.

1137
02:44:56,887 --> 02:45:00,323
3 bullets... 3 enemies.

1138
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:06,654
One last bullet...
one last enemy.

1139
02:45:51,107 --> 02:45:56,044
Bring the helicopter down.
Or I will blow her head.

1140
02:46:11,761 --> 02:46:18,963
Rajesh, don't try to fool me.
Kajal's life is in your hands now.

1141
02:46:19,536 --> 02:46:23,097
I'm prepared to give you
the diamonds. Release Kajal.

1142
02:46:24,107 --> 02:46:25,699
The diamonds first.

1143
02:46:39,055 --> 02:46:42,752
I've one last bullet left.
Come forward.

1144
02:46:43,159 --> 02:46:44,990
No, don't come forward.

1145
02:46:45,195 --> 02:46:47,595
He has killed Sanjay.
He will kill you too.

1146
02:46:49,199 --> 02:46:54,068
I had spared you once. I can't repeat
the same mistake. Come forward.

1147
02:46:55,005 --> 02:46:57,200
Come forward, or
I will shoot Kajal.

1148
02:46:58,308 --> 02:47:04,110
No, Rajesh. Don't come forward.
Let me die.

1149
02:47:06,082 --> 02:47:07,606
Come forward.

1150
02:47:11,521 --> 02:47:13,284
No, no!

1151
02:47:32,409 --> 02:47:35,708
Nothing will happen to you, Sanjay.

1152
02:47:44,821 --> 02:47:47,813
Rajesh has sent this
letter for you, Kajal.

1153
02:47:49,959 --> 02:47:53,827
'Kajal, I am going to Delhi
for Mala's marriage... '

1154
02:47:54,030 --> 02:47:56,590
'and then return to London.
Far away from you'

1155
02:47:57,100 --> 02:48:00,331
'Far away from you because your
heart beats for Sanjay'

1156
02:48:01,304 --> 02:48:06,071
'Sanjay too loves you just as
I loved somebody once'

1157
02:48:07,777 --> 02:48:09,335
'Believe me, my friend'

1158
02:48:09,846 --> 02:48:13,077
'Kajal was yours, she is yours,
and she will always be yours'

1159
02:48:18,455 --> 02:48:20,184
Stop the car.

1160
02:48:33,036 --> 02:48:35,766
You'd got married, hadn't you?
- She wasn't married, dear.

1161
02:48:36,406 --> 02:48:39,102
She escaped on the wedding night
and came straight to me.

1162
02:48:39,676 --> 02:48:42,201
And then?
- The moment we got the chance...

1163
02:48:42,412 --> 02:48:44,380
we came from London to Delhi,
and from Delhi to this place.

1164
02:49:16,045 --> 02:49:17,410
What do you say now?

1165
02:49:17,614 --> 02:49:20,105
I agree that now both our
pairs are beyond compare.

1166
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:24,251
But we are no less
than anybody.
