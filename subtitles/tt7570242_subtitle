1
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,167
<i>You’re so right.</i>

2
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:46,875
<i>Life is nothing but arrivals,
departures and explorations.</i>

3
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,625
It must have been inconvenient for you
to come at such a short notice.

4
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,667
Getting leaves all of a sudden
is difficult, you know.

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,583
That's true.

6
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,167
It's impossible to take sudden leaves
at such a short notice in the US.

7
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,125
How did you manage to do so?

8
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,917
I had to put up an urgent request.

9
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,583
Just leave it there.
He’ll take care of it.

10
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,167
Hey, you don't need to do that. Take this.

11
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,250
Please stop thanking me.

12
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,208
Okay, then. I should take my leave now.

13
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,375
I'll call you in the evening.

14
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,500
<i>Please don’t...</i>

15
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,792
Where is he?

16
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,708
He's in the veranda.

17
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:41,208
He’s been calling out a new name
since yesterday.

18
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,750
Mayurakshi.

19
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,458
Do you know who that is?

20
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,542
What has he been saying?

21
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,792
He's been asking for her.

22
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,250
<i>When I lose even a jot of my possession</i>

23
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:16,167
<i>I lose all I have</i>

24
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,875
<i>I live with a little possession</i>

25
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:26,458
<i>So with a little loss, I lose it all</i>

26
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,958
<i>I desperately cling on</i>

27
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:44,667
<i>To the tides like a riverbank</i>

28
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,083
<i>I desperately cling on</i>

29
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:55,667
<i>To the tides like a riverbank</i>

30
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,458
<i>Where do the waves disappear</i>

31
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:07,417
<i>After having lashed at my heart
One after the other?</i>

32
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,333
<i>I live with a little possession</i>

33
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:15,042
<i>So with a little loss, I lose it all...</i>

34
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,333
How are you?

35
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,125
<i>If I offer you all that I lose
And all that remains...</i>

36
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,667
When did you arrive?

37
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,250
Just now. I came right to you.

38
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,083
<i>If I offer you all that I lose
And all that remains</i>

39
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,750
<i>Nothing degenerates</i>

40
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,875
<i>But it remains ever wakeful</i>

41
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:46,375
<i>In your supreme benediction</i>

42
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:52,958
<i>In you, exist numerous moons and suns</i>

43
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,917
<i>And even the tiniest of atoms...</i>

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,917
This place is warmer than Delhi.

45
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,875
Lucknow?

46
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,875
Why are you sitting like that?

47
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,542
You did get some sleep, didn't you?

48
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,458
Talk to him, okay?

49
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,458
-Please sit.
-Is he unwell?

50
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:19,792
No.

51
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:26,667
<i>I live with a little possession</i>

52
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:31,375
<i>So with a little loss, I lose it all</i>

53
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,458
What's with the beard?

54
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,875
I grew it on purpose.

55
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:42,958
Don’t you like it?

56
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,708
Sir, your coffee.

57
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,458
Hey, get the tea.

58
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,792
Will you be staying downstairs, sir?

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,833
Then I must get the room upstairs ready.

60
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:19,042
How long has he gone quiet?

61
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,750
He talks all right.

62
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,583
He's not always that mum.

63
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,833
Let me bring him here.

64
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,125
I’ll get the room cleaned up.

65
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,917
In the meantime,
please rest in another room.

66
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,708
Hey, come with me.

67
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,500
I’m going up with the keys.

68
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,708
You never doze off in the morning.

69
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,667
What’s wrong with you today?

70
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:53,500
There you are.

71
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:02,542
-It’s been the hottest summer in the US.
-Eat something.

72
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,958
When I was
on a Spring Boat tour last month,

73
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,917
I could hardly sit on the deck
because of the heat.

74
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,042
The strategy is all wrong.

75
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:23,542
They should’ve sent you one down.

76
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,083
How could they send a player
who can’t play medium pace

77
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,833
on that slippery pitch in the third over?

78
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,792
I don't know what the coach was thinking.

79
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,583
And your beard is just horrible!

80
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:41,583
I’ll get rid of it.

81
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:45,208
Your mom would be really upset
to see you like this.

82
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,208
But then,

83
00:09:56,417 --> 00:10:00,417
your mom is already dead.

84
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,042
When did she pass away?

85
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,583
Or 1997?

86
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,917
It’s almost done. I’ll email it to you.

87
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,083
Does he still read?

88
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,125
Hardly.

89
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,667
Sometimes he'd pick a book,

90
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,458
but can’t concentrate.

91
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,917
He doesn’t even read the newspaper.

92
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,042
And he gets angry if coaxed.

93
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,583
"Worthless news.

94
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,750
I won’t read it."

95
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,542
No.

96
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,875
He gets irritated by it.

97
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,667
He used to at least watch sports.

98
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,625
Now I only I put on
the FM Radio in the morning.

99
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,958
He likes that.

100
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,875
His tummy is quite bloated.

101
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,958
That’s flatulence.

102
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,125
He’s taking antacids in the morning.

103
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,833
-It’ll be all right.
-Sir.

104
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,250
Please freshen up.

105
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,958
You’ve been on the plane for so long.

106
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,292
You don’t talk to him, am I right?

107
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,542
I believe his condition
is due to acute loneliness.

108
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,792
He's an elderly man.
If nobody talks to him,

109
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,583
or interacts with him,
he’s sure to have mental problems.

110
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,417
He used to talk to us.

111
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,333
Ravi can vouch for that.

112
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,708
He insisted on narrating
a whole novel for us in a single sitting.

113
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,167
Yes. Right now, he wouldn’t even eat.

114
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,500
And he'll get mad at us
if we told him something.

115
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,542
He would say,
"I’ll finish the story, then I'll eat."

116
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,750
Now he has become somewhat different.

117
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,833
You saw how
he didn’t speak with you at first.

118
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,083
And then...

119
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,292
Have a seat.

120
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,875
I have something for you.

121
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,583
You can go upstairs when you’re done here.
The room is ready.

122
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,542
Is it your neck pain again?

123
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,292
Should I get you the hot water bag?

124
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:42,417
It has a light.

125
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,833
It's a macro lens for reading
small letters. Here.

126
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,667
These letters are so small.
Don’t you have difficulty reading these?

127
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,667
Stop reading the newspaper.

128
00:13:56,917 --> 00:14:01,417
It's all about violence,
intolerance and mutual hatred.

129
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,917
Why should I spend money
reading all these?

130
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,833
Do you know what I think?

131
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,083
Broken brick piece.

132
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,625
He got it from the pots in the balcony.

133
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,083
Who said this?

134
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,208
Gladstone.

135
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,667
William Ewart Gladstone.

136
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,458
Can I see Dr. Ranjit Basu?

137
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,875
I was in the Bengal Ranji Trophy team.

138
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,125
I've played in Lucknow.

139
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,708
We lost to Delhi by 87 runs.

140
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,833
So, I called up my dad that night
and told him everything.

141
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,625
I gave him all the intricate details.

142
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,792
That was what he insisted on.

143
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,667
We sent in Salil Ray as a nightwatchman...

144
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:15,917
So, your visit from Chicago is actually,
your return from Lucknow for him?

145
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,375
That’s what it seems now.

146
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,792
When did your mom pass away?

147
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,583
It was 18 years ago.

148
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,875
-Do you have any siblings?
-No.

149
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,750
I’m the only and a late child.

150
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,792
So, was your dad absolutely alone?

151
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,083
No. There's someone with him
since the last two years.

152
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:49,458
A housekeeper.
But she has geriatric support experience.

153
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,375
What if he has
to use the bathroom? Bathing?

154
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,458
Generally, he does that all by himself.

155
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,833
He doesn’t go out alone.

156
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,542
But he fell a couple of times.

157
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,625
And he doesn't like

158
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,000
my beard at all.

159
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,708
Did you have it before?

160
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,875
Never.

161
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:18,542
I had a rash, so...

162
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,083
But that’s cured, right?

163
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,625
How old is your dad? Is he 84 years old?

164
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,250
May I come in?

165
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,667
Let's keep both of them on.

166
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,083
Mosquitoes are a bother.

167
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:49,500
What about pest control?

168
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,000
It works only for a while.
Then it’s back to square one.

169
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,333
Is the air conditioner working?

170
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:55,750
Yes.

171
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,208
Just checking.
It hasn't been used for a while.

172
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:48,917
Do you like it?

173
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,625
This piece is called <i>The Human Mind</i>.

174
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,042
It's a colleague,
Daniel Gordy’s composition.

175
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:05,500
The book needs to be returned
to the library.

176
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,875
Check the due date.

177
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,375
What book?

178
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,083
I don’t know.

179
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,917
Our transition through

180
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:26,042
British colonialism to Independence

181
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,583
-and partition...
-Get him the cottage cheese.

182
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,125
A child was born in this phase.

183
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,375
It was in 1947,

184
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,625
August 14

185
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,167
at midnight.

186
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,208
Take all of this away! I don’t like it.

187
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,458
Remove all of them.
I don't feel like eating.

188
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,042
But you like cottage cheese, don’t you?

189
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,708
I won’t eat today.

190
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,625
Are you talking about <i>Midnight’s Children</i>?

191
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,167
Do you mean if I've read it?

192
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,875
Yes. She must have lent it to you.

193
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,458
Will you ask Mayurakshi to drop by

194
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,542
on her way back
from the university tomorrow?

195
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:15,458
Sir, please have some of it.

196
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:19,708
Please don’t bother me.
And don’t even try to force me.

197
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,667
-Or I’ll stop eating!
-All right. Let it be. Clear the plates.

198
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
The child

199
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,125
had astonishing powers.

200
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,167
He can see the future.

201
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,292
It's true, you know.

202
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,333
My dad

203
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,500
wasn’t told that his sister was dead.

204
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,750
Or that's what people thought.

205
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,042
Why would anyone tell bad news
to an old man?

206
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:12,167
But Dad could sense it all.

207
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,542
He told me

208
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,417
a detailed description
of his sister’s death.

209
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:24,958
That's what happened.

210
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,625
<i>It's just a wee bit small.</i>

211
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,417
<i>I didn’t know that you would bring this.</i>

212
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,417
I’ve got other gifts for you too.

213
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,417
So, I won't give that to you. Okay?

214
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:45,083
<i>Oh, what else? Okay, let it be a surprise.</i>

215
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,750
<i>Will you be coming tomorrow
or on Thursday?</i>

216
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,542
Your mom will go tomorrow.
I'll come by in a few days after.

217
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,750
<i>Please come during the weekend.</i>

218
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,292
<i>I have two exams next week.</i>

219
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,292
Okay.

220
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,667
It’s late, go to sleep.

221
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,500
<i>It’s only 11, Dad.</i>

222
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,083
<i>During exams time,
I’m usually awake until 12 a.m.</i>

223
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,083
<i>This is a gift from Mom.</i>

224
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,667
Has he put on the mosquito repellant
in your room?

225
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,667
He was groaning in his sleep
a few days ago.

226
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,458
I'm keeping an eye. If it recurs,
we should let the doctor know.

227
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,625
But Dr. Sengupta is dead.

228
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes. So now, we should consult Dr. Roy.

229
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,417
Since you have to look after him,
you may sleep in his room.

230
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,542
Ravi can sleep there.

231
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,500
No one has told him
about Dr. Sengupta death.

232
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,500
Why?

233
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,292
He won’t be able to take it.

234
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,792
They had been friends for ages.

235
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,958
Just tell him.
How long do you plan to hide it?

236
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,750
There's no use of telling bad news
to an old man.

237
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,417
I told him that the doctor
has left for Delhi.

238
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,917
<i>Such moments strike a chord in our mind.</i>

239
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:13,083
<i>Moments lie hidden
in the little corners of our mind.</i>

240
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,250
<i>It is those moments that we seek.</i>

241
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,167
<i>Just like the track of time that we lose
or a person we lose,</i>

242
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:22,375
<i>or our sensitivity.</i>

243
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,625
<i>Perhaps it was the moment we had</i>

244
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:28,042
<i>that was once precious to us.</i>

245
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:33,125
<i> Those memories
that have nearly faded away</i>

246
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:38,167
<i>are what we seek to explore today.</i>

247
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,417
<i>It could be something precious to you...</i>

248
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:48,500
<i>...call me and share it with me.</i>

249
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,000
Leave it to me.

250
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,833
That fish monger is something.
He never turns up on time.

251
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:10,875
<i>Nothing is ever lost in your universe...</i>

252
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:11,958
Lift your chin.

253
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,042
<i>O Lord!</i>

254
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:21,125
<i>We're fools, blinded by delusion</i>

255
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:26,458
<i>We're fools, blinded by delusion</i>

256
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:31,292
<i>We can only weep, O Lord!</i>

257
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,375
What are you doing these days?

258
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,792
Why? The things I used to do.

259
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,625
You were so good

260
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,250
in explaining cloud computing to people.

261
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,875
Let’s see if you can recall what you knew.

262
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,333
You are sad.

263
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:03,292
It isn’t insanity, right?

264
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,333
That’s what I fear the most.

265
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,792
It’s very common, you know.

266
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,792
He's living in the past.

267
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,458
A friend of mine's dad,
who passed away last year,

268
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,583
suddenly told him
to not go anywhere one day.

269
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,417
So, my friend asked, "Do you need me?"

270
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,375
He replied, "No. It’s my wedding tomorrow.

271
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:36,083
You need to be around.
Or else, who’ll help me?"

272
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,625
Imagine that.

273
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,583
Can you pull up on the left?

274
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,750
-Here?
-To the left, please.

275
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,750
Hari, please stop the car.

276
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,542
Don’t mention it.

277
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,292
I’ll call you in the evening.

278
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,250
Where's the way to house number six?

279
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,000
-Go straight down and turn left.
-That way?

280
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,542
Bibhas Dutta?

281
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,458
-You must be Aryanil.
-Yes.

282
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,417
Please come in. My brother
told me about you yesterday. Come in.

283
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:03,542
This way, please.

284
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,833
You could have mailed it to me.

285
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,042
You don't have to be bothered.

286
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,917
My brother works with you, right?
Please sit.

287
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,917
So, how can I help you?

288
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,167
I heard that there are many layoffs.

289
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,125
Things are in doldrums here.

290
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:33,750
The owners are in jail

291
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:37,208
and we agents have become paupers.

292
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:41,292
Didn’t this chit fund business
begin in the US?

293
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,583
What was that man’s name? Charles Ponzi?

294
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,875
-I've got to push off and get to work.
-No, wait.

295
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,125
Please, let me look at it.

296
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,875
It won't work.
Do you have a knife or scissors?

297
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,500
Let me check.

298
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,417
-Will this be of any help?
-No need, I got this.

299
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:22,583
Well, it's an American system after all.

300
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,375
You have to know the trick.

301
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,333
Here.

302
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,208
Please have a seat.

303
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,750
I wonder why he sent these things.

304
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,417
What a waste of money.

305
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,250
These bank transfers are a bother.

306
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,792
We have to show this receipt to the bank

307
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,250
and only then will they transfer the cash.

308
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,125
Would you like some tea?

309
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,208
He's your uncle’s boss.
Go get some tea, quick.

310
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,417
No, not now.

311
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,042
Well, isn’t your dad alone here?

312
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,750
Who looks after him?

313
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:11,625
We have a housekeeper.

314
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:16,208
So, she manages the house,
money and everything else?

315
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,750
There are so many things
a housekeeper must do nowadays.

316
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,667
Yet, we're so ignorant.

317
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,083
Hey, leave those alone.

318
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:35,042
Is it possible
for you to find a job for her?

319
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:39,667
-Seek help from any agency--
-Hey, agency is nothing but pimping.

320
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:43,125
Then why don't you take her with you?
You live alone anyway.

321
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,667
She’ll do everything.

322
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,042
Being a dance teacher
won’t get her anywhere.

323
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,167
Her uncle isn't much of help.
And I know that too well.

324
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,958
What happened?

325
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,500
<i>Did you mind my words?</i>

326
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

327
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,083
<i>I'm really feeling low.</i>

328
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,083
<i>But how could you guess that, Dad?</i>

329
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,417
You looked just like Michael Douglas
from a distance! Come on.

330
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,917
But not anymore, right?

331
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,750
Up close, you look like my friend
from the eighth grade.

332
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,292
We had possibilities to be together,
but nothing worked out.

333
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,583
Okay, now sit.

334
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,625
What's with the beard?

335
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:13,000
So, do you think
this Michael Douglas is fuzzy?

336
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,708
What are you talking about?
Don't you know <i>King of California</i>?

337
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,792
You’re still the same.

338
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:22,417
Do you remember the noon show at Globe?
<i>Basic Instinct</i>?

339
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,542
I feel like I got etched right here.

340
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,167
Come on.

341
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:28,875
So, tell me.

342
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,792
Why are you here in such a short notice?

343
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,000
It's Dad.

344
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:36,417
What’s wrong with him?

345
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,500
I guess some sort of disorientation.
It appears to be neurological.

346
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,958
What a pity. He has a brilliant mind.

347
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:47,375
How old is he?

348
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,792
But that’s common for those at that age.

349
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,417
How are you?

350
00:33:57,292 --> 00:34:01,083
My daughter is in IIT Kanpur
and my husband is busy with his business.

351
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,708
So, I’m a free bird!

352
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,667
What about you? Are you dating anyone?

353
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:07,958
Are you kidding?

354
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:08,958
Not again.

355
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,042
You're sleeping with somebody, aren’t you?

356
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,083
Oh, stop it. What would you like to have?

357
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:17,250
You still blush at such things.

358
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,583
You’ll get it from me. Let's go.

359
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,083
Let's go.

360
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:24,708
Do you want to sit in the café?

361
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,958
How long will you be here?

362
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:30,917
I don’t know.

363
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,292
How’s your son?

364
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,292
He's fine.

365
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,167
Do you want to sit here? Sit.

366
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,333
Fusion music these days

367
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,250
is quite good.

368
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,458
But you only listen to orchestras.

369
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,792
Royal Philharmonic, National Symphony.

370
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,208
When did you hear fusion?

371
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,750
No, actually

372
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:44,833
she came one day

373
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:49,583
and it seemed like she's interested
in a wide variety of music.

374
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,625
She gave me a...

375
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:02,250
Yes.

376
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:04,917
Mayurakshi brought it.

377
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:11,458
The composer was a young lad.

378
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,792
And I also heard a few Tamil songs.

379
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,083
It was excellent.

380
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:25,875
A fusion of our classical music
and world music.

381
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
A. R. Rahman?

382
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,958
Listen, Nilu...

383
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,333
Sometimes I feel

384
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,542
that in certain moments of life,

385
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,750
you need background music.

386
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,792
Yes.

387
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:03,250
Just like the movies?

388
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,167
Look.

389
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:52,042
Dad, listen to me. Dad.

390
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,917
Very nice. That was wonderful.

391
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,667
Shall we order coffee now?

392
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,792
Here's the menu. So, what will you have?

393
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,667
Would you like hot coffee?

394
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,375
What was that?

395
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,458
I was just putting my violin aside.

396
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:24,167
I’ll have this one. This one right here.

397
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,667
Let me see.

398
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:36,667
May I come in?

399
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,792
These are the bills
for the last two months.

400
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,875
The doctor visits, medicines, groceries
and other expenses

401
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,417
are all mentioned in different pages.

402
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,208
Have you mailed this to me?

403
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,417
I have.

404
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,917
Please have a look at it
since you’re already at it.

405
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,417
Actually,

406
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:05,167
it'd be good to get
a full-time attendant for him now.

407
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:11,583
He can’t hold in his pee anymore
and he wetted his bed last few nights.

408
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,625
The maid refuses to wash his sheets.

409
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,333
Have you informed the doctor?

410
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,542
Yes. Many times.

411
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,583
He has prostate gland problem.

412
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,333
It's quite common for a man his age.

413
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:28,083
The damp sheets cause bedsores.

414
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,958
Just hire an attendant then.

415
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,167
Can your agency arrange for it?

416
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,250
No. There are other agencies
for attendants' services.

417
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,208
I'll give them a call.

418
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,000
If I may ask,

419
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:53,583
can I go home for a couple of days?

420
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:54,500
What for?

421
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,542
Who’s going to stay here then?

422
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,333
The attendant will come here tomorrow.

423
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,792
Besides, you’re here now.

424
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:03,833
I can’t stay for more than two days.

425
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,042
I’ll have to visit my son in Dehradun.

426
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:11,167
You can go back home some other day.

427
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:14,458
You have nothing urgent there, right?

428
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,875
My son’s exams begin next Monday.

429
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,708
I thought I could see him before that.

430
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,333
It’s all right.

431
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,917
I won’t hire a permanent attendant.

432
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,000
I’ll discontinue her service

433
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,667
once my dad gets better.

434
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:39,875
Okay.

435
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,500
Sir.

436
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:06,333
Please don't bolt the toilet door

437
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,667
from now on.

438
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:12,417
Okay?

439
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,167
Don’t worry too much.
It’s absolutely fine.

440
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,750
There’s a new coffee shop near the bank.

441
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:27,792
Please take him there.

442
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,708
Okay.

443
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,250
Do you like the Irish coffee
you had this evening?

444
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,625
I don’t know.

445
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:41,750
He’s forgotten.

446
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,292
Why would he? He just didn't hear me.

447
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:49,167
What coffee did you have
when we went out earlier?

448
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,125
You ordered it yourself from the menu.

449
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,583
I can’t remember.

450
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:58,958
Try to remember.

451
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,292
I know you can.

452
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,708
What’s the coffee called?

453
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,250
I’ll give you a clue.

454
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:12,875
It has a link
with a North Atlantic island--

455
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:15,042
I told you that I can’t remember!

456
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,667
I don’t like it.

457
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,917
I would've told you if I remembered it.

458
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,958
<i>It’s been drizzling since morning.</i>

459
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,375
<i>Normally, you would stand right here.</i>

460
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:10,125
Old TV, CPU, radio or clock
that anyone wants to sell?

461
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:18,458
Old TV, CPU, radio or clock
that anyone wants to sell?

462
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,167
Sir, do you have anything old to sell?

463
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:32,083
Old TV, CPU, radio or clock
that anyone wants to sell?

464
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,417
These are typical delusions.

465
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:42,750
The mind creates a world
that disconnects them from the reality.

466
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,167
Six months ago,

467
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:48,042
our house physician ran a few tests.

468
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,292
Yes, I checked.

469
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:55,458
There are several factors.

470
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,417
Some of those ailments

471
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:01,250
are common for those at his age.

472
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:06,542
He used to have hypertension
and cervical spondylosis.

473
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,208
But now
with the neurological dysfunctions,

474
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,667
confusion, depression and dementia...

475
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,875
All of them affect his judgment.

476
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,042
This way, please.

477
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:30,625
<i>And the path</i>

478
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,250
<i>Strewn with flowers</i>

479
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:41,000
<i>The spring had adorned itself
With millions of colors</i>

480
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:46,292
<i>And had descended on the earth</i>

481
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:51,708
<i>But there was no news</i>

482
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,750
<i>And I remained waiting</i>

483
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:54,667
Sir.

484
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,542
Why are you standing here?
Where do you want to go?

485
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,458
Where did you go?

486
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,458
I was right here.

487
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,417
Don’t just leave me.

488
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,333
Or I'll I get scared.

489
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,875
I won’t go anywhere. Come.

490
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:14,375
Come.

491
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,708
Should I switch off the radio?

492
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:22,750
No.

493
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,667
<i>The song is over.
But doesn’t it still linger in your head?</i>

494
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,625
Have a seat.

495
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:29,875
Should I get your tea here?

496
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,625
I'll get it.

497
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:41,083
<i>We feel the resonance in its many layers.</i>

498
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,375
He remembers incidents of 25 years ago

499
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,292
in great detail.

500
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,583
That would be photographic memories.

501
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:53,083
But he won’t be able
to recall today’s lunch menu.

502
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,458
Wasn’t he commenting about your beard?

503
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:57,917
Not anymore. He has forgotten about it.

504
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,792
His dad will be admitted.

505
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:08,167
Besides routine tests,
get MRI and EEG done.

506
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:10,958
And...

507
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:15,000
For psychometry...

508
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,833
Who’s the doctor

509
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,917
in the Geriatric Department?

510
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,583
Hey.

511
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,583
See, I forget things too.

512
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,958
What’s his name?

513
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:31,792
-Dr. Sabir?
-Right.

514
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,000
Get him admitted.

515
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:38,792
Give him your contact number.

516
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:42,333
Please coordinate with him.
He’ll arrange everything. Okay?

517
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,750
What a horrible phase.

518
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:57,083
A brilliant man like him,

519
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,167
getting disconnected

520
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,958
from everything.

521
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,917
Maybe one day,

522
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,125
everything will go blank.

523
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,958
Maybe he won’t even recognize me
on my next visit.

524
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,833
Will you take him with you?

525
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,708
Ravi, Mallika

526
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:40,083
and tomorrow's attendant...

527
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:42,500
With all of them there, I’ll go bankrupt.

528
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:47,750
He might feel unsettled in a new place.

529
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,708
Is Mallika a nurse?

530
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,125
From the agency?

531
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,667
So, she handles the money,
doctors and the rest.

532
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:08,750
May I ask you something?

533
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,583
Forget it.

534
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,250
My earning funds four establishments.

535
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:32,750
My dad here,

536
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,792
my son from my first marriage in Dehradun,

537
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,042
myself in Chicago,

538
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:45,125
and spousal support for my second divorce,

539
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:47,625
the alimony.

540
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:59,417
These can turn anyone speechless.

541
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:02,958
Your cell phone?

542
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,250
Oh, my.

543
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,708
Such a sweet boy.

544
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,833
How old is he?

545
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:26,208
He's 16.

546
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,750
The Doon School?

547
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:34,083
Does his mom visit him?

548
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,083
Yes.

549
00:49:37,042 --> 00:49:38,333
Did you meet her?

550
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,250
No. She’s been in Dubai.

551
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:42,958
It has been a few years.

552
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,375
And how do you discuss things
about your son?

553
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,750
Over the phone?

554
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:49,375
Mostly email.

555
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:53,500
We'll call each other if it's urgent.

556
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,000
I sometimes wonder.

557
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,042
How can a sensitive person like you

558
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,083
have two

559
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:15,458
failed marriages?

560
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:22,833
Who told you sensitivity
and marriage are related?

561
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:39,833
Lovely.

562
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,583
What a sweet child.

563
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,167
Hey.

564
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:51,583
Are you dozing off?

565
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,083
Get up. I’ll make some tea.

566
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:56,917
Get up!

567
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,583
Here’s your cell phone.
I’ll get the tea ready.

568
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:31,833
Sir, she is...

569
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,208
-What’s your name?
-Mili.

570
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,792
Mili. She's Mili.

571
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,833
Mili will stay with you
from tonight onwards, okay?

572
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:39,958
Please come here.

573
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:45,917
For now, just fold these clothes.
Later, I'll keep them in the wardrobe.

574
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,917
She’ll be right here with you.

575
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,500
I’ll call you for dinner soon.

576
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:51,083
Okay?

577
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,625
May I come in?

578
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:16,875
These are the doctor’s prescriptions
and reports.

579
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:19,125
I've arranged them date-wise.

580
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,542
He’ll be in the hospital for two days.

581
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,708
You may go back home then.

582
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,125
Okay.

583
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,083
How old is your son?

584
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,500
He's 11.

585
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:45,875
One moment, please.

586
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,250
Please give this to your son.

587
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,083
I brought it for my son.

588
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:01,833
I didn’t know that his mom
had already brought it for him. Here.

589
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:12,125
He’ll be so happy.
He loves watching birds.

590
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,083
Great, glad to hear that.

591
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,917
It has many functions.

592
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:20,083
You can read the manual
and explain it to him.

593
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,375
Okay.

594
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,625
I’m going to serve your dad his dinner.

595
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,375
Please have one chapati at least.

596
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:40,708
No.

597
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,667
What happened? Why won’t you eat?

598
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:47,417
I'm not hungry.

599
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,833
Just eat whatever you like.

600
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,833
Have something, Dad.

601
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:02,250
Are you sending me off somewhere?

602
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,458
What are you saying?

603
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,750
Didn’t I tell you?

604
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,208
They’ll just run a few tests.

605
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:12,083
You’ll be admitted tomorrow afternoon
and return home a day later.

606
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,542
Sir.

607
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:16,167
Should I fry some flatbread for you?

608
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,750
-Would you have it?
-No.

609
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,583
What are you looking for?

610
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:23,667
The keys are here.

611
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:27,958
Okay. Keep them with you.
I don't want to lose them.

612
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:33,125
Returned the key to my house.

613
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,583
Forfeited my right to the home.

614
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,958
To all, I bid...

615
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,708
To all, I bid...

616
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,125
To all, I bid goodbye.

617
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:55,417
Why are you talking gibberish?

618
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:57,625
This is not gibberish.

619
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:00,958
Here.

620
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,083
Eat up.

621
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:08,875
Now, look. What did I want to tell you?

622
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:14,750
I keep forgetting
because of all this fuss.

623
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:16,833
We’ll clear the room.

624
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:18,292
-Ravi?
-Yes, what is it?

625
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:19,750
-Tell me.
-Let's go out.

626
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,875
No.

627
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:23,625
Why won’t you eat?

628
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:25,292
Listen to me.

629
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:28,750
-Listen, sometimes...
-Hey, come with us too.

630
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:34,750
I tend to forget sometimes.

631
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,833
Are these tests because of that?

632
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,000
They're just routine tests, Dad.

633
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,708
Listen to me.

634
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:53,583
But now...

635
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,667
I only have you before me.

636
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,708
Nothing else remains.

637
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,583
Nothing.

638
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,208
Dad.

639
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:26,375
Can you really give somebody
an "additional memory"?

640
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:31,042
Those are merely tests
routinely done after a certain age.

641
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:34,625
Just a matter of one day, Dad.

642
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:39,333
The place where I am going...

643
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:42,875
Can you bring

644
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,125
her there too?

645
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,125
Who is she?

646
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,333
Mayurakshi.

647
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,417
Can you at least try?

648
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,750
I’ve been wanting to see her.

649
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,333
I’ve never asked for anything.

650
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,125
<i>I return home only for you.</i>

651
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,625
<i>And I don’t know
if I’ll recognize anything.</i>

652
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:33,542
<i>Mayurakshi Mukherjee
and Sushobhan Roy Chowdhury.</i>

653
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:50,083
Here’s another one, 1997.

654
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:54,917
But there is no address on the record.

655
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,208
Only the college address.

656
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,333
Did she stay in a hostel?

657
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:03,292
No. Her house was right
behind the college.

658
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:07,083
I went there looking for her,
but no one knows anything.

659
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:09,542
Well, it has been a long time.

660
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,667
Tracing her will be a little difficult.

661
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:14,458
How long did you stay here?

662
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:17,167
Six years.

663
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,833
-Did she live here then?
-Yes.

664
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:27,125
Actually, I am looking
for her current address.

665
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,583
Okay. I understand.

666
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:33,167
I still remember what your dad told me.

667
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:36,333
Especially if anyone was morose,
he would say,

668
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,500
"Times will change."

669
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,875
-This was perhaps <i>Gone With the Wind's</i>--
-The last line of it.

670
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:50,208
I think someone can give you a lead.

671
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:53,292
Our former librarian, Mr. Shashank.

672
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:54,750
Of course. I know him.

673
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:57,125
Good. Go to him then.

674
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:00,958
But he’s somewhat depressed.

675
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,083
<i>They killed his granddaughter</i>

676
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,667
<i>because she got involved
in a political mess.</i>

677
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,417
<i>She was shot dead in the market
at 10 in the morning.</i>

678
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,292
<i>I don’t know where will this get us.</i>

679
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,958
Mayurakshi.

680
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,625
The river has such crystal clear water

681
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:29,917
that you can see
right to the bottom of it.

682
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:35,125
But it is horrific when it rains.

683
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:38,208
It floods its banks

684
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:41,333
and sweeps everything away.

685
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:46,875
She was...

686
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:49,917
She was such a nice girl.

687
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,792
Calm and well-mannered.

688
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,833
She had nobody but her mom.

689
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,583
When her mom passed away,

690
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:06,917
Mayurakshi too left for Kolkata
to look for a job.

691
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,917
I wonder where she is now.

692
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,458
How is she doing?

693
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:51,167
I’ll be off, then.

694
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:54,417
-Please come on time tomorrow.
-Sure.

695
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:57,417
These are his watch and keys.

696
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:09,292
-Let's go.
-I don’t like sitting like this.

697
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:10,917
Can I walk?

698
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,958
Get up.

699
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,500
Please take this off.

700
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,083
Get up.

701
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:23,167
We won’t be needing that.

702
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,125
Lovely.

703
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,000
What a beautiful view.

704
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:43,667
Aparna...

705
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,125
was terribly scared of hospitals.

706
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,917
I never got her admitted.

707
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:59,833
Mom spent the last three months
of her life in a hospital.

708
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,958
No.

709
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:09,958
I've never managed to get her admitted.

710
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:12,292
May I come in?

711
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:14,625
Please.

712
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,833
Can you tell them

713
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:30,875
not to close the curtains at night.

714
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,292
Otherwise,
there'll be no light around here.

715
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:38,792
I’ll tell them that.

716
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,500
Is your Dad going mad?

717
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,917
Who’s saying all this rubbish?

718
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:12,958
Everyone.

719
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:15,833
After this he’ll get violent, shout

720
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:18,500
and roam the streets naked.

721
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:22,542
Just get rid of the attendant already.

722
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,625
Why?

723
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,500
She said stupid things. I don’t like it.

724
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:32,708
Don’t hire any more strange people.

725
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,500
<i>"Even after knowing the address</i>

726
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:12,958
<i>one has to seek a direction."</i>

727
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:16,208
<i>You would say that so casually.</i>

728
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,083
He’s fine.

729
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:43,417
Did he recognize you?

730
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:46,542
I think he did. He smiled.

731
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:50,208
He is still so regal.

732
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,208
What if one day,

733
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,042
just like him,

734
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:08,375
we'll get lost in the maze
of our past memories?

735
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:16,667
What are you thinking about?

736
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:22,958
What if you go back by 25 years
and I move 25 years ahead?

737
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,792
Shut up!

738
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,208
You’re too much.

739
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,542
No wonder you’re like this.

740
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:30,833
-Who?
-You. Who else?

741
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,167
With a self-centered daughter like mine,

742
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:37,708
I’m sure to be thrown out.

743
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:40,500
She’ll say, "Mom’s gone crazy."

744
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:45,667
And my husband will give up
even way before that.

745
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:49,708
He'll say, "She’s gone crazy.
Her treatment would be a bad investment."

746
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,958
He is a businessman, after all.

747
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:53,917
What are you up to now?

748
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:56,292
Camping here like this?
Don’t you have to return?

749
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:01,625
-The office called thrice yesterday.
-What?

750
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:03,750
The annual convention is coming up.

751
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:07,667
You have no choice but to go back then.

752
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,250
We’re all here.

753
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,875
Your cousin and what’s her name...

754
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:13,083
-Mallika.
-Mallika.

755
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:16,167
Give me their numbers. I’ll keep in touch.

756
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:18,458
Let’s see if the doctor’s here. Let's go.

757
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,250
Do you remember Mayurakshi?

758
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,875
Mayurakshi...

759
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:36,000
-You mean your Dad's...
-His student at Serampore College.

760
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:40,083
Yes. He was hell-bent
on getting you two married.

761
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,792
He is looking for her, desperately.

762
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:45,917
Oh, God. Why?

763
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,833
Sushovan Roychowdhury?

764
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,542
Just a minute, I'll be back.

765
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,583
Sir, Dr. Bose is asking for you.

766
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,042
-This way, please.
-I'll be back.

767
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,000
Okay.

768
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,167
Your dad...

769
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:05,500
I chatted for a full hour
with him yesterday.

770
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:14,083
I asked him everything
from R. D. Burman to Ramchandra Guha.

771
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:20,625
He didn’t have a grip on his memory
and often confused.

772
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:26,417
But what he says ultimately,
is so enlightening.

773
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,625
Look.

774
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,500
He’s a professor.

775
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:33,667
And he taught history.

776
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:38,125
He has stored a lifetime
of data in his head.

777
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:43,042
His utilization of working memory
is much superior than any ordinary man.

778
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:47,375
And on top of that, his varied interests

779
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:50,542
in literature, films, sports, music

780
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:52,917
are all stored in his head.

781
01:10:56,125 --> 01:11:00,083
But now, suddenly,
certain cells are not functioning.

782
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:02,625
Do you understand

783
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,833
how grave the crisis is?

784
01:11:08,542 --> 01:11:10,333
After speaking to him, I realized

785
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:13,958
that you are the most
important person in his life.

786
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:18,125
And you don’t live here.

787
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:52,500
Hey.

788
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:54,625
It's you.

789
01:11:57,333 --> 01:12:01,000
How long have you kept me here?

790
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:05,125
I’ve been lying here for months now.

791
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:09,167
It has only been a day.

792
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:13,792
What are you talking about?
It has been so long now.

793
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,458
I’ll take you home soon.

794
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:23,042
Don’t forget.

795
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:27,708
I won’t.

796
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:48,167
Hey! Are you still thinking?

797
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:57,667
It's lovely.

798
01:12:59,042 --> 01:12:59,917
Fabulous, in fact.

799
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,625
Don’t you have plenty
of such open-air restaurants there?

800
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,167
No.

801
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:08,958
But your idea is different.

802
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,667
Are you going to cover it up entirely
or keep some spaces open?

803
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,542
Some spaces will be open.

804
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,917
Some people might appreciate
the direct sunlight.

805
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:26,083
We have a rooftop lounge-bar there
called the Epic Sky.

806
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,833
You’ll get a lot of ideas when you see it
with your own eyes. Just come over.

807
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:31,833
Okay, maybe next year.

808
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:34,333
My US visa is valid until 2018.

809
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,750
Tell me once you've fixed the date.

810
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:41,708
Sure. But if you pretend to be busy then,
I’ll break your head open.

811
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,833
Okay.

812
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:45,708
I’ve been doing nothing
about this for a month now.

813
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:48,583
I’ll just create a blueprint,
then the transformation will begin.

814
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:53,292
I love the fact that you're taking
a plunge with anything new.

815
01:13:55,792 --> 01:13:58,125
Think of something new
then take the plunge.

816
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,333
It's good if it clicks,
or else, just go for the next one.

817
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:02,750
So, what's your next plan?

818
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:05,875
I'll contest the elections.

819
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:08,292
What?

820
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:11,625
If I manage to get an election ticket,
life is set.

821
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:18,250
Had this not been a public place,
my hand would have touched your feet.

822
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:22,750
So what if we're in public?
What’s stopping you?

823
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,542
Got it. Time’s up. Let me take my leave.

824
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:30,958
You're not supposed to.

825
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,333
Yes, I am.

826
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,208
And you know it.

827
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:39,375
Hey.

828
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,083
Who’s seeking Mayurakshi?

829
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:44,375
Is it your dad

830
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:46,792
or you?

831
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,750
Blurt it out.

832
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:57,792
If your election plan flops,

833
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:03,042
why don't you establish
a detective agency?

834
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,292
You avoided the question.

835
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:12,625
I still want an answer.

836
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:21,042
-Hey, come on!
-Hurry up!

837
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:25,292
Come on.

838
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:31,917
-Four!
-Come on!

839
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:34,292
Catch it!

840
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:02,917
ASHRAY, 30 B

841
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:52,958
Sorry to bother you.

842
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,917
-I’m looking for Mayurakshi Mukherjee--
-And you are?

843
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,000
Aryanil.

844
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:59,917
My dad is Professor Sushovan Roychowdhury.

845
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,833
Come in.

846
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:06,167
Please, leave it open.

847
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,625
Have a seat.

848
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,250
How did you know Mayurakshi

849
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:17,708
lived here?

850
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:22,083
I found her letter to Dad.

851
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:28,333
This is the address.
It's dated March 13, 2001.

852
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,583
That's 20 days after my accident.

853
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,750
Why search for Mayurakshi
after so many years?

854
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:40,458
My dad wants to see her.

855
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:42,125
I see.

856
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:43,542
May I know what happened to you?

857
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,583
I fell from the first floor
when I was drunk.

858
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,750
I have to suffer for six years now.

859
01:17:58,542 --> 01:18:00,875
But she didn’t let me die.

860
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,167
I mean

861
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:06,792
the one you came looking for.

862
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:10,958
How’s your dad?

863
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:14,458
He's suffering
from a neurological problem.

864
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:16,583
He only remembers his past memories.

865
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,500
I know a lot

866
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,542
about you and your dad.

867
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:39,333
Your dad wanted you to marry Mayurakshi.

868
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:41,917
But you didn’t want to.

869
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:45,125
That girl was strange.

870
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,708
Everyone was so self-centered.

871
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:51,083
But she took me on as her mission.

872
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,042
She cured me of my drug

873
01:18:58,125 --> 01:18:59,250
and alcohol addiction.

874
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,583
Then I realized
that unless I threw her out,

875
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:07,417
she would never have a life of her own.

876
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,333
So, I did just that.

877
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:19,083
I threw away

878
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:21,750
all of her belongings.

879
01:19:24,417 --> 01:19:25,958
I didn’t even open the door.

880
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:33,625
That window behind you...

881
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:37,917
I peeped out from there.

882
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:40,708
I saw her wept bitterly.

883
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:47,917
Then she picked up
all of her belongings and left.

884
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,750
Your dad felt bad

885
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:08,708
after seeing her like that.

886
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:13,667
That’s why she stopped
going to your house.

887
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:16,750
Where is she now?

888
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:23,458
With a patient like your dad,

889
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,625
the person who's looking after him

890
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,333
must live a miserable life.

891
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:36,875
Do you know what that means?

892
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:43,708
In this case, she could have
been the ideal caregiver.

893
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,083
She’s in Baroda now.

894
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,333
She has a nice family,

895
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,042
a loving husband and a pretty daughter.

896
01:21:00,042 --> 01:21:01,208
I often tell her,

897
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:05,042
"Had I not throw you out that day,

898
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:07,792
you wouldn’t have had
anything of your own."

899
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:12,583
Tea or coffee?

900
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:19,000
How are you now?

901
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,042
I see something ahead of me.

902
01:21:24,542 --> 01:21:26,542
What more do I need?

903
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,167
Wait here.

904
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,542
I’ll get you her address and phone number.

905
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,917
I don’t know if I should say this.

906
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:42,792
But it's not like I can help it either.

907
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,208
Mayurakshi loved you

908
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:50,125
very much.

909
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,375
Wait.

910
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:57,875
I’ll get them.

911
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:08,542
Thank you, sir.

912
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:19,958
I’ve decorated the whole house for you.

913
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,333
I got off at Howrah station

914
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:25,542
and I saw a flower market there.

915
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:28,333
The reports.

916
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:30,208
-Put them in a new file.
-Sure.

917
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:33,667
Hey.

918
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:36,583
Do you have something to say?

919
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:39,917
Do you want to rest in your room?

920
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:42,000
Okay.

921
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,208
Let's go.

922
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:57,750
Please sit here.

923
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:03,625
How about some music?

924
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:05,958
Should I put the music on?

925
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:11,667
Okay. Ravi will bring the tea here.
Please wait for it.

926
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:36,708
Here’s a soft copy
of my a curriculum vitae.

927
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,167
I mean

928
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:43,292
I don’t want to make your baggage
heavier than it is.

929
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,292
It has my system structures,
project architectures. Everything's there.

930
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:55,833
I’ll try.

931
01:24:57,375 --> 01:25:00,667
I've never aspired to be in your company.

932
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,458
Even I didn’t expect this.

933
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:07,333
But if there's any small company
with bright prospects...

934
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:12,958
You don't need to worry about your dad.

935
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:16,375
I’ll drop by every now and then
to check on him.

936
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:19,583
Excuse me.

937
01:25:20,417 --> 01:25:21,417
Yes.

938
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:25,083
I'm afraid you have to get
a new attendant tomorrow.

939
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:28,208
She says she won’t work
because the TV is not switched on.

940
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:31,208
Just imagine that.

941
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:34,333
The dinner will be served in a bit.

942
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,542
Your dad is asking for you.

943
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:37,708
Okay.

944
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,458
You guys carry on. I’ll be off now.

945
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:42,083
I'll call you later.

946
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:56,542
Come here.

947
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,375
Have you decided?

948
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:12,542
About what?

949
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,417
You see,

950
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:20,333
finding a pure soul

951
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,542
is not an easy task.

952
01:26:26,542 --> 01:26:31,208
Those around you now,

953
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:32,500
they may be

954
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:35,333
more attractive.

955
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:41,083
But Mayurakshi...

956
01:26:42,542 --> 01:26:44,750
She will hold you close.

957
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:51,458
Whenever you’re feeling scared

958
01:26:51,917 --> 01:26:53,625
and dodging around,

959
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:58,667
she’ll be with you.

960
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:03,500
You weep so much

961
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:07,375
nowadays.

962
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:11,958
I know about it. I heard everything.

963
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,958
You can’t sleep at night.

964
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
She’ll take away your sorrows.

965
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:25,333
Don't wait any longer.

966
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:28,292
You're running out of time.

967
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:33,125
Mayurakshi is dead.

968
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:39,708
She died this evening.

969
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:44,500
Right in front of my eyes.

970
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:50,375
Well, I was going
to meet her from college.

971
01:27:53,042 --> 01:27:56,917
She smiled when she saw me.

972
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:00,542
And she tried crossing the road
while looking at me.

973
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:02,750
But then a bus...

974
01:28:07,917 --> 01:28:11,125
We took her to the hospital.
But nothing else could be done.

975
01:29:16,042 --> 01:29:16,917
May I come in?

976
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:19,417
I’m right here.

977
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,500
Is anything wrong?

978
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:24,708
No.

979
01:29:57,167 --> 01:29:58,083
What’s wrong?

980
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:00,958
Sir?

981
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:02,958
What happened?

982
01:30:11,917 --> 01:30:12,833
What’s wrong?

983
01:31:01,417 --> 01:31:02,333
Is the tea ready?

984
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:04,042
Why don't you come with me?

985
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,208
I wouldn’t know what to say.

986
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:07,958
You don't know what to say?

987
01:31:08,542 --> 01:31:10,583
Just come with me. I'm scared.

988
01:31:21,792 --> 01:31:22,625
Sir.

989
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:26,958
Early this morning, your son...

990
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:29,208
Haven’t you told him?

991
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:32,042
What?

992
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:33,958
Why are you dumping everything on me?

993
01:31:35,292 --> 01:31:37,417
Your son left this morning.

994
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:40,250
He’ll go back to the US from Dehradun.

995
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,250
Who?

996
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:49,792
Your son. Mr. Aryanil. Your son.

997
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:57,708
How did he come here?

998
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:02,458
He lives in...

999
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:07,917
Where does he live?

1000
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,083
I can’t remember.

1001
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:23,958
Black Renaissance.

1002
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:16,042
I'm all right.

1003
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,000
Come downstairs.

1004
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,167
Why?

1005
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,250
Just come. Quick.

1006
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:18,042
<i>Because he is in the light of the eyes</i>

1007
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:25,583
<i>There is such play of colors and forms</i>

1008
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:30,333
<i>In the infinitude of white and black</i>

1009
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:37,375
<i>Because he is with me, eternally</i>

1010
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:46,208
<i>The southern breeze gladdens
Every part of my being</i>

1011
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:48,375
Will these clouds bring rain?

1012
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:56,875
It's for my boy’s art class.

1013
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:02,917
I’ve made

1014
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:08,917
a window here.

1015
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:15,958
He can sit there when he’s homesick.

1016
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,583
He’ll be able to see me.

1017
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:01,792
Do you want to sit here?

1018
01:36:03,417 --> 01:36:06,375
Mom, the man next to me is offering me
the window seat. Can I?

1019
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:10,083
All right.

1020
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,333
Here.

1021
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:13,375
<i>Isn’t it right, Dad?</i>
