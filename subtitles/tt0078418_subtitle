1
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:47,267
The designs are all right.

2
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,865
Work at this leisurely pace?

3
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,872
Completed in 2 months.

4
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,282
Must be completed on time.

5
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:00,876
- The boss wants you, sir.

6
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:05,283
Before you leave this evening.

7
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,887
Mr Rajkumar Gupta?

8
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,298
The boss has sent for me.

9
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:18,293
Sending for you nowadays.

10
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:21,305
- Why mustn't I?

11
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,308
Of times, for all I care.

12
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,904
Be wary of your bosses.

13
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,407
- Perfectly well.

14
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,911
Thank you very much.

15
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:40,317
He says I don't like his success!

16
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,919
I'm not a sycophant, anyway!

17
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:52,268
- Yes, do come in.

18
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:55,938
Gulabchand's proposed colony.

19
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,942
Before I sent it to him.

20
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,338
You have approved of it, sir?

21
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:04,940
I value your opinion.

22
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:08,343
Has improved our business.

23
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:10,355
Do you think I can't notice that?

24
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,948
It's very kind of you, sir.

25
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:16,357
I'm hosting a small party.

26
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:21,366
To my place which isn't right!

27
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,368
You must bring her over tomorrow.

28
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,961
- Good-bye.

29
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:30,371
- Greetings, sir.

30
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,377
I've been waiting for you.

31
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,970
Greetings, madam... Do come in.

32
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:40,384
Ask them what they need.

33
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:43,979
Do sit down, madam!

34
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,381
- Come and sit here, Raj.

35
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,287
I'll go and meet him.

36
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,386
Very well.

37
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,999
His work, even at a party!

38
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,004
Man as hard-working as your son.

39
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:01,998
You are magnanimous to say that.

40
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,001
My responsibilities to him.

41
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,309
Feel like working anymore.

42
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,409
What will I do with more?

43
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:18,680
And she's been take care of.

44
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,116
- Greetings.

45
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,528
I'm fine...

46
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:26,426
painting coming along?

47
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,524
Coming along.

48
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:32,432
- That's very kind of him.

49
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:36,038
Your mother along today.

50
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,434
Introduce you to her.

51
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,704
Have you spoken to your mother?

52
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,450
The subject with mom...

53
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,447
strange feeling!

54
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:51,045
Then won't you ever talk to her?

55
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,049
Of course, I will.

56
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,718
And make you sit in front of her.

57
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,457
What will I announce?

58
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:04,462
And I want to marry her.

59
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:05,066
And mother to sort out.

60
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:09,566
- Okay. Have some tea now.

61
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:13,477
If you insist.

62
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:18,482
After a cup of tea.

63
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:23,488
There's no need to have the tea!

64
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:28,486
My ideas are even dirtier!

65
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:41,506
You've met her so often.

66
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,100
Actually, I...

67
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:47,769
The two of us...

68
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:50,505
Would you like some more tea?

69
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:55,110
We want to get married, mom.

70
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,515
That's wonderful.

71
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:05,127
If you want to get married?

72
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,789
Have you no objections?

73
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:12,127
To fear that you might perhaps...

74
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,533
Object to the match? No...

75
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:23,138
Raj is an educated, wise man.

76
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,550
Decisions for himself.

77
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:32,547
His decisions, too.

78
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,551
Seek her blessings!

79
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:41,158
And a happy one, too.

80
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,561
May I leave now?

81
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:50,574
Yes. Raj will drop you home.

82
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:54,569
- Good-bye, Mother.

83
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:12,587
How do you find Shanti, mom?

84
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,596
I like her a lot, too.

85
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:23,205
You think of my decision?

86
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,601
- Why must you?

87
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,202
What difference must it make...

88
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:33,208
...whether I like it or not.

89
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:39,221
A difference to me.

90
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,223
Had for you...

91
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:44,218
been shattered...

92
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:53,228
your marriage today!

93
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:55,033
But what does Shanti lack...

94
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:57,641
Shanti lacks anything?

95
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:00,635
I know she's a good girl.

96
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:05,240
Will have a blissful life.

97
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:08,643
That joy for myself? - No!

98
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:10,251
Because such insignifiicant joys...

99
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:13,915
who are inconsequential.

100
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,258
Inconsequential person!

101
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,529
The bigger joys of life.

102
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,099
It makes no sense!

103
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,261
Shanti as your daughter-in-law?

104
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,100
Why wouldn't I like her?

105
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,265
A good daughter-in-law...

106
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,270
me for the rest of my life?

107
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:38,673
To think of myself.

108
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,784
I am now thinking of your future.

109
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:48,283
Your boss's daughter, Kamini.

110
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:55,793
Even think of that, mom?!

111
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:58,702
Who thought about this.

112
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:01,696
He spoke to me at the party.

113
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,297
To marry his daughter.

114
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,704
Partner in his company.

115
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:20,725
You're saying, mom?

116
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:23,727
You'd better give it a thought.

117
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,322
A mere clerk in an offiice...

118
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:33,330
only a burden of responsibilities.

119
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,335
Of the millionaire, Mr Deendayal.

120
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:42,742
Owner of a thriving company.

121
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:47,349
You have ever dreamt of!

122
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,444
But I love Shanti!

123
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,756
You have loved me!

124
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,020
But I have given her a promise!

125
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:59,758
You will achieve something in life!

126
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:06,771
Emotions and reject this opportunity!

127
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:10,365
It is Kamini you must marry!

128
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,777
It is Kamini you have to marry!

129
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,408
Partner in my company, Raj.

130
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,812
Put your signature here, son.

131
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:01,082
For you, sir.

132
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:12,836
Resolution to our bankers, too.

133
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,841
Congratulations.

134
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:30,845
To your wedding.

135
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,452
- No, I must leave.

136
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:41,856
You must be a busy man.

137
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:46,863
And I have done that.

138
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,468
There's something I must tell you.

139
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:57,479
Interest you...

140
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:01,478
my duty to inform you.

141
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:08,292
I'm expecting your baby.

142
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,507
I'm pregnant with your baby.

143
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,512
What's the matter, Raj?

144
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:10,945
Won't you ask me in?

145
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,550
Come in.

146
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:23,557
All this happened...

147
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,562
bringing up all that?

148
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,565
What's there to talk of now?

149
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:36,971
And you chose one. Period.

150
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,576
You please...

151
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:49,985
How will you manage?

152
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:56,591
That brought me here...

153
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,001
So you are here to help me?

154
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:02,267
You brought? Speak up!

155
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:06,009
Have not come here to help me.

156
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:09,003
To seek my help instead!

157
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:12,006
On your conscience!

158
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,611
Provide a house, perhaps...

159
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:19,614
the rest of my life...

160
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:24,027
burden on your soul!

161
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,625
Any help from you!

162
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:31,625
I'm going...

163
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:35,300
and from this city!

164
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:41,035
Shall bear this child.

165
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:45,640
With all my love...

166
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:51,045
a reminder of the days...

167
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:54,382
...when I truly loved someone.

168
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:12,066
You have delivered a baby-boy.

169
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:40,877
Were taking a walk in the garden.

170
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,878
Aren't you scared of death?

171
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:52,286
Every day in the last 25 years.

172
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:55,289
Be scared of death?

173
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:03,300
In a very critical condition!

174
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,912
Mother!

175
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:19,913
I'm here, mother.

176
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,917
I'm glad you have returned.

177
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:27,330
Time now, my son.

178
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:31,334
You shouldn't be saying such things!

179
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:35,930
Anything from you.

180
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:41,936
Nothing to be ashamed of.

181
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:47,612
But there is something I regret.

182
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:54,357
Any happiness in life.

183
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,952
Like this, mom?

184
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,621
All your life, only for my sake.

185
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,958
You did it all for me!

186
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:06,368
Given you anything.

187
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:10,364
- No, my son...

188
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:17,979
your eyes, not tears.

189
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:21,375
Just courage!

190
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:24,378
Take this.

191
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:27,982
This is no garland, my son...

192
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,651
...it is the saga of my life.

193
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:33,654
Always carry it with you...

194
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,997
you have made to your mother.

195
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:50,404
Have faith in me.

196
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:57,417
It does not let the weak live.

197
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:04,025
Yourself weak in life.

198
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:09,024
I have your blessings and the...

199
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:14,433
has given me.

200
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:21,445
I have to fiight the whole world!

201
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:27,043
Your son will never weaken...

202
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:54,190
that held me back this far.

203
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,858
But I'm coming now...

204
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:02,196
I'm coming, Mr R.K. Gupta!

205
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:41,235
Where's Geeta?

206
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:43,641
With your Income Tax consultant.

207
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:54,648
& Sons against their supplies?

208
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:58,760
Cheque of 1.50 lakhs on the 16th.

209
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:05,659
Will need more steel and cement.

210
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:08,764
In the offiice tomorrow.

211
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:12,266
Contracts, Mr Bhandari.

212
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,678
Its index No. Is R27.

213
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:34,688
Yes... I have found your fiile.

214
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:40,294
Over lunch tomorrow?

215
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:44,703
He's busy on the other line.

216
00:27:49,714 --> 00:27:51,306
I'll give him the line.

217
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,707
Your residence, sir.

218
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,976
Go on... I'll deal with it later.

219
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:02,590
Yes? Yes, it's me...

220
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:06,730
Why? Shekhar is arriving today!

221
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:08,323
Oh yes!

222
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,725
For the day, Geeta?

223
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,326
A meeting with the auditors...

224
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,337
on the issue of textile mill...

225
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:18,999
- Yes.

226
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:21,335
- Yes, sir.

227
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:28,342
Take Bubbly to the airport instead.

228
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:29,346
It cannot wait?

229
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:33,347
Who's returning after 2 years?

230
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:36,354
I can meet him this evening!

231
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:39,355
I will go to the airport.

232
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,371
Can you see him?

233
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,369
No matter where a man goes...

234
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:57,776
to his city, Miss...

235
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:05,785
that's a lot of luggage!

236
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:09,389
Don't be stubborn.

237
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:13,059
Who's that girl with him?

238
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,389
Looking damn smart!

239
00:29:17,802 --> 00:29:19,793
Strange happenings.

240
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:26,207
We have so much in common!

241
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:29,803
Such friends in just 5 minutes.

242
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:32,815
Know your name earlier.

243
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:35,812
- It's Shekhar Gupta!

244
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:40,413
- It's okay.

245
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:43,421
It's all in the family!

246
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:48,825
Not believe in such meetings.

247
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,429
Is pre-destined.

248
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:53,093
What do you think of that...

249
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,449
Welcome home, brother!

250
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,455
- He was coming along, but...

251
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:24,296
He asked you to fetch me...

252
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:26,860
the evening, right?

253
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,963
How did you guess, brother?

254
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:33,876
Clothes. What's the white for?

255
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,870
Badminton tournament today.

256
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:40,874
You home. I wonder if I'll make it.

257
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,886
What's the hurry?

258
00:30:47,892 --> 00:30:49,883
This is your offiice.

259
00:30:52,897 --> 00:30:54,330
You will occupy that chair...

260
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,890
millions of Rupees.

261
00:30:57,902 --> 00:30:59,164
To go to London and...

262
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:01,496
Business Management...

263
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:03,906
beneniit from it.

264
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:07,503
And be a petty musician?!

265
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:10,909
What would you have been?

266
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,352
What's that about the computer?

267
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:21,515
Right answer to every question.

268
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:25,924
Live-computer of the company!

269
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:28,522
Much of cement and stuff has gone...

270
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:32,367
wing of any of our buildings!

271
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:33,526
If not a computer?

272
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,330
I must thank you for it!

273
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:41,341
Fresh hearing-date on this case.

274
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:47,946
I wonder when this story will end!

275
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,044
What's the matter, dad?

276
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:52,212
Some seven years ago.

277
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:55,958
There is this thug called...

278
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,222
Yes. He encroached on our land.

279
00:31:58,563 --> 00:32:01,555
Took possession of your land?

280
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:02,557
We fiiled a case...

281
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,231
last 6 years without a decision.

282
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:08,068
Plot in the bargain.

283
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:30,584
I want to meet R.K. Gupta.

284
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,992
- Vijay Kumar.

285
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:37,928
To meet Mr R.K. Gupta.

286
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:41,595
- Sorry... he's busy.

287
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:42,597
Cannot meet a man...

288
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:45,599
profiit in lakhs?

289
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,613
- Tell him that I wish to see him.

290
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:04,022
Wants to see you immediately.

291
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:07,020
I don't have the time now.

292
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,625
At a later date, Mr R.K. Gupta.

293
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:13,626
Before I leave I must tell you...

294
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,631
a meeting of 5 minutes...

295
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:19,032
a loss of 5 lakh Rupees!

296
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:25,305
Send him in, Geeta.

297
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:04,344
Sit down.

298
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:14,087
What is it?

299
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:18,494
I have just 5 minutes for you.

300
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:25,700
You had purchased a piece of land...

301
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:28,703
priced Rs. 3 lakh...

302
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:33,106
at least 5 lakh Rupees today.

303
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:36,118
Bit productive for you because...

304
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:40,714
has illegally occupied it.

305
00:34:42,393 --> 00:34:45,385
Your 5 lakhs is as good as sunk.

306
00:34:47,131 --> 00:34:52,125
Recover my lost money?

307
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:56,129
That piece of land.

308
00:34:58,409 --> 00:34:59,740
Time as Madhav vacates it...

309
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:04,147
...that land is worth nothing?

310
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,748
Lawyers have not been successful...

311
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,744
...in evicting him

312
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:15,751
want to buy that piece of land.

313
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,756
Agreed to meet you?

314
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:25,760
Spoke to me over the intercom...

315
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:32,165
dynamic and intelligent man.

316
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:34,769
Confiidence in himself...

317
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,172
a sound scheme to me.

318
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:43,777
Inexperienced young man...

319
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,780
a lot of wealth from his father...

320
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:51,792
and neither do I aspire for it!

321
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:55,791
It's the blessings of my mother.

322
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:59,800
Tell you, Mr R.K. Gupta.

323
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:01,635
Deal worth 5 lakh Rupees...

324
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:04,798
pennies in my pocket!

325
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,803
If you do let me have the land...

326
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:14,216
back in fiifteen days.

327
00:36:32,236 --> 00:36:33,828
Something in 15 days...

328
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:39,833
to do in 6 long years.

329
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:44,237
Right now, Mr Bhandari.

330
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:48,246
Buy our plot at Model Town.

331
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:51,852
Contract will be...

332
00:36:53,524 --> 00:36:54,855
not pay us Rs. 5 lakh in 15 days...

333
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:58,859
him for fraud and deceit.

334
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,524
Please go with him.

335
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:20,874
Is your name Madhav Singh?

336
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,549
What is it?

337
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,552
Have raised a township of sin...

338
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,551
Gupta & Sons till recently.

339
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:36,298
And it now belongs to me.

340
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,892
Maybe. Come to the point!

341
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:41,897
Your illegal vice dens...

342
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:48,404
before 11 a.m. Tomorrow.

343
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,905
I want this land vacated.

344
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,574
Are you out of your mind?

345
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,912
By 11 a.m. Tomorrow.

346
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:09,930
11 a.m. Tomorrow.

347
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,930
Crazy guy!

348
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:24,346
Land has indeed been sold to you.

349
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,349
A payment of 5 lakh Rupees.

350
00:38:29,353 --> 00:38:31,947
To me for the money?

351
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:33,948
Leading fiinanciers of the city...

352
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,351
lend money in millions.

353
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,457
But who'd want that land as security?

354
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:48,370
By a thug called Madhav Singh.

355
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,369
- Please don't worry about that.

356
00:38:52,643 --> 00:38:54,634
Plot by 11 a.m. Tomorrow.

357
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:58,638
Vacate the plot?

358
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:03,977
And I will get possession of it.

359
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:08,648
I'll deal with the rest.

360
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:10,984
That turns out to be true.

361
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:13,987
The 5 lakh Rupees to me?

362
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,331
I'll build a colony on the plot...

363
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,994
intended but could not build.

364
00:39:28,412 --> 00:39:30,403
Will vacate the land?

365
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,007
By 11 a.m. Tomorrow.

366
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,411
- It's almost 11!

367
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:40,012
Are you out of your mind?

368
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:41,514
That he'd come here?

369
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:45,018
Can't be trusted, boss.

370
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:09,042
Here I am.

371
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:13,048
But you will not return.

372
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,453
I'm here to send you packing.

373
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:24,057
Brought an ambulance.

374
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:26,066
Reaching the hospital...

375
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:29,062
...after I thrash you guys.

376
00:40:36,614 --> 00:40:38,605
Leave him alone!

377
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:18,898
Get up!

378
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:23,903
Take him away!

379
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:30,243
Toss him in the van!

380
00:43:40,931 --> 00:43:42,660
To the emergency ward!

381
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,961
And check it thoroughly.

382
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:20,960
Dad said it's very important...

383
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:29,302
This is Shekhar, Mr Gupta's son.

384
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,710
And I'm terribly impressed!

385
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:35,309
Not do in 6 years...

386
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,314
in just one day!

387
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,322
Something important to discuss?

388
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:46,728
A cheque of Rs. 5 lakhs.

389
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:48,320
- You must give it to my father...

390
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:52,325
Why drag me into this?

391
00:44:53,737 --> 00:44:58,731
It's one and the same thing for me.

392
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:00,332
- All right.

393
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:04,746
You're not in a hurry, are you?

394
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:06,338
No, I am in no hurry.

395
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:10,350
We'll keep meeting in the future.

396
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:20,758
Seems to be a great guy!

397
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:26,759
He has left this cheque for you.

398
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:29,202
He had 15 days to make the payment.

399
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:31,764
Cheque on the 7th day itself.

400
00:45:34,044 --> 00:45:36,376
We had this problem for so long, dad.

401
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,771
Vacated in just one day!

402
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:41,374
That was a miracle!

403
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:44,378
Having the land vacated...

404
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,382
in such short a time.

405
00:45:50,794 --> 00:45:54,787
He was capable of doing all this.

406
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:01,803
Achieve a lot in life.

407
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:42,835
Academic record.

408
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:50,443
Required for this job.

409
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:55,956
All you lack is experience at work.

410
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:57,957
I have just graduated

411
00:46:59,129 --> 00:47:01,859
only if I fiind a job.

412
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:03,457
Job opportunities...

413
00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:05,459
work experience...

414
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,462
get any experience?

415
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:14,876
For all your inadequacies.

416
00:47:15,879 --> 00:47:16,470
Guys here for the job...

417
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:19,872
come without any recommendation.

418
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:22,875
Report on duty tomorrow.

419
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:32,471
Now don't act smart.

420
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:36,874
This job you had applied for?

421
00:47:37,881 --> 00:47:41,146
To make you run to your brother...

422
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:41,479
to give me the job?

423
00:47:43,153 --> 00:47:45,485
Of my guts and qualifiications.

424
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:48,153
Recommendations from anyone.

425
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:49,481
The job because of me...

426
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:52,485
you'd have been subjected to!

427
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:55,488
You're always play-acting!

428
00:47:55,899 --> 00:47:58,891
A story with another.

429
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:00,492
Is another matter.

430
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:04,497
Daughter, when I meet you.

431
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:05,505
Never consider myself...

432
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,910
...a friend of the boss's daughter!

433
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,511
Most sincerely!

434
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:14,907
Your General Manager at 1 p.m.

435
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,911
I think it's already 1 p.m.

436
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:22,022
Don't we both think alike!

437
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:39,531
Are you the...

438
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,542
Manager of this company.

439
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,538
Please take a seat.

440
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:49,541
Actually, I...

441
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,552
You appear to be stunned.

442
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:56,949
No! It's nothing of the sort!

443
00:48:57,961 --> 00:48:59,952
The wrong expressions!

444
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,563
I'm absolutely thrilled, Miss...

445
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:11,563
What did you say your name was?

446
00:49:12,376 --> 00:49:14,367
I haven't yet told you my name.

447
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:18,976
If you were to tell me?

448
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,909
Miss Sheetal Varma!

449
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:32,593
To see you occupy that chair!

450
00:49:33,997 --> 00:49:35,589
Women were expected...

451
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,594
and raise children.

452
00:49:41,004 --> 00:49:42,596
Proved to the world...

453
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:46,601
in any way inferior to men!

454
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,601
- Indeed! There's no doubt!

455
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,614
Engineers, doctors and pilots!

456
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,280
College or a journalist...,

457
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,420
of a company, if she so wishes!

458
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:05,026
Step for every step!

459
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:09,030
Your spectacular success!

460
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:14,633
Were bound in the shackles...

461
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:17,436
...of customs and traditions.

462
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,033
Broken the shackles!

463
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:23,636
In society today!

464
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:26,311
You are free souls!

465
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,645
On the freedom you enjoy!

466
00:50:34,057 --> 00:50:36,048
On Women's Liberation.

467
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,060
To business now?

468
00:50:40,063 --> 00:50:42,657
A request to make.

469
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:44,663
It'll be lunch-time soon.

470
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:49,163
Enjoy a lunch at posh restaurants...

471
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:55,067
- To tell you the truth...

472
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,505
I know it all, Miss Sheetal!

473
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,340
Woman in your place...

474
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:00,672
old customs and traditions...

475
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:04,176
...you would have turned me down!

476
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:06,679
But you don't regret being a woman!

477
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,016
I am confiident therefore...

478
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:11,083

479
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:14,359
You will prove to the world...

480
00:51:14,498 --> 00:51:16,693
have lunch with you today...

481
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:21,694
effect on the progress...

482
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:25,698
womanhood in the world.

483
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:27,701
I'd hate to see that happen.

484
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:31,706
Join you for lunch today.

485
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:35,112
We have so much in common!

486
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:40,713
You aren't eating anything!

487
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:42,722
I've had today...

488
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:46,123

489
00:51:48,131 --> 00:51:50,122
- Yes.

490
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:55,735
I need some exercise.

491
00:51:56,406 --> 00:52:00,137
Evening and play golf every Sunday.

492
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:06,138
I'm fond of all these, too!

493
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,742
We have so much in common!

494
00:55:57,981 --> 00:55:59,972
Could I drop you somewhere?

495
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:10,985
A company, Shanti Constructions.

496
00:56:12,395 --> 00:56:14,386
I have a few contracts.

497
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:15,995
But if you help me...

498
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:19,999
big assignment.

499
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,662
Which one is that?

500
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:25,838
Are getting a building made...

501
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:28,400
...for their offiice.

502
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:32,512
Fiiling a tender for that contract.

503
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:37,016
Few people apart from Mr Gupta...

504
00:56:39,022 --> 00:56:41,013
And you happen to be one of them.

505
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:43,022
Your company has fiiled...

506
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:49,021
prices and bag the contract.

507
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:55,434
Organisation I work for, Mr Vijay?!

508
00:56:56,439 --> 00:56:57,872
What's wrong with that?

509
00:56:58,441 --> 00:57:03,037
You peanuts for your hard work, too?

510
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:07,445
I'd be willing to help you?

511
00:57:07,784 --> 00:57:11,049
Pay you a price for your help.

512
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:14,045
- You are perhaps...

513
00:57:25,468 --> 00:57:28,062

514
00:57:29,472 --> 00:57:30,905
...but looks like you don't know...

515
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:34,068
the world is up for sale!

516
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:47,482
You seem to be in a hurry!

517
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,581
Gangu! How are you?

518
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,084
Since this morning.

519
00:57:53,496 --> 00:57:54,929
For some money today!

520
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:58,092
Paid you 300 Rupees!

521
00:57:58,768 --> 00:58:00,759
To give you!

522
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:04,096
No money to give me...

523
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:07,770
to splurge on the young dame!

524
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:11,110
You have a wife and young children.

525
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:13,505
Mistress in a separate house!

526
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:16,508
Just you watch out, Bhandari!

527
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,512
With me over money...

528
00:58:21,124 --> 00:58:24,525
to this whore's doorstep!

529
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:27,119
- Gangu! You take every joke seriously!

530
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:30,622
You're a strange man!

531
00:58:32,535 --> 00:58:35,527
Cough it up! Out with the money!

532
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:40,133
- Shut up!

533
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,134
I'm going to be broke!

534
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:46,547
The fun you have, Bhandari!

535
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,141
Now get lost... go away!

536
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:55,154
Squeezed out of you?

537
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,551
Quiet! There are people at home!

538
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:01,820
But how do you know all this?

539
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:03,996
Let's not worry about that...

540
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,658
your well-being instead.

541
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:10,562
I can rid you of Gangu.

542
00:59:11,574 --> 00:59:14,168
- It's the tender Mr R.K. Gupta...

543
00:59:15,578 --> 00:59:18,172
Shipping Corporation...

544
00:59:19,582 --> 00:59:23,575
before they are dispatched.

545
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:31,691
But you will fiix Gangu fiirst.

546
00:59:33,596 --> 00:59:37,589
The streets you walk on.

547
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:43,696
Consider your work done, too.

548
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:47,872
But you must fiix my problem fiirst.

549
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:52,206
- Right away, sir.

550
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:57,718
And betel-leaf they ask for.

551
00:59:58,621 --> 01:00:01,215
I'll settle it with you.

552
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:04,216
For you just now.

553
01:00:04,627 --> 01:00:06,618
Who the hell is that?

554
01:00:08,631 --> 01:00:10,622
There he is!

555
01:00:14,637 --> 01:00:16,628
Who is that?

556
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:40,259
- What's up?

557
01:00:41,664 --> 01:00:45,657
- I do... so?

558
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,671
Acquaintance anymore. Got it?

559
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:55,274
I make others see it!

560
01:03:02,805 --> 01:03:04,796
Strong man?

561
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:07,065
And bash me up!

562
01:03:07,477 --> 01:03:11,914
Bhandari again, Gangu...

563
01:03:13,082 --> 01:03:15,915
not to the hospital, okay?

564
01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:18,810
Of course, it's okay!

565
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:22,914
The lanes Bhandari walks on!

566
01:03:23,826 --> 01:03:26,818
If you ask me to!

567
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,421
Get going!

568
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,830
Take 'em away!

569
01:03:45,114 --> 01:03:47,446
Started this company!

570
01:03:48,117 --> 01:03:51,848
With a contract I've wanted!

571
01:03:52,855 --> 01:03:54,288
Walks into the business...

572
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:56,848
...and snatches a contract

573
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,851
It's okay, Daddy.

574
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:02,454
We quoted a price in our tender.

575
01:04:02,865 --> 01:04:06,460
Lesser sum for the same facilities.

576
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:08,302
Have got the contract.

577
01:04:08,871 --> 01:04:11,863
I've found every detail about that.

578
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:14,132
Of amount in our tenders?

579
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,476
- One Rupee?

580
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,871
Yes! One Rupee!

581
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:22,481
Was the same as ours.

582
01:04:23,886 --> 01:04:25,319
One measly Rupee!

583
01:04:25,888 --> 01:04:30,484
It's an extremely interesting one.

584
01:04:30,893 --> 01:04:33,487
As if Vijay Kumar knew...

585
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:36,488
...the details of our tender.

586
01:04:36,899 --> 01:04:38,332
But how is that possible?

587
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:41,495
Who knew about it, it was I...

588
01:04:42,505 --> 01:04:44,166
...and Miss Geeta.

589
01:04:44,507 --> 01:04:46,168
I can't understand how...

590
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:50,912
You may go now.

591
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:05,024
Of Rs. 3000, hadn't you?

592
01:05:05,928 --> 01:05:07,919
I was in need of the money.

593
01:05:09,198 --> 01:05:12,929
Bhandari before you leave.

594
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:24,942
Funeral pyre...

595
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:30,208
for the one who has tormented you.

596
01:05:31,954 --> 01:05:33,945
Of my battles today.

597
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:38,216
But this is nothing...

598
01:05:39,962 --> 01:05:41,953
...the war is yet to begin.

599
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:46,558
Bless me!

600
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:57,973
Games life plays with me.

601
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,240
I have always won the games...

602
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:06,414
No matter what I had resort to...

603
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:10,248
...or what price I had to pay.

604
01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:15,987
The habit of winning.

605
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:23,267
Defeat after all these years...

606
01:06:26,008 --> 01:06:27,999
Do you think I'll quit the game?

607
01:06:29,011 --> 01:06:34,005
Never do that!

608
01:06:39,021 --> 01:06:41,615
- Just a minute more.

609
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,621
How are you?

610
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:53,627
What happened the other day.

611
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:56,294
But believe me...

612
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,133
you a lot since that day.

613
01:07:01,043 --> 01:07:02,476
- Yes.

614
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:07,878
Striking a deal, I hope?

615
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:08,642
Not at all!

616
01:07:10,052 --> 01:07:11,644
I remember what you told me.

617
01:07:12,054 --> 01:07:14,045
The world is up for sale.

618
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:17,053
Put that incident behind us.

619
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,060
Or it would really hurt me.

620
01:07:23,065 --> 01:07:24,498
Comes from the heart...

621
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:27,661
3

622
01:07:29,071 --> 01:07:31,062
I'm through with my shopping!

623
01:07:32,074 --> 01:07:34,167
She's R.K. Gupta's daughter.

624
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:43,347
While I settle the bill.

625
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:55,694
I'm not late, I hope?

626
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:59,691
- She's settling the bill.

627
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:25,116
You will get your money, Bhandari...

628
01:08:25,728 --> 01:08:27,719
is useful to me.

629
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:31,122
Gladden your heart, sir!

630
01:08:32,134 --> 01:08:33,726
Maniklal Memorial...

631
01:08:34,136 --> 01:08:36,730
biggest hospital in Asia.

632
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,731
Contract to build the hospital...

633
01:08:41,143 --> 01:08:43,077
...will roll in wealth!

634
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:44,737
Information have you brought?

635
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,574
Given you earlier!

636
01:08:49,151 --> 01:08:51,585
Of the tender...

637
01:08:52,154 --> 01:08:55,146
fiiled for the contract.

638
01:08:59,161 --> 01:08:59,752
A great risk, sir!

639
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:06,160
I'll have lost my job!

640
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:09,762
I have with you, I thought...

641
01:09:12,775 --> 01:09:14,766
...I'd take the risk!

642
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:23,775
Thank you very much!

643
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:26,444
You may leave now, Bhandari.

644
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,796
Have prepared for...

645
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:41,800
...the Maniklal Memorial contract.

646
01:09:44,206 --> 01:09:46,197
Some changes in it.

647
01:09:47,209 --> 01:09:50,804
Bagged this contract, too?!

648
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:55,473
Between our tenders?

649
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:13,825
Maniklal Memorial hospital...

650
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:16,327
...has gone to Vijay Kumar.

651
01:10:19,241 --> 01:10:22,836
Difference between our contracts...

652
01:10:24,513 --> 01:10:26,640
...was once again just one rupee.

653
01:10:27,249 --> 01:10:31,242
- Right... one rupee.

654
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:36,423
The difference of a rupee?

655
01:10:36,592 --> 01:10:38,856
- For the difference of...

656
01:10:39,862 --> 01:10:42,262
rupees did he pay you?

657
01:10:42,398 --> 01:10:44,389
Are you insinuating that...

658
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:48,867
be a mere co-incidence!

659
01:10:49,271 --> 01:10:51,865
Everything about our tenders!

660
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,866
Reveal the details to him?

661
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,270
Who know about the tenders!

662
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:01,281
Knows Vijay the best!

663
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:04,876
Go ahead and deny that!

664
01:11:05,287 --> 01:11:07,278
I don't ever meet Vijay!

665
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,882
Bump into him twice!

666
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:13,557
Has occurred twice, too!

667
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:19,891
Level such a false accusation at me!

668
01:11:20,302 --> 01:11:23,897
Loyalty and sincerity!

669
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:27,303
You used to!

670
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:43,323
Before I leave, sir.

671
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:47,327
My voice against you.

672
01:11:48,597 --> 01:11:49,928
And sincerity for what it is worth...

673
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:56,928
offence at what he says.

674
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,332
Such a man deserves only sympathy.

675
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:14,946
By now that one of his men...

676
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:20,952
...is hand-in-glove with me.

677
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:25,760
- I'm a smart guy, sir.

678
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:29,627
But it wasn't me!

679
01:12:29,972 --> 01:12:31,963
He unleashed a storm on poor Geeta!

680
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,967
With you somewhere.

681
01:12:36,378 --> 01:12:39,370
She is in league with you!

682
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:40,979
Crucial information to you!

683
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,641
That's it! He promptly sacked her!

684
01:12:45,387 --> 01:12:47,378
- Come along!

685
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,992
What misbehaviour is this?!

686
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:55,990
Bring your tenders to me...

687
01:12:57,399 --> 01:13:00,391
...for a handful of money.

688
01:13:01,403 --> 01:13:03,394
Sacked an honest girl!

689
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,664
This is the culprit!

690
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:10,410
What is this I hear, Bhandari?

691
01:13:24,026 --> 01:13:26,494
In this offiice again!

692
01:13:26,595 --> 01:13:32,033
We ought to thank you, Mr Vijay.

693
01:13:33,035 --> 01:13:35,026
That's not necessary.

694
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:37,035
Relationship with Miss Geeta...

695
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,443
take the blame for my sake.

696
01:13:43,645 --> 01:13:45,636
To do all this?

697
01:13:46,448 --> 01:13:48,439
Bhandari was helping you.

698
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:51,709
Iosses, by exposing him?

699
01:13:53,455 --> 01:13:56,447
Are above gains and losses.

700
01:13:57,459 --> 01:13:59,723
Alas! Not everybody realises it.

701
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:18,736
Discuss with you, Geeta.

702
01:14:20,482 --> 01:14:22,473
Which is why I wanted to meet you.

703
01:14:26,088 --> 01:14:27,749
What are you doing nowadays?

704
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,082
Work at nothing, work wonders!

705
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,751
Wonders nowadays!

706
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:42,493
Will you work with me?

707
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,765
Why are you offering me a job?

708
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:52,446
For me losing my job, right?

709
01:14:52,514 --> 01:14:55,108
No. That is not the reason.

710
01:14:57,519 --> 01:15:00,511
Growing and expanding...

711
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:05,521
I have a long way to go.

712
01:15:07,129 --> 01:15:08,960
Shanti Constructions...

713
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:10,120
corner of the city...

714
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:13,124
other sign board of its kind.

715
01:15:17,539 --> 01:15:19,530
Etched in the skies.

716
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:25,136
I can achieve all that, Geeta.

717
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:31,552
Workers to help me achieve my goal.

718
01:15:34,556 --> 01:15:38,549
Ioyal and hardworking than you are?

719
01:15:39,828 --> 01:15:41,819
Work with me then?

720
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:48,167
More passionate about his work.

721
01:15:48,303 --> 01:15:50,294
My question.

722
01:15:51,173 --> 01:15:53,164
Offiice open every morning?

723
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:58,176
There is no closing time.

724
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:20,858
The estimates are ready.

725
01:16:28,877 --> 01:16:31,209
And type them for me.

726
01:16:33,215 --> 01:16:35,206
Elevation plan already?

727
01:16:36,618 --> 01:16:38,210
He's doing it.

728
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,611
Take a short break...

729
01:16:41,623 --> 01:16:43,056
Rest for a while.

730
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:47,220
It should be sent tomorrow.

731
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:50,222
Before the deadline.

732
01:16:50,632 --> 01:16:54,227
What's the hurry? We have time.

733
01:16:55,904 --> 01:17:00,238
No, Geeta. I have no time at all.

734
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:04,902
I'm in a very great hurry.

735
01:17:05,914 --> 01:17:07,245
Achieved in 25 years...

736
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,650
...I must accomplish in one year.

737
01:17:54,696 --> 01:17:58,291
Anniversary on December 11.

738
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:03,301
On the occasion.

739
01:18:04,706 --> 01:18:06,697
Everything will be taken care of.

740
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:10,103
Invite every big man in town.

741
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:16,315
R.K. Gupta and Sons.

742
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:19,977
They're still considered big.

743
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:31,329
- He should be here soon.

744
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:41,334
By your visit!

745
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:10,361
With Shekhar Gupta?

746
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,371
Sheetal Varma.

747
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:16,374
Shekhar, very often.

748
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:26,384
- Of course, we will.

749
01:19:34,396 --> 01:19:36,887
Our host, Mr Vijay!

750
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:02,079
- That's right.

751
01:20:02,824 --> 01:20:06,419
But I have never met you earlier.

752
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:10,423
A lot about you.

753
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:12,259
- Just that...

754
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:15,926
in such short a span of time.

755
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:22,103
I always get it.

756
01:20:22,844 --> 01:20:25,438
Of confiidence in yourself?

757
01:20:26,848 --> 01:20:28,839
Much more than you can imagine.

758
01:20:31,853 --> 01:20:33,844
Mr Varma's daughter. Or...

759
01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:37,288
My drink is over.

760
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:39,450
If you permit me...

761
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:26,149
I don't usually attend parties.

762
01:21:26,894 --> 01:21:29,158
With the invitation...

763
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:35,494
very keen on having me here.

764
01:21:35,903 --> 01:21:38,997
- Thank you very much.

765
01:21:40,174 --> 01:21:43,507
Who are happy at another's success.

766
01:21:44,178 --> 01:21:47,511
Attend the party or not.

767
01:21:48,515 --> 01:21:51,507
To celebrate your success...

768
01:21:52,186 --> 01:21:53,517
I would certainly have come.

769
01:21:54,521 --> 01:21:55,510
Admit it or not...

770
01:21:56,523 --> 01:21:58,514
contributed to your success...

771
01:22:01,528 --> 01:22:03,519
with Bhandari's help.

772
01:22:04,932 --> 01:22:08,197
Today, is because of you.

773
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:14,201
That I've received from you in life.

774
01:22:15,209 --> 01:22:18,542
Certainly repay one day.

775
01:22:19,213 --> 01:22:20,544
I stand guarantee for that!

776
01:22:21,215 --> 01:22:25,948
Be admitted. He does what he says.

777
01:22:26,954 --> 01:22:28,216
He owes you.

778
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:33,552
That's the last word!

779
01:22:34,228 --> 01:22:36,219
He will certainly do it!

780
01:22:59,987 --> 01:23:01,978
- Yes, sir.

781
01:23:03,257 --> 01:23:05,987
- You had asked for some books?

782
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:09,585
Give them to Bubbly.

783
01:23:19,273 --> 01:23:21,264
It's you I was thinking about!

784
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:25,272
That you'd change so much.

785
01:23:26,347 --> 01:23:29,612
Had such bad habits earlier!

786
01:23:30,117 --> 01:23:32,608
When you talk like this?

787
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,287
How do I look?

788
01:23:37,624 --> 01:23:41,424
What does that mean?

789
01:23:41,695 --> 01:23:46,029
It means...

790
01:23:46,433 --> 01:23:49,630
That should make headlines!

791
01:23:50,304 --> 01:23:54,035
Propagating a new language!

792
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:57,041
Whose fiirst words are...

793
01:23:57,644 --> 01:24:00,636
The next words are...

794
01:27:11,505 --> 01:27:14,497
if not with me, Bhandari?

795
01:27:16,843 --> 01:27:23,510
Have something against R.K. Gupta.

796
01:27:23,850 --> 01:27:27,843
To grind against R.K. Gupta?

797
01:27:28,255 --> 01:27:31,247
Right from the times...

798
01:27:32,526 --> 01:27:35,859
in Mr Deendayal's company.

799
01:27:36,129 --> 01:27:38,859
It's good enough.

800
01:27:40,534 --> 01:27:42,866
For about 4 lakh of Rupees.

801
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,533
Being auctioned away?

802
01:27:50,677 --> 01:27:54,545
It's going for 2.75 lakh...

803
01:27:56,883 --> 01:28:00,284
- 2.80 lakhs!

804
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:05,883
- 3 lakhs!

805
01:28:06,059 --> 01:28:08,550
3 lakhs... 3 lakhs!

806
01:28:09,296 --> 01:28:11,890
- 3. 10 lakhs...!

807
01:28:15,569 --> 01:28:17,560
4. 10 lakhs!

808
01:28:20,407 --> 01:28:22,398
4. 10 lakhs!

809
01:28:25,579 --> 01:28:27,570
4.20 lakhs!

810
01:28:28,582 --> 01:28:30,573
4.20 lakhs!

811
01:28:34,921 --> 01:28:37,321
5. 20 lakhs!

812
01:28:37,591 --> 01:28:39,582
5. 20 lakhs!

813
01:28:52,739 --> 01:28:53,763
Slip out of our hands.

814
01:28:54,608 --> 01:28:57,941
In business, Sinha...

815
01:28:58,945 --> 01:29:00,936
...not your emotions.

816
01:29:01,615 --> 01:29:02,946
Worth 4 or 5 lakhs...

817
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:08,614
just to spite someone?

818
01:29:10,624 --> 01:29:12,615
No... this is no business.

819
01:29:14,461 --> 01:29:18,955
Of Mr Vijay Kumar outbidding you.

820
01:29:21,368 --> 01:29:25,361
Now... he's into something else...

821
01:29:26,973 --> 01:29:28,463
Why is he doing it?

822
01:30:01,675 --> 01:30:06,009
Construction starts tomorrow.

823
01:30:16,022 --> 01:30:19,014
Appear to be pretty close.

824
01:30:21,428 --> 01:30:23,419
They indeed are.

825
01:30:24,431 --> 01:30:25,864
A split between them...

826
01:30:26,433 --> 01:30:28,697
Shekhar a lot of discomfort.

827
01:30:30,704 --> 01:30:33,036
The cause of the split.

828
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:37,700
What are you getting at?

829
01:30:40,046 --> 01:30:45,040
Honour from R.K. Gupta's family...

830
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,714
their smiles and happiness.

831
01:30:55,061 --> 01:30:59,464
He must not get her.

832
01:31:00,567 --> 01:31:03,730
Of Mr R.K. Gupta in business.

833
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:06,063
The rivalry to such extremes!

834
01:31:09,075 --> 01:31:10,064
Son's personal life...

835
01:31:11,077 --> 01:31:15,070
Iove and war, Geeta!

836
01:31:15,582 --> 01:31:16,913
No matter what you say...

837
01:31:17,584 --> 01:31:19,074
between Shekhar and Sheetal...

838
01:31:21,087 --> 01:31:22,076
with Mr R.K. Gupta...

839
01:31:25,091 --> 01:31:27,082
legitimate excuse.

840
01:31:28,762 --> 01:31:34,496
Is illegitimate or legitimate.

841
01:31:38,772 --> 01:31:42,765
Tell her that I wish to see her.

842
01:31:43,176 --> 01:31:45,508
The other day...

843
01:31:46,112 --> 01:31:48,103
are normally very boring.

844
01:31:49,115 --> 01:31:50,104
A party again?

845
01:31:51,117 --> 01:31:52,106
You fiind your photographs?

846
01:31:53,787 --> 01:31:56,517
Reflect what I look like!

847
01:31:57,524 --> 01:31:59,515
No wonder, they look good.

848
01:32:00,794 --> 01:32:02,785
You. Won't you offer me some tea?

849
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,521
The tea is here!

850
01:32:17,544 --> 01:32:19,944
- Why?

851
01:32:21,815 --> 01:32:25,808
Building tomorrow morning.

852
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:31,154
- Stone with your lucky hands.

853
01:32:31,558 --> 01:32:33,549
I?! You must be joking!

854
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,151
That's the preserve of celebrities.

855
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:40,163
My friends are my celebrities.

856
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:43,161
I can't do it!

857
01:32:47,574 --> 01:32:49,166
I look for you inside...

858
01:32:50,176 --> 01:32:51,973
merrily chatting away!

859
01:32:52,178 --> 01:32:55,841
Vijay has landed me in a dilemma.

860
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:58,181
I see! And what is the dilemma?

861
01:32:58,852 --> 01:33:00,183
And this is one of those times...

862
01:33:01,855 --> 01:33:03,186
your problem in a minute!

863
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:07,182
What your predicament is!

864
01:33:07,527 --> 01:33:12,863
Foundation-stone of his new building.

865
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,188
- Say what?

866
01:33:15,201 --> 01:33:16,190
He wants you to perform...

867
01:33:17,203 --> 01:33:21,867
ceremony, right? So do it!

868
01:33:22,609 --> 01:33:24,600
Had he asked you not do it!

869
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:26,200
To throw it away!

870
01:33:27,213 --> 01:33:29,875
Those heavy stones, you know!

871
01:33:30,216 --> 01:33:32,616
Laying it? I can't understand!

872
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,209
Your appeal!

873
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:40,223
When have you planned it, Vijay?

874
01:33:41,227 --> 01:33:42,216
It's at 10.30 tomorrow.

875
01:33:43,229 --> 01:33:45,891
I'll bring her along!

876
01:33:51,067 --> 01:33:52,056
Is tonight, Sheetal.

877
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,062
Of this new building?

878
01:33:57,473 --> 01:33:59,065
It is to celebrate the fact...

879
01:33:59,742 --> 01:34:01,733
the foundation-stone.

880
01:39:12,521 --> 01:39:16,048
And accompany us.

881
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:25,116
Suddenly reminded of you.

882
01:41:06,902 --> 01:41:08,893
Why aren't you special?

883
01:41:41,203 --> 01:41:46,539
To tell you, for many days now.

884
01:42:14,236 --> 01:42:17,069
Delay would have been very late.

885
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:38,583
And came down here.

886
01:43:17,032 --> 01:43:19,626
Have one, Sheetal.

887
01:43:55,671 --> 01:44:00,074
Enough of fun and games.

888
01:45:17,419 --> 01:45:20,752
My cuff-links?

889
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:50,441
The car from today.

890
01:46:32,227 --> 01:46:34,218
Get the fiirst-aid box, will you?

891
01:47:27,282 --> 01:47:29,876
Away the stains very easily.

892
01:48:13,929 --> 01:48:16,591
Everything you do.

893
01:48:39,454 --> 01:48:41,945
I was absolutely delighted!

894
01:49:19,995 --> 01:49:21,986
What's wrong with you?

895
01:49:49,024 --> 01:49:52,516
An extent! What for?

896
01:50:56,758 --> 01:50:58,749
To someone else?

897
01:51:19,514 --> 01:51:23,780
Of them can do anything for you.

898
01:51:44,206 --> 01:51:46,538
I can never forget that!

899
01:55:50,051 --> 01:55:52,383
Colony we're looking forward to.

900
01:56:16,811 --> 01:56:18,802
Will get the profiits.

901
01:57:03,858 --> 01:57:07,851
Slip out of my hands.

902
01:57:48,169 --> 01:57:49,500
Like Bhandari from my company...

903
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:18,529
can make it big...

904
01:58:44,559 --> 01:58:46,550
achieved this respect and wealth...

905
01:59:08,583 --> 01:59:09,572
as a sell-out of my conscience...

906
01:59:46,287 --> 01:59:48,278
You will get a house.

907
02:00:28,329 --> 02:00:30,320
Him some money and...

908
02:01:03,698 --> 02:01:07,361
made so much of money.

909
02:01:46,407 --> 02:01:50,400
In the world forgave her.

910
02:02:23,444 --> 02:02:25,776
To give birth to me.

911
02:03:04,819 --> 02:03:05,808
The riches from the man...

912
02:03:47,261 --> 02:03:49,661
I've heard of him, sir.

913
02:04:23,898 --> 02:04:26,890
I'm meeting you, Mr Varma...

914
02:04:50,591 --> 02:04:51,922
- Mr Vijay Kumar.

915
02:05:12,947 --> 02:05:15,438
But my boss told me that you...

916
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:08,667
And that is... honesty.

917
02:06:31,692 --> 02:06:35,025
That your man brought to me?

918
02:07:02,456 --> 02:07:04,447
...you're wrong, Geeta.

919
02:07:32,753 --> 02:07:35,085
Undoubtedly be made...

920
02:07:57,111 --> 02:08:00,103
with my mother's name.

921
02:08:33,948 --> 02:08:37,145
Has he gone crazy, then?

922
02:09:04,178 --> 02:09:06,578
Why he's doing this!

923
02:09:13,801 --> 02:09:16,861
In this colony, Mr Gupta!

924
02:09:17,238 --> 02:09:19,468
To us, Mr Gupta.

925
02:09:19,874 --> 02:09:23,469
At stake in this colony, Mr Mehra!

926
02:09:23,744 --> 02:09:25,075
Who's taking the risk!

927
02:09:25,479 --> 02:09:28,880
Earlier... and earned in millions!

928
02:09:29,416 --> 02:09:33,477
To blow it up in one day!

929
02:09:33,754 --> 02:09:37,417
But please return our money to us.

930
02:09:37,758 --> 02:09:39,089
I spoke so much...

931
02:09:41,762 --> 02:09:45,755
business relations we have shared.

932
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:49,094
Fiinancial problem.

933
02:09:51,105 --> 02:09:55,769
Get your money tomorrow.

934
02:09:57,511 --> 02:09:59,502
To them tomorrow.

935
02:09:59,647 --> 02:10:01,638
We must leave now, Mr Gupta.

936
02:10:11,525 --> 02:10:13,516
- I know it, Sinha...

937
02:10:15,129 --> 02:10:17,120
funds in the bank.

938
02:10:18,532 --> 02:10:21,126
To send the money immediately.

939
02:10:21,802 --> 02:10:23,793
This morning, sir.

940
02:10:24,538 --> 02:10:26,529
His money back, too.

941
02:10:30,811 --> 02:10:32,802
Mr Jamnadas, too?!

942
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:38,541
Do you see that?

943
02:10:41,155 --> 02:10:42,144
Followed me around...

944
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:47,150
money they had brought!

945
02:10:48,562 --> 02:10:50,154
A diffiicult patch...

946
02:10:50,564 --> 02:10:52,555
their true colours!

947
02:10:54,168 --> 02:10:55,965
Why blame them, sir?

948
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:58,162
Colony or have supplied material...

949
02:11:00,574 --> 02:11:02,166
or bricks, etc....

950
02:11:02,576 --> 02:11:05,170
for their dues.

951
02:11:08,849 --> 02:11:10,180
Rats are the fiirst...

952
02:11:11,852 --> 02:11:15,845
...to desert a sinking ship.

953
02:11:17,191 --> 02:11:18,180
Don't realise...

954
02:11:20,194 --> 02:11:22,185
...that I'm no sinking ship!

955
02:11:23,197 --> 02:11:25,188
In their faces!

956
02:11:25,866 --> 02:11:29,199
We can from the market.

957
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:34,603
This house, too.

958
02:11:35,376 --> 02:11:38,209
However you do it, Mehta...

959
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:42,212
and promissory notes...

960
02:11:43,617 --> 02:11:49,613
...which bear Mr Gupta's signature

961
02:12:16,917 --> 02:12:19,647
- It's a lakh and a half.

962
02:12:22,923 --> 02:12:24,914
Just wait and watch...

963
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:29,252
for Vijay...

964
02:12:30,931 --> 02:12:35,265
fiissful of it from the market.

965
02:12:37,671 --> 02:12:39,662
But tell me something, Mr Gupta.

966
02:12:41,275 --> 02:12:44,267
In a round-about manner?

967
02:12:45,946 --> 02:12:47,937
I have the men, sir...

968
02:12:48,682 --> 02:12:54,279
river, with a stone around his neck.

969
02:12:55,689 --> 02:12:57,680
Fiind his corpse.

970
02:13:00,694 --> 02:13:03,959
No, Balwant. That is not necessary.

971
02:13:04,698 --> 02:13:10,295
It's enough for me to prevent Vijay

972
02:13:11,705 --> 02:13:16,301
Constructions shut down.

973
02:13:16,977 --> 02:13:19,309
Shortage of cement in the market?

974
02:13:21,315 --> 02:13:24,307
The agency for cement.

975
02:13:27,721 --> 02:13:30,315
His stocks in his godowns.

976
02:13:31,725 --> 02:13:33,317
At black-market rates...

977
02:13:33,727 --> 02:13:37,720
to us even at increased prices.

978
02:13:39,333 --> 02:13:41,324
We do have some stocks.

979
02:13:41,735 --> 02:13:42,997
But if the situation continues...

980
02:13:43,737 --> 02:13:46,729
on a couple of buildings.

981
02:13:48,342 --> 02:13:52,005
Never stop our work!

982
02:13:53,347 --> 02:13:55,338
Whom are you calling?

983
02:14:07,761 --> 02:14:09,353
I want to report to you...

984
02:14:09,763 --> 02:14:12,357
in black-market of cement.

985
02:14:13,367 --> 02:14:15,358
His name is Balwant Rai.

986
02:14:23,777 --> 02:14:25,768
All my godowns are sealed!

987
02:14:26,380 --> 02:14:28,371
My stocks have been confiiscated!

988
02:14:29,049 --> 02:14:31,040
The police are looking for me!

989
02:14:31,785 --> 02:14:35,778
For all this, Bhandari!

990
02:14:37,057 --> 02:14:39,048
Now that he has ruined me...

991
02:14:40,394 --> 02:14:42,385
I will not spare him either!

992
02:14:42,829 --> 02:14:44,888
Everything for you.

993
02:14:45,799 --> 02:14:47,391
And you possess nothing!

994
02:14:48,402 --> 02:14:51,803
Everything for your sake.

995
02:14:53,073 --> 02:14:54,404
I respect her sentiments...

996
02:14:55,409 --> 02:14:56,398
who are not slaves to wealth...

997
02:14:59,413 --> 02:15:00,402
...but who heed the heart.

998
02:15:02,416 --> 02:15:04,407
Bubbly is one of them.

999
02:15:06,086 --> 02:15:07,417
Tomorrow morning.

1000
02:15:08,088 --> 02:15:10,818
Solemnise your wedding.

1001
02:15:29,843 --> 02:15:33,108
With the suitcase in hand?

1002
02:15:34,848 --> 02:15:36,839
What are you up to?

1003
02:15:38,852 --> 02:15:40,843
What is it? Tell me.

1004
02:15:41,855 --> 02:15:43,846
I'm walking out of this house.

1005
02:15:47,861 --> 02:15:49,453
You can't be so childish.

1006
02:15:51,131 --> 02:15:52,120
Have to stop me...

1007
02:15:53,133 --> 02:15:55,863
although you're my brother!

1008
02:15:56,136 --> 02:15:59,469
Who immediately agreed to help me.

1009
02:16:01,875 --> 02:16:04,469
Agreed to help you?

1010
02:16:04,878 --> 02:16:06,869
Mr Vijay has promised me that...

1011
02:16:09,483 --> 02:16:13,146
family matters with outsiders!

1012
02:16:13,887 --> 02:16:17,152
Get in... Come on!

1013
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,492
- Get into your room!

1014
02:16:24,898 --> 02:16:27,492
If you step out!

1015
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:32,502
Kumar a visit today!

1016
02:16:43,016 --> 02:16:46,008
With you, Mr Vijay Kumar.

1017
02:16:47,521 --> 02:16:48,510
Come in.

1018
02:16:49,189 --> 02:16:51,521
What I want to tell you.

1019
02:16:52,926 --> 02:16:54,917
Come on out.

1020
02:18:31,024 --> 02:18:32,616
- Move aside, Geeta!

1021
02:18:33,293 --> 02:18:34,624
A man's patience!

1022
02:18:35,295 --> 02:18:37,627
Several times in business!

1023
02:18:38,031 --> 02:18:40,431
Between Sheetal and me!

1024
02:18:41,034 --> 02:18:43,127
He could do to our family!

1025
02:18:43,637 --> 02:18:46,128
Without retaliating even once!

1026
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:51,639
Tolerate what he has done!

1027
02:18:52,646 --> 02:18:56,309
What harm have we done to him?!

1028
02:18:57,317 --> 02:18:58,648
Against you...

1029
02:18:59,319 --> 02:19:00,308
you have done to me...

1030
02:19:01,321 --> 02:19:03,186
...go and question your father!

1031
02:19:04,324 --> 02:19:08,158
To see today, Shekhar.

1032
02:19:09,329 --> 02:19:10,660
Not have minded...

1033
02:19:11,665 --> 02:19:15,658
Bubbly is Vijay's sister, too.

1034
02:19:17,337 --> 02:19:21,671
Vijay is your brother.

1035
02:20:02,716 --> 02:20:04,707
What's the matter?

1036
02:20:05,118 --> 02:20:07,712
Going at his hour?

1037
02:20:10,123 --> 02:20:12,387
We're leaving this house, Daddy.

1038
02:20:12,459 --> 02:20:15,121
What is all this about?

1039
02:20:22,402 --> 02:20:26,736
Nor which you can bear to hear.

1040
02:20:28,408 --> 02:20:31,138
Without any discussion.

1041
02:20:34,147 --> 02:20:36,138
Bubbly is leaving with me.

1042
02:20:37,417 --> 02:20:40,750
As she wants to.

1043
02:20:42,756 --> 02:20:45,748
Choose her companion for life.

1044
02:20:50,764 --> 02:20:53,164
Before you leave.

1045
02:20:54,167 --> 02:20:55,759
This house in this manner...

1046
02:20:57,437 --> 02:20:59,769
be allowed to return.

1047
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:03,170
To this house anymore!

1048
02:21:06,179 --> 02:21:09,171
In this house all these days.

1049
02:21:11,785 --> 02:21:12,774
When I think of it...

1050
02:21:14,454 --> 02:21:17,446
enjoy the luxuries in this family?

1051
02:21:19,793 --> 02:21:23,194
This house to return.

1052
02:21:23,597 --> 02:21:25,588
Let's go.

1053
02:21:34,808 --> 02:21:36,799
Can I leave now, Vijay?

1054
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:41,470
Please stay for some more time.

1055
02:21:42,816 --> 02:21:44,807
I'm feeling very uneasy.

1056
02:21:46,486 --> 02:21:50,479
Even more lonely.

1057
02:21:53,226 --> 02:21:55,217
To be a loner.

1058
02:21:56,496 --> 02:22:00,227
Only on hatred and malice.

1059
02:22:02,235 --> 02:22:08,231
For her love and affection...

1060
02:22:12,245 --> 02:22:17,239
and affection...

1061
02:22:19,252 --> 02:22:21,243
...from you today, Geeta.

1062
02:23:01,294 --> 02:23:03,285
Married tomorrow.

1063
02:23:04,898 --> 02:23:06,889
In the ceremony.

1064
02:23:09,302 --> 02:23:13,295
His house and against his wishes.

1065
02:23:16,309 --> 02:23:17,571
Tell you is that...

1066
02:23:18,311 --> 02:23:20,302
attend the wedding tomorrow.

1067
02:23:23,316 --> 02:23:27,912
Because, in the father's absence...

1068
02:23:29,923 --> 02:23:33,586
who gives away the bride.

1069
02:23:37,597 --> 02:23:41,431
I will... I will certainly come.

1070
02:23:43,603 --> 02:23:45,594
I will...

1071
02:23:54,447 --> 02:23:58,941
Many congratulations to you!

1072
02:24:01,955 --> 02:24:03,946
In my wounds, have you?

1073
02:24:04,624 --> 02:24:06,956
Has given you the wounds...

1074
02:24:08,962 --> 02:24:11,362
in them, too.

1075
02:24:13,967 --> 02:24:14,956
Wife, your son and your daughter...

1076
02:24:18,371 --> 02:24:20,362
at this moment.

1077
02:24:23,977 --> 02:24:25,968
With Vijay Kumar?

1078
02:24:28,648 --> 02:24:31,640
Me for that?

1079
02:24:32,485 --> 02:24:33,315
No, sir.

1080
02:24:34,487 --> 02:24:36,978
On your daughter's wedding.

1081
02:24:37,991 --> 02:24:39,982
By Vijay Kumar himself.

1082
02:24:41,394 --> 02:24:42,986
Bhandari has brought news that...

1083
02:24:43,797 --> 02:24:48,666
your daughter as bride tomorrow.

1084
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:52,661
I heard of it, too.

1085
02:24:54,007 --> 02:24:58,000
Has cast on your family...

1086
02:24:59,012 --> 02:25:03,415
turned against you!

1087
02:25:04,684 --> 02:25:05,673
Of my daughter's wedding...

1088
02:25:06,686 --> 02:25:08,677
...while I'm still alive?

1089
02:25:09,422 --> 02:25:11,413
While I'm still around?

1090
02:25:12,025 --> 02:25:13,014
I know what he's getting at!

1091
02:25:14,027 --> 02:25:16,018
To humiliate me!

1092
02:25:17,030 --> 02:25:19,692
Not at any cost!

1093
02:25:21,701 --> 02:25:23,692
The costs can be worked out.

1094
02:25:24,704 --> 02:25:27,696
You just need to tell us, Mr Gupta.

1095
02:25:32,045 --> 02:25:36,448
Remove this thorn from my path.

1096
02:25:37,717 --> 02:25:39,708
So... name the price!

1097
02:25:42,722 --> 02:25:44,713
5 lakhs.

1098
02:25:45,058 --> 02:25:48,391
As for Vijay Kumar, he...

1099
02:25:48,461 --> 02:25:52,056
He must not live anymore!

1100
02:25:53,466 --> 02:25:55,457
He won't.

1101
02:25:55,735 --> 02:25:58,067
Rest assured, Mr Gupta...

1102
02:26:01,474 --> 02:26:03,738
not live anymore.

1103
02:26:04,177 --> 02:26:06,168
Here you are.

1104
02:26:10,884 --> 02:26:12,078
And promissory notes...

1105
02:26:13,486 --> 02:26:15,477
...issued by Mr R.K. Gupta.

1106
02:26:16,089 --> 02:26:17,078
With these documents now...

1107
02:26:18,091 --> 02:26:20,753
auctioned in a day!

1108
02:26:37,777 --> 02:26:39,768
Who is that?

1109
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:50,521
You?! How dare you come here?

1110
02:26:51,524 --> 02:26:54,789
What more do you want?

1111
02:26:55,795 --> 02:26:57,786
Of many years!

1112
02:26:58,531 --> 02:27:00,522
For every penny!

1113
02:27:01,134 --> 02:27:03,125
My family life!

1114
02:27:03,536 --> 02:27:06,528
And children have deserted me!

1115
02:27:06,806 --> 02:27:08,797
It was only because of you!

1116
02:27:09,542 --> 02:27:13,535
Don't blame me for your follies.

1117
02:27:14,814 --> 02:27:16,145
Treading the path you chose

1118
02:27:18,151 --> 02:27:22,144
at the end of the journey.

1119
02:27:22,555 --> 02:27:26,651
Which one had I chosen?!

1120
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:29,551
Any of your nonsense!

1121
02:27:29,829 --> 02:27:31,820
Yes. You can't understand this.

1122
02:27:32,165 --> 02:27:33,154
Because this is not business.

1123
02:27:34,167 --> 02:27:38,160
That is not business, Mr. Gupta.

1124
02:27:39,839 --> 02:27:41,170
Never understand the woman...

1125
02:27:42,575 --> 02:27:44,167
and her affection...

1126
02:27:45,578 --> 02:27:47,842
wasn't business.

1127
02:27:50,583 --> 02:27:52,574
Who are you talking about?

1128
02:27:53,186 --> 02:27:58,852
I'm talking about Shanti.

1129
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:02,193
Of your life...

1130
02:28:03,863 --> 02:28:05,854
a counterfeit coin.

1131
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,194
You used...

1132
02:28:09,202 --> 02:28:11,193
...as a ladder to your success!

1133
02:28:12,605 --> 02:28:14,197
I talk about...

1134
02:28:14,607 --> 02:28:16,199
to ask why you did that to her...

1135
02:28:17,710 --> 02:28:19,701
have to wrong her?!

1136
02:28:20,613 --> 02:28:23,605
About, Mr R.K. Gupta!

1137
02:28:25,885 --> 02:28:27,876
But how do you know of all this?

1138
02:28:29,889 --> 02:28:31,880
Mr R.K. Gupta.

1139
02:28:35,228 --> 02:28:39,221
The anguish in her heart...

1140
02:28:41,234 --> 02:28:43,896
the bad-name she got...

1141
02:28:44,904 --> 02:28:47,236
and the tatters she lived in...

1142
02:28:48,908 --> 02:28:52,639
And I remember it, too.

1143
02:28:54,914 --> 02:28:56,905
You had killed her soul.

1144
02:28:57,650 --> 02:28:59,914
Only 25 years later.

1145
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:03,912
Still rages in my heart...

1146
02:29:04,257 --> 02:29:08,250
cursed Shanti's son...

1147
02:29:09,262 --> 02:29:11,662
illegitimate father!

1148
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:19,261
Natural justice.

1149
02:29:20,673 --> 02:29:23,267
In consideration of wealth...

1150
02:29:24,277 --> 02:29:26,268
has deserted you today!

1151
02:29:26,946 --> 02:29:30,279
Here's all your wealth.

1152
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:34,943
But poverty and shame.

1153
02:29:36,289 --> 02:29:38,280
Of my mother...

1154
02:29:39,959 --> 02:29:41,950
...return all your wealth to you.

1155
02:29:48,968 --> 02:29:50,959
You have all your wealth today.

1156
02:29:51,971 --> 02:29:54,701
Poorer man in my life!

1157
02:30:29,008 --> 02:30:30,339
- He's not in.

1158
02:30:31,744 --> 02:30:33,735
But there's a message for you.

1159
02:30:34,013 --> 02:30:35,002
By 10 tonight...

1160
02:30:36,015 --> 02:30:38,006
...your job will be completed.

1161
02:30:49,362 --> 02:30:50,351
Who are you?

1162
02:30:51,364 --> 02:30:54,765
Let's go!

1163
02:30:55,434 --> 02:30:57,425
Have you sent someone, Mom?

1164
02:30:57,770 --> 02:31:00,762
I told him several times.

1165
02:31:01,374 --> 02:31:04,036
There's no sign of the groom.

1166
02:31:04,377 --> 02:31:07,039
No sense of responsibility!

1167
02:31:16,189 --> 02:31:18,384
In our custody.

1168
02:31:19,058 --> 02:31:20,389
Safe and sound...

1169
02:31:22,395 --> 02:31:28,197
take him away from Pragati Maidan.

1170
02:31:28,467 --> 02:31:31,402
To talk like this?

1171
02:31:31,571 --> 02:31:34,199
In killing Ravi!

1172
02:31:35,074 --> 02:31:36,405
So just go and tell Vijay Kumar...

1173
02:31:37,410 --> 02:31:38,399
to save your fiiance...

1174
02:31:40,079 --> 02:31:42,070
...he must rush here immediately.

1175
02:31:42,415 --> 02:31:46,078
Of reporting this to the police!

1176
02:31:47,086 --> 02:31:48,417
Out of nervousness...

1177
02:31:49,088 --> 02:31:51,079
without any reason.

1178
02:31:52,091 --> 02:31:57,085
Only for Vijay Kumar's ears.

1179
02:32:01,834 --> 02:32:03,825
Brother!

1180
02:32:13,446 --> 02:32:15,846
Take him there, Gangu.

1181
02:32:16,249 --> 02:32:19,844
You married to Ravi.

1182
02:32:21,454 --> 02:32:22,443
By calling me brother today...

1183
02:32:23,456 --> 02:32:25,447
...you have sanctifiied my oath.

1184
02:32:26,859 --> 02:32:30,124
Do any harm to Ravi!

1185
02:33:00,159 --> 02:33:02,150
This is perhaps my punishment.

1186
02:33:03,496 --> 02:33:05,487
I want to apologise to you today...

1187
02:33:07,166 --> 02:33:11,159
to grant me pardon.

1188
02:33:11,504 --> 02:33:16,498
Like a blind man?

1189
02:33:18,911 --> 02:33:25,180
Sent your son... my son...

1190
02:33:27,186 --> 02:33:29,177
...into the jaws of death!

1191
02:33:32,191 --> 02:33:34,182
But I give you my word, Shanti...

1192
02:33:36,195 --> 02:33:40,529
That is a promise.

1193
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:47,531
Forgive me...

1194
02:33:50,209 --> 02:33:52,200
...please forgive me.

1195
02:34:27,976 --> 02:34:29,568
I have arrived!

1196
02:34:29,978 --> 02:34:33,243
One smart move from you...

1197
02:34:34,983 --> 02:34:37,247
his brains apart!

1198
02:34:39,254 --> 02:34:42,587
And quietly come down.

1199
02:34:56,405 --> 02:34:58,396
That's more like it.

1200
02:35:00,275 --> 02:35:04,609
How's your business coming along?

1201
02:35:06,615 --> 02:35:10,016
Fulfiill your condition.

1202
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:15,283
- Sure, I'll let him go.

1203
02:35:18,026 --> 02:35:20,620
My scores with you.

1204
02:35:23,132 --> 02:35:25,123
No! You can't do that!

1205
02:35:26,034 --> 02:35:27,626
Your hand...

1206
02:35:29,304 --> 02:35:33,297
through Ravi's head! Get it?

1207
02:35:34,843 --> 02:35:38,301
You landed me the other day.

1208
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:45,042
On the slap you gave me.

1209
02:35:46,321 --> 02:35:49,654
Iosing your temper today?

1210
02:35:49,825 --> 02:35:52,157
Silently, aren't you?

1211
02:35:54,329 --> 02:35:59,323
Let Ravi go.

1212
02:36:02,671 --> 02:36:07,665
Of course, I'll let him go.

1213
02:38:22,210 --> 02:38:25,202
Tie them up! I'll fiix them!

1214
02:38:32,821 --> 02:38:36,222
You are late.

1215
02:38:37,492 --> 02:38:41,223
There he is.

1216
02:38:50,505 --> 02:38:53,838
Shekhar here, too, isn't it?

1217
02:38:54,843 --> 02:38:56,834
So was I.

1218
02:38:57,245 --> 02:38:58,837
Cast on your son...

1219
02:38:59,848 --> 02:39:01,839
defend him so much.

1220
02:39:02,851 --> 02:39:06,514
Set your son free.

1221
02:39:09,257 --> 02:39:11,851
Let me have the briefcase.

1222
02:39:13,528 --> 02:39:15,519
It's 5 lakhs, isn't it?

1223
02:39:40,555 --> 02:39:41,544
What are you doing, Daddy?!

1224
02:39:42,557 --> 02:39:44,548
You ought to untie Vijay fiirst!

1225
02:39:44,893 --> 02:39:46,884
You don't know...

1226
02:39:47,295 --> 02:39:49,286
I know everything!

1227
02:39:53,635 --> 02:39:55,626
Grab him!

1228
02:40:25,934 --> 02:40:29,927
For 5 lakh Rupees.

1229
02:40:31,339 --> 02:40:35,605
The right to kill him.

1230
02:40:36,945 --> 02:40:40,608
I denied you the pleasure?

1231
02:40:41,616 --> 02:40:43,948
Here you are... the revolver.

1232
02:40:45,353 --> 02:40:47,344
And there is Vijay.

1233
02:40:47,956 --> 02:40:52,120
Squeezing the trigger at your target.

1234
02:40:55,363 --> 02:41:00,767
Have such sympathy for Vijay?

1235
02:41:01,336 --> 02:41:03,964
Don't know the fact...

1236
02:41:05,974 --> 02:41:08,966
...that Vijay is my son.

1237
02:41:10,378 --> 02:41:12,369
Vijay is my son!

1238
02:41:13,982 --> 02:41:18,976
Back home with me.

1239
02:41:20,388 --> 02:41:22,982
By the police.

1240
02:41:24,993 --> 02:41:29,396
Are you in your senses?!

1241
02:41:30,398 --> 02:41:34,391
That I have come to my senses.

1242
02:41:34,803 --> 02:41:37,499
I'm proud of you, Daddy.

1243
02:41:38,673 --> 02:41:41,403
Set your brother free, Shekhar.

1244
02:41:47,015 --> 02:41:50,678
Urge to embrace Vijay as your son.

1245
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:55,421
Without having my revenge.

1246
02:41:56,424 --> 02:42:01,020
Move from where you stand.

1247
02:42:04,699 --> 02:42:07,429
My son...

1248
02:42:10,438 --> 02:42:12,030
- Daddy!

1249
02:42:23,718 --> 02:42:25,709
Beat them up!

1250
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:52,469
What... have you done?!

1251
02:42:54,082 --> 02:42:55,071
To the hospital!

1252
02:42:56,084 --> 02:42:58,746
That much of time!

1253
02:42:59,087 --> 02:43:02,079
You've lost a lot of blood.

1254
02:43:02,757 --> 02:43:04,748
Let the blood flow, my son...

1255
02:43:05,093 --> 02:43:09,086
wash away my sins.

1256
02:43:11,499 --> 02:43:16,095
I am responsible to you, my son.

1257
02:43:17,772 --> 02:43:19,103
But my sins must not cloud...

1258
02:43:20,775 --> 02:43:24,768
...your relationship with Shekhar.

1259
02:43:27,515 --> 02:43:31,918
Seek your forgiveness, my son.

1260
02:43:33,121 --> 02:43:35,112
But...

1261
02:43:37,525 --> 02:43:42,121
...do forgive me, if you can...
