1
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:39,189
Well, I prefer movies
that make me forget

2
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,791
about the problems
with the world.

3
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:42,926
Come on, Yaar.

4
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:44,458
I mean, "Bol" is a brave movie.

5
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:45,834
It had to be made.

6
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,066
And you know all the students
in the union

7
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,870
are just raving about it.

8
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:27,240
Bravo, son!

9
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,528
Uncle, your medicine.

10
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:44,027
Damn good bootlegger, yeah?

11
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:58,047
This divine music...

12
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,574
Sweetens the sting of death.

13
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:04,754
How many people are there?

14
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,350
What are you doing?

15
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:41,461
Get off me!

16
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:52,803
Don't hurt him!

17
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,932
Is there anyone to help me?

18
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,700
Please, don't go.

19
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:48,755
- All okay, son?
- Absolutely.

20
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,055
Jamal, salaam.

21
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,249
Hello, Mr. Bobby.

22
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:05,235
Alissa?

23
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,006
It's Bobby calling from Lahore.

24
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:11,276
Listen...

25
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:14,947
Something's happened.

26
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,904
Cooper...

27
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:38,002
We've got something.

28
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:46,381
We have sound?

29
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,247
I'm a professor.

30
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,985
I'm a professor.
I didn't do anything.

31
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,434
Please...

32
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,136
Please, don't kill me.

33
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:10,843
Please, don't kill me.

34
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,245
I didn't do anything.

35
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,113
This won't help you.

36
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:18,552
Please, don't...

37
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:19,681
That's all.

38
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:23,661
Let's do our own checking
at the university.

39
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,492
Get CTC on the line, please.

40
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,891
They sent a tape.

41
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:11,372
This place has the best tea
in Lahore.

42
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,705
And do you take sugar, Bobby?

43
00:10:12,743 --> 00:10:13,801
No, thank you.

44
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,686
Well, you have waited
a very long time

45
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,188
for this interview,
and for that,

46
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,383
I must apologize.

47
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,587
Oh, I'm just glad we
could finally do it.

48
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,720
I finally felt the time was right.

49
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,631
Do you mind if I record?

50
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,158
Let's enjoy our tea for
a moment, please.

51
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,837
Oh, I loved your early work.

52
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,809
Your book on Massoud
fighting the Taliban...

53
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,209
great stuff.

54
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,645
I'm still trying to figure out
who wrote the other two.

55
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,773
Oh, thank you.

56
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm flattered that you read them.

57
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,347
Nobody move!

58
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,118
Stay calm.

59
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,227
- What's this?
- Shall we take them in?

60
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:03,992
Sir, the police are here.

61
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,328
Get up!

62
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,458
Search him.

63
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:10,363
Enough.

64
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,668
Catch that boy!

65
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,581
They seem a little edgy.

66
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,553
Our police become
very animated

67
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,647
when it's an American
that's been kidnapped.

68
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,817
You teach at the same
university as Anse Rainier.

69
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:30,951
I do.

70
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,586
Don't you think he's
worth looking for?

71
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,620
By roughing up people who
had nothing to do with it?

72
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,427
I've heard the group
taking responsibility

73
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,524
recruits here.

74
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:38,693
What makes you so sure

75
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:39,929
they had nothing to do with it?

76
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:42,062
They're my students.

77
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:45,734
And they're innocent
until proven otherwise.

78
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,709
I learned that from CSI: Miami.

79
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,971
Yeah.

80
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,072
Hmm.

81
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,848
Do you think he's still alive?

82
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,689
So tell me, Bobby,

83
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,427
what exactly is the article about?

84
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,367
Well, I'm still working on it,

85
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:14,736
but so far the logline is,

86
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,900
"Pakistan's New Militant Academia. "

87
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,706
Am I part of the new
militant academia?

88
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,211
I don't know.

89
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:22,372
Are you?

90
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,120
You know, the answer
to that question

91
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:32,455
may challenge some of
your preconceived notions.

92
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:33,789
Changez, I'm a journalist.

93
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,295
Generally, we try to avoid
preconceived notions.

94
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,456
But of course.

95
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:38,794
- You mind if I...
- Yes.

96
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,800
I only ask one thing.

97
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,302
That you please listen
to the whole story

98
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:44,326
from the very beginning,

99
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:46,168
not just bits and pieces.

100
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:48,738
Do I have your word?

101
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:49,833
You do.

102
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:56,481
Looks can be deceiving.

103
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,583
I am a lover of America.

104
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,892
Although I was raised to feel
very Pakistani.

105
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:09,787
After all, the blood of princes
runs in my veins.

106
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,465
Perhaps that's an exaggeration.

107
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,766
Let's say the princes and I
moved in the same circles.

108
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,003
We attended the same schools...

109
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,541
Lived in the same neighborhoods.

110
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:27,713
But all of a sudden,
there were new princes in town.

111
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:30,040
Hey, Chingu!

112
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,055
Buy a new car.

113
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:34,887
Time to junk your oxcart.

114
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,650
Yes, we still had the prestige

115
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:39,424
of a Punjab Club membership...

116
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:40,828
Abu, we need a new car.

117
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:43,129
But our bank account was empty.

118
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,692
And retire this magnificent chariot?

119
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:46,964
Nonsense.

120
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:50,201
These new-money scoundrels
are ruining the place.

121
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,036
Your Bina madam's waiting.

122
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,627
Bond!

123
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:12,995
What vulgar clothes.

124
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:16,263
No one will marry you.

125
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,599
Ammi, please.

126
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,264
I'm the Bond girl.

127
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,772
It's no joke.

128
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,866
They're lining up.

129
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:25,469
Go, work in India.

130
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:26,842
There, anything goes.

131
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,081
"Though memories fade,

132
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:33,017
"may Allah never free you

133
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:37,514
from my love. "

134
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:42,863
Changez, remember,
your father's a poet.

135
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:44,091
Sing for us.

136
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,121
Mm-mm.

137
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,361
He doesn't want to sing
those songs anymore, Ajju.

138
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:49,393
He's an American now.

139
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,166
Va, va, va, va...

140
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,973
Listen, son.

141
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,873
He fusses over you
because he loves you.

142
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,180
You know that, right?

143
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:05,311
Cigarette?

144
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,082
Poems don't buy generators.

145
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,683
Somebody has to be
where the money is.

146
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:13,287
Hey, Chingu,
take me to New York with you.

147
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,662
I could be the dazzling
new ethnic friend

148
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,462
on Sex and the City
or something.

149
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,264
But, Chan, what about
your Mr. Bond?

150
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:21,770
Oh, please.
Bond?

151
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:24,239
I'd drop him in a second
for Mr. Big.

152
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,742
All I want is a loft in SoHo,

153
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:28,369
weekend in the Hamptons,

154
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:33,315
and a pair of big,
fake American boobs.

155
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,284
What? Is that too much to ask?

156
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,808
Not at all.

157
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,515
God bless America.

158
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,925
God bless America, indeed.

159
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:48,158
God bless its level playing fields.

160
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:52,767
God bless winning.

161
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:02,404
See you next Friday.

162
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:23,603
Changes, take a seat.

163
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,302
You have 20 minutes
to convince me

164
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:34,974
that you belong
at Underwood Samson.

165
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,313
Well, I've never gotten a B
in my entire life.

166
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:38,511
Touch wood.

167
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:40,452
And I'm about to graduate
summa cum laude.

168
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:42,320
Good... although I've heard
that line several times today.

169
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:43,949
What else?

170
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:46,223
Well, I also played
varsity soccer

171
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:47,354
four years straight.

172
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,626
I'm glad you got some exercise.

173
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:52,725
Changes, a position at our firm
as a financial analyst

174
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:55,760
is one the most sought-after
jobs in the entire world.

175
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,432
Lift up the hood.

176
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:59,964
Show me what makes you run.

177
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:01,203
Where are you from?

178
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:03,235
Lahore in Pakistan.

179
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:07,677
Are you on financial aid?

180
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,178
Yes, I am.

181
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,016
It's more difficult for
an international student

182
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:13,682
to be accepted at an
Ivy League school

183
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,521
if they apply for aid.

184
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,152
You must have really needed
the money.

185
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:19,856
Yeah, I did.

186
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,365
The accent's great.

187
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,594
Makes you sound like royalty.

188
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,330
How did your rich-kid friends
at Princeton

189
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,668
react to your Horatio Alger story?

190
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,696
Most of them don't even know
where their bootstraps are.

191
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:31,538
You know what, Jim?
We don't really discuss it.

192
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,710
I know you're seeing
a lot of people today, so...

193
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:36,839
Wait.

194
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:42,543
Your friends here
don't even know, do they?

195
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,321
That's interesting.

196
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,056
That's lifting up the hood.

197
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,063
So tell me, Changes,

198
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,564
why did you want to come
to America?

199
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,794
For future reference, Jim,
it's "Changez. "

200
00:17:56,603 --> 00:18:00,061
In America,
I get an equal chance to win.

201
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,097
And whether or not
you hire me, Jim,

202
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:03,632
I am going to win.

203
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,473
Good fucking answer.

204
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,384
Thank you, God!

205
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:23,394
I was a soldier
in your economic army.

206
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:25,730
I worshiped in those
magnificent temples

207
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:27,564
of money and steel

208
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:30,163
where men in tailored suits
control the fate

209
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:33,106
of billion-dollar corporations...

210
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:34,472
men like me.

211
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:39,113
You got skylines like that
back home?

212
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:40,774
You're all smart.

213
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,784
The game changer at
this stage is will.

214
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:44,115
Do you want excellence

215
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:46,279
more than the person
sitting next to you?

216
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:49,416
At Underwood Samson,
we do not get paid for hunches.

217
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,518
The reason why our fees
are higher than any other firm

218
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,427
is because of our unparalleled ability

219
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,364
to not only assess value

220
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:57,492
but to create it in our
clients' businesses.

221
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:02,130
We do that by focusing
on the fundamentals.

222
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:04,766
This is a hypothetical business.

223
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:06,241
Thanks to groundbreaking research,

224
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:09,473
BNUS Transportation,
using 11-foot-tall cylinders,

225
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,538
can teleport travelers
to any destination

226
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,880
in the world instantly.

227
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,715
Buenos Aires to Cairo
in a second and a half.

228
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:18,585
I want you to tell me
what the company is worth.

229
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,318
Information is in your binders.

230
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:22,189
You have one hour.

231
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,321
Okay.

232
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,526
Is he serious?

233
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,745
So that's as per the third quarter.

234
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,412
Please, continue.

235
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,852
And because of these factors,

236
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:52,450
I project the total value
of BNUS at $48 billion

237
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,290
with revenue growing at an
average 52% per annum

238
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,626
for the first two years.

239
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:58,188
I'm not with you
on the growth rate.

240
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,169
Changez,

241
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:03,670
I've got a five-star
safety rating

242
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,036
from A.B. Townes.

243
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,541
My travel cylinders only cost
11 million bucks apiece.

244
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,042
What is your analysis?

245
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,567
Your company is worthless.

246
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:11,600
What?

247
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:15,377
Care to clarify?

248
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,543
Well, A.B. Townes is
all well and good,

249
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:20,383
but if your business
is convincing a mother

250
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:22,389
that you can successfully
disarticulate

251
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:24,016
and then reassemble
all the molecules

252
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,027
in her five-year-old
thousands of miles away,

253
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,825
this technology
is at least a generation away

254
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:29,297
from practical,
widespread usage.

255
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,299
Is that a hunch?

256
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,698
Because you're not getting paid
for hunches.

257
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:33,032
No.
Page 68.

258
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,537
Your own market surveys show

259
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:38,871
72% of your potential travelers
would never use the cylinders

260
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:41,536
no matter how safe you
proved that they were.

261
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:42,977
So I should just pack up
and go home?

262
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,809
No, I'm saying you should
pack other people up

263
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:46,247
and go into shipping.

264
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:47,943
The same... the same
polling suggests

265
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:50,145
that 94% of clients
would be okay

266
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:52,347
with you teleporting
their baggage.

267
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:54,619
So your business isn't travel;
it's shipping...

268
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,626
subcontainer-scale shipping.

269
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,994
Real-world assignments
come in on Monday.

270
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:05,059
Nothing too exciting.

271
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:07,401
Everybody will be disappointed.

272
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,201
Almost everybody.

273
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:18,838
Go, brother.

274
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:19,908
# Let's go #

275
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:22,019
# Uh-huh, yeah, yeah #

276
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:23,213
# Top-level philanderer #

277
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:24,279
# My time in the camera #

278
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:25,619
# Reason why she's smiling #

279
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,125
# 'Cause I'm nice
with the algebra #

280
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,253
# President, I rose to the top
of my class #

281
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:30,592
# Model chick by my side #

282
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,655
# Champagne in the glass #

283
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:32,756
# And she telling me #

284
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,461
# Papi far ahead
in these lanes #

285
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,525
# So such-and-such #

286
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,059
# Should probably
just stop speaking my name #

287
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:38,833
# I'm the boss here,
the king would never... #

288
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:40,169
Toss it, Wainwright.

289
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:43,167
Ow!

290
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,201
Plays out like this.
First, B-school.

291
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:46,974
Second, run my own hedge fund.

292
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,641
Third, philanthropy.

293
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,706
And in 25 years,

294
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,012
I'm gonna be devoted full-time

295
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:52,678
to wiping out malaria.

296
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,983
What if someone takes out
malaria before you get there?

297
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,751
Well, I'll pick the next
available disease

298
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,315
and kick its ass too.

299
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,487
If that lazy fuck Posada
would learn to slide like that,

300
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,498
we'll get another pennant
this year.

301
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,501
Well, unlike you commoners,
I have a law degree.

302
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,469
I'm gonna run a Fortune 500 company

303
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:10,301
until I hit ten digits.

304
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:11,636
What about you, Changeez?

305
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,403
Where do you see
yourself in 25 years?

306
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:16,377
25 years...

307
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:18,346
I'm gonna be the dictator
of an Islamic republic

308
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,371
with nuclear capability.

309
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,813
Anyone want a soda?

310
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,486
No, I'm good...

311
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:32,892
Saddam.

312
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:33,918
He really scared me.

313
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:38,161
Thought he was for serious.
Thank you.

314
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:43,562
Wow.

315
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,040
Ooh!
Whoa!

316
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,243
What the hell was that?

317
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,517
That was Herman.

318
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:58,749
He overshot his gap.

319
00:22:58,789 --> 00:22:59,813
Herman, are you okay?

320
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:01,382
Oh, man.
Yeah, I'm good.

321
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:02,393
You all right?

322
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:03,519
Oh, I hope I got that.

323
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:06,030
Your expression was amazing.

324
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:07,157
You're not hurt, are you?

325
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,997
No, lost a couple of inches of hair,

326
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:11,333
but apart from that...

327
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:12,963
Oh, you know what?
It's a little out of focus.

328
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:15,099
Excuse me!

329
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:16,540
Could you do that again?

330
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,201
Do... do that again?

331
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:20,371
It looks great.

332
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:23,771
Yeah, sure.

333
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,078
Oh, thanks.

334
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:26,779
All right.

335
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,582
Like, one or two feet higher.

336
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:30,521
Come on.
Go fly, Herman.

337
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:32,683
I'll strap my wings on.

338
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:33,886
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:35,395
Is this, like, a magazine
shoot or something?

340
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:36,828
No, no, no.
It's not that official.

341
00:23:36,864 --> 00:23:39,766
I'm just photographing
these guys for a new project.

342
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,564
I wasn't trying
to kill you, so...

343
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:42,865
And I won't kill you.
I promise.

344
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:44,201
We'll see.

345
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,900
In Lahore... in Pakistan,
where I'm from...

346
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:48,273
kids don't fly on skateboards;
they fly kites.

347
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,641
Kites?
Really?

348
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,006
I don't know your name.

349
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:55,243
- Oh, Changez.
- Ah.

350
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:58,047
Stay on your mark, Changez.

351
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,246
Changez.
Changez...

352
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,517
That's right.
Very good.

353
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:03,114
Okay, Herman?

354
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,626
He's coming, isn't he?

355
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,127
He's coming.
I can feel him.

356
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:11,057
- Whoo!
- Sweet, Herman!

357
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:13,466
Great.
Okay.

358
00:24:13,503 --> 00:24:14,800
- Right.
- Sorry, got to run.

359
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:18,138
Is there a way I can...

360
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:20,268
Hey.
You're my William Tell.

361
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,743
You know,
with the apple and the...

362
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:22,745
Right.

363
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:23,905
Shot it.

364
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:25,005
Bye.

365
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,874
Wainwright.

366
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:29,078
Mm!

367
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,111
Couldn't get the number,
could you, Mobutu?

368
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,622
He was right.

369
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:34,988
I'd missed my moment.

370
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:38,727
Here I am rambling on,

371
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:40,390
and I haven't offered you
anything to eat.

372
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:41,398
I'm sorry.

373
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:42,491
Junaid!

374
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:43,660
Yes, Khan, sir.

375
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:46,170
Get us a chicken curry.

376
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:48,537
Dall and two naans.

377
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,405
Okay?

378
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:53,070
A rogani naan for me.

379
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:54,170
Wow.

380
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:56,744
I think I'm growing on him.

381
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,349
Students...

382
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:02,183
The police are here
for your protection.

383
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:03,848
Do not interfere

384
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:07,518
with Professor Rainier's
investigation.

385
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,027
Do not forget,

386
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:14,467
demonstrating and disrupting
the peace is forbidden.

387
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:16,470
We advise you
to return to class

388
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:19,132
and cooperate
with the police.

389
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:23,200
It's serious.
The police are everywhere.

390
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:24,541
Forget them.

391
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:26,205
Poetry is serious too.

392
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:27,771
As Khan sir says...

393
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:31,717
"The most transcendent poetry
is, by definition, political. "

394
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:34,915
So you want poetry
to do the protesting?

395
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:36,889
Why not?

396
00:25:36,924 --> 00:25:38,414
Mm.

397
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:39,653
All well, sir?

398
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:42,219
You're always where
the food is, no?

399
00:25:42,264 --> 00:25:44,129
Why aren't you at home
marking these exams?

400
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,135
Yeah, well...

401
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,228
Ahmad and those guys
wanted me to protest,

402
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:49,295
but you know me.

403
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:50,930
I need lunch
before I can protest.

404
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:53,838
Presenting the militant academic.

405
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,408
Bobby Lincoln, this is my
teaching assistant, Sameer.

406
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:59,415
Watch out.
He knows Urdu.

407
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:01,781
Peace be upon you.

408
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:02,944
And you.

409
00:26:02,985 --> 00:26:04,350
Peace be with you, brothers.

410
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:07,584
Ali, start your protest
so I can go home!

411
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:09,716
So, Bobby, I must ask you.

412
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,991
Why do you think they'd
be harassing my family?

413
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,258
I can't speak for the
American authorities,

414
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:18,769
but I think it's safe to assume

415
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:20,771
they consider you
a person of interest.

416
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:24,206
And they make these decisions
with what evidence?

417
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:27,177
So how do... how do I
become uninteresting?

418
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:34,378
Look, Changez,

419
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:36,387
the kidnapping of an
American citizen

420
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:39,117
is about as heavy
as it gets for them.

421
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:41,819
And I'm sure if you were willing
to go in and talk to them,

422
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,294
they'd probably be able
to help you.

423
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:44,557
You think I had something to do

424
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:47,225
with this kidnapping, Bobby?

425
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:48,790
I'm not the one you
have to convince.

426
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:50,564
Is that the first lie you've
told me today?

427
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:52,231
They've got Asif.

428
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,637
Some things are heating up.

429
00:27:02,716 --> 00:27:04,343
- I know nothing.
- Give us their names!

430
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:09,711
I must warn you, Bobby,

431
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,314
I find it very difficult
to confess all

432
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:13,588
to a man I know so little about.

433
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:15,152
Fair enough.
What do you want to know?

434
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:17,721
Well, what drew you
to our part of the world?

435
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,694
Well, for one thing,

436
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:22,135
it's a hell of a lot
more interesting

437
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:23,536
than Paterson, New Jersey.

438
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,404
"Your nest is not atop the
dome of a royal palace.

439
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:33,744
"Your next is not atop
the dome of a royal palace.

440
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,545
"You are a royal falcon.

441
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:37,779
Build your nest
on a mountain peak. "

442
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:38,808
Wow.

443
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:40,253
Iqbal.

444
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:41,722
So now Lahore is your nest.

445
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:44,555
Been here seven years.

446
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:46,984
Your Urdu is quite good.

447
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:49,563
I've picked some up.

448
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,760
Looks like you picked up a
couple of weights too, huh?

449
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:54,566
You look quite solid
for a journalist.

450
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:55,731
Thank you.

451
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:57,434
Like somebody who could move
very quickly

452
00:27:57,474 --> 00:27:58,805
in the event of an emergency.

453
00:27:58,842 --> 00:28:01,140
I'm not anticipating any
emergencies, are you?

454
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:02,736
The future is very hard to predict.

455
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,341
Oh, not if you're an analyst
from Underwood Samson.

456
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:09,511
Yes. The Navy SEALs
of finance, eh?

457
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:13,819
You know, like the SEALs,
our special talent set us apart.

458
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:16,223
We were catapulted
into privilege.

459
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,887
I felt I was entering
in New York

460
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:19,362
exactly the same social class

461
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,195
my parents were falling out of
in Lahore.

462
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,701
Hey, Underwood's worth it.

463
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,567
I hear his brownstone's worth
$16 million.

464
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:27,197
Well, mozzarella stick,
when I'm CEO

465
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,207
and you're my butler,

466
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,572
you're gonna wear tails.

467
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,099
- Gentlemen.
- All right, all right.

468
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,303
So shall we, gentlemen?

469
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:33,937
- Thank you, good sir.
- You're welcome.

470
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,190
I hear he has a Monet
over the pisser

471
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,590
in the master bathroom.

472
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:56,469
Interesting piece, isn't it?

473
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:57,562
Hello, Mr. Underwood.

474
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:58,572
Thank you for having me.

475
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,096
Changez.

476
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:03,304
The artist is having her
first solo show very soon.

477
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:05,710
I advise getting in early.

478
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:06,907
Yes, it's impressive.

479
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:14,655
Oh, my God.

480
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:16,623
You've got to be kidding me.

481
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,127
Actually, Erica,

482
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:22,824
this discerning young man
was just admiring your work.

483
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:24,355
Oh.

484
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
You know him already.

485
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:27,999
My William Tell.

486
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,665
Yes.
He's very courageous.

487
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:31,731
Well, if my niece
is vouching for you,

488
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:34,573
I think Jim Cross
better watch out

489
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:36,340
for his corner office.

490
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:39,510
You drink, Changez?

491
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:40,982
- Yes, I do.
- Good!

492
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:42,746
I had a Pakistani once.

493
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:43,810
He didn't drink.

494
00:29:43,853 --> 00:29:45,252
Oh, Jesus, Uncle Max...

495
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:46,915
What?

496
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:48,514
You got something
for this fellow?

497
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:49,855
Matter of fact, we do.

498
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:51,155
I was just about to talk to him

499
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:53,253
about our project
in the Philippines...

500
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:54,355
auto business.

501
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:55,422
Interested?

502
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,127
- Yes, definitely.
- Good.

503
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:58,726
Well, let me know
about Sunday

504
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:00,202
at the Greenwich house,
my darling.

505
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:01,227
Okay.

506
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:04,306
Bring your friend if you like.

507
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,367
Mm.

508
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,810
Can I borrow you
for a moment?

509
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:10,280
You clean up very nicely.

510
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:11,339
Thank you.

511
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:13,010
I'm sorry about being related

512
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:14,848
to that knucklehead
of an uncle.

513
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:15,910
Oh, go easy on him.

514
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:16,978
It's not easy to grow up

515
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:18,387
in the slums of Connecticut,
right?

516
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:19,447
No.

517
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,754
Erica, darling!
Oh!

518
00:30:22,794 --> 00:30:25,855
You know,
I knew a Pakistani once,

519
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:28,696
and he saved me from small talk
at a Wall Street party.

520
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:30,703
Really?
Did he drink, though?

521
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:32,034
Because I hear they don't drink.

522
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:42,143
# I want you to be #

523
00:30:42,182 --> 00:30:45,845
# I want you #

524
00:30:48,422 --> 00:30:50,413
# So this is... #

525
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,726
Your father is a poet.

526
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,695
- Yes.
- I don't believe you.

527
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,391
- Why would I make that up?
- Unbelievable.

528
00:30:57,432 --> 00:30:58,729
You know how often I dream

529
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,792
of having a family full of poets?

530
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,803
What?

531
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:04,635
No, I'm serious.

532
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:06,868
Is he published?

533
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,238
Yeah.

534
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,975
His laser-sharp words
and his inadequate salary

535
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:15,381
are well known
throughout the Punjab.

536
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:16,578
Wow.

537
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:23,351
Who was that guy jumping
in your painting?

538
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,791
My boyfriend, Chris.

539
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:31,667
Is he... is that your
current boyfriend?

540
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:35,434
He died 23 weeks ago.

541
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,073
We grew up together.

542
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:46,110
Wow.
I'm sorry.

543
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:50,716
My friends keep saying,
you know, "Turn the page. "

544
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:51,881
"Lift the black veil. "

545
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:53,049
And it's just...

546
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:57,159
I wish it was that easy.

547
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:02,299
People back home have
this thing called iddat.

548
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:04,802
It's like, um... it's like the period

549
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:08,296
that a woman is allowed
to mourn her husband.

550
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:09,899
But she's only allowed
to mourn him

551
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:12,741
for four months
and ten days.

552
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,007
And then it's over?

553
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:16,277
Mm-hmm.

554
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,614
Right.

555
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:19,811
That'd be nice.

556
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,551
It's okay to turn the corner.

557
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:28,561
You're already two months
into overtime.

558
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:32,857
I don't mean to be flippant.

559
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,925
No, no, no, no, no.

560
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:36,766
It's good.
It helps.

561
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:39,272
# I want you to be #

562
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,476
# I want you #

563
00:32:44,513 --> 00:32:48,005
# Come on now,
so sure #

564
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:52,781
# I want you to be #

565
00:32:54,153 --> 00:32:57,543
# I want you to be #

566
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,059
# I want you to be #

567
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:06,595
# I want you to be #

568
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:10,212
# I want you to be #

569
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,282
No, no.

570
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:58,119
Blues originated in West Africa.

571
00:33:58,157 --> 00:33:59,988
Okay, you can say it as
many times as you like...

572
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,720
The blues originated
in West Africa.

573
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:05,924
Actually, I don't really know
what I'm talking about.

574
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:08,298
Look at this.

575
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,633
Okay, so all these pictures of me...

576
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,002
you've got to have
a little crush on me.

577
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:16,602
You have a very
healthy self-esteem.

578
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:17,736
That's good to see.

579
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:19,405
You know what this says to me?

580
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:20,744
This is saying,

581
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:22,749
"Changez, throw a burka on me

582
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:25,081
"and confiscate
my college degree

583
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,747
and take me home to Mama. "

584
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:29,119
Would I have to wear a burka?

585
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,723
You look so serious.

586
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:36,821
Oh, my God.
Get out.

587
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:38,331
- What?
- Don't do that.

588
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:40,232
Don't make fun of me.
- "Do I have to wear a burka?"

589
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:41,963
How am I making fun of you?
What?

590
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,280
You know...

591
00:34:56,786 --> 00:35:01,587
After you told me stories
about Lahore,

592
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:05,526
I kept hearing your voice
afterwards.

593
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,655
You know, I don't recognize
my own voice anymore.

594
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:13,800
It sounds all tinny and fake,

595
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:15,668
like someone who doesn't
come from anywhere.

596
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:21,034
You sound real to me.

597
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:10,090
Oh, God...

598
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,620
I feel like I'm cheating.

599
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:22,506
Should we stop?

600
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,867
Oh, I want to.

601
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:50,839
I want to, but I can't.

602
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,776
Pretend I'm him.

603
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,470
Oh, Manila, Manila.

604
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:01,709
Hide your virgins

605
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,808
and your extra layers
of middle management,

606
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,911
'cause we're not here
to play.

607
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:12,085
- Welcome.
- Good morning.

608
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:14,026
Changez Khan from New York.

609
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:24,431
We had one goal:

610
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,997
to figure out
how much profit

611
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,306
this company
could really throw off.

612
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:33,271
How do you squeeze
more productivity

613
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:38,185
out of a company that pays
its workers 5 bucks a day?

614
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:39,711
I think the fat is there.

615
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:44,057
Let me get this straight.

616
00:38:46,663 --> 00:38:48,426
You're saying that they
can effectively lose

617
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,898
1/4 of their workforce?

618
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:51,730
- 1/3.
- 1/3 is a big chunk.

619
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:54,567
I'd feel more comfortable
shooting for a 15% reduction.

620
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:55,902
May I?

621
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,998
Please.

622
00:38:57,975 --> 00:39:00,842
Okay, so this entire sector

623
00:39:00,878 --> 00:39:02,847
is devoted to fixing mistakes
that they make

624
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:04,041
on the assembly line.

625
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:06,209
I say, let's get in a team
from Japan

626
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:07,878
and fix the line.

627
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,047
Then we can get the
current error rate of 11%

628
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:12,989
down to industry standard,
which is 4% to 5%.

629
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:17,018
Then this entire crew
becomes completely superfluous.

630
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,427
Boy, that's brutal.

631
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:23,456
That's too aggressive.

632
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:25,698
That line is already
at capacity.

633
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,406
I want to put together
a team of consultants...

634
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:33,708
the best, ex-Toyota maybe.

635
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,908
I want them here soon...
like tomorrow.

636
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,042
Done.

637
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,714
You have a gift for this,

638
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,725
a very lucrative gift.

639
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:46,783
Please.

640
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:52,860
I have a theory about those
who have the gift.

641
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,460
They're outsiders.

642
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:57,528
You and I have a lot more
in common than you think.

643
00:39:57,572 --> 00:39:59,767
I was the first in my family
to go to college.

644
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:04,211
My father was a car salesman.

645
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:06,476
He would come visit me at Harvard

646
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:09,882
with his cheap haircut
and his Payless shoes,

647
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:12,615
and it would make me hungry,

648
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:14,680
hungry to be the best.

649
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:20,855
You're hungry like that too.

650
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,623
So...

651
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,793
Where do you see yourself
in the next ten years?

652
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:32,335
I'd like to be a managing director

653
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:36,472
at Underwood Samson by 30.

654
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:43,179
Why not 27?

655
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:45,655
The first step to becoming
a managing director

656
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,317
is to be made an associate.

657
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:50,217
We'll start laying down
the groundwork

658
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,353
as soon as we get home.

659
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:55,061
Until then,

660
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:57,397
consider this a down payment.

661
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,404
You're a long way
from Lahore, kid.

662
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:02,333
Let's eat.

663
00:41:53,662 --> 00:41:55,789
Um, I... I don't know
which tower it hit,

664
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:57,458
but it hit directly in the middle

665
00:41:57,499 --> 00:42:00,491
of one of the World
Trade Center towers.

666
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:01,934
Sean, what kind of plane?

667
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,268
Was it a small plane, a jet?

668
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:04,671
It was a jet.

669
00:42:04,707 --> 00:42:09,610
It looked a two-engine jet,
you know, maybe a 737.

670
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:11,510
We are talking about
a large passenger jet.

671
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:14,016
A large passenger commercial jet,
that's right.

672
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:15,040
And where were...

673
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:16,177
Oh, my God!

674
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,687
- Oh...
- Oh, my God.

675
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:20,121
That looks like
a second plane.

676
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:21,454
Now it's obvious,
I think...

677
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:22,891
Right now, we can recap
and tell you

678
00:42:22,926 --> 00:42:24,154
that two planes have hit
the towers.

679
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:25,627
It looks like there's
a lot of smoke.

680
00:42:25,662 --> 00:42:27,095
We're still trying
to get information.

681
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:29,099
Police are telling us,
if you're in the area,

682
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:30,998
please get out of the area ASAP.

683
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:32,592
Stay with us as we get
more information.

684
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,035
There was a huge explosion.

685
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:36,199
I can't really see very well
right now,

686
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:38,209
so what I'm trying to do
is just head out...

687
00:42:38,243 --> 00:42:40,404
head over to the
Hudson River, so...

688
00:42:44,616 --> 00:42:47,586
In that moment, I should have
felt sorrow or anger,

689
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,214
but all I felt was awe.

690
00:42:50,256 --> 00:42:52,281
What audacity.

691
00:42:52,324 --> 00:42:53,951
The ruthlessness of the act

692
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:57,485
was surpassed
only by its genius,

693
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,725
that David had struck Goliath.

694
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:07,833
I'm sorry if my reaction
to the attacks

695
00:43:07,874 --> 00:43:08,966
has offended you, Bobby.

696
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:10,909
I hope you see that
I'm not celebrating

697
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:13,640
the death of 3,000 innocents,

698
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,171
just as you would not celebrate
the death of 100,000

699
00:43:16,216 --> 00:43:18,777
in Baghdad or Kabul,
for that matter.

700
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:21,344
But before conscience kicks in,

701
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:26,326
have you never felt a split
second of pleasure

702
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,918
at arrogance brought low?

703
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:39,305
And you ask me why they're
harassing your family?

704
00:43:40,642 --> 00:43:42,837
Let's just cut the bullshit, okay?

705
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:45,438
You believe in violence
as a tool for social change.

706
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,380
You teach a course
in violent revolution

707
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,180
at Lahore University.

708
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:51,710
Your lectures are full
of anti-American rhetoric.

709
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,655
We will wipe the blood of the
invaders from our swords!

710
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:03,864
If that weren't enough,

711
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,061
you were spotted at an
Asal Mujahideen meeting

712
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,162
with Mustafa Fazil,
a known cell leader.

713
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:11,231
I think I can help.

714
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:13,038
I knew you would.

715
00:44:13,077 --> 00:44:15,102
What are you doing?

716
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:17,773
Last night, Anse Rainier
was kidnapped,

717
00:44:17,815 --> 00:44:18,941
and this morning,

718
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:21,009
your class was canceled.

719
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:26,787
If you're just an innocent
bystander, Changez,

720
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:28,087
why were you hiding?

721
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:32,354
Only guilty people hide.

722
00:44:32,397 --> 00:44:34,160
Your candor is appreciated, Bobby,

723
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:35,860
but your conclusions are wrong.

724
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:38,932
See, all this rhetoric such as,

725
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,769
"We will wipe the blood
of the invaders from our sword,"

726
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,002
this is like undercooked meat.

727
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:45,510
It's satisfying
when times are lean,

728
00:44:45,544 --> 00:44:46,738
but if you gorge yourself on it,

729
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:48,110
you will get sick.

730
00:44:49,482 --> 00:44:50,642
Now, I may be an opponent

731
00:44:50,683 --> 00:44:52,241
of American interference in Pakistan

732
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:53,810
but so are many of your
own generals.

733
00:44:55,122 --> 00:44:57,613
Classes on revolution
are taught at Duke.

734
00:44:57,658 --> 00:44:58,955
Are all those professors

735
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:01,017
planning on blowing up
federal buildings?

736
00:45:02,996 --> 00:45:05,294
I did attend a meeting
at the Jamia Madrasah.

737
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:06,959
A madrasah is a place
of learning, Bobby,

738
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,399
and I'm a teacher.

739
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:11,029
My work takes me
to all kinds of places,

740
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:12,869
just as your work
has brought you here.

741
00:45:12,907 --> 00:45:14,465
My thinking
is that knowledge is power,

742
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:17,137
not just religious knowledge but...

743
00:45:17,178 --> 00:45:18,839
You say guilty people hide.

744
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,508
So do people who feel hunted.

745
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:23,847
I missed my lectures for
a much more direct reason.

746
00:45:23,885 --> 00:45:25,854
What the hell is this?

747
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:27,788
They entered my home
and attacked my family.

748
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:29,654
Who did this?

749
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:31,125
A calamity!

750
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,354
Bandy!

751
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:34,796
Who did this to you?

752
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,596
Three agency bastards
showed up.

753
00:45:38,634 --> 00:45:39,931
We have to get you
to a hospital.

754
00:45:39,968 --> 00:45:41,833
Changez, they attack your uncle.

755
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,701
They follow Ammi around
in the Sabzi Mandi.

756
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:46,174
Why this massive campaign
against you?

757
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:48,006
Ammi, this is all going to stop, okay?

758
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:49,534
I promise you.

759
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:52,548
Why do you have to keep giving
these firebrand lectures?

760
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:53,810
And where are you going now?

761
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,249
Stay out of it.

762
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,083
- Keep an eye on him.
- I'll be there.

763
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,987
A few days after my
house was raided...

764
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:04,290
my uncle's shoulder shattered
and his ribs broken...

765
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,228
my office was ransacked.

766
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,070
These are the people
who tore my office apart.

767
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,915
But that shouldn't surprise you,
should it, Bobby?

768
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:38,455
You were there.

769
00:46:47,073 --> 00:46:50,373
I recognized you
from your column.

770
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:51,742
So you're a spook.

771
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:08,754
Shit.

772
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:11,692
Fuck.

773
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:20,565
Is there someplace private
we can talk?

774
00:47:48,538 --> 00:47:49,977
Bobby!

775
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:51,863
Bobby!

776
00:47:52,543 --> 00:47:53,703
What the hell?

777
00:47:57,515 --> 00:47:59,676
Lincoln!

778
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:01,946
Bobby!

779
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:05,119
Get me another frequency.

780
00:48:05,157 --> 00:48:07,625
Bobby, I want you
to exfil out of there now.

781
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:08,887
What the hell are you doing?

782
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:41,688
Fuck!

783
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,441
We got surveillance on the roof?

784
00:49:26,476 --> 00:49:28,307
- Yes.
- Cover the fucking roof!

785
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:39,890
Did you go to them,
or did they come to you?

786
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:46,255
Look, Changez...

787
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:48,162
Don't insult me.

788
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:49,325
You want to have a dialogue?

789
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:50,698
Let's have a dialogue.

790
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:54,371
Did you go to them,
or did they come to you?

791
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:57,801
They came to me.

792
00:50:01,547 --> 00:50:03,481
How does that happen?

793
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:05,415
How do you go from
writing so passionately

794
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:07,919
against intervention
in this region to this?

795
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:09,921
You want to know
how it happened?

796
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:11,583
I'll tell you.

797
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,752
In 2001,

798
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:16,591
while you were busy
getting rich in New York City,

799
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,121
I was in Takhar Province,
Afghanistan.

800
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:22,828
A friend introduced me
to Ahmad Shah Massoud.

801
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:25,838
I spent a week interviewing him.

802
00:50:25,872 --> 00:50:28,204
He was opening
schools for girls,

803
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:31,473
talking about democracy,
resisting the Taliban.

804
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:33,480
I know he had blood
on his hands,

805
00:50:33,514 --> 00:50:35,141
but he stood for something,

806
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:36,581
meant something to people,

807
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,676
and that's why I thought
we didn't need to be there.

808
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,347
Massoud never got the chance
to read my book.

809
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:42,720
Six months after it came out,

810
00:50:42,757 --> 00:50:46,421
he was killed by a bomb
hidden in a video camera.

811
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:47,928
Two days after that,

812
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:50,454
the same guys that killed him
took down the towers.

813
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:55,092
And that's when I realized
I'd been wrong.

814
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,802
We did need to be here.

815
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:00,634
So I picked a side.

816
00:51:04,113 --> 00:51:06,581
Look.

817
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:09,210
You obviously knew who I was
coming into this, so...

818
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:10,276
So what?

819
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:14,783
Are we still having
a conversation?

820
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:16,554
Are you still a writer?

821
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:20,357
You may be a spook.

822
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:25,101
But if anyone can
help me, it's you.

823
00:51:28,405 --> 00:51:30,805
You picked a side after 9/11.

824
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:32,968
I didn't have to.

825
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,444
It was picked for me.

826
00:51:36,848 --> 00:51:37,974
All unattended bags

827
00:51:38,016 --> 00:51:39,984
will be removed
by airport police

828
00:51:40,018 --> 00:51:42,782
and immediately seized
and destroyed.

829
00:51:42,821 --> 00:51:45,051
Please do not leave
bags unattended.

830
00:51:48,661 --> 00:51:50,128
Note to self:

831
00:51:50,162 --> 00:51:52,722
don't fuck with the
United States military.

832
00:51:57,503 --> 00:51:59,232
U.S. citizen or foreign national?

833
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:00,397
Foreign national.

834
00:52:00,439 --> 00:52:01,929
Could I see your passport, please?

835
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:13,850
- Step over here, sir.
- Sorry, is there a problem?

836
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:15,354
- He's an employee of mine...
- Follow me, please.

837
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,753
Don't worry about it, man.

838
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,349
I'll catch up with you guys.

839
00:52:21,896 --> 00:52:23,488
Come on.
Let's go.

840
00:52:23,531 --> 00:52:25,021
He's not what they're looking for.

841
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:38,477
Stand right there.

842
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,609
I'll take your belongings.

843
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:46,350
I need you to remove
all of your outerwear

844
00:52:46,388 --> 00:52:47,719
and place it on that chair.

845
00:52:51,427 --> 00:52:53,190
So you want me to strip?

846
00:52:53,229 --> 00:52:54,719
Remove your outerwear.

847
00:53:22,861 --> 00:53:23,885
Who did you stay with?

848
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:25,089
Were you by yourself?

849
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,121
And if not,
who did you travel with?

850
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:30,828
Arms out.
Face this way.

851
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:32,029
Arms out to your side.

852
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:44,873
Arms down.

853
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:46,282
Step over here.

854
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,184
Remove your underwear,
bend over,

855
00:53:48,221 --> 00:53:50,746
place your hands right here,
and spread your legs.

856
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,980
Put your clothes on.

857
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,081
So what happened?
They actually made you strip?

858
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,051
Let's say they were very thorough.

859
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,077
This whole city's
in a state of panic.

860
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,283
60 bomb scares yesterday.

861
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,690
I just found that my college
roommate's father

862
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,388
was in the second tower
when it fell.

863
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,522
It's just a nightmare.

864
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:03,465
Guess people circle the wagons
after something like this.

865
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,992
Apparently they close
the borders too.

866
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:08,403
Could you blame them?

867
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:12,000
Lunatics hijacked planes
from two different states,

868
00:55:12,043 --> 00:55:15,069
killing thousands of people,
not to mention themselves.

869
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,445
It's beyond human comprehension.

870
00:55:19,151 --> 00:55:21,779
How does that happen?

871
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,186
How does it happen like that?

872
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,780
What makes you think
I'd know?

873
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:34,332
Nothing.
You...

874
00:55:41,774 --> 00:55:43,435
Sorry, Changez.

875
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:47,407
All I'm saying is,

876
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:49,575
before I'd start
a full F-16, tank-ass war

877
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:52,084
against the entire Muslim world,

878
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:54,087
I'd give the CIA,
INTERPOL, whoever,

879
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:56,282
a chance to track these
motherfuckers down.

880
00:55:56,323 --> 00:55:57,688
We got hit first.

881
00:55:57,725 --> 00:55:59,056
It's Pearl Harbor
all over again.

882
00:55:59,093 --> 00:56:00,219
It's common fucking sense.

883
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,421
I'm not saying you're wrong,

884
00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:02,862
but what nation-state
attacked us?

885
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:03,955
Nation-state, my ass!

886
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:05,057
You're splitting hairs.

887
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,294
- Am I?
- Yeah.

888
00:56:06,334 --> 00:56:08,359
They believe God told them
to blow us up.

889
00:56:08,403 --> 00:56:09,836
It's in their book.

890
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:10,929
It's in their book?

891
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:12,564
Yeah.
Whatever it's called.

892
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:15,369
I watched as American patriotism

893
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,877
took on different forms.

894
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:18,812
American flags.
God bless America.

895
00:56:18,848 --> 00:56:20,076
Aha!
You want?

896
00:56:20,116 --> 00:56:23,847
For some people,
it provided comfort;

897
00:56:23,886 --> 00:56:25,080
for others, a profit.

898
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:26,952
Hey, give me flag too.

899
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:28,320
Go!
$10, $10.

900
00:56:28,357 --> 00:56:30,348
And for the vulnerable,
it became a shield.

901
00:56:30,393 --> 00:56:32,918
American-led military attacks
continue tonight

902
00:56:32,962 --> 00:56:35,329
against targets throughout Afghanistan.

903
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:37,390
Even as the first emergency...

904
00:56:37,434 --> 00:56:39,698
I'm famished.

905
00:56:39,736 --> 00:56:41,067
We ordered two lassis.

906
00:56:43,306 --> 00:56:44,466
It's bad times, man.

907
00:56:44,508 --> 00:56:46,999
Seven more attacks
in the last week.

908
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:48,341
Is this the line for chai?

909
00:56:48,378 --> 00:56:50,073
You hear about Sodhi
in Arizona?

910
00:56:50,113 --> 00:56:52,048
They shot him
right on the street.

911
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,311
It's really bad for the Sikhs.

912
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:55,444
Sikhs are in trouble.

913
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:57,477
Any beard or turban is a target.

914
00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:00,489
Not a problem for you, eh?

915
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:04,222
Suited, booted.
Good for you.

916
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,286
No plastic here.

917
00:57:09,368 --> 00:57:11,359
- Give him his tea.
- No, no, please.

918
00:57:11,403 --> 00:57:12,927
Don't embarrass me.

919
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,405
You are like my brother.

920
00:57:15,441 --> 00:57:16,499
Thanks.

921
00:57:18,577 --> 00:57:20,442
I might have been suited
and booted,

922
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:23,142
but I felt just as vulnerable
as they did.

923
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:26,476
There was only one place
I felt safe...

924
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:29,118
With her.

925
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:30,713
You want to learn
how to say "love"?

926
00:57:30,757 --> 00:57:32,224
Yeah.

927
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:34,055
There's not just one way
of saying it.

928
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:36,324
- There's, like, two or three.
- Okay, okay.

929
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:41,228
Okay, so there's ishq.

930
00:57:41,268 --> 00:57:42,284
Ishq.

931
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:43,833
Ishq.

932
00:57:45,773 --> 00:57:46,740
Ishq.

933
00:57:46,774 --> 00:57:48,401
Mm.
Well done.

934
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:51,411
And then there's pyaar.

935
00:57:51,445 --> 00:57:53,778
Pyaar.

936
00:57:53,815 --> 00:57:54,873
That's quite good.

937
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:55,905
Yeah?

938
00:57:55,951 --> 00:57:58,078
- You're good at this.
- Pyaar.

939
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,985
You said this word before
to someone?

940
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:01,386
Ishq.
Pyaar.

941
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:03,721
This isn't your first time, is it?

942
00:58:35,926 --> 00:58:37,567
Mohabbat.

943
00:58:38,479 --> 00:58:39,721
Mohabbat.

944
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:45,366
I can't believe
they're not there.

945
00:59:17,337 --> 00:59:18,497
It's crazy.

946
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:22,171
It was a time of uncertainty.

947
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:25,372
For me, the only things certain
were love and profit.

948
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,076
It wasn't long before the
economic laws of nature

949
00:59:29,116 --> 00:59:31,084
reasserted themselves.

950
00:59:31,118 --> 00:59:34,417
Small companies were again
swallowed up by big ones.

951
00:59:34,455 --> 00:59:36,719
Those that didn't grow would die.

952
00:59:38,259 --> 00:59:40,420
Some stakeholders are obviously
you people right here.

953
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:41,655
That's why need to revisit...

954
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:43,391
For the 25 years that
I've worked here,

955
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:45,059
per union rules,

956
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,795
we only take those requests
in writing.

957
00:59:46,835 --> 00:59:47,961
See, with due respect,

958
00:59:48,003 --> 00:59:50,267
that is exactly the kind
of bureaucratic mind-set

959
00:59:50,305 --> 00:59:51,533
we're trying to challenge here.

960
00:59:51,573 --> 00:59:53,200
I am not a bureaucrat.

961
00:59:53,242 --> 00:59:54,607
We don't have to like each other.

962
00:59:54,643 --> 00:59:56,372
We just have to get the job done.

963
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:57,810
Now, pull out the union contracts.

964
00:59:57,846 --> 00:59:59,336
We might need to cancel
some of them.

965
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:03,045
- He's young.
- I've worked here 25 years.

966
01:00:03,086 --> 01:00:04,917
What the hell am I supposed to do?

967
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:30,040
Hi, stranger.

968
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,513
When are you coming back?

969
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:32,709
I miss you.

970
01:01:12,993 --> 01:01:16,087
Fuck you, Osama.

971
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:28,408
A tiny slice of violence

972
01:01:28,443 --> 01:01:30,434
had wormed its way into my life,

973
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,571
and I didn't know
how to remove it.

974
01:01:39,888 --> 01:01:43,016
What was soft inside me
fell away.

975
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:45,720
What was hard became harder.

976
01:01:54,137 --> 01:01:56,071
Talk to me, Bobby.
What's going on?

977
01:01:56,106 --> 01:01:57,539
I need more time.

978
01:01:57,574 --> 01:02:01,101
You're exposed, and the clock
is ticking on Rainier.

979
01:02:01,144 --> 01:02:02,304
Turn your target now,

980
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:03,539
or we're taking him to Peshawar

981
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,047
to put the screws on him.

982
01:02:05,081 --> 01:02:06,139
Okay.

983
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:13,119
What did Massoud do
to members of his force

984
01:02:13,157 --> 01:02:15,022
that collaborated
with the Taliban?

985
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,720
He slit their throats.

986
01:02:17,762 --> 01:02:18,922
Yes, he did.

987
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:22,864
Do you want that
to happen to me, Bobby?

988
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,096
Is there something
you're not telling me?

989
01:02:25,137 --> 01:02:26,798
Juniad, look at that.

990
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,364
Careful.

991
01:02:29,408 --> 01:02:30,466
Watch out.

992
01:02:31,476 --> 01:02:33,376
Brother...

993
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:35,778
Khan, sir, let's go down.

994
01:02:38,683 --> 01:02:39,844
Hurry.

995
01:02:41,754 --> 01:02:43,722
Each moment is precious,
Bobby.

996
01:02:43,756 --> 01:02:45,815
Come.
It's time to go inside.

997
01:02:45,858 --> 01:02:48,554
Where is the security guard?

998
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:02,609
Hello?

999
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:04,372
I'm talking to you, Ma.
Hello?

1000
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:07,504
Keep the candles safely.

1001
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:10,676
Trouble could break out anytime.

1002
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:14,415
The sweets go in the kitchen,
the soft drinks too.

1003
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:16,754
Ma, you're being stubborn.

1004
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:18,816
I'll make one phone call
to the caterers.

1005
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,691
They will handle everything, okay?

1006
01:03:20,728 --> 01:03:23,322
Baita, with the shortages,
the prices have doubled up.

1007
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:24,695
We just can't afford it.

1008
01:03:24,732 --> 01:03:26,700
No, what we can't afford
is for you to collapse,

1009
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,293
okay, because you're trying
to organize

1010
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,032
your daughter's wedding
singlehandedly.

1011
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:32,370
Just let me do it.
It's done.

1012
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,641
My prince.

1013
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,307
Out of my sight.

1014
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,906
One thing.

1015
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,008
Don't tell Abu.

1016
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,781
Okay, I won't.

1017
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,981
Okay, talk later.

1018
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:46,989
Love you, baita.

1019
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:48,012
Uh-huh.
Okay.

1020
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,047
God be with you.

1021
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:51,683
Hello!
Enough already!

1022
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,059
- Just... just look at me.
- Hello?

1023
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:54,961
Just look at... okay, fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

1024
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,329
You're unbelievable.
Do you know that?

1025
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:57,526
I'm worried about my mom here.

1026
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,695
She's going nuts
because of the wedding.

1027
01:03:59,737 --> 01:04:01,932
A wedding gets her closer
to grandchildren.

1028
01:04:01,973 --> 01:04:04,407
That's what she wants, right?

1029
01:04:04,442 --> 01:04:05,602
Yeah, I guess.

1030
01:04:08,479 --> 01:04:10,947
I made your mom and dad
something for the wedding.

1031
01:04:16,255 --> 01:04:17,654
That's why you wanted the photos?

1032
01:04:17,689 --> 01:04:19,884
Your ma is so gorgeous.

1033
01:04:19,925 --> 01:04:22,325
Mm.

1034
01:04:22,361 --> 01:04:23,692
You're gorgeous.
Thank you.

1035
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:24,753
Mm.

1036
01:04:32,672 --> 01:04:34,162
Do you ever think about kids?

1037
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,934
Um...

1038
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,106
I did before,

1039
01:04:42,148 --> 01:04:43,740
but the world's a little scarier now,

1040
01:04:43,783 --> 01:04:45,683
so I'm not as sure
as I used to be.

1041
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:51,557
My parents never said it
out loud,

1042
01:04:51,592 --> 01:04:53,116
but I know they want
two things in life.

1043
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,152
They want security
in their old age,

1044
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:58,494
and they want grandchildren.

1045
01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:01,228
And you want to
give that to them.

1046
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:02,930
Yeah.
They're my parents.

1047
01:05:03,972 --> 01:05:05,667
You have a sense of filial duty.

1048
01:05:08,043 --> 01:05:09,874
Yeah, I guess
I'm old-fashioned like that.

1049
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,972
It's nice.

1050
01:05:15,116 --> 01:05:17,016
So does that mean
you're persuadable?

1051
01:05:22,224 --> 01:05:23,316
I don't know.

1052
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:02,390
Hey.

1053
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:06,035
Erica?

1054
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,163
Hey, what is it?

1055
01:06:07,206 --> 01:06:08,298
What's wrong?

1056
01:06:12,544 --> 01:06:13,636
Erica...

1057
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:15,973
Ah.

1058
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:20,508
I can't believe I'm talking
about having kids

1059
01:06:20,552 --> 01:06:21,815
with another man.

1060
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:26,922
Honey, it was just talking.

1061
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,154
It was just fooling around.

1062
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,752
And I'm not another man.

1063
01:06:29,796 --> 01:06:31,093
No, no, no.
No, no.

1064
01:06:31,131 --> 01:06:33,292
You are another man.

1065
01:06:36,503 --> 01:06:37,663
You are.

1066
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:53,087
Chris... he didn't have any family.

1067
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:56,579
Not like you.
I was his family, okay?

1068
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:59,788
I was his family,
and I'm forgetting him.

1069
01:07:03,365 --> 01:07:04,923
Oh, God.

1070
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:07,833
You know, I had been...
I'd been drinking,

1071
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:10,839
and Chris asked me
if I was okay to drive,

1072
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:12,500
and I said yes.

1073
01:07:15,912 --> 01:07:17,072
I killed him.

1074
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:23,441
Oh, God.

1075
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:25,455
Sometimes I just wish

1076
01:07:25,489 --> 01:07:27,980
I could take a break
from being myself.

1077
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,030
Me too.

1078
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:45,535
Following the Parliament
attack in New Delhi,

1079
01:07:45,577 --> 01:07:48,603
the troops are gathering
at the border.

1080
01:07:48,646 --> 01:07:53,743
The fear of war between
India and Pakistan...

1081
01:07:53,785 --> 01:07:56,414
Nuclear powers,
grows every day.

1082
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,415
How many weddings have
a bomb shelter contingency plan?

1083
01:08:00,459 --> 01:08:02,427
The world couldn't wait
one more week

1084
01:08:02,461 --> 01:08:03,689
before exploding itself?

1085
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:05,560
Hello. Let's stick to
happier subjects.

1086
01:08:05,598 --> 01:08:07,327
How's the groom?

1087
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:08,765
He's an actor, so...

1088
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:11,497
A working actor
but an actor nonetheless.

1089
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:14,473
Poor Abu keeps his
heart medication close at hand.

1090
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,135
You know, if the war
doesn't kill him...

1091
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,336
The wedding costs will.

1092
01:08:19,813 --> 01:08:20,973
Move on.

1093
01:08:23,784 --> 01:08:25,877
They never stop girls.

1094
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:31,457
Pakistan was born into
violence 50 years ago.

1095
01:08:31,492 --> 01:08:34,461
We knew how to cope.

1096
01:08:34,495 --> 01:08:35,723
As the tensions became worse,

1097
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:38,129
the biryanis became
more delicious,

1098
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:39,963
the bootleggers
more frequent,

1099
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:42,765
and the celebrations
more raucous.

1100
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:06,959
Here comes the groom!

1101
01:09:13,703 --> 01:09:15,136
Really?

1102
01:09:15,171 --> 01:09:18,335
Girls, be on time to dress her
for the wedding tomorrow, huh?

1103
01:09:21,345 --> 01:09:23,279
Did you make this?

1104
01:09:23,314 --> 01:09:24,440
Show me your ring.

1105
01:09:31,623 --> 01:09:34,251
What are you thinking about?

1106
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:36,692
Just how much you must love
all this attention, no?

1107
01:09:37,796 --> 01:09:38,854
Not about your girlfriend?

1108
01:09:55,648 --> 01:09:58,139
Your turn next, Nasreen, hmm?

1109
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:01,209
Find me a guy now.

1110
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:06,059
Lovely girl, and from a good family.

1111
01:10:07,327 --> 01:10:10,319
But you can't consider her

1112
01:10:10,364 --> 01:10:12,662
because you're an ocean away.

1113
01:10:12,699 --> 01:10:14,929
Luckily, Abu, they have women
in New York too, you know.

1114
01:10:14,968 --> 01:10:16,936
I'm sure they do.

1115
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,970
What exactly do you do
at the Underwood?

1116
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,343
It's Underwood Samson.

1117
01:10:27,482 --> 01:10:29,746
We help companies to figure out
how much they're worth,

1118
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:31,012
and then we make suggestions

1119
01:10:31,052 --> 01:10:32,917
so that they can increase their value.

1120
01:10:32,954 --> 01:10:34,684
Hmm.

1121
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:35,883
So...

1122
01:10:37,927 --> 01:10:39,952
I'm a fruit seller.

1123
01:10:39,995 --> 01:10:41,792
You don't buy my guavas.

1124
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,889
- You don't sell me guavas.
- No.

1125
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:45,992
I pay you to tell me,

1126
01:10:46,035 --> 01:10:49,937
"The price of the guava
is 8 rupees. "

1127
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:52,406
Yes, but I can also help you
to increase the value

1128
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:53,841
of your whole fruit stand.

1129
01:10:53,877 --> 01:10:55,538
With redundancies.

1130
01:10:57,013 --> 01:10:59,982
So two fruit sellers become one,

1131
01:11:00,016 --> 01:11:01,813
and the money is saved.

1132
01:11:01,851 --> 01:11:03,284
Terrific.

1133
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,344
I don't see the point.

1134
01:11:05,855 --> 01:11:07,289
I'll send you back
to your village!

1135
01:11:07,325 --> 01:11:08,314
Sorry, sir.

1136
01:11:12,697 --> 01:11:15,097
In the tent, the supervisor
will fire him.

1137
01:11:15,132 --> 01:11:17,760
That young man
drops one plate,

1138
01:11:17,802 --> 01:11:20,396
and his livelihood is gone.

1139
01:11:20,438 --> 01:11:21,769
I should talk to the supervisor.

1140
01:11:21,806 --> 01:11:24,036
No, no, no, no, no.

1141
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,441
Come here.

1142
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:28,037
Your empathy is aroused

1143
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,379
because of this one man
whose face you can see.

1144
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,384
But with one line
of your pen,

1145
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:35,181
thousands of people
lose their livelihoods.

1146
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,209
Abu, you know what?

1147
01:11:36,254 --> 01:11:37,243
A lot of people...

1148
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:38,655
middle-class people,
shareholders...

1149
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:40,181
they all benefit
from what I do.

1150
01:11:41,961 --> 01:11:43,895
You tell yourself
what you want to.

1151
01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:55,201
You see your mother's handiwork?

1152
01:11:57,311 --> 01:12:00,678
If I told you the amount
your Ammi had to work with,

1153
01:12:00,714 --> 01:12:01,840
you wouldn't believe me.

1154
01:12:03,384 --> 01:12:04,476
What is it?

1155
01:12:04,518 --> 01:12:05,712
- Nothing.
- What, nothing?

1156
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:07,345
Nothing?

1157
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:09,720
Never choke on a true word, son.

1158
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,651
Well, she had some assistance.

1159
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:14,753
What do you mean?

1160
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:15,922
I mean that this job of mine

1161
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:17,295
that you don't see the point of

1162
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:19,823
actually helped to create
this celebration, all right?

1163
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:22,393
- Excuse me.
- No, no, Abu.

1164
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:23,563
I'm just trying to tell you

1165
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:27,006
that this work of mine
can be useful to us.

1166
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:31,142
You've made your point very well.

1167
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,741
Thank you.

1168
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:38,743
# You say things
to burn the heart... #

1169
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,719
# You speak of a nest
now broken... #

1170
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:57,029
# You inflict such suffering... #

1171
01:13:01,813 --> 01:13:05,772
# Yet say I must smile... #

1172
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:24,468
My wisest ally, and I'd cut
him to the quick.

1173
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:26,733
Only his pride.

1174
01:13:26,772 --> 01:13:29,070
Please, Changez,
don't let yours get in the way

1175
01:13:29,108 --> 01:13:30,302
of doing the right thing.

1176
01:13:30,342 --> 01:13:31,434
What would you have me do?

1177
01:13:31,477 --> 01:13:33,378
Help us find Rainier.

1178
01:13:34,514 --> 01:13:36,641
Changez...

1179
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:37,843
Work with us.

1180
01:13:40,286 --> 01:13:41,719
The agency has discretionary funds

1181
01:13:41,754 --> 01:13:42,914
for this kind of thing.

1182
01:13:42,956 --> 01:13:44,891
We can protect your family,
relocate them.

1183
01:13:47,528 --> 01:13:49,519
Bobby, you promised
to listen to me, didn't you?

1184
01:13:51,232 --> 01:13:53,564
Did you not hear
a word I just said?

1185
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:56,365
There are some things
that money cannot fix.

1186
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,902
When I returned
to America,

1187
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,669
I found that the life
I was building

1188
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:03,438
had begun to slip out of reach.

1189
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:12,119
Should get this guy a razor.

1190
01:14:12,154 --> 01:14:13,587
Yeah, hi, Erica, it's me.

1191
01:14:13,622 --> 01:14:14,919
Can you pick up, please?

1192
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:17,187
I haven't heard from you
in a few days now.

1193
01:14:17,226 --> 01:14:20,525
And I don't know what kind of
magical artistic masterpieces

1194
01:14:20,563 --> 01:14:23,361
you're cooking up,
but I miss you.

1195
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:24,991
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.

1196
01:14:25,034 --> 01:14:28,265
Ah, that is the sound
I wanted to hear!

1197
01:14:28,304 --> 01:14:29,601
Okay, listen.
Hear me out.

1198
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:30,799
I know you're on a deadline.

1199
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,501
My show's in three days.

1200
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:35,534
Look, I'm so under
the gun right now.

1201
01:14:35,578 --> 01:14:37,638
I just... I can't talk.

1202
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:38,943
- Okay, but dinner.
Just dinner.

1203
01:14:38,982 --> 01:14:40,381
I haven't even told you
about the wedding.

1204
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:41,850
They loved your present.

1205
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:43,910
Please don't make me feel guilty.

1206
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:45,683
Okay, your work
is important to you.

1207
01:14:45,722 --> 01:14:47,189
Okay, but I don't get to choose

1208
01:14:47,224 --> 01:14:48,692
when to take time off; you do.

1209
01:14:48,726 --> 01:14:51,217
So, like, one hour
is all I'm asking for.

1210
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:53,230
I had a Pakistani once,

1211
01:14:53,264 --> 01:14:54,754
and he was very supportive.

1212
01:15:05,443 --> 01:15:06,501
Hey.

1213
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,638
Hey yourself, werewolf.

1214
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:12,310
Not sure what's going on
with the beard situation,

1215
01:15:12,351 --> 01:15:15,809
but it's starting to freak
some people out around here.

1216
01:15:15,854 --> 01:15:16,912
I don't understand.

1217
01:15:16,956 --> 01:15:18,617
But Dr. Phil has a mustache.

1218
01:15:20,694 --> 01:15:22,252
What? It reminds me
of where I come from.

1219
01:15:22,295 --> 01:15:24,229
Jerk chicken reminds me
of where I come from,

1220
01:15:24,264 --> 01:15:27,233
but I'm not smearing it
all over my face.

1221
01:15:27,267 --> 01:15:28,529
Maybe you should.

1222
01:15:50,992 --> 01:15:52,688
You have a message.

1223
01:15:52,728 --> 01:15:53,854
Happy Eid, son.

1224
01:15:53,895 --> 01:15:55,021
Happy Eid.

1225
01:15:55,063 --> 01:15:57,327
The house is no fun without you.

1226
01:15:57,366 --> 01:15:59,334
There's no power either.

1227
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:01,563
We'll eat in the dark tonight.

1228
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:03,468
Thinking of you, baita.

1229
01:16:03,505 --> 01:16:05,166
Abu also.

1230
01:16:05,207 --> 01:16:07,141
Much love.

1231
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:21,079
Happy Eid.

1232
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:30,597
Quite a beard.

1233
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:33,660
That's getting to be some
very serious mullah action.

1234
01:16:34,972 --> 01:16:36,940
I want you to get me
two glasses of the crystal...

1235
01:16:43,615 --> 01:16:45,947
So we've got to evaluate
a prestige publisher

1236
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:47,576
in Istanbul for a conglomerate.

1237
01:16:47,619 --> 01:16:48,711
And guess what.

1238
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:50,380
You are the chosen one.

1239
01:16:50,422 --> 01:16:52,322
Thank you.

1240
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,222
The directors agreed with me.

1241
01:16:54,259 --> 01:16:56,387
We're upping you.

1242
01:16:56,429 --> 01:16:57,623
You are the youngest associate

1243
01:16:57,663 --> 01:16:59,597
in the history of Underwood Samson.

1244
01:17:04,103 --> 01:17:07,903
Although, I do believe
appearances are important.

1245
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:10,738
Success requires...

1246
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:13,244
some adjustment
in that department.

1247
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:19,075
Underwood, Samson,

1248
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:21,212
and The Mighty Khan.

1249
01:17:21,254 --> 01:17:22,721
Oh, no partners.

1250
01:17:22,756 --> 01:17:24,485
Just Khan. I'm a dictator,
remember?

1251
01:17:24,524 --> 01:17:25,548
Mm.

1252
01:17:27,528 --> 01:17:28,995
Motherfucker.

1253
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,555
Next time you want to see me,
call my secretary, okay?

1254
01:17:31,599 --> 01:17:32,759
Up yours.

1255
01:17:58,327 --> 01:17:59,795
I'm not going to take
medication!

1256
01:17:59,829 --> 01:18:00,796
911.

1257
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,127
No more medication.

1258
01:18:02,165 --> 01:18:04,030
There's a crazy Arab guy
in midtown Manhattan.

1259
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:05,364
Long-distance killer!

1260
01:18:05,402 --> 01:18:07,063
Why he get all credit?

1261
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,401
Yeah, 53rd and Lexington.

1262
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:11,407
Homegrown!

1263
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:12,874
We are homegrown bombers!

1264
01:18:12,909 --> 01:18:14,706
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We're homegrown bombers!

1265
01:18:14,744 --> 01:18:16,644
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We are homegrown bomb...

1266
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:18,010
Bomb your children!

1267
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:19,310
You bastard!
Hey!

1268
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,317
He's crazy.

1269
01:18:28,192 --> 01:18:29,989
Hey!
Hold up!

1270
01:18:30,027 --> 01:18:31,996
You in the black coat,
stop right there.

1271
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:33,327
- I didn't do...
- Hands on the car.

1272
01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:35,162
- I didn't do anything.
- Put your hands on the car.

1273
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,724
The guy you're looking for
is back there.

1274
01:18:36,768 --> 01:18:37,928
Yeah, we'll get him.

1275
01:18:37,969 --> 01:18:39,527
- I work on the 53rd floor...
- Hands down.

1276
01:18:39,571 --> 01:18:41,095
Of that building,
Underwood Samson.

1277
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:42,902
Why don't you just check?

1278
01:18:42,941 --> 01:18:44,465
Why don't you just...

1279
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:45,999
- Officer, please.
- Spread your legs!

1280
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:48,274
You got any weapons on you?

1281
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:49,575
Don't do this, man.

1282
01:18:49,614 --> 01:18:52,140
Ain't doing nothing
but my job, little man.

1283
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:58,652
Ow, man!

1284
01:18:58,691 --> 01:19:01,216
Uh-uh!
Get your hands off me!

1285
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,387
Uh!

1286
01:19:05,732 --> 01:19:06,824
Wait right here.

1287
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:34,921
I'm Special Agent Ford.

1288
01:19:34,964 --> 01:19:36,329
This is Special Agent Jackson.

1289
01:19:36,365 --> 01:19:37,457
This is inexcusable.

1290
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,161
I'd like to see my lawyer, please.

1291
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,699
Are you refusing to talk
to us?

1292
01:19:46,742 --> 01:19:48,209
No, you picked up
the wrong guy,

1293
01:19:48,244 --> 01:19:49,302
and I'm sick of this shit.

1294
01:19:49,345 --> 01:19:52,337
I want to see my lawyer.

1295
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:54,475
You ever been to the Philippines?

1296
01:19:59,122 --> 01:20:01,682
I work at Underwood Samson.

1297
01:20:01,725 --> 01:20:05,058
I was inspecting a company there
as a financial analyst.

1298
01:20:06,497 --> 01:20:09,989
You ever had any combat
training in Afghanistan?

1299
01:20:14,272 --> 01:20:16,001
Of course I've never had
combat training,

1300
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,304
and I've never set foot
in Afghanistan!

1301
01:20:18,342 --> 01:20:19,570
Don't get upset.

1302
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:21,237
I am upset. I'm upset
about my treatment.

1303
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:22,610
I'm not a fucking terrorist.

1304
01:20:26,318 --> 01:20:29,253
Have you ever been a member
of a terrorist organization?

1305
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:30,550
Okay, you know what?

1306
01:20:30,589 --> 01:20:32,887
I'm sick of having to try
and prove a negative,

1307
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:34,825
so why don't you either
charge me with something

1308
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,350
or let me go?

1309
01:20:42,468 --> 01:20:44,629
How do you feel about the
United States of America?

1310
01:20:51,611 --> 01:20:53,238
Agent Ford,

1311
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:55,941
I love the United States of America.

1312
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:01,914
Hey, baby, I can't wait to see you

1313
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:03,548
at my opening tonight.

1314
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:07,118
And the gallery's on the corner
of Crosby and Prince.

1315
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:08,492
Okay, I'll see you.

1316
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,333
Hey, Marina!

1317
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,165
Hi, sugar.

1318
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,578
I'm alone.

1319
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:30,143
I'm very, very alone.

1320
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:34,551
I want to forget.

1321
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,853
Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder:

1322
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,829
never accept a parcel or bag

1323
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,230
from a third party
for any reason.

1324
01:21:51,141 --> 01:21:52,802
I want to forget.

1325
01:21:54,044 --> 01:21:56,376
Never leave your baggage
unattended.

1326
01:21:57,948 --> 01:21:59,939
- Hors d'oeuvres?
- Oh, no, I'm vegan.

1327
01:22:05,523 --> 01:22:07,821
I had a Pakistani once...

1328
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:18,469
I'm glad... I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

1329
01:22:18,504 --> 01:22:20,233
Good to see you.

1330
01:22:20,272 --> 01:22:21,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

1331
01:22:21,507 --> 01:22:22,769
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

1332
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:24,207
Ah.

1333
01:22:24,243 --> 01:22:26,803
- This is amazing.
- Thank you.

1334
01:22:26,845 --> 01:22:28,312
Changez?

1335
01:22:28,347 --> 01:22:29,507
Changez!

1336
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:37,419
I'm so happy you're here.

1337
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:40,187
I don't recognize my
own voice anymore.

1338
01:22:40,226 --> 01:22:41,523
What have you done?

1339
01:22:41,561 --> 01:22:43,928
It's... what do you mean?

1340
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:45,124
This is us.

1341
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,362
It's about us.

1342
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:49,733
From you too now?

1343
01:22:52,506 --> 01:22:54,974
You're the one goddamn person
I trusted in this city,

1344
01:22:55,009 --> 01:22:57,307
and now I get this shit,

1345
01:22:57,344 --> 01:22:59,972
this fucking shit
from you too now?

1346
01:23:03,684 --> 01:23:04,810
Hmm?
- I don't...

1347
01:23:04,852 --> 01:23:06,753
I thought... I thought...

1348
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:08,380
I thought you'd be proud of me.

1349
01:23:08,423 --> 01:23:09,651
- Why would I be proud?
What?

1350
01:23:09,691 --> 01:23:12,683
Proud of being your own
little pet artistic project?

1351
01:23:12,728 --> 01:23:14,059
Can we please take this outside?

1352
01:23:14,096 --> 01:23:15,860
- No, what?
Was that the idea?

1353
01:23:15,898 --> 01:23:17,525
Huh?
How chic! How chic!

1354
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:20,502
"I'm gonna date a Pakistani
after 9/11,

1355
01:23:20,536 --> 01:23:22,766
and it's gonna be great
for my bohemian street cred. "

1356
01:23:22,805 --> 01:23:24,602
Is that the idea?
- That's completely unfair.

1357
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,371
"I fucked the 20th hijacker"?
Huh?

1358
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:31,403
I'm like the ultimate downtown
status symbol right now.

1359
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:34,583
Is that it? You're just
gonna walk away?

1360
01:23:34,617 --> 01:23:36,141
That's all you got to say
for yourself?

1361
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:39,314
I mean, are your feelings so pure?

1362
01:23:39,356 --> 01:23:40,789
Would you have
been interested in me

1363
01:23:40,824 --> 01:23:42,257
if my uncle wasn't your CEO

1364
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:46,160
or if my mother lived in Queens
instead of Park and 85th?

1365
01:23:46,196 --> 01:23:47,994
- Are you kidding me?
You're a sick girl.

1366
01:23:48,032 --> 01:23:49,397
It was never about that for me!

1367
01:23:49,434 --> 01:23:50,594
You might not believe this,

1368
01:23:50,635 --> 01:23:52,432
but that is an expression of love.

1369
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:54,563
- You know what it is?
That... that is defamation.

1370
01:23:54,606 --> 01:23:55,664
I want it taken down.

1371
01:23:55,707 --> 01:23:57,174
Changez, please.

1372
01:23:58,843 --> 01:24:01,403
Please, just take a breath.

1373
01:24:01,446 --> 01:24:03,073
I can't believe
you're reacting this way.

1374
01:24:03,114 --> 01:24:04,240
How do you want me to react?

1375
01:24:04,282 --> 01:24:05,271
Please take a breath.

1376
01:24:05,316 --> 01:24:06,544
How could you do that?

1377
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:07,710
Stop attacking me!

1378
01:24:07,752 --> 01:24:09,311
Stop attacking me
for one minute!

1379
01:24:09,355 --> 01:24:11,448
Please stop attacking me!
Please!

1380
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:13,788
Please stop attacking me!

1381
01:24:13,826 --> 01:24:16,727
You could do it because
you're reckless.

1382
01:24:16,762 --> 01:24:19,425
You're reckless enough
to drive drunk

1383
01:24:19,466 --> 01:24:21,491
with the person
you supposedly love

1384
01:24:21,535 --> 01:24:23,503
sitting in the passenger seat.

1385
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:24,697
Oh...

1386
01:24:34,381 --> 01:24:36,076
Oh, I didn't know...

1387
01:24:36,116 --> 01:24:39,210
I didn't know you could
be capable of such cruelty.

1388
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:02,636
Well...

1389
01:25:45,757 --> 01:25:47,156
The holding company acquired

1390
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:48,853
Basak Yayimci Publishing
nine years ago.

1391
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,156
It used to be a classy press,

1392
01:25:50,195 --> 01:25:51,321
but it's hemorrhaging money,

1393
01:25:51,363 --> 01:25:52,762
and we need to stop the bleeding.

1394
01:25:59,805 --> 01:26:02,330
Nazmi Kemal will not
be happy to see us.

1395
01:26:08,381 --> 01:26:10,713
For 42 years,

1396
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,240
I've made books.

1397
01:26:13,953 --> 01:26:16,946
And through this press,

1398
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:18,958
the greatest Middle Eastern writers

1399
01:26:18,992 --> 01:26:21,290
have given their stories to the world.

1400
01:26:23,597 --> 01:26:26,032
And you've come here
to render me obsolete.

1401
01:26:27,335 --> 01:26:31,169
I have great respect for
the work of publishers.

1402
01:26:31,205 --> 01:26:34,470
I've valued half a dozen or so
over the last ten years.

1403
01:26:38,446 --> 01:26:40,710
Are you qualified to value me?

1404
01:26:48,757 --> 01:26:50,554
Well, no one can put a value

1405
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:52,150
on what you've accomplished here.

1406
01:26:54,463 --> 01:26:55,987
My father is a poet.

1407
01:26:56,031 --> 01:26:57,259
He's well known in the Punjab.

1408
01:26:57,299 --> 01:26:59,131
His greatest friend is his publisher.

1409
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:04,304
You are a keeper of our culture
in this part of the world.

1410
01:27:05,408 --> 01:27:06,841
Your father is a poet?

1411
01:27:12,816 --> 01:27:16,115
I think you should be ashamed
of yourself,

1412
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:19,485
doing what you're doing here.

1413
01:27:21,559 --> 01:27:23,459
Right.

1414
01:27:23,494 --> 01:27:25,689
If you'll excuse us,
we need to use your office.

1415
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:29,728
The accounts you asked for.

1416
01:27:29,768 --> 01:27:30,709
Thank you.

1417
01:27:31,362 --> 01:27:32,298
Thank you.

1418
01:27:36,408 --> 01:27:37,875
Last two years.

1419
01:27:37,909 --> 01:27:38,967
Right.

1420
01:27:47,419 --> 01:27:48,477
Take these figures,

1421
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,488
discount it to the net
present value.

1422
01:27:50,522 --> 01:27:51,682
What's the ROA?

1423
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,220
Zero.

1424
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:00,160
I'll call London.

1425
01:29:32,264 --> 01:29:33,424
Changez.

1426
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:36,328
Look what I found.

1427
01:29:39,739 --> 01:29:41,502
Part of an anthology

1428
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:43,839
of contemporary poets
from the Punjab.

1429
01:29:44,978 --> 01:29:46,969
Your father is Ajmal Khan, correct?

1430
01:29:54,087 --> 01:29:57,147
I didn't realize he'd been
translated into Turkish.

1431
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:58,350
That's for you.

1432
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:00,786
Thank you very much.

1433
01:30:05,766 --> 01:30:07,700
Would you care to join
me for lunch?

1434
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:10,529
Sure.

1435
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,441
Have you heard
of the Janissaries?

1436
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:28,282
No.

1437
01:30:32,228 --> 01:30:33,855
They were Christian boys

1438
01:30:33,896 --> 01:30:36,558
captured by the Ottomans

1439
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:39,193
to be soldiers in the
mighty Muslim army.

1440
01:30:42,206 --> 01:30:45,767
When they came of age,

1441
01:30:45,809 --> 01:30:48,277
they were sent to kill
their former families

1442
01:30:48,312 --> 01:30:50,303
and destroy
their former homes.

1443
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,311
How old were you when
you went to America?

1444
01:31:00,123 --> 01:31:02,250
I was 18.

1445
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:04,386
Ah.
Much older.

1446
01:31:09,067 --> 01:31:11,662
The Janissaries were always
taken in childhood.

1447
01:31:12,805 --> 01:31:15,774
And when they became men,

1448
01:31:15,808 --> 01:31:18,902
they were devoted
to their new caretakers

1449
01:31:18,944 --> 01:31:20,673
to serve their adopted empire.

1450
01:31:20,713 --> 01:31:22,943
I'm not devoted to the empire.

1451
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:24,074
Mm.

1452
01:31:32,725 --> 01:31:34,158
I apologize for my demeanor.

1453
01:31:34,193 --> 01:31:36,719
I'm working through some
personal matters at the moment.

1454
01:31:36,763 --> 01:31:37,923
A woman.

1455
01:31:41,768 --> 01:31:45,068
Young men don't make
good mercenaries.

1456
01:31:45,106 --> 01:31:46,767
They need a cause to fight.

1457
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:51,437
May I?

1458
01:31:55,683 --> 01:31:56,775
Mm.

1459
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:05,288
When you determine
where you stand,

1460
01:32:05,326 --> 01:32:07,352
the color will return
to your world.

1461
01:32:09,197 --> 01:32:11,995
I'm not so hopeful about
the color returning to mine.

1462
01:32:47,972 --> 01:32:49,439
Hey.

1463
01:32:49,474 --> 01:32:50,805
Good news.

1464
01:32:50,842 --> 01:32:53,276
London gave us the green light
to terminate Nazmi Kemal

1465
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:55,279
and shutter the offices here.

1466
01:32:55,313 --> 01:32:58,578
They want us to take care of it
because we're here in person.

1467
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:00,914
So do you want the honors

1468
01:33:00,952 --> 01:33:02,442
or should I?

1469
01:33:03,655 --> 01:33:05,623
I'll do it.

1470
01:33:05,657 --> 01:33:06,817
In the morning?

1471
01:33:06,858 --> 01:33:08,120
Good.

1472
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:09,854
Get back to me
as soon as you're done.

1473
01:33:09,894 --> 01:33:11,226
Get some rest.
- Okay.

1474
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:20,767
I imagined
those Janissary boys, uprooted,

1475
01:33:20,807 --> 01:33:23,833
landing in new homes
with new fathers...

1476
01:33:23,877 --> 01:33:26,175
some of them good fathers...

1477
01:33:26,213 --> 01:33:28,579
their loyalties terribly divided.

1478
01:33:30,617 --> 01:33:32,847
You're deluding yourself that
you have this role here.

1479
01:33:32,886 --> 01:33:34,376
You don't.

1480
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:36,218
You don't.
Go home, Bobby.

1481
01:33:37,224 --> 01:33:38,223
Go home?

1482
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:40,648
Go home?

1483
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:42,490
Do you have any fucking idea

1484
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:44,122
what happens to your family
if I go home?

1485
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:45,291
Huh?

1486
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,561
Once they snatch you

1487
01:33:46,601 --> 01:33:51,266
and drop your ass in a cell
in Peshawar...

1488
01:33:51,306 --> 01:33:52,864
Seven more students arrested.

1489
01:33:52,908 --> 01:33:53,897
We must protest.

1490
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:02,774
Brothers, please listen!

1491
01:34:02,818 --> 01:34:04,080
Everyone, listen to me!

1492
01:34:04,119 --> 01:34:07,282
Hussain, do what you must,

1493
01:34:07,322 --> 01:34:09,119
but do it peacefully.

1494
01:34:09,158 --> 01:34:10,955
Remember, no violence.

1495
01:34:10,993 --> 01:34:13,257
- Sir, observing situation.
Stand by.

1496
01:34:13,295 --> 01:34:14,422
Copy that.

1497
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:23,532
You know, my capacity
for evaluation

1498
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:25,007
hasn't diminished, Bobby.

1499
01:34:25,042 --> 01:34:27,306
You know what I see before me?

1500
01:34:27,344 --> 01:34:30,973
I see a man with hash
under his fingernails

1501
01:34:31,015 --> 01:34:34,416
who likely smokes it alone.

1502
01:34:34,452 --> 01:34:36,215
I see the odd white man

1503
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:38,312
who lives in the old quarter

1504
01:34:38,355 --> 01:34:39,515
and only ventures out

1505
01:34:39,557 --> 01:34:41,821
to buy local food
and local girls...

1506
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:44,824
Who's been here so long

1507
01:34:44,862 --> 01:34:46,558
his own blood family
have forgotten him.

1508
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:48,589
And there's nobody here
to replace them.

1509
01:34:49,901 --> 01:34:51,869
You're playing a dangerous game,
Changez.

1510
01:34:51,903 --> 01:34:54,998
- I'm sorry.
I'm just...

1511
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:58,033
I'm telling you something

1512
01:34:58,077 --> 01:35:00,341
that it took me a long time
to realize.

1513
01:35:01,848 --> 01:35:03,509
Some truths take their time.

1514
01:35:08,921 --> 01:35:11,185
I was just coming to see you.

1515
01:35:11,224 --> 01:35:13,351
Interesting message you left me.

1516
01:35:13,392 --> 01:35:15,417
You're not letting him go?
What the hell does that mean?

1517
01:35:15,461 --> 01:35:18,863
It means that I'm not
gonna fire Nazmi Kemal.

1518
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:22,198
And, in fact, I'm not gonna do
any more evaluations.

1519
01:35:22,236 --> 01:35:23,703
I'm quitting the firm, Jim.

1520
01:35:23,737 --> 01:35:25,330
You accepted the position
of associate

1521
01:35:25,373 --> 01:35:26,567
less than three months ago.

1522
01:35:26,608 --> 01:35:28,667
You leave now,
you'll be giving up all hope

1523
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:30,644
of ever doing this kind of work
again anywhere.

1524
01:35:30,678 --> 01:35:32,612
You'd be committing
professional suicide.

1525
01:35:34,048 --> 01:35:35,811
I know I've let you down, Jim,

1526
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,784
and I'm deeply sorry for that.

1527
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:40,049
But I have to tell you
that I'm through.

1528
01:35:40,088 --> 01:35:41,316
You're telling me?

1529
01:35:41,356 --> 01:35:42,550
You don't tell me!

1530
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:43,648
Can we be civil, Jim?

1531
01:35:43,691 --> 01:35:45,386
You think you're the only person

1532
01:35:45,426 --> 01:35:48,020
who's experienced
injustice firsthand?

1533
01:35:48,062 --> 01:35:49,826
Throw a rock out there
anywhere in this city,

1534
01:35:49,865 --> 01:35:51,332
and it'll land on the grave
of someone

1535
01:35:51,367 --> 01:35:52,857
who's seen worse than you.

1536
01:35:52,902 --> 01:35:55,666
Now, maybe you're having
some kind of a breakdown.

1537
01:35:55,704 --> 01:35:57,798
I will see to it that you
will get some rest

1538
01:35:57,841 --> 01:35:59,103
after this is done.

1539
01:35:59,142 --> 01:36:00,939
But you will treat
my commitment to you

1540
01:36:00,977 --> 01:36:03,741
with the respect
that it deserves!

1541
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:06,340
And to myself as well.

1542
01:36:06,383 --> 01:36:08,943
I have a commitment to myself.

1543
01:36:10,287 --> 01:36:12,687
Do you want to be an insurance
salesman, Changez,

1544
01:36:12,722 --> 01:36:13,950
with a mortgage
and a migraine?

1545
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:15,685
Is that the life you envision
for yourself?

1546
01:36:15,725 --> 01:36:16,749
As opposed to what?

1547
01:36:16,793 --> 01:36:18,818
I have to live in truth.

1548
01:36:18,862 --> 01:36:20,329
You taught me, Jim.

1549
01:36:20,363 --> 01:36:21,695
You put your fucking shoes on,

1550
01:36:21,732 --> 01:36:22,994
and you go down to that office,

1551
01:36:23,034 --> 01:36:25,594
and you do the job
you were hired to do!

1552
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:31,031
It's not my job anymore.

1553
01:36:38,984 --> 01:36:42,943
# Hear me out, O, Lord... #

1554
01:36:46,959 --> 01:36:50,918
# It was you, true Lord, who said... #

1555
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:58,960
# Man, you are king of the world... #

1556
01:37:11,452 --> 01:37:13,750
What's he gonna do?

1557
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:14,913
About time.

1558
01:37:21,428 --> 01:37:22,588
Fidel.

1559
01:37:24,832 --> 01:37:26,733
Is this about me beating you
in basketball?

1560
01:37:30,939 --> 01:37:33,067
You're gonna be a great analyst,
Wainwright.

1561
01:37:35,378 --> 01:37:37,403
What are you gonna be?

1562
01:37:42,118 --> 01:37:43,745
Yes, I read the perspectives,
and more importantly...

1563
01:37:43,786 --> 01:37:47,586
# A fine king You made,
O Lord... #

1564
01:37:51,727 --> 01:37:55,686
# Who endures life's blows
with grace... #

1565
01:37:59,036 --> 01:38:03,234
# I don't want this kingdom, Lord... #

1566
01:38:07,512 --> 01:38:11,471
# All I want is a grain of respect... #

1567
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,020
# Hear me out, O Lord #

1568
01:38:26,064 --> 01:38:30,024
# Heed my plea,
and I'll heed Yours... #

1569
01:38:38,478 --> 01:38:42,505
# Curse me if I break this vow... #

1570
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:47,282
# If this pact displeases You... #

1571
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:51,279
# Then let me find
another God... #

1572
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,091
- Hey.
- Hi.

1573
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:11,143
Ah, you're...
you're moving.

1574
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:14,740
Yeah.

1575
01:39:23,225 --> 01:39:26,217
I should have told you
what I'd been working on.

1576
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:29,927
I wanted to let you in
more than I did.

1577
01:39:29,965 --> 01:39:32,593
It's just, everything
about falling in love with you,

1578
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:35,468
Changez, it hurt so much.

1579
01:39:39,343 --> 01:39:41,004
- It's okay.
I understand.

1580
01:39:43,714 --> 01:39:44,942
I'm sorry about what I said.

1581
01:39:44,982 --> 01:39:46,040
Oh.

1582
01:39:56,794 --> 01:39:59,524
You're going back to Pakistan?

1583
01:39:59,563 --> 01:40:01,258
I have no job, no visa.

1584
01:40:01,298 --> 01:40:03,459
I have to leave the country
within two weeks.

1585
01:40:05,703 --> 01:40:06,863
You want to come?

1586
01:40:15,614 --> 01:40:16,774
Yes.

1587
01:40:22,521 --> 01:40:24,853
But my iddat isn't over yet.

1588
01:42:06,064 --> 01:42:07,895
You haven't eaten in two days.

1589
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:45,236
Good to see you, Mr. Khan.

1590
01:42:45,273 --> 01:42:47,070
And you, Professor Rainier.

1591
01:42:47,108 --> 01:42:50,078
We've experienced an exodus
of foreign professors

1592
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:53,047
from Lahore in the past
several months.

1593
01:42:53,082 --> 01:42:54,743
I need an answer quickly.

1594
01:42:56,785 --> 01:42:59,049
So two months ago,

1595
01:42:59,088 --> 01:43:01,056
I was sitting in my office

1596
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:03,991
on the 53rd floor of a
Manhattan skyscraper.

1597
01:43:04,026 --> 01:43:05,960
I was living my dream...

1598
01:43:05,995 --> 01:43:07,189
the American dream.

1599
01:43:08,397 --> 01:43:10,365
So now I'm back.

1600
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:11,764
What I'd like your help with is,

1601
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,931
is there a Pakistani dream?

1602
01:43:22,513 --> 01:43:24,174
One that doesn't involve emigrating.

1603
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:31,421
It seems we...

1604
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:33,923
we put out our begging bowl
to other countries.

1605
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,256
We do exactly
what they tell us to do,

1606
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:38,523
and then we despise them for it.

1607
01:43:38,562 --> 01:43:40,587
After a while, we start
to despise ourselves for it.

1608
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:41,689
I know I did.

1609
01:43:41,732 --> 01:43:44,496
If we wish to be self-reliant...

1610
01:43:44,535 --> 01:43:46,230
We need to talk about taxes.

1611
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:49,035
So you were talking
about options.

1612
01:43:49,074 --> 01:43:51,304
What are the options
for Pakistan right now?

1613
01:43:52,979 --> 01:43:55,277
Would you like to join us
at one of our meetings?

1614
01:43:57,283 --> 01:43:58,409
If you look at the stats,

1615
01:43:58,451 --> 01:44:00,385
we don't actually tax
our population.

1616
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,012
So let's start
on the national level,

1617
01:44:02,055 --> 01:44:03,989
and we'll break it down to personal.

1618
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:08,652
The only way the government...
- Khan.

1619
01:44:16,069 --> 01:44:18,435
I'd like to introduce Mustafa Fazil.

1620
01:44:18,471 --> 01:44:20,463
This is Professor Changez Khan.

1621
01:44:40,762 --> 01:44:42,320
Talk to me, Bobby.
What's going on?

1622
01:44:42,363 --> 01:44:44,524
It's called progress.
It takes time.

1623
01:44:44,566 --> 01:44:46,363
Time's up, pal.
I've got to get you out of here.

1624
01:44:46,401 --> 01:44:48,892
I don't need a second American
kidnapped today.

1625
01:44:48,937 --> 01:44:51,668
Students, cooperate
with the police or else!

1626
01:44:51,707 --> 01:44:53,834
Free the students!

1627
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:56,903
Out, America, out!

1628
01:45:01,284 --> 01:45:02,876
- Sir, are you all right?
- Yeah...

1629
01:45:02,919 --> 01:45:05,114
The students are fired up.
It's explosive.

1630
01:45:05,155 --> 01:45:06,383
If you come busting in here now,

1631
01:45:06,423 --> 01:45:07,890
you're gonna blow everything.

1632
01:45:07,924 --> 01:45:09,391
He's gonna lead us to Fazil.
I know it.

1633
01:45:09,426 --> 01:45:11,053
If you don't have a location
on Rainier,

1634
01:45:11,094 --> 01:45:13,085
we're wasting time;
I'm coming in.

1635
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:14,927
I need you to go out there
and keep them calm for me.

1636
01:45:14,965 --> 01:45:16,159
They don't listen to me.

1637
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:18,030
And your family is really
worried about you.

1638
01:45:18,068 --> 01:45:19,797
Tell them I'm fine.

1639
01:45:19,836 --> 01:45:21,201
Phone them.

1640
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:22,205
Stay low.

1641
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:23,366
Cooper, no.

1642
01:45:23,407 --> 01:45:25,136
Coop?

1643
01:45:25,176 --> 01:45:26,302
We're going in!

1644
01:45:29,615 --> 01:45:31,344
Everything okay?

1645
01:45:31,383 --> 01:45:32,475
What's going on?

1646
01:45:32,518 --> 01:45:33,644
It's okay.

1647
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:37,012
We need to talk...

1648
01:45:38,724 --> 01:45:39,850
Alone.

1649
01:45:54,941 --> 01:45:56,135
Are the police cooperating?

1650
01:45:56,176 --> 01:45:57,336
Don't count on it.

1651
01:46:00,214 --> 01:46:01,875
Go! Go!
Go!

1652
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:03,850
Go, go, go!

1653
01:46:11,258 --> 01:46:13,021
We need to talk about Anse Rainier.

1654
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:14,254
Okay, let's talk about him.

1655
01:46:14,295 --> 01:46:15,922
Have you seen all the rumors
in the newspapers?

1656
01:46:15,963 --> 01:46:17,828
Do you know what the students
are saying about him?

1657
01:46:17,865 --> 01:46:18,991
Look, Changez,

1658
01:46:19,033 --> 01:46:20,830
an extraction team
is on their way here.

1659
01:46:20,868 --> 01:46:22,165
If you don't give me something...

1660
01:46:22,203 --> 01:46:23,363
Call it off!

1661
01:46:26,073 --> 01:46:27,132
Bobby, what do you think

1662
01:46:27,175 --> 01:46:28,699
is going to happen
when they get here?

1663
01:46:28,743 --> 01:46:31,770
Do you think all these young men
are just gonna stand idly by?

1664
01:46:31,814 --> 01:46:32,940
all: Out, police, out!

1665
01:46:32,982 --> 01:46:34,176
Out, police, out!

1666
01:46:34,217 --> 01:46:35,241
Huh?

1667
01:46:35,284 --> 01:46:36,546
You need to ask yourself
if you think

1668
01:46:36,586 --> 01:46:39,077
all those lives are worth
risking to save one.

1669
01:46:40,423 --> 01:46:41,913
Who is Anse Rainier?

1670
01:46:43,159 --> 01:46:45,491
He's an academic.

1671
01:46:45,528 --> 01:46:47,621
He teaches English to orphans
on his day off.

1672
01:46:47,663 --> 01:46:50,689
The guy doesn't have
a violent bone in his body.

1673
01:46:50,733 --> 01:46:53,361
He read my galleys
for the Massoud book.

1674
01:46:53,402 --> 01:46:55,927
He's a friend, a mentor,
like Jim Cross was to you.

1675
01:46:55,972 --> 01:46:57,337
If that's true, Bobby,

1676
01:46:57,373 --> 01:46:59,865
you should think very carefully
about who your friends are.

1677
01:47:01,678 --> 01:47:02,941
The only way the government...

1678
01:47:07,085 --> 01:47:08,347
Salaam.

1679
01:47:10,154 --> 01:47:13,180
So you were in America when
they attacked Afghanistan.

1680
01:47:13,224 --> 01:47:14,248
Yes.

1681
01:47:14,292 --> 01:47:15,759
How did you feel

1682
01:47:15,793 --> 01:47:17,886
when you saw the bombs dropping

1683
01:47:17,929 --> 01:47:19,954
on your brothers and sisters?

1684
01:47:20,965 --> 01:47:22,125
I felt angry.

1685
01:47:23,334 --> 01:47:26,394
Yeah, Americans speak of equality,

1686
01:47:26,437 --> 01:47:31,137
then take 100 Muslim lives
to avenge 1 life of their own.

1687
01:47:31,176 --> 01:47:34,340
They speak of democracy,

1688
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:37,350
then support kings and dictators.

1689
01:47:37,384 --> 01:47:39,011
Changez...

1690
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:44,450
You have an office
in the faculty building.

1691
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:45,480
Yes, I do.

1692
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:46,685
Changez...

1693
01:47:49,829 --> 01:47:55,131
Many Muslims can
sympathize passively.

1694
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:57,966
A mujahid acts.

1695
01:48:00,573 --> 01:48:03,042
There are items,

1696
01:48:03,077 --> 01:48:05,307
tools of resistance,

1697
01:48:05,346 --> 01:48:09,215
that we would like to store
in your office.

1698
01:48:11,753 --> 01:48:12,913
Yeah.

1699
01:48:14,690 --> 01:48:19,127
A wise and effective mujahid

1700
01:48:19,161 --> 01:48:22,995
appears to the enemy
as a negotiable man.

1701
01:48:24,032 --> 01:48:26,296
He hides behind masks.

1702
01:48:27,669 --> 01:48:29,933
Wear this mask for us, Changez.

1703
01:48:31,606 --> 01:48:34,599
I'm asking you
to join the fight.

1704
01:48:39,917 --> 01:48:42,579
I was his for the taking.

1705
01:48:42,619 --> 01:48:44,644
I had seen firsthand
the arrogant America

1706
01:48:44,688 --> 01:48:46,553
he described,

1707
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:47,682
the blindness,

1708
01:48:47,725 --> 01:48:50,990
the hypocrisy, the xenophobia.

1709
01:48:51,028 --> 01:48:52,461
My anger had congealed,

1710
01:48:52,496 --> 01:48:55,363
hardened by injustice
and disappointment.

1711
01:48:55,399 --> 01:48:57,424
Of course I would fight.

1712
01:48:57,468 --> 01:49:00,062
Of course I would bleed the enemy.

1713
01:49:00,104 --> 01:49:03,073
But then he used that word...

1714
01:49:03,107 --> 01:49:05,234
Our only hope as a people

1715
01:49:05,275 --> 01:49:07,904
are the fundamental truths

1716
01:49:07,946 --> 01:49:09,778
given to us in the Q'uran.

1717
01:49:12,952 --> 01:49:17,582
We do that by focusing
on the fundamentals.

1718
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,024
With due respect...

1719
01:49:33,172 --> 01:49:36,232
These young men were engaged
in their own valuation,

1720
01:49:36,275 --> 01:49:38,005
just like Underwood Samson,

1721
01:49:38,044 --> 01:49:42,004
moving human beings in and out
of binary columns:

1722
01:49:42,049 --> 01:49:46,110
worker, liability, American, Pakistani,

1723
01:49:46,154 --> 01:49:50,989
martyr, infidel, alive, dead.

1724
01:49:51,025 --> 01:49:53,994
I was tired of the reduction.

1725
01:49:54,028 --> 01:49:56,496
I was tired of deciding
from a distant perch

1726
01:49:56,531 --> 01:49:58,692
the fate of people
I did not know.

1727
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:02,463
Yes, I'm a Pakistani.

1728
01:50:02,503 --> 01:50:03,902
Yes, I'm a Muslim.

1729
01:50:03,938 --> 01:50:06,907
Yes, I'm an opponent of
your country's assault on mine.

1730
01:50:06,941 --> 01:50:09,273
But that's not all I am.

1731
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,370
We're both more
than these things, Bobby.

1732
01:50:13,082 --> 01:50:15,550
And I've never taken up arms,
and I never will,

1733
01:50:15,585 --> 01:50:19,316
so please, tell them
to leave my family alone.

1734
01:50:28,565 --> 01:50:29,862
Hey!

1735
01:50:29,899 --> 01:50:30,957
Hand me those petrol bombs!

1736
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,024
Wait a minute.

1737
01:50:32,068 --> 01:50:33,467
What's going on?

1738
01:50:33,503 --> 01:50:34,697
Where are you going?

1739
01:50:34,737 --> 01:50:36,830
Rainier's fate is not in my hands.

1740
01:50:36,873 --> 01:50:38,500
Stop all this!

1741
01:50:38,541 --> 01:50:39,667
Changez.

1742
01:50:39,709 --> 01:50:42,178
Hey, Changez!
Wait!

1743
01:50:42,213 --> 01:50:45,650
Police dogs!
Servants of America!

1744
01:50:54,226 --> 01:50:55,853
- Listen!
- I've said all I had to say.

1745
01:50:55,894 --> 01:50:58,021
I heard you back there.
I did.

1746
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:04,398
I'm tired of taking sides too.

1747
01:51:04,436 --> 01:51:05,835
I just want to bring
my friend home.

1748
01:51:05,871 --> 01:51:07,498
When you picked a side
after 9/11,

1749
01:51:07,539 --> 01:51:08,733
you said they came to you.

1750
01:51:08,773 --> 01:51:10,502
So who invited you
to join the fight?

1751
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:11,873
It was your friend, wasn't it?

1752
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:14,141
Professor Rainier
was in Afghanistan in 2001.

1753
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:15,841
I remember him talking about it.

1754
01:51:16,917 --> 01:51:17,975
Just tell me the truth!

1755
01:51:18,018 --> 01:51:19,280
You know the truth!

1756
01:51:19,319 --> 01:51:21,913
Rainier brought me in.
He was a case officer.

1757
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:25,089
No, wait!
Wait, Changez.

1758
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:26,854
Wait.

1759
01:51:26,894 --> 01:51:29,522
We can stop this right now,
you and me.

1760
01:51:29,563 --> 01:51:30,860
If that extraction team
comes in here,

1761
01:51:30,898 --> 01:51:32,866
all hell's gonna break loose,
and you know it.

1762
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,333
Do you have any idea
what it means

1763
01:51:34,368 --> 01:51:37,132
for me to help the CIA
in my own country?

1764
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:39,035
Please, Changez.

1765
01:51:39,072 --> 01:51:41,336
Try to see the man.

1766
01:51:41,375 --> 01:51:44,435
He has a wife... her name's Alissa...

1767
01:51:44,478 --> 01:51:46,572
and two small girls,
Sophie and Molly.

1768
01:51:46,614 --> 01:51:48,082
Let me call them, please.

1769
01:51:48,117 --> 01:51:50,711
Let me call them and tell them
that he's safe.

1770
01:51:50,753 --> 01:51:52,050
I can't.
I can't.

1771
01:51:52,087 --> 01:51:54,715
Sir, the cops are roughing up
the students.

1772
01:51:54,757 --> 01:51:56,054
Only you can control them!

1773
01:51:56,091 --> 01:51:57,422
I'll be right there.

1774
01:51:57,459 --> 01:51:59,256
I'm coming!

1775
01:51:59,295 --> 01:52:01,695
Then do it for your students,
for their future,

1776
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:03,561
because you and I both agree
they deserve one.

1777
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:23,882
There's a butcher's shop
near Sheranwala Gate.

1778
01:52:23,921 --> 01:52:25,445
I've heard a student
talk about it.

1779
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:27,286
There's a back room.

1780
01:52:27,325 --> 01:52:28,952
You can only get to it
through the freezer.

1781
01:52:28,993 --> 01:52:30,893
I heard Asal Mujahideen
sometimes use it.

1782
01:52:33,197 --> 01:52:34,357
Now call them off.

1783
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,560
Thank you.

1784
01:52:40,972 --> 01:52:42,132
You did the right thing.

1785
01:52:45,943 --> 01:52:47,672
I'm calling it in.
Don't move.

1786
01:52:52,418 --> 01:52:54,579
Get out!
The police!

1787
01:52:56,789 --> 01:52:58,154
Stay calm!

1788
01:52:58,191 --> 01:52:59,920
No one go outside!

1789
01:52:59,959 --> 01:53:01,290
Junaid, calm them down.

1790
01:53:01,327 --> 01:53:03,090
Don't worry, sir.

1791
01:53:03,129 --> 01:53:05,689
Sameer, go outside.
Calm them.

1792
01:53:05,732 --> 01:53:06,960
Amreh, hello?

1793
01:53:08,668 --> 01:53:11,296
Amreh, I know where Rainier is.

1794
01:53:11,337 --> 01:53:12,770
You're cutting out.

1795
01:53:12,805 --> 01:53:14,796
What?

1796
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:15,899
Bobby, can you hear me?

1797
01:53:15,942 --> 01:53:17,432
At Sheranwala... hello?

1798
01:53:17,477 --> 01:53:18,466
Bobby, can you...

1799
01:53:18,511 --> 01:53:21,037
Police have been warned
and will assist.

1800
01:53:22,683 --> 01:53:25,346
At Sheran... hello?

1801
01:53:25,387 --> 01:53:26,718
Fuck.

1802
01:53:26,755 --> 01:53:29,451
Brothers, listen to me, please!

1803
01:53:38,533 --> 01:53:41,593
Everything's okay.
Sit down.

1804
01:53:41,636 --> 01:53:42,898
Did you call them off?

1805
01:54:18,909 --> 01:54:20,877
Who were you texting?

1806
01:54:20,911 --> 01:54:22,344
My sister.

1807
01:54:22,379 --> 01:54:23,903
Show me your phone, Changez.

1808
01:54:23,947 --> 01:54:25,040
What?

1809
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:26,312
Show me your phone.

1810
01:54:26,351 --> 01:54:27,511
Why?

1811
01:54:31,223 --> 01:54:33,783
Put your hands on the counter.

1812
01:54:33,826 --> 01:54:34,918
What are you doing?

1813
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,052
He has a gun!
He has a gun!

1814
01:54:36,095 --> 01:54:37,926
What a fucker!

1815
01:54:37,963 --> 01:54:39,828
Move!

1816
01:54:39,865 --> 01:54:40,832
Get it?

1817
01:54:40,866 --> 01:54:41,924
What are you doing?

1818
01:54:41,967 --> 01:54:43,958
Put your fucking hands
on the counter now.

1819
01:54:48,807 --> 01:54:50,274
Get back!

1820
01:54:50,309 --> 01:54:52,470
Fool!
He has a gun!

1821
01:54:57,584 --> 01:55:00,383
What the fuck are
you doing, Bobby?

1822
01:55:00,421 --> 01:55:02,048
You texted your sister, huh?

1823
01:55:02,089 --> 01:55:03,215
Yes, I did.

1824
01:55:03,257 --> 01:55:04,747
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1825
01:55:04,792 --> 01:55:06,225
Then what the fuck is this?

1826
01:55:09,463 --> 01:55:11,397
Why, Changez?

1827
01:55:11,432 --> 01:55:12,592
Why?

1828
01:55:15,569 --> 01:55:16,866
Kept us nice and busy

1829
01:55:16,904 --> 01:55:18,565
while you gave your pals
a head start, didn't you?

1830
01:55:18,606 --> 01:55:20,233
Huh?

1831
01:55:20,274 --> 01:55:22,538
You're making a mistake
that's gonna get us both killed.

1832
01:55:22,576 --> 01:55:23,736
Just give me your phone.

1833
01:55:25,846 --> 01:55:27,313
Get back!

1834
01:55:32,555 --> 01:55:35,023
Let's go, real slow.

1835
01:55:35,057 --> 01:55:38,220
Back!

1836
01:55:38,261 --> 01:55:39,457
Step back!

1837
01:55:40,689 --> 01:55:41,678
Step back!

1838
01:55:45,835 --> 01:55:48,497
Professor Khan is in danger!

1839
01:55:52,809 --> 01:55:54,538
You're gonna get us
both killed, Bobby.

1840
01:55:57,013 --> 01:55:59,607
all: Professor! Professor!

1841
01:56:05,156 --> 01:56:06,145
Step back!

1842
01:56:07,358 --> 01:56:08,518
Step back!

1843
01:56:12,730 --> 01:56:14,254
We're with you, brother!

1844
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:20,601
Move!

1845
01:56:21,639 --> 01:56:22,697
Ah!

1846
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:27,990
Sameer!

1847
01:56:28,449 --> 01:56:29,396
Sameer!

1848
01:56:33,954 --> 01:56:35,717
Step back!
Step back!

1849
01:56:35,755 --> 01:56:37,518
Just secure Bobby and
get the hell back here.

1850
01:56:37,557 --> 01:56:38,717
Go, go, go!

1851
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,541
We got you, Bobby!

1852
01:57:07,089 --> 01:57:08,989
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1853
01:57:36,152 --> 01:57:37,279
Come on!

1854
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:41,485
What the fuck happened?

1855
01:57:41,525 --> 01:57:42,992
He gave us away.

1856
01:57:43,027 --> 01:57:44,892
I caught him texting when
I went to get my phone.

1857
01:57:44,929 --> 01:57:46,362
That's why they killed Anse.

1858
01:57:46,397 --> 01:57:48,627
- When?
- Ah!

1859
01:57:48,666 --> 01:57:49,758
15 minutes ago.

1860
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,665
- No, we found Rainier.
- I know. I know.

1861
01:57:51,702 --> 01:57:53,465
A butcher shop at Sheranwala Gate.

1862
01:57:53,504 --> 01:57:55,131
What are you talking about?

1863
01:57:55,172 --> 01:57:57,037
We found Rainier in a
morgue in Karachi.

1864
01:57:57,074 --> 01:57:58,769
We got word 20 minutes ago,

1865
01:57:58,809 --> 01:58:01,573
but he was dumped there
this morning.

1866
01:58:01,612 --> 01:58:04,604
This morning?
Shit.

1867
01:58:04,648 --> 01:58:07,550
Local intelligence verified
that Changez rejected Fazil.

1868
01:58:07,585 --> 01:58:08,746
We misread him.

1869
01:58:14,827 --> 01:58:15,919
Shit.

1870
01:59:12,055 --> 01:59:16,424
Sameer's parents wish me
to address you.

1871
01:59:16,459 --> 01:59:20,759
They understand
our strong emotion.

1872
01:59:21,798 --> 01:59:24,460
Emotions give us courage.

1873
01:59:29,305 --> 01:59:35,107
I have another message
from his family.

1874
01:59:35,145 --> 01:59:39,013
If our innocent, smiling Sameer
could hear it...

1875
01:59:43,321 --> 01:59:45,221
He would fully agree.

1876
01:59:46,992 --> 01:59:52,555
They ask us not to cry
for their son.

1877
01:59:52,597 --> 01:59:55,930
Too many tears have flowed
into the river.

1878
02:00:01,907 --> 02:00:06,537
They ask us not to take revenge
in their son's name.

1879
02:00:08,947 --> 02:00:11,711
Too much blood has
flowed into that river.

1880
02:00:16,056 --> 02:00:18,684
They ask us not to curse fate.

1881
02:00:20,027 --> 02:00:22,495
Allah holds our son
in His embrace.

1882
02:00:35,175 --> 02:00:36,733
Wipe your tears!

1883
02:00:38,045 --> 02:00:41,708
And pray for a future

1884
02:00:41,748 --> 02:00:43,875
free of dictators and tyrants...

1885
02:00:45,018 --> 02:00:47,750
Free of all invaders.

1886
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:51,487
Come, bring your loved ones.

1887
02:00:51,527 --> 02:00:57,159
Go tell the majestic sun
to preserve its precious rays.

1888
02:00:57,199 --> 02:01:01,295
We'll teach the core of our own
beings to glow with its light.

1889
02:01:20,658 --> 02:01:23,149
Would you please listen
to the whole story,

1890
02:01:23,194 --> 02:01:25,424
not just bits and pieces?

1891
02:01:25,463 --> 02:01:27,055
Do I have your word?

1892
02:01:27,098 --> 02:01:28,395
You do.

1893
02:01:30,001 --> 02:01:31,491
Looks can be deceiving.

1894
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:35,899
I am a lover of America.
