1
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:31,378
“By closing the eyes.“
“By passing over.“

2
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:36,381
“By closing the eyes.“
“By passing over.“

3
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,884
"“Children who never see,
will come on seeing this."

4
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:45,219
“Come by touching the hand or the leg of
the girl who is standing on that side.“

5
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:50,124
“Come by touching
the hand or the leg.“

6
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,769
“It's getting late.“
“It's getting late.“

7
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,373
“By hiding behind the tree.“

8
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:07,562
“When I went there..“
“..the hut was made.“

9
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:12,953
“By closing the eyes.“
“By passing over.“

10
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:18,091
“By closing the eyes.“
“By passing over.“

11
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,665
One, Two, Three, Four, Five.

12
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,500
Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten.

13
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:35,841
Good morning, Palunni. (Milkman).

14
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,105
Oh, good morning.

15
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,112
By hearing you call me "Palunni"..

16
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,463
Now the villagers have also
started calling me that.

17
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:45,781
I have a nice name,
Unnikrishnan KK.

18
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,181
Yes.

19
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,687
Neduparambil Sekharan's
son Unnikrishnan.

20
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,054
Sarojini teacher's son Unnikrishnan.

21
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,194
President Sivan sir's son Unnikrishnan.

22
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:58,264
For taking you from these,
Unnikrishnan, this is better.

23
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:01,458
Palunni. The milk is over there.
Unni is over there.

24
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:05,300
Anyway, it's good that you haven't
started the soil business.

25
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,105
If so, then..

26
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:08,401
No. No.

27
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,299
Take this.

28
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:13,245
Rs. 42 from sister Radhamani
including yesterday's amount.

29
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,541
Rs. 38 from Karaparampil.

30
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,383
That master Chacko hasn't
given last month's payment.

31
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:18,407
Remind him.

32
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:24,986
- Elsamma.
- Yes.

33
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,492
That Papachan came back.

34
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,427
You tell him to give the previous
balance of Rs. 324.

35
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,941
If you try, it might be possible.

36
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,228
I Will do that.

37
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:35,935
You have written that amount
as bad debts.

38
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,961
If you get it, give me half of it. Agreed?
Yes.

39
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,572
Okay. Okay.

40
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:45,610
“The village has awaken.“
“The flowers have opened their eyes.“

41
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:54,852
“The village has awaken.“
“The flowers have opened their eyes.“

42
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:59,493
“Hey, girl, naughty girl.“
“Fly away from here immediately.“

43
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:03,755
“The rooster will ring
the wake up alarm.“

44
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:08,333
“It will come today, tomorrow..“
“It will come in thousands.“

45
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:12,973
“It will come today, tomorrow..“
“It will come in thousands.“

46
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:20,171
“An offer will come for you
at any time now.“

47
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,781
“It's getting late.“
“It's getting late.“

48
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:36,293
“By hiding behind the tree.“

49
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:44,486
“When I went there..“
“..the hut was made.“

50
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,819
“Hey, little cat.“
“Hey, naughty cat.“

51
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,321
“You look like a lazy cat.“

52
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:13,431
“I will bring fish for you when
the pond dries up.“

53
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:18,003
“Hey, dove, come wearing
new white clothes.“

54
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:22,232
“Hey, sun, come wearing a red sari.“

55
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:26,903
“It will come today, tomorrow..“
“It will come in thousands.“

56
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:31,415
“It will come today, tomorrow..“
“It will come in thousands.“

57
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:38,684
“An offer will come for you
at any time now.“

58
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:50,304
“It's getting late.“
“It's getting late.“

59
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,839
“By hiding behind the tree.“

60
00:06:55,031 --> 00:07:03,031
“When I went there..“
“..the hut was made.“

61
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,386
“By closing the eyes.“
“By passing over.“

62
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:13,084
“By closing the eyes.“
“By passing over.“

63
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:18,163
“By closing the eyes.“
“By passing over.“

64
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,870
Keep it.

65
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,075
- Ready?
- Ready?

66
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,211
Hey.

67
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,691
God. Not me. These people.

68
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,882
Hey, stop there.

69
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,154
Run.

70
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,456
Hit the right place.

71
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,098
I'll take a paper to write letter.

72
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,203
Anyway, make sure that Elsamma
doesn't come to know about this.

73
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:58,705
What if she comes to know?

74
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,672
If she comes to know about this,
then the next day's

75
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:03,442
breaking news will be that the village council
president Remanan has hit the hip of Omana.

76
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,070
News is creating leaders.

77
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,042
One tea.

78
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,873
I haven't eaten anything.
Don't eat.

79
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,849
The outside world is now learning about
Balan Pillai because I'm creating news.

80
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:16,455
Balan Pillai city doesn't need
that kind of bad publicity.

81
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:21,959
In 1975, the news about this place
had come in the newspaper.

82
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,468
Sir, you are new to this place,
that's why I'm telling you.

83
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:32,473
I'm the only person who has
a city in my own name.

84
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,573
You might have heard. Balan Pillai.

85
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:38,904
When I started a tea stall here,
Elsamma's father Pookala.

86
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:44,312
Varkey wrote Balan Pillai city under
the board of Balan Pillai tea shop.

87
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,487
We will remove that name.

88
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,183
We have found a new name.
I won't allow that.

89
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,119
We don't need anyone's consent.

90
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:52,657
What is the new name, member?

91
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:56,352
There is a city in the Secretariat.
Thiruvananthapuram.

92
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:58,327
Smart city.

93
00:08:58,554 --> 00:08:59,658
I will put that name.

94
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,130
We haven't eaten anything.

95
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,769
Give them what they want.

96
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,907
If they won't get eggs, they will
create some other problem.

97
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,439
Jose's bill is Rs. 47.50.

98
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,510
RS. 47.50.

99
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,405
Write it in my account.

100
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:15,139
You don't have any account here.

101
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,340
So this new account is being opened.

102
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,180
Don't cheat me by writing
in the account.

103
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:29,477
Central.

104
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,433
Member Remanan has inaugurated Kariya
Parambil ltti Memorial Football match.

105
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,340
There's news here.
I will give the photo aftenlvards.

106
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,434
- Sorry, member.
- What?

107
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:44,976
I have instructions from
Kozhikode office that I should..

108
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,148
Put only one news about
member Remanan.

109
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,407
What is that news?

110
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,278
The ninth ward member
Remanan passed away.

111
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,544
Oh.. When?

112
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:54,796
What nonsense are you blabbering?

113
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,322
As it is, villagers say that you
have an extra bone.

114
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,847
That's true.

115
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:01,485
If I write my name "Elsamma"
in English and Malayalam.

116
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,458
There is one 'L'.

117
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:05,496
That 'L' denotes love. Love. Love.

118
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,000
Love. Nonsense.
What else? Karipalli.

119
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,677
Remanan, did you read
today's newspaper?

120
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,272
What is the use of reading it?
There is no news about me today.

121
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,711
But there is news about me.
Lucky fellow.

122
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:26,785
There is fake liquor flowing in
Karipalli Sugunan's liquor shop.

123
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,512
Destroy everything.

124
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,789
If anyone comes inside,
I will break his head.

125
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,981
Come. Come inside.

126
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,354
If you are a man, then come inside.

127
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:35,618
Let me see your courage.

128
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:36,319
Go inside.

129
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,930
If you have the guts, come inside.

130
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,865
I will break your legs.
Hey, go inside.

131
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,233
I'm the one who brought
them to get blamed.

132
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,258
Very nice.

133
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,195
Hey. You are just a girl.
Just a small girl.

134
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,432
Don't try to be a man.
That's not possible.

135
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,075
If a fish jumps,
it can onlyjump knee-high.

136
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,977
Then if itjumps again, then it will reach..
The basket. The basket.

137
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:55,278
Elsamma will jump.
And I will stand straight again.

138
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,109
For that, there's no need
to be a man.

139
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:58,306
A female can do all this.

140
00:10:58,507 --> 00:10:59,076
Justa girl.

141
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,016
Showing woman power.

142
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,387
This state of Kerala itself is being maintained
because of drunkards and liquor sellers.

143
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,302
Karimpalli Sugunan is the only
liquor seller in this village council.

144
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,129
If you lock that liquor shop
by writing about it,

145
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,731
Then we will have to close down
the village council, too.

146
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,530
I will shut down the liquor
shop at any cost.

147
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,726
Oh, such courage!

148
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,475
SI Sunadappan. Her right hand.
She has agreed to get her transferred.

149
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,621
Because of Remanan's request,
I'm throwing the cycle down.

150
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,654
Anyway, you are our Varkey's daughter.

151
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,413
Leave it. Okay.

152
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,783
What happened, Karipalli?

153
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,829
Have you come here to exact your
revenge after reading the news?

154
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:47,027
Sir, don't say anything like that.
She is our child.

155
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,533
- Right, Daughter?
- Yes.

156
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,432
Sir, you have come here recently.

157
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,765
That's why you don't know.

158
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,669
<i>Her father Pookam Varkey.
Packard?</i>

159
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:59,938
Yes. He would boil medicinal leaves
and coconut flowers.

160
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:00,841
Okay. Okay.

161
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:02,674
After boiling it, he would filter it.

162
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:05,650
Those who would drink that would start
dancing like a flower.

163
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,620
Thus he got the name "Pookala Varkey".

164
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,299
That means that what Elsamma
said is true, right?

165
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,827
You are making fake liquor, right?
That..

166
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,054
Sir, Karippalli's enemies
are saying that.

167
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:19,093
Tell me. Your job is making
fake liquor, right?

168
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,032
Hello. Yes. I've reached.

169
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,631
Sir, you don't go. I'm on the way.

170
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,995
MLA.

171
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:29,508
Hey, Daughter, you call me
if you need any help.

172
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:30,533
Okay.

173
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,144
How are things going on?

174
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,406
Come.

175
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:34,882
- That's your shop, right?
- Yes.

176
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,970
You should vacate that.

177
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,415
Get into the vehicle.
Let's drink a little.

178
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:47,722
Karippalli had offered my father 3 acres of
rubber plantation for making fake liquor.

179
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:52,025
One fine day, Karipalli and my father had
an argument regarding that land.

180
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:55,395
My father died the next day
in an accident.

181
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,634
I doubt that Karipalli did that.

182
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,670
Oh, had such an incident taken place?
Yes.

183
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,671
I didn't know about that.
May I go?

184
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,844
Sir, let's drink one cup of tea. Come.

185
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:04,511
- Brother Sasi.
- Yes.

186
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,700
Come.

187
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,101
Greetings, sir.

188
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,581
Mathachan. Three cups of tea.
Okay.

189
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:10,605
Without for brother Sasi.

190
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:11,740
Serve them fast.

191
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:12,744
Sir.

192
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:16,348
Liquor made from only 15 coconut trees is
being taking to Karipalli's liquor shop.

193
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:18,915
With that much, he won't be
able meet the target.

194
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:21,795
Karipalli is not Jesus to turn
water into wine.

195
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:25,492
If things keep going like this,
a big tragedy will take place here.

196
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:29,365
As long as Sunandappan is the SI here
nothing like that will ever happen.

197
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,767
If you get some information,
you should inform me, Elsamma.

198
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,439
Today onwards, Sugunan and his liquor
shop will be under my observation.

199
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,808
What about my transfer?
I will manage that.

200
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,919
“Oh, Sinaba.“ “My Sinaba.“

201
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:58,997
“Why did you come like a calf?“

202
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:00,633
- Whether I come or not..
- Okay.

203
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,803
Member, you go away without disturbing me.
Okay.

204
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:07,536
“Who is there in your heart, Sinaba?“

205
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,301
“The poem in your heart.“

206
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:13,036
My God. He won't allow
me to do my work.

207
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,112
- Member, now you sweep.
- Yes.

208
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:19,980
“You are the moonlight in
my dream, my dear sweeper.“

209
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,919
“Don't pull her scarf.“

210
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,561
“My dear henna plant.“

211
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,025
Henna.

212
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:32,826
Are you sweeping here?

213
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,223
Hi, Unni.

214
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,765
I have come here to see you, member.
Then see.

215
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:45,312
I have read in the newspaper that
you are giving loans to cattle farmers.

216
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,501
Yes. I am.

217
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,613
Application forms will arrive
tomorrow or the day after.

218
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,383
Fill up that application, take the member's
signature on it and submit it.

219
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,717
Okay. But give a bottle for signing it,
That's the system.

220
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:54,909
For signing it..

221
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:58,223
Bottle. Bottle.
Not a milk bottle. Brandy bottle.

222
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:02,788
Remember that the tea which your drink
is made of has my cow's milk.

223
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,601
If your milk isn't there,
we will bring milk from other states.

224
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,271
Yes. You can do that.
But remember its quality, too.

225
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,238
Earth worms for increasing
the thickness of the milk.

226
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,373
Formalin which is sprayed on
dead bodies to prevent milk decay.

227
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:17,502
Then potassium permanganate.
Caustic soda.

228
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,111
If all these go into the stomach...

229
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,912
Lose motions, vomiting,
digestion problems..

230
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,142
Enough. Enough.

231
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,379
- This many problems?
- Yes.

232
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,179
As a cattle farmer,
what you said might be true.

233
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:30,482
I will consider your application.
But bottle for signing it..

234
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:34,490
Okay-. Okav-

235
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,396
He came to take a free signature.

236
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:37,393
- Member.
- Yes.

237
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,691
Our village council secretary Rajamma sir..

238
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,729
- Rajamma Sir?
- Nothing.

239
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,234
I thought you will be happy
on hearing that name.

240
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:53,861
Central.

241
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,843
Karipalli called me.
Oh, for what?

242
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:04,146
Where is my son George
who was his childhood friend?

243
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,791
He hasn't seen him for a long time.
Do you have his phone number?

244
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,158
We know Karipalli very well.

245
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,091
He won't call me without any reason.

246
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:15,793
When I told him to tell me the matter is, he
told me that Christmas is around the corner.

247
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:20,201
He will get good business this time.
Tell her not to create any problems.

248
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,704
Paappan, then what did you say?

249
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:26,543
I told him that she won't budge even
if Jesus comes and tells her.

250
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,735
Okay.

251
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,611
Paappan, will George come
for this Christmas?

252
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:32,444
What?

253
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,212
Write. Without asking all these things.

254
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:37,888
Why are you shouting at him?

255
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,454
He didn't come for last Christmas either.

256
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,062
Even if he wants to come,
his wife won't allow him to do so.

257
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,564
She started brainwashing him
the day they got married.

258
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,499
She wants him to buy the property in Ernakulam
or Bangalore after selling all this.

259
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,899
She won't like this village.

260
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,570
That's why she left from here.

261
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,209
My ancestors had made this.

262
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:03,816
How can I sell this?
He won't understand that.

263
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:07,146
After marriage, a wife is really important.

264
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,823
It would be a matter of great luck
if he calls me this Christmas.

265
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,258
She was sleeping at
Rajakkad bus stop.

266
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,159
I'm taking her from there.
Go, man.

267
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:20,031
Mother, you will get a bad name
for others, too.

268
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:23,195
Oh, don't make a bad name
for me for delivering you.

269
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,962
- That's for sure.
- Go away.

270
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,700
I was waiting for the bus after leaving
from the church, Dinamma.

271
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,018
It's good that Unni saw you.

272
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,873
Then your father will bring me here.

273
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,045
I have told him to buy some medicines.

274
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,274
My knee hurts.

275
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:41,786
Sister.
We will get Elsamma married soon.

276
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,622
Next Sunday, a boy will come to see her. And
the Sunday after that, will be the engagement.

277
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,458
And the Sunday after that,
will be the wedding.

278
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,291
My God.
The time to get her married is here?

279
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,522
Yes. Decide whom you want.

280
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,166
Puliyanmala Tomy.
Kambilikandan Xavier.

281
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,927
Pattammile Sibi.
He is B.Com, first class.

282
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,867
He knows rubber tapping very well.

283
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,904
He is well suited for Elsamma.

284
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,736
No. He is not good enough
for our Elsamma.

285
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,502
- Please go away.
- No.

286
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,044
She failed in the 10th grade.

287
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,375
She needs a groom who is
much more educated.

288
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:10,891
Yes. My opinion is also the same.

289
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,146
You tell your opinion to
Nedumkandam Vasanthi.

290
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,150
- Nuisance.
- Who is that?

291
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,951
Hasn't your mother told you anything?

292
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:20,892
Next Sunday, you have to go
to see the bride.

293
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,128
Hey, look over here. It's okay
if you are taking Unni along with you.

294
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:27,225
But the bride should be beautiful.
A very beautiful girl.

295
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:30,562
But she is a little damaged
due to wear and tear.

296
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,332
She is just 19. She is slim.

297
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,010
That will be okay after marriage.

298
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:41,812
You don't bring a proposal for me.
I won't come to see the bride.

299
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:43,675
Stop. Stop.

300
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:48,082
Don't lie to Jesus and
marriage brokers. Tell me.

301
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:51,019
Did you made someone
in bottle by giving milk?

302
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,090
Tell. We want to know as well.

303
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,526
If something like that happens,
I will inform you.

304
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,927
That..

305
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:57,823
Brother Thoma.

306
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,665
When you bring a proposal for me,
bring a boy who is a little dark is color.

307
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:01,497
Why so?

308
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,228
If the boy is fair, then he will
feel the black complex.

309
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,806
Give him a little B complex.
Black is beautiful.

310
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:10,101
There's a song as well.

311
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,276
Sreekrishnan who had 10008 wives
is also black in color.

312
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:18,383
Lord Rama, whom Shurpanaha loves,
was also black in color.

313
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,317
The elephant is also black in color.

314
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:26,550
Night is also dark in color.

315
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:30,019
If so, black is beautiful, right?

316
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:31,779
Brother, please write this song for me.

317
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,731
Sure. I will go after giving you this.

318
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:35,556
- Hey.
- Yes.

319
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,735
If you promise not to get shocked,
I will tell you the truth.

320
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,137
- Okay.
- I'm not married.

321
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,132
If you are interested, l..

322
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:44,777
Go. Go. Go. Jesus.

323
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,002
What's the matter, Thoma?

324
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,475
I want to put a marriage
advertisement in newspaper.

325
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,775
- For whom?
- I'll read..

326
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,477
A groom wanted for a beautiful lady
who is working as a nurse in America.

327
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,451
Caste, religion no bar.

328
00:19:56,645 --> 00:20:00,422
Preferably unemployed youth.
Contact Malavalan Thomachan.

329
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,095
Manavalan's marriage bureau.

330
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,957
BP city. Phone,
The phone is there.

331
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,592
Please give this.
Who is the bride?

332
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,029
I'm the bride.

333
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:10,499
Oh, are you going to commit a fraud?
No.

334
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:16,438
The youths who are not ready to work
will call on this number.

335
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:21,445
I will tell them to send Rs. 100 to get
their bio-data, phone number and photo.

336
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,378
They will send that amount at any cost.

337
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:27,019
When they call, I will act
as the bride's father.

338
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,279
Then I will say this.

339
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,787
"Hello, the girl's engagement
is done with, my son."

340
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,481
Thus that will get over with.

341
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,626
We can share the amount equally.
What are you saying?

342
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,650
It's a nice business.

343
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,594
If you commit any fraud by misusing
the nurse's name.

344
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,428
I will file a case against you and
SI Sunandappan will thrash you.

345
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:43,624
Tear it off.

346
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:45,197
I tore it away.

347
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:46,805
Don't make him thrash me.

348
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,395
Tell him to just give me a warning.

349
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,307
I will improve.
I could have said anything.

350
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,206
Come.

351
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:00,545
- Paappa.
- Yes.

352
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:03,222
Elsamma's groom's photo is
being showed there.

353
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,722
Thomachan is showing it.
He is smart.

354
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,252
That means Paappan also
knows about this.

355
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,897
I have brought this after
traveling 5-6 kilometers...

356
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,657
believing the great farmer
Kunnel Paappan's words.

357
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,803
Look here.
I want to know today itself.

358
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,437
Paappan, will you inform her
that I love Elsamma?

359
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,900
I will tell her.
You give me this.

360
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,834
You say this. But you won't tell her.

361
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,276
I'm not even able to sleep well.

362
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,349
Even I don't get good sleep.
That's why I'm drinking this.

363
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,520
Look. Don't say this.

364
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,847
You drink this.

365
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,252
I'm sure that you will look
after Elsamma nicely.

366
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:41,121
That surety is enough for me
to get her married to you.

367
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:43,626
Hold this...
Paappan, I trust you.

368
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,330
I have only one request.

369
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:54,271
Let me live till I conduct her and
her younger sister's marriage.

370
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,890
What are you saying, Paappan?

371
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,876
You will live to see all your grand
children's marriages, too. What happened?

372
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:02,706
Grand children? Grand children.

373
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,442
It's good if they remember
their grand parents.

374
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:12,949
My son's wife alienated his
children from their grandparents.

375
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:16,586
Jesus must have calculated
that time itself that my

376
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:19,493
own son won't be there to
let me have water when I die.

377
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:25,730
That's why I told Pookala Varkey
to stay here on my land.

378
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:29,638
Enough. My Varkey's children
are enough for me.

379
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:31,742
I and Dinamma are happy.

380
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:35,669
Paappan.

381
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:40,579
She won't come to know that her future
husband is a drunkard now itself.

382
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,921
Should I shut down this bar
in the forest?

383
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,320
Or will you do that yourself?

384
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,391
Unni. You are spoiling Paappan a lot.

385
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,757
- I will give you.
- L..

386
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,432
No. He hasn't spoiled me.

387
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,542
Your father Varkey had done that.
Pookala Varkey.

388
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,003
He is innocent. Very innocent.
He won't even touch liquor.

389
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,935
Don't break the glass that
is lying down. Take that.

390
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,613
Don't laugh.

391
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:13,353
I want to talk to you about
something serious.- What?

392
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:18,015
A good proposal has come from Kanjirapally.
Varikkaparambil Lonappan told me.

393
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:21,217
I'm going there the next Sunday.

394
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:22,716
Don't go.

395
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:25,128
I will tell you when I feel
like getting married.

396
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:30,362
Don't do this again.
I've ended our friendship. Good bye.

397
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,506
Hey. Let me tell you something.
Let me tell you, Tell me.

398
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:37,837
I just played a drama to learn whether
she is ready to marry or not.

399
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,212
- Is it?
- Yes.

400
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:45,145
Now did you understand that she is
not interested in getting married?

401
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,020
Now there's no use of
telling her to do so.

402
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,519
When she is ready, I will let
her know. She will agree.

403
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:54,182
That day like Prem Nazir and Sheela,

404
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:57,329
you and she will dance in
between these rubber trees.

405
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:58,752
Cheers.

406
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:07,330
Central.

407
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:29,376
Central.

408
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:43,036
“In this way.“ “My dear.“

409
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:51,231
“I will be a plant full of flowers
in your path.“

410
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,712
“I will be blossomed.“

411
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:59,058
“My dear.“

412
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:06,096
"“I will come and sit in the branch
of the jasmine plant.."

413
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:14,230
"in front of your house to touch you.“

414
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:22,429
“My dear, I have seen thousands
of your foot marks.."

415
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:28,744
"in the soil today.“"

416
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:36,944
“My dear.“

417
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:54,461
Central.

418
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:09,662
“The cloud has carried a milk pot..“

419
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:14,197
“..and has climbed the
steps of the mountains.“

420
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:21,268
“The valley will remain down there..“

421
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:26,936
“..while waving a hand for
the cold to come..“

422
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,843
“..by whispering sweet
nothings in the ear.“

423
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:32,814
“The drizzling rain will show
its naughtiness.“

424
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,750
“The feast is coming.“

425
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:38,322
“The silence is getting over.“

426
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:43,394
“In this way.“ “My dear.“

427
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:51,585
“I will be a plant full of flowers
in your path.“

428
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:58,003
“I will be blossomed.“

429
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:09,536
Central.

430
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:30,190
“From the wound of waste plant, too..“
“..the love will ooze out.“

431
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:39,582
“like this memory.“
“Green plants.“

432
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:45,053
“..are growing to climb on the top.“

433
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:50,922
"“The candle light will blossom
to satisfy the eyes."

434
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,364
"“The mark on the forehead will
shine like a letter full of love."

435
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,473
“My dear.“

436
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:09,663
“I will be a plant full of flowers
in your path.“

437
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:16,479
“I will be blossomed.“

438
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,918
“my dear“

439
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:25,664
"“I will come and sit on the
branch of a jasmine plant.."

440
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:33,854
"in front of your house to touch you.“

441
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:42,195
“My dear, I have seen thousands
of your foot marks.."

442
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:48,354
"in the soil today.“"

443
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:56,710
“My dear.“

444
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,131
- Mother.
- Yes.

445
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:08,363
Give water to that goat.

446
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,636
Don't shout. I will give it.

447
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,721
Hey, not like that.
Cosec2 minus cos2 is equal to 1.

448
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:29,729
She failed in 10th standard.
Then, too, she is brilliant.

449
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:33,432
She had failed because
of her intelligence.

450
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:37,529
"If she got 564 instead
of 164 marks" My God.

451
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,670
Then she wouldn't have
given me the peace of mind.

452
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,866
Study well.

453
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:45,374
Dinamma possesses the gold bangle which
she had brought for sister Elsamma.

454
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,513
I'm not interested in gold.

455
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,781
Some one is here who studied
for the bangles.

456
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:56,080
But she didn't get anything.
She studied too much.

457
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,022
- Sister.
- What?

458
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,353
The serial will start now.

459
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,088
- Where is the remote?
- Remote..

460
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:12,536
Hey, brilliant girl.
Give me the remote.

461
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,097
I won't give. I want to study.
I will give you one.

462
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,537
We can live because of your studies.

463
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,472
Give me.

464
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,872
- What's going on here?
- Sister.

465
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,575
Elsamma.

466
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,612
Elsamma.

467
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:32,646
Mother.

468
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,793
Who is that? You look.

469
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:37,019
What's the matter?

470
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:39,979
What's the matter, Brother Pillai?
Why did you come here at this time?

471
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:43,635
Paappan's son George called me.

472
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,736
His wife Saleena.

473
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,927
Saleena..

474
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:50,005
Saleena has passed away. Jesus.

475
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,804
She was hospitalized because
of her illness.

476
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,038
Did you inform Paappan?

477
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,810
I can't inform him.

478
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,416
You come with me as well.

479
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:17,426
Why are you late?
I didn't get the vehicle, that's why...

480
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:27,534
Take.

481
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:49,816
Central

482
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,490
George, when did you arrive?
Just now.

483
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,689
Mother.

484
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,665
How will she travel?

485
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,941
- Good morning.
- I don't need it.

486
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:10,742
I've been coming through this
route daily for giving you this.

487
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,611
I will also give you one.
With this broom.

488
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,549
“You are in my heart.“

489
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,019
“You are in front of my eyes.“

490
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:22,456
“Even when I close my eyes,
you are there, Sainaba.“

491
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:30,460
- Sweep. Sweep.
- Okay.

492
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:32,660
This singing is going to
get over, member.

493
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,771
What happened?
Are you threatening me?

494
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:36,305
You can think as you wish.

495
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:39,205
Let that bill get passed.
Which bill?

496
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,504
Woman's bill.

497
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:43,410
Then this village council will be
filled with women.

498
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,746
Then you call Delhi and tell them
to pass that bill soon.

499
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,081
Now only one woman member for
every three members.

500
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,289
If the bill gets passed, then 10 female
members equal to 10 male members.

501
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:56,056
Then this village council will become a
garden of beautiful female members.

502
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,164
I will fly here like a butterfly.

503
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,354
“Oh, Sainaba.“

504
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:04,368
“My butterfly.“
“my beautiful butterfly.“

505
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,036
“A butterfly who pollens the grains.“

506
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,060
“A butterfly who takes the
honey from the flowers.“

507
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:10,609
Woman's bill. Go away.

508
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,613
See, Elsamma. Is there a way to
teach this member a lesson?

509
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,606
Did you inform secretary Rajamma sir?

510
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:20,217
Oh, she is the Ramba of Remanan.
Dirty lady.

511
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:26,018
Secretary, you look beautiful
in this sari.

512
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:29,557
The entire village council will
reflect in your face.

513
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,924
- Go, man. Liar.
- Promise.

514
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,464
That nose. Those eyes.

515
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:38,431
“When our eyes meet..“
“When our eyes meet..“

516
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,969
"“When our.."

517
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:44,643
I've come in the morning itself to discuss
with you about tarring that road, Secretary.

518
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,574
Which road is being tarred?
We will tar the road which we like.

519
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:48,969
Go after taking the signature.

520
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:51,083
Elsamma's newspaper bill. Okay.

521
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:52,781
Are you tarring the road so that
we can walk on it?

522
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:53,679
No. So that we can sleep on it.

523
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:54,875
You go away.

524
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:01,555
“Five rhythms are not enough.“

525
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:05,452
- Teacher Mary.
- Yes.

526
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:09,124
The sand exports which Karippalli Sugunan
has started will destroy this village.

527
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:10,868
You know what will happen if
the mountains are demolished.

528
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,412
This village itself will be destroyed.

529
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:14,666
I have given the news in
today's newspaper.

530
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,240
You should discuss that
in the village council.

531
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:18,744
No use of discussing it.

532
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,007
Some people are living here
with Karipalli's money.

533
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,240
Teacher, you have mentioned
about me, right?

534
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:29,319
Karipalli Sugunan is my friend.
Hence, don't pass any statement like this.

535
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,822
I will complain to the village
council secretary if you pass.

536
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:38,293
Such statements about me who is serving
the people without even getting married.

537
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:39,931
To the person who is sitting inside.

538
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:42,431
Tarring over?

539
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:52,058
Central.

540
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,573
Me?

541
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,962
Why are you staring like that?
Now I'm sure.

542
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:16,226
What? That this is not a dream.

543
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:19,366
Liar. I love you.

544
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,072
Then why did you scream at me when
I said "good morning" in the morning?

545
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,566
I got angry because you
did all that publicly.

546
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,403
Write whatever you have in your mind
on a white paper and give it to me.

547
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,604
I Will do that.

548
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:33,341
You should give me an answer.
Sure.

549
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,185
- Tomorrow.
- Enough.

550
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:43,424
Elsamma, are you going
to start cattle farming?

551
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,495
No. This is for Unnikrishnan.

552
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:46,953
Give me a white paper, please.

553
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:49,124
What happened, member?

554
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:50,131
Are you writing news to get
it printed in the newspaper?

555
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:52,702
No. I'm going to write one request
to the chief minister.

556
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:55,214
To find a solution for water
shortage in Balan Pillai city.

557
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,212
You should go along with Thomachan
to see the bride the next Sunday.

558
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:05,217
I have told him that you will come.
I haven't told him.

559
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:07,276
You obey what I say.

560
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,886
Othenlvise you will see
another form of mine.

561
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,184
Calm down.

562
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,290
Everything will become alright. But I'm
not getting an opportunity to say it.

563
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,314
To whom?

564
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,059
Who? Elsamma?

565
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:23,463
Mother, how did you know that?
Open your eyes and see.

566
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:31,824
Central.

567
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,210
He's feeling shy.

568
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,307
Mother, tell her to go.

569
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,579
Mother, you take her that side.

570
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,951
Oh, there is no problem
if Elsamma sees you like this.

571
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,718
- You go away.
- Go, man.

572
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:49,454
What is today's dish?

573
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,130
Lentil curry or mix veg.
Lentil curry.

574
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,926
That's very easy to make.

575
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:56,760
Whatever it is, he will eat it.

576
00:37:56,991 --> 00:38:00,370
Then, too, you have to make
him something special“.

577
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,639
When he comes after bathing
the cattle and finishing other work.

578
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:05,667
Even I like all that.
But I'm unable to do it.

579
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:11,114
I'm telling him to get married
to eat something tasty.

580
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:13,012
He won't agree for that.

581
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,924
You move. I will do it.

582
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,458
Be careful. Careful.

583
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,793
Daughter, let's give an
advertisement in the newspaper.

584
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,196
That's good.
Nice photos will come as well.

585
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:31,535
You will get a horoscope, too.

586
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,095
But there is a small problem.
What?

587
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:34,871
We won't be able to know
whether the girl is..

588
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,342
"Handicapped, mad or has
ran away with someone or not."

589
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:39,010
Then no.

590
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,444
I haven't thought about all this.

591
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:43,415
Shardamma, give me one
glass buttermilk.

592
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,175
That's Thomachan.
He has come with proposals.

593
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,318
He is being stubborn about
conducting his marriage.

594
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:50,117
Fast - I'm coming.

595
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,023
Let me take buttermilk.

596
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:58,128
Who is this?

597
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,897
Anyway, it's nice to meet Elsamma here.

598
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,700
That Sibi from Thodupuzha
is calling me frequently.

599
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:06,132
He wants to come next
Sunday to see you.

600
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,964
Sister Mariamma hasn't
given any opinion.

601
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:10,603
I told her that I don't want it now.

602
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:15,236
He is a nice guy.
A nice jeep driver.

603
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,143
You should see him stand.

604
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,252
We can play 20-20 on his chest.

605
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,082
I need a little space for
'Kabaddi' alone.

606
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,680
When did you start playing 'Kabaddi'?

607
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:26,688
What's new? Is any proposal ready?

608
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:30,090
Sharadamma, there's a new suitor for Unni.
Okay.

609
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,524
Elappara Manju.

610
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:34,093
You read.

611
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,323
Take buttermilk.

612
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,363
Manju. 21 years old. 'Pooram' star.

613
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:41,921
I have checked if the stars match.

614
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:44,976
Eight out of ten match.
Then Saturday, Wednesday, Thursday...

615
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,407
All these are not harmful.
As in?

616
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,581
No bad effect of Saturn.

617
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,613
Venus is not in that area.

618
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,717
'Kuja' is in the 12th house.

619
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:55,648
Then about the bride.

620
00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:57,254
My Shardama.

621
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:01,120
She is more beautiful than the most
beautiful girl in Balan Pillai city.

622
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,453
Yes.

623
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,688
There's nothing to think about.

624
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:06,023
Mahalakshmi is coming to this house.

625
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:08,796
My Shardama.

626
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,663
We have to inform them that
we are coming there, right?

627
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,533
I have to catch two buses.
Then the auto charge.

628
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:16,366
If I get the traveling expenses.

629
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:17,872
Wait. Don't give the money now.

630
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:19,635
Who else is supposed to come? Give me.

631
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,478
Give me the bride's father's number.
Yes.

632
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,913
Let me call him.
What is the use of calling him?

633
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:25,577
The bride's father might have
gone to pluck pepper.- So?

634
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,980
What if he falls down and die while
taking the call when he is plucking pepper.

635
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,056
Tell her not to cancel
the marriage, Sharadamma.

636
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:38,329
Tell her. Don't cancel the marriage.
Lying?

637
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,659
Don't beat me up. I have epilepsy.

638
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,866
Jesus. This is his phone number.

639
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:49,004
He has just written about taking
money from you, Sharadamma.- Liar.

640
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,337
Anyway, it's good that you
have come here.

641
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,876
Take.

642
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,015
Keep that bottle here.

643
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,522
Paappan's son George has
enquired about you.

644
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,352
What did he inquire?

645
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,860
He asked me if you are
still living by foul play.

646
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:16,468
Don't laugh.
That's the part of social service.

647
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,361
I'm used to this from my childhood.
How will I change that?

648
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,435
- House repairing, right?
- Yes.

649
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,544
It's damaged.
We can't even sleep in there.

650
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,044
You please recommend the
village council for this.

651
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:38,384
What happened, Elsamma?
Are you coming for a strike?

652
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,992
It's better to change this name
to liquor shop instead of tea shop.

653
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:45,721
Member, please sign on this.
The bottle.

654
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,390
I haven't brought a bottle.
Then I will sign later.

655
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,570
Member, you put a signature
for him. This is our Unni.

656
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:55,568
Oh, if he is our Unni,
you keep him with you.

657
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,403
That means the member won't
sign, right?- I told you, right?

658
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,934
- Member.
- Yes?

659
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:04,574
Tomorrow morning, I will be in front of the
village council office along with my cattle.

660
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,343
For what? To defeat me by
putting dung there?

661
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,913
This member Remanan won't
get scared by seeing this.

662
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,250
I'm a lot bigger a snake than
what you think I am.

663
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,427
- You.
- Come here.

664
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,428
He came here to take
the signature for free.

665
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,194
The people taking the signature
will get Rs. 10000 or Rs. 20000.

666
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:24,801
The member who signs will
get only Rs. 1000 per month.

667
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:27,266
I can't even buy three full
bottles with that.

668
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,606
Even the village council and
government know that.- Yes.

669
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,769
Then all these will be there.
I will do that.

670
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:36,437
If I don't feed them, they will
cheat me. And I will lose my chair.

671
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,775
I need my chair.

672
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,851
For that, this signature lies only
with me. A bottle for signing.

673
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,384
- Keep it there.
- Take.

674
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:52,785
Where is Balan Pillai?

675
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,631
I'm not Balan Pillai.
He is hiding here.

676
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,894
- Where?
- Here.

677
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,029
Oh God!

678
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:05,836
Hey, open it. Hey, open it.

679
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:15,244
You won't open, right?
Will you open it or should I break in?

680
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,490
I have not drunk, sir.
I will do that.

681
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,590
Hey. Take him to the jeep.

682
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,894
Don't take me in the jeep, sir.
I have one city in my name.

683
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,426
I won't take you in the jeep.
Thank you.

684
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:29,396
I will take you walking.

685
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,831
Joseph, put those handcuffs
on his hand.

686
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:35,505
Take some sweet dish from
the shop. Take a banana, too.

687
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,569
The villagers will see me.

688
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,341
Sir, this has not ripened.
We will ripen it.

689
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,445
Don'tjump in front of them.

690
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:48,534
Central.

691
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,688
Did you see today's newspaper?

692
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,020
No. What is there in it?
Look at this.

693
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:57,921
Today, something will happen here.

694
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,361
Remanan won't become so
smart by saying bad words to you.

695
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,902
A bottle for the village council
member for signing.

696
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,019
Did you take the lock? Yes. Yes.

697
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,375
Now don't take it.

698
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:17,707
After closing the shop, you start abusing
Let that girl come to know about..

699
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:20,384
Member Remanan's strength.
Yes. Yes.

700
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,144
Remanan... Remanan.
Hey, come out.

701
00:44:22,343 --> 00:44:25,051
Don't lock it. Balan Pillai is telling you.
Elsamma is our child.

702
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,223
Did the police arrest you
because she is our child?

703
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,207
You have done illegal things in my shop,
that's why the police arrested me.

704
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,230
She has got me out.
You go and make tea.

705
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,230
If member Remanan decides
something it surely happens.

706
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,063
Even then, my Remanan..
Hey. Keep quiet.

707
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:38,496
No use of shouting like this
by saying, "Mana, mana".

708
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:41,571
She will dig a hole in the place
where she sits. Hey. Come out.

709
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,575
Come like that.

710
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,402
One minute.

711
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,839
Member, you please come inside.

712
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,244
If you are calling me for
a compromise, I won't come.

713
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,013
Not for that.
To close the account of the rent.

714
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:52,847
I will close the account.
That's right. Member, you go there.

715
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,588
I'm going only because
you told me to.

716
00:45:00,514 --> 00:45:02,016
My dear Sainaba.

717
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,593
My dear.

718
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:04,784
My pearl.

719
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,263
When I see you going fonivard by
sweeping the village council office..

720
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,594
My heart starts beating faster.

721
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,438
Is this called love, my dear?

722
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,999
My heart beat doesn't become
normal even after drinking a lot.

723
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:21,202
For it to normalize,
you should kiss my body.

724
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:23,382
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. And you.

725
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,776
Enough. Enough. Enough.

726
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,843
Should I publish this in the
newspaper or distribute a notice?

727
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,015
Is it my handwriting?

728
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,118
- What?
- Who knows?

729
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,625
- Did you eat that?
- Yes.

730
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:45,233
No problem.
I possess 100 copies of this.

731
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:47,133
There's one in the bank locker, too.

732
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:50,139
Daughter, don't trap me.

733
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:53,972
Read this book, too.
Woman and law.

734
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:58,146
Talk in a bad style.
Look in a bad manner.

735
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,147
All this comes under
sexual harassment.

736
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:07,152
Indian Penal Code 294, 509, 298.
Only this much.

737
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,485
No. There's some more.

738
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,992
Sainaba is ready to file
the complaint at the station.

739
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:13,005
If you want, you can close
the shop as well.

740
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,929
No. Take this.

741
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:21,903
Sign on this form, too.

742
00:46:22,095 --> 00:46:26,771
This is the request of Palunni
to do cattle farming.

743
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:29,846
It's wrong to ask for a bottle
for all this, right?- Yes.

744
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,186
When the CM calls you,
you tell him that.

745
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,020
Remanan signed when you
showed the paper. May I go?

746
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,524
What happened? Not locking it up?
Locking it up? No.

747
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,356
She showed the fax which
came from the CM's office..

748
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,197
"Saying that I shouldn't make
Elsamma vacate the place."

749
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,531
Wherever the CM sees me,
he calls me Remanan.

750
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,966
And talks to me like a friend.
Then how will I not obey him?

751
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,366
That's true.
She has a good hold.

752
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,706
Let's go. Go... go...

753
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:02,642
Even then, what exactly happened there?
Elsamma. Very nice.

754
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:05,279
Yes. I was thinking about you.

755
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,160
Yes. I already spoke to you.
But then, you know..

756
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,649
I will call you back.

757
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,731
Hi, Elsamma. I'm Aby.
Did you recognize me?

758
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,400
Oh, yes. Paappan called me.

759
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:24,489
That's why there's such
a load in the vehicle.

760
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:27,229
Earlier, when I came here,
Elsamma was in the 8th standard.

761
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:31,398
I couldn't recollect your face.
How will girls change like this?

762
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:35,740
Yes. My mother used to say
that girls grow up very fast.

763
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:38,742
That's true. I have studied
in really cool colleges.

764
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,910
If the girls there had see Elsamma
they would've gone green with envy.

765
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,090
Don't flatter me.
Let me live somehow.

766
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:47,916
How is your business going on?
Did the recession affect it?

767
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,817
What recession?

768
00:47:50,017 --> 00:47:53,328
Every month there are 5-6 marriages
and a few deaths.

769
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,365
I get Rs.100 for the advertisement
of someone's death.

770
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:58,131
For wedding advertisement,
I get 15% as commission.

771
00:47:58,325 --> 00:48:00,362
Then making rubber sheets.
Selling newspapers.

772
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:01,596
I'm managing everything.

773
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:07,377
That's why Paappan told me
that Elsamma is a lion, boy, etc.

774
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,377
Not only Paappan, villagers are
also saying that about me.

775
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:14,279
But I won't like anyone calling me boy.

776
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,613
Why so? Don't you like boys?

777
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:21,448
I like them. But most of
them are boring.

778
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:27,496
If they see some girl, they will smile.
Then they will start flattering them.

779
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:32,898
By seeing such sweetness, I feel
like giving them one tight slap.

780
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,331
I'm not talking about Aby.
Thank you.

781
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,904
She is here.

782
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:49,649
I and your mother are eating something
because of her and her sisters.

783
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,823
I'm not well, my son.

784
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,991
Jesus knows that very well.
That's why you got the name Dinamma.

785
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,491
Mother has a disease.

786
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,827
- How are you, Elsamma?
- Fine.

787
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:03,869
Did you give them something to drink?

788
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,662
Your mother is not here for that.

789
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,605
She has gone out in the
morning with the bible.

790
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,573
Give me that.

791
00:49:12,966 --> 00:49:15,674
Aby and Sherine are not going.
Is it?

792
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,249
George has come here to
leave them here.- Okay.

793
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,849
He is planning to sell
his flat in Eranakulam.

794
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,113
Shortly, he will come back from Dubai.

795
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:28,190
Oh, now your son and
son's children are here.

796
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,462
You are happy, right?
Dinamma is also happy.

797
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:39,028
God might have thought that we will
die seeing everyone in the last stage.

798
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:44,038
That's luck. God's grace.

799
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:52,564
Central.

800
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:55,209
Elsamma, don't feel bad.

801
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:58,721
It's my weakness that
I become friendly very fast.

802
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,825
I'm seeing Elsamma after a long time.

803
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,063
But I don't feel there was a time gap.

804
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,732
That's why I talked to you like that.

805
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,400
I felt so that time itself.

806
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:17,073
You are Palunni, right?
No. Unnikrishnan.

807
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,801
Paappan told me.
I recognized you at first sight itself.

808
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:22,904
Now you carry on.
The keys are there in the bike.- Okay.

809
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,855
Palunni and Elsamam are
good friends, right?

810
00:50:34,214 --> 00:50:38,094
Yes. What's the matter?
I liked Elsamma.

811
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:42,029
Looking after a family in this age.
Unbelievable.

812
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,096
I haven't even earned
10 paise in my life.

813
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,853
I enjoyed my life with
my daddy's money.

814
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:50,338
I just can't believe the
essence of women, you know.

815
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,268
I was really excited to know about it.

816
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,774
I'm really happy to see her.

817
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,542
Palunni. I want to know
more about her.- Okay.

818
00:50:56,737 --> 00:50:57,817
- You would tell me.
- Okay.

819
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,349
Okay? <i>'</i> May I 90? Bye_

820
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:03,620
- okay. Bye-
- Okay.

821
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,458
Who knows?
I'm not going to stay here.

822
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:10,353
I got bored right when I got here.

823
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:13,289
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Don't cut. Don't cut.

824
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:14,957
Where are you?

825
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:19,459
I really miss you, dear.
Seriously.

826
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,827
Why?

827
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,568
Just hold a second.

828
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:26,471
What is this?

829
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:27,977
Can't you come inside
after knocking the door?

830
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,639
You don't have any manners.

831
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:36,916
That.. Sherine, I'm not used
to all that. Sorry.

832
00:51:37,377 --> 00:51:38,913
Keep that tea there and go.

833
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:44,091
Close that door, too.

834
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,397
- Paapppan.
- Yes.

835
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,334
What English he speaks!

836
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,010
I have escaped from there somehow.

837
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,078
He is Paappan's grandson.
He has to show that dignity, right?

838
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:07,685
Engineers have a good salary.
What is this big salary?

839
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,279
It might be around Rs. 25000.

840
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:12,855
I can easily make that
from cattle farming.

841
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:18,858
Then English. I don't need to speak
to the cows in English, right?- Is it?

842
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:27,862
You ask her about that matter.

843
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,107
Your granddaughter is shining there.
Am I the servant of this house?

844
00:52:32,632 --> 00:52:35,374
I felt irritated.
What did she say?

845
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,209
What is the use of saying anything?
I know what to do.

846
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,883
If she says something again,
she will have to starve. That's all.

847
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,614
Is she that audacious?

848
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:44,551
What if I am?

849
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,054
If you want, I will interfere.

850
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,227
You have one more peg
and stay happy.

851
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,623
He is asking in a manner as
if he will do something.

852
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:53,485
Paappan.

853
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,659
She says that she wants
chicken in the night.

854
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:59,064
If you bring it, I will cook it.
Othenlvise I won't.

855
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,570
That.. Don't go away like this.

856
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:04,831
I want to tell you something.
Seriously.

857
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:07,568
If it is serious, then you consult
some veterinary doctor.

858
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:12,483
For you, it would be a joke.

859
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,920
At last, I have to see
someone else marrying her.

860
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,146
- Who is that?
- That..

861
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,784
Have some water.

862
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,788
Enough!

863
00:53:31,024 --> 00:53:33,937
My Jesus, this change in Dinamma.

864
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,601
She used to sleep at 7pm
without eating supper.

865
00:53:38,064 --> 00:53:39,600
Now see how she is sitting.

866
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:42,206
Now I'm alright.

867
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:43,946
- Paappan.
- Yes.

868
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:48,881
Let's change her name from
Dinamma to Santhoshamma.

869
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,121
Go away.

870
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,621
At least we will be happy to
call out that name.- Yes.

871
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,621
Chicken... Chiken.
Is it Elsamma's special?

872
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,956
Whatever she makes is special.

873
00:54:00,553 --> 00:54:02,965
What time in the morning
do you have to go?- 4 am.

874
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,467
Aren't you scared to go at that time?

875
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,970
If I'm scared, I can't live.

876
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,633
What Paappan said is true.
Let me give her the chicken.

877
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:16,404
Enough. Enough.

878
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:18,981
Don't say that.
You have to eat nicely.

879
00:54:19,806 --> 00:54:21,012
Hey. Enough.

880
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,490
What happened to her?
She doesn't like spicy food.

881
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,256
I didn't know that.
Paappan likes spicy food.

882
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,225
Are you making it for Paappan alone?

883
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:34,330
You should have told me.

884
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,668
You should ask that before making it.

885
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,834
Daughter, you have food.
I don't want it.

886
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,858
Daughter.

887
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,234
You eat... I'm coming.

888
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,513
Put off the stove when the
water gets boiled.

889
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,452
You don't take it seriously.
She has her mother's nature.

890
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,857
She doesn't worry about
other's feelings.

891
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,469
For me, you are important
than anyone else.

892
00:55:13,994 --> 00:55:19,137
You go home. Maria will wash
the plates. Go.

893
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,880
A nice smell of chicken curry.

894
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,216
Are you a dog to get the smell?

895
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,892
He came to get the smell.

896
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:51,256
Central.

897
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:01,348
To sign the progress card.

898
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:08,793
How many subjects have
you failed in?- Three.

899
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:16,425
Sister. Don't beat me up.

900
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,603
Sister Esla. No.

901
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,329
Don't beat me up.
Don't beat her up, Sister Elsa.

902
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,433
What do you lack here?

903
00:56:24,397 --> 00:56:27,776
If you fail, so do I.
I don't want to see you.

904
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,948
You go to school in the
morning to study.

905
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,552
What is the use of that?

906
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:39,285
What is the price of gold now?

907
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,391
I thought that at least she will study and
get that bangle from Dinamma's hand.

908
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:44,793
That hope is also lost. Go away.

909
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,797
This beating is not enough for you.

910
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,461
She is very smart in beating me up.

911
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,018
But she should have shown this smartness
while she was studying in the 10th standard.

912
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:58,642
Let her pass the 10th standard first.
She came to beat me up.

913
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:24,162
I'm waiting here for half an hour.

914
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,894
My today's timing is changed.
Why are you late today?

915
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:31,272
What happened?
Not well? Your face looks weak.

916
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:35,744
Whatever it is, you tell me.
Anyway, you have a problem.

917
00:57:36,736 --> 00:57:39,342
We don't share all the
problems, Palunni.

918
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:41,709
We should keep some
in our heart itself.

919
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:44,353
Then only we will get the
strength to live.

920
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:00,603
Look. Sister Elsa is coming.

921
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:03,964
Jesus. Where is the broom?

922
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,374
Jesus.

923
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:14,576
In my hope, with time on hands...

924
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:16,044
Elsamma. Good morning.

925
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:21,813
Elsamma.

926
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,887
Change my darkness to
thy light and my...

927
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,258
Treesa.

928
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,834
I will get tired by sweeping
for 10 minutes.

929
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,267
Please show me the place
where you swept.

930
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,243
I will show you.

931
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:46,417
Did your father come and sweep
this entire place?- May be.

932
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,684
Then let him come and sweep
the rest of the place, too.

933
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:49,345
Chicken.

934
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:51,647
Some smell might come from
the neighbor's kitchen.

935
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,925
If you smell that and come..

936
00:58:56,683 --> 00:58:58,594
I'm going to the church.

937
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,785
I thought about that when
I saw the chicken.- What?

938
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,832
Mother, you will go somewhere
to avoid cooking the chicken.

939
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:08,199
Don't speak nonsense.
You came after failing the exams.

940
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:10,667
Mother has come back
after sweeping.

941
00:59:11,097 --> 00:59:12,667
You're sweating so much!

942
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:16,603
Is Elsamma here?

943
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:19,945
Elsamma. Son Aby is calling you.

944
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,646
Aby? Son? I'm coming.

945
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,953
I'm not seeing you people there.

946
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:30,285
If you don't come there,
I and Sherine will get bored.

947
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,958
I have a lot to study.

948
00:59:36,456 --> 00:59:38,458
You study.
Your sisters can come, right?

949
00:59:38,925 --> 00:59:42,202
If you don't come there, I will come
here when I get bored.

950
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:43,465
Treesa, did you hear that?

951
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,143
She is shy to come there
after you people did.

952
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,140
For what?

953
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,643
She is black in color,
that's why she became black.

954
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:55,548
I had high blood pressure
when I was to deliver her.

955
00:59:55,742 --> 00:59:57,380
Treesa is beautiful.

956
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,489
Hollywood heroines
Halle Barry, Janet Jackson...

957
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,320
They all are black in color.
How many fans do they have?

958
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,497
How many boyfriends do they have?
Black beauty.

959
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,865
Right, Leena? White as well.

960
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,696
Just smiling.

961
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:17,164
She is like that.
She knows only to study.

962
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,503
Elsamma's wish is to make
her a teacher.- Is it?

963
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,510
To become a teacher,
you need a doctorate in talking.

964
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,903
Accompany me. I'm the best person
to train you for that.

965
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:27,676
I will change you, Leena.

966
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,951
Wow. What a change, buddy?

967
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,518
I was waiting to have tea made by you.

968
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,359
That time you went for
throwing newspapers.

969
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,193
Elsamma, you come.
Paappan has sent me to bring Elsamma.

970
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,832
Oh, then she wants to scream at me
by saying that tea is not strong,

971
01:00:43,856 --> 01:00:47,827
there's no sugar in the coffee, etc.
I don't need to do all that.

972
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,804
Don't think like that.
That's not because I'm angry on Elsamma.

973
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:53,918
She is disappointed because
of leaving Ernakulam.

974
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:56,708
That's why she is doing all this.
Now everything is okay.

975
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,781
Elsamma, you come.
Othenlvise Paappan will come here.

976
01:00:58,805 --> 01:01:01,547
- Go, Daughter.
- Let's go.

977
01:01:05,678 --> 01:01:08,557
Have you designed this shirt and
loincloth yourself? Very innovative.

978
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,225
This is my father's shirt and loincloth.

979
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,049
When I wear this, I feel that my father
is with me. That's my strength.

980
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:16,565
This dress is suited for you.
A lot of boys come after you, right?

981
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:22,206
Yes. It's the right of boys to go
after beautiful girls, right?

982
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,409
Yes. Mine, too.- But they will just
keep running. No use.

983
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,598
Why so?

984
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,245
They fear getting slapped.
Then they will get one.

985
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:29,970
Who?

986
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:32,081
My friends are coming from
Ernakulam with my bike.

987
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,465
They will go after Christmas only.

988
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:41,051
My God. She would say that I look
like Mohanlal in the movie 'Spadikam'.

989
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,497
Aby, why are you laughing?

990
01:01:52,692 --> 01:01:54,812
When I saw Elsamma laughing
to just give you company..

991
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,599
Then you go, Aby. I will come.

992
01:01:58,264 --> 01:02:00,609
“L have waited for you several times
in the college campus.“

993
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,613
I also possess a trouser
which he wore.

994
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,840
But I wear that only when
I bathe cows.- Is it?

995
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:12,112
Palunni. Mannunni.
During which festival did you buy this?

996
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,365
I haven't bought this during a festival.
I bought it from Kattappana.

997
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,461
I will tell you when you
grow your moustache.

998
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,791
Anyway, you look glamorous.

999
01:02:22,221 --> 01:02:23,221
- May I go?
- Okay.

1000
01:02:28,394 --> 01:02:31,136
- Elsamma.
- Yes.

1001
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,841
Are you in need of money?

1002
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,074
When I saw your face in the morning,
I felt that you are in need of money.

1003
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,011
If you need some, then let me know.

1004
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,248
Unni's money is your money, too.

1005
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:50,719
What? Unni. Lfl need money,
I will ask you for it. You go.

1006
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,988
I have to make tea for Abymon.
Abymon?

1007
01:02:55,188 --> 01:03:01,503
Yes. I call the boys of rich family
"Abymon". And I will call you Palunni.

1008
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,865
Abymon's friends are coming.
Friends?

1009
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:09,244
Yes. Friends. I will have a lot of work.

1010
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:21,706
Central.

1011
01:03:31,324 --> 01:03:32,324
Hello.

1012
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:35,366
Hey. We've reached.

1013
01:03:40,766 --> 01:03:44,236
“A play ground for playing and
a pond for bathing for us.“

1014
01:03:44,437 --> 01:03:47,577
“Come with us like birds.“
“Come with us.“

1015
01:03:47,773 --> 01:03:50,754
“Elsamma.“ - “My sweetheart.“

1016
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:54,254
“When the wind swings the leaves..“
“..let's fall on the flower bed.“

1017
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:59,419
“Let's fill the leaves with fog as stars.“
Hey, go inside.

1018
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:00,927
“Welcoming with love.“

1019
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,600
“Hey. If you show your hand,
I will give a handful..“

1020
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:09,171
“..of sweet grapes and the
village is calling us.“

1021
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:15,774
- Hey, come.
- Drink.

1022
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:24,269
Central.

1023
01:04:27,346 --> 01:04:30,793
“The new sand has good fragrance.“

1024
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:34,192
“The smell which the rains have given.“

1025
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:41,133
“Without seeing anyone.“
“Without going anywhere.“

1026
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:44,974
“This valley..“ - Come here.

1027
01:04:45,164 --> 01:04:48,475
“The new sand has good fragrance.“

1028
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:51,877
“The smell which the rains have given.“

1029
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:58,881
“Without seeing anyone.“
“Without going anywhere.“

1030
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:01,916
“This valley...“

1031
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:06,156
“Like a virgin.“

1032
01:05:07,787 --> 01:05:11,166
“The beautiful stones, gold and silver.“

1033
01:05:11,357 --> 01:05:14,497
“Even iron and bronze will shine.“

1034
01:05:14,694 --> 01:05:22,340
“A word with answers like these.“
“Own people stay strong.“

1035
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:31,853
“This is the flower garden which I kept.“
Hey, Palunni.

1036
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:34,684
“The field which was waiting to harvest.“
Okay, Palunni. Bye.

1037
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:40,027
“Even in each of the buds..“
“Even in each of the bulbs.“

1038
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:43,358
“Come, friends.“

1039
01:05:43,889 --> 01:05:47,359
“This is the flower garden which I kept.“

1040
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:55,206
“The field which was waiting to harvest.“
“Even in each of the buds.“

1041
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:56,401
Pappan.

1042
01:05:56,569 --> 01:06:01,040
“Even in each of the bulbs.“
“Come, friends.“

1043
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,710
“The place is very beautiful.“

1044
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:08,380
“A play ground for playing and
a pond for bathing for us.“

1045
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:11,892
“Come with us like birds.“
“Come with us.“

1046
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:15,554
“My sweet heart.“
“When the wind swings the leaves..“

1047
01:06:15,755 --> 01:06:18,395
“..let's fall on the flower bed.“

1048
01:06:18,591 --> 01:06:24,735
“Let's fill the leaves with fog as stars.“
“Welcoming with love.“

1049
01:06:25,264 --> 01:06:27,642
“Hey. If you show your hand,
I will give a handful of..“

1050
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:33,511
“..sweet grapes and the village
is calling us.“

1051
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:51,916
Central.

1052
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:26,259
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Hold my hands

1053
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:31,438
I'm seeing you after a long time.
Did you recognize me?

1054
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:35,203
What kind of a question are you asking?
I recognized you.

1055
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:38,280
You are Kizhakkevattathu
Mathan's daughter Jenny, right?

1056
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,677
Where are you now?

1057
01:07:39,872 --> 01:07:42,512
After the 10th standard exams,
my father was transferred from here.

1058
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:46,111
I studied my +1 and +2 in Chennai.
Now studying for medicine in Bangalore.

1059
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:48,616
Father got transferred to that place.

1060
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,962
Grandfather told us to come
here for Christmas.

1061
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,805
- That's why we came here.
- Okay.

1062
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:56,965
I didn't come to know about you
because I don't have your phone number.

1063
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,156
Tell me.

1064
01:07:58,424 --> 01:07:59,960
Medicine or engineering?

1065
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,065
Which college did you join?

1066
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:07,335
What happened to her?

1067
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:09,910
- Elsa.
- Let her go.

1068
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:12,648
If we talk about her studies,
she will be disappointed.

1069
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:13,838
For what?

1070
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,652
That.. I will tell you.

1071
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,719
She didn't continue her studies after
getting failed in the 10th standard.

1072
01:08:17,743 --> 01:08:20,314
- Failed? Elsa?
- Yes.

1073
01:08:20,746 --> 01:08:24,319
Who told you this nonsense?
She had got distinction.

1074
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:31,160
Our register number was nearby.

1075
01:08:32,558 --> 01:08:35,232
- Is it true, Daughter?
- Yes.

1076
01:08:44,303 --> 01:08:47,341
I didn't have any other option in
front of me when my father expired.

1077
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:51,516
If I had gone for studying after getting
a distinction they would have suffered.

1078
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:58,585
If I go to complete my studies, then I
can't send these three children to study.

1079
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,688
That's why I stopped
my studies temporarily.

1080
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:22,043
You are the luckiest sister
in the world.

1081
01:09:38,023 --> 01:09:46,023
<i>Sister . . Sister...</i>

1082
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:12,116
Central.

1083
01:10:25,404 --> 01:10:26,474
Smile, please.

1084
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,139
Congrats.

1085
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,618
Today is my party.

1086
01:10:39,418 --> 01:10:41,955
Oh, coming after getting the good news.

1087
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,464
Elsamma is a boy. A boy.

1088
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,297
Oh, then you fix a moustache for her.
Yes. We will give that.

1089
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,301
- Omana.
- Yes.

1090
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,135
You should give her a party.

1091
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,910
I will pass this in this week's committee.
It will be passed in the next week.

1092
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:56,470
We should celebrate this.

1093
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:01,483
Daughter. I forgot to inform you
about an important matter.

1094
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:06,316
You have got distinction, so keep
company with qualified people.

1095
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,493
Don't stay friends with people
who failed in 10th standard.

1096
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,322
In between, you are playing
against me. Go. Go.

1097
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,832
Brother Pillai is very happy.
He has brought tea and snacks for free.

1098
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:19,502
LS it?

1099
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,672
Look at this. Dinamma has
given this bangle.

1100
01:11:26,432 --> 01:11:28,776
I have got only this.

1101
01:11:32,471 --> 01:11:34,178
Elsamma. Don't go.

1102
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:38,844
That's why I was saying that don't lie
to the marriage broker and God.

1103
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:41,284
You should have told me earlier
that you got distinction.

1104
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,360
Lots of boys are ready to marry you.

1105
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:46,928
Do you want a doctor? An engineer?
Germany. France. Italy. Tell me.

1106
01:11:47,286 --> 01:11:49,459
I will tell you.
There's a lot of time for that.

1107
01:11:49,655 --> 01:11:52,033
Next Sunday, I will come
with a doctor. Okay.

1108
01:11:52,825 --> 01:11:55,203
Hey. Please come. You calm down.

1109
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:59,865
You will only get a girl who
failed in the 10th standard.

1110
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,232
- Keep this.
- For what?

1111
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,372
Don't bringing a proposal for me.

1112
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,776
That's good. As it is,
it's difficult to find one.

1113
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:07,625
- Keep this, too.
- For what?

1114
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,720
Don't bring any proposal for Elsamma.

1115
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:11,553
Things have reached this level, right?
Yes.

1116
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,386
You can't decide this alone.

1117
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,223
I'm the best broker of
this village council.

1118
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:18,387
I have to get the commission. Go.
Okay.

1119
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,984
Leave that.
Hey, take the vehicle.

1120
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:24,227
I won't go like that. I need 100% commission.
- Okay.

1121
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:34,236
- Move.
- Hey.

1122
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,410
It is boiling on the stove.

1123
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,917
There is something wrong in this.

1124
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,645
I'll tell you that. Come.

1125
01:12:45,878 --> 01:12:47,915
Hey, Jose. Did you rob this
from somewhere?

1126
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,753
Yes. But I got it from the house.
Very nice.

1127
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,723
I won't give you cash. I will give you
only liquor.- That's enough.

1128
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,424
Okay. Oh my God!

1129
01:12:55,721 --> 01:12:58,429
Jaggery for the hangover.
Something else for the taste.

1130
01:12:58,657 --> 01:13:02,104
If there's chicken to eat, then..

1131
01:13:02,361 --> 01:13:04,102
Very nice. Write in my account.

1132
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:09,268
“By seeing her cheeks or
by seeing her eyes.“

1133
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:14,611
“I have fallen in love.“
“I don't know “

1134
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:18,118
“Malankuravan of Ezhimalakad.“
He is the Excise Circle Inspector here.

1135
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,120
Now in suspension.
He is an old mimicry artist.

1136
01:13:21,413 --> 01:13:26,294
If the circle inspector dances here after
drinking, will the excise come here?

1137
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,295
No. Elsamma is planning
things with me.

1138
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,627
She said that she will lock
my liquor shop. Nothing.

1139
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:36,136
Let's take rest now.
“In the yard.“

1140
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:38,298
- Sir.
- Yes.

1141
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,306
This is Ernakulam team. Aby.

1142
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:40,977
- Hello.
- Sherry.

1143
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,166
- Hello.
- Benny.

1144
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:42,812
Hari.

1145
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:47,973
Okay. I can drink another bottle of liquor
without touching it, in your presence.

1146
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:51,154
The formant of sending
SMS for me is IS Soman.

1147
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:54,984
S-O-M-A-N. Want to see Mohanlal.

1148
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,163
Now Suresh Gopi.

1149
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,328
The member is sitting inside.

1150
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:06,492
Because of that Elsamma,
he has been doing his business here.

1151
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,339
- How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

1152
01:14:11,296 --> 01:14:16,336
Don't talk about that Elsamma here.
I get irritated on hearing her name.

1153
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:19,675
I should talk. I have invited these
people to talk about her.

1154
01:14:19,972 --> 01:14:23,613
She should stop focusing on me.
You can do that.

1155
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,079
What do we have to do?
Karipalli, you tell me.

1156
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:32,761
There are four dynamites in Elsamma's
house. You are four match sticks.

1157
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:38,967
With the fire and its fumes,
her social service will get over.

1158
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,868
In English.
You should molest at least one.

1159
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,200
Yes.- He has brought us here by
telling us about those four girls.

1160
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:50,710
At least I will get one.
I will take that.

1161
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:56,783
Then Elsamma. He has
an eye on her.- Yes.

1162
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:03,056
Naughty boys. You have already
started your work, right? Very nice.

1163
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,720
You drink.

1164
01:15:09,354 --> 01:15:12,301
What a girl she is!
She is like fresh sugarcane.

1165
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,902
Frankly speaking, I love her.
I'd love to eat her.

1166
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:18,404
- Is it?
- Love.

1167
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,907
She doesn't even know what love is.

1168
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:28,411
She is the devil who drinks
the blood of lovers.

1169
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,412
She is against love.

1170
01:15:38,684 --> 01:15:40,357
Don't be naughty to me.

1171
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:48,431
No. Listen to me.

1172
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,801
I will get angry.

1173
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:00,940
Afraid of me.

1174
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,208
Leena.

1175
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:05,455
Hey.

1176
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:06,978
- What?
- Look at her

1177
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:11,048
Suresh.

1178
01:16:11,883 --> 01:16:13,055
Suresh?

1179
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,633
I won't talk.

1180
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:42,506
Central.

1181
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:06,107
You are so cute, buddy.
Okay. Okay.

1182
01:17:06,305 --> 01:17:10,344
Hello. Palunni.
You haven't treated us well.

1183
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:13,269
You are not showing any love for us
after coming to your village.

1184
01:17:13,312 --> 01:17:18,125
Oh, yes. There's time, right?
Hey. What happened?

1185
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,124
Palunni. Sorry.

1186
01:17:23,322 --> 01:17:24,699
Why did you tell me that you
want to see me urgently?

1187
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:25,723
Come. I will tell you.

1188
01:17:28,327 --> 01:17:30,087
Don't feel bad on hearing
what I have to say.

1189
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:33,038
I have a doubt about Elsamma.
What?

1190
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,036
Elsamma has a love affair.

1191
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:39,705
That.. What is the use of
knowing about that?- Yes.

1192
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:43,318
I love her a lot. Lfl come to know that
someone stands between us, then..

1193
01:17:43,508 --> 01:17:44,043
Then?

1194
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:47,815
I can handle him, later I can talk to her.
Is there someone? Tell me.

1195
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:48,558
No.

1196
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:49,885
- Sure?
- What?

1197
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,891
- Sure?
- Yes. Sure.

1198
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:04,072
My Jesus. What am I hearing?
Unni, what did you say?

1199
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,806
I said that there's no one.
But there is someone.

1200
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:10,978
- What?
- Love.

1201
01:18:11,169 --> 01:18:12,739
Love? For whom?

1202
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:16,184
That we will tell you tomorrow morning
along with the proof.

1203
01:18:16,842 --> 01:18:18,116
Don't lie.

1204
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:21,853
After speaking this nonsense and
if Elsamma comes to know about it..

1205
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:26,257
Oh, an angel. Liar.
Let the sun rise tomorrow.

1206
01:18:26,718 --> 01:18:32,760
Yesterday, I told her that Jerry is smart
and she screamed at me. Devil.

1207
01:18:34,426 --> 01:18:37,930
Tonight we will catch her red handed.
Tonight.

1208
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,041
The Walkman is ready.

1209
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:41,465
Who is that?

1210
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,950
Why have you come here now?
Take that stick.

1211
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:53,122
I'm fed up of telling you not
to sleep during day time.

1212
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:56,216
My Jesus. I don't know why
I would sleep wherever I sit.

1213
01:18:56,715 --> 01:18:58,456
Is that a disease, Unni?

1214
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:05,796
Not a disease. Arrogance.
You sleep to avoid cooking.

1215
01:19:06,725 --> 01:19:09,797
- What happened to you?
- That..

1216
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:16,071
I will tell you. I will tell you. Aby has
told Unni that you have an affair.

1217
01:19:16,935 --> 01:19:20,314
Is it? I can't believe.
What did you say?

1218
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:22,309
I haven't said anything.

1219
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:29,315
She got 'I section'..
Mother. Distinction.

1220
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:36,830
Whatever it is. At that time itself I decided
that I will get her married to an educated boy.

1221
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,162
Aby is smart.
Hey, he is well educated.

1222
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:44,039
Let Elsa decide whom she wants
to marry. Right, Unni?

1223
01:19:53,772 --> 01:19:56,514
What happened to you?
Restlessness?

1224
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:00,190
Usually, you will are tense when
the cow's delivery is due.

1225
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,413
Now this...

1226
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,225
When I failed in the 10th standard...
Keep quiet.

1227
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:10,190
You had shouted if we sent you for studying,
you will die byjumping in the dung hole.

1228
01:20:10,655 --> 01:20:13,693
Children will say something like that.
But you should force them.

1229
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,369
You should forcefully
send them to study.

1230
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:17,393
How will that happen?
You can save one year's fees.

1231
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:22,443
I will give you one slap.
- I don't want rice or anything else. You eat.

1232
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:28,714
No need to pass 10th standard for telling a girl
that you love her and you want to marry her.

1233
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:52,756
Central.

1234
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,024
From where did you get this?
My class mate.

1235
01:21:09,714 --> 01:21:13,423
I told you not to record all this.
We can ask sister directly.

1236
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:14,785
What?

1237
01:21:15,387 --> 01:21:18,095
That... last night. Last night?

1238
01:21:19,024 --> 01:21:21,937
- Who is Suresh?
- Suresh?

1239
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:25,838
Yes. You ask Suresh..
I should ask Suresh?

1240
01:21:26,331 --> 01:21:28,937
We heard you asking for a kiss.

1241
01:21:29,234 --> 01:21:31,510
Nonsense. Don't you get sleep?

1242
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,049
Don't tell anyone.

1243
01:21:36,575 --> 01:21:40,682
Tell us at least.
If we do something...

1244
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:44,150
I will inform you. Now I can't keep
this a secret, right?

1245
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:47,795
You should not only inform us,
but also show him to us.

1246
01:21:48,887 --> 01:21:52,801
Is it enough after distributing
the papers in the morning?- Yes.

1247
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:55,638
Then, my sisters, you go and sleep.

1248
01:22:09,908 --> 01:22:13,981
I know only one Suresh.
Pushpankandath Vasudevan sir's son.

1249
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,490
Jesus. He?
Should I call him "brother"?

1250
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:20,322
Why?
I used to call him dog earlier.

1251
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:21,223
For what?

1252
01:22:21,419 --> 01:22:23,331
He has shown some excitement
whenever he sees me.

1253
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,163
On seeing you?

1254
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:28,498
Yes. Is it not possible?
I have lots of fans. I haven't told you.

1255
01:22:31,596 --> 01:22:34,167
Where are you going like this?
I will tell you that later.

1256
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,006
Now you go and give
some grass to the cow.

1257
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,511
We are going to sister's lover.
Is it?

1258
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:41,263
Yesterday, I told you, didn't I?
We are going to see that person.

1259
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:49,355
Elsamma. They won't listen
if I call them urgently.

1260
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:52,460
A person from Rajakkad having a job
in the gulf is waiting in the city.

1261
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:57,691
He is ready to marry without dowry.
Should I show Elsamma to him?

1262
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,028
If you don't wish, then give me Rs.1000.
Show him.

1263
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:02,036
Then give me the money
which I have given you.

1264
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,370
- That..
- Give me my money.

1265
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:07,270
Don't say that. I just lied.
Today there is a curfew in the city.

1266
01:23:07,465 --> 01:23:10,207
She has a new affair.
She is going to show him.

1267
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:13,315
- Jesus. My 3%.
- What?

1268
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:15,712
- My 3% is gone.
- Your percent.

1269
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:23,324
I will not leave you.

1270
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,228
My 3%.

1271
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:32,966
- Don't scare me.
- What is this?

1272
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:37,070
If you won't beat me up, then I will
get your money from her new lover.

1273
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,742
Don't beat me up.
What happen there?

1274
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:41,740
Jose has gotten drunk
and is beating her up.

1275
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:43,911
She asked him about the gas cylinder
which he sold in the liquor shop.

1276
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:45,312
We have informed the police.

1277
01:23:45,537 --> 01:23:46,242
Sister, you don't interfere.

1278
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,998
You hold this cycle.
Sister, don't go.

1279
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:55,255
- My Jesus.
- I will thrash you.

1280
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,518
- Please help me.
- Move.

1281
01:23:57,716 --> 01:24:00,925
Jose. Leave her.
Elsamma, you go.

1282
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:04,927
Jose will do whatever he wants
to do with his wife.

1283
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:09,435
No one should come to Jose's house
for questioning about it. Get out.

1284
01:24:10,395 --> 01:24:12,515
If you drink liquor, keep that
in your stomach itself.

1285
01:24:18,236 --> 01:24:20,011
The police has come to my house.

1286
01:24:20,205 --> 01:24:24,017
Hey. Will you take a picture in your
mobile while your mother hangs?

1287
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:26,448
Where is Jose? Hey, come here.

1288
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,123
Sir, don't beat me up.

1289
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:31,624
If you beat up your wife after drinking,
I will break your legs.

1290
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:37,566
Sir. Don't beat him up.
Sir, please. Don't beat him up.

1291
01:24:37,756 --> 01:24:39,633
No, sir. Leave him.

1292
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:45,305
Sir. Please take that gas cylinder
from Karippalli's liquor shop.- Okay.

1293
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:50,579
Not only the gas cylinder.
Most of our utensils are there.

1294
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:53,147
Sir, my mobile.
I will give you one.

1295
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,298
Come to station in the evening
and take it.- Okay.

1296
01:24:59,277 --> 01:25:01,484
Ask.

1297
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:07,156
Is it too far?
Yes. Almost 4kms left.

1298
01:25:07,752 --> 01:25:09,823
There will be an
auto-rickshaw there, right?

1299
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:12,058
Yes. But we will go walking.

1300
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:16,166
Sisters, you want to see the route through
which your sister rides this cycle daily.

1301
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:17,461
Yes.

1302
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:19,696
Come.

1303
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,043
Come.

1304
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:38,952
Climbing again.

1305
01:25:40,018 --> 01:25:41,691
Sister.

1306
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:46,865
Go. Go.

1307
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,197
Nothing will happen without going there.

1308
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:54,100
Sister. Sister Lalitha.
Who is this, Elsamma?

1309
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:56,871
- My sisters.
- I understood.

1310
01:25:57,669 --> 01:25:59,478
- Suresh?
- He is taking a bath.

1311
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:18,562
Son. Look who has come.

1312
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,909
- Suresh. Come.
- Go.

1313
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:28,907
My dear son.

1314
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:44,253
Come. My sweet heart.

1315
01:26:46,384 --> 01:26:47,590
Suresh.

1316
01:26:48,586 --> 01:26:52,830
See what I have brought for you.
Look. This is Suresh.

1317
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:57,391
Everybody was laughing on hearing that these
people spent the night sleepless, with a tape.

1318
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:00,170
They are waiting to see me
do something wrong.

1319
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,945
Only then they can live
as they want to.

1320
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:07,674
Take out that water kept for it.
Othenlvise I will give you a tight slap.

1321
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,552
Let's go away from here
before she comes here.

1322
01:27:11,743 --> 01:27:13,620
As it is, my time is going bad. Come.

1323
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,950
Okay, then. I'm going.
Drink tea and go.

1324
01:27:16,214 --> 01:27:20,287
They are tired. They have to walk a lot.
Give them tea.

1325
01:27:20,551 --> 01:27:26,797
You drink tea and come.
I will come tomorrow.- See.

1326
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:31,133
Why did you come here?

1327
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:34,970
That... cow... to cut a little more grass.
Oh, did you cut it?

1328
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,480
Thomachan has also come
for that, right?

1329
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,842
No. I have come here to
see him cut the grass.

1330
01:27:40,438 --> 01:27:44,477
Then do your work.
It became shameful.

1331
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:49,489
Palunni. She is a god-fearing girl.
She won't fall in love with anyone.

1332
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,490
So I won't lose my money.

1333
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:54,090
I will get more.
You will give me some again.

1334
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,332
See you tomorrow.
Okay. We will meet.

1335
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,000
That is nice. It must be nicely chilled.
Bring it fast.

1336
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:02,830
- Take it fast.
- I'm bringing it.

1337
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,165
What a place is this!

1338
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,342
Not only excise,
even the military won't find it.

1339
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:07,841
Not only you can make
liquor for Balan Pillai city..

1340
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:09,843
You can make sufficient liquor
to supply the entire Kerala.- Bring.

1341
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:14,509
Bring everything.
Prawns, fish. Everything.

1342
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,778
When the vegetables were getting boiled
on the stove, she shouted by saying,

1343
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:21,081
"That utensil is mine, sir".
That's gone, too.

1344
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,619
My gas cylinder is also gone.

1345
01:28:22,814 --> 01:28:25,351
Elsamma will be happy only
after taking my gas as well.

1346
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:32,365
Son. My firing youth. You should take
one of her bones and give me.

1347
01:28:32,657 --> 01:28:35,297
I will. I surely will.
Member, you drink.

1348
01:28:35,493 --> 01:28:38,872
Look. We will go from here after
cheering you people up.

1349
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:43,043
I've earned a bad name that I killed Elsamma's
father by running him down with the vehicle.

1350
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:46,605
But if things go like this, I will kill her
by hitting her with a tripper.

1351
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:52,487
Don't kill my Elsamma.
I want her unhurt.

1352
01:28:53,011 --> 01:28:56,549
I'm going to use my 18th trick
for seducing her.

1353
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:10,253
Central.

1354
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:23,080
“Hey, butterfly with spherical wings.“
“Come to my garden along with me.“

1355
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:30,419
“Hey, butterfly with spherical wings.“
“Come to my garden along with me.“

1356
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:34,757
“There is honey of flower is.“
“There is a nice breeze.“

1357
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,760
“You come and enjoy there.“

1358
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:46,272
“Hey, butterfly with spherical wings.“
“Come to my garden along with me.“

1359
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:08,311
Central.

1360
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:22,475
“Don't show me tricks.“
“Don't commit a fraud.“

1361
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:26,479
“I can recognize silk
and the trap.“

1362
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:30,312
“Don't show me tricks.“
“Don't commit a fraud.“

1363
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:33,648
“I can recognize silk
and the trap.“

1364
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:37,657
“You are the Goddess in the forest.“
“I have begged you.“

1365
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:41,490
“Your ears have come in
search of my song.“

1366
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:45,327
“You are a fraudster.“
“You are like a pin inside the banana.“

1367
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:49,164
“Don't come to me saying sweet words.“
“Go without saying anything sweet.“

1368
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:53,672
“Then the wild cat which hides
in you will come out.“

1369
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:57,005
“By sticking out the tongue
and touching the moustache.“

1370
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:01,510
“Then the wild cat which hides
in you will come out.“

1371
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:05,017
“By sticking out the tongue
and touching the moustache.“

1372
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:23,386
Central.

1373
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:33,376
“No need of the branch to live.“
“I won't go inside the sack.“

1374
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:37,212
“This butterfly will break big rocks
rather than being with you.“

1375
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:41,220
“No need of the branch to live.“
“I won't go inside the sack.“

1376
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:44,552
“This butterfly will break big rocks
rather than being with you.“

1377
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:48,390
“Like a white pigeon.“
“You have come to me.“

1378
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:52,398
“I have floated my love in front of you.“

1379
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:56,231
“You are luxurious.“
“You are a headache.“

1380
01:31:56,427 --> 01:32:00,239
“Don't show me your city circus.“
“Go away without playing.“

1381
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:04,243
“See the bronze utensils
plated with gold.“

1382
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:07,905
“They were faded because
of the wind.“

1383
01:32:08,272 --> 01:32:12,414
“See the bronze utensils
plated with gold.“

1384
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:16,080
“They were faded because
of the wind.“

1385
01:32:16,514 --> 01:32:24,262
“Hey, butterfly with spherical wings.“
“Come to my garden along with me.“

1386
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:31,703
“Hey, butterfly with spherical wings.“
“Come to my garden along with me.“

1387
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:43,683
What is this, Palunni? New cows?

1388
01:32:43,874 --> 01:32:45,615
Yes. Now I bought them
from Thoprankudi.

1389
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,084
If things keep going like this,

1390
01:32:47,378 --> 01:32:51,155
he will get the award for the
best cattle farmer. Right, Mother?

1391
01:32:51,382 --> 01:32:53,102
Then you have to put the
news and the photo.

1392
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:54,626
Nothing.

1393
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,629
When a proposal comes,
the bride's party should feel

1394
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,967
that there is sufficient income for
their girl to live comfortably.

1395
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,402
That's why we bought the cows.

1396
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,136
If the bride who comes here
shuts her nose because..

1397
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:06,408
Of the smell of cow dung,
then everything is over.

1398
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:09,478
She will go back that time itself.
All girls are not like that.

1399
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,754
What's Elsamma's opinion
regarding this cow dung?

1400
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:15,306
We are poor people.
The smell of dung is like perfume.

1401
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:17,986
Elsamma. Is your mother
there in the house?

1402
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:20,985
I want to talk to her about
something important.

1403
01:33:21,512 --> 01:33:23,657
She is roaming here and
there talking about the church.

1404
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,820
You can meet her in the evening.
The doctor..

1405
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,657
Hey. No proposal for you now.
A doctor needs a good bride.

1406
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:31,213
Come. I want to tell you something.
Let me finish my talk.

1407
01:33:31,622 --> 01:33:35,001
Sharadamma, what do you want?
Tea or coffee?- Tea.

1408
01:33:35,826 --> 01:33:37,999
Mathachan. Two cups of tea.
Tell me.

1409
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:40,309
Why do you want to meet her mother?

1410
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:42,272
I told you not to bring a proposal for her.

1411
01:33:42,466 --> 01:33:44,673
Then how long will I wait? What?

1412
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:45,869
Elsamma.

1413
01:33:46,637 --> 01:33:48,776
Is she your sister that
you're getting so sad?

1414
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:53,279
Brother, for brokers,
all girls are sisters.

1415
01:33:53,744 --> 01:33:58,090
Earlier, God would write a broker's name
in each and every girl's destiny.

1416
01:33:58,549 --> 01:34:02,622
But now through satellite, they are sending
missed call to these girls' cell phones.

1417
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:08,702
Besides that, if there are boys like you,
how will people like us live?

1418
01:34:08,993 --> 01:34:10,529
- Give me Rs. 500.
- Rs. 500?

1419
01:34:10,828 --> 01:34:12,873
What is this? A charge for taking a look?
The charge is not for looking.

1420
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:14,041
- I won't give you.
- You won't?

1421
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:15,203
- Yes.
- Elsamma.

1422
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:18,547
Doesn't allow me to crack a joke, too?
Wants Rs. 500?

1423
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:20,215
- Yes. I need it.
- Hey, Palunni.

1424
01:34:20,404 --> 01:34:23,214
Yes. Give me 10 litres of
milk extra tomorrow.

1425
01:34:23,407 --> 01:34:24,551
What happened?
Is it your wedding?

1426
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:27,215
Wedding? Who fixed the marriage
without my knowledge?

1427
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:28,886
- It's not my wedding.
- Then?

1428
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,891
Tomorrow onwards, sand is supposed
to be taken from Karippalli's quarry.

1429
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:33,896
There might be 25 labors.
Food has been arranged here.

1430
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,565
Don't come late. Bring it early.
Okay.

1431
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:46,589
Central.

1432
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:53,407
Karipalli's JCB has come
in the morning itself.

1433
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:55,749
They will break the mountains
and destroy this village.

1434
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:59,084
Member Remanan is there
to support him.

1435
01:34:59,844 --> 01:35:03,417
Poor people. They had voted me.
Let them say a few bad words.

1436
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:07,084
Money is needed for eating something.
Karimpalli will give you that.

1437
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:08,922
That's why I support him. Enough.

1438
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,100
Hey, children.
I'm a business man.

1439
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:14,030
I want to make money whether it is
by making liquor or selling sand.

1440
01:35:14,225 --> 01:35:17,536
You make money. You make money
by demolishing everything.

1441
01:35:17,728 --> 01:35:20,106
I and my people are with you.
There's full support for you.

1442
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:22,038
No one will do anything.

1443
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,440
Hail citizen's committee.
Hail citizen's committee.

1444
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:28,446
Arrest Karippalli.
Arrest Karippalli.

1445
01:35:28,906 --> 01:35:31,944
Stop taking sand.
Stop taking sand.

1446
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:35,454
Protect the environment.
Protect the environment.

1447
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:39,116
JCB's of Karipalli should go back.
JCB's of Karipalli should go back.

1448
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,455
Stop taking sand.
Stop taking sand.

1449
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:45,395
Protect the mountains and trees.
Protect the mountains and trees.

1450
01:35:45,856 --> 01:35:47,858
My dear mothers and sisters.

1451
01:35:48,058 --> 01:35:50,971
The sand mafia has taken
the sand from our rivers.

1452
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:54,200
Now they are targeting our mountains.

1453
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:57,236
This will create serious
environmental problems.

1454
01:35:57,435 --> 01:36:00,382
It will result in soil erosion.

1455
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:05,912
We don't allow these type of activities
which disturb the equilibrium of nature.

1456
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:08,251
Who needs her consent?

1457
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:12,987
Our member Remanan has come
here to inaugurate this agitation.

1458
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,397
I'm inviting him to the stage.

1459
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,164
Member. Please come.

1460
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,837
May I go?

1461
01:36:30,968 --> 01:36:35,178
My dear... You all know that
Karipalli Sugunan is my friend.

1462
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:40,913
But he is my enemy in
this public agitation.

1463
01:36:42,146 --> 01:36:43,853
There is no doubt about that.

1464
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:49,090
That's why I'm saying in front
of you people that we won't..

1465
01:36:49,286 --> 01:36:52,529
Allow Karipalli Sugunan's
charade in this village.

1466
01:36:56,861 --> 01:37:04,861
I'm proclaiming that if Karipalli Sugunan
doesn't take off the JCB kept here,

1467
01:37:06,871 --> 01:37:10,182
we will cut his hand itself.
Leave me. Leave.

1468
01:37:10,341 --> 01:37:15,381
Whatever he may say, he will
come to us in the evening. Come.

1469
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,454
I will show you.

1470
01:37:29,426 --> 01:37:30,426
Abymon?

1471
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:34,597
Why are you here?

1472
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,685
Has the route to Karipalli's
liquor shop changed?

1473
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,075
You can't go through here.

1474
01:37:38,435 --> 01:37:41,081
I'm not going to Karipalli's liquor shop.
I have come to the church.

1475
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:46,145
My Jesus. Jesus, thank you for
making him go on the right path.

1476
01:37:46,544 --> 01:37:48,990
I have gone to the church
because I love a girl.

1477
01:37:49,179 --> 01:37:50,249
I felt that as well.

1478
01:37:50,614 --> 01:37:55,688
These boys come to church
when they fall in love. May I go?

1479
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,022
I have to deliver papers
at 3-4 places, too.

1480
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:05,532
Do you want to know her name?
No need of that.

1481
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:09,604
If you marry that girl,
I will surely come for the wedding.

1482
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,942
You are our Paappan's grandson.
That girl's name is Elsamma.

1483
01:38:19,743 --> 01:38:21,950
True. That will ring regularly.

1484
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,617
Elsamma's performance against Karipalli
and the member in the quarry was brilliant.

1485
01:38:26,817 --> 01:38:28,797
That time onwards,
I've become your fan.

1486
01:38:30,254 --> 01:38:35,465
The feelings that Aby has for me is not love.
I can't say that in front of the church.

1487
01:38:35,759 --> 01:38:39,798
This is a disease.
This is common in this age.

1488
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,744
You know why this disease
affected Aby and not me?- Why?

1489
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:48,916
Aby doesn't have any work.
I have lots of work.

1490
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,341
I don't have time, Aby.

1491
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:55,820
You go and propose some other
girl who has time. Okay?

1492
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,227
- Go...
- Sugar boy. Come back.

1493
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:14,173
“Frying banana.“

1494
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:21,342
No sugar for tea.

1495
01:39:25,609 --> 01:39:26,609
Here.

1496
01:39:28,112 --> 01:39:29,112
- Have you heard?
- What?

1497
01:39:29,246 --> 01:39:33,626
Kunnel Abymon has hit Elsamma.
Where?

1498
01:39:35,019 --> 01:39:36,692
You should have given him
one tight slap.

1499
01:39:36,954 --> 01:39:38,763
He is a poor fellow. Right, Brother Pillai?

1500
01:39:38,956 --> 01:39:40,367
Yes.

1501
01:39:42,026 --> 01:39:45,030
Poor man? Came to disturb you?

1502
01:39:47,564 --> 01:39:52,035
Hey, I don't mean that he
hit Elsamma's body.

1503
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:52,907
Then?

1504
01:39:53,103 --> 01:39:56,277
- The other one.
- What?

1505
01:39:56,974 --> 01:39:59,648
Abymon is in love with me.

1506
01:39:59,843 --> 01:40:05,623
He told me that he loves me a lot
and told me to give him a reply.

1507
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:09,022
Then what did..
Then what did you say?

1508
01:40:09,219 --> 01:40:11,059
I told him that I will tell him
after sometime.

1509
01:40:11,155 --> 01:40:13,075
You could have told him no
at that moment itself.

1510
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:13,995
For what?

1511
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:16,398
Hello. There is no sugar in it.

1512
01:40:17,327 --> 01:40:21,901
Even then.. I won't believe that he said all
these things to you by looking at your face.

1513
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:24,136
Is my face so bad, Brother Pillai?
No.

1514
01:40:24,334 --> 01:40:27,042
I liked his courage.
He felt that he loves a girl.

1515
01:40:27,237 --> 01:40:28,580
He told her directly.

1516
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:31,413
Boys are like that.

1517
01:40:31,842 --> 01:40:33,651
Oh, what courage is this!

1518
01:40:33,844 --> 01:40:35,983
He might have been doing
the same in Ernakulam, too.

1519
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,353
Are you putting sugar in this or not?

1520
01:40:38,549 --> 01:40:40,654
I'm fed up of him.

1521
01:40:42,086 --> 01:40:47,331
See this. Take.

1522
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,302
Four cups of tea.

1523
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:06,246
I have stopped tea with sugar because the
diabetics in this village are increasing.

1524
01:41:06,443 --> 01:41:08,043
Do you want it without sugar?
Without it?

1525
01:41:08,112 --> 01:41:09,216
Take anything.

1526
01:41:09,413 --> 01:41:11,188
Mathan, Take four cups without sugar.
Okay.

1527
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:14,692
Is there any special news
in the paper?

1528
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:17,029
Balan Pillai city.

1529
01:41:17,755 --> 01:41:23,205
A 20-year-old girl was brutally raped.

1530
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:26,031
Very nice.

1531
01:41:32,903 --> 01:41:34,041
Don't laugh too much.

1532
01:41:34,404 --> 01:41:37,977
I will write news in this paper because of
which your people will be laughed at.

1533
01:41:38,242 --> 01:41:41,416
This face would be there in it.
The police will also be there.

1534
01:41:41,612 --> 01:41:43,216
Elsamma is saying this.

1535
01:41:49,253 --> 01:41:50,253
Hey.

1536
01:41:51,755 --> 01:41:56,329
Aby's approach and Karipalli's
people's paper reading.

1537
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,666
There is some conspiracy.

1538
01:41:59,062 --> 01:42:02,066
Aby and his friends are in Karipalli
liquor shop 24 hours a day.

1539
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:05,347
Take a decision after
thinking it through.

1540
01:42:06,637 --> 01:42:07,741
What decision?

1541
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:14,186
The reply to what Aby asked you.
I just told you my doubt.

1542
01:42:15,445 --> 01:42:16,445
May I go?

1543
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:21,884
Els...

1544
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:27,024
I was going to say something.
I forgot.

1545
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:34,098
RS. 38.50.

1546
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:37,037
Write in Karipalli's account.
Okay.

1547
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:41,571
Hey, Omana.

1548
01:42:44,508 --> 01:42:46,215
You see this, too.

1549
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:53,220
Hey, Omana, how are you?
I'm fine.

1550
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,418
I know that.

1551
01:42:54,618 --> 01:42:55,392
- Remanan.
- Yes.

1552
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:57,293
We are childhood friends. Okay.

1553
01:42:57,487 --> 01:43:00,730
The beauty which doesn't replenish
in the rain and sun, Omaha.

1554
01:43:01,191 --> 01:43:04,138
When I saw you, my heart started paining.
That's why I said this.

1555
01:43:04,728 --> 01:43:07,106
Hey. I need your help.

1556
01:43:07,297 --> 01:43:09,436
This Sugunan will do anything for you.

1557
01:43:09,633 --> 01:43:11,135
Do you want money? Then tell me.

1558
01:43:11,335 --> 01:43:12,575
You tell me what the matter is.

1559
01:43:13,203 --> 01:43:15,114
End your friendship with Elsamma.

1560
01:43:15,305 --> 01:43:17,751
She is shining in the strength of
your Vanithashree group.

1561
01:43:17,941 --> 01:43:20,148
You have to stop that.
You should avoid her.

1562
01:43:20,344 --> 01:43:21,344
Is it possible?

1563
01:43:21,678 --> 01:43:23,385
I like Sugunan.

1564
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:26,220
But I won't do anything
against Elsamma.

1565
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:28,157
She is our boy.

1566
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,998
I told you earlier that she
has a good hold.

1567
01:43:33,323 --> 01:43:34,324
You didn't listen that.

1568
01:43:35,659 --> 01:43:37,935
- Member.
- Yes.

1569
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:39,128
Come here.

1570
01:43:39,196 --> 01:43:40,698
- Get in.
- No.

1571
01:43:41,765 --> 01:43:43,073
- Get and sit inside.
- No.

1572
01:43:43,267 --> 01:43:45,879
Is Elsamma more important for you or am I?
I want to know that now itself.

1573
01:43:45,903 --> 01:43:48,315
Should I live or die?
I want to know that now itself.

1574
01:43:48,505 --> 01:43:51,213
Oh, that's how things are, are they?
Yes. They are.

1575
01:43:51,408 --> 01:43:52,785
Member... Take the vehicle.

1576
01:43:55,212 --> 01:43:57,692
What happened, Elsamma?
Why did you call me?

1577
01:43:58,148 --> 01:43:59,788
The village council elections are coming.

1578
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,820
Member, do you think that you
will win this year?

1579
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,180
What is there to doubt about?

1580
01:44:04,354 --> 01:44:07,358
The 9th ward voters have voted and
selected me the last four times.

1581
01:44:07,557 --> 01:44:09,662
They won't leave me. I will win.

1582
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:10,668
You won't win.

1583
01:44:10,861 --> 01:44:13,967
Distribution of 2000 copies of love letter
that you wrote for Sainaba.

1584
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:15,575
Sainaba's speech.

1585
01:44:16,266 --> 01:44:18,542
Don't try to cook that during
the elections.

1586
01:44:18,735 --> 01:44:20,695
What is the proof that I have
written that letter?

1587
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:22,714
I will prove that it was not
my hand writing.

1588
01:44:22,906 --> 01:44:26,046
Is there anyone to contest
against me in the 9th ward?

1589
01:44:26,777 --> 01:44:28,279
VS Elsamma Varkey.

1590
01:44:29,313 --> 01:44:31,657
- Who is that?
- You?

1591
01:44:32,049 --> 01:44:33,049
Yes.

1592
01:44:33,917 --> 01:44:34,691
Is it needed?

1593
01:44:34,885 --> 01:44:39,664
After making the men in this village drink
fake liquor and making their wives suffer.

1594
01:44:39,856 --> 01:44:43,929
Keeping friendship with Karipalli Sugunan
who sells the sand of this village.

1595
01:44:44,127 --> 01:44:45,868
Taking a bottle for signing.

1596
01:44:46,063 --> 01:44:50,239
I will easily defeat Remanan whose image
has been completely damaged.

1597
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,477
Don't say anything like this.
I have failed now itself.

1598
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:55,650
Don't fail me in elections, too.

1599
01:44:55,906 --> 01:44:57,717
I'm not used to hard work.

1600
01:44:57,741 --> 01:44:59,550
I will obey whatever you say.

1601
01:44:59,743 --> 01:45:03,714
Then member Remanan should change
his image in front of the public.

1602
01:45:03,914 --> 01:45:06,087
You should.
I will. I will change.

1603
01:45:06,516 --> 01:45:09,520
- Remanan.
- Go.

1604
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:11,522
You want a reply, right?

1605
01:45:13,023 --> 01:45:17,028
- Remanan, are you going?
- Yes.

1606
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:23,837
I don't feel like going away from here.
Why so?

1607
01:45:24,034 --> 01:45:25,638
I can't live without seeing you, Treesa.

1608
01:45:25,836 --> 01:45:29,113
When I reach my house, I will tell my
papa and mummy about Tresa.

1609
01:45:29,306 --> 01:45:30,944
That's not needed. It is needed.

1610
01:45:31,808 --> 01:45:36,052
I want to talk to you a lot
before I go from here.

1611
01:45:36,446 --> 01:45:39,606
Will you come early in the morning when
Elsamma goes for the paper distribution?

1612
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:40,750
I'm scared.

1613
01:45:40,817 --> 01:45:43,161
If you love me, you will come.
Will you come?

1614
01:45:43,353 --> 01:45:45,355
I do love you, but still..

1615
01:45:45,555 --> 01:45:48,729
- Then agree to come.
- That..

1616
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:53,639
Tresa. My mother.

1617
01:45:55,899 --> 01:45:56,900
Are you teaching her?

1618
01:45:57,667 --> 01:46:00,648
I just asked her about her studies.

1619
01:46:00,837 --> 01:46:02,578
Are you planning to teach her?

1620
01:46:03,407 --> 01:46:06,388
I just asked.

1621
01:46:06,576 --> 01:46:07,680
Jerry, take the vehicle.

1622
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:10,918
Start.

1623
01:46:13,817 --> 01:46:14,817
May I go?

1624
01:46:16,753 --> 01:46:17,753
Take the vehicle.

1625
01:46:18,488 --> 01:46:19,688
Take the vehicle to the house.

1626
01:46:30,434 --> 01:46:35,179
It's bad to cheat poor girls, right?

1627
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:38,279
If you want to trick, then trick me.

1628
01:46:39,176 --> 01:46:42,123
I know a little about fraud and all.

1629
01:46:42,712 --> 01:46:44,055
Are you trying to?

1630
01:46:44,247 --> 01:46:45,247
My Elsamma, I just..

1631
01:46:45,382 --> 01:46:48,192
If you come to that area
with sweet words...

1632
01:46:57,461 --> 01:46:58,531
Where is mother?

1633
01:46:59,062 --> 01:47:01,303
She has gone to the church
in the morning.

1634
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:19,219
Is there anything to eat?
There is Tapioca.

1635
01:47:20,417 --> 01:47:21,896
Give me a little coffee, too.

1636
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:24,855
Keep that down.

1637
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:40,348
That.. When that boyjust
asked something...

1638
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:42,175
There is nothing in that.

1639
01:47:44,074 --> 01:47:45,678
Sister, don't you believe me?

1640
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:56,378
Central.

1641
01:48:02,659 --> 01:48:05,105
What happened, Mother?
You look tired.

1642
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:08,035
I feel tired. May be because of walking.

1643
01:48:08,398 --> 01:48:11,106
You tell Leena to give me something.

1644
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:13,575
I'm fed up of telling you.

1645
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:15,875
There are three grown up girls
in this house.

1646
01:48:16,106 --> 01:48:19,952
If we keep them carefully, even then
there are some people to take them.

1647
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,890
Some others are there to enjoy if
the news comes in the papers.

1648
01:48:25,348 --> 01:48:27,225
I'm 2-3 years older than them.

1649
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:29,055
But even then, I'm a girl like them.

1650
01:48:29,419 --> 01:48:32,059
I have a limit.

1651
01:48:36,526 --> 01:48:40,064
I haven't slept at night at all after
3-4 boys came in that house.

1652
01:48:40,263 --> 01:48:41,298
Mother, do you know that?

1653
01:48:42,866 --> 01:48:44,243
I do.

1654
01:48:48,338 --> 01:48:50,648
My children won't get destroyed.

1655
01:48:53,276 --> 01:48:56,086
Now onwards, I won't go anywhere.
Enough?

1656
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:13,798
Do you want tea?
No. But you tell me the truth.

1657
01:49:13,997 --> 01:49:16,807
Are you afraid of me?
Because of what?

1658
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,277
For the incident in the morning.
Oh, I already forgot that.

1659
01:49:20,503 --> 01:49:22,676
If Aby cracks a joke,
I won't take it so seriously.

1660
01:49:22,872 --> 01:49:24,874
Then, too, I'm tensed.

1661
01:49:25,075 --> 01:49:28,113
Oh, by looking at your face,
I know that there is no tension.

1662
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:31,485
You have become a little glamorous.
Is it? Don't lie.

1663
01:49:31,681 --> 01:49:33,183
- It's true?
- True.

1664
01:49:43,226 --> 01:49:45,706
What is this, Abymon?
What do you mean by closing the door..

1665
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:51,145
I want to tell Elsamma something.
Tell me. I will listen.

1666
01:49:52,769 --> 01:49:54,544
But, Elsamma, don't become violent.

1667
01:49:55,071 --> 01:49:57,642
Anyway, Elsamma, you won't love me, right?
Yes.

1668
01:49:58,108 --> 01:50:01,385
- That hope is over. $0..
- So?

1669
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:05,452
The day I saw Elsamma..
Tell me fast.

1670
01:50:05,649 --> 01:50:07,424
I have had a thirst.

1671
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:10,225
Do you feel this thirst
when you see all girls?

1672
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:13,060
I promise in the name of virgin Mary.
No. Only when I see Elsamma.

1673
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:14,926
Can I close my eyes? No.

1674
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:15,899
What is the reason?

1675
01:50:16,092 --> 01:50:18,572
My eyes are full of Elsamma.
See.

1676
01:50:22,532 --> 01:50:26,947
I don't know why. When Elsamma comes
near me my heart starts beating faster.

1677
01:50:27,137 --> 01:50:28,137
Touch and see.

1678
01:50:30,106 --> 01:50:32,347
If you touch my body, you will fall down.

1679
01:50:32,776 --> 01:50:38,283
Can't I crack a joke with Elsamma?
This is too much.

1680
01:50:38,481 --> 01:50:39,481
Elsamma.

1681
01:50:41,217 --> 01:50:43,561
Elsamma. Why did you close the door?

1682
01:50:43,753 --> 01:50:45,027
Why did you close...

1683
01:50:48,825 --> 01:50:50,745
I came here to tell Elsamma
something personally.

1684
01:50:50,827 --> 01:50:52,704
Aby, aren't you ashamed to talk to her?

1685
01:50:54,297 --> 01:50:55,935
What happened, Elsamma?
That.. l..

1686
01:50:56,132 --> 01:50:56,803
I will tell you.

1687
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,274
Paappan... that..

1688
01:51:01,504 --> 01:51:05,111
What happened?
Did you misbehave with her?

1689
01:51:05,442 --> 01:51:08,218
I want to marry Elsamma.

1690
01:51:09,579 --> 01:51:11,058
For telling her that..

1691
01:51:11,448 --> 01:51:14,224
What nonsense are you talking, Aby!
Are you mad?

1692
01:51:14,484 --> 01:51:16,644
You don't interfere in this.
I'm saying this seriously.

1693
01:51:16,686 --> 01:51:18,927
I want to marry Elsamma.
I'm going to inform papa.

1694
01:51:19,122 --> 01:51:21,068
I won't allow it.
I don't need your consent.

1695
01:51:21,257 --> 01:51:22,297
I have taken the decision.

1696
01:51:33,236 --> 01:51:34,271
Bring it fast.

1697
01:51:35,605 --> 01:51:36,605
Come.

1698
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:38,540
Come.

1699
01:51:42,345 --> 01:51:45,849
This time, we should make nice liquor.

1700
01:51:46,216 --> 01:51:47,593
Pour.

1701
01:51:59,162 --> 01:52:01,164
You drink and see.

1702
01:52:16,646 --> 01:52:19,126
This is Karipalli special.

1703
01:52:21,451 --> 01:52:24,193
- How is it?
- Very nice.

1704
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:26,629
Hold me safely.

1705
01:52:28,024 --> 01:52:29,025
Look, Elsamma.

1706
01:52:29,659 --> 01:52:32,469
My Jesus. What is this?

1707
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:34,137
I'm happy-

1708
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,970
Elsamma, we have gone to
buy the utensils.

1709
01:52:36,032 --> 01:52:39,172
Last month, when I made barter
and searched for the pot..

1710
01:52:39,369 --> 01:52:40,489
I found that it was missing.

1711
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:43,048
Anyway, he has bought a new one.

1712
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,340
Okay, then.

1713
01:52:53,783 --> 01:52:54,591
Hello.

1714
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:58,630
He started making liquor again.
The business is going on well.

1715
01:52:58,922 --> 01:53:00,162
Member, you go away from there.

1716
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:02,210
The police and excise will
come there now itself.

1717
01:53:02,358 --> 01:53:03,358
Okay.

1718
01:53:08,565 --> 01:53:09,565
Hello.

1719
01:53:16,105 --> 01:53:17,846
Boss. Excise.

1720
01:53:18,241 --> 01:53:21,586
Hey, run. Run.

1721
01:53:32,922 --> 01:53:34,799
Hey, come here.

1722
01:53:35,024 --> 01:53:36,526
Take fast. Take.

1723
01:53:36,726 --> 01:53:38,603
Check whatever is here.

1724
01:53:39,963 --> 01:53:40,737
Take him. Fast. Fast.

1725
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:44,537
Come.

1726
01:53:48,404 --> 01:53:49,404
Move aside.

1727
01:53:50,406 --> 01:53:53,285
Sir, if you remove their shirts and keep
that can on their head,

1728
01:53:53,476 --> 01:53:54,720
Then it would make a nice photograph.

1729
01:53:54,744 --> 01:53:59,215
Hey. Remove your shirt. Remove it.

1730
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:04,253
Take.

1731
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:11,997
Arrest liquor king Karipalli.
Arrest liquor king Karipalli.

1732
01:54:12,195 --> 01:54:16,871
Make Balan Pillai city liquor-free.
Make Balan Pillai city liquorfree.

1733
01:54:17,066 --> 01:54:20,013
Remanan is our leader.
Remanan is our leader.

1734
01:54:20,203 --> 01:54:23,480
We will close the liquor shop.
We will close the liquor shop.

1735
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:25,551
My dear villagers.

1736
01:54:25,742 --> 01:54:29,519
We'll lock the liquor shop
which Karipalli Sugunan...

1737
01:54:29,812 --> 01:54:33,885
has made with mother and
sister's wedding chain.

1738
01:54:40,657 --> 01:54:43,900
<i>Karma is not Gods own country now.</i>

1739
01:54:44,093 --> 01:54:48,599
Now it has become a place full of people

1740
01:54:50,733 --> 01:54:58,733
who tell us to buy a full bottle when they
hear that their mother passed away.

1741
01:54:59,609 --> 01:55:03,250
I'm proclaiming that I will make
this Balan Pillai city

1742
01:55:03,446 --> 01:55:06,484
liquor-free by eradicating the people's
habit of drinking liquor.

1743
01:55:09,886 --> 01:55:13,959
A bottle for signing.
Earlier, I had told you this.

1744
01:55:14,157 --> 01:55:16,967
Now I need your love instead
of the bottle.

1745
01:55:17,727 --> 01:55:25,407
I'm proclaiming that I and my people won't
drink liquor from today onwards.

1746
01:55:33,209 --> 01:55:35,052
Now for the attention
of SI Sunandappan.

1747
01:55:36,279 --> 01:55:38,190
No use of standing here
and looking at the ladies.

1748
01:55:38,214 --> 01:55:43,664
If you don't arrest Karipalli Sugunan by
next march we will go to police station.

1749
01:55:49,659 --> 01:55:50,659
Come here.

1750
01:55:52,095 --> 01:55:54,097
I'm expressing my.

1751
01:55:54,330 --> 01:56:00,542
Your and this Balan Pillai city's
gratitude towards Elsamma, a little girl.

1752
01:56:00,737 --> 01:56:08,019
No, a little boy who has worked hard
to shut down this liquor shop.

1753
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:10,080
Crackers. Fire.

1754
01:56:10,279 --> 01:56:11,349
Crackers.

1755
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:23,829
Come out and break.

1756
01:56:25,128 --> 01:56:26,505
Hey, come. Hey, come.

1757
01:56:26,696 --> 01:56:27,470
Break it.

1758
01:56:27,664 --> 01:56:28,699
Hey, break it.

1759
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,917
Where is your sister?
Please don't break it.

1760
01:56:39,108 --> 01:56:39,882
She wants to do social service.

1761
01:56:40,076 --> 01:56:41,076
Mother.

1762
01:56:41,244 --> 01:56:42,621
I will show you. Mother.

1763
01:56:42,812 --> 01:56:44,792
What is she thinking about her?

1764
01:56:45,748 --> 01:56:49,321
What happened? Jesus. My Jesus.

1765
01:56:49,519 --> 01:56:51,897
Leave my goats alone.
Hey, leave.

1766
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:53,590
<i>Hey. I will..</i>

1767
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:55,497
Hey. Move. Go away.

1768
01:56:55,692 --> 01:57:00,004
Hey. Don't do that. Hey, no.

1769
01:57:00,196 --> 01:57:02,176
Go away.

1770
01:57:05,668 --> 01:57:06,874
Mother.

1771
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,251
Paappan is there inside.

1772
01:57:21,417 --> 01:57:22,760
Paappan. Nothing to worry about.

1773
01:57:22,952 --> 01:57:24,659
A small wound. That's all.

1774
01:57:25,388 --> 01:57:27,561
Now she regained consciousness.
Brought to the ward.

1775
01:57:27,757 --> 01:57:28,757
You go there.

1776
01:57:31,961 --> 01:57:39,961
Central.

1777
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:46,641
Mother.

1778
01:57:48,478 --> 01:57:51,789
Nothing happened to me.
A little pain.

1779
01:57:52,448 --> 01:57:53,893
That will get over now.

1780
01:58:00,189 --> 01:58:02,601
Doctor, my pain is over.
May I go home?

1781
01:58:02,792 --> 01:58:03,361
I will discharge you.

1782
01:58:03,559 --> 01:58:06,540
Before that, I have to decide
your operation date.

1783
01:58:06,729 --> 01:58:10,575
Operation? What operation?
That..

1784
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,380
You haven't told them
anything yet, have you?

1785
01:58:15,738 --> 01:58:16,738
She hasn't.

1786
01:58:17,607 --> 01:58:18,881
We don't know anything.

1787
01:58:19,342 --> 01:58:22,880
Sister, you are smart.
She is my patient.

1788
01:58:23,079 --> 01:58:26,026
There's a tumor in her stomach.
It's a little bit big.

1789
01:58:26,215 --> 01:58:28,821
Whenever I would tell her
about the operation,

1790
01:58:29,051 --> 01:58:31,011
she used to say that
she has to auction some chit.

1791
01:58:31,087 --> 01:58:34,066
Whenever the pain would really worsen,
she would come and take pain killers.

1792
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:37,003
I had told her not to do
any hard labor work.

1793
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,237
Then she has gone in between fights.

1794
01:58:41,364 --> 01:58:43,542
She used to go in the morning by saying
that she is going to the church.

1795
01:58:43,566 --> 01:58:46,410
We don't know anything, doctor.

1796
01:58:49,972 --> 01:58:51,849
I used to go to the church itself.

1797
01:58:52,508 --> 01:58:54,920
There is a saying that we are half
and God is the other half.

1798
01:58:55,645 --> 01:58:57,488
I prayed to God to cure this.

1799
01:58:58,114 --> 01:59:01,186
Othenlvise my daughter will have to take
a loan from others for this, too.

1800
01:59:08,724 --> 01:59:09,429
Doctor, you tell me.

1801
01:59:09,625 --> 01:59:11,434
We can do operation any time.

1802
01:59:11,994 --> 01:59:12,802
We can arrange for the money.

1803
01:59:12,995 --> 01:59:14,997
Then you go from here after the operation.

1804
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:16,438
That's not possible.

1805
01:59:16,866 --> 01:59:20,712
I will get the operation done
after her marriage.

1806
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:23,716
If I die in between..

1807
01:59:23,739 --> 01:59:25,309
- Mother.
- I'm scared.

1808
01:59:26,475 --> 01:59:30,048
I'm the only person to take care of them.

1809
01:59:31,347 --> 01:59:33,554
I want to see my child's marriage.

1810
01:59:33,916 --> 01:59:35,657
I will agree only after that.

1811
01:59:35,852 --> 01:59:38,890
Is your daughter's marriage fixed?

1812
01:59:39,322 --> 01:59:39,993
Mother.

1813
01:59:40,189 --> 01:59:41,896
Then we didn't come to know about that.

1814
01:59:42,091 --> 01:59:43,161
Who is the groom?

1815
01:59:43,693 --> 01:59:44,728
Our Abymon.

1816
01:59:47,697 --> 01:59:49,734
He is Paappan's grandson, doctor.

1817
01:59:49,932 --> 01:59:53,846
He is an engineering graduate.
He liked her a lot.

1818
01:59:54,036 --> 01:59:55,674
Paappan also agreed for this.

1819
01:59:56,038 --> 01:59:59,178
My wish is to get the marriage
done immediately.

1820
01:59:59,375 --> 02:00:00,786
Let it happen.

1821
02:00:49,725 --> 02:00:50,725
Unni.

1822
02:01:00,036 --> 02:01:03,483
Brother Pillai, why are you here?

1823
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:05,584
- Unni?
- He is here.

1824
02:01:05,775 --> 02:01:07,486
He has been sleeping from
the time he came here.

1825
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:09,922
- I will call him, Sit.
- Okay.

1826
02:01:10,346 --> 02:01:13,088
Unni. Brother Pillai is calling you.

1827
02:01:23,926 --> 02:01:26,167
Paappan is very disappointed.

1828
02:01:26,729 --> 02:01:30,734
Aby has told Pappan that
he likes Elsamma.

1829
02:01:30,933 --> 02:01:36,178
Paappan didn't think that he will go
and tell that to Maria.

1830
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:41,185
Paappan couldn't say anything
on seeing Maria's happiness.

1831
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:44,847
He was planning on informing
her about you.

1832
02:01:45,047 --> 02:01:46,526
But before that..

1833
02:01:48,818 --> 02:01:52,288
He is the owner of Paapan's
entire property.

1834
02:01:52,488 --> 02:01:58,564
If Maria thinks that,
then we can't blame her.

1835
02:01:58,761 --> 02:02:03,801
Anyway, Paappan won't take any
decision without your consent.

1836
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,138
That is their concern.

1837
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:07,813
Who am I to give an opinion?

1838
02:02:08,204 --> 02:02:09,979
Let them do what they want to.

1839
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:30,251
Central.

1840
02:02:44,206 --> 02:02:50,088
Anyone will go mad if the love which was
kept in the heart for so long gets over.

1841
02:02:50,679 --> 02:02:52,852
Yesterday, that happened to me.

1842
02:02:54,850 --> 02:02:58,593
If I marry Elsamma,
I can only share her difficulties.

1843
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:00,631
But I can't solve them.

1844
02:03:02,091 --> 02:03:06,130
If I don't understand that, what is the
difference between me and this rock?

1845
02:03:08,531 --> 02:03:12,035
For me and Elsamma,
Paappan is in father's place.

1846
02:03:13,469 --> 02:03:17,281
I'm sure that you won't do anything
which will harm the two of us.

1847
02:03:18,941 --> 02:03:21,387
Paappan, you can take a decision.

1848
02:03:27,783 --> 02:03:30,457
Oh, by seeing you sitting
like this, I feel..

1849
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:31,961
Look. Take this.

1850
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:48,930
I'm sad. Then, too, please give me
a little time Paappan.

1851
02:03:51,273 --> 02:03:55,085
I'm sorry. What will this Paappan
tell you, my son?

1852
02:04:32,047 --> 02:04:33,355
Switch off the lights, children.

1853
02:04:33,816 --> 02:04:34,816
Switch them off.

1854
02:04:35,484 --> 02:04:37,964
I'm here. Here.

1855
02:04:38,254 --> 02:04:39,289
Hi.. Hi..

1856
02:04:41,357 --> 02:04:42,357
Come.

1857
02:04:42,691 --> 02:04:45,611
I'm scared that the police might come here
by tracking the mobile's range.

1858
02:04:45,694 --> 02:04:47,174
Why are you getting scared like this?

1859
02:04:47,329 --> 02:04:48,535
I'm not scared.

1860
02:04:49,098 --> 02:04:51,343
But I have saved myself from getting
thrashed by the police.

1861
02:04:51,367 --> 02:04:52,869
- Did you bring that?
- Yes.

1862
02:04:53,068 --> 02:04:54,206
Then take it.

1863
02:04:54,436 --> 02:04:56,609
- Is touchings there?
- Yes.

1864
02:04:56,805 --> 02:04:58,717
Yesterday onwards, the police was
searching you in full alert.

1865
02:04:58,741 --> 02:05:00,618
Anyway, it's good that Maria didn't die.

1866
02:05:00,809 --> 02:05:02,254
The case is that of an attempt to murder.

1867
02:05:02,278 --> 02:05:04,087
My brother-in-law will get a bail tomorrow.

1868
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:06,385
No one will find this place.
Okay.

1869
02:05:06,582 --> 02:05:09,995
But I'm scared to sit alone in the night.
That's why I called you.

1870
02:05:10,219 --> 02:05:11,994
Now I won't trust anyone else.

1871
02:05:12,855 --> 02:05:14,926
Where is the other one? That Jerry.

1872
02:05:15,624 --> 02:05:17,228
He has gratitude towards Karipalli.

1873
02:05:17,426 --> 02:05:19,702
Elsamma's sister, that Tresa,
you know.- Yes.

1874
02:05:19,895 --> 02:05:21,169
He will kidnap her today.

1875
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:23,002
Will anything happen?

1876
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:26,242
Sure.

1877
02:05:27,469 --> 02:05:28,914
Very nice.

1878
02:06:24,026 --> 02:06:25,026
Hey, Sherine.

1879
02:06:37,606 --> 02:06:39,415
We.. We were talking about something.

1880
02:06:39,608 --> 02:06:40,245
Sherine, you go.

1881
02:06:40,442 --> 02:06:42,319
Elsamma, you don't think..
Shut up.

1882
02:06:42,878 --> 02:06:47,657
If I shout, people will get here.
Then his bones won't even exist.

1883
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:50,756
I'm not doing that because
of Paappan and Dinamma.

1884
02:06:50,953 --> 02:06:53,513
But because of the reputation
of this family. Sherine, go inside.

1885
02:06:54,256 --> 02:06:55,428
Hey, go inside.

1886
02:07:01,997 --> 02:07:03,874
For me, my Tresa and she are the same.

1887
02:07:04,366 --> 02:07:06,346
If you show your insolent
behavior here or there

1888
02:07:06,568 --> 02:07:08,368
then you won't go back
in the best of health.

1889
02:07:08,804 --> 02:07:10,382
You should leave this place
tomorrow morning itself.

1890
02:07:10,406 --> 02:07:11,406
Go.

1891
02:07:39,935 --> 02:07:40,935
Unni.

1892
02:07:45,908 --> 02:07:47,319
Palunni is better.

1893
02:07:48,877 --> 02:07:50,220
I want to tell you something.

1894
02:07:57,019 --> 02:07:58,430
Hi, Palunni.

1895
02:07:59,688 --> 02:08:01,497
I want to tell you something.

1896
02:08:01,924 --> 02:08:04,700
Don't create any problems on hearing
what I'm about to say.

1897
02:08:04,893 --> 02:08:06,839
Don't tell this to Paappan and Dinamma.

1898
02:08:07,162 --> 02:08:08,402
You tell me what the matter is.

1899
02:08:09,098 --> 02:08:11,669
If Aby comes to know about this,
then it would be a big problem.

1900
02:08:12,034 --> 02:08:14,674
That's why Elsamma told me
to inform you everything.

1901
02:08:15,804 --> 02:08:19,616
Elsamma has seen Jerry and Sherine in a
compromising situation

1902
02:08:19,808 --> 02:08:22,288
inside the rubber-sheet-making hut.

1903
02:08:23,212 --> 02:08:25,818
You should handle this without
letting others know about it.

1904
02:08:35,457 --> 02:08:38,563
There's a call from Jerry's father.
We were supposed to inform you about it.

1905
02:08:38,761 --> 02:08:41,708
Hey. What idiocy have you done?

1906
02:08:42,131 --> 02:08:44,543
Aby. Leave him. Leave him.
Listen to what I'm saying.

1907
02:08:47,035 --> 02:08:48,412
Jerry. Jerry.

1908
02:08:48,604 --> 02:08:49,604
Jerry.

1909
02:08:53,475 --> 02:08:54,681
Sister Elsa.

1910
02:09:00,582 --> 02:09:02,892
- What happened?
- There.

1911
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,890
Leave him. Aby.

1912
02:09:12,761 --> 02:09:13,967
Jerry. Jerry. No.

1913
02:09:14,163 --> 02:09:17,633
Don't beat him up.
Hey, listen to me.

1914
02:09:17,966 --> 02:09:18,966
Stop it.

1915
02:09:19,468 --> 02:09:21,470
Why are you beating him up like this?

1916
02:09:22,337 --> 02:09:25,409
You listen to what I'm saying.
Aby. Stop it.

1917
02:09:25,607 --> 02:09:28,884
You are also supporting his nonsense.
This is not nonsense.

1918
02:09:29,077 --> 02:09:31,318
I love Jerry. We are in love.

1919
02:09:31,513 --> 02:09:32,924
What you know about him?

1920
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:36,591
She doesn't know about you either.
Tell her that, too.

1921
02:09:36,785 --> 02:09:37,923
What you said is true.

1922
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:40,396
We have misbehaved with a lot of girls.

1923
02:09:40,589 --> 02:09:42,364
I have seen her to be one amongst them.

1924
02:09:43,692 --> 02:09:45,831
This is not true love or something.

1925
02:09:46,395 --> 02:09:47,395
Hey, come.

1926
02:09:57,005 --> 02:09:58,541
Daughter. Sherine.

1927
02:10:00,909 --> 02:10:01,944
Hey, what is going on?

1928
02:10:05,347 --> 02:10:06,417
Hey, what is going on?

1929
02:10:06,548 --> 02:10:08,391
There is some problem between
Aby and Jerry.

1930
02:10:15,991 --> 02:10:18,665
Aby. Aby. What is this?
Paappan, tell them to stop.

1931
02:10:18,794 --> 02:10:20,671
Do you know what he has done?

1932
02:10:20,762 --> 02:10:24,162
You should think about all this before you
bring dirty people like this to your house.

1933
02:10:24,233 --> 02:10:25,644
We are dirty people.

1934
02:10:25,834 --> 02:10:27,973
But the person standing here
is worse than us.

1935
02:10:28,637 --> 02:10:31,550
He tried to seduce Elsamma.

1936
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:33,852
When he failed, he played a new trick.
That is marriage.

1937
02:10:33,876 --> 02:10:35,082
Othenlvise, let him tell.

1938
02:10:36,044 --> 02:10:37,580
Hey, leave him. Leave him.

1939
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:55,401
You don't know.

1940
02:10:55,964 --> 02:10:59,002
We are living as one family.
As one family.

1941
02:10:59,735 --> 02:11:02,682
You don't understand all that.

1942
02:11:02,871 --> 02:11:05,715
Daughter.

1943
02:11:05,908 --> 02:11:07,080
What happened?

1944
02:11:10,178 --> 02:11:12,886
- Daughter.
- What happened?

1945
02:11:13,081 --> 02:11:14,355
Leave me, Grandma.

1946
02:11:17,786 --> 02:11:18,856
Jesus.

1947
02:11:19,821 --> 02:11:21,027
Jesus.

1948
02:11:30,699 --> 02:11:31,973
Now she is alright.

1949
02:11:35,637 --> 02:11:36,637
Nothing to worry about.

1950
02:11:36,738 --> 02:11:37,944
You can go home today itself.

1951
02:11:47,816 --> 02:11:55,816
Central.

1952
02:12:03,398 --> 02:12:04,398
No.

1953
02:12:17,479 --> 02:12:19,015
This is the pain of repentance.

1954
02:12:19,548 --> 02:12:22,154
Jesus will make it alright soon.

1955
02:12:34,363 --> 02:12:35,433
Daddy called me.

1956
02:12:36,365 --> 02:12:37,485
He will come in the evening.

1957
02:13:06,995 --> 02:13:09,566
I'm taking both of them to Dubai.

1958
02:13:10,732 --> 02:13:12,541
Tomorrow, we are going to Ernakulam.

1959
02:13:15,137 --> 02:13:18,050
The visa will be ready in two days.

1960
02:13:20,742 --> 02:13:26,852
The children should come to know the value
of relationships in their childhood itself.

1961
02:13:27,049 --> 02:13:30,326
It's can't be done easily.

1962
02:13:30,686 --> 02:13:33,292
Both of them are staying here,

1963
02:13:33,488 --> 02:13:35,525
but they don't know there
grandpa and grandma.

1964
02:13:35,724 --> 02:13:39,001
So what happened?
They don't respect the elders.

1965
02:13:39,194 --> 02:13:42,175
They are not scared about
what they are doing.

1966
02:13:45,434 --> 02:13:47,846
No use of blaming the children.

1967
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:52,241
Their parents should have notice all that.

1968
02:13:56,378 --> 02:13:58,085
The children are very disappointed.

1969
02:13:59,347 --> 02:14:02,692
They are sad about whatever happened.

1970
02:14:03,452 --> 02:14:05,796
Father, when you see them again,

1971
02:14:05,987 --> 02:14:07,867
both of them would be turned
into nice children.

1972
02:14:09,925 --> 02:14:12,371
Not only them. Me, too.

1973
02:14:14,730 --> 02:14:22,547
Father. Father.
Don't hate me and my children.

1974
02:15:03,111 --> 02:15:04,111
Karipalli.

1975
02:15:16,525 --> 02:15:17,595
Hey, Karipalli.

1976
02:15:32,841 --> 02:15:36,186
Hey, Karipalli. Come down.

1977
02:15:36,978 --> 02:15:40,289
Hey, you thief. Come down.

1978
02:15:40,882 --> 02:15:42,293
Very nice.

1979
02:15:45,821 --> 02:15:49,291
Hey. Come down.

1980
02:15:49,524 --> 02:15:50,764
We will kill you today.

1981
02:15:50,959 --> 02:15:53,200
Hey, Unni. Go up there and bring him.

1982
02:15:53,862 --> 02:15:56,809
No. Don't come up here.

1983
02:16:01,937 --> 02:16:03,541
You will catch.. It's difficult.

1984
02:16:03,738 --> 02:16:05,458
If you want to catch me,
you'll have to fly.

1985
02:16:05,507 --> 02:16:07,214
Hey, fly. Fly and come.

1986
02:16:07,409 --> 02:16:10,481
Pick. Pick. Pick up the stones.
Hey, throw and make him fall.

1987
02:16:11,646 --> 02:16:15,492
I will come down. Don't throw the stones.
Don't throw those.

1988
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:20,499
Hey, come down, come down.

1989
02:16:20,689 --> 02:16:21,690
Hey come down.

1990
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:24,166
Omana, at least you don't throw.
Hey, come down.

1991
02:16:26,528 --> 02:16:27,666
Hey, come down.

1992
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,172
Hey. Hey. Police. Police.

1993
02:16:39,274 --> 02:16:40,274
Sir. There.

1994
02:16:42,210 --> 02:16:43,484
Very nice.

1995
02:16:43,678 --> 02:16:47,091
Hey, come down.
Sir, don't talk like this.

1996
02:16:47,282 --> 02:16:49,558
Let me see whether I can bring you down.

1997
02:16:49,751 --> 02:16:52,595
Hey, Joseph. Go and get the net.
Go fast.

1998
02:16:53,889 --> 02:16:58,099
Don't get the net.
I won'tjump. I'm scared.

1999
02:16:58,393 --> 02:17:00,553
Everybody, hold this.
I will come down by the ladder.

2000
02:17:00,695 --> 02:17:02,675
- Hey, jump.
- Sir, I'm scared.

2001
02:17:02,864 --> 02:17:04,475
Now everybody throw stones
and make him fall.

2002
02:17:04,499 --> 02:17:07,343
Don't throw stones.
Hey, throw stones.

2003
02:17:07,535 --> 02:17:09,708
Sir, don't.. Don't throw stones.
Hey, jump.

2004
02:17:10,472 --> 02:17:11,472
Hey, jump-

2005
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:14,045
This Sunandappan is saying it. Jump.

2006
02:17:14,242 --> 02:17:15,242
- Iwilljump.
- Then jump.

2007
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:20,621
I'm going to jump.
Don't throw pebbles. I'm coming.

2008
02:17:22,918 --> 02:17:26,388
Beat him up. Beat him up.

2009
02:17:26,588 --> 02:17:28,124
Don't beat me up.

2010
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:36,440
Anyway, it's good that you
have come down now.

2011
02:17:36,464 --> 02:17:39,308
Othenlvise you wouldn't have been be able
to see Karipalli for sometime.

2012
02:17:39,668 --> 02:17:43,081
We will hand him over to the excise
department after we handle him.

2013
02:17:43,405 --> 02:17:44,577
- Hey, Karipalli.
- Yes.

2014
02:17:44,773 --> 02:17:46,650
Show your face to Elsamma.

2015
02:17:47,509 --> 02:17:48,509
Hey, remove the net.

2016
02:17:54,149 --> 02:17:56,151
- Daughter Elsamma.
- Shut up.

2017
02:17:58,386 --> 02:18:00,388
You should give news in tomorrow's paper.
Okay.

2018
02:18:00,655 --> 02:18:05,729
SI Sunandappan has arrested Karipalli
Sugunan with the help of a brave operation.

2019
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:07,032
Okay-. Okav-

2020
02:18:07,696 --> 02:18:08,976
Everybody, get into the vehicle.

2021
02:18:22,644 --> 02:18:23,644
We are going.

2022
02:18:29,784 --> 02:18:32,196
Now I can forgive Jerry's mistakes.

2023
02:18:33,154 --> 02:18:35,464
Because I had made more
mistakes than him.

2024
02:18:36,925 --> 02:18:38,529
No one was there to guide us.

2025
02:18:39,627 --> 02:18:42,198
Daddy and mummy were living
in their own style.

2026
02:18:44,165 --> 02:18:46,702
I believed that I can buy
anything with money.

2027
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:48,168
I had bought things, too.

2028
02:18:48,937 --> 02:18:51,144
But there's something which
can't be bought.

2029
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:52,543
Elsamma has taught me that.

2030
02:18:54,776 --> 02:18:58,223
Now I'm apologizing for proposing
you out of my selfishness.

2031
02:18:59,681 --> 02:19:04,391
Give me and my sister the caring
which you give your sister.

2032
02:19:06,421 --> 02:19:10,733
Elsamma, will you please accompany me
in the rest of my life?

2033
02:19:12,193 --> 02:19:14,730
I like this Aby. Sherine, too.

2034
02:19:15,263 --> 02:19:17,334
Only good things will happen in your life.

2035
02:19:17,532 --> 02:19:21,639
These people, Paappan,
Dinamma, goats and hens.

2036
02:19:21,836 --> 02:19:23,076
This is my world.

2037
02:19:23,505 --> 02:19:26,179
A huge world is there in front of you.

2038
02:19:26,374 --> 02:19:29,844
There are a lot of girls out there
who are more beautiful than me.

2039
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:34,059
God will bring Aby's girl in front of you
when the time comes.

2040
02:19:34,249 --> 02:19:37,025
That time you marry her.

2041
02:19:43,625 --> 02:19:45,434
God bless you, my child.

2042
02:19:53,301 --> 02:20:01,301
Central.

2043
02:20:07,015 --> 02:20:09,518
Poor man. Now Aby really likes you, Sister.

2044
02:20:09,717 --> 02:20:11,060
Why can't you marry Aby, Sister?

2045
02:20:11,286 --> 02:20:14,460
An important thing in a girl's life
is not getting married.

2046
02:20:14,656 --> 02:20:16,397
It is to become independent.

2047
02:20:16,591 --> 02:20:19,902
Even if I don't get married,
I will get you married.

2048
02:20:20,261 --> 02:20:22,181
I will conduct your marriage
when the time comes.

2049
02:20:22,263 --> 02:20:23,263
Right, Mariamma?

2050
02:20:24,199 --> 02:20:25,199
Go and study.

2051
02:20:43,618 --> 02:20:49,159
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

2052
02:20:49,357 --> 02:20:54,431
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

2053
02:21:00,869 --> 02:21:03,714
Is it not enough that you have taken the
money which I made by selling milk?

2054
02:21:03,738 --> 02:21:05,818
I won't have money in my hands.
I won't give you any.

2055
02:21:06,107 --> 02:21:08,644
It's not for free, right?
I have allowed you to marry her.

2056
02:21:08,843 --> 02:21:10,123
Who are you to give the consent?

2057
02:21:10,211 --> 02:21:11,019
Who am I?

2058
02:21:11,212 --> 02:21:14,659
Hey, the parents don't make decisions
about their daughters' marriages.

2059
02:21:14,849 --> 02:21:16,624
We brokers do that.

2060
02:21:17,519 --> 02:21:18,596
If you don't give me the money,

2061
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:22,227
I will tell Elsamma that you're calling off
your marriage with her.

2062
02:21:22,423 --> 02:21:24,528
- Elsamma.
- Hey.

2063
02:21:27,562 --> 02:21:29,166
- Come here.
- We?

2064
02:21:29,364 --> 02:21:30,364
Yes.

2065
02:21:30,498 --> 02:21:31,498
Calling.

2066
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:34,639
Elsamma, because he told me, l..

2067
02:21:34,836 --> 02:21:36,372
Not me, Let me tell you. Enough.

2068
02:21:36,638 --> 02:21:38,675
I will give you the money today.
For what?

2069
02:21:38,873 --> 02:21:42,650
For not bringing a proposal
for both of us.

2070
02:21:42,844 --> 02:21:44,152
LS it?

2071
02:21:44,345 --> 02:21:45,489
Things have reached up to
that level, right?

2072
02:21:45,513 --> 02:21:47,754
Yes.

2073
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,720
Then don't wait any more.

2074
02:21:52,954 --> 02:21:54,729
Bless you.
