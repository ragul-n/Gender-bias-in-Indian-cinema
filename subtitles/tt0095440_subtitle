1
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,166
Not even one(a single) girl
has worn jewellery worth watching.

2
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:03,075
Where are you going this year
for vacation?

3
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,144
This year I'm planning to go to Ooty.
You must come too.

4
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,710
Let's sit.

5
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,061
I'm Rajesh. I'm a photographer.
A freelancer#

6
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,398
I wish to take your picture.

7
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,569
Not that it's a hobby. Photography
earns me my bread. You see...

8
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,407
Quick service. Delivery next day.

9
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,809
Sorry. I'm not interested.
- Let him take on. Kavita#

10
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,407
Kavita...?

11
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,542
At the sight of whom
my heart thinks up a poetry...

12
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,011
...her name can only be Kavita.
(Kavita - Poetry)

13
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:46,084
Believe me. I've shot many a girl.
But such a ravishing beauty...

14
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,087
...I've never seen.
- Can't say about your talent...

15
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,430
...but you sure have a way with words.

16
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,628
That's it.

17
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,440
Turn left. A little.

18
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,855
Great!

19
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:26,897
I ask you. Where's the girl's face?

20
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,096
How do you find the necklace. Sir?
- That’s not an answer.

21
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:37,943
Not the answer to my question either.
- Listen punk. You're my servant.

22
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:43,146
And I pay you 1500 every month.
- Jaichand. In the last 5 months...

23
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:49,148
...I've given you photographs of 15 girls
who had worn expensive jewellery.

24
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,481
And all those jewellery were stolen.
- What has that got to do with you?

25
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,819
Using the photographs I gave you.
You stole jewellery worth millions.

26
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,831
And what did you give me?
Only 1500 per month?

27
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:06,665
From now on I'll give you photographs.
You name the price. I'll steal.

28
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,505
The deal goes fifty-fifty.
- Wow! Trying to teach your boss. Eh?

29
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,941
Think it over. It’s fine if you accept
the deal. Else. There are many takers.

30
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,187
No hurry. I'll come to you the first
thing after stealing the necklace.

31
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,855
To strike the deal. Bye.

32
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,292
The swine wants to
strike a deal with me.

33
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:37,032
How dare he talks business with
a mean scrooge like me? Boys!

34
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:43,668
Follow him. I want the necklace
before he lays his hands on it.

35
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:49,537
Go. Snatch the necklace
and get it here. Go on.

36
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,258
Ma(Mother)#

37
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,036
Calm down. Ma(Mother)#

38
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,708
No Ma... Stop Ma(Mother)#

39
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,582
Ma. Don't! Calm down. Ma(Mother)#

40
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,083
Ma(Mother)# No! Easy. Ma(Mother).

41
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,930
Relax. Ma(Mother)#

42
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,272
Drink milk. Ma(Mother)#

43
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:10,088
Sister Laxmi. Your son Mahesh
is a son whom every parent seek for...

44
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:15,259
He is very obedient.
- It’s Gods grace. Priest.

45
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,135
Let’s go. Son.

46
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,297
Here you are. Return the balance.

47
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,167
What are you doing?

48
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,046
What's this? 10 bucks...?
I had given you Rs. 20.

49
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:35,080
Won't I take Rs. 10 for the flowers?
- Everyone sells it for 5 bucks.

50
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,323
I keep only genuine stuff.
The flowers are from Kashmir.

51
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,490
The sweets are from Bengal.
The incense sticks are from Bangalore.

52
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:47,663
And the coconuts from Kerala.
Genuine stuff cost more. Get it?

53
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,765
This is unfair.
- So try another shop tomorrow.

54
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,538
How about settling today's account?
- Want me to tell you?

55
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,909
Yes...

56
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,679
Oh no! Are you hurt. Son?

57
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,683
Want... More?

58
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,683
Forget it. Don't argue with him. These
days they even bully at God's doorstep.

59
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,114
God knows where the world
is heading to...

60
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,482
Right sir. You keep genuine stuff.

61
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,487
Come on. Son#

62
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,497
You mustn't argue with such bullies.
-	Get in. Ma(Mother)#
-	

63
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:32,741
Items of worship going(selling) for free.
Take it...

64
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,909
For free. Take it. No need to pay.

65
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,508
How dare you?

66
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,730
Mr. Ascetic. Everything
you keep is genuine.

67
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,301
Is this genuine too?

68
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,813
So he's the one who
sells genuine stuff?

69
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,486
So Ma(Mother) did call you up.
- She said you went to see a friend.

70
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,486
And I knew you'd get this one over.
Constable. Throw him in...

71
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:33,230
One minute. He extorts double
the money for selling genuine stuff.

72
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,364
You must know his real identity too.
- Does he have one?

73
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,470
Yes. His real name is Raghavan.
First rate smuggler and robber.

74
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,938
He is wanted by the police too.
Look there. Third on the second row.

75
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:57,351
Scum! I'm going to lock you up
for good.

76
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,159
I'm inspector Ramavtar. Get that?
Constable. Throw him in...

77
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,093
I appreciate your memory. Son.

78
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,535
That thief was packing everything.
- Yes.

79
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,196
His photograph is in my police station
but you are the one who recognised him.

80
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,372
Whether you recognise or I.
It’s one and the same. Daddy...

81
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,538
...The bottom line is...
"Medals for me".

82
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,212
For all the criminals you catch.
I get promoted.

83
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,475
I'm your doctor.
- Oh yes.

84
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,886
What are you saying. Daddy?
- It’s true. Son#

85
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,681
Ma(Mother) must be waiting. I'll leave now.
- Okay... have some tea. Son.

86
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:38,556
My son almost spared you.
Had I been there...

87
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,299
Greetings. Ms Kavita.
- Greetings#

88
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,137
I'm here before time
as I promised.

89
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:54,139
I've never shot someone
as beautiful as you before.

90
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,237
Check it out#

91
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,318
What say?

92
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,258
What’s this?

93
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:17,595
Some would turn into poets. Some
would go crazy. Some would turn atheists.

94
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,733
Just your picture
could stun anyone.

95
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:27,339
Great! So you're a poet too?
- I wasn't. You've made me one.

96
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,312
I was developing
your photographs last night.

97
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,949
When the images developed...
It illuminated the entire dark room.

98
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,521
My mind put to words the sea of
emotions that rose within my heart.

99
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,961
And my lips turned it into poetry.

100
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,963
With your help I can even sing it.

101
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,502
“Some would turn into poets”
some would go crazy...

102
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,703
...some would turn atheists”.

103
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:40,049
“Just your picture
could stun anyone”.

104
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:26,058
“Don't take offence
to a madman's words”.

105
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:35,068
“It’s daytime...”

106
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,072
...yet a moon shines bright”.

107
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:44,312
“Even the sight of you...

108
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,479
...could dispel misfortune”.

109
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,669
“Like a bough...

110
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,941
...your hips sway”.

111
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:51,575
“Like seasons...”

112
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,852
...the look in your eyes change”.

113
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:00,792
“Sometimes they are
as tender as a blossom”.

114
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,253
“Sometimes
they turn into arrows”.

115
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,007
“I swear...”

116
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,371
“you are exquisite”.

117
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,748
“Who cares for the hills...

118
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:06,213
...and blossoms?”

119
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,590
“Wherever you set foot...

120
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,797
...it’s paradise”

121
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:19,465
“Some would turn into poets”
some would go crazy...”

122
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,567
“some would turn atheists”.

123
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:31,675
“Just your picture
could stun anyone”.

124
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,339
Amazing. You even dance well.
- Not I. You are amazing...

125
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,284
God has bestowed upon you
such charisma.

126
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,621
Your mere touch could
make a lifeless statue dance.

127
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,780
Don't flatter me too much.
Else, I'll become vain.

128
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,585
So how much should I pay
for the photos?

129
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,858
You'll pay me?
What a thing to say! Ms Kavita...

130
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:26,998
...all that you have given me in such
a short span of time is invaluable...

131
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,301
Really?

132
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,109
Really#

133
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,882
Thief! Thief!

134
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,330
Thief! Get him!

135
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,666
Thieves! Get them!
- What happened?

136
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,729
Those thieves ran off with my necklace.
- Give me your car keys.

137
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,072
I'll catch them.
- No. Don't#

138
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:05,006
These muggers are dangerous.
Don't put your life in danger.

139
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,143
How funny. You lost your necklace.
And you're worried about my life?

140
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,939
Was it expensive?
- It cost about 250.000...

141
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:17,685
But I have enough jewellery.
Forget all about it. Please...

142
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:30,499
Bravo. My punks.
You have made me happy.

143
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,964
You stole the bone
from that swine Rajesh. I'm glad#

144
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:40,777
That swine wanted to strike
a deal with me. Bloody fool#

145
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,214
You are the one
who is a fool. Jaichand#

146
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,917
You...?
- You only taught your men to steal...

147
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,718
...not to tell the difference of
a genuine stuff from a fake.

148
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,053
This is the real necklace.
The one you got is a fake...

149
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,758
What’s the guarantee
that yours is the genuine one?

150
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,395
Check it#

151
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,908
Genuine?

152
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,145
It’s genuine.
- Want to buy?

153
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,209
Or should I find someone else?
- Wait a minute...

154
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,576
Take 20.000 as advance.
We'll fix the price later.

155
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:26,420
This 20.000 is for the earlier deals.
Now. Fix a price for this necklace.

156
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,026
I get it.
The cat has tasted blood.

157
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,523
Boys. Break his face.

158
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,304
Get him!

159
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,450
My glasses...?

160
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,619
Gotcha!

161
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,063
Get up! Smart Alec...

162
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:15,235
...if you try your tricks with me again.
I'll slit your throat. Dig that?

163
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,871
I get it.
- Get lost!

164
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,475
Your blade.

165
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:29,680
Son of a gun! He took the necklace away.
I won't spare him...

166
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,731
What’s up. Inspector?
- What timing. Sir#

167
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,500
I've arrested the
notorious criminal Raghavan. Sir#

168
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:50,497
Yes. He's the don from Parel.
He's wanted in several cases...

169
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,175
Yes sir. He used to sell things
of worship in an ascetic's disguise

170
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,877
But how could he elude my eyes?
I recognised him at once.

171
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,882
He even tried to attack me. I blocked
his punch. Pulled his beard off...

172
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,193
...and kicked his belly. He slumped
right there. Then I told him...

173
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,725
...remember son. I'm inspector Ramavtar.
Who am I? Tell me...

174
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,188
Well?

175
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,933
Sir. I told him I'm a disciple
of ACP Tandon...

176
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:25,538
...who has nabbed hardcore criminals
like the butchers Billa and Panja.

177
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,846
The court is supposed to decide on
their case tomorrow. Isn't it sir?

178
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,107
Right. All the witnesses and
evidences go against them.

179
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,955
And we believe both of them
will be sentenced to death...

180
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,853
Panja and Billa must not be sentenced.
The duo is our right hand. Brother#

181
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,222
We make profits in millions from them.
Besides, with their help only...

182
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,058
...we can win the election.
- Who's the judge on this case?

183
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,064
P. C. Agarwal...

184
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,270
Considering the evidences
and the arguments of both counsels...

185
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:32,599
...it is established that Billa
and Panja were present...

186
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,776
...where the six murders took place.

187
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,412
But not a single witness or evidence
was found...

188
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,280
...that could prove that the two of them
had a hand in any of the murders.

189
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,093
So the court gives Billa and Panja
the benefit of doubt...

190
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,432
...and exonerates them

191
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,441
Cheers to the release
of Billa and Panja.

192
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,638
How could this miracle happen?
These punks committed six murders...

193
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,781
...in public. How could
the court set them free?

194
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,322
Why is he laughing?
- All thanks to my brother...

195
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,990
...minister Mr. Parshuram.
Just one phone call from him...

196
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,262
...made the court forget
to dispense justice.

197
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,828
No man is yet born who can
stop my brother's monopoly.

198
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,355
Seth Jaichand. This world
is a slave to wealth...

199
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,028
Everything is up for sale.
You only need takers.

200
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,695
There's something
that's not up for sale...

201
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,804
The Substitute Court(Teesri Adalat)#

202
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,376
Run!
- Hold it!

203
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:19,274
No one moves!
I want only Billa and Panja.

204
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:24,918
Should someone interfere. He will be
responsible for his own death.

205
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,076
Stop there!

206
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:59,247
Bastards! Man is ignorant
of God's judgement.

207
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,352
Which is why man never stops
committing crimes.

208
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:07,322
And in the court where man gives
the verdict. He often commits mistakes.

209
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:13,627
So I hold an alternative court
to punish butchers like you...

210
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,097
No!

211
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,939
Death!

212
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,792
“The Substitute Court”.

213
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,224
The Substitute Court! He has
committed 21 murders till now.

214
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:18,831
And our department still has no idea
about his identity and whereabouts.

215
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,498
Whatever. Sir. He has been killing
only those criminals who have been...

216
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:26,310
...let off by the court due to
our own failures.

217
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,512
That doesn't mean we set him free.
One who takes the law and order...

218
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:34,340
...in his own hands is a criminal.
And it is our duty to arrest him.

219
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,517
We'll try our best to bring
The Substitute Court#

220
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,154
...to the court of law
at the soonest.

221
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,228
Greetings.
- How are you?

222
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,000
Greetings!

223
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,244
Balwant. You were supposed
to return in the evening.

224
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,585
Hope you delivered the goods safely?
- Check the challans#

225
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,922
It took only six hours and
forty five minutes for me to return.

226
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,259
Wonderful. You're amazing. There's
no other driver in our company...

227
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,594
...as fast and trustworthy as you are.

228
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:55,160
He ought to be rewarded. Brother.
- No sir. I want no rewards.

229
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,593
It’s enough that I earn two square
meals a day honestly.

230
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,202
Today... today is
our wedding anniversary!

231
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,609
My wife will be glad
to see me home early.

232
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,945
I see. Congratulations#

233
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,940
Hello.
- Hello. Where's my brother?

234
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,513
There he is.
- Jaswant#

235
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,444
Brother#

236
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,220
Bless you. Let’s go home.

237
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,061
Your sister-in-law is waiting.
- Go on. I got to go to the bazaar.

238
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,793
Listen... wear your new dress.
I have kept it on the bed.

239
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,138
I'm not wearing anything.

240
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,651
Where is he...?
- I'm here.

241
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,654
Let me go. You'll hurt the baby.
- No way. Darling!

242
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,657
He will be glad that
his father has touched him.

243
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,798
He'll want to become as strong as me.
Know what? He'll also know something...

244
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,800
...his father loves his mother dearly.
- What...? Jaswant might watch us.

245
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,609
Jaswant isn't coming today.
I have sent him out.

246
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:18,778
Today we're celebrating
our wedding anniversary!

247
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,417
Let me go. It hurts...

248
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:27,450
Oh. I forgot that my son has become
a speed-breaker...

249
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,622
Looks like twins.
- Get lost.

250
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:36,693
Where's the hurry to get lost?
Today is our wedding anniversary

251
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:42,529
I've got a small present
for my darling Sumati.

252
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,040
Put it on me. Please!

253
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,720
I must've really done some
good deeds in my last birth...

254
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,789
...for finding a husband like you
and a brother-in-law like Jaswant.

255
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:11,060
I pray. May I be blessed with such
good fortune in all lifetimes!

256
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,066
Sumati...

257
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:33,788
“With you
is my life beautiful”.

258
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,717
“With you
has my sweet dreams come true”.

259
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,428
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

260
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:46,097
“Never ever part from me”.

261
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,234
“With you
is my life beautiful”.

262
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,811
“With you
has my sweet dreams come true”.

263
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,737
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

264
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,108
“Never ever part”.

265
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:35,145
“I'm so fortunate.
I've found your love”.

266
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:43,150
“I'm so fortunate.
I've found your love”.

267
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:47,553
“What more do I seek?”

268
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,732
“I've found my love
and my world”.

269
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,604
“I've found my love
and my world”.

270
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,569
“What use is now
pearls and diamonds?”

271
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,744
“What use is now
gold and silver?”

272
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,378
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

273
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:11,888
“Never ever part”.

274
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:07,234
“You are the quintessence
of my very life”.

275
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:14,941
“You are the quintessence
of my very life”.

276
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:23,051
“Always let me stay close to you.
Like the flowers in your tresses”.

277
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:35,265
“Don't ever strew
thorns of memories in my heart”.

278
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,276
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

279
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,608
“Never ever part”.

280
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,348
“With you
is my life beautiful”.

281
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,681
“With you
has my sweet dream come true”.

282
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,514
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

283
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,860
“Never ever part from me”.

284
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,203
Jaswant is here!
- I don't care.

285
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,976
When did you arrive?
I was only cleaning her eyes.

286
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,316
Jaswant. Why have you
closed your eyes?

287
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:24,317
When did you arrive?
- When the two of you were...

288
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:29,982
Shall I take my hand off my eyes?
- Take it off. But remember!

289
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,798
Next time. Knock before you enter.
Else, I'll knock your bonnet off.

290
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:39,932
Brother! If you must raise your
hands. Raise them only to bless me!

291
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,465
My blessings always
go with you. Jaswant!

292
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:48,006
What have you bought?
- Saris and bangles for you.

293
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,870
And for my coming nephew.
I've got a toy.

294
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,047
Great.
- What have you got for your brother?

295
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:59,651
What would I get for him?
He is born to be a giver.

296
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,754
A father's love. A brother's
affection. A guru's teachings...

297
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,096
and a sister-in-law like a mother...
...he has given me everything

298
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,888
Enough. Silly boy.
You'll drive me to tears.

299
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,937
Hasn't Balwant arrived?

300
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,606
Hello. Sir.
- Jaswant. Where is Balwant?

301
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,641
I've replaced him.
- Why?

302
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,917
His wife is expecting. Could go into
labour anytime. So he hasn't come...

303
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,617
No problem. Go on...

304
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,057
Jaswant forgot to take
his driving licence.

305
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:42,058
What...? He forgot his licence?
Between Bombay and Nasik...

306
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,062
...there are countless check-posts.
He'll empty his pockets paying bribe.

307
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:50,498
Hold this. I'll go
and give it to him.

308
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,900
Careful!

309
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,407
Careful. It’s heavy.

310
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,221
Hurry up.
- Hurry up. Boy.

311
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,161
Son of a gun! What have you done?
Fill it up...

312
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,833
Hurry up! Bloody ass!

313
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,808
Jaswant. Deliver the boxes
safely in Nasik...

314
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,181
No boss. I won't do this sick task.

315
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,245
Are you mad?
- You were working for Rs. 700 per trip.

316
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,111
Be a good boy and rake in money.
- I'll pay you Rs. 2000 for one trip.

317
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,117
Apart from your salary.
- And if I'm caught...

318
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:46,794
I'll end up behind the bars. Well?
Look boss. We work hard for our bread.

319
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,260
For us. Dishonesty is a sin.
- Cut the crap!

320
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,902
Do what you are asked to. Else...
- Else. You'll kill me?

321
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,901
Right.
- I'm going to inform the police. Now#

322
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,609
Only when you stay alive...

323
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,475
Get him!

324
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,488
Hit him!

325
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,507
Brother#

326
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,512
My brother!

327
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,523
No my brother...

328
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:51,527
No Jaswant! I won't spare them!

329
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:58,695
Scoundrels! You can't escape me!
I won't spare you!

330
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,103
Brother!

331
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,212
No Jaswant. You will live.
Nothing will happen to you.

332
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:19,545
Nothing will happen to you.
Why did they do this to you?

333
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:26,558
Brother. The bosses asked me to
deliver their smuggled gold in Nasik.

334
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:32,268
I refused. When I told them,
I'm going to inform the police...

335
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,570
they stabbed me

336
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:42,345
I won't spare the dogs! I won't!
- No brother...

337
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:47,910
In a rage. Don't take a drastic step.
Spare a thought for sister-in-law...

338
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,586
Jaswant! No! No!

339
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,691
Inspector#

340
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:05,666
Look at him. Inspector.
- What happened to him?

341
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,602
Who is he?
- He's my little brother. Inspector...

342
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:14,268
He used to work for B. R Transports.
They are smugglers!

343
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,739
He saw through it. And told them
he'd inform the police.

344
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:24,020
So they killed him. Inspector.
Please arrest them. Hang them!

345
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,624
Constable. Lock this guy up!

346
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,889
What...? You will lock me up?
What for? Those men are the killers.

347
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,429
The corpse is right before you.
On what charges are you arresting me?

348
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:43,706
On charges of killing your brother.
- What rot. Inspector!

349
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,640
Would I kill my brother?
- Yes! Throw him in!

350
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,446
Sinners! Don't turn me
into a murderer!

351
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,317
Freeze! Else, I'll shoot you.
- This is atrocity!

352
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:59,645
Lock him up!
- This is injustice. Inspector!

353
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:04,650
How could you do this injustice
to us poor. Inspector?

354
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:15,965
So it’s you! I won't spare you!
Never!

355
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:21,005
Oh! No use yelling. Balwant#

356
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:26,076
Know why you murdered your brother?
- Because you found out that...

357
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,887
your brother had illicit relationship
with your wife...

358
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,348
Son of a bitch! Bloody dog!

359
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,023
I will throw your cut-off bones to dogs.
I won't spare the two of you!

360
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,829
Infuriated. You killed your brother.
- No!

361
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,060
This is not true.
It’s untrue!

362
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,095
Yes. It’s untrue.

363
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,906
To turn it into a truth. The two
of you will have to do something.

364
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:55,704
Set his house on fire. It’s imperative
that his wife burns to death.

365
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:01,948
No! Should anyone touch my wife.
Then I swear...

366
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:06,719
I'll feed your bones to dogs.
I'm not sparing you.

367
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:11,484
And then a case will be recorded that
his wife killed herself out of shame.

368
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,431
Go on. Do it.
I'll handle the rest...

369
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,429
Send the corpse for an autopsy.
- Right. Sir#

370
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:27,541
Dogs! I swear. I won't spare you!
Let me out!

371
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,338
We're doomed. Madam.
- What happened?

372
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,947
Police arrested your husband.
- What...? What for?

373
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,082
For killing Jaswant.
- No#

374
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,456
Never! It can never be!

375
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:46,160
It has already happened.
- And the entire city knows.

376
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,564
Who are you?
- Angels of Death for you...

377
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,094
Get them!

378
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,775
Open the door!

379
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,104
Open the door!

380
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:10,786
Why have you shut the door?
- Help! Anybody there?

381
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,122
Torch it!

382
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:16,789
God! What am I to do?
- Somebody help!

383
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,853
Anybody there? Lord#

384
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,485
It’s imperative that his wife
burns to death...

385
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,821
No!

386
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,309
Good morning. Constable.
How is that murderer doing?

387
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,845
He roared all night like a lion.
Rein him in. Here are the keys.

388
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,846
I'll handle him.

389
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,850
Hey! Where are you?

390
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,895
Sumati#

391
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,921
Bastards# Come out!

392
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,260
Get him!

393
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:52,649
My gun...?

394
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:48,325
Sumati. I had spun so many dreams.

395
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:53,233
Oh! How I dreamt a life with you.
With our children...

396
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,766
...with my little brother Jaswant.

397
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:02,077
But, those monsters
set fire to my dreams...

398
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,079
They ruined our happy family.

399
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:15,420
People ignore such calamities in the
name of destiny. And live like zombies.

400
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:24,097
I'm dead. Yet I live.
You know why?

401
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:31,301
To punish those who con the law
and roam scot-free...

402
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,778
No sinners will ever live
on this earth anymore!

403
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:43,780
Because from now on I'll hold court.
The Substitute Court! I will punish them...

404
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:59,124
How long has she been in this state?
- Ever since I was a ten-year old.

405
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:04,537
I've always seen her lie in silence.
When she hears some disturbing noise...

406
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,876
she gets agitated.
- In such cases...

407
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,145
some untoward incidents of the past
leaves an effect on the mind.

408
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:17,142
Has she faced such a situation?
- Not that I know of.

409
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,857
She can only be cured in America.
- In America?

410
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:28,162
Yes. Such cases have been cured there.
But, it'd prove you costly.

411
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,158
I can even sell myself
to get my Ma(Mother) cured.

412
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:37,701
You need at least a million.
If you organise then let me know...

413
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,171
I'll leave.

414
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,976
One million...? How will
I organise that amount?

415
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,246
Where do I get so much of money from?

416
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,187
Ranavir. Has the stuff been delivered?
- The truck will reach at noon.

417
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:10,202
Daddy# Maruti has introduced
a new model. I want that car.

418
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:15,810
That department belongs to your uncle.
- And your uncle won't refuse you.

419
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,214
You'll get the car within a week.

420
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,883
Hi Sunita. How are you?
- I'm fine.

421
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,323
Come dear. Sit.
- Sit and have breakfast with us.

422
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,453
Well you fool. Where were you
all this week? Why didn't you come?

423
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:40,326
You could’ve come to see me at my
clinic. Couldn't you? Right. Uncle?

424
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,400
I'm not interfering between friends

425
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,467
Sunita. How is your clinic doing?
- Very well. Uncle.

426
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,905
Looks like the number of patients
with a mental disease is on the rise.

427
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:56,241
I'm afraid. Treating your patients
might drive you insane someday...

428
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,858
Get on with the conversation. Bye.
- Well brother...

429
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:06,058
Daddy has called me over. I wanted
to tell you this before leaving.

430
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,398
Else. You'll chew my brains later.
- When are you leaving?

431
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,933
I don't want to marry. Daddy...

432
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:15,601
What are you talking. Dear? Your
late mother had fixed your wedding...

433
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,600
...when you were a little girl.
Which is why I have called them over.

434
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:24,944
Our son is handsome and educated.
Before saying no...

435
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:30,275
...take a look at his picture once.
- No use. I'm not marrying him.

436
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,288
You hear that. Karamvir? Make her
see reasons. She listens to you.

437
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,757
I don't why you refuse
to marry him. Sunita#

438
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,959
Wedding gives one a reason to live.
Life-partner. Marital bliss…

439
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,861
...children...
isn't all that a necessity?

440
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,775
How bookish! I'm a psychiatrist.
Hundreds of patients come to me.

441
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:59,639
Mostly. Married women. D'you know
the main cause of their sickness?

442
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,781
Their husbands. After wedding. These
men take their wives for play-things...

443
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:08,955
...for slaves. Moreover. A machine
for producing babies.

444
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,328
Despite knowing it all...
Why must I invite trouble for myself?

445
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:18,126
Maybe few men are like that.
But there are some men...

446
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,833
...who adore their wives
till their last breath.

447
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:27,742
I haven't seen even one of that kind.
Please Uncle. My decision is final.

448
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,079
I got to go to the clinic.
I'll leave now.

449
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,583
I just can't reason
with the silly girl.

450
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:45,661
Children make their family proud.
But, this fool is bent on ruining it.

451
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:49,031
Looks like in trying to
make her a doctor...

452
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,697
...you forgot to teach her
familial responsibilities.

453
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:57,372
You are right. I have
treated her like a son...

454
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:02,174
Had her mother been alive.
Things would’ve been different.

455
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:07,943
Not to worry. As a woman.
I can understand her apprehensions.

456
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:11,717
Your daughter will certainly become
my daughter-in-law. That’s a promise.

457
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,407
Is she nice?

458
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,544
Ma(Mother)# Who kept this picture here?

459
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:41,083
Son. No need to be nervous.
Even if you don't like her...

460
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:45,410
...we've already chosen her. And we want
to make her our daughter-in-law. Yes?

461
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,086
Right.
- There you are.

462
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,984
So what's the problem?
- She doesn't want to marry. Son.

463
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,726
You got to make her marry you.
- Per force?

464
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:58,091
That’s right.
- She might have chosen someone else...

465
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:02,097
No son. I'll tell you
what she ails from.

466
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,441
And you must cure her...

467
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:13,245
Buy these medicines. You'll have to
come to the clinic once every week.

468
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:16,814
I'm sure I'll cure you completely
within three months.

469
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,654
Thank you. Doctor.

470
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,265
Sit.

471
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,645
Your name?
- Mahesh#

472
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:47,274
Mahesh#. What’s your problem?

473
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,643
Two years back,
I fell in love with Maya.

474
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,490
I was a painter then...

475
00:54:56,526 --> 00:55:02,158
After meeting Maya.
My brush could paint nothing but Maya.

476
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:06,161
I see.
- I could see nothing but Maya.

477
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:12,839
After six months. We married.
Maya! Maya! All day. All night...

478
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:16,110
...every moment...
Maya became my very life...

479
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:23,844
But perhaps destiny
disliked the love between us.

480
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:30,119
Three months back
Maya passed away...

481
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,533
Even a fortnight after her death
I was unconscious.

482
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:43,337
The doctors revived me but
couldn't help me forget Maya.

483
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:50,708
Whenever I see a girl who looks
even a little like Maya...

484
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:57,542
I feel like holding her tight
in my arms.

485
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:04,215
Doctor. Just day before yesterday
when I was at my friends house...

486
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:08,997
...his washerwoman came with the clothes.
She looked like Maya to me.

487
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,858
And I hugged her. Luckily the
washerman was standing outside.

488
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,769
By the way. I've been
thrashed several times.

489
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,673
After enduring such humiliations.
I don't feel like carrying on. Doctor...

490
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:25,145
But I had promised Maya
that I'll never kill myself.

491
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:30,575
Now you tell me. How can
I carry on like this. Doctor?

492
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:36,383
You will live.
I'll cure you completely.

493
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,392
Really. Doctor?
- Really...

494
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,097
Why are you staring at me?

495
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:59,604
Same eyes. Same tresses.
Same lips... Maya#

496
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,409
My Maya! Where have you been. Maya?

497
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,815
You're back. Maya#
- Leave me!

498
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,181
Don't! Leave, leave me alone. Maya#
- Let me go!

499
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,497
Not Maya. I'm the doctor.

500
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,901
You're the doctor.
I'm the patient.

501
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:27,166
See doctor? This is what always
happens to me. Oh. What am I to do?

502
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:31,169
Poor chap.
He loves his wife so dearly.

503
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:40,084
Yes doctor?
- I've understood your disease.

504
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,425
I'll treat you.
- Really. Doctor?

505
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:46,353
Yes. But you will have to do
exactly what I tell you to.

506
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:51,460
Tell me. What am I to do?
- Firstly. Get your face fixed.

507
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,099
Sure. Done.

508
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,183
Have you ordered something?
- No.

509
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,387
What’s the matter?
You look worried.

510
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,351
Can't help it. Kavita.
I want to participate...

511
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,162
...in the International photography
competition.

512
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,433
But I'm finding it hard
to choose a model.

513
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:31,264
You're worried for such a trifle thing?
Am I not worthy of it?

514
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,710
You...?
- Yes. I can model for you.

515
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,175
What are you saying. Kavita?
You belong to an affluent family.

516
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,381
No. You won't be a model.
- So what?

517
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:46,120
I'm not making it a profession.
I'll be doing it only for your sake...

518
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:50,323
But listen to me. Kavita...
- Nothing. I'm your model. That’s it...

519
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,729
Tell me. What look
are you going to give me?

520
00:58:55,765 --> 00:59:01,795
I think the combination of a woman
and jewellery is a breathtaking sight.

521
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,409
Come home with me. I have
all kind of ornaments.

522
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:10,302
You can take my pictures
with any of them.

523
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:14,875
Shall we...?
- Sure.

524
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:21,382
Wow! Lovely jewellery.
It could bedazzle anyone...

525
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:25,625
Tell me. What do I put on?
- Any one.

526
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:27,986
You'll make all of them look good.

527
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,935
This one?
- Go on.

528
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,108
Fine?

529
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:53,079
Superb! Looks like a celestial beauty
has come down adorned in stars.

530
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,586
Really?
- Honestly...

531
00:59:56,059 --> 01:00:00,462
God made you for the angels. It was
his mistake that he sent you on earth...

532
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:05,061
No man is destined to find in
such a beautiful woman.

533
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:11,537
Rajesh. Your words are doing
something to me.

534
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,444
Go on. Do your work.

535
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,811
A little to the left...
That’s it.

536
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:23,819
Chin up!

537
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,381
And the lips... open up a little.

538
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,885
“There is surely
something between us”.

539
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,686
“I wonder what it is”.

540
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:40,890
“Goodness! Don't ever mention it.
It is...

541
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,658
...much maligned”.

542
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:31,942
“Cast me away.
Or accept me”.

543
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,279
“Tell me what’s in your heart”.

544
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:40,547
“I can't bring it to my lips”.

545
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,949
“Look into my eyes
you'll find how much I love you”.

546
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,964
“The love you have for me.
Even your silence...”

547
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,161
...reveals”.

548
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:57,297
“There is surely
something between us”.

549
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:01,976
“I wonder what it is”.

550
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:32,571
“All that I have to say is that...”

551
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,341
...no one can stop me from loving you”.

552
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:40,747
“Don't look at me
with suspicion...”

553
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:45,019
“I'm your lover. Not a thief”.

554
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:50,019
“But I charge you
with robbing...”

555
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,387
...my sleep”.

556
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,627
“There is surely
something between us”.

557
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,368
“I wonder what it is”.

558
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,524
“Promise me...

559
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:33,059
...that you will love me
all day. All night”.

560
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:37,304
“Care for this heart of mine...

561
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,867
...and tell me what’s in your heart”.

562
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:47,078
“I want to love you.
I have nothing else...

563
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,952
...to do”

564
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,083
“There is surely
something between us”.

565
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,892
“I wonder what it is”.

566
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:04,491
“Goodness! Don't ever mention it.
It is...”

567
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,093
...much maligned”.

568
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,149
Hey! Who are you?

569
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,885
I'm her friend.

570
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,822
My name...
- You're here to steal. Aren't you?

571
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,384
No!

572
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,952
Thief! Catch him!

573
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:35,385
It’s a splint made of steel.
One kick will break your face...

574
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:04,952
My hand is made of iron.
One punch on your face...

575
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,804
Kavita. My child!

576
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:38,013
What happened? Look at me.

577
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,579
What happened to you?

578
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,352
Who was that guy? Who let him in?
Do you know him?

579
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,761
Tell me.
- Why are you quiet? Speak up!

580
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:55,270
Why did you get
all your jewellery outside?

581
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:04,678
Thank God we arrived in time. Else
he'd have vanished with everything...

582
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,059
Fraud! Traitor! Thief!

583
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:25,457
You have conned me.
You have played with my sentiments.

584
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,666
Kavita. Listen...
- Shut up! I'm not sparing you.

585
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,098
I'll scratch your face!
I'll kill you!

586
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:36,110
Kavita. Listen to me. Please!

587
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,049
Ma(Mother)#

588
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,318
No Ma(Mother)#

589
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,327
Ma(Mother)# Don't!

590
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:35,030
That’s my Ma(Mother). For the last 15 years
she's alive only for namesake...

591
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:40,705
She has forgotten her past.
She doesn't even recognise anyone.

592
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,045
Loud noise
almost drives her mad.

593
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,379
Her treatment can be done
only in America...

594
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:55,387
For which I badly need one million.
So, I tried to rob your jewellery.

595
01:09:57,426 --> 01:10:01,522
I'm not a thief.
Nor is thieving my profession.

596
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:07,669
I just want my Ma(Mother) cured.
The greatest desire in my life...

597
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:13,197
...is to see my Ma(Mother) recognise me
and to hear her say” My son”.

598
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:21,107
For which. I will do anything.
Steal. Rob. And even kill...

599
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:30,420
I know I have done you wrong.
Punish me as you will and can...

600
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:35,590
But, I'm not the least
ashamed of what I've done...

601
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:42,433
No deed is greater than the deed of
serving one's mother. And I know that.

602
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,440
Because I've lost my Ma(Mother)#

603
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:52,436
Until now I used to like you.
I loved you.

604
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,547
But from now on
I shall worship you...

605
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,459
A few such cases have been cured
in America...

606
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,719
But not every man can
bear the expenses.

607
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,627
This time I must take advantage
of Daddy's experience.

608
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,470
He's away. I'll talk to him
once he arrives.

609
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,040
But, what makes you take
so much interest in this case?

610
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,278
I'm in love with her son Rajesh.

611
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,215
How could you get into this mess?

612
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,882
Come in Mahesh.

613
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,490
Okay Sunita. I'll leave now.

614
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:40,161
I'll come later. I disturbed you.
- Oh no. Nothing of that sort...

615
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:44,158
This is my friend Kavita.
And that’s my patient Mahesh.

616
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:08,518
Scoot. Kavita. Else this one is going
to take you for his wife and hug you.

617
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:09,858
What...?

618
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,323
I must leave. Sunita# Bye#
- One minute.

619
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:20,927
Doctor. She reminds me of my sister...

620
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,204
You have a sister. Too?
- No. But had I one...

621
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:27,770
she would’ve looked like her.
My heart says so. Hello sister!

622
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,709
Bye Sunita!

623
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,198
Go!

624
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,572
I'm your doctor.

625
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,568
You're doctor. I'm patient.

626
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,039
Never mind. Come here.

627
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,045
I'm Shambhu. A police informer.
I was the one who informed you...

628
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:18,018
...about Billa and Panja.
- I know. What’s the matter?

629
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,022
I think they've found out
that I'm an informer.

630
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:25,299
Their men are all over my place.
I'm afraid they may kill me.

631
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:27,692
Don't worry.
I'll be right there.

632
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:38,373
So you were calling the police. Eh?
Now how will the police harm me?

633
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:43,274
No Mr. Bahadur. I was only...
- Bastard! How dare you...

634
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,813
...reveal our secrets to the police?

635
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,291
Snitcher! You think
you will escape me?

636
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:55,128
No Mr. Bahadur. I never snitched!
Don't...

637
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:05,335
Freeze. Bahadur! If you move.
I'll riddle you with bullets!

638
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:23,657
Inspector Narayan.
It wasn't wise of you to arrest me.

639
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,896
Cut the crap. Else, I'll whack you
hard enough to seal your lips...

640
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:34,664
You barely earn enough to sustain.
How dare you threaten me?

641
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,305
You can't imagine how costly
this hostility will prove you.

642
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,676
What will you do? You will ask
your brother minister Parshuram...

643
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:46,845
...to take action against me.
- You'll weep blood for the things...

644
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:52,051
...that’s going to happen to you even
before my brother does that to you.

645
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,865
Come what may.
I'm not letting him off...

646
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:09,063
I've got the bail orders for Bahadur
Singh and his friends.

647
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:11,872
Show him. Lawyer.
Take a look. Inspector#

648
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,044
Release them.

649
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,711
Come my dear Bahadur!

650
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:26,720
I tell you. Don't be furious.
Get out of here...

651
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:30,058
...before he locks you up again
and gets the bail order revoked.

652
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:38,729
What...? She isn't at your place too?
I don't know where she has gone.

653
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,531
It’s okay. Dear.

654
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,106
I was waiting only for you.
- Why?

655
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:52,174
Sheila hasn't returned as yet.
- So what’s there to worry about?

656
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,516
She must’ve gone to her friend.
She should be back in a while.

657
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:59,482
I phoned all her friends. They say
they didn't see her after the recess.

658
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,915
Must’ve gone to watch a movie.
You're worked up for no reasons...

659
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,551
You're worried.
And you make me worried me too.

660
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:14,296
Sheila! My child!

661
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:18,772
What happened to you. My child?

662
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:22,777
No!

663
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,482
How could this happen
to you. My baby?

664
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,778
What has happened to you. My baby?

665
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:44,097
Autopsy report says your daughter
was murdered around 3pm.

666
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:49,131
And Bahadur was bailed out at 5pm.
- I agree. Sir.

667
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:53,474
But, people like Bahadur have
enough men who carry out their orders.

668
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,811
Please issue a warrant
to arrest Bahadur. Sir#

669
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:03,484
How can I issue a warrant for
his arrest without any evidence?

670
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:06,446
Not even at the request of
a responsible officer? Yesterday...

671
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,187
...he threatened me right inside
the police station.

672
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:14,825
Has my statement no value? If not.
Then being a policeman is meaningless!

673
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:19,500
For an officer who risks his life to
arrest a hood. All he is rewarded...

674
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:25,465
...instead of medals is with his
daughter's corpse drenched in blood!

675
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:29,503
If this is what this job offers.
Then who will perform his duties?

676
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:33,177
Who will protect citizens?
Who will dispense justice?

677
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,614
Justice will be done to you...

678
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:49,863
The Substitute Court...?
- Yes. It’s me.

679
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:54,858
I'm here to sentence you.
To death!

680
01:17:55,270 --> 01:18:00,230
I'm not afraid of death.
It doesn't befit a true man...

681
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,975
...to point a sten-gun at someone
and hit him.

682
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:08,945
To get someone's daughter killed by
hired men... is that being true man enough?

683
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:13,879
Who are you talking about?
- About inspector Narayan's daughter.

684
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:20,157
Can you prove that I got her killed?
- Only the Court of Law needs proof.

685
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:24,695
The Substitute Court
only delivers justice!

686
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:27,902
Let’s see how true a man you are...

687
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,236
He's dead!

688
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,104
“The Substitute Court”#

689
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:26,077
Long live The Substitute Court!

690
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:31,548
Who is this Substitute Court? What
actions have you taken to arrest him?

691
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:36,330
I'll report about you in the capital.
He used to commit meaningless murders.

692
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:39,825
But today he has killed my brother.
Minister Parshuram's brother!

693
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,499
I'm a minister. My job is to
safeguard the interests of citizens.

694
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:46,773
What use is the police if it cannot
protect my family members?

695
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,202
The police is on high alert. Sir.
We'll arrest him very soon.

696
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:54,379
How soon? You have no idea
about his looks. His whereabouts...

697
01:20:55,851 --> 01:21:00,379
In the name of humanity.
In the name of justice...

698
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:04,714
I announce a reward of 500.000
on his head...

699
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:08,830
Sir#

700
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:18,999
The Substitute Court
murdered one Bahadur.

701
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,535
In which regard.
Minister Parshuram...

702
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:26,404
...has announced a reward of Rs. 500.000 to
the one who nabs 'The Substitute Court'

703
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:29,413
...Rs. 500.000

704
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:50,103
Did you read today's news?
- Yes. A reward of Rs. 500.000 on you.

705
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:58,411
Where justice is rendered helpless.
Where the long arms of the law...

706
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:02,681
cannot reach. There. Your law
delivers justice. Substitute Court#

707
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:07,249
We're proud of you.
- I'm grateful for you help. Mr. Tandon#

708
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:14,123
As long as I breathe,
I will hold court#

709
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,299
Why have you brought me here. Doctor?

710
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:31,811
Visiting beautiful places like this
will relieve your stress...

711
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:36,139
And your mind will find peace.
- So this too is a line of treatment?

712
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:39,146
Absolutely. Look what
I've got for you.

713
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,621
You're a painter. Aren't you?
So engross yourself in your passion...

714
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,291
...so much that your mind just
fails to think of anything else.

715
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,500
What happened. Mahesh?

716
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:01,835
Have I hurt you in any way?
- This is the place...

717
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:05,509
...where I met my wife
for the first time.

718
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:11,177
This is exactly where
I came for painting.

719
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:16,719
After I fixed the canvas. I turned
behind. And I saw her standing...

720
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:20,789
...right there.
I stood staring at her.

721
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:25,723
It seemed as if God had created
a live painting right before me.

722
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:29,194
I stepped towards to her.
She smiled.

723
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:35,676
I too smiled. When I told her
that I have fallen for her...

724
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:41,614
...she blushed...
and quietly she whispered.” Love me”.

725
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,879
I held her. Frantically.
Maya#

726
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:49,390
What are you doing? Mahesh#

727
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,230
You're doctor
and I'm patient.

728
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,593
Why does this happen to me?
I don't understand. What am I… I to do?

729
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:05,565
Never mind. Maybe I brought you to
the wrong place. Let’s go elsewhere.

730
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:06,974
Let’s go!

731
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:13,981
If you visit such lovely and serene
places. You will forget...

732
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:18,046
...the memories of the past.
And you will be completely cured.

733
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,682
What are you doing there?
Come here!

734
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:27,455
Why? Don't you like this place?

735
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:36,266
How can I dislike this place?
Here's where I first tasted elixir.

736
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:40,771
Elixir...?
- Exactly. There was lightning.

737
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,842
The breeze played havoc
on our bodies.

738
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:48,608
We became emotional.
Gave into each other...

739
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:52,616
And we made love for the first time...

740
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:56,388
My lips touched hers...

741
01:24:56,791 --> 01:25:00,852
The kiss still
lingers on my lips...

742
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:08,291
That kiss... Oh no. No!

743
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:15,298
What’s happening to you. Mahesh?
- I'm losing control over myself.

744
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:24,649
You look exactly like my wife.
My wife. My love...

745
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:29,312
I love you. I love you
more than anyone. Darling!

746
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:34,658
Love me. Make love to me like you
never did before. Kiss me. On the lips.

747
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:42,069
Let me go!

748
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:19,931
“Goodness. I've set out”.

749
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:27,374
“Oh indeed. Far ahead. My love”.

750
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:32,583
“Your romantic words...”

751
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:37,521
...have set my body on fire
in this rain”.

752
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:52,003
“Just a few meetings...”

753
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:58,743
...have aroused our passions
in this rain”.

754
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:53,024
“For you...

755
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:57,164
...my heart deserted me”.

756
01:27:57,639 --> 01:28:01,939
“As you touched...”

757
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:06,143
...my body blossomed”.

758
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:10,643
“There's magic in your touch”.

759
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:15,585
“The magic in your hands...

760
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:20,290
...has set fire on me
in this rain”.

761
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,863
“I did my heart's bidding”.

762
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:09,538
“I took your heart.
And gave you mine”.

763
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:14,214
“Oh. How will
these endless days...

764
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:18,541
...of love pass
without you?”

765
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:22,721
“And how will I cut
those endless nights?

766
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:27,894
“How do I cut
those endless nights...

767
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:32,164
...when the rains
set fire on me?”.

768
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:26,949
“We have made promises...

769
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:31,018
...and taken vows”.

770
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:35,887
“A few moments ago...
- We were strangers”.

771
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:40,030
“And now...
- We're lost...”

772
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:43,926
...in showers of passion”.

773
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:48,839
“Showers of passion...”

774
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:53,279
...set us on fire
in this rain”.

775
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:57,782
“Romantic words...”

776
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,254
...have set me...
-On fire...

777
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:03,651
...in this rain”.

778
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,993
Doctor. I'm a patient.

779
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:23,267
I'm Sunita here.
- What’s the matter. Sunita?

780
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:25,745
Why do you sound tense?

781
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:31,312
Uncle. I think
I have fallen in love.

782
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:36,946
Fallen in love...?
- With a married man...

783
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:40,888
What...? With a married man...?

784
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:46,765
Yes. Uncle. And I want to marry him.
You must talk to Daddy.

785
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:50,427
What are you talking. Sunita? Want to
marry someone who is already married?

786
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:55,265
Never! You will marry
the boy I choose. You get that?

787
01:31:55,676 --> 01:32:00,306
I'll marry only Mahesh. No one else.
- Who the hell is this Mahesh?

788
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:04,981
Where did you find him?
- He was my patient.

789
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:10,016
Great! And he made you sick.
His wife is dead. Daddy#

790
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:13,952
But he loves his wife so very dearly
that I can't even imagine...

791
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:16,829
And I remind him of his wife.

792
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:22,328
What...? Do you hear that. Karamvir?
She reminds him of his wife.

793
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:25,331
Should he find another girl tomorrow.
He'll find his wife in her too.

794
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:30,439
And he'll fall in love with her too.
- That'll never happen. I'm sure Daddy.

795
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:36,108
D'you have faith in his love. Sunita?
- Yes uncle.

796
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:42,811
You...?

797
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:51,259
Sunita. He's the one I had fixed
your wedding with...

798
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:56,198
And the poor chap is a bachelor...

799
01:32:56,737 --> 01:33:03,905
And he put in his best to successfully
bring you out of the shell.

800
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:10,512
So you folks have been
putting on a charade?

801
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,283
Doctor. I'm your patient.

802
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19,516
Sunita. Take the blessings
of your in-laws to-be...

803
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,023
Live long...

804
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:31,397
Such nerve!
You want to marry that thief. Eh?

805
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:36,067
He's not a thief. He needed money
for his mother's treatment.

806
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,411
There are countless poor men like him
around the world who need money.

807
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:43,113
But, it is not the job of the rich
to make good their shortcomings.

808
01:33:43,484 --> 01:33:48,148
We'll get you married into a family
where wealth will kiss your feet...

809
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:52,855
I don't desire wealth! I want love.
I want a life-partner of my choice.

810
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:57,022
Quiet. You don't know what’s good and
what’s bad for you. You're still a kid.

811
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:01,801
I'm major(adult) now. Lawfully, I have
the right to take my own decisions.

812
01:34:02,203 --> 01:34:04,433
Throw your tongue around
and I'll slap you again.

813
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:09,868
Hit me! Kill me! But I'll marry
only Rajesh. Only Rajesh!

814
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:19,280
I wonder what
has possessed this girl.

815
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,584
This is obsession. Brother.

816
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:27,027
And, there's only one way out...

817
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:39,397
Where is that doctor friend of yours?
- She should be here anytime

818
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:46,808
You're too much. Sunita.
Imagine what happens of a wedding...

819
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:50,150
...when a priest comes late.
The Registrar has been waiting...

820
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:54,818
It took time finding another witness.
He's the one. My fiancé. Mahesh#

821
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:59,985
Fiancé...?
Isn't he your patient?

822
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,488
Right sister. Her patient.

823
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:07,495
Meet him...
- I know. He's your patient...

824
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:09,335
Congratulations. Brother#

825
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:13,840
Come on. The Registrar is waiting.
- Let’s go...

826
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:18,511
Of you. Who are Rajesh and Kavita?
- We#

827
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:20,278
And witnesses?
- She and me.

828
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:22,912
How are you related?
- She's my cousin.

829
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:25,846
And he's my brother.

830
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:28,849
Sign here.

831
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,860
Come here to marry. Eh?

832
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:23,962
“In love. The hearts of lovers
soar like a bird”.

833
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:31,273
“And lovers unite”.

834
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:33,713
“Unite.
- Unite”.

835
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:42,208
“There's a promise on my lips.
I'll die but I'll never part with
you”.

836
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:47,187
“We've chosen the path of love”.

837
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:53,793
“Now that we've stepped upon
the path of love...

838
01:38:56,096 --> 01:39:00,760
...for us...

839
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:03,863
...there's no turning back”.

840
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:53,816
“This world is a sharp end
of the sword”.

841
01:39:54,254 --> 01:39:57,985
“It tears apart two loving hearts”.

842
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:02,325
“Between my love...

843
01:40:03,397 --> 01:40:06,423
and your youth...

844
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:15,608
...there stands an evil world”

845
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:35,152
“In love. The hearts of lovers
soar like a bird”.

846
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:42,902
“And lovers unite”.

847
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:03,183
An important announcement.
This is bandit Jwala Singh.

848
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:06,958
Having stolen diamonds worth 200
million from Jodhpur. He's absconding...

849
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:09,852
He is supposedly to be
on his way to Bombay.

850
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:16,396
25 years ago he was a police officer.
He was cashiered for his illegal ways.

851
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:22,367
He's wanted in connection with 10 cases
of murder and 15 cases of robbery.

852
01:41:27,381 --> 01:41:30,214
Inspector Amarnath!

853
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:44,827
Great Jwala.
You're just amazing.

854
01:41:45,265 --> 01:41:51,602
Wonderful. I've been selling diamonds
ever since I was born.

855
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:57,033
But never have I seen such beautiful
and priceless diamonds.

856
01:41:58,011 --> 01:42:01,242
Minister. I want to get out of
this country at the soonest

857
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:06,245
These diamonds are worth Rs. 200 million.
Give me 100 million for them.

858
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:11,490
Done Jwala. We'll organise both.
Money as well as your departure

859
01:42:12,092 --> 01:42:15,926
But you'll have to stay
underground for a couple of days

860
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:21,928
Your arrival has alerted the police.
- Minister. With you around...

861
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:27,262
...the law and the police won't harm him.
Mr. Bandit. As long...

862
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:32,772
...as you have his support. No swine
can even ouch you. You follow?

863
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:37,340
That’s fine. But if you dare
try any tricks with me...

864
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:42,678
I never betray. To my master. The
minister. I'm as faithful as a dog.

865
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:46,958
This city is where I do my business.
I don't want to spoil my relations...

866
01:42:47,327 --> 01:42:50,296
with the minister and get killed.
Right minister?

867
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,632
I have implicit trust on him. Jwala#

868
01:42:53,066 --> 01:42:56,297
I've organised food and drinks for
you. I'll come over tomorrow evening.

869
01:42:56,670 --> 01:43:03,633
Mr. Bandit. If you say I'll have
my men guard the guest house.

870
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:06,304
My three bodyguards are
as powerful as thirty men. Jaichand#

871
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,671
I know. I know.
- Let’s go. Jaichand#

872
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:12,314
Coming Mr. Diamond... I mean Minister.
Real big diamonds.

873
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:18,451
You drive while I sit.

874
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:26,999
My respects. Mr. Rajesh.
- Sethji? Here?

875
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:31,804
Of course. It is the thirsty one
who goes to well.

876
01:43:32,172 --> 01:43:33,332
Be seated.

877
01:43:36,176 --> 01:43:41,011
What is it. Sethji?
- When you proposed partnership...

878
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:46,614
I refused. You then
duped me of Rs. 20,000.

879
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:52,490
Now I come to you with the proposal.
- I have stopped thieving.

880
01:43:54,394 --> 01:44:01,357
Boy. If you don't thieve.
How will you get your mother cured?

881
01:44:02,135 --> 01:44:06,970
Boy. I keep tabs on the boys
who are useful to me.

882
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:13,175
You might've stopped stealing. But,
it’s not robbery if you swipe a booty.

883
01:44:14,047 --> 01:44:17,881
What are you trying to say. Seth?
- Have you heard of Jwala the bandit?

884
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,220
The one who stole diamonds
worth Rs. 200 million?

885
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:27,550
That’s the one. Get the diamonds
for me. And I'll pay you Rs. 20 million.

886
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:32,992
Give it a thought. All your needs
will be taken care of at one go.

887
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:37,392
What am I thinking of? I'll never
get such a golden opportunity...

888
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:43,734
You're right. Beating a thief at his
own game isn't thieving. It’s genius.

889
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:47,411
It’s a deal.
- Let’s embrace...

890
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:52,151
Gotcha!

891
01:44:53,153 --> 01:44:56,088
What are you saying. Daddy#
- It’s true. I have noted down...

892
01:44:56,456 --> 01:45:00,552
the number of the car Jwala used
to flee. The guys at the check-post...

893
01:45:00,927 --> 01:45:04,488
...inform me that Jwala's car
was spotted going towards Powai.

894
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:08,767
Now. That area is mostly occupied
by rich businessmen. So there is...

895
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:13,232
...only one place where Jwala can hide.
Minister Parshuram's guest house...

896
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:17,735
If you don't find Jwala there. Daddy.
The minister will have you cashiered.

897
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:21,103
That is precisely why I'm not
taking any official action. Son.

898
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:24,939
But you can personally give it a try.
Go ahead...

899
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:29,516
If you find Jwala there. Your father
will become a Commissioner overnight.

900
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:33,917
It’s like playing with fire. Daddy.
Yet. For the sake of your promotion...

901
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:39,129
...and to nab a scum like Jwala.
I'm willing to jump into this fire.

902
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:50,642
It’s me. Karamvir. Jwala is staying
at minister Parshuram's guest house.

903
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:00,145
Jwala is hiding in minister
Parshuram's guest house.

904
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:05,184
Have our men around the guest house.
So that they keep a watch on visitors.

905
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:07,527
We will reach later.

906
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:35,180
Jwala. The buyer will pay you
for the diamonds tomorrow evening.

907
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:40,117
Have you organised my getaway?
- Tomorrow night. A motorboat will...

908
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,327
...pick you up at Madh-Island. A ship
is waiting in the international waters.

909
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:48,532
You can go wherever you want.

910
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:05,017
Hats off to you. Minister. Your arms
are longer than the arms of the law.

911
01:47:05,385 --> 01:47:08,252
Not longer than the arms
of the Substitute Court.

912
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,220
Who are you?

913
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:19,122
The Substitute Court. I punish
the criminals who hoodwink the law.

914
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,092
As for you...

915
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:28,574
Remember me. Dog?

916
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:33,203
Balwant...? You?

917
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:41,384
Yes Amarnath. It’s me. Balwant.
You framed me for my brother's murder.

918
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:46,759
You ordered my wife
to be burnt alive.

919
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:51,088
You destroyed my happy family.

920
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:55,400
But today.
I spell death for you.

921
01:49:17,617 --> 01:49:19,676
Forgive me! Please!

922
01:49:22,122 --> 01:49:23,089
No!

923
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:36,395
No... No...

924
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:39,031
No Balwant...

925
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:04,120
The Substitute Court...?

926
01:51:13,633 --> 01:51:14,793
Freeze!

927
01:51:26,846 --> 01:51:29,474
Are you the Substitute Court?
- No buddy.

928
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:34,286
He killed the two of them and escaped.
- What are you doing here?

929
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:36,815
I...? I...

930
01:51:38,558 --> 01:51:42,050
So you're the Substitute Court's
sidekick. Assisting him. Weren't you?

931
01:51:42,429 --> 01:51:46,832
Oh no. I came for Jwala's diamonds.
- Diamonds? Where are they?

932
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:52,832
So you're here for the diamonds too?
Sorry friend. I'm not sharing.

933
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:56,000
Surrender.
And give me the diamonds.

934
01:51:56,676 --> 01:52:02,171
Look friend. Don't block my path.
Else. I won't care for the friendship.

935
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:04,640
Heed me quietly. Else...

936
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,849
All right. You want the diamonds.
Don't you? Take them.

937
01:53:31,871 --> 01:53:33,168
Quick...

938
01:53:36,876 --> 01:53:39,936
He's gone in the van.
Follow the van. Hurry up!

939
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:54,758
I knew you'd succeed. You're smart.
Give me the bag...

940
01:53:55,228 --> 01:53:57,753
Let me have it.
- After you give me my 20 million,

941
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:01,962
give my dear boy 20 million...

942
01:54:07,774 --> 01:54:09,469
Throw him out...

943
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:34,992
Open the door!
- I'm punctured!

944
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:41,365
So you're the buyer of the booty.
The famous Mr. Jaichand...

945
01:54:41,741 --> 01:54:44,574
I'm dead now.

946
01:54:45,578 --> 01:54:49,514
Please ask your men to
take that gun away from me.

947
01:54:49,983 --> 01:54:53,180
Give me the diamonds.
Else, I'll shoot.

948
01:54:53,586 --> 01:54:58,387
No! To be frank. All thieves
are cousins. How about sharing it?

949
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:01,021
We don't share food.

950
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:13,196
Diamonds... vanished?

951
01:55:14,073 --> 01:55:17,042
Where are the diamonds?
- Where are the diamonds? Speak!

952
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:24,840
Speak. Swine!
- Don't hit me. I swear. I don't know.

953
01:55:27,887 --> 01:55:31,755
Bloody Rajesh! He fooled us all.

954
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:36,061
Now think up what must be done.

955
01:55:53,313 --> 01:55:55,406
Mahesh...? What’s the matter?

956
01:55:56,115 --> 01:55:58,583
Where is Rajesh?
- He isn't home.

957
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:02,417
Then who is inside?
- Rajesh's mother...

958
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:08,589
But what is the matter?

959
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,896
Come... c'mon!
- What are you doing Mahesh?

960
01:56:17,403 --> 01:56:20,770
Sorry sister. I'm taking
Rajesh's mother with me.

961
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:24,803
When he comes. Ask him to get the
diamonds to the ruins near the hills.

962
01:56:25,178 --> 01:56:28,773
And he'll get his mother back.
- What're you talking? What diamonds?

963
01:56:29,148 --> 01:56:33,448
His mother is sick. She can neither
speak nor can she recognise anyone.

964
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,879
Should something happen to her.
Rajesh will not spare you.

965
01:56:36,255 --> 01:56:38,587
Get inside quietly.
- Don't do this. Mahesh#

966
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:42,621
Let’s see who spares whom.
- Open the door. Mahesh#

967
01:56:43,062 --> 01:56:44,461
Open the door. Mahesh#

968
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:49,327
Ma. Come here. Fast#

969
01:56:50,403 --> 01:56:52,371
What is it. Son?

970
01:56:52,872 --> 01:56:55,602
Who is she?
- She is unwell. Take care of her.

971
01:56:55,975 --> 01:56:57,943
I'll be right back.
- But son...

972
01:57:02,181 --> 01:57:05,014
She... she is Sumati!
- Yes. She is.

973
01:57:05,385 --> 01:57:09,583
Sumati. Where have you been
all these years? I'm Laxmi.

974
01:57:09,956 --> 01:57:13,551
Don't you recognise me?
What is the matter with you. Sumati?

975
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:16,161
Why don't you speak?

976
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:23,259
What’s wrong with her. Mahesh?
Where did you find her?

977
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:27,366
You folks know her?
- Yes son.

978
01:57:28,007 --> 01:57:34,310
It is because of this angel
that this family got a son.

979
01:57:35,081 --> 01:57:37,049
Son...? Which means...?

980
01:57:38,217 --> 01:57:41,186
Yes son. She's the one
who mothered you.

981
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:42,977
What...?

982
01:57:45,224 --> 01:57:48,193
Yes son. All we did
was to raise you.

983
01:57:48,694 --> 01:57:53,358
Before you were even born...
Her house was set fire by some hoods.

984
01:57:54,934 --> 01:57:58,370
To save herself from the fire.
She jumped off the window.

985
01:57:59,238 --> 01:58:01,331
However. The fire caught her dress.

986
01:58:03,009 --> 01:58:08,606
When nothing worked. She jumped
into the water to douse the fire.

987
01:58:10,316 --> 01:58:14,912
We found her unconscious
on the riverbank.

988
01:58:15,955 --> 01:58:17,923
She was pregnant...

989
01:58:18,825 --> 01:58:23,694
We took her to the hospital.
Where she delivered twins...

990
01:58:24,397 --> 01:58:28,561
Helpless and homeless as she was.
We brought them home.

991
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:33,932
My husband was informed that
her husband had left the city...

992
01:58:34,373 --> 01:58:37,365
The police suspected his existence.

993
01:58:39,178 --> 01:58:41,339
She was shattered...

994
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:45,680
Listen...
- Yes?

995
01:58:46,085 --> 01:58:48,815
I got an idea.
- Really?

996
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:53,923
We've been married for years now.
And the doctors too have ruled out...

997
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:58,252
the possibility of us having a baby.
It'll be tough for Sumati#

998
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:02,067
to raise the twins.
Why don't we adopt one?

999
01:59:02,468 --> 01:59:07,599
It'll relieve her a bit.
And we will have a son#

1000
01:59:08,107 --> 01:59:12,942
What are you talking. Laxmi?
She has run into bad times

1001
01:59:13,312 --> 01:59:17,078
She's helpless. For selfish reasons.
Do you wish to take advantage of it?

1002
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:20,851
I never said that.
- But you did mean that#

1003
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:24,551
Look. Mother's love is precious
than any thing in this world.

1004
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:27,686
A woman can abandon anything
but not her baby.

1005
01:59:28,094 --> 01:59:31,291
How could you even imagine
such trash? Go to bed now#

1006
01:59:48,114 --> 01:59:51,311
What happened to you. Dear?
Sumati...

1007
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:56,321
What happened?
- Wonder where she is...

1008
02:00:02,161 --> 02:00:06,029
Brother. Man needs support
to survive.

1009
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:08,993
My house has been burnt down. And
I don't know where my husband is...

1010
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:12,166
I was helpless. When you found me
by the riverbank.

1011
02:00:12,538 --> 02:00:16,338
If not for you. I'd have died without
giving birth to my babies...

1012
02:00:16,742 --> 02:00:19,711
Since you have called me a sister.
I have a request to make.

1013
02:00:20,079 --> 02:00:24,015
God has given me twins. Whereas
your wife cannot conceive.

1014
02:00:24,717 --> 02:00:28,016
On my own free will. I give one of
my babies to my sister-in-law Laxmi.

1015
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:30,582
Please consider it as a gift from
your sister and accept it.

1016
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:36,025
Should his mother be before him.
You won't get his undivided love.

1017
02:00:36,395 --> 02:00:39,853
So I'm leaving.
May God bless you with happiness#

1018
02:00:59,218 --> 02:01:02,915
Which means Rajesh
is my blood-brother.

1019
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:07,051
I'll be right back.

1020
02:01:26,312 --> 02:01:29,145
I'm here. Rajesh.
I'm here...

1021
02:01:30,249 --> 02:01:31,739
Open the door#

1022
02:01:35,354 --> 02:01:37,413
What’s the matter. Kavita?
Where is Ma(Mother)?

1023
02:01:38,157 --> 02:01:42,218
Mahesh locked me inside
and took your mother away.

1024
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:45,222
What...?
- Said. You'll get your mother back...

1025
02:01:45,598 --> 02:01:48,658
...after you deliver the diamonds
to him at the ruins near the hill.

1026
02:01:50,569 --> 02:01:56,166
Mahesh. By taking away my Ma(Mother),
you have invited your death.

1027
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:18,729
Swine! You kidnapped my mother.
I'm not sparing you!

1028
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:23,928
One minute. Rajesh,listen to me.

1029
02:02:26,572 --> 02:02:28,972
Tell me. Where is my Ma(Mother)?
- Rajesh. Listen to me...

1030
02:02:29,375 --> 02:02:30,342
Speak!

1031
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:34,911
Listen to me.
Hear me out. Rajesh#

1032
02:02:36,282 --> 02:02:37,476
Stop it!

1033
02:02:38,384 --> 02:02:41,785
Just listen to me once. My brother.
Then you can kill me if you want.

1034
02:02:42,254 --> 02:02:44,222
You don't know.
You and I are blood-brothers...

1035
02:02:44,523 --> 02:02:48,482
You're lying!
- Honestly. Brother. I swear by Ma(Mother).

1036
02:02:50,796 --> 02:02:53,856
Come home with me.
If you're not convinced...

1037
02:02:54,233 --> 02:02:56,667
...you can hit me before Ma(Mother).
To your heart’s content

1038
02:02:58,237 --> 02:02:59,204
Come...

1039
02:03:00,339 --> 02:03:01,306
Come in.

1040
02:03:05,244 --> 02:03:07,212
Ma(Mother)# Are you all right?

1041
02:03:11,317 --> 02:03:13,182
Ma(Mother)# That’s Rajesh.

1042
02:03:13,552 --> 02:03:18,512
Rajesh. They are my parents.
They raised me.

1043
02:03:23,562 --> 02:03:25,860
Ma(Mother)#. He can't believe
that we're blood-brothers...

1044
02:03:26,298 --> 02:03:30,701
It’s true. Son# Twenty years ago.
The two of you were born before us.

1045
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:36,667
We had no children. So your mother
gave us one of her babies.

1046
02:03:38,577 --> 02:03:39,874
It’s true. Rajesh#

1047
02:03:46,485 --> 02:03:48,282
My brother!
- Rajesh. My brother!

1048
02:03:53,659 --> 02:03:58,221
Find that swine Rajesh at any cost!
- My men will surely find him.

1049
02:03:58,597 --> 02:04:01,566
You must find him. The newspapers have
clearly mentioned that bandit Jwala...

1050
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:09,939
The police haven't found the diamonds.
Only we know that Rajesh has them.

1051
02:04:10,309 --> 02:04:15,144
Let’s kill Rajesh and share the
diamonds among ourselves. What say?

1052
02:04:15,614 --> 02:04:18,981
But that bastard needs to be found...

1053
02:04:28,694 --> 02:04:33,961
Why did you hide the camera here?
- I captured a priceless picture.

1054
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:37,166
The Substitute Court’s.
- What...? The Substitute Court’s?

1055
02:04:37,636 --> 02:04:42,198
Let’s develop it at once. I got
much to do with the Substitute Court.

1056
02:04:48,647 --> 02:04:49,705
Look.

1057
02:04:52,518 --> 02:04:56,614
Is he the Substitute Court?
- Yes.

1058
02:04:57,556 --> 02:05:00,616
Do you know him?
- He is Sunita's uncle.

1059
02:05:01,794 --> 02:05:06,629
So he has two identities.
I must turn him in to the law.

1060
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:10,294
Hello. Sir.
- Hello sir.

1061
02:05:20,446 --> 02:05:22,073
There he is...

1062
02:05:59,518 --> 02:06:01,349
Mahesh? You?

1063
02:06:02,488 --> 02:06:05,355
What’s all this?
- The law's firm grip.

1064
02:06:05,724 --> 02:06:08,852
No criminal has ever escaped it.
Substitute Court...

1065
02:06:09,495 --> 02:06:13,397
Substitute Court...? Are you crazy?
- You're crazy.

1066
02:06:13,832 --> 02:06:18,292
How mercilessly you play with blood!
And here's proof.

1067
02:06:20,539 --> 02:06:24,873
The owner of such a huge estate!
An angel in the eyes of the public!

1068
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:27,371
A murderer. A butcher!
When the truth outs...

1069
02:06:27,746 --> 02:06:32,843
...humanity will shed blood for tears.
- Of course. It will...

1070
02:06:33,986 --> 02:06:42,052
Not because I'm the Substitute Court.
But because two young morons...

1071
02:06:42,461 --> 02:06:46,921
...are about to destroy the
one who protects humanity.

1072
02:06:47,299 --> 02:06:50,735
No man can protect humanity
as does the law...

1073
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:54,403
And we're going to
turn you in to the law.

1074
02:06:54,773 --> 02:06:57,139
Don't you mention the law before me!

1075
02:06:58,577 --> 02:07:02,741
What did the law do when it held
Billa and Panja in its grip?

1076
02:07:03,482 --> 02:07:08,078
What was the law doing when inspector
Narayan's daughter was being murdered?

1077
02:07:09,555 --> 02:07:15,755
Inspector Amarnath locked me up
under false charges of murder.

1078
02:07:16,495 --> 02:07:25,164
He burnt down my house.
The fire killed my pregnant wife...

1079
02:07:25,704 --> 02:07:30,403
What was the law doing then?
I ask! Where was the law then?

1080
02:07:34,513 --> 02:07:40,782
I've vowed by my wife.
By my unborn baby...

1081
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:47,456
...to kill all those wolves who
take undue advantage of the law...

1082
02:07:47,826 --> 02:07:53,423
...until I breathe my last.
And in keeping my vow...

1083
02:07:53,832 --> 02:07:58,792
...let alone you kids.
No power on earth can stop me.

1084
02:07:59,571 --> 02:08:02,506
No-one can stop me.
Never!

1085
02:08:03,275 --> 02:08:08,235
I shall destroy every thing
that blocks my path!

1086
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:24,417
Not to be scared.

1087
02:09:26,024 --> 02:09:32,896
I won't kill you. Because I only shed
their blood who commit atrocities.

1088
02:09:33,932 --> 02:09:38,232
By killing you. I don't
want to burden my soul.

1089
02:09:53,652 --> 02:09:56,314
I know you have the negatives...

1090
02:09:56,955 --> 02:09:59,924
...which you can use
to drag me to court.

1091
02:10:00,959 --> 02:10:04,588
But I've learnt very well
how to play games with the law.

1092
02:10:05,731 --> 02:10:09,098
Like Billa and Panja.
I too will be let off...

1093
02:10:23,682 --> 02:10:26,344
Mahesh. There's so much truth
in what he said.

1094
02:10:26,718 --> 02:10:30,950
Rot! If everyone tries to create
problems for himself. Then the law...

1095
02:10:31,323 --> 02:10:35,623
...the government and the country will
hold no value. Nor will we need them.

1096
02:10:36,128 --> 02:10:39,291
I will drag the Substitute Court
to the Court of Law.

1097
02:10:39,998 --> 02:10:42,967
Let me see who can save him
from the capital punishment.

1098
02:11:02,187 --> 02:11:04,655
What is it. Daddy?
- I don't understand.

1099
02:11:05,023 --> 02:11:10,359
No wound. No pressure on the nerves.
Looks like she has suffered...

1100
02:11:10,729 --> 02:11:16,167
...a terrible emotional setback.
The brain is almost un-functional.

1101
02:11:27,045 --> 02:11:29,172
Sister Sumati...
what happened to you?

1102
02:11:48,066 --> 02:11:49,431
Sumati...?

1103
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:55,437
Sumati. You're alive!

1104
02:12:06,084 --> 02:12:09,053
What has happened to you. Sumati?

1105
02:12:12,557 --> 02:12:14,650
Sumati look... I'm Balwant.

1106
02:12:15,093 --> 02:12:18,187
Look at me.
I'm Balwant. Your husband.

1107
02:12:22,534 --> 02:12:26,595
Doctor. What is wrong with my wife?
- Is she your wife?

1108
02:12:27,105 --> 02:12:29,665
Yes. She's my wife...

1109
02:13:19,558 --> 02:13:23,324
“With you
is my life beautiful”.

1110
02:13:23,895 --> 02:13:27,695
“With you
has my sweet dream come true”.

1111
02:13:28,166 --> 02:13:31,624
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

1112
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:36,937
“Never ever part from me”.

1113
02:14:14,913 --> 02:14:18,508
“Every time I beckon you...

1114
02:14:19,518 --> 02:14:23,420
...you must come running to me”.

1115
02:14:28,894 --> 02:14:32,762
“You are the reason I smile”.

1116
02:14:33,231 --> 02:14:37,463
“Don't ever bring a tear to me”.

1117
02:14:42,707 --> 02:14:46,199
“For. I can only smile...”

1118
02:14:47,245 --> 02:14:50,544
“I have never known grief”.

1119
02:14:51,016 --> 02:14:54,713
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

1120
02:14:55,754 --> 02:14:59,815
“Never ever part”.

1121
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:45,966
“Your empty temple
of love...”

1122
02:15:46,872 --> 02:15:50,706
“I shall fill it with my heart”.

1123
02:15:56,214 --> 02:16:00,082
“Sit before me...”

1124
02:16:05,624 --> 02:16:09,287
“Let me sing our song
again for you”.

1125
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:22,003
“Let me remind you...

1126
02:16:22,841 --> 02:16:26,038
...of our sweet dreams”

1127
02:16:27,112 --> 02:16:30,309
“Let me remind you...

1128
02:16:31,349 --> 02:16:34,910
...of our sweet dreams”

1129
02:16:50,101 --> 02:16:51,068
Listen...

1130
02:16:52,237 --> 02:16:53,204
Listen.

1131
02:16:59,244 --> 02:17:01,144
Listen!

1132
02:17:16,728 --> 02:17:22,360
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

1133
02:17:27,839 --> 02:17:33,368
“Never ever part”.

1134
02:17:43,688 --> 02:17:47,180
“With you is my life beautiful”.

1135
02:17:47,559 --> 02:17:51,188
“With you
has my sweet dream come true”.

1136
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:55,031
“Don't ever be cross with me”.

1137
02:17:55,433 --> 02:17:59,733
“Never ever part from me”.

1138
02:18:06,311 --> 02:18:07,801
Sister Sumati...

1139
02:18:17,255 --> 02:18:21,419
Do you recognise me?
- Why not? You're Laxmi.

1140
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,424
And that’s brother Ramavtar.

1141
02:18:26,264 --> 02:18:29,233
How is your son?
- What a thing to say.

1142
02:18:29,601 --> 02:18:35,130
Not mine. He's our son.
He knows everything.

1143
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:38,441
The two brothers
have met each other too.

1144
02:18:38,877 --> 02:18:40,105
Really?

1145
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:47,079
Two brothers...?
- Yes. Rajesh and Mahesh are brothers.

1146
02:18:47,485 --> 02:18:49,453
They are twins.

1147
02:18:51,389 --> 02:18:55,155
And meet them. Your daughters-in-law
to-be. Kavita and Sunita.

1148
02:18:57,495 --> 02:19:00,191
Where are you sons?
Call them here.

1149
02:19:00,632 --> 02:19:06,195
The two of are out to nab a dangerous
criminal. The Substitute Court...

1150
02:19:13,244 --> 02:19:17,476
What are you thinking of? Our sons
have gone to nab a dangerous criminal.

1151
02:19:18,249 --> 02:19:22,913
God forbid. If something...
I'm scared. Bring my sons to me.

1152
02:19:23,288 --> 02:19:29,284
Don't be afraid. The Substitute Court
will not harm our sons, Sumati#.

1153
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:34,828
Here you are.
- Come on. Let’s take these photos...

1154
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:38,169
...to the Inspector General.
- Think it over. Brother#

1155
02:19:38,536 --> 02:19:41,198
Is it wise to take
the Substitute Court on?

1156
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:45,642
Why are you scared. Brother? Even
when I was alone. I was scared of none.

1157
02:19:46,144 --> 02:19:51,514
But now. I have my brother with me.
The two of us can take on the world.

1158
02:19:51,883 --> 02:19:52,850
Let’s go.

1159
02:20:05,263 --> 02:20:11,862
I'm glad to know that
you have a brother too.

1160
02:20:12,337 --> 02:20:15,795
What do you want?
- All I got to do with is money.

1161
02:20:16,374 --> 02:20:23,337
Look son. Give me the diamonds.
Else I'll bury the two of you alive.

1162
02:20:26,584 --> 02:20:29,212
You won't get the diamonds.
- Why not?

1163
02:20:29,721 --> 02:20:32,952
Because the diamonds are with
the Substitute Court.

1164
02:20:33,391 --> 02:20:36,690
Substitute Court...?
- Not convinced? Look at this picture.

1165
02:20:37,061 --> 02:20:39,052
He killed Jwala and decamped
with the diamonds.

1166
02:20:41,733 --> 02:20:44,099
He's our old driver. Balwant#

1167
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:50,965
Balwant...? I know him
as the rich man Karamvir.

1168
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:58,306
Karamvir...? Which means
he has three identities...

1169
02:20:59,317 --> 02:21:03,811
Last time he gave me a slipper
for diamonds. Don't trust this chap.

1170
02:21:04,622 --> 02:21:07,250
Whether he's lying or saying
the truth. We'll find out...

1171
02:21:07,625 --> 02:21:10,253
after we take them to our hangout.
As of now...

1172
02:21:10,628 --> 02:21:13,825
I must find a way out to
wipe the Substitute Court out

1173
02:21:14,365 --> 02:21:17,095
Take them away!
- Come on!

1174
02:21:18,436 --> 02:21:20,370
Substitute Court!
The son of a gun!

1175
02:21:21,739 --> 02:21:23,138
Son of a gun!

1176
02:21:23,508 --> 02:21:26,602
I'll kill you if you
touch him again!

1177
02:21:32,650 --> 02:21:36,950
Uncle. Both of them are not home.
- No...? Where could they have gone?

1178
02:21:37,722 --> 02:21:40,623
Go home. Uncle.
While we go and look for them...

1179
02:22:11,389 --> 02:22:15,223
Dr. Prakash. Who did all this?

1180
02:22:16,494 --> 02:22:20,658
Who was here?
- Some hoods came looking for you

1181
02:22:21,399 --> 02:22:25,358
When they didn't find you.
Though I tried to stop them...

1182
02:22:25,737 --> 02:22:31,334
They took your wife away.
- Hoods? Who were they?

1183
02:22:31,709 --> 02:22:34,473
I'll tell you. Substitute Court.

1184
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:41,678
Who the hell are you. Bastard?
- Easy! I'm just a messenger...

1185
02:22:42,053 --> 02:22:45,682
of Balbir and Ranavir.
Your old bosses...

1186
02:22:47,492 --> 02:22:51,895
What...?
Those dogs are still alive?

1187
02:22:52,463 --> 02:22:55,694
Dogs never die so easily.
Yes. They are alive.

1188
02:22:56,067 --> 02:23:01,334
I must tell you something.
They have your wife with them.

1189
02:23:01,739 --> 02:23:06,369
What are you raving? Where is
my wife? Bastard! Son of a bitch!

1190
02:23:06,744 --> 02:23:10,043
Tell me!
Or I'm going to kill you.

1191
02:23:10,481 --> 02:23:15,043
Why grab my neck? Take your hands off.
You will tear my pants.

1192
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:19,718
Not pants! I rip apart
the brains of men like you.

1193
02:23:20,091 --> 02:23:24,528
My brains? What use is it to you?
Calm down. And think.

1194
02:23:24,929 --> 02:23:29,389
If I fail to reach there
with your reply in two hours...

1195
02:23:29,767 --> 02:23:31,735
those dogs will kill your wife.

1196
02:23:34,639 --> 02:23:36,971
That taught him a lesson.

1197
02:23:40,511 --> 02:23:42,843
Tell me. For what
do you want a reply?

1198
02:23:44,782 --> 02:23:49,481
There you are. You had decamped
with Ranavir's and Balbir's gold.

1199
02:23:49,854 --> 02:23:54,416
Get that over to the GodhBunder fort
tomorrow at five.

1200
02:23:54,792 --> 02:23:58,228
There I'll tell you
where to go. And yes...

1201
02:23:58,596 --> 02:24:04,364
also get that bandit Jwala's diamonds
you pouched. You'll come. Won't you?

1202
02:24:04,802 --> 02:24:11,332
Son of a gun! I don't
have anybody's diamonds.

1203
02:24:11,809 --> 02:24:16,906
You don't have? But Rajesh and Mahesh
said the diamonds were with you.

1204
02:24:17,515 --> 02:24:22,782
Rajesh and Mahesh...? Where are they?
- In those wolves' custody.

1205
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:26,957
They said you got
those glittering diamonds.

1206
02:24:27,592 --> 02:24:33,428
I can't help it. You very well know
how avaricious Ranavir and Balbir are.

1207
02:24:33,831 --> 02:24:36,959
For gold and silver, the two of them
could even kill their mother.

1208
02:24:37,535 --> 02:24:42,529
If you don't reach there. I'm afraid
they might kill your wife.

1209
02:24:44,842 --> 02:24:45,809
Hit him!

1210
02:24:48,613 --> 02:24:50,911
Because of you my daughter defied me.

1211
02:24:51,849 --> 02:24:55,580
I'll give you a death
that would make even Death shudder.

1212
02:24:55,953 --> 02:25:00,447
Beware. The Substitute Court might
drop in any moment with the diamonds.

1213
02:25:00,858 --> 02:25:06,296
Don't worry about him. Jaichand.
His state is worse than a mouse's...

1214
02:25:06,664 --> 02:25:08,962
as long as we have his wife.

1215
02:25:10,435 --> 02:25:14,496
Heed me. Bring that old hag
and tie her up here.

1216
02:25:14,872 --> 02:25:19,172
The swine is quicker than tempest.
Only the fear of losing his wife...

1217
02:25:19,544 --> 02:25:24,447
can keep him under control.
The old hag is our shield. You dig?

1218
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:27,308
Get her here.
- Quick.

1219
02:25:27,618 --> 02:25:28,846
Let me go.

1220
02:25:30,621 --> 02:25:32,521
Let me go!

1221
02:25:33,891 --> 02:25:34,858
Ma(Mother)#

1222
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:36,627
Ma(Mother)#

1223
02:25:38,663 --> 02:25:40,528
Ma(Mother)# I'm Rajesh.

1224
02:25:41,766 --> 02:25:45,497
Don't you recognise me. Ma(Mother)?
I'm Rajesh.

1225
02:25:45,903 --> 02:25:48,872
And this is Mahesh. My blood-brother.
- Yes Ma.

1226
02:25:51,909 --> 02:25:54,400
Rajesh. Mahesh... my sons...

1227
02:25:54,912 --> 02:25:57,346
Let me go!
My babies...

1228
02:25:57,715 --> 02:26:00,377
Bastards! Let go of my Ma(Mother)#

1229
02:26:00,818 --> 02:26:02,410
Let my Ma(Mother) go!

1230
02:26:03,654 --> 02:26:07,385
Let me go. Let me go to my children.
Let me go.

1231
02:26:08,926 --> 02:26:11,588
Rajesh. My baby.

1232
02:26:14,332 --> 02:26:17,028
Mahesh. My darling.

1233
02:26:23,141 --> 02:26:27,009
Rajesh. What’s going on. Son?

1234
02:26:27,411 --> 02:26:31,905
Ma(Mother)# You've come around. Have you?
Do you recollect everything?

1235
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:36,418
Yes. Your father
reminded me everything.

1236
02:26:36,888 --> 02:26:37,980
My Father...?

1237
02:26:38,956 --> 02:26:44,394
Which means. The Substitute Court...
- Is your father's alias...

1238
02:26:45,730 --> 02:26:50,064
Whose real name is Balwant.
Am I right?

1239
02:26:57,642 --> 02:27:02,978
Aren't you the demons who set fire
to my house?

1240
02:27:03,614 --> 02:27:07,516
Absolutely. We're the ones
who killed your brother-in-law.

1241
02:27:07,885 --> 02:27:10,615
And we're the ones
who framed your husband.

1242
02:27:11,989 --> 02:27:17,621
Curs! You destroyed my family.
I'll have your blood!

1243
02:27:18,062 --> 02:27:19,256
Tie her up!

1244
02:27:19,997 --> 02:27:22,158
Don't you dare touch my Ma(Mother)#

1245
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:26,236
Hats off to you!
You're one up on me.

1246
02:27:26,604 --> 02:27:32,474
I thought we had only his wife. But, we
have both his sons too in our clutches.

1247
02:27:32,910 --> 02:27:37,210
And now. The Substitute Court
is going to come begging for them.

1248
02:28:39,543 --> 02:28:40,942
My sons!

1249
02:28:42,013 --> 02:28:45,744
Hold it! If you move.
I'll riddle the two of them.

1250
02:28:47,218 --> 02:28:50,654
What are you watching?
Save my sons. Please...

1251
02:28:51,455 --> 02:28:56,222
Dare you move.
Your sons will be dead.

1252
02:28:56,694 --> 02:29:00,255
Give me the gun! Swine!
- Stop staring and tie him up.

1253
02:29:00,731 --> 02:29:02,631
Tie up the Substitute Court!

1254
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,059
No! Let me go.

1255
02:29:08,105 --> 02:29:10,972
You cut this arm.
Remember?

1256
02:29:11,909 --> 02:29:14,969
Now this arm is going to
make you tell where the diamonds are...

1257
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:17,547
Speak!

1258
02:29:21,018 --> 02:29:23,145
You broke this leg of mine.

1259
02:29:24,221 --> 02:29:28,180
Now this leg is going to smash
every bone of yours.

1260
02:29:29,026 --> 02:29:30,994
Speak. Where are the diamonds?

1261
02:29:35,599 --> 02:29:36,998
Hit him!
- Speak!

1262
02:29:42,473 --> 02:29:43,497
Let him go.

1263
02:29:44,041 --> 02:29:45,201
Stop.

1264
02:29:46,043 --> 02:29:48,011
I will tell you
where the diamonds are...

1265
02:29:48,179 --> 02:29:51,012
No! You won't tell them.

1266
02:29:52,083 --> 02:29:56,679
The diamonds belong to the country.
These dogs won't have them.

1267
02:29:57,054 --> 02:30:00,285
But we can't bear to see those
dogs hitting you.

1268
02:30:00,758 --> 02:30:04,194
By hitting me.
They're inviting their deaths.

1269
02:30:05,229 --> 02:30:07,697
Listen you bastards!

1270
02:30:08,966 --> 02:30:14,563
Unless I hack you to pieces
I'm not dying.

1271
02:30:15,006 --> 02:30:17,702
Really?
If this isn't working...

1272
02:30:18,075 --> 02:30:21,044
I know how to make you talk.

1273
02:30:23,848 --> 02:30:26,681
Ask him about the diamonds. Ask!

1274
02:33:52,056 --> 02:33:54,047
No Balwant. Don't kill us.

1275
02:33:54,458 --> 02:33:57,586
Take all our wealth.
But spare us...

1276
02:33:58,128 --> 02:33:59,720
Spare you?

1277
02:34:00,297 --> 02:34:03,926
The Substitute Court
has spared none.

1278
02:34:05,302 --> 02:34:09,398
Today I will kill the two of you
and achieve the purpose of my life.

1279
02:34:10,407 --> 02:34:12,932
And my brother's soul
will rest in peace.

1280
02:34:13,310 --> 02:34:15,369
No... no.
- Balwant. Don't.

1281
02:34:15,779 --> 02:34:16,746
No!

1282
02:34:36,467 --> 02:34:39,698
Kill me but give me the diamonds.

1283
02:34:44,241 --> 02:34:47,074
Substitute Court! Surrender.

1284
02:35:02,826 --> 02:35:05,818
Inspector General.
I have a request.

1285
02:35:07,064 --> 02:35:10,625
Finish off all those sinners
like Balbir and Ranavir.

1286
02:35:11,235 --> 02:35:14,568
Else. Again some Balwant
will take the law in his own hands.

1287
02:35:17,174 --> 02:35:18,664
I surrender...

1288
02:35:19,109 --> 02:35:21,441
Mr. Tandon. Arrest him.

1289
02:35:24,081 --> 02:35:26,675
I have no right to arrest him.
- Why not?

1290
02:35:27,084 --> 02:35:30,349
Because I have assisted the
Substitute Court in several cases.

1291
02:35:31,121 --> 02:35:34,090
So. I too surrender.

1292
02:35:37,094 --> 02:35:38,356
Arrest them.

1293
02:35:45,269 --> 02:35:47,601
May I meet my family once?

1294
02:36:06,223 --> 02:36:08,384
Take care of your mother.
