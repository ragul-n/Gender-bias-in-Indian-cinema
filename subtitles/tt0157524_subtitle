3
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,300
Come in Rekha.
We've been waiting for you.

4
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,000
I was late in getting the proof.

5
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,460
- Deepa, when did you arrive?
- I've been here since morning.

6
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,840
Here, look.
He's written the story...

7
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,950
and is printing it in the paper.

8
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,880
- Am I in it?
- All three of us!

9
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,150
Three heroes and three heroines.

10
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,940
Read it for us.

11
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,160
Life and Love

12
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Love is a precious gift of life.

13
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,100
It's the mother in the
blooming morning of life.

14
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,400
It's a friend in the
beautiful morning of life.

15
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,260
It's a woman in the
sultry afternoon of life.

16
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,940
It's an innocent child
in the evening of life.

17
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:41,200
And when the night of life falls,
love becomes one with the Maker.

18
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,730
Love and life came into
this world together.

19
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Love came to the cities and
has witnessed many revolutions.

20
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,300
Gradually the purity of
love turned to lust.

21
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,340
These days love is considered a thing.

22
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,940
It is measured by
thoughts, not emotions.

23
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,910
Nowadays people love with
their heads, not their hearts...

24
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,790
and they love the exhibition
of humans, not human beings.

25
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,720
They fall in love with
fame and competence.

26
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,530
And the problems that
are created by this...

27
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,190
sometimes hand you over to the
whirlpool rather than the shore.

28
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,200
This story unfolds one day
in the Janata Coffee House.

29
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,940
- Good day sir.
- Yes.

30
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,850
It's been a long time.
Where did you go?

31
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,020
- To commit suicide.
- Successful?

32
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,780
No. I didn't have money
for the rope.

33
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,360
You should have asked me.
I'd have lent it!

34
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,600
What a coward! Your life is
starting and you want to end it!

35
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,900
You would say,
you'd make a great painting.

36
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,560
You'd go abroad!
You'd get 1000 rupees!

37
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,180
If you want to enjoy,
you must fight life!

38
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,810
Fight tooth and nail! Get it?

39
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,500
Now tell me, hot or cold?

40
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,900
- Water.
- I know. Plain water.

41
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,830
May I sit here?

42
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,800
Sure. I don't own the seat.

43
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,630
Hello. Fine?

44
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,710
Excuse me, I've been sitting
at this table for six years.

45
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,080
If you don't mind,
may I sit here today too?

46
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,690
- Sure.
- Thanks.

47
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,996
- Good day sir.
- Good day.

48
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,340
- I know you love water. How many glasses?
- Just one.

49
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:50,510
- One glass cold water.
- Not cold! Hot, boiling hot!

50
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,600
Cold water will ruin my throat.

51
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,380
You seem to be fond of singing.

52
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,490
That's my profession.
I'm a born singer!

53
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,120
I've been singing since birth.

54
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,520
My voice is sweeter than
Talat Mehmood and Manna Dey.

55
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,830
I can sing in a pitch
higher than Mohammed Rafi.

56
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,930
And can sing lower
than Hemant Kumar.

57
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,470
Alas! Fate! No music
director gives me a chance!

58
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,920
But a day will come when every
music director will want me!

59
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,130
Lovely! That's nice.

60
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,220
If a dog can have its day
why can't a man's day come?

61
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,320
That was about me.
What are you guys?

62
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,200
I'm a small writer.
You must have heard of Triveni.

63
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,440
The Triveni where the rivers Ganga,
Jamuna and Saraswati meet?

64
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,880
No, this is not that one. It's a
paper and I'm the editor and owner.

65
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,680
- You must have read it?
- I have no time to die!

66
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,050
Which is precisely why
newspapers don't sell.

67
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,490
I print 2000 copies of this paper.
200 are sold. The rest goes as trash.

68
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,030
6 annas a seer and the seer
is made of 12 ounces. Say what?

69
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,230
Excellent business sir!

70
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,170
- Hot water...
- Boiling hot?

71
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,410
Will you only have water,
or eat something too?

72
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,640
- One cold coffee.
- Cold coffee. And you?

73
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,370
Hot for me. Absolutely hot!

74
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,620
Hot water, hot milk, hot cup.
If possible hot sugar too!

75
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,830
What about you, sir?

76
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,970
No milk, no sugar.

77
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,080
Without milk or sugar?
What's your problem?

78
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,790
Why do you drink black coffee?

79
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,620
All the great painters of the world
paint with the blood of their heart.

80
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,260
They would drink black coffee
and wear black shrouds.

81
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,960
So you're a painter? Let me see.

82
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,540
Lovely! What a sketch!

83
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,760
I hope you're in your senses?

84
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,670
No one even looks at my pictures,
and you're praising it?

85
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,466
Of course. I can print it
in my paper if you wish.

86
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,240
There are takers for my sketches
even for free!

87
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,810
- And you want to print it?
- Why not?

88
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,180
- Where do you live?
- Close by.

89
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,380
I'd like to see your other paintings.

90
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,890
My house? You want
to see my paintings?

91
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,490
I'll bring them here.
Or to your office.

92
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,280
Why do you want to trouble
yourself and come home?

93
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,990
I'll be glad. Come on.

94
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,730
- Will you come?
- Sorry, I've got to go to a studio.

95
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,600
- I have a trial recording.
- Then we'll meet tomorrow.

96
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,350
Here. Let's shake on that.

97
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,150
What a combination!

98
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,260
Black coffee, cold coffee and
hot coffee! What a combination!

99
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,170
- Who'll pay for this?
- You pay it today. I'll pay later.

100
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,600
- Who'll drink it?
- You.

101
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,850
Hot coffee!

102
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
Cold coffee!

103
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,620
Come in. No need to fear.
This is my humble home.

104
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,930
- Come on.
- Unlock the door.

105
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,660
- I've lost the key. Come on.
- Where?

106
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,840
Open sesame!

107
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,520
Did you see that? Come in.

108
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,110
It's pitch dark in here.
Switch on the light.

109
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,220
Don't talk of lights.
The bills are too much.

110
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,390
The other room is well lit. Come.

111
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,320
- How do you work here?
- I paint at night.

112
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,610
- And during the day?
- I try to sell it.

113
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,970
Open the window. You don't have
to pay for sunlight and a breeze.

114
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,980
This window is more
dangerous than the light.

115
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,210
The main door locked.
Entry is from the back door.

116
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,090
Lights off, window shut.
Do you mind if I ask a question?

117
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,570
- Yes?
- Is this your house?

118
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,910
Yes!

119
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,510
No point hiding from you.
I haven't paid the rent in six months.

120
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,120
My landlord lives across.

121
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,700
If he finds out I'm here,
I'll be in trouble!

122
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,700
You'll die of suffocation! Don't
worry, I'll pay the rent if he asks.

123
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,136
And if he says something wrong,
I have a pen and a paper.

124
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,896
I'll raise a storm against him!

125
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,540
- Please don't.
- I'll see what he does!

126
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,620
Your landlord seems very strict.

127
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,490
I did tell you!

128
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,400
Father, get up!

129
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,410
- Who is it?
- It's me, father.

130
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,680
I thought your mother had come.

131
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,290
It's only 5 o'clock
and you went to sleep!

132
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,870
Five in the morning or evening?

133
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,930
You never remember anything!

134
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,470
- Do you know I just saw him?
- Keep looking at him.

135
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,940
- Who did you see?
- The painter.

136
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,740
I was standing by the window
and finally saw him.

137
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,290
- I'll just call him!
- It's teatime. lnvite him for tea.

138
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,120
For the rent, not for tea!

139
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,950
He'll pay it later if not now.
And even if he doesn't pay...

140
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,390
it's our good fortune that such
a famous painter lives in our house.

141
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:30,270
Our house isn't an inn!
Today I'll get the rent!

142
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,670
Ramu not Shamu.

143
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,720
Go and call him.

144
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,630
- Who? - Him!
- The painter?

145
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,980
- Go fast.
- Right.

146
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,450
Master said he's at home
but the door is locked.

147
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,960
I warned you not
to open the window.

148
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,400
But you paid no heed!
Now tell me what to do.

149
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,990
- I'll go and see.
- No! Don't go!

150
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,830
If he discovers the back door,
I won't be able to come here!

151
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,400
Don't you worry. I'll sort it out.

152
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,530
- Do you want to break the door?
- Master has called you.

153
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,040
Which master? Younger or elder?

154
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,480
- Elder.
- Elder.

155
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,040
- Hello.
- Hello. What do you want?

156
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,950
Nothing. You tell me
what you want.

157
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,030
- Nothing.
- How funny! You sent your servant.

158
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,740
I gave you my house
assuming you're a good sort.

159
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,700
I'm not your tenant. I'm his friend.

160
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,810
- Who called you?
- He's busy so I came.

161
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,880
- What did you want to say?
- I won't talk at all!

162
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,190
- I want the rent!
- He'll give it.

163
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:30,190
He's shown me his face just once!
Comes and leaves like a thief!

164
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,530
I never said a word this long.
But today I want the rent.

165
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,630
- How much is it?
- For 6 years. - 6 years?

166
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,960
- No, 6 months.
- Pardon?

167
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,370
Wait.

168
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,650
- Rekha
- Yes?

169
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,080
- How much does the rent total?
- Nothing.

170
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,010
- Nothing.
- What?

171
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,530
How is that possible?
I want the rent today. Understand?

172
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:04,610
Yes. What do you think of us?
We are artists not thieves.

173
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,460
You must look at the helplessness
on our faces, our torn clothes.

174
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:16,449
Our empty pockets. Artists
create for you, not themselves!

175
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,880
You adorn your drawing
room with our paintings.

176
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,909
You entertain yourselves
with our music.

177
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,140
You exercise your brains
with our writing.

178
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,910
Without our art, your world
wouldn't be beautiful! Interesting.

179
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,090
If you still consider us
so debauched and lowly...

180
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,690
here is your rent.

181
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,630
2 rupees 12 annas.
I'll pay the rest later.

182
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,670
Don't be offended.
That's not what father meant.

183
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,800
- Right, daddy?
- Definitely not.

184
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,540
- Keep this.
- No, let it be.

185
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,060
Please keep it.

186
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,410
Don't worry about the rent.

187
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,110
Consider it your own house.
Right, father?

188
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,540
Yes, absolutely your own.

189
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,760
And he can stay here
as long as he's alive.

190
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,810
Thank you. Good day.

191
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,770
Excuse me! Don't take
father's words to heart.

192
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,040
God knows what has happened
to him since mother passed a way.

193
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,580
- I hope you're not offended.
- Not at all.

194
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,150
In fact, I'm glad to meet you.

195
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,530
Me too.

196
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,780
I've wanted to meet you
since you first came here.

197
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,620
- Meet me?
- Yes.

198
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,130
You wouldn't know
how much I respect you.

199
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,540
You're such a great painter!

200
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Me? You are mistaken.

201
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,080
- I'm just a small...
- Your saying won't make you small.

202
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,400
- No, I'm just a small...
- Forget it.

203
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,420
I know.

204
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,910
Fine. If you say, so be it.

205
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,590
I, too, am fond of painting.
I use the brush sometimes.

206
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,990
Lovely! Okay, good day.

207
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,600
Listen, I'll come along.

208
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,080
I want to see your paintings.

209
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,750
My paintings?
You want to see them?

210
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,260
That's very nice. But not now.

211
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,990
- Why not?
- That painter...

212
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,800
My friend? He's working there.

213
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,840
- So what?
- No, you mustn't go when he's there.

214
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,380
Some other day I'll
show you the paintings.

215
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,220
Are you happy now?

216
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,520
Okay, bye.

217
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,096
I have fallen for you, my love

218
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,100
With my hands on my heart...

219
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,186
and together with the stars...

220
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,010
I stayed up all night, my love

221
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,510
The twinkling stars have
started setting...

222
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,970
taking turns, one by one

223
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,820
The glow has also begun
to steadily dim

224
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,290
The brightness has also
started to pale.

225
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,870
Even the moon has got
tired from its travels

226
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,800
But those in love
are still not tired

227
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:54,030
The whole world was sound asleep,
lost in dreams

228
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,720
Even the lovely breeze had stopped

229
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,050
The waves were also subdued

230
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,820
Then why I was
not able to sleep?

231
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,430
This no one is able to explain

232
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,730
I have fallen for you, my love

233
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,030
A number of times
the moon asked me...

234
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,770
what was going on with me

235
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,280
"For whom have you
started doing penance?"

236
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,650
"Whose disciple have
you become?"

237
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,360
All I could manage to say...

238
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,206
was that I had been
stricken by love

239
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,170
I have fallen for you, my love

240
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,940
- What happened?
- A whole lot.

241
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,950
Everything is fine. Now you can
shut this door and open the front.

242
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,850
Your landlord is very nice!
He has excused your rent.

243
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,260
- What?
- No more paying rent.

244
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,660
Thank you very much.
I'll go and thank him.

245
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,500
No! No need to do that.
I've fixed everything.

246
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,970
I must. I'll be back!

247
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,910
- Good day.
- You just wished me and left.

248
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,050
That was my friend, not me.

249
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,580
- What do you want?
- You excused my rent. Thanks.

250
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,160
But some day I'll pay your rent.

251
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,350
But you must work hard
on your paintings.

252
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,920
- Make good paintings.
- I will.

253
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,100
- Make a portrait for me, too.
- Sure.

254
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
- What shall I get you? Plain water?
- No way.

255
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,486
Today I want coffee!
With milk and sugar!

256
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,670
But you drink black coffee and paint.

257
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,270
Then I'd paint. Now they sell.
Quickly coffee with milk and sugar.

258
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,430
Yes sir. Milk and sugar...

259
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,336
- I'm dead!
- What happened?

260
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,920
The neighborhood wants me out!
I've changed 60 houses in 6 years.

261
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,020
They always throw me out.
They'll make me vacate today too!

262
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,220
- Why?
- Because I sing.

263
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,220
If I don't sing, Hemant Kumar
will always retain his position.

264
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,940
And Talat Mehmood his position.
And I'll always remain Mohan!

265
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,740
- What do I do?
- We must go to Pradeep.

266
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,910
- Pradeep? What will he do?
- He can do everything.

267
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,280
He can do anything with
the power of the pen!

268
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,010
Your voice and my brush can't do it.

269
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,790
The pen is mightier than the sword.

270
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,650
He can fight the whole world
with the force of his pen!

271
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,520
- Know what he did yesterday?
- What?

272
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,370
He got me excused from
paying rent like this!

273
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,366
Can he get my singing started?

274
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes, like this! Let's go.

275
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,580
- Your coffee with milk.
- You drink it.

276
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,870
- Where is your master?
- He was here.

277
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,200
He must have gone to the press.

278
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,670
- I'll get him.
- I'll come with you.

279
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,720
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

280
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,040
The gathering is excited
because the admirer has come.

281
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,470
Flame, hold your heart.
The moth has come.

282
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,480
Excuse me, I've come to bother you.

283
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,460
- I sent some stories by post.
- Very good.

284
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,420
- But they didn't get printed.
- Very good.

285
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,320
- But won't they get printed?
- Never.

286
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,300
You must have something on your mind.

287
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,670
Thinking? I'm dying!
Matter of life and death.

288
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,740
- New plot?
- Not by itself. It has a building.

289
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,950
And an entire neighborhood.
A serious situation.

290
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,610
Sounds like a detective story.

291
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:51,590
No detective works here.
All are middle class people.

292
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,200
No way. Only hatred.
Cruelty, atrocities!

293
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,740
Got it! Problem story.

294
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,900
Exactly! Only problems.
On one hand you have a poor singer.

295
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:13,780
On the other, the entire
neighborhood wants to evict him.

296
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,500
And he's asking an editor for help.

297
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,710
Have you thought of an ending?

298
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:26,300
God alone knows. I've been
thinking for two days. No solution.

299
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,270
Terrible situation!

300
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,270
Don't worry. Tell me the gist.
I'll give you a solution.

301
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,930
- Really?
- Yes.

302
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,890
- Tell me.
- Sit down.

303
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,270
- Tell me fast.
- Wipe the sweat.

304
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,110
How have you found the
solution so fast?

305
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:56,380
A woman can complete a job in minutes
that might take a man months.

306
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,660
Man thinks a lot and
woman understands more.

307
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,400
Explain it to me, too.
Tell me the solution.

308
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,500
- Pradeep isn't here. Let's go.
- Hold on!

309
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,820
She's giving me a solution.
Please hurry up.

310
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,070
She can't do anything.
You come with me.

311
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,360
No, only she can help me!

312
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,260
- I'll come with you. Come on.
- Listen...

313
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,200
- Don't go, I'll come back.
- Okay.

314
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,690
Your house is very nice.

315
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,690
Yes, but I'm being evicted!

316
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,900
Nobody can throw you out.
Start singing, come on!

317
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,060
I know my neighbors well.
You dragged me for nothing.

318
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,436
That lady was solving my problem.

319
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,940
Forget the lady. Sing.

320
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,096
The song is getting me evicted.
Will you get my bones broken?

321
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,180
You have to sing if
you want to stay here.

322
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,980
How high a pitch?

323
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,890
- Whose tone?
- Anyone's.

324
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,530
Sing as loud as you can.
I'll see who comes here.

325
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,570
Sir, bless me.

326
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,580
Mother, hear that?

327
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,370
Who must that be? Sounds
just like a Banarasi.

328
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,650
We've got a house in such
a good neighborhood.

329
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,680
Scolded him in the morning
yet he has no shame!

330
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,230
He's so thick skinned!
Beat him with this broom!

331
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,790
God knows where he has come from!

332
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,870
Doesn't let us sit in peace!
Made our lives miserable!

333
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,580
We'll see about this!

334
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,210
Will you stop singing or not?

335
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,980
- Why did you stop singing?
- He would if I wouldn't!

336
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,790
He can't do that. Start again.

337
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,580
No, you don't know.
He's no priest but Pesha Warilal!

338
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,606
He comes, goes, beats with a stick!

339
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,000
I'll handle him. You start singing.

340
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,810
I'm dead!

341
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,070
This son of Tansen stops,
then starts singing again.

342
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,860
But I'll stop him!
Or I'll change my name.

343
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,080
I'll break his head!

344
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,240
Halt! Why are you yelling?
Is he harming you?

345
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,090
He doesn't let us sit, eat or sleep!
Keeps singing all the time!

346
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:28,445
- He sings in his house not yours.
- That's right, but I hear it.

347
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,089
Then shut your door!

348
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,500
Bravo!

349
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,690
If you hate music, why do
you sing hymns for God?

350
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,609
Why do you sing prayers?
Why go to temples?

351
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,180
If music is found there,
why not here?

352
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,830
She is right and he sings well.

353
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,480
Go to your houses.
I'll go to mine.

354
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,050
He sings well. Okay? I'm going.

355
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,740
We're dead!

356
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,930
I'll check.

357
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,456
Why are you folks yelling?

358
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,530
What right do you have to interfere
if one dances, sings in his house?

359
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,540
Don't listen if you don't want to.
Stuff cotton in your ears!

360
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,330
Leave this house! Don't interrupt!

361
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,520
Complain to the police!
File a suit against us!

362
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,320
But the song won't be stopped! Never!

363
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,950
- It mustn't.
- Thank you.

364
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,150
What did you say?

365
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:05,280
I don't want the song
to end but to continue.

366
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,800
To continue? My song?

367
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,190
You sing so well!

368
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,280
- I sing well?
- Such pain in the voice!

369
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,050
In my voice?

370
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,310
Please sing the song you were singing.

371
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,890
I must sing? Here?

372
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,660
- Then let's go to the room.
- Room?

373
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:44,010
Listen, get up.
The fact is...

374
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,180
We live in this society.
What will people say?

375
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,070
All right. Then come to my house.

376
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,640
- Where do you live?
- Above you.

377
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,520
You mean on my head?

378
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,290
In the room above yours.

379
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,100
You go to your house.
And I'll go to my room.

380
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,310
- Where are you?
- Under the cot.

381
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,650
What happened to Pesha Warilal?

382
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:33,380
Gone! Now you needn't fear.
You can sing day and night.

383
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,290
Anything you want to sing!

384
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,230
- You are great!
- Come out.

385
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,090
Sit here.

386
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,400
- Sing.
- Sing?

387
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:53,540
- Yes, I promised them.
- No, I can't sing!

388
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,680
- My throat is sore!
- Earlier they wanted to evict you for singing.

389
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,920
Now they'll evict you
if you don't sing!

390
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,110
Understood! I'll start.

391
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Who has come?

392
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:41,620
Who has come
to my mind's doorstep?

393
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,540
I hear the sound of anklets

394
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,550
The eye does not know,
but the heart recognizes...

395
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,770
a distinctive face like this

396
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,490
I cannot remember
even if I try...

397
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,600
an image quite like this

398
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,500
This crazy mind,
lost in thought...

399
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,400
building a world of dreams

400
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:38,720
One moment I think, my desire...

401
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,500
has appeared in front of me
in a different shape

402
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,930
The next moment
I begin to fear...

403
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,430
that this not be
just a shadow...

404
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:12,010
that has come to
a stranger's place...

405
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,310
with a strange sort of love

406
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,820
Who has come
to my mind's doorstep?

407
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,356
I hear the sound of anklets

408
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,720
Who has come?

409
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,050
Plain water.

410
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,500
Cold water.

411
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,050
Hot water.

412
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,490
- Today water doesn't taste nice.
- Why? What happened to you?

413
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,550
What would you know? Since
yesterday a plot is in my head.

414
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,100
But I couldn't write a word.

415
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:21,100
The noise in the press, business
tension and people coming and going.

416
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,880
- Then you can write in my room.
- Your room?

417
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,280
Yes, that's right.
You can paint anywhere.

418
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,960
If you don't find any place,
you can go to my room.

419
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,990
- But what about you?
- The Lord will take care.

420
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,600
I'll go to a temple and practice.

421
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,770
Mohan, you can go to my
office if you wish.

422
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,480
- What's the use?
- Why not?

423
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,730
Your office?

424
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,300
Good thought!

425
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:10,360
Machines will run and I'll sing.
Nobody will hear me or stop me.

426
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,010
I'll practice so hard that Hemant
Kumar and Talat will be out of films!

427
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,500
People coming and going.
Give me the key.

428
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,510
- I don't have it. The peon has it.
- Peon?

429
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,520
- Let's get it from him.
- I must come? Okay.

430
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,050
- May I come in?
- Sure, lady.

431
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,990
- I am called Kalpana.
- That's a lovely name!

432
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,950
- Please take a seat.
- Thanks.

433
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,040
- How are you?
- Thanks to you.

434
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,770
You left yesterday but
I waited for you for four hours.

435
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,200
- You waited for me?
- One has to.

436
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,620
And I didn't turn up.
That's very bad. lncorrect!

437
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:14,930
I should be ashamed!
I should kill myself.

438
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,790
Don't be mad at yourself.

439
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,290
For your sake I won't
be harsh on myself.

440
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,640
- Forget it.
- How is your terrible situation?

441
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,400
- Sorted out.
- What's the end?

442
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,810
Happy ending.

443
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,640
I've written a new poem today.
Will you print it?

444
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:46,380
Why not? New, old, anything,
I'll print it all!

445
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,290
It goes like this.

446
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:59,260
The heart will need the heart.

447
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:07,910
The heart will need the heart.
Then I will be at peace.

448
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,210
Excellent!

449
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:16,060
The heart will need the heart.
Then I will be at peace.

450
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,340
Further, you, too, will be maligned.

451
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,970
Further, you, too, will be maligned.
I, too, will be accused.

452
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,560
That's terrific!

453
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,820
You will be maligned.
I, too, will be accused.

454
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,390
The last verse...

455
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,070
Why do you fear infamy?

456
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:52,810
Why do you fear infamy?
Whose name will remain forever?

457
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,530
Fantastic!

458
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,030
Give this to the press.
It has to be printed now.

459
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,010
- But sir?
- Nothing doing. Do as I say!

460
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,310
- Are you happy?
- Thanks a lot!

461
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,200
I want to trouble you a little more.

462
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,150
Trouble? At your service, madam.

463
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,670
Please have dinner with
me if you are free.

464
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,120
- Dinner?
- Any objections?

465
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,660
Objections?
I'm fed up eating at hotels!

466
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,270
- You eat in hotels?
- That's right.

467
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,600
Hotel or market or starve!
Terrible situation!

468
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,870
- Then come on.
- Right away!

469
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,270
It's only the brave who
fall in the battlefield!

470
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,340
Is he your younger brother?

471
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,530
No. Elder brother.
Fifteen years elder to me.

472
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,020
Fifteen years!
Then he's elder to me, too!

473
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,340
- Good day.
- Live long.

474
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,750
I'm called Captain Arjun.

475
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,590
Is this your name
or your entire team's?

476
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:42,190
His name is Arjun, the rest
are like the cricket ground.

477
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:47,990
- Glad to meet you.
- Who are you?

478
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,410
- He's a famous writer!
- Famous writer?

479
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,210
The editor of Triveni.
You've heard of Triveni?

480
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,780
- I don't think so.
- Neither have I.

481
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,700
- Funny!
- You are being funny. Who calls me a writer?

482
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,960
They will someday! I'm sure!

483
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,930
I'll talk to him. You ask
them to serve lunch.

484
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,700
- Take a seat.
- Sure.

485
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,880
Good! Very good!

486
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,730
Don't read these.
I wrote them long ago.

487
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:44,660
What are you saying?
Old is better than new.

488
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,460
Old literature or music.
Old furniture...

489
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,950
old shoes... are better.

490
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,400
I kept calling for you,
you kept torturing me

491
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,480
My dear, what sort
of love is this really?

492
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,280
Don't harass me like this.
Don't torture me like this

493
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,350
I have already told you
that I do love you

494
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,200
Where have you learned
to complain like this?

495
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,220
It is not good to
have habits like this

496
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,840
You don't even smile.
You don't even come close

497
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,730
How do I know
this is indeed love?

498
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,750
Don't harass me like this.
Don't torture me like this

499
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,600
I have already told you
that I do love you

500
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,360
I kept calling for you.
You kept torturing me

501
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,260
My dear, what sort
of love is this really?

502
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,840
I have already made you mine

503
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,740
My heart is already lost to you

504
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,370
I am also yours.
Take my word for it

505
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,360
When did I ever say I hate you?

506
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,110
I kept calling for you.
You kept torturing me

507
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:39,230
My dear, what sort
of love is this really?

508
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,990
Don't harass me like this.
Don't torture me like this

509
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:47,040
I have already told you
that I do love you

510
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,100
I kept calling for you.
You kept torturing me

511
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,640
This song of yours is very nice.

512
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,070
I wrote it for a film company.

513
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,690
- But they rejected it.
- Film men never like good things!

514
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:35,460
They've rejected me, too!
Forget them. But, you write well.

515
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,850
I'm writing a new story.
I want to discuss it with you.

516
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,790
- Discuss a story?
- Yes.

517
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:52,440
- Am I a writer?
- Yes, and no ordinary writer.

518
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,400
- A very good one!
- Terrible situation!

519
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,310
- Terrible situation again?
- Yes.

520
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,060
Every situation is terrible for me.

521
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,010
You're too much!

522
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,250
I'll give you the gist of the story.

523
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:14,470
It's lunch time.
Let's meet at Janata Coffee House.

524
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,500
- Janata Coffee House?
- Yes. - Why?

525
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,890
Many great men visit it.

526
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,630
And they're all my friends!

527
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,050
You too are in trouble.
So am I!

528
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,510
There's no place better than
Janata Coffee House for this.

529
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,770
- What time should I come?
- About 3 or 4.

530
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,360
I'll be there at 4 sharp.

531
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,880
- Let's have lunch.
- Sure.

532
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,950
Lord! Protection!

533
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,630
So this is your teacher?

534
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,200
Yes. The poor man is dead.

535
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,050
- Were you waiting for me?
- Yes. Since morning.

536
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,430
I'm in grave trouble.

537
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,620
When I started singing Bhairavi,
I was in quite a fix.

538
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:24,640
I couldn't understand whether
'tha' is sharp or soft.

539
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,930
You can use any one you want.

540
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,010
That's not possible.
It has to be one or the other.

541
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,470
Both can be used.
My teacher used either.

542
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,850
Then it may be possible.
Please sing both for me.

543
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:51,810
Sing? I told you once...
we live in a society.

544
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:56,430
If I sing and somebody sees you,
it won't be nice.

545
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,960
You'll never sing for me?

546
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:04,140
Of course I will.
But outside, not here.

547
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,910
- At the sea shore.
- Then let's go there.

548
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,740
At this hour? It's very hot.

549
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,580
- Then?
- Do one thing.

550
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,330
Meet me at Janata Coffee
House at 4 o'clock.

551
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,150
- You'll sing there?
- I won't sing!

552
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,450
We'll have coffee.
It will clear the throat.

553
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,710
I'll go and ask mother.

554
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,880
- Will she also come?
- No. I'll just get permission.

555
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,710
- Janata Coffee House.
- 4 o'clock.

556
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,720
Hello.

557
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,610
Hello. How are you?

558
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,950
As if you care!
Where were you all night?

559
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,460
I kept waiting for you.
I even kept dinner for you.

560
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,680
- Why didn't you come?
- I'd gone to a friend's house.

561
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,470
- I was working.
- You paint at night, too?

562
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:14,240
All great painters work at night!
And try to sell them during the day.

563
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,490
- Really?
- Yes, come in.

564
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,920
Excellent!

565
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:38,710
- These paintings are so nice!
- Yes. Each one has its own class.

566
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,510
Who is this?

567
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,620
This? A girl.

568
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:58,480
Which is why I ask...
Who is she?

569
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,390
She... once she was a model.

570
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,470
- Absolutely.
- Then I, too, will be a model!

571
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,630
Paint my portrait, too!

572
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,600
Me? I can't paint you!

573
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,280
Why not?

574
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,860
- Am I not worthy?
- No, I'm not worthy.

575
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,620
What? You're such a good painter!

576
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,730
That's the problem.
You think I'm too good a painter.

577
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,650
But I know that I know nothing.

578
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,270
Look at these paintings.
Hanging since they were painted!

579
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,930
- Not one got sold.
- So what?

580
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,830
I'll buy all your paintings.

581
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,680
You? All the paintings?

582
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,000
- Now are you happy?
- Yes. Very!

583
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,820
- Will you have tea with me?
- Tea?

584
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,150
- Come along.
- Thanks but the fact is...

585
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:08,560
I don't like tea at all.
I drink coffee.

586
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,460
So we'll make coffee for you!

587
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,760
Coffee at home isn't fun.
It's fun at Janata Coffee House.

588
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,740
Will you come with me?

589
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:28,040
But how can I come
without asking father?

590
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:32,010
- Then ask him. Will you come?
- All right.

591
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,010
- At 6.
- Fine.

592
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,420
Listen... at 4, not 6.

593
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:44,030
It's very crowded at 6.
All kinds of people come.

594
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,030
All right, I'll come at 4.

595
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:28,880
What shall I get you?
Hot coffee or cold?

596
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,270
A glass of water. Water.

597
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,510
- Plain.
- Water... plain.

598
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,130
How are you? Long time no see.

599
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:17,170
Involved with singing.

600
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,390
I was going to buy a tanpura.
Thought I'd have a glass of water.

601
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,010
- Sit down.
- Are you going?

602
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,290
- Sit...
- No, you sit.

603
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,320
I have an appointment with the
tanpura seller for 4 o'clock.

604
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,820
Water...

605
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,120
What are you staring at?
Get me some coffee.

606
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,930
- Cold or hot?
- Hot.

607
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,810
- Where have you been?
- Don't ask.

608
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,876
Busy with a painting.

609
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,050
I see. Found free time today?

610
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,280
Today, I was going to the art
gallery. Dropped by for coffee.

611
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,790
You sit. I'm leaving.

612
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,390
I have to reach the art
gallery by 4 o'clock.

613
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:11,540
It's already past four.

614
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,300
I'm going. You sit.

615
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,070
Hot coffee, madam.

616
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,220
What's wrong?

617
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,190
What's wrong? Help!

618
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,730
What's the matter?

619
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,050
- The bearer fainted.
- How?

620
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,860
He saw me and fainted!

621
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,170
- What?
- I'm too pretty!

622
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,960
Returned from the art gallery?

623
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,250
Yes, no...

624
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,510
- Actually...
- Don't worry.

625
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:41,020
This is the first step of love.
Why do you cry?

626
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:44,860
Wait and watch what happens ahead.

627
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:48,110
Let's be together by ourselves.

628
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,320
We are crazy birds

629
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,510
We have one tune

630
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,476
We have one destination

631
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,900
We are crazy about love

632
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:11,900
Leaving this earth behind...

633
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,580
we have to go beyond the clouds

634
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:30,710
Picking out beautiful
stars in the sky...

635
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,300
we have to build our own nest

636
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,226
We have one focus

637
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,950
We have one sense of fun

638
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,420
We have the same tales to tell

639
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:45,750
We are crazy birds

640
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,140
My heart's desire tells me...

641
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:20,190
not to ever stop

642
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,240
Even if these stars
are threatened by storm...

643
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:39,100
don't think of hiding from them

644
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,716
Love is like a flame

645
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,470
We are true to our hearts

646
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,940
So we are like moths
circling love

647
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,440
We are crazy birds

648
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:13,090
Now that we have
set out together...

649
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,910
we will definitely
find our destination

650
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,010
The heart where we are
to make our homes...

651
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,690
we will definitely
find that heart

652
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,260
We crazy people have
set out today...

653
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,700
to set up a new
world for ourselves

654
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:47,160
We are crazy birds

655
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,680
We have one tune

656
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,570
We have one destination

657
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:57,970
We are crazy about love

658
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,170
We are crazy birds

659
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,320
It's 10 o'clock. Time for
the coffee house to shut.

660
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,600
We don't let people sleep here.

661
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:52,039
Sir, who will pay the bill?

662
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,970
- What for?
- 30 glasses of water.

663
01:08:56,189 --> 01:08:59,409
- And 15 pounds...
- Of ice.

664
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,770
You pay it.

665
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:28,610
I went to the coffee house
but I couldn't meet you.

666
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:36,050
I met a friend so I
had to leave the place.

667
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:43,389
I know you must be hurt.
But I couldn't help it.

668
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:47,059
I apologize.

669
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:50,470
Forget it now!

670
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:52,690
Go away.

671
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,570
Thief! Father, thief!

672
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,510
The love of the girls
of today is a farce.

673
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:13,340
They pretend to be in love.
False smiles. False promises.

674
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,560
They consider love a game.

675
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,030
Their love is a deception,
fallacy, fraud.

676
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:25,420
That's wrong. If I couldn't
meet you that day...

677
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:29,750
- it doesn't mean I cheated you.
- But you promised to come there!

678
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:36,290
And I came there. But a friend
came by and I couldn't wait for you.

679
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,700
- Who are you?
- I...!

680
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,540
- What do you want?
- Nothing!

681
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,550
- Why have you come here?
- Help!

682
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:02,360
I apologize because I couldn't
meet you at the coffee house.

683
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,000
My friend showed up and
I couldn't wait for long.

684
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,680
You are angry with me.
Why are you breaking the records?

685
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,780
- Don't break it.
- Let go! I don't want to talk to you!

686
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,190
Who are you?

687
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,760
Mother!

688
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:28,190
Had it! Lady, be conscious.

689
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,290
Fan! Shoe!

690
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:44,950
Lady, get up! Did you have
to find my house to swoon?

691
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,310
Get up.

692
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,420
Sit down lady.

693
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:28,300
Take this fan. Fan yourself.

694
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,550
Everything is in place. Did the
thief come for the paintings?

695
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:40,730
When the painter gets nothing,
what would the robber get?

696
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,540
No thief came here.

697
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,190
Father is strange!

698
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:53,010
Get a lock. The big one?
Hurry up.

699
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:58,880
- You?
- Thank God you've come.

700
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,290
Thief!

701
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:07,420
- In your room.
- A thief in my room?

702
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:13,010
- Where is he?
- He's not here but he was.

703
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,440
When I came to see you,
he was sitting here.

704
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:23,640
You are being ridiculous.
He was my friend, not a thief.

705
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:29,030
He doesn't have any stuff
so he comes here to work.

706
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,120
These days the weather is bad.

707
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:43,420
Everything goes wrong, everywhere!

708
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,100
- Really?
- Yes.

709
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,610
- You're not mad at me?
- Mad at you? I can't be.

710
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,840
- Paint me today.
- Your portrait?

711
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,400
Here's a sheet of paper. Begin.

712
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:12,090
Fix it.

713
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,800
Begin.

714
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:25,560
Get some water.
Cold water. Ice water.

715
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:27,740
Ice water is bad for the throat.

716
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:32,180
Not to drink. To pour over
my head, cool me down!

717
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,530
- How many buckets?
- One.

718
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,420
You're back? What's wrong with you?

719
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:49,460
- Look into my eyes.
- Why?

720
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,260
- Can you see?
- Yes.

721
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,110
- What do you see?
- Yes.

722
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,840
What?

723
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,790
- My face!
- Had it!

724
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:01,010
- What?
- Look at my face not yours!

725
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:04,880
- I can see that.
- Don't you want to swoon?

726
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,480
- No.
- But a girl just fainted on seeing me.

727
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,420
- Girl?
- Yes. A girl!

728
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:13,380
- Where?
- In my room.

729
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,070
- In your room?
- Exactly.

730
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,490
- Was she alone?
- All alone.

731
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,790
- Who was she?
- God knows.

732
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,300
She came to your room
and you don't know her?

733
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:29,920
Maybe she stays in the society.
Came to my room by mistake.

734
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,470
Terrible situation!

735
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:41,040
I've brought the water.
Found a bucket not pail.

736
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:44,760
- Take it away.
- Okay sir.

737
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,760
I apologize for not meeting
you in the coffee house.

738
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,260
- She said the same thing.
- What?

739
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,250
You asked her too?

740
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:02,090
No. I'd asked you but
she was apologizing.

741
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:07,210
Strange!
She apologizes to you there.

742
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,130
And a man got mad at me here.

743
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:12,410
- I've had it!
- Who was he?

744
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:16,180
He is... my assistant.

745
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:21,450
- Where were you since morning?
- Where was I?

746
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,440
A song's been on my mind
since last evening.

747
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,330
- I was involved with it.
- I see. Let me hear it.

748
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:35,960
I'm still thinking about it.
I'm tired, hungry, thirsty, dying!

749
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,840
I'll get you something to eat.

750
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,520
You'll get food for me today, too?

751
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:45,580
Yes, I'll get it.
What makes you ask?

752
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:52,310
I had my mother then,
and now it's you.

753
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:09,700
Who has come
to my mind's doorstep?

754
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:15,300
I hear the sound of anklets

755
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:29,120
Who has come?

756
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:52,170
The eye does not know,
but the heart recognizes...

757
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:03,590
a distinctive face like this

758
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:20,500
I cannot remember
even if I try...

759
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:25,040
a distinctive face like this

760
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:31,850
This crazy mind,
lost in thought...

761
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:37,020
building a world of dreams

762
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:42,880
Who has come
to my mind's doorstep?

763
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:48,476
I hear the sound of anklets

764
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,510
Who has come?

765
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:08,440
One moment I think, my desire...

766
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:13,230
has appeared in front of me
in a different shape

767
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:30,540
The next moment
I begin to fear...

768
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:35,310
that this not be
just a shadow...

769
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:41,710
that has come to
a stranger's place...

770
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:47,386
with a strange sort of love

771
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:52,800
Who has come
to my mind's doorstep?

772
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:57,890
I hear the sound of anklets

773
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:00,980
Who has come?

774
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:08,970
It's ready.
You may see it.

775
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:11,570
Let me see!

776
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:15,880
- What's this?
- Your picture.

777
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:22,040
Do I look like this to you?

778
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,660
Yes, absolutely.
I could never make it better.

779
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,530
This is what I can really call
my creation. You don't understand.

780
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:35,220
I'll explain. Tell me what's
most beautiful in the sky.

781
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:46,630
- The moon.
- Exactly! A moon like face.

782
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,120
I mean, your face.
Symbolism, you see.

783
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,130
Hair, like dark clouds.

784
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:55,960
Your hair.

785
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,910
Plaits like snakes.

786
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:02,330
Bow shaped eyebrows.
Almond shaped eyes.

787
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,930
Pearly teeth and pot shaped neck.

788
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,540
- This is classic!
- Really?

789
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:15,720
- I'll send it to London!
- No! I won't let it go!

790
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,450
I'll keep it! I'll buy it!
I'll take it now and show father!

791
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,250
Look at this, father!

792
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:39,360
- It's nice.
- What nice? Look carefully.

793
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:44,330
A map. Which country's?

794
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:49,190
Map? It's a picture. My picture!

795
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:53,410
Yours? Are you like this?

796
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:58,720
The picture is like me.
It's called symbolism.

797
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:00,900
I'll explain.

798
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,190
Face like the moon.

799
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:08,300
Hair like dark clouds,
plaits like the snake.

800
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:13,940
And eyebrow shaped bows!
And bow shaped eyes! Eyes...

801
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,460
Snakes, almond bows.

802
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:20,450
- Have you gone mad?
- No!

803
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:25,220
It's a classic! And I'm
buying it for 500 rupees!

804
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:28,510
500! Your Pop's money?

805
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,740
Exactly!

806
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:34,320
But you don't have to pay cash.
Cut it from the rent.

807
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:37,860
So this is what the painter has done!

808
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,820
Is this why I excused 6 months
rent so he'd make fun of my child!

809
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:50,300
Tell him to make a nice picture.
Or I'll evict him!

810
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,470
I should get it by tomorrow evening.

811
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:57,490
You ruined my picture!

812
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,960
What are you doing here?

813
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:14,030
- Fanning myself.
- Are you all right?

814
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:17,700
- Not at all.
- What do you mean?

815
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,230
- Inside.
- Inside?

816
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:27,490
Everything is gone!

817
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:31,040
You're stripped of all your wealth.

818
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,100
What are you saying?

819
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:41,850
A man had come.
He broke all your records!

820
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:46,570
- Now what will happen?
- To the records?

821
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,470
Nothing.

822
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:55,810
- Can't anything be done?
- Sure, it can be done.

823
01:23:56,190 --> 01:24:03,980
As long as my voice is intact,
I can record many records for you!

824
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:07,390
But who was he?

825
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,990
- He, he is my student.
- Student?

826
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:18,830
Yes, for six years now.
But he hasn't learned anything.

827
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,340
He's a complete ass!

828
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:29,870
By now a real ass
would have learned everything.

829
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:35,200
Don't worry about him. I
won't let him come here again.

830
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:40,150
Now are you happy?

831
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,620
I hope you aren't angry?

832
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,740
Angry? With you?

833
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:57,050
Then come home with me.

834
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:01,990
- Your house?
- Yes, mother likes your songs.

835
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,300
- Your mother likes them?
- Yes.

836
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,720
- My songs?
- Yes. Come.

837
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,360
- Mother!
- Yes dear?

838
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,060
- See who has come.
- Who is it?

839
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,370
The one who lives under us
and sings every day.

840
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,870
Live long. Your voice
sounds like a Banarasi.

841
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,350
- My voice?
- When did you come from Banaras?

842
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:47,000
- From Banaras?
- Banaras is great.

843
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,450
I spent half my life there.

844
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:52,490
I wish God would
make cities like that.

845
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:57,530
Bathe on its ghats.
Wear its silken sarees.

846
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,140
And chew betel-nuts there.

847
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,440
Don't get taken in.

848
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:10,410
She lives in Bombay but
her mind is always there.

849
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,680
Why are you standing? Sit down.

850
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,640
Geeta, give him some sweets.

851
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:22,220
Where are you going?
I ate those inside.

852
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,900
- I'll get them from the market.
- Don't bother.

853
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,860
We don't let anyone leave
without having a sweet.

854
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,720
I like your songs.
Sing a hymn if you don't mind.

855
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,880
What, a hymn?

856
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:50,520
Lord blessed you with such a sweet
voice. You must only sing hymns.

857
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:57,020
Actually I can't sing.

858
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,520
I can't sing at all!

859
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:06,490
Geeta has made me a singer.

860
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,930
Forget about that. Take the
Lord's name and begin.

861
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,770
Just like we don't let anyone
leave home without a sweet...

862
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:22,150
similarly without singing too.

863
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,180
Come on.

864
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:28,590
I'll begin if you say.

865
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:35,840
Your throat is clear.
Why are you doing this?

866
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,200
I will.

867
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:56,810
Hari, Hari (name of the Lord)...

868
01:27:57,490 --> 01:28:03,290
protect my dignity, Hari

869
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,350
Keep rhythm, mother.

870
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:23,710
You know everything,
you Omniscient one!

871
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,710
You know, yes...

872
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:34,850
You know everything

873
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:48,170
You know everything,
you Omniscient one!

874
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:52,950
Nothing escapes you, oh my Lord

875
01:28:56,690 --> 01:29:00,700
Protect my dignity, my Lord!

876
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:10,056
- You also sing, son.
- Carry on.

877
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,880
No, no, my son,
you should also sing.

878
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:29,560
I am unable to rid myself
of bad habits

879
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:51,530
I am unable to rid myself
of bad habits

880
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:55,330
Help to purify me, my Lord!

881
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:04,300
Protect my dignity, my Lord!

882
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,580
Son, why are you quiet?
Sing along!

883
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:41,070
- What's going on?
- I was singing a hymn.

884
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,020
- Hymn?
- Yes.

885
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,230
- What happened?
- Nothing. Don't worry.

886
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:10,380
Take this.

887
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,630
Father didn't like it one bit.

888
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,620
I did tell you but
you wouldn't listen.

889
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:19,180
Nobody likes my paintings.

890
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,890
So I've decided to stop
painting and start writing.

891
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,560
I'll become a writer!

892
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:33,690
- You'll become a writer?
- Have you heard of Triveni?

893
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:36,790
I am its editor...
I mean my friend is.

894
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:40,440
You must have read it.
How is it?

895
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:42,390
Third class!

896
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,230
- Absolutely bogus!
- Absolutely bogus!

897
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:54,650
If you become a writer,
I won't talk to you.

898
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:00,490
Don't worry. I won't!
I'll always remain a painter.

899
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,420
Happy?

900
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,300
Now paint my picture.

901
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:09,460
You haven't forgotten the picture?

902
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:13,640
No, father said...

903
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:21,630
if you don't make a nice
picture, he'll evict you.

904
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:25,770
He'll throw me out?
I'll have to leave?

905
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:33,020
Do you have a photo of yourself?

906
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:37,400
- Yes, many.
- Get me one.

907
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:41,000
I'll stay up at night
and paint a nice picture.

908
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:44,770
Show it to your father.
He'll be very happy.

909
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:47,270
- Really?
- Yes.

910
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,910
I'll get one now!

911
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:02,720
I've bought a new tanpura.

912
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,180
- How is it?
- Very nice.

913
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:09,770
- Teach me one song.
- You'll learn from me?

914
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,760
- And today?
- Yes.

915
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,300
Fine.

916
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:20,900
You look worried.

917
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:24,240
Why do you care?
You want to learn a song.

918
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:28,310
- What's the matter?
- Matter of life and death!

919
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,310
And the decision is in your hands.

920
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:34,480
My hands? Speak clearly.

921
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,960
Should I? Wait.

922
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:46,860
Look at this.

923
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:51,140
- This is me!
- How is it?

924
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:54,890
- Beautiful. Who made it?
- I did.

925
01:33:56,810 --> 01:34:00,270
- Do you also paint?
- That's what I do.

926
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:05,310
- Singing is only a hobby.
- Really?

927
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:09,950
Yes. I've decided I'll stop
singing and only paint.

928
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:14,620
- You'll stop singing?
- Yes.

929
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:19,030
Nothing much in singing.
I've been singing for years.

930
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,840
I've taken so many tests but not passed.
I have wasted my life!

931
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:30,130
So I've decided to stop
singing and become a painter!

932
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:34,630
If you become a painter,
what will happen to me?

933
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,720
Don't worry. I'll find
a teacher for you.

934
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:44,370
No! You must teach me.

935
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:49,270
At least teach me one song.

936
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:54,700
- I'll always remember it.
- Sure you will.

937
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:59,310
But tomorrow not today.

938
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,040
Not in the mood today.

939
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,580
Doesn't matter.

940
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:11,990
Better tomorrow.

941
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,730
Have a seat.

942
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,960
- What are these?
- Manuscripts.

943
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,660
My songs, poems, stories, novels...

944
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,280
- For whom?
- For you.

945
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:33,570
Have you written all these?

946
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:39,090
There's more. If you don't
like these, I'll get others.

947
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:43,466
This is enough. I'll print
all this now if you wish.

948
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:47,440
Then I'll give you something fresh.

949
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,500
Terrible situation!

950
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:52,890
Listen...

951
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,700
Reproach.

952
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:13,850
Lovely! Let me see.

953
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,570
I couldn't come to you

954
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:32,730
You could not reach out to me

955
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:44,710
This gulf in our love...

956
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:49,810
could not be bridged
by either of us

957
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:13,230
I remember that moment...

958
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:18,770
when I first met you

959
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:33,150
There was some sort of sign

960
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:36,116
Two hands came closer...

961
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:38,790
and things clicked

962
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:41,880
As time passed by...

963
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,900
the day set and night came on

964
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:55,770
Until now, I have not
forgotten that magical moment

965
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,170
How were we to know...

966
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:24,380
that we met
only to be separated?

967
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:38,720
Our fates had
been intertwined...

968
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:42,280
only to then be destroyed

969
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:55,630
Our garden of love
had been planted...

970
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:59,440
only to be destroyed

971
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:03,030
And it was destroyed in
such a manner that...

972
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:08,150
we could never again
manage to rebuild it

973
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:31,010
Only memories remain

974
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:36,650
Time just passes by

975
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:50,660
Flowers do bloom again...

976
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:56,260
but then they fade away again

977
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,420
Everybody goes away...

978
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:04,690
but the pain in the heart
just does not go away

979
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:08,620
Those scars that you gave me...

980
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:13,340
have still not been
erased from my heart

981
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:17,050
I could not come to you

982
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:21,860
You could not reach out to me

983
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:25,270
This gulf in our love...

984
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:30,690
could not be bridged by either of us

985
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:34,300
I could not come to you

986
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,400
You could not reach out to me

987
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:43,520
I could not come to you

988
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:53,090
I had no idea you sang so well.

989
01:40:56,160 --> 01:41:00,000
- If you don't mind, may I ask you something?
- Yes.

990
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,260
What would you do
if I wasn't a writer?

991
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:07,040
- What do you mean?
- I'm not interested in writing.

992
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:10,270
There's no fun in writing.
Take this paper, for example.

993
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:15,020
We print 2000 copies. 200 get
sold, the rest is just trash.

994
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:19,620
Who cares about writers?
But take singers.

995
01:41:26,730 --> 01:41:29,910
- They have a name, are respected.
- What are you saying?

996
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:38,850
Writers are better known.
A song dies, the singer, too, dies.

997
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:43,930
But literature always lives!
And the writer lives with it.

998
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:46,250
Forget about becoming a singer.

999
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,800
All right. As you wish.

1000
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,820
Sing that song for me.

1001
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:56,460
- Which one?
- The one you were writing.

1002
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:00,560
I haven't finished it.
I'll recite it tomorrow.

1003
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:03,060
All right.

1004
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,770
When you drink water,
your head remains cool.

1005
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:20,710
Drinking coffee heats your head.

1006
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:23,500
- Shall I get water?
- No! We don't want anything!

1007
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:27,340
I'm standing there.
Call if you need me.

1008
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,920
You're a good writer.
For God's sake, give me a song.

1009
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,940
You want a poem and
I'm stuck on the painting!

1010
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,480
Ranjit will paint it for you.

1011
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:44,730
You paint for him and
he'll write a song for me.

1012
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:48,530
I'll paint for him and
he'll write for you.

1013
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:52,340
Your job will be done but
who will make me sing?

1014
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:58,380
Everybody can cry and sing. I'll
show you a way that you can sing!

1015
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:01,110
Tell me! Fast!

1016
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:04,490
Make her sit in the drawing
room and go to the bathroom.

1017
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:06,520
Everyone can sing in the bathroom.

1018
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,190
- What nonsense!
- Nonsense?

1019
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:14,930
You won't sing.
Then his painting won't be done.

1020
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:18,430
And I won't get a song. Had it!

1021
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:22,420
What, sir! I won't let you die.

1022
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:26,790
I'll tell you. You
teach him to write.

1023
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:29,500
You teach him to sing.

1024
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:33,030
You teach him to paint.

1025
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,480
That means we learn
each others' jobs.

1026
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,830
Yes. How is the idea?

1027
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:45,020
Terrific! What an idea!

1028
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:48,670
- You're fantastic!
- Live long!

1029
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:54,140
- When your job is done...
- Teach you something!

1030
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:58,110
Yes, straight...

1031
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:10,480
You can't draw a straight line
How will you paint?

1032
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:13,560
- Why else are you my teacher?
- What a student!

1033
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:18,030
You keep drawing straight lines
I'll practice my song.

1034
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:25,130
Good. Sleeping, crying...

1035
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:28,470
Eating, drinking...

1036
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:38,680
Kallu, fatso was sleeping.

1037
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:42,510
The dog kicked him.
And he was crying.

1038
01:44:47,470 --> 01:44:48,770
Doesn't sound good.

1039
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:52,420
Terrible situation!

1040
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:25,790
Madam...

1041
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:29,120
- Any news of him?
- No, madam.

1042
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:34,220
I asked all the sign board
painters but no sign of him!

1043
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:44,270
The writer, he writes.

1044
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:50,670
Newspaper, he comes here?

1045
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,740
Where is he?

1046
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:58,130
No idea? Really?

1047
01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:13,210
- Any news of him?
- No.

1048
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:17,830
I inquired from big singers
but there's no sign of him.

1049
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:20,690
God knows where he has gone.

1050
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:25,700
Each moment without him
is difficult.

1051
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:37,230
My veena (musical instrument)
weeps in your absence

1052
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,610
Oh my love, my love, my love

1053
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,670
My veena weeps in your absence

1054
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:09,340
My beloved, to which place
have you now gone?

1055
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,760
I know not the
name of that place

1056
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:23,060
When this wretched loneliness
will end for me, I know not

1057
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:28,580
Oh, when are we
going to meet again?

1058
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:34,280
My love, my love, my love

1059
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:38,950
My veena weeps in your absence

1060
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:55,670
Without you,
my songs are incomplete

1061
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:59,820
They are shy to escape my lips

1062
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:06,240
I try to play
but the strings do not play

1063
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:09,860
They just keep suffering in agony

1064
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:15,140
Nobody understands my pain

1065
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:20,780
My love, my love, my love

1066
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:25,600
My veena weeps in your absence

1067
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:30,750
It weeps, it weeps

1068
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:47,490
With my tears, I have
made a portrait of yours

1069
01:49:55,770 --> 01:50:03,610
My continuous tears have created
the destiny of my love

1070
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:07,820
With my tears, I have...

1071
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:31,860
Taking tears from my eyes,
and with a loving gaze...

1072
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:39,800
and with blood from my heart,
I have drawn out the sketch

1073
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:48,280
I have sworn that
I will meet you again

1074
01:50:56,730 --> 01:51:04,500
My continuous tears have created
the destiny of my love

1075
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:08,710
With my tears, I have...

1076
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:32,860
When these beautiful spring nights
torture my heart...

1077
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:40,900
I will, in my loneliness,
talk a little to your portrait

1078
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:49,440
A mad lover has
now closed herself

1079
01:51:57,710 --> 01:52:05,650
My continuous tears have created
the destiny of my love

1080
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:13,690
With my tears, I have
made a portrait of yours

1081
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:17,670
With my tears, I have...

1082
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,700
My love, my love

1083
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:36,200
My veena weeps in your absence

1084
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:41,900
My love, my love, my love

1085
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,930
There will be no bitterness

1086
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:20,870
There will be no complaint or bitterness

1087
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:25,850
I have only one small request...

1088
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:33,040
that you would be kind
enough to listen to me

1089
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:46,150
Whether you love me
or reject me...

1090
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:51,230
I am one of those
madly in love with you

1091
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:56,640
Even if you do not
make me yours...

1092
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:02,070
don't think I do not love you

1093
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:22,990
I do not have a
problem with dying...

1094
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:28,070
but I live on with this one hope

1095
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:46,950
Maybe my name does figure,
even by mistake, in your writings

1096
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:53,790
Whether you love me
or reject me...

1097
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:58,970
I am one of those
madly in love with you

1098
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:19,780
I am gradually losing myself
bit by bit

1099
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:24,800
I am burning from within
and not just once

1100
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:40,230
I have the strength
of a flame of fire...

1101
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:45,190
but I live among the moths
that circle the flame

1102
01:55:55,660 --> 01:56:00,260
Whether you love me
or reject me...

1103
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:05,160
I am one of those
madly in love with you

1104
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:18,110
My love, my love

1105
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:27,920
My veena weeps in your absence

1106
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:33,550
My love, my love, my love

1107
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:15,150
The heart is breaking.
Today you could have kept it.

1108
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:23,820
Today, even sorrow is fading.
You could have at least come today.

1109
01:57:35,730 --> 01:57:39,100
- Lost something?
- Yes.

1110
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:42,980
Even I have lost it.

1111
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:54,540
Come, looking for something?

1112
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:58,940
- Yes.
- Sit. We'll search together.

1113
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:11,550
Earlier we had nothing.
Then we find it and lose everything.

1114
01:58:12,610 --> 01:58:16,380
The beginning, middle and end.

1115
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:22,900
- Then end.
- You're worried about your story. I'm worried to death!

1116
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:26,040
Can't sleep all night.

1117
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:31,210
I've had fits seven times a day!

1118
01:58:33,370 --> 01:58:37,480
It's when the heroine experiences
sorrow, pain is created in the story.

1119
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:41,690
- Haven't you seen any films lately?
- No.

1120
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:46,030
Take any film. When the
heroine is in this state...

1121
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,750
she sings a song. Sad song.

1122
01:58:52,470 --> 01:59:00,470
Yes. I don't know why, but I, too,
sang a painful song this morning.

1123
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,480
Really?

1124
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:07,070
Strange! I sang one, too.

1125
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:11,600
- You too?
- Yes.

1126
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:15,580
- Full of pathos?
- Yes.

1127
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:18,810
I also sang.

1128
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:24,200
Our stories are unfolding well.

1129
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:29,300
- Shall I get water?
- Water won't do today.

1130
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:35,380
The pain is too much.
Get coffee. Hot coffee!

1131
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:50,360
How many more cups of coffee
will you make us drink?

1132
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:52,760
We must do something!

1133
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,790
- If he isn't found...
- Don't say that...

1134
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:00,000
or I'll get a fit right here.

1135
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:05,690
I'm sure you know him.
He would come here daily!

1136
02:00:06,350 --> 02:00:11,370
Yes madam. Black coffee,
hot coffee and cold coffee.

1137
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:21,060
Where are they?

1138
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:25,370
Here is the painter.

1139
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:31,930
This is the cold coffee guy. Writer.

1140
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:36,190
- And him?
- The hot coffee guy?

1141
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:40,580
This is him. Singer.

1142
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:45,480
He would sing, bang on
this table and break them.

1143
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:51,360
And these are their bills. Unpaid.

1144
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:56,560
They do not owe anyone anything.
The world owes them a lot.

1145
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:00,360
You don't know how
great an artist he is!

1146
02:01:21,510 --> 02:01:27,020
The gent would recite poems in
Hindi and madam does it in English.

1147
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,700
- You can do one thing.
- What?

1148
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:37,486
Marry them as soon as they come.

1149
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:38,610
Marriage?

1150
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:48,870
Those three men have brains
and you women have hearts.

1151
02:01:49,150 --> 02:01:53,480
If you don't keep them tied,
they might do anything.

1152
02:01:53,790 --> 02:01:57,720
They can leave you.
They can commit suicide!

1153
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:03,150
Arrange for the wedding
before they commit suicide.

1154
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:09,260
- The idea is good.
- Give your consent.

1155
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:14,610
My view is the same as the public.

1156
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:19,020
The public is supreme
in Janata Coffee House.

1157
02:02:19,150 --> 02:02:21,350
Make arrangements for the weddings.

1158
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:23,510
Come on.

1159
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:33,850
Father, these are my friends.
They've come to meet you.

1160
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:37,090
- This is Kalpana and Geeta.
- Good day.

1161
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:47,990
- Sit down girls.
- We haven't come to sit!

1162
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:50,870
- We've come to fight!
- To fight?

1163
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:54,410
- What's my fault?
- Serious fault!

1164
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:59,760
- Have you seen her face?
- Right from her birth.

1165
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:04,320
Look carefully. Face is red.

1166
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,780
Eyes are popping out!

1167
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:12,340
Her cheeks are puffing.
She's becoming fatter by the day.

1168
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:15,660
You are right. I'll call
the doctor immediately.

1169
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:17,860
He'll give her vitamin shots.

1170
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,500
Both of you go out.

1171
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:32,340
- Vitamins won't work.
- Then?

1172
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:34,810
Get her married.

1173
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:40,690
Good idea. I'll place an
advertisement in the paper.

1174
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:44,050
There'll be a queue of boys.

1175
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,430
You don't have to do that.
We've found her a groom.

1176
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:54,600
- Who is he?
- You know him.

1177
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:58,100
I know him? Who?

1178
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:05,150
- The painter, your tenant.
- Painter? He's a good boy!

1179
02:04:05,530 --> 02:04:09,170
That's why I gave up
his six months rent.

1180
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:15,290
If I knew my daughter was marrying
him, I'd will this house to him.

1181
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:18,490
Really? Come on!

1182
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:26,840
I've fixed your marriage. Happy?

1183
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:34,540
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

1184
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,150
- And you?
- No.

1185
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:44,080
You're worried about Rekha's
wedding, not about your own?

1186
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:49,340
Do you know Geeta gets
fits day and night.

1187
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:56,400
Fans herself all day.
And sighs all night.

1188
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,130
- And you?
- I...

1189
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:04,210
She goes to his office all day.

1190
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,070
- Really?
- Yes, uncle.

1191
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:11,450
Drinks cold coffee all day
and darkens paper!

1192
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:15,120
Understood. But why
don't you get married?

1193
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,980
- Who will talk to my mother?
- I'll talk dear.

1194
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:24,840
- And you?
- I have neither mother nor father.

1195
02:05:25,090 --> 02:05:28,220
What am I here for?
I'll arrange for your wedding.

1196
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:30,900
You all are my daughters. Come on.

1197
02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:43,670
Mother is inside.

1198
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:55,890
- Are you Geeta's mother?
- I'm not so lucky.

1199
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:57,860
I have no children.

1200
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,630
I am Geeta's father.

1201
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:08,630
What? I'm her mother!

1202
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:14,980
I'm Rekha's father not Geeta's.
Both are alike for me.

1203
02:06:18,110 --> 02:06:21,450
Yes, Rekha is an old
friend of Geeta's.

1204
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:28,120
I'm glad to meet you.
Don't stand. Please take a seat.

1205
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:33,380
- What can I do for you?
- That's what I've come for.

1206
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:37,590
- Do you know Geeta?
- Won't I know her?

1207
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:40,850
- She's my child.
- Yet you don't know her.

1208
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:44,540
Rekha told me Geeta gets fits.

1209
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:49,210
She sighs at nights, cries
day and night and fans herself!

1210
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:52,280
And you sit and split betel nut!

1211
02:06:52,790 --> 02:06:58,010
- What can I do?
- Marry her off. Right away.

1212
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:01,860
I'd like to do that.

1213
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:06,230
- Do you know Mohan?
- Yes, he lives below.

1214
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:11,230
That's the boy for Geeta.
They love each other.

1215
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:15,240
Get them married.
Do you understand?

1216
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:21,080
They'll make a good pair.
If Geeta married him...

1217
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:23,350
I'll listen to hymns every day.

1218
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:26,210
He sings very well!

1219
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:30,550
I fall asleep every
afternoon listening to him.

1220
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:40,840
- Done.
- Really?

1221
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:45,170
Your job is done, yours is done...

1222
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:48,870
- Now you're left.
- Father, I'm Rekha!

1223
02:07:48,950 --> 02:07:51,940
I'm fixed. She is left.

1224
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:57,610
You're left? Doesn't matter.
Now we'll fix yours too.

1225
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:14,800
- Who is this?
- My elder brother.

1226
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:17,380
Elder brother!

1227
02:08:22,410 --> 02:08:25,560
- Play a game?
- Don't you have anything to do but play ball?

1228
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:29,180
Turned your house into a field!
Think you are a great player!

1229
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:30,990
No concern for your sister?

1230
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:33,510
She's an adult.
Can look after herself.

1231
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:36,390
What are you here for?
Do you know...

1232
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:41,040
- she walks around his office all day!
- Good exercise!

1233
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:44,510
- Drinks cold coffee.
- Keeps the mind cool.

1234
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:47,090
- Blackens paper.
- Helps pass time.

1235
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:49,330
Aren't you worried about her marriage?

1236
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:53,490
How can I worry about hers
when I don't care about mine?

1237
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:57,640
You're her elder brother.
You must get her married.

1238
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:01,440
She can get married to
anyone. Whenever she wishes.

1239
02:09:01,670 --> 02:09:05,170
I'll host a test match
to celebrate her wedding.

1240
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:08,810
You organize the match.
I'll organize the wedding.

1241
02:09:13,290 --> 02:09:15,740
There, your job too is done.

1242
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:21,230
I'll give an application for
your weddings in the court.

1243
02:09:22,570 --> 02:09:24,690
Will we get married in court?

1244
02:09:25,370 --> 02:09:27,340
Do people get married
or sued in courts?

1245
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:32,460
Marriage, compromise, cases,
everything is done in courts.

1246
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:36,210
Won't there be music
at our wedding?

1247
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:40,610
I'll have a band playing.

1248
02:09:41,090 --> 02:09:44,580
Your marriage will be grand.

1249
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:30,860
We are crazy birds

1250
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:37,010
We have one tune

1251
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,670
We have one destination

1252
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:41,230
We are crazy about love

1253
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:07,660
Leaving this earth behind...

1254
02:11:08,170 --> 02:11:11,480
we have to go beyond the clouds

1255
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:26,420
Picking out beautiful
stars in the sky...

1256
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,030
we have to build our own nest

1257
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:32,790
We have one focus

1258
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:34,650
We have one sense of fun

1259
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:37,000
We have the same tales to tell

1260
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:41,250
We are crazy birds

1261
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:03,630
Now that we have
set out together...

1262
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:07,330
we will definitely
find our destination

1263
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:22,040
The heart where we are
to make our homes...

1264
02:12:22,450 --> 02:12:25,650
we will definitely
find that heart

1265
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:30,180
We crazy people have
set out today...

1266
02:12:30,340 --> 02:12:32,630
to set up a new
world for ourselves

1267
02:12:34,030 --> 02:12:36,790
We are crazy birds

1268
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:43,306
We have one tune

1269
02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:45,010
We have one destination

1270
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:47,510
We are crazy about love

1271
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,410
No, this won't do.

1272
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:20,820
Definitely not!

1273
02:13:21,070 --> 02:13:24,960
We must keep them in the dark.
We must tell the truth!

1274
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:28,910
If they find out the truth,
they won't want to see us again.

1275
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:32,000
Lord! You tell us what to do.

1276
02:13:33,890 --> 02:13:37,560
Let things go on as they are.
We'll see after the wedding.

1277
02:13:37,790 --> 02:13:39,850
But they can leave us
after the wedding too.

1278
02:13:40,530 --> 02:13:43,610
How will they go?
We'll hold their legs!

1279
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:45,570
- We'll fall at their feet?
- Why not?

1280
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:50,260
They'll be the legs of our wives, not
strangers! We can always hold them.

1281
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:54,100
- Won't you feel ashamed?
- Why?

1282
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:57,230
There was a time when
women fell at men's feet.

1283
02:13:57,710 --> 02:14:00,200
Today man can fall at her feet.

1284
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:05,150
May I tell you something?
Everyone acts smart outside.

1285
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:08,840
But at home all men
fall at their wives' feet!

1286
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,400
- Good day.
- Good day son. Sit down.

1287
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:23,150
- Good day.
- Bless you.

1288
02:14:24,170 --> 02:14:25,570
- Good day.
- Bless you.

1289
02:14:28,070 --> 02:14:29,370
Who are you?

1290
02:14:31,510 --> 02:14:34,980
- He's with us.
- I see. Come in.

1291
02:14:46,730 --> 02:14:53,410
Friends, today you are with me
in the most happy day of life.

1292
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:57,660
I thank you for the same.

1293
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:04,080
My only dream in life was
to get my daughter married.

1294
02:15:05,310 --> 02:15:11,110
And today my three daughters,
not just one, are getting married!

1295
02:15:12,470 --> 02:15:16,350
In my eyes Kalpana and
Geeta are the same as Rekha.

1296
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,020
They, too, are my girls.

1297
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:24,690
And today under my roof,
by my own hands...

1298
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:30,660
all three girls will settle down.

1299
02:15:33,310 --> 02:15:34,710
Where are the girls?

1300
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:03,390
Why are you sitting here?
You sit there.

1301
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:06,900
Are you marrying him or the painter?

1302
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:11,330
- He is the painter.
- Don't I know him? Come on.

1303
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:17,150
Why are you sitting here? Get up.

1304
02:16:18,630 --> 02:16:23,010
What are you doing father?
He's the painter not him.

1305
02:16:23,070 --> 02:16:26,620
Don't I know the painter?
Aren't you the painter?

1306
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:29,390
Didn't I excuse your rent?

1307
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:31,396
Yes.

1308
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:36,960
Yes madam, black coffee.
He sits and drinks black coffee.

1309
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:38,980
And makes pictures.

1310
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:44,440
Mother!

1311
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:50,120
- Then who are you?
- Writer.

1312
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:55,290
Yes madam. Cold coffee.

1313
02:16:55,360 --> 02:17:00,610
He sits in Janata Coffee House,
drinks cold coffee and writes poems!

1314
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:02,159
Writes poems?

1315
02:17:04,830 --> 02:17:07,260
You might as well tell us who you are.

1316
02:17:09,070 --> 02:17:11,430
I'm a born singer.

1317
02:17:14,709 --> 02:17:17,319
They have deceived us!

1318
02:17:17,719 --> 02:17:20,109
- We won't marry them!
- Never!

1319
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:45,880
Terrible situation!

1320
02:18:22,190 --> 02:18:27,690
Carbuncles erupted in the
heart because of the bruise.

1321
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:33,039
The house caught fire
by its very own lamp.

1322
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:48,430
- Now what will happen?
- Where will we go?

1323
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:58,100
Good day madams. Hot or cold?

1324
02:19:58,640 --> 02:19:59,940
We want nothing!

1325
02:20:02,010 --> 02:20:04,840
- Don't you like hot coffee?
- No.

1326
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:09,790
Don't you like cold coffee?

1327
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:16,010
- Don't you like black coffee?
- Not one bit!

1328
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:20,780
Then you love the men's work,
not them.

1329
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:26,100
- You wanted to marry a writer?
- Yes.

1330
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:29,160
The writer is sitting there.

1331
02:20:31,780 --> 02:20:33,180
You can marry him.

1332
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:39,290
Do you want to marry a painter?

1333
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:43,070
The painter is sitting there.

1334
02:20:45,850 --> 02:20:47,840
- You may marry him.
- Scoot!

1335
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:54,320
- You want the singer?
- Yes.

1336
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:56,460
There he is.

1337
02:21:00,770 --> 02:21:01,970
Marry him.

1338
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:12,030
You love neither the men
nor their professions.

1339
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:16,310
I'm telling you ladies,
forget your heads.

1340
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:20,240
Follow your heart.
Forget the professions.

1341
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:24,650
Marry your loved ones
or you'll live to regret it.

1342
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:28,620
What he says is right.

1343
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:34,800
A singer can be as good
as an artist or a writer.

1344
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:38,670
Then a writer can't be
worse than a painter.

1345
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:42,100
A painter isn't worse than a singer.

1346
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:11,870
Now there's nothing to worry about!

1347
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:15,750
The ladies will pay the
bills of these gentlemen!

1348
02:22:19,210 --> 02:22:20,910
Quiet!

1349
02:22:23,470 --> 02:22:28,300
The three girls left the Janata
Coffee House and entered their homes.

1350
02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:31,090
This was a victory
of the heart over the brain.

1351
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:36,260
For the first time woman
realized you love by your heart.

1352
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:41,560
Before, what she considered
to be love was a deception.

1353
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:43,660
Subterfuge! Mental illusion!

1354
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:45,500
Excellent!

1355
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:48,740
Sir, you are absolutely right.

1356
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:53,480
You're not the only one to say this.
Even Saint Kabir said this...

1357
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:56,480
What runs is a vehicle.

1358
02:22:57,080 --> 02:23:00,520
Boiled milk is condensed.

1359
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:03,250
That which is colored
is called an orange.

1360
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:06,280
Thus cried Kabira!
