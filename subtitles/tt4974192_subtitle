00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:39,943
Ficket... Ticket...

2
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:45,507
(Crowd munnuring)

3
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,634

Stop has reached, Get down Get down

00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:10,403
Make it Fast.

6
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,865
Move, move, move away

7
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:08,030
What 7 What happened?

8
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:11,066
We have rescued some but the flow is very high now.

9
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:13,840
Don't worry. Vasu have already trying.

10
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,703
Who? Our Vasu?

11
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:15,810
Yes.. yes ..

12
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,067
Bring ,Bring ,Hold.

13
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,150
Prakasanm, son of the LIC agent is still missing.

14
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,017
We have searched everywhere but still...

15
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,961
We can't get back to the river now ,it's too danger...

16
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:06,722
He might have got trapped in the bus itself.

17
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,158
But how we will find him?

18
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:14,163
Vasu...!

19
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:19,400
It's not sure that the kid is in the bus itself ,if not?

20
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,635
What if he is there?

21
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:32,155
VasumVasu...

22
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:36,987
Prakasan, tell him to come back,
the son of LIC agent is here with me.

23
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:40,460
Vasu... Vasu...

24
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,596

00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:46,000
Vasu... Vasu...

26
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,929
Come back, come back

27
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:35,212
Vasu's son have been waiting
for his return, No one came

28
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:40,716
The society took over the family of Vasu the one who
sacrificed his own life for rescuing someone else,

29
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:44,680
Everybody called him Vasu's 'Kuttan'
and later it became 'Vasoottan'

30
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:48,853
The story of 'Vasoottan' Starts here!

31
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:51,926
20 years later...

32
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:56,822
Daughter 7 Should I call the taxi 7 it's
your interview ,don't make it late

33
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,628
Why dad 7 Vasoottan told that he will reach on time

34
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:02,897
Please find a solution for this and go !!!!

35
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:05,233
Yea right!!! Police jeep is to

36
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:06,576
Then what to do 7??

37
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:12,281
Vasoottan will do the needed, after the transfer
he was the one who is looking up on everything.

38
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,580
Sir what happened 7 Should we
take the note book to school 7

39
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:17,319
It was long before that students
did home works in note book...

40
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,147
...now they are making new things
,stitching clothes ,making sack...

41
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:25,853
...and even he have been asked grow up
plants and my son has planted coconut tree.

42
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,092
You don't worry Nasoottan will deal it cleanly.

43
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:34,101
Did Saritha went 7 Yes of course ,when the
media got new news all those have vanished.

44
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:35,638
Not that , Did Saritha Bus went 7

45
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:42,278
No.. No.. Nasoottan has not yet gone,
after Vasoottan only Saritha will go...

46
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:12,142

I will go with him without any hesitation.

Before inventing mobile phone you started your love
now 3G changed to 4G still you are not together.

00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,765
What should I do 7 if call her out,
then the fight will start here itself.

54
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:38,032
You have been Roaming around as a Thug few
months before and you are worried it seems!

55
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:39,293
You think this is the same?

56
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:42,936
Sabu, Hitting is not what we bring from the sky...

57
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,135
...yesterday someone got it a
nd today we will give this people.

Go and bring her, do what we
should never mind the result. ok

00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:03,149
If you go with this thug...

61
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:05,990
He stopped all those bad habits
and started a new shop in the town.

62
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:07,230
So you will go 7

63
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,062
Yea, I have been waiting for
this moment till last 10-12 years.

00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:11,826
If you get aged also I wont; let you go...

65
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,831

67
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:16,265

There is too many tools in my auto, ok

76
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:55,871
But I don't need any of that
because my tool is this one...

77
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:02,169
All the thug leaders numbers are
saved in this and just a call away.

78
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:16,991
Should I call 7

79
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:23,138
Don't make me to be the second face uncle

80
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,238

81
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,274
Do you have all those numbers 7

82
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:35,180
Where 7 even if those contacts are there,
I don't have enough balance to call.

83
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:36,509
Best !!!!

84
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,257
Its all a Confidence, if you have it you can do
it but if you don't have it nothing will happen.

85
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,293
You are so great ...Great

86
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:48,428

87
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,183
So this is Vasoottan's home? right 7

88
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:44,691
Sabuvetta there are some who don't even look
back on friends after marriage, are you like that?

89
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,771
No... Not at all

90
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,067
What 7 you should be like that only !!!

91
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:56,806
I don't have anyone else you should be
with me every time , if not I will suicide.

92
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:03,751
I'll show you if you say anymore
about your friends and Vasoottan.

93
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,157
From the time we started our love I
have been hearing the same name always..

94
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:09,384
...and I have taken up the decision that time
itself that I will stop it after marriage.

95
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:12,286
He was the one who made us together

96
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:17,560
So what? You married me orVasoottan?
Be with me then. I don't have anyone...

97
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:25,173
So that's why friends gifted me Reeth on wedding.

98
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:28,204
Hey, go home and flirt each other.

99
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:29,770
Prakashettaaa...

100
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:31,339
You are also invited for the wedding treat 7

101
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,577
There should be someone from society to
treat the guys who ran away and got married 7

102
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,414
But you are from Calicut 7

103
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:40,790
Do you know 7 it's been 30 years
that I been here in Vadakancherry

104
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:43,518
But still you use the Calicut slang while talking.

105
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,489
If we say BiriyanLYou will say kozhikode biriyani

106
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,188
if its auto ,then kozhikode auto

107
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,190
Tell me the truth ,You got
kicked out from Kozhikode right 7

108
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,136
You...!!! Girl you know? He w as 24x7 with Vasoottan
before marriage, I hope that will change from now.

109
00:17:57,296 --> 00:18:03,269
No... no... , why should he change 7 it should be
the way it was because Vasukutan made us together.

110
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:05,377
See , You are

111
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:06,412
Lucky right 7

112
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:14,189
There are some girls who won't let their husband to
be with friends not even allow to call their friends!!!

113
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:16,257
Seriously 7 those kind of girls still exist on earth 7

114
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:20,429
Only few

115
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:23,367
All you three came along ?

116
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:26,267
I got him from the gate, where is your Mother 7

117
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,368
Sit here, I will call her and come.

118
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:30,434
Wait I will join you. I want to see that machine I sold.

119
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,537
You sold it 7 How much did you take commission?

120
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,675
It was a used one

121
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,513
reached 7

122
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,578
Too good ,everything happened fine right 7

123
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:46,618
No more problems to arise 7

124
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,625
What problems, nothing ..

125
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:54,186
They have not grown up to make
fight in our Vadakancherry town

126
00:18:55,821 --> 00:18:58,893
Mother 7 You changed the soap name again?

127
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,732
It's very easy in this machine to change names.

128
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:06,401
Prakashettaa, the name
keeps on changing weekly

129
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,438
Son... this is the new trend.

130
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,441
Even our Marketing wing have suggested the same.

131
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:14,577
After all how is the Machine 7

132
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:20,289
It has a small problem, I thought I will say it later.

133
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,250
Whats the problem now 7

134
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,186
Sometimes there won't be soap inside the cover

135
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:28,927
Its thick cover and direct
packing so we might miss in between

136
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:31,198
<i>mats a Big task</i>

137
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:32,900
It happens once in a hundred

138
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,305
We have to check each one

139
00:19:35,494 --> 00:19:38,202
When we bought there was no problem?

140
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,402
There is corruption behind this sale

141
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,344
Call the seller company and ask.

142
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:44,241
Yea , I will call now itself ,I cant take this silly

143
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:46,475
No need,We have to treat
the newly wedded couple.

144
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:52,278
Wait Wait,give way

145
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:56,884
Hows it 7 The heavy ones won't move

146
00:19:57,816 --> 00:19:58,624
Son very good

147
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,361
Too nice Idea

148
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,289
I have read this somewhere before.

149
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:06,898
No use until you make it practical.

150
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,795
Vasoottan... you saved my dignity.

151
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:10,840
Anyways, call the company and correct it soon.

152
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,569
That I will manage.

153
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:14,309
Let's have food now.

154
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,509
When will he get married 7

155
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,314
Let him be free

156
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:23,381
You are not liking the way I enjoy life , right 7

157
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,328
Where you want to go 7

158
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:38,327
Brother, Railway station 7

159
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:39,533
Step in.

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,501
Or no need, Taxi stand 7

161
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:46,338
Tell me a specific place.

162
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:48,309
Its so tough to go to two places at same time

163
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:52,744
I might miss the train that's why.

164
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:54,814
Whats the time now 7

165
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:56,612

166
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:01,347
- Still,You are new to this place Right ?
-yes

167
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:04,389

Will take this right.

171
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:34,950
Daughters are you fine?

172
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:35,991

Oh I don't need it anyways.

214
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:55,752
Still better than keeping your own name for auto.

215
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:58,655
Who was that girl 7

216
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,660

A girl enquired about him.

234
00:25:58,677 --> 00:25:59,178
Who was that girl 7

235
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:01,216
Not a girl,A lady.

236
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:04,157
She even asked about these
pictures and about his family too.

237
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:06,219

Dad warned me not to ask any detail

242
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:18,032
Thats because asked Name and
Number of that college students.

He and his mobile ,Every time looking in that.

244
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:26,776
Dad and son have started fighting
on silly things , leave it anyways .

245
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:30,285
Still ,Who will be that lady
who asked about Vasoottan?

246
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:35,218
Who will be that 7

247
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:38,058
Rameshan... come here,

250
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:46,126
This is to Kodaikanal for a mushroom trip, coming 7

251
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:49,201

00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:51,104
Why did you call 7

253
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:55,243
There was a gin searching for
Vasoottan, too beautiful girl

00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:56,706
Girl!!! Who is she 7

255
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:59,312
I have told her about Vasoottan ,whatever I knows.

256
00:26:59,905 --> 00:27:00,645
You didn't ask her the details?

257
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:01,850
She was not letting me know ..

258
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:04,053
Who is that 7

259
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,785
Who was that 7

260
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:09,114
It can be too many people ,because
I always do good for others .

261
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:10,957
How?

262
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:16,966
It can be Radhika ,who got job in
interview as I dropped her there.

263
00:27:17,322 --> 00:27:20,860
Or it can be that teacher who stays near George sir.

264
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,072
Still how she reached my studio 7

265
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:33,745
Guys , this is the girl which I saw in the railway
cross, there was a spark when I saw her first

266
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:37,053
These girls are so silly.

267
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:38,819
Is she trying to make a problem 7

268
00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:41,452

269
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,091
Still why no gin is searching for me 7

270
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:48,162
Rameshan, you have to drive auto too
see all these ,you are always on trip .

271
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,227
I am not 'Rameshan' I am 'Ram.'

272
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,262
Not Ram ,its Haram(things should not be done)

273
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:54,895
still who is that 7

274
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:59,438
You only have this to think about or what 7

275
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,410
Who is calling!!!

276
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:06,182

279
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:15,421

281
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:24,933

282
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,368
Who was it 7

283
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:28,838
The girl whom I dropped at station.

284
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,104
What was the matter 7

285
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:31,965

For what?

289
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:39,778
She told she will send the address and
she will be waiting for me it seems.

290
00:28:40,238 --> 00:28:41,216
Didn't she tell the Matter 7

291
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:43,110
No..

292
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:45,218
This is to show you to her family
as she wanted to marry you .

293
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,220
Seriously 7

294
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:49,759
She might have thought about me actually
and by mistake his name would have come

295
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:51,991
No am sure she is waiting for me only.

296
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:57,157
Go man, Yesterday you people met,today they enquired
and today itself they are bringing the proposal 7

297
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:58,324
There is something wrong going around.

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,460
Bet for 500 Rs 7

299
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:02,096

300
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:07,903
Am pretty sure about this .

301
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:10,337
If you believe in his words and
go, then you will get trapped.

302
00:29:10,936 --> 00:29:14,179
Vasoottan, you should go at least for this bet .

303
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,149
Bet confinned for 500 Rs

304
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:49,151
Surroundings are all calm...

Was it tough to find address 7

308
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:30,088
I have been through this roads before.

309
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:34,091
My job is that only, we wont
forget the way we pass once.

310
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:35,896
Then I will call her !!!

311
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:37,463
Paaru !!!

312
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:41,969
Ohh! I forgot ,she doesn't like
calling her 'Paaru' in front of others.

313
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,834
Where did she went now 7

314
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:45,073
Just a minute ,she will come now.

315
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,500
Okay

00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:07,021
Sabu ,you won the bet brother!!!!

319
00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:17,132
She told the story how you dropped
her on time at railway station.

320
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:18,337
Its all just..

321
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:27,177
And the quote you said was too impressive!

322
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,519
We were searching for a Guy like you!!!

323
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:34,350
But I don't have much education and all !!

324
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:43,964
We already enquired everything about
you, Everybody has respect for you .

325
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:47,997
These people always talks about me ,ohh..

326
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,639
So we came to know about you so fast.

327
00:31:52,564 --> 00:31:56,307
We hope Vasoottan will help us
too as you do help for everyone.

328
00:31:58,436 --> 00:32:05,615
Hope you will help us, if not
we will have to commit suicide, .

329
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:07,984
Whats the matter 7

330
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:11,351
That's why I called you up to talk

331
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:14,658
Oh ,for That you called !!!

332
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:19,225
Actually what's the problem 7

333
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:20,492
I will tell you all the details now.

334
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:25,334
All we have is this house and the fann around.

335
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,179
Paru was studying for MBA and she did
her internship at a shipping company

336
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:34,147
She got some order from the
company for our fann products

337
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:37,246
All the fonnalities have
been done ,see the documents

338
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:41,619
Two things before signing,..

339
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,663
Your farm doesn't have export license so whole
amount should be given as bank guarantee,"

340
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:59,136
...the things should happen at exact date,
otherwise you will lose the guarantee too.

341
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:09,713
Still we took the order because we already
have connected to all those merchants here.

342
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:16,517
We didn't look back ,we showed the order
details and took loan from Co-Operative bank.

343
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:22,115
"But after that all of them changed
their words. We were totally trapped.

344
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:32,007
The days passed.

345
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:37,241
We had a doubt

346
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:38,679
Who is that 7

347
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:41,139
Dad didn't believe at first ,Later he understood

348
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:43,242
Sreedharan...

349
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:46,021
The neighbour was the one behind all
these problems, even he owns a farm house.

350
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:47,346
I can't win against him alone

351
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:50,726
Date is over and the order is cancelled.

352
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:53,126
Bank is threatening that they will Mortgage our house

353
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:58,225
<i>Yesterday Pam went to meet MLA,</i>

354
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,796
With his party hold,We have got
about 12 days grace period now.

355
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:14,345
That is the deadline otherwise we
will lose our house and everything.

356
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:18,520
If so we Wont live after that, we will suicide together:

357
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:23,824
We will fight against Sreedharan
and will get 100 items for the order.

358
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,527
Vasoottan please help us !!!

359
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:34,568

361
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:39,669

362
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,167
Sudha, bring it here

363
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:21,579
Ha Ha Ha... You should get this trouble...

364
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:24,275
Are you going to marry the goat 7

365
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:27,213
First time am laughing after loosing in a Bet.

366
00:35:27,779 --> 00:35:29,884
Don't forget to give the bet amount.

367
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:31,123
No ,I wont forget.

368
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,523
Then what happened?

369
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:40,632
If we complete the deal, we will
have good benefit through commission.

370
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:42,430
What did you say last to them 7

371
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:45,435
I told, I will think about it and tell

372
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:50,774
That was good move ,Even if we get commission,
this doesn't seems so easy to accomplish

373
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:54,280
Why should we gain someones
curse without doing hann!!

374
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:58,346
So I will call them at evening and
tell that "we can't work it out "

375
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:04,888
Hey Vasoottan, No need to convey through phone

376
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:09,158
That will hurt the whole family.

377
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:12,429
We should go directly and say, I will also come.

378
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:15,736
Is it 7
-Yes

379
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:19,274
So tomorrow I will accompany you

380
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,599
Tomorrow I wont be able to come.

381
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:23,803
Did somebody Invited you 7 Ha Ha ..

382
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:37,318
He can only compete with Sreedharan.

383
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:46,634
He didn't call up yet, I don't think he can do this.

384
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:56,310
The notice which came was the last one from
court, next they will evacuate us from here.

385
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:22,564
Hello, you don't sleep or what 7

386
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:27,602
Not only me, nobody is getting
sleep here for past few weeks ..

387
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,374
Why didn't you call my dad 7

388
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,747
I thought I will come and meet tomorrow.

389
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:37,647
Hope you won't say 'no '.

390
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:40,013
N; like,I

391
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:49,693
Dad was my hero from childhood ,and I tried to
help him out in business and it resulted like this

392
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:53,894
I should save my Dad at any cost.

393
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:59,967
I believe that you are the only
person who could help us out.

394
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:49,088
We thought it's better to say directly than calling
up in phone , Even we are sad about yor situation

395
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:55,326
We can't...
-Can do it

396
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,028
We can do it.

397
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:08,373
People will first think about suicide
when they have Debt or disease.

398
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,809
There is nothing that is
impossible ,we will try and succeed.

399
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:28,962
Within 11 days, 100 Jamnapyari
will play around this house .

400
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:47,711
What happened 7 Rate confinned 7

401
00:39:48,072 --> 00:39:50,143
Little delay it seems

402
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:52,679
Delay for what 7 date was over right 7

403
00:39:53,077 --> 00:40:00,017
It was over but Ramachandren
tried through MLA and his party

404
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:07,001
They got 12 days grace period to complete order.

405
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:15,773
One guy from Vadakancherry has taken
up the order ,He is good it seems.

406
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,047
Will everything turn around '?Will the
neighbour fly with the export license!!!

407
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:30,089
No never ,there should be some provocations
in the game to make it interesting.

408
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:35,764
You follow up the co-operative Bank steps,
Correct date we should give the purchase offer too

409
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:42,734
I have attached too many fann houses before too.

410
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,901
Obviously,In my memory this is the seventh one.

411
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:46,132
Like those ,we will complete this too.

412
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:50,907
They won't get 100 jamnapyari,
whoever comes it doesn't matter.

413
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:52,740
Let them try, right 7

414
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:56,018
Let them begin

415
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:09,831
Sabuvetta, I have been waiting
for this moment so long.

416
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:11,929
Even me too.

417
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:15,129
It feels like heaven inside.
-Yes..

418
00:41:15,826 --> 00:41:18,067
But only for me !!!!

419
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:23,473
Nobody else should sit in this seat rather than me.

420
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:28,211
Even if someone steps inside,
I will make them sit behind. ok

421
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:29,784
Then it's good.

422
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:34,180
Otherwise I will keep No Entry
Board at the bedroom door.

423
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:41,097
Don't do so ,if you want I will take
this seat and keep it in our house.

424
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:43,755
Then it's ok.

425
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:46,101
We should go for many trips in this car.

426
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:51,104
Sure ,we will roam around for one
week then only we will go back home

427
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:55,507
Who is that 7

428
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:56,607
Somebody !!

429
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,618

430
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,592
Turn it friend ,Turn it around.

00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:26,037
Even I was talking about the same thing

436
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:27,039
What?

437
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:30,044
Like we all got a car to Roam around.

438
00:42:31,235 --> 00:42:32,077
Why can't you pick the call 7

439
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:33,876
I was about to..

440
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:35,312
Was that You?

441
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:37,816
I told him to pick

00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:40,180

No ,Not like that ..

445
00:42:48,052 --> 00:42:50,760
Take the car fast, will drop her and go for a tuition.

446
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,065
Tuition?

447
00:42:52,290 --> 00:43:01,938
Tuition about how to grow and feed
Jamnapyari. Class by 'AaduThoma'

448
00:43:03,701 --> 00:43:08,650
Because it was found near Yamuna
River the name came like this.

449
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:13,086
Two young farmers actually
brought this breed to Kerala.

450
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,353
Please listen...

451
00:43:18,115 --> 00:43:20,061
You take the class ,we are listening to it.

452
00:43:20,718 --> 00:43:22,789
Talk about order not about goat.

453
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:25,328
Nobody loves Goat here , I know...

454
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:31,204
Thoma likes goat from very long time, since
he was 10 years old he started being with goats

455
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:35,909
His looks states that.

456
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:39,807
We too love goat but in the
biriyani state its more loved

457
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:43,381
Jamnapyari has less cholesterol and more milk

458
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:45,918
Foreigners got to know it way back...

459
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,350
From where do we have this order 7

460
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:49,013
Finland

461
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,789
We should have 100 jamnapyari
and one special pure breed

462
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:55,124
what is that one special?

463
00:43:55,286 --> 00:44:00,065
That is in order to mate with the female goats.

464
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:03,738
High Purity Breed Jamnapyari is the technical name

465
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:06,136
We call it as the lucky one.

466
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:09,073
Will we get these 7

467
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:16,074
It's very hard to find this breed
in our state due to climate and all.

468
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,254
It is so tough to find 100 Jamnapyaris in our state.

469
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:23,358
All we have is this one.

We can't make Sreedharan sir unhappy,
he is farmers union president too.

488
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:57,814
With love am saying to withdraw
the plan... that is better

489
00:45:58,142 --> 00:46:01,453

For you everything happens according to your wish?

584
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,901
No,Not like that but that time I will
only think about things that will workout.

585
00:52:43,313 --> 00:52:46,317
Hey Vasoottan are you
falling for her dad sentiments?

586
00:52:48,485 --> 00:52:51,159
I understood from the time you took up this deal

587
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:54,263
Now everybody else came to know

588
00:52:55,258 --> 00:52:55,702
Really?

589
00:52:56,193 --> 00:52:59,265
Don't wait ,just go and tell her.

590
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:03,301
Her whole family is searching for
goats and how will I say this in between

591
00:53:05,202 --> 00:53:07,910
According to my plan within 3 to 4 days.

592
00:53:08,705 --> 00:53:12,312
Then I will go to her house with the order

593
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:20,326
how is it 7

594
00:53:20,584 --> 00:53:21,426
Good... Good...

595
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:23,297
But first you should understand her mind.

596
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,624
I will deal with it.

597
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:27,233
Tomorrow you people go together:

598
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:29,194

Go... Go... don't act over smart now.

601
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,747

So you want this goat 7

603
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,654
Yes...

604
00:53:48,378 --> 00:53:50,881
The one in this lab is the exact Jamnapyari breed

605
00:53:51,281 --> 00:53:55,388
Yea we know there will be too much fonnalities

606
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:57,264
what formalities 7

607
00:53:57,721 --> 00:54:00,600
This goat was used for
Jamnapyari Meat and Milk study

608
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:05,001
<i>Thais over now.</i>

609
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:08,567
Now the full ownership is with me.

610
00:54:09,966 --> 00:54:15,348
I can even give it now itself for you. No problem.

611
00:54:15,806 --> 00:54:16,944
Just a signature matters.

612
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,514
Thank you sir.

613
00:54:19,776 --> 00:54:20,754
But I won't sign!

614
00:54:21,311 --> 00:54:21,721
What?

615
00:54:22,045 --> 00:54:23,023
I say... I won't sign!

616
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:25,384
Why 7

617
00:54:25,882 --> 00:54:27,020
I won't sign ,that's it 7

618
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:32,397
Still why sir 7 It's a family's life.. teacher 7

619
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:38,364
Two reasons ,You didn't properly
stand up when I came inside,

620
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:39,704
Oh my God, teacher... I did..

621
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:52,979
2nd reason ,including this you
are calling me 7th time 'teacher '

622
00:54:53,944 --> 00:54:55,014
So you are not a teacher 7

623
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,355
Teachers are those who teach LP students...

624
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:07,294
...I have completed PHD, research, etc
and still you are comparing me to them.

625
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,335
Sir 7

626
00:55:08,525 --> 00:55:09,936
Enough you can leave now!!!

627
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:15,307
Teacher ,teacher we are leaving

628
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:19,373
M
m

629
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:23,080
Put more pepper when you make curry,
I will come to serve it

630
00:55:23,974 --> 00:55:24,884
Go... Go... Go...

631
00:55:26,143 --> 00:55:27,383
what kind of teacher is this 7

632
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:32,954
What kind of an animal was that !!!

633
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:35,357
Too much of ego for him

634
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:38,964
He is trying to make others respect him by
talking about himself not through his behaviour

635
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:43,933
There is a teacher at Vadakanchery high
school and the pass percentage is 100 there

636
00:55:44,394 --> 00:55:47,034
The sir will be there for teaching and for
co curricular activities at the front itself,

637
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:53,143
every one of them will stand up and
respect him when he comes through the way.

638
00:55:53,503 --> 00:55:57,076
Thats how a teacher should be.

639
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:00,053
So that way also closed !!!

640
00:56:00,677 --> 00:56:01,587
If one way closes the other way will open.

641
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:05,916
What's your education 7

642
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:09,159
Started degree and dropped it to go for work

643
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,126
So you are a 'Pranchiyettan' !

644
00:56:12,155 --> 00:56:12,724
What 7

645
00:56:13,156 --> 00:56:14,760
You are famous but no educatiom!

646
00:56:15,025 --> 00:56:20,737
That's enough

647
00:56:21,097 --> 00:56:22,974
you didn't try it later or what 7

648
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:30,041
I will have to attend class for 10-15
days so I will have move from Vadakancherry

649
00:56:30,173 --> 00:56:32,153
oh... if you are not there
Vadakancherry will stumble it seems

650
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:34,588
you have told nothing is impossible

651
00:56:35,112 --> 00:56:37,524
try to do it

652
00:56:38,548 --> 00:56:38,958
shouldl 7

653
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:40,993
yes... you should...

654
00:56:41,618 --> 00:56:42,028
0k

655
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:50,027

656
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:58,704

659
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,584

00:57:14,985 --> 00:57:16,225
so who will look after the studio then 7

661
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,165

663
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:23,031
This dad is always ..

664
00:57:24,628 --> 00:57:29,077
All this generation are same

665
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,044
Where is our bro guy 7

666
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:33,213
Am here ,here

667
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,084
lfl sit here I can get the best
angle for the scenes to happen

668
00:57:42,078 --> 00:57:43,819
If you are lucky your one more bone will break today

669
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:45,616
You come down

00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:47,122

671
00:57:47,617 --> 00:57:48,994
Just chill man...

672
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:54,494
His dad wasn't able to control
him, that's why he was send with us.

673
00:58:02,298 --> 00:58:03,003
Welcome

674
00:58:03,566 --> 00:58:04,840
Just tell me what happened 7

675
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:09,039
The new officer is not willing for our opinions.

676
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:10,574
Let me see her first

677
00:58:22,218 --> 00:58:24,198
The one who went inside is Sreedharan

678
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,094
The black shin 7

679
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:26,166
the way he walks itself shows his attitude !!!

680
00:58:26,723 --> 00:58:28,168
Should I slap him when he returns?

681
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:30,296
The one standing outside is his son.

682
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,110
The new officer is taking too much interest
in our matter, hats why we got this so fast

683
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:38,577
will meet the officer and thank her

684
00:58:39,569 --> 00:58:40,070
I will wait here

685
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:42,274
We will complete the formality.

686
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:51,019
Sreedharan... Govt has planned
this policy to help the poor.

687
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:56,557
I wonder how did you got this for last eight times?

688
00:58:58,021 --> 00:59:01,002

Do you have doubt 7

690
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:05,161
I have papers to clear it.

691
00:59:05,328 --> 00:59:08,866
Phone calls will come ,mails will come
even VIP's will come here to prove it

692
00:59:09,032 --> 00:59:12,673
Ramendhran's fann house will get
a help if they get this supply.

693
00:59:12,769 --> 00:59:17,980
We should be proud to have one export
licensed fann house in our society.

694
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:23,808
This is my authority so don't try
to play the bloody politics here.

695
00:59:34,724 --> 00:59:36,101

Sir... please stop...

699
00:59:52,942 --> 00:59:58,016
Once an accident occurred on
our bridge and at that time

700
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:04,015
I was stuck in the river that time
the guy named Vasu rescued my life,

701
01:00:10,894 --> 01:00:16,674
I have been searching for his family till date now

702
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:22,043
I finally found them so I have to support them

703
01:00:22,973 --> 01:00:32,326
Even if I get dismissal I will do this, 25
jamnapyaris will go to the hands of Vasoottan

704
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:35,686

thought first I will finish the work and come.

707
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:11,193
You have made a big enemy now.

708
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:14,365
I know but it's not bigger than life.

709
01:01:15,124 --> 01:01:18,697
Vasoottans dad gave back my life,so at least this"

710
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,240

712
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:26,708

713
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:31,042

Veena... you came like an angel.

720
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:16,761
The devil is preparing his cavalry now.

721
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,363
He looks young right?

722
01:02:18,888 --> 01:02:25,134
He was famous defender for Kerala football team ,he used
kick the opponents that time now the business competitors

723
01:02:25,528 --> 01:02:28,236
We should be careful, he

01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:38,041
Vasu told nothing to worry.

746
01:03:39,135 --> 01:03:40,409
Then it will be big problem.

747
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:49,549

01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,155

What happened?

752
01:03:59,055 --> 01:04:04,164
There was about 8 people, came in a
mini lorry and thrashed everything.

753
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:07,407
When I went to block them, they pushed me down.

754
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:15,948
And they took 10 of our goats and went !

755
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:17,281
Do you know who are they 7

756
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:20,284
should they tell !! we know it.

757
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:33,496
Sabu call Thoma and say not to bring those 25
goats here, we will see another place to keep them

758
01:04:33,556 --> 01:04:35,900
Parvathy... you take father to the hospital

01:05:12,128 --> 01:05:13,505
Who are you 7 I didn't understand !!!

765
01:05:14,664 --> 01:05:18,134
My name is Vasoottan ,came to take the goats

766
01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:22,274
I need 10 of them

767
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:24,150
It will be too expensive son

768
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,281
I don't think you can afford to it

769
01:05:29,078 --> 01:05:33,117
I can afford to it that's why I came directly to ask

770
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:38,088
Otherwise I would have send people to bring it.

771
01:05:38,688 --> 01:05:41,168
You have enough strength to send people 7

772
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:45,701
Yes I do have strength but I won't
because my routine is to do myself

773
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:50,239
try to do so , you won't leave this field then.

774
01:05:52,168 --> 01:05:55,012
Are you saying that you will hurt me with your people ?

775
01:05:55,271 --> 01:06:05,124
Then you should tell to kill me otherwise
somehow I will reach Vadakancherry...

776
01:06:05,648 --> 01:06:10,256
...and I will bring my people to finish you, Mind it

777
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:17,169
Get out son, don't show too much
attitude thinking your dad was so great

778
01:06:18,227 --> 01:06:19,535
You are elder otherwise, hey...

779
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:22,174
Will you beat me'?

780
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:25,475
Try to win the game

781
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:30,150

782
01:06:32,308 --> 01:06:35,152

01:07:35,538 --> 01:07:38,576
Can I ask you something ?if you don't mind !!!

787
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:40,286
YES ask !!

788
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:44,687
Your dad was not sure about the
kid while he went to rescue right 7

789
01:07:45,348 --> 01:07:52,357
so you should learn from that right 7

790
01:07:52,722 --> 01:08:01,403
it's like I never felt dad was wrong not
even my mom think so why should I change?

791
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:07,280
We should not change what we wish..

792
01:08:13,843 --> 01:08:14,651
When will you come back 7

793
01:08:15,144 --> 01:08:17,886
now itself ,I just have to take bath and have a tea

794
01:08:18,247 --> 01:08:20,227

01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:21,287

01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,166
Of course ,if we take another car he will feel bad.

798
01:08:26,255 --> 01:08:27,256
Too much distance right 7

799
01:08:27,356 --> 01:08:32,356
No its near only, George sir's friend is
there, he will do the setup to comeback as soon.

800
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:40,511
Then ok, go safe and come back.

801
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:41,807

802
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:47,621
Oh... you don't like that, don't take
care, do all rubbishes, get in every trouble.

803
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:48,752
That's the spirit

804
01:08:49,946 --> 01:08:54,258

805
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,922

808
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:03,535

821
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:47,413

Vasoottan, all village is searching for you.
You have beaten up the infamous thugs of this area.

990
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:30,600
So we didn't waste our energy

991
01:27:31,266 --> 01:27:32,336
Tomorrow is state hanhal

992
01:27:32,768 --> 01:27:41,688
it's because of the Murder happened on last day,
before that you should reach back to your place with goat.

993
01:27:45,914 --> 01:27:47,791
We will go at midnight !!!

994
01:27:48,016 --> 01:27:51,793
But if we are late at night Raghavan will
be practicing 'theyyam' around the streets

995
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:54,298
Is this the Raghavan who is
about to sell us the goats!!

996
01:27:54,389 --> 01:27:55,026
Yes!!

997
01:27:58,026 --> 01:28:00,905
I will come at night with a vehicle ok

998
01:28:01,329 --> 01:28:02,831

You think they will touch you?
We will finish them before that.

1003
01:28:24,352 --> 01:28:26,457
We should have accompanied Parvathy too

1004
01:28:26,955 --> 01:28:30,528
No that would have been a big risk

1005
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:37,435
The thrill we experience should be passed
to the ones we love, that the real thrill

1006
01:29:09,497 --> 01:29:10,532
Wait here, I will go

1007

Don't take it serious this is a
pan of our countries celebration

1012
01:30:16,898 --> 01:30:20,607
What a timing for harthal.
Just a minute I will move it.

1013
01:30:21,469 --> 01:30:23,915
After moving these ,you only go,
I won't take my lorry a step ahead

1014
01:30:24,505 --> 01:30:26,041
How will that happen 7

nearby, just 45 minutes more.

1019
01:30:38,753 --> 01:30:39,561
If so

1020
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:41,696
People will change at the starting of harthal or what 7

1021
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:46,905
it's because of fear ,its not my own
vehicle, if something happen ,I can't afford

1022
01:30:50,065 --> 01:30:52,170
still it's so dark !!! where is the sun 7

Some people will take new vehicle and
put name as Chunkz, dude, popiens...

...and after a crash they will change to Amme

1046
01:32:42,811 --> 01:32:43,846

You start your vehicle now

1053
01:32:54,188 --> 01:32:55,132
Take all of our goats

1054
01:32:56,624 --> 01:32:59,662
Get in goat ,get in

1056
01:33:16,311 --> 01:33:17,119
okay

1057
01:33:32,193 --> 01:33:33,934
There is little dust on the car

1058
01:33:35,163 --> 01:33:36,767
It will go when we wash it

1059
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,174
Move!!!

1060
01:33:43,404 --> 01:33:45,008
Too tired, Lets sleep

1061
01:33:46,207 --> 01:33:50,811
The way she goes means today

1062
01:33:50,812 --> 01:33:50,846
The way she goes means today
also No Entry to the bedroom

1063
01:34:55,009 --> 01:34:56,317
What's the matter 7

1064
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,186
Vasoottan where were you 7

1065
01:35:04,152 --> 01:35:07,759
Sreedharan sir, don't bring anymore treats to here.

1066
01:35:08,322 --> 01:35:15,262
I have got 100 jamnapyari, 90 reached
and rest 10 is on the way from Alapuzha.

1067
01:35:15,763 --> 01:35:16,741
Who needs your goats !!!

1068
01:35:17,031 --> 01:35:19,910
He have not understood the whole matters now.
Vasoottan come here...

1069
01:35:25,073 --> 01:35:26,984
He came to help us

1070
01:35:28,776 --> 01:35:29,311
to help 7

1071
01:35:29,844 --> 01:35:36,318
Sreedharan came with a proposal for my
daughter, to marry his son Goutham with Parvathy

1072
01:35:38,086 --> 01:35:44,162
Goutham was interested in her ,Now Sreedharan
has brought this proposal, so we agreed.

1073
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:47,169
Now he will deal with farmhouse and its orders.

1074
01:35:47,362 --> 01:35:55,782
You don't worry you will get enough commission for
the goats you brought, we will give you more instead

1075
01:35:56,437 --> 01:35:58,383
You just take those goats to Sreedharans farm

1076
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:03,985
Goats can be taken to Theni's farm house because the
climate over there is best suitable for those goats

1077
01:36:04,379 --> 01:36:06,086
Sir please be seated inside..

1078
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:16,193
Vasoottan you leave now ,tomorrow morning all their
relatives will come to see our daughter so I have to prepare

1079
01:36:20,561 --> 01:36:22,336
Vasoottan

1080
01:36:26,067 --> 01:36:31,244
I know you have been struggling for us and money.

1081
01:36:32,173 --> 01:36:33,151
Very thankful to you

1082
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:38,854
But when I get an offer like this I
should look the future of my family.

1083
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:41,023
That's why it's all happening.

1084
01:36:42,183 --> 01:36:43,491
You shouldn't be hurt with this

1085
01:36:45,353 --> 01:36:50,268
No ,You said at least ,that's enough

1086
01:36:50,591 --> 01:36:53,800
Dad Sreedharan sir is calling you !!

1087
01:36:54,162 --> 01:36:56,540
I am coming, Let me go Vasoottan

1088
01:37:34,335 --> 01:37:39,341
After marriage everybody wants to go with their
wife but you always want to go with Vasoottan

1089
01:37:39,607 --> 01:37:41,245
Vasoottan... Nasoottan... , Vassukuttan...

1090
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:42,612
every time his name

1091
01:37:43,044 --> 01:37:44,455
Don't shout anymore !!!

1092
01:37:45,013 --> 01:37:47,050
What will you do if I 7

1093
01:37:47,982 --> 01:37:53,432
He was the only one who groomed me to
be a perfect man in order to marry you

1094
01:38:20,014 --> 01:38:23,052
You see ,this soap will spread its
fragrance everywhere in Vadakanchery,

1095
01:38:23,317 --> 01:38:28,460
The society gets stable by making these
kind of products in their own area.

1096
01:38:29,123 --> 01:38:30,067
Will all this happen 7

1097
01:38:30,358 --> 01:38:33,032
Till the time we say ourselves that
we failed, we might have not failed

1098
01:38:33,394 --> 01:38:36,603
...and nobody can beat us also.
This will work out

1099
01:38:37,098 --> 01:38:43,208
If we like something extremely then
those things will also start liking us.

1100
01:38:52,113 --> 01:38:53,251
Are you mad 7

1101
01:38:53,548 --> 01:38:54,925
today there is a function to see the bride !!

1102
01:38:55,216 --> 01:38:57,253
Let me make it more beautiful then

1103
01:38:57,685 --> 01:39:00,529
What is in your mind now 7
You think she is in love with you?

1104
01:39:01,122 --> 01:39:02,692
Not sure still...

1105
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:10,531
You only told yesterday that she
didn't talk or give importance to you.

1106
01:39:11,099 --> 01:39:15,707
I was thinking about it,
She isn't aware of my love towards her

1107
01:39:18,205 --> 01:39:19,149
Then you call her and ask

1108
01:39:19,507 --> 01:39:21,578
She won't pick the call because last day...

1109
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:26,021
...I didn't pick her call even after 17 missed
calls , I thought I will see her direct

1110
01:39:30,484 --> 01:39:32,122
Son ,what you are about to say to her 7

1111
01:39:32,487 --> 01:39:34,728
Don't try to fix her marriage because we are in love

1112
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:37,196
Does she love you?

1113
01:39:38,225 --> 01:39:39,135
Most probably

1114
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,236
she will

1115
01:39:43,464 --> 01:39:45,466
what if she doesn't 7

1116
01:39:49,236 --> 01:39:50,738
Whats sure about there is a kid in the bus?

1117
01:39:51,339 --> 01:39:52,215
What if not there!!!

1118
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:55,177
What if there?

1119
01:40:02,183 --> 01:40:04,163
What if she do 7

1120
01:40:20,467 --> 01:40:22,003
I think they came

1121
01:40:22,236 --> 01:40:23,180
They reached so early 7

1122
01:40:30,444 --> 01:40:31,582
ah.. Vasoottan !!!

1123
01:40:33,314 --> 01:40:34,122
What happened 7

1124
01:40:35,816 --> 01:40:36,624
Why you came 7

1125
01:40:38,286 --> 01:40:41,062
I came to ask you for pardon

1126
01:40:41,822 --> 01:40:42,698
Come inside

1127
01:40:48,529 --> 01:40:49,371
What happened?

1128
01:40:54,201 --> 01:40:57,705
My dad has done too much goodness for others

1129
01:40:58,505 --> 01:41:01,611
But he never did it for any return

1130
01:41:04,245 --> 01:41:12,096
But I got a mistake, whenever I brought
each goat I had awish and I did it for that.

1131
01:41:13,087 --> 01:41:14,259
Isn't it wrong 7

1132
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:17,201
Pardon me for that

1133
01:41:20,828 --> 01:41:23,434
From the time I met Parvathy I loved her

1134
01:41:24,832 --> 01:41:28,211
...and I thought that will be given back.

1135
01:41:29,837 --> 01:41:33,114
I think that she too likes me

1136
01:41:33,674 --> 01:41:36,245
If so please don't move on with the proposal now

1137
01:41:36,744 --> 01:41:38,655
I will manage Sreedharan and jamnapyari

1138
01:41:39,113 --> 01:41:42,219
Aah.. ,you are taking all decisions yourself 7

1139
01:41:48,256 --> 01:41:50,566
Vasoottan, I know what all you are saying..

1140
01:41:50,892 --> 01:41:56,501
...and even I too supported when
you people mingled each other...

1141
01:41:57,231 --> 01:42:02,237
...but that was according to situation in order to
make you fulfil the order, That shouldn't have allowed 7

1142
01:42:02,903 --> 01:42:07,352
she doesn't feel the same ..

1143
01:42:09,577 --> 01:42:12,558
Who will love someone in the first sight itself 7

1144
01:42:25,793 --> 01:42:33,177
Vasoottan but each time when I was
with you my love increased for you,..

1145
01:42:33,601 --> 01:42:37,549
"Even we did all this disgrace and you
are asking for pardon

1146
01:42:38,505 --> 01:42:42,180
Do you think someone will stop
loving this kind of a guy 7

1147
01:42:43,845 --> 01:42:44,823
That means 7

1148
01:42:44,945 --> 01:42:47,482
The most loved one in the
mother earth is my Vasoottan

1149
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:50,861
I like live with you

1150
01:42:56,257 --> 01:42:58,635
You should have told this earlier

1151
01:42:59,193 --> 01:43:02,197
How will I know that you loved me 7

1152
01:43:02,796 --> 01:43:04,332
Should I do the rituals to find it 7

1153
01:43:04,799 --> 01:43:08,804
You don't pick calls, and last
day you gave a pose and went back

1154
01:43:08,969 --> 01:43:09,674
Daughtefl!

1155
01:43:09,937 --> 01:43:10,915
Dad please let me say

1156
01:43:10,971 --> 01:43:15,545
The person who always interrupts in every matter
kept silence over this ,so what should I think?

1157
01:43:16,277 --> 01:43:19,224
I thought, I will say it directly

1158
01:43:19,513 --> 01:43:22,653
I didn't sleep for last two days
,thinking that your call will ring now.

1159
01:43:24,585 --> 01:43:26,826
But I was sure you will come.

1160
01:43:26,921 --> 01:43:29,731
Anyways I came right 7 now am not going leave you !!!

1161
01:43:29,957 --> 01:43:32,494
I am only sad thinking about making
tea for you each and every time

1162
01:43:43,804 --> 01:43:45,841
Are you dreaming 7

1163
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:48,246
What's up 7

1164
01:43:48,576 --> 01:43:49,953
Veena Got transferred

1165
01:43:51,278 --> 01:43:53,417
Punishment transfer it seems.

1166
01:43:54,248 --> 01:43:54,658
To where 7

1167
01:43:55,249 --> 01:43:56,250
some new place near to Trivandram.

1168
01:43:56,817 --> 01:43:57,818
She should join today itself!!!

1169
01:43:57,918 --> 01:43:59,261
What kind of play is that now?

1170
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:07,437
She is getting screwed from the upper authorities,
Sreedharan started to take his strength

1171
01:44:07,995 --> 01:44:09,269
We will have witness more

1172
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:10,335
Vasoottan!!!

1173
01:44:11,432 --> 01:44:13,309
Ah We are going to Veena's place

1174
01:44:13,667 --> 01:44:14,543
Hope you heard the news!!!

1175
01:44:14,968 --> 01:44:23,888
Not only transfer for her but the orders she made is also
withdrawn it seems, there is a notice to give back 15 goats

1176
01:44:24,011 --> 01:44:25,991
Hey son, everything thing going out of our view

Vasoottan , you came and told everything,"

1178
01:44:29,817 --> 01:44:34,891
...after that Sreedharan came so I told him the
matter, he went back without even saying a word.

1179
01:44:35,323 --> 01:44:38,031
After sometime I got call from co operative bank.

1180
01:44:38,726 --> 01:44:40,330
They talked a lot

1181
01:44:41,361 --> 01:44:42,431
The from agency

1182
01:44:42,963 --> 01:44:43,941

and at last this notice to give back goats

1184
01:44:49,737 --> 01:44:55,050

01:45:00,014 --> 01:45:02,290
...there will people gathering around my house...

1187
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:06,588
...that will be the people who came
to see me hanging on the rope to death

1188
01:45:14,695 --> 01:45:15,833
Don't give up Vasoottan !!

1189
01:45:16,063 --> 01:45:17,542
I don't have such habit.

1190
01:45:17,865 --> 01:45:20,971

nothing will happen without struggle

1206
01:46:19,793 --> 01:46:27,075
It's not because of that ,Sreedharan is unpredictable
,you people should be here for security reasons

1207
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,538
So are you going alone 7

1208
01:46:30,037 --> 01:46:32,108
You people move now, let me talk with Thoma

02:00:48,728 --> 02:00:50,969
From where will you bring a
