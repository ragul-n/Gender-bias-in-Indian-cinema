1
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,583
Yes, I am on my way.

2
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,167
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

3
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,625
Sorry. I am coming.

4
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,208
<i>Take your time.</i>

5
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:41,208
<i>I just thought of reminding you
that half a million listeners are waiting.</i>

6
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:44,500
I hate you, Krishna.

7
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,458
<i>From the aroma of the coffee
To the golden rays of sunlight</i>

8
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:05,750
<i>Every morning feels like a new one</i>

9
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,792
<i>After slowly waking up
From the world of sweet dreams</i>

10
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>Every morning feels beautiful</i>

11
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:19,417
<i>Like a tune on the radio</i>

12
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,000
<i>Like a song sung by the birds</i>

13
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:28,708
<i>Infinite songs fill my heart</i>

14
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:33,667
<i>Infinite musical notes
Are calling out to me</i>

15
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:34,750
<i>Wake up</i>

16
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,667
<i>Wake up and get up</i>

17
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,917
<i>It's a beautiful morning</i>

18
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,542
<i>Fly high in the sky</i>

19
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:51,542
<i>Dance and rejoice this morning</i>

20
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:56,083
<i>I love you, morning</i>

21
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:06,167
<i>I love you, morning</i>

22
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,583
<i>I love you, love you</i>

23
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,792
<i>I love you, morning</i>

24
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,208
Why are you so late today?

25
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,417
Actually, I had a problem today.

26
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,292
-The shower was not functioning...
-Not you. I know you're always late.

27
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,958
I was talking to him.

28
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,250
Were you jogging or were you talking
with someone?

29
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,708
I am tired. I can't get along with her.

30
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,833
She's always shouting.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,542
Am I still a child?

32
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,583
Come closer. Come a little bit closer.

33
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,750
Open your mouth.

34
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,250
Okay. He has definitely smoked
about three to four cigarettes.

35
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,500
You can keep shouting at him.

36
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,625
Hey!

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,792
You always take her side.

38
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:49,958
That's a lie.

39
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,833
Antra never lies.

40
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:56,333
<i>Wake up</i>

41
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:01,083
<i>Run and run</i>

42
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,042
<i>The delicious combination
of flavor and aroma</i>

43
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,125
<i>that can only come from Paras Chili.</i>

44
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,583
<i>It will make you...</i>

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,750
Who will listen to the radio
when there are so many advertisements?

46
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,000
<i>Traffic is always in a jam</i>

47
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,000
<i>Hey, hero! Make way</i>

48
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,708
<i>I am not interested in waiting</i>

49
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,292
Hey, miss. Listen.

50
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,875
You can't park here.
You've blocked the entrance.

51
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,292
Listen, miss.

52
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,583
Tell whoever is going to park next
to move it, okay?

53
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,250
She never listens to anyone.

54
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,417
I'm sure you don't read the newspapers.

55
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,250
Antra, listen.

56
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,292
This political scenario is very important.

57
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,625
We must cover it in the second link.

58
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:03,250
RJ is busy with something else.
He won't listen to me.

59
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,042
-Hey, K.
-Yes.

60
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,125
Tell me something.

61
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,792
Should I get a dog?

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,708
I think that you should get a boyfriend.

63
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,083
Yes, sure.

64
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,875
Will he be available
given his tight schedule?

65
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,417
Come on, hurry up. It's late.
Link 1 is about to start.

66
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,500
An apple in the studio?

67
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,125
You know that apples aren't allowed
in the studio.

68
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,458
An Apple phone is allowed,
but not the fruit?

69
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,792
-This is unfair.
-Antra.

70
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,958
<i>Sweet fights are yet to make</i>

71
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:35,083
<i>Let this morning halt for a moment</i>

72
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:40,000
<i>Wake up and get up</i>

73
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:44,167
<i>It's the beautiful morning</i>

74
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,167
<i>I love you, love you</i>

75
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,375
<i>I love you, morning</i>

76
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,792
What was the saying?

77
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:54,042
If you really desire something
from your heart,

78
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,958
then the universe will help you get
what you want.

79
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,833
That's a big conspiracy.

80
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,792
I mean, I don't know what is wrong
with the universe,

81
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,625
but today, trouble keeps coming my way.

82
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>I know, I am late.</i>

83
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,917
What can a poor girl do?

84
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,250
<i>First of all,</i>

85
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,417
I was solving a murder mystery
at midnight.

86
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,083
I had gotten the last clue.

87
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,875
Just like Daya, I was about to break open
the door, and then...

88
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,458
And then my alarm rang.

89
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,542
<i>First, the mystery in my dream
remained unsolved.</i>

90
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,125
And then my shower gave up on me.

91
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,542
That's not all.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,708
While balancing an apple,
my bag, my shoes, and coffee in one hand,

93
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,417
<i>I finally got to the office.</i>

94
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,417
I came in late, but I came in one piece.

95
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,375
It's a fun rise with the sunrise,
only on Love Line.

96
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,583
Live from your heart.

97
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,417
Okay, you have any interesting, funny,
or weird news?

98
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,000
Take this.

99
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:02,583
Anything else?

100
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,500
Shall I write down the link for you?

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,875
Don't taunt me.

102
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,583
Where's the monkey?

103
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,292
I don't know.

104
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,417
Maybe he's on his way.

105
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,833
None of you come on time.

106
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,417
Don't act smart.

107
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,167
<i>After 20 years of being married,</i>

108
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
a husband drove away his wife

109
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,417
<i>for not cooking his favorite dishes.</i>

110
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,625
God might be late,
but he always does his work.

111
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,417
Ma'am, do you have to party?

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
<i>Seriously.</i>

113
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,000
If you're listening to me,

114
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,625
<i>then trust me.</i>

115
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,500
You're all set, boss.

116
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,417
And for the man,

117
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,125
just marry a chef.

118
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,792
<i>And then you will be happy.</i>

119
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,833
<i>On 94.3 MY FM.</i>

120
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,500
-Hey, stop. Stop.
-<i>Greetings, Ahemdabad.</i>

121
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,167
-<i>You're with RJ.</i>
-Hold this.

122
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,500
<i>Live from your heart.</i>

123
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,375
Does this look like sweat?

124
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,958
Does this look like sweat?

125
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,083
Idiot.

126
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,917
Antra, don't forget RJ's message
in the next link.

127
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:10,667
It's very important.

128
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:12,958
See.

129
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,167
The producer of the show enters
after the show has started.

130
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,333
No, actually.

131
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,542
My scooter got a flat tire.
So I had to push it for a while.

132
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,708
Then I got it repaired.

133
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,417
Where could you get it repaired
at 7:30 in the morning?

134
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,208
-It's near my house.
-Where?

135
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,625
Nehru Nagar.

136
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,250
I just came from there.
None of the car repair shops are open.

137
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,708
Jaydev, give him some water.

138
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,542
I gave him some, but he didn't drink.

139
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,500
Why?

140
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,417
He just poured it on himself.

141
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,375
Not "sorry."

142
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,292
Say this,

143
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,125
"I am a monkey."

144
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,292
Hey, I am not a monkey.

145
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,833
I'm Manan Kapadiya.

146
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,375
Here's your coffee.

147
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,458
I have a severe headache.

148
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,875
I think I have to drink more tea.

149
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,292
Boss, that's exactly my point.

150
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,375
What?

151
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,958
Tea is like marriage.

152
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,083
It's like that couple in the newspaper.

153
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,250
People drink tea because they have to,

154
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,583
not because they want to.

155
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,333
And your bitter coffee?

156
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,417
-It's like the hot girlfriend.
-Or boyfriend?

157
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,917
Yes, or a boyfriend,
with whom people share a special time.

158
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,083
They spend hours
enjoying each other's company.

159
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,042
Tea is routine. Coffee is special.

160
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,625
The person with whom you share
the coffee or tea with

161
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,917
makes it special.

162
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:42,792
How many references
will you use to teach me about love?

163
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,083
Until you believe in love.

164
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,542
In your dreams.

165
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:48,167
-But K.
-Yes.

166
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,542
I think Salman will marry before me.

167
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:51,667
What do you think?

168
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:04,625
This years' Young Achiever Award of Media
goes to...

169
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,292
RJ Antra.

170
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,500
Cheers to all those

171
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,333
who broke up in your show.

172
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,000
Who does a show to win awards?

173
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,167
Right!

174
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,417
Who does a show to win awards?

175
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,708
I do it, only to help lost lovers
get back to living their life.

176
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,375
<i>So this is Antra,</i>

177
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,000
<i>the most popular RJ in Ahmedabad.</i>

178
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,375
<i>She's surrounded by people,
but is really all alone.</i>

179
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,042
<i>She is always smiling,</i>

180
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,667
<i>but she's quiet,</i>

181
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,125
<i>as if she's in constant search
of something.</i>

182
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,250
<i>Whether she's sipping coffee alone
on her balcony,</i>

183
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,958
<i>or when she's jumping
from a height of 100 feet.</i>

184
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,833
<i>She's fond of adventure sports.</i>

185
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,833
<i>But the biggest adventure</i>
<i>of her life is on its way,</i>

186
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,792
<i>and she's unaware of it.</i>

187
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,917
So, let's begin
with your favorite segment.

188
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,792
Your questions and Antra's answers.

189
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,917
"Love ni Bhawai."

190
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,458
Antra, my girlfriend wants to take
a selfie with me every day.

191
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,542
How do I refuse her?

192
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,292
Tell this to her next time,

193
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,958
"Let's take a selfie.
Your friends say that I look cute."

194
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,042
He's always busy
with Facebook and WhatsApp.

195
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,292
<i>What do I do?</i>

196
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,500
It's very simple.

197
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,125
Open your account on Facebook,

198
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,167
and write "I love you" on his wall.

199
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,708
He will then deactivate his account.

200
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,458
Swati.

201
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,083
Tell me, Swati. What do you want to say?

202
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,583
Actually, I don't know why I called you.

203
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,750
You can talk to me casually.

204
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,333
Now that you've called, let's talk.

205
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,750
Are you single or committed?

206
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
Actually, I have a boyfriend.

207
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,083
But, nothing.

208
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,500
Swati, people in love say
that they love each other.

209
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,833
They never say, "He loves me."

210
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,333
Swati?

211
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,083
No, it's not that.

212
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, let me ask you.

213
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,708
What's your boyfriend's name?

214
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,417
Sagar.

215
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,875
She's Sagar's girlfriend.

216
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,792
Where is he?

217
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,083
Where's Sagar?

218
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,417
What are you all talking about?

219
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,583
We've been waiting for Sagar
since this morning.

220
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,458
Call him up. Message him on WhatsApp.

221
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,208
Take a cab and bring him out of his house.

222
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,292
Yes, correct. This is perfect!

223
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,000
Welcome. Welcome, sir.

224
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,250
Welcome.

225
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,708
And go on!

226
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,667
Keep taking selfies.

227
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,583
Take as many as you want.

228
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,292
With as many people as you want.

229
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,583
And while all the computers
in the office are down,

230
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,750
you will take selfies.

231
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,500
-I wasn't taking a selfie.
-Then what were you doing?

232
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,958
I was taking a photo.

233
00:13:56,042 --> 00:14:01,792
And informing my boss
that I've arrived at your office.

234
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,167
-Is it?
-Yes.

235
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:04,917
Come here, you fool.

236
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,958
Do you think I will believe you?

237
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,875
Are you trying to fool me?

238
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,750
Do I need to fool you?

239
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,083
What? What did you say?

240
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,750
-I will throw you out.
-Software.

241
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,375
There was no need to code any software.

242
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You should have called me.

243
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,833
I would be here immediately.

244
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,333
-Now, let's go.
-Come on, make way.

245
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,792
Make way.

246
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,958
I need to do all of this very carefully.

247
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,958
Everything is messed up. Listen.

248
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,042
Yes.

249
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,958
Why are you all looking at me like that?

250
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:40,292
I get performance pressure.
Please, go back to your work.

251
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,708
Pintu.

252
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:43,917
-Yes, Sagar.
-Come here.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,083
-Please sing me a song.
-What?

254
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,458
Look at their faces.

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,708
Sing me a song.
I'm feeling really nervous.

256
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,042
-Come on, sing a song
-Start, idiot.

257
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,000
<i>Sanedo, Red Sanedo</i>

258
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,417
<i>Try and understand if you can</i>

259
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,625
<i>Sanedo</i>

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,292
<i>Red Sanedo</i>

261
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,333
It's done.

262
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,833
Come on, everyone. Get back to work.

263
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,958
The problem is solved.

264
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,250
Wow, son.

265
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,167
May God bless you!

266
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,167
Yes, definitely.
But you better bless me now.

267
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,208
Here's your bill.

268
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,333
Yes, bill. Of course.
I must pay your bill.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,958
-Such a big amount?
-Yes.

270
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,875
Do you want a check or my kidney?

271
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:31,875
Here's the bill.

272
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:32,833
-Hey!
-What?

273
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:35,583
Sir, do you want fast service
for the price of an ordinary one?

274
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,625
You might be a sweet talker,
but you're a genius at work.

275
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,917
You're amazing.

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,083
Come on, give me the money.

277
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,167
Here.

278
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,292
Count it.

279
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,708
-Sir.
-Yes.

280
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,750
I don't need to count the money
in selected transactions.

281
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,083
Wow, that's great.

282
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,333
Yes, Mehul.

283
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,500
Did you listen to Antra? Swati was there.

284
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,083
What Swati? What Antra?

285
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,875
-Who's this Antra?
-Hey, Antra.

286
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,417
-The radio jockey.
-Is she the one?

287
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:07,333
My wife listens
to her radio program every day.

288
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,125
Swati was on a call with her today.

289
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,625
You can tell me if you had a fight
or something.

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,833
There are many women named Swati
in the city.

291
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,625
Why do you think of my Swati only?

292
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,125
Hang up now.

293
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,125
Mehul.

294
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,500
He's totally crazy.

295
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,333
-I heard something.
-What?

296
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,458
"My Swati."

297
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,542
I mean, your Swati.

298
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,583
Who's this Swati?

299
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,250
Sir, she's my girlfriend.

300
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,083
Save the date! It's in June.

301
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,875
You must attend my wedding.

302
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,833
I would go even if you didn't invite me.

303
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:42,792
Go!

304
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,833
Selfie. Just one selfie.

305
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,583
Stop flirting, you've been caught now.

306
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,458
<i>Madam, will you eat</i> momos <i>today?</i>

307
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,042
<i>I don't have any cabbage.</i>

308
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,417
<i>There's nothing else.</i>

309
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:03,000
<i>This is not enough to make</i> momos.

310
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,208
<i>This is Antra's boyfriend.</i>

311
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,958
<i>This is her 2-minute relationship.</i>

312
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,542
<i>Maggi noodles can turn her bad days
into good ones.</i>

313
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,750
<i>If there would ever be a boy in her life,</i>

314
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,958
<i>he would be her number two.</i>

315
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,167
Hey, move!

316
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,542
Stop honking, please. What's your problem?

317
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:34,958
What's the problem?

318
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,417
People have a habit of finding shortcuts.

319
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,042
So, naturally, a traffic jam will occur.

320
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,667
Sir, please relax.

321
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,958
Just a minute. Please. Please, keep quiet.

322
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,292
Don't honk.

323
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,667
One minute. Move little bit this side.

324
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,167
You move back little.

325
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,333
Wait a minute.

326
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,458
You, sir, please go. Please.

327
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,083
Just a minute. There's an ambulance.

328
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,708
There's an ambulance. Please, get back.

329
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:27,417
Antra. All of my friends
have girlfriends except me.

330
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,708
All of them tease me a lot.

331
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,083
<i>-Listen. Do you have PS4?</i>
-Yes.

332
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,708
<i>That's better.
At least you will have the control.</i>

333
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,708
Yes, okay.

334
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,000
"Love ni Bhawai."

335
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,250
<i>We have been married for 25 years.</i>

336
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,375
Now, we are just living together.

337
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,417
But we don't feel like we're together.

338
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:45,625
Sir, have you shared this feeling
of yours with your wife?

339
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,292
-No.
<i>-That's it.</i>

340
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,500
Your love is hidden
in those unshared feelings.

341
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,500
Start sharing everything
that you have in your heart.

342
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,792
<i>I love you, morning</i>

343
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,167
<i>I love you, love you</i>

344
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,500
<i>I love you, morning</i>

345
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,167
To welcome our next young awardee,

346
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,833
I would like to call to the stage,

347
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,875
the young and emerging politician.

348
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,000
Please, welcome Mr. S. K. Pujara.

349
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,458
Usually, we wake up with our alarms.

350
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,792
But Ahemdabad wakes up with Antra.

351
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,625
Today, I'm reminded of my school teacher.

352
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,125
She had told me to start studying
and to stop speaking.

353
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,833
Thank God, I stopped studying,
but not speaking.

354
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,750
I just want to say, please speak up.

355
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,750
Speak up if you don't like something.

356
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,500
And you must speak up
if you like something.

357
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,208
If your thoughts or ideas
are kept in your heart,

358
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,083
you won't be able to get
anything out of them.

359
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,833
That's all I want to say.

360
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,458
Under the section of education,

361
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:40,292
he has transformed 35 municipal schools

362
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,417
into smart schools.

363
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,583
I had started with a small thought.

364
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,792
I've heard a lot of discussions
on the problem of the education system.

365
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,083
And then I realized,

366
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,208
that if we think of the solution,
instead of discussing this problem,

367
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,083
then the world will be
a better place to stay in.

368
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,042
Very good, isn't it?

369
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:17,833
What?

370
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:21,792
I was stuck in a traffic jam
just a few days ago.

371
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,250
The traffic was really heavy.

372
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,583
I was stuck there for 45 minutes.

373
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,958
Because of their frustration,
people were honking and shouting.

374
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,083
And suddenly,

375
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,167
a girl came on the road and she took
the initiative to clear the traffic,

376
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,958
Soon people joined her.

377
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,542
And within five minutes,
she managed to clear the traffic.

378
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:47,333
By the way, that girl was none other
than your favorite RJ Antra.

379
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,042
Everyone who is here

380
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,083
becomes a part of such solutions.

381
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,167
-Exactly.
-K!

382
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,292
Yes.

383
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,667
Shall we go now, K?

384
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,625
Aditya.

385
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:18,875
Krishna.

386
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:20,500
I'm Antra's boss.

387
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,208
Well, I am sorry I don't listen
to the radio that much.

388
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,500
No, don't be. I also don't listen to it.

389
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:30,000
Everyone listens to her.
But she doesn't listen to anyone.

390
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,583
You two can keep talking,
I'll join you soon.

391
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:34,667
Okay.

392
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,417
So how long have you been in that field?

393
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,625
You're always the center of attention.
Don't you feel tired?

394
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,083
They give me 24 hours of their time,

395
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,167
and expect just 5 seconds for a selfie.

396
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,792
It's their right. I must give it to them.

397
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,333
Are you originally from Ahemdabad?

398
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,125
You can address me informally.

399
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,333
And if our conversation is going
to be little longer,

400
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,833
then I need to eat something.

401
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,042
I am hungry.

402
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,000
Relax, I am just joking.

403
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,042
It occupies space on the plate
as well as in the stomach.

404
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,042
I will eat proper food.

405
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,708
Well, I am not a regular radio listener.

406
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:51,083
But I will definitely listen to you.

407
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:58,417
<i>Every time I visualized you
With my eyes closed</i>

408
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:03,292
<i>I've seen you much more than what you are</i>

409
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,333
Give it.

410
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,333
-Sagar.
-Yes?

411
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,625
Are you all going to celebrate
Valentine's Day with just your friends?

412
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,208
Hey, listen.

413
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,500
This Valentine's Day is very special.

414
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,750
Why is that?

415
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,083
I am going to propose to Swati.

416
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,625
To Swati?

417
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,042
Sagar, you had 23 breakups until now.

418
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,625
Do you think you will succeed this time?

419
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,542
Yes.

420
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:32,000
This time I can really feel it.

421
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,208
She's the final one.

422
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,083
She will definitely say yes.

423
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,458
-On this note, let me say something.
-Please go ahead.

424
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,375
"The band will play in his marriage.

425
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,542
The band will play in his marriage."

426
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:46,667
-Great.
-Yes.

427
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,458
Stop.

428
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,542
"After marriage, you will see

429
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,333
blisters on his entire body."

430
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:58,000
-Well said.
-Slap him.

431
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,417
You might spill the tea.

432
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
One more!

433
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,667
-It was very nice.
-Can you repeat that?

434
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,708
She was better.

435
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,958
-I'll tell you once I remember.
-Have tea.

436
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,208
Swati.

437
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:13,833
-I will also contribute.
-I will, too.

438
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,417
Give it.

439
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,292
It's busy.

440
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,375
Hey, Manan. Look at this.

441
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,875
Hey.

442
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,375
They look good together, don't they?

443
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,708
Why do you put him up to it?

444
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,417
You know Antra.

445
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,000
She will fry him in a moment.

446
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:32,458
Really?

447
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:33,958
-Let's try it.
-No.

448
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,125
-Let me fry you.
-No.

449
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,208
-Right, monkey? Come on.
-No.

450
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,667
Come on, monkey. Come on.

451
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,042
-Come on.
-Don't call me a monkey.

452
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,500
I will throw this mic at you.

453
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,125
"She will fry him."

454
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,583
Still, you look good together.

455
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:51,417
Please don't make any rumors about me.

456
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:56,667
<i>Hi. Aditya here.</i>

457
00:25:58,917 --> 00:25:59,875
<i>Can we talk for a minute?</i>

458
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,250
People are talking all over the city.

459
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,417
<i>That's the problem.</i>

460
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,917
You give solutions to everyone,
but you can't give me one?

461
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:08,333
Ignore it.

462
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,292
<i>How can I ignore it?</i>

463
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,958
For the first time, I'm on the gossip page
instead of the business page.

464
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,833
And these people used my old photo.

465
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,542
You know what?

466
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,750
People are congratulating me.

467
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,958
People will always say something.
It's their job.

468
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,458
But what do you want to say?

469
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,583
I wanted to ask you if we can meet.

470
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,000
But it will be a little awkward, right?

471
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,000
Not at all.

472
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,667
<i>So shall we meet?</i>

473
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,333
Another photo will be published tomorrow.

474
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:50,250
May I come in, sir?

475
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:57,375
Sir, actually the traffic in the DCP...

476
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,875
Stop your excuses.

477
00:26:58,958 --> 00:26:59,875
Okay, sir.

478
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,833
My newspaper is not interested
in your DCP.

479
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,000
Not, what?

480
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,000
It's the four C's that are important.

481
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,292
People enjoy them the most.

482
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:08,958
I hope you remember.

483
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:13,542
Sir, I told you about this C last time.

484
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,792
And you had lost your temper.

485
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,625
Do you want me to say it again?

486
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,875
-Stop. Not that C.
-No!

487
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:23,958
The four C's are important in journalism.

488
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,208
-Put it in your head.
-Yes, I already have.

489
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,667
-What are they?
-You tell me.

490
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,458
Comedy.

491
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:34,542
And...

492
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,375
celebrity.

493
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,375
Bring some news about this RJ.

494
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,250
Then we'll have an interesting story,

495
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,875
a story that no one else
except Padkar will have.

496
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:51,958
It's yours.

497
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,625
What?

498
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,333
A challenge.

499
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I see.

500
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:01,958
-I make the rules and decisions.
-Decisions.

501
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,125
Sir, please take this.

502
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,333
Put that down. Put it down.

503
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,333
Give me this one.

504
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:37,917
This one.

505
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,000
This one.

506
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,875
And this one.

507
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,167
I have to change my Facebook status

508
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,500
from single to committed.

509
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:50,792
I am not getting married,
but I'm going to propose.

510
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,000
Then buy the red roses.

511
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,250
They're very common.

512
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,750
I want to do something different,
something special.

513
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:58,750
-Really?
-Yes.

514
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,458
Then do this. Buy jasmine.

515
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,625
Stop telling me
and just give me a bouquet.

516
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,542
You're Swati, right?

517
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,958
I wanted to ask you something.

518
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:22,250
Tell me. I knew you wanted
to say something that day.

519
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:26,000
Actually, my boyfriend is going
to propose me today.

520
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,083
God, listen.

521
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,458
I prayed for your blessing
for me to pass the tenth grade,

522
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,125
but you didn't help me.

523
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,542
I prayed for your blessing
for me to be admitted to Xavier,

524
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,083
but you didn't even help me a little.

525
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:53,958
This time, please bless me
with a happy life with Swati.

526
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,417
What I feel for Swati is something
that I've never felt for anyone else.

527
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,042
It's from inside...

528
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,542
Yes!

529
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:03,958
He's here!

530
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:08,208
He felt the same
for those 23 ex-girlfriends.

531
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,042
-Exactly.
-Hey.

532
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,875
I don't have time for all of you.

533
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,833
Hey, we are also coming.

534
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,083
I am not going to a party.

535
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,792
So please, don't interfere.

536
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,875
I am going to propose her.

537
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,750
Sagar, please allow us.

538
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,708
We will watch from afar.

539
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:33,708
How could we miss the historic moment
when a girl would say yes?

540
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:34,792
But you won't come.

541
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,500
No way.

542
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,583
None of you will come. Get out. Come on.

543
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,708
-Hey, Sagar, please. Please.
-Sagar, please!

544
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:00,875
Oh, no!

545
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,417
Is she bailing on us?
It's been nearly half an hour.

546
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,250
She will come. Keep quiet.

547
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,375
She's like the police in Hindi movies.

548
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,375
She will definitely be late.

549
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,250
Quiet. She's here.

550
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,667
Yes, she's here.

551
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:20,792
That's great!

552
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:24,750
-<i>Near the seashore</i>
-Both of them are matching.

553
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,292
-They're both wearing black.
-Yes.

554
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,667
I object.

555
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,292
-He has never offered us a seat.
-Please keep quiet.

556
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,458
Just watch.

557
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,375
Hey, she stood up.

558
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,792
She threw down the flowers.

559
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,333
The 24th girlfriend has also left.
What now?

560
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,000
Let me say something.

561
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,167
-I won't encourage you.
-Never mind.

562
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,708
He started as a romantic hero.

563
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,083
But now he became a comedian.

564
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,833
He lost his love on Valentine's Day.

565
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,125
It's too bad.

566
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:09,750
Yes, Mom.

567
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,542
It's 10:00 p.m.

568
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,292
When are you coming home?

569
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,708
It's 9:30 p.m.

570
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:18,000
I might come home late.
Please, go ahead and eat dinner.

571
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:22,208
No, it's Valentine's Day.
I will wait for you.

572
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,417
How long will you wait, Mom?

573
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,375
Until you get your life partner.

574
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,833
<i>Listen.</i>

575
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:36,000
Make some porridge for me.
I have an upset stomach.

576
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,875
Why don't you care about your stomach?

577
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,208
Stop eating too much
of those fried snacks every day.

578
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,542
And then everything will be normal.

579
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:46,250
The starting tomorrow, I won't. I promise.
Now, please make porridge for me.

580
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,625
-And listen.
-What?

581
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,917
Drink some medicine for your digestion
before going to bed.

582
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,000
I can tolerate your snoring,
but not the other things.

583
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:54,958
What's this?

584
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,667
Why didn't Sagar come and pick me up?

585
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,625
I waited in school for an hour,
so I went home on my own.

586
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,792
He is not even answering my calls.

587
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:03,958
Sagar didn't pick you up?

588
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,208
Do you know where he went?

589
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,833
Why didn't you pick me up?

590
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,750
Is there a problem between you and Swati?

591
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:25,708
Don't look at me like that.

592
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:30,083
Every time you've quietly locked
yourself in your room,

593
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,125
it's always because of a girl.

594
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,667
What happened?

595
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:36,792
Forget it, Dad.

596
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,083
I don't want to talk about this.

597
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,583
All right. I will talk to Swati.

598
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:43,625
We broke up.

599
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,250
Swati broke up with me.

600
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:50,875
Now, please don't ask me anything.

601
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,292
All right.

602
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,375
I won't ask.

603
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:58,875
But can I say something?

604
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:04,833
Kavita and I were from the same college.

605
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,583
This was before I met your mom.

606
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,708
We were in love with each other.

607
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,500
We had decided to get married.

608
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,542
But her dad was against it.

609
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,958
He said he would drink poison
if she goes for inter-caste marriage.

610
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,125
She never met me after that.

611
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,917
At that point, I thought
that I would never be able

612
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,625
to love anyone in life.

613
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,292
And then I met your mom.

614
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,958
And I never realized that we fell in love.

615
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,042
With every heartbreak,

616
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:53,417
someone will enter your life
to love you again.

617
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:54,958
Remember that.

618
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,250
And yes,

619
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,875
I want to stay on your mom's good side,
so don't tell her about all of this.

620
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:02,708
She doesn't know.

621
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,583
But she might ask you someday.

622
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,292
She already asked me.
She still asks me today.

623
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,500
Do you like <i>Kavita</i>?

624
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,333
And I tell her that I still like it.

625
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,375
What?

626
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:15,958
I like poetry composed by Gulzar.

627
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think we should organize
a prayer for peace.

628
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,125
Why?

629
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:32,500
For all those whose love life ended,
with your counseling yesterday.

630
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,583
Krishna.

631
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,542
When one falls in love,
they never consult with me.

632
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,250
They consult with me
when they want to break up.

633
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,333
But we can reason with them.

634
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,458
People usually consult with people

635
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,833
who say exactly what they want to hear.

636
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,583
We don't consult to be reasoned with.

637
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:51,792
I see.

638
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,250
Sagar, look at my Pokémon shirt.

639
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,833
It's Pikachu.

640
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,083
Be careful.

641
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,417
Someone might pull on your shirt

642
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,250
in an attempt to catch pokémon.

643
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:03,292
-What are you saying? Go away.
-Yes, if they want Pikachu.

644
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,125
Tell me.

645
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,292
<i>-Sagar.</i>
-Yes.

646
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,208
<i>-Did you get that?</i>
-It's Mehul.

647
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,458
What?

648
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,833
<i>The audio. It is viral on WhatsApp.</i>

649
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,417
<i>The reason of your breakup.</i>

650
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,917
<i>It became viral, Sagar.</i>

651
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,375
Please be specific. What are you saying?

652
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:22,000
<i>Swati's audio recording with RJ Antra.</i>

653
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,625
<i>Are you there?</i>

654
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,583
Send it to me. Send it to me now.

655
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,333
What happened?

656
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,458
-What happened?
-Sagar, what happened?

657
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,458
<i>Look, Swati, you're in control
of your own life.</i>

658
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,958
<i>All decisions related to it
should be yours to make.</i>

659
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,292
But I am ready to wait.

660
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,708
It's useless, Sagar.

661
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:06,167
<i>Close your eyes and ask yourself
what you want.</i>

662
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,208
This is viral on Facebook as well.

663
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,917
<i>I don't want anyone to get hurt.</i>

664
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,250
<i>Swati, if you're not sure,</i>
<i>then you will get hurt</i>

665
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,917
<i>and you will hurt others as well.</i>

666
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:22,333
We will only hurt each other
if we are together.

667
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,250
<i>Antra, what would you do</i>
<i>if you were in my place?</i>

668
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,792
<i>I would refuse.</i>

669
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,292
<i>I would break up with him.</i>

670
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,667
<i>It's not so easy.</i>

671
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,208
<i>It will be difficult later on, Swati.</i>

672
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:46,708
<i>It's your choice, but my advice
is to break up with him.</i>

673
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:49,833
<i>Swati.</i>

674
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,500
Do you know what you're doing? Do you?

675
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,375
Yes.

676
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:09,667
I have to meet this Antra now.

677
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,417
<i>I am coming to pick you up.</i>

678
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:18,792
Are you always so stubborn?

679
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,792
Come on. I'm not being stubborn.

680
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,875
I can even pick you up.

681
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,333
You!

682
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,375
I see.

683
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,958
You will feel ashamed, won't you?

684
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,167
It's the male ego, right?

685
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,375
It's nothing like that.

686
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,250
Are you nervous?

687
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,333
Fasten your seatbelt.

688
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,917
I hope you brought your license.

689
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,208
Yes, I do. Do you need it?

690
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,083
No, the traffic enforcers
might need to see it.

691
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,208
What?

692
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,583
Because I don't have my license
with me today.

693
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,375
No, it's okay. I drive every day.

694
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,667
I don't know why the brakes
aren't working properly today.

695
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,625
I got it checked yesterday,
I don't know why.

696
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,917
Yes. I got it checked yesterday.

697
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:20,333
This is very risky.

698
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,625
Slow down.

699
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,083
Use the clutch.

700
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,583
And pull over to the left.

701
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,458
You can leave. He will take my order.

702
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,583
What's the special?

703
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,083
Yes.

704
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,875
And I know his order.

705
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,042
I think you also sleep in a suit, right?

706
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,125
Actually, I never sleep.

707
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,833
Once the US clients wake up,

708
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,542
I start getting calls and e-mails.

709
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,500
Wow, do you play the piano?

710
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:39,917
No, I've just bought one.

711
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:41,917
I will learn it when I have the time.

712
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,417
I'll learn it in five years and play
in a concert in ten years.

713
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,375
Should you plan
for doing something you like?

714
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,875
Trust me, it works.

715
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,083
With planning, life is easy.

716
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:56,750
With planning, you can do projects.

717
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,083
You can't live your life.

718
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,458
So how should we live life?

719
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,000
Like the radio.

720
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:08,875
The next song that will play on the radio
is always a surprise, right?

721
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,292
Similarly, the next minute of your life
should be a surprise for you.

722
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,875
There's no fun in living with planning.

723
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,708
But, I mean...

724
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,750
A girl and a boy can never be friends.

725
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,833
This Bollywood trope is fixed in our minds

726
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:36,750
and is the main reason
for all the confusion.

727
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,958
Boys are often confused

728
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,750
<i>between love and friendship.</i>

729
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:44,125
<i>If a girl wants to befriend a boy,
she's in love.</i>

730
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,583
<i>But now they are even confused</i>

731
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,042
between love and a cup of coffee.

732
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,875
Please explain to them

733
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,292
<i>that going out for coffee isn't the same
as saying yes to marriage.</i>

734
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,333
Aditya.

735
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,708
Since when did you start listening
to the radio?

736
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,208
It just happened. The cook gave it to me.

737
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,042
It plays in the background, you see.

738
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:17,833
You didn't even ask
for the newspaper today.

739
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,500
Because I read it in my room.

740
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,167
Actually, I'm getting late.

741
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,333
Tell Dad to come home straight, all right?

742
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,000
-Remember one thing.
-What?

743
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:36,667
Going out for coffee isn't the same
as saying yes to marriage.

744
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:37,792
That...

745
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:46,375
Here. Cold drinks for this party.

746
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:49,083
Mehul, what about you?

747
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,375
Give me a small glass.

748
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,667
Did I call you over
just to enjoy the cold drinks?

749
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:58,375
Hey, you. Put that down.

750
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,417
-Let's do something extreme!
-Then go and jump.

751
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,583
Look.

752
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:03,708
You know about Romeo and Juliet.

753
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,500
-Yes,
-And Bajirao and Mastani, right?

754
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,667
The heroine will be impressed
when she sees the hero's action.

755
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,250
-Right?
-Absolutely.

756
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,333
Hey,

757
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,375
RJ Antra is not my heroine.

758
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:18,625
RJ Antra is my enemy, so please.

759
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,583
Just listen.

760
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,208
This guy will whistle at Antra.

761
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,292
Okay.

762
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:27,042
Then you will come and beat him up, okay?

763
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,917
Then she will fall in love with you.

764
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:30,375
Idiot.

765
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:32,792
Look at this.

766
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:35,708
Look.

767
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,833
A celebrity will always fall in love
with another celebrity.

768
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,125
Look at him.

769
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,792
Our Katappa.

770
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,542
Does he match with her?

771
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:51,875
Look at his T-shirt and jeans.
Do they match?

772
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,167
So how will he match with her?

773
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:58,042
Wow, it's a very nice photo.

774
00:43:58,958 --> 00:43:59,958
Hey.

775
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:03,333
Sagar and Antra.

776
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,833
We will take a photo of them together
and publish it.

777
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:08,167
Really?

778
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,083
You idiot.

779
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,250
Hey, this is my house.

780
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:13,958
Okay, go ahead.

781
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:16,542
My boss is already mad for this RJ Antra.

782
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,125
He wants news about her in his newspaper.

783
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:24,000
What if we take your photograph
with Antra and publish it?

784
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,083
We'll call it an affair.

785
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,125
But what am I supposed to tell her?

786
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,875
That I'm her fan
and I want to take a selfie with her?

787
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,750
What nonsense.
Think of something else, you idiot.

788
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,833
No, I didn't mean that.

789
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,125
Listen. We'll take a photo of you and her.

790
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,542
And you'll look like a celebrity couple.

791
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:41,417
It's fake news.

792
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,792
We will publish the news.

793
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:47,458
"RJ Antra's Second Affair."

794
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,125
She will be ruined.

795
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,625
Great.

796
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:07,583
Yes, tell me. What were you saying?

797
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:09,583
I didn't know that you go
on coffee dates, Antra.

798
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:11,417
Just a minute. It was not a date, okay.

799
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,667
Actually, I had come to talk
about another date.

800
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,375
I'm going to have a small party
on the day after tomorrow.

801
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:22,875
A party without reason, right?

802
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,667
It's my mom and dad's 35th anniversary.

803
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,917
Oh, but I am so sorry.

804
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:32,167
We'll keep each other company.

805
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,250
-You are invited, too.
-Yes, sure.

806
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:37,500
But actually...

807
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,083
Did he just order me?

808
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:47,833
Bhura.

809
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,750
You didn't serve us tea.

810
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,000
He's acting like nothing is wrong.

811
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,458
He couldn't take a single photo.

812
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:57,875
Not a single one.

813
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,375
Take your breakfast later.

814
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:02,333
Be a good photographer first.

815
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,500
Are you a crime reporter?

816
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:06,333
I don't think so.

817
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:10,042
You can't even take wedding photos.

818
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:12,292
-Throw away this breakfast.
-Keep quiet.

819
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,083
Enough!

820
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:17,167
Keep quiet.

821
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,792
Sagar, your photos will be taken.

822
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:23,958
Your photos will be taken.
I will take them.

823
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:26,500
Photos of you and Antra will be taken.

824
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:27,542
I promise.

825
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,583
It's a promise.

826
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,625
But I won't compromise my breakfast.

827
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,167
Oh, no. He wasted the bread.

828
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,125
-Get me another plate.
-He has wasted it.

829
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:45,083
"Do waves ever ask the sand?

830
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:47,792
'Would you like to get wet?'

831
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:50,250
So you can't fall in love
by asking permission."

832
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:51,750
That's great!

833
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:53,917
"So, you can't fall in love
by asking for permission."

834
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,167
Amazing!

835
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:09,500
Yes?

836
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,333
-Yes.
-Dad.

837
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:20,417
That's it.

838
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,500
-How are you?
-Bless you.

839
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:23,833
Bye, son.

840
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:27,917
Isn't she RJ Antra?

841
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,375
How did Aditya meet her?

842
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:31,708
When I was younger,

843
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,667
I used to attend events like these
with a Walkman

844
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:38,250
to avoid the fake gossip of fake people.

845
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:44,875
When I was younger,

846
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:47,917
my mom would force me
to go to these parties.

847
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,417
"Adi, sing that song.

848
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,833
Adi, do that dance."

849
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:56,167
I don't know if people had noticed
your performance at that time or not.

850
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,167
But right now, almost everyone
is watching you.

851
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:05,292
It's nothing like that.

852
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,750
I'm going, now.

853
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:07,875
Let's have dinner.

854
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:10,000
I have a morning show.
It's already very late.

855
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,542
But I don't want to give you
the wrong idea.

856
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,250
So I hope you understand.

857
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,125
-What?
-We are...

858
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,167
You're not giving me
the wrong idea, all right?

859
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:36,625
Because I know,

860
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,792
that going out for coffee isn't the same
as saying yes to marriage.

861
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:56,750
Who is this from?

862
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,750
You can't buy cassettes anymore.

863
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,708
So what do I do with this Walkman?

864
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,542
Did you ever think of why
it is called Walkman?

865
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:31,500
But how do I convert this walk-woman
into a talk-woman?

866
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:32,792
How do I get the cassettes?

867
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,042
<i>You will have to manage that.</i>

868
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,375
Shall we meet tomorrow?

869
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,292
Sorry. I am going on a trip.

870
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:43,500
But we will definitely meet
after I return.

871
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:44,833
Where are you going?

872
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:46,833
Ask Google.

873
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:48,958
Hey.

874
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,833
I have breaking news.

875
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:05,958
Let's go to the washroom.

876
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:07,458
No.

877
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,833
Stop moving too much.

878
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:12,583
I have breaking news.

879
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:15,500
So what are you waiting for?
Come on, tell me quickly.

880
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:17,958
-RJ Antra...
-Yes.

881
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:20,958
She's going on a trip.

882
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,417
It's confirmed!

883
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,167
So what are we going to do?

884
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,292
We will follow her.

885
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,625
No one will interfere.

886
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,417
You, her, and my camera.

887
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,958
Where is she going? Tell me.

888
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:42,833
I don't know where.

889
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:49,000
You idiot. You might as well take photos
of the dead.

890
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,833
You can't remember anything. Get lost.

891
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,833
-Hey.
-What happened?

892
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:56,375
-What...
-Stand straight.

893
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,500
Give me just one chance.

894
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,708
One chance. And then you watch.

895
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,375
I will get all the details.

896
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:06,167
Give me just one chance.

897
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:08,292
You just follow me.

898
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:18,667
Do you see that man?

899
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,625
Who? Who are you talking about?

900
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:23,542
The one standing beside Antra.

901
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,917
Yes.

902
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,542
He's her colleague.

903
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,500
Okay.

904
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,708
He will definitely know
about Antra's trip.

905
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,167
There he is.

906
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:55,792
What?

907
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:58,583
I'll stay late in the office.
Please eat your dinner.

908
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,417
Yes, I will come home late.

909
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,500
I am coming.

910
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,333
Two?

911
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,875
Seems like he's having an affair.

912
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,708
He has two. And look at you.

913
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,458
Follow him.

914
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:47,292
Girls pull him in.

915
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,083
But what about you?

916
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:53,000
Why do you always tease me?

917
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,833
Let's go now.

918
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:57,708
Who's this?

919
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:02,542
It's the courier.

920
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:05,042
You ordered something online, madam.

921
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:06,208
What's she doing?

922
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:07,917
My shoes have come.

923
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,125
-Give it to me.
-Yes, it's here.

924
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,250
Just a second. What are you doing?

925
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:14,542
Darling.

926
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:15,583
Hey.

927
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:17,292
Who are you?

928
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,875
What are you doing?

929
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:21,250
We are couriers from the angel of death.

930
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,833
You have one final call.

931
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:24,292
-Very good.
-Oh, no.

932
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:26,958
-One from this angle.
-Another from this direction.

933
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:28,625
Yes.

934
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,333
Should we send these pictures
to his wife on WhatsApp

935
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:34,542
or upload them on Facebook?

936
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,792
Hey, I don't know you.

937
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:40,792
Why are you doing this?

938
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,208
-You don't know?
-No.

939
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,417
You don't know me?

940
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:45,542
Okay, let me add you on Facebook.

941
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:47,417
Shall I send you a friend request?

942
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:49,875
What are you doing, man?

943
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,917
Just do as we say.

944
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,375
What do you mean?

945
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:56,875
One question.

946
00:55:56,958 --> 00:56:00,125
Just answer one question
and we will leave.

947
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:02,542
-Darling, who are they?
-Just wait, baby.

948
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,917
Wait a minute.

949
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:08,167
Stop moving this swing. I am scared.

950
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:10,875
Go ahead. Ask.

951
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:12,917
Your RJ.

952
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,125
What's her name?

953
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,375
-Mantra.
-No.

954
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:16,292
Santra.

955
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,208
Antra.

956
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,458
Where is RJ Antra going?

957
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,333
I don't know.

958
00:56:22,417 --> 00:56:23,583
Don't know? He doesn't know.

959
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,500
Wait. What should be the caption
on his photo?

960
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:30,417
Let me think...
Someone is caught red-handed.

961
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,333
Too good.

962
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:34,833
Also add this, "feeling unfaithful."

963
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,208
And the hashtag, palpitation, you know?

964
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,083
Then put a smiley face with shades.

965
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,917
And then the grinning smiley face.

966
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:46,958
I would have definitely told you
if I knew.

967
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,208
Please, delete my photos.

968
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,750
Now your wife will delete you.

969
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,583
You had danced like a serpent
in your marriage, right?

970
00:56:55,708 --> 00:57:00,625
Now your wife will show you
how a serpent will react.

971
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,042
Just a minute.

972
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:04,667
Darling, what are they talking about?

973
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:05,625
Wife?

974
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,458
No, darling. I will explain everything.

975
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:11,083
Tell her later. Tell us first.

976
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:14,125
Otherwise, we will start posting.

977
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:15,792
Look, this will be on Facebook,
on Twitter.

978
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:19,750
Then on Snapchat, LinkedIn, Instagram,
and you're gone.

979
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:25,125
After two days, the 8:00 a.m. bus to Diu.

980
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:27,083
Diu.

981
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:30,875
Wow, what a location!

982
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,625
Wow! It's my favorite place.
Give me a high-five.

983
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,208
Hey, Mehul. You will be with me.

984
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:39,083
Get up, you idiot.
Are you coming with me on vacation?

985
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,292
What I mean is, you're going to follow me.

986
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,750
Follow us and take photos, okay?

987
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:48,875
I'll only take photos when she allows you
to stand near her.

988
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,292
Don't challenge me.

989
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:51,708
Just don't challenge me.

990
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:53,458
-Sagar.
-Mom is coming.

991
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:55,792
-Hey, close it.
-Yes, mom.

992
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:00,917
Packing? Where are you going?

993
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:02,583
Mehul, didn't you tell her?

994
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:03,917
Should you not tell her?

995
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,792
Mom, actually, we are going to Diu
for a few days.

996
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,833
-We're also coming?
-Keep quiet.

997
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,333
I hope you're not going with Swati.

998
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:16,750
Stay away from her.

999
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:19,083
No, Mom. We all are going.

1000
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:21,708
Just for a change. To clear our minds.

1001
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,750
I wouldn't have refused
if you had told me.

1002
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,292
You never say anything to me these days.

1003
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:26,792
You just keep quiet.

1004
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:30,292
Okay. Sorry, Mom.
I will cancel the trip if you want.

1005
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,500
-Shall I cancel?
-See, he's refusing.

1006
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,708
But all of you planned this,
so you should go.

1007
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:36,667
Yes.

1008
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,042
But come and have lunch now.

1009
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:40,375
And what time will you leave
in the morning?

1010
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,458
I will prepare some flatbread.

1011
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,125
Mom, what's this? Why do you make
flatbread every now and then?

1012
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:47,125
Bring them back
if you don't want to eat them.

1013
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,125
But you must take it.

1014
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:52,667
Remove a few T-shirts
to make space for the flatbread.

1015
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:55,083
-Come on!
-Put in extra flatbread, Mom.

1016
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:59,792
-Hey, fatty, get out of the car! Hurry up!
-Get out of the car!

1017
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:01,250
Hey, Mehul!

1018
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,333
I have the luggage!

1019
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,917
Hey, go for it.

1020
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,458
Take good photos!

1021
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,708
-Make sure to secure the luggage, okay?
-Okay.

1022
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,417
Hail, Lord Krishna.

1023
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:24,542
Where?

1024
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,333
There is.

1025
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:34,833
<i>Exchange with that woman.</i>

1026
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:37,292
<i>How? Shall I go and sit on her lap?</i>

1027
00:59:37,417 --> 00:59:39,375
<i>Idiot, sit quietly. Don't irritate me.</i>

1028
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,208
<i>How do I tell her to get up?</i>

1029
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:45,000
<i>Do something or else you'll play around
until we get to Diu.</i>

1030
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,958
We working women have to manage
so many things.

1031
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,542
Home, family, office.

1032
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:54,708
No one understands.

1033
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,000
Frankly speaking,
we do have cooks and servants at home.

1034
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,750
Still, we have to manage everything.

1035
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:06,000
We can't leave the house to the men.

1036
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,000
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes?

1037
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:14,375
Yes?

1038
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,042
May I say something?

1039
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:17,833
Because I cannot stop myself
from saying this.

1040
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:18,750
Yes, what is it?

1041
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:21,625
You're exactly like my friend's mom.

1042
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:23,458
-Really?
-Yes.

1043
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,583
-We call her a superwoman.
-I see.

1044
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:29,042
Multi-talented. She can manage everything.

1045
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,167
Oh, that's so sweet of you, son.

1046
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:36,667
Good. At least someone recognizes my work.

1047
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:38,875
Yes.

1048
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:42,583
Do you have a plastic bag?

1049
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:45,208
Plastic bag? No.

1050
01:00:45,292 --> 01:00:46,500
But what's the problem? Tell me.

1051
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:51,167
Ma'am, I have motion sickness.

1052
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:55,417
-I see.
-If I'm not by the window, I feel like...

1053
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:57,500
Sometimes it happens.

1054
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,500
It's all right, son. Don't worry.

1055
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,083
I'm sitting by the window.

1056
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:06,292
Let's do this.
Let's exchange our seats. Okay?

1057
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,333
-Really, ma'am?
-Yes, son.

1058
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,833
It's not a big deal.

1059
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:13,250
You're too much.

1060
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:14,833
What a relief!

1061
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:16,500
Okay.

1062
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:28,250
Usually, I book a window seat.
But this time, I did not.

1063
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,583
Usually, I book both the seats,

1064
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,625
so that no one sits next to me.

1065
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,208
It's just that I didn't book this time.

1066
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:42,500
Yes.

1067
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,542
Hello.

1068
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,208
Yes, mom.

1069
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:48,583
Yes, I am in the bus.
Yes, sitting by the window.

1070
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:50,917
I don't want to eat your flatbread.

1071
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,250
Will anyone start eating
as soon as the journey starts?

1072
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:54,458
Why do you ask constantly?

1073
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:56,500
We just started on the road.

1074
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,542
Yes, I will eat them later.

1075
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:00,542
Is flatbread something so precious?

1076
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,292
Keep quiet. Don't call me again.
I will inform you as soon as I arrive.

1077
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:06,167
Yes, bye. Okay, mom.

1078
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,708
<i>Don't talk to only your mom.</i>

1079
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:25,208
Hey.

1080
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,750
I didn't tell you my name, did I?

1081
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,333
Because I didn't ask.

1082
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,125
You might have thought
that if you ask me my name,

1083
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:38,750
it might give me a wrong signal, right?

1084
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:40,208
So let me introduce myself.

1085
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:49,458
I have a boyfriend and he says
that I am a terrorist.

1086
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,417
If you had a boyfriend,
he would have sent you

1087
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,250
a lot of messages and called you by now.

1088
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,750
And in reply, you would have sent him...

1089
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:02,000
many selfies with a pouting face.

1090
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,083
Don't worry. Since you've started
the topic, let me tell you.

1091
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,792
If she speaks to little,
then how will it be when we reach Diu?

1092
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,375
It will be difficult.

1093
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,958
Go away. Just sit there and take photos.
Okay?

1094
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:35,500
Because there was no other vacant table.

1095
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:38,083
Don't give me that look. Chill. Okay?

1096
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:44,167
Don't you have to call your mom?

1097
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:49,958
Flatbread?

1098
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:52,917
-It's very tasty.
-Who will eat my fried chapati?

1099
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,375
Take this homemade flatbread
and keep your fried chapati.

1100
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,500
This is the signature dish
of the Gujarati family.

1101
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,583
It's sure to be in everyone's bag
while traveling.

1102
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:05,583
It's not in my bag.

1103
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:08,750
Doesn't your mom pack flatbread for you?

1104
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,333
Don't ask about my mom.

1105
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:18,083
She would rather unpack my clothes
to make space for the flatbread.

1106
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:22,125
But I have a rule. Mom is like a villain.

1107
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:23,417
You must keep her happy.

1108
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:34,833
<i>Hi, this is Love Line</i>
<i>and you're listening to Ruchi.</i>

1109
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,042
<i>I know, Antra is not there.</i>

1110
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:04,458
<i>I wish you to be mine</i>

1111
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:08,208
<i>My heart has many hopes</i>

1112
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:10,833
<i>Will this dream ever come true?</i>

1113
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:16,208
<i>From the falling stars</i>

1114
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:21,000
<i>I ask you in my life
Will this dream ever come true?</i>

1115
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:26,500
<i>It's magic, let me be under its effect</i>

1116
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:31,125
<i>Let me express</i>

1117
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:36,417
<i>My love for you today</i>

1118
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:40,792
<i>You happen to come across</i>

1119
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,583
<i>You happen to smile</i>

1120
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:50,667
<i>You happen to call me often</i>

1121
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:55,333
<i>I happen to see you</i>

1122
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:58,958
<i>And hear you everywhere</i>

1123
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:05,208
<i>And understand you all the time</i>

1124
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:35,792
Yes, Mom. What is it?

1125
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:38,833
Yes.

1126
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,625
I already ate the flatbread.

1127
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,458
You kept asking me
if I ate flatbread or not!

1128
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,208
Okay. I want you to do something.

1129
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,208
It's very important, so do it carefully.

1130
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,833
Call me later tonight. Okay?

1131
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,750
I'm still on the way.
I'll call you when I get there.

1132
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,833
Okay? Bye. Hang up now.

1133
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:07,083
Wow, Deepu.

1134
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:12,292
While God was busy making people,

1135
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:16,333
he must have thought
of creating a unique one.

1136
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:18,167
And that one must be Deepu.

1137
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,167
She's flawless.

1138
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:22,750
Drink some water.

1139
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:25,083
Do you need some medicine?

1140
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,500
"I think she's okay, honestly."

1141
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,833
Are you so in love with Deepika?

1142
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,375
You must be a fan.

1143
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:33,750
I am not just her fan.
I am in love with her.

1144
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:37,458
What do you mean?

1145
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,375
Do you mean to say
that you have never experienced

1146
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,042
one-sided love before?

1147
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,417
What nonsense? Shah Rukh Khan?

1148
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,542
Ranbeer Singh? Fawad Khan is the new hero.

1149
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:53,083
There must be someone from Bollywood.

1150
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:56,083
I mean, not exactly love.

1151
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,917
But Jagjeet Singh. I like him.

1152
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,625
I get a sort of feeling from his voice.

1153
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:03,000
It's like a special connection.

1154
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,833
And the rest...

1155
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:07,500
Like the ghazals?

1156
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,500
What about your other experiences?

1157
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:11,667
Did you have many breakups in life?

1158
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:14,750
I did not, but I've made many breakups.

1159
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,250
Listen, darling.

1160
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,458
You didn't tell me your name,
so naturally...

1161
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:27,375
Antra.

1162
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,875
Sagar.

1163
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:35,375
Imagine if our wedding invitation
is printed. It will be stylish.

1164
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,375
It will have flowers. Just imagine it.

1165
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,292
Ours?

1166
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:48,958
The imagination can go anywhere.

1167
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,042
Where do you work?

1168
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,917
I'm a radio host.

1169
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:05,375
So you're RJ Antra?

1170
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,000
I am sitting next to RJ Antra.
I thought so.

1171
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:10,792
What did you think?

1172
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,417
You're a celebrity.

1173
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:15,458
That's why you're not smiling so much.

1174
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:23,417
Can we share?

1175
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:25,917
-What?
-Can we share the earphones?

1176
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:35,792
Don't speak incorrect English.
You can talk in Gujarati. It's okay.

1177
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:37,542
There's still two hours
before we reach Diu.

1178
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:49,333
It's such a sad playlist.

1179
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:53,625
-Give it back.
-I mean it's good. It's not bad.

1180
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,083
This is also a feeling, right?

1181
01:10:07,417 --> 01:10:08,875
Call Mika Singh.

1182
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,042
Wait.

1183
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,542
I mean, even Arijit Singh is good.

1184
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,375
They both have the surname Singh.

1185
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:38,208
Hey, you got it?

1186
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:39,625
-Yes.
-What?

1187
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:41,167
She's in the next hotel.

1188
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,167
I see.

1189
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:48,125
Sir. A double bedroom
for both of you, okay?

1190
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:49,375
Yes.

1191
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:54,000
Sir, shall I upgrade you both
to our honeymoon suite?

1192
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,250
Mister.

1193
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,583
What do you mean?

1194
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,833
We both are straight.

1195
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,083
-I am also straight.
-Yes, you are. I know.

1196
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:12,750
But sir, we don't have a room
with twin beds available.

1197
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:15,417
Only rooms with a double bed
are available.

1198
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:18,042
Is that okay?

1199
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,333
<i>Mehul.</i>

1200
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,708
Mehul.

1201
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:39,917
What's it?

1202
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:43,292
You go if you want to.

1203
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:45,750
You have to woo her. Not me.

1204
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:49,250
Then who will take the photos?
Mr. Pradyuman?

1205
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,292
-Who's he?
-Your dad.

1206
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:55,375
-Hey, don't use my dad's name.
-Exactly. I am leaving.

1207
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:56,958
I have the key to this room.

1208
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:59,208
Once you get up, come out
and take the photos. Quickly. Bye.

1209
01:11:59,917 --> 01:12:01,333
Yes.

1210
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:37,083
Are you following me?

1211
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:42,208
No, I was following my workout.

1212
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:46,458
At 11:30 a.m.?

1213
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,708
You didn't have breakfast, right?

1214
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:51,000
Why?

1215
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,125
Just say yes or no.

1216
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,333
No.

1217
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:54,583
That's why.

1218
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,958
You'll feel irritated
when you have an empty stomach.

1219
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,833
I mean, I am going to have breakfast.

1220
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,500
Would you like to have some snacks?

1221
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:25,333
Actually, I always take the deal
with complimentary breakfast.

1222
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:27,292
-But today, you know what?
-Yes.

1223
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,417
And here's your breakfast.

1224
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:32,208
Don't you have flatbread?

1225
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:33,750
Yes, I have it.

1226
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:35,583
It is in my room.

1227
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:37,667
You're a smart girl.

1228
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:43,167
Is the flatbread an excuse
to come to my room?

1229
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:47,875
What's your hobby?

1230
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:51,042
Is that question from the manual
for arranged marriages?

1231
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,500
And sometimes I write.

1232
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:01,333
Where? On Facebook?

1233
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:04,792
For myself.

1234
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,125
I mean, not for myself.

1235
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:12,667
But sometimes you feel that you want
to say something, but not to anyone.

1236
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,167
Only girls feel like that.

1237
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,250
Boys always speak whatever comes to mind.

1238
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:17,708
Just a minute.

1239
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:19,708
Why do you always differentiate
between girls and boys?

1240
01:14:19,792 --> 01:14:21,625
Boys are always very simple.

1241
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,583
If a girl passes by,
he has to stare at her.

1242
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,000
If they see a big stone on the road,

1243
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,583
they will kick it like a football.

1244
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:30,125
And the moment they get injured,
they will use foul language.

1245
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:35,417
The point is, boys will never
understand girls.

1246
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,250
Girls are a total mystery.

1247
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:41,625
They have to have best friends.

1248
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:44,667
So then, the BFFs will be the problem.

1249
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,000
Many times the best friends
become the big problem.

1250
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,042
So what will they do?

1251
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:50,125
They will not share their problem
with their best friend.

1252
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:52,750
They'll share it with a friend,
so the best friend feels bad.

1253
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,542
And the other friend thinks,
"Yes, I am the best friend."

1254
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,375
The actual problem will be pushed aside
and it will create a new problem.

1255
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:00,833
So who's your best friend?

1256
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,875
It's like, you don't know whether to
grow your hair out or keep it short,

1257
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,417
whether to wear heels or flats,

1258
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,042
or which filter to use on Instagram.

1259
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:11,083
When you push these problems aside,
you would have made a new problem.

1260
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:14,833
Applying a different color of nail polish
on one nail and the other.

1261
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:17,000
Once.

1262
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,042
Losing track of Dawood's location
makes sense,

1263
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:24,042
but applying a different color
of nail polish on your third finger

1264
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,333
doesn't make sense.

1265
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:28,917
Do you that boys aren't confusing?

1266
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:30,083
Not at all.

1267
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:32,583
They don't know whether to send
the friend request or not.

1268
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:35,083
If a girl asks you to get coffee with her,

1269
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:37,667
you don't know if she's going to be
your friend or your girlfriend.

1270
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:39,458
"I will look like a kid in a clean shave.

1271
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:41,292
But with a beard, I'll look unruly."

1272
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,250
If I remove my T-shirt,
I'll look like Anil Kapoor.

1273
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,750
If I get a wax, I'll look like
Sonam Kapoor. What do I do?

1274
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:49,208
And you boys are not just confused,
you're a little slow too.

1275
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:51,875
For example,
sitting here and talking to you,

1276
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:55,125
I know that a few boys sitting there
are watching me.

1277
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,292
But you didn't realize it.

1278
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:08,250
You won. Pay the bill.

1279
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,833
-Hey, mister.
-I said, you won.

1280
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:26,667
Catch.

1281
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,958
Look there. The hashtag "couple."

1282
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,958
They came to Diu. You're strange.

1283
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:41,667
Wouldn't they take some photos?

1284
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:45,083
I take photos, but I don't put hashtags
and show it off to others.

1285
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:46,500
I take photos for myself.

1286
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:49,500
In love, people...

1287
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:52,542
But how blind?

1288
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:55,417
Look, that girl will post her photo
on Instagram.

1289
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:57,750
And her "best husband ever" will comment,

1290
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,500
"Love you too, baby."

1291
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:03,167
Idiot, you're on a honeymoon.
Stop using your phone.

1292
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:06,208
Hey, you got a call.

1293
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,625
I am not on a honeymoon.

1294
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:13,792
I need you right now, but you're not here.

1295
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:15,417
Why? What happened?

1296
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:18,000
There's a traffic jam
and no one is here to clear it.

1297
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,542
My mom isn't the only one who calls me.

1298
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:30,833
Shall we go?

1299
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:38,250
Are you going to drop me off at my room?

1300
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:41,542
No, actually...

1301
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:43,208
Yes. What?

1302
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:47,208
Actually, it's too dark.

1303
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:49,167
Yes, so?

1304
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,042
And there are many dogs.

1305
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:53,417
So?

1306
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,583
I am afraid of going alone.

1307
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,833
You mean, I should drop you off?

1308
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:08,167
No, if you don't mind.
I can even tell the guard.

1309
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:10,083
And he will accompany me.
That's it. Nothing wrong.

1310
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:14,500
You're so cowardly.

1311
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,167
If you're scared of dogs,
what will happen to you

1312
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,458
in adventure sports, tomorrow?

1313
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:20,417
I am not afraid.

1314
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:24,333
I'm just afraid of dogs.

1315
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,958
And I'm afraid of cockroaches the most.

1316
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:32,500
Otherwise, I enjoy adventure sports.

1317
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,375
Please, accompany me now.

1318
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,083
Let's go, you coward. Let's go.

1319
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:40,708
Oh, a cockroach!

1320
01:18:48,292 --> 01:18:49,125
-Mehul.
-Yes.

1321
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:50,958
Have you come here to enjoy

1322
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,292
spending your company's money?

1323
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:58,333
Show me the photographs. Show me.

1324
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:00,000
Idiot. Show me.

1325
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:03,417
Give it to me. You just continue eating.

1326
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,583
I see. Whose photographs have you taken?

1327
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,667
You haven't taken a single photo of ours.

1328
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,458
Whose photographs are these?

1329
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,667
You're just saying sorry?

1330
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:24,125
If you won't take my photos tomorrow,

1331
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,375
I will send you back.

1332
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,958
And listen to me,
I have a plan for tomorrow.

1333
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:40,708
Come now.

1334
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:04,417
Oh, gosh! I tripped!

1335
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,167
You don't want me to drop you off today?

1336
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,208
No, no need.

1337
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:49,833
I've befriended the guard
who has befriended the dogs.

1338
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,750
They won't come near me
when the guard is there.

1339
01:20:53,292 --> 01:20:55,417
-And what's your plan for tomorrow?
-What do you mean?

1340
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:58,542
We are on a holiday. We don't need plans.

1341
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:03,125
Photos are already being taken.

1342
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,667
-What?
-I mean, you're already taking the photos.

1343
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,500
Don't you take photos of the sunset?

1344
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:08,667
-Not that.
-Then?

1345
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,500
What's that?

1346
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:12,542
You'll see tomorrow, at 11:00 a.m.

1347
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,458
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

1348
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,792
Hey.

1349
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,792
No, she is going to eat flatbread today.

1350
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,167
I've already packed some.

1351
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:43,500
So if the class extends,
we don't have to worry.

1352
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:44,500
Let's go.

1353
01:21:45,417 --> 01:21:46,583
Let's go.

1354
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:59,625
Will you go to Pakistan like that?

1355
01:21:59,917 --> 01:22:02,917
Okay, take a five-minute break
from time to time.

1356
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:05,833
You get tired very quickly.

1357
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:07,500
What do you mean?

1358
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:10,750
I am an engineer, not a soldier.

1359
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:12,292
And by the way,

1360
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:15,250
in engineering class,
we work harder than this.

1361
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,208
Okay, like?

1362
01:22:16,292 --> 01:22:18,500
Like in a batch of a hundred,
there are only ten girls,

1363
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:21,208
five of which are very studious.

1364
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:25,583
But we work so hard
for the rest of the five.

1365
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:26,625
You won't understand.

1366
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:33,083
So did you impress
any of the girls that way?

1367
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:35,333
You're asking me in a subtle way.

1368
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,792
Are you asking me in a subtle way
if I have a girlfriend or not?

1369
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,583
In fact, I am asking you directly.

1370
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:42,250
Did anyone show interest in you that way?

1371
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:47,333
-Hey, I was in demand, you know.
-Okay.

1372
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,125
It's a different thing
when Punjabis took over the market.

1373
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:53,125
Those people who drink lassi.

1374
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,833
Looking at you, it doesn't seem
like you've ever had a girlfriend.

1375
01:22:59,292 --> 01:23:00,500
It's like you're window shopping.

1376
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,083
Yes, I mean the story never goes ahead.

1377
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:05,625
It just lets you watch.

1378
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:07,500
I see.

1379
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:10,250
You seem to be interested in my story.

1380
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:13,542
Tell me about yourself.

1381
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:16,417
You have a boyfriend or boyfriends?

1382
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,708
You seem like a don, you know.

1383
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,208
I see. Can you tell me why?

1384
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,250
Your boyfriend is with you all the time.

1385
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,458
"Yes, ma'am. Okay, ma'am.

1386
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:29,458
Yes, boss. Okay, boss."

1387
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:35,125
Rather than being a girlfriend,
I would love to be a don.

1388
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,208
You have so much attitude.

1389
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:39,667
It's not that.

1390
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:42,167
But I find all of this fake.

1391
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:45,792
Relations are formed and changed
as you need them.

1392
01:23:47,167 --> 01:23:49,625
There's nothing like love
or unconditional love.

1393
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:54,042
What do you mean to say?
You haven't liked anyone yet?

1394
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:56,167
I've liked a lot of people.

1395
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,750
That notion of love is hard to believe.

1396
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:09,167
Let's go.

1397
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:35,542
<i>The love hidden in my eyes</i>

1398
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:39,583
<i>Reflects in my talks with you</i>

1399
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:41,875
<i>It doesn't listen</i>

1400
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:45,958
<i>Despite having thousands of dreams</i>

1401
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:50,042
<i>I'm stuck dreaming about you</i>

1402
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:52,208
<i>I'm enamored</i>

1403
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:58,917
<i>As if you're a kite and I'm your thread</i>

1404
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:04,292
<i>You're taking me somewhere very far</i>

1405
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:09,583
<i>As if you're a kite and I'm your thread</i>

1406
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:15,250
<i>You're taking me somewhere very far</i>

1407
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:20,417
<i>Even after losing once
I've placed a bet again</i>

1408
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:25,208
<i>Such foolish this gambler heart is</i>

1409
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:30,458
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1410
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:33,125
<i>I've become crazy</i>

1411
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:36,042
<i>For you</i>

1412
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:41,167
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1413
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:46,750
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1414
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,125
<i>For you</i>

1415
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:55,583
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1416
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,125
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1417
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:05,042
<i>For you</i>

1418
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:10,125
<i>As if you're a kite and I'm your thread</i>

1419
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:15,708
<i>You're taking me somewhere very far</i>

1420
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:20,708
<i>As if you're a kite and I'm your thread</i>

1421
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:26,292
<i>You're taking me somewhere very far</i>

1422
01:26:26,417 --> 01:26:31,583
<i>Even after losing once
I've placed a bet again</i>

1423
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:36,583
<i>Such foolish this gambler heart is</i>

1424
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:41,708
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1425
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:44,292
<i>I've become crazy</i>

1426
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:47,250
<i>For you</i>

1427
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:52,333
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1428
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:57,917
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1429
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:00,708
<i>For you</i>

1430
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:07,167
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1431
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:13,083
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1432
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:16,250
<i>For you</i>

1433
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:17,292
What are you writing?

1434
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:19,083
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1435
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:20,875
-Show me.
-Go away.

1436
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:23,292
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1437
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:26,458
You made me walk so much. I am so tired.

1438
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:29,333
Is there a spa in your hotel?

1439
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,125
You want to go to a spa? Come with me.

1440
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:33,417
I will make you experience
the world's best spa.

1441
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:44,292
It was too good to be true.

1442
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:47,458
Have you worked in a spa before?

1443
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:49,250
Talking is a part of my job.

1444
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:54,750
You speak like the people
from the TV shopping channels.

1445
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:58,917
"Hi, my name is Ms. Lolo.

1446
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,458
Earlier, I was very upset.
Boys would run away from me.

1447
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:07,792
Then this product came into my life.

1448
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:12,125
Magic shoes. It has changed my world.

1449
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:15,000
Now, I run behind them with this."

1450
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,458
Will you drink some beer?

1451
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:25,417
A girl is asking you to drink, right?

1452
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:30,083
No, this a confused look.

1453
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:33,667
Even after I became an engineer...

1454
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:37,375
I don't drink.

1455
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,750
You mean never even occasionally?

1456
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,583
Not even occasionally.

1457
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,250
Come.

1458
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,000
It is good.

1459
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:22,500
You played well,
although it was your first time.

1460
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,792
Let's play a game.

1461
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:31,500
You must answer every question truthfully.

1462
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,958
Yes, but what will we do for dares here?

1463
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:42,417
Truth or shot?

1464
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:45,208
What's that?

1465
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:50,750
Where did you get all of these from?

1466
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:55,208
I will speak nothing but the truth.

1467
01:29:56,542 --> 01:29:58,375
Where did she get it from?

1468
01:30:00,167 --> 01:30:01,583
-Come on.
-Yes.

1469
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:06,000
Something about you that no one knows.

1470
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,042
I will tell you.

1471
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:10,917
But you won't tell anyone.

1472
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:16,292
When I was very small,
my mom made me wear a girl's dress.

1473
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:21,792
And she also had some photos taken.

1474
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,667
And there's one more secret.

1475
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:30,542
You must not tell this to anyone.

1476
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,083
When I was small...

1477
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:34,667
I used to...

1478
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:38,875
stammer a lot.

1479
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,625
I stammered too much.

1480
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:48,792
But my parents are very loving ones.

1481
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:55,500
They didn't stop trying
until I learned how to speak properly.

1482
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:59,750
They relaxed only after
I started talking normally.

1483
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:01,792
Okay, tell me.

1484
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,208
When did you kiss someone
for the first time?

1485
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:10,500
Just 15?

1486
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:13,542
I used to enjoy popsicles at that age.

1487
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:19,000
So are you still on the waiting list
or have you got your number?

1488
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,875
What's your intention, ma'am?

1489
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:22,875
Do you want to open an account?

1490
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:25,917
My turn.

1491
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:30,292
Did you ever pee in the swimming pool...

1492
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:45,000
Anyone would do it in a swimming pool.

1493
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:46,250
Especially children.

1494
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,292
I hope you didn't do it
after the banana boat ride.

1495
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,667
Are you done?

1496
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:52,833
Now, tell me.

1497
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:56,583
What is the biggest secret
of RJ Antra's life?

1498
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:18,000
I told my mom to divorce my dad.

1499
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:23,208
Two people live together
only because of social pressure.

1500
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,500
And in our case, it was me.

1501
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:33,542
If I wasn't in their life,
Mom would have already divorced Dad.

1502
01:32:37,792 --> 01:32:39,708
She needed the courage to take that step.

1503
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:42,500
And I gave it.

1504
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,375
With whom do you live now?

1505
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:50,083
With your mom or with your dad?

1506
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:51,917
I...

1507
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,208
I live alone.

1508
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:58,292
Don't you talk to your mom or dad
on the phone?

1509
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:01,417
But that does happen.

1510
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:05,583
You see these loving people
living together.

1511
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,833
All that looks good from the distance.

1512
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:13,833
But if you look closer,
you will start to see the problems.

1513
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,208
But you...

1514
01:33:16,292 --> 01:33:18,375
Your turn is over.

1515
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:19,958
Now, it is my turn.

1516
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:22,875
How many did you like until now?

1517
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:27,708
Twenty-four.

1518
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:31,125
-Twenty-four relationships?
-What relationship?

1519
01:33:31,792 --> 01:33:35,292
Eighteen and a half didn't even know
that I was in a one-sided love with them.

1520
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:39,708
It's like I've graduated from love.

1521
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:46,958
It's very simple, Antra.

1522
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:52,958
When you like someone,
you start liking everything.

1523
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:20,500
Here, drink some water.

1524
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:22,583
Finally, you gave up.

1525
01:34:28,417 --> 01:34:29,292
What?

1526
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:30,417
Yes, just a minute.

1527
01:34:30,542 --> 01:34:32,708
Always speaking incorrect English.

1528
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,042
Your mom never calls you up?

1529
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:37,292
My mom always calls me.
She's like a villain that way.

1530
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:38,958
Your mom never calls,
but my mom always does.

1531
01:34:47,417 --> 01:34:48,458
Come.

1532
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:49,958
I am okay.

1533
01:34:50,792 --> 01:34:53,458
Do you think I am not fine?

1534
01:34:53,708 --> 01:34:57,000
-No, it's nothing
-It's my rule. Drink, but set a limit.

1535
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:59,625
-This much.
-Have you ever drunk before?

1536
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:03,250
-It's the first time, so...
-I see.

1537
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:05,000
-Otherwise, I'm okay.
-Come here.

1538
01:35:15,917 --> 01:35:18,250
This way.

1539
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:30,500
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1540
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:36,000
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1541
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:41,000
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1542
01:35:41,417 --> 01:35:46,625
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1543
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,542
<i>For you</i>

1544
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:57,125
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1545
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:59,833
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1546
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:07,458
I'll never drink again.

1547
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,958
It's 10:00 a.m.
I have to checkout at 11:00 a.m.

1548
01:36:13,042 --> 01:36:14,542
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

1549
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
What's your plan?

1550
01:36:16,667 --> 01:36:17,667
Nothing.

1551
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:21,292
After two days, I'll return to Ahmedabad.

1552
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:23,500
So I guess now we will meet in Ahmedabad.

1553
01:36:25,792 --> 01:36:26,750
Listen.

1554
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:32,917
Will RJ Antra

1555
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:35,542
give me her personal number?

1556
01:36:41,583 --> 01:36:42,750
She'll give it to you.

1557
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:48,000
Shall I drop you off?

1558
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:49,208
No, that's okay.

1559
01:36:49,333 --> 01:36:50,875
I don't like being dropped off
or picked up.

1560
01:37:06,417 --> 01:37:09,125
Oh, look who's here.

1561
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:13,333
My hero. You've done wonders.

1562
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:15,792
You didn't return the entire night.

1563
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:19,042
You must share all the details with me.

1564
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:22,458
Did you do anything special?

1565
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:26,417
We only planned to take the photographs.

1566
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:31,125
But you've done more than that.

1567
01:37:34,167 --> 01:37:35,375
The entire night?

1568
01:37:46,875 --> 01:37:50,458
<i>I kept searching for myself</i>

1569
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:56,500
<i>But always found you</i>

1570
01:37:56,625 --> 01:38:02,750
<i>With a heart full of emotions</i>

1571
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:07,875
<i>You're the companion of a long run</i>

1572
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:12,042
<i>You're the meaning of my poetry</i>

1573
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:19,125
<i>You're the closure of the incomplete story</i>

1574
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:24,708
<i>This is the sweetest punishment</i>

1575
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:28,208
<i>Even the pain is enjoyed</i>

1576
01:38:28,292 --> 01:38:31,500
<i>Come, my beloved</i>

1577
01:38:31,583 --> 01:38:35,750
<i>When you like someone,
you start liking everything.</i>

1578
01:38:36,167 --> 01:38:41,292
<i>Come, my beloved</i>

1579
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:45,583
<i>Come, my beloved</i>

1580
01:38:45,667 --> 01:38:49,792
<i>It has all started
With the meaning of love</i>

1581
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:53,167
<i>Come, my beloved</i>

1582
01:38:53,292 --> 01:39:00,125
<i>-Come, my beloved
-Please come to me</i>

1583
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:04,000
-Listen to me.
-Pack up, we are returning tonight.

1584
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:06,583
-Pack up.
<i>-Please come to me</i>

1585
01:39:06,667 --> 01:39:09,583
<i>What affinity is this</i>

1586
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:14,542
<i>Between the hearts?</i>

1587
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:18,417
<i>Come, my beloved</i>

1588
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:29,083
You should go on such trips

1589
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:31,042
three to four times a year.

1590
01:39:31,583 --> 01:39:33,000
It's for your own good.

1591
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:34,125
Go away.

1592
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:37,333
You look very happy.

1593
01:39:38,292 --> 01:39:39,417
Do you want to say something?

1594
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:47,500
Will I only know from the radio
that you're back?

1595
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:50,000
<i>Well, I am really sorry.</i>

1596
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:52,417
I came back yesterday evening.
I was going to call you, but...

1597
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:54,167
Don't just call me, we have to meet.

1598
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:56,833
<i>-I want to speak to you very urgently.</i>
-Yes. Tell me. At what time?

1599
01:39:57,833 --> 01:39:58,667
At four o'clock.

1600
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,958
It was the traffic. It wasn't my fault.

1601
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,375
You look so fresh.

1602
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,583
That's the magic of world's best spa.

1603
01:40:13,667 --> 01:40:16,750
Aditya, the activities were really fun.

1604
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:18,708
You must really try if you haven't yet.

1605
01:40:18,792 --> 01:40:21,208
Like parasailing,
you'll feel like you're Superman.

1606
01:40:21,292 --> 01:40:26,250
I've decided that I will always go
on a holiday at a beach.

1607
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:30,250
Trust me. It was so amazing.

1608
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,042
I called you here to talk about something.

1609
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:36,167
I kept on talking. Now please, tell me.

1610
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:40,292
Mom is looking for someone to marry me.

1611
01:40:41,417 --> 01:40:42,542
I met one recently.

1612
01:40:42,667 --> 01:40:45,250
Wow. And then? Did you tell her?

1613
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:48,458
-You can sit while I bring the tea.
-It's not funny.

1614
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,083
I just met Sanjana.

1615
01:40:51,917 --> 01:40:53,583
But we hardly met after we grew up.

1616
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:57,667
But if you meet her a couple of times,

1617
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:01,958
you will know if you really feel
like meeting her again or not,

1618
01:41:02,333 --> 01:41:04,458
and if you really wish
to know her more or not.

1619
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:08,375
When you are together,
you forget about your phone.

1620
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:11,458
And when you are not together,
you think about her only.

1621
01:41:11,958 --> 01:41:13,208
If that's going to happen,

1622
01:41:13,542 --> 01:41:16,083
then the arranged marriage can be
a marriage out of love.

1623
01:41:25,917 --> 01:41:27,208
I thought you were against love.

1624
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:29,208
You became like a love guru.

1625
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:05,083
<i>Come, beloved</i>

1626
01:42:05,167 --> 01:42:09,125
<i>Come</i>

1627
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:13,458
<i>It has all started
With the meaning of love</i>

1628
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:16,500
<i>Come, my beloved</i>

1629
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:17,583
<i>Hey, Mr. Coward.</i>

1630
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:20,167
<i>When you can type the message,
why don't you send it?</i>

1631
01:42:20,458 --> 01:42:22,833
<i>Is this a truth or dare?</i>

1632
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:27,625
<i>Come, beloved</i>

1633
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:30,125
<i>Come</i>

1634
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,792
<i>It has all started
With the meaning of love</i>

1635
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:37,250
<i>It has all started
With the meaning of love</i>

1636
01:42:37,333 --> 01:42:40,917
<i>Come, my beloved</i>

1637
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,083
Can you call someone
to meet you in the supermarket?

1638
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:46,083
So what? We can talk
as well as shop for groceries.

1639
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:48,708
Yes, that's really strange.
My mom also said the same thing.

1640
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,583
Enough, it is the end of the shop.
This is enough.

1641
01:42:58,333 --> 01:42:59,708
Don't you have brown bread?

1642
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:02,167
Brown bread? Why so?

1643
01:43:02,292 --> 01:43:03,625
Is there racism in bread, too?

1644
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:05,583
What?

1645
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:07,292
Perfect.

1646
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:09,333
Enough.

1647
01:43:10,875 --> 01:43:14,417
Enough, you will be like me
if you eat too much Maggi noodles.

1648
01:43:15,375 --> 01:43:17,125
She's going to open up a noodle shop.

1649
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Hey, even I love <i>rasgulla</i>.

1650
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:28,875
Then what do you actually love?

1651
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:31,708
Pudding.

1652
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:35,250
Semolina pudding or...

1653
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:38,750
Cooked by my mom.

1654
01:43:43,792 --> 01:43:46,667
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1655
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,667
<i>For you</i>

1656
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,083
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1657
01:43:54,292 --> 01:43:59,250
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1658
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:02,500
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1659
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:18,167
<i>Your silly talks</i>

1660
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:21,583
<i>I get anxious to hear you</i>

1661
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:23,667
<i>I enjoy all your talks</i>

1662
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:28,833
<i>I get anxious to hear you</i>

1663
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:34,208
<i>I enjoy all your talks</i>

1664
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:39,750
<i>Even after losing once
I've placed a bet again</i>

1665
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:44,583
<i>Such foolish this gambler heart is</i>

1666
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:49,542
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1667
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,208
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1668
01:44:55,333 --> 01:45:00,042
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1669
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:05,708
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1670
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:08,292
Hey, sir.

1671
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:10,833
You know what?

1672
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:14,333
After so many calls, even a god
would come down to meet his devotee.

1673
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:17,208
At least answer my calls.

1674
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:18,458
Stop your jokes.

1675
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:20,583
I have great news.

1676
01:45:20,917 --> 01:45:22,458
My boss has decided to publish

1677
01:45:22,542 --> 01:45:25,333
your and RJ Antra's so-called affair
in next week's issue.

1678
01:45:27,667 --> 01:45:28,500
Mehul.

1679
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,583
Not so fast.

1680
01:45:33,417 --> 01:45:34,833
There's no need to hurry up.

1681
01:45:36,458 --> 01:45:38,875
-I will keep the pen drive with me.
-Why do you want to wait?

1682
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:41,167
I've already submitted
the photos to my office.

1683
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:42,625
This is your copy.

1684
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:45,542
Let's just publish it.
Show the entire city.

1685
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:48,167
-This RJ Antra.
-Hey.

1686
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:50,958
It's nothing like RJ Antra.

1687
01:45:53,708 --> 01:45:55,125
You will not publish these photos.

1688
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:57,292
Let me go.

1689
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,083
Why did he change so much?

1690
01:46:10,458 --> 01:46:12,625
-Tell me.
-Make some time tomorrow evening.

1691
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:13,792
Why?

1692
01:46:13,875 --> 01:46:15,583
We have a surprise birthday party
for my sister.

1693
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:16,667
And you're invited.

1694
01:46:17,542 --> 01:46:18,458
<i>-Actually...</i>
-Don't worry.

1695
01:46:18,542 --> 01:46:19,625
Not many people are there.

1696
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:23,625
And frankly speaking, my sister knows
that it is her surprise birthday party.

1697
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:25,083
Okay.

1698
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:32,042
I had ordered a chocolate-strawberry cake.

1699
01:46:32,125 --> 01:46:33,583
That means just one cake.

1700
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,542
Not two cakes with two separate flavors.

1701
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:37,375
What do I do with the two cakes?

1702
01:46:37,458 --> 01:46:39,792
Idiot, why don't you understand?
Hurry up now.

1703
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:42,250
-Hey! Is the playlist ready?
-What?

1704
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:44,000
Honey Singh's full volume.

1705
01:46:44,083 --> 01:46:46,208
<i>I drink four bottles of vodka per day</i>

1706
01:46:46,292 --> 01:46:47,125
Hey!

1707
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:49,667
Will you drink vodka
in my sister's birthday party?

1708
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,833
I'll punch you really hard.

1709
01:46:50,917 --> 01:46:52,583
Sagar, please come here.

1710
01:46:52,667 --> 01:46:53,500
Yes.

1711
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:54,750
Please blow up the balloons.

1712
01:46:54,833 --> 01:46:56,792
I hope we didn't forget
sending the invitations.

1713
01:46:57,458 --> 01:46:58,417
No.

1714
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,333
My friend is coming.

1715
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:01,917
Antra.

1716
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:05,000
Is she the one who likes pudding?

1717
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:09,875
Hey, fatty. Do it properly.

1718
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:19,042
Yes!

1719
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:22,125
Smile, please.

1720
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:23,292
Sagar!

1721
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:35,333
Come.

1722
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:39,958
What's she doing here?

1723
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:46,958
I have a beautiful surprise for you.

1724
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,958
Salman Khan.

1725
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:58,417
Sagar is here.

1726
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:04,042
Make way.

1727
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:06,083
Happy birthday, my dear sister.

1728
01:48:06,167 --> 01:48:09,292
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1729
01:48:09,417 --> 01:48:14,458
<i>-Happy birthday, dear Jhanvi
-Happy birthday to you</i>

1730
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:20,458
She's the best one so far.

1731
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,625
Quiet. She's my friend.

1732
01:48:23,833 --> 01:48:26,750
Just a friend? I'm in tenth grade now.

1733
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:30,917
Hey, look here.

1734
01:48:31,375 --> 01:48:33,375
-Come here.
-Yes.

1735
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,500
Yes!

1736
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,083
Sagar. Listen.

1737
01:48:45,167 --> 01:48:47,125
You have it, too. It's nice.

1738
01:48:49,208 --> 01:48:50,375
Now what?

1739
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:52,833
Give it later and spare little for me.

1740
01:48:52,917 --> 01:48:54,417
-Enough.
-Hey, come on.

1741
01:48:54,542 --> 01:48:55,833
Boys, let's go.

1742
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:57,542
Hey.

1743
01:48:57,625 --> 01:48:59,875
<i>What's with all the ego?</i>

1744
01:48:59,958 --> 01:49:01,000
<i>Ego</i>

1745
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:02,250
I can find it on my own.

1746
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:04,667
-It's next to my room.
-Okay.

1747
01:49:04,917 --> 01:49:07,667
-If I can't find it, I have Google Maps.
-Come on, hurry up.

1748
01:49:12,292 --> 01:49:13,333
Take our photo.

1749
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:20,000
<i>You hail from which village, girl?</i>

1750
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:27,125
<i>You hail from which village, girl?</i>

1751
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:30,875
<i>I hail from Gondal</i>

1752
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,042
<i>Let's play now</i>

1753
01:49:40,125 --> 01:49:46,958
<i>It's drizzling
And the clouds are thundering</i>

1754
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:53,583
<i>It's drizzling
And the clouds are thundering</i>

1755
01:49:53,792 --> 01:50:00,125
<i>This heart is restless</i>

1756
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:04,208
<i>This heart is restless</i>

1757
01:50:04,458 --> 01:50:07,750
<i>This heart is restless</i>

1758
01:50:07,833 --> 01:50:14,333
<i>This heart is restless</i>

1759
01:50:14,417 --> 01:50:17,667
<i>It's drizzling</i>

1760
01:50:17,792 --> 01:50:21,208
<i>And the clouds are thundering</i>

1761
01:50:21,292 --> 01:50:28,292
<i>It's drizzling
And the clouds are thundering</i>

1762
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:35,542
<i>You hail from which village, girl?</i>

1763
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:39,667
-Where are you going? Let's dance.
-<i>I come from the village Gondal</i>

1764
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:42,458
<i>You hail from which village, girl?</i>

1765
01:50:42,542 --> 01:50:48,833
<i>You hail from which village, girl?</i>

1766
01:50:48,958 --> 01:50:52,833
<i>You hail from which village, girl?</i>

1767
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:53,917
Antra.

1768
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:55,625
Antra.

1769
01:50:56,292 --> 01:50:57,292
Antra.

1770
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:58,833
Antra!

1771
01:51:02,208 --> 01:51:04,958
If you want my photographs,
tell me next time.

1772
01:51:10,125 --> 01:51:16,375
Every moment in Diu was so special to me.

1773
01:51:17,875 --> 01:51:19,917
Was it just a game for you?

1774
01:51:22,958 --> 01:51:24,125
To be famous?

1775
01:51:26,042 --> 01:51:28,292
Or was it to blackmail me?

1776
01:51:30,792 --> 01:51:31,792
Why?

1777
01:51:33,917 --> 01:51:34,917
Why?

1778
01:51:38,292 --> 01:51:40,542
Swati and I got to know each other
a year ago.

1779
01:51:41,625 --> 01:51:45,292
When she called you,
you told her to break up. And she did.

1780
01:51:47,333 --> 01:51:49,458
Perhaps you won't even remember her name.

1781
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,542
It was also a game to you, right?

1782
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:56,417
But this moment...

1783
01:51:58,625 --> 01:52:00,250
So this was the revenge.

1784
01:52:05,458 --> 01:52:08,333
You've succeeded
in your quest for revenge.

1785
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:15,667
What was her name? Swati, right?

1786
01:52:16,958 --> 01:52:18,792
I seriously don't remember.

1787
01:52:19,875 --> 01:52:25,792
But if Swati really trusted you,
she would not have called me.

1788
01:52:27,667 --> 01:52:30,250
Did you ever ask permission from anyone?

1789
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:33,458
Whether you should love Swati or not,
or whether Swati should love you or not?

1790
01:52:33,542 --> 01:52:34,792
She asked for it.

1791
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:37,542
If not me, someone else
would have given it.

1792
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:42,792
You have no right to decide
what happens in my life.

1793
01:52:46,292 --> 01:52:49,625
What I should or should not do

1794
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,583
From now on, I don't even want
to see your face.

1795
01:53:32,042 --> 01:53:39,042
<i>My heart is on fire</i>

1796
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:49,000
<i>It has lit up the entire city</i>

1797
01:53:53,125 --> 01:54:00,125
<i>My heart yearns for your love</i>

1798
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:13,083
<i>The rest of the world
Is insignificant to me</i>

1799
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,833
<i>Antra.</i>

1800
01:54:22,375 --> 01:54:23,958
What happened? Where are you?

1801
01:54:31,125 --> 01:54:33,833
What are you talking about?
Where are you at the moment?

1802
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:42,333
Everyone is selfish. Everyone.

1803
01:54:43,792 --> 01:54:45,167
Antra, I am coming to you.

1804
01:54:46,042 --> 01:54:48,833
I am not at home.
And I won't even go home.

1805
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:55,417
<i>Antra.</i>

1806
01:55:01,792 --> 01:55:05,708
<i>I kept searching for myself</i>

1807
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:10,542
<i>But always found you</i>

1808
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:17,667
<i>With a heart full of emotions</i>

1809
01:55:20,333 --> 01:55:23,667
<i>You're the companion</i>

1810
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:26,708
<i>Of a long run</i>

1811
01:55:26,917 --> 01:55:31,042
<i>You're the meaning</i>

1812
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:37,167
<i>of my poetry</i>

1813
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,167
<i>Hi, Ahemdabad. This is Antra.</i>

1814
01:55:44,625 --> 01:55:47,208
<i>Actually, I never had a good night.</i>

1815
01:55:47,583 --> 01:55:50,375
I worked all night and couldn't sleep.

1816
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:54,167
So I talked to myself.
I contradicted myself.

1817
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:56,167
And I consoled myself as well.

1818
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:00,292
But let's forget about the anger,
and let's bring smiles on your faces.

1819
01:56:13,958 --> 01:56:15,208
Don't look at me like that. Please.

1820
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:17,375
It's no use asking
what had happened. Right?

1821
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:18,583
Because you won't tell.

1822
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:22,042
That's why I had called you.

1823
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:24,750
Otherwise, it is my problem
and I will deal with it.

1824
01:56:25,792 --> 01:56:28,458
You might not solve a problem
by sharing it,

1825
01:56:29,083 --> 01:56:31,250
but sharing will definitely
make you feel a little bit better.

1826
01:56:31,375 --> 01:56:33,250
All of my problems are inside my heart.

1827
01:56:33,792 --> 01:56:37,000
I wish our heart would come
with a remote control.

1828
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:44,542
Can I ask which channel it is
that you want to switch off?

1829
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:47,250
I'm getting a link, K.

1830
01:56:50,542 --> 01:56:52,708
<i>We give our feelings to someone's heart</i>

1831
01:56:52,792 --> 01:56:55,000
<i>like we're depositing it in a bank,
and when there's a problem,</i>

1832
01:56:55,583 --> 01:56:58,708
<i>we accuse the person as guilty.</i>

1833
01:56:59,292 --> 01:57:02,208
<i>Isn't this wrong, whether it is friendship
or a relationship?</i>

1834
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:04,292
Stop reading the newspaper
and listen to Antra.

1835
01:57:04,375 --> 01:57:06,458
<i>Terms and conditions are always applied
to everything.</i>

1836
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:13,750
Such a famous RJ had come to our house.

1837
01:57:13,875 --> 01:57:15,458
I just can't believe it.

1838
01:57:15,875 --> 01:57:18,875
Aunt Ritu and Kiran had called me up.

1839
01:57:19,333 --> 01:57:22,000
She said that Sagar had celebrity friends.

1840
01:57:22,333 --> 01:57:26,000
She asked me
if Sagar was going to marry her.

1841
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,833
Antra.

1842
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:34,000
I didn't bring my lunch box today.
Shall we go out for lunch today?

1843
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:36,917
Sorry, K. I am not in the mood.

1844
01:57:37,792 --> 01:57:41,250
Oh, I forgot. You're upset.

1845
01:57:41,708 --> 01:57:43,083
So you will go home early.

1846
01:57:43,292 --> 01:57:46,167
Lock yourself up
in your room and cry, right?

1847
01:57:51,708 --> 01:57:52,708
What?

1848
01:57:53,542 --> 01:57:54,917
I want to eat pizza only.

1849
01:57:55,125 --> 01:57:56,208
Nothing else.

1850
01:58:08,083 --> 01:58:09,375
What are you doing here?

1851
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,625
Take this.

1852
01:58:18,333 --> 01:58:19,458
She doesn't use it.

1853
01:58:20,042 --> 01:58:21,458
Give that phone back to me.

1854
01:58:21,542 --> 01:58:23,500
I'm not giving it away. Thank you.

1855
01:58:25,292 --> 01:58:26,625
I am sorry. I was busy.

1856
01:58:29,583 --> 01:58:30,500
Yes, Rupesh.

1857
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:32,542
Yes.

1858
01:58:33,708 --> 01:58:36,250
Please continue.
I have some work to do. Please.

1859
01:58:43,083 --> 01:58:46,583
So how did you have the time
to have lunch on a workday?

1860
01:58:46,792 --> 01:58:48,375
Well, I just finished a meeting.

1861
01:58:58,583 --> 01:59:00,083
Krishna called you, right?

1862
01:59:00,833 --> 01:59:04,833
Don't compromise your work for me,
for lunch, or make an extra effort.

1863
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,000
"I am poor, sad lady."

1864
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:13,958
Have you seen your eyes?

1865
01:59:14,333 --> 01:59:15,708
You didn't sleep last night, did you?

1866
01:59:18,125 --> 01:59:19,167
You cried a lot, right?

1867
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:22,375
This morning, I could tell

1868
01:59:22,458 --> 01:59:25,917
that you were trying
to sound fine on the radio.

1869
01:59:29,667 --> 01:59:32,833
I know you enough to understand
when you're fine and when you are not.

1870
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:36,708
And I think I have the right
to know what happened.

1871
01:59:39,375 --> 01:59:40,333
What do I say?

1872
01:59:41,542 --> 01:59:42,542
What do I say?

1873
01:59:43,708 --> 01:59:45,500
That I made a big mistake?

1874
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:47,542
That I broke my own rules?

1875
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,250
Everyone is selfish in this world.

1876
01:59:54,708 --> 01:59:55,583
And me?

1877
02:00:08,958 --> 02:00:12,750
My trip to Diu is over,
but my emotional trip is still not over.

1878
02:00:37,333 --> 02:00:38,875
Everyone is selfish. Everyone.

1879
02:00:39,958 --> 02:00:42,167
And it's selfish of me
to want to see you happy.

1880
02:00:43,375 --> 02:00:46,292
Seriously. If someone is bothering you,

1881
02:00:47,125 --> 02:00:49,417
then I will run after him

1882
02:00:49,667 --> 02:00:51,375
like the hero of the movie <i>Ghajini</i>.

1883
02:01:00,708 --> 02:01:01,958
Please have some.

1884
02:01:05,958 --> 02:01:10,333
<i>Every day and night</i>

1885
02:01:10,417 --> 02:01:13,708
<i>Every now and then</i>

1886
02:01:14,417 --> 02:01:18,500
<i>I talk</i>

1887
02:01:18,583 --> 02:01:22,083
<i>With your thoughts</i>

1888
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:27,417
<i>Your lively eyes would reveal
All the secrets</i>

1889
02:01:27,625 --> 02:01:29,333
Get the details about this man.

1890
02:01:29,875 --> 02:01:30,792
Quickly.

1891
02:01:30,875 --> 02:01:37,833
<i>I feel myself lost all the time</i>

1892
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:42,708
<i>Come, beloved</i>

1893
02:01:42,792 --> 02:01:47,917
<i>Come, beloved</i>

1894
02:01:48,042 --> 02:01:52,292
<i>It has all started
With the meaning of love</i>

1895
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:58,667
<i>Come, beloved</i>

1896
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:02,458
<i>Come, beloved</i>

1897
02:02:02,542 --> 02:02:06,708
<i>Come and let your heart
Be drenched in this rain</i>

1898
02:02:06,792 --> 02:02:09,125
<i>Come, beloved</i>

1899
02:02:09,208 --> 02:02:12,083
<i>It has all started
With the meaning of love</i>

1900
02:02:12,167 --> 02:02:17,583
<i>It has all started
With the meaning of love</i>

1901
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:31,208
Why does he keep calling me?

1902
02:02:34,875 --> 02:02:36,167
I've reached the client.

1903
02:02:36,292 --> 02:02:38,042
Okay. Shall I send you the photo?

1904
02:02:38,333 --> 02:02:41,500
As proof? At least trust me.

1905
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:57,542
Yes, sir. What's the problem, sir?

1906
02:03:02,458 --> 02:03:03,500
Exactly my question.

1907
02:03:05,458 --> 02:03:06,542
What's the problem?

1908
02:03:07,042 --> 02:03:07,875
What?

1909
02:03:18,167 --> 02:03:19,000
Antra.

1910
02:03:21,333 --> 02:03:23,042
I don't know what happened
between you and Antra

1911
02:03:23,125 --> 02:03:24,542
or what the matter was between you two.

1912
02:03:25,042 --> 02:03:26,417
I don't even want to know.

1913
02:03:28,333 --> 02:03:29,583
I only have one problem.

1914
02:03:31,292 --> 02:03:33,667
I get hurt if Antra is hurt.

1915
02:03:35,333 --> 02:03:36,417
Look, sir.

1916
02:03:37,167 --> 02:03:38,250
It is our personal...

1917
02:03:38,333 --> 02:03:40,792
Those who share personal relations
can be part of the problem.

1918
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:45,000
Keep away from her.

1919
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:48,375
And forget her.

1920
02:03:53,542 --> 02:03:55,167
I've already committed one mistake, sir.

1921
02:03:56,417 --> 02:03:59,958
Now, I won't make another mistake
of forgetting her.

1922
02:05:09,042 --> 02:05:10,833
I have never had ice cream
on the road like this.

1923
02:05:29,667 --> 02:05:32,875
Actually, I'm experienced
in business proposals only.

1924
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:35,583
So I will talk in that manner only.

1925
02:05:37,917 --> 02:05:42,125
If I don't meet you or listen to you,
my life feels empty.

1926
02:05:45,667 --> 02:05:46,875
I get nervous.

1927
02:05:49,167 --> 02:05:50,708
I want your partnership.

1928
02:05:53,125 --> 02:05:57,792
I want to share every small joy
in every season with you.

1929
02:06:01,583 --> 02:06:03,500
I've prepared myself a lot for this.

1930
02:06:07,292 --> 02:06:10,250
I know you had said
that we are just friends.

1931
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:22,833
But I have a simple dream.

1932
02:06:24,167 --> 02:06:25,458
You should be happy. That's it.

1933
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:29,042
Everything that you like,
even if I don't like it,

1934
02:06:29,125 --> 02:06:30,833
it will be part of my life forever.

1935
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,958
I have only one goal.

1936
02:06:35,042 --> 02:06:36,708
After waking up in the morning,
you should feel

1937
02:06:36,792 --> 02:06:38,833
that this is the best day of your life.

1938
02:06:50,458 --> 02:06:51,708
Just change your address.

1939
02:07:30,833 --> 02:07:32,250
<i>This is the lovesick fool.</i>

1940
02:07:36,125 --> 02:07:37,250
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1941
02:07:37,917 --> 02:07:39,667
I didn't call you up
to ask for permission.

1942
02:07:39,792 --> 02:07:41,625
I mean, not yours.

1943
02:07:42,292 --> 02:07:43,583
Then what are you calling for?

1944
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:46,542
Yes, it's my girlfriend.

1945
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:50,333
<i>She ignores me. She doesn't speak to me.</i>

1946
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:54,125
She doesn't reply to my phone calls.

1947
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,583
You must have given her a reason.

1948
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,375
I agree that I've made a mistake.

1949
02:08:03,458 --> 02:08:06,167
But if she wouldn't talk, answer my calls

1950
02:08:06,458 --> 02:08:08,375
or reply to my messages,
how could I find a solution?

1951
02:08:11,042 --> 02:08:11,875
You tell me.

1952
02:08:12,792 --> 02:08:15,167
Not replying is also a reply.

1953
02:08:15,667 --> 02:08:18,625
If you didn't get it,
understand that message.

1954
02:08:19,292 --> 02:08:20,417
<i>Forget everything.</i>

1955
02:08:21,417 --> 02:08:24,875
Days, dates, roads,
I can forget everything.

1956
02:08:26,583 --> 02:08:27,583
But not her.

1957
02:08:27,958 --> 02:08:29,625
Sorry, but we don't have much time, so...

1958
02:08:29,708 --> 02:08:31,792
<i>Just a minute.</i>

1959
02:08:34,042 --> 02:08:36,875
Will you please play this last message
of mine for her?

1960
02:08:38,208 --> 02:08:39,083
I mean...

1961
02:08:39,167 --> 02:08:41,500
<i>she will listen to me wherever she is.</i>

1962
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,333
<i>She's your biggest fan.</i>

1963
02:08:52,833 --> 02:08:55,917
The joy of listening to the songs
through a single earphone.

1964
02:08:57,667 --> 02:08:58,917
I really miss it.

1965
02:09:01,792 --> 02:09:06,625
I also miss the joy of sharing flatbread.

1966
02:09:09,583 --> 02:09:12,625
<i>I look at life
like how I look at software.</i>

1967
02:09:14,458 --> 02:09:15,708
<i>I can't concentrate</i>

1968
02:09:16,292 --> 02:09:17,750
at anything without her.

1969
02:09:19,333 --> 02:09:21,458
My boss tells me to do something
and I do it.

1970
02:09:22,042 --> 02:09:23,958
<i>My boss tells me to do something
and I do it.</i>

1971
02:09:26,583 --> 02:09:27,875
<i>You know what I did?</i>

1972
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:32,458
I kept washing my jeans
with my mobile phone in the pocket.

1973
02:09:34,167 --> 02:09:36,208
I tried to start my bike
using my house key.

1974
02:09:42,083 --> 02:09:43,458
<i>In passwords,</i>

1975
02:09:44,417 --> 02:09:47,458
wallpapers, and conversations...

1976
02:09:48,833 --> 02:09:50,500
<i>Everywhere, it's you.</i>

1977
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,083
<i>It's just that you're not with me.</i>

1978
02:09:58,250 --> 02:10:00,792
I agree, it's my mistake.

1979
02:10:03,958 --> 02:10:09,500
But will you not give me a second chance?

1980
02:10:10,958 --> 02:10:16,250
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1981
02:10:16,917 --> 02:10:22,583
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1982
02:10:22,958 --> 02:10:27,667
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1983
02:10:28,958 --> 02:10:31,500
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1984
02:10:31,583 --> 02:10:35,917
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1985
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:43,708
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1986
02:10:43,792 --> 02:10:46,375
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1987
02:10:46,458 --> 02:10:51,958
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1988
02:10:52,625 --> 02:10:56,208
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

1989
02:10:56,333 --> 02:10:58,542
Is this because of Swati's phone call?

1990
02:11:00,958 --> 02:11:01,792
Antra.

1991
02:11:02,708 --> 02:11:04,333
I don't know what all happened at Diu.

1992
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:06,458
I don't know Sagar.

1993
02:11:07,708 --> 02:11:10,042
But I've never seen you affected so much.

1994
02:11:11,417 --> 02:11:13,125
I don't want to see you like this
in the future.

1995
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:15,333
A life partner should be the one

1996
02:11:15,458 --> 02:11:18,167
who would always make you feel happy
and secure.

1997
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:22,500
According to me,
Aditya is perfect for you.

1998
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:23,958
Aditya.

1999
02:11:26,917 --> 02:11:27,917
What?

2000
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,792
What did you say?

2001
02:11:31,292 --> 02:11:32,208
Nothing.

2002
02:11:37,375 --> 02:11:41,167
But I am not in a right state of mind
to make such a decision.

2003
02:11:42,458 --> 02:11:45,917
I can give infinite reasons
to give say yes to Aditya.

2004
02:11:46,708 --> 02:11:49,167
But give me one reason to refuse him.

2005
02:12:01,208 --> 02:12:04,333
You talk a lot on the radio.

2006
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:08,083
But ever since dinner, I've noticed
that you're very quiet.

2007
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:10,750
-Why?
-It's not that, ma'am.

2008
02:12:10,833 --> 02:12:13,083
Actually, I like to listen to people too.

2009
02:12:13,375 --> 02:12:14,333
Same here.

2010
02:12:14,875 --> 02:12:17,917
Especially stories about you.
Aditya talks a lot about you.

2011
02:12:20,958 --> 02:12:22,083
I am sorry.

2012
02:12:22,208 --> 02:12:23,708
Actually, things happened so suddenly,

2013
02:12:23,792 --> 02:12:25,000
so I had to call Krishna.

2014
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:41,833
Really.

2015
02:12:42,208 --> 02:12:44,667
Before meeting you, I didn't know
the world outside of my laptop.

2016
02:12:55,917 --> 02:12:58,208
Well, I wish we can eat dinner together
every day.

2017
02:13:09,458 --> 02:13:11,333
It's yes from my end.

2018
02:13:12,583 --> 02:13:14,042
-Really?
-Yes.

2019
02:13:14,292 --> 02:13:16,458
If you want I will talk to Aditya
about your proposal.

2020
02:13:17,292 --> 02:13:19,167
If you won't say yes, I will.

2021
02:13:19,292 --> 02:13:20,125
Really.

2022
02:13:24,083 --> 02:13:26,167
<i>A life partner should be the one</i>

2023
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:28,292
<i>who would always make you feel happy
and secure.</i>

2024
02:13:28,542 --> 02:13:29,583
<i>I have only one goal.</i>

2025
02:13:29,667 --> 02:13:31,333
<i>After waking up in the morning,
you should feel</i>

2026
02:13:31,417 --> 02:13:33,500
<i>that this is the best day of your life.</i>

2027
02:13:34,917 --> 02:13:36,458
<i>I want your partnership.</i>

2028
02:13:37,583 --> 02:13:42,333
<i>I want to share every small joy
in every season with you.</i>

2029
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:45,000
<i>Your silence</i>

2030
02:13:46,208 --> 02:13:50,583
<i>Will express your love</i>

2031
02:13:53,333 --> 02:13:56,708
<i>Nights spent sleepless will express</i>

2032
02:13:56,917 --> 02:14:01,667
<i>Some things that are yet unspoken</i>

2033
02:14:03,667 --> 02:14:10,667
<i>Let me remain besotted</i>

2034
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:16,625
<i>It's the state of mind
Let it enjoy this state</i>

2035
02:14:18,167 --> 02:14:21,208
<i>I happen to come across you</i>

2036
02:14:21,333 --> 02:14:27,833
<i>I happen to smile
I happen to call you often</i>

2037
02:14:28,208 --> 02:14:29,042
Mom.

2038
02:14:29,708 --> 02:14:30,625
Tell me.

2039
02:14:31,333 --> 02:14:32,167
Antra.

2040
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:33,667
I don't want to listen now.

2041
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:34,833
Hey.

2042
02:14:35,917 --> 02:14:41,167
<i>I happen to smile
I happen to call you often</i>

2043
02:14:41,375 --> 02:14:42,708
Oh, my God!

2044
02:14:45,542 --> 02:14:47,917
<i>Without you, Shyam</i>

2045
02:14:48,042 --> 02:14:49,000
Where's Sagar?

2046
02:14:49,333 --> 02:14:50,625
-Here he is.
-What happened?

2047
02:14:50,833 --> 02:14:51,667
Sagar,

2048
02:14:52,875 --> 02:14:54,208
Antra is engaged.

2049
02:15:03,167 --> 02:15:05,542
Ma'am, Mr. Sagar is here.

2050
02:15:06,042 --> 02:15:08,250
He said he will not leave
without meeting Antra.

2051
02:15:09,708 --> 02:15:10,625
Sagar?

2052
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:17,208
Krishna.

2053
02:15:17,792 --> 02:15:18,792
I'm Antra's boss.

2054
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:23,333
I want to speak to Antra only.

2055
02:15:24,375 --> 02:15:26,333
How much more will you trouble her?

2056
02:15:28,167 --> 02:15:29,917
I want to meet her once more. Please.

2057
02:15:30,208 --> 02:15:32,375
She's going to start a new life.

2058
02:15:33,667 --> 02:15:35,417
She was deeply hurt after so many years.

2059
02:15:36,208 --> 02:15:39,375
If you really want to see her happy,
then stay away from her.

2060
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:41,375
Noe one can make her happier
more than I can.

2061
02:15:42,042 --> 02:15:44,583
No one can hurt her more than you.

2062
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:47,083
She accepted this marriage proposal.

2063
02:15:47,792 --> 02:15:49,167
She wasn't pressured by anyone.

2064
02:15:50,542 --> 02:15:52,375
She doesn't wish to be with you.

2065
02:15:53,542 --> 02:15:55,792
So stay away from her, please.

2066
02:16:09,542 --> 02:16:11,625
FOR ANTRA

2067
02:16:18,875 --> 02:16:21,208
<i>Because you've been ignoring
my phone calls and my messages,</i>

2068
02:16:21,625 --> 02:16:24,125
<i>I thought of trying
an old-fashioned letter.</i>

2069
02:16:25,167 --> 02:16:26,625
<i>It will be delivered without my name</i>

2070
02:16:26,708 --> 02:16:28,458
<i>so you can at least read it.</i>

2071
02:16:29,917 --> 02:16:31,583
<i>I have nothing else to say, Antra.</i>

2072
02:16:32,875 --> 02:16:34,292
<i>I just want to give you a dare.</i>

2073
02:16:35,375 --> 02:16:36,292
<i>One last dare.</i>

2074
02:16:37,417 --> 02:16:38,958
<i>Answer my three questions.</i>

2075
02:16:43,375 --> 02:16:45,208
<i>Does he make you laugh the most?</i>

2076
02:16:46,667 --> 02:16:49,833
<i>Do you think about me
when you're with him?</i>

2077
02:16:51,292 --> 02:16:52,458
<i>Who do you remember</i>

2078
02:16:52,542 --> 02:16:55,833
<i>when Arijit Singh's song
is playing on the radio?</i>

2079
02:16:57,958 --> 02:17:00,583
<i>It's okay if you don't tell me
your answer to these questions.</i>

2080
02:17:02,167 --> 02:17:03,583
<i>Just answer them to yourself.</i>

2081
02:17:05,833 --> 02:17:07,917
<i>The box contains garlic bread with cheese.</i>

2082
02:17:08,458 --> 02:17:09,708
<i>Both are made for each other.</i>

2083
02:17:11,375 --> 02:17:13,958
<i>With right combination,
life becomes tasty.</i>

2084
02:17:14,042 --> 02:17:18,208
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

2085
02:17:18,833 --> 02:17:25,417
<i>I've become crazy for you</i>

2086
02:17:36,583 --> 02:17:38,667
Tell me. Which do you think is the best?

2087
02:17:39,333 --> 02:17:40,750
All of them are beautiful but this one.

2088
02:17:42,333 --> 02:17:43,583
You know what?

2089
02:17:44,125 --> 02:17:46,625
This is my favorite color.

2090
02:17:48,833 --> 02:17:51,875
That's it. You will perform the rituals
while wearing this saree.

2091
02:17:57,667 --> 02:17:59,208
Who would do it if not you?

2092
02:17:59,583 --> 02:18:03,458
You always act like my mom, anyway.

2093
02:18:03,583 --> 02:18:05,292
So you must do this too.

2094
02:18:09,917 --> 02:18:11,917
No melodrama, please.

2095
02:18:12,042 --> 02:18:13,500
I told you a lot of times

2096
02:18:13,583 --> 02:18:16,125
to stop watching
those soap operas, please.

2097
02:18:21,042 --> 02:18:23,542
RJ ANTRA, WHO SOLVED THE PROBLEMS
OF PEOPLE IN LOVE, IS IN LOVE

2098
02:18:24,542 --> 02:18:25,708
-Sagar.
-Yes.

2099
02:18:26,208 --> 02:18:28,208
-Son.
-Yes, I know.

2100
02:18:28,792 --> 02:18:29,667
These days,

2101
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:32,542
WhatsApp is faster at showing news
compared to the papers.

2102
02:18:33,417 --> 02:18:34,917
But what happened all of a sudden?

2103
02:18:35,958 --> 02:18:36,958
It was my mistake.

2104
02:18:38,167 --> 02:18:39,375
I deserve this.

2105
02:18:40,708 --> 02:18:42,958
Now, I just want to see her happy,

2106
02:18:44,083 --> 02:18:47,042
with me or without me.

2107
02:18:48,958 --> 02:18:49,917
Bye.

2108
02:19:02,417 --> 02:19:03,625
Look at the time.

2109
02:19:03,750 --> 02:19:06,375
-Why?
-I have the morning show.

2110
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:10,667
Unlike you, I am not my own boss.

2111
02:19:22,125 --> 02:19:23,292
Let me just change.

2112
02:19:23,417 --> 02:19:24,542
Please be quick.

2113
02:20:11,625 --> 02:20:13,000
Shall we go?

2114
02:20:26,875 --> 02:20:29,250
I hope you're not taking this decision
under any pressure.

2115
02:20:29,583 --> 02:20:32,500
I mean, you're making this decision
from your heart. Right?

2116
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,917
Is there anything bothering you?

2117
02:20:38,292 --> 02:20:39,833
I mean, any tension?

2118
02:20:40,167 --> 02:20:42,750
It's just that all of this
is happening very quickly.

2119
02:20:45,917 --> 02:20:47,667
This is a big change for me.

2120
02:20:50,917 --> 02:20:53,000
If you want, we can postpone the date.

2121
02:20:53,583 --> 02:20:54,625
No.

2122
02:20:56,292 --> 02:20:58,375
There's no reason to postpone the date.

2123
02:20:59,833 --> 02:21:01,667
Antra, don't forget
that we are friends first.

2124
02:21:07,292 --> 02:21:08,875
You can share anything with me.

2125
02:21:51,917 --> 02:21:56,458
<i>No, I don't know</i>

2126
02:21:56,542 --> 02:22:00,333
<i>Why I am searching</i>

2127
02:22:01,042 --> 02:22:04,667
<i>Your name</i>

2128
02:22:04,750 --> 02:22:09,250
<i>In my henna pattern?</i>

2129
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,583
What's with that look?

2130
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,250
Do you want to say something?

2131
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:18,917
Who? Aditya?

2132
02:22:24,292 --> 02:22:25,125
Yes, tell me.

2133
02:22:25,208 --> 02:22:26,917
There's a problem.

2134
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:27,833
<i>What problem?</i>

2135
02:22:28,417 --> 02:22:31,125
-Those photographs of you and Antra.
<i>-Yes.</i>

2136
02:22:32,083 --> 02:22:35,292
My Boss wants to publish them tomorrow.

2137
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:38,042
On the day of Antra's marriage,

2138
02:22:38,708 --> 02:22:40,167
<i>there will be news about this.</i>

2139
02:23:00,792 --> 02:23:01,833
Mehul, come here.

2140
02:23:02,125 --> 02:23:03,458
Sagar. Tell me.

2141
02:23:03,542 --> 02:23:05,250
Antra is troubled enough because of me.

2142
02:23:05,333 --> 02:23:06,458
-Yes.
-But not now.

2143
02:23:06,542 --> 02:23:07,417
Okay, but what to do.

2144
02:23:07,542 --> 02:23:09,875
Do whatever you have to.
But they must not be published.

2145
02:23:10,042 --> 02:23:12,458
Tell me. Where is his office?

2146
02:23:13,958 --> 02:23:14,792
Come.

2147
02:23:15,667 --> 02:23:20,292
<i>Every passing moment</i>

2148
02:23:20,375 --> 02:23:24,083
<i>Is becoming heavier</i>

2149
02:23:24,875 --> 02:23:29,667
<i>This heart wants to go</i>

2150
02:23:29,875 --> 02:23:33,792
<i>Far away from this decoration</i>

2151
02:23:51,583 --> 02:23:56,208
<i>Come, beloved</i>

2152
02:23:56,417 --> 02:24:02,083
<i>Come and awaken desires</i>

2153
02:24:11,667 --> 02:24:17,875
<i>Come, beloved</i>

2154
02:24:19,958 --> 02:24:21,542
Now can you still publish the photos?

2155
02:24:30,250 --> 02:24:31,167
Completely?

2156
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:34,875
The system has crashed.

2157
02:24:38,083 --> 02:24:39,042
A challenge.

2158
02:24:39,875 --> 02:24:43,667
Over here, I have the final say
and the final decisions.

2159
02:24:45,917 --> 02:24:48,333
What were you doing? Playing a video game?

2160
02:24:48,542 --> 02:24:49,458
Yes.

2161
02:24:50,542 --> 02:24:51,542
Which one?

2162
02:24:56,417 --> 02:24:57,500
A challenge.

2163
02:24:58,375 --> 02:24:59,417
Mehul.

2164
02:24:59,833 --> 02:25:01,417
Did you forget?

2165
02:25:01,708 --> 02:25:04,833
I always carry a backup.

2166
02:25:08,125 --> 02:25:09,958
I have the original photos here.

2167
02:25:10,875 --> 02:25:12,958
Okay, now go away and do your job.

2168
02:25:16,833 --> 02:25:18,875
Mehul, hold him.

2169
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,750
Hold him. Mehul.

2170
02:25:21,833 --> 02:25:23,958
Attack him!

2171
02:25:24,042 --> 02:25:27,833
<i>The top turns round and round</i>

2172
02:25:28,750 --> 02:25:30,875
-Where are you running?
-Catch him!

2173
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,333
-Hey!
-<i>The top turns round and round</i>

2174
02:25:34,542 --> 02:25:35,750
He's the minister's son.

2175
02:25:36,042 --> 02:25:41,333
-Get him!
-<i>It turns round and round</i>

2176
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:57,667
Your room is that way.

2177
02:25:58,375 --> 02:25:59,458
Do you know?

2178
02:25:59,875 --> 02:26:00,917
What?

2179
02:26:01,625 --> 02:26:02,875
You know everything.

2180
02:26:03,583 --> 02:26:04,542
What?

2181
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,083
I want to meet Antra. Right now.

2182
02:26:08,167 --> 02:26:10,458
Wait for a while, and then you'll have
your whole life together.

2183
02:26:10,542 --> 02:26:12,250
I'm worried about our life together.

2184
02:26:13,667 --> 02:26:14,667
Right now.

2185
02:26:15,917 --> 02:26:18,083
Both of you are going to be married
to each other soon.

2186
02:26:19,167 --> 02:26:21,958
-The guests are here.
-That's what I'm saying.

2187
02:26:49,292 --> 02:26:50,167
Krishna,

2188
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:53,958
I want to say something to you.

2189
02:26:55,125 --> 02:26:56,875
And I want to hear something from you.

2190
02:27:06,833 --> 02:27:08,208
-Aditya.
-Just a minute.

2191
02:27:12,833 --> 02:27:14,333
You can answer people without meeting them

2192
02:27:15,083 --> 02:27:18,292
or without even seeing them.

2193
02:27:19,625 --> 02:27:21,292
You can read everyone's mind.

2194
02:27:25,875 --> 02:27:27,417
But not your own?

2195
02:27:31,875 --> 02:27:33,542
Antra, will you play a game with me too?

2196
02:27:35,333 --> 02:27:36,542
Truth or dare?

2197
02:27:47,125 --> 02:27:49,417
Antra, when you wake up
and when you go to sleep,

2198
02:27:49,542 --> 02:27:51,083
whose face do you wish to see?

2199
02:28:00,250 --> 02:28:01,792
I just want to see you happy.

2200
02:28:04,625 --> 02:28:06,417
It doesn't matter
if you're happy with someone else.

2201
02:28:20,208 --> 02:28:22,083
Actually, you will not be comfortable
in those heels.

2202
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,125
These will be more comfortable.

2203
02:28:51,750 --> 02:28:52,792
Give me the key.

2204
02:29:11,667 --> 02:29:12,833
Where do you want to go?

2205
02:29:25,708 --> 02:29:27,417
Why won't he pick up the phone?

2206
02:29:28,750 --> 02:29:29,958
Do you have his home number?

2207
02:29:30,042 --> 02:29:31,167
Oh, right.

2208
02:29:39,250 --> 02:29:42,208
Hello. Is Sagar there?
He isn't receiving my calls.

2209
02:29:42,875 --> 02:29:44,792
He isn't receiving my calls as well.

2210
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:47,542
Just a minute.

2211
02:29:48,333 --> 02:29:52,167
Antra, you were supposed
to get married today, right?

2212
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:54,958
Yes, but it's a long story.
I will tell you when we meet.

2213
02:30:05,083 --> 02:30:06,667
Tell Ahmedabad to find him.

2214
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:21,458
<i>RJ Antra escaped
with the famous businessman </i>

2215
02:30:21,542 --> 02:30:24,917
<i>and her fiancé, Aditya,
before their marriage.</i>

2216
02:30:44,667 --> 02:30:45,542
Antra!

2217
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:57,375
-Krishna.
<i>-Yes, Vishal.</i>

2218
02:30:58,833 --> 02:30:59,667
What?

2219
02:30:59,792 --> 02:31:01,375
<i>Yes, she's on-air.</i>

2220
02:31:02,167 --> 02:31:03,958
She came in here
wearing her wedding dress.

2221
02:31:08,292 --> 02:31:11,042
I have to listen to the radio.

2222
02:31:14,167 --> 02:31:15,792
This is Antra on Love Line.

2223
02:31:17,958 --> 02:31:19,458
I know I've come at the wrong time.

2224
02:31:19,583 --> 02:31:21,000
But that's the point.

2225
02:31:21,083 --> 02:31:23,125
It's not that the timing is wrong,
it's the situation.

2226
02:31:23,208 --> 02:31:26,167
And me? Being the victim of the situation,
and without asking the priest,

2227
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:29,000
<i>I've come here in my wedding dress
to find my real groom</i>

2228
02:31:29,292 --> 02:31:31,833
with my best friend

2229
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:36,417
<i>Every time you faced a problem
in your love life,</i>

2230
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:38,042
you people have called me.

2231
02:31:38,583 --> 02:31:40,292
But today, I need you.

2232
02:31:41,083 --> 02:31:42,375
Will you help me, Ahmedabad,

2233
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:43,750
to look for him?

2234
02:32:00,583 --> 02:32:02,500
<i>What does your groom look like?</i>

2235
02:32:03,625 --> 02:32:05,875
He's a strange one, a unique one.

2236
02:32:06,208 --> 02:32:09,417
<i>God must have thought
that he made so many normal people,</i>

2237
02:32:09,542 --> 02:32:12,083
that he should make
a strange and unique one.

2238
02:32:12,292 --> 02:32:13,708
That's why God must have created him.

2239
02:32:15,208 --> 02:32:18,250
It will be difficult to find him
from that description.

2240
02:32:18,917 --> 02:32:22,208
Okay. His height is around 5'10".

2241
02:32:22,333 --> 02:32:23,583
And his body...

2242
02:32:24,083 --> 02:32:26,083
<i>you can say that he's healthy.</i>

2243
02:32:26,917 --> 02:32:29,708
He keeps fixing his hair
and biting his nails.

2244
02:32:30,125 --> 02:32:31,458
<i>He rides a bike.</i>

2245
02:32:31,833 --> 02:32:34,667
And jokes, he likes telling jokes.

2246
02:32:35,625 --> 02:32:36,792
If you tell more than one joke,

2247
02:32:36,875 --> 02:32:38,833
you feel like laughing
in the way that he's laughing.

2248
02:32:39,417 --> 02:32:41,000
<i>If you find any clues,</i>

2249
02:32:41,083 --> 02:32:43,667
then please, Ahmedabad,
please call me immediately.

2250
02:32:46,042 --> 02:32:47,667
<i>Aunt, has Sagar come home?</i>

2251
02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:49,000
No, not yet.

2252
02:32:49,542 --> 02:32:51,958
<i>Aunt, turn the radio on. Antra is on-air.</i>

2253
02:32:52,250 --> 02:32:53,083
Okay.

2254
02:32:57,500 --> 02:33:00,375
<i>Hello, Antra. I can see someone
with that description.</i>

2255
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:03,625
Okay, can you describe him?

2256
02:33:04,083 --> 02:33:06,917
<i>He has oily hair
and is sitting on his bike.</i>

2257
02:33:08,083 --> 02:33:10,458
-And?
<i>-And he is smoking.</i>

2258
02:33:11,292 --> 02:33:13,083
No. He doesn't smoke.

2259
02:33:13,458 --> 02:33:14,542
He only drinks tea.

2260
02:33:15,625 --> 02:33:16,583
Kettle tea.

2261
02:33:17,667 --> 02:33:19,792
<i>If anyone listening is near a tea vendor,</i>

2262
02:33:19,958 --> 02:33:21,208
then please look around.

2263
02:33:21,292 --> 02:33:22,500
<i>He must be around there.</i>

2264
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:27,333
<i>Antra.</i>

2265
02:33:27,542 --> 02:33:28,792
RJ Antra?

2266
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:31,250
<i>Yes, I am RJ Antra. Tell me.</i>

2267
02:33:31,542 --> 02:33:35,208
<i>Antra, I am your biggest fan.</i>

2268
02:33:35,833 --> 02:33:39,833
Only your station is played
at my tea shop all day.

2269
02:33:40,667 --> 02:33:43,500
Sir, thank you very much
for listening to me every day.

2270
02:33:44,083 --> 02:33:47,458
But right now, please help me find
the one I am looking for.

2271
02:33:47,708 --> 02:33:50,250
That's why I called you.

2272
02:33:50,417 --> 02:33:54,125
<i>One boy has been sitting here</i>
<i>for the past three or four hours.</i>

2273
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,458
<i>His height and body
match your description.</i>

2274
02:33:56,667 --> 02:33:58,792
He's wearing jeans.

2275
02:33:59,042 --> 02:34:00,292
What else he is doing?

2276
02:34:00,417 --> 02:34:02,625
<i>This is the fifth cup of tea</i>

2277
02:34:02,708 --> 02:34:03,542
that he's having.

2278
02:34:03,917 --> 02:34:06,083
And he's sitting very quietly.

2279
02:34:06,333 --> 02:34:07,625
Is he shaking his legs?

2280
02:34:07,833 --> 02:34:09,875
Yes. He is shaking his legs.

2281
02:34:10,125 --> 02:34:12,583
<i>And also biting nails.</i>

2282
02:34:12,708 --> 02:34:14,500
Sir, please let me hear his voice.

2283
02:34:14,917 --> 02:34:17,667
<i>How do I do this, my dear?</i>

2284
02:34:19,042 --> 02:34:20,000
Wait a minute.

2285
02:34:21,125 --> 02:34:22,792
<i>Let me try.</i>

2286
02:34:23,708 --> 02:34:25,083
<i>Please, hold.</i>

2287
02:34:29,375 --> 02:34:33,083
Listen, shall I bring piping hot tea
for you?

2288
02:34:36,792 --> 02:34:38,333
Do you want bread-butter?

2289
02:34:39,458 --> 02:34:41,167
Sir. Sir, listen.

2290
02:34:41,417 --> 02:34:43,250
Ask him if he will eat flatbread.

2291
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,917
Listen, I make the best flatbread.

2292
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:51,000
You will never get to eat
such tasty flatbread anywhere else.

2293
02:34:51,583 --> 02:34:54,625
My mom's flatbread is the world's best.

2294
02:34:59,167 --> 02:35:00,667
Make him stay there, sir.

2295
02:35:01,458 --> 02:35:02,542
<i>I am coming.</i>

2296
02:35:02,958 --> 02:35:03,958
<i>Where are you at the moment?</i>

2297
02:35:07,417 --> 02:35:08,583
I am coming, sir.

2298
02:35:20,625 --> 02:35:21,833
How much is the bill?

2299
02:35:22,292 --> 02:35:25,250
Don't worry about the money.

2300
02:35:25,375 --> 02:35:27,000
Take this.

2301
02:35:27,125 --> 02:35:32,292
Drink this special tea I've made.
And you will be all right.

2302
02:35:32,375 --> 02:35:34,583
I don't want to drink your tea.
Just tell me how much.

2303
02:35:34,833 --> 02:35:37,042
Eight years have passed.

2304
02:35:37,167 --> 02:35:41,792
In the evening, people line up
to have tea at my stall.

2305
02:35:41,917 --> 02:35:45,333
Yesterday, my wife complained
about my tea.

2306
02:35:49,458 --> 02:35:51,667
I mean, if somebody told
the superstar actor

2307
02:35:51,750 --> 02:35:54,750
that he can't deliver the lines,

2308
02:35:54,875 --> 02:35:56,542
wouldn't he lose his temper?

2309
02:35:56,625 --> 02:35:59,917
Wouldn't I lose my temper
if someone complained about my tea?

2310
02:36:00,708 --> 02:36:02,917
All right. Please, spare me.

2311
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,042
Let me go.

2312
02:36:04,167 --> 02:36:05,875
Yes, but please have some tea first.

2313
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,792
Do it for me. Please drink this tea.

2314
02:36:07,875 --> 02:36:10,708
I don't want to have your tea. I am done.

2315
02:36:18,292 --> 02:36:19,583
Why is the media here?

2316
02:36:23,667 --> 02:36:27,083
Have some tea for my sake.

2317
02:36:27,292 --> 02:36:28,375
Quickly.

2318
02:36:28,458 --> 02:36:32,458
I never insist people to drink my tea
for the wrong reasons.

2319
02:36:32,583 --> 02:36:34,667
And I don't allow others to do it either.

2320
02:36:34,792 --> 02:36:36,292
Drink this. Drink it.

2321
02:36:36,583 --> 02:36:39,000
-Take it.
-Sagar!

2322
02:36:39,083 --> 02:36:46,083
<i>Come, beloved</i>

2323
02:36:46,625 --> 02:36:53,625
<i>Memories have</i>

2324
02:36:56,625 --> 02:37:03,083
<i>Started fading</i>

2325
02:37:03,917 --> 02:37:10,333
<i>My world is completed</i>

2326
02:37:10,417 --> 02:37:15,208
<i>With you in my life</i>

2327
02:37:15,458 --> 02:37:17,125
I came here to breakup

2328
02:37:19,792 --> 02:37:22,417
with Sagar who has hurt me,

2329
02:37:23,792 --> 02:37:25,000
and who has lied to me.

2330
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:28,958
I want to forget that Sagar.

2331
02:37:31,167 --> 02:37:32,500
I want the Sagar

2332
02:37:33,875 --> 02:37:35,708
who is like his mom's flatbread.

2333
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:46,417
He drinks tea, but he's like coffee.

2334
02:37:49,500 --> 02:37:50,958
It's like he's part of my life.

2335
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,708
You can't even handle two pegs.

2336
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:02,833
Will you be able to handle me?

2337
02:38:22,625 --> 02:38:24,375
I was very upset earlier.

2338
02:38:26,083 --> 02:38:28,750
My 24 ex-girlfriends used to ignore me
for an entire day.

2339
02:38:28,833 --> 02:38:30,583
And then you came into my life.

2340
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:34,292
My life became colorful.

2341
02:38:37,083 --> 02:38:38,958
Now, it will be colorful.

2342
02:38:39,958 --> 02:38:42,833
Will you go on the scariest adventure
of the world with me?

2343
02:38:43,167 --> 02:38:44,958
I'm scared of adventures.

2344
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:51,208
Will you marry me?

2345
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,833
Let me ask my mom. Wait a minute.

2346
02:39:00,958 --> 02:39:02,583
Where's my mobile? My mobile.

2347
02:39:02,667 --> 02:39:03,625
Sagar.

2348
02:39:06,042 --> 02:39:08,292
Allow me to take your photographs
and then I'll give this back.

2349
02:39:10,958 --> 02:39:11,917
Just a minute.

2350
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:15,833
Take my photo first. Take my selfie.

2351
02:39:15,958 --> 02:39:19,375
Antra, I made your groom stay here.

2352
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:22,542
I forced him. He wanted to leave.

2353
02:39:22,917 --> 02:39:26,458
Sir, if you take a photo with her,

2354
02:39:26,583 --> 02:39:28,667
the headlines tomorrow will say

2355
02:39:28,917 --> 02:39:30,792
that she ran away with the priest.

2356
02:39:30,917 --> 02:39:33,625
Shut up. Don't laugh.

2357
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:35,417
-Mehul.
-Yes.

2358
02:39:35,667 --> 02:39:38,250
Take everyone's photos later.

2359
02:39:39,708 --> 02:39:43,083
Take a photo of me and him first.
I've been a longtime fan of his.

2360
02:39:54,083 --> 02:39:55,583
-Do you remember my words?
-Yes.

2361
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:58,125
If Antra is bothered...

2362
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:00,542
Then you will be bothered, I remember.

2363
02:40:05,208 --> 02:40:06,750
I will call you anytime for coffee.

2364
02:40:08,208 --> 02:40:09,333
But I will drive.

2365
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:17,000
<i>And Antra's real adventure began now.</i>

2366
02:40:17,375 --> 02:40:18,833
<i>Not an adventure of falling in love,</i>

2367
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,458
<i>but an adventure of flying in love.</i>

2368
02:40:20,833 --> 02:40:22,750
<i>Now, she has two wings.</i>

2369
02:40:23,208 --> 02:40:26,958
<i>If you believe that love
is only about being with someone,</i>

2370
02:40:27,250 --> 02:40:30,792
<i>then you will never understand
the true meaning of it.</i>
