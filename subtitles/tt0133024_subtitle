1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,458
There are different Kinds of
creatures on this God's earth

3
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:18,792
But Mr. Ranjit who lives in this
house has a strange mentality

4
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:24,250
He believes that as a mosquito
is born just to suck blood,

5
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:28,792
A fly has been created to sit
on dung and spread diseases

6
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,083
The poor ones are also like them

7
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:36,708
They have been created only to
make trouble for the rich ones

8
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,042
That's why this rich gentleman
hates them very very much

9
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,582
Bloody fool! Why do you always
Keep your hand underneath my foot

10
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,540
I am sorry, Sir

11
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:10,208
Bloody low-class poor!

12
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,290
Be careful, sir!

13
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,208
Hey, you touched me! No

14
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,791
You dared to touch me!

15
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,415
Sir, you might have tripped

16
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:21,458
So what? My head would have
broken, but why did you touch me?

17
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,832
Idiot! Rascal, get out of here

18
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:30,250
Listen Bahadur, arrange
for some water and dettol

19
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,249
Oh, my goodness!

20
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,875
I had to take a real bath
to Kill the odor of poverty

21
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,624
Eh, pass me the rye bread

22
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,749
Hurry up

23
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,958
Keep at a distance

24
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,542
Get out, scoot

25
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,249
Who is it?

26
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,749
Who is this insolent fellow?

27
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,290
I am your brother-in-law

28
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,916
Brother-in-law!

29
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:01,708
Why are you spraying?
This is a dining table, not a gutter

30
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,874
I am doing it for your health

31
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,749
What do you mean?

32
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,416
You had to take a shower
because a poor guy touched you

33
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,833
This food also has been cooked by a poor man

34
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,791
I don't want those germs to enter your body

35
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,374
Did you eat this? Yes

36
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,332
You ate it?!

37
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,083
Open your mouth

38
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:20,958
What are you doing?

39
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,457
I am Killing the germs of poverty

40
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,499
Get out of here

41
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,832
No! Why?

42
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,041
Do you remember my sister's last words?

43
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,166
What did she say?

44
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,416
She said I must stay here till your death

45
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,625
So until I cremate you,
have taken of your ashes,

46
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,833
I won't leave this house

47
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,332
I won't

48
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,624
Oh, my late wife!
You went away to heaven,

49
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,917
but have left behind this hell for me

50
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,083
Abdul, get the car ready

51
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:49,666
Where are you going? To suicide

52
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:50,999
I'll come too For what?

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,542
I don't trust you. I don't believe you

54
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,834
Now let's meet Mr. Harbans
who lives in this house

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,707
As far as "Hatred for poor" is concerned

56
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,999
he is ten steps ahead of our Mr. Ranjit

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,582
The popular slogan goes;
"Eradicate Poverty"

58
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:17,000
But he says, "Eradicate The Poor"

59
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,250
KulKarni, those worms!
Those bloody poor people

60
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,084
Did they vacate the land where
I wish to have a five-star hotel?

61
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,332
Sir, Ms. Madhu stopped us

62
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,582
She said her friend lived there

63
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,583
Damn it! Madhu's poor friend! I hate her

64
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,208
Oh, Brijesh, it's you!
Aren't you supposed to be in Germany?

65
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:46,000
Actually my daughter Rama... Is she alright?

66
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,833
She is absolutely fine

67
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,000
Rama dear, come here

68
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,875
Your daughter got married and you
didn't even inform your elder brother!

69
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:02,333
They loved each other so
I had to get them married

70
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:08,208
What about his status? Is
he from an affluent family?

71
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,332
I must tell you the truth

72
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,791
He is my driver's son

73
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,791
What? It's true

74
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:18,333
No! No!

75
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,875
The family which selects
even its pets by pedigree,

76
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:27,250
the son-in-law of that family is a driver's son!

77
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:31,542
How dare you come in front of me?

78
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,750
If it were my daughter I would have Killed her

79
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:40,625
Before I do the same, get the hell out of here

80
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,874
Take this garbage with you

81
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,207
Don't ever show your faces again

82
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,708
Now get out

83
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,916
Relax, brother

84
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:53,458
I just brought them over to get your blessings

85
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:58,959
Anyway, it's okay

86
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,499
But before leaving, I must say something

87
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,417
Don't be so proud and haughty
Everything has it's downfall

88
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,249
Even the Sun and the Moon have eclipses

89
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,708
We are only humans

90
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,249
Someday you may find y
our self facing the same situation

91
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,165
Because you have a young daughter too

92
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,749
God bless you, brother

93
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,290
God bless you

94
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,917
Because you also have a daughter

95
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,709
No! It will never happen to me. Never

96
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,040
Why did you stop?

97
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,124
It's a "No Entry", sir

98
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:50,875
To hell with it. Just go ahead

99
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:58,083
Who the idiot is violating traffic laws?

100
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,416
Tell that creep to move his car back

101
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,708
Move back

102
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,750
Who is this chicken shit?
Let me have a look

103
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,957
Move your car, or I'll break your head

104
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:13,541
YOU move back otherwise...

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,165
Hey, Harbu, it's you!

106
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:25,417
Oh, Ranjit!

107
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,667
You haven't changed a bit in 20 odd years

108
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:36,416
You were bald then, you're bald now

109
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,999
Neither have you changed

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,458
You were dark then, and so are you today

111
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,583
What a strange coincidence!

112
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:53,417
We happen to live in the same city
and yet have never met each other

113
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:55,374
But today we meet

114
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,583
Come with me Where to?

115
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:00,499
I'm going to see a girl for my son

116
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,040
That's very good

117
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,915
Which family is she from?

118
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,332
She's a daughter of the textile tycoon,
Mr. Brijesh

119
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,583
What?

120
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,791
Mr. Brijesh!

121
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,416
It'd be better if you didn't Why?

122
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,499
He happens to be my younger brother

123
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,916
And his daughter married his driver's son

124
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:18,915
What?

125
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,833
Yeah, it's true

126
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,292
Our Kids can also make the same mistake

127
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,041
We must find a way

128
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,374
Come with me Where?

129
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,082
To the office of barrister GoKhale

130
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,416
I understand your problem

131
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,207
But there's nothing I can do

132
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:40,417
When the children come of age,
they can marry whoever they want

133
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:46,333
And no law, no institution can stop them

134
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,374
That's why I have come to you

135
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:53,750
To stop my daughter from
marrying any Tom, Dick or Harry

136
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:59,083
If it happens, I would have no
choice but to commit suicide

137
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,792
You must find a way to stop it

138
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,916
Money is not the criteria here

139
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:13,083
You rich people really Know
how to get your work done

140
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:18,041
Anyway, I've to find a way-out

141
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,709
Here is a marriage certificate

142
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,416
What's it for?

143
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,584
You get your daughter's signature on it

144
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,667
And if she asks why?

145
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,457
She sure will

146
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:41,083
You have to get it somehow

147
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,749
Is that so!

148
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,166
Okay, I will

149
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:45,999
Then what?

150
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,791
And then get the signature
of the chosen boy here

151
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,416
I see. And then?

152
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:56,375
Signatures of five witnesses. And I'd
then get it endorsed by the registrar

153
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:57,249
Then?

154
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,541
Then Bingo

155
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:03,208
They would be legally married

156
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,541
Oh, you are a genius!

157
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,583
Ranjit, he is simply a genius

158
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,541
Here is a cheque

159
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,416
Blank cheque

160
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,249
Fill in the amount yourself

161
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,082
Here is my blank cheque too

162
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,082
Get me a marriage certificate as well

163
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,332
Why not

164
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,124
Why do you need it?

165
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,332
We are in the same boat

166
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,625
My son is a living example of virtue

167
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:49,332
What's this guy doing!

168
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,207
Mr. Clown, let the show begin

169
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:56,500
Onlookers, Applauders, suckers, friends

170
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,624
Wow, what a darling!

171
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,832
Get lost

172
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,374
This here is lizard oil

173
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,915
Miracle cure lizard oil

174
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,500
Works on any ailment or illness

175
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,249
Just rub it on the affected part

176
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,915
And one thing more, friends

177
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,541
The oil seller is not an ordinary person

178
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:19,707
He is the son of millionaire Mr. Ranjit

179
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,624
A Millionaire's son!

180
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,249
Son of THE Mr. Ranjit!

181
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,041
Shameless! Idiot!

182
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:31,667
How dare you sell lizard
oil in front of my office?

183
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,875
You are disgracing me

184
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:39,125
He is Mr. Ranjit. A big hand for him

185
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:46,375
If you stop my pocket
money I've no other choice

186
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,708
I don't care but don't do it in front of my office

187
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,666
Throw his stuff away

188
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:03,250
Now don't just stand there, leave

189
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:08,750
Until you quit hanging around
with this lousy mechanic...

190
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,707
I won't give you a single penny

191
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,957
Bear that in mind

192
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,458
Come on

193
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,542
Ajayour oil business is over, what next?

194
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:26,250
Raja, that's true but now we
have to go out of our way

195
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,082
I do Know that you are Mr. Ranjit's son

196
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:35,542
But your Dad has forbidden
us to encash your cheque

197
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,249
We cannot disobey him

198
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,749
He is our biggest client

199
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,583
Our bank simply can't afford to lose his account

200
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,166
Why don't you understand?

201
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,875
You will have to clear my cheque

202
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:55,124
I won't, I won't

203
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,583
You tore my cheque!

204
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:03,750
Yes

205
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,915
Hello Dad, It's Ajay here

206
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,665
Yes, my child

207
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,957
This is too much, Dad

208
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,583
This third class manager here had
the nerve to tear off my cheque

209
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:17,582
Did he now? I'm on my way

210
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,542
You come soon, Dad

211
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,999
Good morning, Sir Shut up

212
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,583
Manager, how dare you tear his cheque

213
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,374
And who might you be?

214
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,291
Who am I!

215
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:50,750
It's because of me that you earn your living

216
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,917
And you're enjoying white color status

217
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,540
I am your boss, Ranjit

218
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,625
You are Mr. Ranjit!

219
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,291
I'm sorry, sir. How stupid of me!

220
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:07,708
I am newly transferred here
so didn't recognize you

221
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,041
Don't get cross, sir. Please!

222
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:16,791
But over the phone you told us
to freeze your son's account

223
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,249
I called you?

224
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,458
Yes, you did

225
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,875
Would I call to close my only son's account?

226
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:30,459
My son! One who was born after a hell of efforts

227
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,916
I searched whole India

228
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:38,416
Even went to movie stars

229
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,249
And besides...

230
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,334
I had to stay away from
his mother for ten years

231
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:49,249
And then he was born

232
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,209
He was born after you stay ed
away ten years from your wife!

233
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,874
Yes

234
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:59,209
I cannot bear to see tears in his eyes

235
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,874
My child!

236
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,333
Daddy

237
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,124
My son

238
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,124
Please don't cry, sir

239
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,209
Now it's you who will cry

240
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,582
We will see to it that you do

241
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,042
You deserve it! You despicable fellow

242
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,791
Sorry, sir. It was a mistake on my part

243
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,042
You fail to recognize me and call it a "mistake"?

244
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,250
You tore off my cheque! Sorry won't do

245
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,209
You made my son cry! I
won't accept no apology

246
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,958
Why were you born, earthworm?

247
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,916
I made a mistake, forgive me

248
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,916
I beg of you

249
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,374
Please forgive me

250
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,249
What do you say, Ajay?

251
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,832
Let's forgive him, Dad

252
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,791
Okay fatso, go and bring the cash

253
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,916
Yes, sir

254
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:56,375
Fantastic! Operation no. 2

255
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,249
Hello, Ranjit Rai speaking

256
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,249
This is the cashier from Federal Bank

257
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,707
Yes?

258
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:08,000
The new manager has given your
son half a million rupees in cash

259
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,291
What? Half a million!

260
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:13,875
I will teach that manager a good lesson

261
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,916
Bloody idiot!

262
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,791
Father is on the way

263
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,457
Already here, sir

264
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,999
Hand it over to him

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,374
Here you are, sir. Half a million

266
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,540
Son, tell me one thing

267
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,500
Who could have impersonated
me and called the manager?

268
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,374
Must be Uncle

269
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,582
What?

270
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:37,541
My younger brother whom I disinherited!

271
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,958
That rascal blacky fellow

272
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,874
Manager, If he comes here again...

273
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,582
I understand, sir

274
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,875
I Know how to handle him

275
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,625
He may come here in one piece,

276
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,541
but I will cut him into pieces

277
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,500
Otherwise I am not a neighbors offspring

278
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,249
What?!

279
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,041
Yes

280
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,499
Son, I think it's time to make a move

281
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,749
Come on, hurry up

282
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,999
At least we got the money

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,124
Daddy! Oh dear

284
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,124
Good morning, sir Shut up

285
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,916
Here, wear my wig. Hurry up

286
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:25,208
He is in the cabin, sir

287
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,249
What a freak!

288
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,416
Get lost, stupid morons!

289
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:49,749
Eh, manager

290
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,749
How dare you defy my order
and give my son the money?

291
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,499
I'll close down your bank

292
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,832
My name arent Ranjit Rai for nothing

293
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,042
So you are here

294
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,209
You dog, Rascal, bloody blacky fellow

295
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:16,750
Take him inside and give him a good thrashing

296
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:17,832
No!

297
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,958
Take him away

298
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:24,083
Where are you taking me?

299
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:27,541
Give him a good thrashing

300
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,082
Rascals!

301
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,165
Today I'll get you

302
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:56,500
I will break your bones

303
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:05,250
You went to the bank and posed as me

304
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,833
And look what they have done to me!

305
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,249
Daddy!

306
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,040
Snake! Help me

307
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:16,582
Get it away

308
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,124
Raja, come on

309
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:23,792
Harbu, catch him

310
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,416
Just let me get my hands on you

311
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,874
Who could it have been!

312
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,249
Bloody scoundrel

313
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,749
Are you alright?

314
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,332
Not really

315
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,541
Why don't you ask your son
not to hang around with Raja?

316
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,999
I have left no stone unturned,

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,082
...yet I fail every time

318
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:50,458
How do you plan to get his signature
on the marriage certificate?

319
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,708
I am more clever than him
I am not his father for nothing

320
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:57,915
Just wait and watch, I've my own plan

321
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,291
First page is the property document

322
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:02,999
Second page is ditto

323
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,958
And the third page is marriage certificate

324
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:10,957
Now see how it works!

325
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,416
Hey, what are you... you almost scared me!

326
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,915
You got scared as if you
were caught red-handed!

327
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,791
I am born rich. Why would I steal?

328
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:21,833
Money arent the problem for me

329
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,165
Anyway, sign these documents

330
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:24,833
What are these?

331
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,791
I've bought land on your name. Sign it

332
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,915
Daddy, you're great. Hand me the pen

333
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,874
Stop!

334
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,457
He will not sign

335
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,499
Why not? I am his father

336
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,874
So what?

337
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,082
You remember my sister's last words?

338
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,332
What?

339
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,874
Don't sign any paper without first reading it

340
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:44,915
First read and then sign

341
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:50,541
You are right, Uncle

342
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,500
Read the second page

343
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,791
Ajay

344
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,416
We are getting late. Hurry up!

345
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,416
Just a minute

346
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,957
Tell me where to sign

347
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:07,957
Here

348
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,249
Don't sign without reading

349
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,249
Daddy must have prepared
the right agreement for me

350
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,832
Okay I will read it

351
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,416
Stop it, Uncle

352
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:19,166
You are always fighting like children

353
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:24,124
Here... I've signed it

354
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,166
I don't like this

355
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:30,332
But I like this

356
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,625
See what I mean! I did take his signature

357
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,999
What are you thinking about?

358
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,041
What if I got my daughter's
signature on this certificate?

359
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,624
Say it again, say it again

360
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:51,083
How about I get Madhu's
signature on the same paper

361
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,416
Your head looks like a barren land

362
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,541
But you are a genius within

363
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,749
We will become relatives

364
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,874
Come on give me a hug

365
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:06,083
But how will you get her signature?

366
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:10,417
My daughter is very naive

367
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,041
Snail's pace even in this jet age

368
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:20,583
Snail's pace

369
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,374
You scared me

370
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,832
I would never do that

371
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,416
A very happy birthday to my best friend

372
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,124
Thank you

373
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,874
Kajal, your gift

374
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,749
Thank you

375
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,082
Now tell me, why did you call me here?

376
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,416
Wanted to do some shopping

377
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,624
For yourself or for me?

378
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,583
It doesn't matter, dear

379
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:51,082
Hey, it almost escaped my
mind, I've to ex change a shirt

380
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:57,042
I won't be long. Just a minute

381
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,541
Who did it?

382
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,416
I will show you

383
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:35,416
Are you blind? Come out

384
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,749
I say, come out

385
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,874
I am sorry

386
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,958
You broke my headlight and
this poor fellow's eggs too

387
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,249
Who'll pay the damages, your father?

388
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,541
Leave it, Madhu. He looks a gentleman

389
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:50,125
Gentleman! He looks more like a loafer

390
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,124
Hey, bandit queen Yes?

391
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:55,124
Shut up! Don't talk too much

392
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,583
Ajay, hand me some money

393
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,749
Hey, hen stealer, how much for the eggs?

394
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,749
Only five hundred rupees

395
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,874
Here you go. What about your eggs?

396
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:03,749
What?

397
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,249
I mean your headlight

398
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,249
Five hundred

399
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,541
Five hundred?

400
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,124
Take this, a full thousand

401
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,790
What's the extra five hundred for?

402
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:14,874
You'll soon Know

403
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:19,374
For this. Come on, Ajay

404
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,082
Hang on a sec. Yes?

405
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,749
Here is a full five grand

406
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,707
For what?

407
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:30,667
I'll tell you

408
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,458
For this

409
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,082
But it's only worth four thousand

410
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:41,875
Keep the rest as a tip
Followed, Mr. Stupid?

411
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,792
Come on, Kajal

412
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,041
Damn you!

413
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,333
Forget it, man. I mean, it's just a girl

414
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:54,416
So what? She gives tip and calls me names

415
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,624
Do I look stupid?

416
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:59,625
These toys here are for sale not
for playing around with them

417
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:03,291
Sorry, sir

418
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:09,167
This arent the way to clean
such an expensive statue

419
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,333
Do you Know who is coming to see it?

420
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,249
No, who?

421
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,374
The rich and famous His Excellency
Changeji of Agra

422
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,916
C'mon get going

423
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:21,082
Sorry, darling. I'll clean you

424
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:21,832
Excuse me?

425
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,249
The statue spoke?!

426
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,957
Excuse me. I'm over here

427
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,916
Yes, Ms. Statue, I mean Madam

428
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,958
This shirt is defective

429
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,249
It's impossible

430
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,416
What impossible?

431
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,790
Look here. There is a hole in it

432
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:36,832
Did you see? No

433
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:39,082
No? No

434
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,416
Okay, I'll show you

435
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,999
Can you see it now?

436
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,916
Yes, yes

437
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,082
Suleman

438
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,082
Show the madam another shirt

439
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,416
Otherwise she'll tear my pants too

440
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:55,708
Please proceed to the counter,
he'll show you the shirt

441
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,999
Come on, now cheer up

442
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,208
I Kept quiet because of you

443
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,249
I would have taught her a good lesson

444
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,166
Okay, man, now forget it

445
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,582
She had the nerve to call me stupid!

446
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,124
Why don't you buy a shirt for yourself,

447
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,665
I'll go and check out a chick for me,

448
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:15,249
...I mean, the shoes

449
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,792
The shirt, not the trousers

450
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,459
Welcome your Excellency

451
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,249
Have a good look at the statue

452
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,790
Don't stand in front of it

453
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:02,416
Get aside. Move

454
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,541
Specially carved for you

455
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah, sure

456
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,457
Your Excellency, I...

457
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:25,958
Shut up

458
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,334
Marvelous! Fantastic!

459
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,749
What a craftsmanship!

460
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,209
This craftsman changed the course of nature!

461
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:41,209
We ought to pay him five million

462
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,208
5 million?!

463
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,665
Who made this statue?

464
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,957
Who made it?

465
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,916
I made it with my own hands

466
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:53,041
You are truly great

467
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:56,249
You have no idea what you've done

468
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,249
If you say I'll make half a dozen more

469
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,083
This is what I don't wish

470
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:05,708
The great emperor cut the hands of
workers who worked on Taj Mahal

471
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,499
So that there would be no second one like it

472
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I intend to do the same with you

473
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:14,041
Cut my hands off!

474
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,415
Aladdin?

475
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,291
Yes, my master

476
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:17,582
I am leaving

477
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:21,500
You bring his both hands to Agra

478
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,375
Help me, someone help me

479
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,874
Open the door

480
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:52,083
What shall I do now? Save me, God

481
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,124
After all what's a mobile phone for?

482
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,582
I'll use it. One zero zero

483
00:35:56,583 --> 00:36:00,916

You see, actually I...

502
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,624

504
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:40,916

517
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:19,583

Do you think my head is a match box?

525
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,415
Daddy

526
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,832
Daddy, you're here

00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,083
Don't you call me "uncle"

530
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:59,083
I am only Mr. Harbans for you

531
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:04,292
Do you understand?

532
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:12,584
Bloody crows!

533
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:33,208
See what I mean! Even the crows
didn't approve of your attitude

534
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,290
By the way, why are you here?

535
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,541
I need your signature on these papers

536
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,582
I have to send them over to America today itself

537
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:44,208
I will, but before that I need your signature

538
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,999

In which you state that this
land belongs to these dwellers

542
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:58,249
What? Are you out of your mind?

543
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,416
I am not giving no land to these paupers

544
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,332
No! Never

545
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:08,208
You think I'm going to sign
your rotten documents?

546
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:13,290

00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,457

But you never amend your ways

552
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:29,666

Don't be so childish

555
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:38,125
Tell me where to sign. Doesn't
matter even if it's a death warrant

556
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,457
Over here

557
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:44,749
Bring the pen, hurry up

558
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,374
Daddy, you're so sweet

559
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,749
You are wonderful

560
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,707
You're the best daddy in the whole world

561
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,624
Thank you

562
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:57,124
Come on, Kajal
Let's give them the good news

563
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,416
You are marvelous

564
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:03,333
You bargained utmost
happiness for worthless land

565
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:09,083
Now we'll have our children
eating out of our hands

566
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:23,542
Hey, King of sadness

567
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,666
Don't be like a Romeo

568
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:30,541
Come back to earth! Wake up

569
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:33,207
Since three days you've been like this

570
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:37,290
Forget that girl

571
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:43,417
No, I can't live without her

572
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:48,958
Don't be emotional. Come on, help me

573
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:52,417
Never forget the three
advices of that famous poet

574
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,874
Never run after three things in life

575
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:57,833
A train, a bus and a girl

576
00:41:57,834 --> 00:42:01,208
The world is just plentiful of them, understand?

577
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,291
It's just too many of them around

578
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:14,749
Why have you Kids brought me over here?

579
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,040
Isn't this birthday decoration nice!

580
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,708
Happy birthday!

581
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:23,999
Hey, help me here

582
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,875
Where are you off to?

583
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:47,583
Where are you going?

584
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:06,458
Hey where are you!

585
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:15,416
Do you Know which pipe is to be cut?

586
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:19,208
Bloody deaf! You've to cut a pipe

587
00:43:19,584 --> 00:43:21,583
Pipe! Yeah, yes

588
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:25,958
Go and finish your job

589
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:32,249
What an idiot!

590
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,708
Oh, dear!

591
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:40,542
Hey idiot are you taking a stroll there?

592
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:45,000
Bloody fool! I am talking to you

593
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,416
Are you deaf?

594
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:53,541
What's the problem? Get aside

595
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,916
You moron, look below

596
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:02,708
You darned fellow!

597
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,999
Oh, my God!

598
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,749
Help!

599
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:31,292
He will surely die

600
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,082
Somebody save him

601
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,040
Somebody help him

602
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,249
Raja!

603
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,666
Why is he crying? What's the matter?

604
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:49,167
Raja!

605
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:52,291
Hey you! Why on the earth
are you hanging there?

606
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,749
Somebody help him please

607
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,749
I told you never to run after three things

608
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,291
Bus, train and girls

609
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,166
See what I mean. Just look at yourself!

610
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,249
Will you stop lecturing! Help me

611
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,500
I'm coming. It's just trouble that he's inviting

612
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:08,832
Hurry up!

613
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:12,416
What should I do?

614
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:16,250
Oh, God! Oh, God please look after us

615
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:24,000
Oh, God! Oh, God

616
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,749
I'm gone

617
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,874
I'm gone

618
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,666
Help me

619
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,624
I'll fall

620
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:44,082
What are you doing, hurry up!

621
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,583
Shut up

622
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:51,000
Why did I've to invite him today

623
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:58,541
Oh, God

624
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:12,458
I am gone I am gone!

625
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:18,332
Hurry up! I can't hang on any longer

626
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:21,500
I am not no stuntman

627
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:23,458
Hold on or lose the grip

628
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,874
Okay, man, I'll just hold on

629
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:30,125
I must close my eyes and go ahead

630
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:35,750
Oh dear!

631
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:56,500
He will save him. He is a real hero

632
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,874
You are too slow

633
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:08,249
Just Keep quiet, man

634
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,124
Oh, God

635
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,416
What are you doing?

636
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:20,042
Oh, I am dead!

637
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:22,541
Ajay, please save me

638
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:24,999
It was you who came to save me

639
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,167
What are you doing?

640
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:30,249
Hold me please

641
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,875
I don't want to die I mean,
I am not even married yet

642
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:37,207
Me too, man

643
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,749
Both will die. Oh, God save them

644
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:46,084
Do you hear what I hear?

645
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:49,416
I can even see it

646
00:47:49,417 --> 00:47:52,832
Look over there

647
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:59,750
Can't you see we are hanging down the pipe?

648
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:05,875
You idiot, you can't hear but you can see us

649
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:11,082
Somebody help

650
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:16,042
Stupid, I told you to cut the
lower pipe not the upper one

651
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,665
Now both of them will die

652
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:21,832
Stop it. What's he doing!

653
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:24,707
Somebody stop him

654
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:27,374
I'll be blamed for their death!

655
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:32,249
Don't do it. Stop it

656
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:38,042
Stop cutting, you idiot!

657
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,708
Good morning, Auntie

658
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,665
What happened?

659
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:29,957
Help me

660
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,374
Auntie, listen to us please

661
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,749
We weren't trying to rape you

662
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,082
Really we're doing no such thing

663
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,708
Ajay, gag her otherwise
we'll be convicted of rape

664
00:49:41,917 --> 00:49:47,333
Shut up, fatso

665
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,374
Come dear, come

666
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,582
No, auntie

667
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,916
Now it's your turn

668
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:03,916
Don't touch me

669
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,832
I will fix you

670
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,249
No! No!

671
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,540
You wanted to rape me

672
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,540
Open the door

673
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:13,999
Stay back

674
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,209
I think I'd have to break the door

675
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:19,665
Help me No, auntie, don't touch me

676
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:22,416
Oh God, give me strength

677
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,749
Help me

678
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,249
I am coming, dear

679
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:31,499
I'm falling, dear

680
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,624
What are you looking at? Come on, run!

681
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:38,542
Hurry up, run

682
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,499
Are you hurt?

683
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,582
Very badly, deep down inside, from head to toe

684
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,291
He loves you madly

685
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:57,334
Whenever he sees you his heartbeat
goes up, blood pressure goes down

686
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:59,916
He gets crazy
He doesn't Know what he is doing

687
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:02,082
He breaks statues, walks on pipes,

688
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:04,041
Even puts me in trouble

689
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:06,582
By the way, what are your
plans for tomorrow evening?

690
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:10,499
Can you meet him at 5,
in the Hanging Gardens?

691
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,540
Let me express my love myself

692
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:17,291
I am just helping you out
I don't need it, now leave

693
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:20,249
So, now the girl is more important than a friend

694
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:26,333
But don't forget... Girl, bus and train

695
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:29,582
You see... I'm sorry

696
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:32,708
My friend was just blurting nonsense

697
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:12,208
I don't understand where are you two going?

698
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:15,875
I am taking her to the hill station

699
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:19,208
What made you decide so suddenly?

700
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:22,792
Because my Dad is making
plans for my marriage

701
00:57:22,959 --> 00:57:25,749
And I am not in no mood for it

702
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,457
Uncle, if we Keep talking
here we may miss our flight

703
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:31,207
Hurry up, Kajal, don't waste time in packing

704
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,249
Be quick, it's almost the departure time

705
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,207
By e, Uncle. See you, by e

706
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:38,666
Take care, Kajal

707
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:41,959
Madhu has just gone to a nearby
Hill-station, not to some Honolulu

708
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,291
Quit worrying I'll send Ajay there as well

709
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,082
Let me get this straight...

710
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,749
you fix ed my wedding without
even asking me about it!

711
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,249
I am not going anywhere to see no girl

712
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,624
impossible! I will not marry her

713
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:56,708
You will have to

714
00:57:56,709 --> 00:58:00,958
Never ever

715
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:03,666
How dare you disobey your father?

716
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:07,792
He was the one to change your
nappies when you were a baby

717
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,207
He became a donkey... What?

718
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:13,291
I mean he even became
a horse for you to ride on

719
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:19,666
Such a great father deserves worship

720
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,874
You don't Know my father

721
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:23,791
I Know him very well

722
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,666
Your father may be mean... Hey!

723
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:28,666
...but he can never be selfish
Exactly

724
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,374
You ought to obey your father
And get yourself ready to leave

725
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,999
Try to understand... Quiet!

726
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,499
Please arrange for one extra ticket
Why?

727
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,040
Because I'll go with him too
Why is that?

728
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:40,207
To make sure he does go there,
and doesn't return from the airport

729
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:42,874
Correct. I will call the travel agent

730
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:46,041
I'll never go, Daddy

731
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:56,083
You very well Know that I love Kajal

732
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,999
Hang on, I came to save you
and it's me you're hitting!

733
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,541
To save me! Hear me out first

734
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:03,667
Your father is planning to
marry you to that haughty girl,

735
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,457
the one we met in shopping arcade
Why would I be interested in her!

736
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,582
Your Kajal happens to be with her

737
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:09,749
Really? That's right

738
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,582
You romance Kajal...

739
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:17,875
and I'll fix that other hot-head

740
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,791
I am fed up of my Dad

741
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:26,958
He is forcing me to meet that guy

742
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:29,791
Meet him at least. What's there to lose?

743
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:31,874
But how will you recognize him?

744
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:35,500
He will be holding a red rose

745
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,999
What?

746
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,291
Daddy chose this ape for me!

747
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:47,500
Hurry up, man. That baldy's
daughter must be waiting for us

748
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:51,666
And his loafer friend is also with him?

749
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:54,749
This is too much. That dame
isn't anywhere to be seen...

750
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,583
who was supposed to receive us?

751
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:59,041
That bald head said she would
recognize us by this rose

752
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,791
Excuse me Yes

753
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:04,750
Actually I am that girl, the one
you are supposed to meet

754
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:08,082
Oh, so you are! What a darling...

755
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:10,124
...a real sweetheart

756
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,833
Your heart is so full of love

757
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:17,125
Come and give me a hug

758
01:00:19,709 --> 01:00:21,541
Ajay, what's all this?

759
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:24,583
Keep quiet, I'll tell you later

760
01:00:24,584 --> 01:00:27,666
Leave me alone I am hugging my fiancée

761
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,708
It's nobody's business,

762
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,749
come and give me a hug, my love

763
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,583
Let go of me

764
01:00:34,584 --> 01:00:40,375
Oh, it feels so good to hug you

765
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,082
What's the matter?

766
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:45,082
I think there is something in my pants

767
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,749
Is it? We'll go home and check it out

768
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,291
Shall we make a move? Yes

769
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:53,207
Come on, Ajay

770
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:54,957
Welcome gentlemen

771
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:58,165
Bahadur, send them up

772
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:01,208
I mean to the bungalow up the hill

773
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:04,916
You go ahead, we'll follow in the other car

774
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,915
Shall I accompany them?

775
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:09,749
Shut up. You'll come with me

776
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,040
Bahadur? Yes?

777
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,166
How long will it take to reach the place?

778
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:18,666
About 3 to 4 hours

779
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,082
There's a monkey inside!

780
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,249
007 BOND

781
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,583
Calls himself James bloody Bond!

782
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:26,915
My wife treats him like a brother

783
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:31,000
He's supposed to watch over me

784
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:34,040
Hey, you get in front

785
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:39,042
Get in, sir

786
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:45,792
Go, man. This would be the
last journey of your life!

787
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:52,874
Stop at the flower shop please

788
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,040
I need to get some flowers for my girl friend

789
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,874
I can't stop Why?

790
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,458
Because the brakes aren't working

791
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:01,499
Oh I see! No brakes

792
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,874
What? No brakes!

793
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,166
How will we get down?

794
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:10,625
Let me show you... like this

795
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:13,624
Hey mister, where are you going?

796
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,416
Please come back

797
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:20,416
Ta, ta, sir

798
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,625
Oh no!

799
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:42,166
You are great, you saved our lives

800
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:48,333
You are not a monkey, you're an angel

801
01:02:53,791 --> 01:03:00,291
Hey guy, where are you off to!

802
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:05,040
What a strange creature!

803
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:10,291
Ajay! Watch out

804
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:22,500
Hey man, how the hell did
you drive on two wheels?

805
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,915
Ajay, look ahead!

806
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:31,000
Honey! Why is the engine misfiring?

807
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:35,000
Wake up, something hit us!

808
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:37,749
Look who is at the back!

809
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,082
Get out of the way

810
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,832
Oh, my God!

811
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,915
They are the same guys...

812
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:47,208
who came to rape me in
the bathroom the other day

813
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:48,999
Move out

814
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,665
Don't you worry, love

815
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:53,833
They will have to rape me first

816
01:03:56,125 --> 01:04:00,792
Shit!

817
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,790
Ta, ta. Ta, ta.

818
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,707
You bloody mosquito!

819
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:38,084
Just let me get my hands on you

820
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,458
Madam

821
01:05:03,459 --> 01:05:05,583
Madam!

822
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:07,999
What's the problem, Bahadur?

823
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,790
Those two guys...

824
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:12,374
They were Killed in a car crash

825
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,874
What!

826
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:18,207
They are dead!

827
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:20,582
Okay, you go in your cottage

828
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,374
No, please no, let me sleep here

829
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:24,416
Why?

830
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:29,625
You see, people who die
this way turn into ghosts

831
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:33,083
Their spirits wander everywhere

832
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,417
I am very scared

833
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,374
Please let me sleep here today

834
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:42,041
Okay, sleep on the sofa

835
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,957
Thank you, madam

836
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:49,500
Oh my God!

837
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:09,582
Bahadur?

838
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:14,875
Bahadur!

839
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:52,459
Madam, look...

840
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:59,042
Oh, no! Bahadur!

841
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,916
Kajal

842
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:20,208
No!

843
01:07:20,209 --> 01:07:25,792
Open the door

844
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:43,624
Who is it?

845
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:48,709
Who is there?

846
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:01,458
Recognize me?

847
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,957
I'm your death

848
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,000
I have Killed him already

849
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:16,041
Now it's your turn

850
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:24,916
Come!

851
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:19,707
Bahadur, you too!

852
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:24,125
You gave me one thousand
rupees to fail the brakes

853
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:29,541
And he gave me two thousand to put on this act

854
01:09:45,209 --> 01:09:47,457
Who do you think you are, huh?

855
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,540
Take yourself to be a great clown?

856
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,749
This wasn't at all funny!

857
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:57,084
I will break your face if you
go about your pranks again

858
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:03,083
Madhu!

859
01:10:03,084 --> 01:10:04,208
Madhu...

860
01:10:04,209 --> 01:10:06,916
Why did you slap him?

861
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:09,083
Didn't you see what he did to me?

862
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:11,457
And how about what you did to them

863
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,749
You had their car brakes failed...

864
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,999
They could have been easily Killed,

865
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,290
hadn't they jumped out at the right time

866
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:26,250
Don't joke with others if you
can't take it yourself

867
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,041
Don't try to stop me. Let me go, please

868
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:38,582
Don't get cross, listen to me

869
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:42,458
Ajay, please... leave me alone
Don't stop me

870
01:10:49,084 --> 01:10:54,457
Sorry

871
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,000
Didn't you hear? I already apologized

872
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:05,874
Let go of my bag

873
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:09,000
I won't till you forgive me

874
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:11,832
I said, leave my bag

875
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:14,959
You are lucky, man
Your wife is apologizing...

876
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:17,457
In over forty years of my marriage...

877
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:20,457
it's always been me who ends up apologizing

878
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,749
Shut up, old man

879
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:30,125
I said leave my bag

880
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,374
Will you or won't you leave it?

881
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,791
No

882
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:39,083
I say, let it go

883
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:45,208
See what I mean!
You should have pardoned me

884
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:10,167
Damn you!

885
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:09,500
What Kind of wine was it
which you made me drink,

886
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:13,333
...that upset my entire system!

887
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:23,542
Thank you, guys, many thanks

888
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:40,249
Hey, aren't you saying it

889
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,249
What?

890
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,583
That you've a crush on me, you love me too

891
01:13:47,042 --> 01:13:48,874
I feel embarrassed

892
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:53,541
If you won't I'd be in despair

893
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:56,457
I Love You

894
01:13:56,458 --> 01:14:01,125
Yes!

895
01:17:57,875 --> 01:18:01,249
Share mark... oh, here...

896
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,750
Don't read newspaper, you
can watch all this stuff on TV

897
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:07,791
You're wasting your time

898
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:09,207
You hit me!

899
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:12,709
One bloody mosquito can
make a person gutless

900
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:16,500
It can very well make one lose nerve

901
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:20,082
Anyway, just a mosquito it was!

902
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:23,249
But one fax will make you go insane

903
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:26,957
Ajay is coming tomorrow

904
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:29,166
Who will make all the arrangements?

905
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:33,208
Don't worry, leave all that to me

906
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:48,041
So, how did you like all this?

907
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:52,584
The music will go on until it
becomes a pain in y or ass

908
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,791
What...! Come on, come on move

909
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,708
And these girls here... Wow!

910
01:18:59,709 --> 01:19:04,667
...will freak you out with flowers

911
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:05,749
Shut up!

912
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:08,374
Look, Ajay is here

913
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:10,374
Girls, don't just stand there!

914
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:14,040
Go and give them a grand welcome

915
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:18,458
Come on, darling

916
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:19,999
Who is that girl?

917
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,541
Thank you

918
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:26,292
She is a friend of my daughter
She lives in a filthy slum

919
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:29,166
What? It's true

920
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:32,207
Cheer up, dear brother-in-law

921
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:35,417
Photographer, take his picture with them
Hurry up

922
01:19:35,584 --> 01:19:39,332
Hey, what are you doing, don't...

923
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:42,542
And what might you be staring at, sir?

924
01:19:45,292 --> 01:19:47,249
Thanks for the welcome, Dad

925
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,374
I have yet to give you a
true welcome at home, later

926
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:50,957
Please look here, smile please

927
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:55,708
Smile Dad

928
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,666
By e Dad, See you

929
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:02,167
He has totally disgraced you

930
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:06,708
Turn back, you too are about
to greet your worst nightmare!

931
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,915
Hi Dad

932
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:11,915
What!

933
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:15,707
Oh, thank you

934
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:20,416
Wow!

935
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:23,041
Don't stand here like a mad bull

936
01:20:23,042 --> 01:20:26,292
Go ahead and have one photo
with your daughter and son-in-law

937
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:28,665
Shut the fuck up! Take him away

938
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:29,749
Bald head

939
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,874
He's got an attitude problem, man!

940
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:36,207
Hey, leave me alone, don't...

941
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:40,042
Oh, Dad, I never dreamed you
would welcome us like this

942
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:41,207
Yes, yes

943
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:43,082
I will show you later

944
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:47,042
You brat, we sent you there to
bring Ajay and Madhu close,

945
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,291
...and you had the nerve to
start an affair with her yourself!

946
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:52,665
Dear father-in-law, it was natural,

947
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:56,083
You sent the cat to guard the
milk, it's certain to lick it all up

948
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:59,707
Bastard, I'll Kill you

949
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:01,374
Daddy, daddy

950
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:03,541
We can settle all this at home

951
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:07,750
Otherwise the whole town will Know
about this story in tomorrow's papers

952
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:13,207
Smile please, Daddy, smile

953
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:15,541
Let's go, darling

954
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:20,750
Bye Ta ta.

955
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:25,208
Did you see how our children insulted us

956
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:27,291
Take out that marriage certificate,

957
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:30,207
and we'll show them what we're capable of!

958
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:33,541
Relax, Harbu. Calm yourself

959
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:37,584
When there are many ways
to solve the problem...

960
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:41,707
why go for the ultimate option

961
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:45,500
Leave it to me and watch what I do!

962
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:56,875
Welcome father-in-law, my respects

963
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:08,665
Bastard

964
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:12,167
Don't worry, sir, it will be done

965
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:16,666
Raja, we don't need your services anymore

966
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:21,916
Come with me, I'll settle your account

967
01:22:21,917 --> 01:22:22,916
Why?

968
01:22:22,917 --> 01:22:26,583
Because he is the new owner of this garage

969
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:43,416
You had me fired, it is alright

970
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:46,790
But how will you KicK me out
from your daughter's heart?

971
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:51,792
You bloody...

972
01:22:57,541 --> 01:23:00,625
That just goes to show how
a lower-class mind works

973
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:08,500
You moron, we fired you so
that you could own this garage

974
01:23:09,334 --> 01:23:11,874
Just sign this contract...

975
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:16,625
and you'll be the new owner
of this 25 million worth garage

976
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,499
But remember one thing,

977
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,790
Your sign on this will be the guarantee that,

978
01:23:20,791 --> 01:23:25,000
you'll be out of Madhu's life forever

979
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:29,458
Here... sign it

980
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:33,540
Go ahead, do it

981
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,166
What are you doing? Come here,

982
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:41,875
Money is our ultimate goal, that's
why we play ed this game of love,

983
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:44,874
now when you're getting
it, why change your mind!

984
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:47,916
I suggest you sign it

985
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:51,041
Okay, I'll sign it

986
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:51,957
Where is the pen?

987
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:56,959
Sir, hand me the pen please

988
01:23:58,708 --> 01:23:59,957
Would that be all, sir?

989
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:00,999
Yes, yes.

990
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,292
Hey, girlie, now tell me what would
be your price to leave my son alone?

991
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:06,916
A cup of tea

992
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,249
A cup of tea?!

993
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,583
Yes, you'll have to drink
one cup of tea made by me

994
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:16,209
Huh! I take nothing touched by the poor

995
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:20,875
We are not poor now, we own this garage

996
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:24,583
You can certainly have a cup of tea

997
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:28,166
Well said, the boy has a point there

998
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:29,832
Okay bring it. We'll drink

999
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:33,209
Come on, Kajal. Let's make tea for them

1000
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:34,583
Here, gentlemen, please do have some tea

1001
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:37,874
What are you doing?

1002
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:40,333
This tea is worth 25 million rupees

1003
01:25:40,334 --> 01:25:44,458
Let me see what the expensive tea tastes like

1004
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:50,875
Hey, it just turned out to be ordinary tea

1005
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:56,541
If 25 million couldn't change the taste of tea,

1006
01:25:56,708 --> 01:26:00,000
How would it change our minds?

1007
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,958
You truly have no self respect
to be still standing here!

1008
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,582
No respectful person can stand such an insult!

1009
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:10,707
Someone else in your place
would have died of shame

1010
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:13,582
itll be you both who is going to die...

1011
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:16,332
and that too a dog's death

1012
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:18,208
Come on, fellows

1013
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:24,458
Break their bones

1014
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,540
Ajay!

1015
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:40,166
Kajal, this is not a flower,

1016
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:42,332
it's symbolizes my true feelings for you

1017
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:45,708
Daddy, she's not an enemy but
a future daughter-in-law for you

1018
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:48,290
This is impossible, it won't ever happen

1019
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:54,209
impossible! Tomorrow we're going
to register our marriage in court

1020
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:03,666
Look at these papers

1021
01:27:03,667 --> 01:27:06,457
These are not property documents

1022
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,707
It's your death warrant

1023
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:10,999
It's a marriage certificate from the court...

1024
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,125
duly signed by you and Madhu

1025
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:18,832
Take a good look

1026
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:23,750
According to it you and her are legally married

1027
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:29,792
You both can't marry any one
else not any one in the universe!

1028
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:34,000
This certificate is a grave of your dreams

1029
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:37,541
Your love, your hopes will be buried in it

1030
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:41,833
It's the ashes of your dreams
that you'll be left with now

1031
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:51,125
Hey, what have you done, this isn't happening!

1032
01:28:01,084 --> 01:28:03,374
What you were counting on is already ashes!

1033
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:08,792
Throw them in the sacred rivers if you wish

1034
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,958
Why the rivers...

1035
01:28:15,959 --> 01:28:19,542
you have challenged an enormous sea

1036
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:23,167
And now its fierce storm
will engulf your love...

1037
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:26,625
the one that you're so proud of

1038
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:33,208
Your love will be ruined

1039
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:37,207
It's neither afraid of sea nor fire

1040
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:40,250
Never beaten by arrows or Knives

1041
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:43,875
Love is extreme, love is doomsday

1042
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:48,125
Whoever challenged it, has been destroy ed!

1043
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:04,583
Hey, c'mon bring it fast
Coming, guys

1044
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:09,207
Oh, hello, Mr. Gaitonde, what a
surprise to see you in this shady joint!

1045
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:12,207
Are times so bad that you have to
make do with unbranded liquor?

1046
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:14,165
Today I can at least drink this...

1047
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:16,582
but tomorrow I will not be able
to drink even country liquor

1048
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:20,542
A couple of swines have
brought me to this state

1049
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:22,707
They got me chucked out of the bank

1050
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:26,250
Now I have only... one ambition in my life,

1051
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:30,250
to finish those two and be hanged myself

1052
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:34,042
And I don't care if it takes
my last penny to do this

1053
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,874
You do have enough to pay your bill I suppose?

1054
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:39,207
I have a thousand rupees with me

1055
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,999
Do you want to turn that
thousand into two thousand?

1056
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,833
What do you say! How?

1057
01:29:43,834 --> 01:29:49,583
It is very simple. I can prove you
have eleven fingers in your hands

1058
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,999
Eleven? What rubbish are you talking...

1059
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,207
It is no rubbish

1060
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:56,041
I Know I have only ten fingers in my hands

1061
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:58,083
I say eleven, want to bet?

1062
01:29:58,084 --> 01:29:59,457
All right, it is a bet

1063
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:00,916
Put down a thousand then

1064
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:02,249
Here is my thousand

1065
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,999
Okay, count

1066
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,042
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... 10

1067
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:14,417
I will count again, you won't be
let off so easily. Just a minute

1068
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:18,375
Ten, nine, eight, seven six...

1069
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:21,834
Friends, now how many is six and five?

1070
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:22,916
Eleven

1071
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:25,582
See what I mean. And there you are!

1072
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:28,041
Hey, I had eleven fingers in
my hands, yet I didn't Know it!

1073
01:30:28,042 --> 01:30:29,290
How is that possible

1074
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:32,249
One, two, three, four... ten

1075
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,124
He made a fool out of me

1076
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:36,707
Hey, wait you rascal

1077
01:30:36,708 --> 01:30:38,374
You won't get away from me

1078
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,749
Made a fool out of me

1079
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:44,250
You dog, you wretch, you
made off with my last thousand!

1080
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:47,917
If I get my hands on you I will Kill you

1081
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:50,791
Twenty-five, twenty-five

1082
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:54,083
Not 25, but it is a full thousand
that he has made off with

1083
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,374
Twenty-five

1084
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:57,541
No, friend, not 25 but one thousand

1085
01:30:57,542 --> 01:30:58,541
Twenty-five

1086
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:01,582
Hey, after 25 there is 26 and then 27...

1087
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:02,874
Twenty-five

1088
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:06,375
Why do you Keep looking into this
hole and Keep repeating twenty-five?

1089
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:08,874
Let me have a look too what's inside!

1090
01:31:08,875 --> 01:31:12,458
Who is it? Hey, who is inside?

1091
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:20,583
Twenty-six, twenty-six

1092
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:27,417
Madhu... Madhu? Where is Madhu?

1093
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,541
Sir, Madam Madhu left
with her bag in the morning

1094
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:31,999
What? She is gone?

1095
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,958
Harbu, my son has not come
home since y yesterday,

1096
01:31:34,959 --> 01:31:37,040
and today your daughter
has left home and gone

1097
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:38,457
Where have these two gone?

1098
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:42,541
How do I... I will tell you

1099
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:45,625
Your daughter has brought
disgrace to you, she has run off

1100
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,708
What!

1101
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:48,708
She has eloped with her lover

1102
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:49,708
No!

1103
01:31:49,709 --> 01:31:52,959
And that is not all. They are getting
married in the Court tomorrow

1104
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:56,040
In celebration of which I have
brought sweets for you, brother

1105
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:57,124
Please have some

1106
01:31:57,125 --> 01:32:00,249
Come on, have some. Do have some sweets

1107
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,374
Brijesh!

1108
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,374
Don't shout

1109
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:06,542
A man whose daughter runs away from home,

1110
01:32:06,709 --> 01:32:09,833
does not have the right raise his voice

1111
01:32:09,834 --> 01:32:13,208
And do you remember what
you had said the other day?

1112
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:18,709
That if your daughter did anything
like this, you would shoot her

1113
01:32:19,292 --> 01:32:21,374
So, here, take this gun

1114
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:26,333
Go and shoot her, go on, what
are you thinking about now?

1115
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:31,541
You cannot shoot

1116
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:33,999
Not only you, no father can do it

1117
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,207
There is nothing you can do

1118
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:40,834
All you can do is watch
helplessly like a gutless fellow

1119
01:32:41,166 --> 01:32:47,500
Like a gutless fellow,

1120
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:53,040
Cannot do anything! Forget it

1121
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:55,165
What are you thinking about, Harbans

1122
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:58,082
This is not the time to think, it is time for action

1123
01:32:58,083 --> 01:33:00,749
There will be shooting and there will be corpses,

1124
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:04,792
but of those bastards who have challenged us

1125
01:33:05,584 --> 01:33:09,834
These bastards have dragged
our family name into mud

1126
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,416
We have to hide our faces in shame

1127
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:16,458
They have turned our own
offspring into our enemy

1128
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,457
Bring them to such a death that,

1129
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:21,500
people would shudder even
at the thought of "Love"

1130
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:53,958
Who stole my sleep, lover?
You did

1131
01:33:57,542 --> 01:34:02,792
Oh, who stole my peace, lover?
You did

1132
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:11,834
Who lives in my heart?

1133
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:17,792
You do, you, it is you

1134
01:38:22,791 --> 01:38:25,665
I won't give up, Kill, Kill, I will Kill

1135
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:27,124
I will Kill, Kill

1136
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,249
Hey you, hey what are you doing Fatso?

1137
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:32,833
Won't spare you, you two have ruined me

1138
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,832
Won't spare you, ladies you please go

1139
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:36,458
This is between men, ladies not allowed

1140
01:38:36,459 --> 01:38:39,958
Hey you Fatso, let them go

1141
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:48,666
You scarecrow, you hired these
cheap goons to thrash us?

1142
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:53,750
Hey you, I don't come cheap I take thousands

1143
01:38:55,042 --> 01:39:01,125
Oh, he is not cheap, he takes thousands!

1144
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:06,167
Shut up, stop mimicking me

1145
01:39:06,334 --> 01:39:08,374
Listen very carefully

1146
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:11,458
I have promised to Kill y
our friend and your chick

1147
01:39:11,459 --> 01:39:16,875
on a payment of 2.5 million
rupees, from your own father

1148
01:39:23,209 --> 01:39:26,832
Hey, don't move

1149
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:29,208
Why are you fellows standing
around doing nothing?

1150
01:39:29,209 --> 01:39:32,750
Break up this Romeo and Juliet twosome

1151
01:39:38,833 --> 01:39:41,082
It is your turn first

1152
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:44,666
Before going to your death, think of your God

1153
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:49,250
No! You will not Kill him, he is my prey

1154
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:56,250
If you have taken money to Kill,
I have taken an oath to do it

1155
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,833
Come, brother, give me the gun

1156
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,041
Come on

1157
01:40:03,042 --> 01:40:05,082
Hey you, give me the gun

1158
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:08,208
No, no Quiet

1159
01:40:08,209 --> 01:40:09,249
Hey, hey, hey

1160
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,291
You guys throw out this sack of flour

1161
01:40:11,292 --> 01:40:14,249
Who are you calling a flour sack, you rascal?

1162
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:16,540
Throw him out Hey, let go of me

1163
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:18,832
Hey, don't give me an unfair deal

1164
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:21,041
This is my prey

1165
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:22,374
You, you, I will...

1166
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:25,540
My name is Damliya, it is Damliya

1167
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:30,500
Every dog in this town Knows me

1168
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:34,167
Yeah, a dog like you would
be Known to all other dogs

1169
01:40:36,042 --> 01:40:39,209
You called me a dog, me!

1170
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:42,208
Bitch

1171
01:40:42,209 --> 01:40:45,583
You bastard, I will...

1172
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:51,249
Hit him, Raja, hit him

1173
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:56,042
Raise your hand to me, will you? Hit me?

1174
01:40:56,541 --> 01:40:58,874
You don't Know who I am

1175
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:01,041
Very hot-blooded, are you?

1176
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:04,249
Speak up, speak up

1177
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:07,124
I will not finish you like this

1178
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:12,042
I will make your body into a sieve with this gun,

1179
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:17,209
then all your hot blood will flow out of the holes

1180
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:21,042
and you will suffer so badly

1181
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:24,583
...like a fish out of water

1182
01:41:25,209 --> 01:41:27,582
Fish out of water!

1183
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:30,708
And when there is still a little life left in you,

1184
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:34,750
I will place you on a funeral pyre

1185
01:41:35,292 --> 01:41:38,166
...and then I will light the pyre

1186
01:41:38,167 --> 01:41:41,624
First your shroud will burn

1187
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:44,958
...and later it will be your skin

1188
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:50,541
and then your conscience will start burning

1189
01:41:50,708 --> 01:41:54,666
You do Know the sensation
of burning, don't you?

1190
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:57,124
Don't you?

1191
01:41:57,125 --> 01:42:01,084
But why am I feeling this burning?!

1192
01:42:02,541 --> 01:42:03,707
Why am I feeling it?

1193
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:07,209
You dumb, look underneath

1194
01:42:13,292 --> 01:42:17,166
No, no!

1195
01:42:17,167 --> 01:42:19,083
Hey, why are you all standing around?

1196
01:42:19,084 --> 01:42:24,834
Come and put out this fire

1197
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:31,792
Wait, wait, wait, I will tell
you how to put out the fire

1198
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:33,083
How?

1199
01:42:33,084 --> 01:42:35,457
Like this

1200
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:39,415
...and like this

1201
01:42:39,416 --> 01:42:41,291
Hey, why are you all standing around

1202
01:42:41,292 --> 01:42:43,332
Come all of you, put the fire out

1203
01:42:43,333 --> 01:42:45,208
Come, put it out

1204
01:42:45,209 --> 01:42:46,624
Come thrash it, harder, harder

1205
01:42:46,625 --> 01:42:51,415
C'mon guys, let's vamoose fast

1206
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:55,000
Hey you, are you saving me or hitting me?

1207
01:43:07,209 --> 01:43:09,624
Where have they gone?

1208
01:43:09,625 --> 01:43:10,916
Oh, they seem to have run away

1209
01:43:10,917 --> 01:43:17,000
Catch those swine, catch them

1210
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,209
The clothes; let's change quickly

1211
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,707
Hey, did you see them going?

1212
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:33,083
No, no one has come this way

1213
01:43:33,084 --> 01:43:35,457
They are bound to be hiding somewhere around

1214
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:41,250
We will wait right here for them

1215
01:43:52,541 --> 01:43:53,832
Hey, how are you today?

1216
01:43:53,833 --> 01:43:56,249
We'd just like to confirm our tickets

1217
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:58,249
Hey, who the hell are you, man

1218
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:04,208
You seem to be creating trouble

1219
01:44:37,541 --> 01:44:38,707
Come on

1220
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:43,833
You go look over there

1221
01:44:49,542 --> 01:44:51,791
Hurry

1222
01:44:51,792 --> 01:44:56,500
Come

1223
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:25,583
Ajay, Ajay, Ajay!

1224
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,500
You bastard

1225
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:49,208
Ajay, Ajay!

1226
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:55,250
Ajay!

1227
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:07,374
Right, turn right

1228
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:12,874
OPERATION THEATRE

1229
01:46:12,875 --> 01:46:14,791
Madhu...

1230
01:46:14,792 --> 01:46:16,999
If anything happens to Ajay...

1231
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,707
No, calm yourself

1232
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:21,999
If anything happens to Ajay...

1233
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,124
Nothing is going to happen to Ajay

1234
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:27,249
Don't worry, he will be all right

1235
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:33,250
Everything will be all right

1236
01:46:35,416 --> 01:46:36,916
Doctor, how is he?

1237
01:46:36,917 --> 01:46:39,624
There is nothing to worry
about, he is out of danger

1238
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:41,791
In a little while we will shift him to the ward

1239
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:44,249
You can see him after that. All right?

1240
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:49,500
Thank you doctor, thank you

1241
01:46:54,542 --> 01:46:59,666
Ajay?

1242
01:47:14,667 --> 01:47:22,125
I didn't wish to live, but your
love did not allow me to die

1243
01:47:22,917 --> 01:47:27,083
Now stop talking, you need rest

1244
01:47:33,041 --> 01:47:36,667
Ajay, don't get up

1245
01:47:37,709 --> 01:47:41,207
Raja, tell him to go away

1246
01:47:41,208 --> 01:47:44,332
Son, I... You have no son here

1247
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:46,624
There is no relationship between us

1248
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:50,041
Son, I have realized my mistake

1249
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:52,999
I have come to beg forgiveness from you all

1250
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,125
You have even lost the
right to ask for forgiveness

1251
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:02,833
You are giving me such a big punishment

1252
01:48:02,834 --> 01:48:08,583
A father will not be forgiven by his son!

1253
01:48:10,041 --> 01:48:13,333
All right, all right

1254
01:48:13,792 --> 01:48:16,082
But that culprit will certainly be punished,

1255
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:18,541
...who has wronged you all

1256
01:48:18,542 --> 01:48:21,917
He will definitely be punished... definitely

1257
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,582
Certainly he'll be punished

1258
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:28,833
I must be given punishment

1259
01:48:28,834 --> 01:48:31,457
I must be punished

1260
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:32,708
I must, I must, I must

1261
01:48:32,709 --> 01:48:36,374
Uncle, what are you doing?

1262
01:48:36,375 --> 01:48:37,374
Leave me

1263
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:39,708
Enough, enough

1264
01:48:39,709 --> 01:48:46,500
Leave me, I am that wretch
who sent goons to Kill you

1265
01:48:56,041 --> 01:49:00,208
Ajay, there is no bigger
punishment than repentance

1266
01:49:00,375 --> 01:49:03,583
Today he has realized his mistake

1267
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:06,624
Forgive him

1268
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:10,166
For the sake of my friendship, you must

1269
01:49:14,208 --> 01:49:19,417
Daddy!

1270
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:23,500
My son, my child!

1271
01:49:35,166 --> 01:49:38,291
Son, I was against your love

1272
01:49:38,292 --> 01:49:41,458
But today I promise...

1273
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:47,375
I'll see that your desire is fulfilled

1274
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:54,125
...and he became crazy!

1275
01:49:55,458 --> 01:50:02,166
Ranjit, Ranjit, I say,
Ranjit, you come out

1276
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,291
What is it, Harbu?

1277
01:50:13,292 --> 01:50:14,999
What is there to talk about now?

1278
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,166
How well you have served our friendship

1279
01:50:18,417 --> 01:50:20,207
You sheltered my enemy in your home

1280
01:50:20,208 --> 01:50:23,584
And then you print and distribute
these engagement cards, you!

1281
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:26,833
How well you have stood by me, Ranjit!

1282
01:50:26,834 --> 01:50:30,958
Harbu, I have done everything
after a great deal of thinking

1283
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:34,166
The sight of your son's blood
must have made you soft

1284
01:50:34,375 --> 01:50:37,457
You love to help the underdog

1285
01:50:37,458 --> 01:50:39,915
Okay, go ahead, make this beggar
woman your daughter-in-law

1286
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:44,166
But I will never accept this jerk as my son-in-law

1287
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:45,583
Daddy, try to understand...

1288
01:50:45,584 --> 01:50:49,040
Shut up. And listen to me very carefully

1289
01:50:49,041 --> 01:50:52,292
The way in which you have
picked a husband off the roadside

1290
01:50:52,458 --> 01:50:56,292
In the same way find a father
to give you away in marriage

1291
01:50:56,458 --> 01:51:01,000
Because after today, I am no longer your father

1292
01:51:02,958 --> 01:51:06,999
Go and be damned

1293
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,083
You who have not a hair on your
head or an emotion in your heart,

1294
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:12,541
what would you Know
about giving anything away

1295
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:15,082
Such things are beyond you

1296
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:18,958
Go, go on, get out, scram

1297
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:29,667
Don't you worry, dear I will
perform the duties of father

1298
01:51:29,833 --> 01:51:33,207
Oh, dear God, mysterious are your ways

1299
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:39,583
Today you have given me a big surprise...

1300
01:52:29,083 --> 01:52:34,083
Come, my love, let us make
merry, for spring is here

1301
01:52:34,667 --> 01:52:40,208
Come, my love, do not tarry,
lest this spring is wasted

1302
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:53,541
Don't worry if sleep is lost,

1303
01:52:53,542 --> 01:52:56,166
Or if peace is stolen

1304
01:52:56,167 --> 01:52:58,708
Or life is lost,

1305
01:52:58,709 --> 01:53:04,750
Let love live on

1306
01:55:48,375 --> 01:55:52,042
Mr. Malhotra, it's so nice of you of
you to have come. I'm really glad

1307
01:55:52,209 --> 01:55:55,249
But how can I ignore an
invitation from you, Mr. Ranjit

1308
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,874
How is that possible!
Tell me one thing, Mr. Ranjit

1309
01:55:57,875 --> 01:55:58,707
Yes, what is it?

1310
01:55:58,708 --> 01:56:02,375
You were looking out for a very
rich girl for your son, weren't you?

1311
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:06,875
But now I hear you have accepted
the daughter of some clerk

1312
01:56:07,042 --> 01:56:10,958
In other words, you had aimed for
the stars but fell on the dung heap!

1313
01:56:12,209 --> 01:56:13,874
How are you, Mr. Malhotra?

1314
01:56:13,875 --> 01:56:14,707
I am well

1315
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:16,416
If you do not mind, can I ask you something?

1316
01:56:16,417 --> 01:56:17,665
No, no, why would I mind it?

1317
01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:19,291
What happened to your daughter?

1318
01:56:19,292 --> 01:56:20,374
Why, what has happened?

1319
01:56:20,375 --> 01:56:23,541
I hear she has made off with a baker!

1320
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,374
Anyway, it is nothing to worry about,

1321
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:29,125
all the bread supplied for this party
is from your son-in-law's bakery

1322
01:56:29,292 --> 01:56:30,458
Come on, open your mouth

1323
01:56:30,459 --> 01:56:33,583
Come on, open your mouth,
old man or I will spill the beans

1324
01:56:34,417 --> 01:56:38,375
Give him water, some one give him water
He is fit to drown with shame

1325
01:56:50,708 --> 01:56:52,582
Come

1326
01:56:52,583 --> 01:56:56,750
Harbu, you have come so far why are
you hesitating for a few more steps

1327
01:56:56,917 --> 01:57:00,583
Come forward and bless your daughter

1328
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:06,459
Daddy, I Knew you would definitely come

1329
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:12,708
It is impossible that while I live I
do not attend your engagement

1330
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:14,582
Where is Raja?

1331
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:20,333
He should be here any minute

1332
01:57:23,541 --> 01:57:26,833
I mean, just look at these rich spoilt brats!

1333
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,166
It is no festival today, but crackers are being lit!

1334
01:57:30,167 --> 01:57:33,082
That too in the middle of the road

1335
01:57:33,083 --> 01:57:35,874
I think this is going to go on through the night

1336
01:57:35,875 --> 01:57:41,375
Let us try and talk them out of it

1337
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:43,374
Look, friend, we...

1338
01:57:43,375 --> 01:57:47,707
Hey, mister

1339
01:57:47,708 --> 01:57:50,749
Why are you lighting crackers?

1340
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:54,583
Just listen to me please. Stop this for
a minute, we have to go from here

1341
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:58,499
Please speak louder, I cannot hear anything

1342
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:01,415
Our taxi has to pass through, please give way

1343
01:58:01,416 --> 01:58:05,167
Listen, stop for a minute, let their taxi pass

1344
01:58:05,334 --> 01:58:06,415
All right

1345
01:58:06,416 --> 01:58:09,166
Thank you, my friend

1346
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:14,458
Let us go

1347
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:20,000
Kajal!

1348
01:58:20,541 --> 01:58:27,041
Uncle, Uncle!

1349
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:50,084
Kajal Kajal?

1350
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:38,792
No, no

1351
02:00:01,708 --> 02:00:02,999
No!

1352
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,875
Hey, Pali, come

1353
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:29,874
While this Knight errant lives,

1354
02:00:29,875 --> 02:00:34,792
no tyrant will be allowed to
outrage a woman's modesty

1355
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:51,458
Get up you rascal, bastard

1356
02:02:17,917 --> 02:02:23,708
Are you okay?

1357
02:02:35,208 --> 02:02:38,583
Madhu, it is quite late but
they haven't come yet

1358
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:40,707
Yeah, it's got me worrying too

1359
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:43,332
You are worrying for no
reason, they will soon be here

1360
02:02:43,333 --> 02:02:45,457
Yes, yes, they will soon be here

1361
02:02:45,458 --> 02:02:49,791
Oh, here they are!

1362
02:02:49,792 --> 02:02:53,125
Hey, where did you two get delay ed?

1363
02:02:53,792 --> 02:02:55,666
Oh, Ajay, you don't Know, the...

1364
02:02:55,667 --> 02:02:58,207
Never mind, these things happen

1365
02:02:58,208 --> 02:03:02,000
It is late already, please get the
engagement ceremony started

1366
02:03:02,166 --> 02:03:05,333
What is the big hurry, Mr. Malhotra

1367
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,208
Friends, a while ago Mr. Malhotra
asked me why I had changed my mind

1368
02:03:12,667 --> 02:03:16,250
Why I had not got my son
married to my friend's daughter

1369
02:03:16,416 --> 02:03:19,207
I want to tell you all...

1370
02:03:19,208 --> 02:03:25,625
that Ajay and his friend Raja
have to be given credit for that

1371
02:03:26,333 --> 02:03:29,708
It is indeed their friendship and
love that changed my thinking

1372
02:03:30,042 --> 02:03:37,333
And it is some pictures of this
friendship that I want to show you all

1373
02:03:37,542 --> 02:03:38,707
Daddy, why are you...

1374
02:03:38,708 --> 02:03:43,333
Son, let a father have his wish

1375
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:49,167
Lights off

1376
02:05:04,375 --> 02:05:06,582
Daddy, what Kind of a game is this?

1377
02:05:06,583 --> 02:05:09,624
Do I still need to tell you what this is?

1378
02:05:09,625 --> 02:05:13,834
These are your friend's doings
which I am showing to you

1379
02:05:14,166 --> 02:05:18,625
I always told you that these poor
people are blood-sucking leeches

1380
02:05:18,792 --> 02:05:21,582
They are parasites which
gobble up your wealth,

1381
02:05:21,583 --> 02:05:25,166
and they rob you of your good name

1382
02:05:25,333 --> 02:05:26,874
These, these...

1383
02:05:26,875 --> 02:05:31,792
see, see how your fiancée has been
having an affair with your friend

1384
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,874
No, no, this is not true, not true

1385
02:05:33,875 --> 02:05:36,624
Okay, so you tell me just
when do two young people,

1386
02:05:36,625 --> 02:05:40,000
meet each other with their
clothes almost half down!

1387
02:05:40,417 --> 02:05:43,500
What do they have in mind
in such a state, tell me

1388
02:05:43,917 --> 02:05:46,541
Ajay, Ajay this is a false accusation

1389
02:05:46,542 --> 02:05:49,750
This is a conspiracy to get us into trouble

1390
02:05:49,917 --> 02:05:53,166
I... I can prove that this is all lies

1391
02:05:53,333 --> 02:05:58,166
Uncle, tell them about the
accident before I came here

1392
02:05:58,333 --> 02:06:02,208
What accident?
We have come here straight

1393
02:06:06,875 --> 02:06:12,458
Uncle don't lie, please
Please don't lie

1394
02:06:13,583 --> 02:06:18,000
This is a matter of my reputation, a
question of your daughter's good name

1395
02:06:18,709 --> 02:06:21,833
Don't lie, please don't lie

1396
02:06:21,834 --> 02:06:26,792
Come here, was I supposed
to say something else?

1397
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:29,082
Tell me what I should say

1398
02:06:29,083 --> 02:06:31,374
Eh! Huh, what are you
whispering amongst each other?

1399
02:06:31,375 --> 02:06:33,291
Whatever you have to say, speak out loud,

1400
02:06:33,292 --> 02:06:35,457
this is a matter of our family's
good name, understand?

1401
02:06:35,458 --> 02:06:38,875
Speak up you bastard! Tell the
truth or I will break your bones

1402
02:06:39,083 --> 02:06:42,624
Please do not beat me, Sir

1403
02:06:42,625 --> 02:06:45,207
I am a very poor man, Sir

1404
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:47,791
I will tell the truth, Sir

1405
02:06:47,792 --> 02:06:54,166
Sir, this niece of mine is not of good character

1406
02:06:55,125 --> 02:07:01,709
She's been carrying on with
Raja for several months now

1407
02:07:04,208 --> 02:07:09,792
Not only that, Sir, but they...
they have also aborted a child, Sir

1408
02:07:09,958 --> 02:07:13,458
You bastard! I will Kill you, I will not spare you

1409
02:07:13,625 --> 02:07:17,250
I will Kill you, I will Kill you bastard

1410
02:07:18,125 --> 02:07:19,749
Stop it

1411
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:25,208
Enough of your nonsense,
I cannot bear it any more

1412
02:07:25,709 --> 02:07:29,208
Ajay! You believe them!

1413
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:40,875
Madhu, at least you should trust
me I am telling the truth, Madhu

1414
02:07:41,125 --> 02:07:44,875
I swear by you that I'm speaking the truth

1415
02:07:47,542 --> 02:07:50,332
Don't you touch me

1416
02:07:50,333 --> 02:07:56,709
I could never believe that
you would stoop so low

1417
02:07:57,375 --> 02:08:00,833
Ajay, tell him to go away from here

1418
02:08:03,916 --> 02:08:07,875
Raja, go away before I lose my head, go

1419
02:08:08,083 --> 02:08:10,541
Ajay, listen to me... Go!

1420
02:08:10,542 --> 02:08:13,541
No, Ajay, until I have proved my innocence

1421
02:08:13,542 --> 02:08:14,624
I will not go away from here

1422
02:08:14,625 --> 02:08:18,584
All right then, it is your dead
body that will leave this house

1423
02:08:19,041 --> 02:08:20,999
Believe me, Ajay
You are telling a lie

1424
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,874
No, I am not telling lies
You cheated me

1425
02:08:22,875 --> 02:08:24,832
Ajay, this is a false accusation
Shut up!

1426
02:08:24,833 --> 02:08:28,167
Ajay, why don't you understand
Shut up, you bastard

1427
02:08:30,667 --> 02:08:32,541
Ajay, you have gone mad

1428
02:08:32,542 --> 02:08:37,416
Get lost

1429
02:08:40,292 --> 02:08:43,207
Ajay, Ajay

1430
02:08:43,208 --> 02:08:46,040
What are you doing, what are you doing

1431
02:08:46,041 --> 02:08:50,000
You're breaking your childhood
friendship, 20 years of friendship

1432
02:08:50,208 --> 02:08:55,416
You have gone mad

1433
02:09:01,375 --> 02:09:06,333
Friendship! I have not broken
our friendship, Uncle, he has

1434
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:09,541
I have given him more than a brother's love

1435
02:09:09,542 --> 02:09:13,166
Loved him more than my life, trusted him

1436
02:09:13,167 --> 02:09:16,166
And what did he do to me!

1437
02:09:16,167 --> 02:09:18,374
To my love, he...

1438
02:09:18,375 --> 02:09:21,332
Uncle, tell him to go away from here

1439
02:09:21,333 --> 02:09:24,791
I don't wish to see his face, tell him to go away

1440
02:10:07,208 --> 02:10:10,584
Kajal, where are you going?

1441
02:10:11,875 --> 02:10:15,707
I don't Know

1442
02:10:15,708 --> 02:10:19,000
Come home with me

1443
02:10:19,167 --> 02:10:22,791
No, I will not be a burden to you

1444
02:10:27,125 --> 02:10:31,666
Is a sister ever a burden to her brother?

1445
02:10:51,375 --> 02:10:55,875
When sleep deserts you

1446
02:11:00,334 --> 02:11:03,875
When memories trouble you

1447
02:11:10,375 --> 02:11:14,000
When the heart is in despair

1448
02:11:18,542 --> 02:11:22,708
When sadness hounds you

1449
02:11:23,708 --> 02:11:30,083
What would you call this,
O my God you tell me

1450
02:11:30,791 --> 02:11:35,167
It is love, it's love, it is love

1451
02:11:36,334 --> 02:11:40,791
Love is failure, love is success

1452
02:11:41,916 --> 02:11:47,000
It is your enemy, and it is your friend

1453
02:11:48,042 --> 02:11:53,250
It is love, it's love, yes indeed it is love

1454
02:16:17,875 --> 02:16:20,166
Kajal

1455
02:16:20,167 --> 02:16:22,124
Kajal, Kajal

1456
02:16:22,125 --> 02:16:23,957
What happened, Kajal?

1457
02:16:23,958 --> 02:16:29,000
Oh, God!

1458
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:35,208
Nurse, excuse me. I want to meet
Dr. Sajan, where can I find him?

1459
02:16:35,209 --> 02:16:38,624
He is in Dr. Neeta Mehta's room
Thank you

1460
02:16:38,625 --> 02:16:40,832
Don't worry she'll be alright
Hey, Raja, what's up?

1461
02:16:40,833 --> 02:16:43,332
Doctor, Kajal is not well,
please take a look at her

1462
02:16:43,333 --> 02:16:46,833
Raja, this is a maternity hospital
and I have come here for a visit

1463
02:16:47,042 --> 02:16:50,416
I cannot see her here. You should
have brought her to my clinic

1464
02:16:50,583 --> 02:16:53,124
That is where I went but
I was told you were here

1465
02:16:53,125 --> 02:16:56,833
She is very ill
Some time ago she had even fainted

1466
02:16:59,167 --> 02:17:01,374
Dr. Mehta, can I use your cabin?

1467
02:17:01,375 --> 02:17:02,582
Of course

1468
02:17:02,583 --> 02:17:03,666
Bring her inside

1469
02:17:03,667 --> 02:17:07,624
Kajal come

1470
02:17:07,625 --> 02:17:10,832
Raja, it is good you brought her here

1471
02:17:10,833 --> 02:17:14,250
Due to depression she has low B. P.

1472
02:17:14,416 --> 02:17:17,541
I am writing out a prescription
Keep giving her the medicines,

1473
02:17:17,708 --> 02:17:22,459
she will be all right

1474
02:17:26,375 --> 02:17:31,375
Careful there

1475
02:17:42,416 --> 02:17:44,083
PLAN YOUR FAM IL Y

1476
02:17:44,084 --> 02:17:47,250
MAMTA MATERNITY HOSPITAL

1477
02:17:54,167 --> 02:17:55,499
Excuse me Yes?

1478
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,124
Why had this boy and girl come here?

1479
02:17:57,125 --> 02:18:03,125
Sir, a man brings his wife here
when she is expecting his child

1480
02:18:22,084 --> 02:18:25,959
Madhu, what is it, honey?

1481
02:18:27,875 --> 02:18:34,458
Daddy, he who is the cause of my untold misery

1482
02:18:35,667 --> 02:18:39,542
He is carrying on as if nothing has happened

1483
02:18:40,375 --> 02:18:43,875
He is not a human being,
he is an animal, an animal

1484
02:18:44,084 --> 02:18:48,708
I Know how horribly you've
been cheated, my child

1485
02:18:49,208 --> 02:18:52,792
As a father I can understand
what you must be suffering

1486
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,207
But even now all is not lost

1487
02:18:55,208 --> 02:18:57,916
Your life can once again be filled with happiness

1488
02:18:57,917 --> 02:18:59,999
You both can learn to smile again

1489
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,624
Just listen to your father's entreaty

1490
02:19:02,625 --> 02:19:06,415
You two get married and set up home

1491
02:19:06,416 --> 02:19:08,083
Daddy

1492
02:19:08,084 --> 02:19:11,165
Don't say no, my child, don't say no

1493
02:19:11,166 --> 02:19:14,041
I have fulfilled all your wishes

1494
02:19:14,042 --> 02:19:18,500
Can you not grant your father his one wish

1495
02:19:18,708 --> 02:19:20,041
Please, my girl

1496
02:19:20,042 --> 02:19:23,333
Daddy, I have already hurt you so much

1497
02:19:23,875 --> 02:19:27,792
If this marriage can give
you even a little happiness

1498
02:19:27,959 --> 02:19:31,959
...then we won't oppose your request

1499
02:19:32,375 --> 02:19:36,083
My dear

1500
02:19:36,084 --> 02:19:37,958
Madhu is right, Daddy

1501
02:19:37,959 --> 02:19:41,166
Why should we all suffer
because of others' unfaithfulness

1502
02:19:41,333 --> 02:19:45,375
Why should I mourn a
relationship that does not exist

1503
02:19:45,959 --> 02:19:50,959
We'll show them, that we can live too

1504
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:55,750
Ajay, whatever you are doing, it is not right

1505
02:19:57,875 --> 02:20:03,041
I don't like this

1506
02:20:03,042 --> 02:20:06,833
Kajal, have your medicine

1507
02:20:06,834 --> 02:20:12,334
Slowly

1508
02:20:18,458 --> 02:20:24,791
Can we come in?

1509
02:20:25,375 --> 02:20:29,000
Come in Ajay, sit down

1510
02:20:35,667 --> 02:20:40,458
No Raja, on this bed only you...

1511
02:20:43,375 --> 02:20:47,166
What nonsense you talk, Ajay
Can't you see her condition

1512
02:20:49,667 --> 02:20:54,166
Kajal, I hear you are not well

1513
02:20:57,917 --> 02:21:01,291
Are you pregnant again?

1514
02:21:07,166 --> 02:21:10,165
Look, Ajay, look at her tears

1515
02:21:10,166 --> 02:21:13,375
Oh this innocent face
could fool any one, isn't it?

1516
02:21:13,542 --> 02:21:16,541
Aren't looks very deceptive?

1517
02:21:16,542 --> 02:21:19,165
Can any one imagine such
innocent looking people,

1518
02:21:19,166 --> 02:21:23,125
could be so low-minded and treacherous?

1519
02:21:23,875 --> 02:21:25,874
They can be, why can't they be

1520
02:21:25,875 --> 02:21:28,666
We have two examples right in front of us,

1521
02:21:28,667 --> 02:21:31,374
who made a deal of everything
to serve their selfish ends,

1522
02:21:31,375 --> 02:21:34,457
their love, their conscience, their very souls

1523
02:21:34,458 --> 02:21:35,874
Will you please shut up?

1524
02:21:35,875 --> 02:21:37,457
You shut up and listen to me

1525
02:21:37,458 --> 02:21:40,624
We have not come here to
watch you enjoying yourself

1526
02:21:40,625 --> 02:21:44,250
But to tell you that we have
decided to get married

1527
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:52,542
This relationship will not
be an illicit one like yours

1528
02:21:53,208 --> 02:21:56,332
Here is our wedding card

1529
02:21:56,333 --> 02:21:59,709
We Are Getting Married

1530
02:22:28,208 --> 02:22:30,332
Kajal

1531
02:22:30,333 --> 02:22:33,709
Kajal, Kajal, open the door Kajal

1532
02:22:34,041 --> 02:22:38,624
Kajal

1533
02:22:38,625 --> 02:22:41,709
Kajal, what are you doing Kajal

1534
02:22:42,875 --> 02:22:46,958
No Kajal, you cannot do this Kajal

1535
02:22:47,875 --> 02:22:51,791
I say, please open the door

1536
02:22:51,792 --> 02:22:54,082
Stop it, Kajal

1537
02:22:54,083 --> 02:22:58,875
What stupidity is this! Kajal, you cannot do this

1538
02:23:05,458 --> 02:23:08,249
No Kajal, come to your senses Kajal
Leave me alone

1539
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:12,749
What are you doing Kajal, stop it

1540
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:17,709
Do you think your death can wipe
away the false accusations put on us?

1541
02:23:17,916 --> 02:23:22,667
No, Kajal, death is not the
answer to this problem

1542
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:29,749
Those who have brought us to this state,

1543
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:35,250
I'll teach them such a lesson
as will not be forgotten ever

1544
02:24:18,792 --> 02:24:23,124
No, Raja!

1545
02:24:23,125 --> 02:24:26,249
No, no

1546
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:31,708
Help, help

1547
02:24:32,125 --> 02:24:37,167
No, leave me, let me go Raja

1548
02:25:07,041 --> 02:25:10,584
No Raja, don't come near me

1549
02:25:26,417 --> 02:25:29,916
You bastard, you're worse than an animal

1550
02:26:33,875 --> 02:26:38,791
Inspector, this is the swine
who is after my son's life

1551
02:26:39,042 --> 02:26:40,707
Arrest him

1552
02:26:40,708 --> 02:26:44,332
C'mon, arrest the rascal

1553
02:26:44,333 --> 02:26:49,333
Move, move

1554
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:15,833
Did you see, Ajay, how badly he treated me

1555
02:27:18,542 --> 02:27:23,499
I will never forgive him

1556
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:29,875
I will never forgive him!

1557
02:27:44,208 --> 02:27:47,542
Come, come, welcome my son

1558
02:27:48,417 --> 02:27:51,333
Please take Ajay inside

1559
02:27:51,334 --> 02:27:55,250
Our dreams have come true, Harbu
We are family now,

1560
02:27:55,459 --> 02:27:57,624
our children are to be married

1561
02:27:57,625 --> 02:28:00,374
Yes, Ranjit, yes, our plans have succeeded

1562
02:28:00,375 --> 02:28:04,541
We have won, we have won

1563
02:28:04,542 --> 02:28:09,417
We are partying here, and there
the bastard is getting a thrashing

1564
02:28:11,958 --> 02:28:15,250
Tried to lay your hands
on a rich man's daughter

1565
02:28:17,459 --> 02:28:22,333
Laying your hands on a girl

1566
02:28:22,334 --> 02:28:25,500
Don't beat him, don't beat him

1567
02:28:26,125 --> 02:28:28,665
For God's sake, don't beat him

1568
02:28:28,666 --> 02:28:31,207
He has not committed any crime

1569
02:28:31,208 --> 02:28:34,500
Raja is innocent, please don't beat him

1570
02:28:34,708 --> 02:28:37,207
He is not innocent, he is a rapist,

1571
02:28:37,208 --> 02:28:39,374
and he'll not leave this place alive

1572
02:28:39,375 --> 02:28:44,667
Thrash the bastard

1573
02:28:51,417 --> 02:28:53,249
Hey, where do you think you are going,

1574
02:28:53,250 --> 02:28:54,832
don't you Know this is a rich people's wedding?

1575
02:28:54,833 --> 02:28:56,041
Listen, Sir, I...

1576
02:28:56,042 --> 02:28:59,708
Bahadur, let her come, let her come in

1577
02:29:04,750 --> 02:29:08,500
Sir, Sir, he will die, Sir

1578
02:29:09,292 --> 02:29:11,416
Please save him, Sir

1579
02:29:11,417 --> 02:29:13,790
Those police people will Kill him, Sir

1580
02:29:13,791 --> 02:29:16,540
I beg you for mercy, Sir

1581
02:29:16,541 --> 02:29:19,082
That dog deserves this punishment

1582
02:29:19,083 --> 02:29:21,874
He had dared to challenge us

1583
02:29:21,875 --> 02:29:24,707
We'll give him a slow death and
make him suffer till the end

1584
02:29:24,708 --> 02:29:26,374
No, no, please don't do that, Sir

1585
02:29:26,375 --> 02:29:29,500
Please Sir, in the name of God spare his life

1586
02:29:30,167 --> 02:29:33,541
I beg of you, please spare his life, Sir

1587
02:29:39,875 --> 02:29:43,791
So, lost all of your starch at last, have you

1588
02:29:44,209 --> 02:29:49,042
You used to shout that love is
very powerful, did you not?

1589
02:29:49,209 --> 02:29:50,832
That love never loses

1590
02:29:50,833 --> 02:29:54,334
Now rub your forehead on these feet and say

1591
02:29:54,625 --> 02:29:58,250
that love has no meaning in front of wealth

1592
02:29:58,666 --> 02:30:01,291
and then I will spare your boyfriend's life

1593
02:30:01,292 --> 02:30:07,000
Go on, rub your forehead

1594
02:30:15,875 --> 02:30:21,875
You are right, Sir, a poor
man's love has no meaning

1595
02:30:22,708 --> 02:30:28,250
No meaning at all

1596
02:30:28,833 --> 02:30:31,333
Another thing,

1597
02:30:31,334 --> 02:30:34,417
if you wish to see him alive, then take him and,

1598
02:30:34,625 --> 02:30:40,125
not only leave this town but go
away from this country forever

1599
02:30:40,292 --> 02:30:44,334
Sir, I will do whatever you say

1600
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:47,124
That's good

1601
02:30:47,125 --> 02:30:52,041
Harbu Yeah, sure

1602
02:30:52,042 --> 02:30:54,499
Inspector, I am Harbans Lal speaking

1603
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,999
Oh Sir, to what do I deserve this honour?

1604
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,832
Let him go Leave him!

1605
02:30:58,833 --> 02:31:00,082
Yes, and listen,

1606
02:31:00,083 --> 02:31:03,041
send that son-of-a-bitch along with his lady love,

1607
02:31:03,042 --> 02:31:07,042
on the evening passenger
ship going to Lagos, Nigeria

1608
02:31:07,541 --> 02:31:11,958
And if you ever see them
again in this town, shoot them

1609
02:31:12,209 --> 02:31:15,500
Whatever you say, Sir

1610
02:31:16,042 --> 02:31:21,209
Go, I have spared your boyfriend's life, go

1611
02:31:33,084 --> 02:31:36,916
I will not leave this town and go

1612
02:31:36,917 --> 02:31:39,874
I will not go this way, in ignominy

1613
02:31:39,875 --> 02:31:44,334
I will prove that we are innocent

1614
02:31:44,541 --> 02:31:49,458
You cannot do that Raja, they will
Kill you before you can do it

1615
02:31:49,666 --> 02:31:54,750
I am ready to die if necessary
to prove my innocence

1616
02:31:54,917 --> 02:31:58,416
If you are thinking of dying,
why did you save me then?

1617
02:31:58,583 --> 02:32:01,749
Why did you give me this life, answer me

1618
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:05,334
I can bear my own ignominy, Raja,

1619
02:32:05,917 --> 02:32:11,375
but I won't be able to see my brother dead

1620
02:32:13,792 --> 02:32:17,209
You called me your sister, did you not

1621
02:32:17,917 --> 02:32:24,292
In the name of that relationship,
I beg you to come along, please

1622
02:32:25,708 --> 02:32:29,500
Nothing is left in this town for us now

1623
02:32:31,167 --> 02:32:36,084
Everything is finished, Raja, everything

1624
02:32:42,042 --> 02:32:48,416
All right, Kajal, I will do what you say

1625
02:32:50,708 --> 02:32:54,792
I am very happy that this relationship
has come through, Mr. Malhotra

1626
02:32:54,958 --> 02:32:56,374
Hearty congratulations

1627
02:32:56,375 --> 02:33:02,000
Call the bride, Sir Yes

1628
02:33:08,375 --> 02:33:11,833
Hurry up, it is time for the ship to sail off

1629
02:33:12,042 --> 02:33:15,832
Pick up your stuff and get in the jeep

1630
02:33:15,833 --> 02:33:22,292
Sit down dear, sit down

1631
02:33:35,333 --> 02:33:39,209
Bride and groom may stand up for
going around the sacred nuptial fire

1632
02:33:45,875 --> 02:33:51,000
Hey, get off

1633
02:33:57,625 --> 02:34:01,667
Hey, why has the light gone off?
Let us see...

1634
02:34:02,291 --> 02:34:05,208
Hey Bihari, hey Ramu Yes, Master

1635
02:34:05,209 --> 02:34:07,374
Why have the chandeliers gone off, find out

1636
02:34:07,375 --> 02:34:12,791
I will just go and check, Master

1637
02:35:07,875 --> 02:35:12,707
You wretch!

1638
02:35:12,708 --> 02:35:15,874
What is this exhibition you have put up?

1639
02:35:15,875 --> 02:35:20,167
What will you prove by showing
these pictures? What will you prove?

1640
02:35:20,333 --> 02:35:24,250
I want to prove what a low-down scum you are

1641
02:35:25,042 --> 02:35:28,500
Today I will show the world your real face

1642
02:35:28,708 --> 02:35:29,624
Listen Ajay...

1643
02:35:29,625 --> 02:35:32,624
On the night that Kajal and Raja were
coming to the engagement party

1644
02:35:32,625 --> 02:35:36,834
your father's hired goons
Kidnapped Kajal

1645
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:40,207
They tore off her clothes,

1646
02:35:40,208 --> 02:35:43,415
they behaved like animals with her

1647
02:35:43,416 --> 02:35:46,583
It was your friend, Raja, who saved her then

1648
02:35:47,084 --> 02:35:51,542
And when he was consoling
that terrified girl like a brother

1649
02:35:51,708 --> 02:35:54,707
...these photographs were taken,

1650
02:35:54,708 --> 02:35:58,875
which were presented in a totally
different context by your FATHER

1651
02:35:59,042 --> 02:36:05,084
Raja Kept screaming that he was
innocent but you didn't believe him

1652
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:12,208
So to prove his innocence,
Raja re-enacted this scene last night

1653
02:36:12,667 --> 02:36:14,707
He carried off Madhu in the same way

1654
02:36:14,708 --> 02:36:17,165
and you too saved Madhu in the same way

1655
02:36:17,166 --> 02:36:20,249
And when you were consoling this terrified girl

1656
02:36:20,250 --> 02:36:22,958
these photographs were
taken at that time by us

1657
02:36:22,959 --> 02:36:26,166
so that you can see the truth for yourself

1658
02:36:26,708 --> 02:36:29,792
And if you still have doubts,
then ask this scoundrel

1659
02:36:29,959 --> 02:36:33,041
who is an equal partner in
your father's conspiracy

1660
02:36:33,042 --> 02:36:36,500
Speak up you dog, admit it in front of him

1661
02:36:36,875 --> 02:36:40,333
Sir I am telling the truth I am guilty, Sir

1662
02:36:40,542 --> 02:36:44,000
All that I said in the party
that day, it was all untrue

1663
02:36:44,208 --> 02:36:49,125
Your father had paid me 200,
000 rupees to say all that

1664
02:37:15,792 --> 02:37:20,500
You have Killed the bond
between father and son

1665
02:37:21,166 --> 02:37:24,416
Such an enormous betrayal!

1666
02:37:24,417 --> 02:37:28,166
Why did you cheat me so, why?

1667
02:37:28,875 --> 02:37:33,291
Why did you do it, why, why, why did you?

1668
02:37:33,709 --> 02:37:36,749
Why have you ruined my life?

1669
02:37:36,750 --> 02:37:40,166
Leave me, I will Kill him

1670
02:37:41,041 --> 02:37:46,333
Leave me, I will Kill him, he has ruined my life

1671
02:37:46,625 --> 02:37:52,041
You are a criminal, I will not
spare you I will Kill you

1672
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,374
Ajay, what are you doing?

1673
02:37:56,375 --> 02:38:00,041
He is your father, let him go, let him go

1674
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:20,542
No Ajay, no, no, stop Ajay

1675
02:38:21,041 --> 02:38:22,916
Leave me, I want to die

1676
02:38:22,917 --> 02:38:26,124
What are you saying, come to your senses

1677
02:38:26,125 --> 02:38:29,833
No I don't want to live, Madhu I wish to die

1678
02:38:29,834 --> 02:38:33,875
Because of this man I cannot look
any one in the eye. Let me go

1679
02:38:34,083 --> 02:38:37,625
He cannot be my father, Madhu
He cannot be

1680
02:38:38,208 --> 02:38:41,875
One even begins to love
animals that he Keeps as pets

1681
02:38:42,041 --> 02:38:46,250
But this man has treated his
own son worse than an animal

1682
02:38:46,792 --> 02:38:51,500
Madhu, he cannot be my
father, he cannot be my father

1683
02:38:56,083 --> 02:39:01,458
Ajay, calm down, calm down for God's sake

1684
02:39:02,709 --> 02:39:07,041
This man has ruined my life

1685
02:39:13,041 --> 02:39:17,542
Because of this man I doubted my love

1686
02:39:18,083 --> 02:39:22,375
I raised my hand on a friend
who was like a brother to me

1687
02:39:22,875 --> 02:39:29,166
And today, because of him, I was
going to commit such a big blunder

1688
02:39:29,917 --> 02:39:34,458
No Madhu, I can't even face myself

1689
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:40,041
I don't wish to live Madhu, I don't wish to live

1690
02:39:43,584 --> 02:39:47,916
Ajay, I can understand your pain

1691
02:39:48,542 --> 02:39:53,125
I am also suffering like you

1692
02:39:54,875 --> 02:39:58,083
Because my folks have done the same to me

1693
02:39:59,208 --> 02:40:02,709
I have also been cheated

1694
02:40:03,542 --> 02:40:08,834
But this is no time to punish ourselves, Ajay

1695
02:40:09,625 --> 02:40:12,791
It is time to ask forgiveness of those

1696
02:40:12,792 --> 02:40:17,916
whose life has been turned
into a hell because of us

1697
02:40:18,834 --> 02:40:25,834
Yes, Ajay we will go to them
and will beg for their forgiveness

1698
02:40:27,709 --> 02:40:35,125
It is the only way to repent for our sins, Ajay

1699
02:40:35,292 --> 02:40:38,207
She is right, son

1700
02:40:38,208 --> 02:40:41,834
Go and stop them before it is too late

1701
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:47,125
Because they are leaving the country for good

1702
02:41:04,709 --> 02:41:09,207
Hey, watch it

1703
02:41:09,208 --> 02:41:11,624
Hurry up, hurry, the ship is about to leave

1704
02:41:11,625 --> 02:41:17,207
...passengers are requested
to get their luggage checked

1705
02:41:17,208 --> 02:41:21,124
No!

1706
02:41:21,125 --> 02:41:22,499
Ajay!

1707
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:24,499
Oh, there has been an
accident I hope he is not hurt

1708
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:27,291
What has happened, what is it?

1709
02:41:27,292 --> 02:41:33,333
Listen, if I see you in this town
again, I will shoot you. Got it?

1710
02:41:34,750 --> 02:41:39,833
Come on, Kajal

1711
02:41:50,083 --> 02:41:54,833
Ajay

1712
02:42:10,375 --> 02:42:13,374
Prepare for the sail off
Lift the Anchor

1713
02:42:13,375 --> 02:42:14,666
Hey, where are you going?

1714
02:42:14,667 --> 02:42:16,040
Sir, Sir... You cannot go inside

1715
02:42:16,041 --> 02:42:19,333
Call the crane and prepare
to remove the gangway

1716
02:42:19,500 --> 02:42:22,625
Sir, this is a question of my
life and death, I beg of you

1717
02:42:22,833 --> 02:42:24,915
Sir, please let me go

1718
02:42:24,916 --> 02:42:26,708
Sir?

1719
02:42:26,709 --> 02:42:28,541
Okay, let them in

1720
02:42:28,542 --> 02:42:33,458
Thank you, Sir

1721
02:42:51,333 --> 02:42:53,957
Ajay!

1722
02:42:53,958 --> 02:42:59,167
Ajay, Ajay, are you all right?

1723
02:43:53,584 --> 02:43:58,542
Love, it is love, yes indeed this is love

1724
02:43:59,708 --> 02:44:04,791
Yes this is love

1725
02:44:37,375 --> 02:44:39,832
Forgive me

1726
02:44:39,833 --> 02:44:42,374
I have made a terrible mistake, Raja

1727
02:44:42,375 --> 02:44:44,832
Please say no more, Ajay

1728
02:44:44,833 --> 02:44:46,707
Raja, forgive me Raja

1729
02:44:46,708 --> 02:44:51,249
Say nothing, Ajay

1730
02:44:51,250 --> 02:44:52,707
Kajal

1731
02:44:52,708 --> 02:44:55,249
No Forgive me, forgive me

1732
02:44:55,250 --> 02:45:01,708
Don't say anything now

1733
02:45:58,292 --> 02:45:59,665
Mr. Ranjit!

1734
02:45:59,666 --> 02:46:04,541
Why did you call up to have this
ship delay ed by half an hour?

1735
02:46:06,250 --> 02:46:09,292
If this ship had sailed off today,

1736
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:15,334
We would have lost the
regard of our children for ever

1737
02:46:17,833 --> 02:46:22,125
All our life we thought of the
poor as insignificant insects

1738
02:46:22,666 --> 02:46:24,540
Thought of them as guttersnipes

1739
02:46:24,541 --> 02:46:31,334
But today we realize how poor
one really is in spite of wealth

1740
02:46:33,541 --> 02:46:36,791
You children, are our real wealth,

1741
02:46:36,958 --> 02:46:42,667
Yes, it's just you

1742
02:46:43,167 --> 02:46:47,125
When children make
mistakes, parents forgive them

1743
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:50,582
But when parents make mistakes,

1744
02:46:50,583 --> 02:46:53,333
it is the duty of the children also to forgive them

1745
02:46:53,334 --> 02:46:55,374
Forgive me, my children

1746
02:46:55,375 --> 02:46:59,874
Daddy!

1747
02:46:59,875 --> 02:47:05,875
Well done, brother-in-law

1748
02:47:06,583 --> 02:47:10,333
you even straightened the dog's crooked tail!

1749
02:47:10,334 --> 02:47:15,041
Just Kidding.
