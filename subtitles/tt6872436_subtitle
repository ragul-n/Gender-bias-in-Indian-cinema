'No birds or animals were harmed
during the making of this film'

3
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
'Today 5 a.m'

4
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,760
'Chance'

5
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
'Circumstance'

6
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
'Time'

7
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,600
'These 3 factors show
the other face of a man'

8
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,760
'I am in that kind of situation now'

9
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,240
'If I tell you I am the cause
for this dilemma...'

10
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,880
'...will you believe me?'

11
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,680
'North Chennai is famous for
both legal and illegal business'

12
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,360
'Vehicle seizing'

13
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,120
'This business was started
by a financier Bhupal Jain Sait'

14
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,400
'But in this business...'

15
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,800
'...he did not expect to face
such humiliation and loss'

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,760
'He decided to go back
to his hometown'

17
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,640
'That was when his son
volunteered to channelize it'

18
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,320
'His pillar of strength
was my uncle Dorai'

19
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,560
'Dorai's right hand was Ravi'

20
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,760
Where's the key?

21
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,960

earning a lot of money, name and fame'

a gang war in Otteri'

'Dorai's hand was chopped in the brawl'

25
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,560
'Then they were in a dilemma
as to who will take Dorai's place'

26
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,520
Sait, Doraianna is incapacitated now

27
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll take care of seizing vehicles

28
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,160
I should select my successor

29
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Let Sait decide

30
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,920
'Listen, Sait'

31
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,920
My nephew Sketch will take
my place, I'll support him

32
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
- Don't worry
- Sait, it is your call

33
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,440
Ravi, Dorai is very important for me

34
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,320
I'm not important to you
Fine, see you

35
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
You'll come to me complaining
these amateurs failed you

36
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,360
I'll be waiting for
that day to dawn, sait

37
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,040
'Even if he leaves this place...'

38
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,480
'...he has to come back here
and finish me off'

39
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,080
'I know this is his plan'

40
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,720
'I am just an employee here'

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,880
'But I am treated
like the king of this garage'

42
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,120
'They are my friends'

43
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,240

44
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,480
'To sketch out a plan and seize
any vehicle whose due hasn't been paid'

45
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,760
'And bring it to the garage
in time is our job'

46
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,760
"Plan a sketch precisely"

47
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,480
I knew when he called me
you would have seized his bike

48
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,200
Depends on who seized it!

49
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,320
If Sketch sketches a plan
the sketch won't go amiss

50
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,560
Only if it misses
let me know

51
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,360
I'll finish it
without any knots

52
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
Don't show off, go

53
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,320

All just a piece of cake"

Bike skids, you're out of the race"

68
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,000
"You'll end up in paradise
Sketch is sharp and wise"

69
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440
"He learnt to sketch a winner
Now it works in Sketch's favor"

Sketch is sweet & sour potpourri"

78
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,480
"Foreigners schemed slyly
to ban 'Jallikattu' fully"

79
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,360
"Tamil Nadu came up trumps successfully"

80
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,200

"If you rip open his heart
it's pure gold, 24 carat"

94
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Sait, I gave my car for servicing
All my stuff is missing

95
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Who cleaned my car?

96
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,880
- I did
- You cleaned?

97
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,240
What?

98
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,160
Don't hit our boys

99
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,560
Hey! Go

100
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,480
So early in the day
he's creating a ruckus?

101
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,040
Don't know, he says
his stuff is missing

102
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,280
He's suspecting our boys

103
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,080
They hand over mobiles or wallets
they see in the cars

104
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
- What bottle or cap?
- His car is a rattletrap!

105
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,200
I had kept methanol to clean my glass

106
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,760
You're educated, right?

107
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,520
You'll die if even 1 drop
falls in the air conditioner

108
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,040
That's why he must have thrashed it

109
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
One chap will throw
Another will mediate, huh?

110
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,480
Just bring it and
fling it back in his car

111
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
Don't know who I am

112
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,600
Even you don't know who you are!

113
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,800
What do you say, sait?

114
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,680
This is how tense you will be
if you dye even the hair in your ears!

115
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
Bye, uncle

116
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,120
Where's my methanol box?

117
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,080
Hey! Sniff it under his nose

118
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,400
'What a jam! Killing us
in this blistering heat'

119
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
'Why are you getting bugged?'

120
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
'It will take an hour
to move from here'

121
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,680
What happened?

122
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
Are you new to this city?

123
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,520
Royapuram Kumar

124
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,600
- Paying respects to his father's tomb
- In the middle of this road?

125
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,440
When his father died
they buried the old man here

126
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
'This place was full of brambles'

127
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,160
He bought this place

128
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Govt tried to grab this place
claiming to lay a highway road

129
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,480
'He requested permission from
the Govt for 1 hour every year'

130
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,560
'Govt relented seeing
his affluence and thug status'

131
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,400
'Who has gone to buy the garland?'

132
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,040
Our politician friend
wanted to sentimentally

133
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,640
'At snail's pace, huh?'

134
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,960
You say he's a big shot
He owns this tinbox?

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,120
Listen, he has a fleet of cars

136
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,760
'But this car is his favorite'

137
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
'He won't let anyone touch it'

138
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,600
'Kumar got a prefix to
his name as Royapuram'

139
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
'...only after he bought that car'

140
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
MLA has come

141
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,240
Am I the scapegoat
for your political gimmicks?

142
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,320
Only because of that
you revel as a rowdy, right?

143
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
Siva was one of us

144
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,360
Let him do his business
Why hassle him without reason?

145
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,080
Let's discuss and compromise

146
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,800
I'll bring him over to your place

147
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Fine, bring him
We'll resolve it

148
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,640
'Praise be to the Giver of Life,
Remover of pain and strife'

149
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,640
'You are the most acceptable intelligence
May Your inspiration pass on to us'

150
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,320
Ammu...?

151
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,480
Hi Priya

152
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,280
- Bye, ma
- Enough!

153
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
Good luck

154
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,320
Showing off with your scooty

155
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,240
My dad hurt his leg
So he hasn't gone to work

156
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,800
- You'll ride?
- No...no, I'll trust you

157
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,720
Bye

158
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,280
You lost your scooty
Did you file a complaint?

159
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,400
I did but I have no hopes
in getting it back

160
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,120
After our exam
we must go to the library

161
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,480
Define the electronic data
interchange and-

162
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,480
What?

163
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,360
- My hall ticket is in my scooty
- Gawd! Hurry up

164
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,400
Where's your scooty?

165
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,280
I parked it right here
It is missing

166
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,280
Security anna
Did you see our scooty?

167
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
I went to the canteen

168
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,560
We trust you and park, right?

169
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
- Did you take the keys?
- I forgot

170
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,920
How can anyone be so careless, huh?

171
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,920
Can't differentiate
a license and ID card

172
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,040
Stupid college!

173
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,440
Isn't that your bike?

174
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,720
Yes

175
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,560
Who are you?
Why did you take our scooty?

176
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,360
Yours, huh?
Why are you yelling?

177
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,680
You'll steal my scooty
and reprimand me?

178
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
Hello

179
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,960
Who is the thief?

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,560
You think the thief will return it?

181
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,640
- Sketch, you sympathized
- 1 minute

182
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,240
I found your hall ticket

183
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,080
I wouldn't have come otherwise

184
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,320
So you'll take it
without permission?

185
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,120
Why are you raising your voice?

186
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,560
Your father is Narayanan, right?

187
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,840
That's my father, sir

188
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
Sir, huh?

189
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,680
Are you Narayanan's daughter?

190
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,920
If he doesn't pay EMI for 4 months,
then what do you expect?

191
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
Only 4 months, no?

192
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,440
Hey! Take him away

193
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,960
Won't you shut up?

194
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,800
Come

195
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,760
Ask your father to pay and take it

196
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
Thanks, sir

197
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,560
Sir?

198
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,000
He's a thief

199
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,000
- How can you thank him?
- Keep quiet

200
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
Give me your address
I'll bring my lawyer

201
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,560
Whether lawyer or a Mr Nair
come with cash to settle the dues

202
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,720
Let's go

203
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,480
Excuse me

204
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,880
All the best

205
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
How sweet!

206
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,480
Excuse me

207
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,800
Narayanan's daughter
Why do girls ignore me?!

208
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't simper

209
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,680
With this as excuse
they will follow you

210
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,680
Don't be surprised
if they land up at your doorstep

211
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,640
You're imagining too much

212
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,360
You've made
my coffee like spicy gravy

213
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,520
Like chilli hot gravy?

214
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,080
Give me rice, I'll dip it
in this and feed you

215
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,440
'And a doubt, huh?'

216
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,440
He should fit the bill, right?

217
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,080
That's also true

218
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,000
Many such tea vendors
con innocent people!

219
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,400
- Don't yell!
- Don't look at him

220
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
This tea is yuck

221
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
'I told you not to turn'

222
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,760
They have followed you
up to our road

223
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,920
Why did you grin
when he gave your hall ticket?

224
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
- Keep the balance
- Thanks, sir

225
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,800
He didn't even give us a 2nd glance

226
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,440
Don't let your imagination run wild

227
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
He's a thief
He pretends very well

228
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,600
Don't keep looking back

229
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,240
He'll come to your house then

230
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,960
'My little princess'

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,080
Please eat

232
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,280
Hey! My scooty

233
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,840
Look, your aunt is coming

234
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,120
We'll go with her
and buy candies

235
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,200
Don't cry, moppet

236
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,280
Look at this akka

237
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
Who brought the scooter back?

238
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,880
We didn't pay EMI
so they seized it

239
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Dad said he'll pay and
asked them to return it

240
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,920
They brought it back
and they are over there

241
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
How did Valli fall for you?

242
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,840
You painted such a negative picture

243
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,720
Take everything
on a positive note

244
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,440
'He won't hit
Rs 500 bet'

245
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,000
'Do it, Sketch
Rs 500 is at stake'

246
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,760
'Don't hit for my sake please'

247
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,520
Chinni, come here

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
Bull's eye, machan

249
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,320
- Called me?
- Did you smoke?

250
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,240
- No, bro
- Don't fib

251
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,640
Did you or did you not?

252
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,640
Just 1, bro

253
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,120
At this young age-

254
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
If I catch you once more, get lost!

255
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,920
'Only 1 it seems'

256
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,240
Guna, your girl is coming

257
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,080
'Why is she coming here?'

258
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,040
'Who is at the back?
Her mother?'

259
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,640
Don't snitch

260
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,960
I've been telling you

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,520
Councillor's son is hounding me

262
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,880
You ignored it
I told him I have a boyfriend

263
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,480
He grabbed my mobile and said...

264
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,960
'Bring your guy to retrieve your mobile'

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,440
Come and get it back

266
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,120
That's a worn out mobile

267
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,040
I wanted to get you a new one

268
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,960
I'll get you a new mobile tomorrow
Clear out now

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
She has a problem

270
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,800
Instead of solving it
you're making fun of her

271
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,080
Where will he be?

272
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,360
"Sketch a plan with elan"

273
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,560
"Sketch a plan neat"

274
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,160
"On the dot complete"

275
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
"Plan it to the T"

276
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,720
"Subtly and deftly
Bullets from a gun swiftly"

277
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,440
"Go for the jugular
Close his chapter"

278
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,640
"Plan it wisely
Bullets from a gun precisely"

279
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,400
"Aim for the wise guy
That's it, bull's eye!"

280
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,160
I'm here just to play

281
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm also here just to play

282
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,680
"Sketch a plan with elan"

283
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,280
Acting smart with me?

284
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,640
You know who my dad is?!

285
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,440
We should ask his mother
who his father is, right?

286
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,920
He's asking me instead
Isn't that a blunder?

287
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,000
Wrong, sir

288
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,760
How can you agree
with him like a nitwit?

289
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
I'll be back

290
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,400
Don't get flustered

291
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,920
Drink juice, fluids
and tender coconut water

292
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm not responsible if you
fall sick eating solids, okay?

293
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,360
"Plan it to a T
His final journey"

294
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,880
When this hen is taken to the shop
it knows it will be cooked in a gravy!

295
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,360
Still it will crow its throat hoarse

296
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,280
It probably crows
knowing its end is near

297
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,560
But passers-by will think it is
putting on a brave front, right?

298
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,880
Yes, sir

299
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,080
Fear in gallons tucked in, why do you
roam around with such false bravado?

300
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,840
Her mobile?

301
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,480
Hey! Give him that phone

302
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,000
"Plan a sketch"

303
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,720
Good boy!

304
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
- Thank you, brother
- Okay, sir

305
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,760
Hello, please come

306
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,520
Welcome to our showroom

307
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll be shelling out cash

308
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,320
Sorry, didn't notice you

309
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,560
If you see a girl,
you won't see the guy

310
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
Wow! Awesome bike

311
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,480
Hey! 'Dalda'

312
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,640
1st let's get you a cycle
and then a bike

313
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,200
Is he your wife's brother?

314
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,200
Yes

315
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,360
My dear papaya

316
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,200
My wife has 1 more brother

317
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,920
He wanted to study law

318
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,360
I sponsored that rascal's education
He sued me as his 1st case!

319
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,480
Then why are you
being nice to him?

320
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,080
He shouldn't end up the same

321
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,360
You're indeed great

322
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
What's the next
new model you're selling?

323
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,920
With gear or without?

324
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,800
- I always prefer no gear
- Anything special?

325
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,080
A bike with a gear is like your wife

326
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,560
We have to obey its commands

327
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,880
A bike with no gear is a mistress
She'll listen to our orders

328
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Why are you getting
into this idle chat?

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
Manju, can't you see
I'm talking to sir?

330
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
I ticked her off

331
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,360
A wife is generally a torture, right?

332
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Connected by a copper wire is electricity

333
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,200
Linked by a sacred thread is wifey!

334
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
You'll get electrocuted if you touch it

335
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
This is ditto but 24x7x366!

336
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,240
Super 'matter', sir

337
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,760
Who is he referring to as 'glamdoll'?

338
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,040
- 'Shall we go for a test drive?'
- By all means!

339
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm trying for a new bike
You're trying for a 2nd hand?

340
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,840
Our showroom is very lucky

341
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,680
Any bike you touch
instant delivery

342
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,040
Is that so? Then why
hasn't this delivered as yet?

343
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,560
Your test drive vehicle
is outside, come along

344
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Aiyo! Where is he?

345
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,320
There he is!

346
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
Come...come, son-in-law

347
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,960
In 1 hour just watch
how I'll disguise all 3 bikes

348
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,640
Even the boss won't be able to guess

349
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
You rock, son-in-law

350
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,240
Get lost!

351
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,440
1 more daughter like you
I would've got 2 more bikes!

352
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,680
Throw me the spanner
Hey! Don't aim for my knee

353
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
Is this a job to be proud of?

354
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,640
Same old story every month

355
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,800
Am I not taking care
of you like a princess?

356
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,640
Sound like a broken record!

357
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,680
Dorai, Councillor was
supposed to come

358
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,160
You are known to me
So I volunteered to mediate

359
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
You and mediation?

360
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,960
Since it's my area,
why did you ignore me?

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They roughed up the councillor's son

362
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,520
He is furious

363
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,400
Forget him being furious

364
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,520
Won't you 1st hear both sides?

365
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,720
Natural for boys to flip for a girl

366
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,240
Ask Sketch to apologize

367
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,600
The boys will cool down

368
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,280
If a teacher intervenes
when boys squabble, she is wrong

369
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,680
How can the maid butt in?!

370
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,760
Dorai, I have no problem

371
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,080
We have 2 hands
to eat and clean

372
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,840
But poor you!
Stuck with just 1 hand

373
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,640
If you dare deride my uncle
you'll be minus a tongue!

374
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,480
I challenge you to come near me

375
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,680
- I can tackle him
- I asked you to clear out

376
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,560
Ravi, this is wrong
Leave quietly

377
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,320
Sketch is calm because of his uncle

378
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,240
Sait, is this why
you called me to your den?

379
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,200
What will you do
if we come to yours?

380
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Sketch!

381
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,400
Hey! Didn't I ask you to clear out?

382
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,640
You heard him, right?
Go...clear out

383
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,400
- Clear out
- Out of here

384
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,880
Get lost!

385
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,800
'Hey! Why are you honking?'

386
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,080
I shouldn't hear your horn
till you cross my gate

387
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,160
'Must be a loose contact, uncle'

388
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,040
Our beacon of light!

389
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,040
'Tell me, Sekar'

390
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,480
I want my daughter Gayatri
to marry your younger son

391
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,680
That's good news

392
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,800
- How are you?
- I am fine

393
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,720
Your son and my daughter
are well educated

394
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,120
They will share the same wavelength

395
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
Anyway why don't you consult your son?

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,680
- Murali?
- Appa?

397
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,600
- Hello?
- Hello, uncle

398
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,320
I've decided to get you married
to Sekar uncle's daughter, okay?

399
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,840
- Whatever you decide, pa
- Okay

400
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
I'm glad this ended on a happy note

401
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,120
'Let me start making arrangements'

402
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
Hope you're doing good

403
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,880
How is this fair to fix a bride for Murali
when our older son is still single?

404
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,400
You heard what he said?

405
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,200
Both are educated and
will understand each other

406
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
If he acts like a rowdy,
seizes vehicles and loafs around

407
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,880
...will he get an educated bride?

408
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,600
'Put it on record, he'll get
a shrew or an useless bumpkin'

409
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
You'll do this deliberately

410
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
- When did you come?
- I didn't hear anything

411
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,360
You said Sketch won't come

412
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,640
- Not enough booze
- You don't drink

413
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,440
Hey! Sketch, come

414
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,680
- Come, machan
- Why such a long face?

415
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Go slow, you'll die
of liver failure

416
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,160
What's with you?
Drinking it raw!

417
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Don't know why

418
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,520
- Doesn't matter if I die
- Why?

419
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
I don't know why my father hates me

420
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,400
- Not mine, yours
- Shut up!

421
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,600
- You know Sekar uncle
- Your father's friend

422
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,560
He wants his daughter
to marry my brother

423
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,120
That's his problem

424
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,120
My mother asked how he can
ignore the older son?

425
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,760
My father said, 'he will get a shrew
or someone as useless as him'

426
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,520
Land owner himself said 'waste' huh?

427
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,720
How can he say that!
I'll give him a piece of my mind

428
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,000
- Forget it
- I will ask

429
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,920
I'll take home a soooper girl
and tarnish his face with coal!

430
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
He's already like burnt cinders!

431
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,920
Your share also gone!

432
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,120
Didn't I see a girl in that college?

433
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,040
The one who thanked us, huh?

434
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,280
That's all out-dated

435
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,320
To thank someone for a favor

436
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,240
- Your girl
- Doesn't matter

437
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,880
Next to her was a girl
light and white like a momo

438
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,720
Wheat complexion

439
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,400
Yelled nineteen to a dozen?

440
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,600
She thought I was wrong and yelled

441
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,760
She fought for someone else's item

442
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,280
Machan, her good heart appealed to me

443
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,640
- Super
- But she won't comply

444
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,720
- She's a Brahmin
- How do you know?

445
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,840
You can recognize
a bike by its sound

446
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,880
I can guess by a girl's belch
if she ate curd rice or mutton

447
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,320
- How?
- God's gift to me

448
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
'You aren't blessed'

449
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,880
I'll tell her I like her
Okay means, my life starts

450
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Okay

451
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,560
I offered it to you

452
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,480
Take a week to think it over
But I'm sure you can't

453
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
Why not?

454
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
I'll show you in 2 days

455
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,080
Hit on!
Go ahead

456
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,680
Looks like it will rain
Go home

457
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
Sir has come

458
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,520
Hold

459
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,640
Give me a plate of 'atho'

460
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm starving

461
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,040
You've come with VIPs, huh?

462
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,600
Siva seems to have gone up the ladder

463
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,120
Earlier on he'll get up
when I come with respect

464
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,680
Now he sits as my equal

465
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,560
Why do you bring him down like that?

466
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,680
Then what?

467
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,320
He wants to skyrocket
Isn't that wrong?

468
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,320
MLA, discuss only what you came here-

469
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,880
Siva, will you keep quiet?

470
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Sir, let him attend to his business

471
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,360
He won't cross swords with you
Same goes for you

472
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,200
Then you mean to say
he intends crossing my path?

473
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,360
No, I didn't really mean that

474
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,640
Anna...bro!

475
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,400
Brother!

476
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,840
Live with the fear of how
your brother was killed, run now

477
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,280
You said compromise
and you killed him

478
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,640
What could I do?
He made the 1st move

479
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,800
So I had no other go

480
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,600
They won't even let me
eat 'atho' in peace!

481
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,800
'Notorious rowdy Siva was found dead
last night with his neck slit'

482
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,040
'A special task force is
tracking down the killer'

483
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,920
Why are you glaring at me?

484
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,120
Lie down in a drunken stupor
and gulp lemon soda next day

485
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,040
But you want to fall in love

486
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,440
If you challenge flicking a bike, fine

487
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,080
But what gall to say you'll fall
in love, that too within 2 days

488
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,840
Think you're cupid's son!

489
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,280
He'll just put her into his pocket, huh?!

490
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,600
Not necessary at all

491
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,480
Priya?

492
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,840
Priya?

493
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,240
'I am coming!'

494
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,040
She's pretty too

495
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,800
So sorry

496
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,000
As if this is new

497
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
We go late to college daily

498
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,760
'Your sari is ruined now!'

499
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,280
Sketch, why did you ask us to come?

500
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
You said...no, didn't you tell me?

501
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,800
- That girl won't talk to me
- Yes, I did

502
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,880
I am repeating it even now

503
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,600
I professed my love yesterday
in Tennis corner

504
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,560
- Look at that!
- I think she likes me

505
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,360
I can't roam around in parks,
beach and theaters

506
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,560
If she likes me
I told her to come in yellow

507
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,840
- What color?
- Yellow

508
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,560
- Good choice
- True that?

509
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,640
Has the bus come?

510
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,600
Waiting for half an hour

511
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,200
The bus...look!

512
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,320
Cover me

513
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,880
'She shouldn't see me'

514
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,000
Sketch...!

515
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Yellow yellow
Lucky fellow!

516
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,480
'Good lord!'

517
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,840
How did her saree become a 'salwar'?

518
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,800
"A fantasy, a dream
A novelty theme"

519
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,160
"When I'm awake too
my dreams continue"

520
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,840
"Like a bird in the sky
my mind sprouts wings to fly"

521
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,560
"Alone, I lower defenses
Losing all my senses"

522
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,600
"As love drizzles in the distance
my mind drenches with happiness"

523
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,320
"The tiny raindrops blur and eclipse"

524
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,280
"The moment I set eyes on you
I melted, softened, thawed anew"

525
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,640
"My feet not listening to me
follow you diligently"

526
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,000
"Is this true or my imagination?
I ask myself in hesitation"

527
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,640
"Hey! My lassie so lovely"

528
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,840
"You mesmerized me totally"

529
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,640
"In my eyes because I treasured you duly
without lowering my lashes; protectively"

530
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,040
"I embroidered you in my heart in ecstasy
Now I am in a dizzied state so tipsy"

531
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,360
"Because in my eyes I cherished you true
Not lowering my lashes; I waited for you"

532
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,000
"I knitted you in my heart in delight
Now look at my flustered plight"

533
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,880
"Don't fence my love with a gate
My heart will be too heavy a mandate"

534
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,360
"When you look cutely
my heart hums a melody"

535
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,920
"Your strawberry eyes, dear
made my breath sear"

536
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,840
"My attitude and arrogance
vanished into thin air at once"

537
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,640
"Don't fence my love with a gate
My heart will be too heavy a mandate"

538
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,080
"A cute look from you
my heart sings anew"

539
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,720
"Your strawberry eyes dreamy
my breath got steamy"

540
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,680
"My attitude and arrogance
vanished into thin air at once"

541
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,320
"My dream of ecstasy"

542
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
"Illusion's treat; fantasy"

543
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
'His girl is calling'

544
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,560
'- Pick it up
- Give it'

545
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
Hello?

546
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,160
- Who is it?
- Your girl

547
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,840
- Go on, talk
- As if she'll talk to me

548
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,640
- Oh! He is Chitti
- She'll talk only to him, huh?

549
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,920
Hope you are paying your EMI properly

550
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,480
"With a single glance you conquered me"

551
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,080
"With her words she poleaxed me instantly"

552
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,800
"Was it you, tell me?"

553
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,680
"In a girl's heart soft and tender
a rage of fury (f)lashes a fiery character"

554
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,600
"In my eyes because I treasured you duly
without lowering my lashes; protectively"

555
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,960
"I embroidered you in my heart in ecstasy
Now I am in a dizzied state so tipsy"

556
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,200
"Because in my eyes I cherished you true
Not lowering my lashes; I waited for you"

557
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,760
"I knitted you in my heart in delight
Now look at my flustered plight"

558
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,720
"Don't fence my love with a gate
My heart will be too heavy a mandate"

559
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,280
"When you look cutely
my heart hums a melody"

560
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,000
"Your strawberry eyes, dear
made my breath sear"

561
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,680
"My attitude and arrogance
vanished into thin air at once"

562
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
"Don't fence my love with a gate
My heart will be too heavy a mandate"

563
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,920
"A cute look from you
my heart sings anew"

564
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,640
"Your strawberry eyes dreamy
my breath got steamy"

565
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,560
"My attitude and arrogance
vanished into thin air at once"

566
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,680
"A fantasy, a dream
A novelty theme"

567
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,160
"When I'm awake too
my dreams continue"

568
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,120
"Like a bird in the sky
my mind sprouts wings to fly"

569
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,360
A new officer Shakthivel
will be heading this unit

570
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,280
He is an irregular policeman

571
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,240
He won't shave or wear uniform

572
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,840
He won't respect any officer

573
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,480
He isn't in 1 place
for more than 3-4 months

574
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,480
Wherever he was posted
encounter list is a mile long

575
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,160
To be honest he's a lunatic

576
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
Has the crime rate reduced?

577
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
Shaktivel
Asst Commissioner of Police

578
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,280
Special squad officer

579
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,600
All of you have to report to him

580
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,040
I didn't call you here
to ask your opinion

581
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,400
I called you to announce my decision

582
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,320
To handle some lunatics...

583
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,360
...we need some maniacs too!

584
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,400
- Kutty, not going to school?
- Exam today

585
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
- I'll see you
- Bye, dear

586
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,440
Ma, I'm going that way
Ask him if he needs a ride?

587
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,040
I can walk with my God-given legs!

588
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Tell me

589
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,840
- Where are you?
- Can't sleep if I don't tell?

590
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,640
Coming to Doveton Coffee shop?
Your girl is here

591
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,040
My girl is here too

592
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,840
I can't trick you at all, eh?

593
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,600
Caught you
Come and join us

594
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,560
'I look stylish, no?'

595
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,240
'Can I just wash my face?'

596
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,960
Why not refresh with acid?
You'll be gleaming!

597
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,400
- Your girl is inside
- I know

598
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,800
You wanted to ditch us, no?

599
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,240
Are we attending a funeral?

600
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,960
To go in a crowd?
Dumbass!

601
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Let's go

602
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,480
Where?

603
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,800
She called only me, if we all go,
she'll think we want freebies

604
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,160
- You think so even if she doesn't
- Why are you in a rush?

605
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,640
It's like our well water
Usable always

606
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,560
- Don't dip into the well next door
- I'll try

607
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,520
He is here also
knowing it's your birthday

608
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Such a fancy coffee shop
No electricity

609
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,120
That's cooling glass

610
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,760
I thought cooling glass
was only for faces!

611
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,360
Here

612
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,280
Why is the wrong bulb turned on?

613
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,640
We shouldn't go in with Sketch

614
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,240
We can go in as a customer

615
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,480
Let's go and see
what he is up to

616
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,800
'They are coming in'

617
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,920
I am so full

618
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,080
Look, he left

619
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,840
Tell me if my hair gets mussed

620
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,760
- Hold this
- Cake, huh?

621
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,680
- Shall I go wish?
- Your funeral!

622
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,240
Why curse me on a good day?

623
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,280
I told you that day, right?

624
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,680
That day means which day?

625
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,880
These girls can't be trusted

626
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,360
- What's wrong?
- No idea

627
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,400
They expect us to nod
like these dolls from Tanjore!

628
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,200
If you nod, clap or else slap

629
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,320
- What happened inside?
- Toe their line

630
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,360
She stamps cow dung
We should too!

631
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,520
Only then it's true love
Or else throw a tantrum

632
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,200
What happened inside?

633
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,280
If you ask a phone-kiss
she'll call you face to face

634
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,000
If you go, you're desperate
If not, you're pricey!

635
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,840
Why are you so hyper?

636
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,120
'If you had come in
I would have looked a fool'

637
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,560
What went wrong?

638
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,760
It hurts in here

639
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,640
Guna, if they eat Sketch for breakfast...

640
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,720
...if we get caught,
we'll be pounded to a paste!

641
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,040
Not 'we', speak for yourself!

642
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,760
- I have a girl
- She's Hulk, not a girl!

643
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,600
Got a matchbox?

644
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,360
- No
- No gas in my lighter

645
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,600
Get me a matchbox from inside

646
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,320
I kept it here
It's missing

647
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,440
- Where?
- Here

648
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,960
'Thank you, my mascot'

649
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,000
'- Done, huh?
- Joker!'

650
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,080
[popular song from '3']

651
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
- Isn't it simply soooper?
- You bet!

652
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,760
- Look how he's dancing
- Click on a fast beat song

653
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
Wait, I'll play it

654
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,960
Raise the volume

655
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,200
Gunaanna!
Hide it, quick

656
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,560
Switch it off

657
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
What are you up to?

658
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,120
- Nothing
- Simply, bro

659
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,280
I heard a song

660
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,640
- Nothing
- Answer me

661
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,600
- What is it?
- Phone, bro

662
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,440
Show it to me

663
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,800
Give it to me

664
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,240
Who bought it?

665
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,920
It belongs to us, bro

666
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,240
Looks brand new

667
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,600
How did you get the cash?

668
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,000
We traded the crap here
in a junk shop for money

669
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
How dare you!

670
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,760
Which is junk?

671
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,560
How can you decide
what's junk and what isn't?

672
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,960
I'll tell sait and chuck you out

673
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,440
- Bro, don't
- Please

674
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,640
Let go of my feet

675
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
- What, uncle?
- Chitti went to watch a film

676
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
'No sign of him at all'

677
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,880
It's raining plus thunder also

678
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,560
As usual must be in the theater

679
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,960
'Just go and check'

680
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,240
Royal pain!

681
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,840
Hello?

682
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,800
'Hello...stop the car'

683
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,440
I'm shouting
and you keep driving

684
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,240
Who are you, sir?

685
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,160
A plump fellow came here

686
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,080
Did you see him?
He didn't reach home

687
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,440
Check if he's the one
hiding in there?

688
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
There, huh?

689
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,200
Anjali baby is fast asleep!

690
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,080
- Anjali, get up
- Get up please

691
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,560
Aren't you a darling?

692
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,680
Wretched rain
Nonstop downpour

693
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,240
How much longer
will you hide like a kid?

694
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,520
My worry is mine!

695
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
Let's wait for the rain to stop

696
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,880
Come out
We are here

697
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,280
My mother has said the eldest son
should not watch lightning flash

698
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,000
That's when you were a kid

699
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,720
Grown up like a buffalo now

700
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,800
You might find it funny

701
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,200
I feel I'm seeing my mother

702
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,720
Come, I'm there for you

703
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,880
'I am trusting you'

704
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,760
Where was sir during Vardah cyclone?

705
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,640
'He shut himself in the loo'

706
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Split your mouth from ear to ear
If it rains scurry like a rat in fear

707
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,880
'Don't bring the umbrella
Lightning may strike it'

708
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,120
Sir?

709
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,240
Welcome, sir

710
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,520
Royapuram Kumar

711
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,080
You can even raze Royapuram

712
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,040
But Kumar can't be touched I heard

713
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,560
I'm least bit bothered
how you were before this

714
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,320
I must decide hereafter
how you should behave

715
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm not asking you to reform
At least act like you've changed

716
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,640
That's good for you

717
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,920
I think you would have understood

718
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,880
See you

719
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,720
'He has the gall to threaten us'

720
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,480
[indistinct whispers]

721
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,240
What are you looking at?
You bashed them coolly

722
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,120
So you're my bodyguard today

723
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,240
My blessed luck!

724
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,960
Don't cake up your face
with so much make up

725
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,160
- Hey!
- He's calling you

726
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,880
- What?
- Only 1 more stop, machan

727
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,720
Call me when you reach home

728
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
I'll see you

729
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,760
- Let's go
- 1 more stop

730
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,520
Sketch's girlfriend

731
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,400
- Why is he smiling at her?
- She's his girl

732
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,920
'Just watch me in action'

733
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,720
'She's gorgeous'

734
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,360
Scumbag!

735
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,840
Hey! Ammu

736
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,400
'I'll deal with you
Just you wait'

737
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,400
You came here too?
What's your problem?

738
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,200
You follow me in college
and come to my neighborhood

739
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
You wave at me in the bus stop

740
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,320
You behave like a rowdy hounding us

741
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,440
Thugs like you make my blood boil

742
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,680
Hey Ammu!
Poor thing

743
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,360
Let's get down
Move aside

744
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,480
I apologize on behalf of my friend

745
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,840
It's okay, sis

746
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Get down

747
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,320
Hey! Ammu

748
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,480
She doesn't love you?
Show off!

749
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,280
"In this diverse nation how much longer
will they deceive us, I wonder?"

750
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,360
What a situational song, bang on!

751
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
You seem to be in a good mood

752
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,040
Welcome to our party

753
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,360
I believe 'love blossomed'
in the bus with that Brahmin chick

754
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,040
But you fooled us totally
with your performance

755
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,560
- He's an Oscar winner!
- Count me out

756
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,480
Sketch, sit down, my dear friend

757
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,360
Bugging me! Any good news
I'll share for sure

758
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,040
- Nothing has bloomed
- It will blossom!

759
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,080
Nowadays girls prefer guys who 'get hit'
rather than the ones who hit!

760
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,000
They prefer the underdog
to the winning horse

761
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,160
Way off target
They like the doer

762
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,520
That was then!

763
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,200
Even girls take a shot

764
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,240
Bang on!

765
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
Voice of experience
as a married man

766
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,640
Go and apologize to her
and come without a 2nd glance

767
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,760
And then?

768
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,840
Don't be your stubborn self

769
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,080
- Just ask
- Please ask

770
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,120
He's the one

771
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,680
You created a scene in the bus
with some chick it seems

772
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,080
I didn't see it

773
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,440
- Show me now
- Is that so?

774
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,760
Come again

775
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,600
'Nowadays girls prefer guys who 'get hit'
rather than the ones who hit!'

776
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,320
You came to bash me up?

777
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,080
What are you waiting for?

778
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,560
- Go on
- He's giving permission

779
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,920
Why bring us over?
Go ahead and bash him

780
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,120
Did you hit me?

781
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,080
They are bashing him up
and you came away

782
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,520
He'll do some gimmick
all the time to impress you

783
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,480
'Wish he would impress me!'

784
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,160
- You know what he called me?
- What?

785
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,760
He called me 'sis'

786
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,960
From the beginning
he has been targeting you

787
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,960
Even yesterday they tried to
accost you, so he hit them

788
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,880
Loser!

789
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,480
Yesterday he looked like
he was born to be bashed up

790
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Now seeing me vault and flick
a cigarette with a lot of swag

791
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,400
...are you zapped?

792
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,360
That scene warranted a villain

793
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,040
When she saw you hitting me

794
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,600
I think I've become a hero

795
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Anyway tit for tat

796
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,960
Sir is busy!

797
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,400
You can attend to your work

798
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,280
Hey! Pittu
Smash him

799
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,560
"Etch a sketch"

800
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,520
"Plan a sketch"

801
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,400
If you can make me horizontal in 1 blow...

802
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,480
...try your luck

803
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,240
If you think you're here

804
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,560
So you might as well
get pounded to a pulp

805
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,560
Come on

806
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,680
Thrash him

807
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,160
In 1 strike

808
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,120
"Plan a sketch perfect"

809
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,880
"Implement it like a prefect"

810
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,320
Why does this happen only to me?

811
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,520
I was being bashed till now
and you didn't see that

812
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,480
Only when I am retaliating
you land up, bingo!

813
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,040
In the bus yesterday-

814
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,000
You don't know what happened
You think I'm the villain, correct?

815
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,000
You know my friends, morons

816
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,680
They instigated me and I feel...

817
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,840
...like some knife is piercing
my heart for the past 2 days

818
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,480
But it's very comforting

819
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,520
Like a bike left to rust for long
suddenly starting with just 1 kick?

820
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,440
Silly feelings

821
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,000
I'll erase all that

822
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,960
No need
What I did was-

823
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Sorry

824
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,960
I was waiting to apologize to you

825
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,600
These morons messed it up

826
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,040
You carry on

827
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,960
Get married and be happy

828
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,800
Have a brood of kids

829
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,840
"Thoughts of my heart's offspring
sear within me sadly scorching"

830
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,840
"In this world, only my days
dawns pitch dark always"

831
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,120
"Journey of our eyes abruptly ends
when we should be more than friends"

832
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,080
"Even after she stole my eyes
dreams continue to visualize"

833
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,800
"Can fields ever flower
if skies don't shower?"

834
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,040
"I am the fence here
for your garden, dear"

835
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,880
"Can flowers bloom in this garden
without rain from clouds laden?"

836
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,920
"I am the fence here
for the flowers in your garden, dear"

837
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,120
"For the job my eyes accomplished
love was the bonus I cherished"

838
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,120
"The way your eyes glanced
Silent language of love enhanced"

839
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,960
"The sun however fiery
can never dry up the sea"

840
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,360
"Even if lightning strikes suddenly
my sky won't break and fall on me"

841
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,280
"To speed breakers my road is oblivious"

842
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,680
"I don't know anything else to say obvious"

843
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,720
- What does your father do?
- Don't have parents

844
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,280
Sketch bro is paying
my fees, he's my idol

845
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,120
Here...your pen

846
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,400
'He is Sketch bro
who sponsors me'

847
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,200
- What?
- My hand's in a sling

848
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,800
Akka has come to be my scribe

849
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,880
See you, 'ka

850
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,840
- What brings you here?
- To study!

851
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,520
'Without a sling
as if you would have aced it'

852
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,720
You'll spend sait's money
on her travel, huh?

853
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,800
1 minute

854
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,640
Don't add all the good karma
into your account

855
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,800
Give me some

856
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,480
"Confined to 4 walls, I was just a bamboo
I turned into a flute with melodies anew"

857
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,280
"I was just a paper unfilled
I became a novel fulfilled"

858
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,440
"I was resigned to being lonely
Now I have a festive halo really"

859
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,320
"Far away as a star, I was a dot tiny
I became the silvery moon shiny"

860
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,760
"Won't your love's beauty
add to my longevity?"

861
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,880
"I bloom and blossom in your stalk
my tall and handsome hulk"

862
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,600
"My petals open out to you in rapturously"

863
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,920
"My body is as sweet as honey wondrously"

864
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,600
'Take your hands off him'

865
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,400
- Should I be quiet?
- Get out

866
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,240
He is already bashed up
Poor boy! Don't hit him

867
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,120
- I was insulted because of him
- David, take him away

868
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,000
He is a pipsqueak

869
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,360
So what? He'll keep getting
bashed up by Sketch

870
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,840
'Rowdy to the core
he has insulted my brother'

871
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,120
I must teach him a lesson

872
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,960
I'm waiting for the right chance

873
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,920
'If Sketch sketches a plan
the sketch won't go amiss'

874
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,720
'Only if it misses
let me know'

875
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,440
I'll finish it without a hitch

876
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,680
Let's run...hurry

877
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,880
- What, Sillu?
- Sait

878
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,400
Looks like you will
climb up the ladder soon

879
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,360
- Seizing vehicles, huh?
- Give me a job, sait

880
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,120
I'll finish it without a hitch

881
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,360
Clear out!

882
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,920
No hitch it seems!

883
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,680
Sait, if these boys usurp my place
I have to water camels in Rajasthan!

884
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,600
I feel sad they never went to school
Look at them vegetating!

885
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,680
Sketch, forget them now

886
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,680
Why I wanted to meet you was-

887
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,440
I came because MLA called me

888
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,680
I don't know how
you'll deal with this

889
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,240
If Siva had been alive
he would've aced it

890
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,160
Siva was Kumar's henchman

891
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,480
I don't know all that

892
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,600
He will do a good job

893
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,120
Don't judge Royapuram Kumar
by the fancy facade of his house

894
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,760
His backyard is a dumpyard

895
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,640
Want to watch my true colors?

896
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,360
You misunderstood me
As long as you finish the job, fine

897
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,080
You'll get what's due to you

898
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,280
Why is he harping on money?

899
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,640
Tell him to part with a share

900
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,720
Share?

901
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,680
I've never paid anyone
a share till now

902
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,760
You can't over ride me

903
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,240
I won't let you either

904
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,480
- You have no choice
- You got me into such a fix?

905
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,920
You've entrusted the job to Kumar
Just relax and watch

906
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,200
I'll see you

907
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,440
Let me see how you fare

908
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,400
'He braked all of a sudden'

909
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,160
- How dare you retort!
- Who will pacify my boss?

910
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,880
'Creating a jam
1st clear out'

911
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,240
No, sir, not unless he pays

912
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,680
I can't pay him, sir

913
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,640
Hello?

914
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,680
Clear up, don't we have to go home?

915
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,760
Will you be quiet
if it happened to you?

916
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,960
- Pay up, I say
- I'll pay, start your car

917
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,360
Will you talk to my boss?

918
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,240
- Move aside
- You move

919
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,800
Clear out...make way

920
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,400
'Don't crowd around'

921
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,800
'Where's the bike?'

922
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,360
'Move...don't hang around'

923
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,920
Sait, I promised to clear
all my dues within 2 days, right?

924
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,760
How many times will I call you?

925
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,360
Haven't you seized my bike?

926
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,120
I've got the cash with me
Show me the bike

927
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,920
Hey! Give me the cash

928
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,520
Here's your money

929
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,720
- Bhaskar
- What, sait?

930
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,880
Call Sketch

931
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,400
'He isn't picking'

932
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,720
'- Sillu?
- Yes, Sait'

933
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,480
- Order tea for all
- Okay, sait

934
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,600
Don't cover up with tea
and bun, show my bike

935
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,960
'Sait, why is Sketch coming in an auto?'

936
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,040
Where's the bike?

937
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,600
Minor accident near Chetpet

938
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,920
A crowd gathered

939
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,560
I got down to check
and someone stole the bike

940
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,480
Someone stole my bike?!

941
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,720
Where did you sell the spare parts?

942
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,880
Lower your tone

943
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,200
You have the gall to steal
my bike and ask me to shut up!

944
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,520
Listen, sait, don't have
such losers handling my-

945
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,240
This is bound to be the outcome

946
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,840
I want my bike back

947
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,840
Or things will take an ugly turn

948
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,320
What will you do, huh?

949
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,400
Call Ravi here

950
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,160
Er...no, no need Ravi

951
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,320
Call Sekar from Perambur

952
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,920
Call all our boys from Puliyanthope

953
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,120
All our cubs

954
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,480
Sait, we will do or die today

955
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,640
By all means most welcome

956
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,960
Hey! Sketch

957
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,680
Someone is coming it seems

958
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,840
Go down

959
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,240
Clear out now

960
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,880
What do you want now?

961
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,840
Give me 0.2 million

962
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,480
I'll leave you in peace then

963
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,760
Are you happy now?

964
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,640
You should bring the bike
straight to the garage

965
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,800
Why hang around and
gawk at everything?

966
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,720
Go easy on your words, sait

967
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,080
What do you mean?
200000, mind it!

968
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,720
Does money grow on trees?

969
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,040
Gain is thanks to you
Loss is also because of you

970
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,200
'Call Ravi here'

971
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,920
Why are you laughing, Sketch?

972
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,160
Only after his bike was stolen
he has come here!

973
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,640
Are you serious?

974
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,520
By tonight, the bike and cash

975
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,560
...will be here!

976
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,800
Ravi, Sketch isn't a much of a bigwig

977
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,720
You asked me to steal the car
and ensured I got paid

978
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,000
'You are awesome'

979
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,400
You would have seen Sketch win

980
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,720
Not seen him lose, right?

981
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,880
I witnessed it

982
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,000
Why didn't you click a photo?
I would have also seen

983
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,880
'But I have come in person!'

984
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,680
"Etch a sketch"

985
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,800
How did he land up here?

986
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,400
Did you think I won't come?

987
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,240
Or...you thought I cannot come?

988
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,000
"Plan a sketch precise"

989
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,880
"Keep it simple and concise"

990
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,480
"Plan a sketch incomparable"

991
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,320
"With no loopholes; do-able"

992
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,080
"Plan it with originality
Bullets from a gun swiftly"

993
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,600
"Aim at the foe, brave
Send him to his grave"

994
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,040
"Design it deadly, deftly
Bullets from a gun swiftly"

995
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,920
"Aim and stab with the knife
That's the end of his earthly life"

996
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,880
"Plan a sketch without any strife"

997
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,600
Anyone can sketch a plan

998
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,040
But if you sketch a plan for Sketch
how can you win?

999
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,440
You'll be healthy if you eat
only from your plate

1000
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,560
But if you eat from another
man's plate, it's leftover-

1001
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,920
I don't think I have to repeat

1002
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,400
See you?

1003
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,440
"Plan a sketch to a T"

1004
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,680
Sait, you spilt words
you can't take back

1005
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,640
'If Sketch sketches a plan
the sketch won't go amiss'

1006
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
Take it

1007
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,760
I know that

1008
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
Then why did you
let your tongue run?

1009
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,080
Care for a drink?

1010
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,240
Okay

1011
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,720
How is it, Sketch?

1012
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,400
Whatever it is

1013
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,320
...you shouldn't have derided me

1014
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,080
'Gain is thanks to you
Loss is also because of you'

1015
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,480
Don't keep rubbing salt
on to the wound

1016
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,400
Shall I tell you something?

1017
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,360
Everyone cannot win
always in all ways

1018
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,640
In this world, in some situation
at some time or the other, one has to lose

1019
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,240
Has the plan I sketched
ever gone amiss?

1020
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,600
That isn't the point

1021
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,800
When my father was in this business
Royapuram Kumar bought a car on EMI

1022
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,640
He threatened the man
who went to collect his EMI

1023
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,400
My father got so wild, he grabbed
his shirt in the middle of the road

1024
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,480
He hit my father
in that very spot violently

1025
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,000
My father was so humiliated he died

1026
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,280
Then doesn't it mean we lost?

1027
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,800
You wouldn't have lost
if I had been with you

1028
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,880
Even then we would have lost

1029
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,920
Shall I seize his car?

1030
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,560
You enjoy your drink

1031
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,320
Just tell me, sait
Shall I?

1032
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,520
Aiyo! I am not-

1033
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,400
Shall I seize that car for you?

1034
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,280
Sketch, I am drunk
and blabbering, you go

1035
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,440
'Sait...don't think I am
challenging in a drunken stupor'

1036
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,720
'Tell me'

1037
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,280
Shall I seize it?

1038
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,320
Shall I bring that car
to your doorstep?

1039
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,000
- Tell me
- You won't listen to me

1040
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,400
Alright

1041
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,000
You don't have to collect dues
after seizing his car

1042
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,320
To prove you have his car

1043
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,680
Just send me a selfie

1044
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,440
I shall gift you a chain
of 10 sovereigns of gold

1045
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,760
But it isn't as easy as you think

1046
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,280
You keep your chain ready

1047
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,920
I'll show you I mean business

1048
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,920
According to the tip off I got
Kumar is smuggling drugs to Tada

1049
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,680
He has 5 centers of activity

1050
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,880
'Fish market'

1051
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,080
'His house'

1052
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,640
'Flower stall'

1053
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,920
Mall and the 5th is-

1054
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,560
Sir, ice factory

1055
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,640
Ice factory

1056
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,120
That can't be seized on the way

1057
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,040
If no petrol it can run
alternatively on gas

1058
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,840
If you think of a puncture
the tyre is tubeless

1059
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,480
Only Kumar has the car keys

1060
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,600
'With a tiny remote sensor'

1061
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,400
Even if anyone goes
anywhere near his car-

1062
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,400
Check who is near my car

1063
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,360
If he isn't in it, can't even seize
the car, let alone go near it

1064
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,720
Then how will you steal it?

1065
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,120
No pain, no gain

1066
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,360
If our job was easy, you won't
need Sketch to sketch your plan

1067
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,720
One of us should be near Kumar

1068
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,720
Bro, you were looking for a cook?

1069
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,160
Good afternoon, sir

1070
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,040
His vehicles have left all 5 places

1071
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,920
'Our men are following all the cars'

1072
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,520
'Regular vehicle, sir'

1073
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,280
'We'll be the judge of that'

1074
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
'Get down!'

1075
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,280
[overlap of voices]

1076
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,080
'Why aren't you picking my call, sir?'

1077
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,680
I'll call you back

1078
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,360
Tell me, sir
Who is smuggling the drugs?

1079
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,240
- Me
- What?

1080
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,160
That's why I brought you here

1081
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,800
I have brought the stuff
over here a week ago

1082
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,960
'A little while ago it was
transferred to my car'

1083
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
'But the Asst Commissioner of police
made my job simpler'

1084
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,840
'I registered in his mind that our stuff
is being smuggled from 5 places'

1085
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,760
Hospital is the perfect spot

1086
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,560
- What?
- We'll seize his car

1087
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,160
- Chitti surveyed the area
- Hospital has tight security

1088
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,440
I am not transferring the goods in Tada

1089
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,040
But in our wine shop in Guindy

1090
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,000
We'll take the car when he is in it

1091
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,920
You're asking the free hen to
come and fall into your cooker

1092
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,040
Yes

1093
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,480
'Look here'

1094
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,920
He has to take the main road
if he's coming from Zam bazar

1095
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,800
So that isn't the right spot

1096
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,600
'There's a street
parallel to the main road'

1097
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,760
We should somehow bring his car here

1098
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,920
It should block the main road

1099
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,160
That's your job

1100
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,840
'Men at work'

1101
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,080
'He has started, come'

1102
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,400
'Move...move'

1103
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,200
'In this street, he can
either go forward or reverse'

1104
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,760
But he can't reverse because Guna and I
will be following him closely in this car

1105
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,760
Bhaskar, your job

1106
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,280
'You'll be in this narrow street'

1107
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,680
'At the right time
you'll block him here'

1108
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,200
'After that'

1109
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,000
Hey! Reverse, I say

1110
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,120
Hello, brother?

1111
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,600
How long do I wait?

1112
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,320
Why are you impatient, huh?
Can't you see this car?

1113
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,120
He seems to be drunk as a skunk!

1114
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,000
Hey! Move your damn car

1115
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,440
We have our own deadlines

1116
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,520
2 minutes, sir

1117
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,480
I have work to do
Move now

1118
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,440
Our words are falling on deaf ears

1119
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,920
'He thinks it's his parking lot or what?
Drunken driving, huh?'

1120
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,160
- Yov! Move it
- Yes, sir, now, sir

1121
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,640
'I'm going...going...gone'

1122
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,360
Hey! Wait, I say

1123
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,560
Hey! Wait

1124
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,280
Such a pain!

1125
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,360
- What, man?
- I'm a mechanic, sir

1126
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,320
'Why do you get tense?
Get down'

1127
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,400
Hey! Hey...my car!

1128
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,240
- Yes, bro
- Hey! Murthy

1129
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,560
- Someone seized my car
- What do you mean?

1130
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,240
He shouldn't cross Zam bazar

1131
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,680
He's in 1st street

1132
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,280
Wait there
I'll bring the boys

1133
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,160
- Tell me
- We checked all the check-posts

1134
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
- Found nothing
- I have a doubt, sir

1135
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,280
Has Kumar diverted us
and taken another route?

1136
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,880
Do you think he has cancelled his plan?

1137
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,800
Why do you think
I am not as perturbed as you?

1138
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,880
I don't know, sir

1139
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,080
I know where the stuff is

1140
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,920
What do you mean, sir?

1141
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,840
When he has a spy here
won't 1 of our boys be in his camp?

1142
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,600
- Ashok?
- Yes, sir

1143
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,040
- Switch on the GPS
- Okay, sir

1144
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,320
'GPS?'

1145
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,480
The stuff is wherever Kumar is

1146
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,760
'Subramani, where are you?'

1147
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,960
'TCX 9848'

1148
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,160
Red Fiat

1149
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,520
The car passed us and is
heading towards the beach

1150
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,480
Subramani, chase that car

1151
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,320
Mani, can you hear me?

1152
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,320
'TCX 9848, red Fiat
cruising in Triplicane area'

1153
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,400
Block with a barricade, over

1154
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,960
Hey! You go that side

1155
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,680
Why has the car stopped?

1156
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,200
- Sait
- Tell me, Sketch

1157
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,880
Check your WhatsApp

1158
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,080
- Sketch!
- We did it, right?

1159
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,400
The cops are chasing me on one side

1160
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,160
Kumar's boys are on the other side

1161
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,080
Bring this car's seizing letter
to R2 police station

1162
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,440
I'll come immediately

1163
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,200
Sir, the car is coming into our area

1164
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,080
Our area?

1165
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,440
Sir, it is heading towards our station

1166
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,960
'Sir, it is now turning
into our compound!'

1167
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,080
Kavi

1168
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,120
Smuggling drugs?

1169
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,920
- Will you take your hand off?
- He's messing with a cop!

1170
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,720
Hey! Sketch

1171
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,440
'1 minute, ACP sir'

1172
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,080
I said 'take your hands off'

1173
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,400
This car belongs to him

1174
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,920
I work for him

1175
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,560
- The due hasn't been paid
- Kavi, open the boot

1176
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,320
'Drugs, sir'

1177
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,240
Your job is to find drugs
Mine is only to seize the car

1178
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,480
I've done my job

1179
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,880
'You can attend to yours'

1180
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,880
Sait, give the seizing letter
or else ACP will be hopping mad!

1181
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,720
- Superb, Sketch
- Sooper timing

1182
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,920
Go in and sign

1183
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,040
'I'm a mechanic, sir'

1184
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,200
ACP sir, how are you?

1185
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,080
Like in the movies you'll say...

1186
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,600
'I am innocent
My driver did it'

1187
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,440
'ACP sir is bang on'

1188
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,880
How can you malign him?

1189
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Sir, unload the stuff
and release my car

1190
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,760
- I'm late
- I can't, sir

1191
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,640
I can't return the car
till the case is closed

1192
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,880
See you in court

1193
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,120
Kavi, confiscate his car

1194
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,800
Hey! Careful of my-

1195
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,560
Just the indicator
Can change it

1196
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,680
Kavi, drive the car to the go-down

1197
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,280
'On your way out, file
a complaint on your driver'

1198
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,920
- You said I can't
- You can and you did it!

1199
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,040
'If Sketch sketches a plan
the sketch won't go amiss'

1200
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,720
'Only if it misses let me know
I'll finish it without any knots'

1201
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,080
Sait is the main culprit?

1202
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,680
He isn't that gutsy!

1203
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,480
'Ask him to reward you heavily!'

1204
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,480
The four of them
are the spunky ones

1205
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,640
'We thought we won that day'

1206
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,360
'We didn't know then'

1207
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,600
'Our problems started on that day!'

1208
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,120
'We thought we won that day'

1209
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,240
'We didn't know then'

1210
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,160
'Our problems started on that day!'

1211
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,240
Sir, you claimed you have
seized the drugs

1212
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,880
- When will you arrest the culprit?
- Very soon

1213
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:24,640
You know the car belongs to Kumar
When do you plan to arrest him?

1214
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,360
Isn't that why I am here?

1215
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,480
That day will dawn very soon

1216
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,760
I'll arrest him

1217
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,560
'He seems to have got some award!'

1218
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,960
Your TV is blaring
right up to the street

1219
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,760
You weren't adept at finishing
the assigned job, happily watching TV

1220
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,920
Siva would have aced this

1221
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,200
Wretched fellow died

1222
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,760
It isn't important whom he worked for
But how adept he is at his job

1223
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,280
If I hear 1 more word from him

1224
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,680
...there will be no trace
of his presence here

1225
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,800
If I ask you to pay up
you will kill me, huh?

1226
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,360
First ask him to leave

1227
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,200
Tell him, before he steps out
money will be deposited in his account

1228
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,560
Why the hell didn't you
tell me this earlier?

1229
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,240
Those 4 are to blame
for all this disgrace

1230
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,880
We must teach them a lesson

1231
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,200
Already that ACP is like a scenthound

1232
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,520
Calm down, sir

1233
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,960
I am not a fool

1234
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,880
I know you are extremely intelligent

1235
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,160
'Do as you please'

1236
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,880
Shall we turn a blind eye?

1237
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,880
I'm not a politician to strike later

1238
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,840
All 4 should die

1239
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,440
Without knowing who killed them

1240
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,160
Bring down goons from out of town

1241
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,560
Let them stay elsewhere

1242
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,040
I must only hear the explosion
in which all 4 died

1243
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,600
You beat your own record

1244
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,880
- Sketch
- 1 minute

1245
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,000
This should be-

1246
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,280
I don't want

1247
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,440
Listen to me
You deserve it

1248
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,040
Hello

1249
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,520
I'm Ammu here

1250
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,720
I can hear you, go on

1251
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,680
I am in Mylapore
Can you come over?

1252
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,440
- I'll come
- I'll text you my address

1253
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
No need

1254
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,840
What a surprise visit!

1255
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,400
I just dropped by

1256
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,360
Come in

1257
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,440
- Sit down
- Sit by my side

1258
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,400
Hi

1259
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,000
Aunty, you came home
Met me as a bride for your son

1260
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,320
You said, 'I like you very much
You're my daughter-in-law'

1261
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,280
I'm really very happy, aunty

1262
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,600
Karthik is also good

1263
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,320
Smart, brilliant, intelligent

1264
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,400
'Awesome'

1265
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,760
I have a special dream
from my childhood

1266
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,280
About the man I will marry

1267
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,080
Bearded like this

1268
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,160
Shirt unbuttoned

1269
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,200
Like this

1270
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,200
Then he should be
slightly rugged looking

1271
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,200
Tough nut to crack, but inside
soft as a marshmallow

1272
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,800
For example

1273
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,120
Like a jackfruit

1274
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,960
Prickly on the surface

1275
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,840
But the fruit inside is soft

1276
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,040
And sweet

1277
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,240
Like that, aunty

1278
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,640
Instead of comparing
you might as well marry him

1279
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,400
Correct

1280
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,640
'You have understood but-'

1281
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,440
I think aunty hasn't understood

1282
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,040
Of course I do, dear

1283
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,680
'It is clear as crystal'

1284
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:45,920
"You devoured the air around me
My sophisticated sweetheart missy"

1285
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,720
"You made me breathless, honey
with your eyes like a honey bee"

1286
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:57,520
"You devoured the air around me
My sophisticated sweet missy"

1287
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:03,240
"You made me gasp, breathless
with your honey bee eyes, my princess"

1288
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,480
"I became a hollow to hold
your kisses multifold"

1289
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,520
"I reduced my height
to admire your waist so white"

1290
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:14,560
"In the shower of your words true blue
I turned into a love-deluge, Ammu"

1291
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
"I stored the beauty of girls plenty
in a special place as bounty"

1292
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,960
"They can't hold a candle, see
to your ethereal beauty"

1293
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:32,000
"Take my magic buds as your treasure"

1294
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:37,480
"Hide them in your beard to savor"

1295
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:43,560
"Feature in my dream whenever I ask you"

1296
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:49,240
"Gift your macho scent to me, my beau"

1297
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:55,000
"You devoured the air around me
My sophisticated sweet missy"

1298
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,640
"You made me breathless, honey
with your eyes like a honey bee"

1299
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:54,000
"Pollen grains shower on me
Drenching my DNA soulfully"

1300
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,440
"My heartbeats tattoo in his journey
like melody in rhythmic rhapsody"

1301
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:05,160
"In your love's shadow I'll rest happily
Throughout my lifetime heartily"

1302
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:10,640
"In my daily calendar you'll be
refreshing shower of rain, my lady"

1303
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:17,400
"Come and live with me for eternity"

1304
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:23,360
"Anchor our love, conquer my femininity"

1305
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:29,360
"Shall I conquer the femininity
you offer willingly to me?"

1306
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,960
"Come, merge with me
Let you and me emerge as we"

1307
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,120
Sundaram, you wanted to
tell me something important

1308
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,600
'Where is my son-in-law to-be?'

1309
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,800
I wanted to tell you

1310
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,920
My son got a job in Dubai
and left all of a sudden

1311
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,160
What do you mean?

1312
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,000
Think of it as God's will

1313
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,920
My older son is yet
to be married, right?

1314
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,560
Let your daughter marry him instead

1315
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,800
'Even he doesn't know'

1316
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,120
'I thought I'll tell you first'

1317
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,400
1 minute, dear
Come inside

1318
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,480
What, my dear?

1319
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,160
I didn't agree to this just because
he is your friend's son

1320
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,600
I accepted because
we are both educated

1321
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,880
If you feel awkward
I can tell him myself

1322
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,920
That is-

1323
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,120
The point is-

1324
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,400
Doesn't matter

1325
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,720
Uncle, I need to talk to Gayatri

1326
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,880
Hi Jeeva
How are you?

1327
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,680
Don't get me wrong

1328
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,440
I have dreamt of how exactly
my husband should be

1329
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,680
He should work
in a software company

1330
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,920
Clean shaven
Professional look

1331
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,640
Our children should
study in a convent

1332
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,360
I have so many requisites like this

1333
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,960
I can't let go of my dreams

1334
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,960
I'll pray to God
specially for you

1335
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,440
You should be blessed
with a beautiful girl

1336
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,520
Doesn't matter

1337
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,320
You made it easy, I was
wondering how to turn you down

1338
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,840
You don't have to pray for me
God has already blessed me

1339
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,600
You haven't seen my girl, right?

1340
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,600
Tell me the truth, is she
more beautiful than you or not?

1341
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,440
You are angry now which means
she is more beautiful than you!

1342
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,360
Thanks

1343
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:13,800
Hello

1344
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,960
How many times to tell you?
Will be delivered by 2:00 p.m

1345
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,680
I don't have any driver here

1346
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,400
Okay, I'll find someone

1347
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,080
'What's up, sait?'

1348
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,400
Deliver the black Ford 9997
parked outside

1349
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,720
Let Bhaskar come
We'll go together

1350
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,280
He's in a tearing hurry, da

1351
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,440
Is it an ambulance to be in a hurry?

1352
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,720
He's a good client
with a big bank account

1353
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,360
Go with a smile

1354
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,680
Cover up everyone with cash, sait

1355
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,120
I'll meet your deadline!

1356
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,200
Mr Narain Karthik, where
are you off to so urgently?

1357
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,480
You think you're a racer!
Showing off

1358
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,640
Sacred ash on forehead
Didn't shower, can't I find out?

1359
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,680
[humming a song from
'Pattikada Pattanama']

1360
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,960
He just left in that car

1361
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,080
Bro, chapter closed
for 1 out of 4

1362
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,120
'Did you check properly?'

1363
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,880
What is it, Kavi?

1364
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,280
The container somehow got unlocked
and fell down from that crane

1365
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,600
The boy died on the spot, sir

1366
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,280
- Where's the operator?
- He ran away in panic, sir

1367
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,440
That building has a camera, right?

1368
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,280
I got it, sir

1369
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,640
I want that footage

1370
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,040
'He is crying, machan'

1371
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,320
Find another stick

1372
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,760
Hey! Your uncle

1373
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,640
Cover on top with-

1374
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,600
Chitti is looking at us

1375
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,280
'I feel I'm seeing my mother
if I hear a loud clap of thunder'

1376
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,920
'I don't step out if it rains'

1377
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,840
'I am terrified of rain'

1378
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,400
'Give me the last shot'

1379
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,240
'No one is picking my call'

1380
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,680
'Who will do all this work?'

1381
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,880
Where the hell are you?

1382
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,120
- What is it, sait?
- 'Everything is at a standstill'

1383
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,160
Even I am upset by Chitti's sudden demise

1384
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,840
'We have to move on'

1385
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,520
1st all of you come to my garage

1386
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,560
I am consoling Sketch
We'll come in a day or two

1387
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,360
Valli has been coming here
asking for you

1388
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,520
Call her

1389
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,960
I'll talk to her
No issues

1390
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,880
The groom looks so smart

1391
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,520
- Get coffee for them
- Okay, ma

1392
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,280
The groom looks like
Amul baby, soft and cuddly

1393
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,760
Come and serve coffee

1394
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,560
Your mother is comparing him
to Arvind Swami in 'Roja'

1395
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,120
My mother is living with my father
thinking he is Kamal Haasan!

1396
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,920
Come, dear

1397
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,440
1st serve the elders

1398
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,120
I like her, ma

1399
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,560
The groom has agreed

1400
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,800
Let's proceed?

1401
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,280
We can check for an auspicious date

1402
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,560
And finalize

1403
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,160
- I am going
- Where?

1404
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,480
The groom I intend marrying has come

1405
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,120
'I'll talk to him and be back'

1406
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,880
'You keep talking'

1407
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,200
- Ammu
- Akka

1408
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,280
Where is she going?

1409
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,120
We assumed it was a decent family!

1410
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,400
- Does your uncle know?
- No

1411
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,520
Amma...amma

1412
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,840
Akka has come

1413
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,920
Who is this chap?

1414
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,000
Ammu, what's wrong with you?

1415
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,560
Ask her to come in first

1416
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,600
Come in

1417
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,600
1 minute

1418
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,800
You can fix the wedding date
whenever you like

1419
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,160
But it's such a waste to spend money
on wedding preparations

1420
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,720
Whenever you fix the date,
this is what I'll do

1421
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:35,720
I'll kidnap her

1422
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,280
My words won't sink in

1423
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,920
So I showed it in action

1424
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,440
I decide who will be
my son-in-law

1425
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,280
He has to be a Brahmin

1426
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,640
I don't know about
your clan or mine

1427
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,040
She is my girl

1428
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,160
Kavi, what happened
to the CCTV footage?

1429
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,320
Sir, an army officer lives there
He's out of the country on vacation

1430
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,880
He'll be back only after 10-15 days

1431
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,600
'Why is it crowded?'

1432
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,400
Kavi, pull up near that shop

1433
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,080
- Who are you?
- We've come to attend a wedding

1434
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,520
Whose wedding?
From where?

1435
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,960
- Bangalore
- Chidambaram

1436
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,120
You say Bangalore
He says Chidambaram

1437
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,320
I'm from Chidambaram
He has come from Bangalore

1438
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,480
We are staying closeby
in Lotus lodge

1439
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,320
- Don't hang around here
- Okay, sir

1440
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,720
He and his crook of a face!

1441
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,960
Tell me, Manju darling

1442
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,560
Would you like me to
make 'sambar' or 'rasam'?

1443
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,600
You cook, dear
I'll come and name it

1444
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,520
Quiet Mischief you are!

1445
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,680
Thinks she is Master Chef winner!

1446
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,560
Hi Sketch

1447
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,560
You seem to have zeroed in on me

1448
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,800
It seems you have a ladies' 2 wheeler

1449
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,320
No, I don't have

1450
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,200
- I met your father-in-law
- He snitched, huh?

1451
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,600
Must rip the lips
of that motor mouth!

1452
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,800
Fascino, your favorite 2 wheeler

1453
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,640
Hello, happy birthday

1454
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,960
Thank you

1455
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,240
What's news?

1456
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,560
True friend, eh?

1457
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,960
Some people stick like glue

1458
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,480
She's giving us so much privacy!

1459
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,880
See you

1460
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,120
Bye

1461
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,520
Sorry

1462
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,720
I came 5 minutes ahead of time!

1463
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,120
- Mad at me?
- Nothing of that sort

1464
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,920
Even if I was mad, you've brought
my favorite vehicle

1465
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,840
'I'll adjust, don't worry'

1466
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,560
- Finally alone!
- Where's my gift?

1467
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,480
I'll take you for a ride
Full day in that Fascino

1468
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,160
101% useless!

1469
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,120
I knew you wouldn't have
got anything for me, but-

1470
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,840
'I've got a return gift for you'

1471
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,040
Have you ever seen
a watch on my wrist?

1472
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,800
That's why I chose this

1473
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,560
'Don't use it 24x7'

1474
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,480
Whenever you miss me
wear it to think of me

1475
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,240
- 1 more rule?
- Has a special feature

1476
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,840
It shows you the time?!

1477
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,080
Joke, huh?

1478
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,440
- 'Does it work?'
- No

1479
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,240
Gifting me a run-down watch

1480
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,240
'It works now'

1481
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,000
'Hey! Stopped now'

1482
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,760
- Then?
- It has a sensor inside

1483
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,320
It runs based on your pulse

1484
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,000
Is that so?

1485
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,040
You like it?

1486
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,520
Very much

1487
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,640
Do you like me very much?

1488
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,960
The extent of my love for you

1489
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,840
I want to live with you
and demonstrate

1490
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,440
A cute life

1491
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,600
With a 'little prince' like you!

1492
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,920
"My fair lady beautiful"

1493
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,240
For a boy like me
to find a girl like you

1494
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,200
Herculean task it will be

1495
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,160
"My life's light meaningful"

1496
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,000
"My wife-to-be wonderful"

1497
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,720
"My sweetheart sinful"

1498
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,480
"My princess playful"

1499
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,320
"My beloved blissful"

1500
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,280
"My bearded lover, one and only"

1501
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,160
"I'll search and kiss your face gladly"

1502
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,000
"I'll weave many a meaning
Don't chew me, darling"

1503
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:02,440
"More than you'll ever do
I'll try to get real close to you"

1504
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,920
"Without letting you know, I'll enter
Fuse with your cells and senses favor"

1505
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,040
"To rejoice with you forever welcome
a million nights I'll gather, come"

1506
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,520
"Walk my journey
My life's destiny"

1507
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,920
"My lucky mascot plentiful"

1508
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,840
"My heartthrob thoughtful"

1509
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,360
"My fair lady beautiful"

1510
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,520
"My golden angel graceful"

1511
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,840
Think you can catch me

1512
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,040
You'll get caught one day!

1513
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,760
Hope you have your license with you

1514
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,600
I do, but do you have the book?

1515
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,080
'Kumudam' or 'Vikatan'?

1516
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,040
Stop...stop

1517
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,760
- I told you to stop
- Yov! Oldie

1518
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,040
Come and see my boss

1519
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,040
1 minute, wait

1520
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,040
Won't she fall down
if he grabs the key like that?

1521
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,960
All that's fine
Get me the RC book

1522
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,320
'Give me the keys'

1523
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,560
I want your papers

1524
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,120
I can open only with the key

1525
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,400
Take it

1526
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,400
- 'Take it out'
- Wait for a while

1527
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,720
'Where is your RC book?'

1528
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,880
'Give me the key'

1529
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,440
'Get lost'

1530
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,600
- Yes, Sketch?
- Mari

1531
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,880
The cops stopped me
Where's the RC book?

1532
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,280
I've never set my eyes on that crap

1533
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,480
- Whaaat?
- No emotion, just escape

1534
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,760
You can say that so cool-

1535
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,720
'Don't snitch to the police'

1536
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,000
Won't you put it back
after the water-wash?

1537
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,880
Gulp it down raw

1538
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,960
Junk fellow!

1539
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,880
Sorry sir

1540
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,760
He left the book at home

1541
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,160
Are you playing the fool?

1542
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,480
You aren't even Traffic police
Why are you stopping us?

1543
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,280
We get pulled up
by goons who steal at night

1544
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,800
Do we look like car thieves to you?

1545
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,080
Drop in at the station nearby
and talk to my boss

1546
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,880
Velu, take the vehicle
to the station

1547
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,280
What is it?

1548
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,840
She's saying only Traffic department
should ask her for the papers

1549
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,080
You can go
Take a seat

1550
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,720
Only the police will ask,
who else will?

1551
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,640
Actually he left
the papers at home, sir

1552
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,760
It's just missing paper for you

1553
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,160
For us, paper absent means
it's a stolen vehicle

1554
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,360
Does he look like a thief to you?

1555
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,360
You are putting me in a spot

1556
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,800
Get the chassis # of their vehicle

1557
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,760
Sign here saying you'll bring
the RC book tomorrow

1558
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,520
'Okay, go'

1559
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,280
Hello, I'm in a police station

1560
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,480
Can I call you back in a while?

1561
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,160
'Talk properly into the phone'

1562
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,040
Sorry

1563
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,160
I called you

1564
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,840
He stole your vehicle
and took you for a ride!

1565
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,680
And made you say
it's his vehicle!

1566
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,960
Boss, you are too good!

1567
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,920
My scooty is yellow

1568
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,440
Give me a moment

1569
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,840
A vehicle's number and
color can be changed

1570
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,960
But the chassis # remains the same

1571
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,080
Maaari!

1572
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,000
You are Amudhavalli, right?

1573
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,000
Mari is-

1574
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,520
You said you seize
only vehicles with EMI pending

1575
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,000
You also steal, huh?

1576
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,240
- You know Mari
- Give me the keys, sir

1577
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,840
He seized that vehicle to-

1578
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,400
Please don't talk to me

1579
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,240
How can you get upset for such-

1580
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,480
My dear man, wait

1581
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,040
Sit down, she is justified
in getting angry

1582
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,920
If I file a case
you go in

1583
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,200
What shall we do?

1584
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,560
I'm not bragging

1585
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,400
I believe people are saying
she and I are made for each other

1586
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,520
I'll dump you and zoom away
Will you shut up?

1587
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,080
You are green with jealousy

1588
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,640
Don't be long
Only 5 minutes

1589
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,440
Give me 10 minutes, Sketch

1590
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,200
What will you do in 10 minutes?

1591
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,520
Sky is the limit

1592
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,800
May end up in a delivery
in 10 months, go slow

1593
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,960
Tell me

1594
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,400
You won't call me
if I don't, huh?

1595
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,120
'How can she ditch me?'

1596
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,880
Yes, Guna

1597
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,280
- Where are you?
- At home

1598
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,280
Valli messaged me asking me
to meet her at 10:00 p.m

1599
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,720
I am here, but why is
her mobile switched off?

1600
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,960
Valli lost her phone
How can she text you?

1601
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,800
- Didn't she tell you?
- Is that so?

1602
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,760
I'll go and ask her to meet you

1603
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,200
I'm in the ground behind her house

1604
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,440
Ask her to come soon

1605
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,240
'Do you know why I yelled at you?'

1606
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,480
Only because I did
the cop didn't ask me for money

1607
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,600
- Can I talk later?
- Mad at me?

1608
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,200
Did not take money it seems!

1609
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,360
'GUNAAAA!'

1610
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,520
Anna...!

1611
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,680
Why did you come here?

1612
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,560
You'll be fine

1613
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,760
Don't be scared, okay?

1614
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,880
There were 2 witnesses at the spot

1615
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,600
One is that girl

1616
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,000
His girlfriend

1617
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,720
I've enquired thoroughly

1618
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,320
She doesn't know anything

1619
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,440
The other is his friend, sir

1620
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,600
He says all the faces were
masked with a kerchief

1621
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,760
- 'Smuggling drugs?
- Will you take your hand off?'

1622
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,400
I'll call you back

1623
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,000
You rubbed a policeman
the wrong way, then what?

1624
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,000
Do you suspect anyone?

1625
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,200
- They seized Kumar's car, right?
- Yes, sir

1626
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,320
Why can't Kumar be the culprit?

1627
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,000
It's a possibility, sir

1628
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,120
Don't say 'may be'

1629
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,240
Collect the evidence

1630
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,600
Move

1631
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,320
'Do you suspect anyone?'

1632
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,760
How did you let him die?

1633
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,840
Couldn't you identify a single face?

1634
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,360
I know the man behind this, uncle

1635
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,880
- What do you mean?
- Ravi came with his boys to kill me

1636
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,240
I was their target

1637
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:48,920
They killed Guna

1638
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,960
Narayana, post-mortem is over

1639
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,280
Arrange whatever needs to be done

1640
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,880
How can you be quiet
knowing he did this?

1641
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,640
Bhaskar, get the weapons
Sketch, get ready

1642
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,520
Didn't you hear me?

1643
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,040
Machan, my brother
was my whole world

1644
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,000
He left me all alone

1645
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,480
How dare you walk into our area
after killing my brother!

1646
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,200
David, don't talk rubbish

1647
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,880
- Be calm
- Ravi anna is dead

1648
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,680
He always defended you
even if you didn't see eye to eye

1649
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,640
He was always there for us
How could you kill him?

1650
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,360
Hey! Stop it

1651
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,760
Sketch didn't kill my brother

1652
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:47,760
My brother planned to kill Sketch
while piss drunk but it misfired

1653
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,160
'Our car collided into a tree'

1654
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,800
'We got out of the car and ran'

1655
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,440
'But another gang killed Guna'

1656
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,720
'I saw them'

1657
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,520
Sketch was right there

1658
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,080
How could Sketch
have killed my brother?

1659
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,160
Guna's murderer has killed my brother

1660
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,560
Sketch, you go

1661
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,960
Bro, take him away

1662
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,200
Sketch, if you know
Guna's assailant, tell me

1663
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,800
If I know who killed
my brother, I'll tell you

1664
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,200
But his death will be
only by my hands

1665
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,200
Sir, I told you repeatedly

1666
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,080
Couldn't you be quiet for a while?

1667
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:37,240
We can take it easy if it is
just politics or mere violence

1668
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,520
This is murder, sir
You can go behind bars

1669
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,000
Let the election get over

1670
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,120
We'll close their chapter then

1671
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,640
Then it's your wish

1672
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,920
It's locked

1673
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:55,440
Shall we enquire next door?

1674
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,920
Can I see Priya-

1675
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,920
- Priya, come here
- Coming, akka

1676
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,280
Where is Ammu?
House is locked

1677
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,360
Ammu has gone to her hometown

1678
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,040
Explain everything in detail to him

1679
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,520
Her relative is in Kumbakonam

1680
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,320
They took her and got her engaged
She was taken completely by surprise

1681
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,440
She is getting married in Chennai
on the 18th of this month

1682
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:26,240
She may have felt bad to tell you
That's why she wouldn't have

1683
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,800
Please pretend as if you don't know

1684
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,880
If you love in excess
this is the end result

1685
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,720
'Excuse me
All the best'

1686
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,400
'Don't add all the good karma
into your account'

1687
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,760
'Give me some'

1688
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:05,360
"My silence is broken as soon as
your eyes speak with eloquence"

1689
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:10,760
"Your words are my world truly
I am your sentence utterly"

1690
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:20,720
"You're the time keeper, lass
of my heart transparent as glass"

1691
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:25,640
"Girl, in your waterfall tresses
my moustache like a creeper caresses"

1692
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:29,320
"Who is she?
Who is this lovable lassie?"

1693
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,480
"Who is this bewitching me?"

1694
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:38,240
"With your hazel eyes as bait
you keep me awake; eagerly I wait"

1695
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,880
"You rock me and sing a lullaby
Then why do you bid me goodbye?"

1696
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,400
'You rubbed a policeman
the wrong way'

1697
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,040
'Sketch, if you know
Guna's assailant, tell me'

1698
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,640
'But his death will be
only by my hands'

1699
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,560
If Chitti's death isn't an accident...

1700
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,080
...Guna's killer must have killed Chitti

1701
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,960
Someone is orchestrating this

1702
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,800
Sketch, you seized Kumar's car in a rush

1703
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,480
He is behind all this

1704
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,560
Why will Kumar-

1705
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,400
Sketch, he is a shortcut millionaire

1706
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,320
He can't take insults easily

1707
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,400
Don't imagine, uncle

1708
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,280
Kumar should have
targeted Bhaskar or me

1709
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,160
Why would he kill Ravi?

1710
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,600
Someone who is our enemy has-

1711
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,160
What, Sketch?

1712
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,360
What is the discussion?

1713
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,200
- Nothing, Sait
- Okay, see you

1714
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,280
Go...bye

1715
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,600
After servicing why did Chitti
deliver the car to the client?

1716
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,520
Sait told him to deliver it

1717
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,680
You can find the address and
phone # in our bill book

1718
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:57,960
Get it for me

1719
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,760
Not connecting

1720
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,720
What is the address?

1721
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,720
Saravanan, Mettu street

1722
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,960
Villivakkam

1723
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,640
Know any of our boys in Villivakkam?

1724
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,520
- Tell me
- Are you in your area?

1725
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,440
- Yes
- I'll text you an address

1726
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,160
Will you let me know
who lives there?

1727
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,280
I'll find out from the boys

1728
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,120
- What?
- You promised

1729
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,600
...to take me to my mother's house

1730
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,440
I said I'll come and drop you

1731
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,880
- How many times will you call?
- Work is your 1st wife!

1732
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,800
This is something very important

1733
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,000
When are you coming?

1734
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,320
Nag-nag all the time

1735
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,560
Who was it?
You cut the call

1736
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,000
- My wife
- What does she want?

1737
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,120
Wants to visit her mother

1738
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,160
Baby showers and rituals

1739
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,920
She's pregnant
Go and be with her

1740
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,480
- Stop supporting her!
- Go, man

1741
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,240
'- Yes, Thyagu
- Hey! Dhansu'

1742
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,600
- What, bro?
- Had lunch?

1743
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:55,840
Not yet, boss asked me
to wipe the car

1744
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,240
Go and eat first

1745
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,400
No such address in that area

1746
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:03,200
We have the car #, right?

1747
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,720
Ask the RTO officer
for the owner's address

1748
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,720
Whom do you want?

1749
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,520
- Manicka Vinayagam
- My father

1750
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,680
Is he at home?

1751
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,720
Appa...?

1752
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,680
- Chithra?
- Coming

1753
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,560
- Bring coffee
- It's alright

1754
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,520
It's okay, go make coffee, dear

1755
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,080
Ford Fiesta black car

1756
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,600
9997
Is it yours?

1757
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,160
Did you see it anywhere?

1758
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,760
You gave it for service

1759
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,760
I don't understand, sir

1760
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,680
My car was stolen 15 days ago

1761
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,480
I lodged a complaint
at the police station

1762
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,160
I even have a copy with me

1763
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,120
Meena, get the FIR copy to sho-

1764
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,680
It's alright
Don't have to show

1765
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,400
We came regarding this

1766
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,360
- Where was it stolen?
- Madhar Sha, Purasawakkam

1767
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,200
They stole it from the main road

1768
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,800
Sir, what about my car?

1769
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,200
You have complained, right?

1770
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,600
Pressurize the police
You'll get it

1771
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:09,480
Someone has stolen his car
and given it for service

1772
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,440
He has used the car
after service to kill

1773
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,800
- Where did he say?
- Purasawakkam

1774
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,040
Call Mari

1775
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,040
- Yes, Sketch
- Simple matter

1776
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,000
- Know any car thief in Purasawakkam?
- Why do you ask?

1777
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,960
To enquire about a stolen car

1778
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,080
I don't know anyone in this area

1779
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,960
But whoever does
has to inform Johnson

1780
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,360
Then I need to meet Johnson

1781
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,240
- Mari, new hunt, huh?
- Shut your gob and go, man

1782
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,560
Sketch, wait here
I'll talk to Johnson

1783
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,480
Did you steal some car or what?

1784
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,760
Nothing of that sort

1785
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,160
Those boys over there

1786
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,920
Close friends of mine

1787
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:03,040
Don't know who stole
their car in Purasawakkam

1788
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,320
I wanted to know if you can
help us find out

1789
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:08,240
You seem to imply
one of my boys stole!

1790
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,080
I came here trusting you, Johnson

1791
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,720
Then it's up to you

1792
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,520
Let me do this

1793
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:19,280
I'll ask my boys
to enquire about the car

1794
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,680
- Okay, see you
- Go, Mari

1795
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,840
- Is everything fine?
- Yes, sir

1796
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,320
- Everything okay, sir
- Be alert

1797
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,280
What's up with you now?

1798
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,680
Why haven't you come home as yet?

1799
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,880
I told you not to call me

1800
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,840
Aren't you worried I am
all alone in this condition?

1801
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,200
I won't come
Disconnect now

1802
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,560
- I'm talking only to you
- Hang up now

1803
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,480
Hello

1804
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,280
- What's bugging you?
- Nagging me

1805
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,360
Bhaskar

1806
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,600
Look how rude he is, bro

1807
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,360
He will be home in an hour

1808
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,400
Trust me

1809
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,800
Stop...stop

1810
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,280
- Sketch?
- What?

1811
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,560
Johnson called

1812
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,840
He got the fellow

1813
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,720
He asked me to bring you
over to the shop

1814
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,960
Let's go, quick

1815
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,600
- Hey! Go home
- What?

1816
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,560
I'll update you in the morning

1817
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:12,880
Mari

1818
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,840
Stick to Sketch

1819
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,240
Come...come

1820
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,680
Shall we go?

1821
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,640
Mari, you go
I'll handle this

1822
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,040
Lock the shop and go home

1823
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,640
- What's your name?
- Sketch

1824
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:29,920
Sit

1825
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,320
See you

1826
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:37,120
Your knife

1827
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:38,520
...has fallen down

1828
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,800
You might forget it

1829
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,760
The tall chap over there
He's the one, Sketch

1830
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,320
Now that you've told me

1831
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,840
Leave

1832
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,200
Like selling salt to the sea
sketch for Sketch, huh?

1833
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,440
Don't let go of me

1834
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,480
- Don't let go
- Scared, huh?

1835
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,200
Answer the call

1836
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,520
Hold me, please

1837
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:53,440
Murthy, job done?

1838
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,120
In a minute

1839
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,640
Hey! Who is this?

1840
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:57,840
What's up?

1841
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,040
Choking for breath?

1842
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:00,560
You, huh?

1843
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,920
In a short while
even that will be snuffed

1844
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,280
Forget killing me

1845
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:07,960
Go save the only chap
still alive in your gang!

1846
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,520
What is your name?
Bhaskar, right?

1847
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,880
Go...go

1848
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,080
What, man?

1849
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,520
Someone is chasing me, sir
Please protect me

1850
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,480
Krishnamurthy, check it out

1851
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,120
I can't see anyone, sir

1852
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,640
- They must have left seeing you
- No one?

1853
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,400
- Which area?
- Puliyanthope, sir

1854
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,920
- Puliyanthope?
- Yes, sir

1855
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,960
2 victims were killed in this area

1856
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,160
My friends, sir

1857
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:20,400
Get into some mess and
come running to us

1858
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:23,120
Krishnamurthy, drop him
safely at home

1859
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,480
'This event occurred post 12 midnight'

1860
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:51,440
'Identity of the serial killer
still remains a mystery'

1861
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:57,760
'People are losing faith in the police
due to the serial murders in North Chennai'

1862
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,960
'Priyanka from News 7'

1863
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,040
- Hello
- Keep moving

1864
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,480
Don't disturb

1865
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:25,080
How could you leave me and go?

1866
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,960
Didn't you promise to name our baby?

1867
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Who will be with me
and our baby, Bhaskar?

1868
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:35,000
'Even if you get mad at me and yell...'

1869
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,600
'...you'll always defend me, Bhaskar'

1870
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,680
Jeeva, all of us are grieving too

1871
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,280
Just see his face once

1872
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,480
Even if you want to
see him later, you can't

1873
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,360
Please listen to me

1874
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:07,000
You abandoned me
I am an orphan now

1875
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,400
Bhaskar!

1876
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,680
Bhaskar!

1877
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,160
Anna...!

1878
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,280
You said he'll be home in an hour?

1879
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,800
He came back to me
as a corpse, look at him

1880
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,880
'Both our friends are gone'

1881
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,520
'Nothing should happen to Sketch'

1882
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:29,200
Look at the plight of the man
who kept telling me that

1883
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,720
Aiyo! Bhaskar

1884
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,120
Anna...?

1885
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,960
I'm going to my hometown tomorrow

1886
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:02,960
1 minute

1887
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,320
Come inside, ma

1888
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,640
- I don't want money please
- I'm like your brother

1889
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,840
Accept it for now

1890
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,640
1 minute

1891
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,400
'I'm Ammu speaking'

1892
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,960
'I want to see you
I'm waiting at the ground'

1893
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,120
Came to invite me for your wedding?

1894
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,040
If I invite you, will you come
and bless me and go?

1895
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,800
I'm not the kind to love one man

1896
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,680
And marry someone else

1897
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:49,120
Do you know something?

1898
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,880
Many girls have told me

1899
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:53,560
'I am unable to marry
the man I love'

1900
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:56,280
'I might as well lead a life
as ordained by God'

1901
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,640
Then why fall in love, huh?

1902
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,280
I am not the kind to lead
the life ordained by God

1903
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,440
I want to lead a life
I know I'll love

1904
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,720
If I ever get married
only you'll be my husband

1905
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,200
All these excuses of
emotional blackmail

1906
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:22,120
I am not the kind to change
my mind in any of these situations

1907
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,200
What is this then?

1908
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,880
Wondering why I agreed?

1909
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,360
If not this one, my father
will fix another groom

1910
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,280
How many times will I say 'no'?

1911
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,920
I am repeating what
I told you the other day

1912
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,600
'The extent of my love for you'

1913
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,200
'I want to live with you
and demonstrate'

1914
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,880
Whatever you say is right

1915
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,240
But my situation isn't conducive

1916
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,200
Marry the man
your father has chosen for you

1917
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,400
See you

1918
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,760
Everyone won't be blessed
to get the life they wish

1919
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,120
Let us think the same

1920
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,160
I know what's churning in your mind

1921
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,840
The wedding is at 7:30 a.m

1922
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,880
I'll be waiting for you till 7:29 a.m

1923
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,680
You had better come and take me

1924
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,000
I'll be waiting for you

1925
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:32,800
"Come and live with me for eternity"

1926
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:38,080
"Anchor our love, conquer my femininity"

1927
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:44,360
"Shall I conquer the femininity
you offer willingly to me?"

1928
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:50,040
"Come, merge with me
You and me will emerge as we"

1929
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,520
You told me right then
the culprit is Kumar

1930
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,160
I didn't believe you

1931
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,920
I've decided to kill him

1932
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,480
'The police will deal with Kumar'

1933
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,760
We've already lost 3 of our lot

1934
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,760
Dump all this and hide
somewhere safe and come later

1935
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,640
- Hey! Dhanusu
- Sait

1936
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,600
- Keep this bag in my car
- Okay, sait

1937
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:23,400
My fault, letting you seize that car!

1938
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,560
What wrong did I do?

1939
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,080
I seized a car

1940
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:28,760
That's all

1941
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:30,200
That's my job

1942
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,640
That too, not his car
It belonged to you

1943
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:36,200
Let's say I park this
damn car in his house

1944
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:39,640
Can Guna, Chitti, Bhaskar
be brought back alive?

1945
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,240
After all it's a car, sait

1946
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,800
'It isn't as easy as you think'

1947
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:49,480
You are a lone crusader
He has an army

1948
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,920
I've decided to-

1949
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,920
Why is he a lone man?

1950
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,880
I am there for him

1951
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,360
I was once adept with a knife

1952
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,840
My boys are just maintaining their distance

1953
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:04,320
One nod from me
the whole lot will back me up

1954
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:05,880
That isn't the poin-

1955
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,400
You thought I'll send someone
to light a lamp for Bhaskar's funeral

1956
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,640
The lamp in our house has been snuffed

1957
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,200
He should only be a corpse

1958
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:16,240
You plan your sketch

1959
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:17,720
I'll bring my boys

1960
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:28,120
Martin, Dorai here

1961
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,000
- Tell me
- You have to kill someone

1962
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,520
When and where?

1963
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,160
Good evening, sir

1964
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,480
Sit down

1965
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:47,200
Stop, zoom this chap

1966
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,440
Kavi, this chap is so familiar

1967
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,800
The gang at the tea stall
attending a wedding

1968
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:56,360
Call the lodge owner and collect
all their details right now

1969
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,560
Make it fast

1970
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,880
Sketch, you were right
There's a lamp post near his house

1971
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,960
I studied the area from my sister's shop

1972
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,360
He's often on the phone
from his balcony

1973
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,840
Then we should decide
only the time of crime, right?

1974
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:52,520
We usually strike pre-dawn

1975
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,480
No one can enter Royapuram that easily

1976
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:56,480
Why not?

1977
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,720
Even if a kid enters
he will ask 10 men about the kid

1978
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,880
- Ambulance can enter, right?
- Sure

1979
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:04,280
That ambulance will spell danger

1980
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,600
Because...

1981
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:06,920
...I'll be inside

1982
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,400
But you can't smuggle weapons in it

1983
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,800
- I'll deal with it
- Who will take the weapon?

1984
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:15,160
Watch when I kill him

1985
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:17,320
Tell me

1986
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:18,560
Are you sure?

1987
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:19,840
Sir

1988
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,160
We know that gang's hide-out

1989
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:23,080
- Where?
- Capital Residency

1990
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:39,880
Sketch, it's all A-OK

1991
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:43,200
We'll ask our men to
come back in the morning

1992
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:44,920
Assemble on the dot

1993
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,040
You can go now

1994
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,640
- See you, Sketch
- Uncle, 1 minute

1995
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:53,320
She vowed she'll marry only me
and gave me the wedding invitation

1996
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:55,880
She said she'll be waiting for me

1997
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,840
Wanted me to land up
and take her with me

1998
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:00,480
I must close Kumar's chapter
So I'll be in Royapuram

1999
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,000
Mari and you go to this venue

2000
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,720
Suppose she gets married

2001
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,240
...to the groom
her father has finalized

2002
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,200
Bless her and come away

2003
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,480
Suppose her wedding
does get cancelled

2004
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:15,360
...bring her to Periyar ground

2005
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:16,760
I'll finish my job by then

2006
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,080
Sketch, I'll come with you

2007
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,640
- Mari, take him
- Let him go

2008
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:20,800
Go, uncle

2009
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:23,080
Come, bro
Let's go

2010
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,640
'Have you ever seen
a watch on my wrist?'

2011
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:42,400
'Whenever you miss me
wear this to think of me'

2012
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,120
'Do you like me very much?'

2013
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:33,080
'The extent of my love for you'

2014
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:36,240
'I want to live with you
and demonstrate'

2015
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,800
Anna!

2016
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:44,400
'Where is she going now?'

2017
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,000
To change into her wedding saree

2018
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:47,760
Then she's getting married for sure

2019
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,440
Bro, Kumar is in his balcony

2020
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:33,680
'Only event you are not
envious you missed is death'

2021
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:37,000
'You yearned for it
You have to experience it'

2022
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:22,840
- Ammu
- What happened?

2023
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:26,200
- Ammu, open the door
- What is she doing inside?

2024
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,480
All of you please forgive me

2025
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:49,160
I'm not in favor of this wedding

2026
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:54,680
Let's go wait outside

2027
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,880
Treatment is for you
Not for him

2028
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:09,960
As we keep splashing
cold water on his face...

2029
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
...you'll see him gasp for breath
and cough up the truth

2030
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:16,200
If he dies, your turn next

2031
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:19,080
Pour

2032
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,040
Sir, I'll tell you

2033
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:32,360
Kavi, stop

2034
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:39,520
All set?

2035
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:41,600
- Packed all my clothes?
- Yes, bro

2036
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:44,720
- Filled fuel in the auto?
- Done, bro

2037
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,160
Okay, take this auto and-

2038
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,000
1 minute
I'll call uncle

2039
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:55,480
'Tell me, bro'

2040
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:20,400
Why...?

2041
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:27,040
'If these boys usurp my place
I have to water camels in Rajasthan!'

2042
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,720
Why should you feed
the camels in Rajasthan?

2043
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:33,240
We can't bear to see you in that state

2044
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,840
Sillu, strike

2045
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:50,360
'We wanted to be like you
from the beginning'

2046
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,920
'But we couldn't oppose you
and move forward'

2047
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,400
'How long will we work under you?'

2048
02:01:55,440 --> 02:02:00,240
'When sait gifted you with a gold chain
for stealing Kumar's car, we knew'

2049
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:03,240
We can't reach great heights
with them around

2050
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:05,920
'Whatever we did
was always wrong in your eyes'

2051
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,800
'You side lined us
with a knock on our heads'

2052
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,080
'That's when we had a bright brainwave'

2053
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:15,320
We should finish off all 4 of them

2054
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,920
'The sketch we sketched
for all 4 of you'

2055
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:19,480
'...hit the bull's eye, bro'

2056
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:24,280
Kumar called us to Chennai
to kill that gang of 4, sir

2057
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,520
'We gave a car
for service in a garage'

2058
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:29,520
'We planned to kill them
when they deliver the car, sir'

2059
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,960
'The car parked in a spot
earlier than where we planned'

2060
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,680
'No one got down from the car
I asked the crane operator to stop'

2061
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:39,600
'But he thought my plan was
to crush the car and he reacted'

2062
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:43,800
'We sprayed methanol in the car's AC
before Chitti bro delivered the car'

2063
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:48,120
'Get lost'

2064
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:50,760
'Chittianna must have died on the way'

2065
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,240
'But when we heard he died in an accident'

2066
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,480
'...we were ourselves quite stunned'

2067
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,840
'We stole Valliakka's mobile and
called Gunaanna to her area'

2068
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,360
'We didn't expect you to be with him'

2069
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:05,040
'Still we killed Gunaanna'

2070
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:16,760
A knife was already lodged in his neck, sir

2071
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:18,200
We stabbed him after that

2072
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:21,080
- Who killed Ravi?
- Who is Ravi, sir?

2073
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:29,320
I killed Guna
Ravi anna saw me

2074
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,840
Gone case!

2075
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:34,280
'We had no choice
but to kill Ravi anna too'

2076
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,920
'Who killed Bhaskar and the policeman?'

2077
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:47,160
True, we chased Bhaskar

2078
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,960
But seeing a policeman with him
we backtracked, sir

2079
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,560
Reverse, quick

2080
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,560
'When we killed Bhaskaranna
that poor policeman tagged along'

2081
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:10,040
Come on

2082
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:16,120
We knew only from the papers the next day
Bhaskar and the policeman were killed

2083
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:18,360
We have nothing to do
with that murder, sir

2084
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:21,960
Where is Sketch now?

2085
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,320
'We wanted to let you off actually'

2086
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:30,440
But you'll track us down
some day or the other

2087
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:32,400
'That's why we stabbed you'

2088
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:33,800
Get out of here

2089
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,040
Crackpots!

2090
