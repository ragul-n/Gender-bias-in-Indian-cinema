1
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,943
Our epics say that Parasurama,
an incarnation of Lord Vishnu

2
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:22,181
flung an axe and created Kerala, the land
of pepper. But for the western world,

3
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:31,000
it was Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese
sailor, who discovered Kerala.

4
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:37,192
In 1498 to enter into India roaming
around African country...

5
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:46,835
Young achiever Vasco gathered his men
Paulo da Cama, Michel & Bonsalo...

6
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:58,496
He started his journey in 4 ships
with the blessing is Manuel king.

7
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:07,295
The men on the ships
were mostly convicts...

8
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:12,894
Sailing, they finally reached
Melindi in Africa...

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,400
threatened the king and got
a Gujarati pilot to join them.

10
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,015
He guided them to Calicut.

11
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:32,030
Kerala welcomed them
as it welcomes all guests.

12
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,290
Gama's logbook describes our people
as men who pretended

13
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:47,803
to know more than they did
and short women lacking beauty.

14
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,847
The Samoodiri, a powerful
and God-fearing ruler

15
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:07,992
showed no interest
at all in Gama's gifts.

16
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,138
At that time, pepper in Kerala was
valued as highly as oil in the Gulf now.

17
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,010
Gama's eyes were riveted
on the pepper.

18
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,309
Is this the Goddess?
Will you give me this pendant?

19
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,246
Gama offered to buy the pepper
for three times its price.

20
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:39,595
But Samoodiri showed no interest.

21
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,130
Take him to the dining hall
and give him food.

22
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:58,611
Leaving some of his people behind,
Gama left, none too pleased.

23
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,340
Lisbon had grand celebrations
in his honour.

24
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:10,645
History praised Gama as the great man,
who discovered a sea route to wealth.

25
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:24,140
But the future of our country was
jeopardized by a handful of pepper.

26
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:38,473
Let history end there.
This movie begins with two young men

27
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:44,012
who have no interest in their own
history and who don't believe that

28
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:49,087
the past has a tendency
to repeat itself Krishnadas,

29
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,900
known as KD and
Tan seer known as Tarzan.

30
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:58,393
There's drumming in the north
while we dance in the south...

31
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:03,368
And you can see the eastern
mynah in the south.

32
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:08,240
There's drumming in the north
while we dance in the south...

33
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,485
And you can see the eastern
mynah in the south.

34
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,449
Give me money, then you play.

35
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,455
I don't have money Wait for a week.
I'll surely give. I swear on him.

36
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,384
Daisy da Cunha.

37
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:49,126
Head of the Real Estate Division
of Nirvana a mining corporation.

38
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:55,698
Our group is interested in your
ancestral property in Kerala.

39
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,269
But I don't have
any property in Kerala.

40
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:05,063
The property where
a tribal school is being run...

41
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:10,035
My mother's ancestral home.
It was sold, taken away from us.

42
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,107
No, no one took it away.

43
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,339
Your grandfather, His Highness
Ravi Varma Raja, leased it out.

44
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,823
The lease has expired.

45
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:26,547
As the last royal heir,
you're the sole owner.

46
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,920
How much is there?

47
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,623
Official documents state that
the land measures up to 102 acres.

48
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,160
One acre has been inhabited by locals.
You know the market value...

49
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,428
Who's this?

50
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,231
He is a Member of the Legislative
Assembly of that region.

51
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,042
Is your uncle an influential
High Court Judge?

52
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:48,903
Here's a small advance.
We're offering 3 times the value.

53
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,421
You can make inquiries and negotiate.

54
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:57,018
If you need help, Kaimal is your man.

55
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,814
I feel no nostalgia,
no sense of homecoming.

56
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:33,084
Thank God, you have no sentimental
issues selling it to foreigners.

57
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,688
That woman from the NGO looks
after it now. She's tough.

58
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,359
She'll have sob stories to tell.
Say firmly that you've decided...

59
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,533
Hey! Let me ask... Your teacher...?

60
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:07,020
Did you bring it? -What?

61
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,262
What a figure! Super!

62
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,777
Who is she?
Did you get scared, Krishnadas?

63
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,570
I'm Bhumi.

64
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,380
NGO...

65
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:34,653
I wanted to thank you for running this
institution all these years in my mother's name.

66
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:41,360
There's a social issue involved
in the sale of your property.

67
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,257
I'm in no position
to think of all that.

68
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,831
You have to look at it in totality.

69
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:58,136
There's an international mining
corporation working behind

70
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,339
the political nexus
that brought you here.

71
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,943
I know. Nirvana.
They came to see me.

72
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,944
Then you know the environmental
hazards of mining in this region?

73
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,149
Whose?

74
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,926
So you don't have
any kind of social commitment?

75
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,526
No.

76
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:24,225
According to your mother, the late
Chandramani Thamburatti's decision

77
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:29,937
2 signatories are required
to complete this sale.

78
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:38,614
Who? There's no relative
who won't succumb if offered money.

79
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:44,358
If it's someone who doesn't
even know what money is?

80
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,686
After the death of this girl's mother,
your mom took care of her.

81
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,760
She was entrusted to my mother
along with the keys to the school.

82
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:09,003
She is a nominee.

83
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,753
It's as if your mother foresaw
what is happening today.

84
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,282
Look, if you have no alternative,
once the lease period is over...

85
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,692
no one can prevent you
from selling this property.

86
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:32,693
As for this child all you need is
her thumb impression.

87
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,401
You just have to ask her.

88
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,839
She's not capable of refusing
or taking some other decision.

89
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,210
But if you decide that
you are definitely going to sell...

90
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,480
this sale will destroy
the faith of a 100 families...

91
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,983
and the foundation
we built this Institution on.

92
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,865
You need to let them know.

93
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:06,927
This is your mother's pen.

94
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:12,045
Use it to sign the documents.

95
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,552
So, are you going
to meet them in the forest?

96
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,801
Krishna!

97
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,892
Tarzan!

98
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,861
Not you! I'm calling Lord Krishna.

99
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,130
God! Protect me

100
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,340
it's because of you that I have
to walk over stones and thorns.

101
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,086
These people have a right over
the land you're going to sell.

102
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,255
They have their own customs.
Come and meet Thangachan.

103
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,623
Whom ...? Thangachan?

104
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,104
I...! -Me.

105
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:21,785
Get permission to sell
from our chief, the tiger.

106
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,974
Only the queen been remained.

107
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,910
But that was enough for
all of us to come back.

108
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,181
Are you Thangachan?

109
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:04,516
I ask the questions.
Do you know who you are?

110
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,819
I'm Krishnadas. Don't ask for my ID.

111
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,824
Those men with guns took it away.

112
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,796
Do you know Rama Varma Raja?

113
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,328
He's my father. A cartoonist.

114
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,331
He used to say that
I'm the worst cartoon he drew!

115
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,166
So you're my father's friend.

116
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,867
Nice to meet you, Uncle. Untie me.

117
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,102
This rock surface.

118
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,074
So you know your father.
Your father's father?

119
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,482
Ravi Varma.

120
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:38,584
You know your father's father.
His father's father's father's father?

121
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,859
I came here for a real estate deal...

122
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,764
To sell my ancestral property.
You needn't mock me.

123
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,212
What do you want?

124
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,237
You came to sell the land we stand on.

125
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,242
Do you know the warrior,
who shed his blood for it?

126
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,910
You took crooked roads to get here.

127
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:12,829
Before you sell, place a fistful of earth
in your hand and think of your lineage.

128
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,021
The Portuguese who brought money
and gold to buy pepper

129
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:22,563
swore to destroy our land. Your ancestor,
Kelu, was then 8 years old.

130
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,441
The convicts Vasco left behind
looted our land without mercy.

131
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,319
There was one person
who could protect us.

132
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,663
Father!

133
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,565
They're attacking Abdu's wedding house.

134
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,687
You enter my house and act insolent?

135
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:25,825
You should know that this is
Chirakkal that I am Chirakkal Kothuval.

136
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:32,374
Did you cross the seas just
to desecrate the soil of our land?

137
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,606
Never harm a woman or a child.

138
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,077
That's the rule of our Kingdom.

139
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:58,096
Our country was his way to wealth
knowing that, Vasco came again.

140
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,964
Not to beg, but to wage war.

141
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,133
He came with 15 warships

142
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:14,134
and sighted a ship returning
from a pilgrimage to Mecca.

143
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,143
He captured it.

144
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:24,144
There were over 400 people in it
including women and children.

145
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,754
Al Faqi, its owner, offered him
4 shiploads of gold and pepper

146
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,090
but Vasco denied the offer.

147
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,794
These atrocities made
the country furious.

148
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,663
Ask the Dubash to write a letter.

149
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,866
Let the Brahmin go
with his son to negotiate.

150
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,169
They will not harm a father,
who comes unarmed with his son.

151
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,806
I am ready. But to sacrifice my son...

152
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,310
I have only him to perform
my last rites.

153
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:59,991
There's no time to talk
400 lives are in danger.

154
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,487
I'll send my son.

155
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:07,699
Chirakkal Kothuval's son, Kelu,
will come with you to the ship.

156
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,705
Are you scared'?

157
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,838
Your mother and father are with you.

158
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,377
Never bow down before
an enemy. That is dharma.

159
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,711
I will be with you.

160
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,714
A father's promise.

161
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:56,750
A whole country waited
for their return.

162
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:07,856
Vasco had expected the Samoodiri
and Kothuval to come for talks.

163
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:15,337
He despised these messengers
and their strange customs.

164
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:22,129
In the child's eyes he saw
an enemy being born...

165
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:27,608
a clan who would never
surrender its pride.

166
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,366
That foreign ship must sink
into the sea with the sun today.

167
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,635
No vestige of Vasco's
arrogance must remain.

168
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,344
From next year, Kothuval can
perform obsequies for his son.

169
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,039
You insult the land that feeds you
forget Chenicheri's teachings.

170
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,113
Only those who want
to come need come

171
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:14,257
Chenicheri Kurup remember his name.
You'll soon meet him.

172
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,826
Don't harm him, he's only a child.

173
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,808
Is this how you behave towards those
who come to make peace?

174
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:30,297
Vasco sliced off the tongue and
ears of the poor peace-maker.

175
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:35,769
Vasco had his disobedient dog's ears
sewn onto the poor man's face.

176
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,689
The world now praises him
as a great man!

177
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,953
Father!

178
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,495
Jump!

179
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,066
Kelu, go!

180
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:15,774
On the shore covered with corpses
lay a mother, not quite dead.

181
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:21,608
The jewels she'd wanted to give
Vasco's men in exchange for her life...

182
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,916
she gave to Kelu.

183
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:30,798
He took them with hands that did not
tremble and with a heart that burned.

184
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:39,726
Ali found him there, cold
and hungry and took him home.

185
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:03,899
He nurtured within him, revenge.

186
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:10,227
This sword called the Urumi
needs a drop of your life.

187
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:14,565
The Portuguese empire
spread from Cochin to Goa.

188
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:20,517
To halt its growth, a golden weapon
with a soul of fire took life in him.

189
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,575
'A weapon must have inner strength'.

190
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,819
His father's words guided him.

191
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:32,921
The sword is not held in a warrior's
hands, it has to be within him.

192
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:56,913
Kelu grew up.
His sole aim to kill Vasco.

193
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:08,560
He learnt to walk in forests
filled with beasts of prey.

194
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,270
O forefathers! Show me
a fire on which to roast him.

195
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:37,107
Let it go, Vavvali.
There's life in its belly.

196
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:44,617
How? You're right. It's a female.

197
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:52,462
My father said: 'Never harm
Women and children'.

198
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,795
Don't break that rule
and bring evil upon us. Let it go.

199
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,902
My mother told you not to starve me.
Don't her words have value?

200
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,311
You're right.
There's life in its belly.

201
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,076
My effort was futile, that's all.

202
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,713
If you're hungry,
you know we'll soon be home.

203
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,920
Friend!

204
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,649
From Chirakkal.

205
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,324
Yes, it's Chirakkal's Princess.

206
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,826
Lord Siva, let my country
never want for grain.

207
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,866
May its fame and prosperity
spread over the seven seas.

208
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,600
If you chase a beautiful woman,
she'll blow your heart like a conch.

209
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,018
Let her blow it!
Let her keep blowing it!

210
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,180
The girl standing at the shrine
is Bala of Chirakkal...

211
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,316
I want her alive, with her hands
and legs bound only her!

212
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:03,087
Stop wagging your tongue,
show me how smart you are.

213
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,290
Yes, I'm Chirakkal Bala.

214
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,193
You can't tie me up, nor can you

215
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,607
even touch a flower
on the heads of my maids.

216
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,102
Go and teach that
arrogant fellow a lesson!

217
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,787
It just made a sound and he died...?

218
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:04,264
Go and inform the tainted foreign
owners of this dirty weapon...

219
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:10,319
that their death is drawing near.

220
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,329
Go! Run off!

221
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,327
What is this?

222
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,696
You saw, it spits fire.

223
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,333
A fire-spitter.

224
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:42,512
Good muscle power...what about
your Will power? Give it to me.

225
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:48,445
This is not for hands that know only
silver balls and golden cords.

226
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:53,050
Ask your father, he might make
you one like this to play with.

227
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,725
Come, Vavvali.

228
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:06,430
This was made by foreign hands,
not by villagers.

229
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,234
An invitation from the one
we were searching for.

230
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,202
Come, we have to go to Puthur.

231
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,537
Let's not talk about foreigners.

232
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,805
Talk about food, I'm hungry.

233
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,151
Look, Allah has sent the food I want!

234
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,895
So much for the elephant?
See what I got!

235
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,993
I'm so hungry!

236
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:49,206
Who is that cheering, Who is that
dancing in passionate abandon?

237
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,442
We'll do a warrior-dance
in the beautiful forest.

238
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:56,013
It's him, my friend
who is leading the team.

239
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,549
It's true, so true.
He came to keep us company.

240
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,220
Look at the earth,
it's earth that sprouts gold.

241
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,723
It's where our forefathers
shed their blood.

242
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:11,724
Take all the good and reject the bad.
Let our granaries be filled with joy and happiness.

243
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,775
Who is that cheering, who is that
dancing in passionate abandon?

244
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,314
We'll do a warrior-dance
in the beautiful forest.

245
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,431
Let's welcome the spring
with festival drums.

246
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,505
We are ready to dance
and sing in the fields...

247
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:59,476
Wear traditional dress.
Stand in a circle.

248
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,379
Clap your hands and sing and dance.

249
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,380
See how our crops flourish and dance.

250
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,823
O my friend! You're my very soul.

251
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,824
Take all the good and reject the bad.
Let our granaries be filled with joy and happiness.

252
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:31,141
Who is that cheering, who is that
dancing in passionate abandon?

253
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,578
We'll do a warrior-dance
in the beautiful forest.

254
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:38,215
It's him, my friend
who is leading the team.

255
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,718
It's true, so true.
He came to keep us company.

256
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:46,964
Look at the earth,
it's earth that sprouts gold.

257
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,629
It's where our forefathers
shed their blood.

258
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,630
Take all the good and reject the bad.
Let our granaries be filled with joy and happiness.

259
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:30,674
Bow your heads
to the Prince of Chirakkal!

260
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,045
Vavvali!

261
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:47,017
Kings don't demand obeisance.
Only the arrogant do that.

262
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:47,584
Allah!

263
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,421
My father said:
'Never bow down to a tyrant'.

264
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,366
Friend!

265
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,242
This is not a gift for the palace.

266
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:08,434
Tear the skin off his back
with my whip.

267
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,707
Dearest!

268
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,154
Please don't be foolish!

269
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,603
This is the king, the best of men,
he who safeguards us with...

270
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:44,604
gold and grain. May he reign
on his throne forever.

271
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,486
The King feared the prediction
that there was danger

272
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:01,124
if his son succeeded him,
not his daughter.

273
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,494
The King had only one true friend:
Chenicheri Kurup.

274
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:09,495
A scholar in 12 languages and
a trusted ally of the Portuguese.

275
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Of all the ministers
Vasco took back home...

276
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,741
only he was sent back alive.

277
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,677
But, there were
the reasons for these goods!

278
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:25,282
The Chirakkal goods are excellent.

279
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,919
Are you trying to deceive us?

280
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,920
What did the new traders who came
from Ceylon and Bengal give you?

281
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:39,492
I know all the people who give
your Sultan Ismail bad advice.

282
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:45,831
Did you come here to do
honest trade or show off?

283
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,777
You have to show us the same
loyalty as you show Arackal...

284
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,987
Then our reigning King
will give you a worthy prize.

285
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,352
Your policy is excellent, Chenicheri.

286
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:06,856
But I think you talk a little too much.

287
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:11,857
I cannot imagine bowing our heads
before the Arabs or the Chinese.

288
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,432
They need us.

289
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:20,433
The value for pepper is 1200 times
more in the Persian market.

290
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,206
Let the Arab go if he wants...

291
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:28,207
There's Italy, Spain,
Germany, France...

292
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,515
We can send ships there directly
and trade with them.

293
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,385
Spain, Italy! Indeed!

294
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:40,023
They said they'd give us a trade permit,
so that our ships will be safe.

295
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,893
The Arackal people have got
a permit, thanks to their minister.

296
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,729
Why blame the Portuguese?

297
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,333
The Portuguese has never
withheld anything they promised us.

298
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,270
Oh yes, they'll give it all.
I saw what they gave us.

299
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:58,174
Thanks to our minister's inefficiency
all Kolathunad got was trash!

300
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,156
- I know what I should do.
- So do I.

301
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,675
Here, betel leaves.

302
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,839
Allah!

303
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,047
Walk on!

304
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:39,011
These are the men who trapped
our people at the temple.

305
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,319
My men captured them at Puthur.

306
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,789
I've brought back the corpses
of the men we killed.

307
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,565
See this, Father?

308
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,439
You seem to grow bluer
in colour as you grow up.

309
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:03,536
My ancestors built a bridge
to welcome Gama.

310
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:08,211
Now he dares to send a weapon
to kill my daughter!

311
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:12,752
War is waged only from 6 to 6.
It's wrong to have broken that rule.

312
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,593
King! It can't be the Portuguese
who sent someone to kill the girl.

313
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:25,133
It must be Baliahasan from Arackal.

314
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:30,967
What? Arackal attacking our princess?

315
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:35,105
Don't waste time thinking drown them
in wild waters or throw them in hot oil.

316
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,874
No! Better still, let elephants
trample them to death!

317
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,014
Bring the tusker!

318
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,762
What a scary sound!

319
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:03,500
It's our punishment for
stealing the elephant's food.

320
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:07,303
A single kick must finish off the fellow
who attacked our princess.

321
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:11,081
Now don't you remember any words
your father used to say?

322
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,780
The women of the palace
do not come to the audience hall.

323
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,015
Is it the custom to punish those,
who protect us?

324
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,751
Bhanu is clever, he brought these
arrogant men before the King.

325
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,754
What stupidity!
If it wasn't for these men

326
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,202
this fire-spitter would have
blown open my heart!

327
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:33,734
Instead of punishing them you must honour
them as warriors, teacher!

328
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:41,080
Ignorant Bhanu!
You've scattered our pride.

329
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,906
Where's that dog? -King.

330
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,387
Untie these men. Free them!

331
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,218
I'll never forget
what you did for us today.

332
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,373
Rice that smells of blood!

333
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,874
Where did you complete your studies?

334
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,405
My father gave me weapons,
taught me how to use them.

335
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,875
Karikathiyamma taught me speed.

336
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,178
I learnt how to write
at Karumalayil and...

337
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:26,150
strategies of war at many centres.

338
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:31,087
Only this fellow and
his mother gave me food.

339
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:36,088
I learnt war fight from Mangadu,
Vannalacheri, Vepur & Dharmapatnam teachers.

340
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,033
A King in central Kerala
taught me warfare.

341
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,970
A Fakir in the south
who became my teacher...

342
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:51,307
sent me to finish my training
at the famous centre in Valor.

343
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,876
Who is your enemy?

344
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:57,417
He, who says one thing with
his eyes and cheats with his hands.

345
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,786
If you want my enemy's name,
it has always been

346
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,990
the man who destroyed my clan.

347
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,493
As I grow, he grows bigger,
taking over the whole country.

348
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:15,494
Bravo! A handful of Portuguese came,
asking for pepper.

349
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:24,770
Their starved bodies
were clad in tatters.

350
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:29,979
Now they dry their underwear
on the tip of my sword

351
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,949
use my throne as a step-stool
and spit orders at me!

352
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,950
Let's not stay here too long.
It's not a good place.

353
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,858
Tomorrow, to witness
the hanging of Baliahasan...

354
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:45,228
the Viceroy will come in
a ship named after St. Katrina...

355
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:50,229
Vasco da Gama, after 22 years!

356
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,169
That hanging must not take place.

357
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,738
The Portuguese who wanted

358
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,609
to kill my daughter must know that
there are brave men in Kolathunad.

359
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,478
I want Gama at my feet.

360
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,280
You have the ability to do it.

361
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,453
Will you?

362
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,318
No!

363
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,854
So you've got Chenicheri
to give these dogs a feast.

364
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,892
Good, Father.

365
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:20,196
This fellow's an obscenity
that I forgot halfway.

366
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:25,197
Gama's ready to enter the Arackal Fort.
Will you bring him to me?

367
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:30,640
Father used to say, if he who holds
his head high is formally invited

368
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,543
to take part in war, it is right
and just that he accepts

369
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:38,084
Arackal will make
mincemeat out of us.

370
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:47,827
You can't buy me!
I'll do it because I want to!

371
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:54,467
I'll bring Vasco here from Arackal.

372
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:59,502
Vasco is the lord of the Indian Ocean,
greatest of the great!

373
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:03,306
You're not even fit to stand
before the Viceroy.

374
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,008
Stop bragging, dog!

375
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,309
Prince!

376
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:11,310
I'll honour my word even before the sand
in the hourglass drips 40 times.

377
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:16,315
If the manhood under your waist cloth
has even the power of a lizard's tail...

378
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,957
clean up the obscenity
under the King's tongue.

379
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:24,727
Or if you're man enough, come with me.

380
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:28,297
I'll show you what male loyalty
means as for calling me dog...

381
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:33,298
this fellow and I have only
one caste, the caste of 'war'.

382
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:39,820
And only one class, that of a soldier.

383
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:46,412
I ate a handful of rice from here.

384
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:52,418
I give you my word in return 5 of
my best soldiers will go with you...

385
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,567
so will my prayers.

386
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,237
First Bhima...

387
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:14,120
then Yudhishtira. Arjuna,
Nakula, Sahadeva.

388
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,981
A back-up force will follow you.

389
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:23,052
No harm must come to the Viceroy.

390
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:29,129
The Muslim, Ali, and Kelu Nayanar
must not come back to Chirakkal Kelu!

391
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,876
So you're going to Arackal
to avenge me...?

392
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,813
No... yes.

393
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,639
Look at this.

394
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,450
The Serpent blessed Virgin!

395
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:54,562
The Serpent comes alive at night when
you return, I'll show you where it sleeps.

396
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,937
The roof is leaning to one side.

397
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,840
There's a mother inside
who'll never fall, whatever happens.

398
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,345
She'll have food ready for us,
no matter what time we walk in.

399
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,519
You go first.

400
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,554
Why do you want to stay outside?

401
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:35,525
Half of what she gives will be yours.

402
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,160
Okay.

403
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:42,975
Whatever it's bad or good
I'll accept it with pleasure.

404
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,344
Even if she's not the one
who bore me, she's my mother too.

405
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,689
Mother!

406
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:04,253
What a surprise!

407
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:09,254
Is no one looking after her?
Cooking all the time!

408
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:13,897
Mother!

409
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,265
Is the food ready?

410
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:19,168
Bring your women to live here.

411
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,537
Then you can ask her to cook

412
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:25,508
it's 40 days since
we've had anything fit to eat.

413
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,845
Lies! He ate the King's food
and gave him a promise.

414
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,215
I've brought him back like
I said I would.

415
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:36,385
He's taken money to gather
an army for war.

416
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,421
Look, out there.

417
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,698
The big warriors of the palace.

418
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:46,692
When I was a child, you took a throne
out of my hand once and healed my hand.

419
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,405
But the Portuguese pierced
my heart with a throne...

420
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,909
when I was 8 years old.

421
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:04,747
That wound has not healed
for 20 years.

422
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:09,748
At last, that cruel
Vasco is coming back...

423
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:17,462
to supervise the hanging
of Arackal Baliahasan.

424
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:23,244
From the age of 8, I've been carrying
this pain and now a release!

425
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:30,618
I'm going, Mother,
to put an end to him.

426
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,822
Give me your blessing.

427
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:39,444
All I have to give you is
Ali as dear to me as you are.

428
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,761
Take him.

429
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:48,229
So you don't want me, Mother?

430
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,169
Allah!

431
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:18,159
A fort like a Turkish ship Minister
Mammaly Marikar made it invincible.

432
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,992
I've heard there's
an opening in the northern wall.

433
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:27,363
By the time we get there,
Baliahasan would have been hanged

434
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,932
and a tree would have
sprouted from his grave.

435
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,436
Then, shall we return?

436
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:40,339
There's only one way to get there,
to reach the viceroy.

437
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:46,082
The Arackal Fort capable of withstanding
12 years of war fears only..

438
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:54,594
The 101 cannons pointed
from Fort St. Angelo.

439
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:03,699
We've come here readily
gathering our force.

440
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,268
We don't bother even
if anybody dies. -Hey! Stop!

441
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,038
Where do you people go?
Our Andi brother has died getting burnt.

442
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,175
So...? I should watch
Baliahasan's execution...

443
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,510
That was this expired man's final wish.

444
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,821
Not his wish. Don't bring
his curse upon you.

445
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,583
Thanks a lot, sir.

446
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:26,899
We've come here readily
gathering our force.

447
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:47,314
We got in. Now how do we get out?

448
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,620
Who's that?

449
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,117
Ayesha. Arakkal Ayesha.

450
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:58,721
Only one person at Arakkal did not...

451
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:03,192
bow her head before
the Portuguese to punish her...

452
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:07,830
the Portuguese dragged
Ayesha to an island.

453
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:12,101
She killed 9 of the 10 men
who came to molest her...

454
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,237
and left one alive to tell her tale.

455
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:20,176
People celebrated her name:
Arakkal Ayesha.

456
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,088
Is this the time to sing, sister?

457
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,748
Baliahasan guarded our honour...

458
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:30,586
While the noose tightens
around his neck, you sing!

459
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,998
Great!

460
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,826
Come quickly, Beevi's calling you.

461
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,535
Come on!

462
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:48,033
I sent for you, Ayesha to tell you
that you should not go out.

463
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,774
I know you'll dare me and go.

464
00:51:51,775 --> 00:52:00,490
The Portuguese haven't forgotten
what you did Harabichi Beevi.

465
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:06,651
You were dancing in the Arab's
tent when I first saw you.

466
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,734
I was 10 years old then.

467
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:16,328
Then, when you came
to Arackal with my Father...

468
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:21,546
I put henna on your hands
and welcomed you.

469
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,816
Those hands lit the lamp
on Father's grave.

470
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:33,553
Those hands now wave at the
Portuguese inviting them to your house.

471
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:38,954
They clap to applaud
Baliahasan's hanging.

472
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:43,028
Aren't you ashamed to say
you're a woman of Arackal?

473
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:48,464
And to call yourself a wife?
Harabichi.

474
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,069
Stop your sarcasm!

475
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:56,134
If I shut my mouth will a 100 canons
stop spitting fire at us?

476
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,342
Did we not offer them as much gold as they
wanted in return for Baliahasan's life?

477
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,344
They're scaring us.

478
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:07,049
Even our children are afraid.

479
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:12,659
Every woman here, every germ
of life within her, is afraid.

480
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,963
We should not allow that.

481
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,161
What will we do now?

482
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,840
I'll draw a moustache on you!

483
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:36,312
In our holy book our religion has
fixed certain punishments for all,

484
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,314
who commit atrocities.

485
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:43,219
Nobody can get excuse from those
punishments even if they are our brothers.

486
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:48,220
I, Asim Marikar, spoke to Baliahasan,
but he wouldn't listen.

487
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:57,429
He sank ships and killed the
Portuguese, our well-wishers.

488
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,338
To carry out his death sentence...

489
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:07,339
the great viceroy Vasco da Gama's Son,
Estavio has sailed to Kannur.

490
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:46,749
Estavio da Cama executes
his punishment...

491
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:52,860
on behalf of Dhuwan emperor
& Vasco da Gama.

492
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,795
Bring Baliahasan.

493
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,278
There's Baliahasan.

494
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,319
Friend.

495
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,658
Will you ask his pardon?

496
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,225
If you ask publicly for pardon...

497
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,161
l will appeal to these people,
in Allah's name...

498
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:42,598
to make your death a peaceful one.

499
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,900
I will ask pardon.

500
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,508
He says he will ask pardon.

501
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:57,791
Untie this knot.

502
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:04,959
You are stronger, you have more
men and weapons than us.

503
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,864
And still, you're afraid.

504
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:20,880
I ask your pardon because
I have let the Portuguese live.

505
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,653
I still haven't killed them all.
There are Baliahasans in this crowd.

506
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,079
Bolo Takbir!

507
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,060
Allahu Akbar!

508
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:35,528
My friend.

509
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,194
Rem ember your promise.

510
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,463
You said you'd take him back alive.

511
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,239
Let's not make him a corpse.

512
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,251
How dare you stab me from behind!

513
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,046
All the men Chenicheri sent
with us are traitors.

514
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,288
Don't wait for them. Come.

515
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:20,235
There's something happening here
that we don't know about.

516
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,978
Those who came with us
have some other aim.

517
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,282
Shut your mouth!

518
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,054
If he dies, his corpse won't walk.

519
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,957
You'll have to carry it yourself
say your prayers if you want to.

520
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:53,958
Don't open your mouth
for anything else.

521
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,833
So you'll take this man to Chirakkal
and keep your word.

522
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,168
Is the King of Chirakkal
your grandfather?

523
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:05,278
If we send this coppery head to Vasco,
it would be a good message.

524
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:11,876
If we keep the son,
the father will follow. Don't kill him.

525
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,789
Kelu is used to doing what he wants.

526
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,421
Listen to me.

527
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:23,725
The women and children in our village

528
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:28,726
must see him alive
and take revenge on him.

529
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:34,165
Your fervour's good!
But we have to cross this forest.

530
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:39,651
I know my way from Makkam Thara.
Till then, we have to manage.

531
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:53,889
There's seldom even a wick here.
Today, someone's lighted a lamp.

532
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,424
Anyway we're not lost. Come.

533
01:04:56,425 --> 01:05:00,762
We'll have to tie a rope around
his neck and drag him.

534
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:05,433
That girl said she'd be waiting
for you with a wedding chain...

535
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:10,372
if you go back with this burden.
Isn't that why you came with me?

536
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:14,981
What? You're saying I'm in love
with that haughty girl?

537
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:19,848
I'll dash a stone at his head like
I'd break coconuts in the temple!

538
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:24,491
If you think my words are worthless,
go your way, I'm not coming.

539
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,664
What am I without you?

540
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:46,650
There's no need for weapons
in a place of worship.

541
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,682
Who are you?

542
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,820
I came from the land of the
Aryans in a wooden ship, King.

543
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,420
He's no King, he's my friend.

544
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:06,067
Now Chirakkal trusts you
and Arackal respects you.

545
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:11,239
Go to Chirakkal. You will become
commanders of their army.

546
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,001
How?

547
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:16,575
The friend who's with you
is good and grateful.

548
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:25,490
Protect the country and the forest.
Don't let the Portuguese take over.

549
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:02,789
Movement! Movement
through the world's expanse.

550
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:07,998
There'll be a promise that life
will shine like a full moon.

551
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:13,532
Movement! Movement
through the world's expanse.

552
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:18,775
There'll be a promise that life
will shine like a full moon.

553
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:24,609
In the end, dreams will come true.

554
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:30,041
Movement! Movement
through the world's expanse.

555
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:35,746
There'll be a promise that life
will shine like a full moon.

556
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:40,933
In the end, dreams will come true.

557
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,558
Listen to the call that sleeps
within your heart.

558
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,828
There's a right way out
for everything that happens.

559
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,430
Let us search for it.

560
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:52,400
Go that way brave warriors!

561
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,869
Each life follows a different destiny.

562
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:59,870
And we can still change what we are saddled
with we can make dreams our weapons...

563
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:03,084
Let us achieve, O brave warriors!

564
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,629
Wake up and find your path...

565
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:25,333
Cleanse and sharpen your minds.

566
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:29,871
Learn the speed of chariots and be
armed with your glowing dreams.

567
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:34,872
Movement! Movement
through the world's expanse.

568
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:40,511
There'll be a promise that life
will shine like a full moon.

569
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:45,696
In the end, dreams will come true.

570
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:49,057
Listen to the call that sleeps
within your heart.

571
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,826
There's a right way out
for everything that happens.

572
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,294
Let us search for it.

573
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:57,038
Go that way, O warriors!

574
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,906
We can make dreams our weapons...

575
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:08,042
We'll see and achieve then,
O brave warriors!

576
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:13,043
O brave warriors!

577
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:32,173
All will come true.

578
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,010
A girl with the scent of pepper!

579
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,718
Is she real, or was it a dream?

580
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:51,958
It's clear we'll reach Chirakkal Vavvali,
you'll be an army chief!

581
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,889
And you'll be King?!

582
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,803
Will I have to bow down to you?

583
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,532
Friend! Isn't that what she told you?

584
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,802
All these dreams!

585
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:09,544
Come, Let's go.

586
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:17,014
Listen, you Portuguese fellow!
My Kelu's the King!

587
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:21,055
Look! A foreigner!

588
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:25,019
The man with a gun from Portugal.

589
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,933
The man with coppery hair.

590
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:37,443
Shut up your mouth.

591
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:54,979
The six-footer who crossed
the seven seas to come here.

592
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:04,021
Our King's gouged out
the lies in his grey eyes.

593
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,905
What a man he is, our King!

594
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:17,972
Is this Gama? I've seen him.

595
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,647
He has a beard. Who's this?

596
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,912
This is Gama, Estavio Gama.

597
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:28,616
The Viceroy's son. -He's Estappan.

598
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:33,617
The Estappan who gave us nightmares,
talking endlessly

599
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:39,490
about pepper and trade permits.
Let me look at your face.

600
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:44,666
This is Gama's seal. If it's his son,
let's announce him as

601
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:49,275
our special guest
and start negotiations with Cochin.

602
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:56,480
Bring the ceremonial sword.

603
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:14,532
A man of your word! You're my
Commander from now on King!

604
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,200
Chirakkal's new Kothuval.

605
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:22,770
Now Chirakkal Kelu Nayanar.

606
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,978
May the Goddess be with you.

607
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,445
Chirakkal Kothuval offers you
this on the tip of his sword.

608
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,426
This copper-head's little finger.

609
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:11,185
This will be our message
to viceroy Gama at Cochin.

610
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:15,828
Though his skin is white,
his blood is red.

611
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:19,327
Send it with this ring.

612
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:24,198
Our gift to Gama.
Slice up what's left.

613
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,373
Why kill this man?

614
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:36,616
Let him make the Portuguese
guns for Chirakkal.

615
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,955
Good. Bandage his wound.

616
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,415
It was wise to let Estappan live.

617
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,651
He'll be bait for the big fish!

618
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:20,988
I was wondering which of them
sent those men to betray us.

619
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,401
Now I'm sure it wasn't the King.

620
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,899
Betel leaves!

621
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,662
Here's a sight for the king's eyes.

622
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:06,663
Arab women. The half-caste converts
born in Chirakkal Unnichirutha's clan.

623
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,438
She was stolen from our pond.

624
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:14,008
They're from the women's
quarters of Arackal...

625
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,489
the family that tried
to shoot our Princess.

626
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,218
It was Maundy Thursday,
the Viceroy went to Cochin.

627
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,821
The Portuguese fought
until the Arackal Fort was ashes.

628
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:31,259
These women were fleeing to Tellicherry.
I brought them here.

629
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,297
Well done, Kaimal!

630
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:38,009
Did you give some of them away
to your friends?

631
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:47,638
Ah, she looks like a carving of our
grandmother, Unnichirutha! Who is she?

632
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,212
Ayesha!

633
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:55,349
Arakkal Ayesha!

634
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,817
I've heard of her.

635
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,119
The granddaughter of Asma Beebi.

636
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,989
The jewel of Arackal.

637
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,226
Shouldn't we welcome her
into the family, Chenicheri'?

638
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,495
She's a lioness.

639
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:10,565
We must give her a seat.

640
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,067
Yes, we must make her 'sit'!

641
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,207
But I don't see a suitable chair...

642
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:31,619
The left thigh for the Queen
and the right for the daughter.

643
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,254
Isn't that what they say?

644
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,791
Come, dear!

645
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,029
Come and sit down.

646
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:56,954
Touch one Chirakkal woman
and it will burn 100 Arackal women.

647
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:16,297
Good customs and courtesies.

648
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,905
My gratitude for the mercy
shown to the Arackal women.

649
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:27,619
By right, I should be Queen here.

650
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:31,278
But where's my place?

651
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:36,279
On the uncle's thigh or
in the nephew's chamber?

652
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,496
Clever girl!

653
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,563
This clan honours the custom
of a girl choosing her husband.

654
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:51,232
Tell the women inside to clean her up.

655
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:55,079
Be a Prince at least in your bedroom.

656
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:59,681
Mesmerize her.

657
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,723
Prepare a special bedroom
for the army commanders.

658
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,858
Nayanar, you're back from the war.

659
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,533
Take a silk mattress if you want one.

660
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,465
Is he gone?

661
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,911
Come, Ali.

662
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:30,004
Do you like scented chambers
and silk mattresses?

663
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:33,646
You want this one, or this one or.

664
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:37,885
Whether the war is at Arackal or
Chirakkal, it's the women who suffer.

665
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,791
Chenicheri told me specially
to look after you.

666
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:53,204
The missing finger still
seems to be there.

667
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,736
You've lost a lot of blood.

668
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,675
Don't move.

669
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:08,982
The news reached Gama at Cochin.

670
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,913
Viceroy there's fighting at Arackal...

671
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,249
Baliahasan was not hanged.

672
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,460
Estavio fell into enemy hands.

673
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:30,468
Vasco had overcome
many obstacles in his life.

674
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:35,437
He was confident of his son's return.

675
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:14,441
He won't say he can't do it.
When you're tired of the games...

676
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:18,379
in the bedroom, come out.
I'll be waiting.

677
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,121
I won't sleep.

678
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,186
Was that girl your younger sister?

679
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,691
You could have brought her in here.

680
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:04,330
Call her now,
before your life snuffs out!

681
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:11,101
Day will not break tomorrow
for any man here.

682
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,014
Pull her away!

683
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:58,045
Don't kill the girl. She's beautiful.

684
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:01,882
We should send her
to the brothel at Mannanar.

685
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:05,219
Don't, she'll enjoy it there.

686
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:13,139
Throw her to the public,
they'll tame her.

687
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:27,449
Bhanu, all you ever get
are leftovers. That's your fate.

688
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,621
Don't touch me!

689
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:51,930
Never come back
to this cursed land.

690
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:54,298
Go!

691
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,611
Go and survive somewhere.

692
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,447
Get up, it's time to go.

693
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,580
Where? I dreamt we were
bringing my mother here.

694
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:55,549
I didn't set out just
to enjoy being an army chief.

695
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,619
I know. We must capture Vasco.

696
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:02,022
But that's not so easy.

697
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:06,403
We have the bait here.
We'll take his son with us.

698
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:12,199
You have a horse now.
Stay on here as chief of the army

699
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:16,842
and you'll have a hundred.
Be intelligent. Stay here.

700
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:22,276
To bow to the King
and manage his affairs?

701
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:25,979
To overcome a pirate, a trader's
brain is better than a hunter's.

702
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:29,450
To do the right thing at the right.

703
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:33,287
Time is my way..

704
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:37,236
Come if you want to. We must
break open the prison and take him.

705
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:39,667
How?

706
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,651
Came to take a skirt you forgot?

707
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:07,421
I told you to go away.

708
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:10,424
Where can I go?

709
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:13,694
Wherever there's place,
wherever you like.

710
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:16,904
I like these people.
They're all I have left.

711
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:23,170
See what they've done to her,
that imbecile, your Prince.

712
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:24,673
He destroyed her.

713
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:32,779
Young or old, you don't care?

714
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,350
Cruel wretches!

715
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:45,421
Shouldn't have left a single man
in this palace alive.

716
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:51,628
Her reasons, our livelihoods:
They're different things.

717
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:56,403
You can never forgive those
who hurt women or children, Vavvali.

718
01:27:56,404 --> 01:28:01,217
So you've decided I won't live
to see my next birthday.

719
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:14,422
I must mend the harm
I did without meaning to.

720
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,492
You must create a diversion now.

721
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:21,667
A screen that will cover
the eyes of the guards.

722
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:29,708
Follow me without making a sound.

723
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,467
Estappan!

724
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:37,170
Estappan's opened
the door and come out!

725
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,206
Catch him!

726
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:16,506
Aim the target person by your right hand,
twist your right hand towards left...

727
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:19,479
Join both the right & left hands...

728
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:24,480
Twist your head, sit properly
& hold your hands tightly..

729
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,192
Strike him strongly.

730
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:32,434
Lord Allah! That's all.

731
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:35,589
You're a skilled duelist.

732
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:40,560
Estappan freed the Arackal women and killed the guards.
He was coming to kill you.

733
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:42,128
Where's your companion?

734
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:44,798
He's gone to Madayi.

735
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:46,833
That's how Estappan had his chance.

736
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:50,470
I never fail to reward those
who prove their worth.

737
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:52,672
You will supervise
my guard from now on.

738
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:54,243
Bring the sword of honour!

739
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:59,846
Estappan must be shifted
to Bhanu's custody.

740
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:04,847
The Muslims will attack
once their Women go back.

741
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:09,492
We may have many army heads.
But the king has only one head.

742
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:13,734
Chenicheri.

743
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:31,622
So, you've been given a sword.

744
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:40,253
There's tooth-powder in the house.

745
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:42,359
Use as much as you like.

746
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,812
Throw down your broomstick.
I've brought some women.

747
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:08,682
How did you cross
the river at this time?

748
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:10,450
I swam. The Goddess held my hand.

749
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:14,421
They're women from Arackal.
The little one's been mauled.

750
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:18,302
Look after them. Let them
stay here till their people come.

751
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:23,870
If they want to go, let them go.

752
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,091
Your fury hasn't abated?

753
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:28,862
Don't imagine you've done
something great.

754
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:34,506
I can't express gratitude
that I do not feel.

755
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:37,404
You're still furious?

756
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:40,682
That Prince's head
must be chopped off.

757
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:46,509
Arakkal Ayesha, who hacked
nine Portuguese men in pieces

758
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:48,185
to save her honour.

759
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:07,434
If it's true that you've
brought me, to a good place,

760
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:12,077
give me a weapon to protect
the women, who came along, trusting me.

761
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:43,280
I was given a Chirakkal sword
and I'm an army chief now.

762
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:47,640
Everything the girl
said is coming true.

763
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:48,847
Where are the women?

764
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:52,178
At Puthur.

765
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:54,147
Let them stay there for some time.

766
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:59,530
I asked the Headman
to make sure, no one sees them.

767
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:02,021
Where's Estavio?

768
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:04,290
I knocked him down.

769
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:09,798
Chenicheri had him confined
to Bhanu's room.

770
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:14,300
It's a mistake to have
let him out of our hands.

771
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,536
No, it's Allah's mercy.

772
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:21,537
The enemy you seek the
viceroy will come here to get him.

773
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:26,746
Until then, you please stay here.

774
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:29,215
Where is it?

775
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:31,856
The Urumi-sword is not at your Waist.

776
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:35,388
Did it fall off somewhere?

777
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:38,233
Or did you fall?

778
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,000
It will never lose its way.

779
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:44,567
It will come back to me.

780
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:50,032
So you gave it away
to a girl you've just met!

781
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:54,385
You've never allowed me
to touch it even once.

782
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:59,182
Did you give her only
the sword or your heart as well?

783
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:06,397
This is a problem.

784
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:13,603
Friend, it's a problem.

785
01:37:14,695 --> 01:37:15,901
What's the problem?

786
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:20,470
I said, what's the problem?

787
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:26,312
What problem does
my new army chief have?

788
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,353
This is another problem!

789
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:49,095
I have eyes that gleam that ignite
sparks each time, they flutter.

790
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:52,999
I have the beauty and grace
of the flowering poovarasu tree.

791
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,401
When he sees me walk like
the graceful swan...

792
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:56,669
the theyyam god
will abandon his crown.

793
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,140
Look at my beauty, like a silver cup
that's full to the brim.

794
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:05,511
I have eyes that gleam that ignite
sparks each time, they flutter.

795
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:09,649
I have the beauty and grace
of the flowering poovarasu tree.

796
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,784
When he sees me walk
like the graceful swan...

797
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,386
the theyyam god will
abandon his crown.

798
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:17,426
Look at my beauty, like a silver cup
that's full to the brim.

799
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:27,000
The elite of Kolathunad will
covet me when they see me...

800
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:30,536
and all the women
at home will tease me.

801
01:38:30,537 --> 01:38:35,441
The fragrance of my jasmine will intoxicate
the men of the Samoodiri's palace.

802
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:38,945
The clouds will come running
to line my eyes with kajal.

803
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:41,748
While the Pooram festival was
grandly celebrated...

804
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:44,717
While you did the war dance,
you didn't look at me.

805
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:48,689
Still you are my

806
01:38:49,723 --> 01:38:53,760
I have eyes that gleam that ignite
sparks each time, they flutter.

807
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:57,664
I have the beauty and grace of
the flowering poovarasu tree.

808
01:38:57,665 --> 01:39:00,133
When he sees me walk
like the graceful swan...

809
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:01,634
the theyyam god
will abandon his crown.

810
01:39:01,635 --> 01:39:05,777
Look at my beauty, like a silver cup
that's full to the brim.

811
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:27,527
You are like the bow of Kamadeva,
the God of Love.

812
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:30,941
Don't swing your sword at me.
I will become a flower.

813
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:35,768
All the girls in the queen's bathing
ghat will find out about us.

814
01:39:35,769 --> 01:39:39,372
Those who guard our land will
conduct our wedding.

815
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:44,373
I sang about so many things spoke
without words and yet you said nothing.

816
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:47,916
Still, you are my

817
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:54,053
I have eyes that gleam that ignite
sparks each time, they flutter.

818
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:58,191
I have the beauty and grace
of the flowering poovarasu tree.

819
01:39:58,192 --> 01:40:00,626
When he sees me walk
like the graceful swan...

820
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:02,072
the theyyam god will
abandon his crown.

821
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:10,239
Look at my beauty, like a silver cup
that's full to the brim.

822
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:27,193
Sit here.

823
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:42,268
For his brain to work, he must eat.

824
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:43,839
Give him food.

825
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:53,052
He wants to know
if you're trying to kill him.

826
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,623
He's suspicious.

827
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:10,074
Trust us.

828
01:41:21,975 --> 01:41:25,311
I just cut him down
to size in Portuguese.

829
01:41:25,312 --> 01:41:28,881
Bhanu, these people love to eat.

830
01:41:28,882 --> 01:41:33,853
If they go to Melindi or Mombasa,
they enjoy chameleons, lizards.

831
01:41:33,854 --> 01:41:35,922
They kill everyone, eat anything.

832
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:36,722
That's their way.

833
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:38,958
Does he understand our language?

834
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:41,294
He doesn't seem to.

835
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:46,295
But all those who came here after
his father spoke fluent Malayalam.

836
01:41:49,169 --> 01:41:52,939
I think he follows it.
Shall we find out?

837
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:53,973
How?

838
01:41:53,974 --> 01:41:58,616
This is his last meal. Velutha,
hang him when he's done.

839
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:02,116
He understands Malayalam perfectly.

840
01:42:07,921 --> 01:42:12,921
You're a poor actor. Don't try
to fool me. When the new regime

841
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:16,863
in your country became intolerable,
I was one of those

842
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:21,864
who requested Vasco da Gama
to come back to Kerala.

843
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:27,874
And now he likes Unniraman
of Cochin more than me.

844
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:31,477
I will save you, Estavio.

845
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:35,581
In return, you must make this prince,
Bhanuvikraman, an important man.

846
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:38,791
And Vasco must come here himself.

847
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,892
What did he say?

848
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:47,160
To free him.

849
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:50,233
That's dangerous.

850
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:53,232
Let the time come. Estavio

851
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:56,469
I'll do what is necessary then.

852
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:59,007
This prince is your friend.

853
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,020
'Bastard' means he
who does not have a father.

854
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:43,188
This sword refuses
to surrender to my hands.

855
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:48,988
It's not used to being
handled by strangers.

856
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:52,903
Disobedience is something
I prefer to subdue.

857
01:43:56,129 --> 01:43:58,598
This is not just a whiplash.

858
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:00,875
It's time for the journey.

859
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:07,509
You burnt our house.
Now you're sending me back?

860
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:12,318
Stop this two-faced game.

861
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,391
I'll take over as guard.

862
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:22,828
You're the reason
my home turned to ashes.

863
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:30,035
I didn't come there to kill Arab women.

864
01:44:31,999 --> 01:44:36,202
The father will gather
an army and come for his son.

865
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:38,274
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

866
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:43,784
The mercenaries of Chirakkal
can't defeat his army.

867
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:50,912
I did not hope for an army
when I set out on this hunt.

868
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:55,660
You're not confronting
just one man, the Viceroy.

869
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:02,269
War is something to win not to fear.

870
01:45:04,331 --> 01:45:06,072
Put aside your arrogance.

871
01:45:06,733 --> 01:45:11,733
I've no army, I've only my word
to give you. Am ass strength.

872
01:45:14,274 --> 01:45:19,274
Go to the villages, gather those
who have fire within them.

873
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:23,516
Ayesha is with you as well.

874
01:45:23,517 --> 01:45:28,330
There are people in the Arackal
army who are loyal to me.

875
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:33,531
Why give me help I did not seek?

876
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:42,076
I am also with Kothuval's son
on his journey.

877
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:51,877
Where do you go with your force?
Not with my force.

878
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,646
To Madai along with my friend.

879
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:59,757
I'm going to start a good matter punishing
Payanbai & meeting Madai soldiers.

880
01:46:00,387 --> 01:46:05,091
Ifs very tough.
You always roaming with your friend.

881
01:46:05,092 --> 01:46:06,759
Friendi's words are right.

882
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,961
If we don't say anything to them,
whom shouldn't we say..

883
01:46:08,962 --> 01:46:11,130
We need not hear the
unwanted suggestions.

884
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:12,798
I wanted to tell you a thing.

885
01:46:12,799 --> 01:46:14,166
What's that?

886
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:16,936
He's my friend from my childhood.

887
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:20,206
He's like dragonfly,
which dies immediately if we harm it.

888
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:25,077
Whoever may say anything.
He will be honest. I'll be there with him.

889
01:46:25,078 --> 01:46:30,078
I am also there with you. Can you
take me also to your destination?

890
01:46:31,585 --> 01:46:36,585
Queen should go along with the king. Flight?
-Will you become a king, right? - Princess.

891
01:46:36,757 --> 01:46:41,327
King is on the way.
Don't torture us by singing here.

892
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:43,796
King will be there only
if there is his kingdom. Flight?

893
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:48,974
Friend has planned to gather
some people & question you directly

894
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:53,144
I'll come from my journey & tell you
that when you'd come with me.

895
01:47:01,481 --> 01:47:05,418
Keezha Nayanar! -You man!

896
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:10,419
Keezha Nayanar didn't go to Puthur
cowardly & not to hide somewhere.

897
01:47:11,992 --> 01:47:15,294
To ask credit. -King has gone
for that only. Right?

898
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:16,729
He will definitely arrange it.

899
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:19,870
Why did you ask credit
for us, Nayanar?

900
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:24,303
We will give you the crops alone
of Madha Nayakar.

901
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:29,549
You man! Shout louder!
Let our people come here.

902
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:41,450
Come on! Come on!
We didn't come here to ask money.

903
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:45,057
To ask man power for our force.

904
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:50,058
We have a great force to redeem
our Kozhikodu from our enemies.

905
01:47:56,169 --> 01:47:58,537
We have our warriors
to destroy our enemies.

906
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:02,208
I saw my siblings suffer
for they want to kill me...

907
01:48:02,209 --> 01:48:05,744
Puthur soldiers couldn't help me.

908
01:48:05,745 --> 01:48:09,482
When they killed
Thalachangodu dragging his hair...

909
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,650
Nobody supported us getting
bribe from your king.

910
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:14,086
Then they ceased our group.

911
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:16,956
Somebody laughed louder at that time.

912
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:21,167
Some other people died
in prison. Why?

913
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:27,032
To cross our seas, we need permits.

914
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:28,501
Why should we?

915
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:33,502
When we send people to ask
they come back as corpses.

916
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:36,408
This is becoming
a routine in every part.

917
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:39,645
So Kelu has come
to ask for a favour.

918
01:48:39,646 --> 01:48:43,048
The Portuguese have nearly
1000 people and we here

919
01:48:43,049 --> 01:48:45,284
have 5 men for each one of them.

920
01:48:45,285 --> 01:48:47,186
I was born on this soil.

921
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:50,964
I ask this soil to loan me its men.

922
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:57,129
Doesn't he know that if you don't
obey the Portuguese, they'll hang you?

923
01:48:57,130 --> 01:49:01,237
True, I sing for wages, but
I get enough to eat and be happy.

924
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:08,447
Come with me, all of you
who are strong and brave.

925
01:49:12,012 --> 01:49:19,021
Give me a 1000 hands to go
to war with the Portuguese.

926
01:49:23,823 --> 01:49:31,674
We don't need this hang-pole
that pierces our Mother earth's chest.

927
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:48,108
History must never say that
this animal was a burden to me.

928
01:50:54,714 --> 01:50:56,284
Go on drawing.

929
01:50:58,818 --> 01:51:01,799
Hold me, I'm coming down.

930
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:03,756
My back.

931
01:51:03,757 --> 01:51:06,492
These people are from Kodungallur...

932
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:09,261
Syrians who are suffering because
they opposed the Portuguese.

933
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:13,599
They'd be glad if you give them
an opportunity to do trade with us.

934
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,068
Madhevos, Yusuf.

935
01:51:16,069 --> 01:51:19,872
If you help us, King,
We will always remember you.

936
01:51:19,873 --> 01:51:21,874
What's the point of remembering?

937
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:25,220
If we get a discount on taxes, we'll bring
you your share of the profits.

938
01:51:28,248 --> 01:51:30,482
Shouldn't I have a word
with Chenicheri?

939
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:36,957
No King should seek another's help
if he feels he's doing the right thing.

940
01:51:40,894 --> 01:51:42,728
Go and see the officials.

941
01:51:42,729 --> 01:51:43,867
Thank you, King.

942
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:52,547
There's something I have to tell you.

943
01:51:53,173 --> 01:51:58,173
The person who broke open the cell
to free the Arackal women was me.

944
01:51:58,211 --> 01:51:58,911
Kelu!

945
01:51:58,912 --> 01:52:01,747
They are safe now, at Puthur.

946
01:52:01,748 --> 01:52:03,949
That was wrong, King.

947
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:07,219
You must make amends for your mistake.

948
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:11,223
The people at Arackal
are our enemies, Kelu.

949
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:13,258
-Our prestige -What prestige?

950
01:52:13,259 --> 01:52:17,229
For banishing your sister
because a Muslim touched her

951
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:22,000
during a quarrel about
the partition of the property?

952
01:52:22,001 --> 01:52:25,637
Or for your fear that
Cheraman Perumal would...

953
01:52:25,638 --> 01:52:27,840
hand your entire land over to Islam?

954
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:30,442
Enough of that.

955
01:52:30,443 --> 01:52:34,546
Christians, Muslims,
must all stand with us now.

956
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:35,614
The Arackal girl.

957
01:52:35,615 --> 01:52:38,357
We've already spoken about it.

958
01:52:57,871 --> 01:53:01,842
Don't touch the ground.
Carefully, attentively...

959
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:07,786
Imagine he's a wild boar that
has come to destroy your crops.

960
01:53:08,515 --> 01:53:10,188
A wild boar.

961
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:38,887
Betel leaves.

962
01:53:40,713 --> 01:53:43,749
You seem overcome by emotion.

963
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:45,517
Yes, it's emotion.

964
01:53:45,518 --> 01:53:49,125
The emotion of joy.

965
01:53:49,722 --> 01:53:53,192
Once I realized that
kingship is not easy

966
01:53:53,193 --> 01:53:56,662
I never enjoyed peace of mind.

967
01:53:56,663 --> 01:54:00,566
Now that I have
two strong young men

968
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:04,369
to look after
my affairs, is a satisfaction.

969
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:09,376
Now I feel that I'm a King.

970
01:54:12,278 --> 01:54:16,114
When the scaffolds the Portuguese
had put up were uprooted

971
01:54:16,115 --> 01:54:20,222
the fear in people's
hearts came out with them.

972
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:27,295
They had a leader now
to unite them, Kelu.

973
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:42,770
Your pupils are pale,
your eyes have a reddish tinge.

974
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:47,713
By the time you're King,
you'll be blind, like Dhritarashtra.

975
01:54:47,714 --> 01:54:49,314
Who is Dhritarashtra?

976
01:54:49,315 --> 01:54:50,682
The King of the Kauravas.

977
01:54:50,683 --> 01:54:54,253
I do everything
the King tells me, and yet.

978
01:54:54,254 --> 01:54:59,363
That's why I say, the way
forward is the Portuguese way.

979
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:09,134
I have received bad news
from Puther Kelu...

980
01:55:09,135 --> 01:55:14,135
and Ali are running around,
gathering people.

981
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:19,811
They want to amass a huge army.

982
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:24,812
Their aim is to attain
the Chirakkal throne.

983
01:55:25,652 --> 01:55:29,031
I what should I do?

984
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:35,990
The throne...is not a low-legged bed.

985
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:41,129
You must use the imprisoned
Estavio to get to Vasco da Gama...

986
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:46,812
and I then climb up through
Vasco to the position of King.

987
01:56:05,224 --> 01:56:08,560
This time, the gift was
your son's little finger.

988
01:56:08,561 --> 01:56:15,137
Next time you send the army
they'll send his head.

989
01:56:25,211 --> 01:56:30,211
Asim is coming in the guise
of a Muslim devotee.

990
01:56:30,883 --> 01:56:34,990
Vasco is sending troops
to rescue Estappan.

991
01:56:35,688 --> 01:56:40,535
Those pigs will come
and eat your crops.

992
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:56,004
Vasco knew that if he himself led
the army that would endanger his son.

993
01:56:56,976 --> 01:56:59,177
So, he sent trusted
Portuguese warriors...

994
01:56:59,178 --> 01:57:05,288
to rescue Estavio, his son
along with some local warriors.

995
01:59:13,112 --> 01:59:18,112
Did you hear the village army
sing a funeral dirge?

996
01:59:18,618 --> 01:59:24,330
Go and tell them that the ritual
of uprooting has started a folk song.

997
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:47,608
Mother! Won't our suffers go off?

998
01:59:51,217 --> 01:59:56,217
Our excitements & our happiness...

999
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:05,026
Do you know about our peaceful life
& delicious cooking, you girl?

1000
02:00:15,942 --> 02:00:25,590
Dear! Do you know
those things, you girl?

1001
02:00:58,651 --> 02:01:03,651
Who are you?

1002
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:54,439
Like the thundering waves...

1003
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:58,910
Like flying embers...

1004
02:01:58,911 --> 02:02:03,848
You come like the fiery ethira' dancer.

1005
02:02:03,849 --> 02:02:08,486
The one who holds within him
the completeness of the arts.

1006
02:02:08,487 --> 02:02:13,158
Those closely entwined tresses
have so much grace and beauty.

1007
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:17,829
What lies in those eyes, where
waves splash, is it lust or compassion?

1008
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:21,700
Is it a dream or a tender shoot?

1009
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:24,102
Is it fire or words?

1010
02:02:24,103 --> 02:02:26,504
Will you not tell me?

1011
02:02:26,505 --> 02:02:28,505
Who are you?

1012
02:02:35,881 --> 02:02:39,951
Like the thundering waves...

1013
02:02:39,952 --> 02:02:44,489
Like flying embers...

1014
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:49,394
You come like the fiery ethira' dancer.

1015
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:53,775
The one who holds within him
the completeness of the arts.

1016
02:03:16,355 --> 02:03:20,959
In the night-dark flow
of your wet tresses...

1017
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,806
you wear a crescent moon.

1018
02:03:25,264 --> 02:03:30,068
In the unleashed blade
of the urumi-sword...

1019
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:33,983
you are the gleam of gold.

1020
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:42,755
In the Ezhimala hills
and the Elamala hills...

1021
02:03:43,716 --> 02:03:48,716
You unfurl a peacock
that merges into my dream.

1022
02:03:52,858 --> 02:03:57,858
You become the body
of an un-quenched thirst.

1023
02:03:57,863 --> 02:03:59,863
Who are you?

1024
02:04:11,243 --> 02:04:14,179
From the body
which is getting spoiled...

1025
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:19,180
To the devil sailor named Vasco,
who is going to die...

1026
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:27,329
Kelu & his country people
expected Vasco's death.

1027
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:39,671
It's time for action.

1028
02:04:39,672 --> 02:04:43,741
Ali and Kelu have overcome the King.

1029
02:04:43,742 --> 02:04:48,742
Your father, Vasco da Gama,
is sitting idle in Cochin.

1030
02:04:50,182 --> 02:04:52,856
I'm sending the Crown Prince
himself to Vasco with the news.

1031
02:05:10,135 --> 02:05:13,514
'Vao' in Portuguese means
'Go' in Malayalam!

1032
02:06:26,712 --> 02:06:31,712
A message from Kolathunad,
for the first time after the riots.

1033
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:34,758
A dwarf...?

1034
02:06:36,355 --> 02:06:38,089
What Chenicheri said was right.

1035
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:40,900
Your every word is foolish.

1036
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:43,972
Chirakkal Bhanuvikraman.

1037
02:06:44,863 --> 02:06:46,397
Sit down.

1038
02:06:46,398 --> 02:06:49,200
He's not yet become King.
He's the Crown Prince.

1039
02:06:49,201 --> 02:06:53,137
You look the part. It wouldn't be
wrong to call you King.

1040
02:06:53,138 --> 02:06:55,673
Gama is on the warpath.

1041
02:06:55,674 --> 02:06:59,744
He caught a fever in Goa
and has become very weak.

1042
02:06:59,745 --> 02:07:04,854
And he's worried about his son.
Who thought this would happen?

1043
02:07:05,451 --> 02:07:06,584
Estavio

1044
02:07:06,585 --> 02:07:11,585
Chenicheri Kurup is very clever.
He didn't come himself because

1045
02:07:13,525 --> 02:07:16,327
he knew he'd never go back.

1046
02:07:16,328 --> 02:07:18,763
I'll explain things to this fellow.

1047
02:07:18,764 --> 02:07:22,268
I'll tell him what to do
and how to do it.

1048
02:07:23,369 --> 02:07:26,104
Tell him, why you've come.

1049
02:07:26,105 --> 02:07:28,573
The trade permit trade permit.

1050
02:07:28,574 --> 02:07:29,941
Trade permit?

1051
02:07:29,942 --> 02:07:32,149
Yes.

1052
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:23,167
There's a person outside. You can go.

1053
02:08:40,045 --> 02:08:44,182
Your father will never
touch Opium again.

1054
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:49,183
Good! The Goddess's face
will become clear again.

1055
02:08:51,123 --> 02:08:56,129
There'll soon be a wedding chain
around your neck.

1056
02:08:57,730 --> 02:09:00,176
You'll make me hate this world?

1057
02:09:00,799 --> 02:09:03,668
So you want to retire, do you?

1058
02:09:03,669 --> 02:09:08,243
I have a warrior in mind.

1059
02:09:11,376 --> 02:09:13,444
Go and put on these new clothes.

1060
02:09:13,445 --> 02:09:17,348
When you come back wearing them,
I'll tell you who it is.

1061
02:09:17,349 --> 02:09:20,592
I have someone in mind too.

1062
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:24,924
Only clothes - no jewels?

1063
02:09:25,691 --> 02:09:27,432
Off with you!

1064
02:09:49,281 --> 02:09:52,183
Why didn't you tell me
you were going on a journey?

1065
02:09:52,184 --> 02:09:54,552
Danger lurks everywhere now.

1066
02:09:54,553 --> 02:09:56,254
Look at this.

1067
02:09:56,255 --> 02:09:59,791
For 4 years, you've been begging
the Portuguese for a trade permit.

1068
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:03,035
I managed to get it in just 4 days!

1069
02:10:04,062 --> 02:10:06,064
What do you have to say now?

1070
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:19,422
Who has the right to levy taxes
on the God-given expanse of the sea?

1071
02:10:20,579 --> 02:10:24,527
Whose feet did you fall at?

1072
02:10:25,984 --> 02:10:29,295
Stuff it back in the throat
of whoever gave it to you.

1073
02:10:44,136 --> 02:10:47,117
See that your index
finger does not tremble.

1074
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:50,144
Chenicheri...

1075
02:11:11,797 --> 02:11:13,431
Those eyes...

1076
02:11:13,432 --> 02:11:15,844
Chenicheri, close those eyes.

1077
02:12:19,998 --> 02:12:23,104
We'd not allow European force
to cross our country...

1078
02:12:28,507 --> 02:12:31,175
Estappan has escaped.

1079
02:12:31,176 --> 02:12:32,780
And the King

1080
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:57,234
Estavio has escaped.

1081
02:12:57,235 --> 02:12:59,937
Now Gama will come with his arm y.

1082
02:12:59,938 --> 02:13:04,938
The late King would have given
orders to prepare for war.

1083
02:13:07,546 --> 02:13:09,513
Tell the chieftains.

1084
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:13,184
The Chirakkal army will
do take orders from me.

1085
02:13:13,185 --> 02:13:15,052
They will not be with you.

1086
02:13:15,053 --> 02:13:20,053
You, your army and Kurup
who feeds you Opium.

1087
02:13:22,494 --> 02:13:24,895
Do what you want?

1088
02:13:24,896 --> 02:13:27,274
You dare talk back to the King?

1089
02:13:27,866 --> 02:13:29,937
Sit down on that throne, Bhanu.

1090
02:13:35,907 --> 02:13:40,907
First teach him the basics of monarchy
before he plays the King's role.

1091
02:13:43,749 --> 02:13:47,918
You want to fight the Portuguese?

1092
02:13:47,919 --> 02:13:50,755
That is real treason.

1093
02:13:50,756 --> 02:13:55,756
You want poor folk who are used to tilling
the land to fight the Portuguese army.

1094
02:13:59,564 --> 02:14:01,132
You're selfish!

1095
02:14:01,133 --> 02:14:05,604
Your duty to a King is to protect
his people, not shed their blood.

1096
02:14:07,706 --> 02:14:12,706
There's a scheming,
greedy woman in you.

1097
02:14:16,848 --> 02:14:23,663
Authority over the Lakshadweep
Islands and a title.

1098
02:14:26,358 --> 02:14:30,394
That's the bait the Portuguese
hold against you.

1099
02:14:30,395 --> 02:14:34,999
My father once asked you to support him
and fight for our people.

1100
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:40,000
You handed him over
to the Portuguese instead...

1101
02:14:40,138 --> 02:14:42,339
My father, Chirakkal Kothuval
you betrayed him.

1102
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,478
Kothuval!

1103
02:14:45,777 --> 02:14:48,045
If it was only my self-interest,

1104
02:14:48,046 --> 02:14:51,721
then your head would
have been on my lap.

1105
02:14:52,751 --> 02:14:54,652
Open your eyes.

1106
02:14:54,653 --> 02:14:59,090
There's only one enemy.

1107
02:14:59,091 --> 02:15:04,091
22 years ago, my father ignited
a spark in my heart, with which.

1108
02:15:05,630 --> 02:15:12,275
I swore to light a pyre
for the Viceroy

1109
02:15:53,712 --> 02:15:54,918
Estavio.

1110
02:16:33,718 --> 02:16:35,052
Princess!

1111
02:16:35,053 --> 02:16:39,190
The moment you chose to open
my door was not auspicious.

1112
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:40,925
The King is gone.

1113
02:16:40,926 --> 02:16:45,496
I have only one thing to say
without pomp or ceremony,

1114
02:16:45,497 --> 02:16:47,932
you must come out
of this sad room now.

1115
02:16:47,933 --> 02:16:51,602
Our country needs its Princess.

1116
02:16:51,603 --> 02:16:56,643
I can feel my father's agony.

1117
02:17:00,145 --> 02:17:05,145
Before his pyre turns to ashes
the army will reach the palace.

1118
02:17:05,951 --> 02:17:09,091
Don't be foolish and allow their
guns to come up to this door.

1119
02:17:11,022 --> 02:17:14,799
Knowingly don't be
a witness to the wrongs.

1120
02:17:16,595 --> 02:17:21,298
I know who killed my father and why...

1121
02:17:21,299 --> 02:17:28,308
I cringe that the blood that flows
in his veins is the same as mine...

1122
02:17:32,143 --> 02:17:37,143
Yes, I will leave this palace
without pomp or ceremony

1123
02:17:39,684 --> 02:17:44,684
I will leave this palace that will
bow down to the Portuguese...

1124
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:48,733
and come to your village.

1125
02:18:02,807 --> 02:18:12,353
I will be with you, Princess,
wherever you go.

1126
02:18:25,697 --> 02:18:28,799
From now on, that's all I want to dedicate
myself to Puthur is your palace now.

1127
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:33,800
We didn't have the time, Princess,
to prepare a welcome for you.

1128
02:18:34,472 --> 02:18:36,440
I have not left home.

1129
02:18:36,441 --> 02:18:39,479
I have come home.

1130
02:18:41,746 --> 02:18:46,183
We'll surround them at the spot
where the viceroy arrives.

1131
02:18:46,184 --> 02:18:50,291
Look, a 100 people
are digging the moat.

1132
02:18:53,992 --> 02:19:03,709
Get the women and children ready
to go north to the mountains.

1133
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:15,155
Here, a letter. The King will know
who sent it and what to do.

1134
02:19:17,916 --> 02:19:21,295
As always, the woman retreats.

1135
02:19:24,723 --> 02:19:29,723
No, you will lead them.

1136
02:19:29,728 --> 02:19:34,198
You will safeguard the mothers

1137
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:41,344
who will give us a whole
new generation of warriors.

1138
02:19:43,274 --> 02:19:47,347
Why did you choose me
for this mission?

1139
02:19:52,417 --> 02:19:59,528
If I know you are there, far away,
I will come back just for you.

1140
02:20:04,662 --> 02:20:09,662
We have fresh garlands
for the new stage.

1141
02:20:18,943 --> 02:20:23,943
And the scene is set for us.

1142
02:20:32,557 --> 02:20:37,557
We hold our love for this
soil close to our hearts.

1143
02:20:46,805 --> 02:20:51,805
And in the abode we've made,
no one is a stranger.

1144
02:21:00,952 --> 02:21:05,952
Our souls and our lives
are linked to our dreams...

1145
02:21:06,257 --> 02:21:11,257
this is what the wise ones
have always taught us.

1146
02:22:27,472 --> 02:22:29,940
There are many changes, Viceroy.

1147
02:22:29,941 --> 02:22:32,643
Temples have become taverns.

1148
02:22:32,644 --> 02:22:35,546
Enough spaces have been created...

1149
02:22:35,547 --> 02:22:37,781
for the Portuguese
cannons to be placed.

1150
02:22:37,782 --> 02:22:42,782
Pepper traders compete in every
port as for that garrulous King...

1151
02:22:44,789 --> 02:22:47,190
we did away with him.

1152
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:49,393
Rather, Bhanu helped.

1153
02:22:49,394 --> 02:22:54,394
Here he is, the King.

1154
02:22:55,400 --> 02:23:00,400
All that this Minister, Kurup wishes
for is the affection of Portugal.

1155
02:23:00,572 --> 02:23:01,573
Affection...

1156
02:23:12,483 --> 02:23:15,953
Estappan, my friend.

1157
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:47,084
News as Dhuwan, the new king of
Portugal, has saved his promise.

1158
02:23:47,085 --> 02:23:51,288
Minister Kuruppu is the Government
General of lakh islands hereafter.

1159
02:23:51,289 --> 02:23:56,289
Your contract of dividing the tax amount of
ships those comes for all the directions...

1160
02:24:00,765 --> 02:24:03,700
Hey Chakrathali Hasim Pakir!

1161
02:24:03,701 --> 02:24:07,204
You've become a great man as this
Chenacheli Kuruppan's broad-mind.

1162
02:24:07,205 --> 02:24:09,506
If I get this reward now...

1163
02:24:09,507 --> 02:24:14,507
I have the intelligence to think
whether I can go to lakh islands or prison.

1164
02:24:17,949 --> 02:24:22,185
Kuruppu is going to give up his
role that he played until now.

1165
02:24:22,186 --> 02:24:27,186
I have 2 eyes, which wants to redeem
my country from European forces.

1166
02:24:27,625 --> 02:24:30,902
I won't get this reward to spoil that.

1167
02:24:34,032 --> 02:24:38,640
Estavio! I'm a prestigious person.

1168
02:25:06,931 --> 02:25:09,900
Don't prevent anyone from leaving.

1169
02:25:09,901 --> 02:25:14,901
People have gathered
at the appointed spots.

1170
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:21,349
Before the war starts,
talk to them to give them courage.

1171
02:25:21,946 --> 02:25:25,689
We've talked enough. Now for deeds.

1172
02:25:27,618 --> 02:25:29,791
The Chirakkal army is approaching.

1173
02:26:03,688 --> 02:26:07,295
So Kaimal, no one with you
when you switched sides?

1174
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:16,776
Have you seen the deep pit
in which to bury men like you?

1175
02:28:55,326 --> 02:28:58,161
Standing shoulder to shoulder,
you gave of your best

1176
02:28:58,162 --> 02:29:00,463
your weapons in tune
with your hearts.

1177
02:29:00,464 --> 02:29:03,673
Now, to the palace.

1178
02:29:35,333 --> 02:29:36,539
Friend!

1179
02:29:37,535 --> 02:29:40,370
Vavvali, my friend.

1180
02:29:40,371 --> 02:29:42,639
Vavvali, it's nothing.

1181
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:46,053
Vavvali, nothing's happened to you.

1182
02:29:46,377 --> 02:29:50,113
Friend! Nothing... Close your mouth.

1183
02:29:50,114 --> 02:29:53,721
Move... -Move. -Be careful.

1184
02:29:54,485 --> 02:29:56,431
Nothing, Vavvali.

1185
02:29:58,456 --> 02:30:00,857
Go, my friend.

1186
02:30:00,858 --> 02:30:03,964
Achieve what you dared.

1187
02:30:05,763 --> 02:30:10,133
Tomorrow, no one will remember Vavvali.

1188
02:30:10,134 --> 02:30:14,971
Maybe no one will praise Kelu.

1189
02:30:14,972 --> 02:30:19,972
But give me your word that
the world will never glorify Vasco.

1190
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:27,730
No, no.

1191
02:30:36,527 --> 02:30:40,196
You are my brother and protector.

1192
02:30:40,197 --> 02:30:44,111
Before I cut his throat,
you should come.

1193
02:30:44,869 --> 02:30:48,612
I'll wait for you.

1194
02:31:15,499 --> 02:31:18,309
Viceroy! The village army has come.

1195
02:41:33,083 --> 02:41:35,188
What Ali said became true.

1196
02:41:35,719 --> 02:41:41,067
History forgot Kelu and
the world praised Vasco.

1197
02:41:41,558 --> 02:41:46,558
Other countries followed the
Portuguese 400 years of servitude...

1198
02:41:48,198 --> 02:41:52,578
until a Gandhi liberated us.

1199
02:41:53,837 --> 02:41:56,005
The spaces of war have shifted.

1200
02:41:56,006 --> 02:41:57,540
It's here now.

1201
02:41:57,541 --> 02:42:01,343
We stand before
the weapon that is money.

1202
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:07,351
The decision is yours to make
and the responsibility of this as well.

1203
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:31,751
There's drumming in the north
while we dance in the south...

1204
02:42:34,044 --> 02:42:35,077
Friend!

1205
02:42:35,078 --> 02:42:39,618
These people are harmless,
nothing like what we feared.

1206
02:43:08,745 --> 02:43:11,814
It was along and tiring journey.

1207
02:43:11,815 --> 02:43:14,150
What's the evening programme?

1208
02:43:14,151 --> 02:43:16,919
A meeting with the landowner,
Krishnadas...

1209
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:19,799
and Nirvana, the mining corporation.

1210
02:43:23,093 --> 02:43:26,162
Sir, if you plant one tree,
will it become a forest?

1211
02:43:26,163 --> 02:43:29,098
All the trees I planted till now
have become forests.

1212
02:43:29,099 --> 02:43:32,168
Sir, considering the debates
on mining in Orissa

1213
02:43:32,169 --> 02:43:36,083
what's your personal opinion
about this enterprise in Kerala?

1214
02:43:38,642 --> 02:43:42,745
You're asking whether I have
shares in the company, Nirvana.

1215
02:43:42,746 --> 02:43:45,727
No, I don't.
It is an international consortium.

1216
02:43:53,824 --> 02:43:55,360
Blood!

1217
02:43:57,227 --> 02:44:00,174
Be positive, it's a good omen. Sign.

1218
02:44:18,949 --> 02:44:23,385
This project will be located
on a vast portion of land

1219
02:44:23,386 --> 02:44:27,122
that is being sold willingly
by Krishnadas with your support

1220
02:44:27,123 --> 02:44:31,538
this will become
one of India's best mining cities.

1221
02:44:36,733 --> 02:44:39,145
I have to think about it again.

1222
02:44:40,837 --> 02:44:42,817
I said, I have to give it
some more thought.

1223
02:44:44,140 --> 02:44:47,676
Satellite cities,
opportunities for employment.

1224
02:44:47,677 --> 02:44:49,778
IT parks.
The media must understand that

1225
02:44:49,779 --> 02:44:51,680
I am not against environmental issues.

1226
02:44:51,681 --> 02:44:54,059
I am against fake
environmental activists.

1227
02:45:14,771 --> 02:45:17,039
I cannot sell.

1228
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,383
Brother!

1229
02:45:24,247 --> 02:45:29,247
I had no sentiments at all
for the soil I was born on

1230
02:45:29,419 --> 02:45:32,121
until I arrived here.

1231
02:45:32,122 --> 02:45:36,659
I came here, met some people and heard

1232
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:41,660
of the dream that those
who lived and died on this soil had.

1233
02:45:41,665 --> 02:45:45,968
That dream is now mine as well,
I want to try once more...

1234
02:45:45,969 --> 02:45:51,214
and see if we can make
that dream come true.

1235
02:46:24,574 --> 02:46:27,077
Be careful, that's an urumi-sword.

1236
02:47:08,151 --> 02:47:15,160
If I know you are there, far away,
I will come back, just for you.
