1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,600
Heavy traffic reported ahead.

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,680
Boss, excuse me, boss.

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,320
Hey, what is it?

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,360
What happened to
my bank loan, sir?

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
Are you a the CEO of the
bank or I am IPL teams owner

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,560
that I you would be granted the
loan as soon as you ask for it?

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,600
You just joined the
channel ten days back.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,240
Loan.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,360
In two hundred meters exit left.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,120
How long? We are here
sir, we are here.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,600
I don't why that guy is said thirty
eight rupees per day is sufficient.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,240
And on this sunny day why
did they give us this duty.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,960
And with the Google maps you are taking
me all around in search of Netaji.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
Hey why did you bring
us to dead end?

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,800
It said in hundred meters turn
left sir. And we ended up here.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,120
You either listen to Google
maps or Shreya Gosla's songs.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
If you try to listen to
both, this how we get lost.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,200
Turn the vehicle. In one kilometer at
the roundabout take the second exit.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,600
Boss! Yes.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,880
If you don't mind I would like
to say something. Tell me.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,136
This song is not sung
by Shreya Gosala.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,600
Shut up. You don't try to
show off your knowledge.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,920
You don't know how to take
me to the destination

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,240
but you are able to show off.
Move!

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,560
Continue straight.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,840
I will skin you alive,

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,840
if any other channel
fellow reaches before us.

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,560
It said one kilometer a
little while ago right?

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,880
Did you over shoot?

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,320
You have reached
your destination.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
Hey, hey, there is the
BOARD: Nethaji Nagar.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,000
Get off, get off. Just
stop a little ahead. Okay.

33
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,539
Sir, ready sir.

34
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,250
Hey, what ready so fast?

35
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,570
Wait for a while guys.

36
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,730
My wife is already making a mess
that I'm not seen well in TV.

37
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,410
Ready.

38
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:26,354
Our Finance Minister Mr. Nagendra
supporting the decision of planning

39
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,472
38 rupees per dayare
enough for a common man

40
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:31,970
to lead life in India
is creating havoc.

41
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:35,249
We will now ask his constituency
Netaji Nagar public about

42
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:36,309
what they feel on this.

43
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,165
Fast, girls are coming. We
shall ask them the questions.

44
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:45,459
Hey, camera Camera come on here.

45
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,130
I am Netaji Nagar
Celebrity, ask me answer.

46
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:49,890
Ready? Ready.

47
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:54,250
Madam, your MLA says 38 rupees a day
are enough for a common man to live.

48
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,047
What's your response about this?

49
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,897
Pension, sir? It isn't
coming, will you give?

50
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:01,675
Nagendra doesn't say
anything just like that.

51
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,255
We have full confidence on him.

52
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:03,940
Hey cut it, cut it.

53
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,440
Who the man carrying the life
burden every second will know

54
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:07,896
the value of problems
and about the expenses.

55
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
When we think, what's
wrong in what he said?

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,757
We should make it a controversy.

57
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:13,403
Who'd watch if we say like this?
One should scold.

58
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,495
Hey, which idiot said that?

59
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:20,410
Hello boss, 30 rupees for the 90 a
night and the stuff costs 10 rupees.

60
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,890
It totals to 40 rupees. If that is over
in the night, what about the morning?

61
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,226
Hey, you shouldn't show
all these in camera.

62
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,986
No idea about him, but I'll definitely
vote if his son contests the election.

63
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,770
Why so?

64
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,369
Yes, he looks so handsome.

65
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:31,810
Oh, is she that type?

66
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,039
Do you know that everything
has a rate here?

67
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:36,333
Our politicians have made
this a habit. Hey, give 500.

68
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:38,744
I spend 50 rupees daily
for just my leaves.

69
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:43,377
Leaving aside 38 or 50, it is better
that we all bring down our expenses.

70
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:44,586
Scold well. If so, can't we say?

71
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,786
Hey, that's given to me.
Come on, scold guys.

72
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,210
Hey, they gave me.

73
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:47,255
Hey, they gave it to me.

74
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:48,451
You have seen it, right Kishore?

75
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:52,138
Mr. Nagendra's fans and the public are
fighting due to the 38 rupees issue.

76
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:54,890
Looking it this, I feel the
issue doesn't seem to settle.

77
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:57,437
Though I got this shot
directly, indirectly we can

78
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,576
understand that they are opposing
the statement of Mr Nagendra.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,240
Yesterday you charged
me another rate.

80
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:05,416
Madam, give two 'Water' packets.
It's too hot.

81
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,666
Netaji Nagar public is asking,
“what would Mr. Nagendra moving in.

82
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:11,370
AC cars know about the
problems of common man?

83
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,530
Hello, what is this coming
to our area? Which channel?

84
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,330
Who are you?

85
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,755
Our brother What in our brother's
area? Hey, break the camera.

86
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:18,673
Hey, catch them, catch.

87
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,736
When we are trying to bring out
the inner feeling of public

88
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,129
from third eye channel, Nagendra's
followers are attacking on us.

89
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,965
We shall meet again if alive.
Over to studio.

90
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,390
Sir, sir.

91
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,390
What?

92
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,486
You forgot to wear pants sir.

93
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,126
Remove yours and give. Come
on remove yours and give.

94
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,029
News reader's job isn't
with the dress below table,

95
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,166
but with news above the table.

96
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,030
Are the legs being seen
when wide angle is put?

97
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,230
Won't you check the framing?

98
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,086
Will you place the camera here?
Will you place it here?

99
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,550
No hierarchy nothing, everyone
starts giving advice.

100
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,630
Mr. Niranjan, good morning.
Good morning.

101
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:55,206
If you throw those papers here, I'll
read news, take my salary and go.

102
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,230
Sorry sir,

103
00:04:58,864 --> 00:04:59,864
Story one sir.

104
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,550
Assam polling in confusion.

105
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,486
Taapsee states her concentration is
only towards the B grade (BOOTHU) films.

106
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,670
What? What is this?

107
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:11,830
Assam polling booth in
confusion full stop.

108
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,870
Taapsee states her concentration
is only towards the films.

109
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,790
Won't you put these
full stops and commas?

110
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,326
Don't you know the
basic punctuation?

111
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,046
Not just to have a drink
once the time is up sir.

112
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,830
You should know even to
put commas in timing.

113
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,510
No idea how and why
are few people born.

114
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,710
When said all get
angry and hurt.

115
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,830
Yeah, story two sir!

116
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,030
Come on throw Mr. Niranjan,
throw something here. Take.

117
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,150
Will Bharat dashing with 14 medals
stop in Super wealth games?

118
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,350
Not this colloquial
language sir,

119
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,401
when we have such a sweet
and great Telugu language,

120
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:45,061
it's written here in
this dirty language.

121
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:47,065
See now,

122
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,805
my whole mood is spoilt and that
reflection is visible over my face.

123
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,590
Sir, sir.

124
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,006
Breaking news sir, it seems heart
attack for Finance Minister.

125
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,470
Is he dead?

126
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,990
No Sir.

127
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,830
Great, 24 hours now All 24 news
channels stand outside that hospital.

128
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,281
My bad luck sir, come on take.

129
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,538
State Finance Minister Nagendra

130
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,727
collapsed with heart attack
in the state office at Delhi.

131
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,230
Even half an hour before getting the
heart attack, he spoke with press

132
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,649
and supported the statement
of planning commission that

133
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:22,950
38 rupees per days is enough for
a common man to live in India.

134
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,990
Protests have started from his
own party office with that.

135
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,201
Doctors opine that this pressure maybe
the reason for his heart attack.

136
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,092
Definitely sir.

137
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,110
Good evening sir.

138
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,200
Good evening sister.

139
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,950
Yeah give me. Thank you.

140
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,346
Shall I put the news sir?

141
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,270
We can watch news

142
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,790
but it's tough to see
when we become the news.

143
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:05,910
No need dear. Okay sir.

144
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,568
My PA Chakravarthy
will be there outside.

145
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:13,910
Ask him to come inside.

146
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,030
Okay sir.

147
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,830
Sir.

148
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,590
What's the situation,
Chakravarthy?

149
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,484
Why do you ask slowly
about what, sir?

150
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,112
You have swept aside
the matter to

151
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:30,286
turn into a controversy with
your idea of heart attack sir.

152
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,910
Your sympathy is
grown in the public.

153
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,323
All our cadre are into prayers,

154
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:37,070

bouquets etc., for your health.

155

My mind is going blank looking
at your following sir.

156
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,584

to enter my son into politics.

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,441
“watch you dance, watch you
shake,” “Watch you make a boom,”

173
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,230
“Tonight ain't over cause I
make the rhythm Blow Blow”.

174
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,350
Why don't you come to
my mom's marriage.

175
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,318
Yo Basha

176
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,320
I'll call you back.

177
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:16,911
Let's Bounce.

178
00:09:17,354 --> 00:09:18,354
Where's Jessica, bro?

179
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:21,095
We broke up.

180
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,790
You broke up, why?

181
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:28,190
I don't feel it, man. I'm not
getting that girlfriend feel.

182
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:33,308
What type of a girl do you need for
getting that sort of a feel, brother?

183
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:37,070
I don't know what type of
a girl, but I want magic.

184
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:38,628
I want Magic in Love.

185
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,039
I don't find it with Jessica.

186
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,630
That's why we broke up.

187
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:42,830
Magic!

188
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,385
It will come.

189
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,520
Bhasha let's go.

190
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,070
The name American Born Confused
Desi hasn't just come so.

191
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,750
They'd have given
seeing a guy like you.

192
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:04,462
Good Morning sir.
Good Morning Mr Karthik.

193
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,790
You said to submit those
Chicago branch project files,

194
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,310
are they ready?

195
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,744
It's done sir,
almost 90% is over.

196
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:12,477
I believe only in two
numbers, zero and hundred.

197
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:15,688
100 if the work is done, else zero.
Yes sir.

198
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,710
Don't come up with numbers in between.
Come up with your work.

199
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,530
Okay sir.

200
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,579
Those documents should be with
me in the next two hours. Okay?

201
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:22,603
Sure sir.

202
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,332
This is the high way this
is a five star resort.

203
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,150
And the entire project
is a golf course.

204
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,643
We are looking forward
to work with you.

205
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,667
Thank you.

206
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,464
Sir, your son Avi's bills.

207
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,230
Twenty thousand
Dollars in one month?

208
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,590
Does he know the value
of money, Murthy?

209
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,750
Coming with a dream to achieve
something 25 years back,

210
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,937
with a thought not just to develop
but should give work to a few,

211
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:47,990
I came to this stage
saving every Dollar.

212
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:50,068
But he is becoming like this.

213
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,750
How to change him, Murthy?

214
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,124
Sir, we may see Dollar rate
falling to Rupee rate.

215
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:58,830
But it's impossible for
Avi sir to change.

216
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,430
Call him once and
ask where is he?

217
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,070
"American Born Confused Desi."

218
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,190
"American Born Confused Desi."

219
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,597
Mom!

220
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,931
Hey mom! Good morning. What
do you have for breakfast?

221
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,373
Mom I'm talking to you.

222
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,686
You should talk in Telugu
language only at home.

223
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,710
Huh.

224
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:44,086
How does the language matter? You
understand what I'm talking, right?

225
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,640
Whatever language
you talk outside,

226
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,678
you should talk in
Telugu at home with mom.

227
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,930
Mother, I'm hungry,
will you serve me food?

228
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,364
Yeah! That sounds good?

229
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,493
See, it's so good.

230
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,698
Why don't you too talk in
Telugu like Basha, son?

231
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,510
Basha's Telugu Damn.

232
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,510
What, Telugu of your niece?

233
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:08,625
It isn't so easy to shorten the
name Bala Shanmugam as Basha,

234
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:09,895
for him to talk in Telugu.

235
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,348
His Telugu is dead as
he couldn't listen

236
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:12,852
and bear with his
Tamil accent Telugu.

237
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,277
Drink this before
having breakfast.

238
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:17,746
What's this?

239
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,637
You drank in the night, right?

240
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,030
For the body not to dehydrate,
this will rehydrate the body.

241
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:28,510
Do one thing Mix and give a peg too
and they'd give you best mother award.

242
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,990
Stop it. When would kids
enjoy if not at this age?

243
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,670
They'll understand as they grow.

244
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:39,030
Parenting style has changed,
we should get updated.

245
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:44,371
Okay It seems you broke
up with that white girl?

246
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,990
What? Who your agent
Basha said that?

247
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,951
What if whoever tells me, son?
You broke up and that's enough.

248
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:53,879
Mom, I broke up.

249
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,859
Why so much of happiness
for you when I break up?

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,219
What if not, son?

251
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,670
I've been saying white girls won't set
for you and the same has happened.

252
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,630
Keep watching and I'd look for a good
Telugu girl and get you married.

253
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:09,914
Mom, you always say about
Telugu, India and culture.

254
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,226
Aren't there any other
topics for you than these?

255
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,864
Yes yes Next topic is about
the spending by you.

256
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,232
20,000 Dollars means approximately
1.5 Million in Indian currency,

257
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,230
that means a family of four can
happily live for five years.

258
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,430
But that is your monthly spend.

259
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,470
Do you have any idea how
are you living, Avi?

260
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,332
No dad will feel happy when
scolding the son, Avi.

261
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,150
But you should know the
value of money and life.

262
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:41,177
Not just my wealth but should
share even my character as a son.

263
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,344
You forgot this. Hey.

264
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,550
What if not dad?

265
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:49,090
As your father was a farmer, you worked
hard and grew in life from childhood.

266
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:51,390
But me My dad is a Millionaire.

267
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,110
Dad, why did you work so
hard and do all this?

268
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,910
So that I can live a comfortable and
rich life I'm leading that same, right?

269
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,070
Dad, you know why are
you getting anger?

270
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:06,636
Do you know why you are angry?

271
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,416
You are just jealous as
I'm enjoying my life

272
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,986
with your money in a way
you can't enjoy life.

273
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,270
You are just jealous.

274
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,270
Be happy for your son, dad.

275
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:18,246
Most importantly thank
you for everything.

276
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,150
Love you dad. Hey.

277
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,406
You are leaving for Melbourne
in few days, right?

278
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,465
Spend some time with us.

279
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:28,065
Even my friends are exactly saying
the same. Got to go dad, bye.

280
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:32,070
Hey bro. What's up, man?

281
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,282
Hey Avi, careful son.

282
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,830
Aunt, nothing will happen to
Avi when this Basha is there.

283
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,010
How did I tell?

284
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,190
Hey I'm saying to be
careful from you.

285
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,150
Insult, insult and an insult!
Come on let's go.

286
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,030
Hello, hello.

287
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,420
Hey, you just broke up right?
Do we need this now?

288
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,714
Even if he's calm, her looks
don't seem to let him be quiet.

289
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:11,608
His look itself is bad.

290
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,278
All the best.

291
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,507
Hey bro look He is
dancing with ikkeeyaa.

292
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,474
You bloody! How dare you
touch my girl friend.

293
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:34,830
What's your problem?

294
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,550
Thank you.

295
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,870
Hey, it's more than 25
years after I came to USA.

296
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,261
But I never stepped
into Police station

297
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,749
and this is the first
time because of you.

298
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:40,858
You should be ashamed.

299
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,095
Hey! You better come out man.

300
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:48,950
I am gonna take him down.

301
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,086
You mess with my girlfriend.
I am not gonna leave you.

302
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,614
Get out. Gayatri.

303
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:53,029
I am gonna take you down.

304
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,230
Come out man, come out man.

305
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,564
Hey Avi back.

306
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:56,389
Leave me leave me.

307
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,950
I wanna kill him. I wanna kill him.
Come on Bro Come on Bro

308
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,190
I will get you someday.
You bloody Indian.

309
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,623
Let's go let's go Man.

310
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,070
Damn!

311
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,080
Honey!

312
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,347
May all the evil sight
be gone from you!

313
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:19,270
Mom, what's this old
dated blind belief?

314
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,070
Take that and break.

315
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,909
Go.

316
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:25,710
Sir, dad asked you to
meet in the evening.

317
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:28,489
What have you newly complained now?
I've not said anything, sir.

318
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:37,350
Hey dad, you called for me?

319
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,630
Yeah Avi, I need to discuss
a small matter with you.

320
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,190
Avi, you aren't any kid.

321
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,390
We can't sit all the 24 hours
thinking about your security.

322
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,884
They may attack you
anywhere and anytime now.

323
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,550
Dad, but those guys were wrong.

324
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,271
You are anyways joining in Melbourne
University in the next one month.

325
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,990
For us not to have any tension

326
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,947
it's good for you and Basha
go on India trip for a month,

327
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:05,310
enjoy happily and leave directly
to Melbourne from there.

328
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,750
By that time everything
will settle down here.

329
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,070
Dad, India? What's
there in India, Dad?

330
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:13,710
Except population and pollution!
Bad idea dad, bad idea.

331
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,550
Shut up Avi, don't forget that
your parents are from India.

332
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,149
Remember the base for each of your
enjoyment today comes from there.

333
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,333
What's dad, bro? He is
saying to go to India.

334
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:32,710
Go to India, who will go there?

335
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:34,212
But still to be in
India for 14 days

336
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:36,116
without Buffalo wild wings,
'Burger' and 'Soda'!

337
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,809
No, can't do it
bro, can't do it.

338
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:41,190
India is a bad idea bro.

339
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,230
Bad?

340
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,411
That means. No.

341
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,710
What happened?
It has mayonnaise in it.

342
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,850
How many times did I say
that I don't like ranch?

343
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,067
Hey, I told that to the burger guy.
But he.

344
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,670
What are you going to do?

345
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,550
What, what, hey hello!

346
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,465
You gonna throw that there?

347
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:02,390
That's a three pointer
bro, you can't do it.

348
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:03,470
Bet? 50 Dollars.

349
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,510
Make it 100.

350
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:05,856
Your wish.

351
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,510
Oh my gosh! 100 Dollars.

352
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,630
Hey take it easy. Give me.

353
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,715
He can't leave money take it.

354
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,510
Bro, like every human born
has a talent within,

355
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:17,190
every country on the
map has a matter.

356
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,230
We shall grab that.

357
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,960
Not convinced bro.

358
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,610
Yes, look here British salary,

359
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,990
American house, Italian
food and Indian girls.

360
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,710
A guy said its heaven
to have all the four.

361
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,630
Who said it? He is Rutherford.

362
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,470
Who is he?

363
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,695
Do we need who he is, now?

364
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,475
Matter is good and just
take it, that's all.

365
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:35,430
What should I say now?

366
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,456
Yes, look there wherever we see,
there are just two colours,

367
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:39,410
over white and dull black.

368
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,870
But India isn't so. Variety of
colours, variety of girls etc.,

369
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,510
Look here, why
don't you believe?

370
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,449
Wow.

371
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:52,296
Look here, see how cute is she -
Hey, she's film actor Kajal right?

372
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:55,592
Yes She too stays in India, right?
That's it, right?

373
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,430
Do we get such cute girls?

374
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,372
You'll get a girl cuter than her.
Trust me.

375
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:02,999
What, won't you believe? It's a
promise on me, no promise on you.

376
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,059
Hey. Shut up.

377
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:04,950
Huh Damn, is it sure?

378
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,710
Sure.

379
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:07,772
Okay, let's go to India. Yes!

380
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,180
When you said, I'd see going
ahead I didn't understand sir.

381
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:14,804
Hats off for your
fore sight sir,

382
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,600
you're bringing in Bhargav
sir at the correct time.

383
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,280
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

384
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,000
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

385
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

386
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,560
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

387
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,520
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

388
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,440
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

389
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,320
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

390
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,360
Long live, Bhargav Babu!

391
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:37,307
How do you support your
statement that 38 rupees

392
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,912
a day is enough for a
common man to live?

393
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,982
Dad said if decided one can adjust
and live in 38 rupees approximately,

394
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,160
but never insulted him.

395
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,975
It is not good for
you to use what

396
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,500
he used as an example in
flow, to gain your TRPs.

397
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,140
The public knows what he is and
what he did to them from 30 years.

398
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,061
Your opposition says what'd
you know about politics here

399
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,700
when you're into
business at Dubai.

400
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,380
They are correct, I
don't know politics.

401
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,780
I came to just serve the
people who gave us so much.

402
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,940
Thank you. Sir, sir.

403
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,840
Sir, sir.

404
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,429
Greetings sir.

405
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,143
Nagendra!

406
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:28,007
You're seen more on TV and papers
these days than in physical,

407
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,067
what's the matter?

408
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,700
Hello sir.

409
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,500
Not just your planning
commission issue

410
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,217
but issue of that Chemical
Factory at your Netaji Nagar

411
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:52,071
is slowly and
silently spreading.

412
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,540
What shall we do?

413
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,618
We gave 300 Millions as party
fund for last elections

414
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,203
and they're asking for
500 Millions this time.

415
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:03,668
We can pay party fund when you let
us run such factories, right sir?

416
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,380
I saw as a kid long
back, no change at all.

417
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,140
He's taking care of the
power project in Dubai.

418
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:14,620
I'm also growing old and wish
to bring him in politics.

419
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,026
Are the troubles we faced
till date not enough?

420
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,446
Should even our
children face them?

421
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,941
Politics is there
right in our blood.

422
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,211
I came prepared for everything sir.
Keep watching,

423
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:26,580
I'll win this election
with a record majority.

424
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Oh! Is it.

425
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,220
We just gave the ticket and you
talk records and majorities.

426
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,100
Your son doesn't look
to stop with MLA post.

427
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,700
Yes sir, you said the
word of my mouth.

428
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,725
If you can somehow get
the Finance Ministry

429
00:22:44,118 --> 00:22:46,900
I handled for so long to my son.

430
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Finance?

431
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,220
Giving a Ministry isn't as
easy as to give MLA ticket.

432
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,100
There are already so many pressures
behind me, they are torturing me.

433
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,340
Sir, you're like my father and you
should somehow look into this.

434
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:08,740
Okay, ask your son to first get into
that public and get some popularity.

435
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,780
Okay sir.

436
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,661
Though he has no experience,
we can say about popularity

437
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,580
and put his name at
least in the list.

438
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Okay sir.

439
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,853
Okay, ask him to be on that job first.
See you.

440
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
See you.

441
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,060
Look Bhargava, come here once.

442
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:38,540
To get popularity doesn't mean to get
hailed having few pimps around you.

443
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:42,161
Public doesn't believe if
you go so in neat dress

444
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,089
and costly watches and
say to do this and that.

445
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,806
You should move in them,

446
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,602
with them and make them believe
that you are their man,

447
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,662
understood?

448
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:03,693
Such a long and tiring journey bro.
Yeah, yeah, very tired.

449
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:08,180
Yes, it's like we got
an energy right?

450
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,730
Yeah, I can feel positive
vibes on our trip.

451
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,793
Yes, Incredible India.

452
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:19,402
Hello, sir.

453
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:23,460
Give him to luggage.

454
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:25,660
Sorry sir, I'm late.

455
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:28,420
Oh, he came for them.

456
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:33,386
This is India, right they don't
know who we are manage like that.

457
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,832
Are you Avi and Basha?

458
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,420
Yeah. Then please come.

459
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:40,987
Hello.

460
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,516
I'll get.

461
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,860
What's this? Dollar!

462
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,953
One Dollar of ours
is 70 rupees here.

463
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,980
That means we can enjoy
70 times more than there.

464
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Yes.

465
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,700
What bro why did you bring
a cheap car like Audi?

466
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:03,229
Hello brother, that isn't
ours but this is ours.

467
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,617
Oh no! What the hell?

468
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,180
Is this our car?

469
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:11,440
Dude, this Murthy man! Bloody,
I'm gonna call him right now.

470
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,895
Bro, bro. Leave it.
Already we are tired.

471
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,941
Just to the hotel and
we'll adjust, come on.

472
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:19,662
Hey, does the car have an engine or
are you pushing it with your feet?

473
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,216
Wow, nice roads bro. Surprising.

474
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,237
I thought India was bad.
It developed a lot bro.

475
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
Oh God!

476
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:32,942
Idiot.

477
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:37,839
Nice apartment, man.

478
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:40,139
It looks nice, but we aren't
staying here. Come let's go.

479
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:41,829
Then, why did you
stop the car here?

480
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,860
Cars won't come to the place we go to.
Just will go by walk, Let's go.

481
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,580
What?

482
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,525
Chemical factor
should be removed.

483
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,402
Our health is our right.

484
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,031
Government should come down.

485
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,722
Chemical factor
should be removed.

486
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:02,199
He's coming drunk every day.

487
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:04,269
He said no money for vegetables.

488
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,338
But he drink every
day in the Morning.

489
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:08,260
What should I say?

490
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Watch out, people.

491
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,060
How long should go.

492
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,960
Oh no! Damn, what's this?

493
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,555
If you close your nose
so for some more time,

494
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:21,501
not the foul smell but
your life will be gone.

495
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,098
Dung here and cooking beside
that are common here.

496
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,347
All that had to be in the
zoo is moving on the road.

497
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:36,463
You got to stay up over there.

498
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:39,808
What?

499
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:42,220
What the.

500
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,260
How can dad be so bloody irresponsible.
Let me just call dad bro.

501
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,820
Do it. Do it. Do it immediately.

502
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:50,250
Oh my Gosh. Dad, pick up.

503
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,180
Damn man.

504
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,860
What is this?

505
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,014
Dude, I'm going to call
that bloody Murthy.

506
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:58,220
Yeah. Yeah. Call him.

507
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
Yes sir.

508
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,480
Sir. What the bloody hell
Murthy, what is this place?

509
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,276
How can you put us at
the bloody dirty slum?

510
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,580
I'm going to get you
fired right now Murthy.

511
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,827
Sir, sir. Maybe something
went wrong doing it online.

512
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:10,780
What is this online rubbish?

513
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,525
I'll find out sir. Yes sir.
Okay sir.

514
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,836
Disgusting. Disgusting.
We aren't staying here.

515
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,827
It's your wish whether
you stay or leave,

516
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:22,287
here are the keys
and you take care.

517
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:23,460
What is this man?

518
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
Irresponsible fellow.

519
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,922
Bro. Pack up.

520
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,300
Hey Siri, which is the best
hotel in Hyderabad city?

521
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,340
Hi sir.

522
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,820
Hi, what's your good name?

523
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,100
Ratnamala sir.

524
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,660
Beautiful name and
beautiful smile too.

525
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,489
Thank you sir.

526
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,192
Hey, don't call me sir.
Treat me like your friend.

527
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,380
Okay sir.

528
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,622
Where do you stay Ratnamala?
Lakdikapool sir.

529
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,540
Ladkika? Not Ladki sir.

530
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,220
Not Ladkikapool but Lakdikapool.

531
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,620
That is not so beautiful.

532
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,620
Ratna, manager is calling you.
Go. Go.

533
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,460
Hey. Why? Why?

534
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:16,860
Excuse me, please say.

535
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
We need a room.

536
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,533
If you come directly like
this and ask for a room,

537
00:28:20,593 --> 00:28:21,916
this isn't a normal hotel for
rooms to be available sir.

538
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,515
You need to book in advance. Poor
guys, hope you don't know that.

539
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,420
Hello, do you know whom
are you talking to?

540
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:27,745
Do you know where are we from?

541
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:29,676
Any problem sir?

542
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,265
We came from America on a trip.
We need a suite room.

543
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,018
When asked whether available, he
is speaking so without respect.

544
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:35,442
Kamalakar, is the
suite room booked?

545
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,237
I mean, I thought they may
need a normal room sir.

546
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:38,620
That means, you imagined?

547
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,340
Sorry for the inconvenience
sir, we have suite room.

548
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,676
How many days are you
going to stay sir?

549
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,214
Yes. We will stay
here for one month.

550
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,381
And that too if your
treatment is good.

551
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:46,716
Our hotel is the best
in hospitality sir.

552
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,020
You'll not have any problem sir.

553
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,660
Can I have your
passports for KYC sir?

554
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,940
You go sir, I'll
send these with boy.

555
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,220
Thank you. You welcome sir.

556
00:28:58,189 --> 00:28:59,189
Sir.

557
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:05,855
Oh no. Why is dad's phone
not reachable man?

558
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:08,956
Let me put voice
message in WhatsApp.

559
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Dad, fire the Manager
immediately.

560
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,380
You know how bad was
the room he put us in?

561
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,460
But don't worry, we checked
into a very good hotel.

562
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,940
Yes, we're trying for your
phone from yesterday.

563
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,490
When you hear this message,
call back dad. Love you.

564
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,500
Basha. Avi.

565
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,919
You said girls and varieties.
Where dude?

566
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,940
Yes. That is.

567
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,166
Just a minute.

568
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
Hello, Kamala.

569
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,707
Come here. Come on man, come on.

570
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,700
Use him do not disturb me.

571
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,740
Is everything comfortable sir?

572
00:29:43,987 --> 00:29:46,179
Why the pool is so dry?

573
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:48,454
Why do you say dry when
there's so much of water sir?

574
00:29:48,543 --> 00:29:49,670
Where are the girls, man?

575
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:52,349
Sir, girls in our country
haven't yet developed so much

576
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:54,001
to get into swimming pool
wearing two piece bikini sir.

577
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,271
Say, they didn't at your hotel.

578
00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:59,260
Leave about that but
any girls you know of.

579
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Sir.

580
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:01,841
Sir, we don't have such a
facility in our hotel sir.

581
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:03,334
I'm in no way a guy as such.

582
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:06,640
Hey, I asked about where do the girls
you know in general move around.

583
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,969
Oh, that! In general
they'd be in the mall sir.

584
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:10,029
Mall.

585
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:11,733
They'd be good, right?
Yes, good sir.

586
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,319
Hello sir.

587
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,296
Please sir. Thank you.

588
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:20,500
Hey, hey what are you doing man?

589
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,238
Checking whether you have something
which you shouldn't have.

590
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:25,082
That's all or are you searching
for something you want?

591
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Hey. Go.

592
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:40,169
You said Indian girls and in colours.
Where are the girls, bro?

593
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:41,513
We're roaming all
around the mall.

594
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,780
Not even one girl came to us.
Not even one girl.

595
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,983
These all are girls right?

596
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,460
Sorry.

597
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:31,092
Hello, I'm your Vanthena.

598
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:35,660
You've seen right?
Udara Gandhadi lehyam.

599
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,740
Time waste fellow.

600
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,140
What is this?

601
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,516
Hey. There.

602
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:47,340
Super dude. Wow.

603
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,889
This isn't US but India.

604
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,460
You can't deal these
like you've dealt there.

605
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:55,780
You need a separate sketch for these.
Let me Google it.

606
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,631
How to impress Indian Girl?

607
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,500
Yes. Look, number one.
Praise their beauty.

608
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,340
That means praise
about their beauty.

609
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,200
Two. Make eye contact, which
is staring into their eyes.

610
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,555
Three. Sense of humour.

611
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:10,600
Should always keep smiling
and crack jokes, right?

612
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,140
What, have you already Googled?

613
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,260
Hey, girls are girls anywhere.

614
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,820
Avi knows such matters
better than Google.

615
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,359
See and learn.

616
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:22,340
You are doing too much.

617
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
Hi.

618
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:31,528
Yes, I just saw the dance
you did down stairs.

619
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:32,380
You are so good at it.

620
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,048
I loved it. Thank you.

621
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:38,751
Ask me now to lose weight.

622
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:41,946
How do I lose weight?

623
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Yes. I mean this product. Weight loss.
Some information.

624
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:50,037
Yeah sir.

625
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,795
This is the free sample and
this is how you can use it.

626
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,523
Okay, now if I have to ask
any doubt about product,

627
00:32:58,848 --> 00:32:59,666
can I get your number?

628
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,135
Yeah sure, It's

629
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,560
040.

630
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,720
Yeah 040.

631
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,080
42. Yeah 42.

632
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,200
42. 42.

633
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,320
02. 02.

634
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
42. 42.

635
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:14,409
(Press 1 if you are
a new customer,

636
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:17,180
(press 2 if you're already
using our paste)

637
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,596
Hello! What is this
press1, press 2 and all?

638
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,212
Sir, that's a toll free number.

639
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:25,872
You can call to that number for any
doubts you have about product.

640
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:27,483
I asked you for your
personal number.

641
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
For what?

642
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:31,784
Just like that,
let's keep in touch.

643
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,556
Maybe you have the
habit of asking

644
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,940
an unknown girl casually
for personal number,

645
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,220
but I don't have the habit of giving
personal number to a stranger sir.

646
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,527
Hey, what's wrong? I'm just
asking for your number.

647
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,500
Sir, when I said
it's no, it's a no.

648
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,601
Please leave.

649
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,380
Okay.

650
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,681
But you know what, life is very
short and the world is very small.

651
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:59,220
Who knows you may be in a need
then to ask for my number.

652
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,210
In life any thing can happen?
We don't know.

653
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,620
Idiot.

654
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,460
I said, right bro? Desi girls
won't be flattered so easily.

655
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,500
Don't say to anyone in America,
my prestige will be gone.

656
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:22,020
What's that girl rejecting me, bro?
I'm rejecting that girl.

657
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,766
Do it.

658
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,880
That will be fine. Destiny.

659
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:26,194
Bro, trust me.

660
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:29,096
Messing with these Chennai and
Hyderabad girls, it won't work out.

661
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,212
For us to enjoy
party crazily, Goa.

662
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,180
Your birthday in Goa.

663
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:43,277
Welcome sir. Hi.

664
00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:45,413
My name is Aravind and that's my man.
Basha.

665
00:34:45,473 --> 00:34:46,540
Please be seated.

666
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,356
Yes, please tell me sir.
What can I do for you?

667
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,700
We are wishing to visit Goa.

668
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,300
Oh, it's a beautiful place sir.

669
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,740
We shall see and say that sir.

670
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,820
Oh sorry, which car
do you need sir?

671
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:58,220
Car. Ferrari.

672
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:01,200
No brother, Porsche will be better.
No, Ferrari is faster.

673
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,636
This is India bro, all
these are not possible.

674
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
If Porsche. Ferrari.

675
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:06,114
Sir, please don't fight. We
don't have both of those cars.

676
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,440
No, then what do you have?

677
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,620
We have got Range Rover sir.

678
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:13,775
What? Damn. Oh my Gosh.
Range Rover.

679
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:16,756
Bro, Range Rover is a big car.
More girls will go flat.

680
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:18,173
Yes.

681
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:19,820
Will go for a Range Rover.

682
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:22,460
Sir. Hey, thanks.

683
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,340
You'll have to pay
some amount sir.

684
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,900
Any problem if I
pay full amount?

685
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
No sir.

686
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,220
Sir, this card isn't working.

687
00:35:31,284 --> 00:35:31,952
Check this.

688
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:32,935
My Indian card.

689
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:33,995
Try this.

690
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:37,540
This isn't working.

691
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:40,978
My city bank, unlimited money.

692
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,396
I think there's some
problem in the bank.

693
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,340
You keep the car ready.
We will come in one hour.

694
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,740
Sir, keys!

695
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,660
Our company rules sir.

696
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,909
Even the bank App isn't working bro.
Damn!

697
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:02,820
Excuse me driver. Tell.

698
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,656
Will there be no seat belt
as such for this vehicle?

699
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,320
Seat belt? What a question, bro.

700
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:08,745
If pregnant ladies
get into your auto,

701
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:10,291
I think they don't need
to go to the hospital.

702
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:12,155
Delivery might be done
in the vibration itself.

703
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,659
Madam, it seems
there's some problem

704
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,559
in their NRI account and
they came to meet you.

705
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,980
Welcome sir.

706
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
Please go.

707
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,260
Hello sir, I'm the Manager.

708
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,180
Hi, I'm Aravind. This is Anjali.

709
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,180
Please say how can I help you?

710
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:29,839
We have come from America.

711
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,699
And we are on a holiday
my card isn't working.

712
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,260
Okay, card please.

713
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:35,057
I will just give it to you.

714
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:37,460
Yeah. Thank you.

715
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,636
Maybe some small technical problem.
I will resolve it.

716
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Sure.

717
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,975
Bank has recently started
a new investment plan.

718
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,035
Do you have any interest?

719
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,780
Why not?

720
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Thank you.

721
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,420
Venkat, cool drinks.

722
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,580
Bro. She's very beautiful bro.
I am engaged.

723
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,235
Oh, I'm sorry.

724
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,900
Who is Vidya Prasad?

725
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,580
That's my dad. It's
my dad's account.

726
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,006
Okay. All the money in your
account was withdrawn at once.

727
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:10,657
Sorry.

728
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,980
The balance in the
account is zero.

729
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,020
What?

730
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,472
No, no some error will be
there I'll check in the net.

731
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
No.

732
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
No.

733
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:24,392
Just a minute.

734
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:28,860
You can avail our
services at any time.

735
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:31,160
Thanks for visiting us.
Thank you.

736
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,780
Hey, who is the Manager here?

737
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:58,220
Bro, I feel uncle is into debts.

738
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,380
Debts for dad. No way.

739
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:03,260
Okay.
It's dad. Hey. Hey. One minute.

740
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,819
Dad, why is no amount
there in the account?

741
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,413
I withdrew thinking there's no need
of so much amount in that now.

742
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:10,460
Stop kidding dad. Transfer
the money immediately.

743
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,860
I will send you my son.
I'll send 5000.

744
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:13,961
5000 Dollars?

745
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:15,836
That will be enough just for
our hotel bills, come on

746
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,904
I haven't said to send 5000 Dollars.
5000 Indian rupees.

747
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,699
Dad, stop kidding me.

748
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:25,499
Do you understand
what you are talking?

749
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,679
I'm very clear Avi, you
have to understand.

750
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,606
Hyderabad isn't America. Cost
of living is cheap there.

751
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,244
You don't need to anyway
pay the house rent

752
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:38,140
and thus will send 5000 rupees for
the month for you both to eat.

753
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,853
Per month. Oh, I get it.

754
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:43,820
I understood your
entire sadistic plan.

755
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,500
Well played dad, well played.

756
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,299
You think I can't come back to
America, if you don't send money?

757
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,470
I'll be back in America in 2 days.
In 2 days, keep watching.

758
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,899
What happened bro,
its debts right?

759
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,149
Hey, don't you understand?
This India trip is all a scam.

760
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:01,420
A master plan by dad, he withdrew
all the money from bank.

761
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:02,499
What?

762
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:05,540
You, saying girls and varieties.

763
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,380
Oh my, Gosh.

764
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:11,038
We're screwed bro,
we're screwed.

765
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:16,619
Sir, Falooda Philadelphia.

766
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:29,333
Hi sweet heart, hmm. You know what, I'm
in deep trouble. I need some money.

767
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:30,100
Would you just lend
me some money?

768
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:32,219
No Avi, I can't lend
you money right now.

769
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:33,339
Damn.

770
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,960
Don't you ever dare
to call me again.

771
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:38,459
Can't you just lend
me 5000 Dollars?

772
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,659
Sorry Avi, I can't.

773
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,880
Freaking take her.

774
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:45,980
Hello son, Avi. Mom.

775
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,180
How are you dear?

776
00:39:48,043 --> 00:39:49,043
Hello.

777
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:53,058
I'm not doing all this
with anger on him Gayatri.

778
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,060
For him to be change we have to
make him suffer for few days.

779
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,980
If you help him now, he'll
repent for lifelong.

780
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:01,419
Think of it.

781
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,439
Murthy. Please tell me sir.

782
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:07,756
I'm giving you a bumper offer
which you can't reject.

783
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,020
That is of sending money for
your America tickets, right sir?

784
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,798
Sir, not just me

785
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:14,378
but your dad has managed whoever
you call not to give you money.

786
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,323
Dad.

787
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:21,840
Dude, maybe your mom would help us.
Call her.

788
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,100
Yes. Mom.

789
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,525
Hey George. This is your.
Yes who is this?

790
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,379
Your wife's son speaking.

791
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,059
Could you give the
phone to my mom?

792
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,619
No, she isn't here.

793
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,740
Why isn't she there?

794
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:40,820
She divorced me.

795
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,580
She divorced you?
Hey, when dude?

796
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:44,459
Just 3 days back

797
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,922
3 days before. You joined as her
husband just a week back, right?

798
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,340
Okay, you don't cry man.

799
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:56,039
Okay, do you have my
new daddy's number?

800
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,206
You Idiot. How dare
you ask me that.

801
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Okay.

802
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,828
Oh. Oh my Gomathi!

803
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:11,260
I'll be down. You throw
bags from there.

804
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,100
May I help you?

805
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,440
Oh no.

806
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:20,691
Yeah.

807
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:25,940
It's too much of dust and moist here.
Hi. Kamala.

808
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,940
No, no. Thank you.

809
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:31,419
What are you doing sir?

810
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,616
We are practicing catches.

811
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,260
If I hadn't come, you may have
practiced running also, right sir?

812
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:40,700
Running in the night?
You're too crazy Kamala.

813
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,523
Not Kamala call me Kamalakar.

814
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,635
Manager Kamalakar.

815
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,460
Bill is 2 Lakhs, pay the money.

816
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:52,594
2 Lakh Rupees?

817
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:55,876
We don't have so much money now. If 2
days time is given, we'll get and pay.

818
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,740
Bhaskar. Sir.

819
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,288
Call the Police. Okay.

820
00:41:58,497 --> 00:42:01,209
Hey come on, one minute. Why
to the Police now manager sir?

821
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,603
Just a minute.

822
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:09,260
These are our high end gadgets.
Take these for money.

823
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:13,389
You think this is any mortgage shop to
lend 10 and 25 rupees or a star hotel?

824
00:42:14,974 --> 00:42:16,019
What shall we do now?

825
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,940
Your American passports
are there, right?

826
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,896
Put them here, pay money
and take those back.

827
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:23,480
Passport? Dude no way.

828
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,667
Bhaskar. Sir.

829
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,660
Passports.

830
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,379
Bhaskar dial it.
Hey no, one minute. Cut it.

831
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,532
What's he asking the passports dude?
Should we give?

832
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,939
Come on Search.

833
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,979
Oh no it's been an hour already.

834
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,859
That day I threw
it unnecessarily.

835
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,039
Bro, why not throw on the roads?

836
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,379
Indians pass urine at
places like these.

837
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,318
I heard that. Damn. You.

838
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,378
Idiot.

839
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:03,798
Are you searching for this?

840
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,020
Whose voice is that?

841
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:07,636
Yes, that one. Yes, that one.

842
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,740
Yes, that one super.

843
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,498
My dear, dear.
Give me two rupees.

844
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:13,580
Venomous character
2 rupees give it to her.

845
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,539
Here, take 20 rupees.
Come on, give.

846
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,732

848
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,032
Here is 2 rupees, give.

849
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,527
Very good girl, come on.

850
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,042
Hey, who are you idiots?

851
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:32,540
What, who are you rascals? Did
you come to kidnap little kids?

852
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,400
Hey Yadav.
Hey! Hey, no, no wait.

853
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,876
It's us coming newly
into that portion.

854
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,640
Oh no, is it you coming
into that house?

855
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,819
Why don't you say that?

856
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,980
Anyone coming into that house
will become close friends to me.

857
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,862
That's me.

858
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:44,300
By the way, who are you?

859
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,699
Mallesh. Chichora
Mallesh, your neighbours.

860
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,723
Oh, wow. He is Bash and I am Avi.
Okay, Come, come.

861
00:43:52,707 --> 00:43:54,052
If anyone troubles you in this

If anyone troubles you in this
area say Chichora Mallesh's name.

863
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,140
Everyone fears to me.

864
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,339
You know I hit 20 guys in
the recent celebrations.

865

Avi, Avi key.
They're still in the hospital.

This room is like this

873
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,260
Bro, toilet isn't western bro
and there is no shower also.

00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:53,380
What are you saying bro? Look,

theatre with private streaming.

Wow dad, wow beautiful place.

881
00:45:12,854 --> 00:45:14,654
I didn't expect you to
keep me in such luxury.

882
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:18,489
Hey dude, looks like
you are very happy?

883
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:21,200
Did you like the house set
by your dad, so much?

884
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,580
Hey, green tea?

drink, rich people's favourite drink.

Lick the pickle.

First time, right. A bit more.

900
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:13,588
Drink it.

901
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,527
Hey, what's this bro?

Mallesh. Chichora Mallesh.

908
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,220
“America. My America,
I'm missing you a lot”

909
00:47:06,387 --> 00:47:10,280
“Not knowing my future
in slum and this dust”

910
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,060
“When the bad time
hit me with a bat”

911
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:18,100
“My destiny flew and
jumped into dustbin”

912
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,940
“America. My America,
I'm missing you a lot”

913
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,820

“Cyclone so coming on a bicycle” “It's
like swept away all my happiness”

919
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,778
“Oh no, oh God, no”

920
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,299
“How was I and how am I now?”

921
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:02,835
Hey, what are you doing here?
Sir, sir just a minute.

922
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:03,859
Go, go.

923
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,100

“America. My America,
I'm missing you a lot”

931
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:45,500
“Not knowing my future
in slum and this dust”.

932
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:50,962
There are no signals at all.
Bro.

933
00:48:50,986 --> 00:48:52,460
Hey wifi is here, Bro.

934
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:53,997

00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,940

Hey what are you talking you Idiot?

00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,853
Bro why are you getting
angry we will pay for it.

941
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,214
Will you pay for my wife?

942
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,621
Not your wife? I want wifi.
I'll kill you.

943
00:49:17,526 --> 00:49:21,380
“Fate collapsed at once like
the flight with broken wings”

“How was I and how am I now?”

953
00:50:19,898 --> 00:50:20,991
Super.

954
00:50:28,072 --> 00:50:29,072
Sir.

955
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,700
Sit. Thank you, sir.

956
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,180
What ACP sir, you said something
confidential to be discussed?

957
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,340
No problem, say it.

958
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,009
Better if you can think
of some solution

959
00:50:50,426 --> 00:50:52,640
about that Chemical
Factory issue sir.

960
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,582
They are into rally's
and hunger protests,

961
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,662
awareness in public
is growing sir.

962
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,756
Intelligence report says
this will be coming

963
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,720
onto your neck during
the elections time, sir.

964
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:05,070
When they have a life threat
from Chemical Factory,

965
00:51:05,488 --> 00:51:08,180
they fast for us instead
of hunger strikes?

966
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:13,259
You name it again as Intelligence,
say something new ACP.

967
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,659
People are very good ACP.

968
00:51:22,636 --> 00:51:24,681
If they don't get water, if
their health isn't well,

969
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,343
have no job, when in troubles,

970
00:51:27,802 --> 00:51:29,638
they go to the temple
and say that to God

971
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:31,198
but would never
come to MLA or MP.

972
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:33,954
More than what we
did in five years,

973
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:37,580
they think about how much we gave for
every election once in five years.

974
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:41,408
We shouldn't seriously think
about their problems,

975
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:43,420
which they never take seriously.

976
00:51:46,675 --> 00:51:49,780
Now my target is
money for elections.

977
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:52,976
I don't care about their
protests and other issues.

978
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,260
What else, ACP?

979
00:51:57,974 --> 00:52:00,552
I came to say the same
sir, see you now sir.

980
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:07,084
ACP

981
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:11,228
ask your intelligence
if possible about

982
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,780
how much to give per vote to
win and my job gets easy.

983
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:29,320
Dude he stop.

984
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,780
Did he stop? Thank you.

985
00:52:35,939 --> 00:52:38,219
Hey, stop man stop.

986
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,848
Hey, are you gone
blind with money?

987
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:45,221
This dialogue didn't
set at all for us, bro.

988
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:51,186
Avi are you okay?

989
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,248
Are you okay bro?

990
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,220
Bro, tell me what Happened?

991
00:52:56,894 --> 00:53:00,500
Oh no, poor guy's
leg got fractured.

992
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:01,879
Oh no, no idea how'd he live now.

993
00:53:01,939 --> 00:53:05,099
You? You dash so with a grudge
for asking your number that day?

994
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,820
Nothing so, I didn't see.

995
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,664
What didn't you see? Oh no,
so much bleeding in inside.

996
00:53:09,724 --> 00:53:12,062
I doubt whether he'd be alive
till Ambulance is here or not.

997
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:13,660
No Ambulance, call the cops.

998
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:16,199
Yes cops, yes.
Please sir, please.

999
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,761
Please, why Police and all now?
It'll be a problem.

1000
00:53:17,785 --> 00:53:20,850
It should be a case, you call
Police, Police.

1001
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:21,975
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1002
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,722
Please sir, please! We
shall settle if required.

1003
00:53:24,964 --> 00:53:26,649
Settle, what settle?

1004
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:29,153
That is you know, some amount.

1005
00:53:30,904 --> 00:53:33,784
Are you trying to give me a bribe? Is
it a bribe for everything in India?

1006
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,317
Why should you think so?

1007
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:37,346
Why not think it as
money for treatment?

1008
00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:40,019
You give me money? Huh,
you give me money?

1009
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,100
Hey.

1010
00:53:41,921 --> 00:53:42,921
How much will you give?

1011
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,180
Rs. 3000.

1012
00:53:44,241 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh no! Brain hemorrhage bro.
Oh my God, brain hemorrhage! Oh no!

1013
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,060
Okay, okay!

1014
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,740
4000, I'll give 4000 okay?

1015
00:53:51,779 --> 00:53:54,179
4000? No, no Internal bleeding.

1016
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,106
American body madam.

1017
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,300
Please sir, I have only 5000 with me.
I don't have more than that.

1018
00:53:58,499 --> 00:53:59,499
How?

1019
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,539
You say Okay?

1020
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,973
Look, you can't buy
our pain with money.

1021
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:06,126
As we are decent boys
and to close the issue,

1022
00:54:06,186 --> 00:54:07,079
we are taking money.

1023
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:09,080
Give it.
Okay, thank you. One second.

1024
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,140
Go, go, go.

1025
00:54:10,942 --> 00:54:12,100
What's up bro?

1026
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:12,899
What?

1027
00:54:13,198 --> 00:54:14,673
You said I can't
manage Desi girls?

1028
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,579
You saw that, 80 Dollars bro.
80 Dollars bro!

1029
00:54:17,896 --> 00:54:20,072
We gave a bribe before and
we are taking bribe now.

1030
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,419
“We are changing bro”.

1031
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,218
Yes, we had somewhere around in
last week. Don't say no, now.

1032
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,779
We got 5000 rupees right?
Will drink 'Beer' bro.

1033
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,560
Hey damn! Don't be greedy,
let's have brandy.

1034
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,116
Hey, no, no that's too costly.

1035
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,901
Hey, why do you leave?
Hey, hello you! Stop I say. Stop.

1036
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,220
Damn!

1037
00:54:53,366 --> 00:54:54,366
Dad.

1038
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,425
Hello Dad.

1039
00:54:55,499 --> 00:54:57,479
Avi, I need to tell
you one thing.

1040
00:54:57,519 --> 00:54:58,978
Dad, listen first to what I say.

1041
00:54:59,234 --> 00:55:01,264
I don't have a balance if I
want to call and talk to you.

1042
00:55:01,288 --> 00:55:04,799
I understood the value of money. I
also understood the life value.

1043
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,539
I'll listen to whatever
you say from now.

1044
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:07,563
I will do my MBA dad

1045
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:09,176
I too thought the same, son.

1046
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:12,999
That's why I have even taken MBA
admissions to you and Basha.

1047
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:15,441
Huh Thanks.

1048
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:19,879
MBA Is it London school of economics
or Melbourne University as we thought?

1049
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,759
LSE is really hard to get into.
But if we try, we can.

1050
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,839
Hey Avi, as you think, I didn't take
admission at London or Melbourne

1051
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:26,758
but in India.

1052
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:28,565
What India?

1053
00:55:29,556 --> 00:55:33,119
Hey Avi, there isn't a better
place than India for studying.

1054
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:35,783
See, for you to return
back to US again,

1055
00:55:36,283 --> 00:55:37,599
you've to finish MBA and come.

1056
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,623
I took admission for you in Nava
Bharat group of Institution

1057
00:55:40,855 --> 00:55:41,933
and made all the arrangements.

1058
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:42,959
Remember one more thing,

1059
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:45,385
I'll send the monthly amount
of 5000 rupees as said,

1060
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,239
only if the attendance is good.

1061
00:55:47,508 --> 00:55:49,992
Dad, you don't feel great like
Chiranjeevi from Swayamkrishi film.

1062
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:51,644
Don't think I'll change
if pushed into troubles.

1063
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:54,479
I'm born rich, grew rich
and will live as rich.

1064
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:56,820
I'm not going to any
college in India. Bye.

1065
00:55:57,365 --> 00:55:58,365
Hey.

1066
00:56:00,508 --> 00:56:02,079
Gone all gone.

1067
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,662
5000 it seems and should
do MBA in India only,

1068
00:56:03,686 --> 00:56:04,686
it seem What a damn!

1069
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:05,919
Damn!

1070
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,760
Hey, why are throwing such a
costly phone over the ground?

1071
00:56:08,805 --> 00:56:09,639
Is your mind gone or what?

1072
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:10,639
Hey, shut up Get out.

1073
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:13,819
Hey dude, by sharing
drink we get a kick

1074
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:15,719
when problem is shared
you get solution.

1075
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,455
When I use my hand you get pain.

1076
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:19,052
Oh no! Don't get angry dude,

1077
00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:22,007
say your story and I'd
decide the climax

1078
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:23,727
I need three Lakhs
rupees, will you give?

1079
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:26,665
Three Lakhs, for what bro?

1080
00:56:26,785 --> 00:56:28,319
Why do you need
reasons, will you give?

1081
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:29,544
I can't give you

1082
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,418
but I can make someone else lend.

1083
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:33,964
You?

1084
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:37,319
Oh God, you are not knowing
where all are my towers are.

1085
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:39,016
During demonetisation

1086
00:56:39,136 --> 00:56:43,871
I made 40 Million that is 4 Million
black money change into white

1087
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:45,239
and that is Chichora Mallesh.

1088
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,621
I'll handover three Lakhs if
you put a lakh in my hands,

1089
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:48,741
what do you say?

1090
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:51,274
Can I believe?

1091
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:54,158
Don't believe, I just wanted to help.
Why for me, bro?

1092
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,479
Malli Malli.

1096
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,727
It took so long for selling I-pad,
laptop and all and get the money.

1097
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:08,279
Here!

1098

00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,799
Hey granny, are you fine?

1100
00:57:16,316 --> 00:57:17,559
Mallesh?

1101
00:57:18,093 --> 00:57:19,719
Why are you not seen these days?

1102
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:22,879
What these days, you are
unable to see from one year.

1103
00:57:22,915 --> 00:57:23,998
That's why they gave
you spectacles.

1104
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:26,039
By the way, these are
my close friends.

1105
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:28,639
They came from America
by flight for just me.

1106
00:57:30,205 --> 00:57:30,759
Hello Grandma.

1107
00:57:31,053 --> 00:57:31,639

Oh no!

1111
00:57:48,147 --> 00:57:48,919
How did you hit?

1112
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:50,439
Is it you son? Then?

1113
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,879
I felt someone else and hit.

1114
00:57:52,243 --> 00:57:53,323
It's us granny, it's us.

1115
00:57:53,654 --> 00:57:54,654

1116
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:56,698

1117
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:58,359
Yes, Super.

1118
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:00,356
She is look like some different.

1119
00:58:02,115 --> 00:58:03,199
Here are three Lakhs.

1120
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:04,450
Thank you dude,

1121
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:06,211
I can never forget
you in my whole life.

1122
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,719
What dude, getting so excited
for such a small thing.

1123
00:58:08,879 --> 00:58:12,399
You silly NRIs! Go, go and
party great with this.

1124
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:14,519
Oh, no This isn't
for partying dude.

1125
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,879
Matter is, I and Basha are
missing our parents a lot.

1126
00:58:18,342 --> 00:58:19,586
That's why, we wanted
to visit America

1127
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:20,494
and see them once.

1128
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,767
Move dude, we shall go
to airport, buy tickets.

1129
00:58:22,887 --> 00:58:24,199
Hello, back, back

1130
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:26,997
what, will you go to
America with this money?

1131
00:58:27,021 --> 00:58:28,997
Oh my Goddess Peddamma.

1132
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:31,105
Why?

1133
00:58:31,328 --> 00:58:33,039
These are fake notes. Fake!

1134
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:35,417
What? Fake notes?

1135
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:36,639
What's that?

1136
00:58:36,759 --> 00:58:39,294
Then Three Lakhs for One lakh on
the spot means we get only these.

1137
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:42,239
What? We are screwed bro.

1138
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:43,992
We are gone if Police
catches us now.

1139
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:45,959
What shall we do
with these, Malli?

1140
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:47,295
What do I know dude?

1141
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:49,919
I thought you were asking to
enjoy at pubs and parties.

1142
00:58:50,704 --> 00:58:51,719
Oh no.

1143
00:58:52,356 --> 00:58:55,719
Malli, I don't know what you do.
Return this and bring our money back.

1144
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,004
Look dude, this is
a big business.

1145
00:58:58,064 --> 00:59:00,399
Money once gone in
won't come back again.

1146
00:59:00,722 --> 00:59:01,722
What is this man?

1147
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:06,368

00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:32,363
Some guys are taking away the
money, they're taking away money.

1151
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:56,919
Hey leave me.

1152
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,360

That is Basha.

1156
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:25,417
Under ground is safe for us.

1157
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:39,279
Hey, Avi careful dude.

1158
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:41,559

Sorry. Sorry.

1163

Oh my lord Ventakatesh!
Lord Jesus!

1164
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,066
Oh God!

1165
01:01:35,017 --> 01:01:36,120
Oh shit!

1166
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,824
Bro, what's our future now bro?

1167
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:42,279
What else, be quiet, do as
Dad said and go to College.

1168
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:50,601
Which bus goes to Nava
Bharat College, Sir?

1169
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:52,142
It's in front of you.

1170
01:01:52,771 --> 01:01:53,771
I'm sorry.

1171
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,638
It's in front of you.

1172
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:57,786
I can't understand
what you say, Sir.

1173
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,339
I'm saying the same bro,

That bus? Why not say before?

1176
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:10,078
My pan would go waste bro.

1177
01:02:13,803 --> 01:02:15,367
Even this will go, get in.

1178
01:02:16,035 --> 01:02:17,537
This, where is the place?

1179
01:02:18,018 --> 01:02:19,880
You have at least place
to land your feet.

1180
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,652
You won't have even
that in the next bus.

1181
01:02:22,399 --> 01:02:23,719
Hey stop the Bus.

1182
01:02:23,779 --> 01:02:25,812

01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:47,319
Dude, we can't leave
that money man.

1189
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:49,640

girls in the front.

I won't come, ask your
dad to whatever he can.

1195
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:05,459
What? I won't stay calm at
all, what's the matter?

1196
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,405
Sir, I had bath in the morning.

1197
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
Humans dude.

1198
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,016
Please move a bit. Yes,

1199
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,040
What is your problem?

1200
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:28,319
Brother, side brother.

1201
01:03:29,141 --> 01:03:30,141

1202
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:31,476

01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:15,487
Desi girls, bro.

1216
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,639
Hey!

1217
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:19,159
What Bro?

1218

Ajay, how are you?
Hello brother.

1219
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:32,279
Hello brother.

1220
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,555
What is the matter?
Everything is fine bro,

1221
01:04:34,919 --> 01:04:37,359
We are planning many activities
before the elections, bro.

1222
01:04:37,439 --> 01:04:38,999
To say that with you.

1223
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,919
Come to the house tomorrow
for once, let's talk.

1224
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:44,103
Your records Hello Sir.

1225
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:46,162
Principal should be
strict with students

1226
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,466
and in favour to the Management.

1227
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,666
What are you in favour of students
and strict with management?

1228
01:04:50,879 --> 01:04:51,719
Why do you say so Sir?

1229
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:53,043
Elections are nearing.

1230
01:04:53,261 --> 01:04:55,807
I said to collect the pending
fees and how far has that come?

1231
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:56,979
We are collecting Sir.

1232
01:04:57,248 --> 01:04:59,239
When now? Is it after
the elections?

1233
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:02,652
I mean, we sent circulars and
are putting pressure Sir

1234
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:04,144
I don't care whether
you send circulars

1235
01:05:04,168 --> 01:05:05,919
or send them out when
fees are not paid.

1236
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:08,613
I want all the fees to be collected
by the 25th of this month.

1237
01:05:08,637 --> 01:05:09,637
Okay Sir.

1238
01:05:12,459 --> 01:05:15,959
If you don't think about this,
I'll have to think about you.

1239
01:05:16,397 --> 01:05:17,397
I understood, sir.

1240
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:32,379
What do you understand
seeing all this bro?

1241
01:05:32,403 --> 01:05:35,899
If there is a good Western toilet here,
there'd be a pleasure going out,

1242
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:38,262
upload full and then
download coming here.

1243
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,959
Aravind Prasad, Bala
Shanmugam, MBA Finance.

1244
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:48,359
Irrespective of Finance, Marketing,
Engineering or Pharmacy,

1245
01:05:48,576 --> 01:05:52,924
Semester fee of every course should
be collected by the 25th. Understood?

1246
01:05:53,343 --> 01:05:56,437
I understand bro, but what's
5000 for both per month?

1247
01:05:56,497 --> 01:05:59,793
It's just 70 Dollars, to live here even
5000 rupees each wouldn't be enough.

1248
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:04,787
Why are you surprised saying 5000?
Yes, 5000! Let's give 5000 per vote.

1249
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:07,999
Poor guys, it's their pocket
money once in 5 years

1250
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:09,777
and giving less won't look good.

1251
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:11,839
Oh, pocket money!

1252
01:06:12,237 --> 01:06:16,452
Have you ever given me a 100 saying
I'd have a need and to take it?

1253
01:06:16,812 --> 01:06:19,319
Bro, full body pains and
I got bashed up well.

1254
01:06:19,568 --> 01:06:23,079
Good that I get 500 rupees for
evening drink, I mean Medicine.

1255
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:25,979
Please dude, my dear please.

1256
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:28,039
Days to beg saying please
are gone, Chakravarthy.

1257
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:30,679
Everything now is
to cleverly Grab.

1258
01:06:30,818 --> 01:06:34,239
Don't pull dude, leave. We don't
have money at all, it'd get torn. Hey!

1259
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:35,399
Sorry bro. Idiot.

1260
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,159
You don't talk like an idiot.

1261
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:40,642
Who has guts to put a
hold to our majority

1262
01:06:40,702 --> 01:06:41,982
in our constituency opposing us?

1263
01:08:03,598 --> 01:08:05,295
University of Melbourne.

1264
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:07,679
Dude, you shut up. It's
all because of you.

1265
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:10,371
You got excited saying Indian
girls, right? Move now.

1266
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:17,898
Dear students, two new students are
going to join in our class today.

1267
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,279
Though they are born and
brought up in America,

1268
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:24,238
just with an interest
to study in India

1269
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:27,204
they are joining in our
college in NRI quota.

1270
01:08:27,959 --> 01:08:30,838
So, you have to be very supportive
and friendly with them.

1271
01:08:31,206 --> 01:08:32,206
Okay.

1272
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:34,762
Why are you waiting
outside Come in.

1273
01:08:39,851 --> 01:08:42,359
Guys, he is Aravind. Hi guys.

1274
01:08:42,507 --> 01:08:44,039
And he is Balashanmugam.

1275
01:08:45,135 --> 01:08:46,599
Guys, make yourself comfortable.

1276
01:08:46,802 --> 01:08:47,418
Sure.

1277
01:08:47,478 --> 01:08:49,439
Whatever problems you
have, say with me.

1278
01:08:50,136 --> 01:08:51,948
Yes, already you've
missed two weeks classes.

1279
01:08:52,008 --> 01:08:53,280
But you have to
catch up very fast.

1280
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:54,304
Okay.

1281
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,199
Neha.

1282
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,799
Oh no, why did I get booked so?

1283
01:09:03,959 --> 01:09:04,759
Yes Sir.

1284
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:07,069
Look free time daily and explain
to them the syllabus completed.

1285
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,213
And keep in touch with them.

1286
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:09,971
Okay Sir. Guys.

1287
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,401

Aravind.

1289
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,189
Mr. Aravind.

1290
01:09:23,402 --> 01:09:24,599
Sir said, right?

1291
01:09:25,407 --> 01:09:26,407

1292
01:09:26,549 --> 01:09:28,069

01:09:28,466 --> 01:09:29,479

01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,805
Not now, but daily one hour

1295
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,210
before the college or after
college would be enough.

1296
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:37,359
Okay.

1297
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:39,189

01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:53,519
She is asking me
for my number bro.

1302
01:09:53,879 --> 01:09:57,172
Didn't I say to you before? Life is
too short and the world is too small.

1303
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,279
I and you may face each other tomorrow
and then you may ask for my number.

1304
01:10:00,358 --> 01:10:03,599
Did you listen?
See, it's happening.

1305
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:09,231
Okay then, get the classes from
someone else. I'll talk to Sir.

1306
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:11,519
Hello. Hello, I'm not like you.

1307
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:14,409
When someone asks for the number

1308
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:15,919

1313
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:28,439
Neha.

1314
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:32,519
And by the way, you
can call me Avi.

1315
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:40,119
Hey, get up. Its eight dude.

1316
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,379
Where?

1317
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:47,383
Neha said to take the class
and asked to come, right?

1318
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:50,999
Oh! So you have to learn all
the missed classes now,

1319
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:53,584
complete MBA, achieve a gold
medal, wear a waste cap,

1320
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:57,959
worn out coat, take a photo
and go back to the US?

1321
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:01,239
Hey, Basha here!

1322
01:11:01,519 --> 01:11:03,355
I know well about
why you're going.

1323
01:11:03,482 --> 01:11:07,879
You go on that job. I'll sleep and
think about how to go back to the US.

1324
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:09,032
Do your own job.

1325
01:11:17,537 --> 01:11:18,537
Oh God!

1326
01:11:22,999 --> 01:11:23,999
Neha!

1327
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:29,959
Sorry, Neha!

1328
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:31,386
Got up early by 6 and
by the time I went to

1329
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,975
temple in the traffic and
came back, I got late.

1330
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:36,764
8'O clock means you should be
here sharp by 8 from tomorrow.

1331
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:37,639
Otherwise, I'll say to Sir.

1332
01:11:37,799 --> 01:11:39,543
Oh, will you call even
him from tomorrow?

1333
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,079
These silly jokes
aren't required.

1334
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:46,079
So, coming to today's topic,

1335
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,526
basically demand and elasticity

1336
01:11:49,586 --> 01:11:53,041
that means Consumers are more
responsive to the variable.

1337
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:13,919
In to the organisation.

1338
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,399
Explain to the organisation.

1339
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:19,128
Hello, you understand
what I'm saying?

1340
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:20,639
Yes.

1341
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:23,319
Then say, what I
explained so far.

1342
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,900
Yes. You were talking about the
socio-economic problems of India.

1343
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,847
The root cause of these problems
is the beautiful blue dress.

1344
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:30,792
No, no, that, that the
blueprint and that the.

1345
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:36,483
The two disparities
decrease peoples increase

1346
01:12:36,543 --> 01:12:38,241
earrings no, no earnings.

1347
01:12:38,301 --> 01:12:40,816
The GDP has slowed down right
now because of the black money

1348
01:12:40,944 --> 01:12:43,519
and there is there
is a stagnation.

1349
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,444
Stagnation in the economy because
of the black money reserves.

1350
01:12:45,468 --> 01:12:46,540
And it's the responsibility
of the government,

1351
01:12:46,564 --> 01:12:48,959
for the upliftment
of these lips,

1352
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:50,439
no, no upliftment of the poor.

1353
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:53,439
Listen, please pay attention.

1354
01:12:54,064 --> 01:12:57,511
Teaching you isn't any fun for me. Sir
asked and that's why I'm teaching.

1355
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:03,359
Next topic.

1356
01:13:20,089 --> 01:13:20,930
You still didn't leave?

1357
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,679
You said class after college, right?
I'm thus waiting.

1358
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:25,759
Oh God, I'm so sorry. I forgot.

1359
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:28,199
I'd been to the hostel when
Santhi called for a birthday.

1360
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:32,279
It's already late,
shall we sit tomorrow?

1361
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:33,679
Okay.

1362
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,159
Avi, how will you go?

1363
01:13:36,799 --> 01:13:37,599
By walk.

1364
01:13:37,799 --> 01:13:39,759
By walk, what's that?

1365
01:13:40,799 --> 01:13:43,199
Busses will follow timings, right?
It's gone by 4:30.

1366
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:46,719
Next bus is somewhere at 8 or 8:30,
maybe longer. I will walk it up.

1367
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,839
Where do you stay?

1368
01:13:58,439 --> 01:13:59,879
Stop, stop, right here.

1369
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:03,946
Avi. Avi.

1370
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,377
As it was just raining, I took out
the clothes as they'd get wet.

1371
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:08,934
Is it, you are taking
so much care about me.

1372
01:14:08,994 --> 01:14:10,839
Thank you It's Okay, dear.

1373
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:17,412
Yes, come.

1374
01:14:22,548 --> 01:14:24,193
This is the house I stay.

1375
01:14:26,119 --> 01:14:29,079
They said you came from the
US and you staying here?

1376
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,399
Dad.

1377
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,553
The first hero for
everyone in life,

1378
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:37,917
but the only villain I
have in my life is my dad.

1379
01:14:39,049 --> 01:14:40,169
My dad is crazy about money.

1380
01:14:41,016 --> 01:14:44,359
He used to always go out of
home saying to earn money.

1381
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:56,544
No time to feed his
son making him sit

1382
01:14:57,303 --> 01:14:59,679
beside but had no time
even to kiss his son.

1383
01:15:05,352 --> 01:15:08,879
Was he at least good to my mom?
No, he always came home drunk and

1384
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:14,679
and then.

1385
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,519
Good night.

1386
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:21,959
Amongst these conditions at home,
just education became my relief.

1387
01:15:26,799 --> 01:15:28,915
That's why, I used to spend
more time in college.

1388
01:15:32,519 --> 01:15:34,479
When Baba said to
be useful for all,

1389
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:37,627
my dad understood as not to
do any help without a profit.

1390
01:15:37,919 --> 01:15:41,879
That's why I understood the problems of
the poor and decided to be one of them.

1391
01:15:42,617 --> 01:15:44,839
I fought with blacks in America.

1392
01:15:46,387 --> 01:15:48,439
Fought for blacks in
America and went to jail.

1393
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:51,319
My dad didn't come even to get me a
bail thinking it's a waste of money.

1394
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:56,764
Seeing my dad so from childhood,
I got vexed up with the money.

1395
01:15:57,305 --> 01:16:00,439
After coming to America from India,
my dad became mad for money.

1396
01:16:00,865 --> 01:16:03,319
That's why, I decided to
move from there to here.

1397
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,580
I and my cousin
leaving that country,

1398
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:09,418
Millions of wealth, comforts
wished to stand by ourselves,

1399
01:16:09,553 --> 01:16:14,439
joined MBA and are leading happy
normal life amongst the common men.

1400
01:16:17,468 --> 01:16:18,319
Oh God!

1401
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:19,999
That's very inspiring.

1402
01:16:20,599 --> 01:16:24,694
You decided to stand on your own
without depending on parents

1403
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:26,279
and I really appreciate you.

1404
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:27,399
Thank you.

1405
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:29,596
At first, when I came from the
US wanted to make friendship

1406
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,940
with you as I knew none and
asked for your number, but you.

1407
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:36,279
I said so not knowing about you.

1408
01:16:36,799 --> 01:16:39,069
It's enough that you know
all these are simple

1409
01:16:39,234 --> 01:16:42,239
mischief in this age but
not as bad as you thought

1410
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:44,679
I'm really sorry about that.

1411
01:16:44,799 --> 01:16:46,719
No, that's okay.

1412
01:16:48,602 --> 01:16:50,999
Okay then, bye.

1413
01:16:52,759 --> 01:16:53,759
Bye.

1414
01:16:58,079 --> 01:16:59,079
Avi.

1415
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:01,733
Friends?

1416
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:03,999
Friends?

1417
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:06,199
Yes, of course.

1418
01:17:14,967 --> 01:17:16,399
Okay then, bye.

1419
01:17:16,702 --> 01:17:17,702
Bye.

1420
01:17:22,937 --> 01:17:25,119
Hey, what's this dude?

1421
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:28,399
Baba said no mistake to say even
10 lies to make a girl flat dude.

1422
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:29,639
What, Baba?

1423
01:17:32,919 --> 01:17:34,457
Detailed quantification

1424
01:17:34,787 --> 01:17:39,279
of resource requirements that
are expected for a given time.

1425
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:41,649
Remember this is a
very important topic.

1426
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:43,239
First, you note down this table.

1427
01:17:43,601 --> 01:17:49,279
In this table, you can see all the
expenses that are done by the company

1428
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:52,475
for material or people so.

1429
01:17:52,663 --> 01:17:53,384
He's calling.

1430
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:55,411
Operating expenses statement.

1431
01:17:55,607 --> 01:17:57,839
Let's see, accounts or payable.
Excuse me, Sir.

1432
01:17:57,972 --> 01:17:58,972
Yes, come in.

1433
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:01,559
Circular Sir.

1434
01:18:02,999 --> 01:18:04,265
Swathi. Sir.

1435
01:18:04,325 --> 01:18:06,439
You go urgently to the
Administrative department.

1436
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:16,601
So, resource requirements are
Capital, material or people.

1437
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:24,531
Sir.

1438
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:28,039
Why are you still standing here,
if not to take my job away?

1439
01:18:28,494 --> 01:18:30,312
They'd remove your name
from register saying

1440
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,834
that you haven't paid
your fees by the 25th.

1441
01:18:31,858 --> 01:18:34,119
You won't get the hall ticket
and you can't write exams.

1442
01:18:34,431 --> 01:18:35,431
Please go.

1443
01:18:35,599 --> 01:18:39,650
Sir, please give me one week time.
I'll definitely pay Sir.

1444
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:42,361
It was better if you had cried
so at your house in advance.

1445
01:18:42,503 --> 01:18:44,439
What can I do when
you cry coming here?

1446
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:46,239
This is Management's decision.

1447
01:18:46,879 --> 01:18:48,375
Strict orders are given

1448
01:18:48,435 --> 01:18:50,955
not to allow any students who don't
pay fees to write the exams.

1449
01:18:51,123 --> 01:18:53,256
I can't do anything if
you cry or do anything.

1450
01:18:53,316 --> 01:18:54,319
Please go.

1451
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:01,136
Yes! 5000 got credited, bro.
Yes.

1452
01:19:01,196 --> 01:19:02,522
Bro.

1453
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,880
And operation course.

1454
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,680
So it may be thought
of an action plan.

1455
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,160
A budget helps
allocate resources,

1456
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,560
evaluate performance, is an
essential part of a business plan.

1457
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,240
When starting a new business.

1458
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,200
Once a business is established.
Budgeting becomes a regular task.

1459
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:20,519
Swathi, what happened?

1460
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,560
Swathi. What happened? Normally occurs
on a quarterly and annual basis.

1461
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,960
Dude!

1462
01:19:35,728 --> 01:19:36,959
Just one peg and that's all.

1463
01:19:37,312 --> 01:19:39,472
Otherwise, it crosses our budget.
Yes correct, correct.

1464
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:46,630
One more Sir?

1465
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:56,039
One more.

1466
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:01,119
What now?

1467
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:06,039
We got the idea not to drink above our
budget, that means we are changing.

1468
01:20:06,549 --> 01:20:07,608
We are changing.

1469
01:20:07,668 --> 01:20:08,839
You are changing Sir.

1470
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:12,479
Yeah! As Obama said
change is good.

1471
01:20:12,759 --> 01:20:13,759
To change is good.

1472
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:15,559
Yes drink, come on drink.

1473
01:20:21,252 --> 01:20:22,639
Change is good, bro.

1474
01:20:23,355 --> 01:20:29,087
Correct bro, but you did not change
in regards with Neha. Suppose.

1475
01:20:29,147 --> 01:20:30,159
Silence! Yes Neha,

1476
01:20:33,127 --> 01:20:34,127
Neha.

1477
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:38,197
I and Basha are in
combine studies.

1478
01:20:41,959 --> 01:20:42,959
What?

1479
01:20:44,265 --> 01:20:45,265
Is it!

1480
01:20:45,759 --> 01:20:46,759
I'm just coming.

1481
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:49,719
What Neha again, dude?
Won't you change at all?

1482
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:51,693
Hey, Neha's best friend
Swathi is there, right?

1483
01:20:51,717 --> 01:20:52,430
She is ranker dude!

1484
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:55,090
It seems they removed her from
College as she didn't pay the fees.

1485
01:20:55,922 --> 01:20:57,079
She committed suicide.

1486
01:20:57,159 --> 01:20:59,999
I'm going. Pay the bill
and come immediately.

1487
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:03,316
We are at the hospital bro.

1488
01:21:03,496 --> 01:21:04,496
The girl is safe

1489
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,969
and we'll say something when the
press is here and come back.

1490
01:21:08,062 --> 01:21:10,559
Okay, Chakravarthy
will be coming.

1491
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,190
Say that we'll bear
her hospital expenses

1492
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:13,827
and to pay her total MBA
fees and compromise so

1493
01:21:13,851 --> 01:21:15,479
that the news doesn't come out.

1494
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,879
I'll take care of the rest.
Okay bro.

1495
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:30,759
Forget everything right here and
don't talk to anyone outside, okay?

1496
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,439
What work do you have here?
Why do you care?

1497
01:21:33,999 --> 01:21:35,677
When our College girl
is into problems,

1498
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:38,643
instead of fighting about that
have you come here to support him?

1499
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:39,801
Look Neha,

1500
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,115
great people are there to take care
of the good and bad of College.

1501
01:21:42,139 --> 01:21:43,379
You go and look into your work.

1502
01:21:43,428 --> 01:21:44,508
Who are those great people?

1503
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:48,119
Those who put a deadline to
debar if the fees aren't paid?

1504
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:52,026
Those who sent you to console
after everything is over?

1505
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:55,959
Hey, I won't stay quiet if you
say another word about bro.

1506
01:21:56,019 --> 01:21:59,039
You are habituated to the
money and drink he gives.

1507
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,719
And that's why you support him.

1508
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:02,119
Why should we support?

1509
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:04,199
It's become an issue now
and thus they came down.

1510
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,395
What about the other students
who can't pay the fees?

1511
01:22:06,419 --> 01:22:08,315
I'm saying brother will take
care of all these, right?

1512
01:22:08,339 --> 01:22:11,191
Student Union council has decided
to settle this issue right here.

1513
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:13,211
No need of any Union to
poke their nose into this.

1514
01:22:13,745 --> 01:22:17,839
All the students will do a strike
questioning the Management about this.

1515
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:19,422
Strike?

1516
01:22:19,482 --> 01:22:23,119
For what, her mom already took
the money and is compromised.

1517
01:22:26,999 --> 01:22:27,999
Aunt.

1518
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,088
When money is asked, they say
to die and cry now when given.

1519
01:22:38,799 --> 01:22:42,203
They don't know the value of money
but come forward to give speeches.

1520
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,081
Excuse me.

1521
01:22:47,808 --> 01:22:50,439
What did you say? We don't
know the value of money?

1522
01:22:50,839 --> 01:22:53,297
Hey ABCD, you are not from here.

1523
01:22:53,357 --> 01:22:55,735
It isn't good for you to unnecessarily
poke your nose into this.

1524
01:22:55,759 --> 01:22:59,339
Who cares about from where dude?
Money is money and money for all.

1525
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:01,585
What do you know about money's
value when you paid Millions.

1526
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,119
And joined in NRI quota?

1527
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:05,039
Only we know the value of money.

1528
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:06,839
We thinking always about the
toothpaste used by squeezing out from

1529
01:23:06,863 --> 01:23:07,883
the time we wake up
till the night we grab

1530
01:23:07,907 --> 01:23:09,718
and cover the blanket hich
isn't enough for sleeping.

1531
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:12,360
Only we know the value of money.

1532
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:13,854
Do you want to know how?

1533
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:16,056
For the breakfast done to
break 8 hours of fasting,

1534
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,719
after eating 4 'Idli'
for 20 rupees,

1535
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,006
though we feel stomach will fill
if two more 'Idlis' are eaten,

1536
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:22,559
we kill the hunger
and save money.

1537
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:26,039
As it costs 12 rupees if two tea is
ordered, we order one tea for 6 rupees,

1538
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:28,839
share adjusting that sharing
is caring in friendship.

1539
01:23:29,959 --> 01:23:32,615
After coming to the bus stop, even
when all the sharing autos are empty,

1540
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:35,257
we feel why to waste 15 rupees
when we have our RTC and wait.

1541
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:37,201
As it costs 3 rupees
more in Metro,

1542
01:23:37,261 --> 01:23:39,377
we wait for the shabby bus
with no place even to stand,

1543
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:41,759
Push and get pushed and
come to the College.

1544
01:23:41,992 --> 01:23:42,810
After coming to the College,

1545
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:44,575
with the money saved at
breakfast in the morning,

1546
01:23:44,599 --> 01:23:46,064
we eat a plate of meals
each in the canteen

1547
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:47,728
and have two 'Chapatis'
each in the night.

1548
01:23:48,536 --> 01:23:51,983
At times, we think 70 rupees
for All out and 100 rupees

1549
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:54,455
for power bill are to be spent extra
and sleep on the terrace in open.

1550
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:57,070
And finally 30 rupees for
toothpaste, 40 rupees

1551
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:59,495
for detergent, 60 rupees for
soap and 200 for mobile recharge.

1552
01:23:59,519 --> 01:24:03,326
If we go on saying so, 5000 per
month which means 83 rupees each.

1553
01:24:03,519 --> 01:24:05,248
If not us counting every rupee

1554
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:07,644
and live to know the value of
money, will you guys know it?

1555
01:24:07,704 --> 01:24:08,839
You bloody douchebag!

1556
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:15,952
What are you
blabbering in English.

1557
01:24:16,012 --> 01:24:18,639
If you put hand and if my shirt
tears, I lose 200 rupees.

1558
01:24:19,113 --> 01:24:21,874
And if I raise my hand and when your
bones break you lose 2000 rupees,

1559
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:23,110
is it required?

1560
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,330
Let's bring down the expenses
and that is good for all.

1561
01:24:25,355 --> 01:24:27,115
Hey idiot, what are you overacting?
Hey stop.

1562
01:24:27,946 --> 01:24:30,919
It's a problem for us if the
issue becomes big. Let's go.

1563
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:37,639
Come. Let's go meet Swathi.

1564
01:24:39,218 --> 01:24:41,658
NRI boy leading a normal
life with 83 rupees

1565
01:24:41,718 --> 01:24:44,076
per day leaving his
Billions of properties.

1566
01:24:44,136 --> 01:24:47,838
25 Year old NRI student doing MBA
from local Nava Bharat College

1567
01:24:47,898 --> 01:24:50,639
is catching up all
eyes with his ideals.

1568
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:53,857
Aravind son of a big
businessman settled in America

1569
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:57,039
and his cousin let go their
Billions of properties

1570
01:24:57,099 --> 01:24:59,044
and luxurious lives in America

1571
01:24:59,104 --> 01:25:01,719
and came down to India
for knowing their roots

1572
01:25:01,843 --> 01:25:06,720
and spending just 83 rupees a day
and are leading a very normal life.

1573
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:09,476
We request the present
generation youth in dreams

1574
01:25:09,536 --> 01:25:12,999

change be seeing them.

1575
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:15,199
Sir, they are here.

1576
01:25:17,999 --> 01:25:20,919
You did a great thing and why are you
hiding like you did something wrong?

1577
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:22,479
Please.

1578
01:25:34,923 --> 01:25:35,651
Thank you.

1579
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:38,075
Our College has got a good
name as you're studying here.

1580
01:25:38,135 --> 01:25:40,199
We are proud of you, guys
Thank you, Sir, thank you.

1581
01:25:42,032 --> 01:25:43,917
Bro, that was great bro.

1582
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:46,439
Hey bro, what's up man?

1583
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:51,239
Oh, thank you.
Wait, wait! You owe me a party.

1584
01:25:51,299 --> 01:25:52,605
Party, for what?

1585
01:25:52,665 --> 01:25:54,250
After you spoke so that day,

1586
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:55,602
Neha explained it all about

1587
01:25:55,662 --> 01:25:57,855
why you came to India and why
you're leading such lives.

1588
01:25:57,879 --> 01:25:59,153
Oh, did she say?

1589
01:25:59,213 --> 01:26:01,293
I said the same matter
to my uncle in media and

1590
01:26:01,353 --> 01:26:03,119
he wrote the news about
you like an article.

1591
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:05,033
Oh, is this the girl?
Oh, that's the matter.

1592
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:06,919
Thank you, thank you, thanks a lot
Thank you.

1593
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:25,490
Good morning Sir.

1594
01:43:25,516 --> 01:43:27,636
It's an honor and prestigious
to be here in your show.

1595
01:43:27,672 --> 01:43:31,330
Don't think the questions would
be simple by pleasing me so.

1596
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:34,410
This is a show making big politicians
also to pee in their dresses.

1597
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:39,033
When question rapidly,
you'll die to give answers.

1598
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:42,090
What are you watching? Hello.

1599
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:44,810
Yes! I mean it's written
Coffee with Kishore here.

1600
01:43:44,987 --> 01:43:46,770
Kishore is here and
where is Coffee?

1601
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:48,410
I understood your bad time.

1602
01:43:48,650 --> 01:43:50,330
Sit for a while and I'll arrange.

1603
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:51,730
Thank you You throw it, Sir.

1604
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:56,443
A hearty welcome to Coffee
with Kishore show exploring

1605
01:43:56,503 --> 01:43:59,250
the inner feelings of
celebrities with our third eye.

1606
01:43:59,664 --> 01:44:01,570
Our morning guest for
today is none other.

1607
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:06,611
The people who became overnight
celebrities with their lifestyle,

1608
01:44:06,671 --> 01:44:09,696
Mr. Aravind and Bala
Shanmugam alias Basha.

1609
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:11,851
Welcome to my show.

1610
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:13,130
Oh, thank you, Sir.

1611
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:14,600
Give it to me.

1612
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:16,690
Aravind, what's your age?

1613
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:17,690
25

1614
01:44:17,823 --> 01:44:20,183
That means you were in
America for 25 years,

1615
01:44:20,243 --> 01:44:22,210
you ate in America and
roamed around in America.

1616
01:44:22,421 --> 01:44:25,207
Then, why did you suddenly
feel to let go all your wealth

1617
01:44:25,267 --> 01:44:29,530
and come, like never
before in these 25 years?

1618
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:32,170
I want an answer Sir
you are on live.

1619
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:35,810
Come on tell me Sir,
you are on live.

1620
01:44:36,913 --> 01:44:39,209
Ba. Ba. Baba.

1621
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:40,489
Baba, you mean Rajinikanth Baba?

1622
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:41,050
No.

1623
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:42,170
Baba.

1624
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:43,370
Baba.

1625
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:44,730
Baba.

1626
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:48,169
So, Baba came in a dream
one day and said,

1627
01:44:48,736 --> 01:44:51,770
"Look Aravind, none of these wealth,
girls or the cars are permanent."

1628
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:55,530
He said not even one Dollar
will follow me when I'm gone.

1629
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:59,184
He preached real happiness is
to be in a simple life among

1630
01:44:59,244 --> 01:45:00,890
all and to help a few.

1631
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,809
So, as his follower, I followed him
and came down like this to India.

1632
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:07,424
Oh! So, you are Baba devotee now.
I mean followers.

1633
01:45:07,484 --> 01:45:07,950
Yeah.

1634
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:11,009
Okay, what if Baba appears suddenly
and gives you 10 Million rupees?

1635
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:12,009
As of now, right now.

1636
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:12,770
What's that question, Sir?

1637
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:14,566
Take that Million and
immediately to America.

1638
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:15,423
Hey, hey, hey.

1639
01:45:15,483 --> 01:45:17,481
What? Basha was saying something.
Come on tell me.

1640
01:45:17,676 --> 01:45:18,555
Bank of America.

1641
01:45:18,615 --> 01:45:19,070
What?

1642
01:45:19,411 --> 01:45:21,610
That isn't America Bank
dude, Bank of America.

1643
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:25,227
We shall share the interest we get
by doing a fixed deposit of that

1644
01:45:25,287 --> 01:45:27,649
amount in that bank to the people
every month. He's saying that.

1645
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:29,569
Yes, I was saying the same.
Perfect, he said it correctly. Yes.

1646
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:30,730
Why do you stammer like that?

1647
01:45:30,863 --> 01:45:32,880
Hmm! When you say something,
Basha is supporting the same.

1648
01:45:32,904 --> 01:45:33,904
I understand everything.

1649
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,586
This is Coffee with
Kishore this week

1650
01:45:56,864 --> 01:45:58,864
and we shall meet with
another celebrity next week.

1651
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:00,956
Looks like you came
well prepared,

1652
01:46:02,716 --> 01:46:03,716
give the mikes and go.

1653
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,689
I expected Hey, hey Neha! Neha!

1654
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:18,449
It must be very important. Hey,
it'd be important, it'd be important.

1655
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:19,730
Okay. I'll put in speaker mode.

1656
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:21,290
Hello.

1657
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:24,388

Hey, for what?

1661
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:30,250
You know what?

1662

You are there in the list of the

1663
01:46:33,483 --> 01:46:36,970

What's there in that money Neha,
is it anything I haven't seen?

1669
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:55,970
Winning is important. Okay,
which channel is that?

1670
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,680
Came to know about Youth
Icon Contest details,

1671
01:46:58,953 --> 01:47:01,353
what's the selection procedure?
How do you select the winner?

1672
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:03,218
SMS voting has already started.

1673
01:47:03,278 --> 01:47:04,646
Once the contest period is over,

1674
01:47:04,706 --> 01:47:06,890
we select the winner based
on the polls we get.

1675
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:10,010
Sir, will you really give
five Lakhs by winning?

1676
01:47:11,622 --> 01:47:12,622
Yes, we will give.

1677
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:16,451
Still, what are you asking for
money, what's the matter?

1678
01:47:17,742 --> 01:47:19,447
We are wishing to send
a few poor people

1679
01:47:19,507 --> 01:47:20,907
from our colony on a Kasi trip Sir.

1680
01:47:20,956 --> 01:47:23,226
So, we can give this money to
them if we win this contest.

1681
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,650
Hmm, very good thought!

1682
01:47:25,567 --> 01:47:26,810
Competition is very tough.

1683
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:30,849
Looking at the polls till now
Bhargav is in the first position,

1684
01:47:30,909 --> 01:47:33,890
Vaishnavi is in the second position
and you are in the third position.

1685
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:38,817
This is the good opportunity
for we should go to America.

1686
01:47:38,877 --> 01:47:40,090
We will use this. Yes.

1687
01:47:42,131 --> 01:47:43,690
Hey, dad is calling.

1688
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:45,370
Hello Dad.

1689
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:47,770
What son, attendance is low?

1690
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:50,666
Are you still around the studios or
will you be going even to the college?

1691
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:51,858
If you do the same,

1692
01:47:51,918 --> 01:47:54,175
I'll have to stop even the 5000
every month I'm giving now.

1693
01:47:54,199 --> 01:47:55,570
No need, you have that with you.

1694
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:57,293
I'll be back in the
US in week days.

1695
01:47:57,490 --> 01:47:58,850
See you soon dad, bye.

1696
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:01,930

01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:07,530

Hello Bhargav.

prestigious award.

1707
01:48:21,771 --> 01:48:25,969
Once you win this, we can
this as your popularity

1708
01:48:26,284 --> 01:48:28,730
to those asking about
your experience.

1709
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,770
Definitely, Sir, I'll
be on the same job.

1710
01:48:36,809 --> 01:48:38,850
Two plate 'Idli.' Sir, 50 rupees.

1711
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:41,130
Do you have it?

1712
01:48:45,127 --> 01:48:46,250
One plate is enough.

1713
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,930
One plate?

1714
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:48,050
Hmm!

1715
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:52,068
Let's share I can understand.

1716
01:48:52,128 --> 01:48:52,770
Come on

1717
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,094
I ordered one plate of snacks, right?
How long will you take?

1718
01:48:54,118 --> 01:48:55,049
They're cooking Sir,
wait for two minutes.

1719
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:56,050
Give me first.

1720
01:48:58,286 --> 01:49:00,130
Hey, stop, stop it here.

1721
01:49:01,959 --> 01:49:03,408
Sir, sir, sir.

1722
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:08,290
Hello,

1723
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:09,596
Why are you getting up, be seated?
(WE CAME HERE TODAY)

1724
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:11,106
Be seated (AS A PART OF MR.
BHARGAV'S TOUR.)

1725
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:12,969
(THIS IS NETAJI NAGAR
FROM HIS CONSTITUENCY)

1726
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:14,210
Hello, are you fine? Fine, Sir.

1727
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:17,650
Please take, Sir Hello.

1728
01:49:19,658 --> 01:49:20,710
Give it here.

1729
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:21,610
Idli is famous, Sir

1730
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:25,500
(WE ARE SEEING MR. BHARGAV MIXING
INTO THE COMMON PUBLIC RIGHT NOW)

1731
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,730
(AND EATING AT THE ROADSIDE
CARTS NOW, DEEPTHI.)

1732
01:49:27,930 --> 01:49:32,409
(HE CAME HERE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE
PROBLEMS OF NETHAJI NAGAR PUBLIC)

1733
01:49:32,469 --> 01:49:35,850
We know that Bhargav is standing
first in the Youth Icon contest.

1734
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:39,810
Also as the elections are nearing up,
this tour has gained an importance.

1735
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:52,650
Give water. Sir.

1736
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:01,290
Bro, we got popularity
by luck till now Hi.

1737
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,408
But not so from now,

1738
01:50:02,468 --> 01:50:04,610
we should go ahead all over
with a plan and strategy.

1739
01:50:04,834 --> 01:50:06,148
We should catch the
eyes of the public.

1740
01:50:06,172 --> 01:50:07,452
Then our popularity
increases and

1741
01:50:07,501 --> 01:50:08,985
we will get more votes in
the Youth Icon Contest.

1742
01:50:09,009 --> 01:50:10,610
We shall be on that
job from today, okay?

1743
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:11,810
Okay. Deal?

1744
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:32,610
"If you and your deeds are liked,
they'd carry you with high ratings."

1745
01:50:37,770 --> 01:50:42,730
"They won't give you a time even to
eat with a tight schedule of selfies."

1746
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:50,369
"You shall enhance this
name and fame going ahead."

1747
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:55,570
"You should enhance when all this
craze and public are around us."

1748
01:50:57,810 --> 01:51:02,406
"Come on dude, whole media
should go crazy about us."

1749
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:07,893
"Hey dude, this should
be the Wikipedia."

1750
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:10,940
"He's become an
overnight celebrity"

1751
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,570
"and celebration has
started in his life."

1752
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:28,515
Avi Sir, Avi Sir, salutes.

1753
01:51:29,033 --> 01:51:30,033
Hello.

1754
01:51:30,332 --> 01:51:32,970
Hello grandpa, why
did you come here?

1755
01:51:33,306 --> 01:51:35,266
You should somehow save us, son?

1756
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:36,410
Me?

1757
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:38,426
You know it all,

1758
01:51:38,486 --> 01:51:40,782
they are leaving all waste from
Chemical Factory into the river.

1759
01:51:40,806 --> 01:51:43,952
Kidneys of our kids are spoiling right
in childhood by drinking that water

1760
01:51:44,012 --> 01:51:45,582
and we have back pain problems.

1761
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:48,146
We've been screaming to close that
down from the past four years.

1762
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:50,650
Neither the Government nor the
opposition is caring about this.

1763
01:51:50,690 --> 01:51:54,491
While we were waiting for the person
to help us, you came at the right time.

1764
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:57,770
What can I do, grandpa?

1765
01:51:57,970 --> 01:51:58,970
Only you can do it, son.

1766
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:02,067
If a guy like you supports
our hunger strike tomorrow,

1767
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,430
all would talk about our protest.

1768
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:06,290
Then, even the Government
would come down.

1769
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:09,690
We can't stay here and can't
live by going elsewhere.

1770
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:11,650
We came with
confidence on you, son.

1771
01:52:13,654 --> 01:52:14,458
Okay.

1772
01:52:14,610 --> 01:52:18,250
Actually, we have another program
committed for these two days.

1773
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:20,610
So, maybe we can't come. Sorry.

1774
01:52:22,328 --> 01:52:27,395
You should come somehow, Sir.
We will all be waiting for you.

1775
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:40,130
Uncle.

1776
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:47,570
Uncle, uncle you
should come for sure.

1777
01:52:49,587 --> 01:52:50,890
Please.

1778
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:05,610
Chemical Factory.
Should be closed.

1779
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:07,270
Government not responding
about problems.

1780
01:53:07,392 --> 01:53:08,009
Down, down.

1781
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:08,889
Chemical Factory.

1782
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:09,649
Should be closed.

1783
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:11,507
Government not responding
about problems.

1784
01:53:11,567 --> 01:53:12,250
Down, down

1785
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:15,210

Sir Tell me

1797
01:53:42,034 --> 01:53:43,330
I'm at the Chemical Factory Sir.

1798
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:46,224
Many people gathered this time.
I don't understand what to do.

1799
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:47,917
This isn't the first time
that they are doing so.

1800
01:53:47,941 --> 01:53:49,910
You know well about
how to clear them all.

1801
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:52,930
Correct Sir, I wouldn't have
called have in general.

1802
01:53:53,288 --> 01:53:55,970
But that NRI Aravind came
this time in their support.

1803
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,890
Brother. Look at there.

1804
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:06,218
We are now seeing NRIs
Avi and Basha sitting

1805
01:54:06,242 --> 01:54:08,242
in the hunger strike in
support to the slum people.

1806
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:14,490
Government not responding
about problems Down, down.

1807
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:18,289
Hey dude, come sit.

1808
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:20,890
Hey, I thought you won't come
but you've arrived greatly.

1809
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:24,210
Is everything fine?
It'd be great now.

1810
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:25,874
These just passing statements

1811
01:54:25,934 --> 01:54:28,209
opposing the Government
policies till date are now

1812
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:30,333
taking part directly in the
protest being done opposing the.

1813
01:54:30,357 --> 01:54:32,110
Government can be
said as a sensation.

1814
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:34,753
Come on, let's know all the
details now going to them.

1815
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:37,290
Hey Avi, is this strike
and all required now?

1816
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:39,850
Hey, by doing so our votes
increase in the contest.

1817
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:41,427
Even our slum people's
problem will be solved.

1818
01:54:41,451 --> 01:54:42,451
Do what I said you first.

1819
01:54:42,893 --> 01:54:43,893
Down, down.

1820
01:54:43,944 --> 01:54:45,650
One minute. Aravind please.

1821
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,840
Unresponsive government!
Down, down!

1822
01:54:49,084 --> 01:54:52,771
You came to these poor people.
Are you supporting their fight?

1823
01:54:53,559 --> 01:54:55,054
What for the poor people, Sir?

1824
01:54:55,196 --> 01:54:56,610
Poor is not poor
without the poor.

1825
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:58,064
I'm the poor. I'm for the poor,

1826
01:54:58,124 --> 01:55:00,565
I'm for the poor. I'm
the poor, I'm the Basha.

1827
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:04,678
We haven't come as they are poor
people or that they are from our slum.

1828
01:55:04,702 --> 01:55:06,626
We came as we know the
intensity in their problem.

1829
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,988
We won't move from here unless
we find a solution for this.

1830
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:10,378
Come on folks.

1831
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:13,970
It'll be a problem for us to do
lathi charge without a reason Sir.

1832
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:16,033
Reason

1833
01:55:17,730 --> 01:55:20,410
(SLOGANS REPEAT)

1834
01:55:36,558 --> 01:55:38,130
Hey Aravind, come here.

1835
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,280
Unresponsive government!
Down, down!

1836
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:43,120
Chemical factory!
Should be removed!

1837
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:51,850
Stop, stop.

1838
01:55:59,050 --> 01:56:02,170
What idiot, came with this labor batch?
Is it a build up in front of the media?

1839
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:06,695
I'm giving you half an hour time.
Remove these tents and leave from here.

1840
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:12,933
Clear everyone, make it fast.
Hello Sir,

1841
01:56:15,208 --> 01:56:17,354
you are saying to clear even when
we have the Police permission.

1842
01:56:17,378 --> 01:56:18,378
Who called you?

1843
01:56:19,744 --> 01:56:20,780
How much did they give?

1844
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:22,810
What and with whom are
you talking, idiot?

1845
01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:23,870
Hey Avi!

1846
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:25,889
This isn't legal Sir. I'm
gonna call my lawyer.

1847
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:27,050
Call idiot, call.

1848
01:56:38,481 --> 01:56:39,481
Charge.

1849
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:50,130
Sir, please sir stop.

1850
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:51,190
Stop.

1851
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:03,650
Please sir stop.

1852
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:06,102
Sir,

1853
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:36,930
Grandpa,

1854
01:57:41,984 --> 01:57:43,216
Granny.

1855
01:57:43,419 --> 01:57:44,447
Granny.

1856
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:51,770
Grandpa,

1857
01:57:52,450 --> 01:57:53,450
Grandpa,

1858
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:49,387
As the Police did
lathi charge on

1859
01:58:49,447 --> 01:58:51,651
on the slum people who
were protesting against

1860
01:58:51,711 --> 01:58:54,770
the Chemical Factory in peace,
the strike is turned into havoc.

1861
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:56,390
Avi?

1862
01:58:56,450 --> 01:58:58,618
Slum public is into a fire in regards

1863
01:58:58,678 --> 01:59:00,890
to the attack and
arrest of Avi and Basha.

1864
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:02,159
Votes for Avi unexpectedly

1865
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:05,250
are growing heavily in the Youth
Icon Contest after the arrest.

1866
01:59:05,450 --> 01:59:06,766
Aravind in the third position

1867
01:59:06,826 --> 01:59:10,258
crossed Vaishnavi Krishna and
is into the second position.

1868
01:59:21,006 --> 01:59:25,049
He's born in a Billionaire's family
but thought to live as a common man.

1869
01:59:25,109 --> 01:59:28,610
He's born far away in America and
came to India searching for his roots.

1870
01:59:28,918 --> 01:59:32,628
His sympathy on the society
and the problems around him

1871
01:59:32,688 --> 01:59:35,910
turned into a curse
and led to his arrest.

1872
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:37,963
He is none other
than Aravind Prasad.

1873
01:59:38,714 --> 01:59:41,450
This guy seems to get very
popular with this now Sir.

1874
01:59:41,810 --> 01:59:44,970
He looks to even win as
the Youth Icon too, Sir.

1875
01:59:50,530 --> 01:59:55,251
We should know how to win even
after losing and that is politics.

1876
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,730
We did a mistake dude.

1877
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,730
I didn't expect this to happen.

1878
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:11,250
No idea how is poor Deevena.
Grandpa and granny.

1879
02:00:11,690 --> 02:00:12,690
Oh, shut up Avi.

1880
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:15,770
We had been to the strike just to
win votes in Youth Icon contest.

1881
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:18,948
Don't feel like Mahatma Gandhi saying

1882
02:00:19,008 --> 02:00:20,648
whether the kid is
fine or granny is fine.

1883
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:23,970
Because of you, we came from
the US jail to India Jail now.

1884
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:26,610
Hey, we both did this
planning together right?

1885
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:28,770
Why do you now talk like
it's just my mistake alone?

1886
02:00:29,490 --> 02:00:30,249
Okay, you say man.

1887
02:00:30,309 --> 02:00:32,290
You say what to do next
and we shall do the same.

1888
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:11,130
So Mr. Youth Icon,
advance congratulations.

1889
02:01:12,797 --> 02:01:17,341
You are going to win Sakshi Youth
Icon Contest, internal information.

1890
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:18,890
Tomorrow is the announcement.

1891
02:01:19,463 --> 02:01:20,589
Once the event is over,

1892
02:01:20,784 --> 02:01:23,384
I'll send you both to America in
business class with my own money.

1893
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:24,890
Thank you.

1894
02:01:26,281 --> 02:01:28,490
But, after one month.

1895
02:01:31,262 --> 02:01:33,139
What you need to do for
this one month is,

1896
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:35,204
should be with me in
my election campaign

1897
02:01:35,264 --> 02:01:36,690
and talk great about me.

1898
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:45,090
Not just that, on the Youth Icon stage
you should say I am your inspiration.

1899
02:01:46,570 --> 02:01:51,130
You can go back to America
only when you do as I said.

1900
02:01:52,252 --> 02:01:53,252
What if I don't say?

1901
02:01:58,530 --> 02:01:59,730
There's another plan for that.

1902
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:02,850
Sir.

1903
02:02:06,251 --> 02:02:07,650
FIR copy of your
arrest in the US,

1904
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:14,870
real truth why you both came to
India, your passports seized

1905
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:16,410
for not paying the hotel bills

1906
02:02:20,850 --> 02:02:23,930
evidence that you tried to exchange
fake notes in your same area.

1907
02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:26,060
When I show all these
to the public,

1908
02:02:26,848 --> 02:02:30,690
the public who clapped till
date will hit you with slippers.

1909
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:37,453
I know you'll do as I said.

1910
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:40,330
You are clever, right?

1911
02:02:41,010 --> 02:02:42,514
He'll say, Sir, he'll
definitely say.

1912
02:02:42,574 --> 02:02:43,610
Hey Basha.

1913
02:02:44,932 --> 02:02:46,419
We don't have a choice.

1914
02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:50,970
So, deal.

1915
02:03:08,114 --> 02:03:12,874
Like every year, the stage is ready for
the Youth Icon Award felicitation.

1916
02:03:12,954 --> 02:03:15,314
Let's now watch the
award ceremony in live.

1917
02:03:18,994 --> 02:03:21,784
And now is the time to
announce the winner

1918
02:03:21,844 --> 02:03:25,474
of Sakshi TV's Youth
Icon of the year award.

1919
02:03:26,474 --> 02:03:29,954
It's none other than Mr.
Aravind Prasad.

1920
02:03:30,265 --> 02:03:33,314
That God himself is saying that no
light will come into our lives,

1921
02:03:33,374 --> 02:03:35,234
why do we need these
worships now?

1922
02:03:35,754 --> 02:03:38,514
Saying so, how can we be without
lighting the lamp at God?

1923
02:03:46,234 --> 02:03:47,554
Bro.

1924
02:03:59,594 --> 02:04:03,933
And now Sakshi group CEO will
be presenting the award of the.

1925
02:04:03,993 --> 02:04:09,039
Youth Icon of the year to Mr.
Arvind Prasad. My man.

1926
02:04:15,474 --> 02:04:17,314
Congrats and the
stage is all yours.

1927
02:04:23,229 --> 02:04:26,090
Aravind Prasad, Youth icon!

1928
02:04:27,419 --> 02:04:29,179
It gives a kick just by
listening to it boss.

1929
02:04:33,123 --> 02:04:35,963
Born somewhere in America, coming to
India and living like a common man,

1930
02:04:36,014 --> 02:04:38,702
saving every rupee and
adjusting in 83 rupees a day,

1931
02:04:38,762 --> 02:04:41,242
you gave me this award as I stood
an inspiration for the youth.

1932
02:04:42,311 --> 02:04:44,754
But in my opinion, you shouldn't
be giving this award to me.

1933
02:04:45,914 --> 02:04:46,914
Mr. Bhargav Deserve this.

1934
02:04:52,576 --> 02:04:54,274
Why is he saying
that Bhargav's name?

1935
02:05:01,557 --> 02:05:05,442
Why because I being in this
competition have voted to him.

1936
02:05:07,222 --> 02:05:09,730
More than us being Billionaires and
coming to live like a common man,

1937
02:05:09,754 --> 02:05:11,591
Mr. Bhargav leaving his business
worth Billions in Dubai

1938
02:05:11,615 --> 02:05:15,189
and coming here to
live as a common man.

1939
02:05:16,714 --> 02:05:18,114
He is not like a
regular politician.

1940
02:05:19,375 --> 02:05:20,375
He is an icon.

1941
02:05:22,047 --> 02:05:24,007
In fact, when people like
Bhargav are in politics,

1942
02:05:24,938 --> 02:05:26,994
many more from us will
become youth icons.

1943
02:05:44,074 --> 02:05:45,494
What wrong with him?

1944
02:05:45,554 --> 02:05:46,634
I didn't understand that.

1945
02:06:46,994 --> 02:06:48,914
Sorry Bhargav, I can't.

1946
02:06:58,034 --> 02:06:59,034
Sorry guys.

1947
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,408
You may be thinking
about what is Aravind

1948
02:07:02,432 --> 02:07:03,872
talking after coming onto the stage.

1949
02:07:05,349 --> 02:07:08,794
What I just spoke before are not
the words coming from my heart.

1950
02:07:11,567 --> 02:07:14,994
The words said by Bhargav that I
should be speaking only this way.

1951
02:07:15,194 --> 02:07:17,660
Hey, what's he talking?
What exactly is he saying?

1952
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:19,874
I hid a few facts from
you all, for so long.

1953
02:07:21,996 --> 02:07:24,902
As you all think, I haven't come
here to live as a common man

1954
02:07:25,158 --> 02:07:27,314
leaving aside Billion
of wealth and comforts.

1955
02:07:28,717 --> 02:07:29,986
When my dad sent me
away from home thinking

1956
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:32,450
I'd get bettered at least by
sending me to India, I came here.

1957
02:07:33,938 --> 02:07:37,019
From the day I came here, I always
thought about how to escape from here

1958
02:07:37,282 --> 02:07:39,402
but never thought even for
a second to stay back here.

1959
02:07:40,994 --> 02:07:44,314
And this is the truth
that I have been hiding.

1960
02:07:46,928 --> 02:07:49,669
At such a time, Bhargav knowing
all the truths about us came.

1961
02:07:50,412 --> 02:07:52,652
And asked me to say great about
him in the award function

1962
02:07:53,048 --> 02:07:55,033
and to support in his
election campaign.

1963
02:07:55,213 --> 02:07:56,609
Do something to him guys.

1964
02:07:56,669 --> 02:07:59,153
Chakri, get that live stopped
first, stop that live.

1965
02:07:59,487 --> 02:08:02,834
He said to send us to America with
his money if we do as he said.

1966
02:08:03,407 --> 02:08:06,994
He threatened to expose the truths
before you all if I don't do.

1967
02:08:08,816 --> 02:08:12,052
All my lies till date were just for
my selfish purpose and for me to live.

1968
02:08:13,727 --> 02:08:16,168
But if I listen to Bhargav
now and do as he said

1969
02:08:17,167 --> 02:08:19,607
and go back to America, it'd be
like I'll be cheating you all.

1970
02:08:21,538 --> 02:08:23,222
I want to stop just at the lies

1971
02:08:24,957 --> 02:08:25,997
and I don't want to cheat.

1972
02:08:27,517 --> 02:08:28,824
Instead, to cheat and win,

1973
02:08:29,335 --> 02:08:31,295
I wish to lose in front
of you all by being loyal.

1974
02:08:37,683 --> 02:08:38,757
You are right dad,

1975
02:08:39,606 --> 02:08:41,366
you did a great thing
by sending me to India.

1976
02:08:43,345 --> 02:08:46,041
I don't know what I learned
from the College I studied

1977
02:08:46,717 --> 02:08:48,677
but I learned a lot in the
University named India.

1978
02:08:49,375 --> 02:08:52,375
I never used to think even for a second
while spending thousands of Dollars.

1979
02:08:52,502 --> 02:08:55,183
But after coming to India
I thought a hundred times

1980
02:08:55,243 --> 02:08:58,034
before spending every
hundred rupees.

1981
02:08:59,838 --> 02:09:02,794
I came to know the
value of money.

1982
02:09:07,298 --> 02:09:10,963
Before, when the food wasn't
tasty or if my order comes late,

1983
02:09:11,023 --> 02:09:12,234
I used to throw that.

1984
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,216
But after I came here,

1985
02:09:14,763 --> 02:09:16,714
I slept drinking water
when I had nothing to eat.

1986
02:09:18,510 --> 02:09:20,110
I came to know about
the value of hunger.

1987
02:09:23,106 --> 02:09:25,034
I never used to
repeat a dress I wear.

1988
02:09:26,075 --> 02:09:29,904
But now, when I'm washing the same
clothes and wearing them again,

1989
02:09:30,820 --> 02:09:32,740
I feel some strange
attachment growing with them.

1990
02:09:33,749 --> 02:09:35,509
I came to know about the
value of things too.

1991
02:09:37,234 --> 02:09:38,593
While in America.

1992
02:09:38,777 --> 02:09:41,081
I too like a guy from there I too used
to think like am I good, how am I,

1993
02:09:41,105 --> 02:09:42,808
how much am I earning,
did I develop and so on

1994
02:09:42,832 --> 02:09:46,533
I was always focused just about myself
because that's the American life.

1995
02:09:46,751 --> 02:09:48,951
But after coming to India, a
girl used to call me uncle,

1996
02:09:49,019 --> 02:09:51,673
a grandpa called grandson,
a friend called dude,

1997
02:09:51,674 --> 02:09:54,314
kids called as uncle and they
called with different names.

1998
02:09:55,225 --> 02:09:58,794
I coming as Aravind here, got
so many identities mixed up.

1999
02:09:59,461 --> 02:10:05,514
You aren't neighbour dude, you're
my best friend, love you dude.

2000
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:09,154
Though I was nothing to them,
they made me one among them.

2001
02:10:09,661 --> 02:10:12,141
I then understood that we
can get great happiness

2002
02:10:12,892 --> 02:10:15,212
in life even from relationships
and not just from luxuries.

2003
02:10:16,879 --> 02:10:18,719
We got cheated when in
the greed of more money.

2004
02:10:19,275 --> 02:10:21,034
We cheated when in
greed for big name.

2005
02:10:22,116 --> 02:10:23,264
I selfishly thought to
get more votes in the.

2006
02:10:23,288 --> 02:10:25,834
Youth Icon contest by using
the slum people's strike.

2007
02:10:26,442 --> 02:10:30,834
But I felt ashamed when they risked
their lives for us not to get beaten.

2008
02:10:35,154 --> 02:10:36,274
But I felt ashamed.

2009
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:42,737
I wasn't of any use to you all,

2010
02:10:43,789 --> 02:10:46,011
but you were of great
help for a change in me.

2011
02:10:47,829 --> 02:10:49,323
Thanking you all for that,

2012
02:10:50,464 --> 02:10:52,474
I'm sorry for hurting you
all with such a big lie.

2013
02:10:57,806 --> 02:10:58,857
I'm sorry.

2014
02:11:07,445 --> 02:11:08,994
And one last thing
before I leave,

2015
02:11:10,554 --> 02:11:11,708
Because of the Chemical factory.

2016
02:11:11,732 --> 02:11:14,052
Netaji Nagar people are suffering
a lot from so many years.

2017
02:11:14,113 --> 02:11:15,893
Thus I request the
Government on behalf of.

2018
02:11:16,555 --> 02:11:18,875
Netaji Nagar people to immediately
close down that factory.

2019
02:11:32,524 --> 02:11:34,114
And one last thing
before I leave,

2020
02:11:36,754 --> 02:11:37,669
Jai Hind!

2021
02:11:37,729 --> 02:11:38,874
Jai Hind!

2022
02:11:42,948 --> 02:11:44,034
Super, Avi.

2023
02:11:59,717 --> 02:12:01,574
Neha, I'm sorry.

2024
02:12:01,634 --> 02:12:02,634
Enough.

2025
02:12:10,354 --> 02:12:13,474
The controversy of young leader
Bhargav shook the Assembly today.

2026
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:16,344
The opposition has made the Government
face hard times in this matter.

2027
02:12:16,368 --> 02:12:18,860
As there's been strong opposition
over this even from the public,

2028
02:12:18,884 --> 02:12:21,670
we can say great pressure is
mounted upon the ruling party now.

2029
02:12:22,434 --> 02:12:25,064
No chance to leave the guy
alive, who made me fool.

2030
02:12:27,898 --> 02:12:30,955
You've written an end even before
your political life has started.

2031
02:12:31,293 --> 02:12:32,834
Why's this arrogance
still for you?

2032
02:12:33,674 --> 02:12:38,554
Do as said by senior first, if you
want to be at least like a son.

2033
02:12:40,132 --> 02:12:41,132
Go.

2034
02:12:44,634 --> 02:12:48,417
I feel ashamed to say
as the party President

2035
02:12:48,477 --> 02:12:53,314
that an evil man like
Bhargav is in this party.

2036
02:12:53,354 --> 02:12:57,754
I am suspending him
immediately from the party.

2037
02:13:04,994 --> 02:13:08,634
When we are on the public's side,
the public will be on our side.

2038
02:13:08,878 --> 02:13:11,206
I inform that Government
will close down that.

2039
02:13:11,454 --> 02:13:15,954
Chemical Factory and will sue
the Management in court.

2040
02:13:25,354 --> 02:13:28,314
So kids, your dad's
salary is 10000 rupees.

2041
02:13:28,995 --> 02:13:30,835
He gave you 5% from that
to you as pocket money

2042
02:13:31,142 --> 02:13:32,577
and what is your pocket money?

2043
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:35,554
It's less than what
your dad gave you, son.

2044
02:13:45,674 --> 02:13:46,674
Dad.

2045
02:13:52,354 --> 02:13:53,354
Dad.

2046
02:14:00,270 --> 02:14:03,434
I sent you as you should change, son I
didn't expect you to change so much.

2047
02:14:03,834 --> 02:14:05,395
Enough son, come
let's go back now.

2048
02:14:06,378 --> 02:14:07,738
I don't feel like
to come back dad.

2049
02:14:08,724 --> 02:14:11,660
Avi, I sent for you to know
the value of hard work.

2050
02:14:11,938 --> 02:14:13,738
But not for you to be in
continuous hard times

2051
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:16,586
I'll get my degree in the next
two years and I too will come.

2052
02:14:22,711 --> 02:14:24,071
Then, what shall I
say to your mom?

2053
02:14:25,579 --> 02:14:28,594
Say that I got a fair Telugu
girl and I'll be coming with her.

2054
02:14:29,635 --> 02:14:32,376
Who this girl?

2055
02:14:41,597 --> 02:14:46,314
Neha, not knowing how to become close
to you, I said a lie on the spot.

2056
02:14:46,741 --> 02:14:49,594
I'm saying the same
what I said that day.

2057
02:14:49,994 --> 02:14:51,987
Other than the small
mistakes unknowingly,

2058
02:14:52,295 --> 02:14:54,450
it's enough that you believe
I'm not as bad as you think

2059
02:14:54,474 --> 02:14:55,474
I'll believe.

2060
02:14:57,914 --> 02:15:02,162
But like uncle coming home
drunk and hitting aunt,

2061
02:15:02,222 --> 02:15:05,113
you shouldn't behave
so after our marriage.

2062
02:15:05,114 --> 02:15:06,334
Then I'll believe.

2063
02:15:06,795 --> 02:15:09,434
What's hitting aunt? I
don't drink at all.

2064
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:13,274
Dad, that is.

2065
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:20,190
What you used me like this?

2066
02:15:20,243 --> 02:15:23,787
Just to impress the girl
You sinner!

2067
02:15:29,354 --> 02:15:31,594
Oh no, so many entries by the
time I finished my bath?

2068
02:15:38,594 --> 02:15:42,113
It's ok uncle, give me his passport
size photo if you have any.

2069
02:15:42,114 --> 02:15:43,114
Why man?

2070
02:15:43,234 --> 02:15:44,874
Why do you ask like
you don't know?

2071
02:15:45,069 --> 02:15:46,238
He anyways doesn't seem
to be coming back

2072
02:15:46,262 --> 02:15:47,478
to the US after his
course is finished.

2073
02:15:47,502 --> 02:15:50,112
If we arrange for his
Aadhar card, Ration card, Pan card,

2074
02:15:50,172 --> 02:15:51,833
and wedding card if possible by then,

2075
02:15:51,834 --> 02:15:53,513
he can permanently settle here.

2076
02:15:53,514 --> 02:15:55,754
Stop that rubbish! Come
on, click a photo.

2077
02:15:56,114 --> 02:15:58,233
Your aunt will feel happy by sending
this to her. Come on dear, come

2078
02:15:58,234 --> 02:16:00,034
I haven't done this work
only for your family.

2079
02:16:07,674 --> 02:16:10,794
Aravind exposing his truths saying he's
not eligible to be the Youth Icon.

2080
02:16:11,154 --> 02:16:12,434
Mr. Niranjan, have
you seen this?

2081
02:16:12,634 --> 02:16:16,278
I've already said to you that
he's a cheap third grade character.

2082
02:16:16,338 --> 02:16:16,954
You didn't believe me.

2083
02:16:17,274 --> 02:16:19,930
Not just that sir, it seems a girl
got connected to him in the college.

2084
02:16:19,954 --> 02:16:21,634
They both are seen
together all around.

2085
02:16:21,714 --> 02:16:22,473
Is it? Yes.

2086
02:16:22,474 --> 02:16:24,393
Did he flatter? Did he set?

2087
02:16:24,394 --> 02:16:27,314
See Sir, all these
are 420 cases.

2088
02:16:27,354 --> 02:16:30,473
Their job is to cheat either the
society if possible or the girls.

2089
02:16:30,474 --> 02:16:31,911
We've been calling
them to our channels,

2090
02:16:31,935 --> 02:16:33,975
washing their feet and making
them into celebrities.

2091
02:16:34,104 --> 02:16:37,154
Sir, I'm telling you, we have to
eliminate these people from the society.

2092
02:16:37,194 --> 02:16:39,234
Ban them Sir, they are
a threat to democracy.

2093
02:16:39,514 --> 02:16:41,514
Sir, they are young.

2094
02:16:41,634 --> 02:16:45,034
They'd either love, roam around or do
whatever they wish. Why for us, Sir?

2095
02:16:45,474 --> 02:16:47,994
Ours are the lives where five
EMIs get cut before the 5th.

2096
02:16:48,114 --> 02:16:49,554
Let's look after our work Sir.

2097
02:16:50,154 --> 02:16:52,794
Not that Mr. Niranjan, you
should have a basic social.

2098
02:16:53,874 --> 02:16:55,034
Waste!

2099
02:16:55,154 --> 02:16:57,634
No one can save this
society Sir, no one.

2100
02:16:57,794 --> 02:17:01,194
Law takes its own course and Mr.
Niranjan keeps throwing.

2101
02:17:02,234 --> 02:17:04,394
Come on throw it, sir, Take
