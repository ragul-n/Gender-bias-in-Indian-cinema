00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,700
Ahh

414
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,620

415
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,450

416
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,160
Your friend only told me!

417

He also told me that if i don't accept

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,870

419
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,870
Suicide?

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,790
Ahh!!! Suicide??? no.. no!!!

421
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,370
Aadi i have to tell you something very important

422
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,120
I had a very bad past,

423
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,750
my parents got seperated when i was young

424
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,000
If i accept your love then my mother will not like it!!

425
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,370
I will be the lamp of your house..

426
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,830
I will fill-in your father's shoes

427
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,500
I will take care of you like a princess

428
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,330
Oh god this is so lenghty!!

430
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:00,790
Aadi.. Aadi..

431
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,790
Aadi.. Aadi..

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,620
Ahh!!!

433
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,790
Did you understand?

434
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,910
If i don't say this in english, i will never get her..

435
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,000
Love has that power

436
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,950
You can do it..

437
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,120
You will tell..

438
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,910
You will definetly tell..

439
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,870

440
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,410

442
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,540
Thanks for understanding Aadi..

443
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,540
Hmm...

444
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,250
Bye...

445
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,120
Is this a love story?

446
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,080
God i need to thank you for this!!!

447
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,040
Aadi..

448
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,200
There is a temple nearby shall we just drop by?

449
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,410
What Aadi..

450
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,410
Just because you coudn't communicate in english

451
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,410
You just left her?

452
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,000
Hmm!!

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,870
Oh you studied in kannada medium?

454
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,910
My father didn't send me to Kannada medium

455
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,200
but he sent me to English medium

456
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,370
When i was studying, only girls use to talk in english.

457
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,410
We boys were like soldiers..

458
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,450
When it comes to our language and girls

459
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,200
We will protect and respect it.

460
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,330
Hmm!!! so all your love stories are done right?

461
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,040
Ya done with high school..

462
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,450
Ahh!!

463
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,950
Next is PUC..

464
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,120
PUC is life's turning point

465
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,500
You can't go behind girls in PUC

466
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,040
I went behind

467
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,750
Did you?

468
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,410
But no girl fell for me!!

469
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,080
That's why you are an engineer

470
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,330
or else you would be a road romeo

471
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,660
Okie tell me what happened further.

472
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,120
After my PUC i got into engineering ...

473
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,950
Shall i guess what happened there?

474
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,250
You want to guess this also?

475
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,580
Hmm

476
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,040
Okie tell

477
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,620
In engineering there will be so much to study

478
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,160
Internals, externals & projects

479
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,330
you won't have time for anything

480
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,830
Hello stop it there!!

481
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,120
You can say whatever you want isn't it?

482
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,450
who said there wont be any time?

483
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,750
Why should anybody tell?

484
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,250
Parents sent you to engineering to study

485
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,000
Not to fall in love

486
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,660
Shhh!! this is a temple!!

487
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,790
I know!!

488
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,450
I only got you here!!

489
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,000
Lord! has he loved any one in engineering ??

490
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,620
Tell me..

491
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,410
How will you tell

492
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,080
You have closed the doors of the temple and gone out!!

493
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,750
I will only ask him!

494
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,580
Did you love anyone while doing engineering?

495
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,160
Ahh!!!

496
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,790
Just because he has the support of Aadi

497
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,450
that Vijay is acting too much.

498
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,120
We should hit him guys, we should hit him..

499
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,790

I had a bet, that he won't hit

532
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,370
We love you Aadi...

533
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,750
Ahh!!!

534
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,370
Wicket it damp because it rained

535
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,080
Its difficult to bat

536
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,540
Hey it was 6 balls 6 runs..

537
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,870
You wasted 5 balls, now its 1 ball 6 runs.

538
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,540
I told you not to bat..

539
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,620
you wont listen to anyone

540
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,330
Hey talk softly, don't embrass me!!

541
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,040
You want runs right, i will hit..

542
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,790
Put this mud.. we will get power..

543
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,290
Hit.. hit.. yes!!

544
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,660
You are acting as if you lost first time

545
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,160
If i don't over act now, they won't let me bat again

546
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,450
God knows how many have lost their money

547
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,500
Betting on you

548
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,370
Prajwal is coming with goons..

549
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,000
Is it?

550
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,620
Hey what's your problem?

551
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,160
Ahh!!!

552
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Look Aadi.. my Ash..

553
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,620
Ah..

554
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,500
My Sushma..

555
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,000
This guy has gone blind

556
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,660
and he compares her to Aishwarya rai!!

557
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,910
Is she so beautiful that you both have to fight for her?

558
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,160
Love is blind dude!!

559
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,290
Correct Vijay!!

560
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,450
Not love you both are blind..

561
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,700
I don't care Aadi.. It has to be decided today.

562
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,620
Dude from 3 years they are committed like love birds.

563
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,620
Why are you troubling them?

564
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,790

888
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,700

But it was oneway!!

890
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,580

No problem, they will agree in my family

899
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,370

00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,040

1036

1041
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,790
Tell me what it is?

1042
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,080
Aadi..

1043
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,450
I thought you will get 1 lakh salary..

1044
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,200
And you will settle down soon..

1045
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,950
I had dreamt so many things..

1046
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,660
But what can we do with 20,000Rs?

1047
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,080
Ohh, are you worried for this?

1048
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,250
I have already enquired..

1049
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,410
If i work double shift, they will pay me double

1050
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,120
Just see, how i will settle down..

1051
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,830
Hmm then fine!!

1052
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,120
But you have to come every weekend to meet me!!

1053
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,870
Obviously!

1054
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,410
Friday night i will be off to mysore.

1055
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,500
In our town,

1056
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,040
In our area, in our street

1057
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,250
We are the hero...

1058
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:47,410
But,

1059
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,830
Once we come to Bangalore we will realise

1060
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,330
We are Nothing!!!

1061
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,410
Vijay and me stayed together

1062
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,700
We use to go to office together

1063
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:00,750
I had sworn an oath before coming to Bangalore!!

1064
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,330
I had only one aim...

1065
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,870
To settledown soon..

1066
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:07,160
I started working double shifts and over time...

1067
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,080
Months just passed..

1068
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,700
When everyone had left..

1069
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,700
I was still working...

1070
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,750
I use to be not aware, if it's a day or a night!!!

1071
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,120
My life's biggest accomplishment was

1072
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,040
Buying a second hand car from my own money!

1073
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,040
And it gave me immense satisfaction.

1074
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:26,870
It's nice?

1075
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,330

Nobody has fallen for me !!

1126
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,500
If she falls on you or if you fall on her, both are tough...

1127

I spoke to her yesterday..

1183
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,300

1188
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,010
Call him once..

1189
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,180

1190
00:57:58,510 --> 00:57:58,970

You please stop pressurising me to settle down..

1210
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:30,800
One can't just settle down immediately..

1211
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,800
It takes some time!!

1212
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,180

I am going mad!

1276
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,260
My parents are pressurising me for marriage

1277
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,680
And i also met a guy in the party

1278

01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,600
You got a chocolate to surprise!

1280
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,640
I don't think this will work Aadi!!

1281
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:24,680
Hey Joo,

1282
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,260
Don't talk nonsense..

1283
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,260
You asked me not to come,

1284
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,390
But I came there,

1285
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:29,970

Have you gone mad!

1289
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,930

She is gonna get married itseems..

1297
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,800
It's her usual drama!

1298
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,680
She has gone mad!

1299
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,890

Forget it..

1302
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,390
Why to spoil your mood..

1303
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:11,850
It has become common for me.

1304
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,970
Hey Aadi

1305
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,470
Can you just sleep!

1306
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:01,050

Can't you just sleep!

1308

Aadi..

1309
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,220
What's wrong with you?

1310
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,970
I just can't see you like this..

1311
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,260
She won't answer my calls..

1312
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:23,140
She won't reply to my messages..

1313
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:25,100
It's been 3 months, i haven't spoken to her!!

1314
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,760
She clearly told you..

1315
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,350
That she will marry someone else..

1316
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:30,930
How can she marry somebody?

1317
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,350
Can she live without me?

1318
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,680
I have gone mad not talking to her..

1319
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,180
I feel like ending my life!!

1320
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:37,680
Hey

1321
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,390
Just don't talk nonsense!

1322
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,470
What else can i do?

1323
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,970
She had so many dreams about our future!!

1324
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:44,600
But now??

1325
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:46,850
No chance buddy!!

1326
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,760
She can't live without me!!

1327
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,180
You have seen, how good we were!

1328
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,600
If we discuss, everything will be fine!!

1329
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,260
Forget it Aadi..

1330
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,260
This won't work!!

1331
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,550
If Sushma says the same..

1332
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:01,350
Will you let her go so easily?

1333
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,390
What can i tell you, if you say this?

1334
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,550
Okie what shall we do now?

1335
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:07,720

01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:09,800
Tomorrow is her birthday..

01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,640
We will go to mysore.

1339
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,680
No Aadi..

1340
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,600

I will do whatever you say..

1344
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,350
Ok?

1345
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,180
She will be expecting me!!

1346
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:21,640
Is she expecting you?

1347
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:22,930
Okie, Let's go

1348
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,470

01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,180
You have to do as i say.

1350
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:27,850

I have messaged her, she will come.

1354
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,350
Where will she come..?

1355
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:39,430

1356
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,640
Hello..

1357
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:17,850

1358
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,390
What's you problem?

1359
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:21,890
You ask her first..

1360
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,850
Look, where he is sleeping!!

1361
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,010
Aadi...

1362
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,300
Hey Aadi??

1363
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:47,930
Viju did Joo come?

1364
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:48,800
Where will she come?

1365
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,390

1366
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:52,470

01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:12,550

1368
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:24,890

01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,800
Hi Joo.. Happy birthday!!

1372
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:38,300
Why din't you come?

1373
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,930
Did i tell you that i'm coming?

1374
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:41,350
I had messaged you?

1375
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,550
Did i reply?

1376
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:44,550
I had arranged everything for you!!

1377
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:44,930
Hello..

1378
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,100
Who are you to arrange for me??

1379
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:48,850
How many times should i tell you?

1380
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,100
I have moved on!!

1381
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,180
Joo..

1382
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,640
You are talking in anger..

1383
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:54,890
If we sit and talk, we can..

1384
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,640
It doesn't matter, how we discuss!

1385
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,720
I have decided!!

1386
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:59,050
Joo..

1387
01:06:59,050 --> 01:06:59,760
Try to understand..

1388
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,390
Please....

1389
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,300
Don't trouble me..

1390
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,800
Hope you are sensible enough!!

1391
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,100
Come let's go!!

1392
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:52,800
Don't you have self respect?

1393
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,140
Is she the only one in the town?

1394
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,680
You don't worry,

1395
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,470
I will search a better girl for you.

1396
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,720
Hello..

1397
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,470
You are the reason for this one.

1398
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,430
You just keep quiet.

1399
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,140
Hey, what did i do?

1400
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,050
She asked me the number,

1401
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:04,550
I just gave it

1402
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,010
Who knew, all this will happen.

1403
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,550
I am not able to take this!!

1404
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,140
Hey,

1405
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,140

1406
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:15,850
Call her..

1407
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:16,850
Aadi

1408
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:18,720
If you have any self respect..

1409
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,430
If you are a real man..

1410
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,550
Give it back to her!!

1411
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,720
Don't call her

1412
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:24,050
Hey, call her..

1413
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,430
Told you not to call..

1414
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,220
I am telling you to call..

1415
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,470
I told you not to..

1416
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,800
Give it me.. i will only call her!!

1417
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,430
Sushma don't call her..

1418
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:34,510
Don't call her.. hey..

1419
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,220
Hey Aadi

1420
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,800
How many times should i tell you?

1421
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,600
Why are you calling me again and again?

1422
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:39,600
Look..

1423
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,260
If you trouble me again,

1424
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,930
I will complain to my parents!

1425
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:43,300
Look..

1426
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,050
You marry anyone you want.

1427
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:46,890
Ohh!!

1428
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:48,600
I will never call you again!!

1429
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,220
I am also not waiting..

1430
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,100
One more thing...

1431
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:52,510
What is it?

1432
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,680
Scold her... don't leave her...

1433
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,510
Give it back..!!

1434
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,970
Never call me again!!

1435
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,180
You think i will call you?

1436
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,140
Never!!!

1437
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,220
Hmm!!

1438
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,720
How nicely you gave back to her!!!

1439
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:10,970
You just see..

1440
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,800
He will be in Mysore tomorrow!!

1441
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,600
Hmm!!

1442
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:14,970
Aadi..

1443
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,550
If there is problem in love, we can solve it..

1444
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:19,220
But if the person whom you love is only a problem

1445
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,510
it can never be resolved!!

1446
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,180
I have spoken to a girl already..

1447
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:23,720
Hmm!!!

1448
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,300
You just marry her and settle down.

1449
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,470
Ahh!!

1450
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:27,760
Aadi..

1451
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,600
You have suffered enough.

1452
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:32,010
I am doing this for your own good.

1453
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,890
You trust me right?

1454
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,260
You will listen to what i say right?

1455
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,760
Tomorrow you go and meet her!!

1456
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,050
Does Vijay have any common sense?

1457
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,550
You had still not recovered from Joo's torture!!

1458
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,850
How can you go and meet another girl?

1459
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,300
I had promised Vijay that i will do whatever he says!

1460
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:53,600
But

1461
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:56,680
I was definitely not ready for it..

1462
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,390
Why did i go there..?

1463
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:03,760
I really don't know..!!

1464
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,100
Nothing was happening as per my wish..

1465
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,930
So, had decided to go with the flow i guess.

1466
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,510
The girl whom vijay wanted me to meet was..

1467
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:14,550
Nidhi..

1468
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,010

If we talk in English..

It feels like i am talking to a stranger..

1543
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,050
But if we talk in kannada..

1544
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,600

01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,780
I thought we will chat for a while

1689
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,820
Ok, we will talk.. will talk..

1690
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,610
I will just remove the seat belt..

1691
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:14,280
She said we will talk for a while..

1692
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,320
I thought she would...

1693
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,900
Talk for 5 to 10 minutes...

1694
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:20,240
I should've realised when she removed the seat belt

1695
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,400
This train would never stop!

1696
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,950
I knew girls talk a lot...

1697
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:31,650
But never thought to this extent!

1698
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:33,200
How much she talks!

1699
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,740
How much can i acknowledge!

1700
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:37,320
Atlast I was saved by a divine intervention

1701
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:41,530
I am tired of talking...

1702
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,320
I am hungry, let's have pani puri?

1703
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,280
Ya we will have...

1704
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,150
Oh!! it's late

1705
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:47,360
I guess we won't find pani puri

1706
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,400
You said you are hungry?

1707
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,240
Let's go check..

1708
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:50,900
Okie!!

1709
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,200
I think he is closing...

1710
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,450
We won't get...

1711
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,820
Wait, i will go and ask him..

1712
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,110
It's okie forget it...

1713
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,610
I will be back!

1714
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:15,780
Bro...

1715
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:16,900
Ahh..What?

1716
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:18,450
Give me one plate pani puri..

1717
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:19,900
Pani puri is over...

1718
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:20,650
It's closed..

1719
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:21,820
Just one plate...

1720
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,240
No, it's closing time...

1721
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:25,280
A girl has asked something for the first time

1722
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,990
It's a shame, If i don't buy her...

1723
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:27,900
Hmm...

1724
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,740
Who is she...

1725
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,450
Your love?

1726
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:32,280
No...

1727
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:33,320
Friend?

1728
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,610
No...

1729
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:35,820
Then what?

1730
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:36,780
I have put a ring...

1731
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:37,820
What!?

1732
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:39,030
Putting ring?

1733
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,780
Hmm..!

1734
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,990
Please give bro..

1735
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:44,450
What is he telling? ring and all?

1736
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,150
I can only give one plate!!

1737
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,360
don't ask for more

1738
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:49,570
Hmm...

1739
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:50,200
Hmmmm...!!

1740
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,280
I guess you like panipuri a lot?

1741
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,280
Hmm, I would die for it.

1742
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:03,530
Oh great!!

1743
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:04,860
I will bring you some more?

1744
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,030
"I can only give one plate! don't ask more!"

1745
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:08,610
Hmm...

1746
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,820
I think it's enough...

1747
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,990
Even i think so

1748
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,990
Pani puri was yum!!!

1749
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:26,070
I can eat pani puri all day..

1750
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,280
Give it to me in the morning, evening

1751
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,070
I can eat forever and never get bored of it!

1752
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,990
Are you feeling sleepy?

1753
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:33,200
Noooo...

1754
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,280
Let me know, if you are sleepy.

1755
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:39,570
The train was that fast with no fuel...

1756
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:41,650
Imagine now, when it is full!

1757
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:45,200
How far can i control?

1758
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,240
I tried for sometime...

1759
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:47,950
But...

1760
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:49,280
I couldn't...!

1761
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:52,610
Ahh...!!

1762
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:53,860
Aadi..?

1763
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:55,820
Aadi..?

1764
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,280
Hello..?

1765
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,200
Aadi..?

1766
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,200
You dozed off?

1767
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,150
Hmm..

1768
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:04,490
sleep..

1769
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:16,780
God!! i don't like girls who talk a lot!

1770
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:19,950
Girls should be like me, silent and decent

1771
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,320
Without knowing anything about Nidhi,

1772
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,950
How can you just put the ring?

1773
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,070
When people can tie knots blindly...

1774
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:28,570
A ring is not a big deal!

1775
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:29,780
Rightly said bro...

1776
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,110
My dad hasn't understood my mom,

1777
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:32,610
Inspite of being married for 5 years...

1778
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:33,240
See..!!

1779
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,700
Hey! how old are you?

1780
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,490
13.

1781
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,530
Then you said it's been 5 years..

1782
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:38,200
That's my dad's 2nd wife!!

1783
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:38,950
Ohh!!

1784
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:44,820
Usually, it's very painfull to go through breakups...

1785
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,320
It's hard to explain the agony...

1786
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,650
Once Nidhi entered my life

1787
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:48,740
everything seemed to settle down...

1788
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,070
I was actually feeling better.

1789
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,650
It's okie atleast you were happy! brother bill.

1790
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,150
How much is it?

1791
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:56,110
100

1792
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,490
Ask her for tips, don't forget, okie brother.

1793
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,320
It's 100Rs, pay him

1794
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,200
Ahh?

1795
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:06,200
How rude, you make a student to pay the bill?

1796
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,530
Take it.

1797
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:09,400
Tips?

1798
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,780
Ahh? Anything more!

1799
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:11,740
I want some...

1800
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,360
Ahh?

1801
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,150
Nothing just leave

1802
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:14,860
Aadi...

1803
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,360
What happened next?

1804
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:18,110
Next...

1805
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,610
On my birthday!

1806
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:20,740
Come i will tell you.

1807
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,570
Hey...

1808
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:32,900
Your phone is ringing.

1809
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,320
See who is it.

1810
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,780
You need an assistant to check your phone!!

1811
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:38,820
It's Nidhi!!

1812
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:44,530
Hello..

1813
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:45,490
Can you come out.

1814
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:48,610
It's 12 o'clock

1815
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,030
she must have come to wish on your birthday!!

1816
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:52,780
Won't you wish me?

1817
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,490
Let her wish you first!

1818
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,570
Wear something nice

1819
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:00,990
Ohh!

1820
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:02,990
You dropped the cake?

1821
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,280
What happened?

1822
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,360
Are you crying?

1823
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:07,780
What happened?

1824
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,820
Super figure!!

1825
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:27,400
At this hour!

1826
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,990
I think she is a call girl.

1827
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:31,650
What's your rate?

1828
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,110
She is crying

1829
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,070
Dude...

1830
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,900
She is just a kid...

1831
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,070
Correct dude.

1832
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,700
Come on guys

1833
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,070
Hey boycut...

1834
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:52,240
Who is that?

1835
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,150
See dude

1836
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:36,820
We didn't rape her...

1837
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,950
We just tried to rag...

1838
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,570
Hey dude

1839
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:58,280
Let's run away...

1840
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,700
Let's run away

1841
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,320
Hey let's run away.. run away!!

1842
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,490
Ahh..

1843
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:06,610
Stab him...

1844
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,490
Stab him...

1845
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:08,400
Stab him...

1846
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,700
Stab him.. stab him.. stab.. stab..

1847
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,490
Stab him...

1848
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:13,070
Don't leave, stab him...

1849
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,280
Please stop!!

1850
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:56,360
I had enough...

1851
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:07,360
Can't make out that you fight so well!

1852
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,490
I bought this cake with so much love...

1853
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,240
Everything went in vain.

1854
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,320
One minute i will be back...

1855
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,030
Hmm..

1856
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,110
Where did you go?

1857
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:34,990
How is the cake?

1858
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,490
Aww.. It's very cute?

1859
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:37,900
Shall i cut it?

1860
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:38,950
Blow it.

1861
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,150
Happy birthday!

1862
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,280
Thank you.

1863
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:54,450
If you don't mind, can i ask you something?

1864
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:55,360
Ya please..

1865
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,150
You knew about my ex girlfriend...

1866
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,320
Yet...

1867
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,110
Why did you accept my proposal?

1868
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:08,280
I heard, how sincere you were in love

1869
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:11,990
And how tolerant you were with her tantrums.

1870
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:15,740
You even slept on the road the whole night in mysore

1871
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,450
Who told you?

1872
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,200
Your friends.

1873
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:20,490
Ohh!!

1874
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,240
I feel so sorry for you.

1875
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:28,780
If you can give so much love, for such a girl...

1876
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:31,360
Me being such a nice girl...

1877
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:31,990
Ahh??

1878
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,030
I could imagine, how much you might love me...

1879
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,450
So i agreed.

1880
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:37,400
Hmm...

1881
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,360
Can i take a picture of this ring?

1882
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:44,490

1886
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,400
I will put it as WhatsApp Dp

1887
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,360
Dp?

1888
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,570

1889
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:09,610
Nothing, go ahead

1890
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:11,070
Hmm...

1891
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:25,070

01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,650
You neither let me sleep in the moring nor in the night...

1894
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:33,990
First change that ring tone

1895
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:40,360
Hello.

1896
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:41,530

1898
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,490
Ahh!!

1899
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,700
I have come to Bangalore, specially for your birthday

1900
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,070
I will share you the location

1901
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:51,860
See you at sharp 10, bye

1902
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,820
What happened? why are you shell shocked?

1903
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,900
It's Joo's call!!

1904
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,150
Ahh... What!?

1905
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:00,970
Hello..

1906
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,600
Are you planning to meet her?

1907
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,760
You only tell him.

1908
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,470
She has come all the way from Mysore to meet you,

1909
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:13,890
It won't be nice if you don't go.

1910
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:14,720
Hello

1911
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,470
You have no idea about him!

1912
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:17,800
If you allow him..

1913
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,640
You please go...

1914
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:19,300
Ahh?

1915
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:28,470
Aadi..

1916
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:30,140
Happy birthday!

1917
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:35,350
Come with me..

1918
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,720
Take this

1919
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,600
Cut it

1920
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:53,760
Aadi

1921
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,350
I have something to talk...

1922
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,850
We will go inside the restaurant?

1923
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,890
No, we can talk in the car.

1924
01:30:58,890 --> 01:30:59,850
Okie, come

1925
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,760
Aadi

1926
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:03,760
We will sit in your car..

1927
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:04,720
Hmm.

1928
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,100
Why Aadi?

1929
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,430
Are you not comfortable?

1930
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,550
Nothing like that.

1931
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:13,970
Seriously?

1932
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:15,300
Hmm..

1933
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:16,680
Give me your hand.

1934
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,050
Give it..

1935
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,680
This is not the way to hold a girl's hand!

1936
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:30,260
You should hold it like this!

1937
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:32,640
Take a picture now

1938
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:36,300
Why Aadi?

1939
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,800
You don't need a picture with me?

1940
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,800
You forgot me so soon?

1941
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,140
Aadi

1942
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,300
I know

1943
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,510
I have done a big mistake.

1944
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:49,470
I have humiliated you...

1945
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,470
You can punish me for it...

1946
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:55,760
But please don't say that, you will leave me...

1947
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:59,010
We have been together for so many years...

1948
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,600
Everytime i made a mistake,

1949
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,850
it's you who always compromised...

1950
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,550
You know i am a big fool...

1951
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:09,260
I have realised your value now!

1952
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:11,220
Please, give me one last chance

1953
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,970
If i make a mistake again...

1954
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:14,600
You can leave me and go

1955
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:15,930
I won't ask you anything!

1956
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,050
Don't you think i deserve one more chance?

1957
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:18,930
Please Aadi?

1958
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:19,600

1962
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:25,350

I will call.. you please go..

1967
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,390
Aadi...

1968
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:52,890
All these apologies are just drama...

1969
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:55,010
She is just jealous,

1970
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:56,470
that you have put a dp with another girl.

1971
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,220
We are together from a month,

1972
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:02,300
But you were with her for 4 years...

1973
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,890
If you want her, please decide..

1974
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:06,890
Don't regret it later!

1975
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:09,760
It's not like i won't feel bad..

1976
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:12,390
I will be fine in few days!!

1977
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:25,350
What did you decide?

1978
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:28,550
Her name is Nidhi...

1979
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,930
She loves me a lot

1980
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:36,600
I can't betray her...

1981
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,350
Oh!!!

1982
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:40,050
So can you betray me?

1983
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,050
You just forgot me so soon...

1984
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,140
And you are already with another girl

1985
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,010
What kind of a person are you?

1986
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,850
Have you told her about me?

1987
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,970
Or you are just playing around with her too...

1988
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,430
God i can't believe you did this to me!

1989
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,760
I was just fooled!

1990
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,970
I feel ashamed that i loved a person like you...

1991
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,220
You such a cheat i can't...

1992
01:33:58,220 --> 01:33:58,640
Hey!!!

1993
01:33:58,850 --> 01:33:59,970
First talk in Kannada!

1994
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:05,640
Are you ashamed that you loved me?

1995
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:08,930
You were ashamed of my salary...

1996
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:10,300
Of my gifts...

1997
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,300
You were embarrassed to sit in my car...

1998
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:16,470
You can't eat paneer butter masala in a normal hotel

1999
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:18,350
You can only eat it in a 5 star hotel...

2000
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:20,850
You think people who eat in a normal hotel,

2001
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:21,760
are not human beings?

2002
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,850
You just know to have fun with your father's money

2003
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:25,640
How will you know the value of hard working people...

2004
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:28,390
Today you have come to celebrate my birthday

2005
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:31,140
On your birthday, I was waiting for you the whole night

2006
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,140
Where were you on that day?

2007
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:35,680
You were not bothered if i'm dead or alive from past 6 months

2008
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,180
I just put one picture...

2009
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,640
and you couldn't take it...

2010
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,550
Hey Aadi

2011
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,510
just shut up okie!

2012
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,180
Hey just keep the phone *****!!

2013
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,140
What??

2014
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,100
Ahh!!

2015
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,640
whether i am dead or alive!!

2016
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,720
Aadi!!

2017
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:15,890
What Aadi, you used such words?

2018
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,390
So many days of frustration,

2019
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:18,550
Just came out...

2020
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:19,470
I shouldn't have scolded her.

2021
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:21,760
No no, what you did was right!!

2022
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:25,970
I find Nidhi extrordinary!!

2023
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,760
She loves you a lot!

2024
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,930
She gives you time!

2025
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:30,180
She gets you Breakfast!

2026
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:32,390
She gets you cake in the midnight!

2027
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:34,550
She also allows you to meet your ex girlfriend!

2028
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,800
OMG...

2029
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,390
She is just perfect...

2030
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,760
You just think about this...

2031
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,470
Can any girl...

2032
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,550
Be so perfect?

2033
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:45,930
I think she is just faking!

2034
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,680
Actually even i was confussed!

2035
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,470
Correct!!!

2036
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:49,930
Yes...

2037
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,510
Yes...

2038
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:51,970
What you have felt is right...

2039
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:52,930
You are on the right path!!

2040
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:53,890
What did you do next?

2041
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,390
What i did was...

2042
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,260
Ahh?

2043
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:57,220
With that confusion...

2044
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,180
In that confusion?

2045
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,100
I just...

2046
01:35:59,100 --> 01:35:59,760
You just?

2047
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,760
I just married her!

2048
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,600
What?

2049
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,760
You married her?

2050
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,470
You just said you were confused?

2051
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:05,800
We boys are like that...

2052
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,260
We will get married in confusion...

2053
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,970
Or we get confused after marriage!

2054
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,720
What aadi?

2055
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,850
When i asked you, you said you are single!

2056
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,930
You were feeling so proud of guessing everything right,

2057
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:16,220
and i did't want to dissapoint you.

2058
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:17,720

2059
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,930
Actually, You have to listen to my first night story...

2060
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:21,350
Ahh??First night!!

2061
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,300
Ya...

2062
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,470
It's an extraordinary episode

2063
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:24,890
you will be just blown away!

2064
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,510
Please don't fall on my feet...

2065
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:49,510
I just wanted to keep the glass...

2066
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,470
Ohh!!

2067
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,720
Are you not interested?

2068
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,180
No..

2069
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,140
Are you not?

2070
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:19,300
Not that "No"

2071
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,010
I have..

2072
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:23,180
Oh you have!!

2073
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:27,850
Yes i have.

2074
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:35,850
Every boy would have dreams about their first night

2075
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:36,850
And you?

2076
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,470
What are you smelling?

2077
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:49,010
Even i had...

2078
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:49,720
Actually!

2079
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,010
I had it since i was a kid!

2080
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:54,180
Since you were kid?

2081
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:58,140
Doesn't mean i was a small kid...

2082
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:01,050
I was kind of young...

2083
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:02,680
What sort?

2084
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:05,180
That we sit far away like this...

2085
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:06,970
and spend the whole night?

2086
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,300
Oh sorry!!

2087
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,600
It's not like that...

2088
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:15,890
Then how is it?

2089
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:21,800
Ahh..

2090
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,720
It's nothing new for you right...

2091
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,850
No...

2092
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:28,050
This is new for me too...

2093
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:29,050
Oh!

2094
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:31,260
You haven't done anything so far?

2095
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:34,100
Not like i haven't done anything..

2096
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,010
Have you done?

2097
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,260
No no...

2098
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,050
I haven't done anything of that sort!!!

2099
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:39,430
Then what all have you done?

2100
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,390
Ahh??

2101
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:51,220
Can you give me two minutes?

2102
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,180
Hmm..

2103
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,180
That's why they say,

2104
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:06,890
Never love till you marry...

2105
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:09,260
or marry the one you loved!

2106
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,350
Come on!!

2107
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:10,220
I am so pretty!

2108
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,800
You are so lucky to get me!!

2109
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,220
My eyes, colour, height,smile..

2110
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,100
Ah I also cook so well...

2111
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:17,220
You also eat my head...

2112
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:18,430
And trouble me so well...

2113
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:21,100
You have fooled me by saying great things about you.

2114
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,550
You are a big fraud!

2115
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:23,550
Am i a fraud?

2116
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:25,300
I have seen your ex girlfriend

2117
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,100
You have seen EX.. have you seen double EX?

2118
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,300
Double EX?

2119
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,970
Double EX is the one before EX

2120
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:35,100
Her name is Reema..

2121
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,510
My high school love

2122
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,510
If she removes her glasses

2123
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:39,850
She looked like Titanic heroine

2124
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,930
Her eyes.. her lips.. her smile!

2125
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:43,850
Ahhh!!

2126
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:45,760
She use to hardly talk...

2127
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:46,640
Why?

2128
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,850
Was she dumb?

2129
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:50,260
I meant her words were precious...

2130
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:51,970
She would never blabber like you...

2131
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:53,390
Oh i see!

2132
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:55,180
Let me see her picture, if you have?

2133
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:56,800
I haven't seen her since 15 years...

2134
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:59,220
Why do you need all this?

2135
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:01,100
Workout well and maintain you health!

2136
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:02,140
Hmm...

2137
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:03,850
I have already decided...

2138
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:06,010
From now on full workout, full diet...

2139
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:07,050
Ahh super!!

2140
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,890
I am extremely hungry...

2141
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:10,010
Let's eat Panipuri

2142
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:11,050
Ahh?

2143
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,260
Panipuri!

2144
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:13,890
Not necessary...

2145
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:15,470
There is apple in the car, you can have it.

2146
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,180
Am i a patient to eat apple?

2147
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:18,470
I want to have only panipuri.

2148
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:19,390
I said no...

2149
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:20,390
I said i want

2150
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:21,930
I said no..

2151
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:23,180
Don't be stubborn

2152
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:24,390
Ohh...

2153
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:27,550
Before marriage, didn't you get panipuri from a closed stall?

2154
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:28,930
After marriage, did you lose interest?

2155
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:29,970
You guys are all the same

2156
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:31,930
you all should be shot with a gun!

2157
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,600
If something goes wrong...

2158
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:00,390
Shall i get you one more plate?

2159
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,140
You never listen to me...

2160
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:10,720
I told you not to eat...

2161
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,220
panipuri...panipuri...panipuri...

2162
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:16,850
It's not because of panipuri, i puked

2163
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:18,640
Oh!

2164
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:21,050
You puked because i asked you to eat apple?

2165
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:23,180
No..

2166
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:24,600
Oh!

2167
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,720
You puked because i fed you?

2168
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,220
No..

2169
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,890
Hmm now i am sure...

2170
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:34,720
You might have puked 
as you married some like me...

2171
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:36,140
Hmm...

2172
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,510
That might be possible!

2173
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,760
What is with you?

2174
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:00,550
Are you sure?

2175
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,180
Really?

2176
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:10,430
Everything changed once Nidhi entered my life.

2177
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:12,010
It seems like a dream!

2178
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,140
Thank you Nidhi...

2179
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,390
For loving me so much...

2180
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:17,640
Every moment i spend with you...

2181
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:18,850
Is beautiful!!!

2182
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:40,850
Good morning...

2183
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:44,100
Morning Nidhima...

2184
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:46,680
Tea for me

2185
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:48,050
Hmm..

2186
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:50,850
Isn't it late for office?

2187
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:52,350
Why didn't you wake me up?

2188
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,550
You quit your job...

2189
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:57,050
And take rest at home...

2190
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,050
Why should i quit?

2191
01:47:59,050 --> 01:48:00,010
I wonâ€™t

2192
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,640
I told you to quit

2193
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:02,890
I told you i won't

2194
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:04,050
You should listen to what i say...

2195
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:05,640
You shouldn't talk back for everything...

2196
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:07,850
Is this how you treat a pregnant wife?

2197
01:48:07,850 --> 01:48:10,720
You start scolding me, early in the morning

2198
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,510
When did i scold?

2199
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:15,890
Hmm.. drama begins!!!

2200
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,640
Have tea..

2201
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:27,850
I thought you won't take tea, as you were upset...

2202
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,050
What happened?

2203
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:33,890
Women work till their 7th month during pergnancy...

2204
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:34,220
Hmm.

2205
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:36,760
But you are asking me to quit right now...

2206
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:40,100
You don't want any trouble in office

2207
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:41,760
so you are trying to lock me up at home?

2208
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:42,720
I know,

2209
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:46,640
You have planned to have an affair at office

2210
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:47,600
Ohh!

2211
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:49,800
Are you done?

2212
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,430
Can i talk now?

2213
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:54,680
People who love their wife casually

2214
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,300
will let them work till 7th month

2215
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,390
Since I love my wife a lot...

2216
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,970
So i am asking you to quit early!!

2217
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:03,300
Nothing like that...

2218
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,640
You are just fooling me..

2219
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:08,220
Do you need so much of tension

2220
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:10,010
and pressure in office?

2221
01:49:10,510 --> 01:49:12,180
You are like my princess!!!

2222
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:13,720
Be like princess at home

2223
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,550
You ask me whatever you want...

2224
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:16,220
hmm..

2225
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,470
You will get me whatever i ask?

2226
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:18,350
Ahh?

2227
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:19,850
Will you get me panipuri whenever i ask?

2228
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:23,430
That's all?

2229
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:24,260
Done!!

2230
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,390
What Mr Aditya?

2231
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:28,760
You seem to be very happy?

2232
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:29,890
I will be a father soon...

2233
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:31,510
Oh wonderful!

2234
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:32,640
Congratulations!!

2235
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:33,430
Thank you sir.

2236
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:35,180
I have also a good news for you!

2237
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:36,140
Good news?

2238
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:37,430
You have been promoted!!

2239
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:38,970
Ohh!!!

2240
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:39,720
Thank you...

2241
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:40,970
It's a new project,

2242
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:43,260
You will have to put in little extra hours of work

2243
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,260
but you will be paid well!

2244
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:45,600
Sure sir, no problem,

2245
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,220
I will do it!

2246
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:47,010
Good...

2247
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:48,140
All the best to you!

2248
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:48,930
Thank you sir.

2249
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:55,720
Hello.

2250
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,680
Hi Nidhima!

2251
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,350
Hi...

2252
01:49:57,640 --> 01:49:58,600
There is a good news for you

2253
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,970
Are you quiting your job?

2254
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:00,930
Hey monkey!

2255
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:02,180
I got promoted...

2256
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:03,720
Congrats!!!

2257
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,930
Why are you reacting like that?

2258
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,010
What happened?

2259
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:08,970
I am getting bored alone

2260
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:11,180
I know my sweetheart is getting bored

2261
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:12,970
So, we will go out for lunch

2262
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:15,010
Vijay, Sushma don't know the good news

2263
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:15,970
We will surprise them!

2264
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:17,760
Ahh..Lunch?

2265
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:19,010
Ok.. ok.. Where shall we go?

2266
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:21,140
Chinese? Continental? Italian? North indian?

2267
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:22,100
South indian? Naati style?

2268
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:22,800
Hello.. hello..

2269
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,890
You got so excited about eating out that you got up.

2270
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,890
How did you know that i got up?

2271
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:28,510
I know everything...

2272
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,550
Be ready,

2273
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:30,510
I love you..

2274
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:31,640
Ok.. bye..

2275
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,260
Love you..

2276
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:36,290
Viju...

2277
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:39,000
What would be the surprise?

2278
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,620
Mostly, Joo might have called...

2279
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:43,040
I was just kidding...

2280
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:47,120
Hey...

2281
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,410
They are coming...

2282
01:50:50,330 --> 01:50:52,750
Both are wearing similar t-shirt.

2283
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,500
Something is written on the t-shirt.

2284
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,660
Mom to be...

2285
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:56,370
Dad to be...

2286
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:58,080
It's Mom to be, dad to be!

2287
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,040
Ahh!!

2288
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,000
Come.

2289
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,080
Hey!!!

2290
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,120
Is it true?

2291
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,000
No...

2292
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,500
We are just loafing around wearing it.

2293
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:07,540
Hey donkey

2294
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:09,080
Congratulations

2295
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:10,250
Congrats

2296
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:11,160
Thank you

2297
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,870
I will just go to rest room and come.

2298
01:51:12,870 --> 01:51:13,830
Hmm okie..

2299
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:15,290
Congratulations dude

2300
01:51:15,290 --> 01:51:16,410
What a life you have!

2301
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:18,950
You loved a girl in school,

2302
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:20,500
And one in college

2303
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,040
And got married to some one else

2304
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:23,580
And you are going to be dad

2305
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:25,000
Look at my life...

2306
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:25,700
What's wrong with yours?

2307
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:27,500
Ahh..I was just kidding!

2308
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,540
You spoilt my school love...

2309
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:32,200
And you spoilt college love...

2310
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:35,330
You both are the reason for my life's twists and turns.

2311
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:35,910
Hello...

2312
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:38,200
Didn't we find a nice girl for you to get married?

2313
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:41,450
That the only, reason i am treating you guys today!

2314
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:42,910
Come Nidhima

2315
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:44,910
Or else i would have..

2316
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:46,250
Why? what happened?

2317
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:56,290
Hmm..

2318
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:57,540
Ahh... yes

2319
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,700
Haven't you stopped saying 'yes' 'yes' 'no' 'no' yet?

2320
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:00,750
What?

2321
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,870
You have learnt a new word "what"!!

2322
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:06,160
Do you remember how you were roaming behind me?

2323
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,000
Was i?

2324
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,580
Hmm..

2325
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:08,450
Behind you?

2326
01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:09,250
Hmm..

2327
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,950
I am married,

2328
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:13,330
she is my wife.

2329
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:14,370
Hi.. hi..

2330
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:15,910
You are so cute...

2331
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:17,540
Why did you marry him?

2332
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:20,540
I only rejected when he was behind me!

2333
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:22,500
Excuse me,

2334
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:26,200
You have mistaken him as someone else

2335
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,250
Sushma?

2336
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:28,290
Vijay?

2337
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:29,790
You both are here.

2338
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:31,540
Sushma

2339
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:34,580
Do you remember, how you used to scold him?

2340
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,830
So stupid!

2341
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:37,000
Your husband...

2342
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,910
Told Vijay, he would commit suicide if i say no to his love.

2343
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:41,660
Ahh?

2344
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:43,000
Right Vijay?

2345
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,700
Then.. she must be..

2346
01:52:46,330 --> 01:52:47,660
Reema?

2347
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:49,160
Finally!!!

2348
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,660
You recognised me

2349
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:53,450
I have changed a lot right?

2350
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:55,540
Ahh??

2351
01:52:57,330 --> 01:52:58,290
Yes..!!

2352
01:52:58,290 --> 01:53:01,120
Aadi keeps talking about you...

2353
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:02,330
Reema was like that...

2354
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:03,500
Reema was like this...

2355
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,540
Really?

2356
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:06,500
Is he still not over me?

2357
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,580
When did i always speak about her?

2358
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,450
I only told about her once,

2359
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,000
Ahh.. you know what?

2360
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:14,200
When he came to propose me,

2361
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:15,790
it's a long story!

2362
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:17,500
Reema, is it required now?

2363
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:18,450
why all that now?

2364
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:19,160
Aadi...

2365
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:20,870
Atleast ask her to sit

2366
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:22,120
she is insulting me while standing itself...

2367
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:24,330
Should i make her sit and get more insulted?

2368
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:25,870
I have to leave now,

2369
01:53:25,870 --> 01:53:27,830
It was great meeting you guys.

2370
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:30,500
I will tell you the full story, next when we meet.

2371
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,120
You all take care..

2372
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,540
Silly fellow!!

2373
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:35,790
Bye..

2374
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:37,080
Bye..

2375
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:56,870
She was like a flower...

2376
01:53:57,950 --> 01:53:59,870
Now she has turned into Cauliflower!

2377
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:03,120
I had told you then,

2378
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:05,200
she doesn't look like Titanic heroine

2379
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,700
You never listened to me.

2380
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:07,620
Hey!!!

2381
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:09,080
You were calling her Ash!!

2382
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,040
Look at her face properly.

2383
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:20,700
I was happy that i got promotion,

2384
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:22,660
And also i was going to be a father!

2385
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,040
Life was perfect!

2386
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:24,700
But

2387
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,830
This work, career all these things

2388
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:30,410
Just took me far away from myself...

2389
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:33,290
Hello.

2390
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:35,000
why no calls?

2391
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,200
I will call you back.

2392
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,700
Okie.

2393
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:40,950
I told Nidhi to quit her job to take rest.

2394
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:44,250
But it made her restless.

2395
01:55:00,330 --> 01:55:01,250
Hi!!

2396
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,080
What happened to my Nidhi?

2397
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:07,660
Why did my bird get into the nest?

2398
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:09,540
You shouldn't get upset for everything.

2399
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:10,540
Nidhi...

2400
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:11,660
Come here.

2401
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,370
Nidhima did you come?

2402
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:18,370
If you love me...

2403
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:20,370
you will be here before i count 3.

2404
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,250
3

2405
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:24,750
2

2406
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,040
1

2407
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:28,660
Forget it,

2408
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:30,250
If you don't love me...

2409
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:33,000
What will i do with this panipuri?

2410
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,080
I will put it in dust bin!

2411
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:39,870
She is like a maruthi car...

2412
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,290
Maintenance free

2413
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:44,160
It's tough to convince wife even with a diamond necklace...

2414
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:48,290
But i would get the work done, with just 25Rs panipuri!

2415
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:51,080
I am lucky to get a wife like her!

2416
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,040
You always say, you are bored at home.

2417
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:56,500
Shall i open a panipuri shop for you?

2418
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:57,910
Hmm super idea!!!

2419
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:59,000
You too quit your job...

2420
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,080
You keep making it for me,

2421
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,080
And i will keep eating it.

2422
01:56:06,450 --> 01:56:08,580
I somehow convinced her that day.

2423
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:11,450
And i decided not to repeat it next time

2424
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:12,410
But

2425
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:13,870
Nothing worked...

2426
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:16,950
Aadi...

2427
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:19,620
Manager is calling you.

2428
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:20,580
Ya i will come.

2429
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,660
I just forgot what's important

2430
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:46,750
and what i should prioritise

2431
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:01,410
Oh, 20 missed calls!!

2432
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,200
Nidhima...

2433
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:00,790
What happened?

2434
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,120
Did anyone say anything to you?

2435
01:58:03,370 --> 01:58:05,450
Who is here to say anything?

2436
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:09,120
I had too much of work in office.

2437
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:12,620
Before we were just 2 of us...

2438
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:14,620
Now we are going to be 3...

2439
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:16,950
To own a house,

2440
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,290
A car...

2441
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:20,040
And a good lifestyle

2442
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:21,200
I have to work right?

2443
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,580
If you work you will get money

2444
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:25,910
But your presence is not here

2445
01:58:27,290 --> 01:58:28,500
If you are not here...

2446
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,290
What will i do with the money?

2447
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,620
I don't want...

2448
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,120
The money you earn...

2449
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:36,200
I want the time you give me

2450
01:58:42,450 --> 01:58:44,910
I don't know if we will be there tomorrow,

2451
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:47,200
But i want you to be with me for today,

2452
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:48,660
Will you be there?

2453
01:58:58,830 --> 01:59:00,410
I am hungry

2454
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:09,870
I always treated Nidhi like a kid,

2455
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:11,660
But what she told...

2456
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:12,950
Was so true.

2457
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:18,080
I thought, whatever i was doing was for our future,

2458
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:20,830
But she made me realise...

2459
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:22,910
That i wasn't there in it

2460
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,160
To keep our loved one's happy.

2461
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:27,660
We work hard

2462
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,580
But the real happiness lies in...

2463
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:31,790
In those wonderful moments we spend.

2464
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:43,700
Why are you taking such decision Mr Aditya?

2465
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:45,790
Think about it...

2466
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,500
Who will say no to promotion?

2467
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,120
This is for your future.

2468
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:51,080
I have taken this decision for my future,

2469
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:13,500
Just a minute,

2470
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:14,830
Hello

2471
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:15,660
Hi Sushma,

2472
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:16,870
Where are you guys?

2473
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:19,000
I have come out with Vijay,

2474
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:21,040
I am all ready,

2475
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,250
What's the surprise?

2476
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:24,290
Surprise?

2477
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:26,540
Oh tomorrow is your birthday right?

2478
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:27,040
Hmm..

2479
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,790
Aadi didn't tell me anything...

2480
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:29,830
Where is he now?

2481
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:30,450
Is it?

2482
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:32,750
He might be in office,

2483
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:34,290
Everyday he is late,

2484
02:00:34,290 --> 02:00:36,830
He might come by 12 and surprise me!

2485
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:39,910
Be on line..

2486
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:44,290
Hi..

2487
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:45,660

2488
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:46,790
Ahh??

2489
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:48,080
Why did you come so early?

2490
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:49,410
Are you mad?

2491
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:51,080
If i come early, you have a problem?

2492
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:52,410
If i come late also you have problem

2493
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:54,290
Wait, i am hungry

2494
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:55,080
I will freshen up...

2495
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:58,790
Hey he might take me out for dinner,

2496
02:00:58,790 --> 02:01:00,080

2497
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:00,910
I will call you later.

2498
02:01:00,910 --> 02:01:01,950
Ahh okie...

2499
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:02,620
Ahh okie.. enjoy.

2500
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:04,080
Okie bye.

2501
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:13,330
Are you going somewhere?

2502
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:14,330
You said you were hungry,

2503
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:15,200
So, for dinner

2504
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:17,540
You want to eat out everyday?

2505
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:19,080
What about your health?

2506
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:20,250
Come let's eat here only.

2507
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:36,370
Why? what happened?

2508
02:01:36,370 --> 02:01:37,330
Nothing

2509
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:39,120
You want me to feed you?

2510
02:01:39,910 --> 02:01:41,040
I will eat myself.

2511
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,000
Ok eat.

2512
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,450
Hello, where are you guys?

2513
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:22,870
Full on party?

2514
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:23,950
We are at home.

2515
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:25,080
At home?

2516
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:26,370
You cut the cake?

2517
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:27,830
What is the surprise?

2518
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:29,830
No cakes.. no surprises..

2519
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:30,910
Why?

2520
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:32,000
Where is he?

2521
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,370
He is sleeping here.

2522
02:02:33,370 --> 02:02:34,500
Is he sleeping?

2523
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,250
Wait i will call him now.

2524
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:37,910
Leave it, he is sleeping.

2525
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:39,450
Bye...

2526
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:47,870
Sorry...

2527
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:49,790
I forgot to wish you

2528
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:51,080
Happy birthday

2529
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,120
Thanks...!

2530
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:56,160
Ahh!!!

2531
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:12,950
Happy birthday!!

2532
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:17,080
Why no sound at all?

2533
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:19,500
You must be far away from us?

2534
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:21,910
Yes, we are in hell.

2535
02:03:21,910 --> 02:03:22,950
What?

2536
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:26,830
Thanks Vijay!!

2537
02:03:27,910 --> 02:03:31,660
Thanks for remembering and wishing me on my birthday

2538
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:35,120
Why are you shouting?

2539
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:36,080
I can hear you...

2540
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,370
Hello...

2541
02:03:38,910 --> 02:03:39,580
Hello...

2542
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:42,500
Such crazy people!

2543
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:58,450
Why sweetheart?

2544
02:03:58,910 --> 02:03:59,790
What?

2545
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:00,870
Sweetheart?

2546
02:04:00,870 --> 02:04:02,410
Who is your sweetheart?

2547
02:04:02,410 --> 02:04:05,370
Everyone is wishing me for my birthday,

2548
02:04:05,370 --> 02:04:07,040
What's wrong with you?

2549
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,830
Oh, it's your birthday...

2550
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:12,950
I am roaming around you, wearing new dress...

2551
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:14,290
Can't you see?

2552
02:04:14,450 --> 02:04:17,000
Sorry.. Sorry..Sorry.. Sorry..Sorry..

2553
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,450
Sorry sweetheart...

2554
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:19,330
Happy birthday...

2555
02:04:19,330 --> 02:04:20,500
Leave my hand.

2556
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:22,750
Didn't i surprise you in the mid night...

2557
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:23,700
On your birthday?

2558
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:24,500
Hmm..

2559
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,160
You enjoyed so much then...

2560
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:27,370
Why can't you surprise me?

2561
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:30,450
What can i surprise you at this time?

2562
02:04:30,450 --> 02:04:31,750
It was during this time...

2563
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:33,040
You went to surprise her,

2564
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,370
And sat the whole night in Mysore footpath!

2565
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Ohh...

2566
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,870
Did you lose interest after marriage?

2567
02:04:38,870 --> 02:04:40,450
All you men are the same!

2568
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,700
It's not like that Nidhima...

2569
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:42,830
Hey get lost..

2570
02:04:42,830 --> 02:04:43,500
Ahh?

2571
02:04:45,410 --> 02:04:46,370
Get lost?

2572
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:09,250
Are you crying?

2573
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:10,500
Sorry

2574
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:11,750
I kicked you.

2575
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:14,550
Wow you are so romantic!

2576
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:16,380
You both make a very good pair.

2577
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,670
After seeing you both

2578
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:21,170
I too want to get married soon!

2579
02:07:21,170 --> 02:07:22,000
Actually.

2580
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,880
I have started liking Nidhi now

2581
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:25,670
I want to meet her once.

2582
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:27,500
Which baby did you have?

2583
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,920
Is it a boy or a girl?

2584
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,250
Can i guess this one?

2585
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:31,170
Please?

2586
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:33,590
Aadi?

2587
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:36,750
Aadi?

2588
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:43,090
Why did you become silent?

2589
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,340
Are you her husband?

2590
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:18,380
Yes,

2591
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:19,500
What happened?

2592
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,590
It's a miscarriage.

2593
02:08:20,670 --> 02:08:21,210
Ahh?

2594
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:23,710
How is she?

2595
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:24,750
She is fine,

2596
02:08:24,750 --> 02:08:25,840
You can go and see her.

2597
02:08:27,550 --> 02:08:28,500
Nidhima...

2598
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:33,880
Sorry...

2599
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:35,460
Why are you asking me sorry?

2600
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:36,750
You shouldn't cry.

2601
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:37,750
Sir,

2602
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:39,550
Doctor is calling you.

2603
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:41,340
I will speak to the doctor and come,

2604
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:42,420
You rest.

2605
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:53,130
How are you related to the patient?

2606
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:54,800
I am her husband

2607
02:08:55,590 --> 02:08:56,340
Why? What happened?

2608
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:57,090
Any problem?

2609
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:59,050
We got blood sample reports,

2610
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:01,590
HCG levels are very high.

2611
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:05,090
If it's too high,

2612
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:07,340
Then there might be presence of malignant cells.

2613
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:10,050
Any serious issues?

2614
02:09:11,050 --> 02:09:13,050
I can't confirm you right now.

2615
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:15,380
You do one thing,

2616
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:16,920
Get PET scan

2617
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,550
And these tests done.

2618
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:20,340
Once i get the reports,

2619
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:21,920
I will tell your wife's exact condition.

2620
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:59,250
Doctor, what has happened to me?

2621
02:10:00,050 --> 02:10:02,210
The reason for your miscarriage is..

2622
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:04,590
You have ovarian cancer!

2623
02:10:05,590 --> 02:10:06,960
It's in stage 3

2624
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:08,340
Cancer?

2625
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:10,300
It's just not possible...

2626
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:12,750
Something must be wrong with the report.

2627
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:14,250
How can she have cancer?

2628
02:10:14,250 --> 02:10:15,500
See her, she is so healthy.

2629
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:21,960
So what if she has got cancer?

2630
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:23,500
It's so common these days.

2631
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:25,250
It can be cured right?

2632
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:27,250
Nothing to worry,

2633
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:28,800
If it's in stage 1,2 and 3

2634
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,050
It can be cured.

2635
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:31,210
There are treatments...

2636
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:34,210
Let's start treating from today.

2637
02:10:34,210 --> 02:10:35,500
Yes of course,

2638
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:39,300
We have to do chemotherapy and radiation therapy

2639
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:41,460
For which, you have to be mentally strong.

2640
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:44,250
She is very strong doctor,

2641
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:46,880
Infact we both will fight together.

2642
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:48,090
Very good,

2643
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:49,710
Don't worry, i will be there with you.

2644
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:02,460
Nidhima...

2645
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:05,000
Nidhi?

2646
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:07,880
Nidhima...

2647
02:14:08,630 --> 02:14:09,590
Nidhima...

2648
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:10,920
What happened?

2649
02:14:13,710 --> 02:14:15,000
Doctor has already told us

2650
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:16,800
There will be hair loss.

2651
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:20,840
I love my hair.

2652
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:24,380
Why is it happening to me?

2653
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:25,840
Will i be fine again?

2654
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:27,550
100 percent you will be fine...

2655
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:31,920
Still, i won't look nice without my hair

2656
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:32,840
Who told you?

2657
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:34,550
My Nidhima is pretty however she is.

2658
02:14:34,550 --> 02:14:36,380
I don't look good even with my hair,

2659
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:37,710
No,

2660
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:39,130
You are look good.

2661
02:16:48,050 --> 02:16:50,550
Cancer cells have spread to other organs.

2662
02:16:50,550 --> 02:16:51,880
It's in the last stage.

2663
02:16:52,130 --> 02:16:53,300
Sorry to say this,

2664
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:56,090
No further treatment will help.

2665
02:16:57,050 --> 02:17:00,710
We can give pain killers to reduce the pain.

2666
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:03,550
Can we somehow...

2667
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:05,250
Save her?

2668
02:17:59,550 --> 02:18:00,920
What are you doing?

2669
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:02,670
Doctor just told me,

2670
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:04,960
She will be fine in a week.

2671
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:06,460
Sushma,

2672
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:08,000
You take a week off.

2673
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,380
We all will go on a trip.

2674
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:10,050
Viju,

2675
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:11,210
Select a good place to go.

2676
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:14,750
Nidhima come...

2677
02:18:15,710 --> 02:18:17,090
You know what,

2678
02:18:18,630 --> 02:18:20,550
Doctor couldn't believe

2679
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:22,340
That you are recovering so fast.

2680
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:27,050
You are the only patient to recover so soon.

2681
02:18:33,630 --> 02:18:34,880
To whom should all this credit go to?

2682
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,090
I have taken care of her like a princess.

2683
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:52,000
Nidhima...

2684
02:18:52,300 --> 02:18:53,250
You want some water?

2685
02:18:57,300 --> 02:18:57,920
Hey...

2686
02:18:58,250 --> 02:18:59,630
What are you guys doing here?

2687
02:18:59,630 --> 02:19:02,170
Aren't you late to office? leave now

2688
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:03,800
We will meet tomorrow, come.

2689
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:05,750
Don't forget to book the tickets.

2690
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:12,670
Aadi..

2691
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:13,800
Hmm?

2692
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:21,340
I know, i won't live long,

2693
02:19:23,170 --> 02:19:24,380
Who told you?

2694
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:27,550
It's written on your face.

2695
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,340
What's written?

2696
02:19:30,130 --> 02:19:31,920
You are feeling comfortable right?

2697
02:19:33,210 --> 02:19:35,590
Those medicines are keeping me comfortable.

2698
02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:38,750
It's just temporary.

2699
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:41,170
I am sorry Aadi.

2700
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,710
Why are you asking me sorry?

2701
02:19:44,590 --> 02:19:47,090
I dreamt of having kids, grandchildren,

2702
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:51,670
And that we grow old together.

2703
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:57,050
And now i am leaving you halfway

2704
02:19:58,590 --> 02:20:00,460
How much time is left?

2705
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:04,380
If i look at you,

2706
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:06,380
I don't think i have much time.

2707
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:09,300
Can you fulfill my word?

2708
02:20:12,710 --> 02:20:14,090
Just sleep for a while.

2709
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:17,880
Can you take me home, please?

2710
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:22,170
You wanted to meet Nidhi right?

2711
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:23,500
Here she is...

2712
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,630
Hi Nidhima...

2713
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:27,670
Look who is here.

2714
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:34,050
How are you?

2715
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:40,090
I have brought your Xerox.

2716
02:21:40,090 --> 02:21:41,500
Even she is like you...

2717
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:43,050
Talks very less...

2718
02:21:43,710 --> 02:21:44,630
Say hi.

2719
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:50,960
She can't hear you...

2720
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:52,090
Open your mouth and say.

2721
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:54,550
Hi...

2722
02:21:59,250 --> 02:22:00,750
What are looking at?

2723
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:02,590
Why don't i have tears in my eyes?

2724
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:05,130
She was the one who taught me

2725
02:22:05,130 --> 02:22:06,550
what true love and happiness is.

2726
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:08,130
If i cry infront of her,

2727
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:09,380
she won't like it.

2728
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:10,920
Look,

2729
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:12,420
She left me alone

2730
02:22:12,630 --> 02:22:13,750
And happily settled there.

2731
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:34,300
Aadi..

2732
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:35,460
Hmm?

2733
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:37,000
My nature,

2734
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
My hairstyle

2735
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,630
Everything is similar to Nidhi right?

2736
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:42,460
Hmm..

2737
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:45,050
That's why you saved me,

2738
02:22:45,050 --> 02:22:45,960
You dropped me,

2739
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:48,050
And spoke so much with me...

2740
02:22:48,340 --> 02:22:49,090
Hmm.

2741
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:53,050
Life is still a long journey...

2742
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:55,500
Can you again...

2743
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:57,590
Love someone?

2744
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:00,630
Everytime i was in love,

2745
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:02,800
i felt, it was true love.

2746
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,750
When everytime it failed,

2747
02:23:04,750 --> 02:23:06,750
I looked for a new love.

2748
02:23:07,170 --> 02:23:08,920
Nidhi might not be there with me,

2749
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:12,840
But i never felt, her love is dead or a failure.

2750
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:16,300
Because true love happens only once in a life time,

2751
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:18,300
And it already happened to me

2752
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:19,920
That's enough for this life time.

2753
02:23:36,050 --> 02:23:38,420
It was nice meeting you Aadi.

2754
02:23:39,170 --> 02:23:39,920
Bye..

2755
02:23:45,420 --> 02:23:46,050
Aadi..

2756
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:46,710
Hmm..

2757
02:23:47,130 --> 02:23:48,800
This was my best journey.

2758
02:23:49,550 --> 02:23:50,960
Your friends were right

2759
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:53,250
Time just flies, if you are along

2760
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:54,000
Bye..
