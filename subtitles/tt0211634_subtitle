1
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:51,463
The accident last month of the
truck carrying arms to the border.

2
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:55,500
And the fire in the jeep.
The task of their inquiry...

3
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,299
l've prepared its' report.

4
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:02,171
- And?
- lt was a plan not an accident.

5
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,644
The aim being stealing of arms.

6
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:10,578
Meaning our people are involved.
Must hand the case to intelligence.

7
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:15,015
l have a request. The truck
that is to leave tomorrow..

8
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:18,892
Give me the responsibility of taking
it to the border security force.

9
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:24,229
lf this happens again, the arms
looters will be uncontrollable.

10
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,474
Why doesn't this plane fly?

11
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:34,473
What are you saying, son?
Do toys ever fly?

12
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:36,646
Buy me a flying plane.

13
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:40,417
First grow up. Then you'll see...

14
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:44,480
You'll have more planes
than people have cars.

15
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:47,389
For the time being,
make do with this.

16
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:53,359
lf you fill A, B, C... in
his mind instead of this...

17
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,167
He'd learn to write his name.

18
00:03:56,835 --> 00:04:00,566
He will learn. The alphabets
are not leaving lndia.

19
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:02,863
But his age is flying past.

20
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:07,401
He's grown so big. You neither showed
him a book, nor did he see a school.

21
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,277
Aren't you at all worried?

22
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:14,949
Buy a couple of buffaloes with
the money you'll spend on books.

23
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,583
The boy will drink milk
and become as tough as us!

24
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,515
He'll become as clever as
brother. You won't believe it.

25
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:33,096
- What is it? - Sir has
called for an urgent meeting.

26
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:37,606
- What meeting? - The usual
but he has called everybody.

27
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:44,048
That's fine but what about the
cash for the arms we gave last time?

28
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,579
He's given this bag full!

29
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:52,515
- How much is it?
- l can't count much.

30
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:56,025
l'll weigh it if you say.
Must be 7 or 8 kilos with the bag.

31
00:04:56,361 --> 00:05:02,596
No need. You wait at the
corner, l'll change and come.

32
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:15,176
Are you doing the duty for which
the government gave you this uniform?

33
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,777
Of course! That's what l'm doing!

34
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:19,276
You were but no more!

35
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:24,051
Earlier 3000 rupees came
on the first of every month.

36
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,947
Now millions come at any date!

37
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,957
l ask, why? What do we lack?

38
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,295
What an illiterate woman!
l want to live, enjoy!

39
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,266
By selling your country?

40
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:43,040
Do you want me to spend
all my life carrying a gun?

41
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,205
And die at the
enemy's hand someday?

42
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,469
You want to be a widow?

43
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,447
That widow is better than a woman..

44
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,741
Whose husband is a
martyr for the nation.

45
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:57,384
l can bear to see you
dying by a bullet.

46
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:01,390
But l can't bear the
stigma of a traitor on you!

47
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,720
l say for the last time..
Don't be loyal to me.

48
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:11,301
But if you're disloyal to your
country, l won't forgive you!

49
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,301
- Mother!
- Don't teach me!

50
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,874
l can leave my wife for money!

51
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,216
Subhedar Pratap Singh has come.

52
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,989
What's the matter? DK always
meets after delivery of arms.

53
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,758
What meeting is this beforehand?

54
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:55,369
l've called this meeting...

55
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:03,477
Because the truck of arms to go
to the border with you tomorrow..

56
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:08,523
You can't loot it easily.

57
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:15,589
- Why? - Because..
another in charge is coming.

58
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,762
How did you find out?

59
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,904
From our fourth partner,
Jaswant Dalal, Major's driver.

60
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,807
He is a very strict man.

61
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,646
With him around, forget trucks
we can't steal a nail!

62
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,816
Opportunity never strikes again.

63
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:45,593
The truck carries latest arms worth
10 crores that sell like hot cakes.

64
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:50,360
Each of us 4 partners
can earn 2.5 crores.

65
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:57,737
Come what may, we will
have those weapons.

66
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,796
The soldiers who play
with guns and cannons...

67
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,327
... do not fear
the police's revolver.

68
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,812
l came stealthily yet
you found me out.

69
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:18,112
We soldiers have 4 not 2 eyes.

70
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:22,490
- You...
- Hello.

71
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,054
Sudden trip?

72
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:31,430
l've come from Delhi to
give you some good news.

73
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:33,494
- What is that?
- Not now.

74
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,465
First some good piping hot
breakfast, then the news.

75
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:42,038
The good news is
l've been promoted.

76
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:46,174
l have to join duty
in Bombay in a week.

77
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,583
And to celebrate we're going
to Simla by the evening flight.

78
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:57,758
Here are the tickets.

79
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:07,801
We won't be able to go.

80
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:12,231
l'd promised Raju we'll go to
a hill station if he stands first.

81
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,903
Trucks with arms are
going to the border.

82
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:19,874
- l'm in charge of it.
- Hand it to somebody else.

83
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:23,276
lf it was given by an officer
l would have done this.

84
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:27,847
But l've asked for this assignment.

85
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,795
You've ruined my plan.

86
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,397
Doesn't matter. l'll go
to Bombay today itself.

87
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:38,728
- The jeep is ready sir.
- Wait for me.

88
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:05,960
Stop the jeep.

89
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,664
Reverse.

90
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,532
Why have you stopped the truck?

91
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,776
There's an oil leak.
So the wheel is jammed.

92
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,282
l'll try to contact headquarters.

93
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,568
What's wrong with the wireless?

94
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:52,703
Some soldiers will remain here
with you for security.

95
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,837
The rest will go with me.

96
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:57,845
l'll get help from
the nearby station.

97
00:11:58,749 --> 00:11:59,443
Any doubts?

98
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:54,903
Pile it in.

99
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:31,702
Bastards!

100
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:36,669
These weapons are not bought from
the gold in a king's treasury!

101
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:45,148
But by the sweat and blood
of 90 crore lndians!

102
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:50,053
You swore to protect the
country but you loot it!

103
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:55,591
lt's a shame for this uniform
to be draped on your body!

104
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,538
You'll get only some copper or
bronze medals by arresting us.

105
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:06,070
Become our partner.
We'll give you one half!

106
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,978
You want to buy me off!

107
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:20,515
Who can't be bought? Everybody
is for sale. At their own price.

108
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:22,623
What will we soldiers do in
this environment by being honest?

109
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:26,991
Our nation is safe
because of our honesty!

110
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:28,797
Or it would lose its' identity!

111
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,958
People don't sleep
because the sun sets.

112
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,963
lt's because we guard the border
that the country sleeps in peace!

113
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,639
lf we sell our honesty...

114
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:43,078
Another color will fly
in place of our tricolor!

115
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,319
A fax from lnterpol, Australia.

116
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,988
Send a message to
ACP Dinesh Kapoor.

117
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:41,891
For an urgent meeting.

118
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:06,872
This is Jaswant Dalal. We've
got a message from Australia.

119
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,778
He deals in illegal arms smuggling.

120
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:13,256
He's coming to Bombay
by a cargo ship today.

121
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:20,926
lf we arrest him, we can find out
about illegal arms smuggling here.

122
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:26,993
l've called for a secret meeting
so nobody outside hears about it.

123
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:32,108
Otherwise people attached to him,
who'll suffer by his arrest...

124
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,909
...will have him killed.

125
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,808
You'll be in charge of the
operation to nab Jaswant.

126
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:45,013
And l want him alive
under any circumstance!

127
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,404
- Got the fax?
- Yes.

128
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,034
The police want him alive.

129
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,237
You know what you have to do.

130
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:50,245
Remember he must not get into
the police's hands alive.

131
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:55,516
- l cannot help you in this.
- All right.

132
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:12,232
He can't escape. There are more
policemen than workers here.

133
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,992
Jaswant has come.
Shall we begin movement?

134
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,841
Who are you? What do you want?

135
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,647
- To save your life.
- Whom do l fear?

136
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,348
Whom every criminal fears.

137
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:04,558
The ones outside are
the police not workers.

138
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:12,934
The police can be recognized
by their shoes not clothes.

139
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:20,167
lf you want to get out of here...

140
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,972
Do as l say.

141
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:31,551
Jaswant is not to be seen.

142
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:39,060
Nobody here.

143
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:00,480
Jaswant is in the container
that is being off loaded!

144
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:02,583
There's another man with him!

145
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:06,616
Should we surround the container?

146
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:14,453
Surround the container
being off loaded.

147
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,135
- Stop the container!
- Stop the container!

148
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:38,812
Bring the container down.

149
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:44,717
Nobody will fire.
We want him alive.

150
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:11,447
So far l did what you said.

151
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:14,913
Now you'll do what l say.

152
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:16,280
Stop the car.

153
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:42,505
Hands up.

154
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:56,625
You're a useful man but
my principle is...

155
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:00,225
Job finished, man finished.

156
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:28,584
And my principle is
man finished, job finished.

157
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,194
l want the killer not your sorry!

158
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:35,955
Seal all the ways of going out.

159
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:41,395
And remember he must
not leave this city!

160
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:23,176
- Are you an lndian?
- You know me?

161
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,375
- No.
- No?

162
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:29,709
- Now?
- No.

163
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:35,884
No, l don't recognize you.

164
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:48,836
- Why are you crying?
- lt's a sad story.

165
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,065
Once there was a fair of Kumbh.

166
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,104
- ln Australia?
- No, lndia.

167
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,338
l have a twin called
Sohan. l'm Mohan.

168
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:01,849
- He was left and l right and
in the center was... - Your mom.

169
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:07,179
My father. We were happily
going when all of a sudden..

170
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,322
- He ran.
- Who, your Dad?

171
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:14,896
No, a thief. l screamed, Dad!
He's running away with the bag!

172
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,032
- He ran after him.
- Who, your Dad?

173
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,894
My brother was behind the thief.

174
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:24,569
They were running and l screamed
and he fell with a thud!

175
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,365
- Thief?
- My Dad!

176
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,379
He was drunk and the
police caught him

177
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:32,013
- The thief?
- My Dad!

178
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:34,977
- And started beating him.
- But why?

179
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:38,420
They thought he was the thief.
in the meantime he ran away!

180
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:39,984
- The thief?
- My brother!

181
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:42,749
Since then l'm looking for him.

182
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:44,789
- The thief?
- No! My brother!

183
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,830
But if he was lost in lndia
why are you looking for him here?

184
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:51,296
That was different. He ran away.

185
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:57,606
He had two hobbies, to see
kangaroos and pick pockets.

186
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:01,074
Tell me, is any place better
than trams to pick pockets?

187
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:03,445
That's why l took this job.

188
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:07,943
Someday he'll come here to
pick pocket and l'll see him.

189
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:12,478
- lt's come! - Your brother?
- No, your station!

190
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:22,630
lf you ever see that rascal
whom l'm looking for..

191
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:25,958
- Give him my card.
- Whom? The thief?

192
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:28,834
To my brother, Sohan!

193
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:31,371
Turned my head round!

194
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:12,482
Who will be Miss Valentine
in today's function at the club?

195
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:13,585
Me.

196
00:33:15,158 --> 00:33:16,182
Why are you laughing?

197
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:24,964
This was my new car!

198
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:32,272
You damaged my car!

199
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:37,006
Why do you drive abroad
when you don't know driving!

200
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:39,276
Why don't you drive bullock
carts in your own country?

201
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:43,177
These days lndians pilot planes,
jet rockets and space shuttles!

202
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,613
You braked and the car stopped.
l braked and my car didn't.

203
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:50,251
- lt's a little thing.
- Little thing?

204
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:53,951
So it may be big. But not so big
that Vicky can't compensate for it!

205
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:58,693
How much? 50, 100, 300?

206
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:02,600
You'll remember you
met a wealthy lndian!

207
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:08,236
How dare you touch me!

208
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,781
Dress like a modern girl
and talk like an old woman!

209
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,892
Madam this is Australia not lndia
You can't stop and talk midway...

210
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:28,729
Go and talk of love in a garden
Sing, dance, makes no difference.

211
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:34,330
We're not talking of love.
He crashed into my car.

212
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:38,734
Both of you will have to
come to the police station.

213
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,772
Why are you wasting time?

214
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:45,771
We take back our complaint.

215
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:50,745
This is understanding.
You lose some to gain some.

216
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:55,920
When and where?

217
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,105
- You?
- Yes, me.

218
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:11,662
You have a twin?

219
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:15,841
Who was lost in the fair?

220
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:19,805
- l saw him. - Where?
- He's a tram conductor.

221
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:24,717
That is me.

222
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:29,983
You're talking of Sohan.
l thought...

223
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:36,125
He must have graduated
from picking pockets.

224
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,163
And he'll steal somebody's car
and break the signal to escape.

225
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:41,934
And l'll catch him.

226
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,539
So l became a traffic policeman.

227
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:48,176
Why did you make fairs, Lord?

228
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:07,227
A day for lovers.

229
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:14,602
You all know, we in lndia Club
choose a Miss and Mr. Valentine.

230
00:36:15,171 --> 00:36:16,968
And this years'
Miss Valentine is...

231
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:34,546
Friends, amongst you whoever
answers 3 of Preeti's questions..

232
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:37,250
He will be chosen Mister Valentine!

233
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:42,131
He gets an opportunity to dance...

234
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:45,524
And kiss Miss Valentine's hand!

235
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:53,737
She sets one small condition.

236
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:57,139
lf you can't answer her questions..

237
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:02,582
You'll have her pretty
sandal not her hands to kiss!

238
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:09,791
What's the matter? Can none
among you answer her questions?

239
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,282
l'll answer her.

240
00:37:19,736 --> 00:37:22,864
Think again. lf you lose
you'll have to kiss her shoe.

241
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:28,534
Don't worry. One who is
kissable from head to toe..

242
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:31,139
Her head and toe are the same.

243
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:34,014
Ask the question.

244
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:39,951
First question. What is
her favorite fruit?

245
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:43,087
The sweetest fruit is of labor.

246
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:46,918
But Miss Valentine is
miles away from hard work.

247
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:51,229
So her favorite fruit can't be
mango, sweet lime or orange.

248
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:54,863
Because you have to
peel it to eat it.

249
00:37:56,272 --> 00:38:00,265
Her favorite fruit is one that can
be popped in the mouth and swallowed.

250
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:02,441
That is grape.

251
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:16,988
Next question. What's
her favorite sport?

252
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,822
Man likes games
according to his nature.

253
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:24,662
And her nature...
fight, fight and fight!

254
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:28,897
So she likes WWF wrestling.

255
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:38,008
Tell him to answer simply.
Why is he beating round the bush?

256
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:41,075
So what? He's answering right!

257
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,052
Now the last question.

258
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:56,360
Which of the 7 wonders
is her favorite?

259
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:59,891
l'll have to answer this
in a roundabout manner.

260
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:01,160
Will do!

261
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:07,002
The wonder she likes is very
different from her nature.

262
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,044
She hates the word love.

263
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:14,174
But likes the wonder
that is a symbol of love.

264
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:22,620
This year's Mister
Valentine is Vicky!

265
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:28,723
She asked three ordinary questions.

266
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:33,927
lf she had to ask anything today
it should have been of heart and love.

267
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:35,966
l would even answer that.

268
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:39,368
What's in her heart.

269
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:46,245
The heart in you is lndian.

270
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:49,116
And lndian heart is not a loafer.

271
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:51,849
lt likes the whole world.

272
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:54,013
But belongs to an lndian.

273
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,056
All of you can participate
in today's Valentine Day.

274
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,690
You'll see, l won't leave him!

275
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:04,932
Don't ever leave him!
He's so handsome, intelligent.

276
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:08,659
Shut up! Just because
he answered my questions..

277
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,262
You think that fool is intelligent!

278
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:16,834
He's great. He even said
what l hadn't told him.

279
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:21,409
- You told him all this?
- Yes!

280
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:26,988
l won't spare you!

281
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:46,193
- Which is table 7?
- That one.

282
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,364
But don't sit there.

283
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:03,718
Here's your best drink.

284
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:10,020
- You?
- Yes.

285
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:11,988
- You have a twin?
- Yes.

286
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:16,454
- He's searching for you all over.
- Where is he?

287
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:18,460
He's become a traffic policeman.

288
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:23,031
- That was me.
- You were in the police.

289
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:28,366
l tried that job too but
Mohan didn't meet Sohan.

290
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:32,512
So l became a waiter.
He loved one thing...

291
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:35,909
Of seeing dances. And English
dances are shown here.

292
00:47:36,685 --> 00:47:40,348
So l joined here. Someday
he will come here, l think.

293
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,855
Please don't sit at this table.

294
00:47:46,895 --> 00:47:48,021
Please sit at any other table.

295
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:53,999
He's come here! Did you
tell him we're coming here?

296
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:57,203
l swear this time l didn't tell him.

297
00:47:58,006 --> 00:48:00,873
You can't sit here because
this is Jojo's table.

298
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:06,211
- Who is he? - The son of
the most dangerous man here.

299
00:48:08,283 --> 00:48:09,580
He always keeps smiling.

300
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:14,221
- Something like this.
- lt's good for health.

301
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:20,456
l know that but when he stops
laughing other's health suffers.

302
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:25,357
When somebody else sits on
his table, he stops laughing.

303
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,465
So what happens?

304
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:32,572
This. Their only fault
was sitting at this table.

305
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:37,002
Geigy saw it and thrashed them.

306
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,711
No better chance to get him beaten.

307
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:44,583
Hope nothing goes wrong.

308
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:48,388
- lf l get him beaten?
- Bet 100 bucks!

309
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:53,728
l don't want a nice man like
yourself's picture be stuck here.

310
00:48:54,096 --> 00:48:56,963
Get up my Pop!
Or he'll throw you out.

311
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:05,573
Great!
Did the sun rise in the west?

312
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:10,407
- Sure, sit.
- No!

313
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:15,882
Don't join on this table
or your joints will be disjointed.

314
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:18,213
Please join at another table.

315
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:24,624
What's going on? Don't you
know how to talk to customers?

316
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:30,790
- That's Jojo's table.
- So what?

317
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:34,067
Why are you standing here? lt's
time for Jojo. Get his order.

318
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:42,742
l'm the hotel manager.
Please get up from here.

319
00:49:43,245 --> 00:49:48,239
- This table is reserved.
- You should have kept the plate.

320
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:51,216
You don't know.
Jojo is very dangerous!

321
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,382
What do you think?
Vicky is double dangerous!

322
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:00,151
- lsn't it?
- Yes, triple dangerous!

323
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,761
Now l won't move from here.

324
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:05,324
Whether Jojo comes or bow wow!

325
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,104
Please be seated.

326
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:51,100
l think she didn't like your face.

327
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:57,100
l've trapped him so that
he goes straight to the hospital!

328
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:53,259
Swallowed the cap?
Are you so hungry?

329
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:41,914
l am finished!

330
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:49,881
Let go of me!

331
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,324
l went to the loo and
you showed your colors!

332
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:01,263
l know she wanted to
get me into trouble

333
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,335
But that doesn't mean you carry
her off as if she belongs to you!

334
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:41,365
The damage they have
suffered because of you..

335
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:43,026
Pay for it.

336
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,325
Now onwards when you laugh
people will laugh at you.

337
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:22,137
l got the money for the damages.

338
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:26,203
But in return Jojo's Dad
will damage you a lot.

339
00:56:28,149 --> 00:56:29,241
That's what l want.

340
00:56:36,524 --> 00:56:37,388
Let's go meet him.

341
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:50,531
Does it hurt a lot?

342
00:56:53,675 --> 00:56:56,735
Here are 50 dollars for treatment.

343
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:05,051
These are days of inflation.
Doesn't matter. Keep 500.

344
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:07,482
Consult a good doctor.

345
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:14,124
l saved you from a gangster like
Jojo, risked my life for you!

346
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,828
l fought with his henchmen,
shed so much of my blood...

347
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:20,992
And you are insulting me
instead of thanking me!

348
00:57:21,703 --> 00:57:25,332
Deeds of a loafer and
talks like a soldier!

349
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:31,303
Look in the mirror!
Soldier! Let's go.

350
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:37,015
Don't forget to wipe the sauce.

351
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,952
Very sour.

352
00:57:55,036 --> 00:58:01,703
- Who? - The one who knows
everything in your heart.

353
00:58:02,143 --> 00:58:04,134
How dare you call me!

354
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:08,641
With great difficulty l've
mustered courage for my finger.

355
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,645
So they could dial your number.

356
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:13,253
Don't disconnect without talking.

357
00:58:14,723 --> 00:58:18,921
- What is it?
- l'm going away to lndia.

358
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:21,194
l want to meet you one last time.

359
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:24,588
- You're going back forever?
- Yes.

360
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,331
So you want to meet me
for the last time?

361
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:32,965
All right. Come over.

362
00:58:36,778 --> 00:58:39,713
- What the blazes is this?
- Time is limited.

363
00:58:40,115 --> 00:58:45,576
- Why do you want to meet me?
- Card.

364
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:50,083
- l'm getting married.
- Which poor girl is jacked?

365
00:58:56,398 --> 00:58:57,626
Will you marry her?

366
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,196
l won't do anything.
She'll do all that has to be done.

367
00:59:02,037 --> 00:59:03,698
But how did you agree to marry her?

368
00:59:05,206 --> 00:59:06,901
What can l do? l'm helpless.

369
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:10,133
- What's the problem?
- Twist in story.

370
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:12,707
Shall l sit and tell you?

371
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:19,253
My father and her father
were friends

372
00:59:19,754 --> 00:59:22,222
And her grandfather and
mine too were friends.

373
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:25,593
And her grandfather made my
grandfather promise on deathbed...

374
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,056
They would marry us to continue
their friendship for 4 generations.

375
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:31,860
Tell me, what can l do?

376
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,426
l can't put off my Dad,
this marriage can't be put off!

377
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:36,931
This marriage is firm!

378
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:43,236
What can l do?

379
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:48,204
- Give me a present.
- What preset?

380
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:51,775
Give me one of your
sweet smiling evenings.

381
00:59:52,787 --> 00:59:57,588
Which will spread light in
the darkness of my life.

382
00:59:58,326 --> 01:00:00,260
Will you meet me?

383
01:00:07,368 --> 01:00:09,302
A drunken man never lies.

384
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:13,072
He can't lie.

385
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:18,537
Your car banged into
mine at the signal...

386
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:25,546
lt didn't crash.
l banged it on purpose.

387
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:28,488
Banged it on purpose?

388
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,952
What could l do?
Had to make friends with you.

389
01:00:32,894 --> 01:00:34,589
For that l had to meet you.

390
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:37,056
l needed an excuse for it.

391
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,558
And my tail light down.

392
01:00:42,737 --> 01:00:46,195
But this method of
friendship was wrong.

393
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:53,509
And the method of giving money?

394
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:55,506
Absolutely wrong!

395
01:00:57,285 --> 01:00:58,877
No experience ...

396
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:02,545
Then it's all right.

397
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:10,263
l'll tell you something.

398
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,666
l goaded you into fighting Jojo
at Little lndia Restaurant.

399
01:01:18,773 --> 01:01:20,240
Very bad.

400
01:01:21,676 --> 01:01:24,042
No experience...

401
01:01:30,685 --> 01:01:33,711
Did l say sorry for
troubling you so much?

402
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:38,456
- Did l say sorry?
- No.

403
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:42,095
Let's apologise to one another.

404
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:49,600
One minute. ln your country
that's not how you say sorry.

405
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:51,800
How else?

406
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:53,965
Like this.

407
01:01:57,278 --> 01:01:58,472
What are they doing?

408
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,746
Saying sorry to each other.

409
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:10,049
Good you told me.
l thought something else.

410
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,926
Let's say sorry to each other.

411
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:25,303
Wait.

412
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:29,235
When two people say
sorry to each other...

413
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:32,006
Why don't their noses clash?

414
01:02:33,948 --> 01:02:36,508
What a wrong time for the nose!

415
01:02:38,653 --> 01:02:40,985
You don't know? Doesn't mater.

416
01:02:41,823 --> 01:02:43,313
Let's ask somebody.

417
01:02:44,626 --> 01:02:45,854
Brother!

418
01:02:50,098 --> 01:02:51,531
Tell us something.

419
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:55,928
When a girl and a boy
say sorry to each other...

420
01:02:56,738 --> 01:02:58,569
Why don't their noses clash?

421
01:03:04,045 --> 01:03:05,478
Say something.

422
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:08,875
Sorry, l'm new to this place.

423
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:17,520
No problem.
We'll ask somebody clever

424
01:03:21,095 --> 01:03:21,993
Where do you want to go?

425
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:27,127
We're not going anywhere.
Just want to ask one thing.

426
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:31,168
- Ask as many questions.
- When a boy and a girl...

427
01:03:31,406 --> 01:03:33,704
...say sorry to each other,
why don't their noses clash?

428
01:03:50,091 --> 01:03:51,149
What are you thinking of?

429
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,556
We don't have all night.

430
01:03:53,995 --> 01:04:00,491
l'm not thinking of that. lt's
been 20 years since my marriage..

431
01:04:00,902 --> 01:04:03,234
l never said sorry to my wife.

432
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:06,136
How will l know why
the nose doesn't clash?

433
01:04:06,808 --> 01:04:11,472
Both of you say sorry
to each other and see.

434
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:14,410
You'll find out why
the nose doesn't clash.

435
01:04:15,283 --> 01:04:20,915
l'll go home and say sorry to the
wife to see where the nose clashes!

436
01:04:21,656 --> 01:04:23,123
And the car goes there!

437
01:04:26,094 --> 01:04:28,494
So clever.

438
01:04:29,564 --> 01:04:32,556
We'll say sorry and see.

439
01:04:37,105 --> 01:04:39,630
Wait! How can you say sorry to me?

440
01:04:40,241 --> 01:04:43,369
- Why? - Because
sorry is only said to...

441
01:04:43,878 --> 01:04:48,110
- The one you will marry.
- That's what l'm doing.

442
01:04:49,517 --> 01:04:51,542
See the card if you don't believe.

443
01:05:07,702 --> 01:05:08,396
Where is he?

444
01:05:14,642 --> 01:05:16,269
The one who has eyes only for you...

445
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:19,380
How can he marry another?

446
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:25,479
Yet if you don't accept my love,
tear this card and leave.

447
01:05:26,654 --> 01:05:28,519
l'll go away from you forever.

448
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:33,825
lf not, shut your eyes
and say in your heart...

449
01:05:34,595 --> 01:05:37,758
l'll appear again.

450
01:05:47,074 --> 01:05:50,339
And if not, shut your eyes
and say in your heart...

451
01:05:50,878 --> 01:05:53,472
l'll reappear.

452
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,977
Are you thinking what l am?

453
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:42,419
Let's go in and get married.

454
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,957
You'll have to talk
to my Papa for this.

455
01:12:47,361 --> 01:12:50,091
l'll talk to him. Where is he?

456
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:07,971
l want you to meet somebody.

457
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:14,982
- The young man who is with you.
- Strange. How did you know?

458
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:19,120
l even know what
clothes he's wearing.

459
01:13:20,261 --> 01:13:23,128
l keep track of you
like any good father.

460
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:27,292
Where you go, with whom
and who is meeting you.

461
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:29,968
But when are you coming?

462
01:13:38,779 --> 01:13:40,872
Come Pratap. How are you?

463
01:13:42,449 --> 01:13:45,111
Absolutely fit. And you?

464
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:49,020
l'm fit if my brother is fit.

465
01:13:50,691 --> 01:13:52,352
Why did you want to meet?

466
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:55,557
- Bad news.
- l know.

467
01:13:56,397 --> 01:13:59,662
You want to say Jaswant is dead.

468
01:14:00,467 --> 01:14:02,833
No, even worse.

469
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:07,030
l've got reports that
DK had him killed.

470
01:14:08,342 --> 01:14:10,674
Absolutely wrong.

471
01:14:11,645 --> 01:14:15,172
Sir can never kill his
partner of 25 years!

472
01:14:15,716 --> 01:14:17,843
He can do anything for money.

473
01:14:18,452 --> 01:14:20,784
Even if he did, it's good.

474
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:27,323
Had he escaped alive, the police
would've beaten everything out of him

475
01:14:27,795 --> 01:14:30,764
And handcuffed us and
taken us back to lndia!

476
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:34,460
Try to understand.

477
01:14:35,302 --> 01:14:37,770
Someday he might even
finish us off.

478
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,938
lf he kills us who will supply
him American arms in lndia?

479
01:14:44,411 --> 01:14:49,075
Listen to me. Right from beginning
his intentions were not true.

480
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:51,742
That's why he never
told us his address.

481
01:14:52,386 --> 01:14:55,981
He can contact us anytime
but we can never reach him.

482
01:14:56,824 --> 01:14:59,349
What do you want?
What should we do?

483
01:15:00,361 --> 01:15:04,457
Before he attacks us,
we should finish him!

484
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:09,959
The idea is not bad.

485
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:15,301
We were 4 partners.
Jaswant died and three remain.

486
01:15:16,443 --> 01:15:18,536
We kill DK and 2 remain.

487
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,176
You kill me and only you are left.

488
01:15:23,517 --> 01:15:26,008
Do you think l'm a village idiot?

489
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:28,814
You want to grab the
entire organization?

490
01:15:29,523 --> 01:15:32,720
l find your intentions
dishonorable not DK's.

491
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:34,651
- Shut up or...!
- Control yourself.

492
01:15:37,431 --> 01:15:40,366
You'll be finding your fingers
if they touch the trigger.

493
01:15:41,068 --> 01:15:45,971
l'm not Jaswant.
Firstly l won't die so easily.

494
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,843
Even if l do die, l won't become
a police file or news in paper.

495
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:57,378
lf you have a file on me,
l have a file of your deeds.

496
01:15:58,318 --> 01:16:02,015
That file will go to
the police soon as l die.

497
01:16:05,826 --> 01:16:09,227
What's the matter?
Changed tune seeing the gun?

498
01:16:10,564 --> 01:16:11,690
Laughing instead of crying.

499
01:16:14,268 --> 01:16:19,365
Hats off to you friend!
l talked of killing DK...

500
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:25,207
Because l wanted to know if you
had a hand in killing Jaswant.

501
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:28,372
lf you were responsible..

502
01:16:29,116 --> 01:16:31,949
You would agree with me.

503
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,354
So what have you decided?

504
01:16:36,723 --> 01:16:39,351
That you haven't changed.

505
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,790
You're still a friend of friends.
As you were 20 years ago.

506
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:45,424
Nobody can divide us 3 partners.

507
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:47,759
Except for death!

508
01:16:53,273 --> 01:16:56,538
Do you see that island?
Papa bought it for my last birthday.

509
01:16:57,611 --> 01:17:00,739
And that one? That was
for my first birthday.

510
01:17:02,082 --> 01:17:04,915
So your Papa buys you a new
island for every birthday?

511
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:07,080
Yes, in my name.

512
01:17:07,754 --> 01:17:09,221
Don't tell this to anybody else.

513
01:17:09,756 --> 01:17:12,156
- Why?
- lt will let out your age.

514
01:17:18,499 --> 01:17:21,127
Look there. That's my papa.

515
01:17:35,115 --> 01:17:35,706
This is...

516
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,785
You know his name
without my telling you?

517
01:17:40,387 --> 01:17:43,117
When he knows the color
of my clothes from miles away..

518
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:46,816
- He can know my name too.
- While giving a daughter...

519
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:49,858
Work is seen in addition to name.

520
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:52,791
Whatever he does, is great!

521
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:59,032
We'll see. You go in
We have business to talk.

522
01:18:10,884 --> 01:18:15,981
First tell me who gave you
the contract to kill Jaswant?

523
01:18:17,658 --> 01:18:19,592
So you know abut my work?

524
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:24,662
Anyway hear my principles too.

525
01:18:25,766 --> 01:18:29,258
l see the cash while accepting
a contract, not the payer.

526
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:35,575
You haven't seen the man who gave
you a contract to love my daughter?

527
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:41,845
l accept contracts for killing
not to play games of love!

528
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:44,816
Preeti's love and mine is no game.

529
01:18:45,285 --> 01:18:50,222
Maybe but a father won't
give his daughter to a man...

530
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,482
Whose hands are tainted with blood.

531
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,254
lf mine are tainted,
are yours milky white?

532
01:18:58,332 --> 01:18:59,890
Even l know about you.

533
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,463
We belong to the same community.

534
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:06,599
Community but not position.

535
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:11,837
You are a paid ass in this
business while l'm a lion!

536
01:19:12,879 --> 01:19:15,848
You've reached here because
you came with my child.

537
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:20,643
Otherwise my security dogs wouldn't
have let your bones come near me.

538
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:25,681
For the first time, l've
seen dogs guarding a lion!

539
01:19:27,694 --> 01:19:29,059
Listen to 2 things l have to say.

540
01:19:29,663 --> 01:19:33,064
ln today's world, lions
can be safe in only 2 places.

541
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,598
ln the circus and the zoo!

542
01:19:37,638 --> 01:19:40,129
Secondly regarding position.

543
01:19:41,508 --> 01:19:45,535
l can take you to that place..

544
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:48,545
That you're dreaming of for 20 years.

545
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:51,214
But can never reach it.

546
01:19:53,487 --> 01:19:54,351
Meaning?

547
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:42,065
Saw what l broke in place
of two teeth of mine?

548
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:46,466
Pomeranian Puppy!

549
01:20:47,941 --> 01:20:49,806
Give the line to your Pop,
the bulldog.

550
01:20:51,378 --> 01:20:53,471
- What is it?
- He called me a puppy!

551
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:55,079
And me?

552
01:20:56,116 --> 01:20:59,176
He called me a bulldog?
Give me the line!

553
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,020
Are we a family of dogs?

554
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:06,352
l didn't find you or
l'd have broken you too!

555
01:21:06,893 --> 01:21:09,487
You act smart with me!
l'm very bad!

556
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:12,061
You won't believe how rotten l am!

557
01:21:12,499 --> 01:21:14,228
We're a family of tigers not dogs!

558
01:21:14,801 --> 01:21:16,860
We bite not bark!

559
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:19,999
Are you frightened?

560
01:21:20,741 --> 01:21:23,608
Can you hear?

561
01:21:24,111 --> 01:21:26,841
l'm talking to you not myself!

562
01:21:28,281 --> 01:21:33,548
l've been yelling for ages!
l'm not mad!

563
01:21:34,187 --> 01:21:35,518
Total 8500.

564
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:38,017
- Plus 100% tax.
- What?

565
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:44,890
Total 17000.
Round figure 20000.

566
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:47,663
Which figure are you
rounding and squaring?

567
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:51,466
This is the damage
your son did to my house.

568
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,466
- You'll take money from me?
- Not rupees, in dollars.

569
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:59,943
My bill will reach you at 3.55

570
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:02,609
l'll come at 4 to take the cash.

571
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,275
And leave at 4.05.

572
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:09,721
10 minutes for giving and taking.

573
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:12,888
Take those 10 minutes seriously.

574
01:22:16,196 --> 01:22:18,460
- What happened?
- Nothing, he talks rot!

575
01:22:19,032 --> 01:22:21,125
Says he'll send the bill at 3.55

576
01:22:21,635 --> 01:22:25,093
And will leave at 4:05.
As if we're here to pay cash!

577
01:22:25,472 --> 01:22:31,672
The arms buyers would have come
Bring them in. Let me do some work.

578
01:22:35,515 --> 01:22:36,743
We have machine guns.

579
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:46,658
Even those not yet in the market.
We have 2 lakh pieces of each.

580
01:22:47,194 --> 01:22:49,128
We'll send you the guns you need.

581
01:22:52,599 --> 01:22:53,588
This is a pipe gun.

582
01:22:54,201 --> 01:23:01,130
With every pipe gun, you get
a dozen Hamam soaps free.

583
01:23:03,643 --> 01:23:05,167
Now show them our bomb section.

584
01:23:22,696 --> 01:23:24,027
- 3:55
- 3:55?

585
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:53,520
lt's the phone.

586
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:05,697
Don't be scared.
lt's the bill not a bomb.

587
01:24:11,344 --> 01:24:13,676
Do you think l'm scared?

588
01:24:14,281 --> 01:24:16,545
l play with such bombs day and night.

589
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:19,384
l deal in them. Where are you?

590
01:24:24,524 --> 01:24:27,152
- What?
- He's come downstairs.

591
01:24:29,162 --> 01:24:31,722
Tell him l'm taking the lift up.

592
01:26:58,686 --> 01:27:00,950
Well done.

593
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:03,254
You did very well!

594
01:27:04,325 --> 01:27:05,849
l thought you were good for nothing.

595
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,020
But you proved to be very smart!

596
01:27:10,565 --> 01:27:13,432
You deserve all the praise!

597
01:27:14,802 --> 01:27:17,566
And you called me a bulldog!

598
01:27:18,839 --> 01:27:22,741
Whether a dog bites or licks,
both are dangerous!

599
01:27:27,848 --> 01:27:28,974
His pistol is empty.

600
01:27:43,631 --> 01:27:46,691
Don't move or the bullet
will go off in your ear.

601
01:27:47,435 --> 01:27:48,834
But some other place will bleed.

602
01:27:50,037 --> 01:27:51,004
Cash.

603
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,347
Pomeranian puppy!

604
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:53,566
lt's a very big deal.

605
01:28:54,235 --> 01:28:55,759
- Call George.
- He's in hospital.

606
01:28:56,037 --> 01:28:58,972
- Then call Kalia or Rahim.
- They both are also in the hospital.

607
01:28:59,373 --> 01:29:01,341
ls the gorilla also
in the hospital?

608
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:03,336
Unfortunately he too
is in the hospital.

609
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:07,511
Have they gone to get a corpse
or have they all got aids?

610
01:29:07,882 --> 01:29:10,510
This is all because of that lndian.

611
01:29:11,252 --> 01:29:14,312
First he burnt my teeth
then he bashed up my men.

612
01:29:14,889 --> 01:29:17,255
He called me a pomeranian
puppy and him...

613
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:21,119
Then he did a miracle!

614
01:29:21,395 --> 01:29:24,159
- What?
- He thrashed Dad.

615
01:29:24,498 --> 01:29:26,898
He took money from him for all
the damage l did to his house.

616
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:35,199
Rascal! Recounting the tale of his
bashing as if he's won a medal!

617
01:29:35,776 --> 01:29:37,403
He's not an ordinary boy.

618
01:29:37,812 --> 01:29:42,078
Then is he King Kong? lf the
tale of my shame spreads,...

619
01:29:42,483 --> 01:29:44,246
l won't have the face
to return to Patna!

620
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:46,582
Take my marksman with you.

621
01:29:47,021 --> 01:29:53,620
Go, shoot him! lf you come without
shooting him, l'll shoot all of you!

622
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:31,157
The rascal's mother is coming.

623
01:30:32,633 --> 01:30:36,069
He will go to the
airport to receive her.

624
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:12,363
l'll kill him.

625
01:31:21,882 --> 01:31:22,780
Shoot.

626
01:31:27,221 --> 01:31:28,085
Shoot him!

627
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:34,324
Now!

628
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,794
Where's that rascal come from?

629
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:48,099
- Mother has come.
- Now!

630
01:31:52,213 --> 01:31:53,145
Shoot Jojo!

631
01:32:00,254 --> 01:32:01,346
Sister-in-law?

632
01:32:04,058 --> 01:32:05,616
- Stop!
- What's wrong?

633
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,852
This is my sister-in-law!

634
01:32:09,597 --> 01:32:12,464
That means this is my
elder brother's son!

635
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,560
This is our own blood!

636
01:32:15,169 --> 01:32:22,598
lf brother hears this good news,
he'll will me all his Patna property!

637
01:32:48,335 --> 01:32:49,461
Uncle will be happy to hear it!

638
01:32:54,141 --> 01:32:57,304
- ln Australia?
- Yes!

639
01:32:57,978 --> 01:33:02,472
The boy we went to kill
is actually your son!

640
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:06,115
My son! My wife!

641
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:10,584
l can't believe it!
Are you telling the truth?

642
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:13,319
Yes. Jojo, you tell him
what you have seen.

643
01:33:13,727 --> 01:33:18,426
Dad is right. We ourselves saw
brother Vicky touching her feet.

644
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:22,536
My son!

645
01:33:28,509 --> 01:33:29,874
You've come to the wrong address.

646
01:33:30,978 --> 01:33:33,913
Vicky's mother stays
here not your wife.

647
01:33:34,415 --> 01:33:38,784
Think why fate has brought
us together in a foreign land?

648
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,547
Just so that we live together.

649
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:45,892
An child who pretends to be
an orphan will get his father.

650
01:33:46,694 --> 01:33:50,653
Orphans are kids who have
neither father nor mother.

651
01:33:51,765 --> 01:33:54,199
And Vicky's mother is alive.

652
01:33:54,735 --> 01:34:00,139
Don't be adamant. Today l have
so much wealth l can buy anything.

653
01:34:00,908 --> 01:34:04,344
Then go and buy yourself
a wife and a son.

654
01:34:05,412 --> 01:34:09,815
People who sell themselves for
money don't live in this house.

655
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:14,444
Please forget everything.
l apologise on brother's behalf.

656
01:34:17,191 --> 01:34:20,024
The man who sells his motherland...

657
01:34:20,894 --> 01:34:23,192
Who is responsible for
the death of innocents...

658
01:34:24,264 --> 01:34:27,631
They deserve punishment
not forgiveness.

659
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:30,562
You may leave.

660
01:34:31,472 --> 01:34:33,633
Listen to me.

661
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:39,370
Brother, this is your son!

662
01:34:48,756 --> 01:34:51,554
- You don't know me, son...
- l know.

663
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:53,918
l heard everything.

664
01:34:55,162 --> 01:34:57,289
Son! My son!

665
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,397
Don't be angry with me.

666
01:35:02,469 --> 01:35:04,699
l'm pining for you since 20 years!

667
01:35:05,572 --> 01:35:08,473
Even l've been pining for
my father for 20 years!

668
01:35:10,344 --> 01:35:13,006
Blood is thicker than water.

669
01:35:19,153 --> 01:35:22,589
- Now if Shanti agrees...
- Leave her to me.

670
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:24,279
l'll convince her.

671
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:29,021
Organize a great party now!

672
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:33,459
l'll announce to the world
that l'm not childless!

673
01:35:35,002 --> 01:35:38,768
His son who will work with him
shoulder to shoulder has come!

674
01:36:05,866 --> 01:36:07,458
- You?
- Yes?

675
01:36:08,102 --> 01:36:10,730
- You have a brother? - Yes.
- Twin? - Yes.

676
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:12,670
- Lost in the fair?
- Yes.

677
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:16,607
- He's come to look for you
from lndia! - Where is he?

678
01:36:16,877 --> 01:36:19,744
- He becomes a policeman, waiter..
- And sometimes band master!

679
01:36:20,547 --> 01:36:22,344
You always find me only!

680
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:25,083
l'm Mohan!

681
01:36:26,053 --> 01:36:28,647
l thought my brother would
have become a smuggler.

682
01:36:29,356 --> 01:36:31,085
They keep having parties.

683
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:34,124
Someday l'll find him
singing and dancing.

684
01:36:34,795 --> 01:36:38,424
Lord! Why did you make fairs?

685
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,237
Welcome Pratap!

686
01:36:49,276 --> 01:36:53,679
- How are you?
- Very well.

687
01:36:54,314 --> 01:36:55,281
She's my daughter.

688
01:36:57,284 --> 01:37:00,048
You've grown so big!
Where do you live?

689
01:37:00,821 --> 01:37:04,279
- l haven't seen you for ages.
- l stay separately as l'm studying.

690
01:37:04,992 --> 01:37:08,519
Congrats for finding your
wife and son after 20 years!

691
01:37:09,196 --> 01:37:11,790
- Where are they?
- My wife hasn't come.

692
01:37:12,299 --> 01:37:14,028
l'll introduce you to my son.

693
01:37:15,402 --> 01:37:17,336
Come here son.

694
01:37:27,181 --> 01:37:28,148
ls this your son?

695
01:37:29,449 --> 01:37:32,885
Yes. Got a start seeing him?

696
01:37:33,387 --> 01:37:36,652
And why not? Till yesterday
Pratap was our equal every way.

697
01:37:37,424 --> 01:37:41,087
But after son's arrival our
strength has grown 4 times!

698
01:37:42,396 --> 01:37:45,058
The enemy gets startled.

699
01:37:45,599 --> 01:37:48,727
Not our friends. And he is our pal.

700
01:37:58,846 --> 01:38:05,410
ln lndia, elders give blessings
not congratulations.

701
01:38:07,087 --> 01:38:09,351
Do you know each other?

702
01:38:10,357 --> 01:38:13,815
Now it's your turn to get startled.

703
01:38:14,494 --> 01:38:18,794
He's your son later. First he
became my to-be son-in-law!

704
01:38:19,499 --> 01:38:24,266
Meaning your son and my
daughter are in love.

705
01:38:25,472 --> 01:38:30,432
- What? - Yes, uncle. For her
Vicky brother burnt my teeth.

706
01:38:31,745 --> 01:38:34,543
So my son hasn't come alone!

707
01:38:34,982 --> 01:38:38,474
He's brought his bride alone!
What are you looking at?

708
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:40,150
Open up champagne immediately!

709
01:38:40,587 --> 01:38:42,020
lt's a joyous occasion!

710
01:44:06,313 --> 01:44:07,644
Where are we going, Dad?

711
01:44:08,848 --> 01:44:15,412
You are my heir so it's essential
you know what l've earned in my life.

712
01:44:16,189 --> 01:44:17,451
And where l've hidden it.

713
01:44:24,331 --> 01:44:26,822
This path leads to that
secret place of mine...

714
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,433
That nobody including my
brother knows nothing about.

715
01:44:31,471 --> 01:44:35,373
l've brought you here so that l can
tell you the secrets of my business.

716
01:44:36,142 --> 01:44:37,905
Finally you have to take over.

717
01:44:40,113 --> 01:44:41,978
Come my son.

718
01:44:46,353 --> 01:44:47,615
l'm very happy today.

719
01:44:48,121 --> 01:44:53,491
ln one day you fulfilled
my dreams of years!

720
01:44:54,094 --> 01:44:56,619
A father's dream is to
get his son married.

721
01:44:57,063 --> 01:45:02,695
Not for that but because
you trapped that rascal's girl...

722
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:05,237
And brought him to my feet!

723
01:45:06,139 --> 01:45:08,767
What are you saying?
Pratap is your friend.

724
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:14,308
What friend? lf he gets the
chance, he'll gobble up his friend!

725
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:18,547
But l'm no less. You must
have heard the magician's story?

726
01:45:19,019 --> 01:45:20,611
His life was in a parrot.

727
01:45:21,288 --> 01:45:24,485
Pratap's life is in my hands.

728
01:45:25,525 --> 01:45:28,756
- l don't follow.
- That's why l brought you here.

729
01:45:37,737 --> 01:45:42,834
This is that parrot in which
the proof of Pratap's evil deeds...

730
01:45:43,209 --> 01:45:45,234
...is written with dates.

731
01:45:48,248 --> 01:45:50,239
This is our third partner Jaswant.

732
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:55,444
He is no more. And this is
our fourth partner, D. K.

733
01:45:56,156 --> 01:45:57,555
He stays in lndia.

734
01:46:01,895 --> 01:46:05,456
You are right. Pratap's life
is really in your hands.

735
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:10,360
But the problem is that
my life is in his hands.

736
01:46:11,371 --> 01:46:13,839
Pratap has a similar file on me.

737
01:46:15,342 --> 01:46:18,402
That is why l've agreed
to have relations with him.

738
01:46:19,212 --> 01:46:24,343
So that as his son-in-law
you can get my file from him.

739
01:46:25,852 --> 01:46:30,516
Then you'll see how l
give him a rat's death!

740
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:36,057
And then l'll put all
my burden on your shoulders.

741
01:46:36,429 --> 01:46:38,021
l'll sleep in peace.

742
01:46:39,032 --> 01:46:41,728
What use is the son who
can't put his father to sleep?

743
01:50:06,139 --> 01:50:07,265
l haven't seen Dad since yesterday.

744
01:50:07,907 --> 01:50:12,173
You won't believe the calls
that have come since morning.

745
01:50:12,645 --> 01:50:16,274
So many inquiries. But they
will speak only if they know.

746
01:50:29,996 --> 01:50:33,363
What are you saying?

747
01:50:35,868 --> 01:50:36,960
Yes, he's here.

748
01:50:40,039 --> 01:50:41,006
Where will he go?

749
01:50:42,308 --> 01:50:44,276
Come here.

750
01:50:49,048 --> 01:50:50,447
Now you can't escape!

751
01:50:51,517 --> 01:50:52,882
Your secret is out!

752
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,848
- What secret?
- Hear it yourself.

753
01:51:02,795 --> 01:51:05,229
lt's you?

754
01:51:08,034 --> 01:51:09,433
Got you scared!

755
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,867
Do you remember it's a
girl's birthday today?

756
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:16,875
- Which girl's?
- One innocent girl.

757
01:51:17,343 --> 01:51:20,278
Who is trapped in a foolish,
absent minded boy's love.

758
01:51:20,813 --> 01:51:24,044
lf he's absent minded
he will obviously forget.

759
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:28,181
The girl should have thought
of this before falling in love.

760
01:51:28,621 --> 01:51:30,486
She had no experience of love.

761
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:34,187
That's how she made a mistake.
Now what is she to do?

762
01:51:34,827 --> 01:51:36,658
She must trust the boy.

763
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:40,099
l'll catch that fool and bring him.

764
01:51:40,566 --> 01:51:43,091
How will that foolish boy
recognize that girl?

765
01:51:43,536 --> 01:51:47,666
That won't be necessary.
That boy is so special..

766
01:51:48,274 --> 01:51:51,243
That the girl will
come running to him

767
01:51:52,045 --> 01:51:55,173
lt's also possible that
the boy will be left watching

768
01:51:55,815 --> 01:51:57,646
And the girl goes away
with another!

769
01:51:58,751 --> 01:52:00,946
Fine, so let's see.

770
01:52:22,642 --> 01:52:24,405
Looks like somebody's
heart is burning

771
01:53:19,499 --> 01:53:20,932
Looks like there's a fire somewhere.

772
01:53:21,768 --> 01:53:22,792
Should l call the fire brigade?

773
01:57:31,584 --> 01:57:33,347
God! What have you done?

774
01:57:34,653 --> 01:57:36,052
Taken my brother away!

775
01:57:41,827 --> 01:57:45,558
Uncle, why are you crying?
Why are the police here?

776
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:52,637
You won't believe this son.
Somebody killed your father!

777
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:56,338
- What? - Killed him and
fed the body to sharks.

778
01:57:56,809 --> 01:58:00,142
lf he was fed to dogs,
we could have found his bones!

779
01:58:00,679 --> 01:58:04,547
- To cremate him.
- Now how will we do the rites?

780
01:58:10,489 --> 01:58:12,081
l can't understand what he's saying.

781
01:58:13,059 --> 01:58:15,892
He's asking whose lighter this is.

782
01:58:16,962 --> 01:58:20,454
l don't know. My brother never...

783
01:58:32,011 --> 01:58:33,569
Why did you say the
lighter belongs to brother?

784
01:58:34,213 --> 01:58:35,976
He hadn't touched a
cigarette for 20 years!

785
01:58:36,315 --> 01:58:41,878
l knew Dad didn't smoke. This belongs
to the man who killed him

786
01:58:44,023 --> 01:58:48,119
l lied because the
police cannot harm him.

787
01:58:48,594 --> 01:58:49,891
Tell me who he is!

788
01:58:50,162 --> 01:58:53,131
He fed brother to the fish!

789
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,535
lf l don't feed him to the
maggots, shame on my name!

790
01:58:57,937 --> 01:58:58,904
Tell me who he is!

791
01:59:01,807 --> 01:59:04,901
Think of where you saw this lighter.

792
01:59:17,289 --> 01:59:18,881
This belongs to Pratap.

793
01:59:22,995 --> 01:59:26,226
The scoundrel extended
his hand for relations...

794
01:59:27,433 --> 01:59:28,991
And cheated us!

795
01:59:30,002 --> 01:59:32,300
l'll kill that bastard!

796
01:59:32,605 --> 01:59:37,542
No! Those who work in excitement
are either under the earth...

797
01:59:38,077 --> 01:59:42,514
Or over the pyre. So we must
work with our senses not anger.

798
01:59:43,916 --> 01:59:46,646
Collect all your men.

799
01:59:47,486 --> 01:59:50,853
We'll attack Pratap together!

800
02:00:05,371 --> 02:00:09,137
Now what do we do?

801
02:00:09,808 --> 02:00:12,106
- Hide the weapons.
- Call up.

802
02:00:29,962 --> 02:00:31,020
Where is everybody?

803
02:00:33,499 --> 02:00:34,591
l'll check.

804
02:02:16,468 --> 02:02:17,560
Well done.

805
02:02:20,439 --> 02:02:25,433
l kept my promise of killing
all of Virendra's group.

806
02:02:25,911 --> 02:02:27,538
Just half.

807
02:02:28,914 --> 02:02:31,678
Where's my file Virendra had?

808
02:02:32,251 --> 02:02:37,382
You'll get it. First you keep
your word of giving Preeti to me.

809
02:02:39,091 --> 02:02:40,058
Tell me, when?

810
02:02:45,331 --> 02:02:46,958
Whenever the bride and groom wish.

811
02:07:15,601 --> 02:07:18,161
l can't believe somebody
can love some one so much!

812
02:07:19,204 --> 02:07:21,195
As much as you love Preeti.

813
02:07:22,274 --> 02:07:26,404
You killed your own father
just because l asked you to!

814
02:07:27,646 --> 02:07:28,704
He wasn't my father!

815
02:07:31,149 --> 02:07:34,915
- What? - A bastard like
him cannot be my father!

816
02:07:36,888 --> 02:07:41,018
l made him my father
so that l can reach him.

817
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:46,460
lf he wasn't your father,
how did he accept you as his son?

818
02:07:47,699 --> 02:07:49,098
Because of his wife.

819
02:07:50,602 --> 02:07:52,263
His son was lost years ago.

820
02:07:53,572 --> 02:07:56,234
l went to him as his lost son.

821
02:07:57,342 --> 02:08:02,837
And it was not difficult convincing
a mother mad for her lost son.

822
02:08:06,251 --> 02:08:08,412
What a trick!

823
02:08:09,621 --> 02:08:11,350
Hunted so many with one arrow!

824
02:08:12,124 --> 02:08:16,458
Virendra's wealth,
my daughter and my trust.

825
02:08:17,229 --> 02:08:24,135
You turned out to be
smarter than l thought.

826
02:08:25,404 --> 02:08:27,895
Today you killed Virendra
making him your father.

827
02:08:28,807 --> 02:08:32,834
Tomorrow you might kill me
after l become your father-in-law.

828
02:08:34,579 --> 02:08:40,609
l'm no fool like Virendra!

829
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:44,948
The file has come to me. Hence..

830
02:08:56,034 --> 02:08:58,264
You're more foolish than Virendra.

831
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:03,897
You should check the bullets
before pressing the trigger.

832
02:09:05,243 --> 02:09:07,677
The man who can remove your
file from Virendra's vault...

833
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:11,945
lt's not tough for him to remove
the bullets from your revolver.

834
02:09:17,355 --> 02:09:21,223
l was joking, son!

835
02:09:22,227 --> 02:09:24,127
Brothers-in-law joke.

836
02:09:24,663 --> 02:09:26,221
Not father-in-law with son-in-law.

837
02:09:28,867 --> 02:09:30,698
That is why listen
to something serious.

838
02:09:31,903 --> 02:09:36,203
l killed Virendra for
DK not your daughter!

839
02:09:37,909 --> 02:09:43,006
He gave me a contract
to kill three people.

840
02:09:44,116 --> 02:09:46,744
One was Jaswant.
The other Virendra.

841
02:09:47,853 --> 02:09:48,945
And you're the third.

842
02:09:51,990 --> 02:09:54,754
Bless your daughter thanks
to whom you are still alive.

843
02:09:55,994 --> 02:09:58,428
l used her as a step to reach you.

844
02:09:59,765 --> 02:10:03,531
But l really love her so much...

845
02:10:04,569 --> 02:10:06,400
That l can't fill her eyes with tears.

846
02:10:07,372 --> 02:10:11,706
You won Preeti's heart earlier
Today you've won mine too.

847
02:10:12,644 --> 02:10:14,544
Forget the heart and
think with the head.

848
02:10:15,747 --> 02:10:18,147
DK wants you dead to own 100%

849
02:10:19,117 --> 02:10:23,713
But l can kill him and
make you the complete owner.

850
02:10:29,895 --> 02:10:31,760
- But his whereabouts..?
- l know that.

851
02:10:33,565 --> 02:10:35,430
Prepare to leave for lndia.

852
02:10:37,169 --> 02:10:40,104
To kill that rascal,
why just lndia..

853
02:10:41,106 --> 02:10:43,040
l'm willing to go anywhere.

854
02:10:45,877 --> 02:10:50,177
So far l thought l was the
luckiest girl in the world.

855
02:10:51,216 --> 02:10:54,481
But today after listening
to my father and Vicky...

856
02:10:55,187 --> 02:10:58,281
l've lost faith in all relations!

857
02:10:59,558 --> 02:11:03,016
lf you hear, you'll die!

858
02:11:04,729 --> 02:11:07,527
The one you think is
your son, is not your son!

859
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:11,963
He became your son so that
he could kill your husband.

860
02:11:12,771 --> 02:11:14,398
Vicky killed your husband!

861
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:17,374
He made you a widow!
He is a cheat!

862
02:11:19,578 --> 02:11:20,567
l know it.

863
02:11:22,447 --> 02:11:23,914
He is not my son.

864
02:11:25,984 --> 02:11:27,349
He has not cheated me.

865
02:11:29,054 --> 02:11:32,421
ln fact, to lighten mother
earth of her sinful burden...

866
02:11:33,291 --> 02:11:34,918
l supported him by
becoming his mother

867
02:11:37,762 --> 02:11:39,457
And he didn't kill my husband!

868
02:11:40,765 --> 02:11:43,029
He punished a traitor for his sins!

869
02:11:45,837 --> 02:11:51,332
Those who die for their
nation are called martyrs.

870
02:11:52,644 --> 02:11:58,605
Those who kill for their country
are called soldiers not killers!

871
02:12:02,087 --> 02:12:05,648
And this soldier's story
started not on foreign soil...

872
02:12:06,825 --> 02:12:09,555
But in the desert sands of lndia.

873
02:12:11,296 --> 02:12:13,924
Where my husband and your father..

874
02:12:15,066 --> 02:12:18,968
And their third partner,
Jaswant worked in the military.

875
02:12:20,205 --> 02:12:25,006
They stole arms from there and
sold it to a fourth called DK.

876
02:12:27,078 --> 02:12:32,983
Once Vicky's father, Major
Malhotra caught them red handed

877
02:12:34,419 --> 02:12:38,321
To hide their crime,
these traitors killed him!

878
02:12:39,424 --> 02:12:42,086
And blamed him for the arms theft!

879
02:12:42,827 --> 02:12:45,261
We were going towards the
border with the truck of arms.

880
02:12:45,797 --> 02:12:51,326
The truck had a problem so Major
Malhotra sent us to camp to get help

881
02:12:52,037 --> 02:12:54,870
On the way we saw a
civilian driving the truck.

882
02:12:55,307 --> 02:12:58,299
We smelled a rat and
returned to see...

883
02:12:58,944 --> 02:13:02,038
All the guards were dead and Major
Malhotra and his men were ...

884
02:13:02,614 --> 02:13:04,775
...loading the arms into their truck.

885
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:08,783
We challenged him and
he fired upon us in return.

886
02:13:09,254 --> 02:13:10,949
We had to fire back to answer him.

887
02:13:12,223 --> 02:13:15,556
On the evidence of the eye witness
account of Subhedar Pratap Singh...

888
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:18,624
Lance Corporal Virendra Sinha
and driver Jaswant Dalal...

889
02:13:19,230 --> 02:13:27,160
Maj. Malhotra is charged with loot of
arms meant for the nation's defense

890
02:13:27,439 --> 02:13:29,066
He is guilty of killing the
guards defending the country.

891
02:13:30,175 --> 02:13:34,339
So the army terminates
his entire service.

892
02:13:34,879 --> 02:13:40,579
We take back all the titles, medals
given to him and declare him a traitor

893
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:44,250
No! No!

894
02:13:47,993 --> 02:13:50,223
He is not a traitor!

895
02:13:50,829 --> 02:13:54,287
- Mother!
- Don't take his medals!

896
02:13:58,603 --> 02:14:08,342
Sir, you know how much
he loved his country!

897
02:14:09,114 --> 02:14:12,550
Then why are they snatching
away the medals in front of you?

898
02:14:13,485 --> 02:14:16,045
He is a martyr not a traitor!

899
02:14:17,122 --> 02:14:21,491
He has sacrificed
himself for his country!

900
02:14:33,371 --> 02:14:34,929
We won't let the body be burnt!

901
02:14:37,008 --> 02:14:45,177
We won't let a traitor be
cremated on our holy land!

902
02:14:45,884 --> 02:14:48,876
Don't touch it!

903
02:14:49,254 --> 02:14:50,221
Throw the body away!

904
02:15:25,423 --> 02:15:26,151
Mother!

905
02:16:25,817 --> 02:16:28,149
Mother earth took that
martyr into her lap.

906
02:16:29,154 --> 02:16:32,248
Yet these traitors
had evil intentions

907
02:16:33,191 --> 02:16:36,319
They put the stigma of
shame on his mother's head.

908
02:16:36,761 --> 02:16:38,626
And threw her out of the village!

909
02:16:55,079 --> 02:16:59,778
Sister, l've come to
take you and Raju.

910
02:17:01,186 --> 02:17:02,585
We'll go and stay faraway.

911
02:17:05,523 --> 02:17:14,090
No. lf l leave this place,
his soul will tell me...

912
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:19,860
That like others l too
think he's a traitor.

913
02:17:21,372 --> 02:17:26,332
Take Raju away if you can.

914
02:17:31,049 --> 02:17:34,212
But how will he live without you?

915
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:37,654
His welfare lies in
staying without me.

916
02:17:40,124 --> 02:17:42,718
Son can forget his mother.

917
02:17:44,562 --> 02:17:50,626
But the people here will remind
him of his father and kill him!

918
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:53,859
Take him away!

919
02:17:57,008 --> 02:17:59,067
Will you live without me, mother?

920
02:18:00,378 --> 02:18:01,572
No, my son!

921
02:18:03,114 --> 02:18:04,843
You are not separating from me.

922
02:18:05,583 --> 02:18:09,986
l'll be with you every
moment in every breath.

923
02:18:12,323 --> 02:18:15,520
l'll go if you want me to.

924
02:18:45,623 --> 02:18:49,787
And from that day to this,
neither did she see her son...

925
02:18:51,129 --> 02:18:52,756
Nor did the son see his mother.

926
02:18:55,333 --> 02:18:58,598
For 20 years that goddess
is still in the desert...

927
02:18:59,137 --> 02:19:03,039
Tolerating the barbs of the villagers

928
02:19:03,708 --> 02:19:05,175
Sitting in that same temple.

929
02:19:11,449 --> 02:19:12,416
What's the matter?

930
02:19:14,519 --> 02:19:20,287
l hope you don't feel you're
guilty of making me a widow?

931
02:19:23,194 --> 02:19:25,526
l considered myself a widow the day..

932
02:19:27,065 --> 02:19:33,800
When my own son died along with
other kids because of arms he sold!

933
02:19:37,942 --> 02:19:43,744
The man who can kill the
husband's of hundreds of women..

934
02:19:43,981 --> 02:19:45,414
And is responsible for
the death of innocent kids...

935
02:19:45,683 --> 02:19:47,844
No lndian woman not just me...

936
02:19:48,152 --> 02:19:50,848
...will adorn her hair with
the vermilion of his name!

937
02:19:51,622 --> 02:19:57,083
l'm proud of you son!

938
02:19:58,329 --> 02:20:01,696
The day that was lowered in shame
because of my husband's deeds...

939
02:20:02,433 --> 02:20:04,765
lt is held high once
again thanks to you.

940
02:20:10,041 --> 02:20:12,976
lt is said, of all God's gifts..

941
02:20:14,112 --> 02:20:16,239
The most precious is mother.

942
02:20:19,384 --> 02:20:23,616
l am so lucky that l have 2 of them!

943
02:20:35,566 --> 02:20:37,659
What you did was out of ignorance.

944
02:20:38,503 --> 02:20:43,133
But after knowing what l'm going
to do, you'll hate not love me.

945
02:20:45,376 --> 02:20:48,038
Your father's name is top most
in my list of enemies.

946
02:20:50,014 --> 02:20:53,814
lf a wife can support you against
her husband in your fight ...

947
02:20:54,419 --> 02:20:58,378
Then a daughter can go against
her father for mankind!

948
02:21:07,064 --> 02:21:07,928
Raj here.

949
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:13,234
Why did you call?
Keep contact only by fax.

950
02:21:13,638 --> 02:21:18,132
No need for that now.
l'm bringing Pratap tomorrow.

951
02:21:19,277 --> 02:21:21,177
My work here is done.

952
02:21:22,747 --> 02:21:25,511
Now l have to come
there and do one job.

953
02:21:26,951 --> 02:21:28,612
Unmask DK.

954
02:22:01,319 --> 02:22:05,016
- Yes sir?
- The drama my man enacted..

955
02:22:05,523 --> 02:22:07,286
Of killing you with fake bullets..

956
02:22:07,959 --> 02:22:09,426
That has made my plan succeed.

957
02:22:09,994 --> 02:22:12,087
How long do l have to stay here?

958
02:22:12,663 --> 02:22:14,358
There's no need for you to stay.

959
02:22:15,132 --> 02:22:20,502
With the information you gave me
my partner killed Virendra and his men

960
02:22:22,006 --> 02:22:24,304
He's bringing Pratap here tomorrow.

961
02:22:25,476 --> 02:22:27,774
So now you're free.

962
02:23:19,163 --> 02:23:20,255
lt's so strange...

963
02:23:21,232 --> 02:23:24,929
The story will end where it began.

964
02:23:26,137 --> 02:23:27,968
Looks like you know this place.

965
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:30,305
What's the use in hiding from you?

966
02:23:31,008 --> 02:23:34,000
Our business started from here.

967
02:23:35,079 --> 02:23:38,947
And this is the place where
death touched us and left.

968
02:23:39,784 --> 02:23:43,220
There was a scoundrel Major Malhotra.

969
02:23:44,922 --> 02:23:47,447
He thought he was the
protector of the nation!

970
02:23:48,359 --> 02:23:49,348
He caught us.

971
02:23:50,161 --> 02:23:54,097
lf DK hadn't reached in time,
he would have killed all of us.

972
02:23:55,366 --> 02:23:57,300
That dog was very strong!

973
02:23:58,569 --> 02:24:00,366
But fate was with us.

974
02:24:01,339 --> 02:24:03,739
We gave that scoundrel such a death!

975
02:24:04,342 --> 02:24:06,537
That it's quoted as an example.

976
02:24:07,478 --> 02:24:11,209
We proved the martyr a traitor.

977
02:24:12,083 --> 02:24:14,142
We didn't let him be cremated!

978
02:24:18,289 --> 02:24:21,349
Some will die today too.
But won't be cremated.

979
02:24:22,259 --> 02:24:25,057
Of DK and his men!

980
02:24:33,571 --> 02:24:34,469
Why did you stop the car?

981
02:24:40,711 --> 02:24:43,578
A goddess is sitting in
this temple for 20 years.

982
02:24:45,149 --> 02:24:49,586
They say anyone who sees her
gets his wishes fulfilled.

983
02:24:51,489 --> 02:24:52,615
Let's go see her.

984
02:24:55,926 --> 02:24:57,587
l will see her.

985
02:24:58,763 --> 02:25:01,698
So that l can see
DK's corpse very soon.

986
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:26,807
For 20 years these eyes have only
seen hatred and been shunned.

987
02:26:28,486 --> 02:26:30,215
l have seen them everyday.

988
02:26:32,423 --> 02:26:42,264
But for the first time,
l'm seeing eyes filled with tears.

989
02:26:49,206 --> 02:26:50,002
Mother!

990
02:26:57,882 --> 02:27:00,510
l kept you away for 20 years!

991
02:27:02,086 --> 02:27:06,455
Despite being a mother,
l didn't give you that love.

992
02:27:08,526 --> 02:27:10,790
Forgive me!

993
02:27:11,996 --> 02:27:16,990
No, you were not away from me.

994
02:27:18,169 --> 02:27:24,540
The dust of your feet was
always with me like a blessing.

995
02:27:27,711 --> 02:27:32,375
Now it's time for your wait
and my pledge to be fulfilled.

996
02:27:33,784 --> 02:27:36,275
See whom l've brought here!

997
02:27:52,469 --> 02:27:53,834
You mother and son can't stay here!

998
02:27:54,405 --> 02:27:58,273
She won't leave like this. We'll
put such a stigma on her forehead..

999
02:27:58,676 --> 02:28:00,234
That she won't be able
to face anyone!

1000
02:28:11,622 --> 02:28:14,989
Leave my child!

1001
02:28:36,914 --> 02:28:38,711
l'm the son of this goddess!

1002
02:28:41,986 --> 02:28:44,181
This is that goddess...

1003
02:28:44,455 --> 02:28:49,688
Of whose forehead you wrote
the stigma of shame, not pride!

1004
02:28:50,027 --> 02:28:51,892
l'm the son of Vijay Malhotra!

1005
02:28:52,329 --> 02:28:55,856
Who was called a traitor
despite being a martyr!

1006
02:28:57,368 --> 02:28:59,029
Do you know why l brought you here?

1007
02:29:00,304 --> 02:29:03,432
So that the soul where the
greatest injustice was done...

1008
02:29:05,276 --> 02:29:07,176
Justice too should be given there!

1009
02:29:09,213 --> 02:29:12,705
And my mother who has been
doing penance in this wilderness..

1010
02:29:14,118 --> 02:29:16,416
Can see justice being done!

1011
02:29:39,109 --> 02:29:44,308
People die but their voices don't!

1012
02:29:46,650 --> 02:29:55,080
Listen! Listen to the voice
of my father's torture in this sand!

1013
02:30:03,934 --> 02:30:07,961
Listen to a child cry
and weep for his father!

1014
02:30:09,940 --> 02:30:13,398
Hear the scream of a mother looking
for her husband's body in a storm!

1015
02:30:15,813 --> 02:30:17,337
Hear my mother's screams!

1016
02:30:29,626 --> 02:30:31,253
Hear my mother's screams!

1017
02:30:50,848 --> 02:30:52,713
Not DK but Jaswant.

1018
02:30:58,922 --> 02:31:00,719
l recognized you mush earlier.

1019
02:31:02,326 --> 02:31:04,886
You haven't come here
but been brought here.

1020
02:31:05,863 --> 02:31:09,560
According to Raju's plan
l informed you of Pratap's arrival.

1021
02:31:10,267 --> 02:31:17,070
Because we know you would come
here to save him for your business.

1022
02:31:17,941 --> 02:31:21,274
And since Jaswant has been
forgiven by the law...

1023
02:31:21,979 --> 02:31:25,278
You'll be tried as DK not Jaswant!

1024
02:31:26,550 --> 02:31:30,008
You cheated your partners
for their shares.

1025
02:32:10,027 --> 02:32:13,929
Did you think l'd come
alone to save my man?

1026
02:32:37,621 --> 02:32:39,088
Wanted me to hear screams?

1027
02:32:39,456 --> 02:32:40,650
Now you hear the screams!

1028
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:59,074
Mother!

1029
02:33:33,210 --> 02:33:36,236
This rascal is Vijay Malhotra's son

1030
02:33:37,648 --> 02:33:39,411
His father was buried here
after his death.

1031
02:33:40,450 --> 02:33:41,576
Bury him alive!

1032
02:37:10,193 --> 02:37:12,093
Let's go or he'll kill us!

1033
02:38:27,170 --> 02:38:28,432
Don't kill us!

1034
02:38:28,672 --> 02:38:33,575
l'm your father-in-law.
Will you kill me, son?

1035
02:38:39,416 --> 02:38:40,974
l won't kill you.

1036
02:38:46,590 --> 02:38:47,921
He's so merciful!

1037
02:38:48,925 --> 02:38:51,223
After all he's my son-in-law.

1038
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:55,088
Look up.

1039
02:39:08,545 --> 02:39:10,809
These vultures will eat our flesh!

1040
02:39:12,782 --> 02:39:15,148
- Shoot us!
- Yes, kill us!

1041
02:39:16,086 --> 02:39:18,953
- For God's sake!
- l had pledged...

1042
02:39:21,424 --> 02:39:24,291
That you will neither get
the flames of a cremation...

1043
02:39:25,328 --> 02:39:27,262
Nor the lap of mother earth!

1044
02:39:27,831 --> 02:39:29,059
No!

1045
02:39:34,437 --> 02:39:38,669
l gave false evidence
against your father!

1046
02:39:39,409 --> 02:39:41,775
l had whipped him to death!

1047
02:39:42,345 --> 02:39:47,146
We are butchers! Remove
your revolver and kill me!

1048
02:39:48,118 --> 02:39:51,019
You are educated, sensible.
Why don't you kill us?

1049
02:39:51,888 --> 02:39:55,187
Villagers! We accept all our crimes

1050
02:39:55,926 --> 02:39:58,861
Save us from the vultures.
We can't even walk!

1051
02:39:59,863 --> 02:40:02,423
Kill us! Wait!

1052
02:40:03,633 --> 02:40:07,626
On your goddess like mother's
forehead, l had written...

1053
02:40:08,138 --> 02:40:12,632
Your husband is a traitor! You
write on my forehead with bullets.

1054
02:40:13,376 --> 02:40:15,571
That l'm a dog, a pig, a swine!

1055
02:40:17,113 --> 02:40:19,843
- Stop!
- Don't leave us and go!

1056
02:40:55,352 --> 02:40:59,118
Gun salute!
