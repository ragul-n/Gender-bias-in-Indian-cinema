1
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,250
"Gopal is a good boy.

2
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:31,917
He never idles away his time.

3
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,708
He performs his tasks on time.

4
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:40,833
He doesn't waste time by playing
when he is supposed to study."

5
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:48,125
'Borno Porichoi', the book of alphabets
by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

6
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,416
You must have read it as a kid, Shaon.

7
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,375
Know it by heart even, or not?

8
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:54,139
What?

9
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:56,847
Sorry, sorry, sorry...

10
00:01:56,889 --> 00:02:00,264
You are in no state to talk.

11
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,681
What can I do?

12
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,264
My hands are tied.

13
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:07,847
Even I like to do everything
at the right time.

14
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:11,889
I'm not the bad guy
just because I've brought you here.

15
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,431
I'm really not the villain.

16
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:16,347
Believe me, I'm really good.

17
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:17,472
What?

18
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:18,681
What?

19
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,639
Yeah, you're right.

20
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,097
I'm not a boy.

21
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:26,972
That's there.

22
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,055
"Light a match...

23
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,972
and you'll get fire."

24
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,555
You must have heard the song.

25
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:38,764
Asha Bhonsle?

26
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,306
The song is a little naughty.

27
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:45,014
Smoking is injurious to health.

28
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,597
It causes cancer.

29
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,972
What about the cancer affecting
our society, Shaon?

30
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:56,014
Say this body of yours...

31
00:02:56,306 --> 00:03:00,472
It'll end up in a forensic lab
all butchered up.

32
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:07,014
But it's more important to get rid of the
cancerous growth in the society, isn't it?

33
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,222
Yes?

34
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:09,597
Oh, no!

35
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,055
I'm not like Rajnikanth.

36
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,805
I can't walk in like a hero
and change the society.

37
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:15,931
I don't have society's responsiblity.

38
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,293
I'm only resposnsible for myself.

39
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,264
I'm not a hero.

40
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,389
Be right back.

41
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:29,263
You see, Shaon...

42
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:32,472
I love playing with fire.

43
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,806
You love playing with fire too,
don't you?

44
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,471
You can't say no now.

45
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:39,014
I know that you do.

46
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:42,181
The fire as our witness today,
we'll find out...

47
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,431
Who does fire love more?

48
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,472
That's it.
We're almost done.

49
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:50,889
Stop fidgeting.

50
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:54,930
Five thousand years ago,
in Egypt...

51
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:56,722
when pharoahs died...

52
00:03:56,764 --> 00:04:01,306
they were buried
with their favourite things.

53
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,347
You see this?

54
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:05,764
Your favourite thing, money.
I got everything for you.

55
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:08,123
I must keep so many things in mind.

56
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,806
That's why I told you
I'm extremely good.

57
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:13,472
Now you have proof.

58
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,056
You see this?

59
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:28,014
<i>Someone comes close...</i>

60
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:38,931
<i>When you touched me with your fire</i>

61
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:43,264
<i>You didn't know me then</i>

62
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:50,097
<i>I see you through the window of my soul</i>

63
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,681
<i>Maybe I don't know you</i>

64
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:05,556
"Bonomali, may you be Radha
in your next birth.

65
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:12,181
May you burn with the fire of longing.
Just as I do.

66
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:17,972
Bonomali, may you be Radha
in your next birth."

67
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:23,971
<i>Your voice changes and no one knows</i>

68
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:28,806
<i>How close we can come...</i>

69
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:34,097
<i>When you touched me with your fire</i>

70
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,972
<i>You didn't know me then</i>

71
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:45,264
<i>I see you through the window of my soul</i>

72
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:48,847
<i>Maybe I don't know you</i>

73
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:55,972
<i>The questions crowd around me
Demanding answers</i>

74
00:05:56,306 --> 00:06:00,972
<i>Where do I hide my feelings?</i>

75
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:06,639
<i>These strange rules of the universe</i>

76
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:12,431
<i>But the music plays on</i>

77
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:18,221
<i>These pages capture your sighs</i>

78
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:23,096
<i>Maybe you are still in this room</i>

79
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:28,181
<i>Clothes change
And no one knows...</i>

80
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:33,889
<i>The distances disappear</i>

81
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:39,471
<i>The pages hold the marks
of your heart</i>

82
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:44,638
<i>Maybe a different song plays this time</i>

83
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,389
<i>Voices change
And no one knows...</i>

84
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:55,264
<i>How close we can come</i>

85
00:06:55,472 --> 00:07:00,472
<i>When you touched me with your fire</i>

86
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:05,097
<i>You didn't know me then</i>

87
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:11,389
<i>I see you through the window of my soul</i>

88
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,639
<i>Maybe I don't know you</i>

89
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,889
The entire city is shocked
by this disturbing news.

90
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:34,514
The dead body of a man has been found
in an abandoned factory.

91
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:38,639
He's been murdered in a very well
planned way using kerosene to burn him.

92
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:42,472
According to the police,
he was burnt alive.

93
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:06,806
WIFE

94
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:26,847
<i>Hello?</i>

95
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:27,972
Yes, Malini. Tell me.

96
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:29,472
Mani!

97
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:31,597
Mani, there's a call for you.

98
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:33,847
<i>- Who is it?
- Joy.</i>

99
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,181
And please don't fight.

100
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:44,556
<i>Yes?</i>

101
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:47,181
I missed your call earlier.

102
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:49,347
I was in the bathroom.

103
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,681
Why lie, Dhananjoy?

104
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,514
After seven years of living with you,
I can tell when you're lying.

105
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:58,264
<i>Don't you know that?</i>

106
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,431
Why were you calling?

107
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,347
Wanted to remind you
of Gogol's birthday.

108
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:07,831
You know
what my problem is, Malini?

109
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,139
<i>I don't forget anything easily.</i>

110
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,347
That one criminal...

111
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,139
has ruined my life.

112
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:21,681
I've been chasing him
for the last five years.

113
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:24,014
And we've been chasing you.

114
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:25,764
Just for your time.

115
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:28,971
<i>Anyway... You be...</i>

116
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,389
happy with your life.

117
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,431
We'll make do.

118
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:36,806
I want to forget, Malini.

119
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,306
<i>I really want to forget.</i>

120
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,597
I've tried so many times...

121
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:44,389
to forget but...

122
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:48,055
every time I shut my eyes...

123
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:50,181
<i>Can I give you an advise,
Mr. Ex-police Officer?</i>

124
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,514
Try to forget us.

125
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,222
<i>That'll be the best for all of us.</i>

126
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,681
<i>Anyway...</i>

127
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,139
Set a reminder on your phone.

128
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:06,972
Otherwise, Gogol might think you
scored poorly at being a father.

129
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:23,555
<i>Police says the investigation
has started.</i>

130
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,222
<i>But there are too many questions
left unanswered.</i>

131
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,138
<i>The body has been identified.</i>

132
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,014
<i>The name of the victim is Shaon Basu.</i>

133
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:32,721
<i>He was the owner of a real estate business
in South Kolkata.</i>

134
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:36,056
<i>Recently, a suspicious fire was reported
at his office.</i>

135
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:40,931
<i>Police are trying to find a link
between the two incidents.</i>

136
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,721
<i>Dhananjoy Chatterjee might be...</i>

137
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,472
completely mad now.

138
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,681
But two years back he was the
best detective in the department.

139
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:06,222
He would be able to tell you everything
about this case.

140
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,181
Sir, I heard...

141
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:12,596
he couldn't catch the killer
although he tried very hard.

142
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:14,472
He had almost solved the case.

143
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,639
There was just one thing
he couldn't figure out.

144
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,889
Why were these people being murdered?

145
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,014
Was it at random?

146
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,389
Or was there a motive?

147
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:29,514
<i>Dhananjoy believed that this man is...</i>

148
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,347
<i>an ordinary, middle class, simple Bengali.</i>

149
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,763
<i>Someone who can disappear
in a crowd very easily.</i>

150
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:38,306
<i>He keeps a watch on his target
with the crowd as his cover.</i>

151
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,472
<i>He attacks his victim
when the time is right.</i>

152
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:49,431
<i>He would spot his prey.</i>

153
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:54,389
<i>Then he would delve deeper
into each aspect of the target's life.</i>

154
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,014
<i>His homework was thorough.</i>

155
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:05,555
<i>And after he was 100% sure
of the target...</i>

156
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:07,347
<i>he would prepare his weapons.</i>

157
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:11,806
Duct tape, pistol, hand cuff...
Whatever he needed.

158
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:18,222
<i>Then he would wait in the shadows
to hunt his prey.</i>

159
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:25,139
Rohit, careful.
The clock is ticking.

160
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:30,681
Who the hell...

161
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:35,556
Dhanonjoy said his biggest virtue
was patience.

162
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:39,347
<i>He would wait like a scorpion.</i>

163
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,681
<i>To sting at the last moment.</i>

164
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,681
Rohit?

165
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,139
<i>And then he would strike from behind.</i>

166
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,764
Your time is up.

167
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:04,389
<i>Sir?</i>

168
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:07,347
Can we get Dhanonjoy Chatterjee's help
in this case?

169
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:11,681
I'm sure he would be able to solve
this case with his eyes closed.

170
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,389
Have you read 'The Mahabharata'?

171
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:17,514
If Arjun, the warrior,
decides not to fight...

172
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,972
It's very difficult to bring him back
to the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

173
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,013
One butterscotch, please.

174
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:44,764
But he likes vanilla.

175
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:05,347
- Daddy!
- Gogol!

176
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,555
- Daddy!
- Gogol!

177
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:08,306
Wait, Gogol, wait!

178
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,346
- Daddy!
- Gogol!

179
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:10,347
- Gogol!
- Gogol!

180
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:15,264
- Are you hurt, Gogol?
- Gogol!

181
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:16,181
How can I get hurt?

182
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,263
I knew it.

183
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:19,722
You would rescue me like Superman.

184
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:21,181
That's enough, Gogol.

185
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:22,971
That car might have hit you.

186
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,413
Nothing would happen to him, Malini.

187
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,472
As long as I'm alive
nothing will happen to him.

188
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:30,388
You don't need to act like a hero
in front of your son, Dhanonjoy.

189
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:33,431
I left because I wanted him
to be away from you.

190
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:38,181
Let's go, Gogol.
We're late.

191
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,721
Your garnny is waiting for you.
She's made your favourite pancakes.

192
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,056
Pancakes?

193
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,847
Daddy, come with us.
You can have pancakes too.

194
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,139
No, kiddo.

195
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,597
Our home will be completely empty
if I leave.

196
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,514
- Go...
- Come on.

197
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:10,639
Sir.

198
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,638
We've been able to recover
very few evidence.

199
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,972
There's a Royal Bengal Club brochure.

200
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,431
Two books.

201
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,180
Rabindranath Tagore's
'Boat Wreck' and...

202
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:20,263
Manik Bandopadhyay's
'The Boatman of the Padma.'

203
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:21,889
A bubblegum wrapper...

204
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,889
We found the blood stained knife earlier.

205
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,264
And a torn shirt.

206
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:28,264
Other than the blood stained knife
we didn't find anything important.

207
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:31,931
You never seize to amaze me, Indra.

208
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,514
<i>Every thing is important.</i>

209
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,056
- All you need is an eye for details.
- Sir.

210
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,097
Useless!

211
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,139
Indra.

212
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:44,056
I can't say for sure...

213
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,514
but the pattern of the murder
is exactly the same.

214
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:48,847
Proshun.

215
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:50,764
Try to bring Dhanonjoy back.

216
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:53,306
What do you want?

217
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:55,889
Umm?

218
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,014
Listen.

219
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:04,347
Even if Lord Krishna recites from
'The Gita' I'm not going back.

220
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:09,639
Sir, that's the only unsolved case
of your career.

221
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:13,472
You've tried so hard to catch the murderer.

222
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,889
Sir, don't you want the murderer...

223
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,556
What?

224
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,514
Do we get everything we want?

225
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:37,514
There's gap between wanting and getting
that needs to be fulfilled.

226
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:41,722
Sir, I am a huge fan of yours.

227
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:45,972
If anyone can solve this case,
it's only you.

228
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,306
Please don't flatter me.

229
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,472
It doesn't go well with our jobs.

230
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,722
Sir, any suggestions?

231
00:16:57,056 --> 00:17:00,014
Actually, we're completely out
of our depths.

232
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:05,514
When the murderer has returned...

233
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:08,639
he'll come back in style.

234
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:11,806
This is his first episode.

235
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,847
There are going to be more episodes.

236
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:18,514
Be prepared.

237
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,097
Out!

238
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:36,139
A letter for you, sir.

239
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,056
Keep it on the table.
I'll check later.

240
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:40,597
It came by speed post.

241
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:43,513
It says urgent.

242
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:44,514
Let's see.

243
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:45,764
Thank you.

244
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,014
<i>Dear friend,</i>

245
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,681
<i>The way you're drowning in alcohol...</i>

246
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:03,181
<i>I'm sure you won't feel
like reading my letter.</i>

247
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:07,056
<i>That's why I'm sending the letter
to your senior colleague, Mr. Karmakar.</i>

248
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:12,472
<i>I'm hoping he'll deliver my letter to you
on time.</i>

249
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,347
<i>I'm writing to you.</i>

250
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,221
<i>Because this time too,
like all other times...</i>

251
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:20,056
<i>your ex-colleagues will fail
at the investigation.</i>

252
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,889
<i>They'll make a fool of themselves.</i>

253
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:23,764
<i>I'm an ordinary man.</i>

254
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:26,264
<i>That's why I don't trust the police at all.</i>

255
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:29,847
<i>I remember that day clearly.</i>

256
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:33,597
<i>The day we almost met.</i>

257
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,722
<i>I felt very proud for you.</i>

258
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:39,139
<i>You had a powerful energy.</i>

259
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:56,972
Your Math hasn't improved, Karmakar.

260
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,556
You're not counting the dead body
sitting right in front of you.

261
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,639
He has...

262
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:08,889
murdered me a long time ago.

263
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:12,347
Maybe.

264
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:15,681
I'm growing old.

265
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,764
Maybe, that's why my calculations
are a little off.

266
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,806
But I can still read the clock.

267
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,306
And guess what the clock says?

268
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:29,847
He wants to finish off the game.

269
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:33,097
He is directly challenging you.

270
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:38,347
<i>I want to tell you a lot of things.</i>

271
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,139
<i>Because I believe...</i>

272
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:43,681
<i>one day you'll tell my story
to the entire world.</i>

273
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,514
<i>Only a friend shares
this kind of understanding.</i>

274
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:49,806
<i>And I want the world to know my story.</i>

275
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:53,931
<i>I haven't found a better messenger
than you.</i>

276
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:58,097
<i>Nothing has been acheived
by trusting the law of this country.</i>

277
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,056
<i>That's why I am depending on you.</i>

278
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:02,139
<i>You love poetry.</i>

279
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,597
<i>Sending you a poem I wrote.</i>

280
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:11,264
"The ones you're too scared to name
Will eat your body out

281
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,889
And your mind will be eaten
by doubt."

282
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:16,722
"Think about it".

283
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:20,347
<i>"I know you appreciate good literature."</i>

284
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:23,180
<i>"Happy new year. 20..."</i>

285
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,306
"Twenty five".

286
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,347
"With love.
Your dear friend."

287
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:38,597
Twenty twenty five.

288
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,556
Why 2025?

289
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:54,472
<i>My sails flutter in your untamed breeze...</i>

290
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:01,639
Hey! You can't give up already.

291
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,972
Please don't hurt me.

292
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,972
- Please forgive me.
- No, that's not possible.

293
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:09,805
Forgiving you means letting you live.

294
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:11,638
You don't even have a spine.

295
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,347
What's the point of staying alive?

296
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:21,347
You are more of a pimp
than an insurance agent.

297
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:22,722
What happened?

298
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:25,931
Why are you shivering?

299
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:29,514
Your hands don't shiver
when you take bribes.

300
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:32,097
When you beat your wife...

301
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,199
you're hands didn't shiver then either.

302
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:36,014
So, why is it happening now?

303
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,930
You find joy in hurting
and insulting other people, don't you?

304
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:45,556
I just had a thought.

305
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,180
You look like a puppet now.

306
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:51,472
And I control the strings.

307
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:59,806
<i>My sail flutters in your untamed breeze...</i>

308
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,514
What? What's this?

309
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,306
Why are you scared?

310
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,430
Isn't this a familiar place for you?

311
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,764
This is where you bring other women
behind your wife's back.

312
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:19,639
This is where you made the secret deals
with your clients.

313
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:22,305
They would give you loads of cash.

314
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:25,514
You'd carry on with the corruption
without any worry.

315
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,931
What's wrong?

316
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,764
What's happening?

317
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:33,681
The thought of women
usually make you drool.

318
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:36,556
How come your throat is drying up
so easily?

319
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:39,264
I should have offered
you some water, right?

320
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:47,681
<i>I'm ready to drown...</i>

321
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:51,347
I've always had a very deep connection
with water.

322
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,263
I was a great swimmer.

323
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:56,138
Sometimes I felt like a sailboat.

324
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:57,888
Sometimes a swan.

325
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:00,097
And sometimes I felt like a warship.

326
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,764
But that's all water
under the bridge now.

327
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:09,681
Whenever I see a disgusting man
like you...

328
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,639
I'm washed over by a wave of violence.
It's like a tsunami.

329
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,930
Actually, Rohit, the thing is...

330
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:17,971
everyone is judged by Time.

331
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:19,514
No one can get away from it.

332
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,139
Except for the judge himself.

333
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:26,597
I love playing the judge.

334
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:28,556
Yes.

335
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:38,472
I was just joking... just joking.

336
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:41,763
Doesn't it feel
like the ebb and flow.

337
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:45,555
Sometimes you're high and I'm low.
And then I'm high and you're low.

338
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:48,014
Okay, let's do something.

339
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:50,013
Let's see which way the river flows.

340
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:51,264
Take this.

341
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,388
You can beat me with this.

342
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:55,972
Come on... Take it.

343
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:57,847
What's wrong?

344
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:02,680
I'm a very good boy.
I gave you your favourite weapon.

345
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:05,639
This is the hand you take bribes with...
beat your wife with...

346
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:09,014
But your hands are tied.

347
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,972
No problem. I'll do it.

348
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:15,806
The atonement for your sins...

349
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:19,306
You can't stop now.

350
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:20,889
The game has just begun.

351
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:29,556
Five murders.

352
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,472
And yet he didn't leave behind any clues.

353
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:36,847
Every time the forensics are messed up.

354
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:40,264
Five murders in five years.

355
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:44,680
Although, in just a few days,
there are going to be two murders.

356
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:45,764
Why?

357
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:49,639
He has increased his strike rate.

358
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,556
Which means he is in a rush.

359
00:24:54,097 --> 00:24:55,347
But why?

360
00:24:56,222 --> 00:25:01,305
Sir, you said the first murder was like
the last murder from five years ago.

361
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:04,930
Shaon Basu too was burnt alive.

362
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:09,430
This serial killer should be called
Mr. Five Elements.

363
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:16,681
All his crimes revolve around the five
basic elements mentioned in 'The Rigveda'.

364
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:19,681
The five elements...

365
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:25,514
Dhanonjoy, correct me if I'm wrong.

366
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:27,888
The five elements.

367
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:30,096
The five most important elements.

368
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:33,889
Everything in this universe
was created with these five elements.

369
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:35,972
And they are...

370
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:39,764
The elements are...

371
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:43,847
Fire.

372
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:48,847
Water.

373
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:53,472
Air.

374
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,681
Sky.

375
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,639
And...

376
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:03,097
Earth.

377
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,847
This man is probably a monk.

378
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,514
He might be a copycat too.

379
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:14,180
Maybe, he's copying the patterns
of the earlier murders.

380
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,138
Yes, for that...

381
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:20,555
you'll have to check if he has left
some signs on the crime scene.

382
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:23,096
I mean any kind of signature.

383
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:24,763
Correct. Correct!

384
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:27,181
All we need to do is
look for these symbols.

385
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:35,306
He killed five people in cold blood
over five years.

386
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:39,097
Do you think he'll act so rashly?

387
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:43,556
Come on... Time to wake up.

388
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:47,889
"I'm ready to drown..."

389
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:51,722
"I am ready to drown."

390
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:03,889
I'll have to leave
for my son's birthday now.

391
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,471
We're leaving the evidence box here.

392
00:27:05,472 --> 00:27:06,805
If you think of something...

393
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:09,181
Where did I leave my motorbike keys?

394
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:14,431
Dhanonjoy you're drunk.
I'll book a cab for you.

395
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:22,722
Thank you, sir.

396
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:27,389
Cab is booked.

397
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:32,389
Dhanonjoy, we can't solve this case
without you.

398
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:35,597
My job is on the line.

399
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:37,347
Sir...

400
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:42,097
If you walk around the fire seven times
during the wedding rituals...

401
00:27:42,222 --> 00:27:45,181
how many lives is the relationship
supposed to last?

402
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:49,931
- Seven.
- Seven.

403
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:52,055
- Seven.
- Seven.

404
00:27:52,056 --> 00:27:56,805
That man has taken away everything from me
in this life.

405
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:59,805
Even if that man is hanged
seven times over...

406
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:02,263
my son's birthdays
are not going to come back.

407
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,972
I hope you understand that.

408
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:05,222
Hmm...

409
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:09,097
Yeah...

410
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,014
Thank you.

411
00:28:16,556 --> 00:28:17,806
Your cab is here.

412
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:25,347
Sir, need your blessing to move ahead
in this investigation.

413
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:28,597
Happy new year.

414
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:33,014
Dhanonjoy, today is 30th December.

415
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:37,264
"Happy new year" is day after tomorrow.

416
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:40,806
Just for your information. Bye.

417
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:48,556
Sir, the letter he has sent me...

418
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:53,431
it says "happy new year,
twenty, twenty five."

419
00:28:55,056 --> 00:29:00,971
If it was according to the English calendar
it would have been 2019.

420
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:08,139
And according to the Bengali calendar
it would be 1425.

421
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:11,347
If you take a closer look at the letter...

422
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:14,264
There's a colon between
twenty and twenty five.

423
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,472
Check it... Just...

424
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,181
Sir...

425
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,681
What does this mean?

426
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:35,222
"Happy new year" is first of January.

427
00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:38,764
And 20:25 is the time.

428
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:43,471
8:25 p.m. according to military time.

429
00:29:43,472 --> 00:29:47,097
First January, 8:25 p.m.

430
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:48,764
Happy new year, sir.

431
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:54,472
<i>Granny...</i>

432
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:57,056
Has Daddy forgotten my birthday?

433
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:59,472
Not at all.

434
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:02,847
He's probably stuck
in some important work.

435
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:07,513
I know Daddy is trying to catch a bad man.

436
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,722
So that he can save a lot of people.

437
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:13,389
Keep this.

438
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,722
Please give it to Daddy.

439
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:30,681
Absolutely.

440
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:33,847
- Now please try to sleep.
- Good night, Granny.

441
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:47,681
Mom is putting Gogol to sleep.

442
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:53,222
Please let me see Gogol at least once.

443
00:30:53,514 --> 00:30:55,431
I know I'm late.

444
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:57,431
Karmakar had come home.

445
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,597
It was about the case... That's why...

446
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:03,556
So, you've invited people from work
to fill up the empty house?

447
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,472
The murderer has sent me a letter, Malini.

448
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:09,846
Evidence...

449
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,972
I had to answer a few questions.

450
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,639
Just a formality.

451
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:16,597
I've said no to them.

452
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:20,722
You obviously don't have the word
responsibility in your dictionary.

453
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:24,597
A little boy expects his dad beside him
when he cuts his birthday cake.

454
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:28,221
You've missed his birthday before too...

455
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:31,096
I've begged your forgiveness
for that night many times.

456
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,806
Only for that one night?

457
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:35,055
Birthdays, parent-teacher meetings,
sports days...

458
00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:37,056
You've always been an absent father.

459
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:40,014
Your apologies won't bring back
the happiness lost.

460
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:42,389
That's why...

461
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:45,097
I don't wear the police badge anymore.

462
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:49,014
For you, for Gogol, for us...

463
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,514
Don't you think I'm trying?

464
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:58,222
Gogol's class teacher wanted to know if
you'll attend the parent-teacher's meeting.

465
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:00,764
I've told him, you're unwell.

466
00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:03,180
Making excuses for you
has become a habit.

467
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:05,971
I'll be there...

468
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:07,722
For the parent-teacher's meeting.

469
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:10,681
Please let me meet Gogol just once.

470
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,222
Please, Malini.

471
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,889
You'll spend two minutes with him
then go home and drink agan.

472
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:17,139
Gogol won't have you around.

473
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:19,764
He fell asleep crying.

474
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,972
It won't be possible
to wake him up now.

475
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:26,055
- You should leave now.
- Malini... Malini...

476
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,847
Just once, Malini.

477
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:29,014
Malini...

478
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:53,181
<i>A late night flight</i>

479
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:57,680
<i>A song that doesn't let you sleep</i>

480
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:05,681
<i>Keeps playing in my head</i>

481
00:33:06,764 --> 00:33:11,389
<i>I reach out in emptiness</i>

482
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:15,846
<i>I run through the ashes</i>

483
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:20,305
<i>At the call of the falling leaves</i>

484
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:24,931
<i>Is that why I'm homeless?</i>

485
00:33:25,514 --> 00:33:29,806
<i>Where should I go now?</i>

486
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:34,471
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

487
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:38,931
<i>Where should I go now?</i>

488
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:42,721
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

489
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:47,181
<i>Has he changed his address?</i>

490
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:51,764
<i>No one stares out of the window</i>

491
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:56,263
<i>The sky keeps getting darker</i>

492
00:33:56,264 --> 00:34:04,264
<i>With the depressing chimney smoke</i>

493
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:12,930
Where's the inhaler?

494
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:16,139
- Daddy...
- I'll call him.

495
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:23,555
I can't talk right now.
I'm busy.

496
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:26,014
Please get an inhaler
and come home quickly.

497
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,660
Gogol is having another asthma attack.

498
00:34:28,222 --> 00:34:30,305
A person's life is at risk.

499
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:31,139
<i>I can't get it right now.</i>

500
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,763
What about your son?
Come home now.

501
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:36,930
A boy is about to get killed.
At least you're there with Gogol.

502
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:38,138
This boy is also someone'schild.

503
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,181
Do whatever you want.

504
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:48,972
It burns!

505
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,139
Help me... Save me...

506
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:06,181
I'm burning...

507
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:24,847
<i>This sunburnt country</i>

508
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:29,431
<i>Finally have I arrived</i>

509
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:37,889
<i>I've found the eye of the hurricane</i>

510
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:43,263
<i>I walk very slowly</i>

511
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:47,347
<i>So that the earth doesn't shudder</i>

512
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:55,847
<i>But I turned blind
when I opened my eyes</i>

513
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:02,014
<i>Where should I go now?</i>

514
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:06,680
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

515
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:11,139
<i>Where should I go now?</i>

516
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:14,930
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

517
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:19,388
<i>Has he changed his address?</i>

518
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:23,971
<i>No one stares out of the window</i>

519
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:28,471
<i>The sky keeps getting darker</i>

520
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:36,472
<i>With the depressing chimney smoke</i>

521
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:03,347
Wasn't expecting you.

522
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,889
I couldn't help myself.

523
00:37:07,347 --> 00:37:09,431
Please go back to your work.

524
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:11,014
Take up the case.

525
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:13,472
Catch the culprit.

526
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,763
I've no idea what you're talking about.

527
00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:20,347
If you can catch the guy
you'll find peace.

528
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:23,472
And I'll get my family back.

529
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:28,514
You know that, chasing that guy...

530
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:30,930
made me lose everything in life.

531
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:32,806
Why don't you get it?

532
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:35,805
If you're the one who cuffs the culprit...

533
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:38,222
you'll get your entire life back.

534
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:41,139
No...

535
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:43,972
Please excuse me.
I can't do it.

536
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,431
Gogol sent this for you.

537
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:54,097
He made this in his drawing class.

538
00:37:57,014 --> 00:38:02,806
May be for you or my daughter,
you're a defeated man.

539
00:38:02,972 --> 00:38:06,055
But for my grandson,
you're Superman.

540
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:07,888
Now, you decide...

541
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:10,638
will you remain a defeated man?

542
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,847
Or do you want to be
your son's Superman?

543
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,306
It's completely your decision.

544
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:20,847
THE BOATMAN OF PADMA

545
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:23,681
THE BOAT WRECK

546
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:47,306
You can ask me what's in those files.
I know them by heart.

547
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,056
Karmakar, I've realised
life is the greatest rehab.

548
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,681
I want to start living again.

549
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:02,014
And there's only person
who can keep me alive.

550
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:05,139
That murderer.

551
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:11,389
Welcome back.

552
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:15,222
Thank you, sir.

553
00:41:21,764 --> 00:41:24,181
The five elements.

554
00:41:28,472 --> 00:41:30,097
He's back.

555
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:06,388
<i>The body you found here
belongs to a man named Shaon Basu.</i>

556
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:07,014
P133_BP_Sh025E

557
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:11,014
<i>He set his own office on fire
to get the insurance money.</i>

558
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:13,472
<i>Many people were killed.</i>

559
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:16,389
<i>So, if this man didn't burn to ashes...</i>

560
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,806
<i>who knows, there could have been
more fires in the future.</i>

561
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:23,347
<i>More innocent people would have died.</i>

562
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:42,097
<i>In the city of mirrors
near my home</i>

563
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:49,056
<i>My neighbour lives there...</i>

564
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:57,264
<i>Who I just saw.</i>

565
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:58,389
My friend...

566
00:42:58,764 --> 00:43:00,722
<i>how are you?</i>

567
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:02,472
Who is this?

568
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:05,764
Your neighbour
from the "city of mirrors".

569
00:43:06,472 --> 00:43:08,514
<i>You chased me for seven years.</i>

570
00:43:08,681 --> 00:43:10,514
But you couldn't save the day.

571
00:43:11,014 --> 00:43:14,847
I used to think you are smart.
But now I see that you are foolish.

572
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:17,389
<i>Don't think that you're God...</i>

573
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:20,430
And don't sing the last line
of that song, please.

574
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,631
<i>Why don't you think it's over?</i>

575
00:43:21,972 --> 00:43:23,680
Oh, you want to play some more?

576
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:26,764
Extra time, tie-breaker
and then you'll win at the last moment.

577
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:28,430
There's no end.

578
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:32,264
And the end you have in mind
is going to change the game for you.

579
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:35,681
My game is going to change later.

580
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,764
But first you must change yourself.

581
00:43:39,556 --> 00:43:42,680
How much longer are you going to be
like a cheated lover...

582
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:46,222
<i>celebrating your defeat
drowning your sorrows in alcohol?</i>

583
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,222
I have an advice for you.

584
00:43:48,264 --> 00:43:50,639
Don't dismiss it because it's free.

585
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:52,889
Since you're trying to defeat me...

586
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:55,722
<i>you have to become like me.</i>

587
00:43:55,972 --> 00:43:59,389
Otherwise, there'll be a few more
pointless corpses in Kolkata.

588
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:03,097
And you'll try to solve the puzzle
without any success.

589
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,097
But it won't work.

590
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:05,596
<i>The last scene of the film...</i>

591
00:44:05,597 --> 00:44:06,597
and the last page of the book...

592
00:44:06,598 --> 00:44:08,556
should never be seen first.

593
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,972
It ruins the story.

594
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:13,972
<i>You think you're writing the story.</i>

595
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:17,431
But I'm changing the plot of this story
very slowly.

596
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:19,014
And you don't even have a clue.

597
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:23,389
Bravo! Bravo!

598
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:26,514
I love the fact
that you're so relentless.

599
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:29,681
<i>Now do you understand
why I chose you?</i>

600
00:44:31,056 --> 00:44:34,222
Some days I wake up and ask,
why?

601
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,681
I can just end it here.

602
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:39,806
But then I shut my eyes
and think of you.

603
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:43,347
<i>That face in distress...</i>

604
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,097
<i>Your wife and kid have left you...</i>

605
00:44:46,306 --> 00:44:49,222
The agony of not being able to catch me...

606
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:52,930
But an invincible force drives you ahead...

607
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:54,513
Pushing you through...

608
00:44:54,514 --> 00:44:57,264
You've entered the arena again
to defeat me...

609
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:58,806
I know you can do it...

610
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:03,347
I thought if you searched
for a famous person on Google...

611
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,306
<i>you find out everything.</i>

612
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,222
But I'm not a famous person.

613
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:09,930
How did you know
so much about me?

614
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,388
I didn't have to look you up on Google.

615
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:15,014
I was checking my compatibility
with the police.

616
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:16,722
<i>I found you.</i>

617
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,722
<i>We're very similar, you know.</i>

618
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:21,597
We're both seekers of truth, my friend.

619
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,039
We're both in pursuit of the truth.

620
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,846
<i>I'm trying to find the truth
in the five elements.</i>

621
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:28,248
<i>And you're trying to find my truth.</i>

622
00:45:29,597 --> 00:45:30,722
There's one difference.

623
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:34,389
I'm running alone and you've become alone
because of the chase.

624
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:36,221
Both of us are very lonely.

625
00:45:36,222 --> 00:45:37,931
<i>Is that why you need a play mate?</i>

626
00:45:39,722 --> 00:45:41,681
That's where you've gone wrong.

627
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:44,639
I'm not here to play with you.
I've come to stop you.

628
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:47,346
<i>Now let's get to the point...</i>

629
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:49,181
shall we, "friend"?

630
00:45:49,556 --> 00:45:52,889
<i>We found a cup's print
on the Royal Bengal Club brochure.</i>

631
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:57,930
You've highlighted that on purpose. Right?

632
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:58,931
<i>Bravo!</i>

633
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:03,556
Now do you see why we're friends.

634
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,305
You got it.

635
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:08,806
<i>Your deductions give me goosebumps.</i>

636
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:13,889
Makes me feel, life is beautiful!

637
00:46:14,264 --> 00:46:16,639
<i>Do you want to live beautifully?</i>

638
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:19,722
You still have time.

639
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:22,097
Where is the man you kidnapped?

640
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,347
<i>Is he alive
or have you killed him?</i>

641
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:26,014
<i>A gap of two years.</i>

642
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,388
Why have you come back?

643
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:29,306
<i>The questions are easy.</i>

644
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:31,306
And you know the answers.

645
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:33,001
It's been seven years, my friend.

646
00:46:33,222 --> 00:46:34,805
<i>You need to hurry up now.</i>

647
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:37,097
<i>Or else, someone will be killed every day.</i>

648
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:39,889
Sadly, we don't have much time.

649
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:41,264
You know that already.

650
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:42,763
<i>"Time flows on</i>

651
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:44,056
<i>Like the currents of the river.</i>

652
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:47,139
<i>The one who doesn't understand
Woe be on him."</i>

653
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:49,847
Best wishes for you.
We'll talk later.

654
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:55,889
"Time flows on..."

655
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:08,556
Happy new year, 20:25.

656
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,764
Tomorrow evening...

657
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:14,222
"Time flows on" meaning time.

658
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:17,556
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

659
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,472
Heartbeat.

660
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,264
Meaning...

661
00:47:23,722 --> 00:47:25,889
the next victim is...

662
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:27,889
still alive not dead.

663
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,306
But not for too long.

664
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:33,889
Tomorrow 8:25 p.m.

665
00:47:34,222 --> 00:47:36,306
His time will be up.

666
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:54,556
The mark on the Royal
Bengal Club brochure...

667
00:47:56,056 --> 00:48:01,430
indicates the year, 1827.

668
00:48:01,431 --> 00:48:03,138
What about the books, sir?

669
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:04,779
The professor couldn't decipher anything.

670
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:07,513
"The Boatman of Padma"
and "The Boat-wreck."

671
00:48:07,514 --> 00:48:09,556
What's the connection?

672
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:13,097
- Boat.
- No.

673
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:14,681
No?

674
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:16,972
River?

675
00:48:17,514 --> 00:48:19,389
River! That means water!

676
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:22,181
Yes! Yes, simple!

677
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:26,431
The second element, water. Right?

678
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:31,889
Correct. That means
the next crime will be committed on water.

679
00:48:32,931 --> 00:48:36,014
Right before he hung up,
he said...

680
00:48:36,097 --> 00:48:40,264
"Time flows on
Like the currents of the river."

681
00:48:40,514 --> 00:48:42,013
- Indra?
- Sir!

682
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:44,138
What's the first river you can think of?

683
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:45,597
The Ganges.

684
00:48:47,347 --> 00:48:49,846
Maybe, the victim is somewhere around
the Ganges.

685
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:51,472
Brilliant!

686
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:55,139
Brilliant! But where?

687
00:48:56,306 --> 00:48:59,638
Proshun, give me the letter he sent me.

688
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:00,806
Yes, sir!

689
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,764
<i>Here!</i>

690
00:49:09,097 --> 00:49:14,180
"The ones you're too scared to name
Will eat your body out

691
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:16,972
And your mind will be eaten
by doubt."

692
00:49:25,014 --> 00:49:30,305
<i>"The ones you're too scared to name
Will eat your body out</i>

693
00:49:30,306 --> 00:49:32,847
<i>And your mind will be eaten
by doubt."</i>

694
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:37,680
<i>"The ones you're too scared to name
Will eat your body out</i>

695
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:44,389
<i>And your mind will be eaten
by doubt."</i>

696
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:55,971
During the Kali festival, the
"Aghori" monks visit the crematorium.

697
00:49:55,972 --> 00:49:58,680
And people believe
they should not be named.

698
00:49:58,681 --> 00:50:02,389
And these monks eat human flesh.

699
00:50:04,722 --> 00:50:06,346
"The ones you're too scared to name

700
00:50:06,347 --> 00:50:08,389
<i>Will eat your body out</i>

701
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:10,888
"Aghori" monks?

702
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:13,014
But what's the location, sir?

703
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:15,889
Except for Rabindranath Tagore
and Manik Bandopadhyay...

704
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:19,181
has no other author written anything
on rivers or water?

705
00:50:19,264 --> 00:50:20,639
- Why?
- Why?

706
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:23,055
Both were cremated
at the Nimtala crematorium.

707
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:25,931
And Nimtala crematorium
was built in 1827.

708
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:27,763
Amazing!

709
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:30,556
And that's where the "Aghori" monks go.

710
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,305
That means the victim has been kidnapped
and kept hidden in Nimtala crematorium.

711
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:36,596
Indra, call the ambulance.

712
00:50:36,597 --> 00:50:38,263
- Ask them to go to Nimatala.
- Right, sir.

713
00:50:38,264 --> 00:50:39,513
- Ask the force to get ready.
- Yes, sir.

714
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:41,806
We'll move right now.
Come. Let's go.

715
00:50:42,097 --> 00:50:43,931
Come on, guys. Move.

716
00:50:44,681 --> 00:50:49,431
There's just one piece of the puzzle
that I can't figure out.

717
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:51,305
<i>"Our little river...</i>

718
00:50:51,306 --> 00:50:53,221
meanders through...

719
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:55,931
The summer heat dries it
to a tiny stream.

720
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:58,389
Cattles cross over, so does..."

721
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,722
I've been reciting this rhyme
since I was a kid.

722
00:51:01,764 --> 00:51:04,888
But I've never wondered how much
water there might be during winter.

723
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,431
Do you know?

724
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:07,555
Anyway...

725
00:51:07,556 --> 00:51:10,639
"Cattles can cross over,
so does the cart.

726
00:51:10,722 --> 00:51:13,264
The banks are high
and the her depth is shallow."

727
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:16,722
<i>Dhananjoy, I think you should take it up
from here.</i>

728
00:51:17,097 --> 00:51:18,639
You should lead us.

729
00:51:19,097 --> 00:51:21,139
We'll follow your instructions.

730
00:51:21,472 --> 00:51:22,472
Sir?

731
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:24,931
Make one thing very clear in your head.

732
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:28,389
The guy we're going against
is like a cobra.

733
00:51:29,097 --> 00:51:32,055
He can come out of any hole
at any time and attack.

734
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:35,847
Although, very soon your life
will be out of balance.

735
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:38,181
But have you noticed
the poem's rhyming scheme?

736
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,556
Tagore goes on to write...

737
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:44,347
Why are you crying?

738
00:51:47,722 --> 00:51:49,056
Don't cry.

739
00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:51,847
What's the next line?
Do you remember?

740
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:56,597
You don't remember.

741
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:01,931
Bengalis! "The sand glitters.

742
00:52:02,472 --> 00:52:04,389
No mud to be found.

743
00:52:04,764 --> 00:52:07,472
The far banks are lit up
by the white 'Kans' grass."

744
00:52:07,972 --> 00:52:10,889
If he was going to drown the victim,
he wouldn't tell us the time.

745
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:14,639
We're playing chess on a board
that he has created.

746
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:18,514
He can change the game up
any moment.

747
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,847
Look at you still crying.

748
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,222
This is the beauty of poetry.

749
00:52:24,264 --> 00:52:27,222
It can make a culprit like you cry.

750
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:31,721
Please forgive me.

751
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:33,806
Please have mercy.

752
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:36,431
Forgiveness is out of the question.

753
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:41,764
I've heard, all your sins
can be washed away with water.

754
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:44,472
Wipe away your tears.

755
00:52:44,514 --> 00:52:46,639
Let me see.

756
00:52:49,931 --> 00:52:52,514
Let's test it then.
Virtue and sin.

757
00:52:53,222 --> 00:52:54,806
"Boom" bubblegum.

758
00:52:58,431 --> 00:52:59,764
Boom...

759
00:52:59,889 --> 00:53:01,431
Bomb...

760
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:07,388
"Time flows on..."

761
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:08,597
Time.

762
00:53:09,222 --> 00:53:10,431
Time bomb?

763
00:53:12,264 --> 00:53:14,763
"Time flows on
Like the currents of the river".

764
00:53:14,764 --> 00:53:16,389
- No, no...
- Shut up!

765
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:17,931
Not one word!

766
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:21,931
Your time is almost up.

767
00:53:22,389 --> 00:53:23,931
I'll take your leave now.

768
00:53:27,014 --> 00:53:30,181
"The one who doesn't understand
Woe be upon them."

769
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:32,931
No! No!

770
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:53,931
Help me!

771
00:53:58,056 --> 00:54:01,972
Help! Help! Help!

772
00:54:02,014 --> 00:54:04,181
- Dhanonjoy!
- Help me!

773
00:54:04,431 --> 00:54:06,888
Please help me!

774
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:09,305
- Dhanonjoy! Come back!
- Help!

775
00:54:09,306 --> 00:54:14,888
Help me! Help me, please!

776
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:15,222
P133_BP_Sh044A

777
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:16,306
NIMTALA CREMATORIUM

778
00:54:20,347 --> 00:54:23,181
A flock of birds chirp and play.

779
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:26,889
And foxes howl at night."

780
00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:38,597
Save me! Save me! Save me!

781
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:52,639
Help!

782
00:54:56,181 --> 00:54:57,181
Boom!

783
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:22,139
Dhananjay!

784
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:35,847
Dhanonjoy, don't feel sorry.

785
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:38,264
You could have saved him.

786
00:55:39,264 --> 00:55:40,847
If you had a little more time.

787
00:55:41,222 --> 00:55:42,306
You could have...

788
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,639
If we can't find out what happened
in that man's life seven years ago...

789
00:55:45,764 --> 00:55:47,556
we'll never be able to solve this case.

790
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:23,430
Indra, I'm busy.
I'll talk to you later.

791
00:57:23,431 --> 00:57:24,638
Sir, it's very urgent.

792
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:26,639
I'm at the Nimtala crematorium
like you asked.

793
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:27,806
I've found a bag here.

794
00:57:28,014 --> 00:57:29,597
I'm at my son's school now.

795
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:31,847
Sir, please hear me out.

796
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,139
I've found a dictaphone.

797
00:57:33,306 --> 00:57:34,555
You have to listen to this.

798
00:57:34,556 --> 00:57:36,597
<i>This man's name is Rohit Biswas.</i>

799
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:39,264
<i>He would have killed his wife
if he wasn't stopped.</i>

800
00:57:40,097 --> 00:57:42,597
<i>Just like his wife was
drowning in his rage...</i>

801
00:57:42,931 --> 00:57:45,597
<i>the holy waters of Ganges
consumed his sins.</i>

802
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:48,181
<i>This is poetic justice,
isn't it, my friend?</i>

803
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:50,472
What else was there in the bag?

804
00:57:50,597 --> 00:57:53,763
A calculator with the number
17672...

805
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:55,472
<i>1790.</i>

806
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,764
And a piece of white cloth
with three blue stripes on it.

807
00:58:00,514 --> 00:58:01,514
What about the symbol?

808
00:58:01,556 --> 00:58:03,639
Sir, the symbol is a...

809
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,056
pentagram of the five elements.

810
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:08,347
What does this mean?

811
00:58:08,472 --> 00:58:11,472
This means we've got the location
of the next victim's murder.

812
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:15,722
There's going to be another murder
in a few days.

813
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:19,347
<i>Usually, he's not late...</i>

814
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,056
There he is.

815
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:25,056
This is Gogol's class teacher,
Mr. Bhattacharya.

816
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:27,972
My husband, Dhanonjoy Chatterjee.

817
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:29,721
- Hello!
- Hello!

818
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:31,764
Finally, we meet.

819
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:35,722
Gogol enjoys his studies.

820
00:58:35,806 --> 00:58:37,806
But he loves drawing the most.

821
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,889
He can spend hours with his crayons.

822
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:43,264
That's why children are like magic.

823
00:58:43,306 --> 00:58:45,930
In this gray canvas of life..

824
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:48,431
They paint their joyful rainbows.

825
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:51,597
Grown-ups, at the most...

826
00:58:51,764 --> 00:58:53,263
paint their own lives.

827
00:58:53,264 --> 00:58:54,347
Phone.

828
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,888
It's a call from the office.
It's urgent.

829
00:58:57,889 --> 00:58:59,305
Can't you take it later?

830
00:58:59,306 --> 00:59:01,222
You just got to the meeting.
Stay for a bit.

831
00:59:01,306 --> 00:59:02,971
Is there a problem?

832
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:07,139
No, actually... I'll have to leave.

833
00:59:07,222 --> 00:59:09,597
Daddy, please don't go.

834
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:14,180
- Sorry, sir.
- Don't worry.

835
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:16,013
Nothing to worry about.

836
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:19,139
How will you learn new things
if you don't make mistakes?

837
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,639
Adults make mistakes all the time.

838
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:25,264
But everyone deserves a second chance.

839
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:26,847
Gogol, let's do something.

840
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:32,014
- How about we start fresh tomorrow?
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

841
00:59:33,472 --> 00:59:34,847
Excuse me.

842
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:46,888
Sorry...

843
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:51,097
We're very thankful for the way
you're teaching Gogol.

844
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,138
Yes, you're his favourite teacher.

845
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:55,971
Gogol is my favourite student...
Absolute favourite.

846
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,139
- I'll walk you out.
- Okay.

847
01:00:04,972 --> 01:00:08,056
- We'll meet again.
- Of course.

848
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:29,347
- Hello, sir!
- Take a seat.

849
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:31,056
Sir.

850
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:34,013
Ask forensics to process
the fingerprints quickly.

851
01:00:34,014 --> 01:00:35,139
Okay, sir.

852
01:00:35,222 --> 01:00:36,888
Sir, if he makes one mistake...

853
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:38,680
then the case will be thrown open to us.

854
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:41,556
And we'll have to wait
for that moment.

855
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:42,931
And by the way...

856
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:44,846
the phone he'd called from...

857
01:00:44,847 --> 01:00:46,138
Have you traced it?

858
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:47,764
It was a fake SIM card, sir.

859
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:53,139
We can't let him kill one more person.

860
01:00:53,264 --> 01:00:55,056
But there's one thing
I can't figure out...

861
01:00:55,472 --> 01:00:57,347
He killed five people first.

862
01:00:57,389 --> 01:00:59,763
He waited quietly for two years.

863
01:00:59,764 --> 01:01:01,597
Then, two more murders.

864
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:04,097
Shaon Basu and Rohit Biswas.

865
01:01:04,389 --> 01:01:07,431
Are you sure there's no connection
between these seven people?

866
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:10,055
Indra, check the evidence thoroughly.

867
01:01:10,056 --> 01:01:11,056
Sir!

868
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:14,972
Maybe, the clue is right in front of us
and we can't see it.

869
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,681
Sir, forensic lab called
after checking the mud sample.

870
01:01:46,806 --> 01:01:48,597
There's human DNA in the mud.

871
01:01:49,222 --> 01:01:52,347
What is he trying to say?

872
01:01:52,806 --> 01:01:54,096
What does he want?
Revenge?

873
01:01:54,097 --> 01:01:56,430
Why is he calling you now
after two years?

874
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:58,722
I'm sure there's some reason
behind it, Karmakar.

875
01:01:58,806 --> 01:02:02,556
I don't want to play his game
but he is forcing me to face him in battle.

876
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:04,722
The game is afoot.

877
01:02:04,764 --> 01:02:08,181
And it will not end until one of us wins.

878
01:02:08,306 --> 01:02:12,681
I think he was missing you.

879
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:14,347
No, Indra.

880
01:02:15,597 --> 01:02:17,056
He's testing me.

881
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:21,430
So that, I take longer to solve his puzzles
and he can continue his killing spree.

882
01:02:21,431 --> 01:02:23,014
Bastard!

883
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:28,806
Sir, the number on the calculator,
176721790...

884
01:02:29,014 --> 01:02:30,221
What does it mean?

885
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:32,639
Password or an account number?

886
01:02:33,847 --> 01:02:35,431
And why the mud?

887
01:02:35,847 --> 01:02:38,764
Mud means soil.

888
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:44,971
Soil is earth. Earth!

889
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:47,014
The third element!

890
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,264
Right!

891
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:55,639
Mud, soil, dirt, dust...

892
01:02:57,639 --> 01:02:58,847
Bible!

893
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:08,097
"For dust you are...

894
01:03:08,931 --> 01:03:11,180
and to dust you will return."

895
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:13,306
Fantastic!

896
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:16,431
Cemetary.

897
01:03:16,764 --> 01:03:19,264
Karmakar, the next location
is a cemetary.

898
01:03:22,306 --> 01:03:24,056
This is your last chance, madam.

899
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:28,306
Do you want to perish like pests
after blowing away your inheritance?

900
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:30,931
Or do you want to live with respect?

901
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:33,222
Do you know how insects die?

902
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:37,556
Crushed under people's shoes.

903
01:03:41,847 --> 01:03:44,055
Sir, are you okay?

904
01:03:44,056 --> 01:03:45,931
I'm fine.

905
01:03:46,972 --> 01:03:48,847
176...

906
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:50,681
721...

907
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:53,556
790...

908
01:03:54,139 --> 01:04:01,639
176 plus 721 plus 790
equals 1687.

909
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,097
Job Charnock finds Kolkata.

910
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:08,596
No, no...

911
01:04:08,597 --> 01:04:12,806
After the High Court ruling in 2003
Job Charnock rules out.

912
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:17,847
1767 to 1790...

913
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:23,264
White cloth with three blue stripes...

914
01:04:23,681 --> 01:04:26,681
You mean blue and white, sir?

915
01:04:26,722 --> 01:04:28,471
Anything political?

916
01:04:28,472 --> 01:04:29,847
No.

917
01:04:31,764 --> 01:04:36,056
This stands for
Missionaries of Charity's colours.

918
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:39,806
White stands for
honesty and divinity.

919
01:04:40,889 --> 01:04:47,306
<i>And the three blue stripes
are for poverty, obedience and chastity.</i>

920
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:51,014
Missionaries of Charity.

921
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:54,846
Mother's House.
Mother Teresa...

922
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:59,431
We know that there's a cemetary involved...

923
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:03,347
Is it the one where
Mother Teresa was buried?

924
01:05:04,597 --> 01:05:07,097
She was buried in Mother's House.

925
01:05:07,431 --> 01:05:10,431
On the ground floor...
Not in any cemetary.

926
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:18,139
Mother Teresa Sarani is...

927
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:24,764
The former name of Mother Teresa Sarani
was Park Street.

928
01:05:24,931 --> 01:05:28,889
Before that it was called
Burial Ground Road.

929
01:05:30,972 --> 01:05:33,263
South Park Street Cemetary
was built in...

930
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:35,514
<i>in 1767 and...</i>

931
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:39,222
<i>it was closed in 1790.</i>

932
01:05:40,764 --> 01:05:45,556
And that's on Mother Teresa Sarani.

933
01:05:46,306 --> 01:05:48,764
South Park Street Cemetary.

934
01:05:49,764 --> 01:05:51,847
That's where our next victim is.

935
01:06:14,931 --> 01:06:17,597
Come on, Dhanonjoy.
Pick up, pick up. Pick up the phone!

936
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:17,597
- Oh my God!
- Come on. Come on!

937
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:18,889
Up! Up!

938
01:08:18,972 --> 01:08:21,264
Dhanonjoy! Dhanonjoy!

939
01:08:24,431 --> 01:08:26,222
- Is she alright?
- Yes.

940
01:08:27,931 --> 01:08:29,847
- Prasun, call an ambulance.
- Okay, sir.

941
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:33,347
Thank you so much.

942
01:08:33,764 --> 01:08:35,306
Thank... Thank you...

943
01:08:36,139 --> 01:08:39,680
You did it this time, Dhanonjoy.
You did it!

944
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:42,056
Sir, dictaphone.

945
01:08:43,222 --> 01:08:44,681
Play it.

946
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:47,680
<i>Hello, friend.</i>

947
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:50,555
<i>The person you've found here
is Menoka Churiwal.</i>

948
01:08:50,556 --> 01:08:52,389
<i>She had kicked God out of her life.</i>

949
01:08:52,514 --> 01:08:55,222
<i>She had thrown away
the precious gift of life.</i>

950
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:57,346
<i>She would waste away her father's money
if she were alive.</i>

951
01:08:57,347 --> 01:08:58,721
<i>She would have harmed others.</i>

952
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:01,639
<i>Her addiction would have turned her
into a living corpse.</i>

953
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:04,282
<i>She would have disregarded
other people just like her father.</i>

954
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,722
<i>That's why I buried her alive.</i>

955
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:09,096
<i>Once she's at the heart of the earth
she will realize...</i>

956
01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:11,305
<i>how she has disrespected the world.</i>

957
01:09:11,306 --> 01:09:14,388
After my father passed away,
I got depressed.

958
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:17,388
And I got into drugs
with some of my friends.

959
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:19,889
To keep myself distracted.

960
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:22,305
Okay, relax.

961
01:09:22,306 --> 01:09:23,930
What's your father's name?

962
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:25,771
And tell us about the accident
that killed him.

963
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:29,806
My papa's name is Prakash Churiwal.

964
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:31,639
It wasn't an accident.

965
01:09:31,931 --> 01:09:34,763
Somebody kidnapped him
and burnt him alive.

966
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:36,347
I know, I know.

967
01:09:37,681 --> 01:09:39,639
I was investigating your father's case.

968
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,847
Listen, you've seen the killer.

969
01:09:47,889 --> 01:09:50,306
You need to tell us
so that we can make a sketch.

970
01:09:50,431 --> 01:09:52,472
You need to help us, right?

971
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:54,181
Yeah, sure.

972
01:09:54,389 --> 01:09:56,056
Sir, the ambulance is here.

973
01:09:56,097 --> 01:10:00,764
- Please take her.
- Please come with us.

974
01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:05,764
Fire, water, earth.
Three elements are done.

975
01:10:06,472 --> 01:10:08,930
All that is left is sky and air.

976
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:10,847
Sir, can I say something?

977
01:10:11,347 --> 01:10:13,847
Isn't it becoming too complicated?

978
01:10:14,764 --> 01:10:17,056
Let me explain it to you.

979
01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:21,514
First victim, Shaon Basu.

980
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:24,181
He was burnt alive.

981
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:25,971
His office was burnt down too.

982
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:29,639
Which he had done himself
to claim insurance money.

983
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:34,097
And the second victim, Rohit Biswas
was an insurance agent.

984
01:10:34,222 --> 01:10:34,847
Right.

985
01:10:34,848 --> 01:10:39,264
Sir, was Rohit Biswas
Shaon Basu's insurance agent?

986
01:10:39,431 --> 01:10:41,263
You'll have to find that out.

987
01:10:41,264 --> 01:10:42,430
Sir.

988
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,097
Third victim.

989
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:46,139
Menoka Churiwal.

990
01:10:46,597 --> 01:10:50,806
Rich, drug addict brat.

991
01:10:51,056 --> 01:10:53,222
And her father was also burnt alive.

992
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:54,514
Correct.

993
01:10:55,472 --> 01:10:59,556
Churiwal was a silent partner
in Shaon Basu's company.

994
01:10:59,597 --> 01:11:03,764
That means he must have received
an equal insurance payout.

995
01:11:03,806 --> 01:11:05,471
Fifty-fifty.

996
01:11:05,472 --> 01:11:06,764
Right.

997
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:10,347
All the murders are related
to the five elements.

998
01:11:10,681 --> 01:11:12,556
Look at the way each murder took place.

999
01:11:12,722 --> 01:11:16,347
Shaon Basu and Churiwal
both killed by fire.

1000
01:11:18,139 --> 01:11:21,097
And since Churiwal's daughter
was spending the insurance money...

1001
01:11:21,347 --> 01:11:23,681
she was buried alive.

1002
01:11:23,764 --> 01:11:27,097
Then why was Rohit Biswas drowned?

1003
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:31,513
You need water to put out fire.

1004
01:11:31,514 --> 01:11:34,806
And after a fire accident
there is insurance claim.

1005
01:11:35,056 --> 01:11:36,306
That means money.

1006
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:39,931
Rohit Biswas must have realised
while drowning...

1007
01:11:40,306 --> 01:11:43,722
money can run life
but it can't save it.

1008
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:53,014
I'm sure he must have made a lot of money
from that scam.

1009
01:11:53,056 --> 01:11:54,889
You mean to say...

1010
01:11:54,972 --> 01:11:59,305
all these murders are related
to the office fire incident?

1011
01:11:59,306 --> 01:12:01,180
So, the people who were
killed two years ago...

1012
01:12:01,181 --> 01:12:03,096
Were they also related
to Shaon Basu's office?

1013
01:12:03,097 --> 01:12:06,472
Replace the question mark
with a full stop, Indra.

1014
01:12:06,514 --> 01:12:10,931
I'm sure they are all connected
to the office fire.

1015
01:12:11,764 --> 01:12:14,014
Two elements are still left.

1016
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:16,972
<i>Air and sky.</i>

1017
01:12:17,014 --> 01:12:19,806
Those two people are still alive, Karmakar.

1018
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:27,722
What is it?
What are you thinking?

1019
01:12:28,306 --> 01:12:29,264
Anything wrong?

1020
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:33,138
Sir, my intuition tell me
that the murderer is right here.

1021
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:33,889
What?

1022
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,722
And he's watching us.

1023
01:12:40,847 --> 01:12:44,056
- Dhanonjoy! Come! Follow!
- Sir!

1024
01:14:46,264 --> 01:14:48,139
Why did you get up?

1025
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:49,764
The doctor has asked you to rest.

1026
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:53,513
My wife and child have left me.
What's the point in resting?

1027
01:14:53,514 --> 01:14:55,139
What is this, Dhanonjoy?

1028
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:57,365
How can you risk your life
chasing a criminal like that?

1029
01:14:57,389 --> 01:15:00,847
When there's no life left
where is the risk?

1030
01:15:03,347 --> 01:15:06,097
Anyway, do you have
any new information on the murderer?

1031
01:15:06,222 --> 01:15:08,806
- Indra, update him.
- Yes, sir.

1032
01:15:09,347 --> 01:15:11,388
Sir, all your intuitions were right.

1033
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:12,471
Rohit Biswas...

1034
01:15:12,472 --> 01:15:16,096
He was the one taking care
of Shaon Basu's case.

1035
01:15:16,097 --> 01:15:17,472
He was involved in the scam.

1036
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:20,888
And the two policemen
who died two years back...

1037
01:15:20,889 --> 01:15:23,305
Yeah I know...
Prantik and Sandip Bhattacharya.

1038
01:15:23,306 --> 01:15:25,846
They were killed because
they took bribes to cover up the case.

1039
01:15:25,847 --> 01:15:28,556
Yes, sir. Then we're done.

1040
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,806
All the conspirators are dead.

1041
01:15:30,847 --> 01:15:33,431
In fact, both the silent partners too.

1042
01:15:33,847 --> 01:15:35,472
Slow down.

1043
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:37,431
Let me think.

1044
01:15:37,764 --> 01:15:38,597
Sir...

1045
01:15:38,598 --> 01:15:40,138
Play the clip again.

1046
01:15:40,139 --> 01:15:42,472
- Sir, the audio clip?
- Just play it.

1047
01:15:51,556 --> 01:15:53,514
Pause it...

1048
01:15:53,972 --> 01:15:56,181
Sir, did you find a clue?

1049
01:15:56,514 --> 01:15:59,181
He was speaking
very clearly on the phone.

1050
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:00,638
I mean fluent Bengali.

1051
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,846
Your deductions...

1052
01:16:02,847 --> 01:16:04,221
<i>give me goosebumps.</i>

1053
01:16:04,222 --> 01:16:06,514
Doesn't it sound different here?

1054
01:16:06,556 --> 01:16:08,639
Play it again.

1055
01:16:11,764 --> 01:16:13,181
Just stop it.

1056
01:16:13,222 --> 01:16:16,472
Sir, I think he recorded
someone else's voice.

1057
01:16:17,264 --> 01:16:19,764
That means there's someone else
with him.

1058
01:16:28,722 --> 01:16:30,597
- Indra...
- Sir?

1059
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:34,014
Do you know how these cartoon voices
are made?

1060
01:16:34,472 --> 01:16:36,846
Yes, sir.
First they record the voice normally.

1061
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:39,681
Then they manipulate the speed...

1062
01:16:44,306 --> 01:16:47,597
Sir, did your five element guy
record the sound like this?

1063
01:16:48,056 --> 01:16:49,681
Correct.

1064
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,431
Unmix the voice and play the real voice.

1065
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:55,056
Yes, sir.

1066
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,139
Ready, sir.

1067
01:17:27,347 --> 01:17:28,556
Play it.

1068
01:17:29,347 --> 01:17:33,931
<i>Let's see if your Superman dad
can save you.</i>

1069
01:17:34,597 --> 01:17:38,181
This sounds like a kid's voice.

1070
01:17:39,181 --> 01:17:42,056
<i>Let's see if your Superman dad
can save you.</i>

1071
01:17:42,389 --> 01:17:44,931
You would save me like Superman.

1072
01:17:45,097 --> 01:17:46,638
Gogol sent it for you.

1073
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:48,138
He made it in this drawing class.

1074
01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:49,471
S... t!

1075
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:51,764
That's Gogol's voice, sir!

1076
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:54,472
He's using my son.

1077
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,014
Sir... Gogol...

1078
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:02,014
Let's go, Gogol.

1079
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,014
Wear the seatbelt.

1080
01:18:07,931 --> 01:18:09,931
What? Gogol isn't home yet?

1081
01:18:11,389 --> 01:18:13,306
Anyone at school knows anything?

1082
01:18:18,514 --> 01:18:20,347
Gogol is missing!

1083
01:18:22,347 --> 01:18:23,806
- I know...
- What do you mean?

1084
01:18:24,056 --> 01:18:24,972
- Indra...
- Yes?

1085
01:18:24,973 --> 01:18:28,180
I need the list of all the people
who died in Shaon Basu's office fire.

1086
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:29,513
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:18:29,514 --> 01:18:30,514
Hurry.

1088
01:18:30,597 --> 01:18:32,639
I'm such a fool.

1089
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:36,097
I took seven years to realise
that it is a case of revenge, sir.

1090
01:18:36,181 --> 01:18:39,597
He is a family member
of one of the victims.

1091
01:18:39,847 --> 01:18:41,764
But I can't figure out who it is.

1092
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:43,681
Someone who is connected
to Gogol's school.

1093
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,221
<i>All because of you.</i>

1094
01:18:49,222 --> 01:18:51,138
There's no peace even
when we're away from you.

1095
01:18:51,139 --> 01:18:52,513
Gogol is in danger
because of you.

1096
01:18:52,514 --> 01:18:54,806
There's no point in blaming me, Malini.

1097
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:56,971
I'll not let him take Gogol
away from me.

1098
01:18:56,972 --> 01:18:58,931
I'll not let him win.

1099
01:18:58,972 --> 01:19:00,698
Seven murders can be pardoned
but not the eighth.

1100
01:19:00,722 --> 01:19:03,180
Please bring Gogol back, Dhanonjoy.

1101
01:19:03,181 --> 01:19:06,347
Please trust me
for the last time in your life, Malini.

1102
01:19:06,597 --> 01:19:09,181
I will bring Gogol back.

1103
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:13,055
Otherwise, no Gogol will ever trust
their dad again.

1104
01:19:13,056 --> 01:19:15,389
Sir, the list of casualities is ready.

1105
01:19:15,597 --> 01:19:19,221
The people who died in the accident
were a security guard...

1106
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,597
the peon and a woman
named Sneha Bhattacharya.

1107
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:24,096
She is survived by her husband.

1108
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:26,014
His name is Arko Bhattacharya.

1109
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:29,597
Arko? Arko Bhattacharya?

1110
01:19:29,722 --> 01:19:32,221
Gogol's class teacher's name is
Arko Bhattacharya.

1111
01:19:32,222 --> 01:19:34,181
What does that have to do with Gogol?

1112
01:19:34,306 --> 01:19:36,221
That's why children are like magic.

1113
01:19:36,222 --> 01:19:38,388
They paint the grey canvas of life...

1114
01:19:38,389 --> 01:19:39,763
with their joyful rainbows...

1115
01:19:39,764 --> 01:19:41,264
<i>with their favourite colours.</i>

1116
01:19:41,347 --> 01:19:43,097
Where's the sketch?

1117
01:19:43,347 --> 01:19:45,556
Suresh... Sketch.

1118
01:19:48,139 --> 01:19:49,139
<i>Hello.</i>

1119
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:50,889
Finally, we meet.

1120
01:19:51,264 --> 01:19:55,847
He has... He has...
kidnapped Gogol...

1121
01:19:55,931 --> 01:19:57,346
You are his favourite teacher.

1122
01:19:57,347 --> 01:19:58,722
Gogol is my favourite student.

1123
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:01,347
He has not only kidnapped Gogol...

1124
01:20:01,806 --> 01:20:03,805
He has committed seven murders.

1125
01:20:03,806 --> 01:20:05,889
Sir, he has cancer too.

1126
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:07,972
Show him the report.

1127
01:20:09,056 --> 01:20:10,056
Sir.

1128
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:14,431
Lung cancer...

1129
01:20:14,681 --> 01:20:15,961
I don't have too much time left.

1130
01:20:17,639 --> 01:20:18,805
<i>That's why the rush.</i>

1131
01:20:18,806 --> 01:20:19,389
<i>Amazing.</i>

1132
01:20:19,431 --> 01:20:21,847
We've got both motive and clue.

1133
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:22,556
- Prasun.
- Sir!

1134
01:20:22,557 --> 01:20:24,388
- Get the force ready. We'll leave now.
- Yes, sir.

1135
01:20:24,389 --> 01:20:25,472
Let's move.

1136
01:20:25,722 --> 01:20:27,597
I'll go alone, sir.

1137
01:20:28,097 --> 01:20:29,097
What?

1138
01:20:29,847 --> 01:20:34,763
He has taken Gogol hostage
because he wants me to face him.

1139
01:20:34,764 --> 01:20:36,097
<i>Now you say it.</i>

1140
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:38,056
Just like I taught you.

1141
01:20:38,264 --> 01:20:41,597
Let's see if your Superman dad
can save you.

1142
01:20:42,722 --> 01:20:43,722
Your turn.

1143
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:49,306
Let's see if your Superman dad
can save you.

1144
01:20:50,806 --> 01:20:52,264
Very good.

1145
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:54,556
What does it mean, sir?

1146
01:21:50,847 --> 01:21:52,222
Welcome!

1147
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:53,763
A very warm welcome, my friend!

1148
01:21:53,764 --> 01:21:55,222
Where is Gogol?

1149
01:21:55,389 --> 01:21:57,305
Speak softly.

1150
01:21:57,306 --> 01:22:00,264
I just put Gogol to sleep
after a lot of effort.

1151
01:22:00,389 --> 01:22:01,847
What if he wakes up now?

1152
01:22:02,181 --> 01:22:03,389
Quietly...

1153
01:22:06,681 --> 01:22:09,972
Let's finish our story first.

1154
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:14,806
Bengalis can't do without tea.
I'm sure you'll have some.

1155
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:18,056
You don't have to tell me any story,
Arko Bhattacharya.

1156
01:22:19,097 --> 01:22:21,264
Your story is very clear to me.

1157
01:22:22,847 --> 01:22:26,014
It took you seven years
to understand my story.

1158
01:22:26,139 --> 01:22:28,847
Sugar? Oh, you don't take sugar...

1159
01:22:29,014 --> 01:22:29,889
Go ahead.

1160
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:31,763
Tell me the story that's clear to you.

1161
01:22:31,764 --> 01:22:34,681
I'm all ears.
I'll correct you if you're wrong.

1162
01:22:35,056 --> 01:22:37,056
Your wife, Sneha.

1163
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:42,347
She died in the office fire
of "Panchamahabhoot Pvt. Ltd."

1164
01:22:42,806 --> 01:22:44,556
The owner of the office, Shaon Basu.

1165
01:22:44,597 --> 01:22:46,806
He set the office on fire
to get insurance money.

1166
01:22:47,056 --> 01:22:49,376
Since then, you've been killing
one person after another...

1167
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:55,056
Don't turn my story
into a cheap novella, please.

1168
01:22:55,306 --> 01:22:59,222
Maybe, you should get back
to catching cat burglars...

1169
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:01,472
I'm out of your league.

1170
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:08,139
Your life is not in any league now...

1171
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:10,722
It's in my hands.

1172
01:23:12,597 --> 01:23:14,971
Just remember one thing, friend.

1173
01:23:14,972 --> 01:23:18,389
Life is relative.
Here today, gone tomorrow.

1174
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:25,347
But the soul never dies.

1175
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:28,181
It dissipates.

1176
01:23:31,722 --> 01:23:35,764
Just like Sneha's soul.

1177
01:23:35,931 --> 01:23:37,681
It dissipated.

1178
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:42,139
And one more soul with her.

1179
01:23:42,514 --> 01:23:45,181
In it's most nascent stage.

1180
01:23:46,097 --> 01:23:47,805
What do you mean?

1181
01:23:47,806 --> 01:23:49,139
Meaning?

1182
01:23:50,514 --> 01:23:53,430
You're going crazy
because you haven't seen Gogol for a day.

1183
01:23:53,431 --> 01:23:55,847
You've come to me to solve the mystery.

1184
01:23:57,347 --> 01:23:59,014
Tell me.

1185
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:00,889
How would you feel?

1186
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:04,596
If you lost Gogol forever
right in front of your eyes.

1187
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:06,014
Just stop it!

1188
01:24:06,306 --> 01:24:08,056
Stop it right there!

1189
01:24:08,139 --> 01:24:13,556
You can plot your revenge against
Rohit, Shaon, Churiwal but...

1190
01:24:13,889 --> 01:24:15,221
not against Gogol.

1191
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:17,139
But Gogol is a part of it.

1192
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:20,597
If Gogol wasn't there then...

1193
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,555
the five elements...

1194
01:24:22,556 --> 01:24:23,680
the five senses...

1195
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:26,161
the five components, the five years...
None of it would add up.

1196
01:24:27,097 --> 01:24:30,472
Maybe, instead of Gogol,
the name would be something else.

1197
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:34,389
That day, alongwith Sneha, our...

1198
01:24:39,722 --> 01:24:41,347
What?

1199
01:24:42,472 --> 01:24:45,764
Sneha was pregnant?

1200
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:47,014
Bloody hell!

1201
01:24:47,639 --> 01:24:49,721
I thought police always arrives late
in movies.

1202
01:24:49,722 --> 01:24:51,639
Why are your ideas coming to you late?

1203
01:24:51,722 --> 01:24:53,513
You were so busy drinking...

1204
01:24:53,514 --> 01:24:56,306
that you didn't even check
the medical reports of the casualities.

1205
01:25:05,597 --> 01:25:07,889
I can show you sympathy, Arko.

1206
01:25:08,597 --> 01:25:10,014
But I can't forgive you.

1207
01:25:11,556 --> 01:25:14,972
You've killed one after another person
in the name of revenge.

1208
01:25:15,264 --> 01:25:16,806
And that's a crime.

1209
01:25:17,972 --> 01:25:21,806
When God and Satan play a game of chess
they do so honestly.

1210
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:25,264
If God loses he calls it betrayal.

1211
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:28,389
And Satan says it's the rule.

1212
01:25:28,681 --> 01:25:31,263
I thought you would understand me,
know me.

1213
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,181
But now I see...

1214
01:25:32,182 --> 01:25:34,514
Stop your nonsense
and tell me where Gogol is.

1215
01:25:35,014 --> 01:25:36,681
Where is Gogol?

1216
01:25:37,264 --> 01:25:39,264
Why do you keep thinking...

1217
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:42,306
that you'll win at the game
that I created?

1218
01:25:42,556 --> 01:25:44,096
You can win...

1219
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,722
when I accept my own defeat.

1220
01:25:50,222 --> 01:25:51,763
Think about it.

1221
01:25:51,764 --> 01:25:54,014
Who should be alive?

1222
01:25:54,847 --> 01:25:57,972
You, me or Gogol?

1223
01:26:02,806 --> 01:26:05,722
Come on, Move! fast!
Come on!

1224
01:26:10,389 --> 01:26:12,889
Hold your fire until you get the order.

1225
01:26:13,264 --> 01:26:14,972
This way, my friend.

1226
01:26:16,389 --> 01:26:18,597
- Gogol... Gogol...
- Quiet...

1227
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,806
Keep your voice down.
Can't you see he is sleeping?

1228
01:26:20,972 --> 01:26:22,806
I am ready to lose.

1229
01:26:22,847 --> 01:26:24,430
Please let him go.
He has not done any harm.

1230
01:26:24,431 --> 01:26:26,805
- Please it's not his fault.
- What was his Sneha's fault?

1231
01:26:26,806 --> 01:26:27,888
- What?
- Yeah.

1232
01:26:27,889 --> 01:26:29,513
What was my child's fault?

1233
01:26:29,514 --> 01:26:31,763
And what's my fault?

1234
01:26:31,764 --> 01:26:34,763
I've never smoked in my life.
Then why do I have lung cancer?

1235
01:26:34,764 --> 01:26:36,013
Why this injustice?

1236
01:26:36,014 --> 01:26:38,806
Please, please, I'm begging you.
Let him go.

1237
01:26:38,847 --> 01:26:39,971
Please!

1238
01:26:39,972 --> 01:26:42,681
I had also begged like this.

1239
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:43,763
Knocked on every door...

1240
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:47,305
looking for justice
for the murder of my wife and child.

1241
01:26:47,306 --> 01:26:49,680
No one gave me justice.

1242
01:26:49,681 --> 01:26:51,596
That's why you'll kill a child
for revenge?

1243
01:26:51,597 --> 01:26:52,597
No!

1244
01:26:53,056 --> 01:26:53,931
This is my protest.

1245
01:26:53,932 --> 01:26:55,971
What is revenge for you,
is protest for me.

1246
01:26:55,972 --> 01:26:58,346
You've completely lost your mind.
You've gone mad!

1247
01:26:58,347 --> 01:26:59,513
We're all crazy.

1248
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,763
I'm chasing the five elements
like a mad man.

1249
01:27:01,764 --> 01:27:03,347
And you're chasing me
like a mad man.

1250
01:27:03,556 --> 01:27:06,306
- Arko, no. Arko, please...
- No, wait...

1251
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:08,889
- Gogol loves me.
- Don't...

1252
01:27:09,097 --> 01:27:10,556
He will take me further.

1253
01:27:10,931 --> 01:27:11,971
Don't move.

1254
01:27:11,972 --> 01:27:13,014
Just see what happens.

1255
01:27:13,056 --> 01:27:15,014
Just wait and watch
where he takes me.

1256
01:27:15,222 --> 01:27:16,930
- Arko, please...
- Just watch...

1257
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,347
Please don't do this.

1258
01:27:18,681 --> 01:27:20,722
- Arko... Gogol!
- Hey, don't move.

1259
01:28:12,014 --> 01:28:13,532
How long are we supposed to
wait outside like this?

1260
01:28:13,556 --> 01:28:15,431
We have no clue about
what's happening inside.

1261
01:28:17,389 --> 01:28:18,847
I think we should move in now.

1262
01:28:18,889 --> 01:28:19,931
No, sir.

1263
01:28:20,097 --> 01:28:21,097
Sir...

1264
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,805
There's something I've learnt
from Dhanonjoy.

1265
01:28:23,806 --> 01:28:25,014
That is intuition.

1266
01:28:25,306 --> 01:28:26,514
Deduction, sir.

1267
01:28:27,389 --> 01:28:29,347
And my intuition tells me...

1268
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:31,556
It's not a failed cop who walked in...

1269
01:28:32,139 --> 01:28:34,556
but a father trying to save his son.

1270
01:28:35,139 --> 01:28:36,971
He'll definitely come back with his son.

1271
01:28:36,972 --> 01:28:39,139
Sir, we should wait for the signal.
Please, sir.

1272
01:28:56,306 --> 01:28:58,097
- Gogol...
- Why are you afraid, Gogol?

1273
01:28:58,681 --> 01:29:00,722
You told me you're dad is Superman.

1274
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:03,097
He'll save you for sure.

1275
01:29:04,264 --> 01:29:05,347
Arko...

1276
01:29:06,306 --> 01:29:08,681
Even God doesn't consider himself
omnipotent.

1277
01:29:09,389 --> 01:29:12,556
The day He does...

1278
01:29:14,389 --> 01:29:17,264
there won't be a difference between
God and Satan.

1279
01:29:18,556 --> 01:29:21,722
That's why I like you so much,
my friend.

1280
01:29:21,972 --> 01:29:26,681
You're right at the edge
but you refuse to give up.

1281
01:29:28,097 --> 01:29:31,139
Only time will tell who is right
and who is wrong.

1282
01:29:32,556 --> 01:29:34,014
Do you get it?

1283
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:35,921
The wind is changing direction.

1284
01:29:40,181 --> 01:29:44,431
Gogol... tell your dad...

1285
01:29:44,514 --> 01:29:46,306
what I've taught you in class.

1286
01:29:46,931 --> 01:29:48,514
What's the definition of wind?

1287
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:50,014
Tell us.

1288
01:29:50,222 --> 01:29:51,347
Go ahead.

1289
01:29:58,931 --> 01:30:00,306
Good boy.

1290
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:05,097
So, now do you get it, friend?

1291
01:30:06,097 --> 01:30:09,389
We're all tied together
with the same string.

1292
01:30:11,889 --> 01:30:14,556
You have heart problems.
I have lung cancer.

1293
01:30:14,931 --> 01:30:15,931
And...

1294
01:30:16,139 --> 01:30:17,889
poor Gogol has asthma.

1295
01:30:18,806 --> 01:30:20,806
Two sides of the same coin.

1296
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:22,514
Black and white.

1297
01:30:23,306 --> 01:30:24,681
Order and chaos.

1298
01:30:24,889 --> 01:30:26,097
Yin and yang.

1299
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,221
Please, let me through.

1300
01:30:30,222 --> 01:30:31,763
- Please... let me go...
- Madam, please stop.

1301
01:30:31,764 --> 01:30:33,596
- Gogol! Gogol!
- Please let her go...

1302
01:30:33,597 --> 01:30:35,138
- Gogol! Gogol!
- Please don't go ahead...

1303
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:36,639
- Calm down.
- Relax.

1304
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:38,305
Please let me in... Please.

1305
01:30:38,306 --> 01:30:39,806
- Don't worry. Relax.
- Gogol!

1306
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:46,097
Arko, please help him.
He can't breath.

1307
01:30:47,472 --> 01:30:49,597
Just let him out of the room.
He'll survive please.

1308
01:30:50,347 --> 01:30:51,555
Arko, please, let him out.

1309
01:30:51,556 --> 01:30:55,264
Now can you understand
what is important in life?

1310
01:30:55,347 --> 01:30:58,514
Air... that you can feel...

1311
01:30:58,722 --> 01:31:02,096
And your son is as important to you
as the air you breath.

1312
01:31:02,097 --> 01:31:05,306
And he can't breathe...
He's in a lot of pain.

1313
01:31:11,056 --> 01:31:15,222
<i>"I give myself to the winds of spring"</i>

1314
01:31:16,514 --> 01:31:20,847
I've given up my entire life
just for this moment.

1315
01:31:22,014 --> 01:31:24,139
Just to stand in front of you.

1316
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:28,263
Don't ruin this moment.

1317
01:31:28,264 --> 01:31:32,222
Please let Gogol go.
Please Arko.

1318
01:31:33,597 --> 01:31:34,638
- Daddy.
- Yeah...

1319
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,264
Please give me the inhaler.

1320
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:38,638
I can't breathe.

1321
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:39,721
Gogol, keep breathing.

1322
01:31:39,722 --> 01:31:40,722
Try to breath.

1323
01:31:41,681 --> 01:31:43,346
Take deep breaths.

1324
01:31:43,347 --> 01:31:45,056
Gogol, keep breathing.

1325
01:31:45,681 --> 01:31:48,181
Arko... Arko...

1326
01:31:48,431 --> 01:31:49,638
Please send him out of this room.

1327
01:31:49,639 --> 01:31:51,971
Arko, he will live...

1328
01:31:51,972 --> 01:31:54,972
No one lives forever.

1329
01:31:55,514 --> 01:31:58,556
Everyone has to die.
Everyone.

1330
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:02,681
They only leave a mark behind.

1331
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:35,806
- Go, go, go!
- Gogol... Gogol...

1332
01:32:38,139 --> 01:32:41,056
The war is over, Arko.

1333
01:32:42,389 --> 01:32:44,472
Only the tiebreaker was missing.

1334
01:32:45,972 --> 01:32:51,181
I'm a teacher, my friend.

1335
01:32:51,889 --> 01:32:56,597
My real lesson is doing
the right thing at the right time.

1336
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:02,556
The ones who waste time playing
when they should be studying.

1337
01:33:04,056 --> 01:33:07,097
Can't forget "The Book of Alphabets".

1338
01:33:07,347 --> 01:33:11,931
I can't leave before my work is done.

1339
01:33:12,056 --> 01:33:16,764
There's just one thing left for
you to do... Going to prison.

1340
01:33:21,931 --> 01:33:25,139
Five... The five elements...

1341
01:33:25,764 --> 01:33:28,889
Earth, water...

1342
01:33:29,847 --> 01:33:32,556
fire, air and...

1343
01:33:34,722 --> 01:33:35,847
Arko! Arko, wait!

1344
01:33:36,097 --> 01:33:38,347
- Gogol!
- Mom!

1345
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,514
Thank you, God!

1346
01:33:40,972 --> 01:33:45,264
- Are you okay?
- Yes...

1347
01:33:57,806 --> 01:34:00,389
Sky... Space!

1348
01:34:05,764 --> 01:34:09,806
You want to kill me under the open sky?

1349
01:34:13,264 --> 01:34:16,181
There's nothing left in life, my friend.

1350
01:34:26,347 --> 01:34:31,639
Look, so many people are
waiting to see you.

1351
01:34:31,889 --> 01:34:35,556
To see you... To hear you...

1352
01:34:36,306 --> 01:34:40,264
Your turn is up, Arko Bhattacharya.
Now it's the police's turn.

1353
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:45,181
It's a tough game to play with the police.

1354
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:48,639
Will you be able to handle it?

1355
01:34:49,222 --> 01:34:54,639
You've killed a lot of people
for your principles.

1356
01:34:55,014 --> 01:34:59,181
You will be punished, friend.

1357
01:35:01,889 --> 01:35:09,889
"At the end of the battle of Kurukshetra,
two drops of tears fell from Arjuna's eyes.

1358
01:35:11,264 --> 01:35:15,306
For his own brother, Karan."

1359
01:35:18,722 --> 01:35:24,889
Karan won that day even though he died.

1360
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:28,347
When Arjuna cried for him.

1361
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:34,306
And today, even though I got caught...

1362
01:35:35,014 --> 01:35:37,514
I'll defeat you.

1363
01:35:39,889 --> 01:35:42,097
No...

1364
01:35:47,514 --> 01:35:49,514
I won't let you win, Arko.

1365
01:35:49,722 --> 01:35:53,305
- This is cheating.
- What about how life cheated me?

1366
01:35:53,306 --> 01:35:55,763
Let me go.

1367
01:35:55,764 --> 01:35:59,097
Today I'll defeat life
and be one with the sky.

1368
01:35:59,139 --> 01:36:02,139
You can't change the rules
of the game like this.

1369
01:36:02,181 --> 01:36:05,097
Without space nothing adds up.

1370
01:36:05,722 --> 01:36:07,722
The circle completes.

1371
01:36:08,097 --> 01:36:12,056
Perfect rhyme, my friend.
We'll meet again.

1372
01:36:12,306 --> 01:36:15,430
On the path to salvation.
Goodbye, friend.

1373
01:36:15,431 --> 01:36:18,237
- Bye!
- No!

1374
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:46,888
<i>Coming home after losing a friend</i>

1375
01:36:46,889 --> 01:36:53,138
<i>Dusty fields, hold me down</i>

1376
01:36:53,139 --> 01:37:00,889
<i>No tiremarks felt behind at the curb</i>

1377
01:37:01,389 --> 01:37:07,430
<i>No neighbour with a wall</i>

1378
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:13,680
<i>Who? What? When? Why?</i>

1379
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:19,931
<i>The disobedient candle flickers</i>

1380
01:37:20,014 --> 01:37:27,806
<i>Why is there a crack in my window?</i>

1381
01:37:28,222 --> 01:37:34,764
<i>I have no hidden agendas, neighbour</i>

1382
01:37:35,431 --> 01:37:38,514
<i>I know you can hear my song</i>

1383
01:37:38,556 --> 01:37:41,639
<i>You are lending me your ear</i>

1384
01:37:41,681 --> 01:37:47,264
<i>And you are lonely just like me</i>

1385
01:37:47,764 --> 01:37:54,014
<i>But I'm not as good as you think</i>

1386
01:37:54,181 --> 01:38:00,431
<i>Don't think too much
Don't stay up too late</i>
