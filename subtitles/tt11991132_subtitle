I will catch that rat today

10
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,386
Listen, what's wrong with him?

11
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:47,106
Since morning, he is up to something.
I'm confused

12
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:08,226
Sir, coffee

13
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:15,786
Sir...

14
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,506
isn't this the gate outside?

15
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,506
Peep and you can see it. Why sit
here and view it through the camera?

16
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,466
You won't get it even if I explain.
Now, leave

17
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:16,666
Hey! You little rat!

18
00:05:21,306 --> 00:05:24,266

20
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,746
7 marks out of 50!

21
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:40,706
Well done!

22
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:44,266
Looks like you aren't leaving
school even after 20 years

23
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,066
- Now, how about this girl?
- Sir

24
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,346
- What's this?
- Deepavali crackers

25
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:52,666
Deepavali crackers?

26
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,146
Yes, sir

27
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,586
See that?

28
00:05:54,826 --> 00:05:57,546
Look how much she
respects this teacher

29
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,106
No, sir. My father asked me to
distribute it to all the teachers

30
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:02,786
- You may leave
- Ok, sir

31
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,786
Shows up with atom bomb
to embarrass a teacher!

32
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,826
Sir, who are you?
What do you want?

33
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,186
Where is the Head Master(HM)?

34
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,946
HM has stepped out.
Come tomorrow

35
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:34,826
Do you know who I am?

36
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:36,906
How dare you speak
to me like this?

37
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,906
You want me to phone the
state education office?

38
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:40,906
Sir, why are you getting upset?

39
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,426
HM sir has gone to attend a
baby's 'ear piercing' function

40
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:44,746
It'll take two hours
for him to reach

41
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:47,426
Please wait there until then. Come on, sir.
Let me get you a chair

42
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:49,386
- Have a seat
- This is ridiculous!

43
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:50,626
- I told him the truth...
- Irresponsible!

44
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:51,946
What kind of school is this?

45
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:53,186
- Sir...
- Where the hell is HM?

46
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:54,866
Who set the fire over there?

47
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:55,586
Wait, I'm coming

48
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,546
- Sir...Sir, he'll be back soon
- Irresponsible! How can he behave like this?

49
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,466
Who is it?

50
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:02,186
Uh-oh! 'Donald Trump' is here but why?

51
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:05,026
I'm not going for a feast to follow me!
Get inside and study!

52
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,866
This is too much! I can't
tolerate it anymore!

53
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,626
I want to see the HM right now!-
- Sir... Sir please...

54
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:13,146
- Aiyo! Sorry, sir
- Where are you eyes? Watch out!

55
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,106
Take it and get inside!

56
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,546
- Aiy-aiyo! This guy's talkingin English!
- I want to see the HM right now!

57
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:17,986
He's all yours. See you

58
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,106
HM is on a holiday, today

59
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,746
I am Subramani. I'm the acting HM.
Any help?

60
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:22,826
You know who I am?

61
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:23,986
Yeah! I know

62
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,666
"Very, very you sir!" Do you
need admission for any student?

63
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:28,786
- A rat from your school...
- A rat?

64
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,266
daily comes to my house and changes
all the writing that I have been writing

65
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,226
- So, he's talking about a rat
- And...

66
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:37,026
it spoils my whole day and my mood!

67
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,346
Sir, please don't mistake me

68
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,426
This is a school

69
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,106
If you're facing rat
troubles at home....

70
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:45,466
then complain at your locality's Panchayath
board and they will take care of it

71
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:47,506
You're a bloody bigger rat, man!

72
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:48,826
- Could it be a raccoon problem?
- Are you a teacher?

73
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:51,466
Sir, I swear...

74
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,426
I know English but I can't understand
the language you're speaking

75
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:55,626
Please talk in Tamil

76
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,146
Why are you tensed?

77
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:12,586
I'm the one they are looking for

78
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:16,786
What is the matter?

79
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,786
I'll tell you later. We must
escape from here first!

80
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,386
Not "We" but you!

81
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,346
- Don't call yourself my friend!
- Come on...

82
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:26,906
Friendship is as good as the love shown
towards a goat that is about to be sacrificed

83
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:29,226
Stop kidding and give
me some idea to escape

84
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:31,466
I'm thinking...

85
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:32,546
Make it fast!

86
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,266
We are catching teacher's attention!

87
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:36,506
What is it?

88
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:38,666
Give me your bag

89
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:39,306
Why?

90
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:41,466
- Just give it
- What are you taking out?

91
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,466
Why do you need that?

92
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:45,506
Please come, sir

93
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,346
Sir, let's start from this class

94
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:56,466
Opening the calib...
Good morning, sir

95
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:57,466
Good morning

96
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,306
Sir, check if the rat
you're looking for, is here

97
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:09,066
No. Next

98
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:11,586
Sir, next is the 11th grade

99
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,866
Since the rat is not here, I'm sure
it'll be in that class. Come on

100
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:37,546
Why are you in a spot, Subramani?
She isn't here nor there

101
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,786
Sir, this is the last class. The rat is in
this class for sure. It's trapped. Come on

102
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:50,186
Good morning, sir

103
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:20,706
Yay!

dances to the tune of breeze"

fascinated when my ankets makes noise"

Shanmugam...

117
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:12,346
send her to my tution centre

118
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,986
I'll set her straight and
ensure she focuses on studies

119
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,946
Sir, what is a girl child
going achieve after studying?

120
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:21,426
I'm sending her to school since
it's nearby in the neigbourhood

121
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:22,186
Sami...

122
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:23,506
- Tighten that wheel
- Ok, sir

123
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:24,626
Look here...

124
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:28,026
our duty will be over once we marry
off our daughters as soon as possible

125
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,226
Let her be happy and have fun until then

126
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,906

Come and read the news for me

128
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,666
Daddy, are you sending me to school
so that I can read the news to you?

129
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,986
I've been reading news

00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,586
...that it has earned me a nickname
"All India Radio - Akashavani"

131
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:07,306

people who says so

00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,066
Now, read it

raised in here today

174
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:18,386
Why?

175
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,106
Your son failed

176
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:22,386
What?

177
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:24,546
Your son failed!

178
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:36,266
Those guys came in with sweets
even before knowing their results

179
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:40,266
Being the only son, I spent well and put
him in a convent school in Tanjavur

180
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:43,146
But this doofus neither studies hard
nor is smart enough to pass exams!

181
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,226
Why gift me with
such a son, Lord?!

182
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,266
I didn't ask you to study
and become an IAS officer

183
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,626
Get a degree to that we can proudly put next
to your name in your wedding invitation

184
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,906
Stop drinking the coffee and think
what are you going to do next!

185
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,146
Kamali...

186
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,586
Go, bring your father

187
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,466
He hasn't ate since morning

188
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:32,426
He is regretting as if
he has failed the exams

189
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,906
- Go, get him
- Ok

190
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:43,306
Daddy...

191
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,026
come, let's have out dinner

192
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:46,986
I'm not hungry, dear

193
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,426
But I am hungry, daddy

194
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,266
Come, let's eat

195
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,346
Fine, I'll come. Leave me

196
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,106
In the CBSE 12th results
published today...

197
00:16:55,146 --> 00:17:00,106
96% of the girls and 92% of
the boys have passed

198
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:03,026
Chennai's PSK school
student, Ashwin...

199
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:06,946
secured 1st rank in All India
level by scoring 499/500

200
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:09,706
Now let's check out Ashwin's
interview with our reporter

201
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,586
- Hi Ashwin
- Hi

202
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:14,586
- Hi
- Hi

203
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:19,306
1st rank in the national level in
CBSE 12th grade! How do you feel?

204
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:20,706
I'm really very happy

205
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:25,266
And of course this is definitely a result of
lot of hard work and hours of midnight oil

206
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,866
At this juncture I should
thank my mom, teachers...

207
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,746
and friends for all their
support and guidance

208
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,826
Without which I would not have
been able to achieve this

209
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:36,666
Well, Ashwin you've secured the
top rank in 12th grade, CBSE...

210
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,826
What's your future plan?

211
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,666
I want to get into B.Tech/
Computer Science in IIT, Madras

212
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:44,146
- Nice Ashwin. Wish you all the best

213
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:46,786
What would you like to tell
your juniors at this juncture?

214
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,186
There's nothing new that I got to say

215
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:56,106
It's the same what he said

216
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:57,786
In order to excel...

217
00:17:58,186 --> 00:17:59,386
all I did is follow him

218
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:03,426
And I encourage everyone to
follow what he repeatedly told us

219
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:05,786
"Have a dream. Believe in yourself"

220
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:06,626
"Work hard..."

221
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:09,426
"and you're destined
to realize your dream"

222
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,666
His parents are lucky to have such a son

223
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,106
No matter how much gold
they demand in dowry...

224
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,826
we must marry off my grand daughter
to a well educated boy like him

225
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,746
Had a great time with you, Ashwin.
Thank you so much

226
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:24,546
Thank you

227
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:39,113
Mummy, where is my sticker Bindi?

228
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:40,513
It's right there! Look properly

229
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:44,633
I got that

230
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,033
Kamali, what has
happened to you today?

231
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,113
Why are you leaving so early?

232
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:20,393
Grandma...

233
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:23,113
This is new!

234
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,193
Come on, grandma

235
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,193
Didn't you read my horoscope?

236
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,753
Yes. What's the matter?

237
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:34,433
What was the predicted first and last
letter of the boy whom I'm going to marry?

238
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:37,313
Do you really need this
when you got school?

239
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,593
Just like that, I want to know.
Tell me, Jillu

240
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:41,393
Well, that one...

241
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:43,273
It was....

242
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,673
...a name that will start with letter A...

243
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,593
...and end with N

244
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,153
Superb grandma!

245
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:51,473
Bye!

246
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:22,633
There is something fishy about her today

247
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,033
- Hi
- Come on

248
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,553
You look very beautiful today.
What's the matter?

249
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:32,033
What's this new found shyness in you?

250
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,113
Are you parents looking for a groom?

251
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:37,353
Stop pulling my leg!

252
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:39,233
You're hiding something from me

253
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,473
Nothing like that

254
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:41,553
Stop thinking too much

255
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:47,833
Look at that

256
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:51,433
Ashiwn looks so smart and fair

257
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,793
He looks like a cinema star

258
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,753
Don't even get me started
on guys from our place

259
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:58,313
Don't ponder too much

260
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:01,913
Aren't you already engaged to that Pandian?
Go, romance him

261
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:05,633
Hey Akashavani, what's your
problem if I drool at him?

262
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:07,713
It's not like he is
your fiance or lover

263
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,153
Mind your own business

264
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,153
Get lost!

265
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:14,553
- What's your problem?
- Kamali!

266
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,273
What's going on here?

267
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:18,553
Got to your classes!

268
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,633
Come, let's go

269
00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:55,353
What?

270
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:56,433
- Show me!
- No!

271
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:57,473
- Show me!
- Silence!

272
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,193
Can't you be quiet?

273
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:10,793
- Show me!
- Leave it!

274
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:11,953
- Give it to me!
- Leave it!

275
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:12,473
Kamali!

276
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:13,913
Kamali, stand up!

277
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:18,793
Ma'am, it was her

278
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:20,273
Valli, stand up!

279
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:21,353
Ma'am she was the one

280
00:24:21,713 --> 00:24:22,553
No ma'am, it was her

281
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:23,313
It was her!

282
00:24:23,353 --> 00:24:23,833
Shut up!

283
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:25,753
Both of you; out of my class!

284
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:42,553
I'll finish you off!

285
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:43,833
Get lost!

286
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:44,353
Hey!

287
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,713
What's in it?

288
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:56,153
Please, show me

289
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,273
I'll tell you something but
promise me you won't laugh

290
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:05,153
I won't. Tell me

291
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:12,113
I'm in love with this boy

292
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:12,753
Good for you!

293
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:14,753
I am too in love with actor Vijay

294
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:17,513
Both are not the same!

295
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:19,553
I'm sincerely and truly
in love with this boy

296
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:21,713
Even my grandma told me...

297
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:24,753
it according to my horoscope in Dharma
Astrology in Vaideswaran temple...

298
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:27,953
I will marry a boy whose name
starts with A and ends with N

299
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:31,193
Why can't it be your uncle's
son from Kumbakonam, Ashokan

300
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:32,953
First letter A and last letter N; AshokaN

301
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:33,913
Get lost!

302
00:25:34,873 --> 00:25:35,953
Shouldn't have told her!

303
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:46,033
How much dowry do you think will be
required to marry that fellow, Ashwin?

304
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:49,153
These boys born in city don't marry
the girl of their parent's choice

305
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:51,193
They fall in love during college and...

306
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,593
introduce her to their
parents later as their fiance

307
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:56,353
How will I reach him? I'm
here and he is over there

308
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:57,473
How is my love going to workout?

309
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:59,473
Do you think he'll come here?
You must go there!

310
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:01,873
Look here, you too are a bright student

311
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:03,473
You look beautiful too

312
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:06,313
Study a little harder
and get good marks...

313
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:08,193
then you can also join IIT.
Simple as that

314
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,633
Do you think I can do it?

315
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:12,833
"I can do it" attitude is what
helped Edison to invent bulb...

316
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,393
and Graham Bell
to invent telephone

317
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,153
Try if you think you can

318
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:19,033
Or marry the groom your
parent's choose for you

319
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:20,873
First letter A and
last letter N; AshokaN

320
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:26,113
Where are you off to?

321
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:29,673
I don't have time to waste.
Got to study! Bye!

322
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:55,633
Mom, why are you too
adding on to my woes?

323
00:26:56,153 --> 00:26:57,313
I am unable to study!

324
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,793
Can't you grind in the flat
rock instead of a mixer?

325
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:02,633
If your focus is on studies
then no noise can disturb you

326
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:05,273
Close your room and study,
if you really want to study

327
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:09,073
Here, stuff your ears
with these cotton balls

328
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,233
Get lost!

329
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:29,673
Physics!

330
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:31,873
A tough one to begin with? No!

331
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:47,473
Chemistry!

332
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:49,193
This is even worse!

333
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:59,113
Present continous, present progressive

334
00:28:01,953 --> 00:28:04,113
Aiyo! English!

335
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:06,273
How am I going to study all these?

336
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:08,913
Valli, Kamali on the phone

337
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:11,473
What's up?

338
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:14,593
You wanted to study but why are
you wasting time calling me up?

339
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:16,793
Stop irritating, I'm already upset!

340
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:18,033
What happened?

341
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:20,833
I frisked all the book
thinking it would be easy

342
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:22,913
Looks like it's going
to be very tough

343
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,393
Do one thing. Join
Subramani teacher's tuition

344
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:27,073
Him?

345
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:28,833
He roughs up his
students real bad!

346
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,913
Pain is a part of love

347
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:32,873
Stop pulling my leg

348
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,713
Let's go there tomorrow.
Will you join me?

349
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:36,713
Do I have a choice? We'll go

350
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:37,393
Ok

351
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:40,473
"Even if the God gives up on you"

352
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,313
"Even if the God gives up on you"

353
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:44,833
"Your will power can give you victory"

354
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,473
"Your will power can give you victory"

355
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:47,753
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

356
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:48,433
You, say it

357
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:51,153
"Even if the God gives up on you!
Your will power can give you pastry"

358
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:52,713
Can give you pastry?

359
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:54,193
Come here!

360
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:56,393
Show me your hands

361
00:28:58,513 --> 00:28:59,353
Say it properly

362
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:01,433
"Even if the God gives up on you"

363
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,953
"Your will power can give you pastry"

364
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,753
Food is always on you mind! Does
it look like I'm running a hotel?

365
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:07,113
Answer properly!

366
00:29:07,153 --> 00:29:08,833
He is very harsh. No need
to join his tuition class!

367
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,433
Do you want to join IIT or not?

368
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:11,553
So, move

369
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:12,633
Keep moving

370
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:14,193
- Did you by-heart it?
- On it, sir

371
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:15,993
- Can you say it properly?
- Yes, sir

372
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:25,353
Why are both the menace here?

373
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:26,793
Why are you guys here?

374
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,953
To join your tuition classes

375
00:29:27,993 --> 00:29:28,593
Both of you?

376
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,553
No! Just her

377
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:30,953
Why all of a sudden?

378
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:34,433
I want to join in IIT. Hence, I
must score good marks. So, I'm here

379
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:36,273
Does your father know this?

380
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:38,313
He isn't someone who is keen
on educating a girl child

381
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:39,153
He knows

382
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:40,993
Looks like he has reformed

383
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,113
But then...

384
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,873
getting into IIT is very difficult

385
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,153
That is why she wants
to join your classes

386
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:47,153
Now, how about that!?

387
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:50,113
I don't know anything about IIT coaching.
I'm a history teacher

388
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:52,433
But then you teach the
12th grade, right?

389
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:54,273
Indeed but I teach history

390
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,753
But then you teach history for
12th grade students, right?

391
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:58,713
Yes but I teach history

392
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,913
Then teach her!

393
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:03,393
I don't those subjects which is why I'm
teaching Thirukural here, you doofus!

394
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:06,593
You must pass two entrance
exams to join IIT

395
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:10,233
Barring your 12th grade marks, the
entrance marks are what matters the most

396
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:13,393
IIT entrance exam is tougher
than NEET exams! Do you know?

397
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:14,953
Then what do I do, sir?

398
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:16,273
Look here...

399
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:19,153
If you really want
to join IIT...

400
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,353
There is a coaching centre named
Aparna Coaching Centre in Tanjavur

401
00:30:22,673 --> 00:30:24,033
Go, join there

402
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:26,593
So you don't know to
teach these subjects?

403
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:27,393
I swear I don't know

404
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:29,073
But you take history
for 12th grade, right?

405
00:30:29,113 --> 00:30:31,153
I'll bash you up! Mind it!

406
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,433
Go, farm animals instead!

407
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:36,193
Why are you showing your teeth?
Did you by-heart it?

408
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,113
They did the same thing
yesterday, fools!

409
00:30:49,153 --> 00:30:50,793
- Look at him!
- He'll never change!

410
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:55,593
Now, take a hike

411
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:58,993
Dude, hold it

412
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:11,993
Sir, I would like to join
IIT entrance coaching class

413
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:15,793
Sir, what happened?

414
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:17,233
Why are you crying, sir?

415
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:18,873
What happened?

416
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,833
It's been two years since I invested 0.5
million and started this Aparna franchise

417
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:28,873
10 students came, inquired and that's it

418
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:31,233
In order to get back my investment...

419
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:34,713
I'm running this franchise teaching
spoken English and computer classes

420
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:36,433
I'll surely join, sir

421
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,313
I can't run the institute just for you

422
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:39,713
Sir...

423
00:31:39,993 --> 00:31:42,033
is there any better institute around?

424
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,713
Yes but then, no!

425
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:47,433
I don't get it, sir

426
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,633
If you really want to
get an admission in IIT

427
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:51,553
There are better institutes in Trichy

428
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,433
Go, try over there

429
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:57,593
Sir, can't we pass the entrance without attending
any coaching classes from such centres?

430
00:31:58,313 --> 00:31:59,393
Good question

431
00:31:59,673 --> 00:32:01,113
I'll give you a brief explanation

432
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,353
Listen to it and then you make a call

433
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,313
Every year at an all India level, more than
10 million students write the 12th grade exam

434
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:12,993
Out of that only 1.5 million brilliant
students write JEE main entrance exam

435
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:14,673
That is 10% of the total

436
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:18,953
Out of that only 0.15 million
students clear this entrance exam

437
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:20,553
That is 10% out of that

438
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:25,353
Only these students are eligible
to write JEE advance IIT entrance

439
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:28,273
Top 10,000 which is the
top 10% of that...

440
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,793
Only they get a seat in IIT college

441
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:33,193
Now, only 1000 out of them...

442
00:32:33,273 --> 00:32:34,633
that is top 10%!

443
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:37,633
Only they get a seat in
an IIT of their choice

444
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:38,313
So...

445
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:42,273
if you an admission in IIT then
you must be one in a million

446
00:32:42,953 --> 00:32:44,873
Can't I make it to IIT?

447
00:32:46,353 --> 00:32:47,873
Even if we want to study...

448
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:49,753
there are no suitable trainers

449
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:52,553
We took birth in this rural village

450
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:55,633
Competing with the students from
the city is a mission impossible

451
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,153
Kamali, wait

452
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,553
Where have you guys been roaming?

453
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:34,953
Remember you told us about the Tanjavur
coaching centre? We had been there

454
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:36,553
Oh! I see

455
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:38,953
What did they say?

456
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:40,673
Don't ask us!

457
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:44,233
No one has an idea about IIT
in this village of fools

458
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:47,193
In fact since no one
joined for IIT entrance...

459
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:49,833
instead they are taking spoken
English classes to earn their living

460
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,273
Why are you hell bent on joining IIT?

461
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:52,993
Love!

462
00:33:54,753 --> 00:33:58,833
Well, sir... nothing... She has
this new found love for IIT

463
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:15,593
Do you know...

464
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:16,913
- Where did she go?
- Sir

465
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:17,953
Oh! There you are

466
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:20,233
- Do you know him?
- No, sir

467
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:21,633
Dr. Arivudai Nambi

468
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:24,353
He was a great professor in
Engineering colleges. Now, retired

469
00:34:24,753 --> 00:34:26,353
His love for his native brought him here

470
00:34:26,913 --> 00:34:28,673
Well, if he trains you...

471
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:30,433
You can make it to IIT

472
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:31,473
Do one thing

473
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:34,673
Why don't you take you father along
and talk to that professor, tomorrow?

474
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,953
Sir, he father can't even
differentiate between ITI and IIT

475
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:40,833
Taking him along won't workout

476
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:43,273
You go along with her and get it done

477
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,833
Is it a must that I should go?

478
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,913
You talk so much but aren't you
interested in higher studies?

479
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:51,473
More than eating, the real
happiness lies in serving others

480
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:53,313
How nicely she put across
that she is bad at studies!

481
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:53,873
Look here...

482
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:57,113
I'll take you to that professor
tomorrow and request him to train you

483
00:34:57,153 --> 00:34:59,233
But I only want you to come.
Don't bring her along

484
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:00,793
You go and serve
food to the poor!

485
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:03,233
Yay!

486
00:35:09,162 --> 00:35:09,642
Dad...

487
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,002
I have tell you something about Kamali

488
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:14,162
What is it?

489
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,562
Well...

490
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:17,842
What is it?

491
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:20,042
Kamali is lying about visiting
Tanjavur to watch a movie

492
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,362
I saw her with a boy. Confront her!

493
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:24,442
Kamali!

494
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:28,802
Yes, dad?

495
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:30,122
Where were you roaming?

496
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:33,362
I went for a movie at Tanjavur

497
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:35,122
I did inform grandma about it

498
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:36,922
Which movie? Ask her dad!

499
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:38,362
Which movie?

500
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,002
Actor Vijay's movie

501
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:41,762
Ask her the show
timing and the theater

502
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,322
Matinee show, Vijaya theater

503
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:46,162
She is lying

504
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:47,882
She wasn't at Vijaya
theater for matinee show

505
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:49,522
But she claims she was there!

506
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:52,322
So, am I lying? I was at Vijaya
theater for the matinee show!

507
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,362
Here's my movie ticket

508
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:55,482
Excuse me!

509
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:58,362
I asked you to pay fees for your
admission in Tutorial college!

510
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:00,762
Instead you go for a movie and
chill out with your friends?

511
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:02,002
Won't you change at all?

512
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:04,642
And he wants to tell on her!

513
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:10,762
You want to know where she
had been to, isn't it?

514
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:14,762
I met Subramani teacher on my way

515
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:16,602
Where did you go?

516
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:18,162
Dad...

517
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:20,642
in order to write IIT entrance...

518
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:24,002
I had been to Aparna coaching
centre to inquire the details

519
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,162
I saw you and Valli along with
a boy neat Olympia centre

520
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:31,562
He was a stranger who helped us with
the route to Aparna coaching centre

521
00:36:48,562 --> 00:36:49,842
Subramani teacher spoke to me

522
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:52,162
He said it is very tough

523
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:54,122
Looks like you must clear
entrance to get there

524
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:58,122
He said "It's Kamali's desire, let her
write the exam and give it a shot"

525
00:36:58,762 --> 00:36:59,802
Do you as you wish

526
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:00,762
Ok?

527
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:02,922
If you clear it, go ahead and study...

528
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,202
or else, as per dad's wish...

529
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,482
you must get married next year.
Sounds good?

530
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:08,242
Ok dad!

531
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:11,762
Yay!

532
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,042
Where are you going for studies?

533
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:15,442
To Tanjavur?

534
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,442
Are you going to travel
so far by bus everyday?

535
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:20,162
Oldie, not in Tanjavur but IIT in Chennai

536
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:22,642
I'll stay in a hostel and study!

537
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,882
Has your father gone nuts?

538
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:26,802
Why would he let a
grown up girl...

539
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:29,442
I was worried if dad would accept to this

540
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:32,882
Now he has agreed to it. Spoil
it and I'll finish you off

541
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,882
Hands off her! Stop showing off!

542
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:37,962
Are you excited that your
father agreed to it?

543
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:39,762
Of course! Have no doubts

544
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,042
He said you may go if you
clear the entrance exam

545
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:47,522
Your dad is so confident that
you won't clear the entrance

546
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:50,682
Which is why, like an
angel he agreed to this

547
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:52,042
You're so innocent!

548
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:55,762
So, there's such a twist in this plot?

549
00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:58,722
Still I like this deal very much!

550
00:38:06,162 --> 00:38:06,642
Sir...

551
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,162
I asked you to come at 9 'O clock

552
00:38:15,522 --> 00:38:19,962
Grandma said "It's good to be early while
going to meet an important person"

553
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:22,122
Being early is fine but a not a day early!

554
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:24,562
Wait, I'll come

555
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:28,882
Why do you look so different?
You're unrecognizable

556
00:38:29,122 --> 00:38:30,282
Too much of make up!

557
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:33,042
Looks like you applied a year
full of make up for just today

558
00:38:33,762 --> 00:38:39,162
Grandma said "It is important to present yourself
well, while meeting an important person"

559
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:49,282
Listen...

560
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:54,242
Discipline?

561
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:56,962
Your activities are quite strange today

562
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:59,082
Nothing of that sort, sir

563
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:04,202
Don't you come in and recite your
grandma's philosophies. Got it?

564
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:06,722
Keep quiet and I'll take care of everything

565
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:12,042
Wonder how I'm going to manage that
Donald Trump with my English knowledge

566
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:22,602
Sitdown

567
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:23,762
It's ok, sir

568
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:24,962
Respect?

569
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:27,682
You have been acting
strange since morning

570
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,002
Nothing of that sort, sir

571
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,242
Yes Subramani, what is the matter?

572
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:54,802
Well sir, this my friend's daughter

573
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:56,282
She studies in our school

574
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:57,522
She's a bright student

575
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:01,122
Well, she aims to join IIT

576
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:05,082
The funny fact is that there are no
proper coaching centres around here

577
00:40:07,122 --> 00:40:08,642
That's why I brought
her here, to you

578
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:09,402
Stop it

579
00:40:10,322 --> 00:40:10,802
Come here

580
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:12,482
- Sir
- Not you. You

581
00:40:34,362 --> 00:40:35,282
She is the rat!

582
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,922
Sir, I thing you've got it wrong

583
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:40,282
She is a very nice girl.
I know her very well

584
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,762
No! No! It's her

585
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:44,762
How dare you appear in front of me?

586
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,602
Do you think I'm an idiot?

587
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:48,402
Get out!

588
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:50,482
Sir, please hear me out. That...

589
00:40:50,562 --> 00:40:53,042
Mr. Subramani, before
I lose my temper...

590
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,882
take her and get the hell out

591
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:55,962
Get out!

592
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:00,162
Fine. Let's leave

593
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:08,482
Yeah, you're spot on with all these!

594
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:09,802
So you are the rat!

595
00:41:10,322 --> 00:41:13,922
You create all the ruckus and how
can you be so innocent and quiet?

596
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:16,602
Sir, you were the one who
asked me to keep quiet

597
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,002
You did a great job. Now, shut up!

598
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,682
Sir, sorry

599
00:41:19,802 --> 00:41:21,762
Please convince him and ask him to train me

600
00:41:21,842 --> 00:41:23,402
You want me to talk to that Trump again?

601
00:41:23,562 --> 00:41:26,002
Look here, if I go meet him again...

602
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:29,482
he will abuse me real bad!

603
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:31,762
This won't work out for me.
I shall do one thing

604
00:41:31,882 --> 00:41:33,442
I shall talk to your dad...

605
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:36,922
and ask him to put you in a Teacher
training or Nursing course

606
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:43,562
It's quiet easy to drive a car

607
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:46,442
Well, I put the first gear but when I
release the clutch the engine turns off

608
00:41:46,482 --> 00:41:48,362
Is it? It's really simple.
Release the clutch slow

609
00:41:48,442 --> 00:41:50,682
The steering is also very tight...

610
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:24,962
Sir, you run so much to
digest the food you consume

611
00:42:25,202 --> 00:42:28,122
Please take some time out
and train that girl, Kamali

612
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,322
I thought you had a good reputation

613
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:33,362
Get lost

614
00:42:37,842 --> 00:42:38,522
Professor!

615
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:41,322
Please come, have a tender coconut

616
00:42:48,562 --> 00:42:51,122
Grown up children are prone
to do mischievous activities

617
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,962
We must appreciate the good part of it.
Instead, why be egoistic?

618
00:42:54,122 --> 00:42:56,082
Please train Kamali

619
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:04,922
Sir...

620
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,922
you're well educated but instead
of living such a lonely life...

621
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:12,282
if you coach that girl, you can
keep yourself also occupied

622
00:43:16,482 --> 00:43:17,602
Fine, ask her to come

623
00:43:18,522 --> 00:43:19,162
Ok, sir

624
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:22,442
Yay!

625
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:35,162
Wait

626
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,322
Is it really him, who asked me to come?
Or are you pushing me in to a mess?

627
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:40,322
I swear, he asked you to come. Come on

628
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,242
Here she is

629
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:44,962
He is upstairs. Go

630
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,002
Go

631
00:43:46,482 --> 00:43:47,322
I said, go

632
00:43:50,842 --> 00:43:51,322
What?

633
00:43:51,322 --> 00:43:53,522
- I'm scared
- Don't be. Just go

634
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:03,322
Sir...

635
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:06,642
The reason I asked you to come is...

636
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:09,322
because I need to apologize to you

637
00:44:09,962 --> 00:44:10,442
Firstly...

638
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,962
For behaving too harsh with you

639
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:15,162
I should've not reacted that way

640
00:44:16,282 --> 00:44:16,842
I'm sorry

641
00:44:17,842 --> 00:44:18,642
Secondly...

642
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:20,282
I need to tell you...

643
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:22,842
I cannot coach you

644
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:24,442
Sorry once again

645
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,042
You may leave

646
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:27,002
But why, sir?

647
00:44:28,162 --> 00:44:30,042
Look here, IIT is not a joke

648
00:44:30,322 --> 00:44:32,522
It requires dedicated hard work

649
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:36,882
On top of all, this isn't an exam where
you can study things by-heart and pass

650
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:39,882
You require a basic
cleverness for this

651
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,082
I don't think you have it in you

652
00:44:43,602 --> 00:44:45,682
And I don't want to waste my time

653
00:45:31,322 --> 00:45:33,042
That... was here

654
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:38,082
You know chess?

655
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:39,082
A little bit

656
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:40,122
Sit

657
00:46:16,122 --> 00:46:16,962
Smart move

658
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:27,522
Sir, check mate!

659
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:32,322
Brilliant! You trapped me

660
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:34,282
Where did you learn?

661
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:36,082
I learnt it myself

662
00:46:37,082 --> 00:46:37,562
Good

663
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,802
What's your name?

664
00:46:40,082 --> 00:46:40,722
Kamali

665
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,802
Come tomorrow morning
at 7 'O clock

666
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:45,962
Sir, to play chess?

667
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:48,762
Your coaching starts tomorrow

668
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:51,122
Thank you, sir

669
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:04,642
JEE problems...

670
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:06,642
Chemistry, Mathematics....

671
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:09,042
Mom...

672
00:47:09,282 --> 00:47:10,482
Who brought these books?

673
00:47:10,682 --> 00:47:11,522
Your brother

674
00:47:11,882 --> 00:47:14,122
Out of the blue he has this
new found love on his sister

675
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:20,322
From did his highness get so much money?

676
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:21,282
Visalatchi!

677
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:23,402
My earring are missing!

678
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:54,807
Sorry, sir. My watch is five minutes slow

679
00:47:54,927 --> 00:47:56,287
Then set your time right

680
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:59,607
You're in a race. Now time is everything

681
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:03,007
Sit

682
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:09,367
Sir, are these books enough or
should I buy any other book?

683
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:12,087
These aren't books but a guide

684
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:15,927
I am here to guide you

685
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:21,887
Study this chart and come

686
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:25,367
Sir...

687
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:27,967
I know the alphabets very well

688
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:30,127
Do what I say

689
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:32,247
Ok, sir

690
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:50,687
Grandma!

691
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:52,727
Watch out! Careful! She might fall

692
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:55,607
Here, study the alphabets.
You got a test tomorrow

693
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,527
I don't get it

694
00:49:03,047 --> 00:49:03,647
Hello...

695
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:06,047
Uncle, it's me, Kamali.
Where is Valli?

696
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:08,567
It's Kamali

697
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:11,207
Hello

698
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:14,687
How is the professor's class?
Easy or tough?

699
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:17,607
Tough? Turns out
he is a funny guy

700
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:18,727
What do you mean?

701
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:21,207
I went today morning for class and
he gave me an alphabets chart

702
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:23,927
He asked me to study it and says
tomorrow he'll give me a test

703
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:27,047
What? Looks like he is a crackpot

704
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:28,807
Was it for this we struggled so hard?

705
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:29,727
Now what?

706
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,127
Wait and watch. Tomorrow,
I'll teach him a lesson

707
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:41,447
Sir, sharp 7 'O clock

708
00:49:41,647 --> 00:49:42,127
Good!

709
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:43,887
So, did you study?

710
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:48,207
Yes. I studied throughout
night, without sleep at all

711
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:49,687
Good. Sit down

712
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:54,647

00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:00,887
Now say it from Z to A

717
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:10,327

718
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:12,847

00:50:14,927 --> 00:50:16,007

00:50:18,287 --> 00:50:21,527
A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J...L,M,N,O,P

721
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:22,647

Stop

725
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:33,047
Hours of learning doesn't matter...

726
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:35,767
What matters is
the way you learn

727
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,567
Go, concentrate, study well
and come back tomorrow

728
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:40,687
Go now

729
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,167
I'm talking to you

730
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:06,007
A for 1, B for 2, C for
3, D for 4, E for 5...

731
00:51:06,047 --> 00:51:07,767
- Kamali, Valli is on the line

732
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:09,047
Hello

733
00:51:09,247 --> 00:51:11,247
So, did you teach him a lesson?

734
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:17,007
How dare you disrespect a
great professor like him?

735
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:19,847
What's your story? Keeps
having new twists everyday!

736
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,687
I got to prepare for tomorrow's test.
Now, hang up!

737
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:27,967
Studies and confusion go hand in hand!

738
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,647
I better stay alert!

739
00:51:29,807 --> 00:51:33,687
A for 1, B for 2, C for
3, D for 4, E for 5...

00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:34,607
J for 10...

741
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:38,127
She wanted me to learn alphabets
yesterday and now look at her!

742
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:43,007
Are you ready?

743
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:44,047
Yes, sir

744
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:45,047

00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:49,887

00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,127

Good. Ok

750
00:52:17,407 --> 00:52:18,527
Sir, 557?

751
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:20,807
Right

752
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,127
Sir, 440

753
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,327
Now you understand

754
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,367
But you're taking a little too long

755
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:54,207
Go home, practice well
and come back tomorrow

756
00:52:54,407 --> 00:52:55,327
Ok, sir

757
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:45,847
Kamali

758
00:53:46,487 --> 00:53:47,807
- What is it?
- Valli on line

759
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:49,767
Tell her I'm not at home

760
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:55,647
Looks like she is not at home.
Guess, she stepped outside

761
00:53:55,927 --> 00:53:57,287
So? She is studying?

762
00:53:58,087 --> 00:53:58,967
How did you guess it?

763
00:53:59,847 --> 00:54:01,367
I am her friend!

764
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:09,367
Morning, sir

765
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:14,607
Did you practice well?

766
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:15,767
Sit down

767
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:19,847
There are 10 questions on the board

768
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:21,647
You got 10 minutes

769
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:22,887
- Ok, sir
- Do it

770
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:24,887
Your time starts now

771
00:54:58,207 --> 00:54:59,407
- Sir! Sir! Five more minutes please
- Your time is up!

772
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:00,967
Please give me five more minutes

773
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,647
Can you say the same
in your exam hall?

774
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:11,167
Your answers are right

775
00:55:11,447 --> 00:55:13,647
But you've answered only six questions

776
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:14,807
It's ok

777
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:23,007
Here, have some tea

778
00:55:31,807 --> 00:55:33,487
So, what did you learn in these three days?

779
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:38,287
First day, my purpose was
to make you concentrate

780
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:41,407
Concentrate

781
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:44,847
Next day, it was to make you
understand the subject

782
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:47,607
Understand

783
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:50,767
Third day, it was to make you practice

784
00:55:52,487 --> 00:55:53,247
Practice

785
00:55:54,327 --> 00:55:54,887
See now...

786
00:55:55,527 --> 00:56:00,207
Today you were able to answer six
out of 10 questions in 10 minutes

787
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:05,767
If you understand well and practice more...

788
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:09,407
You can answer all the questions
within the given time

789
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,207
IIT entrance is as simple as that

790
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:16,807
The count of students who're
writing this entrance...

791
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:19,167
and how many are clearing it...

792
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:20,847
You don't have to
worry about all that

793
00:56:23,327 --> 00:56:24,567
In the exam hall...

794
00:56:25,527 --> 00:56:27,127
You'll have a question paper in your hands

795
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:29,847
There will be 90 questions in it

796
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,447
You'll be give 180 minutes to solve it

797
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:35,527
Two minutes to solve each question

798
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:40,887
How many out of those questions will you be
able to answer correctly is what matters

799
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:46,167
All the questions will be
from the subjects you got

800
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:51,767
So, don't be negligent like
you were with the alphabets

801
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:57,727
You must concentrate well and
study all the chapters very well

802
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,607
The practice again and
again what you've studied

803
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:05,887
Are you wondering "Then
what am I doing here?"

804
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:08,207
Only exams

805
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:11,607
Stage by stage. Chapter by chapter

806
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,927
Every alternate day
you'll have your exams

807
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:16,207
One day exam

808
00:57:16,887 --> 00:57:18,527
Next day, I'll clear your doubts

809
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:19,527
Ok, sir

810
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:24,247
Approximately there are 300 days
to go for you entrance exam

811
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:29,807
So, by then you would given the

814
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:37,247
So, you won't have

00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:40,727
You can do it within the time

817
00:57:41,807 --> 00:57:43,007
You get what I'm saying?

818
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:44,287
Yes, sir

819
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:46,647
Now, I'm going to give
you a mantra to succeed

820
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:48,247
How did you drink your tea?

821
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:49,967
In a cup

822
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,727
So, to taste your tea
you need a cup, right?

823
00:57:54,447 --> 00:57:55,967
So, to taste your success...

824
00:58:01,407 --> 00:58:02,367
here's your cup!

825
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,847
This cup is going to be your mantra

826
00:58:06,447 --> 00:58:06,927
"C"

827
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:10,127
Concentrate in your class

828
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:10,887
"U"

829
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:12,927
Understand the subjects

830
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:14,007
"P"

831
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:15,807
Practice everyday

832
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:18,607
Never, ever forget this mantra

833
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:22,207
From tomorrow your exam starts here

834
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:23,647
You can go now

835
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:24,247
Sir...

836
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:25,967
Can I have this cup for myself?

837
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:27,367
Sorry...

838
00:58:27,887 --> 00:58:28,847
Can I have this mantra?

839
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:29,647
Sure

840
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:44,847
"As the heart blossoms..."

841
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:51,527
"I can feel you in my heart"

842
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:55,127
"All my thoughts, each and every day..."

843
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:58,047
No matter how much gold
they demand in dowry...

844
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,247
we must marry off my grand daughter
to a well educated boy like him

845
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:07,007
"When the love thoughts start
to rain, it makes me feel shy..."

846
00:59:07,607 --> 00:59:12,247
"like the water that
shines on the leaves"

847
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:17,567
"The fragrance of the feather
that the birds shed..."

848
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:23,087
"it's so nostalgic that it
blends love into my soul"

849
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:28,367
"And I see you in my dreams..."

850
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:32,887
"where your eyes shine like the stars"

851
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:38,567
"In your heart..."

852
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:45,047
"is where I would like you be.
I wish! It's all I wish!"

853
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:50,447
"Every word I read talks to me"

854
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:55,647
"And it meets my expectations
every single time"

855
00:59:55,687 --> 01:00:05,527
"Though we aren't around each other,
I feel we are still connected"

856
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:11,767
"As the heart blossoms..."

857
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:18,847
"I can feel you in my heart"

858
01:00:19,287 --> 01:00:22,247
"All my thoughts, each and every day..."

859
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:29,007
"is about you and it fulfils all my desire"

860
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:56,687
Hey! You have cleared
the main entrance!

861
01:00:58,847 --> 01:01:00,607
The advance will be even more
tougher than the main exam

862
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:03,247
- You have to concentrate more
- Ok, sir

863
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:21,287
"I can feel myself changing"

864
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:24,247
Ashwin! Come here, dear

865
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:25,247
Ashwin!

866
01:01:26,647 --> 01:01:28,527
Eat first! Then you can
go out and play. Come

867
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:31,207
"I'm lost in the breeze that
carries the love scent"

868
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:36,807
"As I slowly become yours"

869
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:44,447
"The long roads make me more desperate"

870
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:46,207
Love you! Love you, mom!

871
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:51,047
"With tear of hapiness in my
eyes, as I look at you..."

872
01:01:52,327 --> 01:01:55,407
"I forget the desperation
and feel re-energized"

873
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:56,687
I love you, ma!

874
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:02,247
"Even though you are so
far away from me..."

875
01:02:02,527 --> 01:02:06,527
"my love will find you"

876
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:09,807
"As the heart blossoms..."

877
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:16,687
"I can feel you in my heart"

878
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:20,327
"All my thoughts, each and every day..."

879
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:27,487
"is about you and it fulfils all my desire"

880
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:33,007
I got my hall ticket

881
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:35,007
JEE advance entrance

882
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:37,047
The exam centre is in Pondicherry

883
01:02:37,127 --> 01:02:38,567
I'm going tomorrow with my dad

884
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:58,567
"I can hear the voice of my heart so clear"

885
01:03:00,807 --> 01:03:02,247
Were you awake
throughout the night?

886
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:08,847
"The flowers are blossoming
on one direction..."

887
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:14,247
"but I'm running towards
the opposite direction"

888
01:03:14,327 --> 01:03:23,727
"Desires that fall like the
lightning on the water..."

889
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:29,047
"that is what I'm
yearning to catch here"

890
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:31,727
No, thanks dad. I'm getting late

891
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:33,287
- At least have this juice
- Later, dad

892
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:39,647
"The day I will feel your touch..."

893
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:43,967
"is the day my dreams will come true"

894
01:03:44,207 --> 01:03:47,207
"As the heart blossoms..."

895
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:50,047
In this question paper...

896
01:03:50,087 --> 01:03:51,167
Excuse me, miss...

897
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:57,367
Please maintain disciple. This
is the JEE advance examination

898
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,967
I have a small doubt with
regards to the question paper

899
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:02,487
What's your doubt? You want
the answer to the questions?

900
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:24,047
Sir...

901
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,287
Where is Kamali?

902
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:26,407
She is right next to me

903
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:27,607
I'll give the phone to her

904
01:04:28,127 --> 01:04:28,607
Dear...

905
01:04:30,047 --> 01:04:31,047
Nambi sir on the call

906
01:04:31,607 --> 01:04:34,447
No matter what, just say you
wrote the exam well. Ok?

907
01:04:36,687 --> 01:04:37,167
Hello

908
01:04:37,527 --> 01:04:38,487
Sir, Kamali here

909
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:40,767
How did you do the exam?

910
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:42,487
Sir, I have done it really well

911
01:04:42,607 --> 01:04:45,407
Most of the questions were from
the tests you had given me

912
01:04:45,727 --> 01:04:48,087
Electromagnetism, wave optics from Physics

913
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:51,247
Isomerism, name theory from Chemistry

914
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:52,207
And in Mathematics...

915
01:04:52,247 --> 01:04:53,887
Ok, ok... Relax

916
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:56,527
I'm sure you'd have done it well

917
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,367
If you secure a rank within top 1000...

918
01:04:59,447 --> 01:05:01,647
then you can choose good
courses in IIT, Madras

919
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:04,487
Don't think about anything
until results are out

920
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:05,967
Just go chill out. Ok?

921
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:07,767
Ok, sir

922
01:05:16,487 --> 01:05:16,967
Here

923
01:05:18,687 --> 01:05:21,287
Why are you sporting a long face?
Didn't you do your exams well?

924
01:05:21,607 --> 01:05:22,807
I have done it very well

925
01:05:23,807 --> 01:05:24,447
Yeah right!

926
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:26,967
What's the big deal even
if she hadn't done it well?

927
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,727
I understand that she
is acting bit crazy

928
01:05:28,927 --> 01:05:30,727
But this jobless fellow?
He supports her!

929
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:42,447
(Chanting mantras)

930
01:05:44,127 --> 01:05:46,047
Are your results out tomorrow?

931
01:05:47,207 --> 01:05:49,087
Enough. Lord Pillayar
might catch cold

932
01:05:49,647 --> 01:05:51,687
Don't jinx it. Just leave!

933
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:53,527
All the best

934
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,007
Wow! Amazing!

935
01:06:05,847 --> 01:06:06,927
- Lakshmi!
- Sir?

936
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:08,727
- Sir...
- What happened, sir?

937
01:06:09,247 --> 01:06:11,727
Kamali has cleared the exam
and secured a good rank!

938
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:14,367
232nd rank!

939
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:18,447
Just 232nd, right? You are excited
as if she got the first rank!

940
01:06:18,567 --> 01:06:19,807
Dumbo! Dumbo!

941
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:25,047
You've no idea how great it is to achieve 232nd
rank in IIT entrance at an all India level

942
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:26,687
You will never understand

943
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:31,567
Sir!

944
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:35,847
You surprise me

945
01:06:36,487 --> 01:06:39,887
232 in all India level? It's really great!

946
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:42,607
So, as you wished...

947
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:45,127
you'll get seat in IIT, Madras

948
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:46,567
Thank you, sir

949
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:48,727
Actually, I must thank you

950
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:50,247
All the best

951
01:06:51,447 --> 01:06:52,727
Go, chase your dream

952
01:06:53,327 --> 01:06:54,287
Thank you, sir

953
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:04,087
- Careful! - Kamali, come quick!
- Coming!

954
01:07:05,327 --> 01:07:06,567
- Keep it in the trunk
- Ok, grandma

955
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:08,807
Packed everything. Hope you
didn't forget anything

956
01:07:08,847 --> 01:07:09,607
No! No!

957
01:07:09,887 --> 01:07:11,807
Eat on time and take
care of your health

958
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:12,407
Ok, mom!

959
01:07:12,447 --> 01:07:14,007
- Get good friends circle
- Ok, mom

960
01:07:14,087 --> 01:07:15,047
Ok?

961
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:15,887
All the best

962
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:16,647
Get lost!

963
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:18,087
Here you go, dear. Keep this

964
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,727
It's ok, grandma. I
have enough with me

965
01:07:19,807 --> 01:07:22,607
Keep it. Buy something health to eat
with this. Take care of yourself

966
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:26,767
It's getting late!

967
01:07:27,007 --> 01:07:28,727
Daddy, we're getting late.
We'll miss the train

968
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:29,767
Did you bid good bye to sir?

969
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:30,927
- Bye, sir
- Ok, all the best

970
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:31,887
- See you, sir
- Ok, Shanmugam

971
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,447
Come

972
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:36,447
Look how eagerly Kamali has set off to do
her higher studies. Then there is you!

973
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:38,927
I know how eager she
is and for what

974
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:40,207
Why are you confusing me?

975
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:43,007
I'm giving a clear explanation
but you are unable to crack it

976
01:07:43,047 --> 01:07:43,967
Bye grandma

977
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:45,567
- Ok, best of luck
- Thank you, sir

978
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:46,567
Best wishes!

979
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,447
- See you, sir
- Ok, Shanmugam

980
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,087
Drive

981
01:07:52,127 --> 01:07:52,967
- All the best
- Bye

982
01:08:50,981 --> 01:08:51,981
Fill in the entry time

983
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:55,781
Wrote down the vehicle number?

984
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,261
Yes? Fresher?

985
01:08:59,341 --> 01:09:00,181
- She is here to join
- Yes

986
01:09:00,341 --> 01:09:03,101
You'll have to travel a bit. Please
wait, the campus bus will be here

987
01:09:03,421 --> 01:09:04,021
Ok

988
01:09:12,421 --> 01:09:13,821
A bus to travel
inside the college?

989
01:09:14,501 --> 01:09:16,061
Looks like you've got
into a big college

990
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:14,501
Saravathi hostel

991
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:16,101
Room #308

992
01:10:16,661 --> 01:10:18,501
The rooms are ok. Not bad

993
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:20,621
Honey, you sound still worried

994
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:22,941
Don't piss me off, mom. I've
told you from the beginning...

995
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:25,661
that coaching centre is not good!
You never listen to me

996
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:29,101
Child! They are the best
coaching centre in the city

997
01:10:29,461 --> 01:10:31,741
You know how much it cost
me to get you there?

998
01:10:31,821 --> 01:10:34,021
I know! It cost my Computer ambition

999
01:10:34,061 --> 01:10:37,181
With a rank above 1000, here I am
about to do my Chemical engineering

1000
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:40,261
You did get a Computer seat in
IIT, Guwahati for your rank

1001
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:41,701
But you didn't want to go there

1002
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:44,781
You're a sentimental
idiot, just like your dad!

1003
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:46,781
One second, mom

1004
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,501
Mom, I'll call you later

1005
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:55,341
Looks like a new trouble!

1006
01:10:55,621 --> 01:10:57,981
Looks like I might end up with
a country girl as my roommate

1007
01:10:58,021 --> 01:10:59,021
I'll talk to you. Bye. Bye

1008
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,021
Hi

1009
01:11:01,301 --> 01:11:02,221
- Hi
- I'm Kamali

1010
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:03,341
And you are?

1011
01:11:03,461 --> 01:11:03,941
Nethra

1012
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:05,141
My dad

1013
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:06,021
Hi uncle

1014
01:11:15,101 --> 01:11:16,261
You've achieved your dream

1015
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:19,461
Sentiment!

1016
01:11:20,421 --> 01:11:20,901
Here

1017
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:24,941
You might have lot of expenses here

1018
01:11:25,421 --> 01:11:26,861
Don't you worry at all

1019
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:28,261
Spend as you wish

1020
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:30,981
I'll deposit money every
month into your account

1021
01:11:31,061 --> 01:11:31,541
Ok?

1022
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:32,941
How about some fun?

1023
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:34,461
Well, Kamali...

1024
01:11:34,781 --> 01:11:35,621
What rank did you get?

1025
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:37,261
232nd rank

1026
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:39,141
Come again

1027
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:41,261
"232"

1028
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:43,261
Which department?

1029
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:44,821
Computer Science

1030
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:46,781
My God!

1031
01:11:47,381 --> 01:11:48,581
I can't believe this

1032
01:11:49,061 --> 01:11:50,101
So, what rank did you get?

1033
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:53,941
I got to take this call... So...

1034
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,981
- Hello
- Hey honey, what happened?

1035
01:12:02,061 --> 01:12:04,741
I'm pissed off to the core!
Call me later!

1036
01:12:10,061 --> 01:12:11,781
Nethra, my dad's leaving

1037
01:12:11,981 --> 01:12:12,661
See you, dear

1038
01:12:13,301 --> 01:12:14,101
Bye uncle

1039
01:12:17,981 --> 01:12:19,301
It's a new place. So be careful

1040
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:20,741
- Ok, dad

01:12:20,781 --> 01:12:21,501
- Ok?

1042
01:12:21,741 --> 01:12:22,861
Study well and achieve your goals

1043
01:12:22,861 --> 01:12:24,021
- Ok dad, the bus is here
- See you

1044
01:12:24,101 --> 01:12:25,861
- You start, dad
- Ok. See you

01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:29,461
Do call us regularly.
Don't forget

1046

Ok, daddy

1047
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:47,941
I'm Nethra and you?

Your from?

1049
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:04,621
I made it to IIT, Guwahati

1050
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:08,341
I got computers as well there but...

1051
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:10,981
- Hi Nethra
- You know, right?

1052
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:14,701
So, the ranking here, I like it better

1053
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:19,101
I also like the infrastructure
here and the faculties also

1054
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:25,141
So, did you do any research about them?

1055
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:26,341
Yeah

1056
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:30,061
Yeah

1057
01:13:31,181 --> 01:13:33,061
I've already started
getting a few books

1058
01:13:37,701 --> 01:13:39,341
I think, I'll have to leave. Bye

1059
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:52,741
Why did you leave me behind?

1060
01:13:52,901 --> 01:13:53,741
You were not there

1061
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:56,901
Fine. Starting tomorrow,
let's come together

1062
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:58,501
Ok

1063
01:14:00,021 --> 01:14:01,301
232nd rank, right?

1064
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:03,661
Which coaching centre did you study in?

1065
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:05,101
- Well, that...
- FIITJEE or Bansal?

1066
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:05,981
Resonance?

1067
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:06,981
No

1068
01:14:07,301 --> 01:14:09,381
There are no good coaching
centres in our village

1069
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:11,621
A retired professor,
Mr. Nambi...

1070
01:14:12,021 --> 01:14:13,101
He coached me

1071
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:14,461
Really?

1072
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:17,181
So, you started coaching
from 10th standard?

1073
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:18,701
No! Not at all

1074
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:20,141
It was in 12th grade...

1075
01:14:20,901 --> 01:14:22,621
I decided I want to join IIT

1076
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:25,461
Before that I wasn't much
interested in studies

1077
01:14:27,741 --> 01:14:29,381
Henceforth, we are roommates

1078
01:14:30,061 --> 01:14:31,021
And so...

1079
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:33,941
I'll just tell you alone my secret

1080
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:36,821
I...

1081
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:39,941
I'm in love with a boy

1082
01:14:43,221 --> 01:14:44,341
It is to meet him...

1083
01:14:45,021 --> 01:14:47,101
I studied hard and got into IIT

1084
01:14:47,341 --> 01:14:47,821
Is it?

1085
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:49,061
Who's the guy?

1086
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:51,021
I haven't confessed my love to him yet

1087
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:53,461
Once I propose him, then I
promise, I'll tell you first

1088
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:55,581
He knows you?

1089
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:58,381
He will know me

1090
01:15:00,821 --> 01:15:01,741
My God!

1091
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:03,661
I can't believe this!

1092
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:19,901
I love Rihanna

1093
01:15:19,941 --> 01:15:21,741
Do you ever listen to Indian albums?

1094
01:15:21,781 --> 01:15:23,301
Look at your roommate!

1095
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:26,021
Nice dress

1096
01:15:26,821 --> 01:15:27,541
All the best

1097
01:15:28,101 --> 01:15:28,821
Thank you

1098
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:34,741
You just said "All the best"
but why did she blush for it?

1099
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:38,261
There is a Cinderella story behind
her blushing. Come, I'll tell you

1100
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:12,581
- Excuse me
- Yeah?

1101
01:16:12,621 --> 01:16:13,661
Can I sit there?

1102
01:16:14,061 --> 01:16:14,861
I'm sorry, what?

1103
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:16,261
Window side

1104
01:16:17,141 --> 01:16:17,941
Yeah, sure

1105
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:20,261
Thanks

1106
01:17:36,941 --> 01:17:38,701
Please stop the bus! Stop the bus!

1107
01:18:07,501 --> 01:18:08,861
Uh-oh! I'm running
late for class!

1108
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:10,701
Good morning, everybody

1109
01:18:12,581 --> 01:18:13,741
Welcome to IIT

1110
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:16,821
My name is K.R. Srinivasan

1111
01:18:17,341 --> 01:18:20,541
More than one million
people try and get here

1112
01:18:20,981 --> 01:18:25,621
But only the top 500 get to
sit where you're sitting

1113
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:27,221
Be proud!

1114
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:29,141
You're among the best!

1115
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:32,981
But that, ladies and
gentlemen, is the easy part

1116
01:18:34,301 --> 01:18:36,381
The tough part is yet to begin

1117
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:39,981
73 people were out in the first year...

1118
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:43,501
because they failed
in both the semesters

1119
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:47,261
If you don't do well, you're out of IIT

1120
01:18:47,741 --> 01:18:48,221
Period!

1121
01:18:48,621 --> 01:18:52,141
So, from now on, don't
miss classes, quizzes...

1122
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:54,821
deadlines and don't
miss guest lectures

1123
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:55,821
And...

1124
01:18:57,341 --> 01:19:00,181
you never ever come
late to my classes!

1125
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:01,261
Sorry, sir

1126
01:19:01,501 --> 01:19:01,981
Get in

1127
01:19:08,181 --> 01:19:10,981
When you're here,
you need to be here

1128
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:12,781
Focused!

1129
01:19:13,141 --> 01:19:14,021
Is that clear?

1130
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:16,421
Do I hear a yes?

1131
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:17,341
Yes, sir

1132
01:19:18,301 --> 01:19:18,781
Good!

1133
01:19:19,141 --> 01:19:19,861
I like that

1134
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,341
Now, let's get on
with the subject

1135
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:26,781
Today we'll talk about
differential equations

1136
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:29,821
And how that applies to our subject

1137
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:32,501
We will take the independent...

1138
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:34,461
Can I help you with something?

1139
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:39,941
Are you... Are you sure?

1140
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:43,301
Thank you

1141
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:44,301
Ok

1142
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:52,941
"An unknown breeze gently caresses me"

1143
01:20:53,141 --> 01:20:57,301
"I can feel love blossoming in my heart"

1144
01:20:57,981 --> 01:21:02,061
"If you come along and hold my hands..."

1145
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:06,661
"all my shyness will fly away"

1146
01:21:06,861 --> 01:21:09,101
"You caught me when I was about to fall"

1147
01:21:09,221 --> 01:21:11,261
"You laughed when I was all teared up"

1148
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:13,501
"And when I got up, you hugged me"

1149
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:16,101
"With a smile that
resembled mother's love"

1150
01:21:16,221 --> 01:21:20,621
"The heart sings the tune
to the lyric of the life"

1151
01:21:21,061 --> 01:21:24,261
"That resulted in the dance called 'Love' "

1152
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:45,741
Now, I invite Ashwin. The
students coordinator

1153
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:52,461
Thank you, Preethi

1154
01:21:52,661 --> 01:21:53,621
Good morning, everyone

1155
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:58,141
"I imagined you as a
friend, as a guardian..."

1156
01:21:58,301 --> 01:22:02,341
"I imagined you as what not, still
there is a lot of imagination left"

1157
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:06,861
"I'm not so brave to say
those three words..."

1158
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:10,741
"but the beauty lies in you
saying those words to me"

1159
01:22:11,741 --> 01:22:16,261
"The moon in my dreams
splits into small stars..."

1160
01:22:16,461 --> 01:22:20,181
"and you are all I see in all those stars"

1161
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:24,861
"The mystery of this relationship!
The unrevealed face"

1162
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:28,781
"The beauty lies in them
solving on its own"

1163
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:32,141
"With your smartness and
the macho voice..."

1164
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:34,821
"and with that look of yours,
you're drawing me towards you"

1165
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:39,101
"Yes, you attract me towards you"

1166
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:43,701
"As our shadows dance a duet..."

1167
01:22:43,781 --> 01:22:47,861
"That resulted in the dance called 'Love' "

1168
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:52,381
"That resulted in the dance called 'Love' "

1169
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:15,741
"If your eyes are the subject..."

1170
01:23:16,061 --> 01:23:20,461
"I would study it round the clock"

1171
01:23:20,701 --> 01:23:25,021
"If your words flow like the water..."

1172
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:29,301
"then my heart will be the cup
that will never overflow"

1173
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:33,621
"I can't hear anything else as time has frozen
in my world and no one's here to talk to me"

1174
01:23:33,741 --> 01:23:36,781
"No fragrance as there is no breeze. Well, in
this dream world, I don't need to breathe"

1175
01:23:36,821 --> 01:23:39,141
"I experience all this in a world with you"

1176
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,421
"I don't feel like praying
because I don't feel like"

1177
01:23:41,501 --> 01:23:42,781
"I can't find myself"

1178
01:23:42,861 --> 01:23:44,941
"All I need is you to be with me forever"

1179
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:48,261
"All I want is to melt in your love. That's
all I need in my life. What's wrong with it?"

1180
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:56,861
"You are like a thousand skies..."

1181
01:23:57,421 --> 01:24:01,781
which one do I step in to?"

1182
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:05,941
"You tell me"

1183
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:15,261
"You showered love upon
me like a thousand skies"

1184
01:24:15,901 --> 01:24:24,181
"I've already fallen in love, will
you too fall in love any soon?"

1185
01:24:24,861 --> 01:24:27,061
"You caught me when I was about to fall"

1186
01:24:27,141 --> 01:24:29,421
"You laughed when I was all teared up"

1187
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,621
"And when I got up, you hugged me"

1188
01:24:31,741 --> 01:24:33,981
"With a smile that
resembled mother's love"

1189
01:24:34,181 --> 01:24:38,661
"The heart sings the tune
to the lyric of the life"

1190
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,701
"That resulted in the dance called 'Love' "

1191
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:47,541
"That resulted in the dance called 'Love' "

1192
01:25:06,861 --> 01:25:07,981
You should also try it

1193
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:12,301
Hey, why are you laughing?

1194
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:15,621
Nothing. Cinderella’s going
overboard with her love activities

1195
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:19,541
Who is that Cinderella?

1196
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:22,381
A crackpot. I'll tell
you about her later

1197
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:24,701
You tell me

1198
01:25:43,621 --> 01:25:44,981
Before going in to the subject

1199
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:48,421
I want to say 'Hello' to one VIP...

1200
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:51,941
who has failed all the
subjects in our class

1201
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:54,261
Kamali!

1202
01:25:59,341 --> 01:26:01,141
Kamali, you came here with good rank

1203
01:26:01,501 --> 01:26:03,941
But you just don't seem to
have got the hang of things

1204
01:26:04,741 --> 01:26:05,741
What's your problem?

1205
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,221
Please say something. I'm asking you

1206
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:12,101
She is not here to study, sir

1207
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:14,261
Cinderella came in
search of her prince

1208
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:21,221
Do you remember what I told
you in the first class?

1209
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:25,901
That you don't get through IIT by
messing around and roaming around

1210
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:27,621
This is IIT

1211
01:26:28,341 --> 01:26:29,661
Do you know what you're missing?

1212
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:34,301
I want you to meet me in
my room after the class

1213
01:26:48,941 --> 01:26:52,141
You don't seem to have understood
the value of this place

1214
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:53,941
Get your priorities right

1215
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:55,581
I hope you understand

1216
01:26:55,861 --> 01:26:58,581
Next time you won't
get another chance

1217
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:27,701
Cinderella, don't just give up

1218
01:27:28,021 --> 01:27:31,141
Who cares about backlogs? Love is
what matters the most. All the best

1219
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,701
So, I am that Cinderella, right?

1220
01:28:28,172 --> 01:28:29,932
Oh my God! It's 12:30

1221
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:35,012
Order please

1222
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:37,252
Coffee

1223
01:29:48,732 --> 01:29:51,372
It's a nice place to have
coffee and a nice time as well

1224
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:53,612
- This girl likes only coffees and toffees
- Don't try too hard

1225
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:54,612
I'll buy you a coffee

1226
01:30:02,812 --> 01:30:03,292
Dude...

1227
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:05,852
Do you know who that girl is?

1228
01:30:08,332 --> 01:30:09,452
The cupex girl dude

1229
01:30:10,292 --> 01:30:11,612
Who cupped in all her subjects

1230
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:13,932
The Cinderella of our campus

1231
01:30:14,612 --> 01:30:16,412
But who is this great prince?

1232
01:30:16,852 --> 01:30:19,652
Right now this is the million
dollar question in our college

1233
01:30:19,692 --> 01:30:20,172
Who knows?

1234
01:30:20,732 --> 01:30:21,732
It could be him

1235
01:30:21,892 --> 01:30:23,812
It could be him or it could be you too

1236
01:30:24,892 --> 01:30:27,572
Definitely I'm not that joker

1237
01:30:29,932 --> 01:30:30,972
Hey, what are we eating?

1238
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:51,052
What happened?

1239
01:30:53,652 --> 01:30:54,452
What's wrong?

1240
01:30:56,252 --> 01:30:57,292
What is it, Kamali?

1241
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:02,412
What are you doing?

1242
01:31:10,732 --> 01:31:11,972
I'm asking you

1243
01:31:12,692 --> 01:31:14,132
Where are you leaving at this hour?

1244
01:31:16,572 --> 01:31:17,652
Kamali, please!

1245
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:50,652
Your stop is here

1246
01:32:07,692 --> 01:32:10,412
Early to bed and early to rise must be
the habit. Only then in the morning...

1247
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:14,732
...you can wake up and study. Whatever you
study at early morning will stay in memory

1248
01:32:14,772 --> 01:32:15,892
Got it?

1249
01:32:16,572 --> 01:32:22,932
Wandering around, doing thug activities
without studying is not acceptable at all

1250
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:26,492
So, focus on studies and
remember what I said

1251
01:32:34,772 --> 01:32:37,772
- Then - A detergent soap, 100 ml
coconut oil and for two rupees...

1252
01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:41,612
Kamali!

1253
01:32:42,292 --> 01:32:44,612
What's with the surprise visit?

1254
01:32:46,572 --> 01:32:47,612
Are you here on holidays?

1255
01:32:48,132 --> 01:32:51,292
You could've called at least once
in a while. Are you so busy?

1256
01:32:51,812 --> 01:32:53,252
Well, can't blame you

1257
01:32:53,452 --> 01:32:55,972
You must be occupied full
time in stalking Ashwin

1258
01:32:56,092 --> 01:32:58,052
So, did it workout? Tell me!

1259
01:32:59,172 --> 01:33:00,132
Shut up!

1260
01:33:00,812 --> 01:33:02,252
Hey! What happened?

1261
01:33:06,812 --> 01:33:07,532
What happened?

1262
01:33:08,092 --> 01:33:09,212
Any problem?

1263
01:33:09,772 --> 01:33:11,172
Can't you even share it with me?

1264
01:33:11,412 --> 01:33:13,212
You're my problem right now!
Just shut up!

1265
01:33:13,772 --> 01:33:15,052
Visalatchi!

1266
01:33:15,212 --> 01:33:18,692
I told you yesterday that Kamali came
in my dream and look here she comes

1267
01:33:19,972 --> 01:33:21,932
Hey! What's with the surprise visit?

1268
01:33:22,052 --> 01:33:23,092
Shouldn't I come home?

1269
01:33:26,412 --> 01:33:27,892
What happened to her?

1270
01:33:50,452 --> 01:33:51,252
- Dear
- What?

1271
01:33:51,492 --> 01:33:52,692
Kamali has come down

1272
01:33:53,172 --> 01:33:55,692
She isn't talking to
anyone since her arrival

1273
01:33:55,852 --> 01:33:57,252
Please go and check on her

1274
01:34:02,412 --> 01:34:02,892
Kamali

1275
01:34:06,292 --> 01:34:06,772
Kamali

1276
01:34:08,772 --> 01:34:09,252
Dear Kamali

1277
01:34:36,452 --> 01:34:38,932
She must be exhausted.
She is in deep sleep

1278
01:34:39,212 --> 01:34:41,012
Look here, she is educated

1279
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:43,132
If she has a problem,
she'll tell us

1280
01:34:43,172 --> 01:34:44,572
Don't confuse yourself

1281
01:34:44,932 --> 01:34:47,772
Her tastebuds must have died.
Cook her favourite dishes

1282
01:34:49,052 --> 01:34:49,612
Ok

1283
01:35:08,052 --> 01:35:09,452
What a disloyal world, sir

1284
01:35:09,852 --> 01:35:10,332
What?

1285
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,972
Kamali has come down from Chennai.
Did you know, sir?

1286
01:35:13,012 --> 01:35:14,572
Kamali is here. When did she come?

1287
01:35:15,732 --> 01:35:17,492
- It's been two days
- Two days?!

1288
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:20,052
- Why didn't she meet me?
- Oh, come on, sir!

1289
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:21,772
She didn't even bother to meet me...

1290
01:35:26,452 --> 01:35:27,172
I will catch her

1291
01:35:35,372 --> 01:35:36,612
Looks like Kamali has come down?

1292
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:37,212
Yes sir

1293
01:35:37,252 --> 01:35:38,172
Is she still sleeping?

1294
01:35:38,492 --> 01:35:39,332
Wait, I'll call her, sir

1295
01:35:42,892 --> 01:35:43,372
Kamali...

1296
01:35:44,652 --> 01:35:45,852
Nambi sir is here

1297
01:35:46,612 --> 01:35:47,652
"Nambi sir is here"

1298
01:35:47,972 --> 01:35:48,452
Get lost

1299
01:36:07,892 --> 01:36:09,012
I should kick her first!

1300
01:36:09,092 --> 01:36:11,892
What's up, IITian? Is
this the time to wake up?

1301
01:36:13,012 --> 01:36:14,732
Lazy girl! Come, let's go for a jog

1302
01:36:15,452 --> 01:36:16,132
Two minutes, sir

1303
01:36:54,012 --> 01:36:55,932
I see a change in you

1304
01:36:57,172 --> 01:36:57,732
I mean...

1305
01:36:58,252 --> 01:37:02,772
A quiet Kamali is very new to me

1306
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:46,652
Welcome, Kamali. How are you?

1307
01:37:48,372 --> 01:37:48,852
Coffee

1308
01:37:53,852 --> 01:37:58,012
He cleared all the photos from the wall,
hung your photo and guess what he said?

1309
01:37:58,212 --> 01:38:00,612
"There is no meaning to all the
awards that I won until now"

1310
01:38:00,772 --> 01:38:02,652
"This is the real award that I've won"

1311
01:38:02,732 --> 01:38:06,812
"Every year I must hang more
students' photo on this wall"

1312
01:38:06,852 --> 01:38:09,652
"I must decorate my wall with my
students photos" That's what he said

1313
01:38:21,092 --> 01:38:21,572
Hi

1314
01:38:23,852 --> 01:38:25,132
We are upset with you!

1315
01:38:25,452 --> 01:38:25,932
Why?

1316
01:38:26,012 --> 01:38:27,932
Why? He keeps singing your
praises all the time!

1317
01:38:27,972 --> 01:38:31,332
"Kamali won't do so! Kamali would've done
it like this! Kamali won't take much time!"

1318
01:38:31,452 --> 01:38:33,332
All he says is "Kamali!"
"Kamali!" "Kamali!"

1319
01:38:33,412 --> 01:38:35,612
You're the reason we get
scoldings from him!

1320
01:38:36,012 --> 01:38:40,052
This bun face Uppili has taken an oath.
Guess what?

1321
01:38:40,092 --> 01:38:40,572
What is it?

1322
01:38:40,612 --> 01:38:44,172
He says he'll secure at least a
rank above you in the entrance

1323
01:38:44,892 --> 01:38:45,532
Super!

1324
01:38:54,492 --> 01:38:54,972
Sit

1325
01:38:55,332 --> 01:38:56,252
Sir, I shall leave now

1326
01:38:56,692 --> 01:38:59,252
Why the hurry? I thought you'd
be here for couple of days

1327
01:39:00,252 --> 01:39:03,092
No, sir. I must leave. I have
an important class tomorrow

1328
01:39:03,332 --> 01:39:04,812
Good! That's my girl!

1329
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:05,932
See you, sir

1330
01:39:07,492 --> 01:39:11,012
Kids, today our subject
is Organic Chemistry. Ok?

1331
01:40:20,972 --> 01:40:24,492
"Long ago, I was a bird"

1332
01:40:24,572 --> 01:40:28,092
"Living in a beautiful
forest, in a small nest"

1333
01:40:32,492 --> 01:40:35,892
"Long ago, I was a bird"

1334
01:40:36,292 --> 01:40:39,692
"Living in a beautiful
forest, in a small nest"

1335
01:40:39,852 --> 01:40:44,732
"Carrying so many desires like the
clouds that has no boundaries"

1336
01:40:47,612 --> 01:40:55,972
"Feathers are my best friends
and I will fly above the sky!"

1337
01:40:59,052 --> 01:41:02,292
"So, show me the sky!"

1338
01:41:02,852 --> 01:41:06,212
"Let me have that self realization!"

1339
01:41:06,732 --> 01:41:10,172
"So, show me the sky!"

1340
01:41:10,572 --> 01:41:13,532
"Let me have that self realization!"

1341
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:33,972
"If love can make me fly even higher..."

1342
01:41:34,012 --> 01:41:37,332
"I rather prefer not to and instead
I'll still fly without it"

1343
01:41:37,812 --> 01:41:41,652
"If love can make me fly even higher..."

1344
01:41:41,732 --> 01:41:45,052
"I rather prefer not to and instead
I'll still fly without it"

1345
01:41:45,212 --> 01:41:48,452
"Failures that I never even
saw in my wildest dreams..."

1346
01:41:48,572 --> 01:41:52,532
"became a reality and
left me devastated"

1347
01:41:52,852 --> 01:41:56,612
"I have now lost the sense of direction..."

1348
01:41:56,692 --> 01:42:00,212
"So, show me the sky!"

1349
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:03,692
"Let me have that self realization!"

1350
01:42:04,332 --> 01:42:08,212
"So, show me the sky!"

1351
01:42:08,252 --> 01:42:11,412
"Let me have that self realization!"

1352
01:42:27,452 --> 01:42:31,052
"Enough is enough and it's
time to bid goodbye..."

1353
01:42:31,212 --> 01:42:35,812
"So goodbye my love, your
dreams are no more!"

1354
01:42:38,932 --> 01:42:42,652
"Enough is enough and it's
time to bid goodbye..."

1355
01:42:42,812 --> 01:42:46,452
"So goodbye my love, your
dreams are no more!"

1356
01:42:46,612 --> 01:42:49,892
"Once again in the beautiful
forest that I live in..."

1357
01:42:50,412 --> 01:42:53,652
"In my small nest that I reside in..."

1358
01:42:54,212 --> 01:43:01,292
"I now continue to live as I move on"

1359
01:43:02,012 --> 01:43:09,252
"Now, when there are many out there in
the forest who dream to be like me"

1360
01:43:09,692 --> 01:43:17,012
"Many birds from the same forest that
flew to glory, getting inspired by me"

1361
01:43:17,332 --> 01:43:20,772
"So, show me the sky!"

1362
01:43:21,092 --> 01:43:24,532
"Let me have that self realization!"

1363
01:43:24,972 --> 01:43:28,572
"So, show me the sky!"

1364
01:43:28,852 --> 01:43:32,092
"Let me have that self realization!"

1365
01:43:32,732 --> 01:43:34,892
Today we're going to revise all the gates

1366
01:43:34,932 --> 01:43:38,052
AND gate, the NOR gate, the
OR gate and the EXOR gate

1367
01:43:40,692 --> 01:43:44,252
"Long ago, I was a bird"

1368
01:43:44,572 --> 01:43:48,012
"Living in a beautiful
forest, in a small nest"

1369
01:43:52,532 --> 01:43:55,692
"Long ago, I was a bird"

1370
01:43:56,052 --> 01:43:59,412
"Here I am, ready to fly again!"

1371
01:43:59,612 --> 01:44:04,532
"New dreams are here to achieve and
I'm daring enough to face them"

1372
01:44:07,252 --> 01:44:10,932
"Now, there is no one who could stop me!"

1373
01:44:11,052 --> 01:44:14,852
"Love lost is no more a burden"

1374
01:44:15,092 --> 01:44:18,532
"My eyes have dried up"

1375
01:44:18,772 --> 01:44:22,372
"I am not afraid to overcome
my failures anymore"

1376
01:44:22,572 --> 01:44:25,452
"Now, I see the sky!"

1377
01:44:26,412 --> 01:44:29,612
"I have had my self realization!"

1378
01:44:30,292 --> 01:44:33,972
"Now, I see the sky!"

1379
01:44:34,092 --> 01:44:37,932
"I have had my self realization!"

1380
01:44:38,172 --> 01:44:41,452
"Now, I see the sky!"

1381
01:44:41,812 --> 01:44:44,932
"I have had my self realization!"

1382
01:44:45,452 --> 01:44:48,212
"Now, I see the sky!"

1383
01:44:49,452 --> 01:44:52,532
"I have had my self realization!"

1384
01:45:47,972 --> 01:45:50,012
I knew that you'd be here!

1385
01:45:50,492 --> 01:45:53,572
You don't mingle with anyone and spend
all the time alone in the library!

1386
01:45:54,012 --> 01:45:55,292
What are you studying so hard?

1387
01:45:56,092 --> 01:45:56,812
Aren't you bored?

1388
01:45:57,212 --> 01:45:59,412
Alone? Look at all
my friends around me

1389
01:45:59,652 --> 01:46:02,012
Albert Einstien, Alva
Edison, Stephen Hawking

1390
01:46:02,372 --> 01:46:03,052
Good one

1391
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:04,212
But not funny!

1392
01:46:04,252 --> 01:46:05,292
Fine, what's the matter?

1393
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:07,612
We are going to Delhi!

1394
01:46:08,332 --> 01:46:08,812
For what?

1395
01:46:09,172 --> 01:46:10,332
Come with me, I'll tell you

1396
01:46:10,452 --> 01:46:11,812
I don't have time to roam around!

1397
01:46:12,092 --> 01:46:13,292
There's a lot to study

1398
01:46:13,692 --> 01:46:14,412
I'm not coming

1399
01:46:17,652 --> 01:46:19,652
- I hadn't save it
- I saved it. Now, come!

1400
01:46:20,092 --> 01:46:20,812
Wait, my phone

1401
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:26,092
What is your problem?

1402
01:46:26,132 --> 01:46:27,452
Just come with me, I'll tell you

1403
01:46:31,092 --> 01:46:32,212
Move fast!

1404
01:46:33,092 --> 01:46:37,012
Imagine, we both having a good
time in Delhi for three days!

1405
01:46:37,212 --> 01:46:37,692
How?

1406
01:46:38,052 --> 01:46:40,172
A small test. We'll give
that and it'll take us there

1407
01:46:40,292 --> 01:46:40,772
A test?

1408
01:46:41,172 --> 01:46:43,332
Don't worry. I'm thoroughly prepared

1409
01:46:43,452 --> 01:46:45,212
You sit next to me in the exam hall

1410
01:46:45,252 --> 01:46:48,652
Choose the best answer types of question.
I'll show one finger and that means option A

1411
01:46:48,692 --> 01:46:50,012
Two fingers for B

1412
01:46:50,212 --> 01:46:52,892
- Three fingers means C and
four fingers means... - D

1413
01:46:53,932 --> 01:46:55,852
Good! You got the idea

1414
01:46:56,132 --> 01:46:58,612
Mal practice is not my style.
Just leave me alone

1415
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:02,652
Nothing is wrong if we
have to roam Delhi!

1416
01:47:05,412 --> 01:47:06,852
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me

1417
01:47:16,772 --> 01:47:17,452
- What?
- Come

1418
01:47:18,052 --> 01:47:18,532
What?

1419
01:47:18,812 --> 01:47:19,772
We'll go to the back

1420
01:47:32,052 --> 01:47:32,612
Quiz?!

1421
01:47:33,372 --> 01:47:34,492
Why would you do this to me?

1422
01:47:34,892 --> 01:47:35,812
Other subjects are fine

1423
01:47:36,092 --> 01:47:38,212
But talking in English
is what makes me nervous

1424
01:47:39,012 --> 01:47:41,892
If I go and screw things up in such a
big stage then it'll be embarrassing

1425
01:47:42,652 --> 01:47:43,692
Don't think too much

1426
01:47:44,292 --> 01:47:45,412
Ain't I here to help?

1427
01:47:45,772 --> 01:47:46,572
Just follow me

1428
01:47:46,892 --> 01:47:48,652
Good morning. Good
morning, everyone

1429
01:47:50,212 --> 01:47:51,252
All of you know, right...

1430
01:47:51,732 --> 01:47:55,812
Among all of you, the best two is going
to be selected to represent IIT, Madras

1431
01:47:55,892 --> 01:48:00,372
in the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam memorial
quiz competition to be held in New Delhi!

1432
01:48:00,652 --> 01:48:01,132
Right?

1433
01:48:01,852 --> 01:48:02,412
All the best!

1434
01:48:03,012 --> 01:48:03,492
Do well

1435
01:48:04,132 --> 01:48:04,972
Please pass it on

1436
01:48:15,532 --> 01:48:16,012
Wait

1437
01:48:27,492 --> 01:48:27,972
Ok

1438
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:47,452
Follow me

1439
01:49:08,572 --> 01:49:09,692
Ok, time's up!

1440
01:49:26,052 --> 01:49:26,532
Thank you

1441
01:49:44,612 --> 01:49:46,332
You didn't follow my instructions at all

1442
01:49:46,452 --> 01:49:47,972
I guess, you must've screwed it up

1443
01:49:49,572 --> 01:49:51,092
You missed an
excellent opportunity

1444
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:53,092
Now, someone else is
going to come with me

1445
01:49:53,252 --> 01:49:53,972
All the best!

1446
01:49:56,372 --> 01:49:59,252
You know, I heard that the teams are
gonna be really strong this year, for the day

1447
01:49:59,332 --> 01:50:01,212
- Oh! Really?
- I'm so excited

1448
01:50:08,972 --> 01:50:09,732
Who is this Kamali?

1449
01:50:10,652 --> 01:50:12,132
That Cinderella girl

1450
01:50:17,292 --> 01:50:20,452
But...I...I think there is some confusion.
How is this possible?

1451
01:50:21,212 --> 01:50:22,852
May be one of her lucky days

1452
01:50:24,252 --> 01:50:25,332
I'm so worried

1453
01:50:25,412 --> 01:50:27,132
I think I'm gonna
speak to the HODs now

1454
01:50:34,852 --> 01:50:37,412
Looks like you are ready to go to Delhi?
With fresh, washed dress?

1455
01:50:37,612 --> 01:50:38,332
What do you mean?

1456
01:50:38,892 --> 01:50:39,932
Haven't you seen it yet?

1457
01:50:40,332 --> 01:50:41,132
Seen what?

1458
01:50:41,492 --> 01:50:42,732
The quiz results are out

1459
01:50:42,932 --> 01:50:44,412
Wow! Congrats!

1460
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:46,972
I didn't get selected

1461
01:50:47,212 --> 01:50:48,492
You got selected though

1462
01:50:48,652 --> 01:50:50,212
Stop kidding

1463
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:53,012
Look here

1464
01:50:58,052 --> 01:50:58,692
I'm not going

1465
01:50:59,932 --> 01:51:00,892
What do you mean?

1466
01:51:01,292 --> 01:51:01,972
Look here...

1467
01:51:02,332 --> 01:51:04,252
I wrote that quiz exam
because you forced me to

1468
01:51:04,332 --> 01:51:06,012
- Oh God!
- I'm not interested in all this

1469
01:51:06,852 --> 01:51:10,132
In all these days here, do you
have any other friends except me?

1470
01:51:10,412 --> 01:51:13,852
Are you happy with doing back and forth
between classes, hostel and library?

1471
01:51:14,452 --> 01:51:16,892
Going new places, connecting
with new people...

1472
01:51:17,172 --> 01:51:19,372
It's a great opportunity
to explore life more

1473
01:51:20,852 --> 01:51:21,332
No thanks

1474
01:51:22,212 --> 01:51:23,412
I... am not interested in going

1475
01:51:23,732 --> 01:51:25,652
Trust me! You should go!

1476
01:52:05,715 --> 01:52:06,275
Tell me

1477
01:52:06,355 --> 01:52:07,875
Are you on your train journey?

1478
01:52:08,195 --> 01:52:09,835
No, I'm on my way in a chariot

1479
01:52:10,875 --> 01:52:14,555
So, I hear you started smoking?

1480
01:52:15,115 --> 01:52:15,915
Who told you?

1481
01:52:18,515 --> 01:52:19,195
Valli?

1482
01:52:20,195 --> 01:52:20,955
Nothing of that sort

1483
01:52:21,315 --> 01:52:23,715
You better quit it or
else I'll tell dad

1484
01:52:24,115 --> 01:52:24,875
Go ahead! Tell him!

1485
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:26,115
I'll also tell on you

1486
01:52:26,675 --> 01:52:27,675
What are you blabbing?

1487
01:52:28,395 --> 01:52:30,955
Valli leaked you secret to me.
I know why you joined IIT

1488
01:52:31,875 --> 01:52:34,555
Dear brother, Vishwa...
I was just kidding

1489
01:52:34,755 --> 01:52:36,435
Come on, don't get serious about it

1490
01:52:36,675 --> 01:52:39,555
I don't want my brother's health to
be affected. Hence, I advised you

1491
01:52:39,595 --> 01:52:41,675
So tell me, what should I
get my brother, from Delhi?

1492
01:52:41,715 --> 01:52:42,955
Good! Attagirl!

1493
01:52:43,315 --> 01:52:44,515
I don't want anything

1494
01:52:44,955 --> 01:52:46,955
This oldie is pestering me

1495
01:52:47,035 --> 01:52:48,315
- Talk to her
- Sure

1496
01:52:48,715 --> 01:52:49,755
- Kamali
- Grandma

1497
01:52:50,075 --> 01:52:53,675
I hear we get good quality shawls and
sweaters in Delhi for less price

1498
01:52:53,915 --> 01:52:55,035
Can you get me a few?

1499
01:52:55,075 --> 01:52:55,835
Sure

1500
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:56,875
Ok...

1501
01:52:57,395 --> 01:52:59,075
Why do you sound dull, oldie?

1502
01:52:59,435 --> 01:53:01,315
Isn't your daughter-in-law
taking care of you?

1503
01:53:01,635 --> 01:53:06,355
She restricts a lot on my diet in the
name of diabetes and cholesterol

1504
01:53:06,395 --> 01:53:06,995
Give it to me

1505
01:53:08,315 --> 01:53:10,835
You're traveling very far.
Take care, dear

1506
01:53:10,915 --> 01:53:11,795
Ok, mom

1507
01:53:13,475 --> 01:53:14,875
Are you traveling alone?

1508
01:53:15,355 --> 01:53:17,435
No, our professor is
coming along with us

1509
01:53:18,515 --> 01:53:21,915
Myself and my senior, Ashwin are
participating in the competition

1510
01:53:23,315 --> 01:53:23,955
Ashwin?

1511
01:53:24,635 --> 01:53:25,115
Yes

1512
01:53:25,755 --> 01:53:26,875
Really? Ashwin?

1513
01:53:27,435 --> 01:53:28,075
I said, yes!

1514
01:53:28,475 --> 01:53:29,555
Did you confess your love?

1515
01:53:30,355 --> 01:53:30,835
No

1516
01:53:31,715 --> 01:53:35,395
Why? This is your best chance.
Don't miss it!

1517
01:53:36,195 --> 01:53:37,595
Stop yapping away!

1518
01:53:38,195 --> 01:53:39,635
Hang up! I'll call you later

1519
01:53:56,435 --> 01:53:57,315
Coffee! Coffee!

1520
01:53:58,715 --> 01:53:59,195
Coffee!

1521
01:53:59,835 --> 01:54:00,315
Ashwin...

1522
01:54:01,155 --> 01:54:01,755
Coffee?

1523
01:54:02,195 --> 01:54:02,675
No

1524
01:54:04,115 --> 01:54:04,595
Coffee!

1525
01:54:05,195 --> 01:54:05,675
Sir...

1526
01:54:06,515 --> 01:54:07,275
Coffee for you?

1527
01:54:08,475 --> 01:54:08,955
No

1528
01:54:10,315 --> 01:54:12,275
- Coffee! Coffee!
- One coffee please

1529
01:54:46,675 --> 01:54:47,835
Clean up. Clean up

1530
01:54:56,595 --> 01:54:57,155
Aiyo!

1531
01:55:04,595 --> 01:55:06,315
Why are you screwing
this up so bad?

1532
01:55:21,195 --> 01:55:22,395
I think you're nervous

1533
01:55:25,595 --> 01:55:26,355
Is it so obvious?

1534
01:55:27,835 --> 01:55:29,355
I'm trying hard to hide it

1535
01:55:30,195 --> 01:55:30,995
But I'm unable to

1536
01:55:39,275 --> 01:55:39,755
So...

1537
01:55:40,555 --> 01:55:42,315
Are you still in love with that boy?

1538
01:55:45,795 --> 01:55:46,355
I don't know

1539
01:55:50,435 --> 01:55:50,915
But...

1540
01:55:51,515 --> 01:55:53,155
Definitely he is my inspiration

1541
01:55:56,235 --> 01:55:56,715
Right

1542
01:55:59,875 --> 01:56:01,355
You're quite something

1543
01:56:09,555 --> 01:56:12,155
Did you bring any books?

1544
01:56:12,395 --> 01:56:13,195
I have

1545
01:56:15,035 --> 01:56:15,515
Here

1546
01:56:19,555 --> 01:56:20,275
No, thanks

1547
01:56:27,795 --> 01:56:28,275
Ashwin...

1548
01:56:29,235 --> 01:56:30,235
I know very well...

1549
01:56:31,235 --> 01:56:33,635
You have taken part and
won in many competition

1550
01:56:34,115 --> 01:56:36,075
But this is my first competition

1551
01:56:36,715 --> 01:56:37,955
Which is why I'm so nervous

1552
01:56:38,875 --> 01:56:41,235
Hope you'll manage if
I make some blunder

1553
01:56:45,315 --> 01:56:45,955
It's ok

1554
01:56:47,755 --> 01:56:48,235
Just...

1555
01:56:48,715 --> 01:56:49,475
do one thing

1556
01:56:49,995 --> 01:56:50,675
Read this book

1557
01:56:51,635 --> 01:56:51,955
Ok

1558
01:56:52,035 --> 01:56:55,155
I've underlined some important stuff.
Just go through it. It'll help

1559
01:57:34,555 --> 01:57:35,875
- Ashwin...
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back

1560
01:57:35,915 --> 01:57:36,395
Sir?

1561
01:57:36,435 --> 01:57:36,955
Got the keys

1562
01:57:37,315 --> 01:57:38,235
- Let's go
- Fine, sir

1563
01:57:38,555 --> 01:57:39,395
Who was on the call?

1564
01:57:39,875 --> 01:57:40,915
- Preethi, right?
- Yes, sir

1565
01:57:41,275 --> 01:57:42,955
What do you guys talk for so long?

1566
01:57:43,275 --> 01:57:45,595
Sir, I can talk to her about
anything under the sky

1567
01:57:45,915 --> 01:57:47,435
You must be missing her today, right?

1568
01:57:47,475 --> 01:57:48,595
Yes, sir. Of course

1569
01:57:49,155 --> 01:57:49,635
Let's go

1570
01:58:37,555 --> 01:58:38,275
Hey, Ashwin

1571
01:58:38,515 --> 01:58:39,195
Hey man!

1572
01:58:41,715 --> 01:58:44,755
Dude, don't you fall sick at all?

1573
01:58:45,035 --> 01:58:47,235
You turn up every
year and win the cup!

1574
01:58:47,555 --> 01:58:49,275
I'm tired of losing to you, man!

1575
01:58:49,915 --> 01:58:50,595
See you, dude

1576
01:58:59,115 --> 01:58:59,595
Hello

1577
01:59:00,835 --> 01:59:01,315
Tell me

1578
01:59:02,875 --> 01:59:03,795
Well, I am...

1579
01:59:03,995 --> 01:59:04,715
at the temple

1580
01:59:05,835 --> 01:59:06,515
Just a minute

1581
01:59:07,155 --> 01:59:07,915
Dear priest...

1582
01:59:08,355 --> 01:59:09,955
offer prayers in
the name of Vasantha

1583
01:59:10,555 --> 01:59:13,075
Lineage: Bharadwaj and
birth star: Krithika

1584
01:59:14,395 --> 01:59:15,675
Ok, shall I call you back later?

1585
01:59:16,035 --> 01:59:16,515
Ok

1586
01:59:30,995 --> 01:59:31,715
Shall I help you?

1587
01:59:31,755 --> 01:59:32,875
No, thanks

1588
01:59:47,075 --> 01:59:47,835
Hey, Ashwin...

1589
01:59:48,435 --> 01:59:49,155
Where's Preethi?

1590
01:59:50,795 --> 01:59:52,515
It's one of her unlucky days

1591
01:59:52,755 --> 01:59:53,555
She couldn't make it

1592
01:59:54,955 --> 01:59:56,555
She must be very happy

1593
01:59:56,795 --> 01:59:59,235
She's got a relief
from you, after all!

1594
02:00:01,555 --> 02:00:02,875
Just kidding, man!

1595
02:00:09,715 --> 02:00:10,195
Coffee?

1596
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:12,435
Please

1597
02:00:13,275 --> 02:00:13,755
Thanks

1598
02:00:13,995 --> 02:00:14,635
Welcome

1599
02:00:28,635 --> 02:00:29,115
Kamali...

1600
02:00:31,235 --> 02:00:32,315
He is drooling over you

1601
02:00:33,035 --> 02:00:34,035
Don't encourage him

1602
02:00:39,715 --> 02:00:40,795
Good morning, folks

1603
02:00:40,835 --> 02:00:46,435
Warm welcome everybody to the Abdul Kalam
Memorial All India IIT Quiz Championship

1604
02:00:46,515 --> 02:00:50,355
We're about to begin the elimination
rounds to decide the four finalists

1605
02:00:50,515 --> 02:00:53,395
The top one in each pool
will reach the finals

1606
02:00:53,435 --> 02:00:57,355
May I request ll the participating
teams to get into the allotted halls

1607
02:00:57,515 --> 02:00:59,595
We would start in the
next five minutes

1608
02:00:59,795 --> 02:01:00,795
Yes sir, we'll do it!

1609
02:01:00,835 --> 02:01:02,035
- All the best, do well
- Alright, sure

1610
02:01:02,075 --> 02:01:02,595
Do well!

1611
02:01:02,635 --> 02:01:03,115
Thank you

1612
02:01:04,675 --> 02:01:06,675
- Do well. All the best, guys
- Sure, we'll make it

1613
02:01:22,675 --> 02:01:25,355
When you don't know the correct
answer, why did you press the buzzer?

1614
02:01:25,795 --> 02:01:27,715
Actually Ashwin, I
misunderstood the question

1615
02:01:29,115 --> 02:01:31,635
This is why I spoke to
the HOD the other day

1616
02:01:31,955 --> 02:01:35,035
I told him you aren't suited for this and
I'd like to take Preethi along with me

1617
02:01:36,435 --> 02:01:37,635
But he didn't understand

1618
02:01:37,795 --> 02:01:40,635
Now, I'm gonna lose this competition
because of you dumb, country girl

1619
02:01:57,115 --> 02:01:58,355
What happened, guys?

1620
02:01:59,635 --> 02:02:00,715
Here we go!

1621
02:02:01,155 --> 02:02:03,595
That was a well fought contest

1622
02:02:03,755 --> 02:02:06,395
And we have the best four teams

1623
02:02:06,515 --> 02:02:10,035
The qualified teams for
the final battle are...

1624
02:02:12,915 --> 02:02:13,395
Yes!

1625
02:02:17,395 --> 02:02:19,315
- Yes!
- Yes! Superb!

1626
02:02:21,635 --> 02:02:23,675
- Oh yes!
- I'm very proud of you guys!

1627
02:02:23,995 --> 02:02:24,715
And...

1628
02:02:26,915 --> 02:02:28,155
Yes! We did it!

1629
02:02:31,155 --> 02:02:32,955
I was worried

1630
02:02:34,875 --> 02:02:36,715
Guys, we qualified

1631
02:02:37,035 --> 02:02:39,435
Wha... wha.. what's the problem?

1632
02:02:39,835 --> 02:02:41,555
Sir, actually we lost because of her

1633
02:02:42,795 --> 02:02:45,475
Thankfully the Bombay guys made a
mistake and got negative points

1634
02:02:45,555 --> 02:02:47,075
That's why we are
in the competition

1635
02:02:47,155 --> 02:02:48,475
Otherwise we would've lost

1636
02:03:13,835 --> 02:03:14,595
Hi Kamali

1637
02:03:16,635 --> 02:03:20,555
I know this guy Ashwin is always obsessed
with winning and nothing else matters

1638
02:03:21,955 --> 02:03:23,035
Don't take it seriously

1639
02:03:23,595 --> 02:03:25,195
It is fine to make few mistakes

1640
02:03:25,675 --> 02:03:26,955
It's not the end of the world

1641
02:03:27,915 --> 02:03:30,595
I bet a smart girl like you
shouldn't worry about what he said

1642
02:03:30,835 --> 02:03:31,995
Hello! Stop it

1643
02:03:32,195 --> 02:03:34,155
You don't have to intervene
and mess things up

1644
02:03:34,315 --> 02:03:36,115
There is no problem
between him and myself

1645
02:03:36,195 --> 02:03:37,235
What are you saying?

1646
02:03:38,595 --> 02:03:39,595
I know him very well

1647
02:03:40,355 --> 02:03:41,395
There is no problem here

1648
02:03:42,275 --> 02:03:43,515
And thanks for your advice

1649
02:03:44,075 --> 02:03:44,715
I'm not upset

1650
02:04:18,825 --> 02:04:22,105
Hello and a warm welcome to
each and everyone of you

1651
02:04:22,305 --> 02:04:25,865
You're with me, Pickbrain, here

02:04:26,185 --> 02:04:31,345
of the APJ Abdul Kalam Memorial

1653
02:04:32,505 --> 02:04:36,065
As this nation observes the
memorial day of the great legend...

1654
02:04:36,345 --> 02:04:38,465
and the former
president of our country

1655
02:04:38,585 --> 02:04:42,425
One of the most inspirational
leaders of our times

1656
02:04:42,985 --> 02:04:47,985
We're delighted to bring this quiz
live to all of you across this nation...

1658
02:04:52,425 --> 02:04:53,585
Ladies and gentlemen...

1659
02:04:53,665 --> 02:04:57,345
It's time for us to get started
here today with this final

1660
02:04:57,705 --> 02:05:00,505
All of these teams have made
it to the national final...

1661
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:02,785
after grueling rounds of quizzing

1662
02:05:03,465 --> 02:05:05,465
And now! We are all set...

1663
02:05:05,785 --> 02:05:12,705
for the National Final of the Dr. APJ
Abdul Kalam Memorial Inter IIT Quiz

1664
02:05:13,305 --> 02:05:14,625
Let me tell you something

1665
02:05:14,905 --> 02:05:16,025
It does not...

1666
02:05:16,425 --> 02:05:16,905
Get...

1667
02:05:17,265 --> 02:05:18,385
Bigger than this!

1668
02:05:18,825 --> 02:05:23,145
Let's see who the teams are and
have them introduce themselves

1669
02:05:23,745 --> 02:05:25,745
Girish Tiwari from IIT, Roorkee

1670
02:05:26,025 --> 02:05:27,825
Sujit Sharma from IIT, Roorkee

1671
02:05:28,025 --> 02:05:29,705
This Varun Singh from IIT Kanpur

1672
02:05:29,785 --> 02:05:32,265
And this is Dharwan Singh
Negi from IIT Kanpur

1673
02:05:32,345 --> 02:05:34,225
Shanuna Saxena from IIT, Delhi

1674
02:05:34,305 --> 02:05:35,905
Anshul Roy from IIT, Delhi

1675
02:05:36,025 --> 02:05:37,985
I'm Ashwin Anand from IIT, Madras

1676
02:05:38,105 --> 02:05:39,825
Kamali Shanmugam from IIT, Madras

1677
02:05:39,905 --> 02:05:42,625
Why is she wearing a
dull colored dress?

1678
02:05:42,985 --> 02:05:45,265
Couldn't she have turned up
in a bright colored dress?

1679
02:05:45,505 --> 02:05:48,385
Let me first explain the
format and rules of the game...

1680
02:05:48,545 --> 02:05:50,265
before we start playing

1681
02:05:51,145 --> 02:05:53,665
We will have three rounds
of quizzing, here today

1682
02:05:54,305 --> 02:05:55,665
The three rounds are named...

1683
02:05:55,705 --> 02:05:57,265
- Ignited minds
- Kamali looks good in this dress

1684
02:05:57,385 --> 02:05:59,985
Turning points and Wings of Fire

1685
02:06:00,385 --> 02:06:03,985
All questions in the quiz
will be played on the buzzer

1686
02:06:04,465 --> 02:06:07,625
If you get right, you
get a +20 points...

1687
02:06:07,985 --> 02:06:09,185
on the first attempt

1688
02:06:09,505 --> 02:06:11,985
If someone gets wrong
on the first attempt...

1689
02:06:12,305 --> 02:06:16,545
the remaining three teams are allowed
to play a second attempt on the buzzer

1690
02:06:16,905 --> 02:06:20,305
But the value of the answer
comes down to 10 points

1691
02:06:20,505 --> 02:06:23,425
So, first attempt, 20. Second attempt, 10

1692
02:06:23,585 --> 02:06:27,025
The negative is a constant -10

1693
02:06:27,185 --> 02:06:28,425
What is he saying?

1694
02:06:28,585 --> 02:06:31,105
Three rounds in total. Correct
answer earns 20 points

1695
02:06:31,185 --> 02:06:33,025
Wrong answer and the
team will lose 10 points

1696
02:06:33,105 --> 02:06:35,225
Lets begin with the first question

1697
02:06:35,385 --> 02:06:37,105
What was the code name...

1698
02:06:37,465 --> 02:06:38,425
I repeat

1699
02:06:38,745 --> 02:06:40,785
What was the code name...

1700
02:06:41,065 --> 02:06:42,985
of the first nuclear test...

1701
02:06:43,105 --> 02:06:45,745
conducted by the
United States of America...

1702
02:06:46,185 --> 02:06:50,225
on the 16th of July 1945

1703
02:06:52,505 --> 02:06:54,785
IIT, Madras have gone for it

1704
02:06:55,425 --> 02:06:55,905
Trinity

1705
02:06:56,425 --> 02:06:57,825
Absolutely right!

1706
02:07:01,785 --> 02:07:03,585
They have got the first answer!

1707
02:07:04,105 --> 02:07:06,905
Conducted as parts of the
Manhattan project...

1708
02:07:07,225 --> 02:07:11,225
This nuclear detonation test
was code named "Trinity"

1709
02:07:11,305 --> 02:07:14,905
And in fact, it was inspired
by the poetry of John Dunn

1710
02:07:15,665 --> 02:07:17,345
Well done IIT, Madras

1711
02:07:17,625 --> 02:07:19,105
20 points to you

1712
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:21,385
Moving on to the next question

1713
02:07:21,985 --> 02:07:25,785
What in India is produced under...

1714
02:07:26,065 --> 02:07:30,425
the manufacturing specification IS1

1715
02:07:30,825 --> 02:07:32,785
As in the number one

1716
02:07:39,905 --> 02:07:40,745
IS1?

1717
02:07:40,945 --> 02:07:41,745
I know the answer

1718
02:07:44,865 --> 02:07:46,545
Kanpur have gone for it

1719
02:07:46,825 --> 02:07:47,825
It's Indian national flag

1720
02:07:48,185 --> 02:07:50,505
Absolutely brilliant!

1721
02:07:51,105 --> 02:07:51,585
Yes!

1722
02:07:55,145 --> 02:08:00,145
India's first product, is
technically, our national flag

1723
02:08:00,545 --> 02:08:03,385
Well done IIT, Kanpur.
20 points to you

1724
02:08:03,545 --> 02:08:05,425
What a way to get started

1725
02:08:11,425 --> 02:08:13,305
Wonder what's the
point table standings

1726
02:08:13,705 --> 02:08:16,945
- What a bad time for power outage, at my home!
- That's the end of first round of the quiz

1727
02:08:17,025 --> 02:08:18,905
- Please come, sir. Have a seat
- Get up! Sit there

1728
02:08:18,945 --> 02:08:20,705
Let's take a look at where the teams stand

1729
02:08:21,505 --> 02:08:24,825
IIT, Kanpur are leading this quiz with 70

1730
02:08:26,385 --> 02:08:29,905
Right behind them are IIT, Madras with 60

1731
02:08:30,745 --> 02:08:34,225
- Following them are IIT, Delhi with 40
- Our team is still in second place?

1732
02:08:34,265 --> 02:08:37,385
- And on 20 are IIT, Roorkee
- Shoe? I left them at the entrance

1733
02:08:37,425 --> 02:08:41,105
Time for us to move to the
next round of this quiz final

1734
02:08:41,385 --> 02:08:44,265
Time for us to play "Turning points"

1735
02:08:45,985 --> 02:08:47,385
Here's the next question

1736
02:08:47,745 --> 02:08:49,065
Hands on the buzzer

1737
02:08:49,185 --> 02:08:50,185
Concentrate

1738
02:08:51,025 --> 02:08:55,505
Which British artist painted
the famous painting...

1739
02:08:56,105 --> 02:09:00,145
of the industrial
landscape called "The Pond"

1740
02:09:01,985 --> 02:09:02,465
Ashwin?

1741
02:09:07,785 --> 02:09:08,985
Yes Kanpur?

1742
02:09:09,665 --> 02:09:10,385
L. S. Lowry

1743
02:09:11,065 --> 02:09:14,505
L. S. Lowry is
absolutely right!

1744
02:09:14,785 --> 02:09:16,585
Kanpur are on a roll

1745
02:09:16,945 --> 02:09:18,705
Laurence Stephen Lowry...

1746
02:09:19,025 --> 02:09:21,225
will give them 20 points

1747
02:09:24,665 --> 02:09:28,505
Who became the chancellor
of Germany for one day

1748
02:09:28,625 --> 02:09:30,505
Just one day!

1749
02:09:30,905 --> 02:09:34,745
After the death of Adolf Hitler,
during the second word war

1750
02:09:35,425 --> 02:09:36,305
Yes Chennai!

1751
02:09:36,585 --> 02:09:37,545
Joseph Goebbels

1752
02:09:37,625 --> 02:09:39,465
- Brilliant answer!
- Yes!

1753
02:09:42,985 --> 02:09:45,705
- Yay!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1754
02:09:46,785 --> 02:09:48,265
Did I hit her a bit too hard?

1755
02:09:50,425 --> 02:09:52,305
What a contest we
have witnessed!

1756
02:09:52,665 --> 02:09:54,585
Sensational quizzing...

1757
02:09:54,905 --> 02:09:57,265
and we still do not have a result

1758
02:09:57,545 --> 02:10:03,145
IIT, Madras and IIT, Kanpur have
given it everything that they have

1759
02:10:03,465 --> 02:10:07,505
And now, we have a tie
between these two teams

1760
02:10:09,105 --> 02:10:12,785
This is surely going to
be very, very interesting

1761
02:10:13,825 --> 02:10:18,585
We're going have a tie breaker round
to select our champion for this year

1762
02:10:19,305 --> 02:10:23,545
It's a face off between
IIT, Kanpur and IIT, Madras

1763
02:10:23,945 --> 02:10:27,385
But first, allow me
to explain the rules

1764
02:10:28,025 --> 02:10:29,945
There would be five questions

1765
02:10:30,225 --> 02:10:33,705
But this is going to
be an individual round

1766
02:10:34,265 --> 02:10:37,745
Each team can choose one
member from the opponent team...

1767
02:10:38,145 --> 02:10:40,465
who will face my question

1768
02:10:41,105 --> 02:10:43,985
Each question carries
a value of 20 points

1769
02:10:44,105 --> 02:10:47,665
If you get it right on the
second attempt, 10 points

1770
02:10:47,865 --> 02:10:52,225
On either of the attempts the
negative would be a minus 10

1771
02:10:52,745 --> 02:10:56,225
Can I now ask, IIT, Madras to choose...

1772
02:10:56,665 --> 02:11:00,505
Who they would like to
pick from IIT, Kanpur?

1773
02:11:03,105 --> 02:11:04,185
I guess, he'll choose you

1774
02:11:05,705 --> 02:11:06,185
Sir...

1775
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:07,105
Varun Singh

1776
02:11:08,265 --> 02:11:08,745
I like it

1777
02:11:09,025 --> 02:11:09,505
Alright

1778
02:11:10,305 --> 02:11:15,145
Can I now request IIT, Kanpur to pick up
a person from the IIT, Madras team...

1779
02:11:15,505 --> 02:11:17,425
who'll play in the tie breaker

1780
02:11:17,465 --> 02:11:18,065
Go for Ashwin

1781
02:11:18,225 --> 02:11:19,425
I don't want to take a chance

1782
02:11:23,065 --> 02:11:24,105
Kamali Shanmugam

1783
02:11:26,585 --> 02:11:30,025
Alright, both the teams
have made their decisions

1784
02:11:32,145 --> 02:11:33,985
Wrong answer will earn us minus points

1785
02:11:34,945 --> 02:11:38,025
Press the buzzer only if you
are sure about the answer

1786
02:11:51,385 --> 02:11:53,545
Varun Singh from IIT, Kanpur

1787
02:11:53,865 --> 02:11:56,065
Kamali Shanmugam
from IIT, Madras...

1788
02:11:56,385 --> 02:11:59,465
to move forward for the face off!

1789
02:12:09,985 --> 02:12:12,665
We now have the two
contestants who will face off...

1790
02:12:12,865 --> 02:12:15,185
and play for their
respective institutes

1791
02:12:15,705 --> 02:12:22,265
As the nation watches them, the fate
of this quiz depends on these two

1792
02:12:22,425 --> 02:12:24,465
May the best among them emerge...

1793
02:12:24,825 --> 02:12:25,705
the Champion!

1794
02:12:26,425 --> 02:12:28,625
So, hands on the buzzer

1795
02:12:29,065 --> 02:12:29,785
Here we go

1796
02:12:30,465 --> 02:12:33,465
What term from the world of boxing...

1797
02:12:34,025 --> 02:12:36,345
describes the orthodox style...

1798
02:12:36,665 --> 02:12:39,225
leading with the right
hand of the right foot...

1799
02:12:39,745 --> 02:12:41,505
rather than the left

1800
02:12:57,345 --> 02:12:59,665
IIT, Kanpur on the buzzer

1801
02:13:00,585 --> 02:13:01,065
Southpaw

1802
02:13:01,825 --> 02:13:03,825
Southpaw is absolutely right!

1803
02:13:04,025 --> 02:13:04,745
- Perfect!
- Yes!

1804
02:13:04,945 --> 02:13:07,905
Good start for Kanpur.
20 points to you

1805
02:13:09,985 --> 02:13:11,545
Ashwin, she'll do it. Relax! Ok

1806
02:13:11,585 --> 02:13:13,505
Moving on to the next question

1807
02:13:14,585 --> 02:13:16,905
Who is the first Indian...

1808
02:13:17,585 --> 02:13:19,065
to win an academy award...

1809
02:13:19,545 --> 02:13:24,745
popularly known as the
Oscars, in the year 1983

1810
02:13:26,465 --> 02:13:27,905
Bhanu Athaiya?

1811
02:13:30,625 --> 02:13:33,825
IIT, Kanpur are on the
buzzer, yet again

1812
02:13:33,905 --> 02:13:35,745
Can I have your answer please?

1813
02:13:35,945 --> 02:13:36,665
Bhanu Athaiya

1814
02:13:36,905 --> 02:13:38,625
Bhanu Athaiya, it is!

1815
02:13:39,265 --> 02:13:42,785
IIT, Kanpur are playing
extremely well...

1816
02:13:43,465 --> 02:13:45,825
and surging ahead in this quiz final

1817
02:13:46,265 --> 02:13:50,825
They are making it very, very
difficult for IIT, Madras

1818
02:13:51,225 --> 02:13:53,905
Trust, both of you are ready
for the next question

1819
02:13:55,145 --> 02:13:57,265
Who was the first Indian...

1820
02:13:57,785 --> 02:13:58,665
I repeat

1821
02:13:59,185 --> 02:14:01,425
Who was the first Indian...

1822
02:14:02,105 --> 02:14:03,705
in independent India...

1823
02:14:04,025 --> 02:14:07,865
to have won an individual
medal at the Olympics

1824
02:14:08,345 --> 02:14:09,625
Milkha Singh?

1825
02:14:12,745 --> 02:14:15,505
IIT, Kanpur are at it again

1826
02:14:15,745 --> 02:14:17,425
If you get it right...

1827
02:14:17,905 --> 02:14:19,665
You are the champion

1828
02:14:20,425 --> 02:14:20,905
Milkha Singh

1829
02:14:23,465 --> 02:14:26,105
Milkha Singh is the wrong answer!

1830
02:14:26,505 --> 02:14:28,665
You get a -10

1831
02:14:29,225 --> 02:14:30,385
Oh my God!

1832
02:14:31,025 --> 02:14:31,505
Well!

1833
02:14:32,225 --> 02:14:35,385
IIT, Madras are you
making an attempt?

1834
02:14:43,185 --> 02:14:44,585
K. D. Jadhav

1835
02:14:45,385 --> 02:14:48,945
I'm afraid I am not able to hear you.
Can you speak up, please?

1836
02:14:49,985 --> 02:14:50,865
K. D. Jadhav

1837
02:14:52,545 --> 02:14:54,105
K. D. Jadhav...

1838
02:14:55,065 --> 02:14:55,705
is...

1839
02:14:55,945 --> 02:14:57,305
the right answer!

1840
02:15:04,145 --> 02:15:05,025
I told you

1841
02:15:05,865 --> 02:15:12,545
I tell you what, IIT, Madras are not
going to make it easy for IIT, Kanpur

1842
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:17,865
It's time for the penultimate
question of this national final

1843
02:15:18,585 --> 02:15:24,985
"One child, one teacher, one book,
one pen can change the world"

1844
02:15:25,745 --> 02:15:30,025
This is a quote by a
famous Noble Laureate

1845
02:15:30,705 --> 02:15:32,225
Who are we talking about?

1846
02:15:34,425 --> 02:15:35,985
Come on, Kamali! You
know the answer

1847
02:15:44,465 --> 02:15:46,385
Both the teams are
in deep thought

1848
02:16:01,545 --> 02:16:02,345
Come on, Kamali!

1849
02:16:02,985 --> 02:16:03,625
Come on!

1850
02:16:07,785 --> 02:16:08,825
Come on!

1851
02:16:13,545 --> 02:16:16,145
IIT, Madras have gone for it. Go ahead

1852
02:16:17,345 --> 02:16:18,505
Malala Yousafzai

1853
02:16:18,945 --> 02:16:19,745
Yes!

1854
02:16:20,785 --> 02:16:22,705
Absolutely right!

1855
02:16:23,105 --> 02:16:26,745
- It is Malala Yousafzai!
- I told you! I told you!

1856
02:16:26,785 --> 02:16:29,785
IIT, Madras have made a remarkable
come back in this final!

1857
02:16:30,105 --> 02:16:32,425
It was a chance that you
could not have missed

1858
02:16:32,785 --> 02:16:35,225
She's got the 20 that she needed

1859
02:16:35,625 --> 02:16:40,225
What do I say? We now have
a tie within this tie

1860
02:16:40,465 --> 02:16:42,025
One question to go

1861
02:16:42,385 --> 02:16:44,865
We still don't know
who is going to win

1862
02:16:45,185 --> 02:16:48,865
And it is the final question
of the Quiz Championship

1863
02:16:49,265 --> 02:16:52,225
Who ever gets it right,
will win the title

1864
02:16:52,545 --> 02:16:55,225
The pressure is unbelievable

1865
02:16:55,545 --> 02:16:59,145
As has been the performance
of both the contestants

1866
02:16:59,345 --> 02:17:02,865
But now it's the
moment of reckoning

1867
02:17:03,305 --> 02:17:03,985
The question!

1868
02:17:04,745 --> 02:17:07,465
The great Walt Disney...

1869
02:17:08,025 --> 02:17:14,185
under the company name Laugh-O-Gram
produced seven fairy tales

1870
02:17:14,865 --> 02:17:19,905
Which one was the seventh and
the last that he produced

1871
02:17:24,505 --> 02:17:27,025
IIT, Madras have gone for it

1872
02:17:27,545 --> 02:17:28,265
Cinderella

1873
02:17:29,185 --> 02:17:30,385
Cinderella?

1874
02:17:33,025 --> 02:17:35,625
IIT, Madras have made it!

1875
02:17:36,145 --> 02:17:37,065
Yes!

1876
02:17:37,145 --> 02:17:38,545
That's my girl!

1877
02:17:39,825 --> 02:17:41,145
I couldn't have done this

1878
02:17:41,185 --> 02:17:41,985
Yes!

1879
02:17:41,985 --> 02:17:45,065
- Yay! We won!
- We did it!

1880
02:17:45,825 --> 02:17:49,105
Kamali has made IIT, Madras the Champion...

1881
02:17:49,665 --> 02:17:53,705
at the APJ Abdul
Kalam Inter IIT Quiz

1882
02:17:54,225 --> 02:17:56,945
Congratulations Kamali Shanmugam

1883
02:17:57,465 --> 02:18:02,145
You have made your family
and IIT, Madras proud!

1884
02:18:23,985 --> 02:18:25,905
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1885
02:18:28,425 --> 02:18:30,785
Congratulations Ashwin.
Congratulations Kamali

1886
02:18:30,865 --> 02:18:31,345
Thank you

1887
02:18:31,385 --> 02:18:33,465
You certainly have the wings of Fire!

1888
02:18:33,545 --> 02:18:35,825
And you're the champions! How does it feel?

1889
02:18:38,905 --> 02:18:39,585
It's your day

1890
02:18:42,745 --> 02:18:44,945
I have no words to
express my feelings

1891
02:18:46,545 --> 02:18:48,825
I'm so thrilled...so excited!

1892
02:18:49,825 --> 02:18:51,505
Not because we won the competition...

1893
02:18:52,065 --> 02:18:54,225
but personally I won myself

1894
02:18:54,825 --> 02:18:56,545
My fears... my doubts...

1895
02:18:56,625 --> 02:19:00,345
It's a long journey for me from
Nadu Kaveri to IIT and here

1896
02:19:01,345 --> 02:19:02,945
It's a beautiful experience

1897
02:19:05,145 --> 02:19:07,345
Now, I feel myself as a confident girl

1898
02:19:08,345 --> 02:19:11,705
And I should really thank Ashwin for
being my inspiration. Thank you, Ashwin

1899
02:19:13,785 --> 02:19:15,465
And I want to say a few words in Tamil

1900
02:19:17,625 --> 02:19:21,425
There is someone whom I can't
thank enough with words

1901
02:19:21,545 --> 02:19:22,145
Nambi sir

1902
02:19:22,985 --> 02:19:23,785
My mentor

1903
02:19:24,665 --> 02:19:26,785
He is the sole reason, I
am standing here today

1904
02:19:28,465 --> 02:19:30,825
I can thank him only with
my actions and results

1905
02:19:34,145 --> 02:19:35,145
Thank you all

1906
02:19:36,065 --> 02:19:36,825
Thank you

1907
02:19:41,665 --> 02:19:43,945
You were skeptical to
educate a girl child...

1908
02:19:44,185 --> 02:19:46,665
but today Kamali is the identity
for the whole of Nadu Kaveri

1909
02:20:03,385 --> 02:20:05,145
Are you still in love with that boy?

1910
02:20:05,825 --> 02:20:06,305
I don't know

1911
02:20:08,025 --> 02:20:08,505
But...

1912
02:20:08,745 --> 02:20:10,305
Definitely he is my inspiration

1913
02:20:16,905 --> 02:20:19,385
And I should really thank
Ashwin for being my inspiration

1914
02:20:20,545 --> 02:20:22,465
Coffee! Coffee!

1915
02:20:22,505 --> 02:20:22,985
Excuse me

1916
02:20:23,505 --> 02:20:24,105
Just a minute

1917
02:20:26,385 --> 02:20:26,865
Kamali...

1918
02:20:29,185 --> 02:20:29,825
Coffee?

1919
02:20:36,665 --> 02:20:37,145
Ok

1920
02:20:39,185 --> 02:20:39,665
Thank you

1921
02:20:40,425 --> 02:20:42,185
Coffee! Coffee!

1922
02:21:05,385 --> 02:21:05,985
So, it's me?

1923
02:21:10,745 --> 02:21:11,225
May be
