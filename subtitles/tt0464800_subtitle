00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,632
Some look upon it as a wonder,

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,436
some describe it so,
others hear of it so,

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,909
but no one truly knows it.

5
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,196
Embracing

6
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,290
We take refuge at the guru's feet

7
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,891
We take refuge
with Amritanandamayi (Amma)

8
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:58,370
We take refuge at the guru's feet

9
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,966
We take refuge with Amrita (Amma)

10
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,654
Give her water. Not this.

11
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,990
Why are you giving her this?
It's a bad habit.

12
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,393
It's bad for her health.

13
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,365
Give her green leaves,
not sweet things.

14
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,264
Chew it!

15
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:27,036
Stop these bad habits.

16
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,487
The first time I met Amma
was in Paris.

17
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,593
I went because I'd heard about it
the week before.

18
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,036
When I arrived in the hall

19
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,475
with lots of people in white,
chanting,

20
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,537
and the books of her teachings,

21
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,276
I was a little afraid.

22
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,114
I wondered where I was,
who these people were.

23
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,314
And then...

24
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,291
I saw Indian families, with children,

25
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,157
and that reassured me.

26
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,253
I thought to myself,

27
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:49,233
"If there are Indians,
it means this is something traditional."

28
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,896
Then I saw children in Amma's arms,

29
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,600
their reaction
and her reaction to them,

30
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,576
and that put my mind at rest.

31
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:04,676
So I said to myself,
"She won't bite. Go for it!"

32
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,278
I went up and I was very moved.

33
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,657
But I didn't really understand.
I sat for a while then went home.

34
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,685
I didn't know I was supposed to stay.

35
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:24,498
I saw Amma again a few months later
when she returned.

36
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,940
For a while afterwards,
I sometimes had doubts.

37
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,602
I was scared.

38
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:36,877
Of the whole image thing,
the teacher, the people...

39
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,283
But I realised this entailed work.

40
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:47,919
Work regarding my upbringing
and what I had previously learnt.

41
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,021
I now have total peace of mind.

42
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,200
Having known Amma for a few years,

43
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,568
I am convinced,

44
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:05,373
from being close to her
and seeing her work,

45
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,541
of the purity of her intentions.

46
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,678
She is the irrefutable proof

47
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,177
that love truly exists.

48
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:21,455
Pure, unselfish, total,
infinite love.

49
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,150
Raise your hands
if you are without.

50
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,527
I have an announcement
about September 21.

51
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,075
- The buildings in New York...
- You mean September 11.

52
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,104
Listen to Amma first.

53
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,417
You know they were destroyed.

54
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,321
And now there are problems in Russia.

55
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,985
So for world peace,

56
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,485
phone and tell
your acquaintances...

57
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,861
It's 12 noon, right?

58
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,834
Tell them in e-mails,
on websites,

59
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,133
that for one minute,

60
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,038
people in shops,

61
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:50,038
in bathrooms, in bed,
in buses, wherever,

62
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,812
should pray for world peace.

63
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,012
I can't talk any louder,
I'm getting old.

64
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,649
All our branches should do that.

65
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,156
You should send out e-mails.

66
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,523
What is it?
I don't want it.

67
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,893
Like in Russia recently...

68
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,641
Terrorists are killing people
every day.

69
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,144
Even little children.

70
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,703
This is increasing.

71
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,115
The future looks bleak.

72
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,052
It's very dangerous,
so we must all pray.

73
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:08,349
We may not achieve peace,
but we shall pray for it.

74
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,970
In Russia it was a school.

75
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,505
Last week it was a school.

76
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,284
So let's pray.

77
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,291
We're heading
in the wrong direction.

78
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,671
We are going into the abyss.

79
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,360
Only divine grace can help us.

80
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,194
We shall pray.

81
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,174
Show us mercy.

82
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:13,310
One of the interesting things
about her is,

83
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:18,984
because of her love of all beings

84
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,222
Amma used to give her food away

85
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:28,256
to the birds and the animals.

86
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,291
She ate very little.

87
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,326
That's how she is.

88
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,362
The birds flew away when they saw us,

89
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:39,400
but came back when they saw Amma.

90
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,574
She used to meditate a lot.

91
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,610
Often, when we saw her like this,

92
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,488
we'd shake her,
but she wouldn't move.

93
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,687
Later, she would come in laughing.

94
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,718
The next morning,

95
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,754
in meditation,

96
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,791
she'd burst out crying and laughing.

97
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:08,795
We wondered if she had gone mental.

98
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,868
But a monk told us not to disturb her,

99
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:20,715
that she was in the ultimate
transcendental state: Bhava Samadhi.

100
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,343
Are you happy?

101
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,715
I'm happy because I have you.

102
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,015
How come you speak Malayalam?

103
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,392
Do you speak to people here
in Malayalam?

104
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,490
They told me,
"This is for Amma.

105
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:07,369
"Amma gives fruit as an offering.

106
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,896
"She'll give you sweets
as an offering,

107
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:15,573
"Amma gives everything."
They told me all that.

108
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,085
I learnt it by heart in Malayalam
so I could say it to Amma.

109
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,282
You got the offering?

110
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:31,728
You got it as they told you.

111
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,436
How many languages do you speak?

112
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,099
Five or six.

113
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,198
Which ones?

114
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,803
Kannada, Hindi, Tamil,
Telugu, Malayalam...

115
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,336
- English?
- English!

116
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,016
I realised early on

117
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:40,388
that there is an unchanged truth
for the changing universe.

118
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:57,240
Where I grew up as a child,
there were about 60 small houses.

119
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,709
I'd collect leftovers there.

120
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,508
In the evenings

121
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:08,975
I saw children of some families
lying around, tired and starving

122
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,888
while those of other families ate.

123
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:17,361
I also saw old people crying,

124
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:22,389
with no one to care for them,
wash their clothes or love them.

125
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,868
When I came face to face
with this life,

126
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:33,402
I wanted to die in fire, in pain.
Why was it like this? Was it their fate?

127
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:37,575
If someone falls into a pit
it's God's duty to help them.

128
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,709
That makes it my duty too.
That's how I began.

129
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:44,313
Let's pray that all sorrows
be removed from the world

130
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,947
and let out a sustained cry...

131
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,122
The poor girl's stiff from standing.

132
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,560
Everyone will have their turn.

133
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,258
I know you don't have
the energy to stand.

134
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:02,103
I thought I'd see you all,
even if I suffer.

135
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,372
But I don't have time
to give you Darshan or food.

136
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,936
Too many are here.
Fridays are like that.

137
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,711
I decided to give Darshan
on Fridays, food on Tuesdays,

138
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,947
but there are always too many people.

139
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,255
She's four
and hasn't started writing yet.

140
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,885
She'll start in her own time.

141
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,225
Mother, the house plans...

142
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,751
I saw them, I saw them.

143
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,661
Are they beautiful?

144
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,258
Are they enough, Mother?

145
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,394
You're a handsome boy!

146
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,562
It's enough that women
are attracted to you, not the house.

147
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,268
Who knows,
he may already have a love.

148
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,350
My child, my child...

149
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,951
There's no problem.

150
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,953
The pus will come out and it will dry.

151
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,896
Let it dry out.

152
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,659
My child...

153
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:40,233
Take some lemon rind and dry it.

154
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,798
- Won't they get upset?
- No. I asked them in advance.

155
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,604
Is it nice to ask?

156
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:50,740
Mother, I only told
thirty people that I know,

157
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:54,012
but they all wanted
to see you for Darshan.

158
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:59,479
My child, my child...
We'll give them food here.

159
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,651
Amma, I want to hug you.

160
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,059
He studies well,
but I'm afraid he's in love.

161
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,724
I'll retry in May.

162
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:13,027
If you quit that job,
what will you do?

163
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,651
Study hard, my child.

164
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,191
I want to open a shop.

165
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,558
Be careful.

166
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,076
She's trying to touch the elephant.

167
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:12,242
You've gained weight, haven't you?
Where's your father?

168
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,490
I put such problems in each episode.

169
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:13,799
- This one's...
- A waste. An utter waste.

170
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,635
What's "Amma Malayalam"?

171
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,699
Interviews with literary people.

172
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:22,940
I saw one with Prof. Bashkaran,
but just an interview.

173
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,111
If you had his songs in between,
it could be livelier.

174
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,883
You could insert his film songs.

175
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,255
- Like the first two lines?
- For example.

176
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,624
- This is good.
- Who's Mohan Nair?

177
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,323
He made Randu Penkuttikal,
Salini ente koottukaari...

178
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,924
Very good, positive stories.

179
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,527
People will be moved to tears.

180
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,402
Which way do we go?

181
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,569
I'll show you.

182
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:29,368
In Hinduism, creator and creation
are no different.

183
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,678
The creator is creation.

184
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:36,652
It's divine power that we see
in different forms.

185
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,554
The sea and the waves
are not different.

186
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,320
Waves originate from the sea.

187
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,790
When a sculptor sees a stone,

188
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:50,789
he sees a statue in his mind,
not a stone.

189
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:54,395
A bee sees honey, not the flower.

190
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:58,568
Thus I see the divine in everyone
and love and help them.

191
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,012
In my ears,

192
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,716
I hear the cries

193
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:18,251
of thousands of needy and poor.

194
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:22,288
But when I serve people,
I have no special experiences.

195
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,960
Nothing particular happens.

196
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:29,905
My mind is like butter
floating on water.

197
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,502
However I remain here
in this world,

198
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,445
my mind in my own hands.

199
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:24,050
"You have the right to act

200
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,426
but not to the fruit of action.

201
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,488
"Never make the fruit of action

202
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,464
your motive.

203
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:30,659
"Remain even-minded

204
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,034
in success and failure.

205
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,538
"Those whose motive is

206
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,268
the fruit of action deserve pity."

207
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,479
We were short of people

208
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:01,041
to wipe the women's faces.

209
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,917
Because we're asked to wipe faces

210
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,354
with too much sweat or make-up.

211
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,222
I arrived around 8 am,

212
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:13,457
thinking I'd stay a couple of hours.

213
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:18,525
But in fact, I was there
from 8 am to 4.30 pm,

214
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,229
when the Darshan finished.

215
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,295
I stood very close to Amma.

216
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:27,299
I wiped the faces
of women and children

217
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,403
during all that time.

218
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,846
Thousands of faces.

219
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:36,351
I had a very deep
emotional experience.

220
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,612
I was immerged

221
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:46,425
in that state of compassion and love.

222
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,454
In a flood of love.

223
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,931
My watch was moving

224
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,558
at an incredible pace.

225
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,303
Time ceased to exist.

226
00:55:55,618 --> 00:56:03,218
Oh my! I thought you were singing
in the Calcutta language!

227
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,643
Lead us from the unreal to the real

228
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,774
From darkness to light

229
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:50,513
From death to immortality

230
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:57,117
Om... peace, peace, peace

231
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:03,629
Om... May all beings find happiness

232
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:11,471
We pay tribute to the guru

233
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,800
True gurus live for their disciples.

234
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,362
They're patient to forgive
their disciples' weaknesses

235
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,897
and enlighten them.

236
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:48,206
They expect nothing
from their disciples.

237
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,506
These are true gurus.

238
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,911
But now, disciples merely copy them.

239
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,444
They seek to become like them.

240
01:00:55,485 --> 01:01:01,082
This can give gurus a bad name.

241
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,615
Gurus teach about the art of living.

242
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,796
Because there are two types
of education:

243
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,397
"Living", meaning your job,

244
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,001
and "life" which the gurus teach.

245
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:58,002
In the materialistic world,
teachers teach practical things.

246
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:04,179
In the spiritual world,
some things aren't clear.

247
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:12,025
Why are two spoons of tonic good
but a whole bottle dangerous?

248
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,889
Even if you travel with a map
bandits can still rob you.

249
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:21,700
Going to the moon
and learning about it are different.

250
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,202
I think we can stop there.

251
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,746
I don't want to discuss
the guru/disciple relationship

252
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,408
as people have differing views.

253
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:37,385
Say you go to a library
and pick out two books,

254
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,150
if they are both bad,

255
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:43,488
it doesn't mean
all the books there are bad.

256
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:47,524
But this is how people are now.

257
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,895
This is why I won't discuss it.

258
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:14,384
People ask why we die

259
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,999
despite the existence
of the supreme soul.

260
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:24,372
Death is only the failure
of the medium: The body.

261
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:28,810
The medium, or body,
is not strong.

262
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:36,214
In writing, we end a sentence
with a full stop

263
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,948
before starting the next one.

264
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,979
Death is like that full stop.

265
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:46,393
It doesn't mean an end.
We just go on to the next thing.

266
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,639
If one knows this principle,

267
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,172
then death is a joy.

268
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:13,951
It is a blissful experience,
like jumping into a pool.

269
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:18,520
We merely move on
to the next stage.

270
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:47,543
People say the River Ganges
is pure and divine.

271
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:51,212
Many mahatmas
have lived in Benares.

272
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:52,777
It's a divine place.

273
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:57,053
The mahatmas built
many temples there.

274
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:02,826
These great souls are like
transformers transmitting power.

275
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:09,027
If you go near a perfume factory,

276
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,802
you'll smell of that perfume.

277
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,639
So there's a good atmosphere.

278
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:20,547
Many people come here
with that belief in order to pray.

279
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,780
So naturally,
it becomes a place of grandeur,

280
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,482
with all these people
in concentrated prayer.

281
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:31,152
Concentrated prayer
certainly creates a power.

282
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,321
Like in Italy,

283
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:38,197
where St Francis of Assisi
prayed and died.

284
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,065
Many people go there to pray.

285
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:43,765
Benares is like that.

286
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:47,333
Many ascetics
go into samadhi there.

287
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:43,048
Divine mother,

288
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,110
give me devotion,

289
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,315
give me love,

290
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:51,417
protect me by giving me faith.
Say this prayer.

291
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,847
In Rama's age,

292
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:22,721
devils lived closer,
in a neighbouring land.

293
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:25,784
In Krishna's age,
devils lived in our families.

294
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:29,628
Now they are even closer,
they are inside us.

295
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,656
These devils,

296
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:37,070
we must kill them to succeed.

297
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:40,302
They are arrogance,
selfishness and greed.

298
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:45,006
To gain peace of mind,
we must be ready to battle.

299
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:48,483
Not to battle with real weapons,

300
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:52,920
but with love,
devotion and sacrifice.

301
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:58,723
A battle without bloodshed.
Only peace and love.

302
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,854
Look at our society.

303
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,592
We spend a lot of money

304
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:09,002
travelling to the depths
of the oceans and space to study them.

305
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:12,404
But we never travel
to our inner world,

306
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:17,003
which is so close at hand.

307
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:20,105
Everyone loves TVs
with bigger screens.

308
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:24,312
But as the screens get bigger,
our hearts get smaller.

309
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:29,757
We have vacuum cleaners
that suck up

310
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:34,160
the tiniest dirt.

311
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:38,098
Yet we are not ready
to clean the dirt from our minds.

312
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:43,400
Our minds make our lives
beautiful or ugly.

313
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:47,169
We try to learn
about the outside world,

314
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:51,202
but never the inner world.

315
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:56,183
We try to right the outside world
and forget to right ourselves.

316
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,745
We are slaves to the outside world.

317
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:03,280
We bear many physical
and mental scars.

318
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,919
We bear many unhealed wounds.

319
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:10,523
Total happiness cannot come
from the outside world.

320
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:14,764
It's like trying to hold the sky
or sail across land.

321
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:18,330
Life is short,
we must try to celebrate it.

322
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:22,139
You hold only this moment
in your hands.

323
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,461
Sensual feelings are fleeting.

324
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:46,235
Unaffected by them is the wise man,

325
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:51,041
who, equating pleasure and pain,

326
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:53,512
attains immortality.

327
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:59,919
That day Amma took 45000 people

328
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:03,321
into her arms for 21 hours.

329
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,751
23 million people

330
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:13,597
have received Amma's Darshan.
