1
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,083
- Let's not spend too much.
- Okay.

2
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,083
- Do you have kurta-pajamas?
- Yes. What kind do you want?

3
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,291
Not too dressy, but not too plain.

4
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,791
Show me some simple ones.

5
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,833
How much is this?

6
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,291
750 rupees.

7
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,333
Show me that white one.

8
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,458
The one at the top.

9
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,708
How's this?

10
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,166
It's nice.

11
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,666
Do check the fitting of the pajamas.

12
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,708
You need to sit comfortably on stage.

13
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,500
Thank you for the warning, Grandma.
I've never bought clothes before.

14
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,458
Mind if I try them on and sit down?

15
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,708
How can I let you, sir? They'll get dirty.

16
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,083
Should I try on a shawl too?

17
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,500
Shawl? Why just a shawl?

18
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,208
Flaunt some diamond rings
and gold chains as well on stage.

19
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,208
You think the judges
will give you points for your clothes?

20
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,458
Father always said, "Once you're on stage,

21
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,666
everything is part of the performance."

22
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,625
Our next contestant is Sharad Nerulkar.

23
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,833
I'm presenting <i>Raag Bageshree,</i>

24
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,583
a traditional composition in fast tempo.

25
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,583
Are you busy?

26
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,916
What the hell, <i>Ajji?</i> Can't you see?

27
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,541
Your mother is on the phone. Talk to her.

28
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,416
I'll call her later.

29
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,375
You've been saying
"later, later" for so many days.

30
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,208
Stop bugging me.
I said I'd call her later.

31
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,916
She's saying you
haven't answered her calls in three days.

32
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,125
My phone wasn't working.

33
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,166
Viju has been unwell for many days.

34
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,125
What can I do from here?
She'll just have to deal with it.

35
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,958
Go and visit her.

36
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,333
<i>Ajji,</i> my competition is in two days.

37
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,458
Please let me practice.
Tell her I will call her.

38
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,666
Tell her yourself. Don't involve me.

39
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,416
I keep getting caught
between the two of you.

40
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,125
Such a headache.

41
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,000
Is that any reason to start crying now?

42
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:30,708
<i>Saints and ascetics
have attained this music</i>

43
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,333
<i>after thousands of years
of rigorous spiritual pursuit.</i>

44
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,208
<i>It cannot be learnt so easily.</i>

45
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,541
<i>Even ten lifetimes are not enough.</i>

46
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,708
<i>The sacred texts don't merely prescribe,</i>

47
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,083
<i>"This</i> Raag <i>uses the</i> Pancham,"

48
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,375
<i>or, "That</i> Raag <i>skips the</i> Dhaivat."

49
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,916
<i>Through this music,</i>

50
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,333
<i>we are shown the path to the Divine.</i>

51
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,125
<i>There's a reason
why Indian classical music</i>

52
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,500
<i>is considered an Eternal Quest.</i>

53
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,583
<i>And to embark on that quest,</i>

54
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,833
<i>you will have to surrender and sacrifice.</i>

55
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,666
<i>If you want to earn money,</i>

56
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,000
<i>raise a family,</i>

57
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,500
<i>then perform love songs or film songs.</i>

58
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,833
<i>Don't tread this path.</i>

59
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,250
<i>If you want to walk this path,</i>

60
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,833
<i>learn to be lonely and hungry.</i>

61
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,916
Here.

62
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,791
Do you need anything else?

63
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,333
No.

64
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,000
I heard that Sumit Khade
from Nagpur is competing too.

65
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,750
He has solid training.

66
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,041
Why are you saying this in front of him?

67
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,666
I met Rishi and Kruti outside.

68
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,791
They're so sly.

69
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,625
I casually asked them
what <i>Raag</i> they're performing today.

70
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,250
They just didn't reply.
Avoided the subject totally.

71
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,875
- Drop it now.
- Sharad Nerulkar?

72
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,750
Sharad?

73
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,166
- All the best.
- Yes.

74
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,083
I'm presenting <i>Raag Bageshree.</i>

75
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,083
A traditional composition in fast tempo.

76
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,958
Thanks.

77
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,583
Bravo! What a performance.

78
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,125
Our next contestant is Nitin Avasthe.

79
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,083
That was good.

80
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,625
- Honestly?
- Yes. It was good.

81
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,958
Was the reverb too much?
I couldn't tell from the stage.

82
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,708
No, it was fine.

83
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,750
Let's give him a big hand.

84
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,041
And the much awaited moment

85
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,791
has finally arrived.

86
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,125
The judges have come to a decision.

87
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,875
To present the Gupte Builders Awards

88
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,041
for Young Performer 2006,

89
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,875
I invite
Mr. Dattatreya Kirloskar on stage.

90
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,750
A big round of applause.

91
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,125
He is the son of
Maestro Balkrishna Kirloskar.

92
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,375
He is a little late, but he has come
all the way from Mulund to be with us.

93
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:44,750
I request Mr. Dattatreya
to present the winners with a trophy.

94
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,416
The third prize goes to Namita Satam.

95
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,416
The second prize goes to Sumit Khade.

96
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,458
And today's ultimate,
most important award,

97
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:17,083
The winner of Young Performer 2006 is…

98
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,375
Chinmayee Wadhawkar!

99
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,791
Hearty congratulations
to the winners from Gupte Builders.

100
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,500
A huge round of applause.

101
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,291
As you breathe in,
think positive thoughts.

102
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,541
As you breathe out,

103
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,166
let go of any negative thoughts.

104
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,666
Now we will meditate.

105
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,791
Do not stop any thoughts.

106
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,708
Now we will start the breathing exercise.

107
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,708
<i>A restless mind</i>

108
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,083
<i>simply cannot sing</i> Khayal <i>music</i>

109
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,708
<i>with depth and authenticity.</i>

110
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,875
<i>To worship every note,</i>

111
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,791
<i>every microtone,</i>

112
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:56,041
<i>your mind has to be pure and unblemished.</i>

113
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,458
<i>What is</i> Khayal?

114
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,333
<i>It is the state of mind of the singer</i>

115
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,791
<i>at that time, in that particular moment.</i>

116
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:15,458
<i>He presents that state
through the medium of a</i> Raag.

117
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:21,125
<i>While singing, you yourself don't know</i>

118
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,500
<i>which new aspect</i>

119
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:28,500
<i>of the</i> Raag <i>you will uncover.</i>

120
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:38,166
<i>If you want the Truth of the</i> Raag
<i>to spontaneously reveal itself,</i>

121
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,625
<i>you will have to rid
your mind of falsehood,</i>

122
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:46,625
<i>greed, and impure thoughts.</i>

123
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,000
<i>Not everyone has the inherent discipline</i>

124
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,958
<i>and faith required for this…</i>

125
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,500
You're still at it?

126
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,666
Enough of this Maai saga now.

127
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,458
What saga? This is also work, isn't it?

128
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,333
These are hour-long tapes.
Obviously it will take time.

129
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Do those later.

130
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,916
Have you completed
the Sadarang Conference ones?

131
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,333
Yes, '72 and '74 are done.

132
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,791
I can't find the '73 tape.

133
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,416
How can that be?

134
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,416
It was right here. I saw it the other day.

135
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,291
I haven't seen it.

136
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,500
That one has
Rambhau Arolkar's <i>Basant-Bahar</i> on it.

137
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,125
He sang it so well.

138
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,708
That man was a master of combining <i>Raags.</i>

139
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,541
Look for that tape.

140
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,125
We have an order
to make a CD box set, 1972 to 1975.

141
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,583
How many?

142
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,958
Make a master. Then we'll do 30-40 sets.

143
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,041
MAAI'S SPEECHES

144
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,833
Do you have any Shankar Bhatt CDs?

145
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,916
No, sir.

146
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,416
How about Sultan Saheb?

147
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,458
No, they are out of stock.

148
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,791
Then what would you recommend?

149
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:34,291
Actually, sir, we specialize
in rare and lesser-known records.

150
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,958
All these CDs have been
converted from old cassettes and LPs.

151
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,500
I've never heard of these names.

152
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,458
Yes, sir, but they are
as good as the famous names.

153
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,416
For example,
this is Ustad Nissar Aslam Shaikh

154
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,750
of the Agra tradition.

155
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,875
He had the same guru as Sultan Saheb.

156
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,958
But he didn't get as much recognition.

157
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,458
- How much is it?
- 150 rupees.

158
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,166
No, thanks.

159
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,000
Sir, we also have an offer on right now,

160
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,125
a 12-CD pack
of All India Radio recordings.

161
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,416
The regular price is 1,500 rupees.
With our discount, it's only 1,000.

162
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,833
No, thank you.

163
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,583
Do you have any devotional music?

164
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,166
We don't, right?

165
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,666
No, only classical music.

166
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,791
I'll come back during the interval.

167
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,416
Everyone wants devotional stuff.

168
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,916
Should we go in and listen?

169
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,666
Are you nuts?

170
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,875
Your ears will start bleeding.

171
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,958
It's fucking nonsense!

172
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,500
How low can you stoop
for this hoity-toity crowd?

173
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,291
What the heck was he playing today?

174
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,125
And the audience was clapping away.

175
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,083
All these "annual membership" types…

176
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,375
They'll applaud
for anyone playing anything.

177
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,958
And even the artistes
have no musical standpoint.

178
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,583
It's like an assorted buffet…

179
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,833
A serious <i>Raag</i> for 20 minutes, a light one
for 15, a love song, a devotional one.

180
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:35,916
Done.

181
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,958
But the sponsors love it.

182
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,208
Screw the sponsors.

183
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,083
They push the same
four, five famous names.

184
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,083
All the shows go to them
and everything sounds the same.

185
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:52,250
No matter what the <i>Raag,</i>
it's the same structure, same gimmicks.

186
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,750
All predictable.

187
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,333
Rice, please.

188
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,833
But I don't get it.

189
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,791
Shakir Bhai used to play so beautifully.

190
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,333
I've heard his recordings from the '80s.

191
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,791
So much poise, such clarity of notes.

192
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,541
How can someone change so much?

193
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,750
For money, what else?

194
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,958
That's why Guruji, Maai,

195
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,250
never got into
this concert circuit racket.

196
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,875
What?

197
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,041
What's wrong?

198
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,708
I don't know.

199
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:47,833
What do you mean?

200
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,750
I couldn't come up with new phrases.

201
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,083
It was repetitive, wasn't it?

202
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,208
Why is it repetitive?

203
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,083
I don't know.

204
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,750
You practiced, right?

205
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:04,958
Yes.

206
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,333
Then why are you stuck?

207
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,125
Try again.

208
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,583
I'm just repeating myself.

209
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,083
You sing.

210
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,375
Good.

211
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,750
Well done.

212
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,291
Listen.

213
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,500
Just let him go, please.

214
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,375
His friends have been calling him.

215
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,333
Do you want to go?

216
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:15,625
Yes, of course.

217
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,375
Obviously. Even on a Sunday
you're forcing him to learn music.

218
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,625
What else?

219
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,625
What's wrong with that?

220
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:26,708
Ustad Saheb would even
beat his children till they got it right.

221
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:30,458
- We've heard this story a hundred times.
- But it's true.

222
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,625
He'd tie their hair to a nail on the wall.

223
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:36,083
We're just enjoying ourselves, right?

224
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:40,208
I'll teach you a traditional composition
in the same <i>Raag.</i> Hold the note.

225
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,166
Very good.

226
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,083
Shaardya.

227
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,541
Come on. Everyone's waiting.

228
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,041
Hey, come inside.

229
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:03,958
No, I'm good.

230
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,291
Come on now. Sit.

231
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,208
I'm teaching him what we call a <i>bandish.</i>

232
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,083
Uncle, I don't understand any of this.

233
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,500
Can Shaardya come with me?

234
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,458
A <i>bandish</i> is a very valuable composition.

235
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,541
When two musicians got married,

236
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,666
these compositions
were gifted as the dowry.

237
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,208
They used to be
as precious as life itself.

238
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,750
Why are you torturing these kids?

239
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,583
Just let them go and play.

240
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:37,666
<i>Go fly, fly away to your home</i>

241
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:43,750
<i>Go fly, fly away to your home…</i>

242
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:48,333
Five, four, three, two, one.

243
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,541
Welcome back to our show <i>Gharana.</i>

244
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,083
Before the break,

245
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:05,083
Mr. Mukund shed some light on
the history of the Alwar school of music.

246
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:09,625
Mr. Mukund is not only
a singer trained in the Alwar style,

247
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:14,875
he has also written a book
on the history of its music,

248
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,541
entitled <i>The Eternal Flame.</i>

249
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,375
<i>Mr. Mukund, let me now
turn to another subject.</i>

250
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:27,625
<i>In your book, you have written about
how this music has changed over time</i>

251
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:31,666
<i>and how it has
somehow lost its essence today.</i>

252
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,666
<i>It is true.</i>

253
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:37,666
<i>A lot of people
did not like me writing this.</i>

254
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,625
<i>I have even been criticized for it.</i>

255
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:46,208
<i>But if people want to listen to
this music today, where can they find it?</i>

256
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:48,958
<i>They won't find it.</i>

257
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:56,208
<i>It is almost impossible
to find that kind of music today,</i>

258
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,875
<i>that divine purity.</i>

259
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:03,125
<i>My guru,
Maestro Vinayak Pradhan, always tells me</i>

260
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,666
<i>that if you wanted
to experience Ustad's music,</i>

261
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,083
<i>there was only one person,
Maestra Sindhubai Jadhav.</i>

262
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,333
<i>We lovingly refer to her as "Maai."</i>

263
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,458
<i>Our guru says that his music</i>

264
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,625
<i>does not even come close to her genius.</i>

265
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,458
<i>Why was she so special?</i>

266
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,958
<i>I've asked Guruji
this question many times.</i>

267
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:34,916
<i>He says that it is impossible
to describe her music in words.</i>

268
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,250
<i>- But aren't there any recordings?
- No.</i>

269
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,916
<i>Maai never allowed
anyone to record her music.</i>

270
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:47,250
<i>There's barely
a photo of her, let alone interviews.</i>

271
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:51,000
<i>She was different. She was an ascetic.</i>

272
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,541
What a cutie you were as a kid.

273
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,625
Very sweet.

274
00:32:58,625 --> 00:32:59,958
And what about now?

275
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,416
Why didn't you show me this before?

276
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,041
I've heard so much about your father,
but this is the first time I've seen him.

277
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,666
This was on VHS till now.

278
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,375
I just transferred it yesterday.

279
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,208
I want to listen to your father singing.

280
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,875
His stories were more interesting.

281
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,791
His singing was okay.

282
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,041
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

283
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:33,583
Tejas told me that your father
had some old tapes of Maai.

284
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,333
What tapes?

285
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,791
Of lectures that she gave
her senior disciples in Belgaum.

286
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,958
But how can there be tapes?

287
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:45,458
Apparently, Karim Saheb
recorded them secretly.

288
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,083
Yes, Dad mentioned this once.

289
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,041
But I've never seen any tapes like that.

290
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,250
Never mind.
Have you shared this with your mom?

291
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,833
You should. She'll be so happy.

292
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,125
You know how sentimental she is about Dad?

293
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,208
This will make it even worse.

294
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,791
I'll leave now. It's late.

295
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:38,541
Do not stop
the flow of thoughts in your mind.

296
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:42,083
Just observe them.

297
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:47,125
Let your repressed emotions

298
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:49,291
come to the fore.

299
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,708
Good, bad, all of them.

300
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:58,708
They exist. Just observe them.

301
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:09,583
Just like your mind,
your body is trying to converse with you.

302
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,541
Try to listen to it.

303
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,250
I wanted to tell you something.

304
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,291
But I just can't remember it.

305
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:46,291
If it's the electricity bill,
I'll pay it today.

306
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,750
No, no. Not the bill.

307
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,083
It was something else.

308
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,583
Was it about your medicines?

309
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:55,208
No, not the medicines either.

310
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,958
Forget it. I can't remember.

311
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,083
Did you speak to your mother?

312
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,791
I spoke to her just yesterday.

313
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:04,875
What did she say?

314
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,875
That everything is fine.

315
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:12,041
I just don't understand her.

316
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,833
She says one thing to you,
another thing to me,

317
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:17,750
and has something
totally different on her mind.

318
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,500
What's happened now?

319
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,625
She was crying on the phone yesterday.

320
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,375
She said I should have a talk with you.

321
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,208
About what?

322
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,583
About getting a job.

323
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,166
But I'm working with Kishore now.

324
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,250
I told her the same thing.

325
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,375
But she said, "That's not a real job."

326
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:40,500
"Kishore pays him peanuts," and so on.

327
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,625
Did she say this, or are you saying it?

328
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,875
Why would I say it?

329
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,208
How does she know how much I earn?

330
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,083
I haven't told her.

331
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:55,291
But she knows
that we're always short of money.

332
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,083
The rent on that house, Viju's fees…

333
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:01,000
How much can she take care of alone?

334
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:05,083
Don't hide behind Mum, okay?

335
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:08,708
If you can't afford
me living here, just say so.

336
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,958
I'll leave right away.

337
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,666
Why are you talking like this?

338
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,000
We're only concerned for your future.

339
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,250
Look, <i>Ajji,</i> I can either
pursue my music, or I can have a job.

340
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,041
I can't do both.

341
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:22,958
Why can't you?

342
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:26,583
Don't all your friends have jobs?

343
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,333
Doesn't Tejas work? Doesn't Sneha work?

344
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,625
But I don't want to.

345
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,416
I'll leave the house if you want.

346
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,166
That's no way to behave.

347
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,333
You're as stubborn as your father.

348
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,666
And how he suffered later on.

349
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,666
Don't compare me with Dad.

350
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:50,458
If I don't make it,
I won't go around blaming the whole world.

351
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,541
I don't know what to say to this boy.

352
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,583
Guruji, should we start?

353
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,666
Okay, we are ready to begin.

354
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:18,250
I know many of you are here
because of the article I wrote last week.

355
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:23,458
And I really wasn't exaggerating when I
said that this man is an unsung genius.

356
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,000
A hidden gem of Mumbai.

357
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:29,458
Guruji, I thank you
on behalf of all of us here tonight

358
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,333
for agreeing to perform for us.

359
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:36,291
I think I'm gonna stop talking now
and let Guruji create his magic.

360
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:44,041
Whatever Reena just said in English…

361
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,791
I didn't understand most of it.

362
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:52,000
But I will attempt to sing
something decent for you all.

363
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,916
No, you are not listening.

364
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,375
Sing with an open throat.

365
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,375
Get up.

366
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,916
His blood pressure is low, that's all.

367
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:44,916
How low?

368
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,375
It's at 60. Last time it was 80.

369
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,458
Oh, God.

370
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,958
Any other complaints?

371
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:55,333
My back hurts a lot,
here on the lower side.

372
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:00,000
And urine, stools? All normal?

373
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:04,791
Yes, that's all fine. Just this backache.

374
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,916
And what about the coughing?

375
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Oh, yes.

376
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:14,583
Sometimes, at night,
I start coughing a lot.

377
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:18,458
Once it starts, it just doesn't stop.

378
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:22,208
Do you feel cold then? Or feverish?

379
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,791
No, just the cough.

380
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Okay.

381
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,500
Take this medication

382
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,166
and drop by next month.

383
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,125
Yes.

384
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,666
I've prescribed
a painkiller for your back.

385
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:42,333
Only take it
if the pain is severe, otherwise avoid it.

386
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,166
And keep drinking plenty of water.

387
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,833
- Do you exercise?
- No.

388
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,208
Then take him for a walk,
at least two to three times a week.

389
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,875
Yes, Doctor.

390
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,333
How much do I owe you?

391
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,833
Including the last visit, 450 rupees.

392
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,875
Is it okay if I pay you next week?

393
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,500
- That's fine.
- No. I have it.

394
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:16,791
- You can give it to me later, it's okay.
- It's no problem.

395
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,375
What's wrong?

396
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,416
Nothing.

397
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,416
Are you upset?

398
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,791
No. You just take care of your health.

399
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,708
That's not what I'm talking about.

400
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,333
I'm talking about the other night.

401
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:46,291
What about it?

402
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,375
Were you upset?

403
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:53,416
No, I was angry with myself, that's all.

404
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,416
What's there to be angry about?

405
00:45:56,916 --> 00:46:00,541
Your voice was not at its best, so what?

406
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:07,583
- Did someone say something to you?
- No.

407
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,916
Why are you so restless?

408
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,166
Where are you rushing to?

409
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:23,166
This is the age to practice
and that's what you should do.

410
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,166
I do nothing but practice,

411
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,625
and yet this keeps happening.

412
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,458
Then I get angry with myself.

413
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,291
Really? You're getting angry already?

414
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,750
How old are you?

415
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:43,833
Twenty-four.

416
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,458
Till the age of 40, we never
thought about anything but practice.

417
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,583
We could not
utter a single word in front of Maai.

418
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:57,166
We just kept our heads down and sang.

419
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,125
And you want everything in a hurry?

420
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:02,916
No.

421
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,333
Did Kishore tell you
about the Teachers' Day concert?

422
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,291
Yes. Tejas and Sneha
are performing, right?

423
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,291
And you are not?

424
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:20,000
Kishore didn't say anything to me.

425
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:24,083
- Of course you'll be singing too.
- Okay.

426
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:27,500
- Start preparing.
- Yes.

427
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,250
Damn, it's really cold.

428
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,458
We'll be shivering in the morning.

429
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,375
This is the perfect weather

430
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:53,833
for those hot potato patties
and some tea at Ramdas.

431
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:58,208
Actually, he is traveling all the way
just for those Ramdas patties.

432
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,916
He's not interested in the concert at all.

433
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,041
Yes, of course.

434
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,458
I've heard the Maestro umpteen times.

435
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,166
The real joy is in the patties.

436
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,666
The rice flakes there
are excellent too, with fried peanuts.

437
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,500
So I'm the fool.

438
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,041
I thought we were traveling
in the middle of the night

439
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,833
to listen to the Maestro,

440
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:20,541
but you guys are on a food trip.

441
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,875
Look, with the Maestro it's 50-50.

442
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,750
When he's good, he is very good.

443
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:30,250
When he's bad, it's really unbearable.

444
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:34,083
It's 50-50 because he is a genius.

445
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:38,458
Every performance he tries
something new, always experimenting.

446
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:41,625
When it works, you hit the jackpot.

447
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:44,916
Yes, but that's why you have to
go and listen to him ten times.

448
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,291
And only four
of those times would be worth it.

449
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,458
I have a feeling
he's going to play well today.

450
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:54,000
It's beautiful there,
in the midst of nature.

451
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,750
Nature has nothing to do with it.

452
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,333
He needs his rum.

453
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,916
If that has
been arranged, he'll play well.

454
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,333
Come on. Rum at sunrise?

455
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:07,458
It doesn't matter
whether it's day or night,

456
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,583
once he's chugged two pegs,

457
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,041
his hands start to play.

458
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:15,333
Papa, what <i>Raag</i> will he play today?

459
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,833
You're still awake?

460
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,208
Go back to sleep.

461
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,750
Otherwise you'll be
dozing off during the concert.

462
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:25,625
You tell me, which are the morning <i>Raags?</i>

463
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,291
<i>- Todi…</i>
- And?

464
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:33,125
<i>- Bhairav…</i>
- And?

465
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,833
If you can name two more <i>Raags,</i>

466
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:42,250
I will give you chocolates in the morning.

467
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,833
<i>Lalit?</i>

468
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,958
Good! One more.

469
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:51,250
<i>- Marwa?
- Marwa</i> is a morning <i>Raag?</i>

470
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:52,333
No.

471
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,125
I don't know any more.

472
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:58,500
You mentioned <i>Bhairav.</i> A similar one?

473
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,416
<i>Ahir Bhairav.</i>

474
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Correct.

475
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:03,791
Don't forget to get that chocolate.

476
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:05,375
Now go to sleep.

477
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:06,583
But you woke me up.

478
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:08,708
Okay, okay. Now sleep.

479
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:15,083
There's another story
about the Maestro and <i>Lalit.</i>

480
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:18,166
Shubho from Kolkata told me.

481
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:22,666
Once, he had
a 5:00 a.m. slot at Dover Lane.

482
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,000
He announced that
he would be playing <i>Lalit.</i>

483
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,000
Someone from the audience said,

484
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:32,291
"You played it just last week in Delhi."

485
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,708
"Play something else."

486
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,250
He replied,

487
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:41,416
"Not just last week, I have been playing
only <i>Lalit</i> for the last two months."

488
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,875
"That <i>Raag</i> is upset with me."

489
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,916
"I've been trying
very hard to woo it back."

490
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:51,791
They say he played
such a magnificent <i>Lalit</i> that day,

491
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,750
the entire crowd was mesmerized.

492
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,291
Wow.

493
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:01,416
He's a mad fucker.

494
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,416
What's going on? Are you okay?

495
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,166
I'm fine.

496
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,208
Here, drink some warm water.

497
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:27,750
- You wait outside, I'll come.
- Okay.

498
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,708
Here, have a cough drop.

499
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:03,833
No, I don't want it.

500
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,125
You're not wearing your kurta?

501
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,791
I'll wear it there.

502
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,416
- It'll get crumpled on the way.
- Let's go.

503
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,666
Give me your blessings.

504
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,458
Why here? There's still time.

505
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,333
I'll go by bike. You come later.

506
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:17,583
But I'm ready to leave.

507
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:19,750
I need some silence on the way.

508
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,458
I won't utter a word.

509
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:24,125
Please come on your own.

510
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,416
And your kurta?

511
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:27,416
Sorry.

512
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
- Should I carry it?
- No.

513
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,666
Wait. I'll get some sweet yoghurt.

514
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,000
Yoghurt before singing? Really?

515
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,750
Then some sugar for good luck.

516
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,291
I'll see you there.

517
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,083
<i>If you want to learn my music,</i>

518
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:04,000
<i>then forget about
the audience and other such notions.</i>

519
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:11,208
<i>I do not sing
for the audience or for patrons.</i>

520
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,583
<i>I have no interest in showing off</i>

521
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:17,958
<i>how many complex</i> Raags <i>I have mastered</i>

522
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:21,916
<i>or how much training I have.</i>

523
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:28,416
<i>I sing only for my Guru</i>

524
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,083
<i>and for God.</i>

525
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,708
<i>The other day someone asked me,</i>

526
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:40,583
<i>"Maai, but shouldn't we choose the</i> Raag

527
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:44,375
<i>depending on the audience present?"</i>

528
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,583
<i>I said, "There are 200 people in a room."</i>

529
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,458
<i>"And 200 people have 200 minds."</i>

530
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,791
<i>"How many people will you try to please?"</i>

531
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:01,125
<i>"Are you a circus monkey?"</i>

532
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:07,250
<i>We have plenty of posers around</i>

533
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:12,750
<i>who perform all sorts of vocal acrobatics
in the name of classical music.</i>

534
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:20,500
<i>Fortunately, that's not
the kind of training I got from my Guruji.</i>

535
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,083
<i>He would always say,</i>

536
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:27,750
<i>"Once you close your eyes
and utter the first note,</i>

537
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:34,208
<i>nothing other than the</i> Raag
<i>must be allowed to enter your mind."</i>

538
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:40,458
<i>"Then it does not matter,
even if you fail that day…</i>

539
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:46,333
<i>because at least
you tried with sincerity."</i>

540
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,833
Greetings.

541
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:01,625
I'd like to welcome you all
to this Teachers' Day celebration.

542
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,000
It is an auspicious day

543
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:09,083
to celebrate the age-old
master-disciple tradition.

544
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:14,208
Maestro Vinayak Pradhan
of the Alwar lineage

545
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:19,500
has trained several students
in music over the past 40 years.

546
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:25,166
Today, five of his young students

547
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,916
will present their music.

548
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:32,291
The program begins with Sharad Nerulkar.

549
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,958
He is accompanied
on the tabla by Amar Moghe.

550
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:48,250
And on the harmonium is Tushar Modak.

551
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:55,583
With Guruji's permission, let's begin.

552
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:11,375
<i>He who has faith
in Saraswati, the Goddess of Music,</i>

553
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:14,791
<i>will surely be blessed by her.</i>

554
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:19,708
<i>You don't just practice the music,</i>

555
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:25,708
<i>but also endurance and perseverance.</i>

556
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:32,250
<i>Because this journey is long and arduous.</i>

557
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:36,250
<i>I have seen the best of them</i>

558
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:39,625
<i>give up midway.</i>

559
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:45,166
<i>There will be a thousand occasions
to succumb and accept defeat.</i>

560
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:48,833
<i>But you must not.</i>

561
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:54,708
<i>He who has control over his mind…</i>

562
01:01:55,625 --> 01:02:02,125
<i>can never be swayed from his path,
no matter what the circumstances.</i>

563
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,625
Don't look directly at the lens.

564
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:08,291
Should we do a casual one?

565
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,208
As if you're enjoying it?

566
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,541
Or do you only want a serious look?

567
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,333
No, let's do it.

568
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,041
Yeah, that way you'll have more options.

569
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,750
Sure. What should I do?

570
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:20,625
Turn this way a little.

571
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,750
No, not that much. A little less. Yes.

572
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:25,916
Perfect.

573
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,500
Look here and smile.

574
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:39,041
No, no, not just a smile, smile and sing.

575
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,250
As if you're enjoying singing.

576
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:02,166
Good! It's nicely done. Who made it?

577
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,416
A friend of mine.

578
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,958
Send me his number.

579
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,875
We want to make a website too.

580
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:11,750
Actually we have one,

581
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:14,166
but no one has updated it for two years.

582
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,333
Sure, I'll give you his details.

583
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:22,333
As I was passing by,
I thought I should drop in.

584
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,500
I'm glad you did. Do come by sometimes.

585
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:30,000
I wanted to invite you personally.

586
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:31,875
Really? To what?

587
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:35,916
- To my performance at Kalyan next Sunday.
- Nice!

588
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,708
I thought I should invite you.

589
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:44,333
I'll come. Message me the details.

590
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:46,291
I've got you an invite.

591
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:58,208
I'd be happy if you came.

592
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,500
We'll also organize a show with you.

593
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,125
Oh, thank you.

594
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,500
Nowadays, people
come to listen to newcomers.

595
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,583
Yes.

596
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:19,000
- We did a "Woman Power" show recently.
- I see.

597
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,541
The turnout was good.

598
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,708
I see. I couldn't attend that one.

599
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,291
Shahana and Gayatri performed.

600
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:30,250
- I see.
- It went well.

601
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:38,625
Now we're thinking of doing
a "Diwali Dawn" show.

602
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:43,625
- We'll have you sing there.
- It would be my honor.

603
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:47,250
You, Aditya, Shivani…

604
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,625
a show with
two or three of you young performers.

605
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,000
Sure.

606
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:59,333
It's hard to find sponsors these days.

607
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:03,916
- For unknown names.
- Yes, that's true.

608
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:08,833
- But I'll let you know.
- Okay.

609
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:11,750
But do come for my program.

610
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:12,916
I will.

611
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:16,541
What is it? I'm in class.

612
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:19,708
What happened?

613
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,791
Is it bad?

614
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,041
What's the matter?

615
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:00,208
His joints are aching a lot.

616
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I see.

617
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,166
Guruji?

618
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,416
Are you feeling feverish?

619
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,125
No, there's no fever.

620
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:16,833
Okay.

621
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,458
Did you give him any medicine?

622
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:20,250
Yes, a painkiller.

623
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:22,833
How will just a painkiller help?

624
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,958
- Did you massage his legs?
- No.

625
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,791
Then what did you do all this time?

626
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,041
Just sit around?

627
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,000
Sorry, dada.

628
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,083
Leave now, both of you.

629
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,166
No, we can wait.

630
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,500
In case you need us to get something.

631
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,791
No, it's okay. You can go.

632
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:58,291
- Guruji, would you like to lie down?
- Yes.

633
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,375
Is it aching a lot?

634
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:17,541
Let's go to the doctor.

635
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:20,291
That useless doctor…

636
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:24,208
just keeps prescribing
medicines and charges so much.

637
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,458
That's not true at all.

638
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:29,166
In fact, he always takes less from us.

639
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:33,916
Last month, he prescribed
medicines worth 1,000 rupees.

640
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:37,791
I had to borrow money from Mukund.

641
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,583
I'll pay him back.

642
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:44,416
And please don't borrow from him.

643
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,000
Ask me for it.

644
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,333
He's very sly.

645
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:51,791
Whenever he lends you money, he calls me

646
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:54,333
and asks if Guruji can perform.

647
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,166
So what did you reply?

648
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,208
What can I say?

649
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:02,875
I tell him you're not up to it
these days and to not accept the shows.

650
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:05,750
I would have done it.

651
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:08,625
There's no need.

652
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,166
You suffer so much afterwards.

653
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:18,583
<i>Now we've had another instance
just yesterday in Jharkhand.</i>

654
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:21,833
<i>Two people killed allegedly
because they were cattle thieves.</i>

655
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:23,833
<i>Do you see a pattern emerging</i>

656
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:27,708
<i>in the manner in which these deaths
or lynchings are being carried out?</i>

657
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,291
<i>Or are they all very separate instances?</i>

658
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:33,291
Fame India
<i>has reached the City of Joy: Kolkata!</i>

659
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:37,416
<i>Thousands have turned up with hope
in their hearts and dreams in their eyes</i>

660
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,916
<i>in pursuit of the Golden Ticket.
Let's see who has impressed our judges.</i>

661
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,791
<i>Just when the judges had lost all hope…</i>

662
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,208
No.

663
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:02,250
<i>…in came a nervous, timid girl.</i>

664
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:05,708
<i>- Hi.
- Hello.</i>

665
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:07,333
<i>What's your name?</i>

666
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:10,458
<i>I am Shaswati Bose and I'm from Jhargram.</i>

667
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:13,791
<i>Okay. And what will you be singing for us?</i>

668
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:16,833
<i>I would like to attempt
Ustad Abdul Rashid Khan's song</i>

669
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:19,291
<i>"Aaye Aaye Sajana Mere."</i>

670
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:22,333
<i>I wish you all the best! Please start.</i>

671
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:03,041
<i>Okay. That's enough.</i>

672
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,708
<i>Shaswati, what you just sang…</i>

673
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:09,375
<i>What was that?</i>

674
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,291
<i>Why, sir? Was it not good?</i>

675
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,083
<i>No, it was not good.</i>

676
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:20,000
<i>It was very good! It was fabulous!</i>

677
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:24,791
<i>I agree. You have
a phenomenal voice. Phenomenal!</i>

678
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:29,125
<i>We're going to see you
in Mumbai! Congratulations!</i>

679
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:30,916
<i>Come here!</i>

680
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,458
<i>- Thank you.
- See you in Mumbai.</i>

681
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:51,541
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

682
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,916
<i>Our dream of seeing her sing on this show</i>

683
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,791
<i>has come true today. I'm very happy.</i>

684
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,583
Increase the monitor volume.

685
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,750
Give me more tanpuras in the monitor.

686
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,750
DIWALI MORNING WITH RISING STARS.

687
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:57,083
<i>I definitely want to
keep my writing and commentary</i>

688
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:59,416
<i>confined to music at this point in time.</i>

689
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,750
<i>I think it is our inability to</i>

690
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,375
<i>rationally view history</i>

691
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,541
<i>and separate it from what we do.</i>

692
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:08,833
<i>We always look for an explanation</i>

693
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:13,000
<i>as to who we are and how we fit into
our contemporary cultural context.</i>

694
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:52,916
<i>Do not get entangled in technicalities.</i>

695
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:59,125
<i>You may practice
endlessly for years and years</i>

696
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:02,458
<i>and gain complete mastery over technique,</i>

697
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:06,875
<i>but it will not lead you to the Truth.</i>

698
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:12,875
<i>Technique is merely a medium
to express your inner life.</i>

699
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,916
<i>Technique can be taught.</i>

700
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,250
<i>Truth cannot.</i>

701
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:23,083
<i>For that, you must have the strength</i>

702
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:26,833
<i>to look inwards with unflinching honesty.</i>

703
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:30,666
<i>This is extremely difficult.</i>

704
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,708
<i>It is a lifelong quest.</i>

705
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:36,125
<i>That is why we call it Asceticism.</i>

706
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:40,625
<i>And eventually,
when you do encounter the Truth,</i>

707
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,625
<i>it takes great courage to face it.</i>

708
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:47,958
<i>Because the Truth is often ugly.</i>

709
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:52,708
<i>Unless this awareness
seeps into your music…</i>

710
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:17,541
These phrases
could have been sung much better.

711
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:24,208
Once an idea has been
fully expressed, don't stretch it further.

712
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:29,000
Or else it sounds like
you're just filling up time.

713
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:35,250
Those organizers
also ruined my mood before the show.

714
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:39,875
No, it's not the organizers, Sharad.

715
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:42,916
Your perspective is lacking.

716
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:48,458
In some places,
you're embellishing it too much.

717
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,750
At other points, it's too bland.

718
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,041
It's all scattered.

719
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:01,125
You start off with one musical idea,

720
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:04,666
then you jump to something else,

721
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:07,791
and then some third thought pops up.

722
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:11,875
It's all jumbled up.

723
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:16,125
The music has no life in it.

724
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,791
It was the same problem last time.

725
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:26,458
Put more thought into your efforts.

726
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:27,916
It will work out gradually.

727
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:34,250
<i>How many years
are you going to waste like this?</i>

728
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,541
<i>How much longer?</i>

729
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:43,583
<i>Do you want to end up like your father?</i>

730
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:49,666
<i>Your father was my most faithful</i>

731
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:53,375
<i>but most incompetent student.</i>

732
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:57,041
<i>Nobody told him</i>

733
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:02,125
<i>that just by being
in the company of talented musicians,</i>

734
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:05,875
<i>and by publishing books about them,</i>

735
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,125
<i>you don't become talented yourself.</i>

736
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:11,750
<i>Till the very end,</i>

737
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,958
<i>he harbored many delusions.</i>

738
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,125
<i>But you are different, aren't you?</i>

739
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:20,333
<i>You understand better.</i>

740
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,875
<i>Guruji can't tell you this to your face.</i>

741
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:27,000
<i>He loves you.</i>

742
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,041
<i>He is dependent on you.</i>

743
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:31,875
<i>But you…</i>

744
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,041
May I sit?

745
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,125
Yes, please.

746
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:18,791
Yes?

747
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,583
Madam, I want to donate
these tapes to the center.

748
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:27,041
Are they working?

749
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:28,166
Yes, they are.

750
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:32,416
- Who's on it?
- Maai.

751
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:36,333
- Maai?
- Sorry, Maestra Sindhubai Jadhav.

752
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,583
How do you spell Sindhubai?

753
01:25:54,916 --> 01:26:00,125
S-I-N-D-H-U-B-A-I.

754
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:06,166
What did she sing?

755
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,291
Classical music.

756
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,208
Did she win any awards?

757
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:18,000
Yes, Sangeet Natak Akademi, 1973.

758
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:32,166
Her name is not on the list,
so the rate will be different.

759
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:35,791
I don't want any money,
I just want to donate them.

760
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:38,125
How many tapes are there?

761
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:39,458
Around eight.

762
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:44,791
But there is no singing on them.

763
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:45,875
What then?

764
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:50,166
It's her lectures
on music, delivered in 1972.

765
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:54,083
Leave a sample here.

766
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:57,250
I will have to ask if we can accept them.

767
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:00,250
Madam, this is invaluable material.

768
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,333
No one has ever had access to it.

769
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:03,541
I see.

770
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:05,916
Are you a collector?

771
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,958
No, someone gave these tapes to my father.

772
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:10,041
Okay.

773
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:13,666
I'll give you a form to fill in.

774
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:21,333
You'll have to
come in again to label them.

775
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,916
I've already labeled them perfectly.

776
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:26,000
All right then.

777
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:35,333
Madam, will they be sent to the library?

778
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,958
Yes. On approval,

779
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:40,125
they will be added to our
on-site library and digital archive.

780
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:47,833
How many copies do you have?

781
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,166
This is the only one.

782
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,291
Laxmitai, please take this away.

783
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:20,166
<i>Welcome back to </i>The Fame India <i>Season 2!</i>

784
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:26,666
<i>Our next finalist from the top 12
is Shaswati Bose from Jhargram.</i>

785
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:32,416
<i>She impressed the judges
and secured a ticket to Mumbai.</i>

786
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,791
<i>Let's look at her journey so far.</i>

787
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:40,458
<i>Music is my everything. It's my all.</i>

788
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:44,125
I sing when I'm sad and when I'm happy.

789
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:48,333
<i>I want to make a career
in music, and I want to excel.</i>

790
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:52,875
Ever since she was a child,
I've wanted her to learn to sing.

791
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:57,166
<i>I've always supported her,
and will keep on doing so.</i>

792
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,791
Fame <i>is a really big platform for me.</i>

793
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:03,958
<i>I've been showered
with so much love. I feel blessed.</i>

794
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:08,541
<i>I know this platform will help me
realize my parents' dreams.</i>

795
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:11,666
<i>I never imagined
that all of this would happen.</i>

796
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,166
Let's have a five-minute break.

797
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:30,000
Please come, Madam.

798
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:34,333
Karan, get a chair.

799
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,375
- How are you, sir?
- Good, you?

800
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:38,458
Fine.

801
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Sorry you had to wait.

802
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,250
No problem.

803
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:46,583
- Will you have some tea or coffee?
- No, thank you.

804
01:30:46,666 --> 01:30:47,833
So, tell me…

805
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:50,750
Did Karan tell you anything?

806
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:53,833
He just said
that you would be coming to see me.

807
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:57,416
Actually, sir,
he has an offer to join a band.

808
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,958
But he will only
take it up if you say it's okay.

809
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:03,041
So he wants your permission, sir.

810
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,250
What band is this?

811
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:05,458
What is it?

812
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,666
A college band, sir.

813
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,166
The seniors are forming a fusion band.

814
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,958
They've asked me
to do the classical vocals.

815
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:16,000
Okay. Is it for some album?

816
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:18,833
No, sir. It's for college festivals

817
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:21,958
like Malhar or Mood Indigo.

818
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:25,541
Later there's
the University Youth Festival.

819
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:27,291
I see.

820
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,791
I told him he must do it.

821
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:33,708
It will give him
stage experience and some exposure.

822
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:36,583
But he says he will only do it
if he has your go-ahead.

823
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,583
So is it mainly Western or classical too?

824
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:43,000
It's a mix, sir.

825
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:46,291
There's an English singer,
and I will do the classical part.

826
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:48,458
I see.

827
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:53,291
Let him go ahead, no problem.

828
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:57,250
But then
he doesn't need to come back here.

829
01:31:58,416 --> 01:31:59,416
Why, sir?

830
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:01,250
What will he do here?

831
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:02,791
He'll waste his time.

832
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,500
He sings well enough to be in a band.

833
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:10,541
He gets his notes right,
he's had some training. That's enough.

834
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:13,708
Sir, are you upset?

835
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:18,000
No, I'm being frank. He can do fusion,
but he shouldn't come back to classical.

836
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:21,875
He'd spoil
the school's name, and mine as well.

837
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:24,333
Why are you saying this?

838
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,916
Look, he is still
miles away from singing <i>Khayal.</i>

839
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:32,625
If he gets into all of this,
he'll never get there.

840
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:36,083
So why waste time and money?
That's all I'm saying.

841
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:39,250
Sir, you're misunderstanding the issue.

842
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:41,125
But you should also understand,

843
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:44,833
if you want him to
run before he can walk, go ahead.

844
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:46,166
Don't ask me.

845
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:53,416
Karan, have I upset you?

846
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:55,958
Sorry if I crossed the line, madam.

847
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:57,416
Why are you getting nervous?

848
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,791
Is his father feeding us? We've paid him.

849
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:03,458
He's not teaching you for free.

850
01:33:03,541 --> 01:33:04,916
Who is he to say no?

851
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,375
Let's complain about him to the principal.

852
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,916
I'll fix him.

853
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
You will join the band
and learn music too.

854
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:13,583
No need to get nervous. Understood?

855
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:15,000
Now don't cry like a baby.

856
01:33:58,708 --> 01:34:01,333
Hello, Ma? Can you hear me?

857
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,416
I can hear you.

858
01:34:05,666 --> 01:34:06,708
How are you?

859
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:10,583
I'm okay.

860
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:15,500
Sorry, I totally forgot.

861
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:21,125
Yes, tell Viju
that I will take care of it.

862
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:24,541
I will send it next month, don't worry.

863
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:28,333
Yes.

864
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:37,833
I was wondering if I should
come and stay there for a few days?

865
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:42,791
Yes.

866
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,250
I will try to come next month.

867
01:34:48,166 --> 01:34:49,166
Sure.

868
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:55,500
No, please. If you're going
to bring that up, I won't come.

869
01:34:57,375 --> 01:34:59,041
Just four more years.

870
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,541
As soon as I turn 40,

871
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:02,583
we can start looking for a wife for me.

872
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:05,875
Divorcees, widows, anyone will do.

873
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:08,458
For real.

874
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:12,083
What?

875
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,000
The line is breaking up.

876
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,250
Hello?

877
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,291
Okay, bye now.

878
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:44,416
Can I play one ball?

879
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:46,416
Raja.

880
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,583
Deliver a ball to him.

881
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:02,458
Lovely ball!

882
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:44,666
Today is
the 35th anniversary of Maai's death.

883
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:49,875
And if I don't sing well today,

884
01:36:51,583 --> 01:36:54,541
I fear she will suddenly appear before me…

885
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:59,666
and give me a good scolding

886
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:02,916
right in front of all of you.

887
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:09,083
I will try my best to sing.

888
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:12,166
Allow me some time…

889
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:15,541
for my throat to warm up.

890
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,583
And then let's hope my voice cooperates.

891
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:58,625
Yes, sir. We're sitting inside.

892
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:04,416
I'm so sorry I'm late.

893
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,000
Have you been waiting long?

894
01:39:06,083 --> 01:39:07,750
No problem at all.

895
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,958
- Hello, I'm Rajan Joshi.
- Sharad.

896
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,250
Please sit.

897
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:20,125
What's this? Where's his glass?

898
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:21,666
I don't drink.

899
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,125
Come on, have one. I just look old.

900
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:27,958
Please don't be shy.

901
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:30,208
Actually, he's a singer, so that's why.

902
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:32,666
- Nice! Classical?
- Yes.

903
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:35,250
One whiskey and a little water.

904
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,333
And for you?

905
01:39:37,416 --> 01:39:39,166
- Repeat?
- Repeat.

906
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:43,208
- And for you?
- Really, I'm fine.

907
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:46,166
Have something, maybe a soft drink?

908
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:49,875
Okay, fresh lime
with plain water. Not cold.

909
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:54,916
- You're a Mumbai guy?
- Yes.

910
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:58,666
He's a big fan of your work.

911
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:02,125
He's read all your reviews in <i>Sancharika.</i>

912
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,708
That's why all the musicians
in Mumbai hated my guts.

913
01:40:08,291 --> 01:40:10,333
Because I would bash them all.

914
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:14,000
I really love your writing.

915
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:15,083
Thank you.

916
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:19,791
Even from America, you have done so much
research on the history of our music.

917
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:21,000
It's really inspiring.

918
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:22,666
- Great.
- Thank you.

919
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:26,083
It's good to hear
that the younger generation

920
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,666
is still interested in these things.

921
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:32,208
It's easy now
because of the websites and the Internet.

922
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:34,416
It reaches everyone instantly.

923
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:38,833
To be honest, I have so much material

924
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:43,833
that I can easily keep writing
for the next ten years.

925
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,125
- Wow.
- And this is just my Park City stuff.

926
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,625
My Mumbai collection is another story.

927
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:55,541
Ask Kishore what they used to call me.

928
01:40:56,833 --> 01:41:00,083
- They used to call him "music thief."
- What?

929
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:05,458
He would get hold of the rarest
recordings and books from God knows where.

930
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:12,291
Faiyaz Khan, Imrat Hussain, Kesarbai.
You name it, he would have it.

931
01:41:12,375 --> 01:41:13,500
Wow.

932
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,250
Actually, that's why
I didn't invite you to my home.

933
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:24,791
So many people have stolen things
from my house, I have lost count.

934
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:26,666
Meaning?

935
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:32,958
If I went to the kitchen to get something,
people would simply nick things.

936
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:35,583
I'm talking about big, famous artistes.

937
01:41:35,666 --> 01:41:37,708
Jealous fuckers, all of them.

938
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:43,833
Now look at Kishore.
He's been chasing me for so many years.

939
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:46,166
But in an honest way.

940
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:48,458
I mean, he wants it for free.

941
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:51,166
People have offered me millions of rupees.

942
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:56,458
I told them, "Even if you
buy me three houses in Colaba,

943
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:59,125
there's some material
that I will never part with."

944
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:05,541
Anyway, tell me what you want.

945
01:42:05,625 --> 01:42:08,291
As I said on the phone,
I want recordings...

946
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:09,625
Of Shantidevi?

947
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:13,125
Yes, sir. Very few people have heard her.

948
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:15,000
I'd like to publish a CD.

949
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:18,583
Okay. Let me see what I have.

950
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:20,458
Thank you, sir. Thanks.

951
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:24,166
Recently, someone approached Sharma

952
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:27,416
from All India Radio
for Shantidevi's tapes.

953
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,375
And?

954
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:31,583
He said, "We don't keep music by whores."

955
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:33,833
What?

956
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:39,500
I mean, it's true that she was
a prostitute. Everybody knows it.

957
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:42,416
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

958
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:46,125
There are even photos of her in a bikini.

959
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:51,500
I'm talking about the '40s,
before she became famous.

960
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:54,250
She had posed for some magazine.

961
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,666
You're joking, right?

962
01:42:58,291 --> 01:42:59,708
No, I'm not.

963
01:42:59,791 --> 01:43:03,125
Later, some Gujarati businessman
kept her as his mistress.

964
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:06,875
He gave her money to learn music.

965
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:10,041
That's why
she added "Devi" to her name later.

966
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:12,541
To give herself an air of purity.

967
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,583
- You still want the recordings, right?
- Of course I want them, sir.

968
01:43:21,833 --> 01:43:24,875
- Do you have recordings of Maai?
- Maai?

969
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,833
Sindhubai.

970
01:43:28,291 --> 01:43:29,833
I might have some.

971
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:31,541
You do?

972
01:43:32,958 --> 01:43:35,041
But there are no recordings of her.

973
01:43:35,958 --> 01:43:38,333
That's because
she refused to perform in public.

974
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:42,333
- No, it wasn't like that...
- Forget it, let it be.

975
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:46,125
I won't say anything more,
you might be a devotee of hers.

976
01:43:46,208 --> 01:43:48,875
- No, he is an Alwar...
- Please, keep talking.

977
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,250
Let it go.

978
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:52,916
No, please continue.

979
01:43:55,958 --> 01:44:02,250
Look, I never believed this story
that she had no interest in performing.

980
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:06,500
That she was completely lost
in trance-like practice, and all that.

981
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:10,541
Is there any artist
who is not interested in performing?

982
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:15,375
- But she was different.
- Yes, a little too "different."

983
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,416
She was plain crazy.

984
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,500
- Let's just talk about...
- Hold on. What are you trying to say?

985
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:26,708
Let's drop it.

986
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:29,875
Please, I want to hear this.

987
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:37,125
I heard her sing in person,
sitting in her own house.

988
01:44:37,916 --> 01:44:39,000
You heard Maai?

989
01:44:39,541 --> 01:44:42,041
About 30 years ago, when I was your age.

990
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:43,666
But how?

991
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:45,875
Don't ask.

992
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:48,666
I've pulled off many such things in life.

993
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:50,958
She was an exceptional singer,

994
01:44:51,666 --> 01:44:54,583
but as a human being,
she was extremely offensive.

995
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:57,666
The horrible stuff she used to say…

996
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:01,625
"These Mughals came
and polluted our music."

997
01:45:01,708 --> 01:45:05,166
"I won't sing compositions
by Muslim people," and whatnot.

998
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:08,625
She even killed her own daughter's career.

999
01:45:09,916 --> 01:45:12,625
But she mentored
so many acclaimed musicians.

1000
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:15,375
Name one.

1001
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:17,666
Satish Raichand?

1002
01:45:18,416 --> 01:45:21,041
He was well-known before he went to Maai.

1003
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,750
He was trained by Khan Saheb.

1004
01:45:23,416 --> 01:45:24,541
Devendra Bhise?

1005
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:28,083
I don't like him at all. Hugely overrated.

1006
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:31,166
- Sharad, let it go.
- No, this is getting interesting.

1007
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,250
Maestro Vinayak Pradhan?

1008
01:45:36,083 --> 01:45:37,500
He's also Maai's student.

1009
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,500
- That guy from Dadar?
- Yes.

1010
01:45:44,708 --> 01:45:46,750
He's another fabricated story.

1011
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:50,458
"He's not interested
in concerts, he's a teacher,

1012
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:54,166
he's only committed to passing on
the Alwar legacy," and so on.

1013
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:57,958
The truth is that he couldn't
handle the pressure of the stage.

1014
01:45:58,041 --> 01:46:00,666
Mr. Joshi, please. That's his guru.

1015
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:06,125
I am sorry.

1016
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,291
I had no idea.

1017
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:15,208
- Let's wind it up now.
- Yes, please.

1018
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:23,250
But you know what, Kishore?

1019
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:27,875
These new kids must know
how to separate fact from fiction.

1020
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:32,208
The era is gone when people
could inflate someone into a demigod.

1021
01:46:32,291 --> 01:46:34,958
That's why so many people
got exploited in this field.

1022
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:38,291
Then carry on. Why are you holding back?

1023
01:46:40,125 --> 01:46:41,125
Look.

1024
01:46:42,625 --> 01:46:45,000
Fans love a good story.

1025
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:49,625
Maai's students painted her
as this mythical creature.

1026
01:46:51,583 --> 01:46:55,083
"Maai sang even with zero blood pressure."

1027
01:46:55,166 --> 01:46:57,916
What the fuck is zero blood pressure?

1028
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:03,208
"Maai knew
23 of Khan Saheb's secret <i>Raags."</i>

1029
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:06,250
Now who counted if there were 22 or 23?

1030
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:11,833
I recently heard that someone
secretly recorded some lectures of hers.

1031
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:14,166
I haven't heard them yet,

1032
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:16,166
but I'm pretty sure…

1033
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,208
it's the most pretentious, self-righteous,
elitist load of crock ever.

1034
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:03,916
Come sit.

1035
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,750
- Will you have tea?
- Yes.

1036
01:48:14,916 --> 01:48:17,750
Guruji, please don't accept
faraway concerts anymore.

1037
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:21,458
Yesterday's journey was so tiring for you.

1038
01:48:22,708 --> 01:48:24,166
What else can I do?

1039
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:26,916
I have to take whatever comes my way.

1040
01:48:28,166 --> 01:48:30,458
Do I get a monthly pension?

1041
01:48:31,125 --> 01:48:34,708
Or do you have
millions of rupees to keep giving me?

1042
01:48:35,416 --> 01:48:37,166
Are you short of anything?

1043
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:41,083
Why put yourself through this at your age?

1044
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,166
On top of it all,

1045
01:48:44,791 --> 01:48:48,166
these bloody organizers
don't even pay on time.

1046
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:51,666
Remember that
felicitation ceremony in Satara?

1047
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:54,625
They haven't given me the honorarium yet.

1048
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:58,416
They presented me
with this big, fake check.

1049
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,458
They never sent the real one.

1050
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:03,333
I'll talk to them.

1051
01:49:05,541 --> 01:49:08,000
Then the Gokhales did a house concert.

1052
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:10,458
They didn't even mention money.

1053
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:15,666
Just handed me
a cup of tea and some dry snacks.

1054
01:49:16,791 --> 01:49:21,083
Tell them to reimburse
our travel expenses at least.

1055
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:25,166
They didn't give you your taxi fare?

1056
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:53,166
Guruji?

1057
01:56:52,041 --> 01:56:53,250
Now catch that one.

1058
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:56,791
Now this one.

1059
01:56:59,083 --> 01:57:00,833
Now those tall buildings.

1060
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:34,708
Shall we start?

1061
01:57:34,791 --> 01:57:36,416
Yes. One moment, please.

1062
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:41,083
Sir, tell us about Anhad Sounds.

1063
01:57:42,833 --> 01:57:45,541
Anhad Sounds
is a new company we've launched.

1064
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:50,666
The company's mission is to promote
North Indian classical music.

1065
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:54,041
To ensure that it reaches a wide audience.

1066
01:57:55,083 --> 01:57:58,541
<i>Legacy of Alwar</i>
is our first offering to music lovers.

1067
01:57:59,333 --> 01:58:03,750
This collection
features 300 rare compositions

1068
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:07,041
belonging to the Alwar tradition.

1069
01:58:08,583 --> 01:58:12,250
We were worried
that Alwar's 200-year-old legacy

1070
01:58:12,333 --> 01:58:15,500
would get lost over time.

1071
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:19,958
So I felt that
it was important to document this.

1072
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:25,833
This project is the culmination
of nearly four years of research.

1073
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:31,666
Maestros Vilas Bhat,
Manoharbhau Mane, Archana Bhave

1074
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:35,125
and many other veterans
have contributed to this project.

1075
01:58:35,208 --> 01:58:38,500
Sir, how can listeners
access this collection?

1076
01:58:39,375 --> 01:58:43,375
The entire collection
is available on a USB stick.

1077
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:47,708
It can be bought
on the Anhad Sounds website.

1078
01:58:47,791 --> 01:58:51,041
What other plans does your company have?

1079
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:56,208
We will be releasing more collections,

1080
01:58:56,291 --> 01:58:58,500
which we are currently working on.

1081
01:58:58,583 --> 01:59:04,250
We also plan to publish books related
to music, offer online music classes…

1082
01:59:04,333 --> 01:59:08,041
We have lots of ideas.
Let's see how they shape up.

1083
01:59:08,125 --> 01:59:09,125
Okay.

1084
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:15,166
- Done?
- Yes. Thank you, sir.

1085
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:17,791
There's tea, coffee, and snacks,

1086
01:59:17,875 --> 01:59:19,125
please do help yourself.

1087
01:59:19,208 --> 01:59:20,708
Okay, thank you.

1088
02:00:03,666 --> 02:00:07,041
<i>Oh, seeker!</i>

1089
02:00:08,333 --> 02:00:12,791
<i>At the edge of a well, oh, seeker</i>

1090
02:00:14,583 --> 02:00:19,083
<i>I sowed a tamarind seed</i>

1091
02:00:20,333 --> 02:00:25,000
<i>At the edge of a well, oh seeker</i>

1092
02:00:26,416 --> 02:00:30,625
<i>I sowed a tamarind seed</i>

1093
02:00:31,958 --> 02:00:37,958
<i>The tree sprouts fish</i>

1094
02:00:38,041 --> 02:00:40,916
<i>And casts a fine shade</i>

1095
02:00:47,375 --> 02:00:52,500
<i>At the edge of a well</i>

1096
02:00:52,583 --> 02:00:54,666
<i>Oh, seeker</i>

1097
02:01:08,541 --> 02:01:13,541
<i>At the edge of a well, oh, seeker</i>

1098
02:01:16,916 --> 02:01:20,416
<i>A deer was wed</i>

1099
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:25,541
<i>At the edge of a well, oh, seeker</i>

1100
02:01:27,166 --> 02:01:30,750
<i>A deer was wed</i>

1101
02:01:33,583 --> 02:01:37,791
<i>She gave birth to five fawns</i>

1102
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:51,333
<i>At the edge of a well, oh, seeker</i>
