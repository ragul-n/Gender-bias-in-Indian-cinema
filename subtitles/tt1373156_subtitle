1
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,217
- Hello...
- Good morning, sir.

2
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,288
- Sir, USC Bank is offering you
a free credit card.

3
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:46,420
- I’m not interested, thank you.
- Sir, hello...

4
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,325
hello, sir... hello...

5
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,404
- Karthik!

6
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,974
Karthik... wait!

7
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,445
- Mr Karthik...

8
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,183
Where do you think you're going?

9
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,652
I’m deducting ten thousand rupees...

10
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,388
from your lease deposit
as elevator repair charges.

11
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:21,087
- From my deposit...
- Why not?

12
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,260
Don't you use the elevator?
Of course, you do!

13
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,463
l need more deposit.
Fifty thousand rupees!

14
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:28,727
- Or you can vacate the apartment.
- But...

15
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,303
I’ve let one of the garages...
number four on rent.

16
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:34,367
The rent is fifteen thousand rupees.

17
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,774
And the deposit is
one hundred thousand!

18
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,043
it’s okay if you can't afford it.

19
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,447
it’s alright, there are
many waiting for that flat.

20
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:47,112
So... Mr Karthik...

21
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,636
What's your mobile number?

22
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:08,701
l don't use a mobile.

23
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,838
l knew that!

24
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,407
Then why did you ask?

25
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:15,641
No reason!

26
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:17,878
About time you became cool.

27
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,445
Cool?

28
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,116
I’m not a fool!

29
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:22,448
l read on the internet that...

30
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,954
the radiation of the mobile battery
causes brain damage.

31
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,388
What??

32
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,092
Don't you know about
the egg and mobile experiment?

33
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:33,726
Egg and mobile?

34
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,595
No!

35
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:36,228
A mobile was kept ringing
near an egg for weeks.

36
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,805
After three weeks
chicks emerged from the other eggs.

37
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:43,868
But from the egg near the mobile...

38
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:47,038
only water!

39
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,308
I’m not bothered...

40
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,045
l don't own a poultry farm!

41
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:01,821
Boss said you'd do it.

42
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:03,555
But I’m doing this...

43
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,125
If you have a problem,
have a word with the boss.

44
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,225
Talk to him.

45
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:16,236
What do you actually do all day?

46
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:17,034
Sir...

47
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:19,738
You haven't cracked a single deal!

48
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:24,411
We're a construction company and
you haven't sold a single piece of land.

49
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:27,447
Sir, last year l bagged four deals.

50
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,514
You didn't bag those deals,
Vinay did!

51
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:30,614
No, sir...

52
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:30,681
Sir, those leads... meetings...

53
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:33,284
- Stop making excuses!

54
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,521
This is exactly what
I’m talking about, you idiot!

55
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,089
I’m sorry, sir.

56
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,358
I’ll try harder.

57
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:41,858
You know what, Karthik,
this is your final warning.

58
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:46,465
- You must bag
at least two deals this month.

59
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:46,696
Otherwise I’m sorry, but l...

60
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,766
don't think l will
want you in this company.

61
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,771
Sir, but l handle the paper work
of the entire office, sir...

62
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:53,803
- So what?

63
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,242
You don't want to move
a single muscle?

64
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,112
- You want to be paid
to sit on your behind?

65
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:04,080
No, sir.

66
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:06,383
Get out.

67
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:27,571
- Good morning, Shonali.
- Good morning.

68
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,949
Everyday l see your face...

69
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:20,657
and l know that even in hell
one can find an angel.

70
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,724
My angel.

71
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:29,657
Excuse me, what's the time?

72
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:45,706
- Karthik, you have to prepare
all the Raheja contracts tonight.

73
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,177
- We need to submit them
tomorrow morning.

74
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:53,781
But... but sir, there are 11 contracts.

75
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:57,018
- l know that,
but you have the whole night.

76
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,119
Just do it.

77
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:47,365
Hello...

78
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,403
- Karthik, where the hell are
the DLH Builders' contracts?

79
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:53,904
l don't know, sir.

80
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:54,939
- What do you mean,
you don't know??

81
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:59,145
- You had to prepare both
the Raheja and DLH Builders' contracts.

82
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,581
- Only the Raheja contracts
are present here.

83
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:02,212
No, sir,
you mentioned only Raheja.

84
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:05,082
- Don't lie to me, Karthik!

85
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:09,490
- l dearly told you,
Raheja and DLH Builders, both.

86
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:10,790
No, sir... really...

87
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:10,855
- l don't care how you do it, Karthik.

88
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,526
- l want those contracts ready
by one p.m. today!!

89
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,362
But sir, l just got home...

90
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:18,897
l haven't slept at all.

91
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,531
- l don't pay you to sleep.

92
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:22,368
- Come to office right now and do it!

93
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:23,903
- Don't even know why I’ve hired you.

94
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:24,634
- Idiot!

95
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,641
Karthik!

96
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:06,276
Yes, sir.

97
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,412
Hurry up!
Come to my car.

98
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,319
Yes, Mr Ratan...

99
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,152
Yes...

100
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,992
Of course!
The Thane land is yours!

101
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:24,930
Trust me, it isn't illegal!

102
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,631
We don't indulge in such deals.

103
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:31,603
Sir, the court has passed
a stay order on that land.

104
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:34,938
Okay... bye.

105
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:38,709
Keep your trap shut!!

106
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:43,178
Anyway, you know what
these contracts seem fine.

107
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:46,082
Driver, stop the car.

108
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,253
You can get off over here.

109
00:13:57,927 --> 00:13:57,927
- This is a good piece.

110
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:01,264
- It's Japanese, a new model.

111
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,700
it has many amazing features.

112
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,603
Alarm, calendar...

113
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:16,478
Sir?

114
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,615
Card or cash?

115
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:26,723
Birthday present in advance.

116
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,158
idiot!

117
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,846
- Mom and dad never believed
that he troubled me.

118
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,249
- He never did anything
in their presence.

119
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,820
- l had to suffer Kumar's taunts...

120
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,256
- his anger, everyday.

121
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,659
- That day he took me
some place.

122
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:07,663
- We got there and
he tried to push me into a well.

123
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:12,035
- l managed to free myself
and ran away, but...

124
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:15,336
- but Kumar fell into the well.

125
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:18,741
- Because of me.

126
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:20,942
- I’m responsible for his death.

127
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:21,976
- l took his life.

128
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:28,316
It wasn't your fault.

129
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,221
Did you push him intentionally?

130
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,387
No.

131
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:33,686
That incident has scared you...

132
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:38,794
from confronting people all your life.

133
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:39,526
You still believe that...

134
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:43,766
you're better off
tolerating everything silently.

135
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,267
But people take advantage of this.

136
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,401
Then what should l do?

137
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:51,273
Don't let anyone suppress you.

138
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,674
Build your self confidence.
Stand up for yourself.

139
00:15:58,343 --> 00:15:59,846
May l come in, sir?

140
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,689
Sir, l was upset.

141
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:08,353
About what?

142
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:13,930
That you thought,
l didn't prepare the DLH contracts, sir.

143
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Sir...

144
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:20,269
In fact you forgot to
tell me about them.

145
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,373
You mean to say it was my fault.

146
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,542
No, sir... that's not what l meant.

147
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:31,445
Sir, l... just wanted you to know that.

148
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:31,510
- That I’m an idiot!
- No, sir...

149
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:33,445
I’m an ass!

150
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:35,481
In fact...

151
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:36,882
you want me to
say sorry to you.

152
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:43,590
- Come... please...

153
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,160
- Listen up everyone.
Look here.

154
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:53,101
Our friend, Mr Karthik Narayan,
wants me to say sorry to him.

155
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:53,397
- Sir... l...

156
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:56,402
- Just because l gave you
some work to do...

157
00:16:57,102 --> 00:16:59,005
you think I’m being unreasonable.

158
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:01,741
He forgets to do it...

159
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:16,555
You're fired!
Do you understand that?

160
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:18,589
Who is this guy?

161
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,827
- Someone new?
- No.

162
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,930
- He's been here for four years.

163
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,330
- Karthik.

164
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:28,167
Strange... never noticed him.

165
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:56,894
- Mr Karthik...

166
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:57,527
How nice!
You want to use the lift...

167
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:02,902
but don't want to
pay for the maintenance!

168
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:05,135
Such a loser!

169
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,104
Hello...

170
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:29,993
- Mr Karthik...

171
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,430
Oh... Mr Karthik...

172
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,166
- are you inside?

173
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:36,900
- Mr Karthik...

174
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,102
- Oh... Mr Karthik...

175
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,418
Great!

176
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,657
What a way to celebrate a birthday!

177
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,259
Couldn't do anything great in this life.

178
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,628
Guess I’ll try again!

179
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,257
Hello...

180
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:13,763
Happy birthday to you...

181
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:18,235
happy birthday to you...

182
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:19,499
Happy Birthday, Karthik.

183
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,373
- Who is this?
- Don’t you recognise the voice?

184
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,542
This is Karthik.

185
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,545
I am Karthik.

186
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:32,913
And so are you.

187
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:33,680
What's the meaning of this?

188
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:37,084
What were you trying to do?

189
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,219
Take your own life?

190
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:40,387
Since you were out of insecticide...

191
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:44,626
you thought you would
overdose on sleeping pills.

192
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:45,725
But now...

193
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:49,563
you needn’t die.

194
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,500
Now that I'm here.

195
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,604
Everything is going to change, Karthik...
everything!

196
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:00,808
I'm going to improve your life.

197
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:02,910
Who is this?

198
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:04,910
If I'm not Karthik,
how do I know that...

199
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:08,683
your bank PIN number...

200
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,383
is 1-2-7-6?

201
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:11,384
Or that the scar below your eye...

202
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:13,552
was the result of...

203
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,224
being hit by a cricket ball
when you were eight.

204
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,190
When you're nervous...

205
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,829
you start scratching yourself.

206
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,196
Am I right?

207
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:24,163
Alright then, tell me...

208
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,834
What do you want to know?

209
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:27,499
The colour of your socks?

210
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,907
Yesterday you wore black socks.

211
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,075
and you're still wearing them.

212
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:37,742
and if you don’t change them...

213
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:39,078
your big toe
will tear it's way out...

214
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:43,750
to say, ''Hello!''

215
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,363
Nobody called you last night.

216
00:21:58,029 --> 00:21:58,730
What?

217
00:21:59,164 --> 00:21:59,164
Nobody called you...

218
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:02,602
last night.

219
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:06,607
Well then check today's call history.

220
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,775
Five at night...

221
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,410
would be today.

222
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,483
No calls today either.

223
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,953
The last call you received was...

224
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:21,019
four days ago.

225
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:23,922
That's it!

226
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:26,692
Could have been last week.

227
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:29,261
Perhaps you forgot.

228
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:31,062
- Sir...

229
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,066
please.

230
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:34,898
Your phone isn't ringing...
it's your...

231
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:37,402
ears that are ringing!

232
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:40,238
- Your ears!

233
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:30,354
Hello...

234
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:33,323
I knew it!

235
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,929
I knew you wouldn’t believe and...

236
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,996
go to the telephone exchange.

237
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:41,832
What did you find out?

238
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:44,301
That nobody called you?

239
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:51,511
Did you think that
last night was a dream?

240
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:54,278
Don’t you believe or...

241
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,480
don’t you want things to change?

242
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:59,450
Probably you choose
to live a miserable life.

243
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:02,920
Or you prefer living in dreams?

244
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:07,023
But you aren’t peaceful
even in your dreams.

245
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:09,393
You still dream about
your brother Kumar.

246
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:10,725
How do you know that?

247
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:11,893
And every week,
you waste a lot of money...

248
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:17,868
taking advice from a psychiatrist!

249
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:20,838
Has the therapy
over the years helped you?

250
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,372
Of course not?

251
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:27,378
Don’t you wish Shonali
were a part of your life?

252
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:31,281
Or are you content writing emails
and not sending them?

253
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,783
Is this how you wish to live?

254
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:37,688
Or don’t you believe that
someone is really trying to help?

255
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,024
Believe it or not.

256
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:43,926
I call you.

257
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,296
Do l threaten you?

258
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,563
Do I trouble you?

259
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,030
Am I hurting you?

260
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:50,598
No?

261
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:55,272
Then why can’t you believe
that I am your well wisher, Karthik?

262
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:57,574
Just wait for me to call.

263
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:01,812
And in time, you and I
will make everything alright.

264
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,781
All you need to do is trust me.

265
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:09,518
Believe what I say...

266
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,285
do what I say...

267
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,487
and everything will be good again.

268
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,758
Trust me.

269
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,027
Believe that things will change.

270
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:18,325
Don't you want to change your life?

271
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:22,564
Do you believe in me, Karthík?
Do you believe in me?

272
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:22,830
Do you?

273
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:25,500
Trust me, Karthík...
trust me!

274
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:26,666
Believe in me!

275
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,904
Don't you wish to improve your life?

276
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:29,036
Don't you want your life to change?

277
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,539
Trust me, Karthik.

278
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:31,738
l want my life to change.

279
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:32,940
Trust me, Karthik.

280
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,641
Believe me!

281
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:36,377
Trust me, Karthik.
Trust me!

282
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,649
And everything will be fine.

283
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,048
l believe you.

284
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,609
Your biggest drawback is...

285
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:11,813
that you're unable to
say 'no' to people.

286
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:13,813
You just can’t say 'no'.

287
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:14,714
It's okay to say 'no'.

288
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,421
If you don’t,
people will take you for a ride.

289
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:22,090
Learn to say 'no'.

290
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:24,124
No?

291
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:24,590
Say it loudly...

292
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:27,260
with confidence.

293
00:26:28,728 --> 00:26:28,728
- Karthik... Karthik... Karthik...

294
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:31,965
- Where's my deposit?

295
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,030
- You're paying, aren't you?

296
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:34,668
- Tell me, yes or no?

297
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:37,570
No!

298
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:39,071
- What?

299
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:40,941
You have to give me five thousand.

300
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:43,510
Why is that?

301
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,279
Thirty thousand to
repair the kitchen leakage.

302
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,851
Twenty five thousand to
repair the living room flooring.

303
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,549
I’ve spent a total of
fifty five thousand.

304
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:55,154
That's five thousand more
than the deposit.

305
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:58,023
So give it to me.

306
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:01,159
You seem upset...

307
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:03,964
and that too without any reason.

308
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:06,233
You don't need to be upset about it.

309
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:08,534
hold on...

310
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:08,833
And shut down the illegal office...

311
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,139
in garage number four.

312
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:14,874
What's it to you?

313
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,979
l don't like the cap
of the watchman out there.

314
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:19,844
Cap?

315
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,114
Shut it down or I’ll have it raided.

316
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:25,586
My aunt works at
the Property Tax Department.

317
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,987
I’ll call her over for lunch.

318
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:29,019
- She'll sniff it out.
- Okay.

319
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,155
No! No...

320
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:35,997
My phone... it's ringing...
for a while now...

321
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:46,504
Here's your five thousand.

322
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:47,738
Take it...

323
00:27:48,572 --> 00:27:49,607
please... l insist.

324
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:51,176
l was only kidding.

325
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,045
Let me help you...

326
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:10,321
You aren’t responsible
for your brother's death.

327
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:15,758
The fact is...

328
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:15,825
when you began to run away...

329
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:19,898
he tried to tie you with a rope.

330
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:24,036
He lost his balance and
he fell into the well.

331
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:25,334
You've been carrying
this guilt all your life...

332
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:30,206
even though you've done no wrong.

333
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,909
So l didn't kill him?

334
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,647
He was a bully.

335
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:40,617
He died due to his own fault.

336
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:44,555
Prepare yourself, Karthik...

337
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,524
to sort out the other bullies.

338
00:29:48,824 --> 00:29:48,824
Who stood first in college?

339
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:00,401
So who deserves the respect?

340
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:21,590
Be the man,
you've always wanted to be.

341
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:23,658
Be me!

342
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:24,558
Barge into Kamath's cabin and...

343
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,762
look at him and say...

344
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:29,464
Kamath!

345
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:31,331
- We need to talk.

346
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,168
What the hell
is the meaning of this?

347
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,306
Listen, if you're here
for your old job...

348
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:45,712
I’m worried.

349
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:47,747
Wondering if Mr Ratan finds out that...

350
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:52,121
the land you're selling him
is illegal.

351
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,822
You will be in a huge mess.

352
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:03,997
Anyway...

353
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:04,063
this week you have...

354
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,668
a meeting with Ambuja, don't you?

355
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:08,601
- Yes.

356
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:09,736
Are the contracts ready?

357
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:11,405
Yes.

358
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,473
May I?

359
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,611
What are you afraid of, Kamath?

360
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:18,979
Let me have a look.

361
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:26,886
Great!

362
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:27,152
If Ambuja  signs this contract...

363
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,958
you won't make
a profit of hundred million.

364
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,861
You will incur a loss of forty million.

365
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:34,793
What??

366
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,497
You mean there is a mistake?

367
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:42,769
There are twelve.

368
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,405
Sorry.

369
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,009
Aren't you getting late for the meeting?

370
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:50,743
What are the mistakes?

371
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,946
Why will I incur a loss?

372
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,816
The Rain Clause is absent.

373
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:57,215
If work is delayed due to the rain...

374
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,120
your company will have to
bear all the losses.

375
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,523
Service Tax has been
charged at 12.24%.

376
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,760
Last year the Service Tax
was increased to 12.36%.

377
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:06,825
Which means...

378
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,060
according to this costing,
your company...

379
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,633
will incur a loss of
four million eight hundred thousand.

380
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,670
I’m working with a bunch of idiots!

381
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,942
The fact is,
you never realised...

382
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,845
why the paper work
in the office is perfect.

383
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,616
It was me, Kamath.

384
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,718
Me!

385
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,423
How about a game?

386
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,526
Good afternoon.

387
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:42,159
If anyone can tell the boss...

388
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,500
the 1984 amendment of
the Builders Act, 15 A...

389
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,332
then he will give that person...

390
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:49,399
his very own Mercedes.

391
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,978
What's wrong?

392
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:01,980
None of them have a due.

393
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:09,756
Greta, does anyone know
the 1984 amendment of the Act?

394
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,190
- Sir, they're checking on the internet, sir.

395
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:14,491
Idiots!

396
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,128
By the way...

397
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:18,996
do you know what it is?

398
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:22,332
- It's basically... umm...

399
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:23,767
The amendment says that
the builder has to...

400
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,739
renew his licence every four years.

401
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:28,672
If the licence is not renewed...

402
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,243
then all his deals
will be considered illegal.

403
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,179
- He could also be imprisoned.

404
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:39,284
When did your father
start this company for you?

405
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,385
01/09/05

406
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:42,986
And...

407
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:44,255
today is?

408
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:45,890
31st August...

409
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,558
2009!

410
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:52,365
So you have just one day
to renew the licence.

411
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:54,231
Oh my God!

412
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:57,901
This could even take a week.

413
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:01,904
I’ll take your leave.

414
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:02,805
Okay.

415
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,309
- No, Karthik, l need you.

416
00:34:05,574 --> 00:34:06,609
You can...

417
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:07,743
have your...

418
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,913
your old position back.

419
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:12,381
Job?

420
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,886
You mean that crummy job?

421
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,390
Okay, what is it that you want?

422
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:21,559
Head of Business Development.

423
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:22,357
A four fold increase in my salary.

424
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:25,027
Two assistants.

425
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:28,064
And the new corner cabin.

426
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:29,866
The cabin?

427
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,934
- no?

428
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Let's play another game...

429
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:35,571
No... it's okay... okay.

430
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:37,106
Done.

431
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,246
Just tell me the procedure
to renew the licence.

432
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:43,512
I’m here now!

433
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,812
Relax...

434
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:45,847
chill.

435
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,122
Both mobiles belong to you?

436
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:53,188
Yes.

437
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,090
And you use them repeatedly?

438
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,023
Yes.

439
00:34:58,092 --> 00:34:59,060
Very good!

440
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,314
Feels good doesn’t it, Karthik?

441
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,415
Don’t you like it?

442
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:55,182
It's unbelievable
that till a few days ago...

443
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,825
you had no respect.
You were a slave.

444
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:06,359
And now...

445
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:09,898
Now everyone knows who you are.

446
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,734
- Yes...
- Shonali needs to notice you now.

447
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,439
Don’t you want her
in your life, Karthik?

448
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,241
Get ready...

449
00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:20,706
we have a new mission.

450
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:23,477
What about Ashish?

451
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:26,748
First of all,
go and talk to her boyfriend.

452
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:30,718
It's time he went back to his wife.

453
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:35,555
Wife?

454
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:42,195
- Hi, Ashish...
- Hi, Karthik...

455
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:43,329
Everything alright?

456
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:45,665
Wife?

457
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:46,699
Kids?

458
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:50,871
Congrats on the promotion,
by the way.

459
00:36:52,738 --> 00:36:54,440
Whatever, pal!

460
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,676
So tell me...

461
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:58,845
when are you telling Shonali
about your wife?

462
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:02,681
Um... wi... wife?

463
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:03,015
Yes.

464
00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:05,318
Wi... wife.

465
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,054
The one in Delhi.

466
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,491
And your six year old kid.

467
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,661
Ring a bell?

468
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,537
How did you find out?

469
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:28,407
It was on the entertainment channel.

470
00:37:29,174 --> 00:37:30,677
Saw it on the scroll.

471
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:33,713
Does it even matter?

472
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:36,983
The question is
who will tell Shonali?

473
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:38,549
You?

474
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,018
Or l?

475
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,756
l was to leave my wife...

476
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:46,792
l mean, I’m going to leave her.

477
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:49,594
Then tell Shonali that!

478
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,864
Karthik, what's it to you?

479
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,836
I like the sound of a slap.

480
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:01,305
Sound?

481
00:38:02,873 --> 00:38:04,008
How could you?

482
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,044
You lied to me?

483
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:07,912
If l hadn't...

484
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:09,481
you wouldn't go out with me.

485
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,115
What??

486
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:13,952
Are you stupid?

487
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:16,120
That's your excuse?

488
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,925
Shonali, just listen to me...

489
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:22,527
That's for lying!

490
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:26,330
That's for having a stupid excuse.

491
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:30,834
That was on behalf of your wife.

492
00:38:44,214 --> 00:38:46,183
Someone asked me...

493
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:46,816
why men chase women...

494
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:51,356
they don't intend to marry?

495
00:38:52,555 --> 00:38:53,924
l replied...

496
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:53,990
if dogs chase cars...

497
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:58,630
doesn't mean they want to drive!

498
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,069
l always knew that men are like dogs.

499
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:06,302
That's very unfair.

500
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,705
Dogs are loyal.

501
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:12,877
Do you need a lift?

502
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:14,978
Can l drop you somewhere?

503
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:17,814
Can you drop
this conversation instead?

504
00:39:21,683 --> 00:39:23,653
Granted that you
think men are like dogs.

505
00:39:25,388 --> 00:39:27,358
Then as a dog would...

506
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:29,526
may l follow you?

507
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,295
No, I’m fine.

508
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:34,663
I’ve been alone.

509
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,469
it’s... it's very overrated.

510
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:43,005
And no fun at all.

511
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,476
Let's do this...

512
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:48,377
you can vent your anger on me.

513
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:48,810
There are two benefits to this.

514
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:50,178
The first...

515
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:53,216
you'll feel better and...

516
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:53,348
secondly...

517
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:56,486
we'll get to know each other.

518
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:57,385
Karthik, that's really sweet of you...

519
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:00,924
but right now it's better...

520
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:03,126
that l stay away from you men
as much as possible.

521
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,462
Don't get me wrong,
but I’m not interested.

522
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:08,830
- But... If...
- Karthik!

523
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:11,367
l don't want to hear a thing.

524
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:17,240
You remember the story of
King Bruce and the spider?

525
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:21,279
The spider never lost hope despite
Repeatedly falling off a wall.

526
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:22,109
But...

527
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:24,146
Didn’t Shonali say that...

528
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:26,348
she doesn’t want to hear a thing?

529
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:28,082
Don’t worry.

530
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:01,416
You said you don't want to
Hear a thing.

531
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:02,583
Yeah...

532
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:03,617
But...

533
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,887
chat involves reading, right?

534
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:08,188
Well then, no chatting also!

535
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,370
Hey ya...

536
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:27,474
Hey ya...

537
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:30,343
Hey ya...

538
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:34,082
l see you walking through the door...

539
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:34,514
Hey ya...

540
00:41:35,248 --> 00:41:38,087
Why won’t you look across the floor...

541
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:38,684
Hey ya...

542
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:42,491
I got to tell you how I feel...

543
00:41:42,854 --> 00:41:42,854
Hey ya...

544
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:46,328
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...

545
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:47,760
Hey ya...

546
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:52,198
Hey ya...

547
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:56,202
Hey ya...

548
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:00,205
Hey ya...

549
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:04,409
Hey ya...

550
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:07,281
I wanna get closer to you...

551
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:08,579
Hey ya...

552
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:11,687
I need to be closer to you...

553
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,751
Hey ya...

554
00:42:12,818 --> 00:42:15,556
I got to tell you how I feel...

555
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:16,922
Hey ya...

556
00:42:16,988 --> 00:42:19,559
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...

557
00:42:19,824 --> 00:42:19,824
What can I say about how I feel...

558
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:27,301
Now that you're with me...

559
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,100
I have all I need, life is brighter...

560
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:35,810
Now that you're with me...

561
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,682
Where are we going?

562
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:44,348
To have coffee.

563
00:42:46,016 --> 00:42:47,986
Of course, but where?

564
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:50,356
Khandala.

565
00:42:50,522 --> 00:42:52,258
The hill station??

566
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:52,323
Yes.

567
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:53,391
You agreed to have coffee...

568
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:57,296
you didn't specify the place.

569
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,558
- Didn't we come here for...

570
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:29,025
coffee!

571
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:36,768
Just wait...

572
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:53,183
Coffee.

573
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:56,953
Coffee!

574
00:44:04,527 --> 00:44:06,497
All of this is specially for today?

575
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:07,897
This?

576
00:44:08,264 --> 00:44:10,200
No, I’ve had it in my pocket
For three years now!

577
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:13,604
Just joking!

578
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:16,006
All of this is especially for you.

579
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:17,407
One time offer only!

580
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:22,646
l know everybody says...

581
00:44:22,712 --> 00:44:24,682
that l should
practice as an independent architect.

582
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,652
But even out here, l get to
design a couple of buildings, don't l?

583
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,150
l agree the people at work are boring...

584
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:30,887
and we have a grumpy boss.

585
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,990
But other aspects of a job
are also important.

586
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:35,424
For example, security...

587
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:36,693
stability...

588
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:39,295
just like in relationships.

589
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:40,998
True!

590
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,333
But these days,
nice guys are hard to come by.

591
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:56,382
Someone who is
sweet, simple, honest...

592
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:06,354
By the way...

593
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:08,691
have you come across such a guy?

594
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,190
No...

595
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:11,460
l haven't come across a guy like that.

596
00:45:11,827 --> 00:45:12,962
I’m straight!

597
00:45:13,695 --> 00:45:14,696
Yeah...

598
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:15,329
You know...
you know what l mean!

599
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:19,735
l mean like a gentleman.

600
00:45:21,035 --> 00:45:21,035
By the way...

601
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:23,571
I’m no animal.

602
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:25,206
I’m quite gentle.

603
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,543
Yeah, Of course,
you aren't an animal!

604
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:30,313
You aren't loud or lazy.

605
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:33,915
You mean to say I’m boring?

606
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:35,983
No, no, no... no...

607
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,385
l mean...

608
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:37,652
you're a nice guy,
you're a...

609
00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:40,354
safe guy.

610
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:41,456
Safe?

611
00:45:41,556 --> 00:45:42,457
Yes!

612
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:44,493
And that's a good thing.

613
00:45:45,158 --> 00:45:45,158
You're concerned...

614
00:45:46,192 --> 00:45:46,192
polite...

615
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:48,730
you aren't cheap nor vulgar.

616
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:48,929
l mean, l can't even imagine...

617
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,067
that you'd misbehave with a girl.

618
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,203
Can't even imagine!

619
00:45:57,304 --> 00:45:58,305
Safe!

620
00:45:58,905 --> 00:45:58,905
If you'd like...

621
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:01,943
l could teach you to misbehave.

622
00:46:05,745 --> 00:46:07,081
Really!

623
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:17,858
I hope you're happy, Karthik.

624
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:19,826
Very soon...

625
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,563
Shonalí will be yours.

626
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:24,297
Forever!

627
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:30,269
Hey ya...

628
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:32,908
I wanna get closer to you...

629
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:33,807
Hey ya...

630
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,279
I need to be closer to you...

631
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:38,612
Hey ya...

632
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:41,750
I got to tell you how I feel...

633
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:42,147
Hey ya...

634
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:45,586
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...

635
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:50,127
What can I say about how I feel...

636
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:52,994
Now that you're with me...

637
00:46:54,093 --> 00:46:58,434
I have all I need, life is brighter...

638
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:01,336
Now that you're with me...

639
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:07,772
Hey ya...

640
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,010
Hey ya...

641
00:47:15,881 --> 00:47:19,922
A new colour adorns...

642
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:22,856
Every path as we stride...

643
00:47:24,222 --> 00:47:24,222
Your eyes twinkle and smile...

644
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:31,198
As you call me with arms open wide...

645
00:47:31,697 --> 00:47:36,105
As my dreams slowly bloom...

646
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:36,167
My heart sings a new tune...

647
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:44,280
I have all I need, life is brighter...

648
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:47,181
Now that you're with me...

649
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:57,788
Hey ya...

650
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:01,959
Hey ya...

651
00:48:05,897 --> 00:48:10,071
Your radiance doesn’t fade away...

652
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:13,172
I don’t ever need to be blue...

653
00:48:14,137 --> 00:48:14,137
The more I know you each day...

654
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,180
I see a bright new side of you...

655
00:48:21,746 --> 00:48:26,254
Life still feels so unreal...

656
00:48:26,316 --> 00:48:26,316
Yet I like the way I feel...

657
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:29,987
I have all I need, life is brighter...

658
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:37,563
Now that you're with me...

659
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:47,203
Hey ya...

660
00:48:47,904 --> 00:48:50,576
I wanna get closer to you...

661
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,340
Hey ya...

662
00:48:52,074 --> 00:48:54,913
I need to be closer to you...

663
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:55,512
Hey ya...

664
00:48:56,245 --> 00:48:59,317
I got to tell you how I feel...

665
00:48:59,683 --> 00:49:00,417
Hey ya...

666
00:49:00,483 --> 00:49:03,222
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...

667
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:09,325
Oh baby...

668
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,727
Hey ya...

669
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:13,496
Oh baby...

670
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,931
Hey ya...

671
00:49:16,332 --> 00:49:17,968
The only one for me...

672
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,101
Hey ya...

673
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:28,244
Cheeku??

674
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,514
- Neelu!
- Cheeku! Oh my God!

675
00:49:31,212 --> 00:49:31,212
How many years has it been?

676
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:33,583
You're all grown up now.

677
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:35,486
Well, l had no other option, did l?

678
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:35,885
I’m Neelu,
his cousin from Hyderabad.

679
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:39,122
- And you are?
- Shonali...

680
00:49:39,187 --> 00:49:40,423
Did you elope and get married?

681
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:41,222
No... no...

682
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:44,594
Just friends?

683
00:49:45,126 --> 00:49:45,126
You can't charm her, can you?

684
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:46,461
No...

685
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:51,702
No... umm... yes...

686
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,435
l mean, what are you saying?!

687
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:54,402
l knew it!

688
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:55,637
You can't do it!

689
00:49:55,703 --> 00:49:57,841
Especially not her!
She's so gorgeous!

690
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,877
You consider him
like your brother, don't you?

691
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,082
His girlfriend...
I’m his girlfriend!

692
00:50:05,747 --> 00:50:07,317
But you're the complete package!

693
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:09,485
Jackpot, Cheeku!

694
00:50:09,918 --> 00:50:09,918
We've moved here.

695
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:13,088
Sid has started a new business.

696
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:15,391
- Siddharth is in Mumbai ?
- Yes.

697
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:17,761
By the way,
Siddharth is her husband and...

698
00:50:17,826 --> 00:50:18,794
my college friend.

699
00:50:21,996 --> 00:50:23,733
So tell me...

700
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:23,798
have you told aunt?

701
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:27,402
Mom?

702
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:27,468
About what?

703
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:30,872
About her!

704
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:32,140
Well...

705
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,479
So when are you eloping to marry?

706
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:42,150
Siddharth...

707
00:50:43,017 --> 00:50:44,352
I’ll be back...

708
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:46,187
- Hi...

709
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:47,488
- How're you doing?
- Doing great.

710
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:48,355
- How are you?

711
00:50:48,488 --> 00:50:48,488
Let me guess...

712
00:50:49,556 --> 00:50:50,824
you eloped and married, didn't you?

713
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:52,360
How do you know?

714
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:53,694
Just!

715
00:50:53,827 --> 00:50:53,827
Don't you think...

716
00:50:54,895 --> 00:50:54,895
he should've
at least told his mother...

717
00:50:57,064 --> 00:50:58,767
that he has a hot girlfriend!

718
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:01,670
- Why hide it now
since he is her only son?

719
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:04,441
We were always
concerned about him.

720
00:51:04,504 --> 00:51:07,676
Because he was shy,
very reserved, always alone...

721
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,746
But now we can relax,
because you're there.

722
00:51:13,246 --> 00:51:15,651
Thanks for putting up with Neelu.

723
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:18,855
Actually, l enjoyed it, Cheeku!

724
00:51:20,988 --> 00:51:24,829
And thanks for saying that
you're my girlfriend.

725
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:25,491
l mean, sorry...

726
00:51:26,894 --> 00:51:28,696
that you had to lie about it.

727
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:29,830
Oh...

728
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:32,833
you're so sure l was lying?

729
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:34,400
Cheeku!

730
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:40,241
You mean...

731
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:41,941
it was the truth?

732
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:42,642
Maybe yes...

733
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:45,179
maybe no.

734
00:51:45,878 --> 00:51:46,846
Cheeku!

735
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:55,521
Thanks a lot.

736
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:57,223
Really... thanks.

737
00:51:59,558 --> 00:52:01,728
I know everything is perfect!

738
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:06,034
But Karthik, I want you
to promise me one thing.

739
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,069
Never tell anyone...

740
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:10,470
that I call you.

741
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:14,175
If you do,
people will think you're crazy and...

742
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:16,709
and I don’t want that!

743
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:19,880
Just promise me,
you will never tell anyone.

744
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,551
l promise.

745
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:30,189
Thanks for coming.

746
00:52:30,956 --> 00:52:32,326
Thanks for calling.

747
00:52:33,058 --> 00:52:34,628
Well then, thanks for taking my calls.

748
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,963
You don't need to thank me.

749
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:38,930
I’m not charged for in coming calls.

750
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,868
Come on, let's dance.

751
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:45,737
l don't dance.

752
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:47,138
Why?

753
00:52:47,404 --> 00:52:48,974
I’ve never danced.

754
00:52:50,642 --> 00:52:50,642
Not even if a...

755
00:52:52,143 --> 00:52:53,946
gorgeous girl requests?

756
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:56,680
Well... that's if a gorgeous girl...

757
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:59,852
actually requests.

758
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,855
You are so mean.

759
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:06,092
- Okay, get me a drink.
- Sure.

760
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:06,556
Pepsi, orange juice, apple juice...

761
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:11,896
Juice??

762
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:13,764
Juice!

763
00:53:15,532 --> 00:53:18,571
Juice is fine but dilute it...

764
00:53:18,635 --> 00:53:20,205
with vodka!

765
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,809
Oh God! Let me guess.
You don't drink!

766
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:26,210
If l do get drunk...

767
00:53:28,212 --> 00:53:30,115
will you take advantage of me?

768
00:53:31,315 --> 00:53:32,518
No...

769
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:35,587
Then what's the point!?

770
00:53:38,188 --> 00:53:41,728
The Dervish dances...

771
00:53:45,528 --> 00:53:49,068
Mesmerised by the music...

772
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:56,375
The Dervish dances...

773
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:03,616
Mesmerised by the music...

774
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:10,923
Sway to the beat, let's dance...

775
00:54:10,987 --> 00:54:10,987
Hum the tune, come on dance...

776
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,263
flow with the rhythm, slide in it's trance...

777
00:54:18,327 --> 00:54:21,634
Drink in the harmony, let loose and dance...

778
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:25,304
Your grace, I like the way you move...

779
00:54:25,368 --> 00:54:28,908
Your style, I like to see you groove...

780
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:34,548
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...

781
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:39,685
Your grace, I like the way you move...

782
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:43,355
Your style, I like to see you groove...

783
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:48,895
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...

784
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:03,342
A gorgeous vision, so unreal you are...

785
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:10,649
An illusion, so near yet so very far...

786
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:15,886
All around, your radiance and shine...

787
00:55:16,484 --> 00:55:21,460
You are one of a kind, ethereal and divine...

788
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:27,964
Let's fulfil our dream and dance...

789
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:31,602
feel my heartbeat, move closer and dance...

790
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:35,206
Cherish my love as we dance...

791
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:38,875
Drown yourself in me, let's dance...

792
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:42,480
Your grace, I like the way you move...

793
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:46,082
Your style, I like to see you groove...

794
00:55:46,213 --> 00:55:51,624
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...

795
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,994
Your grace, I like the way you move...

796
00:55:57,158 --> 00:56:00,564
Your style, I like to see you groove...

797
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:05,802
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...

798
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,439
What's that?

799
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,944
Holy water!

800
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:22,383
Whisky?

801
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:25,354
But weren't you
having wine at the pub?

802
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:28,456
Wine?

803
00:56:29,656 --> 00:56:31,158
Wine is for girls, darling.

804
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,562
Is that so...

805
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:37,999
I’ll take that.

806
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:40,101
No, that's enough,
you've had too much.

807
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:40,166
- Please.
- No.

808
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:42,436
- Just give.
- No... no.

809
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:44,072
Listen... no.

810
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:48,574
Why?

811
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:50,243
You want some too?

812
00:56:56,216 --> 00:56:58,219
you've had a lot already.

813
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:02,754
Fine!

814
00:57:11,997 --> 00:57:12,832
Good night.

815
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:22,441
Kiss me!

816
00:57:23,408 --> 00:57:24,143
What?

817
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:26,245
Kiss me.

818
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:30,916
No...

819
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:30,983
not now.

820
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:32,918
Why not?

821
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,154
Scared are you?

822
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:37,456
l know you like me!

823
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,259
l do...

824
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,795
but in this state...

825
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,131
you better sleep.

826
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,471
Don't misunderstand me.

827
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:52,837
l want to.

828
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,575
And you know l really like you.

829
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:57,642
I’ll keep thinking...

830
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,646
I’m taking advantage,
since you're drunk.

831
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:02,614
Advantage?

832
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,216
You are very high.

833
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:07,219
And you should sleep.

834
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:09,020
Fine!

835
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:13,691
Good night.

836
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,530
- Safe boy!!

837
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:00,604
Now what?

838
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,742
Now even I’m drunk.

839
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:05,208
Now it's okay...

840
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,680
we can take advantage
of each other.

841
00:59:59,294 --> 01:00:00,462
What happened?

842
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:03,499
Capturing this moment.

843
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:06,534
Why?

844
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:08,537
So I’ll remember it forever.

845
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:12,841
What do you mean remember it?

846
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,280
You aren't going away, are you?

847
01:00:19,113 --> 01:00:20,749
Why do you say that?

848
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:23,018
You're not just
having fun with me, are you?

849
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:27,357
l mean, this isn't just like
a one night thing, right?

850
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:29,792
What?

851
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:36,398
Is that what you think?

852
01:00:37,064 --> 01:00:39,034
You think this is
just physical for me?

853
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:42,438
I’ve met a lot of men who...

854
01:00:42,637 --> 01:00:42,637
appear to be nice
in the beginning...

855
01:00:44,071 --> 01:00:45,807
and then just disappear.

856
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,076
Or they're bloody married!

857
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:54,216
Come with me.

858
01:00:55,015 --> 01:00:56,551
- But where?
- Come on.

859
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,150
13th October 2007.

860
01:01:30,317 --> 01:01:32,554
- Today, for Diwali...
- For Diwali...

861
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:36,125
you distributed sweets to everyone.

862
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:39,361
You shook hands with everyone.

863
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:43,331
This is my happiest Diwali...

864
01:01:44,498 --> 01:01:46,368
because today you saw me...

865
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:48,769
and l got to touch your hand.

866
01:01:56,075 --> 01:01:58,112
You haven't come to office for four days.

867
01:01:58,612 --> 01:02:00,314
21st August 2008.

868
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:05,020
Just heard that you've
gone to Goa for a week.

869
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:08,589
You will be back after three days.

870
01:02:12,057 --> 01:02:14,127
Each day without you
is like a lifetime.

871
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:24,704
Why didn't you send these?

872
01:03:38,508 --> 01:03:42,917
How we met each other...

873
01:03:43,848 --> 01:03:46,819
and now we keep getting closer...

874
01:03:57,661 --> 01:04:02,404
Every moment now, is new to know...

875
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:15,047
Why does it seem...

876
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:18,618
The heart is humming a melody...

877
01:04:22,184 --> 01:04:22,184
Why does it seem...

878
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:28,661
Every moment is smiling with glee...

879
01:04:41,303 --> 01:04:41,303
When I saw you...

880
01:04:43,606 --> 01:04:48,782
for the very first time...

881
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:50,780
All I wished was...

882
01:04:53,048 --> 01:04:58,559
for you to be mine...

883
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:04,097
Once it was a dream...

884
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:06,396
just you and I...

885
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:06,461
and you softly whisper...

886
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:14,107
I am yours, now and forever more...

887
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,947
Why does it seem...

888
01:05:24,013 --> 01:05:27,819
The heart is humming a melody...

889
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:31,119
Why does it seem...

890
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:37,695
Every moment is smiling with glee...

891
01:05:54,008 --> 01:05:58,817
Every moment now, is new to know...

892
01:06:18,966 --> 01:06:18,966
Karthik...

893
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:20,935
Karthik sir!

894
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:22,403
Karthik sir...

895
01:06:22,736 --> 01:06:23,938
- Listen, l...
- Hold it!

896
01:06:24,638 --> 01:06:25,639
Shut the door.

897
01:06:31,044 --> 01:06:32,179
As l was saying...

898
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,249
Shut it from outside.

899
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:47,360
Jackass!

900
01:06:52,498 --> 01:06:53,867
Karthik...

901
01:06:55,701 --> 01:06:57,638
how many girlfriends have you had?

902
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,143
So how many girlfriends?

903
01:07:03,609 --> 01:07:04,811
Girlfriends?

904
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:08,515
Including you?

905
01:07:19,357 --> 01:07:20,526
One.

906
01:07:22,962 --> 01:07:25,266
And that's
never going to change either.

907
01:07:30,302 --> 01:07:32,539
Karthik, you know I’ve had boyfriends...

908
01:07:32,972 --> 01:07:34,975
but I’ve always burnt my fingers.

909
01:07:35,607 --> 01:07:35,607
I’ve been through it so many times...

910
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:39,479
that I’m always scared.

911
01:07:45,617 --> 01:07:47,587
What are you scared about?

912
01:07:50,722 --> 01:07:52,692
You know Ashish?

913
01:07:53,558 --> 01:07:55,227
He was married!

914
01:07:55,894 --> 01:07:56,695
Really??

915
01:07:58,063 --> 01:08:00,435
The bastard had
a wife and a child in Delhi.

916
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,769
He lied to me.

917
01:08:04,636 --> 01:08:06,105
Promise me, Karthik...

918
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,373
that you'll never keep secrets
from me.

919
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:12,077
If you ever lie to me...

920
01:08:13,845 --> 01:08:15,815
it will hurt too much.

921
01:08:16,781 --> 01:08:18,784
l love you a lot.

922
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,453
And l don't want to lose you.

923
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,789
Trust me, Shona.

924
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:26,591
I’m not like those other guys.

925
01:08:31,495 --> 01:08:33,465
I’m just a guy who loves you.

926
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:36,868
A lot!

927
01:08:37,334 --> 01:08:39,304
I’ll never keep any secrets.

928
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:50,381
No matter what...

929
01:08:50,447 --> 01:08:52,851
just tell me the truth.

930
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:54,785
Promise me.

931
01:08:58,022 --> 01:08:58,022
Never tell anyone...

932
01:08:59,555 --> 01:09:01,225
that I call you.

933
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:07,666
Actually... you see...

934
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:10,667
there's something...

935
01:09:12,669 --> 01:09:14,639
that is unusual.

936
01:09:15,505 --> 01:09:15,505
Well, not unusual...

937
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,276
it's special.

938
01:09:18,341 --> 01:09:19,309
What is it?

939
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:20,877
You see...

940
01:09:20,944 --> 01:09:21,912
the thing is...

941
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:25,149
It's our little secret, Karthik.

942
01:09:27,317 --> 01:09:28,217
What?

943
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:36,393
Shona, l...

944
01:09:43,298 --> 01:09:44,634
The phone, Karthik...

945
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:48,005
Yeah... just ignore it.

946
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,143
- I’ll answer it.
- No!

947
01:09:56,378 --> 01:09:58,448
l... I’ll get it.

948
01:10:49,164 --> 01:10:49,898
Hello...

949
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:15,234
Hello...

950
01:11:16,636 --> 01:11:16,636
- Good evening, sir.
I’m calling from USC bank, sir.

951
01:11:18,705 --> 01:11:18,705
- Sir, our bank has introduced
a new credit card offer.

952
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:24,380
- If you apply for one card,
you will also get a complimentary card.

953
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:30,549
Who was it?

954
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:32,052
Nobody.

955
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:36,822
It was a wrong number.

956
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:40,960
Are you okay?

957
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,431
Yeah.

958
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:55,108
You were saying something.

959
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:02,248
Something 'unusual'?

960
01:12:03,682 --> 01:12:03,682
Umm... well l...

961
01:12:05,384 --> 01:12:06,920
was saying that...

962
01:12:10,521 --> 01:12:12,658
For a girl like you...

963
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:13,359
to be with a...

964
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:16,429
boy like me...

965
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:19,398
it's...

966
01:12:20,099 --> 01:12:21,401
it's very unusual.

967
01:12:53,164 --> 01:12:56,103
Shona, everyday l get this call.

968
01:12:56,901 --> 01:12:58,270
It helps me.

969
01:12:58,802 --> 01:12:59,803
What do you mean?

970
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,544
l talk to him for hours.

971
01:13:05,709 --> 01:13:07,079
With whom?

972
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,456
Talk to whom?

973
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:24,261
Who calls you, Karthik?

974
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:30,267
Karthik.

975
01:13:32,568 --> 01:13:34,940
l call myself.

976
01:13:36,873 --> 01:13:38,843
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, l?

977
01:13:40,043 --> 01:13:42,447
The person who calls is Karthik.

978
01:13:44,414 --> 01:13:45,783
l mean...

979
01:13:46,749 --> 01:13:48,152
it is l.

980
01:13:54,358 --> 01:13:56,528
Stop joking, silly!

981
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:07,871
- Are you serious??

982
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:13,777
Karthik, are you serious??

983
01:14:16,312 --> 01:14:18,382
l really do get these calls.

984
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:21,485
But I’m not troubled by them.

985
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:21,851
They've helped me.

986
01:14:23,853 --> 01:14:23,853
They've transformed my life.

987
01:14:25,521 --> 01:14:27,057
Do you know what you're saying??

988
01:14:27,923 --> 01:14:29,492
How is it possible?

989
01:14:29,558 --> 01:14:32,130
l don't know but it does happen.

990
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:34,966
Karthik, someone is playing
a prank on you.

991
01:14:36,132 --> 01:14:36,132
How can helping me benefit others?

992
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,168
Correct!

993
01:14:39,402 --> 01:14:41,372
Even l get calls from myself.

994
01:14:42,204 --> 01:14:44,908
- You too?!
- No! Because it's not possible.

995
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:47,810
It is possible!

996
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:50,481
And in my life
it happens to be normal.

997
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:57,619
Shona...

998
01:15:03,858 --> 01:15:05,828
l think you need help.

999
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:08,331
Please, let's go to a doctor.

1000
01:15:08,696 --> 01:15:10,565
Shona, you're overreacting.

1001
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,601
There is no problem.

1002
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:14,603
Don't you worry.

1003
01:15:15,236 --> 01:15:17,640
After we're married,
I’ll keep the phone here...

1004
01:15:17,704 --> 01:15:18,907
in the living room
and talk softly.

1005
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,610
It won't even disturb your sleep.

1006
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:25,716
You really think, with your condition,
we should marry?

1007
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,290
Shona, don't do this.

1008
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,593
We're being honest.

1009
01:15:38,692 --> 01:15:40,729
And now you're saying,
you don't love me!

1010
01:15:41,028 --> 01:15:43,533
Of course, l love you
that's why I’m saying this.

1011
01:15:44,298 --> 01:15:46,435
For your well being,
our well being.

1012
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:54,675
I’m sorry, Shona, l...

1013
01:15:56,676 --> 01:15:58,646
won't see a psychiatrist.

1014
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:03,954
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1015
01:16:05,052 --> 01:16:06,220
No, Shona...

1016
01:16:11,091 --> 01:16:12,960
Karthik, then you decide.

1017
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,898
Either you see a psychiatrist or else...

1018
01:16:18,131 --> 01:16:20,669
l really don't have the energy for
one more bad relationship.

1019
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:34,448
Alright, I’ll go.

1020
01:16:35,348 --> 01:16:37,018
I told you not to?

1021
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,420
And yet you told her.

1022
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,924
How did it help?

1023
01:16:43,422 --> 01:16:45,759
Now Shonali thinks you're nuts,
doesn't she?

1024
01:16:47,927 --> 01:16:49,897
Now listen...

1025
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:52,800
nothing is lost yet.

1026
01:16:53,899 --> 01:16:56,237
Don’t listen to her.

1027
01:16:56,502 --> 01:16:58,873
Don’t go to the psychiatrist.

1028
01:16:59,172 --> 01:17:01,242
What are you afraid of?

1029
01:17:01,307 --> 01:17:01,307
That Shonali will leave you?

1030
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:05,778
If she truly loves you...

1031
01:17:05,844 --> 01:17:07,914
she will understand.

1032
01:17:09,582 --> 01:17:11,786
Who changed your life?

1033
01:17:12,217 --> 01:17:12,217
I did.

1034
01:17:13,586 --> 01:17:13,586
Who got your job back?

1035
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:17,289
I did!

1036
01:17:17,355 --> 01:17:19,993
Who helped you win Shonali?

1037
01:17:20,525 --> 01:17:21,861
I did!

1038
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:25,032
And now you won’t listen to me?

1039
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:28,502
You've seen the
consequences of telling the truth.

1040
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:31,471
Now see what a lie can do.

1041
01:17:32,037 --> 01:17:33,940
Go to Shonali and tell her...

1042
01:17:34,372 --> 01:17:35,774
I won't go to the psychiatrist.

1043
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:37,776
What?

1044
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:40,380
Umm... l don't get any calls.

1045
01:17:43,481 --> 01:17:45,618
Karthik, are you lying to me?

1046
01:17:46,718 --> 01:17:48,721
Look me in the eyes.

1047
01:17:49,654 --> 01:17:51,457
You are lying to me!

1048
01:17:51,523 --> 01:17:51,523
You're lying, aren't you?

1049
01:17:52,591 --> 01:17:54,661
No, Shonali... l really...

1050
01:17:54,726 --> 01:17:56,663
don't get any calls.

1051
01:17:58,062 --> 01:17:59,230
l was kidding.

1052
01:18:02,032 --> 01:18:04,002
You're lying to me, aren't you?

1053
01:18:10,474 --> 01:18:11,609
Yes.

1054
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:17,851
Why don't you understand that
l can't go to the psychiatrist?

1055
01:18:17,915 --> 01:18:18,983
Why not?

1056
01:18:19,049 --> 01:18:21,052
Because he said so!

1057
01:18:21,418 --> 01:18:23,455
l trust his judgement.

1058
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,724
Following his advice
has always benefited me.

1059
01:18:25,922 --> 01:18:27,892
Well, this time it won't!

1060
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:31,597
l can't spend the rest of my life
with an unstable man.

1061
01:18:33,697 --> 01:18:33,697
And anyway you prefer
to spend your life with a phone...

1062
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:37,034
Wait!

1063
01:18:42,373 --> 01:18:43,675
Fine!

1064
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:52,817
I’ll go.

1065
01:18:55,885 --> 01:18:58,356
These calls are
your imagination, Karthik.

1066
01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:05,130
- Don't you believe me?
- It's not that l don't.

1067
01:19:06,029 --> 01:19:09,268
l believe that you think
you get these calls but...

1068
01:19:13,902 --> 01:19:16,307
Karthik, l need to tell you something.

1069
01:19:18,006 --> 01:19:20,544
l think, l know what this is.

1070
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:24,250
it’s an uncommon
psychological disorder.

1071
01:19:25,047 --> 01:19:28,554
It could be schizophrenia,
causing the hallucinations.

1072
01:19:29,017 --> 01:19:29,017
In this condition,
a man talks to people...

1073
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:34,591
who are only visible to him.

1074
01:19:34,657 --> 01:19:34,657
He thinks that these people are
telling him something...

1075
01:19:39,829 --> 01:19:43,068
through these calls, in your case.

1076
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:46,904
But this is
just a figment of imagination.

1077
01:19:49,037 --> 01:19:51,942
These... these aren't hallucinations.

1078
01:19:52,374 --> 01:19:52,374
it’s in your mind.

1079
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:56,513
These calls don't really come, Karthik.

1080
01:20:00,015 --> 01:20:02,185
Okay, tell me.

1081
01:20:02,684 --> 01:20:05,322
Have you received these calls
when others are present?

1082
01:20:08,557 --> 01:20:09,425
No.

1083
01:20:09,491 --> 01:20:12,797
Ever wonder why you get these calls,
only when you're alone?

1084
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:17,433
Okay...

1085
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:20,805
have you tried finding out
from where you get these calls?

1086
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,742
l did go,
to the telephone exchange.

1087
01:20:24,806 --> 01:20:26,308
- Okay and...

1088
01:20:29,577 --> 01:20:32,215
They said, l don't get any calls.

1089
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,448
See?

1090
01:20:34,215 --> 01:20:36,185
I’m not imagining this!

1091
01:20:47,361 --> 01:20:49,531
Karthik, please let me help you.

1092
01:20:50,498 --> 01:20:53,135
You have to try some medication,
you'll see the difference.

1093
01:20:53,868 --> 01:20:53,868
Medicines to cure what?

1094
01:20:55,736 --> 01:20:57,038
I’m... l am fine!

1095
01:21:01,876 --> 01:21:03,846
When do you get this call?

1096
01:21:06,647 --> 01:21:08,483
At five in the morning.

1097
01:21:11,585 --> 01:21:15,425
l don't do this usually, but I’m
going to make an exception for you.

1098
01:21:17,858 --> 01:21:20,095
Can l come over to your place?

1099
01:21:20,861 --> 01:21:23,232
l want to see for myself that
you get the call.

1100
01:21:23,563 --> 01:21:24,531
Sure!

1101
01:21:25,565 --> 01:21:29,139
Then you will know for sure,
that this isn't my imagination.

1102
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:34,109
And please tell Shonali
that I’m not crazy!

1103
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:27,427
Hello, good morning.

1104
01:22:27,493 --> 01:22:28,828
Is she here?

1105
01:22:29,828 --> 01:22:30,963
So...

1106
01:22:31,663 --> 01:22:33,633
she turned pale
when the phone rang?

1107
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:37,571
Switch on the speakerphone.

1108
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:40,775
Go on, talk to him.

1109
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,747
- Hello...
- Hello, Dr Kapadia.

1110
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:50,553
So tell me,
you've known me all these years.

1111
01:22:51,082 --> 01:22:54,823
You should know by now,
that I never lie.

1112
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:58,758
If I said I exist, that means I do.

1113
01:22:59,992 --> 01:23:01,995
it’s one of your friends, right?

1114
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:05,132
How do I convince you,
I really am Karthik?

1115
01:23:05,496 --> 01:23:07,900
I too am Karthik.

1116
01:23:07,965 --> 01:23:07,965
What can I say to convince you?

1117
01:23:09,867 --> 01:23:13,274
That you kept me
waiting for an hour today?

1118
01:23:13,337 --> 01:23:13,337
That you took notes ten times
during the session?

1119
01:23:16,707 --> 01:23:16,707
You checked your watch twice...

1120
01:23:18,543 --> 01:23:21,247
and you didn’t have
change for thousand rupees?

1121
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,787
Why can’t you believe
that I exist, damn it!!

1122
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:29,055
That my calls help?

1123
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:29,119
That I've achieved somethíng...

1124
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:34,094
you and your therapy
couldn’t for years??

1125
01:23:40,163 --> 01:23:40,163
On the contrary, you're telling him
that I don’t exist.

1126
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:44,200
That I am not real.

1127
01:23:46,536 --> 01:23:46,536
Karthik is like a child, Qr Kapadia.

1128
01:23:49,873 --> 01:23:52,445
He needs me.

1129
01:23:52,509 --> 01:23:55,013
You have children too, don’t you?

1130
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:55,378
How would you feel,
if someone told them...

1131
01:23:57,914 --> 01:24:00,118
that you don’t exist?

1132
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:01,585
That you aren’t real?

1133
01:24:01,651 --> 01:24:05,257
Or if someone were to tell you
that your kids...

1134
01:24:06,656 --> 01:24:10,329
Your kids are
in school, aren't they?

1135
01:24:11,995 --> 01:24:14,065
You think they are safe there?

1136
01:24:20,336 --> 01:24:20,336
What??

1137
01:24:21,738 --> 01:24:23,707
She ran away?

1138
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:26,443
You're telling me that
your psychiatrist is also mad?

1139
01:24:27,077 --> 01:24:30,249
Why can't you just accept
that this call is a part of my life?

1140
01:24:30,379 --> 01:24:32,116
Because, it's not possible, Karthik.

1141
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:34,518
But, Dr Kapadia spoke with him.

1142
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,122
Okay!
This isn't your imagination!

1143
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:39,990
That means someone is
making a fool out of you.

1144
01:24:41,323 --> 01:24:42,291
No.

1145
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:48,899
l know what to do.

1146
01:25:06,514 --> 01:25:08,484
Don't be scared,
I’m there with you.

1147
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:10,854
Shona, do l look scared?

1148
01:25:11,352 --> 01:25:13,422
Whoever it is,
we'll have him arrested.

1149
01:25:15,223 --> 01:25:17,126
Stop being absurd!

1150
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:19,162
Oh really! I’m being absurd?

1151
01:25:23,464 --> 01:25:23,464
He said nobody would believe.

1152
01:25:25,299 --> 01:25:25,299
Who said that?

1153
01:25:26,734 --> 01:25:27,969
He did!

1154
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:35,744
Don't answer it!

1155
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:35,810
- What??
- Just leave it unanswered.

1156
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:38,311
Have you ever ignored it?

1157
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:43,721
You haven't, right?
Let's see what happens.

1158
01:25:45,318 --> 01:25:45,318
- But Shona...
- No, Karthik!

1159
01:25:47,387 --> 01:25:49,759
Let it ring!
Let's see what happens.

1160
01:25:49,824 --> 01:25:52,061
He will call for
a couple of days and stop.

1161
01:25:52,492 --> 01:25:54,562
Shonali, he'll feel bad.

1162
01:25:54,628 --> 01:25:56,698
And if you answer, then l will.

1163
01:25:57,464 --> 01:25:59,668
Just let it ring!

1164
01:26:13,247 --> 01:26:15,417
- l have to answer it...
- Don't answer, Karthik.

1165
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:15,482
Don't worry.

1166
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:19,588
it’s not like someone is
going to step out and kill you.

1167
01:26:51,851 --> 01:26:55,525
I’m sorry.
Actually, sir...

1168
01:26:58,824 --> 01:26:58,824
these bills have been
pending for three months.

1169
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:04,365
-The lights were on,
so thought you might be awake.

1170
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:15,241
l need to leave, Karthik.

1171
01:28:11,963 --> 01:28:12,998
Are you okay?

1172
01:28:17,368 --> 01:28:18,871
Did you answer the phone?

1173
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,213
Sweetheart...

1174
01:28:31,282 --> 01:28:33,452
Don't answer the calls
and everything will be alright.

1175
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:36,820
Everything will be ruined!

1176
01:28:38,356 --> 01:28:39,591
No, it won't!

1177
01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:42,061
Why don't you understand that
I’m nothing without the calls?

1178
01:28:42,326 --> 01:28:44,029
That's not true, Karthik.

1179
01:28:44,494 --> 01:28:45,896
You are an intelligent and fun guy.

1180
01:28:46,163 --> 01:28:47,499
No, I’m not!

1181
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:50,969
Did you even notice me before?

1182
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:53,371
Did it ever matter to you
if l were alive or not?

1183
01:28:53,737 --> 01:28:55,272
It mattered to him.

1184
01:28:55,873 --> 01:28:57,442
He became my friend,
my guardian, my guide...

1185
01:28:57,506 --> 01:28:58,708
he fixed everything!

1186
01:28:59,009 --> 01:29:01,646
You are a part of my life
because of him.

1187
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:06,051
And now you have
a problem with him?

1188
01:29:11,154 --> 01:29:12,289
See!

1189
01:29:13,489 --> 01:29:15,459
Now you don't want to be with me.

1190
01:29:16,058 --> 01:29:16,058
He said you wouldn't understand.

1191
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,230
What do you want me to understand??

1192
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:22,066
Do you know who he is,
where he lives...

1193
01:29:22,131 --> 01:29:23,132
his whereabouts...

1194
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,138
How does it matter?
He has helped me a lot.

1195
01:29:28,471 --> 01:29:30,273
And l will talk to him.

1196
01:29:38,681 --> 01:29:40,183
Shona...

1197
01:29:41,516 --> 01:29:43,486
l need to speak to him.

1198
01:29:46,355 --> 01:29:48,659
How can l
keep you happy without his help?

1199
01:29:50,459 --> 01:29:51,794
Please...

1200
01:29:57,133 --> 01:29:57,133
You need help, Karthik.

1201
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,436
He is the help, Shona.

1202
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:05,274
l will talk to him...

1203
01:30:09,144 --> 01:30:11,114
Are you with me?

1204
01:31:11,905 --> 01:31:13,875
You were right.

1205
01:31:16,143 --> 01:31:18,113
No one will understand.

1206
01:31:21,714 --> 01:31:23,684
l shouldn't have told anyone.

1207
01:31:38,232 --> 01:31:40,201
Hello... Karthik...

1208
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:42,803
I’m sorry, l didn't...

1209
01:31:46,072 --> 01:31:50,280
You made a big mistake, Karthik.

1210
01:31:50,343 --> 01:31:52,313
Very big!

1211
01:31:53,446 --> 01:31:55,349
Didn’t l warn you?

1212
01:31:56,015 --> 01:31:57,985
Not to tell anyone.

1213
01:31:58,184 --> 01:32:00,087
Yet you did!

1214
01:32:01,287 --> 01:32:01,287
I told you
not to see the psychiatrist...

1215
01:32:04,223 --> 01:32:07,128
but you actually brought her home!

1216
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:07,860
and then...

1217
01:32:09,861 --> 01:32:12,833
yesterday you crossed the limits!

1218
01:32:14,067 --> 01:32:16,104
You didn’t answer my call.

1219
01:32:16,169 --> 01:32:18,038
My call!?

1220
01:32:18,637 --> 01:32:20,607
How dare you?

1221
01:32:21,574 --> 01:32:25,515
Now you'll have to pay for it?

1222
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:30,720
Do you think that
if I can take you to the top...

1223
01:32:30,782 --> 01:32:33,153
l can't bring you down??

1224
01:32:33,885 --> 01:32:38,894
Just watch as
I ruin your life in a flash!

1225
01:32:40,459 --> 01:32:42,429
Please... listen to me...

1226
01:32:43,228 --> 01:32:45,198
- You...
- You are finished!

1227
01:32:46,398 --> 01:32:48,068
Now...

1228
01:32:48,133 --> 01:32:51,472
I’m going to bring you down!

1229
01:32:53,071 --> 01:32:55,041
You took Shonali's advice, didn’t you?

1230
01:32:56,274 --> 01:32:58,077
Just wait.

1231
01:32:58,376 --> 01:33:01,849
You are finished, Karthik.

1232
01:33:03,681 --> 01:33:04,716
finished!

1233
01:33:04,782 --> 01:33:07,154
Karthik, please listen to me.

1234
01:33:08,119 --> 01:33:10,457
You never let me speak... please...

1235
01:33:12,657 --> 01:33:14,026
Hello...

1236
01:33:15,993 --> 01:33:17,328
hello...

1237
01:33:18,996 --> 01:33:20,064
hello...

1238
01:33:31,175 --> 01:33:33,880
Sir, hurry up,
Mr Kamath is waiting for you.

1239
01:33:40,184 --> 01:33:41,152
Yes, sir?

1240
01:33:41,685 --> 01:33:43,588
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1241
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:47,226
You think you can blackmail me,
you son of a bitch?

1242
01:33:48,325 --> 01:33:48,325
Sir, what happened?

1243
01:33:49,193 --> 01:33:49,193
You think, if you
call me at night and...

1244
01:33:51,195 --> 01:33:53,165
threaten me, I’ll get scared?

1245
01:33:53,564 --> 01:33:53,564
No, sir... l didn't call you.

1246
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:56,567
Don't lie to me!!

1247
01:33:56,634 --> 01:33:56,634
l know it is you who called.

1248
01:33:58,034 --> 01:34:00,939
You threatened to
tell my wife about my affairs!

1249
01:34:01,004 --> 01:34:02,707
You bastard!

1250
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:03,440
No, sir.
l really didn't call.

1251
01:34:05,643 --> 01:34:05,643
Only you knew about it.

1252
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:10,047
You think
l don't recognise your voice?

1253
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,683
It was you!

1254
01:34:12,782 --> 01:34:12,782
- Listen Karthik,
you maybe very good...

1255
01:34:14,618 --> 01:34:17,589
with your work, all your accounts and
figures, but now you've gotten personal!!

1256
01:34:19,055 --> 01:34:20,056
Sir...

1257
01:34:20,823 --> 01:34:22,225
it wasn't me, sir...

1258
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:23,627
It wasn't you?

1259
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,063
Listen to me very carefully!

1260
01:34:26,129 --> 01:34:26,129
If you ever call my home again...

1261
01:34:28,398 --> 01:34:28,398
I’ll bury you in cement
in the basement of this very office.

1262
01:34:32,402 --> 01:34:34,773
I’ll bury you,
do you understand me?

1263
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:37,140
You're finished!

1264
01:34:41,211 --> 01:34:43,882
home loan, pension plan,
everything is finished!!

1265
01:34:44,547 --> 01:34:46,918
You will never work
in this industry again!

1266
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:48,050
- Now you get out of my office...
- Sir, really...

1267
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:52,022
Get out!
Get out of my office!!

1268
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:09,238
Yes, Mr Ratan...

1269
01:35:09,938 --> 01:35:11,440
- Karthik!

1270
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:15,879
You called Mr Ratan
and told him...

1271
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:15,944
that the Thane land is illegal.

1272
01:35:17,446 --> 01:35:17,446
No, sir... l didn't call him.

1273
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:18,480
Because of you,
l have lost eight hundred million!

1274
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:20,515
Can you understand me?
Eight hundred million!!

1275
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:24,086
They're suing us,
you son of a bitch!

1276
01:35:24,152 --> 01:35:24,152
We're ruined!
I’m going to kill you right here.

1277
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:28,123
- Sir...
- Right here, I’m going to kill you.

1278
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:30,025
- Sir...
- Sir... sir, stop it...

1279
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,729
Leave me!!

1280
01:35:34,496 --> 01:35:37,033
Security, remove him from the premises!

1281
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:05,160
How could you, Karthik?

1282
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:05,493
How could you say all those things?

1283
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:07,495
What did l say?

1284
01:36:08,729 --> 01:36:10,399
As if you don't know!

1285
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,503
Karthik, you called me
a slut and a prostitute!

1286
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:16,672
You said I’ve been with
everyone in the office...

1287
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:18,541
When did l say that?

1288
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:18,606
Who told you l said that?

1289
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:20,408
Who??

1290
01:36:22,876 --> 01:36:25,080
You did, Karthik,
last night on the phone.

1291
01:36:26,179 --> 01:36:28,249
You made fun of me.
You accused me!

1292
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:32,822
You mocked all the private feelings
l shared with you, only you.

1293
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,624
l didn't call you, Shona.
Believe me that was him!

1294
01:36:37,357 --> 01:36:39,094
You think I’m stupid??

1295
01:36:39,492 --> 01:36:41,395
It was you, Karthik.

1296
01:36:42,195 --> 01:36:44,165
And you know what...

1297
01:36:44,531 --> 01:36:46,067
l never want to
see your face again!

1298
01:36:54,607 --> 01:36:56,610
l can't believe
l thought you were special!

1299
01:37:10,155 --> 01:37:10,155
Now you'll pay for your actions?

1300
01:37:13,827 --> 01:37:17,333
You are finished, Karthik.

1301
01:37:19,064 --> 01:37:21,034
finished!

1302
01:37:51,897 --> 01:37:54,101
Sir, the card was declined.

1303
01:37:54,165 --> 01:37:55,434
What?

1304
01:37:57,703 --> 01:37:57,703
it’s a debit card,
not a credit card.

1305
01:37:59,538 --> 01:37:59,538
How can it be declined?

1306
01:38:00,706 --> 01:38:02,676
Whatever!
The payment didn't go through.

1307
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:06,945
Sir, your account has zero balance.

1308
01:38:07,044 --> 01:38:08,279
You have no money!

1309
01:38:09,815 --> 01:38:11,785
But all my savings were in that account.

1310
01:38:12,984 --> 01:38:15,188
Yesterday there was
a balance of about one and half million.

1311
01:38:15,486 --> 01:38:15,486
Sir, last night,
using the telebanking service...

1312
01:38:18,389 --> 01:38:20,025
you transferred all your funds.

1313
01:38:20,825 --> 01:38:20,825
How is that possible?

1314
01:38:22,059 --> 01:38:23,628
- Sir, through telebanking.

1315
01:38:23,694 --> 01:38:23,694
- You verify your password,
your PIN number, your...

1316
01:38:25,563 --> 01:38:27,533
l know what telebanking is!

1317
01:38:28,733 --> 01:38:30,035
Where has my money
been transferred to?

1318
01:38:31,502 --> 01:38:33,706
Sir, you transferred it to... umm...

1319
01:38:33,838 --> 01:38:35,808
a Foundation for Children Fund.

1320
01:38:39,444 --> 01:38:39,444
l do donate five thousand
to that account, every month...

1321
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:42,880
but l didn't transfer everything.

1322
01:38:44,882 --> 01:38:47,253
Sir, you transferred everything yesterday.

1323
01:38:57,027 --> 01:39:01,001
Now I’m going to
take it all back, Karthik!

1324
01:39:02,934 --> 01:39:02,934
Now...

1325
01:39:04,601 --> 01:39:04,601
I’m going to bring you down!

1326
01:39:05,635 --> 01:39:07,939
I’m going to bring you down!

1327
01:39:09,172 --> 01:39:13,045
You are finished, Karthik.

1328
01:39:14,511 --> 01:39:16,481
finished!

1329
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:51,280
Excuse me...

1330
01:39:53,849 --> 01:39:56,387
can you do me a favour, please?

1331
01:39:56,452 --> 01:39:56,452
Will you buy a ticket for me?

1332
01:39:58,187 --> 01:40:00,591
- To where?
-Any city...

1333
01:40:00,656 --> 01:40:02,626
but don't tell me which city.

1334
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:06,797
Here is the money.

1335
01:40:07,663 --> 01:40:10,769
Just tell me
the platform number, please.

1336
01:41:23,337 --> 01:41:25,908
You need to get off here.

1337
01:41:27,474 --> 01:41:29,377
Can you help me alight?

1338
01:41:30,544 --> 01:41:32,547
Excuse me... please give him a hand...

1339
01:41:40,454 --> 01:41:42,123
- Here's the rickshaw.

1340
01:41:45,459 --> 01:41:47,428
- Thank you...
- It's alright.

1341
01:41:47,961 --> 01:41:47,961
Take me to a small hotel...

1342
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:53,469
- Which one?
- Any hotel will do.

1343
01:41:59,139 --> 01:42:01,009
Welcome, sir.

1344
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:01,340
Okay, sir...

1345
01:42:02,675 --> 01:42:03,676
Thank you.

1346
01:42:03,877 --> 01:42:06,281
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1347
01:42:07,014 --> 01:42:08,583
How much for two weeks?

1348
01:42:08,881 --> 01:42:11,553
Single room,
daily six hundred fifty rupees.

1349
01:42:11,617 --> 01:42:14,322
Eight thousand rupees for two weeks.
Discount price, sir.

1350
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,223
Here's ten thousand.

1351
01:42:16,689 --> 01:42:18,058
Do me a favour.

1352
01:42:18,457 --> 01:42:21,696
Disconnect the phone
in my room and remove it.

1353
01:42:21,994 --> 01:42:24,999
Also remove all the stationery.

1354
01:42:25,297 --> 01:42:25,297
The TV too and
also the room number sign.

1355
01:42:29,502 --> 01:42:31,906
Don't deliver the newspaper, please.

1356
01:42:32,038 --> 01:42:32,038
Don't disturb me at all.

1357
01:42:33,539 --> 01:42:37,713
Deliver the meals to the room.

1358
01:43:23,387 --> 01:43:25,725
Now even l don't know where l am...

1359
01:43:27,357 --> 01:43:29,695
so how will he?

1360
01:44:23,713 --> 01:44:25,883
Here...

1361
01:44:31,721 --> 01:44:35,361
l hope you like the food...

1362
01:44:36,126 --> 01:44:38,028
Of course, l do.

1363
01:44:38,361 --> 01:44:40,665
- I’ll leave now.
- Bye.

1364
01:44:52,275 --> 01:44:57,118
What brought about this sadness...

1365
01:44:58,114 --> 01:45:00,518
Oh heart of mine...

1366
01:45:03,552 --> 01:45:07,861
and with it such painful loneliness...

1367
01:45:09,325 --> 01:45:11,862
Oh heart of mine...

1368
01:45:15,463 --> 01:45:15,463
Every step the silence of the memories _ream...

1369
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:26,246
The eyes ache with sorrow, but shed no tear...

1370
01:45:26,474 --> 01:45:35,090
Oh answer... why is it so?

1371
01:45:37,519 --> 01:45:45,768
Why forsakes me, the bright glow?

1372
01:45:48,763 --> 01:45:48,763
What brought about this sadness...

1373
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:56,773
Oh heart of mine...

1374
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:12,320
People... they come and go...

1375
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:21,902
You know... it's always been so...

1376
01:46:23,697 --> 01:46:26,569
Everyone left, they're here no more...

1377
01:46:26,634 --> 01:46:33,413
How does it help to cry yourself sore?

1378
01:46:34,641 --> 01:46:34,641
They remember you no more...

1379
01:46:37,144 --> 01:46:39,681
Letting go is the only cure...

1380
01:46:40,314 --> 01:46:42,551
Or with me...

1381
01:46:42,615 --> 01:46:45,187
This agony, you too can endure...

1382
01:46:45,551 --> 01:46:49,592
Trust me...

1383
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:54,231
Oh heart of mine...

1384
01:46:56,629 --> 01:47:01,705
forget the past...

1385
01:47:01,768 --> 01:47:05,274
It's never meant to last?

1386
01:47:07,807 --> 01:47:11,948
What brought about this sadness...

1387
01:47:12,045 --> 01:47:14,683
Goodbyes hurt most
when you don't get to say them.

1388
01:47:16,049 --> 01:47:18,586
It wasn't my fault, Shonali.

1389
01:47:44,377 --> 01:47:44,377
- Hello...
- Hi, this is Dr Kapadia here.

1390
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:47,080
- Hello...
- Hi, this is Dr Kapadia here.

1391
01:47:47,145 --> 01:47:47,145
Sorry to disturb you in the office but...

1392
01:47:49,848 --> 01:47:49,848
but l need to meet Karthik.

1393
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:53,720
Do you know where he is?

1394
01:47:53,785 --> 01:47:53,785
- No... umm...

1395
01:47:55,387 --> 01:47:57,057
- actually, I’ve been
trying to contact him but...

1396
01:47:57,122 --> 01:47:58,692
- l have no idea where he is.

1397
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:01,559
Okay.

1398
01:48:02,928 --> 01:48:07,102
Okay, can you please call me
if you hear from him?

1399
01:48:07,532 --> 01:48:09,035
- Yes, Of course.

1400
01:48:09,101 --> 01:48:11,104
Thanks... bye.

1401
01:48:13,505 --> 01:48:15,208
-Thank you very much.
- Welcome, sir.

1402
01:48:15,273 --> 01:48:15,273
- And thanks to you also.
- Thank you, sir.

1403
01:48:17,209 --> 01:48:19,913
l really appreciate your help.
Thank you very much.

1404
01:48:22,481 --> 01:48:25,153
Well done, Karthik.
You handled that like a pro.

1405
01:48:25,883 --> 01:48:27,720
Thank you, sir.

1406
01:48:27,785 --> 01:48:30,624
Actually, you know,
you are over qualified for this job.

1407
01:48:31,022 --> 01:48:34,429
You should be some where else
in a bigger firm...

1408
01:48:34,493 --> 01:48:36,463
No, sir... l like it here.

1409
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:40,099
Peace of mind is essential
and l found it here in Cochin.

1410
01:48:42,867 --> 01:48:42,867
You're one strange fellow.

1411
01:48:44,702 --> 01:48:46,004
And l keep telling you that!

1412
01:48:52,877 --> 01:48:53,778
- Karthik...
- Yes, sir.

1413
01:48:53,844 --> 01:48:55,680
- Sit... sit...
- No, sir... it's okay.

1414
01:48:56,013 --> 01:48:59,018
I’m going to Dubai next week
and l need to be in touch with you.

1415
01:48:59,383 --> 01:49:00,886
We'll be in touch on email, sir.

1416
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,955
l need you to get a phone.

1417
01:49:06,756 --> 01:49:07,924
Karthik?

1418
01:49:08,592 --> 01:49:10,629
- Phone, Karthik...
- Sir...

1419
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,697
it’s not necessary, sir.

1420
01:49:12,996 --> 01:49:14,899
What do you mean?

1421
01:49:16,833 --> 01:49:19,805
You neither have
a mobile nor a landline.

1422
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:20,670
No, no... l insist!

1423
01:49:22,373 --> 01:49:24,375
You have to get a phone.

1424
01:49:24,442 --> 01:49:26,311
Please, sir, l don't want a phone.

1425
01:49:26,943 --> 01:49:29,848
Sir, l have a problem with mobiles.

1426
01:49:30,447 --> 01:49:32,150
Then get a landline!

1427
01:49:36,286 --> 01:49:38,456
- Landline, sir?
- Karthik...

1428
01:49:39,122 --> 01:49:42,428
I’m not asking you,
I’m telling you.

1429
01:49:44,928 --> 01:49:47,732
You said you want
payment in cash, l agreed.

1430
01:49:48,298 --> 01:49:50,602
You said you won't travel,
l agreed.

1431
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:54,840
You said you won't go to
the Mumbai head office, l agreed.

1432
01:49:56,306 --> 01:49:58,176
Won't you agree to this request?

1433
01:49:58,308 --> 01:50:00,345
Come on, get a landline, quick!

1434
01:50:12,988 --> 01:50:14,725
- Yes, we will allot the number now...

1435
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:17,427
but the wireman will come tomorrow.

1436
01:50:17,493 --> 01:50:19,798
We are out of handsets,
you'll need to buy your own.

1437
01:50:20,663 --> 01:50:22,900
Please do me a favour.

1438
01:50:23,031 --> 01:50:26,437
Don't print my number in the directory.
l want to keep it private.

1439
01:50:29,938 --> 01:50:32,142
Mention it in the form
and it will be done.

1440
01:50:34,443 --> 01:50:38,751
And don't even tell me the number.

1441
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:39,780
But it will be printed on the bill.

1442
01:50:42,151 --> 01:50:44,321
Then don't send the bill.

1443
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:45,420
What?

1444
01:50:46,821 --> 01:50:50,361
If you wish, I’ll pay
the yearly charge in advance.

1445
01:50:51,025 --> 01:50:53,363
l don't want a bill.

1446
01:50:53,629 --> 01:50:58,104
Actually, l don't want to
know the number either.

1447
01:50:58,634 --> 01:51:02,273
You could write it on a paper.

1448
01:51:05,306 --> 01:51:06,976
Sir, my telephone number.

1449
01:51:07,275 --> 01:51:08,778
Sir...

1450
01:51:09,443 --> 01:51:11,446
please don't tell anyone.

1451
01:51:13,281 --> 01:51:14,817
Not even me.

1452
01:51:14,882 --> 01:51:17,186
- You don't know your own number?
- No, sir.

1453
01:51:18,686 --> 01:51:20,356
You really are strange!

1454
01:51:57,691 --> 01:51:59,528
Why are you thinking so much?

1455
01:51:59,759 --> 01:52:01,897
- You're selecting a phone, not a bride!

1456
01:52:02,195 --> 01:52:03,932
l don't get any calls.

1457
01:52:03,997 --> 01:52:07,303
Only if you buy a phone,
will you know if anyone calls.

1458
01:56:13,475 --> 01:56:15,612
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1459
01:56:16,978 --> 01:56:18,815
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1460
01:56:22,416 --> 01:56:24,419
Everything is fine now, Shonali.

1461
01:56:25,787 --> 01:56:27,757
I’m free from the calls.

1462
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:31,560
Sorry for what happened.

1463
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:34,529
Maybe some day
we can be together again.

1464
01:56:53,313 --> 01:56:54,682
- Kavita...
- Yes?

1465
01:56:54,748 --> 01:56:56,885
Can you please book me
a ticket to Mumbai for tomorrow?

1466
01:57:02,789 --> 01:57:04,191
Hi... I’m Shonali.

1467
01:57:04,591 --> 01:57:06,126
Hi, Shonali, I’m Shweta.

1468
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,632
When you called you said,
you've news about Karthik.

1469
01:57:09,863 --> 01:57:12,735
In fact l just received an email today,
after a long time.

1470
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:15,269
Okay, l need you to
tell me something.

1471
01:57:16,003 --> 01:57:16,003
Sure!

1472
01:57:17,004 --> 01:57:18,239
Did Karthik have a brother?

1473
01:57:19,372 --> 01:57:20,540
Of course not.

1474
01:57:20,606 --> 01:57:21,976
And you're sure about this?

1475
01:57:22,108 --> 01:57:23,243
Absolutely!

1476
01:57:23,911 --> 01:57:26,782
l met his sister, his cousin sister.

1477
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:29,951
She told me a lot about him.

1478
01:57:30,349 --> 01:57:32,219
Karthik is an only child.

1479
01:57:32,351 --> 01:57:34,054
He has no brother.

1480
01:57:37,356 --> 01:57:39,259
My suspicions were aroused.

1481
01:57:39,325 --> 01:57:41,194
About what?

1482
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:43,564
Since childhood he has been disturbed.

1483
01:57:45,031 --> 01:57:48,738
Karthik thought he had a brother.

1484
01:57:48,801 --> 01:57:52,642
And he came to me,
due to the guilt about his death but...

1485
01:57:53,806 --> 01:57:55,441
his brother wasn't real.

1486
01:57:56,241 --> 01:58:00,817
l had to suffer Kumar's taunts,
his anger everyday.

1487
01:58:01,948 --> 01:58:06,156
Mom and dad never believed
that he troubled me.

1488
01:58:07,252 --> 01:58:08,420
They never believed me.

1489
01:58:09,855 --> 01:58:12,092
He never did anything in their presence.

1490
01:58:13,491 --> 01:58:13,491
Shonali...

1491
01:58:14,859 --> 01:58:16,562
Karthik is schizophrenic.

1492
01:58:20,365 --> 01:58:22,102
- Karthik's parents
didn't believe him because...

1493
01:58:23,535 --> 01:58:25,405
only Karthik saw his brother.

1494
01:58:25,837 --> 01:58:27,039
- He was imaginary.

1495
01:58:27,472 --> 01:58:27,472
How is it related to the phone calls??

1496
01:58:31,509 --> 01:58:35,550
the 'Karthik' who calls
is imaginary.

1497
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,816
A figment of his imagination.

1498
01:58:38,016 --> 01:58:41,055
Imagination??
But I’ve seen the phone ring!

1499
01:58:41,285 --> 01:58:41,285
I’m not saying
the phone calls don't come .

1500
01:58:43,354 --> 01:58:47,896
All I’m saying is
this person that Karthik talks to...

1501
01:58:48,359 --> 01:58:50,663
is created by Karthik's mind.

1502
01:58:50,962 --> 01:58:53,166
Didn't you speak with him??

1503
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,430
Exactly!

1504
01:58:54,665 --> 01:58:56,635
And l got fooled too.

1505
01:58:57,835 --> 01:59:02,678
But l kept wondering,
how the voice l had heard...

1506
01:59:02,773 --> 01:59:04,676
could be Karthik's.

1507
01:59:04,742 --> 01:59:07,647
And then a few days ago,
l came across this.

1508
01:59:51,287 --> 01:59:52,756
- Please set time.

1509
01:59:56,259 --> 01:59:59,598
- Time set five a.m.
Please record message.

1510
01:59:59,862 --> 02:00:01,832
Remember me, Karthik?

1511
02:00:04,266 --> 02:00:06,236
Did you think...

1512
02:00:07,603 --> 02:00:09,305
that I’d let you be?

1513
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:11,976
You're going to wish you were dead!

1514
02:00:13,142 --> 02:00:16,348
And now,
I’m going to get you, Karthik.

1515
02:00:16,746 --> 02:00:19,217
l found you.

1516
02:00:23,485 --> 02:00:25,288
- Message saved.

1517
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:43,974
- Karthik used to call himself?

1518
02:00:44,139 --> 02:00:45,442
Oh my God!

1519
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:50,714
It has many amazing features.

1520
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:54,318
Alarm, calendar, self reminder...

1521
02:00:54,516 --> 02:00:56,586
If you want to remember something...

1522
02:00:56,685 --> 02:01:00,759
dial O-O-2-6 and
record a message in your own voice.

1523
02:01:00,822 --> 02:01:00,822
This will be recorded on the handset.

1524
02:01:03,191 --> 02:01:04,894
- A reminder for anything.

1525
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,763
- You can even set the timer.

1526
02:01:06,862 --> 02:01:10,001
Say you want a reminder at nine a.m.
before leaving for work.

1527
02:01:10,498 --> 02:01:12,301
-The phone will ring at nine sharp!

1528
02:01:12,366 --> 02:01:15,271
- When you answer,
you can hear the message.

1529
02:01:15,469 --> 02:01:17,806
If you wish, you can record
a message for others too.

1530
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:20,177
Please listen to me.

1531
02:01:20,242 --> 02:01:20,242
You never let me speak, please...

1532
02:01:22,576 --> 02:01:26,082
- Even if the phone is dead,
the features will work.

1533
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:28,150
- Because this phone works on batteries.

1534
02:01:30,151 --> 02:01:33,190
-And if you don't record a new message,
it won't ring.

1535
02:01:35,356 --> 02:01:36,391
- Oh my God!

1536
02:01:36,690 --> 02:01:38,225
He needs help.

1537
02:01:38,292 --> 02:01:39,360
l need to get to him.

1538
02:01:39,426 --> 02:01:42,297
l need a flight to Cochin,
a night flight will do.

1539
02:01:42,930 --> 02:01:42,930
- But where is he?

1540
02:01:44,497 --> 02:01:46,969
- His email contained
the address of a courier company.

1541
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:48,770
I’ll figure out the rest.

1542
02:01:49,402 --> 02:01:49,402
- Our brain is unique, very complex.

1543
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:51,471
- Things we want to remember...

1544
02:01:53,974 --> 02:01:53,974
- what we think about, talk about...

1545
02:01:57,812 --> 02:02:00,716
- get stored in one part of the mind.

1546
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:02,183
- the conscious mind.

1547
02:02:02,249 --> 02:02:02,249
-And those little things,
that we don't really focus on...

1548
02:02:06,253 --> 02:02:06,253
- what we see, hear
but can't remember...

1549
02:02:10,456 --> 02:02:10,456
- are stored in another part.

1550
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:15,430
- the subconscious mind.

1551
02:02:15,595 --> 02:02:18,567
- The subconscious mind is
a very strange thing.

1552
02:02:19,532 --> 02:02:22,036
- Everything is stored there.

1553
02:02:23,303 --> 02:02:24,873
- It knows how we think...

1554
02:02:24,938 --> 02:02:24,938
- what we think,
what questions we'll ask...

1555
02:02:28,141 --> 02:02:28,141
What do you want to know?

1556
02:02:30,343 --> 02:02:31,713
The colour of your socks?

1557
02:02:31,811 --> 02:02:35,050
- Our personal things,
our secrets...

1558
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:38,387
Your bank PIN number is 1-2-7-6.

1559
02:02:38,685 --> 02:02:41,389
- It's because the
conscious and subconscious mind...

1560
02:02:41,453 --> 02:02:43,256
- are both present in the same brain.

1561
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:44,024
Wife?

1562
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:46,060
Why did you call on this number?

1563
02:02:46,625 --> 02:02:47,928
l already told you...

1564
02:02:48,427 --> 02:02:51,332
when l come  to Delhi,
I’ll visit Bunty's school.

1565
02:02:52,598 --> 02:02:55,737
- Several different personalities can
exist in one brain.

1566
02:02:56,402 --> 02:02:59,106
- In Karthik's case,
the other Karthik who calls.

1567
02:02:59,305 --> 02:02:59,305
- His alter ego...

1568
02:03:00,672 --> 02:03:02,742
- and Karthik probably doesn't know this.

1569
02:03:02,975 --> 02:03:06,515
- No one knows how severe
this problem can be.

1570
02:03:07,179 --> 02:03:09,149
- the mind can act in very twisted ways.

1571
02:03:10,249 --> 02:03:12,219
- It's very rare but...

1572
02:03:12,751 --> 02:03:12,751
- l think Karthik could actually be...

1573
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:17,992
- suffering from
multiple mental disorders, Shonali.

1574
02:04:01,432 --> 02:04:02,367
Hello...

1575
02:04:07,805 --> 02:04:10,142
Remember me, Karthik?

1576
02:04:11,574 --> 02:04:11,574
Did you think...

1577
02:04:13,643 --> 02:04:15,780
that I'd let you be?

1578
02:04:17,281 --> 02:04:19,652
You thought you were safe from me?

1579
02:04:20,952 --> 02:04:22,754
No, Karthik.

1580
02:04:23,687 --> 02:04:26,659
Now you are finished.

1581
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:31,231
See how I ruin your life.

1582
02:04:33,163 --> 02:04:35,935
You're going to wish
you were dead, Karthik.

1583
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:37,600
Did you think...

1584
02:04:38,802 --> 02:04:41,507
that l wouldn’t find you in Cochin?

1585
02:04:46,510 --> 02:04:47,912
Guess what?

1586
02:04:48,578 --> 02:04:49,947
You were wrong.

1587
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:51,915
Again!

1588
02:04:53,316 --> 02:04:56,015
I found you

1589
02:04:57,378 --> 02:05:01,812
And now, I'm going to get you.

1590
02:05:06,628 --> 02:05:12,606
With you I am, by your side...

1591
02:05:13,169 --> 02:05:19,381
Not a memory, you cast by the wayside...

1592
02:05:25,014 --> 02:05:30,925
I'm always around...

1593
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:37,598
Be there gladness or sorrow...

1594
02:05:37,793 --> 02:05:43,637
Every moment, I have you with me...

1595
02:05:44,433 --> 02:05:52,148
This is how it was meant to be...

1596
02:05:58,012 --> 02:06:03,923
At every corner and every step...

1597
02:06:04,652 --> 02:06:10,730
I'm there, in every breath...

1598
02:06:17,965 --> 02:06:23,876
With you I'll always abide...

1599
02:06:29,444 --> 02:06:36,024
I'm always around...

1600
02:06:36,584 --> 02:06:42,662
Be there gladness or sorrow...

1601
02:06:42,689 --> 02:06:48,767
Believe it or not, you are my own...

1602
02:07:02,742 --> 02:07:08,987
It's time you realise my being...

1603
02:07:09,683 --> 02:07:15,460
Time you accept you need me...

1604
02:07:16,523 --> 02:07:22,268
I just can’t let you be...

1605
02:07:22,828 --> 02:07:28,539
I complete you, why can’t you see?

1606
02:07:34,974 --> 02:07:40,885
I'm always around...

1607
02:07:41,581 --> 02:07:41,581
Be there gladness or sorrow...

1608
02:07:47,654 --> 02:07:54,033
Believe it or not, you are my own...

1609
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:49,648
Hello...

1610
02:08:51,416 --> 02:08:52,751
Yes, Dr Kapadia...

1611
02:08:58,523 --> 02:08:59,591
Karthik...

1612
02:09:03,228 --> 02:09:04,296
Karthik?

1613
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,072
it’s Dr Kapadia for you.

1614
02:09:21,311 --> 02:09:24,050
- Karthik, You need to do this.

1615
02:09:49,406 --> 02:09:50,474
Hello...

1616
02:09:51,408 --> 02:09:52,543
- Karthik...

1617
02:09:53,644 --> 02:09:55,314
- l thought, I’d call and wish you.

1618
02:09:55,812 --> 02:09:56,980
- Happy Birthday!

1619
02:09:59,283 --> 02:10:00,451
Thank you.

1620
02:10:01,451 --> 02:10:02,820
- How have you been?

1621
02:10:04,588 --> 02:10:06,725
I’m better, thanks.

1622
02:10:08,157 --> 02:10:10,294
- You're coming over
to see me on Monday, aren't you?

1623
02:10:12,094 --> 02:10:14,465
Yes... absolutely.

1624
02:10:15,431 --> 02:10:17,769
- Great! Take care.

1625
02:10:18,401 --> 02:10:19,771
- Happy birthday, once again.

1626
02:10:21,604 --> 02:10:22,672
Thanks.

1627
02:10:24,307 --> 02:10:25,308
Bye.
