1
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,960
Enemy has started
showing his colors.

2
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,560
He knows that the chains
of law are in my feet.

3
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
He wants to finish my sport.

4
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,640
Boss, should we also start our game?

5
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Look dear, in our business there
are only two types of..

6
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,640
..sports which keep us steady
in this business.

7
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
First is money and the second
is the politician.

8
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Chiman has minister on his side,
that's why he is jumping so much.

9
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,880
I will definitely avenge
Shah's death.

10
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,640
You know the boys, who have killed
Shah, don't you? - Yes.

11
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Find them out and tell this
to honest policemen.

12
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,120
Yes.

13
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,640
Now Janardan will play his game
keeping the cops in front of him.

14
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
Hello. - Sir, I know those guys who
have killed Shah.

15
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,880
Who are you?

16
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,560
They are hidden in the Golden Club.

17
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,800
Kiss my lips.

18
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,520
Krishna, Krishna, say, my love.

19
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Open your inner eyes!

20
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,720
Let the juices flow in your veins!

21
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
Sway in high spirits!

22
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,680
Just listen to me!

23
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

24
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,800
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

25
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
Krishna, Krishna, say, my love.

26
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,440
Open your inner eyes!

27
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,000
Let the juices flow in your veins!

28
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,120
Just listen to me!

29
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

30
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,160
Let the world say anything.

31
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,920
Let the world say anything.

32
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,520
Do not worry.

33
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,680
Enjoy yourself and
do not sigh in desire.

34
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,599
The more the bad name..

35
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
..the more is the fame.

36
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
Relief comes from
the feeling of pain.

37
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,439
All his works will
be done successfully.

38
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,199
Listen to me.

39
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,680
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

40
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,640
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

41
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,120
Kiss my lips.

42
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,480
With the heat of desires..

43
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,880
With the heat of desires,
the youth comes.

44
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,920
The one, who doesn't enjoy this,
repents all his life.

45
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
Life of a man can't be trusted.

46
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,790
Thus leave all your
attachments of life!

47
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,199
This moment you've of happiness,
enjoy it.

48
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,000
Listen to me.

49
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,320
Keep puffing!

50
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,680
Krishna, Krishna, say, my love.

51
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,240
Open your inner eyes!

52
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,800
Let the juices flow in your veins!

53
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,439
Sway in high spirits!

54
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,960
Just listen to me!

55
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,800
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

56
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

57
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,760
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

58
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Keep puffing! Keep puffing!

59
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,790
Let's go.

60
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,280
I am giving you half an hour.
Think and tell me.

61
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Will you give your statement
here or in the hospital?

62
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,120
Inspector, I keep people
like you in my pocket.

63
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,560
Vikram, what are you doing?
Cool down, Cool down, I say.

64
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
Behave yourself.

65
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,920
By apprehending these people
you have done a big job, Vikram.

66
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,160
By killing Shah openly
they tried to mock the police.

67
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,120
After their confession, the
curtain will lift from this crime..

68
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,520
..and very soon we will
be able to crush this mafia.

69
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,720
Now only they should speak!

70
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,240
I can get their mouths to open up,
anytime, sir.

71
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,400
I'll thrash them so much that they
will dissociate from crime, forever.

72
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
The honesty and enthusiasm,
that I see in you, for your job..

73
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,240
..it makes me proud of you!
- Thank you, sir.

74
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,790
Just keep your anger in control.

75
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,320
You know that you are
not a mere junior to me..

76
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,400
..but something else too.

77
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,560
I understand, sir.

78
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,439
I am not enjoying it.
Just show some hands. Massage hard.

79
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,520
I will make your life! C'mon.

80
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,239
Chiman Bhai, we are here to discuss.

81
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,720
That Inspector,
who arrested two of our men..

82
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,560
I heard, they have arrested
the two boys who killed Shah..

83
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,400
..I heard.

84
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,599
Brought from the factory.

85
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,280
Show me. - But due to these boys,
what problems will crop up in future..

86
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
..that we have to think, right?

87
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,400
..come to know that these
were the boys who killed Shah?

88
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,400
Chiman Bhai, if you don't feel bad,
shall I say something? - Say.

89
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,479
The police have been
informed by one of your men.

90
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,400
Lokhande, Chiman Bhai does
not keep chameleons in this gang.

91
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,360
Don't say something incorrect.

92
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,480
This is definitely the
handiwork of our enemies.

93
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,560
One minute.

94
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
This problem erupted
after Shah's death, right?

95
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,399
Who did Shah give
his financial support to?

96
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
The J Company. Janardan!

97
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,800
If Shah is killed then
who will feel the heat?

98
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,120
Janardhan. - Right.

99
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,439
But Chiman Bhai,
he is in jail, you mean from jail..

100
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
He is a bastard!

101
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,120
When he was in his mother's womb..

102
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
..he was planning
his first wedding night.

103
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,840
What is this nonsense
about his being in jail?

104
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,360
His men only informed
about our guys.

105
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,640
Saw, the same game which
I was afraid of has started.

106
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,760
First only I was saying that
enmity with Janardhan is not good.

107
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,199
Now we don't know what
turn this game takes in future!

108
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,240
Chiman Bhai,
Janardhan is not an ordinary person.

109
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,840
If he is not ordinary
then we aren't insects either.

110
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,960
Rascal, creating bad omen!

111
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,800
Chiman Bhai he..

112
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,680
I gave him a warning earlier too.
While discussing something good..

113
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
..he shouldn't create a bad omen.
Throw him out.

114
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,000
Osman Bhai's call! - Sit..sit.

115
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
Yes Osman Bhai, greetings.

116
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,800
Won't we trust for a few
millions in relation and friendship?

117
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,800
The goods will reach you.
Do not worry.

118
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,600
Osman Bhai, in my factory,
my men have made some pistols.

119
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Yes, so I am sending
you 5 - 10 pieces.

120
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
No, they are fine.
I have just used one.

121
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,800
Jerk is also less
and so is the noise.

122
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,280
Fine, I will send you some. Okay.

123
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,120
Once he takes them on remand,
it would create all problems..

124
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,360
Only if he could
take them on remand!

125
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,280
What's happening here?

126
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,320
They've been granted bail.
See the papers. Release them.

127
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Oh! So you have brought
their bail papers? - Yes.

128
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,720
Very good, what will you drink,
tea, coffee or cold drink?

129
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,720
No nothing,
I saw you and my stomach is full.

130
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,200
Chimanbhai Kathiawadi is my name!

131
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,680
My name is among the few
decent people of Mumbai city.

132
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,800
I have heard your name too,
that you are very strict.

133
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,160
But how much time will we
hear each other's name and do..

134
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,680
..our work,
so I thought I see you today.

135
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,120
This helps in creating a better
understanding later on, right?

136
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
To understand you, I do not
have to listen to your rubbish.

137
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,680
When you abuse Gujarati people,
you know what they think?

138
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
They think the other person
gave something and didn't take.

139
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,120
Say whatever you wish to say.

140
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,720
Now Chiman Bhai, it's like
this that I am also very much..

141
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,560
..bound by law, otherwise
I would show you everything..

142
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,680
..Gujarati, Marathi etc.

143
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
That you can do later.
Right now you see the court papers.

144
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,960
C'mon, sign here. Have you come to
police station for the first time?

145
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,399
And these two boys are not
hooligans, they work in my factory.

146
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,000
When Shah was killed,
these two were on duty.

147
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,360
The reason I am telling you this
is the next time before laying..

148
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
..your hands on my boys,
bring solid evidence with you.

149
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Show me whether you have
done your homework or not.

150
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,920
Yes, we have done.

151
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,960
Bunty, you show too.

152
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,880
Brother, you have come.

153
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,720
Good day, brother.

154
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,240
Sister, what happened to brother?

155
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,480
Brother is angry
and has gone to sleep.

156
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
Brother, don't act.
See, the children are calling.

157
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
Brother, please come.

158
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,560
Don't break their hearts,
please come.

159
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,880
Come, we'll take the children out.

160
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,440
Please come, please. - Let's go.

161
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,400
Silence.

162
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,240
Kids, please come.
Please come. Come.

163
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,800
Quiet..quiet..
I am not taking you all out.

164
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,760
We want to go out to play. - Quiet.

165
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,480
You'll sit here and study.

166
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I will go and bring
icecream for you all. Okay?

167
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,560
Yeah! Ice-cream! Ice-cream! Ice-cream!

168
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Shucks!

169
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,800
The car had to break down here only!

170
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,760
No doing any nonsense,
you must do what I am saying.

171
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,159
I am your husband
you are my husband.

172
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,400
The root of the problem
is we have no children.

173
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
Had been someone else,
I would've had 4 children at least.

174
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Tell you father, he was
after me for marriage, donkey.

175
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Dare not say donkey to my father.

176
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,600
Will say many times,
donkey, donkey, donkey!

177
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,800
I am giving you the last warning,
otherwise..

178
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,800
Otherwise what? - Otherwise what?

179
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,280
Take.

180
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,800
Glass broke?

181
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Oh mother!

182
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,840
Save me.

183
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,760
I am sorry. I am sorry.

184
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,200
You look very sweet
just like a chocolate.

185
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,719
Dolly, she's gone.
Thank you, thank you very much.

186
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,840
I am dead, she broke it.

187
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,320
The girl broke the glass and
went and you didn't say anything.

188
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,520
Otherwise you keep bossing around.

189
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,240
Now where has it disappeared?

190
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,720
Who is afraid?
Come and I will see to her!

191
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,240
Come, come. - What does
she think of herself? - See to her.

192
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,720
Trying to boss around?
I will just show her.

193
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
Come on, apply more strength!
- You too help me.

194
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,199
Okay. - Help me.

195
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,360
Come on. - Come out.

196
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,200
Come out.

197
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Yes. Come on. - Come on. Let's go.

198
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,840
Oh God!

199
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,679
Oh God!

200
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,400
Come.

201
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,240
Oh God! Look at that.

202
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Come on. Hurry up.

203
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,440
Wait. - Girl, stand there only.

204
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,600
See in our house, besides this
there's nothing. Break this too.

205
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,120
Do me a favor.
Break his head too. - Here.

206
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,879
What's the use of breaking
a head without brains?

207
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,320
Right, first time in life
someone has spoken the truth.

208
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,280
Shucks! My shoes are spoilt!

209
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,160
I will give you one, rascal!

210
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,360
Had come to buy ice cream for kids,
don't know where I got stuck.

211
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Where should I keep them?

212
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,399
Here.

213
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,600
Hey.

214
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,400
My shoe!

215
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,840
Stop! My shoe!

216
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,600
Hey girl! My shoe!

217
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,160
Stop!

218
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,120
My shoe!

219
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,840
Wait..

220
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,879
Shortcut.

221
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Where did she go?

222
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:33,879
Hey, my shoe! Wait..stop, my shoe!

223
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000
Stop! Hey girl!

224
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,440
Now, what else happened?

225
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,160
Oh, my shoe.

226
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,720
I don't know whose face
I saw early in the morning!

227
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,800
What is left in this car?

228
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,760
Hey mister.

229
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,480
What is it?
What is your life's problem?

230
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,400
I was screaming to stop the
car but you were not stopping it.

231
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,280
See the way I am sweating!
- Why should I stop?

232
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,400
Because my shoe is kept on your car.

233
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,239
Which shoe? - Look at this.

234
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,800
This shoe, this dirty shoe,
how did it come atop my car?

235
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,240
How did the shoe come atop your car?

236
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,399
Look this is a very tragic story.

237
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,800
I was coming walking from there.

238
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,520
I don't want to hear
your tragic story.

239
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,280
Remove this shoe.
- Try to understand me.

240
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,800
Remove this shoe.
- I was coming walking from there..

241
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,120
..and I stepped on tar.

242
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
I was trying to walk but could not.

243
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,160
Why are you looking like this?

244
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,520
Remove the shoe.

245
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,120
If you move aside, then
only I can remove the shoe. - Why?

246
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,760
Otherwise this time
I will fall on you.

247
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,439
Shut up.

248
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,440
If I made any mistake
then forgive me.

249
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,399
People like you should
be handed over to the police.

250
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,440
So you will hand
me over to the police?!

251
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,320
Right.

252
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,200
Will you complain against me?

253
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,840
Right.

254
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,440
Will you get me inside? - Right.

255
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,680
Okay, he's come.

256
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,280
Good, you have come here only.

257
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,600
See, this man has troubled me a lot,
put him inside.

258
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,160
Sir, shall I put this girl inside?

259
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,560
Oh no, you go, you go. - Okay.

260
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
I am known as
inspector Vikram Singh.

261
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,600
Are you an inspector?

262
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,480
Yes, I am an inspector.

263
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,800
If I would've told you earlier,
you wouldn't have fallen on me.

264
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,360
Shut up.

265
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,400
See, you are wonderful!

266
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,640
If you would have informed
me then I would come to the airport.

267
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,120
I have not come by plane.

268
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
I would've come to the station.

269
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,920
I haven't come by train also.

270
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,879
Then?

271
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,440
I have come in my personal car,
that too all alone.

272
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,840
Special style, you know.

273
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,320
What? - Yes.

274
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,920
What? Jaipur to Bombay by road?

275
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,360
That too all alone.

276
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,520
And drove yourself?

277
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
I don't understand anything.

278
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,639
What is there to understand in this?

279
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
What happened?

280
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,439
If I hadn't made this trip,
how could I have seen a new world?

281
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,400
And then how could I have met him!

282
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,440
Who is this 'Him'?

283
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,800
He is someone, loving, handsome..

284
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,680
Stop here.

285
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,400
Take this. - 75 paise more.

286
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,880
75 paise? I don't have the change.
Do you have? - No..

287
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
From where shall I bring?

288
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,439
All the shops are closed.

289
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,920
You are here. - I had come to spend
holidays with my friends.

290
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,479
Do you have 75 paise?

291
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,200
Yes, I have 75 paise!

292
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,960
Good, the work is done.

293
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,840
Here, take.

294
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,560
Thank you.

295
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,480
This meeting of ours is great.

296
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,600
Our last meeting was also great,
you remember..

297
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,400
..you on top of me, I below you.

298
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,600
Yes I remember.

299
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,000
You did not tell me your name.
- Divya.

300
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,720
Hi!

301
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,280
My 75 paise. - Oh, I forgot.

302
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
You forgot! - I'm so sorry.

303
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,320
Oh God, I don't have any change.

304
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,560
So to find change is difficult.
You keep this.

305
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,639
I want my 75 paise!

306
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,400
I don't have change that's
why the auto man was waiting here

307
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,879
I want my 75 paise.

308
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,760
I am an honest Police Officer.

309
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,919
How much money I gave
that much I take back.

310
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
I understand that but I don't
have change so you keep this.

311
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,679
That's your problem.

312
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,120
I really don't mind.
It's really okay with me.

313
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,880
Do you think I'm some
waiter or bearer that..

314
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,680
..you are giving me a tip
asking me to keep the change.

315
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,920
Funny person you are!
- Funny person?

316
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,360
Am I a funny person?
You called me funny?

317
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,399
You are getting me all wrong.

318
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,160
See you return my 75 paise.
I am asking for my money.

319
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Don't show me all big notes.
- It's not a big deal.

320
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,600
What do you think of yourself?

321
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,520
I am giving your money back.
- I am asking for my money.

322
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,800
Shut up, shut up.

323
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,760
You return my money. My 75 paise..

324
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,240
Okay, you wait here only,
keep quiet.

325
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,400
Go.

326
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,680
I am going.

327
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,120
Bring and come.

328
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,840
I'll give you your 75 paise!

329
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,440
See, don't let that man come inside.

330
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,560
You can't go inside.

331
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,320
Why? - Security reason.

332
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,600
Security reason.

333
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,120
I can stand on the road and scream,
can't I? - Your wish.

334
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,200
Thank you.

335
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,799
What is it?

336
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,360
What do you want?

00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,160
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

From when I am waiting!

340
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,279
Don't extend the issue!

341
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,240
Don't enter into a brawl!

342
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,440
Don't enter into a scuffle!

343
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,520

345
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,640
How can you go like this?

346
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,600
Remove the money quickly.

347
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,440
All the old people and
boys are looking at you.

348
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,640
Don't be coquettish.

349
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
Say something.

350
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,760
Tell me your decision.

351
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,640
Don't put up an act!

352
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,720
Don't enter into a brawl!

353
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,640
Don't enter into a scuffle!

354
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,800
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

355
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,000
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

356
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,720
Have seen many like you.

357
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,720
How do I trust you?

358
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,480
You are very clear

359
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,440
You are a smart girl.

360
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,880
Don't go upon getting angry.

361
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,880
Don't go after robbing me.

362
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,640
Give me my stuff.

363
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,840
Don't put up an act!

364
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,720
Don't enter into a brawl!

365
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,839
Don't enter into a scuffle!

366
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,880
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

367
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,240
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

368
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,240
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

369
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,160
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

370
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,800
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

371
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,000
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

372
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,840
Give three quarters!

373
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,000
What is this?

374
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,360
I love you.

375
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,360
She agreed.

376
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,240
Your doubt was right.
This is Janardhan's dog..

377
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,360
He has given the
information to police.

378
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,920
Please forgive, me Chiman Bhai.

379
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,400
See I told you, my brother
Janardhan is sitting in the jail..

380
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,840
..and doing a favour on me.

381
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,279
It is not only in your politics
that a double cross happens..

382
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,400
In our business too,
the same thing happens.

383
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,200
Munna, how is your boss?
How is his health inside the jail?

384
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,400
He's fine.

385
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,800
You are always in
a mood to kill people!

386
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,359
He is talking eye to eye.
That too with Chiman Bhai!

387
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,240
I will kill him.

388
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,160
Chiman bhai,
hand this job over to me.

389
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,520
When will your friendship
with the police be put to use?

390
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,240
Mother swear, I will finish
him off in an encounter.

391
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,480
By killing, the matter will
not improve, infact will get worse.

392
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,959
Chiman, see to increase
the enemity with Janardhan..

393
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,840
So what should I do,
send a box of sweetmeat to him?

394
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,200
According to my opinion,
talk to Janardhan once, if he..

395
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,360
..agrees that he is not going
to give us losses, then we will..

396
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,680
..forget what has happened.

397
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,800
I know that bastard's son very well.
Nothing will happen.

398
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,240
What's it?

399
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,400
See brother,
whatever happened, we must forget..

400
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,000
..and shake hands and compromise.

401
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,200
Tell Chiman that Janardhan
doesn't compromise with the enemy.

402
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,400
He removes him from the roots..

403
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,680
I knew it, I knew it!

404
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,920
That minister talks all rubbish!
I have been humiliated, haven't I?

405
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,520
..Chiman Bhai has sent
a man for compromise!

406
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,919
You fool.

407
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,319
One and a half hour has passed.
No consideration of time!

408
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,480
Just don't know how
such people do a police job?

409
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,800
Oh God!

410
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Let him come,
I will teach him such a lesson!

411
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,640
Oh God!

412
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,840
I don't believe this.

413
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,880
Vikram, today you are
going to get thrashed!

414
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,400
Sorry, I am one and half hour late.

415
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,920
I had to go to the
Commissioner with a file.

416
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,720
After that I went home,
had a bath and came here.

417
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,120
See, I didn't comb my hair even.
- It's okay.

418
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,320
It's okay.

419
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,960
I understand your
problems very well.

420
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,160
What's there if I had to
wait a little, its all right.

421
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,760
You understand?

422
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,800
Of course.

423
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,279
You are not angry at me?

424
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,680
I am not like those foolish
girls who get angry at..

425
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,400
..every small thing.

426
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,520
It's okay.

427
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,360
I don't believe it.

428
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,319
You are so nice,
see what I have brought for you.

429
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,320
That's so sweet!

430
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,560
Thanks.

431
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,720
Divya, do you know
the colour of this flower..

432
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,400
..is absolutely pale
in your comparison.

433
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Really? - Really!

434
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,360
You look very tired,
drink something.

435
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,960
Fell down.

436
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
I'll just make a phonecall
and come. - Fine.

437
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,880
Listen, the boy sitting there
has thrown a flower at me and..

438
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,400
..he is laughing too.

439
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,920
That boy? - Yes, see.

440
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Threw a flower? - Yes.

441
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,439
What's the matter?
Have you become too young?

442
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,360
Why are you teasing
other people's wives?

443
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,560
What happened, Sardarji?

444
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,120
What happened!? You threw
a flower at my wife or not?

445
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,840
I threw!? I just managed to avoid
a thrashing by my wife - to - be!

446
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,360
Where is your wife-to-be?

447
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,960
There she is.

448
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,479
Divya.

449
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,800
Divya.

450
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,240
Come I'll introduce her to you.

451
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,000
Tell these people
that you are with me.

452
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Divya. Divya, tell them.

453
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,000
Who are you?
I did not recognize you.

454
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,480
He says you are his wife - to - be!

455
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,720
Wife? Looks like he's gone crazy.

456
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,680
Divya, what are you saying?

457
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,480
Listen, you teach him
a lesson and break his bones.

458
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,360
My name is Mahinder
Singh Shera from Patiala.

459
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,799
I've been a Punjab
Wrestling Champion.

460
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,400
You teased my wife!?

461
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,160
Sardarji, see, don't move.

462
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,919
Try and understand. She is my wife.

463
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Don't do this! Try to understand!
- I won't spare you.

464
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,360
Divya, tell him.
He will hit me. Easy. - Stop.

465
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,160
Look, ask sister that I
had not thrown it at her!

466
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,600
Stop!

467
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,279
You are under oath of Patiala!
Don't come behind me.

468
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,760
Oh my God! - Divya, I will deal with you!
I won't spare you!

469
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,800
Run! - Stop!
Hey big Hooligan, escaped!

470
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,640
Punjab Kesari's wife, he is teasing!

471
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,800
What your wife!? I'll tease
your father, I'll tease your family!

472
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,400
Catch me if you can.

473
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,680
The heart is crazy!

474
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,000
The heart is crazy!

475
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,640
The heart is crazy!

476
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,799
The heart is crazy!

477
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,200
Wishes are flowing!
Weather is romantic!

478
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,680
Come in my arms, come, O come.

479
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,720
In your love! Like in the fights.

480
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,240
You have troubled me so much.

481
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,720
I was naïve and innocent.

482
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,160
You had not told me anything.

483
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,640
Just forget whatever
happened before.

484
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,160
Punish me as you wish.

485
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,720
Just see how ignorant he acts!

486
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,160
See how he is making me suffer.

487
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,600
The heart is crazy!

488
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,399
Wishes are flowing!
Weather is romantic!

489
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,759
Come in my arms, come, O come.

490
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,000
Come, I will take you in my arms.

491
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,400
You will never be angry, promise me!

492
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,920
Rob me from myself, O dear!

493
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,240
Write with your lips,
now this love story.

494
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,440
You are my flame, I am the kite.

495
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,640
The heart is crazy!

496
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,520
The heart is crazy!

497
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,440
Wishes are flowing!
Weather is romantic!

498
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,280
Come in my arms, come, O come.

499
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,760
Sir, your tea.

500
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,360
Someone gave this letter for you.

501
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,960
Weapons' Factory,
Null Bazar, 3rd Lane.

502
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,760
This is too much.

503
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,800
First cut that inspector
and put him in the well.

504
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,480
No, Chiman Bhai, we must
not put our hands on him now.

505
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,919
All of us can get stuck.
He is not alone.

506
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,799
Good thought in bad times
is to deal with Janardan first.

507
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,320
He must have given the
information to the police.

508
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,200
Chiman Bhai,
in my opinion, this matter.

509
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,400
No, I don't want your opinion, don't
even talk about your experience.

510
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,000
See Chiman Bhai, talk softly to me.

511
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,520
Now whatever has
to be done about this..

512
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,600
..we must discuss
it among ourselves.

513
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,120
See, see, this discussion and
solving problems by talking etc..

514
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,800
..it all takes place
in the Parliament.

515
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,440
Here, everything is instant!

516
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,319
He has given me a loss of crores.

517
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,360
Since so many days I am demanding
to finish off that Janardan!

518
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,759
Even a small connection
with this matter..

519
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,880
See this party problem is yours.
I supported you, not your party.

520
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,640
Fine, now what has to be done?

521
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,640
What has to be done?

522
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,360
Have to put some
of my men in the jail..

523
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,400
..and inside itself
we have to finish him off.

524
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,320
No, no, this method is
absolutely wrong, the matter..

525
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,800
..can get complicated,
your men can get caught in jail.

526
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,839
Chiman Bhai,
Bad Time, good thoughts.

527
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,400
Yes, you speak. I am fed
up with this political person!

528
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,800
Suppose we bring
Janardhan out of the jail?

529
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,279
I mean we convince the warden
to bring Janardan out..then?

530
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,640
This is good!

531
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,760
This is good!

532
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,560
What will happen?
Poor government officer will also..

533
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,600
..get some work.
He will get some money too.

534
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,279
Call both of them to the
Minister's farmhouse, to meet..

535
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
My farmhouse!?

536
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,840
Come on children, go.
Go and sit in the the bus.

537
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,920
Aarti, come back soon from picnic.
- Yes Brother.

538
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,480
Shall I leave? - Okay. Bye.

539
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,600
Bye. - Bye. - Bye.

540
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,720
Sister, I made fries for kids.
Just see how they are!

541
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,720
They are good.

542
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,320
Dear, did they like your fries?

543
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,320
They liked a lot,
you go quickly to the market and..

544
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,280
..bring the foodstuff. - Okay.

545
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,680
You take care of the children.
- Yes, yes

546
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,800
Oh my kite.

547
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,800
There it is. - I will
climb the trees and remove it.

548
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,640
Okay..fine.

549
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,400
Look Janardhan, Shah is dead now,
he cannot come back to life!

550
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,320
Then by continuing
with this enmity..

551
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,280
..and putting each other in losses,
what will we achieve?

552
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,480
Mr. Minister, Chiman had
killed Shah and broken my one leg.

553
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,280
Without compensating the damages,
I won't agree to any handshake!

554
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,800
Sir, please settle this matter
quickly. I have only one hour.

555
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,400
I have brought him here on the..

556
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,680
..pretext of taking
him to the hospital.

557
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,560
Jeevan. - Yes. - If anything goes wrong,
my job will be gone.

558
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,279
Janardhan Brother,
come here, come here in the shade.

559
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,560
He has taken a lot of
risk in fixing up this meeting.

560
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,120
Remove all the bitterness
from inside and drink this sweet.

561
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,160
You have tied the knot
of enmity so tight that to open..

562
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,440
..it now is impossible.

563
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,000
The game you have started with..

564
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,879
..Shah's murder I have
to bring it to an end.

565
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,560
What's happened, forget it.
Take care of what is left.

566
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,480
I will not forget it.

567
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,160
..Chiman Bhai would've gone back
to his native village as a pauper!?

568
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,800
I am not afraid of your threats!

569
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,600
What have you done, Chiman Bhai!?

570
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,319
Keep quiet, don't eat my brains!

571
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,440
I trusted you.
You killed him and got me trapped!

572
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,680
What was the use of killing him?

573
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,160
I am telling the truth, Chiman Bhai.

574
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,359
I will not spare you all.
I will hand you over to the police!

575
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,440
Listen Sharma, this way
the matter will become worse.

576
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,200
Whatever happened has happened.
Forget it.

577
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,880
How can I forget it?
How? - Leave me.

578
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,240
Hey Sharma,
you are not going anywhere.

579
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,280
No need to get so heated up. Some
solution for this will come out.

580
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,840
I have been told this
meeting is for discussions.

581
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,200
But you killed him.
Deceived me! You are killers!

582
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,800
Oh, this is the same minister
who comes to our school.

583
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,600
Minister has killed two people!
Two people he has killed!

584
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,880
They have identified me,
Chiman Bhai! Identified me!

585
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,600
Come come, we'll go and tell sister.

586
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,879
They ran away.

587
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,120
Chiman Bhai, do something.

588
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,879
They are children,
what will they say?

589
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,520
What children!?
They have recognized me.

590
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,400
I had gone to their school.

591
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,400
Two murders were
committed on my farmhouse!

592
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
Come.

593
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,360
Sister, one policeman
and one man have been murdered.

594
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,800
Yes sister, the minister
was also there, who had..

595
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,000
..come to our school
and given me a prize.

596
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,760
They have told their teacher also.

597
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,800
That Minister Jagat Narayan?
- Yes sister.

598
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,279
By tomorrow this news will
be spread in the city like fire.

599
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,480
My chair is gone.
Your lives will also be ruined.

600
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,759
This is no more restricted to kids.
They have told that girl too.

601
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,800
She will tell the police.

602
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,760
Sister, we are afraid.

603
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,800
Children, run! Run!

604
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,720
Hey Vilaiti, bring weapons.

605
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,840
Come inside. Come here.

606
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,279
Children, lie down, lie down.

607
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,400
Quick!

608
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,399
Lie down.

609
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,720
Quick!

610
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,480
Run!

611
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,960
Come on children, food is ready.

612
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,360
Who is this Anjali?

613
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,160
Hey Vilaiti, catch her.

614
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,280
Oh Chiman Bhai, she has
seen us killing the children.

615
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,920
If she tells them, then we will die,
we will get destroyed!

616
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,800
Oh, shut up.

617
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,680
Hello.

618
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:36,799
What?

619
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,440
Oh, my child.

620
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,320
My son!

621
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,759
I am badly stuck Chiman Bhai.

622
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,359
..to go there.

623
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,400
Anjali must have
met the police already.

624
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,919
What if she recognizes me?

625
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,240
The girl got a bullet in her leg,
right? If she is alive, she will..

626
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,920
..go to the City hospital,
won't she?

627
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,480
But, I don't want to go there.

628
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,400
No, no, you must not be afraid,
you are a Public Servant..

629
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,680
..people's sorrow you must share!

630
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,240
First make them cry
and then wipe the tears.

631
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,160
But, but, Chiman Bhai.

632
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,880
Put ifs and buts in some hole! Go
and see what the police are doing.

633
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,160
For the public keep a tear
in the eye and for the police..

634
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,839
..keep your ears open.
Go and be victorious! Go.

635
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,440
See minister sahib, our children
have been killed so mercilessly.

636
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,960
This accident has shaken everyone.

637
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,600
Even I am not less sorry.

638
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,520
Move back! Move back!

639
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,319
Mr. Minister, the court and the
law will not punish these killers.

640
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,520
We will mete out punishment to them.

641
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,800
They should get much more severe
punishment than simply getting hanged!

642
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,560
Any information, commissioner?

643
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,839
Any clue of those killers?

644
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,960
I want fast progress in this case.

645
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,960
The deftness with which
they have done this job..

646
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,800
..it seems they are
professional criminals.

647
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,720
And the most difficult
thing is that, sir..

648
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,439
..there is no eyewitness
to this incident.

649
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,680
Anjali!

650
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,160
Anjali! - Anjali!

651
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,360
Anjali!

652
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,680
Let me go!

653
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,120
Anjali! My daughter!

654
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,839
Let them come.

655
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,120
Let me go!

656
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,240
Let me go!

657
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,560
Sir, my daughter Anjali
was with these children.

658
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,440
Anjali. - Anjali.

659
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,360
Anjali. My child.

660
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,760
Listen to me. - Anjali.

661
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,920
Listen to me. - She is my child.

662
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,160
But who are you?

663
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,120
I'm the caretaker of the place where
these kids had come for a picnic.

664
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,560
My daughter had arranged
for their food, sir.

665
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,240
Listen..listen to me. Try to understand
what I am saying. - She was with them.

666
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,799
What was your daughter's age?

667
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,160
Twenty!

668
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
Twenty? - Yes.

669
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,560
No girl of this age
is among these. - What?

670
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,240
You keep patience, keep patience.

671
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,919
But why will they take that girl?

672
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,879
No such motive can be
seen behind this massacre!

673
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,160
It's possible,
that the girl has run away.

674
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:56,200
If it's like that, then that
girl can recognize those people.

675
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,200
My daughter is no where.

676
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,760
You just keep patience,
everything will be all right.

677
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,960
Your Anjali will be found. Can you
tell how does your daughter look?

678
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,440
There is no photograph,
but she is fair. Very good looking.

679
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,320
My lovely daughter is soft
like a flower. She is nowhere.

680
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,440
Everything will be all right.
Please sit there.

681
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,160
Ashok. - Sir.

682
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,560
Search the entire area.

683
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,480
She must be somewhere. Go.

684
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,400
Sharma. - Yes, sir.

685
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,120
Bring all the well known
hooligans to me. - Okay sir.

686
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,520
Listen, you were in Goa?

687
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,000
Yes sir.

688
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,160
When did you come to Bombay?
- Today morning, sir.

689
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,960
Close your button,
close your button.

690
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,600
Stand here.

691
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,400
I know that two among you..

692
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,440
The longer time you take..

693
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,240
..the bigger will be the
difficulty that you will face.

694
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,399
Tell me who killed
those innocent children?

695
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,800
Tell me or I will finish you off.

696
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,359
That officer,
how brave he is, even you know that.

697
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,760
In that shootout his
sister was also killed.

698
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,279
He can prove to be
very dangerous to us.

699
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,880
Yes and even her corpse
couldn't be found as yet.

700
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:10,759
What if she comes out alive?
Here our experiences are similar.

701
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,720
Tell me, what has to be done?

702
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,120
The trouble is, we can't get him
killed even. He is working on this..

703
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,960
..case is known to even
the children of this city.

704
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,680
If something happens to him..

705
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,640
..people will throw
me along with my chair too.

706
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,200
Oh yes, when will
Lokhande be of use to us?

707
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,960
Don't worry, your work will be done.

708
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,599
Those kids who don't
know Vikram as yet..

709
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,000
..will also come to
know of him by tomorrow.

710
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,880
A man of law should be
trapped by law only, right?

711
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,800
It will be done, Chiman Bhai.
It will be done.

712
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,880
Leave that to me.

713
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,120
Listen. - Yes.

714
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:09,639
In which lockup has Vikram
kept all those whom he had arrested?

715
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,880
Okay sir.

716
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
During interrogation,
who was there with Vikram?

717
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,280
None of us were there, sir.

718
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,400
Actually inspector Vikram
said that he did not require anyone.

719
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,400
He alone interrogated them.

720
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,760
Inspector, call the ambulance
and send the bodies for postmortem.

721
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,240
Sir.

722
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,799
Lokhande, take everyone's statement.
- Yes, sir.

723
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,880
I know you are innocent but
the way you have thrashed them!

724
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,560
Sir I..- Duty officers
are the witness to this.

725
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,600
Do you have any evidence
to save your skin?

726
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,920
Do you have any evidence?

727
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,800
Now it is more necessary to get
some evidence against those killers.

728
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,720
Only after they are caught,
can this conspiracy be busted.

729
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:43,320
My advice is,
don't invite any bigger trouble.

730
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,440
I am trying my best
to find Anjali out.

731
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,640
Understood it well?

732
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:05,400
Sir.

733
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,240
Our people are searching
that girl in the jungle? - Yes.

734
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,320
Hence check all the cars
properly before letting them pass.

735
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,280
Okay sir.

736
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,160
I want police..police!

737
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,679
I am the police. What happened?

738
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:55,640
I am Anjali,
they killed the children.

739
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,519
Killed them.

740
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,960
Who were they?

741
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,679
Do you know their names?

742
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,000
No.

743
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,720
If you see them,
will you recognize them? - Yes.

744
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,160
See Anjali, nothing will
happen to you, don't worry.

745
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,839
Come on. Get in.

746
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,920
Don't worry, don't worry, Anjali.
Everything will be all right.

747
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,720
Nothing will happen to you.

748
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:34,920
See the hospital has come,
try to remain conscious.

749
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:45,240
Try to remain conscious, try
to remain conscious. Listen to me.

750
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,960
Anjali!

751
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,400
Divya..

752
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,480
I know you are also
thinking wrong about..

753
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,400
I don't want to listen to anything
nor do I want to say anything.

754
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,760
Oh God who has come!
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

755
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,800
Dingdong, sing a song.

756
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,800
Dingdong, sing a song.

757
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,920
We got scared? Come and face us.

758
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,800
Dingdong, sing a song.

759
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,400
Dance! Laugh! Smile!

760
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,920
This is the occasion, enjoy!

761
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,400
Dingdong, sing a song.

762
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,839
Dance! Laugh! Smile!

763
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,879
This is the occasion, enjoy!

764
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,680
Watch this.

765
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,000
In the lanes and roads,
in the arms of fun.

766
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,120
In the lanes and roads,
in the arms of fun.

767
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,840
We will dance and sing,
we crazy people.

768
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,200
In the fair of colors or all alone.

769
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,960
This world will
watch us in amazement!

770
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,960
Everyone loves us.

771
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,440
It is better than both the world.

772
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,800
Our heart is still innocent.

773
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,000
There is no one like us.

774
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,440
Dingdong, sing a song.

775
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,480
Dingdong, sing a song.

776
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,960
Dance! Laugh! Smile!

777
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,120
This is the occasion, enjoy!

778
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,519
Hey you!

779
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,160
Whatever we wish to do,
we will do and show it to the world!

780
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,960
Be it a heroine or a hero!
They all appear to us as zeros!

781
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,800
Be it a leader or a hero!
They all appear to us as zeros!

782
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,360
This is our world! This is our song!

783
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:56,200
We dream for a golden tomorrow,
that is ours.

784
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,240
We will walk on swords.

785
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,719
We will walk on fire.

786
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,160
But we will not
break this friendship.

787
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,280
We will not leave each others' side.

788
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,320
The whole world will see this.

789
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,960
Dingdong, sing a song.

790
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,679
Dingdong, sing a song.

791
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,400
Dance! Laugh! Smile!

792
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,360
This is the occasion, enjoy!

793
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,840
Dingdong, sing a song.

794
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,520
Dance! Laugh! Smile!

795
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,640
This is the occasion, enjoy!

796
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,320
Dance! Laugh! Smile!

797
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,160
Vikram.

798
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,519
..this place is no good.

799
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,440
Hey, why are you creating a ruckus?

800
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,240
Listen. - Yes sir.

801
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,120
Stand straight. - Yes sir.

802
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:41,400
Sir, why have you called me here?

803
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:48,880
All this was happening
with you and I was helpless.

804
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,760
I was surrounded by
the boundaries of the law.

805
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,560
But now I want to come
out of the boundaries and fight.

806
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,920
I have only one goal.

807
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,360
Sir, did you get any
information about them?

808
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,000
The caretaker's daughter
whom we were searching for..

809
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,480
..I found her in an injured state.

810
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,760
Our doubt was right.

811
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,400
She had seen children
being killed with her eyes.

812
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,599
She could recognize the killers.

813
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,880
And due to that fear,
they fired at her too.

814
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,800
May I meet her once, sir?

815
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,600
I will kill those rogues, sir.
I will literally kill..

816
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,520
That girl is dead.

817
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,519
Anjali died?

818
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,600
Anjali died..she died! - Vikram.

819
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,560
Sorry sir.

820
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,400
Vikram, I have thought of a plan.

821
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,400
That Anjali is dead is known to me..

822
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,640
..Anjali's parents and now to you.

823
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,880
Anjali is still a
threat to those killers.

824
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,919
They're still in her search.

825
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,840
That's why we will
keep Anjali alive.

826
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:34,000
And we will spread the news
that the police have found her.

827
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,480
Has the Commissioner sir
explained everything to you?

828
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,160
Yes.

829
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,680
What have you thought?

830
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,840
What is there to think in this?
I am ready.

831
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,880
Divya, you know this is
a very dangerous work. - I know.

832
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,320
Your life may also go in this.
- I know.

833
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,000
I have no fear.

834
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,919
I am now at Anjali's place.

835
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,920
Saw, that girl is gone
in the hands of the police?

836
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,360
As soon as she regains
consciousness, she'll tell everything.

837
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,480
That is true!

838
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,600
If the operation is
done and she'll surely..

839
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,480
..regain her consciousness.
Then she will surely open her..

840
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,400
..mouth and if she opens
her mouth we are finished.

841
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,400
To kill that girl in the
hospital is not an easy job.

842
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,840
What do you think to kill
her will I send my own men?

843
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,800
Will I make such a mistake.

844
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,679
The minister do this work?

845
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,480
Me?

846
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,120
Come I will explain to you, come.

847
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,320
You can go to see her.
You are the minister.

848
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,440
She is your subject.

849
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,720
With a goodwill gesture
our job will also be done.

850
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,559
Sir, come. Please come.

851
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,879
Constable, accompany him.

852
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,240
I want to go to the bathroom,
please check it. - Yes.

853
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,840
Go outside!
- What happened? - Go outside.

854
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:02,920
Sir.

855
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,120
What's the position?

856
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,120
Arrangements for the
operations have been made.

857
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,559
Senior Dr.
Patel is just going to come here.

858
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,760
As soon as he comes, Anjali will
be taken to the operation theatre.

859
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,800
Yes, sir. Definitely.

860
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,640
Friends..

861
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:39,160
..you all know that Anjali's life..
how important it is for us.

862
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:45,400
To know about those killers, she
is the only witness that we have.

863
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,760
This news must've
reached them as well.

864
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,960
And they must also
be trying to kill her..

865
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,160
See, there should be no
laxity in the security here.

866
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:06,480
She's the only one who
can help us reach those killers.

867
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,800
Hey, stop!

868
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:31,800
If my foot moves from this pedal,
this girl will die for sure.

869
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,800
All others will also die.
- No..no.

870
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,639
Move out of my way. - Yes, Yes.

871
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,760
Move back, move.

872
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,360
As soon as she is
conscious inform me.

873
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,200
She should give her
statement in front of me.

874
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,800
Yes sir.

875
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,480
I have put a bomb on this girl.

876
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,320
Tell your police officers
to move out of my way.

877
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,200
Go back, everyone go back,
everyone go back.

878
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,960
Sir, please.

879
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:21,160
Go back.

880
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,839
Sir, please listen
to me and go from here.

881
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,200
Please sir, I request you.

882
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,240
I am requesting you to go from here.

883
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,200
Please, please, I request you.

884
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,840
You people be with him.

885
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:53,880
Hey!

886
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,000
I am telling you the
whole hospital will blast.

887
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:00,800
You all will die, this girl,
this Anjali will also get killed.

888
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,120
If my foot is lifted from
this pedal, the bomb will blast.

889
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,840
In one way it has been
good and if has been bad too.

890
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,559
What good has happened?

891
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,560
That inspector searching for
killers of his sister and children.

892
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,560
That means he's looking for us

893
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,280
..and now they have that girl who
recognizes us. What's good in that?

894
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:21,719
See Mr. Jagat Narayan, the
police knows means the public knows.

895
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,360
Police we can handle,
public we cannot.

896
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,600
Now he has become
an enemy to the law.

897
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,760
Now he will try to
fight with us alone or not?

898
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:36,280
See Chiman Bhai, what use is
it to wait for the enemy to attack?

899
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:41,600
Spread your net all over
the city and kill both of them.

900
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:44,920
Yes, this is what I am
saying from the beginning.

901
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:48,240
And at such times you too
take advantage of your chair.

902
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:53,760
Call the Commissioner and tell him
to give you every report of Vikram..

903
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,400
As soon as we get
a hint of his hideout..

904
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,560
..we will reach there before
the police and will finish him off.

905
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,280
Now go and make the phone call.

906
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,559
Hello Commissioner,
I am Jagat Narayan speaking.

907
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,679
What is your police doing?

908
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,280
Why have you not found out
anything about Vikram and that girl?

909
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:20,440
Sir, we are trying to
trace them out. Do not worry.

910
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,120
What? Such a big incident
has taken place and..

911
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,200
..you are telling me not to worry.

912
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,480
Do you have any idea that how..

913
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,160
..much anger is there
in people's heart?

914
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:35,280
See the arrest of that inspector
and the safety of that girl.

915
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,960
I want the report of all
your progress about these matters.

916
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,400
For my selfish reasons..

917
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,360
Nothing will happen to you.

918
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,920
Divya, I love you.

919
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,280
I love you.

920
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,560
I will not let
anything happen to you.

921
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,719
Divya, I love you. I love you.

922
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:33,799
Sweetheart,
come I will give you love.

923
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:42,320
Sweetheart,
come I will give you love.

924
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:52,960
I'll keep you in my heart and
love you only! Give my life for you.

925
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:20,240
Sweetheart,
come I will give you love.

926
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:12,440
I have become a madcap!
- Don't love me so much!

927
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:24,760
Look in my eyes!
- So much love is hidden!

928
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:32,440
I have become a madcap!
- Don't love me so much!

929
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:35,520
Come I will take you in my arm..

930
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:40,640
..play with your lips
and make up your tresses!

931
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:45,960
My love, your image
is more loving than God.

932
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:56,520
Sweetheart,
come I will give you love.

933
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:48,000
Now the shades are same.
- Of our dreams.

934
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:09,440
Now the shades are same.
- Of our dreams.

935
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:25,280
My love, this life of mine,
this heartbeat is your sign.

936
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:33,719
Sweetheart, on my lips
is only your tale, all the time.

937
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:40,960
Sweetheart,
come I will give you love.

938
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:48,760
Sweetheart,
come I will give you love.

939
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:59,960
Keep you in my heart and
love you only. Give my life for you.

940
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,440
Our this plan has forced
them to take this step..

941
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,400
..but they are cunning and clever.

942
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,759
Sir, this shows their fear.

943
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,519
Don't know whether they
will commit the mistake of..

944
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,560
..coming out in the open or not!

945
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,880
Since fear in them will
make them commit a mistake.

946
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:55,000
And their mistake
will be our victory.

947
01:42:56,240 --> 01:43:01,200
Now they must know our address
so that they try to kill us.

948
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,719
For that I must go to joints
where illegal trade is carried out.

949
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:10,000
Like red - light areas,
liquor joints, gambling dens, etc.

950
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,800
Since they usually
frequent these areas..

951
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:18,480
..if anyone spots
me our work will be done.

952
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:45,280
Divya..

953
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,519
..nothing can happen!

954
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,679
Nothing.

955
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,400
Everything was planned properly.

956
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,800
Even put your life in
danger but nothing happened.

957
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,240
We thought that we will
take you out from the hospital..

958
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,719
..so that they will
follow and attack us..

959
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,120
..that they will try to kill us,
but nothing happened.

960
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,760
Until they take any
action what can we do?

961
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,760
Vikram, you cannot
torture yourself like this.

962
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,240
What can I do? What can I do?

963
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,320
Those small kids were my friends.

964
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,240
I used to play with them.

965
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,360
My sister used to teach them.

966
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:16,160
Hello.

967
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:22,000
Listen Lokhande, my boys have found
out the place where they both are.

968
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:26,360
Take your men and finish them off.

969
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,559
What happened?

970
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,000
Everything will be fine.

971
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:23,160
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

972
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:33,120
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

973
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:39,440
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

974
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:46,519
"All vows break at such a time."

975
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:51,960
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

976
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:05,799
"The marvel of the
lovely night is torturous."

977
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:11,280
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

978
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:18,599
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

979
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:57,400
"My breaths are hot."

980
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:00,160
"Make an attempt."

981
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:03,840
"Eyes are mischievous."

982
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,800
"My body is smoldering."

983
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:13,480
"My breaths are hot."

984
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:16,160
"Make an attempt."

985
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:19,760
"Eyes are mischievous."

986
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,880
"Wonder what intoxication is this."

987
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:26,800
"Let us err."

988
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:29,559
"Wonder what intoxication is this."

989
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:32,440
"Let us err."

990
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:39,400
"I think this fervor won't ebb."

991
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,880
"I am lonely, beloved."

992
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,680
"You are also lonely, beloved."

993
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:51,920
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

994
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,480
Hello.

995
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:13,560
Listen Lokhande, my boys have found
out the place where they both are.

996
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:17,720
Take your men and finish them off.

997
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,320
"My beloved."

998
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,200
"Take me in your arms."

999
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:39,960
"What desires are these!"

1000
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,639
"Play with danger."

1001
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:49,640
"My beloved."

1002
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,960
"What desires are these!"

1003
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:59,560
"Play with danger."

1004
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,720
"Tease me a little."

1005
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,720
"Relish the youth."

1006
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:09,360
"Tease me a little."

1007
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,200
"Relish the youth."

1008
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:18,560
"Have a close look.
Don't be heartless."

1009
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:24,440
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

1010
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:30,880
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

1011
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:38,360
"The marvel of the
lovely night is torturous."

1012
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:43,799
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

1013
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:50,240
"I am lonely, beloved.
You are also lonely, beloved."

1014
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,440
This..why has this
police come here?

1015
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:36,800
Vikram ,come out in the open!

1016
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:39,800
Fast..

1017
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,280
..or else I'll shoot this girl.

1018
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,320
Come on. Fast.

1019
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:51,160
On whose action do you want
to kill us? Who has sent you?

1020
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:57,480
Police wants Anjali alive,
then why did you shoot?

1021
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:03,280
Speak up. Who wants us dead?
Who wants us dead?

1022
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,680
Speak up.

1023
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,760
Even if you lose your
consciousness a 100 times, still..

1024
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:18,400
..I will bring you back into
consciousness and will ask you..

1025
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:22,280
..only one question,
who wants us dead? Speak up!

1026
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:48,599
Lokhande,
death is here also and there too.

1027
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:52,719
Better commit suicide.

1028
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:54,960
Jump from the window.

1029
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:06,240
Leave me Vikram. - No.

1030
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:07,559
Who were they?

1031
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:13,440
Let me die.
- Tell me, who were they?

1032
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:14,440
Tell me.

1033
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,200
No! No!

1034
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:18,800
No! No!

1035
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:38,560
With great difficulty we
found one man and he also died.

1036
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:43,320
Now don't know rest of them will
come in front of us or not. - Vikram.

1037
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:46,400
Vikram, please. Please.

1038
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,360
Lokhande is killed.

1039
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:54,800
What is happening, Commissioner?

1040
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,719
Only for one Vikram,
your police force is falling short?

1041
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:01,280
Lokhande didn't give me any
information about this operation.

1042
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,799
You are the Police
Commissioner of this city.

1043
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:05,760
And you are not in
the know of anything!?

1044
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:10,000
In the hospital, under your
security Vikram took away Anjali.

1045
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,720
Today he killed Lokhande.
Tomorrow he will kill me.

1046
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:20,480
Do anything.

1047
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:22,840
Deploy your men all over the city..

1048
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,960
.and kill them wherever
they are spotted.

1049
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,760
But we want Anjali alive, sir?

1050
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:32,760
Yes, yes,
when will we get her alive?

1051
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,800
We are trying our level best.

1052
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:47,200
First of all the minister
knew Lokhande very well.

1053
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,280
When he saw Lokhande's
body he was afraid..

1054
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:54,800
..as if his own life was in danger.

1055
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:58,800
Afterwards, in nervousness he
threatened to kill Anjali and you.

1056
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:03,120
One minute, when in the
hospital they tried to kill Divya.

1057
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:12,280
That means, that the minister is
also involved with those killers..

1058
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:16,840
..and he had sent
Lokhande to kill us.

1059
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,320
Sir, Divya is correct.

1060
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,480
This minister is also
one among those killers.

1061
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,600
We've to do something immediately..

1062
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:26,320
..otherwise they will
find many avenues to escape.

1063
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:31,440
This time we cannot do
anything against the minister.

1064
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:34,240
Because we don't have any evidence.

1065
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,320
And we know one thing
that there are other people..

1066
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,559
..who are involved in the massacre.

1067
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:46,200
And the minister
is the way to reach him.

1068
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:52,320
And now we have to think
as to how to use this minister.

1069
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,120
Sir, we will one thing.

1070
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,280
Hi.

1071
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,920
Sorry minister,
I disturbed you in this place.

1072
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,000
Help!

1073
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,760
Someone help! Police!

1074
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:45,520
No..no..

1075
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:48,520
You bastard,
you have killed those children.

1076
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,960
Let go of me, leave me, you bastard.

1077
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,520
Sir, you don't know, he is the man..

1078
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:01,800
..who had killed
those innocent children.

1079
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:04,880
See, the crime has to be
decided by the law and the court.

1080
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:05,560
Take him away.

1081
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:08,520
Yes. Take me. You can't harm me.

1082
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:15,120
I won't spare this man
and his accomplices. I won't.

1083
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:17,400
I won't spare them.

1084
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:35,640
Sir, fear and the color
of your face shows me..

1085
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,640
..that what Vikram
says is the truth.

1086
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,480
And the trouble in which
this truth can put you and..

1087
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:47,120
..and your accomplices
is very well known to you.

1088
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:55,360
For you and all your accomplices..

1089
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,960
..if you want..

1090
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:04,320
..I have a solution
to come out of this problem.

1091
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,400
How much money do you want?
10 lakhs, 20 lakhs?

1092
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:15,360
50 lakhs!
I want 50 lakhs for this work.

1093
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:17,639
I agree for this amount..

1094
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,360
..but give us Anjali's information
and hand her over to us..

1095
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,400
..and also that Vikram..

1096
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,519
I will kill him
in the lockup itself.

1097
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:26,880
I understood.

1098
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,720
But Vikram will not disclose
about Anjali easily.

1099
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,400
He'll definitely tell. Just watch.

1100
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:43,240
Speak up, where is Anjali?
- I won't tell.

1101
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,720
Tell us, where is the girl,
inspector Vikram.

1102
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,759
By being silent why do
you want to give away your life?

1103
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:56,880
Tell us about that girl.

1104
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:00,680
I will not die.

1105
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:07,400
My life will not go so easily.

1106
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:10,840
Before dying..

1107
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:14,520
..I want to do some good work.

1108
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:19,320
Very tough!

1109
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:23,400
When he regains consciousness,
thrash him again.

1110
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,360
Then only will he
tell where the girl is.

1111
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:50,680
I am saying it again.

1112
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,400
This was the girl
who was in the hospital.

1113
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,920
One minute..one minute.
You mean to say that the girl..

1114
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,280
This can happen,
what's a big deal in it?

1115
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:08,800
I can't understand that for the girl
for whom Vikram is being thrashed..

1116
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,440
..the same girl comes
to meet Vikram in the lockup!

1117
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:12,760
Why are you pressurizing your mind?

1118
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:14,920
Oh, you confused me too!

1119
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,599
We'll go point by point.

1120
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,360
When Vikram attacked you,
who came to save you?

1121
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,560
Commissioner.

1122
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:24,680
How did he come to know that
Vikram was going to attack you?

1123
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:29,440
Means Commissioner knew that
Vikram was going to attack you.

1124
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:35,839
Who will come to know such secrets?

1125
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,880
But how did you come to know?

1126
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:42,480
You know when Commissioner
saved you, it struck in my mind.

1127
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:44,760
I asked two men to follow him.

1128
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,720
As the commissioner
will meet the girl..

1129
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,720
..and this will
be known to my men to.

1130
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,600
Then we would pick
up the girl. Simple!

1131
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:04,480
Hello.

1132
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,280
Commissioner, uncle.
- What happened to you?

1133
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:07,720
Commissioner, uncle.

1134
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:09,440
Divya.

1135
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:10,760
Come on.

1136
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,480
Hello.

1137
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:25,280
Divya.

1138
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:27,120
Divya.

1139
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:34,280
Hello.

1140
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:38,560
So commissioner, got bowled over?

1141
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:42,120
This happens when you play a game!

1142
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,800
Who are you? - If you want
the girl alive, do one thing.

1143
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,920
My man is there beside you.

1144
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:56,120
Catch hold of his finger
and come wherever he brings you.

1145
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,000
If anything happens to that girl..

1146
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:08,200
You come here and we'll clear
everything sitting face to face.

1147
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:10,280
Come here and we'll settle. Bye.

1148
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:12,400
Moron.

1149
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,719
Smile now.

1150
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,519
The girl is also reached there and
I spoke to the Commissioner as well.

1151
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:25,520
This colorful program shall
be at your farmhouse only.

1152
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:30,800
But..- No ifs and buts!

1153
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:32,000
Do only what I ask you to do.

1154
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,840
Nothing can be said
about you people.

1155
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,560
If things go out of hand,
you will give a letter of consent.

1156
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,720
You'll change your party.

1157
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:41,920
The main issue is left.

1158
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:45,639
The doctor which operated on..

1159
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,520
..the girl, we've to call him too.

1160
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,440
And the parents of that girl.

1161
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,680
We have to call them as well.

1162
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:58,120
Brother, my work is over. Killing
Vikram in the jail is your duty.

1163
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,200
Who sent you?

1164
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:16,679
Who sent you?

1165
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,679
Jagat Narayan and Chimanbhai.

1166
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,800
Come. Come.

1167
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:01,120
He is the real man!

1168
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,800
Come. Come.

1169
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:10,160
What a game!

1170
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:12,320
What a game he has played.

1171
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:14,000
Isn't it?

1172
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,960
And we thought we
are the only bastards.

1173
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:27,360
But, you, a gentleman, how
did you thought of all this? Great!

1174
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:30,760
Had you been in our gang,
you would've reached places.

1175
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,639
When he didn't use the law,
he used the brain!

1176
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,440
You shot at her!

1177
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:24,320
He played a great trick!

1178
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:29,360
That girl was dead, still he
spread the rumor that she is alive.

1179
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:32,920
So that we have to
come out to finish her off.

1180
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:59,600
Secondly, when the minister
went to kill her in the hospital..

1181
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:03,400
..you shifted her from the hospital,
with Vikram's help.

1182
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:09,840
I can't understand from where
to start breaking your bones!

1183
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:44,320
But one salute is
due to this baby too..

1184
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,920
..that she was ready to receive
bullets upon the commissioner..

1185
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,320
..asking her to do so!

1186
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,520
So all this drama
was to reach us, right?

1187
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:07,840
They wanted to meet
the killers of the children.

1188
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:12,680
Now your wish is fulfilled, right?
You have seen me, right?

1189
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:14,640
All this was done by me.

1190
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:21,640
Everything was done by me.
And this minister too.

1191
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:28,720
He was helpless as he
wanted to save his prestige.

1192
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:35,480
Her sister-in-law, Vikram's
sister, we had to kill her as well.

1193
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,880
And that fellow..
your honest inspector..

1194
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:46,400
..we got him trapped,
got his suspended too..

1195
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:47,600
..but did he reform his ways?

1196
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,120
Finally we got him
killed in the jail!

1197
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,400
What?

1198
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:58,480
So what else could I do?
Even I was staring at the gallows!

1199
02:13:58,760 --> 02:13:59,760
I too was helpless.

1200
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:04,920
But now everything is clear!
Everything is clear.

1201
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,520
..all the accessories are here only.

1202
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:11,520
I'll just see.

1203
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:19,880
One by one, I'll tackle them!

1204
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:43,800
Give that to me.

1205
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:45,720
Throw away your weapons. Move back!

1206
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,520
You are a bastard..

1207
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:50,520
..that was known to me.

1208
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:55,160
But you will reach
such limits of bestiality..

1209
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:58,240
..was not known to me.

1210
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:08,480
Didn't your hands shiver
committing such a heinous crime?

1211
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:12,400
If not the police and the law..

1212
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:16,720
..you should've been scared
of that God, the Almighty!

1213
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:54,120
This is Jagat Narayan speaking.

1214
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:56,800
Send a helicopter at my farm house,
immediately.

1215
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:02,320
Ran away!

1216
02:18:07,719 --> 02:18:08,639
Let go of me!

1217
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:10,920
Leave me.

1218
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:12,439
Get inside.

1219
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:13,600
Leave me.

1220
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:16,120
Where are you taking me?
- Sit quietly.

1221
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:20,390
What are you doing?
- What happened?

1222
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:21,440
You know who that guy is?

1223
02:18:21,639 --> 02:18:23,760
He is the man who killed
hundreds of children!

1224
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:25,520
And you are helping him!?

1225
02:18:25,799 --> 02:18:28,359
What are you saying?
- I am speaking the truth.

1226
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,160
I won't partake in this sin.

1227
02:18:34,959 --> 02:18:36,959
One who takes the name
of the Lord is benefited!

1228
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:39,480
He is going there..there.

1229
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,160
Down..down!

1230
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:13,520
Faster!

1231
02:19:23,559 --> 02:19:24,680
Further!

1232
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,160
Help! Help!

1233
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:34,680
Behind that car!

1234
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:41,840
There he is..there.

1235
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:48,519
Faster!

1236
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,400
No..no!

1237
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:00,480
Hurry up!

1238
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:10,920
Leave me.

1239
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,760
Leave it!

1240
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:20,800
No.

1241
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:23,320
Faster!

1242
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:42,720
That car is going towards the ditch.

1243
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:48,160
Divya, jump! Jump!

1244
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:50,320
Vikram..help!

1245
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:53,840
Help!

1246
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:57,160
Come on top!

1247
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:05,560
Give me your hand, Divya!

1248
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:10,680
Give me your hand!

1249
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:14,800
Yes, Divya! - Vikram..

1250
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:16,360
Vikram.

1251
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:23,679
Up.

1252
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,320
Vikram. - Come on.

1253
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:47,800
Help!

1254
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:12,919
There he is..
running with the car. Look there.

1255
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,880
Down..

1256
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:28,160
..there that blue car..look!

1257
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:41,920
Help!

1258
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,400
He is thrashing him!

1259
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:45,000
He is thrashing him!

1260
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:52,600
He is thrashing him!

1261
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:57,390
Leave me..
let go of me! Let go of me

1262
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:10,880
Stop him! Stop him!

1263
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:12,919
Stop him! Stop him!

1264
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Take him Take him

1265
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:20,240
Leave me! Leave me!

1266
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:21,520
He is the person who.

1267
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:24,800
..killed those hundred kids.
He is the person!

1268
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,480
Catch him! Catch him!

1269
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:59,920
It's mine! It's mine!

1270
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:06,800
Help! Help!

1271
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:08,480

My son, you aren't hurt, are you?

1280
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,800
Come on. Come on.

1281
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:21,720
Perhaps God too couldn't think of
any other punishment for your sins.

1282
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:26,480
What punishment has God given you,
seeing your crime!

1283
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:30,840
O God!

1284
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:33,000
Your justice is great!

1285
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:54,720
You all right? - Yes.

1286
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:58,119
Divya, I want to
talk to you something.

1287
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:02,760
I need my 75 paise!

1288
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:06,640
75 paise? - Yes.

1289
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:10,680
Even now I don't have the change!

1290
02:28:13,880 --> 02:28:17,720
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

1291
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:22,000
Give three quarters!
Give three quarters! 75 paise!

1292
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:27,760
From when I am waiting!

1293
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:31,439
Don't show your eyes!
