1
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,925
Your eyes...

2
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,332
my eyes

3
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,935
Your forehead...

4
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,934
your nose

5
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,944
Your lips

6
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,645
My heart, your brains

7
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,350
No... not your brains.
You´re a duffer

8
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,719
All right. Your heart.
And your brains. Okay?

9
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,995
Listen...
What?

10
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,335
What will we name our son?
Son?

11
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,663
No son, l want a daughter.
Why?

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,008
Just like you

13
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,012
But l want sons
after that, okay?

14
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:25,045
Want to know how many?
Let´s settle for a dozen

15
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,046
Twelve!

16
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,061
My companion...

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,401
my love...

18
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:52,778
for the first time,
my eyes see Spring like this

19
00:01:53,547 --> 00:02:01,113
What spell does
the lovely weather cast...?

20
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,580
you have stolen my heart,
my love

21
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:18,729
For the first time,
my eyes see Spring like this

22
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:26,842
What spell does
the lovely weather cast...?

23
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:31,779
you have stolen my heart,
my love

24
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,062
l was thirsty at heart...

25
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:26,462
and l drank the sea
in a single gulp

26
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,304
ln just a matter of moments...

27
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,305
in just a day or two...

28
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:40,047
l have lived the lifetime
of a hundred years

29
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:47,451
This is the first time l see
life so clearly...

30
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,853
the lovely weather,
this moment of ecstasy...

31
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,724
what spell has the
weather cast on me?

32
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,533
You have stolen my heart, my love

33
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,887
Maya...

34
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,237
What happened, Maya?

35
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,408
l´m afraid...
what if something happens to you?

36
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,440
To me...? Silly girl.
What´s going to happen to me?

37
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,111
No power on earth
can separate us

38
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:53,453
Roses, l saw blossoming...

39
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:59,457
but even thorns blossom today

40
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:06,469
People, l saw meeting...

41
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:12,469
l see the earth and the skies
meeting today

42
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:20,175
For the first time,
l have begun to trust my life...

43
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:25,190
This lovely weather,
this ecstatic moment...

44
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,186
what spell has the
weather cast...?

45
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,930
You have stolen my heart, my love

46
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:46,034
For the first time,
my eyes see Spring like this

47
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:54,252
What spell does
the lovely weather cast...?

48
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,847
you have stolen my heart,
my love

49
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,660
This is Dr Akash Bhatnagar.
My wife is trapped in the floods

50
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,199
lt´s your duty to...
We can´t do anything about it

51
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,941
We really don´t have
any transport

52
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,176
There are landslides everywhere
out there

53
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,105
But you can surely do something!

54
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,373
My wife is a doctor and she has
herself volunteered. lt´s your duty...

55
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,449
l know all that, sir.
But we don´t have any transport

56
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,722
l´ve heard it all!
Please don´t keep repeating it

57
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,387
Our soldiers are posted there, sir

58
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,718
There must be a phone there surely?

59
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,441
Where are you?
l´m worried sick looking for you

60
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,045
Neither do l know where l am

61
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,787
l´m some 40 kilometers away
from the base camp

62
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,655
Are you all right?
Nothing´s happened to you, l hope?

63
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,924
l want to come there
to bring you back, Maya

64
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,792
Don´t come here, Akki.
We´re getting out of here

65
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,434
l want to see you

66
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,836
Don´t l want to see you too?
l´m coming over

67
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,809
Come soon, Maya

68
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,507
l´m scared...
what if something happens?

69
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,442
Nothing will happen
to me, Akki!

70
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,581
The locket of Lord Ganesha
you gave me...

71
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,516
on our first anniversary,
is still with me

72
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,852
Nothing will happen to me, Akki

73
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,193
Nothing´s going to
happen to me

74
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,444
Maya Bhatnagar wasn´t just a doctor.
She was God´s gift to society

75
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,218
She didn´t treat medical practice
like a profession, it was her religion

76
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,054
Each one of us here works
to gain something

77
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,057
But Maya always wanted to give,
she wished to serve

78
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,729
She never treated her little patients
any less than her own children

79
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,708
People had started believing that
Maya possessed some divine talent

80
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,605
More than medicines, Maya has
cured several patients...

81
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,785
with her love and care

82
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:25,119
We know, no one in the hospital
will be able to take her place

83
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:30,522
The loss of Maya we shall
feel forever

84
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,572
There was no doubt that the
accident in which Maya died...

85
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,841
was so horrible, that no one
could have survived it

86
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,544
l wonder how Maya
must have died

87
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,181
They say, you can say from the
face of the dead...

88
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,523
whether they´ve had a peaceful
death, or a horrible one

89
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,857
lt had become very necessary for me
to see Maya´s face

90
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,204
Finish your enquiry
as fast as possible

91
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,904
lt´s raining heavily,
it could get worse

92
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,506
We won´t be able to
get out of here, sir

93
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,238
You said it was 80 kilometers.
This is 1 10 kilometers extra

94
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,741
How much money are
you going to spend?

95
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,657
Here we are, sir

96
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,054
Hurry up, sir!
lt´s pouring heavily

97
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,257
l´m willing wait here for some
more time, Officer. Please!

98
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,695
lt´s raining so heavily, we don´t
know where whose body has gone

99
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,267
l advise you to return.
l´m staying here

100
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,265
l´m staying here till
your operation is over

101
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,277
Believe me, sir.
The operation is over

102
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,053
Deep down in my heart, l probably
wished that we didn´t find Maya´s body

103
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:06,052
Because in that wish of mine,
was hidden a hope

104
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,658
The hope of Maya being alive

105
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,126
l can´t say about others,
but that was the hope l lived on

106
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,971
Victims of the accident that took place
this morning have been admitted

107
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,871
How many of them?
6 have arrived...

108
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,411
6 of them have yet to be admitted

109
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,276
She was in that bus too, doctor

110
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,179
Take her to the O.T. immediately
and prepare for an operation

111
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,724
Doctor, this patient has 80º/.º/. burns...
Take him to the burns ward. Quick!

112
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,727
Anymore casualties?
Not as yet

113
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,796
This girl tried to commit suicide.
lf there was anymore delay, maybe...

114
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,837
Let Dr Mehta handle this case

115
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,178
But Dr Mehta´s handling
the pregnancy case

116
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,448
lf you could attend to this one...
Now look, nurse

117
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,684
l am the who decides
who handles which case

118
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,444
l don´t want to see patients who
themselves don´t wish to live

119
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,449
Ask Dr Mehta to handle the case.
Tell him those are my instructions

120
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,269
Chances of survival if
the pregnancy is terminated?

121
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,730
Difficult, sir

122
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,304
We need to do something

123
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,509
We need permission to
terminate the pregnancy

124
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,510
We don´t need it for
the delivery, do we?

125
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,971
What do you think?
Was that the right decision you made?

126
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,668
l think it was right.
To do an abortion on a woman...

127
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,914
6 months pregnant, a caesarean!
That too, without her permission!

128
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,846
The woman was unconscious. lt was not
possible to save both of them

129
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,181
l couldn´t save the mother,
but l somehow saved the baby

130
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,592
You refused to handle
that suicide case too

131
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,161
l entrusted it to Dr. Mehta.
Why?

132
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,602
Because you thought that patient
wasn´t worthy of you?

133
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,006
Can we talk about this
tomorrow?

134
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,977
Ever since Maya has died...

135
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,308
you´ve been working round the clock
for the last seven days

136
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,717
That hasn´t affected my efficiency

137
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,213
ln fact, your efficiency
has received a great boost

138
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,662
My hospital does not need
so much of efficiency

139
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,658
The rest of my staff can´t take it

140
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,663
The staff also complain that you have
become very irritable of late

141
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,040
l think you need to rest

142
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:19,248
After Maya´s death, maybe you
haven´t still cried enough

143
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,712
So you want me to stop working?
Go home and mourn the loss?

144
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,314
What is the name of the girl
who tried to end her life?

145
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,119
Janki.
Ward number?

146
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,294
Since Mr Goenka insisted,
l had to tell him that you...

147
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,225
Why did you bring me back?

148
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,853
From where?

149
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,123
From that world, which is
far better than this one

150
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,459
Have you seen that world?
No

151
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,104
So how can you say it´s
a better world than this one?

152
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:52,576
Because l have seen this world.
Why did you bring me back?

153
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,717
Love is beautiful, Janki

154
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,250
Not when you see with my eyes

155
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,715
Why not look at it through my eyes?

156
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,723
lf you did, you´d know...
how much life means

157
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,123
Why must l look at it
through your eyes?

158
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,926
Maybe not mine, look at it through
the eyes of those who love you

159
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,198
What happens of them?

160
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,646
You will leave only
questions for them

161
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,781
Questions, they´ll seek answers to,
all their lives

162
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:50,328
l´ve lost someone too.
ln an accident

163
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,998
l know what the anguish
of losing someone is

164
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:12,749
All l will tell you is,
whatever there is... is right here

165
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,062
There´s nothing there

166
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,728
Whatever we gain,
we gain here

167
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,399
Whatever we lose,
we lose right here

168
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,971
Why do you want to lose
what you´ve got?

169
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,735
You don´t get to live
every now and then?

170
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,272
You don´t get anything a second time.
Nothing

171
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,544
Why hasn´t Akash come yet?
He said he´d be coming

172
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,653
l wonder where he´s held up.
Good for him if he comes

173
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,420
A couple of drinks
will make him feel better

174
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,586
He´s going to go mad.
He´s thinking of Maya all the time

175
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:57,693
And he´ll get nothing out of that.
He must accept what has happened

176
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,800
He must, no doubt. But you know
how sensitive he is about Maya

177
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,416
Here´s some beer for you

178
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,192
Richard, get another beer

179
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,787
What have you been talking about?
About you

180
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,527
You´ll live a hundred years.
Thank of you, and there you are

181
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,200
Live a hundred years! lsn´t that what
you told Maya so many times too?

182
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,248
And what happened?
Did she live a hundred years?

183
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,601
Where are you going...?
Where...?

184
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,533
Sit down

185
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,677
l´ve ruined your evening

186
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,647
lt was a slip of the tongue,
l´m sorry

187
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,599
Hasn´t your cough been cured yet?

188
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,774
Did you take that cough syrup
l gave you?

189
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,938
You never listen to me.
l´ll take it...

190
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,978
stop being a doctor
so late in the night

191
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,083
You´re always feeding me
a dose of medicine

192
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,386
All right, give me 22 rupees

193
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,613
22 rupees?

194
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,393
l must ask for much more

195
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,995
Because what l´m going to give you
is worth much more

196
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,194
Maya´s parcel has arrived.
l had to pay 22 rupees as postage

197
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,404
Let me have it

198
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,068
Maya´s parcel...?
How can it arrive?

199
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,943
Six months old. Thanks to the
postal department, it arrives now

200
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,445
Here you are. Revive old memories and
keep awake all night for all l care

201
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,455
Hey! My 22 rupees!

202
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,454
l owe it as a friend.
l´ll return it to you

203
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,462
That parrot of yours
makes a lot of noise

204
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,067
Take him with you tomorrow.
And go to bed early

205
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,575
What´s the matter?
Tanya was complaining about you

206
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,791
You are my life.
You are with me...

207
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:32,067
l no longer care
for this world

208
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:36,272
l´ll take a life,
l´ll give up my life...

209
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:50,219
l don´t care what price
l have to pay

210
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:57,187
You are my life.
You are with me...

211
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:16,664
There´s no other desire
like your love...

212
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:28,050
for yours is a love that
is not put on

213
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:35,455
Nature has bestowed on you
unparalleled beauty...

214
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:41,398
it is untouched by the
corruption in the world

215
00:26:54,313 --> 00:27:00,115
l must have it
at any cost...

216
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:06,115
l don´t care, even if
l have to lose my life for it

217
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:12,125
You are my life.
You are with me...

218
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:35,186
You are my God,
you are my faith...

219
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:41,184
that you love me,
is a great favour to me

220
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:52,535
You are the brightness
of the morning for me...

221
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:58,802
for me, you are
a silken evening

222
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:11,256
l wish to live
in your heart all my life...

223
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,259
l care not for another nest

224
00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:29,645
You are my life.
You are with me...

225
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:42,651
l no longer care
for this world

226
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,674
You´re not going there Maya.
l am!

227
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:08,069
People there are dying in the floods.
Children, women, the old...

228
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,707
And no doctor is willing to go there.
l am going there

229
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,045
There is the problem of militancy.
lt´s very dangerous there

230
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,548
Please don´t be stubborn.
You are the one who´s being stubborn

231
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,385
Don´t go is all you´ve been
saying for the last two days

232
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,059
As a doctor, how can you stop another
doctor from doing her duty?

233
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,399
Why must only doctors from Delhi go the
Burma borders to perform their duty?

234
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,001
Are there no doctors in Calcutta,
Assam, Mizoram and Manipur?

235
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:34,736
There are. But they are not interested
in going to the Burma borders

236
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,142
ln fact, no one wants to go there

237
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:40,105
Not doctors, not engineers,
not even the politicians

238
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,781
Why would anyone go there?
Not everyone is naive like you

239
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,118
l´m better off being naive

240
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,057
You´re not going all alone

241
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,960
You´re carrying my baby with you

242
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,007
You need to rest.
Akki...

243
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:13,478
you were the one who said, we´re
doctors first, everything else later

244
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:19,143
Have faith in me. l´ll look after
myself and look after my baby too

245
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,882
Please. Let me go

246
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,887
lf you really love me,
you mustn´t go

247
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:34,522
lf you really love me, you will
not stop me from going there

248
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,642
What will he teach me?
He´s an ass!

249
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:05,008
So you teach him.
That´s what l´ve got to do

250
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,013
He´s an ass!

251
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:10,222
So tell me. How many years
have you known Akash?

252
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:12,652
5 years.
5 years

253
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,587
How many years will
you tolerate him?

254
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,728
Looks like l´ll have to
tolerate him all my life

255
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:19,865
All your life...?
What if he dies before you?

256
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,030
l´ll go away before you

257
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:28,198
l´ll go away before you,
but l won´t stop following you

258
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:31,907
l´ll come to meet you every day.
Every day!

259
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,518
You´re so worried
about a paper-weight?

260
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,924
How could it fall on its own?
Why not? lt´s so simple.

261
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,167
lt´s not simple. Maya was the one
who gave me that paper-weight

262
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:58,935
So?
Not just the paper-weight

263
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:03,274
l found the projector on too.
You must´ve left it on

264
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,947
Unless someone manually switches on
the project, it can´t come on, Tanya

265
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,549
So what are you trying to tell me?
That Maya came to you last night?

266
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,181
She was the one who switched on
the projector?

267
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,358
And dropped the paper-weight?
How else did it all happen?

268
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:25,327
lt happened because you still haven´t
accepted that Maya is no more, Akash

269
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,563
lt happens.
lt happened to me too

270
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:35,565
When someone you love so dearly
goes away suddenly...

271
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:39,040
we are just not willing
to accept the truth

272
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,846
For a few days, we feel as if
they´re somewhere around us

273
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:51,052
That´s what you must be feeling too.
l mean...

274
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:55,060
probably that paper-weight
was on the edge, and slipped off

275
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,062
But you...

276
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:07,869
Ever since Maya has gone away,
it´s very strange at home

277
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:12,909
Bittu has fallen silent too

278
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,775
Whenever Maya knocked
at the door earlier...

279
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,778
he´d begin chanting,
Maya´s back! Maya´s back!

280
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:26,658
lt says nothing now. A scary silence
has descended on the house

281
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:31,458
Akash, take a few days off

282
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,467
My flight´s taking off for Goa

283
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:42,131
l had promised Maya that l would
look after her patients

284
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,647
Take care, Akash

285
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:12,204
l know what´s playing
on your mind right now

286
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:16,935
Just that l´ve made you wait
six months for a little favour

287
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:22,907
l´m happy you have helped me,
even if it´s a bit late

288
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,652
You take instant decisions
during surgery...

289
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,923
but official matters take time

290
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:39,057
l´m not a very bad man. lt´s just
that l have my own responsibilities

291
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:42,430
Which is why... l´ve got to be
a bit firm at times

292
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:45,168
There´s something more l´ve
got to tell you

293
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,274
You´re going to work where
Maya used to work and l hope...

294
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,843
you will not give anyone
cause for complaint

295
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,477
Just as Maya loved children
and treated them...

296
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,647
l´ll do that too, Dr. Goenka

297
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,995
Happiness of the past
is always painful

298
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:24,174
Despite knowing that, l started
spending my nights...

299
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:27,001
in Maya´s ward,
to escape loneliness

300
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:32,382
l had no other way of
finding peace of mind

301
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:40,053
Like everyone else, l did not
believe God, souls and rebirth...

302
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:46,387
which give us only false hopes.
Little did l know...

303
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,732
that faith would cast its rays
on my life...

304
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:54,737
that would gradually develop
into an ocean...

305
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,065
and change the course
of my life

306
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:31,295
Akki! Can you hear me?

307
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:51,243
lt has happened earlier, doctor

308
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:55,787
Twice earlier,
we thought Nakul was dead

309
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:02,589
There was nothing to tell us
that he was alive

310
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:05,955
And he suddenly returns to life.
He says...

311
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:08,463
he has passed through some tunnel...

312
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:12,971
where there was a lot of light
and everything was very clear

313
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:17,231
Do you believe in such things?
l didn´t earlier

314
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:21,342
But the last time Nakul
came back...

315
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,848
he told me that he had
met my elder sister

316
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:30,446
After just an hour,
l got a call from my village...

317
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:34,017
that my elder sister had passed away

318
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,514
l´m Dr Akash Bhatnagar

319
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:06,914
ln any case, you don´t need an
introduction in Dr Maya´s ward

320
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:12,187
The child who was brought into
the lCU... what was his name?

321
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,836
Can l meet him?

322
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:23,270
Dr Maya used to ask about him
the moment she arrived too

323
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:26,201
She used to love him very much

324
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,670
l want to see Nakul

325
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:08,719
How is he now?
See for yourself

326
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,578
He´s been drawing
as if nothing had happened to him

327
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,727
You like to draw?
What are you drawing?

328
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:21,395
l don´t know. l´ve been thinking
about it, ever since l came around

329
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,070
Last night you were shocked,
weren´t you uncle?

330
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:30,366
Last night? When?
When your glasses got wet

331
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:36,112
How do you know?
l was watching you

332
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:40,340
Watching me?
Yes, from the ceiling

333
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:46,117
Nakul, do your drawings,
talk less

334
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,983
Nurse, l have to talk to him.
You can´t, doctor

335
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:52,524
We have strict instruction from
the hospital authorities

336
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:56,561
We must discourage patients
from talking like that

337
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,870
Talking like what?
Like Sister Martha used to

338
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:06,143
She used to record the experiences
of the dead who came back to life

339
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:09,308
She used to quiz them
in a way that would make them uneasy

340
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:15,483
But Sister Martha never met me.
Had she, l´d have told her so much

341
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:18,287
l remember everything
that l had seen there

342
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:28,332
Doctor, l have to check on a patient
at ward two. l´ll be back soon

343
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:45,813
Do you know my name, Nakul?

344
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,589
Akash, Have you heard it before?

345
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:03,563
Akash

346
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:07,065
Akki

347
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,676
Maya´s Akki?

348
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:22,582
Yes... Maya´s Akki

349
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:25,646
l met Maya too yesterday

350
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,327
Where?
l don´t know

351
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:34,496
lt was so bright there
and water everywhere

352
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:38,102
She was saying something?
What was she saying?

353
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,002
What was she saying, Nakul?

354
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,871
What was she saying, Nakul?
Akki!

355
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:48,845
Akki!

356
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:09,186
According to recent medical studies,
all those who have had...

357
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:15,056
near-death experience say that
there´s a tunnel, brightness...

358
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:17,899
That´s what most of them say
l wonder why

359
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:24,202
Let me explain. Medical science
studies show that after death...

360
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:30,707
the cornea slowly shrinks and creates
a tunnel-shaped image in the brain

361
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:33,983
But Akash says the boy
remembers much more

362
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,986
Like, Akash´s entry into the room,
watching him on the sly...

363
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:43,988
Could be. The body dies
but the brain doesn´t die instantly

364
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:58,369
The brain saves those impressions
that the person sees before his death

365
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:05,173
When did he see a drop of water falling
on my glasses? He was never around

366
00:48:06,685 --> 00:48:09,210
He was dying when he was
being taken away in a stretcher

367
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,992
l felt as if he was
calling out to me Akki

368
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:22,997
Only your daughter used
to call me Akki, no one else

369
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:37,909
You are a psychiatrist, Neha.
What do you have to say?

370
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:43,580
Papa, a psychiatrist first listens.
l would like to hear from Akash

371
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:47,721
What does he feel these days?
These days? What do you mean?

372
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,058
l have told you all that
what is happening with me

373
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:57,535
All but one thing. Do you really feel
that Maya is calling out to you?

374
00:49:00,572 --> 00:49:03,541
l don´t think so.
Check yourself, Akash

375
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,043
Could it be that you are scared
of telling the truth?

376
00:49:24,763 --> 00:49:26,287
Papa, l´ll be back

377
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:45,173
Akash, l won´t charge you fees
if you consult me

378
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:50,514
l don´t need to.
l knew that would be your answer

379
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,657
l´d like to tell you something
l didn´t tell you back there

380
00:49:56,094 --> 00:50:00,428
Maya was not merely my wife, she was
a friend, she meant everything to me

381
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:08,130
Yes, l miss her. And l feel that she
is somewhere around trying to meet me

382
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,372
But that doesn´t mean that
l have forgotten the truth

383
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:15,911
l know that l can´t
get back Maya ever again

384
00:50:18,817 --> 00:50:21,581
Wait, Akash.
Don´t leave like that

385
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,583
Pour your heart out
and feel less burdened

386
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:30,917
l don´t need to tell anyone
what l feel and what l don´t

387
00:51:58,149 --> 00:52:02,711
Sometimes fragrance,
sometimes a waft...

388
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:07,420
sometimes l feel it´s the breeze

389
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,755
You are far away from me...

390
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:17,828
yet l feel you are within me

391
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:08,480
This only thought...

392
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:12,580
keeps me away at nights

393
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:20,924
Should l sleep...

394
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:27,431
l would dream about you

395
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:33,268
And when at dawn...

396
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:37,544
my eyes open...

397
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,920
like the stars...

398
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:50,657
you would vanish too

399
00:53:56,134 --> 00:54:00,332
Coming to me and going away...

400
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:04,734
hurts... hurts a lot

401
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:10,671
You are far away from me...

402
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:15,516
yet l feel you are within me

403
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,915
What´s your name?
Biren

404
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:25,684
l´m Akash.
l know

405
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:36,060
Your sketches are so lovely

406
00:55:37,268 --> 00:55:39,236
She is calling out to you

407
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:48,545
Who is calling out to me?
She said she was a doctor here

408
00:55:49,614 --> 00:55:54,108
Doctor? Who?
Her picture is hung near the corridor

409
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:56,919
The one who has
worn Santa Claus´ gown

410
00:55:57,322 --> 00:55:59,688
She´s calling out to you,
uncle Akash

411
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:07,991
l don´t understand anything.
When l was being brought here...

412
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,501
l saw her in my dream

413
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:15,131
lsn´t she dead, uncle?

414
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:20,838
Was it only a dream?
Probably

415
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:24,915
But she is calling you, uncle.
Where is she calling me?

416
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:31,644
All right, have we met before?
l don´t know

417
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:37,292
Then how do you know me?
She showed me a picture of yours

418
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,892
Where? Where did she
show you my picture?

419
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:45,661
ln some picture?
ln my mind

420
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:54,770
Can you tell me where you met her?
Do you know the place?

421
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,708
Over there

422
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:05,849
There? How will l get there?

423
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,821
How does one get there?
l don´t know

424
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:33,876
The boy in room 302...?
302? Biren?

425
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,947
Yes. Did he know my wife?

426
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,253
l´ll check, hang on

427
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:55,127
No doctor, this is the first time
the boy is admitted here

428
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:57,607
That too only two weeks back

429
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:02,010
Knowing your wife
is just out of question

430
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:15,492
Nakul was a patient
who was everyone´s pet

431
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:20,290
His coming back to life
and saying that he met Maya...

432
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:23,259
Chocolate for your coffee?
No

433
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:29,662
Nakul says that Maya is in some place
where it´s full of light...

434
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,436
and water all around

435
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,040
Biren too says Maya
is calling me out there

436
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,508
Too much sugar, no?
Why aren´t you listening to me?

437
00:58:39,684 --> 00:58:42,710
What´s all this about chocolate and
coffee? l wish to tell you something

438
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:46,588
And l intend to distract you from
all these things that are unrealistic

439
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,926
Unrealistic? How can you be sure?

440
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:52,589
Four years ago
when Vinod passed away...

441
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:56,593
and l was running crazy looking
for him everywhere, you helped me out

442
00:58:56,968 --> 00:59:01,234
l said he´s alive and he´ll return
and you used to tell me it´s absurd

443
00:59:00,973 --> 00:59:02,736
Didn´t you say that?
But Tanya...

444
00:59:04,075 --> 00:59:07,977
But what? Have you forgotten?
So many times you and Maya...

445
00:59:08,346 --> 00:59:11,281
brought me back from the accident site
where l used to wait for Vinod

446
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:15,185
Because l felt he was alive
and he´d return

447
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:20,648
l lost a year and a half of my life
just to understand that...

448
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:23,585
a person never returns from the dead

449
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,997
l don´t want you to lose
years of your life too

450
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:34,129
All that l told you is real

451
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:39,172
Akash, you are a doctor.
How could you believe all this?

452
00:59:39,778 --> 00:59:42,042
What explanation does
all this have scientifically?

453
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:47,047
lf you think too much about it,
you will go crazy

454
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:52,384
Stay away from all those things
that remind you of Maya

455
01:01:11,236 --> 01:01:12,760
lt´s Maya!

456
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,207
Maya is here!
