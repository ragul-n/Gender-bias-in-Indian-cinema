1
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,450
Vikram...

2
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,240
Vikram,

3
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,320
Vikram,

4
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,650
Vikram, please Vikram
I am sacred

5
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,360
Leave me,
-Sushmi

6
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,860
Vikram...

7
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,860
Sushmi...

8
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,490
Vikram, please Vikram,

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,200
I am scared.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,740
Leave me
Please.

11
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,280
Who are you guys?

12
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,530
Vikram...

13
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,950
Hey, leave her....

14
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,030
Sushmi ,Please
-No

15
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,110
No...,
Please... Please...

16
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,150
Vikram

17
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,700
I hate to tell you this.

18
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,110
But you need to quit the department, Vikram.

19
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,740
I am telling you on a serious note.

20
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,200
What..?

21
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,700
I can't quit the force.

22
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Don't you understand?

23
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,860
This is classic post-traumatic stress.

24
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,610
And it has come to stage where your vitals are being affected.

25
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,610
Your blood pressure is off the roof.

26
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,490
And if you keep doing this, it's going to...
-I know.

27
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,150
Give me some medications and I'll manage.

28
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,320
But to leave this department is not my option at all.
-Medication is not going to help you Vikram.

29
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,650
The problem is, the small incidents that happen
at your work is reminding you of your past.

30
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,740
It's like a trigger.

31
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,450
And that is why you have all these panic attacks.

32
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,280
If your vitals are consistently affected,
it will definitely cause problems to your heart.

33
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,990
Keep this confidential Roopa, thanks!

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,240
"The wound that chases me..."

35
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,820
"Wonder what I've wronged..."

36
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,990
"How far should I go,
for peace..."

37
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:05,030
"The thorns of the past in my eye...
The path that is filled with landmines..."

38
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,110
"The identity of which is concealed
Many questions dawn upon me."

39
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,900
"The memories have quietly become my enemy"

40
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,240
"A war that I am waging against myself"

41
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,400
"The past jumps at me and draws its sword.
The dreams are filled with blood."

42
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:38,280
"The time creates a cyclone in my heart..."

43
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:46,320
"Chaos unfolds when the past takes its revenge."

44
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,400
"Let the hatred come to me.
But, I won't lose..."

45
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,900
"Life is not like before
But I can't escape..."

46
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,280
"Wonder if it's a dream or some illusion...
I just don't remember"

47
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:36,200
"Wonder if it's a dream or some illusion...
I don't have proof"

48
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,900
Hi Vikram.

49
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,110
Morning sir.

50
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,070
Can you stop that noise first?

51
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,030
Hey, shut the machine down.

52
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,200
We have information that the dead body is somewhere here.

53
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,990
We have been looking around here for the
last six hours but in vain.

54
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,570
The search area is vast too.

55
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,900
Vishwa sir asked us to take your help and keep in touch with you.

56
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,320
Sir, it's not that way...
Everyone is....

57
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,320
Roni, salute.

58
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,900
Why is he picking wild shrubs, sir?

59
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,530
Watch...

60
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,320
Call all the constables here.

61
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,200
These are wild shrubs.

62
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,450
If you see all these three wild shrubs
growing together at any place, inform me.

63
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:41,860
Sir...

64
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,820
Rohit, please take care.

65
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,400
Split the team into two and send them in each direction.

66
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,320
You go this way and you, the other way.

67
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,030
What is your name?

68
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,740
Seenu.

69
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,240
Do you go to school?

70
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,530
Tell me the truth otherwise
I will take you along in the jeep.

71
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,780
No

72
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,200
Go and bring your owner.

73
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,900
Sir

74
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Dig this place.

75
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,200
Who is here from the forensics?

76
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
It's me, sir.

77
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,780
Hey...

78
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,280
Dig slowly.

79
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,320
Boys...
- Sir

80
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,570
Get the stretcher, quick.
-Yes, Sir.

81
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,900
Cover the body properly.

82
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,360
Govind, quick

83
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,240
Get it into the van.

84
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,740
Wait for me, I'll be right back
-Are you okay?

85
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,950
Boys quick.Boys, keep moving....
-Let's go!

86
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,860
How did you locate the dead body?

87
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,530
Do you know why farmers remove wild shrubs from the fields?

88
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,320
Weeds release certain biochemicals
into the soil, something like poison.

89
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,320
So that, no other plants grow in their vicinity.

90
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,700
If we dig a place where these wild shrubs grow,
the biochemicals in the soil get disturbed.

91
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,700
This facilitates all wild shrubs to grow together at that place

92
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,240
All I did was to identify the place which had been dug recently.
That's about it!

93
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,280
Please ask the forensic team
to collect the samples.

94
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,490
I need the reports as soon as possible.
-Yes, sir.

95
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,900
What job do you have here?

96
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,200
Vishwa sir had asked us to check on this.

97
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,240
I wasn't informed of anything on this.

98
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,070
Sir...

99
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,400
Sir...

100
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,200
It's not required sir... I can take care.

101
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,240
Okay sir.

102
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,150
He and his beard...

103
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,320
Does he even look like he is from the police department?

104
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,150
Isn't that what he wants, sir?

105
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,070
Sir, to blend into the common public you guys...

106
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,240
Sorry sir.

107
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,150
So, what happened?

108
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,490
Don't act smart.

109
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,610
Nothing much here.
It's a clear case of suicide.

110
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,200
But I am wondering why they put you on this case.

111
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,990
You had a look right?

112
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,280
Why do you all assume this to be a suicide?

113
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,400
Here....it's a video suicide note.

114
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,700
There was a time when it was written on a paper.

115
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,360
Now that the technology has advanced,
they are making video suicide notes.

116
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,360
"I am responsible for my own death, I am sorry."

117
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,900
Can I?

118
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,610
Are you so stupid?
Abhilash....

119
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,820
I wonder who stopped the video after his
death if he was all alone in the room?

120
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,610
I am very sure that there was a second
person in the room to stop the video.

121
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,570
And there are no third party apps to
have a "self stop" option on his phone.

122
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,530
And you've been touching the phone with out gloves.

123
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,820
Are you all not getting any strange
pungent smell in this room?

124
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,530
Do you know what this is?`

125
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,070
This is called 'ink varnish'.

126
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,650
This is only used by painters, carpenters and people
who work in the ink manufacturing company.

127
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,530
As I can see, there are no broken
windows or doors in this house.

128
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,150
So this person must have opened the
door for who ever came into this house.

129
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,070
So, definitely a person he knows well.

130
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,150
But that idiot must've jumped
out of the window instead of leaving through the main door.

131
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,990
There are marks on the pipe.

132
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,200
The piece that got stuck to his shoes must
have fallen down while jumping out of the window.

133
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,530
So start your investigation from all the
people in his contact list that are painters, carpenters or

134
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,780
those who work in any ink manufacturing company.

135
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,490
That's your lead.

136
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,570
It must be a suiside by force

137
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,740
Hey Abhilash, if you need to solve a crime,
grooming has to be here and not here.

138
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,990
Give it a try from next time on!

139
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Did Srinivas call you?

140
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,990
Yes he is in contact with us,
he just spoke to us the last week.

141
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,360
Do let me know in case of any problem.

142
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,820
I....

143
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,320
Hey,
-Hi

144
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,320
You came too early.

145
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,860
I'll need some more time.

146
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,490
I can wait. Go ahead,
-Are you sure?

147
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,280
Hi, Rohit
-Hi, Neha

148
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,280
Should I order a coffee for you?

149
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,110
No, I am good.
-It's okay. We're fine.

150
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,150
You can go and finish your work.
We'll be waiting for you.

151
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,780
Okay, I'll be back.

152
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,240
Hi doctor, are the results in?

153
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,150
Yeah, in two hours

154
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,950
We're trying to improve.

155
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,820
Ideally, if you can validate a technique to
match DNA in an hour, it'll be perfect!

156
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,280
Keep me posted.

157
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,030
Ramana sir, are the ballistic reports ready?

158
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,200
It is getting ready.

159
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,280
Please email it to Mr. Venkatesh and cc the mail to me.

160
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,200
How is mom doing?

161
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Situation is not very good.

162
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,240
Doctors advised that she has to be shifted to Bombay.

163
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,650
My brother is anyways there,
so he said that he will take her there in a weeks time.

164
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,030
Don't hesitate to ask for help.

165
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,110
Prioritise your parents first.
-Of course.

166
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,490
Try to depixelate the picture a little more.

167
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,990
Investigators will definitely send it back.

168
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,200
Give your best shot.

169
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,700
How is Swapna?
-She is fine.

170
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,950
Why don't you come home sometime?

171
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,820
You haven't come to the new home yet.
-Yes, sure sometime next week.

172
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,530
Hey, Vikram...

173
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,150
Hey, Hi Shinde

174
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,450
Is Neha making you wait as usual?

175
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,740
I've sent you the email, check it once.

176
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,950
She is in some new case...
-Sorry, let's go.

177
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,610
Shinde, please come along.
-No... No.

178
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,450
I just came to greet him once.
You all carry on.

179
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,150
Bye.
-Bye Shinde.

180
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,860
Okay Vikram, I'll make a move.
She must be waiting for me.

181
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,950
Yeah
-Bye, Neha,

182
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,070
So?

183
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,200
Tell me, how was your day?

184
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,360
Yeah, it was fine.

185
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,030
Roopa called me.

186
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,200
Can't she keep a patient's information confidential?

187
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,400
Will you put a case on us, now?

188
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,700
Please put these inside.

189
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,030
Do you need some coffee?

190
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,740
Yes, please.

191
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,200
Why Vicky?

192
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,200
What is the problem in leaving this job
if it's destroying your health?

193
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,950
Stop it, Neha.

194
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,610
What happened Rohit?

195
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,400
Are you thinking about your mom?

196
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,110
Don't stress about all these during this time.

197
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,490
Are you taking all your medications properly?

198
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,110
Please think about it for me, Vicky.

199
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,200
I don't want to lose you.

200
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,860
Your blood pressure is constantly raised.
-Neha, please...

201
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,740
I know that you are saying this for my good.

202
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,950
But if I leave this job, I will be miserable
Please try and understand.

203
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,530
Explain me, why?

204
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,990
How is Vikram?

205
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,990
He is fine.

206
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,610
You should ask him to come home once.

207
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,110
He hasn't come after we moved here.

208
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,740
I told him just a while ago...
He said he will come at his convenience.

209
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,990
I don't know how to explain this to you, Neha.

210
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,740
It's all... It's all related to my past.

211
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,150
Exactly! You've never...
-I know I never told you anything about my past.

212
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,570
But trust me,

213
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
if I lose my job, I'll lose my sanity.

214
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,650
At times when I talk to you,
I get this feeling that I am talking to a stranger.

215
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,320
Who are you Vikram?

216
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,280
What happened in your life?

217
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,240
I will tell you Neha.

218
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,110
But not right now.

219
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,610
Do me a favour.

220
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,570
At least take a sabbatical leave and go to your home town.

221
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,860
Take the treatment that Roopa has suggested.

222
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,650
And once that is done, you can join back in the force.Okay?

223
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,110
Can't you understand what I am trying to say?

224
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,400
I can't do this.

225
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,900
Roopa is unable to understand my problem.

226
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,240
By the way, Roopa is your friend, right?

227
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,950
So she will definitely suggest what you want.

228
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,700
If you can't do this in the least, then it's better you leave me.

229
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,570
I am not asking you to quit permanently, right?

230
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,030
Listen to me or stop seeing me from tomorrow.

231
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,030
I am just trying to help you Vikram.

232
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,450
Hello Hyderabad,

233
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,070
We have seen a drastic decrease in crime rate with the HIT wing
working hard to prevent murders in our state.

234
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,030
Which in turn, is helping the city to be a safer place to live in by
addressing missing person cases and kidnapping cases.

235
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,450
Thanks to our police.

236
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,450
And the topic for today is women's safety.
Let's start our program with the first caller...

237
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,490
Morning sir.

238
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,950
Hey, Vishnu...

239
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,320
stop watching videos and
mind your business.

240
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,990
You head the wing that prevents murders
and you are asking for a 6 months leave!

241
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,860
I wouldn't have asked this if I had a choice, sir.

242
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,950
Why all of a sudden?

243
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,990
It's because of a personal reason, sir.

244
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,200
Did you think about this properly?

245
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,200
Since you mentioned that you will be
available anytime over the phone,

246
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,150
I am granting you this leave.

247
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,030
You may go.

248
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,110
Thank you, sir.

249
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Sir, I'll just be back.

250
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,400
Sorry.

251
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,820
Did she leave?

252
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,950
Yeah don't worry, she'll be back.

253
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,450
Hey Siri,

254
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,500
Hey Siri,

255
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What happened?
-My car broke down, Sir

256
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,910
Where do you stay?
-Quite near, in Raviryal gated community.

257
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,870
Come, I will drop you.

258
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,750
No, not in the police jeep, sir

259
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,830
Did you call someone?

260
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,200
I forgot my phone back home.

261
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,700
That's why I was going back to get it, when the car broke down.

262
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,040
Tell me the phone number,

263
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,950
Daddy, it's a police officer...

264
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,120
My car stopped at the ORR.

265
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,620
I forgot my phone back at home.

266
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,580
Can you come and pick me up?

267
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,080
Somewhere between the Raviryal toll gate
and the Pedda Golconda toll gate.

268
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,160
I am on the other side of the road, towards our home.

269
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,500
Okay, I'll leave.

270
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,830
You will manage, right?

271
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,910
Sure, sir.
-Thank you!

272
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,580
Ok.

273
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,700
Sir..

274
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,870
Hey, don't shout...
-Sir.. sir..

275
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,950
What did he do?

276
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,450
Some petty case.

277
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,910
Sir, please leave me sir.
- I don't know anything.

278
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,080
I did not do anything.

279
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,080
Hey, what is the file that CI asked for?
And what file did you get him?

280
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,330
What happened?

281
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,290
Speak out..
-Sir.. sir..

282
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,200
Show me your hands.

283
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,330
I'll go and bring that file.

284
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,120
Show me your hands.

285
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,290
He is not listening to us,
smear some chilli powder on it.

286
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,620
Hey, shut up.

287
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,160
Narsimha...
-SIr.

288
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,250
Are you out of your mind?

289
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,410
Look at what file you gave me.
-Sorry sir

290
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,910
Did you give me the correct file at least this time?
-Sir.

291
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,580
What happened?

292
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,370
Just some time ago, my daughter
called me from this place, sir.

293
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,120
Yes, she called from my phone.
What happened?

294
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,540
Is it?
Where is my daughter, sir?

295
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,120
I saw her talking to someone who came in a blue car.

296
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,450
I thought it must be you. Is it not you?
-No, sir

297
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,200
Lakshmi, did Preeti get back home?

298
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,700
No, there is just a small confusion.

299
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,870
Put down the phone, I'll come back,

300
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,250
Sir, Preeti has not reached home yet.

301
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,080
Okay, you can go home.
She will be back by evening.

302
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,790
She must have gone out with her friends.

303
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,200
If she does not return by evening, call me.

304
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,580
I am right at the Golconda police station, SI Ibrahim.

305
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,120
Okay, sir

306
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,620
Sir, my daughter is not home yet.

307
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,950
Why didn't you call me yesterday?
-Don't you understand?

308
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,330
If you had taken this seriously yesterday itself...

309
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,000
You are the last person to speak to her.

310
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,500
Why did you leave her all alone?
-Hey...

311
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,160
Hold on.

312
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,200
I asked your daughter to get into the jeep
so that I can drop her home.

313
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,830
But she did not want to get into a police
jeep and then she called you.

314
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,120
And why are you shouting at me?

315
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,250
Am I your daughter's personal security guard?

316
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,120
There is the constable, go and register a missing complaint.

317
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
We will search.

318
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,500
I am not your maid to
get threatened if you raise your voice.

319
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,160
Get lost.

320
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,830
Sir, please, sir...
-Go madam.

321
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,830
Hey Narsimha,
-Sir

322
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,540
Look into it...

323
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,330
By the way, is the car still lying there or
did you happen to get it back in the night?

324
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,540
We have been searching for
my daughter all through the night.

325
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,410
We did not even go to the car yet.

326
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,660
What is your name?
-Vasavi, sir

327
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,290
Vasavi, how do you capture CCTV footage here?

328
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,540
There are two cameras here, sir.

329
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,790
One towards the road and the other towards the toll gate.

330
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,370
I need the entire footage from
5:30p.m to 6:30p.m from yesterday.

331
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,330
Okay sir...
-I need footage from both the cameras.

332
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,200
Okay sir.

333
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:31,250
Did you see any blue colour car around 6'o' clock,
dropping a girl who is around twenty years of age?

334
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,830
No, sir

335
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,200
There is no such blue car that can be
seen to be exiting in that time frame, sir

336
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,950
Anything from the camera that faces the road?
-No, sir.

337
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,700
There is something wrong, Narsimha.

338
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,540
Because I saw her talking to someone in a blue car, yesterday.

339
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,450
Where would the car disappear
without taking an exit or continuing on the same road?

340
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,580
Do one thing.
-Sir

341
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,120
Go to Pedda Golconda toll gate and get
me the CCTV footage from all the four entrances.

342
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,290
We will see if there is any blue car entering.

343
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:05,870
Ok, Sir.

344
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,870
Sir

345
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,120
I heard that you spoke some nonsense with them yesterday.

346
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,620
It's not like that, sir.
-Shut up.

347
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,080
You did a mistake and on top of it you dare to argue with me?
-What did I do, sir?

348
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,040
Don't utter a word.

349
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,750
Are you lazy enough not to work?

350
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,370
Where is your gun?
-It's in my desk, sir

351
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,370
Get that gun
-Sir

352
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,290
I am suspending you.

353
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,290
Aren't you the one who spoke to her last, yesterday?

354
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,750
If you are called in for investigating,
you should come submissively.

355
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,330
If you do not co-operate, I will simply burry you!

356
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,620
Got it?

357
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,620
Sir.

358
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,200
Hey, if you want to go out of the city,
inform Narsimha and go.

359
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,660
Don't worry Mohan, I will hand this case
to the best man in the department.

360
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,500
We will definitely find Preeti.

361
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,450
Hello...
-This is Shinde calling from forensics.

362
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,580
Yes, tell me Shinde
-Vikram, Neha is gone missing.

363
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,000
What?
-She has gone missing

364
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,370
Neha?

365
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,950
Vikram...she is nowhere to be found since two days.

366
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,870
How can she be missing?

367
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,500
Vikram

368
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,700
Hello...

369
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,330
Vikram...

370
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,500
Vikram, hello

371
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,120
Sir
-Sit, Vikram

372
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,250
Sir, what is happening?
Sir, how can Neha go missing?

373
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,830
Don't worry, we will take care of it.

374
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,410
Please give me all the details.
Please hand over Neha's case to me.

375
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,790
It is being handled by someone.
-Who is that?

376
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,410
Sir, please transfer the case to me.
-It is not possible.

377
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,330
And I'll tell you why...
I spoke to your partner, Rohit.

378
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,290
I heard that you had a fight with Neha just before your left.

379
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,120
Taking a sabbatical leave for six months
and going to your hometown like never before,

380
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,830
and Neha to go missing around the same time puts you in a spot.

381
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,750
I spoke to Neha's mother as well.

382
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,500
She asked me to keep an eye on you.

383
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,040
All of this leads me to suspect you, Vikram.

384
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,540
Once all the formalities are done,
I will call you for questioning.

385
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,200
But until then, if you try to involve in my case...

386
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,370
I swear...
-Hey...

387
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,580
Sorry, sir.

388
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,750
Sir, why didn't you call me first?

389
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,700
If I did call you, you'd fight for this case.

390
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,120
So...?

391
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,370
If you handle your girlfriend's missing case...

392
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,660
you will handle it with emotions
rather than your intelligence.

393
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,950
It'll be too personal.

394
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,040
Sir, you are not understanding...

395
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,410
And Abhilash came forward and is suspecting you.

396
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,370
So, you cannot get involved in this case.

397
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,830
Not that you did something,
but to facilitate objective investigation is my duty.

398
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,290
Sir, that is my problem too.

399
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,290
He will stop all the objective investigation
and shift his entire focus on me.

400
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,250
I know him.
-Sit tight, Vikram.

401
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,790
Abhilash and myself will handle this case.

402
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,660
Not happening, sir.

403
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,290
Sir, I am going to start my own investigation.

404
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,700
Even if you like it or not.

405
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,540
Hello Rohit, where are you?

406
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,330
What is happening, Rohit?

407
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,160
I called to the office as she wasn't answering her phone.

408
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,370
And Shinde told me about this.

409
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,080
She spoke to me casually over the phone
just the night before.

410
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,830
Did you sense anything the last time
you spoke to her?

411
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,580
Nothing seemed out of place
when I spoke to her about two days back

412
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,410
But I can sense that something happened after that.

413
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,450
I need to go into Neha's house, Rohit.

414
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,700
Are you sure?

415
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,500
If Abhilash gets to know of it, he will zero down on you for sure.

416
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,620
I cannot hold back because of him.
-It's Neha, Rohit.

417
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,000
Did you receive a phone call?
-I just received a call yesterday.

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,910
It's Abhilash's case, right

419
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,660
How far has the investigation progressed?

420
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,200
"You are not the right person for my daughter, Vikram,
please leave her."

421
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,580
I will speak with Abhilash
-Yes, sir

422
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,290
Ravi, please give me the keys once.

423
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:08,700
Here...

424
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,580
Is everything alright?

425
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,410
Okay sir.

426
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,040
There seems to be some loose contact.

427
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,330
Rohit, come.

428
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,200
Something must have happened that night.

429
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,330
Neha came home just like any other day.

430
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,330
She parked her car as usual.

431
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,620
There is no sign of forceful entry into the house.

432
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,040
But she disappeared the same night.

433
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,500
And also someone had come to her house, Rohit

434
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,790
In the living room, there is a strong attar...
attar smell.

435
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,660
But that could be from any one of the constables or police officers.

436
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,040
Alright, go get me the entire call list of Neha from the telephone department.

437
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,830
Vikram, Neha's mother.

438
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,040
Police Department are looking..

439
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,370
You don't worry, okay

440
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,120
Aunty, one second

441
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,080
I know that you don't like me.

442
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,870
But trust me, wherever Neha is, I will find her.

443
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,700
Come, let's get in and talk

444
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,750
Come in.

445
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,370
Tell me Vikram.

446
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,000
I need some information.

447
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,580
What is it?

448
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,330
For the last three months, I want the entire
details of all the cases Neha dealt with.

449
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,450
These are the case files Neha dealt with.

450
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,200
Files should not go out.

451
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,250
Rohit, check this case out.

452
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,500
What is it ?

453
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,830
This is about Preeti, an eighteen years old girl,
who went missing two months back.

454
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,290
Neha looked into this case.

455
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,830
She went missing on the ORR without any trace.

456
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,500
The disappearance pattern looks very similar.

457
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,540
The way it happened, gender and that too in the same city.

458
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,040
Too much of a coincidence.

459
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,290
Can you find out who is investigating this case?

460
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,500
Srinivas, from your department, is handling this case.

461
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,700
But what does it matter?

462
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,790
Srinivas, when was the last time you spoke to Neha?

463
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,700
She called me three days ago.

464
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,620
What did she say?

465
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
She was handling the missing case of Preeti, Vikram

466
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,500
She told me that she will reveal a possible
breakthrough after analysing about the case.

467
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,000
Before she could confirm and call me, she went missing.

468
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,580
Do you have any other information?

469
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,660
Any clue or evidence that you have from Preeti's crime scene?

470
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,950
Yeah, one second.

471
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,910
I found this piece of cotton from the car.

472
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,120
And a small needle from the roadside just beside the car

473
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,700
I sent the needle to the forensics

474
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:55,160
But there is no trace of Preeti's blood or DNA on it.

475
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,620
Maybe it was not related to this case at all.

476
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,040
And the crime scene was literally sterile...

477
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,370
That is all the evidence I have.

478
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,330
Nobody touched the money in the car's glove box

479
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:10,870
Sir...

480
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,200
Please assign the missing case of Preeti, sir.

481
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:14,830
Why ?

482
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,330
I need it.
I will explain it later, sir.

483
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,500
She is a family friend's daughter.

484
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,500
I will be more than happy if you can handle this case.

485
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,580
But I already assigned this case to Srinivas.

486
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,080
I will talk about this to Srinivas.

487
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,160
Please do that Vikram.

488
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,290
It's Vishwa's, personal interest
and he is nagging me every day.

489
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,160
I don't mind if he has no objection

490
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,830
Thank you, sir,
-Why the sudden interest?

491
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,790
I will explain it later, sir.

492
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,660
I need it , I am just following my hunch.

493
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:37,830
Vikram.

494
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,450
Sir...

495
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,000
Press is involved... Handle it very carefully.

496
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,660
Sure sir.

497
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,200
Trust me, Rohit, my senses don't cheat me.

498
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,700
I am sure the same guy who kidnapped
Preeti had been to Neha's house when she disappeared.

499
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,250
Who the f*** is this, man?

500
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,870
Okay, from where do we start now?

501
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,450
Preeti's case files, ORR entry and exit CCTV footage,

502
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,410
and all the case material sent to
forensics need to be on my table right away.

503
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,700
We will first study it and then start the investigation.

504
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,750
Also, call Shinde and ask him if Neha had
updated anything about Preeti's case.

505
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,330
And also Rohit, find out if they have court
permissions to obtain samples from family and friends.

506
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,250
Be on it, man.

507
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,540
I need all calls as well as the message
details of Neha and Vikram.

508
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,540
When did he meet her the last time?

509
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,500
I'll come and meet you tomorrow Vikram.

510
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,700
Nothing I am handling an important case.
Are you taking your medications on time?

511
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,290
Don't worry Shinde is there to help...

512
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,700
Track his every movement.

513
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,540
I'll get him.

514
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,580
Krishna, wait in the car.

515
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,450
Okay, sir.

516
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,790
Sir, I need to talk to Ibrahim personally.

517
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,330
One minute.

518
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,330
Who are you guys?

519
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,830
His name is Vikram, he is handling Preeti's case.

520
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,120
Sir...

521
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:55,830
Sit...

522
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,790
'Khodahafez'
(Good Bye)

523
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,040
Okay, we shall talk later.

524
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,950
Ibrahim, I need to talk to you personally.

525
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,200
Take me to your home.

526
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,500
Sure sir, let's go.

527
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,950
First finish your tea.

528
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,410
Sir come sir

529
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,410
Sir, my scooter is at the mechanic shop for a repair.

530
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,540
So, if you can wait a minute I'd like
to get my scooter back.

531
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,330
Please...

532
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,370
Rohit.

533
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,830
Hey, Fahad, is it done?

534
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,700
Yes, sir

535
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,750
You can take it.

536
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,410
Can I take it?

537
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,580
Rohit, come with him.

538
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,330
Let's go.

539
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,790
So Ibrahim, firstly I am not suspecting you in this case.

540
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,040
You can trust me on this.

541
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,540
Sir...

542
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,540
Secondly, this case is very important to me.

543
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,500
In case you missed out on any detail,
then think over and tell me.

544
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,120
No sir, this is what happened.

545
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,620
Can I look around your house?

546
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,290
Sir.

547
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,540
Ibrahim, I am sure I won't trouble you anymore

548
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,500
But you should help me as and when required.

549
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,620
Okay?

550
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,370
Sir...

551
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:44,790
Lets go

552
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,580
Sir.

553
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,250
Rohit, stop the jeep once.

554
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,290
Did you observe anything specifically?

555
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,080
No, everything is fine but...

556
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,790
No one has seen the blue colour car except him.

557
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,910
And according to Srinivas' investigation, be it ORR vehicle owners,

558
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,330
the toll booth operators, people at Wonderla,
CCTV footage...

559
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,870
nobody has seen that car.

560
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,500
And... Krishna.
-Sir

561
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,580
There are fingerprints on that, collect them carefully.
-Okay, Sir.

562
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,290
Go and collect the cigarette bud that he
threw just outside his home.

563
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,080
We can get his DNA.

564
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,950
"Bring back Preeti, bring back Preeti."

565
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,870
"Bring back Preeti, bring back Preeti."`

566
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,660
"We want justice, we want justice".

567
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,910
"Bring back Preeti, bring back Preeti."

568
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,500
"Bring back Preeti, bring back Preeti."

569
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,660
"We want justice, we want justice".

570
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,750
"We want justice, we want justice".`

571
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,040
"Bring back Preeti, bring back Preeti."

572
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
"We want...
Justice"

573
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,200
"We want...
Justice

574
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,950
"We want..."

575
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,160
So, Ajay... since how long do you know Preeti?

576
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,330
Preeti and I are very good friends from Intermediate.

577
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,160
She is also my lab partner.
-When did you see her last?

578
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,250
Just the night before she went missing.

579
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,830
We hung out at a pub with all our friends.

580
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,500
Sir, I am Preeti's best friend.

581
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,950
I am Sandhya...
-When did you last meet Preeti?

582
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,660
Just the night before the incident,
Preeti, Ajay and I went to the pub, sir.

583
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,830
She spoke to me the very next morning as well.

584
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,790
Did you talk to her on the day of the incident?

585
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,120
Yes, sir.
-What did you talk about?

586
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,950
She spoke to me when she wasn't even fully awake.

587
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,500
Does she drink?

588
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,290
No, sir.

589
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,540
Where were you the day she went missing?

590
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,910
I went to my mother's place, sir.

591
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,120
It's Arutla which is 40 k.m from B.N.Reddy

592
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,660
Ajay and Preeti, what's with them?

593
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,620
They are just friends.

594
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,950
Do you drive a car or a bike?

595
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,450
Bike sir.

596
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,620
Did you ever happen to see any one of your
friends or their parents in a blue colour sedan car?

597
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,330
No, sir.

598
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,950
As far as I remember nobody has it.

599
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,450
Anybody who would want to hurt Preeti?

600
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,540
She has friendly relations with all the students.

601
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,580
But...
-But what?

602
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:04,000
But there has been a tiff going on
between Chandramouli sir and her.

603
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,200
Did you ever see the kind of clothes
she and her friends wear?

604
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,160
They wear jeans, skirts and going around with boys.

605
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,450
And that too with a boy like Ajay.

606
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,040
He drinks and does weed.
I have seen it all, sir.

607
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,120
Okay, but what is the problem you have with Preeti, sir?

608
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,370
Isn't it because of these people that
our culture is getting ruined?

609
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:26,410
Okay.

610
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,870
When did you meet Preeti for the last time?

611
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,790
I do not remember.
-How do you come to college?

612
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,080
Why do you want to know?
-Answer

613
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,000
On a bike.

614
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,500
Do you have a car?
-Why do you want to know?

615
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:34,910
Hey....

616
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:37,910
Write down properly.

617
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,410
Write properly...

618
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,120
Yes, sir, please tell me.

619
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,700
I don't know how to drive a car.
-Krishna will collect your samples.

620
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,120
What samples?
Why should I give you?

621
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,910
For DNA?
Do you have court orders to procure the same?

622
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,950
Keeping permissions aside,
Do you have any reasons not to give us samples?

623
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,200
What reason can I have?

624
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,450
As a citizen, I know the rights I have.

625
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,830
Get the permissions...

626
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,790
Sir, how old are you?

627
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
Fifty-nine.

628
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,080
So will you live for another ten years?

629
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,790
Only you can save our culture and society.

630
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,040
Do protect it well.

631
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,790
What do you think, Rohit?

632
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,790
Ibrahim, obviously.

633
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,790
Ajay and Chandramouli?

634
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,580
You can avoid Chandramouli.

635
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,290
How can we leave him?
He was resisting to give us samples and he has a motive too.

636
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,410
He is just a pain in the A**.

637
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,450
He is a great man born to save the culture of our country.

638
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,660
Anyway, there are a lot of people like him roaming in the city.

639
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,950
Keep Sandhya in the watch-list.

640
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,830
Generally, girls of that age do not come forward to help.

641
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,450
Also, they have been to a pub just the night before.

642
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,500
We need to know what happened at the pub that night.

643
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,750
Get someone to tail Sandhya and Ajay.

644
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:51,250
Did you ask Shinde, if Neha spoke anything about Preeti's case?

645
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,540
It seems she spoke nothing about it.

646
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:58,910
F***

647
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,750
Why, Abhilash?

648
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,580
Why are you wasting your time, man?

649
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,700
What is this sudden interest of yours in Preeti's case?

650
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,000
It's none of your business.

651
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,910
I will definitely make you answer everything soon.

652
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,500
Go...

653
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,580
Can you tell me exactly what happened
just the day before Preethi went missing?

654
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,200
As usual, she went to her college in the
morning and came back in the evening.

655
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:43,080
After sometime she got ready and
went out with her friends to a party.

656
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,700
With whom?

657
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,290
With her college friends.

658
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,410
What happened the next day morning?

659
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,330
She woke up a little late that morning.

660
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,040
She had her breakfast and watched TV for a while.

661
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,450
She went to Saraswati's orphanage in the afternoon.

662
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,660
What is this orphanage?

663
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,290
Excuse me...

664
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,040
Who is this?
-We called you earlier to talk about Preeti.

665
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah, tell me...

666
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,410
What kind of a girl is Preeti?

667
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,040
Preeti is a very nice girl.
This shouldn't have happened.

668
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,450
I am in constant touch with Mohan and Lakshmi.

669
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,160
Somehow or the other, please get her back to safely.

670
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,080
She is maintaining an orphanage.

671
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,700
From the time her parents died...
-Wait...

672
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,080
Aren't you Preeti's parents?
-No, sir.

673
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,580
Nobody knows who are Preeti's
biological parents.

674
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,450
My brother Shiva and his wife Priya adopted Preeti and took her to US.

675
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,410
Unfortunately they both died in a car crash.

676
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,160
Since then Preeti has been living with us.

677
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:41,870
My brother used to send money for the
maintenance of the orphanage out of good will.

678
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,250
After his death, we took up the responsibility.

679
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,700
Preeti has been maintaining it for the past few years.

680
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,200
We have heard that Preeti gives money to this orphanage every month.

681
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,750
Yes.

682
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,790
Most of the maintenance of this
orphanage happens with the money she gives.

683
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,410
Do you give information to Preeti on how the money is utilised?

684
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:56,950
No, sir.

685
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,450
Preeti trusts me completely.

686
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,290
As she grew here in my care.

687
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:04,000
Even the adoption process of Preeti by
Shiva and Priya happened under my watch.

688
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,700
Please look into why that girl is crying.

689
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:12,330
She is crying because she is going to be adopted today.

690
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,750
Hey,

691
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,830
Come here.

692
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,750
After that she came home and relaxed for
some time in her bedroom.

693
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,370
She got dressed and went out saying
that she is going to meet her friends.

694
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,700
She called me from Ibrahim's phone
saying that her car broke down and she asked me to pick her up.

695
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:26,950
That was the last...

696
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,040
How is her relationship with the neighbours?

697
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,370
Sheila is our neighbour.

698
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,540
Preeti and Sheila are very close friends.

699
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,450
Excuse me!

700
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,910
She is my close friend, sir.

701
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,500
We both run a food blog online as well.

702
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,250
Apart from her, no one in the colony communicates with me.
-Why?

703
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,870
I am a divorcee, sir.

704
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,080
It's a stigma in this society.

705
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,540
When did you last meet Preeti?

706
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:55,370
At times, she invites me to parties to go along with her friends.

707
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,700
I think just the day before,
she called me and invited me to the party.

708
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,700
I had a headache and dozed off at home, sir.

709
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,370
Where were you the day Preeti went missing?

710
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,290
My daughter's visitation was on that day, sir.

711
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,910
My ex-husband brought her to Krishnakanth's park in the city.

712
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,370
Can we call your husband to re-check?

713
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,080
Ex-husband, sir.
-That's what, can we call him?

714
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,620
Yeah sir, but...
-Don't get tensed as it's a common practice.

715
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,200
If we have proof that you are at some other place during the time of the crime,
we can do our investigation correctly.

716
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,120
That's about it.
-Okay, sir.

717
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,160
Sir, you told us that your brother and his wife died in a car accident, right?

718
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:33,910
Yes.

719
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,000
So what happened to the properties and money earned in the US?

720
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,250
Until the time Preeti was eighteen years old, I was in charge.

721
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,910
Just a few months back,
all that has been transferred in her name.

722
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,450
Okay.

723
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,660
Rohit...

724
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,750
Preeti's parents, right?

725
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,950
I've already added them to the suspect list.

726
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,660
So, Is this only route Preeti can take to enter ORR.

727
00:48:58,830 --> 00:48:59,290
Yes.

728
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,870
The pattern on this tyre and the one there is not the same, Rohit.

729
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,200
Find out with the landowners if some other trucks come here usually.

730
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,120
Okay.

731
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,290
Preeti is a very normal girl leading a happy life.

732
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,700
Why would anyone want to hurt a girl like her?

733
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,410
Though initially, I took over the case for Neha,
now it's getting more personal.

734
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,910
The more I am getting to know about Preeti,
I am getting very emotionally attached, Rohit.

735
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,000
We have to get back Preeti and Neha safely.

736
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,790
Thanks, Krishna.
-Sir.

737
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,450
Chain of custody is in Rohit's dairy.

738
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,160
Okay sir

739
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,700
Okay Vikram, I shall leave too.
-My car is here.

740
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,450
Rohit...

741
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,160
We have to go out in the evening.
Find out exactly which pub Preeti went to.

742
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,330
We are going there in the evening.

743
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,750
Get Swapna along, so that we can blend easily with the crowd.
-Okay.

744
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,830
I need to ask you something.

745
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,620
Yes, ask me.

746
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,540
Did you ever imagine kissing me before you proposed to me?

747
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,620
Tell me the truth.

748
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,040
Shut up, Dude.

749
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,370
Hey, tell me.
-I will tell you, if you tell me.

750
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,000
Do you remember I came for
the depixelation of Moosapet hit and run case.

751
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,700
Hey, shut up, please ...

752
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,330
I liked you the very moment.

753
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:00,040
Once after coming back home,
I was remembering you and I saw your display picture.

754
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,000
The first time I saw your lips, I couldn't control.

755
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,540
Hey, you didn't even know me properly back then.

756
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,660
Boys are like that.

757
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,290
If they like someone they start imagining stuff.

758
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,160
Tell me about you.

759
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,700
Neha,

760
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,500
Oh shit...! Vikram...

761
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:20,950
Vikram, quick.

762
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,370
Come here once.

763
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,620
Vikram, go get some water.

764
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,830
Why are you still standing there?

765
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:35,540
Go!

766
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,580
Hi...

767
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,870
I am sorry for what happened.

768
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,040
Will you have a drink?

769
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,200
I am not supposed to...

770
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,620
Rohit... come.

771
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,370
club regulars, bartenders, cleaning staff...
Observe everyone carefully.

772
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,700
If you get any kind of lead, text me immediately.

773
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,660
And did you find any CCTV camera inside?

774
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,830
I will check.

775
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,870
Collect the entire footage from the
time Preeti entered this pub to the time she left.

776
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,290
And I can see that there are cameras in the parking and valet

777
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,580
Collect that footage too.

778
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,580
Okay
-Let's go.

779
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,620
One minute.

780
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:16,950
Sir...

781
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,750
Come there, I need to talk to you.
-Ok, Sir.

782
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:25,620
Tell me, sir.

783
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,330
I am from the police department.
I need to talk something...

784
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,200
Here Preeti...

785
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,450
Hey Rohit, Rohit...

786
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:50,950
Hey...

787
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:52,500
Hey...

788
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,330
Take the gun...?
-No.

789
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,160
Brother... Brother...

790
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,160
Hey, who are you?

791
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,870
Come here...

792
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:03,700
Where...?

793
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,450
Tell me where...?

794
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,830
Where ?

795
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,410
Sir, it's in my pocket.
-Pocket?

796
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,700
What pocket?

797
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,120
It's in my jeans pocket.

798
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,200
F***

799
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,790
Sir...

800
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:24,870
Do you know who this girl is?

801
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,080
No, sir.

802
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,040
Look closely...
Do you know who this girl is?

803
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,290
She is a regular at this club, sir

804
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,700
With Ajay's group.

805
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,540
Sir, but I don't know her well.

806
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,000
We accidentally busted narcotics in the old city.

807
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,160
Come and recover it.

808
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,160
I am telling you, it was accidental, right?

809
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,540
If you are not interested, I will let him go.

810
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,040
Sir...
-Hey, down... down.

811
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
Come and recover it from Rohit.

812
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,540
Rohit, take care of him.

813
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,620
Sir, do one thing.

814
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,660
Arrange for a pooja (Ritual) at your home

815
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,620
What pooja sir?

816
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,120
To get back your daughter safely,
arrange some kind of a pooja at your home.

817
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,160
What is this, sir?

818
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,410
Sir, trust me if you want your daughter
back safely, do this.

819
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,660
Call everyone. Invite all your friends,
family circle, even Preeti's friends and all.

820
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,660
And hand over the list of invitees to Rohit.

821
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,580
And most importantly this should happen tomorrow.

822
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,250
Don't delay it.

823
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,250
Take care Rohit.

824
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,200
Why this pooja now, Vikram?

825
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,580
Rohit, do you think whoever kidnapped Preeti
will attend this pooja in her very own home?

826
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,500
No, he won't come.

827
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,450
Good, that is what I want.

828
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,040
Please make a list of all the people who do not attend this event.

829
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,910
What about the kidnapper attends?
-Yes, I want that too.

830
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,160
If the kidnapper attends this,
I am sure he will leave a clue behind for me to trace.

831
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,040
In cases like these, culprits are usually in the family circle.

832
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,120
This pooja is a good opportunity for us,

833
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:50,290
to observe our suspects and also to add to the list of suspects.

834
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,040
See you tomorrow.

835
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:54,750
Rohit, what about Neha's call list?

836
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:56,500
We'll get it by evening.

837
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,700
Pub CCTV footage?

838
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,410
I already have it, the head office is looking into it.

839
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,540
Okay, you keep the list ready.
-Okay.

840
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,870
Mohan Sir..

841
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,750
Please come with me, sir.

842
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,000
What happened?
-Sir, please come

843
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,830
What happened?

844
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,620
Please come with me once.

845
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,290
Please, please, come.

846
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,410
Sir, the letter... it was here...

847
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:59,370
As I was coming out, someone... kept it here.

848
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,410
Your name is written on it.

849
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,790
"Dead body is in front"

850
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:04,870
Dead body?

851
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,620
Whose dead body is it?

852
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,620
Is it our Preeti's?

853
01:00:56,790 --> 01:01:00,250
Just a minute Lakshmi, I don't think it's Preeti's.
If it is Preeti's, why would they write Vikram's name?

854
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,910
Did you eat?

855
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,870
Oye, Hero.

856
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,540
Do you want anything to eat?

857
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,250
Sushmi, will you have an omelette?
-Yes.

858
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,410
They came again in the morning.

859
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:06,330
After you left in the morning,
they both were watching from there.

860
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,830
Ramesh...

861
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,000
Ramesh...
-Yes, sir

862
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,790
Did you see anyone peeping into our house?

863
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,410
No, sir.

864
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:26,580
Anytime in the afternoon after I left?
-No, I haven't seen anyone, sir.

865
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,000
Sushmi, did you take your tablet?

866
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,410
This is not because of my tablets, Vikram.

867
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,700
First, take your tablet.

868
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,450
Don't you understand that this is not
because of my tablets.

869
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,080
Where?

870
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,450
Not now, try and understand, please.

871
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,830
You have to come with me to the station, Vikram.

872
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,370
I have been waiting for this moment for a long time now.

873
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,120
Hey moron, you are handling this
case in a wrong direction.

874
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,080
Neha is my girlfriend.

875
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,290
Are you out of your f***ing mind?

876
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,450
Hey, take your hands off my collar.

877
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:20,370
Leave me.

878
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:21,910
Bloody idiots.

879
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:22,750
Sir, this guy...
-Abhilash...

880
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,160
This is not the way
to question Vikram.

881
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,000
Is he leaving the city and running away?

882
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,620
Vikram, out.

883
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,450
Vikram...

884
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,410
Rohit is leading a search party
behind Raju's guest house.

885
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:35,950
Go and check it.
-Thank you, sir.

886
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,830
This is not correct, sir.

887
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:39,910
Don't say a word, Abhilash.

888
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:42,370
I did a grave mistake by assigning you Neha's case.

889
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,790
You are more focused on Vikram than Neha.

890
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,620
Hey Vikram...

891
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:49,910
How are you coping up?

892
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,120
Yeah, fine.

893
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,200
Are you taking your pills?

894
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,250
No, it's making me numb.

895
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:57,660
Sir, I am sure Vikram is involved in Neha disappearance.

896
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,830
Vikram is now handling not
only Preeti's case but also Neha's.

897
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:03,830
Rohit had briefed me on this.
You will drop Neha's case immediately.

898
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:04,750
Sir
-Your done

899
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,830
Did you find anything?
-Not yet.

900
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,200
Even the cadaver dogs are working.

901
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,410
It's been five hours that I was at the hospital.

902
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:21,160
What the f**k are you guys doing, man?

903
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,700
I am trying, Vikram

904
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:23,620
Trying...?

905
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,950
We don't even know whether the body
that we are about to find is Preeti's or Neha's.

906
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,120
Just trying will not do.
Go and pressurise them.

907
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,120
I am going to the forensics.
Wrap this up and be there.

908
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,700
Okay.

909
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,620
And also Rohit, compare the mud samples
from the cars tyres, bike tyres...

910
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,330
shoes of the people in our suspects list
with the mud samples of this place.

911
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,200
And if there is a match, update me.

912
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,040
Also if their phones have any live tracking,
check if they have been here and let me know.

913
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:41,450
Okay.

914
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,500
Vikram, this is Anirudh.
He is a handwriting analyst.

915
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,080
Anirudh tell me one thing...

916
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:51,080
Can we compare the handwriting of this
note with that of the suspects' handwritings...

917
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,660
And tell me if any of my suspects wrote this?

918
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,330
Whoever has written this has intentionally
written in small strokes.

919
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,700
This is not natural handwriting.

920
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,250
It's a very peculiar note Vikram.

921
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,950
Did you find any finger prints on the note?

922
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,580
I have emailed you all the reports.

923
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,000
Sheila's and Preeti's fathers prints have been detected.

924
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,580
Because they handled the note at the crime scene.

925
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,830
And also your prints have been detected.

926
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,330
You didn't wear gloves, I believe.

927
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,410
No unknown prints have been detected.

928
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,830
Whoever did this, has done it neatly.

929
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:15,910
Here is Neha's call list.

930
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,870
Do you have any information from the cars
that travelled on the ORR?

931
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:26,790
I think I spoke to about fifty drivers who passed by that time.

932
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:32,330
Some mentioned about seeing a Mini Cooper
but nobody spoke of a blue car.

933
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,870
What about the tyre marks at Preeti's house?

934
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,540
I spoke to the land owners.

935
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:39,830
They said that water tankers come to
water the bricks and they are those marks.

936
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,700
Nothing looks suspicious here as well.

937
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,160
Sheila, can you tell me how exactly
on how you found the note?

938
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:59,250
Just as I was coming to Preeti's house for attending the pooja,
I saw the note at the main door.

939
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:04,790
Initially I thought it was a
marketing pamphlet left by sales agents.

940
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:09,200
But as the note was white and clear, it caught my attention.

941
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,620
And I took it in my hands, sir.

942
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,910
I was very scared after reading it.

943
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:20,870
And I came running to Preeti's father,
Mohan to tell him about this.

944
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,410
Did you paint this , Sheila?

945
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:25,830
Yes, sir.

946
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,660
It's good, can I take a picture of this?

947
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,250
Yeah, sure.

948
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:33,580
Can you compare the strokes of this painting
with the note and confirm if the same person did it?

949
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,500
I can, but...
-But what?

950
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,120
If I can get the original painting, I can confirm, sir.

951
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,870
I cannot get you the original painting, Anirudh.

952
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,790
Tell me what can be done with this.

953
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,540
Sure, sir.

954
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:45,200
All I am saying is, that I cannot tell you concretely.

955
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,830
I can tell you for sure if they don't match.

956
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,500
But if they match, I can only say that there
are chances that it's done by the same person.

957
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,330
Done... at least we can rule out Sheila.

958
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:00,790
Sir, positive.

959
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,370
This note could have been written by Sheila.

960
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,790
This is the note that you gave me...

961
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:06,330
and this is the picture of Sheila's painting.

962
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,080
There are very few differences between the two samples, sir.

963
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,500
Please do observe the individual stroke length
and the gap between them.

964
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,450
There is too much similarity.

965
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,160
So, it is Sheila then.

966
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,660
But we cannot vouch for it a hundred percent, Vikram.
-Yeah.

967
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:20,250
But there is a good chance.
-Should I apply for a search warrant?

968
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,540
If she is the culprit, we can definitely
find a clue in her house.

969
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:31,410
Sir, why are your searching my house?

970
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,330
Preeti spent a lot of time at your house, isn't it?

971
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,500
So maybe we can find some clues
or evidences that will help our investigation.

972
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,370
Nothing to worry.

973
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,290
Vikram..

974
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:46,160
Sheila, you will have to come to our branch office once.

975
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,580
We have some more questions to ask you.

976
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,290
And...get your car keys once.

977
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,580
Okay, sir

978
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,540
Rohit will coordinate the time with you.

979
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:15,080
And please come as soon as possible
-Okay sir

980
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,620
Whose car is this?
-It's mine, sir

981
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,000
But I didn't see this the last time I came here.

982
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,450
I had given it for servicing.

983
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,040
Rohit, get the cover off.

984
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,870
Please get this car's keys also.

985
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,790
Okay, sir.

986
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,120
Practice notes...

987
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,290
Arrest her.

988
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,750
Sir, I will tell you what happened.

989
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,790
Sir, please, sir
Sir, please ...

990
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,330
Sir, I will tell you what happened.

991
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,700
Sir, please, sir.

992
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,700
Tell me Sheila...

993
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,410
What did you do with Preeti and Neha?

994
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:26,500
Who is this Neha, sir?

995
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,790
I don't know anything about her.

996
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:29,750
I will not ask you again.

997
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:30,870
Whom did you kill?

998
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,200
And what did you do with the dead body?

999
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:36,250
Sir, I am really very scared...

1000
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,290
Sir, I did write the note...

1001
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:46,250
but I have absolutely no connection
with Preeti's missing.

1002
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,250
And who is this Neha?

1003
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,700
Trust me, I don't know anything.

1004
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:51,750
Then why did you write the note?

1005
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,370
Sir, I am a divorcee...

1006
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,660
Except for Preeti, no one in the
colony communicates with me.

1007
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,660
I felt very lonely after Preeti went missing, sir.

1008
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:04,500
I know that you are investigating her case.

1009
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,200
I thought I will get some attention in the colony
if I provide you with a prime clue.

1010
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,160
So I wrote the note.

1011
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:10,870
Bullshit!

1012
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:12,790
It's the truth, sir.
-Shut up, Sheila!

1013
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,910
Do you know how stupid this sounds?

1014
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,450
Sir, I am stating the truth.

1015
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:20,700
I don't know what happened to Preeti.
And I don't even know who Neha is.

1016
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,410
Take care.

1017
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,450
Vikram sir is not a good man.

1018
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,450
His treatment is very harsh.

1019
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,660
All this third degree is very painful, Sheila.

1020
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,410
Trust me, okay!

1021
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:50,660
If you have anything to say, tell me.
I will take care of it.

1022
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,620
All we want to know is, "What happened?"
And that's about it.

1023
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,000
Sir...

1024
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,790
I swear, I don't know anything.

1025
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,080
I am telling the truth.

1026
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,250
Believe me, sir.

1027
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,160
Did she tell you anything?

1028
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,080
No.

1029
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,370
What should we do next?

1030
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,830
I am sure she is lying, Rohit.

1031
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:27,370
But if she is right, there are
chances that Preeti and Neha are safe.

1032
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,950
So we have to know if she is lying to us or stating the fact.

1033
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,500
Arrange for a polygraph.

1034
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,330
We need her consent for it, Vikram.

1035
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,830
Otherwise there will be legal issues.

1036
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,120
I will manipulate Sheila.

1037
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,370
I am sure she will agree for Polygraph.

1038
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:44,700
By the way, we tried to match the mud samples from
Raju's guest house with those of the suspects.

1039
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,500
But there's no match.

1040
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,080
Same with maps data as well.

1041
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,160
Sheila was not in our suspect list back then, right?

1042
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,830
No.

1043
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:54,620
Anyways, take samples from Sheila's shoes
and both her cars' tyres and see if they match.

1044
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:58,790
Also call the forensics to comb her car's for trace evidence.

1045
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,910
We might find some evidence related to Preeti.

1046
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,330
Find out if this is the blue colour car which Ibrahim saw.

1047
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,660
Okay, I'll find out.

1048
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,450
Did she confess?

1049
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:21,620
I've arranged for a Polygraph.

1050
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,540
What about the consent?

1051
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,500
She will give...

1052
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,410
Okay, good.

1053
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,160
Keep updating me.
-Sir.

1054
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,410
I don't want any trouble.

1055
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:28,700
Everything by the book.
-Yes, sir

1056
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,950
Sheila, this is a Polygraph, a lie detector.

1057
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:45,250
If I got to trust you that you are innocent
then you have to get this test done.

1058
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,540
Do I have your permission?

1059
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:51,950
If you say no my suspicion will increase.

1060
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,950
I will anyways get a permission and test you.

1061
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,620
Do I have your consent?

1062
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,370
Yes, sir.

1063
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,580
Take her signature on the consent letter
and start the procedure.

1064
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:14,620
She is already nervous, please advice her to relax.

1065
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,910
Sheila if your are tensed, the results won't be accurate.

1066
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,950
Take a deep breath and relax.

1067
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,040
Only answer me the truth for the questions asked.

1068
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:22,870
Okay, sir.

1069
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,620
Is your name Sheila?

1070
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,290
Yes, sir.

1071
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,580
Are you thirty years old?
-Yes, sir.

1072
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,580
Is Vijay your ex-husband.

1073
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:42,580
Yes, sir.

1074
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,580
Sheila, do you know Preeti?

1075
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:47,700
Yes, sir.

1076
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,450
Sheila, did you kidnap Preeti?

1077
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:02,250
Sheila, I am asking you....
Did you kidnap Preeti?

1078
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,040
I am asking you something.

1079
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,120
No, sir

1080
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,450
Sheila, do you know who Neha is?

1081
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:15,500
No, sir.

1082
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,830
Sheila, is Neha still alive?
-I don't know who Neha is.

1083
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:22,950
She is not lying, sir.

1084
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,290
But clearly her heart rate fluctuated
when asked about Preeti and Neha.

1085
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,540
It's normal, sir.

1086
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:31,200
That's because she knows that questions about Preeti
and Neha are very important in this Polygraph test.

1087
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,330
When she answered the questions, her pulse stabilised, sir.

1088
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:35,040
Same with the GSR and respiration too.

1089
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,120
With the experience that I have, she is telling us the truth.

1090
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:42,120
To me, it looks like she was trying to cheat Polygraph.

1091
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:43,120
Sir...?

1092
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:47,330
Some people have to ability to control
their breathing and heart rate cheat the Polygraph.

1093
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,790
To me it looks like that.

1094
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,040
Moreover, I cannot take any chances.

1095
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,620
If there is a re-test, I will call you.
-Sure, sir

1096
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,250
Thank you.

1097
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:57,750
Rohit...

1098
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,500
Arrange for a Narco test.
-Are you serious?

1099
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:00,910
Yeah.

1100
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:02,580
You know that it take a long time to get permissions.

1101
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,330
And you know it's a complicated process.

1102
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:07,620
Go and explain Judge Mr Lakshman Rao
about Preeti's missing case.

1103
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,790
And tell him that I've personally asked for help.

1104
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:09,750
Okay.

1105
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:12,750
And also Rohit...

1106
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:17,950
Go to Sheela's house and collect the soil samples from her car
and compare with Raju guest house soil.

1107
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,450
I am sorry.

1108
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,160
Vikram....

1109
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,120
She is fighting it.

1110
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:41,120
Sheila, don't fight it.

1111
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,620
Let it...

1112
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:44,580
Sheila...

1113
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,830
Sheila, can you hear me?

1114
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,540
Shake her...

1115
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:50,750
Sheila...

1116
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,200
Sheila...

1117
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,160
Did you kidnap Preeti?

1118
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,700
I can hear you.

1119
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,040
Shake her once again.

1120
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,120
Sheila...

1121
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:06,870
Sheila...

1122
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,160
I can hear you.

1123
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,950
Sheila, did you kidnap Preeti?

1124
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:13,370
Sad.....Preeti....

1125
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,910
Check her vitals...
-Yes sir

1126
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:17,370
Sad.....Preeti....

1127
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,330
I think the dosage is high for her.
She may not respond.

1128
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,330
Neha...

1129
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,000
Sheila... Sheila... Sheila...
What about Neha?

1130
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,540
Vikram!

1131
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,370
What about Neha?

1132
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:27,830
Vikram!

1133
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,250
Tell me, tell me.....
What about Neha?

1134
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:29,910
Vikram, stop it I say.

1135
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:30,620
What about Neha?

1136
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,580
Vikram, stop it I say.
-First, get out.....

1137
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,540
Get out of here, first.

1138
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,830
Let me ask her man!

1139
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:36,410
Vikram, what's wrong with you?

1140
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,620
This is going out of control, Rohit.

1141
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,200
Did you hear that?
she is speaking about Neha even without asking her.

1142
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:43,500
I am damn sure she is involved.

1143
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,410
You asked about Neha yesterday...

1144
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,120
So she must've remembered subconsciously.

1145
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,250
It's a possibility, right?

1146
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,200
Vikram, don't call me for the narco test from next time on.

1147
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:58,250
Don't you know that it will be a bad remark
on me if anything happens to the subject?

1148
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:00,250
Stupids!

1149
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,540
Did you conduct narco?

1150
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,080
Come to my office.

1151
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:26,770
Look...

1152
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,850
I like your intelligence.

1153
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:31,150
But don't use that for your advantage.

1154
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,560
If you do something like this ever again
without my knowledge, I will simply bury you!

1155
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:36,940
Got it?

1156
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,480
Out...

1157
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,100
Send some tea for me.

1158
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:54,690
Ibrahim...

1159
01:19:58,690 --> 01:19:59,230
Hello...

1160
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,150
Tell me, Ibrahim.

1161
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:03,650
As told, I have come to see Sheila's blue colour car.

1162
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:09,020
But the blue colour car that I saw on the
ORR and this car, are not the same, sir.

1163
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,100
Got a call from the forensics...

1164
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:18,810
We did not find any trace evidence related to Preeti in Sheila's car.

1165
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,980
Hello...

1166
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:23,480
Tell me...

1167
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,230
What?

1168
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:31,310
Vikram, they found a decomposed
body behind Raju's guest house.

1169
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,770
It's not in an identifiable state.

1170
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,730
Are you ok ?

1171
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,810
Vikram...Vikram...

1172
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,270
Sushmi...

1173
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,650
Sushmi...

1174
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,650
Hey, no....

1175
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:41,100
Sushmi...

1176
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:43,060
Hey, no...

1177
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,190
I'm afraid, Vikram

1178
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,150
Hey, no....

1179
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:11,730
Neha... is de...

1180
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:30,560
Rohit...

1181
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:32,440
that body is ...

1182
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,190
Send her to forensics and find out
whether it's Preeti or Neha.

1183
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:43,400
Tell me.

1184
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,850
Okay.

1185
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:48,600
Okay.

1186
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:49,310
Vikram...

1187
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:53,400
The mud samples from Sheila's car
match with the mud samples here.

1188
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,100
So, she was here.

1189
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,350
Tell me whose dead body is it.

1190
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:13,560
Sir...

1191
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,770
Is it Preeti's?

1192
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:17,810
Or Neha's?

1193
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,940
What dead body, sir?

1194
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:21,480
Shut up.

1195
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:23,020
Don't irritate me...

1196
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:25,020
We found a dead body in the exact location you told us about.

1197
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:27,310
So, tell me why did you do all this?
-Sir...

1198
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,100
Sheila, tell me.

1199
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,690
Sir, I have no clue, sir.

1200
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:34,440
Believe me, sir, I don't know anything.
Please...

1201
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,400
Constables.

1202
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:36,810
Constables...

1203
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:37,770
Sir...

1204
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,690
Start the third-degree.

1205
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:41,940
Sir, I don't know anything.

1206
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:54,980
Hello, Rohit...

1207
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,980
The forensics called in...

1208
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:58,980
it's Preeti!

1209
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,900
She is just an eighteen year old girl.

1210
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,020
How could you kill her?

1211
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,020
Sir, I did not kill her.

1212
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,600
Trust me, sir.

1213
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,690
I really don't know anything, sir.

1214
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,440
This can stop now.

1215
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:36,810
If you just tell me where Neha is.

1216
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:40,270
Sir, I don't know who Neha is.

1217
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,980
I swear I don't know who Neha is.

1218
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:48,060
Constables...

1219
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,900
Sir, please...

1220
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,020
Sir, no...

1221
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,600
Sir, no...

1222
01:25:58,940 --> 01:25:59,850
Please no.

1223
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,730
Vikram, call for you, from the forensics.

1224
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,980
Hello, tell me Shinde.

1225
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,650
Vikram...

1226
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:10,230
We analysed Preeti's dead body for trace evidence.

1227
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:12,270
We found DNA from her fingernails.

1228
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,100
Is it Sheila's?

1229
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:13,810
No.

1230
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,190
It's Ajay's!

1231
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:15,600
What?

1232
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,520
Ajay's DNA is on Preeti.

1233
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:30,850
Something is wrong.

1234
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,770
Go and get Ajay immediately.
-Okay.

1235
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:37,940
Hey, keep quiet.

1236
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:45,480
I got to know what you and Ajay did to Preeti.

1237
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,560
What is with Ajay, sir?

1238
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:49,100
It's been a long time since I met Ajay.

1239
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,980
You are unnecessarily getting me involved.

1240
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,850
I really don't know any of this.

1241
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,230
Ajay is missing.

1242
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:05,560
I told you to keep an eye on him.

1243
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,600
How can you be so irresponsible?

1244
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,270
There is an informer who is tracking him.

1245
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,900
His phone is not reachable either.

1246
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,150
I messaged him.

1247
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,440
He will definitely reply to me soon.

1248
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:15,690
Don't stress.

1249
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,190
Hello, who is this?

1250
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:21,980
I am a little busy now.

1251
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:25,810
Tell me Shinde.

1252
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:28,150
We found one more DNA on Preeti's teeth.

1253
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:28,810
Whose is it?

1254
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:29,810
It is Preeti's fathers' DNA.

1255
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:35,190
And one more thing...
we spotted a grey hair on Preeti's thigh.

1256
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:37,940
And when we analysed the DNA, it matches with Sarawati.

1257
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,480
Mohan's DNA has been found on Preeti's teeth...

1258
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:52,690
and Sarawati's hair on her body.

1259
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,350
Seems like...

1260
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,270
Seems like they formed a syndicate to kill her.

1261
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:11,560
Call them.

1262
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:15,190
Call everyone and say that it's a general investigation.

1263
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:16,270
Did you find Ajay?

1264
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:17,190
I didn't get any message as yet.

1265
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:18,810
Send the constables.

1266
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:22,980
He told us about his place Arutla,
so send some constables there.

1267
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,400
And get him here.

1268
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:40,730
Vikram...

1269
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,230
Mohan, Lakshmi and Sarawati are in holding ourselves.

1270
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,810
Did they resist?
-No

1271
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,770
What about Ajay?
-My messenger is not reachable

1272
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,310
Something feels wrong, Rohit.

1273
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:53,400
Ajay is in Vikarabad.

1274
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,980
Is your Messenger still there?
-Yeah, he's there only.

1275
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:57,600
Don't miss that Bas***

1276
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:04,850
When did he come here?

1277
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,730
He started today morning on his bike.

1278
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,400
I tailed him with great effort, Rohit.

1279
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,100
Did he come all by himself?

1280
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:10,940
He came alone.

1281
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,270
We have to get into that hut, Rohit.

1282
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,020
We can get in from behind.

1283
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:16,730
We have to get in before his finishes his smoke.

1284
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:51,650
Rohit...

1285
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,060
Sir... Sir, who is it?

1286
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:07,150
What are you guys doing here?

1287
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,270
Arvind, go back.
-Ajay, what happened?

1288
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:09,230
Go back, go back.

1289
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:10,060
Catch him.

1290
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:10,650
Go back.

1291
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:12,980
What are you guys doing here?

1292
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:13,770
Sir...

1293
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:15,940
Look Ajay, I have absolutely no patience right now.

1294
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:17,850
So tell me...
What are you guys doing here?

1295
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:20,900
Sorry sir, I lied to you.
Preeti is my girlfriend.

1296
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,480
As she is nowhere to be found for the past few days.
I just wanted to...

1297
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,190
Remove your shirt.

1298
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:34,400
Sir?

1299
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,400
Remove your shirt.

1300
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,480
Why, sir?

1301
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:37,600
Sir...

1302
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:38,600
Remove it.

1303
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:39,690
Sir.

1304
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:41,310
Sir.

1305
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:42,940
Turn around.

1306
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,270
What is this?

1307
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,770
Sir... I got hurt when I was a kid.
-What?

1308
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:54,940
Rohit...

1309
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:04,810
Preeti is dead.

1310
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,100
Lakshmi...

1311
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,270
We found your DNA on Preeti's teeth.

1312
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,310
What are you talking...?

1313
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,940
Do you say that I killed my own daughter?

1314
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:00,940
What is this Rohit?

1315
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:04,940
I am unable to find one single
motive from these people.

1316
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,400
We gathered so many pieces of evidence.

1317
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:09,600
But we are unable to get that
one solid breakthrough in this case.

1318
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,440
Hello,
-Sir

1319
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,690
Am I speaking to Vikram?

1320
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:09,440
Who is this?

1321
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,520
My name is Lata, sir

1322
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:11,230
Go on...

1323
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:15,020
I was driving on the ORR and
I pulled over when I got a phone call.

1324
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,850
Suddenly another car came and
stopped right beside my car.

1325
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:20,190
He signalled me to roll down my car window.

1326
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:24,310
I read in the newspaper that
a teenage girl has been kidnapped in this area.

1327
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:26,310
I got scared and started driving.

1328
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,810
He followed me, sir

1329
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,270
And I went to a police station in the next exist.
They gave me your number.

1330
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:32,150
Where are you now?

1331
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:36,850
I am near Raviryal exit, in front of Wonderla.

1332
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,650
Can you see a stall in front Wonderla?

1333
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:39,940
Wait there.
I am coming to you.

1334
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:40,690
Okay, sir.

1335
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,230
Hello, Rohit.

1336
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:48,900
What is the colour of the car?
-It's a white colour Ambassador.

1337
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:49,980
How does he look like?

1338
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:53,940
He is fair, but couldn't judge his height as
he was sitting inside the car.

1339
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,940
He wore black glasses and a black cap.

1340
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:57,810
He asked me to roll down my car's window pane.

1341
01:33:57,810 --> 01:33:58,770
But I did not do it.

1342
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:00,770
After that, he started shouting at me.

1343
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:05,650
"Get down, I have to talk to you",
he said something like that.

1344
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,560
He followed me.

1345
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:13,350
But as I drove faster and looked back after a minute,
he was nowhere to be seen.

1346
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:17,980
Can you come to our office and
explain his features to our sketch artist?

1347
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:18,730
Okay, sir.

1348
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:20,270
Please give your keys to Rohit.

1349
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,520
Rohit, you get her car and I shall take Lata along with me.

1350
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,770
Lata, please wait here while
I'll collect the footage from the toll booth.

1351
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:28,400
Okay, sir.

1352
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,480
Hey, what is your name?
-Yadagiri.

1353
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,350
I need today morning's CCTV footage.
-Who are you?

1354
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:36,690
Police department.

1355
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:37,650
Okay, sir

1356
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:38,980
Which timeframe do you want sir?
-Get me morning's footage.

1357
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,060
This one.

1358
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:42,310
You guys carry on.
I'll come back.

1359
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,980
Rohit, connect this Hard disk.

1360
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,150
Open the footage from around 8:30, morning.

1361
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,810
Lata called me at 9:30 am.

1362
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:52,560
So play the footage from 8:30 am and
pause if you see a white colour Ambassador car.

1363
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,520
Since he followed her...

1364
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:58,690
he must have gone through the same
toll exit or continued on the same road.

1365
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:00,770
I am sure you will find it in any of those two footages.

1366
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,810
Lata, are you sure you saw a white Ambassador car?

1367
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:27,350
Yes, sir.

1368
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,400
White Ambassador.

1369
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,270
Sir.

1370
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,020
No, sir.

1371
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:44,100
Except for the cap and sunglasses,
nothing else matches.

1372
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,230
Can you stay for two more hours?

1373
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,150
I'll get another good sketch artist.

1374
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:53,060
It is already late, sir.
My mother has already called me three times.

1375
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:55,980
Raghu...

1376
01:35:58,150 --> 01:35:58,730
Sir...

1377
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:00,600
Drop madam at her home.

1378
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,190
And don't pay any money for his auto fare.

1379
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:02,650
Ok Sir.

1380
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:03,810
You can come in the morning.

1381
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:05,560
Please sit on the other side.
-Okay, madam.

1382
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,100
Something is wrong, Rohit.

1383
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,440
Car had followed her.

1384
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,810
It neither took an exit at the toll nor it continued on the ORR?
Where did the car disappear?

1385
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:12,020
Keep playing the footage.

1386
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:20,770
Pause, pause.

1387
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:25,100
Rewind that a little.

1388
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:26,730
Pause.

1389
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:44,150
Play it...

1390
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,350
Play the footage of the day when Preeti went missing.

1391
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:50,770
Pause.

1392
01:36:51,810 --> 01:36:53,810
As per the reports, when did Ibrahim
see Preeti for the last time?

1393
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:55,560
6 pm.

1394
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:58,810
Look at this truck, it came out exactly after half an hour.

1395
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:03,770
And Lata called me in the morning at 9:30 am
and exactly after half an hour this truck came out.

1396
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:06,270
Though the number plates vary,
the truck and driver are the same.

1397
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,850
Same black cap and goggles.

1398
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,730
Call the RTA.

1399
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:14,850
So both the numbers are fake.

1400
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,940
So Sai Kiran couriers must be fake as well.

1401
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,060
This is the guy we want.

1402
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,310
Zoom in..

1403
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,980
The photo looks pixelated.

1404
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,400
Call Shinde and ask him to depixelate the photo.

1405
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:30,350
And send the same screenshot to my phone.

1406
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,190
Sorry, Vikram.

1407
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:03,350
He has a cap in both the pictures which
puts the face is in an underexposed area.

1408
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:05,060
It is not possible to depixelate.

1409
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:21,690
Are you stuck?

1410
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:24,770
This is the guy I want.

1411
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,100
Though everything seems to be in my control,
I am unable to do anything.

1412
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:32,150
Sir, looking at how things are,
I am worried that I may not be able to save Neha too.

1413
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:37,060
You've already faced the same kind of
situation in your life and lost someone you loved.

1414
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,310
And you stand facing the same situation again.

1415
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,600
I know you can do this.

1416
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:43,230
Because you have the strive which I admire the most.

1417
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,900
Go get that son of a bit**.

1418
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:53,850
Hello, Rohit...

1419
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,480
Immediately come to Pedda Golconda police station.

1420
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:57,940
Constable...

1421
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,020
Sir...

1422
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:02,520
I need the profile of every criminal in this area.

1423
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:25,440
Hey, what does he want?

1424
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:27,100
He asked for the criminals' list, sir.

1425
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,440
Your 'sir' must be on that list too.

1426
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:32,100
Nobody is listening to me.

1427
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:45,940
What?

1428
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:13,850
I am gonna fu**ing screw your life man.

1429
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:19,350
Hey, you are done Vikram.

1430
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,150
I am going to report this right now.

1431
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:22,350
I am calling Vishwa sir.

1432
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:23,400
You're done, man.

1433
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,940
You cannot get away with this.
I am gonna fu**ing escalate this.

1434
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:29,190
Where is Vishwa sir, is he in his office or at his home?

1435
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,770
I wanna talk to him right now.

1436
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,190
Let me know.

1437
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,400
I'll wait on line

1438
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,560
Find out immediately.

1439
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:37,270
Yes, it's bloody important.

1440
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:40,520
He is not taking my call.

1441
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,650
That is the reason I am calling you, connect me to him

1442
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,060
Go to hell, man.

1443
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:46,730
I will send a voice message.

1444
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:48,230
Hey, send it, who cares.

1445
01:40:48,230 --> 01:40:49,520
I am not talking to you.

1446
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:52,690
Sir, I have been trying to reach you
for some time now.

1447
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,690
I sent him a voice message.

1448
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:06,520
Send a constable immediately to his house.
I am coming there right now.

1449
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:33,400
Hello, excuse me!

1450
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,190
What do you want?
-Hey, where is this mechanic?

1451
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:38,400
I don't know.

1452
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:41,440
Do you know where he lives?
-I have no idea.

1453
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:48,150
Is Ibrahim home?

1454
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:49,900
Please wait a minute.
-Please call him.

1455
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:54,310
What happened Sir?

1456
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:56,850
Do you know the mechanic
who repaired your scooter the other day?

1457
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:58,400
Yes, Fahad, I know him.

1458
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,730
Do you know where he lives?

1459
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,810
He lives in the outskirts.
What happened, sir?

1460
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:02,650
Come with me.

1461
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,020
I'll just change and come.

1462
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:05,770
Make it quick...

1463
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:06,600
Okay.

1464
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:24,020
Let's go, Sir.
-Let's go.

1465
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:40,040
Sir, look at that bulb.

1466
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,120
That is where he lives.

1467
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:54,790
Ibrahim, isn't this the blue car you saw?

1468
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:58,120
Yes, sir, this is the car.

1469
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:32,450
Hey...

1470
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:42,790
Damn!

1471
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,500
Hey, stop...

1472
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,080
Stop.

1473
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:57,910
Stop.

1474
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:04,290
Tell me...where is Neha?

1475
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:08,330
Where are you running away?

1476
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:09,620
Where is Neha?

1477
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,330
Stop.

1478
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:15,620
Stop.

1479
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,750
Stop... you idiot.

1480
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:28,450
Fahad stop.

1481
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:47,080
Where is Neha?

1482
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:52,750
Speak...

1483
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,080
Speak out.

1484
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,620
Where is the girl?

1485
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:05,830
Where..?

1486
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,000
What happened, sir?

1487
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:03,870
Ibrahim...

1488
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:12,500
Ibrahim...

1489
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:14,950
Ibrahim...

1490
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:33,540
Hey, where is Neha?

1491
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:35,250
Where?

1492
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:36,830
I did not do it, sir.

1493
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,080
Tell me...

1494
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,290
I was hired to do this.

1495
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:41,830
Who..?

1496
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:43,410
I will take you there.

1497
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,120
Come.

1498
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:55,580
Here, sir.

1499
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:03,290
Vikram, I will come along with you.

1500
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,500
Call for back up.

1501
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,950
Tell them to come without a siren.

1502
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:09,500
Meanwhile, if something goes wrong, kill this Idiot.

1503
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,330
Don't move.

1504
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,080
Vikram, what happened to you?

1505
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:07,160
What're all those wounds on your body?

1506
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:08,370
Hey, Rohit, come here and sit.

1507
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,950
Come here and sit.

1508
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,370
Rohit, did you do it?

1509
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:26,000
Where is Neha?

1510
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:28,790
I tried to tell you...
-Hey, don't move

1511
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,450
Relax, it's okay.

1512
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:33,790
Rohit...
-I know it's over.

1513
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:37,370
I tried many times to talk about this Vikram.

1514
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
But I know you won't listen to me.
-Rohit, don't move.

1515
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:22,580
Rohit...

1516
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:24,410
Rohit...

1517
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,500
Rohit...

1518
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:27,910
Rohit, what happened to you?

1519
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:30,200
Rohit...

1520
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:32,250
Rohit, speak.

1521
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:33,290
Rohit...

1522
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:35,620
Rohit...

1523
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:39,200
Rohit...

1524
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,580
Rohit...

1525
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:42,500
Rohit...What happened?

1526
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,580
Swapna, where is Neha?

1527
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:04,200
But what made him do all this?

1528
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:07,620
Rohit is not behind all this.

1529
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:09,950
It's me!

1530
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,870
I am the one who did this.

1531
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:05,160
It all started at Saraswati's orphanage.

1532
01:52:07,410 --> 01:52:12,410
Preeti, my sister Alekhya and I,
three of us stayed in that orphanage.

1533
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:19,120
Back then, Mohan's brother Shiva and
his wife Priya flew down from the US to adopt a girl.

1534
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:23,580
Among all, these girls suit your requirements
of age group and your situation.

1535
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,330
You can choose anyone you like.

1536
01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:26,910
I hope you remember what I told you about.

1537
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:32,080
Whoever you choose,
it's only after her consent that I can let you adopt.

1538
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,910
Of course ma'am.

1539
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:34,620
We are okay with any one of the three girls.

1540
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:38,700
I cannot tell you how beautiful it felt when they hugged.

1541
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I wanted that kind of love too.

1542
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:44,660
But more than me, my sister was in need of that love.

1543
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:47,700
Alekhya has a minor heart problem.

1544
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:51,540
Doctors assured that her heart
will automatically heal in two to three years.

1545
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:55,410
But if you don't want to adopt her,
you still can choose between the other two girls.

1546
01:52:55,410 --> 01:52:56,790
Nothing like that madam.

1547
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:57,910
We are fine with anyone.

1548
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:59,830
Okay, let's do one thing.

1549
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:05,790
Preeti, you know that my sister has a heart problem.

1550
01:53:05,950 --> 01:53:08,790
If she goes with them, she has better
chances of living a long and healthy life.

1551
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,040
So if they ask you, can you tell them
that you are not interested.

1552
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,250
Okay, sister.

1553
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:15,500
Preeti...

1554
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:19,040
Yes madam, I am coming.

1555
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,580
In just a few months, my sister passed away on her birthday.

1556
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:56,160
Slowly I started to accept the
fact that my sister is no more.

1557
01:53:56,160 --> 01:54:01,620
But unknowingly I developed
some kind of rage against Preeti.

1558
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:05,290
I met Rohit after I came out of the orphanage.

1559
01:54:05,370 --> 01:54:09,410
No matter how good he took care of me,
I just couldn't forget my sister.

1560
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:20,790
Rohit took me to a pub one day.

1561
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:24,450
I happened to see Preeti there.

1562
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:30,120
I saw her happily dancing with her friends.

1563
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:35,290
Who?

1564
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:36,660
Preeti...

1565
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,290
Come, come...
-Come, come...

1566
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:51,540
And when I saw that Preeti was so happy;
strange sadness shot up in me.

1567
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:54,200
I thought, shouldn't it be my sister in her place?

1568
01:54:54,370 --> 01:54:56,330
I went into depression.

1569
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:59,290
Rohit tried to help me a lot.

1570
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:02,660
But I was not in a state of mind
to accept his help and move forward.

1571
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,700
Slowly my sadness turned into fury.

1572
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:09,750
And one day, that fury propelled me to kill her.

1573
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:13,450
I learned about Mechanic Fahad.

1574
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:18,450
I hired him to kidnap Preeti.

1575
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:20,370
Speak out, you Idiot.

1576
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:23,410
She told me that she would give me a lot of money, sir.

1577
01:56:41,410 --> 01:56:42,200
Oh my god!

1578
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:43,580
Swapna...

1579
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:44,870
Swapna...

1580
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:46,250
What happened?

1581
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,790
I killed Preeti on my sister's birthday.

1582
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,040
Swapna, what is this?

1583
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:03,750
Rohit,

1584
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:05,040
Preeti...

1585
01:57:06,250 --> 01:57:07,540
Rohit, Preeti...

1586
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,700
I have not killed her intentionally.

1587
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:12,830
I have not killed her intentionally.

1588
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,910
It just happened!

1589
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:17,700
Rohit would not have thought that I'd do such a thing.

1590
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:24,040
But after he heard about the pain I went through;
he chose me over his duty.

1591
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,370
Rohit, Preeti...

1592
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:57,330
Soon Preeti's case got transferred to HIT.

1593
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:00,160
Neha started analyzing the pieces of evidence.

1594
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:06,120
One day Neha called Mr Srinivas but lucky for me,
she couldn't get through.

1595
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,620
So, she called Rohit.

1596
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:09,160
Hello,

1597
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:11,500
I identified important information in Preeti's case.

1598
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:14,790
Partial fingerprints have been detected
from a needle found at the crime scene.

1599
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:16,500
That's great.

1600
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,830
Neither Preeti's DNA nor her blood
has been detected on it.

1601
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:23,410
When I looked for fingerprints,
only partial fingerprints were detected.

1602
01:58:23,410 --> 01:58:24,620
Let's run a quick check.

1603
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:29,450
There you go.

1604
01:58:35,290 --> 01:58:40,000
We need to check with fingerprints bureau,
as they are partial fingerprints.

1605
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,910
Since this information should not reach
Mr Srinivas at any cost...

1606
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,870
Rohit went to Neha's house that very night.

1607
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:26,750
We kept Neha in our house.

1608
01:59:26,870 --> 01:59:29,120
Vikram, it was not our idea to kill Neha.

1609
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:33,370
We thought of illegally immigrating somewhere abroad.

1610
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:36,000
Rohit made all the arrangements with the help of his friends.

1611
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:41,200
But we kept waiting for Rohit's mother
to be taken to his elder brother.

1612
01:59:41,370 --> 01:59:45,830
Our plan was to sedate Neha and leave.

1613
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:47,950
They wanted to leave her and go, sir.

1614
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:52,330
But if she survives, am I not the one to get caught?

1615
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:56,830
I was going to kill her,
when this 'sir' stopped me.

1616
01:59:56,950 --> 02:00:01,830
When Sheila wrote the note that a dead body
can be found at Raju's guest house...

1617
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:05,000
Rohit dug out Preeti's body again.

1618
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:06,870
But Rohit is a very nice guy.

1619
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:12,290
He didn't even like Sheila getting
punished because of me.

1620
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:19,040
So he met a few of your suspects again without telling you.

1621
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:23,620
He collected their DNA samples without their knowledge.

1622
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:29,660
He Implanted those samples on Preeti's
body which he dug.

1623
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:39,870
And buried her back at the same spot where Sheila said.

1624
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:47,750
In the same way, he contaminated the mud
samples of Sheila's car tyres and shoes.

1625
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:50,500
Rohit did not try to frame anyone.

1626
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:54,040
It was our sole motto to run away
as soon as the case got cold.

1627
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,370
Rohit shouldn't have died like this.

1628
02:01:12,370 --> 02:01:13,160
Then what about Lata?

1629
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:15,410
I don't know who Lata is, Vikram.

1630
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:16,370
It's all about money sir!

1631
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:20,290
Once I tasted so much money,
I got greedy and wanted more and more of it.

1632
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:23,540
So I tried to kidnap Lata.

1633
02:02:25,290 --> 02:02:26,330
Sorry, sir.

1634
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:27,790
For what, Vikram?

1635
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:29,750
I could not save your daughter.

1636
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,200
No, Vikram...

1637
02:02:32,910 --> 02:02:34,410
I should thank you instead.

1638
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:42,200
If not for you, we would have suffered
for the rest of our lives not knowing about Preeti.

1639
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:45,450
You gave us a closure.

1640
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,410
Many thanks, Vikram.

1641
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:45,250
It's really nice... what you've done.

1642
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:46,250
What?

1643
02:03:46,330 --> 02:03:50,830
I heard that you took up the responsibility of
sending money to the orphanage for its maintenance.

1644
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,000
I totally love you Vicky.

1645
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,200
How are you coping up?

1646
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:05,120
Dear Vikram...

1647
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:14,000
I know that you will solve this case.

1648
02:04:14,830 --> 02:04:16,330
I know you will come for me.

1649
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:23,330
And when you come for me, I will shoot you with my gun.

1650
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,950
But that gun will not have any bullets, Vikram.

1651
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,250
Only your bullet can give me an honourable ending.

1652
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,620
It was nice knowing you.

1653
02:04:34,870 --> 02:04:36,000
Your friend forever.

1654
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:37,500
Rohit.

1655
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:03,370
I asked you many times, but you never talk about it.

1656
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:05,410
Why do you get these panic attacks?

1657
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:07,120
Why don't you tell me about your past?

1658
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:11,950
Tell me, Vicky.

1659
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:16,290
Not now.

1660
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:18,830
I'll tell you some other time Neha.

1661
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:23,540
Let's go.

1662
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:38,660
Fu**

1663
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:39,580
Vikram...

1664
02:05:56,620 --> 02:06:00,950
"I don't know which high tide is thrusting my way..."

1665
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:06,330
"Should I be the wind to divert it another way..."

1666
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:12,290
"Even if time is ceasing my breath
and throwing me down to hell..."

1667
02:06:12,410 --> 02:06:16,830
"With wings wide open I have overcome my past..."

1668
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:19,370
" It's a battle..."

1669
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:22,540
"No matter how big an enemy, I will not give up."

1670
02:06:22,540 --> 02:06:23,660
" It's a battle..."

1671
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:29,290
"Oohh....every second is a challenge!
I am ready!"

1672
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:37,580
"No matter what I will never look back
and continue this battle."

1673
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:46,000
"The death which follows will never
surrender though I keep running"

1674
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,450
"Should I snatch the fangs out and rewrite fate..."

1675
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:56,750
"Pitch darkness with not blind the atrocities,
even if baffled."

1676
02:06:56,750 --> 02:07:02,160
"Won't the fangs retreat when its daybreak..."

1677
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:12,290
"There is a world, hidden inside me..."

1678
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:17,830
"Asking me if there is a way out..."

1679
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:23,660
"Let me be the hands of the clock that keeps ticking"

1680
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:28,410
"And stop time to find out who runs it."

1681
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:30,450
"It's a battle..."

1682
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:33,910
"No matter how big an enemy,
I will not give up..."

1683
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:35,330
"It's a battle..."

1684
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:41,370
"Oohh....every second is a challenge!
I am ready!"

1685
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:48,790
"No matter what I will never look back
and continue this battle.
