1
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,599
Is it worth seeing this place paying money?

2
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,599
It's only twenty rupees.

3
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,566
It'll be a regret not seeing
Mangalasheri Mana in Ottapalam.

4
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,299
The gate in movies was a padipura?

5
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,405
That was in the movies, this is original.

6
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,513
Entry with pass.
Time 9AM to 5.30PM.

7
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,532
Is there any shooting going on?

8
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,499
A marriage photo shoot is going on.

9
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,699
Not that, any film shoot?

10
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,132
Shooting of Vijay's Tamil movie just got over.

11
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,099
Mammootty's new film will start next month.

12
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,635
OK.

13
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,466
Next, we will take a photo with sister sitting"

14
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,299
and brother standing on the swing and
swaying.

15
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,032
That is not a good decision.

16
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,070
We would like to go for honeymoon soon.

17
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,366
Take a photo.

18
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,109
Are you game with Mangalasheri Neelakandan?

19
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:33,499
This is the deity of Mangalasheri family.

20
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,447
The ceremony is on the uthrattathi
day of Malayalam month kumba.

21
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,599
Think of your favourite actor.

22
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,332
Did you think?

23
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,232
Yes.

24
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,232
Look into my eyes.

25
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:03,166
Mohanlal.

26
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,266
Isn't this easy.

27
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,499
You should have thought ofa
person difficult to guess.

28
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,766
How did you guess?

29
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,466
Please teach us the secret behind this.

30
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,099
This is Mentalism.

31
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,099
Mental?

32
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,632
Mentalism!

33
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,232
Do you know who is staying in the guest
house..

34
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:19,166
For Dr. Venu's Kayakalpa treatment?

35
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,632
Stop boasting.

36
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,407
Idiot.

37
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:43,133
I know the trick, you mentalists
do to make an object rotate.

38
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,041
Don't try to trick me.

39
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:54,046
Your time starts now.

40
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:58,432
Is Sir's 'Kayakalpa' also a trick like this?

41
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,599
It's a proven science.

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I've a lot of patients who have
completed till Kudipravesha.

43
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,099
Haven't you come here to test me..

44
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,732
In the name of 'Kayakalpa' treatment?

45
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,732
Isn't that a good experiment?

46
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,766
Especially when our body
itself is the test object?

47
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:25,115
Like a snake shedding its skin?

48
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,410
[Shocked]..

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,446
Mentalism is also true, Sir.

50
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,066
This was just a mischievous thought on your

51
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:07,399
Instagram video on mind power yesterday.

52
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,108
But still, I have my doubts.

53
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,370
Was there anyone inside the
'Mana' yesterday night?

54
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,232
No.

55
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:21,233
Some kids are coming for a
short film shoot tomorrow.

56
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,439
Why?

57
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,066
Just asked.

58
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:32,039
I'm scared when you ask like this.

59
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,066
Welcome..

60
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,232
Short film team, isn't it?

61
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:17,699
Yes.

62
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,466
I am Tapas.

63
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:19,066
You are Unniyettan, isn't it?

64
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:19,499
Yes.

65
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,366
Are you alone?

66
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,532
Others will join soon.

67
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,766
This not a film shooting like you think.

68
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,232
There will only be a few of us.

69
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,099
I know.

70
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,332
Many people come here to make short film.

71
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,732
If asked for rent, they will not give.

72
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,732
We will give the rent.
- OK.

73
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,632
Butwe will need Unniyettan's help and support.

74
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,066
If you give the rent on time"

75
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,546
my support will be always there.

76
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,399
There is a hall upstairs.

77
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,132
Only that, some art work will need to be done.

78
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,466
Are visitors are less today?

79
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,266
Visitors will come only on Saturday and
Sunday.

80
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,699
By the way, haven't you booked hotel for stay?

81
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,766
We don't need any room.
- Oh!

82
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:49,732
We will stay here.

83
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,066
This facility is enough.

84
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,732
Actually, this is an adventure for us.

85
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,566
I have never seen the people
who are going to come.

86
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,566
We are all online friends.

87
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,566
There is a Facebook group
named 'Cinema Pranthanmar'!

88
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,399
We have acquainted through that.
- OK.

89
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,132
Whatever it is, you cannot stay here.

90
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,699
Please don't say like that, Unniyettan.

91
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,266
This place is a nostalgia of many good films.

92
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,975
We will go only after enjoying all of this.

93
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,232
Next person has come.

94
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,270
Mangalasseri Neelakandan.

95
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:28,732
Isn't Mangalasheri Neelakandan,
Mohanlal's character in Devasuram?

96
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,441
This Neelakandan is Mohanlal's biggest fan.

97
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:35,432
In our group, most ofthem have such nick
names.

98
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,566
Only very less people like me uses original
names.

99
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,199
Then what is Neelakandan's real name?

100
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,032
I too do not know.

101
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:41,499
What?

102
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,266
That is the biggest thrill of this get together.

103
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,699
Are you making short film with..

104
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,232
People whom you have never met?

105
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,266
Don't you need Iooktest?

106
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,099
No.
- Why?

107
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,766
We are shooting our own story.
- Oh!

108
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,132
About some Facebook friends
who don't know each other.

109
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,699
During an interval in their life..

110
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,532
They are getting together at Mangalasheri mana.

111
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,532
The name of the film is
also the same - 'lnterval'!

112
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,266
Now, whatever is their physique..

113
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,766
Let them act as they are.
- OK.

114
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,766
I am thinking of marketing this short film..

115
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,632
Highlighting this uniqueness.
How is it?

116
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,632
There is a good possibility that it will be good.

117
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,432
Mangalasheri Neelakandan! [Sarcastic]

118
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:13,279
A duplicate is duplicate
and original is original.

119
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,799
Hey give me the money and go.

120
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,799
Oh! sorry.

121
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,566
I was just savoring this moment.

122
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,366
Here, keep the change.

123
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,099
I don't need anytip from you.

124
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,399
Here is your cash.

125
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,499
I had planned a heavy mass intro..

126
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,599
You spoiled it.

127
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,671
Idiot.

128
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,099
Brother!

129
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,066
Tapas.

130
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,766
Mangalasheri!

131
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,499
<i>Ramanand.</i>

132
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,166
<i>Ramanand Kalathingal.</i>

133
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,066
A Lalettan touch in the name itself.

134
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:22,566
Really?

135
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:22,766
Yes.

136
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:23,666
My family gave me the name.

137
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,532
No one else came?

138
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:25,332
They are coming.

139
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,599
Tell me..what are you doing?

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,599
I stay at Dubai.

141
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,599
I have a family hotel business.

142
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,166
Oh! can make out from your looks.

143
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,166
This is Unniyettan.

144
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,238
He is all in all here.

145
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,509
Why are you looking at me like this?

146
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,566
Shall I call you 'Warrier'?

147
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,566
Do you mind?

148
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,299
How did you know that I'm Warrier?

149
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,232
Shouldn't it be only that!

150
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,270
Where were you all these days?

151
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:10,315
[Singing-J

152
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,299
Brother..what are you doing?

153
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,032
This is 'Udukku'.

154
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:13,766
This is 'ldakka'.

155
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:14,499
Idakka?

156
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,699
I've lost touch as I am not frequently using.

157
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,432
A girl in our group has come at the gate.

158
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,299
What! a girl?

159
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,299
Unniyettan doesn't let her inside.

160
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,032
You just hold this.

161
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,632
Why can't you let me in?

162
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,732
It's not so.. Listen to me.

163
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,266
If you have allowed gents in my group to enter..

164
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:31,366
I will also enter.

165
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,099
I don't have any issue letting you in..

166
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,566
What I said is you can't stay here.

167
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,666
Who are you to decide that?

168
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,699
I decide all things happening here.

169
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,737
Make her understand.

170
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,232
Iam OK!

171
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,199
What is this old man telling, Tapas Menon?

172
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,232
That's correct.

173
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:54,999
Who is he?

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,666
Me..

175
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,466
Is he another crazy staff?

176
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,132
Don't you recognise me?

177
00:11:59,133 --> 00:11:59,466
- No.

178
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,699
<i>I am Mangalasheri Neelakandan
alias Ramanand Kalathingal.</i>

179
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,199
I am a bachelor.

180
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,799
I am Anu Thankam Paulose.
- OK.

181
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,799
Father and Mother is in my name itself.
- Oh!

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,766
Mothera Hindu and Father a Christian.

183
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,399
I guessed it seeing the feminism.

184
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,766
Sardine might be yourfavourite fish?

185
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:14,532
Shut up.

186
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,532
This is how a girl becomes a feminist!

187
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,032
Tell me Anu..
- Yes?

188
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,366
Exactly, where are you from..

189
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,199
What are you doing"

190
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,599
are you married?

191
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,099
Actually I am from Australia,
a nurse and divorced..

192
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,599
Are you divorced, is ittrue?

193
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,032
Me too!

194
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,666
But didn't you tell you are a bachelor'?

195
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,399
But, we call a divorcee a bachelor, isn't it?

196
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,566
Oh!

197
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,466
Priya Kuttos won't come it seems.

198
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,432
Her boyfriend eloped with someone else it
seems.

199
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:40,166
I don't mind if someone doesn't come anymore.

200
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:43,299
Anyway, Anu has come.
- Hmm"

201
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,132
Then who will enact the characters in my
script?

202
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,299
'Chathiyan Chandu' who had
confirmed has also not reached.

203
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,732
Anyways, Shahrukh Khan will reach now.

204
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,499
How did you know, there is
no message in the group!

205
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,099
I got a message now.
- Is it?

206
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,766
Do you have prior acquaintance with Shahrukh
Khan?

207
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,199
Yes, we chat occasionally.

208
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,099
But he is smart.

209
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,766
It would have been difficult if he had not come.

210
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,732
Title song is planned with his dance.

211
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,066
Oh! Is he a dancer?

212
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,066
Then he will be a boring person.

213
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,066
I do not like dancers at all..

214
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:05,799
With all those six pack and body shape"

215
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,132
Ugly fellows, seriously.

216
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,132
[Temple bells..]

217
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:08,766
See..it's true.

218
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,266
Is that a Temple?
- Yes.

219
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,132
I will go pray and come back.

220
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:12,166
Anu...
- Yes?

221
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,399
That Temple has along life..

222
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,399
I too just thought of praying, come.

223
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,199
God!..please make herfall in love.

224
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,271
He is a nuisance.

225
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,566
We can plan the Christmas scene here.

226
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,432
We'll decorate with lights here.

227
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:31,132
Crib, we will place it here.
- OK.

228
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,132
Who is that?

229
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,399
Shahrukh Khan!

230
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,437
Is it Shahrukh!

231
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:43,166
Godl, it should not be a six pack.

232
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,239
What is this pack?

233
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,999
[All surprisedl]

234
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,999
This is not Shahrukh Khan!

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,071
Isn't she Kajol?

236
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,599
'Kuch kuch hota hai..'

237
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,705
Hai.

238
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,499
I am confused now!

239
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,499
Should I choose this?

240
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,399
Niranjana.

241
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,232
Shahrukh Khan?
- Yes.

242
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,332
Oh! OK.

243
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,466
Being a female, why is your id 'Shahrukh
Khan'?

244
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,599
Simple.
I am a real Shahrukh Khan fan.

245
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,432
Yes, you should be real..

246
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,132
That is what Neelakandan loves.

247
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,266
Who is this?

248
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,099
Do you recognise me?

249
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,699
This is Neelakandan.

250
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,532
Of course, my beautiful girl, Karutham ma.

251
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,466
But this was a surprise even to me!

252
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,399
What, that I am a girl?

253
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,399
Don't get tensed because of that.

254
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,566
Ifeel, I am more ofa tom boyish type.

255
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,566
Throw away that coffee, I'll give sip up.

256
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,399
What are you doing, child?

257
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,066
You could tell Uncle if you needed coffee.

258
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,399
How will we know ifthey have
some infectious disease?

259
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,266
Oh, no!

260
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,766
This is Mani Uncle.

261
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,099
He looks after my grandmother.

262
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,266
Hi.

263
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,566
There are some demands for our
grandmother before the shoot starts.

264
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:57,266
OK.
- What?

265
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,366
Gents should not touch her while acting.

266
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,266
[Irritated].

267
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,732
She will only act wearing
dresses below knee length.

268
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,066
But, now the dress is above the knee.

269
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,366
That is her wish.

270
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:05,566
What?

271
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,766
That can't be the case in cinema.

272
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:07,666
Very bad.

273
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,099
Isn't there a bathroom here?

274
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,066
Washroom is overthere.

275
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,432
It's not to wash, I need to pass stool.

276
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,532
I will go and come back.

277
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,299
[Disgustedfl

278
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,299
Will he be with us during the full shoot?

279
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,766
That is the plan, but we will see.

280
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,599
Yes, please make him leave.

281
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,599
You come., I will show you the place.

282
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,999
Tapas..she is an atom bomb.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,501
You do one thing.

284
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,199
Create a script such that I am carrying
her and dancing with the tune.

285
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,199
That will be a hit.

286
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,199
Firstly, you don't spoil anything.

287
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,032
Go away, if you don't want.

288
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,070
[om song lyrics]

289
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,232
Why are you tensed, children?

290
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,766
'There is no better mix in the world'..

291
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,766
Don't you remember these words of
Induchoodettan?

292
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,332
Yes [Irritated]

293
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,799
Dropping from school after completing 10th..

294
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,132
Didn't your parents say anything?

295
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:56,799
For what?

296
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,666
They know that I like dance.

297
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,099
My parents are cool.

298
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,699
I did a change in the script.

299
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,132
What is it?

300
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:05,266
I reworked the portions of
Priya Kuttos and Silk Smitha.

301
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:05,332
OK.

302
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,666
We will split and take the
dialogues of Chathiyan Chandu.

303
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,166
OK?

304
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,199
That will be wonderful.

305
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,372
Didn't I tell you the other day.

306
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,099
He is a cheater, 'Chathiyan Chandu'.

307
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,566
I should be blamed to believe
him and come fonlvard forthis.

308
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,432
Why do you get tensed when I am here?

309
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,599
This 'Jagannathan' will do anything underthe
sky.

310
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,580
You need to only make ready 3 ice cubes.

311
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,632
Sorry, I am late.

312
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,066
Hello guys.

313
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:29,566
Why are you all staring at me?

314
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,566
You don't recognise me?

315
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,566
You don't recognise me?
Guess.

316
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,799
Who is this Malayalam speaking Bengali?

317
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,099
I don't know.

318
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,466
If you have ordered food from hotel..

319
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,566
Pay and send him off.

320
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,599
Your daddy is a Bengali.

321
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,766
It's me, 'Chathiyan Chandu'.

322
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,766
Oh!

323
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:43,566
You are shocked, isn't it?

324
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,132
You are shocked.

325
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:44,566
You are shocked.

326
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,766
I got shocked 3 times.

327
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,432
Is this Anchovy 'Chathiyan Chandu'?

328
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,599
He is not at all a bait for Neelakandan.

329
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,032
G o away.

330
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,232
Are you Neelakandan?

331
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:52,632
Yes.

332
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,766
You fat guy.

333
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,566
An actor firstly should have a fit body like me.

334
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,699
Not like a banana stem cut into pieces.

335
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,199
We will get acquainted slowly.

336
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,766
First of all, my hugs and kisses.

337
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:03,799
Please get up.

338
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,366
Hey!

339
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,099
You come.

340
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,099
He is a loving person.

341
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,399
Joffin, Joffin T Chacko.

342
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,766
What is this?

343
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,499
Why, don't we have hugs and kissmis?

344
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,799
I don'tthinkthat is necessary.

345
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,666
Anyways good.

346
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,666
You came at the correct time.

347
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,432
<i>Iwill</i> do onething"

348
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:17,099
I will read out the script.

349
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,599
No, I don't think that is necessary.

350
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,266
I will lose the thrill while watching the movie.

351
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:20,799
Oh!

352
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,799
Then I shall WhatsApp the final draft.
OK.

353
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,032
No, a natural actor doesnfiét require that.

354
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,099
I am spontaneous.

355
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,366
Idiot!

356
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,332
You know how costly the bottle was?

357
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,266
Mullankolli Velayudettan has put
the bottle to cool, that's all.

358
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:33,599
You idiot!

359
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,232
Oh, don't we put the bottle upside down to
cool!

360
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,474
Do you have another one to take?

361
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,732
Do you get good salary at Lulu mall?

362
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,066
Things will work out.

363
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:43,766
But not enough for my lifestyle.

364
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:46,599
But, I will start my shop there in a year.

365
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,266
Why are you so confident?

366
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,799
I'll make the shop I'm working"

367
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,399
shut down within a year.

368
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,232
Then that space is free.

369
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,232
Everything will work as per God's will.

370
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,332
What is his ID?

371
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,332

- That's the reason.

372
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,066

373
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,066
Guys, one second.

374
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,066

376
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:30,345
Where did I keep it?

377
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,313
Hmm.

378
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,766
Who is this Kattappa wearing skirt?

379
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:52,466
Is he dead?

380
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:56,266
Is he from our group?

381
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:56,766
Excuse me.

382
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,166
He is not dead!

383
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,099
Yes?

384
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,532
Who are you?

385
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:06,266
I am the patient staying there.

386
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,366
Mental patient at Madampalli?

387
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:11,143
Is that a saying?
- Yes.

388
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:16,132
Myself and Unniyettan usually
plays cards at this time.

389
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,266
He just left.

390
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:18,769
Sorry, as the shoot will start from tomorrow..

391
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,099
That will be difficult.
- Oh!

392
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,999
He had indicated.

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,766
Anyway all the best.

- OK, Joffin.

397
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,006

Kalathingal.
Unniyettan had told.

402
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,399
Anyway, take care.

403
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,732
What are you doing?

404
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,337
No specific work to say.

405
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,380
Then it's playing cards only.
- OK.

406
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:55,099
Why are you here, Sir?

407
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,299
Do you remember me?

408
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,066
You published my father's book at Delhi.

409
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,273
Oh! JNU?
- Yes.

410
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,632
Venu sir's daughter?
- Yes.

411
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,799
Is he still teaching there?

412
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,643
Father will retire next year.
- OK

413
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,799
Guys, this is famous mentalist, John Don
Bosco.

414
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,609
Mental!
He is mentalist.

415
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,699
Sir, shall Itake a picture?

416
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,266
Father will be happy seeing this.

417
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:22,047
Don't put the flash on.
It will reflect after hitting his head.

418
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,411
Actually this is devil's sign.
- ls it, really?

419
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,641
Then we can hold like this.
- What is this?

420
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,699
You will be here for some days?
- Yes.

421
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,202
You need to teach me mentalism this time.

422
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,266
Last time you promised me.

423
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,266
Sure.

424
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,066
Mentalism is fraud, all are pre-planned.

425
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,199
Panikkayoor is my Facebook friend.
- He has told.

426
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,510
That might be true.

427
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,635
Else, do one thing.

428
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,766
Closing your eyes, without touching"

429
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:47,771
can you show any item?

430
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,099
Isn't challenge boring, Raman?

431
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,499
See..that's it!

432
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,309
Sorry Sir.
- It's OK.

433
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,166
Ramanand has reopened a new restaurant?
- Yes.

434
00:20:57,167 --> 00:21:00,099
You should be careful when you
send messages to clients.

435
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,299
Else you will lose clients.

436
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,099
It's not 'We are reopened'..

437
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,566
Its 'We have reopened.'

438
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,599
Check your message.

439
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,332
Where?

440
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,266
It's correct!

441
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:13,166
OK.
- Brother, no Sir..

442
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:16,232
It's only that I liked
Panikkayoofis Facebook page.

443
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,566
I do not know him personally.

444
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,732
How did you find it?

445
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:19,466
This is simple.

446
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:22,107
Sound of each letter on keypad is different.

447
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,232
Just listen to that.

448
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,632
Is that all?
Was this what you call mentalism?

449
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:30,012
Tiff between Joffin's father is not over yet?

450
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,632
What?

451
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,132
Anyways, after a point.

452
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,432
It's better to leave from home.

453
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,599
That will make us more independent.

454
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,580
You take care.

455
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,599
Is it true that there is a tiff with your father'?

456
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,601
Only that is there!

457
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,399
But how did he get to know this?

458
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,766
Did you send any message to yourfather?

459
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,766
No, I don't have balance in my phone.

460
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:59,767
[Evening prayer-J

461
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,166
God, be with us.

462
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:55,099
Warrier, at times, shall I call you 'Peringodafi?

463
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,766
What is that for'?

464
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:58,077
Simply, for fun.

465
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,099
Call me ifthere is any need.

466
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,632
I'm staying 2 houses ahead.

467
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,766
I allowed you to stay only because John sir
told.

468
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:07,399
Oh!

469
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,279
Request you not to create
any disrepute to the Mana.

470
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,766
You go Unniyetta.
Everything is OK here.

471
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,066
Ifthat is so, good for you.
- OK.

472
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:17,099
One more thing.

473
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,132
If you hear any unpleasant sound at night.

474
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,099
No one should come out.

475
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,132
Why is there any problem?

476
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:26,299
It's a place where lot of souls wander.

477
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,766
The last Tham puran committed suicide here.

478
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,766
Is it the sixth Thampuran?

479
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,399
Thampuran's here do not have any number.

480
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,609
Thampuran's main hobby was
to make dolls for children.

481
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,299
But he did not have any children.

482
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,299
There is nothing to worry, Ijust said.

483
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,299
OK then. Bye.

484
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,699
Simply.
There are no Thampurans without number.

485
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,066
Really?

486
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,066
To my knowledge all
Thampurans have number.

487
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,099
[Lights flickering..]

488
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,047
What is this?

489
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,732
[All frightened]

490
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:01,306
Why is the light flickering?
- Yes!

491
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,366
Doesnfiét it burn like this if the voltage is low?

492
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:04,243
Yes, that's true.

493
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,432
Now, all of you go to sleep.

494
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:07,632
Brother, give us five minutes.

495
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,066
Let us plan for tomorrow's shoot..

496
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:09,732
And go to sleep soon after.

497
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,599
I can't allow any planning at midnight.

498
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,066
You ask.

499
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,705
Please Mani uncle, <i>,</i> allow usfor sometime.

500
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:17,999
OK, only five minutes.

501
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,399
Yes, OK.

502
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,199
Is this nuisance sleeping with us?

503
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,599
Sorry, grandmother won't allow
me to come without Mani uncle.

504
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,732
They both are my biggest
problem when I come to Kerala.

505
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,032
Leave all those now.

506
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:35,432
We all will now arrange for a cot for me to
sleep.

507
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,699
Lying on a mat is difficult.

508
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,299
There is no cot.

509
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,732
Guys, please listen.

510
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:41,733
We all have come from our boring life.

511
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:44,232
After some days, we will return
to the boring life itself.

512
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:44,574
Of course!

513
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,466
But when we return"

514
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:49,232
We will all have a DVD of 'Interval.
- Yes.

515
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,532
It could be a good film, bad film, whatever.

516
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,036
Whenever we watch this later"

517
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,532
It should be full of beautiful
moments of our days here.

518
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:57,999
So from now on..

519
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,432
Let's make each moment count.

520
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:01,099
Yes.
- OK.

521
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,099
Ready?
- Ready.

522
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,566
Isn,A6t this clich\/©, Neeru?

523
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:06,266
Isn't it?

524
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:06,999
Come.

525
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,375
Leave my hand.

526
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,505
Finally it's only 5 of us?

527
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,466
Rati sister had been very active in our group"

528
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,566
Where is she now?

529
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,604
That's because of people like you.

530
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:19,532
Silk Smitha sister didn't
come as her kid is not well.

531
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,333
How did you know?
I did not know!

532
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:24,781
She told me the truth, when I
asked through Sweta Menon's ID.

533
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,410
Oho!

534
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,132
Is 'Sweta Menon', your ID?

535
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,566
Yes, you stupid Chandu.

536
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,666
Do you want me to put the personal chats.

537
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,613
You sent to Sweta Menon in the group?

538
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:33,332
Oh, is that so?

539
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,499
Then I too have something to reveal.

540
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,999
Who do you think Sunny Leone is?

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,799
Is that you!

542
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,199
Guys, why are you blabbering?

543
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,199
You close the door and go to sleep.
- OK.

544
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,632
Go fast.

545
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:44,199
So early?

546
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,633
Good night, sweet dreams.
- Enough ofGood nightwishes.

547
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,266
Are you going now?

548
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:48,999
Now or else at what time?
- Shouldn't they get sleep?

549
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,999
Is it a boarding school?

550
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,466
Is it a never ending discussion?

551
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:56,973
[PrayiHQ]

552
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,481
Is it on this ceiling, the numberless
Thampuran committed suicide?

553
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,513
Why do you want to say that now?

554
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,799
Say a 'No' buddy, onlythen I can sleep.

555
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,766
Then 'No'.

556
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,199
Then we can sleep.

557
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,099
See, it's true.
I got a message.

558
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,433
I will come now.
- Where are you going?

559
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:15,599
Is that your lover?

560
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,499
What is her name?

561
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,533
Just started.

562
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,632
<i>Natasha.
- What?</i>

563
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,766
Natasha Simon.

564
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,766
She is a little fat.
But her father, Simon is very rich.

565
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,566
Oh!
- So ovenlveight is not a matter.

566
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,232
<i>Iwill</i> come now.

567
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:28,372
I think he will die getting beatings.

568
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:37,180
Hello, who is this? [In female voice]

569
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:39,232
Joffin has gone to bed.

570
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:42,432
No, I am Joffin's girlfriend.

571

[Frightened]

574
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,766
It's me Joffin, there is no one else here.

575
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,145
My dear, believe me.

576
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,512
It's me, Joffin.

577
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:13,533
Then, keep the phone and go you fatty.

578
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,432
Never brag about yourfather's wealth at me.

579
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,432
You don't know me..

580
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:19,107
You fatty, ovenlveight lady.

581
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:22,266
You get lost, let me see.

582
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:25,299
I am relieved now.

583
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,280
This was not at all necessary.
Neeru is the only hope now.

584
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,332
Thampuran!

585
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:37,566
[Screaming]

586
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:38,532
What is it?

587
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,566
Ghost..Ghost...
- What is it?

588
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,566
Thampuran's ghost!

589
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:47,432
Thampuran's ghost is there.
- Where, here?

590
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:48,733
Ghost!
- Yes.

591
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:49,432
What is it?

592
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:50,266
What did you see?

593
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:52,532
I saw a real ghost there.
- What happened?

594
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,166
Brother, please go and have a look.

595
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,699
This guy is crazy..you go and sleep.

596
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,976
I am not crazy.
My dear Neeru, I saw.

597
00:27:58,033 --> 00:27:59,099
Tell calmly.

598
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,444
Just shut your mouth.

599
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,245
Hold on.

600
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,799
Give me some water.
- Don't you hear a sound?

601
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,699
There...there it comes.

602
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,666
Is this Thampuran's ghost?

603
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:18,066
Was it you?
- Yes, it's me.

604
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:18,732
What is going on?

605
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:21,066
Did you get scared seeing this joker'?

606
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,999
You don't talk much. If you had seen,
you would also get scared.

607
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,379
Silly guy.
Are you having get together without me?

608
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:31,366
You must take bath in the pond here.
It's very relaxing.

609
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:32,732
Relaxation, at this midnight!

610
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,974
Why do you need a stick to take bath?

611
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,132
To scare away the dogs.

612
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,566
Stick!
- What is this?

613
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,342
This, I got it from the pond.
Isn't it nice?

616
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:45,766
who committed suicide, made dolls?

617
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,266
Is it?

618
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,232
There is a Japanese horror movie..

619
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:54,204
The dead man's spirit is in the doll.

620
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:57,771
Whoever sees that first will die.
- This doll?

621
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,032
[Frightened]

622
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,099
Don't look at me.
You saw it first.

623
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,432
All of you go and sleep.
She told that simply.

624
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:07,099
I know such real stories.

625
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,299
It's dangerous to keep it here.
- What kind of danger?

626
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,132
This is like your barbie doll.
That's all.

627
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,066
Please throw it away, Mani uncle.

628

What is this child?

629

That's <i>all.l</i> should put it
back in the pond, is that all?

630
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,099
Yes.
All of you do one thing"

631
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,332
Close the door and go to sleep.

632
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,266
Come Neeru, we will go and sleep.

633
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:22,066
Hey.
- Leave me.

634
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,011
Sorry, I am tensed, that's why.

635
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:25,099
What is the point of having education?

636
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,766
You cannot do anything, all are cowards.

637
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,032
You all have come to take short film!

638
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:31,766
Anu, if you are scared, don't close the door.

639
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:32,599
Get lost.

640
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,599
Do you need to flirt in the midnight too?

641
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,046
You will be satisfied only if
you took bath in the pond!

So the college boy doesn't
need to recoverteenage?

Oh!, can you stop and come to sleep.

We need to start shoot tomorrow morning.
Teenage..rubbish.

652
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:00,999
I'll tolerate if someone says about my father..

653
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,104
But I won't tolerate if told about Lalettan.

654
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,333
That <i>lwill</i> tell about anyone"

655
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,566
But if you tell about Ikka, I won't tolerate.

656
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:07,069
Can you both go to sleep?

Get lost.

661
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:26,266
All of you please come out.
- What happened?

662
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:27,746
There is a thing outside standing like this.

663
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,399
What is that?
- Come and look.

664
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,277
Put that away you crazy fellow.
- Come here.

665
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,532
There.

666
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,672
Where?

667
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:41,513
It was there.
- There is no one here.

<i>Oh Lord Mahadeva!</i>

669
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,266
We could have invited John sir also.

670
00:30:57,267 --> 00:31:00,976
That bald head is so boring.

671
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,571
Neeru, you forget him.
Simply to increase my pressure.

672
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,572
What is it for?

673
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,635
Normally we crack coconut for Ganapathi?

674
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,476
Even Shekar Kapoor does this in Hollywood.

675
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:18,266
Who is he?
- I don't know.

676
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:19,366
You don't know that also?

677
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:22,466
Let everything go well.
- Thank you Thirumeni.

678
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,566
Are you using 5d camera?

679
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:25,532
Yes.
- Ultra sonic.

680
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,799
I have also directed a short film.

681
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,744
Temple run.

682
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,232
It's a story of a Christian boy
unknowingly entering a temple.

683
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,507
Finally the story will end when the..

684
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,666
Local people catch hold of him and circumcise.

685
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,332
Wonderful story!
- Thirumeni, makea move.

686
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,032
Call me if you have any doubts.

687
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,299
I will be there in the temple.

688
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,177
We have pooja 2 times a day.
- OK.

689
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,133
Then, let your work go well.

690
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:49,205
Was there any mosquito nuisance yesterday
night?

691
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:51,232
No, nuisance from ghosts were there.
- What?

692
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:54,703
Unniarcha, sorry Unniyettan..
- We got a doll from the pond yesterday.

693
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,266
These guys were very frightened"
but I got scared only a little.

694
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:58,233
Moreover, when I got out in the night.

695
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:00,066
One guy was looking at the moonlight.

696
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,433
But later he was not to be seen at all.

697
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:03,433
That might be one ofthe workers..

698
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:05,066
They might have come out due to heat inside.

699
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:06,466
It might be that.

700
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,232
So Unniyettan, you make a move..

701
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:08,233
Let us start.
- OK.

702
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:11,766
Don't you need a cameraman to shoot the film?

703
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,232
We will we do that.

704
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:16,077
You don't need Camera, light, jib, crane etc?

705
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:16,766
Don't you need all these?

706
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,474
The light here is more than enough.

707
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,199
Moreover, everything is digital now.

708
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,766
We even have the history of a
single person making a film.

709
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:22,466
Do you know?
- No.

710
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,332
We are five, then what's the issue?

711
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:28,543
[Sarcasm] Carry on.

712
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,133
Is he teasing us?

713
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:32,432
Why do these come and spoil our
confidence in the morning itself.

714
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:33,433
You forget it.

715
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:35,466
You plan my heavy intro scene now.

716
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:36,733
Let there be some thrill.

717
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,499
He only tried to reduce my confidence..

718
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,666
You don't spoil whatever is left.

719
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:40,066
What?

720
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,172
So don't you want anyone to watch the short
film?

721
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:51,704
Hey?

722
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,240
Yes?

723
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:56,575
Was it you who was standing outside last
night?

724
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,066
Yes, that was me.
Why?.

725
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:01,705
I got scared seeing your bald head.

726
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,566
Did you go to Pazhani?

727
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:04,399
No, this is hair loss.

728
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,032
Yes, isn't it too hot.
Hairfall will happen.

729
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:08,566
Do you have any other work here?

730
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:10,433
<i>Iwill</i> do everything.

731
00:33:10,434 --> 00:33:11,099
That is good.

732
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,066
What are you doing there?

733
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:14,732
Nothing Sir, you take your seat.

734
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:16,099
<i>Iwill</i> come now.
- OK.

735
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,432
Who is that?

736
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,266
He has come here for massage.

737
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:20,766
So, do you know massaging?

738
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:21,599
Oh, yes.

739
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,166
Oh, how much do you get for that?

740
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,266
Nothing specific..
I will receive whatever given.

741
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:27,766
But it's hard for you, isn't it?

742
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:28,266
Yes.

743
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:31,214
We need a massaging person at ourtharavadu.

744
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:32,575
It's for our grandmother.
- OK.

745
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:33,732
Would you be interested?

746
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,432
Let methink.

747
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:37,132
What is there to think?

748
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,766
I will ask them to give ten
thousand rupees as salary..

749
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,766
You will eight thousand and
I will take two thousand.

750
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,333
That is the way we work.

751
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,333
Is it agreeable to you?

752
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:47,499
Anyways, you give it a thought.
- OK.

753
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,666
I will give you eightthousand"

754
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:49,668
[LaUQh]

755
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,433
My desire from the past six years"

756
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:02,632
Prayen.

757
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,399
The zeal that is in my mind as alight.

758
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,242
What is this!

759
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,610
My MangalasherL.

760
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,099
My Mana.

761
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,499
Cut it.

762
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,570
How is it brother?

763
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,433
Do it with some more passion and emotion
brother.

764
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:15,332
Was it not there?

765
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,243
We will try again.

766
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,404
Ifl had a 'ldakka' in my hand"

767
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:18,766
it would have been better.

768
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,099
I'm conscious when my hand is empty.

769
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,238
That is why you have the bag.

770
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,299
But isn't that on my shoulder?

771
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,599
Idakka in hand!

772
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,432
He is making it full comedy.

773
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,999
[Angry]

774
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,632
Silence.
Come, let us try again.

775
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:31,532
We will try.
Shall I provide a suggestion?

776
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,633
Can you make the dialogues lighter?

777
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:34,432
How?

778
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:36,999
Like what ordinary people speak?

779
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,232
This six years of prayer, desire..

780
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:42,299
Removing that and being so natural, like..

781
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,232
'After an interval of six years..'

782
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:48,271
'Induchoodan has come back..'

783
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:51,566
My character does not have such a dialect.

784
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:52,799
Please do as what I say.

785
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,245
OK, I have become the character now.

786
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,632
If that's the character, it's OK.

787
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:58,333
By the way, you don't get tensed..

788
00:34:58,334 --> 00:34:59,799
Even if this short film turns out to be a flop..

789
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,299
<i>Iwill</i> still give you my date.

790
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,799
Aren't you haPPV7

791
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,599
OK, we will try.
One more.

792
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,066
Hope you don't have any trouble from the kids?
<i>+</i>

793
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:07,466
No.

794
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:10,199
It's only because you said"

795
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,304
they are allowed to stay here.

796
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,333
They are good.
I too will have a company.

797
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:14,699
Yes, very good kids. [Sarcastic]

798
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,599
They were very frightened yesterday night!

799
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,266
Why?

800
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:19,042
They got a doll of the Thampuran..

801
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,266
And were telling there is ghost here.

802
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:23,510
Haven't I told you not to
scare people coming here?

803
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:26,032
I did not tell anything.

804
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:27,666
That's the physiology of fear, Unniyettan.

805
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,274
Just a spark is needed to catch fire.

806
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:33,433
Thampuran is here itself, Unniyettan.

807
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:36,133
We used to talk in the evenings.

808
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,513
Don't try to put a spark in my mind.

809
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,308
Isn't it, Sir'?
- I don't know.

810
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:45,179
I like to believe I'm an old communist.

811
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,299
Doctor knows.

812
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,266
Tham puran had come even yesterday.

813
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:51,133
He said, he liked the kids.

814
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,499
Is it?
- Yes.

815
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,133
But Thampuran is a little upset with you.

816
00:35:55,134 --> 00:35:56,633
Me?
Why is that?

817
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:59,133
One week before he died..

818
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:01,399
He had given money to pay electricity bill..

819
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,666
It seems you did not pay?

820
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:03,766
Who said this?

821
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,699
Thampuran himself!

822
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,166
He doesn't have any complaint.

823
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,599
But little sad, that's all.

824
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,033
<i>Iwill</i> come back soon.

825
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:15,675
Why did you scare the poor guy?

826
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,632
What is this"

827
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:21,204
a dog waiting to pee.

828
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,233
Tapas.

829
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,033
What?

830
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,099
Can we shoot?

831
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,799
Five minutes.

832
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,799
Give me some peace.

833
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,999
OK.

834
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,199
Let him correct the script.

835
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,066
You look more beautiful in short dresses.

836
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:37,099
You were beautiful yesterday.

837
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,999
Thank you.

838
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,633
No mention.

839
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:40,614
Othenlvise she will wear long dresses.

840
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:48,499
She is making me lose control.

841
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Bend a little more.

842
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:55,514
Only then people who are watching will enjoy.

843
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:58,599
This is a good cup.

844
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,599
That is my favourite cup.

845
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,580
That's my dad's gift.

846
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,599
Do I want to support here?

847
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,099
You crazy fellow!

848
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,099
What are you doing?

849
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,466
What are you upto?

850
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,199
What is the issue?

851
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,099
What are you doing Mani uncle!

852
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,099
Let me free.

853
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,199
Do you know who this child is?

854
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,399
They were rehearsing what is there in the
scflpt

855
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,033
Your scriptmrubbish.

856
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,433
Didn't I tell you in the beginning itself?

857
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:29,244
Mani uncle, don't create a
scene and spoil the script.

858
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,233
I am here to solvethe issue.

859
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:34,166
Being a grown up, why don't
you advice these kids..

860
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,299
Instead of playing around?
You idiot.

861
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,066
Did you hear what he called me?
- Mani uncle, please go away.

862
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,499
No child, you don't say anything more.

863
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,433
I can't watch anything more.

864
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:42,766
I am going to call grandmother now.

865
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,332
Enough of your shooting and rubbish.
- Is he mad?

866
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:48,644
I cannot allow such things.

867
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:57,766
I will make him answer for Neeru's tears.

868
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,066
He doesnfiét know me.

869
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,733
I have an extra bone.

870
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:02,632
You have an extra vein, not bone!

871
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:03,566
You get lost.

872
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:05,066
This will not work out"

873
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:05,799
ifthe first day itself is like this.

874
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,633
This will not work out.

875
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,233
We can find a solution for everything.

876
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:09,799
You clear out the confusions in the script now.

877
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,133
You all are my confusions.

878
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:11,466
What?

879
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:13,766
What buffoonery are you all
doing on the first day itself!

880
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:16,399
Did we come all the way to shoot like this?

881
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,599
We can stop it here, if that is the case.

882
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,699
Tapas..words once said and"

883
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,566
weapons once released cannot be taken back.

884
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:22,399
You should remember that.

885
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,233
Go away from here.

886
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,599
Don't worry, we are all with you.

887
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,033
From tomorrow, everything will be OK.

888
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,033
Yes brother, it will be OK.

889
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,533
But what will we do with that person?

890
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:33,399
Including Neeru's dance, we have a lot to
shoot

891
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,399
Neeru, if he creates any further issues..

892
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,399
I swear, <i>lwill</i> beat him.

893
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,999
You want to get rid of him
without causing anyone trouble?

894
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,566
Yes.

895
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,399
I don't think he will go even if he is killed.

896
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,432
Yes.
- We will find out a way.

897
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,433
You give me that.

898
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:50,166
With this bluetooth speaker and the doll we
got.

899
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,699
You will need to create an
atmosphere of black magic.

900
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,999
We can get rid of him today night itself.

901
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,566
He only knows the friend named Raman..

902
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,099
He has started.

903
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,499
He doesn't know the enemy named Anand.

904
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,174
[Humming]

905
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,613
Awappa! Ayyappa!

906
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,066
Lord Ayyappa!

907
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:12,772
Mani"

908
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:14,799
Who is that?

909
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,780
Are you doing good Mani?

910
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:19,674
Don't play games.

911
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:23,248
I like you very much Mani.

912
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,538
Who is that?

913
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,114
Are you coming with me?

914
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:30,506
Why?

915
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:32,738
Who is that?

916
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:34,572
Didn't you hear what I asked?

917
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,233
Haven't you lived enough in this world, Mani?

918
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:41,233
Are you hungry Mani?

919
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:43,233
Come Mani.

920
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:44,633
Mani!

921
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:46,766
[Frightened]

922
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:50,099
Mani how beautiful are you..

923
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,532
Stop talking.
He has reached downstairs.

924
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:52,366
Put offthe bluetooth.

925
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,199
Lower your voice.

926
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,033
Daughter"

927
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:57,766
Where are you all?

928
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,599
Neeru, call him.
- OK.

929
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,366
Child, where are you?

930
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:07,733
Mani uncle, somebody has locked me up in our
car.

931
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:10,033
Neeru is suffocating"

932
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:11,466
Neeru is scared"

933
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,299
Come and save Neeru, Mani uncle.

934
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,666
Oh God! What is happening here?

935
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,133
Is it OK?

936
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:17,399
Why is your slang like this?

937
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,433
Are you a little baby?

938
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:23,233
Child..child...

939
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:24,366
He will now enter into the can.

940
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:27,233
Connect the Bluetooth speaker in the car.

941
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:31,766
[Frightened]

942
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:32,599
Child..

943
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,366
Mani, I knew my evil spirits would bring you
here.

944
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,166
[Frightened]

945
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:39,766
I am thirsty, Mani.

946
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:42,433
Can you give me your blood, Mani?

947
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:48,112
Mani...

948
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,633
Come soon.

949
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:53,466
There he is,lying down.

950
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,499
There he is, lying down.

951
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,275
Don't worry, he is only unconscious.

952
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,466
I want to see his face.

953
00:40:58,467 --> 00:40:59,166
Hold him.

954
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,166
Do it slowly.

955
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,599
Brother, hold him.

956
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,599
Come, we will put him in the well.

957
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,433
You hold him.
I gave only the idea.

958
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:07,199
What an irritating fellow he was!

959
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,799
What all were his demands!

960
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,433
Hold tight.

961
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,099
Grandmother will scold..dress above the knee..

962
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,666
Isn't Neeru innocent?"

963
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,147
Don't you tease Neeru.
- Isn't Neeru sweet?

964
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:25,066
How will I not go when my
grand daughter is not well?

965
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:25,599
That's true.

966
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,033
There is nobody to look after that.

967
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:29,066
Mani uncle, didn't I say, I'm OK here.

968
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:29,566
You go.

969
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:30,799
What is OK here?

970
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,733
Then what about the last night incidents?

971
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:35,433
Are you even more scared than us now?

972
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:38,033
Hearing Tham puran's sound
is just your imagination.

973
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:40,133
It's better not to stay here when you are scared.

974
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:40,466
Do you know why?

975
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:42,566
If you get a heart attack out of fear"

976
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:42,766
Isn't it?

977
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:43,433
That's true.

978
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,666
It's not out of fear.

979
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:45,599
It's my daughter's.

980
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,166
Didn't you tell it's your grand daughter earlier?

981
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:48,133
Now it's daughter?

982
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:49,466
Yes, isn't it my daughter's child?

983
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:49,799
Just shut up.
- OK.

984
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,033
Let him go.
- Dear Mani uncle, we understood.

985
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:54,599
<i>Iwill</i> ensure that she doesn't
wear short dress and"

986
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,799
doesn't touch the guy's while acting.

987
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,266
If you are still not convinced..

988
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,499
I will WhatsApp the photos in
which we don't touch each other.

989
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,433
How is it?

990
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:05,433
I will convince grandmother and father.

991
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:06,766
Mani uncle you please go.

992
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:07,699
Grandmother will not tell anything.

993
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,666
Come shot is ready.

994
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,647
Mani uncle will handle that.

995
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,533
I would have danced like this
if the stage didn't collapse ..

996
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:56,174
During my dance performance
when Iwas in fifth grade.

997
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:41,749
What?
- Tea for everyone please.

998
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:12,434
[Humming..]

999
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,213
[Screaming..]

1000
00:44:57,134 --> 00:45:01,233
Is there any issue now?

1001
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:04,666
Were you screaming since the milk turned
black?

1002
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,666
It might due to many reasons.

1003
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:10,099
Water contamination, problem with milk..

1004
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,099
Even boiling pressure can bethe reason.

1005
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,799
Anu was alone while boiling the milk?

1006
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,799
Yes.

1007
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,533
Why did you ask?

1008
00:45:17,534 --> 00:45:18,766
Just asked.

1009
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:22,099
Nothing like this has happened here before.

1010
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,433
I think this is Thampuran's game.

1011
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,699
He might be angry since you didn't pay the bill.

1012
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,099
Let me go up to the gate.

1013
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,233
There is nobody there.

1014
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:33,666
Let me go and check.
Please move.

1015
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:38,533
Is this any version of psychosis?

1016
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:40,432
I don't think so.

1017
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:41,599
Then it's not what I thought.

1018
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,233
What did you think?

1019
00:45:42,234 --> 00:45:44,766
No, nothing specific.

1020
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:46,266
There is no issue here.

1021
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:49,066
Did you take the milk from here itself?
- Yes.

1022
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:52,233
Some people get such illusions, that's why.

1023
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:55,166
Are you saying, I did it on purpose?

1024
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,766
But, I did not say so.

1025
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,499
A mentalist!

1026
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,299
Hey, Anu..

1027
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,199
You are not the psycho at Madampalli!
- Neeru, can you please come..

1028
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,599
We will com plete the shot.

1029
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,366
Unnecessarily creating issues.

1030
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:10,338
Neeru, where did you learn to dance,
Kalamandalam?

1031
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,410
Sir, one minute.
- Yes?

1032
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,399
I have created a fake FB account 'Thampuran'..

1033
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,433
To scare these guys, with the doll's picture.

1034
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:23,414
<i>Iwill</i> discuss, OK?

1035
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:29,066
What did she say?

1036
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:32,099
Secret.
- Oh!

1037
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,699
Is there a way to make her talk to me?

1038
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,699
Iam slightly frightened to approach her.

1039
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,033
Is it love?

1040
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:38,166
Yes, very much.

1041
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,632
Tomorrow is her eighteenth birthday.

1042
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:43,599
Today night we have planned a surprise party.

1043
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,766
What is that for'?

1044
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:46,799
Will Joffin's father agree forthe marriage?

1045
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,113
How did you know I came after
fighting with my father?

1046
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,632
When Neeru told about his father"

1047
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:58,199
you were disturbed.
Oh!

1048
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,272
You still like your father, isn't it?

1049
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,499
Not at all.

1050
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,099
You should be shot dead.

1051
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,377
Like my father?
Not like, it's love!

1052
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,166
Be careful"

1053
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:42,166
Tell me where you are taking me.

1054
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,147
I will tell, come.

1055
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,505
OK.

1056
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:05,512
Happy Birthday Neeru.

1057
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:10,276
Happy birthday to you"

1058
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:13,499
Happy Birthday to you"

1059
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,766
Happy birthday, dear Neeru..

1060
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:21,299
Happy Birthday to you"

1061
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,304
Many many happy returns ofthe day.

1062
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,266
Thank you.

1063
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:27,133
Wonderful.

1064
00:48:27,134 --> 00:48:29,637
Supercallifragilisticexpialidocious!
- Yes, of course.

1065
00:48:29,734 --> 00:48:31,099
Marv Poppins!

1066
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,199
Neeru, I did all these arrangements.

1067
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,339
Thank you so much.

1068
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,176
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1069
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:45,709
Happy birthday!

1070
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:46,433
Why is he here?

1071
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:47,766
Eighteen is the smartest age.

1072
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:47,801
Happy birthday.

1073
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:47,801
Happy birthday.
Eighteen is the smartest age.

1074
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,013
Is it the same?
Don't you know seeing this?

1075
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:59,278
It's the same.Thank you.

1076
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,413
Didn't I ask him to tell ideas like this?

1077
00:49:04,467 --> 00:49:05,599
Rascal.

1078
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,099
He won't tell you.

1079
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,399
From ancient times, Mentalists are a mistery.

1080
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,266
Especially him.

1081
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:15,147
Is it over?
OK.

1082
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:16,599
Can we cut the cake?

1083
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,580
OK.

1084
00:49:24,734 --> 00:49:29,734
Happy birthday to you.

1085
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,499
[Frightened]

1086
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,500
What is this?

1087
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,233
Burnt.

1088
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:42,443
What is happening?

1089
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:57,466
Throw it away.

1090
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:00,971
Are you OK?

1091
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:01,705
Neeru, are you OK?

1092
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:02,399
Shutyour mouth.

1093
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,299
How many times did I tell
you not to buy snow spray?

1094
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:04,505
Come.

1095
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:05,375
Many accidents have happened
who used this to celebrate.

1096
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:07,466
There are many videos in you tube.

1097
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:08,066
Did you direct those?

1098
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:09,066
No, you father directed it.

1099
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:10,466
G o away.

1100
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,266
Did he also abused my father?

1101
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:13,644
Are all satisfied when someone abused my
father..

1102
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,733
After conducting an event at night?

1103
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:17,233
But, I did not buythis gun.

1104
00:50:17,234 --> 00:50:18,099
Gun..Go away.

1105
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,170
Then shoot me with this.

1106
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,073
I shotthis thinking of using
it forthe short film.

1107
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:56,166
Everything has gone waste now.

1108
00:50:56,167 --> 00:51:00,233
What is Tapas's short filmfiés story line?

1109
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:02,799
It's starting with a normal
friend's reunion story.

1110
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,332
We slowly realise that there is a ghost.

1111
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,232
Oh, is there horror element?

1112
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:08,466
Then what will the ghost do to you?

1113
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:10,066
It's a friendly ghost.
OK.

1114
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,399
Instead of scaring us away"

1115
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,233
it runs away from us.
That's the story.

1116
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:14,599
Really nice.

1117
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,066
Will all your FB friends come for 31st
screening?

1118
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:20,047
Most ofthe lD's in our group are fake.

1119
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,532
But it's afun group.

1120
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:23,533
Many have agreed to come.

1121
00:51:23,534 --> 00:51:27,633
Sir, Iwould like to add some
mentalism into the storyline.

1122
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:29,632
Would you be able to help?

1123
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,266
Why not?

1124
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:33,766
A mentalist is already there in the story, Tapas?

1125
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:35,747
Thank you, Sir.
OK.

1126
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,066
It's now become a problem..

1127
00:51:59,067 --> 00:52:01,172
To allow the kids to stay here, isn't it?

1128
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:04,466
Do you sense anything?

1129
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,466
Yes.

1130
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:08,466
A disturbed soul.

1131
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:10,466
Who?

1132
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:12,447
I don't know.

1133
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:16,047
But it's powerful.

1134
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,466
That kid is it's target, Niranjana.

1135
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:23,447
But why?

1136
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,599
There is a reason for everything that.

1137
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,733
Has been happening here forthe last 2 days.

1138
00:52:27,734 --> 00:52:31,648
I will ask them to shift today itself.

1139
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:35,766
If we do so..

1140
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:38,680
We can only avoid a tragedy here.

1141
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,680
But it will happen.

1142
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,099
If it is to help the kid..

1143
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,980
We will need to find out the past.

1144
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,373
Tell.
- Three, Six, Five, Seven, Eight.

1145
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,566
[Su rprised]

1146
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:05,547
One more.

1147
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,199
Triangle.

1148
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,199
How do you do this?

1149
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,666
It's not necessary to see.

1150
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:20,499
Hearing is as important as vision.

1151
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,499
Each letter has a specific sound.

1152
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,699
Now Neeru give a try.

1153
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,699
Give me.
- OK.

1154
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:31,582
Just listen to the sound. OK?

1155
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,610
Tell.
- Square?

1156
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:39,766
Is it correct?
Really?

1157
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:41,666
Now you learnt all mentalism!

1158
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:43,599
Now something else.
- We will see another one tomorrow.

1159
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,399
This is enough for the time being.

1160
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,399
OK.

1161
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,099
Neeru's schooling was in Delhi?

1162
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,499
Yes, in Delhi, as far as I can remember.

1163
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:52,766
OK.

1164
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,599
My parent's was a love marriage.

1165
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,266
Initially it was an issue..

1166
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:58,033
But now both families are happy.

1167
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:58,599
OK.

1168
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,599
What's yourfuture plan?

1169
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,599
Do you love someone?

1170
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,533
No, I don't have time for such nonsense.

1171
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,733
I need to do PhD in contemporary dance
abroad"

1172
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:12,433
And start a dance school after coming back.

1173
00:54:12,434 --> 00:54:14,433
Good, good.

1174
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:16,414
Raman, Joffin, what are you doing there?

1175
00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:19,199
Come over.

1176
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,366
Don't push, you rascal.

1177
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:24,033
He found us!

1178
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:25,666
Didn't I tell you that he will find us.

1179
00:54:25,667 --> 00:54:27,666
How did you know we are here.

1180
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:28,632
I smelled you.

1181
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:29,366
Smell?

1182
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:30,666
Is he a dog to find using smell?

1183
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,666
But, I have not used perfume!

1184
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:34,599
Perfume is not required for that.

1185
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,599
Sweat of each person has it's own smell.

1186
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,633
Isn't your deo 'playboy', Raman?

1187
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:41,466
Very bad.

1188
00:54:41,467 --> 00:54:43,299
Yes.

1189
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,299
Neeru, have you not seen them before?

1190
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,766
No.

1191
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:47,133
Not even a phone call?

1192
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:47,999
No.

1193
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,466
That was the thrilling part for me to come here.

1194
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:52,447
Totally strangers get together.

1195
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,099
Shall I ask you one thing?

1196
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:55,766
Yes.

1197
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:57,766
Can you see ghost?

1198
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,399
Yes, I can see you.

1199
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,266
[Teasing]

1200
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:03,199
Not that, when I googled you..

1201
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,079
I read about one ortwo psychic experiences.

1202
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:09,306
Can you actually see ghosts?

1203
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,432
Yes.

1204
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:15,413
[Alarmed]

1205
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:18,175
How could you see?

1206
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,733
That's a flash back.

1207
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,769
Would there be a lag?

1208
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,999
Do not know.

1209
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,199
I can tell if you are interested.

1210
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,599
I am not so interested.

1211
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,266
Yes, tell us.

1212
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:32,666
There was a girl 'Angelina' who..

1213
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,666
Studied with me in the orphanage.

1214
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:37,079
She liked my magic.

1215
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,980
She died when we were in 10th grade.

1216
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,266
Only when she died..

1217
00:55:42,267 --> 00:55:45,599
I realised that how much I loved her.

1218
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,566
Then?

1219
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:49,133
Then what?

1220
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:51,114
I went into depression for sometime.

1221
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:54,166
It's because I wanted to talkto her again"

1222
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:57,166
I started this mentalism and paranormal
activity.

1223
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,307
Do you talk to Angelina still?

1224
00:56:01,267 --> 00:56:02,302
Yes.

1225
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:08,167
Death is actually similar to the birth of a child.

1226
00:56:08,267 --> 00:56:10,233
In their new world..

1227
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:13,499
There will be confusion, tension and fear.

1228
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,499
Itry to help them out.

1229
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,604
That's all.

1230
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:20,446
Anyone here has come for help?

1231
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:24,738
No one has come asking for help.

1232
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,080
Si f?

1233
00:56:32,467 --> 00:56:34,466
Did you understand what he said?

1234
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:36,466
I didn't understand.

1235
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:38,266
One ofthe three articles in the world..

1236
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:39,799
That no one understands is his!

1237
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,333
Yes.

1238
00:56:40,334 --> 00:56:42,299
But nothing in his head.

1239
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,337
[Scared]

1240
00:56:50,734 --> 00:56:52,433
Is this enough?

1241
00:56:52,434 --> 00:56:53,733
This is superb..

1242
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:55,433
But if we have to use it in the film..

1243
00:56:55,434 --> 00:56:57,099
One of us will have to learn and perform.

1244
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,499
Else it won't be convinced.

1245
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,099
What can we do forthat?

1246
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,099
I don't know that.

1247
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,671
But, won't he teach mentalism only to girls?

1248
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:07,433
<i>Raman and Joffin can do.</i>

1249
00:57:07,434 --> 00:57:09,066
But it will take minimum 10 years.

1250
00:57:09,067 --> 00:57:11,066
I will not be available for so long.

1251
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:13,047
[Excited]

1252
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:32,499
Hey, if you can come a little faster"

1253
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,638
we could take a shot here.

1254
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:37,666
What is this"

1255
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:41,666
Is this the Goddess herself in front of me?

1256
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,799
Isn't this the dialogue I wanted to say?

1257
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,399
Yes.

1258
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,666
To think othewvise, have you met Goddess
before?

1259
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:49,266
Is it?

1260
00:57:49,267 --> 00:57:51,766
Sorry, if I offended you.

1261
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:53,399
It's OK.

1262
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,399
It's not OK.

1263
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,399
All these are his idea.

1264
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,699
First quarrel, then patch up..

1265
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,770
Next is love.

1266
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:04,233
How fast did you all become thick friends.

1267
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:05,799
Were you all together in school or college"

1268
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,133
or is there any connection between parents?

1269
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:09,299
Didn't I tell 'No' in Malayalam earlier?

1270
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,266
This coir..

1271
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:11,766
Only ifthere is any in our previous birth.

1272
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:13,166
Anyways, not in this birth.

1273
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:15,266
So Anu, do you believe in after birth?

1274
00:58:15,267 --> 00:58:15,799
Of course.

1275
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,766
A warrior often comes in my dream.

1276
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:19,033
It would be Manju Warrier!

1277
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:20,233
What?

1278
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:21,733
Anyways, I am going to the hospital.

1279
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:24,233
I will teach you a simple trick that you can do.

1280
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:24,599
OK.

1281
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,699
I am starting 'Rakthamokshafl

1282
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,399
What motion?

1283
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,233
Is it loose motion?
- Rakthadooshya'

1284
00:58:28,234 --> 00:58:30,066
It's not that.

1285
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:31,799
Rakthamoksha is the first stage of Kayakalpa.

1286
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,599
OK.

1287
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,599
Anyway, let me leave.

1288
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,133
You take care, Anu.

1289
00:58:36,134 --> 00:58:38,099
[Smiles]

1290
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,671
Mr. John..

1291
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,073
Can you stop torturing me like this?

1292
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,780
You cannot, is it?

1293
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:52,333
<i>Iwill</i> try not to.

1294
00:58:52,334 --> 00:58:53,210
What?

1295
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,633
You don't worry.

1296
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:59,566
I have a good idea to expose his stupid
mentalism.

1297
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:01,566
Is it?
- Yes.

1298
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:04,099
He is using magic equipments.

1299
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,080
For all his mentalism programs.

1300
00:59:07,334 --> 00:59:09,633
The finger cots, sticking gel..

1301
00:59:09,634 --> 00:59:11,166
And many otherthings Iikethat.

1302
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,999
Everything will be there in his room.

1303
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,999
Is he stepping inside after marriage?

1304
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,999
OK.

1305
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,499
Slowly, close the door.

1306
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,199
OK.

1307
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,066
Be careful.

1308
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:23,068
I will take care.

1309
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:27,714
What is this?

1310
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,532
[Trying to open]

1311
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:32,666
[Scared]

1312
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:33,433
What?

1313
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:35,633
He wears undenlvear too, Hush Puppies.

1314
00:59:35,634 --> 00:59:37,399
Did we come here to find this?

1315
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,133
Go and check.

1316
00:59:38,134 --> 00:59:38,799
You take it if you want.

1317
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,733
Don'tgive to him.

1318
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:41,199
Is he going to be a Buddhist?

1319
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,199
The room is full of Buddha.

1320
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,233
It's not a big deal.

1321
00:59:43,234 --> 00:59:45,632
Every fraud intellecfs house
will have such a thing.

1322
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:46,799
It's there in my house too.

1323
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,433
There is nothing in this?

1324
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:54,033
What is this?

1325
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:55,766
A lid.

1326
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:57,333
It's all a gimmick.

1327
00:59:57,334 --> 00:59:59,099
Brother"

1328
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,433
Check these items of mental asylum.

1329
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:02,166
Did you see this?

1330
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,766
Empty book, showing as voracious reader"

1331
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:04,599
I won't see.
Look at what I showed you first.

1332
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,366
This is to keep the undenlvear"

1333
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:06,599
Didn't I tell you to take the undenlvean.

1334
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,466
Then why are you bargaining?

1335
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:09,466
What is that noise?

1336
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:12,199
Who told you to put on the fan?

1337
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,433
Idid not put iton.

1338
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:14,199
Go, put it off.

1339
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,566
He will spoil all of this.

1340
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:17,433
Forgot about why we came here
for when you got the undenlvear!

1341
01:00:17,434 --> 01:00:19,433
He will not wear that too.

1342
01:00:19,434 --> 01:00:20,766
These switches are all off already!

1343
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:21,677
What?

1344
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:26,066
What is this?

1345
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:29,533
Where were all these papers?

1346
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:31,366
What is happening?

1347
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:32,599
I don't know.

1348
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,299
[Scared]

1349
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,599
Come, we will go.

1350
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,099
Open it.

1351
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,299
I am not able to open!

1352
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,033
Open it the way you did it earlier"

1353
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:43,333
ldon't know to open it from inside.

1354
01:00:43,334 --> 01:00:44,244
I am suffocating.

1355
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,299
My hands and legs are shivering.

1356
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,599
[Frightened]

1357
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,599
There is a way, come.

1358
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,433
[Screaming]

1359
01:00:53,434 --> 01:00:54,399
Hello..

1360
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,400
My leg..[Screaming]

1361
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,415
Help me instead of falling unconscious.

1362
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:17,299
[crying]

1363
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,699
Nothing to weep like this.lts only a small injury.

1364
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,699
No its serious

1365
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,699
Iwas saved since I fell
unconscious at the right time.

1366
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,599
IdiotlYou are responsible for all this.

1367
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,599
He forced me to enter that room.

1368
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,482
Oh Kattappa is back after
his lose motion treatment.

1369
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:39,600
Did you come to check if we died?

1370
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:41,633
Why did you try to enter my room?

1371
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:46,099
Sorry sir.They made a mistake.

1372
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,099
Have you done mentalism on that fan in your
room?

1373
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,766
Was that some kind of a room security system
sir?

1374
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:54,766
Hmm..

1375
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,766
Does anyone keep security system on fan leaf?

1376
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:58,508
What if we had died?

1377
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,266
In Trivandrum medical college a patient body was
cut into two with a similar fan blade accident.

1378
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:04,633
Oh!Did he survive anu?

1379
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:06,671
No.He lived with 2 bodies!

1380
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:08,199
Its our mistake sir.

1381
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,199
Please don't misunderstand us.

1382
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,441
Anyway 50W-

1383
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:17,534
This Mannadiar is not a Sudra
or Vysya to forget or pardon"

1384
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:20,433
if you say sorry like this.
I am a Kshatriya'.

1385
01:02:20,434 --> 01:02:21,633
Isn't this lkka's dialogue?

1386
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:24,266
I will return it back to you when you need it?

1387
01:02:24,267 --> 01:02:26,233
Anu, can you massage on my back?

1388
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:28,233
You better do it yourself!

1389
01:02:28,234 --> 01:02:30,214
Anu..l do not need a massage on my back.

1390
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:31,537
Cut it.

1391
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,199
Is it OK?

1392
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,133
This is superb!

1393
01:03:36,134 --> 01:03:38,433
We have completed almost fifty
percent scenes of 'lnterval'.

1394
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:39,266
Is it?

1395
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:43,733
Then instead of interval,
can we display 'The End' here?

1396
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:45,543
Itwill be something unique.

1397
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,599
That calls for a celebration.

1398
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,433
Yes, I have brought the best thing for that.

1399
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:51,033
Is it?

1400
01:03:51,034 --> 01:03:52,499
From now we will shoot fast.

1401
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,799
Improvisation, that is cinema for me.

1402
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,433
If it goes like this, I doubt he will go mad.

1403
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:58,099
Isn't it, Neeru?

1404
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,399
Your daddy is crazy.

1405
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,402
That's true, my father is anyway crazy.

1406
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,166
Arak Bali!

1407
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:12,999
Where were you hiding this?

1408
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,599
Be careful, it's a mystic drink.

1409
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,799
The kick is different for each person drinking.

1410
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,643
Don't make me fall for it, brother.

1411
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,478
What isthis thing!

1412
01:04:24,534 --> 01:04:26,266
Food pipe has become like national highway!

1413
01:04:26,267 --> 01:04:29,233
It is even used to drive the evil spirits in Bali.

1414
01:04:29,234 --> 01:04:30,766
No wonder it has an evil taste!

1415
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,474
Then you better not drink.

1416
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:34,799
If that girl only has the problem..

1417
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,466
What about the accident that
happened in this room, John?

1418
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:40,066
I was wrong.

1419
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:42,266
It has come for all of them.

1420
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:46,233
But, they have nothing in common.

1421
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:50,614
That makes this the toughest case.

1422
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:53,599
Is the download over?
- It will be over now.

1423
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,033
We will see Shahrukh Khan's new movie here.

1424
01:04:55,034 --> 01:04:56,066
I don't want to see.

1425
01:04:56,067 --> 01:04:57,033
<i>Iwill</i> watch it in theater.

1426
01:04:57,034 --> 01:04:59,799
Shahruk Khan doesn't need your money to live!

1427
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,566
That's it.

1428
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:03,299
My dear Neeru, it's not an issue if malayalees.

1429
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,299
But it wrong if North Indians do.

1430
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,280
That's crime.

1431
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:11,099
<i>Iwill</i> come now.

1432
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,376
Should Icome?
- No.

1433
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:18,577
Tapas, come out of the water.

1434
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,199
This will get over.

1435
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,476
I cannot have this alone.

1436
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,999
Tapas, come up.
Stop playing.

1437
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,166
The movie download will be complete now.

1438
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:35,599
Tapas, don't play game.

1439
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,080

1441

Hey, jump and save him.

1442

I don't know to swim, you go and save.

1443
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,766

Rub his leg..

1457
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,099
What happened?
- Tapas?

1458
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,099
Why is he not opening his eyes?

1459
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:30,599
Slowly..

1460
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,366
It's OK.

1461
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:33,233
Open your eyes.

1462
01:06:33,234 --> 01:06:36,166
How many times have I warned
you not to step in the pond?

1463
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:38,166
Tapas.
Take him up.

1464
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:40,166
Oh, God!

1465
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:43,433
You scared us, rascal.

1466
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:45,366
Rub the other leg.

1467
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:46,732
What happened?

1468
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,733
Move a little..let him get some air.

1469
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:50,441
What happened?

1470
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,176
Press his stomach.
- How did it happen?

1471
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:59,766
Take him to the hospital soon, Unni..

1472
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:02,033
Hold him.

1473
01:07:02,034 --> 01:07:04,674

The one who got drowned after drinking
alcohol.

01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:23,033
Now I am fine sir.

1481
01:08:23,034 --> 01:08:24,166
What happened was my mistake.

1482
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,166
We don't have any complaint sir.

1483
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:28,699
What if you had died?

1484
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,366
It would've been a problem for us.

1485
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:34,799
It's the duty of the police to enquire
accidents reported from hospital.

1486
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,699
Sir.

1487
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,432
The biggest shame of this Nation are
irresponsible youths like you.

1488
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:41,766
Please don't tell that sir.

1489
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:45,766
During theflood only youths like us
were available for relief work 24/7.

1490
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:46,575
Stop it.

1491
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:52,200
In the pretext of shooting boys
and girls are having fun here.

1492
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:55,033
Did you thinkthis is a place for that?

1493
01:08:55,034 --> 01:08:56,035
Did you ask for me?

1494
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,999
Are you staying here for
Kayakalpa treatm ent?

1495
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,366
Isn't the hospital in town?

1496
01:09:02,367 --> 01:09:04,699
I will move to hospital at the
next stage of the treatment.

1497
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,799
I have seen you somewhere.

1498
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,099
No chance.

1499
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,566
He is a Mentalist.

1500
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:12,999
What mentalist?
All are frauds.

1501
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,066
Sir please don't make any problem.

1502
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,133
Venu doctor will come now.

1503
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:16,499
Who is he to make a difference?

1504
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,599
Iam aware of all the illegal
activities happening here.

1505
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,599
Now you started lodging people here!

1506
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,999
It is not like that Sir.

1507
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,138
What's not like that?

1508
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,233
First let me finish this.

1509
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:28,099
You wait here.

1510
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,633
What is yourjob other than film making.

1511
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,533
I am an engineer in Hyderabad.

1512
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,239
Is it?

1513
01:09:34,267 --> 01:09:35,566
I have an hotel business.

1514
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:36,299
Did I ask you?

1515
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,066
You would anyway ask.

1516
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:40,047
Sorry Sir.

1517
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,609
What is yourjob other than shooting?

1518
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:50,632
Didn't you hear me?

1519
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:51,668
Iam a nurse.

1520
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,499
Where?

1521
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,570
Kottayam.

1522
01:09:56,634 --> 01:09:58,633
Where in Kottayam?

1523
01:09:58,634 --> 01:10:00,133
Medical center.

1524
01:10:00,134 --> 01:10:02,499
So Australia?

1525
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,499
Is there Kottayam in Australia?

1526
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,466
WhatAustralia?

1527
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:08,500
Shetold us..

1528
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:10,412
What did she tell?

1529
01:10:11,267 --> 01:10:13,269
What?

1530
01:10:13,401 --> 01:10:15,210
Why are you blabbering?

1531
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,340
Your routine is not proper
since wife left, isn't it?

1532
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,599
What?

1533
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,206
It's been a month you
got punishment transfer"

1534
01:10:34,267 --> 01:10:37,043
for unnecessarily getting
involved in nurse's strike.

1535
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:38,205
Is it not?

1536
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:44,610
Ask them to change the mirror
bulb at your hotel.

1537
01:10:46,434 --> 01:10:51,213
Is finding this hair, Mentalism?

1538
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:54,499
Sir, the kids are genuine.

1539
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,266
Isn't this a normal incident Sir'?

1540
01:10:56,267 --> 01:10:58,266
Please leave it.

1541
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:00,247
Take your hand.

1542
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:10,274
Rub offthe kajal of the lady
constable from your neck.

1543
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:14,707
Isn't it a shame if others see?

1544
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:43,105
Finding this hair is also Mentalism.

1545
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:49,166
When you who administers the law, is breaking
it..

1546
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:51,633
Isn't it unfair to accuse these kids?

1547
01:11:51,634 --> 01:11:53,614
Let them go.

1548
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:04,499
OK, OK, I understand.

1549
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,666
Anyway, since he is begging so much..

1550
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:08,200
I am not taking action for now.

1551
01:12:08,201 --> 01:12:11,666
But, if anything like this happens further"

1552
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:13,500
I will shut down this place.

1553
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:15,499
Did you hear?
- Yes.

1554
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,266
Come.

1555
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:18,266
OK then.
- OK.

1556
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:21,799
Why did you lie to us, Anu?

1557
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,566
Did you think of making us fools?

1558
01:12:24,567 --> 01:12:26,547
Why don't you speak?

1559
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,333
Enough of shooting.

1560
01:12:36,334 --> 01:12:38,066
It's only issues after we came here.

1561
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:39,100
Now this.

1562
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:41,099
Iam fed up.

1563
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,266
Me too.

1564
01:12:42,267 --> 01:12:45,399
There is some mystery about this
place, the bald person etc.

1565
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,399
I strongly doubt she is also part of it.

1566
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,366
Did you all notice"

1567
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:51,099
When the accident happened, where did she
go?

1568
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,633
Anu went to take the camera.

1569
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,133
Whatever, I am scared"

1570
01:12:54,134 --> 01:12:55,399
lam quitting.

1571
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,399
We will stop the shoot here.

1572
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,266
Brother, you tell that my character is dead..

1573
01:12:59,267 --> 01:13:01,247
And adjust with a photo.

1574
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:06,766
Her Australia, divorce, what not.

1575
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:08,766
She was justjoking, OK.

1576
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:09,799
Is this a joke?

1577
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,499
Why is she not telling anything now?

1578
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,233
Actually, I will go to Melbourne
ifthe visa is cleared.

1579
01:13:15,234 --> 01:13:17,466
Then, why did you say you are divorced?

1580
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:20,066
Since <i>lwill</i> be staying with strangers"

1581
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:22,666
I thought it will be safe
if I said I was a divorcee.

1582
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:23,599
Wonderful.

1583
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,433
Who told you will be safe if
you told you are a divorcee?

1584
01:13:26,434 --> 01:13:28,133
These guys will be interested to drive..

1585
01:13:28,134 --> 01:13:29,799
If they know it they have license to.

1586
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,400
Take your ID card"

1587
01:13:31,401 --> 01:13:32,299
I don't trust anyone.

1588
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,299
Can you stop it.

1589
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,433
This short film was developed
after a planning of 5 years.

1590
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:38,766
I don't know if I will have the initiative"

1591
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:41,433
to co-ordinate even if If I get another 5 years.

1592
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:42,599
Even ifl have"

1593
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,600
we all will be at different places.

1594
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:46,999
Anyway, we have reached so far..

1595
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,599
If we shoot for anothertwo, three days"

1596
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,099
Can't we finish it?

1597
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,100
Post production and New year screening"

1598
01:13:52,101 --> 01:13:53,466
let it be anything"

1599
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:55,466
can't we wait for 2 more days?

1600
01:13:55,467 --> 01:13:56,499
Please?

1601
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,480
I am ready.

1602
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:17,199
In our group, it's more of fake lD's.

1603
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,180
But it's afun group.

1604
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,108
Sir..

1605
01:14:29,267 --> 01:14:33,599
Is there a way to return back
this money to Thampuran?

1606
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,672
I don't know if this is more or less.

1607
01:14:38,234 --> 01:14:40,566
I doubt if my wrong action"

1608
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:42,774
is the reason for all the issues happenings now.

1609
01:14:45,534 --> 01:14:47,300
To your knowledge, other than Thampuran's..

1610
01:14:47,301 --> 01:14:50,799
Did any other un-natural death happen here?

1611
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,406
No. Why?

1612
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:56,166
Nothing.

1613
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,166
What should I do with this?

1614
01:14:58,167 --> 01:15:00,579
Shall I give it to thetemple?

1615
01:15:01,634 --> 01:15:04,000
Give it to any needy.

1616
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,766
Thampuran's anger will go if I do so, isn't it?

1617
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:07,366
Yes.

1618
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:09,433
It's time for my medicine.

1619
01:15:09,434 --> 01:15:10,733
I forgot about that.

1620
01:15:10,734 --> 01:15:11,712
<i>Iwill</i> bring it now.

1621
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:27,333
That SI has newly taken charge here.

1622
01:15:27,334 --> 01:15:28,433
Young blood.

1623
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:30,666
We can't blame him too.

1624
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:32,533
He was only doing his duty.

1625
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:34,514
I told the same to SP.

1626
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:42,267
Initially, police had issues even
in allowing visitors with tickets.

1627
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,099
Later it got cleared.

1628
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,774
With this, the maintenance will go smoothly.

1629
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:53,281
What are you thinking?

1630
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:58,366
There is a common factor between all ofthem.

1631
01:15:58,367 --> 01:16:00,366
What is it?

1632
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:03,099
There are some vital links..

1633
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,366
That we tend to neglect in many cases.

1634
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:09,266
Make it clear.

1635
01:16:09,267 --> 01:16:11,800
Isn't the online group where they..

1636
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:15,733
Met and made them get together?

1637
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:18,299
So what?

1638
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,299
That's the connection.

1639
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,299
What connection?

1640
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,800
The presence that came in search of them..

1641
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:27,543
Might have come from there itself?

1642
01:17:13,534 --> 01:17:15,600
John, where are you?

1643
01:17:15,601 --> 01:17:17,599
Are you busy?

1644
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,433
Yes.

1645
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,300
Never mind. I need a help.

1646
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:21,433
What happened?

1647
01:17:21,434 --> 01:17:23,166
I need details of a Facebook group.

1648
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:24,266
At the earliest.

1649
01:17:24,267 --> 01:17:26,466
We are here to investigate cyber crimes.

1650
01:17:26,467 --> 01:17:28,299
What is the role of a mentalist there?

1651
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,300
Hey, I am serious.

1652
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:32,299
OK.

1653
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,733
<i>Iwill</i> email my queries.

1654
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:36,433
When will you be able to
give a correct information?

1655
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:38,433
Tomorrow, by end ofthe day.

1656
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:39,533
Is that OK?

1657
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:41,514
OK, fine.

1658
01:17:43,767 --> 01:17:45,566
OK.
Is it OK?

1659
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:47,299
Where is she? Light is going down.

1660
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,266
Neeru..
Yes?

1661
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:49,733
Where is Anu? What is happening?

1662
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:52,166
I called her many times.
She is not coming.

1663
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,566
I feel like beating her up.

1664
01:17:53,567 --> 01:17:56,133
I feel irritated at the sight of her now.

1665
01:17:56,134 --> 01:17:59,133
Hall is also booked for
screening at Kochi on 31st.

1666
01:17:59,134 --> 01:18:00,733
Many in the group has confirmed their arrival.

1667
01:18:00,734 --> 01:18:01,799
After completing the shoot.

1668
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,400
Don't we need to do music, editing
and entire post production?

1669
01:18:03,401 --> 01:18:04,533
What will we do, if she doesnfiét co-operate?

1670
01:18:04,534 --> 01:18:08,133
Tapas, issue isn't happening
between a right and a wrong.

1671
01:18:08,134 --> 01:18:09,633
It's between a right and a right.

1672
01:18:09,634 --> 01:18:10,266
What?

1673
01:18:10,267 --> 01:18:11,199
You give a thought.

1674
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,266
By the time I will bring her.

1675
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:14,109
I will also come.

1676
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:30,700
Anu..

1677
01:18:30,701 --> 01:18:32,466
What is your problem?

1678
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:33,499
Hey..

1679
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,699
I have no problem.

1680
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,333
I have only asked for some time
to mentally prepare forthe shot.

1681
01:18:37,334 --> 01:18:40,666
To mentally prepare, are you doing the
role of Shobhana in Manichitrthazhu?

1682
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:42,400
Don't tell too much..

1683
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:44,066
This is the time of 'Me too' campaign.

1684
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:47,266
Tapas, Anu..listen to me..

1685
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:50,066
Our life is too short"

1686
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:52,433
we are here only for a very short time.

1687
01:18:52,434 --> 01:18:53,766
In between, a bigger"

1688
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:54,699
Sorry.

1689
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,266
What is the point in carrying a bigger ego?

1690
01:18:57,267 --> 01:18:59,066
Neeru, listen without crying.
- True.

1691
01:18:59,067 --> 01:18:59,599
OK.

1692
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Forget everything and give a handshake.

1693
01:19:01,601 --> 01:19:04,233
Give a handshake.

1694
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:06,466
Give Anu, you mischievous girl.

1695
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:09,100
That's it. Happy now isn't it?

1696
01:19:09,101 --> 01:19:11,099
Aren't you haPPV7

1697
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,466
We can make Christmas cake today.

1698
01:19:12,467 --> 01:19:14,066
Anu makes super cakes.

1699
01:19:14,067 --> 01:19:16,599
Oh, won't her mood be alright soon?

1700
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:21,233
<i>Iwill</i> make our life full of compromises.

1701
01:19:21,234 --> 01:19:24,333
I have collected the details John asked for.

1702
01:19:24,334 --> 01:19:26,333
Are you free now?

1703
01:19:26,334 --> 01:19:28,314
I'm sharing my desktop, one sec.

1704
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:34,366
Satheesh, no calls for next 30 minutes please.

1705
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:35,038
Thank you.

1706
01:19:36,634 --> 01:19:37,544
Yes, John.

1707
01:19:38,234 --> 01:19:39,542
Got it.

1708
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:43,776
There are 1,46,000 members in this group.

1709
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:47,033
86,565 active members, isn't it?

1710
01:19:47,034 --> 01:19:50,466
There will be duplicate and fake lD's in that.

1711
01:19:50,467 --> 01:19:52,800
Out of this, cases as per cyber law..

1712
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:55,766
Has been charged against 856 members.

1713
01:19:55,767 --> 01:19:57,766
So many ofthem?

1714
01:19:57,767 --> 01:20:00,133
Now a days, case will be
charged for silly reasons.

1715
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:01,733
If one puts an offensive comment or

1716
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:04,133
if someone puts a provoking post.

1717
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:06,133
Most cases are like this.

1718
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:09,333
Meera, how many out of 856 have been
punished?

1719
01:20:09,334 --> 01:20:11,575
That, I will have to check. One minute.

01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,499

I have added their list.

1722
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:24,533
Meera, out of this 78 members..

1723
01:20:24,534 --> 01:20:26,533
Who are not alive?

1724
01:20:26,534 --> 01:20:29,799
We will have to approach native station forthat.

1725
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,543
I only have the details till
the last Iogin details.

1726
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,366
OK Meera, Thank you.

1727
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:39,100
Hey John, wait.

1728
01:20:39,101 --> 01:20:41,099
Yes?

1729
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,099
This is interesting.

1730
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:43,669
What?

1731
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,400
We had de-activated the 78 lD's..

1732
01:20:47,401 --> 01:20:49,381
When the case was registered.

1733
01:20:49,601 --> 01:20:50,999
Se?

1734
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,266
One of the lD's is active.

1735
01:20:53,267 --> 01:20:55,666
But, I am not ableto track the IP.

1736
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:56,766
I don't know why.

1737
01:20:56,767 --> 01:20:58,766
Which one?

1738
01:20:58,767 --> 01:21:01,333
Before de-activating"

1739
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:03,566
where was it last logged in?

1740
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,266
That I'll find out.

1741
01:21:05,267 --> 01:21:07,566
Anyways, I'll share the FB profile link.

1742
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:09,547
OK?
- OK.

1743
01:22:23,767 --> 01:22:26,566
We will build a small house
like this in Australia.

1744
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,133
No, it's OK if that's at Kottayam.

1745
01:22:28,134 --> 01:22:29,166
How was my acting?

1746
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,733
It is as usual.

1747
01:22:32,734 --> 01:22:34,333
How did you know the officer..

1748
01:22:34,334 --> 01:22:36,333
Was divorced and staying in a hotel?

1749
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:39,499
He had a mark of the wedding ring removed.

1750
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,200
Moreover, the hotel key was in his pants
pocket.

1751
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:42,566
Is it?

1752
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:45,400
Poor fellow, he is in frustration after divorce.

1753
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:48,400
Then, how did you know about
his punishment transfer'?

1754
01:22:48,401 --> 01:22:51,099
Google..l googled him.

1755
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,100
Everything cannot be found out with
mentalism.

1756
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,466
See, didn't Itell you brothel'?

1757
01:22:55,467 --> 01:22:57,266
Thank you.
- Why?

1758
01:22:57,267 --> 01:22:58,266
If John had not been there..

1759
01:22:58,267 --> 01:23:00,266
Iwould have been caught by the police.

1760
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,233
Can we shoot the climax"

1761
01:23:01,234 --> 01:23:02,299
Light is going down.

1762
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,699
All of you come.

1763
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,271
Why is everyone getting message at the same
time?

1764
01:23:08,434 --> 01:23:11,099
'My story is not finished, Mayflower.'

1765
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:11,733
What is this?

1766
01:23:11,734 --> 01:23:13,599
I have also got the same message!

1767
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,799
What is this flower?

1768
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
Isn't My Story, our Prithviraj movie?

1769
01:23:16,801 --> 01:23:18,799
This is a private number.

1770
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,766
There is some issue.

1771
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:22,033
That might be some junk message.

1772
01:23:22,034 --> 01:23:23,099
We will shoot.

1773
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,466
Bring that camera.

1774
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:25,233
Come here.

1775
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:28,272
If he touch the camera, film will be a flop.

1776
01:23:41,334 --> 01:23:43,333
What's news?

1777
01:23:43,334 --> 01:23:45,233
Work is going well, isn't it?

1778
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:45,644
Yes.

1779
01:23:46,434 --> 01:23:51,179
I am trying to get yourjob ready.

1780
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:57,247
Hello, grandmother"

1781
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
Oh, charge is over.

1782
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:03,266
Grandmother has come to Guruvayur temple.

1783
01:24:03,267 --> 01:24:05,400
I came to take Neeru.

1784
01:24:05,401 --> 01:24:07,733
Grandmother will get tensed
if she doesn't get the call.

1785
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:09,066
What will I do?

1786
01:24:09,067 --> 01:24:10,599
Call from my phone.

1787
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,000
Do you have phone?

1788
01:24:12,001 --> 01:24:12,599
Yes.

1789
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Wonderful!

1790
01:24:14,601 --> 01:24:16,599
Where is Neeru.

1791
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,600
Shooting nearthe pond.

1792
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:20,599
What?
- Near the pond.

1793
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,599
Bathing scene?

1794
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,580
Oh, God!

1795
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:28,799
Like 'My dear Kuttichathan', 'Njan
Gandharvanfl.

1796
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,666
He is gone, isn't it?

1797
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:32,666
Will we ever see 'Zero' again?

1798
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,666
<i>Iwill</i> miss him.

1799
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:37,233
Why are you crying like a child?

1800
01:24:37,234 --> 01:24:38,399
What are you doing?

1801
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,633
Didn't he leave?

1802
01:24:39,634 --> 01:24:41,633
Why are you crying, my child?

1803
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:43,800
This is field, please move.

1804
01:24:43,801 --> 01:24:45,599
Can't you see the short film shoot is going on?

1805
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,099
No shootwill happen here.

1806
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,500
Grandmother is waiting at Guruvayur.

1807
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:50,166
Why didnfiét you answer the call?

1808
01:24:50,167 --> 01:24:51,233
Come here.

1809
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:51,599
What is it?

1810
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,699
When you called, didn't Itell you that.

1811
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,433
Ifl come, shoot will not happen?

1812
01:24:54,434 --> 01:24:55,366
You don't tell me anything"

1813
01:24:55,367 --> 01:24:56,333
Get into the car.

1814
01:24:56,334 --> 01:24:57,399
Isn't it a matter of one day?

1815
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,633
Grandmother is alone there.

1816
01:24:58,634 --> 01:24:59,499
I need to go.

1817
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,600
What will happen ifl don't come?

1818
01:25:02,601 --> 01:25:04,566
I'm only asking you to come.

1819
01:25:04,567 --> 01:25:07,133
What ifl do not come?

1820
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:08,499
Oh, God!

1821
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,766
Then you, yourself inform grandmother.

1822
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:14,266
I cannot play around in between you both.

1823
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:16,247
What to do if she starts like this?

1824
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,166
What happened to her?

1825
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:17,766
<i>Iwill</i> tell, come here.

1826
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:19,699
We will kill him and put him in the pond.

1827
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,666
She has psychosis and"

1828
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:22,666
All of you come here.

1829
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:23,599
One minute.

1830
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,580
What?

1831
01:25:27,467 --> 01:25:28,533
Have a look.

1832
01:25:28,534 --> 01:25:29,599
What is it, Neeru?

1833
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,266
What is it?

1834
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:34,339
What is the issue? [Reading message]

1835
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:44,000
All of you are here, what is it?

1836
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:45,776
What is the news?

1837
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,233
Have you read this book?

1838
01:25:49,234 --> 01:25:50,566
It's interesting.

1839
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:52,300
The story line is the interaction between..

1840
01:25:52,301 --> 01:25:55,633
<i>A</i> father and his to be born child.

1841
01:25:55,634 --> 01:25:57,614
Tapas will like it.

1842
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,480
What is the meaning ofthis?

1843
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:08,433
It's from your number, we received the
message.

1844
01:26:08,434 --> 01:26:10,733
Did you do this?

1845
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:12,714
Yes.

1846
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:17,733
Have you heard the name 'Mayflower'?

1847
01:26:17,734 --> 01:26:19,733
I know only 'Manjil virinja poovu'.

1848
01:26:19,734 --> 01:26:21,733
What is this Mayflower?

1849
01:26:21,734 --> 01:26:23,714
This was a member in your group.

1850
01:26:24,567 --> 01:26:27,733
It wanted to check whether you all have..

1851
01:26:27,734 --> 01:26:29,733
Any connection, I sent the message.

1852
01:26:29,734 --> 01:26:30,610
Mayflower.

1853
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:38,114
The owner of this ID is no more now.

1854
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:42,972
It's the soul that is creating all issues here.

1855
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,100
Before you came here..

1856
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:49,099
As you didn't know each other"

1857
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:52,266
it is also seeing you only after you reached
here.

1858
01:26:52,267 --> 01:26:55,043
Rather, it was waiting for you all to come.

1859
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,304
It's target is all of you.

1860
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:08,433
Ghost, in the internet, that too in our group!

1861
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:10,433
It's following and attacking us..

1862
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,433
It's horror story never heard before.

1863
01:27:12,434 --> 01:27:14,800
Isn't Tapas's story the same?

1864
01:27:14,801 --> 01:27:17,533
Life can be strangerthan fiction.

1865
01:27:17,534 --> 01:27:21,175
Some stories will lead us..

1866
01:27:21,234 --> 01:27:24,408
To some mystic areas beyond our imagination.

1867
01:27:24,467 --> 01:27:26,633
I don't know how to convince you.

1868
01:27:26,634 --> 01:27:36,487
[Screaming]

1869
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:43,143
It's a ghost!

1870
01:27:58,634 --> 01:28:02,548
God, were there so many steps before?

1871
01:28:08,467 --> 01:28:12,133
Burning?

1872
01:28:12,134 --> 01:28:17,134
Come..run...

1873
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:29,575
Run fast.

1874
01:28:32,467 --> 01:28:37,576
[Frightened]
Ithink there are 3 to 4 ofthem!

1875
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,510
It's coming near..run..

1876
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:58,643
[Frightened]

1877
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:13,166
Hi Meera.

1878
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:14,700
I tracked the details.

1879
01:29:14,701 --> 01:29:18,100
Mayflower used to Iogin from a flat in Thrissur.

1880
01:29:18,101 --> 01:29:20,500
I am sending you the address, OK?

1881
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:22,481
Thank you, Meera.

1882
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:51,433
I will be relieved only if the pooja is over.

1883
01:29:51,434 --> 01:29:53,333
Goddess is angry.

1884
01:29:53,334 --> 01:29:55,666
These are all it's indication.

1885
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:58,099
Nothing like this has happened here before.

1886
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,433
Is it not? No.

1887
01:29:59,434 --> 01:30:00,666
John sir is not to be seen in his room.

1888
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:02,666
Canfiét find in his room?
- No.

1889
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:05,266
Why is it burnt?

1890
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:07,247
Oh Goddess, aren't the trials over?

1891
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,433
10B, are you from the media?

1892
01:30:15,434 --> 01:30:17,066
Why?

1893
01:30:17,067 --> 01:30:19,200
Please don't more create news and"

1894
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:21,199
spoil the flat's reputation further.

1895
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,999
After the bank manager was jailed..

1896
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,499
The flat rentals have come down.

1897
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,999
Do you know that?

1898
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,733
Iam not from the media.

1899
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:32,600
I came here seeing the online
advertisement of the flat for rent.

1900
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:33,633
Is it 10B?

1901
01:30:33,634 --> 01:30:37,366
So, is Deepa madam moving to native place?

1902
01:30:37,367 --> 01:30:39,366
I don't know.

1903
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:42,166
Is there a problem?

1904
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:45,433
Even if I didn't say, you will come to know.

1905
01:30:45,434 --> 01:30:46,799
So, I will say.
- OK.

1906
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,146
Her husband was jailed in a bank fraud case.

1907
01:30:51,234 --> 01:30:54,433
Their only child committed suicide..

1908
01:30:54,434 --> 01:30:56,566
In the same flat 6 months back because of that.

1909
01:30:56,567 --> 01:30:58,566
Oh, No!

1910
01:30:58,567 --> 01:30:59,599
Yes.

1911
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,600
He was a peculiar boy.

1912
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:02,999
He wouldn't talk to anyone.

1913
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,033
He didn't have friends too.

1914
01:31:04,034 --> 01:31:07,600
He wouldn't even step out of the flat.

1915
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:10,066
If it's for rent, there is another flat.

1916
01:31:10,067 --> 01:31:11,099
I can show you that.

1917
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,566
Give me some commission, that's all.

1918
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:14,733
We can think of that.

1919
01:31:14,734 --> 01:31:16,714
Now let me go and see the flat.

1920
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:36,099
From morning, I have not seen anyone outside.

1921
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:36,510
What?

1922
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,139
Don't be afraid. Open the door.

1923
01:31:45,101 --> 01:31:46,239
Who is it?

1924
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,266
Kids, afterthe pooja that is starting tomorrow,

1925
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,700
everything will be solved.

1926
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:05,266
There are 2 days of activities.

1927
01:32:05,267 --> 01:32:06,766
You can do the activities yourself.

1928
01:32:06,767 --> 01:32:09,366
We don't need the Mana,shooting or anything.

1929
01:32:09,367 --> 01:32:11,333
We are all relieved only in the morning.

1930
01:32:11,334 --> 01:32:12,699
John sir is also not to be seen!

1931
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,500
Iam feeling odd.

1932
01:32:13,501 --> 01:32:15,766
Was there any quarrel yesterday?

1933
01:32:15,767 --> 01:32:17,566
So that is the biggest issue for you?

1934
01:32:17,567 --> 01:32:20,599
Don't make me call some other name.

1935
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,566
Move away, 'Mundakkal Shekara'.

1936
01:32:22,567 --> 01:32:23,033
What?

1937
01:32:23,034 --> 01:32:24,766
This the rosary my father gave.

1938
01:32:24,767 --> 01:32:26,371
It's only because of this I
could hold on yesterday.

1939
01:32:28,267 --> 01:32:30,304
Who kept this here to scare people?

1940
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,399
What is the issue, kids?

1941
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,233
What else should happen?

1942
01:32:33,234 --> 01:32:34,269
Why do you get scared like this?

1943
01:32:35,734 --> 01:32:37,299
Did you call for Uber?

1944
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,075
I had called your father twice.

1945
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,100
Where were you?

1946
01:32:49,101 --> 01:32:50,079
You did scare us.

1947
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:54,447
Unniyetta, I went in search of a person.

1948
01:33:02,567 --> 01:33:04,274
Mayflower is Manav Mathew.

1949
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,577
I'm coming from Manav's house.

1950
01:33:12,034 --> 01:33:14,605
The issue won't stop here if you go.

1951
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,335
He has seen you.

1952
01:33:16,734 --> 01:33:18,145
And he will follow you.

1953
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:22,600
Only through you all..

1954
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:25,741
He will be able to find the answerfor his life.

1955
01:33:33,501 --> 01:33:38,575
'Credit card fraud, bank manager arrested.'

1956
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:45,512
'Distressed son commits suicide.'

1957
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,366
Manav's father, Mathew Emmanuel"

1958
01:33:52,367 --> 01:33:55,433
was in the IT department of VTI bank.

1959
01:33:55,434 --> 01:33:59,999
Mathew is in jail for credit card fraud there.

1960
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,503
Only because of his son, Manav Mathew.

1961
01:34:03,667 --> 01:34:06,307
It was the data in Emmanuel's
laptop that was lost.

1962
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,138
Other than Emmanuel"

1963
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:13,705
only Manav was using that laptop.

1964
01:34:20,134 --> 01:34:22,133
After Emmanuel was jailed"

1965
01:34:22,134 --> 01:34:24,114
not once did Manav go to see him.

1966
01:34:24,634 --> 01:34:26,633
He always sat in his room.

1967
01:34:26,634 --> 01:34:28,614
Till the end.

1968
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:33,033
Manav committed suicide due to the
humiliation"

1969
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:37,278
that his father was jailed because of him.

1970
01:34:40,234 --> 01:34:42,633
But what is it's connection with our FB group?

1971
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:45,066
We checked his internet history"

1972
01:34:45,067 --> 01:34:47,066
when a case on film piracy came.

1973
01:34:47,067 --> 01:34:49,445
He was irregular at school too.

1974
01:34:50,301 --> 01:34:54,100
We couldn't pay attention
amidst our work pressure.

1975
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:58,299
Manav started his wrong deeds
by uploading to your FB group..

1976
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:03,300
Videos of new films he shot from theaters.

1977
01:35:03,434 --> 01:35:05,533
He got the appreciation that..

1978
01:35:05,534 --> 01:35:08,733
He never got from school or friends.

1979
01:35:08,734 --> 01:35:11,433
Initially it started off as a joke but.

1980
01:35:11,434 --> 01:35:16,434
Somebody in your group taught
Manav the way to earn money.

1981
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,600
Rather, he used him.

1982
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:23,499
He doesn't know who the person is or what he
does.

1983
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,744
Moreover at his age, he couldn't
recognise the treachery.

He reached a stage where his
father could get into trouble.

1987

Mathew took the blame on him to save his son.

So we did not pursue it.

1991
01:35:52,434 --> 01:35:56,033
Doing that now is of no use too.

1992
01:35:56,034 --> 01:36:00,107
The person who used Manav's
brain to earn crores escaped.

1993
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,238
He wants that criminal.

1994
01:36:04,267 --> 01:36:08,306

2002

2159
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:59,800
[indistinct conversation]

2160
01:52:18,801 --> 01:52:20,781
'Excited!

2161
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,209

Attention please.

2169
01:53:15,234 --> 01:53:18,600
I don't know what you all are
going to see is good or bad"

2170
01:53:18,601 --> 01:53:20,433
Still we have all tried our best.

2171
01:53:20,434 --> 01:53:22,433
We had to make changes in the script.

2172
01:53:22,434 --> 01:53:24,166
Based on our experiences.

2173
01:53:24,167 --> 01:53:25,466
Thank you all for coming.

2174
01:53:25,467 --> 01:53:26,969

2175
01:53:34,034 --> 01:53:40,246
[Applause]

2176
01:53:47,434 --> 01:53:50,666
Isn't it a new birth?

2177
01:53:50,667 --> 01:53:52,666
I will need to take baby steps.

2178
01:53:52,667 --> 01:53:55,499
This will be our life's best interval.

2179
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,500
You wait and see.

2180
01:53:57,501 --> 01:54:00,000

2181
01:54:00,001 --> 01:54:01,981
There is something wrong here.

2182
01:54:03,267 --> 01:54:06,433
Was it you?

2183
01:54:06,434 --> 01:54:07,538
You scared me.

2184
01:54:11,067 --> 01:54:13,066
We are trapped here.

2185
01:54:13,067 --> 01:54:15,066
We need to find a way out ofthis.

2186
01:54:15,067 --> 01:54:16,166
But how?

2187
01:54:16,167 --> 01:54:19,066
Our FB group and short film..

2188
01:54:19,067 --> 01:54:21,047
What is this connection between them?

2189
01:54:22,367 --> 01:54:23,766
It's Mayflower!

2190
01:54:23,767 --> 01:54:26,748
A person in our group is the reason for his
death.

2191
01:54:28,767 --> 01:54:31,077
Joker..he is the villain.

2192
01:54:31,334 --> 01:54:33,300
But, who is he?

2193
01:54:33,301 --> 01:54:35,042
Where is he?

2194
01:54:44,468 --> 01:54:45,733

2203
01:55:04,101 --> 01:55:05,367
Open the door.

2204
01:55:05,368 --> 01:55:08,747
There is no need to panic.

2205
01:55:30,434 --> 01:55:33,040
Myself, John Don Bosco, a mentalist.

I'm the one who posted the offer
on free data in your group.

2208
01:55:44,267 --> 01:55:46,266
That was also part of investigation.

2209
01:55:46,267 --> 01:55:48,266
What investigation?

2210
01:55:48,267 --> 01:55:50,266
<i>Iwill tell.</i>

2211
01:55:50,267 --> 01:55:54,113
The Joker you saw in the film is here itself.

2212
01:55:55,134 --> 01:55:57,114
He is one among you.

2213
01:55:58,268 --> 01:56:00,248
We are here to find him.

2214
01:56:02,134 --> 01:56:04,166

What I need to tell you is..

2219
01:56:12,767 --> 01:56:14,713
Please don't protect a criminal.

2220
01:56:17,034 --> 01:56:22,382
If anyone here knows about the
person Joker, please respond.

2221
01:56:26,767 --> 01:56:28,747
OK, I believe you.

2222
01:56:33,268 --> 01:56:35,266
That gentleman on the right.

2223
01:56:35,267 --> 01:56:37,247
Can you stand up please?

2224
01:56:45,734 --> 01:56:48,100
When I said, Joker is one among you..

2225
01:56:48,101 --> 01:56:50,081
All were looking around.

2226
01:56:51,567 --> 01:56:53,533
Only you were sitting with your head down.

2227
01:56:53,534 --> 01:56:55,533
Why?

2228
01:56:55,534 --> 01:56:58,378
That's because I had headache.

2229
01:56:59,634 --> 01:57:00,374
Oh.

2230
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,206
Please stay.

2231
01:57:06,267 --> 01:57:07,769
Can you please stand up?

2232
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:11,570
Please stand up.

2233
01:57:15,001 --> 01:57:16,412
Can you please stand up?

2234
01:57:17,767 --> 01:57:20,033
Is he high court, to give stay for everyone?

2235
01:57:20,034 --> 01:57:21,400
What's your name?

2236
01:57:21,401 --> 01:57:22,744
Kalidas.

2237
01:57:24,334 --> 01:57:25,142
Hi.

2238
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,639
Was he an LP school teacher"

2239
01:57:29,734 --> 01:57:31,577
making everyone stand up?

2240
01:57:35,367 --> 01:57:37,347
One among these 9 is Joker.

2241
01:57:40,067 --> 01:57:42,066
But till the investigation is over..

2242
01:57:42,067 --> 01:57:43,740
No one can go out.

2243
01:57:47,534 --> 01:57:49,533
Aren't you the Joker?

2244
01:57:49,534 --> 01:57:52,743
No, why don't you understand?

2245
01:57:54,467 --> 01:57:56,467
You can sit.

2246
01:57:56,468 --> 01:57:58,733
Symmetrical body language.

2247
01:57:58,734 --> 01:58:00,300
Yes, I knew it Neeru.

2248
01:58:00,301 --> 01:58:01,299
What is it?

2249
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:03,246
I don't know, look there.

2250
01:58:08,467 --> 01:58:10,447
Thank you, Sir.

2251
01:58:14,567 --> 01:58:15,739
Nice watch.

2252
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:18,633
What is your name?

2253
01:58:18,634 --> 01:58:20,136
Revath i.

2254
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,736
Have you gone to police station?

2255
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:29,074
There was a issue with passport verification.

2256
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,066
Sit.

2257
01:58:32,067 --> 01:58:32,977
Thank you, Sir.

2258
01:58:34,734 --> 01:58:36,179
You stay.

2259
01:58:37,301 --> 01:58:38,666
That's deception.

2260
01:58:38,667 --> 01:58:40,033
Yes, deception.

2261
01:58:40,034 --> 01:58:42,241
I was wondering, why it's not coming.

2262
01:59:01,667 --> 01:59:03,633
You stay.

2263
01:59:03,634 --> 01:59:06,733
Neeru, what is this?

2264
01:59:06,734 --> 01:59:08,270
No idea.

2265
01:59:13,767 --> 01:59:15,747
You also stay.

2266
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:22,236
Look at m e.

2267
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,211
Please stay.

2268
01:59:30,301 --> 01:59:32,300
Eye integration.

2269
01:59:32,301 --> 01:59:33,399
My tension is whether..

2270
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:35,778
We will grow old standing here!

2271
01:59:38,234 --> 01:59:41,113
Can you both smile?

2272
01:59:45,101 --> 01:59:47,081
Keep smiling.

2273
01:59:48,267 --> 01:59:51,373
Is this a smiling competition?

2274
01:59:52,801 --> 01:59:57,750
Are you smiling after killing the boy?

2275
02:00:02,267 --> 02:00:03,541
You sit.

2276
02:00:04,701 --> 02:00:06,078
You stay.

2277
02:00:09,267 --> 02:00:11,266
OK, let's try this.

2278
02:00:11,267 --> 02:00:13,233
Look at m e.

2279
02:00:13,234 --> 02:00:18,013
Can you quickly count the people
with specs in this theater?

2280
02:00:20,467 --> 02:00:23,505
Can you? Please.

2281
02:00:31,034 --> 02:00:33,014
Don't change your focus.

2282
02:00:33,534 --> 02:00:35,172
Keep counting.

2283
02:00:37,467 --> 02:00:39,233
Oh my God!

2284
02:00:39,234 --> 02:00:41,233
Baseline.

2285
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:43,233
You are able to count, is it?

2286
02:00:43,234 --> 02:00:44,633
Yes.

2287
02:00:44,634 --> 02:00:46,433
All of you have mobile phone?

2288
02:00:46,434 --> 02:00:47,538
Yes.

2289
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:49,781
You came here to see Sherlock, isn't it?

2290
02:00:53,001 --> 02:00:53,638
No.

2291
02:01:03,367 --> 02:01:04,500
Is it him?

2292
02:01:04,501 --> 02:01:05,411
No.

2293
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,449
A logically puzzled mind can't
think 2 things at a time.

2294
02:01:11,234 --> 02:01:13,214
He is telling the truth.

2295
02:01:14,034 --> 02:01:15,206
You can sit.

2296
02:01:21,134 --> 02:01:23,114
If my assumption is correct.

2297
02:01:24,034 --> 02:01:26,433
All these four have come to see Sherlock.

2298
02:01:26,434 --> 02:01:27,003
What?

2299
02:01:27,201 --> 02:01:29,181
But how four ofthem?

2300
02:01:48,067 --> 02:01:51,233
It's not any ofthem who messaged me.

2301
02:01:51,234 --> 02:01:52,166
Then who?

2302
02:01:52,167 --> 02:01:54,133
Are you mocking us.

2303
02:01:54,134 --> 02:01:56,133
Silence.

2304
02:01:56,134 --> 02:01:59,166
First he told it is one person
and now four persons.

2305
02:01:59,167 --> 02:02:01,147
Last the commissioner will be the villain.

2306
02:02:04,267 --> 02:02:06,766
We can't hold this crowd for a long time.

2307
02:02:06,767 --> 02:02:11,648
It would be a big problem in social media if we
do not solve this case today.

2308
02:02:16,267 --> 02:02:18,247
Ithink I'm failing here.

2309
02:02:20,801 --> 02:02:22,781
Shall I ask them to open the doors?

2310
02:02:24,334 --> 02:02:26,371
We'll tell that it was a mock drill.

2311
02:02:27,401 --> 02:02:29,400
You may both sit.

2312
02:02:29,401 --> 02:02:31,381
You both too.

2313
02:02:33,567 --> 02:02:35,137
Will you tell something?

2314
02:02:35,567 --> 02:02:37,547
Is this some kind of a joke?

2315
02:02:39,701 --> 02:02:41,681
Open the doors please.

2316
02:02:47,067 --> 02:02:48,068
Wait.

2317
02:02:51,268 --> 02:02:53,043
What did you just say?

2318
02:02:54,234 --> 02:02:56,133
Is this some kind of a joke?

2319
02:02:56,134 --> 02:02:58,114
Else what are all these?

2320
02:03:05,267 --> 02:03:07,033
What's your name?

2321
02:03:07,034 --> 02:03:09,014
Askar.

2322
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,133
Meera.

2323
02:03:15,134 --> 02:03:17,499
I need to check all of their lD's.

2324
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:19,499
Get those lD's.

2325
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:22,174
It won't get over seriously.

2326
02:04:11,234 --> 02:04:12,577
Hi Siri..

2327
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:19,500
Why is he looking at me?

2328
02:04:19,501 --> 02:04:21,481
Are you that Paul Barber'?

2329
02:04:36,634 --> 02:04:39,410
He is online for 24 hours on many days.

2330
02:04:41,467 --> 02:04:43,640
Why is he taking so much time to type?

2331
02:04:51,234 --> 02:04:53,600
Jyothis, Ousepacham.

2332
02:04:53,601 --> 02:04:55,599
Kalidas, Emil

2333
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:57,600
Please stand up.

2334
02:04:57,601 --> 02:04:59,581
Please stand up.

2335
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:12,566
Finally he will tell, it's not them!
Wait and see.

2336
02:05:12,567 --> 02:05:16,174
All four of you are just a joke..

2337
02:05:16,701 --> 02:05:18,681
Without the 'R'.

2338
02:05:35,267 --> 02:05:37,770
Can you please stand up, Mr. Renil.

2339
02:05:56,767 --> 02:05:58,075
Daredevil.

2340
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,766
Blind! How will he watch the film?

2341
02:06:01,767 --> 02:06:03,500
Forthat, inner eye is enough.

2342
02:06:03,501 --> 02:06:05,499
The Mastermind of Joker team!

2343
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:07,500
Original name, Renil.

2344
02:06:07,501 --> 02:06:10,277
ID in this group, 'Daredevil'.

2345
02:06:11,434 --> 02:06:14,233
The only one Avenger that is blind..

2346
02:06:14,234 --> 02:06:16,771
'Daredevil'! Is it not Renil?

2347
02:06:21,634 --> 02:06:23,580
Joker is not one ofthem.

2348
02:06:26,134 --> 02:06:28,114
They are the 'Joker'.

2349
02:06:29,267 --> 02:06:30,439
Jyothish"

2350
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:33,170
Ousepachan..

2351
02:06:34,467 --> 02:06:35,775
Kalidas"

2352
02:06:37,434 --> 02:06:38,378
Emil..

2353
02:06:39,734 --> 02:06:41,372
And Renil.

2354
02:06:43,034 --> 02:06:44,035
JOKER!

2355
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:48,766
J, O, K, E, R.

2356
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:50,133
Wonderful.

2357
02:06:50,134 --> 02:06:51,733
What nonsense is this?

2358
02:06:51,734 --> 02:06:53,699
What evidence do you have?

2359
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:55,700
You are the evidence.

2360
02:06:55,701 --> 02:06:57,700
Cyber crimes are the easiest to prove..

2361
02:06:57,701 --> 02:07:01,239
When a criminal is caught.

2362
02:07:02,001 --> 02:07:05,466
Your bank records, browsing history"

2363
02:07:05,467 --> 02:07:07,766
the transactions you made"

2364
02:07:07,767 --> 02:07:11,766
for all ofthese, you will be answerable.

2365
02:07:11,767 --> 02:07:13,405
Can you?

2366
02:07:15,601 --> 02:07:17,300
Didn't I tell you before..

2367
02:07:17,301 --> 02:07:19,699
Only a menatalist can solve any case properly..

2368
02:07:19,700 --> 02:07:21,133
Police and military are nothing.

2369
02:07:21,134 --> 02:07:23,133
That's my boy.

2370
02:07:23,134 --> 02:07:26,047
I can prove this case right here now.

2371
02:07:29,167 --> 02:07:31,147
Give me your phones.

2372
02:07:33,734 --> 02:07:35,407
Give me.

2373
02:07:35,801 --> 02:07:39,408
OK, it was a mistake.

2374
02:07:40,267 --> 02:07:42,008
We agree.

2375
02:07:43,101 --> 02:07:45,566
We got acquainted through internet"

2376
02:07:45,567 --> 02:07:47,733
We got trapped in making easy money.

2377
02:07:47,734 --> 02:07:50,433
We had severe financial problems.

2378
02:07:50,434 --> 02:07:55,434
These are stories told by all criminals.

2379
02:07:56,234 --> 02:07:59,078
You all are misfit in this world.

2380
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:05,366
Hey, I was made misfit by this world of yours..

2381
02:08:05,367 --> 02:08:09,366
Instead, I made the cyber space my world.

2382
02:08:09,367 --> 02:08:12,233
But, we have not killed anyone.

2383
02:08:12,234 --> 02:08:17,133
What you have done is brutal
than killing a person.

2384
02:08:17,134 --> 02:08:19,546
You have executed his soul.

2385
02:08:25,434 --> 02:08:27,243
And it's going to follow you.

2386
02:08:30,134 --> 02:08:32,341
You deserve no mercy.

2387
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:37,633
Meera..they are all yours.

2388
02:08:37,634 --> 02:08:39,614
Take them.

2389
02:08:53,467 --> 02:08:56,766
We can take immediate action
aftertheir bank records verification.

2390
02:08:56,767 --> 02:09:00,305
After that, release of
Manav's father will be easy.

2391
02:09:02,234 --> 02:09:03,233
Thank you.

2392
02:09:03,234 --> 02:09:03,799
Thank you.

2393
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,400
<i>Iwill</i> call.

2394
02:09:04,401 --> 02:09:05,311
See you.
- Bye.

2395
02:09:08,301 --> 02:09:09,439
Thank you.

2396
02:09:47,434 --> 02:09:52,434
'Joker group meets with a
mysterious death in the lockup'

2397
02:10:01,134 --> 02:10:05,000
Manavs father and mother is coming to meet
you.

2398
02:10:05,001 --> 02:10:08,167
They are waiting for Sifs
Kayakalpa treatment to get over.

2399
02:10:08,168 --> 02:10:10,633
Sir, tomorrow is the award function.

2400
02:10:10,634 --> 02:10:13,733
Our 'lnterval' has bagged 5
awards including best short film.

2401
02:10:13,734 --> 02:10:15,566
Oh, congrats.

2402
02:10:15,567 --> 02:10:18,999
I am the best actor!

2403
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,176
After that, I have stopped acting in films.

2404
02:10:31,001 --> 02:10:35,700
Shall we buy this and make this a resort?

2405
02:10:35,701 --> 02:10:37,266
First pay this cafs loan.

2406
02:10:37,267 --> 02:10:40,339
Who are these 3 blind people?

2407
02:10:41,167 --> 02:10:43,666
You can't park visitor's car here.

2408
02:10:43,667 --> 02:10:45,466
We are not visitors.

2409
02:10:45,467 --> 02:10:47,333
We came to know about Kayakalpa treatment.

2410
02:10:47,334 --> 02:10:47,599
What?

2411
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,333
Is he deaf?

2412
02:10:48,334 --> 02:10:51,666
The thing that gives eternal youth?

2413
02:10:51,667 --> 02:10:53,666
Who from you needs to get eternal youth?

2414
02:10:53,667 --> 02:10:55,066
We all require.

2415
02:10:55,067 --> 02:10:56,633
We can give whatever money you need.

2416
02:10:56,634 --> 02:10:59,133
Is there anyone who has completed
'Kayakalpa' and got eternal youth?

2417
02:10:59,134 --> 02:11:01,266
Yes, one person has completed only yesterday.

2418
02:11:01,267 --> 02:11:01,800
Is it?

2419
02:11:01,801 --> 02:11:03,233
There he comes.

2420
02:11:03,234 --> 02:11:04,766
Oh my God! Perera, escape.

2421
02:11:04,767 --> 02:11:08,767
Oh! John..Don..Bosco!

2422
02:11:08,768 --> 02:11:11,166
Who are these three idiots?

2423
02:11:11,167 --> 02:11:12,400
Is this eternal youth?

2424
02:11:12,401 --> 02:11:14,399
He has become very small!

2425
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:17,399
Do you already know each other?

2426
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:19,400
Not really, isn't it Shibu?

2427
02:11:19,401 --> 02:11:24,366
He always has a group of kids to fool.

2428
02:11:24,367 --> 02:11:25,633
Hey..what a surprise!

2429
02:11:25,634 --> 02:11:26,466
What surprise?

2430
02:11:26,467 --> 02:11:27,766
It is nothing bigger than the floods, right?

2431
02:11:27,767 --> 02:11:30,133
Deny Kokkan looks like a swami now.
Isn't it, Priyan?

2432
02:11:30,134 --> 02:11:32,633
But he behaves like a priest.

2433
02:11:32,634 --> 02:11:33,800
You did not come here to see me.

2434
02:11:33,801 --> 02:11:35,033
We would never come.

2435
02:11:35,034 --> 02:11:37,433
Kayakalpa...eternal youth"

2436
02:11:37,434 --> 02:11:37,733
is it?

2437
02:11:37,734 --> 02:11:41,766
Have you still not learnt to
talk like a normal malayalee?

2438
02:11:41,767 --> 02:11:46,767
Anyway, meet Raman, Neeru, Anu, Tapas and
Joffin.

2439
02:11:47,367 --> 02:11:49,133
Anu?
- Neeru.

2440
02:11:49,134 --> 02:11:49,766
It doesn't matter.

2441
02:11:49,767 --> 02:11:52,066
No..there is another person to hug her.

2442
02:11:52,067 --> 02:11:52,466
Who is this?

2443
02:11:52,467 --> 02:11:53,500
He might be a nuisance.

2444
02:11:53,501 --> 02:11:54,200
Not so much as you.

2445
02:11:54,201 --> 02:11:55,633
Hello.

2446
02:11:55,634 --> 02:11:57,599
There is a person for her too.

2447
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,099
Is this Malayatoor hill?
- No saint Geevarghese.

2448
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:02,433
Then go hit the dragon.

2449
02:12:02,434 --> 02:12:05,033
Priyan has not yet changed.
- We are giving him medicine.

2450
02:12:05,034 --> 02:12:06,233
Why do you need Kayakalpa now?

2451
02:12:06,234 --> 02:12:07,600
You could do with ten push ups daily.

2452
02:12:07,601 --> 02:12:10,299
That doesn't help.

2453
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:13,406
Is that the reason why you
still carry Spanish fly?

2454
02:12:15,234 --> 02:12:16,766
What is this Spanish fly?

2455
02:12:16,767 --> 02:12:21,100
Google it!

2456
02:12:21,101 --> 02:12:22,466
I don't have it.
- Yes, you have.

2457
02:12:22,467 --> 02:12:24,066
No.
- Yes.

2458
02:12:24,067 --> 02:12:26,733
Shall I take it from your pocket?
- I said, I don't have.

2459
02:12:26,734 --> 02:12:32,082
This is a medicine for my grandmother!
