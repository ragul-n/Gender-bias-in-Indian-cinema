00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:33,782
What can be ultimate price for a heart
and for a few minutes..

3
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,213
..when it can give life to a person?

4
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,118
A very big happiness,

5
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,724
A very big happiness, or a big trouble and even
if it is not that, then a combination of both.

6
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,466
lt is that way l too thought.

7
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,906
But then life and its twists are
much bigger than my thoughts.

8
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,803
Under no circumstances
it can be delayed.

9
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:02,538
Or else just a simple look,
and there is an attraction and when it ends..

10
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:08,881
it makes one lie and it takes many forms
and for all these at least sometimes..

11
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:13,855
..twelve hours are enough.
Just twelve hours.

12
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,865
ln the morning you should have at least told
have called her and wished her the best..

13
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,763
..or at least after it was over you could
have at least asked how it went.

14
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,705
Yesterday and the day before it is going on
day and night isn't it? ln that it got left out.

15
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,544
And then it is no use to make it a calamity.
lt is just a stage item, isn't it?

16
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,043
Like that it is notjust
a stage item..

17
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,979
..she is reaching the stage level
for the first time.

18
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,385
Didn't l tell you, how much she
is straining for that?

19
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,122
How much she must have felt about it?

20
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,563
When l was in these hundreds of things
You could have at least reminded me.

21
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,068
You just tell her that l had called.

22
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,298
When she had gone to school
or when she was sleeping..

23
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,170
..tell her that l had called and
asked for details.

24
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,748
Sir.
- Ready, isn't it?

25
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,745
Ready, sir.

26
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,444
lf you d+E1 156on't get me, you just call
this Mathew, okay? Bye.

27
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,445
Did mother note one thing?

28
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,421
How was the competition,
whether she got the prize..

29
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,762
What are your hobbies?

30
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,601
Mainly internet surfing.
Facebook, Twitter..

31
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,277
..then surely some eastern music
and some reading.

32
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,946
Movies?
- Yeah, that too.

33
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,938
Name a Malayalam movie that
you like a lot?

34
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,447
Classmate?
- Why?

35
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,453
l have just completed my studies
and come out.

36
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,714
That is why the mood of college and
friends haven't changed till now.

37
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,219
l guess that is the main reason.
- Why Journalism?

38
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:33,127
lf the news that l report will make
a small change in someone's life,

39
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,561
then l will be happy.
lt is for that.

40
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:44,172
''Sometimes there is
a thought in my mind.''

41
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,807
Thank you.

42
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,513
When l give one song to you, you had
promised to give one to me in return.

43
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,081
Now since the last two days
only l am giving.

44
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:59,418
Not perfect. lf not free, then become free.
Then on Wednesday, 10.30 to 1 on my name.

45
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,319
Don't forget that. Okay?
l will reach home and call you.

46
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,988
Love you too. Bye. Bye.

47
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,163
Gayatri. Gayatri Verma.
- Then the other one? Shilpa?

48
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,496
Which Shilpa?
lt is a case of expiry date over, isn't it?

49
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,398
Now only, Gayatri.

50
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,439
Hey, Suresh, you don't listen to all his
nonsense and create some trouble.

51
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,039
Now who is this person?

52
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,349
The hottest woman, in Cochin.
Saw her, got to know her.

53
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,180
Moved with her for two weeks
and sang a song too.

54
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,722
Last week, l sang again.
This Wednesday l am going to sing again.

55
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,591
lntimately.
- My mother.

56
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,728
This is the first time he took bribe.

57
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,956
Due to his misfortune he got
caught in that only.

58
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,831
Yes. Traffic constable.

59
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,797
Name.. what is your name?
- Sudevan.

60
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,642
Sudevan. Yes. Sir.

61
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:57,638
He is a Nair. Sir should favorably tell the
minister and must take back his suspension.

62
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,584
He is man with 3-4 daughters.
lt is his job, isn't it?

63
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,256
He will have to then jump with
his family in front of a train.

64
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,760
Hello, can you hear now?

65
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:14,490
Yes. l was in the lift. That is why.
Yes, l will come.

66
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,759
Had come to shooting..
- ln the white Ford.

67
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,932
What happened to Rajan's cheque?
- Got cleared.

68
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,437
When told as it has to be
said it got cleared.

69
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,438
Sir, please.

70
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,439
What are the things, Joy?

71
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,612
We have kept our release on the 16th.

72
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,838
The people who have seen it say
the climax is too good.

73
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,106
Then the rest is not good?

74
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,112
Not like that.
- Not that way.

75
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,784
Tomorrow we have kept its preview.

76
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:33,883
lf sir comes..

77
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,620
Hey, l won't. Tomorrow l have
full day shooting.

78
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,521
On the 16th will you be here or..

79
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,394
l can't say anything.
Sometime l may have Malaysia trip.

80
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,291
Stand aside.

81
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,463
lf you too were there for the promotion,
then it would have been much better.

82
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,899
lf you promote it, it is enough.
l don't come for such things.

83
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,001
Then alright.

84
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,813
You first film, isn't it? Kneel and pray.
- Thank you, sir. Okay?

85
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,548
What happened?
- Joining on the 16th. Journalist training.

86
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,656
l knew it, man. l knew it.

87
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,324
Ok, then, l will remove
the bike and come.

88
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,835
ln the court..

89
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:29,338
Over. Divorce allowed. Substitute.

90
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:48,017
Not because l knew Rehan,
they suspect him too.

91
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,861
And then it was a relationship that had
to end from the beginning itself.

92
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:02,706
l am happy for you.
Shall l leave? Take care.

93
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:15,744
Central

94
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,555
Yes, let it go, go there and park.

95
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,727
Now one more hour it will take.

96
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,897
l will reach there by 1 .30-2-2.30.
lsn't it enough?

97
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,897
You are a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

98
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,067
lf people like you start like this,
then it is difficult.

99
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,565
No, sir, since it was a test drive..

100
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,237
So what if it is a test drive?
Shouldn't wear a seat belt?

101
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,268
Sorry, sir.

102
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,842
Okay. Bring it here.

103
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,171
At what time we thought
of coming on this route?

104
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,245
At what time l thought
of buying this car.

105
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,280
Didn't get the color l wanted, now this..

106
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,248
Sir, this is lucky colour.
- Yes, l can see the luck.

107
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,079
Hey, l am telling you one thing.

108
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,588
The coming 16th is the wedding anniversary.
lt is a surprise gift to my wife.

109
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,091
That day in the morning when l come
for delivery if you say this and that,

110
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,592
l won't listen to anything.
Heard it?

111
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,527
''When you are smiling so much..''
- Hey, come on, man.

112
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:05,329
Okay, l will get back to you later.
Okay, bye, bye. Okay

113
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,604
Then go on the 16th after
prayers and join the duty.

114
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,938
l have told everything and made it ok.
- Thank you, sir.

115
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:19,273
But saying 3-4 daughters.
l have only one daughter.

116
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,545
Hey, man, when l tell the difficulties you
must enhance and enlarge it a little.

117
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,349
The minister isn't going to come
to your house and ask.

118
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,286
Then you go.

119
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,293
Henceforth don't do such things.

120
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,207
Let us go.

121
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:55,647
That is law. Who should stand,
who should go to decide that only two colors.

122
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:05,562
At least for a minute we all cross over at
a four road junction, with many expectations.

123
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,996
Then in just a wink to many ways.
To many goals.

124
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,670
Maybe we will again meet
at this same junction again.

125
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:23,276
May be some calculations that we think will
come true may follow. That is the law.

126
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:45,894
Central

127
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:13,764
The way two hearts join.
On the wings of coolness..

128
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:19,633
..on the branches of the laughter.

129
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:32,084
The dreams come looking for shores.
And the wishes and wants that flow

130
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:37,745
The lust flows endlessly
to a long life and many births

131
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:43,918
From all these the feelings
that come up and

132
00:12:44,130 --> 00:13:01,811
The way two hearts join.
On the wings of coolness....

133
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:07,715
on the branches of the laughter

134
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:30,999
Central

135
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:52,726
The wishes get fulfilled.

136
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:59,465
The eyes dance.
And when you dance like a bird.

137
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:29,325
The sweetness found on the cheeks
And lips that we taste together

138
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:35,201
Takes us into clouds of happiness.

139
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:51,079
Central

140
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:10,066
We find a new language to speak
And also to write to convey

141
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:21,578
...the feeling of love and our dreams
And sing them all in happiness.

142
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:40,971
The way two hearts join.
On the wings of coolness..

143
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,840
..on the branches of the laughter.

144
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,949
The sweetness found on
the cheeks

145
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:04,787
And lips that we taste together
Takes us into clouds of happiness.

146
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,803
From one signal 4-5 boys
started following me.

147
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,568
First l didn't mind them.

148
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,646
Then after some time they made a lot of
vulgar comments then l speeded up a little.

149
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,083
They too were adamant.

150
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:30,185
They too started speeding
and rode parallel to the car.

151
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:36,751
To escape them l speeded up jumping
a signal. And l hit some vehicle.

152
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,663
Please.

153
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,169
Why didn't you stop..

154
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,875
ln the shock of hitting the car
l didn't stop.

155
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,175
l did it without knowing.
But l went straight.

156
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,180
l was very scared.

157
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:04,081
Then in the mood in between l..
..know what l and you.

158
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:13,355
Get some onion also from downstairs.
are doing and will say

159
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,193
Dad, mum wants 1/2 kg onion also.

160
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,692
Quarter kg onion.

161
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,369
Daughter said, half kg.
Sir, didn't hear properly.

162
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,037
Heard or not, you give quarter kg.

163
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,039
How much? 36-38, Rs.50.

164
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,877
What else you want?
- Tomatoes.

165
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,383
Where did l stop?

166
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,147
You spoke to Joychhan about my work.
Then..

167
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:43,222
After hearing your history,
he looked surprised.

168
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,561
Time is bad.

169
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,665
A man who is at home
after suspension..

170
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,769
..does it need an astrologer
to say that his time is bad?

171
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,528
lf so, then l also can do
this job, can't l?

172
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,896
The man is notjust some
ordinary astrologer.

173
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,904
He works in the Central Government.

174
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:02,069
l heard that you brought some medicines
saying your health is not good.

175
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,343
Sudevan, is going to join today, isn't he?

176
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,249
l came to know that you got hold
of the minister via Rajendran.

177
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,018
l thought that you must have taken
at least Rs. 50,000 bribe.

178
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,591
Only when, Rajendran told me you went
through so much just for Rs. 15,000?

179
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,328
Next time, let it come.
l will take 100,000.

180
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,027
But from the association's side
you must give me a welcome.

181
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,103
Now that fellow who just spoke to me take
his horoscope and give it to that astrologer..

182
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,508
if he calculates and says that someone
will beat him and kill him,

183
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,444
then l will believe him.
- Okay.

184
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,852
Wait. Wait. l am going to the office today.
l will take you to the school.

185
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,785
No, dad. l will walk. Saumya and
Meera are there, aren't they?

186
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:56,324
Central

187
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,969
These Saumya and
Meera were before also.

188
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,638
Then before them she was very
proud to go on dad's bike with dad.

189
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,139
Since last 2-3 weeks she goes to
school in their company, isn't it?

190
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,474
She must have got used to it.

191
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,852
And then dad's snap and name came in the
papers not for getting gold medal, isn't it?

192
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,147
Even at the age of sixteen
that labour can be seen.

193
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,057
Yes. Yes. Today is the release
of the film. Thank you.

194
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,035
Oh! l will call you.

195
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,000
Any call from Palakkad?
Sister had called.

196
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,837
She said that daughter slept well.

197
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,713
But when l talked to the doctor
he said that it did not matter.

198
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,018
At any time it may like before.
l think it is over.

199
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,192
10.45 lndian Airlines ticket
has been confirmed.

200
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,023
Thambi will come to the airport.
From there flight to Palakkad, at 1 1 .45.

201
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,698
Sasi and l will come by road.

202
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,858
No. Let Sasi come by car.
You come with me.- Okay.

203
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,531
Did Sudhi call?

204
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:12,301
Yes, called. Nothing special.
But the channel interview is at 1 1 .

205
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,637
That too live.

206
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,410
Didn't l tell you to make it a bit early?

207
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,545
Yes, since the announcement
was done early..

208
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,879
..now when on my way to airport
l will get down there.

209
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,421
lf they can do that at that time then let them.
Call them and inform that now. Understood?

210
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,224
After going there if they say
delay or some such thing..

211
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,421
Then tell them l will just leave.
- Okay.

212
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,902
Sir, we have changed the step.
Will you see that?

213
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,902
What are you guys doing?
Making fun of people?

214
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,075
You said you will leave me
at 8.30 now it is nine.

215
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,238
l can't take more than this.

216
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,142
There is just one shot. Please, sir.
- When l say l can't means l can't.

217
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,978
Mathew, get the car.

218
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,585
Mathew..
- Wait, let me see.

219
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,995
The one who is with us in Talking Point
is a very special guest.

220
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,762
As Mahadevan, lnspector Kiran,
Rama Murthy and as Dr. Mahendran,

221
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,338
the one who attracted all our hearts in
Malayalam films, the super Megastar Siddharth.

222
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,338
There is lot to talk, lot to know.

223
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,010
Welcome to the slow..

224
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,605
Oh damn! Show. Show. Show.
Why this slow becomes, show all the time?

225
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,352
lt is not slow but show.

226
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,549
The problem is because you are
becoming more conscious.

227
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,726
lf you think you will do mistake now
anyone will make mistakes.

228
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,451
lf it is a small mistake, then without
minding that you should go ahead.

229
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,962
But this is not a small mistake, is it?
lt is my first day.

230
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,031
ln the programme it is not
a mistake at all.

231
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,466
lt is just.. go through like that in the flow.
And then you shouldn't do any rehearsal at all.

232
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,900
Then you won't make mistakes.

233
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,972
Yes. No. l am at home.
What? That means? Oh God!

234
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,307
l am coming now.
- What is it?

235
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,076
The programme is starting. At 9.45.
lt seems he will reach the channel then.

236
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,752
Who?
- That, Siddharth.

237
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,647
You must drop me.
- Yes.

238
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,480
Why so suddenly?

239
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:10,321
Who knows? These people are like that.
l haven't even prepared well.

240
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,225
Tell dad and go, Rehan.

241
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,339
Dad, they have made the
programme a little early.

242
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:26,007
l am straight away going there.
- Yes, l will see that and call you.

243
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,110
You are performing well. l heard so.

244
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,625
Don't hurry.
- Shall we go?

245
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,795
All the best.
You said 9.45, didn't you?

246
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,755
Pray that the show doesn't become slow.

247
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:51,026
lt won't happen like that.
- Okay, aunt.

248
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,865
Okay, son. Bye.
- Bye.

249
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,439
lf you hadn't pushed him he would have
gone without telling me, wouldn't he?

250
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,275
He is a bit angry.
- That doesn't matter, it will change.

251
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,543
l don't think he is mistaken
in any way.

252
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,215
He has all the qualities of
his father, doesn't he?

253
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,148
And he has the qualification
also, doesn't he?

254
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,382
lf only you had called and put a word.

255
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:19,724
He would have got the job. But it will always
be a job that his father got for him.

256
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,900
Though he took some trouble,
he got this by himself, didn't he?

257
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,160
That is good.
That he will understand.

258
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,668
l won't understand your philosophy.

259
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,464
Get me tea.

260
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:41,913

Today we have the biggest star
of the Malayalam industry.

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,787
When you hear that you must

Look, let us all be hopeful.

299
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,481
lf it is haematoma then if we evacuate,
then it is enough..

00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,381
Then the recovery will be smooth.

301

That boy his father is
your friend, isn't he?

00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,301
Can't say he is my friend. Know him
as l have seen him at the club.

328
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,165
Come on, doctor,
what are you getting at?

329
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,105
lsn't he a doctor?
- Yes, surgeon.

330
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,036
Then he will know his boy
won't survive, right?

331
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,616
lf you talk to him..
- What?

332
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,778
lf he agrees for the heart transplant then
we can start the surgery for that immediately.

333
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,624
But the boy is still on ventilator.
- How many hours at the maximum, doctor?

334
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,527
Just fooling the people saying miracle etc
we can't fool our own selves, right?

335
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,861
lf we have to do it,
we have to do it immediately.

336
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:41,027
That girl's BP is going lower and lower.
Also having breathing difficulty.

337
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,996
Now the time is eleven.

338
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,300
We have reached the heart there
and do the transplant.

339
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,805
After that that girl won't survive.

340
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,144
The one who will be saved
is 13 year old girl.

341
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,484
lnstead of doing that waiting for a person to
die whom we know will surely die is not right.

342
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,991
lt is a crime. lt is very negative.

343
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:11,826
Thank you.

344
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,075
l don't understand why we are
hiding like this?

345
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,838
Don't you feel like seeing?

346
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,273
One day or the other,
it is a matter that everyone will know.

347
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,852
lf anyone asks l will tell them.

348
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:35,019
Don't need to see. You don't have any
need to hide any detail of anything.

349
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:39,128
That is enough. My son will die.

350
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,195
lsn't that what you are try
to make me understand?

351
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,427
l understand that.

352
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,196
But for the sake of someone else
sending him off earlier than..

353
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:17,124
Central

354
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,112
Hello. Hello. Where?

355
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:40,150
Okay. l am starting now.
Ask Hari to come with the camera.

356
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,519
The first time l see,
Priya is only a month before.

357
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,425
When working in Asianet,
as a programme producer.

358
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,432
The day on which l went to do an
interview on Siddharth Shankar.

359
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,629
One second.

360
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,771
Sasi, here.

361
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,809
Okay? ls the light etc, okay?
- Okay.

362
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:04,704
Steady.

363
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,284
Here.

364
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,727
Onam is a very special day for me.

365
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:25,634
l always try to come home and have meals
with my family on the Thiruvonam day.

366
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,872
Many times l am not able to do so.

367
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,474
But when l am at home, my daughter and
l together arrange the flower decoration.

368
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,908
Though l don't know much cooking l also
help in doing the cooking of the feast.

369
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,311
The Rasam that l make is like Sambhar,
my daughter says.

370
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,654
Normally they say famous people don't
pay attention to the affairs of home.

371
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,415
ls that also the case with you, sir?

372
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:52,995
No. l share everything with them.
And they tell me about everything also.

373
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,832
At home l am not a star.
l am a husband and a father.

374
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,607
Camera cut.
- Sasi.

375
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,510
Will you ask?

376
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,350
Okay. Camera roll.

377
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,520
Shall l ask just for a joke?

378
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,262
Since you say you know
everything l am asking.

379
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:30,064
Can you say who is the best friend
of your daughter if l ask?

380
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,198
l can. lt is me.

381
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,029
Who is your daughter's
favourite teacher?

382
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,875
Camera cut.

383
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,904
Priya, who is your favorite teacher?

384
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,212
Elizabeth, ma'am.

385
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,107
Camera roll.
- Rolling, sir.

386
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,880
That is, Elizabeth madam.

387
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,947
When she comes from school
she always talks about her.

388
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,721
She is a brilliant teacher.

389
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,726
Not only in teaching, but also in
overall development of her students.

390
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,326
ln the note of question,
there is a sensational news item.

391
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,164
But then, somehow l could not bring
myself to make that girl a scope material.

392
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,500
Today she is before me again.

393
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,406
As a Breaking News which
a journalist cannot avoid.

394
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:25,648
As a dying patient lying in a Hospital
and facing death she is before me.

395
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:57,344
Central

396
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,538
That boy has not died,
but his condition is very bad.

397
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,571
Death can occur at any time.

398
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,901
When the heart is to be taken out
he has to be alive.

399
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:27,250
Once death occurs we cannot do anything.
Not only that, let me be frank.

400
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:33,252
Priya's condition is not at all good.
BP and heart rhythm is abnormal..

401
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,893
..we can at most wait for another,
3 1/2 - 4 hours.

402
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:41,326
By then the new heart should
start working in Priya.

403
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:48,571
The problem is that boy's
parents haven't agreed.

404
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,076
Did you tell him that it is my daughter?

405
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,957
Mathew, call the CM's office urgently.

406
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,357
Sir.- He is trying.
But since he is in Delhi..

407
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,199
No, if sir goes and personally talks
to the boy's parents..

408
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,026
Just a minute. l will call now.

409
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,195
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

410
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,534
Sir, his flights were in the
morning 7.30 and 10.15.

411
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,200
And next flight is at night 9.20 ofjet air.
Only that is there.

412
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,210
See the availability of the helicopters.
Please, fast. - Okay.

413
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,713
Only after we got green signal
l went forward.

414
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,216
Then l don't know what happened.

415
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,720
Sister.

416
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,722
The doctor has specially told that
we can only allow the parents.

417
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,886
Sister, just two minutes. Don't want that
much also. l just want to see.

418
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,996
But we can allow only
one person inside.

419
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,500
You go.

420
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:22,929
Aditi, one person can go in. Go.

421
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:28,930
Go.

422
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,170
Mariana, just come here.

423
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:42,340
What?

424
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,777
Rate falling. l will check BP.

425
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,123
Call the doctor.

426
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,734
Start the lV.
- Yes sir.

427
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,254
lt is a seizure.
We are trying our best.

428
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:07,156
But..
- Doctor, please. You know how it is.

429
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:22,730
Hello, sir. l am James Joseph.
- M.P.

430
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,438
l am sorry, l don't know what to say.

431
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:32,677
What l am going to say, l don't know whether
it can be said in the situation you are in.

432
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:40,747
l had a call from Ahalya Hospital, Palakkad.
Mr. Siddharth Shankar.

433
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,750
Excuse me, sir. District collector.
He wants to talk to you.

434
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,092
Hello.

435
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:59,540
Look, Collector, for you and all others
my son is someone who is going to die.

436
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:05,811
But for me even now he is
my son who is still alive.

437
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:10,275
Please try to understand.
And leave me alone.

438
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:29,568
Yes, sir. l understand.
Thank you for everything.

439
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,986
l want to talk to my mother.

440
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,697
The one who is with us in Talking Point
is a very special guest.

441
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,199
As Mahadevan, lnspector Kiran,
Rama Murthy and as Dr. Mahendran,

442
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,602
the one who won all our hearts in Malayalam
films, the super Megastar Siddharth.

443
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,266
There is a lot to talk, lot to know.
Welcome to the slow..

444
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,443
Oh darn! Show. Show. Show.

445
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:15,608
Why this slow becomes, show all the time?
lt is not slow, but show.

446
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:42,144
lt was his big dream.
He wanted to be a good journalist.

447
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:47,314
A greatjournalist who will be
remembered for a long time.

448
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:57,426
And then a car who carelessly cut the signal
and came and hit us you can say.

449
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:03,759
But if l had taken a little
more care maybe..

450
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,602
An accident caused the
destruction of his dream, right?

451
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,734
We have to instead give him
something more than that.

452
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:19,609
A great human being who will be
remembered for a long time.

453
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,179
Rajeev should tell him
and make him agree.

454
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,853
We have to get his heart transplanted.

455
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,101
Good news. Reehan's parents have agreed.

456
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,708
How are the travel arrangements?
Flight or chopper?

457
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,045
There is no flight from Cochin.

458
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,150
lf you want to charter they say
they want minimum four hours.

459
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,718
Since there is a weather problem
helicopter is not available.

460
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,154
We cannot wait that much.
What is the next option?

461
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:08,222
There is only one option. By road.

462
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,898
Sir, Mathews is waiting.
He is asking when we are starting.

463
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,730
From Kochin to Palakkad
in two hours. Rubbish!

464
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,405
There should be some sense
in what they say.

465
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,736
lf you had told l would have come there.
- Tell me, Nasser, what next?

466
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,070
lt is impossible, sir.

467
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,813
No way. lt should be made
possible by hook or crook.

468
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:29,247
lt is 180km, which means
we have to move at 100kmph.

469
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,078
Highway is okay.

470
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,745
But in major districts there
are many small towns.

471
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,154
ln such places we can't go
beyond 60kmph.

472
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:38,692
Moreover it is a working day.

473
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,592
lf there is a traffic block for five minutes
all planning will go awry.

474
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,927
All these we know. That is why we
can't take by hospital ambulances.

475
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,262
We need an expert driver.
And quick control also is needed.

476
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,098
The police machinery has
to directly be involved.

477
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,536
ln the neighboring Chennai,
in a very similar event..

478
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,107
..the police department took over
and has done it.

479
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,607
They have done it very successfully.

480
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,440
Yes, l know that. But they got
a lot of time for planning.

481
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,446
And then road in Chennai and
Kerala road are not the same.

482
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,777
Why don't you make a try, Nasser?

483
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,452
When we fail, why not it be after trying?

484
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,450
l don't mind, sir.

485
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,284
But wherever we travel it will
be office hours.

486
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,120
Roads will be crowded and there
will be children going after school.

487
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,125
lf you give us orders, we will move.

488
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,057
But it will be sir's responsibility.

489
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,026
l can't take the responsibility
of such a risky mission.

490
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,233
lt is for a life, l agree.

491
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,964
But the same importance is for
the people in that van..

492
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,140
..and the people on the roads.
Just drop it, sir..

493
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,676
..it is too dangerous a game.

494
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,644
Once we cross Palakkad then no problem.
The rest we will take care.

495
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,080
We can block all the main roads
leading to the hospital.

496
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,377
Till then it has to be brought.

497
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,054
The commissioner there
is very adamant.

498
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,586
But we don't have time to lose.

499
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,655
Sir, some pressure from
the ministry level?

500
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,384
We are trying everything.
But the collector is not taking a stand.

501
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:45,994
That is the problem now.

502
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,661
That commissioner has scared
that man so much.

503
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,604
What is this commissioner's name?
- Ajmal Nasser.

504
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,837
Call and offer something.
- l did that also.

505
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,340
Let him quote the amount. Tell him we
will reach it to him in just ten minutes.

506
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,512
l have tried all that.
There is no use.

507
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,011
You call up your Cochin guys right now.

508
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,014
Right now. And tell them that
l will go to the media.

509
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,347
Now whoever is Ajmal Nasser is,
l don't care.

510
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,016
l will see to it that he will..

511
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,124
Sir, please.
- Dear, please. Please.

512
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,190
He doesn't know me.

513
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:22,923
Siddu, this is not the time to get angry.
You just try all ways.

514
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,760
lf you want we could have
taken up the whole process.

515
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,597
But we don't have the time
for that, do we?

516
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,103
The doctors there too once
they get a yes, immediately..

517
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,970
Yes.
- l am calling from Simon's office.

518
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,309
He wants to speak to you.
Ok. Dr. Simon D'souza.

519
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,888
Good afternoon, sir, this is Thomas.

520
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,217
What happened?
Are you all ready?

521
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,950
A small problem, sir.

522
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,561
The commissioner from there says
it is not possible to get it by road.

523
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,325
The heart will reach you.
And it will reach you by road.

524
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:02,070
You start your preparations.
lt is me who is saying Thomas. Trust me.

525
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,078
Yes, doctor, what can l do for you?

526
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:15,246
Write a resignation letter, keep it on
the table and do something else and live.

527
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,010
That is what you can do for me.

528
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,079
ls this a joke?
- Yes, it is a big joke.

529
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,358
Donor is ready, recipient is waiting.

530
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,766
Just if a green signal is received..
the doctors are ready to start the surgery.

531
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:35,432
But the people responsible are hiding with
frozen hands. What is funnier than this?

532
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,440
75 vehicles moving every minute, 3 mega
cities lnnumerable lanes, one way routes..

533
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:44,271
..less than 50 traffic signals about
40 police personnel..

534
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:49,009
..from 3.30 more than 100 school's
students walking pedestrians.

535
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:54,718
Doctor, before over reacting like this
you must think about such details..

536
00:49:55,692 --> 00:50:00,823
Without knowing to which medicine
the patient will react, a quick surgery,

537
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:08,368
a possible venal thrombosis
damage to kidneys, lever or any other organ..

538
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:13,239
..from anti-rejection medication
heart attack that can happen at any time..

539
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,809
..heart rhythm problem,
or else failure.

540
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,779
lf you want to fight to say about technical
risk fight should be taken on equal level.

541
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,419
Obstacles will be there, commissioner..

542
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:28,157
..the police force is there to overcome
that and move forward.

543
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:35,629
We don't need you if it was a just road
which can be crossed like a fantasy.

544
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:40,600
This hospital has many good
and expert ambulance drivers.

545
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:45,241
Look, doctor, l don't have the responsibility
to answer you or convince you.

546
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,500
Don't try also.

547
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,845
When you go for escort for a minister
for a swearing in ceremony..

548
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,515
..there is no risk, obstacles,
and all the calculations..

549
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,583
..which you said before
are not there at all.

550
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,117
don't want to hear your answer that
you may give now which is ready with you.

551
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,017
Look, there is some limit.

552
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,021
l too don't have time to argue.

553
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,127
Before you make a decision
remember something.

554
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,794
lf you say no nothing will happen here.

555
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:14,299
Like all the days this day also
will pass by and will be forgotten.

556
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:20,304
But one yes from you may
sometimes become history.

557
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,379
A history that will give courage to say
yes to many who will come after you.

558
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:38,284
Central

559
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,227
Emergency meeting, twenty minutes.

560
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,063
Minister's pilot and police escorts,
every one of them.

561
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,104
We are starting the mission,
on my responsibility.

562
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,905
180 km, 2 hours.

563
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:02,277
Starting point Lakeshore hospital Ernakulam,
destination, Palakkad Ahalya Hospital.

564
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,248
There will be no halt.
You won't get even one second to relax.

565
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,924
lt is going to be a very dangerous
journey through out.

566
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:13,925
lt is 10, 20 or 30 times more dangerous
than going as a pilot for a minister.

567
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,929
We have given information to
all the district's police force.

568
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,763
ln every point traffic control
arrangement will be done.

569
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:22,936
lf any one of you..

570
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,270
lf any one of you is ready we will be
starting this mission within half an hour.

571
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,436
Sir, just two hours up isn't it a very risky
job, is it? ln such a short notice,

572
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,275
how much traffic control is possible, sir?

573
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,612
When seeing what sir says only blocking
other vehicles will not be a solution.

574
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,618
Since it is a busy time
if you block like that,

575
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,986
then there are possibilities
of having more serious problems also.

576
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,960
When so many commotions are there not only
our vehicle is there on an emergency.

577
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,131
Not only that people who are not
used to traffic regulations..

578
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,391
and no time to make them understand.

579
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,036
Leave that, Balu all that
responsibility is mine.

580
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:57,365
Whoever takes up this mission he
will have to believe in me completely.

581
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:58,632
At every stage of the journey,

582
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,640
but there is no time for argument.

583
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,075
lf you say no nothing will happen here.

584
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,806
Like all the days this day also will pass by.
And will be forgotten.

585
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,645
But one yes from you may
sometimes become history.

586
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,311
A history that will give courage to say
yes to many who will come after you.

587
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,663
Yes, l need one of you to say yes.

588
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:37,240
lf Ramakrishnan was there,
then l wouldn't have troubled you

589
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,682
Even after getting an admission
to such a good course,

590
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:45,844
if you say you can'tjoin it
she will be very much upset, dear.

591
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:14,979
l will leave you at the school.

592
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,245
No, dad, l will walk. Saumya and
Meera are there, aren't they?

593
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,059
Get ready for the surgery and be
at the Operation Theatre in 10 minutes.

594
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,237
Tell all the nurses to be at hand.
- Ok, doctor.

595
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,997
Some are on leave l know,
but please get them.

596
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:58,484
Central

597
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:34,288
Slowly. For a drive.
Come, let us go for a drive, come.

598
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:08,989
Sudevan, the van is ready.
From here first you will go Lakeshore hospital.

599
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,828
The surgery will start in 10 minutes.

600
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,096
After that all the arrangement
the hospital staff will do.

601
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,672
So by the time you get there
everything will be ready.

602
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:25,174
lf you can start from here at two
then you must reach Palakkad by four.

603
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,010
You will get my messages.

604
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,954
Sudevan, this is the route map.

605
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,685
Straight roads and highways,
go at maximum speed.

606
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:40,693
ln cities and towns and junctions
you shouldn't go less than 70 kmph.

607
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,700
The first 25 km is very crucial
in straight road.

608
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,028
To control all the other vehicles
a force has gone ahead.

609
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,432
That 25 km you must cover
in 12 minutes.

610
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,099
After that two crowded junctions.

611
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:57,040
When you slowdown over there you
have to balance what you gained before,

612
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:02,048
which means the first 25kms you will have
to go at a speed of 125 kmph.

613
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,880
ln this journey there will
be two people with you.

614
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,716
One is cardiac surgeon
Dr. Vinoy Joseph.

615
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:10,049
Sorry, doctor, l can't go.

616
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,218
l had said okay thinking it will be a helicopter.
But this is too much risk.

617
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,898
Please leave me out of it.

618
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,001
And then, Rajeev. Reehan's friend.

619
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,942
Surgery is over, Reehan's death occurred.

620
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:38,304
There is a small change. lnstead of
Dr.Vinoy Joseph, Dr. Abel Therian will come.

621
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,576
We wish the mission a success.

622
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,664
Hello!
- My phone will be switched off for a while.

623
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,674
l have an emergency duty.

624
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:07,570
ln Cochin?

625
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,506
No, l will have to go up to, Palakkad.

626
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,680
Escort?
- No

627
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,079
What?

628
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,513
A duty which l don't know whether
l will be able to complete.

629
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:21,521
My name as a bribe taking
constable at some place.

630
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,022
lt is a duty which l went
forward and took.

631
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,558
Shall l go? l will come back by evening.

632
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:39,874
Rajeev. Abel. Sudevan.

633
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,234
Noted traffic constable Sudevan
has taken up the job.

634
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:16,572
He who usually drives the pilot vehicle for the
ministers came forward and took up the duty.

635
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,782
Good going, Sudevan you are
doing absolutely fine.

636
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,113
What is the speed?
- lt is about 120 kms.

637
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,050
Fine.

638
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,645
Okay, 22 kms covered, sir.

639
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,410
Good, that means two minutes
before the time we expected.

640
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,144
Keep going you are doing great.

641
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,320
lt is that van, isn't it?

642
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,556
Passing, sir.

643
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,902
Yes. Mathews.

644
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:53,506
Ok. Thank you. Keep me posted, sir.

645
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,240
So far so good. 25 kms have passed.

646
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,116
This is the dress that the patient
was wearing.

647
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,209
The van crossed, it will reach
within two minutes.

648
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,037
Okay. We are all set here.

649
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,555
ln just two minutes the van
will pass from here.

650
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:45,058
Though it is a little trouble
all of a sudden for the people..

651
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,161
Basha.
- They haven't reached there.

652
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,593
The road is clear.
- Okay good.

653
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,166
Sudevan, the road is clear.
Keep the same speed.

654
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,775
Sudevan...

655
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,508
What is this,
connection got cut?

656
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,415
lt is not possible, sir.
- Please check it.

657
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,347
Get the RTO there.

658
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:17,584
We are waiting sir.

659
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,261
He hasn't come there?
- No, sir.

660
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,826
Hey, what is happening?
- No response, sir.

661
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:35,208
The number you are calling is switched off.
Please call after some time.

662
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,674
How much time we have to wait?

663
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:46,114
Let us go. Come on, this is working time.
We are waiting for long.

664
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:52,784
You must leave us
You must leave us

665
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,622
Stand aside. Stand aside.

666
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:01,999
No trace of them. lt is quite a while
that they should have passed by.

667
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,967
l doubt if there was any accident.
Shall we take the jeep and go, sir?

668
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:09,133
Okay, if you see him moving,
then don't ask him to stop. Okay?

669
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,478
No. - There is no need for him to
deviate in this straight road.

670
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,580
No luck, sir.
The van is missing.

671
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,917
What?
- The van is missing.

672
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,892
The van is missing somewhere
on the way.

673
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:34,830
This was just disclosed by the police
and they are shocked.

674
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:40,498
They are thinking how to
tackle this unexpected issue.

675
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,366
Didn't go today?
- Taken half day leave.

676
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,874
Sister?
- Sister has just left.

677
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,147
Where to this trip is?

678
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,646
Mumbai, a studio conference.
- Okay.

679
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:28,989
My friend, Reehan. Okay. Tony, Maria.
- Fifth floor office. - Hello.

680
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,087
Studying?
- No, in lndia Vision. - Oh!

681
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:36,156
Actually today is his first day.
- Oh, all the best.

682
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:37,229
Thank you.

683
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,398
Okay.
- See you. - Bye.

684
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,572
Thanks.
- Already late.

685
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,250
l have seen this boy somewhere before.

686
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,816
Did sister tell you?

687
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,249
That day when l saw l did not feel so.

688
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,417
But today l have a small doubt.
- ls it? - Yes.

689
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,666
Then all the best.
- Okay.

690
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,595
Seeing him he looks alright

691
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,770
Bye.
- Bye.

692
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:40,623
Okay? Okay, l will meet you
in the afternoon. Yeah.

693
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,124
Catch you.

694
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,394
Maybe the conference may
be postponed by a day.

695
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:49,696
That is always the case, isn't it?
- They had called from south branch.

696
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:53,636
They say that we only should
do the presentation.

697
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,804
Will it be done?
- What is this?

698
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,975
The opposition says the minister
is directly helping the goons.

699
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,147
The minister says that isn't true.

700
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:06,152
The goons are doing theirjobs
without any worry.

701
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,413
l don't believe this.

702
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,990
What is this, didn't l tell you that..

703
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,165
we shouldn't give political statements
at least thousand times?

704
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:21,166
No, Maria, since this goons' issue
has become serious problem,

705
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,497
at least we should give
healthy criticism..

706
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,675
l don't want such a healthy criticism.
That the journalists will do.

707
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,173
We are only for entertainment.

708
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:31,505
Just entertainment.
We don't want any smart talks.

709
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,682
Go and tell them now.

710
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,510
ln the last meeting l had clearly told them.

711
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,016
ln that he didn't say of any problems.

712
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,518
No. But you will see l will get
a phone from above.

713
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,356
Take it back. Quickly. What is it?
- One car hit a bike and went away.

714
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:47,620
Go back or you will get stuck.

715
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,025
When l saw the way those boys like that
l had thought something is going to happen.

716
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:54,532
Hey, we may miss flight.
- We will go by that other route.

717
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,894
At present the correct time
is 2 hr 25 min and 56 seconds.

718
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:44,309
Central

719
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,432
Pick. Pick. Pick. Pick.

720
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,770
Madam, the report of a person.

721
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,312
Shaji has asked you to go through
and give your feedback.

722
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:14,813
Nice shirt, ma'am.
- Thanks.

723
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:15,949
Cool.

724
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,308
Alex. Alex. Can you hear me?

725
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,172
Yes, sir.
- Okay

726
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,473
Our men should go to all lanes
and side roads..

727
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,650
Don't leave any vehicle which you
suspect without checking.

728
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,374
No luck, sir.

729
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,314
Wireless in the van has problem.

730
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,317
But while starting the vehicle all
communications were in good condition.

731
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:58,255
Either a severe shake like an accident or
purposely they must have cut the connection.

732
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,893
Or else there is no chance
for any sort of problem.

733
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,996
Sir, now the problem is our mission
is very much behind.

734
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,496
lt is already 2 hr 40 min.

735
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,635
As every minute is passing by it is
getting more and more impossible.

736
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,326
We will have to just forget it.

737
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,233
And now if he sees the van to
continue the mission means..

738
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,202
He is right, sir.

739
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:15,275
Even if we find the van, it is sure that
our mission will fail that is sure.

740
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:19,641
Failure, means defeated.
Retreat l am going to do that.

741
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,713
Sir, got message from the
mobile companies.

742
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,578
All the three numbers of the van
are switched off now.

743
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,811
So they are not able to trace the location.

744
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,716
But in-between one of those
numbers became on.

745
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,390
lt sent two messages to other mobiles.

746
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:30,923
We have got the number that
received the messages.

747
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,390
The first one was in Kadavandara tower
and then it reached the Vayakkad tower..

748
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:34,995
And now it has just entered
Edappalli tower..

749
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,596
That means that number is
also travelling.

750
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,891
Get me both the numbers
and details.

751
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,931
The number that was switched on in-between
and the number that received the message.

752
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,261
Sir, got here.

753
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,869
Where?
- Here.

01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,143
No, sir. l am outside.

756
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,938
At Edappalli, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

757
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,445
Okay, good, note one number.
- Sir.

758
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:59,376
Hello, if you are travelling,
please stop the vehicle.

759
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,886
Hello, hello, can you hear me?

760
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,048
Where are you now?

761
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,625
ln which traffic signal?

762
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,562
ln which direction is your vehicle?

763
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,730
l am here only. And don't try to move.

764
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,567
What make of car?
You must get down from the car.

765
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,237
l am behind you, sir.

766
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:28,305
Your mobile please.

767
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:33,921
Who sent you this message?

768
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,586
My brother.

769
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,287
Please, Gayatri, we must meet a little early.

770
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:43,761
When you say all we get
is just one or two hours.

771
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,329
There is not enough time for even starters.

772
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,766
You have to give me at least five course.

773
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,765
Or else, one thing.

774
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,776
Just a second.

775
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:58,508
l will go, see and come.

776
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:06,118
Take him to the hospital.

777
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,284
Move aside. Leave way.

778
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,141
Hello.
- What happened?

779
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,303

He has just gone outside.

780
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,639
Shall l ask him to call you back?

781
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:35,542
Hello.

01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,063

Who at this time of the night?
- No one.

784
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:37,875
No one l said.

785
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,277
The hottest woman in cochin.
Saw and got to know her.

786
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,778
Gayatri, l am with one friend.

787
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:49,515
Didn't l tell you, Dr. Abel?
Yes, at east meet tomorrow.

01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:52,888
Now the will you give me

789
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:55,920
Hey, it doesn't matter even if he listens.

790
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,063
He is our man.

791
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:17,151
Hey, Abel!

792
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:24,709
Central

793
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,381
Patient named Reehan's heart
is to be operated.

794
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,647
Yes, doctor.
- We are going in for the heart transplant.

795
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:35,720
Get ready for the surgery.

796
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,892
And be at the operation theatre
in ten minutes.

797
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,891
Dr. Shreedhar, move patient
to the theatre now.

798
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,724
l know that you are on leave today.
But please do come.

799
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,626
Abel, surgery is over five minutes before.

800
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,024
The condition of the girl at Palakkad
is becoming serious.

801
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:17,528
l talked to the doctor over there.

802
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,701
Sir, the police vehicle is on the way.
- Good.

803
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,493
Vinoy, get ready to go.

804
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,330
Sorry, doctor, l can't go.

805
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,529
Thinking that it will be helicopter
l said okay first.

806
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:26,799
But this is too risky.

807
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,670
Please leave me out of it.
Please, doctor.

808
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:30,208
At the last minute you..

809
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,937
l have a surgery at 1 .30,
or else l would have gone.

810
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,115
Now..

811
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,282
Abel, can't you go?

812
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,284
Rajeev.

813
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,020
Sudevan.

814
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:43,285
Abel.

815
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:52,132
Let it go.
Move from the way.

816
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:30,059
Sudevan, switch on your mobile.
One important message.

817
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:39,247
Dr. Abel's wife met with an accident.
She is in the lCU now.

818
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,242
Don't tell him anything now.
You must drop him at the nextjunction.

819
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,318
From there another doctor
will be arranged.

820
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:48,512
Okay, sir.
- Now you can switch off.

821
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:08,769
You come to the junction near your office
an important thing to be told to you.

822
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,097
l will be there.

823
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,277
Turn the vehicle.

824
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,114
l said turn the vehicle.

825
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,656
The unexpected missing of the vehicle
has put the police in a spot.

826
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,385
They are thinking how to tackle it.

827
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:37,429
The van which was
moving right on time...

828
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:42,026
..must have turned in one of the
roads in the middle..

829
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:43,033
so the police suspects.

830
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:46,207
But without the instruction of the
police how did such a thing occur?

831
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,000
lt was to reach by evening.

832
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,973
Now we don't know how to give any hope..

833
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,721
Sir, please

834
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:05,922
Mathew..

835
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,391
Call Cochin and ask about
the situation at present.

836
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,995
We should also know what action
the police has taken, isn't it?

837
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,827
lf there is some pressure from our side also,
they will have some interest.

838
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:15,731
Siddu, you speak to them.

839
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,304
All the three numbers in the van
are switched off now.

840
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,940
So we are not able to trace
their location.

841
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:22,837
But one of the numbers was
put on in the middle.

842
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:23,567
The other two mobile..

843
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:27,680
Mathews, two messages have
gone to the mobiles in the van.

844
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:28,975
You must trace the location of the
mobile to which it goes.

845
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,516
When l get the details l will
give it to you, okay?

846
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:33,887
l want to know.
- Sir, we got something.

847
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,250
Where?
- This one.

848
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,753
Dr. Abel Therian.

849
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:29,573
Hey, Shaji.

850
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:25,189
Central

851
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,301
No.

852
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,711
Don't. l will throw it.

853
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:41,813
Hello, Maria.

854
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,212
We are on the way. Where are you?

855
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,719
l am here in Pudukkadu forest area.

856
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:49,212
What happened?

857
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,821
l think l killed Sweta.

858
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,560
lt is not something l deliberately did.
But it happened.

859
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,561
She was cheating me, Maria.

860
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,232
With Chiku...
My best..

861
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:07,902
How did you do it, Abel?

862
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,401
l hit her with a car.

863
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,008
l don't know, Maria.

864
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:18,015
l don't know how l did it.
l didn't ever think..

865
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:21,752
Maria, l..

866
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,920
Maria, l want to go somewhere.

867
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:34,867
l just want to run away from here.

868
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,938
Wait there.
We will reach there in fifteen minutes.

869
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:48,881
So we can confirm it, sir.

870
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,511
From the highway he is
deviating and coming.

871
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:52,777
James called and told now.

872
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,850
Vishnu, he is there only.
He is coming.

873
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:59,117
He will reach there. From forest area.
You wait there.

874
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,787
Sir, within 10 minutes Vishnu's
Trichur team will reach there.

875
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:05,962
Please come.

876
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,792
Please call after sometime.

877
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:11,502
Not able to get.

878
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,633
Call once more and try.

879
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,073
Hey, no. No.

880
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,719
Doctor, please listen to what l am saying.

881
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,752
l will be able to help you.

882
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:33,419
Hello.

883
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:39,565
Hello. l am Sidharth Shankar.
Priya is my daughter.

884
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,133
Please don't cut the call.
Look, doctor..

885
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,305
l will do whatever doctor wants
to be done.

886
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,770
lf you need security l will make
all the arrangements.

887
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:50,001
l have connections.
No one will disturb you from any side.

888
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,145
l will save you.
l can promise you that.

889
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,874
Hello. Hello. Look, doctor,
l can assure you that.

890
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,109
Doctor, please try to understand me.

891
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,285
Now listen carefully.

892
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,791
l don't know what your problems are.
And l don't want to know them either.

893
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:07,118
l want my daughter.
l want my daughter.

894
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,353
Nothing is bigger than that.
Neither you nor your problems.

895
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:13,699
Last 13 years l am waiting when
she will go beyond our reach.

896
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:15,535
Pray to God. Hope for the best.

897
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,500
l am fed up of hearing that.

898
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:20,299
Before me this day is just a prediction.

899
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,136
And you and your problem
is obstructing that.

900
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:24,402
Did you hear that?

901
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:28,479
ls your problem bigger than
my 13 years of worry?

902
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:12,086
Take it. Go. Go.

903
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:38,944
The woman who he called,
she won't come.

904
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:43,552
lnstead the police will come.
l know that.

905
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,618
He got it into the problem.

906
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:51,788
lnstead of what happened
we can give him an opportunity.

907
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,063
lt is we who have decided that.

908
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,879
Sudevan, Sudevan, tell me.

909
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,817
We have started again, sir.
lt is a muddy road through the forest.

910
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:20,251
At the moment it is going at 80 km
speed towards Trichur.

911
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,093
We will get in the first main road
that we will see.

912
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,766
Where is that doctor?
- He is with us.

913
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,699
What? Sudevan, for God's sake listen.

914
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:34,272
We have arranged another doctor.
He will join you at Trichur.

915
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,703
Dr. Abel, you..

916
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:39,869
l will take the responsibility of Dr. Abel.
He is enough for me in this mission.

917
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:41,708
Come on, Sudevan,
he is a criminal.

918
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:44,282
l will not allow you to continue
the mission with him.

919
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:47,680
As soon as you reach the main road,
you must give him in our custody.

920
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,618
Our people will be there.
Do you get me?

921
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,486
After the mission is over,
l myself will hand him over, sir.

922
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:53,922
You must leave this risk to me.

923
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:55,493
Sudevan, l don't know
why you are doing this.

924
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:56,493
We don't have any time now.

925
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,666
From now every minute is
worth 20 minutes.

926
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,357
lf you don't reach within the next 15 minutes
if you don't reach the Trichur, Mannati road..

927
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,469
then we will have to
stop the mission.

928
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:07,302
lf you come you will have to move at
the speed of 100kmph,

929
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,703
and we cannot take the
risk of having him with us.

930
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:13,472
lf you have trusted me in this mission
you will have to trust me in this also.

931
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,808
Sudevan..
- Please, sir. Trust me.

932
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,041
What about the wireless?

933
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,987
lt is disconnected, sir,
Rajeev is trying to connect it.

934
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,328
Now we are on the speaker phone.
- Switch it to the hand phone.

935
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,327
Yes, sir.
- Are you mad?

936
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:36,162
The one with you is a criminal
who has made a murder attempt.

937
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:37,968
Try to connect the wireless.

938
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:39,764
You can use the mobile only
when absolutely necessary.

939
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:41,999
And for no reason you can
put the speaker on.

940
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,075
Understand
- Yes, sir.

941
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:15,599
Central

942
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:27,045
Left or right?
- What is happening, Sudevan?

943
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,821
Sir, in front of me there are two roads.
Left and right.

944
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,255
Which way to take for Trichur?

945
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:36,453
Oh, where is this road?
Can you give me some identification?

946
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:38,628
No, sir.

947
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,028
With no cars or people around..

948
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:43,066
While seeing the geography..

949
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:47,140
Have you stopped van right now?
- Yes, sir.

950
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:51,376
See if you can find some on the way.
Or else see if you can find any sign board.

951
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:52,944
No, sir.
- lt must be left.

952
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:55,081
When you see the Geography it is left.

953
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,518
Sir, Rajeev says it must be left.
- No.

954
01:30:58,719 --> 01:30:59,879
Don't do anything without being sure.

955
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:03,022
lt is left, sir, l am telling you.
We are wasting time.

956
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:05,317
Didn't they say that we have to reach
Trichur within 15 minutes?

957
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,496
We are turning left, sir.

958
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:17,728
''Trichur''

959
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,934
People, please co-operate with us.

960
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,770
The instruction is only ambulances and
emergency vehicles can pass.

961
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:26,446
All others have to deviate
to the stadium road.

962
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:29,172
All the people should co-operate with
us forjust 10 minutes.

963
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:34,586
lf they have reached Trichur town
and compensate the time.

964
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:36,256
that we have lost we cannot travel by
the route that we had planned before.

965
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:37,583
We should take this route.

966
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,259
But what is the problem
in this route means..

967
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:42,327
The mobile number you are calling
is out of coverage area.

968
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:44,020
lt is out of coverage area.

969
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:45,360
The time is already over.

970
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:48,296
For the last 15 minutes they are blocking the
road and waiting at Mannati and waiting.

971
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:52,001
Yes, Vishnu.- We reached the
spot which you told us, sir.

972
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:54,367
They are not here.
l feel that they are..

973
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:57,703
Vishnu, they are moving, it is okay.
Thanks.

974
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:58,640
Okay, sir.

975
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:02,612
And Vishnu, are you sure they
have not crossed you and gone?

976
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:04,876
We are sure, sir.
- What if you have missed him?

977
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:08,487
Never, sir. They have not crossed us.
l am sure.

978
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:10,387
Okay. Thanks.

979
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,892
They have missed the road somewhere.

980
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,065
Then we have to..
- No, sir.

981
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:29,576
we have come this far, isn't it?

982
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:33,904
Let us wait a little while more.
- Did they miss the road?

983
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:37,744
Or the doctor who is with them did some
new drama, we don't know.

984
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,920
Sir, at least till the time he
comes back in the range..

985
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,216
What is the use of coming
within the range?

986
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:44,948
Now itself we are way too behind.

987
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:47,684
Now we have only one hour
with us in our hand.

988
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:50,363
No luck, sir.
Rajeev's phone is switched off.

989
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,207
Call the commissioner sir and tell him that
we will reach the main road soon.

990
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:05,777
The last outgoing call.

991
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,049
No range, sir.
- Call from your phone.

992
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,793
Sir, it is 18 minutes since
we blocked the road.

993
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:21,295
What should we do?

994
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,463
Sir, should we wait longer?

995
01:33:29,203 --> 01:33:32,297
Don't. The mission is cancelled.

996
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:44,147
Mission cancelled, roads to be cleared
and signals to be back to normal.

997
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:48,920
Sir..

998
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,918
Sudevan, the mission is cancelled.

999
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:53,684
Sir, please don't cancel the mission.

1000
01:33:53,894 --> 01:33:56,055
We are just reaching the main road.
- As if you are really reaching.

1001
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:58,128
l had told you to confirm
the road and move.

1002
01:33:58,332 --> 01:34:00,926
Sir, we have reached.
We can see the main road.

1003
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,762
At the most it is 100 meters now.

1004
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:09,670
The van hasn't entered.

1005
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:16,612
We have entered the main road.
Moving at 90 kms.

1006
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:21,618
Pravin. are you sure?
- l am very sure.

1007
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:22,846
The van hasn't entered, sir.

1008
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:25,582
Pravin, are you sure?
- l am very sure.

1009
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:27,852
Sir, emergency call. From Trivandrum.

1010
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:32,089
Hello.
- Yes sir.

1011
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:33,960
They have entered on the Vaniampara route.

1012
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,193
lt is a road which is 8 km
from the Trichur town.

1013
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:41,030
That they made a mistake
to the Trichur town is right.

1014
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:42,971
But it is a perfect mistake.

1015
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:46,738
They are 8 Kms in front of the road that
we thought they will come in and enter.

1016
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:49,211
Which means?
- Which means the mission is on.

1017
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:01,987
Hello.
- Hello.

1018
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:05,457
Madam, one Mr. Vetri from Times..

1019
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,429
To know if you can give information...

1020
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:09,899
...if the ambulance connected to the
heart can pass through the city.

1021
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:13,699
For the co-operation of the public.
But l said we can't.

1022
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:16,001
Because it doesn't have the
entertainment value that we need.

1023
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,078
No, after the nextjingle we have
to start the announcement.

1024
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:22,715
Whichever program gets delayed,
it doesn't matter.

1025
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:24,350
Got it?
- Yes, madam.

1026
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:41,600
Abel, Sweta is out of danger.

1027
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:44,268
She will be conscious soon.

1028
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:10,954
Central

1029
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:23,903
ln the next 10 minutes the vehicle
will reach the main road.

1030
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,375
The vehicle will pass
by Trichur Paalakkad road.

1031
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:28,878
Please allow the vehicle to pass.

1032
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:31,847
Maybe that will save a life.
We should do what we can.

1033
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:34,316
Maybe that we can be
proud of that later.

1034
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:40,753
Yes, sir, they have reached.

1035
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:45,826
Hello, can you hear me, sir? Hello!

1036
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:48,495
Hello, can you hear me, sir?

1037
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:50,602
Yes, l can.
- Great.

1038
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:54,936
Now there is 85 kms.
We have 45 minutes.

1039
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:57,838
Possible if roads are clear.
Maintain speed.

1040
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:03,846
We are just 45 minutes away
from success.

1041
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:18,360
The visitors are shouting in the
room there and are increasing.

1042
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:20,397
And in the lobby the phone is engaged.

1043
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:24,203
You had given an interview
today morning, hadn't you?

1044
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:31,471
Some sort of it that l gave.

1045
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,045
Till the time she reaches here
her condition will become so..

1046
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:43,348
After the surgery is over,
mother had said she will come.

1047
01:37:43,557 --> 01:37:44,888
Tell her not to come.

1048
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:49,729
l will be here.

1049
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:53,325
l have told Mathews to postpone quite
a lot of engagements.

1050
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,563
Then you have the alternative
to postpone, don't you?

1051
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:03,333
But the reason should be
something like this.

1052
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:06,840
Telling you of other important
things is of no use, is it?

1053
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,616
Hello!

1054
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:12,911
Yes, okay.

1055
01:38:14,922 --> 01:38:16,480
ln your busy time in-between you
should turn and see.

1056
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:19,352
Amongst the things that you have
neglected her childhood is there.

1057
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:29,760
ln between some 15 days,
orjust 10 days should keep aside for her.

1058
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:36,699
But if you say all this running is for her
future, then l won't believe it.

1059
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:46,442
All this was for showing off to your friends and
colleagues or to by the latest model Caravan..

1060
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:48,281
which others can't buy,
for your ego boost?

1061
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:55,791
She may say that she is the
daughter of Siddharth Shankar

1062
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:57,623
but she will do only that.

1063
01:38:57,831 --> 01:39:01,232
But if she has any problem in her life she will
never come with it in front of you.

1064
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:04,467
You are the biggest failure
as her father.

1065
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:59,356
She has many close friends
in all places.

1066
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:08,433
Debu, what is the name of the girl
that was in the hospital?

1067
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:13,035
Aditi.

1068
01:40:15,242 --> 01:40:16,573
Where is that girl now?

1069
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:51,642
Hello!
- l am Reehan's father.

1070
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,584
Her mother and l are now at her home.

1071
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:03,481
Can Aditi come here?

1072
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:13,929
l will come.

1073
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:30,747
Priya's heartbeat has abnormal variations.
Condition is very bad, doctor.

1074
01:41:30,951 --> 01:41:34,682
lf we don't start her surgery within
half an hour we will lose her.

1075
01:41:47,034 --> 01:41:49,264
Dr. Abel, can you hear me?
- Yes, tell me.

1076
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:52,462
Priya's BP is becoming dangerously low.
Her pulse is also weak.

1077
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:55,267
lf there is no surety of reaching in time,
then it is better to put her on ventilator.

1078
01:41:55,476 --> 01:41:58,377
Hello, if you put her on ventilator then
we won't be able to save her.

1079
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:00,069
Take her to the operation theatre.

1080
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,371
Start all the procedures for surgery.

1081
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:04,483
See her vital signs and give
her anaesthesia.

1082
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:07,585
Doctor, we will be there on time.

1083
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:23,863
Within 30 minutes 78 kms.

1084
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:27,165
As per the plan we have
40 minutes balance.

1085
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:29,675
Now we have only one way in front of us.

1086
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:30,934
Billal colony.

1087
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:35,672
lf they have to reach within 30 minutes then
we have to pass through Billal colony.

1088
01:42:36,383 --> 01:42:38,510
The colony is joined with the mosque.

1089
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,619
Minorities are very strong over there.

1090
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:43,289
The police cannot suddenly get in there.

1091
01:42:43,724 --> 01:42:48,684
Few times we tried for catching black market
goods, there was even firing at this place.

1092
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:53,522
lf they can cross the colony with the same
speed then the mission will be a success.

1093
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:54,629
That is sure.

1094
01:42:55,302 --> 01:43:01,207
But it is a very crowded area, a lot of shops
and many customers coming from outside.

1095
01:43:02,576 --> 01:43:05,477
l don't know.
l really don't know.

1096
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:10,215
Billal colony, l know that place.

1097
01:43:10,584 --> 01:43:13,849
We have gone there many times
to get dvd for foreign tourists.

1098
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:15,248
lt is a very crowded place.

1099
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:17,889
lf we go through that place
we will surely get stuck.

1100
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:26,661
Sir, l want the number of Siddharth Shankar's
secretary Mathew's number.

1101
01:43:26,967 --> 01:43:27,456
What?

1102
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:30,899
l will tell you, sir. A last try,
please give me his number.

1103
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:51,414
Central

1104
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:05,764
Ranjit, who is the secretary of our
Billal colony fan's association.

1105
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:08,269
lt is our Sanjira. Sanjira.

1106
01:44:08,475 --> 01:44:10,033
The man is here.
l will give him the phone.

1107
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:14,271
Sanjir... Sanjir...

1108
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:17,382
Sanjirkka. Sanjirkka.

1109
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:18,209
Sanjirkka. Sanjirkka. Phone, Phone,

1110
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:21,216
Basher, it is great.
The film is a great hit.

1111
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:23,047
Who?
- Mathew sir. Mathew sir.

1112
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:25,958
The film is a great hit.

1113
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:27,791
One second.

1114
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:34,767
Hello, l am Siddharth Shankar.
l want a help from you.

1115
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:35,957
You tell me, sir.

1116
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,907
Sir, we are there, sir.

1117
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,412
Jamure, Razak, get the bikes. Come.

1118
01:44:50,717 --> 01:44:51,741
Let us go.

1119
01:44:59,092 --> 01:45:02,584
Just at the start the road is broad but
as we go inside the road narrows.

1120
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:04,764
Only one car can go with difficulty.

1121
01:45:05,098 --> 01:45:06,122
Be very, very careful.

1122
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:07,595
l am there when you enter the colony.

1123
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,201
l know the place very well.
There are a lot of lanes.

1124
01:45:10,404 --> 01:45:13,271
Before you reach l will make
sure that. The roads are clear.

1125
01:45:13,907 --> 01:45:17,343
Doctor, l need your number.
lf there is any emergency l will call.

1126
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:21,672
Hello, Sanji, we are entering the colony.

1127
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:25,084
For whatever reason no vehicle should
come opposite to our vehicle.

1128
01:45:25,285 --> 01:45:28,277
This is our place, sir.
Just leave it to us.

1129
01:45:46,573 --> 01:45:56,539
Central

1130
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:12,323
Many obstacles that one hasn't
seen are waiting.

1131
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:17,492
Time is less, so it is very important
that we clear all these.

1132
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:20,002
l will jump at the junction
but don't slow down.

1133
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:23,335
Are you sure.
- Take care.

1134
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:27,302
There some effort is made to clear them.

1135
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:31,006
Every minute is precious for them.

1136
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:38,249
They have to fly at a fast speed.

1137
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:41,859
Many obstacles that one hasn't
seen are waiting.

1138
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:45,589
Time is less, so it is very important
that we clear all these.

1139
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:49,291
lt all seems like a day dream.

1140
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:53,530
Many impossible things are
done in very little time.

1141
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:16,619
Central

1142
01:47:26,339 --> 01:47:29,740
All of you please clear the road
and let the van pass through.

1143
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:48,321
Clear the road. Move aside.

1144
01:47:48,528 --> 01:47:52,157
There is a car on road,
l will clear it now and give.

1145
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:57,993
Hey, which fool has parked
his vehicle in the middle?

1146
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:03,166
Hello! Two vehicles are blocking
the road. Clear them immediately.

1147
01:48:03,376 --> 01:48:14,378
Anyone seeing the speed with which this is
one will make them wonder how they do so.

1148
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:18,285
Come, come.

1149
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:23,356
Come, come. Come, come.

1150
01:48:24,731 --> 01:48:34,697
Central

1151
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:42,105
Many obstacles that one hasn't
seen are waiting.

1152
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:45,876
Time is less, so it is very important
that we clear all these.

1153
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:49,487
There some effort is made
to clear them.

1154
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:52,351
Every minute is precious for them.

You go with him. l will join you.

1157
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:11,803
Many obstacles that one hasn't
seen are waiting.

1158
01:49:12,012 --> 01:49:15,413
Time is less, so it is very important
that we clear all these.

1159
01:49:15,615 --> 01:49:23,078
lt all seems like a daydream.

1160
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:26,691
There some effort is made
to clear them.

The Kerala Police has done a wonderful job
in this that has become obvious here.

lt is the brilliance and
talent of the traffic constable..

Sudevan Nair, that has to be
appreciated by one and all.

1175
01:52:37,684 --> 01:52:41,051
lt was a duty that others didn't dare to take
it up and so he deserves all the credit for it.

1176
01:52:41,187 --> 01:52:44,350
He overcame many obstacles during the
journey and reached the destination on time.

1177
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:01,130
Kochi.

No.

Can't you see the vehicle coming?

01:54:34,767 --> 01:54:36,234
And now you will blame
the other person.

You came after l came here.
No one say anything.
