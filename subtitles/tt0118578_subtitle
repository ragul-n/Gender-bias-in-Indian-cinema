1
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,345
I will tell you everything.

2
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:29,894
I saw a kid crying.

3
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:34,691
His father died for he was a drunkard.

4
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:39,535
The kid stands all alone crying.

5
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:46,304
I saw that child has grown up.

6
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:53,452
Many men and women are with him.

7
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,281
There are all standing in a church.

8
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:59,588
Absolutely right, Ma'am.

9
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:02,628
I'm a guide, so usually people flock around me.

10
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,596
I also pay visit to church dally.

11
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:08,430
But I want to be an affluent man. I've a else way to go.

12
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:11,835
My past is gone. 
What is my future? tell me!

13
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:30,188
I can visualise your princess..

14
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:36,560
..your dream girl, whom you were waiting till this day.

15
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,798
That blue eyed damsel..

16
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,630
..slim and beautiful.

17
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:52,638
Smilingly she steps towards you.

18
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,510
You're going with her.

19
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,811
Abroad.

20
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:05,852
I also see an airplane zooming high in the sky.

21
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,883
Sonia, the flight is delayed for 5 hours.

22
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,323
5 hours.

23
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:16,226
Shall we go to the lounge?

24
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:20,392
No granny, you go ahead.
I'll go to the bookshop and come.

25
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,750
A strange husband you are
Phiroze. - Of course!

00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,139
It's 25 years since

33
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,873
.. and you forgot where we
had ceIebrated our honeymoon.

34
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,575

And you've never ever gifted
a one penny chocoIate to me.

00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:38,701
Never took me for an outing!
Do you take me to be your wife?

00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,366
Is it? I'll eat you raw.

139
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,375
No tea for you. I won't

From where did you get this cat?

- A tourist was seIIing it.
It also contains..

145
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,782
..a tape recorder.
- Really.

146
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,454
Record some good things in
it, I'll hear it Iater.

147
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,861
Why did you waste your money
for the tape recorder?

148
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:42,833
- I can talk straight forward
with you. - Right? Now, say..

00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:58,507
Do you know, nanny? - Yes.

..warm breeze fondIed me.

156
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:26,371
You never saw your mother and
still you love her so much.

157
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,612
Mom was a nice Iady,
wasn't she? - Indeed!

158
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:37,382
Then why didn't she
go to Austria with papa?

159
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,947
For she didn't want
to Ieave India.

160
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,487
Where did she Iive in MaIaga?

161
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:47,325
I don't know.

162
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,526
Don't break your promise.

my mothers grave is.

164

165
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:10,916

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,927

167
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:24,366
Nanny please! please.

She is in the room,
but why doesn't she come.

00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:10,492

284
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,641

This decision of the heart is

Hey! You take away my heart!

If the weather teases you..

298
00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:09,140
..then how can anyone escape?

299
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:12,615
Like the wonderful fragrance..

300
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:16,142
..we both are similar to that.

301
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:20,590

..whoever they looks at,
they make him crazy.

309
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:23,278
You are a bit crazy.

310
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:27,155
You are a floating cloud.

311
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:31,184
No one knows my pain here.

312
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:34,460

Hey! You take away my heart!

Gabru, why are you always seen in winter wear?

322
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:34,083
I told you, I feel the psychological chill for the whole year.

323
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,959
Neena, Tony is not be seen around nowadays.

324
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:43,831
Don't you know, he is a guide?
He must be with his tourist.

No. Listen.. he in not guiding the tourist. 
She is a girl.

00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:51,970
She is guiding him. Yesterday,
he was dancing around with her.

327
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:55,774
Did you see? 
- Yes. He was roaming with his hand around her waist.

328
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:59,715
- Hey! What's wrong with you? 
- C'mon, get up.

329

I love you. 
That's why I am telling you.

330
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,955
Discard Tony's thoughts off your mind.

Dear, what to say.. that Madam.. she is too good!

335
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,087
You will be happy to meet her.

336
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:45,026
And the biggest highlight in her that she is not hot tempered.

337
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,688
Being so beautiful,
she is not hot tempered.

338
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:49,893
And today she did something amazing!
Today she offered me to dance with her

339
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,436
I danced in such a way that she was stunned.

340
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:55,837
- Did you cook? 
- I've served your food. 
- Very good.

341
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:59,365
Had it not been for you,
I'd have starved.

342
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:20,895
Wow! Neena! 
She is not good looking but she is useful.

343
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:55,296
Hey Neena. Neena.

344
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,891
Hey Nee..na.

345
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:03,830
Hey Nee.. Nee.. Nee..na.

346
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,969
Tony, what happened? 
- Water!

347
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:10,173
- Water?! 
- Why was the food as such?

348
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:14,082
Here's the water. only for you. 
- That's the water from the flush.

349
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:18,851
Is this a glass? 
Throw it away! Give me clean water.

350
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:23,257
Give me water. 
- I'll not give you water.

351
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:25,262
tell me, what do I hear about this Madam.

352
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,390
Nothing. She's my customer.
What else?

353
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:31,264
I wash your clothes..
cook for you..

354
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:33,065
And you enjoy with the Ma'am, eh?

355
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:35,799
There's no harm in dancing with her.

356
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:40,743
Leave my hand. 
C'mon, get me some water.

357
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:43,337
You may die of hiccups,
but I won't give you water.

358
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:48,351
Die okay. - Neena please! Neena!
What do you think of yourself?

359
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:56,924
Stupid! Idiot! 
You bloody basket of flowers!

360
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,766
Leave me. I will kill you.

361
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:09,373
It's so peaceful here, isn't it?

362
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,965
You people are so lucky.

363
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:13,704
You don't have any problems in life.

364
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:17,179
Damn the luck!
 What are you talking? - Really?

365
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:21,241
- I couldn't sleep the whole night. 
- Why?

366
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,378
Hadn't I reached on time they would've committed suicide.

367
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:27,083
- Who? 
- Vasu and Sapna, my friends.

368
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:29,649
They love each other.

369
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:33,857
Their parents don't allow them to meet. 

370
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:36,924
Whenever they get a chance and tread into their dream world..

371
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,662
.. this world doesn't let them live in peace and ..

372
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:42,331
.. God doesn't let them die.

373
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:48,073
But no one can stop lovers.
They usually try to die.

374
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:53,948
Vasu too met the same fate.
He didn't listen to anyone.

375
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:57,681
He shouted and told the world.. Bye,..

376
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:01,156
..we are going from this world.
- Tony, you'll fall.

377
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:03,819
I was trying to make him see reason. 
But he didn't listen.

378
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:06,921
Tony, come down. 
- I requested him in the same way.

379
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:09,261
Tony please! 
- I kept requesting him in the same way..

380
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,268
..but he did not listen to me.

381
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:20,767
Tony. Tony. Oh God! Help!

382
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:27,978
Water! That should help!
- This water is dirty.

383
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:29,986
Use Mineral, Ma'am. 
- You rascal.

384
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:49,840
Good morning ma'am.
- Hey good morning.

385
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:53,399
Very good morning ma'am.
- Let's go.

386
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:57,312
Where's the car?

387
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:03,142
Oh! So what? Then, let's go on the bike.

388
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:10,719
- will my bike do? Who is that?
- Nobody is there. - Let's go.

389
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:17,833
Hold me. - Sure.

390
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:30,069
- I will take you Malaga in 2 hours. 
- I see.

391
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:32,844
What is the matter you are looking very beautiful.

392
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,976
Today is my birthday.

393
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:38,750
Many happy returns of the day. 
- Thank you.

394
00:39:38,823 --> 00:39:42,919
- How old are you? 
- You should never ask a girl her age.

395
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:46,157
But you aren't old. 
Why should you hide your age?

396
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,326
Very charming. all right.
I'll tell you.. 24

398
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:29,863

399
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,122

400
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:51,987

402

403
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:24,294

404
00:41:24,362 --> 00:41:27,160

Neena, I want to say that..
I love you.

408
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:55,020
Hey fink! You propose to every second girl you see.

409
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:56,719
What do you think of yourself? 
Ever..

410
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:57,988
..looked at yourself in mirror?

411
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:00,826
Why are you jealous? 
He wasn't talking about your girl friend.

412
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:04,390
You can never be my girl friend. 
Ever seen yourself?

413
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:07,164
You are thin like a prawn fish.

414
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:12,141
I, a prawn fish! 
And what about your madam?

415
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,871
She is a mermaid, is she?

416
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:17,312
Indeed! She is a mermaid.
She is so beautiful!

417
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:22,409
Have you ever seen her? 
Her eyes.., hair.., her smile..

418
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:24,420
Everything of hers is beautiful! 
She's a princess!

419
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,422
Damn your princess!
Bloody idiot!

420
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,084
You haven't seen her, isn't it? 
Look at her snap.

421
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,958
I was dancing with her. Look..

422
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:33,826
Get lost! 
I don't want to see it.

423
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:37,891
I'm getting wild. I'm leaving.
- You'll stay here.

424
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:43,032
Get lost or else I'll break your legs.

425
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:45,735
Look! I'm also someone's child.

426
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,247
child, eh! You can father a couple of children! Get lost!

427
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:54,148
Get lost!
- Move.. - Get lost!

428
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:03,384
Do you think yourself Prince.
Ever looked at yourself? - Get lost!

429
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:06,191
She considers herself as Samantha Fox. 
- Idiot!

430
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:09,722
- She thinks herself beautiful.
- Your madam...

431
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,325
She does not get the right guy.

432
00:43:58,115 --> 00:44:04,953
Tony, what's so special about her that I lack?

433
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:19,402
You lack courage. You love me, but you've never expressed it.

434
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,698
Had Madam been in your place,..

435
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,671
..she would've accepted before the whole..

436
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,334
..world that she loved me.

437
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:27,877
She'd have danced and screamed.

438
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:32,746
Know why? Because she's quite bold. 
Not like you.

439
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:52,795
Your veil slipped away from your head.

440
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:21,688
Your veil slipped away from your head.

441
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:28,933
Your veil got stuck to me.

442
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:33,272
The magic of your love has been cast on me.

443
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:38,976
I have no control over my heart.

444
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:45,353
My veil slipped away from my head.

445
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:52,685
My veiI got stuck to you.

446
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:56,859
The magic of your love has been cast on me.

447
00:45:56,934 --> 00:46:02,372
I have no control over my heart.

448
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:09,676
Your veil slipped away from your head.

449
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:38,402
Wonder when you stole my peace of mind, I did not realize.

450
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:46,076
You have made me crazy by giving me sleepless nights.

451
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,381
My sight has not shifted even for a moment..

452
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:53,014
..since it has seen you.

453
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,856
Don't act crazy..

454
00:46:56,927 --> 00:47:02,365
..you have my swear.

455
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:08,838
My veil slipped away from my head.

456
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:16,369
My veiI got stuck to you.

457
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:20,349
The magic of your love has been cast on me.

458
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:26,185
I have no control over my heart.

459
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:33,163
Your veil slipped away from your head.

460
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:06,193
What state have you made of mine..

461
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:09,289
..the pain does not go.

462
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:13,666
There is a fogginess in my thoughts..

463
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:16,797
..I do not get consciousness.

464
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:20,776
What sort of colour has spread on me..

465
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:23,836
..of love.

466
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:28,010
I have just realized..

467
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:33,318
..about your love.

468
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:39,989
Your veil slipped away from your head.

469
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:47,227
Your veil got stuck to me.

470
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:51,206
The magic of your love has been cast on me.

471
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:56,907
I have no controI over my heart.

472
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,212
From your head..
- Yes, from my head.

473
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:07,690
Your veil slipped away from your head.

474
00:49:22,806 --> 00:49:27,368
Good morning.
- Tony I'll kill you.

475
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:31,380
Bloody basket of flowers.
Tony you are monkey.

476
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:48,891
Ma'am this is Malaga's grand beach.

477
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:51,662
Many activities like boating, yachting, rowing,..

478
00:49:51,735 --> 00:49:54,932
..romancing goes on here.

479
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:59,374
Leave it..

480
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:02,311
What are you doing, Ma'am?

481
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:05,075
- I'll ride the bike. 
- Have you driven before?

482
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:07,014
No. I'll ride it for the first time today.

483
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:08,676
No, don't do it. In fact say,
I'll try it for the first time.

484
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:10,413
But it is a really nice bike.

485
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:12,421
Don't take risk Ma'am.
The bike is new.

486
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:17,426
I've to pay the remaining six installments.

487
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,929
So what? 
You can teach me.

488
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:23,967
I? 
Teach you?

489
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:27,003
I'll teach you. 
I don't mind.

490
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:36,041
One minute. 
Move a little ahead.

491
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:42,215
Now keep you right foot here.. 
and Ieft foot here.

492
00:50:44,722 --> 00:50:46,155
One minute.

493
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:19,251
I am sorry, I am sorry.

494
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:21,951
- What happened? 
- The bike broke down.

495
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:24,289
- Why has it stopped? 
- It has run out of petrol Ma'am.

496
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:26,056
Now what?

497
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,864
Now only two things are possible. 
One, we both sing together.

498
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:37,840
Or else we've to take refuge in some hut like in Hindi films.

499
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:41,868
Cut it out, Tony! 
Come on let's go and ask for a life. Let's go.

500
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:48,918
Madam, one minute.. Bike..

501
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:56,149
Angels in the night.
Exchanging glances.

502
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:59,923
Wandering in the night.
Whatever chances.

503
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:11,506
Hey! What are you doing?
Getting a cart in the hotel?

504
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:17,013
- A cart is not allowed in. 
- But I can get the bike Atleast.

505
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,708
Bullock cart is not allowed in a five star hotel.

506
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:22,115
I know. 
But a bike is allowed, isn't it?

507
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:23,949
You can bring a bike.

508
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:25,784
Then, I've brought the bike.
- But this is a cart.

509
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:28,518
- This is a bike. 
- Why did you confuse us?

510
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:31,083
Catch him. 
He has kidnapped Sonia.

511
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:32,560
What are you saying?

512
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:35,860
Return my Sonia or else I'll strangle you.

513
00:52:35,933 --> 00:52:38,527
talking about strangling me, eh!

514
00:52:38,602 --> 00:52:40,763
Her father is a rich man.

515
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:45,002
- I know. He must be about 60 years old. 
- She's a princess.

516
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:50,206
You will position your hands properly!

517
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,512
Your princess is sleeping there.

518
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:56,143
Oh my God. 
- Oh my God.

519
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,485
Hey, you people too? 
You've ruined my reputation.

520
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,558
Have we reached.

521
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:19,431
My reputation is ruined.
- Thank you, Tony.

522
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,604
I'll never forget this day my entire life.

523
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,981
What is the need to thank me, ma'am?

524
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:28,108
I too will not forget this day.

525
00:53:29,953 --> 00:53:31,944
Good night. 
- Good night.

526
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:39,462
Tony, don't come from tomorrow..

527
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,522
..we'll look out for another guide.

528
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,467
But aunty.. Damn it!..

529
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:50,735
I don't understand.

530
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:54,875
Why is a flower always accompanied by a thorn?

531
00:53:56,947 --> 00:53:59,211
She is a thorn! 
Very big thorn!

532
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:07,419
Bad luck! 
I'm also here since morning..

533
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:12,827
..but couIdn't catch a fish. 
And your basket, it's full. I'm unfortunate.

534
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:19,433
Whenever I think that something good is going to happen in my life..

535
00:54:19,503 --> 00:54:23,667
..something or the other untoward happens.

536
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,073
Now, what's the problem with you?

537
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:30,944
Don't you get tense.
Nanny told me..

538
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:34,609
..she'll change the guide.

539
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:38,018
I'll not go there now. 
I told her to change the guide.

540
00:54:38,088 --> 00:54:42,047
- I'll not talk to Madam too.
- Really? Promise!

541
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:45,458
I swear on you! I challenge.
I will never talk to her.

542
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:48,987
Tony! 
- Yes, Madam..

543
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:51,864
How can.. WeIcome!
Where are you?

544
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,867
How come you have come.
- I just came searching for you.

545
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,137
You are angry. 
So I must coax you.

546
00:55:01,545 --> 00:55:05,709
I'm not angry with you. 
I can never be angry with you.

547
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:08,478
What are you saying?
I'll die if I do so.

548
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:12,955
I'll die if I do so. One
doesn't get angry on near one's.

549
00:55:13,657 --> 00:55:16,990
Ma'am. This is Neena.
Neena. Yea ma'am.

550
00:55:22,032 --> 00:55:24,091
Tony is fulI of praises for you.

551
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:25,828
Heard that?

552
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:27,802
But Tony has never told
me anything about you.

553
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:32,535
Hey! Liar! She is such a big Iiar!
- Tony! - Tony! Don't worry.

554
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,440
Ma'am, I always think about you. 
Be frank..

555
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:38,174
..you had your breakfast?
- Yes. - Had your lunch? - Yes.

556
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:45,182
He worries so much! - I have to!
- Did you have your milk? - Yeah!

557
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:51,490
Here there is a lot of tension.
Like this.

558
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:53,552
I think, he's talking about himself.

559
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,825
Saw? 
She learnt how to talk because of me.

560
00:55:56,667 --> 00:56:00,763
- May I tell you? - Yes 
- I'm tensed because of only two people.

561
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:04,705
One is Neena and the other is your nanny. 
You don't mind?

562
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:07,539
No of course not. 
- Then come.

563
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:12,014
See you Neena. 
- I've to see her that is the problem of my life. Come, come.

564
00:56:22,025 --> 00:56:24,425
The temple of Lord Krishna and Radha. 
- Oh!

565
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:27,757
The symbol of love. Come. 
- Come.

566
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:02,123
What's this? 
- This is total surrender. - Oh!

567
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:26,679
- Okay. 
- Not you..

568
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:29,419
Why Tony? 
- Not you.

569
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:35,591
You will do it when you wear a sari.

570
00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:42,762
Now. 
- It is offerings.

571
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:10,656
Ma'am. - Tony. 
- Ma'am.

572
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:17,035
It's really bad. 
- What?

573
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,069
I don't want to talk to you. 
- Why?

574
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:24,739
I don't wish to speak to you. 
- But why Tony?

575
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:30,082
I searched for you everywhere.
In temple.. in church..

576
00:58:30,153 --> 00:58:31,745
I asked everyone about you.
But I couldn't trace you.

577
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:33,585
But Tony, in Goa I..

578
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:35,420
What if something had happened to you?..

579
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:37,483
..I'd have been disgraced in Goa.

580
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:43,530
I'd have been the talk of the town.

581
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,433
Where can I go in Goa?
I was on the beach.

582
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:50,534
You should've taken me.
Why did you go alone?

583
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:52,768
Alright. I'll remember.
Take this.

584
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:56,711
Very bad. 
- Present, Tony. Present.

585
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,442
- For me? 
- Just like that.

586
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:03,851
- Costly? 
- Did you like it? tell me.

587
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:10,659
Rs. 6000/-! 
Who sold this scarf to you for 6000/-?

588
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:12,991
Let it be. Wear it and show me.

589
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:14,997
A scarf worth Rs. 6,000/-!

590
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:21,131
In this much..
I've no heart to wear it.

591
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:31,140
Not this way. Wear it this way. 
You'll look good.

592
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:38,145
Raise you head.

593
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:45,961
You are looking so good.

594
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,431
Shall I tell you something, Ma'am?

595
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,958
No one has ever gifted me this way.

596
00:59:54,037 --> 00:59:56,835
Worth six thousand rupees..!

597
00:59:56,907 --> 01:00:00,172
But you are looking handsome. 
So cute.

598
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:08,643
I was unaware of the magic of love.

599
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:13,951
I'm besotted and fanatical.

600
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:18,017
You are crazy, you did
not reallze this much.

601
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:23,623
You are besotted and fanatical.

602
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:46,087
I was unaware of the magic of love.

603
01:00:46,156 --> 01:00:50,957
I'm besotted and fanatical.

604
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:55,225
You are crazy, you did not realize this much.

605
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:59,826
You are besotted and fanatical.

606
01:00:59,903 --> 01:01:04,533
I was unaware of the magic of love.

607
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:09,044
I'm besotted and fanatical.

608
01:01:09,112 --> 01:01:13,742
You are crazy, you did not realize this much.

609
01:01:13,817 --> 01:01:18,550
You are besotted and fanatical.

610
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:46,742
You stay in my eyelids.

611
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:51,753
all night yesterday,
I dreamt about you.

612
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:55,917
How do I tell you?
How restless I was!

613
01:01:55,992 --> 01:02:00,622
I did not have peace for even a moment.

614
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:07,159
My heart tells me, that it is difficult to explain anything to you.

615
01:02:07,437 --> 01:02:11,931
You are besotted and fanatical.

616
01:02:12,008 --> 01:02:16,445
I was unaware of the magic of love.

617
01:02:16,513 --> 01:02:21,041
I'm besotted and fanatical.

618
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:26,111
You are crazy, you did not realize this much.

619
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:53,848
What magic have you cast on my heartbeats?

620
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:58,718
My crazy mind has started dancing.

621
01:02:58,788 --> 01:03:03,157
When I look at you, I feel loved.

622
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:07,993
When I take the name of God,
your name comes before that.

623
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:14,162
You have a right over my life.
I was unaware about all this.

624
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:18,965
I'm besotted and fanatical.

625
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:23,570
You are crazy, you did not realize this much.

626
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:28,140
You are besotted and fanatical.

627
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:32,882
I was unaware of the magic of love.

628
01:03:32,956 --> 01:03:37,723
I'm besotted and fanatical.

629
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:41,958
You are besotted and fanatical.

630
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:47,196
I'm besotted and fanaticaI.

631
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:08,989
Ma'am! Ma'am! I've good news for you.

632
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:18,698
I hope you'll not be sad.

633
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:24,502
- Why? What happened? 
- I've found your mother's grave.

634
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:30,979
You won't be sad? 
will you come with me?

635
01:04:45,595 --> 01:04:47,790
That one.

636
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:58,667
- Madam.. - Yes...
- This is from my side.

637
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:11,103
The sunset is so beautiful!
And you look so depressed.

638
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:15,508
Just smile once and all your sorrows will vanish away.

639
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:19,412
You know how to flirt very well.
- No, I am speaking the truth.

640
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:23,145
If you don't believe me,
then see for yourself.

641
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:27,053
I'm feeling depressed today.

642
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:28,556
Why?

643
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:33,823
Now my job is over.
I'll have to go.

644
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,589
You will go away?

645
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:45,499
There's no reason to stay back.
I'll miss you a lot, Tony.

646
01:07:49,178 --> 01:07:55,481
I'll take a snap of yours.
Stand there.

647
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:58,714
Go. Go.

648
01:09:48,965 --> 01:09:50,023
Hello! 
How are you?

649
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,260
Hello Mr. Prem Arya? 
He is Mr. Khan. Indian ambassador.

650
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,002
Anyway, what's the schedule?

651
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:07,140
The programme is tomorrow. 
We've to go to the Governor's party today.

652
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:11,277
He is the one who had come to India as a member of Australia.

653
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:12,878
Yes.

654
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:14,013
I would like to take his interview. 
Is it possible?

655
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:19,221
It's tough but I'll try. 
He doesn't like being interviewed.

656
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:22,822
Especially to the Indian journalist Anyway..

657
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:25,163
..you don't worry. 
I'll talk to him.

658
01:10:25,234 --> 01:10:26,895
Great.

01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:37,902
Good morning, Mr. Prem Arya.
- Good morning, sir.

660
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:41,447
How do you do? 
Thank you for giving me an opportunity.

661
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:42,916
An Indian on time!

662
01:10:46,188 --> 01:10:49,180
Strange!
 An Indian that too on time?!

663
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:53,319
Indians possess the strength to move ahead of time.

664
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:54,863
Very good.

665
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:56,057
Nice reply!

666
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:58,191
Are you comfortable? 
Absolutely sir. Thank you so much.

667
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:00,531
Go ahead. Ask your questions.

668
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:02,929
Excuse me.

669
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:04,937
For how many years did you live in India?

670
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:07,134
- 8 years. 
- How was the experience?

671
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:10,269
- Beautiful! 
- Do you remember India?

672
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:14,543
I can never forget India.

673
01:11:14,884 --> 01:11:17,944
Then, why didn't you..

674
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:21,285
..return to India inspite of having a relation with it?

675
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:25,418
Relation? 
I didn't get you.

676
01:11:25,895 --> 01:11:32,232
You had married an Indian journalist. 
You also have a daughter.

677
01:11:32,902 --> 01:11:38,431
Our readers are mostly Indian.
They'll like to know about your wife.

678
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:43,572
This is very personal.
You can't ask me that.

679
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:50,946
At least tell us why didn't you get married again?

680
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:57,118
No. And now I am beyond the age of getting married.

681
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:05,265
Papa. I know that you do not want to be disturbed.

682
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:06,460
But there is an important call for you..

683
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:07,866
..from the British High Commission.

684
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:09,063
Ok darling.

685
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:11,197
Hi. - Excuse me, Mr. Prem.
- Thank you very much.

686
01:12:11,273 --> 01:12:16,210
I will be back. - Miss..
- Yes. - Excuse me. please.

687
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,008
I've toured the entire world.

688
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:29,013
Taken lots of snaps. 
But I've never seen a perfect face like yours..

689
01:12:29,091 --> 01:12:31,992
Journalists speak the truth very rarely.

690
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:37,326
- I can also swear by my profession.
- Then I will believe you.

691
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,334
I wish to take a snap of yours.

692
01:12:39,402 --> 01:12:41,233
No photographs, sorry. 
- please.

693
01:13:03,325 --> 01:13:05,054
Give me the roll.

694
01:14:12,394 --> 01:14:15,454
Wow! 
How did you get these snaps?

695
01:14:15,531 --> 01:14:18,398
You gave the rolls to the security officer in front of me.

696
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:22,304
But the original rolls are with me.

697
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,099
Anyway, these are nice.

698
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:28,871
Especially this one.

699
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:31,936
O you like this!

700
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:36,148
AIright..I'll get these printed a else with your story.

701
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:40,086
My story? 
I didn't tell you my story.

702
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:41,885
So, tell it.

703
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:43,015
Why?

704
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:44,889
An interview.

705
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:47,886
My father will kill me.

706
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:52,498
After this story you will surely become immortal.

707
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:54,962
You'll surely be immortal after this story.

708
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:58,097
You are right, sure.

709
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:16,343
My heart is someone else's.

710
01:16:16,418 --> 01:16:21,515
Maybe this is called love.

711
01:16:21,857 --> 01:16:25,918
Why am I so restless?

712
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:31,126
Maybe this is called love.

713
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:35,534
My heart is someone else's.

714
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:40,934
Maybe this is called love.

715
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:45,276
Why am I so restless?

716
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:50,478
Maybe this is called love.

717
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:56,314
My heart is someone else's.

718
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:34,522
I was lost in one meeting.

719
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:39,527
The affair increased in a short time.

720
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:44,328
I was lost in one meeting.

721
01:17:44,406 --> 01:17:49,207
The affair increased in a short time.

722
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:54,341
I did not realize when our eyes met.

723
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:59,012
Wonder what effect it has on my heart.

724
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:03,889
My life has changed.

725
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:09,022
Maybe this is called love.

726
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:13,831
My heart is someone else's.

727
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:18,965
My heart is someone else's.

728
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:23,375
Maybe this is called love.

729
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:28,306
My heart is someone else's.

730
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:33,845
Maybe this is called love.
My heart is someone else's.

731
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:40,521
My heart is someone else's.

732
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:45,299
Driver, let's go.

733
01:18:47,302 --> 01:18:51,068
I can't allow you to marry an Indian.

734
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,973
Indians are deceivers, liars and frauds.

735
01:18:54,043 --> 01:19:00,471
I can't let you ruin your life. Never!

736
01:19:00,883 --> 01:19:04,944
Why do you hate Indians? 
After all my mother was an Indian.

737
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:09,218
If they are so bad, then,
why did you marry her?

738
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:11,225
I can't tell you that.

739
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:17,559
But I want to know the secret which you've kept hidden from me.

740
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:22,030
I didn't tell you for I wanted to see you happy.

741
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:25,301
I wanted to bring you up like a normal child.

742
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:28,969
I didn't want to burden you with all these things.

743
01:19:30,913 --> 01:19:37,580
I'm no more a child. 
I should know what my Indian mother's fault is.

744
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:43,585
all right. 
I'll tell you everything.

745
01:19:43,926 --> 01:19:46,258
Then you can decide.

746
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:52,994
I met your mother when I was an ambassador for India.

747
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:55,263
She was a journalist.

748
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:57,396
She lived in Malaga.

749
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:01,200
We celebrated our honeymoon in Malaga.

750
01:20:01,276 --> 01:20:04,211
Then, she came to Vienna with me.

751
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:10,149
But suddenly one day she said she wanted to return to Malaga.

752
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:14,550
She left a year old baby and me.

753
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:16,949
I.. I called her up. 
I had even written to her.

754
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:20,427
But she never agreed to return.

755
01:20:20,896 --> 01:20:24,161
I may be a culprit.

756
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:27,234
But a small child,
what was her fault?

757
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:31,900
Why did she punish you?
I don't know.

758
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:36,235
I've brought you up since you were a child.

759
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:38,438
If I've no right over you then it's alright.

760
01:20:38,914 --> 01:20:40,313
But I want to tell you something.

761
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:46,446
When your mother left me you were my hope to live.

762
01:20:46,922 --> 01:20:52,258
And now if you leave me I'll have no reason to live.

763
01:21:07,943 --> 01:21:10,207
I want to marry Sonia.

764
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:15,080
How dare you? 
You.. You Indian.

765
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,017
Sir your daughter loves this Indian.

766
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:23,285
I thought you were a decent man, so I called you here.

767
01:21:23,358 --> 01:21:24,882
But you..

768
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,019
My decency has been degraded only..

769
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,155
.. because I want to marry your daughter.

770
01:21:30,299 --> 01:21:34,099
No, no way that my daughter will ever marry you. Yes!

771
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:36,034
She will never marry you.

772
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:41,101
If you don't mind, I'll like to hear it from Sonia.

773
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:48,178
Caroline, send Sonia in.

774
01:22:17,412 --> 01:22:25,547
I love you Prem but.. but my father..
he needs me.

775
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:31,348
My mom had left him.
She never returned.

776
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:35,362
He has no one except me.

777
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:38,490
Why didn't you think of it earlier?

778
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:43,296
What right do you have to break my heart?

779
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:46,902
Give me a reply.

780
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:48,840
Why did you come into my life?

781
01:22:49,911 --> 01:22:51,242
I was living well.

782
01:22:51,313 --> 01:22:53,372
Why did you come into my life?

783
01:22:54,283 --> 01:22:55,841
Why?

784
01:22:55,917 --> 01:22:57,111
Are you listening to me?

785
01:22:57,185 --> 01:22:59,119
Do you hear me?

786
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:43,956
Tony!

787
01:23:47,836 --> 01:23:50,100
I said, I will not have food.

788
01:23:50,172 --> 01:23:56,839
Tony! Hi!

789
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:03,509
Ah! Ma'am, I thought you must have already left.

790
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:07,913
I was about to leave but someone stopped me.

791
01:24:07,989 --> 01:24:11,390
- I know who stopped you. 
- Who?

792
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,919
Your inner conscience stopped you.

793
01:24:13,995 --> 01:24:21,060
It told you, Stop! 
Don't go..

794
01:24:21,136 --> 01:24:28,065
.. whatever you'll find here,
you won't find anywhere. Right?

795
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:34,979
Yes. only once you can love someone truly. 
So, don't lose it.

796
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:39,284
Yes, Madam. You are right!
Congratulations, Tony!

797
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:42,482
Congratulations! 
Madam is not leaving you and going anywhere.

798
01:24:42,557 --> 01:24:44,286
God has answered your prayers.

799
01:24:44,426 --> 01:24:48,226
Tony, this article..

800
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:52,357
I don't know. You see, even my photo is printed in renowned newspaper.

801
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:58,033
Prem.. 
- He is Prem Arya, my close pal.

802
01:24:58,106 --> 01:24:59,835
Where does he live?

803
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,034
He doesn't live here. 
But he keeps on coming here.

804
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,374
But Madam, you must meet him once.
He is a wonderful man!

805
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:07,108
He writes exceIIent articles. 
tell him about your life..

806
01:25:07,182 --> 01:25:08,240
Can you introduce me to him?

807
01:25:08,316 --> 01:25:13,948
Why not? 
Think your job is done.

808
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:23,523
Prem brother! - Hey Tony! -
Brother Prem! - How are you?

809
01:25:23,865 --> 01:25:26,527
Today I want to talk to you openly!
- Tony, what are you doing?

810
01:25:26,868 --> 01:25:28,267
Give me your hand.

811
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:33,535
- Which one? 
- Your right hand. What a fortune!

812
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:36,935
A man like Tony will take birth and die unnoticed.

813
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:39,947
But the day I saw this hand,
my luck has changed.

814
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:42,548
Whoever reads this article..
they go crazy!

815
01:25:42,884 --> 01:25:46,149
I wrote this article 8 months back.

816
01:25:46,221 --> 01:25:47,882
And you've already thanked me 16 times. 
What's so important?

817
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:53,360
It's a special day today. 
Madam had come to my house today.

818
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:54,887
Who?

819
01:25:54,963 --> 01:26:00,026
Madam! She's a beauty. 
You won't find such a beauty anywhere.

820
01:26:00,168 --> 01:26:05,834
She came to my house and read your article.

821
01:26:05,974 --> 01:26:10,502
I had hung your article on the wall.

822
01:26:10,846 --> 01:26:12,905
She liked the article.

823
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:18,851
I told her I'll introduce her to the person who wrote it. 
No big deal!

824
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,114
What's her name?

825
01:26:21,857 --> 01:26:26,191
Strange! 
I didn't ask her name.

826
01:26:26,328 --> 01:26:28,922
No problem. 
What's in a name?

827
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:32,057
A rose will aIways remain rose, even if you change its name.

828
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:34,192
Good! 
You are praising her so much.

829
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:37,534
It means you are in love. 
Isn't it?

830
01:26:42,878 --> 01:26:46,405
I'm not of her standard.

831
01:26:46,882 --> 01:26:54,220
She is very rich I can admire her but not possess her.

832
01:26:54,289 --> 01:26:56,223
Very well said. 
Very well said.

833
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:59,488
Come to the restaurant.

834
01:26:59,828 --> 01:27:04,492
She was praising you so much that I told her I'll introduce you to her.

835
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:07,825
please meet her. 
I'll be honoured.

836
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:09,962
For my sake. 
- Okay, okay.

837
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:14,168
Today at 4.30 p.m.

838
01:27:17,379 --> 01:27:19,108
Hey Tony, one minute.

839
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,512
Speak up Ma'am. Good things shouldn't be kept to heart.

840
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:22,908
Or else, it's not good.

841
01:27:22,984 --> 01:27:24,042
Here..

842
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:29,849
What's this? - Keep it.
 - No, I won't accept fees from you.

843
01:27:29,991 --> 01:27:34,928
One earns for living, but sometimes I do listen to my heart.

844
01:27:34,996 --> 01:27:36,861
But this is not the fees.

845
01:27:36,932 --> 01:27:37,990
Then, what is it?

846
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:41,193
You pay the hotel bill.

847
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:44,534
Come on. 
- Okay, cool. I got it.

848
01:27:44,873 --> 01:27:47,808
A lady should not pay when accompanied by a man. Right?

849
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:51,004
Okay, let's move. 
- Let's go.

850
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:14,860
Hey Tony! 
- Hi, Prem! Hi!

851
01:28:14,936 --> 01:28:19,600
How are you? - Happening, man! 
- You are happening.

852
01:28:33,088 --> 01:28:35,556
Mr. Prem, stunned aren't you?

853
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:38,218
You wouldn't have expected to meet such a person.

854
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,892
My Madam is beautiful, isn't she?

855
01:28:40,962 --> 01:28:45,899
Madam, this is Mr. Prem and Mr. Prem this is Madam.

856
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:52,030
Hi Prem. 
- How are you Sonia?

857
01:28:54,576 --> 01:28:55,634
alive.

858
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:59,771
How do you know her?

859
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:04,910
A journallst coming from Vienna had told me.

860
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:11,718
Excuse me, I'll place the order.

861
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:14,658
His suit is giving me a complex.

862
01:29:16,598 --> 01:29:18,657
How did you land here?

863
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:21,261
Perhaps to meet you.

864
01:29:22,871 --> 01:29:27,274
You have come alone.
- Nanny is with me.

865
01:29:27,609 --> 01:29:29,668
Papa's not here.

866
01:29:36,685 --> 01:29:38,949
I've not married as yet.

867
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:42,681
I didn't ask you that.

868
01:29:44,025 --> 01:29:46,084
You were watching my hands. 
I thought, you were looking..

869
01:29:46,161 --> 01:29:48,755
.. out for the wedding ring.

870
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,664
How are you?

871
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:56,833
Fine and happy too.

872
01:29:57,839 --> 01:29:59,636
Are you angry?

873
01:30:00,909 --> 01:30:02,570
Not at all.

874
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:10,244
We couldn't get married, but atleast we can be friends.

875
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:13,247
We were and will remain friends.

876
01:30:15,924 --> 01:30:24,263
You know my helplessness. 
I have not changed. I still love you.

877
01:30:25,867 --> 01:30:30,998
Now this is of no use.

878
01:30:31,072 --> 01:30:33,597
Prem please try to understand.

879
01:30:36,077 --> 01:30:37,601
please.

880
01:30:47,088 --> 01:30:51,218
I've placed the order.
Where's Mr. Prem?

881
01:30:51,826 --> 01:30:54,954
He has left. We will also leave. 
- Leave?

882
01:31:02,837 --> 01:31:03,895
Hey Joe! 
Forget it.

883
01:31:06,674 --> 01:31:08,574
Wonder what happened?

884
01:31:08,643 --> 01:31:12,977
The meeting got over in one minute.
Madam forgot her money with me.

885
01:31:14,015 --> 01:31:20,250
God always gives me a chance to come across her.

886
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:37,603
What is the matter?

887
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:40,098
You went to meet Prem? 
- Yes.

888
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:45,272
You shouldn't have gone. - Nanny.

889
01:31:45,613 --> 01:31:50,209
I realized it after meeting him that I love him very much.

890
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:55,756
I can't Iive without him. Never!

891
01:31:55,824 --> 01:31:57,553
Forget him.

892
01:31:57,826 --> 01:32:01,956
How? I can't forget him.

893
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:05,830
You deserve a better guy than him.

894
01:32:05,967 --> 01:32:07,901
What is she talking?

895
01:32:08,036 --> 01:32:10,231
Marry someone of your status.

896
01:32:10,572 --> 01:32:15,100
Status! He's poor, that's his crime? 
I love him.

897
01:32:15,577 --> 01:32:20,708
He gave me the happiness which even my father couldn't give me.

898
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:26,848
Whatever it is, I love him.

899
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:34,657
I too love you a lot. 
- Think about it, Sonia. I heard it, it's okay.

900
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:37,264
But what if anyone else would've heard it? 
there would be a problem.

901
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:39,658
Now nothing can stop me.

902
01:32:39,734 --> 01:32:42,259
I'll love him till my last breath.

903
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:46,873
And I'll only love you!

904
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:09,881
If you say, I'll kiss you..

905
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:13,553
..in this lovely weather.

906
01:34:13,628 --> 01:34:17,223
If you say, I'll kiss you..

907
01:34:17,565 --> 01:34:19,829
..in this lovely weather.

908
01:34:19,901 --> 01:34:24,702
The heart says..

909
01:34:24,772 --> 01:34:27,969
..my beloved..

910
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:33,571
..I should cross all limits in love.

911
01:34:33,648 --> 01:34:36,913
If you say, I'll go round..

912
01:34:36,985 --> 01:34:40,853
..in your passion.

913
01:34:40,922 --> 01:34:47,794
If you say, I'll go round in your passion.

914
01:34:47,862 --> 01:34:51,593
The heart says..

915
01:34:51,666 --> 01:35:00,540
..my beloved, I should cross all limits in love.

916
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:07,207
If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

917
01:35:07,548 --> 01:35:14,886
If you say, I'll go round in your passion.

918
01:35:33,641 --> 01:35:41,707
From your tresses,
I'll steaI your fragrance.

919
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:48,586
I'll steaI the loveliness from your lips.

920
01:35:48,656 --> 01:35:57,792
Stop it, I am feeling shy.
- Why do you feel shy?

921
01:35:57,865 --> 01:36:06,204
Why do you fear?
Nothing is in our control.

922
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:13,879
If you say, I'll go round in your passion.

923
01:36:13,948 --> 01:36:21,150
If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

924
01:36:48,783 --> 01:36:56,519
My eyes keep watching you all the time.

925
01:36:56,591 --> 01:37:03,190
These fair arms just wish for you.

926
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:10,061
I cannot Iive being separated from you.

927
01:37:10,138 --> 01:37:12,868
In these eyes..

928
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:16,671
..I have dreams..

929
01:37:16,744 --> 01:37:21,681
..and I am waiting for you.

930
01:37:21,749 --> 01:37:28,552
If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

931
01:37:28,623 --> 01:37:35,995
If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

932
01:37:36,063 --> 01:37:43,231
The heart says..

933
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:48,634
..my beloved, I should cross all limits in love.

934
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:55,581
If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

935
01:37:55,650 --> 01:38:03,113
If you say, I'll go round in your passion.

936
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:45,828
Hello. 
- Hi Prem! - Sonia!

937
01:38:47,568 --> 01:38:49,627
How did you get this number?

938
01:38:50,004 --> 01:38:51,562
From Tony.

939
01:38:51,639 --> 01:38:58,101
Good you called me up. 
I was thinking about you the whole night.

940
01:38:59,647 --> 01:39:05,051
I was sorry for yesterday's behaviour.

941
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:07,246
I should not have said that.

942
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:14,653
Whatever you said was right.

943
01:39:14,729 --> 01:39:17,994
I've no right to step into your life again.

944
01:39:18,065 --> 01:39:19,794
My life?

945
01:39:20,868 --> 01:39:22,927
My life doesn't remain mine anymore.

946
01:39:23,004 --> 01:39:27,065
I never imagined, our attempt in order to make Papa happy..

947
01:39:27,141 --> 01:39:31,271
.. would drift us far apart.

948
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:34,939
Prem.

949
01:39:36,884 --> 01:39:38,943
I'm leaving tomorrow.

950
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,681
Don't go, Sonia.

951
01:39:40,955 --> 01:39:42,013
Prem, I..

952
01:39:42,089 --> 01:39:43,613
please.

953
01:39:43,691 --> 01:39:47,752
But till now..

954
01:39:47,828 --> 01:39:50,888
Until it's possible, please.

955
01:39:51,565 --> 01:39:57,003
Ok. I love you Sonia.. 
- Me too Prem.

956
01:40:02,576 --> 01:40:06,842
So we will have to unpack? 
- Yes.

957
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:14,047
If you get the time then think about it that if your father comes to know..

958
01:40:14,121 --> 01:40:16,055
What he will think.

959
01:40:36,677 --> 01:40:39,271
This is the limit, Madam!
You went without informing me.

960
01:40:39,613 --> 01:40:41,672
I'm waiting for you since morning.

961
01:40:41,749 --> 01:40:43,011
I wasted 8 liters petrol for you.

962
01:40:43,617 --> 01:40:45,881
I was about to go to the police station.

963
01:40:46,954 --> 01:40:49,218
You should've left a message at the desk.

964
01:40:50,091 --> 01:40:52,218
I was so worried, you know.

965
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,222
I'm sorry.

966
01:40:55,563 --> 01:40:57,622
Now don't embarrass me. 
I've no right to talk to you like this.

967
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:05,572
You are so beautiful. 
You can even turn a gentleman into a rogue.

968
01:41:06,574 --> 01:41:11,238
I'll do everything with your permission in future. 
Okay?

969
01:41:11,579 --> 01:41:14,639
Tomorrow I've to go to Paradise island. 
Prem has called me.

970
01:41:14,715 --> 01:41:15,773
You can go.

971
01:41:15,916 --> 01:41:19,977
Won't you come?
- If you wish, I'll come.

972
01:41:20,054 --> 01:41:22,921
all right, tomorrow we'll go.

973
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:25,720
Come, I'll drop you.

974
01:41:25,793 --> 01:41:27,590
You don't like my like?

975
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:38,266
Good I found you. I've bought a dress. 
How do I look?

976
01:41:44,612 --> 01:41:47,604
- How much did it cost?
- Nine hundred rupees. Why?

977
01:41:48,816 --> 01:41:51,614
It's too much. Seems to be new.

978
01:41:51,685 --> 01:41:53,880
No jokes. Tony, tell me, how do I look?

979
01:41:53,954 --> 01:41:55,546
I told you, the dress seems to be new.

980
01:41:55,623 --> 01:42:00,754
It's new. Listen.. 
I'll wear this for the party in Paradise island.

981
01:42:00,828 --> 01:42:01,886
We'll go together.

982
01:42:01,962 --> 01:42:06,228
- I can't go with you there. 
- Why?

983
01:42:06,567 --> 01:42:11,971
Because I'll have to take my tourist around. 
Work, you see, baby.

984
01:42:12,039 --> 01:42:13,563
Tourists..? 
Or that Madam.

985
01:42:13,641 --> 01:42:15,905
She is also one of my tourist.

986
01:42:15,976 --> 01:42:21,642
Look Neena, Madam is my work and my work is my worship.

987
01:42:26,587 --> 01:42:27,918
Hi Tony.

988
01:42:27,988 --> 01:42:29,717
Hi buddy how are you?

989
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:33,851
Hey! How are you? - Hi - Hi. 
- Hello. - It's okay, see you bye.

990
01:42:33,928 --> 01:42:36,658
How are you Mr. Gonzalves?

991
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:37,788
How are you doing? - I am fine.
- He is a big shot. Big shot.

992
01:42:37,865 --> 01:42:41,266
Hi Rodriquez. 
He is the commissioner. See..

993
01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:43,661
This is Prem.

994
01:42:43,737 --> 01:42:47,798
What are you doing here?

995
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:49,638
Tony boy, how are you? 
- How are you doing?

996
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:51,200
You are looking handsome.
Very handsome.

997
01:42:51,545 --> 01:42:54,605
Tony, mind your language or else you'll repent.

998
01:42:54,682 --> 01:42:56,547
You are the worst person here.

999
01:42:56,617 --> 01:42:57,675
Move on!

1000
01:42:57,751 --> 01:43:00,015
Take it easy. Relax. 
- What man, this is very bad.

1001
01:43:00,087 --> 01:43:02,021
Neena, this is Sonia.
Neena. - Hi Neena. - Hello.

1002
01:43:02,089 --> 01:43:04,216
You always insult me during parties.

1003
01:43:04,558 --> 01:43:06,617
Let's dance, please.

1004
01:43:06,694 --> 01:43:07,752
Silly girl! 
Who the hell will dance with you?

1005
01:43:07,828 --> 01:43:08,886
Who will get insulted in the party?

1006
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:10,021
You always raise your hands at the wrong place!

1007
01:43:10,097 --> 01:43:11,689
Tony please do it.

1008
01:43:11,765 --> 01:43:16,828
You! Oh you! I can dance at your finger tips.

1009
01:43:16,904 --> 01:43:18,565
I will come in one minute.

1010
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:21,699
As it is I've to dance at your finger tips for the whole life.

1011
01:43:38,025 --> 01:43:46,091
Haiya Ho! 
Haiya Ho!

1012
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:50,603
Haiya Ho!

1013
01:43:50,671 --> 01:43:55,734
Haiya Ho!

1014
01:43:55,809 --> 01:44:00,212
Haiya Ho! 
What fun! What magic!

1015
01:44:00,548 --> 01:44:05,212
Me and you! 
What fun! What magic!

1016
01:44:05,553 --> 01:44:10,217
Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love.

1017
01:44:10,558 --> 01:44:14,892
Let's talk about our love with our eyes.

1018
01:44:14,962 --> 01:44:19,092
Haiya Ho! 
What fun! What magic!

1019
01:44:19,567 --> 01:44:23,765
Me and you! 
What fun! What magic!

1020
01:44:23,837 --> 01:44:28,001
Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love.

1021
01:44:28,075 --> 01:44:32,910
Let's talk about our love with our eyes.

1022
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:38,919
Haiya Ho! What fun!
What magic! What magic!

1023
01:45:04,878 --> 01:45:09,611
Your eyes are amazing!

1024
01:45:09,683 --> 01:45:14,211
Your blue eyes are beautiful!

1025
01:45:14,555 --> 01:45:18,548
A face like yours is not to be seen here.

1026
01:45:18,626 --> 01:45:24,565
Such beautiful hair is not to be seen here.

1027
01:45:24,632 --> 01:45:31,902
You are fanatical! alone!
There is no one like anywhere.

1028
01:45:31,972 --> 01:45:36,568
Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic!

1029
01:45:36,644 --> 01:45:41,775
Me and you! What fun! What magic!

1030
01:45:41,849 --> 01:45:45,910
Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love.

1031
01:45:45,986 --> 01:45:52,186
Let's talk about our love with our eyes.

1032
01:45:52,526 --> 01:45:55,927
Haiya Ho! What fun!
What magic! What magic!

1033
01:46:17,651 --> 01:46:22,714
What is my story! Listen!

1034
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:27,022
I am heart broken! Listen!

1035
01:46:27,094 --> 01:46:31,656
Whom should I tell this thing to?

1036
01:46:31,732 --> 01:46:37,637
Whom should I show my pain to? 
- These wounds..

1037
01:46:37,705 --> 01:46:45,840
..those moments, we will never think of them again.

1038
01:46:45,913 --> 01:46:54,184
Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic!
Me and you! What fun! What magic!

1039
01:46:54,521 --> 01:46:58,787
Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love.

1040
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:03,193
Let's talk about our love with our eyes.

1041
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:09,196
Haiya Ho! What fun!
What magic! What magic!

1042
01:47:17,077 --> 01:47:21,537
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1043
01:47:21,615 --> 01:47:26,678
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1044
01:47:26,754 --> 01:47:30,815
I am crazy about you, my beloved.

1045
01:47:30,891 --> 01:47:35,225
You are my story, my beloved.

1046
01:47:35,562 --> 01:47:40,090
I have always thought about you, I swear.

1047
01:47:40,167 --> 01:47:45,571
I have always loved you, I swear.

1048
01:47:45,639 --> 01:47:51,771
In my heart, there is aspiration only for you.

1049
01:47:51,845 --> 01:47:53,779
There is no one like you anywhere.

1050
01:47:53,847 --> 01:47:58,181
Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic!

1051
01:47:58,519 --> 01:48:02,922
Me and you! What fun! What magic!

1052
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:07,188
Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love.

1053
01:48:07,528 --> 01:48:12,659
Let's talk about our love with our eyes.

1054
01:48:12,733 --> 01:48:16,533
Haiya Ho! - What fun!
What magic! What magic!

1055
01:48:16,603 --> 01:48:22,200
Me and you! 
- What fun! What magic!

1056
01:48:22,543 --> 01:48:24,602
What are you doing?

1057
01:48:24,678 --> 01:48:26,543
What are you doing? 
Listen.

1058
01:48:26,613 --> 01:48:27,671
How wonderful you look!

1059
01:48:27,748 --> 01:48:31,946
I'm serious. 
I'll write an article on Neena.

1060
01:48:32,286 --> 01:48:34,948
Sonia, you know.. 
she's an amazing girl.

1061
01:48:35,289 --> 01:48:40,727
She is self reliant at such a small age. 
She manages all alone.

1062
01:48:40,794 --> 01:48:44,560
Isn't it wonderful?
- As it is she's crazy.

1063
01:48:44,631 --> 01:48:46,690
God knows what'll happen after her article is published.

1064
01:48:46,767 --> 01:48:48,962
Tony! 
- Here she starts!

1065
01:48:49,736 --> 01:48:50,794
Here we go again. 
- Start.

1066
01:48:51,305 --> 01:48:56,368
Those who don't have anyone's support have to be self-reliant.

1067
01:48:56,443 --> 01:49:00,971
Don't you have anyone? 
Parents, brothers, sisters..?

1068
01:49:01,782 --> 01:49:11,851
Tony is my neighbour and my friend too. 
And.. and..

1069
01:49:12,326 --> 01:49:16,592
He's my only childhood friend.
He's my support.

1070
01:49:16,663 --> 01:49:20,531
What else could I do, Madam?
I too am an orphan like her.

1071
01:49:20,601 --> 01:49:22,728
So I can understand her grief.

1072
01:49:22,803 --> 01:49:28,537
I had seen a play when I was a kid.
It's dialogues touched my heart.

1073
01:49:29,776 --> 01:49:32,438
Loneliness supports loneliness.

1074
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:38,676
We kept on supporting each other and have come a else way.

1075
01:49:38,752 --> 01:49:40,344
Now let's see where destiny takes us.

1076
01:49:41,355 --> 01:49:43,482
I am very impressed, seriously.

1077
01:49:43,557 --> 01:49:45,491
But nowadays I'm tensed.

1078
01:49:45,559 --> 01:49:46,617
Why?

1079
01:49:46,693 --> 01:49:49,423
She is young and above all she is beautiful.

1080
01:49:49,563 --> 01:49:53,499
I'm thinking of getting her married off.

1081
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:06,308
Did you see brother Prem? 
Did you see?

1082
01:50:07,314 --> 01:50:10,442
I can understand the whole world but not her.

1083
01:50:10,517 --> 01:50:12,576
Just a minute, I'll be back.

1084
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,584
Hey you basket of flower!

1085
01:50:15,756 --> 01:50:17,986
Hey my beauty! My fenny!

1086
01:50:24,331 --> 01:50:26,390
Did you notice something?

1087
01:50:27,334 --> 01:50:34,536
Yes, I did. 
The girl loves him and the guy does not understand.

1088
01:50:36,343 --> 01:50:42,407
Why does it happen? 
Why is there a problem in every love story?

1089
01:50:43,617 --> 01:50:49,283
Perhaps God is testing us. 
Whether the love is true or not.

1090
01:50:51,758 --> 01:50:54,420
What about those who pass the test?

1091
01:50:58,298 --> 01:50:59,765
They unite.

1092
01:51:05,305 --> 01:51:09,503
- But Madam..
- We enjoyed, didn't we?

1093
01:51:09,576 --> 01:51:11,305
Of course Ma'am.

1094
01:51:11,378 --> 01:51:13,573
Thank you Tony.

1095
01:51:13,647 --> 01:51:15,706
I feel proud of myself today.
No doubt, I am a guide.

1096
01:51:15,782 --> 01:51:23,985
I never got to see so much till today. 
I'm sorry. I'll leave.

1097
01:51:24,324 --> 01:51:26,383
- What is it? 
- I want to say something.

1098
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:29,395
Go on. 
- Now what will she say in this closed room?!

1099
01:51:35,869 --> 01:51:40,772
Sit.

1100
01:51:40,841 --> 01:51:42,433
My chair will get wet!

1101
01:51:42,509 --> 01:51:44,670
No problem, I'll sit.

1102
01:52:11,304 --> 01:52:18,972
Have you ever been in love?

1103
01:52:32,392 --> 01:52:35,793
My friends have been.

1104
01:52:37,798 --> 01:52:42,861
But now it seems, it's my turn.

1105
01:52:44,337 --> 01:52:52,335
I know. 
Do you know, how one feels when in love?

1106
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,681
Yes, I know, I'm getting it..

1107
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:07,418
How will you come to know that a girl is in love?

1108
01:53:09,296 --> 01:53:10,729
I'll come to know.

1109
01:53:12,766 --> 01:53:17,567
Then, go ahead, find out.

1110
01:53:19,739 --> 01:53:22,435
A girl.. in love.

1111
01:53:30,317 --> 01:53:32,751
I'll keep it as a secret.

1112
01:53:32,819 --> 01:53:35,310
But tell the girl at least.

1113
01:53:35,388 --> 01:53:37,322
What?

1114
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:39,324
I love you.

1115
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:46,390
- Shall I..? - Yes

1116
01:53:51,538 --> 01:53:57,602
- Sure! Shall I tell her? 
- Go on.. - I'm feeling shy.

1117
01:53:57,677 --> 01:54:01,340
It's very simple, Tony. I love you.

1118
01:54:10,724 --> 01:54:13,284
The thing is I have never said it to anyone.

1119
01:54:14,728 --> 01:54:16,423
I will say it.

1120
01:54:18,832 --> 01:54:26,568
I.. love.. you.

1121
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:36,510
Yes! Yes, Tony! 
That's it!

1122
01:54:40,754 --> 01:54:42,415
You've said it.

1123
01:54:43,757 --> 01:54:45,315
Madam? 
- Yes.

1124
01:54:49,529 --> 01:54:51,326
Shall I leave?

1125
01:54:53,533 --> 01:54:55,262
Good night, Tony.

1126
01:54:56,703 --> 01:55:01,606
Goodnight. 
- Goodnight.

1127
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:10,340
Bye, bye. 
- Goodnight.

1128
01:55:51,258 --> 01:55:57,663
If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

1129
01:55:57,731 --> 01:56:01,599
If you say..

1130
01:56:01,668 --> 01:56:05,263
..I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

1131
01:56:05,338 --> 01:56:08,933
The heart says..

1132
01:56:09,276 --> 01:56:12,268
..my beloved..

1133
01:56:12,345 --> 01:56:17,749
..I should cross all limits in love.

1134
01:56:27,294 --> 01:56:29,558
A glass for him, this is mine.

1135
01:56:32,832 --> 01:56:35,562
Hey! Neena! 
- Tony!

1136
01:56:37,304 --> 01:56:42,970
You are enjoying all alone.
There is a candle, and a castle.

1137
01:56:44,311 --> 01:56:48,645
For whom is the other glass?

1138
01:56:48,715 --> 01:56:50,774
For the one whom I love!

1139
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:53,310
Who is that unfortunate guy?

1140
01:56:53,386 --> 01:56:55,513
Hey, mind you! 
Don't you bad-mouth him.

1141
01:56:55,588 --> 01:56:57,852
- Are you serious?
 - Of course, yes.

1142
01:56:58,258 --> 01:57:00,590
- You love him very much?
- Yes, a lot.

1143
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,594
Did you tell him, I love you

1144
01:57:04,597 --> 01:57:09,261
You should express your
love from the very start.

1145
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:15,333
Whenever you propose someone for the first time in life..

1146
01:57:15,408 --> 01:57:20,471
.. you know you feel as if you've consumed a bottle of sweet wine..

1147
01:57:20,547 --> 01:57:25,610
.. which also gives you a high.

1148
01:57:26,386 --> 01:57:29,480
Yes, it does happen in love.

1149
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:34,692
I just can't believe! 
The way she said, I love you

1150
01:57:36,296 --> 01:57:44,567
- She? - Who? 
- Madam, who else?

1151
01:57:44,637 --> 01:57:47,299
I was thinking that only I loved her.

1152
01:57:47,374 --> 01:57:49,433
But today I realised that she also loves me.

1153
01:57:49,509 --> 01:57:51,340
The feeling of love is as such.

1154
01:57:57,450 --> 01:58:03,355
Yes Tony, this fire is such that it burns everything.

1155
01:58:03,423 --> 01:58:09,919
Some express it whereas some are just helpless.

1156
01:58:10,263 --> 01:58:12,595
You are quite intelligent!

1157
01:58:12,665 --> 01:58:17,364
Come on cheers! 
Cheers to Sonia! Hey! Have it!

1158
01:58:18,538 --> 01:58:20,267
Why don't you have it?

1159
01:58:21,274 --> 01:58:26,803
Actually my companion is drifting away from me.

1160
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,748
Is he? No problem. 
He'll be on the track again.

1161
01:58:29,816 --> 01:58:31,283
If your love is true, may be after some time..

1162
01:58:31,351 --> 01:58:33,683
.. but he will be yours.

1163
01:58:33,753 --> 01:58:35,550
Come on cheers! 
Cheers for Sonia!

1164
01:58:38,725 --> 01:58:42,957
Come on. Come on, cheers for your love, man!

1165
01:58:45,832 --> 01:58:47,390
Have it.

1166
01:58:57,744 --> 01:58:59,302
Hello.

1167
01:58:59,379 --> 01:59:03,315
Sonia, what are you doing?

1168
01:59:04,584 --> 01:59:06,643
I'm thinking, what I should do.

1169
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:07,777
Shall I help you?

1170
01:59:07,854 --> 01:59:09,321
please.

1171
01:59:09,756 --> 01:59:12,316
Spend your day with someone who spends sleepless nights..

1172
01:59:12,392 --> 01:59:14,519
.. thinking about you.

1173
01:59:14,594 --> 01:59:18,428
Good idea! But where do i find such a person.

1174
01:59:18,498 --> 01:59:20,329
I know him.

1175
01:59:21,334 --> 01:59:23,393
Really? 
What's his name?

1176
01:59:24,771 --> 01:59:26,329
Prem.

1177
01:59:29,342 --> 01:59:32,800
Wait for me on the beach.
I'll be coming.

1178
01:59:32,879 --> 01:59:35,006
Bye.

1179
01:59:37,617 --> 01:59:38,675
Yahoo, Sonia!

1180
01:59:41,354 --> 01:59:43,413
Papa, you!

1181
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:47,017
Yes, my baby! 
Are you not happy to see me?

1182
01:59:47,293 --> 01:59:49,761
No papa. 
I am very happy.

1183
01:59:51,297 --> 01:59:53,959
But all of a sudden..

1184
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:57,758
What a pleasant surprise!

1185
01:59:58,304 --> 02:00:01,762
My darling girl! 
I was missing you. So I came here.

1186
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:06,301
That's why I am here. 
How do you like Malaga? 
How do you like India?

1187
02:00:06,379 --> 02:00:11,783
Nice! The weather, the people..
just wonderfully warm.

1188
02:00:11,851 --> 02:00:15,309
Now I'm here for your company.
You will not be alone.

1189
02:00:15,388 --> 02:00:19,324
We will do everything together.

1190
02:00:28,334 --> 02:00:29,528
I will give her a flower.

1191
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:33,332
I'll give madam a flower. 
In exchange of that she will give me a kiss.

1192
02:00:33,406 --> 02:00:35,340
And in exchange of that I will give her a kiss.

1193
02:00:35,408 --> 02:00:38,002
I think she is having a bath.

1194
02:00:38,344 --> 02:00:43,008
Yes. - Yes.
- What can I do for you?

1195
02:00:43,349 --> 02:00:45,613
One masala tea, and 4 biscuits please.

1196
02:00:45,885 --> 02:00:47,352
No! No!

1197
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:50,287
Who are you and why you are here? 
- Why you are here?

1198
02:00:51,291 --> 02:00:53,953
Who are you? 
- I am me.

1199
02:00:54,294 --> 02:00:55,625
What the hell are you doing here?

1200
02:00:55,695 --> 02:00:56,753
Hell means hell?

1201
02:00:56,829 --> 02:00:58,694
He says he will hit me.

1202
02:00:58,765 --> 02:01:00,357
Who let you in here?

1203
02:01:00,433 --> 02:01:01,559
Have you gone crazy?

1204
02:01:01,634 --> 02:01:04,569
What? 
- Hey you fool!
This is too much!

1205
02:01:04,637 --> 02:01:08,403
What is this? 
- Hey you are going on talking because I am listening.

1206
02:01:08,474 --> 02:01:10,965
Idiot! 
Get out of here!

1207
02:01:11,311 --> 02:01:14,712
Quiet! Quiet! 
- What are you saying?

1208
02:01:14,781 --> 02:01:19,980
Hey you.. 
- No! I understand nothing.

1209
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,753
Are you mad?

1210
02:01:22,322 --> 02:01:26,520
You get out of here. 
I'll call the security guards now.

1211
02:01:26,593 --> 02:01:29,994
No one dare call Tony idiot here in Goa.

1212
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:32,264
You idiot! 
I don't care.

1213
02:01:32,332 --> 02:01:34,766
You get out of here or I will call the security guards.

1214
02:01:34,834 --> 02:01:38,395
Security guard! 
I'll give him a tenner and he'll disappear.

1215
02:01:38,471 --> 02:01:40,871
So you don't know, who am I.

1216
02:01:41,341 --> 02:01:43,400
- Who are you? 
- I'm Ambassador of Austria.

1217
02:01:43,476 --> 02:01:45,341
I'm the Mercedes of India.

1218
02:01:45,411 --> 02:01:48,209
Mercedes of India.
- Yes. - You idiot.

1219
02:01:48,281 --> 02:01:50,943

I'm not abusing you for you are elder to me.

1221
02:01:54,287 --> 02:01:55,720
You are exceeding your limits.

1222
02:01:55,788 --> 02:01:57,483
Then, what is this?

1223
02:01:57,557 --> 02:01:59,286
Don't you know, this is a piece of cucumber.

1224
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:01,623
Then what you want?

Where? - You go out from khidki 
What is a khidki?

1227
02:02:07,467 --> 02:02:10,300
Khidki means window.

1228
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:11,428
Stupid man!

1229
02:02:11,504 --> 02:02:13,563
Because you are elder you keep saying all this?

1230
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:15,301
- Yes, so what? -
Now I'll catch you.

1231
02:02:15,375 --> 02:02:17,309
- What will you do? 
- Surely, I'll catch you.

1232
02:02:17,377 --> 02:02:18,435
- Yes. 
- And after that..?

1233
02:02:18,511 --> 02:02:22,971
- I'll catch your nose.
- Don't touch me! - Why?

1234
02:02:23,316 --> 02:02:27,719
No body can touch Tony Gonsalves.
He is too much man.

1235
02:02:27,787 --> 02:02:30,449
I can also touch you. -
So, what's great?

1236
02:02:30,523 --> 02:02:33,253
What is that? 
I want you to get out now.

02:02:33,326 --> 02:02:35,988
Even I want you to get out now. 
- Where? - Out.

1238
02:02:36,329 --> 02:02:38,422
This is my place.
- This is my place.

1239
02:02:38,498 --> 02:02:40,989
What are you going to do? 
- So what are you going to do?

1240
02:02:41,334 --> 02:02:44,394
I am going to touch you.
Touch you, like this.

1241
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:47,462
Even I can touch you. 
Touch you.

1242
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:51,271
You are an Indian! 
You are not only an idiot but a swine.

1243
02:02:51,344 --> 02:02:54,802
I am not a swine. 
- I want you to be out of here.

1244
02:02:55,281 --> 02:02:57,340
Tony.. - I want you out of here. - No!
Yes. - I want you idiot out of here.

1245
02:02:57,417 --> 02:02:59,749
It's between two men. 
Ladies should not interfere.

1246
02:02:59,819 --> 02:03:01,286
Go and have a bath in the bathroom.

1247
02:03:01,354 --> 02:03:05,347
But Tony. - No. - Tony.
- Papa. - Papa.

1248
02:03:06,292 --> 02:03:07,554
Papa!

1249
02:03:08,728 --> 02:03:16,965
Papa, Tony.
- Yes. Papa. Sonia's papa.

1250
02:03:17,036 --> 02:03:19,732
Papa. - Papa. - Tony. - Tony.

1251
02:03:19,806 --> 02:03:21,296
He escorts me in Goa.
- Escorts in Goa.

1252
02:03:21,374 --> 02:03:23,308
He is always so happy.
- I am always so happy.

1253
02:03:23,376 --> 02:03:25,310
He is a gentleman.
- I am a gentleman, papa.

1254
02:03:26,579 --> 02:03:27,637
Papa. Forgive me.
- Security! Get him out from here.

1255
02:03:27,714 --> 02:03:28,772
Papa, he is apologizing.

1256
02:03:28,848 --> 02:03:31,578
Forgive me, papa. - He is sorry.
- You are mad. - Sorry.

1257
02:03:31,651 --> 02:03:33,710
But he is very sweet you know.

1258
02:03:33,786 --> 02:03:36,584
Papa, I am your Tony!
 - Sonia, get him out of here. 
- Papa, I love you.

1259
02:03:36,656 --> 02:03:37,714
please papa, I'll handle him.

1260
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:42,853
Security! 
- I'll handle him.
- No! I don't like him.

1261
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:46,330
Papa, don't worry,
I'll ask him to Ieave.

1262
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:54,704
Tony! - Idiot! Get out! - Papa! Papa!
- Papa! Get the hell out of here!

1263
02:04:06,285 --> 02:04:09,550
Ya.. 
- May I speak to Sonia please?

1264
02:04:09,622 --> 02:04:12,955
Who is calling? 
- Prem. - Prem.

1265
02:04:22,835 --> 02:04:27,704
So that's why you are here in India. 
I see.. Prem

1266
02:04:27,774 --> 02:04:30,971
No, I didn't come to India to meet Prem.

1267
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:33,505
I was here to see my mother's grave.

1268
02:04:33,846 --> 02:04:39,648
I didn't even know that Prem was here. 
I suddenly met him.

1269
02:04:39,719 --> 02:04:41,311
Sure I understand.

1270
02:04:41,454 --> 02:04:45,322
A girl sets off from Vienna to go to Singapore,..

1271
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:49,384
.. she gets down at Bombay.
Then, she goes to Malaga.

1272
02:04:49,462 --> 02:04:54,525
Where the population is around 3 Iakhs and out of all these people..

1273
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,194
..she meets the only one person whom sheshould not meet.

1274
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:58,931
You want me to believe this story.

1275
02:05:00,406 --> 02:05:01,532
You can ask nanny. 
This is true.

1276
02:05:01,607 --> 02:05:02,665
No, my dear.

1277
02:05:02,742 --> 02:05:05,609
Truth is, you told a lie to your father.

1278
02:05:05,678 --> 02:05:09,546
You came here to meet Prem. 
You didn't expect, I would come here.

1279
02:05:09,615 --> 02:05:11,947
And you were caught red-handed.

1280
02:05:12,285 --> 02:05:15,482
Papa, please believe me.
You know, I never lie.

1281
02:05:15,555 --> 02:05:22,688
You can Iie.. for an Indian blood flows through your veins.

1282
02:05:22,762 --> 02:05:25,492
Your mother too was a liar,
so what if you lie.

1283
02:05:25,565 --> 02:05:27,624
Papa. 
- Do not shout.

1284
02:05:29,836 --> 02:05:32,964
You did what you wished. 
Get ready.

1285
02:05:33,306 --> 02:05:35,501
We are going back to Vienna.

1286
02:05:53,526 --> 02:05:56,927
Prem.. 
- Sonia.. - That.

1287
02:05:57,263 --> 02:06:03,600
Sonia, no need to utter a word.
There is no need to explain anything.

1288
02:06:03,669 --> 02:06:09,938
I know this is not my story..
whose end I can write myself.

1289
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:14,375
For someone else has written my fate.

1290
02:06:14,447 --> 02:06:22,286
And there are only two pages of this story. 
The first and the last.

1291
02:06:24,290 --> 02:06:30,422
- Some stories are short.
- I can't explain..

1292
02:06:30,496 --> 02:06:34,398
I told you, there's no need to explain.

1293
02:06:35,735 --> 02:06:39,501
I know the end of my story.

1294
02:06:41,307 --> 02:06:43,366
I am sorry, Prem.

1295
02:06:48,381 --> 02:06:50,440
When are you going?

1296
02:06:50,516 --> 02:06:51,642
Day after tomorrow.

1297
02:06:55,655 --> 02:07:01,525
You can't but the time can stand still.

1298
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:10,330
Why are you getting so emotional?

1299
02:07:10,536 --> 02:07:16,805
You are a guide. 
people will enter your life and will leave.

1300
02:07:19,278 --> 02:07:25,342
people come and go in this city.
But not in the life of Tony guide.

1301
02:07:29,288 --> 02:07:32,815
I understand. I can understand your feelings.

1302
02:07:33,292 --> 02:07:35,726
But I cannot stay here.

1303
02:07:35,795 --> 02:07:39,731
And for how else?
One day I will have to go, isn't it?

1304
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:47,364
You are absolutely right, Madam.
You don't stay for me.

1305
02:07:49,709 --> 02:07:52,234
Once you leave...

1306
02:07:52,311 --> 02:07:54,905
.. I too will leave this city and go somewhere.

1307
02:07:57,249 --> 02:08:04,587
When you are gone, I'll miss you at everyplace in this city.

1308
02:08:07,259 --> 02:08:12,458
But I don't know, where will I go?

1309
02:08:18,337 --> 02:08:22,535
Tony. - What? 
- There's one place.

1310
02:08:22,608 --> 02:08:24,269
Where?

1311
02:08:24,343 --> 02:08:25,537
Vienna.

1312
02:08:27,613 --> 02:08:29,945
With you?!

1313
02:08:30,716 --> 02:08:33,344
- If you don't mind, can I ask you something. 
- Go on.

1314
02:08:35,287 --> 02:08:37,551
Who will explain it to your father?

1315
02:08:37,623 --> 02:08:39,488
I will do it.

1316
02:08:39,558 --> 02:08:40,684
Who is that?

1317
02:08:44,296 --> 02:08:46,355
Do you have a passport?

1318
02:08:46,432 --> 02:08:47,729
Yes. I had got it made to go to Dubai.

1319
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:49,961
- Leave it at the hotel tomorrow.
- I don't have a visa.

1320
02:08:50,302 --> 02:08:51,633
I'll take care of everything.

1321
02:08:51,704 --> 02:08:55,299
Madam, may I ask you something?
You were testing me, isn't it?

1322
02:08:55,374 --> 02:08:57,569
- No, Tony. 
- No.

1323
02:08:57,643 --> 02:09:01,739
Promise. - I promise.
- You were testing me.

1324
02:09:02,748 --> 02:09:08,812
Neena! Madam! Boom! Boom!

1325
02:09:16,495 --> 02:09:20,431
please prepare properly.

1326
02:09:20,499 --> 02:09:24,629
Take it.

1327
02:09:26,505 --> 02:09:31,636
I don't believe it. 
Is it a dream or a reality?

1328
02:09:31,977 --> 02:09:37,108
Look at me, I'm an ordinary guide while she's a princess.

1329
02:09:37,183 --> 02:09:42,246
One thing is for sure, Neena.
An astrologer had told me..

1330
02:09:42,321 --> 02:09:47,315
.. a princess will come in my life whom I'll love very much..

1331
02:09:47,393 --> 02:09:51,124
.. and she'll take me away with her.

1332
02:09:52,264 --> 02:09:54,391
Isn't it a wonderful fairy tale?!

1333
02:09:57,937 --> 02:10:07,141
You are crying! 
Get up... come on.

1334
02:10:07,213 --> 02:10:11,616
Sit.. you are an idiot.

1335
02:10:11,951 --> 02:10:14,613
You think I'll leave you here forget you?

1336
02:10:14,954 --> 02:10:17,013
Don't I know, after Madam..

1337
02:10:17,089 --> 02:10:19,614
.. only Neena loves me the most in the entire world.

1338
02:10:22,394 --> 02:10:28,629
On reaching there I'll tell Madam to arrange a nice job for me.

1339
02:10:28,968 --> 02:10:31,368
Then, I'll call you there.

1340
02:10:33,405 --> 02:10:37,637
Unless I tease you I can't digest my food.

1341
02:10:41,247 --> 02:10:46,082
I'm writing my house in your name and still you are crying.

1342
02:10:48,921 --> 02:10:53,984
Don't cry Neena..

1343
02:10:54,059 --> 02:11:00,464
.. when you cry something happens to me.

1344
02:11:02,268 --> 02:11:03,929
please.

1345
02:11:19,218 --> 02:11:22,051
I know Tony doesn't love me.

1346
02:11:22,121 --> 02:11:26,217
He hasn't even seen me properly.

1347
02:11:28,294 --> 02:11:36,360
Maybe because we don't care for the things which we possess.

1348
02:11:38,971 --> 02:11:45,069
And then, Sonia came in between us.

1349
02:11:47,179 --> 02:11:49,443
I'm not sad about this.

1350
02:11:51,116 --> 02:11:56,986
Because my happiness lies in his happiness.

1351
02:11:59,191 --> 02:12:07,997
Who else do I have except Tony?

1352
02:12:09,001 --> 02:12:13,062
I'm very happy today, Tony.

1353
02:12:16,141 --> 02:12:18,006
Sir, I sent the luggage.

1354
02:12:18,077 --> 02:12:21,376
But where's Sonia? 
The flight is at 12 o' cIock.

1355
02:12:21,447 --> 02:12:23,506
I will see.

1356
02:13:09,928 --> 02:13:14,991
How are you related to Jennifer?

1357
02:13:16,935 --> 02:13:18,061
She was my mother.

1358
02:13:18,137 --> 02:13:22,005
- So, you are Haynes daughter? 
- Yes.

1359
02:13:23,275 --> 02:13:26,472
I want to talk to you. 
Come with me.

1360
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:48,092
Why did you let her go? 
Why? 
Why didn't you tell her that I'll be late

1361
02:14:34,947 --> 02:14:37,006
Why did you let her go?

1362
02:14:37,082 --> 02:14:38,947
Where has she gone?

1363
02:14:41,387 --> 02:14:43,617
Sonia. 
- O my God.

1364
02:14:43,956 --> 02:14:45,014
Where had you been?
We are getting late.

1365
02:14:45,090 --> 02:14:48,890
Papa I want to talk to you urgently.
- I don't want to hear anything.

1366
02:14:48,961 --> 02:14:50,895
The flight is taking off. 
Get inside.

1367
02:14:50,963 --> 02:14:53,898
Don't delay. 
- But papa, please.
- Get inside. Come on.

1368
02:14:57,903 --> 02:15:00,565
Where's the passport?

1369
02:15:00,906 --> 02:15:02,965
I've got it.

1370
02:15:03,041 --> 02:15:06,977
Forgive me Tony. 
I made a mistake.

1371
02:15:07,045 --> 02:15:09,104
I had dreamt about many things.

1372
02:15:09,181 --> 02:15:10,239
About you and me.

1373
02:15:10,315 --> 02:15:15,912
But I forgot, dreams never come true..

1374
02:15:15,988 --> 02:15:23,258
..one can only live on hopes.

1375
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:31,335
You are lucky, you got what you wished for.

1376
02:15:31,403 --> 02:15:35,931
The one you loved is with you.

1377
02:15:36,008 --> 02:15:38,067
In every church of Malaga..

1378
02:15:38,143 --> 02:15:41,078
..I'll light a candle for your happiness and long life.

1379
02:15:41,146 --> 02:15:46,209
Enjoy yourself as you used to do it here.

1380
02:15:46,285 --> 02:15:51,882
Don't worry about me.

1381
02:15:53,425 --> 02:15:55,893
You enjoy.
I'll try to live without you.

1382
02:15:55,961 --> 02:15:58,896
I'll live alone Tony. 
Don't worry about me. I'll live Tony.

1383
02:15:59,431 --> 02:16:02,958
Hey Tony! What are you doing here?
C'mon, we've to check in.

1384
02:16:05,237 --> 02:16:10,174
Madam I'll not go with you.

1385
02:16:10,909 --> 02:16:14,572
What? 
- I'll not go with you.

1386
02:16:14,913 --> 02:16:17,245
You were so excited to go and now..

1387
02:16:18,917 --> 02:16:24,583
I only thought about my happiness so I couldn't see anything else.

1388
02:16:26,191 --> 02:16:30,924
But today I've realized after so many years.

1389
02:16:32,264 --> 02:16:41,468
Tony! 
- Madam, I know, you love me very much.

1390
02:16:44,209 --> 02:16:48,270
You've convinced your father to marry me.

1391
02:16:48,347 --> 02:16:50,144
Tony.. 
- But Madam..

1392
02:16:51,416 --> 02:16:58,549
- I mean.. 
- I know, you can bestow me with happiness, wealth and love.

1393
02:16:58,891 --> 02:17:03,089
But that will be at the cost of someone's sorrow.

1394
02:17:06,298 --> 02:17:09,893
That Neena..

1395
02:17:09,968 --> 02:17:13,904
.. she'll be all alone when I go away.

1396
02:17:13,972 --> 02:17:15,906
She has no one of her own.
She will be very lonely.

1397
02:17:16,909 --> 02:17:18,968
Neena.. - I can understand, you must be thinking,..

1398
02:17:19,044 --> 02:17:22,343
.. why Neena has transpired suddenly.

1399
02:17:22,414 --> 02:17:26,578
But that poor girl was right with me from the very beginning.

1400
02:17:28,353 --> 02:17:33,586
She loves me a lot.
I realised it today.

1401
02:17:33,926 --> 02:17:36,918
I am everything for her.

1402
02:17:36,995 --> 02:17:41,056
She'll die if I go away.

1403
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:45,062
She'll definitely.. die.

1404
02:17:46,471 --> 02:17:52,876
It's difficult to suppress one's love.

1405
02:17:53,946 --> 02:17:58,280
But to break the heart of one who loves you is a grave sin.

1406
02:18:00,419 --> 02:18:06,949
And this sin, Tony will not commit. 
please forgive me.

1407
02:18:12,998 --> 02:18:14,226
I am sorry.

1408
02:18:22,441 --> 02:18:26,309
Sonia my darling! 
When are we going?

1409
02:18:26,378 --> 02:18:29,245
Where is there mad crazy boy of yours?

1410
02:18:29,448 --> 02:18:31,109
He has left.

1411
02:18:31,183 --> 02:18:33,242
I knew it was bound to happen.

1412
02:18:33,318 --> 02:18:35,980
These people never keep their word.

1413
02:18:36,054 --> 02:18:39,922
He might have landed some other job better than ours.

1414
02:18:39,992 --> 02:18:41,254
So he left. 
Scoundrel! Greedy!

1415
02:18:41,393 --> 02:18:47,593
No papa, that greedy Indian rejected your daughter.

1416
02:18:47,933 --> 02:18:51,334
What nonsense! 
What are you talking?

1417
02:18:52,037 --> 02:18:58,135
I was frank with him. He thought I was in love with him.

1418
02:18:58,210 --> 02:19:01,611
And I wanted to marry him.

1419
02:19:01,947 --> 02:19:04,381
Scoundrel! 
How dare he?

1420
02:19:05,951 --> 02:19:13,016
Papa, agreed Tony is poor.
But his dreams were high.

1421
02:19:13,091 --> 02:19:18,154
And today he shattered his dreams because he realised that..

1422
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:23,293
.. Neena loved him and he rejected me, your wealth..

1423
02:19:23,368 --> 02:19:28,965
.. and his dream of being a rich man. all for her.

1424
02:19:29,975 --> 02:19:34,036
And whatever I dreamt..

1425
02:19:34,112 --> 02:19:38,640
.. I shattered it for your respect your love.

1426
02:19:40,252 --> 02:19:46,316
That was not a dream Papa.
That was love, true love!

1427
02:19:46,391 --> 02:19:49,258
Which I have understood today.

1428
02:19:50,929 --> 02:19:55,992
You gave me all the happiness..

1429
02:19:56,068 --> 02:20:01,597
.. but today I beg you for my love.

1430
02:20:03,275 --> 02:20:08,269
Prem is the biggest happiness of my life.

1431
02:20:08,346 --> 02:20:11,076
I want to live with him.

1432
02:20:11,283 --> 02:20:16,619
I'll not let you meet that bloody journalist.

1433
02:20:16,955 --> 02:20:18,422
He is an Indian.

1434
02:20:18,957 --> 02:20:24,054
He'll cheat you, just like your mother left us alone.

1435
02:20:24,129 --> 02:20:26,495
My mother didn't cheat us.

1436
02:20:26,965 --> 02:20:31,163
But she had learnt, she was suffering from some dangerous disease.

1437
02:20:31,236 --> 02:20:35,036
So she returned alone to Malaga.

1438
02:20:35,107 --> 02:20:38,508
So that you and I could live.

1439
02:20:38,977 --> 02:20:41,639
No, I can't believe this.

1440
02:20:41,980 --> 02:20:46,644
If she was ill why didn't she tell me? 
I would take care of her.

1441
02:20:46,918 --> 02:20:49,910
Why she didn't write a letter.

1442
02:20:51,189 --> 02:20:55,922
In a country where loves means sacrifice,..

1443
02:20:55,994 --> 02:20:59,930
.. how can a woman of that country be a cheat?

1444
02:21:00,932 --> 02:21:06,996
only an Indian can make such a big sacrifice.

1445
02:21:14,012 --> 02:21:18,472
Papa, these are the letters that mummy wrote to you.

1446
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:21,009
But she never malled them.

1447
02:21:21,086 --> 02:21:25,352
Thank you. I'll ask your mother for forgiveness.

1448
02:21:26,391 --> 02:21:30,157
And you go to Prem, whom you love.

1449
02:21:31,229 --> 02:21:37,498
Thank you papa. - I am sorry.
- Thank you, thank you.

1450
02:21:48,346 --> 02:21:52,908
You remember, I had said, if your love is true..

1451
02:21:52,984 --> 02:21:58,183
.. he will definitely come back to you.

1452
02:21:58,924 --> 02:22:01,984
Look, I have returned.

1453
02:22:06,198 --> 02:22:07,927
You also eat.

1454
02:22:07,999 --> 02:22:11,127
I've decided, I'll aIways have my food after you have it.

1455
02:22:11,203 --> 02:22:13,330
- Any problem? 
- No.

1456
02:22:17,943 --> 02:22:20,002
What happened, Tony?

1457
02:22:20,078 --> 02:22:21,943
Sonia madam has followed me here. 
- Yes.

1458
02:22:24,382 --> 02:22:26,282
She didn't go with her father.

1459
02:22:26,484 --> 02:22:32,013
How could she? 
Her love is here.

1460
02:22:36,494 --> 02:22:38,291
How much will I hurt her?
 - Yes.

1461
02:22:40,966 --> 02:22:44,424
She looks pale. 
She looks gloomy.

1462
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:56,575
Look at her plight, she can neither laugh nor cry.

1463
02:22:58,383 --> 02:23:00,248
Doesn't matter. 
It happens in love.

1464
02:23:00,318 --> 02:23:03,913
She'll overcome as time passes by.
What to do? I'm only one. Go on, eat.

1465
02:23:05,257 --> 02:23:06,451
Do not worry Tony.

1466
02:23:06,524 --> 02:23:08,048
Everything think will be all right.

1467
02:23:08,126 --> 02:23:11,926
Look Tony is sitting there.
Go and thank him.

1468
02:23:11,997 --> 02:23:15,057
Had it not been for him,
we wouldn't have met.

1469
02:23:15,133 --> 02:23:19,934
Anyway that thing..
- No need to say anything.

1470
02:23:21,273 --> 02:23:23,332
Let him think that a princess came from a far off country,..

1471
02:23:23,408 --> 02:23:26,605
.. who loved him very much.

1472
02:23:26,945 --> 02:23:31,211
And he rejected the princess for an ordinary girl.

1473
02:23:32,951 --> 02:23:37,149
Some dreams are so beautiful that you can't shatter them.
