1
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,376
Yes? -Greetings, Mr. Khanna.

2
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,220
There is a case for Mr. Arjun.

3
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,312
Sir, Jeetu has been caught.

4
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,349
He has revealed your name, sir.

5
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,251
Mr. Khanna, l want Arjun Kapoor.

6
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,345
Mr. Kapoor is in a courtroom
right now.

7
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,350
Yes, l acknowledge that
you can pay his fees. .

8
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,260
. .but he doesn't accept
small-time clients.

9
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,265
We have received news
that the murderers. .

10
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,392
. .of Mr. Rai have been acquitted
by the court.

11
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,267
ln this case, the accused
were close. .

12
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,239
. .to being hanged
it was believed.

13
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,366
However, criminal lawyer
Arjun Kapoor. .

14
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,444
. .used his statements to prove. .

15
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,244
. .that as an advocate
he is above the law.

16
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,509
He uses the weaknesses of law. .

17
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,378
. .and always wins as a genius
of legal proceedings.

18
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,254
He has now become a saviour
of criminals.

19
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,416
Look at Sonam'ts picture again.

20
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,421
We are filled with pity to find
Sonam in this condition.

21
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,433
However, the truth is
this, your honour.

22
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,436
Sonam was a girl from
the middle-class. .

23
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,306
. .but had big aspirations.

24
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,266
She was ridden by greed and
glamour and ended up like this.

25
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,339
Now look at my client
Raj Thakur.

26
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,283
A business tycoon, eligible
bachelor, well educated. .

27
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,381
What would he gain by raping
and killing Sonam?

28
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,283
My client has accepted
in court that. .

29
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,420
. .Sonam came to him in
an inebriated state. .

30
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,227
. .and they agreed to
go to bed together.

31
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,393
That'ts it, your honour.

32
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,396
This girl has bedded many
people for small gains. .

33
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,338
. .such as Mr. Wadhwa.

34
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,311
For just not returning
25000 rupees. .

35
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,347
. .she consented to have sex.

36
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,275
Mr. Raghuvanshi. To get promoted
in her office. .

37
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,250
. .she even consented to
have sex with him.

38
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,358
Your honour, l have shown all
this evidence in court. .

39
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,262
. .but l'td like to say this
again to the court. .

40
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:29,300
Raj'ts finger prints
on Sonam'ts body. .

41
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,428
. .had been recovered when
they were making love. .

42
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,397
. .and not due to murder.

43
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,368
Your honour, according to
the lndian Penal Code. .

44
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,311
. .until a weapon used for murder
isn't presented in court. .

45
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,340
. .as evidence no accused, can
under any condition be. .

46
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:51,346
. .proved to be a criminal.

47
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
There, these people have come
too. -Mr. Arjun Kapoor. .

48
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,287
. .can you tell us how you proved
Mr. Raj Thakur to be innocent?

49
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,232
l always knew my client
to be innocent.

50
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,494
All evidence gained from the
police investigation. .

51
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,361
. .were against Raj Thakur. .

52
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,307
Who is this man whom you
are interviewing?!

53
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,310
l'tll reveal the truth about him !

54
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,437
l know this murderer!

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,508
You vile inhuman scoundrel !

56
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,374
Evil man ! -Listen. .

57
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,317
He killed my daughter
in one attempt.

58
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,255
Why did you defame her in court?

59
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,415
How many times will you abuse. .

60
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,358
. .my daughter before
everyone in court?!

61
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,418
How many times will you do it?

62
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,222
Which mother gave birth to
a fiendish son like you?

63
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,428
My curse will ruin you !
lt will ruin you.

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,262
You will be ridden by worms.
You will go to hell !

65
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,332
Stop it, Parvati.
Stop! -My child. .

66
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,369
Don't curse him. Bless
him instead.

67
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,245
A girl should be
born to him too.

68
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,309
Only then will he understand
the meaning. .

69
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,354
. .of a daughter and her dignity.

70
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,257
Come on. -l spit on you !

71
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,227
Come along.

72
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,296
Mr. Kapoor, when you look at
this woman'ts condition. .

73
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,390
. .don't you feel that
you shouldn't help. .

74
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,401
. .your friend but the truth?

75
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,252
l still can't believe
this, friend.

76
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,421
l think the entire
caste is similar.

77
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,518
Their daughter was like this
too. She accepted it first.

78
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,318
Then she refused at the last
moment. l killed her in anger.

79
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,264
Forget it Raj. l don't want
to listed to all this.

80
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,326
You know that l asked the
old couple to accept. .

81
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,394
. .something and make a
settlement out of court.

82
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,268
They are bloody idiots.

83
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,308
Their young daughter earned
money and ran household expenses.

84
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,309
They were trying to hang me.

85
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,402
Just stop it. Don't talk
to me about all this.

86
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,506
What happened to you?

87
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,481
What difference will it make
if we talk about this?

88
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,381
This means that you won't listen
to me for that old hag.

89
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,326
You won't listen to your friend.

90
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,321
Raj, this isn't the court
but your house and. .

91
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,389
. .l am your advocate
and not a judge.

92
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,263
At least out of court
you must accept. .

93
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,394
. .that you are just a criminal.

94
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,438
Yes, l am. So what?

95
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,402
lf you don't remember, Arjun,
let me remind you.

96
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,337
You have only saved criminals
till today.

97
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,439
ln fact, your vehicles
and great apartment. .

98
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,376
. .have been earned
with that money.

99
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,215
Right?

100
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,383
Arjun, you didn't
choose your life.

101
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,353
ln fact, life has chosen you.

102
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,391
You are born to defend criminals,
my friend. Cheers to that!

103
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,496
l'tm leaving.

104
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,333
Arjun, at least finish
this drink.

105
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:05,249
Arjun ! Let me remind you that l
paid you well for this case!

106
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,259
You'tre stuck, my friend.
You'tre stuck.

107
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,328
'tWhich mother gave birth to
a fiendish son like you?'t

108
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,217
'the number you are trying to
call is currently not reachable.'t

109
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,418
'tMy curse will ruin you !
-You will go to hell ! 't

110
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,446
ln fact, your vehicles
and great apartment. .

111
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,452
. .have been earned
with that money.

112
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,448
We are revealing the
news of this day.

113
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,309
ln the high profile murder case
going on for some time. .

114
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,354
. .Mumbai High Court has
taken a decision.

115
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,448
You will be ridden by worms.
You will go to hell !

116
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,353
Bless him. Bless him, Parvati.

117
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,301
You will die a worm'ts death.

118
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,337
Even God won't help
you in any way.

119
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,372
You will never gain something.

120
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,208
You will never be happy.
You'tll go to hell.

121
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,278
You will be ridden by worms!
-You'tll be punished.

122
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,405
May God cause you to receive
curses from all of us.

123
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,450
My curse will hurt you.
-You will go to hell.

124
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,444
You'tll be ruined !

125
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,281
Son, not as a high court judge. .

126
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,414
but as a father l'tm trying
to explain this to you.

127
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:35,316
Don't use law to earn money but
to help innocents to get justice.

128
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,400
Where were you? -Excuse
me. . 'tHi, hello't.

129
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,293
There are such words in
existence, advocate Kapoor.

130
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,371
For the first time in the day
you are talking to your. .

131
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,407
. .girlfriend not to a criminal.

132
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,402
l'tm stressed out.
l can't sleep. .

133
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,337
For the first time l question
myself as to. .

134
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,438
. .why l didn't listen to father.

135
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,410
l was always after
money and fame.

136
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,387
Baby, what'ts the problem?

137
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,348
Nothing'ts the problem. lt'ts
just that l am fed up.

138
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,226
What do l get by saving
criminals?

139
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,389
Curses from people.

140
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,356
Curses and abuses.

141
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,266
After every case is over,
l am only blamed.

142
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,443
l am only abused. What
have l gained?

143
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:31,305
This money which can't give
me calm even for a moment?

144
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,240
l'tm tired of it.

145
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,253
But this is your profession,
Arjun.

146
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,323
Why are you thinking
about all this?

147
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,392
lts part of being a
criminal lawyer. .

148
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,229
. .and l am sure we
all know that.

149
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,456
Yes, of course l know that it is
a part of being a criminal. .

150
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,227
. .lawyer and that'ts
why l am fed up!

151
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,235
l hear voices of criminals.

152
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,430
l see the same faces.

153
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,503
l think enough is enough.

154
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,240
That Raj is guilty. .

155
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,209
. .and l am quitting his
case tomorrow morning.

156
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,338
That'ts final.

157
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,247
Please. . please don't.

158
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,250
Let'ts meet up and discuss.

159
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,413
Do you want me to come over?

160
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,518
l'tll talk to you tomorrow,
baby. Bye.

161
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,442
Are you insane, Arjun? No way!

162
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,445
You can't quit from
this case now.

163
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,438
l won't even allow
you to do that.

164
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,273
Look, Arjun.

165
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,310
ln this profession. .

166
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,354
. .every person has such
instances in life.

167
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,257
He feels guilty then.
So, big deal !

168
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,385
Overcome it and finish
the case. Come on.

169
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,521
All rise.

170
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,370
Let us proceed with the final
hearing of the case.

171
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,405
Your honour.

172
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,345
l want to question my client,
Mr. Raj Thakur.

173
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,258
As far as l know, your
statements and the prosecution'ts. .

174
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,418
. .statements ended yesterday.

175
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,259
Today, only the final decision
was to be taken.

176
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,356
Purely on the basis of the case
you have presented so far.

177
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,457
l hope you realise that.

178
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,502
You are absolutely right,
your honour.

179
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,430
Yesterday in the evening,
l found some things. .

180
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,240
. .which l wish to reveal
to the court.

181
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,443
Do l have permission to do so?

182
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,317
aPlease approach the bench.

183
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,346
Mr. Raj Thakur. .

184
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,350
. .when you were sober yesterday
you said to me. .

185
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,418
. .that before raping and killing
the victim Sonam,

186
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,361
. .you were very drunk.
ls that right?!

187
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,300
This is false, Milord. Why
are you blabbering?

188
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,358
l asked you to approach
the bench !

189
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,336
You even said to me that
Sonam agreed at first.

190
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,270
When she became a little sober. .

191
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,365
. .you forced her and when
she didn't listen. .

192
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,309
Approach the bench l said !
-Then you killed her!

193
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,437
Just stop him, Milord.

194
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,405
Stop it, advocate Kapoor!

195
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,246
Please approach the
bench right now.

196
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,344
l will not stop it, Milord.

197
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,413
l will not approach the bench
because l am not done yet.

198
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,356
l will hold you in
contempt of court.

199
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,360
l hold myself in contempt
of court. .

200
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,329
. .because this man is a
rapist and a murderer!

201
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,226
Hang this man, Milord ! Give
him capital punishment.

202
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,359
That is my request!
-Enough is enough.

203
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,403
l have had enough of
your arguments.

204
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,440
You have dishonoured the court
and it will not tolerate this. .

205
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,333
. .advocate Kapoor.

206
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,249
Arjun Kapoor is to be presented
before the bar council.

207
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,322
Until then, proceedings of the
court are being stopped.

208
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,328
ls this your final decision?

209
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,256
Yes.

210
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,301
Mr. Thakur, hire another lawyer.

211
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,361
You can proceed with your
case. -Sure sir.

212
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,407
Thank you for allowing
me to do so.

213
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,375
That would be better than having
such an insane lawyer.

214
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,440
What is it that you want to do?

215
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,404
l. .

216
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,349
l think l need a break.

217
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,344
Alright. .

218
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,413
. .when you get back your mind
to continue practice. .

219
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,492
. .you can renew your license.

220
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,300
Why did you do all this, Arjun?

221
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,303
What has happened to you?

222
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,330
Why are you finishing
a fine career?

223
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,299
You are going to be a partner
in the law firm.

224
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,436
ln fact, Urvashi. . that
is what l told him.

225
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,338
You did wrong, Arjun.
You'tll pay for it.

226
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,212
You didn't care about
my friendship. .

227
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,409
. .nor about the money
l gave you.

228
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,516
Listen to me, man. -You listen
to me advocate Arjun Kapoor.

229
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,313
l will somehow save myself
from this case.

230
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,393
lf you can, save yourself
somehow from my anger. .

231
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,353
. .because l never forget
being insulted.

232
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,295
l save criminals. l don't
argue with them.

233
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,393
Come Urvashi.

234
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,449
Mr. Raj Thakur, is it true that
your lawyer Mr. Arjun Kapoor. .

235
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,417
. .in a court session accused
you of rape and murder.

236
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,388
Mr. Thakur, a lawyer who always
used to save criminals. .

237
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,290
How did he suddenly change on
knowing the truth in a case?

238
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,383
The truth isn't what Arjun
Kapoor revealed to the court.

239
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,362
l have hired advocate Jethmalani
to bring the truth forward.

240
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,297
He'tll prove my innocence
and you all shall know.

241
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,232
What about Arjun Kapoor'ts
accusation?

242
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,394
That is between him and me.

243
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,303
l will reply to him directly.
Right? Thanks.

244
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,398
The question is why did Arjun
Kapoor who used to. .

245
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,240
. .save criminals, suddenly
change his decision?

246
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,373
Another question is what
differences were caused. .

247
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,250
. .between these two to
cause such hatred.

248
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:12,312
Do we assume here that Arjun
Kapoor'ts conscience has risen?

249
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,326
For all these questions,
we will have to wait.

250
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,361
Our Conscience, Zee News.

251
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,329
Did you see his face?

252
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,363
lt was like if you
were before him. .

253
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,405
Arjun, he can be dangerous.

254
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,382
l have seen many dangerous faces
in my four year old career.

255
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,409
l am not afraid of him.

256
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,511
You are dealing with
criminals. -Why?

257
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,313
Wasn't l dealing with
criminals until now?

258
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,315
l know that.

259
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,227
You took your decision as. .

260
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,321
. .if l am not of any importance
in your life.

261
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,391
Have you ever thought. .

262
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,267
. .with whom l would return
home from court?

263
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,395
With whom will l share
coffee in office?

264
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,304
With whom will l argue about
case proceedings?

265
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,311
lf l need advice. .

266
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,380
There is Mr. Khanna.
You can ask him.

267
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,373
l'tm sorry, Urvashi but
l need a break, ok?

268
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,476
No one can understand what
l am going through. .

269
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,288
. .nor do l expect anyone
to understand.

270
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,515
Sorry. l didn't mean to. .

271
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,355
What did you decide then?
What will you do?

272
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,423
Goa.

273
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,339
l need a break. l need
to take a break. .

274
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,374
. .from everything and everyone.

275
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,277
We have a family house there.

276
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,505
l want to spend some time alone.

277
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,313
What about me?

278
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,283
What should l do here?

279
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,516
Practise. Fight for justice.

280
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,449
lf possible, wait for me.

281
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,352
You mean, we won't be in touch?

282
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,387
No calls. . nothing?

283
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,360
Alright.

284
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,240
When are you going? -Tomorrow.

285
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,339
The earlier the better.

286
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,504
l hope you understand.

287
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:33,287
'this is the story of the
devil'ts advocate.'t

288
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,279
l am the king of
my profession.

289
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,347
l can do whatever l please.

290
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:07,321
l can save a criminal
from being hanged.

291
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,361
Commit any kind of crime.

292
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,305
Don't be afraid of law.

293
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,408
Commit any kind of crime.

294
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,376
Don't be afraid of law.

295
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:25,280
Watch out, watch your back.

296
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,414
My conscience questioned me.

297
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,315
Now l take care about what
is right and wrong.

298
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,317
l was cheating myself.

299
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,259
Now the situation has changed.

300
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,382
There is nothing great
in the world of crime.

301
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,418
There is nothing greater
than the truth.

302
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,453
There is nothing great
in the world of crime.

303
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,455
There is nothing greater
than the truth.

304
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:43,284
Now l am not what
l was earlier.

305
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:51,268
Now l am not what
l was earlier.

306
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,374
Hello son.

307
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,249
Hello son !

308
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,288
ls this for hire?

309
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,416
lt'ts already hired.

310
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,384
So what?

311
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,430
We can share the hire.

312
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,296
Today l feel like fishing.

313
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:01,304
l don't sing while fishing.
l won't disturb you.

314
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,401
You won't listen to me?

315
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,345
What the hell? Come up.

316
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,370
Thank you.

317
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,341
Come on.

318
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,353
Give me your hand.

319
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,321
Beer? -Thank you.

320
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,526
Any luck? -Nothing yet.

321
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,366
Tell me, young man. What
are you doing here?

322
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,436
Are you spending holidays?
-Holidays? Oh no!

323
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,274
This is my retirement
policy. -Retirement?

324
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:52,255
All this suits an
old man like me.

325
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,427
lt'ts getting choppy.
-What happened?

326
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,289
Nothing? -Why retire at
such a young age then?

327
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,496
Actually, l'tm a lawyer.

328
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,270
l used to practise law.
l was very busy.

329
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,333
l mean, people were
all around me.

330
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,511
l couldn't make out what was
right and what was wrong.

331
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,511
All that mattered was winning.

332
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:29,382
l found out that it'ts not
of worth and here l am.

333
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,289
So, you are a pure man now.

334
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,392
Maybe.

335
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,428
You know. .

336
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,402
. .there is one thing
common between us.

337
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,313
Law. -Really?

338
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,283
Yeah. l used to work
in a law firm too.

339
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,377
Now l have written a novel.

340
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:01,322
Crime thriller, based on law.
-Sounds interesting.

341
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,487
Would you like to read
it? -l'td love to.

342
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,365
Let'ts meet at my place
in the evening then.

343
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:12,233
We'tll have a drink each and
l'tll give you the book too.

Arjun. l like it that way.

Arjun, l was saying that
our publishing house. .

418
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,292
. .doesn't entertain
a new writer. .

419

421
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,344
Great. Thank you very much.

422

. .in the case of Ms. Sonam'ts
rape and murder. .

424

. .the main accused Raj Thakur
has been acquitted by court.

425
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,289
Advocate Arjun Kapoor was
arguing this case earlier. .

426
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,417
. .but he later blamed the
accused and left the case.

427
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,359
After this, advocate Desai
carried forward this case. .

428
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,330
. .and he presented such
statements before court. .

429
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,264
. .which were praiseworthy.

430
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,462
After listening to the
statements, the court decided. .

431
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,367
'the number you are trying to
call is currently not reachable.'t

432
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,310

ln your novel, there is a
watermark bearing 'tMcNamara't.

444
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,355
Sophia, actually. . -Well,
not a chance, darling.

445
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,325
lf you want me to publish
this novel. .

446
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,335
. .l'tll need your original
name. That'ts my USP.

447

454
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,222
Wow! Such a big amount
in royalty. .

455
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,314
. .and 20 percent share
in profits.

456
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,416
lsn't that too generous? -Well. .

457

458
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,389
l liked the novel a lot too.

459

l mean, it is a great
piece of writing. .

460
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,327
. .but such high aspirations
scare me.

461
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,298
There is fear only where
there is doubt.

462
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,376
l am completely certain.

463
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,337
What a title! 'tFix the fox.'t

ln fact, you know, l was
surprised to read. .

465
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,248
Although you are a
lawyer yourself. .

466
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,278
. .you showed cunningness
against laws.

467
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,349
Well but then maybe that is what
is called writer'ts honesty.

468
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,522
Come, let me show you something.

469
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,260

691
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,509
Come on, drop me home now.

692
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,215
Yes boss.

693
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,251
Excuse me, sir. -Tell me.

694

Good morning. -. .that
man was the tout.

He must have paid the ACP.

702
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,267
Such officers have brought
disrepute to the whole dept.

703
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,272
Do you also take bribes? -Sir l !

704
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,442
Seeing your eyes it seems. .

705
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,410
. .that you too are not honest.

706
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,512
Sorry sir!

707
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,440
Hey! What'ts happened to him?

708
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,418
Normally he finds it
uncomfortable to sit.

709
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,218
Today he is stuck to his seat.

710
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,349
Seems sir has got something
interesting in his hands. -Come.

711
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,360
Till then we'tll bash
up Gulati some more.

712
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:29,229
He'tll take time. Today we'tve got
the chance to punch. -Come.

713
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,345
Ravi. Ravi !

Sorry sir. -Do you come here to
sleep or work? -Sorry sir.

Nothing, go to sleep.

722
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,537
The sir is mad.

723
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,353
Yes. Are you waiting for me?

724
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,293

727
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:20,309
Your novel dragged me here. l
read it and became your fan.

728
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,447
You wrote it, isn't it?

729
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,474
Let'ts go inside and talk. -Sure.

730
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,425
What will have? Beer,
whisky or rum?

731
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,259
No need for any formalities.

732
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:43,365
lf you don't mind can
l have my drink?

733
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,325
Whether you drink
whisky or rum. .

734
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,334
. .it'ts your good time,
Mr. Kapoor.

735
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,399
Cheers! What do you want
to discuss with me?

736
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:55,368
l'tm impressed Mr. Kapoor.
What detailing you do.

737
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,277
That underwater murder
of Mr. Lahiri. .

738
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,239
. .how well you have
described that.

739
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,341
You wrote it isn't it?

740
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,489
Yeah l guess, l think so.

741
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,247
l wrote it, why?

742
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,519
The details of the murder of
JK Singh that you'tve given. .

743
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:16,254
Great! Feels like the murder
happened before you.

744
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:20,264
From the colour of the shoes
till buttons on the shirt.

745
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,405
The details that you'tve given. .

746
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,431
You wrote it, isn't it?

747
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,338
Yes, l wrote. -Then that
Shivdasani'ts murder. .

748
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,445
You'tve gone to the extent of
writing that before he died. .

749
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,384
. .he didn't utter the name
of his wife or children. .

750
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,222
. .but he said the name
of his mistress.

751
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,382
And blood was not only
through his ears. .

752
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,323
. .but also from his left eyes. .

753
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,362
. . a drop of blood
was oozing out.

754
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,291
Great! What detailing
you'tve done.

755
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,495
This too you wrote it, isn't it?

756
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,275
l'tm not able to understand
what you'tre saying.

757
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:06,476
Because after every description
you ask me the same question. .

758
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,342
. .whether l wrote
that book or not.

759
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,344
lt'ts my name on the
book, isn't it?

760
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:13,344
Mr. Kapoor.

761
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:15,448
l liked your book quite a lot.

762
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,522
That'ts why l want to hear from
your mouth that all these. .

763
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,227
. .you'tve written yourself.

764
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:24,288
Okay.

765
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,333
Then hear it.

766
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,269
l wrote this book.

767
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:31,430
That'ts it. This is what
l wanted to hear.

768
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,265
Boys, come in.

769
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,284
What the hell is this?

770
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:52,523
Hell is where you'tre going.

771
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,428
What is my crime?

772
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,297
That l'tll tell you.

773
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:05,502
The camera is ready? -Yeah.

774
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:07,504
She'ts coming. -Lights please.

775
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,503

00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,312
Madam, what happened that. .

00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,215
. .he has been arrested
because of the book.

779
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,253
Look. l don't know anything
about this.

780
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,217
This is news for me also.

781
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,280
l don't know anything about it.

782
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,317
Let me get to the detail
of it first. .

783
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,250
. .then l'tll talk to the media.

784
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,230
Thank you. -Madam, wait!

785
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,365
Listen. Novel controversy man.

00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,390
Get further one lakh
copies printed.

787
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,395
Madam, please. -Please
some questions. .

788
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,301
Madam, please. -Please
some questions. .

789
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,304
One lakh !

790
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,282
Mr. Kapoor.

791
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,386
l'tm advocate Gary.

792
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,312
ln this case l will be
arguing against you.

793
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,414
Why don't you come to the
point? What'ts my crime?

794
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,326
The craze that you had
to write a novel. .

795
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,387
. .that craze is going
to drown you now.

796
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,266
Writing novels is not a crime.

797
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,392
When did l say that/

798
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,429
The novel writers are respected.

799
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,260
They get awards.

800
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,373
But the one that
you'tve written. .

801
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,338
. .in that there is some fault.

802
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,274
The novel in which you'tve
written the story of 5 murders. .

803
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,381
They'tve all really happened.

804
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,412
Not only that the situation. .

805
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,221
. .in all respects they are real.

806
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,262
The files of all the 5 murders. .

807
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,387
. .are shut in the record room
of police department.

808
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:39,333
Those files are lying
there because. .

809
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,295
. .an important clue
is missing in them.

810
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,534
That clue the man murdered
would know or else. .

811
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,365
. .or the murderer.

812
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,241
The murdered are dead.

813
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,304
But the murderer. .

814
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,374
. .that'ts you.

815
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,514
Mr. Kapoor, l don't believe it.

816
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,287
Being a lawyer yourself, you. .

817
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:03,247
. .killed the lawyers.

818
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,520
You killed your own professional
brothers.

819
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,288
Then you had fun writing
about them.

820
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,389
You called them fox.

821
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,359
You called them cunning.

822
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,326
Every word of yours. .

823
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:19,241
. .will be like the hangman'ts
noose for you.

824
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,332
This is a lie.

825
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,336
This book actually was. .

826
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,336
it'ts fiction damn it.

827
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:27,441
From the names of the people
who were murdered. .

828
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,285
. .the names of places
and all the details. .

829
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,513
. .that you'tve mentioned
in your novel.

830
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,312
They are real, Mr. Kapoor.

831
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,321
They match with the
police record.

832
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,387
Now you don't say that you
didn't write this novel.

833
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,264
This Mr. Kapoor can't say.

834
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,297
l asked him again and again. .

835
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,236
. .that did you write it.

836
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,437
Did you write it?

837
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,431
And he said loudly that
he has written it.

838
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,331
Mr. Kapoor.

839
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,499
Am l telling a lie?

840
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,242
l want. . -Sure.

841
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,342
That wasn't discussed.

842
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,384
What'ts all this?

843
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,253
l don't know.

844
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,358
if you hadn't told me
about the novel. .

845
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,431
. .then probably l wouldn't
have also believed today.

846
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,400
l checked the files
about the murders.

847
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,378
Also read the book again.

848
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,247
Each and everything is the same.

849
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,419
My god ! -You tell me.

850
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,346
First that man.

851
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,225
Get his death certificate.

852
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,448
All the evidences. .

853
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,352
. .get all of them together.

854
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:51,388
Okay.

855
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,250
January 10, 1986.

856
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,243
Here is your certificate.

857
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,347

858
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,518
All of you go out and

859
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,317
Come on.

860
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,329
Brother please. Please
listen to me.

861
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,389
lt'ts an emergency.

862
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,401
l'tll just take one minute.

There is no death certificate

He knows everything and he

Find him. -Gaithunde!

Constable Gaithunde. -No madam.

884
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,330
There is no constable Gaithunde
in Mapsa area.

885
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,369
Check up the police
stations nearby.

886
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,408
ln Mapsa area only a policeman
from Mapsa will go.

887
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,419
The rule is a rule. -l know,
but you check once.

888
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:53,317
Check the areas nearby. -You !

889
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:56,320
Heat the tea and bring. -Okay
sir. -What the hell !

890
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,318
You people are also like this.

891
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,222
Look here.

892
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,295
This is Kalangore.

Panjim. Madgaon.

894
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:08,401
ln none of these areas there
is no constable Gaithunde.

895
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,429
Sorry madam. Go now. Don't
waste our time.

896
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,378
Got all the nearby areas
checked Arjun.

897
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,410
There is no constable
Gaithunde anywhere.

898
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,248
l'tve been set up, Urvashi.

899
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,251
That means that someone
is after me.

900
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,324
if you ask me then this
has only one solution.

901
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,263
There is only one man
who can help us.

902
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,366
Who? -Yashwant Deshmukh.

903
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,428
Are you mad, Urvashi?

904
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,396
The guy is a damn psycho.
Doesn't talk straight.

905
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,297
He is doing his duty.

906
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:48,241
You too were like this
when you worked.

907
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,237
l'tll not talk to him.

908
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,251
You must do it, Arjun.

909
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,254
There is no other way out.

910
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:12,423
Sir!

911
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:15,496

01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,403
He'ts a criminal. He has
committed 5 murders.

915
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,316
l feel that the poor
guy. . -Poor guy!

916
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:28,407
Why a poor guy?

917
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,385

Save your money, Raj.

927

You'tre a criminal.

928
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:32,414
You may need money any time
to buy the police and law.

929
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,407
You know Arjun?

930
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,288
You must think more about
your future than mine.

931
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:42,413
They'tll hang you anytime.

932
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:49,331
l never know that behind
the black robe. .

933
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,389
. .there will be blood stains
of 5 persons murdered.

934
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,368
l think you'tre a psycho.

935
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:55,361
Before capital punishment. .

936
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,372
. .you should be taken
to a mental asylum.

937
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,440
You did this all, didn't you?

938
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,308
Understand one thing.

939
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:13,310

945
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,355

947
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,273
And l'tll drink more.

01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,280
Come to the office tomorrow.
-l want to talk to you now.

950
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,371
Please!

951
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,216
You'tve a lot of confidence in. .

952
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,378
. .Arjun Kapoor?

953
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:23,289
About his innocence?

954
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:28,258
A lot sir. Arjun can't
murder anybody.

955
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:32,332
The one who everyday using the
force of money in court. .

956
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:36,295
. .plays the game of proving
truth as lies. .

957
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,307
. .he can do anything, Urvashi.

958
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,239
You'tre wrong sir.

959
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:45,403
He couldn't face his
own conscience.

960
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,443
That'ts why he left everything
and came here.

961
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:52,277
His career was at the peak.

962
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,516
but he left everything. And. .

963
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,384
. .when he started the
life as a good man. .

964
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,224
. .then someone has trapped
him badly like this.

965
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,263
What do you want from me?

966
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,259
l want that you meet Arjun once.

967
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:12,271
Hear him out. He wants
to tell you something.

968
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,379
Tomorrow at 1 1 . You also come.

969
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:22,416
Be on time. -Thank you sir.

970
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,528
That'ts how l'tve been trapped.

971
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,270
Writer, you'tre great.

972
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:21,265
You wrote a great story. -This
is not a story, believe me.

973
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:25,276
The law relies on evidence.

974
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:29,247
No one can know this better
than you, Arjun Kapoor.

975
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:32,252
How can l search for evidence
sitting inside?

976
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,412
Take me out once.

977
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,458
lf l get out on bail then
l'tll get the evidence.

978
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:43,364
Okay, l'tll try to get you out.

979
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:50,395
Think it over Yashwant.
For 5 days. .

980
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,398
. .Arjun Kapoor can be given
in your custody.

981
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,308
But during this time. .

982
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,379
. .if an accident happens
to Arjun Kapoor. .

983
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,309
. .or escapes from your custody. .

984
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,305
. .then you'tll be held
responsible.

985
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,250
ls that clear?

986
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:05,413
You'tve to be with him 24x 7.

987
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,512
Yes sir.

988
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,315
Okay then, go ahead.

989
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,283
Thank you.

990
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,370
This is my house and not
crime branch lock up.

991
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,366
Stay here like a guest. But. .

992
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,401
. .don't forget that l'tm
on duty here too.

993
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,438
Really nice house. You'tve
a nice house. -Thank you.

994
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,274
lt would'tve been nice
if you had stayed. .

995
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,217
. .in this good house for
more than 5 days.

996
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,343
it'ts regrettable that
after 5 days. .

997
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,410
. .you'tve to be back
in the lock up.

998
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:42,347
Why are you saying
such things, sir?

999
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,254
Believe it, Arjun is innocent.

1000
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,453
5 days. ln 5 days if
you can prove it. .

1001
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,399
. .then prove it. And then. .

1002
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,392
Don't try to run away.

1003
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,530
l shoot escaping criminals.

1004
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,351
There before us. That'ts
his house.

1005
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,353
Yeah ! Stop here.

1006
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:46,376
This is his house.

1007
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,317
lt seems that no one has stayed
here for a long time.

1008
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,422
l promise you sir.

1009
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,290
This is McNamara'ts house.

1010
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,337
lf you don't believe me you
can ask the neighbours.

1011
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,330
Okay let us do that too.

1012
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:10,302
How many times you'tre ringing
the door bell? What'ts it?

1013
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:11,504
Why are you ringing
the bell twice?

1014
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,406
Sorry madam, we disturbed you.

1015
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,217
First you disturb and
then apologise?

1016
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,377
Come on, tell me fast.
What'ts the matter?

1017
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,353
ln the house opposite
did McNamara live?

1018
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,286
We need to know about him.

1019
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,324
Mac and in the house opposite?

1020
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:26,326
No McNamara lived there.
Mr. D'tSouza lived there.

1021
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:27,384
D'tSouza? -Yes.

1022
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,221
No, but an old man lived
in the opposite.

1023
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,426
He wore specs. Big nose.
-Yes. -Short.

1024
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,226
That'ts Mr. D'tSouza.

1025
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:39,240
He was a nice man. Everyone
should get such a tenant.

1026
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:43,244
You know? He hired the
mansion for one week.

1027
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,405
He also gave the entire
money in advance.

1028
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,381
That too in cash.

1029
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,411
But on the 12th of this month
the police came because. .

1030
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,421
. .McNamara, l mean
D't Souza died.

01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,422
ls D'tSouza dead?

1032
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:59,255
On 12th morning he came
and gave me the keys.

1033
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:02,354
That'ts not possible. -Time for
dreaming is over Mr. Kapoor.

1034
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,231
Now it'ts time to think.

1035
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:10,271
Before renting the house did he
give any forwarding address?

1036
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,398
No. -He must'tve given a phone
number. -He gave nothing.

1037
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,210
No, he just said that
he'ts come for 8 days.

1038
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:16,301
There must be a landline. .

1039
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,436
. .in that house, can l get
the number of that?

1040
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,315
Excuse me. Who are all of you?

1041
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,373
Why are you asking
so many questions?

1042
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,417
l'tm from crime branch.

1043
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:24,309
The police are looking
for that man.

1044
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,284
Police! Oh god !

1045
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,515
Has he created some problem?

1046
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,418
Anyway, what'ts the use of taking
the number of the landline?

1047
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,419
He never phoned from the mansion
since the line was cut.

1048
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,293
The PCO behind that mansion. .

1049
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,389
See you can see that.

1050
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,393
He used to always
phone from there.

1051
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,361
l'tve taken the number
of this place.

1052
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,430
l'tll have it cross checked.
We might get some clue.

1053
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,509
Your stars seem to be in
a bad shape Mr. Kapoor.

1054
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,375
We got nothing from
the PCO records.

1055
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,384
You must not be believing
in god.

1056
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,215
That'ts why you must not have
consulted on your horoscope.

1057
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:01,389
lt seems. .

1058
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:04,316
. .that you'tll never get time to
consult on your horoscope.

1059
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,375
What happened? Are you
exhausted fighting?

1060
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:32,479
Has the fox like cunning
mind of. .

1061
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,421
. .your'ts stopped functioning
Mr. Kapoor?

1062
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,480
Mr.Deshmukh we are
seeking your help.

1063
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,425
And you are a man of law.

1064
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:41,360
Can't you help to give justice
to an innocent victim?

1065
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:44,365
l am an ordinary police officer.
What help can l give?

1066
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,394
Fine Mr. Kapoor, l
agree to help you.

1067
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:53,305
Tell me how many enemies
do you have?

1068
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,377
l have handled many cases.

1069
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,439
The list will be never ending.
Maybe thousands.

1070
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,410
Think of that one person in them
who hates you the most.

1071
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,353
Raj Thakur. -What?

1072
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,449
Raj Thakur. He must be the
person behind this conspiracy.

1073
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,420
Where does he live? -Mumbai.

1074
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,322
Mumbai?

1075
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,468
That means it will take
two more days.

1076
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,294
ln five days two days
are already wasted.

1077
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:26,338
Think about it. Are you'tll sure?

1078
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,464
Yes.

1079
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:29,366
Fine then.

1080
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,241
Tommorrow morning we will leave.

1081
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:33,405
And you will take care
of the house.

1082
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,266
We are lucky. A function
is in progress here.

1083
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,495
We can take advantage of
the crowd and get in.

1084
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:58,396
And no one will notice us.

1085
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,244
Excitement! Excitement!

Something is the matter

Night is filled with vices

1095
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:11,435

Yeshwant! Look there.

1106
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:08,359
That man is Raj Thakur. And with
him is my Publisher Sofi.

1107
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,439
The arrow goes action

1108
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,334
ls it love or deception

1109
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,346
Why is any one faithful

1110
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:21,438
Heart was always crazy.

1111
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:25,350
The arrow goes action

1112
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:28,413
ls it love or deception

1113
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,482
Why is any one faithful

1114
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,387
Heart is. . -Sir, now you have
seen Sofi and Raj Thakur.

1115
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:35,418
So?

1116
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:39,398
So, we can use it
as our evidence.

1117
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:42,426
You are a lawyer. And
what are you talking?

1118
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,474
l am crazy

1119
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,503
Shut the door. They will see us.

1120
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,243
Excitement! Excitement!

Excitement! Excitement! -Let'ts

1127
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,444
Yes, Rubin, this better be good.

1128
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,470
Madam, not only in lndia.

1129
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,312
We are getting orders
for Greet the. .

1130
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:31,410
. .fox orders from Dubai,
US and London

1131
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,376
Good.

1132
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,352
What is the matter?

1133
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,220
You know from the moment Arjun
has gone to the jail.

1134
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:45,458
The sales of my novel have
gone up four times.

1135
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,368
His arrest has been really
good for my business.

1136
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,297
Wait till that Arjun to
gets life imprionment.

1137
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:56,434
Then watch your sales
will go eight times.

1138
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,380
He tried to cheat me.

1139
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:18,357
That face is not among them.

1140
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,425
The person you are telling
is McNamara.

1141
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,497
That lady told he is D'tsouza.

1142
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,309
There is no photograph of
the constable Gaikondae. .

1143
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:32,446
. .you are searching in the
police records of Goa.

1144
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:39,377
l think you must rectify
your story.

1145
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,418
Every criminal commits crime of
his real name and business.

1146
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,519
lt is very obvious Mr. Deshmukh
that Gaikondae and. .

1147
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,230
. .Mac must be his fake names

1148
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:50,388
Mr. Lawyer. .

1149
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,496
. .then why are you troubling
us behind these fake names?

1150
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:58,336
l think you are confused.

1151
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,470
Yes, yes, l am confused.

1152
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,479
l am very confused. l have
every reason to be confused.

1153
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,413
That how l am stuck
in this mess.

1154
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,349
But, you are not ready to accept
this conspiracy as conspiracy.

1155
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,421
Yes, that lady told that
man'ts name is D'tsouza.

1156
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:16,481
But his face and descripton
matches with McNamara.

1157
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:19,427
This man Gaikunde whom
we are searching. .

1158
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,328
. .l mean it could be
a fake cop, dammit.

1159
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,364
He is 100% / o with McNamara.

1160
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:27,367
Last night even after seeing
my Publisher Sofia.

1161
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:29,403
ln the arms of my
greatest enemy. .

1162
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:32,463
. .Raj Thakur we could
not do anything.

1163
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:36,433
But you know what is the
most confusing part. .

1164
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:40,345
Mr.Deshmuh, is what
are you doing here?

1165
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:42,440
l don't think you are
helping me one bit.

1166
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:47,312
Mr. Kapoor. .

1167
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,382
. .let us hope to
get some clues. .

1168
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,357
. .from Mr. Raj Thakur'ts
phone record.

1169
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:55,363
Because that is a last chance.

1170
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:04,463
Sir! Sir, take this file
of phone records. .

1171
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,372
. .of Mr. Raj Thakur'ts of
the last three months.

1172
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,471
What is the matter, sir? Why
do you need this file?

1173
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,406
Sorry, sir.

1174
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,251
Any luck? -Bad luck.

1175
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:57,415
You did not find anything
in Raj Thakur'ts record.

1176
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,324
There is nothing in this.

1177
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,361
Only the names of the girls. .

1178
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,488
. .he is currently romancing.

1179
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,399
Mr. Kapoor, l really
doubt you now.

1180
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:09,360
l don't know on basis of
what intelligence. .

1181
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,405
. .you have won so many cases?

1182
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,308
Do you have yellow pages?

1183
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:16,502
Yellow pages? What will
you do with that?

1184
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,243
Arjun feels that a strange
name like Macnamara. .

1185
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:22,441
. .might be among the
few people of Goa.

1186
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,342
We thought we could
look into it.

1187
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:29,447
Yellow pages! Fine. l will
get you the Yellowpages.

1188
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:34,361
l found only three
numbers. Try this.

1189
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,499
Can l talk to Mr. McNamara?

1190
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:42,403
When? -Can l speak to Mr. Vivian
McNamara? Sorry.

1191
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:53,243
This person is a Businessman
and he is out of town.

1192
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,405
No response.

1193
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,452
My first number was of a child.

1194
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,490
639241 . l have the address
of this number.

1195
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:05,359
ln this number l got a response.

1196
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,360
l guess we will have
to start from here.

1197
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:10,329
Tomorrow morning 8
O'tclock. Be ready.

1198
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,467
l am sorry. l am late. Let'ts go.

1199
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:18,464
Hello! Yes.

1200
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,499
Okay, l will reach there. -You
sit in the front seat.

1201
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:25,212
Something urgent work came

But, But Mr. lnspector what can
be more urgent than my case?

1203
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,383
Here my life is in a risk.

1204
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:34,488
You both go together. But, be
careful that no one notices you.

1205
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:37,252
And yes, come home directly.

1206
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,399
Yes? -Mr. Vivian McNamara?

1207
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:56,465
Yes, that'ts me.

1208
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,337
Tell me.

1209
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:04,249
Firstly you are searching
for a Vivian McNamar.

1210
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:07,483
Look, as a Doctor l meet
new patients daily.

1211
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:14,419
But, Raj Thakur does not
ring a bell here.

1212
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,331
l think you have come
investigating at a wrong place.

1213
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,391
Yes. Well, thanks Doctor.

1214
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,334
lf we could have spoken
this over the phone.

1215
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,304
We wouldn't have wasted
your time, today.

1216
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,341
But, really l tried to
call you yesterday.

1217
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:32,244
Well, as you can see l live
alone and l had gone on a call.

1218
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:34,472
That'ts why no one received
your call here.

1219
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,408
But anyways, in this reason. .

1220
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:39,215
. .l got the chance to
meet a famous lawyer.

1221
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:40,445
Well, thanks Doctor.

1222
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:47,494
l am sorry, baby but l am sure
we are missing something.

1223
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:49,489
l know but what can we do.

1224
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,459
All this is happening
because of that lady.

1225
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:57,437
Who? Whom are you talking about?

1226
01:27:58,373 --> 01:27:59,465
Sophia. And who else?

1227
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:04,439
lf she had not compelled me to
publish my name in this book.

1228
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,346
l would not have been
in this mess.

1229
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:12,217
ln your novel there is a
watermark of the name McNamara.

1230
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:14,378
ls that your pen name
or something?

1231
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:18,357
Of couse! l got it, babes. l got
it. lt is about the watermarks.

1232
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:19,483
The copy, which l had
given to Sophi. .

1233
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:21,290
. .had the watermarks
of McNamara.

01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,386
But you had burnt that copy.

1235
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,455
The copy l had burnt
was the X erox copy.

1236
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,233
The original copy is in Sophi'ts
publishing house.

1237
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,463
lf l get that copy l can walk
unscathed from this mess.

1238
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:33,338
We have to tell this is
Yeshwant. -At this hour?

of McNamara'ts name.

1244
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:51,324
l can prove my innocence
on the benefit of doubt.

1245
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:55,229
That manuscript is still lying
in publishing house.

1246

1371
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:08,407
He is the killer, your Honour.
He is the killer!

1372
01:44:08,475 --> 01:44:11,376
Does the defence lawyer have to
interrogate anything else?

1373
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:16,341
Considering all the evidence
and witnesses. .

1374
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:20,318
. .this court is releasing Munna.

1375
01:44:21,355 --> 01:44:24,324
A lawyer like you helped that
criminal to go out scot-free.

1376
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:32,355
Yashwant! Stop it!

1377
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,368
That day l decided. .

1378
01:44:36,336 --> 01:44:38,463
. .that l would kill every
such criminal lawyer. .

1379
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,373
. .who helped the criminals.

1380
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:48,380
So, l killed those five
criminal lawyers.

1381
01:44:49,516 --> 01:44:51,450
Then why were you behind me?

1382
01:44:51,485 --> 01:44:53,476
l had give up practicing
law long back.

1383
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:55,378
l knew that.

1384
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,321
l had come to kill you.

1385
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:02,318
Yes, of course. lt is a part
of being a criminal lawyer

1386
01:45:02,362 --> 01:45:05,331
. .and l am fed up. -Saw that
you wanted to change.

1387
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:08,325
So, l returned.

1388
01:45:10,337 --> 01:45:12,328
When l suddenly met you in Goa.

1389
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:20,413
l felt this could not
be coincidence.

1390
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:25,342
Thought, why not kill you today?

1391
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:32,223
l disguised Shinde as McNamara
and sent him to you.

1392
01:45:35,429 --> 01:45:39,456
The constable who was stopping
you at a Bunglow was also Shinde.

1393
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:45,363
My doubt was true.

1394
01:45:46,473 --> 01:45:48,373
You had not changed

1395
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:53,468
You were enjoying in other
writer'ts glory.

1396
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:57,407
And l was noticing all this.

1397
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:05,519
l got that book couriered in my
name to the police station.

1398
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:11,395
So that no one should
doubt me for. .

1399
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:13,489
. .reopening this
case in my name.

1400
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:17,437
Great! Superb!

1401
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:21,366
But you are forgetting
minor clues, Yashwant.

1402
01:46:21,508 --> 01:46:23,476
No publishing house was
ready to publish. .

1403
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:26,240
. .any book in the
name of Mcnamara.

1404
01:46:26,446 --> 01:46:28,380
So, l had to give my name.

1405
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:30,405
And how would l know how much. .

1406
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:32,418
. .money l would need
to publish the book?

1407
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:35,312
So, All the cheques l took
were in the name. .

1408
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:37,448
. .of McNamara Charity Trust.

1409
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:40,392
You should have found that out.

1410
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:47,231
And one more thing. l don't
need money and fame.

1411
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:49,394
Because l have both.

1412
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:53,501
And it would be better if
you surrender yourself.

1413
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:56,467
Who do you think you are?

1414
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:06,318
We had to hear your confession.

1415
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:09,386
lt is all over, Yashwant.

1416
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:15,419
Arjun, we got him.

1417
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,240
You haven't changed.

1418
01:47:39,352 --> 01:47:40,410
Brother!

1419
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:13,376
The Savior of the criminals
is back again.

1420
01:48:13,453 --> 01:48:16,445
Adocate Arjun has got
his license renewed.

1421
01:48:16,523 --> 01:48:18,388
High court has accepted
appeal in. .

1422
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:20,392
. .the litigation of
Sonam rape case.

1423
01:48:20,427 --> 01:48:24,363
And as its instruction Raj
Thakur was arrested from house.

1424
01:48:24,397 --> 01:48:26,490
Hey! Arjun ! Welcome back my boy.

1425
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:29,392
The case files are ready
before you arrived.

1426
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,370
There is a crowd of your
former clients.

1427
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:34,498
Tell, with whose case
will you start?

1428
01:48:35,442 --> 01:48:38,411
Sir, l have decided that l would
fight criminal'ts cases.

1429
01:48:39,246 --> 01:48:40,474
lf l fight it is only for truth.
