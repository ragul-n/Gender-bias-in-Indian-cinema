1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
'A man within me'

2
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,840
Brother.
We've reached

3
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,531
Brother,is a new party coming here today?

4
00:02:31,748 --> 00:02:32,605
Get down

5
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:47,428
- Get everything out of the vehicle.
- Why Brother?

6
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,083
Do whatever I say, unload them.

7
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:01,989
-Why brother?
-Hey,everything is over.

8
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:04,478
If you are leaving this,
then I'll take care, brother!

9
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,221
Do you want to get behind bars?
  10
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,002
If you tell others about our works...

10
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,360
I will kill you

11
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:23,899
Hey

12
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:29,177
Have it

13
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:30,782
Hold it

14
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:32,274
Make a living but of something else.

15
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:54,781
Is there any improvement?

16
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:57,391
His brain activities are getting
registered every now and then, that's it.

17
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:01,531
For how long will it
be the same?

18
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,775
I don't know

19
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:04,291
God only knows.

20
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,817
I need complete medical
report of patient...

21
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,381
right from the day
he was admitted

22
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,167
Okay.

23
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:15,207
This is Mr. Ranjith.

24
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:17,564
Special officer on duty,
Crime banch

25
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,437
He is appointed to
handle Vignesh's case

26
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:23,135
Sir.

27
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:25,143
Sir, we have worked on 
this case in-detail.

28
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:26,581
We'll wrap it off...

29
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:27,755
if we're given some more time

30
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:29,277
Paranjothi

31
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,563
Do you want this
case to get over?

32
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,807
Or under your leadership
in specific?

33
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,807
We're already under pressure

34
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,175
Hope you know

35
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,410
Don't be adamant,
please co-operate.

36
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:42,885
Ok Ranjith, you two carry on

37
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,646
Thank you, sir.

38
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,783
Hello, it's me
My phone got switched off.

39
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,300
Come soon to the
tea shop which I told...

40
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,765
Hey, I need to leave only after
selling pills to you.

41
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,913
Come soon

42
00:04:58,288 --> 00:04:59,866
Got it?

43
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:07,071
Hey.

44
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,524
Come here.

45
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,689
Yes sir, this guy looks odd

46
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,833
- Where are you going?
- My native, sir.

47
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,615
Who are they?

48
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,601
I don't know, sir.

49
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,140
Why do you laugh when I ask?
Call them

50
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,288
Call them, come here

51
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:32,412
Hey, stop!stop!

52
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:45,314
Hey , get up

53
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,908
Why are you running away
from us?

54
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:49,487
Sir, he was running away from us!

55
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:19,432
What's this?

56
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,012
I saw her for the first time that day

57
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:25,034
She was on a scooter
with her dad

58
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,106
I've never seen such a girl!

59
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:28,296
She looked like an angel!

60
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,084
Her dad was driving.

61
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:31,861
The bag she carried fell down

62
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,408
I rushed and got it back to her

63
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,916
Some cinema story!

64
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,234
This one?

65
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,406
Tell me

66
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,077
Where are they?

67
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,670
I'll come.
Wait

68
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:15,481
Sir, sir,sir!

69
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,270


70
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,734
You asked what this capsule is, isn't it?
Come on.

71
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:43,309
Is it ready, Micheal?

72
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:44,661
He is all yours sir!

73
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:46,716
Hmm, hmm

74
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,015
If you don't want to
be hit like him...

75
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,710
Give proper answers to what I ask

76
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,835
Water!

77
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:13,783
What's this?

78
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:18,665
Hmm

79
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,920
Lucia

80
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,906
My name is Vicky.

81
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:45,958
My father scolded that I'll be
ruined if I don't study well.

82
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,171
I left my home wanting
to move on Madras

83
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,949
We are four friends
sharing a room here

84
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,028
- One of us is working at the bar.
- 2 beer, 1 corn chips pack

85
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,265
Another at fast food restaurant

86
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:56,165
This guy takes care of the room

87
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:58,926
I'm working in
brother Durai's theatre

88
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:00,788
-Hey 
-Brother Durai belongs to my native...

89
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:02,713
he is affectionate on me

90
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,434
We'll work hard
and be very happy

91
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:07,528
All is going well.

92
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,687
Only thing is I don't 
get sleep at night

93
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:33,304
Go now!

94
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,537
Don't know how this day will be!

95
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:39,365
He told to wait here,
don't know when he'll come

96
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:42,187
Look, there's someone
standing over here

97
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:43,671
He has come,

98
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:45,562
Okay, I'll be back, bye

99
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,261
Hey.

100
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:50,502
Shall we go?

101
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:52,736
Say.

102
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:55,728
Come on!

103
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,223
Why are you hesitating?

104
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:58,879
Scared?

105
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:02,864
Why are you scared?

106
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:05,151
I came here to have tea

107
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:13,646
Boss.

108
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,000
boss, how much is it?

109
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:18,098
Why are you asking me?

110
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,363
O,Sorry, boss.

111
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:20,856
You were talking to her...

112
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,020
...and I thought you are a pimp!

113
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:25,543
if I talk to her...

114
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:26,817
...it means I'm a pimp?

115
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:27,966
Go away!

116
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,316
Sorry, boss.
Don't get angry!

117
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,340
Darling, shall we go?

118
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:37,949
Waiting for the customer, you go!

119
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,666
Don't I look loke a customer?

120
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,603
You'll take me, finish off...

121
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:44,533
...and say you don't have money

122
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,908
I've seen many like you!
Get lost!

123
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,522
Hey, what do you think of me?

124
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:49,702
Do you think I don't have money?

125
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:51,233
Look at this
See how much I've got

126
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:54,109
All bigger denominations!

127
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,109
Is it ok now?
Shall we move?

128
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:56,858
Boss.

129
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,698
Why don't you get
that money to me?

130
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,705
Is it ok now?

131
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:08,073
See the smell of fresh notes!

132
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:09,634
Thank you, boss.

133
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:14,023
Oh god, these guys

134
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:18,343
How many times should I warn you?

135
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:19,631

00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,068
Boss, don't panic

143
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,084
They would have got someone else by now

144
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,804
Go

145
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:19,502

146
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:22,043
Did you think of taking her?

147
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:25,714
Did you assume me of your kind?

148
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:28,687
I couldn't sleep,
and came here to drink tea

149
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:30,202
You can't sleep if you have tea

150
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,500
-I'm not at all getting sleep!
- What?

151
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,014
-Aren't you able to sleep?
-Hmm

152
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,186
Is it? What work you do?

153
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:39,272
In theatre

154
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,772
For how long have you
been suffering with this?

155
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,354
What?

156
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,978
Why do you question me
like a doctor?

157
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,142
Just tell me boss.

158
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:48,881
For a long time now.

159
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:51,028
So, it's then sleepless
nights everyday!

160
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,563
- Hmm
-Ok, come with me boss

161
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:55,497
Why?

162
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,075
Is it to put me
in trouble again?

163
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,466
Boss, come with me

164
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,825
I'll get you enough sleep

Huh?

166
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,965
Really?

167
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:04,770
Come on, boss.

168
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:08,769
Come 

169
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:09,973
Brother.

00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:13,714

-Went to wach second show movie, brother

172
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,577
Who is this guy ?

173
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:20,601
He's my friend!

174
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,983
He is working at the theatre

175
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,301
Why did you bring him here?

176
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,012
He is sleep deprived

177
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,551
That's why I brought him here

178
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:29,512
Come here
Did you tell him everything?

179
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:30,746
Yes, I told everything

180
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:32,340
Boss.

181
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,277
Wait for a while
I'll be back

182
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,280
Is he the one who'll
get me sleep?

183
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,171
It's not him
The person is inside

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,556
-Who's he then?
-He's just the priest

185
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:44,590
Where is the lord?

186
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,826
We're in front of
the shrine, be patient

187
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:51,736
Boss come. Come man.

188
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,885
Come on, boss.

189
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:11,899
 Brother.

190
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,760
Is he the lord?

191
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:15,523
Nowadays it's like this boss

192
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:20,647
Sit.

193
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,323
For how long have you been
suffering with this problem?

194
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,065
Problem?

195
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:29,221
What problem?

196
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:33,887
You said you're sleep
deprived, isn't it?

197
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:36,515
Oh, you all are referring
to that as a problem?

198
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:37,576
Hmm

199
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,910
It's there for quite some time

200
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,285
Very good!

201
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:44,408
I need people like you

202
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:47,121
What is it?

203
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:49,144
You talk like as
though you are recruiting!

204
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,426
- Hmm
- I'm not able to sleep

205
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,003
That's why he brought me here

206
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:56,576
Sleep.

207
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,107
A normal human...

208
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:00,473
 sleeps for 2 lakh hours in his lifetime.

209
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,351
Half of our life...

210
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,476
goes off in sleep!

211
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,010
Aren't you able to...

212
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,393
get such sleep?

213
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,963
You live a life when you are awake

214
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:14,598
How about having a life...

215
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,661
when you are asleep?

216
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:19,825
-I didn't get you?
- Do not get it?

217
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,093
Let me tell you clearly

218
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,957
I'll give you a medicine to sleep

219
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:29,829
If you consume it...

220
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:31,853
...you'll sleep 

221
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:33,712
...and get beautiful dreams as well

222
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:35,755
Dreams?

223
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:40,049
You'll get dreams about what
you like very much

224
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:41,770
It will be the same dream all the time

225
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,497


226
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,364
It will always be the continuity of
the same dream whenever you sleep

227
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,328
Whatever you wish to be...

228
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:53,859
...you can live the same
life in your dreams!

229
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,187
Hmm

230
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,099
First do something...

231
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,639
to get me some sleep

232
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:05,909
Consume this capsule

233
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:07,729
when you want to sleep

234
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:10,148
Think of the dream you want

235
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,351
Imagine that

236
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,698
Once you start consuming this,

237
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:16,900
you should not stop in between

238
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,964
If you do so...

239
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:21,105
...the dream you thought of
will start torturing you

240
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,316
Hmm

241
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,721
Take it.

242
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:30,810
It's all for you

243
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,968
I'll sleep if I consume
this capsule, isn't it?

244
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,038
Yes

245
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:37,542
Okay.

246
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:39,635
What's the name of this capsule?

247
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:06,697
Vicky.

248
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,168
Vicky.

249
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,276
Aren't you feeling well?
Shall we cancel?

250
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,183
No brother

251
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,410
I just came here
to get my costume changed

252
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:16,809
I fell asleep here

253
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,684
The cops have arrived
Shall I ask them to come here?

254
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:19,979
Yes, ask them to come

255
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:21,073
Ok

256
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:26,409
Sir.

257
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:31,431
Hello Mr.Vignesh

258
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,475
Hello.

259
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:33,679
Don't worry

260
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,740
It's very common for VIPs like you
yo receive such threat calls

261
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,351
We've tightened security
Everything will be ok

262
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,828

263
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,289

- Have they given security?
- Nothing, Vicky

265
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,864
They've just
stationed to constables

266
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,502
Sir,should I bring something
for him to eat?

267
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,721
- Whould you like to have something Vicky?
- No, nothing

268
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:01,971
Nothing

269
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:04,308
Shall we go?

270
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,658
Are they waiting for me?

271
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,352
If the shot is ready,
we shall move

272
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:08,796
Yes it's ready
We shall move

273
00:19:14,582 --> 00:19:15,442
Careful

274
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:24,798

- Goo morning, sir.

275
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,390

- Had good rest?
- Hmm

278
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:34,358
Where's master?

279
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:35,896
Master!

280
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,185
It's such a pleasure to working with you.

281
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:39,721
Ok, you carry on

282
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:44,044

283
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:47,161

Hey, aren't you going for job?

289
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:10,990
You've never slept like this

290
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,419
What happened?

291
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,500
"My heart felt desires
have come true"

292
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,000
"I'm growing on and on,
and it's cool!"

293
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
"Stepping into the entrance of heaven"

294
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,700
"Things all around
keep my life haven!"

295
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,000
"I keep wandering myself"

296
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
"Just as the deep water fishes
want themselves swimming!"

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,700

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
"Opening up new ways in life!"

302
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,000
"I've envolved on
the stage of this world"

303
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,000
"Making my presence on the moon!"

304
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
"The old trends and the new ones"

305
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,500
"I bring about an
art out of both!"

306
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
"Let the entire path
turn delighted"

307
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,500
"With the huge crowd of
fans thronging in"

308
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
"I keep myself wandering"

309
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
"Just as the deep water fishes
want themselves swimming!"

310
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,700
"The red carpet keeps me invited"

311
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,700
"With the bunch of flowers

ancient Tamil!"

319
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,372
What is this brother Durai?

320
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,583
There is no much crowd
even for morning show!

321
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:44,445
They are hardly ten people
in counter too

322
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,213
No one comes to theatre
for watching movie!

323
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,148
Everyone watch using pirated CD.

324
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:50,663
Don't talk like that brother

325
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,576
Our Raghvana talkies...

326
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,108
modernized every old stuff

327
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:55,896
Now they have people
thronging in.

328
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:59,236
Nobody will come here if you
don't renovate!

329
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:01,095
Hmm

330
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,260
I'm not financially
sound to get it done

331
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,986
Hmm

332
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:07,299
Hmm

333
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,756
The theatre has to be revamped

334
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:10,474
and we need more crowd coming in too!

335
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:15,162
Brother.

336
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:16,403
Shall I tell you an idea?

337
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:18,677
What is it?

338
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:19,723


339
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:21,441
Hit the screen with porn movies

340
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:23,450
You'll make good money!

341
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:30,652
- Get lost
- What brother?

342
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:31,355
Go.

343
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,222

- You don't know to survive!
- What happened brother?

346
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,482
- What is he saying?
- Don't shout!

347
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,821
- You may lose even these people
- Get lost first!

348
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:43,571
In the end, only you
two will be left

349
00:25:44,713 --> 00:26:43,884
You cannot escape from us
Give what we asked!

350
00:26:44,321 --> 00:26:45,453
Don't call me again

351
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:49,551
There seems to be some
problem in the engine

352
00:26:59,446 --> 00:27:00,743
I'm not sure of
what the problem is!

353
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,461
 You better come directly

354
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:05,719
Sir is waiting.

355
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:11,401
What happened?

356
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:12,917
Car breakdown issue

357
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:14,940
Ok, shall we go to my house?

00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:49,426
Be comportable
I'll freshen up and come back

368
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,362
Sorry, I made you wait
alone for long time!

369
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:46,557
It's ok

370
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,541
Okay, what would you like to have?

371
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:50,521
Nothing, I'm leaving

372
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:52,706
No, don't tell that

373
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,675
- have anything
- No

374
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:58,244
Oh

375
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:02,214
- Tell me brother.
- If your car broke down, you could have informed me immediately

376
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:03,848
Why did you go to her house?

377
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:06,819
Ok, I'm waiting outside

378
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,522
Yes, I'm coming brother

379
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:12,065
Car arrived. I'm leaving

380
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,830
Please stay, what's the hurry?

381
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:16,268
Next time.

382
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:18,589
One minute.

383
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:20,742
I feel bad that you are leaving...

384
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:21,773
...so early...

385
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,062
...on your first visit to my house!

386
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:29,022
I'll give you whatever you ask.

387
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:22,830
Look!

388
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:07,961
I can't

389
00:31:08,802 --> 00:31:10,919
If you can't, when will you
then repay your debts?

390
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:15,929
But, I can't give away this theatre to you

391
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:17,460
Durai

392
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:20,346
What's the use of having
a huge theatre in city's hotspot...

393
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,112
without making any profit?

394
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,991
Shall I suggest an idea?

395
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:27,379
I'' construct a shopping coplex here

396
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:29,348
I'll get you a security job in it

397
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:31,129
You can remain relaxed
throughout your life

398
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:32,496
What do you say?

399
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,480
No

400
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,809
This theatre was built by my father

401
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:41,386
It will remain the same

402
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,590
Hmm, is it sentiment?

403
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,074
These sentiments will never
workout in our life

404
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:47,799
We need money

405
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:51,252
How long will you keep me
waiting for the money?

406
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:58,688
Hey...

407
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:01,222
- Hey,leave him.
- He is watching us

408
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,393
He is working here in the theatre

409
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:06,743
Give me some time

410
00:32:07,274 --> 00:32:08,492
I'll somehow repay your money

411
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:09,588
How long?

412
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,643
Give me 2 months

413
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:13,173
I'll somehow repay the money

414
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,626
I'm leaving you now just
because you own this place

415
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:18,709
If not...

416
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,249
Hey, come on!

417
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:30,293
Who are they brother?

418
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:33,194
I got debts from him

419
00:32:33,726 --> 00:32:34,796
and made a film

420
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,311
I'm unable to release the movie

421
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,358
or repay the debt either!

422
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:41,857
He is asking for this theatre

423
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:43,568
instead of the money

424
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:47,059
This theatre...

425
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:48,652
...will be in excistence...

426
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:50,551
...until I'm alive

427
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:00,808


428
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:02,816
Wait for few minutes

429
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:04,370


430
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:07,683
I would have spent fifty bucks
and come by auto.

431
00:33:07,871 --> 00:33:08,980
Why are you troubelling me like this?

432
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,285
Are you going to get me married to a prince
saving that fifty bucks?

433
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,496
- Stop it, dad!
- What happened?

434
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:21,353
Wait, I'll take it and give

435
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:25,233
You were going at a very high speed

436
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:26,585
That's why it fell down!

437
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,913
- Thanks.
- Hmm

438
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,318
- Shall we start?
- Hmm

439
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:54,411
I've given pain killer
for the pain to subside

440
00:33:54,436 --> 00:33:56,483
Get the the dressing done for
once in two days

441
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:57,795
Take care

442
00:33:58,186 --> 00:33:58,959
Thank you, sir.

443
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,507
Did you receive any threat calls?

444
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:05,765
I received a call this morning

445
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:09,117
Sir, we've been telling about
threat calls all the time

446
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:12,010
 it's common for top film stars...

447
00:34:12,056 --> 00:34:13,150
to receive threat calls demanding money

448
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:15,620
What is it? We're panicking...

449
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:17,073
- ...but you point it very easy
- Brother.

450
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:19,931
Mr. Vignesh

451
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,381
Will you be able to
recognize the man who shot you?

452
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,920
- Sure
- Ok

453
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,693
I'll prepare the suspect list

454
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:26,998
We'll meet

455
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:28,037
Take care

456
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,209
Sir

457
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:34,736
Manage the media
persons outside

458
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:36,399
We'll leave through the back door

459
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:38,452
- You carry on, we'll take care
- Sir.

460
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:39,994
Sir, I have a request

461
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,978
Don't disclose that the incident...

462
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,736
...took place at the heroine house

463
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:46,583
It may give rise to unwanted issues

464
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:47,974
Hmm

465
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,812
We can't say anything about the case now

466
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:53,359
The case is under investigation

467
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,178
Vicky...!

468
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:09,514
Hello.

469
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:11,226
Sir, he's doing well sir!

470
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,405
We shall talk about
the dates later, sir

471
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:15,553
I'll come home, sir

472
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,567
Vicky

473
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:19,451
Media people are standing outside
We shall leave through the back door

474
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:27,580
Vicky.

475
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:30,039
We shall move on

476
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:22,242

Is she the heroine

00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:40,177
Come in

496
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:43,894
Hi Divya, take your seat

497
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,070
Idiot

498
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:54,413
Hey.

499
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,698
There is a girl in 'B' row

00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,721

Give it under my account

It seems like your sister has come!

504
00:38:03,143 --> 00:38:04,010


505
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,455
She's your sister!

506
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,657
Silly question
Brother.

507
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:09,504
Come soon
That girl has come

00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:12,332
- Which girl?

- Are you in love?
- Hmm

510
00:38:15,153 --> 00:38:15,723
Hey.

511
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,367
Does she know that?

512
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,703
I'll tell her later
You first come

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,283

See 

516
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,579
Where is she?

517
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,301
Which girl?

518
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:46,244
Hey

519
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,869
Vicky

520
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,651
That may be her brother!

521
00:38:57,646 --> 00:38:58,245
Hey

522
00:38:58,495 --> 00:38:59,216
What is it?

523
00:39:57,082 --> 00:39:59,168
if I find you going
behind her yet again...

524
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:01,402
I'll finish you off!

525
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:04,167
Cut.

526
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:07,674
Is the focus ok?

527
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,604
- Ya, ok sir
- Oh right, sir ...

528
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:11,167
- All right.
- Counters there?

529
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:13,548
-I'll call you once it's ready
- Ya ok, I'll wait

530
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,555
No way...!

531
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:24,554
Where is he?

532
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:25,702
I've sent for him
He'll come now

533
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:31,756
Hi sir!

534
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:34,264
Bring a chair

535
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:35,666
That's ok

536
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:36,656
Get it

537
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,085
Hold it

538
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:42,178
Bring the umbrella closer

539
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:53,833
- Bring the juice.
- Ok, sir.

540
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:57,467
- What's your name?
- Arvind sir.

541
00:40:58,226 --> 00:40:59,515
What were you doing before this?

542
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:01,233
Modelling

543
00:41:01,468 --> 00:41:02,444
Modelling?

544
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:03,904
Good money, right?

545
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,451
Not much!

546
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:07,403
You have good looking girlfriends?

547
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:08,911
No one, sir.

548
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,923


549
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:11,698
Really?
Or are you bluffing?

550
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:13,926
Really I don't have any girlfriends

551
00:41:14,153 --> 00:41:14,747
Hmm

552
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:17,525
Go now

553
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,064
Go fight properly

554
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:20,236
Ok, sir.

555
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:22,235
Give it

556
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:37,195
Ranjith.

557
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:38,078
Hmm

558
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,876
I've read it

559
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:40,642
There's nothing in that related
to this case

560
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,234
Do you have this girl's statement?

561
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:51,183
Yes

562
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:52,756
But she doesn't know
anything clearly

563
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:55,411
She was there when
the incident happened, that's all

564
00:41:56,495 --> 00:42:00,049
A person named Aruna in Mumbai
has been in Coma for 40 years

565
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:02,065
Even if she comes back...

566
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,030
She can't function normally

567
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,078
Because all her relatives heve left her

568
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:08,738
The supreme court
prevents Euthanasia

569
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,668
Because there's no rule in our law
for Euthanasia

570
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:12,641
No one has that right

571
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,830
Even he himself...

572
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:16,381
doesn't have the right to take away his life

573
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:18,390
But no one knows whether it is...

574
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:20,468
an accident, murder or sucide attempt

575
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:22,789
Sir.

576
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:24,406
The mediacal report says that

577
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,226
the content in the tablet...

578
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:27,499
is the same in the patient's blood

579
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,127
I wonder what the relation is
between the tablet and his case!

580
00:42:32,695 --> 00:42:33,914
First let's try to find out...

581
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,460
what that Lucia is

582
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,287
Brother! This is Murugan

583
00:42:37,614 --> 00:42:39,265
Tell me
Where is Sundaram?

584
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:41,324
Sundaram.

585
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,636
Aah...

586
00:42:43,347 --> 00:42:44,620
Sundaram has gone to his native

587
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,941
Native?
Tell me what's the matter

588
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:48,892
Brother! A new party...

589
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:50,861
They are well off...

590
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:52,502
They want to do some business

591
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:53,791
Shall I bring them?

592
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:54,931
How is the party?

593
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,689
They are very well off

594
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:01,090
Shall I bring them?

595
00:43:01,114 --> 00:43:02,645
Ok bring them

596
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,317
- Now hang up
- All right brother.

597
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:07,888
Let's go

598
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:18,115
Vicky.

599
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:20,598
Tomorrow morning song
shooting at AVM, I've confirmed

600
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,459
I said that we have song 
shooting at AVM tomorrow

601
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:36,884
Okay brother.

602
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:39,868
- Brother.
- Hmm

603
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:42,883
Did you enquire about this girl?

604
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:44,610
Yes

605
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,616
I'm enqiring

606
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,085
I'll let you know soon

607
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:51,205
So are you the groom?

608
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:54,002
Ah.

609
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:56,744
The women in this file

610
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,067
- What is your qualification?
- Have has studied till 10th grade

611
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:00,227
But he failed.

612
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:01,016


613
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,273
Ah.

614
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:03,680
The women in this file...

615
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:05,244
want an educated groom!

616
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:06,259
These will not match you

617
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,759
Where are you working?

618
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:09,345
He works in my theatre

619
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,528
What is his salary?

620
00:44:10,643 --> 00:44:11,503
3000 rupees

621
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:12,557
Daily?

622
00:44:13,953 --> 00:44:15,593
- Monthly!
- Bad!

623
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:17,142
The women in this file...

624
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,018

625
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,534
- This too won't work out
- Brother.

626
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:23,345
Search for a girl
that matches our status

627
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,504
For your status...

628
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:27,416
Check this out

629
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,213

See.

631
00:44:30,395 --> 00:44:31,910
- Problem means?
- Look.

632
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,152
When I say problem,
please don't worry

633
00:44:34,301 --> 00:44:36,949
I have arranged marriage for many
people with problem in their horoscope

634
00:44:37,163 --> 00:44:38,667
So far nothing has
happened to anyone

635
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:47,728
I like this one

636
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:49,484
- Liked her?
- Is it?

637
00:44:50,164 --> 00:44:51,640
Then we'll finalise this girl

638
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:53,559

639

640

642
00:44:58,593 --> 00:45:00,249
She doesn't have mom
Only father

643
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:02,007
Her father is a retired
government employee

644
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,046
The girl works in a pizza shop

645
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,186
Her sun sign is Taurus

646
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:07,726
Good looking one

647
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,326
Have you made all arrangements
for the birthday party this evening?

648
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Many rich customers will be coming

649
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,726
Treat them well
Only then we'll get future orders

650
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Then check if everything
on the menu card is fine

651
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:22,163
Excuse me

652
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:23,458

653
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Oh! Is that you?

654
00:45:24,684 --> 00:45:25,902
- Yeah it's me
- Why are you late?

655
00:45:26,668 --> 00:45:28,019
That...On the way...

656
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:31,018
Does Divya know that I'm coming?

657
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:32,252
It's ok come, It's getting late

658
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:43,650
Divya

659
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:45,259
Divya will come
You get ready first

660
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:46,931
Hey, get him ready

661
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:48,023
Okay, sir.

662
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,251
-Did you tell them that
I will do an item song?
- Hmm

663
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:04,554
Don't you know that I dont like it?

664
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:05,789
I'll not dance

665
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:07,230
You can!

666
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:09,551
Now choose one of these girls
to dance along with you

667
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:11,993
You know that
I don't like all these

668
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:13,711
So what's the point looking at these pics
I'll not dance

669
00:46:13,735 --> 00:46:16,063
You can dance Vicky
First take a look at the pics

670
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:23,007
How is it?

671
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:24,999
Can we pack up now?
Or are you going to dance?

672
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,593
Tell them I'll be there 
in 10 minutes

673
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:38,914
He'll come
Wait.

674
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,500
"I was myself"

675
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,500
"You intervened like a drop of honey
for a bee and stayed away"

676
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:10,500
"Why?"

677
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,700
"You were the apple,
that turned into the serpent"

678
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
"You were the deer, that
turned me into the devil"

679
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,500
"Why?"

680
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,200
"Why am I crazy about you?"

681
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,200
"Why have I lost all
my logical senses?"

682
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,000
"Why am I crazy about you?"

683
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,200
"Why have I lost all
my logical senses?"

684
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
"The love that I searched
for all my life is you"

685
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,000
"The cupid has already blessed
our destiny together"

686
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,700
"I feel that the time for
us to unite has begun"

687
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,000
"I want to spend every moment with you"

688
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,000
"And enjoy the sweetness
that you are sugar candy"

689
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
"I am an honored man
You are my queen"

690
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,500
"Why am I crazy about you?"

691
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,700
"Why have I lost all
my logical senses?"

692
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,700
"Why?"

693
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,700
"I long and live for you
I blossom everyday I see you"

694
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
"Why?"

695
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
"I want you live
within my eyes for eternity"

696
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,500
"And cherish you for
every blink of my eyes"

697
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,000
"I was myself"

698
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,700
"You intervened like a drop of honey
for a bee and stayed away"

699
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:14,000
"Why?"

700
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,497
Excuse me

701
00:50:18,422 --> 00:50:20,296
This costume suits you very well

702
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:22,318
All the kids enjoyed very much

703
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,334
Thanks

704
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:25,156
If you don't mind

705
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:26,711
Can we take a snap together?

706
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:27,984
Ok

707
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:32,658
Thanks

708
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:34,165
Listen.

709
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:35,098
One for me too

710
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:36,230
Okay.

711
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:44,520
Thanks

712
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:05,772
- Good girl.
- We can finalise

713
00:51:07,072 --> 00:51:08,353
She has grown up without a mother

714
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,432
I've pampered her a lot

715
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:11,898
Thank God!

716
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:14,632
If mom had grown her up
She would've grown more in height

717
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:22,163
Let the boy and girl
have a chat in private

718
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,695
- Err...!
- Let them talk

719
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:25,594
Yeah, with pleasure

720
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:30,005
Coffee was awesome

721
00:51:30,703 --> 00:51:32,984
Oops! That was not coffee
That was tea!

722
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:34,653
And I didn't make it

723
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,463
It was my neighbour

724
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,330
I don't know to cook

725
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:40,795
I cook nicely

726
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:43,088
Are you a cook?

727
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:45,304
Oh, no.

728
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,710
What do you do?

729
00:51:48,093 --> 00:51:48,897
I show way...

730
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:51,717
...to people in dark!

731
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:53,945
I didn't understand

732
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:55,628
I am a torch bearer
at the theatre

733
00:51:56,174 --> 00:51:57,059
What?

734
00:51:57,908 --> 00:51:58,822
Torch.

735
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:02,136
I'll show them
the way to their seats

736
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:03,815
Oh

737
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:06,206
I work at Durai sir's theatre

738
00:52:08,197 --> 00:52:08,925
Oh

739
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,020
Both of us...

740
00:52:12,778 --> 00:52:14,043
...can watch a movie for free always!

741
00:52:14,808 --> 00:52:15,512
Oh

742
00:52:17,164 --> 00:52:18,554
You use too much of 'Oh's!

743
00:52:24,737 --> 00:52:27,362
Looks like the girl liked you very much!

744
00:52:27,386 --> 00:52:28,776
You both were constantly giggling!

745
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:30,388
When did you see that?

746
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,850
- We saw.
- You were so busy talking
 that you didn't even notice me!

747
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:34,142
Come on brother!

748
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,009
- Oh! So is this blushing?
- Hey.

749
00:52:36,418 --> 00:52:38,012
Is this marriage look?

750
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:39,687
- Hey.
- Let's fix the marriage ...

751
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,187
on an auspicious day

752
00:52:41,212 --> 00:52:43,868
- Let's get thw information from the girl's side first
- They'll accept

753
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,059
See the time is good
The broker is calling us!

754
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:48,317
- Broker!
- Hello

755
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:50,202
Tell me

756
00:52:50,226 --> 00:52:51,918
What?

757
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:54,543
Haa

758
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:57,168


759
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,088
- What is the broker saying?
- What did he say?

760
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,671
He says we'll go and see
some other girl also

761
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:04,242
What does he say about this girl?

762
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,122
He says we'll see
Some other better girl

763
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:09,173
The girl didn't like him?

764
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:11,895
Yes!

765
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:17,455
Leave it! Is she the only girl?

766
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:20,072
I'll look for a better girl
and get you married to her!

767
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,868
- Let it go
- Do not worry.

768
00:53:22,024 --> 00:53:23,227
Don't get hurt

769
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,071
If not her...

770
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,640
...we'll get a better girl

771
00:53:40,938 --> 00:53:41,719
Hello.

772
00:53:41,873 --> 00:53:43,498
Hi Sir, I am Divya

773
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:44,755
Which Divya?

774
00:53:45,675 --> 00:53:48,354
Last week we did a song together

775
00:53:49,013 --> 00:53:49,885
Which song?

776
00:53:50,218 --> 00:53:52,022
The item song

777
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:56,388
I tought you are a dancer
Are you a singer too?

778
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:59,554
No sir
I don't sing

779
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:01,390
Tell me

780
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:02,814
Sir

781
00:54:03,048 --> 00:54:04,798
Can I meet you?

782
00:54:05,189 --> 00:54:06,103
What's the matter?

783
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:11,085
I came to know that you
selected me for that song

784
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:13,155
I want to thank you for that

785
00:54:13,395 --> 00:54:15,066
There is no need for formalities

786
00:54:15,472 --> 00:54:17,285
 We can meet, today itself

787
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:18,979
Ah.
Okay, sir.

788
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:21,018
- Thank you, sir 
- Yeah

789
00:54:21,502 --> 00:54:22,245
Bye.

790
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:29,015
Divya
Someone has come in search of you

791
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,560
Why has he come here?

792
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:35,937
You take care of this
I'll be back

793
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:38,663
Hi

794
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:39,976
What are you doing here?

795
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:42,749
I thought of meeting 
and talking to you

796
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:45,622
Tell me

797
00:54:46,038 --> 00:54:47,023
No.

798
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:49,930
We spoke nicely the other
day at your house

799
00:54:50,729 --> 00:54:52,330
But that broker...

800
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:54,057
Please can you sit here

801
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:55,558
If the customer keeps standing...

802
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:57,355
The manager will scold me

803
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:02,504
I know already...

804
00:55:02,942 --> 00:55:05,160
...that you liked me
the moment you saw me

805
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,138
It's that broker!

806
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,092
- I think he did it for a better commission
- Please order something

807
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:14,216
Manager.

808
00:55:21,224 --> 00:55:22,739
I've never eaten all these!

809
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:26,453
Oh, then shall I order?

810
00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:28,211
Huh

811
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:32,826
Hot Paper Passion.

812
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:33,990
Is this fine?

813
00:55:35,828 --> 00:55:37,342
Okay, I'll place the order and come

814
00:55:56,384 --> 00:55:57,852
The water is very chill

815
00:55:58,547 --> 00:55:59,562
Ice water.

816
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,315
The pizza I ordered...

817
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:07,862
...is Rs 610+tax

818
00:56:09,221 --> 00:56:11,111
Do you have money?

819
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:16,841
Because many people come here
without knowing about this place...

820
00:56:16,952 --> 00:56:18,373
...and suffer without
having enough money

821
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:20,069
That's why I asked you beforehand

822
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,877
In today's situation...

823
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:25,080
even small things
in these kind of shops are costly

824
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:27,965
I earn 8000 rupees per month

825
00:56:28,521 --> 00:56:30,911
I find it difficult to meet both
ends towards the end of the month

826
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:33,517
Leave it! That's my problem

827
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,314
Didn't you go to the theatre today?

828
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:38,907
Which movie is running?

829
00:56:39,717 --> 00:56:41,451
You watch films freely
everyday, isn't it?

830
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:42,395
Divya

831
00:56:44,445 --> 00:56:47,000
Your order is ready.
I'll get it

832
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:13,089
Hi sir.

833
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:16,680
Hi.
Please sit down

834
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,642
Thank you for accepting to meet me, sir.

835
00:57:24,037 --> 00:57:25,333
Please don't call me 'sir'!

836
00:57:25,864 --> 00:57:26,685
Why, sir?

837
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,410
My name is Vignesh

838
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:30,864
Call me Vignesh

839
00:57:31,351 --> 00:57:34,202
Sir, how can I call you
by your name!

840
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:37,483
Hmm
Vicky.

841
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:38,786
Isn't that easy?

842
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:42,058
Sir, you're a vert big star!

843
00:57:42,262 --> 00:57:44,801
If you keep calling me 'sir',
I will just leave!

844
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:46,693
Sit down now Vicky!
Is that fine?

845
00:57:51,873 --> 00:57:52,654
Hmm

846
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:57,052
- Sir , your order please!
- Isn't that place nice?

847
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:58,528
Can we go there and talk?

848
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:00,238
Sure

849
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:02,278
- Nothing.
- Thank you, sir.

850
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:14,962
Can I ask you something?

851
00:58:15,556 --> 00:58:16,306
Sure

852
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:18,516
I just want to know why.

853
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:20,581
Why you selected me for that song?

854
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,573
To be honost...

855
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:24,494
I saw you first in an ad

856
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:26,837
I asked for your details and nobody
got any information about you

857
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,666
It's a coincidence that I found your
photo among others at the shooting spot

858
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,720
I liked so I selected

859
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:34,260
Oh,really?

860
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:37,361
I did that ad just for fun!

861
00:58:37,828 --> 00:58:39,554
So you are not interested in acting?

862
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:40,889
No, it's not like that!

863
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:43,828
My dream is to be an actor

864
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,049
Ads are my hobby

865
00:58:46,549 --> 00:58:48,150
My aim is to become a cinema heroine

866
00:58:48,979 --> 00:58:51,049
My first movie itself is with you!

867
00:58:51,354 --> 00:58:52,549
I'm very lucky.

868
00:58:52,706 --> 00:58:54,205
Why are you so interested in acting?

869
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:56,643
Are you asking me this?

870
00:58:57,104 --> 00:58:58,495
I look at this life.

871
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,070
Look at the name and fame!

872
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:04,015
The tought that people will be talking
about us everyday makes me happy

873
00:59:04,616 --> 00:59:05,851
It's really boring!

874
00:59:05,994 --> 00:59:07,056
Boring?

875
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:09,642
Being a big star is boring?

876
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:11,580
Excuse me, sir ...

877
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,212
Can I have a photo with you?

878
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:14,873
-Sir, please, sir.
-We are talking.

879
00:59:14,928 --> 00:59:16,873
- Can we take it later?
- My girlfriend a big fan of yours, sir.

880
00:59:16,917 --> 00:59:19,548
Sir, she wants to take a photo with you!
Sir, please ...

881
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:21,338
- OK call her
- Lakshmi ... Come on ...

882
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:22,268
One second.

883
00:59:23,752 --> 00:59:25,690
Stand closer! Just stand closer!

884
00:59:27,573 --> 00:59:28,424
One more, sir!

885
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:31,680
- Thank you, sir.
- Hmm

886
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:34,984
Hmm, see?

887
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,866
I cannot spend time anywhere!

888
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:40,154
I don't have privacy
even for one second

889
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:41,732
That's why i said...

890
00:59:41,935 --> 00:59:43,044
...it's boring

891
00:59:43,656 --> 00:59:46,374
So far from now I'll
autograph on your behalf!

892
00:59:46,773 --> 00:59:48,257
Really.
Promise?

893
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:50,202
That's a wonderful idea
Thank you.

894
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:52,927
What else do you like?

895
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:55,312
For now it's this!

896
00:59:55,609 --> 00:59:56,788
I want to become a big actress!

897
00:59:57,022 --> 00:59:58,296
I want to be a star

898
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:00,672
We'll see everything else after that

899
01:00:01,085 --> 01:00:02,100
Excuse me, sir

900
01:00:03,287 --> 01:00:04,788
Can I take a picture with you?

901
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:05,725
Who with me?

902
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:07,127
Do you know who she is?

903
01:00:07,225 --> 01:00:09,205
- That's Divya. The next big star
- What?

904
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,542
-Take a picture with her! come!
- Hey.

905
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:11,628
I'll take a photograph. Come
Stand properly

906
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,550
Come on ...
Just stand.

907
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:14,831
Come on ...
Stand.

908
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:16,096
Ready ...

909
01:00:16,253 --> 01:00:18,276
One, two, three, Smile!

910
01:00:28,463 --> 01:00:29,392
Hello...?

911
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,494
I...!

912
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,985
I came here to apologise!

913
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:41,971
It was a mistake to have
asked you to marry me!

914
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:43,784
I am sorry!

915
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:46,080
It was the mediator...

916
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:49,033
That's why I brought my parents!

917
01:00:51,205 --> 01:00:53,025
I work in a theatre

918
01:00:54,048 --> 01:00:56,267
I shouldn't even
think of girls like you!

919
01:00:57,551 --> 01:00:58,449
I am sorry!

920
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:04,679
I have something as your rememberance

921
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:06,796
It want to give it back.

922
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,193
There is nothing that is wrong in this

923
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:20,176
I'm sorry

924
01:01:21,406 --> 01:01:22,343
I'll go.

925
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:14,869
You both be somewhere near

926
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,492
I'll alert you if there is a problem

927
01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:17,648
And then you can come

928
01:02:22,433 --> 01:02:24,160
Do what we say!
Did you understand?

929
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:25,566
Shall we?

930
01:04:25,566 --> 01:04:27,730
Hey, Smile nicely and pose!

931
01:04:27,755 --> 01:04:28,996
Enough of caressing!

932
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:29,980


933
01:04:31,098 --> 01:04:32,403
Come this side!

934
01:04:33,684 --> 01:04:34,496
He is the one

935
01:04:35,432 --> 01:04:36,206
Hello.

936
01:04:36,253 --> 01:04:38,401
Welcome! I am Vajravel
MD of company

937
01:04:38,635 --> 01:04:39,932
One minute

938
01:04:41,026 --> 01:04:41,994
Hey.

939
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:45,291
Enough! Don't jeep
caressing her!

940
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:46,947
Smile, girl

941
01:04:46,971 --> 01:04:50,111
Hey Nisha! You have a nice hip
Show it liberally!

942
01:04:50,502 --> 01:04:51,830
- Ok, sir!
- See you at night!

943
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:53,997
Why are you so dull?

944
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:55,262
Oh...

945
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:57,707
Before...After...

946
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,230
We can see it later

947
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:01,651
- Come ...
- Definitely.

948
01:05:01,676 --> 01:05:02,917
Before...after

949
01:05:04,308 --> 01:05:05,496
Come....Come
Welcome

950
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,807
Hey.

951
01:05:07,901 --> 01:05:08,748
Get out

952
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,092
Sir, coffee?

953
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:14,514
- No!
- Whiskey? 

954
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,920
Or Nisha?

955
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,266
Do not worry that you are old

956
01:05:19,306 --> 01:05:22,362
We have something special for you!

957
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:23,206
No thanks!

958
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:24,517
Just joking!

959
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:26,705
Tell me what can I do for you, sir.

960
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,462
I run the business of
supplying canned water!

961
01:05:30,038 --> 01:05:32,709
When I wanted to do
some other business

962
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,791
I came to know about you!

963
01:05:34,815 --> 01:05:36,627
Suggest some business
where we can make a lot of money

964
01:05:37,161 --> 01:05:38,840
You must have noticed just
as you entered our company...

965
01:05:39,028 --> 01:05:41,168
...we have a lot of products!

966
01:05:41,636 --> 01:05:43,636
Weight loss, hair loss

967
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,441
Color problem, skin problem.
Sexual problem

968
01:05:46,466 --> 01:05:48,980
We have products for all these

969
01:05:49,262 --> 01:05:49,996
Sir.

970
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:52,335
All these products are already
available in market

971
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:54,984
If we do the same
how much we can sell?

972
01:05:55,978 --> 01:05:57,226
Do you have anything new?

973
01:05:59,948 --> 01:06:01,971
- Did Murugan tell anything?
- No.

974
01:06:04,354 --> 01:06:05,854
I have something...

975
01:06:06,423 --> 01:06:07,423
...that is not available anywhere

976
01:06:07,579 --> 01:06:09,477
Special!

977
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:14,263
Lucia.

978
01:06:14,785 --> 01:06:16,113
The dram pill

979
01:06:17,029 --> 01:06:18,763
Lucia?
What do you mean?

980
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:21,419
Like what you do want to live.

981
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:24,804
In your dreams, you can live
the life that you always wanted

982
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:27,374
Why should live in a dream?

983
01:06:27,628 --> 01:06:29,795
Who is living their
own lives here?

984
01:06:30,502 --> 01:06:33,627
Everyone looks at someone
and wants to live like them!

985
01:06:33,711 --> 01:06:34,641
For example

986
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:39,009
The guy in this house ogles
at the wife of the next door guy!

987
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,822
That guy ogles at
this guy's wife

988
01:06:42,423 --> 01:06:46,618
This is a blessing for all those
who have dreams like that!

989
01:06:47,064 --> 01:06:47,954
Lucia.

990
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:49,266
The dream pill

991
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:52,500
It's a very addictive pill

992
01:06:59,244 --> 01:07:06,619
'The girlfriend of Vignesh, was arrested
when she attempted to murder him"

993
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:10,470
'In a state where we do not have
an answer why Vignesh in this state...'

994
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:15,329
Hello.

995
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,698
Ranjith, the case is over

996
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,932
Vignesh's girlfriend tried
to kill him anf got caught!

997
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,033
Now stop researching on this medicine
and come here

998
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,936
- I can't come now
- What more do you want?

999
01:07:25,022 --> 01:07:27,178
I'm going to close the case!
Come fast

1000
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,591
- Is everything ok, sir?
- Nothing!

1001
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:34,433
Lucia.

1002
01:07:40,451 --> 01:07:41,584
Okay bye.

1003
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:44,024
Hi Vicky.
How come you've come this far!

1004
01:07:44,196 --> 01:07:47,297
- Oh! I shouldn't have come? Ok,bye!
- Come inside!

1005
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:50,226
You've come to my house...

1006
01:07:50,711 --> 01:07:51,960
Shouldn't I come to your house?

1007
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:58,461
Compared to your house...
sorry, palace... is this a house?

1008
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:00,838
It's good.
It's a beautiful house!

1009
01:08:01,505 --> 01:08:04,950
Why are you shooting all this?

1010
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:06,168
Hmm...Hmm
I'll tell you

1011
01:08:06,504 --> 01:08:08,379
Can I have some water first?

1012
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:09,652
Sorry! Wait here!

1013
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:23,684
It's ambarrasing!

1014
01:08:23,988 --> 01:08:25,497
Can you shut down the camera?

1015
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,375
Feeling shy!

1016
01:08:27,844 --> 01:08:30,953
- You wanted to act! That's why! It's a small audition!
- Audition?

1017
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:33,215
I have not applied any makeup!

1018
01:08:33,551 --> 01:08:35,153
Hey! No need of any makeup

1019
01:08:35,326 --> 01:08:36,184
Let it be as it is!

1020
01:08:36,606 --> 01:08:37,621
It's an experimental film!

1021
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,353
Really? What's the story?

1022
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:41,962
Story?

1023
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:46,170
A normal guy who works
in an old theatre...

1024
01:08:46,758 --> 01:08:51,124
falls in love with a beautiful
girl who works at a Pizza shop

1025
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:53,280
Why would a girl working in a Pizza shop
fall for a guy who works at a theatre?

1026
01:08:56,606 --> 01:08:58,301
Why? Shouldn't they fall in love?

1027
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,331
Girls usually fall in love
with rich guys, isn't it?

1028
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,548
Why?

1029
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:06,039
Isn't heart enough...

1030
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,335
...to fall in love?

1031
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:10,145
You need a heart!
But is that enough?

1032
01:09:11,268 --> 01:09:12,166
What else do you need?

1033
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:13,953
There are lots of things!

1034
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:18,499
Super! super! super!

1035
01:09:18,794 --> 01:09:19,982
This is what I expected!

1036
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,153
The female perspective

1037
01:09:22,543 --> 01:09:25,168
Can we write the story together?

1038
01:09:25,768 --> 01:09:27,135
That's interesting!

1039
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:29,151
-Ok! Done!
- Done?

1040
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:31,151
Superb!

1041
01:09:31,448 --> 01:09:32,479
Writer madam

1042
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:34,002
Hey...

1043
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,046
Come and take a look at this

1044
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
"A flower bloom"

1045
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,016
Hey

1046
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
"Gives a thousand dreams"

1047
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
"In all those dreams"

1048
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
"The same moon traverses through"

1049
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:23,000
"With her bright smile
She showers light"

1050
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:33,000
"I feel like a cloud"

1051
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:44,000
"A cloud that showers flowers"

1052
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
"In the passage of
my breath, traverses your song"

1053
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
"And the music that comes out
Fills my heart with ecstasy"

1054
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:59,600
"In the passage of
my breath, traverses your song"

1055
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
"And the music that comes out
Fills my heart with ecstasy"

1056
01:11:18,599 --> 01:11:20,067
Shall I talk to the girl alone?

1057
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:26,561
I show them the way to their seats

1058
01:11:26,737 --> 01:11:31,000
"The moon comes over the clouds"

1059
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:36,561
"She comes over my heart"

1060
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,000
"With her white wings
She holds my hands"

1061
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
"Covering my eyes
She takes me on a dream"

1062
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:58,000
"I'm filled with ecstasy"

1063
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:08,000
"I am being showered with flowers"

1064
01:12:09,737 --> 01:12:12,000
"A flower bloom"

1065
01:12:14,737 --> 01:12:18,000
"Gives a thousand dreams"

1066
01:12:19,737 --> 01:12:23,000
"In all those dreams"

1067
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
"The same moon traverses through"

1068
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Get me the tube light!

1069
01:12:37,249 --> 01:12:38,514
Which tube light?

1070
01:12:47,387 --> 01:12:49,722
Are you showing off just
because she is here?

1071
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:54,534
Okay, you guys have a chat

1072
01:12:54,861 --> 01:12:55,673
I'll be back

1073
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,161
I've applied some medicine
It'll be alright

1074
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,402
Sorry!

1075
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:09,580
Why do you say sorry?

1076
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:11,354
I fell off the ladder

1077
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:13,424
- It's not your fault 
- Not for that

1078
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:17,910
The other day when you came
to the Pizza shop, I hurt you by my words

1079
01:13:18,386 --> 01:13:19,276
I'm sorry for that!

1080
01:13:19,757 --> 01:13:20,799
Oh that one?

1081
01:13:21,471 --> 01:13:23,564
- I was thinking of...
- Do you love me?

1082
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,183
I never said that

1083
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:28,512
So you don't love me?
Okay, I'll go.

1084
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:29,825
Wait!

1085
01:13:31,314 --> 01:13:33,337
Yes, I love you

1086
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:41,263
Then answer my questions properly!

1087
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,179
Before that...

1088
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:46,678
- Shall I tell you something?
- What is it?

1089
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,424
On seeing you today...

1090
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:56,713
I was happy as seeing the crowd
on Rajinikanth's movie release!

1091
01:13:58,692 --> 01:13:59,770
Now you may ask

1092
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:05,244
Other than this job
what else do you know?

1093
01:14:12,888 --> 01:14:14,631
Enough! Enough!

1094
01:14:15,502 --> 01:14:18,899
I don't like you working
in this theatre

1095
01:14:19,881 --> 01:14:20,897
Do not say that!

1096
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:23,724
This theater was built
by Durai sir's father!

1097
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:24,970
That's not theatrey...

1098
01:14:25,478 --> 01:14:26,321
That's THEATRE!

1099
01:14:26,673 --> 01:14:28,540
- Theatrey...
- THEATRE!

1100
01:14:28,626 --> 01:14:29,508
Theatrey

1101
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:32,429
Okay.
Aamm...

1102
01:14:33,031 --> 01:14:34,335
Do you have some good clothes?

1103
01:14:36,627 --> 01:14:38,377
I have two checked shirts like this

1104
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:39,876
I have a pink colored one

1105
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,349
Then...do you have
one in yellow?

1106
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:46,527
- You need to be changed!
- What?

1107
01:14:47,832 --> 01:14:50,535
I can't introduce you to my friends
the way you are now!

1108
01:14:51,173 --> 01:14:52,071
That's why.

1109
01:14:52,759 --> 01:14:54,180
- Why?
- Leather.

1110
01:14:54,395 --> 01:14:55,848
They would think
that I'm crazy

1111
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:57,237
- Brother
-Huh?

1112
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,158
Come fast
The reel need to be changed

1113
01:14:59,683 --> 01:15:00,698
Coming! Coming!

1114
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:04,674
When will you learn all these?
I have to keep doing all these!

1115
01:15:04,699 --> 01:15:06,628
Each one has to do their job

1116
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:08,465
You make me do the job!

1117
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:26,209
I thank you all for coming
to this press meet regarding the movie 'Pattinam'

1118
01:15:26,296 --> 01:15:27,973
You may ask questions now.

1119
01:15:28,764 --> 01:15:30,905
Vignesh sir, you say that
this is a different movie?

1120
01:15:30,928 --> 01:15:32,247
How different is it?

1121
01:15:33,607 --> 01:15:34,505
Hello.

1122
01:15:34,771 --> 01:15:35,521
Aamm...

1123
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:37,987
It's not good to talk about
the role in this press meet

1124
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:40,237
The surprise element would be lost
if I talk about the role

1125
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,841
It's a suspense thriller

1126
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:43,724
You can watch the movie
in theatres to know more about it

1127
01:15:44,185 --> 01:15:46,435
Ma'am.
Will you dub for yourself at least in this movie?

1128
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:50,869
I'm not fluent in Tamil yet!

1129
01:15:51,065 --> 01:15:51,666
But...

1130
01:15:51,799 --> 01:15:53,393
Surely I will
try in future

1131
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,841
There is a talk in industry that
some of your previous films...

1132
01:15:57,013 --> 01:15:58,255
...didn't do well commercially
What's your opinion?

1133
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:01,517
Do you know what my last movie is?

1134
01:16:01,915 --> 01:16:03,071
'Kadhal solla neram illai'

1135
01:16:04,304 --> 01:16:05,983
Do you know the budget of that movie?

1136
01:16:07,006 --> 01:16:08,732
Do you know how much
the film collected returns?

1137
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:11,060
Do you know how much we sold
the satellite rights for?

1138
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,278
Don't specculate without
knowing the facts

1139
01:16:13,371 --> 01:16:14,917
- It is not like that...
- Let it be

1140
01:16:15,214 --> 01:16:16,823
You've come for the press meet of 'PATTINAM'

1141
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,119
Let's talk about that

1142
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:18,986
Next question.

1143
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,455
Director Sir.

1144
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:23,236
Won't you work on village subjects?

1145
01:16:23,799 --> 01:16:24,924
No.

1146
01:16:25,072 --> 01:16:27,213
I'm making films on the subjects
that I know and am familiar with

1147
01:16:27,637 --> 01:16:29,698
That doesn't mean that I won't
do any village subject

1148
01:16:29,723 --> 01:16:31,949
I will do when the times comes
Thank you.

1149
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:35,635
There is a talk that you are in love
with the upcoming actress Divya

1150
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:37,675
It is also said that you are
helping her find roles for movies

1151
01:16:37,869 --> 01:16:39,198
What's your opinion about this?

1152
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:41,112
What's your problem?

1153
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,643
Why do you ask unwanted questions?

1154
01:16:43,945 --> 01:16:45,390
We have all come here for
the press meet of PATTINAM

1155
01:16:45,414 --> 01:16:47,109
It's a good movie
Let's talk about it

1156
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,134
If we ask about the movie you say
that the suspense would be lost

1157
01:16:50,275 --> 01:16:51,509
You get angey if we ask about you
What else should we ask?

1158
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:54,181
- Are you married?
- Yes.

1159
01:16:54,392 --> 01:16:56,794
-Is it love marriage or arrange marriage?
- Arrange marriage

1160
01:16:58,158 --> 01:16:59,728
With how many girls you
 have roamed before marriage?

1161
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,279
Why are you poking your nose
into my personal life?

1162
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,484
So it's personal only for you?
Don't we have our own personal?

1163
01:17:04,737 --> 01:17:05,807
You are a celebrity

1164
01:17:06,026 --> 01:17:08,322
Being a celebrity does that
mean that you can ask anything?

1165
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:13,285
Why do all the journalists
in all the press meets ask unwanted questions?

1166
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:15,690
What do you all want?

1167
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:18,447
Am I speaking unwanted things?

1168
01:17:18,471 --> 01:17:20,174
Now what's your problem?

1169
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,322
What's the problem?
What do you all want to know now?

1170
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:24,017
Yes, I love that girl

1171
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,118
And she too loves me
Is that enough?

1172
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:27,532
Write whatever you want

1173
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:29,110
Nonsense!
1175
01: 17: 33.313 -> 01: 17: 34.485
Move.

1174
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:43,280
How long have you been working in the theatre?

1175
01:17:44,898 --> 01:17:46,202
3 years

1176
01:17:48,147 --> 01:17:49,232
Doyou speak English?
1179
01: 17: 51.466 -> 01: 17: 52.114
Ha

1177
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:54,294
- English.
- Why do you want to join here?

1178
01:17:55,372 --> 01:17:58,691
I  hold the torch at
Durai sir's theatre
1182
01: 17: 58.980 -> 01: 18: 00.230
 Speak in English.

1179
01:18:03,191 --> 01:18:04,089
I...

1180
01:18:04,682 --> 01:18:05,550
Aah...

1181
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:07,666
Durai talkies

1182
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:10,024
Aah...
Torch...see...

1183
01:18:10,314 --> 01:18:13,173
Durai sir talkies...torch...see

1184
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,750
- Mother...I...
- You're saying cinema is like your mother?

1185
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,586
Han
Yes.

1186
01:18:19,078 --> 01:18:21,867
I asked why you left that
theatre and come here?

1187
01:18:21,984 --> 01:18:23,163
Divya said so I came

1188
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:24,576
How do you know Divya

1189
01:18:25,116 --> 01:18:26,131
I love you!

1190
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,092
What?

1191
01:18:27,545 --> 01:18:28,646
Divya

1192
01:18:29,303 --> 01:18:30,131
I love you!

1193
01:18:30,631 --> 01:18:31,342
Divya

1194
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:34,419
I'll let you know

1195
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:36,443
- Huh?
- I'll let you know

1196
01:18:36,955 --> 01:18:37,759
I'll tell you

1197
01:18:41,387 --> 01:18:42,215
Come, let's go

1198
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:46,273
What? Won't I get
the job for sure?

1199
01:18:47,043 --> 01:18:48,746
How much is the salary?

1200
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:51,002
Who asked you to
talk in English?

1201
01:18:52,865 --> 01:18:53,893
That men told me

1202
01:18:54,921 --> 01:18:56,833
First you need to be sent
to English class

1203
01:18:57,663 --> 01:18:58,709
What?

1204
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:00,075
Do what I say!

1205
01:19:00,224 --> 01:19:03,583
If you know English, you can work anywhere!

1206
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:04,816
Understand?

1207
01:19:07,752 --> 01:19:09,338
What did you tell him about me?

1208
01:19:11,044 --> 01:19:12,560
I said 'I love you Divya'

1209
01:19:12,841 --> 01:19:14,434
Isn't how we say about
the girl whom we are gonna marry?

1210
01:19:15,468 --> 01:19:17,077
Did I ever tell you
that I will marry you?

1211
01:19:19,906 --> 01:19:20,945
First learn English

1212
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,195
And find a good job

1213
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:23,554
Then we'll see

1214
01:19:27,088 --> 01:19:28,220
Do not comb your hair like this

1215
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,478
It's horrible

1216
01:19:34,343 --> 01:19:36,562
Vicky, you discuss with them

1217
01:19:36,796 --> 01:19:38,655
I feel nervous

1218
01:19:40,547 --> 01:19:41,585
Oh, Vicky.
1223
01: 19: 41.726 -> 01:19:44,445
You ask everything like the days
of shooting,story and everything

1219
01:19:44,515 --> 01:19:45,725
- Right?
- Hmm

1220
01:19:46,554 --> 01:19:47,296
Vicky.

1221
01:19:47,614 --> 01:19:49,395
They have come

1222
01:19:53,901 --> 01:19:54,675

1223
01:19:54,785 --> 01:19:56,190

1224
01:19:56,471 --> 01:19:57,269
Come in

1225
01:19:58,713 --> 01:20:01,041
Technicians and other artists are ready

1226
01:20:01,314 --> 01:20:02,899
- We're waiting for you
- Ok

1227
01:20:02,992 --> 01:20:04,423
- When are you planning to start?
- Weekend.

1228
01:20:04,626 --> 01:20:06,696
Oh

1229
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:09,344
Vicky

1230
01:20:10,446 --> 01:20:11,992
- This is Aravind.
- Hi, sir.

1231
01:20:12,461 --> 01:20:16,084
This is Kodhandaraman, my producer

1232
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:16,084
- Pleaes sit down

1233
01:20:17,976 --> 01:20:18,999
Vicky

1234
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:21,425
Aravind has done modelling with me

1235
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,371
Divya, I know sir before

1236
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:25,574
- I've acted with him in a movie
- Oh.

1237
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,230
Vicky

1238
01:20:29,336 --> 01:20:32,125
Aravind wants me to be
the heroine in his movie

1239
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:36,586
Sir, I've known Divya from our modelling days,
that's why

1240
01:20:38,453 --> 01:20:39,469
Mr Aravind.

1241
01:20:40,589 --> 01:20:42,179
Divya will not act in your movie

1242
01:20:51,622 --> 01:20:53,121
All you need is a heroine right?

1243
01:20:54,176 --> 01:20:55,122
You do one thing.

1244
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,276
Contact my management.

1245
01:20:58,171 --> 01:20:59,218
He is very resourceful

1246
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,616
He will find the apt
heroine for your project

1247
01:21:02,174 --> 01:21:03,361
- Go.
- Sir.

1248
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,143
I will come as the chief guest
for your audio release

1249
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:07,073
All the best
It will be a big hit

1250
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:12,762
Why are you standing here Divya?

1251
01:21:13,341 --> 01:21:14,582
Go get ready...we'll go outside

1252
01:21:16,077 --> 01:21:17,406
Why did you do like this Vicky?

1253
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:20,414
Don't you know how much
I yearn to act as a heroine?

1254
01:21:20,765 --> 01:21:22,406
I sn't my career important to you?

1255
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:23,772
Be patient Divya

1256
01:21:24,155 --> 01:21:25,467
Are you going to act with that guy?

1257
01:21:25,835 --> 01:21:27,624
I'll get you involved
in a good project, ok?

1258
01:21:27,872 --> 01:21:29,217
You always keep saying this

1259
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:30,621
Why  are you doing this to me?
1265
01: 21: 31.031 -> 01: 21: 32.710
You'll understand later
why i'm saying all this

1260
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:33,945
Go get ready.

1261
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,585
Then this film?

1262
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:39,095
Don't keep talking the 
same stuff Divya

1263
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:01,219
Why do you sleep
during class hours?

1264
01:22:02,907 --> 01:22:03,875
Don't hit Divya!

1265
01:22:04,172 --> 01:22:05,531
Divya!
What's this dear?

1266
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:06,968
Why do you hit him?

1267
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:08,155
Look uncle.

1268
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:10,811
I stuggled a lot to save money
and send him for coaching class...

1269
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,484
...and he sleeps there!

1270
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,033
Why man?

1271
01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:17,478
You can learn English and
talk to our customers in English!

1272
01:22:18,126 --> 01:22:18,962
Brother.

1273
01:22:19,176 --> 01:22:20,965
She wants me to learn English....

1274
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:22,645
...not to talk to our customers!

1275
01:22:22,889 --> 01:22:25,232
It is to work in that multiplex

1276
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:26,795
Tell him!

1277
01:22:28,946 --> 01:22:30,165
You always hit me

1278
01:22:30,392 --> 01:22:32,009
- Multiplex?
- Yeah

1279
01:22:32,235 --> 01:22:34,578
If I go, who will take care
of all the works here?

1280
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:37,326
Canteen Kumar will be blink if you ask for
the number of puffs and cool drinks sold!

1281
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:39,810
What will you do if I leave?

1282
01:22:43,808 --> 01:22:46,128
Leave it
Go get some juice for her
1289
01: 22: 47.669 -> 01: 22: 48.856
What?

1283
01:22:49,606 --> 01:22:50,621
Brother.

1284
01:22:50,794 --> 01:22:52,271
What has happened to you?

1285
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:55,747
She hits me like anything and you
ask me to get juice for her!

1286
01:22:58,134 --> 01:23:00,724
- Go now!
- It's not right!

1287
01:23:06,808 --> 01:23:07,584
Uncle

1288
01:23:08,129 --> 01:23:09,426
You tell me

1289
01:23:09,895 --> 01:23:12,801
What can he do with just
Rs 3000 salary?

1290
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:15,728
If he earns well only
we can be happy

1291
01:23:16,055 --> 01:23:18,353
You also wish for
the same thing isn't it?

1292
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,252
What you're saying is right!

1293
01:23:23,877 --> 01:23:28,642
Since I've been like this,
I never thought of him

1294
01:23:31,395 --> 01:23:33,106
Do what you feel is right!

1295
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:35,778
My life has become like this!

1296
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:39,536
At least let him be happy!

1297
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:41,974
Divya, wait

1298
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,615
I'll learn English

1299
01:23:43,771 --> 01:23:44,982
I'll go and work at the place you tell me

1300
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,325
What the F**k, man!
Wait Divya! Don't go

1301
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,751
- Come inside
- What did you say?

1302
01:23:53,169 --> 01:23:54,181
I told you to come inside

1303
01:23:55,518 --> 01:23:57,557
Before that
What The...

1304
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
What the F**k, idiot, A****,fool

1305
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:03,001
There are many things like this.
You come inside

1306
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,140
Where did you learn this?

1307
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:07,108
The school kids near my
room talk like this

1308
01:24:09,734 --> 01:24:10,554
- Hi.
- Hi.

1309
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,570
- Why did you ask me to come here Divya?
- Let's go

1310
01:24:13,614 --> 01:24:14,528
Who is this?

1311
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:17,168
Aravind this is Vicky
Vicky this is Aravind

1312
01:24:17,193 --> 01:24:18,302
Hi Vicky.
How are you?

1313
01:24:20,224 --> 01:24:20,755
Go.

1314
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,106
Divya

1315
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:31,873
You said you'll never come near this theatre

1316
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,728
If the movie is good,
one can come!

1317
01:24:35,353 --> 01:24:38,001
Leave that. How are you?
It's been a long time since we met

1318
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,882
Yeah, I'm fine

1319
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,437
Keep in touch with 
your old friends!

1320
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,565
Do you want me to come
along with you or not?

1321
01:24:45,112 --> 01:24:46,471
Okay ...
Cool...

1322
01:24:46,495 --> 01:24:49,065
- I have a small work. We'll finish that and we'll go
- All right.

1323
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,947
- Divya, just five minutes.
- Okay

1324
01:24:55,102 --> 01:24:56,766
- Hey....Hi Cathy! How are you?
- Hi.

1325
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,642
I'm fine you.
And you? How have you been?

1326
01:24:58,768 --> 01:25:00,736
I am doing good
Enjoying eh?

1327
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,134
Guitar...singing...drawing

1328
01:25:02,494 --> 01:25:05,134
Just sitting and chilling out!

1329
01:25:05,509 --> 01:25:06,969
You've kept us waiting

1330
01:25:06,993 --> 01:25:09,360
Hey...Sorry for that
So tomorrow morning sharp at 8

1331
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:14,016
Don't keep us waiting too long
We'll be ready by 8

1332
01:25:23,214 --> 01:25:23,835
Vicky.

1333
01:25:24,023 --> 01:25:26,460
I am going to Delhi
to meet my grandpa

1334
01:25:27,054 --> 01:25:28,968
I'll be back in 10 days

1335
01:25:29,678 --> 01:25:30,640
Shall I go and come?

1336
01:25:31,763 --> 01:25:32,770
What is this?

1337
01:25:33,645 --> 01:25:35,481
Why are you asking me for
meeting youe grandpa?

1338
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:38,003
Divya

1339
01:25:39,617 --> 01:25:41,702
I think you've mistaken me

1340
01:25:43,195 --> 01:25:47,101
It was for our good that I said that
you must not act in that movie

1341
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:50,482
That doesn't mean that you have
to ask permission for everything

1342
01:25:51,505 --> 01:25:52,318
Understood?

1343
01:25:54,236 --> 01:25:54,958
Ok Vicky

1344
01:25:55,388 --> 01:25:56,231
I'll see you

1345
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,692
Okay.

1346
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:59,145
- Bye.
- Bye.

1347
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:00,902
Divya

1348
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:03,261
Tell me Vicky

1349
01:26:04,331 --> 01:26:05,292
I love you

1350
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:07,026
Bye.

1351
01:26:16,232 --> 01:26:18,224
Don't worry Divya

1352
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,114
He'll understand you

1353
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:23,570
I've never hidden anything from Vicky
1361
01: 26: 24.971 -> 01:26:27,588
Everything will be alright when
we are back from shooting

1354
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:29,479
Divya

1355
01:26:30,464 --> 01:26:31,401
Thanks a lot

1356
01:26:36,963 --> 01:26:38,087
Come, let's go

1357
01:26:38,548 --> 01:26:39,368
I am not coming

1358
01:26:39,657 --> 01:26:40,391
Hey

1359
01:26:40,627 --> 01:26:42,291
Go now
Isn't she calling you?

1360
01:26:42,315 --> 01:26:44,205
You will be the only guy who
doesn't go when a girl calls

1361
01:26:45,377 --> 01:26:46,494
You will ask me to go

1362
01:26:46,752 --> 01:26:48,994
She'll join me in some classes
like the English coaching!

1363
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:51,407
Then I have to take the knockings!
I'm not going.

1364
01:26:51,968 --> 01:26:53,617
I'll not hit you anymore

1365
01:26:53,891 --> 01:26:55,727
You don't need to go to
English classes anymore

1366
01:26:55,995 --> 01:26:58,393
I won't ask you to do
things that you don't like

1367
01:26:58,417 --> 01:26:59,424
Come.
Let's go

1368
01:26:59,862 --> 01:27:01,205
- Brother.
- Go now

1369
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,028
Where are we going?

1370
01:27:03,482 --> 01:27:05,403
- Brother, I'll stay here
- Go with her

1371
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:07,674
What should I do now?

1372
01:27:07,762 --> 01:27:09,897
Nothing Vicky
They are all artists

1373
01:27:10,315 --> 01:27:13,057
They want to go around the villages

1374
01:27:13,635 --> 01:27:16,375
Can you take them to your
village and bring them back?

1375
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:18,564
Yes boss, everything has been arranged

1376
01:27:18,837 --> 01:27:20,665
You just have to go with them

1377
01:27:20,806 --> 01:27:23,385
If I had not met with this accident
I would've gone myself

1378
01:27:25,661 --> 01:27:26,567
Ok, I'll go

1379
01:27:26,898 --> 01:27:28,819
Didn't I tell you
that Vicky will help us

1380
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,444
Thanks boss
Just a moment please

1381
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:33,900
Thanks for heping him Vicky

1382
01:27:34,478 --> 01:27:35,821
I didn't help him

1383
01:27:35,953 --> 01:27:37,196
I am helping you
1392
01: 27: 37.679 -> 01: 27: 39.030
You be careful with him

1384
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,882
Don't go with him on his bike

1385
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,053
I couldn't make it because of this accident

1386
01:27:44,077 --> 01:27:45,709
You take care

1387
01:27:45,912 --> 01:27:47,615
Have a good trip

1388
01:27:53,786 --> 01:27:54,871
As you said...

1389
01:27:54,949 --> 01:27:57,019
If he learns English in  a week...

1390
01:27:57,058 --> 01:27:58,042
I'll tonsure my head!

1391
01:27:58,196 --> 01:28:01,050
Didn't you learn English
by getting along with foreigners?

1392
01:28:01,812 --> 01:28:03,835
He will surely learn English

1393
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,589
Be ready to tonsure your head!

1394
01:28:07,761 --> 01:28:08,378
Hey.

1395
01:28:09,003 --> 01:28:09,792
What's the name?

1396
01:28:10,276 --> 01:28:11,018
Huh?

1397
01:28:11,362 --> 01:28:12,573
Your name,  name.

1398
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:15,479
Name ...Vicky

1399
01:28:15,503 --> 01:28:16,213
Vicky.

1400
01:28:16,752 --> 01:28:18,587
Vicky ...
Okay ... Hi Vicky.

1401
01:28:20,767 --> 01:28:23,048
Is that girl your girlfriend?

1402
01:28:23,621 --> 01:28:25,425
Not my friend
She is my lover

1403
01:28:28,342 --> 01:28:29,529
What is she doing?

1404
01:28:30,045 --> 01:28:31,240
I don't understand what you are saying

1405
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
"She is a tiny insect
crawls through my heart"

1406
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
"Wanting me to feel the lip-smacking
flavours of candy bars!"

1407
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,500
"Pulling out the words of
love and romance"

1408
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,700
"She kills me with
the charm of smile"

1409
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:57,700
"I go as unstable
as a pendulum does"

1410
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
"And it keeps me blabbering all
time uncertain, unclear!"

1411
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:08,700
"Struggling to get out of it as
if I'm tied up to something"

1412
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,700
"I play tunes to what
my darling says"

1413
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:18,000
"She is a tiny insect
crawls through my heart"

1414
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,700
"Wanting me to feel the lip-smacking
flavours of candy bars!"

1415
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,700
"Pulling out the words of
love and romance"

1416
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
"She kills me with
the charm of smile"

1417
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:45,034
Why are you so dull?

1418
01:29:45,867 --> 01:29:47,773
She has started acting without telling you

1419
01:29:48,372 --> 01:29:49,629
She asked you

1420
01:29:49,715 --> 01:29:52,144
But you didn't allow
So she left!

1421
01:29:52,917 --> 01:29:54,237
She  has got talent!

1422
01:29:56,089 --> 01:29:58,518
She has a good future
Wait and see

1423
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,700
"The bull had itself refrained
for her sizzling words,"

1424
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
"Signing yes for everything she says!"

1425
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,500
"Wandering all around the town,"

1426
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:18,000
"It got itself halted to
eat the bunch of grass!"

1427
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:40,500
"Pulling out the words of love and romance,
She kills me with the charm of smile"

1428
01:30:42,091 --> 01:30:43,982
God, save me!

1429
01:30:44,107 --> 01:30:45,435
Be ready to tonsure!

1430
01:30:47,518 --> 01:30:48,942
The vehicle has arrived

1431
01:30:57,737 --> 01:30:59,666
Hi Vicky.
How was your trip?

1432
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:00,658
Nice

1433
01:31:01,158 --> 01:31:01,947
Very nice

1434
01:31:03,845 --> 01:31:05,321
Thank you so much Vicky.

1435
01:31:05,346 --> 01:31:06,329
One minute.

1436
01:31:06,523 --> 01:31:07,477
Thanks!

1437
01:31:08,179 --> 01:31:08,929
Hey Cathy!

1438
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:10,882
- This is my lover Divya
- Oh

1439
01:31:11,031 --> 01:31:11,923
Hi Divya

1440
01:31:12,378 --> 01:31:13,633
You're very beautiful.

1441
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:14,760
Thanks

1442
01:31:15,448 --> 01:31:16,612
That was a nice trip!

1443
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,299
I've had enough of
teaching Tamil to you all

1444
01:31:20,564 --> 01:31:22,517
- Go and take rest
- See you Vicky!

1445
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:23,696
- Bye.
- See you later.

1446
01:31:23,962 --> 01:31:24,798
Bye.

1447
01:31:25,072 --> 01:31:26,118
Good girls.

1448
01:31:28,106 --> 01:31:29,668
Why is he laughing like a mad man?

1449
01:31:32,152 --> 01:31:33,098
You ask him!

1450
01:31:33,707 --> 01:31:34,683
Divya

1451
01:31:36,654 --> 01:31:37,693
Are you angry?

1452
01:31:38,232 --> 01:31:39,482
Did he do something?

1453
01:31:40,008 --> 01:31:42,118
Only if you tell me
I'll know, isn't it?

1454
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:43,094
Divya

1455
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:45,023
What happened?

1456
01:31:46,804 --> 01:31:47,679
Vicky...

1457
01:31:49,866 --> 01:31:51,936
Sign a movie soon Vicky...

1458
01:31:54,303 --> 01:31:56,053
Whitout any work

1459
01:31:56,881 --> 01:31:57,896
I am not active

1460
01:32:01,102 --> 01:32:02,367
I don't know about you

1461
01:32:03,463 --> 01:32:06,486
I've been in cinema for 30 years

1462
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:09,226
And I didn't learn anything...

1463
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:16,212
Vicky.

1464
01:32:18,532 --> 01:32:20,719
Last week my daughter gave birth...

1465
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:22,804
She didn't tell me

1466
01:32:24,278 --> 01:32:27,965
Maybe it's because
I would go and meet...

1467
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:31,502
Leave it Vicky
You are with me, that's enough

1468
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:34,072
We'll do 2 or 3 films in this year

1469
01:32:34,322 --> 01:32:36,017
and we'll build a multiplex theatre in dad's name

1470
01:32:43,898 --> 01:32:45,021
Call and talk to them Vicky

1471
01:32:48,874 --> 01:32:50,022
Hello, who is it?

1472
01:32:50,046 --> 01:32:52,022
I shot your hand. Don't you know
I can shoot your head?

1473
01:32:52,047 --> 01:32:53,372
Give the money I asked for

1474
01:32:53,397 --> 01:32:55,678
Hey, who are you?
Why should I give you money?

1475
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:58,810
- Hang up
- This is your last chance

1476
01:32:58,835 --> 01:33:00,303
Do what you can!

1477
01:33:00,327 --> 01:33:02,717
What can you do idiot?

1478
01:33:24,385 --> 01:33:25,353
Ok, I'm leaving

1479
01:33:30,669 --> 01:33:32,669
Vicky

1480
01:33:33,562 --> 01:33:35,421
If you want to go out
don't go alone

1481
01:33:35,687 --> 01:33:37,343
Call me too
I will come along

1482
01:33:43,033 --> 01:33:46,283
I've got the foreign liquor
that the forein girls got me!

1483
01:34:16,369 --> 01:34:17,189
Brother.

1484
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:22,009
Brother.

1485
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,168
Brother,get up.

1486
01:34:30,652 --> 01:34:31,777
We have to change the reel

1487
01:34:32,652 --> 01:34:34,066
Get up, brother!

1488
01:34:55,384 --> 01:34:56,969
I've changed the reel brother!

1489
01:35:08,805 --> 01:35:09,484
Brother.

1490
01:35:12,444 --> 01:35:13,311
Brother, get up

1491
01:35:14,561 --> 01:35:15,467
Brother.

1492
01:36:01,114 --> 01:36:02,301
I've arrived at the place I've been told

1493
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:05,184
Hello.

1494
01:36:30,509 --> 01:36:31,829
Is the cash ready?

1495
01:36:32,867 --> 01:36:35,234
- Where is Durai?
- Do you have the cash?

1496
01:36:35,472 --> 01:36:37,667
It's all there
Where is Durai?

1497
01:36:38,393 --> 01:36:39,378
Look there.

1498
01:36:42,953 --> 01:36:44,226
First give me the cash

1499
01:36:44,664 --> 01:36:45,859
I'll give it there

1500
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:49,374
Shit

1501
01:37:33,413 --> 01:37:34,835
Toy've finally reached native!

1502
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,007
Mom.

1503
01:37:37,874 --> 01:37:40,499
Looks like I've slept nicely

1504
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:42,560
Just 5 minutes
We'll meet and go

1505
01:37:45,703 --> 01:37:46,664
What happened Vicky?

1506
01:37:48,914 --> 01:37:49,843
Sorry, brother.

1507
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:55,029
- What if something had happened to you?
- Hey.

1508
01:37:55,408 --> 01:37:58,009
Nothing happened, isn't it?
When you're with me nothing will happen

1509
01:37:58,447 --> 01:37:59,189
Come, let's go

1510
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,562
No brother.

1511
01:38:00,828 --> 01:38:01,601
That's enough

1512
01:38:02,015 --> 01:38:03,468
You stay in your house hereafter

1513
01:38:04,475 --> 01:38:05,975
Don't blabber like a mad man!

1514
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:08,506
Come, let's meet them and go

1515
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:09,678
It's enough brother

1516
01:38:11,028 --> 01:38:12,715
Enough of working hard for me!

1517
01:38:14,441 --> 01:38:16,331
After my parents passed away
you have been living for me

1518
01:38:17,617 --> 01:38:19,054
You've forgotten your family

1519
01:38:20,203 --> 01:38:21,492
You be with them hereafter

1520
01:38:21,882 --> 01:38:22,889
Live for yourself

1521
01:38:22,967 --> 01:38:23,990
Don't talk like an idiot

1522
01:38:24,412 --> 01:38:26,044
Let's go to Chennai
Come on

1523
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,851
We'll  go to Chennai
and sign a movie

1524
01:38:27,876 --> 01:38:30,219
If we don't go for shooting only then
we tend to think all these things

1525
01:38:31,883 --> 01:38:32,570
Vicky.

1526
01:38:33,163 --> 01:38:34,405
Don't leave me and go

1527
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:38,338
 I'll not talk of cinema anymore

1528
01:38:38,831 --> 01:38:39,768
Vicky.

1529
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:40,924
Don't leave me

1530
01:38:42,088 --> 01:38:43,635
At least come to my house and go

1531
01:38:44,635 --> 01:38:45,353
Hey.

1532
01:38:46,033 --> 01:38:46,751
Vicky.

1533
01:38:50,956 --> 01:38:52,393
Why do you want this trouble?

1534
01:38:52,418 --> 01:38:54,104
He has a lot of political power

1535
01:38:54,222 --> 01:38:55,644
You can't do anything against him.

1536
01:38:55,925 --> 01:38:57,815
That guy who died has left
the theatre in your name

1537
01:38:58,542 --> 01:39:00,120
Can you run this theater?

1538
01:39:01,885 --> 01:39:02,698
Look at me

1539
01:39:03,378 --> 01:39:04,667
I'll negotiate and get you some money

1540
01:39:04,877 --> 01:39:07,893
Give the theatre to them and go
to your village to make a living

1541
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:11,515
Why do you want to strugle
like him with this theatre?

1542
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:15,515
I've said what I have too

1543
01:39:16,578 --> 01:39:17,429
Understood?

1544
01:39:19,218 --> 01:39:21,179
It's your wish now
Let's go!

1545
01:39:41,635 --> 01:39:42,697
Nobody is in the house?

1546
01:39:44,054 --> 01:39:45,213
I've sent them all away

1547
01:39:46,821 --> 01:39:47,829
I'm sorry, Vicky.

1548
01:39:51,227 --> 01:39:53,703
It's my mistake to go
and act without telling you

1549
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:59,607
You like it and so you went

1550
01:40:01,241 --> 01:40:02,990
Don't you like me acting?

1551
01:40:06,379 --> 01:40:07,926
Why are we talking all this Divya?

1552
01:40:09,058 --> 01:40:10,362
I need to know Vicky.

1553
01:40:11,925 --> 01:40:13,401
Isn't that why you are leaving me?

1554
01:40:16,398 --> 01:40:17,518
No Divya

1555
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:20,687
Tell me Vicky!

1556
01:40:21,976 --> 01:40:23,679
Don't you like me acting?

1557
01:40:25,281 --> 01:40:26,898
What wrong did I do?

1558
01:40:27,281 --> 01:40:28,484
I don't understand.

1559
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:32,395
If we have to tell reasons to
understand and live...then...

1560
01:40:34,437 --> 01:40:35,942
...that life is not necessary.

1561
01:40:37,012 --> 01:40:39,622
Are you going to leave me
because of this small thing?

1562
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:43,648
I am leaving you?

1563
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:46,916
Where did I leave you?

1564
01:40:49,982 --> 01:40:52,013
What did I do for you
to lie to me and go?

1565
01:40:53,111 --> 01:40:54,318
Is this called love?

1566
01:40:56,278 --> 01:40:58,423
When you want to do whatever you
want then why do you want me?

1567
01:40:59,749 --> 01:41:00,637
You don't need all this

1568
01:41:03,067 --> 01:41:03,936
It's enough, Divya

1569
01:41:09,684 --> 01:41:13,542
That's why I asked why
we are talking all this now!

1570
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:18,911
You are important for me, Vicky!

1571
01:41:21,145 --> 01:41:22,566
You already told a similar lie...

1572
01:41:25,904 --> 01:41:27,083
Do not lie to me again now.

1573
01:41:29,748 --> 01:41:30,943
Please leave now

1574
01:41:41,969 --> 01:41:43,116
What are you doing Vicky?

1575
01:41:44,215 --> 01:41:45,597
The morning show is at 11

1576
01:41:46,105 --> 01:41:47,089
The show must go on

1577
01:41:47,662 --> 01:41:48,730
I'm getting ready for that

1578
01:41:49,573 --> 01:41:51,174
Didn't you understand what
the inspector said?

1579
01:41:51,315 --> 01:41:52,869
They are horrible people

1580
01:41:53,252 --> 01:41:54,744
Do not talk like a fool, Vicky.

1581
01:41:55,286 --> 01:41:56,068
Yes.

1582
01:41:56,404 --> 01:41:57,927
I 'm a fool.

1583
01:41:58,671 --> 01:42:00,538
I left brother listening to you!

1584
01:42:01,475 --> 01:42:02,514
I'm a fool.

1585
01:42:03,148 --> 01:42:03,945
Then...

1586
01:42:04,641 --> 01:42:07,445
Do you mean to say that
I am the reason for Durai uncle's death?

1587
01:42:10,101 --> 01:42:10,867
No.

1588
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:12,624
I am responsible

1589
01:42:14,028 --> 01:42:16,231
I will not be responsible
for this theatre to crumble

1590
01:42:17,593 --> 01:42:18,296
Vicky.

1591
01:42:18,523 --> 01:42:19,773
Understand what I'm trying to say

1592
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:22,619
Even if you save this theatre from them

1593
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:24,525
You can't run this all by yourself

1594
01:42:24,908 --> 01:42:26,806
Look at how you've become

1595
01:42:27,306 --> 01:42:28,891
Who will watch a movie here?

1596
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:31,711
We'll sell this theatre

1597
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:33,961
and start a new living

1598
01:42:34,359 --> 01:42:36,179
Durai uncle also will be
wishing for the same

1599
01:42:36,421 --> 01:42:38,002
What do you know of him?

1600
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:42,286
This theatre is brother's life!

1601
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:45,512
He will be with me as
long as this theatre is!

1602
01:42:47,044 --> 01:42:48,465
Instead of starting a 
living selling this...

1603
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:51,090
I'll live by running this

1604
01:42:52,654 --> 01:42:53,669
This is my life.

1605
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:55,536
Be with me if you like

1606
01:42:57,161 --> 01:42:59,028
- Or else...?
- Or else get lost from here!

1607
01:43:01,939 --> 01:43:03,235
You do not want me, isn't it?

1608
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:06,203
Marry someone who speaks good English

1609
01:43:06,594 --> 01:43:08,047
and earns good money

1610
01:43:09,179 --> 01:43:10,242
You want that!

1611
01:43:11,023 --> 01:43:11,733
Go!

1612
01:43:27,423 --> 01:43:28,196
Sir.

1613
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,786
The girl herself has given a statement
that she had come to kill him...

1614
01:43:30,982 --> 01:43:32,160
Then why are we having
this unwanted discussion?

1615
01:43:33,512 --> 01:43:34,028
Sir.

1616
01:43:34,504 --> 01:43:35,652
What they are doing is illegal

1617
01:43:36,316 --> 01:43:37,355
Just give me one chance.

1618
01:43:38,047 --> 01:43:41,041
We'll get the facts of this case
only if we raid the factory

1619
01:43:41,478 --> 01:43:42,868
Then we can close the case easily

1620
01:43:43,462 --> 01:43:44,962
How do you say that Ranjith?

1621
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:46,475
If we need to know about Lucia...

1622
01:43:46,819 --> 01:43:48,240
Then we have to arrest Vajravelu

1623
01:43:48,506 --> 01:43:49,224
Sir.

1624
01:43:49,427 --> 01:43:51,528
Only he is talking of
Lucia and Vajravelu

1625
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:53,911
Is the statement given
by that girl a lie?

1626
01:43:54,184 --> 01:43:55,184
She has confessed!

1627
01:43:55,418 --> 01:43:55,997
Sir.

1628
01:43:57,039 --> 01:43:58,062
I want to talk to that girl

1629
01:44:12,374 --> 01:44:13,851
Is this the statement that you gave?

1630
01:44:22,087 --> 01:44:22,977
I don't believe

1631
01:44:23,804 --> 01:44:24,579
Tell me

1632
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,923
Why you have given a wrong statement?

1633
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,565
Tell me!

1634
01:44:33,756 --> 01:44:34,632
That's not a lie.

1635
01:44:37,902 --> 01:44:38,605
Okay.

1636
01:44:38,748 --> 01:44:39,669
That's not a lie

1637
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:41,754
Then why did you come to kill him?

1638
01:44:43,606 --> 01:44:45,098
Do you really love him?

1639
01:44:47,111 --> 01:44:47,947
Or...

1640
01:44:48,104 --> 01:44:49,494
...are you acting as
though you love him?

1641
01:44:51,955 --> 01:44:52,626
Tell me

1642
01:44:52,962 --> 01:44:54,008
What happened?

1643
01:44:55,526 --> 01:44:56,258
Tell me

1644
01:44:58,354 --> 01:44:59,150
I don't know

1645
01:45:01,159 --> 01:45:02,368
I don't know!

1646
01:45:03,437 --> 01:45:06,780
I don't know what happened in our lives.

1647
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:12,837
I can't see him in a vegetative sate!

1648
01:45:14,184 --> 01:45:18,829
I can't bear the pain that
he suffers everyday, so I did it!

1649
01:45:19,296 --> 01:45:19,925
Why?

1650
01:45:21,862 --> 01:45:22,768
Because I love him

1651
01:45:25,034 --> 01:45:26,112
I love him

1652
01:45:43,586 --> 01:45:44,687
Do you believe now?

1653
01:45:47,555 --> 01:45:50,093
Now I need you permission
to raid the company

1654
01:45:52,507 --> 01:45:54,100
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

1655
01:45:56,628 --> 01:45:58,987
Cathy! I don't know what to tell

1656
01:46:02,171 --> 01:46:07,092
I have to somehow ensure that
this theatre is prosperous

1657
01:46:07,452 --> 01:46:10,444
Hey,it's ok, don't cry
We'll find a solution

1658
01:46:13,388 --> 01:46:14,138
Hey, Jill

1659
01:46:14,607 --> 01:46:15,279
Yeah it's me

1660
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:17,966
I need you to come and help me

1661
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:29,500
"Is that my own heart?"

1662
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
"Is my tear that you want?"

1663
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:45,000
"Is tears enough for flowers to grow?"

1664
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
"Don't you need water to grow?"

1665
01:47:06,257 --> 01:47:07,546
Our theatre...

1666
01:47:10,027 --> 01:47:10,941
Your theatre brother

1667
01:47:12,796 --> 01:47:13,874
It's all set now brother!

1668
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:16,927
Take a look brother!
It's ready brother!

1669
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:30,000
"Here and there,
leaves everywhere!"

1670
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:37,000
"When the water is all dry"

1671
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,500
"The poor seeks it from the sky!"

1672
01:47:40,544 --> 01:47:42,083
Thank you.

1673
01:47:42,933 --> 01:47:44,401
I never forget this help

1674
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,500
"When you open up the soul,"

1675
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,500
"Put down the lyrics
od love out of Kajal!"

1676
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:08,000
"Is that my own heart?"

1677
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:15,000
"Is my tear that you want?"

1678
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:24,000
"Is tears enough for flowers to grow?"

1679
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,000
"Don't you need water to grow?"

1680
01:49:06,886 --> 01:49:09,815
This theatre which was not bothered
by anyone has become modern now...

1681
01:49:09,839 --> 01:49:11,229
Four foreigners are the reason for this

1682
01:49:11,588 --> 01:49:13,214
Come...let's hear
what they have to say

1683
01:49:13,988 --> 01:49:15,355
You've done a fabulous work

1684
01:49:15,535 --> 01:49:16,675
Thank you so much

1685
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:18,042
What made you to do this?

1686
01:49:18,488 --> 01:49:20,433
Actually we did this for our friend Vicky

1687
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:23,346
Is he here?

1688
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:24,627
He's not here right now
He went to a special place

1689
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:27,906
There is customer for your table

1690
01:49:32,844 --> 01:49:33,851
Hi Divya

1691
01:49:34,913 --> 01:49:35,608
Hi.

1692
01:49:38,937 --> 01:49:41,647
Thanks for coming to meet me

1693
01:49:48,699 --> 01:49:49,747
Isn't that place nice?

1694
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,598
Can we go and talk there?

1695
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:53,777
Hmm

1696
01:50:01,054 --> 01:50:03,225
I never thought that
you would call me

1697
01:50:05,418 --> 01:50:08,870
It was my mistake to
have lied to you about my acting

1698
01:50:09,744 --> 01:50:10,534
Leave it Divya

1699
01:50:11,182 --> 01:50:12,198
I've forgotton that

1700
01:50:12,812 --> 01:50:13,494
But...

1701
01:50:14,385 --> 01:50:16,429
I am not able to forget anything

1702
01:50:17,289 --> 01:50:18,249
I miss you...

1703
01:50:20,225 --> 01:50:21,459
...and I still love you...

1704
01:50:43,709 --> 01:50:45,326
1 hot pepper passion pizza

1705
01:50:46,216 --> 01:50:49,607
Red pepper...Green pepper
Jalapenos....Cheese

1706
01:50:57,165 --> 01:50:58,006
One more

1707
01:50:59,661 --> 01:51:01,996
Will you marry me?

1708
01:51:02,192 --> 01:51:02,959
What?

1709
01:51:12,559 --> 01:51:13,560
I said it right

1710
01:51:14,076 --> 01:51:15,622
Will you marry me?

1711
01:51:16,823 --> 01:51:18,138
I don't know English.

1712
01:51:20,066 --> 01:51:22,481
You know how much I struggles
to memorise these in English?

1713
01:51:23,339 --> 01:51:24,956
You don't have to talk in English

1714
01:51:25,159 --> 01:51:26,416
Tamil is more than enough

1715
01:51:26,729 --> 01:51:27,838
I like that

1716
01:51:28,427 --> 01:51:29,251
Tamil?

1717
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:37,735
Will you marry me,

1718
01:51:38,298 --> 01:51:40,337
and become my wife?

1719
01:51:55,079 --> 01:51:56,064
I can't believe

1720
01:51:57,752 --> 01:51:59,751
I don't understand whether
all this real or dream

1721
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:04,032
If it's a dream, then it
has been a bad dream!

1722
01:52:04,391 --> 01:52:07,672
If it was a good dream, then
will we bw talking like this?

1723
01:52:11,287 --> 01:52:12,880
Let today be the last day of that
bad dream

1724
01:52:13,569 --> 01:52:14,537
That's why I called you

1725
01:52:15,165 --> 01:52:16,140
I don't understand Vicky!

1726
01:52:18,633 --> 01:52:20,836
How happy we were in reality!

1727
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:24,384
Tjis dream is all my fault

1728
01:52:26,025 --> 01:52:27,079
I don't know Vicky

1729
01:52:28,689 --> 01:52:30,314
I am not able to bear it!

1730
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,603
I love you Divya!

1731
01:52:45,169 --> 01:52:47,036
Let's not part anymore Vicky!

1732
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:48,780
Forgive me Divya!

1733
01:52:50,303 --> 01:52:52,592
I've hurt you very much in this
game of dream and reality

1734
01:52:54,291 --> 01:52:55,861
I've also hurt you!

1735
01:53:03,426 --> 01:53:04,277
Close your eyes.

1736
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:08,101
I'll tell you
Close your eyes.

1737
01:53:11,834 --> 01:53:13,427
What are you thinking now?

1738
01:53:16,929 --> 01:53:18,272
A lonely beach...

1739
01:53:20,247 --> 01:53:21,754
Evening time...

1740
01:53:23,025 --> 01:53:25,071
With only me qnd you...

1741
01:53:26,959 --> 01:53:27,810
Then...

1742
01:53:28,864 --> 01:53:30,598
I lie down on your shoulder

1743
01:54:11,215 --> 01:54:12,950
No No...Customer's
dreams are our dreams

1744
01:54:21,767 --> 01:54:22,900
How do you know him?

1745
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,321
I do not know anything about him, sir.

1746
01:54:26,953 --> 01:54:28,500
It's Murugan and Sudaram who bring him

1747
01:54:29,335 --> 01:54:30,265
Lucia.

1748
01:54:30,599 --> 01:54:33,628
It's not only gives you a good
sleep but also a beautiful dream

1749
01:54:34,184 --> 01:54:36,457
A dream that you always wanted

1750
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:38,027
It's for you.

1751
01:54:41,008 --> 01:54:42,203
Why did yhe come to meet you?

1752
01:54:42,585 --> 01:54:43,835
He lacks sleep!

1753
01:54:44,412 --> 01:54:45,662
He is insomniac!

1754
01:54:46,651 --> 01:54:49,252
We met him to get sleeping pills

1755
01:54:49,345 --> 01:54:50,611
Take that

1756
01:54:55,821 --> 01:54:57,024
Sir, new ones!

1757
01:54:58,344 --> 01:54:59,469
How will he get the dream?

1758
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,538
He writes a story in his diary

1759
01:55:01,851 --> 01:55:03,155
That is his dream.

1760
01:55:04,628 --> 01:55:05,752
Is this your dream?

1761
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,062
This is the story which both
of us wrote together, that's all

1762
01:55:32,181 --> 01:55:34,189
Sir, just a minute
Look at TV

1763
01:55:36,906 --> 01:55:39,959
We had kept this interview
under wraps for so long

1764
01:55:41,021 --> 01:55:43,960
This is the right time
to telecast that

1765
01:55:44,536 --> 01:55:48,622
You will know why when you watch this

1766
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:54,697
He should get what he desired

1767
01:55:56,109 --> 01:55:57,257
That is our desire

1768
01:55:58,156 --> 01:55:59,726
My desire too
Thanks!

1769
01:56:00,358 --> 01:56:01,351
Welcome Vignesh

1770
01:56:02,111 --> 01:56:05,829
We thank you on behalf of
our television for this interview...

1771
01:56:06,095 --> 01:56:08,368
...depsite your hectic schedule

1772
01:56:08,915 --> 01:56:09,829
My pleasure

1773
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:11,039
Of course.

1774
01:56:11,195 --> 01:56:13,218
We have a lot to ask you!

1775
01:56:13,905 --> 01:56:14,882
First question.

1776
01:56:15,695 --> 01:56:17,390
Why do you wear glasses?

1777
01:56:17,538 --> 01:56:18,726
I had an accident when I was a kid

1778
01:56:20,117 --> 01:56:21,593
If I'm not wrong...

1779
01:56:21,687 --> 01:56:24,210
...it was the same aacident
which you lost your parents in, is it?

1780
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:29,838
It's not only my parents that I lost,
but also the colors of my life!

1781
01:56:30,556 --> 01:56:32,252
I mean I'm color blind

1782
01:56:32,843 --> 01:56:35,843
Basiclly , I can't see any colors

1783
01:56:36,458 --> 01:56:37,675
Everything is black and white

1784
01:56:39,116 --> 01:56:40,515
Too much of light is also harmful

1785
01:56:41,068 --> 01:56:43,076
I always wear these glasses

1786
01:56:46,677 --> 01:56:48,482
Okay.
I'm sorry.

1787
01:56:49,663 --> 01:56:51,092
Does anyone know this fact?

1788
01:56:51,873 --> 01:56:52,677
No

1789
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:54,705
I've never felt like
telling anyone

1790
01:56:55,181 --> 01:56:56,259
I said it just because you asked me

1791
01:56:56,469 --> 01:56:57,594
Brother Durai knows it

1792
01:56:57,914 --> 01:56:59,507
No one else

1793
01:57:00,687 --> 01:57:02,476
You are a great movie star

1794
01:57:03,812 --> 01:57:05,476
How do you feel about it?

1795
01:57:07,795 --> 01:57:08,624
It's nice

1796
01:57:09,765 --> 01:57:11,013
My father is a big star

1797
01:57:11,654 --> 01:57:13,107
My stardom is a result of that

1798
01:57:13,963 --> 01:57:16,650
Your dad maybe is a big star, but...

1799
01:57:16,907 --> 01:57:17,977
However,

1800
01:57:18,219 --> 01:57:20,750
Isn't your hard work a reason for this?

1801
01:57:21,849 --> 01:57:23,599
Sure...I've worked hard

1802
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:27,204
But all those who work hard
don't end up being a star

1803
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:29,938
I'm very lucky.

1804
01:57:30,415 --> 01:57:32,657
I think you are being very modest

1805
01:57:33,461 --> 01:57:34,179
Okay.

1806
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:38,181
There are many facts
like these which no one knows...

1807
01:57:38,361 --> 01:57:40,892
I'm sure you would've shared
all this with someone

1808
01:57:41,196 --> 01:57:46,180
For example, close friend or best
friends or people like that

1809
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:51,152
I don't have any best
or close friends...

1810
01:57:52,671 --> 01:57:54,585
Since my childhood...

1811
01:57:55,273 --> 01:57:56,577
I've only seen this world of cinema

1812
01:57:57,539 --> 01:57:59,171
I don't even know how
the outside world is!

1813
01:58:01,305 --> 01:58:03,992
So everyone sees me as a star

1814
01:58:05,398 --> 01:58:07,828
I don't know who really cares for me

1815
01:58:08,336 --> 01:58:10,789
Or who uses me

1816
01:58:12,888 --> 01:58:15,747
So I am alone always
I don't let anyone near me

1817
01:58:16,209 --> 01:58:17,231
That's interesting.

1818
01:58:18,579 --> 01:58:21,544
Everyone has a dream from their childhood

1819
01:58:21,779 --> 01:58:26,668
I have always dreamt
of being a cinema star

1820
01:58:27,215 --> 01:58:30,324
What dream does Vignesh have?

1821
01:58:34,856 --> 01:58:36,676
I dream of living the life
of an ordinary person

1822
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:38,660
Really?

1823
01:58:39,547 --> 01:58:40,812
Ordinary means?

1824
01:58:41,745 --> 01:58:46,792
A simple ordinary life
without all this stardom

1825
01:58:49,565 --> 01:58:51,236
I want to eat at
the roadside outlets

1826
01:58:53,367 --> 01:58:54,468
I want to roam the city on  a bicycle

1827
01:58:54,862 --> 01:58:58,626
I want to live like an ordinary person
like any other

1828
01:59:00,283 --> 01:59:01,384
That;s my dream

1829
01:59:01,877 --> 01:59:02,868
That's my wish

1830
01:59:03,369 --> 01:59:07,860
Whatever you get in cinema you will not
get in an ordinary life, is that fine?

1831
01:59:09,061 --> 01:59:09,858
That's fine!

1832
01:59:10,028 --> 01:59:12,583
Who is Vignesh in that dream?

1833
01:59:15,898 --> 01:59:17,882
In my dream...I...

1834
01:59:18,952 --> 01:59:21,092
I see myself as a
torchbearer in a theatre

1835
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:23,270
What?

1836
01:59:23,591 --> 01:59:26,498
Have you ever seen
a torchbearer in a theatre?

1837
01:59:27,528 --> 01:59:28,879
Do remember their faces?

1838
01:59:29,945 --> 01:59:31,038
They see everyone...

1839
01:59:31,929 --> 01:59:33,288
But nobody sees them!

1840
01:59:35,006 --> 01:59:36,170
Invisible in a crowd!

1841
01:59:37,959 --> 01:59:38,638
That's...

1842
01:59:38,927 --> 01:59:40,137
That's really true

1843
01:59:41,127 --> 01:59:43,556
Anything else from that dream?

1844
01:59:45,298 --> 01:59:46,244
A love...

1845
01:59:47,158 --> 01:59:48,087
Thanks

1846
01:59:48,437 --> 01:59:49,819
Struggle for that love...

1847
01:59:52,486 --> 01:59:54,345
I've never been through
that struggle in reality

1848
01:59:56,286 --> 01:59:57,520
I like that struggle very much...

1849
01:59:58,375 --> 02:00:01,570
Do you have a love in reality
that is similar to your dream?

1850
02:00:15,122 --> 02:00:17,293
Isn't heart enough to fall in love?

1851
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:23,109
Yes, I love that firl!
She too loves me! Is that enough?

1852
02:00:25,873 --> 02:00:27,880
If we have to live by
explaining the reasons...

1853
02:00:30,168 --> 02:00:31,543
Then I don't need such a life...

1854
02:00:36,545 --> 02:00:38,412
He has ended his real life

1855
02:00:38,513 --> 02:00:41,013
He's living the life he wanted in his dreams

1856
02:00:42,087 --> 02:00:43,993
It's a common mentality...

1857
02:00:44,966 --> 02:00:49,030
...to live life like someone else,
instead of living their own life

1858
02:00:49,608 --> 02:00:52,866
The poor wants to live
the life of a rich!

1859
02:00:53,231 --> 02:00:57,184
The rich want to live the life
of an ordinary simple man

1860
02:00:57,817 --> 02:01:00,465
It's human tendency to desire
for what is nor available

1861
02:01:01,049 --> 02:01:02,510
He must have also
thought the same

1862
02:01:02,939 --> 02:01:04,611
He was psychologically
prepared for it!

1863
02:01:05,587 --> 02:01:09,273
- Yes, sir.
-So if we want to bring him back from his dreams...

1864
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:13,741
I mean...to bring what is going on his head
subconscious mind to the conscious mind

1865
02:01:14,224 --> 02:01:15,973
We have to have 
a holistic approch

1866
02:01:18,917 --> 02:01:20,049
Why Vicky?
1876. 
02:01:25,128 --> 02:01:30,456
Have I not been close enough
to understand you without explanations?

1867
02:01:37,559 --> 02:01:41,346
Had you told me that you wanted to
leave cinema and live a normal life...

1868
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:44,322
I wouldn't have become
an actress Vicky!

1869
02:01:48,888 --> 02:01:50,084
Wake up Vicky!

1870
02:01:52,584 --> 02:01:54,451
Get up Vicky!
It's getting late

1871
02:01:54,662 --> 02:01:56,076
Aren't you going to the theatre?

1872
02:01:56,442 --> 02:01:59,160
We have a new movie releasing today
and you sleep like this!

1873
02:01:59,467 --> 02:02:00,451
Get up Vicky!

1874
02:02:00,849 --> 02:02:01,849
Get ready fast

1875
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:04,083
It's been 4 years since marriage
and he hasn't changed a bit

1876
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:06,434
Come for breakfast soon!

1877
02:02:09,895 --> 02:02:10,793
Vicky!

1878
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:14,424
Got up!

1879
02:02:14,963 --> 02:02:16,517
What were you dreaming today?

1880
02:02:16,783 --> 02:02:17,736
Hmmm

1881
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:21,892
I was lying on a bed in a hospital

1882
02:02:22,153 --> 02:02:24,153
Hospital?
Was I with you?

1883
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:25,911
How can it be without you!

1884
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:28,277
I don't know why

1885
02:02:28,777 --> 02:02:30,323
you were crying holding my hands!

1886
02:02:31,255 --> 02:02:32,253
Is it?

1887
02:02:32,354 --> 02:02:35,112
Ok...
Go feed her. It's getting late for school

1888
02:02:38,474 --> 02:02:39,309
Chinnu...Chinnu darling...

1889
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:41,710
Chinnu darling...
Dad came here.

1890
02:02:42,881 --> 02:02:43,693
Chinnu

1891
02:02:45,224 --> 02:02:46,583
Chinnu darling...

1892
02:02:47,137 --> 02:02:48,286
Look at me

1893
02:02:48,997 --> 02:02:51,145
See what dad has brought for you...

1894
02:02:51,635 --> 02:02:52,417
Chinnu

1895
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,554
You can live the life that you desire

1896
02:02:55,751 --> 02:02:56,837
Wake up Vicky!

1897
02:02:59,337 --> 02:03:00,751
Vicky, please.

1898
02:03:02,337 --> 02:03:03,321
Vicky.

1899
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:06,023
Doctor.

1900
02:03:06,476 --> 02:03:07,358
Vicky.

1901
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:10,302
Vicky.

1902
02:03:11,278 --> 02:03:12,160
Vicky.

1903
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:15,465
Keep talking something...

1904
02:03:16,954 --> 02:03:17,837
Divya

1905
02:03:19,423 --> 02:03:20,306
Divya

1906
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:21,633
Divya

1907
02:03:22,821 --> 02:03:23,704
Vicky.

1908
02:03:26,048 --> 02:03:26,931
Divya

1909
02:03:28,666 --> 02:03:30,041
- Divya
- Vicky.

1910
02:03:32,909 --> 02:03:34,151
- Chinnu
- Vicky.

1911
02:03:34,682 --> 02:03:35,292
Vicky.

1912
02:03:37,636 --> 02:03:38,940
- Divya
- Vicky.

1913
02:03:54,776 --> 02:03:55,988
Divya...
