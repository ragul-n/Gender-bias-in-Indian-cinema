1
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:24,325
"Om Jai Jagdish.."

2
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:33,966
"He removes the troubles
of devotees in moments.."

3
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:38,091
"Om Jai Jagdish.."

4
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:44,652
"Om Jai Jagdish.."

5
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:53,122
"He removes the troubles
of devotees in moments.."

6
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:57,138
"Om Jai Jagdish.."

7
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:04,423
I salute you Raja Sir!

8
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:07,794
Your kingdom is gone but the
customs are still in place.

9
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:10,109
Going by your grandiose
and the flamboyance..

10
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,430
..it appears as if times
haven't changed.

11
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:15,135
I shall not allow times
to change, Kedarnath.

12
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:17,935
I shall not allow the style,
splendor, and grandiosity..

13
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:20,863
..that has been here through
so many generations..

14
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,216
..to be shattered so easily.

15
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:27,057
Anyway. I have brought up
Manorama with great love.

16
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:32,056
She has absolutely forgotten
here parents who passed away.

17
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,519
Now we are her parents.

18
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,142
We have only one niece.

19
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:38,975
Just consider that we
are handing over..

20
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,724
..a piece of our heart
into your household.

21
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:44,048
The almanac of Rama and
Rupesh will match anyway.

22
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,015
Rama will complete her education
and return to India..

23
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:49,896
..and..

24
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,016
And shall we consider this
match to be final in a way?

25
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:57,015
Consider it final?
Consider that it has been sealed!

26
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,606
Greetings!

27
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:58,938
Greetings Lala. Come. Come!

28
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,183
Salutations to you, Raja Sir.

29
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:01,913
Please meet him. He is our..

30
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:03,536
Tail. My lord. Tail!

31
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:08,734
Unless he meets me he will not be
able to eat a morsel of food.

32
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:13,175
Prince, our child is very
simple, very innocent.

33
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,015
She is as mild as a cow. A cow.

34
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:19,078
She doesn't have a tongue in
her mouth. She is mute! Dumb!

35
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,256
Lala!

36
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:24,496
Sorry my Lord. My tongue
just slipped.

37
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:27,576
Raja sir, allow us to leave.

38
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:30,687
It is dusk and we have
a long way ahead.

39
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,166
All right Kedarnath.

40
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,319
See them off at the car.

41
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:34,311
Greetings.

42
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,696
Young King!
- Durga!

43
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,522
Yes, Young King.

44
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:57,056
You didn't call for me that
is why I have come.

45
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,536
Why would I call for you?

46
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:02,776
Have you forgotten? Isn't
that what you said?

47
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:05,847
I said it and you believed me,
did you?

48
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,614
What about the sacred circles
in front of God.

49
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:12,375
Was that just for show?
Was that a farce?

50
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:18,615
Durga, depending on the kinds of
girls I am forced to set the net.

51
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:22,536
Some are pleased by money.
Some with gifts.

52
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:27,151
But you? You were very different
from all of them.

53
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:31,536
That is why I had to go through
the sham of marriage with you.

54
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:37,376
Look, Durga. The night is passed
and so it the matter.

55
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,427
The night has not passed,
Young King.

56
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:44,367
That night is taken shape
of your heir in my womb.

57
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:47,055
I am going to be a mother
to your child.

58
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,896
My child? What proof do you have?

59
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,656
God knows that..

60
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,937
Which God are you talking about?

61
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:58,855
Is it the same God who has to leave
the precincts of a temple..

62
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:01,736
..to come to my door step
and give blessings?

63
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:05,376
Trust me. The baby in
my womb is yours.

64
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,998
How do I believe that
this child is mine?

65
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:14,024
Who knows who else has fathered
that bastard before me?

66
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:15,296
Ranvir!

67
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,216
What is the matter?

68
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:30,375
Raja Sir, this woman bears
somebody's child and..

69
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:32,415
..wants to blame Young King for it.

70
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,415
She shouts. She says that..

71
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:36,496
Lala! Go inside.

72
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:49,056
King! King! This is not a sin.

73
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:51,936
This is the blood of your clan.

74
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:56,376
Don't give such a harsh punishment..

75
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,453
..to the innocent child
that is not born yet.

76
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:04,415
Please do justice. Please
do justice, Raja Sir.

77
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,349
Justice will be done
to you! Surely!

78
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:34,616
No! No! Leave me!

79
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:36,096
My baby!

80
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:43,497
Didn't you say that it
was my brother's sin?

81
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:46,376
Now it has been washed off.

82
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:02,256
Tyrants! You have
harassed me a lot!

83
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:05,582
You have bestowed on
me many cruelties.

84
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:11,696
You forgot that when the chest
of a destitute cracks..

85
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:17,056
..then pain comes out of it
and the agony reaches God!

86
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:20,696
And it befalls you in
the form of mayhem..

87
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:25,256
..and shatters your hollow
flamboyance to smithereens!

88
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:29,896
Each and every curse of mine will
hit you like the cane of God.

89
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:34,776
Just like this unfortunate woman
pleads in front of you for her..

90
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:38,631
..esteem one day you
too will implore..

91
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,159
..to some wretched being
for your life.

92
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,969
But you will not get the alms.
Never get the alms you seek.

93
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:51,176
You have washed your floor with
my blood, Ranvir Singh!

94
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:53,776
I shall wash my hair
with your blood.

95
00:08:55,416 --> 00:09:00,696
Till such time that my words don't
come true I shall not tie my hair!

96
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:08,016
Someday a light from a hut will
set fire to this palace of yours.

97
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:12,856
And in that fire your
ego will burn to ashes!

98
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:19,297
Brijraj Singh! This is my curse!
This is my curse!

99
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,136
This is my curse!

100
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,496
Brother Ajay! Brother Ajay!

101
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:16,576
Rupaiyya, has picked up a fight
with his father again. Come fast.

102
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,633
I feel that probably
you are not my son.

103
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,709
I too feel that you
are not my father

104
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,766
I am not at all your father.

105
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:39,535
The man who raises his voice
against the Raja Sir!

106
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,856
The man challenges the
rule of Raja Sir!

107
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,296
lf my offspring wants
to marry that man's..

108
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,935
..daughter then I'd rather
disown that offspring.

109
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:50,175
I too had promised my
dead mother that..

110
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:52,296
..I would not marry
without your consent.

111
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,697
Otherwise I would not
accept your domination!

112
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,935
After all these years of being
a sidekick to Raja Sir..

113
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:58,376
How dare you call your
father a sidekick?

114
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,016
What else can I call you?
What do you say, Gullu?

115
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,656
Yes, because..

116
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,215
Raja gave Lala the chutney..

117
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,776
..to taste from a silver spoon.

118
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:10,462
Shut up! How dare
you poke fun at me?

119
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,864
Hey Rupaiyya! Why do you keep
fighting with your father?

120
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:20,095
He too doesn't give up on being
a supporter of Raja Sir.

121
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:22,736
How many times have I told him
to stand by truth not wealth?

122
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,400
Ajay Son, come and have your breakfast.
- Coming mother.

123
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:28,936
Lucky man!

124
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:35,856
There is no water.

125
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Thank you.

126
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,376
Mother! Listen!

127
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,857
Oh God! What is this
childish prank?

128
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,432
Mother, throw her out of the
house as soon as possible.

129
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,536
Get her married and send her away.

130
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:57,832
Come on have your breakfast. Come.

131
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:01,376
Mother, he keeps talking about
getting me married dawn to dusk.

132
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:02,776
Keeps talking about sending
me out of this house.

133
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:04,096
Mother, don't get carried
away by what she says.

134
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,456
As soon as possible get
her married to someone.

135
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,856
Anyone. Lame or cripple!
Maybe a horse or donkey!

136
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:08,935
Hey! I will get married
to somebody..

137
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:09,776
..who is lame or cripple.

138
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,336
And you will get married
to a princess.

139
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:13,057
Yes. I will get married
to a princess.

140
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:19,016
Why not? I will get married
to a princess only.

141
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,656
What is all this, uncle?

142
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:38,696
Rama, they all have come to
greet you, to welcome you.

143
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,179
To greet me!

144
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:44,951
Do I seem to be some show
piece to all of you?

145
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:47,302
I don't want anybody to welcome me.

146
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:50,576
Go and do your work. Out! Out!

147
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:52,695
But daughter, a welcoming
ceremony like this..

148
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:53,656
..is a part of our culture.

149
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,055
It is according to our
customs and traditions.

150
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:56,992
Hey, uncle! Customs and traditions!
- Yes.

151
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,913
Where is big uncle?
- He is inside.

152
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:01,256
Big uncle!
- Rama! Rama! My daughter!

153
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:04,109
How are you?
- I am very angry with you.

154
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,870
Why? - In which jungle
have you invited me?

155
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:08,456
This is such a boring place.

156
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:10,856
Hey! This time I will not
let you get bored at all.

157
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,536
Do you know why?

158
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:16,696
Because this time I have decided
to do your engagement.

159
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:19,256
Engagement! With whom?

160
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:21,176
With an Indian fellow!

161
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:24,576
I don't want to get
married so quickly.

162
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:27,216
Where am I asking you to
get married immediately?

163
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:29,415
Hey! You have come right now.
Roam about at different places.

164
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,496
Relax, Rama! Enjoy yourself.

165
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,136
Hey girl! Just take
Rama to her room.

166
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,710
Fine.

167
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,781
Brother, is this a girl
or some hurricane?

168
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,567
She will be like a hurricane only.

169
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,616
After all whose daughter is she!

170
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,137
The queen of dreams!

171
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,679
What are you staring at me for?
- Your beauty.

172
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,616
How dare you? Put me down.

173
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,696
Hey! You are very ungrateful to me!

174
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:43,896
First of all, I saved
you from drowning.

175
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:45,695
And on top of that, you
are yelling at me.

176
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:46,807
You would have drowned.

177
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:48,576
lf I had drowned then
I would have drowned.

178
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,015
Who are you to yell at me?

179
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:51,056
Just put me down.

180
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:53,291
I told you to put me down.

181
00:16:58,056 --> 00:16:59,456
Don't you know that who am I?

182
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,479
The queen of my dreams.

183
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:04,758
I am not the queen of dreams
but I am indeed a queen.

184
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:08,102
Whoever you are, I swear by
God that you are awesome.

185
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,736
I really feel like being
romantic with you.

186
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:13,696
But I am in a hurry.

187
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:15,702
We will meet again.

188
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:22,982
Madam! Madam!

189
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,655
Who is this beast?

190
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:28,765
Beast! He is not a beast.

191
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:30,006
But he is a human being.

192
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,359
And his name is Ajay.

193
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,776
All the girls in the village
are crazy about him.

194
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,296
But he never pays attention
to anybody.

195
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:39,296
Last year, during the ox fight,
he had only won.

196
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:41,416
And he will only win
this time also.

197
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:58,256
The inhabitants of Kishengadh,
with the blessings..

198
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:01,616
..of the great Thakur family,
like every year..

199
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:05,263
..even today I begin with
this cultural festival.

200
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:39,536
Wow! The king has nurtured
such a good ox.

201
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,415
Even the great men's are
unable to face him..

202
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,016
Yes! You are absolutely
right, father.

203
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:46,457
The king has nurtured such a great ox..
- Shut up!

204
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:13,975
Come, young men's! Come!

205
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:18,203
Is there any brave man who will
risk his life in danger?

206
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:21,696
Any young man who would
like to test his might?

207
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:24,024
Tell me, is there anybody?

208
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,416
Come on. Come on. Come forward.

209
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,482
Is there any such young man?

210
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,816
Uncle, I will come back right now.

211
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:34,294
Is there anybody who will be
able to handle this beast?

212
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:36,256
Tell me, is there anybody?

213
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,456
I think that there is nobody.

214
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:43,776
Nobody! Is there nobody who will
be able to handle this beats?

215
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:48,136
I think that indeed there is
no real man in this city.

216
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:52,776
You should not challenge
the manhood of men's.

217
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:54,256
Let go of my hand.

218
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,296
I told you to let go of my hand.

219
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,950
Not throughout my entire life.

220
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,839
lf you want to prove your manhood..

221
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,736
..then first of all, triumph
in this competition.

222
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:07,136
You will get whatever
you will ask for.

223
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:11,798
Really! What can you offer as reward?
- 50000 rupees.

224
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:14,631
This reward is very ordinary.

225
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,136
What I want is..

226
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:33,696
What happened?

227
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:34,856
Look, my friend is going.

228
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,456
Foolish guy! Even he will lose.

229
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:39,776
Father, let's have a bet.
- What is the bet?

230
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:43,336
lf Ajay will win then I will
myself blacken your face.

231
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:45,216
And if that ox will win then?

232
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,657
Then blacken yourself
by you won hands.

233
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:54,375
Hey! Today this ox will teach a
very good lesson to your friend.

234
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,736
The ox has already frightened.

235
00:21:56,374 --> 00:21:57,974
Are you calling your dad an ox?

236
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:47,336
Ajay! Ajay!

237
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:52,343
Ajay! Ajay!

238
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,136
Ajay! Ajay!

239
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:57,016
Ajay! Ajay!

240
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,040
Ajay! Ajay!

241
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,001
Ajay! Ajay!

242
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,482
Ajay! Ajay!

243
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:04,883
Ajay! Ajay!

244
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:07,604
Ajay! Ajay!

245
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,042
Ajay! Ajay!

246
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,055
Ajay! Ajay!

247
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:14,056
Ajay! Ajay!

248
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:16,537
Ajay! Ajay!

249
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,818
Ajay! Ajay!

250
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,994
Ajay! Ajay!

251
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,106
Ajay! Ajay!

252
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:25,603
Ajay! Ajay!

253
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,715
Ajay! Ajay!

254
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:44,793
Hey! What are you doing?

255
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:45,923
I have blackened your face.

256
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:48,795
Hey, foolish guy! Are you
blackening your father's face?

257
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,601
"You have a beautiful face."

258
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:57,122
"Your eyes are deep blue."

259
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,356
"You have an exclusively
splendid hair."

260
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:01,826
"I am watching it."

261
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:07,359
"The way you laugh,
the way you walk."

262
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,674
"The way you change your colors."

263
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,905
"I am watching it."

264
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:17,343
"In the skies, in this
entire universe."

265
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:22,273
"There is nobody like you."

266
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:25,440
"You have a beautiful face."

267
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,397
"Your eyes are deep blue."

268
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:30,089
"You have an exclusively
splendid hair."

269
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,103
"I am watching it."

270
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:37,801
"The way you laugh,
the way you walk."

271
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:40,361
"The way you change your colors."

272
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:43,016
"I am watching it."

273
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,969
"The way you sway your
veil in the air.."

274
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,810
"..then the days of brightness
are here."

275
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:55,041
"The way you swing and move
around in the cold breeze.."

276
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:58,752
"..the days of scenic
beauty are here."

277
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:05,440
"Shall I call it a season
or a fragrance?"

278
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:09,681
"Shall I call it frolic or miracle?"

279
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:15,200
"The way you come, the way you go."

280
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:17,391
"The way you take away my heart."

281
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:19,822
"I am watching it."

282
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:25,222
"In the skies, in the
entire universe."

283
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:30,344
"There is nobody like you."

284
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,467
"You have a beautiful face."

285
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,401
"Your eyes are deep blue."

286
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:38,113
"You have an exclusively
splendid hair."

287
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:41,001
"I am watching it."

288
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:37,361
"You are the first desires
of my eyes."

289
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:41,121
"You are unaware about it."

290
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:47,373
"You may make anybody
go crazy for you."

291
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,201
"This is your specialty."

292
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:57,841
"I have gone crazy, O my beloved!"

293
00:28:58,106 --> 00:29:02,346
"I have been wounded for
the first time today."

294
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:07,321
"Your anklet, your kohl."

295
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:10,455
"This beautiful veil."

296
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,881
"I am watching it."

297
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:18,072
"In the skies, in the
entire universe."

298
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:23,327
"There is nobody like you."

299
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,831
"You have a beautiful face."

300
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:28,312
"Your eyes are deep blue."

301
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:30,393
"You have an exclusively
splendid hair."

302
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,927
"I am watching it."

303
00:29:33,654 --> 00:29:38,574
"The way you laugh,
the way you walk."

304
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,848
"The way you change your colors."

305
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,792
"I am watching it."

306
00:29:58,232 --> 00:30:00,632
Brother. Get up, brother.

307
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:02,592
Please get up. Please. Get up.

308
00:30:03,992 --> 00:30:05,592
Were you seeing some
beautiful dream?

309
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:07,152
It is so late now.

310
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:08,505
Don't you want to go to work today?

311
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:10,672
Please get up.

312
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:18,592
Hey! Mother!

313
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,472
Mother!
- Yes.

314
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:24,832
Live long, son! Live long!

315
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:39,912
Be careful! Be careful, son Ajay!

316
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,301
Otherwise the milk will spill over.

317
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:54,472
Sister, just a minute. I will
just go and come back soon.

318
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,767
Hey madam! Why did you
shatter my milk cans?

319
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,470
Why did you tie my scarf on your car?
- To wipe my nose.

320
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:57,878
How dare you!

321
00:31:57,926 --> 00:31:58,966
Don't you know that who am I?

322
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:00,952
I know that who are you, madam.

323
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:03,776
But maybe you don't know
that who are you?

324
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:06,342
I will have to remind you.

325
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:08,351
Let go for me.

326
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:09,592
I will get you imprisoned.

327
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:14,358
Where are you taking me?
- To your in-law's house.

328
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:22,471
Open my hands. Open my hands.

329
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:28,312
Why did you bring me over here?

330
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:30,711
You have made my loss. You will
have to compensate for it.

331
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:31,886
I will not compensate for it.

332
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,431
You know to make losses
but don't you know..

333
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:34,672
..how to compensate for it?
- No!

334
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:36,223
How will you not compensate
for it? Come on.

335
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:40,352
Let go of my hands.

336
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,592
No! No!

337
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,432
Let go of me.

338
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:16,872
No! Let go of me.

339
00:33:33,832 --> 00:33:34,872
I will fix you.

340
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:38,198
I will teach you a lesson.

341
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,272
'You have made my loss. You will
have to compensate for it.

342
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:54,311
'You know to make losses
but don't you know..

343
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:55,432
..how to compensate for it?

344
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:57,263
'How will you not compensate
for it? Come on.

345
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,168
Sister! What are you doing?

346
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:08,272
Don't ask me anything.

347
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:14,151
Are you squeezing the milk?
- Yes, I am doing that only.

348
00:34:14,192 --> 00:34:16,472
So did he teach you to squeeze
out the milk also?

349
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,159
What will he teach me?

350
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:22,702
Let the right time come.

351
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:26,431
I will teach him such a lesson that
he will always remember it.

352
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:28,072
What will you teach him a lesson?

353
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:31,495
He has taught you many more things.

354
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:35,712
Lala! Hey Lala! Lala!
-What is the matter?

355
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:38,231
Lala! Some people have come
from the village. -For what?

356
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:39,352
Lala! To ask you for charity.

357
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:41,527
To ask for charity! Tell them that
I am not there in the house.

358
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:43,846
But Lala, I have already told
them that you are at home.

359
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:56,136
Hey Lala! What are you doing,
Lala? -Suicide.

360
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:58,335
Suicide! Hey! Hey!

361
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,951
Hey! What do I tell all of you,
young men's of the village?

362
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,152
I have been ruined. I am broke.

363
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:05,233
I have lost everything in gambling.

364
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:12,712
But why have all of
you come over here?

365
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,320
To ask for alms. Tomorrow is
'Janmaashthami', isn't it?

366
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:16,871
Alms. Will you all ask for
alms from a poor person?

367
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:18,392
Will you all ask for alms
from a poor person?

368
00:35:18,512 --> 00:35:20,192
Wait. Wait. Wait. I will
give you some charity.

369
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,672
Until today, people have
fulfilled the ritual..

370
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:22,672
..of giving away of the daughter.

371
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,272
Today I will give away my son.

372
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:28,432
Anyway, my son is completely
useless to me.

373
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:30,912
Take him away as charity. Go.

374
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:32,912
But Lala. Lala -Hey, Lala!

375
00:35:32,953 --> 00:35:34,953
We don't want any charity.

376
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:36,392
Why are you all wasting
you time over here?

377
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:37,951
You all will not get any
charity over here.

378
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:38,992
Go away. Go away.

379
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:40,152
Where have they come
to ask for alms?

380
00:35:40,352 --> 00:35:43,791
They have come to ask
for alms from a beggar.

381
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:46,352
Hey! Get lost! Get lost!

382
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:52,542
They have come to ask
for alms from Lala!

383
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,000
You don't have money, right?

384
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,392
I will teach you
a lesson right now.

385
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:56,887
Just wait for some time.

386
00:35:56,928 --> 00:35:58,386
40, 41 .

387
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,192
Dacoit!
- Dacoit!

388
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:13,552
The dacoits are here!

389
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:21,231
Hey! Come on, hurry up!

390
00:36:21,272 --> 00:36:23,112
Hurry up! Take out the
money! Take it out!

391
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:24,536
Hey! I don't have anything.
I don't have anything.

392
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:25,752
Just take it out. Come on. Quickly.

393
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,800
'What is there inside your pajama?'

394
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:30,321
'What is there inside your pajama?'

395
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,272
There is nothing in
the pajama, my son.'

396
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:33,992
There is nothing in the
pajama, O dacoit.'

397
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:35,712
You are telling lies, father.'

398
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:38,072
'Open up. Open up
your pajama first.

399
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,033
Come on, open it. Open it quickly.

400
00:36:44,072 --> 00:36:45,592
Is this much sufficient?
This much is sufficient.

401
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:50,038
You? -Thank you!

402
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:51,352
Run! Run!

403
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:53,872
You have tried to ruin Lala, right?

404
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:59,592
lf I will also not ruin your life
then I will change my name.

405
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:28,559
Priest. Priest. Please open
the doors of the temple.

406
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:31,632
Look, the time for Lord Krishna's
birth is passing away.

407
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:34,734
What are you saying, daughter?
Like every year,..

408
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,111
..the king will only open
the door this time also.

409
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:39,031
Hey! But if the king will not..

410
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:40,912
.. come then will the
God not be born?

411
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,352
Can he God's birth wait for anybody?

412
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:44,593
It can wait for us.

413
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:54,672
Who are you? And how did
you dare to step..

414
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:56,832
..on the stairs of our temple?

415
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:58,591
But the temple belongs to God.

416
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:00,166
The temple may be of the God but..

417
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:02,134
..it has been built with our money.

418
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:05,252
lf you were so keen
to built a temple..

419
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:07,253
..then you should have built
it in your palace.

420
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,399
The temple belongs to everybody.

421
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,893
And anybody can climb its stairs.

422
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:14,472
A rich person as well
as a poor person.

423
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:18,221
Okay. So you are very
fond of arguing.

424
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:23,547
Come on. Then argue with me.

425
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:26,349
Let go of me. Let go of me.

426
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:28,231
I told you to let go of me.

427
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,512
Hey! Come on.
-Brother!

428
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:02,735
Ajay! Son Ajay, stop! Stop!

429
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,078
Please leave him. Ajay!

430
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,233
What are you doing?
- Leave him, brother.

431
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:11,367
Mother, how did he touch my sister?
- Ranvir! Stop!

432
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:12,752
Let go of him.
- Let go of him.

433
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:13,671
Let it be, son. You should
not shed blood..

434
00:39:13,712 --> 00:39:16,352
..on the stairs of the temple.
- A tiger doesn't compete with a dog.

435
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:18,223
Listen to me. You have my sake.

436
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:22,192
Come on, let it be. Let's go.

437
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:25,192
Let's go. Let's go.

438
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,039
Son Ajay! Are you angry
with your mother?

439
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,959
By the way, shall I
tell you something?

440
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,719
I have experienced
life more than you.

441
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:55,935
The people against whom
you were fighting..

442
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,032
..it will be better to
stay away from them.

443
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:02,343
Anyway, it is said that we
should not play with fire.

444
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,992
Ajay! Ajay! What did you do, my son?

445
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,750
Mother, I know how to
play with the fire.

446
00:40:15,072 --> 00:40:16,312
And I know how to
extinguish it also.

447
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:53,128
Oh! The princess of dreams!

448
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,150
I have come to explain
the reality to you.

449
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,592
Did you see that your
reality is at my feet?

450
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:11,815
By the way, this net
is very beautiful.

451
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,078
You will not be able to
free yourself from it.

452
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:17,050
By the way, who wants
to come out of it?

453
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,411
It is the dirt of your mind.

454
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:22,032
After all, what is your status
and what is my status?

455
00:41:22,632 --> 00:41:26,032
I am that princess who stays
in the heights of the skies.

456
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:29,992
And you are an ordinary worm
who crawls on the ground.

457
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:33,312
You will never be able to
wipe out these differences.

458
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:35,552
By wearing a show which has
a heel of four inch high..

459
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:37,512
..nobody is able to touch
the skies, madam.

460
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:39,112
When you will fall down then..

461
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:40,952
..this land will only
take care of you.

462
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:43,598
We will watch out the consequences
at that time.

463
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:46,552
But today you are at the
stage of my mercy.

464
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:49,471
Listen to me. The way I am trapped..

465
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:51,952
..it is not my helplessness
but it is my wish.

466
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:52,912
What do you mean?

467
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:54,352
You will come to know
about it right now.

468
00:41:56,832 --> 00:41:57,832
Get him!

469
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:40,470
Stupid fools!

470
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,512
Salutations, brother!
- Salutations!

471
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:51,047
What is the matter, brother?

472
00:42:51,408 --> 00:42:52,808
When you come across
a valley or a lake..

473
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,473
..just throw these boys into it.

474
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,432
Fine. Come on, child.

475
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,152
Come on, child.

476
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:23,536
"O pretty Damsel!"

477
00:43:24,712 --> 00:43:28,112
"O pretty Damsel!"

478
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:31,375
"O pretty Damsel!"

479
00:43:31,456 --> 00:43:32,896
"O pretty Damsel!"

480
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,231
"Please walk a bit slowly."

481
00:43:35,272 --> 00:43:37,672
"Please walk a bit slowly."

482
00:43:38,194 --> 00:43:40,194
"O pretty Damsel!"

483
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,928
"O pretty Damsel!"

484
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:44,145
"Please walk a bit slowly."

485
00:43:44,272 --> 00:43:47,072
"Please walk a bit slowly."

486
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:51,265
"Otherwise you will slip away."

487
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,871
"Otherwise you will slip away."

488
00:43:55,912 --> 00:43:59,272
"And your thin waist
will be twisted."

489
00:44:00,256 --> 00:44:04,176
"And your thin waist
will be twisted."

490
00:44:05,032 --> 00:44:09,032
"O pretty Damsel!"

491
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:14,231
"O pretty Damsel!"

492
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:22,152
"I am a Punjabi boy."

493
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:27,916
"I am a Punjabi boy."

494
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,037
"Listen to me, you rich lady!"

495
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,560
"Today I will smatter the
glitters from your face."

496
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:41,345
"I am a Punjabi boy."

497
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:43,546
"Listen to me, you rich lady!"

498
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:47,856
"Today I will smatter the
glitters from your face."

499
00:44:47,897 --> 00:44:50,297
"I will come to your house with
the musical procession."

500
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:52,631
"I will bring the horses and
elephants also along with me."

501
00:44:52,672 --> 00:44:54,591
"I will come very pompously
as a King to your house."

502
00:44:54,632 --> 00:44:57,272
"I will make you my queen."

503
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:01,351
"I will show you those
colors that.."

504
00:45:01,392 --> 00:45:04,992
"..you will never forget
it throughout your life."

505
00:45:05,752 --> 00:45:09,552
"That you will not forget
it throughout your life."

506
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:14,192
"O pretty Damsel!"

507
00:45:15,368 --> 00:45:20,008
"O pretty Damsel!"

508
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:54,908
"Why are you so engrossed?"

509
00:45:55,643 --> 00:46:00,426
"Why are you so engrossed,
you silly girl?"

510
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:04,947
"You are the bolt of fire.
I am the chilled water."

511
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:13,937
"Why are you so engrossed,
you silly girl?"

512
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:18,107
"You are the bolt of fire.
I am the chilled water."

513
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:20,347
"lf you will break my heart and go"

514
00:46:20,388 --> 00:46:22,868
"then you will not be
peaceful at all."

515
00:46:23,057 --> 00:46:27,457
"It is my confidence that you
will definitely come back."

516
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:31,629
"You will suffer and
you will regret."

517
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,030
"Gain your consciousness,
you silly girl!"

518
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:39,869
"Gain your consciousness,
you silly girl!"

519
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,916
"O pretty Damsel!"

520
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,820
"O pretty Damsel!"

521
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,950
"Please walk a bit slowly."

522
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:49,925
"Please walk a bit slowly."

523
00:46:50,229 --> 00:46:54,629
"Otherwise you will slip away."

524
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:58,469
"Otherwise you will slip away."

525
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:02,189
"And your thin waist
will be twisted."

526
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:06,957
"And your thin waist
will be twisted."

527
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,725
"O pretty Damsel!"

528
00:47:12,717 --> 00:47:17,036
"O pretty Damsel!"

529
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:32,314
I hate him! I hate him! I hate him!

530
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:33,429
Sister, your juice.

531
00:47:35,308 --> 00:47:36,508
So you were involved with the..

532
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,269
..enemy and you were
fooling with me.

533
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:44,189
What do you think and what does
he think that we will bow down?

534
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:46,309
Love never bends, sister.

535
00:47:47,146 --> 00:47:50,226
A woman may stay in a poor
man's hut or in the palace.

536
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:53,469
But she is always preferred
with her eyes bowed low.

537
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:58,325
But I am not that girl who will
bow down. I will only win.

538
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:00,469
Not that Ajay!

539
00:48:06,557 --> 00:48:10,597
Greetings, Raja sir.
- My blessings, Rupesh.

540
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:14,445
I've called you here because
I want that before the..

541
00:48:14,486 --> 00:48:18,046
..engagement you and Rama should
know each other well.

542
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:20,519
Okay, Raja sir.

543
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:24,526
Come, Rama, come. Come, dear.

544
00:48:25,582 --> 00:48:27,560
Look, the pride of Bhavanipur..

545
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:29,548
..has come to meet the
life of Kishengadh.

546
00:48:30,926 --> 00:48:34,606
Hello. - But, uncle, I
didn't recognize him.

547
00:48:34,925 --> 00:48:38,725
Dear, he is Bhavanipur
Industries' owner..

548
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:41,846
..Kedarnath's only son, Rupesh.

549
00:48:42,246 --> 00:48:43,806
Your marriage has been
fixed with him only.

550
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:45,974
But, uncle, I don't even know..

551
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:49,206
I was going to the jungle with
my friends for hunting..

552
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:51,742
Hunting!
- Yes. - How exciting!

553
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:54,965
You hunt?
- Yes, why?

554
00:48:56,526 --> 00:49:02,646
Even I very much feel like
hunting a wild animal.

555
00:49:02,726 --> 00:49:04,966
Oh, really! Then come with us.

556
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:08,402
With this pretext your wish of
hunting will also be fulfilled..

557
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,050
..and we'll also know
each other well.

558
00:49:11,758 --> 00:49:15,446
Am I right Raja sir?
- Why not. Rama will surely come.

559
00:49:17,295 --> 00:49:18,255
Hunting.

560
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:45,406
Hey, milkman!
- You!

561
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:48,606
You're here so early
in the morning.

562
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:53,206
It looks like in the eagerness
of meeting me..

563
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:55,246
..you didn't sleep at night.

564
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:59,639
Yes, I didn't sleep the whole night.
I was missing you.

565
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:02,206
And as soon as, the sun rose..

566
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:05,327
..I came to tell you that now
for the rest of your life..

567
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:07,528
..you won't be able
to sleep at night.

568
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:11,886
Okay.
- I'm getting married.

569
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:13,926
Our marriage! So soon!

570
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:18,742
I've still not spoke with
mother about this.

571
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,295
You're mistaken.

572
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:22,885
I'm getting married to..

573
00:50:22,926 --> 00:50:24,926
..Bhavanipur's Prince Rupesh Singh.

574
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:31,581
Why? How did you find it?

575
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:37,326
And how dare you dream
of marring me!

576
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:40,638
My body, mind will
be his possession.

577
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:43,406
He'll be the protector
of my honour, respect.

578
00:50:44,422 --> 00:50:46,542
My each and every
breath will be his.

579
00:50:47,886 --> 00:50:50,686
And each night when you'll
be agonising for me..

580
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:53,678
..I'll be in his strong arms.

581
00:50:53,806 --> 00:50:56,446
My palanquin will pass your house.

582
00:50:57,046 --> 00:50:59,166
And you won't be able
to do anything.

583
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:02,262
You like to be Ranjah, don't you?

584
00:51:03,462 --> 00:51:05,862
So today I'll make you
Majnu from Kehes.

585
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:09,901
That Majnu, who never got Laila.

586
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:12,846
That Majnu who wandered
in the desert.

587
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:14,487
Whom the people threw stones at.

588
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:19,799
And the foolish Laila saved
his Majnu from the stones.

589
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:23,926
But I.. even I'll throw a stone.

590
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,430
Rupesh! Look, there!

591
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:14,766
Leave me! Leave me! Leave!

592
00:54:18,975 --> 00:54:23,575
Rupesh! Where are you taking me!

593
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:16,845
This is the Prince, isn't he?

594
00:55:17,287 --> 00:55:20,287
Whose strong arms will protect
you for the entire life!

595
00:55:20,598 --> 00:55:24,158
What is entire life! He couldn't
even protect you for a night.

596
00:55:24,974 --> 00:55:27,894
Girls like you, who don't
care for other's honour..

597
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:30,486
..their guardian of honour
will be people like him.

598
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:34,046
What will you reject my love!

599
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:38,166
You are not even worthy for
my hatred, leave aside love.

600
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:56,606
Rama! Rama!

601
00:55:58,246 --> 00:56:00,446
Rama.. whatever happened
last night..

602
00:56:01,886 --> 00:56:04,446
..actually I wasn't
in my senses, Rama.

603
00:56:05,606 --> 00:56:07,926
I apologize for my friends'
misbehavior. Rama!

604
00:56:10,812 --> 00:56:11,932
Misbehavior!

605
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:14,205
I thought that this must be..

606
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,446
..some great tradition
of your family.

607
00:56:16,965 --> 00:56:18,245
That the bride has to
first be the keep..

608
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:19,686
..of the bridegroom's friends.

609
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:20,886
Rama!
- Don't shout!

610
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:25,126
When weak people like
you are reminded of..

611
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:28,847
..their weakness they can do
nothing but raise their voice.

612
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:31,086
You're crossing your limits, Rama!

613
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:34,406
Don't forget that you're my fiancé!

614
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:37,046
Fiancé! And that too yours!

615
00:56:37,486 --> 00:56:42,006
lf my uncle comes to know
what Bhavanipur's pride..

616
00:56:42,047 --> 00:56:44,327
..did with the life of Kishengadh..

617
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:47,029
..then there will be bloodsheds.

618
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:51,559
Along with Bhavanipur, he'll
also turn you into dust.

619
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:04,773
Rama.. how was your hunting?

620
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:09,302
Interesting. Very interesting.
- Indeed.

621
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,886
And Rupesh? How was he?

622
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:19,726
Uncle, in this hunt.. I
very well came to know..

623
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:22,927
..the difference between
lion and fox.

624
00:58:23,101 --> 00:58:25,301
Really! So what did you think?

625
00:58:26,429 --> 00:58:30,189
I didn't think, I've decided.

626
00:58:31,046 --> 00:58:34,926
Very good, so I'll..
- What's the hurry, uncle?

627
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,806
When the time comes I'll
tell you that.. - That..

628
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:43,317
When the time comes.

629
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,406
Hit her more! Hit! Hit
her more! Hit her!

630
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:05,846
Hit! Hit! Don't leave her! Hit her!

631
00:59:06,063 --> 00:59:09,223
Hit her more! Hit! Hit
her more! Hit her!

632
00:59:09,366 --> 00:59:13,886
Hit her more! Hit! Hit
her more! Hit her!

633
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:17,734
Stop! Why are you hitting
her! What did she do?

634
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:21,624
What did she do! She has
become crazy, mad.

635
00:59:21,886 --> 00:59:24,206
Day and night she chants
the name of her lover.

636
00:59:24,286 --> 00:59:27,166
So what? We want to disown
her from the village.

637
00:59:27,246 --> 00:59:30,806
Don't you feel ashamed!
You want to disown a lover!

638
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:33,997
Why are you praising her
so much, Ajay brother?

639
00:59:34,076 --> 00:59:35,676
Because she has only loved..

640
00:59:37,446 --> 00:59:39,326
..she also gave her
heart to someone.

641
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:41,766
And to love is not a sin.

642
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:19,285
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

643
01:00:19,404 --> 01:00:21,804
"Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, lover."

644
01:00:21,845 --> 01:00:24,045
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

645
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,485
"Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, lover."

646
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:29,126
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

647
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,324
"Break and go away,
break and go away."

648
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:33,365
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

649
01:00:33,406 --> 01:00:35,845
"Tomorrow you read
in the newspaper."

650
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:37,953
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

651
01:00:37,994 --> 01:00:40,437
"Tomorrow you read
in the newspaper."

652
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:45,285
"As a lover, has died."

653
01:00:45,326 --> 01:00:47,663
"As a lover, has died."

654
01:00:47,704 --> 01:00:49,914
"A woman in love for her love."

655
01:00:50,136 --> 01:00:52,207
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

656
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,768
"Tomorrow you read
in the newspaper."

657
01:00:54,926 --> 01:00:56,926
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

658
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:59,527
"Tomorrow you read
in the newspaper."

659
01:00:59,568 --> 01:01:03,848
"As a lover, has died."

660
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:06,492
"As a lover, has died."

661
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:09,004
"A woman in love for her love."

662
01:01:09,045 --> 01:01:11,324
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

663
01:01:11,365 --> 01:01:13,685
"Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, lover."

664
01:01:13,805 --> 01:01:16,045
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

665
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:18,686
"Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop."

666
01:02:03,457 --> 01:02:05,657
"I became crazy in love."

667
01:02:08,165 --> 01:02:10,419
"Unknown, stranger."

668
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:15,357
"By stealing my heart,
going away from me.."

669
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,398
"..why do you do this naive thing?"

670
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,407
"By stealing my heart,
going away from me.."

671
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:22,288
"..why do you do this naive thing?"

672
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:26,609
"What I don't have!"

673
01:02:26,989 --> 01:02:31,509
"This youth is in your name."

674
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:36,515
"Such a lover won't
be in this world."

675
01:02:36,565 --> 01:02:38,525
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

676
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:40,766
"Tomorrow you read
in the newspaper."

677
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:43,124
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

678
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:45,685
"Tomorrow you read
in the newspaper."

679
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,213
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

680
01:02:48,254 --> 01:02:50,614
"Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, lover."

681
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:52,815
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

682
01:02:53,147 --> 01:02:55,535
"Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop."

683
01:03:40,935 --> 01:03:50,095
"People only say..
they don't do it."

684
01:03:50,398 --> 01:03:59,118
"Nowadays people don't
die in love."

685
01:04:04,024 --> 01:04:06,304
"Leave my arms."

686
01:04:08,693 --> 01:04:10,777
"Leave my arms."

687
01:04:13,576 --> 01:04:18,256
"Every day new rumours are
published in the newspaper."

688
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:22,777
"Every day new rumours are
published in the newspaper."

689
01:04:23,001 --> 01:04:31,921
"Leave me, give up this intention."

690
01:04:32,254 --> 01:04:37,774
"Why do you unnecessarily
talk about dying?"

691
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:55,759
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

692
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:58,456
"Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, lover."

693
01:04:58,497 --> 01:05:00,552
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

694
01:05:00,593 --> 01:05:02,993
"Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, lover."

695
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:05,211
"Today you break my
heart and go away."

696
01:05:05,259 --> 01:05:07,939
"Tomorrow you read
in the newspaper."

697
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,544
"As a lover, has died."

698
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:15,020
"As a lover, has died."

699
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:17,270
"A man in love for her love."

700
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,511
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

701
01:05:19,552 --> 01:05:21,912
"Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, lover."

702
01:05:21,953 --> 01:05:24,153
"Stop, lover. Stop, lover."

703
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:26,713
"Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop."

704
01:05:37,677 --> 01:05:39,397
I knew from before only,
the person who has..

705
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:42,731
..connections with the royal
family, if my daughter..

706
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,477
..goes in such a family as
their daughter-in-law..

707
01:05:46,518 --> 01:05:48,518
..then it will be a fortunate
thing for us.

708
01:05:48,566 --> 01:05:49,317
True, true.

709
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,690
And Lala, your son
is one in a million.

710
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:54,811
And what to say about his style.

711
01:05:55,143 --> 01:05:57,943
Your son is a treasure
box of virtues.

712
01:06:00,613 --> 01:06:01,733
He is a treasure box.

713
01:06:02,148 --> 01:06:05,428
That's why I've kept
his name as Rupaiya.

714
01:06:06,661 --> 01:06:09,981
But there is a problem.
- Problem? - Yes.

715
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:14,037
Look, God has given
me a gem of a son.

716
01:06:14,078 --> 01:06:16,678
Now I don't want anything.

717
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:21,373
What do they say.. dowry.
I'm completely against dowry.

718
01:06:21,471 --> 01:06:22,791
I don't want dowry.

719
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:27,725
Only weigh my gem of
son with diamond..

720
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:29,629
..or at least with gold.

721
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:31,622
With gold?
- Yes.

722
01:06:32,349 --> 01:06:36,509
Okay not gold, at least
weigh him with silver.

723
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:41,450
Silver? - Not even silver.
Then weigh him with money.

724
01:06:42,238 --> 01:06:44,758
With money?
- What penniless people are you!

725
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:46,597
You don't have money and you want..

726
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:47,798
..your daughter to marry my son.

727
01:06:48,678 --> 01:06:50,718
Get out from here! Go on your way!

728
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,558
Will my son go in such
a penniless house..

729
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:53,879
..as a live in son-in-law?

730
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:57,838
I've not kept his name
Rupaiya just like that.

731
01:07:02,013 --> 01:07:02,773
What are you thinking about?

732
01:07:04,655 --> 01:07:06,535
The person who is an orphan
since her childhood..

733
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,552
..and now she is suddenly
getting a mother.

734
01:07:10,215 --> 01:07:13,920
I fear that if mother will
not accept me then?

735
01:07:15,575 --> 01:07:17,135
I have complete faith
on my love and..

736
01:07:17,176 --> 01:07:19,536
..my mother has complete
trust on my faith.

737
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:12,862
Bhatwari, this place
is very beautiful.

738
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:14,999
I like it very much.

739
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:19,839
Whoever it belongs to, just tell
him that I have brought it.

740
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:24,431
Bhatwari, that car which is parked
there is very beautiful.

741
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:26,349
I like it very much.

742
01:08:27,455 --> 01:08:30,055
Whoever it belongs to, tell
him that I have brought it.

743
01:08:30,559 --> 01:08:32,158
This car belongs to me.

744
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,198
And this land belongs to me.
And it is not saleable.

745
01:08:35,535 --> 01:08:37,468
You are challenging my power.

746
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,958
I know how to steal it also.

747
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:44,838
Only time will prove it that who
will steal what and from whom?

748
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:57,993
lf you got scared so soon then
how will you support me..

749
01:08:58,479 --> 01:08:59,679
..throughout your life?

750
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,599
I have fallen in love.

751
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:07,439
But what will be its consequences?

752
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:09,719
I have not thought about it at all.

753
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,399
It is possible that maybe
I will not be able to..

754
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,319
..carry on this relationship.

755
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:15,759
You cannot carry on with it!

756
01:09:16,502 --> 01:09:17,822
Then why are falling into
this relationship?

757
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,479
In order to betray me!

758
01:09:19,919 --> 01:09:21,479
In order to promise me and
then break the promise!

759
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:34,822
I was just testing the
depth of your love.

760
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,598
I just wanted to see that
if I will change my mind..

761
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,439
..in some difficult situation then..

762
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:43,263
..will you let my love fall off?

763
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,030
Or will you handle it?

764
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:47,007
So have you tested my love?

765
01:09:47,638 --> 01:09:50,918
Ajay, the energy of your love has..

766
01:09:51,644 --> 01:09:53,804
..now become the test of my love.

767
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:01,483
I love you, Ajay! I love you!

768
01:10:11,779 --> 01:10:16,460
That rascal has maligned our
powers and insulted us.

769
01:10:17,194 --> 01:10:19,674
And you are asking me to have
patience. Why, brother?

770
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,363
We will definitely answer this.

771
01:10:22,604 --> 01:10:24,804
And we will answer it in our style.

772
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:25,885
When will we do say? When?

773
01:10:26,403 --> 01:10:28,763
When he would have already
maligned us badly then?

774
01:10:29,044 --> 01:10:32,244
He has already maligned the
respect of this family..

775
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:35,645
..by trapping Rama in his
love trap. - Rupesh!

776
01:10:36,764 --> 01:10:38,364
lf this will be proved
to be false then..

777
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:41,044
..blood will not shed from your
body but the bombs will.

778
01:10:41,835 --> 01:10:45,595
Save these bullets for him who
is trying to malign you.

779
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:49,427
There will be no use
of wasting it on me.

780
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:54,307
Rama who is the pride of this
family and my would-be fiancée..

781
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,924
..is having a good time in
his house and maligning..

782
01:10:58,027 --> 01:11:01,507
..the fame and pride
of this royal family.

783
01:11:13,354 --> 01:11:14,417
Mother!

784
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:17,073
Just see that who
has come to meet you?

785
01:11:21,755 --> 01:11:22,595
Rama!

786
01:11:25,204 --> 01:11:27,884
Mother.
- Live long, child!

787
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:30,772
You are very beautiful!

788
01:11:32,244 --> 01:11:33,964
Only fortunate people get a
daughter-in-law like this.

789
01:11:36,203 --> 01:11:38,363
But..
- I have understood it, mother.

790
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:42,324
You fear the king. And
you are my strength.

791
01:11:43,187 --> 01:11:48,707
But son, the king will never
accept this relationship.

792
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:50,819
Mother, God makes these
relationships, isn't it?

793
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,970
Why don't you understand?

794
01:12:02,122 --> 01:12:05,242
lf you're insistence and his pride
will lead to bloodshed then?

795
01:12:05,524 --> 01:12:08,164
Mother, I am ready for that also.

796
01:12:18,204 --> 01:12:21,644
It is fine. When you both
have decided to become on..

797
01:12:22,364 --> 01:12:25,164
..the my blessings will always
be with the two of you.

798
01:12:32,322 --> 01:12:34,762
I feel like making you my
daughter-in-law today itself.

799
01:12:34,804 --> 01:12:36,604
But sister-in-law, just a minute.

800
01:12:42,555 --> 01:12:44,235
Brother has one problem.

801
01:12:44,724 --> 01:12:45,844
He is of the opinion that..

802
01:12:45,885 --> 01:12:48,965
..until I don't get out from this
house he will not get married.

803
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:50,563
Your brother is absolutely right.

804
01:12:50,604 --> 01:12:53,204
O sister-in-law, even you have
been carried away by brother.

805
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:38,284
Rama!

806
01:13:49,684 --> 01:13:54,004
Until today, nobody dared
to look me into the eye.

807
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:58,145
Until today, nobody tried to malign
the pride of our family.

808
01:13:58,324 --> 01:14:02,524
Until today, nobody tried
to challenge my orders.

809
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:05,724
Until today, this has not happened.

810
01:14:06,163 --> 01:14:08,883
What has never happened, it
has happened today at least.

811
01:14:08,924 --> 01:14:11,884
Shut up! And bow your eyes low.

812
01:14:12,564 --> 01:14:14,084
Maybe you have forgotten
that who are we?

813
01:14:14,244 --> 01:14:17,724
You are the uncle of that
girl whom I love.

814
01:14:19,731 --> 01:14:21,131
It is good that you
all have come here.

815
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:24,027
Anyway, the girl's family only
comes with the proposal.

816
01:14:24,163 --> 01:14:27,083
Will you join a relationship
with our family? You?

817
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,043
Are you dreaming about wiping
out these distances..

818
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:30,124
..among our families?

819
01:14:30,602 --> 01:14:32,522
Love wipes out all the distances.

820
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:33,811
It can never happen.

821
01:14:34,163 --> 01:14:36,123
lf you will try to clear these
distances all your life..

822
01:14:36,164 --> 01:14:37,284
..then too these distances
will not be cleared.

823
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:39,484
We will not let you both unite.

824
01:14:40,524 --> 01:14:41,604
Deva!

825
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,834
I don't want any bloodshed
between us.

826
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,604
Rama and I love each
other very much.

827
01:14:54,844 --> 01:14:56,804
And no one can stop us from uniting.

828
01:15:06,164 --> 01:15:08,124
I'm handing over my
possession to you.

829
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:12,564
You've come to take Rama, take her.

830
01:15:13,684 --> 01:15:16,604
I'll come to take her.. along
with the wedding procession.

831
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:21,660
Ajay!

832
01:15:57,755 --> 01:16:00,675
You!
- Yes, that same wretch..

833
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:04,634
..whose first roar of curse
has befallen on you today.

834
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,769
Whose first drop of tears..

835
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:12,035
..showered on you today as acid.

836
01:16:16,515 --> 01:16:21,011
The curse from my heart
will destroy all of you.

837
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:29,410
There is no force left
in your slap, Ranbir.

838
01:16:30,195 --> 01:16:31,555
Hey, what are you looking?

839
01:16:31,866 --> 01:16:32,986
Use your strength and
remove the tree.

840
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:35,611
With your strength you'll
go away from here.

841
01:16:36,522 --> 01:16:38,842
But how will you face that storm..

842
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,955
..that is knocking on
your palace's door.

843
01:16:42,987 --> 01:16:43,747
Come on.

844
01:16:43,788 --> 01:16:47,028
Go, Raja sir, you'll be defeated.

845
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,106
You'll be defeated.

846
01:16:58,538 --> 01:17:04,498
Sir, sir. - Lala, what happened,
Lala? What happened?

847
01:17:04,555 --> 01:17:06,195
Did a mad dog bite you?

848
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:08,394
Sir, if you'd seen what I saw..

849
01:17:08,435 --> 01:17:10,075
..then even you would have
felt the same thing.

850
01:17:10,155 --> 01:17:12,395
What nonsense are you talking?
Are you in your right mind?

851
01:17:12,618 --> 01:17:14,618
Sir, last night I saw a dream.

852
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:18,594
Such a dream, o my God, that
even the 80 crores people..

853
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,795
..of India must have not seen it.
- What?

854
01:17:21,314 --> 01:17:23,434
Sir, the entire palace
is decorated..

855
01:17:23,475 --> 01:17:26,475
..as if the heavens have
come to your feet.

856
01:17:26,915 --> 01:17:29,475
Lakhs of guest, Indian
and foreigners.

857
01:17:29,955 --> 01:17:32,795
Sir's praises are sung
all over the place.

858
01:17:33,075 --> 01:17:36,115
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

859
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:38,916
Will you keep repeating sir
or say something further.

860
01:17:38,957 --> 01:17:42,954
Sir, I saw in my dream that
in Rama's marriage..

861
01:17:42,995 --> 01:17:46,755
..you had lost everything like
the King Harish Chandra..

862
01:17:47,146 --> 01:17:51,874
..and you were begging with
a beggar's bowl in your hand.

863
01:17:51,915 --> 01:17:54,155
What rubbish are you taking, Lala!

864
01:17:55,115 --> 01:17:56,698
Rama will get married.

865
01:17:57,235 --> 01:17:59,595
And it will be with such
a grandeur that..

866
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,035
..not only India's 80 crores but
the whole world will watch it.

867
01:18:02,867 --> 01:18:05,067
Not in dream.. but in reality.

868
01:18:05,395 --> 01:18:08,555
Sir, in my dream I saw that
when the bridegroom pushed..

869
01:18:08,596 --> 01:18:13,937
..aside his veil, it wasn't
Rupesh but that rascal Ajay.

870
01:18:13,978 --> 01:18:18,338
Lala! How dare you see such a dream!

871
01:18:18,475 --> 01:18:21,155
Sir, I think once more
my tongue slipped.

872
01:18:21,995 --> 01:18:24,155
lf next time your tongue slipped..

873
01:18:24,889 --> 01:18:26,569
..then I'll cut your tongue.

874
01:18:27,851 --> 01:18:29,691
Okay, come on Lala.

875
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:47,675
Raja sir, why such a big punishment
for my mistake?

876
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:50,938
Leave palace's dogs, beat
me with your slippers.

877
01:18:51,395 --> 01:18:54,074
But why are you making these
muscled men beat me?

878
01:18:54,115 --> 01:18:57,355
I have served you my whole life.
Forgive me, Raja sir.

879
01:18:57,835 --> 01:18:59,635
Come on, take the car back.
- Keep quiet.

880
01:19:01,315 --> 01:19:02,995
I've brought you here
not to beat you..

881
01:19:04,098 --> 01:19:05,578
..but for some other purpose.

882
01:19:06,802 --> 01:19:10,002
Go inside and tell Tiwari
that I want to meet him.

883
01:19:10,707 --> 01:19:12,349
I'll just tell him. Open the door.

884
01:19:14,659 --> 01:19:15,779
Where's Tiwari?

885
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:34,676
Where's Tiwari?..

886
01:19:41,555 --> 01:19:42,635
Where's Tiwari?

887
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:48,715
Hey, you, where's Tiwari?

888
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,595
I'm Tiwari. What purpose
brought you here?

889
01:19:55,827 --> 01:19:57,992
Raja sir has come to meet you.

890
01:19:58,033 --> 01:20:00,414
What! Raja sir has come here!

891
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:03,980
Yes, he is here.

892
01:20:05,978 --> 01:20:07,098
Greetings, Raja sir.

893
01:20:08,273 --> 01:20:10,273
How come today you remembered
this servant?

894
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:12,635
Tiwari there's an urgent
work to be done.

895
01:20:13,572 --> 01:20:15,452
That's why I've come to you.

896
01:20:17,195 --> 01:20:23,962
Some rascal has bellowed
my respect. And I want..

897
01:20:24,003 --> 01:20:27,163
I very well know what
you want, Raja sir.

898
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,117
I'll make his such condition
that after today..

899
01:20:30,675 --> 01:20:34,728
..he'll find himself
not on his two legs..

900
01:20:34,769 --> 01:20:36,889
..but on the four bed
poles of the hospital.

901
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:38,835
You tell me his name.
- Ajay.

902
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:44,370
The marriage's auspicious
date is fixed on the 12th.

903
01:20:45,418 --> 01:20:48,298
You all have only 10 days left
to do all the preparations.

904
01:20:48,497 --> 01:20:50,057
Uncle, you don't worry.

905
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:52,370
Even if the auspicious
day had been tomorrow..

906
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,115
..then too we would have
been ready for it.

907
01:20:54,675 --> 01:20:56,715
You just bring the marriage
procession.

908
01:20:56,995 --> 01:21:00,755
Very good, son.
Okay, son, okay, sister.

909
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:02,993
I'll take your leave. Greetings.
- Greetings.

910
01:21:06,345 --> 01:21:09,705
But Ajay, son, how can all
this be done so soon.

911
01:21:10,259 --> 01:21:13,219
Jewellery.. bride's dress.. are
still left to be purchased.

912
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:15,922
Then your pampered sister
should also like it.

913
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:17,882
Mother you don't worry
about anything.

914
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:19,779
All this will be done in a day.

915
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:23,219
But, brother, for me someone else..

916
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,180
..will select the marriage dress.
- Who?

917
01:21:30,442 --> 01:21:33,962
Hello. Hi, Anjali.
- Congratulations.

918
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:36,259
For you the doors of this house..

919
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:37,619
..are opening on the 12th.

920
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:40,866
Oh! It means your marriage has
been fixed for the 12th.

921
01:21:41,218 --> 01:21:42,878
And it's my wish that my
to be sister-in-law..

922
01:21:43,658 --> 01:21:46,738
..chooses the marriage dress for me.

923
01:21:46,779 --> 01:21:50,179
That's great! Tell your
brother that I'm coming.

924
01:21:50,499 --> 01:21:51,219
Just wait and see..

925
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,540
..what a gorgeous marriage
dress I select for you.

926
01:21:53,819 --> 01:21:57,739
Okay, bye.
- Where are you going?

927
01:21:58,362 --> 01:22:00,762
It is not necessary to tell
you everything. - Rama!

928
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:05,323
Rama! Rama!

929
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,400
Move aside!

930
01:22:09,626 --> 01:22:12,026
Brother, you know
where she is going.

931
01:22:12,339 --> 01:22:14,259
And still you're not stopping her.
- Let her go.

932
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,697
She should also see how the palace..

933
01:22:18,738 --> 01:22:21,898
..of her dreams shatters
in front of her own eyes.

934
01:22:22,912 --> 01:22:28,112
Look at this. No.
- No. - It isn't good. - No.

935
01:22:29,771 --> 01:22:32,251
How is this? No.

936
01:22:38,346 --> 01:22:39,546
This is injustice.

937
01:22:39,818 --> 01:22:41,058
For Anjali's marriage you selected..

938
01:22:41,099 --> 01:22:42,379
..everything of your own choice.

939
01:22:42,746 --> 01:22:44,746
Let your brother also
choose something.

940
01:22:45,105 --> 01:22:47,683
That wish you fulfill in
your own marriage, okay.

941
01:22:56,419 --> 01:22:59,819
Ajay! Ajay!

942
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:10,610
Ajay! Ajay, those people.

943
01:23:33,977 --> 01:23:35,097
Run! Run! Catch!

944
01:23:51,162 --> 01:23:53,402
Come! Come! Come! Beat us! Hit more!

945
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:03,674
Come on!

946
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,366
Stop!

947
01:25:50,816 --> 01:25:55,056
Why? No one till now has escaped
uninjured from Tiwari's gym.

948
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:56,856
You rascal!

949
01:25:57,534 --> 01:26:00,974
You're the one who made the
mistake of defying Raja sir.

950
01:26:07,735 --> 01:26:10,295
How dare you bellow his respect!

951
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:14,560
When in fact you're not even
worthy of looking at him.

952
01:26:22,753 --> 01:26:25,993
You'd got this vermillion
for your sister.

953
01:26:26,322 --> 01:26:28,642
I'll now use this for your funeral.

954
01:26:42,052 --> 01:26:46,114
And isn't this marriage
dress for your sister?

955
01:26:46,512 --> 01:26:52,032
In the open market,
I'll snatch it from her body.

956
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,360
And I'll mash her fair body.

957
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:28,130
Do you know why we worship him?

958
01:28:28,954 --> 01:28:30,274
Because he used all his strength..

959
01:28:30,315 --> 01:28:32,155
..to protect Sita mother's honour.

960
01:28:32,571 --> 01:28:35,771
And you by disrespecting women..

961
01:28:35,971 --> 01:28:37,891
..call yourself the devotee
of Bajrang Bali.

962
01:28:38,889 --> 01:28:42,450
You are not a wrestler, but
the pet dog of Raja sir.

963
01:29:29,562 --> 01:29:31,042
Did you see, Raja sir?

964
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:33,827
How a curse of a poor person..

965
01:29:34,482 --> 01:29:36,882
..showers like thousands of sticks.

966
01:29:38,171 --> 01:29:39,809
What condition they are in today..

967
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:42,851
..the way their bones
have been broken..

968
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:46,090
..tomorrow in a similar manner..

969
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,891
..your pride will also
break down, Ranbir.

970
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:52,538
Their love, like an uproar is
colliding with your palace.

971
01:29:53,114 --> 01:29:54,914
Your foundations are shaking.

972
01:29:55,275 --> 01:29:56,835
Today if the foundations
are shaking..

973
01:29:57,051 --> 01:29:58,571
..then tomorrow the walls
will also fall down.

974
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:01,827
You people can't close this
uproar in your fists.

975
01:30:02,302 --> 01:30:04,891
You can't stop the craziness
of their love.

976
01:30:04,971 --> 01:30:09,016
You can't stop! You can't stop!

977
01:31:02,691 --> 01:31:08,331
"I became crazy, my beloved,
in your love."

978
01:31:08,554 --> 01:31:13,754
"I have to strike this world,
my beloved, in your love."

979
01:31:14,444 --> 01:31:20,044
"I became mad, crazy, your
beloved, your queen."

980
01:31:20,235 --> 01:31:23,155
"Ajay is only mine."

981
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:28,893
"I became crazy, my beloved,
in your love."

982
01:31:29,051 --> 01:31:34,771
"I have to strike this world,
my beloved, in your love."

983
01:31:34,851 --> 01:31:40,770
"I became mad, crazy, your
beloved, your queen."

984
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:43,691
"Ajay is only mine."

985
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:49,411
"I became crazy, my beloved,
in your love."

986
01:31:49,611 --> 01:31:55,651
"I have to strike this world,
my beloved, in your love."

987
01:32:24,948 --> 01:32:30,668
"The tempest of love never stops."

988
01:32:30,891 --> 01:32:36,691
"The whole world bows
in front of true love."

989
01:32:36,732 --> 01:32:42,252
"My life is now the keepsake
of your love."

990
01:32:42,611 --> 01:32:48,313
"I'll love you forever,
be it dawn or dusk."

991
01:32:51,211 --> 01:32:54,105
"I have to stoop my
heart to your feet.."

992
01:32:54,146 --> 01:32:56,866
"..my beloved, in your love."

993
01:32:57,091 --> 01:33:02,651
"I have to do so many things,
my beloved, in your love."

994
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:08,810
"I became mad, crazy, your
beloved, your queen."

995
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:11,851
"Ajay is only mine."

996
01:33:11,892 --> 01:33:17,292
"I became crazy, my beloved,
in your love."

997
01:33:17,571 --> 01:33:23,531
"I have to strike this world,
my beloved, in your love."

998
01:34:10,532 --> 01:34:16,212
"We have to cross all the
limits of the world."

999
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:22,290
"I want to live and
die in your arms."

1000
01:34:22,331 --> 01:34:27,811
"How do I tell you this craziness?"

1001
01:34:28,216 --> 01:34:33,856
"The magic of your loyalty,
my beloved is affecting me."

1002
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:42,091
"I have to make the lips meet,
my beloved, in your love."

1003
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:48,171
"I have to expend everything,
my beloved, in your love."

1004
01:34:48,578 --> 01:34:54,377
"You became mad, crazy,
my beloved, my queen."

1005
01:34:54,465 --> 01:34:58,305
"Ajay is only yours."

1006
01:35:00,162 --> 01:35:05,562
"I became crazy, my beloved,
in your love."

1007
01:35:06,051 --> 01:35:11,611
"I became crazy, my beloved,
in your love."

1008
01:35:23,929 --> 01:35:26,849
So now it's decided that
the girl's uncle..

1009
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,490
..on the happy occasion
of his niece's wedding..

1010
01:35:29,531 --> 01:35:33,610
..will give to the boy
for the engagement..

1011
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:36,251
..an amount of Rs. 11,11,111.11/-

1012
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:38,490
Then my Rupaiya will be yours..

1013
01:35:38,562 --> 01:35:41,202
..and your Laxmi mine.

1014
01:35:41,891 --> 01:35:43,810
Now call the girl's mother..

1015
01:35:43,851 --> 01:35:46,891
..and give the boy 111
rupees as a sweet.

1016
01:35:50,691 --> 01:35:51,455
Sonu!

1017
01:35:58,611 --> 01:36:03,531
Lajjo!
- Sonu! - Lajwanti! - Son Chand.

1018
01:36:06,682 --> 01:36:08,322
Son Chand, you and here.

1019
01:36:08,515 --> 01:36:11,875
Yes, I'm fixing my son's
marriage with Laxmi.

1020
01:36:12,146 --> 01:36:17,146
O my God!
- What happened? - Yes!

1021
01:36:18,596 --> 01:36:20,770
No! This marriage can't happen!

1022
01:36:20,811 --> 01:36:22,050
Now when everything
has been decided..

1023
01:36:22,091 --> 01:36:23,131
..then why can't this
marriage take place?

1024
01:36:23,172 --> 01:36:26,412
This marriage can't take place.
- But, why, father?

1025
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,081
Because she's your sister.

1026
01:36:29,403 --> 01:36:34,363
It means..
- Yes. - Father!

1027
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:47,337
Greetings, Raja sir.
- Why did you come here?

1028
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:50,451
To give the invitation of
my daughter's wedding.

1029
01:36:51,611 --> 01:36:53,371
You've come to give the invitation..

1030
01:36:53,971 --> 01:36:55,571
..or to form a relation with us.

1031
01:36:56,650 --> 01:37:00,531
You've found such an easy way of..

1032
01:37:01,408 --> 01:37:04,328
..travelling from your
hut to this palace.

1033
01:37:05,907 --> 01:37:07,707
You forgot your status?

1034
01:37:08,051 --> 01:37:12,251
Poor people don't have status,
but only emotions.

1035
01:37:12,451 --> 01:37:15,610
In the drama of this emotion
you've play a good trick..

1036
01:37:15,651 --> 01:37:17,971
..of trapping my innocent niece.

1037
01:37:18,971 --> 01:37:22,651
I didn't know that poor
people are so cunning.

1038
01:37:23,491 --> 01:37:27,251
This is not an invitation..
but your conspiracy.

1039
01:37:28,087 --> 01:37:31,771
And this is my answer for it.

1040
01:37:41,842 --> 01:37:43,362
The stones of this palace has..

1041
01:37:43,403 --> 01:37:45,203
..still not learned to
respect invitations.

1042
01:37:47,091 --> 01:37:50,171
You shouldn't have come
to invite such people.

1043
01:37:51,171 --> 01:37:52,571
Who don't have the manners to talk..

1044
01:37:52,612 --> 01:37:53,892
..with their daughter's
mother-in-law.

1045
01:37:55,273 --> 01:37:58,153
I apologize on his behalf.
- No, my dear, no.

1046
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:03,570
Actually he wants to give
the proof of his bravery..

1047
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:06,011
..by taking out his anger
of defeat on this paper.

1048
01:38:06,938 --> 01:38:10,818
But unfortunately, this paper
can be torn into two pieces.

1049
01:38:11,931 --> 01:38:13,651
But not my love.

1050
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:20,609
Thank you, Raja sir.

1051
01:38:21,778 --> 01:38:25,138
lf this slap had been a lesson
for a lost daughter given..

1052
01:38:25,179 --> 01:38:28,659
..by a kind father, then I would
have happily accepted it.

1053
01:38:29,796 --> 01:38:33,316
But this slap is a challenge
to my love..

1054
01:38:33,357 --> 01:38:37,259
..given by an egoistic person
blinded by power.

1055
01:38:38,196 --> 01:38:40,316
And I accept this challenge.

1056
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:46,691
Mother, you go home and
tell Anjali that..

1057
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:49,771
..not only will her to be
sister-in-law come..

1058
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:52,131
..but she'll also sing and dance.

1059
01:38:54,171 --> 01:38:57,091
And if someone can stop,
then try to stop me.

1060
01:39:16,858 --> 01:39:21,818
"By tinkling fickle bangles. By
applying henna on the hand."

1061
01:39:21,891 --> 01:39:27,048
"By tinkling fickle bangles. By
applying henna on the hand."

1062
01:39:27,089 --> 01:39:29,509
"By putting an ornament
on the forehead."

1063
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:32,250
"By casting a veil of shame."

1064
01:39:32,291 --> 01:39:36,931
"Leaving your parent's house."

1065
01:39:37,091 --> 01:39:41,971
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1066
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:47,011
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1067
01:39:47,052 --> 01:39:52,092
"By tinkling fickle bangles. By
applying henna on the hand."

1068
01:39:52,133 --> 01:39:54,653
"By putting an ornament
on the forehead."

1069
01:39:54,694 --> 01:39:57,134
"By casting a veil of shame."

1070
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:02,211
"Leaving your parent's house."

1071
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:07,287
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1072
01:40:07,328 --> 01:40:13,088
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1073
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:22,939
"Bring, my friends, the
dress of the bride."

1074
01:40:23,266 --> 01:40:28,170
"We'll lovingly deck up the bride."

1075
01:40:28,211 --> 01:40:33,131
"Applying the paste of
turmeric on the legs."

1076
01:40:33,258 --> 01:40:38,178
"We'll make your face
shimmer ornaments."

1077
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:42,891
"He'll be fervent with
your flower like body."

1078
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:47,660
"The bridegroom will be
dazed when he sees you."

1079
01:40:47,904 --> 01:40:50,624
"By shimmering the bindi
of moonlight."

1080
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:52,970
"By the fragrance of the
flower in your hair."

1081
01:40:53,011 --> 01:40:55,571
"By putting an ornament
on the forehead."

1082
01:40:55,651 --> 01:40:58,091
"By casting a veil of shame."

1083
01:40:58,491 --> 01:41:03,091
"Leaving your parent's house."

1084
01:41:03,211 --> 01:41:07,611
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1085
01:41:08,126 --> 01:41:14,091
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1086
01:41:29,218 --> 01:41:34,178
"The foreign bird, every sister."

1087
01:41:34,251 --> 01:41:38,891
"No one has to live here forever."

1088
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:44,211
"To endure every pain
like the earth."

1089
01:41:44,379 --> 01:41:49,019
"Don't say anything to anyone."

1090
01:41:49,476 --> 01:41:53,876
"You have to live and die in
the shadow of your husband."

1091
01:41:53,917 --> 01:41:58,850
"Never make the head of
your parents bow down."

1092
01:41:58,891 --> 01:42:01,571
"By hiding dreams in your eyes."

1093
01:42:01,612 --> 01:42:04,092
"By stealing your husband's heart."

1094
01:42:04,133 --> 01:42:06,373
"By putting an ornament
on the forehead."

1095
01:42:06,507 --> 01:42:09,187
"By casting a veil of shame."

1096
01:42:09,451 --> 01:42:13,971
"Leaving your parent's house."

1097
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:19,011
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1098
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:24,611
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1099
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:56,970
"The guy is coming
riding on a horse."

1100
01:42:57,011 --> 01:43:03,411
"The guy is coming
riding on a horse."

1101
01:43:03,938 --> 01:43:08,018
"The guy glances from
behind the veil."

1102
01:43:08,137 --> 01:43:10,857
"The guy glances from
behind the veil."

1103
01:43:12,363 --> 01:43:16,570
"The guy glances from
behind the veil."

1104
01:43:16,611 --> 01:43:21,411
"I changed her after
chewing tobacco.."

1105
01:43:22,411 --> 01:43:28,611
"The guy is coming
riding on a horse."

1106
01:43:28,724 --> 01:43:35,284
"The guy is coming
riding on a horse."

1107
01:43:35,597 --> 01:43:39,890
"The guy's father is
greedy for money."

1108
01:43:39,931 --> 01:43:44,051
"The guy's father...
- Yes, father."

1109
01:43:44,131 --> 01:43:48,371
"The guy's father is
greedy for money."

1110
01:43:48,451 --> 01:43:52,771
"The guy will die
as a bachelor."

1111
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:57,890
"My son is a pickpocket."

1112
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:00,451
"I am delighted.."

1113
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:03,810
"My son is a pickpocket."

1114
01:44:04,011 --> 01:44:06,731
"I am delighted.."

1115
01:44:06,928 --> 01:44:14,248
"The guy is coming
riding on a horse."

1116
01:44:14,731 --> 01:44:16,051
The aroma is good.

1117
01:44:16,587 --> 01:44:17,747
The marriage procession
will be about to come.

1118
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:19,771
Other arrangements are done?
- Yes, sir.

1119
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:24,210
The sweet's aroma is good.

1120
01:44:24,251 --> 01:44:26,091
Ajay brother, Ajay brother,
the procession has come.

1121
01:44:26,331 --> 01:44:26,813
The procession has come!

1122
01:44:41,683 --> 01:44:42,593
Greetings.

1123
01:44:47,682 --> 01:44:48,731
My blessings, son.

1124
01:45:32,291 --> 01:45:38,531
"God, my God, why did you write?"

1125
01:45:38,851 --> 01:45:44,331
"The separation of a daughter,
in my fate."

1126
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:51,291
"No one can stop a daughter."

1127
01:45:51,491 --> 01:45:57,171
"Even if she is secured
with chains."

1128
01:45:57,851 --> 01:46:03,291
"Why the time of separation
has to come?"

1129
01:46:03,578 --> 01:46:09,578
"We can't stop this flow of tears."

1130
01:46:09,755 --> 01:46:13,155
"By forgetting the mother's love."

1131
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:16,283
"By making brother and
sister-in-law cry."

1132
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:19,611
"By going away from friends."

1133
01:46:19,698 --> 01:46:22,818
"By shedding tears."

1134
01:46:22,891 --> 01:46:28,891
"Leaving your parent's house."

1135
01:46:29,331 --> 01:46:35,171
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1136
01:46:35,731 --> 01:46:41,811
"You'll have to go,
you'll have to go."

1137
01:47:16,598 --> 01:47:18,610
Small master, where
are you all going?

1138
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:22,048
I'll ablaze them. I'll
destroy that rascal.

1139
01:47:22,089 --> 01:47:24,329
You don't need to do all this.

1140
01:47:24,499 --> 01:47:26,673
Your niece has already
done all this.

1141
01:47:26,977 --> 01:47:29,777
By hanging that Ajay.
- What do you mean?

1142
01:47:47,731 --> 01:47:48,851
Police!

1143
01:47:50,168 --> 01:47:52,451
What is happening? Why are
you all going inside?

1144
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:54,250
What is happening?

1145
01:47:54,291 --> 01:47:56,211
Hey, you old man, can't you see?

1146
01:47:57,050 --> 01:48:02,850
We're searching your house.
- But, why inspector sir?

1147
01:48:02,891 --> 01:48:04,691
Because we've got the information.

1148
01:48:05,064 --> 01:48:06,531
The things that has come from..

1149
01:48:06,572 --> 01:48:09,132
..your son's in-law's place..
is stolen goods.

1150
01:48:09,531 --> 01:48:13,411
Stolen! No, inspector sir.
What are you saying?

1151
01:48:13,811 --> 01:48:16,051
My son's in-laws are very decent
and respected people.

1152
01:48:16,131 --> 01:48:18,171
Decency has vanished.

1153
01:48:18,754 --> 01:48:23,114
As to respect, it doesn't
take time to uncover it.

1154
01:48:23,217 --> 01:48:24,577
Stop, inspector sir.

1155
01:48:26,771 --> 01:48:30,691
Inspector sir, we'll be insulted
in front of the community.

1156
01:48:31,016 --> 01:48:33,402
That is true.
- And everyone is gathered here.

1157
01:48:34,627 --> 01:48:35,667
Avinash and daughter-in-law
has gone..

1158
01:48:35,892 --> 01:48:37,332
..to the temple with their brother.

1159
01:48:37,841 --> 01:48:40,081
Let them come. They'll
be about to come.

1160
01:48:40,531 --> 01:48:42,931
Are you stopping us
from doing our work?

1161
01:48:43,570 --> 01:48:47,210
I can put you behind the bars for..

1162
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:49,211
..trying to stop government work.

1163
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,120
You and your wife both, understood.

1164
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:09,170
Father, police is here!
What is happening?

1165
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:14,011
Dear, policemen are saying that
the goods that has come..

1166
01:49:14,315 --> 01:49:15,795
..from daughter-in-law's house
includes stolen goods.

1167
01:49:29,051 --> 01:49:35,011
Inspector, sir. You are mistaken.
Stop this search.

1168
01:49:37,331 --> 01:49:38,971
Who are you?
- Ajay.

1169
01:49:39,442 --> 01:49:45,402
Ajay! You look so innocent.

1170
01:49:45,891 --> 01:49:47,411
You're accumulating wealth
as an innocent person.

1171
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:50,890
There is no robber in
this locality who..

1172
01:49:50,931 --> 01:49:53,331
..hasn't been beaten by Tipar Singh.

1173
01:49:54,353 --> 01:49:56,873
How did you escape?
- What are you saying?

1174
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:01,131
Look, inspector, sir.
You've got some wrong information.

1175
01:50:01,942 --> 01:50:05,095
There are no stolen goods here.
You stop this search.

1176
01:50:05,691 --> 01:50:07,011
This is my sister's in-laws' house.

1177
01:50:08,362 --> 01:50:09,842
It's a shameful thing for us.

1178
01:50:10,651 --> 01:50:12,211
I'll come to the police
station with you.

1179
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:15,730
You stop this drama!
And go and stand over there!

1180
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:19,218
Leave it, son. It's futile to argue.

1181
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:21,530
Inspector sir, you
continue your work.

1182
01:50:21,571 --> 01:50:23,811
That is what I'm doing.
If this person lets me do it.

1183
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:27,131
Go! Did you find anything?

1184
01:50:27,266 --> 01:50:29,026
Sir, we didn't find anything
amongst the big ones.

1185
01:50:34,297 --> 01:50:36,657
Have you completed your search?
Are you satisfied?

1186
01:50:37,787 --> 01:50:40,987
Father, we're not thieves.

1187
01:50:42,051 --> 01:50:47,171
No matter how bad a brother is,
he'll never insult his sister.

1188
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:48,771
Yes, dear.

1189
01:50:49,011 --> 01:50:51,331
And before we sue you
for defamation..

1190
01:50:51,372 --> 01:50:52,532
..go away from here.

1191
01:51:00,531 --> 01:51:03,571
Who gave you this jewellery?
- My brother.

1192
01:51:04,131 --> 01:51:06,811
Then this necklace too your
brother must have given you.

1193
01:51:07,505 --> 01:51:10,425
No, this necklace Rama sister
gave me as a gift.

1194
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:15,051
Rama sister has given as a gift.

1195
01:51:17,611 --> 01:51:19,011
What are you saying, girl?

1196
01:51:19,451 --> 01:51:23,011
Rama sister gave you a 5 lakhs
worth necklace as a gift.

1197
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:26,971
Did you all see it?
Did your eyeballs pop out?

1198
01:51:27,961 --> 01:51:30,321
Have medicine of senses. Just think.

1199
01:51:31,714 --> 01:51:35,314
This necklace King Brjiwas
Singh gave to his niece.

1200
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:38,745
Will Raja sir's niece
give the necklace..

1201
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:41,043
..to this person's sister
just like that.

1202
01:51:43,051 --> 01:51:44,731
Did you see the decency
of civilized people?

1203
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:48,971
This necklace is actually stolen.

1204
01:51:49,289 --> 01:51:51,449
This is a lie.
- No, this is the truth.

1205
01:51:51,931 --> 01:51:55,010
Believe me, father, Rama sister
gave me this necklace.

1206
01:51:55,051 --> 01:51:58,291
Really! This necklace your
Rama sister gave you!

1207
01:51:59,065 --> 01:52:00,345
Maybe she forgot about it.

1208
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:02,922
Because your Rama sister has filed..

1209
01:52:02,971 --> 01:52:05,931
..a complaint of robbery
in the police station.

1210
01:52:06,451 --> 01:52:08,571
And she even named the
thief in the report.

1211
01:52:08,612 --> 01:52:11,972
Read it.
- Ajay!

1212
01:52:12,664 --> 01:52:15,184
This is a lie. My brother
didn't steal it.

1213
01:52:15,691 --> 01:52:17,450
He doesn't even know anything
about the necklace.

1214
01:52:17,642 --> 01:52:19,850
Believe me, father. My brother..

1215
01:52:19,891 --> 01:52:21,011
Sister's snitch.

1216
01:52:22,273 --> 01:52:25,497
lf you wanted to throw your
sister from the house..

1217
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:28,090
..then what was the need to steal?

1218
01:52:29,602 --> 01:52:31,162
You should have sold
her to a brothel.

1219
01:52:32,794 --> 01:52:33,754
Arrest him!

1220
01:52:34,357 --> 01:52:38,477
Brother! Brother, no! No,
brother! Stop! Stop!

1221
01:52:38,764 --> 01:52:39,684
Brother, stop.

1222
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:58,450
Do you know the consequences..

1223
01:52:58,491 --> 01:53:00,851
..of hitting a decent
police officer?

1224
01:53:03,786 --> 01:53:09,782
I'll change the map
of your future. Come!

1225
01:53:15,531 --> 01:53:22,851
Move! Put this thief inside.

1226
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:35,970
Avinash's father,
I'll not let this unlucky..

1227
01:53:36,011 --> 01:53:37,051
..person stay in this house.

1228
01:53:38,976 --> 01:53:42,216
This is a lie.
You're wrongly accusing Ajay.

1229
01:53:42,611 --> 01:53:44,730
I'd myself given the necklace
to Anjali, uncle.

1230
01:53:44,771 --> 01:53:48,010
Ajay is innocent.
I won't keep quiet.

1231
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:51,130
I'll scream and uncover your ruses.

1232
01:53:56,545 --> 01:53:57,585
Where are you going?

1233
01:54:18,851 --> 01:54:22,691
Mother, mother.

1234
01:54:23,610 --> 01:54:27,730
Your testimony in the court
can kill this old lady.

1235
01:54:28,459 --> 01:54:33,379
Or if you listen to us, then the
old lady's life will be spared.

1236
01:54:33,977 --> 01:54:36,857
You're beast, not human being.

1237
01:54:36,971 --> 01:54:38,131
You're right.

1238
01:54:39,316 --> 01:54:41,789
You took advantage of our love..

1239
01:54:42,561 --> 01:54:48,081
..and the way you've insulted us,
we'll never tolerate it.

1240
01:54:48,851 --> 01:54:50,731
Till now you've seen our love, Rama.

1241
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:53,291
Now you'll see our hatred.

1242
01:54:57,331 --> 01:55:00,571
Don't be so ruthlessness.
Forgive Ajay.

1243
01:55:01,051 --> 01:55:04,131
Spare Ajay, spare Ajay, spare Ajay

1244
01:55:04,172 --> 01:55:06,252
We'll spare Ajay.

1245
01:55:06,556 --> 01:55:12,356
But only when you testify
against him in the court.

1246
01:55:14,819 --> 01:55:17,579
I'm being accused wrongly,
judge. I didn't steal.

1247
01:55:18,851 --> 01:55:19,491
This necklace Rama only had given..

1248
01:55:19,532 --> 01:55:22,103
..to my sister as a wedding gift.

1249
01:55:22,331 --> 01:55:24,211
This is a conspiracy of my enemies.

1250
01:55:24,851 --> 01:55:27,091
They must have faked
Rama's signature.

1251
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:32,931
You call Rama. She'll uncover
their lie in a flash.

1252
01:55:36,251 --> 01:55:40,851
Call Manorama madam.
- Manorama madam may come.

1253
01:55:41,571 --> 01:55:44,251
Manorama madam may come.

1254
01:55:53,771 --> 01:55:56,091
Manorama madam, is this
necklace yours?

1255
01:55:56,651 --> 01:55:58,091
The accused says that you'd
gifted this necklace..

1256
01:55:58,132 --> 01:56:00,292
..to the accuser's sister
for her wedding.

1257
01:56:00,819 --> 01:56:04,059
Is this true? Tell, Manorama
madam. Answer me.

1258
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:08,211
Why are you silent? I'm asking
you. Why don't you answer?

1259
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:11,419
Manorama madam, the court
wants to know. Tell us.

1260
01:56:12,731 --> 01:56:14,851
Did you file a report
for this necklace?

1261
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:17,370
Is this the same report? Are
these your signatures?

1262
01:56:18,011 --> 01:56:20,251
Answer me. Tell the
truth to the court.

1263
01:56:20,747 --> 01:56:21,867
Why don't you say something?

1264
01:56:22,682 --> 01:56:24,202
What are you thinking,
Manorama madam?

1265
01:56:24,371 --> 01:56:26,691
Answer me. Are these
your signature?

1266
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:29,660
Yes, these are my signatures.

1267
01:56:29,811 --> 01:56:31,811
Rama, are you in your right mind?

1268
01:56:33,955 --> 01:56:36,195
For the first time in my
life I'm fully conscious.

1269
01:56:37,307 --> 01:56:39,667
For the first time I saw
the real face of love.

1270
01:56:40,597 --> 01:56:42,677
And I also saw the dangerous
intentions..

1271
01:56:42,718 --> 01:56:44,758
..hidden behind his sweet talks.

1272
01:56:46,371 --> 01:56:48,851
For the first time I realised that..

1273
01:56:50,027 --> 01:56:51,867
..love could be such a big ruse.

1274
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:54,010
Rama, do you know
what you're saying?

1275
01:56:55,074 --> 01:56:57,594
Judge, she's being pressurized.

1276
01:56:57,651 --> 01:56:59,811
When I didn't care for
anyone's pressure..

1277
01:56:59,852 --> 01:57:00,932
..when I'd loved you.

1278
01:57:01,411 --> 01:57:03,011
Then why would I care
for anyone's pressure..

1279
01:57:03,052 --> 01:57:04,572
..now while testifying in the court?

1280
01:57:06,131 --> 01:57:07,731
My love was my will.

1281
01:57:08,953 --> 01:57:11,001
I'm giving this testimony
also on my own will.

1282
01:57:12,251 --> 01:57:15,771
Ajay, I didn't expect this from you.

1283
01:57:16,339 --> 01:57:18,699
That you love my wealth
more than me.

1284
01:57:20,019 --> 01:57:24,299
I'd forgotten that when
a poor person like you..

1285
01:57:24,433 --> 01:57:29,713
..loves a rich girl like me,
then it's only a drama.

1286
01:57:31,027 --> 01:57:33,667
To accumulate dowry for
your sister's wedding.

1287
01:57:33,794 --> 01:57:36,834
Betrayer! At last you showed
your true nature.

1288
01:57:37,266 --> 01:57:39,386
Order! Order! Arrest him!

1289
01:57:39,651 --> 01:57:44,211
You talk about rich and poor!
You've played with our lives!

1290
01:57:44,634 --> 01:57:46,182
I'll kill you, you cheat!

1291
01:58:30,051 --> 01:58:34,091
Uncle.. what you said.. I did it.

1292
01:58:35,251 --> 01:58:37,691
I've maligned my image
in front of Ajay.

1293
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:43,850
He'll never forgive me.
I killed my own love.

1294
01:58:44,491 --> 01:58:46,051
I lost everything that was mine.

1295
01:58:46,604 --> 01:58:48,044
At least now release mother.

1296
01:58:50,649 --> 01:58:55,849
Ranbir.. release the old lady.

1297
01:59:07,091 --> 01:59:11,251
Mother! Mother!

1298
01:59:15,324 --> 01:59:20,644
Mother! What did you do!

1299
01:59:31,882 --> 01:59:33,162
Poor Laxmi.

1300
01:59:33,491 --> 01:59:35,451
May God never give a fate
like hers to anyone.

1301
01:59:35,811 --> 01:59:37,891
Just recently her daughter
had got married.

1302
01:59:38,131 --> 01:59:39,771
And now she has committed suicide.

1303
01:59:39,939 --> 01:59:42,204
God knows what agony
had befallen her.

1304
01:59:42,245 --> 01:59:43,690
lf it were an agony, she
would have endured it.

1305
01:59:43,731 --> 01:59:46,091
But she had to go through
something worst than agony.

1306
01:59:46,546 --> 01:59:47,786
Son turned out to be a crook.

1307
01:59:48,106 --> 01:59:49,906
Daughter has a bad name
at her in-laws' place.

1308
01:59:51,113 --> 01:59:54,273
Which mother can endure all this?

1309
01:59:54,851 --> 01:59:57,251
The one whom she gave birth to,
nurtured and raised up..

1310
01:59:57,411 --> 01:59:59,131
..that person only disrepute
her and went away.

1311
02:00:00,803 --> 02:00:04,210
Poor woman must have gone
to God hiding her face.

1312
02:00:04,251 --> 02:00:07,971
Strange! To which scoundrel
she gave birth?

1313
02:00:08,971 --> 02:00:11,011
They say that mother of a crook..

1314
02:00:11,091 --> 02:00:13,171
..hides her face in the black room.

1315
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:17,300
After giving birth to
such a spoilt brat..

1316
02:00:17,675 --> 02:00:19,155
..how would she had hidden her face.

1317
02:00:19,691 --> 02:00:22,411
She had to commit suicide.
She had no other option.

1318
02:00:40,771 --> 02:00:43,331
However she was.. she was
from our locality only.

1319
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:49,051
I'm remorseful that her child
didn't let her live.

1320
02:00:50,091 --> 02:00:52,851
But it's our duty to
respect her death.

1321
02:00:53,891 --> 02:00:57,564
I take the responsibility
of her funeral.

1322
02:00:57,931 --> 02:00:59,111
Lala.
- Yes.

1323
02:00:59,291 --> 02:01:00,611
See to it that there is..

1324
02:01:00,667 --> 02:01:01,827
..no negligence in the arrangement.

1325
02:01:01,868 --> 02:01:02,948
Understood.
- Yes.

1326
02:01:11,091 --> 02:01:11,691
Stop.

1327
02:01:33,971 --> 02:01:37,651
Foolish woman! You
wanted to curse me.

1328
02:01:38,171 --> 02:01:41,011
But you forgot that a widow
never gives a curse.

1329
02:01:41,771 --> 02:01:44,331
You only had said that
I won't be able..

1330
02:01:44,372 --> 02:01:46,332
..to stop the flow of
Love of those two.

1331
02:01:47,371 --> 02:01:51,851
I not only stopped it, but
also mixed such a poison..

1332
02:01:52,291 --> 02:01:55,851
..that if one cries
the tear of blood..

1333
02:01:56,331 --> 02:01:59,451
..then from the other's eyes
fire of hatred will flow.

1334
02:02:31,651 --> 02:02:33,291
Sign on this paper.

1335
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:37,011
What are you staring at?

1336
02:02:37,691 --> 02:02:39,811
I'm not taking away your
inheritance from you.

1337
02:02:41,131 --> 02:02:44,691
This is the government paper
for your mother's funeral.

1338
02:02:45,154 --> 02:02:47,034
In which your signature is required.

1339
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:50,250
We can't count on you.

1340
02:02:51,251 --> 02:02:54,571
Tomorrow you might say that
your mother didn't..

1341
02:02:54,889 --> 02:02:57,129
..commit suicide, but someone
had murdered her.

1342
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:59,251
And you might falsely
accuse the police..

1343
02:02:59,292 --> 02:03:00,412
..for not carrying out
the investigations.

1344
02:03:01,251 --> 02:03:05,331
Your sister is very intelligent.
She has signed.

1345
02:03:05,372 --> 02:03:06,292
Now you too sign on it.

1346
02:03:06,651 --> 02:03:07,651
Come on, do it.

1347
02:03:21,691 --> 02:03:24,051
lf some other criminal had
been in your place..

1348
02:03:25,137 --> 02:03:28,617
..then I would have permitted
him to attend the final rites.

1349
02:03:30,156 --> 02:03:34,316
But you.. I won't permit you to go.

1350
02:03:35,339 --> 02:03:38,610
Because you had beaten Tipar Singh.

1351
02:03:38,651 --> 02:03:40,651
I'll never let you forget this.

1352
02:03:52,851 --> 02:03:54,771
Shoot me!
- No! No!

1353
02:04:24,099 --> 02:04:25,139
Brother.

1354
02:06:18,491 --> 02:06:21,451
Ajay! Ajay!

1355
02:06:23,051 --> 02:06:24,971
You don't know what these people..

1356
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:28,000
At least hear me out.

1357
02:06:28,041 --> 02:06:28,842
Shut up!

1358
02:06:30,691 --> 02:06:33,491
I've paid the price for
every lie that you spoke.

1359
02:06:35,051 --> 02:06:37,771
Your this lie killed my mother..

1360
02:06:38,011 --> 02:06:41,051
..my sister got disowned from
her in-laws' house. - No.

1361
02:06:43,211 --> 02:06:45,611
Your lie ruined my life.

1362
02:06:47,251 --> 02:06:48,891
Today I won't spare you.

1363
02:06:48,932 --> 02:06:49,932
Stop, brother, stop.

1364
02:06:49,973 --> 02:06:51,413
I won't spare you. Leave me.

1365
02:06:51,454 --> 02:06:53,374
I say stop, stop.

1366
02:06:54,291 --> 02:06:56,491
You want to kill her. Go ahead.

1367
02:06:57,051 --> 02:06:58,651
But you have to pay the
price of her death..

1368
02:06:58,692 --> 02:07:00,412
..by your sister's death.

1369
02:07:00,531 --> 02:07:02,131
Anjali, she's the murderer
of our mother.

1370
02:07:02,941 --> 02:07:05,101
Her false testimony
ruined our lives.

1371
02:07:05,276 --> 02:07:06,916
This is what I want to understand.

1372
02:07:07,219 --> 02:07:09,339
That why did she give a false
testimony in the court.

1373
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:11,051
Get up.

1374
02:07:16,251 --> 02:07:18,651
There is some truth
hidden in her tears..

1375
02:07:18,731 --> 02:07:20,131
..that she's not able to say.

1376
02:07:20,211 --> 02:07:21,691
Her tears are just a hoodwink.

1377
02:07:22,291 --> 02:07:23,731
Just like how her love
was only hoodwink.

1378
02:07:24,531 --> 02:07:26,251
Only a woman can understand
the value..

1379
02:07:26,331 --> 02:07:28,171
..of another woman's tears, brother.

1380
02:07:30,531 --> 02:07:32,571
Right now you're blinded
by your revenge.

1381
02:07:33,291 --> 02:07:36,011
But when your eyes will
open, on that day..

1382
02:07:36,052 --> 02:07:38,172
..you'll realize the injustice
that you've done.

1383
02:07:38,571 --> 02:07:41,451
Come on, sister-in-law.
Come on, come on.

1384
02:07:43,165 --> 02:07:44,251
Where are you taking her?

1385
02:07:45,051 --> 02:07:46,171
To the same house where mother..

1386
02:07:46,212 --> 02:07:47,652
..had accepted her as
a daughter-in-law.

1387
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:23,330
Brother! Brother! Rama is not here.

1388
02:08:23,371 --> 02:08:27,211
I know. That rascal
abducted our Rama.

1389
02:08:27,579 --> 02:08:29,059
Even after knowing all this,
you're silent.

1390
02:08:29,759 --> 02:08:31,290
Tomorrow when the people
will come to know..

1391
02:08:31,331 --> 02:08:33,171
..about this thing, then our
reputation will be ruined.

1392
02:08:33,731 --> 02:08:35,462
We will not even be able to
show our face to anybody.

1393
02:08:35,531 --> 02:08:38,371
Ranbir, I'll never let
that moment come.

1394
02:08:38,691 --> 02:08:40,051
That moment has come.

1395
02:08:40,092 --> 02:08:41,210
That moment has come.

1396
02:08:41,251 --> 02:08:42,331
That moment has come.

1397
02:08:42,372 --> 02:08:45,892
That moment has come.
That moment has come.

1398
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:50,410
That moment has come, Brijrai.

1399
02:08:59,411 --> 02:09:02,411
You had said that a widow
never gives a curse.

1400
02:09:03,971 --> 02:09:06,571
Then listen, no woman
becomes a widow..

1401
02:09:07,028 --> 02:09:08,908
..on her own free will.

1402
02:09:10,682 --> 02:09:12,996
Rascal impotent men like you are..

1403
02:09:13,651 --> 02:09:16,090
..responsible for giving
her this status.

1404
02:09:16,131 --> 02:09:17,731
As for my curse.

1405
02:09:18,291 --> 02:09:21,251
Very soon it is going to be
fulfilled in front of you.

1406
02:09:23,171 --> 02:09:26,971
Ranbir, you have great
pride in your power.

1407
02:09:28,082 --> 02:09:32,802
Try your best. But
remember one thing.

1408
02:09:34,051 --> 02:09:36,168
You will not be able to
escape the destruction..

1409
02:09:36,209 --> 02:09:39,209
..of the curse given
by a helpless woman.

1410
02:09:39,817 --> 02:09:41,217
You will not be able to escape.

1411
02:10:05,745 --> 02:10:07,865
I will not come, uncle. Leave me.

1412
02:10:13,531 --> 02:10:15,091
Burn this hut into ashes.

1413
02:10:33,771 --> 02:10:35,171
Come on.

1414
02:10:43,171 --> 02:10:47,050
Stop! You can't take away
the respect of this house.

1415
02:10:47,091 --> 02:10:48,851
You will stop us?
- Yes.

1416
02:10:52,531 --> 02:10:54,650
Do you know the consequences
of stopping us?

1417
02:10:54,691 --> 02:10:56,876
Yes, death. I accept it.

1418
02:10:57,002 --> 02:11:00,442
But as long as I'm alive, you
can't take them from here.

1419
02:11:20,171 --> 02:11:23,411
Why, you scoundrel! You try
to stop Raja sir's path!

1420
02:11:24,851 --> 02:11:27,451
No! No! No!

1421
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,170
Junior master, junior
master, stop them.

1422
02:11:30,211 --> 02:11:31,010
Junior master, stop them.

1423
02:11:31,051 --> 02:11:34,931
No! He stops my path! Dog!

1424
02:11:36,491 --> 02:11:39,251
Senior master, I've always
been faithful to you.

1425
02:11:39,331 --> 02:11:42,211
My son is naive.
Stop them, stop them.

1426
02:11:42,291 --> 02:11:43,331
No, Lala.

1427
02:11:43,611 --> 02:11:46,571
When the smell of rebellion
comes from my own blood..

1428
02:11:46,963 --> 02:11:48,443
..then I never forgive that person.

1429
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:49,450
No, no.

1430
02:11:49,491 --> 02:11:51,491
And your blood did the same thing.

1431
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:57,251
Thrash this rascal so much, so
much.. that his last scream..

1432
02:11:57,777 --> 02:11:59,537
..reverberates on every
wall of this city.

1433
02:12:00,251 --> 02:12:03,691
So that after this day no one
dares to rebel against me.

1434
02:12:03,938 --> 02:12:10,138
No! No! No, Raja sir, no! No!
No! No! Raja sir! Raja sir!

1435
02:12:12,979 --> 02:12:15,337
No, father, no. Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

1436
02:12:15,378 --> 02:12:16,418
No, my son, no.

1437
02:12:17,548 --> 02:12:19,988
You must be delighted.

1438
02:12:20,491 --> 02:12:24,371
I've washed your sins with my blood.

1439
02:12:24,563 --> 02:12:25,443
No, my son, no.

1440
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:28,770
Your father won't be able to
live with this burden, son.

1441
02:12:29,722 --> 02:12:32,402
As it is, there are many burdens
of sins in my life.

1442
02:12:33,081 --> 02:12:35,201
I won't be able to endure
this burden, son.

1443
02:12:35,308 --> 02:12:36,681
I won't be able to endure it.

1444
02:12:38,476 --> 02:12:39,900
Father.
- Yes, my son.

1445
02:12:40,433 --> 02:12:42,513
Do you really want to atone
for your sins? - Yes.

1446
02:12:42,771 --> 02:12:45,691
Then go. Go and tell
the truth to Ajay.

1447
02:12:46,202 --> 02:12:49,082
Tell him that Rama is innocent.

1448
02:12:49,626 --> 02:12:51,906
Raja sir's men took her away.

1449
02:12:51,971 --> 02:12:53,011
You'll tell him, father, won't you?

1450
02:12:53,298 --> 02:12:57,098
Yes, yes, my son. Today
you've opened my eyes.

1451
02:12:58,090 --> 02:13:01,650
I'll never spare those sinners.

1452
02:13:02,456 --> 02:13:05,696
I'll unmask them in
front of the world.

1453
02:13:06,509 --> 02:13:08,509
Son, forgive me, my son.

1454
02:13:08,848 --> 02:13:10,648
It's good that they abducted her.

1455
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,840
She's my mother's murderer.

1456
02:13:11,928 --> 02:13:15,088
No. She's not your mother's murderer.

1457
02:13:16,217 --> 02:13:19,577
She even lied in the court
to save Laxmi sister.

1458
02:13:20,568 --> 02:13:22,030
And the truth is, Ajay..

1459
02:13:23,168 --> 02:13:25,128
..that your mother
didn't commit suicide.

1460
02:13:26,697 --> 02:13:28,937
She was murdered. Murdered.

1461
02:13:34,752 --> 02:13:36,872
'Go. I free you.'

1462
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:29,327
'No!'

1463
02:14:29,368 --> 02:14:31,748
'The voice that raises against us..

1464
02:14:32,128 --> 02:14:34,888
..gets suffocated in this manner#

1465
02:14:35,415 --> 02:14:39,935
'Call your son. Call him#

1466
02:14:40,368 --> 02:14:41,728
'Ajay!'

1467
02:14:46,937 --> 02:14:48,497
Rama is not the murderer, Ajay.

1468
02:14:48,888 --> 02:14:51,968
Save her, Ajay. Ajay, save her.

1469
02:15:04,168 --> 02:15:05,448
He'll come.

1470
02:15:06,351 --> 02:15:09,111
Today he'll himself walk and
come to the den of death.

1471
02:15:10,288 --> 02:15:11,488
No, uncle.

1472
02:15:33,768 --> 02:15:36,208
Greeting, Raja sir.
You all wait here only.

1473
02:15:36,288 --> 02:15:39,408
Raja sir, your Lala turned
out to be disloyal.

1474
02:15:39,488 --> 02:15:43,408
He went and told Ajay that
his mother was murdered.

1475
02:15:43,565 --> 02:15:45,005
His mother didn't commit suicide.

1476
02:15:45,575 --> 02:15:48,935
After hearing this news,
Ajay has become a wounded lion.

1477
02:15:49,567 --> 02:15:51,207
Now he'll straight away come..

1478
02:15:51,248 --> 02:15:54,648
Tipal Singh, there is
so much gunpowder..

1479
02:15:54,689 --> 02:15:55,649
..spread on all the sides
of this palace..

1480
02:15:56,527 --> 02:15:58,527
..that he won't be able to
go away alive from here.

1481
02:15:58,607 --> 02:16:01,047
No, uncle. I'll make Ajay understand.

1482
02:16:01,127 --> 02:16:02,487
I'll stop him. I'll handle him.

1483
02:16:02,528 --> 02:16:05,768
No! Only his death will stop
Ajay, understood! - No!

1484
02:16:05,887 --> 02:16:06,807
Take her away from here.

1485
02:16:06,848 --> 02:16:13,048
Don't kill Ajay! Don't kill Ajay!
Leave me, uncle! Leave me!

1486
02:16:13,128 --> 02:16:16,048
No! Leave me!

1487
02:16:16,328 --> 02:16:19,208
There is only one name
written on every gun..

1488
02:16:19,249 --> 02:16:26,129
..carried in this palace.
Ajay! Ajay! Ajay!

1489
02:17:48,351 --> 02:17:49,234
Ajay!

1490
02:18:20,832 --> 02:18:23,224
Ajay!
- Kill him!

1491
02:19:04,727 --> 02:19:06,287
You take her from here.
- Yes, Ajay.

1492
02:19:06,389 --> 02:19:10,429
Ajay, you.
- Go. - Ajay.

1493
02:20:15,736 --> 02:20:16,962
Drive fast, fast.
