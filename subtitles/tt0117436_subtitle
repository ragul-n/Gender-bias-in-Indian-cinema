1
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:49,296
There lies a story behind
every man who lies in his grave.

2
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:56,608
A story like this is etched in
blood and written by a sword.

3
00:01:57,382 --> 00:02:04,375
The story that lies under this 
grave is a story of love & hatred.

4
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:08,247
Aravalli and Thambor
were neighbouring kingdoms.

5
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:13,093
But a fire of hatred raged
between the two kingdoms.

6
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,943
It was a fire kindled by
the legendary beauty..

7
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:18,064
...of Queen Padmavati.

8
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,185
Padmavati rejected the 
advances of the King of Thambor.

9
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,132
And instead, she married
the King of Aravalli.

10
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:30,031
The King of Thambor 
was angered.

11
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,705
Prepare to attack Aravalli!

12
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:35,343
The King of Aravalli
had his son sent away ..

13
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,887
...from the heat of the war.

14
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:39,805
The young prince was
sent away to a hermitage.

15
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,083
Himmat, the nurse Panna's
son accompanied the prince.

16
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:49,367
The bloody war 
raged on for years.

17
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:52,806
One day, Queen Padmavati
picked up courage and..

18
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:55,287
...went over to the camps
of the King of Thambor ..

19
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,882
...on a peace mission.

20
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:02,694
The Queen of Aravalli?! 
Has she come?

21
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:10,410
Why does the Queen 
carry an unlit lamp?

22
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,256
Is there no light in Aravalli?

23
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:23,316
Can the fire of your 
angst light the lamp?

24
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:28,700
The King of Thambor was deeply
impressed by what Padmavati said.

25
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:34,013
The warring monarch
finally offered a truce.

26
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:43,937
How could you seek a truce with
the enemy without my permission?

27
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,310
I need not seek permission
to save my husband's life.

28
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:55,980
You insult me gravely.
I was sure to win this war.

29
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,552
I concede defeat, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,027
And what might be the reason
for the sudden change of heart?

31
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,983
I love my daughter, 
the Princess Vishakha.

32
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,602
The Queen has opened
my eyes by telling me that..

33
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:16,233
...the Prince of Aravalli is
living in exile in a hermitage.

34
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,526
How am I now to atone for my sin?

35
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:25,895
I seek with Aravalli, a relation
through matrimony; not enmity.

36
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,244
No!

37
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:36,180
Princess Vishakha's marriage
with the Prince of Aravalli!

38
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,335
That can be allowed 
under no circumstance!

39
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,335
King Rudra Pratap of Thambor
can't be allowed to dash..

40
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:47,626
...the hopes of his Grand
Vizier Durjan Singh as easily!

41
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,659
Why this sudden invitation?

42
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:53,414
My Grand Vizier was 
of the opinion that..

43
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:57,934
...you'd never come to
Thambor for signing a treaty.

44
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:01,472
What does your Grand
Vizier have to say now?

45
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:06,530
That the King of Thambor has done 
a grave insult to the thousands..

46
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:09,855
...of martyrs of Thambor by
entering into a treaty with you.

47
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,375
It was necessary to 
put an end to this war.

48
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:14,791
The war was indeed drawing
to an end, Your Majesty.

49
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:19,341
And the reason for our victory
had come to your camp herself.

50
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:22,657
Had you wanted, you could've
captured Queen Padmavati.

51
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:25,253
That would've put paid to
Aravalli once and forever.

52
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,839
But you chose to 
surrender the option.

53
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:31,760
And you have now decided to
have Princess Vishakha married..

54
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,958
...to the Prince of Aravalli,
much to my chagrin!

55
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,200
You did that knowing well ..

56
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:42,590
...that I'm the best 
suitor for the Princess.

57
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,399
You are impudent!

58
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,675
Have you forgotten that your
father was a small-time bandit?

59
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:54,035
It was I who made him a general.

60
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,493
It's you who are forgetting
the fact that the bandit..

61
00:05:57,897 --> 00:06:01,285
...often resorts to plunder
to take what he seeks.

62
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:06,168
You have spilt much blood for
your love for Queen Padmavati.

63
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:11,623
For the love I have for
Vishakha, I can draw blood too!

64
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:16,296
Durjan Singh's 
conspiracy bore fruit.

65
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:19,885
The King of Aravalli was accused
of murdering the King of Thambor.

66
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:23,376
He was sentenced to hang.

67
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:34,417
People of Thambor!
He is the assassin of your King!

68
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:41,313
Princess Vishakha has
decided to sentence him to death.

69
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:46,838
I'm not a murderer. It's your 
Grand Vizier who is the killer!

70
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:52,330
Believe what I say, Princess,
for I care not for my life.

71
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:57,287
I am concerned about you
and the fate of your kingdom.

72
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:10,256
The one who has killed the
men of Thambor says that!

73
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:15,506
Do command if you have
changed your decision, Princess.

74
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,091
The executioner 
awaits my signal.

75
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,809
After the incident, ..

76
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:50,111
...Queen Padmavati started
hating Princess Vishakha.

77
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:53,683
Now, she awaited the
return of her son Rajkumar.

78
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,631
She didn't know that Durjan Singh
had conspired with Sultan Ghori.

79
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,533
Her son had been
abducted from the hermitage.

80
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,496
And he was being held a
prisoner in Ghori's dungeons.

81
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:19,340
Let go of me! Have mercy! 
Please don't!

82
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,840
Who's next? Bring him here.

83
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:28,752
Take me before you take him.

84
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,758
Very well. Being him over.

85
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,245
No, my friend!

86
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,206
- Yes. My friend. - Move it.

87
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:05,023
How will you eat afterwards..
with your feet?

88
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,474
A Hindustani will
prefer his hands cut off..

89
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:14,120
...than eat the 
rations of a prison.

90
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:12,760
Well done, Prince.

91
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,309
Watch out!

92
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:21,911
I use my legs to feed the 
likes of you..not to eat.

93
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:32,274
You can't set them free, Prince.
But you can break my chains.

94
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:34,510
Come on, break my chains! 
Break my chains!

95
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,953
- Hurry! - Don't!

96
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:39,556
He's going to die anyway.
He has been condemned to die.

97
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:41,836
Forget him. Run for your life!

98
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,044
You can't escape 
without my help.

99
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:46,276
Don't listen to what he says.
He's one of them.

100
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,075
He can't be trusted.

101
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,398
Let's get out of here.

102
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,977
I know the way out of here.

103
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,293
Break my chain, Prince! 
Break my chains!

104
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,434
Himmat..

105
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:41,959
Forgive me friend. I'm leaving
you while I should've been with you.

106
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:46,006
No, Himmat! You're 
going to be all right.

107
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,170
We had come in together.
And we'll get out of here together.

108
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,517
You'll be all right.

109
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,324
My spirit travels with you.

110
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,071
Tell my mother that I
haven't failed my duty.

111
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:03,963
No. Himmat.

112
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,720
Ask her not to weep.

113
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:11,758
Do not look at me with
suspicion in your eyes.

114
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:17,256
From now on, I'll protect
Rajkumar with my life.

115
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:22,210
Till my last breath, I'll do
the duty that was yours.

116
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,496
I promise.

117
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:30,364
Himmat. Himmat.

118
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,389
Witch!

119
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:58,567
Witch!

120
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:14,573
Quiet, Witch!
Witch.. Be calmed.

121
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,590
It's me.. Durjan.

122
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:24,208
What do you want?

123
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:28,906
I have check-mated all my enemies.

124
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,917
My every design has succeeded; 
every wish is fulfilled.

125
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,973
But, I am still not satisfied.

126
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:41,898
What is it that you seek?

127
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:43,651
The Princess, Vishakha.

128
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:50,301
And what am I to get in return?

129
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,053
What do you want?

130
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:59,602
Your first-born.

131
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:04,111
I'm willing to pay any price
for the throne of Thambor.

132
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:10,639
May the powers of 
Seduction be bottled.

133
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,763
The powers of Seduction!

134
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:16,719
The powers of Seduction!

135
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,309
Take this.. 
The potion for Seduction.

136
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:28,347
A potion for Seduction?

137
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:34,130
It has the power to 
turn hatred into love.

138
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,707
Mix it with the 
waters in her bath.

139
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:42,667
She'll fall in love 
with the first man..

140
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,902
...she sets her eyes on after
she comes out of the bath.

141
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:52,615
Music must be played.
And should the clangor..

142
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:58,825
...of swords be heard, the
potion loses its potency. Beware!

143
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:08,107
Watch.. Marks of 
horses' hooves.

144
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,794
This road could lead 
us to some village.

145
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:15,973
I'll take time off to pray
while you scout the track.

146
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,489
May the Lord lead us 
on the right path.

147
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:27,386
Bulls-eye!

148
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:31,913
The target now in his eye.

149
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,320
He used this sling to give the
soldier a black eye, didn't he?

150
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,628
Let go of me!

151
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,396
Now soldiers, you must
praise me before my brother.

152
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,816
You must tell him that
General Sujan Singh..

153
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:48,705
...had become an 
accomplished marksman.

154
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,828
Fool! Why did you move?

155
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,410
You spoilt my aim!

156
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,827
Why are you shaking his hand?

157
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:01,883
Hold him! Catch him!
My target in running away.

158
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:18,127
A hand raised against an
innocent child will be severed.

159
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,781
Do you know the punishment
for sheltering a rebel?

160
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,359
Do you know the punishment
for oppression in my kingdom?

161
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,715
Your Kingdom!

162
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:29,480
Your Kingdom! And who are you?

163
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,383
I'm the Prince of Aravalli.

164
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:35,262
The Prince?!

165
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:38,991
The Prince of Aravalli!

166
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:49,879
Well all right!
I'll tell my brother about you!

167
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:59,892
Pour it into the bath for the
Princess tomorrow morning.

168
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:01,545
It will be as you 
command, Grand Vizier.

169
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:07,643
And remember, music
should continue to play. Take.

170
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:11,566
I bear secret tidings, Brother.

171
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:13,565
Should I come over to tell you?

172
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:15,359
Make it quick.

173
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:20,013
And make sure to address me
as Grand Vizier. Not just "brother".

174
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:28,933
- Walls have ears too. 
- What's up?

175
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:32,034
The Prince of
Aravalli has returned.

176
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:32,910
What?!

177
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:39,455
But he was in Sultan
Ghori's dungeons, wasn't he?

178
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:51,510
Looks like he's destined to be
killed by his father's assassin.

179
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,939
Prince!

180
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,379
Nanny!

181
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:32,190
Everything's over! Finished!

182
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,388
That's my friend, Ali.

183
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,579
Where's Himmat?

184
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,908
Do you recognise this 
pendant, Nanny?

185
00:18:56,988 --> 00:19:02,345
Yes. You'd wanted to take 
it from Himmat once.

186
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,448
He had quarreled with you.

187
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:07,228
He'd said he could 
give his life for you.

188
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:09,700
But, he wouldn't 
part with the pendant.

189
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:16,017
He has given it to me at last.

190
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:40,068
He died while he was
protecting you, didn't he?

191
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:41,651
Yes, he did.

192
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:51,471
We are indebted to 
you for Himmat.

193
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:06,017
If you ever ask me to
sacrifice my son, I shall oblige.

194
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:11,048
Aravalli would have 
celebrated the ..

195
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:16,767
...return of the 
Prince after 12 years.

196
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:21,446
But for the 
Princess of Thambor!

197
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,985
She hanged the 
King of Aravalli.

198
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:30,427
Since then, the lights
have not been lit in Aravalli.

199
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:34,467
We'll light camps 
by the King's grave..

200
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:38,724
...after all the lights in
Thambor have been put out.

201
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:45,974
I swear by you, Queen Mother.

202
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:50,494
I'll wreak vengeance 
upon Thambor.

203
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:54,085
And many generations in
Thambor will remember that.

204
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,367
Only afterwards, will I light
the lamp by my father's grave.

205
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,874
- I promise. 
- Long live the Prince.

206
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:28,412
Is that the land of Thambor?

207
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:29,696
Yes, it is.

208
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,776
Is the Grand Vizier
one Durjan Singh?

209
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:33,543
May be.

210
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:36,274
- Why Do you ask? 
- Do you know why I was..

211
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:38,515
- ...sentenced to die? - Why?

212
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:40,685
It was the doing of Durjan Singh.

213
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:45,875
It happened when Durjan Singh ..

214
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:49,340
...went to the Sultan 
to buy weapons.

215
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:56,871
Your friendship stands me
in good stead, Durjan Singh.

216
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:02,009
I'm getting twice the 
price for my weapons.

217
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:05,537
Twice the price for you; and
fourfold the brokerage for me.

218
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,490
And the profits 
lie in brokerage.

219
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:15,311
Very soon, the coffers of
Thambor are going to be empty.

220
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:20,435
Then, I shall be 
able to control Thambor.

221
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:24,803
And the King of Thambor
will be a pawn in my hands.

222
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:33,073
And the Princess of ..

223
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:38,326
...Thambor will be mine too.

224
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,203
Durjan Singh.

225
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,792
Escort him to his quarters.

226
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:52,173
May I say something, Sultan?

227
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:54,389
Go on. What's the matter?

228
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:59,861
To be an ingrate 
is the worst sin.

229
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:02,112
What do you mean?

230
00:23:02,193 --> 00:23:05,764
One who betrays the
trust of his employer ..

231
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:10,136
...is going to be treacherous.

232
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:15,369
This scoundrel 
was eavesdropping!

233
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:17,965
I doubt his intentions.

234
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:22,749
It might be dangerous 
if we let him live.

235
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,134
I can sacrifice a 
thousand like him ..

236
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,289
...for the sake 
of your friendship.

237
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:33,108
Take this traitor away.
He's sentenced to die.

238
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:36,513
You'll regret 
ignoring my advice.

239
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:41,366
I know what brings you here.

240
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:45,914
But remember that anger
is the Devils weapon.

241
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,678
Don't punish the Princess ..

242
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:52,018
...for what might've 
been Durjan Singh's plot.

243
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:18,905
If I'm not too wrong, ..

244
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:20,770
...there's bound to be a
secret passage leading inside.

245
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:22,784
You must search for the passage.

246
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:13,003
"This beautiful body."

247
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,525
"Will it wither 
away just like that."

248
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:21,211
"The one who will
douse the fire of my heart."

249
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:24,194
"Wonder when will he come."

250
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,870
"The one who will douse 
the fire of my heart."

251
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:31,108
"Wonder when will he come."

252
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:35,551
"This beautiful body."

253
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,810
"Will it wither 
away just like that."

254
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:24,732
"He should make me 
go crazy about him."

255
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:28,972
"He should go crazy about me."

256
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:33,844
"He should make me 
go crazy about him."

257
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:37,688
"He should go crazy about me."

258
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:43,822
"He should sleep in
the shade of my tresses."

259
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:48,088
"The one who 
warms my lonely bed."

260
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:51,098
"Wonder when he will come.."

261
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:54,713
"The one who 
warms my lonely bed."

262
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:58,100
"Wonder when he will come.."

263
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,526
"This beautiful body."

264
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:06,740
"Will it wither 
away just like that."

265
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:18,614
"They may fade away, 
before they bloom."

266
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:23,109
"These rosy cheeks of mine."

267
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:27,544
"They may fade away, 
before they bloom."

268
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,777
"These rosy cheeks of mine."

269
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:37,763
"They will begin to glow if
he comes and kisses them."

270
00:30:38,495 --> 00:30:41,867
"The one who quenches
the thirst on my lips."

271
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:44,859
"Wonder when he will come .."

272
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:48,525
"The one who quenches
the thirst on my lips."

273
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:51,772
"Wonder when he will come .."

274
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,048
"This beautiful body."

275
00:30:56,286 --> 00:31:00,597
"Will it wither 
away just like that."

276
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:04,091
"The one who will
douse the fire of my heart."

277
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:07,172
"Wonder when will he come."

278
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:10,732
"This beautiful body."

279
00:31:10,962 --> 00:31:13,811
"Will it wither 
away just like that."

280
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:18,227
"The one who will douse 
the fire of my heart."

281
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:22,865
"Wonder when will he come."

282
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,459
Men would die for those eyes.
But I can't believe that..

283
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,851
...you have killed someone.

284
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:02,139
Lips which trembled 
when a bird was hurt..

285
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,192
...wouldn't have pronounced
a death sentence on someone.

286
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:10,719
- Who are you? 
- The Prince of Aravalli.

287
00:32:11,993 --> 00:32:13,549
The enemy!

288
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:18,467
I'll have you arrested and
thrown in the dungeons.

289
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:22,523
But why do I yearn to 
take you in my arms?!

290
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,114
I'll have you flogged in public.

291
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:29,879
But why do I crave 
to kiss you so?!

292
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:34,014
I'll be glad to see 
you hacked into pieces.

293
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:38,054
But why do I hunger 
for your embrace?

294
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:41,572
I hate you so intensely.

295
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:47,247
But why must I seek
your love so intensely?!

296
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,262
I have heard that intense
hatred creates love.

297
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:58,358
I see it happening now!
I had come here to kill you.

298
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:00,531
Why don't you?

299
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:06,435
Because I want to find out how 
it is to love the one I hate.

300
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:10,266
Arrest him!

301
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:25,527
Open your eyes, Ali!

302
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:29,873
I can't open my eyes standing in
women's quarters. It's prohibited.

303
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:32,820
If you don't open your eyes
now, you never will.. You fool!

304
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:37,086
Goodness! Fencing in 
a lady's bathroom!

305
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,517
If my mentor heard of
this, he'd banish me forever.

306
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:42,971
You'll see him if you 
ever get out of here.

307
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:46,429
Tell me.. Have the ladies left?

308
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:51,172
- I can't see any 
woman here. - Thank you.

309
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,907
- God forbid! - My love!

310
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,714
Save my soul, Prince! Who's this?
What's going on around here?!

311
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:38,769
It's called "hatred" in here.

312
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:40,029
Save my soul!

313
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:43,848
Hey! Let's get out of here!

314
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:47,170
Where are you off to Princess?!
I've fallen for you already.

315
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:53,545
What's it now? Come along Prince!
We've had enough!

316
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:57,143
I've given you my heart.
I'll come later to take your heart.

317
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:02,377
If you come for my heart,
you'll lose your head.

318
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:12,609
Follow them!

319
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,375
Run, Sajni.

320
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,234
Sajni.

321
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:31,040
I hear you were
inconvenienced in my absence.

322
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:33,873
It wasn't any inconvenience.
He was the Prince of Aravalli.

323
00:36:36,926 --> 00:36:42,346
Blame him not, for he's human
enough to have fallen for you.

324
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:43,842
He's our enemy.

325
00:36:44,357 --> 00:36:49,109
I think there are 
lapses in your security.

326
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:53,877
Do trust Durjan Singh ..

327
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,299
...to take care of even 
the most minor things.

328
00:36:58,214 --> 00:37:00,712
As of now, I've suspended
the chief of the palace guards.

329
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,779
And, the strength of the group
of guards has been quadrupled.

330
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:11,523
And I shall personally stand
guard for you at all times.

331
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:18,052
So long as you do not
step into my quarters!

332
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:21,740
Your wish in my 
command, Princess.

333
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:28,022
But, I'd rather that 
you carry my dagger.

334
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:30,406
- Why? - Because..

335
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:37,893
...it's as beautiful as you are,
and as dear to me as you are.

336
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,884
Keep it close to your heart,
and danger can ever touch you.

337
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,959
If anyone does, despite that..

338
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,206
Thank you.

339
00:37:49,286 --> 00:37:52,092
- One more request. - Go on.

340
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:56,888
Please do not let anyone
else have the dagger.

341
00:37:57,072 --> 00:38:00,724
You would give my 
life away with it.

342
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:03,301
Rest assured, Grand Vizier.

343
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,527
Anything else?

344
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:12,233
Please shut the
door behind you.

345
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:31,925
Are you still 
awake, Queen Mother?

346
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:35,866
The mother wakes for her son.

347
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,583
Is my mother not
confident of my capability?

348
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:40,330
Did you overcome the enemy?

349
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,743
How could we have done that?

350
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,645
The floor in the ladies
bathroom was too slippery for us.

351
00:38:49,898 --> 00:38:53,829
- Prince?! 
- The Princess is not heartless.

352
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:55,709
How have you arrived 
at that decision?

353
00:38:56,148 --> 00:39:00,628
One who cares for even a
wounded bird cannot be a tyrant.

354
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:04,359
The Princess
is very beautiful.

355
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:06,130
She's innocent.

356
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,786
And beautiful too.

357
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:10,020
Yes. She's beautiful too.

358
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:16,743
I see that you have already lost
Aravalli to Princess of Thambor.

359
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:23,308
Do not be harsh. There's no 
reason to doubt his loyalty.

360
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:29,106
The Prince is young 
and youth in blind.

361
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:33,461
Not only youth.. 
Hatred is blind too.

362
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:41,069
What you don't know is
the story of her atrocities.

363
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:15,709
No!

364
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:04,900
Don't kill me! I'm only 
following the General's orders!

365
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:08,699
Which General?

366
00:41:09,324 --> 00:41:11,357
- That clown?! 
- Right. That's him!

367
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:13,337
Coming over, General!

368
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:16,644
A girl! A girl!

369
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,764
I want a girl!

370
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:21,341
The damn boner is nearly gone!

371
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,013
Soldiers!

372
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:26,427
I want a girl! 
I want a girl right now!

373
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,556
She has arrived.

374
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:30,962
Where's she?

375
00:41:30,974 --> 00:41:33,438
I'm right here, my General.

376
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,150
She's a wee bit 
large, isn't that so..

377
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:39,991
And do you fellows intend
to watch the show now?

378
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:43,968
- Get out of here! 
- Go on.. Out of here.

379
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:48,436
I'm feeling shy.

380
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:55,138
I'd asked the soldiers to get 
me fast girl! Not a shy one.

381
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:57,264
- I'm still a Virgin. 
- Never mind that.

382
00:41:57,344 --> 00:41:59,411
Just drop that veil.
Let me take a look at you.

383
00:41:59,737 --> 00:42:01,576
Will you just keep 
looking at me?!

384
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:05,781
That's great! 
You're really fast one!

385
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:09,529
Drop that veil and 
show we some more.

386
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,590
Go on.. Let's have 
some more of you!

387
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:14,553
Put out the lights.

388
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:18,045
How will I take a look
at you without lights?

389
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:23,085
I'm not someone to see.
I'm something to feel.

390
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:29,702
Stop ogling at me, Prince Frog.

391
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:31,020
And close your eyes.

392
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:33,924
All right! I can't see a 
thing now! I'm blind!

393
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,536
Now sit down here.

394
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:38,020
Won't you sit down beside me?

395
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:40,397
Here I am.

396
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,974
I'm a bit heavy, am I not?

397
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:45,322
I bit large and heavy too.

398
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:51,569
Have patience, my General. 
Slowly does it.

399
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:57,253
"Go slowly in the 
garden, my general."

400
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:01,202
"Go slowly in the 
garden, my general."

401
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:04,552
- What's that? 
- The sting of love.

402
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:08,847
Love sting! And it is loud!

403
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:11,272
It is resonant!

404
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:15,281
- Isn't that so? 
- It does resonate!

405
00:43:17,446 --> 00:43:21,607
- What's this now?! 
- My embrace.

406
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,680
This one is tough.

407
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:29,190
Tough enough to break stones.

408
00:43:30,712 --> 00:43:35,199
It used to be the 
woman who would scream.

409
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,712
Today, it's the 
General screaming!

410
00:43:38,404 --> 00:43:41,391
- She could be a tough one. 
- A tough one?!

411
00:43:41,844 --> 00:43:43,142
Want me to get my sword?

412
00:43:46,353 --> 00:43:48,272
Why did you trip me?

413
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:51,965
This is just the beginning.

414
00:43:55,598 --> 00:43:56,830
What's this?

415
00:43:58,476 --> 00:44:02,602
- It is my hair. 
- Hair.. On your arms?

416
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:07,199
My body is all 
covered with dark hair.

417
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:10,038
What a woman! 
You're more like a bear.

418
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,478
- Want to take a look? 
- Oh yes!

419
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:24,907
The Prince of Aravalli!

420
00:44:34,045 --> 00:44:37,043
Ask your friend 
to let go of me.

421
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:40,315
You must promise not to
molest women anymore.

422
00:44:42,743 --> 00:44:43,866
I promise.

423
00:44:44,152 --> 00:44:47,591
Promise me never 
to hurt an innocent.

424
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:49,766
All right.. I promise!

425
00:44:49,846 --> 00:44:51,190
Please let go of me now.

426
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:53,770
Only after you've 
answered a few questions.

427
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:56,136
Where does it rain 
most in Turkey?

428
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:00,439
Who is he?

429
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:03,150
Professor Ali.
He's teacher geography.

430
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,188
- I see.. Hello professor! 
- Hello to you.

431
00:45:07,478 --> 00:45:09,307
And I teach history.

432
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:13,749
Did the Third Battle for
Panipat precede the Fourth?

433
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:16,784
How would I know? 
I wasn't born then.

434
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:20,426
I might answer if you ask
me anything about out times.

435
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:22,802
Who killed the
King of Thambor?

436
00:45:22,814 --> 00:45:24,227
The King of Thambor was..

437
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:28,388
Oh I see! You want me to 
tattle about my brother!

438
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:29,568
Who's your brother?

439
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,529
Don't you know
who my brother is?

440
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:33,974
Durjan Singh! 
The Grand Vizier of Thambor.

441
00:45:34,054 --> 00:45:36,138
So it was your brother who
killed the King of Thambor!

442
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:37,380
Oh yes.

443
00:45:38,022 --> 00:45:40,853
If my brother gets wind of this,
he's going to give me a thrashing.

444
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:42,127
I won't say anything more.

445
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,087
Forget him, Prince.

446
00:45:43,168 --> 00:45:44,804
He's a moron.

447
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:45,565
You're right.

448
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,388
Lets find someone with brains.

449
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:48,728
I'm not a moron! I'm smart enough.
And I know a lot of things.

450
00:45:48,808 --> 00:45:50,487
And I know what
comes afterwards.

451
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:51,368
What do you know?

452
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:54,683
My brother is going to be
crowned King of Thambor.

453
00:45:54,764 --> 00:45:56,365
Will he imprison the Princess?

454
00:45:56,444 --> 00:45:58,572
No. He'll marry the Princess.

455
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:00,012
The Princess won't concede.

456
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:01,255
How can she refuse him?

457
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:04,968
That's why my brother is
sending her a charmed anklet.

458
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:07,934
She will wear the anklet while
she dances during the festival.

459
00:46:08,014 --> 00:46:10,363
- Oh the day of the festival?! 
- Oh yes.

460
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:12,366
And the charm will seduce
her as soon as she wears it.

461
00:46:12,447 --> 00:46:15,138
You're lying. How can 
there be a charmed anklet?

462
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:21,089
There is. The other day, he
tried the potion for seducing her.

463
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:21,795
Did he?

464
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:23,723
Yes he did.
Unfortunately for him..

465
00:46:23,802 --> 00:46:26,069
...you arrived on the scene
and interrupted him. Otherwise..

466
00:46:26,148 --> 00:46:28,681
...the Princess would've
been my sister-in-law by now.

467
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:30,273
And I would've become..

468
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:31,504
The Grand Vizier!

469
00:46:33,071 --> 00:46:36,565
Both of you seem to
be well-versed in history!

470
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:40,946
And you're ill-versed 
in geography.

471
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:46,022
Aren't you happy 
to see me again?

472
00:46:54,786 --> 00:46:57,693
I'd love to have 
you pierce my heart.

473
00:46:58,263 --> 00:47:01,000
Before that, I must 
tell you something.

474
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:05,110
Want to show me another
example of your hypocrisy?

475
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:09,382
Please give me a 
chance to speak.

476
00:47:09,987 --> 00:47:11,774
I'll grant you a thousand
chances with the sword afterwards.

477
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:23,590
Tall me what you must 
before I kill you.

478
00:47:23,864 --> 00:47:27,162
You must come closer
to my heart to hear that.

479
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,250
I'm madly in love with you.
And I swear by my love for you..

480
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,908
...that my father wasn't
involved in your father's murder.

481
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,196
It was a conspiracy
hatched by your Grand Vizier.

482
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:48,567
- Impossible. 
- It's the truth.

483
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:52,806
And another conspiracy is
being hatched at the moment.

484
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:56,922
Your Grand Vizier's device is
going to be given to you soon.

485
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,501
What conspiracy?

486
00:47:58,513 --> 00:48:00,696
It is a charmed anklet.

487
00:48:00,886 --> 00:48:03,032
The anklets you'll wear for the
festival are going to be charmed.

488
00:48:03,357 --> 00:48:05,018
And later, you'll fall to
the Grand Vizier's charms.

489
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:10,107
You mustn't wear the anklets.

490
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:14,402
I'll surely wear the anklets.

491
00:48:18,123 --> 00:48:22,017
Trust me, Princess. 
I'll be there too.

492
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:26,083
If I'm wrong, 
you can behead me.

493
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,301
I'd rather die than 
fail to win your love.

494
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:33,897
But I won't let my love
for you end in a heartbreak.

495
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:41,946
I'm leaving.

496
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,623
The Grand Vizier has 
sent anklets for you.

497
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:07,805
On this birthday of our
Lord Krishna, the Princess..

498
00:49:07,886 --> 00:49:14,378
...will perform a dance,
invoking the blessings of the Lord.

499
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:20,671
The Princess will give 500
gold coins to any artiste..

500
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,691
...who can provide 
accompaniment to her.

501
00:49:25,772 --> 00:49:28,357
Is there any artiste who
may accept the challenge?

502
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:34,482
I challenge the lady.

503
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:40,079
I'm Ghungroo Prasad 
Jhinjhoti from Ballia.

504
00:49:40,317 --> 00:49:45,956
The challenge to
what's she called?

505
00:49:45,968 --> 00:49:48,199
The Princess.

506
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:50,205
Yes.. The Princess.

507
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:58,822
If the Princess 
can dance to my tune,..

508
00:49:59,281 --> 00:50:04,533
...I'll give her 
1000 gold coins.

509
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:10,182
Do you accept the 
challenge, Princess?

510
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:19,939
Done. And I'll 
outdo you at your game.

511
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:26,767
Will said, Princess. Let's start
in the name of the Lord Krishna.

512
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:09,056
"The anklets tinkle."

513
00:51:13,714 --> 00:51:16,365
"Are you lightening."

514
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:20,224
"Or a butterfly."

515
00:51:21,565 --> 00:51:23,710
"Are you lightening."

516
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,547
"Or a butterfly"

517
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:29,876
"I have a drum in my hands."

518
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:38,496
"I will make you dance
to the beat of my drum."

519
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:40,987
"Or I'm not worthy of my name."

520
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:44,556
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

521
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:47,046
"I'm not worthy of my name."

522
00:51:47,214 --> 00:51:50,301
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

523
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,125
"I'm not worthy of my name."

524
00:51:53,206 --> 00:51:59,335
"You are a man worthless."

525
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:04,895
"You are a man worthless."

526
00:52:04,974 --> 00:52:09,040
"One bell in my 
anklet is missing."

527
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:18,033
"I'll make you a 
bell of my anklet."

528
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:20,717
"Or I am not worthy of my name."

529
00:52:20,797 --> 00:52:23,815
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

530
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:26,331
"I'm not worthy of my name."

531
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:29,744
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

532
00:52:29,824 --> 00:52:32,991
"I'm not worthy of my name."

533
00:53:17,455 --> 00:53:21,580
"You are neither 
the sun, nor the moon."

534
00:53:21,755 --> 00:53:26,154
"You are an ordinary human."

535
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:35,335
"I have decided in my heart"

536
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:46,018
"I'll remove the 
daylights out of you."

537
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,701
"Or I'm not worthy of my name."

538
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:52,014
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

539
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:54,736
"I'm not worthy of my name."

540
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:58,010
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

541
00:53:58,089 --> 00:54:01,134
"I'm not worthy of my name."

542
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:27,574
"It is very obvious."

543
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:31,712
"You are destined to die!"

544
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:37,228
"How do these talks matter."

545
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:41,074
"There is anger in your eyes."

546
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:48,139
"If I don't teach you to love"

547
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:50,935
"I am not worthy of my name."

548
00:54:51,014 --> 00:54:54,103
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

549
00:54:54,183 --> 00:54:56,654
"I'm not worthy of my name."

550
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:59,904
"If I don't make you 
swallow your pride"

551
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:03,116
"I'm not worthy of my name."

552
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:46,743
The young man deserves 
the 500 gold coins.

553
00:55:47,016 --> 00:55:49,690
I was quite willing to lay
down my life, Princess.

554
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,513
If you were even 
to ask for my life, ..

555
00:55:51,592 --> 00:55:54,407
...I'd lay it down 
just as easily.

556
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:57,647
If you permit me, Princess
I'd rather see his wish fulfilled.

557
00:55:58,101 --> 00:56:01,190
I would've permitted 
you myself, Minister.

558
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,081
But I'm in a hurry just now.

559
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:04,473
Now, where's my toupee?

560
00:56:04,485 --> 00:56:06,020
Are you really in a hurry?

561
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:10,248
Or, are you unsure of
my sense of hospitality?

562
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,708
Say what, Prince of Aravalli?

563
00:56:14,156 --> 00:56:15,407
The Prince of Aravalli?!

564
00:56:15,835 --> 00:56:21,286
The dungeons in Thambor have 
long awaited this royal guest.

565
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,036
This is unjust.

566
00:56:29,578 --> 00:56:31,875
Why did you at all 
organise this contest?

567
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:33,715
Had I known this 
is a battlefield ..

568
00:56:33,795 --> 00:56:35,636
...in the guise of 
a musical conference..

569
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:37,857
...I wouldn't have come unarmed.

570
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:45,136
Allow me to call it
foolishness on your part.

571
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:51,075
People pay a price to die.
For you, this has come for free.

572
00:56:51,436 --> 00:56:52,715
Take him away.

573
00:56:54,692 --> 00:56:58,188
All things that come for
free are invaluable, Durjan..

574
00:56:58,574 --> 00:57:02,316
...as the air and the water.

575
00:57:02,775 --> 00:57:05,130
And love is priceless too.

576
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:10,232
Do you call this dying? I would 
have died were it not for love.

577
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:22,099
Your loyalty and acumen has
won the hearts of all in Thambor.

578
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:26,071
What about you?

579
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:28,531
How can I tell
you how much I do!

580
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:32,275
By spending this night with me.

581
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:36,493
Do you want to see 
passions inflamed?

582
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,422
No. I want to see 
the flame melt.

583
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:51,194
What do you seek, my minister?

584
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,473
I hope you won't 
mind my saying it.

585
00:57:57,096 --> 00:58:02,273
Tonight I am no Princess.
And you are no Grand Vizier.

586
00:58:02,895 --> 00:58:05,965
Tell me what you have in mind.

587
00:58:07,426 --> 00:58:08,994
I seek you.

588
00:58:09,855 --> 00:58:14,605
After you, comes 
Thambor, Aravalli, ..

589
00:58:15,054 --> 00:58:19,878
...and finally, 
the rest of Hindustan.

590
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:23,011
What if I refuse?

591
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:26,219
- That's out of question. 
- Why?

592
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,570
Because I hold you 
under a spell.

593
00:58:30,485 --> 00:58:31,863
By way of the charmed anklets?

594
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,047
How do you know of that?

595
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:38,551
The night cometh.. 
And I am feeling sleepy.

596
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:48,304
You will find many 
more nights to sleep.

597
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,964
But this night may not 
be wasted in sleep.

598
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:53,974
What else is this 
night meant for?

599
00:58:55,884 --> 00:58:58,049
This is a night for 
crossing the limits.

600
00:58:58,128 --> 00:59:01,628
What if this becomes public?

601
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,714
I shall marry you.

602
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:07,013
Before that I must have that
insolent Prince beheaded.

603
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:10,241
My soldiers will 
behead him very soon.

604
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:12,520
The soldiers? Why the soldiers?!

605
00:59:12,775 --> 00:59:16,768
He's my enemy. I'd like to 
do it with my own hands.

606
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:21,476
The mistress' wish is a
command for the knave.

607
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:51,333
This is what happens when
love tugs at the heart strings.

608
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:56,304
I was about to see you before I left.
But you're here yourself!

609
00:59:56,516 --> 01:00:00,159
But why did you have
to bring this fellow along?

610
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:02,842
He's a complete 
misfit beside you.

611
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,415
How does it feel to face death?

612
01:00:13,752 --> 01:00:15,821
It's as if I see my life
standing before me.

613
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:19,580
But I'm sorry to note that
you are being forced to use..

614
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:23,500
...a sword. You could've killed
me if you gave me your heart.

615
01:00:24,478 --> 01:00:28,496
Thambor awaits your 
reply, Princess.

616
01:00:28,576 --> 01:00:33,786
If it's a question of Thambor,
I must thank the Prince.

617
01:00:34,938 --> 01:00:37,422
He had warned me about 
the charmed anklets.

618
01:00:38,366 --> 01:00:40,422
I didn't wear the anklets.

619
01:00:41,893 --> 01:00:45,455
And you, my Grand Vizier
should be bound in chains..

620
01:00:45,947 --> 01:00:48,306
...and put on display 
at the crossroads.

621
01:00:48,777 --> 01:00:51,184
Soldiers! 
Arrest the Grand Vizier!

622
01:01:00,842 --> 01:01:03,781
Don't you hear me?!
Arrest the Grand Vizier.

623
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,174
I command you!

624
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:12,251
No one has a right to be
as beautiful as you are.

625
01:01:13,898 --> 01:01:20,664
The maker must've lost sleep for
many days after he had made you.

626
01:01:21,868 --> 01:01:27,297
Do you know how you've endangered
yourself by trying to fool me?

627
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,107
I killed the Kings of Aravalli
and Thambor for your sake.

628
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:43,371
Can you imagine how
I'm going to punish you?

629
01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:48,369
Even I can't save you
from the consequences.

630
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:07,921
Your eyes have stabbed me 
in the heart. I'll gouge..

631
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:15,882
...those eyes out, 
and feed them to the ants.

632
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:24,386
Angels would fly down
to kiss you on the lips.

633
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:29,449
I'll slit your lips 
from ear to ear.

634
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:38,830
The worms deep down in the
earth would never have imagined..

635
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:46,933
...that they'd feed 
on your beautiful body.

636
01:02:48,112 --> 01:02:51,667
But before that, beautiful
creature, thou shall be mine!

637
01:02:52,777 --> 01:02:58,987
Chop his head off and
send it to my boudoir.

638
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:06,378
He may yet see his
beloved being raped by me.

639
01:03:06,844 --> 01:03:08,067
Take him away!

640
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:57,208
I'll avenge my father's death.

641
01:04:10,898 --> 01:04:14,206
I'll avenge my mother's tears.

642
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,830
I'll avenge the angst
of every man in Aravalli.

643
01:04:35,427 --> 01:04:38,311
Don't Princess, Don't!

644
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:42,750
I can't permit you to
do that to my brother.

645
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:53,433
I can't hold this woman!

646
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,893
Sound the alarm!

647
01:05:07,456 --> 01:05:09,022
I'm a goner.

648
01:05:11,643 --> 01:05:13,473
I'm finished.

649
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,590
Hold the Prince!

650
01:05:18,154 --> 01:05:21,136
Run away, Prince! 
You are in grave danger.

651
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,070
Yes. My life is in danger.

652
01:05:24,936 --> 01:05:25,990
What are you doing?

653
01:05:26,002 --> 01:05:27,322
Trying to save my life.

654
01:05:28,297 --> 01:05:30,154
- Why did you stop? 
- Is that the way out?

655
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:31,473
Oh yes it is! Now get going!

656
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:53,540
Soldiers! Rush inside.

657
01:05:54,464 --> 01:05:57,869
The Grand Vizier is in danger!
The General has revolted!

658
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,792
Well done, Prince!

659
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:24,936
What are you thinking about?

660
01:07:28,951 --> 01:07:33,281
Life is more exciting 
with a dash of risk.

661
01:07:34,424 --> 01:07:36,536
But, it's a risk nevertheless!

662
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:42,572
Had you worn the anklets,
it would've killed me.

663
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:47,657
What's so special 
about these anklets?

664
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,567
Those anklets are charmed.
The one to wear those..

665
01:07:55,967 --> 01:07:58,057
...might lose 
control of herself.

666
01:08:00,192 --> 01:08:06,049
The mind and 
body aches for love.

667
01:08:06,308 --> 01:08:10,359
In that case, I'll 
wear them right away.

668
01:08:18,337 --> 01:08:22,639
"My anklets cast a spell."

669
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,927
"They call you."

670
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:28,147
"What do I do?"

671
01:08:31,578 --> 01:08:35,951
"The crazy weather 
is making me crazy."

672
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:38,256
"It calls out to you."

673
01:08:38,336 --> 01:08:41,080
"What do I do."

674
01:08:44,969 --> 01:08:49,281
"My anklets cast a spell."

675
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,600
"They call you."

676
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,241
"What do I do?"

677
01:08:58,315 --> 01:09:02,618
"The crazy weather 
is making me crazy."

678
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:04,960
"It calls out to you."

679
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,940
"What do I do."

680
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:52,193
"What is this sweet pain
that has seeped into my body."

681
01:09:52,640 --> 01:10:00,594
"The love bug has bitten me."

682
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:07,369
"Come, my darling, 
who has stopped you."

683
01:10:07,448 --> 01:10:09,587
"We have the time, 
the opportunity."

684
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:12,613
"Let me lie in your arms."

685
01:10:16,335 --> 01:10:22,854
"Don't be crazy, it's 
a spell, a deception."

686
01:10:22,934 --> 01:10:26,232
"It is just a naughty
phase, let it pass away."

687
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:59,121
"What has happened to
you, come to your senses."

688
01:11:59,622 --> 01:12:06,536
"Even I am beginning 
to get mesmerized."

689
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:14,219
"Why don't you understand,
how naive you are."

690
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:19,623
"You are very innocent, 
of no use to me."

691
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:27,602
"I have understood,
but I am crazy about you"

692
01:12:27,796 --> 01:12:32,987
"I truly love you, 
it's not a sham."

693
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:41,046
"My anklets cast a spell."

694
01:12:41,126 --> 01:12:43,326
"They call you."

695
01:12:43,406 --> 01:12:46,250
"What do I do?"

696
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:54,483
"The crazy weather 
is making me crazy."

697
01:12:54,563 --> 01:12:56,828
"It calls out to you."

698
01:12:57,542 --> 01:12:59,786
"What do I do."

699
01:13:05,717 --> 01:13:07,377
- Ali. - Yes, Queen Mother?

700
01:13:07,961 --> 01:13:10,028
Where is Prince?

701
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,293
He should be here any
moment with the Princess.

702
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,174
Well done, Prince!

703
01:13:16,278 --> 01:13:19,162
Aravalli is going to 
be avenged at last!

704
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,135
We'll burn the 
Princess at the stakes.

705
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:31,304
And the bonfire will light the
lamp beside the King's grave.

706
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,809
Hello, Brother!

707
01:13:39,055 --> 01:13:42,882
Hello Brother.. Er.. I mean..
Grand Vizier, Sire!

708
01:13:43,094 --> 01:13:45,811
I have good news 
as well as bad news.

709
01:13:46,059 --> 01:13:47,704
Which would you 
like to hear first?

710
01:13:48,064 --> 01:13:52,396
Don't try my patience. 
Just tell me what you must, quickly.

711
01:13:52,475 --> 01:13:57,032
Well all right..the good news 
is that I'm back alive.

712
01:13:57,113 --> 01:14:00,059
What's bad is there's no news
yet of the Prince & the Princes.

713
01:14:00,139 --> 01:14:01,327
Shall we sit down 
for supper now?

714
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:05,042
Moron!

715
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:06,900
Imbecile..

716
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,882
You imbecile!

717
01:14:10,314 --> 01:14:11,663
Stupid..

718
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:15,324
The fool takes pleasure 
in getting abused!

719
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:21,395
- What would that mean? 
- Shut up!

720
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:35,657
Do you recognise her?

721
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:39,238
How can I ever 
forget that face?

722
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:41,587
On her face is 
writ the destruction ..

723
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:43,029
...that has befallen Aravalli.

724
01:14:43,716 --> 01:14:45,880
Hers is the face ridden with guilt.
She killed the King.

725
01:14:46,197 --> 01:14:51,144
Long live the Prince.

726
01:14:51,224 --> 01:14:53,163
She dies at the stake!

727
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:57,105
- Yes! Burn her alive! 
- Burn her!

728
01:15:11,446 --> 01:15:14,153
Hold it! Where are you 
taking the Princess?

729
01:15:14,233 --> 01:15:15,693
On her final journey!

730
01:15:17,302 --> 01:15:18,799
We'll kill her!

731
01:15:20,073 --> 01:15:21,753
Let's burn her alive!

732
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:24,755
Burn her alive!

733
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:28,774
Let me go!

734
01:15:31,706 --> 01:15:35,779
Hold it! The Princess hasn't 
yet been proven guilty.

735
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:40,493
Under the laws in Aravalli, a
verdict isn't pronounced this way.

736
01:15:40,573 --> 01:15:42,816
Step out of our way, Prince!

737
01:15:42,895 --> 01:15:47,090
Else, we might even choose 
to forget who you are.

738
01:15:50,055 --> 01:15:51,270
Scoundrel!

739
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:59,662
You must stop them, Mother.
They are going berserk.

740
01:15:59,742 --> 01:16:02,741
The voice of the people
is the voice of God.

741
01:16:03,014 --> 01:16:04,809
It is the sacred 
duty of every King ..

742
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:06,023
...to heed the 
verdict of the people.

743
01:16:06,296 --> 01:16:11,536
But this is sacrilege. It'll be 
a grave sin to kill the Princess.

744
01:16:11,907 --> 01:16:14,319
What happened in Thambor 
was a grave sin.

745
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:18,577
The King was implicated
falsely for murder and slain.

746
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:20,312
Fires of hatred 
cannot quench each other.

747
01:16:20,391 --> 01:16:22,792
The fires that 
consume the Princess..

748
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:25,880
...will light the lamp by the
grave of the deceased King.

749
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,908
You'd commit the same sin ..

750
01:16:29,988 --> 01:16:32,020
...that you want to 
punish the Princess for.

751
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,698
The Princess stood by watching
silently while the King was slain.

752
01:16:35,778 --> 01:16:38,443
Will you stand silently
and watch her being killed?

753
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:40,760
This is injustice!

754
01:16:40,841 --> 01:16:44,104
A wayward Prince way 
need not advise ..

755
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:46,759
...the Queen of 
Aravalli about justice.

756
01:16:47,799 --> 01:16:50,569
Do not force me to 
take up arms, Mother.

757
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:53,701
Will you take to arms to protect
the one who killed your father?

758
01:16:53,782 --> 01:16:55,550
Will you revolt against
Aravalli for her sake?!

759
01:16:56,015 --> 01:17:01,426
Fie on you! 
For you have fallen to lust!

760
01:17:01,902 --> 01:17:03,783
Your son begs you for justice.

761
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,543
I am sworn to use my sword
to protect truth and justice.

762
01:17:06,795 --> 01:17:08,908
I won't hesitate 
to wield my sword ..

763
01:17:08,988 --> 01:17:12,775
...against Aravalli 
for I am forsworn.

764
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:19,936
Aravalli is beholden to me.

765
01:17:20,016 --> 01:17:25,662
I am indebted to you for the
blood coursing in my veins.

766
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:31,910
But, truth and justice 
stands above all.

767
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:33,714
It is war, then.

768
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:38,795
A war between loyal forces
and a treacherous Prince.

769
01:17:39,744 --> 01:17:44,470
I am no traitor. I fight to
defend the principles I hold dear.

770
01:17:48,394 --> 01:17:50,813
And I am bound by my
convictions and my promises.

771
01:17:51,019 --> 01:17:52,360
Yes, my Queen.

772
01:17:55,783 --> 01:17:57,825
You are most certainly 
bound by your words.

773
01:17:58,993 --> 01:18:03,455
Do you see this? And do you
remember the promise you made me?

774
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,402
You'd promised me in return for
the martyrdom of my son Himmat..

775
01:18:06,784 --> 01:18:11,126
...that you'd even give me the
Prince's life if I ever so desire.

776
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,938
The Prince's life?!

777
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:18,359
Yes. The Princess of Thambor
is what the Prince lives for.

778
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:22,416
You're crossing the limit, Panna.

779
01:18:26,242 --> 01:18:28,732
I know well, the
confines I am restricted to.

780
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,332
But I was the midwife
who delivered the Prince.

781
01:18:32,983 --> 01:18:35,781
I saw him even before you.

782
01:18:37,073 --> 01:18:39,864
I heard him cry before you did.

783
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:44,074
And I hear him today too.
He begs his mother..

784
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:47,889
...for the Prince's life.

785
01:18:51,671 --> 01:18:55,982
I shall never forgive 
you, Panna. Never!

786
01:18:58,411 --> 01:19:00,355
The Princess is to 
be held prisoner ..

787
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:01,815
...and accorded the 
status of a slave.

788
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:18,504
What are you doing?!

789
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:29,996
She was born a Princess.
She can never be anyone's slave.

790
01:19:30,594 --> 01:19:34,020
You mustn't have 
disobeyed the Queen.

791
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:39,772
I can't bear the woman
I love to be trifled with.

792
01:19:40,362 --> 01:19:42,073
It isn't a trifle.

793
01:19:42,732 --> 01:19:47,355
The King of Aravalli was
slain while I looked on.

794
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:50,505
I am guilty.

795
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:54,208
The one who is guilty 
is Durjan Singh.

796
01:19:54,939 --> 01:19:58,392
To fulfill my promise to
my mother, and to erase..

797
01:19:58,471 --> 01:20:01,388
...the stigma that taints
you, I must kill Durjan Singh.

798
01:20:01,467 --> 01:20:03,587
But, Durjan is not alone.

799
01:20:04,836 --> 01:20:08,627
He has a large force, and
his armory is well-stocked.

800
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:11,020
How are to we find the
weapons to launch an attach?

801
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,962
We must loot the ones 
who have robbed us.

802
01:20:17,257 --> 01:20:20,715
Here's the first piece of
weapon for your arsenal.

803
01:21:04,564 --> 01:21:08,997
A beautiful woman 
needs no ornaments.

804
01:21:45,175 --> 01:21:49,450
We must seek the help 
of the Grand Vizier.

805
01:21:49,587 --> 01:21:51,435
Greetings, Grand Vizier.

806
01:21:51,515 --> 01:21:54,828
The Prince of 
Aravalli is up to loot.

807
01:21:55,009 --> 01:21:56,536
It has become very risky
to travel with valuables.

808
01:21:56,616 --> 01:21:59,220
Businessmen are scared to
travel with their merchandise.

809
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,377
If he isn't arrested soon,
we are going to be undone.

810
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:07,917
There's but one cure for all men.

811
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:10,554
The courtesan
Chameli (Jasmine).

812
01:22:10,566 --> 01:22:12,573
Chameli?! Who might she be?

813
01:22:12,653 --> 01:22:14,375
Who is this Chameli?

814
01:22:14,456 --> 01:22:17,965
Don't you know her?
She sings like a nightingale.

815
01:22:18,156 --> 01:22:21,140
If that Prince hears
her sing, he'll fall for her.

816
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:26,707
We must seek her help 
to trap the Prince.

817
01:22:27,395 --> 01:22:28,460
Why so?

818
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:34,755
Because my brother is simply not
up to catching up with the Prince.

819
01:22:34,957 --> 01:22:35,951
I see!

820
01:22:36,032 --> 01:22:40,922
That's right! My brother 
runs scared of the Prince.

821
01:22:41,635 --> 01:22:42,814
I see!

822
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:51,592
The other day, the Prince had
beaten my brother black and blue!

823
01:22:51,859 --> 01:22:54,045
I happened to interfere
in the nick of time.

824
01:22:54,126 --> 01:22:55,780
That saved the day.

825
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:58,899
And the Princess fell for me!

826
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:04,460
She told me that 
my brother is an ass.

827
01:23:04,743 --> 01:23:07,023
I should have become
the Grand Vizier, she said.

828
01:23:07,103 --> 01:23:12,487
And then she asked me
for a date that evening.

829
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:14,450
What do you say to that?

830
01:23:14,462 --> 01:23:16,357
Well, what I said was..

831
01:23:23,971 --> 01:23:27,576
How many times have I told
you not to try impersonating me!

832
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,797
- Get out of here! 
- Right away.. I will.

833
01:23:30,877 --> 01:23:36,386
Else I'll have your neck with
that false goatee. Bloody ass!

834
01:23:38,283 --> 01:23:41,938
Well, what brings you here?

835
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:44,330
We're fed up with the Prince.

836
01:23:44,409 --> 01:23:46,872
If you don't do 
something fast.. - So?

837
01:23:46,952 --> 01:23:49,715
...we'll be forced to cast
our lot with the Princess.

838
01:23:49,796 --> 01:23:51,501
We'll invite her to return to Thambor.
She is rightful ruler.

839
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:58,126
I am the ruler.

840
01:24:03,993 --> 01:24:06,263
I am the ruler!

841
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:09,582
I am the ruler!

842
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,909
Witch!

843
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:17,184
Witch!

844
01:24:18,931 --> 01:24:22,647
Of what use this impotent 
magic of yours?!

845
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:27,449
Can't you find out where
the Princess is hiding?

846
01:24:27,793 --> 01:24:31,689
What's the matter Durjan?
You've lost colour!

847
01:24:31,902 --> 01:24:33,440
Take your hands off me!

848
01:24:38,277 --> 01:24:40,609
Do you want to 
sample my powers?

849
01:24:41,096 --> 01:24:42,596
Here goes!

850
01:24:46,595 --> 01:24:50,549
I didn't mean it, Witch.
It's just that I am a bit uptight.

851
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:53,625
I might have crossed the limits.
But, please don't be angry with me.

852
01:24:54,765 --> 01:24:58,030
Forgiven you, sweetheart.

853
01:24:58,109 --> 01:25:04,246
On the following night of
no-moon, your woes come to an end.

854
01:25:04,326 --> 01:25:11,823
On your birthday, the Prince will
be brought before you in chains.

855
01:25:11,903 --> 01:25:14,411
What about the Princess?

856
01:25:14,492 --> 01:25:19,056
The woman will follow the man.

857
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:22,927
The Princess will 
follow the Prince.

858
01:26:17,777 --> 01:26:27,587
"I am pinning, and 
you are desperate."

859
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:30,420
"So what do we do?"

860
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,283
"Let's make love."

861
01:26:32,363 --> 01:26:37,534
"The heart's wish 
is God's wish."

862
01:26:38,202 --> 01:26:47,898
"I am pinning, and 
you are desperate."

863
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,659
"So what do we do?"

864
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:52,543
"Let's make love."

865
01:26:52,623 --> 01:26:58,051
"Why wait for what 
the world wishes."

866
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:00,897
"Let's make love."

867
01:27:00,976 --> 01:27:03,434
"Let's make love."

868
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:05,921
"Let's make love."

869
01:27:06,001 --> 01:27:09,067
"Let's make love."

870
01:27:49,113 --> 01:27:52,904
"I am pinning.."

871
01:27:54,162 --> 01:27:57,689
"Why should we come 
back to our senses."

872
01:27:59,229 --> 01:28:04,322
"Let us be lost in 
our enchanting world."

873
01:28:04,403 --> 01:28:06,831
"Let our eyes talks."

874
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:10,077
"But let out lips 
remain silent."

875
01:28:11,238 --> 01:28:13,437
"It's the season of 
making promises."

876
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:16,667
"Let us also make 
a few promises."

877
01:28:17,037 --> 01:28:19,443
"Let's make love.."

878
01:28:19,523 --> 01:28:21,936
"Let's make love.."

879
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:24,577
"Let's make love.."

880
01:28:24,657 --> 01:28:27,322
"Let's make love.."

881
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:13,779
"Your name and my name."

882
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:18,639
"We are two names, 
but one soul."

883
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:22,915
"Your name and my name."

884
01:29:22,994 --> 01:29:25,600
"We are two names, 
but one soul."

885
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,966
"Whatever anyone may say."

886
01:29:28,046 --> 01:29:31,283
"But love is not easy."

887
01:29:32,287 --> 01:29:37,855
"If love is a sea of fire,
let us swim across it."

888
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,425
"Let's make love.."

889
01:29:40,627 --> 01:29:43,027
"Let's make love.."

890
01:29:43,108 --> 01:29:45,569
"Let's make love.."

891
01:29:45,649 --> 01:29:48,152
"Let's make love.."

892
01:29:48,232 --> 01:29:53,018
"I am pinning, and 
you are desperate."

893
01:29:53,266 --> 01:29:55,677
"So what do we do?"

894
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:57,549
"Let's make love.."

895
01:29:57,628 --> 01:30:03,041
"Why wait for what 
the world wishes."

896
01:30:16,032 --> 01:30:17,217
Prince!

897
01:30:24,623 --> 01:30:26,580
Do you see this 
mausoleum, Prince?

898
01:30:27,543 --> 01:30:29,734
Can you tell me why it is so
dark though this torch burns here?

899
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:32,514
The fires of hatred 
kindle no light.

900
01:30:32,973 --> 01:30:34,406
The lamp of justice 
lead the light.

901
01:30:34,485 --> 01:30:37,458
Are you so blinded by love?

902
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:40,739
And the justice that I deliver
is not just enough for you!

903
01:30:40,819 --> 01:30:43,256
What you seek is vengeance
in the guise of justice.

904
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:46,485
But I cannot bear to see
your name tainted by injustice.

905
01:30:47,031 --> 01:30:52,689
I cannot sacrifice you
for fulfilling my promise.

906
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:57,535
But in the least, I 
can take my own life.

907
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:03,900
Why must you punish yourself
for the crimes of someone else?

908
01:31:10,524 --> 01:31:17,485
This I swear by my love for him.
Till you have been avenged..

909
01:31:18,836 --> 01:31:23,707
...I shall neither meet nor
shall I speak to the Prince.

910
01:31:25,573 --> 01:31:30,352
I shall live here a slave,
as you have decreed.

911
01:31:32,436 --> 01:31:39,238
If that not be enough for you,
I'm even willing to give my life.

912
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,649
"Oh, Lord."

913
01:32:22,942 --> 01:32:25,098
"Oh, Lord."

914
01:32:25,537 --> 01:32:30,491
"Everything is a 
creation of God."

915
01:32:30,572 --> 01:32:35,471
"Everything is a 
creation of God."

916
01:32:35,551 --> 01:32:40,242
"The sun shines equally for
everyone, whether good or bad."

917
01:32:40,323 --> 01:32:44,686
"Oh, Lord."

918
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:48,455
"For your sake, I 
endured every injustice."

919
01:32:48,536 --> 01:32:52,125
"No matter what happens, 
I am with you."

920
01:32:52,205 --> 01:32:55,925
"I suffered in solitude."

921
01:32:56,006 --> 01:33:00,473
"But yet my heart 
chants your name."

922
01:33:00,552 --> 01:33:05,434
"Love makes one so helpless."

923
01:33:05,515 --> 01:33:10,196
"One can't express 
his feelings."

924
01:33:10,275 --> 01:33:15,086
"Oh, Lord."

925
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:20,179
"Oh, Lord."

926
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:23,503
"Oh, Lord."

927
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:27,498
- Prince! 
- What happened, Nandu?

928
01:33:27,657 --> 01:33:31,074
- My mother.. 
- What happened to her?

929
01:33:31,154 --> 01:33:35,314
She had gone to the temple,
and hasn't returned yet.

930
01:33:35,394 --> 01:33:37,074
I am very afraid.

931
01:33:38,595 --> 01:33:40,148
Come with me.

932
01:34:54,956 --> 01:35:00,368
The lion has been trapped.
Now we can let go of the bait.

933
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:03,515
Forgive me, Prince.

934
01:35:04,475 --> 01:35:06,194
They would have killed my mother 
if I didn't do their bidding.

935
01:35:06,274 --> 01:35:07,360
Had they killed me..

936
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,965
...I would've been martyred
for the cause of Aravalli.

937
01:35:20,055 --> 01:35:22,167
You have got what you wanted.

938
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:24,357
Now you should set 
the woman free.

939
01:35:24,436 --> 01:35:27,297
Set her free I shall.
But, not for your sake.

940
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:31,194
Sake for Princess..

941
01:35:32,529 --> 01:35:39,287
She told Ranima 
and she is coming.

942
01:35:40,832 --> 01:35:42,147
Free woman.

943
01:35:44,659 --> 01:35:48,385
The Princess will remain a dream
you could seek for many lifetimes.

944
01:35:48,465 --> 01:35:50,126
In reality, she is mine.

945
01:35:50,206 --> 01:35:54,614
I have kissed her and 
held her in embrace.

946
01:35:55,247 --> 01:35:59,636
Look at me in the eye.
And you will find her.

947
01:36:00,974 --> 01:36:03,174
Don't force my hand, Prince.

948
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:06,692
I could kill you 
right here and now.

949
01:36:06,772 --> 01:36:10,726
I'm the first out of
Aravalli; not the last one.

950
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:14,835
Kill me and a thousand more soldiers
like me will stand up against you.

951
01:36:15,126 --> 01:36:17,471
I shall have you 
impaled in public.

952
01:36:18,498 --> 01:36:21,447
Every citizen of 
Aravalli will see ..

953
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:26,116
...the last drops 
of your blood drip.

954
01:36:26,196 --> 01:36:29,198
And the soil drenched
by the blood of martyrs ..

955
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:32,591
...will yield arms, not crops.

956
01:36:33,156 --> 01:36:35,435
And water in the rivers 
will turn to acid.

957
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,432
And flowers will turn fiery.

958
01:36:39,397 --> 01:36:44,275
My blood will turn the soil
of Aravalli into gunpowder.

959
01:36:44,514 --> 01:36:47,984
And Thambor will be vanquished.
So will you be!

960
01:36:50,126 --> 01:36:53,436
Nice poetry, Prince.
But, it is not the reality.

961
01:36:54,138 --> 01:36:56,283
The reality is that 
Aravalli parades ..

962
01:36:56,363 --> 01:36:59,284
...a band of robbers 
for its militia.

963
01:37:00,127 --> 01:37:04,183
With a fool of a Prince to boot.

964
01:37:05,283 --> 01:37:09,409
The idiot that you are,
you intend to put your life ..

965
01:37:09,612 --> 01:37:13,219
...and country at stake for
the sake of a mere woman.

966
01:37:13,299 --> 01:37:15,604
There's none who 
may be discarded ..

967
01:37:15,998 --> 01:37:18,196
...as easily amongst 
those in Aravalli.

968
01:37:18,612 --> 01:37:21,902
Every mother in Aravalli is 
the Queen. And every son, a Prince.

969
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,395
Past tense.

970
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:26,819
As of now, it is I who reigns
over Aravalli and Thambor.

971
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:32,431
You might rule the lands. But, I 
rule the heart of the Princess.

972
01:37:32,836 --> 01:37:35,449
You might rule the whole wide world.

973
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:38,436
But not the Princess' heart.

974
01:37:39,497 --> 01:37:45,235
You must live with that
bitter truth till the day you die.

975
01:37:45,876 --> 01:37:48,471
- Behead him! 
- No brother! Don't do it!

976
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:51,138
I mean.. Grand Vizier! And, what 
are you about to do, Sire?!

977
01:37:52,363 --> 01:37:54,412
What use giving 
him an easy death?

978
01:37:54,492 --> 01:37:57,482
Your birthday celebrations
come up tomorrow.

979
01:37:58,345 --> 01:38:07,188
You could make a grand show
out of his execution tomorrow.

980
01:38:08,113 --> 01:38:09,415
Bring him along.

981
01:38:17,114 --> 01:38:21,327
The Grand Vizier of Khambor
has captured our Prince.

982
01:38:21,408 --> 01:38:24,188
Tomorrow, the Prince is
to be executed in public.

983
01:38:36,415 --> 01:38:40,980
Seductress! You have ultimately
succeeded with your conspiracy.

984
01:38:41,314 --> 01:38:42,650
My conspiracy?

985
01:38:42,662 --> 01:38:45,696
Oh yes.
That's why you came here.

986
01:38:46,152 --> 01:38:48,872
You've always wanted to
raze Aravalli to the ground.

987
01:38:48,952 --> 01:38:53,360
Enough! Must you hate me so?!

988
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:56,016
Must you make me hate myself?

989
01:38:57,632 --> 01:39:00,233
I shall bring the 
Prince back alive.

990
01:39:00,313 --> 01:39:01,640
Well planned!

991
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,306
So you already have an
excuse to give us the slip!

992
01:39:04,604 --> 01:39:13,214
I'd even stand being scoffed at
for the sake of the Prince's life.

993
01:39:17,627 --> 01:39:21,652
Stop right there! A step 
further, and you'll be maimed.

994
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:25,503
I am bound by honour
to protect the Princess.

995
01:39:30,156 --> 01:39:34,171
Anyone who dares to challenge
my honour will be vanquished.

996
01:39:41,577 --> 01:39:43,844
Loyalty runs in my 
veins, Your Majesty.

997
01:39:44,482 --> 01:39:48,086
Please pray that I 
may bring the Prince..

998
01:39:48,403 --> 01:39:50,866
...home safely, even if
it might cost me my life.

999
01:39:55,237 --> 01:39:58,324
Watch the show, 
people of Thambor.

1000
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:03,621
You're going to witness
a thrilling fight between..

1001
01:40:03,701 --> 01:40:07,256
...the Prince of Aravalli
and the cannibal Hakoba.

1002
01:40:09,341 --> 01:40:11,205
Let the contest commence.

1003
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:24,330
What means this 
impudent interruption?

1004
01:40:24,409 --> 01:40:26,501
This is no impudence 
Your Majesty.

1005
01:40:26,668 --> 01:40:28,746
I bring you the best 
carpet from Persia.

1006
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:31,729
A unique gift on your birthday.

1007
01:40:32,257 --> 01:40:35,828
However, if blood is spilled,
you will not be able to witness..

1008
01:40:35,908 --> 01:40:38,889
...the magic of the carpet. 
- What magic?

1009
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:45,859
Whatever you may desire.
All you have to do is ask the carpet.

1010
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:49,616
What if your claim 
turns out to be false?

1011
01:40:49,697 --> 01:40:53,302
Then, you may send 
me to the cannibal ..

1012
01:40:53,382 --> 01:40:54,974
...before you send the Prince.

1013
01:40:55,055 --> 01:40:56,268
Granted.

1014
01:41:05,787 --> 01:41:07,090
Now kiss the carpet ..

1015
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:09,886
...whilst you think of
the object of your desire.

1016
01:41:11,059 --> 01:41:12,326
Why must I do that?

1017
01:41:12,338 --> 01:41:14,347
For that will change you fate.

1018
01:41:34,979 --> 01:41:35,934
Bloody dirt!

1019
01:41:35,946 --> 01:41:38,157
Do not abuse the Earth, Sire.

1020
01:41:38,729 --> 01:41:41,648
For it is the Earth 
on which you live.

1021
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:45,326
Now, sit back while 
your wish is fulfilled.

1022
01:43:31,358 --> 01:43:39,299
"In my eyes."

1023
01:43:39,378 --> 01:43:42,528
"I have several 
secrets in my heart."

1024
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:50,478
"I crossed the ocean of love."

1025
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:53,430
"In my eyes."

1026
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:55,392
"In my eyes"

1027
01:43:55,473 --> 01:43:58,455
"I have several 
secrets in my heart."

1028
01:43:59,282 --> 01:44:02,756
"I crossed the ocean of love."

1029
01:44:03,205 --> 01:44:06,957
"I crossed the ocean of love."

1030
01:45:05,622 --> 01:45:06,736
Go.

1031
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:34,998
"My youth has put 
me into trouble."

1032
01:45:38,116 --> 01:45:43,198
"My youth has put 
me into trouble."

1033
01:45:44,315 --> 01:45:49,497
"And I am in love."

1034
01:45:50,475 --> 01:45:56,897
"Several desires .."

1035
01:45:56,976 --> 01:46:01,586
".. in my heart."

1036
01:46:02,474 --> 01:46:09,882
"I crossed the ocean of love."

1037
01:47:22,363 --> 01:47:24,510
"Don't let your heart waver."

1038
01:47:26,421 --> 01:47:28,489
"Don't lose courage."

1039
01:47:30,449 --> 01:47:32,341
"Don't let your heart waver."

1040
01:47:32,421 --> 01:47:34,434
"Don't lose courage."

1041
01:47:34,515 --> 01:47:38,634
"Don't reveal the secret."

1042
01:47:40,623 --> 01:47:46,474
"Which is hidden .."

1043
01:47:46,662 --> 01:47:51,793
".. in this heart."

1044
01:47:52,402 --> 01:47:59,969
"I crossed the ocean of love."

1045
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:04,726
"In my eyes."

1046
01:48:04,806 --> 01:48:07,850
"I have several 
secrets in my heart."

1047
01:48:08,555 --> 01:48:12,152
"I crossed the ocean of love."

1048
01:48:12,576 --> 01:48:16,965
"I crossed the ocean of love."

1049
01:50:06,174 --> 01:50:09,759
Kill him!

1050
01:50:10,001 --> 01:50:14,288
Kill him!

1051
01:55:07,724 --> 01:55:09,326
Command me, Master.

1052
01:55:17,362 --> 01:55:21,444
Kill anyone who dares 
to come in our way.

1053
01:55:58,327 --> 01:56:01,732
Victory to the Prince!

1054
01:56:02,082 --> 01:56:06,955
Victory to the Prince!

1055
01:56:07,265 --> 01:56:11,165
Victory to the Prince!

1056
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:18,864
Victory to the Prince!

1057
01:56:18,944 --> 01:56:22,902
Victory to the Prince!

1058
01:56:28,335 --> 01:56:31,965
By the grace of your blessings, I
have been able to keep my word.

1059
01:56:42,349 --> 01:56:48,661
The Prince has not
yet fulfilled his promise.

1060
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:19,913
Here's the criminal.
He's yours to immolate or impale.

1061
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:26,881
Honourable professor of geography!
Why do you want to impale me?!

1062
01:57:26,961 --> 01:57:29,927
Why must you impale me?!
I'm not the brother, you see!

1063
01:57:30,269 --> 01:57:34,030
You've mistaken me 
for my brother.

1064
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:34,890
Your brother!

1065
01:57:34,902 --> 01:57:36,408
That's exactly
what I'm trying..

1066
01:57:36,488 --> 01:57:37,749
...to tell you, revered
professor of geography!

1067
01:57:37,828 --> 01:57:41,147
I'm not what my brother is!
I am me! Not the brother!

1068
01:57:41,324 --> 01:57:43,724
Potluck has been it for
me ever since I was a child.

1069
01:57:44,168 --> 01:57:47,546
He does all the mischief!
And I get all the blame.

1070
01:57:47,792 --> 01:57:49,612
It's all my brother's fault.

1071
01:57:49,693 --> 01:57:52,181
I, a poor innocent am 
at the receiving end.

1072
01:57:52,261 --> 01:57:55,965
- He lies! 
- No! I'm not lying!

1073
01:57:56,045 --> 01:58:00,479
It's a sin to lie! 
And I know that!

1074
01:58:01,733 --> 01:58:05,915
Prince! Prince! 
No.. Not you.. The Queen!

1075
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:11,650
Can you not recognise 
me, Your Majesty?

1076
01:58:12,528 --> 01:58:14,455
How am I to convince you
that I'm not the Grand Vizier?!

1077
01:58:14,534 --> 01:58:16,380
I'm not the Grand Vizier! 
I'm Sujan Singh.

1078
01:58:16,689 --> 01:58:18,132
I'm not the Grand Vizier.

1079
01:58:18,712 --> 01:58:23,980
This is all a conspiracy
hatched by my brother.

1080
01:58:24,976 --> 01:58:30,071
It's his conspiracy. He was very
clever even since he was a child.

1081
01:58:30,978 --> 01:58:34,452
He wanted the Princess
as well as the Kingdom.

1082
01:58:34,751 --> 01:58:39,203
He killed the King 
of Thambor himself.

1083
01:58:39,639 --> 01:58:42,092
And he put the blame 
on your husband.

1084
01:58:42,171 --> 01:58:47,844
And this witch sentenced my
husband to death with a thought!

1085
01:58:48,263 --> 01:58:53,848
Please don't blame the Princess 
for that. She isn't at fault.

1086
01:58:54,202 --> 01:58:58,427
The poor girl fell in a swoon
when she saw her slain father.

1087
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:02,734
And do you know what
my brother did afterwards?

1088
01:59:03,036 --> 01:59:05,698
He's really a scoundrel 
of the first order!

1089
01:59:06,051 --> 01:59:08,567
He took advantage of her
senselessness and mixed..

1090
01:59:08,647 --> 01:59:10,608
...some magical 
powder in her medicine.

1091
01:59:10,688 --> 01:59:13,635
The witch had concocted it.

1092
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:20,391
It made her lose the powers
to reason for a few days.

1093
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:26,719
It's the truth, Your Majesty.
And I'm completely innocent.

1094
01:59:26,799 --> 01:59:30,823
Please be just to me! 
How am I to blame?!

1095
01:59:31,033 --> 01:59:34,536
Is it just because I am
that scoundrel's brother?

1096
01:59:37,657 --> 01:59:39,328
Nanny! - Panna!

1097
01:59:56,573 --> 01:59:59,934
Panna! Panna!

1098
02:00:00,014 --> 02:00:01,315
I beg your forgiveness, 
Your Majesty.

1099
02:00:01,711 --> 02:00:03,724
It is I who should 
beg your pardon.

1100
02:00:05,259 --> 02:00:07,309
Allow me your leave, 
then. - No, Panna.

1101
02:00:09,403 --> 02:00:11,364
Forces! Attack!

1102
02:00:37,077 --> 02:00:38,717
- So you are Durjan! 
- Yes I am.

1103
02:00:39,323 --> 02:00:43,452
But you've recognised 
me a bit too late.

1104
02:01:13,479 --> 02:01:14,997
Panna..

1105
02:01:18,214 --> 02:01:19,676
Mother..

1106
02:01:20,403 --> 02:01:23,382
- Please save my child! - Help!

1107
02:01:23,461 --> 02:01:27,956
Stop, soldiers. 
The Princess is coming with me.

1108
02:01:28,217 --> 02:01:30,006
- No! - Come along, Princess!

1109
02:01:30,309 --> 02:01:31,819
- No! - Oh, come along.

1110
02:01:31,899 --> 02:01:33,438
Hey fellows! I can take 
her only if you let go.

1111
02:01:33,518 --> 02:01:35,609
Let go of her! Fools!
As for you, Princess..

1112
02:01:35,844 --> 02:01:38,011
You're likely to be
hurt on the battlefield.

1113
02:01:38,091 --> 02:01:39,379
So come along with me.

1114
02:01:39,741 --> 02:01:41,492
Prince!

1115
02:01:42,389 --> 02:01:44,949
Please save my child!

1116
02:01:45,564 --> 02:01:47,211
Help! Mother!

1117
02:02:13,082 --> 02:02:14,322
Prince!

1118
02:03:32,862 --> 02:03:34,779
Behold the view, Princess.

1119
02:03:35,492 --> 02:03:37,420
Seldom is seen anything 
as enthralling..

1120
02:03:37,501 --> 02:03:39,341
...from the ramparts of 
your castle. Tell me..

1121
02:03:39,421 --> 02:03:40,692
...how best would you
like your hands coloured?

1122
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:45,178
Do you want the stain of
royal blood on your hands?

1123
02:03:46,643 --> 02:03:49,822
Or would you rather anoint
your hands the colour of henna..

1124
02:03:50,351 --> 02:03:52,440
...for your marriage to me?

1125
02:03:53,184 --> 02:03:55,833
My daughter-in-law 
cannot be compelled.

1126
02:03:56,197 --> 02:04:00,618
She might be inveigled by you.
But she can't be coerced.

1127
02:04:01,674 --> 02:04:03,116
Your Majesty!

1128
02:04:04,636 --> 02:04:07,082
Address me now as your mother.

1129
02:04:07,845 --> 02:04:11,366
- Mother! 
- Don't worry about our safety.

1130
02:04:12,123 --> 02:04:16,610
I have lived my 
life and I died ..

1131
02:04:17,604 --> 02:04:23,111
...when I saw my 
husband die here.

1132
02:04:26,509 --> 02:04:30,529
And I have lived 
after I had died.

1133
02:04:30,609 --> 02:04:33,697
I have hurt you 
much, unknowingly.

1134
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:39,934
I do not want to disgrace
you by begging your pardon.

1135
02:04:41,833 --> 02:04:45,768
Panna had told me that you
are what the Prince lives for.

1136
02:04:46,998 --> 02:04:51,846
For the sake of the Prince, 
I seek that you live.

1137
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:57,253
The Prince! The poor 
Prince is dead and gone.

1138
02:04:57,729 --> 02:04:59,533
The lowly liar!

1139
02:05:01,225 --> 02:05:02,378
He is the Angel 
of Death for you.

1140
02:05:02,458 --> 02:05:03,848
And he should be 
coming any moment.

1141
02:05:03,927 --> 02:05:06,425
No. He won't come ever again.

1142
02:05:07,165 --> 02:05:10,059
Here's the proof of his death.

1143
02:05:24,024 --> 02:05:27,139
Now tell me, Princess, 
what you'd prefer.

1144
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:34,634
Do you want them to die?
Or, will you marry me?

1145
02:05:53,130 --> 02:06:00,929
"Don't be so impatient .."

1146
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:08,659
".. to celebrate 
the victory of love."

1147
02:06:09,444 --> 02:06:15,107
"There's many a slip .."

1148
02:06:15,756 --> 02:06:21,290
".. between the 
cup and the lip."

1149
02:06:22,323 --> 02:06:25,731
"Come .."

1150
02:06:27,854 --> 02:06:33,631
"Come, my heart beckons you."

1151
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:38,860
"Come, my heart beckons you."

1152
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:44,550
"O my Prince."

1153
02:06:44,631 --> 02:06:50,892
"O my Prince."

1154
02:06:51,551 --> 02:06:57,470
"I hope this world does
not defeat our love"

1155
02:06:57,550 --> 02:07:02,591
"I hope this world does
not defeat our love."

1156
02:07:02,671 --> 02:07:08,578
"O My Prince."

1157
02:07:08,658 --> 02:07:15,612
"O My Prince."

1158
02:07:33,108 --> 02:07:38,177
"Today is the battle 
of love and fate."

1159
02:07:39,184 --> 02:07:43,946
"The world has 
become our enemy."

1160
02:07:45,167 --> 02:07:50,314
"Today is the battle 
of love and fate."

1161
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:56,328
"The world has 
become our enemy."

1162
02:07:56,841 --> 02:08:01,971
"Come."

1163
02:08:03,274 --> 02:08:09,360
"Break these barriers."

1164
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:14,475
"Break these barriers."

1165
02:08:15,029 --> 02:08:20,532
"O my Prince."

1166
02:08:20,613 --> 02:08:27,603
"O my Prince."

1167
02:09:15,135 --> 02:09:24,118
"Come, O Saviour."

1168
02:09:24,198 --> 02:09:33,211
"Come, O Saviour."

1169
02:09:33,291 --> 02:09:37,654
""Someone's dying 
here thinking of you.""

1170
02:09:37,733 --> 02:09:42,052
"Come, O Saviour."

1171
02:09:42,132 --> 02:09:46,908
"Come, O Saviour."

1172
02:09:55,573 --> 02:09:59,964
"Come, O Saviour."

1173
02:10:00,045 --> 02:10:04,672
"Come, O Saviour."

1174
02:10:04,751 --> 02:10:08,875
"Come, O Saviour."

1175
02:10:08,956 --> 02:10:13,891
"Come, O Saviour."

1176
02:10:22,979 --> 02:10:31,635
"The ones in 
trouble await you."

1177
02:10:31,715 --> 02:10:35,630
"Trusting your love .."

1178
02:10:36,237 --> 02:10:39,598
".. even she awaits you."

1179
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:43,987
"Trusting your love .."

1180
02:10:45,034 --> 02:10:48,220
".. even she awaits you."

1181
02:10:49,108 --> 02:10:51,930
"How did this 
calamity befall them .."

1182
02:10:53,515 --> 02:10:57,871
".. in this season of love."

1183
02:10:57,951 --> 02:11:03,877
"Come, O Saviour."

1184
02:11:03,957 --> 02:11:08,482
"Come, O Saviour."

1185
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:29,864
"Come and hold my 
hand, I beg of you."

1186
02:11:29,944 --> 02:11:34,149
"Come and hold my 
hand, I beg of you."

1187
02:11:34,229 --> 02:11:38,544
"Come and hold my 
hand, I beg of you."

1188
02:11:38,625 --> 02:11:42,957
"Come and hold my 
hand, I beg of you."

1189
02:11:43,037 --> 02:11:51,601
"Come and hold my 
hand, I beg of you."

1190
02:11:51,680 --> 02:12:00,183
"Come, O Saviour."

1191
02:12:00,264 --> 02:12:04,534
"The ones in 
trouble await you."

1192
02:12:04,613 --> 02:12:08,764
"Come, O Saviour."

1193
02:12:08,845 --> 02:12:13,190
"Come, O Saviour."

1194
02:12:38,729 --> 02:12:43,000
"This is love."

1195
02:12:43,081 --> 02:12:47,333
"This is love."

1196
02:12:47,729 --> 02:12:52,372
"This world can't destroy it."

1197
02:12:52,452 --> 02:12:56,358
"The ocean can't swallow it."

1198
02:12:56,439 --> 02:13:00,431
"The fire can't burn it."

1199
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:04,258
"The sword can't pierce it."

1200
02:13:04,339 --> 02:13:08,479
"This is love."

1201
02:13:08,559 --> 02:13:14,025
"O my Prince."

1202
02:13:14,105 --> 02:13:17,033
"O my Prince."

1203
02:13:17,113 --> 02:13:21,239
"This is love."

1204
02:13:21,319 --> 02:13:25,391
"This is love."

1205
02:13:25,471 --> 02:13:30,505
"O my Prince."

1206
02:13:30,671 --> 02:13:33,935
"O my Prince."

1207
02:13:34,015 --> 02:13:37,965
"This is love."

1208
02:13:38,046 --> 02:13:42,455
"This is love."

1209
02:13:59,707 --> 02:14:03,027
"This is love."

1210
02:14:03,107 --> 02:14:07,232
"This is love."

1211
02:14:08,279 --> 02:14:18,354
"Come my beloved."

1212
02:15:41,898 --> 02:15:45,163
- Mother! 
- Go son! Save your bride.

1213
02:15:45,550 --> 02:15:48,515
Leave me.

1214
02:15:51,078 --> 02:15:53,344
Bloody clown!
Where are you going?

1215
02:15:53,356 --> 02:15:54,833
I was just passing by!

1216
02:15:55,113 --> 02:15:56,200
Brother! Save me!

1217
02:15:56,212 --> 02:15:57,831
Stop right there, Durjan!

1218
02:15:58,805 --> 02:16:00,940
Else I'll kill your brother!

1219
02:16:00,952 --> 02:16:03,028
Go on. Kill that imbecile.

1220
02:16:03,897 --> 02:16:06,802
I care a hang whether 
he lives or dies.

1221
02:16:07,005 --> 02:16:13,971
Do you not?! Is that the way you
reward my years of loyal service?

1222
02:16:14,051 --> 02:16:15,141
Oh yes!

1223
02:16:15,659 --> 02:16:21,221
Fie on you, Durjan Singh!
You've been an unworthy brother!

1224
02:16:21,448 --> 02:16:23,589
- Listen to me, Prince! 
- Let go of me!

1225
02:16:23,863 --> 02:16:27,346
Listen to me! You can't go 
in where they're taking..

1226
02:16:27,426 --> 02:16:30,953
...the Princess away, without 
my help. - You are lying!

1227
02:16:31,033 --> 02:16:33,038
You can kill me if that's a lie!

1228
02:16:35,688 --> 02:16:37,113
Witch!

1229
02:16:41,327 --> 02:16:43,165
Shut up!

1230
02:16:43,988 --> 02:16:50,602
She refuses to marry me. And now, 
I want to marry her secretly.

1231
02:16:50,876 --> 02:16:54,404
It will by solemnized
accordance with our rites.

1232
02:16:54,484 --> 02:16:57,977
The marriage will follow
consummation of the marriage.

1233
02:16:58,709 --> 02:17:03,734
Hurry, Prince! 
We have little time.

1234
02:17:05,476 --> 02:17:07,464
This way, Prince.

1235
02:17:32,007 --> 02:17:34,930
Prince! Save the Princess!

1236
02:17:35,316 --> 02:17:36,727
I'll take care for the witch.

1237
02:17:40,904 --> 02:17:45,368
My firm determination will seek ..

1238
02:17:46,501 --> 02:17:51,808
...your beauty tonight.

1239
02:17:52,879 --> 02:17:55,878
And history will 
be written afresh.

1240
02:17:56,168 --> 02:17:57,589
Prince!

1241
02:17:57,668 --> 02:17:59,474
Whom are you calling for?

1242
02:17:59,486 --> 02:18:01,709
My love! And he will kill you.

1243
02:18:03,073 --> 02:18:04,366
Prince!

1244
02:18:05,818 --> 02:18:07,164
Prince!

1245
02:18:09,664 --> 02:18:12,347
Durjan!

1246
02:18:25,227 --> 02:18:26,441
Prince!

1247
02:20:04,074 --> 02:20:05,690
The Lord be praised!

1248
02:20:48,813 --> 02:20:49,878
No.

1249
02:20:53,263 --> 02:20:54,495
No.

1250
02:20:55,038 --> 02:20:55,948
No.

1251
02:20:56,177 --> 02:20:59,872
Bid the Prince a farewell.

1252
02:21:34,158 --> 02:21:35,439
Prince!

1253
02:21:39,854 --> 02:21:43,425
- You're alive. 
- I could've died for you.

1254
02:21:59,807 --> 02:22:02,553
Long live the Prince!

1255
02:22:02,634 --> 02:22:05,391
Long live the Prince!

1256
02:22:05,471 --> 02:22:08,367
Long live the Prince!

1257
02:22:08,447 --> 02:22:10,423
Long live the Prince!
