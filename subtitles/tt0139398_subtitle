1
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:43,146
Living beings ask their Lord..

2
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:49,151
How can I reach you?

3
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:54,156
The Lord says...

4
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:58,660
...conquer your heart

5
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:03,506
And you will find me

6
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:09,514
Your heart is a mirror

7
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,110
Your heart is a looking glass

8
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:21,117
Good and evil deeds..

9
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:25,621
It views and reflects all

10
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:29,534
Your heart is a looking glass

11
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:03,502
The heart is your God Almighty

12
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,834
None is above it

13
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:13,504
The heart is your God Almighty

14
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:17,106
None is above it

15
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:26,616
Only when the heart is
pure can goodness spread

16
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,530
Let not the immaculate being..

17
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:38,127
Let not the immaculate being..

18
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,131
...ever be tarnished

19
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:47,136
Your heart is transparent

20
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,452
The petals of joy and
the thorns of sorrow..

21
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,123
The mind creates them all

22
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:46,538
The petals of joy and
the thorns of sorrow..

23
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,132
The mind creates them all

24
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:56,138
Nothing is hidden from the soul

25
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,480
The spirit has a thousand eyes

26
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:06,089
One can escape from the world

27
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:10,426
One can escape from the world

28
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:15,090
But you can't
run away from the mind

29
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:10,747
Physical beauty is transitory

30
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,821
The treasures in the
mind are priceless

31
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:20,089
Physical beauty is transitory

32
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,501
A beautiful mind lives forever

33
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:33,103
Don't sully the mind for the body

34
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:39,515
One who does not
appreciate the mind..

35
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,113
One who does not
appreciate the mind..

36
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,617
...wastes his life

37
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,091
Your Royal Highness,
thy slave has brought you tea.

38
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,094
Do I consider you my slave?

39
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,370
It's your magnanimity if you don't.

40
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,108
How can I forget your Dad was king
and mine the clerk of this palace?

41
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:43,514
If not a slave, what will the
daughter of a clerk call herself?

42
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,607
Slave...

43
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,609
Next time you call yourself a slave..

44
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:53,793
I'll complain to mother that
you are tugging my scanty hair.

45
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,458
You'll complain about me!

46
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,527
I won't. Please drink the tea.

47
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,061
Join me for tea.

48
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:05,060
I don't have time to die.

49
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:09,564
Early morning I have to
sing for her Lord Krishna.

50
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,479
Then I have to flatter
her other son for some tea.

51
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,581
Then I go home and make
breakfast for my brother.

52
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,075
Only then am I destined
to drink half a cup of tea.

53
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,748
One little person
with millions of jobs.

54
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:26,089
I'm not scared of anyone.
It is the absolute truth!

55
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,427
Should I give Bhola
the box of nasal spray?

56
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,562
And ask him to get another similar one

57
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,093
No, return it and get the
one Nathu had given earlier.

58
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,103
Mother, she's so mischievous.

59
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,098
She's the life of our home.

60
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,841
The soul of our castle.

61
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:47,777
May you live long.

62
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:52,778
Lord Hanuman, son of the Wind God..

63
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,518
My dear God...

64
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:56,611
Help me.

65
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,782
Whether a cough or jaundice...

66
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:03,493
Or a basic fever..

67
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:06,554
Let me contract anything
but avoid getting married.

68
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:11,730
I am a confirmed bachelor
Let me children be bachelors.

69
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:19,076
Don't let the shadow of a
woman fall on thy disciple.

70
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:23,073
I am very...what do you
call it, with women.

71
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,074
Do you understand?

72
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,478
Just as you are worshipped
as Hanuman, the devotee of Ram..

73
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,681
Similarly I want to be
addressed as Bhola, your devotee.

74
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,755
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

75
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,587
Confirmed bachelor...

76
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,431
Sister!

77
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:46,502
Strange are the ways of fate.
The Queen mother has plans for you.

78
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,767
What is she thinking of?

79
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:53,101
I heard her say, if Bhola
doesn't get married soon..

80
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,111
He will have to be relieved.

81
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:59,107
According to her, when
men sprout beards..

82
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:01,052
They should immediately get married.

83
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:04,318
Good God, I am finished!
But you...

84
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:07,458
Thank the good god, neither
will I sprout facial hair..

85
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,052
Nor will the queen mother
threaten me to get married.

86
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,497
Coming!

87
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,069
I am coming. Hold on!

88
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:19,061
Change this and get
the earlier sample.

89
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:26,068
Dear God, why didn't
you make me hairless?

90
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,073
This beard is
getting me in trouble.

91
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:32,076
No problem, I'll clear it now.

92
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,544
Only then will I go
near the Queen Mother.

93
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,755
I am coming. Why
are you honking away?

94
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:44,688
I've been honking for hours.
Here are the keys.

95
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:48,090
- The Prince must be waiting.
- But where are you going?

96
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,093
Stay home in peace
at least on Sundays.

97
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:53,095
Some days you have a college
match, other days, it's a picnic.

98
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,098
And now a new craze, boating.

99
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:58,102
That's why we're going
to meet Mr. Saxena.

100
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,102
It's very urgent.
I'm the team captain.

101
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:05,607
He will fall in love
with the captain's face.

102
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,553
And if he has a daughter,
he'll give her to you as reward.

103
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,453
Obviously.

104
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,115
Taken a look at yourself?
Look at the state you're in.

105
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:15,594
I don't care. Come home.

106
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,460
Please, sweet sister...

107
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,122
Give me an hour.
I'll be back in a flash.

108
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:26,536
If you don't return, I'll
go to the castle and fast.

109
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,540
- I'll be back soon.
- Come fast.

110
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,150
Your Highness, let's go.

111
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,109
We'll have to get water.

112
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,112
- I'd checked but..
- I'll get it.

113
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,523
Here's the can.

114
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,617
I'll have to change the tyre too.

115
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,121
Get water while I change
the tyre and hurry back.

116
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,120
The beautiful form..

117
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,530
These arms..

118
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:40,132
...and the waist might
be seen by somebody

119
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:50,139
I fear somebody might watch me

120
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,550
Near the spring..

121
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:03,094
Somebody might take a
picture of my figure

122
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:10,099
Bent low over the branches..

123
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,767
A flower might look my way

124
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:28,453
My heart is beating

125
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:33,718
My breath is caught in my throat

126
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:42,125
Some pesky person might
witness the effect of my beauty

127
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,481
Your book!

128
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,426
Miss Bhanu Saxena.

129
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,092
She is in search of a husband.

130
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,766
Hear some more methods
of controlling a husband.

131
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:24,770
Number 1 = rein for a
horse, collar for a dog...

132
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,601
And a nose ring for a camel.

133
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:30,105
The shackles needed
to bond a man are...

134
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,108
....the mannerisms of a woman.

135
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:39,615
There isn't much of a difference
between husbands and pet dogs.

136
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:43,523
When a man growls in anger
at something his wife does..

137
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,124
Immediately caress him with love.

138
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:53,128
This woman must have
ruined innumerable families.

139
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,574
I don't know about the author..

140
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:59,543
But the reader stole my heart..

141
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,579
Let me see what's wrong.

142
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,744
It's actually beating fast..

143
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,506
This book...is probably yours.

144
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,105
Who is it?

145
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,704
Your Highness! Please come in.

146
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,107
I am indeed blessed
that you came to my home.

147
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:41,110
I thought you'd forgotten me.

148
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:43,612
How is that possible?
I could never forget you.

149
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,460
For many days, I've been
planning to visit the palace.

150
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,860
But my work doesn't give me time.

151
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,795
Since I've taken the contract
of the Ramban forests..

152
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,626
I have no peace.

153
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,571
And who might you be?

154
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:03,075
He is Mr. Kaushal, my best friend.

155
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,067
He's a great player.
Wins some cup every year.

156
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,479
He could prove useful.

157
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,081
Why didn't you introduce us earlier?

158
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,483
And who is she?

159
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:20,081
She's my daughter, studying in
Delhi. She's appeared for BA.

160
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,083
She's come here for the vacation.

161
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,427
To rest for a few days.

162
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,590
This is His Royal Highness.

163
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:34,095
He owns the palace
I showed you the other day

164
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,600
Is the Queen Mother well?

165
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,602
Yes, very well.

166
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,445
Pay her my respects.

167
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,108
Someday I'll take you to meet her.

168
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,712
You'll take me?

169
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:55,855
Your Highness, my daughter
cribs that I don't take her out.

170
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:59,125
She has to spend time all by herself.

171
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:04,068
But sir, far from the madding
crowd, in the lap of nature..

172
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,060
How can one feel lonely?

173
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,062
Yes, how can he?

174
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,408
Take yesterday, our servant...

175
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,675
You're reminding me to
ask them what they would like.

176
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,075
There's no formality.
They will have tea.

177
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,750
Get some tea.

178
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:23,578
So what was I saying...?

179
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,489
Go on.

180
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,089
I've come for something important.

181
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,087
What can I do for you?

182
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,694
You will have to be the
judge for our next boat race.

183
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,095
But..I'm going on a tour tomorrow.

184
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,503
The race is not tomorrow
but on the 15th of next month.

185
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,102
Still let me check my dairy.

186
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,581
I might have an engagement.

187
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:51,111
That's my book.

188
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,711
Let me check.

189
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,059
- Is the tea ready?
- Yes.

190
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:05,053
No. Let me take it.

191
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,064
all right. I'm free on the 15th.

192
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,410
Oh this. Bhanu won it.

193
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,578
Her college gave it to her when
she won the dance competition.

194
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,745
Then you must have
read Allarakhi's book.

195
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,082
Who is Allarakhi?

196
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,080
Sir, don't you know?

197
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,089
She's a famous writer.

198
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,424
She's written many
bestsellers on dances.

199
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:39,087
Then she must have read it.
Right, dear?

200
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:44,092
Yes...I mean..no.

201
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:56,445
This is probably your book.

202
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:00,711
- I..
- This is my daughter Bhanu.

203
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,053
How can I forget you?

204
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,055
Bhanu won this at a dance competition

205
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,063
You must have read Allarakhi's book.

206
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:24,065
Yes..I mean...no.

207
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:45,086
Your body drenched..

208
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,093
...radiates a fire

209
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,439
It warms my heart

210
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:05,107
Rouses emotions in my heart

211
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:14,125
Anyone coming close to you...

212
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,789
...will melt

213
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:27,133
Anyone coming close
to you will melt

214
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:36,138
Anyone who messes with these
embers will burn his fingers

215
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:46,148
Anyone coming close
to you will melt away

216
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:06,100
Your beauty is the dew
drop that grew among flames

217
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:16,111
Warm fragrances melting
into a rainbow of colours

218
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:25,552
Your beauty is the dew
drop that grew among flames

219
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,467
Warm fragrances..

220
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,133
..melting into a rainbow of colours

221
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:44,810
Who has the heart to be
able to control his heart?

222
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:13,603
Your lips are the result
of a poet's imagination

223
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:23,847
Your tresses are the
dreams of a dreamer

224
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:33,130
Your lips are the result
of a poet's imagination

225
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:43,132
Your tresses are the
dreams of a dreamer

226
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:52,140
Anyone exposed to such
dreams will lose his heart

227
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:23,105
Never has anyone heard or
seen such beauty in one being

228
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:32,114
Fortunate is the one you
choose to share your confidences

229
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:41,623
Never has anyone heard or
seen such beauty in one being

230
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:50,803
Fortunate is the one you
choose to share your confidences

231
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:59,150
The course of his
destiny will change

232
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,618
Queen Mother! I was
coming to see you.

233
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,462
I exchanged the snuff
box from the grocer's.

234
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,124
But what happened to your beard?

235
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:55,629
Sister said you'd get me
married because of the hair.

236
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:58,632
So I got it shaved off.

237
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:00,139
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

238
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,741
Do you know who a bachelor is?

239
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,073
A confirmed bachelor is
a devotee of Lord Hanuman.

240
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,076
Who exercises and prays daily.

241
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:10,752
Like my father did.

242
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,489
You won't understand the
glory of bachelorhood.

243
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:17,084
True knowledge, control and
hard penance are required for it.

244
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,755
You will always remain
the fool that you are!

245
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:26,502
Control...knowledge...

246
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,115
Sir, what did you say?

247
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:46,113
- Who is Kamin?
- Come in.

248
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,121
Command me.

249
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:58,125
What will I do with this?

250
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:01,071
Give it to Miss Bhanu.

251
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:03,666
- How would I know..
- Softly!

252
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,068
How would I know
who Miss Bhanu is...

253
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,070
Miss Bhanu is Saxena's daughter.

254
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:12,073
Give me some sign.

255
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,747
She is fair, has dark hair.

256
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:18,420
- She's tall and has huge eyes..
- Good God!

257
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,082
- Softly.
- Okay.

258
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:24,494
You'll get me in trouble.

259
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:47,779
Hey buffalo! Don't you see
where you're standing?

260
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:50,713
I'm standing on earth.

261
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:53,523
Do you have eyes or candy?

262
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,534
What did you say?

263
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:06,060
- I said, it is her.
- Who?

264
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,666
For whom I got this envelope.

265
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:12,566
What is it? Show me.

266
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,741
My Prince sent it.

267
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,680
You may go. Go!

268
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:38,092
The fish are biting me!

269
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:43,699
Dear Miss Bhanu,
Here's your book.

270
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,442
You must be upset
at losing your book.

271
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:52,106
The truth is I couldn't
bear to see you upset.

272
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:57,714
When you were scared stiff of
Allarakhi being exposed to your Dad.

273
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:02,059
That is the reason why
I took her back with me.

274
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:09,056
Your father's words tell
that you are one with nature.

275
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:13,666
But you have nobody to share solitude

276
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:22,069
But you have none to share solitude

277
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:32,079
Nobody to share solitary moments.

278
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,583
I am taking liberties.

279
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:41,088
If you wish, I can take you
on a tour of these scenic spots.

280
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,762
Because like you,
I love these scenes.

281
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:48,698
Who knows...maybe the
goal you seek in life...

282
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:07,389
Now you've found a
partner for your solitude.

283
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,050
Blushing?

284
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,114
If I can't be with you
I will assume...

285
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:20,121
...happiness didn't pass me by

286
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:27,129
If I can't have you,
I will assume that..

287
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:34,135
Life passed me by
but I didn't live life

288
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:03,108
You are the life of every verse

289
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:10,108
You are the melody and
the voice in the songs

290
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:17,112
You are the sun that
brightens the heart

291
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,457
You are the sun

292
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:27,121
If I can't have you,
I will assume...

293
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:33,798
No light brightened my universe

294
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:17,114
The world is bright and
beautiful for you are in it

295
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:24,116
You constitute the
earth and the sky for me

296
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:30,618
You are my world of
dreams and fantasies

297
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,121
My world..

298
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:41,129
If I can't have you
I will assume..

299
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,137
The dreams are just dreams
and will never come true

300
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:22,773
With great confidence
I have asked for your hand

301
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:29,519
My love wants you forever

302
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:38,624
The thirst in the hearts
asks for the nectar of love

303
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,533
The thirst in the hearts
asks for the nectar of love

304
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:50,540
If I can't have you,
I will assume..

305
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:57,542
We still have to
wait to get each other

306
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,110
Stop it. Don't ever mention this.

307
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:39,852
Do you hear me?
You may now leave.

308
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,122
Terrible times are upon us.

309
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,121
The boys of today have no
regard for family honour.

310
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,630
There was a time when families
were matched for weddings.

311
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:52,797
The daughter-in-law
is not a vegetable.

312
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:56,129
You buy from the market.
Why did I live for this day?

313
00:34:58,143 --> 00:34:59,804
Did you hear?
Rajesh says...

314
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,737
He wants to get married.

315
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,071
Saxena's family
can't match up to ours.

316
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:07,482
Maybe the Prince likes her
Hence he's asking for permission.

317
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,815
Who is he to take this decision?

318
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,756
Your son.
Your blood.

319
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:16,753
My son? My blood?

320
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:18,756
And he wants to destroy
our family prestige!

321
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,489
No. Your son wants her
to be his life partner.

322
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,760
He can happily spend the
rest of his life with her.

323
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:30,438
And your heart is so generous..

324
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:33,100
It does not care about
castes, discrimination...

325
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:39,113
Only you could consider a clerk's
daughter as your own child.

326
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,710
I am respected more than
a daughter in your family.

327
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,111
But I don't belong to
a high caste or family.

328
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:46,788
Nor do I possess special qualities.

329
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,450
Similarly when Bhanu
comes to your refuge..

330
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,119
Dust will turn to gold.

331
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:54,462
Stone will glimmer like the sun.

332
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,536
You are angelic.

333
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:03,063
Your son has asked
for the gift of love.

334
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:05,072
Will you send him back empty handed?

335
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:11,411
Acquiesce from your heart
will bring a smile to your child.

336
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,075
Permission granted from
your benevolent heart...

337
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,682
You've given your acceptance.

338
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,684
Shall I tell the Prince and
bring a smile to his lips?

339
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,102
Can't you see where you're going?

340
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:38,840
Buffalo!

341
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,510
Calling me a buffalo! You frog!

342
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:47,607
What a dirty mouth!

343
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:52,112
- Good day sir. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

344
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,727
Look at the lovely ornaments and
clothes Bhanu's in-laws have sent.

345
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,060
Exquisite.

346
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:14,567
His Highness wasn't lying.

347
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,743
God created you with great love.

348
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:25,078
- You..?
- Madhavi.

349
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,490
His sister?

350
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:31,493
You can only guess.

351
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:33,495
Actually I'm not related.

352
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,097
But I'm given a lot of regard.

353
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,091
You'll find out when you get there.

354
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:44,506
How she looks at me!

355
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:47,105
Sister-in-law...

356
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:49,375
Any message to be sent?

357
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:52,105
- Where?
- To the beloved's kingdom

358
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,450
Say whatever you wish.

359
00:37:58,122 --> 00:38:03,059
- Then I'll say..
- Take me home as soon as possible.

360
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:06,058
Why did you come here?

361
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:58,098
You're wonderful.

362
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:00,104
Great is your glory.

363
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:02,439
The dumbbell rattles.

364
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:08,517
Hail Bajrangbali.

365
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,520
Conquer the enemies.

366
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:46,748
- What...?
- The Queen Mother...

367
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,752
....has given me this sari
for the Prince's engagement.

368
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:53,153
Great. But when will you wear it?

369
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:56,497
I won't wear such a pretty sari.
I'll treasure it carefully.

370
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:59,659
- For your wedding?
- No, for your wife.

371
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,098
Get married soon.

372
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:02,837
Who will want to marry me?

373
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:06,599
Why? Are you dumb or deaf?

374
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:09,602
- Squint eyed...
- What do you lack?

375
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:12,446
- She is right.
- Tell him.

376
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,644
Friend, I have just one dream.

377
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:22,118
I want to find her a good
groom and get her married.

378
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:28,124
So nobody says, the brother did
not care for the parents were dead.

379
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:31,625
Silly boy. Why do you talk like
this with me and mother around?

380
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:36,630
I'll marry her in such style
that everyone will watch astounded.

381
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:39,735
I came to remind you that
the boat race is tomorrow.

382
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:41,805
Let me remind you tomorrow is rakhi.

383
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,142
So what? We'll leave early
and return by 10 o'clock.

384
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:48,646
Can't trust brother. He finds
friends and forgets everyone.

385
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:51,819
I won't let you go tomorrow.

386
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:55,557
Do you trust me?

387
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,889
I'll drag him home
right after the boat race.

388
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:00,523
Believe me. It's my responsibility.

389
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:02,588
It's my responsibility.

390
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:09,538
Mad at me?

391
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,098
- As if you care.
- I want your ears.

392
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:13,774
Shall I get a knife?

393
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:15,772
Silly girl. I want to bribe them.

394
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:18,104
So they can hear well.

395
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:20,507
I say something but
they hear something else.

396
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:23,115
How beautiful!

397
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:26,783
Tomorrow is rakhi so
I bought these for my sister.

398
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,517
- Wear them. - Not today.
I'll wear them tomorrow.

399
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,126
You can help me.

400
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,724
They look expensive.
Where did you get them?

401
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:35,621
Don't worry, I paid for them.

402
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:39,625
Remember the gold medal I won
for the boat race last year?

403
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:41,627
I gave that in exchange.

404
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:43,629
That's not good.

405
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:46,132
That was a sign of your victory.

406
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:48,634
I win medals every year.

407
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:53,139
But great sisters like you
are hard to come by.

408
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:21,704
My dear brother,
my precious jewel..

409
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:28,518
I wouldn't exchange you
for anything in the world

410
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,117
My dear brother,
my precious jewel..

411
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:41,861
I wouldn't exchange you
for anything in the world

412
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:04,085
The breeze is
inspired by your passion

413
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:10,083
Spring comes when I sight you

414
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:17,762
When you are out of my
sight for even a moment..

415
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:24,439
My eyes search and
call out for you

416
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:14,081
For the fragrant flowers
you will wear as a groom..

417
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:20,830
I have woven dreams
of innumerable flowers

418
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:27,765
May the day dawn when
these dreams come true

419
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:34,100
The beautiful dreams
that I have woven for you

420
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,062
I think Kaushal will win the race.

421
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:12,058
Your Highness, I'm coming!

422
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:43,089
Pull!! Pull!

423
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:49,497
I wouldn't exchange you
for anything in the world

424
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,615
Everything in the world
is mine with you by my side

425
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:24,124
Nothing is more valuable than love

426
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:32,131
My dear brother,
my priceless jewel

427
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:48,889
Finally you guys have come.

428
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,152
You were to return at 10.
What is the time?

429
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:56,155
Doesn't matter. Today is
rakhi so I won't scold you.

430
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,831
We'll see tomorrow.

431
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,501
What's the matter?

432
00:51:03,107 --> 00:51:05,507
Looks like you lost the race.

433
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:08,772
And where is the Captain?

434
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:10,774
Is he feeling shy?

435
00:51:13,117 --> 00:51:15,108
Why? Scared of me?

436
00:51:15,452 --> 00:51:16,783
That I might scream at you.

437
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:18,785
Why don't you say
he's gone with friends?

438
00:51:19,123 --> 00:51:20,522
You had taken him.

439
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,592
He must have sent some message.

440
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,529
Kaushal is mad at us.

441
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:30,623
What? He won't talk to me?

442
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,127
No brother gets mad at
his sister on rakhi.

443
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,135
Kaushal won't talk to
you or anyone of us.

444
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:42,874
He'll never return.

445
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,640
What?

446
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:49,816
Where is my brother?

447
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:53,623
You had taken him!
I handed him over to you!

448
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:56,157
Where did you leave him
all by himself?

449
00:51:57,161 --> 00:51:58,651
Where did you leave him?

450
00:51:59,163 --> 00:52:03,099
Don't fool with me.

451
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:05,591
Don't take my brother away from me!

452
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:08,594
Please...I beg you!

453
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,836
Go and get him. Please.

454
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:17,103
Go. Go and get him.

455
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:21,778
How can I get him?

456
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:24,111
How? He can never return.

457
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:27,522
The whirlpool swallowed him!
The lake gulped him down!

458
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,524
He drowned in the lake...

459
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:29,517
Deliver this.

460
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,519
To the palace.

461
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:35,114
You write letters
and I deliver them.

462
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:38,117
But God knows if anyone reads them.

463
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:40,721
I hope you don't give
my letters to anyone else.

464
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:45,124
I swear by God, many must
be eying the letters...

465
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:47,626
But Jharna can be trusted.

466
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:55,140
I understand who is writing
the letter and for whom.

467
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:59,479
But the sad part is that
there's no answer from there.

468
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,084
He is in mourning.

469
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,418
Bless his soul!
Was he related to him?

470
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,089
He was the son of their clerk.

471
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:11,083
Yes, he was Madhavi's brother.

472
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:15,087
You're repeating the same thing.

473
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:18,090
Crying won't bring Kaushal back.

474
00:54:19,503 --> 00:54:21,835
However hard it might be...

475
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:25,099
Now you must be brave.

476
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:28,771
Mother, why am I being punished?

477
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:35,847
I feel like jumping into
the lake Kaushal died.

478
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,849
That will end my sorrows.

479
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:43,456
Yes, dear. It might
end your sorrows.

480
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:49,792
But how will it end the sorrows
of those saddened by your sorrows?

481
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,625
Look at Rajesh.

482
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:56,469
What he has done to himself.

483
00:54:57,608 --> 00:55:00,133
He is not bothered
with eating or dressing.

484
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,542
When he sees me,
he clings to me and cries..

485
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:09,075
I killed Kaushal.

486
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:11,850
I had taken him away from Madhavi.

487
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,819
I am his murderer!

488
00:55:16,093 --> 00:55:18,084
And he cries his heart out.

489
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:22,690
Mother, now what do I do?

490
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:29,095
You tell him what to do.

491
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:34,703
His soul is punishing him.

492
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:40,106
Only you can liberate
him from this sorrow.

493
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:46,112
Being a woman is very difficult.

494
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:51,590
Woman and the earth
have to tolerate a lot.

495
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,724
Endure and suffer...

496
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:04,665
Did you call for me?

497
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:09,545
Then you have forgotten me.

498
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,571
That is why for many days
you didn't come to meet me.

499
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:18,418
I don't know what I said that day..

500
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:20,086
You were right.

501
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:23,559
I am responsible for taking
a brother away from his sister.

502
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:28,496
- Kaushal's death...
- No..don't say that.

503
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,824
I have got the fruit of my deeds.

504
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:38,702
Is it not possible for me
to take Kaushal's place?

505
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,600
Your Highness..

506
00:56:42,846 --> 00:56:44,108
Mother!

507
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:02,394
Beloved, come to see me

508
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:09,061
The heavy heart cries out

509
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:15,067
Beloved, come to see me

510
00:58:31,087 --> 00:58:32,486
No mother, that is not possible.

511
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:34,488
How can I explain..?

512
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:39,585
For him and the world,
Madhavi is my friends' sister.

513
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:44,089
But mother, you know
she is the soul of our home.

514
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:48,093
This palace echoed with
her laughter and her music.

515
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,432
Today silence looms large here.

516
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,106
The silence of death.

517
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,771
How can I get married?

518
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:57,773
How...?

519
00:58:58,114 --> 00:58:59,843
I understand everything.

520
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:04,386
For so many days, my
baby angel hasn't smiled.

521
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:07,717
As if he too is unhappy
for Madhavi and her sorrow.

522
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,722
But for some reason, I could
not bear to see Saxena's state.

523
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:16,062
He kept saying..

524
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,728
Your command will be carried out.

525
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:23,062
But I am the father of a daughter.

526
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:28,066
Who is playing with
Madhavi's sitar?

527
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,557
Madhavi?

528
00:59:44,094 --> 00:59:47,086
Yes, I was sad so I thought
these strings would liven me.

529
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:52,491
When you touched the strings,
I felt the walls were singing.

530
00:59:57,107 --> 00:59:58,438
Shall I say something?

531
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:00,770
Yes, do.

532
01:00:02,112 --> 01:00:04,103
If you turn me down,
I'll be disheartened.

533
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:07,106
I'll get you the stars
from the sky if you wish...

534
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:08,681
Why do I need them?

535
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,782
I feel lonely in this huge house.

536
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:15,117
I wish I had a friend.

537
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:16,856
I'll get her if you permit.

538
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,121
- Whom?
- My sister-in-law.

539
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:20,793
Bhanu.

540
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:24,733
Do you recall once you told me..

541
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:27,732
You would take Kaushal's
place in my life.

542
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:31,130
Then can't you do this
little thing for me?

543
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,133
Are you so eager for
me to get married?

544
01:00:35,812 --> 01:00:37,803
Who wouldn't want
a sister-in-law?

545
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:40,140
Who wouldn't want
a sister-in-law?

546
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,600
Welcome, sister-in-law.

547
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:13,582
This is the goal of
your peace and happiness.

548
01:01:14,117 --> 01:01:15,778
Your world of joys.

549
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:18,785
A world where everything is novel.

550
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:22,116
Every article is
anxious to welcome you.

551
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:26,129
Lift your eyes and take
a look at this world of stars

552
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:28,120
Isn't this the world of your dreams?

553
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:31,123
You will reign over this place.

554
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:35,127
If you wish, you can crown
somebody king of your heart.

555
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:37,136
Or lovingly make him your slave.

556
01:01:45,148 --> 01:01:47,139
Do you know who adorned our bed?

557
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:49,550
Madhavi?

558
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:52,815
She is the life of our home.

559
01:01:55,158 --> 01:01:56,819
And your Bhanu...?

560
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:00,493
You are my life.

561
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,496
And Madhavi is my happiness.

562
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:05,090
Both are needed to live.

563
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:43,132
The result of prayers of a lifetime

564
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:49,635
Let the emotions run wild

565
01:02:51,147 --> 01:02:55,140
The result of prayers of a lifetime

566
01:02:57,153 --> 01:03:01,089
Let the emotions now run wild

567
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:08,759
In the manner of the
meeting of two souls..'

568
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:15,094
Let the lips too be one

569
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:41,464
Take the veil off the bosom

570
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:47,627
Flick the tresses off your face

571
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:54,133
Take the veil off the bosom

572
01:03:55,612 --> 01:04:00,549
Flick the tresses off your face

573
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:07,079
Flick them off

574
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:14,086
These passing moments..

575
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:20,092
Give them a reason to stop

576
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:46,619
Moments of pure rosebuds..

577
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:53,127
..do not often come our way

578
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:59,531
Moments of pure rosebuds..

579
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:05,804
..do not often come our way

580
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:19,094
Let us lose everything tonight

581
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:25,090
Let us gain everything tonight

582
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:44,114
What is it?

583
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:48,113
We had heard that the Queen
Mother bought an elephant in dowry.

584
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,122
What did the new bride get?

585
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:52,788
A frog!

586
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:05,799
Give me a drink

587
01:07:06,569 --> 01:07:09,060
I've seen such scenes

588
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:11,064
My heart is swinging

589
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:14,066
My dear friends

590
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:17,069
Give me a drink

591
01:07:18,081 --> 01:07:20,072
I've seen such scenes

592
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:22,412
My heart is swinging

593
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:25,077
Dear friends

594
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:28,580
I am amazed

595
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:33,085
How you have changed
You were so naive

596
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:36,088
Dear friend

597
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:59,111
Don't consider me a saint
Today I forgo my penance

598
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:07,793
Don't consider me a saint

599
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:10,398
Today I forgo my penance

600
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:15,561
Your youth has
jerked my youth awake

601
01:08:16,072 --> 01:08:18,404
It has roused my manhood

602
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:21,066
Get lost silly man

603
01:08:21,577 --> 01:08:26,071
Why do you publicly
announce your naivety?

604
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:05,043
Control your heart

605
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:08,046
And the hurt in your heart

606
01:09:14,397 --> 01:09:16,058
Don't wander with broken heart

607
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:19,057
Cover up the hurt

608
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:24,665
Finally you've agreed on
what you earlier disagreed

609
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:27,399
Why did you disagree then?

610
01:09:28,077 --> 01:09:32,673
Why do you fight with me?
I've given up the war to you

611
01:10:17,126 --> 01:10:21,722
My heart sighs for you
don't torment me so

612
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:27,625
Go to hell

613
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:30,128
My heart sighs for you

614
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,531
Don't torment me so

615
01:10:33,142 --> 01:10:35,610
Embrace me with a smile

616
01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:38,136
My love cries out for you

617
01:10:39,148 --> 01:10:40,809
My love cries out for you

618
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:43,150
Your brain is rusty

619
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:46,144
Why do you try to prove otherwise?

620
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,476
Come in.

621
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,141
- Madhavi?
- Yes.

622
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:54,486
Are you still sleepy?

623
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:58,649
Then why are your
eyes looking so tired?

624
01:12:01,097 --> 01:12:05,090
Now tell me how you find
this new house and family?

625
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:09,099
Why do you take the trouble?

626
01:12:10,106 --> 01:12:11,698
From tomorrow
Jharna will get us tea.

627
01:12:12,108 --> 01:12:13,700
Jharna has new.

628
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:16,101
I've been serving tea
to the Prince for years.

629
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:20,442
That is right. I don't like
anyone else making me tea.

630
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:25,117
I'll make Bhanu's tea.
Please get my clothes ready.

631
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:37,122
Madam, 2 spoons sugar?

632
01:12:42,138 --> 01:12:43,571
Hey...

633
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,540
- Another spoon?
- Yes, 2.

634
01:13:09,098 --> 01:13:09,587
Lord Bajrangbali, do good.

635
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:18,096
My good Lord.

636
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:25,774
Praise the Lord Hanuman

637
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:34,114
Glory to the Lord's name

638
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,139
Hey girl!

639
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:55,808
Get up!

640
01:13:58,147 --> 01:13:59,808
Get up! Come on!

641
01:14:00,483 --> 01:14:02,542
Have you come to
defile a bachelor's hut?

642
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:05,078
Wait, I'll show you!

643
01:14:05,354 --> 01:14:06,685
I'll incinerate you!

644
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:13,493
Get up.

645
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:23,102
Lizard!

646
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:27,507
Lizard!

647
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:30,578
Liz...!

648
01:14:34,116 --> 01:14:35,606
Lizard!

649
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:43,715
- Why are you screaming?
- Li...

650
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:46,719
What bud have you got me?

651
01:14:49,131 --> 01:14:50,598
Lily?

652
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:53,795
I didn't get it.
It fell from the ceiling!

653
01:14:54,136 --> 01:14:56,468
In your veil! A lizard..!

654
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,079
The maid servants here
never go to the servant's rooms.

655
01:15:07,082 --> 01:15:08,572
Mind you. I don't want
to see you here again.

656
01:15:10,085 --> 01:15:12,576
- Actually.. - Whatever it
is, I don't want to hear.

657
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:14,086
Your mistress is asking for you.

658
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,820
Bhola, pack the Queen Mother's
bags. She's going to see the guru.

659
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:27,432
Gently.

660
01:15:28,704 --> 01:15:31,764
You said, you don't believe in spells.

661
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:34,671
- Now you must admit..
- What?

662
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,443
Isn't this witchcraft?
Everyone dances to Madhavi's tune.

663
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:41,605
Servants, His Highness,
the Queen Mother...

664
01:15:42,117 --> 01:15:44,108
Everyone obeys her.

665
01:15:44,787 --> 01:15:47,779
You're the mistress but
Madhavi orders everyone.

666
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:51,456
God knows what spell
the witch has cast!

667
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:08,074
- Show me what you've got.
- First shut your eyes.

668
01:16:17,486 --> 01:16:19,078
You're too much.

669
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:22,421
You got me two saris
of the same design.

670
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:24,423
The other one is for Madhavi.

671
01:16:26,095 --> 01:16:28,563
Madhavi makes his tea.
Madhavi fixes his clothes!

672
01:16:29,098 --> 01:16:30,588
Madhavi sings hymns!

673
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:36,765
I met your Daddy. He's
invited us for dinner.

674
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,101
He wanted you to stay
with him for a few days.

675
01:16:52,121 --> 01:16:53,611
Your Daddy still hasn't come.

676
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:01,721
Shall I leave?

677
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:05,061
Stay here tonight.

678
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:07,063
Near me.

679
01:17:13,809 --> 01:17:15,071
I would love to.

680
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:17,670
- But...
- But?

681
01:17:19,081 --> 01:17:21,743
You know mother has
gone to visit her master.

682
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:23,745
And Madhavi is alone at home.

683
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:28,556
How is she related to you?

684
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:31,081
I to mean something.

685
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:36,087
Why did you have to ruin my life
if you can't live without Madhavi?

686
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:54,112
Listen...

687
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:07,051
You know that I love you.

688
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:12,464
I never imagined this is
what you think of me.

689
01:18:13,736 --> 01:18:15,067
Forgive me.

690
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:20,667
I don't know what I
said in a fit of rage.

691
01:18:30,753 --> 01:18:33,085
The truth is...

692
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:36,080
I can't stay a minute away from you.

693
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,586
You are stupid.

694
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:46,090
But a good one.

695
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:49,593
Good girls don't say such things.

696
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,099
It's getting late. Go.

697
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:57,601
Shall I go?

698
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:07,045
Go before we change our minds.

699
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:24,733
Everyone knows. Only
you are so gullible..

700
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:26,735
...that you see nothing.

701
01:19:27,076 --> 01:19:28,475
What?

702
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:33,481
Mother is sent to visit her
guru when you go to your Dad's.

703
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,744
- That's it.
- What?

704
01:19:37,086 --> 01:19:39,577
The Prince kept looking
at his watch for an hour.

705
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:41,681
Not because he never saw one.

706
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:46,755
Only so the moment he was
waiting for does not pass.

707
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:03,601
It's not so funny.

708
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:10,108
I'm amused because now
sister-in-law will have to bind you.

709
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,519
So she can keep you close.

710
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:15,852
Poor sister-in-law does
not understand anything.

711
01:20:17,126 --> 01:20:19,788
She understands but
hesitates to mention it.

712
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,722
Why did you come with me?

713
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:26,124
If I'd come with you,
how would I ruin this party?

714
01:20:45,154 --> 01:20:47,645
Now we must find a
groom for Madhavi.

715
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:50,153
She's grown big.

716
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,593
You are right.

717
01:20:54,163 --> 01:20:55,494
She's too mature.

718
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:58,565
I don't have to hide from you.

719
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:01,364
Going to visit my guru
was simply an excuse.

720
01:21:02,104 --> 01:21:05,096
I went because the
priest had seen a boy.

721
01:21:05,774 --> 01:21:07,105
Did you like him?

722
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:11,705
The boy and his family are good.

723
01:21:12,614 --> 01:21:14,707
Our priest will speak to the family.

724
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:26,791
Take this. Today is Rakhi.

725
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:30,462
I thought you too might
want to tie it to somebody.

726
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:38,732
I understand but how will talk
to Thakur Ratan Singh's mother?

727
01:21:39,474 --> 01:21:41,806
She says, Madhavi is bad luck.

728
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,135
She killed her mother on birth.

729
01:21:45,147 --> 01:21:46,478
She grew up only to kill her brother.

730
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:48,639
I can't hide anything from you.

731
01:21:48,884 --> 01:21:53,651
She even said, her shadow
can wither a flowering tree.

732
01:21:54,156 --> 01:21:56,147
To blazes with Thakur
Ratan Singh and his mother!

733
01:21:57,159 --> 01:22:00,151
Please tell them we don't want to
give our angelic daughter to them!

734
01:22:01,096 --> 01:22:02,757
If they can use such
words for Madhavi today...

735
01:22:03,098 --> 01:22:04,588
What will they do later?

736
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,761
We don't want to have
relations with such a family.

737
01:22:23,118 --> 01:22:24,779
Jharna, you're back!

738
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,451
Yes.

739
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,855
What will sister say if she sees you?

740
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:31,592
Now what can she say?

741
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:33,617
Now I will speak.

742
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:35,528
What about?

743
01:22:36,465 --> 01:22:37,864
About your sister.

744
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:40,128
About your Madhavi.

745
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:43,127
You too must hear it.

746
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:47,138
Sister, forgive me.

747
01:22:48,143 --> 01:22:52,136
I couldn't stay away
after what I heard.

748
01:22:53,815 --> 01:22:56,875
Rumour mongers even said..

749
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:01,088
I can't even say it.

750
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:04,081
Spill out whatever you heard.

751
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,092
They said Madhavi is a witch.

752
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:09,697
She killed her brother on rakhi.

753
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,590
Now it's the turn of His Highness.

754
01:23:14,102 --> 01:23:18,562
If Madhavi ties him a rakhi
But this is false.

755
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,102
I don't believe it.

756
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:23,100
Tie me a rakhi. I am ready.

757
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,110
Go away.

758
01:23:39,127 --> 01:23:41,118
An unfortunate has to be cursed.

759
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,132
Missing Kaushal?

760
01:23:54,543 --> 01:23:56,875
I too have been tormented
by his memories since morning.

761
01:23:58,146 --> 01:23:59,636
Won't you tie me the rakhi?

762
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:02,748
Madhavi is a witch.
She killed her brother.

763
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:04,677
Now it's the turn of His Highness.

764
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,577
It's his turn!

765
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:32,439
Did he come to give you the bangles?

766
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:34,514
But you didn't tie him the rakhi.

767
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:36,112
Maybe you couldn't tie it.

768
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,587
How could you tie it?

769
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:44,559
These silken thread can bear
a sister's love like a petal.

770
01:24:45,727 --> 01:24:47,854
Those hands would
tremble to lift it..

771
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:51,861
...when there's something
else in your mind.

772
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:55,129
- Sister-in-law!
- I got this rakhi on purpose.

773
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:59,740
Only to see if Madhavi really
considers him a brother...

774
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:03,069
She will tie the
rakhi for his welfare

775
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:06,570
- For his welfare...
- Yes, his longevity.

776
01:25:07,749 --> 01:25:10,582
It doesn't mean you hold
his hand and keep the bangles.

777
01:25:11,686 --> 01:25:13,677
And will explain to him
with lowered lashes...

778
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,489
I'm can't tie you a rakhi.

779
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:19,082
The Prince of my heart
how is this possible?

780
01:25:19,694 --> 01:25:21,491
Sister-in-law, stop it!

781
01:25:24,099 --> 01:25:26,761
I warn you, this
won't go on longer!

782
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:30,765
I will gouge out the eyes
that look at my husband!

783
01:25:32,107 --> 01:25:35,770
Shameless! You address me
as sister-in-law but rival me!

784
01:25:37,112 --> 01:25:39,103
Drown yourself if you have any shame!

785
01:25:40,115 --> 01:25:42,106
Your brother had more shame.

786
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:45,117
He couldn't bear to see your
behaviour so he took his life!

787
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:48,112
But I won't give up my life.

788
01:25:48,457 --> 01:25:49,788
I'll take life if needed!

789
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,786
Shut up!

790
01:25:52,794 --> 01:25:54,125
Ungrateful...!

791
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:59,123
Stop this nonsense lest I turn mad!

792
01:26:13,081 --> 01:26:14,480
Shameless!

793
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:17,745
You address me as sister-in-law
but vie for my husband's attention!

794
01:26:20,088 --> 01:26:22,079
You address me as sister-in-law
but vie for my husband's attention!

795
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:47,105
For the electric smile
that charges up your face..

796
01:26:49,117 --> 01:26:55,113
I have picked innumerable
flowers of anticipation

797
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:03,530
May the day dawn when
these dreams come true

798
01:27:05,066 --> 01:27:11,062
For the beautiful dreams
that I have woven for you

799
01:27:37,098 --> 01:27:39,089
Son! Rajesh!!

800
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,095
- Mother, what's wrong?
- It is terrible!

801
01:27:46,107 --> 01:27:47,506
Madhavi has left.

802
01:27:48,109 --> 01:27:51,101
I searched everywhere but
she's nowhere to be found.

803
01:27:52,113 --> 01:27:55,105
- No..
- These bangles were lying on my bed

804
01:27:57,852 --> 01:27:59,114
My heart is pounding!

805
01:27:59,788 --> 01:28:01,050
I hope all is well.

806
01:29:36,547 --> 01:29:39,675
Madhavi, tell me
why did you do this?

807
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:42,484
Answer me..

808
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:45,078
Don't I have the right to know?

809
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:50,090
I don't want..

810
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:52,494
....that you..

811
01:29:53,097 --> 01:29:54,428
and sister-in-law..

812
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:56,566
Sister-in-law...

813
01:29:58,102 --> 01:30:01,765
You worry about her and
I worry about all of you.

814
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:05,507
You know how to reduce the
burden on your heart with tears.

815
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:08,772
And now you've learnt
to run away from home.

816
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:13,106
If Kaushal were in my place,
would you have left him?

817
01:30:16,521 --> 01:30:19,115
Forgive me!

818
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,525
Brother, forgive me.

819
01:30:39,076 --> 01:30:40,668
Won't you talk to me?

820
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,570
Are you still mad at me?

821
01:30:45,082 --> 01:30:46,481
No.

822
01:30:47,084 --> 01:30:50,076
I speak the truth
I will never hurt you.

823
01:30:51,088 --> 01:30:52,817
Believe me, it's true.

824
01:31:27,124 --> 01:31:29,786
- Hello, Mr. Moti.
- How are you?

825
01:31:30,127 --> 01:31:31,788
Forgive me for the delay.

826
01:31:33,397 --> 01:31:35,058
How is your sister?

827
01:31:36,067 --> 01:31:39,468
- Fine, I came to thank..
- For what?

828
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:41,069
That's my duty as a
human being that I did.

829
01:31:43,074 --> 01:31:45,474
That reminds me, I wanted
to take your advice.

830
01:31:46,077 --> 01:31:48,671
- Regarding?
- I'm new to this city.

831
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,742
Do you know Raibahadur Chotelal?

832
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:55,075
- How is he?
- The one who has a timber factory?

833
01:31:56,087 --> 01:31:58,078
- The same..
- I know him well.

834
01:31:58,422 --> 01:31:59,684
Very decent man.

835
01:32:00,424 --> 01:32:03,086
I am buying that factory.

836
01:32:04,095 --> 01:32:05,687
- Are you?
- Take a seat.

837
01:32:06,764 --> 01:32:09,096
My father has a big
factory in Africa.

838
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,092
And he wants me to head it.

839
01:32:11,702 --> 01:32:14,432
But I want to stay
in my own country.

840
01:32:15,106 --> 01:32:16,596
You seem to love your country.

841
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:20,103
Not only the country,
specially this city.

842
01:32:20,511 --> 01:32:22,502
According to my father,
I was born in this city.

843
01:32:23,114 --> 01:32:25,105
I think you have to go
someplace. I'll take leave.

844
01:32:25,449 --> 01:32:27,110
Something about the factory.

845
01:32:28,119 --> 01:32:30,110
Madhavi is very embarrassed.

846
01:32:30,621 --> 01:32:32,111
She wasn't able to meet you.

847
01:32:33,457 --> 01:32:35,721
Tomorrow is my wedding
anniversary. You must come.

848
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,051
- I will.
- Thank you very much.

849
01:33:05,556 --> 01:33:09,083
The bells on my feet tinkle

850
01:33:10,094 --> 01:33:13,086
The bells on my feet tinkle

851
01:33:14,098 --> 01:33:17,693
Radha wanders around
blushing with passion

852
01:33:19,103 --> 01:33:22,095
The bells on my feet tinkle

853
01:33:27,111 --> 01:33:29,602
Radha wanders around
blushing with passion

854
01:34:08,586 --> 01:34:12,420
Her veil slips off
when she strides away

855
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:17,083
Her beauty spilling over

856
01:34:18,095 --> 01:34:21,758
Her veil slips off
when she strides away

857
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,092
Her beauty spilling over

858
01:34:27,104 --> 01:34:30,767
Her fair skin glowing..

859
01:34:31,442 --> 01:34:35,640
Her fair skin glowing..

860
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:39,713
And hips swaying

861
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:24,417
The frenzy increases by the minute

862
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:29,088
How does one get away from home?

863
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:34,434
The frenzy increases by the minute

864
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:38,031
How does one get away from home?

865
01:35:39,043 --> 01:35:43,036
My anklets are my enemy

866
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:47,042
My anklets give me away

867
01:35:48,052 --> 01:35:51,510
They give away the
secrets of my heart

868
01:36:41,372 --> 01:36:45,035
The maiden torments for her beloved

869
01:36:46,043 --> 01:36:49,035
Like the partridge
pines for the moon

870
01:36:50,047 --> 01:36:54,040
The maiden torments for her beloved

871
01:36:55,052 --> 01:36:58,453
Like the partridge
pines for the moon

872
01:36:59,723 --> 01:37:03,454
Stealthily she goes to meet him

873
01:37:04,061 --> 01:37:08,054
Stealthily she goes to meet him

874
01:37:09,066 --> 01:37:12,467
When her mother-in-law
and sister-in-law go to bed

875
01:37:58,048 --> 01:38:00,039
Glory to Lord Rama, Sita's groom

876
01:38:07,391 --> 01:38:08,722
Yes mother?

877
01:38:09,059 --> 01:38:11,050
Rajesh approves of the man.

878
01:38:13,063 --> 01:38:17,056
His wife too insists
that we must not delay.

879
01:38:22,072 --> 01:38:27,066
Someday every girl comes
to the cross roads where..

880
01:38:28,078 --> 01:38:30,410
She has to pick one path.

881
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:37,681
what do you think of Mr. Moti?

882
01:38:40,024 --> 01:38:41,423
Tell me..

883
01:38:43,027 --> 01:38:47,430
Mother, your decision
will be a blessing for me.

884
01:38:47,765 --> 01:38:49,630
Live long, my darling.

885
01:38:52,036 --> 01:38:55,028
Girls like you bring
honour to the family name.

886
01:38:58,042 --> 01:39:00,033
Poor Madhavi...

887
01:39:01,045 --> 01:39:03,036
You wealthy are great.

888
01:39:05,049 --> 01:39:08,382
Your Highness, you should
have asked, who I am...

889
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,050
Where I come from?
What I am..

890
01:39:11,055 --> 01:39:17,051
I don't need to probe about one
who risks his life to save another

891
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:21,554
That is true but...

892
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:26,062
My father too desires
that I get married.

893
01:39:27,071 --> 01:39:31,064
But I am adamant that till
man stands on his own feet...

894
01:39:32,076 --> 01:39:33,737
He has no right to get married.

895
01:39:34,078 --> 01:39:37,343
But your father is a
wealthy businessman.

896
01:39:38,082 --> 01:39:41,074
Yes but that's my father not me.

897
01:39:43,087 --> 01:39:46,682
The truth is I was expecting
a draft from my father.

898
01:39:48,092 --> 01:39:49,582
Today is the 23rd.
It has still not come.

899
01:39:51,095 --> 01:39:55,691
I have to pay an installment of
30000 before the 25th for the mill.

900
01:39:57,434 --> 01:40:00,096
- If it isn't paid..
- That won't happen.

901
01:40:01,105 --> 01:40:02,629
We can serve you.

902
01:40:04,108 --> 01:40:06,599
But how can I take...

903
01:40:06,777 --> 01:40:09,837
Don't hesitate. Pay me
back when the draft comes.

904
01:40:11,515 --> 01:40:14,109
I am dumb struck.

905
01:40:20,124 --> 01:40:22,786
I am handing over the
life of the palace to you.

906
01:40:24,128 --> 01:40:26,119
If Madhavi ever errs...

907
01:40:27,131 --> 01:40:28,792
Consider it was my
mistake and forgive her.

908
01:40:30,134 --> 01:40:37,063
I had thought this was home

909
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:48,814
Today I discover I was a guest

910
01:40:54,091 --> 01:41:00,087
The ones I thought
were my family...

911
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:09,095
I am a stranger for all of them

912
01:41:13,577 --> 01:41:17,104
My lost childhood..

913
01:41:19,116 --> 01:41:21,107
Give it back to me

914
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:28,717
Explain to me what
mistake I committed

915
01:41:39,403 --> 01:41:45,069
Why do the lips bid me farewell?

916
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:56,076
Once I was the smile
that played on those lips

917
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:06,087
May you be happy

918
01:42:10,701 --> 01:42:16,105
Now I leave you to go far away

919
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:32,112
The lanes are now alien

920
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:42,565
There was a time when
I was known to them

921
01:42:52,743 --> 01:42:54,074
Where?

922
01:42:54,578 --> 01:42:56,068
This is the house.

923
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,741
And here's the advance.

924
01:42:59,082 --> 01:43:02,074
- And the rest?
- After the job is done.

925
01:43:02,419 --> 01:43:03,750
Consider it done.

926
01:43:06,089 --> 01:43:09,081
- Daughter Amba...
- Coming, uncle.

927
01:43:10,093 --> 01:43:11,583
Job done?

928
01:43:13,096 --> 01:43:14,586
Positively.

929
01:43:15,098 --> 01:43:17,089
Do you remember all you have to do?

930
01:43:17,601 --> 01:43:19,091
Every word. Come on.

931
01:43:21,104 --> 01:43:23,766
- Spinsters don't walk like this.
- Then..?

932
01:43:24,107 --> 01:43:25,438
Like this.

933
01:43:27,110 --> 01:43:29,101
Oh uncle! Watch me.

934
01:43:33,116 --> 01:43:34,640
I'll open the door..

935
01:43:36,053 --> 01:43:37,714
You stand here and blush
like an unmarried girl.

936
01:43:42,793 --> 01:43:44,055
He's come.

937
01:43:47,064 --> 01:43:48,554
Who are you?

938
01:43:49,066 --> 01:43:51,398
- Speak up.
- Who are you?

939
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:55,561
Pre-ordained? That's what I mean.

940
01:43:57,074 --> 01:44:02,068
I search for you everywhere
my girl anxious to meet you.

941
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,672
But who are you?

942
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:07,573
I am Shastri Gopaldas.

943
01:44:09,753 --> 01:44:11,084
Then please come in.

944
01:44:12,089 --> 01:44:13,488
Bring mother in too.

945
01:44:14,091 --> 01:44:15,581
Do I look that old?

946
01:44:16,093 --> 01:44:18,084
Her mother is no more.

947
01:44:18,762 --> 01:44:20,093
And father is in the asylum.

948
01:44:21,098 --> 01:44:22,497
I am all she has.

949
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:25,091
- Come in.
- Come, my dear.

950
01:44:27,104 --> 01:44:29,095
Take a look at the
house and the householder.

951
01:44:30,774 --> 01:44:32,503
- Householder..
- My master!

952
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:35,442
- Mother!
- Let me touch your feet!

953
01:44:36,046 --> 01:44:37,638
- No.
- Leave my hand.

954
01:44:38,048 --> 01:44:40,039
- Where are your feet?
- I hid them.

955
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:42,042
- Let me get at them!
- No! - Uncle!

956
01:44:45,055 --> 01:44:47,046
Play on, little kids.

957
01:44:48,058 --> 01:44:51,050
Play and know each other since
you'll be together in life and death.

958
01:44:52,662 --> 01:44:54,061
Not life and death, simply death.

959
01:44:54,464 --> 01:44:56,056
Where are you going
leaving me alone?

960
01:44:57,067 --> 01:45:00,525
Play together alone. I'll fix
things with the Queen Mother.

961
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:02,402
Where are you running away?

962
01:45:03,407 --> 01:45:06,069
- Where are you going?
- Father!

963
01:45:07,077 --> 01:45:08,544
Where are you going?

964
01:45:09,079 --> 01:45:12,742
- Mother, no..
- I am a maiden.

965
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:15,415
- What's your name?
- Khamba (Pillar )

966
01:45:15,685 --> 01:45:18,085
- I mean Amba.
- Khamba fits better.

967
01:45:18,588 --> 01:45:20,749
Call me anything you like.

968
01:45:21,091 --> 01:45:24,583
I told you my name
now you tell me yours.

969
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:38,030
Good gracious. Bhola is innocent

970
01:45:39,042 --> 01:45:43,035
- Cut out the song?
- My song?

971
01:45:43,447 --> 01:45:46,439
I can even sing.
I'll sing for you.

972
01:45:48,051 --> 01:45:51,543
The night is dark, honey
will you stay or leave?

973
01:45:54,057 --> 01:45:55,547
You broke a bachelor's cot!

974
01:45:56,393 --> 01:46:02,332
Don't worry, sweet. My uncle
will give a sturdy cot as dowry.

975
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:04,529
- Let go.
- No, let's flirt.

976
01:46:05,068 --> 01:46:06,467
- With great difficulty
I've found you. - Queen Mother!

977
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:09,402
Sister! Let go!

978
01:46:10,073 --> 01:46:12,564
Pushing me. Want to wrestle?

979
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:15,067
I'll show you how to wrestle.

980
01:46:48,044 --> 01:46:50,478
Cruel elephant cow!

981
01:46:50,647 --> 01:46:52,046
You busted my eye!

982
01:46:52,449 --> 01:46:53,780
You called me an elephant!

983
01:46:54,384 --> 01:46:56,045
I'll gouge out the other eye!

984
01:46:57,053 --> 01:46:59,044
- Won't you get down?
- No!

985
01:47:01,057 --> 01:47:02,649
- Climb down!
- No! Queen Mother!

986
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:04,453
- Wont' marry me?
- No!

987
01:47:04,661 --> 01:47:06,060
Your Pop will marry me!

988
01:47:07,063 --> 01:47:08,655
Sister! Queen Mother!

989
01:47:13,069 --> 01:47:15,060
- Your loincloth!
- Sister!

990
01:47:18,675 --> 01:47:21,075
Save me from that elephant!

991
01:47:21,478 --> 01:47:24,072
Why are you afraid?
She only wants to marry you.

992
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:26,639
No! She's come to gouge my eyes!

993
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:30,075
- Who will marry that cow?
- You must marry her.

994
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:32,581
No! I'm a confirmed bachelor.

995
01:47:32,756 --> 01:47:34,018
My father was a bachelor.
I won't get married.

996
01:47:36,026 --> 01:47:37,516
I will!

997
01:47:39,029 --> 01:47:42,021
I'll get married but
save me from the cow!

998
01:47:43,033 --> 01:47:45,024
You're so gullible.

999
01:47:48,038 --> 01:47:49,437
My eyes...

1000
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,032
It hurts.

1001
01:47:56,379 --> 01:47:58,438
Jharna, it hurts..

1002
01:48:21,071 --> 01:48:24,063
Look into my eyes not the mirror.

1003
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,809
You are beautiful.

1004
01:48:34,017 --> 01:48:36,008
The profile set in fragrance.

1005
01:48:39,022 --> 01:48:40,614
The blush of youth on the cheeks.

1006
01:48:42,425 --> 01:48:44,620
Eyes...intoxicating eyes.

1007
01:48:45,028 --> 01:48:47,019
Lashes lowered with a flush.

1008
01:48:49,032 --> 01:48:50,761
Pink quivering lips.

1009
01:48:53,036 --> 01:48:55,027
Smile bathed in stars.

1010
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,031
Do you know what you resemble?

1011
01:49:00,043 --> 01:49:01,704
The moonlight bathed in dew.

1012
01:49:03,046 --> 01:49:05,037
A culmination of
beauty and youth.

1013
01:49:06,049 --> 01:49:07,448
I feel...

1014
01:49:12,055 --> 01:49:13,545
Don't blush.

1015
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:20,052
This is our nuptial night.

1016
01:50:04,107 --> 01:50:13,106
I wish your tresses would
flow over and engulf me

1017
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:23,123
I wish your tresses would
flow over and engulf me

1018
01:50:24,127 --> 01:50:32,125
I wish the destiny
of this night gets made

1019
01:50:48,485 --> 01:50:56,085
I've spent a part
of my life with you

1020
01:50:58,595 --> 01:51:06,092
I've spent a part
of my life with you

1021
01:51:08,104 --> 01:51:16,102
I'd love to spend the
rest of my life with you

1022
01:51:18,114 --> 01:51:25,611
I'd love to spend the
rest of my life with you

1023
01:51:36,733 --> 01:51:45,072
What is right and what is
wrong, in the eyes of the world

1024
01:51:46,743 --> 01:51:50,736
In the eyes of the world

1025
01:51:51,414 --> 01:51:54,076
What is right and what is wrong

1026
01:51:56,586 --> 01:52:05,085
I wish I couId lift
this burden from my heart

1027
01:52:06,095 --> 01:52:14,093
I wish I couId lift
this burden from my heart

1028
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:37,719
You are the one that ruined me

1029
01:52:40,063 --> 01:52:47,560
You are the one that ruined me

1030
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:58,078
I wish I could
blame another for it

1031
01:54:00,076 --> 01:54:04,069
Let not this beautiful damsel..

1032
01:54:08,084 --> 01:54:12,077
...lose her sleep

1033
01:54:16,092 --> 01:54:20,495
How nice if her eyes...

1034
01:54:25,101 --> 01:54:29,094
...would remain shut for a while

1035
01:56:31,094 --> 01:56:35,030
Your gracious beauty..

1036
01:56:37,533 --> 01:56:41,492
..wrecks havoc

1037
01:56:46,042 --> 01:56:50,035
I want it to turn hot

1038
01:56:52,648 --> 01:56:57,051
And add to the charm

1039
01:58:06,055 --> 01:58:11,049
Your heart is a looking glass

1040
01:58:13,062 --> 01:58:18,056
It reflects every deed

1041
01:58:19,068 --> 01:58:24,062
Good or bad

1042
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:34,015
Mother, it's time for your prayers.

1043
01:59:03,045 --> 01:59:04,706
What is going on?

1044
01:59:07,049 --> 01:59:09,040
Playing with strings?

1045
01:59:10,386 --> 01:59:11,717
Yes Bhanu.

1046
01:59:12,054 --> 01:59:15,046
These silent sad strings speak

1047
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:17,053
I wanted to hear them.

1048
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:22,394
I think you wanted to tell
them what is in your heart.

1049
01:59:23,065 --> 01:59:24,555
Sit down.

1050
01:59:29,739 --> 01:59:31,070
Okay, I'm here.

1051
01:59:34,076 --> 01:59:36,670
Is it not possible for you
to learn to play the sitar?

1052
01:59:38,481 --> 01:59:41,075
I can learn but it
will make things difficult.

1053
01:59:42,685 --> 01:59:44,084
With trouble, I have managed
to forgot for a short while

1054
01:59:44,687 --> 01:59:46,086
Then I won't forget.

1055
01:59:47,089 --> 01:59:48,420
What?

1056
01:59:49,091 --> 01:59:50,615
Madhavi. What else?

1057
02:00:12,515 --> 02:00:16,110
Let your pouting lips be touched

1058
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:21,112
It's nothing but some wine

1059
02:00:22,124 --> 02:00:26,117
Let your pouting lips be touched

1060
02:00:27,129 --> 02:00:31,122
It's nothing but some wine

1061
02:00:32,568 --> 02:00:36,060
From all of Nature's bounty..

1062
02:00:37,073 --> 02:00:40,668
This is the most wonderful gift

1063
02:00:41,577 --> 02:00:46,071
The delicate lips..

1064
02:01:01,497 --> 02:01:05,763
Don't waste precious moments of life

1065
02:01:06,102 --> 02:01:10,095
Blushing and flushing with timidity

1066
02:01:16,112 --> 02:01:20,105
Don't waste precious moments of life

1067
02:01:21,117 --> 02:01:24,780
Blushing and flushing with timidity

1068
02:01:26,455 --> 02:01:30,118
This is a message from..

1069
02:01:31,127 --> 02:01:35,393
The heart that pulses with amour

1070
02:02:05,694 --> 02:02:09,562
The world loves to accuse..

1071
02:02:10,099 --> 02:02:14,502
...the good of being bad

1072
02:02:20,109 --> 02:02:24,102
The world loves to accuse..

1073
02:02:25,114 --> 02:02:28,606
...the good of being bad

1074
02:02:30,119 --> 02:02:33,111
Consider booze glorious

1075
02:02:34,056 --> 02:02:38,550
Even if it is bad mouthed

1076
02:03:02,084 --> 02:03:03,608
Why do you consume this venom?

1077
02:03:05,087 --> 02:03:06,554
I drink..

1078
02:03:09,091 --> 02:03:10,581
So that I can be devastated.

1079
02:03:14,096 --> 02:03:17,088
When life turns to be a burden..

1080
02:03:19,101 --> 02:03:20,762
One has to turn to it for support.

1081
02:03:21,604 --> 02:03:23,094
What sorrow do you have?

1082
02:03:24,106 --> 02:03:26,506
Tell me. I will share everything.

1083
02:03:29,111 --> 02:03:31,102
You tell me...

1084
02:03:32,114 --> 02:03:33,706
Have I committed a
grave sin by marrying you?

1085
02:03:34,049 --> 02:03:38,543
That father has stopped
sending me money from Africa.

1086
02:03:44,059 --> 02:03:47,551
If I am unable to pay the
installment of 20000 by tomorrow..

1087
02:03:48,063 --> 02:03:49,394
Everything will be auctioned.

1088
02:03:49,565 --> 02:03:50,793
I will lose face.

1089
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,628
Twenty thousand..

1090
02:03:54,069 --> 02:03:55,502
I have my ornaments.

1091
02:03:58,073 --> 02:04:00,564
- You can take..
- No.

1092
02:04:01,076 --> 02:04:02,668
The ornaments of a married
woman can never be pawned.

1093
02:04:03,078 --> 02:04:04,568
Don't ever say it.

1094
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:07,071
Then..should I go to the palace?

1095
02:04:08,083 --> 02:04:10,415
I am confident His Highness
won't turn me down.

1096
02:04:12,087 --> 02:04:16,080
Yes..I'm not asking for alms.

1097
02:04:16,425 --> 02:04:17,756
I'm only asking for
a loan for a few days.

1098
02:04:18,093 --> 02:04:19,424
I'll return it the
moment the money comes.

1099
02:04:21,096 --> 02:04:22,495
Listen..

1100
02:04:23,499 --> 02:04:27,094
Promise me that henceforth..

1101
02:04:28,504 --> 02:04:30,597
Madhavi will share your
sorrows, not alcohol.

1102
02:04:32,107 --> 02:04:33,540
I promise you.

1103
02:04:36,712 --> 02:04:38,043
No more liquor.

1104
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,789
Madhavi? When did you come?

1105
02:04:53,462 --> 02:04:55,054
I need to talk to you.

1106
02:04:56,065 --> 02:04:57,555
Sit down.

1107
02:05:00,069 --> 02:05:01,502
Why do you appear lost?

1108
02:05:02,071 --> 02:05:03,561
Has Moti sent a message?

1109
02:05:04,073 --> 02:05:06,064
Yes..No.

1110
02:05:09,078 --> 02:05:10,477
Tell me.

1111
02:05:10,813 --> 02:05:12,075
Don't hesitate to tell me.

1112
02:05:13,549 --> 02:05:16,074
He has negotiated for a timber mill.

1113
02:05:16,418 --> 02:05:17,749
That's good.

1114
02:05:19,688 --> 02:05:21,087
He has to pay some advance.

1115
02:05:21,824 --> 02:05:23,086
Rs. 20000

1116
02:05:26,095 --> 02:05:31,431
- Yes?
- His father hasn't sent the money.

1117
02:05:32,101 --> 02:05:34,695
- So Moti sent you..
- No.

1118
02:05:35,037 --> 02:05:37,505
He didn't say anything.
I suggested it.

1119
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:41,032
I thought of talking to you.

1120
02:05:43,045 --> 02:05:44,376
Consider it a loan.

1121
02:05:45,047 --> 02:05:48,039
He said he'll return it as soon
as his money comes from Africa.

1122
02:05:49,385 --> 02:05:50,716
I'll drop you back.

1123
02:05:51,053 --> 02:05:52,384
I have the car.

1124
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:05,662
How much did you give her?

1125
02:06:07,069 --> 02:06:08,400
20000.

1126
02:06:09,071 --> 02:06:10,732
20000! For what?

1127
02:06:11,073 --> 02:06:13,064
Why don't you bequeath
the palace to her?

1128
02:06:16,078 --> 02:06:17,739
God forbid that such a
day should come in her life!

1129
02:06:36,031 --> 02:06:37,521
It's midnight.

1130
02:06:38,033 --> 02:06:39,364
Yes.

1131
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:46,439
Does he come late every night?

1132
02:06:47,710 --> 02:06:49,041
Does he work very hard?

1133
02:06:50,446 --> 02:06:54,041
Yes. Now you must leave.
Your wife must be waiting.

1134
02:06:55,718 --> 02:06:57,049
You too are waiting.

1135
02:06:59,722 --> 02:07:02,054
Women spend half their lives waiting.

1136
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:07,722
May I ask you something?

1137
02:07:08,063 --> 02:07:09,724
Are you happy?

1138
02:07:11,066 --> 02:07:13,398
Yes. Very happy.

1139
02:07:14,069 --> 02:07:19,063
Should I tell your baby god that
Madhavi is happy in her new world?

1140
02:07:21,076 --> 02:07:23,544
He is omni potent.
He knows everything.

1141
02:07:25,481 --> 02:07:28,746
A beautiful girl..

1142
02:07:33,088 --> 02:07:36,023
A beautiful girl beside

1143
02:07:38,627 --> 02:07:42,688
Me and some booze

1144
02:07:47,035 --> 02:07:50,436
No sorrows

1145
02:07:53,041 --> 02:07:57,034
No sorrows

1146
02:07:59,047 --> 02:08:03,040
Even if life is miserable

1147
02:08:48,030 --> 02:08:49,361
Come with me.

1148
02:08:49,765 --> 02:08:51,027
Back to the palace.

1149
02:08:51,767 --> 02:08:53,291
This is hell not a home.

1150
02:08:54,036 --> 02:08:57,528
My heaven lies beside him.

1151
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:59,530
My utopia.

1152
02:09:01,043 --> 02:09:05,036
God's doorstep is hell
without him beside me.

1153
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:10,041
Why do you want to ruin
your life in this hell?

1154
02:09:10,385 --> 02:09:11,716
Don't say that.

1155
02:09:12,654 --> 02:09:15,054
A husband obtained with the
fire and priest as witness..

1156
02:09:16,058 --> 02:09:18,549
However he be, he is god.

1157
02:09:19,728 --> 02:09:21,059
My God.

1158
02:09:33,075 --> 02:09:34,474
This cheque..

1159
02:09:35,077 --> 02:09:36,408
...is yours.

1160
02:09:37,079 --> 02:09:38,569
It came back from the bank.

1161
02:09:41,083 --> 02:09:43,074
The cheque I issued on
the basis of this cheque..

1162
02:09:43,585 --> 02:09:46,486
You can guess what
will happen to it.

1163
02:09:49,091 --> 02:09:51,082
And how must I thank you..

1164
02:09:52,094 --> 02:09:53,584
You can advise me about that too.

1165
02:09:54,096 --> 02:09:56,087
I have a lot to tell you.

1166
02:09:56,765 --> 02:09:58,096
But I don't want to.

1167
02:09:59,101 --> 02:10:05,097
I'd already given you a cheque
of 20000 to pay the mill advance.

1168
02:10:06,108 --> 02:10:08,099
How and where you spent that amount..

1169
02:10:09,111 --> 02:10:10,510
I'm ashamed to talk of it.

1170
02:10:12,114 --> 02:10:13,706
You are our son-in-law.

1171
02:10:14,116 --> 02:10:16,107
Don't take undue advantage.

1172
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:20,111
Thanks for considering
me the son-in-law.

1173
02:10:22,124 --> 02:10:26,117
But Your Highness
don't cross your limits!

1174
02:10:27,129 --> 02:10:29,597
I haven't asked you for alms.

1175
02:10:30,465 --> 02:10:31,796
I took a loan!

1176
02:10:33,135 --> 02:10:34,659
Every penny will be paid back.

1177
02:10:37,072 --> 02:10:39,063
What I did, was no favour.

1178
02:10:39,541 --> 02:10:42,066
But I expect something from you.

1179
02:10:43,412 --> 02:10:45,073
Those that stay on the
right path in youth..

1180
02:10:46,081 --> 02:10:50,074
They do a favour to themselves
and their families, not others.

1181
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:52,751
Here are the deed papers of the mill.

1182
02:10:54,089 --> 02:10:57,081
I've negotiated after
paying 20000 as advance.

1183
02:10:58,093 --> 02:11:00,584
But..these are in Madhavi's name.

1184
02:11:01,096 --> 02:11:02,586
The factory will be in her name.

1185
02:11:03,098 --> 02:11:04,588
You will only run it.

1186
02:11:17,112 --> 02:11:18,773
I request leave.

1187
02:11:20,115 --> 02:11:22,379
I won't let you leave
without drinking tea.

1188
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:27,384
Sister-in-law, today I don't
feel like having tea here.

1189
02:11:28,123 --> 02:11:31,115
Don't be disheartened.

1190
02:11:34,062 --> 02:11:35,552
I heard everything.

1191
02:11:37,065 --> 02:11:38,623
We are in the same boat.

1192
02:11:40,068 --> 02:11:41,558
We're travelling together.

1193
02:11:43,739 --> 02:11:47,402
The only difference is that
I know the depth of the ocean.

1194
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:50,072
And you know nothing.

1195
02:11:51,079 --> 02:11:52,546
I don't get that.

1196
02:11:54,082 --> 02:11:56,073
In a short time,
you'll understand.

1197
02:11:57,085 --> 02:11:59,076
what I have, was always Madhavi's.

1198
02:12:00,489 --> 02:12:03,083
And now what should be
yours, is also for Madhavi.

1199
02:12:05,093 --> 02:12:06,583
Madhavi is so lucky.

1200
02:12:09,765 --> 02:12:11,096
I'd like another cup of tea.

1201
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:15,092
Sure. I too will tell
you something else.

1202
02:12:17,773 --> 02:12:19,104
What is wrong with you today?

1203
02:12:19,441 --> 02:12:20,772
Are you in your senses?

1204
02:12:22,110 --> 02:12:23,600
I am in my senses.

1205
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:26,111
I haven't had a drink.

1206
02:12:28,450 --> 02:12:31,783
I am sorry that the infidel
did not appreciate you.

1207
02:12:33,388 --> 02:12:35,652
He left you to be tormented for life.

1208
02:12:36,458 --> 02:12:38,551
What..what are you saying?

1209
02:12:39,728 --> 02:12:41,059
Bhanu told me everything.

1210
02:12:42,664 --> 02:12:45,064
The silly girl thought finding
out about your love for prince..

1211
02:12:47,069 --> 02:12:48,730
I would be raving mad.

1212
02:12:50,072 --> 02:12:53,064
But I am not so narrow minded.

1213
02:12:53,408 --> 02:12:55,069
For God's sake, stop it.

1214
02:12:55,343 --> 02:12:57,072
This is a sin!

1215
02:12:58,080 --> 02:12:59,570
Silly girl, there's
nothing to fear.

1216
02:13:01,683 --> 02:13:03,082
Life is a trade.

1217
02:13:03,418 --> 02:13:05,750
And love is its' currency.

1218
02:13:08,090 --> 02:13:12,083
He could not marry you because
you were the poor clerk's daughter.

1219
02:13:14,096 --> 02:13:17,827
But now he is bound by his heart.

1220
02:13:19,101 --> 02:13:21,831
And he can shower everything on you.

1221
02:13:23,105 --> 02:13:27,599
And you can steal all he
has in the guise of love.

1222
02:13:29,111 --> 02:13:31,102
Wealth, possessions..

1223
02:13:32,114 --> 02:13:34,548
Assets, money.

1224
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:37,712
Money! Is that all
that matters to you?

1225
02:13:38,053 --> 02:13:40,715
Duty, goodness, evil

1226
02:13:41,056 --> 02:13:42,648
These mean nothing to you
as compared to wealth!

1227
02:13:43,058 --> 02:13:46,050
Wealth makes you think
of this serious sin!

1228
02:13:47,062 --> 02:13:51,522
You didn't hesitate to
doubt your wife's chastity!

1229
02:13:52,734 --> 02:13:56,465
When those who should be ashamed
felt no shame, why should I?

1230
02:13:58,073 --> 02:13:59,563
Then do as I say.

1231
02:14:00,075 --> 02:14:02,066
Take me to the market
and auction me off!

1232
02:14:04,079 --> 02:14:05,740
Life is a trade.

1233
02:14:06,081 --> 02:14:08,072
And love is its' currency.

1234
02:14:09,084 --> 02:14:10,745
when both are missing in me..

1235
02:14:11,086 --> 02:14:13,077
What will you do with it
if not auction it off?

1236
02:14:14,089 --> 02:14:16,080
What will you do?

1237
02:14:57,065 --> 02:14:58,430
Father!

1238
02:15:00,068 --> 02:15:02,059
You didn't inform me that
you were coming from Africa.

1239
02:15:30,098 --> 02:15:32,498
Son...son?

1240
02:15:34,035 --> 02:15:36,026
I hear that Moti's father
has come from Africa.

1241
02:15:37,038 --> 02:15:39,029
- I also heard that.
- You didn't go to see him?

1242
02:15:41,042 --> 02:15:42,475
I couldn't go.

1243
02:15:43,545 --> 02:15:46,378
He might take offense. After
all we're from the bride's family.

1244
02:15:46,648 --> 02:15:48,047
Invite him for tea.

1245
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:50,040
Very well.

1246
02:15:54,055 --> 02:15:56,046
Do you recognise me?

1247
02:15:57,058 --> 02:16:01,051
You do look familiar
but I can't place you.

1248
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:06,057
But father, you identified
the Queen Mother at sight.

1249
02:16:08,069 --> 02:16:09,661
The servant recognises
before the master can.

1250
02:16:10,071 --> 02:16:12,062
- Servant?
- Yes.

1251
02:16:14,075 --> 02:16:17,636
Isn't my daughter-in-law the
daughter of your clerk, Banwarilal?

1252
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:20,070
Yes, his daughter, Madhvi.

1253
02:16:21,082 --> 02:16:23,550
- And Rajesh too is..
- No!

1254
02:16:24,085 --> 02:16:25,484
What are you saying?

1255
02:16:26,087 --> 02:16:29,079
The secret that lies hidden
in your heart for decades.

1256
02:16:30,091 --> 02:16:32,821
- Your son is Kalu..
- Don't take his name!

1257
02:16:34,029 --> 02:16:36,020
He was a demon not a man.

1258
02:16:37,365 --> 02:16:38,696
Treacherous gardener...

1259
02:16:43,772 --> 02:16:48,539
Do you recall the day Kalu
fell and grovelled at your feet?

1260
02:16:49,044 --> 02:16:51,035
Begged you for mercy.

1261
02:16:52,047 --> 02:16:55,039
Queen Mother, have mercy on me.

1262
02:16:55,717 --> 02:16:57,378
Have some pity!

1263
02:16:58,053 --> 02:17:00,544
For God's sake, save my child.

1264
02:17:01,056 --> 02:17:04,457
He's my only child!
My only son!

1265
02:17:05,060 --> 02:17:08,052
No, Kalicharan. Your
son committed a murder.

1266
02:17:09,064 --> 02:17:10,793
The murder of a poor widow's son.

1267
02:17:11,399 --> 02:17:13,492
One who can slit a
throat for a gold chain...

1268
02:17:14,469 --> 02:17:16,494
I can't save his neck
from the gallows.

1269
02:17:28,083 --> 02:17:30,415
Then rage built up in
Kalu the gardener's heart.

1270
02:17:31,086 --> 02:17:34,021
His Highness had
only one son, Rajesh.

1271
02:17:35,690 --> 02:17:37,521
That night when everyone
was fast asleep..

1272
02:17:38,293 --> 02:17:41,023
Kalu jumped into
the lake with Rajesh.

1273
02:17:41,529 --> 02:17:43,019
The palace was agog!

1274
02:17:43,631 --> 02:17:47,032
Guns were brought out.
Hounds sniffed the streets.

1275
02:17:47,769 --> 02:17:49,498
But they couldn't nab Kalu.

1276
02:17:50,505 --> 02:17:53,030
Then the King felt threatened.

1277
02:17:54,042 --> 02:17:57,034
Government would confiscate
his kingdom if he had no heir.

1278
02:17:57,779 --> 02:18:01,715
The Queen Mother followed him
and wandered all around town.

1279
02:18:03,451 --> 02:18:06,045
Because it was the king's desire..

1280
02:18:07,055 --> 02:18:11,321
Banwarilal their faithful clerk put
his son in the Queen Mother's arms.

1281
02:18:12,394 --> 02:18:16,057
So that this would remain a secret.

1282
02:18:17,065 --> 02:18:20,057
Forever. Isn't that so?

1283
02:18:20,535 --> 02:18:22,059
Moti is not my son.

1284
02:18:23,071 --> 02:18:26,063
Consumed by vengeance,
you're playing a trick!

1285
02:18:26,808 --> 02:18:28,742
Mistress, don't hide the truth.

1286
02:18:29,411 --> 02:18:32,744
Here is the locket which
carries your memory even today.

1287
02:18:36,017 --> 02:18:40,010
The quirks of fate.
Moti is the true heir..

1288
02:18:41,022 --> 02:18:42,512
....is like a beggar
waiting for alms.

1289
02:18:43,525 --> 02:18:47,689
And Rajesh the son of a clerk
has turned into the master.

1290
02:18:48,363 --> 02:18:50,024
Brother!

1291
02:19:00,041 --> 02:19:02,771
Accept it. What
vengeance I have wrecked!

1292
02:19:03,478 --> 02:19:07,039
An innocent boy whom my company
turned into a gambler and alcoholic.

1293
02:19:07,315 --> 02:19:08,646
A derelict!

1294
02:19:09,050 --> 02:19:10,517
Revenge?

1295
02:19:11,052 --> 02:19:12,383
Get out!

1296
02:19:13,054 --> 02:19:14,715
Get out of my sight!

1297
02:19:15,723 --> 02:19:17,054
Go!

1298
02:19:21,062 --> 02:19:24,054
You didn't take
revenge from my parents.

1299
02:19:26,067 --> 02:19:27,557
But from innocent me.

1300
02:19:29,070 --> 02:19:32,062
Today after an exile of 30 years..

1301
02:19:33,074 --> 02:19:35,565
I have returned to my capital.

1302
02:19:40,081 --> 02:19:42,481
Go! Get out of here!

1303
02:20:12,614 --> 02:20:14,377
Please don't interfere in this.

1304
02:20:16,117 --> 02:20:17,584
My wish will be done.

1305
02:20:18,119 --> 02:20:19,711
I am the master of this palace.

1306
02:20:20,121 --> 02:20:22,112
How can a mother tolerate
injustice done by the master?

1307
02:20:24,125 --> 02:20:25,786
The one I have always
considered my son..

1308
02:20:26,528 --> 02:20:28,120
How can I make him a beggar?

1309
02:20:30,131 --> 02:20:31,792
Then give him his
father's old position.

1310
02:20:32,867 --> 02:20:34,562
He can be our clerk.

1311
02:20:35,537 --> 02:20:37,061
He can live in his father's quarter.

1312
02:20:37,805 --> 02:20:39,067
I will permit that.

1313
02:20:41,476 --> 02:20:43,068
He can issue me cheques that bounce.

1314
02:20:44,078 --> 02:20:46,069
But I am giving him a real job.

1315
02:20:46,814 --> 02:20:48,076
You are very generous.

1316
02:20:50,585 --> 02:20:52,075
Are you pulling my leg?

1317
02:20:53,087 --> 02:20:54,748
How can the servant
pull the master's leg?

1318
02:20:57,091 --> 02:21:01,084
I am so attached to this
palace, mother and Madhavi..

1319
02:21:02,096 --> 02:21:03,757
I can give up my life for them.

1320
02:21:05,099 --> 02:21:06,430
Come here.

1321
02:21:12,106 --> 02:21:19,512
Sitting on this very chair, if you
hadn't been rude and impolite to me..

1322
02:21:21,115 --> 02:21:25,449
I would make you sit
beside me and drink whisky.

1323
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:27,610
Watch the nautch girls dance.

1324
02:21:28,456 --> 02:21:30,447
Show you the beauty of youth.

1325
02:21:43,471 --> 02:21:44,802
Mother...

1326
02:21:47,075 --> 02:21:49,066
How long will you stay
hungry and thirsty?

1327
02:21:50,545 --> 02:21:55,073
No dear, now I don't feel like
drinking the water in this house.

1328
02:21:57,085 --> 02:21:58,746
The state this house is in.

1329
02:22:03,358 --> 02:22:05,758
Today the future of the
family is destroying it.

1330
02:22:07,095 --> 02:22:10,587
He is decimating the family
honour in bottles of alcohol.

1331
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:14,565
I don't know what destiny wants.

1332
02:22:15,703 --> 02:22:19,605
Waiting for destiny to take
its' course won't change it.

1333
02:22:21,776 --> 02:22:25,109
The good deeds of today will
form the destiny of tomorrow.

1334
02:22:26,781 --> 02:22:29,113
What will happen to this
lineage if you lose hope?

1335
02:22:30,118 --> 02:22:31,608
How will he be transformed?

1336
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,712
That is what I had thought.

1337
02:22:35,556 --> 02:22:38,047
But I don't think that
day will dawn in my life.

1338
02:22:40,061 --> 02:22:41,790
He turned Rajesh into a beggar.

1339
02:22:43,064 --> 02:22:44,395
I quietly bore it.

1340
02:22:45,066 --> 02:22:46,556
He came drunk into this house.

1341
02:22:47,068 --> 02:22:50,060
I beseeched him to
keep the family name.

1342
02:22:52,073 --> 02:22:53,472
He didn't pay heed
to anything I said.

1343
02:22:54,676 --> 02:22:58,476
But this palace, pure as a
temple is being defiled by whores.

1344
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:00,079
I can't bear that!

1345
02:23:01,082 --> 02:23:04,074
How much! He did everything
and I stoically tolerated it!

1346
02:23:07,088 --> 02:23:08,578
This is our duty.

1347
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:14,084
You once told me, woman and
the earth have to bear a lot.

1348
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:17,092
They have to endure a lot.

1349
02:23:26,107 --> 02:23:29,543
No mistress. I created
problems for this family.

1350
02:23:30,611 --> 02:23:32,602
I destroyed the peace and
happiness of this family.

1351
02:23:34,048 --> 02:23:36,039
I should be punished for my sins.

1352
02:23:38,052 --> 02:23:39,644
You are not to be blamed.

1353
02:23:41,456 --> 02:23:43,048
Destiny can't be evaded.

1354
02:23:45,059 --> 02:23:47,050
We are puppets in the hands of fate.

1355
02:23:54,068 --> 02:23:58,562
You have shown me
the light in the dark

1356
02:24:01,075 --> 02:24:05,068
Who has lit lamps..?

1357
02:24:12,086 --> 02:24:15,578
How dare you come to
the temple doors, drunk!

1358
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:20,083
Shameless! You should have
known it's my lord's birthday!

1359
02:24:21,095 --> 02:24:22,426
Birthday?

1360
02:24:24,098 --> 02:24:26,828
Nobody ever celebrated my birthday.

1361
02:24:28,102 --> 02:24:33,096
Then why do you celebrate
the birthday of this stone idol?

1362
02:24:34,041 --> 02:24:37,033
Fear God. Don't show Him disrespect.

1363
02:24:40,047 --> 02:24:42,038
Do you mean this God?

1364
02:24:42,383 --> 02:24:43,714
This God?

1365
02:24:45,653 --> 02:24:49,054
Someday you should have asked him..

1366
02:24:51,058 --> 02:24:54,789
What has he done for your son?

1367
02:24:58,566 --> 02:25:02,058
Thakur Udham Singh's son..

1368
02:25:04,071 --> 02:25:06,062
....was raised by a measly gardener..

1369
02:25:07,074 --> 02:25:10,066
....for 30 years.

1370
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:17,074
There he was turned into a
demon instead of a human being.

1371
02:25:19,487 --> 02:25:24,481
A sweet poison was pumped
into his innocent veins.

1372
02:25:26,093 --> 02:25:28,084
Instead of his mother's lap..

1373
02:25:29,497 --> 02:25:31,692
...he was supported by
brothels of prostitutes.

1374
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:35,025
At that time, where was your God?

1375
02:25:37,038 --> 02:25:40,030
Ask him! Ask him...

1376
02:25:45,046 --> 02:25:49,039
Now I will believe in the God...

1377
02:25:50,551 --> 02:25:52,382
Who drinks like me.

1378
02:25:54,055 --> 02:25:56,455
Sings and dances..

1379
02:25:58,059 --> 02:26:02,052
How can I believe in
this God made of stone?

1380
02:26:03,064 --> 02:26:04,554
You call my God; a stone idol!

1381
02:26:05,066 --> 02:26:08,058
You will make some whore
wear the beads I pray with!

1382
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:10,560
Now I can't live here!

1383
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:12,733
Now the devil resides here!

1384
02:26:13,074 --> 02:26:14,598
Dear God!

1385
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,071
I can't bear anymore.

1386
02:26:26,487 --> 02:26:27,818
I am leaving.

1387
02:26:28,589 --> 02:26:32,582
Be warned, someday you'll cry
before this God made of stone!

1388
02:26:33,094 --> 02:26:35,358
You will grovel and beg for mercy!

1389
02:26:38,032 --> 02:26:40,523
Sinner! You should
have died on birth!

1390
02:26:44,038 --> 02:26:45,528
How can I die?

1391
02:26:47,041 --> 02:26:49,032
As if I can die..

1392
02:26:53,047 --> 02:26:54,571
How can I die?

1393
02:27:00,054 --> 02:27:05,651
All this time, I have been dying.

1394
02:27:07,061 --> 02:27:12,055
Only now have I learnt to live.

1395
02:27:16,070 --> 02:27:18,061
Only now have I learnt to live.

1396
02:27:37,024 --> 02:27:39,015
The witness has to sign here.

1397
02:27:42,029 --> 02:27:43,519
What is going on?

1398
02:27:44,031 --> 02:27:45,521
The Queen Mother
has made a new will.

1399
02:27:46,033 --> 02:27:49,434
According to it, you get
the land near the lake.

1400
02:27:50,037 --> 02:27:51,527
That land?

1401
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,031
Mother, how is that possible?

1402
02:27:57,044 --> 02:27:58,534
I have given birth to Moti.

1403
02:28:00,314 --> 02:28:03,374
But my child I have nurtured
you with great love and affection.

1404
02:28:05,653 --> 02:28:08,053
When a brother is unjust to another...

1405
02:28:09,657 --> 02:28:11,056
How can a mother quietly bear it?

1406
02:28:12,059 --> 02:28:15,551
But you were going to build
a temple on that land..

1407
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:19,730
No, my son.

1408
02:28:20,801 --> 02:28:25,465
My God desires that
your house be built there.

1409
02:28:34,015 --> 02:28:37,280
Bhola came with the message
that mother is very unwell.

1410
02:28:37,685 --> 02:28:39,016
Won't you come to see her?

1411
02:28:40,354 --> 02:28:43,346
She only considers Rajesh her son.

1412
02:28:45,026 --> 02:28:46,687
What will I do there?

1413
02:28:47,361 --> 02:28:50,023
At least come and ask her
mother what do you want?

1414
02:28:52,033 --> 02:28:53,694
I know what she wants.

1415
02:28:55,369 --> 02:28:57,360
But what can I do?

1416
02:28:58,039 --> 02:29:01,031
I have just one cure for every ill.

1417
02:29:03,044 --> 02:29:06,036
Will anyone drink it
because I ask them to?

1418
02:29:12,053 --> 02:29:13,714
Where is Madhavi?

1419
02:29:15,056 --> 02:29:16,387
Mother, I am right here.

1420
02:29:20,561 --> 02:29:23,655
I wanted to see you
and Moti together.

1421
02:29:27,401 --> 02:29:28,800
His wish...

1422
02:29:31,472 --> 02:29:35,067
Women and the earth
have to tolerate a lot.

1423
02:29:47,088 --> 02:29:48,749
Do you see this lamp?

1424
02:29:50,758 --> 02:29:53,090
It burns bit by bit.

1425
02:29:55,096 --> 02:29:58,691
The smoke that rises from
its' heart turns to kohl

1426
02:30:01,102 --> 02:30:03,832
It adorns somebody's eyes.

1427
02:30:06,107 --> 02:30:09,099
Kohl isn't the soot of its' heart.

1428
02:30:11,112 --> 02:30:13,103
It is the essence of its' glow

1429
02:30:15,116 --> 02:30:17,380
A symbol of its' love.

1430
02:30:21,388 --> 02:30:23,856
A woman's life is akin to the lamp.

1431
02:30:26,127 --> 02:30:28,118
By her sacrifice and renunciation...

1432
02:30:29,730 --> 02:30:31,789
She turns her home into heaven.

1433
02:30:34,635 --> 02:30:37,399
The lives of both are for others.

1434
02:30:44,678 --> 02:30:50,082
Fearless Kabira and Ram...

1435
02:30:52,086 --> 02:30:55,578
The lamp of mankind
at your doorstep

1436
02:30:58,092 --> 02:31:03,086
The lamp is extinguished
when the oil reduces

1437
02:31:04,698 --> 02:31:08,099
You will fall in a deep slumber

1438
02:31:23,117 --> 02:31:26,109
Let your gathering..

1439
02:31:28,122 --> 02:31:32,456
...always be illuminated by candles

1440
02:31:35,396 --> 02:31:40,060
I wish this night...

1441
02:31:42,069 --> 02:31:46,403
...is spent in wakefulness

1442
02:31:51,478 --> 02:31:54,743
There is no penance
greater than truth

1443
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:07,083
The Lord resides in..

1444
02:32:09,096 --> 02:32:12,088
...one whose heart is pure

1445
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:27,105
Where will I find peace..

1446
02:32:29,116 --> 02:32:33,712
Away from your company

1447
02:32:37,057 --> 02:32:41,460
I would appreciate it..

1448
02:32:43,063 --> 02:32:47,397
If somebody would
let me know about myself

1449
02:32:51,572 --> 02:32:56,066
Mortals don't exist before God

1450
02:32:58,412 --> 02:33:02,075
Now God is with me
but my self is no more

1451
02:33:04,084 --> 02:33:08,817
The darkness is clearing up

1452
02:33:11,091 --> 02:33:16,085
Though the lamp has been blown off

1453
02:33:26,707 --> 02:33:31,110
The morning that is fated...

1454
02:33:34,048 --> 02:33:38,542
...to be filled with separation

1455
02:33:42,456 --> 02:33:53,060
It would be best if one were
to die before that morning dawns

1456
02:33:56,070 --> 02:34:01,064
One should die...

1457
02:34:17,091 --> 02:34:19,082
- Mother...
- Who..?

1458
02:34:49,056 --> 02:34:52,048
Hail Lord Rama

1459
02:35:15,082 --> 02:35:16,572
Without my permission...

1460
02:35:18,085 --> 02:35:21,077
Who are you to take my
mother to the cemetery?

1461
02:35:23,757 --> 02:35:25,088
She was the queen of this palace.

1462
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:28,751
She was my mother not yours!

1463
02:35:30,097 --> 02:35:31,496
Yes.

1464
02:35:31,698 --> 02:35:34,030
Your mother was the
queen of the palace.

1465
02:35:36,036 --> 02:35:39,028
The queen who breathed her
last in her servant's hut.

1466
02:35:42,042 --> 02:35:48,038
The unlucky mother who eyes turned
to stone waiting for her son.

1467
02:35:49,049 --> 02:35:54,043
The last tear that fell from
her eyes was Moti(a pearl)

1468
02:35:56,056 --> 02:36:00,789
Falling from her lashes, it said
her son should die of shame!

1469
02:36:07,067 --> 02:36:08,557
All of you are betrayers.

1470
02:36:09,069 --> 02:36:10,661
You planned this.

1471
02:36:12,072 --> 02:36:14,506
You forced my mother
to sign on a fake will.

1472
02:36:15,075 --> 02:36:17,566
All of you want to turn me
into a beggar for life!

1473
02:36:19,079 --> 02:36:23,072
Cruel people. overnight you
consigned my mother to flames.

1474
02:36:24,084 --> 02:36:25,483
And didn't even inform me!.

1475
02:36:25,752 --> 02:36:28,414
Should the dead body of that woeful
mother have waited on the road..

1476
02:36:29,089 --> 02:36:32,081
For her drunken son to come to his
senses and take her to be cremated!

1477
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:39,294
Who knows if you will
be sober when I die or not.

1478
02:36:40,033 --> 02:36:42,763
Whether you will remember
to carry Madhavi's remains.

1479
02:36:44,304 --> 02:36:45,771
I have a feeling..

1480
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:51,704
Like mother, I too will leave
the world pining to see you.

1481
02:36:52,379 --> 02:36:54,040
Pining for you...

1482
02:36:55,048 --> 02:36:57,039
That's enough! I don't
want to hear another word!

1483
02:36:58,051 --> 02:37:02,044
You tell me whether you can
prove mother's will to be fake.

1484
02:37:02,389 --> 02:37:03,720
Will you do it or not?

1485
02:37:04,057 --> 02:37:05,524
That won't be possible.

1486
02:37:05,659 --> 02:37:08,389
You forget that you are my servant!

1487
02:37:09,062 --> 02:37:10,723
You will have to obey me!

1488
02:37:11,064 --> 02:37:12,725
I am paid to do my work.

1489
02:37:14,067 --> 02:37:16,058
I haven't sold my soul to you!

1490
02:37:17,671 --> 02:37:21,072
You are probably forgetting
that one of the two witnesses..

1491
02:37:22,075 --> 02:37:25,067
...who signed the will of your
mother is your wife, Madhavi.

1492
02:37:25,579 --> 02:37:27,069
Get out!

1493
02:37:33,687 --> 02:37:35,348
I'm glad I saw you.

1494
02:37:38,025 --> 02:37:42,018
Ingrate! You forced my
mother to sign a fake will!

1495
02:37:43,697 --> 02:37:45,028
Don't get excited.

1496
02:37:46,033 --> 02:37:47,694
Your mother herself signed the will.

1497
02:37:48,035 --> 02:37:49,502
I know everything!

1498
02:37:50,037 --> 02:37:52,028
Give me the will.

1499
02:37:52,639 --> 02:37:54,038
No way!

1500
02:37:55,042 --> 02:37:58,307
I won't let the last wish of
that angel remain unfulfilled!

1501
02:37:58,545 --> 02:38:00,035
Rascal! You argue with me!

1502
02:38:02,049 --> 02:38:03,448
Don't challenge me!

1503
02:38:49,029 --> 02:38:51,020
Get away! For God's sake, let go!

1504
02:38:51,698 --> 02:38:53,359
What is wrong with both of you?

1505
02:38:55,035 --> 02:38:57,026
I won't spare you!

1506
02:39:06,046 --> 02:39:07,638
- Let go! I say..
- No!

1507
02:39:09,049 --> 02:39:11,449
Leave me...get out of my way!

1508
02:39:12,052 --> 02:39:13,644
Today he can't escape me!

1509
02:39:14,054 --> 02:39:16,386
- No!
- He can't get away!

1510
02:39:19,059 --> 02:39:21,050
- The consequences will be terrible!
- Let go!

1511
02:39:22,062 --> 02:39:23,393
Leave her!

1512
02:39:31,071 --> 02:39:32,504
For God's sake..!

1513
02:39:37,077 --> 02:39:40,069
- Move away!
- Madhavi, get out!

1514
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:42,070
No, no...!

1515
02:40:17,617 --> 02:40:19,107
This is so terrible...

1516
02:41:41,067 --> 02:41:45,060
Your heart is a looking glass

1517
02:41:47,073 --> 02:41:51,407
Good deeds and evil..

1518
02:41:52,078 --> 02:41:56,071
It reflects everything

1519
02:41:57,083 --> 02:42:01,076
Your heart is a looking glass

1520
02:42:10,096 --> 02:42:17,434
The mind gives rise
to joys and sorrows

1521
02:42:20,774 --> 02:42:25,108
You can't hide
anything from the heart

1522
02:42:26,112 --> 02:42:28,842
The soul has a thousand eyes

1523
02:42:32,118 --> 02:42:35,554
You can escape from the world

1524
02:42:37,057 --> 02:42:41,050
But you can't get
away from the spirit

1525
02:43:01,581 --> 02:43:06,484
Ten..I saw both of them
were losing control to fury.

1526
02:43:09,089 --> 02:43:12,820
I got frightened seeing
the gun in my husband's hand.

1527
02:43:16,429 --> 02:43:20,763
I was scared of some serious
outbreak of the quarrel.

1528
02:43:22,102 --> 02:43:24,434
I ran and caught the
muzzle of the gun.

1529
02:43:26,773 --> 02:43:28,104
My husband tried to pull it away.

1530
02:43:30,110 --> 02:43:34,706
In the struggle that ensued
suddenly there was a boom.

1531
02:43:36,716 --> 02:43:38,047
And I...fainted.

1532
02:43:39,386 --> 02:43:41,650
My husband can't be blamed for it.

1533
02:43:42,455 --> 02:43:46,050
Inspector, I know...

1534
02:43:47,060 --> 02:43:49,460
He loves me deeply.

1535
02:43:53,400 --> 02:44:00,067
Any woman would be proud..
to possess such a husband..

1536
02:44:04,077 --> 02:44:07,069
We were only able to record
this much when she fainted.

1537
02:44:07,514 --> 02:44:09,072
She still hasn't
regained consciousness.

1538
02:44:12,819 --> 02:44:19,816
I feel like mother I too
will die pining for you.

1539
02:44:21,094 --> 02:44:22,561
Die pining for you...

1540
02:44:51,057 --> 02:44:55,050
If there's any desire
left, take this...

1541
02:44:56,062 --> 02:44:58,724
Take this gun and shoot.

1542
02:44:59,466 --> 02:45:00,797
Shoot!

1543
02:45:13,079 --> 02:45:15,070
Madhavi still hasn't
regained consciousness.

1544
02:45:18,084 --> 02:45:20,484
Dear God, save Madhavi.

1545
02:45:23,089 --> 02:45:26,081
I am leaving but mark my words..

1546
02:45:27,093 --> 02:45:29,425
You will weep before
this very idol of stone!

1547
02:45:31,097 --> 02:45:32,564
You'll plead for mercy!

1548
02:45:50,050 --> 02:45:51,449
Dear God, I have come.

1549
02:45:53,787 --> 02:45:55,049
I am here.

1550
02:45:56,056 --> 02:46:02,052
Moti..kneels before you.

1551
02:46:03,396 --> 02:46:05,057
He bows his head to you.

1552
02:46:11,071 --> 02:46:13,062
I beg you for Madhavi.

1553
02:46:14,074 --> 02:46:16,065
For Madhavi's life.

1554
02:46:17,811 --> 02:46:19,073
Please god...

1555
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:22,071
I said, you were mere stone!

1556
02:46:22,716 --> 02:46:24,081
Take revenge from me.

1557
02:46:25,085 --> 02:46:26,746
I fought with you.

1558
02:46:27,087 --> 02:46:29,078
Take my life but spare her.

1559
02:46:30,090 --> 02:46:32,684
That poor thing hasn't done any wrong

1560
02:46:35,028 --> 02:46:37,019
Man is ungrateful.

1561
02:46:38,031 --> 02:46:41,023
But God should not be partial.

1562
02:46:44,037 --> 02:46:45,629
Oh cruel one, where are you?

1563
02:46:48,041 --> 02:46:52,034
Never in this life have
you ever given me anything.

1564
02:46:53,379 --> 02:46:57,543
You gave Madhavi to me and now
you're asking me for her life.

1565
02:47:01,054 --> 02:47:02,646
Is this your justice?

1566
02:47:03,723 --> 02:47:05,054
Dear God is this fair?

1567
02:47:08,061 --> 02:47:13,055
Mark my words, I won't let
you take Madhavi away from me.

1568
02:47:14,067 --> 02:47:15,728
You can never take
her away from me!

1569
02:47:19,072 --> 02:47:21,802
She..is my only hope.

1570
02:47:24,077 --> 02:47:28,741
If not for me, grant her
life and keep your good name.

1571
02:47:32,085 --> 02:47:34,019
How can I live without her?

1572
02:47:36,022 --> 02:47:38,013
How can I live without her???

1573
02:47:48,034 --> 02:47:50,025
Sir, Madhavi is conscious!

1574
02:47:50,537 --> 02:47:52,027
God heard our prayers.

1575
02:48:30,076 --> 02:48:34,012
I can't bear your tears.

1576
02:48:39,018 --> 02:48:40,349
Listen...

1577
02:48:41,020 --> 02:48:44,012
Will you honestly tell me something?

1578
02:48:46,025 --> 02:48:48,016
Don't lie to me.

1579
02:48:51,698 --> 02:48:56,499
Will I have you as my
husband in my next incarnation?

1580
02:49:02,709 --> 02:49:07,373
The spirit is one with God
none is above it

1581
02:49:10,049 --> 02:49:14,042
When the mind is illuminated..

1582
02:49:14,654 --> 02:49:17,054
The world brightens up

1583
02:49:19,726 --> 02:49:23,719
Let no dirt accumulate..

1584
02:49:25,064 --> 02:49:32,061
Let no dirt accumulate
on this immaculate soul

1585
02:49:33,473 --> 02:49:37,534
Your heart is a clear mirror
