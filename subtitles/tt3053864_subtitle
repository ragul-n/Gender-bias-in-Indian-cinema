00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:01,961
He left?

3
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,964
You didn't go with him?

4
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,964
Scoundrels,we are like
airplanes taxiing at the airport.

5
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,404
One by one, all of us will fly away.

6
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,541
Why do you need to be upset about it?

7
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,380
Jashn, go get beer.

8
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,992
As if he must be missing us over there.

9
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,953
Kuku, I don't feel
like leaving you guys.

10
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,956
Then let's go back.

11
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,525
<i>Forgelthemafiage.</i>

12
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,971
Go, you fool.

13
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:39,956
Get into the plane before
you change your mind.

14
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:44,971
Take care.

15
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,966
Call once your reach there.

16
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,174
Scoundrel.

17
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,975
He left us.

18
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,345
Why?

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,975
You think you are his wife...?

20
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,349
He found one.

21
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:57,951
Shetook him with her.

22
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,948
One day, we, too, will
find one and fly away.

23
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,153
Right, man? Tell him.

24
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,157
I don't want to get married.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,121
Friends and brothers part
moment a girl enters their life.

26
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,058
Saw my elder brother?

27
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,131
Moment he got married,
sister-in-law took him away.

28
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:16,969
What do you know?

29
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,982
You never had a sip of it.

30
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:23,967
You don't know there isn't a
better way to double your joy.

31
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,412
And the best way to drown your sorrows.

32
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:33,620
Buddy, I say, one day a plane will land.

33
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,957
And a very beautiful Punjabi
girl will come out from it.

34
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:59,969
And take me to the heavenly
land called Canada or Austrdia.

35
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,473
Scoundrel, come out of your dreamland.

36
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,579
She could be dangerous as well.

37
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,380
"Her waist measures 28
inches. She weighs 47 kilos."

38
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,959
"The girl. She weighs 47 kilos."

39
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,973
Oh my.

40
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,967
Careful. Careful.

41
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,663
What happened? Did you get hurt?

42
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,199
You were saying something.

43
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,740
Her waist measures 28
inches. She weighs 47 kilos.

44
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,434
That can't be your mother.

45
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,374
Must be your sister.

46
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,138
What have I done'?

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,341
Myself Shunty from Haiori Garden.

48
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,416
And myself Sahei from Patiala.

00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,178
Sahe], come on.

50
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,948
Sahei, you are here?

51
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,250
I thought you are coming tomorrow.

52
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:45,690
Idiot, I said PM not AM.

53
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,961
Gary, watch out if your touch your hair.

54
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,799
All you know is to use gel
to make your hair stand.

55
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:52,976
You don't know anything else.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,161
Look, sister, you shouldn't shout.

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,258
Maan Sahib says"

58
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,167
Shut up. Gary, don't say a word more.

59
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,706
I will manage. Don't worry. Gel: lost.

60
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,976
Gary isn't here.
- What now?

61
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,545
Let's hail a cab. Let's go.

62

Hello, Jashn'?

63
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,372
Did you make him board it?

64
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,960
You think I am a driver?

65
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,316
You guys get drunk and
I have to drop everyone.

66
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,965
Brother, you were the
one who used to say this.

67
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,458
"

68
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,970
"It's like a taxi service.".

69
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,972
Yes, why don't I start a taxi service?

70
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:27,977

00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:37,981
And you are not a taxi driver.

180
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:38,982
Great.

181
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,974
Anna, this is the reason
why foreigners are scared..

182
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:42,986
...of travelling to India. Why?

183
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,988
Because you find such people here.

184
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,990
They are cheats and liars.

185
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:47,981
They cheat everyone.

186
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,549
Give me a chance to speak.

187
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,378
I mean, what is it?
- Sahei, please.

188
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,921
He wants to say something.

189
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,966
Please, hear him out.

190
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,968
You are great. Imported
Goddess, you are great.

191
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,971
You understood this
mere mortal's feelings..

192
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,963
...and asked this Indian
Goddess to keep quiet.

193
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,976
Otherwise, this Indian Goddess doesn't
give anyone else a chance to speak.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,979
Hello, what are you saying?
- Sahe], please.

195
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,982
Let me complete first

196
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,984
I am not a taxi driver.

197
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,987
I have done my MA in geography
from Punjabi University Patiala.

198
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,990
I have 27 acres of land. I am a farmer.

199
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,992
I had gone to drop my
friend to the airport.

200
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,960
I was talking on the telephone.

201
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,962
You mistook me to be ataxi
driver and sat in the car.

202
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,963
I brought you here.

203
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,965
Neither did I misbehave on the way..

204
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,968
...nor did I steal
goods or money from you.

205
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:32,959
Why are you calling me a cheater?

206
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,972
You talk without thinking. You
don't give anyone a chance to talk.

207
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,964
L, too, can talk non-stop
like you. Now you can talk.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,978
Yes.

209
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:46,963
He never said that he was a taxi driver.

210
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,976
Sorry.

211
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:51,978
I said sorry.

212
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,992
She is the first woman in
the world to apologise".

213
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,961
...in a scolding and an angry tone.

214
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,963
Hello, I am not a woman, I am a girl.

215
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,965
Oh, again sorry.

216
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,968
Sorry that I called you a woman.

217
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:08,972
Sorry that I dropped you home
from the airport for courtesy sake.

218
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,974
Sorry for any misiake I might
make in the future as well.

219
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,966
Okay?

220
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,969
By the way, I am Anna.

221
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,974
Myself Kam aliit Singh.

222
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,987
People affectionately call me Kuku.

223
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,991
Khukhu?
- No. Not Khukhu, Kuku.

224
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,959
Kuku. Kuku.

225
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,961
My village is close by. Amampur.

226
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:32,952
It is just 12-13 kilometres away.

227
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,967
I'll be more than happy if you
come some time, to my place.

228
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,970
And my aunt will be happy. Aunt.

229
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,972
I am sorry. I am very late.

230
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,975
My aunt will kill me.
My aunt is very shrewish.

231
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,976
You don't know.

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,979
Shrewish? What does that mean?
- It means"

233
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,973
Shrewish. Shrewish.
- It means"

234
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,985
A very nice person.
- Yes.

235
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,988
Wonderful. Amazing person.
- Yes, that's what is means.

236
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,971
Oh. Okay. Okay. You
are also very shrewish.

237
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,952
Okay.
- Take care. Take care.

238
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,966
Sahe], it's a beautiful place.

239
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,969
Anna, this is my village.
And you will love it.

240
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:13,970
Seriously.

241
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:14,971
We will have a lot of fun here.

242
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,963
Come, lefs go.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,979
Hey. Which one of you was it?

244
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,982
Spoiled the atmosphere of the room.

245
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,566
First You have chickens
and then later crow.

246
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:29,986
Hey, wake up.

247
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,978
Calm down. What are you up to?

248
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:34,981
Wake up.

249
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:36,373
What is it?

250
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,245
Don't you have to go
for an interview today?

251
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,409
You go and build your body.

252
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,964
Let us sleep. Why are you troubling us?

253
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,967
Intelligent people say that
one should get up and exercise.

254
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,516
That keeps ones machinery well-oiled.

255
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:46,693
And these guys are lying here.

256
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,971
You oil your machinery.

257
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,963
Our machinery is fit and fine.

258
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,400
If this continues your
parts will stop functioning.

259
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,979
If you continue to drink like
this your liver will stop working.

260
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,981
Your engine will give up.

261
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,984
Jashn, you are putting your
education down the drain.

262
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,986
At leasi you should think of something.

263
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,988
Why don't you get me a job?

264
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:05,979
I have given around 150 interviews.

265
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:07,991
I still haven't got a job.

266
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,959
No one values education.

267
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,961
And you?

268
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:12,962
<i>Jae“-.</i>

269
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,964
Jagtar, listen to me.

270
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,958
Some people are born to have fun.
- Yes.

271
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,970
And some are born to serve them.
- Yes.

272
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,972
Keep doing your duties.

273
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,975
Bloody bugs.

274
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,977
Have sucked my blood.

275
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,969
Friendship is a curse.

276
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,991
<i>Come.</i>

277
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,949
Where are you these days?

278
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:49,946
I asked the old woman,
but she growled at us.

279
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:54,950
She is my aunt, but do you guys
call your mothers, old woman?

280
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,975
Karma, I think things have heated up.

281
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,977
We will have to cool it down.

282
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,981
Not a problem, we will add
somewater in his radiator.

283
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,984
Or we can throw him into the river.

284
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,987
Tell me, what have you decided?

285
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,989
My decision remains the same.

286
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,992
I am not a government officer to
take a bribe and change my decision.

287
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:20,964
Listen, no one will offer you
the money sir is offering you..

288
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,966
...for your land near the highway.

289
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,968
Your sir can even urish
to buy the GT road.

290
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,970
Will the government sell it?

291
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,972
No.

292
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:33,957
We know how to turn a no into a yes.

293
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,981
Hello.
- Where are you, sir?

294
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:38,982
The speaker is on.

295
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:39,983
.Karma is here.

296
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,986
You are always with him. Damn him.

297
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,987
No, he is my brother.

298
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,990
He is your brother.
But you listen to me.

299
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,992
You come to my place. I have some work.

300
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:49,959
We need to go some place.

301
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,961
Okay. Should I get Karma wilh me'?

302
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,964
Damn him. He has no work
to do. He won't let us work.

303
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,966
We need to do some work. Come fast.

304
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,969
Damn him.
- Hne, then I will come, brother.

305
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,971
I have kept the speaker on by mistake.

306
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:02,972
I don't know how to switch it off.

307
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,975
Who was he? Tell me, who was abusing me.

308
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,977
Forget it. Why are you getting hyper?

309
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,979
Actually, he didn't know
I was on speaker phone.

310
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,981
Everyone abuses you behind your back.

311
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:12,972
He abused you upfront.

312
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:14,984
You tell me his name.

313
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,602
Otherwise" otherwise I
will teach you a lesson.

314
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,740
Why are you getting angry with me?

315
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:20,990
You can take his number. What else?
- Yes.

316
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,982
Tell me his number.
- His number is 140..

317
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,943
120-10.
- 120-10.

318
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,957
His name is Jagtar.

319
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,436
Jagtar speaking.

320
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:47,368
You are abusing me. You
don't know me, you pig.

321
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,988
If you are a man then..
then come before me.

322
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:52,989
Who are you?

323
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:57,961
This is Karma. Karma. The
one whom you just abused.

324
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:02,966
If you are a real man then meet
me at the stadium in half an hour.

325
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,949
Look, what's my faultif
your engine is leaking oil.

326
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,973
It's my job to service it.

327
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,967
Disconnect the line, I'll be there.

328
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:32,962
Boss, this situation doesn't seem right.

329
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,964
Their muscles will do a lot of damage.

330
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,958
I have never been thrashed after school.

331
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,970
What should we do? Should we leave?

332
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,484
Hurry up.
- Let's go.

333
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:46,633
Don't even think of running away.

334
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,469
All the exits are sealed off.

335
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:54,984
Brother, Karma loves to joke around.

336
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:58,988
Tell him.
- Yes. Yes. Yes, brother.

337
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,991
I was iustioking with you.

338
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,962
Well, all of us are
worshippers of non-violence.

339
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,956
Non-violence. - But I don't
like anyone joking with me.

340
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,968
I never initiate it.

341
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:16,953
But if anyone messes me I never
let him go without a good service.

342
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,968
Tell me, will you fight
together or one by one?

343
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,973
One by one.

344
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,977
Go.

345
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:35,982
Why are you standing here?

346
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,954
You go.

347
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:47,950
Fatso, what are you doing? Come on.

348
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,977
Bodybuilder, you? You have
eaten a lot and made this body.

349
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,969
Come on now.

350
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,982
Now you come, Karam Singh Sandhu.

351
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:02,986
Brother, I am a dog.

352
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,971
Get a leash, put it
around my neck and tie it.

353
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:10,960
I like dogs.

354
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,952
But you are not of a good breed.

355
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:14,954
Get lost, you dog.

356
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,971
Look, son, I say we
should sell 'lhat land.

357
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,975
We will buy some other piece
of land here, in place of that.

358
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,979
And in future if he likes that place
then we'll buy another piece of land.

359
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,870
It's like he is a puppeteer
and we are his puppets.

360
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:33,973
We will do as he says.

361
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:37,411
He wants to build a shopping
mall on our piece ofland.

362
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,979
As if I will let him.
I will not spare him.

363
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:41,981
Yes.

364
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,961
First your parents passed away.

365
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:46,953
Now you are saying such things.

366
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:50,725
I have dedicated all my
life to you and Vinnie.

367
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,970
For what? To see this day?

368
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:57,974
Aunt, how many times have I told you
not to watch Elcta Kapoofs serials.

369
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:59,976
You get emotional in no time.

370
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,979
They can get their work
done with a small push.

371
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:03,980
And we can't even use the law?

372
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,983
It's like your eye is an eye
and ours is like a glass ball.

373
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,985
Yes. You have become very smart.

374
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,987
You don't need me anymore.

375
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,989
Do as you please.

376
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,991
I ask you to get married
and you don't agree to it.

377
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,960
Aunt, we will first gei Vinnie married.

378
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:17,961
Get Vinnie married.

379
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:20,964
And look, I don't have a
marriage line in my palm.

380
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:23,967
Aunt, I was thinking,
let's find a nice..

381
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,969
Handsome..

382
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,971
Beautiful ..

383
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,974
Lovely uncle, first

384
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:33,977
Wait. Damn you.

385
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:34,968
Theatrical lad.

386
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:36,660
Well done, boys.

387
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,605
You have come before me with such faces.

388
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:40,663
Don't you feel ashamed?

389
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:44,644
Look over here.

390
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,645
Look at their faces.

391
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:50,708
Brother, there isn't a spot on
his face left wherel can slap.

392
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:53,679
Scoundrel.

393
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,520
One..

394
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:01,584
Two..

395
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,598
Three..

396
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:13,734
Four..

397
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,702
Where are the other two?

398
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:24,677
Brother, the other two
are in the hospital.

399
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,481
Hospital ..

400
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,520
You look unharmed.

401
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,592
I had sent you for some important work.

402
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,492
And you came back thrashed.

403
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:40,523
Brother, we had gone to meet Kuku.

404
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:44,647
But.. but he got us trapped.

405
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,662
He lured you and you got trapped.

406
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,640
You don't have any brains.

407
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,677
Damn you.

408
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,581
You have humiliated me, you scoundrel.

409
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,584
- Hello, sir.

410
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,485
I had gone to your house to meet you.

411
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,580
From there I learnt that
you are at your farmhouse.

412
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:06,556
Order me.

413
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,561
Tell me, how can I serve you?

414
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,688
I thought you, too,
should have a look at them.

415
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:15,534
Wonderful.

416
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:21,507
Looks like they have been served well.

417
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:25,635
Son, did you lose any teeth?

418
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,514
Inspector, the boys who
did this should be arresied.

419
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,517
Sir..

420
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:39,584
First enlighten me, how
did they get into this mess.

421
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,721
And after they got thrashed,
they should've come to me first.

422
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,694
I would've gotten their medical done.

423
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,668
I would've filed a HR.

424
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:53,536
Don't blabber. You will
get the medical report.

425
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,507
Those boys should be arrested.

426
00:22:55,709 --> 00:23:00,510
Brother, we will get into
trouble if this gets to the press.

427
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,640
Television reporters hunt for such news.

428
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,627
And what if Kuku gives a statement..

429
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,710
"That we are forcing
him to sell his land?

430
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:08,682
We will get into trouble.

431
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,656
You are right.

432
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:19,498
Fine. So what if you get a
little thrashed for sir's sake?

433
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,695
Yes? Come on. Good. Come on. Come on.

434
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:24,730
Go in a single file.

435
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,630
Very good.

436
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,709
Very good.

437
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,672
Do have milk with turmeric in it.

438
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:35,548
Yes.

439
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,686
Fine. So, I'll make a move then.

440
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,489
Careful, don't scrape off your skin.

441
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,492
Tarsem Singh, give him Rs. 500

442
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,563
Lei it be.

443
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,574
I will count them.

444
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,610
Why do you take the trouble?

445
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:10,527
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

446
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,542
This is from your behalf. Thank you.

447
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,486
Listen .
- Yes?

448
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:18,582
Reason it with Kuku.
- Not a problem, sir.

449
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,525
Not a problem.

450
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:26,692
A thousand scoundrels died and
that's when Uiagar Singh was born.

451
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,567
See you. Bye.

452
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,605
And copy to all.

453
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,647
Heis a duplicitous.

don't trust him at all.

454
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:45,515
Watch out, he will get
us into trouble one day.

455
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,646
We can't do all the dirty jobs.

456
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,589
We need such people as well.

457
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:59,531
Papa, how could you even think
that I would marry any boy?

458
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,592
Why? You have to get married.

459
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:05,595
You are of marriageable age.

460
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:09,539
All the relatives still taunt
me that I sent you abroad, alone.

461
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,511
Papa, I'm not saying that
I don't want to get married.

462
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,707
But I won't get married to a stranger.

463
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,608
Mummy, why are you keeping
quiet? Say something at least.

464
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:24,615
Look, she has just come and
you are already after her.

465
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:29,586
And talk softly, what will
Sahefs friend think of it?

466
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,722
Why? Don't they get married in abroad?

467
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,633
I was not in the favour of sending her.

468
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,727
I send her only because
you pressurised me.

469
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:41,551
Now if she will go to Canada, she
will go there only after marriage.

470
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:45,569
Papa, but this is for sure that I
won't get married in this manner.

471
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,672
What did you say?

472
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:50,573
Then get this straight as well.

473
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:53,485
Now if you go to Canada
you will go there"

474
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,524
...only after getting married
to a boy of my choice.

475
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,590
Otherwise forget about Canada

476
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,492
Mr. Sidhu and his son
are coming over tomorrow.

477
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,496
I don't want any problems.

478
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:12,570
Sahei, father is looking
for a lot of boys for you.

479
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,574
They are ready to spend Rs.
30-35 lakhs to go abroad.

480
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:19,610
Shut up. Stop adding fuel to fire.

481
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,614
"Stop adding fuel to fire.'

482
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:24,617
Mum my, is it true'?

483
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:28,620
Papa is talking about money while
looking for alliances for me?

484
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:32,626
Sahei, you forget about these things.

485
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:35,560
Go. Go upstairs to your friend.

486
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,563
That means this is true.

487
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:40,601
In olden times, people used to make
deals involving their daughters.

488
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,645
Or poor people used to
sell their daughters.

489
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,660
But father is great.

490
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:47,700
No, it is no so, dear.

491
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,653
Mummy, if it is not so then
place your hand on my head..

492
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,647
...and say that Gary is lying. Place it.

493
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:55,706
I know.

494
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:11,554
Drunkards, from where
did you get this beer?

495
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:12,599
From the wine shop.

496
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,395
Will your father pay for it?

497
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:15,525
Why will our father pay for it?

498
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:16,626
You will.

499
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:19,095
Do I owe something to your father?

500
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:24,554
Look, for God's sake, I
beg of you, take up aiob.

501
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:26,546
If nothing else, wash
cars at my workshop.

502
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:27,705
Anyway I am short of labour.

503
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,547
Do these handsome faces
look like that of labourers?

504
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,712
He does look like a daily wager.

505
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:38,489
I don't come to your workshop as
people will mistake me to be the boss.

506
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,721
They will call you an
employee. This isn't right.

507
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:44,498
Maharaia of Patiala, get
out of your dreamland.

508
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:45,589
Put your feet on the ground reality.

509
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,633
Here you go.

510
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,568
Now you call Pizza man.
Please. We are very hungry.

511
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:51,548
Call.

512
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,700
Do one thing, roast
me, add salt and eat me.

513
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,675
Useless guys.

514
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,651
Anna, pack your bags.

515
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:07,551
Why?

516
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,555
Weiusi landed yesterday.

517
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:12,490
I still have ietlag.

518
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:17,655
And I still haven't unpacked fully.

519
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:19,699
That's even better. You
don't need to unpack.

520
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,559
<i>0K5!-</i>

521
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,663
If you are uncomfortable,
I'll move to a hotel.

522
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:28,706
What are you saying?

523
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:31,544
I brought you to India

524
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:37,482
Actually, the thing is,we are
running away from the house.

525
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,629
We are running away.
- Okay.

526
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:41,644
What? What are we doing?

527
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,520
Quiet. Keep quiet.

528
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,582
We are vanishing? We are running away?

529
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,661
Why?
- I'll tell you.

530
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,630
My dad is getting me
married against my wishes.

531
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:54,532
He has queued up boys for the same.

532
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:57,662
If I stay here, he will
get me married for sure.

533
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,630
But how can he do this?

534
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,603
He can't do it. He cannot force you.

535
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:06,556
I'll go and set him right.

536
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,550
Sit down. My dad has become greedy.

537
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:13,484
The boy's family which
gives him HsBO-AO ldrhs"

538
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:17,634
I mean 3-4 millions, my dad
will get me married to that boy.

539
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:19,592
It's crazy.

540
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,662
Let me talk to your father.

541
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,528
I'll set him straight.

542
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,643
Anna, you cannot reason it with him.

543
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,658
We are just running
away from here tomorrow.

544
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:34,505
Listen, tomorrow morning Gary will
be out of the house with our bags.

545
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:38,512
We just have to jump off 'lhe
bulwark behind the house and leave.

546
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:41,549
Bulwark?
- Wall.l mean wall.

547
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,482
It sounds like an Indian movie.

548
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:48,644
In Indian movies the heroine escapes
from her house in this manner.

549
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:51,657
Good. Very exciting.

550
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:06,699
"Watch out, boy. Your
father might show up."

551
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:08,571
Gal'!!-

552
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:10,734
Where are you going so
early in the morning'?

553
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:14,715
Daddy. I was going to the gym.

554
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:18,481
What made you think of a
gym today, all of a sudden?

555
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:20,520
You never wake up before noon.

556
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,533
I thought it keeps one healthy.

557
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:27,687
And even Maan sahib says that other
things can wait, health comes first.

558
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:30,731
I think you're still not
over with singing fever.

559
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:33,657
No, daddy, Its over.
I feel much better now

560
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,668
Hne. After you come back from the gym ..

561
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:37,602
...go and take care of your work.

562
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:39,672
Okay. Okay.

563
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:42,599
Can I go?
- Yes.

564
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:44,575
<i>0K5!-</i>

565
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:48,513
Thank God.

566
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,519
'Everyday I take.."

567
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:55,487
"I taken"

568
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:06,724
fine, God.l am drunk. My
wife hits me with her sandals.

569
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:12,639
Now even you have
started doing the same?

570
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:21,570
I won't drink. I won't drink
again, God. I won't drink.

571
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:23,548
But don't hit me again.

572
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:24,550
Don't hit me again.

573
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:25,551
Yes.

574
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,610
Brother. Brother.

575
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:29,647
Come here. Listen.

576
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:33,536
Now I have even started hearing things.

577
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,656
But why does God should like a woman?

578
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:41,544
Hey, Goddess Parvati will
obviously sound like a woman.

579
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
Come here.

580
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,665
You are Godess Parvati?
- Yes.

581
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,731
But you look young.

582
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:51,637
Quietl am still a child.

583
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:53,705
Do you want my blessings?
- Yes.

584
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,613
Stand next to the well. Hurry up. Hurry.

586
00:31:58,585 --> 00:31:59,677
Yes. Yes. Yes.

587
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,615
Bend over like a horse. Bend over.
- I should bend over?

588
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,550
Good. You at least recognised me.

589
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:10,689
My wife thinks I am a donkey.

590
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,542
Ouch.
- It's okay. It's okay.

591
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:13,727
We know that you are a horse.

592
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:16,526
And that too a good one.

593
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:21,541
Child, you should never drink again.

594
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,702
Otherwisel will turn you into ashes.

595
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:29,676
Goddess, can I stand straight now?

596
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:35,612
Inspector, you did a good thing
by sending these people over.

597
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,589
I was going to come to meet you.

598
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:40,559
You guys can relax. Rest.

599
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:44,529
How did you cometo know
that I need protection?

600
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:45,642
That my life is in danger?

601
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:48,636
Son, I'm 'lhe inspector of this area

602
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,628

The thing is, Ni".
Kamaliit Singh alias Kuku..

604
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,737
...
 am calm in the morning.

605
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:07,713
After dealing with
criminals I get hyper.

606
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:13,489
Thething is, brother,
you are very stubborn.

607
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:16,639
I am stubborn.

608
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:20,566
Mr. Harnam Singh..
- Is a dog.

609
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,500
He is the one who is running
illegal businesses in your are

610
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:23,627
Booth capturing during elections.

611
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:25,604
Taking over someone's land.

612
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,539
He even sells drugs in this are

613
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:28,666
I say you should arrest him.

614
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:31,541
I have called you here
to reason that with you.

615
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:34,707
He has lodged a complaint against you.

616
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:38,617
If I want, I can arrest you.

617
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:42,679
But no, you are a nice man.

618
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:48,553
Hence, you should stop being
stubborn and sell your land.

619
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:52,529
Hear that. Now you
have put me in a dilemm

620
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:55,633
You are telling me to sell the land.

621
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:59,605
And the IG says that he wants
the marriage to take place there.

622
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:00,731
Now whom should I listen to'?

623
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,634
<i>Them'!?</i>

624
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,509

You don't know?

626
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,717
Hear that. ThelG's
niece is engaged to me.

Sir.

629

Why are you standing
here and staring at me?

630
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:23,622
Go to Gopal siore and get a
quarter kilo of sweets and pretzels.

631
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:24,630
Just a minute.

632
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:27,599
I think Gopal doesn't give
a quarter kilo of sweets.

633
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,694
Get half a kg.
- Okay, sir.

634
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:34,639
The thing is, brother,
as soon as I came know".

"That Harnam's men
have approached you..

636
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,579
...
 immediately got into action.
- I know.

637
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:49,555
Brother, I want to get
transferred to Mandi Govindghar.

638
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,649
You know there are big
steel dealers there.

639
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:56,697
I have to get my
daughter married as well.

640
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,657
You want your daughter
to marry a steel dealer?

641
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:02,725
No. I will be able to get her married"

642
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:05,505
...only when steel
dealers will do something.

643
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:08,564
Oh. I got it.

644
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:10,701
That's not a problem.
I'll get you transferred.

645
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,678
I'll send someone away from
there and send you away from here.

646
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:29,528
Okay, brother, I'll make a move then.

647
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:31,587
Yes, go on.
- Don't forget me.

648
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:34,544
Yes, I will. Just keep doing your duty.

649
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,662
Okay.
- Bye, WYS-

650
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:38,603
Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

651
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,504
You, too, hello.

652
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:41,507
Hello.

653
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:42,701
I never imagined

654
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:47,657
I never thought that
you'll come over like this.

655
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,581
What are you saying, Mr. Kuku.

656
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,618
You had helped us a lot.

657
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:55,519
Won't we even come to
your house to thank you?

658
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,557
No, why not?

659
00:35:57,624 --> 00:36:01,527
I would say, this is
like your own house.

660
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:02,721
Yes.
- Saw, Anna?

661
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,522
Didn't
 say that Mr.
Kuku is a very nice man?

662
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,535
Yes.
- He said it, this is like our own house.

663
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:13,665
So, we can stay in our house for a few days.
- Yes..

664
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:17,543
'Hear that.
I was just being courteous.'

665
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,579
'They are getting too emotional.'

666
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:22,581
'God Almighty, what
have you got me into?'

667
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:25,642
'They don't know of my aunt.'

668
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,484
Kuku. Kuku.

669
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:29,681
Aunt

670
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:31,582
Aunt

671
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:32,558
Kuku.

672
00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:33,525
You are back?

673
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:34,720
Where did you go so
early in the morning?

674
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,624
Aunt, I..
- Okay, so you are his aunt.

675
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:43,637
Hello, aunt. You are just like
Mr. Kuku has described you.

676
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:46,605
Yes, aunt, you are very shrewish.

677
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:51,609
What did you say? I am shrewish?

678
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,648
Who told you that I am shrewish?

679
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:57,582
Kuku said. You are very shrewish.

680
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,631
Aunt, I just remembered
an important work.

681
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:04,681
I'll just go and meet the headman"

682
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,692
Wait. I will tell you.

683
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:09,690
Come back and I will show
you how shrewish I am.

684
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:12,698
Don't call me aunt if
I don't break your legs.

685
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,501
Shrewish is a bad word?

686
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:17,647
It's something bad?
- No, it's a good thing.

687
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:20,697
Aunt, let go of your
anger. She is my friend.

688
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:21,707
She has come from Canada

689
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:25,541
She didn't know and
Mr. Kuku joked with her.

690
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:28,638
I know, dear. Kuku is very naughty.

691
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,615
Just like his father.

692
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:33,517
But where did you meet him?

693
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:36,522
Aunt, should we tell you
everything standing outside"

694
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,649
...or will you invite us in?
- Yes, of course.

695
00:37:38,726 --> 00:37:41,661
Kuku has made me crazy. Come in.

696
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,595
Come on in. Come in.

697
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:56,642
Jagtar. Jagtar.

698
00:37:57,544 --> 00:37:58,705
<i>Jae“-.</i>

699
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,741
Jagtar, you still aren't ready?
- Yes.

700
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:03,626
We had to go to Kuku's house today.

701
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,674
Come on, hurry up.
- Come.

702
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:08,484
Let me work. I need to repair
these two cars by evening.

703
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:09,545
Brother, try and understand.

704
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,682
Two very beautiful girls
have come to his house.

705
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,490
That too from Canada

706
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:17,496
Weasels, get lost from here.

707
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,565
Girls these days are very smart.

708
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,696
They first look at how much
land he owns, what does he do..

709
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,729
...what is his bank balance
and both of you are useless.

710
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:30,553
Jashn is educated but jobless.

711
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:33,672
And Deep took five years
to complete his graduation.

712
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:35,511
I made sure I learn it well.

713
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:38,643
And when I ask them to
work they feel insulted.

714
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,551
Listen, brother.

715
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:42,486
Brother, listen to me.

716
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:43,580
Look here.
- Yes.

717
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:44,590
Look carefully.

718
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,558
This handsome face"

719
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:49,562
Do you think we are born to work?

720
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,564
We are born to rule.

721
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:52,531
Yes.

722
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,661
Kings of pauper land, get
lost from here. Let me work.

723
00:38:57,604 --> 00:39:00,539
Forgive me.
- How can we forgive you?

724
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:02,575
You are our brother.
- I am.

725
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:03,610
You are our bro.
- That I am.

726
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:04,667
You are our nurturer.

727
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:06,536
Our provider.

728
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:08,638
Our car provider.
- That too.

729
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,575
Car? Sukhi.
- No, we don't want to have te

730
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:15,588
Get a hammer. Let's service them.

731
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:16,623
Brother, get this straight.

732
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,591
If you don't help us, we
will hang ourselves here..

733
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,595
We will hang ourselves here.
- Suicide.

734
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:25,542
Get them a rope.
- No. Cancel.

735
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:31,596
Look Jagtar, Kuku is hungry and is hiding from his aunt.
- Yes.

736
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,504
We have to take him home.
- Yes.

737
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:35,736
And aunt's stuffed bread"
- Stuffed with potatoes.

738
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,602
Yes. With cumin seeds.
- 'With coriander seeds.

739
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,669
'With buttermilk.

740
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,738
A bowl of curd.
- Yes.

741
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,608
Sukhi, you remove the engine.

742
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,676
I'll go do something for
brothers and come back.

743
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,930
Pacing won't help.

744
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,966
Pacing won't help..

745
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:03,060
Now what will I tell Mr. Sicliu'?

746
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:04,935
That our daughter ran away?

747
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:08,051
Our Daughter had to run away
because of the schemes you are up to.

748
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,134
I say, tell me, where has she gone?

749
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:18,817
Wherever she is. She is safe ..

750
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:22,080
...and her father own stood
before her as an enemy.

751
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:28,019
You tell me, what wrong did she do
in going somewhere to save herself?

752
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,597
Okay, so now I am her enemy.

753
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:34,931
So affectionately I brought
her up, educated her.

754
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:36,936
I spent money in sending her abroad.

755
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:38,938
And now she has become so independent.

756
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:41,634
"That she doesn't like the
boy selected by her 'lather.

757
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:45,112
What would've happened if
she would've met the boy once?

758
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:49,107
I wonder where she ran away.

759
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:53,017
It's so nice. Here friends
have time for each other.

760
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,954
In Canada, everyone
is running after money.

761
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:57,081
No one has time to spare.

762
00:40:57,157 --> 00:41:00,923
And here, everyone is sitting idle.
- Yes.

763
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:02,962
Jagtar and Jashn too were sitting idle.

764
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,000
I gave them a job in my workshop.

765
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:08,125
Your engine needs finetuning, I guess.

766
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,130
Jagtar is a very good
mechanic of our workshop.

767
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:12,070
The head mechanic.

768
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,164
And Jashn handles the accounts.

769
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:18,001
And Deep has decided
that he won't go to Canada.

770
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:20,240
...no matter how many proposals
he gets from there.

771
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,994
No.
- He says his workshop is doing great.

772
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:27,044
He is well settled. How can he leave? Right?
- He can't.

773
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,919
No.- No, he is
right. - Of course.

774
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:29,979
It's a practical thought.
- True.

775
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:32,924
He is right.- Yes.-
Kuku, I didn't say so.

776
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:36,122
No, you didn't say so,but
this is what you mean.

777
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:39,126
This is the central idea of what you said, right?
- Of course.

778
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,026
How can he leave his workshop and go?

779
00:41:42,102 --> 00:41:45,094
No, Jagtar can handle the
worlcshopflight, Jagtar?

780
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,971
No, I am your servant.

781
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:49,066
What can a servant do without his employer?
- Yes.

782
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:50,076
Right. He's right.

783
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,938
You know I, too, really
wanted to go to Canada

784
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:56,481
But after I went there I realised
how hard one has to work there.

785
00:41:56,784 --> 00:42:02,814
How many times have I told Sahei
to find a Canadian resident for me.

786
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:05,081
But she doesn't.

787
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,685
First find yourself a
]ob."Find me a girl."

788
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:09,929
Sit down.
- I don't wish to work.

789
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,020
You guys..

790
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:12,065
Sorry.

791
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:14,010
You guys wait till my cassette
is released.

792
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:16,526
I will make everyone eat out of my hand.

793
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:18,535
Right, Deep?

794
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:21,964
Even Jagtar gets marriage
proposals from Canada

795
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:24,977
But he doesn't want to
get married and go to Canada

796
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:28,982
Because he is Lord Hanuman's devotee.

797
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:31,143
There is no tradition of
getting married in his family.

798
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:33,078
Oh, my God.

799
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:35,422
Then how was Jagtar born?

800
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:37,615
Valid question.

801
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:38,968
What do I say about us?

802
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:41,051
My family looks for
stray kids.

803
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:49,962
I don't undersiand, sir.

804
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:51,300
How do I eat?

805
00:42:51,538 --> 00:42:56,019
I am feeling restless.

806
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:58,569
I feel I cannot Kuku's case.

807
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:02,776
Why? Has he become your senior?

808
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,018
He has got a better promotion, sir.

809
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,287

G's son-in-law is the whole
department's son-in-law.

810
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:12,015
I am just a small inspector.

811
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,082
Tell me, what should I do?

812
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,026
Brother, I think he has lost his mind.

813
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:18,087
My wife would know if Kuku gets engaged.

814
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:21,100
Because Kuku's sister
works in my wife's school.

815
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:23,967
Kuku's sister's the one
who is getting engaged.

816
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:25,972
He is so stupid.

817
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:28,005
Look at that, sir.

818
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:33,013
To call a government officer fool
is like calling the government fool.

819
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,979
Really?

820
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:36,039
So if anyone comes and
tells you thatl am the SSP..

821
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,050
...will you believe it?

822
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:42,077
How can anyone say that? I
will first enquire about it.

823
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:44,090
Did you enquire about Kuku?

824
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,929
No,I didn't.
- Then go and do it. There the topic ends.

825
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:51,963
Someone has eaten any my
expense for the first tim e..

826
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:53,143
...in my 25 years of service.

827
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,135
And herel don't feel like
eating anything.

828
00:43:56,403 --> 00:44:01,569
Now do you know how we
feel when we feed you?

829
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:08,575
My right palm was itching since morning.

830
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:10,144
I was bound to suffer a loss.

831
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,087
Come on.

832
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,952
Go.

833
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:20,153
Anna has come to India
only because of me.

834
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:23,123
Some Balbir Singh from Hardaspun.

835
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:28,060
...em otionally trapped Anna's
sister and got married to her.

836
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:31,036
And then he disappeared from
there with all her money.

837
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:34,097
And now we have found
out that he is in Punjab.

838
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:36,943
You didn't lodge a police complaint?

839
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,102
We have lodged a report everywhere.

840
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:40,146
But he has vanished.No one can find him.

841
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:43,946
Actually, there is no one
by that name in that village.

842
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:45,983
<i>Strmge.</i>

843
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,923
My sister is in depression.She
is in a bad state.

844
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:52,117
You know we don't care about money.

845
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,126
But he has cheated us.

846
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:58,123
He has defamed us Puniabis.We
should find the scoundrel.

847
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,944
There are so many
Balbir Singh in Punjab.

848
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:02,026
Where will we find this person?

849
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:04,047
And who knows whether he is dead or alive.
- Yes.

850
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:06,062
And if he has lied about his village"

851
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,075
...he must have lied about his name as yes.
- Yes.

852
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:11,054
How can someone do like that?

853
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:13,012
All of you are so nice.

854
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,945
But he? A cheat.

855
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:19,111
Let's do one thing. There is a
Sikh temple 50 lcilomelres from here.

856
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:21,079
Let's go there and pray.

857
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:24,034
A pray made from a true
heart always comes true.

858
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:26,117
Look, I have to testify
for Nirm al's case tom orrow.

859
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:27,992
We will go day after tomorrow.

860
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:32,329
Mr. Kuku, each day is
very precious for Anna

861
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,993
We will go in our car. It's okay.

862
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:37,003
Our old man won't let
us take the car.

863
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,006
Deelfs car?

864
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:42,133
Yes, we will take my car.
- Yes, of course.

865
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:44,177
His father has left a lot for him.

866
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,238
Scoundrel, the car
belongs to your father?

867
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,107
"
 will get the car."

868
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:49,416
It is after a long time
that I've liked a girl.

869
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,947
And she's from Canada!

870
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:54,030
You are a celibate. You should try and undersiand my
feelings. - Yes.

871
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:56,648
So what shouldl do?
- Why are you behaving like this?

872
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:59,085
Look, be a brother and give us the car.

873
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:04,063
Scoundrels, you saw a girl from Canada
and both of you started drooling.

874
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:08,500
Both? Hey, Jashn, man, why
don't you go for the foreigner?

875
00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:09,636
Don't look towards Sahe].

876
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:12,101
Looking at my sister's state, I don't
think the foreigner will suit me.

877
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:14,407
That's leaves me with
only one girl, Sahei.

878
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,940
I think she is very smart.

879
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,172
That means you won't go
after her. Thank you, man.

880
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:19,969
Now you are talking like a kid.

881
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:23,544
You can only marry someone you love.

882
00:46:23,717 --> 00:46:25,981
Then think that I love her a lot.

883
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:28,578
Love. You?

884
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:32,051
You met the girl iusi once
and you're in love with her?

885
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:36,139
Why don't you say that you don't
see the girl but the dollars?

886
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:38,063
Why'? Love at first sight.

887
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,931
And this is how love happens.
- True.

888
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:46,128
So, buddies,
 am
here,but is the car ready?

889
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:50,974
Gary, my car has broken down.

890
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:54,140
Jagtar is repairing my new
car.It's not repaired as yet.

891
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:56,979
Really? The car has broken down?
- Yes.

892
00:46:57,184 --> 00:47:01,883
You were weaving your tales well.

893
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,923
My car com es here for repairs.

894
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,119
I know Jagtar since a
long time. Right, Jagtar.

895
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:10,994
You are my younger brother.
- No, I am your brother.

896
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:14,035
Jagtar, it would've been
great if we could get a car.

897
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:17,929
Becausel am asking Sahei to
fix me up with the foreigner.

898
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:21,075
If things work out, your
brother's life will be made.

899
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,939
Then you can do whatever you
want,there won't be a problem?

900
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,978
A lover boy? You too?

901
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,614

...you let the girls stay at your house?

955
00:51:43,137 --> 00:51:45,071
This is all thanks to her support.

956
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:47,167
Otherwise how can a girl
from a decent family..

957
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,966
...go and live at someone else's house?

958
00:51:50,043 --> 00:51:52,978
What makes you think you are decent?

959
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:55,105
You were making a deal
involving your daughter.

960
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:59,016
Sir, those who makes deals of
their daughter aren't called decent.

961
00:51:59,086 --> 00:52:03,148
Sister, I tried explaining
to him, our girl is smart.

962
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:05,948
It is not right to force her like this.

963
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:10,122
Shut up. I will slap
you.You have defamed us.

964
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:13,167
Sir, is this away to talk?

965
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:16,993
She is your wife and not someone
you have bought off the market.

966
00:52:17,071 --> 00:52:18,129
I dare you to touch her.

967
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,173
Then see what I do to you.

968
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:23,068
Look, this is our personal matter.

969
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:24,941
You don't need to interfere.

970
00:52:25,012 --> 00:52:27,140
I have full intentions to
interfere in this matter.

971
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:30,047
If you have the courage
then try messing with me.

972
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:32,108
He says don't interfere.

973
00:52:33,187 --> 00:52:35,087
Why are you showing your teeth?

974
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,024
What's wrong with my teeth?

975
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:40,117
They all seem to be in their place.

976
00:52:40,961 --> 00:52:43,123
My aunt is the one who
manages to pull outteelh well.

977
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:46,142
She pulls them and
places them in one's palm.

978
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,931
Aunt has done so with
more than the village.

979
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:52,939
Sister, don't feel
bad about what he says.

980
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:55,168
Shut up. You too have
started blabbering.

981
00:52:55,976 --> 00:53:01,005
Listen, if he ever raises
his hand on you then tell me.

982
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:04,107
If I don't make him stand in
the middle of the village"

983
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:07,154
"and hit him with a stick in such
a way that he will follow you..

984
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:09,980
"Like a puppy all his
life,no one will call me aunt.

985
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,991
Get up, let's go.

986
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,038
Sit down, girl. I want to talk to you.

987
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,156
You can leave. Go.

988
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:22,935
And listen.. don't make the mistake
of raising your hand on her again.

989
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:26,064
Otherwise, lnder Kaur
does what she says.

990
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,051
Shall I escort you out?

991
00:53:28,075 --> 00:53:32,155
"When it thunders like dark
cloud,my aunt's stick lashes out."

992
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:33,271
<i>"Dean."</i>

993
00:53:33,414 --> 00:53:34,848
He acts brave.

994
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:36,379
He has scared the whole family.

995
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:38,015
Don't be afraid of him, dear.

996
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,143
Anna
- Yes.

997
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:56,967
What did you ask God for?
- What else?

998
00:53:57,504 --> 00:54:02,465
And thatl should get
a chance to punish him.

999
00:54:04,044 --> 00:54:06,156
And what did you ask God for?

1000
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,012
What else could I ask for?

1001
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:10,141
I prayed to God for only one thing.

1002
00:54:10,984 --> 00:54:14,113
That my dad should stop
looking for weird boys for me.

1003
00:54:14,955 --> 00:54:16,923
I will find one for myself.

1004
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:17,980
Nice.

1005
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:19,025
Sahe].

1006
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:20,060
Yes?

1007
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:22,152
What kind of a boy do you like?

1008
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:24,927
Why should I tell you?

1009
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:28,060
VWII you find such a person for me?

1010
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:33,140
Or are you thinking about
what are your chances?

1011
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:38,154
No, it's not so.
- Why? Why isn't it so?

1012
00:54:38,178 --> 00:54:41,079
What do you mean? Am I not beautiful?

1013
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:43,073
What kind of boys are you?

1014
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:46,084
There is such a nice
girl standing before you.

1015
00:54:46,186 --> 00:54:48,951
And you are not thinking about
what are your chances with her.

1016
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:53,119
Jashn, you always stay quiet.

1017
00:54:53,994 --> 00:54:55,120
You should say something
sometimes at least.

1018
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:57,163
Yes, speak up.

1019
00:54:58,065 --> 00:55:02,145
Well, a person needs to know where
he siands even to flirt anyone.

1020
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:07,938
Look, Maan says, "Our status..'
- Shut up.

1021
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,068
VWII we just keep standing here?

1022
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:12,135
Shall we go inside?

1023
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,378
Yes.

1024
00:55:13,514 --> 00:55:14,845
Actually, I am starving.

1025
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:19,062
Just a minute. You guys go
ahead,we will go visit the washroom.

Come here. Come here. Come here.

1028
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:28,972
Thanks, man. You told her
that you are not interested.

1029
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,930
When did I say that?
- Over there.

1030
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:32,363
I was talking about my status.

1031
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,525
That's why.. that's
why you don't progress.

1032
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:36,993
Now I will show you how to trap a girl.

1033
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:39,165
As if she is not a girl, but
a fish which you can trap.

1034
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,134
Telling thetruth doesn't help at all.

1035
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:44,041
You should make girls emotional.

1036
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:45,155
Emotional.

1037
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,058
Fine. But all I know is
that if 'lhere is no love".

1038
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:51,143
"Between the girl and the
boy then nothing can happen.

ove.And stay here.

1041
00:55:57,024 --> 00:56:01,962
I feel you have changed your
mind about going to Canada, right?

1042
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,053
It hasn't changed.

1043
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:07,966
I will surely go if I fall
in love with a Canadian girl.

1044
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:10,936
Hello, listen to me, don't eye Seine].

1045
00:56:11,004 --> 00:56:11,971
She is mytarget.

1046
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,098
Now should I get my eyes
removed or get my ears oiled?

1047
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:16,108
You should know what you want.

1048
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:18,076
But Sahei is my target.

1049
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:22,048
Don't worry about me.
By the way, all the best.

1050
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:23,140
Thank you.

1051
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,981
This way.

1052
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,111
That's done. Come, let's go.

1053
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:36,794
Hey, man. You okay?

1054
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:39,093
I'm okay.
- You are alright?

1055
00:56:42,002 --> 00:56:44,096
'If Ilhy this noise'? What happened?

1056
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,138
Actually, I..

1057
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:46,963
Just a minute.

1058
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:53,503
Actually, I was cleaning mytongle.

1059
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,604
Why?

1060
00:56:57,051 --> 00:57:01,284
I have to talk to such a
clean girl all day along..

1061
00:57:03,056 --> 00:57:04,922
<i>'Nhalewen.</i>

1062
00:57:07,027 --> 00:57:10,156
Oh, my God. Aunt it chewing wood.

1063
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:13,058
Stupid, it's edible branch, not wood.

1064
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,999
That's actually an edible
toothbrush.

1065
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:19,997
Margosa tree's branch.

1066
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,009
And your mouth will be clean.

1067
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:27,239
Indian toothbrush.
- Oh.

1068
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:31,995
Oh. Okay.
- I'll get you one. I'll get you one.

1069
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:34,784
Anna, come with me
Let's tour the village.

1070
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:36,389
Here's your Indian toothbrush, Anna

1071
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:38,491
And one for you also.
- Thank you, brother.

1072
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,927
We will go have a tour
of the village. Let's go.

1073
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:43,620
Be careful of the village dogs.

1074
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:47,023
Why'? Do your village's
dogs bite outsiders?

1075
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:49,092
No, those dogs are very tame.

1076
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:52,503
Actually, a lot of people
in our village act like dogs.

1077
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,043
What people are dogs?
- You won't get it. Come, let's go.

1078
00:57:57,177 --> 00:57:59,111
Well down.

1079
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,079
Keep drinking.

1080
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:03,139
You have made me so proud.

1081
00:58:05,018 --> 00:58:07,030
Have some shame. You are smiling?

1082
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:09,079
I am being sarcastic.

1083
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:13,923
That's greaLbrother. What men you have.

1084
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:15,155
Useless guys.

1085
00:58:15,963 --> 00:58:17,124
Tarsem, you should stay calm.

1086
00:58:18,132 --> 00:58:20,032
Listen to me.

1087
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:22,959
If we buy the land around the highway"

1088
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,081
...hen we can sell them to
builders at inflated rates.

1089
00:58:25,105 --> 00:58:31,010
Brother, the man and his land
relationship get in our way.

1090
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:35,012
No, it won't. There are still
many fools in this world.

1091
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:38,007
Only Kulcu is a tough nut to crack.

1092
00:58:38,118 --> 00:58:40,086
I don't know who has trained him.

1093
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:42,032
Brother, why do you worry?

1094
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:44,115
Kuku's sister teaches
in my wife's school.

1095
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:45,925
She is getting married on Sunday.

1096
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:48,038
I will be going there.

will talk to him over there.

1097
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:50,087
It's good if he agrees
otherwise we will use our muscle.

1098
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:52,142
That ends to topic.
- That's right.

1099
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,134
<i>Hi! your (kink than.</i>

"She looked at me and
stole my heart away."

1102
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:31,539
"When she passes by me, at a slow pace."

1103

"The girl looked at me
and stole my heart away."

1105
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:42,614
"She looked at me and
stole my heart away."

1106
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:46,517
"She looked at me and
stole my heart away."

1107
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:51,523
"The boy doesn't tell
but he steals glances."

1108
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:56,618
"The boy doesn't tell
but he steals glances."

1109
00:59:58,532 --> 01:00:01,524
"His mind keeps wandering somewhere."

1110
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:05,505
"
 feel he won't be able
to survive without me "

1111
01:00:05,573 --> 01:00:08,565
"The boy doesn't tell

1112
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:11,475
"He doesn't tell but he steals glances."

1113

"He doesn't tell but he steals glances."

1114
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:23,650
From where did she come here?

1115
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:26,450
Hoopi. I iusi remembered something.

1116
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:27,551
I'll have to 
eave.

am suffering a huge loss.

1117
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,357
I'll have to go.
- You are strange.

1118
01:00:29,496 --> 01:00:30,540
We have come for \finnie's engagement.

1119
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:31,531
And you are talking about leaving.

1120
01:00:31,598 --> 01:00:32,326
Listen to me.

1121
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:34,959
Do one thing, ask Kuku
to meet me in the evening.

1122
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:35,625
But listen to me.

1123
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:38,536
Ask him to meet me in the evening.
- But..

1124
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:41,506
"Her eyes drown you in them."

1125
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:44,567
"This is first time I have
seen such intoxicating eyes."

1126
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,582
"Her eyes drown you in them."

1127
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,642
"This is first time I have
seen such intoxicating eyes."

1128
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:56,616
"My life is at stake, I swear on God."

1129
01:00:58,525 --> 01:01:02,484
"My life is at stake, I swear on God."

1130
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:06,656
"She looks so beautifuLiusi
like Heer's sister."

1131
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:11,603
"When she dances in such a manner."

1132
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:15,531
"The girl looked at me
and stole my heart away."

1133
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:18,488

"Our heart gets into trouble."

1136
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:38,530
"When it heeds to our eyes."

1137
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:45,462
"Once it gets trapped
there is no escaping."

1138
01:01:45,573 --> 01:01:50,636
"A look is enough."

1139
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:58,711
"It gets difficult to survive
a loss in love, my friends."

"You never know when
you fall for someone."

1143
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:21,574
"When love enters your heart."

1144
01:02:21,642 --> 01:02:24,668
"The girl looked at me

"She looked at me and
stole my heart away."

1147
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:46,660
"One doesn't have to
explain things about love."

1148
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:50,562
"Love just happens, you
don't go looking for it."

1149
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:54,667
"One doesn't have to
explain things about love."

1150
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:58,706
"Love just happens, you
don't go looking for it."

1151
01:03:00,514 --> 01:03:03,609
"Like he feels his heart
is not in his control."

1152
01:03:05,586 --> 01:03:09,454
"Like he feels his heart
is not in his control."

1153
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,583
"
 too feel that my heart is helpless."

1154
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:17,655
"
 feel he is slowly
dwelling in my soul."

1155
01:03:18,499 --> 01:03:20,627
"The boy doesn't tell
but he steals glances."

1156
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:23,534
"The girl looked at me
and stole my heart away."

1157

"The girl looked at me
and stole my heart away."

1159
01:03:28,709 --> 01:03:33,670
"The boy doesn't tell
but he steals glances."

1160
01:03:38,686 --> 01:03:40,484
Sahe].

1161
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:43,555
You sing well.

1162
01:03:43,624 --> 01:03:44,682
Thank you so much, Deep.

1163
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,654
By the way, your friend
Jashn sings very well.

1164
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:49,519
Kuku is right.

1165
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:52,498
Girls must be crazy about him. Right?

1166
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,466
What are you saying?

1167
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:57,697
He is from a very ordinary family.

1168
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,600
He sings at weddings and makes a living.

1169
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,576
But I had heard that
he is good in studies.

1170
01:04:05,546 --> 01:04:07,571
What's the use? No job.

1171
01:04:07,648 --> 01:04:08,706
He doesn't have a job.

1172
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:10,574
He owns no piece of land.

1173
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:14,485
But he has principles like
that of Mahatma Gandhi.

1174
01:04:14,555 --> 01:04:17,525
Fine. Forget about
JashmLets talk about you.

1175
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:19,536
Everyone has gone to have dinner.

1176
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,528
And you are still here. Come on.

1177
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:24,530
You too have dinner.
- I have lost my appetite.

1178
01:04:24,765 --> 01:04:27,996
Why?
- I can't eat or sleep.

1179
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:30,160
Deep, did you consult a doctor?

1180
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,567
It's a bad thing.

1181
01:04:32,506 --> 01:04:33,667
The doctor is standing before me.

1182
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,540
Who? Me?

1183
01:04:37,645 --> 01:04:40,512
Good, you at least recognised it.

1184
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:44,518
Sahei, from the time I have seen you..

1185
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:49,647
...it's like someone has taken
my sleep, hunger and thirst.

1186
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:55,594
Sahe], did you feel
bad about what I said?

1187
01:04:56,597 --> 01:05:01,592
We

.. Look, I am not a bad boy.

1188
01:05:02,503 --> 01:05:04,562
Deep, I know you are a very nice boy.

1189
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:08,538
But, look, Deep, we can
be very good friends.

1190
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:11,510
I am not talking about friendship.

1191
01:05:11,645 --> 01:05:14,671
Try and understand me.

1192
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,648
You try and understand.

1193
01:05:16,717 --> 01:05:19,448
We metiust a few days back.

1194
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,454
We hardly know each other.

1195
01:05:21,522 --> 01:05:24,617
We have a lifetime to know each other.

1196
01:05:25,526 --> 01:05:28,587
And, one falls in love
at first sight, right'?

1197
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:30,588
I cannot say anything at the moment.

1198
01:05:30,664 --> 01:05:34,601
Well, okay. I have
said what I wanted to.

1199
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:37,503
If you want to take
some time then do so.

1200
01:05:38,505 --> 01:05:43,602
But, be careful, I shouldn't
be another man to lose his love.

1201
01:05:47,581 --> 01:05:49,675
Hey, what are you doing here?

1202
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,650
Everyone is having dinner.

1203
01:05:52,486 --> 01:05:53,612
Let's go.

1204
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:59,625
Wow. It's so beautiful.

1205
01:06:00,594 --> 01:06:01,652
Beautiful.

1206
01:06:03,597 --> 01:06:10,628
So, what happened?
- Anna, Navdeep says that he loves me.

1207
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:14,507
I never thought about it.

1208
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:17,473
And I never encouraged him either.

1209
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:22,548
He is not a bad boy.
- Yes, he isn't.

1210
01:06:22,683 --> 01:06:25,653
But one cannot decide on that basis.

1211
01:06:27,554 --> 01:06:31,650
But the boys your dad is
selecting are very bad.

1212
01:06:31,725 --> 01:06:33,523
I know.

1213
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:39,543
Do one thing, select a
boy and get married to him.

1214
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:41,558
And Deep is a good boy.

1215
01:06:41,635 --> 01:06:44,696
Hey, then your dad can't do anything.

1216
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:48,498
And, moreover, Deep loves you.

1217
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:53,605
Shut up. I don't know whether he
loves me or is it about going to Canada

1218
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:58,528
But.. your idea isn't bad.

1219
01:06:58,552 --> 01:07:02,580
Anyway, soon or 
ater,

have to get married.

1220
01:07:02,656 --> 01:07:04,624
Then why should I delay it?

1221
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:08,471
I will think about Mr. Deep.

1222
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:10,463
Come, lefs go.
- Let's go.

1223
01:07:11,665 --> 01:07:14,396
Brother, my head is spinning.

1224
01:07:14,568 --> 01:07:17,094
I saw Halina's sister
dancing at a wedding.

1225
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:24,637
Brother, I think trouble has
come knocking at our door.

1226
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:28,614
Did you confirm it was her or did
you run away from a random foreigner?

1227
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,541
Brother, who will
recognise her if not me'?

1228
01:07:31,618 --> 01:07:33,552
I stayed with her in her
sister's house for six months.

1229
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:35,646
If I don't recognise her
will Uiagar recognise her?

1230
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:40,654
Sir, I can recognise
someone from his fragrance.

1231
01:07:41,729 --> 01:07:44,494
Sit down, I know you.

1232
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:46,497
There isn't much difference
between you and a dog.

1233
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:50,629
Gall me a dog if you
want,at least I am loyal.

1234
01:07:50,704 --> 01:07:53,571
You shouldn't praise yourself
at every opportunity you get.

1235
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:56,611
You shouldn't interfere when we
are talking about something serious.

1236
01:07:57,644 --> 01:08:01,672
Tarsem, control your angenLet
me think of something.

1237
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:07,543
Listen, henceforth, you won't
come before that foreigner.

1238
01:08:08,622 --> 01:08:10,556
She won't stay here forever.

1239
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:15,588
Got it?
- Okay, brother. I got it.

1240
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:24,467
Very good. I am having a lot of fun.

1241
01:08:24,538 --> 01:08:27,599
You know, this is the first
timel am sitting on a tractor.

1242
01:08:28,676 --> 01:08:33,546
Kuku, tell me something,why
didn't you get married?

1243
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:36,675
'With any Indian girl or a foreigner?

1244
01:08:48,662 --> 01:08:50,528
I'm sorry, Kuku..

1245
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,566
...if I've made you upset.
- No.

1246
01:08:54,635 --> 01:08:57,502
Everyone asks me this question.

1247
01:08:58,505 --> 01:09:00,530
I should've got married five years ago.

1248
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:04,243
But perhaps God didn't
want that to happen.

1249
01:09:04,678 --> 01:09:09,479
You mean God? What does God
have to do with your marriage?

1250
01:09:10,718 --> 01:09:12,618
Anna, you are na6ve.

1251
01:09:12,686 --> 01:09:17,522
In our country
everything is done by God.

1252
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:21,652
When God didn't want meto get
married,how could I get married?

1253
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:27,525
That's strange. Why can't
you get married as you please?

1254
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:31,560
Aunt worries about
you.Don't you care for her?

1255
01:09:31,705 --> 01:09:33,605
Hear that? Why don't I care for her?

1256
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:36,509
Who do I have other than aunt?

1257
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:38,602
She has dedicated her life to us.

1258
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:40,670
Then make her worries go away.

1259
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:42,476
Get married.

1260
01:09:42,549 --> 01:09:46,508
I can get married, Anna
But there is a problem.

1261
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,579
What?
- I will need a girl to get married to.

1262
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:54,460
And you need a girl who loves you.

1263
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:56,553
And you, too, should love her.

1264
01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:01,466
And love happens just
once, in your life.

1265
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:05,639
And once that passes
by,it never comes back.

1266
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:11,478
You mean, you were in love with someone?

1267
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:14,547
What happened?

1268
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:20,578
I was in love. And
perhaps,she too, loved me.

1269
01:10:21,555 --> 01:10:25,583
I just couldn't say it out aloud.

1270
01:10:25,659 --> 01:10:29,596
And I thought she would
read it in my eyes.

1271
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:33,556
I couldn't gather courage
to go and tell her.

1272
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:36,660
What?
- I love you.

1273
01:10:37,671 --> 01:10:39,639
But you just said it.

1274
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:44,654
I must've said it a thousand
times behind her back.

1275
01:10:44,678 --> 01:10:47,579
But I couldn't open my mouth
when I was standing before her.

1276
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:48,581
Never.

1277
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:53,519
Now if you like any
girl,you must say I love you.

1278
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:58,535
Any girl yearns to
hear these words. Okay?

1279
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,618
You must say it out aloud.

1280
01:11:00,694 --> 01:11:05,542
Out aloud. How loud?
- I love you!

1281
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:07,660
Have you gone crazy? All
the villagers will hear it.

1282
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:14,551
Hey, if that girl loves you, she too will say I..
- Softly. Softly.

1283
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:15,633
Love you.

1284
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:17,601
Fool.

1285
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,614
I think I wouldn't be able to
gather courage this time as well.

1286
01:11:21,515 --> 01:11:23,493
Otherwise, I would've
said it right away.

1287
01:11:23,517 --> 01:11:25,451
Crazy.

1288
01:11:25,653 --> 01:11:27,485
You said something?

1289
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:33,637
No. I was saying, aunt
must be waiting for us.

1290
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:37,564
Yes, let's go. Sahei and
I have to go out as well.

1291
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:46,483
Sahei, should I talk?
- No. Please.

1292
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:48,498
You go to the room, I'll comethere.

1293
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:52,475
Thank you, ma'am.
Sir.Breakfast was very nice.

1294
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:56,641
You guys talk. Saheilll be in my room.
- Okay.

1295
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:07,537
Was shetroubling you?
She could've stayed here.

1296
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:09,529
Shut up. He keeps talking nonsense.

1297
01:12:09,596 --> 01:12:11,587
You told her as well?

1298
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,662
She is my friend. We share things.

1299
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:17,469
They share things.

1300
01:12:17,538 --> 01:12:19,529
You love doing this, don't you?

1301
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:22,508
You have defamed me.

1302
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:24,600
I know what excuses
I have made to people.

1303
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:27,538
Does it look good, you staying
at someone else's place like this?

1304
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:29,615
Viflll I ever think of something
that isn't good for you?

1305
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:32,584
I won't let anything
happen against her wishes.

1306
01:12:32,653 --> 01:12:36,590
Refuse all the families
you have spoken to.

1307
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:38,591
Tell them we have fixed her alliance.

1308
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:40,627
You interfered again?

1309
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,662
Have you forgotten this hand?

1310
01:12:43,664 --> 01:12:46,531
Garmail, call Kuku's aunt.

1311
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,591
Mummy, I will call her right away.

1312
01:12:48,669 --> 01:12:50,535
Son, what's the need for that?

1313
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:54,651
I was saying why we need to call her.

1314
01:12:54,675 --> 01:12:58,475
It is our personal
matter,we will resolve it.

1315
01:12:58,546 --> 01:13:06,454
"Daddy, don't fight like
this.Mummy has high contacis."

1316
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,578
Shut up.

1317
01:13:07,654 --> 01:13:09,452
I wonder from where he was born.

1318
01:13:09,523 --> 01:13:12,458
He is yours. I didn't bring him with me.

1319
01:13:12,526 --> 01:13:14,688
Mummy, here, call aunt.
- Give it to me.

1320
01:13:15,496 --> 01:13:20,593
Look at that. He wishes to
see his father get an earful.

1321
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:25,571
Daddy, we don't like
embarrassing you either.

1322
01:13:25,706 --> 01:13:28,676
We, too, are humans. We have brains.

1323
01:13:29,543 --> 01:13:31,477
We aren't cattle that you are nurturing.

1324
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:33,604
Now I'll see how you go
to lnder Kaur's house.

1325
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:35,513
I will break your legs if you do.

1326
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,575
If we don't reach there by
4:00pm ,aunt will come here.

1327
01:13:38,652 --> 01:13:41,631
Daughter can lay their lives
for their father's honour.

1328
01:13:41,655 --> 01:13:44,647
I've heard this dialogue in a movie.

1329
01:13:45,492 --> 01:13:48,484
Dear, your father's
honour lies at your feet.

1330
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:49,620
Make sure you don't tarnish it.

1331
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:53,463
Which movie was it?
- Keep quiet and sit there.

1332
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:54,592
Movie buff.

1333
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:58,628
Sahe], stay here.

1334
01:13:59,573 --> 01:14:02,474
Your daddy doesn't
like you staying there.

1335
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:05,604
Mummy, I will come back.l
will get married as well.

1336
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,649
But the boy will be someone I like.

1337
01:14:08,716 --> 01:14:10,514
Look at the result of
sending her to Canada

1338
01:14:10,618 --> 01:14:12,529
Enjoy the consequence.

1339
01:14:12,553 --> 01:14:14,521
"The boy will be someone I like."

1340
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:18,616
Mummy,
 know aboy.
- I told you to keep quiet and sit tight.

1341
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:22,655
She will marry the boy I accept.

1342
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,664
I will marry after you
give your acceptance.

1343
01:14:24,732 --> 01:14:26,666
But he will be my choice.

1344
01:14:27,501 --> 01:14:28,627
She is right.

1345
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:32,640
I wouldn't have married
such an authoritarian"

1346
01:14:32,706 --> 01:14:35,573
...if someone would've
asked me my choice.

1347
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:37,510
An authoritarian?

1348
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:38,670
What did you say? An authoritarian?

1349
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:40,680
I am an authoritarian?

1350
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:45,508
So, what have you decided, Sahei?

1351
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,511
I am so confused.

1352
01:14:48,589 --> 01:14:51,456
Both the boys are
good.They are different.

1353
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:56,520
Deep is very loud, outspoken.one
has to ask him to keep quiet.

1354
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:59,567
And Jashn, you have to
make him to talk to you.

1355
01:14:59,633 --> 01:15:01,601
Deep believes in showing off.

1356
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:04,502
And Jashn never hides anything.

1357
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:07,667
I asked did you make a decision.

1358
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:09,533
It will take some time.

1359
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:12,580
But Sahe], both of
them are close friends.

1360
01:15:12,713 --> 01:15:16,513
There will be differences
between them because of you.

1361
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:19,645
A friendship that falls apart because
of a girl, isn't strong enough.

1362
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:23,614
You are a smart girl.
- Thank you.
 know that.

1363
01:15:28,562 --> 01:15:31,463
I tell you, once girls enter a beauty
parlour they can be thrown out..

1364
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:35,696
"But they never come out willingly.

1365
01:15:36,503 --> 01:15:37,664
By the way, we didn't tdce that long".

1366
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:39,638
"That you are making
such a scene about it.

1367
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:41,573
You say you didn't take long but ask me.

1368
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:43,474
I am the one who was
standing outside, waiting.

1369
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:44,636
Really?

1370
01:15:45,512 --> 01:15:47,606
Welcome. I was waiting for you.

1371
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:49,513
Are we late?

1372
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,449
No, you are on time.

1373
01:15:51,685 --> 01:15:55,622
Kuku said we are late.
- When didl say so?

1374
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:58,651
That's what you meant. Be honest.

1375
01:15:59,493 --> 01:16:00,654
Right, Vinnie?
- You are right.

1376
01:16:01,495 --> 01:16:03,623
Don't involve Vinniein
it.Come on, lefs go inside.

1377
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:05,632
Where is Sahei? She didn't come along?

1378
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:08,478
Sahei has gone out for lunch.

1379
01:16:08,502 --> 01:16:10,480
Okay.
- She must have had hers.

1380
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:13,132
Ours is getting cold inside.
- Yes, please. Please come in.

1381
01:16:25,553 --> 01:16:26,645
No, the land is very useless.

1382
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:31,459
Yes. Make the deal.
- Brother.

1383
01:16:31,525 --> 01:16:34,517
400 acres. Don't worry about the money.

1384
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,586
I'll arrange for the money.
- Broth er. Brother.

1385
01:16:37,665 --> 01:16:39,463
Yes.

1386
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:41,545
Gall me in the evening.

1387
01:16:41,569 --> 01:16:42,661
I'll give you all the information.

1388
01:16:43,504 --> 01:16:45,495
Brother, listen to me. Just a minute.

1389
01:16:45,573 --> 01:16:46,699
At least let me finish the conversation.

1390
01:16:47,508 --> 01:16:49,670
I'll be finished by the
time you finish this.

1391
01:16:50,511 --> 01:16:51,637
Why? Are dogs behind you?

1392
01:16:52,546 --> 01:16:55,538
Brother, one can survive a
dog bite but not a bullet.

1393
01:16:55,716 --> 01:16:57,616
She came home today.
- What did you say?

1394
01:16:57,685 --> 01:16:58,675
That foreigner came to your house?

1395
01:16:59,487 --> 01:17:00,454
Did she see you?

1396
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:02,632
Brother, I wouldn't be standing
here if she would've seen me.

1397
01:17:02,656 --> 01:17:04,681
You would come enqJiring
about me in central jail.

1398
01:17:05,726 --> 01:17:07,558
Brother, do something.

1399
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:09,596
I don't understand how
did he come to your house'?

1400
01:17:09,663 --> 01:17:12,564
Wives have a bad habit of
inviting people for lunch.

1401
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:15,466
They think people will say
the lunch was very tasty.

1402
01:17:15,536 --> 01:17:18,506
She told me not to go outside
todaygguests are coming home.

1403
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:19,596
"There's a surprise for you."

1404
01:17:19,673 --> 01:17:21,471
This is the surprise she gave me.

1405
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:22,668
She has given me a 440 volts shock.

1406
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:24,602
She has smoked me.

1407
01:17:25,513 --> 01:17:26,674
Brother, you can still do something.

1408
01:17:27,515 --> 01:17:28,505
Otherwise, both of us will get trapped.

1409
01:17:28,582 --> 01:17:30,516
I will do something
once you stop yelling.

1410
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:33,553
We are already in trouble and
on top of that you are yelling.

1411
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:43,497
I'll have to make arrangements
to send you abroad.

1412
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:46,622
That's right, brother. Send me abroad.

1413
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,600
Otherwise they will arrest me.

1414
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:52,469
Brother, I swear, my life will be made.

1415
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:56,507
I feel greedy when I see tasty food.

1416
01:17:56,577 --> 01:17:57,669
And then I overeat.

1417
01:17:58,512 --> 01:17:59,673
This is the result of overeating.

1418
01:17:59,747 --> 01:18:02,682
You haven't eaten anything.You
areiusi making noise.

1419
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,617
I love Indian food.

1420
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:08,621
You just lilcelndian food
and not the Indian men'?

1421
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:13,456
I thought all Indians are like Balbir.

1422
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:16,561
My opinion was bad about Indian men.

1423
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:19,694
But, I found men like Kuku also.

1424
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:24,597
They are helpful and
kind.And I changed my opinion.

1425
01:18:24,672 --> 01:18:28,631
Anna, my brother is single. A bachelor.

1426
01:18:31,512 --> 01:18:33,480
I know he is single.

1427
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:38,542
The one who will marry
him will be very lucky.

1428
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,650
'Anna, the one who marries you
will also be very formnate.'

1429
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:45,617
What are you thinking about, Kuku?

1430
01:18:45,693 --> 01:18:47,457
Nothing.

1431
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:49,460
What will I think about?

1432
01:18:49,697 --> 01:18:52,496
Can I use the washroom?
- Yeah, sure.

1433
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,466
That way, adjoining the bedroom.

1434
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:04,636
Where is Mr. Tarsem?

1435
01:19:05,613 --> 01:19:08,514
He was here. I wonder where he has gone.

1436
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:11,449
His meetings don't let him sit at home.

1437
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:53,517
Hey. You?
- What are you doing here?

1438
01:19:53,594 --> 01:19:56,495
Sahei has called me here.

1439
01:19:56,597 --> 01:19:59,498
Sahei has invited me as well.

1440
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:05,538
Come, let's go then.
- Okay. You too come along.

1441
01:20:06,774 --> 01:20:08,469
Hi, Sahe].

1442
01:20:08,642 --> 01:20:10,110
Hello, Sahe].
- Hello.

1443
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:13,139
Sahei, you didn't tell me that
you have invited Jashn as well'?

1444
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:15,648
Well, I had called up both of you.

1445
01:20:15,716 --> 01:20:17,684
Don't you both discuss
things among yourselves?

1446
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:20,618
I thought you might have
surely discussed about it.

1447
01:20:20,688 --> 01:20:22,782
Yes. - No.
- Yes.- No.

1448
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:25,689
I mean, we didn't meet yesterday.
- Yes.

1449
01:20:25,759 --> 01:20:28,592
Otherwise we share everything between us.
- Yes.

1450
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:32,632
And the mobile network is also
down most of the time nowadays.

1451
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:34,599
Isn't it? It's not possibleto talk.

1452
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:35,278
Yes.

1453
01:20:35,302 --> 01:20:37,270
Okay, sit down. Or do
you want to keep standing?

1454
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:39,639
Yes, yes, sure. Do you want to sit?

1455
01:20:39,707 --> 01:20:42,608
Yes, sure.
- Come, sit.

1456
01:20:48,816 --> 01:20:52,684
Anna, I want to change your
name from Anna to Anna Hazare.

1457
01:20:52,753 --> 01:20:55,723
He is on hunger strike and you
have taken an oath of silence.

1458
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:57,723
This girl didn't utter
a single word on the way.

1459
01:20:58,759 --> 01:21:01,660
She looks upset as if she is
getting cramps in her stomach.

1460
01:21:01,729 --> 01:21:02,719
Are you feeling alright?

1461
01:21:02,796 --> 01:21:04,696
Yes, Kuku,
 am okay.

1462
01:21:04,765 --> 01:21:08,668
Hello, if you want to lie
say it with confidence.

1463
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:13,830
This Kamaliit Singh Kuku,
can catch a lie very easily.

1464
01:21:14,642 --> 01:21:15,837
Tell me the truth. What's the matter?

1465
01:21:21,849 --> 01:21:25,683
He is Tarsem Singh, why
do you have his photograph?

1466
01:21:25,753 --> 01:21:28,745
He is not Tarsem, he is Balbir.

1467
01:21:31,692 --> 01:21:33,683
Anna, your eyes have become weak.

1468
01:21:33,761 --> 01:21:35,729
He is Tarsem Singh, a
very big businessmen.

1469
01:21:35,796 --> 01:21:39,596
And you got the report in Canada
that Balbir Singh is missing.

1470
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:41,692
Believe me, he is Bdbir.

1471
01:21:41,769 --> 01:21:45,637
You are mistaken. And you only
said that Balbir Singh wears turban.

1472
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:46,696
And he doesn't wear a turban.

1473
01:21:46,774 --> 01:21:50,711
Then Balbir Singh and Tarsem
Singh, how can be the same thing?

1474
01:21:51,712 --> 01:21:54,807
Why don't you believe
me? He is the same thug.

1475
01:21:55,749 --> 01:22:00,585
Bring him before me
just once. Am I lying'?

1476
01:22:03,824 --> 01:22:07,658
No. No, Anna, you cannot lie.

1477
01:22:10,631 --> 01:22:15,728
<i>BuLburlii Tasan Singh
is Baht Singh hem.</i>

1478
01:22:17,738 --> 01:22:23,768
...
 will definitely
expose him. I promise you.

1479
01:22:37,758 --> 01:22:38,816
The food was very tasty, isn't it?

1480
01:22:39,627 --> 01:22:39,786
Yes.

1481
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,760
We have overeaten as the food was tasiy.

1482
01:22:48,836 --> 01:22:50,702
No, I'll pay the bill.

1483
01:22:54,809 --> 01:23:01,647
Oh, no. Jagtar, scoun..
Sorry. He took my wallet.

1484
01:23:01,716 --> 01:23:02,239
Is it?

1485
01:23:02,349 --> 01:23:03,714
And he didn't even keep it back.

1486
01:23:06,654 --> 01:23:10,716
Do one thing, you pay the bill.
Look it was my lunch treat.

1487
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:12,623
I'll pay you later.

1488
01:23:12,827 --> 01:23:16,730
Deep, you very well
know that the money..

1489
01:23:16,797 --> 01:23:19,698
...my father sends me gets over
by the 15th or 20th of the month.

1490
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:21,758
Right? So what's the date today?

1491
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:23,599
24th.

1492
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:27,674
This Jagtar is taking undue
advantage of our friendship.

1493
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:29,608
We have to teach him a lesson.

1494
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:31,668
You are absolutely right, Deep.

1495
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:33,770
Even though if your
employee is your friend"

1496
01:23:33,847 --> 01:23:38,717
...he shouldn't forget that along with
being a friend he is also a servant.

1497
01:23:38,786 --> 01:23:44,816
Don't worry I'll pay the bill. As
it is, I had invited both of you.

1498
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:47,787
Okay, fine. But I owe you guys a treat.

1499
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,694
And I don't like girls paying the bill.

1500
01:23:50,764 --> 01:23:53,734
Why? Why can't girls pay the bill?

1501
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:58,739
Jashn, you tell me, havel done
anything wrong by paying the bill?

1502
01:23:58,806 --> 01:24:04,836
No, I don't feel so. As it
is, I cannot afford the bill.

1503
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,647
Why do you worry when I am there?

1504
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:11,583
I am there. Okay, fine,
I owe you for this bill.

1505
01:24:11,652 --> 01:24:13,780
Sahe], I will pay you
when I meet you nexttime.

1506
01:24:13,854 --> 01:24:14,764
Shall we leave now?

1507
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:20,693
No, you both sit and think who
will pay the bill nexttime.

1508
01:24:20,761 --> 01:24:24,629
I'm leaving,
bye-bye. - Bye.

1509
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:41,739
Stop. Stop. Stop the jeep.
Stop, stop. Stop. Stop.

1510
01:24:42,816 --> 01:24:45,717
Tell me one thing, you scoundrels,
you want liquor before..

1511
01:24:45,786 --> 01:24:47,584
"And after the meals.

1512
01:24:47,654 --> 01:24:49,679
This is not liquor, this is beer.
He doesn't even knows this much.

1513
01:24:49,823 --> 01:24:51,668
When did we drink before lunch?

1514
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:52,750
We cannot drink in front of Seine].

1515
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:53,816
We have some self-respect.

1516
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:56,824
Okay, tell me one thing,
when did I steal your wallet?

1517
01:24:57,665 --> 01:24:58,791
Rascals, you both steal money
from my pocket every day.

1518
01:24:58,866 --> 01:25:00,630
Did I ever say anything to you?

1519
01:25:00,701 --> 01:25:01,759
Did you tell him this?

1520
01:25:02,803 --> 01:25:04,669
Listen, Tara

1521
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:06,731
You steal money from my wallet and..

1522
01:25:06,807 --> 01:25:07,831
...now you call me
Tara instead of Jagtar?

1523
01:25:08,676 --> 01:25:09,768
Sorry, sorry. Very sorry.

1524
01:25:09,844 --> 01:25:11,812
Sardar Jagtar Singh Hai.
- Check.

1525
01:25:11,879 --> 01:25:15,838
Listen, don't listen to Jashn.

1526
01:25:16,684 --> 01:25:19,779
The quiet and silent types of
people are very smart and cunning.

1527
01:25:20,688 --> 01:25:24,647
When you know that Sahei is
mine even then you went there.

1528
01:25:24,725 --> 01:25:26,693
You went there without
informing your friend. Why.'

1529
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,660
It's okay.
- What "it's okay"?

1530
01:25:28,762 --> 01:25:31,775
If the girl calls me how
could I refuse and stay back.

1531
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:33,790
Scoundrel, you could have made
some excuse and stayed back.

1532
01:25:33,868 --> 01:25:38,635
She is going to be your
sister-in-law in future.

1533
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:40,697
Stop dreaming of making
her our sister-in-law.

1534
01:25:40,775 --> 01:25:41,765
The girl has not even said it once.

1535
01:25:41,842 --> 01:25:45,801
Listen, you did not go?
You are questioning me?

1536
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,747
She is my girlfriend.
- Alright.

1537
01:25:48,816 --> 01:25:50,694
No, it's not alright.

1538
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,743
If he says that Katrina Kaifis my
girl friend, would you believe it?

1539
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:57,656
Listen to me, I have told you so
many times to stay away from girls.

1540
01:25:57,791 --> 01:26:00,624
Once a girl comes into our
lives our friendship falls apart.

1541
01:26:00,694 --> 01:26:01,684
Look at this.

1542
01:26:01,762 --> 01:26:05,790
You are wrong. Listen to me, if
everybody worships Lord Hanuman..

1543
01:26:05,866 --> 01:26:08,631
...then how will this
universe move ahead?

1544
01:26:08,702 --> 01:26:11,694
Man does not make the universe
move it's the God who helps it move.

1545
01:26:11,772 --> 01:26:14,742
After giving birth to four
kids we say it's God's gift.

1546
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:16,837
It must be happening with
guys like you, not us.

1547
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:19,670
I am going to relief myself.
- Let's go.

1548
01:26:31,659 --> 01:26:33,650
What are you saying, Kuku?

1549
01:26:34,728 --> 01:26:37,789
It's good that you didn't speak
with anybody else about this.

1550
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:41,778
Mr. Tarsem Singh is
a respectable person.

1551
01:26:41,802 --> 01:26:44,648
You are saying that he is Balbir Singh.

1552
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:47,698
I am very confident, sir.
 am sure.

1553
01:26:47,775 --> 01:26:50,745
Madam , the time period
you are talking about.

1554
01:26:50,811 --> 01:26:53,746
...Tarsem Singh was
in India at that time.

1555
01:26:54,748 --> 01:26:57,740
He was working on a
project near Bangalore.

1556
01:26:57,818 --> 01:27:02,666
And his wife was in England
for educational purposes.

1557
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:05,716
But Anna cannot make such
a big mistake, Inspector.

1558
01:27:05,793 --> 01:27:07,727
What do you mean?

1559
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:11,599
You just bring Tarseln
Singh in front of me once.

1560
01:27:11,665 --> 01:27:14,657
Madam, tomorrow if you say
you suspect Amitabh Bachchan..

1561
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:17,796
...bring him to you.
It's not how things work.

1562
01:27:17,872 --> 01:27:22,776
You should have some evidence.
Do you have Balbir Singh's photo?

1563
01:27:23,844 --> 01:27:25,642
Do you have any?

1564
01:27:26,814 --> 01:27:29,681
Strange, he lived with
you for six months"

1565
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,684
...and you don't even
have his photograph?

1566
01:27:34,688 --> 01:27:39,683
When you filed a report in Canada
the embassy had sent his photo.

1567
01:27:40,694 --> 01:27:43,823
But he was some other person.

1568
01:27:45,866 --> 01:27:49,700
The way we feel that all
the Japanese look dike".

1569
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,831
...similarly,
 feel she feels that
all the men in turban look alike.

1570
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:54,665
Am I right?

1571
01:27:54,742 --> 01:27:56,676
I don't know about that, Inspector"

1572
01:27:56,744 --> 01:27:59,645
"but I feel all the
policeman are alike.

1573
01:28:00,781 --> 01:28:03,773
We will inform you if
we get any information.

1574
01:28:04,752 --> 01:28:05,742
We will call you up.

1575
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,619
We will be grateful you.
- Yes.

1576
01:28:09,657 --> 01:28:12,592
I was also wondering how my photo
disappeared from the bedroom.

1577
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,770
No problem, it's just the photo.

1578
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:15,694
What will she do with the photo?

1579
01:28:15,763 --> 01:28:19,597
That's okay, brother,
but you please support me.

1580
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:20,691
Sir, you know it very well
that I did everything"

1581
01:28:20,768 --> 01:28:21,826
...as per your instruciions.

1582
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:23,728
As per my instructions?

1583
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:25,799
Did I tell you to go
and trap a foreigner?

1584
01:28:26,774 --> 01:28:29,653
Your wife went to study
and you trapped a foreigner.

1585
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:31,668
And what was the need for
you to flee with her money?

1586
01:28:31,846 --> 01:28:34,713
Brother, I..
- Shut up you rascal.

1587
01:28:35,716 --> 01:28:37,741
We settled Dasonda's
matter after you left.

1588
01:28:38,686 --> 01:28:40,677
But you have ruined the
whole matter after returning.

1589
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:49,721
Sir, what are your orders for me?

1590
01:28:49,863 --> 01:28:52,764
Well, I don't give any
information to anyone"

1591
01:28:53,734 --> 01:28:57,830
...but
 can't help it,
my kids are growing up.

1592
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,631
Their needs are also increasing.

1593
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:04,804
Stop laughing. Give him some money.

1594
01:29:05,813 --> 01:29:09,647
Saw? Saw that? Sir
has been so kind to me.

1595
01:29:09,884 --> 01:29:14,685
But a pet dog never
bites the family members.

1596
01:29:14,822 --> 01:29:16,813
Hem ember one thing Uiagar Singh..

1597
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:20,717
...if1he dog acts crazy, its shot dead.

1598
01:29:21,862 --> 01:29:27,699
But my experience says that
if a mad dog bites anyone..

1599
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:31,671
...then the dog also dies.

1600
01:29:34,742 --> 01:29:37,803
Good bye, and copy to all.

1601
01:29:44,685 --> 01:29:49,646
Sir, this mad dog of yours
will definitely bite us someday.

1602
01:29:55,796 --> 01:29:56,820
She has come.

1603
01:29:57,965 --> 01:29:59,694
Hello.
- Hello.

1604
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,128
My servant told me that you have come.

1605
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,637
What a pleasant surprise!
Please be seated.

1606
01:30:04,705 --> 01:30:05,763
Yes. You too have a seat.

1607
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:11,608
Actually, we wanted to discuss
a very important matter with you.

1608
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,239
That's why we have come to meet you.

1609
01:30:14,481 --> 01:30:17,610
Okay, tell me, how I can help you.

1610
01:30:17,785 --> 01:30:22,621
Well, actually, her
sister has a problem.

1611
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:23,782
Yes, tell me.

1612
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:28,626
A married man from
India had gone to Canada.

1613
01:30:28,696 --> 01:30:31,666
He went there and got
married to her sister.

1614
01:30:31,732 --> 01:30:33,700
He stayed there for a short
period and after that.

1615
01:30:33,768 --> 01:30:37,727
...he stole all her money
and came back to India

1616
01:30:37,805 --> 01:30:39,705
He went missing after coming here.

1617
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:45,669
Okay. But how can I
help you in this matter?

1618
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:48,809
I am sure you must have lodged
a report in the police station.

1619
01:30:49,717 --> 01:30:51,742
Yes, we have lodged the complaint.

1620
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:56,620
And the fact is we have a slight
doubt about who that person is.

1621
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:59,660
We just want to confirm it.

1622
01:30:59,794 --> 01:31:03,628
The problem is that
his wife is very nice.

1623
01:31:03,698 --> 01:31:05,757
When we look at his
wife we feel very sad.

1624
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:09,667
That's the confusion now,
what should we do now.

1625
01:31:09,737 --> 01:31:11,762
But is his wife aware about all this?

1626
01:31:11,839 --> 01:31:15,833
No. No, she is not aware of anything.

1627
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:22,613
But whenever it is confirmed
you please inform his wife.

1628
01:31:22,816 --> 01:31:24,807
Such a man should be shot dead.

1629
01:31:27,655 --> 01:31:29,749
Really, you mean that?

1630
01:31:30,858 --> 01:31:32,758
Are you telling the truth?

1631
01:31:33,794 --> 01:31:37,788
Yes, Anna, I'm telling thetruth.
Such a man should be shot dead.

1632
01:31:41,202 --> 01:31:44,934
You have relieved me
from a great burden.

1633
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,652
Anna, I think we should move.

1634
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:49,643
Thank you so much.

1635
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,768
We are getting late. Let's go, Anna

1636
01:31:52,246 --> 01:31:54,908
You please be seated. Have some tea

1637
01:31:55,049 --> 01:31:58,178
Next time. We will leave.
We shall take your leave now.

1638
01:31:58,452 --> 01:32:00,352
Okay, thank you so much.

1639
01:32:19,773 --> 01:32:21,707
Why don't you sit down?

1640
01:32:21,775 --> 01:32:23,607
Your daughter is not
going to come back"

1641
01:32:23,677 --> 01:32:24,838
...if you walk around like this.

1642
01:32:25,779 --> 01:32:28,805
Okay, tell me, does it look
nice to leave your own house..

1643
01:32:28,883 --> 01:32:30,783
"And go and live in
somebody else's house?

1644
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:33,785
After all she is your daughter.
She is stubborn like her father.

1645
01:32:33,854 --> 01:32:37,722
She said that she will come
only after she selects a boy.

1646
01:32:37,792 --> 01:32:40,625
Are the boys found hanging on
the trees in lnder Kaur's garden?

1647
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:42,695
Is she going to pluck one
of them and bring home to us?

1648
01:32:43,664 --> 01:32:45,792
Why didn't she see the boy
the onel had selected for her?

1649
01:32:45,866 --> 01:32:49,632
Leave aside the good or bad
points of a boy selected by you..

1650
01:32:49,703 --> 01:32:51,671
...when she came to know
about the money marten.

1651
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:52,729
...she refused to meet any of them.

1652
01:32:52,807 --> 01:32:54,673
I'm sure you must have told about it.

1653
01:32:54,742 --> 01:32:55,834
Otherwise how would she
come to know about it?

1654
01:32:56,677 --> 01:32:59,738
Sometimes I feel like giving two
slaps to you and your son as well.

1655
01:32:59,814 --> 01:33:03,614
Listen to me very carefully. If you
ever raise your hand on me again..

1656
01:33:03,717 --> 01:33:09,588
...you will get twice as payback.
You will not be able to bear it.

1657
01:33:09,723 --> 01:33:13,660
Why don't you leash me
and tie me near the door?

1658
01:33:14,628 --> 01:33:18,826
Give me food twice in a day. You
have made me a dog in my own house.

1659
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:26,641
This man has done only
bad deeds all his life.

1660
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:29,309
Now he says I have made him a dog.

1661
01:33:30,844 --> 01:33:34,803
I really feel sorry for Ms. Hoopinder.

1662
01:33:34,882 --> 01:33:36,714
She is such a nice lady
and such unfortunate thing"

1663
01:33:36,784 --> 01:33:38,718
...is happening with her.

1664
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:43,750
For once I thought forget
it, let bygones be bygones.

1665
01:33:44,692 --> 01:33:47,787
But Kuku says, the
culprit should be punished.

1666
01:33:47,862 --> 01:33:51,730
He is absolutely right. Don't
leave him. Do you understand?

1667
01:33:51,799 --> 01:33:54,598
But we don't have any proof with us.

1668
01:33:54,668 --> 01:33:57,831
You are helping me a lot. And I..

1669
01:33:58,672 --> 01:34:00,800
Hello, madam, no need to say thank you.

1670
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:05,704
As it is a Punjabi has
cheated your sister.

1671
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:09,808
So it's the duty of all
us Puniabis to help you.

1672
01:34:09,884 --> 01:34:11,750
Do you follow?

1673
01:34:13,621 --> 01:34:18,635
Okay, tell me one thing,
have you taken any decision..

1674
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:20,650
"About Deep and Jashn?

1675
01:34:20,728 --> 01:34:23,754
I think Jashn, too, loves you.

1676
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:28,769
Strange, you see love
in Jashn's eyes for me.

1677
01:34:28,836 --> 01:34:31,806
But didn't you notice love
for you in Kuku's eyes?

1678
01:34:34,809 --> 01:34:38,712
I have, but Sahei, I might"

1679
01:34:38,779 --> 01:34:39,803
What "
 might"?

1680
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,611
He loved somebody else before.

1681
01:34:42,816 --> 01:34:45,649
He couldn't get the one he
love, he was heartbroken.

1682
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:49,815
And he still has not forgotten her.

1683
01:34:50,724 --> 01:34:54,752
I cannot break his heart.

have to go back to my country.

1684
01:34:55,696 --> 01:34:56,720
I belong to a different country.

1685
01:34:56,797 --> 01:34:58,765
Hello madam,what are you
talking about countries?

1686
01:34:58,832 --> 01:35:00,823
You don't fall in love after
seeing which couniry one belongs to.

1687
01:35:01,669 --> 01:35:06,698
You just fall in love. That too without
thinking and considering anything.

1688
01:35:06,774 --> 01:35:07,764
I hope you understand me?

1689
01:35:07,841 --> 01:35:12,745
Kuku is very nice and decent
person. I just can't break his heart.

1690
01:35:13,814 --> 01:35:17,682
Yes, if he is iilted in
love for the second tim e..

1691
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:21,585
...he might not be able
to bear this pain again.

1692
01:35:24,391 --> 01:35:26,803
Sahe], slowly, my child.

1693
01:35:26,827 --> 01:35:30,764
Look here, Anna Head this

1694
01:35:30,965 --> 01:35:33,696
Get up.
-Came

1695
01:35:33,768 --> 01:35:35,736
It means get up in Punjabi. Get up.

1696
01:35:35,803 --> 01:35:37,781
Get up?
- You be seated.

1697
01:35:37,805 --> 01:35:40,672
Camel. Camel.

1698
01:35:40,741 --> 01:35:41,731
Camel.
- Yes.

1699
01:35:41,809 --> 01:35:43,641
Yes, camel.
- Camel.

1700
01:35:43,711 --> 01:35:44,701
Hello, aunt.

1701
01:35:44,778 --> 01:35:46,610
Hello.
- Hi, Anna

1702
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:46,771
Hello.

1703
01:35:46,847 --> 01:35:48,679
Hi, Sahe].

1704
01:35:48,749 --> 01:35:49,739
How come you are here?

1705
01:35:49,817 --> 01:35:51,615
Jagtar dropped you here?

1706
01:35:51,685 --> 01:35:53,779
Jagtar had some work, I
took the bus and came here.

1707
01:35:53,854 --> 01:35:55,720
You could have called me up.

1708
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:56,780
'If Ilhy would you come to pick me up'?

1709
01:35:56,857 --> 01:35:59,724
No, I would have also
suggested you to come by bus.

1710
01:36:00,694 --> 01:36:01,718
You are great.

1711
01:36:01,796 --> 01:36:04,629
Okay, you have a cup of tea and I.. Anna

1712
01:36:04,698 --> 01:36:05,460
Anna

1713
01:36:05,633 --> 01:36:06,725
Anna
- Yes, what happened?

1714
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,824
Keep all your papers ready
we have to go and meet..

1715
01:36:08,235 --> 01:36:09,760
...a very important person today.
- Okay.

1716
01:36:09,837 --> 01:36:11,805
It's very important. Okay.
Keep all the papers ready.

1717
01:36:11,872 --> 01:36:13,670
The doctor has comel
will go and meet him.

1718
01:36:13,741 --> 01:36:14,640
Okay, fine.

1719
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:15,834
I'll get tea for you, brother.

1720
01:36:16,644 --> 01:36:18,635
You let it be. Aunt,
you make tea for me.

1721
01:36:18,712 --> 01:36:19,770
God save me from her te

1722
01:36:20,648 --> 01:36:22,639
Be careful. Don't pop his eyes out.

1723
01:36:22,717 --> 01:36:24,742
You keep the water
boiling. I will make the te

1724
01:36:25,753 --> 01:36:26,763
You are very dangerous.

1725
01:36:26,787 --> 01:36:29,722
Come on. You are so mischievous.

1726
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:31,724
Broiher troubles me a lot.

1727
01:36:32,826 --> 01:36:34,624
Hi.
- Hi.

1728
01:36:36,664 --> 01:36:38,598
The weather is good.
- Yes.

1729
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:41,636
Well, if you don't like this cot,
I will get another one for you.

1730
01:36:41,702 --> 01:36:42,760
Please be seated.

1731
01:36:42,836 --> 01:36:44,770
Sit down.
- Okay.

1732
01:36:48,876 --> 01:36:51,777
I feel you have liked this place.

1733
01:36:53,681 --> 01:36:54,705
Your family members
don't tell you anything?

1734
01:36:54,782 --> 01:36:57,581
No, papa is very angry with me.

1735
01:36:57,651 --> 01:37:00,643
But I can't leave my friend alone.

1736
01:37:00,721 --> 01:37:04,715
As it is we are helping her so much.

1737
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:09,652
Tell me, whom are you
going to meet today?

1738
01:37:09,797 --> 01:37:11,731
One of my friends.

1739
01:37:11,799 --> 01:37:14,791
He is a police inspector but he's
suspended since the last six months.

1740
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:17,761
Punishment for being loyal and honest.

1741
01:37:18,806 --> 01:37:22,800
So, do you also believe that the
loyal and honest always get punished?

1742
01:37:23,778 --> 01:37:25,610
That's what happens.

1743
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,807
People feel good about
lies and fake and..

1744
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:29,706
...think that an honest person is a fool.

1745
01:37:29,784 --> 01:37:32,776
So, despite knowing everything
you also believe in the same thing.

1746
01:37:32,853 --> 01:37:34,719
Why is it so'?

1747
01:37:35,723 --> 01:37:36,713
Tea

1748
01:37:37,758 --> 01:37:40,659
I didn't make the tea,
brother, aunt has made it.

1749
01:37:40,794 --> 01:37:42,728
Have it.

1750
01:37:44,798 --> 01:37:48,779
I'm sorry, Jashn. If you don't
want to tell then please don't.

1751
01:37:48,803 --> 01:37:49,736
It's your wish.

1752
01:37:49,804 --> 01:37:51,738
It's not like that, Sahei.

1753
01:37:52,807 --> 01:37:56,835
I believe that a single truth is
stronger than a thousand lies.

1754
01:37:57,878 --> 01:38:00,677
As it is everybody knows
everything about me.

1755
01:38:01,882 --> 01:38:03,816
People made fun of me in the college.

1756
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:08,617
But I even met a few peoplewho
didn't look at my background.

1757
01:38:08,689 --> 01:38:09,679
They saw only me.

1758
01:38:09,757 --> 01:38:12,590
And Kuku is one of them.

1759
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,719
Kuku is a very nice human-being.

1760
01:38:14,795 --> 01:38:18,754
If he is doing so much for
Anna, so he can help anybody.

1761
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:21,700
And whatever you are doing for Anna,
only very few people can do that.

1762
01:38:21,769 --> 01:38:24,670
Okay, stop talking about me.
Shall I ask you something?

1763
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:27,674
Why don't you take up a job?

1764
01:38:27,741 --> 01:38:30,767
I mean you should take up
some job or do a business.

1765
01:38:31,645 --> 01:38:34,774
Your parent's might look for a
girl for marriage for you in future.

1766
01:38:35,649 --> 01:38:38,812
The girl's family will ask what
the boy is doing. What 'then?

1767
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:44,781
My mother is no more and
my father is illiterate.

1768
01:38:46,694 --> 01:38:48,662
He lived all his life
as a live in son-in-law.

1769
01:38:49,663 --> 01:38:50,755
A character everyone can joke about.

1770
01:38:53,634 --> 01:38:54,726
I can never get married.

1771
01:38:54,802 --> 01:38:58,761
What if a girl loves you and
you also love her, not even then?

1772
01:38:58,839 --> 01:39:01,809
You too areioking with
me, the way everybody does.

1773
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:05,789
Jashn, I am not joking.
I'm asking you seriously.

1774
01:39:05,813 --> 01:39:09,613
If you love a girl and
the girl also loves you.

1775
01:39:09,683 --> 01:39:10,582
Not even then?

1776
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:12,642
Yes, I do love her.

1777
01:39:13,621 --> 01:39:17,649
For the first time in my lifel saw
a girl and felt liketalking with her.

1778
01:39:18,726 --> 01:39:21,593
But I don't know what's in her heart.

1779
01:39:21,862 --> 01:39:25,594
The day she says yes I'll not step back.

1780
01:39:25,766 --> 01:39:30,727
Because that's my nature. Once if
I go forward, I never go back off.

1781
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:35,672
Shall we leave, Jashn Singh?

1782
01:39:36,043 --> 01:39:39,138
Anna, come, we are getting late now. Anna

1783
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:40,371
Yes, coming.

1784
01:39:40,814 --> 01:39:43,249
Sahe], you were saying
that you wanted to go home.

1785
01:39:43,651 --> 01:39:44,618
So shall we drop you on the way?

1786
01:39:44,685 --> 01:39:47,711
No, Gary is coming to pick me
up. I'll come in 'lhe evening.

1787
01:39:47,788 --> 01:39:48,653
Sure?

1788
01:39:48,722 --> 01:39:49,382
Yes.

1789
01:39:49,657 --> 01:39:50,749
Okay, then, we shall leave now. Come on.

1790
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:52,683
Bye.

1791
01:40:00,801 --> 01:40:03,793
'The day she says yes
I'll not step back.'

1792
01:40:04,705 --> 01:40:09,700
'Because that's my nature. Once
if I go forward, I don't back off.'

1793
01:40:17,018 --> 01:40:18,952
Hello, Deep.
- Hello.

1794
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:20,953
How are you, Sukhi?
- Fine, brother.

1795
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:23,786
Go, get it. - I
will. - Jagtar.

1796
01:40:24,325 --> 01:40:26,123
Why'? 'What happened?

1797
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:30,130
He left early in the
morning. Something is fishy.

1798
01:40:30,364 --> 01:40:32,298
I have seen a lot of lover boys.

1799
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:37,169
I can see a glimpse of
Han]ha's esirangem ent..

1800
01:40:37,237 --> 01:40:41,117
"And Mirza's sadness and
MahiwaPs restless in his eyes.

1801
01:40:41,141 --> 01:40:45,169
Scoundrel, you flunked
Punjab literature in college.

1802
01:40:45,246 --> 01:40:47,214
From where did you get these details?

1803
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:48,271
From where did you get
the overhauling done?

1804
01:40:48,348 --> 01:40:53,081
No overhauling, I am just laughing
at these lovers' stupidity.

1805
01:40:53,153 --> 01:40:55,087
Look, first Haniha got his ears
pierced, renouncing material world.

1806
01:40:55,155 --> 01:40:56,316
Then he grazed cattle for 12 years.

1807
01:40:57,124 --> 01:40:59,149
But let see what our Haniha does.

1808
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:01,285
My boy, you too are after that girl.

1809
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:06,097
Brother, I am trying my luck.
Let's see if I get lucky.

1810
01:41:06,233 --> 01:41:07,291
Otherwise, I'll look for
someone else, or someone else.

1811
01:41:08,135 --> 01:41:09,261
Or someone else.

1812
01:41:09,336 --> 01:41:11,270
I will find someone for myself.

1813
01:41:11,339 --> 01:41:14,274
Just write nice dialogues for me.

1814
01:41:14,342 --> 01:41:16,208
I want to recite them to Sahe].

1815
01:41:16,277 --> 01:41:18,177
Those dialogues were very good.

1816
01:41:18,245 --> 01:41:20,111
But nowadays, it needs..

1817
01:41:20,181 --> 01:41:21,307
It needs to be up there. Up there.

1818
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:23,241
Here, hold this wrench.
- A wrench?

1819
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:26,149
And go under the car.
- Who? Me?

1820
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:30,282
No, your father.
- Laali. Get our workshop's shirt.

1821
01:41:32,126 --> 01:41:34,304
Here, wear it.
- Brother, there are so many boys here.

1822
01:41:34,328 --> 01:41:36,194
You can send anyone in there.

1823
01:41:36,263 --> 01:41:38,322
My boy, don't you want me to write dialogues for you?
- Yes.

1824
01:41:39,132 --> 01:41:40,293
Don't you want to drink beer?
- Yes.

1825
01:41:40,368 --> 01:41:42,302
Get under it. Open the filter.

1826
01:41:42,369 --> 01:41:45,202
That's it. This is how you blackmail me.

1827
01:41:45,272 --> 01:41:48,173
That's why I don't come here.
You make me do all the work.

1828
01:41:48,242 --> 01:41:50,336
He was giving me a
brief on Heer and Hanih

1829
01:41:51,145 --> 01:41:54,171
You are making me, a celibate,
write romantic dialogues.

1830
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:56,283
Brother, that's why I am
making your write them.

1831
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:59,081
There's a lot offire in you.
- Wait, you..

1832
01:42:12,233 --> 01:42:16,136
How are you, Jashn?
- Strange. How did you know it is me?

1833
01:42:16,203 --> 01:42:20,140
Shame on our friendship I can't
recognise my friend's touch.

1834
01:42:20,207 --> 01:42:22,141
We have been looking
for you since morning.

1835
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:24,235
Then I thought that it's
time for you to be here.

1836
01:42:24,312 --> 01:42:27,179
You must be here. Forget it. Meet Kuku.

1837
01:42:28,182 --> 01:42:30,310
Hello, brother.
- Hello, brother.

1838
01:42:31,251 --> 01:42:33,276
How are you? - Anna-
She's here from Canada

1839
01:42:34,121 --> 01:42:35,145
Hi.
- Nice meeting you.

1840
01:42:35,222 --> 01:42:38,301
Kuku, Jashn always talk
about you when we meet.

1841
01:42:38,325 --> 01:42:40,157
Kulcu is like this. Kuku is like 'lhat.

1842
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:43,162
Now I feel I know you very well.

1843
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:46,165
He also tells me about you quite often.

1844
01:42:46,233 --> 01:42:48,099
That I got suspended?

1845
01:42:50,237 --> 01:42:53,298
Forget all this. Firsi
tell me, what you will have.

1846
01:42:55,142 --> 01:42:57,304
I get half my salary.
That's enough for me.

1847
01:42:58,145 --> 01:43:01,308
I can afford it.
- We will be having something today, brother.

1848
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:04,277
But what we want is your help.
- My help?

1849
01:43:05,252 --> 01:43:10,190
Suspended sub-inspector
Viiay Singh Chauhan.

1850
01:43:10,357 --> 01:43:14,157
Mr. Chauhan, when active
officers can't help people..

1851
01:43:14,228 --> 01:43:17,129
...suspended officers
come to their rescue.

1852
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:20,190
Wiay, we really need your help.

1853
01:43:20,301 --> 01:43:22,201
Now only you can guide us.

1854
01:43:22,269 --> 01:43:24,294
God is the one who guides everyone.

1855
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:26,300
Still let me know what the problem is.

1856
01:43:27,207 --> 01:43:29,119
Then I will seewhatl can do.

1857
01:43:29,143 --> 01:43:30,269
No one can do anything.

1858
01:43:30,344 --> 01:43:32,312
You saw? They left you
alone and went somewhere"

1859
01:43:33,146 --> 01:43:35,171
...so late in the night
because of that Wiay.

1860
01:43:35,249 --> 01:43:38,082
Why should we feel
scared in our own village?

1861
01:43:38,152 --> 01:43:40,246
And then,
 stay alone
for many days at a stretch.

1862
01:43:40,321 --> 01:43:43,120
I am not scared of anyone.
Everyone is scared of me.

1863
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:46,125
Aunt, Viiay won't find anything.

1864
01:43:46,193 --> 01:43:48,218
He was a sub-inspecionHe
is suspended now.

1865
01:43:48,295 --> 01:43:50,093
He drinks all daylong.

1866
01:43:50,164 --> 01:43:52,132
And he fights with a
new officer everyday.

1867
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:55,111
Actually, he has been
bitten by a big of honesty.

1868
01:43:55,135 --> 01:43:58,105
And you know how dangerous that can be.

1869
01:43:58,172 --> 01:44:02,131
You mean a person should
be dishonest, right?

1870
01:44:02,276 --> 01:44:06,270
That's not what I mean. I
mean one needs to be practical.

1871
01:44:06,347 --> 01:44:07,314
Practical .

1872
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:10,083
Look, is it wrong to lie
or make some adjustments"

1873
01:44:10,184 --> 01:44:14,087
...to get one's work done, right?

1874
01:44:14,154 --> 01:44:18,091
You say that what I teach
children at school is wrong.

1875
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:20,149
I shouldn't teach
them to tell the truth.

1876
01:44:20,227 --> 01:44:23,106
Saw that? This is what
is wrong with girls.

1877
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:25,292
Aunt, they over-analyze
everything that is said.

1878
01:44:25,366 --> 01:44:28,199
Sahe], why did you start this with him?

1879
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:31,294
Now he just won't stop. He will
keep bringing up different points.

1880
01:44:32,139 --> 01:44:33,197
This is how he has always been.

1881
01:44:33,274 --> 01:44:36,141
Sit herewith him. I'll
go and get some hot milk.

1882
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:38,144
Aunt, first tell me, you
are on my side, right?

1883
01:44:38,212 --> 01:44:40,340
Aunt support the truth, got it?
- Yes. - Keep quiet. Sit down.

1884
01:44:42,183 --> 01:44:43,226
Hey..

1885
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:45,095
By the way, Deep, thank you.

1886
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:47,247
You showed m e the way
of how to stay in India

1887
01:44:47,321 --> 01:44:50,200
What's great in that? This
is how things wrong here.

1888
01:44:50,224 --> 01:44:54,218
I will stay in India now. So,

should learn how the system works here.

1889
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:57,195
What did you say? You are
not going back to Canada?

1890
01:44:57,265 --> 01:45:01,168
No, life there is very
hard. It's great over here.

1891
01:45:01,302 --> 01:45:04,114
Even idle people enjoy life here.

1892
01:45:04,138 --> 01:45:08,097
No, look, your parents have
spent a lot of money on you.

1893
01:45:08,242 --> 01:45:10,301
And you say you don't want
to go back. It's not right.

1894
01:45:11,145 --> 01:45:13,136
And life here isn't good,
life in Canada is great.

1895
01:45:13,213 --> 01:45:16,205
Forget it, Deep. You have
a bad time working there.

1896
01:45:16,283 --> 01:45:20,186
Here the onel marry will
work and I will enjoy my life.

1897
01:45:20,254 --> 01:45:22,222
Right, Vinnie?
- Right, Sahei.

1898
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:26,248
L, too, have decided not
to work after marriage.

1899
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:31,128
I will sit at home. He will earn. I will have fun.
- Yes.

1900
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:33,257
Okay. Fine. I'll make a move now, aunt.

1901
01:45:33,334 --> 01:45:36,304
Kuku will be here soon.
He must be on his way back.

1902
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:39,135
No. Drink the milk before you leave.

1903
01:45:39,206 --> 01:45:42,335
Actually, my stomach is
upset. I am getting cramps.

1904
01:45:43,143 --> 01:45:45,168
I won't be able to drink milk now.

1905
01:45:45,245 --> 01:45:47,213
Fine. I'll make a move now.
- Bye, Deep.

1906
01:45:47,281 --> 01:45:49,306
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1907
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:54,143
Girls, what's wrong with him?
He ran away all of a sudden.

1908
01:45:54,221 --> 01:45:57,282
Aunt, now he will have loose motions.

1909
01:45:59,293 --> 01:46:03,127
So, Mr. Ghauhan, this is the story.

1910
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:06,099
Now you tell us what we should do.

1911
01:46:06,267 --> 01:46:09,328
Wiay, reputation of
Puniabis is at stake.

1912
01:46:10,137 --> 01:46:13,129
This means the key to this
problem is with Uiagar Singh.

1913
01:46:14,341 --> 01:46:16,207
But what should we do now?

1914
01:46:16,277 --> 01:46:18,177
Let me think. Let me think.

1915
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,208
Look you need to use crooked
means to solve crooked cases.

1916
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:27,082
I am sorry, Viiay. But Tarsem is Balbir.

1917
01:46:27,154 --> 01:46:29,145
Don't worry. I know everything.

1918
01:46:29,223 --> 01:46:33,251
Look, no rules apply on a
suspended police officer.

1919
01:46:34,228 --> 01:46:37,323
And then how can they suspend
an already suspended officer?

1920
01:46:39,166 --> 01:46:43,194
So, you go home and
let me think over it.

1921
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:46,271
I will let you know
when I need you guys.

1922
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,140
Okay?
- Thank you, brother. Thank you very much.

1923
01:46:55,149 --> 01:46:56,310
Enough. Enough.

1924
01:46:57,285 --> 01:47:00,220
I need to go. I can't run anymore.

1925
01:47:00,288 --> 01:47:02,188
And there is water over here.

1926
01:47:02,289 --> 01:47:04,121
I know what you are talking about.

1927
01:47:04,191 --> 01:47:06,182
Why don't you say that you are out of breath?
- Yes.

1928
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:09,127
Your radiator has heated.
- What is it?

1929
01:47:09,196 --> 01:47:10,288
Go, continue running.

1930
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:14,101
It's so early in the
morning.
 am feeling cold.

1931
01:47:14,168 --> 01:47:16,159
You know how cold it gets in Canada?

1932
01:47:16,303 --> 01:47:19,295
Who is going to Canada?
- Why? What happened?

1933
01:47:20,308 --> 01:47:23,141
Sahei says that she doesn't
want to go back to Canada

1934
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:26,305
What do you mean? Sahei
isn't going back to Canada?

1935
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,314
No. She isn't.

1936
01:47:29,317 --> 01:47:33,151
Hear him talk. As if
he is engaged to her.

1937
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:37,157
Hello, she is impressed
with me. - Really? - Yes.

1938
01:47:37,224 --> 01:47:41,183
A little more effort by me and
she will agree to get engaged.

1939
01:47:41,262 --> 01:47:44,254
But what's the use now? She says
she doesn't want to go to Canada

1940
01:47:44,331 --> 01:47:46,163
She has spoilt my mood.

1941
01:47:46,233 --> 01:47:48,311
Where are my dialogues?
- Your dialogues?

1942
01:47:48,335 --> 01:47:51,100
Here you go.

1943
01:47:51,238 --> 01:47:52,296
You can.

1944
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:55,275
No. They might be useful to you.

1945
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:59,109
Hold this.
- Do one thing, you keep them with you.

1946
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:00,272
They might come in handy some place else.

1947
01:48:00,347 --> 01:48:02,247
I write my own dialogues.

1948
01:48:02,316 --> 01:48:06,082
That's fine, but I don't
understand one thing.

1949
01:48:06,153 --> 01:48:07,245
What kind of a girl is Sahei?

1950
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:08,288
She came back from Canada and..

1951
01:48:09,123 --> 01:48:10,113
...now she says she
doesn't want to go back.

1952
01:48:10,191 --> 01:48:12,091
It's hard to believe.

1953
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,184
It's like it happens in Punjabi movies.

1954
01:48:14,261 --> 01:48:16,252
It's okay. It happens. Don't feel sad.

1955
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:18,230
Okay? I have to go for an interview.

1956
01:48:18,299 --> 01:48:20,233
I am going there, see
you in the evening.

1957
01:48:22,203 --> 01:48:23,295
Idiot.

1958
01:48:25,172 --> 01:48:29,302
Look, Sahei, parents are bound
to worry about their children.

1959
01:48:30,244 --> 01:48:34,238
It's not wrong for your father
to worry about your marriage.

1960
01:48:35,182 --> 01:48:37,116
He called me up.

1961
01:48:37,184 --> 01:48:40,119
He said his daughter
has come from Canada.

1962
01:48:40,188 --> 01:48:42,122
...and is staying at
someone else's house.

1963
01:48:42,189 --> 01:48:44,180
This is giving him a bad reputation.

1964
01:48:44,258 --> 01:48:50,106
Okay, aunt. We will leave
if you are tired of us.

1965
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:52,121
But still, I won't go to my house.

1966
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,293
Becausel know my father very well.

1967
01:48:54,368 --> 01:48:59,238
Aunt, he is very stubborn.
He does what he decides upon.

1968
01:48:59,306 --> 01:49:01,240
You aren't any less stubborn.

1969
01:49:01,308 --> 01:49:03,174
You are welcome to stay over here.

1970
01:49:03,277 --> 01:49:05,245
I am happy that you
guys are staying here.

1971
01:49:05,313 --> 01:49:07,281
Look how happy Kuku is.

1972
01:49:07,348 --> 01:49:10,215
He used to stay sad all daylong.

1973
01:49:10,284 --> 01:49:14,084
Aunt, I know why Kuku used
to stay sad earlier and..

1974
01:49:14,154 --> 01:49:16,282
...why does he look happy now.

1975
01:49:17,258 --> 01:49:19,158
Aunt, try and understand.

1976
01:49:19,226 --> 01:49:22,252
Anna is the reason behind his happiness.

1977
01:49:23,164 --> 01:49:27,226
Yes, this fear is troubling me as well.

1978
01:49:29,303 --> 01:49:35,140
Talk to Kuku. Look, Anna
has come from abroad.

1979
01:49:35,342 --> 01:49:38,141
She will go back to her count-y.

1980
01:49:38,378 --> 01:49:41,245
And Kulcu will once again
be in the same state.

1981
01:49:42,249 --> 01:49:45,184
Earlier as well he had used
liquor to drown his sadness.

1982
01:49:45,252 --> 01:49:48,222
That's it then, liquor
was the only solution.

1983
01:49:49,223 --> 01:49:51,214
But that's not a solution.

1984
01:49:52,226 --> 01:49:57,096
I know, but it helps you
forget things for a while.

1985
01:49:57,164 --> 01:49:59,258
You know, when apatient is in pain..

1986
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:02,166
"Doctor inject painkillers
to kill the pain for awhile.

1987
01:50:02,236 --> 01:50:05,228
So, liquor helps kill the
pain in the heart for awhile.

1988
01:50:05,305 --> 01:50:07,296
No. This is so wrong.

1989
01:50:08,242 --> 01:50:12,222
It was your fault that you
didn't tell her "
 love you."

1990
01:50:12,246 --> 01:50:16,274
Make sure to tell the girl you love her.

1991
01:50:17,251 --> 01:50:19,083
How will you say it?

1992
01:50:21,255 --> 01:50:23,280
Hey, look at me.

1993
01:50:24,124 --> 01:50:25,148
Look here.

1994
01:50:26,127 --> 01:50:27,185
Go,man.

1995
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:30,291
Hey, look here.

1996
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:36,091
I can't say it.
- Then how will get any girl?

1997
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:38,332
How will she know that you love her?

1998
01:50:40,208 --> 01:50:41,300
She doesn't know.

1999
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:44,310
You, too, will leave me some day.

2000
01:50:45,212 --> 01:50:46,338
You said something?

2001
01:50:48,282 --> 01:50:52,082
I said.. we are getling late. Let's go.

2002
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:54,151
We'll talk about it later.

2003
01:50:54,221 --> 01:51:00,126
Kuku, you know what? You are impossible.

2004
01:51:00,327 --> 01:51:05,094
If I ask him to get married, he refuses.

2005
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:10,137
L, too, thought why deceive any girl?

2006
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:15,141
And what's the use of 'the marriage
if both of them stay unhappy?

2007
01:51:15,275 --> 01:51:18,210
Anyway, forget about him.
Tell me about yourself.

2008
01:51:18,278 --> 01:51:20,178
What are you thinking about?

2009
01:51:20,247 --> 01:51:22,181
Aunt, what's there for me to think?

2010
01:51:22,249 --> 01:51:24,149
Hear that? What does that mean?

2011
01:51:24,218 --> 01:51:25,242
You won't think of anything.

2012
01:51:25,319 --> 01:51:27,083
You won't let your
father think about it.

2013
01:51:27,154 --> 01:51:29,088
Then what do you wish to do?

2014
01:51:29,156 --> 01:51:33,218
Aunt, by the way, I like a boy.

2015
01:51:33,293 --> 01:51:36,263
And I feel he, too, likes me.

2016
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:39,197
But papa won't agree for our alliance.

2017
01:51:39,266 --> 01:51:41,166
Hey, leave that to me.

2018
01:51:41,235 --> 01:51:45,297
Forget your father, I can
convince his father as well.

2019
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:48,302
But aunt, grandpa
passed away 10 years ago.

2020
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:53,336
Shut up. I mean it's my
responsibility to convince your father.

2021
01:51:54,148 --> 01:51:57,118
Tell me, who is that boy?

2022
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,096
I will tell you, aunt. I will tell you.

2023
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:02,090
But first, let me talk to him.

2024
01:52:12,233 --> 01:52:14,133
<i>3:99'-.</i>

2025
01:52:14,201 --> 01:52:17,262
Where is Jagta“?
- Brother, he must be under 'lhe ca'.

2026
01:52:17,338 --> 01:52:19,238
I am here.

2027
01:52:20,141 --> 01:52:21,233
How are you, man?

2028
01:52:21,308 --> 01:52:22,332
Sorry, man.

2029
01:52:23,144 --> 01:52:24,120
What is it? Why are you alone?

2030
01:52:24,144 --> 01:52:26,238
Where's Deep?
- Where will Deep go?

2031
01:52:26,313 --> 01:52:29,112
What does a hunter dog
do? Look for a pray.

2032
01:52:29,183 --> 01:52:31,277
He will keep looking for a
pray, you have a look at the car.

2033
01:52:31,351 --> 01:52:33,183
It is giving jerks since yesterday.

2034
01:52:33,254 --> 01:52:35,222
You are destined to
get jerks all your life.

2035
01:52:35,289 --> 01:52:37,155
Some jerks will be given by it as well.

2036
01:52:37,225 --> 01:52:39,125
Sell this trash and buy a nice car.

2037
01:52:39,193 --> 01:52:43,130
Listen, older the liquor
the better it tastes.

2038
01:52:43,197 --> 01:52:45,188
The older the friendship the better.

2039
01:52:45,266 --> 01:52:46,324
Then why isn't it same
with the car as well?

2040
01:52:47,134 --> 01:52:48,124
Let me tell you.

2041
01:52:48,202 --> 01:52:51,194
A new car is like a new girlfriend.

2042
01:52:52,206 --> 01:52:56,219
As it gets older it starts
troubling like an old girlfriend.

2043
01:52:56,243 --> 01:52:58,321
Girls have to feature in
all their conversations.

2044
01:52:58,345 --> 01:53:01,280
These boys can't think about
anything other than girls.

2045
01:53:01,348 --> 01:53:03,260
Jagtar, relax, cool.

2046
01:53:03,284 --> 01:53:07,278
Look, with great difficulty
has our friend found love.

2047
01:53:07,354 --> 01:53:10,085
You are say such things
and making him homeless.

2048
01:53:10,157 --> 01:53:11,215
He is the silent-type.

2049
01:53:11,292 --> 01:53:14,262
He keeps his mouth shut when
a girl is standing before him.

2050
01:53:14,328 --> 01:53:15,295
What will he do?

2051
01:53:15,362 --> 01:53:20,198
Look the silent-types like
him are like a devil's tail.

2052
01:53:21,168 --> 01:53:23,136
If you love the girl, get on
the terrace, play the drums..

2053
01:53:23,204 --> 01:53:26,230
"And announce it to the
world. Close the topic.

2054
01:53:27,141 --> 01:53:29,235
He too? Who is he involved with?

2055
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:31,221
The one from Canada, Seine].

2056
01:53:31,245 --> 01:53:34,215
Forget it. She is a
very tough nut to crack.

2057
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:38,094
Jagtar, you are surrounded
by machines all daylong.

2058
01:53:38,118 --> 01:53:40,096
You don't know what's happening outside.

2059
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:43,146
She is signalling him,that's
why things are progressing.

2060
01:53:43,224 --> 01:53:46,303
Oh I see. His alignment is already done.

2061
01:53:46,327 --> 01:53:49,126
And here, the expert of
cars has no clue about it.

2062
01:53:49,196 --> 01:53:53,099
Look, Jagtar, don't tell
anything to Deep as yet.

2063
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,200
Nothing is confirmed as yet.

2064
01:53:55,269 --> 01:54:00,207
I feel Sahei too.. But..
but nothing is confirmed.

2065
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:02,165
It will affect our 'friendship.

2066
01:54:03,277 --> 01:54:07,180
Jashn, a friendship that falls apart
was not strong enough to begin with.

2067
01:54:07,248 --> 01:54:10,227
Deep was after her because
she was going to Canada- Yes.

2068
01:54:10,251 --> 01:54:12,083
And now she isn't going to Canada

2069
01:54:12,219 --> 01:54:14,244
She said so to test Deep.

2070
01:54:15,122 --> 01:54:18,285
But.. but look, nothing
is confirm ed, man.

2071
01:54:18,359 --> 01:54:21,192
If it isn't confirmed then confirm it.

2072
01:54:21,262 --> 01:54:24,254
Otherwise, give up everything and
come with me to Hanumen temple.

2073
01:54:26,333 --> 01:54:30,133
"
 wi

.."
- Sir, should I also get half empty bottle?

2074
01:54:30,304 --> 01:54:32,295
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

2075
01:54:34,141 --> 01:54:37,202
My wife.. is a very religious woman.

2076
01:54:38,212 --> 01:54:41,204
Very religious.

2077
01:54:41,282 --> 01:54:49,121
No meat, chicken, fish, eggs,
liquor is allowed inside the house.

2078
01:54:49,223 --> 01:54:53,091
So, sir, you won't
be going home tonight.

2079
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:55,205
Then will I be going to yours?

2080
01:54:55,229 --> 01:54:58,308
No, I mean, sir, you have
half a bottle of liquor..

2081
01:54:58,332 --> 01:55:02,200
...and four chicken legs inside you.

2082
01:55:02,303 --> 01:55:04,294
So how can you go to your house?

2083
01:55:05,339 --> 01:55:09,173
Keep quiet. Keep quiet. Don't blabber.

2084
01:55:09,243 --> 01:55:13,271
Take the bottle with you.
- I don't drink, sir.

2085
01:55:14,148 --> 01:55:18,210
Then give it to someone
else. Don't argue with me.

2086
01:55:18,285 --> 01:55:21,118
Sir, should I drive you home?

2087
01:55:21,188 --> 01:55:24,300
I will drive it. I know how to drive it.

2088
01:55:24,324 --> 01:55:27,123
Don't talk nonsense.

2089
01:55:27,194 --> 01:55:31,256
"Click a photo of me dancing."

2090
01:55:31,332 --> 01:55:36,133
"Click.. click a photo of me dancing."

2091
01:55:36,204 --> 01:55:44,112
"Click a photon"

2092
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:46,280
"Click.

2093
01:55:47,181 --> 01:55:49,240
"Click.

2094
01:55:49,316 --> 01:55:53,116
"Click.

2095
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:56,255
"Click.

2096
01:55:58,192 --> 01:56:00,092
Quietly drive the car.

2097
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:02,126
Drive it to a place I want you to.

2098
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:08,131
Viiay, you? You still
crack such funny jokes.

2099
01:56:08,202 --> 01:56:11,137
I am notioking. I am serious.

2100
01:56:11,205 --> 01:56:13,299
And you know when I am serious.

2101
01:56:14,141 --> 01:56:18,271
You are right. Anyway,
I don'tlikeiokes.

2102
01:56:18,345 --> 01:56:20,245
Drive.

2103
01:56:21,148 --> 01:56:23,242
Okay. I will drive it.

2104
01:56:27,121 --> 01:56:30,147
Answer it. Jashn. Your phone is ringing.

2105
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:34,254
Jashn, answer the phone. Hey..

2106
01:56:37,331 --> 01:56:39,197
'Where is he'?

2107
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,166
Damn..

2108
01:56:42,336 --> 01:56:46,102
Listen to me. Meet me at the
Royal restaurant at 11 o'clock.

2109
01:56:46,173 --> 01:56:48,141
Got it? Listen, I want to tell
you someihing very important.

2110
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:51,144
Don't tell anyone. And
don't bring anyone along.

2111
01:56:51,212 --> 01:56:52,304
Okay.
- Bye.

2112
01:57:06,127 --> 01:57:08,221
Sahei has asked you to
meet her at Royal Castle.

2113
01:57:09,196 --> 01:57:11,255
And she has also said not
to tell anything to anyone.

2114
01:57:11,332 --> 01:57:13,232
Shewants to discuss something
very important with you.

2115
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:16,212
Hence I don't know that
you have gone there.

2116
01:57:16,236 --> 01:57:19,262
You didn't tell her that it's
not Jashn, but Deep on the line?

2117
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:22,302

would've said something if
she would've given me a chance.

2118
01:57:23,143 --> 01:57:25,305
She doesn't stop once she begins.

2119
01:57:27,281 --> 01:57:29,272
By the way, what is this is about?

2120
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:33,086
And remember one thing, my friend.

2121
01:57:33,154 --> 01:57:35,282
She isn't going back to Canada

2122
01:57:36,157 --> 01:57:38,182
You are a schmuck.

2123
01:57:38,259 --> 01:57:41,229
What did you say? I didn't
get it. What's a shuck?

2124
01:57:41,295 --> 01:57:44,265
Schmuck. It means

2125
01:57:44,332 --> 01:57:47,233
Abuse me properly. Say, you..

2126
01:57:47,301 --> 01:57:51,295
What's the use if you have to use a
dictionary to know what an abuse means?

2127
01:57:52,273 --> 01:57:54,207
Anyway, all the best.

2128
01:57:55,343 --> 01:58:01,282
Deep, tell me the truth, will
you feel bad if I go meet her?

2129
01:58:02,349 --> 01:58:07,287
People say that a friendship breaks
if a girl comes in the middle.

2130
01:58:08,288 --> 01:58:13,089
Oh, my noble schmuck. We are
friends like in the movie 'Sholay'.

2131
01:58:13,327 --> 01:58:17,161
We should even sing a song with
that extra cart on the bike.

2132
01:58:17,231 --> 01:58:19,256
Don't worry. I will come with you.

2133
01:58:19,333 --> 01:58:21,301
No. She has asked not to bring anyone.

2134
01:58:21,369 --> 01:58:24,304
She has, really? I said I will
go with you, that means I will.

2135
01:58:27,241 --> 01:58:31,235
Brother, Uiagar is
missing since late night.

2136
01:58:32,212 --> 01:58:35,147
Yes, his wife had come in the morning
enquiring about his whereabouts.

2137
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:37,247
They said they found
his car near the river.

2138
01:58:37,751 --> 01:58:39,241
Brother, then you should
ask the department.

2139
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,186
...if any dead body
has been washes ashore.

2140
01:58:41,255 --> 01:58:44,122
By the way, brother,
he won't commit suicide.

2141
01:58:44,191 --> 01:58:46,159
There's a possible that
someone must have murdered him..

2142
01:58:46,227 --> 01:58:47,285
...and throw him in the river.

2143
01:58:47,795 --> 01:58:51,595
It will be great if someone
has taken care of him.

2144
01:58:52,266 --> 01:58:54,200
Tarsem Singh, such people
don't die so quickly.

2145
01:58:54,268 --> 01:58:56,212
Really? They take time?

2146
01:58:56,236 --> 01:59:00,104
I mean then we shouldn't
be so happy about it.

2147
01:59:00,941 --> 01:59:02,238
We have that issue with that foreigner.

2148
01:59:02,309 --> 01:59:04,334
And you are saying that
Uiagar won't die so easily.

2149
01:59:05,246 --> 01:59:10,327
Brother, then, we should pray that
someone should've taken care of him.

2150
01:59:10,351 --> 01:59:13,082
Otherwise he would have troubled us.

2151
01:59:13,154 --> 01:59:16,089
I don't understand
one thing. Where is he?

2152
01:59:16,323 --> 01:59:19,384
I can eat only once you untie my hands.

2153
01:59:21,929 --> 01:59:23,829
The apple is not for eating"

2154
01:59:25,967 --> 01:59:27,833
But for target practice.

2155
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:34,206
No, Wiay, don't. Brother. Brother.

2156
01:59:36,244 --> 01:59:40,272
Tell me the truth. Who is Balbir?

2157
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:43,415
And how did he get a passport?

2158
01:59:43,517 --> 01:59:46,578
Sir, it's been six since
months since you practiced.

2159
01:59:47,288 --> 01:59:49,299
Careful you might hit Uiagar
Singh at the wrong place.

2160
01:59:49,323 --> 01:59:51,291
No, Viiay. No.

2161
01:59:54,895 --> 01:59:57,865
<i>Tasem is BaMnTarsem is Bdbir.</i>

2162
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:05,369
I made a false verification
report and got his passport made.

2163
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:09,599
I did all this at Harnam Singh's behest

2164
02:00:10,378 --> 02:00:14,281
I seized Dasvinder Singh's land as well.

2165
02:00:14,482 --> 02:00:17,417
He was after Tarsem.

2166
02:00:18,786 --> 02:00:23,451
Harnam Singh sent Tarsem to Canada

2167
02:00:23,690 --> 02:00:31,689
After a few months we got
Dasonda killed in an accident.

2168
02:00:32,733 --> 02:00:33,791
Dalbir.
- Sir.

2169
02:00:33,868 --> 02:00:34,994
That's great.

2170
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:38,429
I hit right on target
even after six months.

2171
02:00:40,174 --> 02:00:41,335
I am worried.

2172
02:00:42,543 --> 02:00:43,567
Place another apple.

2173
02:00:46,614 --> 02:00:48,514
Why another one?

2174
02:00:48,582 --> 02:00:51,916
I told you the truth about everyone.

2175
02:00:53,153 --> 02:00:56,214
No, brother. No.

2176
02:00:57,458 --> 02:01:05,458
If your hand shivers even a bit
my children will become orphans.

2177
02:01:07,902 --> 02:01:10,701
Even Dasonda Singh had children.

2178
02:01:11,372 --> 02:01:13,238
You didn't feel any pity back then.

2179
02:01:16,844 --> 02:01:20,474
Sir, Uiagar Singh's tank has leaked.

2180
02:01:20,815 --> 02:01:28,815
Not just the tank, even the big drum.

2181
02:01:31,292 --> 02:01:34,227
At least now let me go.

2182
02:01:46,307 --> 02:01:48,867
Jashn..
- Sahe], I am not here to interfere.

2183
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:54,780
I am here just to say that my friend
is very nice, honest and decent.

2184
02:01:55,149 --> 02:01:56,241
He was also good in studies.

2185
02:01:56,784 --> 02:01:58,878
Sooner or later he will
get a very good job.

2186
02:01:59,353 --> 02:02:01,344
You won't be able to find a better guy.

2187
02:02:01,555 --> 02:02:04,820
He loves you a lot as well.
- Can't he say all that?

2188
02:02:04,892 --> 02:02:06,792
That's why I have force invited myself.

2189
02:02:07,261 --> 02:02:09,787
If he could then what
would've been the problem?

2190
02:02:10,765 --> 02:02:12,665
Okay, I'll make a move now.

2191
02:02:13,634 --> 02:02:14,726
Deep.

2192
02:02:15,436 --> 02:02:18,428
Sorry, I lied to you.

2193
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,001
That I don't want to go to Canada

2194
02:02:22,376 --> 02:02:23,172
I know.

2195
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:26,243
I am not that that as
much as you think I am.

2196
02:02:26,614 --> 02:02:28,673
I cameto know during
Vinnie's engagement.

2197
02:02:28,816 --> 02:02:30,784
"That I am dialling the wrong number.

2198
02:02:31,785 --> 02:02:34,811
Fine. All the best I'll make a move.

2199
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:45,795
'If I wouldn't have helped him today.'

2200
02:02:45,966 --> 02:02:48,958
...he would've never expressed
his feeling to any girl.'

2201
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:52,996
'It's okaywith me. if I didn't
get her I'll get someone else.'

2202
02:02:54,908 --> 02:02:58,845
'Come on, Deep. Let's find
a cure for the heart ache.'

2203
02:03:03,917 --> 02:03:05,851
Couldn't you say all this?

2204
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:12,917
I could, but I had told you once
I move forward, I can't back off.

2205
02:03:13,928 --> 02:03:16,989
Now if your dad doesn't agree,
you shouldn't back off either.

2206
02:03:17,832 --> 02:03:20,961
That's what I wanted to see, how
good you are at keeping promises.

2207
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:25,770
This is the first time
I realised what love is.

2208
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:28,932
Now we will face whatever comes our way.

2209
02:04:05,846 --> 02:04:06,870
"Listen, my beloved."

2210
02:04:06,948 --> 02:04:07,938
"Yes, my love'? "

2211
02:04:08,015 --> 02:04:10,961
"Let's go.
- Where to"

2212
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:13,886
"A place different than all."

2213
02:04:13,954 --> 02:04:16,821
"Where there's just you and me."

2214
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:19,860
"There shouldn't be anyone to spot us."

2215
02:04:22,896 --> 02:04:25,831
"Far away from this world."

2216
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:28,869
"Far away from this world."

2217
02:04:28,936 --> 02:04:31,962
"Let's make a different
world for ourselves."

2218
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:36,987
"You and me."

2219
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:39,990
"You and me."

2220
02:04:40,014 --> 02:04:42,005
"You and me."

2221
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:45,876
"You and me."

2222
02:04:47,922 --> 02:04:50,983
"My heart races."

2223
02:04:51,792 --> 02:04:54,784
"But it fears sometimes as well."

2224
02:04:56,931 --> 02:04:59,957
"My heart races."

2225
02:05:00,033 --> 02:05:02,979
"But it fears sometimes as well."

2226
02:05:03,003 --> 02:05:05,938
"That we might get separated."

2227
02:05:06,006 --> 02:05:07,804
"You and me."

2228
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:08,865
"You and me."

2229
02:05:08,943 --> 02:05:10,809
"You and me."

2230
02:05:10,878 --> 02:05:11,902
"You and me."

2231
02:05:11,979 --> 02:05:14,004
"You and me."

2232
02:05:14,815 --> 02:05:17,841
"Yes, you and me."

2233
02:05:46,847 --> 02:05:52,752
"One cannot attain
love fearing the world."

2234
02:05:52,853 --> 02:05:58,758
"Don't worry. Place your head
on my chest and go to sleep."

2235
02:05:58,826 --> 02:06:03,889
"Don't worry. Place your head
on my chest and go to sleep."

2236
02:06:03,965 --> 02:06:06,798
"My love.
- Yes, dear?"

2237
02:06:06,867 --> 02:06:09,802
"Listen to me, my love.
- What is it, dear?"

2238
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:12,840
"This world is evil.

2239
02:06:12,907 --> 02:06:15,808
"This world is evil.

2240
02:06:15,876 --> 02:06:18,811
"Let's save our love from it.

2241
02:06:21,048 --> 02:06:22,880
"You and me."

2242
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:23,940
"You and me."

2243
02:06:24,018 --> 02:06:25,862
"You and me."

2244
02:06:25,886 --> 02:06:26,964
"You and me."

2245
02:06:26,988 --> 02:06:29,787
"You and me."

2246
02:06:29,857 --> 02:06:33,816
"Yes, you and me."

2247
02:07:01,889 --> 02:07:07,794
"My love, I am your
heartbeat, you are my heart."

2248
02:07:07,862 --> 02:07:13,801
"My love, I have
dedicated my life to you."

2249
02:07:13,868 --> 02:07:18,829
"My love, I have
dedicated my life to you."

2250
02:07:18,906 --> 02:07:20,772
"Don't fear, my dear."

2251
02:07:20,841 --> 02:07:21,865
"Don't break my heart."

2252
02:07:21,942 --> 02:07:23,000
"Hold my heart, my dear."

2253
02:07:23,844 --> 02:07:24,868
"Don't ever shy away."

2254
02:07:24,945 --> 02:07:27,778
"My dear, you love me?"

2255
02:07:27,848 --> 02:07:30,794
"My heart now belongs to my beloved."

2256
02:07:30,818 --> 02:07:33,844
"My life has become musical."

2257
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:39,756
"Let's add fragrance to flowers."

2258
02:07:39,827 --> 02:07:41,955
"Let's add fragrance to flowers."

2259
02:07:42,029 --> 02:07:45,829
"Come let's sing love songs."

2260
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:49,834
"You and me."

02:07:49,904 --> 02:07:50,894
"You and me."

2262
02:07:50,971 --> 02:07:52,803
"You and me."

2263
02:07:52,873 --> 02:07:53,897
"You and me."

2264
02:07:53,974 --> 02:07:55,999
"You and me."

2265
02:07:56,810 --> 02:07:58,972
"Yes, you and me."

2266
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:01,992
"Yes, you and me."

2267
02:08:02,016 --> 02:08:05,782
"Yes, you and me."

2268
02:08:06,954 --> 02:08:08,786
That's great.

2269
02:08:08,856 --> 02:08:12,815
What you did is amazing.
- Thank you, sir.

2270
02:08:13,027 --> 02:08:16,827

Turn around.

2274
02:08:24,939 --> 02:08:26,771
Why are you staring at me?

2275
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:27,974

Anna!

2294
02:09:33,007 --> 02:09:34,998
Viiay made Uiagar confess everything.

2295
02:09:35,943 --> 02:09:37,934
Now no one can save that bastard.

2296
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:41,814
I'm.. I'm so happy-.

Anna, well, I wanted to say"

Tell me. Why are you hesitating?

2307
02:10:20,955 --> 02:10:23,925
I wanted to say that
we are getting late.

2308
02:10:24,825 --> 02:10:26,919
We should go meet Tarsem. Let's go.

2309
02:10:26,994 --> 02:10:28,928
Take me along.

2310
02:10:32,032 --> 02:10:35,866
Why are you standing?
Please have a seat.

2311
02:10:36,837 --> 02:10:39,807
No, madam. We cannot sit today.

2312
02:10:41,008 --> 02:10:44,945
Why? What is it? Why
are you in such a hurry?

2313
02:10:49,517 --> 02:10:51,451
Why are you looking at each other?

2314
02:10:52,386 --> 02:10:53,478
Tell me, what is it?

2315
02:10:54,889 --> 02:10:59,918
What should we say,
ma'am? We are speechless.

2316
02:11:00,494 --> 02:11:02,462
Look, please, I am getting worried.

2317
02:11:02,763 --> 02:11:04,697
I will know about it
only when you tell me.

2318
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:08,599
Look, Hoopinder, I'm really sorry.

2319
02:11:08,769 --> 02:11:13,730
I am very sorry to
break this news to you.

2320
02:11:14,241 --> 02:11:17,267
Tell me, what is it? ls Tarsem alright?

2321
02:11:18,579 --> 02:11:20,673
Tarsem is alright.
What will happen to him?

2322
02:11:21,482 --> 02:11:25,282
Actually, ma'am , the other
day we had come to you".

2323
02:11:25,753 --> 02:11:27,797
...to tell you that someone
had betrayed Anna's sister..

2324
02:11:27,821 --> 02:11:32,452
...and came back to India
- Yes,
 know.

2325
02:11:33,294 --> 02:11:35,285
We have confirmed the
identity of that person.

2326
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:39,322
Now we need to decide his fate.

2327
02:11:40,468 --> 02:11:44,302
Fine, but what can I do in 'that?

2328
02:11:45,606 --> 02:11:48,507
Now whatever can be done can
only be done by you, ma'am.

2329
02:11:49,677 --> 02:11:55,582
Because.. I'm sorry to say
that person is none other than..

2330
02:11:57,485 --> 02:11:58,509
Tarsem .

2331
02:12:07,428 --> 02:12:08,589
Ma'am.

2332
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:18,862
Madam, when you had gone
to UK for your education"

2333
02:12:19,841 --> 02:12:23,971
"behind your back Tarsem has
gone to Canada on a fake passport.

2334
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:27,812
He went there and got
married to Anna's sister.

2335
02:12:27,882 --> 02:12:31,944
And when he came to know that
his enemies in India are dead"

2336
02:12:32,987 --> 02:12:39,893
...Tarsem deceived her, took all
her money and came back to India

2337
02:12:50,905 --> 02:12:51,929
Madam ..

2338
02:12:53,841 --> 02:12:57,800
Is your decision still the same?

2339
02:13:02,049 --> 02:13:03,983
My decision..

2340
02:13:08,889 --> 02:13:09,947
Is still the same.

2341
02:13:14,028 --> 02:13:16,793
But where is Tarsem?

2342
02:13:16,964 --> 02:13:20,923
What? Did you hear it properly?

2343
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:26,837
Broth er..

2344
02:13:28,042 --> 02:13:29,874
Did you make sure of it?

2345
02:13:31,879 --> 02:13:34,871
Hang up now. Another
problem has cropped up.

2346
02:13:34,982 --> 02:13:36,882
What happened, brother? ls Uiagar dead?

2347
02:13:36,951 --> 02:13:38,851
Such people don't die quickly.

2348
02:13:38,919 --> 02:13:41,865
Really?
- What are you doing here? Hun.

2349
02:13:41,889 --> 02:13:42,856
Wiay has been reinstated.

2350
02:13:42,923 --> 02:13:44,982
He will be here any moment.
- And you, brother?

2351
02:13:46,861 --> 02:13:49,922
What brother? Whose brother?
- Don't do that, brother.

2352
02:13:49,997 --> 02:13:52,796
I will die alone in
prison. Come with me.

2353
02:13:52,867 --> 02:13:53,977
I will take you with me. Nothing doing.

2354
02:13:54,001 --> 02:13:55,992
Hun away. I have political immunity.

2355
02:13:56,937 --> 02:13:57,961
Nothing will happen to me.

2356
02:13:58,973 --> 02:14:00,907
Brother, what you did was not right.

2357
02:14:01,809 --> 02:14:03,987
You have ruined me.

2358
02:14:04,011 --> 02:14:07,003
I will pay back for this.
I will take your name.

2359
02:14:08,015 --> 02:14:10,794
Those who take my name die. Go away.

2360
02:14:10,818 --> 02:14:11,944
What you did was not right, brother.

2361
02:14:19,994 --> 02:14:23,760
Hoopi. Hoopi.

2362
02:14:23,831 --> 02:14:25,925
Where are you? Hoopi.

2363
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,800
Hoopi, pack a few things
quickly. We have to leave.

2364
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:31,964
Hurry up.
- Why? Where are we going?

2365
02:14:32,039 --> 02:14:34,940
You women will never stop questioning.

2366
02:14:35,009 --> 02:14:36,977
I'll tell you that later.
Take Pinky and hurry up.

2367
02:14:37,044 --> 02:14:39,843
We don't have much time.
Be back in a minute.

2368
02:14:39,914 --> 02:14:43,851
Neither will I go anywhere,
not will I let you go anywhere.

2369
02:14:44,885 --> 02:14:46,876
This is no time to ioke. It's a real
pistol, you will shoot it accidentally.

2370
02:14:46,954 --> 02:14:47,978
Give it to me.

2371
02:14:51,926 --> 02:14:52,950
No.

2372
02:14:53,894 --> 02:14:58,889
No, Hoopinder. I forgive him
for your and Pinky's sake.

2373
02:14:59,834 --> 02:15:01,859
But I won't forgive him.

2374
02:15:02,036 --> 02:15:05,973
He has deceived not one but two women.

2375
02:15:06,039 --> 02:15:13,969
Look, Hoopi, for God's sake,
don't take Pinky away from me.

2376
02:15:14,916 --> 02:15:16,782
I will tell you about these foreigners.

2377
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:20,878
They are characterless. They
get married a number offimes.

2378
02:15:20,955 --> 02:15:24,823
Shut up. Their character
is better than yours.

2379
02:15:24,959 --> 02:15:26,893
She is still forgiving you.

2380
02:15:27,828 --> 02:15:31,958
But now, I won't let even your
shadow fall on my daughter.

2381
02:15:32,033 --> 02:15:34,764
I'll tell you tomorrow.

2382
02:15:38,972 --> 02:15:40,906
Your game is over, Tarsem Singh.

2383
02:15:40,975 --> 02:15:44,878
Come with me.
- Hoopi. Hoopi, look.

2384
02:15:45,012 --> 02:15:46,946
Nothing has happened.

2385
02:15:47,014 --> 02:15:48,846
We will make sure it does soon.

2386
02:16:06,967 --> 02:16:11,905
Okay, he too is done
for'? Hello, brother.

2387
02:16:12,806 --> 02:16:13,967
Do you recognise me now?

2388
02:16:14,908 --> 02:16:16,876
No, no, no. Why are you so angry?

2389
02:16:16,944 --> 02:16:19,936
It's so hot, and I've heard
there's no air conditioner in iail.

2390
02:16:20,014 --> 02:16:22,005
Stop your nonsense, all this
has happened because of you.

2391
02:16:22,916 --> 02:16:24,816
Why are you getting so angry?

2392
02:16:24,885 --> 02:16:26,979
Save some of your
conversation for prison.

2393
02:16:27,788 --> 02:16:29,779
You can share your
joys and sorrows there.

2394
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:31,824
Get him in.

2395
02:16:32,927 --> 02:16:33,985
<i>Come.</i>

2396
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:47,865
You stayed in someone's
house for a month.

2397
02:16:48,009 --> 02:16:49,875
Didn't you feel any shame?

2398
02:16:50,811 --> 02:16:52,006
Now you have brought
this useless guy here.

2399
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:55,915
His father lived off
his father-in-law.

2400
02:16:56,016 --> 02:16:57,984
And now he is here to do the same.

2401
02:16:58,785 --> 02:17:01,965
Stop it. He is educated
and our girl likes him.

2402
02:17:01,989 --> 02:17:03,957
Don't interfere.

2403
02:17:04,992 --> 02:17:06,983
Flies always gather over sweets.

2404
02:17:08,029 --> 02:17:10,828
He went after her because
she has come from Canada

2405
02:17:10,965 --> 02:17:14,833
Uncle, you can say you want
to me, but not my father.

2406
02:17:14,902 --> 02:17:16,893
Why? Am I wrong?

2407
02:17:18,906 --> 02:17:19,964
A brother shouldn't stay
in his sister's house.

2408
02:17:20,041 --> 02:17:21,941
And a son-in-law shouldn't
stay at his wife's house.

2409
02:17:22,910 --> 02:17:26,813
A smart person always checks the
breed of the dog before taking it in.

2410
02:17:26,914 --> 02:17:28,882
And you?
- Uncle, please.

2411
02:17:30,884 --> 02:17:32,978
No matter how he is,
he is still my father.

2412
02:17:34,788 --> 02:17:35,949
You cannot say such things about him.

2413
02:17:36,890 --> 02:17:38,824
You are Sahe]'s father otherwise"
- What otherwise?

2414
02:17:38,893 --> 02:17:39,883
Yes?

2415
02:17:39,994 --> 02:17:41,758
What will you do?

2416
02:17:41,962 --> 02:17:45,762
Did you hear that, girl? He
would've raised his hand on me.

2417
02:17:46,968 --> 02:17:49,994
Think over it. You can
go with him if you want.

2418
02:17:51,005 --> 02:17:53,770
But then, never come back to this house.

2419
02:17:53,941 --> 02:17:55,773
Papa, please.

2420
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:57,810
Papa, at least listen to me.

2421
02:18:02,850 --> 02:18:06,787
Sahe], I had told you, I never back out.

2422
02:18:07,021 --> 02:18:08,853
I won't back out now either.

2423
02:18:09,823 --> 02:18:10,847
Come, lefs go.

2424
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:28,008
Sahei, I'm talking to you.

2425
02:18:32,012 --> 02:18:33,878
Sahe].

2426
02:18:55,703 --> 02:18:58,673
I don't know how to thank all of you.

2427
02:18:58,739 --> 02:19:00,639
I have no words.

2428
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:04,735
All of you are very nice.

2429
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:10,680
I'll miss everyone a lot.

2430
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:18,691
Sahei, why are you so quiet?

2431
02:19:20,728 --> 02:19:23,595
Her father threw Jashn out of his house.

2432
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:27,598
Why didn't you call and inform me?

2433
02:19:28,702 --> 02:19:32,832
Aunt, Jashn had asked
me to come with him.

2434
02:19:33,674 --> 02:19:36,769
But I don't know whyl couldn't move.

2435
02:19:39,813 --> 02:19:41,679
Aunt
- Yes?

2436
02:19:41,883 --> 02:19:45,751
'Where is Kulcu'?
- Kulcu'?

2437
02:19:46,854 --> 02:19:51,792
He left early in the morning.
His phone too is switched off.

2438
02:19:53,861 --> 02:19:58,594
Perhaps, he couldn't
see both of you leave.

2439
02:20:01,702 --> 02:20:04,637
I wanted to give Kuku special thanks.

2440
02:20:04,872 --> 02:20:07,842
Nothing would've been
possible without his help.

2441
02:20:09,877 --> 02:20:11,675
Anna.

2442
02:20:13,847 --> 02:20:15,747
Kuku has given this for you.

2443
02:20:16,884 --> 02:20:23,620
And he has asked you to open this
packet only after you reach Canada

2444
02:20:31,665 --> 02:20:34,794
Tell Kuku that I'll miss him a lot.

2445
02:21:43,804 --> 02:21:49,800
'God, why does Kuku get his
heart broken time and again?'

2446
02:21:53,714 --> 02:22:01,714
"I've kept my feelings
hidden in my heart."

2447
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:10,790
"Neither did you ask,
nor did I tell you."

2448
02:22:13,667 --> 02:22:21,667
"Neither did you ask,
nor did I tell you."

2449
02:22:30,717 --> 02:22:33,652
"
 thought of you today."

2450
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:36,655
"
 thought of you every moment."

2451
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:42,630
"
 thought of you today."

2452
02:22:42,696 --> 02:22:44,824
"
 thought of you every moment."

2453
02:22:45,666 --> 02:22:50,797
"
 couldn't forget
my estranged beloved."

2454
02:22:50,871 --> 02:22:56,742
"
 couldn't forget
my estranged beloved."

2455
02:22:56,810 --> 02:23:02,749
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2456
02:23:02,816 --> 02:23:07,777
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2457
02:23:07,854 --> 02:23:14,760
Tell me, we always do our best
to make our children happy.

2458
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:19,733
But when we get a chance to
give them the biggest joy".

2459
02:23:20,667 --> 02:23:23,637
...of their life, we back off. Why?

2460
02:23:28,842 --> 02:23:36,647
"God knows, you are
somehow related to me."

2461
02:23:38,786 --> 02:23:46,694
"God knows, you are
somehow related to me."

2462
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:52,631
"Even though you are
miles away from me."

2463
02:23:52,699 --> 02:23:58,604
"Even though you are
miles away from me."

2464
02:23:58,672 --> 02:24:03,803
"You siayin my heart,
my estranged beloved."

2465
02:24:03,877 --> 02:24:09,816
"You siayin my heart,
my estranged beloved."

2466
02:24:09,883 --> 02:24:15,652
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2467
02:24:15,722 --> 02:24:21,752
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2468
02:24:26,867 --> 02:24:30,667
'I apologise for not meeting
you when you were leaving.'

2469
02:24:30,737 --> 02:24:34,833
'The truth is, I cannot see you leave.'

2470
02:24:36,844 --> 02:24:41,680
'I tried telling you a number
of times, but I couldn't.'

2471
02:24:42,649 --> 02:24:44,674
'Anna, I love you.'

2472
02:24:45,652 --> 02:24:51,682
"Your presence used to please my soul.

2473
02:24:56,797 --> 02:25:02,736
"Your presence used to please my soul.

2474
02:25:02,803 --> 02:25:08,674
"VWthout you, my soul wanders aimless."

2475
02:25:08,742 --> 02:25:14,647
"VWthout you, my soul wanders aimless."

2476
02:25:14,715 --> 02:25:20,620
"Without you, the spring
seems meaningless, my love."

2477
02:25:20,687 --> 02:25:25,818
"Without you, the spring
seems meaningless, my love."

2478
02:25:26,626 --> 02:25:31,655
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2479
02:25:31,732 --> 02:25:37,762
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2480
02:25:37,838 --> 02:25:40,773
"
 thought of you today."

2481
02:25:40,841 --> 02:25:43,776
"
 thought of you every moment."

2482
02:25:43,844 --> 02:25:49,726
"
 couldn't forget
my estranged beloved."

2483
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:55,621
"
 couldn't forget
my estranged beloved."

2484
02:25:55,689 --> 02:26:00,718
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2485
02:26:01,662 --> 02:26:08,830
"Bless you, my estranged beloved."

2486
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:15,810
"Never fall in love with a foreigner."

2487
02:26:17,644 --> 02:26:19,806
"No matter how precious that person is."

2488
02:26:22,783 --> 02:26:25,718
"That person is only
good for one thing."

2489
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:30,654
"Miss him and cry."

2490
02:26:33,827 --> 02:26:36,626
You cannot forget some people.

2491
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:40,664
Come, let's at least forget our sorrows.

2492
02:27:00,854 --> 02:27:03,721
You didn't tell me. You
wrote it in a letter?

2493
02:27:05,726 --> 02:27:06,784
Will do.

2494
02:27:10,798 --> 02:27:11,822
I love you.

2495
02:27:18,739 --> 02:27:20,673
Anna.

2496
02:27:21,742 --> 02:27:23,642
I love you.

2497
02:27:28,849 --> 02:27:32,581
You thought I betrayed you.

2498
02:27:33,687 --> 02:27:35,678
I didn't come with you the other day.

2499
02:27:35,756 --> 02:27:36,780
No, Sahei.

2500
02:27:36,857 --> 02:27:38,791
I'm really sorry.

2501
02:27:39,693 --> 02:27:40,785
I'm so sorry.

2502
02:27:40,861 --> 02:27:43,626
Your dad was absolutely right.

2503
02:27:44,798 --> 02:27:48,632
Let me stand on my feet then
I'll surely cometo take you.

2504
02:27:48,803 --> 02:27:52,637
I'll wait for you.
- What?

2505
02:28:03,751 --> 02:28:06,812
Jagtar, your aunt from Canada is here?
- Yes.

2506
02:28:07,654 --> 02:28:08,815
She came back four days ago.
- Really'?

2507
02:28:09,657 --> 02:28:10,818
Did her daughter come with her?

2508
02:28:11,658 --> 02:28:13,649
Her daughter had to come with her.

2509
02:28:13,727 --> 02:28:16,822
Strange, aunt came four days ago
and you didn't even inform me.

2510
02:28:17,665 --> 02:28:20,691
I'll go and meet her
first - We.. - Me too..

2511
02:28:20,768 --> 02:28:22,634
You scoundrel.

2512
02:28:22,703 --> 02:28:26,650
What? I am planning to
make you my brother-in-law.

2513
02:28:26,674 --> 02:28:27,732
You..

2514
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:29,919
"Sister-in-law, with my
musical instruments "

2515
02:28:29,943 --> 02:28:32,844
"Sister-in-law, with my
musical instruments "

2516
02:28:33,847 --> 02:28:36,817
"Sister-in-law,
I was rehearsing."

2517
02:28:37,818 --> 02:28:40,583
"Sister-in-law, with my
musical instruments "

2518
02:28:40,654 --> 02:28:42,622
"Sister-in-law,
I was rehearsing."

2519
02:28:42,689 --> 02:28:44,623
'Someone came from behind.."

2520
02:28:44,692 --> 02:28:48,720
'Someone came from behind
and ruined everything."

2521
02:28:49,830 --> 02:28:53,789
"Sister-in-law, someone hit
me on my back with a rod."

2522
02:28:53,867 --> 02:28:57,633
"Sister-in-law, someone hit
me on my back with a rod."

2523
02:28:57,704 --> 02:28:59,672
"Sister-in-law, someone
hit me with a rod."

2524
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:02,675
"Sister-in-law, someone
hit me with a rod."

2525
02:29:17,791 --> 02:29:19,782
"He was very bad."

2526
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:22,761
"He ruined everything in no time."

2527
02:29:22,829 --> 02:29:27,733
"He tore the bellows of my harmonium."

2528
02:29:27,801 --> 02:29:29,792
"He was very bad."

2529
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:32,737
"He ruined everything in no time."

2530
02:29:32,806 --> 02:29:37,821
"He tore the bellows of my harmonium."

2531
02:29:37,845 --> 02:29:39,813
"He tore it apart."

2532
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:41,746
"He tore it apart."

2533
02:29:41,815 --> 02:29:44,716
"He dismantled it.

2534
02:29:45,753 --> 02:29:49,781
"Sister-in-law, someone hit
me on my back with a rod."

2535
02:29:49,857 --> 02:29:53,589
"Sister-in-law, someone hit
me on my back with a rod."

2536
