1
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:15,120
Smoking and drinking
are injurious to health.

2
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,269
Smoking and drinking
are injurious to health.

3
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,065
My dear citizens!

4
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:33,918
Dear audience!

5
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,849
Come and see the talkies.

6
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:39,025
Guntur Talkies!

7
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:41,944
My dear, take the hand off your face.

8
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:45,188
Madam, Didn't we ask
you not to bring small kids?

9
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:48,079
You won't listen. See, my brother.

10
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,917
Stop your nonsense and take your seat.

11
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,971
The movie is about to start.

12
00:01:53,051 --> 00:02:02,903
Guntur Talkies!

13
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:06,943
420!

14
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,959
420!

15
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,796
420!

16
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,201
420!

17
00:02:56,444 --> 00:03:00,013
Father, wash me!

18
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:03,444
Father, wash me!

19
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,579
Father, I'm asking you to wash.

20
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:07,147
Crap!

21
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:12,310
Father, wash me! Father, wash me!

22
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,836
Father, it will become dry. Wash quickly.

23
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:17,013
He says that it will become dry.

24
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:19,756
What is your problem in washing it?

25
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,878
Why should I wash it?

26
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:25,364
You are 4 years old
but can't wash yourself.

27
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,242
Cattle are better than you.

28
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,054
Today you will go to school
only if you wash yourself.

29
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,067
Otherwise stand there like that.

30
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,647
Shut up, you fool.

31
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:35,810
Is this how you talk to children?

32
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:37,620
Go and wash him.

33
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,350
What are you doing?

34
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,458
Why don't you wash him?
- I don't want granny.

35
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,972
Oil will stick to me.
I want you only to wash.

36
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:46,944
You little rascal!

37
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,932
Just like your father
used to wash for you..

38
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,944
..it seems you have to do a similar job.

39
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,106
Son and grandson..

40
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,836
..all of them have
come together to pester me.

41
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:00,701
I should have my
daughter-in-law serving me now.

42
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,106
In this ripe old age..

43
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:06,783
But instead god gave me this
damned fate of washing these kids!

44
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:10,161
Father, it is getting dry. Please wash.

45
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,906
Hey, if you shout, I will slap your back.

46
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:16,136
Hey, Giri! Where are you?

47
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,798
I'm at my home, sir.

48
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:20,243
Who will open the shop,
if you are at home?

49
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm starting off immediately.

50
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:25,730
If you don't open the shop in 15 min,
your back will be slapped.

51
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,703
Okay, sir.

52
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:30,636
Father, wash me!

53
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,852
First wash him. He's pestering a lot.

54
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:35,406
Father, wash it. We have to go to school.

55
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:07,189
It's now.. it's you!

56
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,113
It's great!

57
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,689
Hari, are you fine?

58
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,608
I'll come early in the evening.
We'll go to a movie.

59
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,879
Ok, dear.

60
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,919
Don't fight.

61
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,135
Give it one after another.

62
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:17,906
What is the time?

63
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,500
It's 10:30.
- Crap!

64
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:22,832
Hey, Pay the money and go.
- All ladies come here.

65
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:26,420
You, you and you.. Please come.

66
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,932
My boy..
- What is it?

67
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,757
Give me some medicine.

68
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:32,258
All of these are medicines.

69
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,879
What medicine do you want?
- I have knee pain..

70
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,838
..Headache and burning in the feet.

71
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:39,567
You don't need so many medicines.

72
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:42,933
I'll give you just one and all
your pain will be gone by morning. - Ok.

73
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,149
Take this home..

74
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:49,608
..Powder it, mix well with rice and eat.

75
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,379
By morning all your pain will be gone.

76
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:54,393
My dear boy.. god bless you!
- Hey!

77
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,446
If you eat that, you will be gone!

78
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,149
Will you kill her?

79
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,757
What else to do?
- Take these medicines and give Rs. 20.

80
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:05,351
Keep going. Next!

81
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,081
I want that..
- What?

82
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:11,067
I want that..
- I understood.

83
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:16,785
Hello..
- Hello, 40k.

84
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:19,487
40k, give Rs.100.
- Hello! - Aunty, what do you want?

85
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:27,932
You finish talking? Give me Rs. 100.

86
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:29,730
Take this.

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,986
I will relieve myself.
Take care of customers.

88
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,959
But you just came.

89
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:35,810
I may have timings.

90
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,540
But that doesn't have.
I will relieve myself and come.

91
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,243
He always talks nonsense.

92
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:45,175
When did you open the shop?

93
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,148
At 10.30.
- When should you open it?

94
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:48,689
At 9.30.

95
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,378
Both of you have become arrogant.

96
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,163
Where is the great man?

97
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,283
Is he in a mood to work today are not?

98
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:57,581
He came, sir.

99
00:07:57,661 --> 00:07:59,500
He came?
- Yes. - Where is he?

100
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,446
Where is he?

101
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:04,716
Give me change, madam.

102
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:10,555
What is this? A medical shop
or some bathroom in your house?

103
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:12,217
What is this dust?

104
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:13,960
I too say the same, sir.

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,960
What is this?
Shouldn't we clean our counters?

106
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,932
I will slap you if you
don't come on time tomorrow.

107
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,608
Go and attend to work.

108
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,257
The fool!

109
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,472
Rascal!

110
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:32,904
Hey, Get me one masala
dosa and only one tea. - Ok, sir.

111
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:37,094
Go!
- Just one tea!

112
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,202
What a problem with this man!

113
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,501
Why did you come?

114
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,434
Why did you come?

115
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,326
Sister asked to bring medicine.

116
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,961
What problem does your sister have?
- Why don't you ask?

117
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,230
You know her well.
- I do.

118
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,812
Hey!

119
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,758
Tell her that I will
bring medicine at night.

120
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,474
Go now.

121
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:27,596
Hey!

122
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,514
What is your name?

123
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:33,690
I ask you.

124
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,284
Suvarna..

125
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,879
'O Suvarna!'
- You may go.

126
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,581
'Suvarna! Come, Suvarna!'
- You may go.

127
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,730
'Suvarna!'

128
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:51,379
'Come, Suvarna.'

129
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,082
'Suvarna!'

130
00:09:58,326 --> 00:09:59,934
Give it here.

131
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,935
Why do you look like that?
Where's my dosa?

132
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:10,353
Masala dosa, isn't it sir?
- You! - Also only one tea!

133
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:13,583
You always clamour for tea.

134
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,028
You may go. - Sir, you said
you would give salary today.

135
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,365
You remember this well.

136
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,135
2.. 3.. 4.. 5.

137
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:34,717
Take this.

138
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:36,014
But my salary is 6000.

139
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,326
You must open my shop
at 9 in the morning.

140
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:41,824
Every time that you don't open
the shop on time, I will cut 100.

141
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:44,649
First learn to open the shop on time.

142
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:47,514
Otherwise, you will lose it all.

143
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:50,054
Sir, Will you give my salary too?

144
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:59,149
Here.. What are you counting?

145
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:01,986
Thinking why I didn't
cut from your 4000? - No.

146
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:05,716
If I cut from that amount,
your heart will stop and you'll die.

147
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:07,879
If you don't come on time from tomorrow..

148
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,540
We got it.

149
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:14,067
The miser!

150
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:18,188
How can I manage a fee cuts
Rs. 1000 from the paltry 6000 he gives me?

151
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,744
That's true.

152
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:21,514
You will also have many expenses.

153
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:23,389
And he doesn't give that
on the first of the month either.

154
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:27,446
Today is the 15th, bro.
- That's what I'm saying.

155
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:29,960
Why don't you open the shop on time?

156
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,608
What work do you have
early in the morning?

157
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,391
You would know if you had kids.

158
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:38,026
You must wash and bathe
them and send them to school.

159
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,932
You are a carefree person.

160
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:43,553
No, bro. The 4000 he
gives me falls too short.

161
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:46,121
How longer do we continue like this?

162
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,932
I am struggling here since two years.

163
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:51,109
It is only two years for you.

164
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:54,581
I'm stuck here since four years.
He doesn't give a raise or pay on time.

165
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:58,109
The wastrel! - How much
did he give you in the beginning?

166
00:11:58,188 --> 00:11:59,716
5000..

167
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,812
He gave you the same now also!
- That is my complaint.

168
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,163
Bro!
- Yes?

169
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:38,379
Give me Rs. 100.

170
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:43,689
For the 11 o'clock show?

171
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,676
No, please.
You always do this and never listen to me.

172
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,094
If you are done, give me Rs. 100.
- Here you go.

173
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,608
Madam!

174
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,298
I will relieve myself and return.

175
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:07,528
She stays alone and doesn't
seem to know anyone in the neighborhood.

176
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,069
I get some rotten smell.

177
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,893
It is the samber.
Must be from day before yesterday.

178
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,231
Brother, there.

179
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:39,447
It is time for the movie.

180
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,352
We have a lot of time.
- Doing this daily is a problem.

181
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,230
I can't stop myself.

182
00:13:58,489 --> 00:13:59,408
What a scene!

183
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,056
I didn't see this since my wife eloped.

184
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:09,081
Brother, why did your wife elope?

185
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:12,509
I don't know. - She must
have left a letter or something.

186
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,006
She didn't.

187
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:17,568
She didn't write a letter?

188
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:22,671
How he's enjoying!
Our lives are useless.

189
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:27,384
My life is good.
Don't group me with yourself.

190
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:28,908
Don't move.

191
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:31,504
Why do you want this at this age?

192
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,066
It is over!

193
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,817
Is it already over?

194
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:52,435
Here!

195
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:57,288
Mosquito item. Brother!
- What?

196
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,033
Fan.

197
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,633
We may be caught. Stash it carefully.

198
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:04,045
It should not be visible.

199
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,044
Don't take useless things and trouble me.

200
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:10,812
The fan, a bag..

201
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:16,174
Brother! - What is it?
- This..

202
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:18,370
That's okay. Take it.

203
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,733
I will take it.

204
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:22,932
An iron box.

205
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,365
Brother!
- What is it?

206
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,169
Something here..

207
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:34,629
...one.. two.. three...

208
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,743
It's a 5000/-
- She must have got salary today only.

209
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:40,349
Put it back where you took it from.

210
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:41,851
After that.

211
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:46,943
Hey, If we take everything
she will give a police complaint.

212
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:51,567
Keep the money there and take the mirror.

213
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:52,555
Ok.

214
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,996
I got it.

215
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:06,759
Let's go.

216
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:21,222
Guntur!

217
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:28,500
Talkies!

218
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,158
Talkies!

219
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,264
Catch us if you can!

220
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:38,924
420!

221
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:42,661
420!

222
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:46,907
420!

223
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:58,013
"Go in the night."

224
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,950
"Sneak into homes."

225
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,757
"Loot them."

226
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,842
"Pack all the items."

227
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,606
"This vegetable basket."

228
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:07,457
"That broom."

229
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:11,480
"Don't spare anything and take it all."

230
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:15,327
"If you are capable,
the entire city of Guntur is a treasure."

231
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:19,116
"Exchange for pennies
and fill your pocket."

232
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,982
"Keep a watch around
and finish your business."

233
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:26,339
"When you hear any bell, start running."

234
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,887
420!

235
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,614
420!

236
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:40,237
"Guntur Talkies!"

237
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:47,891
"Guntur Talkies!"

238
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,375
What is there in that?

239
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:32,189
There must be something in here.

240
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:33,347
The boxes..

241
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:36,851
Condom packets!

242
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,738
Don't take full boxes.
He might give a police complaint.

243
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:44,557
Don't be afraid, bro.

244
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:46,726
What will he complain about?

245
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,373
Would he say that he
lost condom packets? - Right.

246
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,889
You are very intelligent.

247
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,552
Manu.. Who is the girl in your house?

248
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:07,163
My auntie's daughter. My sister.

249
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,021
Why do you ask?
- Just like that.

250
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,703
I saw her the other day.

251
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,823
Don't think about her.
She's from Cuddapah.

252
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:22,220
If they come to know,
he will smash your head with a boulder.

253
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:25,992
What do I care? I just asked.

254
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:29,332
Sir, this toothpaste has salt.
Good to send to our family.

255
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:31,894
Why do you say our family?
Go and do your work.

256
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:35,560
Are there ten of them?

257
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,555
Why only nine?
There should be 10. Count properly.

258
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,355
3 and 3 and 3.. 9 sir.

259
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,884
Useless idiots!

260
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,538
They cheat even in packaging.

261
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,942
Hello!
- Take this.

262
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:51,851
"Change the sound of
pennies and collect notes."

263
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:55,581
"There is no one to stop you.
You are the king."

264
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:59,525
"Catch the sound and convey the signal."

265
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:03,319
"Make it your ring
tone and rule the roost."

266
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,211
"Change the sound of
pennies and collect notes."

267
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,060
"There is no one to stop you.
You are the king."

268
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:14,909
"Catch the sound and convey the signal."

269
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:18,747
"Make it your ring
tone and rule the roost."

270
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:22,541
"If you are capable,
the entire city of Guntur is a treasure."

271
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:26,358
"Exchange for pennies
and fill your pocket."

272
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:30,196
"Keep a watch around
and finish your business."

273
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:35,666
"When you hear any bell,
start running.. 420!"

274
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,314
I am going to Tirupati with my family.

275
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:40,692
I will return the day after tomorrow.
Take care of the shop.

276
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,757
If there is anything amiss in
the stock or the cash, you will be fired.

277
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:47,567
I am taking 5000 from the counter.

278
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,304
Make a note of it.
- Ok, sir.

279
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:51,428
Good riddance!

280
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,491
Hey, Giri!
- Sir?

281
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,508
I will call the shop exactly
at 9.30 tomorrow morning.

282
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:01,751
If you don't pick the phone,
your salaries for this month shall be cut.

283
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:07,364
Give medicine for cold.

284
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:08,845
You won't get that here.

285
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:10,974
Medicine for cold..
- Don't have it.

286
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,996
Why do you have a shop
without medicine for cold?

287
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:17,644
My shop is my wish.
Who are you to ask? Get lost!

288
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,326
Get lost!

289
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,785
Nonsense!

290
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:38,099
Is it done?
- Wake up!

291
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:41,278
Wake up and search.
Getting late.

292
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,073
Glass articles..

293
00:21:57,153 --> 00:21:59,948
There is something here.

294
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:12,250
How long will you take? Come soon.

295
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:14,390
Let's go. I forgot.

296
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,910
Hey, Give me the bag.
- I'm coming.

297
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:22,282
Go in and lock the door.

298
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:25,168
Let's go. See you.

299
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,591
I want water.
- Don't have it.

300
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,542
Give me some tea.
- No milk.

301
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:16,211
"Your charisma and your love."

302
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:18,848
Hello!

303
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,022
Yes..

304
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:24,439
House..

305
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:28,827
I am coming.

306
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:54,276
"His looks prick like needles."

307
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:57,693
"He gets drawn to beautiful girls."

308
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,931
"He searches all over the curves."

309
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,433
"He shows up from behind the curtains."

310
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:09,000
"The naughty boy doesn't stay quiet."

311
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,065
"He doesn't budge despite scolding."

312
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:16,980
"He doesn't stop his
nuisance even after shouting."

313
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,466
"Given small room,
he tries to take full advantage."

314
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:55,932
"O Suvarna! Suvarna!"

315
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,245
"Come, Suvarna"

316
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:03,673
"O Suvarna! Suvarna!"

317
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:06,115
"Come, Suvarna."

318
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:23,088
Wash him properly.

319
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:30,688
"He comes as soon as
there is opportunity."

320
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:34,558
"Even early in the morning he turns up."

321
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:38,504
"He has no limits and
crosses all boundaries."

322
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:42,062
"He troubles may always for a kiss."

323
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,759
"He doesn't stay put at one place."

324
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:49,618
"He doesn't stop even
after getting abused."

325
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:53,769
"He doesn't stop his
nuisance even after shouting."

326
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:58,310
"Though I object, sometimes I like it."

327
00:27:13,392 --> 00:27:17,250
"O Suvarna! Suvarna!"

328
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,531
"Come, Suvarna."

329
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:24,970
"O Suvarna! Suvarna!"

330
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:27,651
"Come, Suvarna."

331
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:32,677
"O Suvarna! Suvarna!"

332
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:35,037
"Come, Suvarna."

333
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,391
You bother..

334
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,787
I've got a useless son!

335
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:53,326
Who can I complain to?

336
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,185
We may find a wife
whose husband deserted her.

337
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,213
He's the first husband
whose wife left him.

338
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,835
The entire town mocks at us.

339
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:08,482
Hey, Do you hear this?
Your life is useless.

340
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:11,855
It is four years since she left.

341
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:14,579
How longer will you abuse
me about the same thing?

342
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,871
It would have been okay if she just left.

343
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:19,056
But she eloped!

344
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:22,181
And that too with Sundaram
who is good for nothing.

345
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,839
That idiotic woman
left one moron for another.

346
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,790
Roja, get me a dosa.

347
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,375
My dosa!

348
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:39,748
Roja, the dosa is burnt!

349
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:45,403
See this saree, how it is torn all over.

350
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:47,036
The blouse stitches are coming off.

351
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:50,009
The dosa is as good as my clothes.

352
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:53,327
Shut up and eat or get me new clothes.

353
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:57,997
Roja, You give burnt dosa to my son!

354
00:28:58,076 --> 00:29:00,019
He left hungry.

355
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:02,937
You eat to your fill always!
- Just shut up!

356
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:05,185
I'm wearing the same clothes for a year.

357
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:08,385
He cannot buy a blouse for his wife.
That burnt dosa suits him.

358
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,057
Sundaram of that cloth
store is better than your son.

359
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:13,489
Whenever he sees me,
he tells about new stock in the store.

360
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,525
He asks if I want a new saree or blouse.

361
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,007
Stop your nonsense!

362
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:31,380
Bro, You have to come urgently.

363
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,034
Come soon.
- What happened? - I lost the shop keys.

364
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,903
I have to open it before the owner comes.

365
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,514
Otherwise I am done for.
- I am coming.

366
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:41,748
Please come.
- I am coming. Wait a minute.

367
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:46,094
Hey, is it this one?
- Yes.

368
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:50,472
Hey, you will make me fall.
- The owner will come.

369
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:54,937
I opened it.

370
00:29:55,954 --> 00:29:57,337
You are great!

371
00:30:02,863 --> 00:30:04,269
This is the one to be opened?

372
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:12,182
Is it opened? Thanks.

373
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:15,836
You are saved.
- You are my God.

374
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:30,766
Hey!

375
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,938
Hey, You forgot your cycle.

376
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:39,631
Why did he get away with the box?

377
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:44,225
Oh.. they are thieves!

378
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,656
See how this saree is torn!

379
00:30:47,736 --> 00:30:50,425
Shut up and eat or buy me new clothes.

380
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:55,924
Hey, stop! Thief!

381
00:30:56,005 --> 00:30:57,492
Sir!

382
00:30:58,654 --> 00:31:01,167
Alas! I am innocent, sir.

383
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:03,303
I know that you are innocent.

384
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:07,775
He will catch them by tomorrow evening.
Tell me one thing.

385
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,370
What is it, sir?

386
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:11,762
How did that saree get into your hands?

387
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:14,884
It must have come by mistake.

388
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:19,412
Sign here and go home.

389
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:23,439
Sir, he thinks it's a joke.

390
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:25,317
It's true.

391
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:33,168
No one who hit my son did well in life,
scoundrels!

392
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:37,316
The bastards! How to got beaten, my son.

393
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:41,195
My daughter in law isn't even
concerned that her husband got beaten.

394
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:44,195
She ate to her fill and slept.

395
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,261
Nothing will stop!

396
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:53,099
If it stops, it won't go on.

397
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,896
O god, public.

398
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:01,586
Ladies also.

399
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:06,531
Roja Rani!
- Giridhar!

400
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:09,829
Roja Rani!
- Sundar!

401
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,112
Roja Rani!
- Sorry, Giridhar!

402
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:14,639
Our kids, Roja Rani.

403
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,721
Take good care of them.

404
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,869
They are very young.

405
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:26,113
What a life!

406
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:31,856
What's this?
- What?

407
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,977
You got burnt here.

408
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,463
Hey!

409
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:38,990
You got burnt there.

410
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,369
It is nothing.

411
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,707
Tell me what happened.

412
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,990
I just got injured, thats all.

413
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,612
How can you get injured there?

414
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,140
How is it like that?

415
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:52,937
I won't tell anyone, tell me.

416
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:56,476
It was a nightmare.
- What is it?

417
00:32:56,707 --> 00:33:00,180
Just like your wife left you..

418
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,827
..I too had to run away from a girl.

419
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,030
Hey, will you eat fruit ice?

420
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,205
Hey, will you eat instead?

421
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:16,909
They don't seem to care.

422
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:18,827
The items here are good.

423
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,327
There is much more.

424
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:24,732
The real items did
not come to the market yet.

425
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:26,651
What a wonder..

426
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:28,921
She smiled!

427
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,218
Yes, this seems to work out.

428
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,124
Let's make an attempt.

429
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,975
The real item seems to have come.

430
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:04,433
Hey!

431
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,583
Oh God!

432
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:10,245
Stop there, rascal!

433
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:18,581
Would you whistle at my sister?

434
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:24,879
Just nod, sister.
It is many days since I did a murder.

435
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,393
Please, madam. Sorry!

436
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:29,960
Madam!

437
00:34:41,432 --> 00:34:42,893
Are you new to the place?

438
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:48,230
Come!

439
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:04,824
Come!

440
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:12,067
Come!

441
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:28,959
Come!

442
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:40,958
Madam!

443
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,648
Sister, I brought it.

444
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:11,106
Please don't do it, madam.

445
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:13,864
No, madam. Please!

446
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:20,377
No, madam. Please!

447
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:24,202
Please don't do it, madam.

448
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,108
Worthless life!

449
00:36:55,188 --> 00:36:57,663
My father is pestering me
to go to the city and find a job.

450
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,177
Why is that?

451
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:01,338
The three of us planned
to start a video parlour.

452
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:03,068
How will it work if you go to the city?

453
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:05,027
Forget the video parlour.

454
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,676
Where can we get four lakhs right now?

455
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:10,243
That is true.

456
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:12,231
Our Hari is doing a good job.

457
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:14,123
He settled very well.

458
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,717
Drinks and food and the girl..

459
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:20,932
Why don't you to talk
with her and set up something?

460
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:24,771
Are you mad? She will tie up the
three of us and burn with a car battery.

461
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:27,704
What is the car battery thing?
- Nothing.

462
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,042
He's here!
- Come!

463
00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:35,824
"Here is my moment of joy."

464
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:41,581
"I will enjoy it every moment."

465
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:46,460
"Here is my moment of joy."

466
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,108
Madam!
- Yes?

467
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:50,554
Madam!
- Yes?

468
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:53,851
My uncle is asking me to go to Bombay.

469
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:55,730
What is there in Bombay?

470
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:59,649
He wants me to take up a job there.

471
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,514
Tell him you won't go.

472
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:03,878
I told him that.

473
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:07,824
I told him I won't go there
and set up a video parlour here.

474
00:38:08,177 --> 00:38:13,488
My uncle asked where would I
get four lakhs to start a video parlour.

475
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:15,690
That is also true, isn't it?

476
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,421
Where can I get four lakhs immediately?

477
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,042
I think it is better to go to Bombay.

478
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,757
Madam!

479
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,690
Listen!

480
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:30,893
No one can take you away from me.
- Madam!

481
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:33,527
Come tomorrow morning
and take the money.

482
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:37,932
Three lakh seventy thousand!

483
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:42,461
But madam, I asked for four lakhs.

484
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:45,001
Who will pay the interest?

485
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:47,136
Is it 30,000 every month?

486
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:50,163
By the first of every month. Sign on it.

487
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:54,204
What is this, madam?
- Our wish! Sign up!

488
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:57,190
Would you do this even with me?

489
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,554
There is no mixing relations
and business. - I will sign.

490
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:03,312
Sign up!
- Playing pranks!

491
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,338
It's done. Thank you, madam.

492
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,190
Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam.

493
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:14,893
Hey!

494
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:18,365
Madam?

495
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,083
Come!

496
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:32,528
The bus is coming.

497
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:35,650
Give me the bag quickly.

498
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,541
Give it fast!

499
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:39,447
Hold on!

500
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,556
You count everything even
after getting the seat you wanted.

501
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:45,974
Take it when you're about to get down.

502
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:48,380
13..14..15..

503
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,853
What?
- A seat.

504
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,759
Seat no 42 in that last row.

505
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,312
Go and sit there.

506
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:55,177
Do you think I'm a fool?

507
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:00,447
Why do you get angry?
Take this window seat no 15.

508
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,217
You get angry quickly.

509
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:04,920
Please take the seat, Sir.

510
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:09,083
Sir..

511
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:12,434
Don't forget to take
it while getting down.

512
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:14,719
The idiot!

513
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,583
Should I pay you interest
of 30,000 per month?

514
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:25,041
This is the price for using me.
It is squared up!

515
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,014
O God!

516
00:40:38,382 --> 00:40:39,472
Let me hide!

517
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:41,810
Madam!
- Quiet!

518
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:46,755
What happened?

519
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:49,865
Sorry!

520
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:53,568
You need not say anything.
You may use my hand.

521
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:00,175
You seem to be a very good man.

522
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:02,053
You look very beautiful.

523
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:07,257
You are very lucky..
You got the bus just in time.

524
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:15,769
Are you coming from a marriage?

525
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:20,026
Don't be afraid. I won't tell anyone.

526
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,552
Hello, brother.

527
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:31,972
Your leg is on my seat.
Will you remove it?

528
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:36,078
Hey, Is it your seat?
- Yes. - did you bring it from your home?

529
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:40,025
When a girl sits beside,
everyone becomes a hero.

530
00:42:40,242 --> 00:42:41,715
Sit quietly!
- Quiet!

531
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:06,362
Where is my bag?

532
00:43:11,782 --> 00:43:14,634
Hey, Where is my luggage?

533
00:43:14,713 --> 00:43:16,106
How would I know about it?

534
00:43:16,186 --> 00:43:19,214
You are responsible for your things.
you didn't read the board here?

535
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:23,188
Where is the girl sitting next to me?

536
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,525
She was going to Suryapet..
3 tickets. Got down long time back.

537
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:28,513
What three tickets? She was alone.

538
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:31,188
Girl was only one..
but she had two cousins behind.

539
00:43:31,405 --> 00:43:32,918
They are our regular customers.

540
00:43:33,418 --> 00:43:34,809
My 4 lakhs!

541
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:38,282
Sir, If you give me my money I will go.

542
00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:41,471
You ask me when I lost all my money.

543
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,567
Did I?
- Hey, bro!

544
00:43:44,485 --> 00:43:47,539
Which place is this? - It is Guntur.
Get down and wash yourself.

545
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:50,984
Bro!

546
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:54,768
Enjoy at my plight!

547
00:43:55,918 --> 00:43:57,336
Go away!

548
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,440
Bro!

549
00:44:15,146 --> 00:44:17,998
Go down and get some peanuts.

550
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,106
No peanuts.

551
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:25,295
Ok, get some liquor.
- Yes.

552
00:44:25,525 --> 00:44:29,255
Get some liquor.
- Yes, we need liquor.

553
00:44:29,498 --> 00:44:32,011
Otherwise it won't do.

554
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:38,931
Don't go away.

555
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:32,166
Did you bring liquor?

556
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,751
No.
- You didn't?

557
00:46:36,188 --> 00:46:38,199
Let's go together and buy.

558
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:40,998
I won't come.

559
00:46:42,371 --> 00:46:44,804
Have these snacks.

560
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,322
Here..

561
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,117
Alas!

562
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:04,967
My son, What did you
do roaming around the town?

563
00:47:05,047 --> 00:47:07,949
You don't even think that,
an old woman is at home..

564
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,123
..She has knee pain and
you must get her medicine.

565
00:47:10,362 --> 00:47:12,481
I'm talking to you, bastard.

566
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:16,708
I have a useless son!

567
00:47:18,873 --> 00:47:21,349
He is good for nothing.

568
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:23,046
To whom can I complain about it?

569
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,218
Balu, He just took his bath..

570
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:39,347
..wore a checked lungi..

571
00:47:39,427 --> 00:47:41,109
..and is drinking liquor.

572
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:44,946
Suddenly someone knocked at the door.

573
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:48,655
He went and opened it.

574
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:50,525
Sunanda!

575
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,087
She stood there like a marble statue.

576
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,094
She was tired after returning from office.

577
00:48:00,882 --> 00:48:04,439
She went to the bathroom to take a bath.

578
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:08,936
Balu's imagination started flying high.

579
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:14,255
Sunanda completed her bath..

580
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,067
..and draped a green
towel on her pale body.

581
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:20,461
Her beauty hid precariously..

582
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:24,019
..As she came out of the bathroom.

583
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:26,126
Hey, Didn't you hear what I said?
- Crap!

584
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:29,512
Hey, wait for some time. I'm coming.

585
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:34,672
Sunanda completed her bath..

586
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:38,185
..and draped a green
towel on her pale body.

587
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,724
Her beauty hid precariously..

588
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:44,724
..as she came out of the bathroom.
- Why don't you come quickly?

589
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:47,373
I am dying of knee pain!

590
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:49,200
It will be somewhere around.

591
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,600
If you shout again I will stifle you.

592
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,118
I'm already pumped up!

593
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,588
Sunanda completed her bath..

594
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:01,427
..and came out of the bathroom.
- Old woman! - Father!

595
00:49:01,507 --> 00:49:03,730
I have to go to the toilet urgently.

596
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,654
Come quickly, father.

597
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:08,735
Forget your toilet thing,
I'm pressed with something else.

598
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,967
Sunanda! - Father.
- Hey, shut up!

599
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:15,460
I will come after 5 min. Sunanda!

600
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:21,827
Sunanda completed her bath
and came out draped in a green towel.

601
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:24,670
Balu..
- Father!

602
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:26,239
Where is he?

603
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:29,429
Father, wait. You have to wash me.

604
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:17,654
Deliver these medicines at this address.

605
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,643
Go quickly and not at leisure.

606
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,125
Ok, sir.

607
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:24,551
Why do you stand here.. go.

608
00:50:25,675 --> 00:50:26,886
The idiot!

609
00:50:28,173 --> 00:50:30,434
These accounts don't square up.

610
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:46,715
Did you bring the medicine?
- What? - Did you bring the medicine?

611
00:50:46,952 --> 00:50:49,784
How long does it take
to come from the shop?

612
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:51,318
You are saved because I am going out.

613
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,633
Otherwise I would have skinned you all.

614
00:50:53,713 --> 00:50:55,005
Get lost!

615
00:51:00,228 --> 00:51:01,514
Get lost!

616
00:51:05,255 --> 00:51:06,293
This is the time.

617
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:29,938
From the moment I saw you..

618
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:33,083
I have become a Romeo..

619
00:51:33,164 --> 00:51:36,425
All the songs of our movies
are full of swear words.

620
00:51:36,684 --> 00:51:37,668
You sing it wrong.

621
00:51:37,748 --> 00:51:40,273
If I sing properly,
they will become hymns or what?

622
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:41,483
Another song..

623
00:51:41,563 --> 00:51:46,261
'O girl with the tennis balls,
what great swing you have'

624
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,099
One more!

625
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:50,975
'I will plough the field'

626
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:53,850
'I will plough the field'

627
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:57,603
I'll ask you something.
Don't get angry. - Go ahead.

628
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:01,061
Instead of doing the small thefts,
why not something big?

629
00:52:01,141 --> 00:52:02,489
Hey!

630
00:52:03,775 --> 00:52:06,694
We roam freely because we do small thefts.

631
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:09,396
Remember that.
You shouldn't kill the golden goose.

632
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:10,824
You must raise it well.
- Ok, bro.

633
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:13,375
Why do you get angry? Let's go.

634
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:17,613
Brother, see there.
There seems to be no one in that house.

635
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,012
Let's go. - How do you know
there's no one in that house?

636
00:52:20,195 --> 00:52:22,098
If someone comes after we go in..

637
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:23,418
..we'll be finished.

638
00:52:23,612 --> 00:52:24,865
Hey!

639
00:52:24,945 --> 00:52:29,297
Stop your crap and come quickly.
We will finish in 10 min.

640
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,628
This is a mosquito bat..
Costly item.

641
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:06,090
Hide it quickly.

642
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:26,591
Why are you quiet?

643
00:53:27,266 --> 00:53:28,659
I'm feeling sleepy.

644
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:31,469
That's why I said we should
not go after everything.

645
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,326
Go and take a rest.
- Ok, bro.

646
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:50,085
10 lakhs!

647
00:54:37,427 --> 00:54:39,381
Hey, come here.

648
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:40,903
Come here.

649
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:44,078
Come here.

650
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:45,843
Come close.

651
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:49,233
Come! What is the time?

652
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,205
What is the time?

653
00:54:51,378 --> 00:54:53,091
You idiot!
Would you come at 1 PM?

654
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,638
Rs 1000 cut from your salary!

655
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,255
Go and attend work.

656
00:54:57,077 --> 00:54:58,193
Go now!

657
00:55:01,177 --> 00:55:03,192
Why do you stay like that?
will you beat me?

658
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:04,817
Would you beat me?

659
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:07,342
Come and beat me.

660
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:11,477
Pick of the plate.

661
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,849
Keep it inside.

662
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:19,665
Sir!

663
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:24,007
What is it?

664
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:25,041
I will go home and return.

665
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,462
Will you go if he comes?

666
00:55:26,543 --> 00:55:29,291
You both are doing something fishy.

667
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:32,500
Nothing like that, sir.
My son is complaining of stomach pain.

668
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,264
I will take him to the doctor and return.

669
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,557
Go and come soon.
- Ok, sir.

670
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,996
10 lakhs!

671
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:15,869
Mother, take the kids and start quickly.

672
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:17,512
Where to?
- To our village.

673
00:56:17,815 --> 00:56:19,397
Is your health okay?

674
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:23,090
If you don't start immediately,
I will kill and bury you!

675
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:25,114
Father, we also?

676
00:56:25,322 --> 00:56:26,949
Yes, you also. Start immediately.

677
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:31,342
Elder grandson,
your father is sure to kill me.

678
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,954
Give me some medicine.

679
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:40,154
Grandma, I am putting
the medicines in your bag.

680
00:56:40,235 --> 00:56:41,651
Take whatever you want.

681
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,929
My dear boy, you are very nice.

682
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:48,492
Hey, get in quickly!

683
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,709
I have pain in my legs. - You
will kill me with that. - Don't push.

684
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:54,520
Take care of you will forget things.

685
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,070
Come!

686
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:07,018
Is it still not evening for Giri?

687
00:57:08,106 --> 00:57:09,898
He said that he would go to the doctor.

688
00:57:10,148 --> 00:57:12,682
The story about the doctor is all a lie.

689
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:15,397
Let him come tomorrow and I will see.
Give me the keys.

690
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,360
Keep this inside. I will return shortly.

691
00:57:50,288 --> 00:57:51,740
Come and get him soon.

692
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:12,160
Hello!

693
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,570
Hello.. sir, It is me.. Hari.

694
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,794
Hey Hari..

695
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,264
What is the time now? - I called
to tell you something important.

696
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,834
Tell me quickly.
- Ok, sir.

697
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:26,257
Did you ever feel that
medicines disappeared..

698
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:29,138
..or that calculations
are amiss in our shop?

699
00:58:29,344 --> 00:58:30,728
I did feel that.

700
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:32,588
Why do you ask?

701
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:36,557
Because, since the last
year I and Giri together..

702
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:39,273
..must have stolen at least
a lakh worth of medicines.. you bastard!

703
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:40,276
Idiot!

704
00:58:40,356 --> 00:58:41,902
Hey Hari!

705
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,583
Shut up, you bastard!

706
00:58:44,664 --> 00:58:49,583
What should I call you if you can't
find theft under your feet.. bastard?

707
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:52,271
I will tell you one more thing.
When you went outstation..

708
00:58:52,351 --> 00:58:53,864
..then we robbed even your home.

709
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:58,421
I even peed into the
scotch that you drink.

710
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:01,984
Come tomorrow!

711
00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:03,724
I will tackle you tomorrow.

712
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,387
Why would I come tomorrow, short idiot?

713
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:08,489
I'm going away.

714
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:09,864
You won't find any trace of me.

715
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:14,863
Complain to whoever you want, baldy!

716
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,112
You are getting a
busy tone on this number.

717
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,548
What?!

718
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:28,856
There is a busy tone on this number.

719
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:31,165
I'll see to it.

720
00:59:42,409 --> 00:59:44,423
There is a busy tone on this number.

721
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,997
Please try later.

722
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:56,311
Sir, I'm at the doctor's place.

723
00:59:56,824 --> 00:59:58,318
The doctor came just now.

724
00:59:58,398 --> 01:00:00,704
You fool!
- Sir.

725
01:00:00,784 --> 01:00:02,808
What doctor at midnight?

726
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:05,362
Think before you tell a lie.

727
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:08,641
You have been working
in my shop all these years..

728
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:12,155
..and you stole one
lakh worth of medicines?

729
01:00:12,364 --> 01:00:14,992
A lakh rupees?! I don't know anything.

730
01:00:15,072 --> 01:00:19,502
Hey, Hari told me
everything over phone.

731
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:23,259
I'll catch you wherever
you go and slap your backs.

732
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:24,614
You bastard!

733
01:00:27,286 --> 01:00:30,233
You bastard.. yes, we stole!

734
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,829
Not just a lakh, we took even more.

735
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:35,890
Would you cut my salary?

736
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,148
If you cut my salary,
can't I steal medicines?

737
01:00:39,063 --> 01:00:44,760
Do whatever you want, you bastard!

738
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,246
Please take a seat.

739
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:27,241
Are you Mr. Madhusudhan Rao?
- Yes, sir.

740
01:01:27,362 --> 01:01:29,000
Ok, sir told me.

741
01:01:29,317 --> 01:01:32,106
This is very strange.
Two guys working in your shop..

742
01:01:32,278 --> 01:01:33,884
..they escaped the same day?
- Yes, sir.

743
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,038
They are the ones.

744
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:37,666
Is it him?

745
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:40,070
I understood.

746
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,353
They look like thieves.

747
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,065
Why did you employ them?

748
01:01:44,144 --> 01:01:46,695
It is..
- What did you lose?

749
01:01:46,775 --> 01:01:49,445
I checked. I didn't lose anything.

750
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:53,061
But they claim that they stole
medicines from my shop since two years.

751
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:55,465
Is that so? This looks different.

752
01:01:55,811 --> 01:02:00,014
What more? It seems they robbed my home,
when I went out of the city.

753
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:02,730
Why you say 'it seems'?

754
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:06,259
Don't you know.
- We didn't lose anything significant.

755
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:07,807
What should I note in the complaint?

756
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:11,914
What can I tell you?
You can write whatever you want.

757
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:13,567
But make a watertight case.

758
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,168
Ok, sir told me.
I will take care. You may go.

759
01:02:18,248 --> 01:02:19,802
You must catch them anyhow.

760
01:02:19,882 --> 01:02:20,935
Where will they go?

761
01:02:21,016 --> 01:02:23,876
They will be caught with
some girl in some lodge.

762
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:25,413
You may go.
- Thank you, sir.

763
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:33,579
"Every nerve has turned into a flower.."

764
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,362
"Come here my dear."

765
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:40,659
"Every part of me belongs to you."

766
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:47,808
"Nobody can match you in romance."

767
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:52,822
"Prove it real."

768
01:03:22,134 --> 01:03:26,931
"Rob me, desire is yours."

769
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:32,389
"I will never feel tired for you."

770
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:38,215
"Desire is never silence, find a way."

771
01:03:38,295 --> 01:03:43,809
"Show a world filled with happiness."

772
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:49,929
"Now I belong to you,
take me in your arms."

773
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:55,607
"Unleash your desires, I belong to you.."

774
01:03:55,686 --> 01:04:01,214
"Rob me of everything,
leave a memory behind."

775
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:07,215
"Bring out my feelings, make me yours."

776
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:35,038
"I hid my feelings of
desire for you long back."

777
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,459
"Fall me like a wave from sea."

778
01:04:40,782 --> 01:04:46,349
"Sound of bangles should be heard again."

779
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:52,322
"Anklets should get tired.."

780
01:04:52,402 --> 01:04:57,363
"First time my thirst is quenched,
it is sweet."

781
01:04:57,742 --> 01:05:03,309
"A beautiful feeling has aroused."

782
01:05:03,728 --> 01:05:09,052
"Whole body is longing
to fulfil a desire."

783
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:14,606
"Feelings are drenched in freedom."

784
01:05:14,905 --> 01:05:20,608
"In the warmth of arms.."

785
01:05:20,688 --> 01:05:25,945
"Couldn't live without you.."

786
01:05:26,025 --> 01:05:32,134
"I walked behind you
by becoming half of you."

787
01:05:32,215 --> 01:05:37,403
"Now this is my life.."

788
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:30,769
Why are you beating?
Sir.. sir.. why are you beating? Why?

789
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:33,228
You.. master.. boss..
- Bring him..

790
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:39,297
What?

791
01:06:39,797 --> 01:06:42,000
Where?
- What, brother?

792
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:45,325
Hey, no dramas. Give it.

793
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:46,541
Brother, what should I give?

794
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:49,730
Hey, I have less patience and more BP.

795
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:51,528
I will kill you right here.

796
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,555
Give it.

797
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:56,420
Brother, it is not that..

798
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,757
I will know what you
want only if you tell me.

799
01:07:00,405 --> 01:07:02,581
How will I know what
you want if you don't tell me?

800
01:07:02,661 --> 01:07:04,851
Brother, catch her.

801
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,920
Why are you doing drama? Hey..
- Ouch!

802
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,122
Who is it?

803
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:19,960
She is...
- Fie with your life!

804
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:23,364
Will you bring case? Send her.

805
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:25,054
Hey, send her.

806
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,905
You go to village.

807
01:07:28,985 --> 01:07:31,608
I have a small work,
I will finish it and come.

808
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:34,256
So should I send driver
to drop you at bus stop?

809
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,472
Brother, if we have a vehicle
then if we send the driver..

810
01:07:37,552 --> 01:07:40,324
..he will drop at bus stop.
She is a girl.

811
01:07:42,297 --> 01:07:44,986
Don't have.. they don't have vehicle.

812
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:47,419
Go by share auto.

813
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:49,743
Please.. please..
go.. she will go, brother.

814
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:53,730
Good girl.. please..
brother, she will go.. good girl..

815
01:08:01,027 --> 01:08:03,041
Brother, now tell me what the problem is.

816
01:08:05,175 --> 01:08:08,675
Brother, tell why you
are beating and then beat me.

817
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,146
Whole body is paining.
- Hey, duffer.

818
01:08:12,226 --> 01:08:14,241
If your body is paining
for these beatings..

819
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:16,444
..then I am getting beaten from two days.
What is my condition?

820
01:08:16,524 --> 01:08:18,998
Brother.. - Yes..
- How come you are here?

821
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:21,241
I am here with the
same reason that you are.

822
01:08:21,322 --> 01:08:24,011
I don't know why I am here.
- I too don't know.

823
01:08:24,243 --> 01:08:27,959
Brother.. brother.. brother..
don't beat me.

824
01:08:28,038 --> 01:08:30,796
I will give.. I will give..

825
01:08:30,978 --> 01:08:33,230
Remove the eyes..
- Brother.. brother..

826
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,041
It is.. two bus tickets
from Guntur to Goa..

827
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:39,257
20 beers.. 5 biryani packets..

828
01:08:39,337 --> 01:08:42,662
Auto fares, condom packets, room rent..
after deducting all these..

829
01:08:42,742 --> 01:08:45,945
4,67,934 rupees are left.

830
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:50,011
Hey, don't raise my BP.

831
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:52,932
Brother, I remembered..
only 25,000 is spent.

832
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:56,445
4,70,000 is remaining. I will give it..
I will give it.. - Shut up!

833
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:01,940
Where is the box?
- Box?

834
01:09:02,189 --> 01:09:03,419
Hey fools!

835
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:06,811
If you don't tell where the box is,
till I count till three..

836
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:09,987
..heads will blow off like watermelons.
- Hang on, boss.

837
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:14,797
You want box? Not bag..
- What is it with bag?

838
01:09:15,136 --> 01:09:18,488
Sir, you don't want bag?
You want box? - Deaf rascals!

839
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:20,893
Why do you say bag when I say box?

840
01:09:23,475 --> 01:09:26,542
Sir, should I tell something
that will shock you?

841
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:30,070
I am telling.. I am telling..
you brought wrong people.

842
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:33,313
Wrong.. what wrong people..
you stole the box, right?

843
01:09:33,597 --> 01:09:34,975
Sir, we don't know
anything about that box.

844
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:37,272
Sir, we are petty thieves,
we don't know anything.

845
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:40,042
Hey, bring him.

846
01:09:43,435 --> 01:09:46,016
I think I had seen you somewhere.

847
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:48,691
Yes.. I had somewhere.

848
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:51,651
I am asking about the box
that is stolen from his bag.

849
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,516
I remembered! I remembered!

850
01:09:57,595 --> 01:09:59,475
You came on bike that day, right?

851
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:02,583
That day you had lot
of fun with that girl.

852
01:10:04,136 --> 01:10:06,609
Come on, brother. You are too much.

853
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:09,326
You are a very romantic boy.

854
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,569
Brother, these are all common.

855
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:12,501
I had seen that day.

856
01:10:12,757 --> 01:10:15,407
Brother, you are too much..
- Stop! Stop!

857
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:18,974
What is this? What is this?
- Okay, you both get married.

858
01:10:19,055 --> 01:10:20,461
Get married!

859
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:23,042
Why we came here? What is our work?

860
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:25,784
At least now tell where the box is!

861
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:28,150
Which box, sir?

862
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:31,095
Hey, thrash the three of them.

863
01:10:31,838 --> 01:10:35,393
No! Please! No!
- No, sir. - Hey!

864
01:10:37,136 --> 01:10:39,001
This box.

865
01:10:39,082 --> 01:10:41,610
Why do you ask us when it is with you?

866
01:10:41,813 --> 01:10:43,271
Not this box.

867
01:10:43,351 --> 01:10:46,474
Another box like this. - Sir,
it is available in every medical shop.

868
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:47,894
Vanilla flavour.

869
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:50,461
Earlier it had an offer
of buy two and get one free.

870
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:52,055
I don't know if it is there now.

871
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:54,150
Buy two and get one free?

872
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:56,000
Available in medical shop?

873
01:10:56,081 --> 01:10:58,244
Do you know the value of this box?

874
01:10:58,324 --> 01:11:01,515
55 rupees.
- Rascal! It is worth one crore rupees.

875
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:02,974
One crore rupees?

876
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:07,096
Come on, sir. Why will you give it to this
joker if it is worth one crore rupees?

877
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:10,190
Didn't I say.. didn't I say or not..

878
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,800
..to give to this fool?
But still you gave.

879
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,069
What happened to us now? What happened?

880
01:11:15,368 --> 01:11:17,381
What happened?
- We became fools.

881
01:11:19,096 --> 01:11:21,529
Will you drink beer?
- It should be cool.

882
01:11:25,152 --> 01:11:27,854
Take 100. Have it.
- Okay, brother.

883
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:31,597
Let's go.
- Beat the rascals.

884
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:35,179
Stop! - Sir, it is with me!
Sir, it is with me! Sir, it is with me!

885
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:37,421
Where is it with us?
- It's with me.

886
01:11:37,677 --> 01:11:38,961
It's there. It's in my house, sir.

887
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:41,421
See properly.
Is it the calcium box like this?

888
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,354
Yes, sir. Similar box.

889
01:11:48,556 --> 01:11:50,867
It's there in my house.
- Hey.. - Oh my goodness!

890
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:53,597
Will you escape after stealing
a product worth one crore rupees?

891
01:11:53,677 --> 01:11:56,625
This is cheating.
Betrayal. - Foolish fellow!

892
01:11:56,704 --> 01:11:58,814
Just now I came to know
that it is worth one crore rupees.

893
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:01,219
Lies.. utter lies..

894
01:12:01,298 --> 01:12:03,002
Will you cheat your brother like this?

895
01:12:03,082 --> 01:12:05,219
Didn't you escape with five lakh rupees?

896
01:12:05,298 --> 01:12:08,489
Wonderful!
What are five lakhs and one crore rupees!

897
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:11,219
Sir, listen to me and shoot him.
We will get rid of the jinx. - Shut up!

898
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,259
Why will he kill me when
the box is with me? Sir, shoot him.

899
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:15,921
Shut up!

900
01:12:18,204 --> 01:12:20,421
Dramas are over! Where is the box?

901
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:22,502
Sir, it is in my house, in Guntur.

902
01:12:22,582 --> 01:12:24,475
If anything goes wrong..

903
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:26,759
..it will be lost.. yours..

904
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,220
Both..

905
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,030
Let's go.

906
01:12:31,328 --> 01:12:34,368
Hello! Where? What?

907
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:37,111
Who will untie us if you leave?

908
01:12:37,314 --> 01:12:38,422
Who will untie?

909
01:12:38,707 --> 01:12:41,301
Hey, untie them if you don't mind.

910
01:12:43,545 --> 01:12:44,734
Fie with life!

911
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:49,233
I thought you are my brother
after coming to Guntur.

912
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:53,625
One crore rupees, brother.
- What one crore rupees? Hell with me!

913
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:55,936
I am saying I don't know about the box.

914
01:12:56,016 --> 01:12:58,666
So you stole one crore
rupees without knowing it?

915
01:13:00,435 --> 01:13:02,516
Hey, what is this?

916
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:04,477
What is this romance?

917
01:13:04,556 --> 01:13:07,016
Get married. You both get married.

918
01:13:07,854 --> 01:13:09,152
Let's go!

919
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,497
Hey, come in an hour.
- Okay, sir.

920
01:13:19,577 --> 01:13:22,967
Kantham! Suryakantham!

921
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:27,279
Hey!
- Why you shouted like that?

922
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:29,871
Are you acting smart?

923
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:32,101
You are showing attitude because
I am not beating you, right?

924
01:13:32,181 --> 01:13:36,327
Today you will die in my hands, Die!
Die! - Hey!

925
01:13:36,408 --> 01:13:39,149
What is this? What happened to you?
Are you bitten by mad dog?

926
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:41,289
Shut up! With whom you went to sleep?

927
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:42,997
Why will I sleep with any woman?
- Stop it!

928
01:13:43,078 --> 01:13:45,971
Don't play useless dramas.
You pretended to give me five lakhs..

929
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,689
Tell me on which woman you spend it.

930
01:13:47,769 --> 01:13:49,333
Tell me. Will you tell or not?
- Hey!

931
01:13:49,412 --> 01:13:50,694
Tell me!
- Hey, stop!

932
01:13:51,171 --> 01:13:53,809
What? What happened
to the five lakhs I gave?

933
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:55,301
Hey! Don't play dramas!

934
01:13:55,381 --> 01:13:58,349
Only you know that I kept the five
lakhs given by you under the mattress.

935
01:14:01,225 --> 01:14:03,485
You only took it.
Tell me whom you gave it.

936
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,970
If you don't bring that
bring and give it to me..

937
01:14:06,051 --> 01:14:07,885
..I will tie you up to
the gate like a security dog.

938
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:09,636
Oh! No!
- I will tie you up!

939
01:14:09,716 --> 01:14:12,262
I swear and tell you, five lakh rupees..
- Shut up!

940
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,938
I didn't give it to anybody.
- Go! Go! - Listen to me!

941
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:18,837
You will die! - Hey!
- Go! - Believe me!

942
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:23,323
My God! I think she might kill me!
- Go! - Madam might kill sir.

943
01:14:23,582 --> 01:14:27,377
Hey, what is the nuisance with five lakh
rupees. Start. - Idea, sir. - What is it?

944
01:14:27,626 --> 01:14:29,744
Call Venkat, sir.
He is the right person for this.

945
01:14:31,042 --> 01:14:33,030
My husband has to go to work first..

946
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,662
..so I will collect water first.

947
01:14:34,743 --> 01:14:37,053
If you are in a hurry then
you should come early to collect water.

948
01:14:37,132 --> 01:14:39,787
What will that short fellow
do by going so early to work?

949
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:41,734
So your husband is Prabhas?

950
01:14:41,814 --> 01:14:44,317
Look, I will hit you with the
vessel if you talk about my husband.

951
01:14:44,555 --> 01:14:45,971
Beat! Beat!

952
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:48,620
Sir, just say yes,
I will encounter them all.

953
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:50,653
Thank you, sir.
- Hey!

954
01:14:50,912 --> 01:14:53,193
Why should you kill people
who are fighting for water?

955
01:14:53,273 --> 01:14:55,333
Keep the gun inside.
- Sir..

956
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:00,523
Hello, sir.

957
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:03,527
What? What?
- One minute.

958
01:15:04,956 --> 01:15:06,631
Stop it!

959
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,269
Tell me, sir.

960
01:15:10,695 --> 01:15:12,533
Five lakhs?

961
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,998
No other item from the house is lost?

962
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:18,577
Lock too is not broken.

963
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:22,978
Sir, you don't take any tension.

964
01:15:23,203 --> 01:15:25,257
Give me two days' time. Sir..

965
01:15:25,528 --> 01:15:26,804
Sir, tell by evening.

966
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:28,327
Sir..

967
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,242
Okay, sir.

968
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:35,907
Lock is not broken..
no other item from the house is lost.

969
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:37,658
Khaja..
- Sir..

970
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:40,795
I think we received one
similar complaint recently, right?

971
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:43,247
Yes, sir. Medical shop
owner complained saying..

972
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,507
..medicines were stolen.

973
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:46,599
That's the story!

974
01:15:49,064 --> 01:15:51,237
You go ahead!
- What are you watching?

975
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:52,761
What? I came first?

976
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:55,259
I will show you now.
- What? What?

977
01:15:55,338 --> 01:15:59,052
By the way,
who is the duffer who burgled CI's house?

978
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:03,095
Where is your house?

979
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,429
This one.
- Come.

980
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:08,371
Sir, sir, sir.. if neighbours
see then I will lose my respect.

981
01:16:08,451 --> 01:16:09,765
I will go and bring, sir.

982
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:11,993
Respect for you? Come.

983
01:16:12,073 --> 01:16:13,960
Sir, sir.. please, sir.. ten..

984
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:17,721
Ten minutes, sir. Ten minutes, sir..
sir, sir.. please, sir.. - Okay, go.

985
01:16:18,252 --> 01:16:19,474
Ten minutes.
- Thanks, sir.

986
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:23,570
Where are you going, sir?

987
01:16:24,802 --> 01:16:26,554
You go, he will be with us.

988
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:30,596
It is the matter of one crore rupees,
we cannot trust him.

989
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:34,833
We can trust.. we can trust.

990
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:38,768
He will come back..
he will come back for my sake.

991
01:16:40,747 --> 01:16:41,914
Hey, police!

992
01:16:42,595 --> 01:16:44,076
Oh no!

993
01:16:44,488 --> 01:16:47,266
Hey.. - Brother. - When do
you think this plant was planted?

994
01:16:47,914 --> 01:16:50,715
Don't know, brother..
- Which tree it is? - Don't know.

995
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:54,121
Do you have cigarette?
- No, brother.

996
01:16:56,173 --> 01:16:58,152
Let's borrow.
- Okay, let's go.

997
01:17:01,048 --> 01:17:03,460
Giri, how are you?
- I am fine, sir.

998
01:17:03,654 --> 01:17:07,005
You will be absolutely
fine after stealing five lakhs.

999
01:17:08,854 --> 01:17:10,962
Five lakhs? Which five lakhs, sir?

1000
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,963
Sir, he is acting really good.

1001
01:17:14,942 --> 01:17:16,140
Sir, talk with respect.

1002
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:18,378
Why are you abusing?
- Respect for you? - Hey!

1003
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:21,005
I will shoot you!
- No, sir. I swear I don't know anything.

1004
01:17:21,086 --> 01:17:23,212
What swear?
- Sir..

1005
01:17:24,811 --> 01:17:27,557
Well, there should be a joker with you.

1006
01:17:27,637 --> 01:17:28,606
Where is he?

1007
01:17:34,725 --> 01:17:35,904
Rascal..

1008
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:42,856
Sorry, sir.. sorry.. want to pee.

1009
01:17:43,104 --> 01:17:43,958
Sorry..

1010
01:17:44,038 --> 01:17:46,769
Sir.. sir..
- Get in.. -  I am getting in..

1011
01:17:49,559 --> 01:17:52,498
Brother, jeep is left.
Let's go and get cigarette.

1012
01:17:53,623 --> 01:17:56,251
Take out the vehicle!
Take it out. - Let's go.

1013
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,436
Don't beat, sir.

1014
01:17:58,515 --> 01:18:01,462
Sir, we don't know anything.
- Sir..

1015
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:06,906
Hari..
- Sir, I am Giri.

1016
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,034
So he is Hari?

1017
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,502
Hey.. - Sir..
- He is Giri and he is Hari.

1018
01:18:12,582 --> 01:18:15,330
Sir, sir, should I encounter him?
- You may do it.

1019
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:19,318
First ask him to tell where
five lakhs are. After that, your wish.

1020
01:18:19,966 --> 01:18:21,029
Okay, sir.

1021
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:24,644
Will you give the money
easily without doing dramas?

1022
01:18:24,725 --> 01:18:27,648
Or do you want thrashing
in every half an hour?

1023
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:30,877
I don't have any other work.

1024
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:33,999
Sir.. we really don't know anything.

1025
01:18:34,592 --> 01:18:36,443
Okay. Go ahead.

1026
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:40,929
Sir! - Speak up without getting beaten!
How many times should I ask?

1027
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:43,551
CI sir..
- He doesn't have any work.

1028
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:45,186
Bring water.

1029
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:50,443
Do you know whose house you burgled?

1030
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,633
Whose house, sir..
- CI's house.

1031
01:18:52,712 --> 01:18:54,159
You are finished.

1032
01:19:02,188 --> 01:19:03,417
Hey duffer!

1033
01:19:04,296 --> 01:19:05,661
Give the money and go with him.

1034
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,242
Otherwise they will kill.

1035
01:19:08,673 --> 01:19:11,538
Is it inevitable, brother?
Five lakhs, brother.

1036
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:13,903
Brother, it will take
many years to earn it.

1037
01:19:13,984 --> 01:19:17,877
Hey, duffer!
I think he will beat to death.

1038
01:19:18,078 --> 01:19:20,051
He said he doesn't have
any other work.

1039
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,173
I will give it.
- Give it.

1040
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,822
I will give it.
- Sir, you don't worry.

1041
01:19:26,403 --> 01:19:28,511
I am starting third degree just now.

1042
01:19:28,726 --> 01:19:31,726
Everything will be revealed in an hour.
Okay, sir.

1043
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:37,755
Sir, we will give it.
- Sir, no third degree, we will give it.

1044
01:19:37,835 --> 01:19:39,715
Where you kept the money?

1045
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:43,444
Goa.
- Goa?

1046
01:19:52,796 --> 01:19:54,673
Hey.. - Good morning, sir.
- Where is SI Venkat?

1047
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,282
Sir, he is not coming
to station since one week.

1048
01:19:56,362 --> 01:19:59,146
Where is he dying?
Phone is also switched off. - Sir..

1049
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,060
Greetings, sir.

1050
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:17,438
Name is Madhusudan Rao.

1051
01:20:17,872 --> 01:20:19,047
Having a medical shop at Central.

1052
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:21,642
Brother, workers from the
shop escaped after committing theft.

1053
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:24,547
So what is he doing here?

1054
01:20:24,627 --> 01:20:26,222
Are you a duffer?
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:20:26,506 --> 01:20:29,114
Go to police station.
- Sir, I went to police station.

1056
01:20:29,194 --> 01:20:31,479
SI said he cannot do.

1057
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,020
That's why I came here.

1058
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,899
He is indeed a duffer.

1059
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:38,087
I don't know to speak telugu..

1060
01:20:38,778 --> 01:20:40,182
..I can understand it.
- Very good.

1061
01:20:40,506 --> 01:20:43,885
Sir, they are rogues.
Thrash them badly, sir.

1062
01:20:44,818 --> 01:20:46,224
Okay, okay.

1063
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:48,493
Leave those guys.
- Okay, brother.

1064
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:51,007
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

1065
01:20:51,087 --> 01:20:53,358
Want to eat and go?
- No, sir. - Then go. - I will go.

1066
01:20:54,845 --> 01:20:57,993
Don't you have shame?
With what face are you back?

1067
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:01,520
Anyway you eloped so why didn't you die.

1068
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:05,561
Your brothers must have left by now.

1069
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,060
My hands and legs are shivering/

1070
01:21:08,912 --> 01:21:11,344
Anyway, how did you like him?

1071
01:21:11,546 --> 01:21:13,073
He and his ugly face.

1072
01:21:13,627 --> 01:21:16,925
They came! They will kill me.

1073
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:25,263
Madam, there is a scoundrel
by name Hari living next door.

1074
01:21:25,342 --> 01:21:27,167
Do you know where he went?

1075
01:21:27,912 --> 01:21:30,871
It is..
- Police is searching for him.

1076
01:21:30,951 --> 01:21:32,817
Tell..
- He went to Goa.

1077
01:21:32,896 --> 01:21:35,439
Goa?
- Yes.. Goa..

1078
01:21:35,519 --> 01:21:36,885
Goa..

1079
01:21:49,277 --> 01:21:51,439
Why is the bundle very small?

1080
01:21:51,654 --> 01:21:54,168
Sir, two bus tickets from Guntur to Goa..

1081
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:57,329
20 beers, 5 biryani packets, room rent..

1082
01:21:57,409 --> 01:22:00,925

after deducting all these..

1083
01:22:01,005 --> 01:22:05,194
4,65,934 rupees, sir.. that's it, sir.

1084
01:22:05,573 --> 01:22:08,316
Sir, I will return it
every month if you don't mind.

1085
01:22:08,395 --> 01:22:11,275
You are multi-talented.
- Sir..

1086
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:14,019
Memory is also good.
Sir..

1087
01:22:14,099 --> 01:22:17,384
Come to station daily from
tomorrow at 6 o'clock.. - Okay, sir.

1088
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,600
Clean the latrines properly.

1089
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,087
Latrines, sir..
- Will you not clean?

1090
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,370
I will clean, sir.

1091
01:22:24,449 --> 01:22:27,465
Bring him for company,
your work will become easy.

1092
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:29,208
Yes, yes..

1093
01:22:29,287 --> 01:22:31,329
Both of you get into the vehicle.
- Sir..

1094
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:34,073
Come, come.
- Khaja.

1095
01:22:34,153 --> 01:22:36,208
Sir. - Pack up, we will go.
- Okay, sir.

1096
01:22:37,777 --> 01:22:42,898
Signal.. in ads they
show signals on Himalayas too.

1097
01:22:43,412 --> 01:22:44,993
It is not showing on mountains.

1098
01:22:56,762 --> 01:22:58,735
Sir, what is it in sun?

1099
01:22:58,815 --> 01:23:01,505
Let's go to station.
- No. Not station..

1100
01:23:01,586 --> 01:23:03,708
Your madam will come. Not to station..

1101
01:23:04,006 --> 01:23:05,398
My God!

1102
01:23:05,762 --> 01:23:07,898
Sir. - Yes..
- Phone is ringing..

1103
01:23:07,978 --> 01:23:11,127
Don't pick it.
It must be your madam. Don't pick it.

1104
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:13,978
It's your madam.
Guarantee. - Sir, it is our SI.

1105
01:23:14,059 --> 01:23:15,628
Talk..
- Is it?

1106
01:23:15,884 --> 01:23:16,856
Give it.

1107
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:20,235
Is it found?

1108
01:23:20,748 --> 01:23:22,775
Yes.. yes..

1109
01:23:23,006 --> 01:23:24,087
Goa?

1110
01:23:25,478 --> 01:23:28,411
Oh.. come, come..

1111
01:23:28,748 --> 01:23:30,842
Hey.. - Sir.
- It is found.

1112
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,963
So let us go to station with courage now.
- No. - Where, sir?

1113
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:37,355
Not to station.
- Go to Chaudhary's house.

1114
01:23:37,572 --> 01:23:39,693
Sir..
- Go..

1115
01:23:39,773 --> 01:23:41,815
Okay, sir.

1116
01:23:47,086 --> 01:23:49,438
Panku..
- Madam!

1117
01:23:49,654 --> 01:23:50,789
Madam!

1118
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:55,085
Sir will come. You don't
take any extreme step before that.

1119
01:23:55,342 --> 01:23:56,613
Madam..

1120
01:23:56,693 --> 01:23:59,775
I am afraid. - Hey! - In the meantime
if you take some extreme step.. - Stop.

1121
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:01,384
Madam..
- What happened to your madam?

1122
01:24:01,586 --> 01:24:04,208
Madam closed the door from inside.

1123
01:24:04,287 --> 01:24:05,693
I am afraid.

1124
01:24:05,882 --> 01:24:08,992
Madam! - Hey! Shut up!
- Madam! - Shut up!

1125
01:24:09,369 --> 01:24:11,369
Shut up! Nuisance!

1126
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:15,153
Open the door.

1127
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:19,045
It's me.. dear, it's me.

1128
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:21,342
Do you remember me now? Go away!

1129
01:24:21,422 --> 01:24:23,720
I was busy with work for two, three days.

1130
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:26,451
Now I came. Open the door.

1131
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,369
It is open. Get in.
- My goodness!

1132
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:37,998
Panku.. Panku..

1133
01:24:38,552 --> 01:24:41,363
I cannot tolerate to see you like this.

1134
01:24:41,554 --> 01:24:44,067
Remove the hand. Good at these things!

1135
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:47,229
You talk sweet things to
me but does everything to your wife.

1136
01:24:47,472 --> 01:24:50,931
Anyway, I am your mistress
so you ignore me. - My goodness!

1137
01:24:51,283 --> 01:24:53,378
You give everything and
take them back immediately.

1138
01:24:53,457 --> 01:24:55,823
What are you talking?
What did I take back after giving?

1139
01:24:56,006 --> 01:24:57,027
Oh!

1140
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:00,013
You are acting as if you know nothing.

1141
01:25:00,193 --> 01:25:02,445
You gave it and took it back.

1142
01:25:04,256 --> 01:25:05,891
What did I take back?

1143
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:08,538
You kept five lakhs in almirah, right?

1144
01:25:11,837 --> 01:25:13,634
So where is it?
- Not there?

1145
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:20,539
Hey..
- Sir..

1146
01:25:20,619 --> 01:25:23,662
Sit at home if you don't know to steal.

1147
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:26,310
If there is any theft
in Guntur hereafter..

1148
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:29,025
..first you both will be thrashed.
- Sir..

1149
01:25:29,105 --> 01:25:31,255
Return the amount you
stole from your owner..

1150
01:25:31,661 --> 01:25:33,769
..and join the work.
- Sir.. - Go.

1151
01:25:33,849 --> 01:25:35,729
Thank you, sir. - Go!
- Thank you, sir.

1152
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:37,296
Sir, CI..

1153
01:25:37,877 --> 01:25:40,134
What to do now?
- What to do? You fool!

1154
01:25:40,444 --> 01:25:44,444
We will flee the city. Even if police
spares us, rowdies will not spare us.

1155
01:25:44,524 --> 01:25:45,809
Scoundrels!

1156
01:25:52,594 --> 01:25:54,039
Hey!
- Sir..

1157
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:58,782
Not there?

1158
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:01,295
Thank you, sir.

1159
01:26:02,998 --> 01:26:05,430
Hello?
- Sir, I am in town.

1160
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:07,931
Where should I go?
- Five lakhs are lost.

1161
01:26:08,011 --> 01:26:10,094
It is found, right?
- Lost again.

1162
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,053
Wait a minute.

1163
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:14,958
It is here only..

1164
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:17,579
No, it is with me.

1165
01:26:17,796 --> 01:26:19,890
Not the one that you have,
I am having it.

1166
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:24,094
I searched them and got it after
you lost it. Now they are with me.

1167
01:26:24,173 --> 01:26:26,944
That the one that you have,
it is the one from Chaudhary's house.

1168
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:30,039
What is it? How come it is there?

1169
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:32,404
It is not there, they are lost.
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:26:32,662 --> 01:26:34,891
It should be there for getting lost. How
will they get lost if they are not there.

1171
01:26:35,175 --> 01:26:38,067
Have you lost your brains? These five
lakhs and those five lakhs are different.

1172
01:26:38,146 --> 01:26:40,917
These are lost, those are found. Got it?

1173
01:26:41,337 --> 01:26:44,540
Oh.. I think I understood..

1174
01:26:44,729 --> 01:26:47,202
..but I didn't understand, sir.
Got it. got it, sir.

1175
01:26:47,282 --> 01:26:50,364
Hey, got it or not?
- Yes, got it.

1176
01:26:50,444 --> 01:26:52,242
Now I understood clearly.
- Understood.

1177
01:26:52,322 --> 01:26:54,011
By the way, how is it lost, sir?

1178
01:26:57,173 --> 01:26:59,350
You found the one which is lost, right?

1179
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:00,863
Dumbo..

1180
01:27:01,904 --> 01:27:04,364
These too are lost
in a similar way. - Oh..

1181
01:27:04,444 --> 01:27:07,526
Okay, okay, understood.
Put the phone down, I will see.

1182
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:15,567
Hey! - Sir..
- Stop.

1183
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:18,971
Hey!
- Sir! Sir! Sir!

1184
01:27:19,051 --> 01:27:21,106
Come, Khaja.
- Wait, sir. I am too coming. - Stop.

1185
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:24,823
Stop!
- Stop!

1186
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:31,823
Hey, you! Stop!

1187
01:27:33,377 --> 01:27:35,837
Brother! Brother!
- What? - Tell me something.

1188
01:27:36,108 --> 01:27:38,445
Why are you we running now?
- We stole five lakhs.

1189
01:27:38,525 --> 01:27:40,012
Run!
- Yes. Oh!

1190
01:27:43,027 --> 01:27:45,121
Yuck.. what is this?

1191
01:27:57,082 --> 01:27:58,974
What?
- Hello!

1192
01:27:59,054 --> 01:28:00,622
Tell. I am listening.

1193
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:02,878
Giri and Hari are in Guntur.

1194
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:06,324
I saw them being chased by police in
market. - Is it? - You come immediately.

1195
01:28:06,404 --> 01:28:08,568
I am coming. I am coming.

1196
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:12,324
Brother! Brother!
I gave the five lakhs, right?

1197
01:28:12,404 --> 01:28:15,094
You gave but mine is left.
- Hey, look..

1198
01:28:15,175 --> 01:28:18,920
What about yours?
- He is there! Stop!

1199
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:21,865
I will kill you! Stop!
- Sir! Sir! - Stop!

1200
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:24,932
Why isn't the police leaving us?

1201
01:28:25,012 --> 01:28:27,757
Brother, legs are paining for running.
Let's call the boss.

1202
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,555
Come, let's go.

1203
01:28:31,203 --> 01:28:34,203
What about yours, brother?
- It is.. hand..

1204
01:28:34,568 --> 01:28:38,095
I am asking, what about yours.

1205
01:28:39,636 --> 01:28:42,419
Hey!
- Stop! Stop!

1206
01:28:42,498 --> 01:28:44,351
Brother.. brother, water is here.

1207
01:28:46,932 --> 01:28:48,662
Brother, what about yours?
- It's him..

1208
01:29:04,837 --> 01:29:07,445
I cannot.. stop..

1209
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:12,134
Sir, I cannot..
- I too cannot..

1210
01:29:12,215 --> 01:29:14,162
Shut up and come.
- Okay, sir.

1211
01:29:16,337 --> 01:29:19,648
Hey, stop!
- My God!

1212
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,810
I don't know about
the money they are asking.

1213
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:25,797
I already gave them the
five lakhs they are asking.

1214
01:29:25,877 --> 01:29:27,654
I think it is correct
to get caught by them.

1215
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:29,391
I am going this way.
Your wish after that.

1216
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:32,716
By the way, what about yours?

1217
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,649
Sir! For us, right? I am coming.

1218
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:38,324
Arrest us, sir. It is okay.

1219
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:39,932
Will you make us run?

1220
01:29:41,054 --> 01:29:45,135
Come, let's see.
- Sir, sir.. we will come.- Come.

1221
01:29:45,323 --> 01:29:47,877
Come to the station..
- Stop. - Come.

1222
01:29:54,837 --> 01:29:56,661
Did you bring?

1223
01:29:57,052 --> 01:29:58,796
No, brother.
- Why?

1224
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:00,796
Brother, they are caught.

1225
01:30:00,876 --> 01:30:03,242
Police is creating
a big problem in between.

1226
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:04,701
Giri..

1227
01:30:05,404 --> 01:30:08,742
Hey, stop. Brother,
they took away two people at Giri's house.

1228
01:30:08,998 --> 01:30:10,795
Today they chased in the market.

1229
01:30:10,984 --> 01:30:13,268
Brother, police has become a big problem.

1230
01:30:13,606 --> 01:30:16,079
Who is he?
- Brother, he joined newly.

1231
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:20,011
Where you worked before?
- With Brother Mastan in Hyderabad.

1232
01:30:22,065 --> 01:30:25,498
Learn the work properly.
- Brother, give police their share.

1233
01:30:25,578 --> 01:30:27,511
Otherwise they are causing lot of trouble.

1234
01:30:29,377 --> 01:30:30,499
Call him.

1235
01:30:30,578 --> 01:30:31,930
Hey..
- Sir..

1236
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:37,593
Whether your time of birth or
the time when you starting stealing..

1237
01:30:38,173 --> 01:30:40,646
..your fates are wonderful.

1238
01:30:41,025 --> 01:30:44,349
CI's house, house of CI's mistress..

1239
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:46,958
Will you commit burglary
at both places at the same time?

1240
01:30:47,296 --> 01:30:49,971
Did you find police to be duffers?

1241
01:30:51,295 --> 01:30:54,119
Did you do it after knowing it?
- Sir, why will we do if we know it?

1242
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,105
Sir, generally we are very cautious.

1243
01:30:56,613 --> 01:30:58,755
Tell! Tell!

1244
01:30:58,835 --> 01:31:02,632
Tell! Tell!
- Stop!

1245
01:31:03,863 --> 01:31:06,659
Hey, by giving five.

1246
01:31:06,917 --> 01:31:09,349
..do you want to adjust another five.

1247
01:31:10,592 --> 01:31:13,697
Did I look like a fool?

1248
01:31:14,755 --> 01:31:15,795
Where are another five lakhs?

1249
01:31:15,984 --> 01:31:19,322
Which give lakhs, sir?
- Rascals! Beat them!

1250
01:31:20,646 --> 01:31:24,403
Tell! Tell! Rascals!
- Sir!

1251
01:31:27,269 --> 01:31:30,606
Don't beat me for five minutes, sir.
I have to think little bit.

1252
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:33,511
I don't understand what is happening here.

1253
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:35,768
Did you come to the beginning again?
- Sir, should we thrash?

1254
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:38,052
Thrash!
- Sir, we are giving.

1255
01:31:46,497 --> 01:31:50,078
Greetings, brother.
- Right hand! How are you?

1256
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:53,025
Are you acting smart?

1257
01:31:57,551 --> 01:31:59,795
What happened, brother?
- Don't play dramas?

1258
01:32:00,226 --> 01:32:02,240
Why are you chasing our guys?

1259
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,997
Brother, why do we chase your guys?

1260
01:32:04,078 --> 01:32:06,768
Hey! I am already pissed off!

1261
01:32:07,307 --> 01:32:08,862
Don't irritate me.

1262
01:32:09,511 --> 01:32:12,160
Policemen are eccentric.

1263
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,457
Dog..

1264
01:32:14,524 --> 01:32:15,565
Fie with your life!

1265
01:32:15,645 --> 01:32:17,538
Brother, talk with respect.

1266
01:32:17,618 --> 01:32:19,524
Why should I give you respect?

1267
01:32:20,146 --> 01:32:22,984
Scoundrel!
- Brother, what he is telling is right?

1268
01:32:23,064 --> 01:32:24,173
What right?

1269
01:32:24,253 --> 01:32:27,065
They are not chasing us,
those people are different.

1270
01:32:27,525 --> 01:32:29,003
You don't know anything, you don't talk.

1271
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:31,134
True, brother. Leave them.
They don't know anything.

1272
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:34,836
Hey, rascal! Be in hour limits.

1273
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:38,066
Shut up and stand. - Brother, why
are you shouting? Why are you shouting?

1274
01:32:38,145 --> 01:32:41,146
I will leave.
Take your gun. Take it. - Venkat.

1275
01:32:41,404 --> 01:32:44,039
He is shouting. - You don't know,
keep quiet. - See, brother..

1276
01:32:44,118 --> 01:32:46,105
These are not the police
seen at Giri's house recently.

1277
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:47,456
No. You don't know. Keep quiet.

1278
01:32:47,537 --> 01:32:49,998
Brother, these are not the same
police that chased in the market today.

1279
01:32:50,078 --> 01:32:51,471
Correct but..

1280
01:32:51,551 --> 01:32:53,836
Brother, so why do you say you don't know?
I don't know anything. - Hey..

1281
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:56,780
What happened before is different.
You don't know, keep quiet.

1282
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:59,956
Tell if I don't know. Why is he shouting?
Will he shout? Tell me.

1283
01:33:04,212 --> 01:33:06,902
Wherever you see these boxes in Guntur..

1284
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,144
..you have got nothing to do.

1285
01:33:09,402 --> 01:33:14,347
This is for you,
this is for your constable.

1286
01:33:15,618 --> 01:33:17,591
What are these boxes?

1287
01:33:18,672 --> 01:33:20,443
Tell like that so that I understand.

1288
01:33:20,523 --> 01:33:24,712
Now you only talk. He is shouting
for nothing. Don't we have mouth?

1289
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:26,551
I am telling for the last time.

1290
01:33:26,631 --> 01:33:29,605
Brother, I still don't understand
what you are talking about. - Hey..

1291
01:33:30,253 --> 01:33:33,199
Aren't your men and medical
shop Hari chasing Giri or not?

1292
01:33:33,631 --> 01:33:35,442
Hari and Giri?

1293
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:37,903
Who are they?

1294
01:33:37,983 --> 01:33:39,416
Why he says who they are?

1295
01:33:39,496 --> 01:33:41,226
Hey, bring a hammer.

1296
01:33:41,578 --> 01:33:45,159
Tell him. - Your SI and constables
are chasing our guys from three days.

1297
01:33:45,238 --> 01:33:46,239
Ask your SI.

1298
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:48,536
Did I SI catch..

1299
01:33:49,118 --> 01:33:51,185
..your men?
- Whoever they are, why do you want?

1300
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:52,712
Tell him to leave.

1301
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:54,753
They are having my goods
worth one crore rupees.

1302
01:33:55,204 --> 01:33:57,421
First tell them to leave.

1303
01:33:59,569 --> 01:34:01,246
Useless fellow!

1304
01:34:05,423 --> 01:34:07,329
Sir.. - Hey..
- Tell me, sir.

1305
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,154
Give the phone to him.
- Who sir?

1306
01:34:09,234 --> 01:34:11,168
Give to SI.
- Sir, for you..

1307
01:34:11,247 --> 01:34:12,275
Who?
- CI sir.

1308
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:13,613
What is it with him?

1309
01:34:13,694 --> 01:34:15,438
Sir..
- Tell me.

1310
01:34:20,099 --> 01:34:23,963
Now.. did you too steal five lakhs?

1311
01:34:26,518 --> 01:34:28,586
In the house of CI's mistress?

1312
01:34:28,936 --> 01:34:31,423
No.. CI's house.

1313
01:34:31,613 --> 01:34:33,518
I stole from CI's house.

1314
01:34:33,597 --> 01:34:35,099
No. It's me.

1315
01:34:35,179 --> 01:34:37,815
What about me?
- In the house of CI's mistress?

1316
01:34:38,626 --> 01:34:40,153
My goodness!

1317
01:34:40,572 --> 01:34:42,234
You are not an ordinary person.

1318
01:34:42,314 --> 01:34:43,976
So what if we were not caught
for the second time?

1319
01:34:44,056 --> 01:34:45,706
You would have escaped with five lakhs.

1320
01:34:45,787 --> 01:34:46,963
I mean..

1321
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,774
I would have lived
in Guntur by begging.

1322
01:34:52,935 --> 01:34:55,746
You and I are not friends.
Don't talk to me.

1323
01:34:56,652 --> 01:35:01,016
Sorry..
how can you not talk to me?

1324
01:35:01,096 --> 01:35:04,813
You kept quiet by watching
when they beat me like anything.

1325
01:35:04,894 --> 01:35:06,327
Did you accept?

1326
01:35:06,407 --> 01:35:08,516
Didn't you jump without telling me?

1327
01:35:09,759 --> 01:35:13,773
Okay, I will not talk to you now.
I will talk after sometime.

1328
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:18,070
Khaja!
- Sir, I am coming.

1329
01:35:18,731 --> 01:35:20,394
Remove it.
- Sir, it is..

1330
01:35:20,474 --> 01:35:22,435
You heard it correct, remove it.

1331
01:35:23,096 --> 01:35:24,259
Go.

1332
01:35:26,246 --> 01:35:28,542
Sir, should we really go?
- Are you feeling sad?

1333
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:31,731
Not at all, sir. - I will break
your knees if I see you again.

1334
01:35:31,811 --> 01:35:33,623
Go!
- Yes, sir.

1335
01:35:37,746 --> 01:35:39,596
Hey! - Tell me, sir.
- Give him the phone. - Who, sir?

1336
01:35:40,298 --> 01:35:42,015
SI.
- Sir..

1337
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:43,488
Who?
- CI.

1338
01:35:43,568 --> 01:35:44,786
He is..

1339
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:47,461
Sir.
- Are you keeping the phone..

1340
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:49,002
No. What happened?

1341
01:35:49,082 --> 01:35:51,813
How many times should I call you?
- Oh, you called me, sir?

1342
01:35:52,502 --> 01:35:54,434
Yes, sir. There are two missed calls.

1343
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,231
Sir, I kept it in silent mode
because battery was going down.

1344
01:35:57,529 --> 01:35:59,893
Okay, leave them.
- What about five lakhs?

1345
01:35:59,972 --> 01:36:02,582
No need. Leave them.
- No need?

1346
01:36:02,826 --> 01:36:04,284
So should I keep, sir?

1347
01:36:04,364 --> 01:36:07,338
Mental! Leave them and
come to our station urgently.

1348
01:36:08,797 --> 01:36:10,501
Okay, sir.

1349
01:36:11,609 --> 01:36:15,068
Brother, I told. - Since it is
first time so I will not tell.

1350
01:36:15,784 --> 01:36:17,474
Next time I will kill.

1351
01:36:19,515 --> 01:36:21,690
Will you eat food? Then go.

1352
01:36:35,095 --> 01:36:36,892
Sir, I didn't feel bad
when madam beat you.

1353
01:36:36,972 --> 01:36:38,528
Sir, who is he to scold you?

1354
01:36:38,608 --> 01:36:40,920
His business is running
because you are ignoring it.

1355
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,811
Sir, what will be his situation
if you take interest?

1356
01:36:44,878 --> 01:36:48,797
Finally constable is also
showing sympathy on me.

1357
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:50,528
Yuck!

1358
01:36:58,122 --> 01:37:00,500
Brother, I think this useless batch
will also be somewhere around.

1359
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:02,891
Hey, auto!
- Auto!

1360
01:37:04,487 --> 01:37:06,257
Ouch!

1361
01:37:06,716 --> 01:37:08,473
Go.

1362
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:17,878
Hey! Hey!
Brother, this is not share auto!

1363
01:37:18,514 --> 01:37:20,270
What? What is this?
- Who?

1364
01:37:21,014 --> 01:37:22,878
Hey, brother..

1365
01:37:23,824 --> 01:37:28,054
Hello.. master.. hello..
this auto is not empty.. get down..

1366
01:37:29,733 --> 01:37:33,527
Stop.
- Who are they?

1367
01:37:34,203 --> 01:37:37,595
Oh.. that is the matter.
They have set us in the auto like this.

1368
01:37:38,055 --> 01:37:41,351
Go. - Go.
- Take wherever brother tells to go.

1369
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:44,365
Nothing to fear.. don't fear.

1370
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
What happened?

1371
01:37:51,716 --> 01:37:53,662
I am hurt.

1372
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:57,309
Tell in detail.

1373
01:37:58,498 --> 01:37:59,795
Don..

1374
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,999
Will he call me dog?

1375
01:38:04,256 --> 01:38:06,188
He abused the department.

1376
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:08,471
I will teach him a lesson.

1377
01:38:24,229 --> 01:38:25,364
What shall we do, sir?

1378
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:33,565
Encounter!

1379
01:38:34,134 --> 01:38:36,390
Don't spare anyone.
- Yes, sir.

1380
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:44,051
Brother.. hey.. brother..
why are you beating me, brother?

1381
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:47,402
You should be beating him. - Why do we
beat him when you did everything?

1382
01:38:47,483 --> 01:38:48,863
What did I go, brother?

1383
01:38:48,943 --> 01:38:50,592
Brother Giri did everything.

1384
01:38:50,782 --> 01:38:52,903
No, no. He won't do it,
you should have done.

1385
01:38:52,983 --> 01:38:55,726
Brother! Brother!
Brother, why don't you tell?

1386
01:38:55,806 --> 01:38:57,456
Tell that you did everything.

1387
01:38:57,537 --> 01:39:00,159
Why are you blaming me
when you did everything? - Brother!

1388
01:39:01,322 --> 01:39:03,592
Hold on! Hold on!

1389
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:06,132
If you think that way then
we both did it together.

1390
01:39:06,212 --> 01:39:07,889
Why are you beating me alone?

1391
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:11,159
Beat brother Giri too..
brother Giri.. come here.. come here..

1392
01:39:11,239 --> 01:39:13,268
Go.
- What you both did together?

1393
01:39:15,443 --> 01:39:17,146
We did it together, sir?

1394
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:20,253
Hey! Remove, sir.
- Hey, come here!

1395
01:39:21,226 --> 01:39:22,902
Come here!

1396
01:39:32,252 --> 01:39:34,760
Who from these two? Tell me.

1397
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:44,497
Your father?
- Yes..

1398
01:39:49,699 --> 01:39:51,496
Why are you laughing?
- Brother Giri..

1399
01:39:51,577 --> 01:39:55,065
This is not at all a matter
when compared to our problems.

1400
01:40:00,104 --> 01:40:03,401
Okay. Coming to the matter..

1401
01:40:04,023 --> 01:40:05,860
Very small time..

1402
01:40:06,252 --> 01:40:08,387
Very very small time, I.. sorry..

1403
01:40:08,779 --> 01:40:11,063
We are going to settle down. Okay?

1404
01:40:11,483 --> 01:40:13,537
I will marry your daughter
in a grand manner.

1405
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,929
What will you marry?
- Beating again?

1406
01:40:17,387 --> 01:40:19,010
Leave I say.
- Why don't you listen when I am telling?

1407
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:20,955
Hold on! Hold on!

1408
01:40:29,158 --> 01:40:30,063
Look elder man!

1409
01:40:30,902 --> 01:40:34,752
You don't know us.
I enjoy police and mafia support.

1410
01:40:34,832 --> 01:40:36,523
If anything goes wrong..

1411
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:41,199
Hey! - Who are you threatening?
- Hey!

1412
01:40:43,456 --> 01:40:46,645
Didn't I tell..
Didn't I tell they will come?

1413
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,067
You go inside.

1414
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:53,234
What do you want?
- Sir..

1415
01:40:53,418 --> 01:40:54,574
I will go if you give my money.

1416
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,514
Brother..
Don't beat! Don't beat!

1417
01:41:07,485 --> 01:41:08,793
Hey, who do you want?

1418
01:41:14,956 --> 01:41:16,685
Didn't I say my guys will come?

1419
01:41:17,096 --> 01:41:19,280
Brother, I said.. shoot them.

1420
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,399
Hey, who is this duffer?

1421
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:24,555
Giri.
- Hey, come here.. come here.

1422
01:41:24,636 --> 01:41:26,135
Brother, I am Hari. Hari..

1423
01:41:28,739 --> 01:41:30,015
Is he Giri?
- Yes, Giri..

1424
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:32,783
What is the nuisance with Hari and Giri?
Where is the box?

1425
01:41:33,302 --> 01:41:34,795
Where is the box?
- Brother, it is with Giri.

1426
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:37,583
Where are Hari and Giri? Tell me.

1427
01:41:37,844 --> 01:41:39,509
Over there..

1428
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:47,259
I remember something by seeing you.
Cat closes its eyes..

1429
01:41:47,507 --> 01:41:50,274
..and drinks milks,
it thinks nobody is watching it.

1430
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,436
It thinks he fools everyone.

1431
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:53,788
Get up! Duffer! Get up!

1432
01:41:54,912 --> 01:41:57,582
Hey, bring to our den.
- Okay, brother.

1433
01:41:58,122 --> 01:41:59,408
Come.

1434
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:00,954
Get up.

1435
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,144
Let's go.
- I want him.

1436
01:42:04,555 --> 01:42:06,014
I want Anushka.

1437
01:42:06,837 --> 01:42:08,956
Bring her and take him away.

1438
01:42:09,171 --> 01:42:11,442
Duffer! Move!
- Sir.. - Hey!

1439
01:42:11,521 --> 01:42:13,140
Do you know who am I?

1440
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:16,166
Shut up!

1441
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:18,858
Hey!

1442
01:42:22,577 --> 01:42:26,934
Quiet! Once I say quiet, keep quiet.

1443
01:42:28,262 --> 01:42:29,572
Give food to father.

1444
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:00,305
Hey, come.

1445
01:43:06,207 --> 01:43:08,207
Brother, lot of smoke is coming.

1446
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:10,650
What is this?

1447
01:43:58,984 --> 01:44:00,963
Get in!

1448
01:44:05,082 --> 01:44:06,487
Bloody woman!

1449
01:44:06,568 --> 01:44:08,012
Who is she?

1450
01:44:33,891 --> 01:44:34,800
Go!

1451
01:45:25,338 --> 01:45:27,609
Sister! He is not that guy.

1452
01:45:29,078 --> 01:45:30,139
I know.

1453
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:32,376
So what to do?

1454
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:37,186
Whoever wants this guy
will bring him but..

1455
01:45:39,198 --> 01:45:41,100
..not that guy.

1456
01:45:45,975 --> 01:45:49,780
Sir.. sir.. don't beat, sir..
please.. sir..

1457
01:45:56,244 --> 01:45:57,715
Who is she?

1458
01:45:58,104 --> 01:45:59,855
Revolver Rani.

1459
01:46:00,449 --> 01:46:02,644
She came for you?
- Yes, sir.

1460
01:46:04,094 --> 01:46:05,476
Rascal!

1461
01:46:05,556 --> 01:46:07,909
I lost three guys because of you.

1462
01:46:08,557 --> 01:46:10,622
Kill him after the box is found.

1463
01:46:12,632 --> 01:46:14,135
By the way, where is the box?
- Box..

1464
01:46:14,654 --> 01:46:17,064
Where is the box? Where?
- Sir, how will I know if you ask me.

1465
01:46:17,248 --> 01:46:19,172
Anyway, the box is with Kiran.

1466
01:46:20,037 --> 01:46:21,864
Where is Giri?
- Revolver Rani took him away.

1467
01:46:41,681 --> 01:46:43,541
Where is she found now?

1468
01:46:43,844 --> 01:46:45,400
Ouch!

1469
01:46:57,152 --> 01:47:02,600
"Don't fall in love.. if you do.."

1470
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,936
"Heart will be broken.."
- Sister, phone.. - Pick it.

1471
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:06,805
"Don't fall in love."

1472
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,417
Hello.
- Hello.

1473
01:47:08,497 --> 01:47:10,914
Hari? - No. Are you Rani?
- No.

1474
01:47:11,356 --> 01:47:12,957
So why did you pick?
- Why you called up?

1475
01:47:13,037 --> 01:47:14,092
I called for Rani.

1476
01:47:14,171 --> 01:47:15,302
I picked up the phone
by thinking it is Hari.

1477
01:47:15,382 --> 01:47:17,648
Give the phone to Rani.
- Give the phone to Hari.

1478
01:47:19,054 --> 01:47:19,983
Tell him to bring.

1479
01:47:21,431 --> 01:47:22,609
Sir, I don't want, you talk.

1480
01:47:22,689 --> 01:47:25,269
Sir, I don't want, you talk.
No, sir. - What is it? - You talk.

1481
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:28,373
Are you duffer?
- I don't want. You talk, sir.

1482
01:47:34,945 --> 01:47:38,125
What is it with her? She is tempting.
- Sir, she is like that only.

1483
01:47:38,752 --> 01:47:41,162
Talk.. talk..

1484
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:44,989
I am Jackie.
- Where is Hari?

1485
01:47:45,069 --> 01:47:47,130
Where is Giri?
- I want Hari.

1486
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:49,561
I want Giri. - Exchange.
- Exchange.

1487
01:47:49,822 --> 01:47:52,514
I will not go, brother.
I will not go.

1488
01:47:52,594 --> 01:47:53,475
Hey!

1489
01:47:59,358 --> 01:48:01,661
Call auto. Auto!

1490
01:48:02,893 --> 01:48:04,720
Where to go?

1491
01:48:20,774 --> 01:48:22,720
Useless woman.

1492
01:48:23,703 --> 01:48:25,713
She doesn't have time sense.

1493
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,288
Brother, auto..
- Where has auto come?

1494
01:48:33,021 --> 01:48:34,698
Yes..
- No, sir.

1495
01:48:37,064 --> 01:48:39,799
Come! Come!

1496
01:48:40,436 --> 01:48:42,815
Sir, my money. Hey, stop.

1497
01:48:45,962 --> 01:48:49,356
Business..
- Hey, send Giri here.

1498
01:48:49,626 --> 01:48:51,378
Send Hari.

1499
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:54,728
First send Giri,
I will send Hari after that.

1500
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:58,113
Crap! I had seen enough!

1501
01:48:58,286 --> 01:49:00,394
First you send.
- Bloody woman!

1502
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:03,107
Very smart!

1503
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:05,604
Okay.

1504
01:49:05,962 --> 01:49:08,935
You send him, I will send this guy.

1505
01:49:11,387 --> 01:49:14,005
Sir.. sir.. please, sir..
I will not go to her.

1506
01:49:14,085 --> 01:49:15,853
She will eat me with beer.
- Hey..

1507
01:49:15,932 --> 01:49:18,902
Hey, don't act like a dumbo.

1508
01:49:21,756 --> 01:49:24,436
Had food?
- Yes, sir.

1509
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:28,954
Go. Should I throw you away?
- Sir.. - Go!

1510
01:49:29,034 --> 01:49:30,284
Go!

1511
01:49:34,372 --> 01:49:37,064
Madam! Madam!
I will go if you give money.

1512
01:49:41,411 --> 01:49:44,685
Brother.. brother.. please, brother..
don't send me to her..

1513
01:49:44,765 --> 01:49:47,583
She will kill me..
- Whatever it is, go.

1514
01:49:50,739 --> 01:49:52,675
Go! - Madam! Madam!
- Come.

1515
01:49:56,716 --> 01:49:59,062
Go, go.
- Madam, push the auto.

1516
01:49:59,143 --> 01:50:01,430
Go!
- Yes, sister.

1517
01:50:09,527 --> 01:50:10,586
Box.

1518
01:50:16,608 --> 01:50:18,640
Hey, scoundrel!

1519
01:50:19,807 --> 01:50:21,029
Box.

1520
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:25,558
Box.. box..

1521
01:50:32,349 --> 01:50:34,391
Box.. box..

1522
01:50:34,738 --> 01:50:38,802
Box.. Sir, Hari has fooled us.

1523
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:40,867
Sir.. that box is with him.

1524
01:50:40,948 --> 01:50:42,479
Sir.. catch him at any cost.

1525
01:50:42,694 --> 01:50:45,926
Otherwise we both
will become fools. Hari..

1526
01:50:46,006 --> 01:50:50,056
Hari is having the box,
we shouldn't leave him. Sir.. sir..

1527
01:51:11,948 --> 01:51:13,699
Sister! Father's call.

1528
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,721
Phone.. phone..

1529
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,615
I want Hari.

1530
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:19,815
I will not give.

1531
01:51:19,895 --> 01:51:22,021
I will give 10,000.

1532
01:51:24,658 --> 01:51:26,128
I will give five lakhs.

1533
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,885
Next bullet will enter Hari's brain.

1534
01:51:30,367 --> 01:51:31,935
20 lakhs..

1535
01:51:37,719 --> 01:51:39,135
He doesn't know to do business.

1536
01:51:42,248 --> 01:51:44,550
Open.. Sir..

1537
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:47,027
Sir..
- Open fast.

1538
01:51:48,604 --> 01:51:52,788
Sir.. sir..
- Come.

1539
01:51:57,125 --> 01:51:59,146
Hey..

1540
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:02,693
Take out the box.
Take out the box!

1541
01:52:09,452 --> 01:52:10,911
Show!

1542
01:52:21,398 --> 01:52:24,262
Get up! Get up!

1543
01:52:24,533 --> 01:52:25,560
Sir..

1544
01:52:26,652 --> 01:52:30,770
Played enough dramas..
He will tell if you are killed.

1545
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:34,488
Sir, sir.. I will tell the truth.
I know the box that you are asking for.

1546
01:52:34,569 --> 01:52:36,230
Sir, we don't know where the box is.

1547
01:52:36,858 --> 01:52:39,721
If you leave us then we
will return the box after it is found.

1548
01:52:39,801 --> 01:52:43,679
Sir.. sir.. I remembered..
I remembered.. I will tell.. I will tell..

1549
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,204
Quiet!

1550
01:52:46,350 --> 01:52:47,669
Rascal!

1551
01:52:49,884 --> 01:52:52,770
Now tell.
- Sir.. phone..

1552
01:52:53,809 --> 01:52:55,344
Give phone.

1553
01:52:55,423 --> 01:52:56,363
Give.

1554
01:53:00,034 --> 01:53:01,980
Sir.. lock..

1555
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,493
He says lock is there.

1556
01:53:03,573 --> 01:53:05,414
Take.

1557
01:53:10,292 --> 01:53:12,359
You have phone, right?

1558
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:16,267
No balance, sir.. no balance..
- He doesn't have balance..

1559
01:53:17,356 --> 01:53:18,729
Yuck!

1560
01:53:18,810 --> 01:53:20,185
No need. I will catch.

1561
01:53:20,668 --> 01:53:21,646
I will lift.

1562
01:53:25,789 --> 01:53:27,372
Hello.
- Hello.

1563
01:53:27,452 --> 01:53:29,872

How dare you call me!

Sir, I am coming.

1570
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:50,612
He is coming.

1571
01:53:50,826 --> 01:53:53,386
Who? Who opened my shop?

1572
01:53:54,113 --> 01:53:56,604
Sir, why did you come here?

1573
01:53:58,485 --> 01:53:59,658
Hey..

1574
01:54:00,405 --> 01:54:02,597
You took the people..

1575
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:04,524
..who came to my den, right?

1576
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:09,411
You stole the box from me..

1577
01:54:09,756 --> 01:54:11,175
..took away my men..

1578
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:13,783
..and made me..
- Sir.. sir..

1579
01:54:13,863 --> 01:54:16,662
Water.. water..
- Drink water..

1580
01:54:16,853 --> 01:54:19,067
Which box?
- Hey! Shut up! Lies!

1581
01:54:19,301 --> 01:54:21,083
Sir, the box is with him.

1582
01:54:21,162 --> 01:54:22,716
Give sir's box to him.

1583
01:54:22,796 --> 01:54:24,774
Give sir's box to him.

1584
01:54:24,854 --> 01:54:27,291
Sir, he is telling lies again.
It is with him!

1585
01:54:27,448 --> 01:54:29,203
Sir, thrash this bald fellow!

1586
01:54:29,283 --> 01:54:31,037
Hey!
- Sir.. sir..

1587
01:54:31,117 --> 01:54:33,016
Quiet!
- Where is the box?

1588
01:54:33,096 --> 01:54:36,242
Hey, is it okay if I shoot on head?

1589
01:54:36,579 --> 01:54:38,639
Bald.. bald..
- Okay..

1590
01:54:38,863 --> 01:54:41,898
Is it okay if I shoot on head... no, sir.
- Tell.. tell..

1591
01:54:42,162 --> 01:54:43,456
Tell..
- Sir..

1592
01:54:44,118 --> 01:54:45,804
It's with my brother-in-law..
- What are you saying?

1593
01:54:45,885 --> 01:54:47,588
Who is his brother-in-law?
- Who knows?

1594
01:54:47,668 --> 01:54:50,074
Sir, I will call and get it.
- Call.. call up..

1595
01:54:50,323 --> 01:54:53,760
Don't beat, sir. Don't beat..
- Rascal..

1596
01:54:55,653 --> 01:54:59,697
Hello, brother-in-law.
You come to our medical shop urgently.

1597
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:01,868
Both Hari and Giri are here.

1598
01:55:02,074 --> 01:55:04,733
Brother-in-law, I am waiting..
come soon.

1599
01:55:05,338 --> 01:55:06,604
Sir, he is coming.

1600
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:09,652
If I ask him then he will take his name..

1601
01:55:09,976 --> 01:55:12,269
..if I ask him, he takes your name..

1602
01:55:12,349 --> 01:55:14,582
If I ask you then you are taking
some other person's name.

1603
01:55:14,662 --> 01:55:16,604
How many more fools are there?

1604
01:55:16,684 --> 01:55:18,538
Sir..
- Shut up, rascal!

1605
01:55:18,618 --> 01:55:21,295
Sit there.. move..

1606
01:55:21,523 --> 01:55:23,966
Sit! Rat!

1607
01:55:27,653 --> 01:55:31,025
Sir, he sat normally.

1608
01:55:31,998 --> 01:55:33,458
What duffer?

1609
01:55:33,771 --> 01:55:36,225
Not like eating,
sit like you are in loo.

1610
01:55:37,286 --> 01:55:39,599
Sir, stomach is there..
- Should I remove the stomach?

1611
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:42,020
No, sir. I will sit. I will sit.

1612
01:55:43,382 --> 01:55:44,798
Hey..

1613
01:55:48,064 --> 01:55:49,556
Why are you laughing?

1614
01:55:50,118 --> 01:55:52,799
Tell gun.
- Our guy was enough.

1615
01:55:53,047 --> 01:55:54,734
By now the work would have been finished.

1616
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:57,199
Who? This lame guy?

1617
01:55:58,226 --> 01:55:59,253
What will he do?

1618
01:55:59,426 --> 01:56:01,599
He will point the gun to the left
and collect from right.

1619
01:56:02,259 --> 01:56:03,849
How will he put the gun? Like this?

1620
01:56:06,389 --> 01:56:08,128
He will out like this too.

1621
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:12,409
Sometimes he will collect like this too.

1622
01:56:17,015 --> 01:56:18,570
Hey, who are you all?

1623
01:56:18,873 --> 01:56:19,878
Move.

1624
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:22,408
Why are you here?

1625
01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:25,652
What are you doing here, brother?

1626
01:56:25,731 --> 01:56:27,122
What are you doing here?

1627
01:56:27,202 --> 01:56:29,706
I told you many times not
to interfere in my business.

1628
01:56:30,115 --> 01:56:31,684
Go.
- Sir, sir..

1629
01:56:32,029 --> 01:56:33,532
Sir, he is my brother-in-law.

1630
01:56:34,603 --> 01:56:36,408
Is he your brother-in-law?
- Yes, sir.

1631
01:56:37,435 --> 01:56:39,510
So is that box with him?

1632
01:56:39,591 --> 01:56:40,560
Yes, sir.

1633
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:44,052
I know you are that rogue.

1634
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:45,954
By taking the box from me..

1635
01:56:46,034 --> 01:56:49,046
..by taking my money,
by giving so much tension..

1636
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,149
..will you cause so much trouble to me.
- Yes.

1637
01:56:52,452 --> 01:56:54,041
We stole the box from you.

1638
01:56:54,121 --> 01:56:56,159
Look don, you know something?

1639
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:58,202
You gave me ten lakhs to keep quiet.

1640
01:56:58,283 --> 01:56:59,576
Do you know who stole it?

1641
01:56:59,655 --> 01:57:01,088
These two guys.

1642
01:57:01,596 --> 01:57:02,862
Tell..

1643
01:57:02,943 --> 01:57:05,306
Sorry, sir.. sorry..

1644
01:57:05,386 --> 01:57:06,949
Rascals!

1645
01:57:07,029 --> 01:57:09,035
You stole from my brother-in-law too?
- You stop.

1646
01:57:09,425 --> 01:57:12,137
Rascal stole 3,70,000 from my sister.

1647
01:57:12,408 --> 01:57:14,051
Mine is one lakh rupees.

1648
01:57:14,131 --> 01:57:15,868
Sir, they peed in my whisky.

1649
01:57:15,948 --> 01:57:17,036
First give my sister's money.

1650
01:57:17,115 --> 01:57:18,636
First my one lakh rupees, sir.

1651
01:57:18,716 --> 01:57:20,333
First my one lakh.
- Shut up!

1652
01:57:20,582 --> 01:57:22,917
Shut up! One minute! Shut up!

1653
01:57:23,630 --> 01:57:24,819
One minute! Shut up!

1654
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:28,213
You stole one crore rupees from me.

1655
01:57:28,884 --> 01:57:30,753
You stole one lakh rupees from him.

1656
01:57:31,457 --> 01:57:33,371
You stole ten lakh rupees from him.

1657
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,198
Who gave it? I had given.

1658
01:57:37,802 --> 01:57:39,780
This is lot of money.

1659
01:57:40,073 --> 01:57:43,014
This madam and a lame guy..

1660
01:57:43,315 --> 01:57:46,234
..crossed the border with a bloody woman.

1661
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,667
For three lakhs. Three lakhs.

1662
01:57:49,317 --> 01:57:51,856
What is with you? You don't have fear.

1663
01:57:51,936 --> 01:57:53,640
Sorry, sir.. sorry..

1664
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:56,386
Come.

1665
01:57:56,559 --> 01:57:59,423
Shift to our den. Shift.

1666
01:57:59,596 --> 01:58:01,671
This will be settled there. Come.

1667
01:58:01,752 --> 01:58:03,694
How will 15 people fit into scorpio?

1668
01:58:05,088 --> 01:58:07,391
Sir, I have car with me.

1669
01:58:07,726 --> 01:58:10,623
He has got a car.

1670
01:58:10,862 --> 01:58:12,516
Five people sit in his car..

1671
01:58:12,595 --> 01:58:14,288
..and ten people sit in our Scorpio.

1672
01:58:14,493 --> 01:58:16,893
Everything is clear. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1673
01:58:17,596 --> 01:58:19,185
Do you want me to sit behind in Scorpio?

1674
01:58:19,265 --> 01:58:21,336
Do you think I am new here?

1675
01:58:21,417 --> 01:58:24,126
Seats are in different position.
It will cause vomiting.

1676
01:58:24,206 --> 01:58:27,239
Take your gun.
You don't know to do business.

1677
01:58:27,704 --> 01:58:29,532
I am going to my brother Mastan.

1678
01:58:30,136 --> 01:58:32,136
Move.

1679
01:58:32,216 --> 01:58:34,786
What man? What are you watching?

1680
01:58:35,217 --> 01:58:36,979
Let's go in comfortable position.

1681
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:38,872
He is a don from Mumbai?

1682
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,759
Encounter! Don't spare anyone.

1683
01:59:22,764 --> 01:59:24,375
Not even one guy is left.

1684
01:59:24,454 --> 01:59:26,180
Sir, is my promotion confirmed?

1685
01:59:26,841 --> 01:59:30,441
Now special team investigations on
the incident that happened here..

1686
01:59:30,613 --> 01:59:32,635
..CBI inquiries..

1687
01:59:32,819 --> 01:59:34,689
..pressure from Home Minister.

1688
01:59:34,862 --> 01:59:36,894
Coverage from Central media.

1689
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:38,992
Are these necessary?

1690
01:59:39,726 --> 01:59:43,738
They fought between them
and died because of old enmity.

1691
01:59:44,061 --> 01:59:45,445
Case close!

1692
01:59:45,525 --> 01:59:47,586
Another case from tomorrow.

1693
01:59:48,279 --> 01:59:50,549
What do you say?
- Sir, what about my promotion?

1694
01:59:50,628 --> 01:59:52,581
You too will get whenever I get.

1695
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:55,230
What are you doing to do
by taking promotion now?

1696
01:59:55,310 --> 01:59:56,571
Come.

1697
02:00:03,726 --> 02:00:08,061
Brother Giri.. brother Giri..
get up.. get up.. brother Giri, get up.

1698
02:00:10,862 --> 02:00:12,710
Get up.. come.. come..

1699
02:00:23,369 --> 02:00:24,430
What happened? Come.

1700
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:25,608
Where do you want to go?

1701
02:00:25,688 --> 02:00:28,029
No money in pocket,
no clothes to wear.

1702
02:00:30,936 --> 02:00:32,407
Keep this 200.

1703
02:00:33,207 --> 02:00:35,131
Should I take this 200..

1704
02:00:35,211 --> 02:00:36,708
..and go to America?

1705
02:00:38,784 --> 02:00:40,189
Look, this 200..

1706
02:00:40,762 --> 02:00:42,427
Keep inside.. keep this too.

1707
02:00:43,185 --> 02:00:46,828
You live happily by giving
five lakh rupees for interest.

1708
02:00:46,908 --> 02:00:51,109
I will roam the streets without
knowing how to spend 200. Go!

1709
02:00:51,189 --> 02:00:53,023
Hey, tell so that I understand.

1710
02:00:53,693 --> 02:00:56,967
If you give some money
from your five lakhs..

1711
02:00:57,047 --> 02:00:59,811
..I too can live by giving it
on interest.

1712
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,395
How much?
- Half.

1713
02:01:02,475 --> 02:01:03,530
Half?

1714
02:01:03,609 --> 02:01:04,772
I have children.

1715
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:09,659
Brother, I too have wife.

1716
02:01:09,738 --> 02:01:11,420
When did she come?
- Just now.

1717
02:01:11,501 --> 02:01:14,307
I saw a temple on the way..

1718
02:01:15,086 --> 02:01:16,382
Hey..

1719
02:01:16,462 --> 02:01:18,264
Okay, okay, come.
Bus will come.

1720
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:27,204
Father! Father! - Father, brother
is not coming to school. - Okay, okay.

1721
02:01:27,284 --> 02:01:29,788
You are telling lies.
Father, I am going.

1722
02:01:29,868 --> 02:01:32,210
Have you come?

1723
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,307
Useless fellow!

1724
02:01:34,387 --> 02:01:36,253
Where are you roaming?

1725
02:01:36,774 --> 02:01:39,498
If you don't give tablets
for my knee pain..

1726
02:01:39,578 --> 02:01:43,941
..I will take some tablets and die,
I am telling you. - Go away.

1727
02:01:44,136 --> 02:01:45,033
Good riddance!

1728
02:01:45,113 --> 02:01:49,228
What? Will you say like that to mother?
- I will say.

1729
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:52,395
Hey, elder boy.
Give the tablets from bottle.

1730
02:01:52,475 --> 02:01:54,449
Throw few on my face.

1731
02:01:54,655 --> 02:01:56,710
Take ten lakhs.
- Give. - Count.

1732
02:01:57,229 --> 02:02:00,601
Father! Father! Something happened
to grandmother, you come.

1733
02:02:00,681 --> 02:02:03,478
What happened?
- Don't know. You come, father.

1734
02:02:03,759 --> 02:02:04,862
Come.

1735
02:02:06,417 --> 02:02:07,693
Oh my goodness!

1736
02:02:08,569 --> 02:02:10,321
Hey! Hey!

1737
02:02:10,807 --> 02:02:12,256
What have you done?

1738
02:02:12,336 --> 02:02:16,137
I didn't do anything, father.
- I gave tablets from this box.

1739
02:02:25,931 --> 02:02:28,180
Do you know the value of
the box? One crore rupees.

1740
02:02:28,261 --> 02:02:30,473
One crore rupees?

1741
02:02:31,186 --> 02:02:32,472
One crore rupees!

02:02:37,445 --> 02:02:39,467
Mother, start.. start with children.

1743
02:02:39,547 --> 02:02:40,960
Where?
- To our village.

1744
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:42,667
Elder boy..

1745
02:02:42,747 --> 02:02:45,294
Anyway, your father will kill me..

1746
02:02:45,375 --> 02:02:47,587
..give one tablet
and do some good.

1747
02:02:47,667 --> 02:02:51,793
Grandmother, I am putting tablets
in this bag. Take whichever you like.

1748
02:02:52,073 --> 02:02:58,657
Guntur!

1749
02:03:28,514 --> 02:03:31,097
"Guntur Talkies!
Show has started, watch it."

1750
02:03:31,177 --> 02:03:33,800
"Guntur Talkies.
Whistle and sing."

1751
02:03:33,881 --> 02:03:36,471
"Guntur Talkies.
Buy the ticket."

1752
02:03:36,551 --> 02:03:39,142
"Guntur Talkies.

1753
02:03:39,221 --> 02:03:41,833
"Guntur Talkies.
Giri is too old."

1754
02:03:41,913 --> 02:03:44,460
"Guntur Talkies.
Hari is troublesome."

1755
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:47,087
"Guntur Talkies.
If they both become one.."

1756
02:03:47,167 --> 02:03:49,779
"Guntur Talkies.
Guntur Talkies."

1757
02:03:49,859 --> 02:03:52,416

"..is torturing by making a sketch."

1759
02:03:55,177 --> 02:03:57,498

1760
02:03:57,682 --> 02:04:00,461

"..by stealing everything they see.."

1764
02:04:08,498 --> 02:04:11,175
"..these rascals make their living."

1765
02:04:11,255 --> 02:04:13,769
"Forget the rules.."

1766
02:04:13,849 --> 02:04:16,418
"If you follow them
all then you will get nothing."

1767
02:04:16,497 --> 02:04:19,109
"If you steal wherever possible.."

1768
02:04:19,189 --> 02:04:21,585
"..bag is full."

1769
02:04:21,666 --> 02:04:24,440
