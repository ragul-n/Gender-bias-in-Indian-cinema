1
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Granny's all ancient
epic version of stories,

2
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,120
always ends protagonist
wins over the struggles.

3
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
Even those stories taught us
protagonist not to be defeated,

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,880
although how do a villain grow within us?

5
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,760
What could be the reason?

6
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,840
Did we ever thought about that?

7
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
Those who beat others
have a reason to tell,

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,720
those who get beaten up have
multiple reason to tell.

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,720
Those who watch these have
another reason to tell

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,120
Which one is true?

11
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,160
Not all the wars takes
place in battlefield.

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Not all the wars takes
place in battlefield.

13
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,520
There is a trust in Religion,
Humanity and Fear.

14
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,160
In-between the war for Love
and Hate, Dark and Shine,

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880
Which side are you?

16
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey, listen

17
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800

Okay!

23
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,600
Yes, I'll be there

24
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480

25
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,440

Let me finish breakfast

27
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
That's enough, Come

28
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,880
Come, I am getting late

29
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you troubling me, darling!

30
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Come fast

31
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,040
Okay, what time you will be

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,480
By 8pm, busy day!

33

Okay, I will also leave!

34
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,360
 Where are you leaving now?

35
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,120
I have to drop my sister

36
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,720
Ok, be careful, drive safely

37
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,400
Sure, shall we go out for a dinner?

38
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Call me at 2pm, I will confirm

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,040
Busy

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,520
Okay let me know, bye

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,480
Hey, something important!

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,640
- I love you
- I love you too!

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,320
(Song from Unnale Unnale)

45
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,720
Hey, Abbas!

46
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,120
Welcome sir,

47
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,360
Brother, where is that black
color bullet person stays?

48
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
He stays in 13th floor sir.

49
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
- Top?
- Yes

50
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,640
Okay, Thanks.

51
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,760
"My Friend, Abbas"

52
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,040
You?

53
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,480
Shocked?
You didn't expect me, right?

54
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,760
What's up here?

55
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,440
Nice place

56
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,600
While having cigarette,
I saw you crossing the coffee shop!

57
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,640
I found you with your bike color,

58
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,040
I was calling you, didn't you hear that?

59
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,040
Sorry bro, I was wearing
helmet and didn't hear you

60
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,960
You followed me from that far?

61
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,520
Yes bro, what else do you expect?

62
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
I was keep on calling you

63
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,280
But then you disappeared and
found you in the corner

64
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,360
It was very difficult to find you,
but then watchman helped me

65
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,360
Wow! Nice view

66
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,720
Are you staying alone?

67
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
Yeah, its a new complex,

68
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,080
Low rent and no one else
occupied yet in this block.

69
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,320
Nice place

70
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What else?

71
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,720
Where have you been?
What all you doing?

72
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,480
Nothing else man,
I traveled a lot and got bored

73
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,760
Now got back to computer business.

74
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,960
Again you started your own business?
You will never change!

75
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,760
That's what all I know!

76
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,680
What's up with you?

77
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
I completed Psychology

78
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,800
And going to London to pursue higher
studies in Criminal Psychology.

79
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,960
Congrats, I didn't expect that
you will be leaving India

80
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,640
I am not that interested to go,
but I will come back

81
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,880
When are you leaving?

82
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,600
Visa has arrived, course will begin in
a month, till then enjoying my time.

83
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,920
Do good, Don't spoil it.

84
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,200
Of course! I won't mess it up!

85
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,440
Definitely, you will mess it up

86
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,840
How are our boys doing?

87
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,040
They are all working in weekdays
and partying in weekends as usual.

88
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
Aren't you in touch with them?

89
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,480
No, not now!

90
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:25,280
Not an issue man,
Let's arrange a grand welcome party here!

91
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,080
What do you say?

92
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,200
No, not Interested.

93
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
Why not?

94
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,200
You inform the friends and girls
as usual my responsibility.

95
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay Let's celebrate as planned.

96
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
Have room in upstairs?

97
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
When are you planning to shift here?

98
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
In few days.

99
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,400
Okay let me know once you shift,
I will take care of the rest.

100
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,800
Come up man,
why are you standing there?

101
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,160
It's your house, right.

102
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,320
This is the best place to
enjoy the leisure time.

103
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,440
I am loving this place, Bro.

104
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,720
Nice place in city

105
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,840
Where did you disappeared,
it's been quite a long after we met.

106
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,400
Is it been 2 years since?

107
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,160
Yes, surely 2 years.

108
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,400
Everything is changed
and I was busy too.

109
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,160
Sorry, if you're busy,
I will come back later!

110
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,320
Little tired of night shift

111
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,440
It seems you're enjoying your night shift!

112
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
Come, let's sit.

113
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,880
Are you started reading Quran?

114
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,960
I got interested in learning.

115
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,800
I read it in childhood through my mom
and grandma, you knew that, right?

116
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,400
So do you believe in?

117
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,840
I believe in god as far as I read.

118
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,600
Good, you too following the right way.

119
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,840
I don't know much about that other
than smoking (taking cigarette)

120
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,360
Masood, I left all these habits.

121
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,400
Left? Since when?

122
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,040
Since 2 years

123
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,560
Are you serious?

124
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,600
- Do you want me to believe this?
- You too leave smoking, Masood.

125
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,240
Why are you talking like a monk?

126
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,640
You won't understand,
but don't smoke here.

127
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,760
Why bro, are you afraid of smoking again?

128
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,840
I am not afraid either, don't smoke here,
Please.

129
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,640
- Ok, I will smoke in the balcony
- No, don't have it in my house.

130
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,600
Just a minute man (lighting the cigarette),

131
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,680
NO (Shouting)

132
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,960
Hello, tell me, friend has came

133
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,600
No change in the plan
and I call you in 5 mins.

134
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
I will call you in 5 mins (repeat)

135
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,840
Abbas, what happen?
Any problem?

136
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,840
No, I got some work.
Don't mind, you have to leave.

137
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,520
- Let me know, I will help you out.
- You can't help me out.

138
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,760
- Then just take a puff,
0 No I don't need that (shouts)

139
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,840
- Why are you getting angry?
- Because of you only.

140
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,760
- What did I do?
- Nothing leave it.

141
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,640
What did I do?

142
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,040
I repeated not to smoke in my house

143
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,400
True, you told me.

144
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
But then why are you reacting like this?

145
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,400
Because you are insulting me at my house.

146
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I am your best friend and meeting you
after a long time, can't I just smoke?

147
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,400
You forget that you taught me all these

148
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
I wanted to forget my
past after seeing you.

149
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,200
- Are you feeling bad meeting me?
- Yes, my bad timing.

150
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,800
Don't waste my time, just leave.

151
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,280
Hell man

152
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,480
I shouldn't have came to meet you.

153
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,560
Just leave man.

154
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,000
Leaving now, Give me a call if you need me.

155
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Neither my number not
myself changed like you.

156
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,840
I should blame myself
for coming to meet him.

157
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,880
Time wasted

158
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,640
Greeting, sir

159
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,960

163
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,400

164
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,480
- I haven't seen you before.
- This is the first time I am coming here.

165
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,960
I knew all abbas's friend,
but I never seen you with them.

166
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,240
- Does he have friends?
- Yes sir.

167
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,080
 How long abbas staying here?

168
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,480
Since 5-6 months.

169
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,800
One min sir.

170
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,840
Hello

171
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,080
- Greetings! Masood here.
- Masood how are you?

172
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,120
Why are you staring at me?
I forget the key, look at yourself!

173
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,080
What you doing now?
waiting for you to tell your problems

174
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,080
See, I don't have any problem.
You may please leave.

175
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,680
I know you very well, just
open up your problems.

176
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,760
I didn't invite you to my house.

177
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,160
Just take the key and leave right now.

178
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,560
Don't lie to me.
I just spoke to watchman

179
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,200
He is telling that you are staying
here for six months.

180
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,640
Come with me! Is this is a kitchen?
Just water a bottle, nothing else?

181
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,840
Don't lie with me, come with me.

182
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,120
It doesn't looks like a
bedroom, all you have is

183
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,400
laptop, bag-pack and
suitcase in this apartment.

184
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,080
Don't you have anything
else in this apartment?

185
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,760
Please tell the truth.

186
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,520
What I do with my life is
none of your business.

187
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,800
Just disappear from here.

188
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,840
- I spoke to your mom,
- So?

189
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,640
She don't know
that you are here.

190
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,760
They are thinking you
are in Bangalore for 6 months

191
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,960
- I didn't inform mom about it.
- You didn't inform to your mom

192
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,320
What have you been doing without
informing mom for six months?

193
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,160
Masood, I am begging you,
please leave from here.

194
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,360
Friend, I understood your situation.

195
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,640
Don't pull my dad unnecessarily.

196
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,600
You changed a lot,
YES, I CHANGED WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

197
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,800
I understand, it was very
unfortunate incident.

198
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
 JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

199
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,360
Just forget the past and
forgive, Abbas

200
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,520
 Masood, I will beat you if
you insist me again.

201
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,480
I am your friend, I have to..

202
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:17,680
Do you want me to forget my Dad
was getting killed in front of me?

203
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:26,280
He pleaded to leave me
from there for my life.

204
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,080
He don't want me to see him getting killed
and pleaded them to take me away

205
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,200
So, what are you going to do in return?

206
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,560
- I am going to fix everything.
- How?

207
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,520
the only way to do is..
Abbas.. abbas.

208
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,000
What are you planning to do?

209
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,240
 That's none of your business,
just leave from here.

210
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,600
I am your best friend, I
will help you out in this.

211
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,120
 JUST GET OUT OF MY PLACE

212
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,280
I won't leave, what you could do?

213
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,880
Always will trouble to me because of you

214
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,520
You won't understand until I beat you dead.

215
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
Go ahead!

216
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,920
Hey abbas!

217
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,680
- Masood, Just Untie me
- Relax please.

218
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,240
- I will only after I know everything
- Everything is alright.

219
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,440
Just untie me, I am telling
you for your own goodness.

220
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,720
But, you are still angry

221
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,520
- But, you are still angry
- Yes, I know (Shouting)

222
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:29,080
I am psychologist and I know
how to deal with it.

223
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:35,120
I agree that I was angry,
just untie me now.

224
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,560
I will until you
answer my questions.

225
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,760
I am calm but I can't
answer to your questions

226
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,760
You won't understand my feelings.

227
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:57,120
- Feelings? what kind?
- Just untie me, masood (Shouts)

228
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,560
Abbas, you are very unstable now and
I worried about you at this situation

229
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,440
I calm only, but I am angry
because of you tied me here.

230
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,200
Look at yourself, you are
getting angry like a mad dog.

231
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,600
Don't lie to me Abbas,
tell me your problems!

232
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,240
The only problem right here
now is you, Masood.

233
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,040
Abbas, you still didn't forget
your father's death right?

234
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,480
That's not a death, it's murder.

235
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,200
You are right
It's murder

236
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,760
It's still disturbing
you, right?

237
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,680
Not just disturb, it's
troubling me to the core.

238
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,600
Abbas, why are you holding
like a mad person?

239
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,800
Just forget it all.

240
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,440
How will you react, if your father also
got killed the same way, Tell me?

241
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,200
It's easy to advise, but then how
are you going to feel my pain?

242
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,320
I understand and I can't
feel the pain you went through,

243
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,480
How that is possible?

244
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,200
They didn't even allow me
to turn and forced to watch...

245
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,320
...my father getting murdered
in front of my eyes.

246
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,520
That painful murder turned
me a violent person,

247
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:23,200
That helpless situation
brought me pain and angry.

248
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,960
He is a good person,
they deceptively killed him.

249
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,760
- Do you know my father?
- Yes, I know him.

250
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,080
They killed my father mercilessly!

251
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,640
- I understand your pain, abbas.
- They are the reason behind this pain.

252
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,960
This is not the end

253
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,160
They will suffer for
what they have done

254
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,120
- They will suffer
- How?

255
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,000
We have no idea about
them, then how?

256
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,200
 We will not able to understand
the way god show it to us.

257
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,920
- May I know who are you?
- My name is Yakhum.

258
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,600
I know what ever happened around you.

259
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,320
There are many around here like you

260
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I have a plan to cure your pain

261
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,880
 How?

262
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,200
If you need a peace, if you
need a meaning to your life,

263
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,280
if you need an answer for
whatever happened here.

264
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,520
Meet me tomorrow at the same place here.

265
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,000
I will be waiting here from 5 pm to 7 pm

266
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,280
You will find your answer for everything.

267
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,520
After that situation
you disappeared

268
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,840
Yes, I went somewhere, because
I had no other idea.

269
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,640
I want to be alone so I went somewhere
and no one tried finding me.

270
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,480
But I tried.

271
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,520
I try finding you for so many months,
but you are not interested to meet anyone.

272
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,520
Look Masood, you are right about me.

273
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,040
I have changed myself a lot,
I am not your old friend.

274
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,160
- Welcome, I know you will come.
- I didn't know any other way

275
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,360
- He has came.
- Send him inside.

276
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,680
- Send him alone.
- Sure.

277
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:18,280
Abbas, Young man. I heard your sad story.

278
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,080
They killed my father.

279
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,360
They are ruthless people
They don't believe in God.

280
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,080
I am going to decide only after
I ask you a five question.

281
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,400
- Sure, ask me.
- Sit

282
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,680
I changed, I am not a old Abbas.
I got a new purpose in life and purpose.

283
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,280
What you meant by new life and purpose?

284
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:56,120
Yes, what is the difficult to understand?
wait, what was that? taking revenge?

285
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,320
- I need an answer
- That's up-to god to decide not you.

286
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,320
It is my responsibility to take revenge
for my father's murder.

287
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,680
Whom are you going to take a revenge?
Do you know who all they?

288
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,320
They are all politicians
goons, they work for money.

289
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,720
Someone has to answer them back

290
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,240
But what you are going to do?
Revenge? (sighs)

291
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,280
I am not going to do anything,
just untie me now, Masood.

292
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,600
- What's in the box?
- Why do you want to know?

293
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,840
- I am asking you, tell me?
- Nothing in that

294
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,560
Then why have you locked this?

295
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,240
Masood, I am warning you, untie me now.

296
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,640
- Hey, is it a new laptop, Dell?
- Don't smoke here. Chill, you won't die.

297
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,200
Can I check?

298
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,160
No, you shouldn't.

299
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,240
Why?

300
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,960
Because, it is my private information
and very personal to me.

301
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,360
Oh! private information, right? sorry.

302
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
but, you are behaving like
a psycho and you tried

303
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,640
to kill me, now you afraid
of checking your laptop.

304
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,560
No Masood, I am begging you not
to open the laptop, please.

305
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,320
Begging me for what?

306
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,040
Because it is my private
information, very personal to me.

307
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,440
Oh okay, are you a gay?
Afraid of checking that?

308
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,200
- Don't worry, I won't reveal it anyone.
- Don't you have sense?

309
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,840
So, you have a problem
checking your laptop?

310
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,480
 Masood NO!

311
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,520
Listen to me, please.

312
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,000
Everything will change if
you switch ON the laptop.

313
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,560
- Is that so?
- YES.

314
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,000
Hell, Psycho man!
SHIT!

315
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,360
No, don't do that.
You will die for sure.

316
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,840
Shit! what is this all? (shouts)

317
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:43,320
Abbas, what have you done?
What is this all about?

318
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,680
- Hello! yeah tell me
- Where are you?

319
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,240
- What's the time now?
- It's 1pm. take a cab and leave home.

320
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,440
I have been waiting for an hour
and you are telling me now?

321
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,560
 Sorry, I got some
important work.

322
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,720
Okay, Where are you?

323
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,600
 I am at my friend place, there is
some issue, will tell you later.

324
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,680
Very important friend,
understand me please.

325
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,800
Who is that friend?

326
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,920
You don't know about him, aleesha.
call me when you reach home.

327
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,920
- Sure
- Bye

328
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,760
I want to go to bathroom

329
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,680
- You may go
- You have to untie me for that!

330
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,200
I will, but answer to my questions!

331
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,400
I am warning you, untie me now.
Else, I will kill you.

332
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,120
You have no idea where
you are messing it up!

333
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,400
I got to know about you,
when you tried to kill me.

334
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,240
but after seeing this all,
I didn't know who you are!

335
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,360
You are not an old Abbas, you
are such psycho man now.

336
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,040
Yes, I am.

337
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,400
Yes I got mad, because of them.

338
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,880
It's been two years but it is still in
my eyes, I can't forget this.

339
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,760
I can still feel and smell the
pain of my father's death.

340
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,560
I can neither forget or forgive
whatever they did to me and my family.

341
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,760
Anyhow, I have to take a revenge,
whom are you going to punish?

342
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,440
Are you going to punish
innocent people and kids?

343
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,640
- There is no meaning doing that
- You can't understand!

344
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,560
There is nothing to understand,
you're going to kill innocent

345
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,880
people that's wrong and nothing
much to think about it!

346
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,480
This is God's order to clean
out the dirt's in this world

347
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,280
Why are you talking like this?
Who motivated you to commit this?

348
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,680
Who are you to clean
out this dirt?

349
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,360
Why god have to choose you to do this?
Tell me!

350
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,280
We are all aware about the
crimes happening here!

351
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,680
They are killing all my
brothers and sisters!

352
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,400
They are aiming us and making us culprit.

353
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,360
They are destroying us!

354
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,400
Have you ever thought about
why this is happening?

355
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,720
Because of some psycho like you
taking violence to change the world.

356
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,800
That's the reason why all Muslim's getting
bad name because of people like you.

357
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,640
We are the real Muslim's!

358
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,240
- Real Muslim's you? Idiot!
- Idiot?

359
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,960
What is being idiot?

360
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Millions of Musilm's are
getting killed for no reason?

361
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,080
What about the crimes
happening in middle east?

362
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,240
Millions of children died due to lack of
food, water, place and medicine?

363
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,640
Who will take the
responsibility for all these?

364
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,200
You're educated person, right?
just think about it.

365
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,640
All the powerful countries
desired to rule the world.

366
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,680
Due to this desire, crave,
War happens and destroy everything.

367
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,640
After some days, they destruct everything
and then next country then next and so on..

368
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,520
It's been running for a
while, Check the history,

369
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,240
every country, every people,
Persians, Greek, Romans,

370
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,840
Germans, British, Japanese, French

371
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,720
Everyone has desired to
rule the world at one stage

372
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,520
Now it is belongs to rich people's desire.

373
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,640
and you are been paid for their desires.

374
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,520
But the difference is, Rich people
are heroes and you are villains.

375
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,560
Don't talk Masood without knowledge!

376
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,080
Just get lost, Idiot!

377
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,480
I feel bad for Maria

378
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,720
But your angry, male ego. violence

379
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,840
is not the right reason,
for god sending you to clean the dirt's!

380
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,640
This thinking makes me angry!

381
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,760
Do you think god will allow
to kill innocent people?

382
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,200
I have a place prepared in heaven

383
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,600
Heaven? How many people
are standing up like you?

384
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,600
Ah?

385
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,960
Have you done all these or planned to do?

386
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,120
Not yet!

387
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,080
I was just looking at it

388
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,760
I have prepared the list to
do all, have you bought it?

389
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,400
 No, not yet

390
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,280
Okay where is the detailed plan?
how are you going to execute?

391
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,440
New city cinemas?

392
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,600
Abbas
Are you actually going to do this?

393
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,720
Who is helping you in this?

394
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,200
See, no one helping me in this.
I get angry at sometimes!

395
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,200
That's it! In turn of furious,
I plan all these, just a plan!

396
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,000
I am not going to execute, trust me!
I am not a terrorist, Masood!

397

516
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,920
You are going to stay here only!

517
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,440
I will pick you up in the evening!

518
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,320
Where are we leaving?

519
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,080
To meet the bomber!

520
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,720
Mr.abbas?

521
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,920
- Yes,
- Ismail sent me here!

522
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,200
- You?
- I am Neelufa

523
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,040
Girl?
Why didn't you tell me that!

524
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,720
- I didn't think it is important
- IT IS!

525
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,280
Waist is large, won't fit!

526
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,600
Can you able to manage?

527
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,680
- Yes
- Ok come, will see!

528
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,360
Who's that girl?
Where she come from?

529
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,320
She is from Mumbai!

530
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,960
She lost her parents in childhood,
she was saved by her neighbors!

531
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,960
But no one survived from her family!

532
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,320
Whole family?

533
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,880
Total 7 members!

534
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,600
Who is he?

535
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,080
- Long time friend,
- How did he got to know your place?

536
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,160
He followed me from the roadside!

537
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,360
Tie him first!

538
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,760
What should we do with him?

539
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,080
We can't leave him freely,
he know our plans!

540
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,400
So, will finish him here!

541
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,960
- Not now, Is camera ready?
- Yes!

542
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,680
Keep the black cloth over the window,
no one should see it from outside!

543
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,160
- Hope there is no change in our plan.
- No Change!

544
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,160
Hey!

545
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,560
Where to setup?

546
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,080
Set it up here, lighting is good!

547
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,880
What about him?

548
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,600
Come

549
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,120
Zak, can you start?

550
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,080
I will speak later, I am not prepared yet!

551
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,440
- Haven't you prepared yet?
- I will prepare in some time!

552
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,440
- Ok, who is ready?
- I will start!

553
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,960
You got only 30 seconds!

554
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,200
Ready, Roll Camera.

555
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,200
Rolling, action!

556
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,320
To all the Muslim friends around the world,

557
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,600
My dear brothers and sisters,

558
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,160
I am doing this for you all!

559
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,120
I am going to be a warrior!

560
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,720
For the only real God, Allah!

561
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,360
I am going to kill those
who don't believe in Allah!

562
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,120
Friends, when you see this,
I will be in Heaven!

563
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,960
My death will be for allah!

564
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:35,040
I am pleased about what I am going to do!

565
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,200
In few mins, I will be going to Heaven!

566
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,600
Cut!

567
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,400
Just shut your mouth!

568
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,920
Hey!

569
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,920
You're all going to die and
going to heaven, right?

570
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,000
Do you think god will accept this?

571
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,680
You're all going to die in Hell!

572
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,920
Life long...

573
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,280
Close his mouth!

574
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,680
Come, let's complete this!

575
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,600
Are you going to start from the
beginning or from the end?

576
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,480
Just do last 3 lines, will edit it.

577
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,520
Roll Camera, Rolling, Action!

578
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,960
To all the Muslims brothers and sisters

579
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,360
(Praying)

580
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,480
(Reading Quran)

581
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:31,440
(Prayer continuous)

582
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,280
Just killing in the name of
Allah, You can't be a Muslim!

583
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,840
Do you know the meaning!

584
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:49,000
Killing innocent people is
equal to killing entire people!

585
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,440
God will never forgive your act!

586
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,360
- You're all going to die in heaven
- Shut his mouth!

587
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,800
Life long

588
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:09,200
You guys never understand the impact,
you idiots!

589
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,320
- This is for my mom.
- I will hand over!

590
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,400
When they get to know
about my death, there

591
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,560
should be someone to
take care of them!

592
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,360
I will be there for your family,
my job is completed!

593
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,440
Only one thing is left,

594
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,920
Everything is going as per plan,
you no need to worry about anything!

595
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,640
Insha allah!
(If allah wills it)

596
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,080
Everything went well!

597
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,880
After finishing the task, I will take
your name to the higher people!

598
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,720
Kill as many people as possible!

599
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,000
Surely, everything happen as per the plan!

600
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:56,040
as we discussed, keep our people in the
exit doors! that's very important!

601
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,160
We need to explode the main
door with the Car that

602
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,680
will block the main door,
then will lock the people!

603
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,920
In that way, people get trapped inside.

604
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,120
Everyone know what they have to do!

605
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,840
Plan will be successfully executed!

606
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,520
God is with you, abbas!

607
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,400
You're savior!

608
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,200
being with you each moment
is a proud moment!

609
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,240
Just wait a min!

610
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,280
- Came here for a trail
- Come inside!

611
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,120
- It's ready, just left with lock!
- Locks?

612
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,880
Yeah, small locks to lock permanently!

613
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,760
That's not needed!

614
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,000
Do you want to try?

615
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,160
Okay, we will wait outside!

616
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,880
What happen?

617
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,800
- She is too young
- That's her decision!

618
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,960
I know that!

619
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,160
But, I am not able to understand,
What you didn't understand?

620
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,040
Tomorrow is her last day!

621
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,880
But she is not worried about that!

622
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,640
Not everyone is interested
in leading the life!

623
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,600
Everyone is expecting death!

624
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,720
I am feeling sad for her!

625
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,400
This is Jihad, abbas!

626
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,960
You won't get anything else
to feel proud of your death!

627
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,080
Don't get attached to her,
you have to see many like her!

628
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,880
- When this is going to happen?
- Day after tomorrow!

629
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,720
- Where?
- In Chennai!

630
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,880
Come out!

631
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,840
- Why sir?
- Security check, please co-operate!

632
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,040
Get down!

633
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,280
Hello sir, as you instructed,
we have caught four of them!

634
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,600
Among them one has beard!

635
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,240
- I am coming
- Ok, you reached!

636
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,280
Sir, these all the people, confirmed it.

637
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,880
Take him, Ok Sir!

638
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,240
Cut him!

639
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,160
Sir, look at here now!

640
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,360
Abdul Hameed!
Your time is bad

641
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,600
Do your job
Finish him

642
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,680
Make it faster!

643
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,200
Get inside the jeep, take everyone inside!

644
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,600
Go inside, Go!

645
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,760
Ready, Fire!

646
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,720
(Gun shots)

647
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:39,880
(news reading - English)

648
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,040
(news reading continuous)

649
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,040
There is no other way except encounter!

650
01:09:47,080 --> 01:10:02,320
(news reader, continuous - English)

651
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:07,480
(news reader questioning  inspector)

652
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,720
Abdul hameed is most wanted
terrorist in our department!

653
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,080
as per the information,
when we went to nab them,

654
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,440
they shot our police personal to escape,
so we fired back them!

655
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,320
due to that abdul hameed and
all other terrorists were killed!

656
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,080
they planned to keep the bomb in Chennai.

657
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:30,040
so we are happy that we
stopped the bomb blast!

658
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:37,400
(News reading continues)

659
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,520
(door bell rings)

660
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,480
(door bell rings)

661
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,440
What you doing?

662
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,080
- Why to waste?
- What's your plan then

663
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,880
Sit

664
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,160
Very simple!

665
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,760
Zack, bring the mob!

666
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,080
Lock him in the next room!

667
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,680
Clean the floor,
ismail, check his car!

668
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,200
Did you change the names in license?

669
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,200
We should switch on bomb

670
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,160
Not now

671
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,320
Will do before departure from here

672
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,720
Irfan, keep in mind to keep
it in the parking slot!

673
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,640
Don't park in any other place

674
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:58,520
- Don't worry Abbas
- There  will be a blood all over!

675
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,240
This is God order

676
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,400
Insha Alla
(If Allah wills it)

677
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:17,400
(Prayer)

678
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,720
Stop the jeep!

679
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,400
Check that out, okay sir!

680
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,280
Do you remember what he said?

681
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,520
What he said?

682
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,800
We are doing Sin and
we will be die in Hell!

683
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,720
Who cares about what he said!

684
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,440
No Ismail, I guess we
are taking a big risk!

685
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,520
- What if he is true?
- Which one?

686
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:06,480
God's wish is..
I don't know I am confused!

687
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:13,640
May be we are wrong!

688
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,800
What do you think?
Are we doing wrong or right?

689
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,200
I don't know Ismail,
I don't know!

690
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I am still confused

691
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,120
 You Idiot!
Are you backing yourself?

692
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,120
- Don't trust him, Ismail
- You knew all these before in, right?

693
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:43,360
I know Ismail, but I feel right then
but now I am afraid, let me go!

694
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,920
Nothing you could do now!

695
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,560
I need to rethink,
I need to pray in mosque

696
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,720
Zak
Let me leave!

697
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,520
Where you go?
Please stop

698
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,920
I have to go, Ismail!

699
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,560
I felt right in the beginning,
but now I am afraid!

700
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,520
There is nothing feel proud about it.
let me go, leave me!

701
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,400
Zak, this is not just fear,
it's an excitement!

702
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,520
I too feel the same

703
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
We are going to serve god

704
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,800
I too feel the excitement, danger
and everything!

705
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,520
Don't get confused, don't be afraid!

706
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,680
What if we are all wrong?

707
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,280
No Zak, this is not wrong!
We are God's servant!

708
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,880
We have to do this,
come with me!

709
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:51,000
We will get our benefit soon,
we both reach heaven together!

710
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,160
We will be together but not sure in heaven!

711
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,080
Ismail, what happen?

712
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,840
He woke up, just made him sleep!

713
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,120
Will he awake again?

714
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,280
- No not immediately
- Ok I will send Jaleen

715
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,760
Not needed!

716
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:23,680
Ismail, just wait here and then
come upstairs we need to check the waist!

717
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,360
- A small issue
- What?

718
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,960
Zak is afraid and thinking to step back!

719
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,200
Did he say anything?

720
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:53,520
He thinks we are all doing wrong and
going with Masood's words!

721
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:08,960
'You and me are
one and the same"

722
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:17,680
"The day we join is not afar"

723
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,000
"You and me are
one and the same"

724
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:45,840
"Recover from your plight"

725
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:52,399
"This situation will change"

726
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:58,560
"The mission to rescue you.."

727
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,040
"..has started"

728
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:16,760
"The wounds will vanish
like the passing clouds"

729
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:29,840
"Looking forward to green pasture
in the days to come"

730
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:36,120
"Hopefully, one day
it will be gleeful.."

731
01:23:36,143 --> 01:23:39,903
"..to all of us"

732
01:23:42,839 --> 01:23:48,599
"Have faith like the roots of plants"

733
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:53,920
"Arise, O man..."

734
01:24:20,143 --> 01:24:31,971
"Let us reform to make
this world anew with love"

735
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:42,375
"Let the kindness drizzle
and spread in our hearts"

736
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:56,801
"Let us sow happiness
Plesantries will sprout"

737
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,560
"No need of wars"

738
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:16,800
"Join hands to bend the rules"

739
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:40,360
'You and me are
one and the same"

740
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:54,320
"The day we join is not afar"

741
01:25:54,680 --> 01:26:05,000
'You and me are
one and the same"

742
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:19,120
"The day we join is not afar"

743
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:28,520
'You and me are
one and the same"

744
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,640
What you reap, you will sow!

745
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,440
- I just did my job
- I too did my job only

746
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:10,720
Boys, you all get caught and
you will die do if you can!

747
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,360
If you can do it

748
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:18,440
You're all shameless creature,
the only way to deal with you is...

749
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,160
How?

750
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:25,160
- By having fake encounter?
- Yes, if needed!

751
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,960
Best of luck!

752
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,480
Don't imagine, it will happen
as per your wish!

753
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,240
What all you want?

754
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,440
I don't know what are you going to achieve.
That you won't know!

755
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,440
You have no idea
were you're leading!

756
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,840
- All I wanted to know only one thing.
- What?

757
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,160
How did you got to know
about abdul hameed's route?

758
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:57,600
We are police and
we knew everything!

759
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,960
But you didn't expect
getting caught, right?

760
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,760
No one can escape from here!

761
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,280
You're all going to get
caught and killed.

762
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,840
Yes we knew and we
are prepared to die!

763
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:15,200
- But you wanted to live, right?
- I know I am going to die!

764
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,760
- Am I fool?
- Good, got it

765
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:37,600
- Wait a min, I have to pray!
- Okay make it quick, ismail make him free!

766
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,640
(bomb exploded)

767
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,800
Are you all ready?,
Yes we are ready!

768
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,800
What about Zak?

769
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:11,560
I wanted to give a second
thought, abbas.

770
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,680
Wait
I will manage him

771
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:57,880
Zak, what happen?
Tell me why are you worried?

772
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:06,720
I am afraid abbas.
I am afraid of going to Hell!

773
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:20,200
We won't go to Hell, don't be afraid.
I can't do this abbas, leave me!

774
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:26,040
You to be strong and do it this anyhow,
I know that!

775
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:38,880
This is not right abbas, I can't do this
Think again, we have no choice!

776
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:45,960
What if everyone leave this mission?

777
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:55,640
You knew well, you're afraid.
They are innocent people!

778
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,840
Even our people were innocents,
but they got killed too!

779
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,520
I can't argue with you
and I can't do this!

780
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:13,560
who won't be afraid of death?
I am not afraid of death but hell!

781
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,200
He changed your mind, right?

782
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:31,480
Yes, I thank god for that!
So you are determined?

783
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:39,600
Sorry abbas, I can't do this! please!

784
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:45,200
What you have to do,
you knew it very well!

785
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:52,960
No abbas, leave me, I will go
away, just leave me, please!

786
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:14,720
No No, leave me leave me, please!

Abbas, tell them to leave me!

790
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,800
Abbas, tell them to leave me!

791
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:06,640
Ismail Ismail! No, please!

792
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Shall we kill him as well?
No, I will take care of him!

793
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,120
It's yours

794
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,720
Change the dress and come!

795
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,280
Change carefully!

796
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,000
We will be leaving in some time!

797
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:12,720
Do your duty diligently, do it on time.
we are God's children! Let's go!

798
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:22,200
Let's fulfill God's Wish
This is not what God wished!

799
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:41,320
This is not God's wish, if that so,
you could have win.

800
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,880
but that won't happen.
I am sure about it!

801
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,840
If you come closer, I
will explode the bomb!

802
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,880
Masood, listen to me,

803
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:56,720
Just shut your mouth!

804
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:12,120
Abbas, he won't do it! he is coward!
Do you think so? come closer! NO!

805
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:19,840
Masood, listen to me carefully.
Think about your family!

806
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,600
I am thinking about them
only (crying)

807
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:32,760
you have to fulfill your life, you
wanted to go England, right?

808
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:53,480
Masood, you can live as you wanted,
just handover the detonator and leave!

809
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,840
After that, what you going to do?

810
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,520
What I wanted to do
that I will do

811
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,640
What you would like to do, just
go ahead with that!

812
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:06,880
So if I leave your house, I won't
be facing any trouble, right?

813
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:09,160
Yes, trust me!

814
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,440
How can I trust murderer,

815
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,520
Your guys killed me

816
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:22,040
Masood, trust me nothing will happen
to you, just handover the detonator!

817
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,000
I hope you

818
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,760
So those innocent people?
That's their fate!

819
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:37,840
I will change their fate if I wish too!

820
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:43,360
What other options you have?
No other options None!

821
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,720
you have masood! you
just leave and continue

822
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,480
with it just handover the
detonator and leave!

823
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:01,520
Don't you have heart?

824
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:08,000
We are strong enough
to take the revenge for my father's murder!

825
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,640
Then it shouldn't by with
taking life of innocent people!

826
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:24,960
Masood, listen to me! I won't, I saw how did
you killed Zak. you're not at all humans!

827
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,360
Masood you better leave

828
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:33,920
It will be good, I too wish the same!

829
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:45,000
There is only one way to come out
of this and you knew it very well!

830
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:51,280
Masood, No! Abbas, he won't do it.
He is coward!

831
01:41:54,920 --> 01:42:00,760
(praying)

832
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,760
Listen to me!

833
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,520
Abbas, kill him!

834
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:19,160
New terrorists, right? how did we miss them?
we don't know how we missed this time!

835
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,960
Any leads?

836
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,600
we were able to identify only
one body from the crime spot

837
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:31,040
We are not able to
identify other three bodies!

838
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:36,720
Did you investigate CCTV records?
what about hotels, shops?

839
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,960
Cell phone towers
for call recordings?

840
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:41,840
No we didn't get any evidence.

841
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:45,800
The one you identified,
his name is Masood.

842
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,720
We have called his mother
and sister for inquiry!

843
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,720
- Are they inside?
- Yes, sir.

844
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,680
- What's this?
- Masood's forensic report!

845
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,120
- Masood?
- Yes sir

846
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,440
Do you know why did we invite you?

847
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:20,320
 No, but whatever we
know we have told them.

848
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:24,440
He is DCP Vikraman from NIA.
He will ask few questions.

849
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:31,960
Did Masood went on a
long vacation somewhere?

850
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,280
 No Sir, he is just committed
to work and house.

851
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:43,080
Abroad or something?
Yes only once to England.

852
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:47,080
Oh, so what about visa
papers and documents?

853
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,520
Everything was ready and he
was excited about going there!

854
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:58,280
we were planning for a marriage
after he come back from England.

855
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,080
That's when he was about
to pick up his sister.

856
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:04,960
Sir, we have told everything and
we don't know anything else.

857
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,840
Please don't waste time on us.

858
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,920
Alright, but you have to co-operate
until investigation get over.

859
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:17,760
- He has connection in that, he's so innocent
- Then, you need not worry.

860
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,760
Truth will come out when
the investigation gets over!

861
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:26,560
We want justice for my son,

862
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,000
if your son is innocent,
his name will be removed.

863
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,200
What happened in the
apartment, that we didn't know

864
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,920
but I am sure Masood
is not a terrorist.

865
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,360
Did you check london, visa
and all the documents?

866
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:54,080
yes we did verify
and inquired too!

867
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,960
Should I tell what could have happened?

868
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,000
They made a bomb and
it exploded accidentally

869
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,720
but then how they get killed
with their own bombs?

870
01:46:05,775 --> 01:46:07,375
IED is risky business.

871
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,781
Then what about Masood?

872
01:46:09,922 --> 01:46:14,782
We can't neither believe what the girl told
nor decide Masood's role from the incident

873
01:46:14,829 --> 01:46:17,000
- Do you think he is innocent?
- I don't know

874
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:22,760
It's good, they killed them self.
Else it could be a trouble for us.

875
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,960
Why are they doing like this?
Who are they? What's their objective?

876
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:33,520
Iqbal, I have seen them
and read about them.

877
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:38,520
They them self think they are disturbed and
the revenge is the only motive for them.

878
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,640
Muslim religion gets bad reputation,
because of these acts!

879
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:46,800
- Is this is going to continue?
- It's a cycle!

880
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,560
- Is there any solution?
- I don't know!

881
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,400
We just keep on discuss this,
get me forensic reports.

882
01:46:54,574 --> 01:47:00,715
"The doors will open
on its own for us"

883
01:47:00,799 --> 01:47:06,628
"The sun vanishes daily
faraway to reappear.."

884
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,277
Not all wars
happen in the battlefield

885
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:14,623
There is a trust in Religion,
Humanity, Fear, Faith

886
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:18,960
In-between the war for Love
and Hate, Dark and Shine,

887
01:47:19,618 --> 01:47:21,758
Which side are you?
