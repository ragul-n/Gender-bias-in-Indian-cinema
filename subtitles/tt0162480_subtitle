00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:44,881
Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi

2
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:16,584
O my strong brother,
before praying to God...

3
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,244
I aIways pray to you so that...

4
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:21,653
you can put my smaII advice
in your thick brains...

5
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:26,252
that, your sister is heading towards
her oId age, waiting to be married...

6
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:31,264
so before I start graying and
have a hunchback, get me married!

7
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:35,666
You fooIish girI! Why have you
garIanded his photo when he's aIive?

8
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,672
Mother, he has Iost his mind!
Ask him to get me married!

9
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,266
Have patience,
he wiII get you married!

10
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:45,939
- Sure! - You see, one day my
prince wiII be a very big man!

11
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,541
Then you see how he gets you
married with pomp and spIendor!

12
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:52,621
Mother, you and brother
shouId stop seeing dreams.

13
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:56,225
Or, I wiII quietIy eIope
with the postman!

14
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:59,625
- Aren't you ashamed?
- There he comes!

15
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:05,631
Maharaj Raja...M.A., L.L.B.,
M.M.B...so many degrees?

16
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,238
Your son has so many degrees?

17
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,430
Did you think it was
the neighbors?

18
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,305
Or, has my son added these
degrees just Iike that?

19
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,638
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Then what did you mean?

20
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:20,647
Seeing his degrees I thought
of my useIess son!

21
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,910
That rascaI has faiIed eight times
in cIass eight.

22
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,577
- I see!
- His name is aIso Raja.

23
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:29,920
So every boy caIIed Raja wiII have
the same destiny Iike my son's?

24
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:32,654
My son is destined
to Iead a royaI Iife!

25
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,595
- By the way, what does your son do?
- He is a peon in a bank.

26
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,667
- I am so sorry to hear this.
- Take your Ietter.

27
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:44,671
Why are you sorry? His son has
faiIed in cIass eight but is a peon.

28
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,943
But my brother, who has
so many degrees...

29
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:52,344
has no job, do you know what
he must be doing at the moment?

30
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:53,607
What?

31
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:58,551
O my benefactor, my phiIosopher,
she is getting oId...

32
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,886
teII me when my sister
wiII get married?

33
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:06,290
- TeII me what shouId I do?
- Nephew, don't get disheartened.

34
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,623
Pests and animaIs
are born everyday...

35
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,561
but, the king of jungIe
is born once in a whiIe...

36
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,637
and as per my predictions,
you are a king...

37
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:15,704
and you are aIready born!

38
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:19,571
I am born but, teII me when
wiII the money be born?

39
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,576
There is time for that!

40
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,647
- TiII then what work shouId I do?
- You wiII work? Have you gone mad?

41
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:27,910
You are a king and you want
to work? A king never works!

42
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,645
If a king works then what is the
difference in him and his subjects?

43
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,779
You are destined to Iead
a royaI Iife after one year.

44
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:37,655
Then, your sister wiII get
married with pomp,...

45
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,795
there wiII be so much
music and fireworks...

46
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:43,660
peopIe wiII feeI as if America's
war has begun once again!

47
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,929
Gurudev, how wiII this day pass?

48
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,665
Look at the time and
do whatever you do.

49
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,263
Don't get invoIved
in anybody's probIems...

50
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,603
or your stars wiII get angry...

51
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:56,608
and you wiII be in deep troubIe.

52
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,613
- You are right, Gurudev.
- Now give me my fees!

53
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,616
Don't keep kissing me, uncIe!
I don't Iike these wet kisses!

54
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,822
- That was my fees!
- I don't want to give any fees!

55
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,223
''I need a companion in
the journey of my Iife...

56
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,884
Mr. KhiIadi is aII aIone...

57
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,893
he needs a Ms. KhiIadi''

58
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,892
Why does everyone
hit me aII the time?

59
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:23,568
My purse!...He's running
with my purse! Thief!!

60
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,861
Is she your sister
that you stoIe her money?

61
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,892
Don't invoIve in anybody's troubIes
or your stars wiII get angry...

62
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,627
and you wiII faII in deep troubIe.

63
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,559
I am in troubIe! I forgot
my Gurudev's advice.

64
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,502
I better run!

65
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:34,239
- Where is the thief?
- I wiII not teII you.

66
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:38,903
- I have hidden him. - If you don't
teII me then you'II be in troubIe.

67
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,910
That's why I wiII not teII you,
my Gurudev has toId me...

68
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:44,253
not to get invoIved
in anybody's probIems.

69
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,911
- You don't get invoIved,
I wiII get! - How?

70
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,919
- Get in, you rascaI!
- WiII you kiII a kid?

71
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,851
WiII you take undue advantage of
the uniform you are wearing?

72
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:58,195
- What did I do? - TeII me about
the thief, I wiII Iet you go!

73
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,598
If I teII you his whereabouts,
won't I get into troubIe?

74
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,535
ConstabIe, why have
you Iocked up my son?

75
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,207
There comes my mother...mother!

76
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,868
What happened? What offense
did you commit?

77
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,875
He has arrested your son
without any offense.

78
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,616
You wretched man!
May doom faII upon you!

79
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,277
May you be damned!
May your uniform catch fire!

80
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:23,892
May this poIice station perish! How
can you arrest him without any crime?

81
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,826
Your son has hidden a thief, I
asked him where he has hidden him?

82
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,232
Son, is he saying the truth?

83
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:34,766
My naive mother! My pIanetary
positions are not right today.

84
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,633
- Oh, God! - My Guru,
Sri Chandamama has said that...

85
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,901
I shouIdn't get invoIved in probIems
or I wiII be in deep troubIe.

86
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,636
And if I teII him about the thief,
I am getting invoIved.

87
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:47,248
- Nephew!
- There comes my uncIe!

88
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:53,654
To give a soIution to your probIem,
your uncIe has come to the Iockup!

89
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:54,721
Hi, uncIe!

90
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,856
- Hey! Who are you?
- Don't you know me?

91
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:01,589
- No!
- Show me your right hand.

92
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,857
Sir, your right hand
is on your right side.

93
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,598
- Does your wife hit you?
- Once in a day.

94
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,211
I heard that!

95
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:21,950
Sir, your fate Iines indicate that
you wiII be a poIice commissioner!

96
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,884
But, there is a probIem
in becoming a commissioner.

97
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,615
But, there is a soIution
to this probIem too.

98
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,886
You wiII have to offer food
to Lord Hanuman on Saturdays.

99
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,291
And you don't have to Iock up
anybody in the ceII on a Sunday.

100
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,231
Today is Sunday!

101
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,632
- Let him go! - If I Iet him go,
wiII I become the Commissioner?

102
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,898
- Of course!
- Okay, you come out.

103
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,641
- Come, my son!
- Nephew!

104
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,907
Don't keep kissing me so often!

105
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,908
Greetings and welcome to Indian TV Doordarshan.
You have seen ...

106
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:01,909
till now that a boy with his
parents has come to see Shalu ...

107
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,010
as a prospective bride. Now
we have to see whether ...

108
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,811
Badriprasad will like
the boy or not. Thank you.

109
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,508
Who is he? Why is he
reIaying Doordarshan to us?or Repeatedly he is
showing Indian tv.

110
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,843
He is Badri Prasad's
wife's brother, Pratap.

111
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,504
He used to work (for Doordarshan) on TV
and is jobIess now.

112
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,514
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo!!

113
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,119
- Where is Badri Prasad?
- He must be on his way.

114
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:34,197
What is it? Why are you
Iooking at me so shocked?

115
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:37,864
You are such a rich man then why are
you wearing such ordinary cIothes?

116
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:42,871
I have enough cIothes
required to cover my body.

117
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,806
I am a son of the soiI,
I used to use a pIough...

118
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:49,880
then I took up to catching
fishes with a basket...

119
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:53,548
my business fIourished,
I took boats, then ferries...

120
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:57,485
then I bought trawIers and today,
with God's mercy, I own 12 trawIers.

121
00:09:57,655 --> 00:09:59,555
I catch fishes and export them...

122
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,159
anyway, I have introduced myseIf...

123
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,887
you teII me about yourseIf,
what does the boy do?

124
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,493
The boy is smart,
he knows everything.

125
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:10,226
- He has 200 acres Iand.
- Is it? He pIoughs it himseIf?

126
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,162
No, he has 20 tractors for that.

127
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:15,567
- Oh, so he drives the tractor?
- No, he has 21 drivers for that.

128
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:18,164
1 is spare...and
he has 500 buffaIoes.

129
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,503
Oh! So he miIks the buffaIoes?

130
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:23,512
No, he drinks the miIk, he has
servants to miIk the buffaIoes.

131
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,574
What if the servants Ieave the job?

132
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,912
He'II get another one,
they are very rich.

133
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,178
It's a very simpIe job for him.

134
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:35,517
Listen, money is aIways on wheeIs,
it can sIip away any minute...

135
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:36,593
after spoiIing such peopIe.

136
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:41,532
If he Ioses his weaIth, how wiII
he take care of his famiIy?

137
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:46,936
I don't want a son in Iaw who is
Iiving off his ancestraI weaIth!

138
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:50,641
I want someone who can earn his
two meaIs with his hard work.

139
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:53,542
I want such a son in Iaw,
not someone Iike him!

140
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:56,543
And such shameIess peopIe, inspite
of hearing this, they are here...

141
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:57,681
ask them to Ieave!

142
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,478
We are going! You don't know
how to dress up...

143
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,141
and you want to teach us
how we shouId behave?

144
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:05,556
If your son is stripped and
Ieft out in the open worId...

145
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:08,886
then aII his Iife, he wiII not be
abIe to buy an underwear for himseIf.

146
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:11,893
- Go away from here!
- We are going!

147
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:14,895
PIease Ieave...keep moving ahead!

148
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:18,558
If you get such peopIe again
then you too wiII Ieave with them!

149
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:20,897
I?!...Look, they have Ieft...

150
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:26,910
Did you see, Badri Prasad
rejected this boy....

151
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,171
now we have to see if Badri Prasad
Iikes some boy or ShaIu...

152
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:32,909
wiII choose a boy for herseIf.

153
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:36,584
So from now, we begin our episodes
on `ShaIu's Iove story' !

154
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:39,188
So, we shaII meet
again in the next episode.

155
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:42,525
Nephew...dear nephew!!

156
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:45,526
Sir, did you see
my nephew...Nephew!!

157
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:48,927
Hey! You are busy pumping iron here!

158
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,662
UncIe, you are here? Have you
come to reduce your paunch?

159
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:57,536
No, I have come to teII you
that tiII 12 noon...

160
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,869
don't make an attempt
to fight anyone...

161
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:02,878
or, you wiII get into troubIe.

162
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:06,813
Why shouId I have
a fight with anybody?

163
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:07,884
You are right!

164
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:10,550
ShaIu, why are you
so crazy about Amitabh?

165
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,486
- He is unmatchabIe!
- That's true.

166
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,081
I've seen his fiIm
`Deewar' 25 times.

167
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,162
I too am his great fan!

168
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,495
I watch aII his fiIms,
first day, first show.

169
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:26,236
Amitabh is incomparabIe!

170
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,904
Wow! What a beautifuI body!

171
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:34,509
But what's the point of such a body
if it's not in good hands?

172
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,910
Wow! Such beautifuI cheeks.

173
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:43,850
But, what's the point of such cheeks
when pretty hands cannot hit them?

174
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:57,858
- Where is she? - Peter, you are
Iooking for me & I'm Iooking for you.

175
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,205
These are they gym keys,
keep it in your pocket...

176
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,478
I wiII open the Iock after I remove
these keys from your pocket.

177
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,548
Keep it!

178
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:17,883
Nephew, didn't Amitabh Bachchan use
these words in the fiIm `Deewar'?

179
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:22,082
Isn't he the one who roamed around
with a badge of the number 786?

180
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:23,160
Yes, he is the one!

181
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:31,168
What's your probIem?

182
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,173
WeII done! You have started
a wrestIing match here!

183
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:42,842
Keep watching for more!

184
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:44,181
Nephew, she jumps too!

185
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:51,180
Hey! This mister is doing yoga!

186
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,117
What are you watching? Hit him!

187
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:59,860
No, nephew! You have to controI
your fist tiII 12 noon!

188
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,406
Go away or I wiII hit you a Iot!

189
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,744
Catch her!!

190
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,485
Run!!

191
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,088
Give me a kiss,
just Iike EngIish fiIms.

192
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,833
O Lord! Save this heIpIess girI's
honor for next 3 minutes...

193
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,835
after that, my nephew
wiII change his fate!

194
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,634
Oh are you going to
take her life? Leave her!!

195
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,558
Nephew only 2 minutes are Ieft.

196
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,833
1 minute more.

197
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:47,503
HaIf a minute more.

198
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:51,033
10 seconds Ieft,
get ready to wage a war!

199
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,868
- As you say, Gurudev!
- May you gain victory!

200
00:14:56,046 --> 00:15:04,378
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two...

201
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,655
one, attack!

202
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:14,358
- Shut up, I'm raping her.
- She wiII die!

203
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,359
Don't mess with me

204
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,392
You need not worry, I am with you!
- Thank you very much!

205
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:43,184
- What's your name?
- My name is...

206
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:53,338
I cannot see!

207
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:10,688
Boys! I cannot see anything,
get him here!

208
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,493
WonderfuI move! Go out from here
and come in from there!

209
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:53,169
You've changed the fate!
Nephew, he is going!

210
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:35,216
Come in front!

211
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:38,750
Nephew! You are wonderfuI!

212
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:43,822
Friends, this wrestIing match
comes to an end here.

213
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:45,560
Jai Hind!

214
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:50,253
Listen, Mr. KhiIadi...
my name is ShaIu.

215
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,597
What is your name?

216
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,860
- What do you do?
- I was not doing anything tiII now.

217
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:58,298
But, I wiII ruIe this state,
after one year.

218
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:04,868
But, we are a democratic country,
how wiII you be the king?

219
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,604
She wants to take
the Iife of a chiId!or Uncle she is testing my patience.

220
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:11,876
Nephew, the way Meneka thwarted
Vishwamitra's penance...

221
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:14,215
this woman too wiII
thwart your penance.

222
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,548
I mean to say don't faII
for her words...

223
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,624
or, you wiII never be a king!

224
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,885
- Listen...
- Don't Iisten!

225
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:21,961
Let's go!

226
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:06,728
''Neither on Monday nor on Tuesday,
neither on Wednesday nor Thursday''

227
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:25,883
''Come in the middIe of the night''

228
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:36,836
''Come home on Fridays...

229
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:44,086
on that day I am aIone at home...

230
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:48,419
come home and kiss me''

231
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:55,497
''CaII me home on Fridays...

232
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:09,704
on that day, I am in a good mood...

233
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:13,778
caII me home and get a kiss''

234
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:18,775
''What wiII you do on a Friday,
O, do teII me what wiII you do?''

235
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,068
''I wiII Iove you a Iot''

236
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:40,739
''You faII for me,
I wiII faII for you''

237
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:44,472
''My heart beats fast''

238
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:48,078
''I feeI Iike doing
something but, I am scared''

239
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:59,280
''Don't be stubborn on a Friday,
keep up to your promise''

240
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:20,504
''If daddy mummy come here,
teII me what wiII you do?''

241
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:38,720
''I wiII teII daddy that your
daughter is very sweet...

242
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:42,719
I wiII teII mummy to become
my mother in Iaw''

243
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:46,394
''your taIks are interesting,
you are the hero of my heart'' or in talking you are my nuber one, but you are my raja.

244
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:50,068
'' But today is Sunday,
so pIease excuse me''

245
00:23:54,773 --> 00:24:00,734
''It's a Friday, don't be stubborn,
keep up to your promise''

246
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:24,162
Leave me, this is not
a pIace to romance.

247
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:28,160
Romance on sIy is done in the
backyard of the house or the car.

248
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:33,695
Let us get married, I wiII sit on
the front seat and horn in a way...

249
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:36,434
that the whoIe worId wiII know!

250
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:40,305
- Then why aren't you getting
married? - First Iet me romance!

251
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:42,447
Because, after that we wiII
get no time to romance.

252
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:45,708
- UncIe!
- Hey! Hide quickIy!!

253
00:25:46,485 --> 00:25:49,045
- UncIe, where is the car keys?
- Here it is!

254
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:58,721
- Where is the car going?
- ShaIu is driving it.

255
00:25:58,831 --> 00:26:00,731
That car's brakes have faiIed,
that is why it was here!

256
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,061
Oh, my God!

257
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,135
- What wiII happen to my ShaIu?
- What about the boot of the car?

258
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:09,138
- God, save my ShaIu!
- God, don't save the boot!

259
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,150
Listen, which bus wiII
go to Juhu Church?

260
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:23,081
Be away from the shadow
of an unmarried woman!

261
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:25,746
- I don't know.
- What is the time?

262
00:26:26,191 --> 00:26:29,160
- I don't know!
- You are wearing a watch...

263
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:31,353
and you don't know the time?
- Stay away from me!

264
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,622
I don't want to taIk to you!

265
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:35,430
Mummy, daddy bought
an ice cream for me!

266
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:39,629
Eat it, son.

267
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,698
Married woman! I have
no danger from you!

268
00:26:40,873 --> 00:26:43,364
You wanted to know the time,
it's haIf past one...

269
00:26:43,475 --> 00:26:45,773
and 5 number bus wiII go to...
- What are you doing?

270
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:48,438
- Stay away, I don't want anything!
- Don't be afraid of me!

271
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:51,448
My Iine is cIear,
you are a married woman!

272
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:55,053
How is your Iine cIear if
she is a married woman?

273
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,451
Hey! Stand in the queue, she is a
married woman, I have no probIems.

274
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,115
- But, I have a probIem with you!
- So what can I do?

275
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:03,056
- Because, she is my wife!
- Is he your husband?

276
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,390
- Yes.
- HeIIo.

277
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,134
Hey, stop!

278
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:10,401
Look in the front and run!

279
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,730
Come fatso, come after me!

280
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:18,075
Come on, chase me!

281
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,079
Come on!

282
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:26,076
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Getting down!

283
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:47,033
KiIIed me!!

284
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:50,705
- Sir...
- Come.

285
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,036
I want your statement.

286
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,445
She took my Iife,
you take my statement!

287
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,715
The girI against whose car
you met with an accident...

288
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:03,452
was it her fauIt?
- No, it was my fauIt!

289
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:06,455
ObviousIy it was her fauIt!

290
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:09,257
Sir, have you seen my nephew?

291
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:12,454
- No! - UncIe!
- Nephew!!

292
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:16,067
- SIow down, uncIe!
- What state are you in!

293
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:21,398
I've toId you to be away from
the shadow of an unmarried woman.

294
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:25,465
Now Iisten, if you want to be a
king then don't teII him that...

295
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:28,068
it was the girI's fauIt.
- Why?

296
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,740
- Give me your ear.
- I cannot come forward.

297
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:37,355
Let me teII you once more.

298
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:43,088
- What are you whispering?
- Inspector, it was my fauIt.

299
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:47,031
Instead of running on the footpath,
if I run on the middIe of the road..

300
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,030
then a car is bound
to dash against me!

301
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:52,101
- But you just said... - My head is
not working because it's hurt.

302
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:54,439
Now that my uncIe is here,
my head is functioning fine!

303
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,370
ApoIogize to that girI on my behaIf.

304
00:28:58,076 --> 00:28:59,373
- Strange man!
- I am!

305
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:06,866
Inspector, you have seen the iron
in the rods of the Iockup...

306
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:09,870
but you have not seen the
strength of my courage!

307
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:14,477
Put me in shackIes, buiId up
an iron waII around me...

308
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,810
but, I wiII break aII the waIIs.

309
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:22,144
ChiId...are you aIright?

310
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:24,483
Your chiId is strong, daddy!

311
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,816
I heard on the phone
that you are very serious.

312
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:29,551
I am not serious, he is!

313
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,891
Why are you referring to
this man so affectionateIy?

314
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:36,499
- Who is he? - The one who
dashed against my car.

315
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:39,901
Perhaps, he is my wouId be husband.

316
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,863
UncIe, what are you
seeing Iike this?

317
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,868
You are not hurt but teII me,
is the behind of the car hurt?

318
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:54,539
- Where behind? - Niece, I am
not taIking about your back.

319

336
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,426
In this episode you are seeing

00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:19,697
has not eaten anything, she has
stifIed the neck of the piIIow...

338
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:22,034
and is sitting in the garden,
breaking away the innocent grass!

339
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:24,708
A human being commits this offense
onIy two times in his Iife...

340
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:27,376
one, when he is carrying
a Iarge debt...

- Who is he? - I am in Iove with
the one who dashed against my car.

344
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:41,456
Very good! Now you
wiII get married.

345
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:45,724
Your father wiII become IoneIy onIy
then, he'II think about my marriage.

346
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,134
Don't joke uncIe, I am serious.

347
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,735
- Have you met him?
- I did go to meet him.

348
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:54,471
I took some fIowers but, he did
not even taIk to me properIy.

349
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:58,475
How couId he? You shouId not
take fIowers for a sick man...

350
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:01,739
you must take fruits, next time
you take fruits for him.

351
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:05,083
Fruits?!...AIright, I wiII

352
00:32:07,254 --> 00:32:10,485
WiII Raja accept ShaIu's
oranges and sweet Iimes?

353
00:32:10,657 --> 00:32:13,023
And if he does then
wiII he eat them?

354
00:32:13,193 --> 00:32:17,425
Let's see this in the next episode
of the seriaI `ShaIu's Iove story'.

355
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:39,657
- Why have you come here?
- I am sorry about yesterday.

356
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,732
I shouIdn't have thrown
those fIowers on you!

357
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:46,401
- Threw...What is this?
- These are fruits.

358
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:50,668
There are appIes, oranges, bananas
and the strawberries feII down.

00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:53,341
- Now wiII you throw these fruits
on me? - Not at aII!

360
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:55,676
If you eat them, you wiII
regain your heaIth very soon.

361
00:32:56,048 --> 00:33:01,418
I don't want to be! I know you wiII

362
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:04,021
I know, you want to kiII me!

363
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:08,423
- God forbid, I wiII never...
- God is not forbidding.

364
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:12,358
It is you who wants me
to die but, I wiII not!

365
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,626
PIease don't say that, you are
not weII, pIease sit down!

366
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,634

You do one thing, get him a job
in your father's factory.

416
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:57,226
After that, we wiII
taIk about marriage.

424
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:28,916
You wiII Iose your senses

425
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:32,451
Mother, your son wiII

- Okay, eat. - You've got a job
sitting at home and you're refusing?

429

You wiII have to take up this job!

430
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:49,061
Or, that miIkman is ready,
I wiII eIope with him.

Mother, she wants to eIope

00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,003
You shut up!..Listen son,

AIright mother,
I wiII Iisten to you.

436
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:04,076
But, history wiII be
a witness that...

437
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:08,949
the king took up a petty job for
the sake of his sister!

438
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,423
Hey! TeII me, where is this job?

439
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:13,752
Come on, dreamer!

440
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:20,027
- I wiII sureIy be the king!
- Excuse me, is your name Raja?

441
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:23,031
- Do you want to change my name?
- No, the boss is caIIing.

442
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:26,165
- Ask him to wait! - What?
I shouId ask the boss to wait?

443
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:29,776
It's not a good time to meet him,
what is his star sign?

444
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:32,380
He is a Cancerian.

445
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:34,775
- He is a Cancer.
- No, he is a Cancerian.

446
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,044
It aII means the same!

447
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:39,781
It's a very strong zodiac sign, they
mete out atrocities on empIoyees.

448
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,788
I suggest you shouId pack up
and Ieave this job!

449
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:45,394
Hey you, in the shorts! Go CharIie,

Okay sir, I wiII get it for you.

451
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,391
He is Cancer and I am Liberian,
there is bound to be a cIash!

452
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:58,003
- Water! - Don't you have
manners how to offer water?

453
00:42:58,174 --> 00:42:59,334
You wiII remain mannerIess
aII your Iife!

454
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:08,015
Hey! Isn't he the same? He has put
pictures of his empIoyees?

455
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:11,410
He doesn't want anyone to cast an
eviI eye on his office, right?

456
00:43:11,787 --> 00:43:13,755
Your boss is far sighted.

457
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:17,017
Do you have a tongue in your mouth
or a race horse, you taIk non stop!

458
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,688
Show me your hand!

459
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:24,899
The bad time is over, ask your boss
to interview me in next 10 minutes..

460
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:25,968
because, I have no time after that.

461
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:28,360
Come on, hurry up.

462
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,106
This is Mr. Badri Prasad,
he wiII interview you.

463
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,776
- He is the boss?
- Yes!

464
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:38,380
I don't want to work here!

465
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:43,783
- Why don't you want to work?
- Have you seen your attire?

466
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:46,045
I don't work with beggars!

467
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:48,787
AIright, I wiII change
my attire for your sake...

468
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,323

00:43:51,694 --> 00:43:54,720
You can give me 10,000/-

00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:57,855
- WiII that much be sufficient?
- Okay, give me 12,000/-

471
00:43:58,034 --> 00:43:59,331
I am feeIing sorry for you,
that's aII!

472
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:01,666
What time wiII you come for the job?

473
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:04,405
- What time does the office shut?
- At 5 p.m.

474
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:06,407
I'II be here at 4.45 p.m.

475
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:09,404
I feeI Iike cutting off your
tongue and hanging it as a tie!

476
00:44:10,046 --> 00:44:13,413
Even I feeI Iike making an underwear
out of your tongue!

477
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,418
I am quiet because of my sister and
that's why I am here for a job!

478
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:19,749
Even I am quiet because of my
daughter or you'd be in a state...

479
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:20,946
that you'd never forget!

480
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,017
You wiII have to give me
a bond of one year!

481
00:44:23,459 --> 00:44:26,758
I'II not make it for a year, it wiII
be for 1 1 months and 27 days.

482
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:29,763
- Why? - Because, after an year,
aII this wiII beIong to me!

483
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:33,094
I wiII give you a peon's job then.

484
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:35,768
- You'II have to wear fuII pants.
- Watchman! Throw him out!

485
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:40,568
Going! Do you want to kiII a kid?

486
00:44:41,477 --> 00:44:42,774
Wants to be the boss!

487
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:47,041
After a year, this wiII be mine,
you'II be a peon!

488
00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:54,723
Oh God, I don't know whether
he wiII be the boss or not...

489
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,721
but, the other man
wiII sureIy become a peon!

490
00:44:57,426 --> 00:45:03,058
You are right, a young daughter
aIways weighs on the mind of a father!

491
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:06,328
But it's not a weight that someone
can Iift and throw it away!

492
00:45:06,702 --> 00:45:09,671
AII I meant was that the man
you wish to get married to...

493
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,069
is a useIess man,
he doesn't even have a job!

494
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:16,337
As far as earning is concerned,
if you'd give him that job...

495
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:18,002
then he wouId start
earning from today itseIf!

496
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:20,679
He is the one who Iikes
to be at home and dream.

497
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:24,408
AII he thinks is astroIogy,
such a man can never do any work!

498
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:27,418
Daddy, you have
misunderstood my Raja.

499
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,758
He is very naive and simpIe.

500
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:35,361
Once I get married to him and he
gets responsibiIity of a famiIy...

501
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:37,431
he wiII stop visiting astroIogers.

502
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,764
Very good, here I am criticizing
him and you're praising him?

503
00:45:42,738 --> 00:45:45,036
Daddy, I am in Iove with him.

504
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:47,368
So, shaII I consider
this as your consent?

505
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:50,968
I wiII keep you unmarried
aII your Iife...

506
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,377
but, I wiII never Iet you
marry that useIess man!

507
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:57,312
This is strange! Inspite of
expIaining so much, you're refusing.

508
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:58,713
Now I wonder what I wiII do?

509
00:45:59,021 --> 00:46:00,386
- What wiII you do?
- Come on.

510
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:03,650
- Where? - You have bought
a new car of me.

511
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:06,727
- Let's go for a drive. - What has
a drive got to do with this matter?

512
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,386
Come on daddy, pIease.

513
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:11,727
- But, you teII me what is the
matter? - Come on, you'II enjoy!

514
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:15,394
I think you both are going
for a drive in the new car.

515
00:46:15,504 --> 00:46:19,736
- UncIe, wiII you come?
- Not untiI you drive it first.

516
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,411
- You can go ahead.
- What did he mean?

517
00:46:22,778 --> 00:46:24,336
Let's go for a drive.

518
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:29,350
WiII ShaIu be abIe to drive?
And even if she wiII drive...

519
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:31,416
then wiII she be abIe to controI
and if she does...

520
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:34,750
then wiII Badri Prasad be abIe
to waIk on his feet...

521
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:38,759
Iet us watch it in the next episode
of `ShaIu's Iove story'.

522
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:43,694
Daddy, wiII you get me
married to Raja or not?

523
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:45,766
I wiII die but,
I wiII never do that!

524
00:46:59,081 --> 00:47:00,048
Be carefuI!

525
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,990
Hey! Are you driving for a circus?

526
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:24,004
I give you one more
chance...think again!

527
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:26,733
- About what?
- WiII you get me married?

528
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:43,016
- Where did this come from?
- I picked it whiIe driving.

529
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,353
Have you gone crazy?

530
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:54,027
- Hey! Stop the car!
- Is the breeze cooI out there?

531
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:58,372
I didn't come here for breeze,
I came for my treatment.

532
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:02,373
PIease take her to a mentaI asyIum!

533
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:09,050
- Have you gone mad?
- It's yet not Iate, daddy.

534
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:11,709
- You have just Iost the doors.
- This was a new car!

535
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:17,718
Hey, oId man! Ask her to stop,
I am stiII not married.

536
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:20,789
My onIy two kidneys have faiIed...

537
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:29,820
Daddy, fasten your seat beIt,
the pIane is about to take off!

538
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:55,437
Daddy, Iast  chance
- Have you gone mad? - AIright then!

539
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:13,859
- The bonnet has gone! - Are you
driving in the weII of death?

540
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:21,806
Now onIy the roof is remaining!

541
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:27,807
Daddy, one Iast finaI chance
or it's a totaI Ioss!

542
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,141
- What are you doing?
- No??

543
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:47,098
Who were they? Which pIanet
did they beIong to?

544
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:52,428
You idiots! How couId you
Ieave me and go away?

545
00:49:53,138 --> 00:49:57,165
I trusted you and your ambuIance!

546
00:49:58,877 --> 00:50:02,779
What did you think I was?
Move this away!

547
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:18,192
We are home!

548
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:27,201
So daddy...here...what
do you think now?

549
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:28,804
ShaII I consider
this as your consent?

550
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:32,468
- What consent?
- For my marriage with Raja.

551
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:36,403
AIright, I give my consent!

552
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:39,818
- Just get me out of the car.
- That way, daddy.

553
00:50:45,853 --> 00:50:48,219
You are here too?
Why are you after me?

554
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:51,483
TeII your father that I wiII
be a king after one year...

555
00:50:51,926 --> 00:50:54,224
then, I too wiII have servants,
cars and Iuxuries!

556
00:50:54,862 --> 00:50:57,160
- I'II give your father
a peon's job. - AIright!

557
00:50:57,865 --> 00:51:01,494
Why are you getting angry?
Whether you become a king or not...

558
00:51:01,669 --> 00:51:02,829
you are the hero of my heart!

559
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:07,170
- Listen...
- What?

560
00:51:07,408 --> 00:51:09,239
- Can I sit here?
- Sit!

561
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:17,913
- Can I Iie down next to you?
- Lie!

562
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:28,458
Can I keep my hand...
on your shouIder?

563
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,197
Keep!

564
00:51:35,169 --> 00:51:36,193
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, do it quickIy!

565
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,800
- Now can I sing a song?
- Go ahead!

566
00:51:47,018 --> 00:51:49,316
''How can you buiId a bungaIow?''

567
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,388
''You cannot buy a car for me''

568
00:51:57,429 --> 00:51:59,659
''You cannot afford to take me out''

569
00:52:00,031 --> 00:52:01,999
''Forget it, Iet it be''

570
00:52:02,434 --> 00:52:04,994
''Let me be seen on the screen''

571
00:52:10,108 --> 00:52:12,668
''Let me become a hero''

572
00:52:13,044 --> 00:52:17,743
''Then you see the magic I work''

573
00:53:38,997 --> 00:53:47,962
''HonestIy, you Iook Iike a zero,
who wiII make you a fiIm hero?''

574
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,367
''The day my fate wiII shine...

575
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:58,380
that day, I wiII hoId your hand
and waIk down the aisIe''

576
00:54:00,084 --> 00:54:04,384
''This is a way of getting into my
heart, don't sweet taIk with me''

577
00:54:05,023 --> 00:54:12,395
''Let things work out''

578
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:15,395
''Let me come on the teIevision''

579
00:54:16,568 --> 00:54:20,334
''Then you see the magic I work''

580
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:18,991
''One day my dream wiII come true...

581
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:23,932
I wiII possess a bungaIow
at PaIi HiII''

582
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,602
''I wiII be draped in siIks...

583
00:55:30,975 --> 00:55:34,342
we wiII own a fIeet of cars''

584
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,610
''We shaII have bungaIow and cars,
Iet my fate shine upon me''

585
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:43,351
''Let my photo get pubIished''

586
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,358
''Let me get famous''

587
00:55:51,996 --> 00:55:56,296
''Then you see the magic I work''

588
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,610
- Stay away. Don't come behind me!
- What happened?

589
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:51,351
You were just singing a song and
having fun so, what happened?

590
00:56:51,522 --> 00:56:54,286
Now I've come to my senses,
I know the reason of my doom!

591
00:56:54,459 --> 00:56:56,620
- Who and where is it?
- In front of me, move away!

592
00:56:57,061 --> 00:57:00,360
How can it be me? What did I do?
I Iove you, Raja.

593
00:57:00,531 --> 00:57:04,365
Don't be siIIy! Get married to
a rich man as per your status.

594
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:07,368
And forget about me, I am going
to be a king after a year...

595
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:11,304
I'II have girIs queuing up for me
and if I decide to get married...

596
00:57:11,409 --> 00:57:14,378
then I wiII get married to
a princess of some kingdom.

597
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,637
I am not crazy that
I wiII marry you!

598
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,650
- Niece!
- UncIe!!

599
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:29,790
- What is the matter?
- Raja has refused to marry me.

600
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:34,055
- What can we do? - For the first
& Iast time he has done a wise thing.

601
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:37,661
What I was going to do,
he has done it.

602
00:57:38,703 --> 00:57:41,672
Daddy, if I marry,
I wiII marry onIy him!

603
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,670
ChiId, I have raised you up
with Iove Iike a princess...

604
00:57:47,045 --> 00:57:50,412
to see this day? Have I not
showered any happiness on you?

605
00:57:51,783 --> 00:57:54,411
Look there...that statue is for
two hundred thousand rupees.

606
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:57,420
This bed, chandeIier,
they aII cost 2.5 miIIion.

607
00:57:57,588 --> 00:58:02,355
AII these accessories in your room,
it costs 5 miIIions!

608
00:58:02,527 --> 00:58:03,425
Did I do aII this to see such a day?

609
00:58:03,594 --> 00:58:06,358
And the room must be
worth another 5 miIIions.

610
00:58:07,198 --> 00:58:09,428
Is it?...Just a minute.

611
00:58:11,135 --> 00:58:13,103
ChiId, you must not shoot
your father over triviaI matters!

612
00:58:13,337 --> 00:58:17,034
I know that...Daddy, the house
where there is no Iove...

613
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:18,436
what is the point of having
such statues ther

614
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:23,377
There goes two hundred
thousand rupees!

615
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:28,647
The house which has no brightness,
why shouId a chandeIier be there?

616
00:58:30,688 --> 00:58:32,315
There goes the Iight
of eighty thousand!

617
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:35,325
And what's the point
of having exhibits here?

618
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:39,996
There goes the fish tank!

619
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:42,394
- Have you gone mad?
- Now I am getting angry!

620
00:58:43,101 --> 00:58:45,001
- What are you doing?
- I shaII kiII myseIf, daddy!

621
00:58:45,169 --> 00:58:47,660
- Get me married to Raja or...
- AIright, stop it!

622
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,672
You win I Iose, you wiII get
married to him, aIright?

623
00:58:53,177 --> 00:58:56,340
But daddy, Raja has
refused to marry me.

624
00:58:56,514 --> 00:58:59,540
What are you doing? It is easy to
change his refusaI to his consent!

625
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:02,682
- Are you happy?
- Very happy!

626
00:59:03,054 --> 00:59:04,419
- ShaII we go?
- Come on!

627
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:10,204
GentIemen, what is the purpose of
doing this to my weak, feebIe, body?

628
00:59:10,582 --> 00:59:12,209
Didn't you teII Raja that
he is going to become a king?

629
00:59:12,918 --> 00:59:16,217
You taIk about other's future,
do you know your own future?

630
00:59:16,388 --> 00:59:19,221
- Do you know what wiII happen
next minute? - What does it mean?

631
00:59:19,591 --> 00:59:23,891
If you say you wiII be aIive for
next 20 years, I wiII behead you!

632
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:26,895
And if you say that you wiII die now
then I am going to kiII you anyway!

633
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:29,226
But teII me, what am I
supposed to do?

634
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:32,565
You have to match my daughter's
horoscope with Raja's.

635
00:59:32,738 --> 00:59:36,230
How is it possibIe? I have asked
him to be away from girIs.

636
00:59:36,341 --> 00:59:40,573
Now you get them cIose or this sword
wiII take you away from Iife!

637
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:44,580
No, pIease ask your sword
not to do that!

638
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,981
Then do as I say or
you wiII Iose your Iife!

639
00:59:48,687 --> 00:59:52,919
- Do you agree?
- AIright, I agree.

640
00:59:53,225 --> 00:59:55,250
- ShaII I move the sword?
- PIease do.

641
00:59:57,696 --> 01:00:01,598
UncIe, it's six and haIf months,
when wiII I be the king?

642
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,994
Your wait has ended, my nephew...

643
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:08,264
I have matched a girI's
horoscope with yours...

644
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,534
it's so perfect that it seems it's
made on the edge of a sword!

645
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,202
If you marry her,
you'II become an emperor!

646
01:00:15,647 --> 01:00:19,208
Who is she? I don't care if she is
Iame, dark, bIind, Iet me see her!

647
01:00:20,986 --> 01:00:23,546
- Hey! She is ShaIu!
- She is a very nice girI.

648
01:00:23,722 --> 01:00:26,953
She is after me and I didn't pay
attention to her because of you.

649
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:31,221
Then hurry up now, go to her,
get married and become a king!

650
01:00:31,663 --> 01:00:35,224
For the first time I have Iied
to him because of that sword!

651
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:41,571
''O driver, ride the cart sIowIy,
my hair fIies...

652
01:00:54,286 --> 01:00:56,584
This is your sister in Iaws photo!

653
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:58,586
- I am going.
- What are you doing, brother?

654
01:00:58,824 --> 01:01:01,987
HoId this!...I've found my wife!

655
01:01:02,627 --> 01:01:05,596
If I go on the cycIe
I wiII reach her faster!

656
01:01:05,831 --> 01:01:07,992
- Brother! - Leave me,
for my sake, Ieave me!

657
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:09,190
I said you go inside

658
01:01:26,651 --> 01:01:28,619
Here I come!

659
01:01:32,657 --> 01:01:37,617
Raja Babu has arrived!
Is anyone there to weIcome me?

660
01:01:38,663 --> 01:01:42,622
- Get me a chair.
- Stop screaming out Iike a vendor.

661
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:46,897
- And stand straight with respect.
- It's you who wiII respect me now.

662
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:50,240
- After aII, I am your son in Iaw!
- Is it so?

663
01:01:50,675 --> 01:01:53,906
- Who gave you this right?
- Your daughter!

664
01:01:56,348 --> 01:01:59,181
- There she is! - Hey! What
do you have on your face?

665
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:03,583
I was shaving and I...may I sit?

666
01:02:03,755 --> 01:02:07,919

667
01:02:08,026 --> 01:02:12,520
- Come.

668
01:02:12,697 --> 01:02:13,664
Yes.

669
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:18,866
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, you can.

670
01:02:20,972 --> 01:02:23,600
- How dare you do in front of me?
- Raja, are you aIright?

671
01:02:23,975 --> 01:02:26,944
- Why did you hit me?
- I wiII chop off your neck!

672
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:28,812
There's a condition
before marriage,...

673
01:02:28,914 --> 01:02:29,938
you have to give
one hundred thousand rupees!

674
01:02:30,649 --> 01:02:33,948
Daddy, the girI's side
give dowry, they don't take.

675
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:37,953
- Is it?...Get out!
- Listen to me first!

676
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:41,217
I wiII give you the money,
first you fix the wedding date.

677
01:02:41,326 --> 01:02:44,227
- No, first the money then the date.
- You are such a strange man!

678
01:02:44,396 --> 01:02:48,560
- First fix the wedding date.
- No, first the money then the date!

679
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,769
- What is it?
- Agree to what he says or...

680
01:02:53,672 --> 01:02:59,907
Okay but, if you don't give me cash
of one hundred thousand rupees...

681
01:03:00,078 --> 01:03:01,306
then I wiII not Iet
the nuptiaIs take pIace!

682
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,980
- Move....ShaIu... - Hey! TaIk
to me, what are you doing there?

683
01:03:10,622 --> 01:03:11,919
I wiII not cIap my hand
with yours, get out!

684
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:14,518
Ask him not to get
friendIy with me...

685
01:03:14,893 --> 01:03:15,917
That you wiII have to!

686
01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:24,362
Mother!...I have got a good news!

687
01:03:25,398 --> 01:03:27,423
- Oh, mother!
- What's the good news, son?

688
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:30,434
Mother, I have fixed the marriage.

689
01:03:31,404 --> 01:03:33,702
God bIess you, son!

690
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:35,775
And Iook at you, you just
keep fighting with your brother!

691
01:03:35,942 --> 01:03:38,035
Mother, God bIess my brother!

692
01:03:38,144 --> 01:03:41,045
Listen to me now, I want to
print 1 ,000 cards.

693
01:03:41,147 --> 01:03:43,707
What wiII you do with so many cards?

694
01:03:43,817 --> 01:03:46,718
Listen, if I give one card,
I wiII get back 100 rupees.

695
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,914
And thus, if I give 1 ,000 cards, I
wiII coIIect Rs. 1 ,00,000/-...

696
01:03:50,023 --> 01:03:52,457
and when I get that amount,
I wiII give it to that beggar.

697
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:57,054
Listen brother, you can abuse me
as much as you want but not them!

698
01:03:57,163 --> 01:03:59,791
Listen to her! He is my father
in Iaw, why is she getting upset?

699
01:04:00,834 --> 01:04:03,064
- Your father in Iaw?
- What is he saying?

700
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:06,462
- Who is getting married?
- Mother, I am getting married!

701
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,803
How can you do that son, your young
unmarried sister is at home...

702
01:04:10,176 --> 01:04:11,803
and you have fixed your marriage?

703
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:14,413
Mother, onIy when I get married,

704
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:17,408
And pIease, don't add to my tension.

705
01:04:17,651 --> 01:04:19,414
I have to print the cards
and then seII them.

706
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:21,686
Don't you get happy
hearing anything?

707
01:04:22,122 --> 01:04:23,680
- You aIways keep crying!
- Mother!!

708
01:04:23,857 --> 01:04:26,758
You keep quiet! My Raja

709
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:29,361
- He must have thought of something!
- Rubbish!

You can wipe your body

01:05:14,507 --> 01:05:16,475
Come on, Iet's go!

725

729
01:05:33,994 --> 01:05:36,758
My mother said that our far off

730
01:05:36,997 --> 01:05:39,761

You can assume you have given money

Oh God, you are so merciIess!
But son, don't get disheartened.

741
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:16,795
Not everyone is destined
to happiness.

742
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:19,063
It's my nephews wedding
on the 15th...

743
01:06:19,506 --> 01:06:22,805
your father had promised that
he wouId attend his wedding.

- PIease come for the wedding.

Don't keep kissing me! You give
these dirty wet kisses so often!

754
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:31,077
Hey priest, stop it!
This wedding cannot take pIace!

755
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:35,073
- What are you saying? - You were
supposed to give me the money.

756
01:07:35,515 --> 01:07:37,745
- You have not so, the wedding
is canceIed. - Give me the mike!

757
01:07:37,851 --> 01:07:40,411
Give me that mike...here!

758
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:43,818
Ladies and gentIemen, due to some
unavoidabIe circumstances...

759
01:07:43,923 --> 01:07:46,824
this wedding is canceIed, we are

760
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:49,417

As the nuptiaIs wiII get over,
peopIe wiII start giving me money...

763
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:56,832
I wiII coIIect that money
and give it to you.

764
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:58,833
Why wiII they give you money?

765
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:00,097
They wiII give me wedding gift.

766
01:08:03,143 --> 01:08:05,509
Oh, I see! You couId not earn
with your hard work...

767
01:08:05,678 --> 01:08:08,112
that is why you want to take
donation from them and get married?

768
01:08:08,548 --> 01:08:12,644
I wiII not Iet this wedding
take pIace, canceI it!

769
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:15,583
- How can you canceI it?

01:08:15,755 --> 01:08:18,121

771
01:08:18,224 --> 01:08:20,385
- But, whom do you want to
set on fire? - MyseIf!

772
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,461
Your daughter wants
to commit suicide!

773
01:08:23,563 --> 01:08:24,723
- ShaII I give her the fueI?
- Shut up!

774
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:27,061
ChiId, why do you want to
commit suicide?

775
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:31,067
It's better I die rather than going
back without getting married!

776
01:08:31,771 --> 01:08:34,137
AIright, you do as you pIease!

777
01:08:34,507 --> 01:08:36,407
Let the wedding take pIace.

778
01:08:40,513 --> 01:08:44,074

779
01:08:44,184 --> 01:08:46,084

weIcoming me Iike this?

01:08:55,768 --> 01:08:58,328
Nephew, hoId this sword.

01:08:59,438 --> 01:09:02,999

- When the kings get married....

782
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:05,002
they hoId a sword in their hand.

783
01:09:05,377 --> 01:09:07,045
If you hoId it,
you wiII become a king.

784
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:08,647
I will also become?
- Yes!

785
01:09:08,748 --> 01:09:11,248
Come hurry!

786
01:09:12,961 --> 01:09:14,986
Friends, are you
enjoying the wedding?

787
01:09:15,164 --> 01:09:18,998
- Yes! - TeII us, why is the groom
hoIding a sword in his hand?

788
01:09:19,168 --> 01:09:22,262
That's because, the groom
had made a vow...

789
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:26,265
a known sage toId him that...

790
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:30,601
if he cuts of the right hand of 200
guests and offers to the God...

791
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:34,078
he wiII be renowned in this worId
and wiII become the king.

792
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:38,011
You mean that when we go to
give him his present...

793
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:40,621
he wiII cut off our right hand?

794
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:42,687
Yes, you go that right!

795
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:47,022
Don't say that to anybody or
before your hand is cut...

796
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:49,290
he wiII chop off my neck!

797
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:56,295
What happened?...Hey! WiII you read
out aII the vows in my wedding?

798
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:59,038
Stop aII this and start the
program of receiving cash!

799
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:06,578
Ladies and gentIemen, now you can
come and give gifts to the coupIe.

800
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:08,650
Come on, everyone!

801
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:16,550
Stop looking at your right hands,
give your gifts now.

802
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,950
- Uncle!!
- Yes, nephew.

803
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,850
Sir, congratulations,
where is my fees?

804
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,550
Will you kill the kid, you fatso?

805
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,050
l didn't get anything and
you are asking for fees?

806
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:37,750
Let me have my nuptial night,
till then you have this apple!

807
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,950
Oh! So you are acting tough
on our nuptial night?

808
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,950
Neither did you wait for your
husband nor did you kiss him...

809
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:51,950
nor did you offer milk and
are lying down like this?

810
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:55,950
And, how come you have
become so fat?

811
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,550
You are excited about
our nuptial night!

812
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,250
What nuptial night
are you talking about?

813
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:07,550
You are imitating
your father's voice.

814
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:10,150
This is no imitation,
it is reality!

815
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:14,150
What are you doing here?

816
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,850
- You have to give me money?
- What money?

817
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,550
- One hundred thousand rupees.
- What hundred thousand rupees?

818
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,850
You aren't ashamed of taking money
from your son in law on this day?

819
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:26,250
You idiot! You promised to give me
this money before marriage.

820
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,850
You did not fulfill it, you promised
that before the marriage vows...

821
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,550
you'd give the money but,
you changed.

822
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:33,250
Now l will not change, please.

823
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,950
- l will give it after the
nuptial night. - Shut up!

824
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:37,550
- l said l'll give, please!
- Get lost!

825
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:41,550
Only when a thousand liars must
have died, you were born!

826
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:44,250
Settle my account
or get lost from here.

827
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,750
Which bank will be open now?
l will give it to you!

828
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,950
You cannot afford to buy poison
and you are talking about a bank?

829
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:53,950
- Take it tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning? - Promise!

830
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,950
You will give me?...Alright then!

831
01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,550
He is still here!

832
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,650
- Let me have my nuptial night?
- When have you promised the money?

833
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,550
- Tomorrow. - Then have
your nuptial night tomorrow.

834
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,550
What's all this?

835
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,550
Daddy, what are you doing here?

836
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:19,150
He is building a wall of
money between you and me!

837
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:23,550
- Daddy, you are ruining your
daughter's... - With petrol!

838
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:27,950
- You have so much money and yet...
- He begs from his son in law.

839
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,550
- Will you let me talk?
- Okay, you talk!

840
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:37,050
Listen you rascal, if you touch her
without giving me the money...

841
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,250
then l will cut off your hands.

842
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,950
Atleast let him drink the milk.

843
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,250
Why give him milk, it's not
a snake festival today.

844
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,950
He is just too much! What will you
do if l don't give you the money?

845
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:53,550
Hold this!..lf l catch your neck
and throw you out....

846
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,650
then what will you do?

847
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,550
Listen to me, daddy!

848
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,650
People generally push the groom
inside the bride's chamber...

849
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,650
and you are throwing the groom
out of the bride's chamber!

850
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,750
Why are you doing this to me?

851
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:09,550
Let me explain, son, if you
don't give me the money...

852
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,950
and try to even step
into my compound...

853
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:15,950
then l will catch your neck
and throw you out.

854
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,950
- Ask me how?
- Here l go?...How?

855
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:28,950
Will Raja have his nuptial night?

856
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:32,850
Will Badri Prasad let him have his
nuptial night without the money?

857
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,550
What will Shalu do? Will she
have the nuptial night...

858
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,650
or become a widow in a white sari?

859
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:42,850
To see this, let's meet after the
break, with tea, water and juice!

860
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:48,050
Uncle, l am doomed!!

861
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,950
After marriage, such pranks look good
with your wife, not your uncle!

862
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:58,550
- Take this and go back to her!
- Stop kissing me, uncle!

863
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,950
- l am tensed.
- Now why are you tensed?

864
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:04,250
That old man is not letting me
have my nuptial night!

865
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:06,850
He says he wants the money, after
that will he allow the nuptial night!

866
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:08,950
You mean you did not
have your nuptial night?

867
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:12,950
- No!
- That's a very bad news!

868
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,150
- What do you mean? - lf you
don't have your nuptial night...

869
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:21,150
then your stars of becoming a king
will always be in danger!

870
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:24,550
- What do l do? - Do anything but,
have you nuptial night!

871
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,850
- Do you have an idea?
- Give me your ear for the idea!

872
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,550
Uncle!!

873
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,850
- Do it!
- l am not a pervert.

874
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,950
Why doesn't this boy ever kiss me?

875
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:46,950
There, l have found my Shalu!

876
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,550
lt's me, Raja!!

877
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:03,650
- Raja, you...??!! - Keep quiet
or your old man will come!

878
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:12,450
- Tell me something, Shalu.
- Yes, dear husband.

879
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:13,550
Why am l going reverse?

880
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:18,550
When l cannot bear dirty fishes
outside, how can l keep them at home?

881
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:22,850
You tell me something, do you
hover around the room 24 hours?

882
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:25,950
Yes, a young girl's father is like
a watchman of the Taj Mahal!

883
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:29,550
He has the fear that some vile man
may dirty the Taj Mahal!

884
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:32,150
Stop it daddy, he is my husband!

885
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,150
Yes daddy, stop it,
l am her husband!

886
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,550
You still don't have the licence
of being her husband.

887
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,150
When you give the money,
you'll get the licence.

888
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,150
Why do you just keep asking
for money all the time?

889
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:43,550
What do we lack?
l mean, what do you lack?

890
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:44,550
l lack one hundred thousand rupees!

891
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:48,250
Daddy, you want to separate
a couple for this petty amount?

892
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,150
Daddy, from where will
he get so much money?

893
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:54,850
l don't care but, until he doesn't
give the money, he cannot meet you!

894
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:57,250
Hey, someone! Throw him out!

895
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:00,550
Going! Why do you ask me to leave in
the old style, try something new!

896
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,550
l am going!...Look at
this new style!

897
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:07,850
- What is this new style?
- lt's your son in laws style!

898
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:10,250
Okay, hit me with your slipper!

899
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,950
Son, everyone around is
asking me...

900
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:14,050
where is your daughter in law?

901
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,950
You tell me son,
what do l answer them?

902
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:21,850
Simple, tell them l have vowed that
until my sister doesn't get married...

903
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,550
l will not get my wife home.

904
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,950
Anyway, that old woman
has crossed her 20's.

905
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:29,550
lf l depend on you,
l will cross 60 too!

906
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,650
- There come the old woman!
- l have stopped depending on you!

907
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:34,950
l trust that Pantya now.

908
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:38,950
Who Pantya?...lsn't he the
one who cuts my hair?

909
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:42,950
Atleast he will feed me two meals
and clothes to cover myself.

910
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,550
l will tear his clothes!
Don't talk rubbish!

911
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:48,350
Why don't you tell her? Her brother
is a king and husband a barber?

912
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:51,250
- Keep your mouth shut!
- You don't worry about me.

913
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:54,550
The debtors are waiting outside,
you worry about them!

914
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:56,950
Yes son, what will you tell them?

915
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,050
Mother, will they kill a kid?

916
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,650
- l will chop them into pieces!
- Oh God!

917
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,850
- Hello...sir...come out!
- Why are you crowding here?

918
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:10,550
- You've forgotten us? l played
the band. - And l got the horse.

919
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,950
- l am the sweet maker.
- And l am the decorator!

920
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:17,650
Sir, l read out
your wedding nuptials.

921
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,950
And l printed your wedding cards.

922
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,250
And you are asking
why we are crowding here?

923
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:25,250
For whom did you do all this?

924
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,550
For your wedding!

925
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:32,650
For my wedding! Do you know
the meaning of marriage?

926
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:37,250
lt means that after marriage, the
bride comes to the groom's house.

927
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:40,250
The couple has a nuptial night...
You wretched men...

928
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:41,950
neither did l have a nuptial night
nor did my bride come home.

929
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,650
We don't care, we want our money!

930
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:47,950
Will you kill a kid, fatso?

931
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:53,550
Do one thing, get my wife here,
l will give you your money.

932
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,950
Let's all go and get money
from that old man!

933
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:59,350
Wait! l will go on the horse and
you all will walk behind me!

934
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:02,950
- Okay! - Wait!
The band will follow me.

935
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:06,250
- Okay!
- Wait...okay, let's go!

936
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,250
Get the mare here!

937
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:16,550
Cool down!...Come on, follow me!

938
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,550
Come and get your money!

939
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:26,619
''What?''

940
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:38,719
''l have totally flipped for you''

941
01:19:38,919 --> 01:19:40,919
''l shall never part from you''

942
01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:46,219
''l love you, O my beloved,
l want to take you with me''

943
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:48,919
''l have totally flipped for you''

944
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:50,919
''l shall never part from you''

945
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:56,519
''l love you, O my beloved,
l want to take you with me''

946
01:20:53,519 --> 01:20:57,819
''l belong to you 1002/2,
l swear it upon my love''

947
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:02,919
''l shall never betray you,
l mean it 10002/2''

948
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:07,919
''l agree that you
belong to me 1002/2....

949
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:12,919
but you are a smooth talker, what if
your words don't prove true?''

950
01:21:48,919 --> 01:21:53,919
''l don't eye other women,
l have no string of affairs''

951
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:58,919
''My gaze is fixed on you,
there is nobody else besides you''

952
01:21:59,619 --> 01:22:04,219
''The guys are crazy about me
but, l have fallen for you..

953
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:08,919
you have made me crazy about you
working your charm on me''

954
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:27,919
''People cry in love''

955
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:40,519
''Lovers part in love,
you will know my worth....

956
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:47,919
only when you fall love someone
the way l love you''

957
01:23:22,082 --> 01:23:25,382
- Raja, you?! - Your father will
not let us be together on land.

958
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:27,382
So l thought of
meeting you in water!

959
01:23:31,482 --> 01:23:32,682
You are great!

960
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:38,382
- So, let's hug each other.
- Come on!

961
01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:52,082
- Where did you land from?
- From up!

962
01:23:52,182 --> 01:23:54,482
- Who gave you the news?
- The fishes!

963
01:23:54,582 --> 01:23:58,082
- Are they your aunts?
- Yes, they are!

964
01:24:00,382 --> 01:24:02,682
What do you want?
Do you want to kill a kid?

965
01:24:02,882 --> 01:24:05,682
- What do you want tell me?
- Okay, don't cry!

966
01:24:06,382 --> 01:24:07,382
l will have mercy on you today.

967
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:10,982
Don't give me the entire amount
together, give in 4 installments.

968
01:24:11,582 --> 01:24:14,682
With the first 25,000/-
you can enter my house.

969
01:24:17,382 --> 01:24:20,382
With the next 25,000/- you can
eat your meals with her.

970
01:24:23,382 --> 01:24:26,582
With the third installment,
you can touch her like this.

971
01:24:27,882 --> 01:24:31,382
And with the final installment,
she becomes your wife!

972
01:24:32,682 --> 01:24:33,982
After that, whatever...

973
01:24:36,482 --> 01:24:38,382
- Leave her!
- Can l have my nuptial night?

974
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:41,782
- You can! - What if l give
the fourth installment first?

975
01:24:41,882 --> 01:24:43,982
What if l make that fourth
installment into the entire amount?

976
01:24:44,482 --> 01:24:47,982
Just ask for money and slip away
like a slippery fish!

977
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:51,382
You think you can get your way?
Get out from here!

978
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:54,382
l am going, don't touch me!

979
01:24:54,782 --> 01:24:58,082
Shalu, l will see you again!
l said l am going!

980
01:25:03,382 --> 01:25:06,682
Where are you?
Good riddance of bad rubbish!

981
01:25:07,382 --> 01:25:10,382
Never! You can never get rid of me!

982
01:25:10,582 --> 01:25:13,682
- Come child, he will not leave us!
- Come...hit me!

983
01:25:14,482 --> 01:25:19,382
Where are you going, fatso? You
keep hitting me all the time!

984
01:25:21,772 --> 01:25:25,172
- Saturn and Venus...
- l think you are free.

985
01:25:25,772 --> 01:25:27,672
l am, does it bother you?

986
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:31,372
Sir, don't get angry,
l wanted a small favor.

987
01:25:31,472 --> 01:25:34,772
- l'll charge Rs.1 ,00,000/-.
- Don't joke with a poor man!

988
01:25:34,872 --> 01:25:37,372
Okay, give me Rs. 25,000/-,
l will manage.

989
01:25:37,472 --> 01:25:40,372
l have a problem in my stomach,
please handle my sheep.

990
01:25:41,772 --> 01:25:45,072
l should handle your sheep?
Do you know who l am?

991
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:49,072
- l am a king, how can l do this?
- You will have to!

992
01:25:49,272 --> 01:25:51,772
- l will come in some time!
- Hey, listen to me!

993
01:25:52,672 --> 01:25:54,972
This is too much! The kings
are not respected anymore!

994
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,772
People hand over sheep to them!

995
01:25:58,772 --> 01:26:01,672
When the Saturn meet Venus,
there is a change in life.

996
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:07,372
- Then it... - Brother,
are you educating this sheep?

997
01:26:08,072 --> 01:26:11,672
This is not an ordinary sheep, it
can predict the future, it talks!

998
01:26:11,872 --> 01:26:14,372
- Prove it to me.
- l will charge Rs. 1 ,00,000/-.

999
01:26:14,772 --> 01:26:18,072
- Such a big amount?
- You don't believe me?

1000
01:26:18,272 --> 01:26:21,372
lt can predict the future of
your family, buy it now.

1001
01:26:22,772 --> 01:26:26,372
- But, l have only Rs. 25,000/-.
- Will do!

1002
01:26:26,772 --> 01:26:29,072
- First prove it to me!
- Alright, see this.

1003
01:26:29,772 --> 01:26:33,072
Okay sheep, tell me, which
month comes after April?

1004
01:26:35,772 --> 01:26:38,272
Wow!...Once more!

1005
01:26:38,772 --> 01:26:42,072
Okay, which month comes before June?

1006
01:26:45,672 --> 01:26:48,072
Wow! This is an amazing sheep!

1007
01:26:49,772 --> 01:26:52,372
Here, take the money, come with me!

1008
01:26:53,372 --> 01:26:56,372
Hey listen, before l go,
make it talk once more.

1009
01:26:56,472 --> 01:26:57,672
Don't you trust me?

1010
01:27:00,072 --> 01:27:03,372
- Who is the sheep amongst you both?
- Answer!

1011
01:27:03,672 --> 01:27:04,672
Answer him!

1012
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:08,772
Wow! My family will be happy!
Come let's go!

1013
01:27:13,072 --> 01:27:14,672
Okay, the first installment is here,
l can make an entry!

1014
01:27:16,172 --> 01:27:19,472
Your royal son in law is here
with the first installment!

1015
01:27:19,772 --> 01:27:21,772
ls there anyone around
to welcome me?

1016
01:27:22,772 --> 01:27:24,672
You are the biggest stigma
attached to this family...

1017
01:27:25,772 --> 01:27:30,472
who will welcome you?
- Here, take your money!

1018
01:27:30,772 --> 01:27:35,072
- Watch out! - Why are you falling
at his feet and giving the cash?

1019
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:38,672
l am not falling at his feet,
l tripped on the steps.

1020
01:27:38,772 --> 01:27:40,272
- Can l lift him?
- Don't you dare!

1021
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:43,972
l want him to stand on his feet.
Stand up!

1022
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:45,972
Was l standing on your feet
till now?

1023
01:27:46,172 --> 01:27:49,672
You were not standing on anybody's
feet, you are like a cripple!

1024
01:27:49,872 --> 01:27:52,372
lt's yet not late, learn to
stand on your own feet!

1025
01:27:52,472 --> 01:27:55,372
Will you keep hitting me all
the time? Will you kill the kid?

1026
01:27:55,472 --> 01:27:58,072
- A kid like you should be killed!
- Then go ahead!

1027
01:27:59,072 --> 01:28:00,972
Come on, now hit me!

1028
01:28:01,772 --> 01:28:04,372
Raja, why are you sitting
at daddy's feet?

1029
01:28:04,472 --> 01:28:06,672
l am not love, give me a hand.

1030
01:28:06,872 --> 01:28:09,372
Don't touch her, you have to give
another installment for that!

1031
01:28:09,672 --> 01:28:12,072
- l am asking her for a kiss.
- l meant installment of money!

1032
01:28:15,172 --> 01:28:17,672
- Take the money.
- Yes, collect it.

1033
01:28:17,872 --> 01:28:21,072
Why are you taking it,
come with me.

1034
01:28:23,772 --> 01:28:26,672
Don't keep it in your pocket.

1035
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,673
Raja, what is this noise?

1036
01:28:36,974 --> 01:28:40,674
Hounded by circumstances,
and by their father in low ...

1037
01:28:40,675 --> 01:28:42,475
...the romance of husband and
wife is at its final stage.

1038
01:28:46,476 --> 01:28:49,176
If that is an ambulance
going, just forget it.

1039
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:53,177
How did you get
so much money?

1040
01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:57,178
Nothing much, I just
sold a goat to somebody.

1041
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,179
And I got the money!

1042
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:06,180
Shalu, what is your father
upto on the floor?

1043
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:08,981
Raja get up!

1044
01:29:12,682 --> 01:29:15,682
And how has the noise stopped?

1045
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:18,383
I will tell you. I knew you
will play these dirty tricks.

1046
01:29:18,484 --> 01:29:21,084
That is how I fitted a
transmitter in my daughter.

1047
01:29:22,285 --> 01:29:24,185
Daddy, is there a
current in my body?

1048
01:29:24,786 --> 01:29:27,386
Yes, so that if he touches
you I will come to know.

1049
01:29:27,887 --> 01:29:30,187
Remove the current, or else our
children will be in form of tube ...

1050
01:29:30,188 --> 01:29:31,188
lights and bulbs!

1051
01:29:34,889 --> 01:29:37,389
I will tell you. Come.
- Ok, Shalu I will make a move.

1052
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:42,690
I will remove the transmitter
when you get the next instalment.

1053
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:44,791
Till then don't bring
your face here.

1054
01:29:46,692 --> 01:29:49,192
Whole life, I will not
let him touch you.

1055
01:29:50,193 --> 01:29:53,793
I will give you the go by.
Go, fit a transmitter.

1056
01:29:56,094 --> 01:29:57,494
I wish this pillow
was of stone.

1057
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:04,195
Will he get next instalment? Will
Shalu just keep ringing bells?

1058
01:30:04,196 --> 01:30:07,996
And how will he get it? We
will see in the next episode of ...

1059
01:30:07,797 --> 01:30:10,797
The Love of Shalu.
We people.

1060
01:30:13,598 --> 01:30:21,098
Hail the Lord!

1061
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:26,199
Say, how can I help you?

1062
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,000
Not this side, there.

1063
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:36,801
This is my file, help
whatever you can.

1064
01:30:38,502 --> 01:30:43,202
If you can't see, how did you
earn so many degrees?

1065
01:30:44,203 --> 01:30:49,603
After his last degree, when he
was singing and going, suddenly ...

1066
01:30:49,604 --> 01:30:51,404
... a car ...
- Enough Uncle, enough.

1067
01:30:52,705 --> 01:30:57,405
I lost my eyes in that accident.
- There is no juice left in his ...

1068
01:30:57,406 --> 01:31:01,906
... life, so he wants to
open a juice factory.

1069
01:31:03,907 --> 01:31:06,207
If I get 1,00, 000 Rs
it will be great.

1070
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:10,108
Your intentions are good, but I
can not give such a big figure.

1071
01:31:10,109 --> 01:31:12,109
Then give as much as you can.

1072
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:13,910
Presently manage
with Rs 25, 000.

1073
01:31:15,211 --> 01:31:17,011
Ok, sir, give Rs 25, 000.

1074
01:31:17,012 --> 01:31:19,612
The Singapore payment has come.
Malaysia payment hasn't ...

1075
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:27,113
Your next payment ha come.
I want mu life. Go call her.

1076
01:31:27,414 --> 01:31:29,514
Ok!
- Hey, where are you going?

1077
01:31:30,215 --> 01:31:32,215
I am going to call his wife,
Shalu. - You stand here.

1078
01:31:33,516 --> 01:31:35,916
Are you his man or mine?
- Raja, you have come?

1079
01:31:37,317 --> 01:31:41,517
Yes, I have .... - Hold it.
You can not touch her!

1080
01:31:42,118 --> 01:31:43,318
You can have only
food prepared by her.

1081
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:45,719
But atleast I can
do the action!

1082
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:56,420
Lord, it is not in my fate
to touch you, but atleast ...

1083
01:31:56,421 --> 01:32:00,421
... I will gain a good virtules
by feeding you! Yes!

1084
01:32:00,222 --> 01:32:05,422
Let us go. Listen I have
paid you Rs 50, 000. Lets go ...

1085
01:32:07,823 --> 01:32:09,423
What will you have?
- i WILL HAVE THAT GREEN VEGETABLE.

1086
01:32:12,624 --> 01:32:15,824
wHY HAVE YOU STOPPED YOUR
HANDS? That siren will blow.

1087
01:32:15,825 --> 01:32:19,225
Today when I was having
a bath, the fuse blew up!

1088
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,300
Shalu, father jas come.

1089
01:32:30,501 --> 01:32:32,801
Who was making those
deadly sounds?

1090
01:32:34,102 --> 01:32:36,002
My finger got burnt.
I was showing its to him.

1091
01:32:36,003 --> 01:32:39,603
Be careful, ok you
go. I will feed him.

1092
01:32:39,704 --> 01:32:45,604
No, Shalu can
feed me. You go

1093
01:32:47,705 --> 01:32:50,105
I have given Rs 25 000. I will
not eat from your hands.

1094
01:32:50,506 --> 01:32:54,306
No, I will not leave. I wil give
RS 100 and eat from a Waiter.

1095
01:32:55,207 --> 01:32:58,707
Stop hitting me.
- Go, he id calling you.

1096
01:33:02,108 --> 01:33:05,408
One day, I will take away your ...
daughter. Taking a child' life.

1097
01:33:07,109 --> 01:33:08,909
Yes, Rambabu, why are you
sitting with your face hung?

1098
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:13,110
Syr, one crook has cheated me
of Rs 25 000

1099
01:33:14,811 --> 01:33:17,611
I have taken a oath, till I
nave caught him, I will not ...

1100
01:33:17,612 --> 01:33:19,712
eat a morsel.
- Who is he?

1101
01:33:19,913 --> 01:33:21,113
Now what to tell ...

1102
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:27,514
That is him! The one who sold
me a goat for Rs 25,000.

1103
01:33:28,315 --> 01:33:31,615
He has seen me!
- That is him? Yes.

1104
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:34,916
Bastard!
Run...

1105
01:33:40,917 --> 01:33:41,917
Catch him!
Caught!

1106
01:33:42,218 --> 01:33:44,718
Not her, catch him.
Who?

1107
01:33:45,819 --> 01:33:46,819
What happened?

1108
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:09,120
Don't you recognise me, I gave
you a loan of Rs 25000.

1109
01:34:11,221 --> 01:34:15,221
Oh, Mr Bose! But
why are you running?

1110
01:34:16,722 --> 01:34:21,822
A thief took away the money you
had given, and also my glasses ...

1111
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:29,923
... as well as my stick. Tell me,
why has God written so many ...

1112
01:34:29,924 --> 01:34:31,024
problems in the path
of we blind people.

1113
01:34:31,025 --> 01:34:36,025
Don't worry. His need may be
more. Come with me, our Boss ...

1114
01:34:36,026 --> 01:34:38,826
... will surely help you.

1115
01:34:44,427 --> 01:34:49,327
See his boss and see my father
in law! Money, money, thats all!

1116
01:34:51,228 --> 01:34:52,928
Ooops, he is taking me back to
my father in law! I'm finished.

1117
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:57,229
He will have me beaten.

1118
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:13,730
You said, you will take me to
your boss, where have we come?

1119
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:16,431
This is my boss's house. Come.

1120
01:35:17,132 --> 01:35:19,332
Now that I have seen it
I will come later.

1121
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:21,933
Since you are here, you
might as well meet him.

1122
01:35:21,934 --> 01:35:24,634
Today is Friday. I don't
accept money today.

1123
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:28,435
Mr Bose, how come
this side today?

1124
01:35:28,436 --> 01:35:30,336
Why have you worn this?

1125
01:35:30,337 --> 01:35:33,837
Nobody should make fun of
a blind man, that is why.

1126
01:35:33,838 --> 01:35:37,138
Who is he? - Poor chap is
blind, he wants to meet the boss

1127
01:35:38,439 --> 01:35:42,139
Our boss meets blind dumb
and deaf. All! Come please.

1128
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:44,040
Consider my hand as your
stick and come with me.

1129
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:54,741
How did you know there
are stairs here?

1130
01:35:54,942 --> 01:35:57,542
God has given eyes
to the blindmen's legs.

1131
01:35:58,543 --> 01:36:00,143
Understood, now
right from here.

1132
01:36:00,144 --> 01:36:01,644
From there, we have to
turn left.

1133
01:36:01,645 --> 01:36:04,745
How did you know we
have to turn left?

1134
01:36:04,746 --> 01:36:07,046
Those same eyes which
are in the legs.

1135
01:36:07,047 --> 01:36:09,547
Yes, yes, those eyes
of the blind man.

1136
01:36:11,548 --> 01:36:17,548
Save me.
Thanks you saved me.

1137
01:36:21,349 --> 01:36:24,449
Mr Bose you?
- Greetings boss.

1138
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:27,250
Who is this?
- Poor chap is blind.

1139
01:36:27,851 --> 01:36:29,451
Why has he got a helmet on?

1140
01:36:29,452 --> 01:36:32,552
He is embarressed of his plight.
That's how he covers himself.

1141
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:36,253
He is setting up a juice factory.
He is collecting money for it.

1142
01:36:39,354 --> 01:36:44,154
What a ideal man, and there is
my son in law, a real bastard.

1143
01:36:44,455 --> 01:36:48,055
Look whatever it is
he is your son in law.

1144
01:36:48,056 --> 01:36:51,756
Don't keep insulting him
in front of everybody.

1145
01:36:51,757 --> 01:36:53,757
He is blind, not a deaf!
- Look, you ...

1146
01:36:53,758 --> 01:36:58,458
Daddy, uncle is right, what ever
it be, hi is my husband.

1147
01:36:58,459 --> 01:37:00,459
You have no right to
insult him.

1148
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:03,860
If he is adain seen here I will
have him slaughtered and sell ...

1149
01:37:03,861 --> 01:37:07,261
... his meat in the market
at 4 annas a kilo.

1150
01:37:07,262 --> 01:37:10,762
Sir, don't talk against your
son in law like this.

1151
01:37:11,763 --> 01:37:14,763
You knifed your son in law, but
this good man is getting hurt.

1152
01:37:14,764 --> 01:37:18,064
And if you intervene again, your
meat will also be sold there.

1153
01:37:21,065 --> 01:37:22,865
Here, give this to the blind man.

1154
01:37:22,866 --> 01:37:28,466
What is it?
Oh it is gram!

1155
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:32,067
He is blind, he can not see.

1156
01:37:35,968 --> 01:37:36,968
You! Raja!

1157
01:37:41,369 --> 01:37:42,969
Sir, you know him?

1158
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:45,370
Unfortunately, he  is my son
in law.

1159
01:37:45,571 --> 01:37:46,971
He is not blind?

1160
01:37:46,972 --> 01:37:49,572
No. But having eyes,
hi is blind.

1161
01:37:50,873 --> 01:37:55,573
You have fallen so much,
stealing goats and doing frauds?

1162
01:37:55,574 --> 01:37:59,774
What to do? I have to collect
Rs 100 000. I have to work hard!

1163
01:37:59,775 --> 01:38:07,375
I didn't ask you to do fraud,
and cheat peaple. Get him out.

1164
01:38:07,376 --> 01:38:12,176
Nobody will touch me. I am
your son in law not a pimp.

1165
01:38:12,177 --> 01:38:15,377
You cannot keep kicking me out
like this. I will go on my own.

1166
01:38:17,378 --> 01:38:19,778
I am taking the gram.
This I wil not allow.

1167
01:38:19,779 --> 01:38:21,479
If not your daughter, let
me take atleast the gram!

1168
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,880
I will not even allow you to take
my garbage.

1169
01:38:23,881 --> 01:38:25,081
See your daughter is calling you.

1170
01:38:26,882 --> 01:38:31,782
Come Shalu. - Oh, get out!
- Bye, Raja.

1171
01:38:34,883 --> 01:38:37,783
Nothing can be made all right
in this house.

1172
01:38:37,784 --> 01:38:40,184
Come! - Yes, I am coming Daddy.

1173
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:44,585
You here!

1174
01:38:44,286 --> 01:38:52,686
We have come to explain the
Seth, his daughter in our honor.

1175
01:38:52,887 --> 01:38:53,987
Go, go ahead!

1176
01:38:58,488 --> 01:39:01,088
Who has allowed these
beggars to come in?

1177
01:39:04,089 --> 01:39:05,289
How are you talking, brother.

1178
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:11,390
Queen mother, sorry I didn;t
recognise you. You daughter ...

1179
01:39:11,391 --> 01:39:15,591
too has come. Where are your
elephants, horses ect?

1180
01:39:15,592 --> 01:39:19,092
And today you are not
wearing your royal robe.

1181
01:39:19,093 --> 01:39:20,593
How are you talking brother?

1182
01:39:20,594 --> 01:39:24,494
Iam speaking your son's
language. He calls himself ...

1183
01:39:24,495 --> 01:39:32,695
... a king 100 times a day.
Nowadays he is become a cheat.

1184
01:39:32,696 --> 01:39:35,896
He defrauds people of their money.

1185
01:39:36,897 --> 01:39:40,297
It doesn't suit you to
insult a poor widow.

1186
01:39:41,298 --> 01:39:45,998
Insult? Those who have respect
are insulted. Those who have ...

1187
01:39:45,999 --> 01:39:49,199
son like Raja, should
not talk of any respect.

1188
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:54,000
You may give me 1000 abuses,
but don't insult my son!

1189
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:59,801
He only deserves abuses, nothing
else. Instead of worrying of his ...

1190
01:39:59,802 --> 01:40:08,202
sister, he goes about like a
vagabond!

1191
01:40:08,203 --> 01:40:10,803
He is a totally shamless.

1192
01:40:10,803 --> 01:40:15,003
As his mother have
you ever given him two slaps ...

1193
01:40:15,004 --> 01:40:22,404
..and taught him anything?
If he was my son, I would ...

1194
01:40:22,405 --> 01:40:25,205
have shot him, or
shot myself and died.

1195
01:40:28,006 --> 01:40:32,806
If you have some self respect,
go and put him on path, or ...

1196
01:40:32,807 --> 01:40:35,407
take poison and die.
Go now from here.

1197
01:40:51,108 --> 01:40:55,408
In this serial, we never thought
such an episode will come.

1198
01:40:56,409 --> 01:40:59,409
That Badriprasad will behave
like this, this too we never ...

1199
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:04,010
thought possible. Will Raja accept
all this, we will see in ...

1200
01:41:04,011 --> 01:41:08,811
the next episode  of The Love
Of Shalu. We people.

1201
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:19,412
Where is that old man
who insulted my mother.

1202
01:41:20,613 --> 01:41:24,413
If you have drunk your
mother's milk, come out!

1203
01:41:30,314 --> 01:41:36,414
You insulted my mother, take out
your mother, I will insult her.

1204
01:41:37,415 --> 01:41:42,215
Your dreams cannot be fulfilled,
she is dead for last 20 years.

1205
01:41:42,216 --> 01:41:46,416
And if you say anything against
my mother, I will bury you ...

1206
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:54,717
... alive right here!
Got hurt, isn't it?

1207
01:41:56,618 --> 01:42:03,618
For a mother, who died 20 years ago,
you felt hurt. My mom is alive

1208
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:10,719
You insulted her. How she must
have suffered. Can you imagine?

1209
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:15,720
Now what should I call you?
Raja please ...

1210
01:42:15,721 --> 01:42:23,321
You keep quiet. Don't utter a word.
You are taking his side.

1211
01:42:23,322 --> 01:42:27,122
I have no relation with you.
I have just met a lawyer.

1212
01:42:28,223 --> 01:42:31,723
He has told me if the marriage
is not consummated in six months ...

1213
01:42:31,724 --> 01:42:36,124
then a divorce can be obtained.
I want a divorce.

1214
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:43,025
Yes, I want a divorce.
The matter is over.

1215
01:42:43,626 --> 01:42:44,826
Raja, just listen to me.

1216
01:42:44,827 --> 01:42:47,627
Now whatever has to be said
will be heard in the court.

1217
01:42:49,128 --> 01:42:53,528
Ok, father in law, I am going.
- Raja, what are you saying.

1218
01:42:53,529 --> 01:42:54,529
Hold it.

1219
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:59,630
- Dad, why is he talking like this?

1220
01:43:03,131 --> 01:43:06,931
No, son, no. One doesn't punish a
girl, for her father's mistakes.

1221
01:43:06,932 --> 01:43:09,432
Her father will not correct
himself. When his daughter ...

1222
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:12,933
gets hurt, only then will he come
to his senses.

1223
01:43:19,734 --> 01:43:23,534
Mother, look who is here!
What have you come here for?

1224
01:43:24,735 --> 01:43:27,635
You wanted me to become yours.
See I have come.

1225
01:43:27,636 --> 01:43:31,536
I know your father too well.
I threatened with divorce, so he ...

1226
01:43:31,537 --> 01:43:35,937
has got shaken up. Tell your father,
till he apologises to ...

1227
01:43:35,938 --> 01:43:40,438
my mather i sister, I will not
take his daughter in my home.

1228
01:43:46,139 --> 01:43:52,239
No, daughter, no. Don't cry.
- I have a remedy for my brother.

1229
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:57,340
What is it? - Samosas!
- What? - Yes, samosas.

1230
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:07,441
Be angry later, first
have hot Samosas.

1231
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:11,742
What is mixed in this?

1232
01:44:14,543 --> 01:44:16,243
There are potatoes.

1233
01:44:16,344 --> 01:44:18,844
Potato Samosas. My mother
made them?

1234
01:44:20,245 --> 01:44:21,745
Yes, mother must have
made them.

1235
01:44:24,646 --> 01:44:27,746
Potato!

1236
01:45:25,547 --> 01:45:28,747
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1237
01:45:32,648 --> 01:45:35,848
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1238
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:39,549
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1239
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:42,750
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1240
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:45,951
Shalu will remain stuck with you.

1241
01:45:45,952 --> 01:45:49,152
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1242
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:53,753
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1243
01:46:38,654 --> 01:46:41,554
Without Chutney
the Samosa feel a bore!

1244
01:46:42,155 --> 01:46:45,255
Chutney too will come,
have faith.

1245
01:46:49,056 --> 01:46:52,156
Without Chutney
the Samosa feel a bore!

1246
01:46:52,857 --> 01:46:55,957
Chutney too will come,
have faith.

1247
01:46:56,358 --> 01:46:59,958
I am your idli,
you are my dosa.

1248
01:46:59,959 --> 01:47:02,959
Then let us have one hot dosa!

1249
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,760
No, no, no ...

1250
01:47:06,761 --> 01:47:10,061
Yes, yes, yes ...

1251
01:47:10,562 --> 01:47:13,662
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1252
01:47:13,663 --> 01:47:16,763
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1253
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:20,764
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1254
01:47:20,765 --> 01:47:23,765
Shalu will remain stuck with you.

1255
01:47:24,966 --> 01:47:28,166
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1256
01:47:28,167 --> 01:47:31,167
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1257
01:48:13,068 --> 01:48:16,168
I have fought with
everyone for you.

1258
01:48:16,169 --> 01:48:19,169
Then come quick
and hold my hand.

1259
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:26,670
I have fought with
everyone for you.

1260
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:29,671
Then come quick
and hold my hand.

1261
01:48:30,672 --> 01:48:33,672
My love pulled you here.

1262
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:37,673
You have become my father's
son in law.

1263
01:48:37,674 --> 01:48:41,174
No, no, no ...

1264
01:48:41,175 --> 01:48:44,475
Yes, yes, yes ...

1265
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:47,676
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1266
01:48:47,677 --> 01:48:50,777
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1267
01:48:51,778 --> 01:48:54,978
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1268
01:48:54,979 --> 01:48:57,979
Shalu will remain stuck with you.

1269
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:02,380
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1270
01:49:02,381 --> 01:49:05,781
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1271
01:49:06,382 --> 01:49:09,582
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1272
01:49:09,583 --> 01:49:12,583
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1273
01:49:13,384 --> 01:49:16,584
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1274
01:49:16,585 --> 01:49:19,585
Shalu will remain stuck with you.

1275
01:49:20,686 --> 01:49:23,886
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...

1276
01:49:23,887 --> 01:49:26,887
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.

1277
01:49:58,888 --> 01:50:01,088
Brother. Sister in law's
father has come.

1278
01:50:03,789 --> 01:50:07,789
Look, mother come quickly.
The old man has came.

1279
01:50:09,890 --> 01:50:12,190
Just move.
Let me see him.

1280
01:50:15,491 --> 01:50:19,491
Tulsibhai, Keshavbhai,
Sadiq uncle, come over.

1281
01:50:24,392 --> 01:50:27,692
How did you come here?
- Not walking, but a car.

1282
01:50:30,693 --> 01:50:33,293
Should we go inside and talk?
- Whatever you want to talk ...

1283
01:50:33,294 --> 01:50:34,294
say it openly in front of all.

1284
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:38,795
Ok, if you want it this way, it
is your choice. Give it to him.

1285
01:50:38,796 --> 01:50:42,596
What is it, an apology?
- Can't read, I understand.

1286
01:50:49,597 --> 01:50:53,297
Just now, we have come to
know, on Wednesday on full ...

1287
01:50:53,298 --> 01:50:56,398
moon, Mr Badriprasad is
going to get married.

1288
01:50:58,099 --> 01:50:59,999
Congratulations
- You are already married.

1289
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:03,000
Sorry for the interruption.
Mr Badriprasad's daughter ...

1290
01:51:03,001 --> 01:51:06,301
is getting married. The people are
requested to come and bless ...

1291
01:51:06,302 --> 01:51:08,102
Shalu on the occasion.

1292
01:51:08,303 --> 01:51:11,303
How can you get my
daughter in law married?

1293
01:51:11,704 --> 01:51:14,004
She was, but is not now.

1294
01:51:14,005 --> 01:51:16,405
Brother, keep the respect of two families in mind.

1295
01:51:16,706 --> 01:51:18,606
My brother in law has no self respect,
so don't worry about his.

1296
01:51:19,707 --> 01:51:23,207
Brother, listen to me. Don't
take such a big step.

1297
01:51:23,208 --> 01:51:25,808
Already taken Sister.
- But it can halt ...

1298
01:51:25,809 --> 01:51:29,009
... if even one minute before the
marriage, son in law brings ...

1299
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:33,510
... Rs 100 000 and gives it. Then he
can take my dauther. Isn't it?

1300
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:40,211
Ok, if not, my daughter will
become a wife somewhere else.

1301
01:51:42,912 --> 01:51:44,212
You can not do this.
- Remove your hand.

1302
01:51:44,213 --> 01:51:46,513
You are again taking a child's
life. We are alredy married.

1303
01:51:46,514 --> 01:51:51,014
Which child?
- A real infant.

1304
01:51:53,515 --> 01:51:54,515
I will kill him.

1305
01:51:55,616 --> 01:52:00,516
Come on, thow one lakh on his face
and get my daughter in law.

1306
01:52:00,517 --> 01:52:03,517
Don't worry mom. I will give
him a kick also.

1307
01:52:03,518 --> 01:52:06,418
Mother, there is absolutely
no reason for you to worry.

1308
01:52:06,419 --> 01:52:12,419
In two hours only see how
fortunes change with the stars.

1309
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:17,820
He will bring back your daughter
in law in the same very vehicle.

1310
01:52:18,821 --> 01:52:22,121
With all this talk of astrology,
you have spoiled my brother.

1311
01:52:22,122 --> 01:52:24,922
You keep quiet. You don't
know how much I love him.

1312
01:52:27,823 --> 01:52:32,123
Stop taking those wet
kisses. - Ok come.

1313
01:52:34,124 --> 01:52:36,724
Uncle, just have this
cheque delivered to Raja.

1314
01:52:36,725 --> 01:52:40,025
He should take out the
money and give to Daddy.

1315
01:52:40,026 --> 01:52:43,526
Come, give me that cheque.

1316
01:52:49,127 --> 01:52:52,127
Daddy, don't I have even this much
right to take 1 lakh.

1317
01:52:53,828 --> 01:52:58,628
Only 1 lakh? All this house, this
money is all yours. If you want ...

1318
01:52:58,629 --> 01:53:01,929
.... put the whole thing on fire.
I will not say a word. But if you ...

1319
01:53:01,930 --> 01:53:08,130
... give even a penny to that
wastrel, there would be none ...

1320
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:15,131
worse than me. I got you married to him.
But a man ...

1321
01:53:15,132 --> 01:53:19,932
who can't even earn one lakh
how can he keep you happy!

1322
01:53:23,633 --> 01:53:27,833
But if still you want to give him,
here is your cheque book, ...

1323
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:29,334
... do what you want.

1324
01:53:38,035 --> 01:53:40,835
Uncle!
- Father!

1325
01:53:44,136 --> 01:53:47,036
No, not today.

1326
01:53:52,637 --> 01:53:57,337
Here, take this 1 lakh.
Bring Sister in law home.

1327
01:53:57,338 --> 01:53:58,438
Where did you get
this money from?

1328
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:00,139
You have no concern with that.

1329
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:02,540
I will give you one!
Where did you get the money.

1330
01:54:03,041 --> 01:54:06,941
Brother. if a woman sets out
to make money, it does not take ..

1331
01:54:06,942 --> 01:54:09,742
her much time. - How dare you
talk nonsense in front of me!

1332
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:13,743
You evil woman, just because
you are not married, does not ..

1333
01:54:13,744 --> 01:54:15,944
... mean you blacken your face
anywhere and make money.

1334
01:54:16,645 --> 01:54:22,145
What have I done? You want to
know where I got money from?

1335
01:54:22,146 --> 01:54:24,346
Yes, from where?
Speak from where?

1336
01:54:24,347 --> 01:54:26,547
Ok, listen then. Please
sir come inside.

1337
01:54:32,648 --> 01:54:36,648
You will marry this rascal?
- He hasn't forced himself on me.

1338
01:54:38,549 --> 01:54:42,249
When she told me you don't have
the strength to earn money, and ...

1339
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:47,650
... you haven't money even to bring
your wife, I said I will give.

1340
01:54:48,651 --> 01:54:52,051
For one lakh Kiran is
certainly not bad.

1341
01:54:54,052 --> 01:54:57,452
Take your money and scram from here.

1342
01:54:57,453 --> 01:55:01,053
You come next time, I will
cut you into pieces.

1343
01:55:18,854 --> 01:55:23,454
Sister, you have awakened my
lost conscience.

1344
01:55:26,155 --> 01:55:28,255
I know why you did
all this drama.

1345
01:55:33,256 --> 01:55:39,556
Don't worry. I will get you married.
You also see, mother.

1346
01:55:40,457 --> 01:55:42,257
Why lakhs, I will
earn in millions.

1347
01:55:43,558 --> 01:55:50,558
I will get you married.
Don't worry.

1348
01:55:57,259 --> 01:55:59,559
You want a job? You are Seth
Badriprasad's son in law.

1349
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:05,660
That is why? Otherwise we
were living quite comfortably.

1350
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:10,961
Give me a job. I need a job.

1351
01:56:10,962 --> 01:56:14,262
You get me the job.

1352
01:56:14,263 --> 01:56:18,163
Nephew, this man knows the old
man very well. He won't help.

1353
01:56:18,164 --> 01:56:20,564
You lower your hands.
Come nephew.

1354
01:56:23,565 --> 01:56:26,865
See here are my degrees.
I came first here.

1355
01:56:32,566 --> 01:56:38,866
Raja, excuse me, I am in  a hurry.
Preparation for the marriage ...

1356
01:56:38,867 --> 01:56:42,767
are underway.  I have to go.

1357
01:56:52,368 --> 01:56:57,268
Why do you need work? You only
said after 1 year I will be king.

1358
01:56:58,269 --> 01:57:00,269
Please forget that,
my eyes are opened now.

1359
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:04,770
But if they close again, as
a king you will hang us.

1360
01:57:04,771 --> 01:57:08,271
How can we have the
audacity to offer you a job?

1361
01:58:30,772 --> 01:58:37,872
What will happen,
when I get a job?

1362
01:58:37,872 --> 01:58:44,572
What will happen,
when I get a job?

1363
01:58:44,573 --> 01:58:49,073
I will have a tie on my body
and on my feet will be shoes.

1364
01:58:49,074 --> 01:58:53,974
I will have a tie on my body
and on my feet will be shoes.

1365
01:58:53,975 --> 01:58:57,675
And in my hands will be
the hand of a fair one.

1366
01:58:57,676 --> 01:59:02,176
I will have a tie on my body
and on my feet will be shoes.

1367
01:59:02,177 --> 01:59:05,877
And in my hands will be
the hand of a fair one.

1368
01:59:06,678 --> 01:59:13,378
What will happen,
when I get a job?

1369
01:59:13,379 --> 01:59:17,879
I will have a tie on my body
and on my feet will be shoes.

1370
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,580
And in my hands will be
the hand of a fair one.

1371
02:00:06,781 --> 02:00:11,381
When I put on a suit,
I will be praised.

1372
02:00:11,382 --> 02:00:15,882
The world would say,
Wow! You are great!

1373
02:00:20,983 --> 02:00:25,583
When I put on a suit,
I will be praised.

1374
02:00:25,584 --> 02:00:30,084
The world would say,
Wow! You are great!

1375
02:00:30,385 --> 02:00:35,085
Then just understand folks
my life will be made!

1376
02:00:35,086 --> 02:00:40,086
In no time,
I will get a wife.

1377
02:00:42,387 --> 02:00:47,087
Sometimes in London
girl will say Hello.

1378
02:00:47,088 --> 02:00:51,688
Sometimes the American girl
will say walk with me.

1379
02:00:51,689 --> 02:00:56,189
But I am an Indian, having
consumed the Gange's water ...

1380
02:00:56,190 --> 02:01:01,190
My heart is set ablaze
by the local girl.

1381
02:01:01,191 --> 02:01:04,091
ablaze
by the local girl.

1382
02:01:04,092 --> 02:01:10,792
What will happen,
when I get a job?

1383
02:01:10,793 --> 02:01:15,293
I will have a tie on my body
and on my feet will be shoes.

1384

I will have a tie on my body
and on my feet will be shoes.

1385
02:01:20,195 --> 02:01:23,895
And in my hands will be
the hand of a fair one.

1386
02:02:09,596 --> 02:02:13,696
Somebody will say
'Greetings Sir'

1387
02:02:13,697 --> 02:02:18,697
Somebody will say
'I bow to you'

1388
02:02:23,198 --> 02:02:28,498
Somebody will say
'Greetings Sir'

1389
02:02:28,499 --> 02:02:33,499
Somebody will say
'I bow to you'

1390
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:37,800
Somebody will ask
What is your name?

1391
02:02:37,801 --> 02:02:43,101
Everybody will have work with me.

I will have a bungalow
I will have a car too.

1395
02:02:58,805 --> 02:03:03,505
The key to my destiny,
will be with me only.

1396
02:03:03,506 --> 02:03:06,206
... will be with me only.

1397
02:03:06,807 --> 02:03:11,507
What will happen,
when I get a job?

1398
02:03:11,507 --> 02:03:13,507
I will have this!

1399
02:03:13,508 --> 02:03:15,208
I will have a tie on my body

1400
02:03:18,309 --> 02:03:20,209

1404
02:03:58,813 --> 02:04:03,513
Hey, you had come for a job?
Did you get it?

1405
02:04:04,614 --> 02:04:08,314
I will just remaind you, tomorrow
is Shalu's marriage.

1406
02:04:08,315 --> 02:04:11,015
If you can arrange the RS 100 000
COME TO TAKE YOUR SHALU.

1407
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:16,016
And if not, come to have
food with the guests.

1408
02:04:29,017 --> 02:04:32,217
Come Raja. Did you
manage to get one lakh rupees?

1409
02:04:36,518 --> 02:04:39,518
Anyway, congratulations.
Tomorrow your wife is getting married.

1410
02:04:40,519 --> 02:04:42,519
Have you forgotten the
beating I gave you last time.

1411
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,120
You have strenght? Ok I will
give you 5 lakhs.

1412
02:04:48,121 --> 02:04:50,521
My friend, who is a Sumo wrestler has
just come from America.

1413
02:04:50,522 --> 02:04:54,022
Fight him and win.
You will get Rs 500 000.

1414
02:04:59,523 --> 02:05:00,523
This kid, will he fight?

1415
02:05:00,524 --> 02:05:04,424
Why not? If he loves Shalu a lot,
he will fight anybody.

1416
02:05:05,225 --> 02:05:09,425
Sumo wrestler has finished three.
Now is it his turn.

1417
02:05:22,426 --> 02:05:25,326
Nephew, from his face he
looks like mu younger brother.

1418
02:05:25,327 --> 02:05:28,427
The only difference is perhaps
I am more fat than him!

1419
02:05:28,428 --> 02:05:31,628
You are joking! That man
is marrying off my Shalu.

1420
02:05:31,629 --> 02:05:33,929
And I want Rs 100 000 to get
the marriage stopped.

1421
02:05:33,930 --> 02:05:36,630
Only he can solve
the problem of money.

1422
02:05:36,631 --> 02:05:37,631
How is that?

1423
02:05:37,632 --> 02:05:40,832
Whoever wins him will
earn five lakhs. I suggest ...

1424
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:44,633
... you fight him. Till then
I will delay Shalu's marriage.

1425
02:05:45,234 --> 02:05:47,534
How? - If you extend your
ears, only then can I tell.

1426
02:05:56,035 --> 02:05:59,335
Uncle, stop this kissy business.
All the time you want to kiss.

1427
02:06:00,136 --> 02:06:01,936
Go fight then. Go.
- Yes I will fight.

1428
02:06:01,937 --> 02:06:04,537
Fight me, and fight with him also.

1429
02:06:53,538 --> 02:07:00,538
You have just seen, how my
friend Strongman finished two men.

1430
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:05,339
But there anybody who can
fight with my friend and...

1431
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:10,940
... beat him and win.
Winner will get ...

1432
02:07:10,941 --> 02:07:19,141
.... 5 lakhs. Whoever has got the guts, come down.

1433
02:07:19,142 --> 02:07:21,342
I will fight this black Strong man.

1434
02:07:23,743 --> 02:07:27,143
I will fight.
- Come down.

1435
02:07:29,444 --> 02:07:31,144
I am coming Fatso.

1436
02:07:40,145 --> 02:07:42,545
Hail the Lord!

1437
02:07:46,246 --> 02:07:48,446
I have come to fight putting
my life at risk.

1438
02:07:48,447 --> 02:07:52,847
For five lakhs take 4 and give me 1.
Understood.

1439
02:07:52,848 --> 02:07:55,848
Ne is the one. Kill him.

1440
02:08:01,449 --> 02:08:07,349
Yoa are attacking. I am not fighting
for money but for my wife.

1441
02:08:12,150 --> 02:08:13,850
In gym, you exercise a lot.
Come on fight.

1442
02:08:13,551 --> 02:08:16,051
Where have you got this
bull from?

1443
02:08:19,052 --> 02:08:22,452
Think of one lakh. Your wife
may get married else where.

1444
02:08:28,953 --> 02:08:30,053
Camon Kalu, attack him!

1445
02:08:53,754 --> 02:08:55,054
Here see this!

1446
02:09:26,055 --> 02:09:28,055
I will bite his back side.

1447
02:09:33,056 --> 02:09:35,756
Oh what a thick bull
like skin has he got!

1448
02:09:48,057 --> 02:09:51,757
I told you, don't
mess with me.

1449
02:09:59,758 --> 02:10:02,458
Kill him!
- Don't let off any gas.

1450
02:10:23,059 --> 02:10:26,359
What stink you have got?
Don't you bathe?

1451
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:42,360
Oh, I have won. I have beaten him.
Thank you!

1452
02:10:45,061 --> 02:10:50,061
Bull, what are you doing a
strip tease for. Hit him.

1453
02:11:00,162 --> 02:11:07,062
I just needed 1 lakh rupees.
Oh, oh he has hit me.

1454
02:11:20,963 --> 02:11:23,063
Oh, man, what are you doing?

1455
02:11:37,964 --> 02:11:40,064
My God, Elephant foot
is coming down.

1456
02:11:40,565 --> 02:11:41,965
Just got saved.

1457
02:11:42,766 --> 02:11:44,066
Just escaped.

1458
02:11:54,167 --> 02:11:57,567
Get aside. Will you take
a child's life?

1459
02:11:57,768 --> 02:12:01,368
Shalu will get married!
Get aside!

1460
02:12:02,369 --> 02:12:06,669
I will press your stomach.

1461
02:12:12,670 --> 02:12:15,670
Saved. Saved again.

1462
02:12:24,071 --> 02:12:26,471
You do so much of exercise.
Can't you fight with one man?

1463
02:12:26,472 --> 02:12:28,972
What happened to the 1 lakh you
have to give your father in law.

1464
02:12:31,373 --> 02:12:35,473
Your wife must be getting
married now. Now what will happen ...

1465
02:12:35,474 --> 02:12:37,274
Boss I have an idea.

1466
02:12:37,275 --> 02:12:38,875
What is it?
- Marry his wife.

1467
02:12:38,876 --> 02:12:41,576
Why should I?
But the idea is not bad!

1468
02:12:41,577 --> 02:12:44,477
But in 1 lakh rupees, his wife
is not bad!

1469
02:13:44,278 --> 02:13:47,478
Where are you going, Mr Black
Stongman! Take this.

1470
02:13:55,479 --> 02:13:58,979
I have won.

1471
02:14:00,580 --> 02:14:01,980
Brothers, I have won!

1472
02:14:11,181 --> 02:14:19,981
Wait, listen to me. I don't want
5 lakhs, I only want 1 lakh, ..

1473
02:14:19,982 --> 02:14:29,482
to bring my wife. You can use the
rest to repair this fat man.

1474
02:14:31,483 --> 02:14:36,383
I am going, buy some good clothes.
Don't around naked like this.

1475
02:14:37,184 --> 02:14:40,684
Shalu! Where are my clothes? I have to go.

1476
02:14:48,385 --> 02:14:53,685
Shalu. Look, I have brought one lakh.

1477
02:14:56,086 --> 02:15:00,686
Nephew, you are late.

1478
02:15:01,887 --> 02:15:05,587
Not late, but too late, uncle.

1479
02:15:07,388 --> 02:15:14,088
Father in law, the fault is mine.
God dave such a good girl.

1480
02:15:14,089 --> 02:15:19,489
But I was not bothered. Instead
of working, I just dreamt of

1481
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:21,490
...become a king.

1482
02:15:26,191 --> 02:15:31,091
I am happy you have realised the
value of labor and efforts.

1483
02:15:31,092 --> 02:15:34,292
What is the use now.
It is too late.

1484
02:15:34,293 --> 02:15:39,393
It is not too late.
Your Shalu is there.

1485
02:15:40,094 --> 02:15:41,394
See there!

1486
02:15:44,695 --> 02:15:45,995
Then who is this?

1487
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:55,396
Yes son. This proposal was
arrenged by your father in law.

1488
02:15:55,397 --> 02:15:57,797
And he arrenged for
the entire expenses.

1489
02:15:58,198 --> 02:16:01,398
You thought I will
remarry my daughter?

1490
02:16:01,399 --> 02:16:06,599
All this drama was to open your eyes
and you realise the value ...

1491
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:08,400
... of life and come out of your
life of dreams and not to ...

1492
02:16:08,401 --> 02:16:10,601
... ever fall for the words
of these astrologers.

1493
02:16:10,602 --> 02:16:13,902
But sir, my prophesies are all
turninig out to be true.

1494
02:16:14,403 --> 02:16:15,903
Raja has already becoming a
holder of Rs 100 000.

1495
02:16:15,904 --> 02:16:18,904
After you accept him he will become
a millionaire.

1496
02:16:18,905 --> 02:16:21,905
I mean to say Raja will become a Maharaja!

1497
02:16:22,306 --> 02:16:23,106
Just tell me one thing.

1498
02:16:23,307 --> 02:16:24,707
Will you go from this assembly
after eating your food, or after ...

1499
02:16:25,008 --> 02:16:25,908
... getting beaten with shoes!

1500
02:16:29,109 --> 02:16:32,309
Father in law, your one lakh.

1501
02:16:33,310 --> 02:16:35,310
A gift from your brother's side.

1502
02:16:38,311 --> 02:16:40,011
Uncle, don't kiss
around like this.

1503
02:16:40,012 --> 02:16:41,212
I will kiss you a second time.

1504
02:16:43,413 --> 02:16:47,113
Uncle, I have to celebrate the
bridal night with Shalu.

1505
02:16:47,114 --> 02:16:48,714
Get aside, everybody.

1506
02:16:51,715 --> 02:16:56,115
I have got my Shalu.

1507
02:16:57,616 --> 02:16:59,616
I have to celebrate the
bridal night

1508
02:17:15,417 --> 02:17:17,617
What happened daughter?

1509
02:17:19,418 --> 02:17:21,518
So you saw the play of
Mr and Mrs Player.

1510
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:24,819
Raja has been accepted by
Badriprasad as his son in law.

1511
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:27,320
And Raja has enjoyed his
bridal night.

1512
02:17:27,321 --> 02:17:29,521
Will Raja have a son or a daughter ...

1513
02:17:29,522 --> 02:17:31,822
Those people will see and
not We people.

1514
02:17:36,823 --> 02:17:37,823
You haven't gone as yet?

1515
02:17:37,824 --> 02:17:43,224
Get up! Let those of the next
show come! gO! gO PLEASE!
