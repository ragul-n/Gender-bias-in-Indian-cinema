I have only one question for you. Why are you trying to kill me?

202
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:53,083
If you didn't answer me in one minute, I am going to kill your Son.

207
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,416

Printf software company MD.

Why is he trying to kill me?

210
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,957
Swear on god, I don't know.

211
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:17,208
May be old grudge on you. He helped me once, So I was trying to help him.

212
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,791
How can I believe you?

213
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:25,082
Search for Adarsh Anandrao in my facebook friend list, you will get to know.

214
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,291
Sir what do you need?

220
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,083
Sir one second, ACP sir is calling me.

221
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:16,124
ACP sir.

222
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Ragavendra??

223
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:31,041
I haven't seen Adarsh till now. Why is he having grudge on me?

224
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,208
You will get to know. I'll meet my Editor.

225
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,833
I will show him ACP's call recording and will explain him.

226
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:39,166
Ok.

227
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,416
For now you stay here itself. Keep this mobile.

228
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:48,999
If they ask you to come, I will give you a call. Now go and get refreshed.

229
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,624
Adarsh, I found out both of them.

230
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:01,291
I have updated their location to Surya. They are on the way to that location.

231
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,250
You dont worry. Suresh and Raghu will be caught.

232
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,291
Who are you? I will shoot you, Move.

233
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,583
Why are you people behind my friend?

234
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,666
Because he has killed innocents by exploding bombs.

235
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,875
He is a Terrorist. His real name is Abdul Razzak.

236
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,832
No it's lie. I won't believe.

237
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:59,958
I dont care about your belief, make a call and get him here.

238
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,374
Let us consider him as a Terrorist, hand over him to Police.

239
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:07,541
Court will punish him. Who are you to punish him?

240
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:14,082
We are real Patriots. We don't believe in this Court and Law.

241
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,291
But Suresh is not a Terrorist.

242
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:20,457
Mostly you people have mistook him with someone else.

243
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,750
See, you are Innocent.

244
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,958
I don't have any intention to kill you.

245
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:29,666
But, if you try to save a terrorist I might have to kill you also.

246
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:30,666
Call him.

247
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,416
Put on loud speaker.

248
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:53,166
Yes, Raaghu

249
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:56,124
Suresh, I spoke to my Editor about you.

250
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:00,166
You will be interviewed in a secret place. You have to come there.

251
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,166
Ok. Where should I come?

252
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:10,999
Ok I will be there in 30 minutes.

253
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,416
Give me the phone

254
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:52,707
Hello Raaghu

255
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,708
Hello Raaghu, is it audible ?

256
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,374
Yes, its audible, where are you?

257
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,874
I am near the place you informed, where are you?

258
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:06,208
Don't stand there even for a moment, run, you are in danger

259
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,041
A Sad news, Our channel reporter Raghavendra was killed by two Al-Kahida Terrorists.

260
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:03,166
These two Terrorists are based from Bangladesh,  but settled in Banglore from past 3 years.

261
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:06,707
They are identified as Abhul Razak and Mohammad Rashid.

262
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,833
They were planning for bomb blast in Banglore. Police are in search of these terrorists.

263
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:18,083
Let us interview the Investigation officer ACP Ram.

264
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:23,249
Today evening, Raghavendra met me and gave information related...

265
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,457
...to these Terrorists. Immediately we did a raid on their house.

266
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:30,208
We found a laptop and raw material  for preparing bomb.

267
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:35,791
Going through the laptop confirmed they were from Al-kahida Terrorist group.

268
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:40,250
When We were at their home, they came. Looking at us they started running. We chased them.

269
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,833
We were about to catch them but mean while they fired at us.

270
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:52,457
Those bullets hit the Reporter Rangavendra and he died on the spot.

271
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:57,958
Those 2 terrorists escaped. Even now  our team is in search.

272
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:04,583
My sincere request to public that if you find these Terrorists,  please inform us immediately.

273
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:12,249
Swore on our love, the information telecasting about me on the TV is completly fake.

274
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:17,041
You must believe me. Me and Vinay grew up in same Orphanage.

275
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:20,041
We don't have any connection with Terrorism.

276
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,583
If you have doubt, you can check in the orphanage home where we grew.

277
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,874
You can find many of our childhood photos.

278
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:32,541
I don't know why Adarsh wants to kill me, what benifit he gets!

279
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:36,332
Boss is very angry Surya. By now We should have had caught him.

280
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:42,416
We have searched entire Bangalore sir. We have watsapped his photo to all our known links.

281
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,332
I guees he is hidden somewhere nearby.

282
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:49,332
Is it possible to get his friends information? It will be easy to search.

283
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:55,125
Ok I will speak with my investigation team. Soon I will share you the details.

284
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:56,957
Yes, you are right.

285
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:02,208
If I meet Adarsh, all my questions will be answered. For that I need your help.

286
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:10,041
Adarsh has updated his phone number on Facebook. Using that number we should trace his address.

287
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,124
Ok thank you.

288
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:19,582
Share me his address to this watsapp number. I will be waiting for it.

289
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,791
Are police not searching him Sir?

290
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:24,624
Hmm even they have formed a team and searching him.

291
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:27,458
In case if they catch him, they will handover him to us.

292
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:31,208
I feel he might be hidden in any Mosque.

293
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:37,000
But it's hard to searching him there. We can search him with the help of police.

294
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,666
I will speak with ACP Ram. You continue your search.

295
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,541
If you find him give me a call.

296
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:43,916
Ok sir..

297
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,333
Surya..

298
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,916
Please believe me.

299
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,874
I don't have any grudge on you.

300
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,166
I have done, what my Boss had informed me.

301
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,124
I didn't do any mistake.

302
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:42,499
Who is your Boss ?

303
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:48,791
Vikram... Vikram Vasudev. My company CEO.

304
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,166
Why did your Boss order to kill me?

305
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,333
Tell me Surya your opinion about terrorists.

306
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,750
They are poisonous snakes killing innocent people.

307
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:16,208
What should be done with these snakes?

308
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:17,374
Should be killed Sir.

309
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:22,708
Exactly! but should be torturing before killing.

310
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:26,291
Warning messages should be delivered to their leaders.

311
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:28,875
Innocent people should be saved.

312
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,916
For that, I need your help.

313
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:35,125
Let me know Sir, I am ready.

314
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,833
you should kidnap those Terrorists and handover to us.

315
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:42,708
We will torture them and send a warning message to their Leaders.

316
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,708
We will show our strength.

317
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:49,624
If you need, involve some more patroits like you.

318
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,666
I will pay you all.

319
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:55,499
Will it be possible?

320
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,083
Why not Sir.. I am blessed to do it.

321
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,958
But how do we identify these terrorists?

322
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:05,791
They will be disguised among public.

323
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,541
You don't have to worry about it.

324
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,666
I have a special Intelligent Team.

325
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:16,457
They will find these Terrorists and share their details with us.

326
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:18,374
We will share same to you.

327
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:24,208
You people should watch them carefully and kidnap them  leaving no Trace and handover to us.

328
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,541
I will take care of any legal issues.

329
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:31,958
My boss shared your information as terrorist to me.

330
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:35,833
I forwared the information to my kidnap team. They kidnapped you.

331
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:40,874
Probably our Terrorist Investigation Team got wrong information about you.

332
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,791
Hmmm.. To which association you are working for?

333
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:49,083
No associations, my Boss is a Patriot.

334
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:52,166
Then why are you targeting Muslims?

335
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:57,291
No, we are not targeting Muslims. Infact, We have Muslims in our Team too.

336
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:01,666
According to us, all Muslims are not Terrorists, all terrorists are not Muslims.

337
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:06,666
We can find Terrorists in all Religions. People who kill Innocents are Terrorists.

338
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,666
Let them be from any Religion,  they are our target.

339
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:13,082
We are not against any religion nor supporting any religion.

340
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,666
Why did you kill my friends?

341
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:18,458
No What mistake did they do?

342
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:20,166
I didn't kill your friends.

343
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:20,749
Then, who killed them ?

344
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:49,457
Your friend has killed my friend.

345
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,749
He should feel my pain.

346
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,875
Sir.. sir.. sir.. please sir.. sir no sir..please sir..

347
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:56,750
I am sorry.

348
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,041
You are in danger.

349
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:07,958
What ever might be your intension, it is wrong. Framing me as Abdul Razak is wrong.

350
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,499
Killing my friends is wrong.

351
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,083
You should be punished for all the crimes you have done.

352
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,708
Why did you inform him everything sir?

353
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,041
No no.. I didn't tell him anything.

354
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,374
Call was not disconnected, I heard everything.

355
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:29,750
Ooo what to do.. he scared me using gun.

356
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,166
Did you forget what Boss has warned?

357
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:33,624
What did he warn?

358
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:37,208
What ever might be the situation, Even if you are in death bed,

359
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:41,541
My name should not be disclosed. By chance if you inform.

360
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,832
I will kill you for sure.

361
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:49,041
I will talk to him.

362
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:00,874
Tell me Surya

363
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:01,625
Hello Sir.

364
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,666
Kill Adarsh

365
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:13,082
Haam..

366
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:17,374
Lets put the blame on Abdul Razak.

367
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,041
Ok sir.

368
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:20,832
Jay.

369
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,375
Surya listen to me.

370
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:30,333
Vikram is not a Patriot as you are thinking We are not killing any Terrorists.

371
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,250
He is misusing you guys for his selfishness.

372
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,583
Please believe me sir...

373
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:11,666
I am not a Terrorist. Infact, I am not a Muslim

374
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:17,208
Allow me to prove it.

375
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,541
Should I eat pork? I will eat and show.

376
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:25,708
Killing innocent fellow like me is not patriotism sir.

377
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,166
Its betrayal to our Nation. Please ..please

378
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:37,582
Open your pant zip.

379
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:39,166
Sir?

380
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:45,791
Open your pant zip and prove you are not a Muslim.

381
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:24,416
You bloody.

382
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:42,833
Sir one minute

383
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,250
He is not Adbul Razak.

384
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,916
In fact, He is not a Muslim.

385
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,958
Just now he proved it. Somewhere something is wrong.

386
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:05,166
Yes you are right he is not Abdul Razak.

387
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:07,833
He is not a muslim too.

388
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,583
Then why did we kidnap him?

389
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,874
Because he is a Naxalite.

390
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,500
Only terrorists are not betrayal of our country...

391
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:30,333
...but also people who born here, grew up here but still rasing against our religion, our culture, rituals are also country betrayals.

392
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,541
Even these betrayals should be killed.

393
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:37,124
What do you say?

394
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,707
Correct sir.. what you said is right

395
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:43,916
Even these people are anti-nationals. These people should be killed.

396
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,291
What next?

397
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:46,208
Don't know

398
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,249
I am thinking..

399
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:17,999
Did you get any idea?

400
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:18,749
Hmm..

401
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:21,791
I need your help for that.

402
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,291
Tell me what can I do?

403
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,749
You have to hack Vikram Vasudev's laptop.

404
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:29,666
We might get some information on his crimes.

405
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,041
Need to hack?

406
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:31,666
Hmmm

407
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:43,625
I am not expert in hacking, as you think. I learnt few simple techniques for my movie script.

408
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:47,458
Using those techniques I dont think, We can hack Vikram's laptop.

409
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:53,041
If his laptop is installed with powerful Firewall, Antivirus then it will be difficult.

410
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:57,958
Why don't you give a try. If it works well and good, else We will think some other options.

411
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:01,874
OK will try. Get refreshed. We will have breakfast

412
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:02,958
Ok

413
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,416
Hello

414
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:25,708
ACP sir, did you get any clue about Suresh?

415
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:29,916
No Vikram. our team is searching for him.

416
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:35,166
If he goes to Media, we will be in Jail.

417
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:38,416
Dont worry he will be caught by today's evening.

418
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:42,833
Hmm ok fine Sir. Inform me as soon as he is caught.

419
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:48,582
Here my team is searching for him. If they catch him, I will inform you.

420
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,666
Ok Vikarm. Be cool.

421
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:51,916
Thank you sir.

422
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:59,374
David, there are many ways to hack. Which method will you try?

423
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:00,958
I will use RAT.

424
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:02,124
RAT means?

425
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:06,750
Remote Access Tool. It is a Software. Using this you can access remote computers.

426
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,791
I mean, if we isntall this RAT Server Software on Vikram Vasudev's laptop,

427
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:15,166
I can access his laptop using RAT client on my laptop.

428
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:22,041
Oo, how to install this RAT software on Vikarm Vasudaev's laptop?

429
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,666
Can install through e-mail.

430
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:24,916
I didn't understand.

431
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:29,624
I will merge this RAT software with a document..

432
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:37,874
...then I'll send this documment via mail to vikram's email id.

433
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:49,750
As soon as he click on that document,

434
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,916
our RAT Server Software will be installed on his laptop without his knowledge.

435
00:58:57,208 --> 00:59:01,708
Then using RAT Client on our laptop, we can access vikram's laptop.

436
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:06,708
Yes

437
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:10,083
Thanks David. Download all.

438
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,041
Ok

439
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,041
I have donwloaded all. Check them out.

440
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:38,666
I think these proofs are sufficant to send him to Jail.

441
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,250
Hmm, life term punishment is gauranteed.

442
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:48,999
But it would be better if We get proof linking ACP Ram and Vikram.

443
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:57,583
Once arrested, Vikarm might disclose about ACP Ram. Anyhow I will search to get any further proof.

444
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:01,583
Ok, send these information to all TV channels.

445
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,333
I dont think its a good idea.

446
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,333
Chances are there for Vikam to escape once these information are telecasted on TV channels.

447
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,624
Better let us send it to Commissioner alone.

448
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:12,499
We will send it to TV channes if no action for taken.

449
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:13,583
OK.

450
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:39,124
Tell me sir

451
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,875
One bad news vikarm.

452
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:42,874
What is it?!

453
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,583
Someone has e-mailed all you criminals activties to Commissioner.

454
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,333
Goddd...

455
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:02,999
Those videos are stored only in my Laptop.

456
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:09,708
No one will touch my Laptop. Also it is Password Protected.

457
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,874
Someone might have hacked?

458
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:12,833
Might be,

459
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:20,166
but who might have done it? hmm was it Suresh?

460
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:21,749
Even I doubt him.

461
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,416
Did Commissioner got to know?

462
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:27,832
No. before he could know I have asked to delete it.

463
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,500
Now what to do sir?

464
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,333
Are there any Hacking Expert in your office?

465
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:38,499
Yes. Rohit.

466
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:56,958
We got him sir.

467
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:06,207
Check if his friend's list has person named Suresh?

468
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:08,624
Sir..

469
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,083
Hmmm as I expected.

470
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:21,374
Hello

471
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:22,208
Sir,

472
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:24,791
got to know who hacked my Laptop.

473
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:25,750
Who?

474
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:29,750
David, He is a friend of Suresh. Now both are together.

475
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:35,625
If we get to know where is David, We can easily catch Suresh.

476
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:40,875
OK OK, We can look into that issue later. Start immediately from where you are.

477
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:42,458
Why sir what happend?

478
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,416
The email was sent to Commissioner's personal email id also.

479
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:52,957
Commissioner is watching all your Crime Videos. Its a very serious case Vikram.

480
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:55,791
Chances of issuing arrest warrant is very high.

481
01:02:56,750 --> 01:03:01,833
For now, you and your team hide in your friend's Garage.

482
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,749
That place is very safe.

483
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:08,875
Stay there untill you get the bail. I will meet your lawyer and discuss.

484
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:14,707
One more thing, leave your car there, and switch off your phones.

485
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:20,499
No one should suspect your hidden place. I will meet you in personal for any important matter.

486
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:21,791
Thank you very much sir.

487
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:26,541
Sir, after analyzing David's Facebook profile, I could make out He is a Film Director.

488
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,916
He is working on a movie based on Hacking.

489
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,957
Means He knows about hacking techniques.

490
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:38,625
Currently he is staying in his Farmhouse and working on a movie script.

491
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,041
He has updated his Farmhouse location.

492
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:50,124
Wow! Suresh, I got a solid proof about the connection between Vikarm and ACP Ram

493
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,000
Is it ? Show it..  See me...

494
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:33,124
Vikram!! Come come..

495
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:47,749
How dare you hack my Laptop?

496
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,458
No..

497
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,166
Where is he?

498
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:54,582
No I dont know,.please.. I dont know,

499
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:58,124
You dont know? You dont know? Please

500
01:06:57,041 --> 01:07:02,041
Criminal Vikram Vasudev has absconded and Police are searching for him

501
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:29,749
We should have killed him when we had a chance.

502
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:33,583
I made a mistake.

503
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,958
Yes sir, you did a big mistake leaving him alive.

504
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,707
ACP Ram sir.

505
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,041
Have a seat Sir.

506
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:38,249
Sir, what are you doing ?

507
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:42,666
Without my knowledge, you had recorded while I was taking bribe !!

508
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:49,791
Arrest warrant is issued in my name also. I will be jailed because of you.

509
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,750
Sir I think its not safe to stay here.

510
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:35,624
What shall we do sir?

511
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:45,916
Lets go to Singapore.

512
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:02,416
Hi to all.

513
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:09,416
I called this Pressmeet to disclose all the crimes committed by Vikram.

514
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:17,041
Then, how I was trapped in this Crime, the difficulties I faced, what all I've lost.

515
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:23,499
I'd already shared all the details and documents to Media via email.

516
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:30,291
I'm not Abdul Razak nor Terrorist. My name is Suresh. I'm a Hardware Engineer.

517
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:40,625
Two days back after completing my work at late night, I was waiting for a cab near a bus stop to go home.

518
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:42,166
Bellandur?

519
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:43,374
Yes it will go, get in.

520
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:12,916
I'm not trying to kill you.

521
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,208
Then who else?

522
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,458
Adarsh AnandRao.

523
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:26,708
I did what my Boss ordered.

524
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:28,083
Who is your boss.

525
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,541
Vikram Vasudev.

526
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,333
Yes,

527
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,541
you are right.

528
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:42,499
he is not Abdul Razak, he is not muslim.

529
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,457
Then why did we kidnap him sir?

530
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:50,707
Because he is a Naxalite..

531
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,666
He killed my Friend.

532
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:18,208
He should not die so easily. He has to get tortured and then die.

533
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:21,166
His death should be useful to us.

534
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:26,624
His leaders have nurture many naxals like him.

535
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:32,208
They are killing Police. They should learn the value of life.

536
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:40,583
I will inform them. They will watch his death in live.

537
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,916
Surya, you both go and search Adarsh.

538
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,499
definately he will go to the Police.

539
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:50,624
Before that I want him Dead or Alive.

540
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,416
Let him be here till tomorrow night.

541
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,083
We will show him how the hell looks.

542
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:26,041
Handsup.

543
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:06,749
Thanks

544
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:10,749
Infact I should thank you

545
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,375
Please, tell me the truth now.

546
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:21,457
What was that urgent matter?

547
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:24,874
Why are you upset?

548
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:25,833
Love failure.

549
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:28,624
Why? Didn't she agree to marry you?

550
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:30,916
Hmm..

551
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:33,999
She is in love with some one else.

552
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:36,457
She is willing to marry him.

553
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,999
shall I elope her?

554
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:40,207
I don't want to marry her forcefully.

555
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,833
How will you forget her?

556
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:43,499
I won't forget.

557
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,458
I will lead a lavish life in front of her.

558
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,832
She ditched me because she is rich.

559
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:55,499
I have to earn more than she has.

560
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:59,249
She should feel jealous of my richness.

561
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:04,041
I am not getting profit from my software company.

562
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:08,749
I cant relay on this company to fulfill my aim.

563
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:14,707
So I am planning to start an illegal business.

564
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:15,833
What business?

565
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:16,999
Drugs business.

566
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,083
DRUGS?!!!

567
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:22,166
For a quick earn I don't find any other better way.

568
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,916
OK how can I help you?

569
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,749
I will get drugs from foreign.

570
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:32,207
You have to use yous boys to deliver them directly to the consumers.

571
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,666
You will get your share in profit.

572
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:40,332
But this is very difficult work Vikarm. The team already in drug business will not allow us to do it.

573
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:42,166
You don't worry Krishna.

574
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:47,666
We are not doing this business in Underworld, but in Cyber Underworld.

575
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:54,791
No one can make out who is supplying, who is ordering or who is delivering.

576
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,375
every one will be anonymous.

577
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,666
what is Cyber Underworld?

578
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,875
This Cyber Underworld is a part of internet.

579
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:06,958
Technically it is called Deepweb or Darknet.

580
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:15,499
The internet we all use in general is called Surface Web.

581
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:21,416
Users who access these websites can be traced out by Police easily.

582
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:25,041
So cyber criminals cant escape here.

583
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:28,083
But this surface web is only 5%...

584
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:33,416
...Remaining 95% internet is cyber underworld !!!

585
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:37,999
Our identity will be anonymous as soon as we connect to this Deepweb.

586
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,958
No one can trace our identity. No one can trace out the server locations.

587
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:50,749
Since this Deepweb is so secured, Many scary crimes are happening here.

588
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:57,499
If you need further info search for Deepweb or Darknet in google.

589
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,916
You will understand better.

590
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,625
OK, I still din't understand it clearly. I'll google and will find it out.

591
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:07,499
But how to do this drug business in Deepweb?

592
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:09,416
Adarsh

593
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:15,166
We have launched our own website in this Deepweb. Its called Smoothroad.

594
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:19,666
It is just like Flipkart, Amazon but this is a Black Market site.

595
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:24,000
Here you get only illegal goods including drugs.

596
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:30,207
We shall sell all the drugs at low price because We don't have to pay for Middle Men.

597
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:32,749
Consumers will access the website.

598
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:40,166
After registering themself to this website  they will place the order for the drugs.

599
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:50,541
Your boys should deliver those drugs to the mentioned address.

600
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:33,666
But no one should make out who and from where these drugs are supplied.

601
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:37,332
Sir, how will the drug consumers enter into this Deepweb?

602
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:42,291
I feel, its not safe to explain here about how they enter.

603
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:45,625
Because many people are watching me.

604
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,333
My aim is to bring up an awareness about Deepweb to common people and but not to give ideas to the Criminals.

605
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:55,624
I too have social responsibility. Hope you understand.

606
01:18:56,208 --> 01:19:04,374
I want to expose information about Cyber Underworld and the scary crimes happening inside it to the common people.

607
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:06,999
They will take the precautions that is needed.

608
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:10,082
How will the consumers do the payment for the drugs they have ordered?

609
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:11,541
Through Online transfer.

610
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:16,041
That means we can easily make out the bank account from where amount was credited right?

611
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:19,457
Then how will it be anonymous?

612
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:25,208
They are not transfering Indian currency but BITCOIN. It is a Digital Currency.

613
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:27,416
This currency doesn't belongs to any country.

614
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,291
BITCOIN??

615
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:29,874
I am not able to understand it.

616
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:34,916
Krishna you don't worry about the bitcoin. I will give your share in cash only.

617
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:39,250
That drugs should be delivered to the correct address with no interrupts.

618
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:41,208
Will it be possible?

619
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:42,457
Yes it is possible.

620
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:51,083
This drug business was running fine for few months.

621
01:19:57,333 --> 01:20:03,791
But one day, four delivery boys working under Krishna flew away with 10 Crore Drugs.

622
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:24,666
Hello

623
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,291
What??

624
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:38,999
10 crores worth drugs Krishna!!!

625
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,416
Its not a joke.

626
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:52,416
What ever it is, I need those drugs back. Your boys who robbed drugs should die.

627
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:06,750
At last We got our drugs back. Three boys elopped. One fellow was caught.

628
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:13,499
We tortured him and killed. I recorded and sent it to my Boss.

629
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,500
I was watching this video.

630
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:24,791
I got a brilliant idea to make money in a quick way.

631
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:25,749
What is that idea?

632
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,125
RED ROOM!!!

633
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:29,291
RED ROOM!?? What is that?!

634
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:34,582
RED ROOM is a reality show in internet where humans are tortured and murdered.

635
01:21:35,083 --> 01:21:38,999
In this program they will torture the humans. Finally they are killed.

636
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:44,957
This program is live streamed in one of the website in Deepweb.

637
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:49,666
Since this show is in deepweb, its not possible to get the information about

638
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:53,916
the location where this program is shot, who is conducting this show,

639
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:57,499
the server which is streaming this video, and the audience who are watching this show.

640
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:03,666
Since you said they earn lot of money, So audience need to pay to watch it right?

641
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:06,457
Exactly! Usually Audience are Rich.

642
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:10,666
They will be in some country in their private place and watching this show.

643
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:14,666
Its unbelivable. Do such people exist to watch such program?

644
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,291
Yes sir.

645
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:18,458
Usually they are Psychopaths.

646
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:24,125
They will have distorted mind to watch people getting tortured in live.

647
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:28,541
These people will pay in bitcoin and register to such websites.

648
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:31,999
This show will be started at the announced time.

649
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:38,083
These psycos will have live chat with show organizers.

650
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:47,708
They will convey which body part has to be deformed.

651
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:49,332
Right hand wrist

652
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:55,541
Organizers will deform that part in the show. Psycos will enjoy watching this.

653
01:22:56,166 --> 01:23:00,624
Different price for Deforming different parts. More price for killing to death.

654
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,625
O MY GOD. can't belive.  Do such Psycos exist?

655
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:07,416
Mmm

656
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:13,166
Its an entertainment for them. They are ready to pay any amount for this show.

657
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:15,666
How will these psycos come to know about our show?

658
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:17,499
How to find these psycos?

659
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:18,958
there are many ways.

660
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:23,958
You dont need to worry about it. you both should run this show.

661
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:27,458
Both of you will get good share.

662
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,416
what do you say?

663
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,458
I am OK.

664
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:33,416
Adarsh?

665
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:36,375
I am also OK..

666
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:39,666
but whom will we torture and kill in this show?

667
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:41,916
We will be torturing ORPHANS.

668
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:46,958
Even if they go missing, no one should be there to complaint about their missing.

669
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:50,458
Even if someone gives a compalint, not a problem,

670
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,375
I can handle the Police.

671
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:55,083
Means we need to search those orphans ?

672
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:58,666
You don't have to search. My friend is a Detective.

673
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:03,583
He will do a research on orphans and will share the detail.

674
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:07,541
We will kidnap them and will place in this Redroom show.

675
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,333
But the major challege we have is kidnapping them.

676
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:17,166
For this work, I need 3 or 4 Patriots.

677
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:20,791
They should be anger on Terrorists.

678
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:25,249
Do you know such Fellows Krishna?

679
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:26,458
I know one Guy.

680
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:36,250
Tell me Mr.Surya, your thought about terrorists. I've an intelligent special team.

681
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:40,874
They will search those terrorists and share there information to us.

682
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:42,791
We will share same to you.

683
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:48,666
you should watch them and kidnap them and handover to us with out leaving any clue.

684
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:52,166
You were kidnapped because you are an orphan.

685
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:54,166
Got it.

686
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:58,458
Till now how many orphans have you murdered in RED ROOM?

687
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,833
Approximately 25 to 30.

688
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:07,708
its very Painful that we are misusing this technology.

689
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,416
Is your GPS on?

690
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:06,999
Just for the sake of money they have tortured and killed many innocent people.

691
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,874
They have killed my friends who have not done any mistake.

692
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,500
I request Police to arrest these criminals as soon as possbile.

693
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,374
These criminals should be hanged till death.

694
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:21,541
Even ACP Ram who helped them should be in prisioned till death.

695
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:26,124
I have full hope on our police and judiciary system.

696
01:26:26,916 --> 01:26:29,416
I hope I will get justice. Thank you.

697
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:09,708
Hello

698
01:27:09,916 --> 01:27:10,707
Who are you?

699
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:11,999
Abdul Razak.

700
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,833
OO is it you?

701
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,291
Where did you get his video?

702
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,000
It was in Vikram's laptop.

703
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,124
He has recorded this without your knowledge.

704
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,458
