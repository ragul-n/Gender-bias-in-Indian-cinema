1
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,319
I AM YOURS

2
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,959
My name is Mina.
I am 27 years old.

3
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,839
I'm an actress.
I have a son named Felix.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,439
Hey! Be careful.

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
Check it out.

6
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,039
Looks like you need some more milk,
to make them bigger.

7
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,919
I like to dance. And...

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,239
Play guitar. And read.

9
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,679
-So, are you sure...?
-Definitely. Don't worry about it.

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,959
-I'll be in touch if you get the part.
-Okay.

11
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,439
-Great. Thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,559
Hello, sweetheart, this is your
mother. I miss you so much.

13
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,399
Hello, can you hear me?

14
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,559
-Can't you come tomorrow?
-Felix and I are going swimming.

15
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,039
In water?
Chlorine just makes his skin dry.

16
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,919
Don't be silly.
Come around tomorrow.

17
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,559
Felix needs to know
that his grandmother loves him.

18
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,599
Hello? Can you hear me?

19
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,199
Oh, and bring some sweets with you.
Golab Jamun and Barfi.

20
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,759
See you tomorrow.

21
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,119
-Why don't you want to go to Grandma's?
-Stop nagging!

22
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
I'm so tired of taking medicines.
I don't get any rest anyway.

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,279
-Her back hurts a lot.
-Just her back?

24
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,319
Help Grandma.

25
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,279
-Let me...
-No, it's okay.

26
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,239
If only someone
would take care of me.

27
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,959
No, no.

28
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,879
It's so lovely when you give me
a massage, sweetheart.

29
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,039
You know, young people today...

30
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,719
When they grow up...

31
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,759
They don't take care of
their parents anymore.

32
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,839
-I'll go in and see Grandma.
-Don't wake Grandma!

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,959
You'll just upset her.

34
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,079
She won't listen.

35
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,919
-Tell me, my dear, how are you?
-Fine. And you?

36
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,559
I hear you're not too well.

37
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,399
My back is killing me.

38
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,679
Sweetheart, don't go yet!

39
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,919
I think naprapathy might help.

40
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,559
Forget it. This pain will
bother me for the rest of my life.

41
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,879
Tell me.
This house you designed...

42
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,159
How much did you make from the job?

43
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,879
Well... I'm doing alright.

44
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,519
-Architects are busy these days?
-Sure.

45
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,959
-We're getting by. Right, Felix?
-Sure.

46
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,079
It's been nice, but we have to go.
Say bye to Mummy.

47
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,719
You'll call? I'll give you the number.

48
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,319
See you next week. Bye, sweetheart.

49
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,799
-Come more often. It makes me happy.
-I will.

50
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,439
I'll call you tomorrow.

51
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,039
-Okay?
-Great.

52
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,679
-Felix!
-Bye.

53
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,879
-Bye, Felix.
-Love you, sweetie.

54
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,719
-Remember to come and see me.
-I will.

55
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,159
What a fine man.

56
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,359
Imagine if he were still a member of
the family. That would be wonderful.

57
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,159
He would never have left you, Mina,
if you hadn't flirted with other men.

58
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,759
Don't you agree?

59
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,639
-Did you miss me?
-Yes, I did.

60
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,999
-Sure?
-Did you miss me?

61
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,439
-That little?
-This much!

62
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,919
No, it was...
That casting session I told you about.

63
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,039
-It all went to hell.
-Why?

64
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,799
They all ask such stupid questions.

65
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,919
-They're a different breed.
-You've got that right.

66
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,279
-Screw them.
-Yes.

67
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,599
-What's up?
-Damn it...

68
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,119
Shit, it's my girlfriend.

69
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,319
She has phoned so many times.

70
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,999
We were supposed to
have a Skype meeting.

71
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,039
There's a press conference tomorrow.
She has to prepare for it.

72
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,559
I forgot about it.

73
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,799
-I have to go.
-Now? You just got here!

74
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,959
It was supposed to be now.

75
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,959
The two of you
are going to Skype right now?

76
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,999
-Sorry.
-Okay.

77
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,639
This is... But I've got to...

78
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,079
I have to run, because...
Line will go nuts if I don't.

79
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,839
-Just go, if it's important.
-I'm so sorry.

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,599
-Would you like the wine?
-Yes.

81
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,679
-Looking for something in particular?
-Some sunglasses, maybe.

82
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,919
They're great.
You should try them on.

83
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,879
Look at those!
They're really great.

84
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,719
I won't try to sell you anything,
convert you, -

85
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,359
- or make you my second wife.

86
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,239
-You live in Oslo?
-No. I'm here with my film.

87
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,279
-It opened yesterday at the Festival.
-Did it do well?

88
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,719
A hit.
No. I don't know.

89
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,439
-You're a director?
-Yes. And a screenwriter.

90
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,399
I consider screenwriting
the hardest job in film.

91
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,999
-I'm an actress.
-I knew it.

92
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,919
-You knew it?
-My first thought:

93
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,399
She's an actress! It's true.
On stage, in films...?

94
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,719
It varies.
Right now, I'm making a short film.

95
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,599
-What about?
-A man who turns into a dog.

96
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,799
A man who turns into a dog?
That's brilliant.

97
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,919
-You play the dog?
-No!

98
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,119
-You're starring in it.
-I know it sounds a little weird, but...

99
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,999
-I'll have to see it.
-Yes, maybe.

100
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,599
-Did you see Pinchcliffe Grand Prix?
-Sure. It's a classic.

101
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,919
I saw it today at the Cinematheque.

102
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,239
I love the message.
The whole central intrigue.

103
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,559
Gore-Slimey has worked
for Reodor in the past.

104
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,999
And he's stolen
the Supergizmometer. And then...

105
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,799
Everything changes,
and he becomes World Champion.

106
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,119
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee with me?

107
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,279
You live near here?

108
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,119
-Some gum?
-Yes, please.

109
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,239
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

110
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,239
How about a cup of coffee?
Or a glass of wine? Tea? Pizza?

111
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,319
-I don't eat pizza with strangers.
-Stranger? Me?

112
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,759
We've known each other
for 300 metres.

113
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,959
You're right.

114
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,959
So, how about that cup of coffee?
Or a pizza?

115
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,279
Maybe after 500 metres?

116
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,279
My mother is still angry
that they spent so much money -

117
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
- kidnapping me to Pakistan
when I was 14.

118
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,959
But Dad is just pissed off
because he missed the pools that week.

119
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,239
Because he had to bring me there.
That's their way of thinking.

120
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,039
-Really?
-Yes, but... It was a long time ago.

121
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,119
-What happened?
-Dad went back home.

122
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,559
I lived with these religious relatives
I'd never met before.

123
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,199
-He went home again?
-Yes.

124
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,679
But I did all right.
Learned the language.

125
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,679
The culture.
Blended right in, like a chameleon.

126
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,919
-For real?
-Yes. But it's long ago.

127
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,159
-How come you came back here again?
-I got bored, so...

128
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,519
I made out with a cousin. I don't
usually kiss my relatives, but...

129
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,279
-You made out with your cousin?
-Yes. A real taboo.

130
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,119
And...we got caught.

131
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,559
And then... Oh God!
I'm actually telling you this.

132
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,959
So I was forced to go
back to Norway with Dad.

133
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,039
Now you're looking at me as though
I'm mad, and I should have kept quiet.

134
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,199
-Did I scare you off now?
-No, not at all.

135
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,879
-You're not married?
-No. Not anymore.

136
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,559
-But you have been?
-Yes.

137
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,199
Okay, but you don't have six kids
tucked away somewhere?

138
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,879
-One child?
-Just one kid who bawls "Mummy."

139
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
-Is this your son?
-Yes. Felix.

140
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,519
He's great. Lovely.

141
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,879
-You think he looks like me?
-What's that? American Football...

142
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,759
He does look like you.

143
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,319
-You're beautiful.
-Thanks.

144
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,319
Sexy.

145
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,159
-Want me to read to you?
-Please do.

146
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,079
-Stop it.
-I have to hold on to something!

147
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,759
-I can't find Ibsen!
-Not only Ibsen is buried here.

148
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,719
-All the Norwegian Greats are!
-Yes, but I want to see Ibsen!

149
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,959
-Edvard Munch...
-Is Munch here?

150
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,759
Where are all the artists?

151
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,839
No, stop it!
I'll confiscate it.

152
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,719
Hi.

153
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,639
-Are you tourists?
-Well, sort of.

154
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,279
-No, stop that.
-Look. That's the one.

155
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,919
-Is that Ibsen's grave down there?
-Yes.

156
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,199
Let me see how they turned out.

157
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,599
Let's do it on Ibsen's grave.

158
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,519
No.
They'll throw us out!

159
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,039
-Do you have to leave today?
-I've got to.

160
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,159
You don't really have to, do you?

161
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,999
You have to come to Stockholm.

162
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,279
Should I?

163
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,999
Would you?

164
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,639
-If you behave.
-Of course.

165
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,239
-I always do.
-No! You never do.

166
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,439
Hi, sweetie! Give me a hug!
Oh, I've missed you!

167
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,439
Did you have a nice time?
Sorry, I was held up.

168
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,959
But I've got loads of free time now.
He can spend some extra time with me.

169
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,039
-Let's just stick to our agreements.
-Okay.

170
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,039
-See you soon, pal. Enjoy yourselves.
-Bye, Felix!

171
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,519
-Hungry? Have you had supper?
-No.

172
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,319
I can make you a hot dog.

173
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,199
-You know you can't play with that.
-But I love it.

174
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,399
I know, but it's just for looking at.
Don't touch. Okay?

175
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,119
Tell me the story again.

176
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,679
Okay.
Once upon a time, a long time ago...

177
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,519
Mummy was very ill
in a hospital in Pakistan.

178
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,639
And one fine day,
Grandma came to visit me.

179
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,799
She gave Mummy this elephant.

180
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,919
And just like that,
Mummy got well again!

181
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,639
That's what happened.

182
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,079
I'll make you some food now, okay?

183
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,839
I forgot to go shopping.

184
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,359
Not again!
Here you are. Let's swap.

185
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,759
When will you start
living like a human being?

186
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,319
There's not just you. Your son's
future is bound up with your life.

187
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,039
Can't you even grasp
a simple fact like that?

188
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,359
What's missing in this household?

189
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,319
Why must you occupy yourself
with such disgraceful things?

190
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,959
Aziza's son.
He's a fine young man.

191
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,359
You still have time.
Not everything is totally ruined.

192
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,839
I can arrange for you to marry him.

193
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,439
People will forget everything,
and our life will be easier as well.

194
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,959
Don't you agree?

195
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,799
Try to understand
what your mother is telling you.

196
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,239
-I don't want to get married.
-Listen to her!

197
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,879
You never understand
anything I tell you.

198
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,639
Explain it to her.

199
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,199
You only think about yourself.

200
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,199
Hi!
Most beautiful woman in the world.

201
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,119
-Lovely, lovely you.
-Can't you come to Sweden?

202
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,279
I want to.

203
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,639
-It was so great in Oslo.
-Yes, it was.

204
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,879
This is so frustrating.

205
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,519
Please. Come on over here right away.
Can't you come here?

206
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,599
I want to, but...
I'm looking after Felix right now.

207
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,559
You've got Felix?
That doesn't suit me at all.

208
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,799
-Huh?
-Just kidding!

209
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,279
Just kidding, darling. Bring Felix.
It'll be cool to meet Tarzan.

210
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,399
Well...
Maybe it's a bit too soon.

211
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,279
If I can find a babysitter,
maybe I can come.

212
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,239
Well, okay.
But he's also very much welcome.

213
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,479
-You know that, right?
-Yes.

214
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,919
Imagine if the two of you
could move in with me.

215
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,999
-Maybe. Do you have room for us?
-Yes, there's plenty of room here.

216
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,479
-Come here and see for yourself.
-I'll try.

217
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,559
-Think it over.
-To Sweden...

218
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,039
-Just an idea.
-And it's just around the corner.

219
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,959
I long for you so much,
Come here. Please.

220
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,319
I'll try, I promise you.

221
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,879
-Okay. Take care.
-Bye.

222
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,319
Morning, sweetie. Let's get up.

223
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,639
Felix.

224
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,319
Hey.

225
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,119
Hey...

226
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,439
We're going on a trip today.
You have to get up.

227
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,519
Felix, wake up.

228
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,119
You're going on a trip with Mummy.

229
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,199
-Hey, get up now.
-Where are we going?

230
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,119
To another country. It'll be fun.

231
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,039
We're going to meet a prince.
A prince in another country!

232
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,319
Now the prince has become Mummy's
boyfriend. Isn't that exciting?

233
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,879
We're going to Stockholm
to visit Mummy's boyfriend.

234
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,719
-What's your boyfriend's name?
-Jesper.

235
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,959
-Does he have a car?
-Yes, I think so.

236
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,159
-Is he nice?
-He's really nice.

237
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,639
Really sweet. Just like you.
And he lives in a house.

238
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,319
A yellow house, with lots of rooms.
A playroom for you, and...

239
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,199
Want to play helicopters?

240
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,159
Careful!

241
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,679
Are you having fun, sweetie?

242
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,359
-Want to drive on my arm?
-Yes.

243
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,479
Later.

244
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,599
Go to sleep now.

245
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,799
-Will he be asleep soon?
-Yes. Soon.

246
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,079
-Sleep well, Tarzan.
-Can you say good night to Jesper?

247
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,159
A real bear hug.
Go to sleep now.

248
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,559
I'll wait for you in bed.

249
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,199
You're coming?
I'm longing for you.

250
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,759
Let's make a deal.
If I sing for you...

251
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,919
-Will you promise you'll go to sleep?
-Yes!

252
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,879
Okay, I'll start singing now.

253
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,039
Go to sleep, my little man

254
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,159
Now the day is done

255
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,239
All the mice in all the land
are sleeping, one by one

256
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,439
Hi.

257
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,319
-How wonderful you are.
-At last.

258
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,879
-I've been longing for you.
-I've missed you too.

259
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,199
-I've missed you so much.
-Have you?

260
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,959
-I can't sleep in there.
-Felix...

261
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,079
-I want to sleep here.
-Let's go and lie on the couch.

262
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,879
You have to be quiet.

263
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:52,519
-Where are you going?
-I have to work on my screenplay.

264
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,599
Make yourself at home.
Take whatever you want from the fridge.

265
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,799
Bye.

266
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,759
-Call me.
-All right.

267
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,879
Here.

268
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,039
-What are you doing in Stockholm?
-Visiting my boyfriend.

269
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,599
-But you're not living here?
-Not yet. But I may move here.

270
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,399
This is a low budget film,
so we can't fly you in.

271
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,919
But I'm here so often,
it won't be a problem.

272
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,559
-You're planning to move here?
-Yes.

273
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,319
How long have you been
with your boyfriend?

274
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,039
We've known each other
for a long time, but...

275
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,839
We've had a proper relationship
for a few months.

276
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,799
But this character will speak Swedish.
Do you know some Swedish?

277
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,599
I can give it a shot.

278
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,519
-Go ahead.
-I speak a bit of Swedish.

279
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,559
Happy birthday to you

280
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,959
-Are you going to blow out the candles?
-Happy birthday, dear Felix

281
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,119
Happy birthday to you

282
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,919
Are you going to open your present?
Find out what you've got!

283
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,559
I didn't want to buy
something meaningless.

284
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,959
-I don't know him that well...
-It's fine.

285
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,599
I wanted to wait a while. Later on
I'll buy him something meaningful.

286
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,799
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

287
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,999
I will get him a present
that is significant.

288
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,559
It's fine.
He's got plenty of stuff.

289
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,279
-Batman!
-Look at all these presents!

290
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,239
-And there's Batman!
-Perfect.

291
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,239
-I want to play helicopters.
-Yeah! Do it!

292
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,279
So you want to play helicopters, eh?

293
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,159
-I love you.
-What was that?

294
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,679
-I love you.
-No, you can't say that.

295
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,039
-Felix...
-I love you!

296
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,279
-Listen, Felix...
-I love you!

297
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,479
Felix, this is important.
You can't say that to just anyone.

298
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,039
How about some cake?

299
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,879
How about a quickie?

300
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,039
I don't know. It feels...

301
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,559
Sort of scheduled.

302
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,119
He's busy, so...

303
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,959
-Mummy!
-I'll be right there, sweetie!

304
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,879
One more minute.

305
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,919
-Stupid Mummy. Stupid Jesper!
-Stop it. We're just going for a walk.

306
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,839
-Isn't walking great?
-No, stupid Jesper!

307
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,119
-Let's eat something nice soon.
- No, I want to go home.

308
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,119
-We'll walk a bit first.
-No, stupid!

309
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,639
Come on, now. Behave.

310
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,119
-I thought you were tough, Tarzan.
-Stupid.

311
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,599
-Tired already?
-Stupid!

312
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,519
-Hi, Martin.
-I've been trying to call you.

313
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,279
Fancy a beer tonight? Some wine?

314
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,159
No, I'm in Sweden with Felix.
I've found myself a boyfriend.

315
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,079
You've...got a boyfriend?

316
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,799
I'll explain some other time.

317
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,079
-Okay, but when are you back?
-Listen, I have to go. Bye.

318
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,879
He can't just lie there.

319
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,879
Are you all right?

320
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,999
-Let's go, then.
-Yes, back to the apartment.

321
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,519
-Are we going home?
-It's raining.

322
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,759
-I want to go home.
-We're going home now.

323
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,919
I'm going to check my mail.

324
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,319
-Did you write any more scenes?
-No.

325
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,439
Something to drink, Felix?

326
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,399
Want to do some boxing?

327
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,519
-Now?
-Yes.

328
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,319
Sure. I've never done it before.

329
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,279
-I'll probably be really clumsy.
-I'll teach you.

330
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,319
Are you patient?

331
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,559
But we'll take Felix along.
It'll be fun for him.

332
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,919
Yeah.

333
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,039
Maybe it's a good idea
for him to stay home a bit.

334
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,839
He can play Nintendo or something.
Have some peace and quiet.

335
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,639
Is it all right if Mummy goes out
for some boxing with Jesper?

336
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,319
You would just be bored.
This is important.

337
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,959
-I'll enter my number.
-Yes.

338
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,799
If anything happens
and you get scared, you press OK.

339
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,439
-Okay.
-There, in the middle.

340
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,399
-One second. All right?
-Yes.

341
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,319
Okay. Thanks, sweetie.
Talk later. Bye.

342
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,079
Left, right, left hook.

343
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,559
I'm getting scared! You're good.

344
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,679
That's enough. Don't get too good!
And a right hook, okay?

345
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,119
Once more.

346
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,679
Go!

347
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,359
Like that. And duck!

348
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,519
Have you suddenly become a coach?

349
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,159
Hi.

350
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,759
-How are you?
-I'm good. You?

351
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,959
-Mina, from Norway.
-Nice to meet you.

352
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,839
Some sparring?

353
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,039
-We'll continue later.
-Keep Felix in mind.

354
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,719
-Won't be long.
-Okay.

355
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,159
Loosen up.
Not just single punches.

356
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,639
Punch! Keep moving.
Circle around him, Johan.

357
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,639
Hi!

358
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,999
-How are things going?
-Fine.

359
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,119
-You?
-Fine. May I speak to Felix?

360
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,679
-He's not here right now. He's at home.
-Home? Is he alone?

361
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:50,359
We're just out doing a little boxing.
We'll be home in a minute.

362
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,759
-Is he home alone?
-No! Hello.

363
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,959
-He's not home alone, he's with....
-With whom?

364
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,519
Actually, some friends of my boyfriend.

365
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,679
-They're looking after him.
-He's with strangers?

366
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:11,399
-No. Felix knows them really well.
-But they don't know him.

367
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,359
-I don't like this.
-I have to run. I'll call you later.

368
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,119
Felix!

369
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,679
Felix, I'm coming!

370
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,359
Forgive me.
Are you all right?

371
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,479
Sweetie...

372
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,799
You were supposed to call Mummy
if something was wrong.

373
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,159
-Everything okay?
-I have to calm him down.

374
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,359
-I'll do some writing.
-Listen...

375
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,439
-Was it that bad?
-I want to go home.

376
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,639
Felix.

377
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,519
There, now. Daddy called
and asked how you were doing.

378
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,159
Maybe you could call him tomorrow?
Then you can have a chat with him.

379
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,359
Felix.

380
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,559
Need some help?

381
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,479
Felix, eat now,
so you grow big and strong.

382
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,519
Have some meatballs.

383
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,319
Hey you.

384
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,599
Try to sleep
the whole night through, okay?

385
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,519
If a bad man comes...
Who should die? Jesper or me?

386
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,559
-That will never happen, Felix.
-Yes, it will!

387
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,519
You don't love me.

388
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,559
-Will you sleep the whole night through?
-No.

389
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,999
-You don't love me.
-Yes, I do.

390
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:56,759
You don't love me.

391
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,279
Can we talk?

392
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,319
Yes, sure.

393
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,079
Of course.

394
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,079
What is it?

395
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,119
I can't deal with this situation.

396
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,279
It's like...

397
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,439
I feel really bad about this, but...

398
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,759
I can't deal with Felix being here.
I can't handle it.

399
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:51,279
It's... It's too much.
I'm totally starved of adult company.

400
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,079
I understand,
but what am I supposed to do?

401
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,119
I want to be with you.

402
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,679
Can't we work this out? We'll go back
to Oslo, and you can visit us.

403
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,119
Get to know us better,
I realize this is all new.

404
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,839
-And he can be a bit much.
-I can't think clearly. You understand?

405
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,039
It's all chaotic. I've got a screenplay
to finish. I'm not in balance.

406
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,879
I can't think.

407
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,159
I need time to myself.
Some space.

408
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,599
Just a few days, okay?

409
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,879
I need a few days to sort things out.
Think it through. Get things in order.

410
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,599
-I can't be a family father right now.
-I understand.

411
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,599
-This is not me.
-I understand.

412
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,359
This is not me.

413
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,399
But tomorrow we can have a nice
breakfast. You, me, and Felix.

414
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,239
Then you may borrow my car.

415
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,559
-Would that be okay?
-Yes.

416
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,599
I think I'll leave now.
I think it's best.

417
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,919
Now?

418
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,199
-Please.
-Felix.

419
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,399
It's like I throw you out in the
middle of the night, with a small child.

420
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,799
Please, Mina. I didn't mean
things to turn out like this.

421
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,879
I understand.

422
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,999
This is all wrong.
Do you realize how this feels for me?

423
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,119
I understand.
But I have to leave.

424
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,759
I'll call you.

425
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,799
Felix.

426
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,919
Felix?

427
00:46:46,600 --> 00:47:13,199
Felix!

428
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,959
Felix, where are you?

429
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,479
Answer me! Felix!

430
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,559
This isn't funny anymore!
Answer me!

431
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,639
Felix!

432
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,079
-What are you up to?!
-Easy!

433
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,679
Damn bitch.

434
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,039
What the hell are you doing?

435
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,919
Why did you run off?
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

436
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,519
You're not allowed to
run off from Mummy!

437
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,599
Do you understand what I'm saying?

438
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,399
Look at me! You're not allowed
to run off from Mummy!

439
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,919
Don't you understand?

440
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,039
Damn brat!

441
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,479
Promise me you won't run off
from Mummy. Okay?

442
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,119
-Can you say it?
-I'm not allowed to run off from Mummy.

443
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,599
Hello there, my boy!

444
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,519
Come here!

445
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,159
How are you doing?

446
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,199
-I've missed you!
-Can I have a goodbye hug?

447
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,919
-Give Mummy a goodbye hug.
-Come here.

448
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,039
See you next week.
I'll call you tomorrow.

449
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,759
-Tell me what you've been up to!
-We played games...

450
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,439
Hi, this is Jesper.

451
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,039
I can't come to the phone right now,
but leave a message...

452
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,959
Hi, this is Jesper.

453
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,719
Hi, it's Mina.
We've arrived safely.

454
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,919
I hope you've had some time and space.

455
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,479
Please give me a call
when you get this message.

456
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,959
Hi, this is Jesper.

457
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,159
I've been in Sweden.
Visiting my boyfriend.

458
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:31,119
My contacts there asked me
if I wanted to audition for a film.

459
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,199
-What kind of role?
-The lead.

460
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,199
And I'm in the last three,
so that's exciting.

461
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,559
-Do you have an agent there?
-Not yet.

462
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,319
-I've been in touch with some people.
-Exciting.

463
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,959
We've got more than enough.
Thanks for coming in.

464
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,239
-You're sure?
-Yes.

465
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,479
-Thank you
-You're welcome.

466
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,599
-Will you open the door?
-Mummy?

467
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,639
-The door is not opening!
-I'll come downstairs and open up.

468
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,479
What's happened?

469
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,799
Your father has wrecked my life.

470
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,079
This is for you.

471
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,959
You know...

472
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:09,279
Yesterday I invited Mrs. Chamim and
Mrs. Vakaar for supper at our home.

473
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,519
I made kofte and kebab.

474
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,239
Roti, raita, salad...
All with my own hands.

475
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,079
But did they touch the food?

476
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,439
No.
They just complained about you.

477
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,239
Mrs. Vakaar has seen you out
wearing practically nothing...

478
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,599
...and kissing a stranger.

479
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,039
Then your father started yelling at me,
as though it was my fault.

480
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:51,279
How can it be my fault? I never told you
to run away from home...

481
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,319
...and start doing things
that bring shame upon us!

482
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,519
Do you know
how much he beat me last night?

483
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,999
Then he walked out of the house
and didn't come home.

484
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,159
Tell me, who will listen to my pain?

485
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,919
I'm talking to you.
Are you listening?

486
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,359
I'm listening.

487
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,559
It's not my fault.

488
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:32,159
For a long time now I have been
punished for something I haven't done.

489
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:39,879
Am I not a human being?
My heart longs for peace and affection.

490
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,759
What I...

491
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,919
What I wanted to say was...

492
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,919
Can't you come over
and visit us from time to time?

493
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,919
Okay.

494
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,399
-Hi.
-Hi, beautiful.

495
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,879
Sorry to wake you,
but I'm really desperate.

496
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,079
There's a party going on.
I wanted to get away from it all.

497
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,519
Are you all right?

498
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,999
My photographer
is so attention seeking.

499
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,679
You'd think
he was doing it all himself.

500
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,239
-But, my love...
-He doesn't respect our collaboration!

501
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,959
Don't cry.

502
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,879
Hey...

503
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,319
I told my shrink. I don't know
how we can work together.

504
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,199
Stand up for yourself.

505
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,279
You should be here. Then
I could kiss your beautiful hands.

506
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,039
Can't you come to Oslo?

507
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,759
What do you think?

508
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,279
You're so sexy
when you're concentrated.

509
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,359
You're gorgeous.

510
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,039
I've got some more muscle tone.
Want to see?

511
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,879
-Do you see?
-Well done.

512
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,439
You're looking good.

513
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,039
God, you're sexy.
Can't you take off some clothes?

514
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,559
-No...
-Yes. Please undress.

515
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,479
Okay...

516
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,599
Oh, you're so sexy.

517
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,239
Show me your tits.

518
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,679
I want to see both of them.

519
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,159
-So this is where you are.
-Hi.

520
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,439
Say hello to my Indian princess
from Norway.

521
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,559
I've heard many
great things about you.

522
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,279
My best friend and director
of photography, Simon. Mina...

523
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,879
-Isn't she beautiful?
-very pretty.

524
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,239
Bye, Mina. Talk soon!

525
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,439
-Get back to the party. We miss you.
-Yes, I'm coming.

526
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,919
-Come on, Jeppe!
-I'll be right there.

527
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,399
Sorry, Mina.
I don't think he caught on.

528
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,839
I hope not.

529
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,479
-Sleep well, darling.
-You too.

530
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,159
Mina!

531
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,239
Felix, Mummy's there.

532
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,319
-Mummy is coming.
-I don't want to go.

533
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,559
Let's just finish the game.

534
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,199
-Hi, Mina!
-Hi. How are things?

535
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,199
-Nice to see you.
-Everything all right?

536
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,879
-And you've got a dog!
-Yeah, a real fatty.

537
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,319
-Want to say hello?
-I'm a bit scared of dogs.

538
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,959
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-I just had some coffee.

539
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,199
Felix! Want to see
what Mummy has bought?

540
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,919
Want to see?
Come. Give me a hug.

541
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,039
It's great to see you.

542
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,959
Water...

543
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,919
Then a little magic...

544
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,639
-I want that one.
-That one. Okay.

545
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,199
You think you'd like a real tattoo
when you grow up?

546
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,679
Of a dragon?

547
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,599
Okay.

548
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,679
Let's see...

549
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,599
It's cold!

550
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,559
Put your hand on top.
Like this.

551
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,639
And count to ten.

552
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,479
Have you had a good day?

553
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,039
My whole body
is crying out for you!

554
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,399
I'm the only one who can hear it
screaming. I'm coming soon.

555
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,919
-You're coming here?
-Tomorrow.

556
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:29,039
Fantastic!
I can show you all of Oslo.

557
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,839
We can go to the flicks,
drink champagne...

558
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,759
Stay in bed all day, if you prefer.

559
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,599
-I would die without you.
-No.

560
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,759
It's true.
I'd die without you!

561
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,239
Listen.
You're fantastic.

562
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,959
-You are fantastic!
-No, you are fantastic.

563
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,879
-You are fantastic.
-Bye.

564
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,519
We'll go to Daddy in a minute.

565
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,679
Then you can be with Daddy
for a few days.

566
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,559
Is that okay? Felix?

567
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,519
Is that okay?

568
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,839
Like you spend time
with your friends,...

569
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,199
...Mummy needs to spend some time
with Jesper, who is my friend. Okay?

570
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,959
I'm sure Daddy misses you.

571
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,879
Don't look at me like that. I love you.

572
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,999
And they've got that cute new dog.
You'll all have lots of fun.

573
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,879
Let's go!

574
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,879
Daddy will be really surprised.

575
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,759
Hi.

576
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,759
Sorry.

577
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,439
We'll have to go back
to the original plan.

578
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,879
-Let go of me.
-No, you have to wait here.

579
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,239
I can...

580
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,799
I have to deal with something.
I'll be back with the drawing shortly.

581
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,719
Hello, my boy.

582
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,159
Just wait here while I talk Mummy.

583
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,319
I'll be back in two seconds. Sit here.

584
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,839
Sorry to show up out of the blue.
There's a bit of a crisis today.

585
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,959
-I can't have him now. I'm at work!
-I realize that, but...

586
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,319
We must stick to our agreements.

587
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,519
-I can't step in...
-I don't mean to mess things up.

588
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,279
Mummy is ill,
and I have to prepare for my part.

589
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,719
He's better off with you
when I'm this busy.

590
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,839
Bad timing. I can't do this.

591
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,999
Can't you help me,
and have him for a few days?

592
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,119
Don't ask me to do this again.
Not ever.

593
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,239
This is the last time! I promise.

594
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,639
From now we stick to our agreements.
Don't ask me again!

595
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,439
Hi, this is Jesper.

596
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,119
-I don't know what to say.
-If there's that much stress,...

597
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,719
...I can come to you.
It's only an hour on the plane.

598
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,559
-I don't know what to say...
-Wouldn't it be nice?

599
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,199
-Mina, don't push me.
-I think it would.

600
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,679
-Don't pressure me!
-I'm not, Jesper.

601
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,959
But that's the way it feels! Inside.

602
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:29,999
My whole life has been ruled by women.
Mum, then Frida, and now you. Stop it!

603
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,159
I need to be by myself
for a while, Mina.

604
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,199
We can be friends, right?

605
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,559
Best friends.

606
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,519
Mina. Okay?

607
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:51,399
-Hey... Can't we be friends?
-Jesper...

608
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:55,959
-I don't want to complicate things.
-I understand.

609
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,959
-I just want to be close to you.
-Mina, I don't want to!

610
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,319
It's really hard, but...

611
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,239
That's just the way it is.

612
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,799
That's just the way it is.
Do you understand?

613
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,519
Hi!

614
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,479
-Great view.
-Nice to see you again.

615
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:45,319
-You want coffee or tea, or something?
-Not really.

616
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:50,279
-Do you have anything stronger?
-No. I'm afraid not.

617
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,199
Never mind.

618
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,959
-You don't want anything?
-No.

619
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,639
-Did things go well in Stockholm?
-Yes, everything's fine.

620
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:04,519
-Well...
-Nice of you to come around.

621
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,679
Yes.

622
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,799
Sorry, I just...

623
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,799
It's all right.

624
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,039
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

625
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,839
-And you?
-Yes. Fine.

626
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,879
How are you, father?

627
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,519
I brought some sweets.

628
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,559
You like these.

629
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,719
And this one.

630
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,879
Have you started
working as a prostitute?

631
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,359
No.

632
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,159
It is all very disappointing.

633
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,119
Don't you think I know
what you were up to in Stockholm?

634
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,279
The whole community
has shut us out.

635
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,839
-But...
-Enough, I tell you!

636
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,799
In all of our circle of acquaintances...

637
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,799
...you have spread
filth and shame over us.

638
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,519
Thanks to you, we are outcasts!

639
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,319
We no longer want you in our home.

640
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:53,119
From now on,
all our ties are severed!

641
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,759
Do not come to this house again.

642
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,199
Never come back.

643
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,599
Gin and lime,
and the one behind that white one there.

644
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,519
That's it. That one!

645
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,719
What are you drinking?

646
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,999
Beer.

647
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:15,239
-Are you here by yourself, or what?
-Yes.

648
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,719
-You're not very talkative.
-No, I...

649
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,879
I'm a better listener than a talker.

650
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,759
Shy?

651
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,319
-I'm not.
-No...

652
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,759
I believe you.

653
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,359
Want to dance?

654
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,679
-Sorry. I don't dance that well.
-What?

655
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,839
-I'm not a good dancer.
-Of course you are. Come on!

656
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,759
You're a whole lot better.
I'll just watch.

657
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,599
-Food.
-Bun.

658
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,359
-Grandma.
-Cabin.

659
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,599
-Ski.
-Snow.

660
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,959
White.

661
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,159
-Clean!
-Pine oil soap.

662
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,639
Pine oil soap?

663
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,599
Summer.

664
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,359
Sun.

665
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,039
May.

666
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,959
-May I sit on the back?
-Sure. Just a moment.

667
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,639
-Is that okay?
-Yes.

668
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,759
Stop!
I have to get off.

669
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,759
-I have to get off. Just stop.
-Okay.

670
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,159
-Are you going home now?
-Yes.

671
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,399
I have to get home.
But let me have your number.

672
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,279
-I can give you a ride home.
-That's all right. I just have to go.

673
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,839
Let me have your number first.

674
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,919
41...

675
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,639
46...

676
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,119
96 33.

677
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,919
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

678
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,599
-I just have to get home.
-I see.

679
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,879
Thanks.

680
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,839
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

681
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,319
-Sure?
-Yes, I'm sure!

682
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,319
-Sleep well!
-You too.

683
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:22,319
Bye for now, my little boy.
Have a nice time with Mummy.

684
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,039
I want to show you something.
Come here.

685
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,919
-What do you have in mind?
-Come!

686
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,599
My helicopter.

687
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,959
-Come!
-Go ahead.

688
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,719
-Does he go in there?
-No. Not in there.

689
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,719
He'll sit here.

690
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,239
And this one.

691
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,759
Look at this helicopter.

692
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,159
I'll put the teddy in the bag, too.

693
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,559
Hey...

694
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:56,359
Daddy will be here soon.
In only 5 minutes or so.

695
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:01,959
He's at work, that's all.
And he works a lot, you know.

696
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:08,519
So does Kiran.
And Kiran really loves you.

697
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:15,559
I think she's really nice.
Do you love her?

698
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:22,039
And you miss Daddy too, don't you?
It'll be great to see him.

699
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,279
Felix.

700
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:31,119
You know that I love you dearly.
You know that?

701
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,919
Just sit here.

702
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,079
Mummy has to go now.

703
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,959
It's important.

704
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,879
Hi, it's Mina.

705
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,879
Did I wake you?

706
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,879
May I come for a visit?

707
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,719
Okay, see you soon.

708
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,799
It's my grandmother's place.

709
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,519
-Would you like a cup of tea?
-Yes. Please.

710
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,799
-I've only got green tea.
-Perfect!
