26
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:48,048
Wireless crackling with instructions.

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,462
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

28
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:02,165
Yes, Sir.
Okay. Out.

29
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:04,062
It's always crowded here.

30
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:06,371
Its okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

31
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:08,372
Look at that... you scum!

32
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,282
You get awesome chicken on the left here.

33
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,652
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

34
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:33,740
Morey, stop here.
Ma'am...

35
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:40,181
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

36
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:42,725
Yes, Sir.

37
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,620
Yes, Sir.
Jai Hind, Sir.

38
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:52,538
Boss is in a bad mood today.

39
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:54,406
He's pissed with everyone.

40
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:56,370
His wife must've screamt at him

41
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,337
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

42
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,179
he forgot to take his wife shopping for their anniversary.

43
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,044
She got so upset she cancelled their dinner reservations.

44
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,391
We can handle the toughest of criminals easily...

45
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:12,496
...but when it comes to handling family, we goof up.

46
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:13,660
So true, Ma'am.

47
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:16,237
That's why Morey is taking the day off tomorrow.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,037
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's wedding on Sunday, right?

49
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:19,698
Yes, Ma'am.

50
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:21,568
How is your younger one studying?

51
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,212
Wonder when she studies!

52
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,710
She's always glued to the TV or the computer.

53
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:27,847
That reminds me...

54
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,852
Hello.

55
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,120
- Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

56
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:37,354
- Done with your revision?
- Of course.

57
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,530
I can hear the TV.

58
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,370
- When are you coming?
- Soon.

59
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,233
- Have you got it?
- What?

60
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:42,862
Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:45,068
I was speaking to Jafar.

62
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:45,936
Okay

63
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,636
Better get done with your revision till I am back.

64
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:49,144
O Kay; bye'

65
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,111
Have you fed them?

66
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:54,149
They are getting a royal treatment.

67
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,718
Morey, is feeding them cheese since the afternoon.

68
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:59,152
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

69
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,329
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

70
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,030
These guys love cheese.

71
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:05,461
Our surveillance team is already there, right?

72
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,037
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

73
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:09,299
Shinde...

74
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,570
The baby's crying...

75
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:50,042
oh my God!

76
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:53,813
You son of a...

77
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:54,941
Get up!

78
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,142
Bloody rascal!

79
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,420
Only a mouse can get another mouse out of his hole.

80
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,429
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

81
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:07,397
We are not going to shoot you.

82
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,331
Please, Ma'am...

83
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,207
I don't have orders to shoot you, you scum.

84
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,371
I have to take you in alive.

85
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,707
- Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

86
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:19,076
- Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

87
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,590
God knows who else is hiding inside for a threesome.

88
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:25,452
Get him!

89
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,629
You son of a...

90
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,935
You have dodged us four times before.

91
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,541
You think we'll let you escape so easily?

92
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,359
Ma'am, I am warning you.

93
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:41,696
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

94
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:43,673
Take him away!

95
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,624
Giving refuge to rats spreads plague.

96
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,447
Rehman, you should be thankful to me.

97
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,279
You could at least make love one last time.

98
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,756
Jafar was all set to spoil it for you.

99
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,423
You are ragging me, aren't you, Ma'am?

100
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:19,724
Sir's call.

101
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,293
- Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

102
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,835
Yes, we are taking him to the station.

103
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:25,163
I had ordered you to get him out and nab him...

104
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,900
...not barge right inside the chawl.

105
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:29,409
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

106
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,575
If we had let him come out he would definitely have escaped.

107
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,548
We would have arrested him again if he escaped.

108
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,314
But who would be responsible...

109
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,788
...if a civilian was killed in a shootout?

110
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:39,417
We had taken precautions, Sir.

111
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,295
Taking rats along was your precaution?

112
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,692
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

113
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:45,800
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

114
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,359
Your job is to take orders, not risks.

115
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:50,662
You understand?

116
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,276
Someone please take Sir's wife for shopping.

117
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,925
Go home, Ma'am.

118
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,636
Meera has asked you to come early, right?

119
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:16,834
If we don't get this rascal's paperwork right...

120
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,043
...he'll find a loophole to escape from the law.

121
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,304
No chance, Ma'am.

122
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:22,105
We'll keep the papers ready by morning.

123
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:23,149
You have a look at it.

124
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:24,912
Okay

125
00:07:58,955 --> 00:08:00,162
Sorry, I am late again.

126
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,132
It's okay.

127
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:02,422
Meera, wake up.

128
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,655
Your Aunty is home.

129
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:04,465
sorry...

130
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:05,973
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

131
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:07,557
Aunty! You are so late.

132
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,931
Happy birthday, Aunty!

133
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:10,474
For me?

134
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,384
No, Aunty.
I stood first in the orange belt category.

135
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:17,591
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

136
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,415
Yes.

137
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:26,570
Happy birthday to you...

138
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,670
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

139
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:37,348
Happy birthday m you.

140
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:46,194
This is for Meera.

141
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,168
And for me?
Come on...

142
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,697
Fast, fast, fast.

143
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,634
And this is for you.

144
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:20,632
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

145
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,780
Just like John Abraham
(Indian film star).

146
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,883
Wear these goggles and ride a bike in style...

147
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,519
Hey, hey!

148
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,849
If I look like John Abraham, then girls will chase me.

149
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,283
Show me something else.

150
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,588
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

151
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:37,223
I have a lot of variety.

152
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,365
Try this one.

153
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:40,864
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

154
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:44,239
He was a cop just like you.

155
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:46,706
Roam around in style with these.

156
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,738
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.

157
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,575
We don't need another.

158
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:57,192
Ma'am, I also have a Sunny Leone style goggle.

159
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,527
But that one doesn't have a glass.

160
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:00,564
It's a see through.

161
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,284
That's why I am not offering it.

162
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,359
But don't worry Ma'am.

163
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,836
I know exactly what you are looking for.

164
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:08,013
Hang on a second.

165
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,660
I have a lot of variety...

166
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:15,212
What the hell is going on there?

167
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:16,212
Go check Morey.

168
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,097
Ignore it, Ma'am.

169
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:18,380
We are from the crime branch.

170
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,013
Why do we need to get into it?

171
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,389
Morey, we are from the crime branch later.

172
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,153
We are cops first.
Let's go.

173
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:27,256
Let's go.

174
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:29,961
Ma'am, goggles...

175
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,382
How dare they celebrate Valentine's Day!

176
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:51,689
Enough!
 Enough of this destruction!

177
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:54,879
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.

178
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,359
Let us do our job.

179
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:57,707
Get lost!

180
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,377
Only one of us can do our job right now.

181
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,684
And right now, I am on duty.

182
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,347
So, you stop working and let me work.

183
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,329
Don't act smart.

184
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:09,677
Shut up and get lost.

185
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:10,882
You guys keep going!

186
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:13,257
Last warning.

187
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:14,962
You and your bloody last warning!

188
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:17,790
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

189
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,961
Stan counting, Morey.

00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,237

00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:23,064
Section 147 - rioting.

192
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:25,302

193
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,775

00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,043
...to provoke breach of peace.

00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,753
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

196
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:33,451
Get up!

197
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,720
Two more sections left. Get up!

198
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,800
Section 188 - disobedience to order given by public servant.

199
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:44,900
And Section 353 - assault or criminal force...

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,567
...to deter public servant from discharge of duty.

201
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:53,144
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

202
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:57,354
Jafar, did you get record the video?

203
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:58,420
Yes, Ma'am.

204
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,228
Make sure your boss gets my name right.

205
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,702
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

206
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:09,934
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

207
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,663
Unit 3.

208
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,734
Do whatever the hell you want!

209
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,601
Get lost!

210
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:26,884
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

211
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,197
- How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

212
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:30,299
No, no. Give it for thirty.

213
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:31,727
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

214
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,064
Okay, let's settle at thirty-five. Okay?

215
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:34,400
Okay

216
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:35,831
Pyaari!

217
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,005
Pyaari!
Come here!

218
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:39,271
Hang on.
Aunty, please hurry.

219
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,275
Here's a twenty... thirty...

220
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,276
Pyaari, come quickly!

221
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,285
Coming!

222
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:46,714
Keep the change.

223
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:50,558
Pyaari, get in.

224
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,654
How are you?

225
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,765
There it is.

226
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:03,908
Read later, Pyaari.
Eat first.

227
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,608
I am going to treat both of you this Friday.

228
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:09,243
Really? Why?

229
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:10,315
It's my birthday.

230
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,084
- Really?
- No.

231
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,620
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

232
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:15,783
The whole of India will celebrate it then.

233
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:17,061
Very smart.

234
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:18,897
If the whole of India will celebrate...

235
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:20,832
...then even we must too, right?

236
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:22,518
Right. I'll get the cake.

237
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:23,957
Which flavour do you like?

238
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:24,996
Kaalakhatta.

239
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,270
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

240
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:30,475
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

241
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,050
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.

242
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:33,299
How old will you be?

243
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,747
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

244
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:35,653
Me too.

245
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,285
You too? Same pinch.

246
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,626
What a stroke of luck it was that I found you!

247
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,658
Remember how you were standing at the railway station?

248
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,774
If it wouldn't have been for me, your uncle would have sold you off.

249
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,841
Aunty, but you met me, right?

250
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,337
My Ganpati selected you for me.

251
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:55,573
And me?

252
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:57,307
You, I have selected myself!

253
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:04,252
Shivani, please put these eye drops for me.

254
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,459
Just a second. I am on my last set.

255
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,792
Again?

256
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:15,618
Hurry up please.

257
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:16,831
I have to go to the clinic.

258
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:20,706
What happened?

259
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:24,275
Your Kaku never lets me work out in peace.

260
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:26,279
Really.

261
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:33,295
Why are there so many boxes of cake in the fridge?

262
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:34,726
There will be one more today.

263
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:35,424
Why?

264
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:37,427
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

265
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:40,108
Its been three days, I just can't find her.

266
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,175
So a new cake every day?

267
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,481
We can't feed her a stale cake on her birthday, can we?

268
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:47,881
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears and get her home today.

269
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:48,677
Very good.

270
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:57,323
Yes, Jafar.

271
00:14:58,822 --> 00:14:59,824
I'll handle that.

272
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:02,629
You keep the charge sheet ready.

273
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:03,803
I'll come in some time.

274
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,108
Yes, Jafar.

275
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,971
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

276
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,839
Who are you?

277
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:11,910
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

278
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,478
Who is Shivani Aunty?

279
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:18,757
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

280
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,448
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

281
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,466
Did you find her?

282
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,772
- Who?
- Her.

283
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,365
Who's her?

284
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:30,883
You just asked for her.

285
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,260
Pyaari. Did you find her?

286
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,877
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

287
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,650
I thought since you are a cop you might have found Pyaari.

288
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:44,620
Who let these kids inside?

289
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,162
What's wrong with her?

290
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,368
She's missing since the last four days.

291
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,800
Usually we wait for two days before we file a missing complaint.

292
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,367
These kids wander off sometimes.

293
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:57,779
But they come back in a couple of days.

294
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,481
Pyaari didn't come back till last evening...

295
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:01,340
...so we filed a missing complaint.

296
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,277
Where?
At the D. N. Nagar Police Station?

297
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:04,547
This is D. N. Nagar...

298
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,847
...so we'll obviously go to D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

299
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,283
When did you see her last?

300
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,324
Four days back.

301
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:10,987
I want to meet these kids.

302
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,595
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

303
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:15,564
She was with us three days ago. And...

304
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,768
You fool! We even ate wadapaav.

305
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:21,567
Kids get lost but they also come back.

306
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,046
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

307
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,458
We played together at bed time.

308
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,370
Hide and seek.

309
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:29,350
I haven't seen her after that.

310
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:31,792
I saw her when I came in the morning.

311
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,116
Don't know where she disappeared later.

312
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:35,894
She was carrying her bag of books.

313
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:38,829
I even asked her where she was going.

314
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,063
But she didn't say anything.

315
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:41,892
She just left.

316
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,174
Six months ago even Yashoda Didi disappeared in the same way.

317
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:54,353
One cup of tea

318
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,887
Since when do you have your stall here?

319
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,120
What's the matter Ma'am?

320
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:00,952
ls anything wrong?

321
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,365
Just answer my question.

322
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,499
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

323
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,575
You won't have to pay, if you work for me.

324
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:10,341
What's the job?

325
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:14,340
You have to keep an eye on this shelter home.

326
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:16,315
Who comes in, who goes out.

327
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,582
You want me to be an informer, right?

328
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,249
You are very smart, huh?

329
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,793
A girl called Pyaari is missing from here.

330
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:28,797
Give me all the information you can get.

331
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:29,663
Clear?

332
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:30,895
Write my number down.

333
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:32,670
9-8-2...

334
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:35,811
Meera, are you ready?

335
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,615
I have made your favourite breakfast today.

336
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:39,912
Sharda Bai, one more cup of tea please.

337
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,643
Yes, Sir.

338
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,619
Let me comb your hair today.

339
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,355
- Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

340
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,429
You need a good hair-cut.

341
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:55,637
We'll go to a posh salon in Bandra this Sunday...

342
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,305
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

343
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:02,106
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

344
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,313
Pyaari is missing since five days.

345
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:06,609
And we are behaving as if it never happened.

346
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:08,188
She has been kidnapped.

347
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:15,060
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

348
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:22,545
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

349
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,222
There's no network inside.

350
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,852
So he comes out to take his calls.

351
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:28,156
Something about dealings...

352
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,623
He bought a new cell phone a few days ago.

353
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,071
He is obsessed with clicking snaps on his phone.

354
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,361
He has clicked mine too.

355
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:35,633
Where would he be right now?

356
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:38,743
Ogling at girls outside Chaaya restaurant.

357
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:02,669
Kapil!

358
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:05,974
What are you up to?

359
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,213
Nothing much.
I was just heading home.

360
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,350
Heading home? I'll drop you.

361
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,783
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

362
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,425
It's no bother. Come, sit.

363
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:17,429
Come.

364
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:20,795
Come sit.

365
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:32,440
Half our life is spent waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

366
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:40,794
Whose call is it? Answer it.

367
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:43,994
It's from home.
I am going home anyway.

368
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:50,999
Your family is missing you, huh?

369
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:56,978
Well... my wife gets worried if I don't reach home on time.

370
00:20:57,974 --> 00:20:58,782
Anyway...

371
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:00,979
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

372
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,781
Yes, of course.

373
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:05,121
Take a good one.

374
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:08,129
Done? Show me.

375
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:10,725
What a phone you have there!

376
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:11,759
Ma'am, take a look.

377
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,438
Latest mobile.

378
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:14,430
WOW!

379
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:19,878
Jafar, what did you earn in so many years with the police force?

380
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:20,582
Peanuts!

381
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:26,082
We should also quit our jobs and join an NGO.

382
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:29,658
Pick little girls from the shelter home...

383
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:31,391
...sell them and buy expensive cell phones.

384
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,526
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

385
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:41,637
Don't play dumb.
We know.

386
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,277
Jafar, let's start his interrogation here itself.

387
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:54,053
If we wait for the traffic to move Kapil won't get home on time.

388
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:55,223
Good idea, Ma'am.

389
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:58,690
Speak up.
Who do you work for?

390
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:02,802
I don't understand what you are talking about, Sir.

391
00:22:03,796 --> 00:22:05,275
Why are you stretching it?

392
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:06,941
We are in an 'instant' era.

393
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,972
The quicker you answer, the quicker you get home.

394
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:11,718
Come on speak up.

395
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:14,011
On whose instructions did you kidnap Pyaari?

396
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:15,013
Where is she?

397
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,753
Speak up, you scum!

398
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:24,332
He's just pretending.

399
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,006
You are messing with my head now!

400
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,800
Are you done?

401
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,749
- He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

402
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:39,147
There they are!

403
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:41,651
Morey, call the control room and get reinforcement.

404
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:42,657
- Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

405
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:44,227
Morey keep his mobile.

406
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:53,570
Move aside!

407
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:04,081
Move!

408
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,488
The other shooter.

409
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:34,825
Jafar, this matter is getting complicated.

410
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:36,795
Damn!

411
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:40,803
Pyaari, where are you my child!

412
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:50,707
Come here.

413
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,045
Move.

414
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:58,518
Stop fooling around, guys!

415
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:01,292
Come on.

416
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:03,997
- Go there. Who's next?
- She.

417
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,130
What's the matter, baby?

418
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:06,165
Having fun, aren't you?

419
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,105
Will you rip it or should I?

420
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,743
- Come on.
- No, please no!

421
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:12,947
Come here.

422
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:14,012
No!

423
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:18,919
Get her.

424
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:21,490
Come on.
Stand straight, you!

425
00:24:57,865 --> 00:24:59,971
I am telling you for the last time.

426
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:02,482
Don't do this to me.

427
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:04,918
Please!

428
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,051
Easy, Matt u!

429
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:11,758
Take it off!

430
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:24,392
Take a good look.

431
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:25,698
She's a virgin!

432
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:27,073
In spite of you around?

433
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:29,550
Don't you find anyone else to pick on!

434
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,988
Put her in No. 2.

435
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,047
Baby Doll!

436
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:37,053
Come here to Papa. Come.

437
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:39,055
Hey!

438
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:45,674
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

439
00:25:46,564 --> 00:25:47,566
Are you insane?!

440
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:49,402
Who will you kill with that splinter?

441
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,612
Myself. I will slash myself.

442
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:53,711
Don't slash your wrists.

443
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:57,050
It'll hurt more and will take more time.

444
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:00,053
Loretta School, Kolkata, huh?

445
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,419
Her school is very famous.

446
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:06,025
I was in Hindu College.

447
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,436
Dropped out in the second year.

448
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,137
But that I can help you with.

449
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:13,702
No really.

450
00:26:14,802 --> 00:26:18,580
If you really want to die then cut this vein of your neck.

451
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,645
It'll be quick and it'll be painless.

452
00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:25,593
And if you still want to run I really suggest you drop that idea.

453
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:27,522
Because you have seen me.

454
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,788
What's her name?

455
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:31,362
Mrunal.

456
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:36,835
Mrunal, now it leaves us with two options.

457
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,175
You either work for me...

458
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:41,573
Don't come, don't come.

459
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,809
Chill. It's okay.

460
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:46,886
Or I will have to kill you.

461
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,050
What were you about to do?

462
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:52,828
Yeah. I would have also done the same.

463
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:55,223
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

464
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:57,628
It would have taken 5-7 days for you to die.

465
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:00,074
In front of all the girls.

466
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:01,869
ls that what you want?

467
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:05,379
But what to do?

468
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:08,349
A bit of drama is required to control so many of you.

469
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,578
And that leaves us with our last option.

470
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:14,349
If you want to stay alive...

471
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,055
...and lead a good life I can help you with that too.

472
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,368
You are quite hot, you know.

473
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,703
I can get you the best clients.

474
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:28,472
5 star hotels, fine dining, beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

475
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:30,982
Think about it.

476
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:37,220
But the way I look at it, you don't really have a choice. Do you?

477
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,590
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

478
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,394
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

479
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,195
Put her in No. 1

480
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,149
The shooter has been identified.

481
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,465
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

482
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:42,277
- Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

483
00:28:43,503 --> 00:28:44,072
You are quite hot, you know.

484
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,144
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

485
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:49,517
All the notorious ones together?

486
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:53,586
Ma'am most of them are members of the Ali Gang.

487
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:55,757
This one is Balu Kotian...

488
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,526
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

489
00:28:59,091 --> 00:29:00,901
Go back.

490
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:03,005
Just a moment.

491
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:07,106
This...

492
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,217
Who's this?

493
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,211
I have never seen him before.

494
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:17,554
Kapil loved to flaunt his connections.

495
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:20,257
He's surely a member of some gang.

496
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,497
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

497
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:30,407
To pick up a girl so smoothly, and then shoot him...

498
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,244
Only an organized gang can operate with such finesse.

499
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,421
There is one man, who keeps track of such things.

500
00:29:47,623 --> 00:29:49,865
ls this a new style of interrogation?

501
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:52,229
Feed meat and extract information?

502
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:56,274
Tell me, Rehman, is anything free in life?

503
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:58,607
If everything was without a price...

504
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:00,043
...then would you have become a gangster?

505
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,046
You are right.

506
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:11,625
Do you know him?

507
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:14,927
Are you kidding me?

508
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,898
You want me to be an informer at my stature?

509
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:19,941
You idiot!

510
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:22,203
When I had come to arrest you...

511
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:25,641
...you were begging me not to shoot you.

512
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:27,985
And now you talk about stature?

513
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:29,562
Don't waste my time.

514
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:31,351
I have loads of other work.

515
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:33,688
Katyal.

516
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:36,659
He is Sunny Katyal.

517
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,734
He's not from Mumbai.

518
00:30:39,593 --> 00:30:41,005
He started operating here around three years ago.

519
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,110
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

520
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:50,879
But the real dough comes from drugs and trafficking.

521
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:59,123
Whenever a girl between 8 to 18 years disappears...

522
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:01,330
more often than not he is involved.

523
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:05,697
You can call him the wholesaler of trafficking.

524
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,376
No matter where a girl disappears from, she ends up in his net.

525
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,346
Why is he not on our radar yet?

526
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,646
Your radar?
He is not even on our radar yet.

527
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:18,287
It's impossible to crack how he smuggles drugs and girls.

528
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:21,453
How do the other gangs let him operate?

529
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:23,824
He is a very smart man.

530
00:31:24,787 --> 00:31:25,528
Keeps everyone happy.

531
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:27,295
Has no enemies.

532
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:31,099
But I have a strong doubt that he is not the brain behind all this.

533
00:31:31,463 --> 00:31:33,670
There is someone bigger supporting him.

534
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:37,544
You gave me a lot of information in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

535
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:44,053
I did it for the girl.

536
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,381
Not for the food.

537
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,559
Thanks for the meat.

538
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:58,336
Katyal.

539
00:31:59,167 --> 00:31:59,839
Sunny Katyal.

540
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:01,942
I want to know about every message...

541
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,339
...every call that's made from his cell phone.

542
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:06,711
What time he wakes up in the morning to who he bangs in the night!

543
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:08,090
I want to know everything.

544
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:08,814
Got it?

545
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:09,682
Yes, Ma'am.

566
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:35,691
- Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

567
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:37,122
I want it clear.

568
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,239
Hello, Vakil Sir.

569
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,238
It's a mess here.

570
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:18,751
The crime branch people have made my life hell.

571
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:20,678
I think they'll very soon monitor me in the loo!

572
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:24,183
How did they get to know about you?

573
00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:26,020
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

574
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,989
I just know that they are behind my life with a vengeance.

575
00:33:29,222 --> 00:33:30,064
What will you do now?

576
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:31,700
I am thinking of talking to the commissioner.

577
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:32,967
Moron!

578
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:36,574
Why inform the commissioner about things that he doesn't know yet!

579
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,971
Then please tell me what I should do.

580
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,974
Find out the price of the inspector who's leading this operation.

581
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:42,582
Throw some money at him.

582
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:44,544
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

583
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:45,348
It's some woman.

584
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:47,152
She has a track record of not accepting bribes.

585
00:33:48,014 --> 00:33:50,153
Woman? Tell me her name.

586
00:33:51,018 --> 00:33:52,130
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

587
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,490
From the crime branch.

588
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:55,466
Do one thing.

589
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,868
Get me her number.

590
00:33:56,894 --> 00:33:58,388
I'll call her tomorrow.

591
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:02,039
Get me the number!

592
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:04,565
Like it's a piece of cake.

593
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:07,614
Where the hell am I sitting!

594
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,816
Just when some money was on its way...

595
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:13,220
...this moron has made plans to ruin it.

596
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:19,400
I have a feeling this inspector is going to ask for a huge price.

597
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,866
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

598
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:22,898
Yes.

599
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:28,371
The batch of girls this time is superb.

600
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:30,978
Really?

601
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,217
What did he say?

602
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:35,523
He signed a 200,000 deal.

603
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,888
The foreigners loved the service that our girls gave.

604
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:42,096
What is the status of the girls from Bangladesh?

605
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:43,756
It's getting delayed.

606
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,733
The security at the border has become very stringent.

607
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:47,902
It will take a week more.

608
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:52,737
You are very lenient with them, Vakil Sir.

609
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:58,617
They are very prompt at collecting their payments.

610
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:02,184
But when it comes to delivery, a week's delay?

611
00:35:02,682 --> 00:35:03,353
Not done.

612
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,891
What was her name?

613
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:08,393
Shivani Roy.

614
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,698
Wow! She's hot.

615
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,507
Let it be, Vakil sir.

616
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:19,038
You are too old to deal with women like her.

617
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:22,720
I'll talk to her.

618
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:26,921
Tell Katyal to get all information on her.

619
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:28,853
A week has passed and no leads yet.

620
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:31,028
Either he is smart or our information is wrong.

621
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:35,059
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too is getting impatient.

622
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,437
Let's wait for a few more days.

623
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:39,740
I am sure he will commit some mistake.

624
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,817
Come on. I have got dinner.

625
00:35:59,025 --> 00:35:59,799
Hello?

626
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,499
You reached home, Ma'am?

627
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:02,503
Who's this?

628
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:03,504
Doesn't matter.

629
00:36:04,232 --> 00:36:06,212
How come you picked dinner from Aaswaad tonight?

630
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:07,976
Sharda bai didn't come to work today?

631
00:36:08,537 --> 00:36:11,246
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

632
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:12,264
Want to join us for dinner?

633
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,241
I had heard right about you.

634
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:14,221
Aunty, what have you got?

635
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:15,849
Someone else would have been rattled.

636
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:16,867
Set the plates.

637
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,543
I am very hungry. Call Kaku.

638
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,059
Go, quick, quick.

639
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:21,865
Tell me.

640
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:24,464
Why are you watching me?

641
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:28,739
If you keep a watch on my men then I will have to watch you, right?

642
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:32,110
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

643
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:34,750
You sound like his son though.

644
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,179
How does it matter?

645
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:38,581
It's the same family.

646
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,422
The whole family seems twisted.

647
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:44,755
You are calling me from VOIP so I can't trace your call?

648
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:47,231
To deal with a sharp officer like you...

649
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,329
...one needs to be prepared, right?

650
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,471
No point tracing the IP address...

651
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:54,470
You won't find anything.

652
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:56,106
Enough bragging-

653
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:57,852
Get to the point.

654
00:36:57,878 --> 00:36:58,971
My food is getting cold.

655
00:36:59,773 --> 00:37:02,254
Stop watching my people and quote your price.

656
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:04,053
I want my daughter back.

657
00:37:05,714 --> 00:37:06,420
Daughter?

658
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:08,862
You have a daughter?

659
00:37:09,553 --> 00:37:12,592
The girl you picked up from the Andheri shelter home...

660
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:13,859
...is like my daughter.

661
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:18,306
Oh! That's why you are behind my life.

662
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,714
It might have been possible if you had asked earlier.

663
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:25,815
It's difficult now.

664
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:28,318
Fine. Then the surveillance will continue.

665
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,892
You are stretching this a bit too much.

666
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,197
She was like your daughter, but not your real daughter, right?

667
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:39,635
Let's do one thing.

668
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:43,708
There's a 35 story skyscraper coming up in Wadala.

669
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:46,577
The top floor is yours.

670
00:37:48,205 --> 00:37:52,349
No thanks. If the elevator breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

671
00:37:55,082 --> 00:37:55,787
Then tell me what you want.

672
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:57,858
I told you I want Pyaari back.

673
00:37:59,854 --> 00:38:02,028
Shivani ji, you aren't listening to me.

674
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:05,896
That girl has seen too much.

675
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:08,937
I don't take such a risk in my business.

676
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:11,439
It's too late now.

677
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,412
Aunty, hurry UP!

678
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,186
Listen, kid.

679
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:20,817
I'll come hunting to your house to rescue Pyaari.

680
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,755
But rescue I will.

681
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:24,561
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

682
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:26,826
Chill. Don't get worked up.

683
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,269
It doesn't suit you.

684
00:38:28,493 --> 00:38:29,131
Anything else?

685
00:38:31,463 --> 00:38:32,843
Don't do this.

686
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:35,233
Think about it please.

687
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:38,074
You need to think about it Junior.

688
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:40,645
I won't take too long to reach Pyaari...

689
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,792
...but the day I reach her you won't be capable of even thinking.

690
00:38:46,718 --> 00:38:49,325
Okay, Ma'am.
You do your job and I'll do mine.

691
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,864
Let's just both do what's best for business.

692
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:55,066
But I have to admit it was fun talking to you.

693
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,103
Bye Ma'am.

694
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:05,253
Hello. Mattu, put that girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

695
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,424
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

696
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,918
I'll finish dinner and come.

697
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:10,816
Yes, right now.

698
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:13,790
How dare you touch me?

699
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:17,800
You can't harass a responsible and innocent citizen this way.

700
00:39:18,294 --> 00:39:20,265
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.

701
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,494
I do not understand.

702
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,213
I will speak to the Human Rights Organisations...

703
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:26,248
...and feed you to the dogs.

704
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,573
Sure.

705
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,279
<i>- Jaiar’?
- Pam?</i>

706
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:37,797
You feed us to the dogs and we will feed you jalebis.

707
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:39,458
Jalebi?

708
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:45,441
You will eat the jalebis, feel Very sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

709
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:47,640
I don't eat jalebis.

710
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,106
Shut up and eat!
Or I'll...

711
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,819
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

712
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:56,383
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

713
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:57,182
Eat.

714
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:09,967
Gentlemen, please key in your bids on your iPad screens now.

715
00:40:10,697 --> 00:40:17,379
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

716
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:20,845
She looks grown but is just a child.

717
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:27,230
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

718
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:39,608
No!

719
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:47,317
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday with Ganpati.

720
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:48,721
The whole of India will celebrate it then.

721
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:51,626
How are you?

722
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:52,840
How old will you be?

723
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:53,915
How old are you?

724
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,068
- Twelve.
- Me too.

725
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:55,926
You too?

726
00:40:57,895 --> 00:40:59,637
Pyaari, come quickly.

727
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:09,013
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

728
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,280
What will you become
when you grow up?

729
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:11,582
An airplane driver.

730
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,515
What?

731
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:16,498
It's called a pilot, not a driver, you fool!

732
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:17,863
Same thing.

733
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:22,028
I'll fly the plane very high, right in the middle of clouds.

734
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:36,892
Ma'am, have your ginger tea and fix your mood.

735
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:38,251
Thank you, Jafar.

736
00:41:44,357 --> 00:41:46,065
He's a seasoned player.

737
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:48,469
We stuffed him with a kilo ofjalebis...

738
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,400
...didn't give him even a drop of water...

739
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,713
...but he still didn't open his mouth.

740
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:55,423
Ma'am I'll continue for the next four hours.

741
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:56,268
You go on home.

742
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:00,090
Ask Morey and Pawaskar to continue later.

743
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:02,021
Don't let him sleep even for a second.

744
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:03,126
Yes, Ma'am.

745
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:04,518
Thank you.

746
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:14,335
l am coming.
Two minutes.

747
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,340
Aunty, you are so late!

748
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:23,719
Sorry. But I think we'll soon find Pyaari.

749
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,158
Really, Aunty?
You are the best, Aunty.

750
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:27,081
You are the best.

751
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,768
It won't hurt after a couple of times.

752
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:04,940
Here...

753
00:43:06,301 --> 00:43:07,006
...cupcake.

754
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:09,815
For both of you.

755
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,447
Every girl gets it after her first night.

756
00:43:14,346 --> 00:43:15,188
Have it.

757
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:22,061
I too blew my past away after my first night.

758
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:24,429
That's the only way to survive here.

759
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,774
Otherwise your life will be hell.

760
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:32,608
Come on, now blow the candle and move on.

761
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:35,478
Come on.

762
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:45,432
It's a great idea to teach that nosy cop a lesson.

763
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:48,396
But we'll have to pay a fat price for it.

764
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,134
This guy will do our job for free.

765
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:54,409
Here.

766
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:56,676
Call Riyaz.

767
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:59,447
Tell him that this job must be done.

768
00:44:01,677 --> 00:44:03,384
Performance bonus guaranteed.

769
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:11,862
Shivani ji, you will stop nosing around after this.

770
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:16,773
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

771
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:21,908
It's good that way.

772
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:24,978
Fear gets work done faster.

773
00:44:34,988 --> 00:44:37,230
Morey... 21 missed calls!

774
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:48,410
Ma'am, come quickly.

775
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,377
Why?

776
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:50,953
Ma'am, come quickly please.

777
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,427
Get the pervert doctor!

778
00:46:25,437 --> 00:46:27,111
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

779
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:29,251
...a female patient accused a doctor...

780
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:31,016
...of inappropriate behaviour.

781
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:33,251
Runa, that's my Kaku!

782
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,826
What's going on?

783
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:40,693
A few hours after the allegations...

784
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:42,972
...the members of Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

785
00:46:43,328 --> 00:46:48,039
mattacked the dispensary and defamed the doctor.

786
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:51,712
We had no intentions of taking the law in our hands.

787
00:46:52,274 --> 00:46:55,154
But the people are fuming with anger...

788
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:57,291
...because of the growing exploitation of women.

789
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,918
The anger found its vent this way.

790
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:03,062
That doctor must be punished.

791
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:06,502
Please eat.

792
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:48,356
Hello?

793
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:51,688
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

794
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,832
I am genuinely sorry for what's happened.

795
00:47:57,662 --> 00:48:00,473
In fact I even had tears when I heard the news.

796
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:03,508
But I hope this doesn't change things between us.

797
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:07,012
Because I am just starting to like you.

798
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:10,416
There was nothing personal about this, Ma'am.

799
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:13,421
It's just business.

800
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:16,955
Please don't harbour any misunderstanding.

801
00:48:17,622 --> 00:48:18,225
Please.

802
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:23,601
You know what, Junior, I grew up in a village.

803
00:48:24,398 --> 00:48:27,471
There was a dense forest near my house.

804
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:32,649
That's why from early on in life I knew animals very well.

805
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:37,191
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat Sir took me in the crime branch.

806
00:48:37,983 --> 00:48:40,430
To trap a mouse you have to act like one.

807
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,696
To catch a dog you have to think like one.

808
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:45,263
To hunt a tiger you have to become one.

809
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:47,465
You know what you are?

810
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:52,811
You are that poisonous snake near the river...

811
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:59,023
...who can't be seen but bites oblivious kids swimming in the river.

812
00:49:01,948 --> 00:49:04,327
You should have been with the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

813
00:49:04,952 --> 00:49:06,591
What are you doing in the police force?

814
00:49:08,758 --> 00:49:11,330
You are the one who's about to be discovered, kid.

815
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:14,175
I don't know what your name is.

816
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:16,845
I don't know where you are speaking from.

817
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:20,440
Who your boss is or where you have kept Pyaari.

818
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:23,778
But I've figured your type

819
00:49:25,647 --> 00:49:29,357
No matter how far you try to stay away...

820
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:32,065
...your nature will compel you to come closer to me.

821
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:34,001
30 days.

822
00:49:35,193 --> 00:49:36,730
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

823
00:49:37,263 --> 00:49:41,838
And then with a lot of love and patience I'll squish you to pulp.

824
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:44,944
Mark my words.
30 days.

825
00:50:00,595 --> 00:50:03,577
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's a high command meeting next week.

826
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:05,566
You hear everything, Mattu.

827
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:06,602
But you do nothing.

828
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:08,678
Sir, first you don't give me an opportunity to work...

829
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,108
...and then you call me useless.

830
00:50:10,134 --> 00:50:11,075
This is unfair, Sir.

831
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,585
Big announcements are to be made in the party meeting this time.

832
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:17,427
Now you are making me drool.

833
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:19,892
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

834
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:23,295
Really?
 That means it's going to be huge.

835
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:24,435
That's awesome, Sir.

836
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:27,264
The contract for Taneja's personal party must come to us.

837
00:50:27,464 --> 00:50:29,035
Why should I get you the contract?

838
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:31,800
Name the drug and you'll get it, Sir.

839
00:50:31,826 --> 00:50:33,339
Indian, South American.

840
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,219
And as far as girls go, look at the choice, Sir.

841
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:40,453
Film star or porn star.

842
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:43,287
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

843
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:46,757
Why should I get you the contract?

844
00:50:47,223 --> 00:50:50,832
Oh! I have been blabbering like a fool.

845
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:53,641
The list will obviously begin with you, Sir.

846
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:57,509
And shame on me if you have to tell me your list.

847
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:02,419
Hey, Jennifer!
Come here, baby.

848
00:51:02,445 --> 00:51:04,077
Come here.
Take Sir...

849
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:08,357
Oh! Good choice, Sir.

850
00:51:08,383 --> 00:51:10,054
Hey, Julia Roberts!

851
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:11,900
Darling, baby, come here.

852
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:13,965
Don't be shy.
Come here.

853
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:17,702
Good girl.

854
00:51:17,899 --> 00:51:20,779
Keep the tray here and take Sir to the washroom.

855
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:24,584
Call me on Monday.

856
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:26,813
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

857
00:51:30,616 --> 00:51:31,594
Don't forget, Sir!

858
00:51:32,084 --> 00:51:33,223
Come, baby...

859
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,539
Hey, Mattu.

860
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,142
You really do appear out of nowhere!

861
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:47,609
I have been watching you.

862
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:49,343
How long does it take to crack a deal?

863
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:50,885
I am not selling water purifiers.

864
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:52,657
I am trying to crack a deal worth crores.

865
00:51:52,683 --> 00:51:53,313
It takes time.

866
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:55,185
If he doesn't call on Monday...

867
00:51:55,316 --> 00:51:57,456
I swear I'll go to Katra and sell religious CDs.

868
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:58,959
If this deal doesn't come through...

869
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:01,730
I won't even leave you capable of selling porn CDs at Palika.

870
00:52:01,892 --> 00:52:03,337
I am at it.

871
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:05,699
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

872
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:07,571
Okay. You crack this deal.

873
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:09,772
I'll send you to Mumbai to look after our set up there.

874
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:10,912
Mumbai?

875
00:52:11,438 --> 00:52:13,316
But Katyal is looking after Mumbai, right?

876
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:15,944
Left... left... Very good.

877
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:18,152
Good Job.

878
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:20,424
You fool! Be careful.

879
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:22,226
The packet will break.

880
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:23,764
Be careful.

881
00:52:25,724 --> 00:52:28,103
Guggu, will the car be fixed by evening?

882
00:52:28,461 --> 00:52:29,770
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

883
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:34,378
Hello, Vakil Sir.

884
00:52:34,836 --> 00:52:36,839
This time the consignment is superb!

885
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:38,146
Forget the consignment.

886
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:38,873
Listen to me.

887
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:40,740
That cop chick has lost it.

888
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:42,374
She will pick you up again.

889
00:52:42,847 --> 00:52:45,522
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

890
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,953
Should I fix her?

891
00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:49,666
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

892
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:52,969
You want the entire Mumbai Police force to come behind you?

893
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,034
What should I do then?

894
00:52:54,496 --> 00:52:55,840
Go underground for a few days.

895
00:52:56,399 --> 00:52:57,707
One of my men will come in the evening.

896
00:52:57,967 --> 00:52:59,242
Go with him to the safe house.

897
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:01,780
He will make arrangements for you there.

898
00:53:02,073 --> 00:53:03,746
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

899
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:05,319
Don't crib so much!

900
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,587
Pack your bag and be ready in the evening.

901
00:53:07,914 --> 00:53:09,325
Go with my man.

902
00:53:10,785 --> 00:53:11,456
Bye.

903
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:15,064
Pour it in my mouth!

904
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:16,736
Get lost!

905
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,803
I am surrounded by duck heads!

906
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:22,801
What's going on?

907
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,785
Vakil Sir has sent such an atrocious car!

908
00:53:33,082 --> 00:53:33,890
Good bye, Sir!

909
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:40,165
Hello?
Hello?

910
00:53:43,663 --> 00:53:47,578
The network conks off at the slightest disturbance.

911
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:52,709
Nobody cheats the people more than these cell phone companies.

912
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:54,831
Hello?

913
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:58,544
Hello?
Can you hear me, Sir?

914
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,351
Hello?

915
00:54:01,987 --> 00:54:03,797
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

916
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:06,830
Everything is bloody jinxed!

917
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:08,271
Get out of the car.

918
00:54:11,066 --> 00:54:11,635
Get out.

919
00:54:12,602 --> 00:54:13,876
Vakil Sir!

920
00:54:14,237 --> 00:54:15,945
Get out of the car or I'll shoot you.

921
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:18,017
I am getting out!

922
00:54:19,744 --> 00:54:20,815
Listen to me.

923
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:22,849
Why are you doing this?
 For money?

924
00:54:23,315 --> 00:54:24,294
I'll give you double.

925
00:54:24,684 --> 00:54:25,389
Move!

926
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:28,099
Listen to me once.

927
00:54:28,322 --> 00:54:31,031
I'll give you all the money you want right away.

928
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:32,037
Your life will be made.

929
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:33,471
What's happening with me!

930
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,039
Isn't there a chance?

931
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:42,916
Vakil, what a way to repay my loyalty!

932
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:46,218
Let me tell you one thing before I die.

933
00:54:46,648 --> 00:54:49,653
Don't ever be overtly loyal to anybody in life.

934
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,397
It screws you.

935
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,301
Look at me.

936
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:55,565
Fifteen years...

937
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,483
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

938
00:55:13,117 --> 00:55:15,689
...eventually took the contract to kill you.

939
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:18,295
What a business you guys run!

940
00:55:20,092 --> 00:55:21,265
May I ask you something?

941
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:25,539
How did you know about this?

942
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:29,643
I am beginning to know your boss a little bit.

943
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:36,523
He knew that if he didn't pick you up I would have.

944
00:55:37,316 --> 00:55:41,197
You would always remain a risk to him even if he saved you.

945
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:43,029
When you sat in the car,

946
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:45,901
Morey recognized that your driver was Hanif's man.

947
00:55:46,862 --> 00:55:49,173
Hanif has a brick factory here in Kharegaon.

948
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:51,672
It makes it easier to dispose bodies.

949
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:53,378
True.

950
00:55:55,574 --> 00:55:56,575
I won't leave that rascal.

951
00:55:56,942 --> 00:55:58,183
Nor will I.

952
00:55:59,112 --> 00:55:59,724
So tell me.

953
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,140
Where does the kid stay?

954
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:04,695
Kid?
Which kid?

955
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,091
Your boss.

956
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,097
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

957
00:56:08,257 --> 00:56:09,464
What are you saying, Ma'am.

958
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,470
Vakil is at least 50 - 55 years old.

959
00:56:12,097 --> 00:56:13,201
He is not a kid.

960
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:14,535
You scum!

961
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,811
If you waste our time again...

962
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:19,644
...I'll make you a eunuch and sell you off.

963
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,513
I swear by God I am not lying.

964
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:22,911
If I am lying...

965
00:56:23,312 --> 00:56:25,155
...then do whatever you want to do with me.

966
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:28,328
Vakil got me to Mumbai four years ago.

967
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:30,597
I am working with him since then.

968
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:32,358
Keep talking.

969
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:33,829
I know Vakil very well.

970
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:35,202
He stays in Delhi.

971
00:56:35,494 --> 00:56:35,904
Hello?

972
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:38,541
Damn! Katyal escaped.

973
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:39,570
H ow?

974
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:41,571
Hanif's man was found dead.

975
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:43,543
How did he die?

976
00:56:43,873 --> 00:56:44,851
He was shot.

977
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:45,748
Where?

978
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:49,556
Tell me, where was Hanif shot?

979
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:51,622
On the body.

980
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,129
Where on the body?

981
00:56:53,155 --> 00:56:54,789
Front?
Behind? Where?

982
00:56:57,725 --> 00:56:58,897
He was shot in the head from behind.

983
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:00,469
Where did they find the dead body?

984
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:01,868
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

985
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,110
Hang up the other phone.

986
00:57:09,307 --> 00:57:09,978
Hung UP-

987
00:57:10,675 --> 00:57:14,056
Someone saved Katyal exactly where he was supposed to be killed.

988
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:15,589
But who saved him?

989
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:16,859
Who else?

990
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:19,127
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

991
00:57:20,422 --> 00:57:22,596
It's time to send her another gift.

992
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:08,363
Congrats Ma'am.

993
00:58:09,154 --> 00:58:11,658
Someone has dared to point a finger at me for the first time.

994
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:13,897
Every time you point a finger at me...

995
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:16,072
...you will get this gift from me.

996
00:58:16,865 --> 00:58:18,742
Your Kid.

997
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:42,301
Hunt this guy down.

998
00:58:42,327 --> 00:58:44,298
No matter what.

999
00:59:05,797 --> 00:59:06,468
Hello!

1000
00:59:06,899 --> 00:59:08,077
I have left from the hotel.

1001
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:09,235
l am going to office now.

1002
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:13,145
Be calm.
You are the most dangerous when you are calm.

1003
00:59:21,686 --> 00:59:23,222
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

1004
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:24,967
He was my senior in the institute.

1005
00:59:25,224 --> 00:59:26,931
We used to have fun times those days.

1006
00:59:27,627 --> 00:59:29,106
He praises you very highly.

1007
00:59:29,963 --> 00:59:33,538
He is my teacher and guide otherwise I behave like awild bull.

1008
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:34,714
You know what.

1009
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,306
Good officers like you...

1010
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,108
- May I?
-Yes, come in.

1011
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,786
- Sir...
- Take a seat.

1012
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:45,428
Meet Sub-Inspector Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

1013
00:59:45,718 --> 00:59:46,719
A very efficient officer.

1014
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:47,994
Shivani Roy.

1015
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,463
- Ma'am...
- Senior Inspector, Mumbai Crime Branch.

1016
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:53,429
She has come with information on a huge child...

1017
00:59:53,495 --> 00:59:55,737
...and drug trafficking syndicate in Delhi.

1018
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:59,779
You guys have my full support to go the whole yard on this, okay?

1019
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:00,672
Thank you, Sir.

1020
01:00:01,305 --> 01:00:03,252
- Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

1021
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:05,082
Your source?
Here?

1022
01:00:05,378 --> 01:00:08,019
I have got him here with Sinha Sir's help.

1023
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:09,757
- Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

1024
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:12,265
Ditto!
This is exactly how he looks.

1025
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:14,494
The same curls, light eyes.

1026
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,450
He is the one.

1027
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:18,267
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

1028
01:00:18,797 --> 01:00:20,299
But nobody knows his real name.

1029
01:00:20,932 --> 01:00:22,674
He sometimes deals as Devinder Pasricha.

1030
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:24,904
Or opens an office in the name of Aakash Pandey.

1031
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,316
But he keeps no name or office for more than six months.

1032
01:00:28,776 --> 01:00:32,247
We haven't heard of him ever.

1033
01:00:32,682 --> 01:00:34,320
He takes pride in that.

1034
01:00:34,784 --> 01:00:36,492
He always boasts that he will never get arrested.

1035
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:38,458
Isn't there a way of reaching him?

1036
01:00:38,623 --> 01:00:40,034
Of course there is.

1037
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:42,663
One is drugs and the other is girls.

1038
01:00:43,062 --> 01:00:45,168
And that too because he is getting senile with age.

1039
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,977
We can't go posing as customers for girls.

1040
01:00:49,337 --> 01:00:51,579
He will be expecting me to do something like this.

1041
01:00:51,874 --> 01:00:53,877
We'll have to play him in such away...

1042
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:56,558
...that lures him to us instead of us approaching him.

1043
01:00:57,882 --> 01:01:01,627
Usually drug suppliers deal only in one kind of drug...

1044
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:03,994
...but he deals in all kinds of drugs.

1045
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:06,396
If he has his way he'll sell cough syrup as drugs.

1046
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:07,632
He is that greedy.

1047
01:01:08,096 --> 01:01:09,541
As far as I know, Sodhi...

1048
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:12,239
...South American drug is hard to get, right?

1049
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,448
Right. And even if you get it, its very expensive.

1050
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:18,684
That means a higher profit margin.

1051
01:01:20,245 --> 01:01:22,419
He will do anything for business.

1052
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:27,130
If we can get this news to Vakil that we are not buyers...

1053
01:01:27,456 --> 01:01:30,995
...but suppliers of such high-end cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

1054
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:34,033
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

1055
01:01:34,498 --> 01:01:37,537
If he comes to know then it is sure to reach Vakil.

1056
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:42,281
But our drug supplier should look genuine.

1057
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,090
Why should we do it?

1058
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:54,298
Because it's a question of somebody's life Mbangwa.

1059
01:01:54,558 --> 01:01:56,402
But it's a matter of our life too.

1060
01:01:56,695 --> 01:01:57,833
And what if we get killed?

1061
01:01:58,064 --> 01:01:59,338
Who will kill you?

1062
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,409
We are here to protect you. Relax.

1063
01:02:02,236 --> 01:02:03,340
Stupid policeman.

1064
01:02:05,407 --> 01:02:06,010
No.

1065
01:02:07,943 --> 01:02:09,355
Listen to me Mboso.

1066
01:02:10,948 --> 01:02:13,190
Don't forget you don't have any passport.

1067
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:16,197
So either I will make papers to deport you back...

1068
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:18,198
...or I will arrange for your stay in Tihar Jail.

1069
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:20,133
You decide.

1090
01:02:35,081 --> 01:02:36,287
- Where's Bob?
- What?

1091
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:37,599
Where Bob?
Bob?

1092
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,215
Bob?
 Down there.

1093
01:02:39,286 --> 01:02:39,957
Okay

1094
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,761
Hail Almighty!

1095
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,876
Mindblowing stuff!

1096
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,037
Very good, very good.

1097
01:02:51,168 --> 01:02:52,978
' Hey. Bob!
- Baby!

1098
01:02:54,741 --> 01:02:55,981
- Having fun?
- Yeah!

1099
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:57,020
Go enjoy!

1100
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:01,927
So, big guy, how much do you have?

1101
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:03,185
Five.

1102
01:03:03,552 --> 01:03:04,724
Five what?

1103
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,125
Five kilos.

1104
01:03:06,923 --> 01:03:07,958
Are you crazy?

1105
01:03:08,425 --> 01:03:11,840
I want 100 grams only.

1106
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:16,674
Hey listen.
It's either full or nothing.

1107
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:17,744
Let's go.

1108
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:22,686
Listen, come here.

1109
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:25,906
I will tell you one thing.

1110
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:28,180
I have one customer who will take it all.

1111
01:03:28,485 --> 01:03:30,329
The whole material.
Okay?

1112
01:03:30,955 --> 01:03:33,232
How much longer?
 Please hurry.

1113
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:37,605
What should I tell Bob?

1114
01:03:39,033 --> 01:03:39,875
Who's Bob?

1115
01:03:40,703 --> 01:03:42,842
Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

1116
01:03:46,076 --> 01:03:47,248
He met those Nigerians.

1117
01:03:47,845 --> 01:03:49,883
- How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

1118
01:03:51,684 --> 01:03:53,129
Give me some onions.

1119
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,058
The material will be good if Bob has checked it.

1120
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,935
Besides the cricket season is beginning from next month.

1121
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,305
How much longer?

1122
01:04:02,698 --> 01:04:03,939
It's been a long time now.

1123
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:13,223
Tell all our people that if someone demands girls...

1124
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:17,758
...especially young girls, then don't entertain.

1125
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,464
Our cop chick will surely send someone as a customer.

1126
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:23,729
Not to take any new customers?

1127
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:25,905
I said no.

1128
01:04:26,564 --> 01:04:27,446
This is the limit now!

1129
01:04:27,472 --> 01:04:28,193
How much longer?

1130
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:31,045
Taste from my plate if you are in such a rush.

1131
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,379
What else to say!

1132
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:36,931
Call the Nigerian.

1133
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,574
But in our manner.

1134
01:04:42,051 --> 01:04:43,053
Yeah, Bob.

1135
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:46,535
The call has come. I am leaving.

1136
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:48,063
Okay

1137
01:04:52,065 --> 01:04:54,273
Mathur, I'll wait at Babur Road.

1138
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:56,382
Tell me the position of Mboso's car later.

1139
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:57,713

1161

Ma'am, what are you doing?

1162
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,362
We called for it first.

1163
01:05:18,534 --> 01:05:20,242
Shut up!
 Or I'll call the police.

1164

Ma'am we are the police.

1165
01:05:22,405 --> 01:05:23,376
We are going to raid a place.

1166
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:24,104
Want to come along?

1167
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,514
Ma'am, let's go.

1168
01:05:26,078 --> 01:05:26,886
Sit. Quick.

1169
01:05:26,979 --> 01:05:28,091
I am leaving. Have patience.

1170
01:05:28,117 --> 01:05:28,951
Let me take my bag.

1171
01:05:29,082 --> 01:05:31,256
The cops are riding autos these days.

1172
01:05:31,986 --> 01:05:32,623
- Please hurry.
- Auto!

1173
01:05:32,987 --> 01:05:34,144
Tell Sodhi Mboso's location.

1174
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,118
Right away Ma'am.

1175
01:05:51,813 --> 01:05:53,725
We have got a biker who's asking us to follow.

1176
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:54,754
Follow him.

1177
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,401
Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso.
Be alert.

1178
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:47,930
Sod h I, stop.

1179
01:06:48,456 --> 01:06:49,569
Stop following Mboso.

1180
01:06:49,595 --> 01:06:50,655
They are watching.

1181
01:06:57,835 --> 01:06:59,372
Come, Sodhi.
They have left.

1182
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:04,487
- Mathur...
- Yes, Ma'am.

1183
01:07:04,878 --> 01:07:06,789
Track the car on GPS and let me know.

1184
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:08,320
- Okay?
- Right, Ma'am.

1185
01:07:13,356 --> 01:07:13,993
Go.

1186
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:21,709
Yes, Math u r.

1187
01:07:22,602 --> 01:07:23,774
Sodhi, take a left.

1188
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:27,171
Vakil sir, is everything fine?

1189
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:28,168
Should I come up?

1190
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,891
All okay.
 You can come up.

1191
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:33,621
Okay

1192
01:07:38,356 --> 01:07:40,564
Sodhi, Stop.
That's Mboso's car.

1193
01:08:13,404 --> 01:08:14,212
The cops are here.

1194
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:16,752
Get out from the back door.

1195
01:08:18,343 --> 01:08:20,449
Sodhi, there'll be a back door.

1196
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,657
Cover from there.

1197
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:24,419
Bloody swine!
You got the cops!

1198
01:08:24,553 --> 01:08:26,533
Ratan, they'll come up if they hear a gun shot.

1199
01:08:26,755 --> 01:08:28,030
You leave from the back door.

1200
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:00,584
Vakil Sir, leave!

1201
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:01,700
The cops have surrounded us.

1202
01:09:01,936 --> 01:09:03,279
You've deceived Vakil!

1203
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:04,645
Leave, Vakil Sir.

1204
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:06,107
Hurry!
The police is here.

1205
01:09:06,508 --> 01:09:08,955
Leave from the back door. Hurry!

1206
01:09:17,857 --> 01:09:19,030
Ratan, you escape from the roof.

1207
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:19,630
What about you?

1208
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,562
Don't worry about me.

1209
01:09:20,627 --> 01:09:21,231
Okay

1210
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:30,511
Break it.

1211
01:09:35,147 --> 01:09:36,218
Yes, Vakil Sir?
Are you out of there?

1212
01:09:40,621 --> 01:09:41,532
Come, you...

1213
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,037
You conned us!

1214
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,081
In the Nehru Place office...

1215
01:09:55,174 --> 01:09:59,352
...there's a black diary beneath my chair.

1216
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:01,356
It has the numbers and addresses of our clients.

1217
01:10:01,483 --> 01:10:03,588
Keep that carefully.

1218
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:08,429
I don't have time.

1219
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:14,542
If they arrest me they'll reach you.

1220
01:10:15,803 --> 01:10:17,305
And I won't ever let that happen.

1221
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,644
What are you talking about, Vakil Sir?

1222
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:21,245
We'll get you out somehow.

1223
01:10:21,271 --> 01:10:22,510
You just leave now.

1224
01:10:22,712 --> 01:10:26,526
Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye.

1225
01:10:26,884 --> 01:10:28,522
Hello?
Vakil Sir?

1226
01:10:31,657 --> 01:10:32,466
Vakil Sir?

1227
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:53,420
Move, move. Sod h i.

1228
01:11:20,222 --> 01:11:20,826
Damn!

1229
01:11:53,067 --> 01:11:55,241
You piece of trash!

1230
01:12:31,218 --> 01:12:32,857
- Hello?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

1231
01:12:34,089 --> 01:12:34,966
Did you sleep well?

1232
01:12:35,758 --> 01:12:36,914
You are up so early?

1233
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,731
Do you work in a call centre?

1234
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,231
What to do Ma'am!

1235
01:12:40,932 --> 01:12:43,539
I couldn't sleep wondering how to kill you.

1236
01:12:44,036 --> 01:12:46,984
So have you decided how you'll kill me?

1237
01:12:47,674 --> 01:12:49,273
I won't kill you.

1238
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:51,649
You will kill yourself.

1239
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:55,521
I am just going to lie back and watch you.

1240
01:12:56,753 --> 01:12:59,861
Wow! That's some style you got kid!

1241
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:01,997
Are you done wishing good morning...

1242
01:13:02,194 --> 01:13:03,469
...or is there anything else you want to say?

1243
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,202
What is there to say?

1244
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:10,046
Now, I will show you what I can do.

1245
01:13:11,907 --> 01:13:14,252
You are sharp I must admit.

1246
01:13:15,746 --> 01:13:17,226
You killed Vakil Sir...

1247
01:13:18,849 --> 01:13:20,852
...hid your family safely.

1248
01:13:22,354 --> 01:13:24,562
But now you can't harm me anymore.

1249
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:26,935
Because I am still alive.

1250
01:13:27,061 --> 01:13:29,042
And I am comfortably sitting in my own house.

1251
01:13:30,665 --> 01:13:32,543
But you are in my territory.

1252
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:35,615
Beware.

1253
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:50,130
Don't chew.
Swallow!

1254
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,305
Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1255
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:55,202
You just have to eat this pellet.

1256
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,102
Even the grapes are here.

1257
01:13:57,268 --> 01:13:59,077
Will you practice with grapes?

1258
01:13:59,504 --> 01:14:01,348
- I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1259
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:03,214
You better!

1260
01:14:03,243 --> 01:14:04,244
Open your mouth.

1261
01:14:04,344 --> 01:14:05,915
Give me some other work.

1262
01:14:06,414 --> 01:14:07,779
Enough of your nonsense.

1263
01:14:07,805 --> 01:14:09,114
Eat or I'll slap you!

1264
01:14:10,352 --> 01:14:10,990
Mattu is here.

1265
01:14:11,016 --> 01:14:12,517
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1266
01:14:12,722 --> 01:14:13,450
Stop your drama.

1267
01:14:13,476 --> 01:14:15,226
Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1268
01:14:15,259 --> 01:14:17,501
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1269
01:14:17,696 --> 01:14:19,175
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1270
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:20,438
Yes, they are.

1271
01:14:20,533 --> 01:14:21,773
You worry too much.

1272
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:23,275
By the way when are you sending me to Mumbai?

1273
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:24,815
I'll take care of our set up there.

1274
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:27,551
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1275
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,885
6 girls are leaving for London and 3 for Texas.

1276
01:14:30,948 --> 01:14:33,759
Their domestic help visas and documents are ready.

1277
01:14:34,419 --> 01:14:35,955
Last time on the way to the airport...

1278
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,966
...a pellet burst in one girl's stomach.

1279
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:39,065
Remember?

1280
01:14:39,526 --> 01:14:41,005
ls anyone else going to die this time?

1281
01:14:41,094 --> 01:14:43,200
No. This time Alka has taken all precautions.

1282
01:14:43,264 --> 01:14:44,902
- Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1283
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:46,908
This time I have used the safest coatings.

1284
01:14:47,302 --> 01:14:48,646
The pellets won't burst.

1285
01:14:48,838 --> 01:14:50,146
Chill. Everything is under control.

1286
01:14:50,406 --> 01:14:50,976
Yes.

1287
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,523
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.

1288
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:54,772
Get rid of the rest.

1289
01:14:55,113 --> 01:14:56,285
We must have only the best in the party.

1290
01:14:56,415 --> 01:14:57,553
- Alka.
- Yes.

1291
01:14:57,783 --> 01:14:59,422
Have you sent our man to the police headquarters?

1292
01:14:59,586 --> 01:15:02,090
Yes. He's been waiting since the morning.

1293
01:15:02,256 --> 01:15:03,735
She will definitely go there.

1294
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:04,692
You don't worry.

1295
01:15:04,718 --> 01:15:06,127
Dinesh will handle her.

1296
01:15:06,929 --> 01:15:09,376
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1297
01:15:11,902 --> 01:15:13,610
Angelina, baby...

1298
01:15:14,906 --> 01:15:16,250
...what's wrong with you?

1299
01:15:16,776 --> 01:15:17,982
- Nothing...
- Nothing!

1300
01:15:18,211 --> 01:15:20,249
She hasn't slept well last night.

1301
01:15:20,414 --> 01:15:22,793
ls your name Julia or Angelina?

1302
01:15:24,185 --> 01:15:24,926
Julia...

1303
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:27,397
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1304
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:31,029
Look at your condition.

1305
01:15:31,055 --> 01:15:32,599
Why don't you do something about it?

1306
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,742
I am just tired...

1307
01:15:36,236 --> 01:15:37,806
Tired, huh?

1308
01:15:38,338 --> 01:15:41,479
That's why you have this strip of cloth on your forehead.

1309
01:15:42,911 --> 01:15:43,946
I understand.

1310
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:46,590
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1311
01:15:47,283 --> 01:15:49,594
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1312
01:15:49,787 --> 01:15:50,630
No, no, no...

1313
01:15:50,822 --> 01:15:51,519
Let it be, Mattu.

1314
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:53,020
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1315
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:56,506
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1316
01:15:58,164 --> 01:16:01,612
Please let her stay. Please.

1317
01:16:02,905 --> 01:16:04,749
- Come on.
- I am alright.

1318
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:08,056
- Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1319
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:16,826
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1320
01:16:19,427 --> 01:16:20,770
<i>- Hurry.
-Yes.</i>

1321
01:16:24,434 --> 01:16:25,276
Runa...

1322
01:16:27,104 --> 01:16:27,913
Runa...

1323
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:31,479
Get her quickly!

1324
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,925
Runa... No! Runa!

1325
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:36,120
Take her away.
 Come on!

1326
01:16:36,484 --> 01:16:37,292
Runa!

1327
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,496
Please don't take her.
 Please stop!

1328
01:16:50,036 --> 01:16:54,247
Shivani, don't stretch this case too much.

1329
01:16:54,674 --> 01:16:57,178
We have got the man we were looking for.

1330
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:58,620
But we didn't, Sir!

1331
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:01,055
The mastermind of this syndicate is still roaming free!

1332
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:02,884
This is what you think, Shivani.

1333
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,253
We don't know that for sure.

1334
01:17:04,522 --> 01:17:05,933
I know that for sure, Sir.

1335
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:07,586
I have spoken to him myself.

1336
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:09,230
And not just drugs...

1337
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:10,933
...but he also is the kingpin of sex trafficking.

1338
01:17:12,064 --> 01:17:14,841
Shivani, trafficking is altogether a different matter.

1339
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:18,273
We have a trafficking department to investigate that.

1340
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:19,719
Department?

1341
01:17:21,478 --> 01:17:24,949
There's a department to lodge an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1342
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,126
In spite of that why is just one out of every twenty complaint registered?

1343
01:17:29,088 --> 01:17:30,864
Sir, you don't need the law to do something.

1344
01:17:31,024 --> 01:17:32,128
You need intent.

1345
01:17:32,358 --> 01:17:35,363
And you are determined to find that girl all by yourself, right?

1346
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:38,008
She has a name too.
 Pyaari.

1347
01:17:38,968 --> 01:17:44,750
All these girls who need our help just end up being 'that girl'.

1348
01:17:46,144 --> 01:17:47,818
No name, no ties.

1349
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,896
It's very easy to give up on them.

1350
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:53,362
You know what, Shivani.

1351
01:17:53,388 --> 01:17:55,155
You are being unnecessarily emotional.

1352
01:17:55,324 --> 01:17:58,032
So one should get emotional only after girls are raped?

1353
01:17:58,395 --> 01:18:02,276
What's the point of holding a candle march after every-thing's over?

1354
01:18:03,534 --> 01:18:06,243
After all these days, I don't know what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1355
01:18:06,404 --> 01:18:08,572
I don't even know if I'll ever find her.

1356
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:09,844
Or if she'll be alive.

1357
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:11,555
But that doesn't mean that...

1358
01:18:11,712 --> 01:18:15,321
...l forget about all these girls like the rest of us.

1359
01:18:15,717 --> 01:18:17,492
And that too after being a police officer.

1360
01:18:18,922 --> 01:18:19,866
You know what, Sir...

1361
01:18:20,323 --> 01:18:24,034
The day our police force gets emotional and works for these girls,

1362
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,738
...nobody will dare to harm them.

1363
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,642
Enough, Shivani!

1364
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:31,113
I agree that we have arrested a drug dealer...

1365
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:33,611
...and drugs worth lakhs because of you.

1366
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,587
But now allow us to take over from here.

1367
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:37,847
ls that clear?

1368
01:18:38,282 --> 01:18:39,192
Sir, why us all the time?

1369
01:18:39,316 --> 01:18:40,596
Shivani, please don't worry.

1370
01:18:40,622 --> 01:18:41,720
We'll take care of it.

1371
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,629
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1372
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:44,529
Thank you, Sir.

1373
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:28,392
- Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1374
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:30,960
I asked since when do you drive an auto.

1375
01:19:31,052 --> 01:19:32,828
Past four or five years.

1376
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:35,599
- Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1377
01:19:35,759 --> 01:19:37,967
- There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1378
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:00,635
She escaped!

1379
01:20:34,939 --> 01:20:35,542
Hello?

1380
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,878
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1381
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,002
About what, Miss Shivani?

1382
01:20:39,028 --> 01:20:39,705
The case is shut.

1383
01:20:40,113 --> 01:20:42,059
- Hear me out.
- Okay.

1384
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:45,690
We share the smallest details of our life...

1385
01:20:45,987 --> 01:20:48,969
...with our girlfriend boyfriend or spouse, right?

1386
01:20:49,459 --> 01:20:51,234
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1387
01:20:51,427 --> 01:20:51,963
Correct!

1388
01:20:52,162 --> 01:20:53,470
So Vakil will also have someone like this.

1389
01:20:53,897 --> 01:20:55,468
Nobody came to claim his body.

1390
01:20:56,234 --> 01:20:57,179
Because of fear of interrogation.

1391
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,243
Tell me what's your point.

1392
01:21:00,507 --> 01:21:02,077
Vakil must surely have someone.

1393
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:03,582
Maybe not a wife.
But someone.

1394
01:21:04,345 --> 01:21:06,952
She will surely know whom Vakil worked for.

1395
01:21:08,551 --> 01:21:09,343
It seems possible.

1396
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:10,556
But how will we find her?

1397
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:13,361
Whatever you found on Vakil's body...

1398
01:21:13,524 --> 01:21:15,903
...gun, pant, shin, wallet, anything.

1399
01:21:16,128 --> 01:21:16,868
Get everything.

1400
01:21:18,531 --> 01:21:19,839
We'll definitely find a clue.

1401
01:21:20,234 --> 01:21:21,736
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1402
01:21:22,069 --> 01:21:23,344
How can get it out of office?

1403
01:21:23,404 --> 01:21:26,045
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1404
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:28,488
You will get me in trouble Miss Shivani.

1405
01:21:29,346 --> 01:21:32,351
I was so worried getting these things out of office.

1406
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:35,989
Honestly whatever we are doing is illegal.

1407
01:21:36,956 --> 01:21:38,162
Always by the book.

1408
01:21:39,092 --> 01:21:42,632
How will you arrest criminals if you keep working by the law?

1409
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:46,640
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't get involved in this any further.

1410
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,384
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1411
01:21:50,574 --> 01:21:51,519
Please, Ma'am.

1412
01:21:52,443 --> 01:21:54,924
Okay, okay.
We'll cross the bridge when we get there.

1413
01:21:55,114 --> 01:21:57,755
What bridge?
There's nothing here!

1414
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:07,404
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1415
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:10,275
That's surprising.

1416
01:22:10,434 --> 01:22:13,279
In an era of readymade, this guy wore stitched clothes!

1417
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:14,780
Classic old school.

1418
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:18,348
Someone who stitches his trousers and shirt form the same tailor...

1419
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:20,717
...is most likely to get all his clothes stitched from him.

1420
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:22,558
Where is Modern Tailors?

1421
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,120
- Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1422
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:26,791
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1423
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:28,493
- From here?
- Yes.

1424
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:30,299
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1425
01:22:32,264 --> 01:22:33,903
I am a social worker.

1426
01:22:33,929 --> 01:22:36,033
I am attached with AIIMS.

1427
01:22:36,904 --> 01:22:40,250
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1428
01:22:40,508 --> 01:22:43,490
I know him for the past 23 years.

1429
01:22:43,913 --> 01:22:47,157
Was this an accident or some police case?

1430
01:22:47,651 --> 01:22:49,188
I don't know that.

1431
01:22:49,454 --> 01:22:52,595
My job is to find out if he has any relatives.

1432
01:22:53,727 --> 01:22:57,039
I don't know of any relatives.

1433
01:22:57,798 --> 01:23:00,336
But there is a lady with whom he was acquainted with...

1434
01:23:00,402 --> 01:23:01,904
...for the past many years.

1435
01:23:04,374 --> 01:23:08,153
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1436
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:12,622
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance with her was still strong.

1437
01:23:13,587 --> 01:23:16,090
Then she should know about his death.

1438
01:23:16,357 --> 01:23:17,233
Where does she stay?

1439
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:21,072
- Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1440
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:24,640
Yes?

1441
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:25,947
ls Minu Rastogi here?

1442
01:23:26,437 --> 01:23:27,074
Who are you?

1443
01:23:27,906 --> 01:23:29,817
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1444
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:31,013
Please come in.

1445
01:23:31,477 --> 01:23:33,480
- Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1446
01:23:34,748 --> 01:23:35,488
Harish...

1447
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,461
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1448
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,101
Get this medicine.

1449
01:23:46,764 --> 01:23:47,538
Yes, Ma'am.

1450
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,208
Please sit.

1451
01:23:50,904 --> 01:23:52,747
- Sugar?
- One spoon.

1452
01:23:54,809 --> 01:23:55,810
I have diabetes.

1453
01:23:56,812 --> 01:23:59,157
My doctor has completely banned sugar for me.

1454
01:24:00,349 --> 01:24:01,259
You are young.

1455
01:24:03,954 --> 01:24:05,093
- Here...
- Thank you.

1456
01:24:06,892 --> 01:24:11,172
How did Mr. Vakil's fame reach the Mumbai police?

1457
01:24:12,999 --> 01:24:13,808
It's a long story.

1458
01:24:14,435 --> 01:24:17,076
I have a lot of time.

1459
01:24:19,009 --> 01:24:20,886
- Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1460
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:23,182
- Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1461
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,194
If I find it later, you know I'll shoot you, right?

1462
01:24:26,384 --> 01:24:26,953
Yes.

1463
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:29,666
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1464
01:24:32,259 --> 01:24:33,295
Go do your work.

1465
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:39,611
Actually...

1466
01:24:40,904 --> 01:24:43,215
I hadn't sent Harish to get medicine.

1467
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,623
I had sent him to see if there are cops outside.

1468
01:24:48,448 --> 01:24:50,018
No, no, I have come alone.

1469
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:58,294
O God, strange are your ways!

1470
01:24:59,797 --> 01:25:02,972
The person my son is looking for in the whole city...

1471
01:25:03,568 --> 01:25:05,271
...is sitting right here in his own house.

1472
01:25:05,297 --> 01:25:06,268
And that too all alone!

1473
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:15,451
That boy who calls you, is my son. Karan.

1474
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,596
What do you call him?

1475
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:23,662
The kid.

1476
01:25:25,965 --> 01:25:26,909
This is his house.

1477
01:25:29,103 --> 01:25:30,515
What's happening to you?

1478
01:25:31,272 --> 01:25:32,148
Feeling dizzy?

1479
01:25:32,808 --> 01:25:36,848
Oh yeah... I put sedatives in your tea.

1480
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,125
Now you won't be capable of doing anything.

1481
01:25:45,191 --> 01:25:48,799
And my Karan will be back in some time.

1482
01:25:51,633 --> 01:25:53,580
You killed Vakil, right!

1483
01:25:55,973 --> 01:25:58,716
My Karan will torture you to death.

1484
01:26:02,014 --> 01:26:03,118
What fun it'll be!

1485
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,306
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1486
01:26:24,144 --> 01:26:24,679
Hey...

1487
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:29,484
I am Walt.

1488
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,626
Actually my name is Karan.

1489
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:36,764
But I have changed it to Walt.

1490
01:26:39,464 --> 01:26:42,071
It's the name of the hero in an English show.

1491
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:45,451
So you did keep your promise.

1492
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,517
You found me on the 27th day.

1493
01:26:49,211 --> 01:26:51,317
That's amazing.

1494
01:26:54,151 --> 01:26:55,187
Congratulations!

1495
01:26:56,087 --> 01:26:57,716
I will keep my promise too.

1496
01:26:57,742 --> 01:26:58,889
I won't kill you.

1497
01:27:00,827 --> 01:27:02,431
I'll just bring you to a state...

1498
01:27:02,495 --> 01:27:04,840
...where you'll beg me to kill you.

1499
01:27:07,469 --> 01:27:08,470
You!

1500
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:30,542
Mom, what's for lunch?

1501
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,517
Are all the girls ready?

1502
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:39,652
Alka, you are on what's app again!

1503
01:27:40,013 --> 01:27:41,322
- Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1504
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,156
I'll get them ready in just five minutes.

1505
01:27:44,252 --> 01:27:48,201
How many times have I told you that don't doll them up like kids?

1506
01:27:48,724 --> 01:27:52,538
Those rascals should see their lovers in them not daughters.

1507
01:27:52,964 --> 01:27:54,739
Honey, please.
Thank you.

1508
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,674
Open your mouth...

1509
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:57,881
Properly...

1510
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:00,450
Good girl!

1511
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:06,683
That's good.

1512
01:28:07,517 --> 01:28:09,794
And don't behave like a fool there.

1513
01:28:10,354 --> 01:28:11,526
Be sexy!

1514
01:28:12,123 --> 01:28:12,965
Good girl!

1515
01:28:13,024 --> 01:28:14,800
Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1516
01:28:15,127 --> 01:28:16,765
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1517
01:28:17,296 --> 01:28:20,472
Remove the pins.
Quick. Quick.

1518
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:21,702
Thank you.

1519
01:28:22,537 --> 01:28:23,778
Look at that.

1520
01:28:27,143 --> 01:28:29,249
Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1521
01:28:29,547 --> 01:28:30,787
- Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1522
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:32,038
And put on a smile.

1523
01:28:32,064 --> 01:28:33,252
Keep it down.

1524
01:28:33,318 --> 01:28:34,730
- Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1525
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,958
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1526
01:28:36,022 --> 01:28:37,262
She's very strong.

1527
01:28:37,524 --> 01:28:39,834
- Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1528
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:42,537
Who is she?

1529
01:28:43,332 --> 01:28:44,208
I don't know.

1530
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:47,539
- Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1531
01:28:48,338 --> 01:28:49,622
ls everyone ready?

1532
01:28:49,648 --> 01:28:51,072
Alka, anyone left?

1533
01:28:51,376 --> 01:28:52,685
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1534
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,417
Should I take them downstairs?

1535
01:28:54,514 --> 01:28:56,516
No, no! I am going to perform here now.

1536
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:57,755
Everybody please wait and watch.

1537
01:28:58,219 --> 01:29:00,564
Come on.
Get out and be ready.

1538
01:29:00,756 --> 01:29:02,429
- Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1539
01:29:02,524 --> 01:29:04,004
Come on.
You foreigner, come on.

1540
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,134
Get out.

1541
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:09,034
- Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1542
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,408
She's not asking you.

1543
01:29:11,369 --> 01:29:13,941
Julia, there's no movie being shown here.

1544
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:15,781
Go.

1545
01:29:16,376 --> 01:29:17,583
Go, or else I'll slap you!
Go!

1546
01:29:17,612 --> 01:29:18,283
Go!

1547
01:29:20,949 --> 01:29:22,521
We still have to deck her up.

1548
01:29:22,547 --> 01:29:23,956
Get her out of the sack.

1549
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,055
- Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1550
01:29:26,757 --> 01:29:28,531
Ma'am, please co-operate.

1551
01:29:28,557 --> 01:29:30,754
Why are you fighting so much?

1552
01:29:31,263 --> 01:29:34,074
Hang on, hang on.
There, it's open.

1553
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,549
Hold it Madam.
Cool down.

1554
01:29:37,906 --> 01:29:38,611
Get lost!

1555
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:40,151
Listen girl!

1556
01:29:40,976 --> 01:29:44,186
I have been doing this since before you were even born!

1557
01:29:44,548 --> 01:29:46,893
I know exactly how to tame the likes of you!

1558
01:29:47,485 --> 01:29:48,624
Just untie my hands and see...

1559
01:29:49,088 --> 01:29:52,935
...you won't have a tongue left to speak or eyes to see!

1560
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:55,567
Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

1561
01:29:55,963 --> 01:29:56,907
Don't hit the face.

1562
01:29:57,365 --> 01:29:58,844
_ Auntyl
- pyaari!

1563
01:29:59,467 --> 01:30:00,606
Hey! Wait!

1564
01:30:01,704 --> 01:30:02,843
- Aunty! Please!
- Pyaari!

1565
01:30:04,007 --> 01:30:05,592
Please, please!
Let her go!

1566
01:30:05,618 --> 01:30:06,673
Let me meet her.

1567
01:30:07,011 --> 01:30:08,389
Once, just once.

1568
01:30:08,847 --> 01:30:10,394
I'll do whatever you say.

1569
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:11,410
Do my make-up.

1570
01:30:12,285 --> 01:30:15,392
Saw Mattu!
That's how you fix such dames!

1571
01:30:16,624 --> 01:30:17,467
Get your make-up done.

1593
01:30:26,938 --> 01:30:28,646
I slapped her hard.

1594
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:31,485
Pyaari...

1595
01:30:42,493 --> 01:30:44,097
All this is because of me.

1596
01:30:45,831 --> 01:30:46,775
NO, Aunty!

1597
01:30:48,635 --> 01:30:50,615
I am alive because of you.

1598
01:30:55,677 --> 01:30:57,551
Enough of this nonsense!

1599
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:58,980
Enough! Stop it!

1600
01:31:00,717 --> 01:31:03,392
Stop this emotional melodrama.
Come on!

1601
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:05,664
Aunty, no!

1602
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:07,634
- You have to get your make-up done.
- Take her away!

1603
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:09,037
<i>Aunty!</i>

1604
01:31:12,933 --> 01:31:14,140
Now, it's looking beautiful.

1605
01:31:16,873 --> 01:31:17,874
Hi, darling!

1606
01:31:22,313 --> 01:31:24,088
Oh hi! Long time.

1607
01:31:26,585 --> 01:31:27,825
Take good care of them, sweety.

1608
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:30,933
Please come, Sir!

1609
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:32,900
The whole arrangement is especially for you.

1610
01:31:33,194 --> 01:31:33,900
Thank you.

1611
01:31:34,096 --> 01:31:35,131
Everything is ready, Sir.

1612
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:36,001
Sir...

1613
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,901
Hi, good evening.

1614
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:40,204
Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come?

1615
01:31:40,638 --> 01:31:42,395
He will come at his own time.

1616
01:31:42,421 --> 01:31:43,873
Oh yes.
 Of course!

1617
01:31:44,075 --> 01:31:45,214
You first show me your arrangements.

1618
01:31:45,311 --> 01:31:46,688
- Please come, Sir.
- Sir, your phone...

1619
01:31:46,779 --> 01:31:47,743
Angie, baby, wait.

1620
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:50,014
Right now he's just checking things out.

1621
01:31:50,351 --> 01:31:51,353
He'll come later.

1622
01:31:52,087 --> 01:31:52,622
Come, Sir.

1623
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:54,032
Security is very tight.

1624
01:31:54,323 --> 01:31:56,166
It's for your benefit, Sir.

1625
01:31:56,493 --> 01:31:58,939
Only when there's no fear of being photographed...

1626
01:31:59,497 --> 01:32:01,534
...can a person enjoy freely.

1627
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:05,408
Julia, come, baby.

1628
01:32:06,039 --> 01:32:08,646
Come, come, for Sir.

1629
01:32:09,243 --> 01:32:10,689
Don't be shy. Sir...

1630
01:32:18,956 --> 01:32:21,335
Girls get abducted in our cities for free...

1631
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:22,971
In broad day light.

1632
01:32:25,365 --> 01:32:29,337
But when one guy sets up a small organized business...

1633
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:31,010
...and everyone gets upset!

1634
01:32:33,309 --> 01:32:35,118
Why did you do all of this?

1635
01:32:36,147 --> 01:32:37,182
What did you get?

1636
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:43,726
You women get personal too soon.

1637
01:32:46,026 --> 01:32:49,338
I agree that you are a cop, from the crime branch.

1638
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:51,876
But to obsessively chase just one criminal?

1639
01:32:51,968 --> 01:32:53,949
What kind of professionalism is this?

1640
01:32:55,105 --> 01:32:56,312
Where did you learn this?

1641
01:32:57,508 --> 01:32:58,350
Nonsense.

1642
01:33:00,145 --> 01:33:06,757
That's why we men climb on top and you women just stare at the ceiling.

1643
01:33:07,689 --> 01:33:09,828
You know what I am saying, Miss Shivani?

1644
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:14,605
The night is young.

1645
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,612
Stare at the ceiling and scream your lungs out.

1646
01:33:18,436 --> 01:33:19,472
Scream?

1647
01:33:25,179 --> 01:33:25,850
Scream.

1648
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:37,673
That's right.

1649
01:33:39,532 --> 01:33:40,533
There's no point.

1650
01:33:45,373 --> 01:33:46,818
Crime branch!

1651
01:33:58,658 --> 01:33:59,534
Sir has come.

1652
01:34:04,966 --> 01:34:06,114
Good evening, Sir.

1653
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,097
This is Mattu!

1654
01:34:07,303 --> 01:34:08,441
- Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1655
01:34:08,504 --> 01:34:09,676
- How are you?
- All good.

1656
01:34:09,772 --> 01:34:11,514
Everything's ready for you.

1657
01:34:14,145 --> 01:34:15,123
Welcome, Sir!

1658
01:34:15,715 --> 01:34:17,524
- All well?
- With your blessings.

1659
01:34:17,783 --> 01:34:19,024
- Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1660
01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:20,291
Wait here.

1661
01:34:25,527 --> 01:34:26,232
Come, Sir.

1662
01:34:27,697 --> 01:34:28,607
Come, Sir.

1663
01:34:28,865 --> 01:34:31,039
Tandon, have you checked everything personally?

1664
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,010
Yes, Sir.

1665
01:34:32,102 --> 01:34:34,379
You are bound to be happy with the arrangements.

1666
01:34:36,942 --> 01:34:37,943
Come, Sir.

1667
01:34:39,146 --> 01:34:40,682
- Everything's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1668
01:34:41,883 --> 01:34:42,987
Sir, to your left.

1669
01:34:51,495 --> 01:34:53,134
The arrangements look great.

1670
01:34:54,032 --> 01:34:56,570
Yes. You are the one who gave us the opportunity to serve you.

1671
01:34:56,903 --> 01:34:59,282
There's a special gift for you in the suite upstairs.

1672
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,145
You should check it out if you are in the mood.

1673
01:35:01,643 --> 01:35:02,678
Everybody knows.

1674
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:05,183
Be it the opposition or women...

1675
01:35:05,714 --> 01:35:07,922
...l am always in a mood to crush!

1676
01:35:09,019 --> 01:35:10,647
Spoken like a true leader!

1677
01:35:10,673 --> 01:35:12,550
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1678
01:35:22,404 --> 01:35:23,109
Hello!

1679
01:35:25,374 --> 01:35:26,752
I have heard a lot about you.

1680
01:35:29,414 --> 01:35:30,017
You?

1681
01:35:31,182 --> 01:35:33,254
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1682
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:37,028
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1683
01:35:37,691 --> 01:35:39,137
I am sure even you do.

1684
01:35:40,061 --> 01:35:41,040
My hobby is this.

1685
01:35:42,431 --> 01:35:44,275
Have you really come to rape me?

1686
01:35:44,701 --> 01:35:47,239
I don't know how one pretends to rape.

1687
01:35:47,705 --> 01:35:49,571
You fight with all your strength.

1688
01:35:49,597 --> 01:35:51,008
Only then it'll be fun.

1689
01:36:09,668 --> 01:36:10,738
You want to rape me!

1690
01:36:12,805 --> 01:36:15,047
Get up!
Come on!

1691
01:36:19,214 --> 01:36:20,386
Stop this party!

1692
01:36:20,683 --> 01:36:21,991
Get out!

1693
01:36:22,184 --> 01:36:23,219
What is happening?

1694
01:36:23,554 --> 01:36:25,261
Walt, where the hell are you?

1695
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:26,628
- Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1696
01:36:26,758 --> 01:36:28,237
Where did she come from!

1697
01:36:28,693 --> 01:36:29,695
She has lost it!

1698
01:36:32,332 --> 01:36:35,906
Karan Rastogi, do you want this minister alive or not?

1699
01:36:36,637 --> 01:36:38,174
Tandon!
Do something, Tandon!

1700
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,980
Mattu, wait!

1701
01:36:39,575 --> 01:36:41,522
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1702
01:36:41,711 --> 01:36:44,215
...you and your mom will die a miserable death.

1703
01:36:44,648 --> 01:36:45,519
One second, Ma'am.

1704
01:36:45,545 --> 01:36:46,415
What do you want?

1705
01:36:46,918 --> 01:36:49,365
I want all the girls out.

1706
01:36:49,922 --> 01:36:50,946
What are you staring at, Alka?

1707
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:51,825
Send all the girls out.

1708
01:36:52,059 --> 01:36:52,867
- Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1709
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:53,936
Mattu, are you dead!

1710
01:36:54,863 --> 01:36:56,740
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1711
01:36:56,931 --> 01:36:57,569
Hurry up!

1712
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,610
Fast.

1713
01:36:59,235 --> 01:37:00,145
Fast, girls! Fast!

1714
01:37:00,504 --> 01:37:01,380
Hurry up, Alka.

1715
01:37:02,372 --> 01:37:03,408
- Pyaari, wait.
- Aunty.

1716
01:37:04,242 --> 01:37:05,152
- Mattu!
- Yes?

1717
01:37:05,310 --> 01:37:07,257
Give the key of the mobile locker to Pyaari.

1718
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:08,651
Give her the damn key.

1719
01:37:12,753 --> 01:37:13,959
You got the girls.

1720
01:37:14,388 --> 01:37:15,129
What else do you want?

1721
01:37:15,624 --> 01:37:16,227
You.

1722
01:37:16,825 --> 01:37:17,736
You will come with me.

1723
01:37:21,765 --> 01:37:23,268
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1724
01:37:23,368 --> 01:37:25,143
- Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1725
01:37:25,503 --> 01:37:27,984
- Help!
- Raise your hands.

1726
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:32,984
Tell them that no one moves from here till you get back.

1727
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:34,107
Nobody moves from here.

1728
01:37:34,133 --> 01:37:35,220
Tandon, keep him in check.

1729
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:35,929
You wait.

1730
01:37:36,385 --> 01:37:38,423
Everybody, we have got a bit of a situation.

1731
01:37:38,555 --> 01:37:39,863
I am going to son it out and be right back.

1732
01:37:40,257 --> 01:37:41,736
Raise your hands!
Move!

1733
01:37:42,693 --> 01:37:43,468
Move!

1734
01:37:44,863 --> 01:37:45,466
Come on.

1735
01:37:47,934 --> 01:37:49,812
Move quickly!
Look ahead.

1736
01:37:53,942 --> 01:37:55,684
Damn! She has locked the door!

1737
01:37:56,612 --> 01:37:57,318
Come on quickly.

1738
01:37:57,414 --> 01:37:59,257
Aunty, but the exit is this side.

1739
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:00,426
We are not going out.

1740
01:38:01,152 --> 01:38:01,687
Open it!

1741
01:38:05,959 --> 01:38:08,030
Open! Get in.

1742
01:38:08,963 --> 01:38:11,034
Come on, girls.
Get in.

1743
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:14,139
Be there.

1744
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:17,584
Pyaari, close the door.

1745
01:38:19,209 --> 01:38:21,281
Lock the door. Lock it!

1746
01:38:32,461 --> 01:38:33,769
- Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1747
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:35,004
Get in!

1748
01:38:37,468 --> 01:38:38,828
Not bad, Ma'am.

1749
01:38:38,854 --> 01:38:40,304
Not bad at all.

1750
01:38:40,739 --> 01:38:43,744
You guys think we cops are morons, right?

1751
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:47,786
But how did you manage to do this?

1752
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:50,726
When I got the address to your place...

1753
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:53,257
...l had no clue that it is your house.

1754
01:38:53,823 --> 01:38:54,973
Where is D-40?

1755
01:38:54,999 --> 01:38:57,297
Second from the front.

1756
01:38:57,561 --> 01:38:59,974
In crime branch we are trained to...

1757
01:39:00,332 --> 01:39:04,338
...carefully scan a place before entering.

1758
01:39:04,771 --> 01:39:08,152
- Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1759
01:39:10,145 --> 01:39:11,318
Who else stays with her?

1760
01:39:11,514 --> 01:39:13,516
Her son and a servant.

1761
01:39:14,151 --> 01:39:15,129
How old is the son?

1762
01:39:15,352 --> 01:39:16,764
Around 25-26.

1763
01:39:16,921 --> 01:39:20,802
I was wondering what to do next when I heard a sound.

1764
01:39:23,296 --> 01:39:25,800
Maybe God was trying to tell me something.

1765
01:39:26,434 --> 01:39:29,439
I had heard this Azaan before.

1766
01:39:29,838 --> 01:39:30,782
But where?

1767
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,817
Then I remembered.

1768
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:35,255
But you can't do any harm to me.

1769
01:39:35,946 --> 01:39:36,823
Because I am still alive.

1770
01:39:36,882 --> 01:39:38,623
And I am comfortably sitting in my own house.

1771
01:39:39,385 --> 01:39:45,338
That is the first time I wondered if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1772
01:39:46,894 --> 01:39:48,704
But then who will take a risk with you?

1773
01:39:49,031 --> 01:39:51,911
I began watching your house.

1774
01:39:52,335 --> 01:39:53,838
I spotted you the next day.

1775
01:39:54,471 --> 01:39:55,711
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1776
01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:59,916
But one look at your sly face...

1777
01:40:00,413 --> 01:40:01,357
...and I knew it had to be you.

1778
01:40:02,048 --> 01:40:05,054
The first thing I did was put a GPS tracker in your car.

1779
01:40:07,288 --> 01:40:09,769
48 hours went by...

1780
01:40:14,298 --> 01:40:16,836
...you didn't go to any of your hostels or warehouses.

1781
01:40:17,636 --> 01:40:18,876
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1782
01:40:19,172 --> 01:40:20,776
...and also the other girls.

1783
01:40:21,808 --> 01:40:24,848
Even if we did arrest you, what could we charge you with?

1784
01:40:25,847 --> 01:40:28,454
That's when I decided that there's no point wasting time.

1785
01:40:28,751 --> 01:40:30,458
Now you yourself will take me to Pyaari.

1786
01:40:31,355 --> 01:40:34,667
I entered your house but I was fully prepared.

1787
01:40:34,993 --> 01:40:37,201
I just had to make the move at the right time.

1788
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:45,783
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1789
01:40:46,108 --> 01:40:49,283
He'll track us on the GPS and come here with the police unit.

1790
01:40:50,548 --> 01:40:52,528
Pyaari, get the phone.

1791
01:40:53,685 --> 01:40:55,562
And what if I would have killed you right then?

1792
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:59,200
I had to take that risk.

1793
01:41:00,861 --> 01:41:03,536
Like I said, I knew your type.

1794
01:41:04,299 --> 01:41:06,177
You wouldn't kill me that easily.

1795
01:41:06,635 --> 01:41:09,344
You would want to exploit me like other women.

1796
01:41:11,342 --> 01:41:13,550
I must give it to you.
 But what now?

1797
01:41:13,746 --> 01:41:15,657
Sodhi, come.

1798
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:20,898
The police will take at least 25 minutes to get here.

1799
01:41:21,355 --> 01:41:24,200
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1800
01:41:24,961 --> 01:41:28,500
And I am standing in between you and your freedom.

1801
01:41:30,133 --> 01:41:31,807
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1802
01:41:34,573 --> 01:41:36,554
Women... women...

1803
01:41:38,278 --> 01:41:40,418
Take everything personally, right?

1804
01:41:41,349 --> 01:41:42,124
Come on.

1805
01:41:43,051 --> 01:41:47,729
Let me see how far on top a man can climb.

1806
01:41:48,826 --> 01:41:49,531
As you wish.

1807
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:12,268
<i>Aunty!</i>

1808
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:23,779
Get up! Get up!

1809
01:43:00,823 --> 01:43:01,850
Hit me, Ma'am.

1810
01:43:01,876 --> 01:43:03,853
How much will you hit me?

1811
01:43:07,766 --> 01:43:12,045
You will me hit me a little and then arrest me, right?

1812
01:43:14,841 --> 01:43:16,879
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1813
01:43:18,981 --> 01:43:20,119
This is India.

1814
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,564
Over here, if you have the right contacts...

1815
01:43:25,824 --> 01:43:29,068
...the biggest of scandals can be buried.

1816
01:43:30,564 --> 01:43:32,567
This is trivial in comparison.

1817
01:43:33,801 --> 01:43:36,510
So till then you hit me and have fun.

1818
01:43:37,539 --> 01:43:38,712
Hit me, Ma'am.

1819
01:43:39,742 --> 01:43:41,245
There is nothing else you can do.

1820
01:43:42,046 --> 01:43:43,024
This is India.

1821
01:43:49,255 --> 01:43:51,395
This one thing you are right about.

1822
01:43:52,327 --> 01:43:53,271
This is India.

1823
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:55,204
'This' is what goes on here.

1824
01:44:00,036 --> 01:44:03,884
These people sitting outside will bury your crime?

1825
01:44:04,409 --> 01:44:08,415
They can do it only if you reach the police station.

1826
01:44:09,383 --> 01:44:13,230
But you won't reach the police station because this is India.

1827
01:44:13,488 --> 01:44:16,698
Here, if you don't want to bother the court too much...

1828
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:18,931
...issues can be settled this way.

1829
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,240
Get up!

1830
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,448
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1831
01:44:30,945 --> 01:44:32,926
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1832
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:36,527
Get up!

1833
01:44:45,965 --> 01:44:48,207
Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'.

1834
01:44:51,372 --> 01:44:52,443
What's your plan?

1835
01:44:55,378 --> 01:44:56,550
Are you going to murder me?

1836
01:44:58,549 --> 01:45:00,119
In front of everyone?

1837
01:45:03,155 --> 01:45:04,328
This is India.

1838
01:45:05,057 --> 01:45:07,561
In India, if 50 people take the law in their hands...

1839
01:45:07,661 --> 01:45:10,506
...and kill someone, then it's not called a murder.

1840
01:45:10,932 --> 01:45:12,674
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1841
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:30,863
From right now, never again will I let you crush my pride

1842
01:45:31,192 --> 01:45:36,200
You can have my body slain but you can't have my soul tied

1843
01:45:46,414 --> 01:45:51,057
From right now, never again will I let you crush my pride

1844
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:56,303
You can have my body slain but you can't have my soul tied

1845
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,011
Touch my heart and I promise you will mean the world to me

1846
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:03,681
But if you ever mess with me

1847
01:46:03,737 --> 01:46:06,309
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1848
01:46:08,811 --> 01:46:11,588
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1849
01:46:26,835 --> 01:46:31,718
If you think being a man gives you the right to sell me like cattle

1850
01:46:31,908 --> 01:46:36,585
I will in that same place destroy your entire race

1851
01:46:36,914 --> 01:46:41,262
Hold my hand and walk with me and I will never leave your side

1852
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:44,100
But if you ever mess with me

1853
01:46:44,191 --> 01:46:46,798
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1854
01:46:49,266 --> 01:46:52,009
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1855
01:47:07,022 --> 01:47:12,098
In a skin or a saree, at day or at night I will not walk afraid

1856
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:17,281
I won't lead a life full of fear and regret

1857
01:47:22,444 --> 01:47:27,292
In a world where mothers and sisters are not a blessing but a curse

1858
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:32,299
I will break all shackles of rules belonging to this world

1859
01:47:32,557 --> 01:47:37,133
Change the way you look at me and I will shield you from the evil eye

1860
01:47:37,297 --> 01:47:39,676
But if you ever mess with me

1861
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:42,611
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1862
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,994
Walt died on his way to the hospital.

1863
01:47:52,484 --> 01:47:55,955
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1864
01:47:56,422 --> 01:47:59,701
He revealed everything about Walt,

1865
01:47:59,794 --> 01:48:02,172
Minu and Vakil along with Tandon's involvement to the court.

1866
01:48:03,899 --> 01:48:06,471
First, the girls made up Minu's face.

1867
01:48:06,903 --> 01:48:08,178
And then God did.

1868
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:10,476
Minu later suffered a paralysis attack.

1869
01:48:14,981 --> 01:48:17,792
Taneja survived and is now in Tiharjail.

1870
01:48:18,252 --> 01:48:21,723
His scarred face is an amusement to most in the jail.

1871
01:48:26,997 --> 01:48:30,947
Today, we could bring back the smile on Pyaari's face.

1872
01:48:31,236 --> 01:48:34,684
But there are many like Pyaari that have to be rescued from this muck.

1873
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:38,080
Many others like Karan Rastogi who are still scat-free...

1874
01:48:38,379 --> 01:48:39,586
must be stopped.

1875
01:48:39,948 --> 01:48:41,928
The Mardaani (Fighter) that's hidden within...

1876
01:48:42,084 --> 01:48:44,827
has to be discovered by every woman, every girl herself.

1877
01:48:45,289 --> 01:48:47,235
The war is still on.
