1
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:16,548
'Greetings! Welcome to the Newshour!'

2
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:19,748
'Special Team has been set up'

3
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:22,098
'to trace Inspector
Rajendran of'

4
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:23,988
'Gummudipundi J7 Police Station'

5
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:26,378
'who went missing mysteriously
two days ago.'

6
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,848
'The team will begin investigation'

7
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:31,458
'after they get cue on whether'

8
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:33,238
'the Inspector
is abducted or murdered.'

9
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:35,028
'The missing Inspector Rajendran'

10
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:38,378
'was working on capturing
a drug mafia.'

11
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,038
Brother!

12
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:43,886
Come before me.

13
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,028
Sorry, Brother.

14
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:55,128
The pain is killing me.

15
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,338
If you continue to
taunt me like this

16
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,998
I'll smash you to the ground!

17
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:01,518
Do you follow?

18
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,857
Whatever it is face me
and say it.

19
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,185
Sure, Brother.

20
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,078
Brother, Bhai is here.

21
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:20,368
Bhai?
- Yes!

22
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,508
You!
- Don't, Bhai!

23
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:23,798
I will drop dead with
just a gentle touch!

24
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:26,338
You are no Collector or Judge
to corner a Police officer!

25
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:30,418
A smuggler should never react.
Staying calm is the key!

26
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,158
Only if you respect the cops,
you will be successful in trade.

27
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,718
Whereas you have laid
hands on a top cop!

28
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:38,168
I did try, Bhai.
The cop didn't budge.

29
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:39,888
In fact, I even fell at his feet.

30
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:41,818
But, he strangled my neck.

31
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,468
It was a narrow escape.

32
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,454
Do you even realize it?

33
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,900
The Doctors told me that
my spine is severely damaged.

34
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:50,874
Where is he?

35
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,660
Bhai, he is not aware of
who brought him here.

36
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:07,189
Do we drop him off at
some far-off place?

37
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:17,410
What have you done?

38
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:19,738
Who is this?

39
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:21,090
Inspector Rajendran!

40
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:24,816
He looks very different.

41
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:28,004
Looks like you've
had a solid party!

42
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:32,728
If you spare a cop

43
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,827
he will target us for
the rest of his life!

44
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:41,738
Will it be heard outside?
- No, Bhai. You carry on!

45
00:03:44,498 --> 00:03:48,088
Bhai, wait till I close
the windows.

46
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,031
"As per my statement"

47
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,057
Don't you want me to come?
Step out of the way.

48
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:08,628
'We will apply for the bail'

49
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,428
'Sir, don't leave him. '

50
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:12,588
'You should never spare
someone like him. How dare you?'

51
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,248
'What audacity!'
'Where is it?'

52
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:16,918
'Sir, he is responsible for it.'
- 'He might confide, sir.'

53
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:18,768
I know! - Sir, I heard a new
Inspector is taking charge.

54
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:20,338
I did ask Rajendran sir

55
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,348
to take it easy.
He could have gone places.

56
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,418
But, he was a man of principles.
Poor thing, he has gone missing!

57
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,710
Please pray the new Inspector
is not like Rajendran sir.

58
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:30,608
I am sure all of you
are praying hard!

59
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,728
Like you have a choice!

60
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:33,148
Hey!
- I meant I've brought your ‘Tea,’ sir.

61
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:35,398
Lord Ganesha, please save us.
- 'Take that!'

62
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,818
The new inspector should accept
bribe and take good care of me.

63
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:40,938
Sir, take a break. Have this tea
and bash him later.

64
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,568
Who should I give this to?
- The new Inspector.

65
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,778
What? Is he here already?

66
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,118
I am the new Inspector.
Give it to me.

67
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:07,894
What is this, sir?

68
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:10,789
You promised to give me
an increment of Rs. 8,000 this year.

69
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,700
But, you have offered only Rs. 200.

70
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:15,668
Like I told you earlier, let's meet
outside if you want to

71
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,838
discuss your increment.

72
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,488
You don't seem to have time for it.

73
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,648
Why should we meet outside to
discuss official matter?

74
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,068
No! Only when we meet outside

75
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:29,918
I can gauge your needs and
decide on your increment.

76
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,111
I can talk to GM accordingly!

77
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,200
So, you tell me when you are free.
We'll meet up.

78
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,914
If that is the case, then why
should I meet you, sir?

79
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:47,269
I would rather meet GM
and take your posting.

80
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:50,668
If you get sacked from this job

81
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:53,494
even your wife will refuse to meet
you. I hope you understand.

82
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:57,449
Don't be surprised, sir.
Focus on your family!

83
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,208
Did you actually say it?
- Yes!

84
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:13,458
So, you've lost your job?

85
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:15,984
Yes!
Since eight hours ago!

86
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:24,558
Mom!

87
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:26,602
This man has engaged
in a brawl again!

88
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,818
His clothes are torn!

89
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:30,828
Don't let him in.
Ask him to get out!

90
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:32,688
Don't you hear her?
Get out!

91
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,988
Go! Get out!
- Hey!

92
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:35,858
You are too small to
understand all this.

93
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,798
Mom, this man in not listening to me.
He's barging in.

94
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:40,528
Hey, don't eat my ‘Dosa’!
- He has been the same throughout!

95
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,838
I cannot stand this
torture anymore.

96
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,218
Don't you have any shame? Leave.
- Hey!

97
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:45,598
- Get lost!
- Stop it!

98
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,318
Dad, come in.
What happened?

99
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,388
Sit down! Tell me what happened.
- Gosh!

100
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:54,078
Nothing new! He'll present the old
wine in a new bottle.

101
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:56,028
Mom, please stay calm.

102
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:58,068
Tell me, Dad.
What happened?

103
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:01,488
Nothing, dear.
I was just fighting for justice.

104
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,818
Yeah right! He thinks he is
Mahatma Gandhi

105
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:05,308
to reinstate justice!

106
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,588
He never stops to think about
the three women at home.

107
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:09,069
I am going to
burn you with this!

108
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,748
Go on, Mom!
- Both of you please stop it.

109
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,966
Dad, what is it?

110
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:16,198
The ATM was very crowded today.

111
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:17,988
A rascal tried to cut the line!

112
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:20,168
I tried to stop him.
But, he caught hold of my shirt.

113
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:22,730
I got furious and
almost punched his ear.

114
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:25,982
But, I missed it by an inch.

115
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:28,502
He punched me on my stomach
before I could punch him.

116
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,138
An unexpected blow.
I slipped and fell down.

117
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,418
Jeez! Don't waste your time listening
to his crappy stories.

118
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,888
Get back to work.
- There's no hurry, Mom.

119
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:39,938
She has lost her job.
- What?

120
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,028
Did you lose your job?

121
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:45,288
"I think of you, when I am happy!"

122
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:46,948
The joker is back in action!

123
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,358
I wonder where he is going
to get bashed today!

124
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:50,658
Hey Anand!
- Yes.

125
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,248
I am definitely going
to say it today.

126
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:54,708
Since three months, I have been
trying to give signals.

127
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,088
But, she doesn't seem to catch it.
Do you know why?

128
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,748
She never looks at you
to catch the signal.

129
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,108
Correct! So, I am going to meet
her face to face

130
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,028
and seek her hand in marriage.

131
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,518
Wonderful, Brother.
- I know!

132
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,626
"A lot of maidens are
interested in me."

133
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,038
Brother!
- Yes?

134
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:13,318
What, dude? Are you going
to say 'All the best'?

135
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,468
I suggest you stand three feet apart,
when you confess your love to her.

136
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:18,138
She might slap you.
- Thanks, Buddy.

137
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,578
He checks the mirror ten times a day.
Yet, he does not realize.

138
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:25,008
Don't leave the
rotten tomatoes here.

139
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,328
I get tempted to
hit you with it. Idiot!

140
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,018
Let me come back and deal with you!

141
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,638
Get lost, you monster!

142
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,448
What a waste of time!

143
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,348
She walks with her
head down always.

144
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:37,208
Excuse me, I want to
talk to you.

145
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,858
Do you know the Sekar Stores
that is beside your house?

146
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,778
Yes!
- I am Sekar, the proprietor!

147
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:46,237
I am sure you will understand the
problems of every boy at my age.

148
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,398
Are you suffering from
diabetes or BP?

149
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:50,827
That's been taken care of.

150
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:53,728
The moment I go home,
my dad asks me to get married.

151
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,128
My mom wants me to marry
a cousin of mine.

152
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:58,768
My grandma yearns to
see great grandchildren!

153
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:01,218
I come to shop to get away
from all this. Here, I'm tortured

154
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:05,458
by a swarming crowd of girls.
But, my reply remains the same.

155
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,888
I will not marry anyone else except
the girl of my dreams.

156
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:11,048
I have never told anyone
who the lucky girl is.

157
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,562
For the first time,
I am going to disclose it to you.

158
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:44,161
Didn't I tell you that
she'll look at me?

159
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:45,387
Hey, do you have eggs I am asking you.
What are you looking at?

160
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:47,323
Here, take the egg!

161
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:13,074
Uncle, do you want to be an umpire?

162
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,369
Happy Birthday!

163
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:15,905
But, it's not my birthday today.

164
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,250
I know. It is my birthday.
Please wish me.

165
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,821
Happy Birthday!

166
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:15,538
And you are the girl of my dreams!
- Sir!

167
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,668
Please don't say this to
anyone else, sir.

168
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:19,508
My parents are weak-hearted.

169
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,848
They are old. I don't want anything
untoward to happen.

170
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:23,700
What will happen?

171
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:26,018
I am scared, sir.

172
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,955
Am I destined to
lead a disastrous life?

173
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:32,028
Don't worry. I won't commit suicide.

174
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:33,336
Suicide?

175
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:42,028
To begin with, I can offer you
Rs. 22,000 as salary.

176
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:45,688
If you bring in more business
as promised

177
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:48,848
I'll give you an incentive
after six months.

178
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:51,758
If you agree to the terms,
you can report to work on Monday.

179
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,118
I agree, sir. I'll join from Monday.
Bye, sir.

180
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:57,238
Thank you!

181
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,408
Dad!
- Step out, dear.

182
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,478
We shouldn't discuss personal
stuff inside office premises.

183
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:13,348
Tell me now!

184
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,468
I've brought your lunch.

185
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,138
Dear Kokila!

186
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,908
Mom had called me.

187
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,668
I heard you got a job.
- Yes, Dad.

188
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:22,328
I have got a job
at a massage parlour.

189
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:23,658
I have to report to
work from Monday.

190
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,222
No, dear. We'll soon have to
get you married.

191
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:29,878
Do you think taking a job at
a massage parlor would be appropriate?

192
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,938
Dad, I am not going to
do the massage.

193
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,288
There are therapists to do it.

194
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:36,168
I am the Manager of the Spa.

195
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,387
I understand, dear.
But, the groom's side may

196
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,338
insist on knowing the reason
for you to take this job.

197
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:44,238
This job pays me Rs. 8,000 more
than my previous job.

198
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:46,778
That's the reason and
I am in dire need of that 8,000.

199
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,748
Need I say more?
Please get back to work.

200
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:50,238
Fine!

201
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:04,048
"Why did she come close to me?"

202
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:10,107
"What made her go away from me?"

203
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:16,132
"No matter what happens,
even if I have to lose."

204
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:18,798
Hey, why did you stop it?

205
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,318
I've got a complaint from a customer.
- About what?

206
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:23,838
The betel leaf is torn!

207
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,258
Do you want me to stitch it up?

208
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:28,098
Do you think the customer will return,
if you talk so irresponsibly?

209
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:29,738
Let me take a look
at our valuable customer.

210
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:32,148
Do you think he'll stay
alive till tomorrow?

211
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,056
With this attitude of yours.

212
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,678
Take this betel leaf, Grandpa.
Hold it carefully.

213
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,088
Anand!
- What is it?

214
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,818
Anand!
- What do you want, dude?

215
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:44,161
I've been meaning to tell
you something for a long time now.

216
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:47,318
I find it hard to hold back.

217
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:48,548
Can I just spit it out?

218
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,638
Hurry up! I have a lot
of work to do.

219
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:54,578
Anand, I showed a picture of
Kokila to my grandma

220
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,348
and told her that I was
going to marry this girl.

221
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,878
Do you know how
my grandma reacted?

222
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,758
Did she call you a
heartless beast?

223
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:01,638
Yes! How did you know?

224
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:02,898
Any sane person
would react like that.

225
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:04,868
Hey!
- Wait! Let me demonstrate it to you.

226
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,568
What are you going to do?
- Look at that girl!

227
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:08,778
Wow! What a beauty!

228
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:12,698
Now, when I turn to look at
you Yuck! A beast!

229
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:14,463
Hey!

230
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:16,122
Did you get paid this month?

231
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,318
You said you'll pay tomorrow, Brother.

232
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:18,998
At this rate, you'll have
to suck your thumb for next month.

233
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,822
That's far better than
working for you. - You rascal!

234
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:25,584
Kokila!

235
00:15:25,664 --> 00:15:27,848
Don't jump. You hair might
get stuck in the fan!

236
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:31,198
Such a negative soul!
Do your work!

237
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,648
Thank you, sir. - Why did you pay
him Rs.2000 for a bunch of tapioca?

238
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:48,898
I paid him for the information
and not for tapioca!

239
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:50,808
Sir, what information can
he possibly give?

240
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,378
No Government employee
gives proper information.

241
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,618
So, I pay people like him
to get the information.

242
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:57,248
Sir, please give me Rs.1000.

243
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:59,688
You give me information first.
I'll pay Rs.1000 then.

244
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,998
Give me some Tapioca at least, sir.
- Enjoy!

245
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,718
Is it this house?
- Yes, Uncle.

246
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,538
Do you think they'll be home?
- Yes.

247
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,848
'God, if everything goes well,
I'll offer what I promised.'

248
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:25,368
Hey, what do you think
you are doing?

249
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,128
Come after me!

250
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:34,228
Greetings!
My name is Remo Kumar.

251
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:37,088
I head Actor Sivakarthikeyan's
fan club in Tiruvallur district.

252
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,668
I am his uncle. Our boy's name is
Lakshmana Kumar.

253
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,002
It is LK, uncle! LK! LK!

254
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:44,148
Hold it!
- Sorry, Uncle! Sorry! Sorry!

255
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:47,738
LK, Lakshmana Kumar all the same!

256
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,658
Our boy is fond of your
younger daughter!

257
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,408
I am here to discuss it.

258
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,238
She is going to school!

259
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,568
How can you seek a
student for marriage?

260
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:00,838
She's in College, Uncle!
College! College! College!

261
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:02,258
He says she's in college.

262
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,048
School, college all the same, sir.

263
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:05,958
We have no intentions of
interrupting her studies now!

264
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,508
I'll take care of that, Uncle.

265
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,138
I'll do anything to help
her finish studies, Uncle.

266
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:10,218
I'll make sure she comes
out in flying colors, Uncle.

267
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:12,018
I promise to make her a Doctor,
a Collector or an Engineer, Uncle.

268
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,538
Please tell them, Uncle. - Hold on,
dear. The elders are discussing.

269
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,848
Forgive me, Uncle. Sorry! Sorry!
I didn't mean to interrupt you!

270
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:19,092
Pardon me, Uncle! Sorry! Sorry!
My bad!

271
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:23,458
I am sure he will take
good care of her. - I will, Uncle.

272
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:26,868
I will keep her happy. I'll lay
a bed of roses for her to walk on.

273
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:30,694
To keep her safe, I will pick
thorn after thorn after thorn.

274
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:34,018
Enough with the thorns! Even your
parents refused to go with you.

275
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:36,448
Only uncle has come to support you!
- Indeed, Uncle.

276
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:37,618
So, please show some respect.

277
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:40,848
God! I've disrespected you, Uncle.
Forgive me! Sorry! Sorry!

278
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,188
What a fool I am! How can you
disrespect your uncle?

279
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,848
'You have no brains!'
- Can I ask you something?

280
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:45,542
Yes!

281
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:47,368
If you had a daughter
- 'You fool! You fool!'

282
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:49,456
will you get her married to a
- 'How could you do this, you fool?'

283
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,528
a guy like this?
- 'Forgive me, Uncle! I am sorry!'

284
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:55,268
'I have disrespected my uncle!
How dare I disrespect elders?'

285
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:58,218
'Mistake!
Grave mistake! What an idiot!?'

286
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:00,948
I won't, Madam.
You don't have to agree too!

287
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:01,771
Good!

288
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:03,898
It's my mistake to have come
with this marriage proposal!

289
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:05,458
I'll take your leave.
- Uncle!

290
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:07,788
What do you want? - None of
you seem to understand my love.

291
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:11,418
One fine day, when this family is
in trouble, only I'll come to help.

292
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,628
That day,
Shobi will realise my love for her.

293
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,608
Shobi's sister Kokila,
you will understand my love for her.

294
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,458
Shobi's mother..
Aunt, may I know your name?

295
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:19,988
You will realize it.
- Get out of here!

296
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,728
Hello, you'll have to collect
mom's report from the hospital at 12.

297
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,428
Don't forget.
Take mom along!

298
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,948
Take an auto!
Don't go by bus. Understood?

299
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,176
Okay, bye!

300
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,448
Thank you!
- Welcome!

301
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,758
Ma'am, how did you
like the massage?

302
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:47,308
Whoa!

303
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,228
The way she massages
with the oil

304
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:52,338
is simply amazing!

305
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:55,688
That's good, Ma'am. Your body and
mind will feel refreshed at all times.

306
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:58,838
You seem to understand.
Whereas, my husband

307
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:01,508
feels I will land up
in streets because of this.

308
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,458
How much do I pay?

309
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,618
Rs.1950 only!

310
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:07,738
Take it!

311
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:12,098
Ma'am, for best results
come twice in a week.

312
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:12,941
I wish the same, dear.

313
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,068
But, it takes 50 minutes
to reach here from home.

314
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:16,678
I end up feeling extremely tired.

315
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:19,168
Please inform if you have
any special massage packages.

316
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:21,168
Definitely, Ma'am.
- But, mind you!

317
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:23,488
I must feel relaxed after the massage.

318
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,658
I don't want them
to leave me hanging!

319
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,185
It irritates me!

320
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,346
Hello! Tell me, Shobi!

321
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,598
Shobi!

322
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:46,838
What happened?

323
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,738
Lung cancer, madam.

324
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:53,728
It is in second stage.

325
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,563
It's quite a serious problem. You will
have to take good care of her.

326
00:19:56,768 --> 00:20:00,778
There are a lot of advanced treatments
now. So, it is definitely curable.

327
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:03,218
But, the treatments are
quite expensive.

328
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:06,017
They could cost you
around Rs.1.2-1.5 Millions.

329
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,193
You have one month's time.

330
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:12,399
Until then,
we can treat her with tablets.

331
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,188
But, we'll have to begin the
treatment after a month.

332
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:18,288
Otherwise, nothing is in
our hands!

333
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:23,168
Whether you stay awake or sleep
I have only three months' time.

334
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:38,408
My only wish is to
see you both married

335
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,668
and spend time
with my grandchildren!

336
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:43,708
Given the situation

337
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:46,488
I don't think
I'll live to see all that.

338
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,078
Your dad is an innocent man!

339
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,828
Please take good care of him.

340
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:58,438
Have you decided that I won't
be able to save you?

341
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:01,572
You need Rs. 1.5 Million to save me.

342
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:04,638
With that Rs. 1.5 Million

343
00:22:04,718 --> 00:22:08,458
I can host both yours and
your respective children's weddings.

344
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:10,498
I will turn the world around
with that money!

345
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,638
So, if you spend
Rs.1.5 Million to save me

346
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:16,188
I will probably die of guilt.

347
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:20,358
Please don't do
anything stupid.

348
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:24,498
Henceforth, you must save

349
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,893
every penny you earn
for yourself.

350
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:30,757
You are only worried because
I am a girl. Right?

351
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:33,435
Wait and watch!
I'll definitely save you.

352
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,218
What do you want?

353
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:54,028
It would be great if you could help
us sell this property in two days.

354
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:57,138
I'll need three days
to even locate this place.

355
00:22:57,548 --> 00:23:01,268
Oh! Then, I'll mortgage the property
with you. You lend us money.

356
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:02,550
How much do you expect?

357
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:06,478
The property will fetch
Rs. 2.5-3 Million, if I sell it.

358
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:11,108
I see! - But, it isn't fair to
expect so much in mortgage.

359
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:13,778
So, Rs.1.5 Million 
would be ideal, sir.

360
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,588
What have you got in that bag?

361
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,188
Nothing, sir. I brought this bag
to carry the cash bundles.

362
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,868
Will I fit in it too?

363
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:25,034
Sir!
- What do you expect?

364
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:26,738
This land won't fetch
anything more than a Million

365
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:29,018
and you demand Rs.10- Rs. 1.5 Million!

366
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:31,148
We are in dire need of money, sir.
Quite urgent.

367
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:33,298
Look, dear. I am seated now.

368
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,448
Do you know how difficult
it is for me to get up?

369
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:40,076
You won't understand my problems.
Likewise, I won't understand yours.

370
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,748
Hello!
-'Hey Kittu!'

371
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:54,538
'Police have entered the premises.'

372
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,198
'Hide the package and run away.'

373
00:23:57,638 --> 00:23:59,998
'It's fine if you are caught.
But, safeguard the package.'

374
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:02,471
Sure, Brother!
I'll do as you say.

375
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,508
Why are you staying here?

376
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,538
Which College? For how long
have you been staying here?

377
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:31,868
But, we find it hard to believe.

378
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,778
Hey, who is that?
Don't go. Wait!

379
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:35,388
Hey! Stop running.
- Catch him!

380
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:37,908
Don't let him go.
- Catch him.

381
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:43,178
Stop running!

382
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:52,858
Sorry, sir!
I am really sorry, sir.

383
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,168
What did you do?

384
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:55,878
Sir, let me go.
- Why did you run away?

385
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,498
Why did you try to escape?
- Please let me go, sir.

386
00:24:57,578 --> 00:24:58,918
No problem!
He is an accused.

387
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,188
Is he hurt, sir?

388
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:02,038
He'll be fine.
Find an auto for them. Go!

389
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:03,598
Come along, Madam.
- Let's go, Sister.

390
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,708
Get up!
Up!

391
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,378
Are you the one trading drugs here?
- No, sir.

392
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,598
Where have you hid the drugs?
- I don't know, sir.

393
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:11,198
Where is the package? Tell me.
- Trust me, sir. I don't know.

394
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:13,418
'Form a line! Come on!'

395
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:14,988
Yes, sir.
- 'What happened?'

396
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:16,378
We've caught the accused, sir.

397
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:19,098
But, he has hidden
the package.

398
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:20,608
'Lock up the lodge and conduct
a thorough search!'

399
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:22,838
'Don't let anyone out.' - Yes, sir.
I'll do a thorough checking.

400
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:24,808
I will definitely return
with the package.

401
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,048
Okay, sir!

402
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:34,538
Sister!

403
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:37,118
It's fine if we get
just Rs. 1 Lakh from it.

404
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:40,548
Let's sell the property.
We'll use the money

405
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:44,268
to keep mom happy
for next one or two months.

406
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:58,258
Hey Tony, isn't it your sister's
birthday tomorrow?

407
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:00,338
What does she like?

408
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,528
Why do you ask me? I'm not the one
having an affair with her.

409
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:05,128
You are her lover.
So, find it yourself.

410
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:08,618
Hey, drive faster.
You have no sense of timing.

411
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:16,028
'What do you want?'

412
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,008
How many times did
I warn you to stay calm?

413
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:20,158
We can just stay quiet, Bhai.

414
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:22,248
That Guru is forever
targeting us.

415
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:25,428
We've been caught five times so far.
'We have a loss of Rs.10.5 Million.'

416
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,688
If he gets hold of the
package this time..

417
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:30,178
..you will be liable
for that Rs. 2.5 Million!

418
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:31,448
Don't worry, Bhai!

419
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,318
I'll handle it.
It's my responsibility.

420
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:49,548
Sister, please step down.

421
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,238
You don't have to panic.

422
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:54,208
Think of me as your brother!
Get down!

423
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:55,538
Come!

424
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:01,008
Get going! - Do you want
to get dropped here, Madam?

425
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,398
Go on, dude!

426
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,228
Didn't you just get someone arrested?

427
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,658
Sir, we didn't get him arrested.

428
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:11,018
I just opened the door and
he banged against it.

429
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:13,968
Maybe! According to us,
you got him caught!

430
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,828
But, that's fine.
We'll handle it.

431
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:19,158
Our package is stuck in the lodge.
You'll have to bring it for us.

432
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:21,808
Sir, why should we bring it for you?

433
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:23,648
Since you got our staff arrested

434
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:25,118
it is your duty now Further

435
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:29,108
you are the only one who can exit
the lodge without Police search.

436
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:32,388
No, sir.
We will not do it.

437
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:35,748
I am not giving you a choice, dear.

438
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:38,868
You hand over the package
and take your sister back.

439
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:41,938
Tony, take the sister
away and buy her ice-cream!

440
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:43,638
Darling, follow him!

441
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,958
Tony, get going!
- Little one, follow Tony!

442
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,828
Babu!

443
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:50,348
Hide the gun!

444
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:55,188
Please leave, sir.
- Come!

445
00:27:55,418 --> 00:27:56,668
Do you want a cup or a cone ice-cream?

446
00:27:56,868 --> 00:27:59,168
Murthy, find an auto.

447
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,958
I can't let you in now.
- I forgot a document here, sir.

448
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:07,648
Let me just go take it.
- No! This place is under search.

449
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:08,968
I cannot let anyone in! Please wait.
- Sir, I

450
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:10,358
I will come immediately.
- No way! Please go!

451
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,498
Hey Murugan!
- Sir, please!

452
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:13,978
What is the issue? - She says
she left a document here, sir.

453
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:15,603
She wants to take it.
- Send her in.

454
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:21,278
'Open the other bag!'

455
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,468
What do you have in here?

456
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:57,558
What's in the bag?
Lift up your hands!

457
00:28:58,548 --> 00:28:59,718
What do you have in your
back pocket? And the front?

458
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:00,938
Check their bags!

459
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,098
Check it!
- What's inside that cover?

460
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,438
Hey, come here.

461
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,658
Hey girl, I'm calling you.
Come here.

462
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:09,218
Bring that girl here.
Open the bag!

463
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:11,318
Hey, come forward.
Sir is calling you!

464
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:15,076
Come..

465
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:17,817
Go..

466
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:24,448
You are the one who came
to take the document, right?

467
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:28,078
Why are you standing in the queue?
Leave!

468
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:44,598
Sir!
- Come!

469
00:29:50,308 --> 00:29:52,888
I'll turn around!
You take the package.

470
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:55,408
Why should you turn, sir?

471
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:58,798
I am sure you have hidden the
package under your dress.

472
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:00,798
No, sir.
I hid it in my lunch box.

473
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:04,298
Lunch box?
Let me see!

474
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:11,656
Whoa!

475
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:18,578
They search men
till the last garment.

476
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:20,308
But, they are quite lenient
with women.

477
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:22,488
Go!
- Sir!

478
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:24,868
Can I have my box?

479
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,098
Do you want it back?

480
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:29,888
Dude, do we have any
bag here?

481
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,778
What I am about to
tell you is very important!

482
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,308
Please listen to it carefully!

483
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:47,118
As soon as you step out of the car,
you go your way and I'll go mine.

484
00:30:47,198 --> 00:30:49,728
You've never heard of me!
Do you follow?

485
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:51,998
Go!

486
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:08,878
What do you want?
- Give me 700 bucks!

487
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,868
For what occasion?
- You asked me to have ice-cream!

488
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,438
Ice-cream!

489
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:16,558
How many ice-creams, sir?
- 33!

490
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,738
33!

491
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:20,228
How many did the girl have?

492
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:21,478
She refused to have any ice-cream.

493
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:24,228
It's quite expensive, right?
Should I shoot him down?

494
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:26,758
Give me the gun!

495
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:29,578
Go pay him!
- I've lost my purse.

496
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:31,278
You get lost too!
- Start the car!

497
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:34,188
Babu!

498
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:39,888
As if we didn't have enough troubles,
there is one more to handle.

499
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:42,778
It's fine. It turned out to be a
blessing in disguise.

500
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,037
How so?

501
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:51,498
What is this? - This belongs to the
man who stood guarding me!

502
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:54,598
Why did you take his purse?
- There was a lot of money in it.

503
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,508
I felt like taking it, so I did.

504
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,618
That's wrong! - Given our
situation, nothing is wrong.

505
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:02,338
Stealing from a rogue like him
is definitely not wrong.

506
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:03,738
Give it to me!

507
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,168
Is he eying Kokila's house?
Let me join the party!

508
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,758
Hey, who are you?

509
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:32,535
You got biscuits for a penny and have
been eying that house for hours!

510
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,758
I'm LK, Brother.
- LK?

511
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:37,778
Does it stand for Lord Kumar?
- Lakshmana Kumar, Brother.

512
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,458
So?

513
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:41,848
I trust you like an elder brother and
would like to confess something

514
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:44,278
I'm in love with a girl
in that house.

515
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:46,468
Anand!
- What do you want, dude?

516
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,038
Look at this joker!

517
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:52,228
I've spent Rs.1 Million in setting up
a shop near her house!

518
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:55,708
Whereas you invest Rs.10 on biscuits
and dare to ogle at my girl.

519
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:59,158
What are you doing?
- I'm a college student, Brother.

520
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,468
It's been four years since
Kokila completed college.

521
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,688
But, her sister is still in college.

522
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:05,988
Really?
- Yes!

523
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,998
So, are you in love with her sister?
- Yes, Brother.

524
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:09,298
Is it?

525
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,098
Do you know who my lover is?
- Yes, Brother.

526
00:33:11,178 --> 00:33:12,588
Who is it?
- You are in love with the elder one!

527
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,958
How did you guess? - The elder one is
a perfect match for your personality!

528
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:17,698
Yuck! - Come in, Brother.
Pull a chair for him.

529
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,668
Come in, Co-Brother!
Let's bond.

530
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,578
Here, sign this document.

531
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,758
What is this?
- Cylinder Name Transfer form.

532
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,148
What is the need
for this now?

533
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:30,541
It will be easier, if we do
this, while I am alive.

534
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:32,730
They'll make you run
from pillar to post!

535
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,153
Sign this!

536
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:35,413
I have a better idea.

537
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,779
I'll dig up a six-foot pit
and bury you.

538
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:38,799
You can leave in peace.

539
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:40,859
Stop taunting me like this.

540
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:43,122
Sign this and leave it on the table.

541
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,559
How old is your mother, dear?

542
00:33:52,936 --> 00:33:54,029
Sixty two, Ma'am.

543
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:55,459
Look there!

544
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:58,479
That kid is only three years old.

545
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:01,999
He is suffering the
same ailment as your mother!

546
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:04,629
There are about
25 kids like him

547
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,089
and each one of
them is in critical stage.

548
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:10,019
We don't have enough
funds for their treatment.

549
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,439
Only after we help these children

550
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,619
we can think of helping someone
at your mother's age.

551
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,309
Hey! Excuse me.
Just a minute.

552
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:49,359
NGOs cannot help
people in need at all times.

553
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:52,069
They are bound by rules
and regulations.

554
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,509
There are a lot of genuine
philanthropists out there.

555
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:58,450
I felt really sorry, when I heard you
talk about your mother.

556
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,519
Mother means everything to us!

557
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:02,779
If you are really
looking for help

558
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,199
please visit this
address tomorrow.

559
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:10,197
But, call before you come.

560
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:13,209
Do you follow, dear?
- Yes, sir. Thanks a lot!

561
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:24,769
Did you take a good look, sir?

562
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:26,819
Are you happy, sir?

563
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:28,609
Can we finalize the deal?

564
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:31,189
Yes! Go ahead!

565
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:32,899
Tell me, when you need it.

566
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,089
Sir is a true gentleman.

567
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:43,959
He is ever ready to
help people in trouble.

568
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:47,935
Just like you
he has certain needs too.

569
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:50,309
He expects you
to fulfill them.

570
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:52,399
Yes, sir. What should I do?

571
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:54,474
Sir owns a beach house.

572
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,269
You must visit the same,
whenever he calls for you.

573
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,600
This is not a compulsion.

574
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,868
Please don't think we
are forcing you.

575
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:08,053
Accept only if you are
comfortable with it.

576
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:10,189
I can promise one thing though.

577
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:12,451
We'll make sure your identity
remains confidential.

578
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,730
We are people with high influence.

579
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:16,749
If you agree

580
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:18,949
come to this address

581
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,899
on Saturday.

582
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,709
Please give it a
good thought, dear.

583
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:32,729
You got to save
your mother.

584
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:42,059
It is definitely curable.
But, the treatment is quite expensive.

585
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:44,357
It can cost around
Rs.12- Rs. 1.5 Million.

586
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:53,699
What are you doing?
- Can't you see?

587
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:57,189
Are you practicing for later,
when I am gone for good?

588
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,199
As long as I am alive,
I will do the cooking.

589
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,729
Go mind your business!

590
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:02,669
Fine! Do it yourself.

591
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:03,969
Just don't talk like this.

592
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:08,239
Let's say I agree to
give you Rs.1 Million.

593
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,205
But, what if you
fail to repay it?

594
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,589
We'll be the losers then.

595
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:15,539
We can remain relatives

596
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:17,289
as long as we stick to
basic greetings and courtesies.

597
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:32,829
Why do you need Rs.1 Million, dear?

598
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:35,019
Also, it's only ten days
since you joined work.

599
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,959
The best I can do is
to increase your monthly salary

600
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,819
by Rs. 2,000!

601
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:55,519
Kokila!

602
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:58,293
There is not a single good picture
of four of us together.

603
00:38:58,549 --> 00:38:59,759
Can we please click a
picture together?

604
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,329
There is no hurry though.

605
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,769
You carry on!

606
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,659
Sir, hold on!

607
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:24,049
Please smile!

608
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:06,269
Not just one, you equal the
strength of ten men!

609
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:10,529
Can't you see it?
Don't you feel it? Look properly!

610
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,619
Go farther beyond!
You will see it.

611
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:16,561
You'll see the light!
The light at the end of the tunnel!

612
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:18,030
Go for it, Girl!

613
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:28,227
Babu, that girl is here.

614
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:29,839
Which girl?

615
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,690
The girl who delivered drug
from the mansion.

616
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,259
Oh! What does she want?

617
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:38,208
She wants her commission for
bringing the drug.

618
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,219
Commission?

619
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:42,139
Don't worry. Document clear. I have
done a background check already.

620
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,389
Her dad works as
a watchman at the ATM.

621
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:45,049
Her mom is a patient and
her sister goes to College.

622
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,789
No problem. If there's any trouble,
we'll have full control over her.

623
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:49,979
In fact, even now she will leave if
you refuse to give her the commission.

624
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:53,589
Tony, something is wrong.

625
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:56,247
We'll have to find out how the
girl managed to reach us here.

626
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,059
Call the boys!

627
00:40:58,139 --> 00:40:59,589
We don't need the boys for it.

628
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:01,259
I'll explain it to you!

629
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,009
How?

630
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:05,249
Didn't I tell you that I misplaced
my purse? She brought it back.

631
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,804
I have four visiting
cards in my wallet.

632
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,959
She is a very good girl and
has left the money intact.

633
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:24,189
Hand over this money to that
girl and send her away.

634
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:25,239
Fine!

635
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:37,169
She says 1% of 2.5 Million 
is Rs.25,000.

636
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:38,590
But, you have given
her only Rs. 5,000.

637
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,079
Who told her the drug
was worth Rs. 2.5 Million?

638
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,089
I did!
- Babu!

639
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:47,159
Let me remind you of
your affair with my sister.

640
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:48,729
Be careful!

641
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,669
Go! Go, bring her!

642
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:23,849
Here's the Rs. 25,000 you asked.

643
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:29,049
That day, you rushed to
save your sister.

644
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:30,639
I am paying you this as token of
appreciation for your family values!

645
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,629
Hey, you said something.
What was it?

646
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:34,749
Document clear!

647
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,029
Her dad is an ATM watchman, mom a
patient and her sister is in College.

648
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,979
No problem. If there's any trouble,
we'll have full control over her.

649
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,409
We are waiting for your order!

650
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:45,338
Did you hear that? They have
your complete history now.

651
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:46,399
They are rogues of the first order!

652
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:47,569
Don't interact with them!

653
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,359
You shouldn't be coming
to a place like this.

654
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:51,279
Leave! Iyer, last month..
- Sir!

655
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,959
If you have any job, I'll take it up.

656
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,989
Babu, like I told you earlier, her
dad is an ATM watchman

657
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:00,979
her mom a patient and her
sister goes to College.

658
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:04,369
Stop doubting me! Else, you'll
have to face a different Tony!

659
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:07,879
Sir, don't worry.

660
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,649
I'll do as you say and deliver the
package wherever you ask me to.

661
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:16,855
Hey Tony, this girl thinks we are
engaged in a wrong trade.

662
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,908
What do you think was in the
package that you brought earlier?

663
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:20,699
It's imported 'Rangoli' powder.

664
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:22,849
You cannot use it here though!

665
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:24,009
If you did, cops
will arrest you!

666
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:25,111
Are you nuts, Babu?

667
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:28,418
You threatened her with a gun that day
and now you call it 'Rangoli' powder.

668
00:43:28,498 --> 00:43:31,019
Nor do we look like people who are
engaged in 'Rangoli' powder trade.

669
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:34,240
That girl is aware of everything
including your green color underpants.

670
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:35,389
True, sir!

671
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:37,419
No, sir.

672
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,239
I mean, like he mentioned.

673
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,009
Her dad is an ATM watchman, mom a
patient and her sister is in college.

674
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,019
If there's any trouble,
we'll have full control over her.

675
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:47,499
It's up to you now!

676
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,939
No matter how much
we groom our boys

677
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,839
that Inspector nabs
them with their bad odor!

678
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,039
With this girl, we'll be able to
get away from the inspector.

679
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,279
She looks like an angel indeed!

680
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:03,529
Trust me!
She looks very docile and innocent.

681
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:07,479
If she delivers successfully,
we'll be the next Pablo Escobar!

682
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:11,659
Ask her to come!

683
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:24,789
Hey Babu!

684
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:26,679
Is this truly a business setup

685
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:29,199
or are you trying for a setup
with her? - No, Mohan!

686
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:30,689
I cannot divorce my wife!

687
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:34,029
Pablo is my only aim! I see her
as a fellow professional.

688
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:37,827
But, I do feel excited even when I
look at her as a fellow Professional.

689
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,049
Even that nosy Inspector
Guru will not suspect her!

690
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:48,499
Bring a chair!

691
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,799
Hey, get up!

692
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:55,149
Fatso!

693
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:01,409
Sit down!

694
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:07,539
Hey, all of you step out!

695
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:10,189
Jeez! They won't let us sit in peace.

696
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,976
They don't let me play Candy Crush
for more than two minutes!

697
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:16,064
I better have 'Pongal'
and go to sleep!

698
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:20,617
I don't trust anyone easily!

699
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:23,530
Despite realizing the
risk in the job

700
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:25,439
you have agreed to take it up.

701
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,119
Give me one good reason for it.
Only then I will accept.

702
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:33,409
I believe one can work efficiently
only if they have good reason for it.

703
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:39,709
The cops don't attack you directly.

704
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,459
They'll do it when
you least expect it.

705
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:46,568
Two months ago
an Inspector tried to nab me.

706
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:48,045
But, I killed him!

707
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:49,394
That's a different story though!

708
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,329
Self-defense is very important.

709
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,849
So, why do you want to do this?
Give me one good reason.

710
00:45:56,529 --> 00:45:57,579
Mom..

711
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:00,899
What?

712
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:02,469
Like I explained

713
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,159
her mother is suffering
from stage -II cancer.

714
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:06,419
I need money for her treatment.

715
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:17,749
Fine! Come and collect
the package tomorrow.

716
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,269
Hello! - 'Today a new recruit will be
bringing the package.'

717
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:33,409
'Collect it!'
- What?

718
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:37,049
A new recruit! We are no lovers
to keep changing partners.

719
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:38,669
Safety is our priority!

720
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:42,219
Instead of acting in haste you can ask
Nirmal to deliver late!

721
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,279
Who is Nirmal?

722
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,849
'Just an example, Buddy!'

723
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:47,069
Kumar will turn when you
call him a monkey!

724
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:49,109
But, a monkey won't turn,
if you call him Kumar!

725
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:51,369
Neither will it turn,
when you call it a monkey!

726
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:52,919
You may beat me at wordplay!

727
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:55,079
But, you can't feed off it!

728
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:57,049
My neck is paining! Bye!

729
00:46:57,959 --> 00:46:58,859
Loser!

730
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,649
Give me a slice of watermelon!
- Sure, sir

731
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:05,328
We are going to discuss business.
Please leave!

732
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,932
Look who his business alliances are!

733
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:14,021
Fruit vendor,
buttermilk vendor, petty shop guy!

734
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:15,919
How are things here?

735
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,409
Nothing much, sir.
This area is very clean now.

736
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:20,049
There have been no dealings
after you took charge, sir.

737
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:21,759
My foot! I don't like it.

738
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,249
Here, keep this!

739
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:24,189
Thanks, sir.

740
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:26,689
I'll come later.

741
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,332
Come in!
Sit down, please.

742
00:47:54,629 --> 00:47:55,609
What kind of plant
are you looking for?

743
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,846
Herbal or Vaasthu plant?

744
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:00,189
No, sir.
Mohan sir sent me here.

745
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:03,553
Mohan! I don't know anyone
apart from 'Mike' Mohan.

746
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,119
Oh! So, you are the new recruit.

747
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:17,339
Yes!

748
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,709
Give it under the table.

749
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:30,474
Why have you brought it in
a lunch box?

750
00:48:30,534 --> 00:48:31,649
New technique, is it?

751
00:48:33,429 --> 00:48:36,618
Modern methods!
What a wonderful idea.

752
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:48,489
Take it, dear.
- Sir!

753
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:49,749
Give it under the table.
- Oh!

754
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,109
Thank you, sir!

755
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:04,229
She looks very innocent.

756
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:05,819
On the other hand,
she engages in drug trading!

757
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:09,099
Dear Mohan!

758
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,249
You've hit a jackpot by
recruiting this girl.

759
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:13,989
She is innocence personified.

760
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:16,219
'Please find someone
like this for me too!'

761
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:19,251
I am tired managing
these beasts here.

762
00:49:19,629 --> 00:49:21,339
It's time to work with the beauty
and rule the world!

763
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,094
Buddy, hear out my punch line
before you cut the call.

764
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:25,949
Despite having eight legs

765
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,159
a spider will take years to
alight a flight of stairs.

766
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:29,649
But, a rocket worth Rs. 10

767
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:32,179
will zoom in the sky
the moment you light it.

768
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:35,464
I wish your growth
is similar to that of Rs.10 rocket.

769
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:36,269
Bye!

770
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,809
Come here.

771
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:09,749
Give me Rs.5,000. I'll return
it immediately. Quite urgent.

772
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:11,279
I don't have money.
- Stop lying.

773
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:16,151
Call him! If you ever trouble
her again I will kill you!

774
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:23,109
Come in.

775
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:25,161
I have a gut feeling that they
are still trading drugs!

776
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,509
What do you think?
- Not a chance, sir.

777
00:51:27,729 --> 00:51:28,589
Hundred percent!

778
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,949
The City is clean ever
since you took charge.

779
00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:31,949
Get lost!

780
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:37,092
Go from there.

781
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,889
I forgot to tell you. Please inform
immediately, if she vomits blood.

782
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:18,435
If so, we'll have to begin
the treatment within a week!

783
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,168
Sir, there are a lot
of new guys visiting

784
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:05,349
the buildings on my left.

785
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:06,529
Kindly check, sir!

786
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,979
Hey girl, stop. Get inside the jeep.

787
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:41,439
Sir, why should I?

788
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:43,059
Get inside the jeep!

789
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:46,659
Sir, what happened? I.

790
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:48,789
It won't look nice, if I got down.

791
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:49,729
So, you get inside
the jeep on your own.

792
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:54,479
Darling!

793
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:57,469
It's me, dear!

794
00:53:57,589 --> 00:54:00,009
He is my husband.
He was just teasing you.

795
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:01,719
Honey, I think you scared her.

796
00:54:01,799 --> 00:54:03,838
Don't you have any sense?
Look what you have done!

797
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:06,749
I was just playing with you.

798
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:08,179
Don't cry for all this.
- Poor thing!

799
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:10,419
Tell us where you have to go, we'll
drop you there. - Senseless man!

800
00:54:10,499 --> 00:54:11,399
Get in! Come on!

801
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:12,979
Please don't mistake us, dear.
Come in!

802
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:14,269
We'll drop you!

803
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:15,119
Come in, dear!

804
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:18,449
Hey!

805
00:54:20,919 --> 00:54:21,899
Start the car.

806
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:32,029
What are you doing here?
Do you live in this area?

807
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:38,039
I just completed a therapy
session for a client here.

808
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,569
Are you doing
on your own too?

809
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:47,569
We offer home services
for far off clients.

810
00:54:47,649 --> 00:54:48,989
Do you massage too?

811
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,649
There she goes again!

812
00:54:50,729 --> 00:54:51,949
I have completed the course.

813
00:54:53,629 --> 00:54:56,419
For a long time now, I have
a severe neck pain!

814
00:54:56,849 --> 00:54:58,639
I am unable to sit or stand.

815
00:54:59,189 --> 00:55:01,799
I find it difficult to manage.
What do you suggest?

816
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:03,789
It's paining badly.

817
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:07,199
Oh! I'll do it.

818
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:23,879
Sir, I'll get down.
I can take a bus from here.

819
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:25,729
Is your house here? Are you sure
you want to get down here?

820
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,379
Yes, sir. - Couldn't he wait
till I got my massage?

821
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,439
Okay! Hey, stop the car.
- Sir!

822
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:30,129
Okay, sir!

823
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:40,309
Take care, dear!

824
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:41,709
Bye!

825
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:47,999
What is the matter?
You wanted to meet me urgently.

826
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,189
Brother, I plan to offer
a small prayer

827
00:55:49,269 --> 00:55:51,249
at my family deity's temple
for our love to be successful.

828
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:52,629
We'll have to cut four
times on each hand

829
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:55,654
and offer the dripping blood
to the deity! - Hey!

830
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:57,839
In case of bleeding you must meet
a doctor and not a deity!

831
00:55:57,919 --> 00:56:00,099
Don't make fun, Bro! Next, you'll
have to cut four times on your thigh

832
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:02,089
and again offer the dripping blood

833
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:03,959
to deity and call out
Shobi's name. Then.. - You'll die!

834
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,689
By God's grace,
she will be my wife next year, Bro!

835
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:09,269
Buddy, Doctor says the alcohol
content is high in my body.

836
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:10,819
So, I cannot donate blood to anyone.

837
00:56:10,899 --> 00:56:12,909
Now, if I offer it to God,
it will be a huge mistake.

838
00:56:13,379 --> 00:56:14,589
So, I'll call you,
once I am doing fine.

839
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:16,679
Not a problem, Brother. We can draw
the blood from your tummy.

840
00:56:16,759 --> 00:56:17,709
Yeah right! We'll do it later.

841
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:19,249
I'll call you once I am okay,
we'll do as you say.

842
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:20,029
Get going, dude!

843
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:21,259
If you want I can come.
- Not at all!

844
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:22,469
Come only after I call you.

845
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,649
I'll wait for your call.
- Get lost, you needle face!

846
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:29,119
He expects me to puncture
myself for love!

847
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:30,129
Hey Anand!

848
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:32,259
If he comes again,
tell him I am not there.

849
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:33,049
Yeah okay!

850
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:34,949
If he asks, I'll tell him you died!

851
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:38,819
What did you say?
- Fine! I'll tell him you are cremated.

852
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:43,899
He wants the shop for himself!

853
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:58,939
Hello!

854
00:56:59,019 --> 00:56:59,889
Am I talking to the Inspector?

855
00:56:59,969 --> 00:57:01,109
Who are you?

856
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:02,759
I called to help you!

857
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:04,129
Do I have to reveal my identity?

858
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:06,899
Fine! Tell me, sir.
- I did tell my friends

859
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:09,509
that it's very difficult to trade
drugs since Inspector Guru took charge.

860
00:57:09,749 --> 00:57:11,529
I told them he was
wiped the city clean.

861
00:57:11,609 --> 00:57:13,329
But, they laughed!
- Why so?

862
00:57:13,409 --> 00:57:15,609
I heard a girl engaged in the trade
and walks past you everyday

863
00:57:15,689 --> 00:57:18,269
and you don't do anything about it.

864
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:19,549
How is she taking it?

865
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:21,409
In 557F bus!

866
00:57:21,489 --> 00:57:22,539
Do you know the timing of the bus?

867
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:23,439
8:30!

868
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:24,219
Where does she board the bus?

869
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:26,399
Why, I'll hold a seat for you
next to the girl.

870
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:27,439
You can catch her then!

871
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:29,519
If the information
happens to be wrong.

872
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,939
Quick! Go brush and leave.

873
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:33,179
It's already 7:15.
You need to be there by 8:30.

874
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:34,879
Stop sleeping like a buffalo!

875
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:37,849
Useless fellow!

876
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:40,469
'There's going to be a checking here.
Ask everyone to leave. '

877
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:42,799
Don't stop!
Keep going.

878
00:57:42,879 --> 00:57:45,189
Go! Go! Go!

879
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,869
Come aside!
- Stop the bus!

880
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:51,269
Go park there!
- This way!

881
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:53,869
Enough!
Stop here.

882
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,699
Constable, make sure no one
leaves the bus. - Okay, sir.

883
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:00,769
There's a checking.
Please take your bags out!

884
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:03,769
Keep your bags open.
- What is in this box?

885
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:05,409
Lunch!
- Open the bag!

886
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:06,989
Show it!
- What's in it?

887
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:11,479
'Open it!'
- 'What's in this?'

888
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:12,859
'Open this zip.'

889
00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:14,679
Show me your bag!

890
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:16,166
What have you got in this?

891
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,889
Take it out!

892
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:20,159
What's inside this?
- Nothing, sir.

893
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:21,029
'Open the bag!'

894
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,939
'Open it!'

895
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:25,609
Are you waiting for special
instructions? Open the bag!

896
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:28,109
Open the water bottle.
- Open this zip.

897
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,129
Show it!

898
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:37,489
Hurry up!
- Open the bag!

899
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:39,229
What's inside this?
Sir, have you checked here?

900
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:40,339
'Yes, madam. It's done.'

901
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:41,699
'What about that lady?'
- 'Done, madam'.

902
00:58:42,629 --> 00:58:43,509
This girl?

903
00:58:43,779 --> 00:58:45,319
Yes, madam.
- Open the bag!

904
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:47,419
Open it!

905
00:58:47,779 --> 00:58:49,209
I am well acquainted with sir!

906
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:51,989
We are good friends.

907
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:53,579
That's fine.
- Open the bag!

908
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:54,419
Come on, open it.

909
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:00,439
What's inside the lunch box?
Take it out!

910
00:59:00,879 --> 00:59:03,259
Take it out!
- 'Sir, this side is clear!'

911
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:04,709
Open the box!

912
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,009
Open it!

913
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,674
It's just curd rice.
Why did you hesitate to open it?

914
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:32,469
'Hey Mohan, fortunately I was
doing the checking.'

915
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:36,459
'But, if Guru had seen it
you'd be dead by now.'

916
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:38,469
'While I am working
here for you'

917
00:59:38,549 --> 00:59:41,529
I guess someone in your
team is helping Guru!

918
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:44,089
Our boys are not that kind!

919
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:45,889
They are loyal and faithful.

920
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:48,549
'It's time to test their loyalty!'

921
00:59:48,629 --> 00:59:51,209
'First, find who the black
sheep is and finish him.'

922
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,329
'Else, I will be forced
to finish you someday.'

923
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:56,819
'So, please take care.'

924
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:06,499
Look, Kokila. Don't cry.

925
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:08,344
It's not your problem alone!

926
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:09,819
It's a trouble for all of us!

927
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:13,779
No, sir.
I think I am their only target.

928
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:16,279
They did this to get me caught!

929
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:19,149
If they planned to get you caught they
would have given details about you.

930
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:22,539
I am feeling scared, sir.

931
01:00:23,129 --> 01:00:26,539
You won't be scared,
after you see my action now.

932
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:28,909
You'll be able to work
without any tension.

933
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:31,579
Hey Shani!

934
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,042
I have a small doubt.

935
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:50,779
What if you gave them the tip?

936
01:00:55,409 --> 01:00:56,199
Get out!

937
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:07,439
If you come forward and
admit the mistake I'll spare you.

938
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,179
This is not a big deal!

939
01:01:10,419 --> 01:01:12,719
I'll think you did it
out of frustration!

940
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,729
At the end of the day,
we are all one family!

941
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:17,599
Sir, take their phones and
check caller history!

942
01:01:17,899 --> 01:01:19,819
If no one has stepped
out since morning

943
01:01:19,899 --> 01:01:21,909
I am sure they must
have called him.

944
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:25,279
Shani!
- Brother!

945
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:37,639
Whose phone is this?

946
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:39,199
It's mine, Brother. Why do you ask?

947
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,339
Why did you delete
the caller history?

948
01:01:42,419 --> 01:01:44,479
Brother, I am innocent.
I didn't do it.

949
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,849
I don't know how it got deleted.
Brother, please.

950
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:49,009
Trust me, Brother.
I didn't tip the inspector.

951
01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:51,889
I won't do such cheap stuff, Brother.
Please think about it.

952
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:53,549
Don't make a mistake, Brother.

953
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:56,929
I don't know, Brother.
Forgive me! Please!

954
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,659
I swear I didn't do it.

955
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:00,179
Brother!
- Sir!

956
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:03,779
Ask him if someone else took
his phone this morning, sir!

957
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:06,789
Two people borrowed my phone, Brother.

958
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,819
Give me a good reason

959
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:19,419
which proves that
he was the one

960
01:02:19,499 --> 01:02:21,329
who tipped the Police
about this girl.

961
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:26,069
Likewise, you should give
me a reason that this guy did so!

962
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,650
When I am convinced with
one of your reasons

963
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:30,934
I'll kill the other!

964
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:37,179
Instead, if you tried to beat
around the bush

965
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:39,494
I'll kill both of you!

966
01:02:41,529 --> 01:02:42,589
Lord Muruga!

967
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:48,039
Brother, you haven't assigned
us a task since she got here.

968
01:02:48,189 --> 01:02:49,448
He must have done it
out of that frustration.

969
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:52,842
Since there is no work, we don't
have enough funds on hand.

970
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,579
He might have done
it out of that grudge.

971
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:58,759
Brother, a lot of problems arise when
there is a girl in the team.

972
01:02:58,819 --> 01:03:00,289
Maybe that's why he did it.

973
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:03,939
He might have thought
the girl won't fit the job

974
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,869
and will land us all
in trouble someday.

975
01:03:07,009 --> 01:03:08,289
Maybe he did out of fear!

976
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:12,449
Brother, that girl looks hideous.

977
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:13,914
I think he did it
out of hatred!

978
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:19,439
I think she rejected his proposal
and he is trying to seek revenge.

979
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:24,052
Brother, you have an eye on that
girl, ever since she came here.

980
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:26,539
One fine day, when she realizes
your weakness, she'll kill you.

981
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:28,019
Then, she'll be the next drug Lord.

982
01:03:28,379 --> 01:03:31,714
Probably he dislikes working
for her and did this to avoid it.

983
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:34,539
Enough!

984
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:40,109
Everything you said made sense.

985
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:41,848
But, you made a mistake
with pointing fingers.

986
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,357
You are the one, right?

987
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:03,155
This is nothing unusual.
It's quite common here.

988
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:04,688
You must learn to adapt to it.

989
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,684
You shouldn't keep
thinking about it.

990
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,075
Focus your attention on
delivering the packages.

991
01:04:10,589 --> 01:04:13,553
Men may come, men may go!

992
01:04:14,573 --> 01:04:17,482
Only honestly and loyalty will
help you survive here.

993
01:04:18,009 --> 01:04:19,622
Do you follow? Go!

994
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:20,836
Don't be scared! Get going!

995
01:04:21,689 --> 01:04:23,079
Hey Shani!

996
01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:24,837
Clear the body!

997
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:26,769
Wipe this place clean

998
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:28,739
and dunk him in acid.

999
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:30,409
Sir!

1000
01:04:33,819 --> 01:04:35,977
I have my own doubts, sir.

1001
01:04:37,649 --> 01:04:40,157
Maybe, like he mentioned

1002
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:42,489
what if this
guy had done it?

1003
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,635
Shoot him down too!

1004
01:04:44,929 --> 01:04:46,130
Only then I'll leave!

1005
01:04:51,439 --> 01:04:52,875
My judgment never goes wrong.

1006
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:54,039
It's always right!

1007
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:55,351
I'm sure he must have done it.

1008
01:04:55,489 --> 01:04:58,269
No, sir.
We haven't seen it with our eyes.

1009
01:04:58,819 --> 01:05:01,020
You can't be sure of your guess!

1010
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,609
No problem, sir.

1011
01:05:02,759 --> 01:05:03,939
I'll wait here.

1012
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:06,169
You take rest and
then shoot him down.

1013
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:07,209
Okay?

1014
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,039
Oh!

1015
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:11,489
Don't believe her, Brother.
She is misleading you.

1016
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:13,309
Brother, she can't be trusted.

1017
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,629
Please don't trust her, Brother.
I didn't do it, Brother.

1018
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:17,659
I am truly innocent, Brother.
I didn't do it.

1019
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:20,561
Please trust me, Brother.
- I know you didn't do it, Buddy.

1020
01:05:20,979 --> 01:05:24,439
But, it's very difficult to find
a girl like her in our field.

1021
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:32,049
No, sir. I'll leave only after
you shoot him down.

1022
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:34,259
Sir!

1023
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:38,079
Brother, I didn't do it.
I'm innocent.

1024
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:39,769
Brother! Brother!
- Pardon me, dear.

1025
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,129
Brother, I swear I didn't do it.

1026
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:42,409
Sir!

1027
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:43,629
You don't want me to do it?

1028
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:47,699
No, sir. I am feeling scared
to see it. - Brother!

1029
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,389
You shoot him down,
after I walk away from here.

1030
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:53,939
I prefer hearing the gunshot
over seeing this.

1031
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:54,840
Oh!

1032
01:06:18,189 --> 01:06:20,714
Give the bag to me.
- No need, Mom. I'll take it.

1033
01:06:20,794 --> 01:06:21,606
Give it to me!

1034
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:26,819
What tablet is this?
- That makes me nauseous.

1035
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,509
Don't fret about it. Just
one more month!

1036
01:06:28,589 --> 01:06:30,359
Why? Won't I pull beyond that?

1037
01:06:30,439 --> 01:06:32,323
If you keep talking like this,
I am going to strangle you to death.

1038
01:06:32,403 --> 01:06:33,305
Fine!

1039
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:38,736
Who is he?

1040
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:46,486
How dare you get my boys
killed to save your mother?

1041
01:06:46,779 --> 01:06:48,379
What?
- Sir! Sir!

1042
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:49,819
Mom has no
connections with it.

1043
01:06:49,899 --> 01:06:51,379
Who gave you this courage?
- Kokila!

1044
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:53,476
Sir! Sir, please spare my mother.

1045
01:06:53,979 --> 01:06:55,559
You are doing all this
to save her life!

1046
01:07:24,727 --> 01:07:26,614
Why do you refuse work
all of a sudden?

1047
01:07:27,857 --> 01:07:30,360
I don't think I can do
this anymore, sir.

1048
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,005
I feel scared.
I'll definitely get caught.

1049
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,402
Pay me for whatever
I have done until now.

1050
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,117
I'll leave, sir.

1051
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:40,845
Give me 'Appalam'!

1052
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:53,360
Sorry, Brother!

1053
01:07:55,006 --> 01:07:57,214
Since you have hurt your neck

1054
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,042
I thought I can help
you with this.

1055
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:05,350
Fine!

1056
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:07,331
Meet me at 6 PM tomorrow.

1057
01:08:07,885 --> 01:08:08,921
I'll arrange for the money!

1058
01:08:16,335 --> 01:08:18,111
I'll make necessary
arrangements, Brother.

1059
01:08:21,155 --> 01:08:23,795
'Save me!'

1060
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,169
There are only two ways
to exit from this field.

1061
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,866
Either you get caught by Police
or get killed by us.

1062
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:43,549
Sir!

1063
01:08:43,856 --> 01:08:45,431
But, neither of the
two will happen to you.

1064
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:48,747
I am there to help you plan
a clean exit from this.

1065
01:08:49,155 --> 01:08:49,998
Do you follow?

1066
01:08:50,978 --> 01:08:52,101
Thanks a lot, sir.

1067
01:08:52,435 --> 01:08:54,288
Though, I am tough and
stern with others

1068
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:56,991
when it comes to you, I wish
to be gentle and nice.

1069
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:59,826
There's a brown bag inside
the cupboard in that room.

1070
01:09:00,155 --> 01:09:02,685
I have left your money there.
Take it and go!

1071
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:32,553
If you stay calm for
the next one hour

1072
01:09:32,805 --> 01:09:35,403
rest of your life
will be peaceful!

1073
01:09:36,545 --> 01:09:40,402
Right since the very first day,
I have feelings for you.

1074
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:44,149
But, I am sharing it
only now.

1075
01:09:45,705 --> 01:09:47,797
I don't have the stamina
to rape you!

1076
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,268
My spinal cord is
completely damaged!

1077
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:53,490
So, please cooperate with me.

1078
01:09:54,405 --> 01:09:57,215
Switch on the AC with that
remote and lie down!

1079
01:10:19,905 --> 01:10:21,392
Auto.

1080
01:10:33,865 --> 01:10:40,901
'The number your calling is either
switched off or not reachable.'

1081
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,295
Madam, here is the change.

1082
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:53,845
Mom, leave everything
and just come with me.

1083
01:10:53,925 --> 01:10:56,925
There's a small problem. I'll explain
on the way. Hurry up!

1084
01:11:07,335 --> 01:11:09,395
You heard your sister!
Leave immediately!

1085
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:12,613
Take an auto to the bus stand
and enjoy a vacation at ‘Ooty’!

1086
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,223
And we'll go celebrate your
escape with 'Kulfi' party!

1087
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:18,029
What did you do to Mohan?

1088
01:11:18,965 --> 01:11:20,056
He has become like
a lifeless doll!

1089
01:11:20,795 --> 01:11:22,853
Sir, I didn't do anything.

1090
01:11:23,415 --> 01:11:25,030
I just pushed him off.

1091
01:11:26,095 --> 01:11:28,815
He fell against
the cupboard

1092
01:11:28,895 --> 01:11:31,265
His neck was already broken!
Yet, you twisted it!

1093
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:34,093
Don't act innocent here.
- Babu!

1094
01:11:34,295 --> 01:11:36,902
Don't spare her!
- Get lost!

1095
01:11:38,245 --> 01:11:40,658
Are you even aware of Mohan's
power and influence?

1096
01:11:43,035 --> 01:11:45,195
If something happens to him, a bomb
will be launched from Bombay!

1097
01:11:45,275 --> 01:11:47,734
Hey!
- And here it is!

1098
01:11:51,435 --> 01:11:53,945
Yes, Bhai. I am with her.

1099
01:11:54,445 --> 01:11:57,263
You can talk to her.
Here! Speak up!

1100
01:12:06,318 --> 01:12:09,355
Hello!
- Hi, Kokila. How are you?

1101
01:12:09,695 --> 01:12:11,074
Sir.. Sir..

1102
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:13,527
Boys told me that Mohan has
become like a wooden puppet now.

1103
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:15,529
'But, I don't miss Mohan!'

1104
01:12:15,825 --> 01:12:19,039
'When will I miss him?
Only when my work gets stalled.'

1105
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:20,755
'Only when I miss Mohan'

1106
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:23,455
'I would want to harm the person,
who attacked Mohan.'

1107
01:12:23,945 --> 01:12:26,915
Sir, I didn't do anything on purpose.

1108
01:12:26,995 --> 01:12:28,190
'We can discuss that later.'

1109
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:30,405
'How are you going to ensure
that I don't miss Mohan?'

1110
01:12:33,076 --> 01:12:36,142
I agree to do whatever

1111
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:38,358
Mohan was doing for you, sir!

1112
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:42,695
But, will you let me go after
I complete the task?

1113
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:45,060
'First, we'll have to
clear the stock with Mohan!'

1114
01:12:45,255 --> 01:12:46,768
'We can discuss about you later!'

1115
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:50,178
Sir! Sir, how many Kilos
do I have to clear?

1116
01:12:50,915 --> 01:12:51,876
'Hundred Kilos!'

1117
01:12:52,605 --> 01:12:53,503
Sir?

1118
01:12:55,435 --> 01:12:57,519
How do I manage 100 Kilos, sir?

1119
01:12:57,685 --> 01:13:00,773
'Mohan was handling it.
But, you broke his neck.'

1120
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:10,584
Okay, sir.

1121
01:13:11,351 --> 01:13:12,125
I'll do it.

1122
01:13:20,365 --> 01:13:22,008
I have told her
a number of times

1123
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:24,090
that she does not
have to save me.

1124
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:30,240
I am sure she was trying to do it
and landed in trouble.

1125
01:13:32,745 --> 01:13:35,116
We'll have to help her
come out of the mess.

1126
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:39,821
We should do it, before I die.

1127
01:14:04,175 --> 01:14:08,151
I am sure you are wondering
how to open the matter to us.

1128
01:14:08,672 --> 01:14:12,386
But, I am very confident that you
have done something wrong.

1129
01:14:12,735 --> 01:14:15,221
I also know you are
doing it for us. Nope!

1130
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:17,827
I know you are doing it for me.

1131
01:14:18,635 --> 01:14:22,294
What is this, dear?
It is not just your problem anymore.

1132
01:14:22,845 --> 01:14:24,008
We are a family!

1133
01:14:25,785 --> 01:14:28,883
Look! I don't care about
what you have done so far.

1134
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:33,275
Henceforth, we'll be together
in anything we do.

1135
01:14:52,985 --> 01:14:54,102
Sorry, Dad!

1136
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:56,999
I am not going to
ask you anything.

1137
01:14:58,045 --> 01:14:59,920
If I did, you would reply saying you
did this to save your mother.

1138
01:15:00,443 --> 01:15:02,900
If I asked, will you do anything
to save your mother

1139
01:15:03,154 --> 01:15:05,953
you are going to say,
I should have done it.

1140
01:15:08,335 --> 01:15:11,253
Three of you very well know,
I am unfit for it.

1141
01:15:13,795 --> 01:15:15,494
So, you do as you please.

1142
01:15:16,075 --> 01:15:18,059
I'll do as you say!

1143
01:15:31,015 --> 01:15:33,935
Madam, is this house No.4?

1144
01:15:34,475 --> 01:15:36,719
Yes it is. What do you want?

1145
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,809
I have brought a new cupboard.
Where do I unload it?

1146
01:15:43,675 --> 01:15:46,745
We didn't order for any cupboard.
Check in the neighborhood.

1147
01:15:47,785 --> 01:15:51,385
Brother, I ordered for it.
Unload it here!

1148
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:54,357
Fine! Bring it here, Boys!
- Give a hand!

1149
01:15:58,155 --> 01:15:59,625
Lift it up! Hold the bottom.

1150
01:16:04,995 --> 01:16:06,525
Go forward!

1151
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:08,149
Careful!

1152
01:16:10,425 --> 01:16:12,116
Have been waiting for the
delivery of this cupboard?

1153
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:14,762
Do you think we are in the position
to buy a new cupboard now?

1154
01:16:15,865 --> 01:16:17,317
The house is a wreck!

1155
01:16:17,971 --> 01:16:20,032
Yet, you guys are celebrating!

1156
01:16:21,505 --> 01:16:22,284
Hey!

1157
01:16:28,475 --> 01:16:30,713
What? Did you forget what
happened last night

1158
01:16:31,055 --> 01:16:32,765
after seeing the new cupboard?

1159
01:16:32,845 --> 01:16:34,425
Don't you feel ashamed?

1160
01:16:38,205 --> 01:16:39,441
Shut up and turn around!

1161
01:16:44,915 --> 01:16:46,161
What is this, dear?

1162
01:16:47,295 --> 01:16:50,215
This is the package we
have to deliver, Dad.

1163
01:16:55,005 --> 01:16:56,995
'Praise Lord Muruga!'

1164
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,915
'Praise Lord Muruga!'

1165
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:02,345
Lord Muruga, give us the strength

1166
01:17:02,425 --> 01:17:03,815
to deliver the package safely!
Please grace us with your blessings.

1167
01:17:03,895 --> 01:17:06,435
By God's grace,
nothing will happen to us, dear.

1168
01:17:06,515 --> 01:17:08,140
We are doing smuggling for
a good reason.

1169
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,935
God will be with us.

1170
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,716
We can walk with
our heads held high!

1171
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:13,505
Lord Muruga

1172
01:17:14,215 --> 01:17:17,795
please hide us from cops
with your spear!

1173
01:17:17,995 --> 01:17:18,811
Mom!

1174
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:22,549
Do you guys remember
my instructions to you?

1175
01:17:23,209 --> 01:17:26,484
Don't let your face show
that you are smuggling drugs.

1176
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:30,919
We must look very
innocent to others.

1177
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:35,385
Please don't be scared. Most
importantly, stay calm at all times.

1178
01:17:35,465 --> 01:17:39,596
Darling, I'm looking for my daughter
Kokila. Where is she?

1179
01:17:40,232 --> 01:17:42,215
Dad, we don't have a choice.

1180
01:17:42,295 --> 01:17:44,088
Don't bother answering him, dear!

1181
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,159
Attend the call!

1182
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,494
Hello!
- 'Kokila!'

1183
01:17:50,825 --> 01:17:51,474
Tell me, sir!

1184
01:17:51,554 --> 01:17:53,128
'I have sent a white van,
like you had asked.'

1185
01:17:53,255 --> 01:17:55,925
'No.3658! Driver will leave.
You'll have to drive on your own.'

1186
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:58,855
Done, sir!
- 'Begin your drama and call out'

1187
01:17:58,935 --> 01:18:00,525
'van will arrive at your spot.'
- Okay, sir!

1188
01:18:00,605 --> 01:18:02,385
We'll leave in five minutes.
- Hurry up!

1189
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:05,240
Mom, everything is in your hands now.

1190
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,399
Are you sure you can do it?
Do you want to try once?

1191
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:16,330
It's perfect, Mom!

1192
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:19,996
I am just going to drive.
Should I perform too?

1193
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,594
God knows how we'll have
the strength to pull through!

1194
01:18:27,117 --> 01:18:29,452
Mom, are you ready?
Shall we leave?

1195
01:18:29,532 --> 01:18:30,510
Yes! Yes!

1196
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:42,815
Brother! Help!
- Please help! Can someone come?

1197
01:18:42,895 --> 01:18:44,535
Kokila shouting!
- Help! Help!

1198
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:47,065
Mom is unwell. We have to take
her to the hospital. - Start the van!

1199
01:18:47,145 --> 01:18:48,975
She is calling! Start the van!
- Please help!

1200
01:18:49,055 --> 01:18:50,905
Come fast!
- My mom is unwell!

1201
01:18:52,235 --> 01:18:54,025
Please help us, Brother.

1202
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:59,143
Who dashed against my van?
Wait till I get out!

1203
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:08,156
Gosh, it's a new van!

1204
01:19:10,025 --> 01:19:12,365
Who asked you to come here?
- I am here to help!

1205
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:14,095
Do you run an ambulance
service or what?

1206
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,684
Look at you!
You look like an ‘Orangutan!’

1207
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:19,075
You also look like a Chimpanzee!

1208
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:20,565
How dare you speak the truth?
- Hey!

1209
01:19:20,645 --> 01:19:22,297
Hey Little Anjali, I'll slap
you and send you back to school!

1210
01:19:22,377 --> 01:19:23,083
How dare you!

1211
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,305
Start the car!
- Sit down!

1212
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:25,455
I'll slap you!
- Murthy!

1213
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:27,335
Start the van!
Get out of here! Go!

1214
01:19:27,415 --> 01:19:28,505
Go! Get lost!

1215
01:19:29,727 --> 01:19:32,915
Go back! Get going!

1216
01:19:32,995 --> 01:19:34,815
Who are you to help this family?

1217
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,587
Hey Kokila, go bring your mother.

1218
01:19:37,095 --> 01:19:40,365
No! I'll take that White van!

1219
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:43,149
Which is more important?
White van or your mom's health?

1220
01:19:43,805 --> 01:19:45,084
No, it's fine!

1221
01:19:45,164 --> 01:19:47,025
You were calling out
for help a few seconds ago!

1222
01:19:47,105 --> 01:19:48,864
Don't waste your time
choosing the vehicle! Look!

1223
01:19:49,055 --> 01:19:51,475
White van is no good!
Green is a good omen!

1224
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:53,124
Come, let's go. Listen to me!

1225
01:19:54,005 --> 01:19:56,135
What are you still looking at?
- You fat head!

1226
01:19:56,195 --> 01:19:58,245
Haven't you left yet?
- Sir! Sir! We'll go with you!

1227
01:19:58,955 --> 01:20:00,555
I'll break your head.
- We'll go in the green van, sir!

1228
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:02,465
Now, you realize! Go bring my
future mother-in-law. - Sister!

1229
01:20:02,545 --> 01:20:03,965
Come with me!
- Go get ready!

1230
01:20:04,045 --> 01:20:05,215
How do we manage?
- Stop laughing. Come here!

1231
01:20:05,295 --> 01:20:06,805
Give me a hand, you jokers!

1232
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,585
How will they carry
if you lie down like this?

1233
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:09,945
Dad, come here.
- How should I lay down!

1234
01:20:10,025 --> 01:20:11,435
Head this side!
- Lie down!

1235
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,435
Hurry up! Lie down!

1236
01:20:13,515 --> 01:20:16,625
Make it fast!
Come on, Boys! Mother-in-law!

1237
01:20:16,705 --> 01:20:19,345
Look likes she just lay down!
Don't worry, Mother-in-law!

1238
01:20:19,425 --> 01:20:22,562
Hey, hold her legs.
- No! Carry her with the table.

1239
01:20:23,005 --> 01:20:23,876
Why do we need the table?

1240
01:20:23,956 --> 01:20:25,765
Doctor asked me to
bring her with the table.

1241
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,785
Who is this Doctor
who has no table?

1242
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,695
Mom needs help!
- Oh yes! Hold on!

1243
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:30,755
Lift her up like
you lift a sack!

1244
01:20:30,835 --> 01:20:32,915
Sure done! Careful, guys!
- One, two, three.

1245
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,519
Dude, she is really heavy!
- It's all bone weight!

1246
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:39,685
Don't worry, Mother-in-law!
Don't worry!

1247
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:41,495
Don't shake!
Hurry up! Come fast!

1248
01:20:41,575 --> 01:20:44,775
Come here! Brother.
- Careful, Buddy!

1249
01:20:45,365 --> 01:20:48,585
Push this side!

1250
01:20:49,355 --> 01:20:52,165
Done!
- Give me a hand!

1251
01:20:52,775 --> 01:20:54,255
Hey, both of you
go peel coconuts!

1252
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:56,035
'Hey, make sure they
do it properly.'

1253
01:20:56,115 --> 01:20:57,065
Get in!
- Sir!

1254
01:20:57,145 --> 01:21:00,315
Let my dad drive the van!

1255
01:21:01,715 --> 01:21:02,995
Can you?

1256
01:21:03,595 --> 01:21:05,273
Please let dad drive!

1257
01:21:05,935 --> 01:21:09,545
Oh, you want me to stay with you!
Uncle, go hit the accelerator!

1258
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,905
Get in, Kokila! Get in!

1259
01:21:11,985 --> 01:21:14,255
We are not going on a picnic.
Make it fast!

1260
01:21:14,505 --> 01:21:16,685
Sister, hold the bag!
- Mother-in-law, move your feet a bit!

1261
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,785
Uncle, start the van!
'Kokila, if you call out for help'

1262
01:21:19,865 --> 01:21:22,485
'I shall greet thee with a bow!
- Is the spelling right, Kokila?

1263
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:31,445
Sister, nothing will happen to you.
Don't worry!

1264
01:21:31,525 --> 01:21:33,685
Don't be worried
about your daughters!

1265
01:21:33,765 --> 01:21:35,637
Think of me as your own brother.

1266
01:21:35,815 --> 01:21:37,601
I Sekar, the proprietor
of Sekar stores

1267
01:21:37,765 --> 01:21:40,535
promise to save you!

1268
01:21:44,785 --> 01:21:46,545
Poet Thiruvalluvar has quoted

1269
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:49,715
'that no evil will come to people'

1270
01:21:49,795 --> 01:21:51,742
'who are kind and helpful.'

1271
01:21:52,015 --> 01:21:54,445
Your family has done no wrong

1272
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:57,555
and therefore no harm
will come to you. Don't worry, Aunt!

1273
01:21:58,035 --> 01:22:00,545
Babu, kill the girl and her
family as soon as

1274
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:03,285
she delivers the package. We'll
be at risk, if they are alive!

1275
01:22:04,415 --> 01:22:05,513
Sure, Bhai!

1276
01:22:20,095 --> 01:22:21,265
Kokila!

1277
01:22:21,526 --> 01:22:22,455
Police!

1278
01:22:22,715 --> 01:22:24,685
Mom, police is here.

1279
01:22:25,405 --> 01:22:27,975
Oh God!
Hey Kokila, what are you doing?

1280
01:22:28,055 --> 01:22:29,387
Why do you have
to tell her all this?

1281
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:32,134
She is already sick!
I'll deal with the Police!

1282
01:22:34,545 --> 01:22:37,290
Stop the van! Come aside!

1283
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:43,425
'Open the door!'

1284
01:22:46,015 --> 01:22:47,265
Oh, it's this guy!

1285
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:50,815
Dude, she is fighting for life. Don't
try to be a hero now, Ragothaman.

1286
01:22:50,895 --> 01:22:52,402
We have received order
to check all vehicles.

1287
01:22:52,482 --> 01:22:53,489
What are you checking?

1288
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:55,155
Did they ask you
check this innocent family?

1289
01:22:55,235 --> 01:22:56,835
Sir, all you need is money, right?

1290
01:22:56,895 --> 01:22:58,445
Do you want 10's or 100's?

1291
01:22:58,525 --> 01:23:00,074
Do I look like a Policemen
or postman to you?

1292
01:23:00,154 --> 01:23:01,115
Ragothaman!
- Sir! Sir! Sir!

1293
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:03,005
Sir, my mother is unwell.

1294
01:23:03,085 --> 01:23:04,645
We have to rush her to the hospital.
Please, sir!

1295
01:23:04,705 --> 01:23:07,295
Someday, I'll get to book a case!
- Focus on arresting Pedophiles.

1296
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:10,355
Shut it gently, Ragothaman. This is
not your dad Purushothaman's van.

1297
01:23:10,435 --> 01:23:13,115
Uncle, run the van over him. We'll
pay Rs.1,500 as fine and be done.

1298
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:17,005
Only people with heavy pockets
have to fear them. Not us!

1299
01:23:17,305 --> 01:23:20,475
I would have put him in his place.
But, sister's health is priority!

1300
01:23:20,555 --> 01:23:22,965
Uncle, no matter who,
don't stop the van anymore!

1301
01:23:23,045 --> 01:23:24,806
Just run the van over them!
I'll handle the case.

1302
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:26,601
Sekar!

1303
01:23:26,775 --> 01:23:30,135
If Police stop us next time,
please be polite with them.

1304
01:23:30,215 --> 01:23:31,450
Why should we talk Politics?

1305
01:23:31,695 --> 01:23:33,655
If anyone tries to stop
the van anymore

1306
01:23:33,735 --> 01:23:35,445
only my hand will
do the talking!

1307
01:23:36,025 --> 01:23:39,625
Nah! We are carrying certain stuff!
That's why!

1308
01:23:40,025 --> 01:23:42,095
Stuff?
Are you carrying a liquor bottle?

1309
01:23:43,495 --> 01:23:45,725
Something more than that.
- Huh?

1310
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:47,095
Oh, is it beer then?
- Hey!

1311
01:23:47,175 --> 01:23:49,195
Have you never got sloshed before?
- Who? Me?

1312
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:51,835
I am king of getting sloshed!
Close your ears and turn around.

1313
01:23:51,915 --> 01:23:53,555
You are too young to hear all this!
- Yeah right!

1314
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:56,290
Are you carrying Scotch?

1315
01:23:56,525 --> 01:23:59,195
Mom, please get up!
- Don't disturb the patient.

1316
01:23:59,275 --> 01:24:00,545
Don't wake her up.
- Nah! Let me sit for some time.

1317
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:02,685
My back is aching from lying down!
- Suddenly, she seems to be normal.

1318
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:04,525
Ouch!

1319
01:24:17,115 --> 01:24:18,407
What is this?

1320
01:24:19,725 --> 01:24:20,903
Are these 'Rangoli' powder, Kokila?

1321
01:24:21,205 --> 01:24:22,543
It is Cocaine, you fool!

1322
01:24:22,695 --> 01:24:24,864
Cocoa?
Is it the powder that is used

1323
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:26,345
to make chocolates?
- My Foot!

1324
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,435
Hey!
- Haven't you seen foreigners drag it?

1325
01:24:28,515 --> 01:24:30,145
We are smuggling the

1326
01:24:30,225 --> 01:24:32,715
top-most drug in the world.
It is worth Rs. 3 Billion.

1327
01:24:32,795 --> 01:24:34,645
It's been transported from
Columbia to Africa

1328
01:24:34,725 --> 01:24:36,445
from Africa to Afghanistan,
from Afghanistan to Bombay.

1329
01:24:36,525 --> 01:24:37,536
From Bombay it was
brought to Gummudipundi

1330
01:24:37,616 --> 01:24:38,736
and now we are
taking it to Redhills!

1331
01:24:39,065 --> 01:24:41,858
If we get caught, we'll have
to serve 10 years in Jail.

1332
01:24:42,115 --> 01:24:43,610
While we are carrying out
such a crucial task

1333
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:46,365
you are wasting our time
cracking stupid jokes.

1334
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:47,725
Did you just call me stupid?

1335
01:24:52,465 --> 01:24:55,239
Yes, Sekar.
We are smuggling drugs.

1336
01:24:58,525 --> 01:24:59,914
Is it similar to weed?

1337
01:25:00,725 --> 01:25:03,775
Not really! Let me explain!

1338
01:25:03,855 --> 01:25:07,165
Yeah, if one gram of
weed is worth Rs.5

1339
01:25:07,245 --> 01:25:09,525
this will cost you Rs. 5,000.

1340
01:25:11,075 --> 01:25:12,475
This one?

1341
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,478
If one is caught with weed,
he has to serve 7 years in jail!

1342
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:20,335
7 plus the amount here.. I guess
I'll serve lifetime imprisonment.

1343
01:25:20,935 --> 01:25:22,874
I am going to die in jail.

1344
01:25:23,605 --> 01:25:25,115
Police, dear!

1345
01:25:25,195 --> 01:25:27,015
I guess this is why her
dad wanted to drive!

1346
01:25:34,515 --> 01:25:37,901
What a commitment in acting!

1347
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:41,353
I hope it is not Ragothaman!

1348
01:25:44,555 --> 01:25:46,908
Sir, looks like an emergency!
Let them go!

1349
01:26:01,925 --> 01:26:02,811
Fine!

1350
01:26:03,365 --> 01:26:05,251
You are doing a family business here.

1351
01:26:05,675 --> 01:26:07,916
I understand you don't
want any interruptions

1352
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:10,423
and want me to leave.

1353
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:13,165
That's all right! I will leave.

1354
01:26:13,245 --> 01:26:15,454
Uncle, please stop the van.
Let me get down.

1355
01:26:15,635 --> 01:26:17,935
They'll shoot you the moment
you set foot on the ground.

1356
01:26:18,305 --> 01:26:20,915
What?
- Do you see a white van behind?

1357
01:26:20,995 --> 01:26:22,513
They are following us.

1358
01:26:24,865 --> 01:26:27,295
Hey, I saw this van near your house.

1359
01:26:27,355 --> 01:26:28,765
We were supposed
to come in that van.

1360
01:26:28,845 --> 01:26:30,831
But, you've made us travel
in this delivery van.

1361
01:26:31,245 --> 01:26:33,405
Hey, stop throwing chilies.
What if it got stuck in my nose?

1362
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:34,829
You brainless monkey!

1363
01:26:35,335 --> 01:26:38,095
Dear I suggest you travel with us.

1364
01:26:38,335 --> 01:26:41,065
Yeah right! You are going on a family
vacation to Shimla for me to join.

1365
01:26:41,145 --> 01:26:43,868
Keep quiet, woman! Thanks to you,
I got into a fight with Ragothaman.

1366
01:26:44,005 --> 01:26:47,334
You are engaged in smuggling
and you expect me to join you.

1367
01:26:47,705 --> 01:26:48,985
Why is he opening the counter now?

1368
01:26:49,065 --> 01:26:50,187
Police!

1369
01:26:52,345 --> 01:26:54,415
Nah! Come lie down.
Then you can start acting.

1370
01:26:54,495 --> 01:26:56,205
Come! Come!
- Jeez, I can't even rest.

1371
01:26:56,285 --> 01:26:58,215
Start acting as a family!

1372
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:01,715
My wife is unwell.
I am taking her to the hospital.

1373
01:27:02,485 --> 01:27:03,675
Fine, leave.

1374
01:27:14,485 --> 01:27:16,452
It is certain that I can't escape now.

1375
01:27:17,255 --> 01:27:18,429
So, let's pick up one more guy.

1376
01:27:19,925 --> 01:27:22,483
You are traveling as a family!

1377
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,222
I feel real lonely.

1378
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:27,045
If we pick up another guy,
he'll give company to me.

1379
01:27:27,105 --> 01:27:28,001
Who is it, sir?

1380
01:27:31,795 --> 01:27:32,712
Aunt!

1381
01:27:34,665 --> 01:27:36,825
Aunt! Aunt, nothing will happen
to you. You'll be fine.

1382
01:27:36,905 --> 01:27:39,165
You have given birth to
an angel, a darling, Aunt.

1383
01:27:39,245 --> 01:27:41,645
If something happens to you, I'll
break the world and tear the sky.

1384
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:45,095
Don't tear my saree, dear. Sit down.
- Sure, Aunt.

1385
01:27:48,023 --> 01:27:50,715
Bro, I was waiting for a chance
to prove my love.

1386
01:27:50,795 --> 01:27:53,245
Thanks for giving me the opportunity.
Here, take a kiss!

1387
01:27:53,325 --> 01:27:55,605
You idiot! Move aside.
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro!

1388
01:27:56,365 --> 01:27:57,745
Bro, I will never forget this favor.

1389
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,385
Hey, if we get caught, this will
be the last memory you'll ever have.

1390
01:28:00,695 --> 01:28:01,986
Keep quiet for some time.

1391
01:28:02,525 --> 01:28:05,007
He kissed me without brushing!
- Am I irritating you, Bro?

1392
01:28:05,835 --> 01:28:08,235
A little too much, Dude.
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro.

1393
01:28:08,315 --> 01:28:09,715
We have to save Shobi's mother!

1394
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:27,374
Shobi's mom..

1395
01:28:27,785 --> 01:28:29,633
Save..
- It is saving Shobi's mom, Bro!

1396
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:33,355
What is this, dude?
- Bro, let's converse on Whatsapp

1397
01:28:33,435 --> 01:28:34,955
till Shobi's mom
recovers from this.

1398
01:28:35,035 --> 01:28:37,265
Dude, I am sitting right next to you.
We can just talk it out.

1399
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:39,495
Does not matter. Discussing on
phone is the new trend. Please, Bro!

1400
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:41,644
You crazy cyber guy!

1401
01:28:42,055 --> 01:28:45,516
You are going to be doomed.
- Shobi! Shobi! Shobi!

1402
01:28:53,937 --> 01:28:55,365
Lord Sai Baba!

1403
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:00,592
Bro, why are looking at me?
Send it to 30 people immediately.

1404
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,745
Only then, we can save Shobi's mom!

1405
01:29:01,825 --> 01:29:04,165
Hey, there are just 20
people on my contact list.

1406
01:29:04,245 --> 01:29:06,385
Where do I find the other ten?
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro.

1407
01:29:06,465 --> 01:29:08,405
I have to save Shobi's mom!
Save Shobi's mom!

1408
01:29:08,485 --> 01:29:12,010
Save Shobi's mom! Save Shobi's
mom! God please! God!

1409
01:29:12,135 --> 01:29:15,057
Sorry, dear! I called him
here to irritate you!

1410
01:29:15,285 --> 01:29:16,921
But, he is torturing me now!

1411
01:29:17,305 --> 01:29:18,254
Shut up!

1412
01:29:18,565 --> 01:29:21,005
Shut up? Did you see that?

1413
01:29:21,245 --> 01:29:22,674
You will have to stay shut
for the rest of your life.

1414
01:29:23,255 --> 01:29:25,545
Do you want to leave or stay with us?

1415
01:29:25,605 --> 01:29:26,975
We have to save Shobi's mom, Bro.
Please, Bro!

1416
01:29:27,055 --> 01:29:28,987
Mom! Mom! Mom!
- He wants to save your mom!

1417
01:29:35,186 --> 01:29:36,939
We'll have to save Shobi's mom, Bro.

1418
01:29:38,485 --> 01:29:41,910
Sorry! Sorry, Bro!
God, please save Shobi's mom!

1419
01:29:46,095 --> 01:29:48,554
Hey Shobi, hold mom! Mom, careful.
- Lord Muruga, save me.

1420
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:52,462
Sorry!

1421
01:29:54,937 --> 01:29:56,625
I didn't spot the speed-breaker!

1422
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,515
You blind owl!

1423
01:29:59,175 --> 01:30:01,822
Even if we manage to escape from
Police, I don't think he'll spare us.

1424
01:30:02,065 --> 01:30:03,834
He is definitely going to dash
the vehicle somewhere!

1425
01:30:04,005 --> 01:30:06,193
Lord Muruga, save us!

1426
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:11,825
Ouch!

1427
01:30:11,905 --> 01:30:13,405
Bro!
- I'll start swearing now!

1428
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:42,424
Who is this Black Panther?

1429
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:48,401
They all look like amateurs.

1430
01:30:48,995 --> 01:30:50,403
Did you transport 100 kilos of
drug with their help?

1431
01:30:50,905 --> 01:30:52,917
Jeez! I have a few staff here

1432
01:30:52,997 --> 01:30:54,585
as big as wild elephant
and wild buffaloes.

1433
01:30:54,665 --> 01:30:58,135
But, they are unfit to do anything.
Show me the God!

1434
01:31:14,252 --> 01:31:16,190
Wow! Wonderful!

1435
01:31:16,445 --> 01:31:18,793
God, thanks for giving me a glimpse
of such shrewd staff.

1436
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:20,555
Brother!

1437
01:31:20,635 --> 01:31:21,646
Come close!
- What is it, dude?

1438
01:31:21,925 --> 01:31:23,635
You are one of a kind!

1439
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:26,746
No one will ever doubt you!
You've got such a face-cut!

1440
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,881
You look like an unclean toilet!

1441
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:33,155
So do you! You look like the old
shattered bucket in the bathroom!

1442
01:31:34,285 --> 01:31:36,121
You are truly innocent
to tease this Alphonse

1443
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:37,365
who has committed over 30 murders.

1444
01:31:38,245 --> 01:31:40,823
This innocence will take
you too great heights.

1445
01:31:41,186 --> 01:31:42,562
Let me explain it!

1446
01:31:45,885 --> 01:31:48,161
When an illiterate draws high salary

1447
01:31:48,395 --> 01:31:50,257
the literates go
green with jealousy!

1448
01:31:50,615 --> 01:31:52,903
Likewise, when I see you all,
I feel extremely jealous.

1449
01:31:53,755 --> 01:31:55,845
Hey buffaloes, bring the package down.
- Okay, sir.

1450
01:32:13,615 --> 01:32:16,179
Mom, I hope your work is done.

1451
01:32:16,515 --> 01:32:17,993
A big salute to your family!

1452
01:32:18,295 --> 01:32:21,145
Please return the vehicle
to me and get going your way!

1453
01:32:21,225 --> 01:32:22,470
Please! Uncle!

1454
01:32:22,705 --> 01:32:23,865
Stop the van! They've to get down.

1455
01:32:23,945 --> 01:32:26,475
Only 10% of the work is done, dear.
- What?

1456
01:32:27,185 --> 01:32:28,755
We have to complete
the remaining 90%.

1457
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:30,065
90% pending?

1458
01:32:30,565 --> 01:32:32,123
Please shower before
you come tomorrow.

1459
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:33,573
What? Should I shower again?

1460
01:32:33,653 --> 01:32:35,225
Yes, Bro. Let's get an
extra pair of clothes too!

1461
01:32:35,568 --> 01:32:37,985
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro!
- Hey, Bhai!

1462
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:39,845
I am paying Rs.2.5 Billion. Why have
you sent packs of salt to me?

1463
01:32:39,925 --> 01:32:42,615
You asked for it.
- I asked for cocaine salt.

1464
01:32:42,695 --> 01:32:44,279
Whereas, you have
sent me Tata salt.

1465
01:32:44,395 --> 01:32:46,435
We can only make
salt candy out of it.

1466
01:32:46,515 --> 01:32:48,425
Alphonse, stop playing
the fool with me.

1467
01:32:48,505 --> 01:32:50,535
By raising your voice, you can't
turn salt into Cocaine.

1468
01:32:50,615 --> 01:32:53,167
So, stop it. I asked you for
100 kilos of cocaine salt.

1469
01:32:53,247 --> 01:32:55,975
You send me 10 Kilos of Cocaine
and 90 Kilos of table salt.

1470
01:32:56,055 --> 01:32:58,795
It is 100 Kilos of pure Cocaine.
- Just because a tortoise is patient

1471
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:01,485
you cannot test its
patience. Likewise

1472
01:33:01,565 --> 01:33:04,045
don't test this Alphonse's
patience. It is dangerous, Bhai!

1473
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,305
How can I be sure that you
haven't interchanged it?

1474
01:33:06,385 --> 01:33:09,305
Alphonse is good at twisting words
and not changing stuff!

1475
01:33:09,385 --> 01:33:10,831
'Let me explain it to you.'

1476
01:33:11,075 --> 01:33:13,402
I can't take a lion to Comedy Club
to make it laugh.

1477
01:33:13,555 --> 01:33:15,855
Likewise, I cannot take you to lion,
to control your laughter.

1478
01:33:15,935 --> 01:33:17,495
If the package has not reached
you, like you told me

1479
01:33:17,575 --> 01:33:18,935
I will make sure it gets delivered
by tomorrow afternoon.

1480
01:33:19,015 --> 01:33:21,617
If the package does not get delivered
tomorrow, you are not a Bhai.

1481
01:33:21,697 --> 01:33:22,423
You are a girl!

1482
01:33:41,845 --> 01:33:44,745
Tell me, Bhai!
- Babu, package missing!

1483
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:45,885
Hey, wait!

1484
01:33:46,615 --> 01:33:47,525
What are you saying, Bhai?

1485
01:33:47,605 --> 01:33:49,125
If I come to know,
you are responsible for it

1486
01:33:49,205 --> 01:33:52,305
I'll kill everyone in your family,
until the last soul!

1487
01:33:52,385 --> 01:33:54,165
Bhai, I didn't do it.

1488
01:33:54,245 --> 01:33:56,195
I don't trust anyone with this

1489
01:33:56,275 --> 01:33:58,275
as the worth of the
package is very high.

1490
01:33:58,355 --> 01:34:00,733
Did you try calling Kokila?
- She is disconnecting my call.

1491
01:34:00,995 --> 01:34:04,195
What are you saying, Bhai?
- In the next one hour

1492
01:34:04,255 --> 01:34:07,655
you have to report the whereabouts
of her and the package. If you fail

1493
01:34:07,735 --> 01:34:10,145
'I will kill you!'

1494
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,695
Hey, where the hell are you?

1495
01:34:16,005 --> 01:34:18,585
How dare you try to fool us?
Where is the package?

1496
01:34:18,785 --> 01:34:21,195
Sir, I will talk only if you
stay calm.

1497
01:34:21,275 --> 01:34:22,744
Otherwise, I'll cut the call.

1498
01:34:30,185 --> 01:34:31,915
Hey, are you threatening me?

1499
01:34:41,805 --> 01:34:42,985
Where is it?
Tell me!

1500
01:34:43,145 --> 01:34:44,605
Sir, I was the one who
interchanged the stock with

1501
01:34:44,665 --> 01:34:46,513
salt and delivered
it to Alphonse.

1502
01:34:47,435 --> 01:34:49,842
I have the balance 90 Kilos with me.

1503
01:34:50,295 --> 01:34:52,045
I am about to ask you
a small favor!

1504
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:53,585
Are you trying to
get me entrapped in this?

1505
01:34:53,895 --> 01:34:56,206
Please hear me out and then talk!

1506
01:34:56,395 --> 01:34:57,355
Go on!

1507
01:34:57,435 --> 01:35:00,155
I know Bhai won't spare us,
even after we finish this task.

1508
01:35:00,235 --> 01:35:01,975
Either he is going to make us do
this again and again

1509
01:35:02,315 --> 01:35:03,531
or he might just kill us!

1510
01:35:03,695 --> 01:35:05,465
'If we continue to do this'

1511
01:35:05,545 --> 01:35:07,585
'we'll definitely be caught
by Police soon.'

1512
01:35:07,665 --> 01:35:10,605
'We've just got a small chance
to escape from this.'

1513
01:35:10,775 --> 01:35:12,105
'Only you can help us with this.'

1514
01:35:12,895 --> 01:35:15,355
I'll deliver the 90 kilos
of stock to you.

1515
01:35:15,435 --> 01:35:16,907
You can trade it
and make money.

1516
01:35:17,185 --> 01:35:20,461
As far as Bhai is concerned, let him
think we ran away with the stock.

1517
01:35:20,685 --> 01:35:23,440
'Please arrange for us
to escape from here.'

1518
01:35:24,265 --> 01:35:26,919
We'll lead the rest of our lives
in a different city.

1519
01:35:27,475 --> 01:35:30,417
I swear, apart from the two
of us, no one knows it.

1520
01:35:30,785 --> 01:35:32,588
Again, are you trying
to get me trapped?

1521
01:35:32,915 --> 01:35:34,372
Did Bhai ask you to check
my commitment?

1522
01:35:34,745 --> 01:35:36,549
I have stock worth Rs. 2.5 Billion.

1523
01:35:37,175 --> 01:35:40,122
Take ten minutes to think
about it and call me back.

1524
01:35:45,455 --> 01:35:49,077
If you can hand over the stock to me,
without Bhai knowing about it

1525
01:35:49,515 --> 01:35:53,215
I will help you and your family
to have a clean exit from this.

1526
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:56,025
The deal is between the two of us!

1527
01:35:56,235 --> 01:36:00,716
Look, I am not doing this
for the stock or money.

1528
01:36:00,935 --> 01:36:03,920
I don't want four
innocent souls to die!

1529
01:36:04,785 --> 01:36:06,993
'All said and done,
I was the one who recruited you!'

1530
01:36:07,445 --> 01:36:08,926
'So, let me save you!'

1531
01:36:09,695 --> 01:36:13,355
'If we go as per my plan, we can
finish the deal without Bhai's notice.'

1532
01:36:13,805 --> 01:36:15,675
Sir, did you hear that?

1533
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:18,809
How can I trust
someone like this

1534
01:36:19,115 --> 01:36:21,431
and transport 100 Kilos?

1535
01:36:22,055 --> 01:36:23,039
So, I had to..

1536
01:36:24,155 --> 01:36:26,936
I've caught her, Bhai. She is with me.
What should I do now?

1537
01:36:27,385 --> 01:36:29,251
'Hand over the phone to her.'

1538
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:36,180
Talk to him!

1539
01:36:38,845 --> 01:36:40,885
Hello, sir!

1540
01:36:40,965 --> 01:36:43,845
'You'll find a room behind you,
go into it.'

1541
01:36:43,925 --> 01:36:45,285
Okay, sir!

1542
01:36:52,835 --> 01:36:55,849
'Turn left, go near
the cupboard.'

1543
01:36:57,555 --> 01:36:58,657
'Open it.'

1544
01:37:05,425 --> 01:37:06,671
'Open the locker!'

1545
01:37:06,985 --> 01:37:08,935
'The pin is 1476.'

1546
01:37:18,525 --> 01:37:19,429
'Take the gun!'

1547
01:37:23,725 --> 01:37:24,604
'Take it!'

1548
01:38:30,055 --> 01:38:32,635
Bhai! Bhai! Bhai!
Please don't.

1549
01:38:32,715 --> 01:38:34,525
Bhai! Bhai, listen to me.

1550
01:38:34,605 --> 01:38:36,915
Shoot him in the mouth, that spelled
our plan to betray this Bhai!

1551
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:38,905
Bhai! Bhai! Bhai!

1552
01:38:38,985 --> 01:38:41,405
- Listen to me, Bhai.
- I can't do this, sir.

1553
01:38:41,485 --> 01:38:44,395
Get this done by someone else, sir.
Please, sir.

1554
01:38:44,475 --> 01:38:46,225
Bhai!
- 'Put me on speaker!'

1555
01:38:46,305 --> 01:38:48,155
Bhai, please don't do it!
Bhai! Bhai!

1556
01:38:48,235 --> 01:38:49,395
I did it by mistake, Bhai.

1557
01:38:49,475 --> 01:38:51,445
Bhai, I will never do this again!

1558
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:53,965
Boy, place the gun in his mouth.

1559
01:38:54,045 --> 01:38:55,495
Bhai, listen to me.

1560
01:38:56,995 --> 01:38:58,658
He struck a deal with you.

1561
01:38:58,915 --> 01:39:00,410
So, he has to die in your hands.

1562
01:39:01,295 --> 01:39:02,465
Shoot him down!

1563
01:39:03,415 --> 01:39:04,545
Shoot!

1564
01:39:05,185 --> 01:39:08,482
If you don't shoot him now,
I'll shoot your entire family down.

1565
01:40:04,615 --> 01:40:06,945
What did you do now?
- I changed the group's name, Bro.

1566
01:40:07,025 --> 01:40:08,715
To what?
- Struggling for Shobi!

1567
01:40:10,165 --> 01:40:11,449
Super!
- Thanks, Bro!

1568
01:40:11,585 --> 01:40:13,275
I don't need this anymore. Take it.

1569
01:40:13,355 --> 01:40:14,577
Keep it with you!
- Anything for Shobi!

1570
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:16,095
Anything for Shobi!

1571
01:40:19,535 --> 01:40:21,851
The package will be delivered in
an hour. Check and let me know.

1572
01:40:22,005 --> 01:40:22,877
Okay, Uncle!

1573
01:40:39,835 --> 01:40:41,165
Hey, stop the van.

1574
01:40:44,355 --> 01:40:46,265
Get away!
- Sir, please sir.

1575
01:40:46,345 --> 01:40:47,547
My mom is unwell, sir.

1576
01:40:47,627 --> 01:40:49,098
We are taking her to the hospital.

1577
01:40:49,178 --> 01:40:50,198
Move aside.

1578
01:40:50,407 --> 01:40:52,417
Every one of them here
looks like a fraud!

1579
01:40:52,961 --> 01:40:54,052
As a Policeman, I can easily identify.
- Look here, sir.

1580
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:55,463
I also have her health reports.

1581
01:40:56,465 --> 01:40:58,131
Sir!

1582
01:40:58,375 --> 01:40:59,365
There's nothing in it, sir.

1583
01:40:59,445 --> 01:41:01,330
Whoa! So much of cocaine.
- Sir!

1584
01:41:06,118 --> 01:41:08,063
You have smuggled drugs.
Don't act innocent now.

1585
01:41:09,287 --> 01:41:10,868
Ask one of our men
to drive the van.

1586
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:13,827
Bhai, Police has seized our stock.

1587
01:41:16,663 --> 01:41:17,438
'Tell me, Bhai!'

1588
01:41:17,518 --> 01:41:19,295
Sir, your department has
seized our stock.

1589
01:41:19,638 --> 01:41:21,467
How do we approach
that Police Officer, sir?

1590
01:41:21,718 --> 01:41:24,633
Bhai, I am unable to stand the
torture of this crazy Inspector.

1591
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:25,997
'Please let go of the stock.'

1592
01:41:26,131 --> 01:41:27,705
Hey, it is close to 90 Kilos.

1593
01:41:27,861 --> 01:41:29,898
Bhai, you cut the call.

1594
01:41:29,978 --> 01:41:31,947
Let me check and get back.

1595
01:41:33,627 --> 01:41:34,919
90 Kilos!

1596
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:39,092
Hey dude! Hey!

1597
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:40,917
Bring two tender coconuts.

1598
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:43,651
Hey, don't open it. Just get it here.

1599
01:41:51,328 --> 01:41:52,280
Thanks, dude!

1600
01:41:53,165 --> 01:41:54,134
Sir, my payment?

1601
01:41:54,335 --> 01:41:55,968
Why should I pay?
I am the Police.

1602
01:41:56,134 --> 01:41:57,261
Which station, sir?

1603
01:41:57,341 --> 01:41:58,265
Police Station!

1604
01:42:03,837 --> 01:42:04,413
Hello!

1605
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:07,412
Bhai, no one from our department
has seized your stock.

1606
01:42:07,565 --> 01:42:09,737
Someone dressed like a cop

1607
01:42:09,817 --> 01:42:11,680
'has taken it away.'
- Hey!

1608
01:42:12,283 --> 01:42:14,768
Apart from Police, who has the audacity
to seize my stock in Tamil Nadu?

1609
01:42:14,929 --> 01:42:16,064
Alphonse!

1610
01:42:16,144 --> 01:42:18,555
You tried to cheat this Alphonse,
by sending me packs of salt.

1611
01:42:18,635 --> 01:42:20,813
See, how I trapped you!

1612
01:42:21,019 --> 01:42:23,941
Billy, let's split the stock between
us after a month.

1613
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:25,669
'We'll have 
Rs. 2.5 Billion as profit.'

1614
01:42:25,749 --> 01:42:28,631
Let Bhai keep worrying about
the stock like a girl!

1615
01:42:28,711 --> 01:42:30,241
What do I do with these six people?

1616
01:42:30,301 --> 01:42:32,472
Why don't you admit them in medical
college and make them doctors?

1617
01:42:32,938 --> 01:42:34,795
Fool, slit their throats and
throw them away!

1618
01:42:35,055 --> 01:42:36,491
Billy, just a minute!

1619
01:42:36,571 --> 01:42:38,705
'Yes, tell me'
- Check the stock completely.

1620
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,114
Last incident was very bad.

1621
01:42:50,382 --> 01:42:51,996
Billy, I hope it is not salt again.

1622
01:42:52,076 --> 01:42:53,774
No!
- Super!

1623
01:42:53,946 --> 01:42:54,807
It's sugar this time.

1624
01:42:54,887 --> 01:42:57,403
Sugar? What do I do with it?
Should I make a sweet?

1625
01:42:57,483 --> 01:42:59,796
Does she think I am running
a provision store

1626
01:43:00,051 --> 01:43:02,071
'to supply salt and sugar?'

1627
01:43:02,393 --> 01:43:04,779
Billy, you know the gentle Alphonse
who tenders plants.

1628
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:07,680
But, there is a wild side to me.

1629
01:43:07,841 --> 01:43:09,457
I don't care what you do.

1630
01:43:09,537 --> 01:43:11,803
In the next five minutes, we'll have
to know where the stock is.

1631
01:43:12,596 --> 01:43:13,550
Idiot!

1632
01:43:19,478 --> 01:43:21,195
Brother, she has packed
sugar in everything.

1633
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:25,637
How do we extract
information from her?

1634
01:43:25,795 --> 01:43:26,930
She will say it now!

1635
01:43:28,047 --> 01:43:30,427
Hey! Are you a rogue?

1636
01:43:30,593 --> 01:43:31,737
Why are you raising
your hands on her?

1637
01:43:36,928 --> 01:43:39,780
Until they confess the truth,
shoot one after another.

1638
01:43:47,117 --> 01:43:48,274
Dear God!

1639
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,180
I knew he would begin with me.

1640
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:52,702
Bro, please.

1641
01:43:53,337 --> 01:43:55,523
Bro, actually I am an outsider.

1642
01:43:55,767 --> 01:43:57,501
Family members are on
the other side.

1643
01:43:57,746 --> 01:44:01,149
If you want her to confess, her dad
is sitting right on the right corner

1644
01:44:01,276 --> 01:44:04,002
start with him.

1645
01:44:04,082 --> 01:44:06,391
Hey, I dare you to shoot me before
you touch anyone in that family.

1646
01:44:06,471 --> 01:44:08,373
I can't act as per your wishes.

1647
01:44:08,453 --> 01:44:09,458
You are not my boss.

1648
01:44:09,538 --> 01:44:10,164
Hey!

1649
01:44:10,224 --> 01:44:11,422
If you are man of valor,
remove our handcuffs.. Hey!

1650
01:44:11,502 --> 01:44:12,956
Ask him to shut up!
- Ignore him, he is mad.

1651
01:44:13,036 --> 01:44:14,290
Hey!
- Turn this side.

1652
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:16,133
Keep quiet. He might shoot us down.
- You!

1653
01:44:16,213 --> 01:44:17,604
You brainless idiot!

1654
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:19,535
Brother, he is innocent.

1655
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:21,493
Please don't harm him.
- Don't do it, Brother.

1656
01:44:21,573 --> 01:44:22,603
Stock is with Chinna Annachi.

1657
01:44:24,075 --> 01:44:27,330
Damari, Devar Street, Patupalli,
Gummudipundi- 601 201.

1658
01:44:28,947 --> 01:44:31,683
Billy, I'll go check the stock
and call you. Please attend.

1659
01:44:31,763 --> 01:44:32,454
Sure!

1660
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:34,341
Are we all set?

1661
01:44:34,421 --> 01:44:34,987
Yes, Brother!

1662
01:44:35,067 --> 01:44:35,951
Start the car!

1663
01:44:44,494 --> 01:44:48,672
Hey, if you are capable of smuggling
100 Kilos with these amateurs

1664
01:44:48,752 --> 01:44:51,018
you are one smart woman!

1665
01:44:51,098 --> 01:44:52,380
You!
- Hey!

1666
01:44:54,512 --> 01:44:56,525
Brother, I am feeling frustrated.

1667
01:44:56,647 --> 01:44:58,440
You can take out your frustration
on the one next.

1668
01:44:59,272 --> 01:45:02,005
If you lay hands on Shobi

1669
01:45:03,908 --> 01:45:08,128
I'll break your bones, cut you to
pieces, grind you and will swallow it.

1670
01:45:08,208 --> 01:45:09,179
Why, dude?

1671
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:10,446
Love, Bro!

1672
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,353
Hey, why do you stare at him?

1673
01:45:15,256 --> 01:45:17,940
I'm in love with the younger one.
If I can get so worked up

1674
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,409
he is in love with the elder one.
Think about it.

1675
01:45:23,959 --> 01:45:25,126
They are mad!

1676
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:29,963
Wait till he gets his
hands on you.

1677
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:34,082
He'll beat the pulp out of
you, dunk you in acid

1678
01:45:34,162 --> 01:45:36,117
skin you alive and will drag
every last ounce of life out of you!

1679
01:45:36,197 --> 01:45:37,362
No, sir. I won't do so.

1680
01:45:40,019 --> 01:45:42,815
Bro, did I even say a word
against you?

1681
01:45:43,009 --> 01:45:44,780
Then, why do you trust this
idiot and hit me?

1682
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:46,046
Did you see that?

1683
01:45:46,295 --> 01:45:48,205
What next, dude?
- I am soft by nature.

1684
01:45:48,454 --> 01:45:49,242
He is rough and tough!

1685
01:45:49,322 --> 01:45:51,787
Not at all, Bro.
I am the innocent one in this group.

1686
01:45:54,889 --> 01:45:57,264
Hey, he is the one talking.
Why are you hitting me?

1687
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,873
Let me get beaten for what I say.
Do you know what I'll do to you?

1688
01:46:00,397 --> 01:46:03,489
I'll cut you to pieces, marinate with
spices, boil you up

1689
01:46:03,569 --> 01:46:05,350
dry you in hot sun and
will finally grind you

1690
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:08,445
to fine powder, mix it with water
and feed the monkey sitting there.

1691
01:46:08,525 --> 01:46:10,288
I will drink the remaining mix
and go to sleep.

1692
01:46:10,368 --> 01:46:12,493
Next morning, I will
just gargle you out

1693
01:46:12,573 --> 01:46:13,748
you scoundrel!
- Simply superb, Bro.

1694
01:46:13,828 --> 01:46:14,932
You've gone to a
different league, Bro!

1695
01:46:15,105 --> 01:46:18,184
Bhai, I'll take care
of everything here.

1696
01:46:18,264 --> 01:46:21,223
Please don't worry. Come here
as soon as you can.

1697
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:23,263
We'll trace your stock together.

1698
01:46:23,753 --> 01:46:25,977
My flight is at 9. I should be
there by 1 PM.

1699
01:46:26,057 --> 01:46:28,004
Until then, please take care.

1700
01:46:28,832 --> 01:46:29,801
Bro!

1701
01:46:30,596 --> 01:46:31,842
He has become tired.

1702
01:46:51,564 --> 01:46:52,837
Mom!

1703
01:46:53,024 --> 01:46:54,290
Mom!

1704
01:46:57,479 --> 01:47:00,122
Sir, mom needs water.

1705
01:47:00,315 --> 01:47:02,827
She needs to take her tablet.
Please give some water, sir.

1706
01:47:04,018 --> 01:47:06,387
Shut up! This isn't a hospital.

1707
01:47:06,631 --> 01:47:09,554
Hey, she is asking for water.
Give her some.

1708
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:14,812
What is this, Brother?
- Remove their handcuffs!

1709
01:47:36,359 --> 01:47:37,514
Give it to me.

1710
01:47:44,713 --> 01:47:45,448
Hey!

1711
01:47:45,528 --> 01:47:46,678
Don't tie her up.

1712
01:47:46,738 --> 01:47:47,567
Move!

1713
01:47:53,042 --> 01:47:54,157
Come with me!

1714
01:47:54,529 --> 01:47:56,458
Sir, why should I?

1715
01:47:57,315 --> 01:47:58,915
Come!
- Sir! Sir! Please let me go.

1716
01:47:58,995 --> 01:47:59,710
Please, sir.
- Don't do this, Brother.

1717
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:01,207
Come with me!
- Hey!

1718
01:48:01,397 --> 01:48:03,619
Why is he calling Kokila's mom?

1719
01:48:03,699 --> 01:48:06,370
Bro, he is calling Kokila!

1720
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:07,708
Kokila!

1721
01:48:07,935 --> 01:48:10,149
Didn't I offer water
immediately when you asked?

1722
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:12,103
Why do you refuse to come,
when I call you? - No, sir!

1723
01:48:12,183 --> 01:48:13,807
Sir! Sir, please.
- Don't harm her, dear.

1724
01:48:14,685 --> 01:48:19,929
Don't harm her. Please let us go.
Please be considerate!

1725
01:48:20,439 --> 01:48:21,996
Don't harm her.

1726
01:48:22,076 --> 01:48:24,071
My daughter is innocent.

1727
01:48:26,385 --> 01:48:27,392
Mom!

1728
01:48:27,773 --> 01:48:29,813
Kokila, don't go.
- Hey!

1729
01:48:29,893 --> 01:48:31,067
Kokila!

1730
01:48:32,053 --> 01:48:34,631
Don't go, Kokila.
- Fine!

1731
01:48:35,296 --> 01:48:37,493
Kokila, don't go, dear.
- Sister!

1732
01:48:37,744 --> 01:48:38,825
Kokila!

1733
01:48:38,905 --> 01:48:40,399
Please stop him.
- Sister!

1734
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:42,163
'She'll be back in ten minutes.'

1735
01:48:42,243 --> 01:48:43,314
Kokila!

1736
01:48:43,394 --> 01:48:45,744
Bro, they are going to
destroy your lover.

1737
01:48:45,824 --> 01:48:48,544
I feel disgusted.
- Doesn't it bother you?

1738
01:48:48,604 --> 01:48:51,114
I am crying.
Can't you see that?

1739
01:48:51,194 --> 01:48:53,034
I can't even see your eyes, Bro!

1740
01:48:53,114 --> 01:48:55,710
How can you? They have punctured
my face completely.

1741
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:13,428
Sir! Sir! Please don't!
Please, sir!

1742
01:49:13,508 --> 01:49:15,471
Let's not do this, sir.
- Hey!

1743
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:22,106
Okay, sir.

1744
01:49:23,504 --> 01:49:24,078
Go on!

1745
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:35,133
Sir! Sir! Please don't!
It's wrong. Please, sir!

1746
01:49:35,213 --> 01:49:37,490
Sir! Sir! Please call for
my parents.

1747
01:49:38,876 --> 01:49:42,398
What if your men killed them
while I am here?

1748
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:47,516
They won't do anything
without my instruction.

1749
01:49:47,696 --> 01:49:51,092
No, sir. I'll feel comfortable
with my parents around.

1750
01:49:51,549 --> 01:49:54,974
Only then, I won't disturb you.

1751
01:49:55,278 --> 01:49:56,897
Won't you feel awkward
with them around?

1752
01:49:58,330 --> 01:49:59,430
No, sir.

1753
01:49:59,983 --> 01:50:02,315
I'll feel better, if they are around.

1754
01:50:03,131 --> 01:50:05,698
I haven't done it
in parents' presence.

1755
01:50:06,114 --> 01:50:07,814
I am just obliging your request.

1756
01:50:12,977 --> 01:50:15,297
Dugga, bring them here.

1757
01:50:16,056 --> 01:50:17,546
Hey, come fast.

1758
01:50:18,001 --> 01:50:18,789
Don't push me, Bro.

1759
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:19,917
Come!

1760
01:50:22,636 --> 01:50:23,847
Hey, come fast!

1761
01:50:23,927 --> 01:50:25,784
We are trying our best.
- Dugga!

1762
01:50:25,998 --> 01:50:27,209
Don't bring those two!

1763
01:50:27,289 --> 01:50:28,766
Untie these three
and send them here.

1764
01:50:28,846 --> 01:50:30,737
Hey, three of you go there.

1765
01:50:34,398 --> 01:50:35,744
Kokila!
- Hey!

1766
01:51:00,381 --> 01:51:01,854
Dear God!

1767
01:51:03,294 --> 01:51:04,843
This is new to me.

1768
01:51:06,034 --> 01:51:07,621
But, it's fine. Come!

1769
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:13,500
Sir! Sir! Sir!
Please don't, sir.

1770
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:16,163
Sir! Sir! Sir! Listen to me.
Let me go!

1771
01:51:16,243 --> 01:51:18,419
I feel disgusted, sir.
My dad is here.

1772
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,301
You turn around.

1773
01:51:22,064 --> 01:51:23,391
Hey, turn around.

1774
01:51:29,577 --> 01:51:33,819
Sir! Sir! Please don't.

1775
01:51:35,866 --> 01:51:37,935
Sir, please!

1776
01:51:40,109 --> 01:51:42,122
Dear God!
Dad!

1777
01:51:42,316 --> 01:51:44,482
Hey, what are you doing
to my daughter?

1778
01:51:44,952 --> 01:51:48,016
As long as I am alive,
you cannot harm her.

1779
01:51:50,197 --> 01:51:51,945
You! You!

1780
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:57,220
Give me a hand!
Do you think you are a hero?

1781
01:52:00,203 --> 01:52:03,026
Sir! Sir! Please, sir.
- 'Gosh!'

1782
01:52:03,106 --> 01:52:04,202
Hey!

1783
01:52:04,282 --> 01:52:07,378
Spare my daughter.
Kokila, run away. Go!

1784
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:10,498
Go! Shobi, Go!
- Kokila, run away!

1785
01:52:10,578 --> 01:52:14,041
Go, Shobi!
- Shobi, both of you run away.

1786
01:52:14,121 --> 01:52:15,597
Please let us go, sir.
- Runaway!

1787
01:52:15,677 --> 01:52:16,456
Go away, dear.

1788
01:52:16,536 --> 01:52:18,447
Anyhow, I am going
to die in two months.

1789
01:52:18,527 --> 01:52:20,557
Out of grief, I am sure your dad
will die subsequently.

1790
01:52:20,637 --> 01:52:22,446
Please don't think about us. Shobi!

1791
01:52:22,526 --> 01:52:23,858
Just leave!

1792
01:52:23,938 --> 01:52:26,291
Run away! Please spare us, sir.
- Go!

1793
01:52:26,423 --> 01:52:28,265
Please, sir.
- Where are you going?

1794
01:52:28,673 --> 01:52:31,171
They may ask you to leave.
Don't you have sense?

1795
01:52:32,016 --> 01:52:34,194
You cannot escape from my boys!
So, come.

1796
01:52:34,254 --> 01:52:35,931
Lay down! Please, sir.

1797
01:52:36,011 --> 01:52:38,086
We don't have a choice.

1798
01:52:40,525 --> 01:52:42,741
We'll have to do this.

1799
01:52:44,296 --> 01:52:47,855
I am sure in the next
one hour, he'll kill us.

1800
01:52:48,592 --> 01:52:50,670
This is our last chance.

1801
01:52:51,837 --> 01:52:53,283
Let's try it out!

1802
01:52:54,998 --> 01:52:57,305
Fool, are you going to
sleep with him?

1803
01:52:58,088 --> 01:53:00,352
No, Mom.
I am going to kill him.

1804
01:53:03,203 --> 01:53:05,544
Pick up any tool you find.

1805
01:53:08,328 --> 01:53:10,083
Sir, she is just
blabbering out of fear.

1806
01:53:10,163 --> 01:53:11,293
Please don't mistake her.

1807
01:53:11,353 --> 01:53:13,648
Hey fool, take a good look at sir.

1808
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,751
He is six feet tall.
How can we kill him?

1809
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:17,008
We can't kill you, sir!

1810
01:53:17,088 --> 01:53:20,639
She doesn't even realize that. Very
innocent she is. Please let us go, sir.

1811
01:53:21,601 --> 01:53:23,217
No, sir. Please spare us.

1812
01:53:23,297 --> 01:53:24,697
We have a lot of trouble
because of her, sir.

1813
01:53:24,777 --> 01:53:26,595
I'll definitely change her, sir.

1814
01:53:26,675 --> 01:53:29,346
Look how she got us trapped
here, sir. I'll take care of her.

1815
01:53:29,426 --> 01:53:30,784
Please forgive us, sir.

1816
01:53:46,877 --> 01:53:50,037
Hey, you asked me to kill him.
What are you waiting for?

1817
01:53:50,117 --> 01:53:51,255
Come along!

1818
01:54:20,765 --> 01:54:21,838
Sister!

1819
01:54:21,991 --> 01:54:23,374
Sister! Sister!
- Shobi!

1820
01:54:23,454 --> 01:54:24,703
Don't cry, Shobi!
- My sister!

1821
01:54:24,783 --> 01:54:26,633
My sister is tired.
- I can't see you cry, Shobi.

1822
01:54:26,713 --> 01:54:28,460
She needs water.
- My heart pains, Shobi.

1823
01:54:28,723 --> 01:54:30,356
My sister is..
- I'll kill all of them, Shobi!

1824
01:54:30,436 --> 01:54:32,149
bleeding!
- I'll take care of you.

1825
01:54:32,229 --> 01:54:34,785
My sister is tired.
- I can't see you cry, Shobi.

1826
01:54:34,937 --> 01:54:36,944
Can you give her some water?
- Don't worry, Shobi. I am here.

1827
01:54:37,024 --> 01:54:38,501
They ruined my lover.
- Don't cry, Shobi.

1828
01:54:38,881 --> 01:54:41,123
They have destroyed 
my love completely! - Bro!

1829
01:54:41,203 --> 01:54:44,292
Shobi is crying, Bro.
- My sister is tired.

1830
01:54:44,583 --> 01:54:45,669
Hey!
- Please bring some water.

1831
01:54:45,749 --> 01:54:47,468
Shobi is asking for water.
- Do you want water?

1832
01:54:47,548 --> 01:54:49,010
Please give her some water.
- I'll send it across.

1833
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:51,716
Bro, Shobi is asking for water.
- Please give her some water.

1834
01:54:51,902 --> 01:54:55,134
Bro! Bro!
At least send some water for her.

1835
01:54:55,214 --> 01:54:56,669
Who is he to
give her water, Bro?

1836
01:54:56,749 --> 01:54:59,207
Bro! Bro, Please!
Sincere love, Bro.

1837
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:01,284
Bro, please show some respect for
love. Let him take the water.

1838
01:55:01,364 --> 01:55:02,626
Bro, please!
- Hold this. Be careful!

1839
01:55:02,706 --> 01:55:04,134
Bro! Bro! Bro!

1840
01:55:04,398 --> 01:55:07,434
Hey, if you lay hands on Kokila,
I'll start swearing your parents.

1841
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:09,940
Hey!
- Sister!

1842
01:55:10,881 --> 01:55:11,877
Billy!

1843
01:55:13,675 --> 01:55:15,481
Sister! Sister!

1844
01:55:15,904 --> 01:55:19,232
Sister is tired.
- Gosh!

1845
01:55:19,312 --> 01:55:23,805
My sister is bleeding.

1846
01:55:23,885 --> 01:55:27,152
She is tired.
She needs a little water.

1847
01:55:27,232 --> 01:55:29,470
My sister is tired.

1848
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:32,298
Bro, her sister is tired again!

1849
01:55:32,878 --> 01:55:35,155
They ruined your love
for the second time.

1850
01:55:35,905 --> 01:55:37,533
I am good at counting! I know!

1851
01:55:37,827 --> 01:55:40,532
He dares to remove his shirt
right in front of me.

1852
01:55:40,612 --> 01:55:43,301
God, please save Kokila!

1853
01:55:46,673 --> 01:55:48,834
Hey Dugga, are you done?

1854
01:55:51,992 --> 01:55:53,047
Yet again?

1855
01:55:53,127 --> 01:55:55,961
Why is she coming
again and again, Bro?

1856
01:55:56,952 --> 01:55:59,412
What's happening there?
Why do you keep asking for water?

1857
01:55:59,492 --> 01:56:01,246
Are you playing some
kind of a game?

1858
01:56:01,401 --> 01:56:03,284
These guys are entering in
the pretext of serving water.

1859
01:56:03,418 --> 01:56:05,233
Hello, Bro! Bro!
- Hey!

1860
01:56:05,518 --> 01:56:09,998
Sister needs water.
- She'll shut the door now. Watch!

1861
01:56:10,561 --> 01:56:14,089
Hey, let me sit inside. Please!

1862
01:56:14,911 --> 01:56:17,419
Sister! Sister!

1863
01:56:17,499 --> 01:56:19,945
God!
- Hey!

1864
01:56:20,025 --> 01:56:21,672
Stay silent. Okay!

1865
01:56:23,453 --> 01:56:24,199
Hey!

1866
01:56:24,588 --> 01:56:26,119
It's fine even if
they shoot me down!

1867
01:56:26,385 --> 01:56:27,270
I am going to go there.

1868
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:28,444
Where are you going, Bro?

1869
01:56:28,932 --> 01:56:30,630
Do you want to see
her in this state?

1870
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:33,658
These guys must be sitting around
her in an undressed state.

1871
01:56:33,824 --> 01:56:35,128
Do you want to go see it?

1872
01:56:35,561 --> 01:56:36,779
Undressed?

1873
01:56:37,631 --> 01:56:41,013
I feel like dying,
when I hear all this.

1874
01:56:41,093 --> 01:56:44,015
Bro, they might have
raped your lover.

1875
01:56:44,095 --> 01:56:46,640
But, not your love.
Your love still remains pure!

1876
01:56:47,025 --> 01:56:48,613
Please prove it, Bro.

1877
01:56:49,922 --> 01:56:50,527
Correct!

1878
01:56:51,591 --> 01:56:54,168
I will! I will prove my love.

1879
01:56:56,121 --> 01:56:58,353
You are the only support
for Kokila, Bro.

1880
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,912
Only you can
give her a life.

1881
01:57:01,673 --> 01:57:03,333
Please think about
your love for her.

1882
01:57:03,593 --> 01:57:06,845
Forget the rest, Bro.

1883
01:57:07,147 --> 01:57:08,556
You are a true gentleman, Bro.

1884
01:57:15,642 --> 01:57:19,012
Kokila, this is a black day
in our love!

1885
01:57:19,365 --> 01:57:21,794
Forget all this!
I will too!

1886
01:57:22,105 --> 01:57:24,516
Let's just think we were
attacked by some street dogs.

1887
01:57:25,301 --> 01:57:28,783
I will never bring this
up again or hurt you!

1888
01:57:29,392 --> 01:57:32,353
I will marry you!
Let's lead a life together.

1889
01:57:32,433 --> 01:57:35,458
I'll make you the owner of my shop.
I swear upon the Goddess of Sky!

1890
01:57:35,784 --> 01:57:38,178
Darling, should we finish him too?

1891
01:57:38,372 --> 01:57:39,659
Mom, don't bother.
- What did you say?

1892
01:57:39,739 --> 01:57:44,518
Bro, they have committed
murder as a family!

1893
01:57:44,598 --> 01:57:45,550
Really?

1894
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:47,694
Yes, Bro!
They have committed murders.

1895
01:57:47,774 --> 01:57:51,573
Their hands are stained with blood.
Your love is pure!

1896
01:57:51,653 --> 01:57:54,776
Your love is great, bro!
She has committed murders for you.

1897
01:58:10,773 --> 01:58:12,492
Sir, that's the van.

1898
01:58:27,757 --> 01:58:31,079
I have solved a lot of cases so far.
But, I have never felt accomplished.

1899
01:58:35,248 --> 01:58:36,988
Now, I have caught your
family red-handed.

1900
01:58:37,259 --> 01:58:39,078
I feel extremely proud and happy!

1901
01:58:39,728 --> 01:58:41,424
I don't think even Military
force could have done it.

1902
01:58:42,201 --> 01:58:44,046
I'll go boasting around!

1903
01:58:45,064 --> 01:58:48,273
Sir, even now, you have not
caught the actual criminals.

1904
01:58:48,446 --> 01:58:50,603
You have just caught
an innocent family!

1905
01:58:50,757 --> 01:58:53,193
Even without us,
the trade will continue.

1906
01:58:53,704 --> 01:58:56,444
You don't have to worry about that.
I've caught you!

1907
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,363
I know how to catch the rest!

1908
01:58:59,364 --> 01:59:02,787
It's very difficult, sir.
I am sure they'll kill you before it

1909
01:59:03,048 --> 01:59:05,390
or get you transferred from here.

1910
01:59:07,487 --> 01:59:11,666
If I help you, we can nab them
before either of this happens.

1911
01:59:12,012 --> 01:59:15,948
If you promise to spare
our family, I'll help you!

1912
01:59:18,633 --> 01:59:22,293
If you let us go, I'll help you
nab the head in Bombay

1913
01:59:22,501 --> 01:59:25,684
and also hand over the
9 kilos of cocaine to you.

1914
01:59:33,079 --> 01:59:36,518
If you do as promised, I'll definitely
let you and your family go scot-free!

1915
01:59:37,916 --> 01:59:40,540
Do you trust my words
or should I give it in writing?

1916
01:59:40,805 --> 01:59:41,769
This will do, sir.

1917
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:46,369
Mukhil!
- Sir!'

1918
01:59:46,449 --> 01:59:47,608
I have sent you an address.

1919
01:59:47,815 --> 01:59:49,587
'Yes, sir.' - You'll find 90 Kilos
of cocaine there.

1920
01:59:49,667 --> 01:59:53,060
Shift it to Karpagambal Mess and
assign an officer to take care of it.

1921
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:54,913
No one should know about it. Okay?

1922
01:59:54,993 --> 01:59:55,943
'Okay, sir.'

1923
02:00:00,005 --> 02:00:01,695
Please come, sir.
For the first time..

1924
02:00:07,247 --> 02:00:08,157
What, Venu?

1925
02:00:08,217 --> 02:00:10,517
Are you ready to take
Police's side at least today?

1926
02:00:18,273 --> 02:00:19,012
Hello!

1927
02:00:19,092 --> 02:00:22,490
I think that girl is
moving out of this town.

1928
02:00:22,645 --> 02:00:23,756
When are you coming?

1929
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:25,529
I'll be there in an hour.

1930
02:00:25,609 --> 02:00:26,935
Please make sure she does not go!

1931
02:00:30,107 --> 02:00:31,103
'Hello!'

1932
02:00:31,183 --> 02:00:34,090
Hello, Sekar.
I need a small favor from you.

1933
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:35,827
'Tell me, Kokila.
What do you want?'

1934
02:00:36,194 --> 02:00:38,297
There's some money at the
place I am going to tell you.

1935
02:00:38,483 --> 02:00:40,483
Please tell them Inspector Guru sent
you. They'll give you the money.

1936
02:00:40,563 --> 02:00:41,638
'Where should I go?'

1937
02:00:41,818 --> 02:00:44,662
Karpagambal Mess.
They'll give you a green color bag.

1938
02:00:44,742 --> 02:00:46,738
Please listen carefully.
It's a green color bag.

1939
02:00:47,021 --> 02:00:48,495
Can you please bring it for me?

1940
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:49,512
'Don't trouble me after this.'

1941
02:00:49,592 --> 02:00:50,342
Sure!

1942
02:01:02,129 --> 02:01:03,083
Hey!

1943
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:06,399
Keep it low!
You are heard outside.

1944
02:01:54,696 --> 02:01:57,742
Don't you want to bid farewell
before you leave the town?

1945
02:01:58,493 --> 02:02:02,041
That's fine! But, you should
tell me where my stock is.

1946
02:02:03,232 --> 02:02:05,851
If you tell me, I'll spare
all of you alive.

1947
02:02:07,518 --> 02:02:09,089
I am sure you are not
going to believe me if I say so.

1948
02:02:09,705 --> 02:02:11,094
But, I promise. I'll let you go!

1949
02:02:11,677 --> 02:02:12,369
Madam!

1950
02:02:13,407 --> 02:02:16,195
We are getting late. Only if we leave
now, we'll reach there by dawn.

1951
02:02:16,458 --> 02:02:17,212
Get out!

1952
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:21,350
Where is the package?

1953
02:02:26,714 --> 02:02:27,434
Gosh!

1954
02:02:42,068 --> 02:02:44,022
Sir, thanks a lot!

1955
02:02:44,299 --> 02:02:45,068
We'll leave now.

1956
02:02:45,378 --> 02:02:46,280
Where are you going?

1957
02:02:46,867 --> 02:02:48,577
You have made a mistake.

1958
02:02:48,657 --> 02:02:50,840
As per law, you must be punished
if you have committed a crime.

1959
02:02:51,056 --> 02:02:52,158
I completely agree with it.

1960
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:55,588
Sir, you said you'd let us go,
if we helped you nab him.

1961
02:02:57,250 --> 02:02:59,415
I was lying!
- Sir, what is this?

1962
02:02:59,495 --> 02:03:00,501
Why do you keep..

1963
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:03,220
Why do you keep going
back on your word?

1964
02:03:04,279 --> 02:03:06,804
Sir! Sir! Please don't do this, sir.

1965
02:03:06,884 --> 02:03:09,350
Sir, please..
- I have caught 90 Kilos of cocaine

1966
02:03:09,430 --> 02:03:10,935
along with the criminals.

1967
02:03:11,191 --> 02:03:12,678
Come as fast as you can!

1968
02:03:12,758 --> 02:03:14,512
Sir! Sir!
- Sir! Sir!

1969
02:03:14,592 --> 02:03:15,654
Sir! Sir! Please, sir!

1970
02:03:15,734 --> 02:03:17,591
Sir, this is unfair!

1971
02:03:17,671 --> 02:03:19,674
Does it look like
we did this for money?

1972
02:03:19,754 --> 02:03:21,984
What did you do it for?
The nation?

1973
02:03:23,044 --> 02:03:25,620
Actually, I should have shot you down.

1974
02:03:26,088 --> 02:03:28,427
But, I am sparing you alive, only
because you helped me nab him.

1975
02:03:29,084 --> 02:03:30,025
Sir!

1976
02:03:30,842 --> 02:03:32,585
I have an idea, sir.
- Tell me, sir.

1977
02:03:32,665 --> 02:03:35,620
My wife and I will admit to the
mistake and surrender.

1978
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:38,285
Please spare my two daughters, sir.

1979
02:03:38,365 --> 02:03:39,763
You want to
take the blame?

1980
02:03:39,928 --> 02:03:41,670
Your wife will die
before we reach the court.

1981
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:43,197
You'll die before the next hearing.

1982
02:03:43,344 --> 02:03:47,267
Only I will have to attend the
hearings then! What a foolish idea.

1983
02:03:48,525 --> 02:03:50,549
Going by the looks, you don't look
anything more than a pancake vendor.

1984
02:03:51,275 --> 02:03:52,544
Yet, you have managed
to smuggle drugs.

1985
02:03:53,195 --> 02:03:56,283
Sir, I had to save my mother.
I didn't know what to do.

1986
02:03:56,534 --> 02:03:58,514
Hence, we committed this mistake.

1987
02:03:58,594 --> 02:04:01,377
A wrong can never set anything right.
It just remains a mistake!

1988
02:04:01,998 --> 02:04:03,637
Sir! Sir, let me explain.

1989
02:04:03,717 --> 02:04:05,035
Give me the records.
Give it to me.

1990
02:04:05,115 --> 02:04:06,889
He might understand if he takes a
look at it. - Calm down, Mom.

1991
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:08,980
Please wait, dear.
- Calm down, Mom.

1992
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:10,301
Let me show it to you, sir.

1993
02:04:10,765 --> 02:04:11,796
I'll explain, sir.

1994
02:04:12,322 --> 02:04:13,512
Take a look at this file, sir.

1995
02:04:14,688 --> 02:04:16,169
Sir, this is my file.

1996
02:04:16,249 --> 02:04:18,134
We need money. Hold on!

1997
02:04:18,214 --> 02:04:20,306
Sir, we'll need about Rs. 1.5 Million
for my treatment.

1998
02:04:20,386 --> 02:04:21,801
She was just trying to save me, sir.
- Okay!

1999
02:04:21,881 --> 02:04:23,946
Hold on, dear.
She is too fond of me, sir.

2000
02:04:24,026 --> 02:04:26,216
Go on!
- She did all this only to save me!

2001
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:31,689
I swear, we'll do nothing
of this sort again, sir.

2002
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:35,203
Please excuse us, sir.
- Mom!

2003
02:04:35,283 --> 02:04:37,084
We'll leave this town and
lead our lives elsewhere, sir.

2004
02:04:37,144 --> 02:04:39,921
She didn't realize the consequences.
Sorry, sir.

2005
02:04:41,014 --> 02:04:41,734
Mom!

2006
02:04:42,385 --> 02:04:45,485
Hey, having done everything,
don't act like an innocent!

2007
02:04:45,648 --> 02:04:46,868
I'll kill you!

2008
02:04:49,373 --> 02:04:52,161
Kokila, you are right, dear.

2009
02:04:53,345 --> 02:04:55,171
We'll have to go your way,
to deal with this guy.

2010
02:04:55,463 --> 02:04:56,459
What did you do?

2011
02:04:58,603 --> 02:04:59,475
Shobi!

2012
02:05:10,073 --> 02:05:13,125
I wanted to relax.
Where are you taking me, dear?

2013
02:05:13,311 --> 02:05:15,311
Who wants to see me
at this hour, dear?

2014
02:05:17,255 --> 02:05:19,752
Honey, what are you doing here?

2015
02:05:20,132 --> 02:05:22,021
You look like a van driver!

2016
02:05:23,142 --> 02:05:24,346
What are you doing here?

2017
02:05:24,426 --> 02:05:26,733
I told you I was going for a massage.

2018
02:05:26,813 --> 02:05:28,269
But, this isn't a massage parlor.

2019
02:05:28,349 --> 02:05:30,753
At a massage parlor, I get massage
only for 1.5 hours.

2020
02:05:30,833 --> 02:05:34,731
But, here they offer me a full night's
massage. Complete relaxation.

2021
02:05:39,687 --> 02:05:41,216
If you don't let us go

2022
02:05:41,296 --> 02:05:44,129
I'll tell the officials that all
five of us were engaged in the trade.

2023
02:05:45,507 --> 02:05:49,178
Then, you'll have to
arrest all five of us.

2024
02:05:50,676 --> 02:05:52,005
Sorry, sir.

2025
02:05:52,952 --> 02:05:53,890
Poor thing, sir.

2026
02:05:54,467 --> 02:05:56,432
We are all innocent!

2027
02:05:58,916 --> 02:06:01,102
Sir, this is Inspector Guru.
- I am Krishna!

2028
02:06:05,504 --> 02:06:06,369
Where is the accused?
Is it these people?

2029
02:06:06,565 --> 02:06:09,740
No, sir. Three people are accused.
Two are outside, one is dead.

2030
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:12,432
What happened?

2031
02:06:12,512 --> 02:06:14,813
Sir, I seized 90 Kilos of
Cocaine from them.

2032
02:06:14,893 --> 02:06:18,064
As a revenge, he held my wife and
her friends as hostage.

2033
02:06:18,144 --> 02:06:19,808
So, I had to shoot out!

2034
02:06:24,049 --> 02:06:25,724
So, you'll do everything
on your own

2035
02:06:25,804 --> 02:06:28,131
and inform us at last.
Am I correct?

2036
02:06:28,211 --> 02:06:29,211
Sorry, sir!

2037
02:06:29,447 --> 02:06:30,484
Where is the substance?

2038
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,381
It's at Karpagambal Mess, sir.

2039
02:06:32,630 --> 02:06:33,700
Check it!

2040
02:06:35,134 --> 02:06:36,933
You may leave.
It's getting late for you!

2041
02:06:37,092 --> 02:06:38,186
Sorry!
- Sure, sir.

2042
02:06:38,684 --> 02:06:40,273
Keep this in your bag, dear.

2043
02:06:41,873 --> 02:06:43,520
I asked you to take these
photo frames.

2044
02:06:43,580 --> 02:06:46,474
Why didn't you take it?
Go do it now!

2045
02:06:49,302 --> 02:06:51,317
Hurry up!
We have to leave.

2046
02:07:00,572 --> 02:07:02,824
Sorry, sir.
I didn't do it on purpose.

2047
02:07:03,203 --> 02:07:06,809
You catch hold of criminals.
I was certain you'll be double smart.

2048
02:07:07,093 --> 02:07:08,636
So, I didn't trust you too!

2049
02:07:58,944 --> 02:08:01,132
Kokila, this bag had more money

2050
02:08:01,212 --> 02:08:02,988
than the one you had mentioned.
Is it okay?

2051
02:08:45,529 --> 02:08:47,259
What did she do? Tell me!

2052
02:08:47,530 --> 02:08:49,054
Answer me!
Open your mouth.

2053
02:08:49,134 --> 02:08:50,622
Sir, one person has already
murdered four people

2054
02:08:50,702 --> 02:08:52,200
and is committing
the fifth murder.

2055
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:54,589
I didn't do it, sir. Trust me!

2056
02:08:54,669 --> 02:08:57,281
He is admitting to the murder, sir.
Can I arrest him?

2057
02:08:58,308 --> 02:09:00,773
Sir! Sir! Sir, I am innocent.
- Come on!

2058
02:09:01,108 --> 02:09:02,502
Come along!
- Just a minute, sir.

2059
02:09:02,582 --> 02:09:04,254
I am going to say something.
Please hear me out.

2060
02:09:04,728 --> 02:09:05,627
What is it?

2061
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:36,927
Dad, he hasn't paid us for the
previous stock either.

2062
02:09:37,007 --> 02:09:38,943
If he is going to continue like this,
it won't be the same anymore.

2063
02:09:39,023 --> 02:09:40,508
Do you hear me?

2064
02:09:40,588 --> 02:09:44,859
Please collect money for this along
with previous dues. Be strict with him.

2065
02:09:44,939 --> 02:09:49,102
If you stand like a doll, we can't
carry on business like this.

2066
02:09:49,807 --> 02:09:51,192
Here, take it.

2067
02:09:55,330 --> 02:09:56,303
Here!

2068
02:09:57,321 --> 02:09:59,259
It isn't enough if you
just buy the stock.

2069
02:09:59,721 --> 02:10:02,100
You must also pay for it.

2070
02:10:02,868 --> 02:10:04,108
After all,
you are selling 'Rangoli' powder.

2071
02:10:04,503 --> 02:10:06,695
Don't act like a business magnet.

2072
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:08,727
How much do I owe you?

2073
02:10:08,908 --> 02:10:10,585
An old balance of Rs. 420!

2074
02:10:11,257 --> 02:10:12,480
Current balance Rs.420!

2075
02:10:12,635 --> 02:10:14,176
So, Rs. 840!

2076
02:10:14,652 --> 02:10:16,115
Cool!

2077
02:10:18,566 --> 02:10:19,593
Here, take the cash.

2078
02:10:20,512 --> 02:10:21,441
Maintain the tray properly.

2079
02:10:21,521 --> 02:10:23,330
Don't act as though this
is some precious object!

2080
02:10:23,863 --> 02:10:25,441
Where is the old tray?

2081
02:10:25,744 --> 02:10:26,927
Here, take it.

2082
02:10:27,625 --> 02:10:29,549
Given a choice, you'd just keep it.

2083
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:32,517
Dear!

2084
02:10:33,377 --> 02:10:34,739
Did you check properly?
Is there Rs. 840?

2085
02:10:34,819 --> 02:10:36,089
Yes, dear! You can count it.

2086
02:10:46,816 --> 02:10:48,113
'Hello, Mom!'
- 'Yeah, tell me.'

2087
02:10:48,193 --> 02:10:49,637
'We are going to the temple
this evening. Do you remember?'

2088
02:10:49,717 --> 02:10:51,454
'Yes, I do.'
- 'Ask Shobi not to go out.'

2089
02:10:51,534 --> 02:10:53,995
'She is at home.'
- 'We'll be there at 5PM.'

2090
02:10:54,075 --> 02:10:55,033
'Do you want something?'

2091
02:10:55,113 --> 02:10:57,357
'One packet of milk and
250gms of Coffee Powder.'

2092
02:10:57,437 --> 02:10:58,503
'Okay, bye!'
