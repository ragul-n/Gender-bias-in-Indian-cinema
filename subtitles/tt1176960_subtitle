1
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,661
This country, our country.
Rising country.

2
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,729
This is country's rising politician.

3
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,628
This is rising talent.

4
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,969
This is rising gangster,
Laxminarayan One.

5
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,048
Who's the king of Mumbai?

6
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,155
He's a Gangster-son.

7
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,124
Gangster-son,
What is it?

8
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,822
Like Star-son.

9
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,095
Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan
Sanjay Dutt, Abhishek Bachchan.

10
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:14,705
You're the Abhishek Bachchan
of gangster community.

11
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,633
Your father Pappu MMS.

12
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,643
He was Amitabh Bachchan
of the gangster community.

13
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,082
Today his Refugee is releasing.

14
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,546
Meaning 1st murder.

15
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,978
I'm here to kill you.
What did I do?

16
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:31,851
You want to keep my boss's
land!

17
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,026
Brother... His Refugee,
Will it be a hit or flop?

18
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,733
Tell her, Who's the king of Mumbai?
Who?

19
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:52,038
Brother... Apparently she's the king
and the king Kong.

20
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,140
Poor Laxminarayan.

21
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,208
Badla Bhai told his mother.

22
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,579
What did he say?
Laxi's mother...

23
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,847
Steel from the gun and
child from the womb.

24
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,526
They never go back.

25
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,755
But only mother knows her pain.
Right?

26
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:16,127
I thought he'll do few murders
in his life.

27
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,794
I thought he'll get settled.

28
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,935
I wanted to you marry the daughter
of Chota Khujli.

29
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,005
But came out useless.

30
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,611
Take your argument at home.

31
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,522
Bhai give me one chance.

32
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:44,023
No one gets two 4s at one ball
and two chances in one life.

33
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,689
Stupid fool like you Laxminarayan
is no one else in the world.

34
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,536
Shoe is chewing me,
then you chew it.

35
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,952
This is Laxminarayan Two,
MBA from Jharkan University.

36
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,615
He has just two rules in life.

37
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,324
Rule no 1, Boss is always right.

38
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,994
Rule no 2, If the boss is wrong
then follow the rule no 1.

39
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,535
Sofa or Chair, Sir?

40
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,374
Chair.

41
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,567
Left or right, Sir?
Left.

42
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,200
Your left or my left, Sir?

43
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,244
But sir I came thought here,
there are two doors...

44
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,013
shall I go through here or there?

45
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,338
Where is he?

46
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,540
Brother, Buy a underwear.
I don't want it.

47
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:41,273
Buy a underwear, It's awesome.
I said, I don't want it.

48
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:44,144
Buy it, once you wear it
you'll become superman.

49
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,015
Wear it and fly, it won't rip off.
Wear it and fight, it won't rip off.

50
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,145
Wear it and climb Kutub Minar,
it won't rip off.

51
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:52,189
Jump off the Kutub Minar...

52
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:54,724
...your everything will be ripped off
but the underwear will stay the same.

53
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,327
This is the guarantee of Laxminarayan.

54
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,164
But your voice will rip my brain
off for sure.

55
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,730
Should I write it down?
I already have one.

56
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,025
You have one!
Then you should wear it.

57
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,502
How do you know that
I'm not wearing underwear?

58
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:08,867
You know about my nature.

59
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,804
And this is Laxminarayan Three.

60
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,836
I can tell the topic of letter
by looking at the envelope.

61
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,582
I can tell the size of the son
by looking at the father.

62
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,547
Wow.

63
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,852
He's been selling undergarments
since he didn't even wear undergarment.

64
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,514
He's made a undergarments factory.

65
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,515
Bulbul loungewear.

66
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,991
What is this?
Who are these slim girls?

67
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,297
Dad, they are our brand models.

68
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:37,993
And photo session is going on...
Model or their skeleton!

69
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,537
Look like they got sick
by wearing out undergarments.

70
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,298
Who will buy our undergarments?

71
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,971
We'll have to wear them all.

72
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:49,146
Underwear is okay, but who's
going to wear the bra? Your father.

73
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,714
Dad please don't use your words.

74
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,485
What is happening?

75
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,484
Uncle Shakespeare said,
What is in the name?

76
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,221
But he forgot...

77
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,724
What if three people share the
same name?

78
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,028
Laxminarayan One.

79
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,499
Laxminarayan Two.

80
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,989
Laxminarayan Three.

81
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,608
Diamond is worth 20 crores
and route is by road.

82
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,038
Go easily and come back with
the diamond.

83
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,181
Here, 2 bucks.

84
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,585
You'll get the diamond...

85
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,721
...when you'll give him this
half bill.

86
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,498
This diamond will bring that
diamond from Pondi.

87
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,749
Stop,
I know you have the diamond.

88
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,321
We are dangerous people.

89
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:26,117
He's running.
Scoundrel.

90
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,489
Don't touch me.

91
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,595
Say Chandu loves Chandni.

92
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,332
Sound so sweet,
Keep saying it.

93
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:44,340
You think I'm mad!
I mean let me show it also.

94
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,147
I didn't even touch.
I did nothing.

95
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,641
Chandu, There's someone at
the window.

96
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,419
No one is there.

97
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,763
Hey why are you peeking and
scaring my girlfriend?

98
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,896
I'm not scaring her.

99
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:16,234
Look at my back.
Hey why me?

100
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,941
Brother for god sake look at my back.
Hey I'm not like that.

101
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:20,975
Neither am I.

102
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,210
I've been shot!
Look at my back.

103
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,230
Stop the car.

104
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,171
I'll count to 3.

105
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,340
You can't die.
Shall I shoot.

106
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,742
This diamond is gone.

107
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,056
And the other diamond...
Fake diamond.

108
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,106
Papa will be shocked once
he sees it.

109
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,012
This is the 20 crores diamond.

110
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,023
Do you know?
Why do I've myself called Papa?

111
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,488
Why Papa?

112
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,890
Because Demelo only knows
about having.

113
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,063
Pa Pa...
Papa.

114
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,871
And you came back and
left the diamond.

115
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,922
You know that electricity only
comes for 2 hours a day.

116
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,129
And you let it go to waste.

117
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,159
Tell me...
Where is the diamond?

118
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,639
Like every time electricity went
this time too.

119
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,238
Now it'll be back Tommorow.

120
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,024
Where does it go?
When it leaves?

121
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,354
In the inverter.

122
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,729
Then turn on the inverter.

123
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,195
This is a joke for you!

124
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,771
We are also someone's child,
we lose our memory.

125
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,674
You made these bombs, Right?

126
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,641
Yes Papa I made it.

127
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,078
I have a diploma for making
bombs.

128
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,720
Now you'll die with this bomb.

129
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,522
Tell me, Where is the diamond?

130
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,680
Why won't it blow?

131
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,840
Papa, Bomb is here...

132
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,385
And you're using the remote
from there.

133
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,648
Come inside the range.

134
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,392
Should I press it while standing
on the bomb.

135
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,023
What kind bomb is this?

136
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,061
Why won't it blow?

137
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,092
Papa, Don't hit me.

138
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,800
Don't doubt my talent,
Bomb is fine.

139
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,131
I have a diploma.

140
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,197
Let me see the remote.

141
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,502
Here.

142
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,642
Battery is fitted wrong.

143
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,915
Now see how it blows...

144
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,821
Now tell me,
Where is the diamond?

145
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,123
Chandi look at this diamond.
Our luck will also shine like this.

146
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,232
After today, won't have to do
this sales job.

147
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,036
We won't have to live in this
car show room's wash room.

148
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,368
Won't have to listen to
Laila Madam.

149
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,766
Let's runaway.

150
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:46,376
Idiot, they must be looking
for us.

151
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:48,536
In one or two days...

152
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,878
Until then we'll have to put
it somewhere...

153
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,442
...no one can see.

154
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,585
I have an idea,
What?

155
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,249
This is gas, Why did you put
it in here?

156
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,323
See nobody can see it here.

157
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,591
This car is here for sale,
what if somebody comes to buy it?

158
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,096
Nobody came to buy it for seven months,
who will come now...

159
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,701
A man's death and
another woman over a woman.

160
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,410
Once catches up with you,
it never lets go.

161
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,870
And Yadav's death is catching
up to him.

162
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,244
Kill him.

163
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,148
Who shall we send?

164
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,116
After Heera's murder,
Police in Pondi is alert.

165
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,323
I've heard that you have a
vacancy for a shooter.

166
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,702
Give my son a chance to do
a murder.

167
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,504
I want him to get settled
before I'm dead.

168
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,610
His career gets developed.

169
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,611
Give this target to my Laxmi.

170
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,210
I'll do my best.

171
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:01,943
Give me one chance.

172
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,548
And if he fails this time,
he's not of one father, I tell you.

173
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:19,169
A sparkling rose and loose motion
never stays forever.

174
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:25,709
This time I'm sure that Laxminarayan
will come back with job done.

175
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,113
Bhai, I won't forget your kindness.

176
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,377
Bullet will go off so neatly
even you won't be able to notice.

177
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,013
But who's the target?

178
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,555
Poets have poetry,
walls have ears.

179
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,720
Leave for Pondi.

180
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,323
Your room will be booked
in blue diamond hotel.

181
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,358
You'll get a envelope there.

182
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,965
Whoever's address and photo
is in the envelope.

183
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,434
You'll have to kill him.

184
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,076
Get my diamond before killing
him.

185
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,442
I want that diamond at any cost.

186
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,708
Don't worry Bhai.
Have some opium and go to sleep.

187
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,387
I'm hearing a name that scary
for the 1st time.

188
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,891
Time is not good, let's go to
the village. We are in the village.

189
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,427
Let's go to the city,
Car is here.

190
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,992
I will kill him slowly.

191
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,802
Make a bomb.

192
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:28,733
Which blows.

193
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:33,075
Laxminarayan will come,
but he won't go back.

194
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,178
Listen to me carefully.

195
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,555
I've seen an old car on the
internet.

196
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,950
How is it, Sir?
I want to buy this car.

197
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,857
Leave for Pondi now.

198
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,629
Check the car and give 1 lac
as advance.

199
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,436
I will mail you the details.

200
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,469
Which mail, Sir?

201
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,102
Sir, Today's Zapack mail comes
very quick.

202
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,143
Fool.

203
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,248
I'll fax you from the computer
turn on the fax machine.

204
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,750
There are two fax machines here,
which one, Sir. Left or right?

205
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,422
Left.
Your left or my left?

206
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:24,324
My left.
Which position are you in, Sir?

207
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:25,628
Can't see on the phone.

208
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,302
This is your last chance.

209
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,613
Leave for Pondi right away.

210
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,711
Stay there in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Room will be booked.

211
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,747
I'll send you the details over
there.

212
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,560
Remember I want this car any how.

213
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,593
It's a gift for my wife.

214
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:02,130
Sir, Which wife?

215
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,962
One who's Bandra or the one
who's in Varli?

216
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,111
Why is he so angry?

217
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,713
Laila always checks the car thoroughly
before she buys is to sell.

218
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,628
Madam, My car!

219
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,230
This car of yours,
I can't sell it.

220
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,867
Nobody can sell it now.

221
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,765
We are from the ICUC Bank.

222
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,809
Madam, You took a loan of 2500000
for this show room of yours.

223
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,209
And you haven't paid your installments
since ten months.

224
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,922
Actually we are here to give you
a notice.

225
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:03,951
What notice?

226
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:08,395
If you don't pay in 5 days, we'll
take all of your cars.

227
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,331
You can't do this.

228
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,403
We can do it Madam because
we are scoundrels and bastards.

229
00:26:14,403 --> 00:26:17,041
I'll call the police.
We are the police.

230
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,477
We work part time with the bank.

231
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,107
Okay Ma'am, Have a good day.

232
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,986
Brother.
Give size 40 in this material.

233
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,760
What are you doing?

234
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,755
I'm taking out sister's bra.

235
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,198
Shut up, Son of bra.

236
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,304
If not Bra then what?
Pajama?

237
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,437
Teaching me.

238
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,943
Here it is madam 42 it'll
be perfectly fit.

239
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,841
Dad, listen to me.

240
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,581
Brother.
Not 42, give size 40.

241
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,019
42 will be perfectly fine.

242
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,422
Brother I said not 42,
give size 40.

243
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,921
What are you saying?
How do you know?

244
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,524
It's my size.
Do you know better or me?

245
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,991
I can tell the size of bra
by looking at the blouse.

246
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,992
You know my nature.

247
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,936
Her husband even ask me
for her size.

248
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,043
150 please.
Here.

249
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,911
Give me a bag.

250
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:34,313
What's the bag for?
You're going to wear it anyway.

251
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,444
Dad, You'll have to leave for
Pondi.

252
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,192
There you'll have to meet our designer
who's worked on our valentines collection.

253
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,388
Actually I've seen the designs
on the internet.

254
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,655
You just need to go and
make an agreement with her.

255
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,798
Okay I'll go.
Don't you worry.

256
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,568
And if you like the design
give her 100000. She need it.

257
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:55,137
Okay.
What her name?

258
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,942
Shut up, Not yours.
Leave the bra.

259
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,406
Speak.
Please write it down.

260
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,815
Pen is not working.
Dad leave it.

261
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,279
You just get to Pondi,
and go to the Hotel Blue Diamond.

262
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,317
I'll will courier all the pictures
and details.

263
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,717
Please Dad don't say bra and
panty over there.

264
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,128
Let's see how's her design.

265
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,233
I'm a designer,
You'll see...

266
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,261
...Name of my brand Pure Diamonds.

267
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,136
Will be on everyone's toung.

268
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,733
Whole world will wear my
undergarments.

269
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,537
Not less.
Not more.

270
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,480
Please leave.

271
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,726
It's simple.
Make me leave or I'll leave.

272
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,694
Actually you father and my father
were partners in this restaurant.

273
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,829
So either you buy the whole
restaurant or let me buy.

274
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,628
You know that I don't have that kind
of money. Why don't you keep half?

275
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,608
M.M. Munde never takes half.
Whole world knows that.

276
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:10,613
I will pay you back slowly, slowly.
How slow Jia Jee?

277
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,042
Tommorow at 11:00 my client
is coming here to meet me.

278
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,286
He'll like my design definitely.

279
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,882
And Jia's doors of destiny will
open.

280
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,023
Come Tommorow at 12:00,
you'll get the money.

281
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,694
Tommorow at 12:00, it'll be your
bad time or mine.

282
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,570
If just Laxminarayan likes my designs.

283
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,174
Here, Ticket.

284
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,539
Look son.

285
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,983
Do the murder nicely.

286
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,445
Mother, go now.
And remember...

287
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,751
If anyone give you food,
don't eat.

288
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:57,424
Those crimnals, they mix something
in the food.

289
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,629
And then they steal all the stuff.

290
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,060
Don't tell your name to anyone.
Keep that in mind and wait...

291
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,607
25000, you might need it.

292
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,268
Enough mother,
stop crying.

293
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,545
You have the gun, Right?
Yes mother.

294
00:30:17,545 --> 00:30:21,446
You have the ammo, Right?
Yes mother.

295
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,389
My son going to murder for
the first time.

296
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,487
Mother don't you worry.
Stop crying.

297
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,397
Buying for the kid.

298
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,565
I don't have 100000 in the bag.

299
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,908
Which one is going to Pondi?

300
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,148
The one, which is leaving...

301
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,036
What are you looking at?

302
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,305
This, Paharganj's peace.

303
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,268
It's Karolbagh's.

304
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:25,712
It's can't be Karolbagh's,
It's Paharganj's. Khurana's stuff.

305
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,612
This not Khurana's stuff.
This is my wife.

306
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,121
I'm not talking about your wife,
I'm talking about her bra.

307
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,086
It's Khurana's stuff.
He sells this cheap stuff.

308
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,320
Why the police?

309
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,451
Stand in line everyone.
Open your bags.

310
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,356
Open it.
Sure, There's nothing illegal.

311
00:32:16,356 --> 00:32:18,435
And you know my nature.
Why?

312
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,527
Are you my cousin?

313
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,438
You nature depends on my future.

314
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,706
What's all this?
It's all mine.

315
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,972
You wear this!
No, I sell these.

316
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,945
I was here on work so thought
I should bring it.

317
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,478
I thought I'd make some money
for the fare.

318
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,043
Please come...
Madam it's a perfect fit.

319
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,214
Show me the bag.

320
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,919
Which one Ma'am?
Right or Left?

321
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,160
Left.
Your left or my left?

322
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,262
Were you born in military?
Doing left right, left right.

323
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,557
Show me the other one.

324
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,397
Open the zip.

325
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,969
Ma'am there are two zip,
which one, front or back?

326
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,703
Take him away.

327
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:37,211
Check him, open every zip on
him.

328
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,815
And if you can't find the zip...

329
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:42,043
...then rip it then put a zip there.
Then open the zip and then check him.

330
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,220
Everything is sold.
It's the last one, for you.

331
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,900
Where is the dirty canal?

332
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,028
Why?

333
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,536
Are you going to clean it?

334
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,002
The Blue Diamond Hotel is right
beside it. I want to go there.

335
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,438
Do you see that bufalow?

336
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,370
Yes,
On the right.

337
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,907
Follow it.

338
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,279
It takes bath everyday in it.

339
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,764
What Madam?
You're just wasting time.

340
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,261
There's nothing in my bag.

341
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,436
I can see that you're a riot
without a weapon.

342
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,404
Show me the bag,
okay go ahead.

343
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,476
See this is a pant.

344
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,204
And this is my Gun!

345
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,174
Where did that come from?

346
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,819
Put the gun down and surrender.

347
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,650
Yes I'll put it down but first let
me think where it came from?

348
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,157
Give me the gun or...

349
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,885
I'll beat you so bad.

350
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:01,157
No Madam don't come forward.

351
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,728
A stupid fool like you will shoot me!

352
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,183
You're scaring a Jatni with spray.

353
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,399
Ma'am this is my gun,
actually the holi is coming that's why.

354
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,260
But when I saw your physique I got
scared and...

355
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,230
I hid the gun in his bag.

356
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,065
Let him go.
Please Ma'am.

357
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:45,837
Let him go!

358
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,042
Gentleman is telling me to
let him go.

359
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,347
Let him go.

360
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,852
You'll have to file an application
for it.

361
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,052
I obliged you,
Aren't you going to oblige me?

362
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,077
Sir is calling.

363
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,845
Must be the wife's massage.

364
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,246
Today I'm on duty.

365
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,114
Otherwise someone like you
has never been spared by me.

366
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,527
Get his information and let him go.

367
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,033
You came out to be intelligent.
You don't look like one. But you are.

368
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,065
But How did you put the gun
in my bag? I'm shocked.

369
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,403
You were standing before me
and I was standing behind you.

370
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,842
You were standing before me
and I was standing behind you.

371
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:03,613
You were looking on your left
your left.

372
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,685
I came slowly...
but that bag of yours, it was in the left.

373
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,263
Here is your gun,
and listen.

374
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,504
You met me here.
Don't meet me there. Understood?

375
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,980
I don't take help, not even
from my father.

376
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,383
You know my nature.

377
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,457
But I know your nature.

378
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,230
Your size is 52 but you wear 48.

379
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,923
How do you know, Sir?

380
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:54,367
If it was 52, wouldn't you be adjusting
again and again.

381
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,237
Okay, tell me which room is
under my name.

382
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,708
Your name, Sir?
Laxminarayan.

383
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:07,908
Okay

384
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,952
Listen. A letter is
suppose to arrive on my name.

385
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:13,818
One minute, let me check.

386
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,563
Here.

387
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,228
Please come,
I'll show you the room.

388
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,369
Laxminarayan, Which room?

389
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,141
Laxminarayan or Laxminarayan?

390
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,346
Laxminarayan, not nalayan.

391
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:37,640
Nalayan

392
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,849
But there's no Laxminarayan
staying here.

393
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,589
No?
No.

394
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,924
Wait.

395
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:50,859
He will stay.

396
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,393
He will stay.

397
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,403
I've a reservation.

398
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,893
Laxminarayan think or what will
people think?

399
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,269
I belong to a nice family.

400
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,943
What?
Laxminarayan?

401
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,348
I was looking for you.

402
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:21,212
No Sir,
I'm not the oil and cream man.

403
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,282
Come to corner.
No Sir, I'm not like that.

404
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,452
I won't do it again.

405
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,861
What are you doing?

406
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,503
I'm not like that,
You must be mistaken.

407
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,835
Actually my pant got wet that's why
was behaving like this.

408
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,275
Hold it.
No I won't.

409
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:54,679
Boss has sent this.
Take it.

410
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,951
Yes. Boss told me.

411
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,961
It's all there. Right?

412
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,787
Job should be done.

413
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,031
Otherwise your career...

414
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,446
No, don't say it out loud.

415
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,347
Don't say my name.

416
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,313
I'm not speaking to you.
Courier for Laxminarayan.

417
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,714
Mine.
You're Laxminarayan.

418
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:35,722
Is he Laxminarayan?

419
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,151
Yes he is Mr. Laxminarayan.

420
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,996
So you're Laxminarayan.

421
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,228
Sorry I didn't know you're
Laxminarayan. Now I know.

422
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,131
Sign here Laxminarayan.
Where Laxminarayan is written.

423
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:52,400
Thank You Laxminarayan Jee.

424
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,939
So Laxminarayan...

425
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:19,632
He is the target!

426
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,200
But Why?

427
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,273
Boss wants to buy this car!

428
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,309
He better buy a bicycle for
his wife.

429
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,210
Did you see that newspaper?

430
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,642
It's written here that 20 crores
Diamond leads to murder.

431
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,650
20 crores Diamond.

432
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,917
20 crores Diamond.

433
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,186
We should take it out of
the car now. Right?

434
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,518
Tonight we'll take it out
anyhow.

435
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:20,562
Really? Really.
It'll be fun!

436
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,122
How much money...

437
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,222
1000000.

438
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,100
The deal is fixed in 1000000
for this car.

439
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,433
This car!

440
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,303
How can this be?
That's what I'm thinking.

441
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:36,640
How can it be? No one came
to see it for seven months...

442
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,276
...now coming to buy it.

443
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,077
Who is the buyer?
Laxminarayan.

444
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,346
This car won't go anywhere
today because...

445
00:43:43,346 --> 00:43:46,285
...today at 11:00 Laxminarayan is
coming to see this car.

446
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,022
So both for you, clean it up.

447
00:43:49,022 --> 00:43:51,855
So when he sees it, He shouldn't
be able to take his eyes off.

448
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,964
Come at 2:00 and take the advance.

449
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:58,565
What are you doing?

450
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,970
What are we going to do?
We'll lose our diamond.

451
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,299
We won't let Laxminarayan get here.

452
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:06,909
We'll kidnap him.

453
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,805
I must close this deal today, I'll have
to impress everyone with my charm.

454
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,428
How do you know the name?

455
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,437
Since childhood.

456
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,536
How?

457
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,974
Who told your Papa?

458
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,538
Naturally Sir,
He'd know.

459
00:44:45,538 --> 00:44:48,583
If he bought undergarments from my
shop then off course he knows my name.

460
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,381
Laxminarayan
Undergarments Salesman.

461
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,346
My name is Laxminarayan.

462
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:53,556
You mean your...

463
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:55,885
Yes...
and you know my nature.

464
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,029
My name is Laxminarayan.
And I don't know your nature.

465
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,665
Nor I want to know.

466
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,335
Strange man.

467
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,437
Knows the name!
Not nature.

468
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,711
Laxminarayan's room?

469
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,813
There he is.

470
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,293
Why people runs away to take
D'Melo's name?

471
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,424
I don't understand,

472
00:48:59,069 --> 00:48:59,797
Mr. D'Melo.

473
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:01,934
Mr. D'Melo.

474
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:13,382
Excuse me,

475
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,185
Excuse me,

476
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,379
Anybody home?

477
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,292
Hello!

478
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,298
Hello!
Mr. D'Melo!

479
00:49:35,298 --> 00:49:37,463
Papa, he looks like Laxminarayan.

480
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:42,640
Wearing tie he came your home to
kill you, he thinks you are a dog.

481
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,281
Kill him right now,
No!

482
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:50,084
First, let's find out who is
this daring's man?

483
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:51,984
And who sent him?

484
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,424
Car is here,

Oh! Hello! Sir!

00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,499
Hands up!

488
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,203
You have a misunderstand, Sir!

489
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,134
I am Laxminarayan,

490
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,244
Put your hands up,
Left or right? Sir!

491
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,680
Both!

494
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,050
Your left or mine?

495
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,232
Papa!

496
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,908
Did she design bra and panty or car?

497
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,580
She is doing business in car
like you,

498
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,825
Nisha, mail it to Mr. Kumar and tell
him that...

499
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,555
Oh! Madam!

500
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:08,497
Yes!

501
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:13,125
You're the same in photo?

502
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,799
Yeah!
Who are you?

503
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,468
I am Laxminarayan,

504
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:25,481
Hi! I am Layla,
I was waiting for you,

505
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:31,913
Here we go, you deal in cars,
Yes, I deal in cars,

506
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,850
And you know my nature,
I deals in car too,

507
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,387
Where you keep your stuff?
Stuff?

508
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,827
Stuff,
This stuff,

509
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,700
I think you are desperate to watch?

510
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:51,440
Since I've seen that picture, I can't
see anything, What a design?

511
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:55,071
This stuff won't available in
Chandni Chowk,

512
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:57,941
If Khurana's will see then he
will be jealous.

513
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,943
Are you ready to make a deal?
Definitely, show me the stuff.

514
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:05,314
You know my nature, I can't make
deals without seen stuff,

515
00:52:05,314 --> 00:52:07,446
Come I'll show you,

516
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,119
This gun, found it from him.

517
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,621
I think it's English,
Chinese, Sir!

518
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,058
But it looks like English.

519
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,358

521
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:26,898
Sit!

522
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,302

You know I have to go for another
work, and you have ruined my face.

571
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,698
Where is Bathroom?

Whose left? Yours or mine?

573
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,915
Your Tamil will take my life,
And I am M.A. Munay.

574
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:56,848
Murli Manohar Monday,

575
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:01,050
You told me to come and get the money

576
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,493

00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:21,141
Then make your head cool and take
coconut.

580
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,281
Then sit under the coconut tree,

581
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,119
Not coconut, why you're saying
coconut?

582
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,251
You gave my money or I'll take it,
Sorry!

00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,799
May I have water?
Jia Jee, someone fire a bullet.

584
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,637
It's not like that you call some guys
here to kill me.

585
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,234
There are nobody,
Jiaa, M.M. Munday not enough, not less.

586
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,266
Bubble Gum.
Very much.

587
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:58,904
But Munday won't afraid to any bad
guy, you just wait here I'll be back.

588
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,252
What the hell?
Where is this Laxminarayan?

589
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,189
It isn't like this that he's here and
he's not recognizing you.

590
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,826
Yes.
It could be,

591
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:15,995
Eat sometime,
Excuse me, I need to announce my name

592
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,395
Laxminarayan!

593
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,398
Sir, I didn't came here to kill you.
I didn't came here to kill you.

594
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:29,706
Sir, trust me, I didn't came to kill.
Then whom you came to kill?

595
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:33,544
Sir, I didn't came to kill anyone,
Sir my Boss Mr. Pipot...

596
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:37,743
he told me to meet you, If you want
you can ask to Mr. Pipot.

597
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,681

00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,150

00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,727

00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:49,229
Where is your Boss?
He is in London,

601
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:54,535

afraid, Leave me, I'm giving you.

00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,399
0044786679.

603
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,910
It's ringing, It's ringing,

604
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:08,040
Sir, my boss is an educated man from
Oxford University, I'm his special man

605
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,210
He'll pick up.

606
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,386
It's time difference, it's morning
and he's busy in the mornings.

607
00:58:13,386 --> 00:58:16,583
Hello! Hello! Sir!
It's Laxminarayan.

608
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,128
Who Laxmi?
Sir, Laxminarayan, your Laxminarayan.

609
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,298
You fool, have you done,
Sir, there's a problem.

610
00:58:24,298 --> 00:58:26,368
That's why I want to talk to you.

611
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:28,630

612
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:33,341
I want results, you stupid, nonsense,

00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:36,578

614
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:38,941
Otherwise I'll shoot you, Idiot.
I know you love me.

615
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,710
I think it's disconnect,
International Calls

616
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,653
Papa, I told you before,
Kill him.

617
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:54,426
Thank you Papa!
Sir!

618
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:58,063
What you've done? You tell him
to kill me.

619
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,896
Sir, you can't do this,
Sir, try and under...

620
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,874
Which kind of sound is this?
Even Papa, don't know.

621
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,678
See, how much comfortable?
To Sit, To Lay.

622
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,207
You don't have adjust every time.

623
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:15,476
It's right, it must be comfortable
in the matter of get up and down.

624
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,616
Yes!
Otherwise, customers complains a lot.

625
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:21,822
You have to adjust while sitting,
walking,

626
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,525
Right!
Gents could do that,

627
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:26,959
but ladies have a problem with that.

628
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,464
Show me,
I showed you.

629
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,731
You told me about the side effective.

630
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,539
Show me the stuff,
What you want to see more?

631
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,937
This one. This, this.

632
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,205
I am showing you this since long.

633
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:49,950
Look, Madam since you're showing me
that's good but I am...

634
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,685
the perfect business man.

635
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:56,992
Till I didn't show the real stuff,
I don't make deals, this one.

636
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:01,386
Show me the red west and brief.
Full piece.

637
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,497
Here's your Boss stuff.

638
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,233
Bhai's diamonds,
I'm sorry it's late to delivery

639
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:17,005
you Boss must be angry with me.
Yes!

640
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:20,607
He's solid angry,
Please say him sorry from me.

641
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,385
I will be grateful to you for my
entire life.

642
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:28,054
Please! I am very upset and

643
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,521
I am sorry!

644
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,554
Please!
Just try and understand.

645
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,898
Excuse me!
I'll just come.

646
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,738
I can't kill her.

647
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,640
And when she return Bhai's diamond
then why?

648
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,849
I think electricity has gone, Papa.
Shits!

649
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,821
It's will be back tomorrow, Papa.

650
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,722
Don't you have Inverter?
What?

651
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,626
Don't you have Inverter?

652
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,698
Papa, he's challenging you,
I'll turn on the inverter.

653
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:22,471
Papa, forget about electricity and
kill him with bomb.

654
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:29,048
I am not that Laxminarayan,
It must some another Laxmi.

655
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,556
Have you gone mad?

656
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,822
That Laxminarayan lives in my hotel.

657
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:43,331
I saw him, you leave me Sir.

658
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,098
It's about my job.
No. Not at all.

659
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:53,202
There's another Laxminarayan, May be
he lives in Room No. 504

660
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:57,910
I am not that Laxminarayan, He must be
that under garments dealer.

661
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,983
If you lied to me then...

662
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,217
You're saying like I'll say something
and you will follow me.

663
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,818
Sir, do what you want,

664
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:13,855
Marveles Idea,

665
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:18,867
Come, show me, where is that
another Laxminarayan?

666
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:24,134
Papa, You take the tie, who will take
the tie man?

667
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:26,539
Don't worry,

668
01:02:26,539 --> 01:02:28,576
If you want stuff then you have to
show your stuff,

669
01:02:28,576 --> 01:02:31,873
and business happens like this, I
think you don't know about business.

670
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,749
I am in business from 40 years,

671
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:40,982
I will stop if you show me the stuff,
Yes or No.

672
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:44,288
What you thinking? Laila, If this
deal won't happen then

673
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,056
you can't take place your bank's
installments.

674
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:51,530
If the bank's installments would not
take place then everything will go.

675
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,630
But you will see from far.

676
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:55,799
And...

677
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:59,636
You won't tell anyone about this.

678
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,712
All right,
show me.

679
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,782
But not here,
Then where?

680
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,048
In your hotel.

681
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:15,755
All right.
Come.

682
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:20,995
Tell me who shot the fire?
Fire shot from there and we were here

683
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,632
And you.
Yes, Madam.

684
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,400
Then come.

Because of the way talked to you.

When?

826
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,872

You much have cut him.

1076
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:18,010
Kill by pushing the throat?

1077
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:20,342
How cheap your mentality is Bhai...

1078
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:24,340
just like egg of lizard.

1079
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:29,245
Do not take life,
give life to become Bhai(brother)

1080
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:31,053
You should learn some.

1081

I thought you have reputation.

1084

But now i know that you have no
reputation.

Did you kill her or not?

1086
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:50,141
No.

1087
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:53,276
Because i want to become Godfather.

1088
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:57,276
Godfather, even Chota Khujli can become
father too.

1089
01:35:58,018 --> 01:36:00,145
But one can become God when he
give life.

1090
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:03,413

Female?

1207
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:15,391

Chandu do something.

1211
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:35,739
See the diamond's worth is 200000000/-
it will be gone with the car.

1212
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,612
Now every thing is in God's hand.

1213
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:46,222

1214

Both of you are here you should
be shame of yourself.

1216
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:59,770
You killed that sweet and innocent
Laxmi Narayan and fled?

1217
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:01,499
Having the punishment for that same
sin.

1218
01:43:01,499 --> 01:43:04,344
Actually we thought he is the Laxmi
Narayan who was about to buy car.

1219
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:05,709
But he was not that Laxmi Narayan.

1220
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:07,040
Which car?

1221
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:09,972
A green old broken car, couldn't
sale even 7 months.

1222
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:12,309
If it could not sale for two day more,
that would be nice.

1223
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:14,350
Are you talking about 6121?

1224
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:15,451
Yeah,

1225
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:18,949
That's my car.

1226
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,921
I will transfer all the balance to AMI

1227
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:27,066
200000000/-!! If you will take 75°/°,
that would be good too.

1228
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:30,533

And Laxmi Narayan would be
on his way at 4 o'clock with money.

01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,751
Here's the 50°/° from advance.

I am taking this car.

1237
01:44:09,509 --> 01:44:10,476
That's my car.

1238
01:44:10,476 --> 01:44:12,943

You sold this car with lot of effect,
and she was saying no.

1245
01:44:47,914 --> 01:44:50,815
That's why Chandni made her unconscious,
yeah Chandni? Yeah... yeah...

1246
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:58,919
if you were hitting her then why you
were behind me?

1247
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:06,056
Dad please think one more time.

1248
01:45:06,533 --> 01:45:10,230

This diamond is four of us.

1254

02:02:38,250 --> 02:02:39,046

Turn minus on to plus,

1540
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:49,211

1542
02:03:51,490 --> 02:03:54,516
It doesn't explode, It doesn't explode,

1543
02:03:55,995 --> 02:03:57,462
You're insulting me from morning,

1544
02:03:57,863 --> 02:04:00,263

1549
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:12,978
You' re beating to the front of all,

1550
02:04:14,547 --> 02:04:17,038
If battery is not working then what
is my fault?

1551
02:04:17,383 --> 02:04:19,010
If we check to open the bag then
It isn't better?

1552
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:20,846
It's better,
Not better,

1553
02:04:21,153 --> 02:04:25,089
It is not a matter of bomb explode,
It about respect.

1554
02:04:25,089 --> 02:04:26,816
Now until bomb won't explode...

1555
02:04:26,816 --> 02:04:29,051

1556
02:04:30,162 --> 02:04:32,460

Shut up,
You don't talk much.

Come over here.

1561
02:04:43,909 --> 02:04:46,878

02:04:59,091 --> 02:05:00,183
You just add S,

1567
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:04,193
You add S on every single word
and English word.

1568
02:05:07,099 --> 02:05:11,035
People have one father in this world
and I have 550,000 Fathers.

1569
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:12,027
Right!

1570
02:05:12,404 --> 02:05:14,804
Papa, you don't have to do like this,
What else? Hey!

1571
02:05:15,074 --> 02:05:16,632

02:05:39,765 --> 02:05:42,495
Here's your clothes.

1580

Did you buy it from Pahar Ganj?
Yes.

1585
02:06:00,252 --> 02:06:02,186
It's Khurana's stuff,
How do you know?

1586
02:06:02,186 --> 02:06:04,049
Khurana sold this useless stuff,

1587
02:06:10,763 --> 02:06:11,695
I know,

1588
02:06:11,997 --> 02:06:16,024
To call Calvin Klein, he dress me up
Khurana's stuff,

1589
02:06:16,335 --> 02:06:17,802
You are such a miser man,

1590
02:06:17,802 --> 02:06:20,997
Calvin Kline didn't made underwear
like this.

1591
02:06:21,307 --> 02:06:23,070
Don't speak in public,
This man...

1592
02:06:24,443 --> 02:06:26,468
gave me electric shocks.

1593
02:06:26,879 --> 02:06:30,280
If electricity gone then hits me
on inverter.

1594
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,808
You don't cry, you just ask him.

1595
02:06:33,152 --> 02:06:34,744
Tell him about Sunday.

1596
02:06:35,321 --> 02:06:38,688
This Sunday or last Sunday?
Shut up you question answer,

1597
02:06:39,992 --> 02:06:41,619

Pinto!

1598
02:06:41,619 --> 02:06:45,491
Don't be angry,
You don't interfere, Batla Bhai!

1599
02:06:46,131 --> 02:06:47,792
You're like my younger son.

1600
02:06:47,792 --> 02:06:50,834
That's why I am telling you,
Who killed your Hira Lal?

1601
02:06:50,834 --> 02:06:53,370
We killed him,
Now that Hira Lal...

1602
02:06:53,639 --> 02:06:56,369
where he's gone to hide that diamond?

1603
02:06:56,675 --> 02:06:59,610
How do I know?
You tell me,

1604
02:06:59,945 --> 02:07:02,607
You must know little little,
Your memory has gone week,

1605
02:07:03,048 --> 02:07:08,281
Which Diamond, which car,
she was that car.

1606
02:07:10,089 --> 02:07:13,320
Papa!
These two are the same.

1607
02:07:14,693 --> 02:07:17,059
Speak,
Where is the diamond?

1608
02:07:17,396 --> 02:07:20,058
I don't know,
very good Chandu, don't tell them,

1609
02:07:20,332 --> 02:07:23,665
no matter what you lost your life,
but don't tell them.

1610
02:07:24,336 --> 02:07:25,268
Chandu!

1611
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:27,965
Where is the diamond?
Stupid, what are you doing, tell

02:07:27,965 --> 02:07:29,699

In petrol tank?
Diamond is mine, diamond is mine.

1614
02:07:32,675 --> 02:07:34,676
I bought the car then diamond
is mine.

1615
02:07:34,676 --> 02:07:37,315
I came here to buy car, diamond
is mine, I have a Gun.

1616
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:40,210
So diamond is mine, Papa.

1617
02:07:40,586 --> 02:07:42,952
But petrol tank is not opening,
Then how could we get the diamond?

1618
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:46,417
Ok, all you people turn it down,

1619
02:07:48,794 --> 02:07:51,092
What are you doing?
Vomit! Vomit!

1620
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:55,399
I am telling you to turn down
the car.

1621
02:07:55,399 --> 02:07:57,000
Which one?
This one or that one?

1622
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,865
I am sick of his question answers,

1623
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:03,137
How are you?

1624
02:08:03,409 --> 02:08:05,274
Give me two batteries,
Which ones, Big, Medium or small?

1625
02:08:05,274 --> 02:08:07,378
Remote batteries?

02:08:07,378 --> 02:08:10,515
VCD, DVD or TV,
To explode a bomb remote's battery.

1627
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:12,644
Khade chand!
Yes! Madam!

1628
02:08:12,985 --> 02:08:15,351

1635
02:09:07,339 --> 02:09:08,670
This diamond is mine.
Hey!

1636
02:09:09,575 --> 02:09:11,668
It isn't possible in the presence
of D'Melos Yadav.

1637
02:09:12,344 --> 02:09:15,313
Give me the diamond, Batlia.
Doctor, I would be fine or not?

1638
02:09:16,014 --> 02:09:17,242
Doctor, I would be fine or not?

1639
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:21,151
Leave me, Leave me, I'm not a Doctors,
Give it to me Yadav,

1640
02:09:21,954 --> 02:09:23,182
Give me the diamond,

1641
02:09:24,356 --> 02:09:24,845
Take it.

1642
02:09:26,859 --> 02:09:28,986
Who's the king of Mumbai?

1643
02:09:50,883 --> 02:09:51,975
Come on son, get on the car,

1644
02:09:57,689 --> 02:09:59,054
Don't get the trucks on car.

1645
02:09:59,324 --> 02:10:01,258
D'Melo hit with a stick,
One minute, One minute.

1646
02:10:01,593 --> 02:10:03,288
Stick won't do nothing,
through the bag.

1647
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:11,269
If somebody will move then I'll move
him.

1648
02:10:13,672 --> 02:10:14,764
I know everything.

1649
02:10:15,674 --> 02:10:19,371
That there's a bomb here,
Bomb? Who told you?

1650
02:10:19,371 --> 02:10:20,978
No bombs here,
No bombs here,

1651
02:10:21,446 --> 02:10:24,347
No bombs here,
No bombs here,

1652
02:10:24,716 --> 02:10:27,184
Mayawati Chotala's report never
wrong.

1653
02:10:30,689 --> 02:10:32,816
Hey Choudhry Albert Singh,
Where is the bomb?

1654
02:10:33,892 --> 02:10:37,157
He's just a child, how do he know
about the bomb?

1655
02:10:37,429 --> 02:10:39,920
Even I don't know that who is he?
There's no bomb here.

1656
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:42,697
Bomb's here.
Which is bombs?

1657
02:10:42,697 --> 02:10:45,269
Related to this battery,
Which is batterys?

1658
02:10:45,637 --> 02:10:47,400
Related to this remote,

1659
02:10:47,873 --> 02:10:51,240
This remote is not related to bomb,
Then whose remote is this?

1660
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:53,273
It is the remote of TV,

1661
02:10:53,812 --> 02:10:55,609
Where is TV?
TV isn't here.

1662
02:10:56,048 --> 02:10:58,016
We buy a remote, and TV
remains to buy.

1663
02:10:58,016 --> 02:11:00,084
So it is not bomb's remote.
No!

1664
02:11:00,352 --> 02:11:03,150
Bomb won't explode to press it.
No!

1665
02:11:03,789 --> 02:11:06,087
Then let's see to press it.
Yes! No!

1666
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:10,692
Then why are you afraid? If bomb is
not here then it won't explode.

1667
02:11:10,692 --> 02:11:14,162
And If it will explode then all you
people will be explode.

1668
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,858
Then one,

1669
02:11:16,435 --> 02:11:17,163
No! No! No!

1670
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:19,933
Two!
Where are you going?

1671
02:11:21,573 --> 02:11:22,801
Three!

1672
02:11:29,081 --> 02:11:32,278
No bomb here,
If it would be here then it explodes.

1673
02:11:32,584 --> 02:11:34,916
It must be explode.

1674
02:11:34,916 --> 02:11:35,866
It must be explode.

1675
02:11:35,866 --> 02:11:36,948
Shut up!

1676
02:11:37,322 --> 02:11:39,552
If somebody say a word then...

1677
02:11:46,231 --> 02:11:48,927
Papa!
Who speaks? Speak loud.

1678
02:11:49,234 --> 02:11:50,861
Hail Mata,
Papa!

1679
02:11:51,169 --> 02:11:53,160
Say it again,
Hail Mata,

1680
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:57,036
I am asking you, who's making
a sound? Papa!

1681
02:11:57,943 --> 02:11:59,672
Which papa's son is stocks there?

1682
02:12:00,145 --> 02:12:03,808
Papa, I forgot to tell you that
it's a time bomb,

1683
02:12:04,516 --> 02:12:07,781
By mistaken, I brought the time bomb
in the replacement of remote bomb.

1684
02:12:09,388 --> 02:12:12,619
Tell me when it will explode?
It will be on 18:00

1685
02:12:13,692 --> 02:12:16,422
By the way what time is it?
One minute, One minute,

1686
02:12:16,422 --> 02:12:21,123
there are only three seconds left,
One, Two, Three,

1687
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:27,438
Does it explode? Papa!

1688
02:12:32,611 --> 02:12:35,808
From pinto's bomb not a people,
but diamonds appears in pieces.

1689
02:12:36,548 --> 02:12:38,982
It's saying that nobody will have
before time and more than limits.

1690
02:12:41,053 --> 02:12:42,520
Everyone get his share diamond,

1691
02:12:43,488 --> 02:12:45,353
Laxminarayan and Jia also takes.

1692
02:12:45,657 --> 02:12:47,750
With that share they buy a restaurant.

1693
02:12:48,527 --> 02:12:51,360
And Laxminarayan's mother still wants
that her son become a shooter.

1694
02:12:51,797 --> 02:12:53,287
And she says to every Don...

1695
02:12:53,287 --> 02:12:57,162
And if this time he fails then he's
not a son of one father.

1696
02:12:58,537 --> 02:13:02,769
Laxminarayan 2 buy some shares in
virus auto from his shares...

1697
02:13:03,108 --> 02:13:05,269
today he's in the board of directors

1698
02:13:05,577 --> 02:13:06,635
And his Boss Pipot,

02:13:07,012 --> 02:13:08,240

Your left or mine?

1704
02:13:16,922 --> 02:13:18,287
Laxminarayan 3

1705
02:13:19,391 --> 02:13:22,758
Not in car but he sells underwear in
bus and his brand ambassador is

1706
02:13:23,295 --> 02:13:23,852
Laila!

1707
02:13:25,163 --> 02:13:29,099
Mayawati Chotala's become a jailor to
gave her share in bribe.

1708
02:13:29,768 --> 02:13:34,705
