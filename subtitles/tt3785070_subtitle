00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,800
All the characters, events and chronology
in this film are totally fictitious...

2
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,280
Any resemblance to any person or incident
is just a coincidence....

3
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,760
Do words write themselves?

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,520
Mother and I - Are we the one and the same?

5
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,880
Let me not abandon myself...
Joydeb Bose

6
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Sir...

7
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Hello Sir...

8
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
What is it?

9
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,040
Give me some medicine...

10
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,920
Stomach upset or fever?

11
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
None of that...

12
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,640
I cannot write in Bengali any more...

13
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,720
Literacy problem?

14
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
But you don’t look like that...

15
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,000
No, not literacy problem...

16
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,200
My hand is not moving for writing

17
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
I see

18
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,880
Have you hurt your hand?

19
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,120
No, I didn't get any hurt....

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
The hand is not obeying me...

21
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
I know now, you are drunk

22
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,640
No. I haven’t been drinking

23
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Oh God...

24
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,200
Are you a mental?
But I do not have those medicines...

25
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,680
You go home now...

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
I will close the dispensary....

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,440
But I need a medicine, Sir...

28
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,480
Wait,let me see...

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,240
Hereit is, Kolkata Doctors’ Directory

30
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
Who look after the mental cases?

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,680
I think...

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
Psychiatrist...

33
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Found it...

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Dr. Abanti Basu, MD, MRC
Psych, UK, Consulting Psychiatrist

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,880
After taking the medicines for triglyceride,
pressure and cholesterol....

36
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,200
Whenever I close my eyes,
the hen is laying colored eggs...

37
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,120
Eggs are of the same colors as of the tablets...

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
It sits and blob comes out the egg...

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Sorry, you are a female...

40
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,080
I should not say all this in front of you...

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,360
But the moment I close my eyes,
the hen starts laying eggs...

42
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,200
And when I open my eyes,
my wife is shoving cucumber in my mouth

43
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,360
Okay, I am prescribing you
one egg every Sunday...

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,840
And gave a medicine for your colored illusions...

45
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,280
You don't have to come again...

46
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,160
Maam, your fees...

47
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
Pay it ouside...

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,680
Ok, bye...

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,240
My eggs...my eggs

50
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,960
Hello, mom...

51
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,600
I shall be late...have your dinner....

52
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,280
I know that your husband and
father in law both were doctors...

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,200
And used to practise in this chamber...

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,800
They were never late but I'll be...

55
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,200
But you must eat on time,
or your sugar would give trouble

56
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,080
Ok, bye...

57
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,400
There are no more patients,
should I

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,480
What is this?

59
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,560
He has come in
without permission ...

60
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,320
Hookah faced rascal, homeland is Bengal...

61
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,520
Who are you?

62
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,920
I came to you to know that....

63
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,400
Hookah faced rascal, homeland is Bengal...

64
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,080
Hookah faced rascal, homeland is Bengal...
He never use to laugh....

65
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,800
Who has asked him,
“Don’t smile, be grim”?

66
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,800
Did anyone find out?

67
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,400
Hookah faced rascal, homeland is Bengal...

68
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:43,520
Recently...

69
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,800
Recently...he was writing poems...

70
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Poems! Poems! Poems!

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,440
His lips bore the touch
of early moustache...

72
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:02,400
Drivers were drinking wine with chickpeas...

73
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,000
Hookah faced rascal, homeland is Bengal...

74
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:24,600
Then for few days...was a shortfall...

75
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,120
Shared 'double half', coffee cup

76
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,800
Very soon State-God
Shoved a lethal rod...

77
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,640
Police bullets’ lead
revolution lay dead...

78
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,880
Hookah faced rascal, homeland is Bengal...

79
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,800
Mainline lefties
with their hefties

80
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
Came to limelight and
enjoyed great might...

81
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Fell from great height
lost the poll fight...

82
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Red lost to the greenvery culture-keen...

83
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:23,920
Playing Tagore songs
At crossings all day long

84
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:37,200
On the other hand
Now the Bangla Band

85
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Belting Beatle hits
Audience in fits!

86
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:52,200
In this long walk,
Shunning native talk

87
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:01,480
Bengal lost its idiom

88
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:11,920
None is bengali, everyone is 'Bong'...

89
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:22,800
Our medium is English...

90
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,520
Hookah faced rascal, homeland is Bengal...

91
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,320
A poem called 'Hookah faced rascal'

92
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,200
I suppose thats well known...

93
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,840
'Hookah faced?'

94
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,360
Yes...'Nonsense Rhymes' by Sukumar Ray...

95
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
Do you want it?
Yes...

96
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Just a minute...

97
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,600
Take the collection of Sukumar Ray...its a good one...

98
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
You can teach your children

99
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,000
There is no other book like this

100
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,480
Father of Satyajit Ray...
He died at the early age of 36...

101
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,960
Look at his eyes...a genius...

102
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
What did you find?

103
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,080
Pressure level in the brain is normal.
There is no such problem...

104
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,040
I'll never be able to write again?

105
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,840
What do you want to write?

106
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Anything. In Bengali.
That’s why I have come to you

107
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,640
What is stopping you from writing?

108
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:42,080
Your hand X rays and test reports are
not showing any physiological problem...

109
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
I understand

110
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,320
But I cannot write a single
alphabet in bengali...

111
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
Just a minute...

112
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,640
Take this pen and paper and write...

113
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,400
I have come to see the doctor

114
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,120
You can write very well and handwriting
is also nice...

115
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,520
I can take dictations but cannot
write on my own...

116
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,360
But my profession
was to write in Bengali...

117
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,000
You have to believe that
you can write again...

118
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,320
You have to find out when and
why the problem began...

119
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,040
You say, I'll listen...

120
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,640
Start from the very beginning....

121
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,240
Don't miss anything...

122
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,480
I heard of the first incident
from my mom...

123
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,800
I was then only four months old..

124
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,920
She is my mom....

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
Here is your milk darling.
I am here

126
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,520
I want only breast milk

127
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
What?

128
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,800
What did you say?

129
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,200
Listen, Come here quickly...

130
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,600
Do you know what your son just said?

131
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,080
What did your son say?
Mum mum of papa papa?

132
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,520
Soma, at this age all kids make those
sounds...

133
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,280
The food movement is spreading across Bengal

134
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,400
You only talk of politics

135
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,400
The kid is doing so many things
You have no interest

136
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,520
At least, I got a baby in ten months

137
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,560
You couldn't bring about a
revolution in your entire life

138
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,560
Here is your milk my darling
...have it...

139
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,240
Breast milk is pleasure
for both you and me

140
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
My God. Unbelievable

141
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Listen, your son is talking at 4 months

142
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,040
No one can save him from being
an Einstein now

143
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Are you coming here or not?

144
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,000
I can’t read the newspaper in peace.

145
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,360
All the time your son is
doing brilliant things

146
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,200
Give him the terracotta replica of the
Nobel trophy

147
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
He is the next Nobel Laureate

148
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,960
See, what he says when I give him the milk

149
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
What would he say?

150
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,760
See I am taking this bottle close to
his mouth and he will talk...

151
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,760
My darling...

152
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,680
You and your son.

153
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,040
Let me go to the market

154
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,640
Believe me, he was saying

155
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
What?

156
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,760
I can’t say it, very naughty things

157
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,960
Let me go to the market

158
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,400
Why did you embarrass me
in front of your Dad?

159
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,040
Breast milk has no substitute

160
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,120
This is that feeding bottle

161
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,200
As long as mom was alive,
she had preserved everything

162
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,840
And this is my poetry book

163
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,400
Collected Works of Roopchand .
Mom's own handwriting

164
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,600
Mom had thought that I would be big

165
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,320
And a middleclass housewife would
come into limelight

166
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,000
So she would write down all the rhymes
which I recited

167
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,640
Bird on a tree, ever so sweet
How about fetters on its feet?

168
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Second rhymes...

169
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,280
A tiger’s coat is only a dollar.
Has no buttons,no collar

170
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,640
Men have no boobs
Women do

171
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,800
Men are a happy bunch.
Women rue

172
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,200
Alongside the poems, mom
drew these illustrations

173
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,400
Mom was a good painter....

174
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,720
No one trained her

175
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,000
But you note one thing

176
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,600
She didn't draw for the third rhyme

177
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,240
Anything even remotely sexual
would make her nervous

178
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,960
I don’t know how she did all that
was required to conceive me

179
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,680
But mom wanted to teach me everything

180
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,160
She didn'tt know English so she sent me
to an English medium school

181
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,560
Dad had objections...Political

182
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
He wanted to send me to a Bengali school

183
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,960
But he couldn'tt stop mom...

184
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,960
Good morning, Mam

185
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,720
Good morning, Children

186
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,640
Mam

187
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Yes

188
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,000
I need to shit

189
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,760
Speak in English,don't speak in Bengali.
Speak in English please

190
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,120
I eat.
Get shit

191
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,200
Bad smell, you hate...

192
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
Toilet.
Toilet

193
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,800
Stop

194
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,800
You will be a great person...

195
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,200
People would salute me as your mother

196
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,080
Just learn English.
No one can stop you

197
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,240
No one taught me English

198
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,000
You will go abroad l will sell all
my ornaments and send you

199
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,680
You have to learn English

200
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,200
Toddle, toddle, naked bum
,
you must dump Mother tongue

201
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,760
Pick up English
Become big fish

202
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,560
My dear son...

203
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,200
And your Dad?

204
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,520
Where was he in all this?

205
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,800
I don’t know

206
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,520
He was a quiet person.

207
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,920
I heard he was a left wing union guy
in some government office

208
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,600
Used to return home late.
He was also into drinking

209
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,120
Mom didn'tt care much
for a 'clerk' husband

210
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,320
Because he didn't do anything big....

211
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,160
And to mom it was important
to be a great person...

212
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,880
You know the problem inside Bengalees

213
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:56,120
The Bengalees who have stayed
back in Kolkata have no ‘fires’

214
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,440
You are so right, Hori da,

215
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Sorry, Brother Harry

216
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Look at me

217
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,800
‘Looks’ at me

218
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,840
In the age of the 70’s,
I went to U.S.A.

219
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
'By ships'

220
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,480
I settled there

221
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Now I am ‘standing’ there.
Got a Green Card

222
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
You know Biju

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,960
He who remains sitting,
his ‘ ‘lucks’ also remains sitting

224
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,720
‘Lucks’, I mean fortune

225
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,360
Don't tell him anything, Harry da..

226
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,840
He won’t go anywhere in life

227
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,040
I am thinking of sending Rupu
abroad

228
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,360
Admitted him to an English Medium School

229
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,960
He is learning English

230
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,600
He would be like you

231
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,840
Won't you be like your Harry uncle?

232
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,200
Recite the English poem
you composed for Harry Uncle

233
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,240
None has seen such a nation ever....

234
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,440
America, America, Land of Bikini!

235
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,480
All white women lie by blue sea
wearing bikini

236
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,720
With dress, topless, as far you see

237
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,840
Batman, Spider -- all in USA

238
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,800
Jolly good Hollywood that too is there

239
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,840
If in this world, wannabe big man

240
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,800
Go US. Go US. Go US, if can!

241
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,920
Wonderful!

242
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
Your son is very ‘brights’!

243
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
You have to take him there

244
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,240
Eat the jackfruit cutlet.
I have made it myself

245
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,960
You cannot get this there

246
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,600
Now you get everything there

247
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,920
What job do you have there?

248
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,400
I mean ‘whats jobs?’

249
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,240
I! Executive

250
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,880
Executive?

251
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,800
Harry D Paul

252
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,520
Crockery Care Executive

253
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,200
You wash the dishes and put
them back on shelt...

254
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Will you shut up?

255
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,440
Soma, your husband is very funny

256
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,200
Soma, your husband is very funny

257
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,160
Sense of ‘funs’

258
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,120
Then stay in contact.

259
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,800
Let us 'touches'

260
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,480
O! I forgot, ‘Kids’,
I have got something for you

261
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
Wow! What is this?

262
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,280
I know I know,
the Statue of Liberty

263
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,800
Statue of Liberty New York stand

264
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,000
Symbol freedom in great new land

265
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
Refugee coming in big numbers

266
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,080
Farmers, mechanics and plumbers

267
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,520
All come with heart full of hope

268
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,400
Statue, statue, please please,
give some scope

269
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,520
This is wonder on this earth

270
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,400
1-8-6-5 year of birth

271
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,600
I learn all this whole world story

272
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,200
In my book on global history

273
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,200
Next generation, ‘hopes’ of ‘nations

274
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
‘Goodbyes’

275
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,600
Harry uncle never contacted us again

276
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,920
Mom wept a lot after he had left

277
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,920
She knew in her battle to bring me up
Dad would not help her

278
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,320
Your parents had no normal relationship?

279
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,920
Like a husband and wife would have?

280
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,520
I never noticed anything like that

281
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,000
Maybe Mom’s obsession with
me created a distance between them

282
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,040
Mom used to sleep with me in
one room and Dad in another room

283
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,680
This is that Statue of Liberty Key Ring

284
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,400
Your Ma had kept this also?

285
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,400
She used to keep everything

286
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,560
A lot remained unfulfilled
A lot left to be done

287
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:39,680
I just live with the speed of
flowing on in your veins

288
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,600
A lot remained unfulfilled
A lot left to be done

289
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,440
I just live with the speed of
flowing on in your veins

290
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,960
I shall smilingly turn into ashes to
become the earth in your hands

291
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:21,520
I want to be the face of the icon
you are going to make

292
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:34,120
A lot remained unfulfilled

293
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,560
This life is all about the
desire for the next

294
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,920
The wings of the next will
break the cage of this birth

295
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,600
Even if I miss that birth,
I know you will be there

296
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,160
I have built you with my own flesh and blood

297
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,760
I shall dance as your hands
I shall race as your legs

298
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:25,200
I shall die for you in wars
like a fresh recruit

299
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:48,120
A lot remained unfulfilled

300
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:58,000
A lot left to be done

301
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,880
My speech shall live on in your words

302
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,600
My hope shall live on in your enunciation

303
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:51,400
A lot remained unfulfilled

304
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,400
So late?
Should I ask Subal to heat your dinner?

305
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,360
Don’t worry Ma

306
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,440
Why should I worry?

307
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,680
My daughter has come back
from England as a doctor

308
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,000
Now she can take care of everything

309
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,800
Don’t fight over everything

310
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,400
Which book are you reading?

311
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,200
Collected works of Sukumr Ray

312
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,160
After so many years

313
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,920
It’s such great fun

314
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,880
When did you
buy it?

315
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
2 days back

316
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:43,200
From your Murakami and Coelho
suddenly Sukumar Ray? What happened?

317
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,560
Why? I never read Bengali?

318
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,720
Now I am reading about the
‘Hookah faced rascal’

319
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,720
Who is this rascal? Some patient?

320
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,560
You must know everything!

321
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,600
Ma

322
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,720
Do you love me?

323
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,200
Only as much as you let me love

324
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,320
f I let you to love me more, what would you do?

325
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,520
Don’t know

326
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,120
But why suddenly you are asking all this?

327
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,160
You always go around with an air of
‘Stay away'

328
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,880
How I can pamper you?

329
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,800
If a mother lives her life around her kid,
both get into trouble

330
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
Maybe

331
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,840
But if the kids always keep a distance
it is not a lesser problem

332
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,240
Ma

333
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,120
Let me go of. The book will be ruined.
What a crazy daughter you are!

334
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,960
Rupu, go and study

335
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,280
You are scoring poorly in English.
You have to study more

336
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,120
Rupu, I will beat you

337
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
F..k you

338
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,040
What did you say? You scoundrel

339
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,240
I will give you a big slap

340
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,040
This is what you learn in an
English medium school?

341
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,920
What happened?
What did he say?

342
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,360
He used horrible slangs.

343
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,800
Go...lick the feet of
colonizers

344
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,000
Next, he will translate the Kamasutra

345
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
What are you saying?
What did he say?

346
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,040
In Bengali, it would mean

347
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,880
So I stopped going to English
medium school

348
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,120
They stopped you from
going to school?

349
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Yes. Ma was like that

350
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,160
Once something got to her head,
it would stick

351
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,120
The school was for learning
English, not expletives

352
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
So no more of that school

353
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Then?

354
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:02,160
Dad used his political contacts to get me into a
Bengali school in the middle of term

355
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,440
In the same class

356
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,280
He was very happy that
son would learn Bengali

357
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,320
Ma also pounced on me
to teach me Bengali

358
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,400
She herself was
looking for justification

359
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,800
Thus began my desperate struggle to
learn Bengali

360
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,120
As if Ma announced a war

361
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,840
See how many great old Bengali ads

362
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,440
Oil your hair with ‘Kuntalin'
Perfume your clothes with ‘Delkhosh’

363
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,600
Fill the world with fragrance,
Praise the manufacturer, H. Bose

364
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,560
Ads in Bengali

365
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,880
Do you know who H. Bose was?

366
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,120
A relative of Satyajit Ray

367
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,480
Kuntalin had announced
prizes for short stories

368
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,040
So many
great stories were written

369
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,000
Then so many lines by
Tagore have been used in ads

370
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
Look, for food products:

371
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
The tongue is the
greatest abode of desire

372
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,440
In ads for tea: Come the restless
Come the 'thirstea'

373
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,440
In ads for hair oils

374
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,920
‘Thunder hides in the cumulus
clouds of your untied hair’

375
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,760
Don’t be naughty. You will
also write in Bengali like that

376
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:19,200
Now everyone is writing in English.
You'll make a name in Bengali

377
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,880
Must you make Bengali a market commodity?

378
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Satyajit Ray also worked in advertising

379
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,000
Then there is no point
arguing with Bengalees

380
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,080
You?

381
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,600
You are Roopchand...
...Sen’s mother

382
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
My name is Soma Sen

383
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,400
I have seen your photo

384
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,160
How are you finding the case?

385
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
Will he get well?

386
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,400
My Rupu cannot write in Bengali.

387
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,560
This is a grave crisis

388
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,440
I haven’t started treatment as yet

389
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,000
But listening to his story also works as therapy

390
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,760
You are very important in your son’s life

391
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
I know

392
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,640
The reverse is also true.
My life also revolved around Rupu

393
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,440
So I thought I would tell you a few things

394
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,160
Don’t tell him that I came

395
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,840
No, that is alright

396
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,280
I put my soul into teaching him Bengali

397
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I wanted him to be big, famous,
among the who’s who

398
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,000
I also wrote poetry in my youth.
Nothing came out of it

399
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:31,800
I don’t even know if they can
be called poetry. Should I recite one?

400
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Yes, please

401
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,960
Little girl, why do you wish to touch the sky?

402
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,320
Strings and knots, coming of age
and the clock

403
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,480
And your body all tied up

404
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,200
Do you like Bengali?

405
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,440
Haven’t really thought that way

406
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,720
But recently, for this case,
I am getting back in a new way

407
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,040
Who is your mother’s favorite poet?
Do you know?

408
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,640
Find out

409
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,760
Children know very little
about their mothers

410
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,800
When Rupu was born,
I wrote a few lines of a poem

411
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,760
Never finished it

412
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Mothers don't write poems

413
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:31,720
“When you were born,
They all came to see you

414
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,000
And you broke into smiles

415
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,320
I was in turmoil
searching my body and soul

416
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,760
Was there anything else
I could claim as my own?

417
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:57,680
I want Roopchand to get well. Be happy

418
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,000
Please help him to recover

419
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,240
Can you not marry him?

420
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,000
Marry?

421
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,760
Me?

422
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,680
Him?

423
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,520
Why?

424
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,560
That’s true, why?

425
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,240
I am very fond of this poem:

426
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:25,280
The tiger’s coat is only a dollar.
Has no buttons. Has no collar

427
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,360
The rhymes are very nice

428
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
What happened?

429
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,480
May I come in, Sir?

430
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Come in

431
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
My mother, Sir

432
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,280
You have come to a job
interview with your mother?

433
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,440
That is why Bengalees
are not landing jobs

434
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,640
I would not
have 'landed' without her

435
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,920
Well said, You changed
the concept of 'landing'!

436
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,720
Stop talking rubbish

437
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,400
This is not a seminar on Freud or Oedipus

438
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,440
Will you do the job together?

439
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,480
Are you Laurel and Hardy or Tom and Jerry?

440
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,840
My son takes me everywhere

441
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,280
You two just hold hands and go home

442
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,240
He does not have to go back alone

443
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,360
Schools are now interviewing mothers

444
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,400
Stop talking nonsense

445
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Look Madam

446
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,800
Please wait outside or
we have to cancel the interview

447
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Take a seat

448
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
You will write copy?

449
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,920
Yes Sir

450
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,000
Why do you want to be a copywriter?

451
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I have copy coming out of my pen

452
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,080
What is advertising?

453
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,280
Promote in a special way...

454
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
Sing praise of even rotten goods

455
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,200
You seem to be spunky

456
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,840
What is this?

457
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,000
A can of kerosene, Sir

458
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,280
Suppose kerosene is not selling in the market

459
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,920
Because people are using cooking gas

460
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,600
Can you create a new market
and sell kerosene?

461
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,280
You have to find a new use

462
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,720
Not yet exploited by
any brand

463
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Will a song do?

464
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,440
Song?

465
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,560
Jingle Sir, for radio and TV

466
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,000
Go ahead
...Sure

467
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:19,000
If you don't get the car
or the house as dowry

468
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,520
Douse the bride's body

469
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:32,320
With sweet smelling kerosene

470
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,760
Bride Burning Kerosene.
Bride gone. Dowry on

471
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,040
Totally new market sir

472
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,960
Lots of in-laws are using it.
But no one has created a brand for market

473
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,240
Marriage again. Dowry again.
Benefits again

474
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,200
The sweet sound of coins.
Raging tongues of fire again

475
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Douse the bride's body

476
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,280
With sweet smelling kerosene

477
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Bride Burning Kerosene. Bride gone. Dowry on

478
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,480
Well....

479
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,000
Brother, come and see the frame

480
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,360
No. You are the boss

481
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,280
This is your age to learn

482
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,920
Beloved Vermilion
Give your wife a red salute

483
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,200
Guess who’s been adjudged
the Employee of the Year

484
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,080
Could I see the frame?
Ah

485
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,760
Am I pressing it the right way?

486
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,800
Actually your two fingers

487
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,760
Let me take a look, wait

488
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,760
A.B. Das’ Rasgullas
Press it and suck it

489
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,360
I am thinking of painting the house

490
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,400
Which paint should we use?

491
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,680
Berger. Berger is the best

492
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,400
The bedroom is looking nice

493
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,160
It’s Berger, Madam

494
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Sir

495
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,480
Is this house no. 26?

496
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,920
Yes. It is.
But, what do you want?

497
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,360
I have to deliver a fridge and a TV

498
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,000
But my salary has not increased

499
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,720
Drop it here

500
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,240
We have won the Runtop Tyre account

501
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,520
Big hand for Roops

502
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,600
Runtop Tyre. No prestige-puncture!

503
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Let me show her

504
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,800
Slurp Slurp Icecream

505
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,120
A one night stand for the tongue

506
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,600
Sir, Please see the frame

507
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
But you are checking it

508
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,040
Your frame sense is something else

509
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,080
Gorgeous Sari. Looks good
when on. Even better when off

510
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,800
Is the sari burning out?

511
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,520
Need to adjust...

512
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,720
He does not need a light meter

513
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,560
Push that light back

514
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,640
The hand closer to the body

515
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,400
Super Clean Detergent Bar

516
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,120
Cleans everything except a stain on character

517
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
You like it?

518
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,600
Why are you so late?

519
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,800
What reason do I have to
get back by sundown?

520
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,120
There was a party meeting

521
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,320
You needn’t have painted my room

522
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,480
I do not contribute much to this household

523
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,800
Is this ad also written by your son?

524
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Which one?

525
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,760
Beauty Queen Brassiere--
Don’t keep things hanging

526
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,040
Yes. This ad won them the client

527
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,760
Five other agencies from
Kolkata had pitched.

528
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,280
Rupu’s
agency won the account, for this ad

529
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:47,120
Your son writes such rubbish, and you,
his mother, keep mum?

530
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,040
He has to write according
to the product.

531
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
Who am I to say anything?

532
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,360
Do you know his office is sending
him to Singapore for training?

533
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,160
He is the first Bengali copywriter to be
selected

534
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,200
Training for writing in Bengali,
in Singapore...Great !

535
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,800
So you taught him Bengali to
write this pornography

536
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,560
Now he should start sleeping
in a separate bed

537
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:26,000
What did you say?
How can you utter such things?

538
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,480
Nothing

539
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,920
When you took him out of the
English medium school

540
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,920
I thought, great!
He needs to learn Bengali

541
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,040
But this kind of language?

542
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,800
One has to write all kinds in work

543
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,240
Dirty minds will seek out the dirt

544
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,800
When he wrote, “Get close with Rose Perfume”
and won a prize,you kept mum

545
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,080
For the Bengali almanac:
“Know your fate, date by date”

546
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,080
And won accolades but you stayed quiet

547
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:07,080
You have to make the language
dance around for claps?

548
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,560
He has to be successful

549
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,400
I have not brought him into the world
to be the loser son of a loser father

550
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,480
These things are like
memory containers to you

551
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,520
We have to work on the
basis of these things

552
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,000
I am actually I am trying to
work on a graph or link

553
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Have you found anything?

554
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,760
Your story has two strong elements

555
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,280
One
is mother and the other is language

556
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
You are right

557
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,360
Don’t you think both are the same?

558
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,600
Mother and Language cannot be separated?

559
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,000
In a way, it can be said
Mother-Tongue

560
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,680
Never really thought of it that way..

561
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,320
Mother tongue: Mother's hope!
Mother's pride!

562
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,880
Things were fine in advertising

563
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,120
Ma was very happy, Dad was not

564
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,160
And I was also enjoying as I had
a good position in office

565
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,680
Things changed after a while and
upset our lives

566
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,720
Did you call me sir?

567
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,400
Take a seat

568
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,520
Let me get to the point directly...

569
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,720
You must have heard our Company is
closing its operations in Kolkata

570
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,200
There is no business here.
Big brands are all leaving

571
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,560
It is impossible to maintain a full office

572
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,280
There will be a sort of post office,
with only one staff member

573
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,160
So I have lost my job, Sir

574
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,680
Well, yes

575
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
Let me take your leave sir

576
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,800
If there is no service, there is no servant
Let me go home

577
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,080
I like your sense of humour

578
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,200
‘How long will I guard that
which continually gets lost’

579
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
From Tagore, Sir

580
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
All the best to Tagore

581
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,120
Today I met Tapan in the market

582
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,600
He was saying that there are
queues again for government jobs

583
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,880
The private sector
proved to be unreliable

584
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,280
Slightest problem and
there is a flight of capital

585
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,120
Where is that talented son of yours?

586
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,560
He is unemployed now

587
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,720
He can help you with
housework

588
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,400
Sorry, this is a forbidden topic

589
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,520
Let me take a shower

590
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,320
(Bell rings)

591
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,760
Rupu, see who is there

592
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,840
May I come in, Sir?

593
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,080
Come in

594
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,040
Why are you touching my feet?

595
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,920
I am a local boy, Sir. My name is Fatik

596
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,080
We have never been introduced.

597
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,560
Shall we go inside?

598
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,720
Let's go in

599
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Who is it?

600
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,840
Someone to see me, Ma

601
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,520
You are the famous Ad Guru, Sir

602
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,360
We grew up reading your ads

603
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,720
‘Fry aubergines in liquid gold’ for cooking oil,
‘Felt it melt in my mouth’ for ice cream,

604
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,240
'Catch the news, Don't hatch eggs'
for a magazine

605
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,520
After Tagore, you are the one, Sir. Ad Guru

606
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,560
Will you give me gas or cash?
What is the work?

607
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:58,360
I knew Sir, you are a professional.
That’s why I had the courage to come

608
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,000
They said, Fatkiri, will he do such small jobs?

609
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,240
What exactly do you want?

610
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,800
Will you write some cards, Sir?

611
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,640
Cards, for what?

612
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,680
Now in West Bengal,
there is only one slogan

613
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,040
Catch the small fish. Eat them up

614
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,360
Small customers, Sir millions.
There is no big business

615
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,920
Weddings are increasing
at a galloping speed

616
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,400
Potato weds Gourd

617
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,520
Onion weds Fry

618
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,000
Sunny weds Demoness!

619
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,800
if you write 1,00,000 wedding cards

620
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,600
And get 50 rupees for each,
you can make 5 million rupees

621
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,240
Money by the minute, Sir

622
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,880
So don't sit idle, make some money

623
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,000
Research is my responsibility

624
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Research?

625
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,720
That is my USP sir

626
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,120
Custom-made cards for all customers

627
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,000
Full bio-data for biographies

628
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,200
Look

629
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,720
It is the First-Rice Ceremony of this kid

630
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,360
Just pen a line and make 50 rupees

631
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,600
There are thousands of cases like this

632
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,640
His father is a doctor, mother a fashion model.
The kid’s name is Gurey

633
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,200
If you can touch upon
the doctor and the model, Sir

634
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,880
If there is a personal touch, no one
will buy readymade cards

635
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,600
Sir. 50 rupees

636
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,200
Your account is open now

637
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,800
Put down your stetho Papa,
leaving patient behind

638
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,360
Forget your photos, Mummy,
It’s my First Rice time

639
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,360
I am Gurey your son.
Your most loved one

640
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,760
You have added butter to
his first rice. Wow, Sir. Wow

641
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,080
A little kid won’t talk like that

642
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,600
Puth down your thetho Papa,
leeb pathen behindh

643
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,000
Folgeth youl phothos, Mummy,
Ith’s my fasth lice thime

644
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,600
I am Guley youl son.
Youl mosth lovedh one

645
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,600
Wow Sir, how affected, how saccharine.
The market will love it

646
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,080
I have an off the track demand.

647
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,640
One of my customers is
eyeing his sister-in-law

648
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,800
If you
could give me a caption,
upmarket, poetry type

649
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,360
I can pay you a little more for this.
Rs.75

650
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,880
Here it is. 50 and 25

651
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,240
It’s ok

652
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,920
Poetry?

653
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,200
I know

654
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,520
Sister-in-law, take the load off your chest,
become my 'out-law'

655
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,960
Sir, This is why they call you Bengal’s Ad Guru

656
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,800
How well you have brought in that
‘Zero Figure’ thing

657
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,080
Zero figure’?
Yes

658
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,920
I brought it?
Yes

659
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,600
“Take the load off your chest"...

660
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,600
It is a strip-tease of Bengali language!

661
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:20,800
I must pay you 25 more and
make it 100 out of 100

662
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,440
Strip-tease of the Bengali language?

663
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,200
You? Again?

664
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,160
How is Rupu?

665
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,880
Your ups and downs affected him deeply.

666
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,600
Your depression... when he lost his job

667
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,080
That was not only for him losing his job

668
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,480
I was being defeated

669
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,640
After he lost his advertising job

670
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,680
Fatik helped him to earn some money

671
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,200
After all an income, some work

672
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,360
I used to collect these cards from Fatik

673
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,400
But all of it was so small time

674
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:45,000
The language of Rupu,
which I had trained him to develop

675
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:52,440
Was being wasted in
all these paltry jobs

676
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,680
I was not feeling good...

677
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,520
It was like a small dirty pond

678
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:08,200
If you took a dip in it,
the moss stuck to your body

679
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,280
Wait

680
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,960
Let me go. Rupu will
come any moment

681
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,600
He will come at seven

682
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,640
I need to tell you a few things

683
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,440
What is it?

684
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,280
You had put too much pressure on him

685
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,720
Everything has to be
measured by success

686
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,560
A job or a language has no
meaning on its own?

687
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,240
It is a dangerous premise

688
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,200
What is dangerous?
Who are you talking to?

689
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,160
You? When did you come in?

690
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,320
The attendant sent me in.
Should I come later

691
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,320
No. No. You were next

692
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,760
These are the cards written for Fatik

693
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
When did I give these to you?

694
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,880
I have become
s o forgetful

695
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,320
I must have told you the story

696
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,200
No. Your Ma

697
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,920
I mean

698
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,440
You gave me the cards the other day

699
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,120
Actually, you are
in a stressed condition

700
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,600
You can have a temporary
loss of short term memory

701
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,360
That is nothing...but

702
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,920
I did not know that Ma used to take
these cards from Fatik and keep them

703
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,520
We did not have much conversation

704
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,360
She had become silent

705
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,560
When I got to know, it was too late

706
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,600
She had taken many sleeping pills

707
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,640
The hospital could not do much

708
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,240
She was so dramatic

709
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,720
She left us in the sari that I bought
her with my first salary in advertising

710
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,640
Fatik managed it all. He printed
wedding cards for the police big shots

711
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,920
Otherwise we could face a lot of hassle

712
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,000
Fatik did not ask me to write
the card for her memorial service

713
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:37,440
I spent my hours on the market day

714
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:49,800
Buying the loads of people’s words

715
00:54:49,960 --> 00:55:00,640
O my mind, relieve me of
that burden of words

716
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:11,560
Be silent and just listen, only listen

717
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:23,000
There is a song playing in the
wind that takes us across

718
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,320
On the strings of a lyre

719
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:41,240
On the distant bank of the river of tears

720
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:52,760
The steps leading to your door can be seen

721
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:20,240
(Interval
)

722
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:27,440
Why are you so worried?
Have you found a maddening mad guy?

723
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,280
Stop talking nonsense

724
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:36,000
Whatever you say, there is a Mills &
Boon look on your face

725
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,520
Would you shut up?

726
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:44,480
This pendant seems to be new.
Where did you get it?

727
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,640
Senco Gold. Where else?

728
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,080
I really liked the design

729
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,600
You always choose the best

730
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,360
So, tell me what’s new

731
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,000
Something strange has happened

732
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,400
I have seen the mother of a
patient twice, very clearly

733
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,760
Just like I am seeing you now

734
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,200
But she is dead

735
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,200
There is no question of her
coming to my chamber

736
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,160
What is the problem?

737
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,640
Why are you so bothered?

738
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,920
What are you saying, Srila?

739
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,840
A psychiatrist having hallucination?

740
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,720
I would see a woman who is dead?

741
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,280
When we get involved with a case...
counter-transference can happen

742
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,280
And maybe the visual
imagery is related to that

743
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,200
You are imagining that you are
seeing the mother of a patient

744
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,160
This case of visual imagery
is rare

745
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,960
But we make so many imaginary
interactions with patients’ families

746
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:57,360
What we cannot say to the patients,
we imagine telling their families

747
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,320
The other day, I was having
a debate with the family of a child

748
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,600
And then?

749
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,960
I woke up from my dream

750
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,440
And you know what Rajat said?

751
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,800
Apparently I shouted ‘What nonsense!

752
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,560
And was about to suffocate
him with the pillo

753
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,640
You are always joking. Do you think
I was sleeping in my chamber?

754
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,600
Election is approaching.
What shall we do now?

755
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,400
Our politics has reached the limit

756
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,320
But we have not crossed city limits

757
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:37,400
We started as a Red Party.
But it has lost its vibrancy and become Maroon

758
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,600
But we have not been able to come to power

759
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,920
Comrades, sorry Com-Maroon friends

760
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,880
We need to do something this time

761
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:57,840
I shall lose all my teeth before
we form a government

762
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,560
Shut up. A toothless has become a leader

763
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,880
Why? Is a toothless person a class enemy?

764
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:13,000
ou cannot spit on a class enemy,
you are spitting all over me. Old fool

765
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,560
Hey, no aspersions on ‘Old Pool’
(name of a place)

766
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,960
I myself have built a very
militant organization there

767
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:26,600
One is toothless, the other is deaf.
We need fresh blood

768
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:32,400
If you keep fighting among yourselves,
how shall we achieve anything?

769
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:38,960
The people are very unhappy
with the party in power

770
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,400
It is a golden opportunity.
But the problem is language

771
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:52,200
I have translated the writings
of all great leaders directly from Russian

772
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,520
At the opportune moment of therevolution,
a rejuvenated working class

773
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:04,760
Powered by righteous class hatred,
will annihilate the Mensheviks

774
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,000
Bull shit

775
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,680
I lost my teeth saying all this

776
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,480
How can we fight tooth and nail with
toothless, nail-less characters?

777
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,800
Who needs revolution?
We need a government

778
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,040
Yes. But for that we need a slogan

779
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,560
Real power does not come from the barrel
of a gun, it comes from a slogan

780
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:32,120
What are you saying comrade?
Sorry com-Maroon

781
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,800
We need to do a proper election campaign

782
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,720
Son, I need to talk to you

783
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,000
What is it?

784
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,760
I was saying

785
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,120
You have to write an advertisement

786
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,880
Want to remarry? Need a matrimonial ad?

787
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,600
Groom Government servant. Widower.

788
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,600
Owns a bachelor son and a house in Calcutta

789
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,600
And the bride?

790
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,200
Pulling my leg?

791
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,920
Our party needs an election campaign

792
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,360
A campaign for your party?

793
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:38,760
I will do the campaign for your party?
But all that is bourgeois...

794
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,760
Don’t talk rubbish

795
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,400
Our politics is correct.
Maybe the language is old

796
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,280
We need a new language
to reach out to the people

797
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,520
It was always needed, like
Mayakovsky

798
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,040
Have you started early today?

799
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,960
Is this the rum talking?

800
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:06,720
No. Our party has decided that
you will do the election campaign

801
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,800
We won’t be able
to pay
you much, but if we win

802
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,320
“Opposition will be Marooned.”
No it can be even simpler

803
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,680
“Vote for Maroon or be Marooned”

804
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:27,000
“Decide in the coming elections.
Vote for Maroon, or be marooned”

805
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,200
No further delay
We want Maroon today

806
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,560
Break the prison of the tyrant

807
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,760
Why beg from door to door?

808
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,520
No further delay

809
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,000
Awake young women,
Awake young men

810
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,640
Let them know that you have risen

811
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:07,000
Surround the old fogeys in
the voting booths

812
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,560
No further delay
We want Maroon today

813
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:18,720
Break the prison of the tyrant

814
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,280
No further delay

815
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:34,560
Maroon has ended the reign of death
Glory to Bengal

816
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:41,240
So the Maroon Party has won.
What have you gained?

817
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,200
Sir, there has been an order
for 25 glasses of tea

818
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,880
Go. Give it to the others, go

819
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,800
Maroon has ended the reign of death
Glory to Bengal

820
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,360
Thank you, Rupu

821
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,880
Maroon has ended the reign of death
Glory to Bengal

822
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,880
I still believe slogans do not win elections

823
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:10,520
People have not voted our slogan,
they have supported our ideology

824
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:15,000
I believe we have won
the elections for the slogan

825
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,120
It has given us an extra push

826
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:26,320
Did the Clock of Time just chime?
Let us then commit suicide

827
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,240
Whatever the know-all local leader may say

828
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,520
Their state leadership understood the reality

829
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,760
So I became their Poet Laureate

830
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,480
By the way, you are looking different today

831
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,680
Did you believe in what you wrote?

832
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,000
The question is not of faith, but skill

833
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,920
My pen was then backed by
the might of the government

834
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:04,360
That power helped this Rupchand Sen
to take over the Bengali language

835
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:15,640
Drimi drimi beats the drum
Sounds a doom for tape worm

836
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,400
No more shitting in the fields
Only sowing for better yields

837
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:28,760
Drimi drimi beats the drum
Sounds a doom for tape worm

838
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,200
Friends

839
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:35,960
Lavatories built with State support
are lying unused

840
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:41,000
On the other hand, maladies caused
by tape worms are increasing by the day

841
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,160
No more shitting in the fields
Only sowing for better yields

842
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:53,240
Therefore, to encourage local people
to use lavatories

843
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,280
we have organized a ‘Sit and Shit’
competition for the grown ups

844
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:11,120
Get a lavatory, you just shit
Government will pay for it

845
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:21,800
Get a lavatory, you just shit
Government will pay for it

846
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:27,520
And each competitor will get a free
plastic bucket and a mug

847
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,440
Do not go to open fields to defecate

848
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:43,400
From the shit will come worms

849
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:52,200
From the shit will come worms, very obstinate

850
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,360
Do not go to open fields to defecate

851
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:24,080
Support Maroon or be marooned

852
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:43,600
Dear friend I wish I could sign my name
like you

853
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,880
Dear friend

854
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:00,280
Let us enroll ourselves in the
literacy program

855
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,520
No more thumb impressions,
I want to write alphabets

856
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,520
The village council sits every month

857
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,120
Representatives of the Rural
Self Government attend

858
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,760
District Party Leader comes
in a milk white car

859
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,240
Hands are raised to pass his proposal

860
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:27,000
Self Help Groups of Women make a racket

861
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,400
The Village Head’s voice is also heard

862
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:38,000
Brother Chuni, do you
recognize me? I am Debdas

863
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,400
Where is my beloved Paro?

864
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,920
Shame Debdas, shame.
You have not given up drinking?

865
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,360
Bengal now has a
working class government.

866
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,000
Victory to labour

867
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,600
Brother Chuni, You have changed

868
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,840
Yes. You must change as well

869
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,880
Don’t you drink anymore?

870
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,600
Chandramukhi?

871
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,160
You are right

872
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:14,400
Now I cultivate Chandramukhi potatoes.
2 quintals of yield per acre

873
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,280
The Government has given us fertilizer, water

874
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:23,520
The Maroon Government is committed
to give us fair price

875
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,000
How is my girl Parbati?

876
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,200
Parbati is now a member of the
women’s Self Help Group

877
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:39,200
She had taken a loan for her husband’s
rickshaw and paid it back in record time

878
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:44,840
She took tetanus injection and
iron tablets before child birth

879
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:49,200
Then let us proceed on that road,
Com-Maroon

880
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:49,920
right

881
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,400
Down with petit-bourgeois romanticism

882
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:01,400
We must cultivate Chandramukhi potatoes.
We must. We shall

883
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,320
This is how the annexation began

884
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,400
Bengali language was the first to be annexed

885
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,000
I was in the driving seat

886
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,760
Greater than Tagore.
I had no beard, but who cared?

887
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,960
Success?

888
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,640
The river Ganga
was flowing through my pen

889
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,720
Then

890
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:29,400
Many years and elections passed...
The days changed again

891
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,240
The Maroon Government
started to shoot people in rural areas

892
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,280
Questions were raised: Why so
much blood shed?

893
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:43,040
One fine morning I found myself unemployed

894
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,400
The Maroon Party did
not need my services any more

895
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,320
Then one day

896
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,800
Sir? Are you very busy?

897
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,880
Not at all. You? After so many years?

898
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,080
You are now the ‘Poet Laureate’
so we dare not come

899
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Please sit

900
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,200
Fatik, I write campaigns for clients

901
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:13,000
Maroon Party had given me work,
so I did it

902
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,560
Now they do not require my pen so
I am unemployed

903
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,640
Which card should I write?

904
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,640
This time it’s about voter ID cards

905
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,880
Maroon party has been around for a
long time Let someone else come

906
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,360
We can also do well

907
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,400
Is your Dad
home?

908
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,200
No. Why?

909
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:45,120
Would you do the campaign for the
Yellow Party?

910
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,800
Yellow Party? I have heard the name

911
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,400
But why Yellow?

912
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,640
They started as Green

913
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,440
Opposing the Maroon for 20 years
has turned them Yellow

914
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,200
But they are yet to grab power.
I have told them about you

915
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,960
They said, would you change side?

916
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,200
I would request you to change the jersey

917
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:19,560
If you do the election campaign for the
Yellow Party, they will surely win

918
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,080
Would you come once to their party office?

919
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,200
I shall take you by car and drop you back

920
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,560
We are people of few words

921
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,960
Public does not want the
Maroon Party any more

922
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,400
There is unrest all around

923
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,240
Now people want ground to
bury the Maroons 0

924
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,400
You write some slogans for
‘Vitcory’ in the elections

925
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,520
Do not worry about the money

926
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,160
'Vitcory'? Oh, I see, victory

927
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:53,080
We say, ‘vitcory’ in Bengali

928
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,280
Fatkiri printed my daughter's wedding card

929
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,320
Don't you also print the Voter ID cards?

930
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,880
That is under Central Govt., Sir.
They are depriving us

931
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,240
Let it go. I will see to all that

932
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,440
I am a man of fast decisions.

933
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,040
What is that Polite bureaus?

934
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,640
Politburo.

935
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,440
We don't have all that. Full young blood.
Just like me

936
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,840
Body is a bit old but the blood is new.
OK. You go ahead

937
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,000
No worry, Sir

938
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,480
Rupchand Sir is Ad Guru.
Bengal’s future is total Yellow

939
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,600
One minute. How about this?

940
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,440
Anoint Bengal with turmeric Yellow

941
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,320
Anoint with turmeric Yellow
You mean marriage?

942
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:41,280
Anoint Bengal with turmeric Yellow
Unmarried women will find their match

943
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,800
Wedding. Feast. Night of union.
New home. New life

944
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,640
Sowing. Germination. Yellow crops.Wow!!

945
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:56,200
Sir, I had told you. Give me your leg dust

946
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,160
You understood so much hidden meaning?

947
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,760
Ok. It is your line of business.
I won’t throw a spanner.Ok then?

948
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:24,720
The Belle of Bengal is
dying of hunger

949
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:29,240
We shall anoint her with turmeric Yellow

950
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,960
She shall have a happy home
She shall row the Boat of Vote

951
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,320
And sail to a home of happiness

952
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,080
The Yellow of golden crops
The Yellow of the golden sun

953
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,320
Will return to Bengal

954
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,920
The Yellow of golden crops
The Yellow of the golden sun

955
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,760
Will return to Bengal

956
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,320
This time, Bengal will glow with Yellow

957
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,200
According to reports coming in

958
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:00,960
The Yellow Party is heading toward a landslide
victory in West Bengal

959
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,720
Defeating the Maroon Party

960
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,840
The Chief Minister of the Maroon Party
has lost to the Yellow Party candidate

961
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,760
By over 10,000 votes

962
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:19,680
Results in Maroon bastions are showing
clear signs of a Yellow wash

963
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,680
A Yellow Storm has risen in Kolkata

964
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:27,600
As
Yellow Party supporters are throwing
yellow powder at each other

965
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,760
Soma, you must be happy

966
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,600
Your son has beaten me again

967
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,200
Dad passed away

968
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:19,320
We were not on talking terms but at
least there was one more person at home

969
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,480
But yes. I changed sides
and scored a winner

970
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,240
We have won the elections

971
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,880
But some people are after us

972
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,600
Foreign style. Cartoons, jokes

973
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,760
We shall not stomach all this.
Do a proper campaign against them

974
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,960
Oh, then it can be

975
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,640
"I shall hang with a smile,
India will witness"

976
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,480
Fatkiri, this is your domain. Is this alright?

977
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:56,080
Brilliant. If you laugh, you will be hanged

978
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,200
So symbolic.You
have surpassed yourself

979
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,320
Leg dust is must

980
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,160
But soon, my ‘yellow writing’ was over

981
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,680
I know there has been a mistake

982
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,800
I have called for that scoundrel

983
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,840
Duluda, the culprit is here

984
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,040
Welcome, welcome

985
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,920
Fatkiri has run away.
But how far would he go?

986
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,680
This is the result of trusting you

987
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,480
But you approved of all the ads

988
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,280
Shut up

989
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,480
I am getting insulted in
my party because of you

990
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:42,200
“I shall hang with a smile" what nonsense?

991
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,560
You are passing on the blame to me?
Why would you write it?

992
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:56,240
All are saying that we have made
martyrs of our critics

993
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,800
Listen, you have to write a
counter-line by today

994
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,360
All newspapers will carry it tomorrow

995
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:08,800
"Western style slander or West Bengal:
Whose development do you want?”

996
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,120
Is there any hidden meaning?

997
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,600
Are you a mole of the Maroon Party?

998
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,120
I only serve the Bengali Language

999
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:23,040
I am loyal to Tagore, Nazrul, Sukumar Ray

1000
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:28,120
Keep quiet and wait here.
I will get it approved and then you go

1001
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:32,840
"Western style slander or West Bengal:
Whose development do you want?”

1002
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,960
This cultural side is making me go crazy!

1003
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,240
Let me come back and then you leave. Bapi

1004
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,160
Yes sir

1005
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,680
Make sure he does not run away

1006
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,000
(Phone rings)

1007
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,960
I am done. I was shouting at someone.

1008
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,120
It is complete. I’ll be right there

1009
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:54,200
That was my last job for the Yellow Party

1010
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,800
Did not see Fatik any more

1011
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:03,000
You can say that I was a martyr in the
battle between the Maroon and the Yellow

1012
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:09,240
No more problems to solve.
No work

1013
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,840
No advertising company, no Maroon Party,
no Yellow
Party

1014
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,400
who would tell me what to write.

1015
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:20,000
Who would force feed people my words

1016
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And so my pen dried up

1017
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,960
Can you imagine the pain?

1018
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:35,920
I am sitting with my pen for hours,
Not a single word is coming out

1019
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,560
I have been conditioned

1020
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:44,680
I cannot write unless
someone tells me what to write

1021
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,160
I cannot write on my own

1022
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,800
You have identified your problem

1023
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,520
You have to write your own thing

1024
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,160
There must be a reason to write

1025
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,640
All your life you have written to order

1026
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,400
That is why this crisis

1027
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,160
Think what you
, yourself want to write

1028
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:18,800
Not to anyone's order or dictate,
for yourself

1029
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:23,360
Something you
yourself
want to write really badly

1030
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,160
It is easily said. But

1031
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,360
Mr. Sen

1032
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,160
Please send me a coffee

1033
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:25,240
When the warmth of the coffee cup
suddenly touches your lips

1034
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:33,840
Mist clad memories drizzle gently

1035
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:40,760
Words yearning for a home
rain in a silent rhythm

1036
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:48,920
Days go by, nights pass,
Time locked in a secret chest walks alone

1037
01:21:48,920 --> 01:22:04,800
When the warmth of the coffee cup
suddenly touches your lips

1038
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:40,480
The evening like a glow worm
lights up the sky

1039
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:54,440
And the mind in flight,
half remembers a face

1040
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:28,960
Spread the news of your flight
Wipe memories of calls missed

1041
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:34,600
And why the futile wait
rapt in lost ringtones?

1042
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:41,960
Let the wild wind blow,
and the storm rage

1043
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:48,320
Let the voyage begin

1044
01:23:48,320 --> 01:24:10,760
This song knows that
love is a journey against the tide

1045
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:04,560
When did you come? Subal never told me

1046
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,880
You were watching TV in your room

1047
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:12,560
It was an old classic.
I could not stop watching

1048
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,680
But why are you lying down?

1049
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,120
Don’t know. I am feeling very tired

1050
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,840
Has anything happened?

1051
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:35,840
Ma, how do parents feel
when kids grow up?

1052
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,400
Meaning?

1053
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:43,840
You can’t scold them,
make them listen to you

1054
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,400
So finally you understand

1055
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:53,200
Now that you have grown up and
become independent

1056
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,240
Now you are beyond my treatment

1057
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,960
You know Ma, doctors
feel the same way

1058
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:06,960
As long a patient is coming to see you,
you are concerned about him

1059
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,400
Trying to treat him

1060
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,800
But if he walks out and does not return

1061
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,000
Then you can only worry. Isn’t that so?

1062
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,560
Don’t worry so much.
Can a doctor alone handle it all?

1063
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,960
How is his financial condition?

1064
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,720
His family? His care givers?

1065
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:38,240
You can't keep track of all this

1066
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,160
Europe has that service Ma

1067
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,800
When I was practising there,
we had social workers

1068
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,720
They would make home
visits and report to us

1069
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,160
It will take a while for that to happen here

1070
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:52,960
Come, have your dinner

1071
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:11,880
You have identified your problem

1072
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,760
You have to write your own thing

1073
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,080
All your life you have written to order

1074
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,600
That is why this crisis

1075
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,200
Think what you
yourself want to write

1076
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,320
Not to any one’s order or dictate,
from your own need

1077
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:30,800
Something you
yourself
want to write really badly

1078
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,880
Fatik? Where have you been?

1079
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,880
Why the suitcase?

1080
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,000
Keep it in the corner

1081
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,320
We are waiting outside

1082
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,000
Wait in the club room

1083
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,600
May I leave this suitcase here?
No problem, I hope

1084
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,600
Unless it explodes. Come upstairs

1085
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,280
Where are you off to?

1086
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,560
It's been a long time

1087
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,960
There is a lot to tell you

1088
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,080
They are demolishing our slum
to build a highrise

1089
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,800
They are bringing the Police

1090
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:26,040
We are also getting ready
to stop them. Any how

1091
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,400
Never could buy an apartment, Sir

1092
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,400
Now the room in the slum will
also go

1093
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:38,160
So I am leaving my suitcase here.
Will come and collect it later

1094
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:42,320
Haven’t you informed Dulal Babu
of the Yellow Party

1095
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,560
After that incident with you

1096
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,640
I went to him this morning

1097
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,600
He said Police will do their duty

1098
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:08,000
But before the elections
he had pledged support

1099
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:14,680
Before the vote you promise a banquet,
But a kick in the belly is all we get

1100
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,240
Wow. It’s a great slogan:

1101
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,400
Hey, I could think on my own

1102
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:31,720
Before the vote, you promise a banquet.
But a kick in the belly is all we get

1103
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:37,520
I wanted you to write some slogans for us

1104
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,800
Tonight we are going to write posters

1105
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:47,040
But I cannot offer you any money,
any political contacts

1106
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,960
Shut up. Let's go

1107
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,040
Where?

1108
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:56,720
To write more slogans. One is not enough

1109
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:00,000
You will come to our slum?

1110
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,240
I will go to the procession also

1111
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:09,080
Otherwise, how would I know the
power of what I wrote!

1112
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,120
Lets go

1113
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,240
Quick. We do not have time

1114
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,240
What about this one?

1115
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:18,440
Stealing our homes to build
your square feet! You shit

1116
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,800
Bravo...bravo...

1117
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,400
Here is another:

1118
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:28,400
Smashing the roof over our heads
to build your marble floors

1119
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,400
Fatikda, the Police and promoter’s men have
come with powerful lights and bulldozers

1120
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,160
They will evict us tonight

1121
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,200
Quick. Quick. Let’s go

1122
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:44,320
You stay here

1123
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:51,200
Sleep baby sleep.
The bulldozer's kiss will make your sleep deep

1124
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,640
Subalda, where's the newspaper?

1125
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,800
Here it is

1126
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:20,880
City Violent over Slum Eviction

1127
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,400
We have scuttled the demolition plans

1128
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:28,080
Now it will go to the courts

1129
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:32,680
But they won’t have the
guts to return soon

1130
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,120
But in the bargain,
you got hit on the head

1131
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:43,600
You won’t understand Fatik,
I have got my pen back

1132
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:50,680
Did you lose your pen? In that melee?
How did you get it back?

1133
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,200
It must be the garbage collector.
Tell him to go away

1134
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,600
Ok

1135
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,560
Wait. I am coming

1136
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,640
Someone to see you, Sir

1137
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,840
Who is it?

1138
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,360
Dr. Basu, you?

1139
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:29,000
You also made the same mistake.
My name is Srabanti

1140
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,840
People say Dr. Abanti Basu and
I are identical twins

1141
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,880
The head injury seems to be serious

1142
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:41,400
Have some tea. I do not have coffee.
I can ask Fatik to get for you

1143
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,400
Please sit

1144
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,240
Do not bother. I don’t drink tea or
coffee that often

1145
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:50,280
Actually Abu has had to go outside
Kolkata

1146
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,240
So she asked you, I mean me,
to return these things

1147
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,240
Otherwise, if you go all the way
to collect them in vain

1148
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,920
Abu is so organized

1149
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,080
She got your address from the appointment
book and gave me this sealed packet

1150
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,560
And repeatedly told me not to open it

1151
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,400
The key ring, album of ads, poetry book,
everything is inside

1152
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,880
Its so heavy

1153
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,120
Let me go now

1154
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:18,400
Please sit. What’s the rush?
Would you like some water?

1155
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,520
Water? No

1156
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:27,400
Actually I am very weak in Bengali.
Abu said you are very strong in Bengali

1157
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,120
Would you teach me?

1158
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,880
She has told you this too

1159
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,840
Is this ok by medical ethics?

1160
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:41,400
This is not really classified information

1161
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,640
Let me go

1162
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,800
Why don’t you sit?

1163
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,000
I go to your chamber every day,
and you have come to my place

1164
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
That's not my chamber

1165
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,880
I have not come, Sabu has come

1166
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,200
That's Abu's chamber

1167
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,800
Anyway, I have to go

1168
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:02,320
If you go, I have to lie down again
like a Hookah faced rascal

1169
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,960
But you came away without
completing your treatment

1170
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,600
My God. Dr. Basu has told you that too!

1171
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,200
She has not said anything.
Once your pain subsides, go and visit her

1172
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,400
I have to go now

1173
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,880
Where did she go?

1174
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,080
How would I know?

1175
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,080
I got orange juice from Haru’s shop

1176
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,920
These types of ladies prefer
sugar-free orange juice

1177
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,000
Oh. A Ph.D on Women!
Drink it yourself

1178
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:41,520
Do you know what my suitcase contains?

1179
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,520
How would I know?

1180
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:46,360
My last possession.
Stacks of blank wedding cards

1181
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,840
Just give me a caption,
I shall get them printed

1182
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,800
Why suddenly a wedding card?

1183
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,800
Why?

1184
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,720
“Guru of Advert
Marries Lady Tremble-Heart”

1185
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,440
How is the caption

1186
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:04,520
Don’t act smart. See you in the afternoon

1187
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,640
Here, have it when you want

1188
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,440
Please return me my colored eggs, Doctor

1189
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,440
What do you mean?

1190
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:09,240
I mean you have given me
such black tablets

1191
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:12,160
The hen is only laying black eggs

1192
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:15,520
Only crows will be hatched

1193
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,560
Please Doctor, return my colored eggs to me

1194
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,560
When do you see these dreams?

1195
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,600
People only dream in sleep

1196
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,840
We also have waking reveries

1197
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,720
Since you are dreaming in sleep

1198
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,800
I am referring you to Dr. Addy

1199
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:39,000
He will analyze your dreams

1200
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,400
His chamber is in Chetla.
Give him my reference

1201
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:51,920
You are not going to treat me anymore?

1202
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,920
I came here because I had heard of you

1203
01:36:54,920 --> 01:37:00,080
You see him once. If needed, contact me.
You have my number

1204
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,720
Ok. See you then

1205
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:23,760
Any more patients? Send the next one

1206
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,400
You? That day you left in a hurry

1207
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,480
All your papers are with me

1208
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,840
I have a responsibility

1209
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,240
Anyway, how are you?

1210
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,880
Can you write now?

1211
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,400
You have hit the headlines
with the head injury

1212
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:05,280
I got back my pen after that

1213
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:11,160
And after your ‘identical twin’ visited me,
I am writing with new vigour

1214
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,240
Well, then she should
treat you

1215
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,200
You can try that. Interesting

1216
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,120
What? Direct insult?

1217
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:20,200
It’s not that

1218
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:26,160
I am impressed by you as a doctor...

1219
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:31,000
But your disguise was very poor

1220
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,000
What do you mean?

1221
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,400
Wait. There is more

1222
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:37,600
Abanti gave Srabanti a sealed packet

1223
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,240
Asked her not to open it

1224
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:45,000
But Srabanti rattled
off the list of contents

1225
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,760
From a doctor, I expected a little more

1226
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,040
I do not know what you think

1227
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:56,000
I had thought of this disguise because

1228
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,480
Even if you do not come to me regularly

1229
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:03,320
Living alone is not good for you,
so some supervision

1230
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,640
That is why

1231
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:09,920
After all other doctors had given up hope,
Doctor Bipula Mallick saved Nanda’s life

1232
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Who are they? I did not get that book list

1233
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,800
Why? Parashuram. Name of the story:
The Medical Crisis

1234
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,600
But that story ended in marriage

1235
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:28,640
Marriage? As a doctor Because
there was a reason

1236
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:33,960
Forget the reason factor

1237
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:38,280
You have taught me to write for
myself without any reason

1238
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:48,160
Just say, my bleeding face in the newspaper
made you come to see me

1239
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,520
What can be a greater reason than that?

1240
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:59,200
Anyway, you are a fantastic doctor

1241
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,360
How was that proved?

1242
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:08,800
After I hurt myself in the slum
and you came to see me...

1243
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,680
I have started writing my
own thoughts and words

1244
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:14,200
What are you writing Dear?

1245
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,280
Sorry, Sir?

1246
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,280
Ok, ok, Dear?

1247
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,400
Homeland Bengal

1248
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,480
A Nonsense History
of Bengal and Bengalees

1249
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:54,360
Hookah faced rascal
Homeland: Bengal

1250
01:40:55,200 --> 01:41:01,640
Hookah faced rascal
Homeland: Bengal

1251
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:07,520
Who has asked him,
“Don’t smile, be grim”?

1252
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:14,000
Shall we never know
Why he is so?

1253
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:24,640
In the recent past
Poems in rhyme he cast

1254
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:32,120
His lips bore the touch
Of early moustache

1255
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:39,040
Old boys’ club
At the local pub

1256
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:48,440
Drinking to the lees
Munching chickpeas

1257
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,960
Then for a few days
Chinese red haze

1258
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:59,040
Shared double half
Red Book, coffee cup

1259
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:06,360
Very soon State-God
Shoved a lethal rod

1260
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:14,240
Police bullets’ lead
Revolution lay dead

1261
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,880
Mainline lefties
With their hefties

1262
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:43,160
Came to limelight
Enjoyed great might

1263
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:52,800
Fell from great height
lost the poll fight...

1264
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:09,600
Red lost to the Green
Very culture-keen

1265
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:17,800
Playing Tagore songs
At crossings all day long

1266
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,560
On the other hand Now the Bangla Band

1267
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:32,400
Belting Beatle hits
Audience in fits!

1268
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:41,160
In this long walk,
Shunning native talk

1269
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:44,800
Bengal lost its idiom

1270
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,240
Bengali all wrong
We shall speak 'Bong'

1271
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:53,320
English is our medium

1272
01:43:53,320 --> 01:44:09,320
Hookah faced rascal
Homeland: Bengal
