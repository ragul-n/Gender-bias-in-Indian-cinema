For the sins that I've committed, if
death is the solution, you may take it.

00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,272
But he should remain alive!

10
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:42,604
He should remain alive for the sake
of his mother, who is waiting for him!

11
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:46,078
To adorn the throne of 'Mahishmathi'
he should remain alive!

12
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:50,739
'Mahendra Bahubali' must be alive!

you go and save that child.

Give the baby, give.
Hey fellow, who is this?

17
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,475
Don't know, on seeing the
bangle in the mother's hand...

18
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,670
...looks like she is a princess.

19
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,213
During the moment of death,
the finger was pointed towards mountain!

20
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:14,573
My God, two corpses are lying here.

21
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,243
Fellow, you are these people?
Looks like they had come to kill her.

22
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,175
It seems, that lady
had killed these people.

23
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,478
Hey chief!

24
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,706
My heavens! A cave, was not
aware of such a thing over here.

25
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:39,079
Hey chief! They are steps
inside this oneto climb up.

26
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42,512
That lady after giving the baby
and pointing to mountains.

27
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,104
Does it mean that he will
be taken towards sky?

28
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:48,215
Are you out ofyour mind? Has
send men to slain a new born baby.

29
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,973
Saying sending towards sky.
Ganga, it's not like that. I...

30
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:55,609
He is my son. As I was in deep pain
for not being able to bear children.

31
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,111
He is a blessing that this
'mother river' has given to me.

00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:02,147
If at all anyone's talks opposing
I'll pluck out that tongue and throw!

you doing here?

Mother, what is there on top?

37
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,475
Out there, there is ghosts and
devils, all sort of things like that.

38
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,274
If you go there, you will
be torn into pieces!

39
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm going to climb on top. - My God,
always saying the same thing, come!

40
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,505
How many times have I told,
not to climb that mountain?

41
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,409
Why are you repeatedly
climbing that mountain?

42
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,276
Aren't you my dear son, again you
must not climb, did you hear?

43
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,512
Hey man, it seems this time
he'll climb. -Where to climb!

44
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,776
Did you see that 'neermala' (mountain)?
It's somewhere in the sky.

45
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,138
While climbing on that
how many times he had fallen?

46
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,506
Hundred times!

47
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,581
Then what? Just like before
he'll fall down for sure.

48
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:53,580
Hey man, Shiva, overthere
your mother is doing something.

49
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,243
Shiva, Shiva!

may be your prayers will bear results.

53
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:13,047
Swamy!(tutor) lfl do this does
my son listen to what I say?

54
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,204
Will he stop climbing that mountain?

55
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,110
By all means, what have you
thought of Lord Shiva?

56
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,975
You surrender your soul
to Shiva and cool that deity.

57
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,411
Perhaps your son
may come to right path.

58
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,570
All right Swamy.

59
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,139
Mother, do you think that you
are young? - Move away boy!

60
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,406
Always if you climb up and
down won't you be ill?

61
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,178
My dear mother,
just listen to what I say.

62
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,577
Go man, have you ever
listened to my words?

63
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,674
Father, you may
advise her something.

64
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,671
Ganga!
What is it?

65
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,274
Where did you keep that 'Vibhuti'?
(sacred ash) where and all I searched.

66
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,066
Leave me boy! - Mother, then
I'll go instead of mother.

67
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,138
Did you agree?
That's not possible.

68
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,106
Shiva won't accept that.

69
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,611

themselves should fulfill it.

Agreed?

That's not possible,
Shiva won't accept that.

themselves should fulfill it.

77

For mother's hunger, is
it possible when son feeds?

Shiva will slain my mother!

just the way you predicted.

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,179
Ever since last
'Amavasi'(new moon)-

101
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:07,077
- my son has not paid attention
to that 'Neerm ala'(mountain)

102
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,046
Then what? What have
you thought of Shiva?

103
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:17,741
However, he is always talking to
that mask, which fell from 'Shiva Linga'

104
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,302
Why is that?

105
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:24,375
Who knows? How can I
know what Shiva may offer'?

106
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:27,411
That should be asked to Shiva, is it?
Swamy, I've a doubt.

107
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:31,070
Our Shiva has poured water
on top of 'Linga'(symbol)

108

So, will Parameshwaran (Shiva)
hear his prayers or her prayers?

109
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,678
This tongue will be
struck by a thunder bolt!

My son has done it for me, no?

that will take place.

you look at this wooden face?

How did you get this?

136
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,104
One person among you was caught
when he trespassed to our country.

Our men had killed him, this
was..This was on his neck.

138

I'm not the one who
killed him. No, don't kill me.

leaving behind any clues.

succumbed to victorious death.

142
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:51,076
Stop it. From the eyes
a drop of tears shouldn't fall.

143

Our 'beacon of clan' is
locked up in iron chains.

tied up like slaughter cows.

146

Our respect is
belittled and humiliated.

It is being hanged
with the head down.

148

eyes the fire should burn.

the pledge that is done?

Chief, won't forget that
till the life ends.

Even if thunder bolt
strikes on paths of our goal.

152

Never will desist from the
path, the absolute truth!

release of Devasena.

No time for smiles and laughter.

relationships and love.

The life is for Devasena.

Chief, we've heard several tales of
great warrior Kattappa of Mahishmathi.

163
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,071
What I have come to know is,
he is a good person.

164
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,441
Why don't we approach him?

165
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:38,674
'Karikala Kattapanakar' is
a very generous person.

166
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,712
He owns a high spirit.

167
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,406
But he will not do it.

168
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:50,108
Kattappa, is a slave of the throne.

169
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,074
<i>Karrappa!</i>

170
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:06,037
From the North, the arms
trader has come to meet you.

171
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:15,744
Asmnma 213mm.“

172
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,973
The iron taken from Bagdad tunnel.

173
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,405
Purified at Turkey.

174
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:24,747
Designed by Persian experts.

175
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,174
Double headed sword.

176
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:34,675
Ifthis sword is swinged by a kid
even the palm tree will be chopped off.

177
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,246
Very impressive sword!

178
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,349
But kindly pardon dearAslam, this
sword can't replace our swiftness.

179
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:08,541
Kattappa, when blood and word
falls out, it can't be taken back.

180
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:12,547
If your swiftness is
higherthan my sword.

181
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,038
Prove and show!

182
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,409
Now, did you
understand, Kattappa?

183
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,248
I've traveled a lot to countries
like China, Persia, Mongolia.

184
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,476
But I've never seen a
warrior like you, anywhere.

185
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,038
It is a pride forthis
Aslam to dine with you.

186
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,676
Come Kattappa!
Pardon Aslamji.

187
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,239
Slaves sitting along with
royal family is never acceptable.

188
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,004
Slave!

189
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,477
The head of this army.

190
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,408
You, a slave?
Yes Aslamji.

191
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,439
Before the war, weapons
should be made ready.

192
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:40,639
During the time of war, to save
the king's life must sacrifice life.

193
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,737
Afterthe war must lie down
under the feet of the king.

194
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:51,742
Tell, to release you ask your king
how much gold he wants? Ask and tell.

195
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,213
Higher than that in 10, 50,100
times, tell him Aslam will free you.

196
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,405
Aslamji, this slave
doesn't posses a price.

197
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,046
Everybody who is born in my caste.

198
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:05,239
Shall be the slaves
of Mahishmathi throne.

199
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,646
My ancestors at some point of
time, had already promised.

200
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:11,478
On a promise that is given by
dead people at some point of time.

201
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:15,074
Do you still have to"? -Let the
people who gave the promise die.

202
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,545
But the promised word doesn't die!

203
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,377
In this birth, my life and soul
is dedicated to Mahishmathi.

204
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,547
If the trust has a
form, that is you Kattappa

205
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:30,580
Whenever you need any
help at any time

206
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:34,210
Don't forget this dear friend
is always there to help you

207
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:43,167
asmnma 213mm.“

208
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:00,443
Wshau!

209
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,442
Where are you going?
Aren't you sleeping?

210
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:05,568
I'll come now.

211
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,710
We've received a golden
opportunity to fulfill our goal.

212
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,269
On the forth coming
day of 'Chathurthi'

213
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,040
Preparations had started to
celebrate the Palvaldeva's birthday -

214
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,979
- on a grand scale through
out the country

215
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,412
All the people in the country will
arrive to participate in the function

216
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:09,381
This is the righttime to bring
queen Devasena, the pride in it

217
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:12,641
Send me, send me!
I'm ready.

218
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,644
This time I give
chance to Avanthika

219
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,638
Avanthika, what is this?

220
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,404
How did this appear?

221
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:42,638
Your heart forgot the goal and went
in search of beauty, that is why.

222
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:48,207
A girl who loves her own beauty,
how can she fight for the goal?

223
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,542
You are not deserving
forthis title. I say you go!

224
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,411
Do not find this tear drop
as a symbol of weakness!

225
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:08,744
It has not sprouted
out of timidness.

226
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,372
The revenge in my heart
gets boiled and becomes vapor.

227
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:15,971
They are the fire balls
ejected out through the eyes.

228
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,444
Ifthe heat of that has touched you.

229
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:23,004
Please permit me for
the journey of my goal.

230
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,673
Now within two days you
should get ready to start.

231
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,440
You must execute the
things in utmost attention.

232
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,637
If you execute it carelessly,
you may end up in danger.

233
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,074
That Bhalvaldevan will tear
you apart and kill you!

234
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:49,267
Asmnma 213mm.“

235
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,742
Highness, that she-buffalo was brought
from woods, two days back only

236
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,446
Still now it is not calm.
Kindly be careful

237
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:08,375
Hey great minister, to defeat
Bhalvaldeva not one...

238
00:44:08,434 --> 00:44:11,643
...not one she-buffalo, may
require ten wild she-buffalos

239
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:13,473
You just come here

240
00:45:15,434 --> 00:45:17,004
Kill Bhalva...

241
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,042
Grandpa.

242
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:47,173
Long live great king!

243
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:51,439
Long live Bhalvaldevan!

244
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,208
Hey father, has killed it.

245
00:46:33,267 --> 00:46:36,271
Did you see the courage
of my father, did you see?

246
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:45,210
Asmnma 213mm.“

247
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:50,045
When I see your trust,
I always feel amazed, Kattappa.

248
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:58,618
Within your inner soul, I can
find the fire burning to kill me.

249
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:04,106
But still you gave your
life and saved me.

250
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,644
How is it Kattappa, how
could you do this?

251
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,672
Well, you may ask
whatever boon you want.

252
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,773
Will give anything you want.

253
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:24,072
Highness, I've got only one request.

254
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:28,279
End that punishment which that
mother is suffering for 25 years.

255
00:47:29,434 --> 00:47:31,209
Kindly free Devasena

256
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,012
Well, I here by give my word

257
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:45,610
Go and kill Devasena and free her!

258
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:51,642
Kattappa, is there higher
liberation than death?

259
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:53,242
Go!

260
00:47:55,767 --> 00:48:00,045
Does it mean no? If so let her suffer!

261
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,107
Should suffertill the last breath!

262
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:36,644
What lady? Are you sleeping?

263
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:40,347
Hey get UP!

264
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,578
Get up I 58V!

265
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:54,446
Aren't you done with sleeping?
Why are sleeping un-conscious?

266
00:48:54,734 --> 00:48:57,715
Get up.
Get up and come out.

267
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:34,273
Devasena, is there any
short falls in torture?

268
00:49:37,134 --> 00:49:38,545
Says doesn't want me.

269
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,705
Only wants him.

270
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:42,769
Now where is he?

271
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,575
Where is he? Let me hear.

272
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:48,574
Devasena, ifl ask one
thing you must tell thetruth.

273
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,010
During these past years, does
anyone from any where...

274
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,310
...at any time, have you
heard telling about him?

275
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,073
In any one ofthe nights,
in any one ofthe loneliness.

276
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:09,246
On the tickle of this
chain, that lives with you.

277
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:11,576
Have you heard his name?

278
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,010
Shucks!

279
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,403
No!

280
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,580
Devasena, Mahishmathi
has forgotten it

281
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:24,237
His name not only
from the lips of citizens...

282
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:26,410
...have vanished from theirthoughts

283
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,679
Now in this country there are only
two people who thinking about him

284
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:35,073
You..And me!

285
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,106
For you, in this birth longs
to see one more time

286
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:45,214
For me, Iwant to slain him one
more time till my anger vents out!

287
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:49,578
Both are unfulfilled wishes

288
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:09,444
Mother Devasena!

289
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:16,110
Kindly agreethis time, if you order

290
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,472
I'm ready to free you
from these chains

291
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,581
Have you decided to be in this
imprisonment through out the life?

292
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:31,614
No Kattappa, my son will come here

293
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:34,077
To free me

294
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:38,507
How can the son come
back, who is dead?

295
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,407
My son is alive

296
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,236
He'll return for me

297
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:49,105
For a son who is not alive,
still now you are waiting

298
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,679
Also undergoing a punishment
that was not at all required

299
00:52:53,334 --> 00:52:56,042
I don't know when I'll
get a chance like this

300
00:52:57,134 --> 00:53:01,173
Before the night guards reach
here, kindly accept princess

301
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:04,111
Please allow

302
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,076
I'm only asking a permission
for the liberation

303
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:10,713
At that time how is it possible, when
you pick up the twigs like this!

304
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,646
Kattappa, did you think that I'm a
mere lunatic that picks up twigs?

305
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:32,409
I'm preparing a 'fire bed'

306
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,549
To burn that Bhalvaldeva's
blood, body and soul

307
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,580
I'm preparing a fire bed forthat

308
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:55,106
My son will come here, he will come
and drag Bhalvaldeva into this fire bed

309
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:58,545
Will give that animal
into my hands to burn

310
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,571
Out of fear of death,
Bhalvaldeva's withering cry of pain...

311
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:06,410
...that will be echoed in the
walls of the fort of Mahishmathi

312
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:10,272
My son will come back for me

313
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:23,115
asmnma 213mm.“

314
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,002
Avanthika, what had happened?

315
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:28,411
On that day while I was
sleeping, drew on my hands

316
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,741
Again ifl sleep
here, he'll come again

317
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:22,047
Avanthika, what is this
on your shoulders?

318
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,480
Avanthi! - You go I'll come.

319
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:04,080
Did you see what I've drawn
on the shoulders? Isn't it good?

320
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:08,514
Why is always your face scorn?
Can't you just smile?

321
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,173
Hey why are you shooting arrows
on me? Are you trying to kill me?

322
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,476
Who are you?

323
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,376
It's nice to hear you
talk like this. I'm Shiva.

324
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:35,245
I hail from Am bili village, I've come to
top climbing mountain to see you

325
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:08,479
This is what I said,
should obey to words

326
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,978
Now did you see
unnecessarily fell into the hole

327
00:58:11,267 --> 00:58:12,143
How is it?

328
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:17,103
Avanth ika!

329
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:28,675
Now tell, who are you?

330
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:31,440
What I told is true, I climbed
that mountain and... - Stop it!

331
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:34,509
Only Paramashivan can climb that

332
00:58:34,634 --> 00:58:36,580
That is it, I'm Shivan is it?

333
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:38,507
Oh, no, no!

334
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,177
Enough, I'll tell everything

335
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:49,117
I'll tell everything but before
that I need to know one thing

336
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:51,745
What do you want to know?
Who are you?

337
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:55,644
Who are you?

338
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:06,415
Knife in the hand, shields in the
body, red eyes, a face glowing in anger

339
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,377
Not you what is seen outside.

340
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:11,040
Innerto that, at the
bottom of the mind

341
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,643
Truly, who are you?

342
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,411
Shall I say?

343
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,780
You are a female and I'm a male

344
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,573
I've come, liking you

345
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:11,674
Yes, how blissful is this pain

346
01:02:21,234 --> 01:02:25,705
This is mine. It was lost
in the mountain brooke

347
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:34,310
You..Have you actually climbed the
mountains and come on top? - Yes

348
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:36,975
This far'?

349
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:41,673
I've come here to see
the smile ofthis masked girl

350
01:02:44,267 --> 01:02:46,178
But still now I was not able to see it

became one very soon"

354
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:28,134
"Out of burning rock, haven't
you craved a heavenly beauty?"

355
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,179
"You are the star in
the sky and earth"

356
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:43,307

that came to my hands"

conquered mountains and reached here"

"Upon your arrival, I came to
realize that I have a heart"

362
01:04:45,267 --> 01:04:48,680
"Heart is throbbing,
telling your name"

120 feet golden statue

A luck which even
God has not achieved

371
01:06:03,134 --> 01:06:03,578
Yes, yes

372
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:08,742
After installation of this, the
fame of our king not only here...

373

...that will be spread
all over the universe

Is all the arrangements over'?

Highness, everything is completed

376

Tomorrow, the statue will be installed

Bahubali, highness don't kill me

383
01:09:14,634 --> 01:09:17,581
Pardon me, don't kill me
Please leave me

Shiva!

385
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,640
Shiva, kindly pardon me.
I didn't know what else to do

386
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:04,705
Can't deny you

387
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:08,709
For you my goal also...
You are mine Avanthika

Whatever you own,
that belongs to me

389

Even your goal is also mine

390

I don't know who that Devasena is
But it is her liberation that you wish

391
01:12:32,434 --> 01:12:34,072
I'll liberate her and bring

392
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:37,309
This is my promise

due to wounds in heart"

down, my son has come!

400
01:14:41,467 --> 01:14:43,743
Fast, make it fast

401
01:14:56,334 --> 01:14:57,074
Fast!

402
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:37,347
While installing king's
statue, all must praise him

403
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,537
While installing king's
statue, all must praise him

404
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,580
Nothing is going to happen

405
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,407
It's a hundred feet statue, no?

406
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,478
At least should sacrifice
hundred heads, no?

407
01:17:46,234 --> 01:17:47,235
Bahubali!

408
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:51,710
Bahubali?
Bahubali

409
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,178
Bahubali!

410
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:58,711
Bahubali!
Bahubali!

411
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:04,379
Bahubali!
Bahubali!

412
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,970
Who is that?

413
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,509
Bahubali!

414
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:57,638
Bahubali!
Bahubali!

415
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,137
Chinna, you also come and pull

416
01:20:56,367 --> 01:21:00,679
It has been 15 days since my son
has left, why is he not coming yet?

417
01:21:00,767 --> 01:21:03,577
He is the one who lifts the Shiva
Lingam, nothing will happen to him

418
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:06,739
If nothing has happened, why is he
not coming here? -Don't know...

419
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,575
...Whether he has seen his parents

420
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:11,043
Don't know whether he came
to know we are not his parents

421
01:21:11,134 --> 01:21:12,306
Won't my Shiva come back to here?

422
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,074
Ganga! - Here after won't
he call me mother?

423
01:21:14,134 --> 01:21:15,704
Hey fellows, open that cave fast

424
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:31,076
Come man

425
01:21:39,467 --> 01:21:42,607
On that day trusted me on
seeing the fire burning in my eyes

426
01:21:43,234 --> 01:21:46,545
Today on those same eyes, trust
on the determination that glares

427
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:50,148
My Shiva will liberate
queen Devasena

428
01:21:50,334 --> 01:21:51,540
Come with me

429
01:21:54,401 --> 01:21:55,004
<i>O</i> Kay

430
01:22:08,501 --> 01:22:12,313
Who has told that custodian of
righteousness Bahubali is not alive?

431
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:22,080
All though I'm alive
I'm dead long back

432
01:22:24,234 --> 01:22:27,579
And you, still keeps on living
in the minds ofthe people

433
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,472
Bahubali!
Bahubali!

434
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:43,177
On hearing the sound of Bahubali
still echoing in the breeze again

435
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:47,713
Not mine, it feels like
his statue is rising up

436
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:51,641
Is it because what that is suppressed
in the mind of people, has it come out?

437
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,538
Or is it because what is seen
in reality, has it come out?

438
01:22:56,367 --> 01:22:58,438
Shucks! No chance at all

439
01:22:59,301 --> 01:23:01,440
Will call all the guards

440
01:23:02,134 --> 01:23:04,205
Grandpa, will enquire who
has started it first

441
01:23:09,301 --> 01:23:14,301
asmnma 213mm.“

442
01:23:44,101 --> 01:23:47,571
Hey what are you doing
here, king is calling, come

443
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:03,745
Today who has pronounced the
sound Bahubali among the crowd?

444
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:12,710
The question is asked to you people
Why are you all silent?

445
01:24:13,267 --> 01:24:14,746
Your tongue, should
it be chopped off?

446
01:24:15,001 --> 01:24:17,743
Your highness, we do
not know who he is

447
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:18,638
Stop it!

448
01:24:21,267 --> 01:24:23,679
Bunch of donkies, are you saying
none among you has seen?

449
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,574
I've seen

450
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:16,736
It seems like I've seen
those eyes some where

451
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:20,978
Badhra, Iwant him alive

452
01:25:21,234 --> 01:25:22,508
All of you come

453
01:25:36,434 --> 01:25:37,742
Hey! Who are you man?

454
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,202
He is over here!
Catch him!

455
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:33,644
Catch him!

456
01:27:31,067 --> 01:27:32,546
Blow the danger siren!

457
01:27:49,234 --> 01:27:51,305
Mother, I've come to liberate you

458
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:56,044
Kattappa, one stranger has
entered inside the king's palace

459
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,579
He had escaped by
setting fire to kingdom

460
01:27:57,634 --> 01:27:59,204
You all go to the East

461
01:28:18,401 --> 01:28:21,610
I want him alive, doesn't matter if
legs and hands are broken - As you wish

462
01:28:21,767 --> 01:28:23,576
Somehow, want him alive

463
01:28:26,234 --> 01:28:27,144
Come

464
01:28:35,534 --> 01:28:37,241
Heard the danger siren!

465
01:30:03,334 --> 01:30:08,334
Asmnma 213mm.“

466
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,514
Did you think that
you had escaped?

467
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:00,303
You old lady!

468
01:31:00,534 --> 01:31:03,777
After all these years of punishment
aren't you done with sexual desire?

469
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,514
At the moment on seeing a male,
longs to flirt without shame isn't it?

470
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:21,309
Kattappa, save me, he
is going to kill me

471
01:32:21,434 --> 01:32:25,041
Young prince, indeed that is my duty

472
01:32:27,767 --> 01:32:33,581
If he wants to touch you,
before that he should defeat me

473
01:33:40,501 --> 01:33:41,445
<i>Karrappa!</i>

474
01:33:55,434 --> 01:33:56,674
Devasena!

475
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,110
They are coming to catch
Devasena, attack together

476
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:02,203
Bahubali!

477
01:38:13,134 --> 01:38:18,134
Asmnma 213mm.“

478
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,444
Thinking that he is
dead, you had raised him

479
01:38:31,634 --> 01:38:35,138
Made him into a great warrior,
presented to us and strengthened ourtrust

480
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,481
Towards you, this Mahishmathi
is always indebted

481
01:38:55,001 --> 01:38:57,538
My mother's eyes which
should gaze at me with love

482
01:38:59,134 --> 01:39:00,738
She looks at me
with a sorrowed face

483
01:39:04,334 --> 01:39:08,214
Those eyes which I had not seen
so far now looks at me as if I'm God

484
01:39:10,567 --> 01:39:15,414
Not knowing who she is, on seeing
those un-healed wounds on that mother

485
01:39:17,134 --> 01:39:19,740
My anger is burning!

486
01:39:21,067 --> 01:39:25,516
Why is that?
Who am I?

487
01:39:28,034 --> 01:39:33,074
You arethe blood of
our God Amarendra Bahubali

488
01:39:34,801 --> 01:39:39,546
You are blessing as a result of your
mother Devasena 25 years of penance

489
01:39:42,301 --> 01:39:44,679
You are a tree which is sprouted
out of seeds of 'sacrifice' -

490
01:39:44,767 --> 01:39:47,338
...of mother princess Shivagamidevi

491
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,746
Mahendra, the history
which you should...

492
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,007
...know has started
half a century back

493
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:55,439
The throne of Mahishmathi was
adorned by your grand father...

494
01:39:55,534 --> 01:39:57,514
...Veerendra Vikrama Devan

495
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:01,379
King's brother Pingaladeva,
was denied with the throne...

496
01:40:01,434 --> 01:40:03,539
...dueto his handicap
in his own mind

497
01:40:04,201 --> 01:40:07,739
Moreover he misunderstood that it
was because of his defect on his arm

498
01:40:08,001 --> 01:40:10,538
He glazed out of anger!

499
01:40:12,734 --> 01:40:16,100
By disdaining the citizen's of Mahishmathi
whom he loved so much

500
01:40:16,101 --> 01:40:19,139
Disdaining his wife who
was six months pregnant

501
01:40:19,267 --> 01:40:23,238
One day great king Veerendra
Vikrama Devan passed away

502
01:40:23,301 --> 01:40:26,214
For three months, the
Mahishmathi was drenched in sorrow

503
01:40:26,301 --> 01:40:29,373
Sister of king as well
as wife of Pingala...

504
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:33,710
...Shivagamidevi undertook the great
task of ruling on her own shoulders

505
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:37,247
With her knowledge
and dexterity, Mahishmathi...

506
01:40:37,334 --> 01:40:39,143
...was awarded with
a good governance

507
01:40:39,267 --> 01:40:41,440
However the throne without a king...

508
01:40:41,534 --> 01:40:45,038
...she soon realized it was
a breeding ground for cheaters

509
01:40:45,134 --> 01:40:49,241
Wicked people's cunning
moves echoed on her ears

510
01:40:49,801 --> 01:40:52,145
During the full moon at
'Kalkidakam' (July-August)

511
01:40:52,267 --> 01:40:54,577
The princess withered
out of labor pain

512
01:41:02,101 --> 01:41:04,138
Couldn't save the great princess

513
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:10,111
The baby is a boy

514
01:41:35,367 --> 01:41:37,244
Bahubali!

515
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:47,371
While seeing this throne, it seems
like it's a widow's forehead, isn't it?

516
01:41:47,567 --> 01:41:50,275
I'm going to take over this throne

517
01:41:50,467 --> 01:41:53,277
Bringing light to Mahishmathi,
which is remaining in darkness

518
01:41:53,401 --> 01:41:54,573
Indeed an apt decision

519
01:41:54,667 --> 01:41:59,480
You had taken pledge will remain
with Mahishmathi at all times, didn't you?

520
01:42:00,367 --> 01:42:05,077
At the times of a danger it is not
fair to be against country's interest...

521
01:42:05,234 --> 01:42:07,737
...that is not the symbol of a
'Kshatriya'(Warrior), Marthanda

522
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,241
Great minister, sign of a
'Kshatriya' is to conquer the throne

523
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,102
Shivagamidevi!

524
01:42:43,767 --> 01:42:48,079
Believers of royal family
come and stand on my side

525
01:42:48,334 --> 01:42:50,974
Hey Shivagamidevi, who is
going to align behind a lady?

526
01:43:02,401 --> 01:43:03,379
Kattappa...!

527
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:13,738
Because of them, honor of
Mahishmathi is tinged with shame

528
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:16,439
Purify itwith blood!

529
01:43:25,101 --> 01:43:28,480
Hey! Did you all see,
he is attacking our men?

530
01:43:32,001 --> 01:43:36,381
Go, slain that slave
and this Shivagami!

531
01:43:37,601 --> 01:43:39,308
<i>Kill Kattappa!</i>

532
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,573
With my own men, stabbing
on my back is it?

533
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:01,610
What a wild strategy of war'?

534
01:44:04,767 --> 01:44:06,747
Marthanda, this is not
a wild strategy of war

535
01:44:07,667 --> 01:44:09,408
This is the war strategy of the nation

536
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:28,741
Mother, have seen your knowledge
and courage face to face

537
01:44:29,067 --> 01:44:32,412
You must head this
throne and rule the nation

538
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:36,172
No, great minister
that is not my place

539
01:44:36,301 --> 01:44:39,248
Who else is it? -Great minister,
that is an unwanted question

540
01:44:39,634 --> 01:44:43,411
My son, Bhallaladeva is
born for this throne

541
01:44:43,534 --> 01:44:45,445
Shivagami, kindly
order the decree

542
01:45:04,734 --> 01:45:08,580
Both my children has got the
equal rights to head the throne

543
01:45:09,567 --> 01:45:13,379
When they grow up, out of them
one who is stronger in combat...

544
01:45:13,467 --> 01:45:15,674
...one who understands the
feelings of subjects more.

545
01:45:16,434 --> 01:45:19,005
He'll be the king of Mahishmathi

546
01:45:21,134 --> 01:45:24,240
This is my order and this is
the decree ofthe country also

547
01:45:29,467 --> 01:45:34,075
"On the sky as darkness spreads"

548
01:45:36,034 --> 01:45:39,607
"She is the ray of light"

549
01:45:41,467 --> 01:45:43,743
"On this lap..."

550
01:45:47,601 --> 01:45:51,481
"Bahubali was born here"

551
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:01,512
asmnma 213mm.“

552
01:46:02,201 --> 01:46:06,513
"Churns on this sea of milk"

553
01:46:09,234 --> 01:46:13,410
"ls it the poison orthe nectar?"

554
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:32,648
"To heirthe Mahishmathi
which leaps to skies"

555
01:46:33,134 --> 01:46:36,343
"Bahubali is that sun"

556
01:46:41,001 --> 01:46:48,476
"Adorns arms and garland
Bahubali is winning hero"

557
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:58,112
Feed me some

558
01:47:01,634 --> 01:47:03,671
Why standing? Kindly sit

559
01:47:07,401 --> 01:47:08,744
Now, you may feed me

560
01:47:09,201 --> 01:47:11,977
Prince, your visit to
here itself is wrong

561
01:47:12,101 --> 01:47:14,274
And sitting beside us,
that is a bigger offence

562
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,543
To quench hunger asked some food,
forthatwhy telling all this rules?

563
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:21,977
Over there at the palace,
royal feast is waiting for you

564
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,774
Let it be, what'll happen ifl eat this?

565
01:47:25,167 --> 01:47:27,443
The very smell of it,
makes me long to eat it

566
01:47:27,801 --> 01:47:30,213
Prince, even now haven't you
understood what the mistake is?

567
01:47:30,801 --> 01:47:32,576
You hail from royal family

568
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,279
We are from lower caste

569
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:38,776
If so, I being the prince of
Mahishmathi orders it

570
01:47:41,067 --> 01:47:42,546
Uncle, kindly feed me

571
01:49:03,667 --> 01:49:04,702
G reat!

572
01:49:16,701 --> 01:49:22,379
Great! When I become the
king, you'll be my army chief

573
01:49:46,367 --> 01:49:50,076
Complete training on education
and war techniques are over

574
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,079
Both of your children are
equally skilled, princess

575
01:49:53,234 --> 01:49:57,114
In such a situation how to
decide who'll be the future king?

576
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,673
I'm putting my children to a test

577
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:07,381
On the contrary, both of them are
equally blessed and Lord tests me

578
01:50:08,034 --> 01:50:12,449
Chief minister, let the next round
of tests be more severe than this

579
01:50:24,767 --> 01:50:27,145
Before deciding who'll
become the king

580
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:30,170
Princess, had to
confront a new problem

581
01:50:30,634 --> 01:50:34,047
In the form of Shahithan, who was
one of the most trusted one of princess

582
01:50:36,801 --> 01:50:40,715
Princess, a robber killed our guards
and stole our war strategies

583
01:50:43,334 --> 01:50:45,610
Inform the news to two young prince
As your order

584
01:50:45,767 --> 01:50:48,577
Both young princes, rode outside
the borders of Mahishmathi Kingdom.

585
01:50:48,667 --> 01:50:51,443
Traveled to various countries
in search of insurgent

586
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,638
At last came to know that he is
hiding in a place called 'Shringapuram'

587
01:50:55,267 --> 01:50:58,407
That place was the hiding
place for robbers and terrorists

588
01:50:58,601 --> 01:51:02,447
lf at all any strangers enters to that
place, impossible to return alive

589
01:51:15,267 --> 01:51:16,712
You are not seen here before

590
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,211
I'm new to this place

591
01:51:18,301 --> 01:51:21,339
Why do you want a knife
in the waist, are you an informer?

592
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:22,174
No, no

593
01:51:26,267 --> 01:51:28,042
Check everyone and
only then let them inside

594
01:51:28,267 --> 01:51:30,247
If our men had guarded like this...

595
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:32,710
We wouldn't be able to
see these countries

596
01:51:36,267 --> 01:51:39,373
Is it strength or intelligence?
Will use whichever is sharp

597
01:51:47,234 --> 01:51:48,372
Take the spirits

598
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:56,738
This is not enough

599
01:52:05,734 --> 01:52:07,213
This is also not enough

600
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:17,043
Do you have the money?

601
01:52:25,601 --> 01:52:28,138
Give as much as my brothers need

602
01:52:57,301 --> 01:52:59,542
Not only this there are several more

611

came in search of it"

"Body drenched in sugarcanejuice"

615
01:55:05,734 --> 01:55:11,207
"Haven't we made
flowers out of clouds?"

616
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:15,974
"Why searching for other ones?"

617
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:23,677
"Why not pluck the
flowers and tickle it?"

618
01:55:29,534 --> 01:55:35,416
"Magical charm of him"

619
01:55:35,601 --> 01:55:41,608

<i>Karrappa!</i>

629

Tell!

630
01:58:41,767 --> 01:58:44,077
To whom have you
send the secrets?

631
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,401
Come on tell

632
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:48,080
<i>Kalakeya</i>

633
01:58:50,434 --> 01:58:53,040
Kalakeyar, they are like hunters

634
01:58:53,734 --> 01:58:56,180
Once they trespass inside a city...

635
01:58:56,267 --> 01:58:59,043
...they will come and search for crying
babies and squeeze their necks

636
01:59:00,034 --> 01:59:04,107
They rape females without any
distinction on youth and old

637
01:59:04,634 --> 01:59:06,477
Will kill whatever that has got life

638
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,071
Whatever that shines
will be possessed by them

639
01:59:09,434 --> 01:59:11,436
And the restwill be put to flames

640
01:59:12,667 --> 01:59:15,238
Small countries might
be scared of Kalakeyan

641
01:59:15,634 --> 01:59:19,138
Why should we get scared,
as we've 25,000 soldiers?

642
01:59:20,234 --> 01:59:22,407
What is the strength
of the Kalakeya army?

643
01:59:23,667 --> 01:59:25,078
100,000!

644
02:00:01,167 --> 02:00:06,446
Woods where herd of locust flies
land where Kalakeya army moves

645
02:00:06,567 --> 02:00:08,137
That will be converted
into a burial ground

646
02:00:17,501 --> 02:00:21,108
On one side we should protect
the country and on other side...

647
02:00:21,234 --> 02:00:22,679
...we must continue the war

648
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,707
What is ourwar strategy?

649
02:00:26,267 --> 02:00:27,610
'Trident military array'

650
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:35,310
That strategy is only in the books
No one has tried it

651
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:38,078
Do you mean to say with
philosophy can go for war?

652
02:00:38,334 --> 02:00:42,077
If no one knows it,
then Kalakeyar also won't know it

653
02:00:42,267 --> 02:00:44,372
Because of that we
should use that one

654
02:00:45,167 --> 02:00:46,703
That is my opinion

655
02:00:47,634 --> 02:00:49,079
I agree to it

656
02:00:49,501 --> 02:00:53,313
To come inside our country
this is the only entrance

657
02:00:53,634 --> 02:00:55,739
Kattappa, to keep offthe enemies...

658
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:58,474
...not entering how many
soldiers do you want?

659
02:00:59,801 --> 02:01:05,444
5000 soldiers, with spears and
shields will create an iron fort

660
02:01:06,167 --> 02:01:08,113
A big wall made up of soldiers

661
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:13,705
I'll take the charge of
the army at the North

662
02:01:16,234 --> 02:01:17,770
I'll undertake the army at the South

663
02:01:19,568 --> 02:01:21,605
From the information
what we have received

664
02:01:22,134 --> 02:01:26,082
Kalakeya army head will deploy
only half of his army to forefront

665
02:01:26,434 --> 02:01:29,347
With our military array and
with other weapons...

666
02:01:29,601 --> 02:01:34,050
...any big army can be
detained forten hours

667
02:01:34,634 --> 02:01:38,104
But before that
Kalakeya head must be killed

668
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:42,543
When the army head is killed, the
army will get scattered and run

669
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:45,239
At the middle of the war,
at the right time

670
02:01:45,667 --> 02:01:48,238
Both the princes, along
with horse army battalion...

671
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:50,576
<i>...will attack Kalakeya head</i>

672
02:01:50,634 --> 02:01:53,581
On understanding this
military array and to counter...

673
02:01:53,634 --> 02:01:56,740
...attack they might need two hours

674
02:01:57,034 --> 02:01:59,605
Mother, that is enough for
me to succeed and return

675
02:01:59,734 --> 02:02:03,341
For me, just one hour will be
enough to chop his head and return

676
02:02:03,434 --> 02:02:07,280
Great! One who wins in
this will get thethrone

677
02:02:07,601 --> 02:02:13,142
In the war who kills the Kalakeya
head, he'll get Mahishmathi throne

678
02:02:13,667 --> 02:02:16,580
That is true highness
Yes

679
02:02:20,568 --> 02:02:24,482
For both ofthe princes,
divide the army and give

680
02:02:26,167 --> 02:02:30,707
Bhalva, Bahu time has
given a good opportunity...

681
02:02:30,767 --> 02:02:33,577
...to show your love
towards your country

682
02:02:34,167 --> 02:02:35,339
Make use of it

683
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:39,572
Long live Mahishmathi Kingdom!

684
02:02:43,734 --> 02:02:46,715
Bahu, what your uncle has
done towards you is injustice

685
02:02:47,367 --> 02:02:50,712
You are given with only weapons
to destroy the wall ofthe fort

686
02:02:51,534 --> 02:02:54,242
On a wide war front what
is the use of that?

687
02:02:56,134 --> 02:02:58,705
All weapons on arrow shooting
is delegated to Bhalvaldevan

688
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:03,645
Shucks!
You could have denied that initially

689
02:03:07,467 --> 02:03:12,541
Giving the arrow shooting tools
to our prince that was big cheating

690
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:16,739
What cheating? I need this much
soldiers, these many weapons...

691
02:03:16,801 --> 02:03:19,281
...one who is not capable of
demanding by asking, over here

692
02:03:19,534 --> 02:03:22,071
What is he going to
do at the war field?

693
02:03:22,401 --> 02:03:25,405
A strong person is
provided with more strength

694
02:03:26,667 --> 02:03:30,080
This is not cheating, this is
the strategy of war in the country

695
02:03:31,167 --> 02:03:33,613
Hey who is that?
Kindly excuse

696
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,546
Prince has told to dismantle
the tents and come

697
02:04:45,434 --> 02:04:47,539
Bhalvaldeva, welcome!

698
02:05:23,367 --> 02:05:25,347
Bahubali welcome!

699
02:05:28,767 --> 02:05:32,544
Bahubali!
Bahubali!

700
02:05:50,468 --> 02:05:51,606
No need!

701
02:05:57,034 --> 02:06:00,413
Bahu, this is a ritual that is
followed by us for centuries

702
02:06:00,534 --> 02:06:02,707
When the sacrifice is not conducted
the soldiers will get frightened

703
02:06:02,767 --> 02:06:04,371
Their confidence will get swinged

704
02:06:05,434 --> 02:06:07,107
The blood must be spilled!

705
02:06:07,234 --> 02:06:10,010
Yes prince, if sacrifice
is not done before the war...

706
02:06:10,067 --> 02:06:11,569
...will become a victim of Kali's wrath

707
02:06:11,701 --> 02:06:13,237
To quench the thirst of Kali...

708
02:06:13,301 --> 02:06:15,008
...why an animal sacrifice, that
doesn't know anything?

709
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:18,104
Let my blood be
spilled, which is boiling

710
02:06:20,734 --> 02:06:25,740
Long live Mahishmathi Kingdom!

711
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,741
There is a limit to
Mahishmathi's patience

712
02:06:48,301 --> 02:06:50,247
Giving you a chance for
the last and final time

713
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:52,075
Leave yourweapons in
the battle field and return...

714
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:53,475
...you can be spared from killing

715
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,771
Among the two children
of yours, one who kills me

716
02:07:11,067 --> 02:07:13,069
You had informed that he is the king

717
02:07:19,267 --> 02:07:21,679
Perhaps ifthey die in my hands

718
02:07:39,201 --> 02:07:41,738
Along with the country
I'll also attack you

719
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,638
I'm ready to give you a son!

720
02:07:43,734 --> 02:07:45,145
You make him the king!

721
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,211
He should be there, alive!

722
02:07:56,734 --> 02:08:01,183
Today before sun set, legs
and hands chopped off...

723
02:08:01,234 --> 02:08:04,238
...on the battle field, with blood
flowing he should be alive!

724
02:08:10,267 --> 02:08:15,239
For the vultures to pluck out his
eyes, eagles to dig out his intestines...

725
02:08:16,201 --> 02:08:18,272
...he should very much remain alive!

726
02:08:19,734 --> 02:08:21,441
Kattappa!
As peryour order

727
02:08:21,767 --> 02:08:23,678
Let the war sirens blow!

728
02:10:07,467 --> 02:10:12,467
Asmnma 213mm.“

729
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:35,080
Long live Bahubali!

730
02:16:52,601 --> 02:16:54,444
Start trident military array

731
02:19:30,734 --> 02:19:32,111
Bhalvaldevan!

732
02:19:38,067 --> 02:19:38,772
Young prince!

733
02:19:50,633 --> 02:19:51,475
Young prince!

734
02:19:51,567 --> 02:19:52,375
Soldiers!

735
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:19,100
Asmnma 213mm.“

736
02:22:22,300 --> 02:22:24,109
Our military array is destroyed

737
02:22:24,334 --> 02:22:27,406
Forthefirst time, in the soil of
Mahishmathi enemy flag is flying

738
02:22:27,567 --> 02:22:29,478
This is the sign of death

739
02:22:29,667 --> 02:22:30,771
Truly, it's death!

740
02:22:31,067 --> 02:22:31,772
Death!

741
02:22:32,767 --> 02:22:33,677
Death!

742
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:24,671
Death!

743
02:23:28,467 --> 02:23:29,537
Death!

744
02:23:33,267 --> 02:23:34,769
Brave men!

745
02:23:42,634 --> 02:23:44,307
What is death?

746
02:23:45,601 --> 02:23:49,242
More than our strength, thinking
that number of enemies are more...

747
02:23:49,334 --> 02:23:50,312
...that's death

748
02:23:54,067 --> 02:23:58,072
In the battle field, it's better to die
than living in fear, that is death!

749
02:23:59,667 --> 02:24:04,241
After insulting mother and person
laughs before the eyes, on seeing it...

750
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:11,750
In stead of chopping his head,
fleeing out of fright, that is death!

751
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:19,579
To win that death, I'm
going to start my journey

752
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:24,475
My mother as well as my motherland,
no one who is born to a scoundrel...

753
02:24:24,567 --> 02:24:29,744
...can'tjust touch them!
I'll prove this by killing enemies

754
02:24:35,233 --> 02:24:37,440
Who is going to come with me?

755
02:24:39,467 --> 02:24:41,208
I'm the one...!

756
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:43,746
Who is ready to die with me?

757
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:44,744
I'm the one...!

758
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:48,009
Who is going to succeed
death and live with me?

759
02:24:48,167 --> 02:24:49,373
I'm the one...!

760
02:24:51,267 --> 02:24:52,302
I'm the one...!

761
02:24:52,733 --> 02:24:56,738
Long live Mahishmathi!

762
02:24:57,734 --> 02:25:00,408
Long live Mahishmathi!

763
02:25:12,201 --> 02:25:14,010
Long live Mahishmathi!

764
02:25:15,367 --> 02:25:18,507
Long live Mahishmathi!

765
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:39,546
Vultures must pluck out his eyes!

766
02:30:40,033 --> 02:30:42,377
Eagles must dig out his intestines

767
02:30:42,667 --> 02:30:44,613
With legs and hands chopped off

768
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:46,473
A river of blood should flow!

769
02:31:12,267 --> 02:31:15,373
Yes, my son, mine...!

770
02:31:15,534 --> 02:31:19,209
Let Bhalvaldeva rule!

771
02:31:27,433 --> 02:31:32,433
Asmnma 213mm.“

772
02:31:41,734 --> 02:31:42,576
My Son!

773
02:31:44,433 --> 02:31:45,639
My blood!

774
02:31:46,234 --> 02:31:48,680
My son killed Kalakeyan!

775
02:31:49,434 --> 02:31:51,004
Won the battle!

776
02:31:55,767 --> 02:31:59,738
From now on the king of
Mahishmathi is Bhalvaldevan

777
02:32:00,067 --> 02:32:03,241
Long live Bhalvaldevan

778
02:32:04,434 --> 02:32:05,777
The courage of Bhalvaldevan...

779
02:32:06,267 --> 02:32:09,578
...should be written in
golden letters in history

780
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:13,773
This success epic should be
scripted on our temple walls

781
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:19,108
Afterthousands of years, let his
tale of success sung by this soil!

782
02:32:19,433 --> 02:32:23,040
Today, my son Bhalvaldevan
great warrior...

783
02:32:23,134 --> 02:32:25,774
...is appointed as
army chief of Mahishmathi

784
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:33,177
And I hereby inform, Bahubali
as your future king!

785
02:32:41,300 --> 02:32:44,645
Hey Shivagami, what
a decision is this?

786
02:32:45,001 --> 02:32:45,741
My Son!

787
02:32:47,334 --> 02:32:48,540
Our son!

788
02:32:48,634 --> 02:32:51,171
It was our son, no?
Who killed Kalakeyan

789
02:32:51,234 --> 02:32:52,713
And haven't you seen that?

790
02:32:53,633 --> 02:32:55,579
Why is he not appointed as king?

791
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:57,108
Why...?

792
02:32:57,634 --> 02:33:00,046
The qualification to become
the king is not on account...

793
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:01,374
...of how many enemies he killed

794
02:33:01,733 --> 02:33:04,236
It is based on how
many citizens he had saved

795
02:33:05,634 --> 02:33:09,343
In the battle field Bhalvaldeva's
focus was on killing foes

796
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:13,976
On the other hand, Bahubali, has
slained enemies with one hand

797
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:16,410
With the other hand
he saved our citizens

798
02:33:17,267 --> 02:33:20,441
That is the difference
between a warrior and a king

799
02:33:22,633 --> 02:33:25,341
One who kills hundred enemies
is indeed a courageous warrior

800
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:28,546
Being able to save one life

801
02:33:28,667 --> 02:33:30,271
He is equal to God

802
02:33:34,267 --> 02:33:37,214
If anyone saves lower castes,
that to become a king...

803
02:33:37,267 --> 02:33:39,304
Bahubali, will become
the king of Mahishmathi...

804
02:33:39,367 --> 02:33:41,404
...on an auspicious time,
he'll adorn the crown!

805
02:33:42,567 --> 02:33:44,069
This is my final order!

806
02:33:44,134 --> 02:33:46,444
This is my order and my
proclamation for the country

807
02:33:49,234 --> 02:33:51,680
Bahubali!
Bahubali!

808
02:33:52,334 --> 02:33:57,113
Bahubali!
Bahubali!

809
02:34:19,601 --> 02:34:22,013
Immortal Bahubali!

810
02:34:30,433 --> 02:34:33,778
Immortal Bahubali!

811
02:34:43,267 --> 02:34:47,079
Was my Shivan's father,
such a great valiant?

812
02:34:47,634 --> 02:34:50,581
On hearing about
him I get goosebumps!

813
02:34:51,267 --> 02:34:53,144
Can I see him once?

814
02:34:55,667 --> 02:34:56,737
No mother

815
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:01,002
That God demised

816
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:12,038
No weapons can touch,
no foe can come near!

817
02:35:13,401 --> 02:35:15,972
Can you tell how that
brave warrior died?

818
02:35:17,067 --> 02:35:19,707
There is a deadly weapon
than ordinary weapons

819
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,411
Treacherous killing!

820
02:35:23,601 --> 02:35:25,638
Bahubali, was stabbed from back

821
02:35:26,567 --> 02:35:29,241
Who is that?
Who is that cheat?

822
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:34,077
That cheater...

823
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:37,974
...l'm the one!

824
02:35:55,434 --> 02:36:00,434
"Dearest dream which is
inflicted with violence in soul..."

825
02:36:08,767 --> 02:36:13,767
"...on one's lap it is
carried, that is life"

826
02:36:21,201 --> 02:36:31,111
"Confronted with dense
woods as proceeded fonlvard"

827
02:36:31,567 --> 02:36:36,567
"Challenging great paths of destiny"

828
02:36:51,434 --> 02:36:54,434
"My beloved is on the march to
succeed for a cherished victory"
