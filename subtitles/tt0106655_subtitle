00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,329
'There is a higher court
than courts of justice...

2
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:26,838
...and that is the court
of conscience.

3
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:29,866
It supersedes all
other courts. '

4
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:36,249
Our film, Damini, is based on
*this statement by Mahatma Gandhi.

5
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:32,448
No! No!

6
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,320
No!

7
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,941
Go!

8
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:20,168
No! No! No!

9
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,433
No!

10
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:29,875
What happened?

11
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,413
Are you scared?

12
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:41,758
Why do you feel scared here?

13
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,162
Huh?

14
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:50,931
What happened?

15
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:55,170
Nobody's here. Why?
- They've gone home.

16
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,643
Yes, they've all gone home.

17
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:04,742
You want to go home? - Yes.

18
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:06,408
With whom?

19
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:10,382
Mother.

20
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:11,717
Mother won't come.

21
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,453
She said they won't
take you home.

22
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:20,264
Why have they brought you here?

23
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:26,538
Tell me. Why have they
brought you here?

24
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:32,343
They say I'm not well.

25
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:35,874
I'm alright.

26
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:39,781
What alright? Why do you have
color on your hands?

27
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,117
Huh? What's all this?

28
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:47,316
I didn't. They...

29
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:51,694
I'm hurt too.

30
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,198
Where do you stay?

31
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,208
Don't remember, right?

32
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,151
I know... - Know what?

33
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:20,189
I'll tell you tomorrow. - Why
tomorrow? Tell me now!

34
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,793
It's very far. - What?

35
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,527
It's very far.

36
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:32,431
It's far? Okay, okay.

37
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,731
Prepare for shocks.

38
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,166
Where are you taking me, Dilip?

39
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:38,704
Let's go to the hotel. We'll
discuss the board meeting.

40
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,239
That'll be done. I've
prepared for it.

41
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:42,638
Come. The show will start.
*-What's there in Nasik? What show?

42
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,202
I know you've seen big
shows in Mumbai.

43
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:46,404
You've seen the world.

44
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,471
But if you see the dance here,
you'll be stunned. - Come on.

45
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:13,500
I swing without my beloved...

46
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:17,065
...how do I forget my promise?

47
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:23,547
I swing without my beloved...

48
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:26,107
...how do I forget my promise?

49
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:31,547
I feel like flying and
touching the sky.

50
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,226
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.

51
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:46,467
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.

52
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:52,444
My love, I've got
you in my heart.

53
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,376
I swing without my beloved...

54
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:59,418
...how do I forget my promise?

55
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,739
I've suffered for many years.

56
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:29,179
Don't torment me anymore.

57
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:34,186
These distances say, hug me.

58
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:44,356
These eyes yearned for you.

59
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,129
You don't know dear, how my
days and nights passed.

60
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:52,103
The flowers have become young.

61
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,537
The weather is lovely.

62
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:59,135
They've brought a new
life, don't go.

63
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:03,681
I swing without my beloved...

64
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,583
...how do I forget my promise?

65
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,383
I swing without my beloved...

66
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:14,119
...how do I forget my promise?

67
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:19,256
I feel like flying and
touching the sky.

68
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:26,670
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.

69
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:32,473
My love, I've got
you in my heart.

70
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,407
I swing without my beloved...

71
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:39,474
...how do I forget my promise?

72
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:06,378
My heart has craves for
your love every moment.

73
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:11,176
My dream destination
is far away, still.

74
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,583
My heart has craves for
your love every moment.

75
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:26,724
My dream destination
is far away, still.

76
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:32,235
I'm so Ionely. I am a
friend of memories.

77
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:37,368
I'm now a riddle. Come to me.

78
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:44,412
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.

79
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:51,754
I've come with wings, bringing
the monsoon along.

80
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:57,262
My love, I've got
you in my heart.

81
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:01,490
I swing without my beloved...

82
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,331
...how do I forget my promise?

83
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:10,138
I feel like flying and
touching the sky.

84
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,374
Wow! What a dance!

85
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:47,134
Nice dance, wasn't it? - What a
*girl! What a dancer! What a dance!

86
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:50,546
And Amir? - He was good.
But she was... wow!

87
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,818
Let's do this. Let's meet
and congratulate her.

88
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:55,853
Come on, that discussion...
- What meeting?

89
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,620
Congratulating a new artiste
increases their confidence.

90
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:00,818
You come with me. Come on.

91
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,690
Amir sir, thanks a lot.

92
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,856
You spared time from
your busy schedule.

93
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,262
You came to this school's
charity program.

94
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,163
Look. - We're really
grateful to you.

95
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:12,362
I'm grateful to you, that
you gave me this chance.

96
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,168
We work daily for ourselves.

97
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:19,435
But when we get a chance to
work for charity show...

98
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:20,804
...it feels good.

99
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:23,479
One feels at peace. - It's
your greatness.

100
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,408
Thanks a lot, Amir.

101
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,816
Due to your presence,
the show was great.

102
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,185
Otherwise KT and I... - No,
what are you saying?

103
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:32,281
You were the life of the show.

104
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,784
You dance very well.

105
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,694
In fact, an artiste like you
should be in the film industry.

106
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,731
Yes. - Lf you say, I
can recommend you.

107
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:45,365
Films? No.

108
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:48,865
I won't be able to act.

109
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,702
I manage to do what my
teacher taught me...

110
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:54,677
...after a lot of scolding.

111
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,280
Even then, I make mistakes.

112
00:13:56,782 --> 00:14:00,616
And when I get a chance, I take
*part in charity shows like these.

113
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:04,250
I'm happy with this.

114
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:06,516
That's how she is.

115
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,089
She's good. She's
good as she is.

116
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,653
Please come. - Sure.

117
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:15,257
Don't you know how to talk?
- What else should I have said?

118
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,460
The dance was good, right?

119
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,094
I swing without my beloved...

120
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:20,571
Amir, congratulations!
- Thank you. Hello.

121
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,199
Meet him. Mr. Shekhar Gupta.
- Hello. - Hello.

122
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:24,334
Owner of Gupta and Sons.

123
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,435
You did a great job. - Thank you.

124
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,104
I'm your ardent fan.

125
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,906
I've seen your 'Dil' (film),
22 times. - Ok.

126
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,816
When is your 'Andaz Apna
Apna' releasing?

127
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:34,147
It'll come very soon.

128
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,380
Please make it soon. - Yes.

129
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:36,546
Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.

130
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,180
Mr. Gupta, bye-bye.

131
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:40,324
Bye-bye. See how...

132
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,329
This happens because
of you. - Me?

133
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,595
Of course. You just
keep chattering.

134
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,296
I keep chattering? - Then do I?

135
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,167
Yes, you do it. - You do it.

136
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:55,231
Okay, I do it.

137
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,774
Devika! - Oh, Birju.

138
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:01,838
Devika! Is it set? Our
affair. - What is set?

139
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:05,149
Not to you. I'm talking to...
- Why do ask repeatedly?

140
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,348
Didn't I say once? - No,
I mean... - Enough!

141
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,411
I... shall I come... - What's he
saying? - Come. - What's set?

142
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,255
Shanti!

143
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:25,697
Dad... dad, Shanti...

144
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,633
Come child.

145
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,397
Children shouldn't
stay. Come on.

146
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:31,469
Come on.

147
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,539
Damini! Come on.

148
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,272
Come.

149
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,147
This is how girls are.

150
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:41,409
They should be married
before they mature.

151
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:43,920
What did Shanti want to prove
with this suicide?

152
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:45,688
Will she be disgraced
any less now?

153
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:47,719
The poor father.

154
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:49,224
He had met day before.

155
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,788
He was asking what to do.

156
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,325
He couldn't arrange for
money for dowry.

157
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,432
I say, no matter how
poor a father is...

158
00:15:56,502 --> 00:16:01,337
...he won't marry his daughter
off to a useless guy.

159
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:03,500
Whatever you say.

160
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,372
There are two young
daughters at home...

161
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,844
...and time is passing by. - As if
I don't understand anything!

162
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,681
I'm just twiddling my thumbs!

163
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,148
Only you're worried
about it, not me!

164
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:16,585
Ask anyone... - All I can do is
grovel at people's feet now!

165
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,250
There's dowry, relatives,
horoscope.

166
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,122
Aren't they important too?

167
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:22,751
Isn't checking the family
important too?

168
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:25,319
You just keep rattling
all the time!

169
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,764
I've said so many times.
Get poison for me!

170
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,869
I'll die! Just because
I am a mother!

171
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:34,163
Why should you die?
I should die!

172
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,265
I'm useless, right?

173
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:40,835
I sired daughters but couldn't
marry them off till now.

174
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:44,278
I'll lie down on the railway
tracks and end the story!

175
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,709
Run the house with my pension!

176
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,150
Marry your daughters off!

177
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,198
I'm going with Birju tonight.

178
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:07,271
With Birju? Where?

179
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,533
Mumbai.

180
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,340
His relative has
a factory there.

181
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:15,144
On going there we... - Are
you crazy, sister?

182
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,507
You got fooled by that
drunkard Birju?

183
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,407
What else does he do?

184
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,746
Lying, watching films, gambling.

185
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:27,190
But it's also possible that
he'll change after marriage.

186
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,253
I want to give life a chance,
Chhoti (little one).

187
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,160
Not a chance, you're punishing
it, sister.

188
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,425
It may be a punishment.

189
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,832
But by doing this father's
burden will be reduced.

190
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,571
I want to live, Chhoti.

191
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,201
Won't you help me?

192
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:47,675
But sister... - Please, Chhoti.

193
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:08,656
Write a letter, sister. - Yes.

194
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:30,355
She told you last night,
why didn't you tell me?

195
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:33,452
Sister hasn't done
anything wrong.

196
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,891
She has disgraced me
in the community!

197
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,594
What community are
you talking about?

198
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:38,593
Which one?

199
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:42,593
Has anyone from the community
come to our help so far?

200
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:46,261
Yes, one did. Your
Lakshmi Narayan.

201
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:49,408
Like a great sympathizer,
he came to marry sister.

202
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:52,536
He has two daughters
of sister's age.

203
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:55,745
Old, shameless man! Lecherous!

204
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,116
And that Ram Mohan.

205
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:01,214
He had got engaged to sister
in the community's presence.

206
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,554
And then he broke it. Why?

207
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,290
Just because of dowry.

208
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,225
Did anyone intervene?

209
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,850
You had pleaded so much.

210
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:12,726
Mother had even held his feet!

211
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,496
No one said anything.

212
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,634
Your community stood
and watched quietly!

213
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,633
Community!

214
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:24,142
You care for such lowly people
who can't do anything for us...

215
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,541
...who're not bothered about us!

216
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,472
This is what it is.

217
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:30,877
Caught in the mess of dowry,
*community, relatives, horoscope...

218
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,078
...the girl remains unmarried.

219
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:35,286
Whether she marries or not
is for me to bother about.

220
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:36,512
I'm the guardian of this house.

221
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,784
I understand everything. - Yes,
you understand everything!

222
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,892
You don't understand what
a girl goes through.

223
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,687
Shanti's father didn't
understand either.

224
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:48,700
That's why last night, Shanti...

225
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,566
Thank God, dad...

226
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:56,341
...sister did no such thing.

227
00:19:56,542 --> 00:20:00,342
Whatever your sister did,
she has ruined us!

228
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,413
She's dead for this
family from today!

229
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:05,581
Sister has gone to live, dad!

230
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,309
She wants to live.

231
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:10,651
And she will live!

232
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:21,691
Gupta Mills, Gupta Industries,
Gupta and Sons.

233
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:25,337
These are names which have
*carved a niche in the whole country.

234
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:27,262
It is great news for all of us...

235
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,737
...that Mr. Kedarnath Gupta's
elder son, Mr. Shekhar Gupta...

236
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,367
...is setting up another
project in Nasik.

237
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,138
Thank you. - A small gift
from all of us.

238
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:40,615
Thank you. Thank you. - Sir, I
wish you'd say a few words...

239
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:43,344
I... what do I say?

240
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:47,620
I'm sure that as usual, I'll get
your support in future too.

241
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,954
Actually, my family is linked
to this city since ages.

242
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:59,293
But now... now I feel a relation
is about to be established.

243
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:02,137
A deep relationship.

244
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,469
Hello, Shekhar. - Yes,
mom, tell me.

245
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,409
Where were you last evening?

246
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,846
Don't ask where I was
last evening...

247
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,907
...and what happened
with me, mom.

248
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,881
What's it, Shekhar,
are you alright?

249
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,281
I am but I'm not.

250
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:20,584
Mr. Bajaj is here.

251
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:21,853
Here, speak with him.

252
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,623
I couldn't speak with her, mom.

253
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:28,799
Pray that I meet her, speak with
her, then speak again...

254
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:30,664
...and keep speaking.

255
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:31,828
What happened? Disconnected?

256
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,428
It got disconnected. - I see.

257
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,564
Don't know why he
was blabbering.

258
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:39,839
When one doesn't marry at the
right time, one does falter.

259
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:42,346
Right, Gupta. - You're
experienced.

260
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,646
Look at him. He's younger
to Shekhar.

261
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,482
But since he's married,
he's so happy.

262
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:49,879
Uncle, you...

263
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,749
I say, get Shekhar married soon.

264
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:55,485
My daughter will handle
the rest. Right uncle?

265
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:59,156
Shekhar and Lucy are
made to order pair.

266
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:02,634
They'll marry and Gupta and
Bajaj will have made it!

267
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,703
What happened? What happened
to my daughter?

268
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,139
What happened? - Some
tea was spilt...

269
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,904
Insolent! You spill hot tea!

270
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,403
Get me some ice, please.

271
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:16,743
Ice! Get ice!

272
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,373
Why are you staring!
Throw her out!

273
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,644
Illiterate, fool!

274
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:23,914
Apply some ointment.
Some ointment.

275
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,288
Why are you staring, idiot? Go!

276
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,321
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
sister-in-law.

277
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:33,525
The thing is, I can't bear
something happening to Lucy.

278
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,157
She doesn't have a mother.

279
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:40,502
Now I only wish that she comes
here as a daughter-in-law.

280
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,920
Ever since I saw you, dear...

281
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:43,463
...I can't say how
restless I am.

282
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:47,565
Ever since I saw you, dear...

283
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:55,637
...I can't say how
restless I am.

284
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:59,547
Ever since I have
loved you, dear...

285
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:06,621
...I can't say how
restless I am.

286
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:31,748
At first glance, you've
cast such a spell...

287
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:36,914
...that I've lost my senses
and control on my heart.

288
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:46,194
At first glance, you've
cast such a spell...

289
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:51,134
...that I've lost my senses
and control on my heart.

290
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:57,501
I'm scared to think that...

291
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:02,203
...I might become
a crazy lover.

292
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,881
Ever since I've desired
you, dear...

293
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:15,150
...I can't sleep and
there's no peace.

294
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:18,830
Ever since I saw you, dear...

295
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:27,498
...I can't say how
restless I am.

296
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:15,644
You've stolen my sleep.

297
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:20,385
Restlessness torments
me a lot.

298
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:30,091
You've stolen my sleep.

299
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:34,832
Restlessness torments
me a lot.

300
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:46,209
When I think of you,
a pang is aroused.

301
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:51,222
Ever since I've
got you, dear...

302
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:59,288
...I dream day and night.

303
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:03,391
Ever since I have
loved you, dear...

304
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:10,169
...I can't say how
restless I am.

305
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:14,870
Ever since I saw you, dear...

306
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:23,283
...I can't say how
restless I am.

307
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:27,253
Ever since I have
loved you, dear...

308
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:35,863
...I can't say how
restless I am.

309
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,365
Brother.

310
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,238
Does Ms. Damini stay
here somewhere?

311
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:46,277
Damini... - There she is.

312
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,575
Where? - Why don't you
send him to school?

313
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:50,372
He's always sitting here.

314
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:53,213
He doesn't go, what do
I do? - Why doesn't he?

315
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:54,611
You don't go? You don't?

316
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,187
Here, madam. - How will you be
an officer without studying?

317
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:00,653
Send him to me, I'll
set him right.

318
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,125
Shall I give you a
kilo of sweets?

319
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,321
Yes, taste them. - No.

320
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:07,422
Made in pure clarified butter.
What happened to my daughter?

321
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:09,194
I'll give you a kilo
of sweet balls too.

322
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:13,431
Sir, people come from far
for Mewalal's sweets.

323
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:15,564
And they go straight to the
hospital on eating them!

324
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,108
Didn't the kids fall ill after
*eating the sweets last week? - Damini...

325
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:19,234
...what are you saying?

326
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:20,710
These were the ones.
- She's very naughty.

327
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,747
Six kids. - I'll tell
your father.

328
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:24,441
Are you spoiling my
business? - Yes.

329
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,507
And if you don't stop
this business...

330
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,075
...I'll put up a board outside.

331
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:30,314
Beware of Mewalal's
adulterated sweets.

332
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:32,653
I'm speaking the truth.
Only flies eat these.

333
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:34,419
Come, I'll show you a nice shop.

334
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:38,688
Damini! You'll see. One day,
*this truth will prove costly to you.

335
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,527
Is it a sin to speak
the truth? - What?

336
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:41,791
Tell me. - No.

337
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,358
No one speaks it.
Isn't it? - Yes.

338
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,461
There's something wrong
everywhere. Isn't there? - Yes.

339
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:47,903
Even then, everyone
is quiet. Please.

340
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,869
The priest at the temple
opposite our house...

341
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:55,611
...sells the coconut offered
there to the shop.

342
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,116
The same coconut is offered
and sold, offered and sold.

343
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:01,243
Offered and sold... - But
no one says anything.

344
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,514
Everyone is quiet. It just
goes on as it is.

345
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,419
And if I say something,
my sister scolds me.

346
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:07,649
Devika. - Devika.

347
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:09,091
She says I talk too much.

348
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:10,456
Do I speak a lot?

349
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:13,089
No, you don't talk
a lot. - That's it.

350
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:16,623
People here talk a lot, but
not where they should.

351
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,828
That's why all this is
happening. - What's happening?

352
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:21,668
Who are talking to? Who is he?

353
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:25,205
Dad... - Hello. - Yes,
I... he... sweets...

354
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:26,574
Mr. Pedhe? - No.

355
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,806
No, my name is Shekhar.
- Shekhar Pedhe.

356
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,371
No, Shekhar Gupta. My name
is Shekhar Gupta.

357
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,247
Is it? - Yes. - How
come you're here?

358
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:36,717
I... this Gupta Industries,
Gupta Mills... - Yes.

359
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:40,519
This Gupta Establishment... - That
is Mr. Kedarnath Gupta's. - Yes.

360
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:41,752
I'm his elder son.

361
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,795
Oh! - Yes.

362
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:50,496
I had come here for the
company's work and...

363
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,366
I had seen your show. - Really?

364
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:54,837
Yes. You dance beautifully.
Very beautiful.

365
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,204
I want to marry your daughter.

366
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,705
What? - Yes.

367
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:03,508
If you want, daddy
will talk to you.

368
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:05,375
Why he? I will...

369
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,747
But why do you want to marry?

370
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:12,256
What? - No... I mean why do
you want to marry me?

371
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:16,917
You don't even know me and
just now... then how did...

372
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:22,395
Ms. Damini, sometimes, even
*after ages, no relation is formed...

373
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:23,798
...and there's no acquaintance.

374
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:26,662
And sometimes, in one meeting,
one feels as if...

375
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:31,307
...one knows the other since
ages. Right? - Yes.

376
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:33,470
Don't you feel that?

377
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,747
A postmaster's daughter will
now be our daughter-in-law.

378
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:42,183
But you... just see
her once, mom.

379
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:45,382
Shut up! Relatives are already
wagging tongues.

380
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:49,183
The younger one is married, the
elder one still hasn't. - Yes.

381
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:53,892
People don't know that the young
one didn't get married.

382
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,527
He was forced to.

383
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,961
Since these two had
had fun in college.

384
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,705
In this situation, if we
hadn't accepted Deepa...

385
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:03,832
...her life would've been ruined.

386
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:06,708
But Deepa is the Agarwal
family's daughter.

387
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:08,646
She's not an ordinary
man's daughter.

388
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:11,477
Mom, Damini is from
a poor family...

389
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:14,311
...but her thoughts, her nature...

390
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:16,111
...she has a lot of virtues, mom.

391
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:17,655
A lot of virtues. - That's it?

392
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:21,223
You've understood everything
in one meeting? - Yes, mom.

393
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:24,922
My heart believes that Damini...
Damini is the one.

394
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:27,424
Mom, please. - Damini?

395
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,733
Is this a name? - Why?

396
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:37,542
Compare her to Mr. Bajaj's
daughter. Lucy! - Uncle!

397
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:38,735
Will you keep quiet now?

398
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,803
I think we should meet the girl.
- Oh thank you, dad. Thank you.

399
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:45,282
By the way, tell me
something. - What?

400
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,677
What's so special
about that girl?

401
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,650
Dad you...

402
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,753
Now that you're meeting
her, see for yourself.

403
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,818
Hurry up dear. They're waiting
since long. - Just a minute, mom.

404
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,691
Wow! This is a good set.

405
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:07,727
Yes. That's why mom said not
to pour very hot tea.

406
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:11,572
Or they'll break. They're 52
rupees a pair. - Are they?

407
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,736
Damini herself has made this.

408
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:15,177
Oh really? - Yes.

409
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:17,511
She's fond of these things
since childhood.

410
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:20,751
She's excellent at stitching,
embroidery, weaving.

411
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:24,812
And she's great at singing and
dancing. - Yes, we've seen that.

412
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:29,155
That's where he... no.

413
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:35,596
I was saying, I don't see
Damini's elder sister Devika.

414
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,361
Where's she?

415
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,627
Uncle! Uncle. - Uncle?

416
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:42,730
She has gone to her uncle's
house. She'll come. - I see.

417
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:46,768
If anyone asks about sister, say
she's at her uncle's place.

418
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:49,477
Don't talk too much.
You talk a lot.

419
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:52,940
Damini's mom! Bring Damini.

420
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:54,913
Come.

421
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:04,084
Damini. - This is very...

422
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,764
Greetings. - No greetings.

423
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,096
Touch his feet.

424
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:12,693
A father-in-law is greater
than the father. - No, no.

425
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,295
It's okay, sit.

426
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:16,205
This... - No.

427
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,103
Why? - No. - Okay.

428
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:19,835
Please have it.

429
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:21,270
Tea.

430
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,408
You have it. - No, you, please.

431
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:26,575
What?

432
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:28,812
She's Damini's mother.

433
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,149
Greetings. - Greetings.

434
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:31,688
Greetings. - Greetings.

435
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:37,455
Listen.

436
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:46,431
Before you decide, I want to
say something. - Go ahead.

437
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,842
My sister, Devika... - She has
gone to her uncle's place.

438
00:33:52,911 --> 00:34:00,511
No. She has gone to
Mumbai. With Birju.

439
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:03,345
Birju was our neighbor.

440
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:07,884
She'll marry him there. Careful.

441
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:11,626
It's 52 rupees a pair. They
belong to the neighbor.

442
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:21,203
You did well to tell us.

443
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,798
Otherwise these days, who...

444
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:26,401
This is what is special.

445
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:29,777
This won't change our decision.

446
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:34,214
Right, father? - What do I say?

447
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:38,618
Now, we'll call the priest
and fix a date.

448
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,588
Congratulations, sir.

449
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:47,590
Shekhar, congrats.

450
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,660
Congratulations!
Congratulations! - Bless you!

451
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,327
Congratulations to you too.

452
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:55,837
Thank you very much.

453
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,266
Get the mouth fast. - Mouth?!

454
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:00,436
Sweets to sweeten the mouth!

455
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,596
There are nine bangles
on my hands.

456
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:29,231
What are you doing among women?

457
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:32,174
You're supposed to be outside,
with the guests! Go!

458
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm needed everywhere. How
much can I manage? - Here.

459
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:40,613
This is Sita necklace. The
legacy of our family.

460
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:42,876
Now this necklace is yours.

461
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,648
Since you're the elder
daughter-in-law of this family.

462
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:48,487
It costs 900,000,
daughter-in-law. 900,000!

463
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,818
A rich family's rich gift!

464
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:53,159
Oh Sumitra! This is too much.

465
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:55,431
Nothing was given to the
younger daughter-in-law.

466
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,360
And so much for the elder
daughter-in-law!

467
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:00,461
What is this necklace for her?

468
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:03,139
She had brought two trunks
of gold with her.

469
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:04,803
But this poor one...

470
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:09,780
We're lucky that Shekhar
liked her.

471
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:13,249
Our Shekhar has been generous
since childhood.

472
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:14,576
Remember Sumitra?

473
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,119
He saw a kitten suffering
on the road...

474
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:19,415
...he brought it home
from the streets.

475
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,485
Why are you repeating
old tales, Damu?

476
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:26,358
I'm saying that our Shekhar
hasn't changed.

477
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:28,728
His childhood habit still
hasn't left him.

478
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:36,706
Greetings, madam.

479
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:42,709
Grandfather says, wearing a mark
wards off the evil eye.

480
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:45,749
You? - Urmi.

481
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,494
Dear, today you've got
everything due to your luck.

482
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,364
What else do I have to give?

483
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:09,369
I have... this.

484
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:11,268
Keep Her with you.

485
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:14,377
She will always protect
you. Yes.

486
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:21,718
Madam, what're you doing?

487
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,150
A new bride shouldn't
work so much.

488
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:26,584
You talk like a granny.

489
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,091
What about you who do
everything here...

490
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,820
...at such a young age?

491
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,693
So what? I work for my home.

492
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:35,161
Sister. - Leave me.

493
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:37,300
I'm making a spinach
vegetable for him.

494
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:43,097
It's a pleasure to feed your
husband yourself. - Oh really?

495
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:46,702
Damini! - Yes, uncle?

496
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:49,409
Embroider a pink rose on my
violet kurta (Iong shirt).

497
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:50,878
Sure. I'll do it.

498
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,878
Damini! - Yes, mummy?

499
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,349
There's my sari on the bed.
Send it to the laundry.

500
00:37:58,122 --> 00:37:59,851
Yes. I'll send the eggplant
to the laundry...

501
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,390
Quiet! I've to stitch a flower
and send the sari. - Damini!

502
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:07,587
Yes, mother? - We're going to
Mr. Gupta for veneration.

503
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,130
The whole family has
been invited.

504
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,631
Okay. I'll finish the work
and come with Deepa.

505
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:14,638
No, Deepa is also going with us.

506
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,069
You stay here. Help Urmi.

507
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,266
Some people are coming
for dinner.

508
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:22,074
Okay.

509
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,375
Come on. There's a lot of work.

510
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:26,608
We'll finish the work
and watch TV, okay?

511
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,485
It's a small injury Urmi.

512
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:33,289
Leave it, leave it. Never mind.

513
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:38,424
What's wrong with you?
- I don't know, madam.

514
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,893
When you get hurt,
I feel very sad.

515
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:47,701
Where are you, Damini? - What?

516
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,501
There's no one at home.
Where are you?

517
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:50,835
I'm upstairs.

518
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,378
Urmi. Will you prepare that?

519
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:56,905
I'll just come, okay?

520
00:38:57,315 --> 00:39:01,752
I've heard it's a pleasure
to feed one's husband.

521
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:04,245
Okay, okay. I'll cook it myself.

522
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:05,755
Only when he lets you, right?

523
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,215
What?

524
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,156
What did you say?

525
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,222
Take this! This!

526
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,331
You can't break this
partnership!

527
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:20,132
I'll lose billions!

528
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:22,138
It had already been decided.
- It was also decided that...

529
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:24,401
...Shekhar will marry
my daughter.

530
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:26,340
You can't link marriage
to business!

531
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,539
Everything is linked for
a businessman, Gupta!

532
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:33,080
Look, whatever has
happened has...

533
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:35,085
It has not happened yet!
It will happen now!

534
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,446
I've seen your rise, Gupta.

535
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:40,488
Now, in this city, I'll
see your downfall!

536
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,223
A loss of 150 million!

537
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,737
Sister. This loss is
only from Baroda.

538
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:58,536
Add 200 from Kolkatta
and it's 350 million!

539
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:01,668
Just 650 million short
of a billion.

540
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:05,810
But Shekhar and he didn't
tell me anything.

541
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:09,410
Who could they? This has
happened because of Damini.

542
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:13,214
This Bajaj has now
become an enemy.

543
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:15,756
Greetings. - Come,
come. Hats off!

544
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,285
What an entry! Wow!

545
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:20,159
They've come today
from Nasik. - Yes.

546
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:22,227
I've brought jackfruit for you.

547
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:25,263
It grew in our backyard.

548
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:28,403
Damini cooks it deliciously.
- Yes.

549
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,697
Here. - Sister.

550
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:34,403
Here. Jackfruit worth
350 million!

551
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:36,341
Now we'll have to eat
only this. Yes!

552
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:41,875
Damu. Arrange for tea and
breakfast for them.

553
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:44,246
I'm not well.

554
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:45,584
Ok.

555
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,690
What made you come here?

556
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:53,960
Now we've decided to stay here.

557
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:56,163
What? - Yes. I've seen a house.

558
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:59,327
It's far and small. But it's
okay for the two of us.

559
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:02,337
Why so far? Come here.

560
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:03,532
It's such a big house.

561
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,869
We'll find one room.

562
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:07,338
No, no.

563
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,275
We don't have even drink water...

564
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,814
...at her daughter's
in-laws' place.

565
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,149
It makes us indebted.
- Indebted?!

566
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:17,217
Sir, it's not so. Look at uncle.

567
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,856
He's stuck here since 20 years
like a Vindhyachal hill!

568
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,289
He hasn't moved! - Shut up!

569
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:23,321
Hold this! Hold the jackfruit.

570
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:24,720
Your kerchief. - Yes.

571
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:27,230
Arrange for some
snacks for them.

572
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:28,790
??
...

573
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,572
Dear. How are you?

574
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:40,371
I'm fine, dad.

575
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:45,746
Dad, look here. It's such a
nice view of the sea-shore.

576
00:41:46,384 --> 00:41:48,648
There's a lovely breeze
in the evening.

577
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,150
And the red flowers there.

578
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:54,686
I had never seen them in Nasik.

579
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:57,622
And there... - Dear...

580
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:59,396
How are you?

581
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:25,812
You all want to fly, right?

582
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,857
With your friends,
up in the sky!

583
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,763
Look. I'll quietly
open the door.

584
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:38,359
Escape without a noise. Okay?

585
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,799
Come on. Escape! Escape!

586
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:44,299
Escape!

587
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:45,839
Escape!

588
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:48,406
What's happening there?

589
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:50,810
No, nothing. Nothing.

590
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:53,749
What nothing? You're freeing the
birds and say, nothing!

591
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:56,749
I... I... - I what?

592
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,313
You know, these are
singing birds.

593
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:01,821
What? - Yes.

594
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:03,592
These birds sing.

595
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:07,389
Birds don't sing in
cages, they cry.

596
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:12,134
How do you feel here, Damini?

597
00:43:12,603 --> 00:43:14,161
I... - Yes.

598
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:18,308
I feel a bit scared.

599
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:24,612
I feel as if I don't
belong here.

600
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:29,912
I don't what you liked
about me that...

601
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:32,479
...you married without
knowing me.

602
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:40,593
I keep wondering what I should
do to keep you happy always.

603
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:46,531
You don't have to do anything.
You're good as you are.

604
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:53,402
I feel like making every wish
of yours my mission.

605
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,942
Your smile, your joy is
everything for me now.

606
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:06,851
I want to keep looking, keep
looking, keep looking... - Mother!

607
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:12,718
Imp! You scared me.

608
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,097
I'll show you in the evening.

609
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,297
And yes. Don't ever touch
this cage henceforth!

610
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:23,136
Never touch it! Set them
free now. - Really!

611
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:08,481
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

612
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,158
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

613
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:22,561
Of our union. Of
our craziness...

614
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:26,330
...these sights are witnesses.

615
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:31,706
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

616
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:39,414
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

617
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:46,485
Of our union. Of
our craziness...

618
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,924
...these sights are witnesses.

619
00:45:50,227 --> 00:45:55,722
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

620
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:29,463
I'll hold you in my heart.

621
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:32,559
You are my heartbeat.

622
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:36,671
I'll look at you morning
and evening.

623
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,198
You are my mirror.

624
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:47,783
I'll hold you in my heart.

625
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:50,878
You are my heartbeat.

626
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:55,222
I'll look at you morning
and evening.

627
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,920
You are my mirror.

628
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:05,835
I won't be able to
live separately.

629
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:11,736
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

630
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:18,814
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

631
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:26,353
Of our union. Of
our craziness...

632
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:29,859
...these sights are witnesses.

633
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:35,589
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

634
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:43,095
Damini! Damini! Damini!
Oh my Damini!

635
00:47:43,274 --> 00:47:50,180
Damini! Damini! Damini!
Oh my Damini!

636
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:35,189
I've forgotten this world
since I fell in love.

637
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:42,624
I don't ask for anything
else from my God.

638
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:53,505
I've forgotten this world
since I fell in love.

639
00:48:54,211 --> 00:49:00,480
I don't ask for anything
else from my God.

640
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:08,521
There are desires in heart
and a prayer on my lips.

641
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:14,495
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

642
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:21,664
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

643
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:28,509
Of our union. Of
our craziness...

644
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:32,705
...these sights are witnesses.

645
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:37,880
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

646
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:45,562
They're witnesses. The moon
and stars are witnesses.

647
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:52,635
Damini! Damini! Damini!
Oh my Damini!

648
00:49:53,103 --> 00:50:00,236
Damini! Damini! Damini!
Oh my Damini!

649
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:07,280
Damini! Damini! Damini!
I'm your Damini!

650
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:14,615
Damini! Damini! Damini!
I'm your Damini!

651
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:34,210
Damini!

652
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,943
No! Please! No!

653
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:39,741
Just a little! - Yes,
just a little!

654
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,416
A little here. A little
here. And here.

655
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:45,954
Best wishes on your first Holi
(festival of colors).

656
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:48,157
Now it's my turn! My turn!

657
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:49,749
Apply just a little!
Just a small mark.

658
00:50:49,893 --> 00:50:51,326
A little? Just a mark?

659
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:52,623
It shouldn't go in
the eyes. - Yes.

660
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,664
Hey! Don't!

661
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:58,359
Get lost! - Imp! I'll hit you!

662
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:05,330
No! No! Leave me! - It's
Holi! - It's Holi!

663
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:06,706
What's happening?

664
00:51:06,777 --> 00:51:09,143
When she's refusing why are you
forcefully applying color?

665
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:10,271
Go downstairs!

666
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:19,720
There's a lot of work
downstairs. Come soon.

667
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,690
Yes, madam. I'll just
come with the sweets.

668
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:23,790
Damini! Where are you?

669
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:25,260
They're yelling for
sweets there. - Yes.

670
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:26,762
You attend to them.
Give me this.

671
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,559
Go and get sweets. Go -Okay.

672
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:29,690
Yes, coming.

673
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,132
Urmi!

674
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,339
Urmi! - Madam!

675
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:39,641
Urmi! - Madam!

676
00:51:41,345 --> 00:51:43,404
Brutes! Leave her!

677
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,643
Madam! - Leave her! Leave her!

678
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:51,348
Beast! Leave her!
Leave her! - Move!

679
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:52,912
Leave her! - Madam!

680
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:57,827
Madam! Madam! Madam!??

681
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,388
Rakesh!

682
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,432
Shekhar! Shekhar!

683
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:14,409
Come down! - You come up!

684
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:16,170
Shekhar, listen to me!

685
00:52:33,464 --> 00:52:35,295
Shekhar, listen to me!

686
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,931
Shekhar! Rakesh and his friends
have taken Urmi upstairs!

687
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,762
Come fast! Anything
can happen there!

688
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,399
No! No!

689
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:49,746
No! No!

690
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:56,682
Rakesh! - No!

691
00:52:57,387 --> 00:53:00,151
Rakesh! - No!

692
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,520
Rakesh! Rakesh!

693
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:05,391
No!

694
00:53:05,863 --> 00:53:07,660
Shall I call father? - Shut up!

695
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:28,879
Rakesh! Rakesh!

696
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:30,646
They are... Damini!

697
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:32,447
Damini!

698
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:34,423
Give the car keys! - What
happened to Urmi?

699
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:36,584
Move! - Where are you taking her?

700
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,144
Come on!

701
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:06,754
Creep! Weren't you ashamed?

702
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:09,823
What're you doing? - You
raped her! - Shekhar!

703
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,190
I'll kill you! - Enough! Enough!

704
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:13,525
Will you kill him? - Yes,
I'll kill him!

705
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:15,121
That girl has grown up in
this house! - Shekhar!

706
00:54:15,198 --> 00:54:17,564
If she's a servant, doesn't
she have respect? - Shekhar!

707
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:19,602
Shekhar don't hit him,
please! - Enough!

708
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,297
You should be ashamed! - Shekhar!

709
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:22,698
Shekhar!

710
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:24,431
You take care of Damini.

711
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,668
I'll handle everything.
Go! Please!

712
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:27,869
Disgraceful!

713
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:32,579
I don't what I had done
that I got such a son!

714
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:34,784
Daddy, forgive me!

715
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:37,445
Listen, you go to your in-laws'
place for some days.

716
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:39,783
If someone asks, say you were
there for some days.

717
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:42,324
You had gone for Holi.
- Come now. - Get lost!

718
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:44,787
Dad... - Go! - Come on!

719
00:54:51,768 --> 00:54:53,531
Careful! Slowly!

720
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,134
Urmi! - Relax.

721
00:55:01,211 --> 00:55:02,473
How's Urmi? - Okay.

722
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:03,737
How are you?

723
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:06,541
Where is she?

724
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,345
She's fine. She has gone home.

725
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:15,758
How can she be fine? We should
go there quickly.

726
00:55:16,193 --> 00:55:19,185
She might need us. Might
need a doctor.

727
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,254
When she sees us,
she... - Damini...

728
00:55:21,431 --> 00:55:22,762
Damini, we can't go there.

729
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,458
Why?

730
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:29,100
There... Damini, it'll
be a police case.

731
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:33,470
So haven't you all informed
the police yet?

732
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:37,409
Police... it's Rakesh.

733
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:41,877
Sir, senior sir has called
you downstairs. - Okay.

734
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:43,279
The police are here.

735
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:45,781
Tell him I'm coming.

736
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:57,431
Damini, the police are here.
They could question you.

737
00:55:57,868 --> 00:56:00,200
Right now, just say you
haven't seen anything.

738
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:04,298
I'll explain later. Now you've to
*just say you haven't seen anything.

739
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:07,204
Say you were in the room.
You hadn't gone out.

740
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:08,437
You hadn't seen anything.

741
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:10,078
Don't forget.

742
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:17,279
I've already told you
that that girl Urmi...

743
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:19,549
...isn't coming to work
since last week.

744
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:23,587
She was caught stealing,
we threw her out.

745
00:56:24,194 --> 00:56:26,355
And what've we got to do with
what she does outside...

746
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,522
...or what happens with her?

747
00:56:27,597 --> 00:56:30,225
But Urmi has named your son
Rakesh her statement.

748
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,665
So what if she has named him?

749
00:56:31,735 --> 00:56:32,827
She was of loose character.

750
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:35,201
She must've gone with some
loafer... - Sumitra!

751
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:38,096
You keep quiet. - Brother-in-law.
Call up Delhi.

752
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:39,469
He'll be transferred right now.

753
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:40,908
Whom are you threatening?

754
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:43,744
A poor girl has been raped
in this house and you...

755
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:45,543
What rubbish are you talking?

756
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:48,482
This a decent family's
house, officer.

757
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:49,912
Mind your language.

758
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:52,121
Urmi has said everything
in her statement.

759
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:55,223
She has also said that Damini
has seen everything.

760
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:57,593
I want to meet Damini and
take her statement.

761
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:00,128
Damini is not well.

762
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:02,128
She hasn't come out of her
room since morning.

763
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:07,126
You... you come tomorrow and
ask her what you want.

764
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:10,332
Not tomorrow, now! - I said she
*can't meet you! - Look Mr. Shekhar!

765
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:15,401
Sumitra, get Damini downstairs.

766
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:25,845
Look dear. Even we're sad
about what happened.

767
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:30,483
But if this goes too far,
Rakesh's life will be ruined.

768
00:57:30,794 --> 00:57:33,319
He has a wife, kid.

769
00:57:34,131 --> 00:57:36,326
Answer the police
carefully, dear.

770
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:40,327
This family's respect
now depends on you.

771
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,309
Tell me Ms. Damini.

772
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:52,575
You've seen what happened
with Urmi.

773
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:56,711
Urmi has also said in her
*statement that you tried to help her.

774
00:57:57,354 --> 00:58:00,118
They raped her and threw
her in a gutter.

775
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:06,560
And now that poor girl is
fighting for life in a hospital.

776
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:10,629
Tell me, Ms. Damini.
Who were they?

777
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:15,833
If you speak the truth, Urmi
will get justice. Help her.

778
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:22,641
My husband must've told you.

779
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:26,108
I'm not well.

780
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:31,576
I was in my room all day today.

781
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:41,196
I don't know what you
are saying. - Lies!

782
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:42,526
You're lying!

783
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:45,123
Ms. Damini, speak the
truth for God's sake!

784
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:47,568
Speak the truth for Urmi's
sake! - You're speaking...

785
00:58:50,574 --> 00:58:52,166
Good night, officer.

786
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:57,546
Your lie will prove very
costly for Urmi.

787
00:59:06,122 --> 00:59:08,181
No, no I don't want
to hear anything!

788
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:10,524
You lied to me!

789
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:13,761
You had said Urmi was fine.

790
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:17,322
What could I do, Damini?
What could I do?

791
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,162
As it is, you're not well
and... - And Urmi?

792
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:22,436
Think about Urmi.

793
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:30,544
She's there and we... instead
of doing something for her...

794
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:33,072
...everyone is lying!

795
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,751
And you made me lie too! - Yes,
I made you lie! I did!

796
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:39,684
Because one truth from you
will ruin everything!

797
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:43,383
Look Damini! We have to
suppress this issue.

798
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:45,294
What? - Yes.

799
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:50,561
Rakesh is my brother. Brother!

800
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:53,659
It's about family.

801
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:57,898
How do we hand him over
to the police?

802
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:04,171
This police... who will do what...

803
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:06,748
We shouldn't think
about all this.

804
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:11,251
In front of us, Urmi was...

805
01:00:12,289 --> 01:00:15,622
We should just help her anyhow.

806
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:17,489
Why don't you understand,
Damini?

807
01:00:17,627 --> 01:00:19,424
This isn't the time
for emotions.

808
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:20,827
Be practical.

809
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:22,825
Look, if this issue flares up...

810
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:24,764
...Rakesh and his friends
will be punished.

811
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:28,270
But with it, the reputation of
four families will be ruined.

812
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:36,507
A girl who has served you all
*day and night is now in hospital.

813
01:00:36,813 --> 01:00:39,907
And you're talking about
families and reputation!

814
01:00:40,283 --> 01:00:43,411
Please Damini, please!
Understand.

815
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,952
Look, no one will be
harmed in anyway.

816
01:00:49,259 --> 01:00:52,353
Speaking the truth has
never harmed anybody.

817
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:54,354
And neither can it harm.

818
01:00:55,665 --> 01:00:57,462
Let's meet her now.

819
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:59,734
We'll take mother along too.

820
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,762
It'll be a great
support for her.

821
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:05,502
Seeing us will cheer Urmi.

822
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:11,875
Why can't we? Why can't we go?

823
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:15,510
I want to go. I'll meet Urmi.

824
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:18,219
Take me, will you? Take me.

825
01:01:26,162 --> 01:01:28,687
I want to meet Urmi.

826
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:31,199
She must be waiting for us.

827
01:01:31,835 --> 01:01:33,325
She must be waiting for me.

828
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:46,144
She was raped at the right time.

829
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:50,283
Now I will ruin the Gupta
clan's reputation.

830
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,821
The game of reputation
begins now.

831
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:06,733
I thought he'll save us from
ruin after hearing us.

832
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:09,738
But no, he's just playing.

833
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:15,769
Brother-in-law, listen to me.

834
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:17,340
Let's go to Jaunpur.

835
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:21,374
We did well to save
two acres of land.

836
01:02:21,818 --> 01:02:23,308
It has proved useful
during bad times.

837
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,485
Shut up, Damu!

838
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:29,916
Mr. Chadda. - Everything is done.

839
01:02:30,627 --> 01:02:37,931
Everything. Date, hearing
and sentence.

840
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:43,868
Mr. Gupta, the world
knows that when...

841
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:53,349
...case comes to barrister
*Chadda, it's date is fixed later.

842
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,746
The sentence is given before
that. In my favour.

843
01:02:57,854 --> 01:03:01,688
But the issue is going out of
*hand. - The police come home anytime.

844
01:03:01,758 --> 01:03:05,125
What the boys did isn't
a big mistake.

845
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:08,492
This happens in a young age.

846
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:10,698
Everyone does it.

847
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:15,862
The foolish thing was that if
they had to do all this...

848
01:03:16,539 --> 01:03:19,372
...they should've consulted
me first.

849
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,477
Anyway, they should remember
this in future.

850
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:26,242
Mr. Chadda, what should
we do now?

851
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:34,413
Mr. Gupta, I've understood all
*the pieces in the game right now.

852
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:40,461
I've also understood that in
this game, your son Shekhar...

853
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:44,866
...and your daughter-in-law
are very weak pieces.

854
01:03:45,702 --> 01:03:47,499
Specially the daughter-in-law.

855
01:03:48,204 --> 01:03:50,764
What's her name? Damini.

856
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:54,199
She's very emotional.

857
01:03:54,777 --> 01:03:57,803
And the police will quickly
smell her weakness...

858
01:03:57,881 --> 01:04:01,817
...and will go after her like
a dog after a bone.

859
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:06,612
You send her out of the city
fast. - What are you saying?

860
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,326
Damini is my daughter-in-law.

861
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,860
And my son, Shekhar loves
her very much.

862
01:04:16,232 --> 01:04:22,796
Mr. Gupta, love, friendship,
emotions, relationships...

863
01:04:23,473 --> 01:04:26,738
...are very cheap
and weak things.

864
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:30,239
They ruin a winning game.

865
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:35,645
Once you suffer from them,
you're finished.

866
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:43,317
And I, Inderjeet Chadda,
never accept defeat.

867
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:46,590
I will ruin everything.

868
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:50,565
But I will never be defeated.

869
01:05:01,644 --> 01:05:03,771
Madam!

870
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:06,212
Madam, help me!

871
01:05:15,558 --> 01:05:17,150
Urmi!

872
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:18,453
Urmi!

873
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:20,389
Urmi!

874
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:21,888
Urmi!

875
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:24,093
Urmi!

876
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:28,194
Urmi!

877
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:31,231
I'm Urmi!

878
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,615
I... I'm sorry, Damini!

879
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,158
Damini, what happened?

880
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:00,564
Control yourself, Damini.

881
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:04,562
You can't understand
what I go through...

882
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,108
...on seeing you in
this condition.

883
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:11,837
Look, Damini, I agree that what
you say is absolutely right.

884
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:15,517
But look at it from
my viewpoint.

885
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:19,184
How can I go against my family?

886
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:22,518
What do I do, Damini?

887
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:25,692
What do I do, Shekhar?

888
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:28,355
What do I do?

889
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:31,497
I know.

890
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:33,861
The whole family is
upset with me.

891
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:39,096
I don't want to hurt
anyone. No one.

892
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:45,536
But Shekhar, a sin has been
committed in this house.

893
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:48,514
And I'm unable to forget it.

894
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,116
You teach me Shekhar,
you tell me.

895
01:06:55,491 --> 01:07:00,724
How does one kill
one's conscience?

896
01:07:02,198 --> 01:07:03,529
Explain to me, Shekhar.

897
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,160
Because it's pricking
me from within.

898
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,831
I'm dying, Shekhar, I'm dying.

899
01:07:11,274 --> 01:07:12,434
Help me.

900
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:15,172
Help me, Shekhar.

901
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:27,685
Tell me, creep, who were they?

902
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:30,750
What're their names? Tell me!

903
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:32,519
Tell me!

904
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,722
Who took the car keys?
- I don't know sir.

905
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:35,889
Tell me! - I don't know!

906
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:39,329
It was good servants
didn't squeal.

907
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:44,139
Or forget Jaunpur, we'd have
been grinding grains in jail.

908
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,165
The police are constantly
after us.

909
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:49,773
Forget a bribe; they don't
even want to talk.

910
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:52,441
I don't understand. Sumitra.

911
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,806
Before the police makes
Damini speak up...

912
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:57,216
...send her somewhere far.
- But she should go first.

913
01:07:57,453 --> 01:08:01,355
She's just chanting one thing.
That she wants to meet Urmi.

914
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,191
Only Shekhar has stopped
her so far.

915
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:06,459
It has been four days
since the incident.

916
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:08,791
That stupid Urmi isn't dying
in the hospital either.

917
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:11,197
And this Damini isn't
letting us live.

918
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:12,461
It would've been better
if we had thrown her...

919
01:08:12,702 --> 01:08:14,863
...on the railway
tracks. - Please.

920
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:17,397
Look.

921
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,403
Somehow we'll have to convince
Damini that Urmi is alright.

922
01:08:21,611 --> 01:08:23,636
And she has gone to her village
with her grandpa.

923
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:28,339
Send Damini to Delhi
with Shekhar anyhow.

924
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:33,250
Damini. It's very important to
get the truth out of her, Ram.

925
01:08:33,856 --> 01:08:37,292
So in this case, be sensible,
not forceful. - But sir, I...

926
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,352
And tolerate what you have
to, while doing this.

927
01:08:40,763 --> 01:08:42,492
But win Damini's trust.

928
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,534
This case is very
important for us.

929
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:47,363
Okay, sir.

930
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:48,829
The flight is on time.

931
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:51,100
Damini, you wait here. I'll
get the luggage checked in.

932
01:08:53,743 --> 01:08:54,869
Hello, Ms. Damini.

933
01:08:56,312 --> 01:08:57,438
Inspector Kadam.

934
01:08:58,181 --> 01:08:59,773
I tried to meet you many times.

935
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:01,807
But your family didn't let me.

936
01:09:02,118 --> 01:09:03,210
So I thought... - Look.

937
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:05,516
If my family doesn't want
you to meet me...

938
01:09:05,788 --> 01:09:07,813
...you shouldn't be talking
to me like this.

939
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:11,087
Urmi might not be alive
by the time you return.

940
01:09:12,128 --> 01:09:15,325
She's dying. She's in
hospital. See this.

941
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:20,325
Urmi in a very bad condition.
Due to a vein bursting...

942
01:09:20,403 --> 01:09:21,665
...she's bleeding continuously.

943
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:23,170
She can't get up from the bed.

944
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:24,466
She's waiting for you.

945
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,407
She may have to live
like an invalid now.

946
01:09:27,477 --> 01:09:29,502
She can die too. - Look,
Ms. Damini...

947
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:32,838
What rubbish is this?
- Look, Mr. Gupta!

948
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:36,749
Get lost! - I'll destroy your
pride for your wealth!

949
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:39,344
What do you think! - Can you do
anything as you're a cop?

950
01:09:39,422 --> 01:09:41,117
Will you do as you please
since you're rich?

951
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,782
I'll take you to the court!
I'll take you to the court!

952
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:44,759
I'll shatter your pride
for your money!

953
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:46,658
Get lost! Threaten someone else!

954
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:48,663
You hit a cop! - Shut up!

955
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:49,891
You'll repent for this!

956
01:09:50,132 --> 01:09:51,224
Is this the way? - Come,
never mind.

957
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,358
He's taking advantage
of his position.

958
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:54,266
At home, then at the airport.

959
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:55,395
It's not our mistake at all.

960
01:09:55,471 --> 01:09:57,439
If he's a cop, it doesn't
mean he can do anything.

961
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:09,350
You keep insisting on going
to the hospital.

962
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:10,646
How will going to the
hospital help?

963
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:15,416
The inspector! Wonder
what he told you.

964
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,391
You're bent on going
to the hospital!

965
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,655
We're not going to the
hospital! We can't!

966
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:23,162
Mr. Chadda has said no
one from the family...

967
01:10:23,266 --> 01:10:25,291
...should go to the hospital.

968
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:28,296
We don't know what case the
police will make. And you...

969
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:35,172
You don't like it here, so I
thought I'll take you out.

970
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:37,207
I had to go to Delhi for
the company's work...

971
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,941
...so I thought business and
holiday could be together.

972
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:41,739
Now why are you quiet? Why
don't you say something?

973
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:45,518
Look Damini, my trip to
Delhi is important.

974
01:10:45,655 --> 01:10:47,680
I've missed the evening flight.
I can't miss the last one.

975
01:10:47,757 --> 01:10:48,951
Come on get ready. Pack up.

976
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:50,658
I won't go.

977
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,258
So go! Go to the hospital!
Meet Urmi!

978
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,229
She's everything for
you! We're nothing!

979
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:57,798
This family, our reputation!
It is nothing!

980
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,265
Tell the police everything.

981
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:02,229
Ruin it all! Make it
a spectacle! Damn!

982
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:04,766
You'll find peace!

983
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,202
Get my brother hanged!

984
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:13,873
I don't want that.

985
01:11:14,884 --> 01:11:16,511
I...

986
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:25,222
I... once, just once,
we'll meet Urmi.

987
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:33,395
If she's fine, being treated
well, we'll be at peace.

988
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:34,527
What do you want?

989
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:36,572
Do you think we're
Urmi's enemies?

990
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:38,537
Are we animals, stones!

991
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:40,599
We're doing what's to be
done, it's being done.

992
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:42,437
Dad was saying yesterday,
to give what she wants...

993
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:45,605
...100-200,000, but suppress
this issue, nothing else.

994
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:50,242
This won't ruin the family's
reputation and... - What?

995
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:56,650
You're setting a price
for that girl?

996
01:11:57,727 --> 01:12:02,096
Will money bring back all
that Urmi has lost?

997
01:12:04,467 --> 01:12:07,300
Those who think like this...

998
01:12:07,603 --> 01:12:10,663
...can even kill someone
for their reputation.

999
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:12,367
Anyone!

1000
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,805
It's possible even I...

1001
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,473
Madam! Madam! - Urmi!

1002
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,641
Madam! Madam! - Urmi!

1003
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,205
No! - Madam!

1004
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:59,516
Why didn't you come since
so many days, madam? - No!

1005
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:05,082
No one came, madam. No one!

1006
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:08,527
I didn't know that
you were in this...

1007
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:13,631
I was told that you were fine.

1008
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:17,569
No, madam. I'm not fine.

1009
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:21,434
I'm in a lot of pain!

1010
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,771
I'll talk to the doctor.

1011
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,713
I'll get your medicine and
everything arranged.

1012
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:31,444
Then you'll be fine
and come back home.

1013
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,648
No. Home? I won't go home.

1014
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:37,921
I'll go to my village.
To my grandfather.

1015
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:41,663
Your grandfather didn't come?

1016
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:45,289
Are you alone? - Yes.

1017
01:13:48,437 --> 01:13:51,531
I don't know if he
was told or not.

1018
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:57,606
I'll inform him. Your
grandfather will come.

1019
01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:01,439
You don't worry. Everything
will be fine.

1020
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:03,678
I will never be fine now. - No!

1021
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:05,744
You will be fine. - No!

1022
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,448
No, Urmi, you shouldn't
say that.

1023
01:14:07,523 --> 01:14:11,789
Look madam. My... my bleeding
doesn't stop.

1024
01:14:37,419 --> 01:14:40,217
You've helped the police a lot
by deciding to give a statement.

1025
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:42,380
But what are you all
doing for Urmi?

1026
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:44,558
From the streets you put
her in a hospital...

1027
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:46,386
...so is the police's duty over?

1028
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:48,627
She's neither being
treated properly...

1029
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:50,289
...nor is anyone looking
after her.

1030
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:52,898
Even her grandpa hasn't
been informed.

1031
01:14:53,235 --> 01:14:54,702
We've sent a constable
to her village.

1032
01:14:55,638 --> 01:15:00,268
Ms. Damini, I hope you don't
turn hostile tomorrow.

1033
01:15:00,476 --> 01:15:04,606
What? - I mean that your
husband isn't here now.

1034
01:15:05,581 --> 01:15:08,277
After he comes, under his
pressure you... - No.

1035
01:15:08,517 --> 01:15:10,815
I should've told you
this truth earlier.

1036
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:15,180
That day, I don't know why I...

1037
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:22,560
Now I'll never lie. Urmi
should just get well.

1038
01:15:24,466 --> 01:15:26,457
Her condition very
bad, Mr. Kadam.

1039
01:15:26,702 --> 01:15:29,637
We should admit her to some
good hospital so that...

1040
01:15:29,705 --> 01:15:32,640
Everything will be fine, Ms.
Damini. Now you're with us.

1041
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:36,902
Remember clearly what you saw
and give the statement.

1042
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:38,272
Come on.

1043
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:43,443
Look, due to my statement...

1044
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:47,518
...will my husband and
in-laws at some risk?

1045
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:50,118
Because it's not their fault.

1046
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:52,624
Look, you don't worry.

1047
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:56,389
I'm here. You give your
statement fearlessly. Go.

1048
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,541
Inspector Kadam. - Yes,
Kadam. - Hello sir.

1049
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:08,571
Good that you called.

1050
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:10,542
Damini is giving her statement.
- Good news.

1051
01:16:10,746 --> 01:16:12,145
Our case is strong now.

1052
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:14,682
Yes, sir. That's what she's
getting written.

1053
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:18,713
I've convinced her completely.

1054
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:22,182
Sir, Mr. Gupta had
called up too.

1055
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:24,725
We've spoken about 300,000.

1056
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:27,122
Congratulations, sir.

1057
01:16:27,596 --> 01:16:29,461
Now we have the statement too.

1058
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:33,128
We'll get more money. - Very
good just a minute.

1059
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:37,699
Mr. Bajaj, we've made
Damini squeal.

1060
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:40,139
Gupta is giving 300,000.

1061
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:41,640
To forget the case.

1062
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,836
Whatever Gupta is giving
to forget the case...

1063
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:49,413
...take 100,000 more from me
for raising this issue.

1064
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:53,478
Okay, let's see how much the
case is forgotten or raised.

1065
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:57,386
Kadam, the case is becoming
too important.

1066
01:16:57,526 --> 01:17:02,122
Be careful, okay? - Sir.
Think of my promotion.

1067
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:05,092
The promotion will be done,
Kadam, why do you worry?

1068
01:17:27,919 --> 01:17:29,045
Thank you.

1069
01:17:30,055 --> 01:17:31,522
Come on! Get up!

1070
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,956
But... Get up fast! - But
why... - Come on!

1071
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:36,224
Come on! You're a rich
father's son?

1072
01:17:36,328 --> 01:17:38,057
Listen to me... - Come on!

1073
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:41,258
When my husband comes, you'll
lose your job, just see!

1074
01:17:42,267 --> 01:17:45,361
I'll call Delhi just now.
- Call wherever you want.

1075
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,834
This warrant has been issued
on Damini's statement.

1076
01:17:47,906 --> 01:17:49,032
Do what you want.

1077
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:51,575
Sister! Damini!

1078
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:57,106
Damini! Come down! - Come down!

1079
01:17:57,249 --> 01:17:59,046
You spilt your venom at
the police station!

1080
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:00,379
Are you at peace now?

1081
01:18:01,086 --> 01:18:03,020
Wonder which moment
Shekhar saw you!

1082
01:18:03,188 --> 01:18:04,450
Everything is ruined.

1083
01:18:04,956 --> 01:18:06,480
Now get out of this house!

1084
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:08,520
I knew you would...

1085
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:17,398
I did what I felt was right for
this family's well-being.

1086
01:18:18,837 --> 01:18:23,240
If I've erred unknowingly,
forgive me.

1087
01:18:24,376 --> 01:18:28,369
Wherever I stay, I'll pray for
the well-being of this family.

1088
01:19:10,355 --> 01:19:13,347
A woman is like a man's
shoes. - Yes.

1089
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:17,358
And this woman has come
out of the kitchen...

1090
01:19:17,863 --> 01:19:19,353
...to challenge men!

1091
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:25,131
I'll never let Damini become
an example for other women.

1092
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:26,869
I'll send her to the
mental asylum.

1093
01:19:26,938 --> 01:19:30,135
Who's that girl to you? Who's
she? How's she related to you?

1094
01:19:30,876 --> 01:19:32,571
She's also is a woman like me.

1095
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:34,778
Is this relationship not enough?

1096
01:19:35,046 --> 01:19:36,570
I don't want to argue with you.

1097
01:19:37,082 --> 01:19:40,449
It's your in-laws' decency that
he still wants to take you home.

1098
01:19:40,952 --> 01:19:43,318
And a woman's real house is her
husband's, not her father's.

1099
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:50,453
Who has made this custom, dad...

1100
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:57,164
...that a woman's real house is
her husband's, not her father's?

1101
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:05,841
The house in which she grows,
is it snatched away from her?

1102
01:20:07,245 --> 01:20:11,238
Does a new relationship
break all the old ones?

1103
01:20:13,251 --> 01:20:17,847
Then doesn't the woman have
any right to that house?

1104
01:20:18,457 --> 01:20:20,220
We don't mean that, dear... - Mom.

1105
01:20:21,426 --> 01:20:23,155
Why is a woman an outsider?

1106
01:20:23,562 --> 01:20:25,826
Why is she called
another's wealth?

1107
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:31,901
If she has to leave her in-laws'
place for some reason...

1108
01:20:32,938 --> 01:20:34,235
...who's there for her?

1109
01:20:34,773 --> 01:20:36,240
Where will she go?

1110
01:20:38,076 --> 01:20:39,509
Should she commit suicide?

1111
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:42,876
Is there no custom
for that, mother?

1112
01:20:42,948 --> 01:20:46,941
Does a woman's palanquin go
from her house or her bier?

1113
01:20:47,486 --> 01:20:50,478
Does a father perform his
girl's nuptials or funeral?

1114
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:52,182
Enough dear, enough!

1115
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,914
Keep quiet now!

1116
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:56,588
Understand what I say, dear.

1117
01:20:57,195 --> 01:21:00,062
It's not about some days.

1118
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:02,098
It's about your whole life.

1119
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:05,795
How long will this
old couple live?

1120
01:21:06,505 --> 01:21:07,904
Don't be stubborn, dear.

1121
01:21:07,973 --> 01:21:10,407
Don't be scared.
You'll be on TV.

1122
01:21:10,475 --> 01:21:13,000
Everyone should know what
happened with you.

1123
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:15,012
Naren! Zoom in. Zoom
in to the face.

1124
01:21:15,146 --> 01:21:17,410
This mark on the face should be
visible. - What's happening?

1125
01:21:17,516 --> 01:21:19,313
Move.

1126
01:21:19,384 --> 01:21:20,908
Look. Look.

1127
01:21:20,986 --> 01:21:24,922
Look. When you were gang-raped,
how did you feel?

1128
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,048
How did you feel?

1129
01:21:26,124 --> 01:21:27,352
What cheap question
are you asking?

1130
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,256
Who're you? You're disturbing.
Move back.

1131
01:21:29,327 --> 01:21:32,353
Move back. Let us work. Naren I
want this mark. - Please, please.

1132
01:21:32,831 --> 01:21:35,197
Move her! The mark will be seen
only when we get light!

1133
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,460
What are you doing?

1134
01:21:36,535 --> 01:21:38,162
Are you her relative?

1135
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:41,371
I... I'm Damini. - Damini!

1136
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:43,805
Damini Gupta! - Damini Gupta!
Hey! Damini Gupta!

1137
01:21:43,942 --> 01:21:46,968
Damini! Damini Gupta!
- Ms. Damini!

1138
01:21:47,045 --> 01:21:48,569
Naren, pan the camera here.

1139
01:21:48,847 --> 01:21:50,872
Hello, I'm Rita Upadhyay
from Network.

1140
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:53,110
You must be watching
our video magazine.

1141
01:21:53,184 --> 01:21:55,084
Today, we have Damini
Gupta with us.

1142
01:21:55,153 --> 01:21:56,415
Kedarnath Gupta's
daughter-in-law.

1143
01:21:56,488 --> 01:21:58,820
Where has the old man
come from? Move him!

1144
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,551
He's the grandpa! The girl's
grandpa. - Grandpa?

1145
01:22:00,859 --> 01:22:02,156
Yes. - So sit here. Sit.

1146
01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:03,956
Let him sit. - Okay? Okay?

1147
01:22:04,095 --> 01:22:06,290
No, make him stand,
make him stand.

1148
01:22:06,898 --> 01:22:07,956
Give some backlight. Backlight!

1149
01:22:08,033 --> 01:22:09,830
What do you think of rape?

1150
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:11,458
What spectacle is this?
- Ms. Damini.

1151
01:22:11,536 --> 01:22:13,902
How did you get strength to
fight women's exploitation?

1152
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:17,806
She'll say that later. Naren,
pan from grandpa to Ms. Damini.

1153
01:22:17,876 --> 01:22:21,243
Ms. Damini, bring some anger and
a little sadness on the face.

1154
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,811
Ms. Damini, the sari's border
isn't looking good.

1155
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:25,349
Can you arrange for
another sari?

1156
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:27,146
Let it be. - Lift it up. Lift it.

1157
01:22:27,218 --> 01:22:29,118
Yes. - Move!

1158
01:22:29,187 --> 01:22:30,745
Move!

1159
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,354
Don't you feel ashamed?

1160
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:36,426
You want to dramatize and
sell a woman's ruin?!

1161
01:22:37,762 --> 01:22:40,196
You don't see this
innocent's pain.

1162
01:22:40,465 --> 01:22:42,262
You see my sari's border!

1163
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:44,325
That... - What do you
want to know?

1164
01:22:44,436 --> 01:22:46,461
Huh? What do you want to see?

1165
01:22:46,538 --> 01:22:48,301
Look!

1166
01:22:48,907 --> 01:22:51,239
Why? Why did your nose wiggle?

1167
01:22:51,977 --> 01:22:54,912
You love to write and publish
the truth! You can't see it!

1168
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:59,147
To see it, you need a kerchief!

1169
01:23:00,318 --> 01:23:03,014
Go! Go away!

1170
01:23:03,488 --> 01:23:09,859
Look we... - Go away!
Go! Or I'll scream!

1171
01:23:19,004 --> 01:23:22,030
You didn't tell me that
Damini has left home!

1172
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:25,071
Whenever I called from Delhi
you... - What could we do, Vijay?

1173
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,269
There were business
problems and...

1174
01:23:27,345 --> 01:23:29,438
There's life besides
business too, dad.

1175
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:34,910
Damini is emotional but
she's not bad at heart.

1176
01:23:35,153 --> 01:23:36,450
I'd have come and
set things right.

1177
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:40,287
You're saying as if it's our
fault. As if we threw her out.

1178
01:23:40,358 --> 01:23:42,826
We fell at her feet and cried.

1179
01:23:43,028 --> 01:23:44,791
We told her not to go.

1180
01:23:44,863 --> 01:23:46,763
No, lies! This is a lie!

1181
01:23:46,998 --> 01:23:48,329
Damini can't do this!

1182
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,097
Wow son! She has fooled
you in a few days.

1183
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:58,172
You're sad for her but not about
the police taking your brother!

1184
01:23:58,376 --> 01:24:02,107
Other, Rakesh is my...

1185
01:24:02,547 --> 01:24:04,447
Mother Damini too is this...

1186
01:24:05,417 --> 01:24:07,044
Mother!

1187
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:13,113
Dad, dad, you too...

1188
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:17,852
Son, you must be tired.
Get some rest.

1189
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:25,102
We've suffered so much
since childhood.

1190
01:24:27,038 --> 01:24:31,031
Mom and dad have been so worried
about our marriages.

1191
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,068
What have we not gone through?

1192
01:24:35,814 --> 01:24:38,544
And now, when you
have everything...

1193
01:24:38,983 --> 01:24:40,177
I've not forgotten anything.

1194
01:24:40,485 --> 01:24:42,043
I've not forgotten anything.

1195
01:24:43,088 --> 01:24:44,419
I understand everything.

1196
01:24:44,756 --> 01:24:48,192
Today, an innocent's life was
ruined in that house...

1197
01:24:48,493 --> 01:24:49,926
...and everyone is quiet.

1198
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:53,527
And they want me to
keep quiet too.

1199
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:56,960
I can't keep quiet, sister.

1200
01:24:57,102 --> 01:25:03,098
If I keep quiet, won't I become
a party to that sin? - No.

1201
01:25:03,174 --> 01:25:04,505
No, Chhoti.

1202
01:25:12,884 --> 01:25:16,115
I think the sun has risen
from the west today.

1203
01:25:16,988 --> 01:25:19,548
Damini in our humble home?

1204
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:22,023
Mr. Shekhar hasn't come?

1205
01:25:22,594 --> 01:25:24,084
No.

1206
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:28,131
Yes. He's not an ordinary man.

1207
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,028
He handles business
worth billions.

1208
01:25:31,903 --> 01:25:33,461
But get him once.

1209
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:37,403
I want to show him my program.

1210
01:25:38,076 --> 01:25:40,510
Birju mimicry artiste,
all in one!

1211
01:25:42,514 --> 01:25:44,505
Meena Kumari, get me some water.

1212
01:25:45,984 --> 01:25:48,248
She keeps crying. Doesn't
understand my talent.

1213
01:25:48,553 --> 01:25:51,818
Wow! Mother Goddess' idol!
We perform shows for Her.

1214
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,448
I do them for free. - Here.

1215
01:25:54,826 --> 01:25:55,952
Have you brought the
Munna's medicine?

1216
01:25:56,528 --> 01:25:59,929
Munna's medicine? - Yes. I
had given you the money.

1217
01:26:00,298 --> 01:26:02,163
Yes, Munna's medicine!

1218
01:26:02,233 --> 01:26:05,066
The thing is, I met my
cronies on the way.

1219
01:26:05,136 --> 01:26:08,071
Then we played rummy.
They won, I won.

1220
01:26:08,139 --> 01:26:13,008
At times they won, I lost. They
took everything and I'm here.

1221
01:26:13,077 --> 01:26:14,544
You only keep yapping!

1222
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,938
You can't earn a penny!

1223
01:26:17,282 --> 01:26:20,774
Whatever I earn through hard
work, you gamble it away!

1224
01:26:22,086 --> 01:26:24,281
It's always money, money, money!

1225
01:26:24,823 --> 01:26:26,791
You spoil my mood!

1226
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:28,255
You keep lecturing me!

1227
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:31,225
This is my house,
not your school!

1228
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:33,488
Don't talk to me like a teacher.

1229
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:35,858
I command such respect outside!

1230
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:37,896
She doesn't understand
my talent.

1231
01:26:38,736 --> 01:26:41,102
You're a curse on
my life. A curse!

1232
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,270
Or I'd have been famous today!

1233
01:26:46,344 --> 01:26:50,371
Yes, Ms. Damini. Do get Shekhar.

1234
01:26:50,815 --> 01:26:54,774
There's my program in
our colony next week.

1235
01:27:04,195 --> 01:27:11,294
Damini. Love is a blessing which
only the lucky ones receive.

1236
01:27:14,772 --> 01:27:18,765
You've got it. Don't reject it.

1237
01:27:20,845 --> 01:27:23,177
Shekhar adores you.

1238
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:26,543
And you left him?

1239
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,154
Is there anything greater
than love?

1240
01:27:42,033 --> 01:27:43,125
You?

1241
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:45,859
Sister! - You?

1242
01:27:45,937 --> 01:27:47,063
Please come.

1243
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:48,332
Greetings. - Greetings.

1244
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:53,507
When did you come from
Delhi? - Day before.

1245
01:27:56,114 --> 01:27:57,376
I'll just come from the market.

1246
01:27:58,016 --> 01:27:59,608
Please sit. - It's okay.

1247
01:28:01,552 --> 01:28:04,112
Shall I send a cold drink
for you? - No, thank you.

1248
01:28:06,024 --> 01:28:07,218
Please sit.

1249
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:09,456
Shall I prepare tea?

1250
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:11,594
You didn't do the right
thing, Damini.

1251
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,154
Leaving home like this.

1252
01:28:14,632 --> 01:28:16,429
Talking against the family
to the police.

1253
01:28:17,936 --> 01:28:19,130
All this...

1254
01:28:19,404 --> 01:28:21,531
I didn't say anything
against anyone.

1255
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:25,201
I just spoke the truth. - To
hell with your truth!

1256
01:28:26,144 --> 01:28:28,578
The police, press and others
who sympathize with you...

1257
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,576
...don't care for the truth
or Urmi's life!

1258
01:28:32,116 --> 01:28:35,017
They're only using
you. That's it!

1259
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:39,323
They want to exploit us
with you as their pawn!

1260
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:41,424
This is the politics of
rich people, Damini...

1261
01:28:41,492 --> 01:28:42,959
...why don't you understand?

1262
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:49,391
Damini, you're being made the
victim of their conspiracy.

1263
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:52,435
Everyone is playing this game
for his own benefit.

1264
01:28:53,204 --> 01:28:54,569
I don't understand this game.

1265
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,570
I only want justice for Urmi.

1266
01:28:58,977 --> 01:29:01,605
What justice? And from whom?

1267
01:29:02,213 --> 01:29:04,374
Nothing will happen,
Damini, nothing.

1268
01:29:06,451 --> 01:29:07,918
Look, Damini.

1269
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:09,843
Nothing is ruined yet.

1270
01:29:10,054 --> 01:29:12,215
Forget everything. Come home.

1271
01:29:12,357 --> 01:29:14,188
With me. For me.

1272
01:29:15,426 --> 01:29:18,293
I'll explain to mom and dad. You
shouldn't mind what they say.

1273
01:29:19,864 --> 01:29:23,891
And you'll be alone here,
I won't like it.

1274
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:29,505
Even I'm not happy staying
away from you.

1275
01:29:30,308 --> 01:29:31,969
But... - But what?

1276
01:29:32,377 --> 01:29:33,469
The same madness again!

1277
01:29:33,778 --> 01:29:35,302
The heart's burden. That truth!

1278
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:43,478
The sad thing is, Damini, that
for you, other things...

1279
01:29:44,122 --> 01:29:46,454
...are worth more than my love.

1280
01:29:53,865 --> 01:29:58,234
But my life... no.

1281
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:19,849
If Urmi goes to court, we'll
be jailed. - For what?

1282
01:30:20,091 --> 01:30:22,457
Urmi can't even walk now. And
the man who had gone to...

1283
01:30:23,027 --> 01:30:25,052
...the hospital from the court
for the statement...

1284
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:27,197
...has been bought by dad.

1285
01:30:27,498 --> 01:30:31,491
As for Damini, Chadda will
strip her in the court!

1286
01:30:31,569 --> 01:30:33,799
My dad also said not to worry.

1287
01:30:34,072 --> 01:30:36,563
This Damini's truth
doesn't matter.

1288
01:30:37,175 --> 01:30:40,008
The one who's rich
can do anything.

1289
01:30:40,078 --> 01:30:42,239
He can do anything. - He
can do anything.

1290
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:46,248
So shall we do it again?
- He'll rape again!

1291
01:31:41,839 --> 01:31:45,331
It's a conspiracy to defame
the Gupta clan.

1292
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:51,145
Whether Damini's story
is true or not...

1293
01:31:51,215 --> 01:31:54,343
...what she saw or didn't
see will be found later.

1294
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:58,386
I say no such thing happened
in Gupta's house.

1295
01:31:58,856 --> 01:32:03,520
Milord, that girl Urmi is of
loose character. - It's a lie.

1296
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:05,323
Urmi isn't of loose character.

1297
01:32:05,796 --> 01:32:08,856
She's a decent, hard-working,
honest girl, Milord! - Wait!

1298
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:12,133
But you're falsely accusing...
- Quiet! I'm speaking!

1299
01:32:12,203 --> 01:32:15,331
That girl is a thief, of loose
character and a cheat.

1300
01:32:15,606 --> 01:32:20,043
A week earlier she was
caught stealing and got fired.

1301
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:25,845
After that whether she was raped
or had fun with her friends...

1302
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:27,742
...what has the Gupta family
to do with that?

1303
01:32:27,818 --> 01:32:31,345
Objection Milord. Urmi was
raped by four boys...

1304
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:32,821
...and in the same house.

1305
01:32:33,357 --> 01:32:36,417
With the charge sheet, the
police's investigation report...

1306
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:38,422
...and the medical certificate
is also there.

1307
01:32:38,496 --> 01:32:42,125
That's why I want that... - You
want a lot, Mr. Saxena.

1308
01:32:42,934 --> 01:32:44,231
This is a court.

1309
01:32:44,902 --> 01:32:48,235
Not a temple or mosque where
wishes are fulfilled.

1310
01:32:49,207 --> 01:32:55,407
Hard evidence is presented here,
not coconuts or incense sticks.

1311
01:32:55,980 --> 01:33:00,417
And I've exposed many such false
cases in this very court!

1312
01:33:00,952 --> 01:33:02,317
You have seen it too.

1313
01:33:02,987 --> 01:33:06,445
Yes, Ms. Damini. Was she
clothed then or not?

1314
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:13,156
Judge, I've already said
that the rape was done.

1315
01:33:13,998 --> 01:33:16,125
Is this question necessary?

1316
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:20,296
That's why I'm asking, was
she clothed or not?

1317
01:33:20,871 --> 01:33:25,467
When I saw her first,
at that time...

1318
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:28,773
Speak louder, I can't hear.
What did you see?

1319
01:33:29,313 --> 01:33:32,043
When I saw her first,
she was okay.

1320
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:33,811
They were just taking her away.

1321
01:33:35,353 --> 01:33:39,551
And when I reached there
with my husband...

1322
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:40,916
Was she naked?

1323
01:33:42,994 --> 01:33:47,522
Speak up. - At that time,
she was clothed but...

1324
01:33:47,765 --> 01:33:50,791
Speak louder I can't hear, I
*said it earlier too! Speak louder!

1325
01:33:50,868 --> 01:33:53,928
The sari was there, but
it was only wrapped.

1326
01:33:54,005 --> 01:33:55,939
So that girl was half-naked.

1327
01:33:56,407 --> 01:33:59,171
Okay, now tell me, what were
the four boys doing?

1328
01:34:00,378 --> 01:34:03,939
I think... - Don't think,
speak with conviction!

1329
01:34:04,248 --> 01:34:06,443
It's about the lives
of four young boys.

1330
01:34:06,784 --> 01:34:07,876
Say it with conviction.

1331
01:34:08,519 --> 01:34:15,857
Two boys were near her head.
- Where were their hands?

1332
01:34:15,926 --> 01:34:17,917
On her chest or shoulders?

1333
01:34:19,997 --> 01:34:23,262
Two boys had caught her and...

1334
01:34:23,334 --> 01:34:26,098
...had held her hands.

1335
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:27,535
And what was the
third boy doing?

1336
01:34:27,938 --> 01:34:29,530
He was near her feet and...

1337
01:34:29,774 --> 01:34:32,766
Speak louder I can't hear, I
*said it earlier too! Speak louder!

1338
01:34:33,477 --> 01:34:37,038
One boy was sitting near her
feet and had caught her foot.

1339
01:34:37,114 --> 01:34:40,015
Look at me and speak. Don't
lower your gaze!

1340
01:34:40,084 --> 01:34:41,244
Look at me!

1341
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:45,389
Was he holding her
feet or thighs?

1342
01:34:45,556 --> 01:34:47,421
Do you know what thighs are?

1343
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:51,125
The part above the knees
is known as thighs.

1344
01:34:51,195 --> 01:34:53,493
Was he holding her
feet or thighs?

1345
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:58,232
Thighs. - He was holding
her thighs.

1346
01:34:58,502 --> 01:35:00,868
And what was the fourth
boy doing?

1347
01:35:02,039 --> 01:35:03,768
The fourth boy...

1348
01:35:08,913 --> 01:35:14,215
He... was lying near Urmi.

1349
01:35:14,285 --> 01:35:19,222
Was he lying near her
or abo... - Shut up!

1350
01:35:33,304 --> 01:35:37,138
Now tell me. If I present
some boys before you...

1351
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:41,743
...will you be able to recognize
those four among them?

1352
01:35:43,013 --> 01:35:44,776
Yes. - Milord,

1353
01:35:45,116 --> 01:35:47,209
I'd like to present some
boys in the court...

1354
01:35:47,485 --> 01:35:48,543
...with your permission.

1355
01:35:48,786 --> 01:35:51,186
Permission granted.
- Come on, boys.

1356
01:35:58,028 --> 01:36:01,191
But they were only four boys.

1357
01:36:01,265 --> 01:36:03,324
You'll have to recognize
those four from these.

1358
01:36:03,534 --> 01:36:06,367
That day was Holi and everyone
was colored like this.

1359
01:36:06,437 --> 01:36:08,564
Come, recognize them. - Yes.

1360
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,569
Come, come. Look closely.

1361
01:36:11,909 --> 01:36:14,104
Don't get scared. Look properly.

1362
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:17,303
Yes, look carefully.
Was he the one? No.

1363
01:36:17,381 --> 01:36:22,409
Next. He? Look closely, closely.
Don't be scared. Look.

1364
01:36:23,521 --> 01:36:24,818
Look.

1365
01:36:24,955 --> 01:36:28,015
Is he the one? - Hold him
back! I'm identifying!

1366
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:29,850
Recognize! He?

1367
01:36:30,428 --> 01:36:32,760
Judge, there weren't so
many colors that day.

1368
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,229
This is how the colors
of Holi are!

1369
01:36:34,932 --> 01:36:36,923
Look! Recognize, is he the one?

1370
01:36:37,201 --> 01:36:39,135
Judge, please ask him
to hold them back.

1371
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:40,534
He's trying to confuse me.

1372
01:36:41,872 --> 01:36:42,930
Is he the one?

1373
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:46,272
He... - Wrong! He's constable
Jadhav! Go!

1374
01:36:46,343 --> 01:36:48,834
But I didn't say that he...
- Never mind. Never mind.

1375
01:36:48,913 --> 01:36:50,175
One makes mistakes,
one makes mistakes.

1376
01:36:50,247 --> 01:36:51,737
Look, is he the one?

1377
01:36:51,816 --> 01:36:53,875
Was he holding the hands!
- Hold them back!

1378
01:36:53,951 --> 01:36:55,475
Was he holding the feet?
- Hold them back!

1379
01:36:55,553 --> 01:36:58,113
Recognize! Was he holding
her thighs! - Back!

1380
01:36:58,189 --> 01:37:00,555
Keep them away! Keep them away!

1381
01:37:00,791 --> 01:37:02,554
Keep them away!

1382
01:37:02,827 --> 01:37:07,196
Go out! Out! Out! - Mr. Chadda,
what do you want to prove?

1383
01:37:07,331 --> 01:37:11,461
I wanted to prove that this
girl is insane! - What?

1384
01:37:11,769 --> 01:37:14,567
On seeing colors, she loses her
mental balance! - No, no!

1385
01:37:14,939 --> 01:37:16,964
There's no such thing... - She
starts spinning yarns!

1386
01:37:17,107 --> 01:37:20,770
This is all a lie... - She behaves
abnormally! - Father, look...

1387
01:37:20,845 --> 01:37:22,335
She screams! Shouts!

1388
01:37:22,413 --> 01:37:23,505
I... - Quiet!

1389
01:37:23,781 --> 01:37:24,873
Objection Milord!

1390
01:37:24,982 --> 01:37:26,950
Mr. Chadda is trying to
complicate the case!

1391
01:37:27,017 --> 01:37:30,953
Milord. I want to present
some more witnesses.

1392
01:37:31,121 --> 01:37:34,386
One day I saw her looking at
the design on the floor.

1393
01:37:35,459 --> 01:37:40,897
She was talking to herself.
Blabbering insanely.

1394
01:37:41,065 --> 01:37:44,034
I had got her a Bandini
printed dress.

1395
01:37:44,101 --> 01:37:45,796
It was so colorful, Judge.

1396
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:49,133
But this crazy one tore that
dress to rags! Yes!

1397
01:37:50,574 --> 01:37:54,066
I had brought her multi-colored
threads for embroidery.

1398
01:37:54,245 --> 01:37:56,304
She looked at them as if I had...

1399
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:58,940
...opened a basket of snakes
and scorpions!

1400
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:01,946
She began abusing
me. Crazy woman!

1401
01:38:02,019 --> 01:38:04,487
Milord they're lying to save
their family honor!

1402
01:38:05,022 --> 01:38:08,458
Milord, now I'll present
a witness...

1403
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:10,426
...who isn't from the
Gupta family.

1404
01:38:10,494 --> 01:38:12,359
Damini's father,
Mr. Chandrakant.

1405
01:38:20,271 --> 01:38:22,296
Swear that you'll speak
the truth. - Yes.

1406
01:38:22,506 --> 01:38:28,206
Is it true that your daughter
Damini's mentally unstable?

1407
01:38:28,279 --> 01:38:29,871
No. - What? - Yes?

1408
01:38:30,948 --> 01:38:32,313
Yes.

1409
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:34,847
She was eight-years old...

1410
01:38:34,919 --> 01:38:38,184
...when she was playing Holi with
her friends on the terrace.

1411
01:38:39,223 --> 01:38:43,353
She fell from the terrace on
Holi and lost her senses.

1412
01:38:43,427 --> 01:38:45,918
What? - She was unconscious
for three hours.

1413
01:38:46,163 --> 01:38:48,131
When she came to... - Dad?

1414
01:38:48,265 --> 01:38:51,234
She started behaving strangely.
She started blabbering.

1415
01:38:51,368 --> 01:38:53,427
Since then we keep her
away from colors.

1416
01:38:54,505 --> 01:38:56,496
She started imagining
weird things.

1417
01:38:57,241 --> 01:38:59,402
Making stories. - Point
to be noted, Milord.

1418
01:39:00,844 --> 01:39:03,005
But Damini was very nice.

1419
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:05,007
She's a very good
daughter of mine.

1420
01:39:05,249 --> 01:39:06,910
She takes such good
care of the house...

1421
01:39:06,984 --> 01:39:09,111
Okay, you can go now. Go.

1422
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,553
Milord... - Judge!

1423
01:39:12,156 --> 01:39:14,989
Damini is a good daughter.

1424
01:39:15,859 --> 01:39:17,588
May all parents get
such daughters!

1425
01:39:18,862 --> 01:39:21,194
She has never harmed
anyone, Judge!

1426
01:39:21,632 --> 01:39:25,193
She'll never want to harm
anyone. - Okay, okay, you go.

1427
01:39:25,269 --> 01:39:27,794
Go and sit. Go.

1428
01:39:32,209 --> 01:39:34,268
Dad!

1429
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:41,575
Milord! This girl, Damini
is an insane girl.

1430
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:44,253
And taking advantage of this...

1431
01:39:44,555 --> 01:39:48,252
...the Gupta family's enemies,
their business rivals...

1432
01:39:48,325 --> 01:39:49,792
...have disgraced them.

1433
01:39:50,127 --> 01:39:52,925
I wish that the accusations
against those four boys...

1434
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:59,032
...should be taken back and
Damini should be sent to...

1435
01:39:59,336 --> 01:40:01,031
...a good mental asylum
for treatment.

1436
01:40:01,205 --> 01:40:02,502
That's all Your Honor.

1437
01:40:04,842 --> 01:40:06,503
After hearing the witnesses'
statements...

1438
01:40:06,944 --> 01:40:08,605
...this court concludes that...

1439
01:40:09,146 --> 01:40:12,445
...Damini should be kept in a
government mental asylum...

1440
01:40:12,516 --> 01:40:15,076
...for two weeks under
doctors' observation.

1441
01:40:15,486 --> 01:40:17,181
After the doctors' report...

1442
01:40:17,454 --> 01:40:19,615
...the next hearing of this
case will be fixed.

1443
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:28,227
You've made a spectacle
out of Damini!

1444
01:40:28,432 --> 01:40:30,798
Chadda had said that he'll
get case dismissed today.

1445
01:40:31,001 --> 01:40:32,525
On your saying, I didn't
come to the court...

1446
01:40:32,836 --> 01:40:34,804
...and now you're saying she has
been sent to a mental asylum!

1447
01:40:35,139 --> 01:40:36,333
I don't understand...

1448
01:40:36,774 --> 01:40:40,301
What's your enmity with Damini?
What sin has she committed?

1449
01:40:41,412 --> 01:40:44,381
Damini is my wife, your
daughter-in-law...

1450
01:40:44,448 --> 01:40:48,407
...this family's honor... - Go
get her! Get her here!

1451
01:40:49,153 --> 01:40:50,586
And send all of us to jail!

1452
01:40:51,255 --> 01:40:54,281
Ruin this family's honor!
Ruin everything!

1453
01:40:54,358 --> 01:40:56,189
Do what you want!

1454
01:41:00,464 --> 01:41:02,159
When you talked of marriage...

1455
01:41:02,332 --> 01:41:04,232
...we didn't see the family
or the status.

1456
01:41:04,401 --> 01:41:07,529
We just your love and made
her our daughter-in-law.

1457
01:41:07,604 --> 01:41:10,869
And today she's bent on ruining
this family's honor!

1458
01:41:10,941 --> 01:41:13,205
And we should stand
and just watch!

1459
01:41:14,445 --> 01:41:18,404
But father, Damini too...
- Look Shekhar.

1460
01:41:20,884 --> 01:41:25,321
This fight is not
to harm Damini.

1461
01:41:25,856 --> 01:41:29,383
We're fighting to save this
family's reputation.

1462
01:41:30,394 --> 01:41:31,884
It's just a matter
of some days, son.

1463
01:41:32,362 --> 01:41:35,559
We'll get a report that she's
mentally unstable.

1464
01:41:35,799 --> 01:41:38,825
Whatever she said had
never happened.

1465
01:41:39,336 --> 01:41:40,496
The case will be over.

1466
01:41:41,171 --> 01:41:42,365
Bring her back.

1467
01:41:42,873 --> 01:41:45,307
I'll go with you to
bring her back.

1468
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:50,512
Enough. I'm your father.

1469
01:41:52,049 --> 01:41:54,017
I know you well, son.

1470
01:41:54,518 --> 01:41:58,352
I won't let anything that
hurts you, happen.

1471
01:42:01,358 --> 01:42:04,191
Can I meet Damini?

1472
01:42:08,799 --> 01:42:13,202
You shouldn't meet
her for some days. - Why?

1473
01:42:13,604 --> 01:42:16,539
The police, press have their
eye on this case.

1474
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:20,376
The case shouldn't get
more complicated.

1475
01:42:21,979 --> 01:42:24,948
Look, son. It's just a
matter of a few days.

1476
01:42:25,415 --> 01:42:26,848
Everything will be fine.

1477
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:31,287
You had said the case will be
dismissed if I lie in court.

1478
01:42:31,989 --> 01:42:34,116
I said you what you told me to.

1479
01:42:34,758 --> 01:42:37,249
Bring my daughter to
your house soon.

1480
01:42:37,828 --> 01:42:40,388
She's in the mental asylum. - Mr.
Chandrakant, don't worry...

1481
01:42:40,464 --> 01:42:42,398
...she'll come very soon. Go.

1482
01:42:42,466 --> 01:42:47,961
She'll come soon. - Mr. Bajaj!
Come, come, come.

1483
01:42:49,239 --> 01:42:51,867
Yes, go. I said she'll come. Go.

1484
01:42:51,942 --> 01:42:53,807
Come, sit, Mr. Bajaj.

1485
01:42:54,778 --> 01:42:58,976
Mr. Gupta, Mr. Bajaj,
now forget the past.

1486
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:02,348
Damini won't come back now.

1487
01:43:02,586 --> 01:43:07,114
You think about yourselves
and unite.

1488
01:43:07,457 --> 01:43:09,823
Become relatives! Relatives!

1489
01:43:09,893 --> 01:43:13,795
I just wish my daughter becomes
their daughter-in-law.

1490
01:43:14,198 --> 01:43:17,292
I had to hold this marriage due
to Shekhar's adamancy or...

1491
01:43:17,367 --> 01:43:18,800
...we weren't happy either.

1492
01:43:18,869 --> 01:43:21,030
I wasn't with the name itself.

1493
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:23,069
Damini! Lightning!

1494
01:43:23,273 --> 01:43:26,003
She struck like lightning
and separated you two.

1495
01:43:27,244 --> 01:43:31,340
Uncle! Such lightning glimmers
like a fire-fly...

1496
01:43:31,415 --> 01:43:34,441
...in Chadda's backyard!

1497
01:43:35,419 --> 01:43:40,288
Go. Arrange for some champagne.
- Yes, right away.

1498
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:43,391
What Mr. Chadda said is final.

1499
01:43:44,027 --> 01:43:46,996
I've restrained Shekhar
so far saying that...

1500
01:43:47,531 --> 01:43:50,091
...Damini is being taken care
of in the mental asylum.

1501
01:43:50,367 --> 01:43:54,497
But if he finds... - She's
being treated well, Gupta.

1502
01:43:55,272 --> 01:44:00,869
Everything's arranged to make
Damini insane in the asylum.

1503
01:44:02,045 --> 01:44:05,014
She's been given many shocks.

1504
01:44:06,149 --> 01:44:13,419
Let's see how many shocks
this lightning can take!

1505
01:44:15,392 --> 01:44:22,321
With my third eye, I
see Damini's end.

1506
01:44:44,922 --> 01:44:48,221
Father will come,
mother will come.

1507
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:50,986
Sister will come.

1508
01:44:52,296 --> 01:45:00,067
They'll then pull my braid
and take me far away!

1509
01:45:00,337 --> 01:45:02,168
In the train!

1510
01:45:31,501 --> 01:45:36,131
She's spinning it! Look! She's
spinning it! - Quiet!

1511
01:45:36,206 --> 01:45:37,434
Or I'll hit you!

1512
01:45:40,477 --> 01:45:42,206
She'll hit me!

1513
01:45:43,747 --> 01:45:47,808
I'll tell mother. She'll
hit everyone!

1514
01:45:49,186 --> 01:45:51,177
Everyone hits me!

1515
01:45:51,521 --> 01:45:55,480
I'll tell sister. She'll also
come and hit everyone.

1516
01:45:56,126 --> 01:45:58,458
She'll hit everyone!

1517
01:48:42,259 --> 01:48:44,056
Why haven't you turned
Damini insane yet?

1518
01:48:45,328 --> 01:48:48,058
Scaring her too much or giving
her many shocks...

1519
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:50,395
...could cause brain hemorrhage.
She could even die.

1520
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:51,899
She could die?

1521
01:48:52,035 --> 01:48:54,936
Doctor have there been
any such deaths here?

1522
01:48:55,338 --> 01:48:57,272
We do take complete precautions.

1523
01:48:57,941 --> 01:48:59,966
But some patients have
committed suicide.

1524
01:49:00,443 --> 01:49:02,877
So Damini should commit
suicide too. - What?

1525
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:06,048
I mean, doctor, that
if you can...

1526
01:49:06,116 --> 01:49:07,947
...such death which
appears suicide.

1527
01:49:08,018 --> 01:49:09,986
She can die accidentally.
- Doctor!

1528
01:49:10,053 --> 01:49:12,180
Yes? - Doctor, Damini
isn't in her room.

1529
01:49:12,255 --> 01:49:13,552
What? - Yes. - Come on.

1530
01:49:18,261 --> 01:49:20,422
We take good care
but I don't how...

1531
01:49:20,497 --> 01:49:22,089
What care! Is this a
hospital or a maze!

1532
01:49:22,265 --> 01:49:23,823
You'll pay heavily
for this, madam.

1533
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:24,958
Rakesh! - Tell me!

1534
01:49:25,035 --> 01:49:26,866
I searched the ground, kitchen,
but couldn't find her.

1535
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:43,017
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1536
01:49:43,153 --> 01:49:46,122
Hey! Stop! Hey!

1537
01:49:46,356 --> 01:49:47,846
Hey!

1538
01:49:50,193 --> 01:49:51,319
Leave me!

1539
01:49:55,432 --> 01:49:56,524
Hey listen!

1540
01:50:02,038 --> 01:50:03,505
Excuse me, doctor! - Yes.

1541
01:50:03,573 --> 01:50:06,007
It's dad's call downstairs
and Mr. Chadda...

1542
01:50:06,076 --> 01:50:07,509
...also wants to talk with you.

1543
01:50:07,911 --> 01:50:10,209
It's very, very urgent.
Shall we go?

1544
01:50:11,915 --> 01:50:13,041
Come on.

1545
01:50:48,018 --> 01:50:50,486
Ram Singh! Ram Singh! - Yes, sir!

1546
01:50:50,553 --> 01:50:52,418
One girl has escaped
from the asylum!

1547
01:50:52,489 --> 01:50:54,047
Come, let's check! Come fast!

1548
01:51:14,377 --> 01:51:16,572
There she is! In front!
Catch her! Fast!

1549
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:26,588
Open the door!

1550
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:55,983
Help me! Help me!

1551
01:51:58,955 --> 01:52:00,252
Help me!

1552
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:04,126
Hey drunkard! Leave the girl!

1553
01:52:04,794 --> 01:52:05,920
Haven't you heard?

1554
01:52:10,133 --> 01:52:11,191
Move back!

1555
01:52:13,069 --> 01:52:14,969
Leave her! - Leave the girl!

1556
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:35,148
Peter!

1557
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:35,847
I think it's going to rain.

1558
01:53:37,987 --> 01:53:40,012
My house is close by.

1559
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:43,923
If you want, you can
stay for sometime.

1560
01:53:45,762 --> 01:53:47,059
I'll drop you.

1561
01:54:17,093 --> 01:54:19,584
Here. Have tea.

1562
01:54:20,964 --> 01:54:22,329
It'll be good for you.

1563
01:54:23,233 --> 01:54:26,430
I'll arrange for a rickshaw.
- You're a lawyer?

1564
01:54:27,403 --> 01:54:28,495
I was, once.

1565
01:54:28,938 --> 01:54:31,771
Who were the ones following you?

1566
01:54:32,942 --> 01:54:35,103
My name is Damini.

1567
01:54:43,019 --> 01:54:44,452
Is this the place? - Yes.

1568
01:54:44,521 --> 01:54:46,045
That drunkard had taken
her from here.

1569
01:54:46,923 --> 01:54:49,153
Forget it, Damini. Forget it.

1570
01:54:50,026 --> 01:54:51,891
Forget this court.

1571
01:54:52,495 --> 01:54:53,928
You won't get anything.

1572
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:56,499
So won't we get justice?

1573
01:54:56,566 --> 01:55:02,232
Justice? I've seen the nakedness
of justice and law, Damini.

1574
01:55:02,405 --> 01:55:04,100
Not seen, I've suffered it.

1575
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:07,773
Truth. Conscience.
It's all rubbish.

1576
01:55:08,545 --> 01:55:12,572
Those who live for them
get only pain.

1577
01:55:12,949 --> 01:55:16,942
My wife Aarti also had
ideals like you.

1578
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:18,487
She's used to talk like you.

1579
01:55:18,855 --> 01:55:21,085
It was her dream that
I become a barrister.

1580
01:55:22,058 --> 01:55:24,185
That I fight for truth
and justice.

1581
01:55:25,328 --> 01:55:28,024
One day she was buying something
from the footpath.

1582
01:55:28,965 --> 01:55:34,369
A drunken rich guy crushed
her under his car.

1583
01:55:38,341 --> 01:55:44,177
Damini, I couldn't even
get justice for her.

1584
01:55:45,014 --> 01:55:46,413
They were the same people.

1585
01:55:46,783 --> 01:55:49,013
This Chadda, this court,
all of them.

1586
01:55:49,285 --> 01:55:51,276
Witnesses were bought,
turned hostile.

1587
01:55:51,421 --> 01:55:54,481
People sell their honesty for
pennies, Damini, for pennies!

1588
01:55:55,558 --> 01:55:57,788
If one law is created
to stop a crime...

1589
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:00,328
...ten ways are created
to break it.

1590
01:56:00,496 --> 01:56:04,398
And in this, what justice
will one get?

1591
01:56:05,301 --> 01:56:06,495
And I?

1592
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:11,470
Like a fool, kept going
to the court.

1593
01:56:12,008 --> 01:56:15,068
And all I got was a date.

1594
01:56:17,547 --> 01:56:21,847
I agree that time was
very cruel to you.

1595
01:56:22,218 --> 01:56:26,416
But if you lose heart, who'll
fight for those like us?

1596
01:56:26,789 --> 01:56:29,121
I've quit going to
court, Damini.

1597
01:56:30,126 --> 01:56:32,424
Not for mine or Urmi's sake...

1598
01:56:32,962 --> 01:56:36,090
...for Aarti's sake... - Don't
mention Aarti, Damini!

1599
01:56:36,366 --> 01:56:40,268
I'm not mentioning
but reminding you.

1600
01:56:40,536 --> 01:56:44,870
She wanted to make you a
barrister so that you could...

1601
01:56:44,941 --> 01:56:46,932
...get justice for the poor and
weak... - I'm dead for this world!

1602
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:48,307
Dead!

1603
01:56:49,746 --> 01:56:59,280
So is a girl, her life, her
honor nothing to you?

1604
01:56:59,355 --> 01:57:02,017
It isn't! It isn't!

1605
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:06,351
Okay. Then forget everything.

1606
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:09,397
Drown in your liquor!

1607
01:57:10,833 --> 01:57:14,064
Aarti's soul will get
peace! - Damini!

1608
01:57:17,206 --> 01:57:20,437
The court which has mocked
at my Aarti's death...

1609
01:57:21,177 --> 01:57:24,476
...I won't ever go that
court! Never!

1610
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:38,518
You had said you'd dispatched
this letter, but this is here!

1611
01:57:38,795 --> 01:57:40,592
Sir, I thought... - What
did you think?

1612
01:57:41,264 --> 01:57:43,960
You thought you'll lie
and get away with it?

1613
01:57:44,133 --> 01:57:45,464
Why do you fear the truth?

1614
01:57:45,802 --> 01:57:48,066
Let it be, Shekhar, it's a
small thing. - No, Naren!

1615
01:57:48,471 --> 01:57:51,565
Why does man lie? Why does
he fear the truth? Why?

1616
01:57:52,909 --> 01:57:55,343
Everyone is lying. Everyone!

1617
01:58:08,858 --> 01:58:10,917
I just hope everything
is okay with Damini.

1618
01:58:12,261 --> 01:58:13,558
I hope everything's fine.

1619
01:58:13,629 --> 01:58:15,221
No! I won't open it.

1620
01:58:15,364 --> 01:58:17,423
Damini has to be taken to
the asylum. Come on.

1621
01:58:17,567 --> 01:58:19,125
I won't let you take
her to the asylum!

1622
01:58:19,202 --> 01:58:21,102
They're making excuses to
avoid taking her home!

1623
01:58:21,370 --> 01:58:23,133
It's the court's order.
How can she not go?

1624
01:58:23,206 --> 01:58:26,175
No! She's not at home.
I can't open the door.

1625
01:58:26,375 --> 01:58:27,933
Sharma, break the
door. - Yes, sir.

1626
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:30,444
Damini you escape! Escape
from the window!

1627
01:58:30,813 --> 01:58:32,041
Run!

1628
01:58:34,584 --> 01:58:36,415
She has escaped from the
window, follow her!

1629
01:58:45,194 --> 01:58:46,957
Enough, Damini! Enough!

1630
01:58:47,096 --> 01:58:50,259
Come quietly, or I'll
have to use force!

1631
01:58:50,333 --> 01:58:52,801
Vow, Kadam, vow! You showed
great agility!

1632
01:58:55,538 --> 01:58:57,267
So you were finally promoted.

1633
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:01,137
You've been given the job
of using force on women.

1634
01:59:02,345 --> 01:59:04,973
You've stopped practicing so
have you forgotten law, Govind?

1635
01:59:05,381 --> 01:59:07,941
I've an arrest warrant
for this woman.

1636
01:59:08,117 --> 01:59:11,382
Even I've a piece of government
paper. Stay order.

1637
01:59:12,155 --> 01:59:14,589
Now Damini won't go anywhere
till the next hearing.

1638
01:59:15,091 --> 01:59:17,150
Go to those whom you're
serving these days...

1639
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,555
...and find some new way out.

1640
01:59:21,063 --> 01:59:22,530
I'll see you, Govind.

1641
01:59:23,232 --> 01:59:27,566
Whenever, wherever you want,
send a constable...

1642
01:59:28,104 --> 01:59:29,332
...I'll show you.

1643
01:59:30,173 --> 01:59:32,073
Watch your step, Kadam.

1644
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:33,965
The case is very slippery.

1645
01:59:34,143 --> 01:59:36,941
If you slip, you'll
go tumbling down!

1646
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:43,443
No, Damini. No.

1647
01:59:45,087 --> 01:59:46,349
You won't cry now.

1648
01:59:47,123 --> 01:59:48,215
They will cry.

1649
01:59:49,258 --> 01:59:51,886
No. They.

1650
01:59:52,028 --> 01:59:55,020
We're finished, ruined,
destroyed!

1651
01:59:56,065 --> 01:59:58,090
Only two ways are left,
brother-in-law.

1652
01:59:58,301 --> 02:00:01,270
If we're saved, then Jaunpur or
the mental asylum! - Shut up!

1653
02:00:01,337 --> 02:00:04,329
Jaunpur! Jaunpur! Jaunpur!
Have you gone crazy?

1654
02:00:04,807 --> 02:00:06,934
I haven't gone crazy alone.

1655
02:00:07,176 --> 02:00:10,509
We have all gone crazy.

1656
02:00:11,047 --> 02:00:14,244
This Chhada used to say,
lightning like Damini...

1657
02:00:14,517 --> 02:00:19,580
...glows like a fire-fly
in his backyard!

1658
02:00:20,389 --> 02:00:22,118
Hasn't lightning struck you?

1659
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:26,954
He was out to make Damini
insane! - Uncle!

1660
02:00:27,263 --> 02:00:29,254
Learn to stay within
your long shirt!

1661
02:00:31,467 --> 02:00:34,231
Will that drunkard
Govind save her?

1662
02:00:37,073 --> 02:00:40,406
Last time too, I had trapped
him so badly in dates...

1663
02:00:41,377 --> 02:00:43,845
...that he forgotten the
way to the court!

1664
02:00:44,981 --> 02:00:47,245
That's what will happen now too.

1665
02:00:48,584 --> 02:00:53,886
I'll press such a nerve
that he'll scream!

1666
02:00:55,424 --> 02:00:57,517
Urmi!

1667
02:01:01,063 --> 02:01:03,224
What has happened?

1668
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:07,567
Grandpa, how did this...

1669
02:01:12,275 --> 02:01:18,441
Madam, she's gone!

1670
02:01:20,616 --> 02:01:23,346
Till yesterday, she
was so happy.

1671
02:01:23,619 --> 02:01:26,281
She was saying we'll all
go to the village.

1672
02:01:28,557 --> 02:01:30,923
Mr. Govind, this...

1673
02:01:31,827 --> 02:01:32,953
Urmi!

1674
02:01:35,264 --> 02:01:37,391
She was to be operated
yesterday.

1675
02:01:38,334 --> 02:01:39,892
The patient couldn't
bear the pain.

1676
02:01:40,002 --> 02:01:41,162
She committed suicide.

1677
02:01:41,237 --> 02:01:43,000
Urmi can't commit suicide!

1678
02:01:43,506 --> 02:01:45,474
This is a lie! - What's
the lie about this?

1679
02:01:46,042 --> 02:01:47,100
Everything is the truth.

1680
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:49,935
This is Urmi's letter
found in her hand.

1681
02:01:50,313 --> 02:01:52,178
And we've just done
the survey too.

1682
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:58,186
Damini, read Mr. Kadam's truth.

1683
02:02:00,489 --> 02:02:05,256
Now I can't bear the pain.

1684
02:02:06,228 --> 02:02:08,059
The pain is increasing.

1685
02:02:09,265 --> 02:02:13,565
I'm willfully committing
suicide.

1686
02:02:16,339 --> 02:02:19,103
This is a lie. This is
not Urmi's letter.

1687
02:02:19,508 --> 02:02:22,944
She couldn't even write! - What
rubbish are you talking?

1688
02:02:23,212 --> 02:02:24,474
This letter was found
in her hand.

1689
02:02:24,981 --> 02:02:27,506
You are talking rubbish.
Rubbish.

1690
02:02:28,751 --> 02:02:32,847
Your truth which was found
in Urmi's hand... hand...

1691
02:02:33,789 --> 02:02:35,984
...and this hand is
blood-stained.

1692
02:02:36,158 --> 02:02:40,151
And there's not even a drop
of blood on your truth?

1693
02:02:41,197 --> 02:02:43,097
Many such questions will
be raised in the court.

1694
02:02:43,265 --> 02:02:44,425
Many questions.

1695
02:02:45,067 --> 02:02:48,002
And I'll make you write
such a letter too.

1696
02:02:48,437 --> 02:02:49,802
In the court.

1697
02:02:49,939 --> 02:02:54,342
Govind! You're accusing a
responsible police officer!

1698
02:02:55,945 --> 02:02:58,778
You know the meaning of messing
with the police? - I know.

1699
02:02:59,215 --> 02:03:03,379
The police and your police
station too...

1700
02:03:04,186 --> 02:03:08,213
...where many brave soldiers
show their bravery...

1701
02:03:08,557 --> 02:03:10,115
...after tying up a man.

1702
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,327
Kadam, have you ever
gone to a zoo?

1703
02:03:14,497 --> 02:03:16,158
What? - Zoo.

1704
02:03:17,066 --> 02:03:21,127
There, even kids throw peanuts
on a caged lion.

1705
02:03:21,504 --> 02:03:22,562
That's different.

1706
02:03:24,907 --> 02:03:27,205
If you face a lion in a
field, your notions about...

1707
02:03:27,877 --> 02:03:31,438
...being a man will vanish.

1708
02:03:31,814 --> 02:03:34,009
Govind! - Don't shout!

1709
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:37,753
Save your baritone
for the court.

1710
02:03:38,254 --> 02:03:39,983
You've to give many replies.

1711
02:03:40,856 --> 02:03:42,016
Listen.

1712
02:03:43,225 --> 02:03:48,162
Tell Chadda that Govind is
coming to the court again.

1713
02:04:31,907 --> 02:04:35,434
Better than facing me in
court, Govind, let's...

1714
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:39,771
...settle the matter outside.

1715
02:04:41,417 --> 02:04:49,017
You know, Inderjeet Chadda
never accepts defeat.

1716
02:04:51,794 --> 02:04:55,389
Chadda, have you seen kids
taking off a kite...

1717
02:04:55,464 --> 02:04:58,194
...from an electric wire? - What?

1718
02:04:58,801 --> 02:05:03,864
Even kids can take off
kites from some wires!

1719
02:05:04,173 --> 02:05:10,942
It's different that the
wire you've touched...

1720
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:13,814
...by taking up Damini's case
will give you such a shock...

1721
02:05:14,116 --> 02:05:16,482
...that you'll forget
tossing your head!

1722
02:05:18,988 --> 02:05:22,446
You're ruined but are
still arrogant!

1723
02:05:24,193 --> 02:05:27,060
Gupta is willing
to give 400,000.

1724
02:05:28,030 --> 02:05:32,364
It's a big price for
a girl's honor.

1725
02:05:32,535 --> 02:05:34,400
You've progressed a lot, Chadda.

1726
02:05:34,970 --> 02:05:37,996
From being a law broker, you've
started selling honor!

1727
02:05:39,175 --> 02:05:41,905
This profession is called
pimping! - Govind!

1728
02:05:41,977 --> 02:05:46,311
Don't shout! Or I'll settle
this case right here!

1729
02:05:47,049 --> 02:05:49,040
Neither a date, nor a hearing!

1730
02:05:49,385 --> 02:05:53,446
Justice right away!
That too instantly!

1731
02:05:56,192 --> 02:05:58,820
Chadda, reason with
him! Tell him!

1732
02:05:59,428 --> 02:06:02,158
Many such toys are sold
in the market.

1733
02:06:02,932 --> 02:06:05,298
But the guts needed
to play with them...

1734
02:06:05,868 --> 02:06:07,995
...isn't sold in any market.

1735
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:10,529
A man is born with it.

1736
02:06:11,874 --> 02:06:15,173
And when this 2.5 kilo hand
falls on someone...

1737
02:06:16,045 --> 02:06:19,310
...he doesn't get up. He dies!

1738
02:06:20,249 --> 02:06:24,549
I'll reply to all this
in court tomorrow.

1739
02:06:24,787 --> 02:06:28,416
And yes, if you do anything
insolent in the court...

1740
02:06:28,791 --> 02:06:30,019
...I'll hit you right there!

1741
02:06:30,359 --> 02:06:32,384
The judge will keep screaming
for order...

1742
02:06:32,461 --> 02:06:34,053
...and you'll keep
getting thrashed!

1743
02:06:34,263 --> 02:06:35,787
Relax...

1744
02:06:59,255 --> 02:07:03,851
Milord, this Damini is a very
cunning and sly woman!

1745
02:07:04,493 --> 02:07:06,324
She was born in poverty.

1746
02:07:06,795 --> 02:07:09,093
But she always dreamt of riches!

1747
02:07:09,431 --> 02:07:11,922
That's why she trapped a decent
boy like Shekhar...

1748
02:07:12,001 --> 02:07:14,162
...with her beauty.

1749
02:07:14,570 --> 02:07:17,869
Actually she was eyeing the
Gupta family's treasure.

1750
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:23,207
And when she couldn't get
it despite her attempts...

1751
02:07:23,512 --> 02:07:25,070
...she was upset!

1752
02:07:25,247 --> 02:07:27,306
She decided to get revenge
from the family...

1753
02:07:27,383 --> 02:07:29,214
...which shattered her dreams.

1754
02:07:29,418 --> 02:07:32,785
And taking advantage of this,
the Gupta family's enemies...

1755
02:07:33,022 --> 02:07:35,252
...bought her with money.

1756
02:07:35,524 --> 02:07:38,288
And they hatched a
big conspiracy.

1757
02:07:38,794 --> 02:07:43,163
They tried to prove that the
rape which happened outside...

1758
02:07:43,232 --> 02:07:46,065
...happened in Mr.
Gupta's house...

1759
02:07:46,135 --> 02:07:50,128
...so that they could ruin
Gupta family's reputation.

1760
02:07:50,439 --> 02:07:51,497
Milord!

1761
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:56,174
Such a slimy, lowly and sly girl
should be punished severely...

1762
02:07:56,412 --> 02:07:59,006
...so that womankind
can learn a lesson!

1763
02:07:59,281 --> 02:08:00,839
That's all, Your Honor!

1764
02:08:07,089 --> 02:08:11,389
Your Honor, Mr. Chadda
has confused me a bit.

1765
02:08:13,262 --> 02:08:15,492
I think he watches too
many Hindi movies!

1766
02:08:15,998 --> 02:08:18,330
Because his case is
like these films.

1767
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,297
There are many stories
entangled in it.

1768
02:08:20,602 --> 02:08:23,400
Last time, Mr. Chadda had said
that Damini is insane.

1769
02:08:23,539 --> 02:08:26,235
And today he's saying
Damini is sly.

1770
02:08:26,308 --> 02:08:30,938
So sly that she can be scheming.
She can conspire, plan.

1771
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:34,880
I think, Milord, a girl who
is insane cannot be sly.

1772
02:08:35,084 --> 02:08:37,814
And if she's so sly,
she can't be insane.

1773
02:08:38,087 --> 02:08:41,284
That's why Milord, I want
that like Damini...

1774
02:08:41,423 --> 02:08:44,415
...Mr. Chadda should also be
sent to the mental asylum...

1775
02:08:44,493 --> 02:08:47,155
For some days. When he's
fine, he can say clearly...

1776
02:08:47,329 --> 02:08:50,457
...whether Damini is
insane or sly.

1777
02:08:50,599 --> 02:08:53,295
So that I can prepare my
defense accordingly.

1778
02:08:53,402 --> 02:08:54,596
That's all, Milord.

1779
02:08:57,306 --> 02:09:00,241
Milord, I've proved that
Damini is a lowly...

1780
02:09:00,309 --> 02:09:04,040
Lowly are those who rape a
woman living with them!

1781
02:09:04,246 --> 02:09:07,909
Those who kill a helpless
woman in hospital are lowly!

1782
02:09:07,983 --> 02:09:10,611
That girl was not raped
in Mr. Gupta's house!

1783
02:09:10,853 --> 02:09:12,320
And neither was she killed!

1784
02:09:12,388 --> 02:09:13,946
She has committed suicide!

1785
02:09:14,022 --> 02:09:16,115
And I've presented my
witnesses for that!

1786
02:09:16,191 --> 02:09:18,819
I'd like to question those
very witnesses, Milord!

1787
02:09:19,962 --> 02:09:21,156
Permission granted.

1788
02:09:26,402 --> 02:09:28,768
You're working with Mr. Gupta
since 10 years. - Yes, sir.

1789
02:09:28,837 --> 02:09:30,566
So you're his loyal one. - Yes.

1790
02:09:30,806 --> 02:09:31,898
You're honest. - Yes.

1791
02:09:31,974 --> 02:09:33,339
He has full faith in you. - Yes.

1792
02:09:33,475 --> 02:09:35,204
You look after the
cars too. - Yes.

1793
02:09:35,277 --> 02:09:37,336
Like repairs, filling
petrol. - Yes.

1794
02:09:37,579 --> 02:09:38,978
Everything... - It's
my responsibility.

1795
02:09:39,047 --> 02:09:41,481
When those four boys took Urmi...

1796
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:44,451
Mr. Chadda, pay attention.

1797
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:49,122
When those four took her,
they must be worried. - Yes.

1798
02:09:49,191 --> 02:09:51,421
They must've looked for you,
for the car, keys. - No, sir.

1799
02:09:51,493 --> 02:09:54,519
The Gypsy's car... the Gypsy's
keys aren't with me, sir.

1800
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:56,793
How do you know they
went in a Gypsy?

1801
02:10:03,038 --> 02:10:06,974
No, sir. I came to know later.

1802
02:10:07,242 --> 02:10:10,609
So you came to know later
about the rape.

1803
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:13,138
Point to be noted, Milord.

1804
02:10:13,315 --> 02:10:14,907
Okay Mangesh, you go. - Ok.

1805
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:16,808
Bloody fool! - Mangesh!

1806
02:10:16,885 --> 02:10:21,584
Yes? - Mr. Chadda you'd like
to scold Mangesh? - What?

1807
02:10:22,124 --> 02:10:24,456
You were muttering so I thought
you wanted to ask something.

1808
02:10:24,593 --> 02:10:26,891
No. - Yes, Mr. Kadam.

1809
02:10:27,229 --> 02:10:29,925
Urmi mustn't have slit her
throat with a letter hand.

1810
02:10:30,332 --> 02:10:33,096
And she couldn't hold the letter
after slitting her throat.

1811
02:10:33,769 --> 02:10:36,260
So it means someone else
kept the letter.

1812
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:39,567
That... - What?

1813
02:10:44,112 --> 02:10:47,104
Mr. Chadda, do you understand
this language?

1814
02:10:47,916 --> 02:10:49,907
You can't hear anything anyway.

1815
02:10:50,285 --> 02:10:53,448
Milord, the biggest thing is
that Urmi couldn't write.

1816
02:10:53,956 --> 02:10:57,153
Her ration card isn't signed
but has a thumb impression.

1817
02:10:57,826 --> 02:11:00,886
And Urmi's killers perhaps
didn't know this.

1818
02:11:01,096 --> 02:11:03,826
Just as Mr. Kadam and Mr.
Chadda don't know.

1819
02:11:04,066 --> 02:11:05,863
Yes, Mr. Chadda, am I wrong?

1820
02:11:08,203 --> 02:11:12,299
Your Honor, now I'd like to call
Damini's husband, Shekhar Gupta.

1821
02:11:12,841 --> 02:11:13,933
Permission granted.

1822
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:38,099
Say I'll speak only the truth.
- I'll speak only the truth.

1823
02:11:51,046 --> 02:11:54,345
Mr. Shekhar, do you
love your wife?

1824
02:11:55,584 --> 02:11:58,280
I don't want to reply to
such a silly question.

1825
02:11:58,453 --> 02:12:02,389
Amazing. Milord, I've asked
a straight question.

1826
02:12:02,858 --> 02:12:05,224
Does a husband love
her wife or not?

1827
02:12:05,494 --> 02:12:08,224
Mr. Chadda did I ask
something wrong? No.

1828
02:12:08,597 --> 02:12:11,088
Tell me, do you or
don't you? - Yes.

1829
02:12:12,901 --> 02:12:16,200
What did you say? Mr. Chadda,
did you hear? No.

1830
02:12:17,205 --> 02:12:20,003
Look, Mr. Chadda and I
are short of hearing.

1831
02:12:20,075 --> 02:12:21,269
Speak louder, please.

1832
02:12:22,244 --> 02:12:24,235
Yes, I do.

1833
02:12:25,914 --> 02:12:27,142
Not with lowered eyes.

1834
02:12:27,282 --> 02:12:30,945
Look at your wife and say
do you love her or not?

1835
02:12:35,557 --> 02:12:37,491
This is a question of
a woman's trust.

1836
02:12:37,559 --> 02:12:39,754
I do, a lot.

1837
02:12:42,464 --> 02:12:47,902
Milord, Mr. Shekhar loves his
wife... sorry... Ioves her a lot.

1838
02:12:48,003 --> 02:12:50,801
I've heard that, so has Mr.
Chadda and all of us.

1839
02:12:51,106 --> 02:12:53,404
It's another thing that he
could've said it with a smile.

1840
02:12:54,376 --> 02:13:00,372
Mr. Shekhar, I'm surprised that
you love a girl who is...

1841
02:13:00,882 --> 02:13:03,112
...hot-headed, insane.

1842
02:13:03,485 --> 02:13:06,852
You love a girl who insults
your parents.

1843
02:13:07,222 --> 02:13:10,783
You love a girl who has ruined
your family's peace...

1844
02:13:10,859 --> 02:13:13,157
...and who loves not you
but your wealth.

1845
02:13:13,462 --> 02:13:15,987
A woman who has destroyed
the Gupta family's...

1846
02:13:16,064 --> 02:13:18,430
What are you saying? You say
whatever you feel like?

1847
02:13:19,501 --> 02:13:20,559
I'm not saying this.

1848
02:13:20,836 --> 02:13:23,430
Your able lawyer, Mr. Chadda
and your family...

1849
02:13:23,572 --> 02:13:24,869
...accused Damini of all this.

1850
02:13:25,007 --> 02:13:26,372
Am I wrong? No, right?

1851
02:13:27,109 --> 02:13:29,441
Forget it. Even I know
they're lying.

1852
02:13:29,911 --> 02:13:32,402
Mr. Shekhar, tell me...

1853
02:13:32,481 --> 02:13:35,314
...on Holi, when your scared
wife came to you...

1854
02:13:35,484 --> 02:13:38,976
...and took you to the terrace,
where you saw Urmi being raped...

1855
02:13:39,054 --> 02:13:40,817
...Mr. Chadda, please
pay attention...

1856
02:13:41,289 --> 02:13:42,483
...what did you do?

1857
02:13:50,465 --> 02:13:52,160
Nothing like that
happened. - What?

1858
02:13:52,534 --> 02:13:54,195
That means Damini is lying.

1859
02:13:54,436 --> 02:13:55,562
I didn't say that.

1860
02:13:56,571 --> 02:13:57,833
What did you say?

1861
02:13:58,106 --> 02:14:00,802
Damini says the rape took
place, you say it didn't.

1862
02:14:01,043 --> 02:14:02,203
So Damini is lying.

1863
02:14:02,344 --> 02:14:03,504
Why is she lying?

1864
02:14:04,112 --> 02:14:07,275
Now why is she... nothing
like that happened.

1865
02:14:07,349 --> 02:14:08,407
I say, nothing happened.

1866
02:14:08,483 --> 02:14:10,815
That means Damini
is insane. - No!

1867
02:14:11,219 --> 02:14:13,585
Mr. Chadda, I'm sorry.
You're right.

1868
02:14:13,822 --> 02:14:16,450
Damini is hot-headed, lowly,
a woman who has been sold!

1869
02:14:16,558 --> 02:14:19,118
Shut up! Stop this bloody
nonsense! - I am talking sense!

1870
02:14:19,194 --> 02:14:21,025
Stop it! Stop it! - Mr. Govind.

1871
02:14:21,363 --> 02:14:23,456
Mr. Govind, come
here. Come here.

1872
02:14:26,935 --> 02:14:29,165
You don't have the right to talk
to my husband like this!

1873
02:14:30,138 --> 02:14:33,471
Whether he testifies for me or
against me, it's his wish.

1874
02:14:34,276 --> 02:14:35,937
But I can't tolerate his...

1875
02:14:36,511 --> 02:14:39,002
Please don't embarrass
him in the court!

1876
02:14:39,481 --> 02:14:40,743
Let him go.

1877
02:14:40,916 --> 02:14:42,406
Who do you think you are?

1878
02:14:42,818 --> 02:14:44,115
Who do you think you are? - What?

1879
02:14:44,186 --> 02:14:45,949
Am I your slave? Servant?

1880
02:14:46,188 --> 02:14:47,815
Have you bought me?

1881
02:14:48,023 --> 02:14:51,390
I won't let a lowly woman like
you come close to me! - Govind!

1882
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:54,225
One more word to my wife and...

1883
02:14:56,164 --> 02:14:57,222
Sorry, Damini.

1884
02:14:57,332 --> 02:14:59,300
Milord, did you see?

1885
02:14:59,434 --> 02:15:02,062
When I say something to the
husband, the wife is upset.

1886
02:15:02,237 --> 02:15:04,501
When I say something to the
wife, the husband screams.

1887
02:15:05,006 --> 02:15:09,033
It proves that they love
each other deeply.

1888
02:15:09,177 --> 02:15:12,476
Even in this delicate moment,
it's like a rock!

1889
02:15:13,315 --> 02:15:16,250
Despite the fact that
Damini has accused...

1890
02:15:16,518 --> 02:15:18,213
...Shekhar's younger
brother of rape.

1891
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:22,513
Although Damini has pulled
his family to court...

1892
02:15:22,858 --> 02:15:27,318
...Shekhar can't hear a
word against Damini.

1893
02:15:27,496 --> 02:15:30,988
Because he knows what Damini
is doing is right.

1894
02:15:31,233 --> 02:15:33,167
What she's saying is the truth.

1895
02:15:33,435 --> 02:15:37,895
And now I want to hear that
truth from Mr. Shekhar.

1896
02:15:39,374 --> 02:15:43,174
Mr. Shekhar, now I won't
ask you any questions.

1897
02:15:43,879 --> 02:15:45,244
I'm quitting this case.

1898
02:15:45,914 --> 02:15:49,111
Because Damini doesn't
need me but you.

1899
02:15:49,518 --> 02:15:52,214
She's your wife. You are
everything to her.

1900
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:54,911
So you have to take a decision.

1901
02:15:55,257 --> 02:15:57,782
Will you get your innocent
wife punished...

1902
02:15:57,993 --> 02:16:01,394
...to save those four criminals?

1903
02:16:02,397 --> 02:16:05,332
You have to decide. You.

1904
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:12,570
Milord! I don't understand
anything!

1905
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,872
What does he want to
prove by showing...

1906
02:16:14,943 --> 02:16:16,308
...husband and wife's deep love?

1907
02:16:16,378 --> 02:16:17,811
He should be ashamed of...

1908
02:16:17,879 --> 02:16:20,313
...hiding behind a woman's
false emotions!

1909
02:16:20,382 --> 02:16:23,374
Shut up, law broker! - Shut
up, you lowly lawyer!

1910
02:16:27,122 --> 02:16:29,090
Order! Order! Order!

1911
02:16:50,779 --> 02:16:54,875
Milord! Suddenly I'm not well...

1912
02:16:57,118 --> 02:16:59,848
I request the court to...

1913
02:17:00,055 --> 02:17:04,116
...give some other date, sir.

1914
02:17:04,326 --> 02:17:08,319
Due to Mr. Chadda's illness,
this case is adjourned.

1915
02:17:08,496 --> 02:17:11,488
Its next date will
be fixed later.

1916
02:18:30,845 --> 02:18:34,508
Now this fight isn't between
us and Damini, Mr. Gupta.

1917
02:18:35,216 --> 02:18:39,585
On one side are those who've
been bearing atrocities.

1918
02:18:39,988 --> 02:18:41,546
And we are on the other side.

1919
02:18:42,023 --> 02:18:44,389
By uniting with the common man...

1920
02:18:44,526 --> 02:18:46,994
...Damini has gained
a lot of power.

1921
02:18:47,595 --> 02:18:50,962
And now there's only
one way out of this.

1922
02:18:51,466 --> 02:18:52,865
Only one way.

1923
02:18:53,969 --> 02:18:57,268
Just as Urmi's murder was
turned into a suicide...

1924
02:18:58,006 --> 02:19:01,373
...Damini's death should be
turned into a road accident.

1925
02:19:03,611 --> 02:19:11,279
We'll have to douse her fire
of truth with her own blood.

1926
02:19:14,923 --> 02:19:16,083
Good!

1927
02:19:18,126 --> 02:19:20,458
A woman whose integrity
you couldn't buy...

1928
02:19:21,863 --> 02:19:23,888
...against whose goodness
you couldn't fight...

1929
02:19:25,133 --> 02:19:27,328
...whose trust you
couldn't break...

1930
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:33,830
...by killing her, you're nicely
proving your manhood.

1931
02:19:33,975 --> 02:19:35,408
Stop this rubbish!

1932
02:19:36,911 --> 02:19:38,811
The whole city is mocking at us!

1933
02:19:39,247 --> 02:19:42,444
People are abusing us on the
streets! You know, don't you?

1934
02:19:44,119 --> 02:19:46,815
Now there's only one way
to save our honor.

1935
02:19:46,955 --> 02:19:49,788
Honor? What honor, father?

1936
02:19:50,158 --> 02:19:53,184
The one in whose house an
innocent girl was raped...

1937
02:19:53,294 --> 02:19:54,454
...is talking of honor?

1938
02:19:55,296 --> 02:19:59,858
The one who gets the girl killed
in hospital is talking of honor?

1939
02:20:00,935 --> 02:20:02,527
The one who thinks of killing
his daughter-in-law...

1940
02:20:02,937 --> 02:20:05,303
...because she's honest,
is thinking of honor?

1941
02:20:05,607 --> 02:20:08,132
Where's the honor? Where's
that honor?

1942
02:20:10,311 --> 02:20:13,007
Rather than living with this,
it's better to die in shame!

1943
02:20:14,382 --> 02:20:15,940
To hide one crime...

1944
02:20:16,084 --> 02:20:18,917
...how many crimes will you
commit, father? How many?

1945
02:20:20,288 --> 02:20:24,384
You don't know, father,
how far you've stooped!

1946
02:20:25,894 --> 02:20:27,885
Today I'm proud that I'm
Damini's husband.

1947
02:20:28,897 --> 02:20:31,957
But I'm ashamed to say that
I'm Kedarnath Gupta's son!

1948
02:20:32,333 --> 02:20:33,994
Don't touch me!

1949
02:20:34,335 --> 02:20:35,461
Don't touch me!

1950
02:20:38,073 --> 02:20:41,565
With your father you...
- Enough! Enough!

1951
02:20:42,177 --> 02:20:44,077
I feel like stopping your
breath right here!

1952
02:20:45,947 --> 02:20:48,848
But I won't be able
to kill anyone.

1953
02:20:49,050 --> 02:20:51,075
But I will regret it!

1954
02:20:56,157 --> 02:21:00,890
And yes! I'll support Damini!
Do what you can!

1955
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:05,024
Damini will win! Damini!

1956
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:06,493
This is our Shekhar! - Shekhar!

1957
02:22:07,262 --> 02:22:09,321
Where are you going? We'll
miss our train. Sit. Move.

1958
02:22:09,797 --> 02:22:13,995
Even a street dog helps in such
times. This is our Shekhar.

1959
02:22:20,808 --> 02:22:22,366
Driver! Follow the car!

1960
02:22:25,346 --> 02:22:29,476
Tinu, no one should know Damini
is at your place. - Okay.

1961
02:22:29,817 --> 02:22:32,809
Bring Damini to the court from
the backside, carefully.

1962
02:22:33,321 --> 02:22:34,879
I could be attacked.

1963
02:22:35,123 --> 02:22:37,091
But it's important for Damini
to reach the court.

1964
02:22:37,192 --> 02:22:39,023
You don't worry, she's
like my sister.

1965
02:24:30,772 --> 02:24:32,364
Govind survived!

1966
02:24:35,543 --> 02:24:39,172
Damini shouldn't reach
court tomorrow!

1967
02:24:40,214 --> 02:24:42,079
I'll stop her!

1968
02:24:43,418 --> 02:24:46,910
I'll take the next date.

1969
02:24:47,522 --> 02:24:50,150
And before that date...

1970
02:24:56,831 --> 02:25:01,359
Milord, Damini is a very sly
and intelligent girl.

1971
02:25:02,203 --> 02:25:06,572
By now she knows she'll
be exposed.

1972
02:25:06,908 --> 02:25:08,068
She has fled.

1973
02:25:08,242 --> 02:25:10,938
Now only the police
can bring her here.

1974
02:25:11,279 --> 02:25:13,304
Let's wait for that
day, Milord...

1975
02:25:13,448 --> 02:25:16,474
...and the next date should
be given. - Your Honor!

1976
02:25:17,051 --> 02:25:19,781
I'm sure someone is
stopping her from coming.

1977
02:25:20,455 --> 02:25:22,787
But I'm sure that
she'll come here.

1978
02:25:23,291 --> 02:25:25,555
Because many people have
hopes from her.

1979
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,291
Our blessings are with her.

1980
02:25:27,462 --> 02:25:29,453
She'll surely come,
Milord. Surely.

1981
02:25:31,065 --> 02:25:32,896
Tinu, go fast.

1982
02:25:50,485 --> 02:25:51,543
Go, Yadav!

1983
02:26:13,374 --> 02:26:14,932
This is height of waiting.

1984
02:26:15,143 --> 02:26:17,008
Now the next date
should be given.

1985
02:26:18,479 --> 02:26:19,537
Milord!

1986
02:26:19,781 --> 02:26:22,545
Before you give the date,
I want to say something.

1987
02:26:23,184 --> 02:26:24,310
Permission granted.

1988
02:26:24,385 --> 02:26:27,149
In the first date, it was said
that Damini is insane.

1989
02:26:27,522 --> 02:26:29,251
She was sent to the
mental asylum...

1990
02:26:29,757 --> 02:26:32,487
...where attempts were made
to drive her insane.

1991
02:26:33,895 --> 02:26:35,419
Before the next date...

1992
02:26:35,997 --> 02:26:38,522
...Urmi was murdered
in the hospital...

1993
02:26:39,033 --> 02:26:41,126
...and it was turned into
a suicide case.

1994
02:26:41,302 --> 02:26:45,500
Though I had proven that
Urmi didn't commit suicide.

1995
02:26:45,807 --> 02:26:46,967
She was murdered.

1996
02:26:47,442 --> 02:26:50,206
That day Sjekhar was about
to speak the truth...

1997
02:26:50,778 --> 02:26:53,076
...but Mr. Chadda again
played his trick.

1998
02:26:54,115 --> 02:26:56,913
Feigning illness,
he took a date.

1999
02:26:57,151 --> 02:26:59,813
Otherwise, Milord, this case
would've been over that day.

2000
02:27:00,455 --> 02:27:02,855
And today, you're giving
a date again.

2001
02:27:03,391 --> 02:27:07,191
Before that date, someone will
crush me under a truck...

2002
02:27:07,261 --> 02:27:09,320
...and it'll be made a
road accident case.

2003
02:27:09,964 --> 02:27:11,329
You will again give a date.

2004
02:27:11,833 --> 02:27:13,095
And before that date...

2005
02:27:13,401 --> 02:27:16,859
...Damini will be driven insane
and sent to the asylum.

2006
02:27:17,238 --> 02:27:20,435
In this way, there'll be no one
to fight for the truth...

2007
02:27:20,975 --> 02:27:22,465
...nor anyone to ask for justice.

2008
02:27:23,010 --> 02:27:24,910
What'll remain is just a date.

2009
02:27:25,112 --> 02:27:26,875
That's what has been
happening, Milord.

2010
02:27:27,014 --> 02:27:29,482
One has got a date after
date, date after date...

2011
02:27:29,817 --> 02:27:34,220
...date after date, date after
date, but no justice, Milord!

2012
02:27:34,489 --> 02:27:38,357
No justice! What one has
got is this date!

2013
02:27:40,061 --> 02:27:42,791
Brokers of law have
used this date...

2014
02:27:42,997 --> 02:27:45,431
...as a weapon against
justice, Milord.

2015
02:27:46,334 --> 02:27:51,567
Between two dates, they sell law
outside the court! Sell it!

2016
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:55,571
Here, witnesses are snatched,
bought and killed!

2017
02:27:56,010 --> 02:27:58,478
And what remains is a date!

2018
02:27:59,547 --> 02:28:03,005
People sell their property to
fight cases for justice.

2019
02:28:03,284 --> 02:28:05,115
What they take away is a date!

2020
02:28:06,287 --> 02:28:10,451
Women have sold jewelry
and nuptial threads for it!

2021
02:28:10,925 --> 02:28:13,086
They also got just a date!

2022
02:28:14,161 --> 02:28:16,129
Doing the rounds of this
court for years...

2023
02:28:16,197 --> 02:28:19,394
...many litigants become history!

2024
02:28:20,034 --> 02:28:23,003
Even they get just a date!

2025
02:28:24,071 --> 02:28:27,438
This case is of the weak and
tormented people of India.

2026
02:28:28,242 --> 02:28:31,006
Today, their eyes on you! You!

2027
02:28:31,546 --> 02:28:35,448
On what you give them today.
Justice or date!

2028
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:40,216
If you can't give them justice,
stop this drama!

2029
02:28:40,555 --> 02:28:42,386
Throw away these boxes!

2030
02:28:42,523 --> 02:28:45,083
Tear and burn these law books...

2031
02:28:45,393 --> 02:28:48,260
...so that others don't get
ruined in this maze of justice!

2032
02:28:48,529 --> 02:28:49,962
So that they don't get ruined!

2033
02:29:10,084 --> 02:29:12,279
Milord! What's happening?

2034
02:29:12,954 --> 02:29:14,581
This is an insult to the court!

2035
02:29:14,956 --> 02:29:16,617
It is contempt of court!

2036
02:29:17,258 --> 02:29:20,193
I say, punish him!

2037
02:29:20,261 --> 02:29:24,061
Punish him right now, quickly!
- Order! Order!

2038
02:29:24,398 --> 02:29:28,926
Mr. Chadda, the court will
decide who should be punished.

2039
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:31,060
Order! Order!

2040
02:29:31,339 --> 02:29:35,537
Until the court reaches a
decision, it won't be adjourned.

2041
02:30:03,871 --> 02:30:08,570
Come! Come, move forward!
Move forward!

2042
02:30:09,343 --> 02:30:11,971
You're man, show your
manhood! Show me!

2043
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:14,177
Move forward!

2044
02:30:15,416 --> 02:30:17,611
Touch me! Touch me! Come!

2045
02:30:18,152 --> 02:30:19,551
Move forward!

2046
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:21,512
Why are you moving back!

2047
02:30:21,922 --> 02:30:24,823
Move ahead! Touch me! Come!

2048
02:30:59,427 --> 02:31:01,793
Milord! I can say with surety...

2049
02:31:02,163 --> 02:31:04,188
...that Damini won't come back!

2050
02:31:04,398 --> 02:31:06,161
Damini will not come
back at all, Milord!

2051
02:31:06,233 --> 02:31:07,894
Damini is here! - Damini is here!

2052
02:31:07,968 --> 02:31:09,367
Damini is here!

2053
02:31:16,143 --> 02:31:17,337
Damini are you alright?

2054
02:31:17,445 --> 02:31:19,310
They were trying to kill
me, Mr. Govind.

2055
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:21,004
I escaped with great difficulty
to come here.

2056
02:31:21,182 --> 02:31:24,242
Milord! I was right!

2057
02:31:24,919 --> 02:31:27,046
There was an attempt
to murder Damini.

2058
02:31:27,922 --> 02:31:29,514
Now the court can understand...

2059
02:31:29,957 --> 02:31:32,050
...who could benefit from
Damini's death.

2060
02:31:32,126 --> 02:31:34,253
Milord why would Gupta
and Bajaj do this?

2061
02:31:34,328 --> 02:31:37,161
Point to be noted, Milord.
I didn't name anybody.

2062
02:31:37,431 --> 02:31:39,558
By naming Mr. Bajaj, Mr.
Chadda has proved that...

2063
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:42,394
...he's also involved in this
conspiracy with Mr. Gupta.

2064
02:31:45,372 --> 02:31:46,862
Order! Order!

2065
02:31:48,509 --> 02:31:51,103
Now I'd like to call
Shekhar Gupta.

2066
02:31:51,178 --> 02:31:54,409
The one whose wife is so crazy,
how can he face anyone?

2067
02:31:54,982 --> 02:31:57,416
The poor guy has fled.
- Impossible, Milord.

2068
02:31:57,485 --> 02:32:00,010
Shekhar can't leave Damini
in this condition.

2069
02:32:00,387 --> 02:32:02,252
I think he's being held
somewhere or to save...

2070
02:32:02,523 --> 02:32:06,516
...the Gupta family's honor,
he has been killed!

2071
02:32:06,594 --> 02:32:09,358
What rubbish are you talking?
- I'm speaking the truth.

2072
02:32:09,430 --> 02:32:11,091
This is impossible, Milord.

2073
02:32:11,499 --> 02:32:14,263
No father will kill
his son. - Why not?

2074
02:32:14,335 --> 02:32:17,498
Those who can try to kill
a daughter-in-law...

2075
02:32:17,571 --> 02:32:20,938
...can also kill their son.

2076
02:32:28,382 --> 02:32:30,942
I don't want justice!

2077
02:32:33,454 --> 02:32:34,944
Hold yourself, Damini!

2078
02:32:35,289 --> 02:32:37,883
The truth will win. We
will get justice.

2079
02:32:37,958 --> 02:32:42,418
Which truth? What justice?
I don't want anything.

2080
02:32:42,830 --> 02:32:44,229
I don't want anything. - Damini...

2081
02:32:44,532 --> 02:32:48,024
Let me speak, Mr. Govind.
Let me speak.

2082
02:32:48,369 --> 02:32:50,428
I've seen and heard a lot.

2083
02:32:51,872 --> 02:32:55,933
They've made Urmi's rape
a business! Business!

2084
02:32:56,544 --> 02:32:58,444
They've made it their
daily bread.

2085
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:02,977
The press has sensationalized
and sold...

2086
02:33:03,050 --> 02:33:04,813
...Urmi's story in installments.

2087
02:33:05,553 --> 02:33:09,353
Her ruin was made a source
of income by the police!

2088
02:33:10,090 --> 02:33:14,186
And the doctor who's considered
another form of God...

2089
02:33:14,962 --> 02:33:18,454
...also fled with the money,
leaving Urmi to die.

2090
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:22,034
These people are worse
than vultures...

2091
02:33:22,436 --> 02:33:24,802
...preying on living people!

2092
02:33:25,206 --> 02:33:27,834
They're hypocrites, cheats,
all of them!

2093
02:33:28,442 --> 02:33:31,502
They dress the Goddess' idol
in silken clothes...

2094
02:33:32,012 --> 02:33:36,005
...and they strip women outside!

2095
02:33:37,117 --> 02:33:39,950
I don't want to prove the
truth to such people.

2096
02:33:40,287 --> 02:33:42,448
I don't want to prove the truth.

2097
02:33:45,292 --> 02:33:50,889
I saw Urmi's rape, tried
to get justice for her...

2098
02:33:51,765 --> 02:33:54,563
...but she was raped in
every nook and corner!

2099
02:33:55,169 --> 02:33:58,104
In the police station
and in the court!

2100
02:33:58,172 --> 02:34:01,471
She was raped again and again!

2101
02:34:03,310 --> 02:34:06,768
Where were the hands,
where were the hands?

2102
02:34:07,915 --> 02:34:10,349
On the hands or shoulders?

2103
02:34:11,285 --> 02:34:13,981
On the waist or thighs?

2104
02:34:15,522 --> 02:34:16,955
How much was she stripped?

2105
02:34:18,092 --> 02:34:20,117
These questions were necessary.

2106
02:34:20,461 --> 02:34:22,452
But how were they put to me?

2107
02:34:22,963 --> 02:34:26,160
And when I was being asked
such filthy questions...

2108
02:34:26,233 --> 02:34:27,825
...why was no voice raised?

2109
02:34:28,335 --> 02:34:29,825
Where were those brother...

2110
02:34:29,970 --> 02:34:32,495
...who move with rakhis (threads)
To protect sisters?

2111
02:34:33,507 --> 02:34:35,873
Why is everyone looking
down today?

2112
02:34:35,976 --> 02:34:37,102
Why?

2113
02:34:37,544 --> 02:34:39,978
That day everyone was
looking at me...

2114
02:34:40,180 --> 02:34:42,341
...when Mr. Chadda
was insulting me.

2115
02:34:44,385 --> 02:34:45,943
Yes, Mr. Chadda.

2116
02:34:48,222 --> 02:34:50,952
The part above the knees
is called thigh.

2117
02:34:51,759 --> 02:34:53,056
Even I know that.

2118
02:34:54,495 --> 02:34:58,454
Now I ask you. Answer
me, Mr. Chadda.

2119
02:34:59,466 --> 02:35:02,435
The part below the neck
is called chest, right?

2120
02:35:03,437 --> 02:35:05,462
You're short of hearing,
Mr. Chadda.

2121
02:35:06,006 --> 02:35:10,306
So I'll shout and say so that
you can hear clearly.

2122
02:35:12,379 --> 02:35:16,907
The part below the neck is
called chest, Mr. Chadda.

2123
02:35:18,152 --> 02:35:22,816
This part gives a person
his identity first.

2124
02:35:24,058 --> 02:35:29,394
Every mother feeds her baby,
holding it to her chest.

2125
02:35:30,497 --> 02:35:32,897
You too must've been
fed, Mr. Chadda.

2126
02:35:33,767 --> 02:35:36,736
Would you have asked your
mother or sister...

2127
02:35:36,804 --> 02:35:40,137
...the kind of questions
you asked me?

2128
02:35:41,375 --> 02:35:43,366
Answer me, Mr. Chadda!

2129
02:35:44,178 --> 02:35:47,204
Look at me and answer me!

2130
02:35:58,525 --> 02:36:03,758
No! I don't want the truth!

2131
02:36:05,466 --> 02:36:09,232
At least Urmi's soul
rest in peace.

2132
02:36:11,538 --> 02:36:14,371
I'm taking this case back.

2133
02:36:15,309 --> 02:36:21,407
Perhaps... perhaps I was insane
that till now all this...

2134
02:36:23,183 --> 02:36:24,309
I am insane.

2135
02:36:25,452 --> 02:36:28,216
Send me to the mental
asylum again, Judge.

2136
02:36:29,223 --> 02:36:30,815
Perhaps, that's where I belong.

2137
02:36:31,058 --> 02:36:32,423
I deserve to be there.

2138
02:36:33,794 --> 02:36:36,957
Forgive me, Shekhar. Forgive me.

2139
02:36:40,134 --> 02:36:41,431
Damini!

2140
02:37:07,394 --> 02:37:10,158
I'm the culprit.

2141
02:37:11,465 --> 02:37:14,332
It is true that Urmi was raped.

2142
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:17,862
I saw it.

2143
02:37:18,138 --> 02:37:21,767
In my house, my brother
and his friends...

2144
02:37:22,376 --> 02:37:24,173
...raped Urmi.

2145
02:37:25,012 --> 02:37:31,815
My family and I hid this.
To save our honor.

2146
02:37:32,019 --> 02:37:35,147
To save our false honor.

2147
02:37:36,423 --> 02:37:39,449
It is also true that
Urmi was murdered.

2148
02:37:40,060 --> 02:37:45,191
In this conspiracy, Mr.
Chadda, Mr. Bajaj...

2149
02:37:45,833 --> 02:37:48,324
...and my father are involved.

2150
02:37:49,503 --> 02:37:53,530
If I've got courage to come
at this shameful moment...

2151
02:37:55,275 --> 02:37:58,836
...if I could fight death and
come, the power behind that...

2152
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:01,279
...is in front of me.

2153
02:38:03,050 --> 02:38:04,244
Damini.

2154
02:38:05,619 --> 02:38:07,143
My wife, Damini.

2155
02:38:08,589 --> 02:38:14,186
I'm proud that Damini
is my wife, Milrod.

2156
02:38:14,461 --> 02:38:17,191
Damini is my wife.

2157
02:38:23,370 --> 02:38:27,170
And I'm proud that
I'm her husband.

2158
02:38:33,881 --> 02:38:35,246
Order! Order!

2159
02:38:36,216 --> 02:38:38,844
After hearing witnesses and
Shekhar's statement...

2160
02:38:38,986 --> 02:38:40,510
...the court concludes that...

2161
02:38:40,954 --> 02:38:46,950
...Rakesh and his three friends,
Mahesh Kalia, Anup Arya...

2162
02:38:47,194 --> 02:38:50,288
...and Bharat Sabharwal be
sentenced to seven years...

2163
02:38:50,464 --> 02:38:52,489
...of rigorous imprisonment each.

2164
02:38:53,033 --> 02:38:57,902
For all in the Gupta family
who tried to hide this crime...

2165
02:38:58,272 --> 02:38:59,830
...two years in jail.

2166
02:39:00,340 --> 02:39:05,004
And Inderjeet Chadda, Kedarnath
Gupta and Tolu Bajaj...

2167
02:39:05,445 --> 02:39:08,437
...are being sentenced to seven
years of rigorous imprisonment...

2168
02:39:08,515 --> 02:39:10,483
...for the murder of Urmi.

2169
02:39:11,418 --> 02:39:14,114
And no proceedings will
be initiated against...

2170
02:39:14,388 --> 02:39:18,984
...Shekhar Gupta who has helped
this court to deliver justice.

2171
02:39:34,208 --> 02:39:35,300
Order! Order!

2172
02:39:36,109 --> 02:39:39,203
Neither I nor this court
deserves this applause.

2173
02:39:40,013 --> 02:39:43,380
I ask those who're upset
with the court.

2174
02:39:43,884 --> 02:39:45,112
Who delivers justice?

2175
02:39:45,786 --> 02:39:48,516
The biggest judge is
your own conscience.

2176
02:39:48,956 --> 02:39:51,789
And there's no court in the
world greater than conscience.

2177
02:39:52,392 --> 02:39:55,361
If someone has proved Gandhi's
statement true...

2178
02:39:55,596 --> 02:39:56,585
...it is Damini.

2179
02:39:57,164 --> 02:39:59,860
The law and the court are
grateful to Damini.

2180
02:40:00,334 --> 02:40:02,825
In the history of law, this
day and this decision...

2181
02:40:03,003 --> 02:40:06,962
...will be known as
Damini's decision.

2182
02:40:07,207 --> 02:40:12,076
Come! In Damini's honor,
together with the court...

2183
02:40:12,212 --> 02:40:16,205
...let's congratulate Damini
with applause.
