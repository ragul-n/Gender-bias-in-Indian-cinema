1
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,170
Bombay - 1993

2
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,814
How are you, brother-in-law?

3
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,357
It's been many days
since I saw you.

4
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,525
How is my sister and children?

5
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,279
They're fine but your sister
is worried about me.

6
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,865
She doesn't want me
to work for mafia.

7
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,867
Time has come to end her worry.

8
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,119
This is my years of hard work, Surya.

9
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,205
This is my investigation file.

10
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,878
Nana Bhai who started his life
of crime from a Hyderabad slum,

11
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,006
now has grown to become a mafia don
to make India shiver,

12
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,216
along with his brothers,
Jeeva and Lala,

13
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,219
with trusted lieutenants
Shakeel, Robert and Guru,

14
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,305
Bombay, Hyderabad,
Bangalore, Calcutta,

15
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,642
with business interests in
land, drugs and illegal weapons,

16
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,978
he has established
a well oiled network,

17
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,063
anybody going against Nana is dead,

18
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,317
he has planned a number of blasts
joining terrorist groups,

19
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,319
Bombay could be the first target,

20
00:03:55,485 --> 00:04:00,157
details of police and politicians
who support them are in this file,

21
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,330
he trusted me more than
his brothers in the gang,

22
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,415
that's why I could collect
so many details,

23
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,627
our newspaper 'Jagruti' must
publish the truth boldly.

24
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:16,673
I'm really proud of your
undercover crime journalism.

25
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,466
Come, let's go to Hyderabad
with family.

26
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,801
No, brother-in-law!

27
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,680
Entering underworld is dangerous and
getting out is more dangerous.

28
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,016
They're planning some big blasts,

29
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,019
I must find the truth and
catch them red handed.

30
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,104
Okay, I'll go now.

31
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,442
Today is Rakhi, will you go
without meeting your sister?

32
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,027
Okay, come.

33
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:37,861
Come.

34
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,792
Mother tied it to her brother,
you tie this to me.

35
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,709
Okay.

36
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,598
First blast must go off
on 12th at noon!

37
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,725
Place is VT station.

38
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,563
Serial blasts must go off at 5 minutes
interval in different areas.

39
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,566
RDX is ready.

40
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,244
Before the blasts go off,

41
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,997
Shakeel and Robert will go to Nepal,

42
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,666
Jeeva and Lala will be in Dubai,

43
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,587
I and Raghu would reach
Malaysia in ship.

44
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,007
Bhai, I need to go to my place.

45
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,717
My mother is sick.

46
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,844
I'm here to inform you.
- Is it?

47
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,346
Okay, you go.

48
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,516
It's mother, you must go.

49
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,273
Be careful!
I can't trust anyone.

50
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,612
Nobody must know about our plan.

51
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:04,907
Okay, bhai.

52
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,623
You trusted him more
than your own brothers.

53
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,667
Betrayer! Will you spare him?

54
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,127
He's a journalist,

55
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,797
I'm sure he would've
hidden proofs in house.

56
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,219
He, his family and those proofs,
nothing must remain.

57
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:29,806
What's it? What happened?

58
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,767
Your brother has sold off our lives.

59
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,728
The file I prepared years working
as undercover journalist,

60
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,146
he sold the file to Nana Bhai.

61
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,315
We must leave the
place immediately.

62
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,067
Get ready quickly.

63
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,041
Raja, listen to me carefully,

64
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,586
I was supporting good cause
by staying with bad guys.

65
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,089
I lived for this country,

66
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,424
Nana bhai's complete
life of crime is in this,

67
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,181
you're the protector of
mother and sister.

68
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,518
I don't get what you say, father.

69
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,444
What's this, hubby?

70
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,364
Kill or die for public cause!

71
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,365
Go with children.
- No...

72
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,868
Go!- Come.
- Quickly.

73
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,097
What happened, Raja?

74
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,518
The cassette father gave me...
I'll be back in a minute, mother.

75
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,853
Brother!

76
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:21,668
Father!

77
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,463
Why did you come back?
Go away son!

78
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,257
Father!
- Go!

79
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,432
Bhai, his wife and children escaped.

80
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,856
Father...father...

81
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,151
No...no...father...

82
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:50,364
Trying to betray me
gaining my trust.

83
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,698
Father!

84
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,035
No...no...

85
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,453
No!

86
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,557
Publish these proofs!

87
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,560
It seems your father
gave you something.

88
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,645
Where is it?

89
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,321
Look, he's there!

90
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,250
catch him!

91
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,940
Brother!

92
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,777
Mother, catch it!

93
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,588
Did you see an old man
with four kids?

94
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,048
Tell me I say!

95
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,015
My sister!

96
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,270
Hey old man! Come out!

97
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,203
What have you done, child?

98
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:44,913
Throw that thing!

99
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:53,213
Son, I'm an ordinary mechanic.

100
00:11:54,423 --> 00:12:01,096
They're orphans who lost parents
in the recent bomb blasts.

101
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,182
Allah has sent you to me.

102
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,808
Where are your parents, son?

103
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,727
They killed!

104
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,563
They killed my mother,
father and sister.

105
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,481
Nana bhai and his gang.

106
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,319
Devil!

107
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,492
Not just your parents,
he killed 300 people in Bombay.

108
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,746
He set off bombs and
escaped from India.

109
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,082
Allah will punish him.

110
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,586
No, I'll punish them.

111
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,174
I'll not leave them.

112
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,759
I'll not leave anyone.

113
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,513
I swear on Allah the great,

114
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:48,852
I'll raise you to kill them
with your hands!

115
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,782
Present day - 2013
Hyderabad

116
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,964
Emergency meeting has been called to
discuss about a dangerous situation.

117
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,052
You know about a blast in
a housing complex in Hyderabad.

118
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,887
RDX was used in it.

119
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:28,141
The blast wasn't planned,
it happened accidentally.

120
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:33,063
but to our luck we got
100 kgs of RDX in the next flat.

121
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,817
We've come to know about plan
of serial blasts in Hyderabad.

122
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,903
Records of call from mobiles
we found on site,

123
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,531
we know Robert and Shakeel,

124
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,659
Nana bhai's lieutenants were
coordinating from Malaysia,

125
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:50,330
in today's blast all died
except Guru bhai.

126
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's interrogate and
get details from him, sir.

127
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:57,671
Bad luck, Guru bhai died
an hour ago in hospital.

128
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,423
We lost the lone witness.

129
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,260
Actually, I took big risk, sir.

130
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,511
That's why we're paying you, right?

131
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,848
You can bring back the dead
with money in India.

132
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,107
Nobody can stop the blasts now.

133
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,779
Robert, Shakeel, Nana Bhai
and his brothers,

134
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,948
I'll come back to Hyderabad
with anyone of them.

135
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,368
I'll talk to Malaysian police.

136
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,456
Keep this operation secret
till blasts stop.

137
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,593
We've information about
Shakeel coming to Kualalampur.

138
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,762
We're in Malaysia for 5 years now.

139
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,473
First time we've information
about Nana bhai.

140
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,061
To bring out the snake from pit,
you need to smoke it.

141
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,746
Bhai, he's inquiring about you
and Robert near our hideouts.

142
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,337
Who are you guys?
Why are you inquiring about us?

143
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,338
Are you informers?

144
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,262
You swine!

145
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:37,688
Think before you hit anyone,
who would come in support of him!

146
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,904
If I beat you, who will come?

147
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,614
Who will come?
Who will come?

148
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,410
The less you know about him
the better for you.

149
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,870
Shut up, you bloody!

150
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,589
Pray God that he mustn't
know your address.

151
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,717
If not you're dead.

152
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,802
You...

153
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,727
I'm beating you in Subhan hanger.
So what?

154
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,020
Would he come?

155
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,147
Tell him to come.
Who are you?

156
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,574
It's a mystery who am I!

157
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,203
What I create is history!

158
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,038
All of you would see my victory!

159
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,670
I told you if he knows
your address, you're dead!

160
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,713
Who are you?

161
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:53,569
Is he Sun's shadow on earth?

162
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:03,745
Will he end the crime
with his third eye?

163
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,107
Nobody can take on him,
he'll never back off...

164
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,362
Is he heir of death?
Who is he?

165
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,617
You can never find him,
if he finds you, it's death...

166
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:27,955
Is he thunder?
Is he snake hood?

167
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:32,876
Is he trouble?
Is he a battlefield?

168
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:38,632
Is he fate? Is he the end?

169
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:48,308
Is he the ultimate danger?

170
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:54,875
You are...?

171
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,630
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

172
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,508
Give me details of Nana's gang.

173
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,801
I want full reports about
their dealings.

174
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,304
Someone is targeting the mafia, sir.

175
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,306
He has already killed Shakeel.

176
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:10,724
Next is Robert...

177
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:15,562
I want special report on Nana's gang,
it's activities and hideouts

178
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,191
I must get complete information
about the gang come directly to me.

179
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,567
Issue them toll free numbers.

180
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,819
Robert is finished, sir.

181
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,910
Abdul, take passports.

182
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,329
Enter Hyderabad like students,

183
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,415
since Guru failed in his plan,

184
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,042
so, I'm sending you
to Hyderabad.

185
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:41,755
Bombs must go off
as planned in October.

186
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,174
We don't know who killed Shakeel.

187
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,343
We must be very careful.

188
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:12,286
What shall we do with the police
officer who arrested Robert?

189
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,247
It's not important to
kill police officer.

190
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:18,375
It's more important
to get Robert out.

191
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:22,963
I don't know whether you blast
the station or buy police officers,

192
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,968
Robert must be out before
Nana bhai comes to know this.

193
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,637
A bad news.

194
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:35,475
Special police team from has
arrested your next target Robert.

195
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,228
He has been lodged in
high security jail,

196
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,856
tomorrow they're shifting
him to Hyderabad.

197
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:43,859
He must go out of Malaysia.

198
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,862
Sir, we've arrested Robert.

199
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,406
He's very helpful in
red October case.

200
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,074
We're bringing him tomorrow
morning in a special flight, sir.

201
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:57,456
Someone has killed Shakeel
and targeting Nana's gang.

202
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,753
Looks like our team would
lose this match.

203
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,046
Who is this drunkard?

204
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:06,340
He was creating nuisance
after getting drunk, sir.

205
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,307
Not here, put him in cell.

206
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,017
Get your hangover in cellar.

207
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,021
Why is he kissing me?

208
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,690
Our guy has caught a catch.

209
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,573
One more catch!

210
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,699
This is right.

211
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:45,546
It's our batting now,
we'll thrash them!

212
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,801
It isn't as easy to kill Robert in cell
as you killed Shakeel.

213
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,636
Security is tight,

214
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:55,138
we're taking him back to India
by morning, right?

215
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,558
What if they plan his kill tonight?

216
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,438
Who are you?

217
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:48,525
I'm Shadow,
the shadow that killed Shakeel!

218
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,611
Who sent you?

219
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:55,115
I'm not here anyone's order,
I'm here to kill you.

220
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,205
You lost an eye because of me!

221
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,126
I had decided as a young boy,
I'll not spare Nana and his gang.

222
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,131
You? Raghuram's son?

223
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:12,883
Yes!

224
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:34,988
Where is Nana bhai?

225
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:38,033
Nana bhai is in Malaysian seawaters.

226
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,368
You can't bring him to land.

227
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,869
Would he come if you die?

228
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:45,666
Not just come,
he'll devastate Malaysia.

229
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,176
He hit them!

230
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,596
Did anyone come here after I left?

231
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,056
A drunkard was here, sir.

232
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,225
Where is he?
- In the cell, sir.

233
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:14,611
He's our officer, sir.

234
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,764
Who is this officer?

235
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,894
Long hair, that get up,
by any chance, is he the Shadow?

236
00:28:58,739 --> 00:28:59,907
Why is he calculating?

237
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:08,665
Oh my God! Smoke!
May be he's escaping, catch him!

238
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,334
I got him!

239
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,754
I got him, I got Shadow!

240
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,005
Open your eyes.

241
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,767
Continue cooperating like this.

242
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,769
Guessed it right.

243
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,355
Our targets are same!

244
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,607
Nana bhai and his gang.

245
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:37,694
I'll take care of them,
go back to India and take rest.

246
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:43,450
Every criminal is over confident
till he's caught.

247
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,036
I'll catch you.
- You can't touch wind.

248
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,955
You can't hold fire.

249
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:50,123
You can't catch Shadow.

250
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,380
My friend called from Lankavi island,

251
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:59,883
he's sending full details of
Nana bhai through an air hostess.

252
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,220
How to recognise her?
- She'll recognise you.

253
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,055
Who is coming sir?

254
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:08,475
You'd have seen Dubai Seenu
and Don Seenu,

255
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:09,560
but one coming is Psycho Seenu!

256
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,395
Psycho Seenu?
- Yes.

257
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:19,653
I saw his photo,
he looked like a lizard on land.

258
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:27,578
You both would become great
psychologists by carrying my luggage.

259
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:28,745
Stop!

260
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:31,748
Where's Madhubala?

261
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,683
I told you to follow me closely,
where did you go away, Bala?

262
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,436
My brother told me to call
on reaching here.

263
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,854
I went to make a call.

264
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,191
Won't I offer my cell if you ask?
What did your brother say?

265
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,277
It seems a prospective groom
is coming here to meet me.

266
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:04,615
It seems he likes me very much
and has a great surprize for me.

267
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:08,869
We're here for medical conference
not for match making.

268
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:11,705
My brother arranged this
without my knowledge...

269
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,292
Look, you all are house surgeons
only if I give you pass marks.

270
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,960
If not you'd stay in
your own house only.

271
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:21,507
Life will become hell if you
marry family's choices.

272
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,718
Look at me! I'm in this position
because I didn't think about marriage.

273
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,178
It's waste to think
about it now, sir.

274
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,930
I don't like girls so easily.

275
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,723
Nobody would like you too
so easily, sir.

276
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,562
You can meet him but tell
your brother he's very ugly.

277
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,400
Oh my red jacket!

278
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:45,906
The man in suit which doesn't
suit him is Psycho Seenu.

279
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,407
Greetings sir.

280
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:51,245
Give the bouquet! He's Psycho!

281
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,664
I mean Seenu!

282
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,378
Your name?
- Kamma Reddy.

283
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:00,587
I don't want your caste name.

284
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,841
Kamma Reddy Kapu Raju,
that's my full name.

285
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,261
Don't get shocked,
my father was a modern man.

286
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,846
My mother too was
modern thinking woman.

287
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,180
I'm very orthodox.

288
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:12,099
I'm a terrorist.
Be careful with me.

289
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,768
Not even a retired terrorist
would be like this, come.

290
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,939
Be careful, pen drive is
very important to us.

291
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,316
Place is full of police.

292
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:22,442
Come.

293
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,653
We were happy in stations,

294
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,990
with Shadow's entry
we're on roads!

295
00:32:28,157 --> 00:32:29,867
We must catch Shadow
at any cost, sir.

296
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:34,288
How can we catch him?
Is he going near us to catch?

297
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:39,877
sir, look at him!
He looks exactly like him, sir.

298
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:41,670
He's walking too fast.

299
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:42,963
Do you think that's him?

300
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,132
Come, let's chase him.

301
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:55,142
Where's my red jacket?

302
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,061
What's his name?

303
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,397
You never met him,
how will you recognise him?

304
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:04,026
His name is Sanyasi Naidu and
he'll come in a red jacket.

305
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,069
It seems he has a surprize for me.

306
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,322
Sanyasi? Very bad name.

307
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:09,990
I'm sure he won't be good to look.

308
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:18,415
You're wrong,
Sanyasi is rocking!

309
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:24,379
He's great!

310
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,760
Give me what you have for me.

311
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,596
You said you've something for me.

312
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,181
It was decided you would give.

313
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,267
You wanted to give something.

314
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,354
You're confused,
give me what you've for me.

315
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:41,855
That is surprize...

316
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,526
Either give or take,
finish it quickly.

317
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:49,196
His height and hair are
just the same.

318
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,031
He perfectly matches him.

319
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:56,411
What's this?

320
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:04,378
They're kissing each other.

321
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:07,881
They're lovers, mad man! Come.

322
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,384
That killer and this kisser
are not same.

323
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,135
It's common in Malaysia.

324
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,805
Raja, she has given the pen drive!

325
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,307
Are you okay?
- How could he kiss her?

326
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:18,141
Move.

327
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,394
Who is he?
- He's going away...

328
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,396
I'm hurt.

329
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,147
You said someone would come
and has a surprize for you,

330
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:24,897
is this the surprize?

331
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:25,816
As I watch!

332
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:27,568
How is it, dear?

333
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,488
First time, right? She can put
on lip stick again, come.

334
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,368
Are you coming to Hyderabad
or settle down in Malaysia?

335
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:39,580
I'll come but
did you go to hospital?

336
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:40,831
When is it due?

337
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:44,251
It's still 6 months away,
I've fantastic good news for you.

338
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,002
What's it?

339
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:49,422
I gave your address to our neighbour
Psycho Seenu on visit to Kualalampur.

340
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,841
Why did you give my
address to Psycho Seenu?

341
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,012
I didn't give,
he tortured me and got it.

342
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,721
Madhubala and others
too are coming.

343
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,601
They're okay to me.
Can't bear him as neighbour,

344
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,060
if he comes here,
he'll do my post mortem alive.

345
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:06,440
Looks like you're talking about me.

346
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,983
Bindu gave the good news
about your arrival.

347
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,359
Welcome, he's here.

348
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:11,778
Here's Bindu.

349
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:17,159
Seenu finished the snacks
you sent for Pratap.

350
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,994
He's eating snacks too
along with brains.

351
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,497
I ate only snacks but
someone ate her lips.

352
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,248
You can't do anything
with lips, right?

353
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,293
Flat is very good,
it can accommodate all of us.

354
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,128
If it's free he'll adjust
without AC also.

355
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,796
Why are you sad as
if the fault is yours?

356
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,049
I've lost my commission.

357
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:37,971
It's your wish where to take us
out for lunches, dinners and tours.

358
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,681
He has planned a free trip
to Malaysia.

359
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,726
You freshen up first.
- Madhu, you too.

360
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,562
Where's your room?
- There!

361
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:03,580
You would've heard that
I play with dead bodies.

362
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,415
But now you will watch it.

363
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,174
Find that doctor girl,
I must say sorry to her.

364
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:15,592
Okay, come.

365
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:19,930
My brother.

366
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:25,102
Yes, brother! I'm in a demo.

367
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,855
It seems Sanyasi was there
and something had happened.

368
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,732
Sanyasi?
I met him in airport.

369
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,569
Did he meet you?
He said he didn't.

370
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:34,903
In a red jacket.

371
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,031
Okay, he likes you so much.

372
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,117
He'll come, meet him once.

373
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:43,620
Can't meet him today, brother.

374
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:57,968
Will he kiss me again?

375
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,471
That is...

376
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,728
He looks like an undertaker.

377
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:10,898
I go crazy on seeing dead bodies.

378
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:13,567
He's here again.

379
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:15,402
Tell me.

380
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,406
Why is he here? Red jacket
that day, white coat now.

381
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:20,407
May be he's a doctor.

382
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,076
He's an actor not a doctor.

383
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:27,581
You're in a coat,
you too are a doctor.

384
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:28,832
Why are you inviting trouble?

385
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:33,420
I'll make him fall at my feet
with all my experience.

386
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:39,384
It's not as easy as to kiss
to deal with dead bodies.

387
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,428
He would die in fear.

388
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,351
No problem!

389
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,102
Dead body is better than him.

390
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:52,147
Why is he so fearsome?

391
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,775
I'm scared even after seeing
thousands of bodies.

392
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,193
Endure it.

393
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:58,695
Can you tell it's a murder case?

394
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,783
Do it fast and
hand over the body to us.

395
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,493
He's a dangerous gangster.

396
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,119
He's the lone dead man
this week, what can we do?

397
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:10,374
It's a murder case.
Killer murdered him with vengeance.

398
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,210
Seeing the wounds, examining it,

399
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:16,922
can you tell exactly
what's in my report?

400
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:20,133
Can you tell where did the
first bullet hit him?

401
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,969
My foot he can tell.
- No way.

402
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:27,140
He wasn't hit by bullet first.
He got punched first.

403
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:34,857
Three bullets pierced into him,
where did the first bullet hit him?

404
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:42,406
Not three, it was four bullets.

405
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,075
First bullet hit his leg,

406
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:49,580
but it isn't in his body,
it pierced through and hit the wall.

407
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,499
Second bullet hit his left rib.

408
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,713
Killer used silencer.

409
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:04,178
Looks like it's his post mortem.

410
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:05,596
What about this wound?

411
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:08,098
Don't worry about the
wound near eye.

412
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:11,143
Why? In the fight,
he would've got hurt.

413
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,521
No, he hurt his eye 20 years ago.

414
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,194
How could you tell so correctly, sir?

415
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:21,612
Claps please!

416
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:26,283
Post mortem is over,
you can take the body.

417
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,453
Do it fast.

418
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,038
Sir, look at him!

419
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,707
I've seen a similar man elsewhere.

420
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:35,209
He's stealing a coat.

421
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,461
I'll not spare you.

422
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:40,130
I'm not a thief, sir.
- Mafia?

423
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:41,298
Are you here for the dead body?

424
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:44,051
My father is Home in Andhra.
- Homo?

425
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:47,387
The girl I wish to marry...
- Some are better informed than us.

426
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,223
He knows!

427
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:50,807
Please come here.

428
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:53,310
Who is he?

429
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,978
I'm Sanyasi Naidu.

430
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,648
I'm Madhubala's fiancé.

431
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:01,318
I said I'll come wearing a red jacket,
someone stole my jacket.

432
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:05,072
She would've got angry
waiting for me.

433
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:08,242
Officer, I don't know him.

434
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,078
Catch him.

435
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,163
Sir, I'm not a thief,
I'm Sanyasi Naidu.

436
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,581
If you've doubt,
ask Madhubala.

437
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,918
If he's Sanyasi Naidu,
who is he then?

438
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:22,339
He wanted to marry Madhubala,
why did you tell police to arrest him?

439
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:26,343
I hate competition.
I'll crush them.

440
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,178
Let's catch that fraud, come.

441
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,140
Psycho Seenu got shocked.

442
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,017
How could you tell perfectly
as if you saw it happen?

443
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:37,938
What do you do, Sanyasi Naidu?
- Who? Sanyasi Naidu?

444
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:40,232
He's not Sanyasi Naidu but a fraud.

445
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,442
If you call me a fraud,
I'll break your head.

446
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,444
You look like a cycle mechanic,
are you a doctor?

447
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,281
You're right again.
- She waved her hand first, right?

448
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,037
He made a mistake,
he raised my BP.

449
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:57,916
I'm a doctor, how dare he
calls me a cycle mechanic.

450
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,044
You repair dead bodies, right?

451
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,839
Don't mix retorts in emotion.

452
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,883
Did you see film 'Bharateeyudu'?

453
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:08,385
I've seen it, an old man
like you is the hero.

454
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:09,636
My foot!

455
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,931
If I use my technique,
he would see hell.

456
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,893
If I block his mind,
he would go blank.

457
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,312
Action will start in brain.

458
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:22,065
It's reaction would be more
dangerous than my imagination.

459
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,025
I think he would do it really.

460
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:26,236
We speak so many thing while
having drinks, moreover it's him!

461
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:29,114
Why do you take him seriously?
- You must!

462
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:33,827
You need weapons to kill someone,

463
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:38,332
but all I need is thought
to kill someone.

464
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:41,418
I think he'll die with BP.
- Did you believe him?

465
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,254
If my thoughts are so violent,

466
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:47,674
what would be the situation
of Bala who got kissed by him?

467
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,915
My heart is rocking...

468
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,292
My dream is shattered...

469
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,754
She's a beauty of pleasure...

470
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,975
My heart skipped a beat seeing you...

471
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:42,980
An alarm hit and I went crazy...

472
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:48,068
She's like a cracker
and is jet speed...

473
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:52,739
Sweet dreams are taking
over me slowly...

474
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:57,804
Laid a trap with heart...
saw her falling into it willingly...

475
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:02,726
I won over you with patience...

476
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:05,020
I chased with inspiration...

477
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:14,863
I accepted with love because
you're a king of pleasure...

478
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:20,744
I love to melt in the
warmth of your arms...

479
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,367
Lankavi Island

480
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,956
Bhai, Shakeel too was
killed by Shadow.

481
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:09,960
We thought of bringing out Robert
from jail before you know it.

482
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:11,128
But by then...

483
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,214
He was with us for 20 years.

484
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:17,467
He died like an orphan
in police station.

485
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,887
Let's attend his funeral.
- Very risky, bhai.

486
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,848
Hyderabad ACP Pratap
is targeting us.

487
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:24,558
Arrange it.

488
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:03,180
I must this underworld
in his brief to India.

489
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:06,183
I want all three brothers alive.

490
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:09,176
Stop!

491
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,241
Is it him?

492
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:16,243
Why did he fall under my car?

493
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,760
All of you come out quickly.

494
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,013
Sir has done what he said!

495
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,932
You're really a 'Bharateeyudu' sir!

496
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,560
I've seen only drunkards
challenging,

497
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:45,439
first time I've seen a drunkard
do what he said while drinking.

498
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,193
How did you plan this, sir?

499
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,278
Plan? It happened accidentally...

500
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,280
Did you kill him in an accident?

501
00:51:58,827 --> 00:51:59,786
Get first aid.

502
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:01,538
It's all Seenu's work.

503
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,207
Last night we thought
he was telling for joke,

504
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:04,666
he killed him seriously.

505
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,628
I don't know anything,
he came and fell under my car.

506
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:10,297
Take him to hospital
and call the police.

507
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:13,091
If police come,
they'll take him to hospital,

508
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:14,801
and Seenu will go to jail.

509
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:21,892
You're the first Indian to die
on electric chair in Malaysia.

510
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:27,314
Do you've any last wish, sir?
- Nothing, I beg you.

511
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:28,732
Raise the emotion, little high!

512
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:33,070
Though I harassed you,
we were all like one big family.

513
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:36,907
He fell under my car on his own,
I didn't plan it.

514
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:39,701
If you want get it confirmed
after he regains consciousness.

515
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:42,162
Till then keep it secret
from Pratap.

516
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:43,580
He's police officer, he'll...

517
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:45,999
How can police know
if we don't tell them?

518
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,530
We failed to save brother.

519
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:20,450
We came running like cowards
fearing police.

520
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:32,337
Only three people have the
courage to attack us.

521
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:35,716
John, Kasim and Paul!
I've called them here,

522
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:38,969
I'm sure Shadow would be
one of their men.

523
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:45,642
In this business
each has his own capacity.

524
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,728
Each one has his own territory.

525
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,314
That's our agreement, right?

526
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:57,237
One among you is planning to finish
me, my brothers and my gang.

527
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:58,530
Have you called suspecting us?

528
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:02,159
Shadow belongs to which of
you three men!

529
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:09,226
Lala is in hospital,
they've removed the bullet.

530
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,646
But hasn't yet regained
consciousness.

531
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:14,815
Let's wait till he regains.

532
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,821
I must know the man who attacked us,
who this Shadow is!

533
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,451
He's unconscious for 48 hours now.

534
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:28,078
He hasn't yet opened the eyes.

535
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:30,038
I think he has slipped into coma.
- Is it?

536
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:31,790
Your seat is confirmed.

537
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:36,753
Is it Rajya Sabha seat
to feel happy about?

538
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,673
Electric chair,
he may be in deep sleep.

539
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,802
Your story of revenge has
record dislikes in Facebook.

540
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:47,514
Your story is most popular
after Kolaveri song.

541
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,142
Will you please stop it?

542
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:53,103
I'm tensed here for him,
are you doing comedy here?

543
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,772
Madam is attached to him.

544
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:13,290
How are you, sir?

545
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:16,752
Lakhs of people are waiting
for your reply in Facebook.

546
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:18,545
He didn't hit you
intentionally, did he?

547
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:20,547
Tell me, no need to fear.

548
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:23,217
Law will not only take its
own course but side one too.

549
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,802
Be a guide, don't guide him.

550
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,972
Tell us.
- They say I did it for revenge.

551
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:30,807
Tell truth and
shut their mouths.

552
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,519
Tell them you hurt yourself
and fell under my car.

553
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:35,020
Tell me...tell me I say!

554
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:36,897
Why are you shouting, grandpa?

555
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:38,232
Grandpa?

556
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:40,567
Good name!

557
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,237
Who are you uncle?

558
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:44,488
Uncle?

559
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,991
Don't you know them?

560
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:50,911
I don't know aunty.
- Aunty?

561
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:53,997
Are you mad? Say sorry.
Say sorry.

562
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:59,002
I'm hungry, aunty.

563
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,422
He's going!

564
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:18,939
Not good!

565
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,442
Psycho Seenu's punch isn't ordinary.

566
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:26,572
I thought he would block mind
like Pandu of film 'Pokkiri'.

567
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:29,616
he had made him go mindless.

568
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:30,784
Get lost!

569
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:35,038
I want milk! Milk!
- Go.

570
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,707
Add Horlicks too.
- Come.

571
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:50,387
There's a small block in
brain due to accident.

572
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:51,722
Indeed!

573
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:56,935
His memory has stopped near a point.

574
00:57:57,102 --> 00:58:00,772
His language, behaviour,
habits would be like a small boy.

575
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:03,317
I mean wild child.

576
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:07,112
Isn't there any solution
to this, doctor?

577
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:11,283
When he meets the people
he knows and visits places,

578
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,994
or if he remembers incidents
from his life,

579
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:16,079
there's chance he may
regain his memory.

580
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:20,000
Isn't there any other way, doctor?
- Slim chances.

581
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,670
Sunny, let's go out.

582
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,673
Who is he?
Didn't see his face?

583
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,261
But I saw the cross he was wearing.

584
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:34,681
There's no clear picture of
him in security cameras too.

585
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:38,018
We've alerted city borders
and airports.

586
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:39,937
Where is this Shadow?

587
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,857
Who are you?

588
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,275
Our boy only.

589
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:48,946
Though he's like this, he lost
his memory in an accident,

590
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:50,656
now he's like a small boy.

591
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:53,617
I must study and treat him,

592
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:56,203
give medicines and
give a solution.

593
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,371
What's your name?

594
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:00,457
You made a hero into a small boy,
give him a name too.

595
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:03,877
Chanti!

596
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:07,714
You're a pain in neck,
you've patients too here.

597
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:10,968
Okay, trace out
where this cross was bought!

598
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:17,683
I know this!
I know where this is!

599
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,059
I know!

600
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,812
He behaves like this,
memory loss, right?

601
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:24,064
Actually he did the accident...
- Only I can cure him.

602
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:26,483
You be focused on case
instead of him.

603
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,693
I'll cure him.

604
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,153
But this...
- No problem.

605
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,155
You've your own case and
we've our own case.

606
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:35,576
Inquire about this cross in
souvenir shops and churches.

607
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:37,494
This is that one!

608
00:59:39,997 --> 00:59:41,415
Shall we play a game?

609
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:44,209
This is here, right?
Tell me in which hand it is now?

610
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,128
Chanti, please go inside and play.

611
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:48,589
It's in my hands.
- This one.

612
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,592
No!

613
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:55,762
If it's not in right hand,
it'll be in the left hand.

614
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,765
It will be there! Cheater!

615
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:01,935
You lost! Mustn't play like that.

616
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,188
Stop behaving like kid
and go inside.

617
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,106
Go.
- Chanti, go.

618
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:07,274
Cool down.

619
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:09,818
Come.

620
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:17,701
Sir, you look stylish like
Prabhas in film 'Billa'.

621
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:19,453
Correct.
- What correct?

622
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,246
He's like a stick not Billa.

623
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,207
Don't always say truth, leave it.

624
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,460
I'm little mad.

625
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,629
You do!
- There's a count for it.

626
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,256
Yes, indeed very count.

627
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,802
I'm not here to live silently.

628
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:41,141
You've come to make them
wet their pants.

629
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,979
We don't know who he is!
What do we know to make him remember?

630
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:47,648
Cutting has started!

631
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:51,819
Even if God himself comes,
he can't stop it.

632
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:53,821
Why has he gone mad?

633
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:55,739
All three girls are seeing here.

634
01:00:55,906 --> 01:00:57,491
I think they're getting
attracted by you.

635
01:00:57,658 --> 01:00:59,993
Rarely I use my body.

636
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,746
He was like a hero,
he has become a Chanti.

637
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,417
I'll make him remember his past.

638
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:24,518
She walking towards Chanti,
other two girls are watching him.

639
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:26,520
We can't girls unless
we get rid of Chanti.

640
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,188
She crossed and
moved away from you, sir.

641
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,107
She'll come from behind
and do massage.

642
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:31,775
She's doing for Chanti.

643
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:34,111
Please don't turn to see, sir.
You can't bear it.

644
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:40,909
We met once...no twice!
Do you remember?

645
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,953
No..no...

646
01:01:43,954 --> 01:01:46,957
First time we met in airport.

647
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:55,048
We met there!

648
01:01:57,134 --> 01:02:00,554
You came close to me.
- Did I?

649
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:01,638
Please don't see it,
you can't bear it.

650
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,724
I'll kill him.

651
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,727
You came very close.
- Did I?

652
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:09,563
You came and held me like this.

653
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,565
She's kissing him, sir.

654
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:13,150
Please don't see, turn that side.

655
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:16,445
Shame...shame...aunty!

656
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,906
Spit, I'll complain to grandpa.

657
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,493
Grandpa, aunty did something to me.

658
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:23,327
Kiss.

659
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,162
Beat aunty.

660
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:26,747
Don't you've shame, aunty?

661
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:28,290
I'll beat you.

662
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:31,752
Women are after him,
we must get rid of him.

663
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,756
Mustn't swim again,
severe back ache.

664
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:39,676
Sit here, don't go anywhere.
I'll get you ice cream.

665
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:40,761
Grandpa!

666
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:44,765
I want a big ice cream.
- I'll get you a big one!

667
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,391
Don't go anywhere.
- I'll not.

668
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:49,603
Stay put here.
- Stay here...sit here only.

669
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:07,955
Where's Chanti?
Madhubala was worried about him.

670
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:15,462
If anything happens to him,
women would feel too bad.

671
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:19,341
I left him in traffic because
of excess feelings.

672
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,635
He's not fit to be
a veterinarian too.

673
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:23,887
Will you leave Chanti like that?

674
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:27,724
You're first humans
and then doctors.

675
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:30,811
Will you leave a memory loss
patient and lie to us.

676
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:33,981
If anything happens to him...

677
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:36,233
Come on girls.

678
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:40,320
Grandpa!

679
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:51,582
Grandpa!

680
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:04,428
Grandpa promised to get me
ice cream and hasn't come yet.

681
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:05,679
I'm hungry.

682
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:10,100
He brought it to home, come.

683
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:13,270
You told me to listen
grandpa's words.

684
01:04:13,437 --> 01:04:15,606
Grandpa told me to wait here.

685
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:23,363
Grandpa lied to you.

686
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,948
He left you.

687
01:04:25,908 --> 01:04:26,700
Come.

688
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,624
Madhubala won't find Chanti.
- Yes.

689
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,210
Finding lost person in Malaysia
is very difficult.

690
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:39,129
Moreover he's too...
- He's back!

691
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:41,882
I'll not talk to you.

692
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:45,969
What does that mean?

693
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:49,264
It means I hate you,

694
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:50,098
you're my enemy,

695
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:51,058
I despise you,

696
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:52,142
I'm allergic to you,

697
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:54,812
you're the most worst fellow.

698
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:56,730
Such a small word has
so much meaning.

699
01:04:56,897 --> 01:05:01,318
Will you bear their torture?
Won't you hit back?

700
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:02,986
What should I do?

701
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:05,072
You've seen so many films.

702
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:07,407
How do heroes teach
lessons to villains?

703
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:09,576
You must do like that.

704
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,245
Become a hero!

705
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,999
Teach him a lesson.

706
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,812
Are you Gabbar Singh?

707
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:39,189
Should we get scared of you?

708
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:42,025
You must get scared
at least for this gun, grandpa.

709
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:44,361
For that toy gun?

710
01:05:44,653 --> 01:05:46,446
Chanti, please return the gun.

711
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,158
Why are they acting as
if it's real gun?

712
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:51,952
Don't worry sir,
it's a toy gun. Toy!

713
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:55,622
It's not a toy gun,
it's real gun.

714
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:58,458
It belongs to Pratap sir,
he forgot it, we came for it.

715
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,961
Army of Gabbar Singh!

716
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:04,423
You left me alone last night.

717
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,342
Who got that lousy idea?
Whose plan it was?

718
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,720
I must know it.

719
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:16,810
To know the truth, you must play
medley of songs with Gabbar.

720
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:17,978
Medley of songs?

721
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:20,481
Who will sing the first song?

722
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:23,817
Grandpa!

723
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:25,986
Which letter, Chanti?

724
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:28,906
Not letter, sing with number.

725
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:34,161
I, 2, 3...I'm a crook!

726
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:34,995
I'm king and minister...

727
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:39,249
I'll play day and night...

728
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:42,252
I'm a man of pride...

729
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:55,265
Indeed he's a crook!

730
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:03,524
May be for the gun!

731
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:08,362
Say everything with a song
not with words.

732
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:11,365
Sing a song if not he'll shoot.
Sing!

733
01:07:11,532 --> 01:07:16,286
Come here...
my heart yearns for you...

734
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:21,625
Come here...
it's chaos...

735
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:31,218
I'll crush you...
touch the waist...

736
01:07:34,096 --> 01:07:38,559
You showed dissent on me, right?
You sing now.

737
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:44,398
With flowers in hair and
finger on my cheek, I was going...

738
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:50,154
My street goes mad over me...

739
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:55,576
When I walk wearing jewel
and carrying mango basket...

740
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:01,248
Entire place goes mad..

741
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:04,168
I'm in pain for pleasure...

742
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:06,962
I'm special in giving pleasure...

743
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:09,923
My youth and my beauty
is exotic food...

744
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,927
Come have a feast of it,
you'll go mad...

745
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:18,932
I must take away the gun!

746
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:28,275
Should I give you
special invitation?

747
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:30,736
Should I thrash you?
Sing!

748
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:34,615
Hey girl, what did she say...

749
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:39,786
Hey girl, her words are charming...

750
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:44,290
She said she has
enchanting cheeks...

751
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:47,460
She said the shine on
her cheeks is all mine...

752
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:50,796
Do whatever wherever as you wish...

753
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:53,967
Dashing youth is perfect age...

754
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:56,887
What a great try to take the gun!

755
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:00,474
You're a good actor, darling.

756
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,474
I can do much better, aunty.

757
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:02,559
Here comes the thief!

758
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:05,896
Sing brother Charan's song.

759
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:13,487
Golden goose is here, O girl...

760
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:22,913
With band...

761
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:33,423
Chanti, we're tired,
give us a drink break please.

762
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,553
Why did you join our party?

763
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,180
We got tired watching your dance.

764
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:45,352
Let's add medicine to his drink.

765
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:46,770
If he takes the medicine,
his madness would go worse.

766
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:47,688
Let it happen!

767
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:49,355
Please listen to me.

768
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:52,776
What's this, sir?
- It tastes different.

769
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:55,362
He'll go crazy with this.

770
01:09:57,781 --> 01:09:58,866
It's empty!

771
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:04,955
Grandpa, I've added that
medicine in your drink.

772
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:08,125
Will that medicine affect you?

773
01:10:10,544 --> 01:10:12,546
I too had it little.

774
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:41,742
Few drink down the throat and
breaking into a jig in confusion...

775
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:48,123
Expected something but
something else happened...

776
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:53,921
Crazy party has brought out
the devils from deep inside...

777
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:56,715
Feel like dynamite has
blown in heart...

778
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:59,593
Feel like I'm in sky
flying in a rocket...

779
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,513
Feel like the world
is a photocopy...

780
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:05,015
My double is dancing...

781
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:09,520
Myth...it's all myth...

782
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:48,202
Got information from hospital.

783
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:54,082
ACP Pratap is taking Lala to
India by tomorrow morning flight.

784
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:57,544
Lala mustn't go out of Malaysia.

785
01:13:00,589 --> 01:13:03,008
Why are we in hospital?
Who is the patient?

786
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,219
He's the patient.

787
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,556
There are plenty of toys,
let's go inside and play.

788
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:10,474
Come, Chanti.

789
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:12,893
That's why he's roaming
with doctors.

790
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,645
Lala is finished.

791
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:16,563
I've connected it.

792
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:18,398
He's finished today.

793
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:19,566
What's this, grandpa?

794
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:21,902
Your fever will come down.
- Am I first?

795
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:22,569
You're the first.

796
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:24,822
Make it 5 points,

797
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:27,825
with this shock,
his madness must forever.

798
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:32,287
It's good, grandpa.
- Good?

799
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:34,248
It'll be good, make it 40!

800
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,585
It's much better!
- It will be!

801
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:41,588
Are you doing it properly?
- I'm doing it properly.

802
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,007
70?!

803
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:50,764
Even 70 is ineffective,
it's not ordinary wound.

804
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:54,601
I'm the first to get 100!

805
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:00,983
Nothing is happening to you?

806
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,568
What should happen, grandpa?

807
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:03,527
Get down.

808
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:04,820
Are you the next?
- Yes.

809
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:06,196
Will you wear it now?

810
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:07,489
You're the first.

811
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:09,283
Ready? Can I connect it?

812
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:12,661
If you act smart, I'll cut
marks, do it properly.

813
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:13,620
I have sir.

814
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:17,624
Make it 5!
- 5, uncle!

815
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,209
I have.

816
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,629
No effect.
- Make it 10.- 10?

817
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:25,174
Go to 40!

818
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,301
Do it.
- I've kept 40.

819
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,220
Have you forgotten
to switch it on?

820
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:31,138
That's it!

821
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:36,643
Grandpa is getting electrocuted,
I didn't do anything.

822
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:45,068
You're like a porcupine!

823
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:49,823
Hi hubby!

824
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,658
Today evening I'm leaving
to India.

825
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:55,662
Thank God! No duty for a week
after reaching Hyderabad.

826
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:57,664
You must stay in home with me.

827
01:14:57,915 --> 01:14:59,791
Call doctor to home
by the time I'm there.

828
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,502
I must inquire about your health.

829
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:07,174
What happened?
- Grandpa got electrocuted, uncle.

830
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:08,217
Something has happened to him.

831
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:10,844
I expected this,
you're not ordinary.

832
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:13,347
Who is he?
- Seenu's patient.

833
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:14,932
Little mad!

834
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:17,351
His name is Chanti.
He calls Seenu as grandpa.

835
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:19,520
Chanti, my wife Bindu.

836
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:25,859
Will you come to Hyderabad?
- I'll come along with grandpa.

837
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:08,569
What happened?
- It's a shootout inside, Baba!

838
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:18,328
Mother!

839
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:20,247
Tell me, what's happening?

840
01:16:20,497 --> 01:16:21,415
Mother!

841
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:24,751
Mother!

842
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:55,782
What has happened to my son-in-law?

843
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:09,004
Tell me, what happened to
my son-in-law?

844
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:00,347
Son!

845
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:18,031
Brother!

846
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:22,244
No...no...I'll not survive.

847
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:25,205
My mother and sister are alive.

848
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:26,582
Mother and sister?

849
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:28,208
Pratap is my brother-in-law.

850
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:35,799
Allah is taking me away but
has given you back your family.

851
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:40,554
Be happy, son!

852
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:00,073
Stay here!

853
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:13,670
Get up!

854
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:27,661
It took me 20 years to stab your
heart after stabbing on hand.

855
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,348
Brother!

856
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:51,018
Killed Jeeva!

857
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:53,520
Only you're left now!

858
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:57,774
Who are you?
- Fear!

859
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,779
I'm fear to give you
the taste of fear.

860
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:06,742
I grew up with sole
intention of revenge,

861
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:11,038
I roamed and searched
for you in every country,

862
01:21:11,455 --> 01:21:14,708
I'm the shadow of death
coming towards you,

863
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:15,876
I'm Shadow!

864
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:47,407
When will you present him in court?

865
01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:48,325
Move...

866
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:07,177
If he's here,
who was with our officers then?

867
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:09,429
One of our officer, sir.

868
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:11,348
I didn't want to take the risk.

869
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:16,311
Nana would be mad for
arresting Lala and killing Jeeva.

870
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:20,107
I didn't kill Jeeva and
14 other gangsters, sir.

871
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:22,109
Who is this Shadow?

872
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:25,195
Who is Shadow? How is he?
How would he come?

873
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:28,115
Why is he targeting Nana's gang?
We don't know, sir.

874
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:29,992
I think it's personal.

875
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:34,955
If my guess is right,
Lala is his next target.

876
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:42,546
Nana bhai, your brother has
arrived just now.

877
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:46,049
I told you to finish Pratap
but your brother Jeeva died.

878
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:49,386
Shadow killed my brother.
- I know it.

879
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:53,807
Get details of Shadow,
I'll take care of Lala.

880
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:54,892
Because...

881
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:19,249
Is Bindu doing fine?

882
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:21,752
Can she travel in car?

883
01:23:21,919 --> 01:23:24,963
Why do you get so worried?

884
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:28,258
3rd month only, no problem.
- No, mother-in-law...

885
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:29,968
What's this like a little boy?

886
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:33,180
You can involve in shoot outs
and I can't even go to a temple.

887
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:36,099
You're pregnant not me.
Come.

888
01:23:40,938 --> 01:23:42,189
Are you doing fine, madam?

889
01:23:42,397 --> 01:23:45,526
Today my son's birthday.
Offer special prayers.- Okay.

890
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:53,534
Rajaram, Paidipala race!

891
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:57,538
I know, I've been offering prayers
for the past 20 years.

892
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,681
Walk carefully!

893
01:24:35,993 --> 01:24:38,912
You love pudding as much
as you love sister.

894
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:44,084
You know your mother and sister
are alive after years,

895
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:47,921
why are you crying
instead of meeting them?

896
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:57,764
Nobody must know about
my family till Nana is dead.

897
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,600
It's dangerous to them.

898
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:04,438
Instead of staying with them,
it's better to remain a shadow.

899
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:05,939
Only then I can protect them.

900
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:09,443
Brother-in-law has become
enemy by arresting Lala.

901
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:14,490
Why is Pratap after Nana's gang?
- I must know it.

902
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:16,867
Psycho Seenu lives in the opposite
house of your brother-in-law’s home.

903
01:25:33,634 --> 01:25:34,301
Illusion!

904
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:38,889
Psycho grandpa, I'm here!

905
01:25:42,893 --> 01:25:44,978
Why are you shutting the door, grandpa?

906
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:47,314
Stop!

907
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:48,774
Grandpa...

908
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:50,818
Stop it I say!

909
01:25:51,318 --> 01:25:59,701
I made a mistake, so I tolerated
when you called me as grandpa.

910
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:02,830
I saw your real self that day!

911
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,586
Grandpa, that is...
- No more drama!

912
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:16,593
What man? Why are you still
shouting after seeing it?

913
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,178
You short man!

914
01:26:18,345 --> 01:26:19,930
I'll rap your head!

915
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:22,933
I haven't yet recovered from
the shock you gave that day.

916
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,937
Why did you enter my life
again, Stranger?

917
01:26:27,187 --> 01:26:30,190
I lost 15 days of my life
because of you.

918
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:33,360
Keep shut till my pending
work is completed.

919
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:35,195
I'll leave silently
after it's done.

920
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,947
If I don't accept.

921
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:38,782
I'll turn violent.

922
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:41,034
If you remain calm,
I'll eat chocolate like Chanti.

923
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:42,619
If not you'll get hit by bullets.

924
01:26:42,786 --> 01:26:45,330
Which is better?
- Chocolates are better.

925
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:48,375
It's sweet. You'll use me
only for 15 days, right?

926
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:50,878
No extensions, right?
- It depends on your behaviour.

927
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:54,465
My foot behaviour,
we can use it as we wish.

928
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:56,300
Aren't you changing at will?
- Come.

929
01:26:56,967 --> 01:26:58,302
Where are you taking me?

930
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:01,263
When did you come?

931
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,806
You saw Chanti, right?

932
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:08,145
My wife Bindu, you talked to
her on computer, right?

933
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:10,314
Remember her?
- Mother is also there.

934
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:14,151
Why did you bring Chanti here?

935
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:17,404
I started the treatment, right?
He's here to complete the course.

936
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:20,407
Looks like you'll get finished.

937
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:24,077
Chanti, come to my home.
- You'll come, won't you?

938
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:26,830
I'll come after playing
with grandpa.

939
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:40,427
When did you come? How are you?
- I'm fine.

940
01:27:40,594 --> 01:27:42,054
Do you know how worried
I was about you?

941
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:43,597
She has fallen for him.

942
01:27:46,809 --> 01:27:47,601
Are you fine?

943
01:27:49,186 --> 01:27:49,895
You want?

944
01:27:50,062 --> 01:27:51,647
Enjoy girl and lollipop.

945
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,441
Home Minister's House

946
01:27:57,319 --> 01:27:59,863
Why have you grown thin, son?
- I didn't find the girl, mummy.

947
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,156
He didn't find the girl.

948
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:03,033
PA, it seems he didn't find the girl.

949
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,535
My sister has returned 4 days ago,

950
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:06,870
she missed him getting
confused about him.

951
01:28:07,037 --> 01:28:09,706
She will, unless she becomes his wife,
she won't come to our way.

952
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:10,916
Arrange to see her.

953
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,252
No more seeing her,
it's engagement directly.

954
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:14,086
Engagement!

955
01:28:14,253 --> 01:28:15,379
Directly engagement!

956
01:28:15,546 --> 01:28:17,089
This Friday!
- This Friday!

957
01:28:17,256 --> 01:28:19,216
Sir, I'll tell my sister and...

958
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:22,469
Did you inform me and came on
pillion of your sister's scooter?

959
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:24,638
You make the arrangements.
- Okay.

960
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:26,014
Today is Rakhi

961
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,392
A celebration of affection between
brothers and sisters.

962
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:31,728
If brother ties a Rakhi
from his sister,

963
01:28:31,895 --> 01:28:37,025
this signifies that he would stand
by her through thick and thin.

964
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:40,904
This festival is sister's
prayer for brother's safety.

965
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:01,675
How long will you be sad for him?

966
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:05,179
Chanti, come in.

967
01:29:06,763 --> 01:29:08,849
Mother-in-law, he's Chanti.

968
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:11,101
I know, I saw him that day!

969
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:13,020
Bindu's mother.

970
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:15,856
Then, she's my mother too!

971
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:29,077
Why is Bindu dull?
- She remembered her brother.

972
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:30,037
She's feeling sad.

973
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:32,372
I've something for Bindu,

974
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:34,875
if she closes her eyes,
I'll give it.

975
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:38,045
Don't play with me, please.
- Come, if not he'll feel bad.

976
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,964
Come on, do as he says.

977
01:29:41,465 --> 01:29:43,550
Come, Bindu! Come.

978
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:45,969
Close your eyes.

979
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:47,888
Close your eyes, Bindu.

980
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:55,896
Open your eyes now.

981
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:00,776
Tie this Rakhi.

982
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:06,406
Bindu's brother went missing
as a boy.

983
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:08,826
Since then she stopped
celebrating Rakhi.

984
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:11,245
I'll not keep quiet,
she must tie it.

985
01:30:11,411 --> 01:30:16,083
If you tie, I'll give chocolate,
if not I'll beat grandpa.

986
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:20,170
Okay, I'll tie.
- Tie.

987
01:30:37,187 --> 01:30:39,606
From today I'm your elder brother
and you're my sister.

988
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:40,607
Brother!

989
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:43,861
Here's your chocolate.

990
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:49,158
Though Seenu was a pain in neck,
you got a brother because of him.

991
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:51,076
Come, we're getting late
for doctor's appointment.

992
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:53,370
Bye mother-in-law! Bye Chanti!
- Bye brother.

993
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:56,707
I'll make pudding for you.

994
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:22,316
I know why brother-in-law
is after Nana.

995
01:31:23,484 --> 01:31:25,861
They're planning bomb blasts
in October in Hyderabad.

996
01:31:26,737 --> 01:31:28,572
Lala is lodged in secret jail.

997
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:32,868
Okay!

998
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:42,920
What are you seeing in it?

999
01:31:47,591 --> 01:31:48,926
Watching photos.

1000
01:31:49,092 --> 01:31:52,095
Don't lie to me.
Who are you? Why are you here?

1001
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:56,850
Why are you talking like that?

1002
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:57,684
Stop it!

1003
01:31:58,519 --> 01:32:01,104
Tell me the truth,
I saw you browsing laptop.

1004
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:03,023
Who sent you here?

1005
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:09,863
Just now my daughter tied rakhi
and called you as brother.

1006
01:32:10,447 --> 01:32:11,698
You called me mother.

1007
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:15,118
You're acting innocent with
some ulterior motive.

1008
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:18,455
Are you cheating us?
- No, mother.

1009
01:32:19,414 --> 01:32:22,417
Tell me, why did you enter this home?
Are you patient or criminal?

1010
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:23,126
Tell me!

1011
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:24,628
Mother, please stop!

1012
01:32:24,795 --> 01:32:26,296
Why did you come here?

1013
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:27,631
How long will you be silent?

1014
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:29,758
You yearned for mother
for 20 years,

1015
01:32:29,925 --> 01:32:31,718
will you be a criminal for her?

1016
01:32:34,471 --> 01:32:35,931
What are you saying?

1017
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:43,397
You're my Raja...

1018
01:32:46,692 --> 01:32:48,402
Why didn't you tell me?

1019
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:52,322
Mother!

1020
01:32:53,824 --> 01:32:55,742
I thought you and sister
were dead, mother.

1021
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:05,335
I grew up with revenge
not with love, mother.

1022
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,676
I grew up with the sole aim
of wiping Nana's gang.

1023
01:33:12,926 --> 01:33:17,514
I and your sister jumped
from the boat.

1024
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:23,979
We didn't find you.

1025
01:33:25,022 --> 01:33:32,362
We came to Hyderabad to kill
my brother who betrayed your father.

1026
01:33:32,696 --> 01:33:35,782
But your uncle too was dead.

1027
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:37,701
Somebody killed him too.

1028
01:33:38,535 --> 01:33:42,122
Aunty accused us as the
reason for his killing.

1029
01:33:42,873 --> 01:33:46,502
I came to know then, there's
someone else behind all this.

1030
01:33:46,919 --> 01:33:49,004
Your aunt knows it but
she refused to tell.

1031
01:33:49,797 --> 01:33:53,091
Aunt thinks we're responsible
for his death.

1032
01:33:53,258 --> 01:33:56,804
Since then she has stopped
talking to us.

1033
01:33:58,388 --> 01:33:59,640
Where's aunt now, mother?

1034
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:08,398
Aunt!

1035
01:34:13,987 --> 01:34:15,405
He's Raja, sister-in-law.

1036
01:34:17,616 --> 01:34:19,409
I met him after 20 years.

1037
01:34:20,077 --> 01:34:22,830
At least now talk to us.

1038
01:34:24,623 --> 01:34:28,752
Our family scattered for 20 years.

1039
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:32,005
We were left as orphans
by losing father and uncle.

1040
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:35,926
But people responsible for
this are living happily.

1041
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,762
Tell me aunt, who are they?

1042
01:34:39,096 --> 01:34:41,515
You hid it for 20 years,
tell me at least now.

1043
01:34:42,099 --> 01:34:46,186
I'll tell you, Raja.
I was scared to tell till now.

1044
01:34:46,895 --> 01:34:49,189
I've got courage to tell
after seeing you.

1045
01:34:50,065 --> 01:34:51,024
I'll tell.

1046
01:34:51,692 --> 01:34:55,028
Details of Nana's gang which your
father collected with great risk,

1047
01:34:55,195 --> 01:34:57,114
seeing it wasn't published
in newspaper,

1048
01:34:57,281 --> 01:34:59,032
your uncle was aghast,

1049
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:01,952
he went to the press to
ask Chaitanya Prasad,

1050
01:35:02,578 --> 01:35:05,455
he came to know that he has
sold the file to Nana bhai,

1051
01:35:05,789 --> 01:35:10,878
not only that ACP Tyagi too
is involved in it,

1052
01:35:11,503 --> 01:35:13,797
while he was telling me
this on phone,

1053
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:17,217
those criminals killed him brutally.

1054
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:24,224
I'll punish them for their sins.

1055
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:28,395
Chaitanya Prasad, Tyagi and Nana
nobody will remain alive.

1056
01:35:31,023 --> 01:35:35,736
Down with police brutality!

1057
01:36:05,182 --> 01:36:11,021
Maharashtra police arrested Acharyaji for
protesting peacefully against corruption...

1058
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:14,942
Why did you call me urgently?

1059
01:36:15,484 --> 01:36:18,570
Did you see Acharyaji's
popularity has reached peak?

1060
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:20,531
He's being called
as Mahatma in India.

1061
01:36:20,697 --> 01:36:23,283
Ending corruption is Acharya's aim!

1062
01:36:23,784 --> 01:36:25,744
This is the right time
to finish him.

1063
01:36:26,703 --> 01:36:29,414
I gave you Rs.100 crores
to plant bombs.

1064
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:32,167
We're getting pressure from top.

1065
01:36:33,127 --> 01:36:35,629
But no hope that you can do it.

1066
01:36:36,046 --> 01:36:36,964
What are you saying?

1067
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:40,050
Some Shadow has killed your
brother Jeeva and your men,

1068
01:36:40,217 --> 01:36:42,177
Pratap arrested your
younger brother Lala,

1069
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:43,554
he's now in Hyderabad jail,
what if he spills the beans?

1070
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:47,307
Our plan to bomb Hyderabad
will be finished.

1071
01:36:47,474 --> 01:36:50,394
Nana, the blasts must happen.

1072
01:36:50,561 --> 01:36:53,564
Think about payment
once you engage Nana,

1073
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:54,565
not about the job!

1074
01:36:54,731 --> 01:36:59,153
Let anyone dare stop me,
blasts will rock Acharya's meeting.

1075
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:01,655
When?
- On the appointed day!

1076
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:04,992
Tell me!

1077
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:10,664
Who is funding you?

1078
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:12,166
What's your plan?

1079
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:13,917
Turn approver and tell the truth,

1080
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:17,045
at least you'll remain alive
in your family.

1081
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:19,339
You too have a family, right?

1082
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,342
It seems your wife is pregnant.

1083
01:37:22,593 --> 01:37:24,595
Mother and child would die together.

1084
01:37:36,523 --> 01:37:39,443
1Tell me where have you
planned the blasts?

1085
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:40,444
Tell me.

1086
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:46,158
October is nearing,

1087
01:37:46,325 --> 01:37:49,870
he's the only source to know where
and who their target is?

1088
01:37:50,037 --> 01:37:53,457
You risked like to arrest him,
will you kill him now?

1089
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,043
He was blabbering nonsense, sir.

1090
01:37:59,129 --> 01:38:00,881
How is my brother?

1091
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:05,219
He may die.

1092
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:08,263
I think Pratap may kill him
in a day or two.

1093
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:11,642
What are you doing?
- He won't listen to anyone.

1094
01:38:12,309 --> 01:38:15,562
DG has given him full powers.
What can I do?

1095
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:17,815
Kill Pratap.

1096
01:38:18,941 --> 01:38:21,235
Have you forgotten that
I'm Police Commissioner?

1097
01:38:21,401 --> 01:38:24,655
I'll give Rs.10 crores.
- I can take the risk now.

1098
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:27,491
Tomorrow is Ganesh immersion day,

1099
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:32,412
Ganesh idols are immersed in water,
Pratap will die!

1100
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:13,328
Home Minister will be here
in 30 minutes, sir.

1101
01:40:10,219 --> 01:40:11,053
Who is it?

1102
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,724
You don't have the right
to live on earth, Tyagi!

1103
01:40:15,891 --> 01:40:17,267
Do you know with whom
you're talking to?

1104
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:22,189
I know a sinner who sells
people's lives for money.

1105
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:27,277
It's not holy band,
it's your funeral band.

1106
01:40:27,444 --> 01:40:28,779
Who are you?

1107
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,180
Who are you?

1108
01:41:36,513 --> 01:41:38,098
Shadow of your death!

1109
01:41:44,313 --> 01:41:44,855
Shadow?

1110
01:41:46,023 --> 01:41:46,940
Shadow?

1111
01:41:54,781 --> 01:42:00,454
Death is the punishment for sins
committed by you and Chaitanya Prasad.

1112
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:19,723
Is he a lightning...

1113
01:42:22,184 --> 01:42:25,896
Is he God in human form...

1114
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:37,991
Is he here to do justice...

1115
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:44,081
Is he Lord Shiva to wage war...

1116
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:52,756
Hail Lord Ganesha!

1117
01:43:35,132 --> 01:43:36,717
Somebody has killed Commissioner.

1118
01:43:37,926 --> 01:43:43,390
Unknown assailants have killed
Commissioner in Ganesh immersion.

1119
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:47,394
Move, I must see him.

1120
01:43:47,644 --> 01:43:49,146
What happened?
- Killed him.

1121
01:43:49,313 --> 01:43:51,440
Who?
- He killed him.

1122
01:43:51,607 --> 01:43:54,151
He spilled colours and killed him.

1123
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:59,031
Did you see the killer?
- We both saw him.

1124
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:00,407
Did you see him?
What did you see?

1125
01:44:00,574 --> 01:44:03,243
I saw half and he saw half.

1126
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:05,078
Tell me.- He had a half bottle
and I had a half bottle,

1127
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:07,498
no kick, but we saw him fully.

1128
01:44:07,664 --> 01:44:09,416
What's your problem?
How did the killer look like?

1129
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:11,460
He's tall like you.

1130
01:44:11,627 --> 01:44:15,297
He has big eyes,
he kept knife in mouth,

1131
01:44:15,464 --> 01:44:16,965
he smeared colour not to
recognise his face,

1132
01:44:17,132 --> 01:44:18,091
then, he killed him.

1133
01:44:18,258 --> 01:44:21,053
He killed him, but before that
they had a discussion.

1134
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,763
They talked to each other?
What did they talk about?

1135
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:23,597
Name...

1136
01:44:24,515 --> 01:44:25,766
No, shadow.

1137
01:44:25,933 --> 01:44:27,684
Shadow!
- No, shadow.

1138
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:29,812
Shadow? Here too?

1139
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:32,439
I don't get this, Nana.

1140
01:44:32,606 --> 01:44:35,025
I thought Shadow was targeting
only you and your gang.

1141
01:44:35,192 --> 01:44:37,444
He has killed Commissioner Tyagi too.

1142
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:39,780
Who this Shadow is?
- I too don't know.

1143
01:44:39,947 --> 01:44:42,783
What's the necessity to kill Tyagi?

1144
01:44:47,079 --> 01:44:50,541
You, Tyagi and I joined for a cause.

1145
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,460
Journalist Raghuram.

1146
01:44:55,295 --> 01:44:56,380
Do you remember?

1147
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,465
That Raghuram.

1148
01:45:00,467 --> 01:45:03,637
Name of the undercover operation
was Operation Shadow.

1149
01:45:03,804 --> 01:45:05,305
Yes, operation Shadow.

1150
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:07,724
The boy who escaped then,

1151
01:45:09,893 --> 01:45:13,480
he's Shadow now!
I'll plan to catch him.

1152
01:45:16,233 --> 01:45:18,360
What? Why are you so excited?

1153
01:45:18,527 --> 01:45:23,824
The killer who killed Commissioner
is none other but Chanti.

1154
01:45:23,991 --> 01:45:24,658
I saw it.

1155
01:45:31,498 --> 01:45:32,666
Come, Raja.

1156
01:45:38,464 --> 01:45:39,756
Raja?

1157
01:45:40,257 --> 01:45:41,341
Raja is my son.

1158
01:45:42,342 --> 01:45:46,513
I don't get what you're saying.
- I'll tell you.

1159
01:45:56,273 --> 01:45:58,609
Is there so much pain
in your life?

1160
01:46:00,444 --> 01:46:02,112
You've done a good thing
by killing him.

1161
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:03,864
Till my job is complete,

1162
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:05,908
my sister mustn't know that
I'm her brother.

1163
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:10,204
But Chanti, I mean Raja,

1164
01:46:10,871 --> 01:46:15,209
Psycho Seenu too saw killing
Commissioner along with me.

1165
01:46:17,419 --> 01:46:18,170
Did he see?

1166
01:46:18,337 --> 01:46:22,090
What's this? He says Chanti but
killed a man with bare hands.

1167
01:46:22,966 --> 01:46:25,427
If you know anything
about the killer,

1168
01:46:25,594 --> 01:46:27,387
if you suspect anyone's
involvement,

1169
01:46:27,554 --> 01:46:29,932
come immediately to my home
and inform me.

1170
01:46:30,098 --> 01:46:33,602
Govt. will reward Rs.50 lakhs for
helping to catch the killer.

1171
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:34,561
Got him!

1172
01:46:34,728 --> 01:46:37,439
Respected Home Minister
Nalla Neelakantam Naidu,

1173
01:46:37,606 --> 01:46:38,982
I'm telling you truth,

1174
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:42,778
I know who killed Commissioner,

1175
01:46:42,945 --> 01:46:45,614
infact he's staying with me
in my house,

1176
01:46:45,989 --> 01:46:49,034
but trust me, I don't have any
connection with him, sir.

1177
01:46:50,244 --> 01:46:52,079
send as many battalions
as possible,

1178
01:46:52,246 --> 01:46:53,956
if necessary,
get help from other states,

1179
01:46:54,123 --> 01:46:57,417
arrest him but give
Rs.50 lakh reward to me.

1180
01:46:57,584 --> 01:47:00,587
Please don't tell him
I gave this information, sir.

1181
01:47:06,093 --> 01:47:07,177
What's it?

1182
01:47:07,344 --> 01:47:10,472
Did you watch TV?
- I buy TV's but never watch it.

1183
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:11,181
What happened?

1184
01:47:11,348 --> 01:47:13,433
Live discussion about
Commissioner's murder.

1185
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,020
His time came and he left.
Can he come back?

1186
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:19,273
He won't.

1187
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:21,275
Do you know Home Minister's address?

1188
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:22,109
Address?

1189
01:47:22,276 --> 01:47:25,112
I don't know Home Minister also.
Why do you want his address?

1190
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:27,614
I killed the Commissioner.

1191
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:29,825
My job is done.

1192
01:47:30,325 --> 01:47:31,994
I want to surrender now.

1193
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:36,373
They've announced Rs.50 lakhs
for catching the killer.

1194
01:47:37,499 --> 01:47:42,129
If you take me to them,
you'll get Rs.50 lakhs.

1195
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:53,474
Till now I tortured you
emotionally and physically,

1196
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,975
and hurt you financially too!

1197
01:47:55,684 --> 01:47:58,312
Moreover you took care of
my boarding and lodging.

1198
01:47:59,146 --> 01:48:03,066
That's why I want you to get
the reward as my gratitude.

1199
01:48:04,693 --> 01:48:08,572
Are you so sentimental too?
You've taken my heart!

1200
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:11,408
How much love you've for me, Chanti?

1201
01:48:12,284 --> 01:48:16,330
You thought about my reward
but they'll hang you, son!

1202
01:48:16,497 --> 01:48:19,333
Let them do it, useless life,
bore to live for long.

1203
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:23,170
I'll fulfill your wish
to go to gallows.

1204
01:48:23,337 --> 01:48:26,673
Eat spicy biryani tonight
and sleep in AC room.

1205
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,925
Gallows is guaranteed.

1206
01:48:28,717 --> 01:48:31,345
What's the reason to
kill Commissioner?

1207
01:48:31,762 --> 01:48:33,847
Do you want reward or reason?

1208
01:48:34,014 --> 01:48:36,892
Keep reason with you,
get me the reward.

1209
01:48:40,771 --> 01:48:46,985
My engagement is fixed with
Home Minister's son Sanyasi Naidu.

1210
01:48:47,152 --> 01:48:49,112
So what?
- They'll forcibly marry me off.

1211
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:50,489
Marry him.

1212
01:48:51,532 --> 01:48:53,116
Don't you've any problem
if I'm married?

1213
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:55,702
What's my problem
if you get married?

1214
01:48:58,747 --> 01:49:00,874
So, I imagined everything myself.

1215
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:04,711
Okay, I'll marry him.

1216
01:49:07,422 --> 01:49:08,715
Will you marry?

1217
01:49:09,883 --> 01:49:11,552
Me!

1218
01:49:36,535 --> 01:49:38,829
The girl is fantastic...

1219
01:49:39,246 --> 01:49:41,498
She's devastating...

1220
01:49:41,874 --> 01:49:44,418
She comes into my dreams
in day time...

1221
01:49:44,585 --> 01:49:47,171
She's teasing my youth...

1222
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:49,673
There's scissors in her eyes...

1223
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,758
It's cutting my heart...

1224
01:49:51,925 --> 01:49:54,595
My lover..

1225
01:49:56,597 --> 01:49:59,016
Hit a six of my beauty...

1226
01:49:59,183 --> 01:50:02,352
Where has your eye pierced into me?

1227
01:50:02,519 --> 01:50:07,191
No need to wait anymore...

1228
01:50:07,357 --> 01:50:09,568
Take on me, my hero...

1229
01:50:09,735 --> 01:50:13,614
My waist is invisible
like black beads...

1230
01:50:45,229 --> 01:50:47,356
I'll take you away with me...

1231
01:50:47,523 --> 01:50:50,359
I got you in my grip...

1232
01:50:50,526 --> 01:50:52,736
I'll steal your youth,
I'll shatter your shy...

1233
01:50:52,903 --> 01:50:55,447
I'll make your nights sleepless...

1234
01:50:55,614 --> 01:50:58,492
You don't appear but
very mischievous...

1235
01:51:00,327 --> 01:51:00,744
My dear...

1236
01:51:00,911 --> 01:51:03,497
You're sharpener
to tone youth...

1237
01:51:03,664 --> 01:51:06,416
My dear...

1238
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,418
I'm smooth and shiny...

1239
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:11,171
Come on, take me...

1240
01:51:11,338 --> 01:51:17,010
Burn heat of passion
with fire of desire...

1241
01:51:17,177 --> 01:51:19,012
Take me all over...

1242
01:51:19,179 --> 01:51:21,598
The girl's beauty is
enchanting music...

1243
01:51:21,765 --> 01:51:24,351
Her sensational body
is alluring wine...

1244
01:51:24,518 --> 01:51:28,272
Youthfulness is spicy
side dish for it...

1245
01:52:10,606 --> 01:52:12,733
My dear doll,
I'll aim the arrow at you...

1246
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,569
I'll count the beauty
spots in you...

1247
01:52:15,736 --> 01:52:17,988
I'll crush you,
I'll take on you...

1248
01:52:18,155 --> 01:52:20,782
I'll make you sweat
with passion...

1249
01:52:20,949 --> 01:52:23,744
You're too proud...

1250
01:52:26,246 --> 01:52:29,416
You're a trouble that
never leaves me...

1251
01:52:30,584 --> 01:52:33,837
My dear, somehow like this or that...

1252
01:52:34,004 --> 01:52:39,176
Every minute is dark for me...
raging desire is lighting it...

1253
01:52:39,343 --> 01:52:42,471
Open the treasure of beauty...

1254
01:52:42,638 --> 01:52:44,765
Steal it...

1255
01:52:44,932 --> 01:52:47,017
In pursuit of fun and happiness...

1256
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:49,686
Throw away shyness into dustbin...

1257
01:52:49,853 --> 01:52:52,940
Have a blast...

1258
01:53:16,672 --> 01:53:18,715
CP runs 22 TV channels in 22 states
along with Jagruti channel,

1259
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:21,051
he has grown to become a media king,

1260
01:53:21,218 --> 01:53:22,970
he has grown powerful
to order governments.

1261
01:53:23,137 --> 01:53:25,013
presently he's a
resident of Singapore,

1262
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:27,307
an international seminar
on media is scheduled here,

1263
01:53:27,474 --> 01:53:28,267
he's coming to attend it,

1264
01:53:28,433 --> 01:53:32,062
but Home Minister is the Chief guest,
so security will be tight.

1265
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:35,357
your brother-in-law Pratap is
the security in charge.

1266
01:53:37,317 --> 01:53:39,820
Home Minister's Guest House

1267
01:53:41,697 --> 01:53:46,577
My mind gets heated with
murders and tension.

1268
01:53:46,743 --> 01:53:49,329
I'll get massaged for an hour.

1269
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:51,748
Greetings sir.

1270
01:53:51,915 --> 01:53:53,417
Who are you?
Where's Massage Manikam?

1271
01:53:53,584 --> 01:53:54,585
He's my brother-in-law.

1272
01:53:54,751 --> 01:53:56,753
He has gone to Bangkok
for holidays.

1273
01:53:57,087 --> 01:54:00,048
He has told me everything
about you, sir.

1274
01:54:00,215 --> 01:54:02,718
I must forget myself for
an hour, show your skill.

1275
01:54:02,885 --> 01:54:04,011
You come, sir.

1276
01:54:05,721 --> 01:54:08,098
Why do you worry sir?
I'll remove it.

1277
01:54:10,267 --> 01:54:13,061
Scent of fragrance
instead of blood.

1278
01:54:20,486 --> 01:54:23,780
My son is marrying a middle class
girl without taking any dowry.

1279
01:54:23,947 --> 01:54:24,740
Today is the engagement.

1280
01:54:24,907 --> 01:54:26,950
Somebody gave this DVD
as gift for you.

1281
01:54:27,117 --> 01:54:27,910
They've asked you to
watch it immediately.

1282
01:54:28,076 --> 01:54:29,203
No time to watch films, son.

1283
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:32,456
It's not a film,
it is your political future.

1284
01:54:32,623 --> 01:54:33,957
What's this nonsense?

1285
01:54:34,124 --> 01:54:38,295
My political future?
What's in it?

1286
01:54:40,464 --> 01:54:42,132
Who is he?
He looks just like me.

1287
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:44,218
That's me!

1288
01:54:45,928 --> 01:54:47,471
Go out...out...

1289
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,110
CP channel's secret operation.

1290
01:55:02,778 --> 01:55:04,488
Neelakantam's blue film!

1291
01:55:04,988 --> 01:55:07,115
Sex in the name of massage.

1292
01:55:07,282 --> 01:55:08,784
Enjoying sex with young girls!

1293
01:55:08,951 --> 01:55:10,160
They've played with me.

1294
01:55:10,327 --> 01:55:13,163
I lost myself in massage,
did you do all this?

1295
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:15,124
What did I do?

1296
01:55:18,335 --> 01:55:20,295
How is Avatar, Neelu?

1297
01:55:20,587 --> 01:55:22,256
Shut up! Who are you?

1298
01:55:22,422 --> 01:55:25,092
CP channel owner Chaitanya Prasad.

1299
01:55:25,884 --> 01:55:28,512
What's this CP?
What sort of DVD is that?

1300
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:31,181
You placed cameras in different
angles and showed that I'm doing it.

1301
01:55:31,348 --> 01:55:33,267
I know you didn't do anything.

1302
01:55:33,433 --> 01:55:35,185
But public won't believe it.

1303
01:55:35,352 --> 01:55:37,354
You did so much in intoxication.

1304
01:55:37,521 --> 01:55:39,064
This is just a trailer.

1305
01:55:39,231 --> 01:55:41,608
I've full film,
shall I release it?

1306
01:55:41,775 --> 01:55:44,695
No...no...
Elections are nearing!

1307
01:55:44,862 --> 01:55:45,737
Pay Rs.25 crores.

1308
01:55:45,904 --> 01:55:47,823
I'm not taking any dowry
for my son also.

1309
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:50,868
I'll pay, how can I refuse?
Cut it.

1310
01:55:51,618 --> 01:55:52,369
Come.

1311
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:53,954
Greetings madam.
- Greetings.

1312
01:55:54,121 --> 01:55:55,456
My sister.

1313
01:55:55,706 --> 01:55:58,167
She's very beautiful
like Goddess Lakshmi!

1314
01:55:58,333 --> 01:56:00,210
That's why I fell for her, mummy.

1315
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:04,882
My sister.
- Greetings uncle.

1316
01:56:05,048 --> 01:56:08,385
My sister-in-law is very lucky to
become Minister's daughter-in-law.

1317
01:56:08,552 --> 01:56:11,054
Uncle, your home is also
quite big like you.

1318
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:12,806
Do you've home theatre?
I want to watch Avatar.

1319
01:56:12,973 --> 01:56:16,351
I do have but nothing is
visible, virus problem.

1320
01:56:16,518 --> 01:56:19,813
He's my sister's friend,
guide and philosopher.

1321
01:56:23,984 --> 01:56:27,404
He wants to talk to you,
if you spare little time.

1322
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:28,655
He'll talk to you alone.

1323
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:31,742
What's his problem, doctor?

1324
01:56:45,005 --> 01:56:48,175
Why is my daughter-in-law making
gestures to him and vice versa?

1325
01:56:48,342 --> 01:56:49,927
Something fishy.

1326
01:56:51,136 --> 01:56:54,014
You've announced Rs.50 lakhs reward
for Commissioner's killer, right?

1327
01:56:54,181 --> 01:56:55,390
Give it to me.

1328
01:56:55,724 --> 01:56:57,100
Did you kill him?

1329
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,520
I killed him.

1330
01:57:00,437 --> 01:57:02,397
Give the reward to Psycho Seenu.

1331
01:57:03,649 --> 01:57:05,192
Cash would be better.

1332
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:07,903
He looks like a software engineer,
how could he kill him?

1333
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:09,530
He won't tell the reason.

1334
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:12,908
I killed him to save
your family honour, sir.

1335
01:57:13,575 --> 01:57:16,912
What's the link between
my family honour and him?

1336
01:57:17,121 --> 01:57:18,372
What's this?
- Watch this!

1337
01:57:18,539 --> 01:57:19,790
You'll understand all the links.

1338
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:23,460
I'm not saying because
she's my sister-in-law.

1339
01:57:23,627 --> 01:57:26,213
Our Madhubala is fire!

1340
01:57:26,421 --> 01:57:27,589
It's burning here!

1341
01:57:27,881 --> 01:57:29,883
My aunt doesn't have
any boy friends.

1342
01:57:34,054 --> 01:57:36,223
Few days ago I called
this girl to come and love.

1343
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:37,891
She said this is love.

1344
01:57:38,058 --> 01:57:39,643
Meanwhile your son said
come, let's marry!

1345
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:42,062
And you both decided
let's stay together.

1346
01:57:42,229 --> 01:57:45,190
No, there's no resort
we've not visited,

1347
01:57:45,357 --> 01:57:46,567
there's no room we didn't stay.

1348
01:57:49,111 --> 01:57:52,406
Tyagi was blackmailing your future
daughter-in-law with this video.

1349
01:57:52,573 --> 01:57:54,533
I didn't want her to miss
a VIP family like yours,

1350
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,411
so I sacrificed my love,
and killed him!

1351
01:57:59,246 --> 01:58:01,999
You played game and
call it as sacrifice.

1352
01:58:02,166 --> 01:58:03,667
Though Tyagi is dead,

1353
01:58:03,834 --> 01:58:06,295
Chaitanya Prasad who gave
technical support is still alive.

1354
01:58:06,462 --> 01:58:07,921
It seems he lives in Singapore.

1355
01:58:08,172 --> 01:58:09,923
Got him at right time.

1356
01:58:10,174 --> 01:58:12,092
I must get him to down the ACP.

1357
01:58:12,259 --> 01:58:17,014
Kill him also,
my trouble would be over.

1358
01:58:17,347 --> 01:58:19,433
Are you planning murder
as Home Minister?

1359
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:21,435
Criminal must get punished.

1360
01:58:21,602 --> 01:58:23,353
I'm like Chiranjeevi in
the film 'Tagore'.

1361
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,273
Never spare men who intrude
your privacy with cameras.

1362
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:27,149
Kill him too.

1363
01:58:27,316 --> 01:58:30,194
Correct sir, punishment for
killing one or two is same.

1364
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:33,197
But rewards are two!
Pay Rs.1 crore to Seenu.

1365
01:58:33,363 --> 01:58:37,284
Rs.50 lakhs and now Rs.1 crore,
I'll give you Rs.1.5 crores.

1366
01:58:37,951 --> 01:58:38,535
Kill him!

1367
01:58:38,702 --> 01:58:42,206
Day after tomorrow he's coming
to Hyderabad to open a channel.

1368
01:58:42,372 --> 01:58:43,707
I'm the chief guest.

1369
01:58:43,874 --> 01:58:46,794
If you're the chief guest,
security will be tight.

1370
01:58:47,211 --> 01:58:48,629
Leave it to me, I'll take care of it.

1371
01:58:48,796 --> 01:58:51,048
I'll show the way,
you hit the target.

1372
01:58:51,215 --> 01:58:55,636
Till this murder is done,
let's use code names.

1373
01:58:55,803 --> 01:58:58,388
Your name is Lakshmi,
my name is Tulasi.

1374
01:58:58,555 --> 01:58:59,723
My name is Nagavalli.

1375
01:59:00,808 --> 01:59:03,393
CP's time is over.

1376
01:59:03,685 --> 01:59:06,438
Time is elapsing,
come to exchange proposals.

1377
01:59:06,605 --> 01:59:08,190
Just now I got information
from Intelligence.

1378
01:59:08,357 --> 01:59:10,025
That's for later,
first exchange the offers.

1379
01:59:10,192 --> 01:59:11,902
Engagement is cancelled.

1380
01:59:12,069 --> 01:59:12,820
Hey girl, get up.

1381
01:59:12,986 --> 01:59:15,364
What happened?
- You love someone, right?

1382
01:59:15,531 --> 01:59:17,574
She isn't like that.
- Move away!

1383
01:59:17,825 --> 01:59:21,912
Do you love someone or not?
- Yes, but no problem.

1384
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:23,747
No problem for me too,
it's okay to me.

1385
01:59:23,914 --> 01:59:25,582
You said experience is good.

1386
01:59:25,749 --> 01:59:27,209
Shut up.
- He says no problem.

1387
01:59:27,376 --> 01:59:29,503
I respect women and
their aspirations.

1388
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:33,590
Find her lover and marry her to him.
- Okay sir.

1389
01:59:33,757 --> 01:59:35,217
No, I want this girl only, mummy.

1390
01:59:35,384 --> 01:59:38,554
Shut up, you fool!
Do you want her?

1391
01:59:44,351 --> 01:59:46,937
Not only Home Minister,
other guests are foreign delegates.

1392
01:59:47,104 --> 01:59:49,690
Check everyone's ID card
and allow them.

1393
01:59:54,945 --> 01:59:56,196
Boot is too small!

1394
01:59:57,948 --> 02:00:00,367
What's the checking?

1395
02:00:01,326 --> 02:00:05,789
Checking is on.
- Manage it.

1396
02:00:05,956 --> 02:00:07,124
You're Home Minister, right?

1397
02:00:07,708 --> 02:00:08,709
Isn't it?

1398
02:00:12,045 --> 02:00:13,964
Planned first murder,

1399
02:00:14,715 --> 02:00:17,217
if you both are found,
then I'm also caught.

1400
02:00:17,384 --> 02:00:18,927
How many murders
have you committed till now?

1401
02:00:19,094 --> 02:00:20,304
Never counted it.

1402
02:00:21,763 --> 02:00:22,806
What's it?

1403
02:00:23,682 --> 02:00:26,310
Why are they checking Chief Secretary
and my car too?

1404
02:00:26,477 --> 02:00:28,770
We've to check your car too.

1405
02:00:28,937 --> 02:00:29,980
Will you check my car too?

1406
02:00:30,147 --> 02:00:31,982
Why my car?
I'm the Home Minister.

1407
02:00:32,149 --> 02:00:33,817
Central Govt. order.

1408
02:00:34,359 --> 02:00:35,986
Unnecessarily we got into his car.

1409
02:00:39,114 --> 02:00:40,574
I'm hungry, I'll have a biscuit.

1410
02:00:40,741 --> 02:00:42,326
What's this?
- Please cooperate.

1411
02:00:42,493 --> 02:00:44,495
Want me to stand here,
you carry on.

1412
02:00:46,955 --> 02:00:49,500
Dogs are here for biscuits.

1413
02:00:52,503 --> 02:00:55,672
My surname is on you.
Dogs are seeking vengeance.

1414
02:00:55,839 --> 02:00:57,674
What's inside the boot, sir?
- Shut up.

1415
02:00:58,008 --> 02:01:00,093
Why are the dogs barking
at your car?

1416
02:01:00,385 --> 02:01:01,345
It'll bark.
- Please open the boot.

1417
02:01:01,512 --> 02:01:05,349
Open it! Check my boot too.

1418
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:08,477
First officer to check
boot of Home Minister.

1419
02:01:08,644 --> 02:01:10,103
I think he'll get us into trouble.

1420
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:12,064
Shut up.
- Check.

1421
02:01:12,231 --> 02:01:14,191
Shall I lift it?
- Okay sir.

1422
02:01:14,608 --> 02:01:15,275
Go!

1423
02:01:23,408 --> 02:01:25,202
Greetings Minister.
Welcome.

1424
02:01:25,369 --> 02:01:27,287
Nothing short in welcoming.

1425
02:01:27,538 --> 02:01:28,455
Take it.

1426
02:01:29,832 --> 02:01:30,457
Are you fine, sir?

1427
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:34,211
You saw me fully and
asking how am I?

1428
02:01:34,378 --> 02:01:36,964
What have I seen?
- Naked truth!

1429
02:01:37,131 --> 02:01:40,300
Your CP channel shows it, right?

1430
02:01:40,467 --> 02:01:42,177
I'm opening CP channels
in 10 countries.

1431
02:01:42,344 --> 02:01:45,305
You will open...
open everything!

1432
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,057
You'll open for everything.

1433
02:02:30,559 --> 02:02:32,519
My heart slipped not ID!

1434
02:02:55,459 --> 02:02:59,296
Your work and your channels
are making me go to loo.

1435
02:02:59,463 --> 02:03:00,547
Let's go.

1436
02:03:01,465 --> 02:03:03,717
Come to toilet.
- I'm not getting it.

1437
02:03:03,884 --> 02:03:05,719
He says no, don't put
pressure on him, sir.

1438
02:03:05,886 --> 02:03:07,221
You come.

1439
02:03:07,387 --> 02:03:10,224
Lakshmi, I've failed,
you do something.

1440
02:03:19,274 --> 02:03:21,235
Bring CP to toilet at any cost.

1441
02:03:21,401 --> 02:03:24,404
Will he come for us?
If he feels like he'll come.

1442
02:03:25,447 --> 02:03:26,657
Tell him this, he'll come.

1443
02:03:27,157 --> 02:03:28,408
For this?
- Yes.

1444
02:03:40,254 --> 02:03:41,171
You killed them, right?

1445
02:03:46,552 --> 02:03:48,428
Money...channels!

1446
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:56,353
Observe security cameras.

1447
02:03:58,355 --> 02:04:02,776
An American and China man's ID's
were stolen and locked up in room.

1448
02:04:17,875 --> 02:04:19,960
He's coming!

1449
02:04:27,176 --> 02:04:28,802
Come CP...come.

1450
02:04:29,803 --> 02:04:32,473
When I called you didn't come,
is it urgent now?

1451
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:34,725
I've been watching you,

1452
02:04:34,892 --> 02:04:37,644
you're talking nonsense
with some ulterior motive.

1453
02:04:37,811 --> 02:04:40,230
Did you do which humans do?

1454
02:04:40,397 --> 02:04:43,484
He'll tell you what you've
to do clearly.

1455
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:47,738
Tell him clearly!

1456
02:04:48,071 --> 02:04:51,158
CP channel...naked truth!

1457
02:04:51,366 --> 02:04:52,826
Film it...show it...

1458
02:05:01,168 --> 02:05:02,669
Is it you Nagavalli?

1459
02:05:03,253 --> 02:05:05,672
You change get ups in seconds.

1460
02:05:05,839 --> 02:05:07,257
Is your job done inside?

1461
02:05:10,928 --> 02:05:12,763
I must get Rs.1 crore reward.

1462
02:06:05,482 --> 02:06:06,233
Who are you?

1463
02:06:18,245 --> 02:06:22,749
My father's honesty,
the trust he had on you,

1464
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,751
truth which this world
should know,

1465
02:06:24,918 --> 02:06:26,420
you sold it to Nana bhai,

1466
02:06:26,587 --> 02:06:28,338
you killed my uncle.

1467
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:31,425
Are you Raghuram's son?

1468
02:06:31,842 --> 02:06:34,845
Nana and you're planning bomb blasts,
where are you planting it?

1469
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,181
Don't say you don't know.

1470
02:06:40,976 --> 02:06:43,353
I planned the blasts.

1471
02:06:43,854 --> 02:06:46,607
If I get profit, I'll plan
any number of blasts.

1472
02:06:46,773 --> 02:06:48,609
For money only I sold your father,

1473
02:06:48,775 --> 02:06:52,988
his worthless honesty,
for crores to Nana bhai.

1474
02:06:53,864 --> 02:06:56,366
Now, you'll die in my hands.

1475
02:07:01,663 --> 02:07:02,623
He's Shadow!

1476
02:07:05,292 --> 02:07:06,335
He'll kill me.

1477
02:07:06,502 --> 02:07:08,879
I need to get information from him.

1478
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:17,114
Job is over. I'll tell Tulasi to announce
Rs.1 crore reward.

1479
02:08:20,367 --> 02:08:24,538
Tulasi, I'm Nagavalli here.
Announce Rs.1 crore reward.

1480
02:08:25,539 --> 02:08:26,290
No ned of this stench
after job is done.

1481
02:08:28,959 --> 02:08:31,587
Who is Tulasi? Who is Nagavalli?

1482
02:08:39,386 --> 02:08:43,056
Please check the number
you've dialed.

1483
02:08:50,898 --> 02:08:51,899
Be careful.

1484
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:56,737
You finished him.

1485
02:08:56,904 --> 02:09:00,783
But Tulasi is not answering my calls.
He's rejecting it.

1486
02:09:00,949 --> 02:09:02,659
Let's go to his home with press.

1487
02:09:02,826 --> 02:09:05,162
You surrender and
I'll take the reward.

1488
02:09:05,871 --> 02:09:07,748
Who will surrender?
- What?

1489
02:09:07,915 --> 02:09:09,416
Who helped to commit the murder?
- I did.

1490
02:09:09,583 --> 02:09:11,251
You must also get punished, right?

1491
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:15,005
Surrender and go to gallows.

1492
02:09:15,172 --> 02:09:22,513
Don't go against Nagavalli.
At times I'm scared of myself.

1493
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:28,852
Though you know everything,
you can't do anything.

1494
02:09:30,771 --> 02:09:37,444
You'll see the revenge of Nagavalli!

1495
02:09:42,324 --> 02:09:44,284
CP was killed by Shadow, sir.

1496
02:09:46,787 --> 02:09:49,373
That's why special officer Chakravarthi
is coming from Delhi.

1497
02:09:53,418 --> 02:09:55,003
Mother-in-law, I forgot my cap,
please bring it.

1498
02:09:55,170 --> 02:09:56,296
I'm bringing it.

1499
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:57,464
Take it.

1500
02:10:08,475 --> 02:10:10,644
Raghuram's wife is still alive.

1501
02:10:12,396 --> 02:10:14,231
Pratap is her son-in-law.

1502
02:10:15,482 --> 02:10:16,400
He escaped.

1503
02:10:17,067 --> 02:10:18,735
I'll take care of him.

1504
02:10:19,653 --> 02:10:21,071
Keep an eye on his home.

1505
02:10:26,076 --> 02:10:28,579
IB Special Officer
Chakravarthi (Delhi)

1506
02:10:35,752 --> 02:10:38,755
We've conducted Narco test on Lala.

1507
02:10:40,424 --> 02:10:42,843
Where have you planned
to bomb in Hyderabad?

1508
02:10:43,177 --> 02:10:44,344
I don't know.

1509
02:10:47,764 --> 02:10:49,016
Who is your target?

1510
02:10:50,017 --> 02:10:51,185
I don't know.

1511
02:10:51,351 --> 02:10:52,436
Who is your target?

1512
02:10:52,686 --> 02:10:55,022
Who is behind this operation?
Tell me.

1513
02:10:55,522 --> 02:10:57,024
Guru bhai!

1514
02:10:57,191 --> 02:10:59,943
Guru bhai is dead long time ago.

1515
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:01,570
He's telling Guru bhai's name.

1516
02:11:01,737 --> 02:11:04,782
May be he's not dead,
may be he's alive.

1517
02:11:04,948 --> 02:11:05,616
Tell me.

1518
02:11:07,034 --> 02:11:09,369
Commissioner Tyagi confirmed
his death.

1519
02:11:09,536 --> 02:11:11,205
Tyagi could've lied.

1520
02:11:12,956 --> 02:11:16,835
Many truths have come out
after Tyagi and CP's death.

1521
02:11:17,753 --> 02:11:21,799
Both were working for Nana bhai
for 20 years.

1522
02:11:22,508 --> 02:11:24,468
That's why Shadow may have
killed them.

1523
02:11:26,762 --> 02:11:29,389
Any news about Shadow?
- No.

1524
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:31,391
I've studied the case file,

1525
02:11:31,892 --> 02:11:34,436
whether he murders or
changes the places,

1526
02:11:34,603 --> 02:11:37,731
change men or countries,
there's one thing common,

1527
02:11:37,898 --> 02:11:40,484
did you observe it?
- What's that?

1528
02:11:42,653 --> 02:11:43,403
You!

1529
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:46,281
He's your shadow.

1530
02:11:53,914 --> 02:11:57,334
Every man you target,
Shadow kills them.

1531
02:11:58,502 --> 02:11:59,920
You were there in every
place he killed them.

1532
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:02,923
I'm sure you'd know him very well.

1533
02:12:05,509 --> 02:12:07,678
Your next target is Guru bhai.

1534
02:12:11,974 --> 02:12:15,352
Better try to catch him
before Shadow kills him.

1535
02:12:23,443 --> 02:12:25,404
Why is he after Nana's gang?

1536
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:27,030
His motive could be revenge.

1537
02:12:27,197 --> 02:12:30,284
But he's doing it very intelligently.

1538
02:12:30,868 --> 02:12:32,870
You can catch one who kills openly.

1539
02:12:33,287 --> 02:12:36,874
It's very difficult to catch
a scheming killer.

1540
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,084
Whoever this Shadow is...

1541
02:12:39,251 --> 02:12:42,796
We're doing our duty,
he's doing with an aim.

1542
02:12:47,384 --> 02:12:49,219
Are you here only?

1543
02:12:49,386 --> 02:12:51,472
That day you stabbed him!

1544
02:12:52,473 --> 02:12:54,224
To avoid trouble I'm settling it.

1545
02:12:54,391 --> 02:12:55,809
Is your problem solved?
- Solved.

1546
02:12:55,976 --> 02:12:57,811
Time isn't good.

1547
02:12:58,228 --> 02:12:59,021
This belongs to Pratap,
give it to him.

1548
02:12:59,188 --> 02:13:01,064
Do you give gifts too?

1549
02:13:05,861 --> 02:13:08,655
He's here only and
they're taking us all over city.

1550
02:13:08,822 --> 02:13:09,656
They're eye witnesses, sir.

1551
02:13:09,823 --> 02:13:11,158
It seems you're taking us
all over the city.

1552
02:13:11,325 --> 02:13:12,159
Did you really see Shadow or not?

1553
02:13:12,326 --> 02:13:14,745
It seems you all are together
and fixed a deal.

1554
02:13:14,912 --> 02:13:15,746
Deal?

1555
02:13:15,913 --> 02:13:18,582
He gave cap and computer as gift.
- Who?

1556
02:13:18,749 --> 02:13:21,668
Shadow! He went out just now.
- Shadow?

1557
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,587
He was wearing black dress
but fair complexion like you.

1558
02:13:23,754 --> 02:13:25,506
Sir, security cameras are
not working.

1559
02:13:26,006 --> 02:13:27,007
Sir, your cap!

1560
02:13:27,174 --> 02:13:29,760
He fooled us, we can't catch him.

1561
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:36,266
Guru bhai is still alive.

1562
02:13:36,433 --> 02:13:38,393
Inquire his hideout in old city.

1563
02:13:38,727 --> 02:13:40,604
Let's find his hideout
and trap him.

1564
02:14:14,429 --> 02:14:16,223
I tried to trap Gabbar Singh...

1565
02:14:16,390 --> 02:14:18,559
But gave up because he's little mad...

1566
02:14:21,770 --> 02:14:23,605
I tried to trap business man...

1567
02:14:23,772 --> 02:14:26,066
Gave up because he's too busy...

1568
02:14:29,278 --> 02:14:30,904
I tried to trap Kantri...

1569
02:14:31,071 --> 02:14:32,823
Gave up getting worried...

1570
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:36,827
I tried for darling but
gave up for his daring attitude...

1571
02:15:44,353 --> 02:15:49,024
I gave up dating Bollywood stars...

1572
02:15:51,777 --> 02:15:55,656
I've a great following...

1573
02:15:55,823 --> 02:15:59,284
Don't go overboard,
you're not that worth...

1574
02:15:59,451 --> 02:16:02,996
Don't boast about having
many fans...

1575
02:16:03,163 --> 02:16:07,209
Don't yap about your greatness,
it's painful to hear...

1576
02:16:07,376 --> 02:16:10,671
Hey you Chanti, don't consider me
as your enemy...

1577
02:16:20,139 --> 02:16:22,182
It's twinkling and shining...

1578
02:16:23,892 --> 02:16:26,019
Everything else is milky...

1579
02:16:55,132 --> 02:16:59,720
I'm a winning horse,
you're my jockey...

1580
02:17:02,513 --> 02:17:06,267
Let's love,
come on Raja of Bobbili...

1581
02:17:06,434 --> 02:17:09,937
You've come like a bull
on harvest festival...

1582
02:17:10,105 --> 02:17:13,442
You gave a drink filled
with love...

1583
02:17:13,609 --> 02:17:17,529
You're very lucky to get
the post of my lover...

1584
02:17:17,696 --> 02:17:21,408
You liked me and
I'm under the lime light...

1585
02:17:57,986 --> 02:18:02,032
Cheating police with your death,
are you planning blasts in city?

1586
02:18:02,199 --> 02:18:04,201
I'll kill you, bloody!

1587
02:18:23,469 --> 02:18:27,390
Why did you gun down police officers?

1588
02:18:27,558 --> 02:18:29,893
You saved my life.

1589
02:18:30,227 --> 02:18:31,145
Who are you?

1590
02:18:32,771 --> 02:18:34,815
They killed my family in
an encounter.

1591
02:18:35,190 --> 02:18:37,317
You're in danger,
that's why I saved you.

1592
02:18:37,651 --> 02:18:41,989
You're a lion!

1593
02:18:42,239 --> 02:18:44,324
What do you do? What do you want?

1594
02:18:44,491 --> 02:18:47,161
If you pay me,
I'll kill anyone.

1595
02:18:47,326 --> 02:18:51,998
I did it free for you. I want work.
- Work?

1596
02:18:52,165 --> 02:18:54,876
My gang needs men like you.

1597
02:18:55,043 --> 02:18:57,754
I'm Nana bhai's right hand man.

1598
02:18:58,004 --> 02:19:00,089
I'll take you to top position.

1599
02:19:00,257 --> 02:19:02,176
Nana left country years ago.

1600
02:19:02,342 --> 02:19:05,596
He's coming...
Nana bhai is coming.

1601
02:19:07,347 --> 02:19:08,724
Keep this phone.

1602
02:19:08,891 --> 02:19:11,768
If this rings, Nana bhai has arrived.

1603
02:19:11,934 --> 02:19:14,020
Your job is confirmed.

1604
02:19:14,188 --> 02:19:17,316
You're a lion! Bye.

1605
02:19:18,984 --> 02:19:21,779
Did he believe you?
- Totally. Come.

1606
02:19:27,868 --> 02:19:31,371
One thing is common,
in every place you were there.

1607
02:19:46,136 --> 02:19:48,055
I think you know him well.

1608
02:19:56,271 --> 02:19:57,731
He's your shadow.

1609
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:00,734
Mother!

1610
02:20:02,152 --> 02:20:02,986
What's it, Raja?

1611
02:20:03,153 --> 02:20:05,572
Nana bhai is coming
to Hyderabad tomorrow.

1612
02:20:05,989 --> 02:20:07,491
I'm going to meet him.

1613
02:20:08,492 --> 02:20:10,911
Father's last words are still
ringing in my ears, mother.

1614
02:20:12,162 --> 02:20:17,417
For public cause,
kill or get killed.

1615
02:20:25,175 --> 02:20:26,593
Are you here for pudding?

1616
02:20:27,469 --> 02:20:28,345
No.

1617
02:20:28,512 --> 02:20:29,847
Why are you here then?

1618
02:20:30,347 --> 02:20:31,598
To talk to mother...

1619
02:20:33,308 --> 02:20:36,436
You like guns, right?
- I like.

1620
02:20:36,603 --> 02:20:38,605
You like to kill humans, right?

1621
02:20:40,357 --> 02:20:41,442
Kill?

1622
02:20:41,608 --> 02:20:49,450
Shakeel uncle, Robert uncle,
Jeeva uncle, Tyagi uncle.

1623
02:20:49,616 --> 02:20:51,952
Recently CP uncle.

1624
02:20:53,912 --> 02:20:55,414
Isn't it you who killed them?

1625
02:20:55,622 --> 02:20:58,125
What are you saying?
Chanti killed them?

1626
02:20:58,292 --> 02:21:00,794
He's not Chanti but Shadow!

1627
02:21:03,881 --> 02:21:05,048
You're caught!

1628
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:10,304
Nobody can stop me
till I kill Nana bhai.

1629
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:20,564
You're committing a mistake.

1630
02:21:38,665 --> 02:21:42,503
Raja, he mustn't live.

1631
02:21:49,593 --> 02:21:51,845
You're safe, right?
- He escaped.

1632
02:21:52,012 --> 02:21:56,934
Escaped? You sent him out.
- Did I send him out?

1633
02:21:57,142 --> 02:21:58,977
I saw it.

1634
02:21:59,144 --> 02:22:00,354
Did aunt send him out?

1635
02:22:00,813 --> 02:22:04,358
Yes, I saw my mother
giving him the knife.

1636
02:22:05,609 --> 02:22:09,029
Why did you do it?
Tell me mother, why?

1637
02:22:09,279 --> 02:22:11,907
Because he's your brother Raja!

1638
02:22:16,912 --> 02:22:22,209
What you are saying is...
- Yes, Shadow is my son Raja.

1639
02:22:25,045 --> 02:22:27,464
What I did may be crime for you.

1640
02:22:28,340 --> 02:22:32,052
But I did what a mother would do.

1641
02:22:32,845 --> 02:22:36,807
My son will kill Nana bhai.

1642
02:22:37,307 --> 02:22:41,812
Shadow is your wife's brother,
I can't believe it.

1643
02:22:42,104 --> 02:22:43,647
I'm not thinking about that.

1644
02:22:43,897 --> 02:22:46,066
We couldn't find where they
had planned to bomb!

1645
02:22:48,152 --> 02:22:49,820
I'll present him to court.

1646
02:22:49,987 --> 02:22:52,156
He'll come out on bail.

1647
02:22:59,163 --> 02:23:03,417
Acharya's meeting is cancelled
due to trouble in Bangalore,

1648
02:23:03,584 --> 02:23:04,751
it has been shifted to Hyderabad,

1649
02:23:04,918 --> 02:23:08,589
it has been arranged in
Gymkhana grounds tomorrow at 5 pm.

1650
02:23:11,341 --> 02:23:14,595
Tomorrow evening meeting,
come in lakhs and millions.

1651
02:23:14,761 --> 02:23:17,222
Join forces against corruption.

1652
02:23:17,389 --> 02:23:22,436
Ending corruption is Acharyaji's aim!

1653
02:23:23,979 --> 02:23:25,606
What can we do in short time?

1654
02:23:25,814 --> 02:23:28,108
People turn up in thousands
for Acharyaji.

1655
02:23:28,358 --> 02:23:29,777
What if any untoward
incident happens?

1656
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:35,199
Tomorrow is October 2!
- So what?

1657
02:23:35,991 --> 02:23:37,367
This is red October!

1658
02:23:38,118 --> 02:23:40,204
Nana bhai's target is this meeting.

1659
02:23:41,413 --> 02:23:42,289
He's planning blast there.

1660
02:24:42,474 --> 02:24:48,689
You're the first police officer
to give me tension.

1661
02:25:02,411 --> 02:25:03,704
Bloody man is dead!

1662
02:25:06,915 --> 02:25:07,708
Brother!

1663
02:25:11,253 --> 02:25:15,340
We've removed 5 bullets from his body.
We've done everything as doctors.

1664
02:25:15,507 --> 02:25:17,050
It's up to him!

1665
02:25:33,650 --> 02:25:34,485
Brother!

1666
02:25:40,407 --> 02:25:42,659
Why God is so unjust, brother?

1667
02:25:44,244 --> 02:25:47,080
He took away father
when I was little girl,

1668
02:25:48,582 --> 02:25:50,501
he kept you away from me
for years,

1669
02:25:52,169 --> 02:25:54,588
now that you're here...

1670
02:25:55,506 --> 02:25:56,673
He's...

1671
02:25:56,840 --> 02:26:01,512
No dear...nothing will
happen to brother-in-law.

1672
02:26:02,471 --> 02:26:03,931
Brother-in-law will be fine.

1673
02:26:15,442 --> 02:26:19,613
Brother, good news!
Nana bhai is here!

1674
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:20,948
I've told him about you.

1675
02:26:21,615 --> 02:26:22,699
I'll arrange meeting with him.

1676
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:25,494
I'm also waiting to meet Nana bhai.

1677
02:26:26,662 --> 02:26:29,706
Raja, Nana bhai's men have
kidnapped mother.

1678
02:26:56,400 --> 02:26:56,900
Who is she?

1679
02:26:57,067 --> 02:27:01,405
She's mother of Shadow
who gave us tension.

1680
02:27:02,531 --> 02:27:07,202
My partner CP spent a fortune
for these blasts.

1681
02:27:08,036 --> 02:27:11,999
Where's Shadow who disturbed
us by killing our men?

1682
02:27:12,166 --> 02:27:15,335
Wherever he may be,
he'll surely come for her.

1683
02:27:15,836 --> 02:27:21,425
Bombs will go off in an hour,
Acharyaji will die.

1684
02:27:22,468 --> 02:27:23,677
My dream will come true.

1685
02:27:23,844 --> 02:27:25,596
Watch a sample.

1686
02:27:31,226 --> 02:27:33,687
This is just 100 grams only!
Just a sample!

1687
02:27:35,773 --> 02:27:38,108
Yours is 100 kilogram blast!

1688
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:40,360
Be careful.

1689
02:27:42,654 --> 02:27:43,363
Keep it.

1690
02:27:44,072 --> 02:27:48,368
They're loading RDX into vans.
Park vans near the stage.

1691
02:27:49,328 --> 02:27:52,039
Press this remote from
a kilometer away.

1692
02:27:53,373 --> 02:27:54,291
This is enough for me.

1693
02:27:54,458 --> 02:27:57,503
After Acharyaji's death,
it'll generate sympathy wave for me.

1694
02:27:58,378 --> 02:28:02,174
Anyone I point as his disciple
would become MLA and MP!

1695
02:28:02,341 --> 02:28:05,135
I don't want position.
I want only political power.

1696
02:28:05,385 --> 02:28:07,179
I want to become a king maker!

1697
02:28:07,346 --> 02:28:08,889
What you think will not happen!

1698
02:28:09,431 --> 02:28:11,058
My son will not let it happen!

1699
02:28:24,488 --> 02:28:30,661
Bhai, he's the lion,
who saved me from police.

1700
02:28:35,749 --> 02:28:37,668
Guru told me about your guts.

1701
02:28:37,835 --> 02:28:40,003
I'll take you to top,
work loyally.

1702
02:28:40,170 --> 02:28:42,589
If you want loyalty, rear dogs.

1703
02:28:42,756 --> 02:28:46,343
I'm lion, I know only to hunt.

1704
02:28:46,510 --> 02:28:47,970
There's fire in his words.

1705
02:28:48,137 --> 02:28:49,513
I'll show it my deeds too.

1706
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:54,268
Bhai, he's very useful to us.
He'll take care of the Shadow.

1707
02:28:55,018 --> 02:28:56,937
Take it as we got Shadow!

1708
02:28:57,146 --> 02:28:59,648
Because the man who knows him,
the man who saw him,

1709
02:28:59,815 --> 02:29:03,527
the man who heard his story,
Narsing is bringing him here.

1710
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:14,955
He's that mental doctor.

1711
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,209
It's a tradition for
mafia dons, right?

1712
02:29:19,376 --> 02:29:21,295
I've seen in many films.

1713
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,966
Why is she here?
- Shadow's mother. Don't you know this?

1714
02:29:26,467 --> 02:29:27,384
Shadow's mother?

1715
02:29:27,551 --> 02:29:31,221
His mother was in opposite house,
why did he stay with me then?

1716
02:29:31,555 --> 02:29:32,639
He can do anything.

1717
02:29:32,806 --> 02:29:34,057
Do you know anything about Shadow?

1718
02:29:34,224 --> 02:29:36,977
Shadow loves sweets, lollipops
and chocolates!

1719
02:29:37,144 --> 02:29:39,396
He appears funny but
kills cunningly.

1720
02:29:39,563 --> 02:29:42,983
Stay with us till we find Shadow.

1721
02:29:43,150 --> 02:29:45,110
I'll stay here till
his funeral is over.

1722
02:29:45,277 --> 02:29:48,697
Stop that nonsense,
can you recognise Shadow?

1723
02:29:48,864 --> 02:29:50,491
I can recognise his shadow also!
- Can you recognise?

1724
02:29:50,657 --> 02:29:52,826
His voice too is just like that.

1725
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:56,371
Did you see?

1726
02:29:56,914 --> 02:29:58,332
Did you see Shadow?

1727
02:29:59,041 --> 02:30:00,501
Can you recognise him?

1728
02:30:01,043 --> 02:30:03,754
Don't embarrass us, tell him.

1729
02:30:04,129 --> 02:30:05,923
Why don't you answer him?

1730
02:30:06,131 --> 02:30:08,759
Which are you from?
Don't you've head and brain?

1731
02:30:08,926 --> 02:30:10,886
You're not a don but butter nan

1732
02:30:11,053 --> 02:30:14,181
Look at your suit, boot and style!
Great Nana bhai!

1733
02:30:14,348 --> 02:30:16,600
Big build up!
Shadow will kill you!

1734
02:30:16,767 --> 02:30:20,437
Stop that nonsense!
Where is Shadow?

1735
02:30:20,604 --> 02:30:25,692
He's omnipotent and omnipresent!

1736
02:30:25,859 --> 02:30:28,112
Don't I've shadow?
Don't you've shadow?

1737
02:30:28,278 --> 02:30:35,035
Doesn't he have a shadow?
Shadow will kill you!

1738
02:30:36,245 --> 02:30:37,871
I trusted you!

1739
02:30:40,290 --> 02:30:41,542
No need of anyone's help!

1740
02:30:42,793 --> 02:30:47,214
Shadow will come here
for his mother.

1741
02:31:01,145 --> 02:31:01,895
Take it.

1742
02:31:03,772 --> 02:31:04,898
Kill Shadow!

1743
02:31:21,081 --> 02:31:22,583
Will you sell our country?

1744
02:31:28,672 --> 02:31:31,675
Why are you following me?
Go out and kill him.

1745
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:44,938
Come!

1746
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:54,948
Is Shadow here?
- Shut up!

1747
02:32:07,169 --> 02:32:08,670
Is power cut or am I dead?

1748
02:32:08,837 --> 02:32:10,172
Not power cut, he cut the power.

1749
02:32:10,339 --> 02:32:12,841
Who? You said you know him, right?
Shadow is here!

1750
02:32:13,008 --> 02:32:16,053
How can he come? He's here already!
- Is he here?

1751
02:32:16,678 --> 02:32:18,722
Did you see Shadow?
Can you recognise him?

1752
02:32:18,889 --> 02:32:20,891
The man who asked me this
is Shadow!

1753
02:32:21,058 --> 02:32:21,642
He's Shadow!

1754
02:32:32,736 --> 02:32:36,073
How violent it would be
after this silence!

1755
02:32:57,928 --> 02:32:58,762
Are you Shadow?

1756
02:33:08,605 --> 02:33:10,023
Kill him boys!

1757
02:33:50,981 --> 02:33:53,317
Are you Shadow?

1758
02:34:27,226 --> 02:34:28,185
I got Shadow!

1759
02:34:49,957 --> 02:34:53,627
Your son Shadow is dead!

1760
02:34:54,461 --> 02:34:57,756
Dead man is not my son,

1761
02:34:57,923 --> 02:35:00,134
the man who killed him
is my son.

1762
02:35:02,845 --> 02:35:05,472
He'll show me your killing!

1763
02:35:28,912 --> 02:35:30,164
Are you Shadow?

1764
02:35:30,330 --> 02:35:32,499
You killed my father as I watched.

1765
02:35:33,167 --> 02:35:35,919
I made you kill your own brother.

1766
02:36:16,001 --> 02:36:18,796
Forgive me!
Please leave me.

1767
02:36:18,962 --> 02:36:21,799
I didn't search you for
20 long years to spare!

1768
02:36:21,965 --> 02:36:23,801
To kill you!

1769
02:36:58,919 --> 02:36:59,753
Come brother-in-law.

1770
02:37:00,671 --> 02:37:01,755
My brother-in-law, sir.

1771
02:37:02,047 --> 02:37:02,756
My brother!

1772
02:37:02,923 --> 02:37:04,341
Recently he came to India.
