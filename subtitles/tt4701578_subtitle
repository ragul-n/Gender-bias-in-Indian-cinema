Defence Lawyer of
Tanuka Sen's Divorce Case.

39
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:35,829
Sumanta always use to like Priyanka
but she likes her boss Joy Chowdhury.

40
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,246
Sumanta has been defeated
till date by Joy Chowdhury.

41
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:42,996
That's why he is slapped by his mother.

42

Why? It's an odd time.

54
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,621

00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,537
It's too far away from you. An idiot.

60
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,329
Mother, I am not an idiot.

61
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,662
I am taking oath in
name of my late father.

62
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:45,204
This time I will win
this Tanuka Sen's case.

63
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:46,496
Who is Tanuka Sen?

64
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:48,204

65
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:51,537

00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:57,037
Please watch me today properly sir.
Please watch me properly.

67
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,371
His advocate Joy Chowdhury
is always absent.

68
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,787
And she always brings the dates.

69
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:08,579
So I am not happy in my married life.

70
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:11,121
He couldn't even get me an issue.

71
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:17,121
He can't do anything sir.
Please give me that...

72
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,746
I mean today please make a decision sir.

73
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,662

74
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,371
I mean please stop saying.

75
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:28,329
Yes Miss Priyanka!

76
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:29,371
Sir!

77
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:34,246
She is Priyanka Dhali.
Joy Chowdhury's assistant.

78
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:36,746
Chirming, always speaks continuously.

79
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:40,912
Her mother Vishnupriya
died a long time ago.

80
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,329
Want to see that picture?

81
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:52,246
She is Priyanka's mother whom his
Mr. Dhanakrishna Dhali worships regularly.

82
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,454
He believes that one day
Vishnupriya will surely come back.

83
00:09:56,912 --> 00:10:02,954
He is blind but his specialty is
that he can smell and identify anything.

84
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,829
This is just today in morning.

85
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,662
Hey please leave me.

86
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:16,579
Oh shit. That's Mr. Dhanakrishna.
He cannot see anything.

87
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,496
We call him Dhan Da.

88
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:19,996
Please come dear.

89
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,704
Hey is that Tapan?

90
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:25,204
Yes Dhan Da it's me.

91
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:27,746
What are doing here
at time of selling fish?

92
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:29,746
Dhan Da I have come to toilet.

93
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,537
First toilet then kiss
or first kiss then toilet?

94
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:34,996
Oh My God!

95
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,246
He has set a microscope in his nose.

96
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,371
Listen you earn quite good selling fish.

97
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:43,496
Then why don't you kiss Sabita's
daughter Laali inside the Cinema Halls?

98
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,371
Then you don't need to toilet here.

99
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:48,329
Oh My God!
By smell he has identified me also.

100
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,079
Yes.

101
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:50,621
What a peculiar Dhan?

102
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,787
This famous person has an
only daughter which is Priyanka.

103
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,162
Priyanka Dhali.

104
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:58,704
Sir, the thing is that Joy...

105
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,912
Understood.
Mr. Joy could not come.

106
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,621
So you need another date right?

107
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,541
Yes Sir.

108
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,454
Suddenly he had to leave for Mumbai.

109
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:07,954
On next date he definitely will be here.

110
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:10,204
It's okay. I am giving...

111
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:11,996
Objection Milord...

112
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,454
Since he is afraid of me
to get defeated in this case...

113
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,246
...he is showing excuses back to back.

114
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:20,204
Showing medicals...
My only request to you Milord.

115
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,579
Please make the final decision today here.

116
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:26,246
At a time 25 lakhs and
the residence on Saifle Road.

117
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,871
Please save me sir. Please save me.

118
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,746
Otherwise I will be on...

119
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,829
Ah! You please stop it.

120
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:36,287
I mean sir I will be on road.

121
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,371
You please stop talking.

122
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:41,704
Miss Priyanka I am giving
a date on next month.

123
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:43,746
But it will be the final...

124
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,662
It will be the final date.

125
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,829
Sir?

126
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:50,204
I am not able to understand one thing.

127
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,829
I hope Mr. Joy is not double-crossing me.

128
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:52,662
You don't need to take tension.

129
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,037
So madam, where is he right now?

130
00:11:57,287 --> 00:12:00,579
He will never be able to understand
that I am double crossing him.

131
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,996
You will definitely win this case Tanu.

132
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,037
I love you darling.

133
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:14,162
I will demand 25 lakhs and
this house as my compensation.

134
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:16,287
A single note will not go anywhere.

135
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:18,371
Here you are?

136
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,246
You are double-crossing me.

137
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,329
My house... my wife... my bed...
Why are you using this?

138
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,621
Shut up, he will hundred percent use that.

139
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,662
You are a useless,
just not to use for anything.

140
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,329
Get out from my room. Out!

141
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:31,787
Oh!

142
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:35,037
Why on me?

143
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:39,037
Died?

144
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:42,829
Yes died. He is dead.

145
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,246
Really? Dead?

146
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,162
Oh God! I love you.

147
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:48,246
What?

148
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,746
Yes, he has died falling on me.

149
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:52,537
He got attack after seeing me.

150
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,204
I am so lucky.. so lucky.

151
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:59,162
I have tried a lot to kill him.
Lorry accident. Bike accident.

152
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:02,787
Car accident.. Metro Rail accident..
but I failed every time.

153
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,787
But after seeing us on same bed...
battery down.

154
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,162
Story does not end here.

155
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,662
Hey! Who are you?

156
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,579

00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:24,454
Yes this is Joy Chowdhury.
Divorce specialist.

158
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:27,121
His way of working is totally different.

159
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:30,329
Till date no divorce case
is there where he could be defeated.

160
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:32,996
- Debdas!
- Not Debdas.

161
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,621
Mrs. Tanuka, his name is Sanchit
Chatterjee. He is my assistant.

162
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,954
We were playing a drama with you.

163
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:39,954
Drama?

164
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,829
We are over.

165
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,746
The pictures the conversations everything

166
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:49,496
Now we will put the recording in display.

167
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,454
Please get up Mr. Sen. You acted so well.

168
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:56,287
Don't worry you get your divorce.

169
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:57,871
No need for any compensation.

170
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,329
Yet we will send Mrs. Tanuka
in Criminal Court.

171
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:03,454
No...

172
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:04,454
What no?

173
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,496
This time also... I could not win mother.

174
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:11,912
Come son, come here.

175
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:15,579
Idiot.

176
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,621
Did you say?

177
00:14:27,996 --> 00:14:29,954
What to say? And to whom?

178
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,246
When are you gonna inform
your father regarding our wedding?

179
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,621
Oh the wedding factor?
That will be said.

180
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,329
Look. There are five cases in my hand.

181
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:37,579
Let me handle them first.
Then everything will be sorted out.

182
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:40,662
Shut Up. You've said five cases,
and now it has turned fifty.

183
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:43,121
What do you want actually?

184
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:44,912
When we will reach at
the age of fifty after that...

185
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,121
...you will go to inform you
father regarding our wedding. Right?

186
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,746
Listen. I am giving you the last warning.

187
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,954
This time If you will
not inform your father.

188
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,787
Then I will definitely
marry that idiot Sumanta.

189
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:58,621
No... no, no, no...

of his father too much, get tensed a lot.

195
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,412
What will he say?

God is with us, win will win. "

203
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:53,371

306
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:46,996
It's not Bhombol. It's humble.

307
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:50,912
You never improved in your English

Already in penalty,

339
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,621

344
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:23,412
Why are you standing like a statue?

345

God bless you.

348
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:38,829
Vishnu, when your daughter gets angry,
I remember you, don't mind Vishnu.

349
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:42,412

353
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:57,787
What?

354
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:00,704
Some good things.

355
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:02,579
Good or bad.
I am not interested at all on that.

356
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:04,079
Get out. Get out.

357
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:07,537
Idiot. Say don't be angry Priya.

358
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:08,746
Don't be angry Priya.

359
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:13,162
Good. Now say, I love you Priya.

360
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:14,496
Priya, I love you Priya.

361
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,079
Just write it down
and stick it on wall.

362
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:19,121
The one who stammers at the time
of informing about wedding...

363
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:21,787
...with least confidence
can never love anybody.

364
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:22,954
And never will be able also.

365
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:27,037
Why not use your legs you idiot.
Get inside.

366
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,454
Priya.. Priya give me
one chance Priya.

367
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:31,871
Why? Wanna make a godown of chances?

368
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:35,621
Oh just follow this one how I used to do.
Just give her a tight hug.

369
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:36,787
Priya!

370
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,287
Leave me.

371
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:41,787
Still burning.
Need fire-brigade.

372
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,204
Priya I swear on you.

373
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,537
Now I will marry you after
that I will inform my father.

374
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:47,662
What?

375
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:51,412
You will marry me after
that you will inform your father?

376
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:54,954
No, no my father's childhood friend,
Charandas Palkiwala.

377
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:59,204
His son Bijoy, my friend, his wedding.
I told you about him.

378
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,371
That's why we all are going to Delhi.

379
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:04,621
And after going there I will
tell him about our wedding. Promise.

380
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:09,371
Then okay. Nothing is being done
in a simple way.

381
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:13,079
He won't say here. He needs to go to
Delhi to seek permission. Go to hell.

382
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:51,746
- Mother!
- Yes.

383
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:53,579
I don't think it's a wedding house.

384
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:56,662
Sir. I am sure someone
is no more here.

385
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:58,787
- Shut up.
- Oh God. Don't say like this.

386
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,412
Hey listen.

387
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,787
I think something is wrong here.

388
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,621
I am sure, your friend is not well.

389
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:14,746
Charandas had some knee pains,
I never heard about his chest pains.

390
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,829
Look, there is Giridhari.

391
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,787
Hey Giridhari.

392
00:26:25,787 --> 00:26:28,621
What happened?
Today is Bijoy's wedding ceremony.

393
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:31,912
They are crying. You also are crying.

394
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:37,329
What happened?
Where is he? Say something.

395
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:40,954
Sir. I think he is in a great shock
and has gone dumb.

396
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:42,329
Where is Charandas?

397
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,746
He is saying that his body is inside.

398
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:50,787
Just see, Charandas has left before
seeing his son's wedding. How could he?

399
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:53,746
Bad Luck. Handle him.

400
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:55,287
Come.

401
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:09,496
Look here is Charandas.

402
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:10,787
Then who left?

403
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,829
Then why is he crying
before the Bijoy's photo?

404
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,209
That means the groom has left sir.

405
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,792
Shut up.

406
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,167
Charan.

407
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,417
How is this happened with me Raju?

408
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,084
Say something sister.

409
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:39,250
How Can I?

410
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,375
It's on wedding date.

411
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:47,250
If only it was just two days before...
Now what should I do?

412
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,542
What can you do?
You have to accept the truth.

413
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:54,000
But I can't accept.

414
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:57,084
He was my one and only son.

415
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:01,667
When did it happened exactly?

416
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,542
I just have come to
know today in morning.

417
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,542
In hospital or at home uncle?

418
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:11,500
Why in hospital?
Everything happened here at home.

419
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,792
But where is the body?

420
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,542
If I could get the body
no issue would be there.

421
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,209
But we are not getting
the body at all.

422
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,375
Why? After the murder
vanished his body uncle?

423
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:23,125
That would also be cool dear.

424
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,709
But this letter is
saying something else.

425
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,000
Suicide note?

426
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:30,667
That could also be a matter
but here he has said that...

427
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,667
...he will not be able to
marry the girl whom we have chosen.

428
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,542
He has written unpossible.

429
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,709
It's not unpossible. It's impossible.

430
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,292
Bloody old man but
still can't speak properly.

431
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,542
It's okay.

432
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,209
Tina, the girl whom we've selected
for Bijoy to marry.

433
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:52,917
But he doesn't wish to marry Tina,
who's of our choice.

434
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,125
That's why he has run away
from home early in the morning.

435
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:59,959
He just have made us full dry...

436
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:03,500
Dry... full dry...
full dry... full dry.

437
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:04,959
Don't cry. Don't cry.

438
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,542
Now he has chosen someone Julie.

439
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:11,542
Now he is saying that
he will marry Julie only.

440
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:18,375
But there also a case...
his brother is mafia.

441
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:21,500
He has just made us so shameful.

442
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:25,875
- Hey my naked friend.
- What?

443
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,125
I mean bosom friend.

444
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:32,792
If the wedding timing passes
no one will be able to protect him.

445
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:40,167
Even Raghab gets thrice attack
in a month. What will I say to him?

446
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,542
What will Raghab say to Tina?

447
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,875
What say Raghab?

448
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:48,625
Bad Luck, bad luck.

449
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:50,459
Don't speak this rubbish again.

450
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,125
My one and only daughter's wedding.

451
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,667
Everything should be alright...
I can do anything mind it.

452
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,750
Please calm down. You have
got ninety eight times attack.

453
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,084
I have got ninety eight times.

454
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,667
Now I will get the ninety ninth.

455
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,292
Raghab Roy doesn't care
all these things.

456
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,292
Brother,
something have to say, will I?

457
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,292
Don't make me irritated. Please say.

458
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,042
I have heard something.

459
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,667
May be not sure,
Bijoy has escaped from his home.

460
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,709
Ninety ninth times.

461
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,417
What? Bride groom escaped?

462
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,292
Is he not coming?

463
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,125
Is the marriage stopped?

464
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:34,542
What? Bijoy has escaped?

465
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,125
Yes. This is Tina Roy.

466
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:41,042
One and only loving daughter
of Promoter Raghab Roy.

467
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:44,625
Who is about to marry Bijoy today.

468
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,875
Father. What I am listening father?

469
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:50,959
Bijoy has escaped?
Is he not coming for the wedding?

470
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,042
Don't cry dear.

471
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:56,750
Not only Bijoy,
His father also has to come.

472
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,584
No father.
I can't marry with Bijoy's father.

473
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,709
Oh God! What will happen now?

474
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:06,584
Whatever it will be.
Your wedding will sure done.

475
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,542
Go dear. Go to your room.

476
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,209
- Smita!
- Yes.

477
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:13,792
Take her inside.

478
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,542
Come, come. Don't cry.

479
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,265
Yes... yes... yes.

480
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,459
What happened?

481
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,042
Raghab is calling?
What should I do?

482
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,917
What should you do?
Pick up the call.

483
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,500
No way. I can't take this call.

484
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:47,334
My voice will jerk... body parts
will jerk... everything will jerk.

485
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:48,292
- Useless!
- What?

486
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,584
- Okay. I am taking the call.
- No.

487
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,334
Hello!

488
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,250
- Charan.
- Charan is in bathroom.

489
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:58,459
I am his friend,
Rajballabh speaking. Tell me.

490
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Main thing is that.
I am Raghab's father.

491
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:05,000
I am Tina's father.
I have heard that bridegroom escaped.

492
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:07,959
Whatever you heard. I am telling you,
Bridegroom parties will come...

493
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:10,042
...wedding also will be done.
Now put down the phone.

494
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,750
Oh really?

495
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,459
Dear Shibu... come here.

496
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:16,667
Yes brother.

497
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,167
Bastard.

498
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,917
You have added one
more stroke in my list.

499
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,292
I am telling you this
wedding will be done.

500
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,417
How will it happen? Where is Bijoy?

501
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:37,292
Is Julie able to hear
this flute's sound?

502
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,209
Julie.. by caste Christian...

503
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,542
...but a proper Bengali, whom Bijoy
Palkiwala has fallen in love with.

504
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:49,959
Julie speaks a little bit.
But no compromise in her love.

505
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,875
Bastard.

506
00:32:54,792 --> 00:33:00,792
You can't imagine. But he Julie's
elder brother, Patla Poda.

507
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,959
Patla Poda,
the whole area is afraid of him.

508
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,584
Brother, why are they biting him?

509
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,875
This bastard had made me angry.

510
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,625
He was trying to like Khoshla's sister.

511
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,917
I am Patla Poda.

512
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,209
The one who will take a look
at the mothers and sisters of my gang.

513
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,709
I will make them handicapped
and leave them on the footpath.

514
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,417
Bother... your meal.

515
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,375
Yes give me.

516
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,917
What is she doing there?

517
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,167
Nothing.

518
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,084
Hey why are looking so dry?

519
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:46,625
What happened? Is your health okay?
Or mind is not okay?

520
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:49,959
Hey! Anyone told you anything?
You just tell the name.

521
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,875
I will just cut his legs and...

522
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,750
Brother.. brother...
you know I am your sister...

523
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,375
No one has guts to tell me anything.

524
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:59,625
Yes. Always keep it in your mind.

525
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:04,500
You are my life.
If anyone try to look at you...

526
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:07,709
- Brother!
- Yes.

527
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,000
I am going.

528
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:11,875
Yes you have worked hard.
Just take some rest go, go.

529
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,500
Come.. come.

530
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,459
Why are you out of your car?

531
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:32,250
Why? What happened?

532
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:35,417
If my brother see,
he will make a sandwich of you. Go, go.

533
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:40,334
Ok go.

534
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:41,334
Where will we go?

535
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:42,417
Initially in a hotel?

536
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,417
- Hotel?
- Yes.

537
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,334
If brother comes to know...then?

538
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,709
I have a superb plan.

539
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,667
That father also will
not come to know anything.

540
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:53,542
Plan successful. Bijoy is not coming.

541
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:56,584
Now Shaan and your line is clear.

542
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,375
Tina... Tina.

543
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:10,250
This is Shaan...
A very simple but a clever guy.

544
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,834
He loves Mr. Raghab's daughter Tina
by heart.

545
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Without Tina he life
is like load shedding.

546
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,000
Hey Tina.

547
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,209
Is everything alright?

548
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:25,167
Everything is alright.

549
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,292
You just don't worry.
Bijoy is not coming.

550
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,500
Ohh! Really he is not coming right?
I am very much tensed.

551
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:32,459
I told you that he is not coming.

552
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:37,000
Still if he comes and
marry you then I will...

553
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:38,334
Shut up.

554
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,750
Don't cry like girls.
I will marry only with you.

555
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:44,209
Go and get ready just
like a full bridegroom.

556
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,875
Why? Why like a bridegroom?

557
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,792
Idiot. I told you already.

558
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,167
When my wedding is about to spoil.

559
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,167
You have to enter just then.

560
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:58,292
Understood?

561
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:01,459
Yes understood.

562
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,459
I was saying that in the middle
if anything goes wrong...

563
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,250
...I will definitely suicide.

564
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,750
Suicide is now so far...

565
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:14,625
If you don't come on right
time then I will positively kill you.

566
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,834
Still you are standing?

567
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,042
Go and get ready.

568
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:25,209
Why will I be ready?
Do you expect me to be killed?

569
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,917
Oh! Don't make a mess.

570
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Why not?
You said wedding will be done.

571
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:31,792
So where is the bridegroom?

572
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,000
- Here it's also licking....
- What?

573
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:35,084
Prestige.

574
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:39,459
Until I am here... I will
not let you down my friend Charandas.

575
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,209
This wedding will be done...
After all I am...

576
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:43,209
What?

577
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:44,417
What are you saying?

578
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,000
Still I am here, in this age,
again are you going to marry?

579
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,042
Ohh I am not talking about myself.

580
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:51,750
Then?

581
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,167
Bijoy is not there, no problem.

582
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,584
Remove "Vi" Joy is there.
He will marry Tina.

583
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,375
Oh God.

584
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:01,500
Joy dear protect yourself.

585
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:03,042
What are you saying?

586
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,167
Absolutely correct.

587
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:10,417
Listen. Don't Inform Raghab right
now that the bridegroom has been changed.

588
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,709
Whatever has to say...
I will inform there.

589
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:15,584
Hey who is there?

590
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:18,334
Say, not to play sad songs in Sanai.

591
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:22,750
And tell Band Party
to play happy songs.

592
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:30,459
Joy!

593
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,084
What happened Mother?
Suddenly happy song?

594
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,125
Why not happy song?

595
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:35,625
This wedding is on.

596
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,500
Really? Wedding is on?

597
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:39,625
Bijoy has come? That's fantastic.

598
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,459
Really, he could really
make an excitement.

599
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,375
After listening to the whole story your
excitement is also gonna come out.

600
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:45,917
What does it mean?

601
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,417
Bijoy has not come.

602
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,250
Has not come?

603
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:50,167
No. Your father...

604
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,375
...he has proposed that
he will continue the wedding...

605
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:52,167
...just omitting the letter "Bi" .

606
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,750
Omitting the letter "Bi"?
I didn't get that.

607
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,584
If you omit "Bi", what remains?

608
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,500
If I omit "Bi" remains Joy.

609
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:01,875
Yes. Your father promised
Tina's father that...

610
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,250
...he will manage this
wedding in between Tina and Joy.

611
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:03,834
What?

612
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,625
Mother.. mother.

613
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:08,959
Mother you know that...
I will marry Pi.. Pi...

614
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,667
- Priyanka.
- I will marry Priyanka only.

615
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,167
You please inform father immediately.

616
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,959
I can't marry anyone else.

617
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,084
You go and say your father yourself.

618
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,584
Mother.

619
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,042
Mother you know very well
when I stand before father...

620
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,209
...I always feel uncomfortable.

621
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:21,375
My knees become senseless.

622
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,625
What happened? Whose is afraid here?

623
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,209
I am, father.

624
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:30,125
Just chill. You are going
to marry then why are you so tensed?

625
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:35,500
When I went to marry your
mother I was not at all scared.

626
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:40,542
Hey dear.
Your son want to say you something.

627
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,584
Want to say?

628
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,417
Tell me. What you want to say?

629
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,792
Say what you want.

630
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:51,750
Father now I am Pi.. Pi...

631
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,209
You stupid!
Now from where will I bring your aunt?

632
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,334
It's okay. First complete
your wedding, get back to Kolkata.

633
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,667
Then I will introduce you to
your ninety two years old aunt.

634
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,042
But father.

635
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,625
There is no more but.

636
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,500
Time is running out..
So take it.

637
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:11,709
Now wear these Punjabi clothes.
You and Bijoy are of same size. Yes.

638
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:15,500
Mother!

639
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:17,000
Change yourself a little bit.

640
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:18,374
I'll get mad now.

641
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,000
- Hey what is going on?
- Yes say.

642
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:25,209
What are you seeing?

643
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:29,042
Whatever you are thinking,
that I am not seeing.

644
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,084
I am watching you.
When did you get released?

645
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:34,125
What did you think?

646
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:36,250
- I would be in jail forever.
- Never.

647
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:38,000
I did not get any compensation
just because of you.

648
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,750
- But divorce is final.
- Oh no.

649
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:41,820
You are just a...

650
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,625
Are you finished?
Thank God. Now I am okay.

651
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:55,834
Please come here dear.

652
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,334
Oh that's why you are calling?

653
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,625
That you have shown a lot of times.

654
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:01,750
Slap?

655
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:02,625
You are an idiot.

656
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:03,917
My mother also says that.

657
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
If I would hire an intelligent
advocate like Joy Chowdhury.

658
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:08,417
No one could stop
me to get everything.

659
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,334
You just do one thing.

660
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,542
Leave the courtroom and
sell dhone pata at market.

661
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,834
It's better.

662
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:19,936
Whoever comes... always slap me.

663
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:21,853
Why do they call me idiot?

664
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:24,561
Mother!

665
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:27,561
Mother! Mother!

666
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:30,353
Please let me win at least once.

667
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,645
Help me to get Priyanka.

668
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:40,728
I will pay tribute rupees one...
no eleven.

669
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,561
Mother!! You too.

670
00:40:48,728 --> 00:40:51,436
So cheap... make it at least
one thousand and one rupees.

671
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:54,186
You could say that.

672
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:58,895
One who comes, slaps me and goes away.

673
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:05,645
Everything is for that Joy Chowdhury.

674
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:10,020
Bloody Man... Enjoying in Delhi?

675
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:12,103
I will not spare him.

676
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,270
That's my late father's promise.

677
00:41:14,353 --> 00:41:17,728
I will.. I will.. thrash him
right and left over phone.

678
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:26,853
Hello. Charki speaking.
Who is speaking?

679
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:31,270
- Hey pass the phone to Joy.
- Who Joy? Who is speaking?

680
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:34,686
I am Sumanta from Kolkata.
Pass the phone to Joy now.

681
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:38,728
Oh sir? You should say first.

682
00:41:38,978 --> 00:41:42,936
But the thing is that, it's not possible
to pass the phone to Joy sir today.

683
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,520
Because today is his first
in taking of food ceremony.

684
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,603
What? In taking of food.

685
00:41:46,686 --> 00:41:51,520
Oh no.. no.. no.
Actually today is his wedding.

686
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:53,145

688
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,436
Yes. Instead of Bijoy,
Joy is marrying Tina.

689
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:02,978
Already. I am going as borjatri. Bye.

690
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:05,520

691
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:10,853
Instead of Bijoy, Joy is marrying!

692
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:16,770

693
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:22,186

No, not at all.
Actually he loves his old aunt a lot.

699
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,728
That's why he missing her.

00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:53,770
Get in, we're getting late.

703
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:58,061
Now we need to convince
Raghab Roy too. Extra headache.

704
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:10,270
- Good Evening Mr. Raghab.
- Is everything alright?

705
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:11,520
- Yes.
- Please go inside.

706
00:43:11,603 --> 00:43:12,853
Okay.

707
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:15,895
We are leaving Mr. Raghab.

708
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:19,436
What a caterer. Everything is perfect.

709
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:20,645
Are you done with your dinner?

710
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:22,103
Yes done.

711
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,770
The bridegroom has not come yet.

712
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:28,853
Bridegroom is not so important,
but the dinner must be.

713
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,270
What an item of "Bhetki Fish"!

714
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:34,020
And specially the Mutton item also.

715
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,311
Taking a little bit for
our children also. May we leave?

716
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:39,353
- Yes.
- Come on.

717
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,895
Brother.
The bridegroom has not come yet.

718
00:43:44,978 --> 00:43:45,936
Are you sure
they are not going to turn up.

719
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,770
Third batch is gonna start.

720
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:50,061
There's a mess in dinner table too.

721
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,978
If Bijoy Palkiwala does not come
what are you gonna do?

722
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:56,811
Excuse me. Don't worry. I am here.

723
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:59,478
Hey. You are here means?
What will you do?

724
00:44:00,311 --> 00:44:01,645
I mean what I was said.

725
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:03,270
I mean when the wedding hour
is about to be over.

726
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:04,686
I need to enter and then...

727
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,353
Good news.

728
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,895
Bridegroom's car has come already.

729
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,061
They are nearby to the lane.

730
00:44:10,145 --> 00:44:11,061
Thank God.

731
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:11,978
Thank God.

732
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:14,811
Hey they have come.
Go, go inside and inform them.

733
00:44:14,895 --> 00:44:16,186
Go, go, go, go.

734
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:17,603
The bridegroom has come.

735
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:21,770
That means that bloody Bijoy
has come to marry.

736
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:24,770
Tina is getting married
and I've become a fool?

737
00:44:33,145 --> 00:44:34,603
Hello! Are you ready?

738
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:36,228
Are you kidding me?

739
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:36,936
What?

740
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,853
Didn't you get anyone to make fool?

741
00:44:38,936 --> 00:44:40,061
What rubbish you are talking?

742
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:41,145
I am telling the truth.

743
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,978
That Bijoy has arrived to marry you.

744
00:44:43,061 --> 00:44:44,853
What? Bijoy!

745
00:44:45,311 --> 00:44:48,020
You have made my life a joke Tina.

746
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,353
Now what will I do?

747
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,186
Every time when I tried to
say anything...You interrupted.

748
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,686
"I am trying. I am trying".
Everything is finished.

749
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:57,895
You've played a very good game.

750
00:44:57,978 --> 00:44:59,478
First Bijoy and now you too...
proved me wrong.

751
00:44:59,686 --> 00:45:01,270
Cheating in the name of wedding.

752
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,186
- Shaan!
- Shut up.

753
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:06,436
Shaan!

754
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:08,936
Tina, Tina. Your groom has come.

755
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,395
Your groom has come.

756
00:45:11,686 --> 00:45:13,603
That means Bijoy has cheated me.

757
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:25,228
Let's get down.

758
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:26,770
No way.

759
00:45:27,145 --> 00:45:28,103
Get down.

760
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:28,895
No, no.

761
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:30,311
Oh get down.

762
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,311
Come.. come Charan.
Welcome, welcome.

763
00:45:53,186 --> 00:45:55,145
But how did you get so late?

764
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:56,311
It has been changed bro.

765
00:45:56,395 --> 00:45:59,436
What changed? Where is my son in law?

766
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:01,020
That has been changed.

767
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:02,770
Now you son in law will be that guy.

768
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:05,311
Who?

769
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,103
What? He is fully changed.

770
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:17,728
That's why I was saying.
Did not you listen properly?

771
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:20,853
Is this old man gonna be my son in law?\
Are you joking?

772
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:24,603
There is a chance
to make century also.

773
00:46:24,686 --> 00:46:25,895
Good evening.

774
00:46:26,103 --> 00:46:26,853
Who are you?

775
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:28,186
Me... fortune.

776
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,728
Don't get nervous. Be strong.

777
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:34,228
Look. incidentally the
bridegroom has been changed.

778
00:46:34,811 --> 00:46:36,770
But I am not your son in law.

779
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:40,270
Bijoy has not come.
Instead of him Joy has come.

780
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:42,520
Joy? Instead of Bijoy? What the hell?

781
00:46:42,603 --> 00:46:44,228
Bijoy has escaped early morning.

782
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:45,811
That's why I have
brought his sabastitute.

783
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,561
It's not sabastitute, it's substitute.

784
00:46:49,103 --> 00:46:50,103
Substitute?

785
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:53,353
Is that a football or a cricket match
that you have brought a substitute one?

786
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,478
I am making it clear.

787
00:46:55,936 --> 00:46:58,853
I am retired chief justice
Rajballabh Chowdhury.

788
00:46:59,103 --> 00:47:01,186
I promised you that
bridegroom would come.

789
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,520
So Bijoy has not come. Joy has come.

790
00:47:03,895 --> 00:47:04,978
Wedding is final.

791
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:06,811
Actually what I was saying...

792
00:47:06,895 --> 00:47:09,311
When Bijoy has not come
then what to worry? I am here.

793
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:12,395
Raghab. His son is very nice guy.

794
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:15,645
Bright future.
He is an advocate in High Court.

795
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:17,436
Divorce Specialist.

796
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,478
What? Will he marry
and give divorce also?

797
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:21,395
No, no, no, no. This is not done.
This marriage is cancel.

798
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:25,603
No never. Joy! Get down from the car.

799
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:30,770
Come on. Quick.

800
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,436
Don't get afraid. Come, come.

801
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,520
- This is my son. Joy.
- Is he not handsome?

802
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:43,103
He has everything what my son has.

803
00:47:43,311 --> 00:47:44,770
If you need you can take a test also.

804
00:47:44,853 --> 00:47:45,811
- Doctor!
- Hm.

805
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:47,061
I think another possibility is there.

806
00:47:47,145 --> 00:47:50,061
Don't get afraid, don't get afraid.

807
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,020
Joy is a very good thing.

808
00:47:52,186 --> 00:47:54,186
Joy's power is much more than Bijoy.

809
00:47:54,811 --> 00:47:56,853
Your daughter will
get a very good service.

810
00:47:56,936 --> 00:48:00,103
I have also good power.
I can also provide good services.

811
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:03,728
Is my daughter a service centre that
everybody is gonna provide service?

812
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,520
Hey, hey handle him... Help us.

813
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:12,145
Idiot. After cheating me now
keeping his mobile switched off. Huh!

814
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:14,770
Tina! Your groom has been changed.

815
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:17,186
Groom has been changed means?

816
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,478
Shanti Babu has been agreed?

817
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:20,561
No the situation is totally different.

818
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:22,353
Different?

819
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:24,186
Stay away doctor.

820
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:29,520
It was Joy instead of Bijoy. That's why
got shocked. Now I am fully alright.

821
00:48:30,228 --> 00:48:33,395
Mr. Rajballabh,
what a nice thing of yours?

822
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:34,853
No issue.

823
00:48:35,436 --> 00:48:36,603
That's true.

824
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,436
I was saying Joy,
the girl you are gonna marry with...

825
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,936
...gonna spend your whole life also.

826
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:43,520
Don't you think that
you should talk to her first?

827
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:45,145
Yes right.

828
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:46,936
No, no there is nothing to talk to.

829
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,311
Whatever is to be seen will directly
be on the second night of marriage.

830
00:48:50,686 --> 00:48:54,020
But uncle,
the whole matter has been changed.

831
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,520
Do you think that
Tina will support that?

832
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:57,311
There is a value of her opinion too

833
00:48:57,395 --> 00:48:59,061
Yes, he is right.
Tina doesn't know me...

834
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,061
...how can she marry me suddenly?

835
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:00,853
She is not gonna marry me.

836
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:01,686
Hundred percent she will.

837
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:03,936
If she doesn't marry,
her father will marry.

838
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,936
Then you marry.
Nowadays everything is possible.

839
00:49:06,395 --> 00:49:07,811
Don't be angry dear.

840
00:49:07,895 --> 00:49:08,811
Please listen to me.

841
00:49:08,895 --> 00:49:10,478
I don't want to listen anything.

842
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:12,645
- Greetings, Mr. Raghab!
- Greetings.

843
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:14,395
Come to know that
bridegroom has been changed.

844
00:49:14,478 --> 00:49:15,645
So what about the wedding?

845
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:18,895
If the wedding is finalized then I can
present this gift and go for dinner.

846
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:23,353
Bridegroom has changed. Got it? Now give
your present and go for your dinner.

847
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:24,811
If you want to give the present later...

848
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:28,270
...keep it at side room
and collect a token before going.

849
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:30,436
Oh no. In that case I
am giving this present now.

850
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,311
Please keep it dear.

851
00:49:31,895 --> 00:49:34,270
Keep it. Listen dear.

852
00:49:35,145 --> 00:49:36,520
Only "Bi" is not there.

853
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,811
Bijoy has escaped, Joy has arrived.

854
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:43,061
I will never marry that "Bi" less Joy.
Just let him go to hell.

855
00:49:43,686 --> 00:49:44,686
Okay then return my present please.

856
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:51,478
If you return your gift,
you will be a dog at Kalighat.

857
00:49:51,561 --> 00:49:52,436
Are you threading me?

858
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,936
Yes. Wedding will be done.
You go for dinner.

859
00:49:55,228 --> 00:49:56,811
How peculiar man is this!

860
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:00,686
Listen. My decision is final.

861
00:50:01,353 --> 00:50:04,770
If you want to marry go ahead
otherwise your father will marry.

862
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:14,936
Father, father.

863
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
Father, father.

864
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,520
I think there are no more chances.

865
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:22,311
I am waiting to have
a glimpse of his last breath.

866
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,228
Father.. father please
open your eyes, father.

867
00:50:24,645 --> 00:50:26,270
- Please open your eyes father.
- Please let him die.

868
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:27,686
That will easier for us.

869
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,645
Father please open your
eyes once at least father.

870
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,061
In this life I don't think
these eyes will open any more.

871
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,061
We have to move for last rituals.

872
00:50:36,686 --> 00:50:39,270
Father I will abide
by your all decisions.

873
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:40,686
Father please open your eyes please.

874
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,020
Father please open your eyes please.

875
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,978
Father.

876
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:51,478
Father.. father are
you feeling alright father?

877
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:52,770
Are you okay, father?

878
00:50:53,228 --> 00:50:54,478
Are you ready for this wedding?

879
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:57,478
Yes father,
I will do whatever you will say.

880
00:50:57,895 --> 00:50:59,978
You just don't leave me
this way father.

881
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:01,270
Ok I will not.

882
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:04,353
Doctor, I hope wedding timing
has not passed yet.

883
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,061
No sir, not at all.

884
00:51:06,145 --> 00:51:07,145
Inform Charandas immediately.

885
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,061
This wedding is final.

886
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:51,978
What do you want?

887
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:54,270
I don't want anything.

888
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:57,520
I just want to share a news?

889
00:51:57,603 --> 00:51:58,645
What's the news?

890
00:51:58,728 --> 00:52:02,603
Your Joy got married in Delhi.

891
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:03,353
What?

892
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:23,686
Bye.

893
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:45,936
I am still not aware
about your planning.

894
00:52:46,186 --> 00:52:46,978
Sorry.

895
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:49,311
You have sent Charki
and Fulki by train.

896
00:52:49,395 --> 00:52:52,478
We guys have got seat here
and our son and daughter got there.

897
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:54,853
You don't think that the
whole family should be altogether.

898
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:57,228
You have been really
an old person now.

899
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,395
Who says?

900
00:52:58,478 --> 00:52:59,520
I am saying.

901
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,270
When we were a new married couple...

902
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:05,520
...remember that time.
What did you say?

903
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,270
What?

904
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:10,728
You used to say lets
go somewhere alone.

905
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:13,895
Sit alone, have food alone.

906
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,645
That I want to say right now also.

907
00:53:20,728 --> 00:53:22,686
See our son is newly married now.

908
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,603
Won't they sit separately now?

909
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,770
Let them enjoy.

910
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:28,770
Disgusting.

911
00:53:33,728 --> 00:53:34,853
Hey why are you crying?

912
00:53:34,936 --> 00:53:35,895
Don't talk to me.

913
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,395
You have spoiled my life.

914
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:39,311
Do I have spoiled your life?

915
00:53:39,395 --> 00:53:40,478
Your life was gonna spoil...

916
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:42,436
You know after marring you
I have saved your life.

917
00:53:42,603 --> 00:53:43,728
Saved my foot.

918
00:53:44,228 --> 00:53:46,103
You have spoiled all of my plans.

919
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:48,103
Plan?

920
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:49,145
Yes plan.

921
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,895
Bijoy loves Julie and I love Shaan.

922
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:55,520
But I could not say my father.

923
00:53:55,895 --> 00:53:57,686
According to plan Bijoy was
supposed to be absent during wedding.

924
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,645
And at the last minute of wedding.

925
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:02,186
Shaan would come
and propose to marry me.

926
00:54:02,395 --> 00:54:05,145
Oh my God. What a plan you guys had.

927
00:54:05,353 --> 00:54:06,353
Hey after that?

928
00:54:06,936 --> 00:54:07,770
After that?

929
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:09,186
You are the main villain.

930
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,728
You just came to marry in nice mood.

931
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:13,103
Hey listen.
I will never be your wife okay?

932
00:54:13,395 --> 00:54:15,520
You listen,
I also will not be your husband too.

933
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:16,811
Since my childhood...

934
00:54:16,895 --> 00:54:19,853
I have given my body, mind, thinking
and all of my belongings to Priyanka.

935
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,311
As you love Shaan,
I also love Priyanka.

936
00:54:22,853 --> 00:54:25,061
Then why didn't you tell
your father about Priyanka.

937
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:27,645
Just like you as you could
not be able to inform your father.

938
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,811
My knees become out of my control
before my father.

939
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,520
I also could not able to inform
afraid of his heart attacks.

940
00:54:35,728 --> 00:54:37,311
Then why are blaming me only?

941
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:38,603
Here you are also culprit.

942
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:41,645
Already I am half dead in tension.

943
00:54:42,853 --> 00:54:44,811
Now If Priyanka comes
to know about this wedding...

944
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:48,978
Palkiwala's son has
escaped with my sister...

945
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:51,145
And they have done registry also.

946
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:54,853
And you guys are like watching movies.
Is that in my face?

947
00:54:54,936 --> 00:54:56,811
Don't make me angry.

948
00:54:57,645 --> 00:55:00,020
My name is Patla Poda.

949
00:55:00,353 --> 00:55:03,186
Bring them here wherever
you get them from.

950
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,478
But boss. News is not confirmed.

951
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:07,228
I have come to know from somewhere.

952
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:10,478
So that I can also shoot you here.

953
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,395
If anything goes wrong with Julie.

954
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:16,103
So I will kill you all here.

955
00:55:16,978 --> 00:55:19,061
Find out everywhere.

956
00:55:19,853 --> 00:55:23,186
Try to know where they are.

957
00:55:25,645 --> 00:55:27,186
Hey sir.

958
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,853
Hey Giridhari... how are you?

959
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:30,103
Fine.

960
00:55:30,478 --> 00:55:32,686
Sir.. sir.

961
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:35,853
He has come with his wife.

962
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:47,353
What do you want? What you watch?

963
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:49,978
Father it's not watch...
It's what do you want.

964
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:51,395
Don't stitching me.

965
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:53,145
Father it's not stitching...
It's teach.

966
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,020
I know I know...
Don't try to teach me English.

967
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,853
That was slipped out by mistake.

968
00:55:58,103 --> 00:55:59,020
Who is she?

969
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:01,020
But you know her. She is Julie.

970
00:56:01,478 --> 00:56:03,561
I love her that's why
I have married her directly.

971
00:56:03,645 --> 00:56:05,936
But I am not gonna accept
this indirect marriage.

972
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,186
She is a Christian girl.

973
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:09,228
Her elder brother is a mafia.
He is a murderer too.

974
00:56:09,311 --> 00:56:11,645
Mother, Julie is a nice girl.

975
00:56:11,895 --> 00:56:13,103
You both can adjust with each other.

976
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:14,895
I have been leaked because of you.

977
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:16,811
I have lost my prestige
before Raghab Roy.

978
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,853
Why?

979
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:21,020
Father as I love Julie,
Tina also loves Shaan.

980
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,270
You people got it wrong.

981
00:56:23,353 --> 00:56:26,228
Since I planned this one. Tina also could
be able to marry could marry Shaan.

982
00:56:26,436 --> 00:56:27,895
And I have married Julie directly.

983
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:29,186
Who is Shaan?

984
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:31,728
Tina has not married Shaan,
she has married Joy.

985
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,270
- Joy?
- Rajballabh has saved my prestige.

986
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,103
That's why wedding was done
in between Tina and Joy.

987
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,061
Oh my God! That means
everything is messed up here.

988
00:56:40,853 --> 00:56:42,645
Joy has suddenly changed his mind.

989
00:56:43,561 --> 00:56:46,478
Anyway, Julie you take
blessings from my parents.

990
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,978
Stay away.

991
00:56:48,436 --> 00:56:49,895
Get in.

992
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:53,853
Get out! Out.. out.

993
00:56:54,353 --> 00:56:56,728
The terrace of this house
is also not open for you.

994
00:56:57,603 --> 00:56:58,353
But father how could you?

995
00:56:58,436 --> 00:57:01,395
Today onwards I am not
gonna grant you as my son.

996
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:06,020
Don't late. Just pop out. Pop out.

997
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:09,478
So heard everything.

998
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:13,145
You went to create an incident
and made an accident.

999
00:57:14,895 --> 00:57:16,895
For last two hours
you have been sitting here.

1000
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:20,020
Do you want to wait
any more or want to leave?

1001
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,520
I will wait for her whole life father.

1002
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,603
Why are you calling me father again?

1003
00:57:24,978 --> 00:57:26,686
I am your unofficial father.

1004
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:29,686
Since your childhood you have
done everything with my daughter.

1005
00:57:29,895 --> 00:57:31,936
And married Raghab Roy's daughter.

1006
00:57:32,645 --> 00:57:33,811
I never wanted to do this.

1007
00:57:33,895 --> 00:57:35,478
My Hitler father did it forcefully.

1008
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:37,978
No one can force a
person against his will.

1009
00:57:38,603 --> 00:57:43,311
Actually the thing is if I could share
each and everything with Priyanka...

1010
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:44,561
...I could have felt relaxed.

1011
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:48,186
You just forget Priyanka
and enjoy your happy married life.

1012
00:57:48,853 --> 00:57:51,020
Ok. What's the name of wife.

1013
00:57:52,478 --> 00:57:53,561
I guess Tina.

1014
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,728
Father you still have
not driven out this guy.

1015
00:57:57,228 --> 00:57:59,478
Get up, get out, get out I say.

1016
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:00,895
- Priyanka please listen.
- Shut up.

1017
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:01,936
What Priyanka?

1018
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,103
Priyanka please listen to me at least.

1019
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:04,103
What should I listen?

1020
00:58:04,186 --> 00:58:05,311
Tomorrow is your
2nd night of marriage.

1021
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:07,311
And you have come to explain.

1022
00:58:07,395 --> 00:58:09,103
Just get out.
Otherwise I will call the police.

1023
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:09,686
Hey no, no.

1024
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:11,186
I can go to the senior authorities also.

1025
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,020
- Get out, get out. Get out from here.
- Priya.

1026
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:14,395
- Piku. Piku.
- Get out.

1027
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:20,978
It's very much painful.

1028
00:58:21,228 --> 00:58:22,770
Jokes apart I am blind also.

1029
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:27,061
I think that idiot Sumanta
is the only left choice.

1030
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,561
Tomorrow is Joy's 2nd night
of marriage.

1031
00:58:30,436 --> 00:58:32,978
The end will come after that.

1032
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:51,353
Hey you. Are you inside this room?

1033
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:56,978
If you are here, please come out.

1034
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,353
Hey! Why are you hiding
yourself here behind the bed?

1035
00:59:05,603 --> 00:59:08,520
Hey be careful you will be murdered
if you come forward.

1036
00:59:08,686 --> 00:59:09,645
Don't forget I am his fiancée.

1037
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:11,311
Hey listen.
I am also someone's fiancée okay?

1038
00:59:11,395 --> 00:59:12,520
May be you are my wife.

1039
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:14,561
But don't have any interest
to sleep on this bed with you.

1040
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,728
You don't need to worry.

1041
00:59:17,395 --> 00:59:18,686
Please don't get excited.

1042
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:19,853
Don't try to act over-smart.

1043
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:21,645
If you really do this, trust
will I will kill you with this knife.

1044
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:25,020
Hey you can't kill
me with this butter-knife.

1045
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,520
Take it. It's a fruit cutter knife.

1046
00:59:27,603 --> 00:59:29,520
You can kill me easily with this one.

1047
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:31,603
Hey take it.

1048
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:34,936
Hey.. hey... Still you don't trust me?

1049
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,061
Listen we both have
to check out a plan.

1050
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:42,936
I promise to positively
give you a divorce.

1051
00:59:43,186 --> 00:59:44,728
Yes. I am a divorce specialist.

1052
00:59:44,936 --> 00:59:46,103
I was never defeated.

1053
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:47,436
So don't get pressure.

1054
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,520
- So come. Let's sleep.
- No, no.

1055
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:52,061
You cannot sleep on this bed.

1056
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:53,645
Then where will I sleep?

1057
00:59:54,686 --> 00:59:56,478
Sofa. Sleep on this sofa.

1058
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,228
Take it.

1059
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:11,561
- May I switch off the light?
- No.

1060
01:00:21,436 --> 01:00:23,351
Come daughter in law. Sit here.

1061
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:27,936
My Joy is a very good son.

1062
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,395
He will impress you very soon.

1063
01:00:31,478 --> 01:00:32,686
Look daughter in law.

1064
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:36,395
I am retired chief justice
Rajballabh Chowdhury.

1065
01:00:36,686 --> 01:00:40,145
Under my rules no one
could try to do anything.

1066
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,103
My only son's wedding
would be done in this way.

1067
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:46,311
I never expected that.

1068
01:00:46,603 --> 01:00:50,061
That's why I will arrange
a big get together party.

1069
01:00:50,395 --> 01:00:54,895
Where the prestigious personalities
will come from different corners of India.

1070
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:57,353
I will introduce you guys
with them also.

1071
01:00:57,645 --> 01:00:59,936
You guys are an ideal couple.

1072
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,978
Hey! Am I right?

1073
01:01:17,145 --> 01:01:21,895
Hello Tina,
this is Shaan, it is Shaan.

1074
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:23,145
Are you drinking?

1075
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:26,311
I am drinking.

1076
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,520
Last night you enjoy with your honey.

1077
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,020
Then what will I do on behalf of that?

1078
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,978
That's why I am drinking.

1079
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:40,061
So madam.
How was your night yesterday?

1080
01:01:40,686 --> 01:01:43,103
Shaan. He has not touched me yet.

1081
01:01:43,186 --> 01:01:46,770
Oh God! What a holy lady!

1082
01:01:46,978 --> 01:01:48,728
- He has not touched yet.
- Shut up.

1083
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,978
Trust me. This guy is genuinely good.

1084
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:56,436
Oh really! You have come to
know to that he is good in one night.

1085
01:01:57,603 --> 01:02:02,353
So what did he do with you
that I could not?

1086
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,811
Don't make me fool.

1087
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:06,603
Shaan. You know the situation how was.

1088
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:08,061
He has married in fear of his father...

1089
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:09,645
...and I was afraid of
my father's heart attack.

1090
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:15,853
One who gets one heart attack in a week,
he should pass away definitely.

1091
01:02:16,395 --> 01:02:19,353
At least problems could
be solved after his death.

1092
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:20,853
What rubbish you are saying Shaan?

1093
01:02:22,978 --> 01:02:24,103
Someone is knocking.

1094
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:25,770
No one.

1095
01:02:26,228 --> 01:02:29,478
See your loving genuinely
good Joy has come.

1096
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,728
May be he wants to
taste his honey gain.

1097
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:33,603
Can you please stop it?

1098
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:35,228
Bye for now okay?

1099
01:02:35,895 --> 01:02:37,561
Hello.. hello.

1100
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,728
Oh God. Hanged the phone.

1101
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:50,770
What are you doing with Chouki here?

1102
01:02:50,853 --> 01:02:52,436
Where is Chouki? Here it is a bed.

1103
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,395
My name is Chouki madam.
Good name is Chandan.

1104
01:02:56,603 --> 01:03:00,603
I was born under a chouki that's why
my mother has given me that name Chouki.

1105
01:03:01,061 --> 01:03:03,234
I have not heard anything madam.
I am going.

1106
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:09,353
What's now? Your father
is calling a lot of people.

1107
01:03:09,603 --> 01:03:10,978
That I really cannot tolerate.

1108
01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:12,186
I'm gonna have phenol now.

1109
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,311
No.. no.. no one dies out of phenol,
dies but half.

1110
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,645
Acid is better than phenol.
So have acid please.

1111
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:19,936
What? You are suggesting me
to have acid?

1112
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,353
I have not said that.
Please keep quite.

1113
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,728
- Hello.
- Hey Bijoy speaking.

1114
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,520
No, no that's my new number.

1115
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:34,811
Julie's elder brother is
looking for us like a crazy dog.

1116
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:36,686
That's why I have
taken a new sim card.

1117
01:03:37,895 --> 01:03:40,353
Hey I have come to know
from my father that...

1118
01:03:41,145 --> 01:03:43,686
...you have married Tina directly.

1119
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:46,686
I never wanted to do this bro.
It was done to us forcefully.

1120
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:48,853
To save the prestige
of your napoleon father.

1121
01:03:48,936 --> 01:03:50,645
My Hitler father just has killed me.

1122
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:54,436
Bijoy! Where are you?
I tried your number a lot.

1123
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,103
Tina! Are you okay?

1124
01:03:56,186 --> 01:03:56,978
What okay?

1125
01:03:57,061 --> 01:03:59,645
Just because of your unconfident
friend everything has been spoiled.

1126
01:03:59,728 --> 01:04:01,353
What was your Shaan doing then?

1127
01:04:01,645 --> 01:04:03,353
He is just a nothing but useless.

1128
01:04:03,603 --> 01:04:05,228
Don't use slang against Shaan.

1129
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:07,145
All discredits go to this Joy.

1130
01:04:07,353 --> 01:04:09,895
Ok listen. His father is gonna
arrange a get together party.

1131
01:04:10,103 --> 01:04:13,103
If it really happens,
we will be finished permanently.

1132
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:15,228
Pass the phone to Joy please.

1133
01:04:18,353 --> 01:04:21,145
Look bro. Please do something.
Do whatever.

1134
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:24,686
Listen Julie and me are going to Bangkok
to save ourselves from her elder brother.

1135
01:04:25,103 --> 01:04:27,686
You guys also come to Bangkok
giving excuses of honeymoon.

1136
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,103
Bring Priyanka also.

1137
01:04:29,686 --> 01:04:30,978
Shaan. Shaan also.

1138
01:04:31,061 --> 01:04:32,645
Oh yes tell her to call Shaan also.

1139
01:04:32,853 --> 01:04:33,728
Understood?

1140
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:34,811
It's okay.

1141
01:04:34,895 --> 01:04:35,936
What happened?

1142
01:04:36,145 --> 01:04:37,936
We have to leave for Bangkok,
for honeymoon.

1143
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:38,770
What?

1144
01:04:38,853 --> 01:04:40,061
Oh it's not like that honeymoon.

1145
01:04:40,145 --> 01:04:41,770
Listen. Bijoy has planned something.

1146
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,728
You just call Shaan in Kolkata
as soon as possible.

1147
01:04:44,186 --> 01:04:45,895
He will stay at one
of my friend's house.

1148
01:04:46,061 --> 01:04:47,853
We will take Shaan with us also.

1149
01:04:48,145 --> 01:04:50,061
But before that we have
to manage Priyanka also.

1150
01:04:50,145 --> 01:04:51,145
We will bring her also.

1151
01:04:51,228 --> 01:04:52,686
Why? Why will I go to Bangkok?

1152
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,520
I am making it clear.

1153
01:04:53,603 --> 01:04:54,936
Don't touch me.

1154
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,895
Priya please listen to me at least.

1155
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:59,645
You have married this girl.
Now you are calling me Priya.

1156
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:01,353
Priya trust me. I love you only.

1157
01:05:01,436 --> 01:05:04,061
Shame on you. You are talking
like this in front of your new wife.

1158
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:06,561
A lot of days you entertained me.

1159
01:05:06,728 --> 01:05:08,436
You also told me to wait here.

1160
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,811
Then how could you
marry this girl suddenly?

1161
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,103
Cheater.

1162
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,895
One minute Priyanka.

1163
01:05:14,353 --> 01:05:17,645
You don't know me.
You are taking wrong.

1164
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:20,395
I am not Joy Chowdhury's wife.

1165
01:05:20,478 --> 01:05:24,145
Oh God! Wearing all the
symptoms like a married woman...

1166
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,145
You are saying that you
are not Joy Chowdhury's wife.

1167
01:05:26,353 --> 01:05:27,186
Who are you?

1168
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,478
How are you related to Joy?

1169
01:05:28,645 --> 01:05:31,728
Listen this guys is nothing
but just a puppet of his father.

1170
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:35,478
He has already spoiled my life,
now it's your turn.

1171
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,436
Priyanka give me at least five minutes.

1172
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,936
I am explaining the
full story before you.

1173
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,353
- Please listen.
- Please listen.

1174
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,186
Tell me what's the story is.

1175
01:05:43,978 --> 01:05:45,895
Actually I love Shaan.

1176
01:05:46,145 --> 01:05:48,978
But in a great danger
I had to marry him.

1177
01:05:57,978 --> 01:06:01,645
Hey Vishnupriya, I can smell you.

1178
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:04,311
Do you have come? Where?

1179
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:07,061
But you guys have slept together too.

1180
01:06:07,145 --> 01:06:09,270
Forget about sleeping,
flower has not bloomed yet.

1181
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:12,603
I am telling you. I love Shaan only.
He is my everything.

1182
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:15,103
Listen Priya.
My father has arranged a get together.

1183
01:06:15,186 --> 01:06:16,436
Before that we need
to leave for a honeymoon.

1184
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,395
Honeymoon?

1185
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:18,561
You just have said
that you are not couple.

1186
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,728
Then why is this honeymoon?

1187
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:21,270
Oh it's not like
that kind of honeymoon.

1188
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:22,520
Then what kind of honeymoon it is?

1189
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,770
His father is gonna arrange
a get together party.

1190
01:06:25,103 --> 01:06:27,728
If it becomes true,
we won't have any other option.

1191
01:06:27,978 --> 01:06:30,811
I have infirmed Bijoy already.
He will inform Shaan.

1192
01:06:30,895 --> 01:06:32,561
We all go together.

1193
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:38,770
That's my Vishnupriya.
Vishnupriya has come back to me.

1194
01:06:38,853 --> 01:06:39,686
Leave her.

1195
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,561
Hey your mother has come back.

1196
01:06:41,645 --> 01:06:44,770
It's my Vishnupriya.

1197
01:06:44,978 --> 01:06:45,728
Leave her.

1198
01:06:45,811 --> 01:06:47,770
Please give me a hug.

1199
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:49,978
Your mom has returned.

1200
01:06:50,061 --> 01:06:51,311
This is my Vishnupriya.

1201
01:06:51,395 --> 01:06:53,103
She is mine.
She is my Vishnupriya.

1202
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:54,270
- She is not your Vishnupriya.
- Come to me Vishnupriya.

1203
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:56,145
Vishnu you are mine.

1204
01:06:56,228 --> 01:06:57,561
Please don't leave me.

1205
01:06:57,978 --> 01:06:59,395
Vishnu don't do this please.

1206
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:01,811
No dad, she's not my mom.

1207
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,395
Please don't take me away.

1208
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,186
- You don't know.
- You please come with me.

1209
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:07,478
Please don't leave me.

1210
01:07:08,645 --> 01:07:11,686
Open the door Priyanka.

1211
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:15,311
Open the door Priyanka.

1212
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:17,520
It's me.

1213
01:07:17,603 --> 01:07:18,520
Sorry.

1214
01:07:18,603 --> 01:07:19,603
I hope he will not come again.

1215
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:20,978
No.

1216
01:07:21,061 --> 01:07:22,270
Ok now we are going okay?

1217
01:07:22,353 --> 01:07:23,978
- Bye.
- Bye.

1218
01:07:24,436 --> 01:07:25,603
Mind it. Monday Bangkok.

1219
01:07:25,895 --> 01:07:29,311
What? Bangkok? Honeymoon?

1220
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,686
I am retired chief justice
Rajballabh Chowdhury.

1221
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:34,311
They are denying my words.

1222
01:07:34,478 --> 01:07:37,436
Please calm down.
Your dhoti is like... coming out.

1223
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,395
Let remove everything.

1224
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:41,978
My get together party is almost ready.

1225
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:47,561
Bloody guy, always afraid of me,
stammers before me.

1226
01:07:47,645 --> 01:07:50,395
Now he is going to Bangkok.

1227
01:07:50,478 --> 01:07:52,436
Okay your party is not going anywhere.

1228
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,853
You can rearrange the party
after they come from honeymoon.

1229
01:07:54,936 --> 01:07:59,770
No never. First party then honeymoon.

1230
01:07:59,936 --> 01:08:00,811
Hey listen.

1231
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:03,145
- Listen very carefully what I am saying.
- Tell me.

1232
01:08:03,228 --> 01:08:05,228
You know how you had
fixed that wedding suddenly.

1233
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:08,811
You just have put two
unknown persons into a cage.

1234
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,728
In this situation both of them
will not be happy during this party.

1235
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,436
Do you think will your party
will be high then.

1236
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:18,770
Let them go for honeymoon
and come back too.

1237
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:22,603
Then you will see how much
successful your party will be.

1238
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:25,686
Not a bad idea.

1239
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,311
Give me that one.

1240
01:08:29,228 --> 01:08:31,561
First honeymoon then party.

1241
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:35,686
Otherwise Joy will
not enjoy the party.

1242
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:38,770
Instead of that he
will behave like Debdas.

1243
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:41,270
I am sitting here like Debdas.

1244
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:46,520
When my Paro will come to me?

1245
01:08:57,311 --> 01:08:58,436
Shaan!

1246
01:08:59,311 --> 01:09:00,186
Who?

1247
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,311
What are doing here?

1248
01:09:02,103 --> 01:09:09,061
Hey Mrs. Joy Chowdhury.

1249
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:16,103
Look at me...
look at me very carefully.

1250
01:09:17,895 --> 01:09:22,728
Paro... I have not
gone to any Chandramukhi.

1251
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,645
I am in you,
was in you, will be in you.

1252
01:09:28,728 --> 01:09:30,353
What rubbish you are talking. Shut up.

1253
01:09:31,436 --> 01:09:33,228
I have already shut up.

1254
01:09:34,145 --> 01:09:38,353
Whom I decided to marry...she is...

1255
01:09:39,853 --> 01:09:48,436
Hey Mr. Chowdhury.
Come, come. Sit Down.

1256
01:09:48,645 --> 01:09:51,145
Now I am gonna cry.

1257
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,853
I am gonna cry.

1258
01:09:58,978 --> 01:10:01,103
Sit Down. Sit Down.

1259
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:09,811
Hey buddy.
What a service you are providing.

1260
01:10:12,478 --> 01:10:14,145
So how are feeling, hmm?

1261
01:10:15,895 --> 01:10:20,686
But Mr. Chowdhury the girl
you have married with...

1262
01:10:21,186 --> 01:10:24,186
...once upon a time
she was so closed to me.

1263
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,561
Shut up Shaan.

1264
01:10:26,603 --> 01:10:29,520
See, see Mr. Joy.

1265
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:32,520
Look at this modern days Paro.

1266
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:37,936
For Debdas no feelings, no regret...

1267
01:10:38,645 --> 01:10:41,561
...no love, no emotion,
no affection at all.

1268
01:10:41,936 --> 01:10:44,061
Everything is like...

1269
01:10:46,436 --> 01:10:47,770
Who is this woman?

1270
01:10:47,853 --> 01:10:50,686
I am Priyanka.
We are supposed to get married.

1271
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:55,936
That day I also supposed to
get married with Tina, but failed.

1272
01:10:56,311 --> 01:10:58,478
Look, Mr. Shaan.
Please don't break down.

1273
01:11:00,436 --> 01:11:02,853
I have not broken down at all Mr. Joy.

1274
01:11:03,311 --> 01:11:06,020
Just have cracked a little bit.

1275
01:11:07,103 --> 01:11:09,686
Look, I am an advocate.
Divorce Specialist.

1276
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:16,478
You can get Tina just after my divorce
with Tina, and I will marry Priyanka.

1277
01:11:21,895 --> 01:11:24,020
What a piece you are.

1278
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:27,686
Oh god! Two girls together.

1279
01:11:32,436 --> 01:11:35,020
I am asking how was your last night?

1280
01:11:35,103 --> 01:11:39,478
No.. no.. no.. god promise, trust me.
Nothing happened between us.

1281
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:40,728
Really?

1282
01:11:40,811 --> 01:11:42,895
Yes, he is saying the truth actually.

1283
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:45,228
Listen, Bijoy has a plan.

1284
01:11:45,645 --> 01:11:47,395
We altogether will go to Bangkok.

1285
01:11:47,561 --> 01:11:48,561
- Bangkok?
- Yes.

1286
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,770
My Hitler father also
have given the permission.

1287
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:52,270
For the honeymoon.

1288
01:11:52,353 --> 01:11:53,270
Honeymoon?

1289
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:57,520
After going there everybody
will enter in your rooms...

1290
01:11:57,603 --> 01:12:00,020
...and shut your doors from inside.

1291
01:12:00,103 --> 01:12:03,186
- So will I fly kites sitting in my room?
- Shaan can you please stop it?

1292
01:12:04,103 --> 01:12:05,603
You will stay in my room with me.

1293
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:06,728
What?

1294
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:14,561
What are you saying?
Really? When would we go?

1295
01:12:15,186 --> 01:12:18,520
I can't stand these kind of
silly things at all.

1296
01:12:19,311 --> 01:12:21,770
I have around three
to four cars in my house.

1297
01:12:22,145 --> 01:12:26,811
And chief justice Rajballabh's son
is going to airport by taxi.

1298
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,061
I can't take it.

1299
01:12:28,145 --> 01:12:31,145
What are you saying?
It's a minor matter.

1300
01:12:31,311 --> 01:12:33,603
Should you be angry at this good time?

1301
01:12:33,936 --> 01:12:36,311
- Better you give them your blessings.
- Yes.

1302
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,811
Hey you Idiot. Come here.

1303
01:12:40,478 --> 01:12:41,728
It's okay.

1304
01:12:41,811 --> 01:12:43,395
It's okay daughter.

1305
01:12:44,853 --> 01:12:46,686
- Okay fine.
- Father.

1306
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:53,978
Listen. Honeymoon mean
knowing better each other.

1307
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:56,395
You are a divorce specialist.

1308
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:59,811
Mind it, don't think about that.

1309
01:12:59,895 --> 01:13:02,020
You guys are young now.

1310
01:13:02,103 --> 01:13:05,020
This is the age for enjoying
with each other. Be happy.

1311
01:13:05,103 --> 01:13:10,811
Be alert. Don't rush to nursing home
after coming back. Mind it. Let's go.

1312
01:13:10,895 --> 01:13:11,478
Good bye Mom.

1313
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:12,436
We are going.

1314
01:13:13,061 --> 01:13:14,645
- Good bye Dad.
- Be careful.

1315
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:17,186
God always keep your blessing.

1316
01:13:17,395 --> 01:13:18,936
Give a call after you reach.

1317
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,020
Okay.

1318
01:13:34,228 --> 01:13:35,770
Hey Chouki.

1319
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,145
Hey. Suddenly you are here?

1320
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:39,686
What happened?

1321
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,436
- What supposed to be happened.
- What happened?

1322
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,978
That is, Joy sir and madam
has left for their honeymoon.

1323
01:13:44,145 --> 01:13:45,311
Bangkok.

1324
01:13:45,645 --> 01:13:49,353
Honeymoon? Bangkok?
Means.. after reaching Bangkok.

1325
01:13:49,728 --> 01:13:52,728
Then I must inform it to Priyanka.

1326
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,728
- Hi.
- Hi.

1327
01:14:02,936 --> 01:14:04,353
- Hi.
- Hi.

1328
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:05,895
What's up?

1329
01:14:05,978 --> 01:14:06,853
- Good.
- Where is Shaan?

1330
01:14:06,936 --> 01:14:08,478
- He will reach directly.
- Great.

1331
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:12,103
Let's go.

1332
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:13,811
And you guys sit in the backseat.
I will seat at front seat.

1333
01:14:15,811 --> 01:14:17,103
Do you have believed now?

1334
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,395
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1335
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:23,020
- What happened?
- At least one please.

1336
01:14:24,728 --> 01:14:26,061
Please once.

1337
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:34,936
Hey what are looking at?

1338
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:40,395
No madam, actually your geography, and
their history is so much confusing.

1339
01:14:40,478 --> 01:14:42,395
Don't try to understand anything.
Please go.

1340
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,228
It's ok.

1341
01:14:46,561 --> 01:14:50,228
That is it. Who is whose lover.

1342
01:14:50,436 --> 01:14:52,436
I will disclose each and everything.

1343
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,561
Then you will understand
what could be the main trouble.

1344
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:10,353
Let's go to Bangkok.

1345
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:56,368
Give it to me.

1346
01:15:58,836 --> 01:15:59,920
See they've come.

1347
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:01,586
- Hi.
- Hi.

1348
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:02,211
- Hi.
- Hi.

1349
01:16:02,295 --> 01:16:03,295
- How're you?
- Hi.

1350
01:16:03,547 --> 01:16:05,003
- Hello
- Shaan Hi!

1351
01:16:05,086 --> 01:16:06,086
Fine, Bijoy, this is Priyanka.

1352
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:06,836
- Hello.
- Hi.

1353
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,336
- How was the journey?
- First class.

1354
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:10,003
We've come here,
now what are gonna do?

1355
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:13,836
Now tomorrow we'll go to
the court to file the divorce.

1356
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,628
Hey listen, that is not here,
that would be in India.

1357
01:16:16,836 --> 01:16:19,128
Oh My God! Then what are we here for?

1358
01:16:19,586 --> 01:16:20,461
Let's go back to India.

1359
01:16:20,545 --> 01:16:22,628
- Listen.
- One minute?

1360
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:24,003
You've again boozed?

1361
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:28,795
Actually darling,
yesterday my beloved Chandramukhi...

1362
01:16:29,045 --> 01:16:31,461
...had given a treat to her Debdas.

1363
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:32,545
Idiot.

1364
01:16:32,795 --> 01:16:34,711
Okay fine, let's go. Let's freshen up.

1365
01:16:34,795 --> 01:16:36,170
Yeah let's go, let's go.

1366
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,795
She is not going to understand.

1367
01:16:38,878 --> 01:16:39,753
Ok bro, fine.

1368
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:44,836
Oh My God! There's a group of hunks.

1369
01:16:45,211 --> 01:16:47,878
From my country, my people.

1370
01:16:47,961 --> 01:16:50,253
All are hunks!

1371
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:53,961
Mr. Sakha, two more friends of mine
and their wives have turned up...

1372
01:16:54,045 --> 01:16:55,086
...need two more rooms.

1373
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:57,753
Oh! You'll get it for sure.
Is it Honeymoon?

1374
01:16:57,836 --> 01:16:59,128
Yes, Miss Sakhi! Honeymoon!

1375
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:02,170
Oh! Mischievous guy,
It's not Sakhi, it's Sakha.

1376
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,253
Tell me, who's going to
perform Honeymoon with whom?

1377
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:07,295
Should that be informed to you,
Mr. Sakha?

1378
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:09,628
OMG! This is the ritual...

1379
01:17:09,711 --> 01:17:14,045
...the one who are married, only they
are allowed to do honeymoon. Isn't it?

1380
01:17:14,128 --> 01:17:17,170
Now tell me who has married whom?

1381
01:17:17,253 --> 01:17:19,545
Here, Joy is directly married to Tina.

1382
01:17:19,628 --> 01:17:20,920
- And...
- Oh, Got It.

1383
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,253
Mr. Joy and Tina in one room.

1384
01:17:23,336 --> 01:17:26,170
And he and she would
be in another room.

1385
01:17:26,253 --> 01:17:29,045
No. I will stay with Tina.

1386
01:17:29,128 --> 01:17:29,545
Yes.

1387
01:17:29,628 --> 01:17:31,128
And Joy will stay with me.

1388
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:32,461
Why aren't you saying anything?

1389
01:17:33,253 --> 01:17:35,920
Oh! Wish to have it from both ends?

1390
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:40,003
This is going to be a
mixture in terms of residing.

1391
01:17:40,711 --> 01:17:43,295
See, if there's so much confusion...

1392
01:17:43,503 --> 01:17:46,378
...then why not two boys
and two girls in two separate rooms?

1393
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:49,295
We'll see to it.
You just give us the keys.

1394
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:51,128
Just a minute.

1395
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:54,836
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

1396
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:56,795
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1397
01:17:59,795 --> 01:18:02,878
Oh God! These guys
are really handsome.

1398
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:07,628
It would have been easy for me, if
they stayed in separate rooms. Shit.

1399
01:18:07,836 --> 01:18:10,086
Priyanka is accompanying
Joy in his honeymoon?

1400
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,128
Yes.

1401
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:12,461
That's really weird.

1402
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:18,878
That means two heroines and one hero?

1403
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:21,461
And Mom, they were
hugging while travelling.

1404
01:18:21,545 --> 01:18:24,586
Shit. It seems that Tina is nobody.

1405
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,420
His everything is Priyanka.

1406
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,211
- Confusion.
- What?

1407
01:18:29,295 --> 01:18:30,295
Take the news.

1408
01:18:30,378 --> 01:18:32,003
How would I take it mom?

1409
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:35,503
You convert yourself
from a lawyer to a detective.

1410
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:36,170
Okay.

1411
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:41,753
Go straight away to Bangkok, and
find out what is their real intention.

1412
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:48,795
Really Piku, didn't expect
you to be so close to me.

1413
01:18:48,878 --> 01:18:52,253
That you would return again,
even after you're married.

1414
01:18:52,336 --> 01:18:53,753
I was heartbroken.

1415
01:18:53,836 --> 01:18:56,878
But I knew that I would get you back.

1416
01:18:56,961 --> 01:19:00,420
I got you back but
don't know for how long.

1417
01:19:01,378 --> 01:19:02,920
I am really terrified you know.

1418
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:04,628
There has to be some
blunders taking place.

1419
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:05,878
Don't worry.

1420
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:07,045
Of course need to worry.

1421
01:19:07,128 --> 01:19:11,670
The way Joy wanted to live with you;
I think you guys have already been in bed.

1422
01:19:11,878 --> 01:19:15,545
Believe me, I might be married,
but we were never together.

1423
01:19:15,628 --> 01:19:16,961
He's very gentle.

1424
01:19:17,045 --> 01:19:20,836
What? You're gentle?
Mischievous guy no. 1.

1425
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:22,961
You intended to have
fruits from both the trees.

1426
01:19:23,045 --> 01:19:25,295
Leave the fruits,
I didn't even have the grasses.

1427
01:19:25,586 --> 01:19:28,295
- Did you ever allow me to have grasses?
- Shut up!

1428
01:19:28,378 --> 01:19:29,545
And if you talk about Tina...

1429
01:19:29,628 --> 01:19:31,253
...didn't even get to hold her,
forget about having.

1430
01:19:31,336 --> 01:19:32,003
What do you mean?

1431
01:19:32,086 --> 01:19:34,753
I mean, I'm still a virgin.

1432
01:19:35,711 --> 01:19:36,795
I don't believe you.

1433
01:19:36,878 --> 01:19:38,086
- Believe me Piku!
- Get Off!

1434
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:40,961
O Piku, I swear, I'm still a virgin.

1435
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,545
Come closer to me, My honey!

1436
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:45,670
No. Still you're officially
a husband to some other person.

1437
01:19:46,128 --> 01:19:48,128
Hence, I'm not going to sleep
with you together in one bed.

1438
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:49,128
Why won't you sleep with me?

1439
01:19:49,295 --> 01:19:51,170
Joy has said that we will divorce you.

1440
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:52,795
And after that we are going to marry.

1441
01:19:52,878 --> 01:19:54,586
Then what is the problem
to sleep in one bed?

1442
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:55,753
There's a problem.

1443
01:19:55,836 --> 01:19:59,503
As long as we're not legally divorced,
I can't sleep with you in one bed.

1444
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:02,128
What? Then where will I sleep?

1445
01:20:02,295 --> 01:20:03,336
Under the bed.

1446
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:04,628
What?
Why under the bed?

1447
01:20:05,003 --> 01:20:08,586
We're officially husband wife.
Moreover, we have the license.

1448
01:20:08,836 --> 01:20:11,586
As long as you're parents
and my elder brother accept it...

1449
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,920
...I do not accept it officially.

1450
01:20:14,003 --> 01:20:18,878
This is not right Piku, okay not
in one bed, but please give me a kiss.

1451
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:22,086
No never. First with the kiss
and then slowly everything, isn't it?

1452
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:26,003
No dear. I don't want anything else,
just one...

1453
01:20:26,545 --> 01:20:28,920
I said no... no means no.

1454
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,211
Piku ummmuh!

1455
01:20:53,253 --> 01:20:56,753
"In the circus of mind,
in the bypass of life."

1456
01:20:56,961 --> 01:21:00,420
"No is there without you,
keep that in mind."

1457
01:21:07,878 --> 01:21:11,378
"Would become brave today,
would switch on the mind AC."

1458
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:15,170
"Hold me tight, and pull me off!"

1459
01:21:15,711 --> 01:21:19,795
"Hey, you're cheeks are so soft,
you're too shaky..."

1460
01:21:19,878 --> 01:21:22,878
"...would have the
bullet from your end."

1461
01:21:26,003 --> 01:21:31,086
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1462
01:21:33,295 --> 01:21:38,211
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1463
01:21:53,003 --> 01:21:56,586
"Darling, you've given the warning."

1464
01:21:56,670 --> 01:22:00,295
"Burning, the mind gets burnt."

1465
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,461
"Darling, you've given the warning."

1466
01:22:07,545 --> 01:22:11,128
"Burning, the mind gets burnt."

1467
01:22:11,211 --> 01:22:14,336
"Confusion, is in your mind."

1468
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:18,753
"Your attitude does
not seem positive."

1469
01:22:19,336 --> 01:22:23,378
"Hey, you're cheeks are so soft,
you're too shaky..."

1470
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:27,503
"...would have the
bullet from your end."

1471
01:22:29,586 --> 01:22:34,753
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1472
01:22:36,836 --> 01:22:42,003
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1473
01:23:03,753 --> 01:23:07,461
"You've filled up the empty mind."

1474
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:11,086
"See the siren is being heard."

1475
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:14,670
"My heart trembles too."

1476
01:23:14,753 --> 01:23:18,461
"Have seen there's no other way out."

1477
01:23:19,336 --> 01:23:23,420
"Hey, you're cheeks are so soft,
you're too shaky..."

1478
01:23:23,628 --> 01:23:27,420
"...would have the
bullet from your end."

1479
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:34,753
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1480
01:23:36,961 --> 01:23:42,003
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1481
01:23:44,211 --> 01:23:49,253
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1482
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:56,545
"Make everything abnormal,
Dhishkyaon, allow me to have."

1483
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:07,003
Oh My God, So handsome.

1484
01:24:07,253 --> 01:24:08,128
Good morning.

1485
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:09,753
Welcome.

1486
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:11,003
Thank you.

1487
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,336
I'm Sakha Mondal.

1488
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,128
Okay.

1489
01:24:14,211 --> 01:24:15,753
Say, I mean tell me.

1490
01:24:15,836 --> 01:24:19,086
Bengali? Great, A Bengali can help the
other Bengali in a foreign country.

1491
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:22,961
Only help? No, no,
if you say I'll do everything for you.

1492
01:24:23,045 --> 01:24:23,920
Can you give me a news?

1493
01:24:24,003 --> 01:24:26,045
Only news? And no room?

1494
01:24:26,128 --> 01:24:27,795
First give me the news,
then will take a room.

1495
01:24:27,878 --> 01:24:29,045
What news dear?

1496
01:24:29,128 --> 01:24:32,378
Has anybody named Joy,
Tina and Priyanka booked a room here?

1497
01:24:32,461 --> 01:24:34,170
This is not the way to get news.

1498
01:24:34,711 --> 01:24:38,961
To get the news, you need to stay,
need to see, taste...

1499
01:24:39,045 --> 01:24:41,003
...and that is how
you get the real thing.

1500
01:24:41,086 --> 01:24:43,503
Intelligent. Book a good room for me.

1501
01:24:43,586 --> 01:24:44,711
- Surely.
- Good.

1502
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,420
Fill this form up and sign here.

1503
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:51,586
Okay.

1504
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,295
I mean, are you alone?

1505
01:24:53,378 --> 01:24:55,753
Yes. Why?

1506
01:24:55,961 --> 01:24:58,586
No, that's gonna be fruitful then.

1507
01:24:59,086 --> 01:25:00,086
Here it is.

1508
01:25:05,878 --> 01:25:08,670
Flirty, naughty man,
rubbing my hand. Rubbish.

1509
01:25:08,753 --> 01:25:11,670
Mischievous, must have felt ashamed.

1510
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,628
Today I'm surely going
to take a night off. Oh My God.

1511
01:25:25,545 --> 01:25:29,420
My Darling, you are like my mother.

1512
01:25:31,295 --> 01:25:34,211
What would take money for? Huh!

1513
01:25:34,836 --> 01:25:37,003
Why? What happened darling?

1514
01:25:58,045 --> 01:26:01,836
Got a slap here too?
I'm born to get slaps.

1515
01:26:02,086 --> 01:26:03,253
Sir, Sir.

1516
01:26:03,336 --> 01:26:04,420
What's up Khosla?

1517
01:26:04,503 --> 01:26:05,878
It's indeed a hot case.

1518
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:09,003
Don't make me angry.
Tell me in details.

1519
01:26:09,086 --> 01:26:10,753
I'm here to tell you the fact.

1520
01:26:10,836 --> 01:26:12,545
Have heard that the son of
Palkiwala has taken your sister...

1521
01:26:12,628 --> 01:26:15,336
...to Bangkok for
the purpose of Honeymoon.

1522
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,461
What? Bangkok?

1523
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:22,920
Yes. It's sure shot news. There,
they have landed in playboy resort.

1524
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:25,170
- I'll go to Bangkok too.
- Sir.

1525
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:30,128
I'll break the bones
of that Palkiwala.

1526
01:26:30,336 --> 01:26:33,836
My name is Patla Poda.

1527
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,961
My name is Sakha Mondal.

1528
01:26:35,045 --> 01:26:37,045
Hey! Didn't ask for your name.

1529
01:26:37,503 --> 01:26:39,670
Tell me whether anybody
is here named Bijoy Palkiwala.

1530
01:26:39,753 --> 01:26:43,128
Oh My God! No news, without room.

1531
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:47,336
Okay, so first news, and then room.

1532
01:26:48,586 --> 01:26:52,045
Kindly fill this form up
and sign here.

1533
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:54,378
- Khosla.
- Boss.

1534
01:26:54,628 --> 01:26:56,128
He's asking me to do these shits.

1535
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,086
Oh my God!

1536
01:26:57,586 --> 01:26:58,420
Oh no!

1537
01:26:59,211 --> 01:27:00,586
See, this is signed
and have booked a room.

1538
01:27:03,503 --> 01:27:04,753
Here is the key.

1539
01:27:07,878 --> 01:27:12,253
Now, tell me whether anybody is here,
named Bijoy Palkiwala.

1540
01:27:13,836 --> 01:27:15,170
What happened?

1541
01:27:15,878 --> 01:27:18,170
Why do you want to
know the news of Palkiwala?

1542
01:27:19,045 --> 01:27:21,628
Because I wish to break
the bones of that Palkiwala.

1543
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,003
Sorry dear sorry, very, very sorry.

1544
01:27:26,086 --> 01:27:28,461
I cannot leak any such news to you.

1545
01:27:28,795 --> 01:27:31,670
- Oh it's hurting. Leave me.
- Quiet.

1546
01:27:32,045 --> 01:27:34,711
I'll take the news myself.
Where's the room?

1547
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:36,295
That side.

1548
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,420
Oh My god! What a giant!

1549
01:27:40,753 --> 01:27:43,378
I was sure to die now. Uff!

1550
01:27:43,753 --> 01:27:44,545
- Yes I know.
- Bijoy.

1551
01:27:44,628 --> 01:27:45,711
What happened Julie?

1552
01:27:45,795 --> 01:27:47,378
- We are finished.
- What?

1553
01:27:47,545 --> 01:27:48,420
Elder bro has turned up.

1554
01:27:48,503 --> 01:27:49,211
Whose brother?

1555
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:51,045
My brother...Patla da.

1556
01:27:51,128 --> 01:27:51,836
Patla da?

1557
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,253
I'll die now.

1558
01:27:53,586 --> 01:27:54,420
Sit down.

1559
01:27:54,503 --> 01:27:55,420
Just a minute.

1560
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:58,003
But how does he come
to know that we're here.

1561
01:27:58,086 --> 01:27:59,753
Moreover, what's wrong
if you elder bro has come.

1562
01:27:59,836 --> 01:28:01,045
You are already married.

1563
01:28:01,295 --> 01:28:03,170
I'm an advocate. So don't worry.

1564
01:28:03,253 --> 01:28:04,670
Hey Mr. Divorce specialist.

1565
01:28:04,753 --> 01:28:07,253
Would you get them divorced,
and send them up to Patla da?

1566
01:28:07,336 --> 01:28:08,628
First, get yourself divorced.

1567
01:28:08,711 --> 01:28:09,670
Would you shut up Shaan?

1568
01:28:09,753 --> 01:28:11,128
First, ask him to shut up.

1569
01:28:11,503 --> 01:28:12,961
He's saying, I'm there.

1570
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:15,461
Do you know Patla Poda?
A big gangster.

1571
01:28:15,753 --> 01:28:19,170
Murdering is like a game for him.
He can simply wipe you out.

1572
01:28:19,253 --> 01:28:20,878
Hey, hide under the table. Fast.

1573
01:28:24,128 --> 01:28:26,461
What happened? Is it Patla da?

1574
01:28:26,753 --> 01:28:28,336
No, donkey.

1575
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,711
Why would donkey
come to this restaurant?

1576
01:28:30,795 --> 01:28:31,836
Sumanta donkey.

1577
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:34,378
Who's Sumanta?

1578
01:28:34,628 --> 01:28:36,128
How did he come here?

1579
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:41,295
See let's skip this place,
or else we'll be finished.

1580
01:28:41,378 --> 01:28:42,503
Let's skip fast.

1581
01:28:42,586 --> 01:28:43,836
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

1582
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,586
Yeah, you leave first.

1583
01:29:06,378 --> 01:29:08,003
I only saw three.

1584
01:29:08,503 --> 01:29:09,795
Now here, there are six.

1585
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:13,545
That means, there's some blunder.
Need to find out.

1586
01:29:14,003 --> 01:29:15,128
Who's staying with whom?

1587
01:29:16,045 --> 01:29:18,336
Got to find out the son of Palkiwala.

1588
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,045
- He can't run away from me.
- Okay Boss.

1589
01:29:21,128 --> 01:29:23,336
My name is Patla.. Poda.

1590
01:29:25,503 --> 01:29:29,003
Huh! Rubbish!
Wearing shorts and taking bath.

1591
01:29:29,878 --> 01:29:34,253
Ah, let's peep here.
No, nothing is here.

1592
01:29:34,461 --> 01:29:36,420
Here the kids are playing.

1593
01:29:36,503 --> 01:29:38,003
What are you seeing there?

1594
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,003
Yes boss.

1595
01:29:39,253 --> 01:29:43,461
Here I'm in tension.
Let's peep into that room.

1596
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:48,420
Huh! Drinking and partying.

1597
01:29:50,295 --> 01:29:52,461
Huh! Watching TV here!

1598
01:29:52,711 --> 01:29:53,711
This room...

1599
01:29:58,836 --> 01:30:00,086
Boss. What're you seeing boss?

1600
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:01,878
Wait, wait let me see.

1601
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,003
What're you seeing boss?

1602
01:30:05,128 --> 01:30:06,128
Someone's there.

1603
01:30:09,878 --> 01:30:14,378
Khosla! Here everything is in open.

1604
01:30:14,711 --> 01:30:18,878
This is what honeymoon is.
Everything in open.

1605
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:24,128
Boss, that son of Palkiwala,
has brought our sister...

1606
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:25,628
...for this kind of honeymoon.

1607
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:30,378
That means Bijoy and my Julie...

1608
01:30:31,545 --> 01:30:34,753
Don't make me angry Khosla.

1609
01:30:35,753 --> 01:30:39,045
I need to find out that Bijoy.

1610
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:42,420
My name is Patla Poda.

1611
01:30:59,003 --> 01:31:01,711
"Oh dear miss you, miss you."

1612
01:31:01,795 --> 01:31:03,545
"Miss you, miss you."

1613
01:31:03,628 --> 01:31:05,711
"Wish to have you closer."

1614
01:31:05,795 --> 01:31:08,128
"Wish to have you closer."

1615
01:31:09,711 --> 01:31:12,211
"Oh dear miss you, miss you."

1616
01:31:12,295 --> 01:31:13,920
"Wish to have you closer."

1617
01:31:14,003 --> 01:31:18,170
"My heart feels like
to have you closer."

1618
01:31:18,253 --> 01:31:22,503
"And my heart is not
preventing me from doing it."

1619
01:31:22,586 --> 01:31:25,961
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1620
01:31:26,045 --> 01:31:28,211
"With your ringtone."

1621
01:31:28,295 --> 01:31:30,878
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1622
01:31:31,086 --> 01:31:34,420
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1623
01:31:34,503 --> 01:31:36,795
"With your ringtone."

1624
01:31:36,878 --> 01:31:39,920
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1625
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:53,128
"Oh my dear,
however closer you want me."

1626
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:57,378
"I'm no longer there,
you may go if you want."

1627
01:32:01,795 --> 01:32:06,003
"Oh my dear,
however closer you want me."

1628
01:32:06,086 --> 01:32:09,586
"I'm no longer there,
you may go if you want."

1629
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:13,920
"And my heart is not
preventing me from doing it."

1630
01:32:14,003 --> 01:32:17,336
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1631
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,628
"With your ringtone."

1632
01:32:19,711 --> 01:32:22,420
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1633
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:25,836
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1634
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,253
"With your ringtone."

1635
01:32:28,336 --> 01:32:31,420
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1636
01:32:48,961 --> 01:32:51,045
"My lies will never get caught."

1637
01:32:51,128 --> 01:32:52,878
"You can look for me everywhere."

1638
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:55,253
"I'm not going to
listen to your rules."

1639
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:57,211
"And not going to surrender too."

1640
01:33:01,753 --> 01:33:03,920
"My lies will never get caught."

1641
01:33:04,003 --> 01:33:05,961
"You can look for me everywhere."

1642
01:33:06,045 --> 01:33:08,170
"I'm not going to
listen to your rules."

1643
01:33:08,253 --> 01:33:09,503
"And not going to surrender too."

1644
01:33:09,586 --> 01:33:13,920
"And my heart is not
preventing me from doing it."

1645
01:33:14,003 --> 01:33:17,336
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1646
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:19,628
"With your ringtone."

1647
01:33:19,711 --> 01:33:22,503
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1648
01:33:22,586 --> 01:33:26,045
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1649
01:33:26,128 --> 01:33:28,253
"With your ringtone."

1650
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:31,045
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1651
01:33:31,128 --> 01:33:33,628
"Oh dear miss you, miss you."

1652
01:33:33,711 --> 01:33:35,378
"Wish to have you closer."

1653
01:33:35,461 --> 01:33:39,586
"My heart feels like
to have you closer."

1654
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:44,170
"And my heart is not
preventing me from doing it."

1655
01:33:44,336 --> 01:33:47,503
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1656
01:33:47,586 --> 01:33:49,670
"With your ringtone."

1657
01:33:49,753 --> 01:33:52,420
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1658
01:33:52,503 --> 01:33:56,086
"Cell phone is ringing in my heart."

1659
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:58,211
"With your ringtone."

1660
01:33:58,295 --> 01:34:01,461
"Come closer and listen to me,
Oh my dear."

1661
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,545
- Khosla?
- Yes boss.

1662
01:34:07,045 --> 01:34:10,211
Patla Poda might have lost
after coming to Bangkok.

1663
01:34:10,586 --> 01:34:12,170
Why're you saying like this boss?

1664
01:34:12,253 --> 01:34:15,170
So many days have passed,
yet no news of my Julie...

1665
01:34:15,378 --> 01:34:18,170
...and that Bijoy Palkiwala.

1666
01:34:18,378 --> 01:34:19,628
You'll get them boss, you'll get them.

1667
01:34:19,711 --> 01:34:21,253
Don't make me angry.

1668
01:34:21,336 --> 01:34:25,461
If I get hold of that Bijoy...

1669
01:34:26,003 --> 01:34:29,045
Bijoy means, the one who was
supposed to get married to Tina...

1670
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:30,545
...but Tina got married to Joy.

1671
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:34,920
Hello sir.

1672
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,503
Who the hell are you man?

1673
01:34:36,586 --> 01:34:39,211
Sir, I'm not a hell,
my name is Sumanta Batliwala.

1674
01:34:39,295 --> 01:34:41,295
I couldn't stop myself from coming
here, after I heard your conversation.

1675
01:34:41,503 --> 01:34:42,545
Straight away entered here.

1676
01:34:42,711 --> 01:34:44,586
Sir, is Julie your sister?

1677
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:45,503
Yes, why?

1678
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:48,503
Has he married any guy named Bijoy?

1679
01:34:48,586 --> 01:34:52,628
- Hey, don't make me angry.
- Please don't mind.

1680
01:34:52,711 --> 01:34:54,670
Say fast, whatever you have to.

1681
01:34:54,753 --> 01:34:59,961
Sir, what I want to say is that your case
and my case is somewhat linked together.

1682
01:35:00,045 --> 01:35:00,628
What do you mean?

1683
01:35:00,711 --> 01:35:05,795
I mean, I'll start investigating
in disguise from tomorrow onwards.

1684
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:09,295
And will find out red handed
who's staying with whom, yeah!

1685
01:35:11,545 --> 01:35:12,961
- Your tea is getting cold.
- Yes Julie.

1686
01:35:13,253 --> 01:35:15,628
Excuse me sir, room service.

1687
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:16,878
Come in!

1688
01:35:20,461 --> 01:35:22,586
These two are here.

1689
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,920
Hello...your order sir!

1690
01:35:27,128 --> 01:35:27,920
Keep it there.

1691
01:35:28,003 --> 01:35:29,003
Okay.

1692
01:35:30,045 --> 01:35:33,920
We're somehow saved
from my elder brother...

1693
01:35:34,003 --> 01:35:36,878
...but if he comes to know,
we'll be finished.

1694
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:40,045
Where does your bro punch directly?

1695
01:35:40,795 --> 01:35:43,253
No punching this time.
He'll fire up straight away.

1696
01:35:43,753 --> 01:35:47,920
Let's do one thing,
let's both of us fall in his knees.

1697
01:35:48,878 --> 01:35:51,253
Won't be able to get up after falling.
Think of something else.

1698
01:35:51,336 --> 01:35:53,378
Should I distribute sir?

1699
01:35:53,711 --> 01:35:55,003
We'll help ourselves okay?

1700
01:35:55,086 --> 01:35:56,503
Okay sir.

1701
01:35:57,211 --> 01:35:58,586
Not getting any idea.

1702
01:35:59,045 --> 01:35:59,961
Let's ask, Joy.

1703
01:36:00,045 --> 01:36:00,753
Right.

1704
01:36:03,586 --> 01:36:04,836
Which room is he in?

1705
01:36:05,878 --> 01:36:06,670
616.

1706
01:36:07,295 --> 01:36:08,711
616.

1707
01:36:10,753 --> 01:36:11,961
616.

1708
01:36:15,382 --> 01:36:16,628
Who the hell has come now?

1709
01:36:16,711 --> 01:36:17,753
Come in.

1710
01:36:18,795 --> 01:36:20,086
Hello.

1711
01:36:22,545 --> 01:36:23,461
What's the matter?

1712
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:25,836
This is your lunch sir.

1713
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,628
Did you order lunch?

1714
01:36:27,711 --> 01:36:28,711
Nopes.

1715
01:36:29,253 --> 01:36:30,211
You have it.

1716
01:36:31,586 --> 01:36:33,128
No thank you.
We'll have it in the restaurant.

1717
01:36:33,336 --> 01:36:37,045
No sir, this is complimentary,
on the house.

1718
01:36:37,878 --> 01:36:39,586
Thank you. Keep it. You may go now.

1719
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:41,253
Okay sir.

1720
01:36:42,586 --> 01:36:44,378
Happy honeymoon!

1721
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:47,711
Please go.

1722
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:49,378
Everything messed up.

1723
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:51,045
What did you say?

1724
01:36:51,128 --> 01:36:53,545
Nothing ma'am nothing.
I'm just leaving.

1725
01:36:55,086 --> 01:36:56,628
Have a nice day.

1726
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:06,170
Joy is residing with Priyanka leaving
his wife? Everything messed up.

1727
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:09,795
Then who's that girl residing with?
Need to find out.

1728
01:37:11,503 --> 01:37:13,795
It's 100 percent defectiveness.

1729
01:37:14,336 --> 01:37:18,795
Now, if I get to know who's she residing
with, then the game would be mine.

1730
01:37:18,878 --> 01:37:20,086
- Hello.
- Hello.

1731
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:24,670
Then I need to finish their game.

1732
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:27,961
I'm not feeling comfortable,
unless you get your divorce.

1733
01:37:28,128 --> 01:37:29,670
- See...
- Room Service.

1734
01:37:30,545 --> 01:37:31,795
Has come.

1735
01:37:32,086 --> 01:37:32,961
Who has come?

1736
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:35,503
My beloved thing...

1737
01:37:35,878 --> 01:37:38,753
...which is going to get me saturated.

1738
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,086
Hello.

1739
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:40,836
Only drink.

1740
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:41,461
Hello.

1741
01:37:41,545 --> 01:37:42,961
You've ordered drink?

1742
01:37:44,253 --> 01:37:46,628
Yes darling.
I mean just a small patch.

1743
01:37:46,878 --> 01:37:48,711
I won't allow you to drink.
How dare you do it?

1744
01:37:48,795 --> 01:37:49,295
Got It.

1745
01:37:49,378 --> 01:37:50,336
Now I have come back to you.
What is wrong then?

1746
01:37:50,545 --> 01:37:53,586
Joy's wife is now residing with Shaan.

1747
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:57,461
See when you were not there,
then used to drink in sadness.

1748
01:37:57,545 --> 01:37:59,378
And now in happiness.

1749
01:37:59,461 --> 01:38:03,545
- No. I won't allow you. After marriage.
- Oh My God. Superb love.

1750
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:06,170
- Excuse me. Please Leave.
- Tina.

1751
01:38:06,253 --> 01:38:08,003
- Thank you sir.
- Listen to me...

1752
01:38:09,836 --> 01:38:13,545
Confusion. Who's residing with whom...

1753
01:38:13,628 --> 01:38:17,003
...needs to be informed to
the head office, I mean Joy's dad.

1754
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:19,461
Hello, who's this?

1755
01:38:19,545 --> 01:38:21,878
Uncle, this is Sumanta
here from Bangkok.

1756
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:25,211
Bangkok? There my son
has gone for Honeymoon.

1757
01:38:25,836 --> 01:38:27,461
What the hell are you doing there?

1758
01:38:27,545 --> 01:38:29,586
I have scooped everything out.

1759
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:30,711
What happened?

1760
01:38:30,795 --> 01:38:32,795
Let me hear completely, then saying.

1761
01:38:33,295 --> 01:38:34,878
I'm not getting anything.

1762
01:38:34,961 --> 01:38:38,420
Your son is not in his
honeymoon with his wife Tina.

1763
01:38:38,586 --> 01:38:42,045
What not in the honeymoon?
Then what are they doing?

1764
01:38:42,128 --> 01:38:44,711
I mean he's in honeymoon
with a girl named Priyanka.

1765
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,836
And your daughter-in-law Tina
is spending nights with a guy named Shaan.

1766
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,086
My daughter-in-law?

1767
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:52,586
What happened tell me?

1768
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:55,128
Rubbish! Let me hear it completely.

1769
01:38:56,336 --> 01:38:58,628
I think the guy,
whose marriage you've been...

1770
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:02,461
...his name is Bijoy and
he's with a girl named Julie.

1771
01:39:03,211 --> 01:39:06,336
Uncle, here there's a lot
of confusion in terms of residing.

1772
01:39:06,545 --> 01:39:07,461
Confusion?

1773
01:39:08,628 --> 01:39:10,295
What happened tell me?

1774
01:39:10,378 --> 01:39:13,961
Won't tell you.
Won't. Will feed you completely.

1775
01:39:15,086 --> 01:39:18,170
They don't know me what I can do now.

1776
01:39:18,253 --> 01:39:21,045
What happened tell me please?
Are they alright?

1777
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:24,045
That is what I'm trying to survey.

1778
01:39:24,503 --> 01:39:25,711
Yes, got the line.

1779
01:39:26,836 --> 01:39:27,920
Pick up the phone?

1780
01:39:29,295 --> 01:39:30,420
Good morning.

1781
01:39:30,628 --> 01:39:32,003
I mean good morning.

1782
01:39:32,086 --> 01:39:34,253
Are you a boy or a girl?

1783
01:39:34,336 --> 01:39:38,545
I'm the receptionist
of Bangkok's playboy resort...

1784
01:39:38,628 --> 01:39:42,461
...and yes there's no room empty
for the next seven days. Hanging down.

1785
01:39:42,711 --> 01:39:45,586
Don't. Don't disconnect.

1786
01:39:45,836 --> 01:39:48,795
My son Joy is in room no 616.

1787
01:39:49,003 --> 01:39:51,878
His mobile is switched off.
Give him the line.

1788
01:39:51,961 --> 01:39:56,253
Ok giving.
Your voice sounds like a thunderstorm.

1789
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:02,253
Hello.

1790
01:40:02,336 --> 01:40:04,461
Your dad is in the line. Talk to him.

1791
01:40:04,545 --> 01:40:05,420
Yes.

1792
01:40:05,753 --> 01:40:09,461
Julie, your dad has called.
I think he has accepted you.

1793
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:14,336
Strange! Not telling me anything.
I'm really afraid now.

1794
01:40:14,836 --> 01:40:16,878
Hello dad? Have you accepted?

1795
01:40:16,961 --> 01:40:18,545
What should I accept my son?

1796
01:40:18,628 --> 01:40:22,045
Shit, this is not my dad,
this is Joy's dad.

1797
01:40:22,253 --> 01:40:23,878
Who are you speaking son?

1798
01:40:24,128 --> 01:40:28,711
Dad, I'm your son. Joy.

1799
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,586
Hmm. Where's my daughter in law?

1800
01:40:30,961 --> 01:40:33,253
She is standing aside.

1801
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:36,503
Why are you sounding like this?

1802
01:40:36,753 --> 01:40:39,295
This is definitely not my son's voice.

1803
01:40:39,503 --> 01:40:44,461
No. I'm your son Joy. Actually I'm
directly suffering from cough and cold.

1804
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,295
Directly?
This is the way Bijoy speaks.

1805
01:40:48,795 --> 01:40:49,920
Hello.

1806
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:51,503
How're you dad?

1807
01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:53,545
Now you disconnect
the phone directly my son.

1808
01:40:53,753 --> 01:40:56,295
Shit, the case is now jaundice.

1809
01:40:56,711 --> 01:40:59,628
Now I think Sumanta was right.

1810
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:01,795
Would you please tell me
what have you come to know?

1811
01:41:01,878 --> 01:41:05,795
First of all, I'll speak to Charan,
and then will let you know.

1812
01:41:06,128 --> 01:41:12,378
He is very happy dumping her
characterless daughter Tina over my son.

1813
01:41:12,461 --> 01:41:13,003
What is it?

1814
01:41:13,086 --> 01:41:15,211
That means your daughter-in-law...

1815
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:19,961
...in spending her nights in Bangkok
with a guy named Shaan in the same room.

1816
01:41:20,045 --> 01:41:23,711
What? Then my Joy? What is he doing?

1817
01:41:23,795 --> 01:41:26,211
He's doing his honeymoon
with Priyanka.

1818
01:41:26,295 --> 01:41:28,753
- What?
- Leave him. He's an idiot.

1819
01:41:29,295 --> 01:41:31,711
But the main culprit is that Charan.

1820
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:35,628
I'm not going to leave him.
I'll thrash him to hell.

1821
01:41:35,711 --> 01:41:37,086
Oh my God!

1822
01:41:37,378 --> 01:41:39,378
Hey, this is your phone.

1823
01:41:41,336 --> 01:41:41,878
Hello.

1824
01:41:41,961 --> 01:41:47,711
What hello? Hell with your hello.
You've cheated me.

1825
01:41:47,795 --> 01:41:50,086
Whom have you forced my son to marry?

1826
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:53,795
What? Joy is married to Tina.
Don't you remember?

1827
01:41:53,878 --> 01:41:54,586
Shut up.

1828
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:59,836
Got a news from Bangkok that Tina is
roaming around with a guy named Shaan.

1829
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,003
- Shaan?
- What happened?

1830
01:42:01,086 --> 01:42:02,045
How does he get there?

1831
01:42:02,128 --> 01:42:04,711
Don't pretend. You knew everything.

1832
01:42:04,795 --> 01:42:07,128
Tina is a characterless girl...

1833
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:09,378
...and that is why Bijoy
ran away on the day of marriage.

1834
01:42:09,461 --> 01:42:13,336
And you've created a drama
to get my son marry that girl?

1835
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:17,253
When did I do that? You only
forced your son Joy to marry Tina.

1836
01:42:17,336 --> 01:42:21,961
I couldn't get your mischief. What
do you think? I don't know anything?

1837
01:42:22,211 --> 01:42:24,503
Your son Bijoy is now in Bangkok?

1838
01:42:24,753 --> 01:42:26,753
Bijoy in Bangkok? Can't be.

1839
01:42:26,836 --> 01:42:30,170
Pretending as if
you don't know anything.

1840
01:42:30,336 --> 01:42:32,253
Believe me Raju,
I don't know anything.

1841
01:42:32,336 --> 01:42:34,086
You come with me to Bangkok.

1842
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,961
I'll show you the proof live.

1843
01:42:36,253 --> 01:42:41,545
And if this comes true, I'll put you
and that heart attack master in jail.

1844
01:42:41,628 --> 01:42:43,836
I'll surely come with you to Bangkok.

1845
01:42:44,086 --> 01:42:47,336
But before that I'll
sue that Raghab Roy.

1846
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:50,461
Hey Charan? What's up? Are you fine?

1847
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:53,295
You are a bustard. Nasty. Cheat.

1848
01:42:53,378 --> 01:42:55,253
Hey! What're you saying?

1849
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:57,545
Don't get excited sir,
or else it'll go high.

1850
01:42:57,628 --> 01:42:58,211
Shut up.

1851
01:42:58,295 --> 01:43:00,420
What shut up?
Your daughter is an institute?

1852
01:43:00,503 --> 01:43:02,211
Not institute? It's prostitute.

1853
01:43:02,295 --> 01:43:03,503
Yes. Prostitute.

1854
01:43:03,586 --> 01:43:04,378
Charan!

1855
01:43:04,461 --> 01:43:08,420
Hey lower your voice.
For you my friendship is cut off.

1856
01:43:08,628 --> 01:43:12,836
Your daughter Tina is roaming about
in Bangkok with a guy named Shaan?

1857
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,253
This can't be.

1858
01:43:14,336 --> 01:43:17,253
I have the proof,
Shaan is the guy of your locality.

1859
01:43:17,336 --> 01:43:19,253
He used to mingle
with Tina from before.

1860
01:43:19,336 --> 01:43:20,545
You knew everything.

1861
01:43:20,628 --> 01:43:23,461
You've hidden everything from me;
I'm not going to leave you.

1862
01:43:23,545 --> 01:43:26,170
Come to Bangkok.
I'll show you live proof.

1863
01:43:26,253 --> 01:43:27,961
- Okay.
- Yes. Go ahead.

1864
01:43:28,378 --> 01:43:32,378
Yes. You are Priyanka's dad,
Dhanakrishna Dhali?

1865
01:43:32,461 --> 01:43:35,420
Yes. Absolutely right?
And you are Joy's dad.

1866
01:43:36,003 --> 01:43:38,836
Yes, but you have not seen me before.

1867
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,336
No. I can't see.

1868
01:43:40,628 --> 01:43:43,961
Yes I had heard from
Joy that you can't see.

1869
01:43:44,295 --> 01:43:46,420
Then how did you recognize me?

1870
01:43:46,503 --> 01:43:48,753
With this, nose, two-in one.

1871
01:43:48,961 --> 01:43:51,211
I can see with this nose
and even smell too.

1872
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:55,336
Quiet. You're trying to go
high being on a low category?

1873
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,461
I do not stay low,
I pour, how would I go high?

1874
01:43:57,628 --> 01:43:58,836
Shut up.

1875
01:43:59,336 --> 01:44:01,128
My son Joy is married.

1876
01:44:01,211 --> 01:44:05,086
You've insisted your daughter
Priyanka to go behind my son?

1877
01:44:05,170 --> 01:44:06,878
Is this your family business?

1878
01:44:06,961 --> 01:44:08,045
Didn't get you.

1879
01:44:08,128 --> 01:44:10,253
Don't pretend. You know everything.

1880
01:44:11,378 --> 01:44:13,795
Joy is in Bangkok for
Honeymoon and there...

1881
01:44:13,878 --> 01:44:15,795
...your daughter Priyanka
is roaming with him.

1882
01:44:15,878 --> 01:44:20,128
What? Why can't you control your bull,
who's running after other girls?

1883
01:44:20,211 --> 01:44:23,086
You're bad, your daughter is bad...

1884
01:44:23,378 --> 01:44:26,170
...your family is bad, and the ones
who are gonna come in future...

1885
01:44:26,253 --> 01:44:27,211
...even they are bad too.

1886
01:44:27,295 --> 01:44:28,461
Why are they bad?

1887
01:44:28,545 --> 01:44:30,836
Because your daughter
is running behind my bull.

1888
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,253
I don't believe you.

1889
01:44:32,336 --> 01:44:34,920
First of all I'll see it
with my nose then believe it.

1890
01:44:35,003 --> 01:44:38,086
Is it? Then come to Bangkok
with this nose of yours.

1891
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:41,420
Surely. But before that
need Vishnupriya's permission?

1892
01:44:43,503 --> 01:44:46,420
Vishnupriya, Vishnupriya.

1893
01:44:47,628 --> 01:44:49,711
Vishnupriya, will I go to Bangkok?

1894
01:44:54,128 --> 01:44:55,628
She has permitted.

1895
01:44:55,711 --> 01:44:58,086
Great. Now let's go to Bangkok.

1896
01:45:12,586 --> 01:45:14,628
Here is this Playboy Hotel.

1897
01:45:15,003 --> 01:45:16,461
Get down fast.

1898
01:45:16,545 --> 01:45:19,045
Shut up. Always work without planning.

1899
01:45:19,253 --> 01:45:23,128
Sumanta is a kid. Based on what
he has said, everybody has turned up.

1900
01:45:23,336 --> 01:45:24,628
You should have investigated.

1901
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:28,503
Don't need your advice.
I'm not here for nothing.

1902
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:31,670
Everything is your guess.
Don't I know my daughter?

1903
01:45:31,753 --> 01:45:35,128
Instead of arguing outside,
let's go inside to get the news.

1904
01:45:35,211 --> 01:45:36,336
- Exactly.
- Now come.

1905
01:45:39,586 --> 01:45:42,545
Madam, please dial nine
for room service.

1906
01:45:43,336 --> 01:45:44,628
Thank you.

1907
01:45:45,753 --> 01:45:47,295
Hello.

1908
01:45:47,503 --> 01:45:49,045
Welcome to Playboy Resort.

1909
01:45:49,128 --> 01:45:51,086
What the hell is this saying?

1910
01:45:51,836 --> 01:45:53,253
Bengali I guess?

1911
01:45:53,336 --> 01:45:55,670
People of Nicaragua
doesn't speak in Bengali.

1912
01:45:55,753 --> 01:45:58,295
When speaking in Bengali,
that means we're Bengalis. Hell.

1913
01:45:58,378 --> 01:46:00,836
Oh My God! Yes hell indeed.

1914
01:46:01,003 --> 01:46:03,753
Did you know none of
the rooms were empty here.

1915
01:46:03,836 --> 01:46:06,545
But a few moments back
four rooms have been vacated.

1916
01:46:06,628 --> 01:46:08,003
So how many do you want?

1917
01:46:08,086 --> 01:46:10,461
Dear, is this boy or a girl?

1918
01:46:10,545 --> 01:46:11,836
Mischievous aunty.

1919
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,170
We need four rooms. Hell.

1920
01:46:14,336 --> 01:46:16,711
Oh my God!
Everything with tight fitting.

1921
01:46:17,045 --> 01:46:19,128
Now, fill this form up.

1922
01:46:19,211 --> 01:46:21,545
I have something to
ask before filling the form.

1923
01:46:21,628 --> 01:46:24,461
Has anyone named Bijoy
booked a room here?

1924
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:29,128
Not only Bijoy, Joy Bijoy and Shaan,
three handsome guys...

1925
01:46:29,336 --> 01:46:33,128
...have booked a room and is
spending honeymoon with their wives.

1926
01:46:33,211 --> 01:46:35,170
Shaan? When did Shaan marry?

1927
01:46:35,253 --> 01:46:38,545
Sir... Don't get excited.
Your strokes have crossed century.

1928
01:46:38,628 --> 01:46:40,795
Shut up doctor.
It's my stroke, let me handle it.

1929
01:46:40,878 --> 01:46:44,878
Okay, has any girl
named Priyanka come here?

1930
01:46:45,086 --> 01:46:48,586
That I don't know. The thing I'm
interested in, can reveal that only.

1931
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:51,253
Mr. Gopal. This is the first time
that my nose has betrayed me.

1932
01:46:51,336 --> 01:46:52,336
What the hell is this?

1933
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:55,211
Leave it.
Okay, where can we get them now?

1934
01:46:55,628 --> 01:46:57,753
I mean, can you give us
their room numbers?

1935
01:46:57,836 --> 01:47:00,503
Of course I can, but they
are not in their rooms right now.

1936
01:47:00,795 --> 01:47:02,545
They have gone for
an outing in couples.

1937
01:47:02,628 --> 01:47:03,461
Very good.

1938
01:47:04,003 --> 01:47:06,295
When they have gone out.
They are bound to come back.

1939
01:47:07,086 --> 01:47:09,461
We'll wait here and
catch them red handed.

1940
01:47:09,545 --> 01:47:13,003
We'll be waiting for them for so long?
This is going beyond the limits.

1941
01:47:13,086 --> 01:47:18,461
Not at all. Rajballav visits till the end,
whenever he takes up anything.

1942
01:47:18,628 --> 01:47:20,795
We'll take the news
and then enter the rooms.

1943
01:47:21,003 --> 01:47:23,836
No...can't agree to you every time.

1944
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,253
You're right.

1945
01:47:25,461 --> 01:47:26,586
Take the keys, come to the room.

1946
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:28,670
Let's freshen up first,
and then do whatever you like.

1947
01:47:30,045 --> 01:47:31,128
- Okay. Let's do it.
- Let's go.

1948
01:47:31,253 --> 01:47:33,670
Give the keys. Form the signature.

1949
01:47:35,128 --> 01:47:37,753
Here it is. The keys.

1950
01:47:37,836 --> 01:47:39,461
Okay. Let's go.

1951
01:47:42,128 --> 01:47:46,836
Everyone is in their rooms.
But where's mine?

1952
01:47:47,992 --> 01:47:51,170
Vishnupriya. Please help me.

1953
01:47:51,878 --> 01:47:53,170
Vishnupriya.

1954
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,461
I can smell Vishnupriya here.

1955
01:47:58,795 --> 01:48:01,420
Vishnupriya. Vishnupriya.

1956
01:48:01,753 --> 01:48:03,128
Hey Mr. two in one.

1957
01:48:03,336 --> 01:48:04,378
Who's this?

1958
01:48:05,045 --> 01:48:06,295
Oh, Mr. Raghab.

1959
01:48:06,378 --> 01:48:09,670
Yeah, this is not your room.
It's more ahead.

1960
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:14,711
Thank you. Since I have the
two in one, I'll find it out myself.

1961
01:48:15,795 --> 01:48:17,003
Thank you sir.

1962
01:48:19,128 --> 01:48:22,253
See this boy. This is Sumanta.

1963
01:48:22,336 --> 01:48:25,128
We've come here, based on his news.

1964
01:48:25,211 --> 01:48:26,836
Hello to all of you.

1965
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,586
We take the hello, but not the news.

1966
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:31,961
Are you speaking the truth or lying?

1967
01:48:32,045 --> 01:48:33,920
Oh my God ! Why should it be a lie?

1968
01:48:34,045 --> 01:48:37,170
I've even found out something new.

1969
01:48:38,586 --> 01:48:41,420
See there. Patla Poda.

1970
01:48:41,795 --> 01:48:44,920
He is in search of Bijoy and Julie.

1971
01:48:46,295 --> 01:48:48,003
So he is Patla Poda?

1972
01:48:49,003 --> 01:48:50,170
"His day or my day"?

1973
01:48:50,253 --> 01:48:50,711
What?

1974
01:48:50,795 --> 01:48:52,420
I'll scoop him out.

1975
01:48:52,878 --> 01:48:56,003
Don't go, where are you going there?
He is a bad man.

1976
01:48:57,211 --> 01:48:58,836
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1977
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:02,211
Hey Mister? You're Patla Poda?

1978
01:49:02,295 --> 01:49:04,461
Your sister has insisted
my son to run away.

1979
01:49:04,545 --> 01:49:07,128
I'm out of prestige because of you.

1980
01:49:07,211 --> 01:49:10,670
Oh my God! In front of whom
do you resemble yourself as Don?

1981
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:13,003
That means out of prestige.

1982
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:16,045
You are Haridas Palkiwala?

1983
01:49:16,128 --> 01:49:17,045
No. I mean Charandas.

1984
01:49:18,336 --> 01:49:20,045
Father of a characterless son.

1985
01:49:20,128 --> 01:49:22,628
Mind your language.

1986
01:49:22,795 --> 01:49:27,336
It's because of your sister
that my prestige has gone down.

1987
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:29,753
Let me get hold of your son once...

1988
01:49:29,836 --> 01:49:36,545
...and then I'll show you
where your prestige would be.

1989
01:49:36,878 --> 01:49:38,836
Will scoop you out.

1990
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,920
Oh my God !
This is going beyond the limit.

1991
01:49:41,086 --> 01:49:44,628
After all,
they are legally married Mr. Patla?

1992
01:49:44,711 --> 01:49:50,961
Hey, It's Patla...Got it?
I don't go by that registry.

1993
01:49:51,170 --> 01:49:55,795
I don't get the son,
then will fire the dad out.

1994
01:49:56,253 --> 01:50:01,253
See Mr. Patla. All of us,
are in the same trouble now.

1995
01:50:02,003 --> 01:50:03,711
Everything is confusion here.

1996
01:50:03,795 --> 01:50:08,670
That is exactly why I
have got hold of all the dads.

1997
01:50:08,961 --> 01:50:12,545
Uncle, the news of confusion is already
leaked from the reception itself.

1998
01:50:12,628 --> 01:50:16,461
That Joy, Bijoy and Shaan are residing
in their rooms, along with their wives.

1999
01:50:16,545 --> 01:50:18,503
But all the wives have changed.

2000
01:50:18,586 --> 01:50:21,961
They would turn up after a while.
So see it for yourself.

2001
01:50:24,295 --> 01:50:25,586
We need to plan up everything.

2002
01:50:25,670 --> 01:50:26,211
You're right.

2003
01:50:26,295 --> 01:50:27,045
If I am talking...

2004
01:50:27,836 --> 01:50:30,378
Do you know why we are here?

2005
01:50:31,336 --> 01:50:35,045
They are about to return now.
Will catch them red handed.

2006
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:42,170
But what I think is, yeah look there.

2007
01:50:43,378 --> 01:50:44,670
We need to focus on everything.

2008
01:50:45,086 --> 01:50:47,003
Where will you run now?

2009
01:50:47,086 --> 01:50:48,795
Hey, what're you doing? Leave her.

2010
01:50:49,253 --> 01:50:50,336
Uncle, you?

2011
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:52,253
Yes, it's me.

2012
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:53,753
You've come too.

2013
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,253
What to do? Had to come to
witness such a case of confusion.

2014
01:50:57,336 --> 01:51:00,295
My son and daughter in
law are here for honeymoon.

2015
01:51:00,378 --> 01:51:03,336
What're you doing here? Getting fried?

2016
01:51:03,503 --> 01:51:05,253
Priyanka. Who're they?

2017
01:51:06,045 --> 01:51:10,211
Uncle, this is my would be husband.
We're here for a honeymoon.

2018
01:51:10,878 --> 01:51:13,295
What rubbish? You and Joy?

2019
01:51:13,670 --> 01:51:16,003
Yeah... I work with Joy.

2020
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:20,045
He's my boss.
And they're Joy's parents.

2021
01:51:21,836 --> 01:51:23,045
Parents of Joy?

2022
01:51:23,128 --> 01:51:24,336
Yes.

2023
01:51:25,003 --> 01:51:29,128
But uncle, why're you here?

2024
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:32,003
To check that how's
your son performing?

2025
01:51:32,086 --> 01:51:37,378
Yes. No respect for elders?
Why should I be interested in that?

2026
01:51:37,753 --> 01:51:40,336
I'm here to know who's
my son doing honeymoon with.

2027
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:43,753
Why? He's doing honeymoon
with the one whom he has married.

2028
01:51:44,545 --> 01:51:45,961
That means, Joy and Tina?

2029
01:51:46,045 --> 01:51:50,461
Let's go. Let's go for a pre honeymoon.
Bye uncle. Bye Aunty.

2030
01:51:50,545 --> 01:51:52,461
Pre honeymoon. Would be husband.

2031
01:51:52,753 --> 01:51:56,170
What nonsense is this?
Can't get it at all.

2032
01:51:56,253 --> 01:51:57,711
You don't need to even.

2033
01:51:57,878 --> 01:51:59,336
Would have been better in your age.

2034
01:51:59,545 --> 01:52:00,295
What rubbish?

2035
01:52:00,378 --> 01:52:02,003
Nowadays everything is in due slip.

2036
01:52:05,045 --> 01:52:06,045
It's Priyanka's phone.

2037
01:52:06,128 --> 01:52:07,670
Hello Priyanka.

2038
01:52:07,878 --> 01:52:08,961
Where're you?

2039
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:10,545
Tina and me are entering the hotel.

2040
01:52:10,628 --> 01:52:13,795
No, no, back off. Don't enter.

2041
01:52:13,878 --> 01:52:14,503
Why? What happened?

2042
01:52:14,586 --> 01:52:16,211
Joy's dad.

2043
01:52:16,711 --> 01:52:18,295
Joy's dad? Where?

2044
01:52:18,545 --> 01:52:19,545
Inside.

2045
01:52:19,628 --> 01:52:20,586
Inside?

2046
01:52:20,670 --> 01:52:21,711
Inside the hotel.

2047
01:52:21,795 --> 01:52:23,836
Oh my God ! We're finished.

2048
01:52:24,128 --> 01:52:25,503
How did he come here?

2049
01:52:25,586 --> 01:52:26,961
I guess Sumanta has informed.

2050
01:52:27,045 --> 01:52:28,003
Sumanta?

2051
01:52:28,086 --> 01:52:28,711
What happened?

2052
01:52:28,795 --> 01:52:29,878
Joy's dad has come.

2053
01:52:29,961 --> 01:52:31,420
How did he come here?

2054
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:33,961
Daddy?

2055
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:35,753
Who's daddy?

2056
01:52:35,961 --> 01:52:36,878
My dad.

2057
01:52:37,045 --> 01:52:37,795
Where?

2058
01:52:37,878 --> 01:52:39,128
In front of me. Bye!

2059
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:41,628
How many marriages
would you do? Idiot?

2060
01:52:41,836 --> 01:52:43,420
Why're you roaming
around with Joy's wife?

2061
01:52:43,503 --> 01:52:44,503
Daddy, this is Shaan's wife?

2062
01:52:44,878 --> 01:52:46,836
I mean Joy's wife.

2063
01:52:47,086 --> 01:52:49,920
My wife is Julie.
But dad, why're you here?

2064
01:52:50,003 --> 01:52:54,086
Wait. I will tell you. Listen.

2065
01:52:54,711 --> 01:52:56,295
Listen!

2066
01:52:56,545 --> 01:52:58,545
- Bijoy.
- Come and see him.

2067
01:52:58,628 --> 01:53:00,503
- What would happen now?
- See what they're doing!

2068
01:53:00,586 --> 01:53:02,545
Got Palkiwala's son.

2069
01:53:02,753 --> 01:53:03,753
Hey.

2070
01:53:04,753 --> 01:53:07,961
- Run, run.
- See the condition of your son.

2071
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:11,961
Where have they gone?

2072
01:53:20,003 --> 01:53:21,836
Yes, yes, got him.

2073
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,253
Whom have you got?

2074
01:53:23,336 --> 01:53:24,753
Bijoy Palkiwala right?

2075
01:53:24,961 --> 01:53:27,170
I'm not the one whom
you're looking for.

2076
01:53:27,253 --> 01:53:30,586
The guy with your sister Bijoy Palkiwala
is playing hide and seek there.

2077
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:31,586
- Is it?
- Yes.

2078
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:32,336
Let's see.

2079
01:53:32,711 --> 01:53:33,920
Find out lad.

2080
01:53:35,711 --> 01:53:38,336
Bengali in Bangkok?

2081
01:53:39,545 --> 01:53:43,295
He must be the son of Palkiwala.
Fooled me.

2082
01:53:43,586 --> 01:53:46,961
Where's he? Where's he? Where's he?

2083
01:53:47,711 --> 01:53:51,503
Now where to find Tina and Joy?

2084
01:53:52,211 --> 01:53:53,628
The fact is very thrilling.

2085
01:53:53,711 --> 01:53:55,711
Yes. Here.
Here is my son-in-law.

2086
01:53:55,795 --> 01:53:57,503
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

2087
01:53:57,586 --> 01:53:59,003
But who's the girl beside him?

2088
01:53:59,086 --> 01:54:00,003
Superb right.

2089
01:54:01,128 --> 01:54:01,878
Caught you.

2090
01:54:01,961 --> 01:54:03,378
Dad? You?

2091
01:54:03,461 --> 01:54:04,753
Your Dad?

2092
01:54:04,961 --> 01:54:05,795
My dad's dad?

2093
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:07,128
I mean my father-in-law.

2094
01:54:08,295 --> 01:54:08,961
Are you fine dad?

2095
01:54:09,045 --> 01:54:12,753
You would be responsible
for my next heart attack and death.

2096
01:54:13,086 --> 01:54:13,753
Why dad?

2097
01:54:13,836 --> 01:54:17,253
You've married my daughter,
but here with some other girl?

2098
01:54:17,711 --> 01:54:18,461
She is not girl dad?

2099
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,878
Don't teach me who's a girl or a boy?

2100
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:23,128
She's Julie.
Daughter-in-law of Charan Das.

2101
01:54:23,211 --> 01:54:25,920
Then what are you doing with
the daughter-in-law of Charan Das?

2102
01:54:26,086 --> 01:54:29,836
Talking to her then will go
to my wife. I mean to your daughter.

2103
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:32,420
Everything is smelling confusion.

2104
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:50,128
What's the matter?
Walking around silently since then?

2105
01:54:50,336 --> 01:54:54,878
Yes. What I can assume, it
seems there's a big case going around.

2106
01:54:54,961 --> 01:54:56,253
Need to poke my nose in this now.

2107
01:54:56,461 --> 01:54:59,336
Where would you poke your nose in?

2108
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:04,211
I will go to Joy's room tomorrow
morning to find who he is staying with.

2109
01:55:04,545 --> 01:55:08,461
What's wrong with you?
You are his dad right?

2110
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:09,545
Being a dad you would
watch your son doing that?

2111
01:55:09,628 --> 01:55:11,753
No other option left for me Priyambada.
No other option left.

2112
01:55:11,836 --> 01:55:18,045
If I don't enter, I won't get any proof
and won't be able to shut the case.

2113
01:55:18,128 --> 01:55:19,545
- What?
- Yes. Will definitely enter.

2114
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:31,461
Where're you going?

2115
01:55:32,003 --> 01:55:32,795
To open the door.

2116
01:55:32,878 --> 01:55:34,586
No, no. Don't open the door.

2117
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:35,545
Why?

2118
01:55:35,628 --> 01:55:36,253
It must be bed tea.

2119
01:55:36,336 --> 01:55:39,128
Can be your dad too. You run away.

2120
01:55:39,545 --> 01:55:41,170
For that need to open the door.

2121
01:55:41,711 --> 01:55:44,420
Hide, hide, hide.

2122
01:55:44,586 --> 01:55:45,711
- What're you doing here?
- Yes !

2123
01:55:45,795 --> 01:55:47,878
I've seen,
your dad is knocking the door.

2124
01:55:47,961 --> 01:55:48,961
Now what should I do?

2125
01:55:49,045 --> 01:55:49,961
Do one thing.

2126
01:55:50,045 --> 01:55:52,336
Get underneath the bed,
and I'm sleeping on the bed.

2127
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:53,711
Priyanka, you open the door.

2128
01:55:54,253 --> 01:55:55,670
Go, go.

2129
01:56:03,878 --> 01:56:05,670
Uncle, you? Good morning.

2130
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:08,545
Have come here to see whether
the morning is good or bad.

2131
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:13,336
Coming to Bangkok and playing fool.

2132
01:56:15,711 --> 01:56:16,836
Who's this?

2133
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:20,711
Would be husband.
Didn't I tell you? Pre-honeymoon!

2134
01:56:23,586 --> 01:56:26,920
Yes right. Then where's Joy and Tina?

2135
01:56:27,086 --> 01:56:27,961
601.

2136
01:56:28,253 --> 01:56:29,336
601.

2137
01:56:36,795 --> 01:56:37,545
Come out.

2138
01:56:38,961 --> 01:56:41,211
Thank you Shaan for saving me.

2139
01:56:41,628 --> 01:56:43,586
What save?
Run for Tina's room immediately.

2140
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:45,211
Why should I go to her room?

2141
01:56:45,295 --> 01:56:48,336
Idiot, when your dad
will not find you in 601...

2142
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,045
...then there would
be a very big case.

2143
01:56:50,878 --> 01:56:51,545
Right.

2144
01:56:52,378 --> 01:56:55,711
Don't go through the main door,
or else you will be in trouble.

2145
01:56:55,878 --> 01:57:00,170
Do one thing. The way I have entered,
you go in the same way.

2146
01:57:00,503 --> 01:57:02,545
Okay. But what'll you do?

2147
01:57:02,628 --> 01:57:03,920
I'll stay with Priyanka.

2148
01:57:04,461 --> 01:57:05,628
Go fast.

2149
01:57:07,836 --> 01:57:10,836
Shaan don't pluck
flowers from my garden.

2150
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:11,711
Go.

2151
01:57:12,836 --> 01:57:16,336
Listen Joy.
My garden is now in your safe hands.

2152
01:57:17,753 --> 01:57:18,295
Oh my God!

2153
01:57:18,378 --> 01:57:19,045
Be careful.

2154
01:57:19,961 --> 01:57:21,045
Be careful.

2155
01:57:21,295 --> 01:57:21,878
Oh God!

2156
01:57:21,961 --> 01:57:22,836
Be careful.

2157
01:57:27,586 --> 01:57:32,545
Dad you? Good morning dad.
You in this hotel?

2158
01:57:32,628 --> 01:57:33,378
Where's Joy?

2159
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:37,628
Why dad? Is anything wrong with mom?
When did you arrive?

2160
01:57:37,795 --> 01:57:39,753
I want to know where's Joy?

2161
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:42,003
He's sleeping right there.

2162
01:57:42,545 --> 01:57:43,545
Who's there darling?

2163
01:57:43,628 --> 01:57:45,628
Dad has arrived from Kolkata.

2164
01:57:45,711 --> 01:57:48,128
Shut up. Don't lie in the morning.

2165
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:50,378
Why should he be here
in our honeymoon?

2166
01:57:50,461 --> 01:57:51,961
Just have a look if you don't believe?

2167
01:57:55,045 --> 01:58:00,420
Dad? Dad you're here?

2168
01:58:00,878 --> 01:58:01,961
Yes it's me.

2169
01:58:02,045 --> 01:58:03,170
Where's mom?

2170
01:58:03,795 --> 01:58:04,836
She's in this hotel itself.

2171
01:58:05,045 --> 01:58:06,170
But why?

2172
01:58:06,461 --> 01:58:09,920
Don't find necessary to tell you that.
Will tell the right person.

2173
01:58:15,878 --> 01:58:16,920
Where's Shaan?

2174
01:58:17,336 --> 01:58:18,128
In my garden.

2175
01:58:21,753 --> 01:58:23,128
Uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle.

2176
01:58:23,211 --> 01:58:26,045
Hey dear, I was looking for you.

2177
01:58:26,128 --> 01:58:27,461
Caught them red handed?

2178
01:58:27,545 --> 01:58:32,170
Yes. Absolutely. Would like
to give you a gift red handed.

2179
01:58:34,336 --> 01:58:35,420
You slapped me?

2180
01:58:35,503 --> 01:58:38,628
Don't you dare to inform
wrongly in future...

2181
01:58:38,711 --> 01:58:40,170
...else you would
severely be punished.

2182
01:58:40,336 --> 01:58:43,170
I've seen it myself
that Joy is with Tina.

2183
01:58:43,253 --> 01:58:44,836
They are fooling you.

2184
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:50,378
Joy is with Priyanka. Shaan
is with Tina and Bijoy is with Julie.

2185
01:58:53,253 --> 01:58:56,253
Uncle, you didn't believe me...

2186
01:58:56,961 --> 01:59:01,211
...but I swear on the name of my dead
father, I'll give you the right proof.

2187
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:09,586
When I've come here,
I'll get a glimpse of my daughter. Yes.

2188
01:59:20,628 --> 01:59:21,461
You are here?

2189
01:59:21,836 --> 01:59:23,753
That's what my question is.
What're you doing in this hotel?

2190
01:59:24,628 --> 01:59:26,586
This is my daughter's room.

2191
01:59:29,253 --> 01:59:31,170
Dad? You're here?

2192
01:59:31,836 --> 01:59:35,878
Hey what're you doing
with my daughter in one room?

2193
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:39,586
Again stroke, again stroke.
This is Stroke number 102.

2194
01:59:39,795 --> 01:59:40,503
Dad?

2195
01:59:42,795 --> 01:59:43,670
Dad?

2196
01:59:46,128 --> 01:59:47,211
Dad?

2197
01:59:59,128 --> 02:00:01,003
- Dad?
- Are you alright Dad?

2198
02:00:03,086 --> 02:00:04,336
Who? Who're you?

2199
02:00:04,628 --> 02:00:07,336
It's me Joy. Your son-in-law.

2200
02:00:07,628 --> 02:00:08,628
But where's the other one?

2201
02:00:09,045 --> 02:00:09,961
Who dad?

2202
02:00:10,461 --> 02:00:12,586
Who turned me to score 102?

2203
02:00:13,128 --> 02:00:14,336
Whom are you talking about dad?

2204
02:00:14,628 --> 02:00:15,920
You fainted in my arms.

2205
02:00:17,878 --> 02:00:18,920
Yes dad.

2206
02:00:19,753 --> 02:00:22,253
So this stroke of
mine was like no ball?

2207
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:24,670
Now should I consult
for a courier service?

2208
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,628
Are these photos transposed?

2209
02:01:35,795 --> 02:01:36,836
What're you saying sir?

2210
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:39,836
You're a retired chief justice.
Rajballabh Chowdhury.

2211
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,753
It's not that easy to make you a fool.

2212
02:01:41,961 --> 02:01:46,878
Aunty, I felt down from the
sixth floor while clicking the photos.

2213
02:01:47,211 --> 02:01:50,378
Got it. But what is your benefit
in this?

2214
02:01:50,461 --> 02:01:55,336
I am in loss. But only you
can make my dream successful.

2215
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:56,628
Didn't get that.

2216
02:01:56,836 --> 02:02:00,711
But tomorrow I'm gonna summon
all three of them and close this case.

2217
02:02:00,878 --> 02:02:01,795
Then mine would be open.

2218
02:02:01,878 --> 02:02:03,336
- What?
- Luck.

2219
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:33,378
I just can't believe
that they can do such a stuff.

2220
02:02:33,461 --> 02:02:37,336
That scoundrel Shaan
have instigated my daughter.

2221
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:38,378
Don't get excited sir.

2222
02:02:38,461 --> 02:02:40,920
But I haven't seen.

2223
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:45,836
But could understand through smell,
that there's indeed a big confusion.

2224
02:02:46,503 --> 02:02:49,253
I'm not going to leave
that Palkiwala's lad.

2225
02:02:49,336 --> 02:02:51,795
Six of you have fooled us around.

2226
02:02:52,461 --> 02:02:55,420
And now have come
out of your disguise.

2227
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,628
Now take a look at my decision.

2228
02:03:00,003 --> 02:03:01,295
- Dad?
- What dad?

2229
02:03:01,836 --> 02:03:03,420
Leaving your own wife...

2230
02:03:03,503 --> 02:03:06,128
...you're flirting around with the
daughter of that Dhanakrishna Dhali?

2231
02:03:06,211 --> 02:03:08,336
You have ruined my prestige.

2232
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:08,961
Uncle?

2233
02:03:09,128 --> 02:03:15,253
Shut up. You are just like your dad.

2234
02:03:15,336 --> 02:03:17,378
No why should only girls
be responsible?

2235
02:03:17,461 --> 02:03:21,461
Why can't the bulls
be tightly controlled?

2236
02:03:21,545 --> 02:03:23,086
You shut up.

2237
02:03:24,295 --> 02:03:28,253
Forcing your daughter to run behind
my son, and now talking rubbish?

2238
02:03:28,336 --> 02:03:32,836
Can't you control,
the way I'm doing it.

2239
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,170
I can control.

2240
02:03:34,461 --> 02:03:40,378
Stupid Idiot, You've created
a mess out of my arranged marriage?

2241
02:03:41,545 --> 02:03:43,336
See.. This is the way to be controlled.

2242
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:44,503
I'm showing it too.

2243
02:03:44,711 --> 02:03:51,128
- Such an idiot would be my son-in-law?
- It's hurting uncle.

2244
02:03:51,211 --> 02:03:52,503
Volume decreased sir.

2245
02:03:52,586 --> 02:03:53,920
You shut up.

2246
02:03:54,086 --> 02:03:56,961
What did you think,
should I let my daughter come to you?

2247
02:03:57,045 --> 02:03:59,920
Before that I should
have committed suicide.

2248
02:04:00,003 --> 02:04:03,086
I can handle that but before that
kindly accept me as your son in law.

2249
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:04,045
Shut up.

2250
02:04:04,128 --> 02:04:07,336
Don't you dare to call me father.

2251
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:12,795
Hey, now you're finished,
son of Palki!

2252
02:04:13,295 --> 02:04:14,378
We're married.

2253
02:04:14,628 --> 02:04:17,045
And your sister would become
widow if anything happens to me.

2254
02:04:17,128 --> 02:04:18,420
I'll definitely shoot you.

2255
02:04:19,711 --> 02:04:24,920
Stop Poda. Bijoy is my only son.

2256
02:04:25,003 --> 02:04:26,961
What is he doing?

2257
02:04:27,045 --> 02:04:28,420
Shoot me on his behalf.

2258
02:04:28,503 --> 02:04:29,878
No! No!

2259
02:04:29,961 --> 02:04:31,753
In my back.

2260
02:04:31,836 --> 02:04:36,920
Please don't shoot him.
I don't want to be a widow.

2261
02:04:37,003 --> 02:04:39,378
Bro, you shoot me,
that can handle this situation .

2262
02:04:39,461 --> 02:04:42,586
Is it a game or what?

2263
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,003
Charan is responsible for all this.

2264
02:04:44,461 --> 02:04:47,128
If you would have told me
on the day of marriage...

2265
02:04:47,211 --> 02:04:49,836
...that the daughter of
Raghab Roy is a characterless...

2266
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:54,628
Mind your language Mr. Gopal.
Don't talk rubbish about my daughter.

2267
02:04:55,045 --> 02:04:58,711
And what is your son? Innocent? Saint?

2268
02:04:58,878 --> 02:05:01,295
Correct. It's all your fault Raju.

2269
02:05:01,378 --> 02:05:03,170
My son has fled away
so what is your problem?

2270
02:05:03,253 --> 02:05:05,711
Why did you let Joy marry Tina
like this?

2271
02:05:05,795 --> 02:05:07,503
Correctly said.

2272
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:13,003
Charan? I wanted to help you
and you're putting me into trouble?

2273
02:05:13,086 --> 02:05:15,211
I'll see you out.

2274
02:05:15,295 --> 02:05:16,920
Mind your language.

2275
02:05:17,003 --> 02:05:20,628
You mind your language.
You don't know what I can do to you.

2276
02:05:20,711 --> 02:05:22,836
I can sue you here.

2277
02:05:23,086 --> 02:05:28,128
Even I won't spare you.
I'll do the same with you.

2278
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:31,545
This idiot is responsible.

2279
02:05:31,628 --> 02:05:34,128
- You called me an idiot?
- Yes. So?

2280
02:05:34,378 --> 02:05:37,170
Then you are a bull pig.

2281
02:05:43,378 --> 02:05:45,378
Again confusion?

2282
02:05:53,961 --> 02:05:55,336
Who's she?

2283
02:05:55,545 --> 02:05:56,878
I'm Sumanta's Mom.

2284
02:05:57,670 --> 02:06:02,420
I promised to get my son
married to Priyanka.

2285
02:06:03,503 --> 02:06:07,545
And you've made that easy.

2286
02:06:08,378 --> 02:06:09,586
Sumanta!

2287
02:06:09,670 --> 02:06:13,295
Yes, I'm here.

2288
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:16,378
- Do what I had said.
- Yes but what Mom?

2289
02:06:16,461 --> 02:06:19,295
Stupid, kidnap Priyanka and flee away.

2290
02:06:19,711 --> 02:06:20,920
Please come with me.

2291
02:06:28,336 --> 02:06:34,836
Take me along with you all. Since I
can smell and find out. It's the radar.

2292
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,586
Come on let's go.

2293
02:06:38,086 --> 02:06:41,420
Leave me rascal.

2294
02:06:43,086 --> 02:06:45,045
Hey, where're you
taking my chick away?

2295
02:06:57,128 --> 02:06:58,253
Sir.

2296
02:06:59,253 --> 02:07:00,295
Yes.

2297
02:07:00,378 --> 02:07:02,128
The scene resembles that
the villain is...

2298
02:07:02,211 --> 02:07:03,795
...bringing the heroine
and coming through this way.

2299
02:07:03,878 --> 02:07:07,836
Okay the people who would chase them
would be attacked by the fighters.

2300
02:07:08,045 --> 02:07:08,878
Okay this is the scene.

2301
02:07:08,961 --> 02:07:11,461
- Okay Master. Let's shoot.
- First class.

2302
02:07:11,545 --> 02:07:16,336
- Ready. Standby. Position
- Camera everything ready?

2303
02:07:17,045 --> 02:07:18,503
Come on.

2304
02:07:18,961 --> 02:07:19,628
Okay.

2305
02:07:19,711 --> 02:07:21,628
- Yes, ready.
- Roll camera?

2306
02:07:23,836 --> 02:07:24,836
Action...

2307
02:07:26,836 --> 02:07:28,045
Leave me.

2308
02:07:28,711 --> 02:07:30,711
I'll show you now.

2309
02:07:37,461 --> 02:07:39,628
Who're all these?

2310
02:07:39,711 --> 02:07:43,128
Behind this mess is Sumanta.

2311
02:07:43,211 --> 02:07:45,086
Dacoits brought by Sumanta.

2312
02:07:48,045 --> 02:07:50,211
Let's run.

2313
02:08:01,670 --> 02:08:04,128
Stop. Stop.

2314
02:08:20,670 --> 02:08:22,628
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Stupid!

2315
02:08:29,045 --> 02:08:30,878
Who're you all? Why're you beating us?

2316
02:08:31,128 --> 02:08:31,961
Who are they?

2317
02:08:33,586 --> 02:08:40,586
Wait. Here it is and give it to me.

2318
02:08:45,670 --> 02:08:47,711
What is happening here?

2319
02:08:48,170 --> 02:08:50,378
Hey, he is Priyanka's father.

2320
02:09:43,045 --> 02:09:44,045
Priyanka..

2321
02:09:45,295 --> 02:09:46,711
Priyanka..

2322
02:09:51,461 --> 02:09:53,253
Priyanka..

2323
02:09:56,628 --> 02:09:58,253
Leave her.

2324
02:09:58,961 --> 02:10:01,128
Hey listen. Run!

2325
02:10:03,086 --> 02:10:05,628
Wait for me.

2326
02:10:19,670 --> 02:10:22,628
- Hey you.
- Come on. Hurry up!

2327
02:10:24,878 --> 02:10:25,961
Sorry.

2328
02:10:28,170 --> 02:10:30,086
Why did you give me money?
Am I a beggar?

2329
02:10:35,503 --> 02:10:36,961
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

2330
02:10:38,993 --> 02:10:40,348
Why do you hit me?

2331
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:45,797
Patla Poda.

2332
02:11:03,753 --> 02:11:04,711
Cut.

2333
02:11:13,045 --> 02:11:14,628
Cut! Cut! Cut!

2334
02:11:15,878 --> 02:11:18,711
Who the hell yelling out cut?

2335
02:11:19,503 --> 02:11:20,670
Who's gonna cut whom?

2336
02:11:20,753 --> 02:11:23,336
Mister this is a shooting zone.

2337
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:25,211
Here there was a shoot for my film.

2338
02:11:25,503 --> 02:11:27,586
And you guys have
created a mess out of it.

2339
02:11:27,753 --> 02:11:29,170
Who is he?

2340
02:11:29,378 --> 02:11:31,170
- Are you Raj Chakraborty?
- Yes.

2341
02:11:32,003 --> 02:11:32,878
Hello.

2342
02:11:34,003 --> 02:11:35,503
Hello.

2343
02:11:35,670 --> 02:11:36,795
But what's the case?

2344
02:11:48,753 --> 02:11:55,878
Stop it.
See, the son-in-law's are not guilty.

2345
02:11:56,336 --> 02:11:57,211
What are you saying?

2346
02:11:57,295 --> 02:12:00,378
All the son-in-law's.
Please come here.

2347
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:09,086
Don't mind, Mr. Rajballabh,
Mr. Patla Poda, Raghab Babu.

2348
02:12:09,878 --> 02:12:12,295
Talking to you later, Mr. Charandas.

2349
02:12:13,086 --> 02:12:14,711
All are your faults.

2350
02:12:14,961 --> 02:12:15,795
How could that be?

2351
02:12:15,878 --> 02:12:17,670
Don't angry me.

2352
02:12:17,753 --> 02:12:20,378
Patla Poda can never make mistakes.

2353
02:12:21,211 --> 02:12:22,753
Are you getting married?

2354
02:12:23,336 --> 02:12:24,086
No.

2355
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:28,920
Then let them be happy
with whoever they feel like.

2356
02:12:29,003 --> 02:12:31,711
Will you please be clear?

2357
02:12:31,795 --> 02:12:36,045
You got your son married
to someone whom he doesn't know.

2358
02:12:37,086 --> 02:12:38,128
You are right.

2359
02:12:38,878 --> 02:12:41,545
Patla, do you love your sister?

2360
02:12:41,628 --> 02:12:42,628
Of course.

2361
02:12:43,753 --> 02:12:48,295
But do you know whom
sister Julie loves?

2362
02:12:49,045 --> 02:12:52,586
Love can't be fired with a gun.

2363
02:12:53,795 --> 02:12:57,753
You are hundred percent correct.

2364
02:12:58,461 --> 02:13:01,836
Raghab Babu, you've pretended
as a heart attack patient...

2365
02:13:02,045 --> 02:13:04,628
...and got your daughter
Tina married to Joy.

2366
02:13:04,961 --> 02:13:09,461
But your daughter Tina loves Shaan.

2367
02:13:11,295 --> 02:13:15,295
And Mr. Charandas you still
believes in religion at this era?

2368
02:13:15,378 --> 02:13:18,711
If your son can marry
a Christian girl...

2369
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:20,503
...and live happily
then what is your problem?

2370
02:13:21,253 --> 02:13:25,586
See, Mr. Raj we realize
that we've made a mistake.

2371
02:13:25,836 --> 02:13:27,795
But what's the solution now?

2372
02:13:28,003 --> 02:13:32,670
Let your son Joy, divorce Tina.

2373
02:13:33,253 --> 02:13:34,795
Tina would marry Shaan then.

2374
02:13:35,461 --> 02:13:36,795
And Joy would marry Priyanka.

2375
02:13:37,003 --> 02:13:38,545
Then what about me?

2376
02:13:40,545 --> 02:13:43,878
See Mr. Sumanta,
love can't be achieved forcefully.

2377
02:13:44,336 --> 02:13:46,795
- Mother!
- Calm down.

2378
02:13:47,003 --> 02:13:52,920
See Mr. Raj it was not right
to get my daughter married to Joy.

2379
02:13:53,378 --> 02:13:56,920
But from now on,
let's move on with their wishes.

2380
02:13:57,003 --> 02:14:01,128
Accept them Parvati.

2381
02:14:01,586 --> 02:14:03,378
But her elder bro is a dacoit.

2382
02:14:04,295 --> 02:14:09,628
I quit that from today onwards.
I swear on my sister.

2383
02:14:09,711 --> 02:14:11,336
I won't do anything wrong from now on.

2384
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:14,336
Don't punish my sister for my mistake.

2385
02:14:14,795 --> 02:14:18,461
And you misunderstood me.

2386
02:14:18,670 --> 02:14:23,211
Instead of saying Pi Pi Pi, if only
you said that you love Priyanka...

2387
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:28,253
...then everything would have been fine.

2388
02:14:28,336 --> 02:14:34,086
Always giving the lecture.
Stop lecturing and come to a solution.

2389
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:36,420
- The solution has been given by Mr. Raj.
- What?

2390
02:14:36,878 --> 02:14:40,336
Joy would divorce Tina
and marry Priyanka.

2391
02:14:40,670 --> 02:14:42,503
And Tina marry Shaan.

2392
02:14:44,003 --> 02:14:45,753
- Hey Mr. Dhanakrishna?
- Yes.

2393
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:49,878
You are right.

2394
02:14:50,211 --> 02:14:53,378
Nobody can change
whatever is destined.

2395
02:14:53,461 --> 02:14:54,461
That's right.

2396
02:14:54,545 --> 02:14:57,128
All is well that ends well.

2397
02:14:57,211 --> 02:14:59,378
Charan, you are right.

2398
02:14:59,586 --> 02:15:02,503
This is the first time
you've said a correct English.

2399
02:15:09,086 --> 02:15:12,295
Now what?
Don't you have anything to say?

2400
02:15:12,545 --> 02:15:13,920
Yes we have.

2401
02:15:14,336 --> 02:15:17,045
Our father-in laws thought
that their son-in-law's are fraud.

2402
02:15:17,545 --> 02:15:18,920
Are you thinking the same?

2403
02:15:19,528 --> 02:15:26,670
Son-in-law's can never be fraud,
and ours are certainly not.

2404
02:15:27,936 --> 02:15:31,144
"Disguised as Son-In-Law, I have come."

2405
02:15:31,227 --> 02:15:34,394
"I have come, I have come."

2406
02:15:34,926 --> 02:15:38,106
"I have listed the number of gifts
I'll get."

2407
02:15:38,186 --> 02:15:41,394
"I have listed, I have listed."

2408
02:15:41,894 --> 02:15:45,019
"Disguised as Son-In-Law, I have come."

2409
02:15:45,370 --> 02:15:48,561
"I have listed the number of gifts
I'll get."

2410
02:15:48,933 --> 02:15:52,019
"I'll be eating Ilsha, meat and Koi."

2411
02:15:52,356 --> 02:15:55,519
"Making my tummy full
with Sweet Curd."

2412
02:15:55,852 --> 02:15:59,227
"Don't ask me too much,
I'll show you my status."

2413
02:15:59,311 --> 02:16:02,311
"I'm the smartest Son-In Law,
I'm the hit."

2414
02:16:02,394 --> 02:16:05,727
"I'm a hit son-in-law,
can cope up with anybody."

2415
02:16:05,977 --> 02:16:09,352
"Anybody could say
