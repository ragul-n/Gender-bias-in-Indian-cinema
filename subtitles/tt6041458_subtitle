00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,320

39
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,280
Girl preferably...
40

40
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Modern...
41

41
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,160
Very modern...
42

42
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,520
Ultra modern.
43

43
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,800
You are perfectly fit for that.
Very lucky you are.

-It's impressive.
-I know.

48
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,320
Your form?
49

49
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,935
If you break up,
it will come in handy.

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,840
-What's the plan?
-Nothing.

You see a modern girl,
you'll apply for her boyfriend's post!
53

53
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
She has joined only today.
54

54
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,320
Many come from villages
with zillion dreams.
55

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
His dream
is to marry a modern girl.
56

56
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,840
She seems to be committed,
since she was in 7th grade.
57

57
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,600
You should've prepared to woo her,
when you were in kindergarten.
58

58
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,720
So what if I don't have her now.
She breaks up and I'll be there.
59

59
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
Why do you want a modern girl?
60

60
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,040
She'll speak English
without grammar mistakes.
61

61
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
Our kids will also speak English
without grammar mistakes.
62

62
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
-Simple.
-You know what.
63

63
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,080
-You should marry a village belle.
-Me! Marry a village belle!
64

64
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,080
A lion doesn't eat grass,
even if it's starving.
65

65
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
A lion.
66

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,320
The best modern girl of Mumbai
will be my wife...
67

67
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,720
-Or I will die a bachelor.
-Challenge?
68

68
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,960
-Chall...
-Just shut up!
69

69
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,320
I hate you.
70

70
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Don't you ever show me your face again.
71

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
Don't you even dare.
72

72
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,680
I like it.
73

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
Excuse me.
74

74
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
It's me.
75

75
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,440
Dance
76

76
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,560
Mesmerising...
Dressed in a short skirt, yeah.
77

77
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,760
Your shoes click on the floor
when you catwalk, the cars go by.
78

78
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
Let me get a taste of your love.
79

79
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Let's get lovey-dovey
Why be afraid?
80

80
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,360
What a figure!
Bend it like Beckham, baby!
81

81
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,680
Dance
82

82
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,080
I am Krishna, I work my magic
and the love flute plays
83

83
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,040
You will be my queen of my kingdom
84

84
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Flowers bloom all around,
it rains in the desert
85

85
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,040
Say yes and make my day
86

86
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,960
You've stayed single long enough,
you should mingle now
87

87
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,400
Let's get lovey-dovey
Why be afraid?
88

88
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,680
What a figure!
Bend it like Beckham, baby!

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,120
Hey, go. Boys, please.
93

93
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,880
Thank you. You made me realise,
what true love is.
94

94
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,880
He didn't come to pick me up,
so I broke up with him.
95

95
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,640
Who?
96

96
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
Him.
97

97
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Thank you.
98

98
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,360
-Hey, get lost!
-Huh?
99

99
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Go now!
100

100
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,840
Dance.
101

101
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,880
I came to the station to get you.
See how much I love you.
102

102
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,880
That was bad.
103

103
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,480
Are you okay?
104

104
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,360
It's okay. 32.
Let's have a drink.
105

105
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,960
A whole mountain in the city!
106

106
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,960
Get up! You!
107

107
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,840
-Krishna!
-What?
108

108
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,760
Why is your phone switched off?
Your father's been calling me.
109

109
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,180
-Why?
-Your grandma is very ill.
110

110
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,504
You have to go to the village.
111

111
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
Hey! Move!
112

112
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,640
Cows, please, please move.
113

113
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,280
Move!
114

114
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,120
Hey!
115

115
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,080
Hey!
116

116
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,520
Hey!
117

117
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Hey!
118

118
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,400
Hello.
119

119
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,800
Keep the cows off the road.
The road is meant for cars.
120

120
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Stupid village people.
121

121
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,240
Right. Aren't you from this village too?
122

122
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,280
Hey.
123

123
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Dad.
124

124
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,840
The pulse rate is dropping.
Next 48 hours are critical.
125

125
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Sorry.
126

126
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,000
She's alive.
127

127
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,360
So sorry.
128

128
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,240
Grandma is on her deathbed
129

129
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
and they are talking about my marriage.
130

130
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,200
Oh God!
He's thinking about it now.
131

131
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,240
You have to be married in 48 hours.
132

132
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,960
Has your dad
ordered a bride on Flipkart?
133

133
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,440
Do you think I will do it?
134

134
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,280
-So, you're going to go against your dad?
-Yes.
135

135
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,600
Won't you be afraid?
136

136
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,840
Why should I be afraid?
I'll tell him...
137

137
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,240
My marriage, my decision.
138

138
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,800
Okay.
139

139
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
So, is the wedding cancelled?
140

140
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Confirmed.
141

141
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,560
They should ask for your reaction,
not someone who cannot respond.
142

142
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,760
Does your grandma love you?
143

143
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,800
She does.
144

144
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,400
Luck favours you.
145

145
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,640
-Who is she?
-The cow herder.
146

146
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,120
Oh, the cow girl.
147

147
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,200
She'll die tomorrow.
148

148
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
-Krishna, come here.
-What?
149

149
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,240
You're in trouble.
150

150
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm wondering how cow girl
will wake you up every morning.
151

151
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,920
Hey, Krishna...
152

152
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,120
My dream has come to nought.
153

153
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,400
I don't like her at all.
154

154
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,880
What will you do about that?
155

155
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,800
Think of something.
156

156
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,640
What if she rejects you?
157

157
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,320
Forty-three.
158

158
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,120
Ninety...
159

159
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,720
You want to marry me.
Do you know Hindi?
160

160
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,040
If you want to live in Mumbai,
you have to know Hindi.
161

161
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Do you know Hindi?
162

162
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,720
Yes, I know Hindi.
163

163
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,200
My mother is from Uttar Pradesh.
164

164
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,360
We are here because of my father.
165

165
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,120
I speak Hindi better than Tamil.
166

166
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
What a twist!
167

167
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,440
You don't know my brother.
168

168
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,960
You should see how he parties.
169

169
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,760
Whiskey...
170

170
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,040
Cigarettes...
Ladies...
171

171
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,120
If you still want to marry him...
172

172
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,720
It's up to you.
173

173
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,960
Punchline.
174

174
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,200
I am worried for you.
175

175
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,000
You can still refuse to marry him.
176

176
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,280
Oh no! Her mother!
177

177
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,560
This man is a drunkard.
178

178
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,560
He wanted to hit our cows.
179

179
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
You told us that,
when you refused to marry him.
180

180
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,600
But he cares about you.
181

181
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,040
You won't find a better life partner.
182

182
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,280
Alcohol damages the liver...
183

183
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,040
...but he is good at heart.
184

184
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,320
I had told you.
She's a nice girl.
185

185
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,080
I will offer a coconut
at the temple.
186

186
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,520
Hey! Nuisance!
187

187
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,760
She had rejected me,
but your stupid idea spoiled everything.
188

188
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,040
Look, the wedding
can't be cancelled...
189

189
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
-But can be postponed.
-How?
190

190
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,440
If a member of a close-knit family dies,
191

191
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,920
no weddings are held for a year.
192

192
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,080
-Yours is a close-knit family, right?
-Who will die?
193

193
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,280
Your grandmother.
194

194
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,720
She doesn't seem to want to die.
195

195
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
She will die.
196

196
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,840
Hey!
197

197
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,560
God!
198

198
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,840
Who pulled out the oxygen mask?
199

199
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,520
You're so lucky, sir.
200

200
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,040
-Her pulse rate is normal now.
-Really!
201

201
00:19:58,188 --> 00:19:59,918
She'll be up and running in the morning.
202

202
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,080
You are like a goddess.
My mother survived!
203

203
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,800
This marriage will happen.
204

204
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,000
So, Krishna...
205

205
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
Now, what about you?
206

206
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,960
Nothing can stop this wedding now.
207

207
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,920
-Mom.
-Take care.
208

208
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,680
Take care of yourself.
209

209
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,880
Goodbye.
210

210
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,880
Mind-blowing luck, my friend.
There's no escaping this now.
211

211
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
This is what I get for being a friend.
212

212
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Bananas.
213

213
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,680
Come on.
214

214
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,440
Amusing!
That's the India I'm looking for.
215

215
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,520
-Can you pose?
-What? Excuse me.
216

216
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
-What is happening here?
-Sorry.
217

217
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,840
Same t-shirt.
218

218
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,880
-Alright. I should...
-Hey!
219

219
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
What do I do with her?
220

220
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
Take her home.
221

221
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,383
I told my friends I'd marry a modern girl.
222

222
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:02,504
I'll get rid of her.
223

223
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,120
-What! Where will the poor...
-I am the poor one.
224

224
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
What should we do?
225

225
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,000
Find another house to rent.
226

226
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,440
Take them.
227

227
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,520
Returning from your village?
228

228
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,400
She's from a village.
I'm from Germany.
229

229
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,440
Yeah, right.
230

230
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm going to your house.
Find a house soon.
231

231
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Come on.
232

232
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,400
Walk ten steps behind me.
233

233
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,080
Why?
234

234
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
That's how husbands and wives
walk in Mumbai.
235

235
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,080
Wait.
236

236
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,960
-Hello?
-I found a great flat.
237

237
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
15,000 rupees per month.
In Matunga.
238

238
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,040
Fully furnished.
Should I finalise the deal?
239

239
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,240
Okay.
240

240
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,720
Message the address.
241

241
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,920
Advance?
242

242
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,400
-You pay.
-You...
243

243
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,840
Excuse me.
244

244
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,560
Where is Green Gift building?
245

245
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,200
That one there.
246

246
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,520
Go there.
247

247
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,240
-Which flat?
-205.
248

248
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,400
205!
249

249
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,520
Sir, the new tenants.
250

250
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,400
-They are a married couple.
-Hello.
251

251
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,000
1st floor, 205.
252

252
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,720
He has told you about the house, right?
253

253
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,000
-Yes, I told them. Okay, sir.
-Okay.
254

254
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,680
No lift?
255

255
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,880
Sir, please give me the key.
256

256
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,280
Sir, this is the flat.
257

257
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,360
Hello.
258

258
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,080
What is this?
259

259
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,440
You took the rent in advance.
You should've cleaned it at least.
260

260
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,440
You got such a huge flat
for that amount.
261

261
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,600
Be happy, sir.
262

262
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,160
-Here.
-Thank you, sir.
263

263
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,200
Okay.
264

264
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,920
I'll get some food. Stay here.
265

265
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
-It's our house. Come in.
-What?
266

266
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,920
Of course, you are here.
267

267
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,600
Who cleaned the house?
268

268
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,840
I did.
269

269
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,240
-On your own?
-Yes.
270

270
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,600
Can't believe it.
271

271
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,720
Don't you require help?
272

272
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,680
There's no need. I'll manage.
273

273
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,840
The food is ready. Eat it.
274

274
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,120
You cooked food?
275

275
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,480
I cooked with what I brought,
from the village.
276

276
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,120
You didn't make kheer?
277

277
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,080
What food is this!
278

278
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,240
-Not fit for humans.
-I won't eat.
279

279
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,160
Yes.
280

280
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
South Indian food in Mumbai!
Sambhar, Rasam, Curd Rice.
281

281
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,640
Oh, come on!
282

282
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,920
If you have to, cook...
283

283
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,920
Cook continental food,
Chinese food, butter chicken...
284

284
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,960
Cook good food.
285

285
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,920
-How do you put up with this?
-Wait!
286

286
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,800
Go back to the village
and learn how to cook those dishes.
287

287
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,840
Take your time. Go.
288

288
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,120
Manchurian!
289

289
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,960
Bread.
290

290
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Why didn't you bring this earlier?
291

291
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Did you want to eat it alone?
292

292
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,920
We won't eat...
293

293
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
Mind-blowing! Try it!
294

294
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,480
Which flat?
295

295
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Hi.
296

296
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,680
205.
297

297
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,360
Bachelor.
298

298
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,680
Bachelor.
299

299
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Krishna.
300

300
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm single now.
301

301
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,920
Krishna!
302

302
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,000
Grandma!
303

303
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
What happened? Krishna!
304

304
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,600
Krishna! Get up!
305

305
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,320
-Grandma!
-Help him up.
306

306
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,040
What's wrong? Get up. Krishna.
307

307
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,800
Grandma!
308

308
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
What?
309

309
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,440
Too late.
310

310
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,320
-Are these fresh?
-Yes.
311

311
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,360
-Are you new to the area?
-Yes.
312

312
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,480
-Which flat?
-205.
313

313
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,200
-I live with my husband.
-Madagascar.
314

314
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,560
No manners.
315

315
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,040
How much for the cabbage?
316

316
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Hello!
317

317
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah, Krishna here.
318

318
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,120
Gurpreet. Take an extra pass.
319

319
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,440
Hey, take your passes.
320

320
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,880
-Thank you.
-Krishna, your passes.
321

321
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,880
-I don't want them.
-Have you lost it?
322

322
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,920
Our company
is sponsoring film awards.
323

323
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,920
We will get to see the film stars
up close and personal.
324

324
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,240
There'll be an after party too.
Models, actresses...
325

325
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,040
They speak in English,
without grammar mistakes.
326

326
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,800
Once you get on the dance floor...
327

327
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,320
-You're sure to impress one at least.
-No.
328

328
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,480
I'm not in the mood.
329

329
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
Don't worry.
You'll find a modern girl.
330

330
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,106
You didn't just shift out of the house,
you've changed.
331

331
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,360
You're coming to the show.
332

332
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,680
Superstar Raj Khanna will be there.
333

333
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,640
People are crazy about him.
334

334
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,200
Did you hear his new song?
335

335
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,440
Great music! Great song too!
336

336
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,240
Pop some champagne
Go crazy
337

337
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,560
Forget everything tonight
338

338
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,040
Dance the bhangra
Go to a disco
339

339
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,440
Set the floor on fire
340

340
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,120
Your eyes are mesmerising
341

341
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Your eyes are mesmerising
342

342
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,800
You're the one
who stole my heart
343

343
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,880
You're the one
who stole my heart
344

344
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,440
My beloved, my darling
345

345
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,840
Give me a chance
346

346
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,240
Come to me, my darling
347

347
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,600
Let us romance
348

348
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,200
I love the way you dance
349

349
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,120
Dance, dance, dance, dance
350

350
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,520
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance
351

351
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,160
I love the way you dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
352

352
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,880
Dance, dance, dance, dance
353

353
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,800
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance
354

354
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,480
I will flex my muscles
355

355
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,360
and beat up those who look at you
My six-pack abs I will gift wrap
356

356
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,360
and gift them to you
on Valentine's Day
357

357
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,760
You'll never see one like me,
all over the world
358

358
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,720
I am a Punjabi...
359

359
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,160
Straight away from Moga
360

360
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,520
Chin, chin, chin,
listen to me, ma'am
361

361
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,920
Chin, chin, chin,
why do you torture me?
362

362
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,400
Chin, chin, chin,
O, shake your bum
363

363
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,800
Have mercy on the men
that love you
364

364
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,520
Dance, dance, dance, dance
365

365
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,760
Dance, dance, dance, dance
I love the way you dance
366

366
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,640
Dance, dance, dance, dance
367

367
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,360
Dance, dance, dance, dance
368

368
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,200
Dance, dance, dance, dance
369

369
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,640
Coffee.
370

370
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,480
What is this?
371

371
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,280
My company is sponsoring an awards show.
Passes to the show.
372

372
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,160
May I go with you?
373

373
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,800
It was the first time
you asked for something,
374

374
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,400
that is why I agreed.
375

375
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,760
Listen carefully.
376

376
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
At the venue, we won't be together.
377

377
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,720
We'll sit separately.
378

378
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,200
After the function,
379

379
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,880
you'll go to the ladies toilet,
I'll go to the gents toilet.
380

380
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,720
After everyone leaves,
we'll go home. Okay?
381

381
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,080
Not one question.
382

382
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,960
This is good.
383

383
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,960
That was later.
384

384
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,560
He had chicken-pox at this age.
385

385
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,040
Here.
386

386
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,440
Such a cartoon!
387

387
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,760
Krishna.
388

388
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,680
You said you wouldn't be here.
389

389
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,280
Moving on to the next category...
390

390
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,160
Nominations for Best Director
for Truedeal Awards 2016 are...
391

391
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,680
What...
392

392
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,880
Where is she sitting?
393

393
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,960
Thank you.
394

394
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,920
I didn't make this film alone.
395

395
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,000
Raj supported me a lot.
396

396
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
He's like my brother.
Thank you, Raj.
397

397
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,040
What an award...
398

398
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,840
Place where hard work...
399

399
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,080
The girl sitting next to you is gorgeous.
400

400
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,160
Seems like a village girl,
and is here alone.
401

401
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,720
-Best Film of the year...
-Exchange seats with me.
402

402
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,400
-You're not interested, let me...
-Hey!
403

403
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,880
Just because she's alone,
you'll behave like this?
404

404
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,200
Stop it. Respect women.
405

405
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
It could be your friend's wife.
406

406
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,360
Could we have on stage,
the chairman of Truedeal...
407

407
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,760
He's not interested,
he won't let us enjoy either.
408

408
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,680
And the Best Actor goes to...
Raj Khanna...
409

409
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,560
For Revolver Raja 002.
410

410
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,640
Everyone has dreams.
411

411
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,600
But dreams come true for those,
who work to realise their dreams.
412

412
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,360
I was one in a crowd,
then one in thousands...
413

413
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,960
And today...
414

414
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,960
I am one in a million.
415

415
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,480
-Super, sir.
-So, go for your dreams...
416

416
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,520
No matter what.
417

417
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,800
In life,
play your role with dedication.
418

418
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,080
Even after the curtain falls
419

419
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,780
...the applause will continue.
420

420
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,040
Come on.
421

421
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,400
Raj Khanna...
I've seen all his movies.
422

422
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm a huge fan.
423

423
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,560
-What are you doing here?
-Just hanging out.
424

424
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,120
Let's go to the party.
425

425
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,440
I'm tired. I'll go home.
426

426
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,164
Are you crazy? You're refusing to...
427

427
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:39,624
-Go for the party?
-Don't insist!
428

428
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,880
I told you I'm tired.
429

429
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,440
-What's with him?
-Yes.
430

430
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,040
Where is she going?
431

431
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,520
To the after-party!
432

432
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,800
-You took that seriously, right?
-Yes.
433

433
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,080
-Just for gags. Come on.
-You're too much.
434

434
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,160
Lift!
435

435
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,760
Oh gosh!
436

436
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,600
My wife!
437

437
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,160
Hey ya

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,080
Dance like this...

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,720

I'm in Bollywood
My story is unique
443

443
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,000
My youth entices one and all
444

444
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,360
Shake it
445

445
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,280

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Who is she?
449

449
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,960
Don't know, sir.
450

450
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,320
Yeah
451

451
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,140
Yeah

452
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,360
Yeah

Money, money, money, money

I am popular everywhere I go
455

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,120
My beauty is magical
456

456
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,080
I am like a shining star
457

457
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,480
Stay around and clap your hands
458

458
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,440
Dance like this
459

459

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Check it out, yo

Rhythm on the bass, man
462

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,800
Jump it up

Yes

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
What... Oh no...
469

469
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,640
What?
470

470
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,680
What did you do to me?
471

471
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,760
What! You're asking me!
472

472
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,760
My sari is torn.
473

473
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,560
I thought you were a decent man.
474

474
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,480
You... Your sari... You think I...
475

475
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,240
Then what? Where did you take me?
What did you give me?
476

476
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
I have a headache.
477

477
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Forget that.
478

478
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,200
Come on.
479

479
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,680
No.
480

480
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,720
I'll bathe first,
and recite Gayatri Mantra ten times.
481

481
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,520
Only then will I start the day.
482

482
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,240
Hey! Right.
483

483
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,480
Ramu, call ma'am here.
484

484
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,800
Ramu! Excuse me.
Who is the ma'am?
485

485
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,320
I am Mr. Raj Khanna's manager.
486

486
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Sir has sent me here.
487

487
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,200
Call ma'am here.
488

488
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,440
There's no ma'am here. Please go.
489

489
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,880
Hey, ma'am...
490

490
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,280
Ma'am.
491

491
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,760
The industry is talking about ma'am
and you...
492

492
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,920
-Call her here.
-Wrong address.
493

493
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,520
There's just a 'sir' here,
no 'ma'am'.
494

494
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,520
Okay? Please.
495

495
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,320
Last night, ma'am took a taxi
from the hotel and came here.
496

496
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,215
Had a hard time convincing,
the taxi driver for the address
497

497
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,520
and you say she isn't here.
498

498
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,920
Call her out.
499

499
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
I told you she's not here.
500

500
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,600
If she's here, where is she?
501

501
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,160
I am here.
502

502
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,200
Ma'am.
503

503
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,160
I am fortunate indeed.
504

504
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,800
What a performance it was!
505

505
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,320
What a smile!
506

506
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,840
You dance so well, so graceful.
507

507
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,440
I have two groups for you,
on WhatsApp.
508

508
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,680
Future Sridevi,
Future Madhuri Dixit.
509

509
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,200
Everyone in the industry
wants to sign you for a film,
510

510
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,640
but who got here first?
511

511
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,680
-Dilip Kukreja, star secretary.
-Excuse me.
512

512
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,040
Stop this nonsense!
513

513
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,240
-Come out.
-Shut up! Get lost!
514

514
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,030
Who is this mad man?
515

515
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:20,575
We're talking and he's interrupting us.
516

516
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,440
-He is...
-Hey, mister!
517

517
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,440
My manager.
518

518
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
What!
519

519
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,560
Manager!
520

520
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,264
Manager! You appointed
one already!
521

521
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,160
Superb, ma'am. Very good, ma'am.
522

522
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,200
-I...
-Hey, Get up.
523

523
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Get up, I say.
524

524
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,600
Can't you show some respect?
525

525
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,960
Mad fellow.
526

526
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,000
Ma'am, Mr. Khanna has decided,
527

527
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,215
in fact he insists that you...
528

528
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,700
Will be the lead actress
in his next film.
529

529
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:42,544
Actress!
530

530
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
-Yes.
-Leave!
531

531
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,920
Sir has said...
532

532
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,640
...that if you refuse to do the film,
he won't act in it.
533

533
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,080
Please, ma'am.
Okay, ma'am?
534

534
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,880
I'll think about it.
535

535
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,520
Super, ma'am. That is enough.
536

536
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,680
I'll call Mr. Khanna and tell him.
537

537
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,200
Hello, sir. Ma'am has agreed.
538

538
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,840
We'll have her sign on Friday
and start shooting immediately.
539

539
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,680
You speak to her.
Hold on.
540

540
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,480
Ma'am, Mr. Raj Khanna.
541

541
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,720
-Hello?
-Hi.
542

542
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,280
I saw you at the award function
last night.
543

543
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,920
It was proved...
544

544
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,280
...that stars are meant to shine bright,
545

545
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,280
and are visible to the world.
546

546
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,800
Welcome to the world of dreams.
547

547
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,480
-You're lucky.
-You too.
548

548
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,960
See you on the sets.
549

549
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,920
Thank you, ma'am.
550

550
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,720
What is your problem?
551

551
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,840
You're sitting on a gold mine
and are behaving stupid.
552

552
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,720
Listen carefully.
553

553
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,360
I will take care of ma'am's dates,
agreements and finances.
554

554
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,920
You just act like her manager.
555

555
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
I will give you 5% of the earnings
as commission.
556

556
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,480
Commission?
557

557
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,880
You'll give it to me! Hey...
558

558
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,480
-What?
-You want a share in the profits?
559

559
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,880
I'll send a car here on Friday.
Bring ma'am to the location.
560

560
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,440
I'll manage the rest.
561

561
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,880
The producer, Sharma...
562

562
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,640
He'll find the address
and come here to sign ma'am for a film.
563

563
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,400
-What!
-If he comes here...
564

564
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,480
Like you told me, no one lives here,
bachelors share this house.
565

565
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,320
Tell him that with confidence.
566

566
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,640
He's foolish. He'll believe you.
567

567
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,960
The car will be here at 10
on Friday.
568

568
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,400
Who were you talking to?
569

569
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,760
What?
570

570
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,160
You haven't had a bath yet?
571

571
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,340
What?
572

572
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,600
Have a bath
and recite the Gayatri Mantra five times.
573

573
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,880
Alright?
574

574
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,700
Hey!
575

575
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,840
What do you think?
576

576
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,960
Are you fooling me?
577

577
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,320
You dance.
578

578
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,000
You wear skimpy clothes.
579

579
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,800
You speak in English.
580

580
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,200
You change every minute.
581

581
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,280
Why are you doing this?
582

582
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,520
What is the plan?
583

583
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,320
Are you an undercover cop?
584

584
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,680
Say something.
585

585
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,880
-I understand.
-What do you understand?
586

586
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,920
You don't like me.
587

587
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,000
She is...
588

588
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,160
Don't walk close to me.
Don't sit with me.
589

589
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,280
I thought things would change.
590

590
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,680
You want to throw me out of the house
by accusing me of all this.
591

591
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,680
Hey! Me!
592

592
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,200
Don't take the trouble. I'll go.
593

593
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,640
You be happy.
594

594
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,920
Excuse me.
Why are you calling your father?
595

595
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,360
Not my father,
I'm calling your father.
596

596
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,720
What did I say to you?
597

597
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,840
This is normal in a family.
598

598
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
Cook food.
599

599
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,720
Go.
600

600
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,240
Cook some food.
601

601
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,720
What?
602

602
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,366
You don't want me to go to the village?
603

603
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,600
No.
604

604
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,280
Not now.
605

605
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,720
Hello, sir.
606

606
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,160
When I asked you the address,
607

607
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,575
seemed like you wanted to say something
about Flat 205.
608

608
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,280
Sir, you rented the house
without inquiring about it.
609

609
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,320
What?
610

610
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,320
A girl named Ruby lived there.
She was a model.
611

611
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,600
She wanted to be an actress.
612

612
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,520
It's not easy in Mumbai.
613

613
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,880
She was a nice girl.
614

614
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,480
She stayed aloof.
615

615
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,140
She suffered from depression,
I think.
616

616
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,480
She committed suicide.
617

617
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,000
The police was here.
A case was registered.
618

618
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,200
The house was locked till you rented it.
619

619
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,040
What did you hear?
620

620
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,600
Ghost stories.
621

621
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,480
Why?
622

622
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,960
Those are just stories.
623

623
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,120
There are no ghosts.
624

624
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Tinkling of anklets...
A touch...
625

625
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,280
It's not true.
You are educated.
626

626
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,600
Don't believe all this.
627

627
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,360
Devi!
628

628
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,000
What are you doing there?
629

629
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,680
Watch the TV in the house.
630

630
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,440
Devi.
631

631
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,920
I'm talking to you.
632

632
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,560
Devi.
633

633
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,280
Devi.
634

634
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,440
De...
635

635
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,680
Ruby.
636

636
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,600
What happened?
637

637
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,720
A dream.
638

638
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,981
Don't you have to go to office?
639

639
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,800
Get ready. I'll bring coffee.
640

640
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,960
Ruby.
641

641
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,880
Ru...
642

642
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,000
Our Father in heaven.
643

643
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,360
Holy is Your name.
Our Father in heaven.
644

644
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,080
Who is Ruby?
645

645
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,160
A colleague is getting married.
646

646
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,440
Should I give him gold or a ruby?
647

647
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,560
Let's go.
648

648
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,280
-Where?
-Picnic.
649

649
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,880
A Mumbai tour.
650

650
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,960
Why?
651

651
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,960
Surprise.
652

652
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,600
-Yes.
-For how many days?
653

653
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
4-5 days.
654

654
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,160
Pack everything.
655

655
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,720
So many things for 4-5 days?
656

656
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,120
Will you get ready now?
657

657
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,160
You won't understand.
658

658
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,540
Please.
659

659
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,440
Are you here?
660

660
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,640
Yes, that's the address.
661

661
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,600
I'm coming.
662

662
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,880
Are you ready?
663

663
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,360
I'm coming.
664

664
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,320
-The boot...
-I'll keep it.
665

665
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,960
Devi!
666

666
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,040
Devi!
667

667
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,040
Devi!
668

668
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,320
The bags are back on the cupboard.
669

669
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,440
What's wrong?
You didn't go to work?
670

670
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,520
You changed?
671

671
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,720
You were getting ready,
weren't you?
672

672
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,920
Why? Where are we going?
673

673
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,520
For a holiday.
674

674
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,760
Oh! For how many days?
675

675
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,640
Huh!
676

676
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,000
Many days.
677

677
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,880
Should I pack everything?
678

678
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,040
Yes.
679

679
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,320
Please...
680

680
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,560
Yes.
681

681
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
And...
682

682
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,760
That one too.
683

683
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,760
Hurry up.
684

684
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,920
-The luggage...
-Let's go.
685

685
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,840
Careful.
686

686
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,000
Stay here. I'll be back.
687

687
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,080
Did anyone
take the luggage upstairs?
688

688
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,160
No, sir.
689

689
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,120
What happened?
690

690
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,000
You didn't go to work?
691

691
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,000
Listen...
692

692
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,320
No, no.
693

693
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,400
Sir...
694

694
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,560
Ma'am...
695

695
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,600
Sir, I... Ghost...
696

696
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,040
Sir.
697

697
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,400
Sir.
698

698
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,320
Sir!
699

699
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,360
Sir, please.
700

700
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,200
Sir! Sir!
701

701
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,320
Sir!
702

702
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,680
In my own house.
703

703
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,440
How...
704

704
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,760
Are you ready?
705

705
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,600
Coffee.
706

706
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,600
Take it.
707

707
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
What is this?
708

708
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,880
He's the one.
709

709
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
My wife.
710

710
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,240
Who are they?
711

711
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,560
They are here to conduct a prayer ritual.
712

712
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,440
These people perform prayer rituals!
713

713
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,880
If we'd told father,
he would've sent a priest.
714

714
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,360
-There was no time. Get coffee.
-Cof...
715

715
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
Sir...
716

716
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,640
Has the ghost left?
717

717
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,800
Huh?
718

718
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,520
It has gone.
719

719
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,840
It won't come back, will it?
720

720
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,480
Test.
721

721
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,440
What?
722

722
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,720
Ruby.
723

723
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,800
Ruby.
724

724
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,120
Why are you calling the ghost back?
725

725
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,520
Sorry.
726

726
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,800
Dance, dance, dance, dance
I love the way you dance
727

727
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,880
Dance, dance, dance, dance
728

728
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,640
Dance, dance, dance, dance
729

729
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,560
I love the way you dance
730

730
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,560
Dance, dance, dance, dance
731

731
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,000
Dance, dance, dance, dance
732

732
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,480
I love the way you dance
733

733
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,240
Dance, dance, dance, dance
734

734
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,240
Dance, dance, dance, dance
735

735
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,840
I love the way you dance
736

736
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,640
Help!
737

737
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,320
This is my house.
738

738
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,400
You came here without my permission...
739

739
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,040
...but you cannot leave now.
740

740
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,760
What do you want?
741

741
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,640
Why have you possessed Devi?
742

742
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,120
I was a struggling actress.
743

743
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,160
After years of struggle,
744

744
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,440
I got a chance
to act with Raj Khanna.
745

745
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,360
It would've been the debut film
for both of us.
746

746
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,080
But I was thrown out of the film.
747

747
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,520
If I had acted in that film,
748

748
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,720
I too, would've been a star
like Raj Khanna.
749

749
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,760
Anger, frustration, depression.
750

750
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,960
One wrong decision...
751

751
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,640
...all my dreams were shattered.
752

752
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,760
God has given me an opportunity,
through Devi,
753

753
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,480
to show the world who Ruby is.
754

754
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,920
No one can stop me,
from acting in the film.
755

755
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,040
If anyone tries to,
756

756
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,160
I will ruin that person's life.
757

757
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,160
Devi!
758

758
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,440
Movie!
759

759
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,760
I won't accept that.
760

760
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,840
I didn't ask for your permission,
761

761
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,440
I stated my decision.
762

762
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,440
I won't disturb Devi in the house.
763

763
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,320
You cannot disturb Ruby
outside the house.
764

764
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,880
Tomorrow at 10 am, Raj Khanna
will send a car to pick me up.
765

765
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,160
It's your responsibility
to take Devi out of the house.
766

766
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,120
Me!
767

767
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,360
You're my manager, after all.
768

768
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,640
What's wrong?
769

769
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,920
You haven't slept yet?
770

770
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,240
Want something to eat?
771

771
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,600
What?
772

772
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,960
Who are you now?
773

773
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,040
What are you saying?
774

774
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
It's late.
775

775
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,120
Go to sleep.
776

776
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,680
What's wrong?
777

777
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,920
You are pacing about.
778

778
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,194
-Don't you have to go to office?
-No, ma'am.
779

779
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,040
I have cooked only for myself.
780

780
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,680
-If I knew...
-Krishna!
781

781
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,160
It's 10!
782

782
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,120
Will you take Devi out or should I?
783

783
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,040
I can make okra, but you don't like it,
so I can cook something else.
784

784
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,920
-Nothing.
-What?
785

785
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,600
-Where?
-Picnic.
786

786
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,080
You always say we'll go,
but we never go.
787

787
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,080
Let me take my clothes.
Wait. Listen.
788

788
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,880
Get a reason to live
789

789
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,920
Make life colourful
790

790
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,320
Soar high in the sky
791

791
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,320
Enjoy every moment
792

792
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,240
Don't stop
793

793
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:04,880
Live life to the fullest
794

794
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,000
She's not an actress. She's my wife.
She's possessed by a spirit.
795

795
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,040
Listen...
796

796
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,040
She's not an actress.
She's my wife.
797

797
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,880
-She's possessed by a spirit.
-Please drive faster.
798

798
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,920
Yes, ma'am!
799

799
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,720
He can't hear me.
800

800
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,280
She must've done something.
801

801
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,760
Colour, beauty...
802

802
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,720
Colour, beauty...
803

803
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:47,360
This world is beautiful
804

804
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,960
I want to rule the world
805

805
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,600
There's beauty all around
806

806
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,120
-Let me admire the beauty.
-Welcome.
807

807
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,680
Get a reason to live
808

808
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,640
Make life colourful
809

809
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,640
So, ladies and gentlemen...
810

810
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,280
Here is the lead actress
of Revolver Raja 3, Ruby Singh.
811

811
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,280
We should've signed her for our film.
812

812
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,720
We missed it.
813

813
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,880
Wow!
814

814
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,200
-She's gorgeous.
-Who?
815

815
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,800
The actress.
She's the next superstar.
816

816
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,800
She's not an actress.
817

817
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,680
She's my wife.
818

818
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,120
She's possessed by a spirit.
819

819
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,360
You can't hear me, can you?
820

820
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,960
Not Hema Malini, Sridevi.
821

821
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,200
Lights!
822

822
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,080
First shot!
823

823
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,200
All in.
824

824
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,960
It's Lady Luck.
825

825
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,080
A beautiful woman wins hearts.
826

826
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,080
An intelligent woman wins accolades.
827

827
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,040
A woman who has beauty and brains...
828

828
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,000
Wins the world.
829

829
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,000
Cut it!
830

830
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,640
Superb, sir! Superb!
831

831
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,480
You're a star.
832

832
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,600
I know.
833

833
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,200
Born star.
834

834
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,200
Reborn star.
835

835
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,000
Sir...
836

836
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,480
What a pair!
Super hit. Mind-blowing.
837

837
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,000
I already have the feeling
that the film will be a super duper hit.
838

838
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,120
Hail Goddess!
839

839
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,520
-Hail Goddess!
-Dilip.
840

840
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,600
Yes?
841

841
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,880
The film industry
is a dazzling world.
842

842
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,880
Yes, sir.
843

843
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,400
The lights you see here...
844

844
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,840
There's darkness behind them.
845

845
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,840
The journey from the darkness
into the light...
846

846
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,160
...is a short journey.
847

847
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,800
But often this short journey
takes years to complete.
848

848
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,160
It took me 14 years.
849

849
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,600
Many a time,
it may take a lifetime.
850

850
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,320
What a profound thought!
851

851
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,240
A lifetime.
You're right, sir.
852

852
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,280
I have always rejected offers
to act in romantic films.
853

853
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:48,960
But...
854

854
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,120
For the first time,
I didn't want the scene to end.
855

855
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,440
I know what you mean.
856

856
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,800
Hail Goddess!
You're a rockstar, sir.
857

857
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,160
I'll be back.
858

858
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,600
Krishna!
859

859
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,200
It's done, right?
Where's ma'am?
860

860
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,920
-We have to go.
-Krishna, wait.
861

861
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,840
It's not done.
The good times...
862

862
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,920
-Have just begun.
-What?
863

863
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:18,240
I will get film offers.
Ma'am will sign them and you'll enjoy.
864

864
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,224
-Sign!
-Mr. Khanna wants ma'am...
865

865
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:22,304
To sign a three-film contract.
866

866
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,760
Three! You had said one film.
867

867
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,400
I won't accept the three-film offer.
868

868
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,160
Sorry, sir.
I feel very sorry for you.
869

869
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,560
Who are you to refuse?
Are you her husband?
870

870
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,480
Mr. Khanna has spoken to Ms. Singh.
871

871
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,545
Take the contract
and get it back
872

872
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:35,820
tomorrow,
after she has signed it.
873

873
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,960
Go!
874

874
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,360
-Contract!
-Go!
875

875
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,840
Stupid man!
876

876
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,360
She agreed to a contract!
877

877
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,160
Taxi!
878

878
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,400
2 minutes.
879

879
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,920
-Come on.
-But...
880

880
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,240
Fast.
881

881
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,800
Go.
882

882
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,800
Hey!
883

883
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,680
Hey!
884

884
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,720
Hello, Miss Ruby Singh.
885

885
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,000
How dare...
886

886
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,120
The manager said you agreed,
to a three-film contract.
887

887
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,800
Don't sign this contract...
888

888
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,200
The key...
889

889
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,480
What contract?
890

890
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,080
Nothing.
891

891
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,120
My manager asked me
892

892
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,080
to sign a two-year contract.
893

893
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,440
I don't know if I should.
894

894
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,720
Where did we go?
895

895
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,480
To the park, the beach...
896

896
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,680
We did?
897

897
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,800
I don't remember anything.
898

898
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,320
Where we went, what we did...
899

899
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,000
How can I not remember anything?
900

900
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,160
I told you...
901

901
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,160
I don't understand.
902

902
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,680
-I want ghosts.
-What?
903

903
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,120
I want food.
904

904
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,840
Didn't you eat anything?
905

905
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,680
No. Please cook some food.
906

906
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,400
Give me 10 minutes.
I'll cook something.
907

907
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,840
Sign it.
908

908
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:57,880
What is it?
909

909
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,680
Contract.
910

910
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,520
I, Ruby the ghost,
911

911
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,720
will not possess Devi's body
after this film.
912

912
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
What the hell!
913

913
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,640
I won't possess Devi's body ever again,
whatever the circumstances.
914

914
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,760
What kind of a contract is this!
915

915
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,400
My contract.
916

916
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,480
Point number three.
917

917
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,760
I, Ruby the ghost, accept that
918

918
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,960
I won't do any intimate scenes
with Raj Khanna
919

919
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,200
or rape scenes with the villain.
920

920
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,880
Strictly no.
921

921
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,320
Point number 4...
922

922
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,360
No smoking. No drinking.
923

923
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,200
Point number 5...
924

924
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,840
I won't use any super powers.
925

925
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,320
And...
926

926
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,760
-What?
-Especially...
927

927
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,040
On the gentleman Krishna.
928

928
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,120
Swear by God and sign it,
Ruby, the ghost.
929

929
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,640
-Have you gone mad?
-A little.
930

930
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,720
An actress has to do all that.
931

931
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,920
You are an actress,
but the body is Devi's.
932

932
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,440
You want a ghost to sign a contract?
933

933
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,240
The ghost wants to act, right?
934

934
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,080
I won't sign it.
935

935
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,160
I won't accept.
936

936
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,320
Hey!
937

937
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,680
Are you not afraid anymore?
938

938
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,880
Do you and Devi
want to live peacefully or not?
939

939
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,320
This is the last day then.
940

940
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,320
Devi won't leave the house
from tomorrow.
941

941
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,680
You said you wouldn't possess Devi
in the house.
942

942
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,080
If you want Devi
to leave the house,
943

943
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,480
you have to sign the contract.
944

944
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,080
Sign it.
945

945
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,440
I am.
946

946
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,360
Lazy ghost.
947

947
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,440
There's a problem.
948

948
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,400
Ruby refuses to sign the three-film
contract.
949

949
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,360
Good.
950

950
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,280
Yes, sir.
951

951
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,880
Even I thought that face...
And three films...
952

952
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,040
I thought you were...
953

953
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,800
Tell the director
to wrap up the film quickly.
954

954
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,760
Yes, sir. We'll send her packing.
955

955
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,560
Ruby won't act in films
after marriage.
956

956
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,040
What?
957

957
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,880
Super decision.
958

958
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,440
Super pairing, sir.
959

959
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,920
Both of you
will look great together.
960

960
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,000
Congratulations, sir.
I'm so happy.
961

961
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,800
Rockstar.
962

962
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,680
Ready.
963

963
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,120
1 2 3 4
964

964
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,680
-Wow!
-Hey!
965

965
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,600
Excuse me.
966

966
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,560
Hello, Baby Rajinikanth.
967

967
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,240
-Who are you?
-Heroine's manager.
968

968
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,880
You're the manager,
not the heroine, right?
969

969
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,240
What are you doing here?
970

970
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,480
You know what this is.
971

971
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,280
Dance is a form of worship.
972

972
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,760
Dancing is an art.
973

973
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,200
Do you know the ABCD of dance?
974

974
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,160
Do you know how to dance?
Get out of here.
975

975
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,160
It's bad.
976

976
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,120
It's dangerous.
977

977
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,680
Michael Jackson's ghost!
978

978
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,440
Here's another ghost.
979

979
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,640
This is an indoor shoot.
Close the umbrella.
980

980
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,640
Rehearsals?
981

981
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,800
No rehearsals.
982

982
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,000
Let's take.
983

983
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,280
Steps?
984

984
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,240
Hit step, Farah.
985

985
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,200
This one again?
986

986
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,800
Evergreen, Farah, evergreen.
987

987
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,400
He knows just this step.
988

988
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,280
-Energy, guys, energy.
-Mind-blowing.
989

989
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,920
Ready? Taking!
990

990
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,480
Are there children in the film?
991

991
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,040
No.
992

992
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,560
Why are there children's clothes here?
993

993
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,400
-These are the heroine's clothes.
-Heroine... Look...
994

994
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,760
Are you kidding me?
What is all this?
995

995
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,960
She should be covered from top to bottom.
996

996
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,200
Be careful, I say.
997

997
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,400
Yes.
998

998
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,320
There is no top or bottom.
999

999
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,520
Ma'am asked you to stay out of here.
1000

1000
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,720
Go.
1001

1001
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:17,840
Darn it!
1002

1002
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,480
Rehearsals!
1003

1003
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,480
Look, look.
1004

1004
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,680
Don't look.
1005

1005
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,640
Why?
1006

1006
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,480
How dare you object!
1007

1007
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,760
She looks se... In a modern dress.
1008

1008
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,400
She looks beautiful.
1009

1009
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,200
She is a beauty queen.
1010

1010
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,783
Lucky is the man who will marry her,
but it's pointless.
1011

1011
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,632
He won't allow her to dress like this.
1012

1012
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,760
Beauty should be appreciated.
1013

1013
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,360
One by one.
1014

1014
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,440
He won't understand.
1015

1015
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,600
Action!
1016

1016
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,800
Tutak tutak

The dancing won't stop,
it will continue from 9 to 4
1021

1021
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,600
Increase the volume,
let's rock the floor
1022

1022
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,240
The dancing won't stop,
it will continue from 9 to 4
1023

1023
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:23,040
Increase the volume,
let's rock the floor

Baby likes to use Instagram
1029

1029
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:46,120
Going to the gym
has made me lean
1030

1030
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,880
Baby uses beauty cream
1031

1031
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,440
I am a selfie queen
1032

1032

Tutak tutak tutiya
1033

1033
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,920
We go to the club every night
1034

1034
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,400
We catch butterflies online
1035

1035
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,040
We're single, ready to mingle.
Look into my eyes

Tutak tutak tutak tutiya

Your hair is black,

Your hair is black,
the hair ornament is red
1042

1042
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,560
You are a beauty queen
1043

1043
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,200
You are a beauty queen
You should be careful
1044

1044
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,160
Your hair is black
It's black

Let's dance
1046

O mister,
1047

1047
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,880
you find anyone better than me
1048

Going to the gym

-Tutak.
-Get out!
1061

1061
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,720
Get out of here.
1062

1062
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,480
Pack up.
1063

1063
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,560
Pack up. Out.
1064

1064
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,680
Krishna.
1065

1065
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,695
Mr. Khanna wants to meet you,
in his office.
1066

1066
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,200
And he expects me to go.
1067

1067
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,080
No way!
1068

1068
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,200
Hey, Krishna. Come.
1069

1069
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,537
Come here.
1070

1070
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,560
Sit.
1071

1071
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,600
Yes, sir.
1072

1072
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,920
Come here.
1073

1073
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,200
Sit.
1074

1074
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,000
I want to tell you something.
1075

1075
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,280
What?
1076

1076
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,040
Raj Khanna, action star.
1077

1077
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,960
All that is okay, but...
1078

1078
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,320
-Love, girl...
-Not right, sir.
1079

1079
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,920
-I am human too.
-Really?
1080

1080
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,240
Superstar.
1081

1081
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,000
I've had this problem
since I was in school.
1082

1082
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,840
Any girl I liked,
I would write a letter to her,
1083

1083
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,280
but never mustered the courage to give it.
1084

1084
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,840
I wrote a letter to Ruby but...
1085

1085
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,880
I couldn't give it to her.
1086

1086
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,600
You'll give ma'am a letter!
1087

1087
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,560
-Thank God!
-I won't.
1088

1088
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,640
You will.
1089

1089
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,860
Krishna...
1090

1090
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,300
I won't.
1091

1091
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,634
I've expressed my feelings
in this letter.
1092

1092
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,400
Give her this letter
and tell her that I love her.
1093

1093
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,840
Enough is enough, Mr. Khanna.
1094

1094
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,600
Take that.
1095

1095
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,200
Do you work out that much?
1096

1096
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,480
I'm counting on you.
1097

1097
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,700
Mr. Khanna.
1098

1098
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,320
And...
1099

1099
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,480
Don't tell anyone.
1100

1100
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,280
Thank you.
1101

1101
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:29,940
Devi...
1102

1102
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:30,849
Devi!
1103

1103
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,440
-Devi.
-Devi.
1104

1104
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,340
De...
1105

1105
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,660
Krishna...
1106

1106
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,060
Dad.
1107

1107
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,560
Dad.
1108

1108
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,558
-You brought them here?
-Yes.
1109

1109
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,852
Why do you keep your phone off?
1110

1110
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,040
I called you so many times.
1111

1111
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,760
What's wrong with Devi?
1112

1112
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,120
She walked up the stairs,
without meeting us.
1113

1113
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,680
-She did?
-Yes.
1114

1114
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,120
-She did.
-Yes.
1115

1115
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,120
-Why? We've been married for so long.
-Krishna.
1116

1116
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,320
-Krishna.
-You didn't come to meet us even once.
1117

1117
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,600
On the first floor. Take your time.
1118

1118
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:04,920
What's wrong?
1119

1119
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,200
-Devi.
-Yes?
1120

1120
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,680
-What?
-Your parents and my dad are downstairs.
1121

1121
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,680
You didn't greet them.
They are angry.
1122

1122
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,680
You sleep. I'll attend to them.
1123

1123
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,240
Devi. They...
1124

1124
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,840
-I...
-Take this.
1125

1125
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,040
What is this?
What are you upset about?
1126

1126
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,560
Everyone makes mistakes.
1127

1127
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,240
You are... No.
1128

1128
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,880
Devi, you should...
1129

1129
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
-Hug them.
-Mom.
1130

1130
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,200
Happy family! Very good.
1131

1131
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,560
I'll take that.
1132

1132
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,400
Please come in. Mom.
1133

1133
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:42,840
Take that.
1134

1134
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,760
Let's go.
1135

1135
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,480
In the room.
1136

1136
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,680
I don't know how you did it,
1137

1137
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,240
but for the first time,
you've done something good.
1138

1138
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,320
I swear, it was a mistake.
1139

1139
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,120
-Hello.
-Sir, the car is ready.
1140

1140
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,360
-Ma'am won't come today.
-Why? What's wrong?
1141

1141
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,840
Ma'am is not well and I am mad.
1142

1142
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,240
Go to sleep.
1143

1143
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,240
Sorry. I'll never bathe again.
1144

1144
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,440
Ruby!
1145

1145
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,320
Ruby!
1146

1146
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,760
-Where are you going?
-Raj Khanna is here.
1147

1147
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,000
Raj Khanna!
1148

1148
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,720
I am a huge fan.
1149

1149
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,640
Raj Khanna...
1150

1150
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,360
Come on. Raj Khanna is here.
1151

1151
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,800
Raj Khanna is here.
1152

1152
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,160
-Ruby!
-Raj Khanna.
1153

1153
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,080
-Raj Khanna.
-Do you know where Ruby lives?
1154

1154
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,920
Listen...
1155

1155
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,440
Excuse me.
1156

1156
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,420
Does anyone know,
where the actress Ruby lives?
1157

1157
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,280
-I have come here...
-Raj Khanna.
1158

1158
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:19,920
Ruby...
1159

1159
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,240
Devi, come here quickly.
1160

1160
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,760
Okay, but I am here...
1161

1161
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,640
Mom, it's Raj Khanna!
1162

1162
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,400
-Ruby's house is here.
-Sir, what are you doing?
1163

1163
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,480
Sir, look over there.
1164

1164
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,040
Autograph please.
1165

1165
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,760
The crowd is getting rowdy.
Let's go.
1166

1166
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,960
Sir, please. Let's go.
1167

1167
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,000
Are you alright?
-Yes.
1168

1168
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,480
Please come.
-Raj Khanna.
1169

1169
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,760
Let's go, sir.
1170

1170
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,000
Let's go.
1171

1171
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,320
Bye.
1172

1172
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,760
He's calling.
1173

1173
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,440
Hello?
1174

1174
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,840
Hello, how is ma'am?
1175

1175
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,360
Fine.
1176

1176
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,440
Give the phone to ma'am.
Sir wants to speak to her.
1177

1177
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,560
She's sleeping.
1178

1178
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,000
You said she was fine.
1179

1179
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,080
Can't a person who is fine not sleep?
1180

1180
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,520
Let her sleep.
1181

1181
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,480
She has to shoot a scene
with sir tomorrow.
1182

1182
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,520
Let her rest.
The car will be there at 9 A.M.
1183

1183
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,400
-Why have you lost weight?
-No.
1184

1184
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,520
I don't go to the gym
and no home food.
1185

1185
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,000
You should come here.
1186

1186
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,880
I can cook for an extra person.
1187

1187
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,080
Devi. Devi.
1188

1188
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,800
-I...
-Listen...
1189

1189
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,240
She's a gem of a person.
1190

1190
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,320
And you don't like her!
1191

1191
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,440
Devi, come here.
1192

1192
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,320
Where?
1193

1193
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,280
Ruby.
1194

1194
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,600
What?
1195

1195
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,360
They want you to shoot tomorrow.
1196

1196
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,520
Our family is here for a week.
1197

1197
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,480
How can I take Devi out...
1198

1198
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,400
Listen...
1199

1199
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,000
You know how it is.
1200

1200
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,880
That is your problem.
1201

1201
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,360
Tomorrow's shoot
is cancelled. Okay?
1202

1202
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,840
That is your problem too.
1203

1203
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,800
They will come here
1204

1204
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,760
and you will have to
deal with that.
1205

1205
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,240
What do I do? You are a ghost.
1206

1206
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,560
Do something to make them go away.
1207

1207
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,320
But that was not a clause
in the contract.
1208

1208
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,920
Good, you're dead.
1209

1209
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,480
Else I would've killed you.
1210

1210
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,640
Hey!
1211

1211
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,240
Friends.
1212

1212
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,480
Please do something.
1213

1213
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,440
Hey, what did you do?
1214

1214
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,840
Who are you?
1215

1215
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,320
What are you looking at?
1216

1216
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,200
Scoot!
1217

1217
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,120
-What's wrong?
-See for yourself.
1218

1218
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,240
I don't get to spend time with you.
1219

1219
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,720
What are you doing? It tickles.
1220

1220
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,400
They came here, met us,
they should leave now.
1221

1221
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,920
We are newly-weds.
1222

1222
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,760
We need privacy.
1223

1223
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,760
Devi...
1224

1224
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,720
Listen, let's do something.
1225

1225
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,080
Till they are here,
we'll go somewhere else.
1226

1226
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,560
Be ready at 9 A.M. We'll go.
1227

1227
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,000
In fact...
1228

1228
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,120
We should leave now.
1229

1229
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,160
Wait.
1230

1230
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,840
Ask them what they'll eat.
1231

1231
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,720
Okay.
1232

1232
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,480
Listen...
1233

1233
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,880
Who?
1234

1234
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,920
What would you like to have?
1235

1235
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,720
Tell me.
1236

1236
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,200
Who is it at this hour?
1237

1237
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,240
That man...
1238

1238
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,600
Yes.
1239

1239
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,560
You should've stayed longer.
1240

1240
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,800
Really?
1241

1241
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,640
-But...
-Wait.
1242

1242
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,400
-What's the hurry?
-Listen...
1243

1243
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,080
-Taxi cancelled.
-You can leave in some time.
1244

1244
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,800
Give this to him.
1245

1245
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,640
Let's go.
1246

1246
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,160
Let's go.
1247

1247
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,560
You won't come downstairs.
1248

1248
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,200
She'll wave bye from the kitchen.
1249

1249
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:08,760
Okay.
1250

1250
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,040
Go to the kitchen.
1251

1251
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,320
Action!
1252

1252
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,600
Raj!
1253

1253
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,640
-Ouch!
-Hey, Ruby!
1254

1254
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,040
Oh no.
1255

1255
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,880
-Ouch!
-Are you okay?
1256

1256
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,240
It's paining.
1257

1257
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,640
She's injured.
1258

1258
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,120
She's just pretending.
1259

1259
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,720
Over reacting.
1260

1260
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,840
One more.
1261

1261
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,320
-Another retake?
-It's okay.
1262

1262
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,480
-Roll camera.
-Rolling.
1263

1263
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,500
Action!
1264

1264
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,480
-Sir, he's hitting him for real.
-Quiet.
1265

1265
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,720
Looks real.
1266

1266
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,200
-He's hitting him badly.
-Realistic.
1267

1267
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,440
Steady cam, follow me. Come.
1268

1268
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,120
No, sir...
1269

1269
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,760
If even one tear
falls from her eyes...
1270

1270
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,560
What an angle!
1271

1271
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,560
Revolver Raja 3.
1272

1272
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,360
It's not an action film.
1273

1273
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,400
It's a romantic film.
1274

1274
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,040
What?
1275

1275
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,640
You're hurt.
1276

1276
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,880
I'm hurt?
1277

1277
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,160
-Where?
-I'm searching.
1278

1278
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,280
I'd get injured often.
1279

1279
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,400
Move.
1280

1280
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,520
The colours of love...
1281

1281
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,880
Love...
1282

1282
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,480
Love is everywhere
1283

1283
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,520
All the beautiful moments...
1284

1284
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,920
Are all around us
1285

1285
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,440
I love you, be mine
1286

1286
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,520
Let us lose ourselves in love
1287

1287
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:16,560
I love you, be mine
1288

1288
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:21,840
Let us lose ourselves in love
1289

1289
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,920
Our journey of love has begun
1290

1290
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,520
Let us
go on this journey together
1291

1291
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:37,080
Our journey of love has begun
1292

1292
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:42,080
Let us
go on this journey together
1293

1293
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,560
The colours of love...
1294

1294
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,200
Love is everywhere
1295

1295
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,560
You're the one I want
1296

1296
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,120
I have you now
1297

1297
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,800
Life is more beautiful now
1298

1298
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,600
You dwell in my heart
1299

1299
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,040
I love you
1300

1300
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:34,120
I can give my life for you
1301

1301
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:39,040
I love you
Be mine
1302

1302
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:44,720
Let us lose ourselves in love
1303

1303
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,440
Our journey of love has begun
1304

1304
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,640
Let us go
on this journey together
1305

1305
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,240
The colours of love...
1306

1306
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,840
Love is everywhere
1307

1307
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,640
Are you Ruby's manager?
1308

1308
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,000
We want dates.
1309

1309
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,480
A five-film contract.
1310

1310
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,000
You may come here to meet me,
1311

1311
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,120
but don't discuss Ruby's dates.
1312

1312
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,120
I gave the rights for this film.
1313

1313
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,400
Go away!
1314

1314
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,240
Did you give Ruby the letter?
1315

1315
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,000
-No.
-Why?
1316

1316
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,920
Ma'am's dream, this film...
Full concentration.
1317

1317
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,398
If I give her the letter,
she will be disturbed.
1318

1318
01:34:29,445 --> 01:34:30,024
Then?
1319

1319
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,840
Finish the film soon.
1320

1320
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,120
I will give her the letter then.
1321

1321
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,480
Raj...
Sir, good behaviour till then.
1322

1322
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,520
-Good behaviour!
-Even if the director says...
1323

1323
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,880
Don't touch. Keep a safe distance.
1324

1324
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,000
The more you stay away
from the heroine,
1325

1325
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,520
the closer the heroine will get.
1326

1326
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,240
Women's psychology.
1327

1327
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,880
Old formula...
1328

1328
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,520
But works every time.
1329

1329
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,640
Am I making sense?
1330

1330
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:03,960
A lot of sense.
1331

1331
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,640
Everywhere I look, I see you.
1332

1332
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,600
You are all I ask for
1333

1333
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:22,600
I want to get close to you
1334

1334
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:26,240
Take me into your arms
1335

1335
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,920
I love you
Be mine
1336

1336
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,360
Let's lose ourselves in love
1337

1337
01:35:40,163 --> 01:35:40,840
The colours of love...
1338

1338
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,919
Love is everywhere
1339

1339
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,560
I will.
1340

1340
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,640
We will be back.
1341

1341
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,720
Cut it!
1342

1342
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,160
It's a wrap for Revolver Raja.
1343

1343
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,240
The next...
1344

1344
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,200
Yes!
1345

1345
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,360
I'll see you.
1346

1346
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,120
Yes.
1347

1347
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,960
You look happy.
1348

1348
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,280
The film is done. You'll go.
1349

1349
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,360
Happy journey.
1350

1350
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,960
The shoot is done.
1351

1351
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:31,640
The film hasn't released.
1352

1352
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:36,680
I have the contract.
You are under control.
1353

1353
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,080
Let me see it.
1354

1354
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,360
Does it say I'll leave after the shoot
is over?
1355

1355
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,720
My dream
is to see myself on the screen.
1356

1356
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,960
How can I go?
1357

1357
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,520
Grow up, man.
1358

1358
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,640
This is not good.
1359

1359
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,820
Sir...
1360

1360
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,060
Yes, Krishna?
1361

1361
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,360
When will the film be released?
1362

1362
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,340
In two months.
1363

1363
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,400
Two months!
1364

1364
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,680
Why? The shoot is over.
Release it tomorrow. Or...
1365

1365
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,000
Why two months?
1366

1366
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,760
The shoot is over.
Release it tomorrow.
1367

1367
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,400
-Please, sir. You can do it.
-How is it possible?
1368

1368
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,400
-Only you can do it.
-Not possible.
1369

1369
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,080
Nothing is impossible. Please.
1370

1370
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,320
-Hey...
-Please.
1371

1371
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,040
Technical problem.
You don't get it.
1372

1372
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,720
Nonsense!
1373

1373
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,560
What technical problem?
1374

1374
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,840
Hey you! Hey!
1375

1375
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,120
What are you doing?
1376

1376
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,360
Hey!
1377

1377
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,800
Hello! Stop!
1378

1378
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,280
He's gone.
1379

1379
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:53,293
I tried to stop them,
but they took her away.
1380

1380
01:37:53,318 --> 01:37:54,464
Where's ma'am?
1381

1381
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,800
They took ma'am.
1382

1382
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,000
Let's go.
1383

1383
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,400
Amazing story.
1384

1384
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,560
-Hey!
-Hear the narration.
1385

1385
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,320
You will like it.
1386

1386
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,720
Raj, your film is over.
Now, I can sign her.
1387

1387
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,000
Listen...
1388

1388
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,200
If I see you around Ruby...
1389

1389
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,640
If a tear falls from her eye...
1390

1390
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:08,840
Come.
1391

1391
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,600
Follow me.
1392

1392
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:45,800
Devi?
1393

1393
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,640
What's wrong?
1394

1394
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,360
I don't know what's happening to me.
1395

1395
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,880
I don't remember anything.
1396

1396
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,480
Where I go, what I do.
1397

1397
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,720
My head hurts.
1398

1398
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,640
Nothing is wrong.
1399

1399
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,080
No.
1400

1400
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,640
It must be a fatal disease.
1401

1401
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,280
I don't think I'll live long.
1402

1402
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,160
I told you, nothing is wrong.
1403

1403
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,640
If anything happens to me...
1404

1404
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,720
I want you to be happy.
1405

1405
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,080
You should remarry.
1406

1406
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,440
A girl of your choice.
1407

1407
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:44,640
Why did you say that?
1408

1408
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,160
Nothing will happen to you.
1409

1409
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,120
I won't let anything happen.
1410

1410
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,720
Don't think too much.
Go to sleep.
1411

1411
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:14,400
Hello.
1412

1412
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,640
Is the film releasing?
1413

1413
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,240
Yes, it's been difficult.
The struggle...
1414

1414
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,200
Could I get two tickets?
1415

1415
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,640
There's a special show
for people from the industry.
1416

1416
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,520
Get the tickets from the office.
1417

1417
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,080
Thank you, sir.
1418

1418
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:29,040
Yuck!
1419

1419
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,600
I spoke to the manager.
He said I'd get two tickets.
1420

1420
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,840
You don't need tickets
to watch the show, Krishna.
1421

1421
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,440
Did you give the letter to Ruby?
1422

1422
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,480
Yes. Yes, I did.
1423

1423
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,300
It's here. I'll give it to her,
after the film is released.
1424

1424
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,800
I promise.
1425

1425
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,560
You don't need to.
1426

1426
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:46,440
-Decision changed?
-Yes.
1427

1427
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,720
I won't tell her.
1428

1428
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,120
I'll tell the world.
1429

1429
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:57,560
At the press conference.
1430

1430
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,320
Raj weds Ruby.
1431

1431
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,320
And you are my best man.
1432

1432
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,360
Don't tell Ruby.
1433

1433
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:09,800
It's a surprise.
1434

1434
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:11,400
Worst man.
1435

1435
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,640
Ruby won't be there after the film
is released.
1436

1436
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,480
He'll announce it at the press meet.
1437

1437
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:41,720
I will.
1438

1438
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,040
We will be back.
1439

1439
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:48,320
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!
1440

1440
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,720
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!
1441

1441
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,240
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!
1442

1442
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:56,160
Congratulations.
1443

1443
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,480
You're amazing.
1444

1444
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,720
Actually, I'm very lucky.
1445

1445
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,560
I have a surprise for you.
1446

1446
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,560
I'll tell you at the press conference.
1447

1447
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,320
Who are you?
1448

1448
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,960
How you look...
I don't know.
1449

1449
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,400
I'm sure about one thing.
1450

1450
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:35,720
If you were alive,
you would've been very successful.
1451

1451
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,800
Great performance.
1452

1452
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,920
Here comes the new sensation.
1453

1453
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,240
The heroine of Revolver Raja 003,
Miss Ruby.
1454

1454
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,800
You shouldn't have ended your life.
1455

1455
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,040
But I am happy,
1456

1456
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,000
that through Devi,
1457

1457
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,440
you could live your dream.
1458

1458
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:03,120
Can we please have you on stage,
Miss Ruby?
1459

1459
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,520
Wear this sari.
1460

1460
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,000
Devi and I will go.
1461

1461
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,760
We will leave.
1462

1462
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,440
-Sir.
-Just go and check where she is.
1463

1463
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,560
Yes, sir.
1464

1464
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,960
Where?
1465

1465
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,480
Home.
1466

1466
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,760
I won't go.
1467

1467
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,400
Hey!
1468

1468
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,440
Don't joke. Don't play.
1469

1469
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,400
You saw yourself on screen.
1470

1470
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:44,440
You'd said you'd leave.
1471

1471
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,600
Go now.
1472

1472
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,640
Wear this.
1473

1473
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,400
Please.
1474

1474
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,120
Didn't you see...
1475

1475
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,960
People were shouting my name.
1476

1476
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,440
They were praising me.
1477

1477
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,600
They applauded my performance.
1478

1478
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,800
Think before you speak.
1479

1479
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,040
What should I think?
1480

1480
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,640
About why I trusted you,
or why I allowed this?
1481

1481
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:11,600
You've signed a contract.
1482

1482
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,200
Hey...
1483

1483
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,400
Devi and her life...
1484

1484
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,440
Devi...
1485

1485
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,280
Who is Devi?
1486

1486
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,160
There's nothing between you two.
1487

1487
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,280
You want to get rid of her.
1488

1488
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,760
If I use her body,
how will it matter to you?
1489

1489
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,040
Go if you want to.
1490

1490
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,440
I won't go anywhere.
1491

1491
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,640
Ma'am, what are you doing here?
1492

1492
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,520
People are waiting for you.
Mr. Khanna is on stage already.
1493

1493
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,160
Everyone is waiting.
1494

1494
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:50,240
The media people, photographers...
Let's go.
1495

1495
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,760
Ruby, she's here
1496

1496
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:59,120
Put your hands together for Ruby
1497

1497
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:01,920
Ruby, she's here
1498

1498
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,200
Welcome, everyone.
1499

1499
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,280
This is an important day
for our film.
1500

1500
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,640
-This...
-Hey, stop this nonsense!
1501

1501
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:18,840
Stop it.
1502

1502
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:19,820
Ruby...
1503

1503
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,080
Stop it.
1504

1504
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,360
She is...
1505

1505
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,600
What is he saying?
1506

1506
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,400
What is he doing?
1507

1507
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,040
What is he doing?
1508

1508
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:31,060
His voice...
1509

1509
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,320
Just gestures...
1510

1510
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:33,800
No one can hear him.
1511

1511
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Is he okay?
1512

1512
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,600
Is he a fan?
1513

1513
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,440
What is he doing?
1514

1514
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,800
He's saying something.
1515

1515
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:02,280
Sir, people are going mad
after watching our film.
1516

1516
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,640
Revolver Raja 3, superhit.
Ruby, next superstar.
1517

1517
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,920
Wow! What a manager!
1518

1518
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,320
Very good.
1519

1519
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,200
This...
1520

1520
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,400
Please...
1521

1521
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,280
Good evening, everyone.
1522

1522
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,720
We make films.
1523

1523
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:04,800
We act.
1524

1524
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:10,200
But when acting turns to reality,
we don't realise.
1525

1525
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,920
There's a thin line
between reel life and real life.
1526

1526
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,240
I've just realised that.
1527

1527
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:24,000
Ruby is not just my co-star,
1528

1528
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:26,120
but she's the best actor.
1529

1529
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,160
Not only is she a good actress,
1530

1530
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:31,840
but is a good human being too.
1531

1531
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,760
The best thing
that happened to Revolver Raja.
1532

1532
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:42,080
And of course...
1533

1533
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,960
My life.
1534

1534
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,880
On this important day,
1535

1535
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,080
Ruby and I...
1536

1536
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,160
-Both of us...
-Ma'am.
1537

1537
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,480
-Ruby!
-What's wrong?
1538

1538
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:03,800
What happened?
1539

1539
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,080
Move aside.
Please.
1540

1540
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,240
Sir, the doctor
is calling you inside.
1541

1541
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,240
She's fine.
1542

1542
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,720
Are you married?
1543

1543
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,080
Soon.
1544

1544
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,400
Congratulations.
1545

1545
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,180
Thank you.
1546

1546
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,320
She's pregnant.
1547

1547
01:49:58,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Thanks, doctor.
1548

1548
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,760
You love ma'am...
1549

1549
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,040
But ma'am loves me.
1550

1550
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,720
Sorry.
1551

1551
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,560
If a single tear
falls from her eyes...
1552

1552
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,960
Sir. How is ma'am? Is she fine?
1553

1553
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,440
She's pregnant.
1554

1554
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,160
Super news, sir.
God...
1555

1555
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,960
You're such a rockstar, sir.
1556

1556
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,680
You're always rocking, sir.
1557

1557
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:09,000
You didn't tell me.
1558

1558
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:10,480
When did this happen?
1559

1559
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,720
When will junior Raj be born?
1560

1560
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,360
Hello.
1561

1561
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,960
I'll call you.
1562

1562
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,400
It's the jewellery shop.
1563

1563
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:23,880
The pendant you'd ordered for Miss Singh
is ready. What should I do?
1564

1564
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,320
Send it.
1565

1565
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,360
Where?
1566

1566
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:36,320
Strike my name off,
and write Krishna's.
1567

1567
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:38,880
With love.
1568

1568
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,640
Why? Sorry, if I can ask.
1569

1569
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:43,600
You won't understand.
1570

1570
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,440
You're a real hero.
1571

1571
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,400
Amazing! Super!
1572

1572
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,500
Ruby.
1573

1573
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,760
We wish for many things...
1574

1574
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,040
But God's will prevails.
1575

1575
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,920
Your life was ruined.
1576

1576
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:31,880
But you don't have the right
to ruin others' lives.
1577

1577
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,360
I beg you.
1578

1578
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,080
Please return Devi to me.
1579

1579
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,280
I love her a lot.
1580

1580
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,760
Please.
1581

1581
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,560
You.
1582

1582
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,000
Hospital?
1583

1583
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,400
Are you okay?
1584

1584
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,040
I...
1585

1585
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,240
Is it so bad now?
1586

1586
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:15,200
What am I wearing?
1587

1587
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,000
Is it a hospital gown?
1588

1588
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:36,000
It will be the first time
when a husband tells his wife...
1589

1589
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,400
What?
1590

1590
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,800
You are pregnant.
1591

1591
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,200
Devi.
1592

1592
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,440
-Devi.
-What?
1593

1593
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:35,440
What are you doing?
1594

1594
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:38,055
You brought the clothes from the terrace,
but left the towel there.
1595

1595
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,040
I did?
1596

1596
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:56,140
Towel.
1597

1597
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,080
What happened?
1598

1598
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,160
Yippee!
1599

1599
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,080
What happened?
1600

1600
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,000
There was a nameplate here.
1601

1601
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:19,080
It had fallen down,
so I threw it away.
1602

1602
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,760
Was it important?
1603

1603
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,960
It wasn't, was it?
Okay, then.
1604

1604
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,600
-Raj!
-Raj Khanna.
1605

1605
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,480
