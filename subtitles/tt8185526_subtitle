1
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,291
Hey!

2
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,083
Hey, Monchu, come out!

3
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,958
Come out or I'll bash you up...

4
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,374
Hey, crazy!

5
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:34,792
There's a party at the ladies' hostel...
Come quickly!

6
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:44,208
COMIN' BACK

7
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,292
Excuse me...

8
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,375
Please, wake up.

9
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,750
- Hey, man...
- Yeah.

10
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,999
Increase the keyboard...
can't hear it on the monitor.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,167
- Yes, doing it... Now?
- More, more, more...

12
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,624
- Yes! Yes!
- Perfect! Now, the guitar...

13
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,625
One second...

14
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:51,250
- A little bit more...
- Please play in rhythm...

15
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,875
- Feel it...
- Hey!

16
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,833
Cut the crap!
What's going on?

17
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:02,082
I've warned you many times.
Stop this or I'll call the police.

18
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,749
But Uncle this is private property.

19
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,832
Do you even know what
private property is, idiot?

20
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,125
And I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to my tenant.

21
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,832
What's the matter, Arko?
You owe me one and half year's rent...

22
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,291
You're disturbing everyone
all day...

23
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,624
- No, actually, Uncle...
- I'm not your Uncle.

24
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:19,207
Stop with the "Uncle" business...
And pay up.

25
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,292
I'll send you all to the police.

26
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,541
My dad is in a tight spot right now...

27
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,749
Now, you'll be in a tight spot. Right?

28
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,291
Once, you're in the lock-up,
you'll know...

29
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:30,708
Hey, old man,
you can't insult us like this.

30
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,499
We haven't insulted you.

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,375
We're just trying to do
some good music here.

32
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,500
- Do you have a matchbox?
- What?

33
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,542
Matches?

34
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,083
We come here for rehearsals.
You're just wasting our time, man.

35
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,667
- What's your name?
- Why? Ludo.

36
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,166
Yeah, it's not Steve Gadd.
So, why this attitude?

37
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:50,847
- This is a respectable man's house...
- Should I come back tonight?

38
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,542
Please, leave...

39
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,625
Arko, pay up by tomorrow
or I'll throw you out.

40
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,042
Hey!

41
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,833
What nonsense, man?

42
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,625
What're you doing here?

43
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,000
Sanju's friends...

44
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:15,667
dropped his things
off from the hostel...

45
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,708
I've come to keep these here.
I've no space in my house.

46
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,375
What'll I do with these?
Why bring them here?

47
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,583
Rono, I didn't buy the guitar
for Sanju.

48
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,833
You bought it.

49
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:33,457
You're the one who made him crazy
about music... Not me.

50
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,957
Now, you decide what you want
to do with these...

51
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,458
No...

52
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,125
I'm not going to be a part of Sanju's life.

53
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:41,750
Why?

54
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:45,125
The guy has raped.
He is a rapist. That's it!

55
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,292
He has raped...

56
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,207
He should rot in prison...

57
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,499
Why did he do it, Rono?

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,791
He grew up watching us fight...

59
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:59,332
picked up smoking up
and drinking from you...

60
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,749
Lot of kids go through
these things...

61
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,124
They see their parents fight...
See them divorce...

62
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,083
They still study.
They don't go and rape!

63
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,375
But he has learnt everything from you.

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,041
He has picked up smoking weed
and hash from you.

65
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,666
Is smoking up and
raping the same thing?

66
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:23,167
Smoking up and raping are the same thing?
What are you trying to say?

67
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,083
I... See... He...

68
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,833
He has raped...

69
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,374
The police arrested him...
He confessed...

70
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,499
He has confessed that he has raped.

71
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,791
I've singlehandedly raised him...

72
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:42,166
His school, college... all expenses.
I've taken care of everything.

73
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,333
You've never taken any responsibility.

74
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,999
Through out my life,
I've done everything on my own...

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,333
I've done all my duties...

76
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,582
You wanted his custody. I gave it.
What's there to discuss?

77
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,667
Please, take those with you...

78
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,125
I'm not taking it with me, Rono.

79
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,750
It'll stay here because I don't have space.

80
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,958
And even if there was space,
I wouldn't take it because...

81
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,875
whatever Sanju has done,
whatever he's become...

82
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,792
is because of you...

83
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:16,083
Strange! Drinking and raping?!

84
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,208
Did you call Ranjana?

85
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,167
She is not answering...

86
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,125
What will you do now?

87
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,292
I'll go home.

88
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:41,916
Great! Come to rehearsals.
Smoke up. Go home.

89
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:44,583
- Back to Jamshedpur?
- Bloody landlord is creating trouble...

90
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,375
Dad's business is also not doing well.

91
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,833
This band is not working out...

92
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,666
And Ranjana will never pick up the phone.

93
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,500
But why won't she?
She is your girlfriend, man.

94
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,957
In such a time, she needs you,
not the landlord.

95
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,667
She is unwell.

96
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,417
She has just come back from the hospital.

97
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,500
What do you think?
I haven't been to her place?

98
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,250
What did she say?

99
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,749
When did you go to meet her?

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,041
Her father drove me out.

101
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:16,667
But you haven't done anything.

102
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,957
The guy from engineering...
Some Sanju or Ranju is the one who did it.

103
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,207
Go tell her dad that...

104
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,082
No one from the university is allowed
at her place now.

105
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,916
She's been raped. Try and understand.
She is in trauma.

106
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,582
Will she flirt with you over the phone now?

107
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,208
It's ringing.

108
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,667
Yes, tell me.

109
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,833
Which one?

110
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,583
What do you want to talk about?
We went over everything yesterday.

111
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,333
Oh God!

112
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,500
Didn't you speak to Mr. Dutta yesterday?

113
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,583
Hold on...

114
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,917
Malati, give me my juice!

115
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,042
Yeah...

116
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,250
But we talked about everything yesterday.

117
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,082
Yeah... Yeah, I'm carrying them
with me but...

118
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,708
you fix up the appointment
with Mr. Dutta, okay?

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,083
Bring my yellow file too...

120
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,208
Okay. We'll talk later.
I'm on my way.

121
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,500
Yeah, I'll reach in half an hour.
Yeah, okay... Thanks.

122
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:25,374
Oona, I've asked you a million times
not to smoke in the living room.

123
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,375
Here we go...

124
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,999
Malati, will you give me my juice?

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,167
It's my home too, Mom.

126
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,708
Exactly!

127
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,167
This is home...

128
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,708
Not your college common room
where you smoke up.

129
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:41,542
When was the last time you went to college?
Tell me, I'm all ears.

130
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,583
I've been working hard since morning.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

131
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:50,582
Smoking, drinking, watching porn...

132
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,458
Listen, this is not porn.
This is a Korean film.

133
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,583
Don't you dare talk back...

134
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,309
- Doesn't understand anything...
- Nonsense...

135
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,166
Are you taking the medicines
Dr. Banerjee prescribed?

136
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,333
Malati!

137
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,500
- Are you bringing my breakfast?
- Listen...

138
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,249
I'm fed up of
your daily soap opera...

139
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,958
Just because you earn the money,
you think you own me?

140
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,333
You destroyed Dad's life...

141
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,208
And now you're after my life.

142
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,583
Listen...

143
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,750
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

144
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,375
Your father was a good-for-nothing.

145
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,500
Failure.

146
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:37,000
Day in and day out, the way
he has behaved with me...

147
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,250
you don't have to know...

148
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:46,957
He couldn't accept my success. That's it!

149
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,250
Success? What success?

150
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,750
You're not saving the world, you know.

151
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,041
You just want to hang a poor guy...

152
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:58,042
Yes, because he is a bloody rapist.
He has raped the girl.

153
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,624
If only you had the maturity to understand
what I'm doing...

154
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,958
you wouldn't be just smoking up
and drinking... And spouting rubbish...

155
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,166
- Madam.
- What?

156
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,542
Client is here.

157
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,667
He won't be hanged?

158
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,708
Capital punishment is difficult to come by
these days, Mrinal.

159
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,666
And life sentence for a 25 year old
means he's finished.

160
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,458
Most importantly, you've to make sure
you can bring your daughter to court.

161
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:36,583
Ranjana has become like...

162
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:40,667
She shuts herself in the
bathroom for hours...

163
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,542
She's not talking to anyone...

164
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,542
She's not eating properly either...

165
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,542
How will I bring her to court?

166
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:53,708
Doctor has advised complete bed rest.

167
00:10:54,875 --> 00:11:00,500
I understand but it's very important
for her to be present in court.

168
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,333
She has to hold her head high
in front of everyone.

169
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,792
How will it help if she locks herself
in the house?

170
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:17,000
He ruined my daughter's life
and he won't be hanged for it?

171
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,207
You'll have to let me do my work,
my way...

172
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm telling you,
he'll be punished.

173
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,500
You head home. Speak to your daughter
and try to make her understand...

174
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:31,833
Do whatever you can to
bring her to court...

175
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,625
I have another hearing...

176
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,708
If I can, I'll drop by your place...

177
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,042
Thank you.

178
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,708
- Oh, your cheque?
- Please, give it to Ali.

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,375
Thank you.

180
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:08,292
Mansoor has some information on Sanjay
from the university, madam.

181
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,083
We can deal with that later.

182
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,042
Let's take care of Tewari, first.

183
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,332
- Do you have a change of 100 bucks?
- Sorry?

184
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,625
Let it be.

185
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,542
Can you stop misbehaving and
do something productive with your life?

186
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,333
You are not a baby anymore...

187
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:30,208
Ranjana! Ranjana!
Ranjana, open the door!

188
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,749
Please, don't do this.
Please, please, open the door...

189
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,374
Don't listen to your dad.
You don't have to go anywhere.

190
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,791
I'm here with you.

191
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,750
I promise I'll take you to Bangalore
with me.

192
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,625
You don't have to go to court.

193
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:50,833
Ranjana, please open the door.
Ranjana!

194
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,583
Ranjana, please open the door.

195
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,166
Don't do this, Ranjana...

196
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,374
Hello, hello, please don't hang up...

197
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,332
Hello, Ranjana...
I know what you're going through.

198
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:05,666
I had come to meet you
but your dad didn't let me...

199
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,124
My situation is also not great...

200
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:12,667
The landlord is forcing me to leave
because I haven't paid rent...

201
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,875
I don't think I can
do music anymore...

202
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,208
Was Jojo here?

203
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,500
Oona?

204
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,083
Oona, I'm talking to you.

205
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,292
What is it?

206
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,542
I've asked you nicely a lot of times...

207
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,042
Having an affair with someone old enough
to be your father is not okay...

208
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:28,167
What's your problem?
That he's old enough to be my father?

209
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,000
Or because he was your boyfriend?

210
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,707
Seriously, there is limit to how much
one can misbehave...

211
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,125
One second...

212
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,583
So, now I have learn about limits from you?

213
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,874
You had a lot of affairs
when you're my age.

214
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,583
Do you want me to remind you?

215
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:50,792
Listen, practice what you preach.
I don't want to discuss this...

216
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,083
This is my house.

217
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:01,541
And that man will not enter my house.
And that's final. Understood?

218
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,458
And what will you do if he does?

219
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,833
You'll hang him too, right?

220
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,833
What else can you do?

221
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,333
Look, darling... Can I ever wish you ill?

222
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,625
That guy... Sanjay...
Who has done this to you...

223
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,666
He has to be punished.

224
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:28,666
Brother, can we not discuss this
during dinner?

225
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,375
Let her eat in peace...

226
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:33,833
No, I'll make sure that guy is punished!

227
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,667
It's okay.

228
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:40,667
If your mother was alive she would have
expected the same from me.

229
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,500
Will you shut it?
Let her eat.

230
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:49,458
What's wrong with what I am saying?
Why should I shut up?

231
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,708
I'll make sure that guy hangs!

232
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:00,542
The entire media is on your side...

233
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,125
They're waiting to hear from you.

234
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,167
Why won't you say anything?

235
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,667
You haven't done anything wrong.

236
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,583
Please try and understand how important
it is to stand up in court.

237
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,791
Gargi just said...

238
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,999
- if you appear in court once...
- Finish your food...

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,792
we'll win the case.

240
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,292
Otherwise, the case might get dismissed.

241
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,167
Ranjana! Ranjana!

242
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:31,833
Are you happy now?

243
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:41,375
Where is Ranjana?
She's not ready yet?

244
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,666
- She doesn't want to go...
- What do you mean?

245
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,917
I really tried...

246
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,708
Can you please talk to her?

247
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:09,416
Ranjana, if you don't come to court today,
the hearing will be postponed again...

248
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,957
And the trouble will continue...

249
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,417
And at one point, the judge will decide...

250
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:21,375
That this is not a genuine accusation... that
you're not raped. And he'll go scot-free...

251
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:26,167
Who will be most humiliated?

252
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,500
Who will suffer the most?

253
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:40,083
Only you can prove the
truth in court and...

254
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,416
The judge will rule based
on your testimony...

255
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:47,249
Not what the police
or the university people say...

256
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,208
They don't even matter.

257
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,624
You have your family's support...

258
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,874
They're trying so hard but you...

259
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,250
What do you think? If it's prolonged...

260
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:04,208
It will change the fact
that you were raped?

261
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,792
If he's punished, will it change the fact
that I was raped?

262
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,875
No...

263
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,208
It won't...

264
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:17,375
Nothing can be changed...

265
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,791
You're an intelligent, educated woman...

266
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:24,749
How don't you get it, that if you appear
then the case will move ahead?

267
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,542
Not just one step... We'll go
miles ahead... You don't get it?

268
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,417
Yes, you'll win another case.

269
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,500
- You'll also win.
- How will I win?

270
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,957
You'll live the rest of your life
with your head held high.

271
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,875
Don't you think it's important?

272
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,042
Don't you want to do that?

273
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,042
I don't feel like holding my head high
right now.

274
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,167
Ranjana...

275
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,208
Hey...

276
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,083
Oh God!

277
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,625
Who got this box?

278
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:50,208
It was outside.
I brought it in.

279
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,208
Why?

280
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,042
For your own good.

281
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,999
Why do you have to concern yourself
with my well being?

282
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,750
Why do you touch my stuff?

283
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:05,917
You can't remember where you keep your things.
And I'm the villian for keeping things in order.

284
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:11,083
Why have you brought this in?
I had thrown it out...

285
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,625
Why do you talk to me like this?

286
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,416
Because I feel like.

287
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,291
You don't do your own work.

288
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,957
Why have you brought this stuff
inside the house?

289
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,499
- I am telling you...
- Listen...

290
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,291
You are the maid, please
behave like one, okay...

291
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:30,542
Don't talk to me like this
or I'll quit...

292
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,500
Leave.

293
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,707
Listen... Just leave.

294
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,332
Go on... Get out...

295
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,582
- Are you sure?
- Yes. You don't have to do anything anymore.

296
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,333
- I'll not come back once I leave.
- You don't have to.

297
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,917
Hey, hey, Monchu!

298
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,667
Come out.

299
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,042
Come out or I'll bash you up...

300
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,458
Hey, crazy guy!

301
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,707
Come on... There's a party
at the ladies' hostel...

302
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,333
Let's go...

303
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,832
These rapists should be hanged.

304
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:31,499
How can we just hang people?

305
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,917
Why?

306
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:34,207
Do you know what the law says?

307
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,000
What?

308
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:40,874
The culprit can only be hanged
when he has raped and murdered.

309
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:45,499
So, one has to do two crimes.
Rape and murder?

310
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,083
Don't come to such a simplistic solution...

311
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:53,041
You'll have to see how our society
is changing...

312
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,791
The recent rape victim...
Ranjana...

313
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,707
Her rapist doesn't deserve
to be hanged?

314
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,957
- Then everyone will rape...
- No, no, no...

315
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,249
There'll be rape on every street corner...

316
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,916
- These bloody men should be made afraid...
- Hear me out...

317
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,541
You must understand the...

318
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:09,791
Our society is changing...
No more joint families...

319
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:13,791
Our society has become more permissive...

320
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,582
And the influence of the smart phones...

321
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:20,291
And the smart phones make it easier
for people to sext or watch porn.

322
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:23,332
Everything is so easily accessible.
People live in a virtual world.

323
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,541
Okay, tell me why do people get raped?

324
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,957
- You can't ask questions like that...
- No, tell me... why?

325
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,416
I'm trying to make you understand...

326
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:35,082
Answer a simple question.
Why do rapes happen?

327
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,042
No, answer my question...

328
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,958
Why do rapes happen?

329
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,250
Who are you?

330
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:43,082
- Why should I answer you?
- Tell me why people rape?

331
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,791
Wait, wait... Why don't you tell us?

332
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,624
- You're discussing rape, that's why...
- We are... What is that to you?

333
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,000
I don't why.
You seem to know. Tell me...

334
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:55,249
- You guys were discussing so...
- Yes, so what...

335
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,457
I know the cause for heart burn or dysentery...
but don't know the cause of rape...

336
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,958
Heart burn, dysentery, rape...

337
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,041
Have you lost your mind?

338
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,999
Do you talk like this with your family?

339
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,999
You have no right to judge
how I talk to my family.

340
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,374
I'm pretty sure that families like yours
produce rapists...

341
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,707
- Don't touch me... Dont you dare...
- What do you mean? Get away from here...

342
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,957
- Don't touch me...
- Let it go, Joga... - Shoo...

343
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,639
- God, knows where these crazies come from?
- Who was he? Let it be.

344
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,707
- Bloody... Why should I let it go?
- Let it go, Joga...

345
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,749
He is just an aberration...

346
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:32,541
I'm telling you, Probal, these are rapists
in waiting...

347
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:36,208
- No, these guys don't represent our society...
- Don't intellectualise it...

348
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,374
Are you going to drink everyday?

349
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,582
- I drink with my money.
- Please shut up...

350
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,332
- What are the kids learning?
- Whatever they can...

351
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,749
Please, let me study...

352
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,708
- You can't study... You want to see...
- You are hurting me...

353
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,583
This is hurting you... But
not when Bhola comes over.

354
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,500
- Where's my money?
- No one's touched your money... He's a good guy.

355
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:56,833
- You give money to Bhola... You thieves!
- No one has stolen your money...

356
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:59,332
Dad, please keep it quiet...
Mom, please stop...

357
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,042
- The money I work hard for...
- I haven't touched your money.

358
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,166
- I'll show you...
- You're hurting me...

359
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:04,625
What are you doing?

360
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,625
Keep it down!

361
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,457
Die! All of you die!

362
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,875
You don't have to ever come back...

363
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Your high fades away

364
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:38,750
Like mist on a sunny day

365
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:46,917
So hopelessness too ends one day

366
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:57,833
So hopelessness too ends one day

367
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:11,457
Burns away your cigarette

368
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:16,208
There's always an expiry date

369
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:24,583
So, hatred too has to fade away

370
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:35,833
Anger too has to fade away

371
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:49,292
You gotta let your old clothes go

372
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:54,833
Empty bottles, your old fashioned woes

373
00:26:55,125 --> 00:27:00,125
Thou has turned to You

374
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:05,375
High will turn to low

375
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:12,833
So, tears and hurt will have to go

376
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,708
Heartaches too will have to go

377
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:11,000
Gotta change bed sheets now and then

378
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:16,500
Gotta let go of dusty dreams

379
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,083
Though it's cloudy it may never rain

380
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,374
Gotta keep your umbrellas closed

381
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:35,375
So, fear one day will turn into hope...

382
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:46,750
And fear one day will turn into hope...

383
00:28:55,208 --> 00:29:00,624
Your high fades away

384
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:05,958
Like mist on a sunny day

385
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:14,042
So, hopelessness too ends one day

386
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:25,042
And hopelessness too ends one day

387
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:35,958
So, hopelessness too ends one day

388
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:48,458
Ma'am, please open the door. Ma'am...

389
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,375
- Your mom is having a seizure again..
- What?

390
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,541
- Mom... Mom...
- Ma'am, what's happening to you?

391
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:01,832
- Where does it hurt?
- Wait, wait... slowly...

392
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,832
- Don't move your arm like that...
- Ma'am, please relax...

393
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:07,791
- Hello... No network here...
- How long has she been like this?

394
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,583
- I came in and saw her like this...
- And you informed me now?

395
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,291
- You'll be fine, Mom...
- Hello...

396
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:13,874
- Where is it hurting, Mom?
- Hello... Hello...

397
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,291
- Did you get through?
- Not yet... wait...

398
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:18,124
- Stand still, you won't get network...
- Hello... Hello...

399
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,499
- Did you give her sorbitrate?
- Doc, this is Deepak...

400
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,458
You're very careless...

401
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:27,249
- This is Deepak...
- You've done enough...

402
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,791
She is having another attack...

403
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:32,333
- What is the blood pressure?
- What is it? Did you check?

404
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,041
- It was a little low...
- How low?

405
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,458
What was the blood pressure?

406
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,667
- 80 by 40...
- That's very low...

407
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,625
80 by 40.

408
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:40,874
Mom, Mom...

409
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:44,583
If you could please come over...

410
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,832
Thank you, Doc.

411
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,292
Nothing will happen to you...

412
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,125
Stop the saline.
Doc is coming.

413
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,874
She is stable now.
She'll be on saline and oxygen.

414
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:59,625
- Come on...
- I just can't take it any more...

415
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:05,458
I thought Sanju will be better off
in the hostel.

416
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:06,707
What did he end up doing?

417
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,875
Let it go... You need to rest.

418
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,667
And here my mother...

419
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:17,291
Everyday... the same old routine...

420
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,166
Yes but she is okay now.

421
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,167
I can't take it anymore.

422
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,708
- Do you want some tea?
- I just can't...

423
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,125
I am making tea...

424
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:37,292
Please drink the milk.

425
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,750
You've suffered a lot, darling.

426
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,083
You haven't slept all night.

427
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:52,208
Your father has also suffered...
He couldn't sleep either.

428
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:59,707
When your uncle passed away,
I lost everything too...

429
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,874
I was all alone.

430
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:05,042
I brought up Ani by myself.

431
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,708
And now Ani...

432
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,292
is settled abroad.

433
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:16,083
When your mother passed away...

434
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,792
Your father was also left alone.

435
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,458
He brought you up all alone...

436
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:28,500
He never let you feel that your mom
is dead.

437
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:33,333
Everyone suffers...
It's part of life.

438
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:38,000
Have any of you been raped at 20?

439
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,374
Morning!

440
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,749
What happened?

441
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:49,208
Why so quiet? Packing up?

442
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,667
Because you asked us to.

443
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,583
Wait... What was your name?

444
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,667
Chess...

445
00:32:57,668 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh yeah... Ludo! Yes...

446
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:04,000
Do you have a lighter?

447
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,583
Wait...

448
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,958
Hey, give it to him...

449
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,957
What is it, Arko?
Why are you packing?

450
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,542
No, actually...

451
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:20,375
I can't pay you the rent right now...

452
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:26,083
Please sit down, guys...
I have something to say...

453
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,292
So, I was saying...

454
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Arko, if you do me a favour,
I'll pardon your rent...

455
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,583
- You mean cancel?
- Exactly.

456
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,292
If you do my favour, then no rent.

457
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,792
What is the favour?

458
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,208
I have a few songs...

459
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,083
That you have to record.

460
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,625
Record?

461
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:06,167
I was a sound recordist with Saregama.

462
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,208
What songs?

463
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:14,583
I have some songs...
I mean 8 - 9 songs...

464
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:20,125
If you don't change
the lyrics and composition...

465
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,667
Everyone plays and you sing...

466
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:28,167
Just a matter of a couple of days...
I can sing a few songs too...

467
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,333
You write songs?

468
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,833
I used to write.

469
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,208
Where will you record?

470
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,792
Here, in this house.

471
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:44,000
Don't worry, I have the equipment.

472
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,666
I mean the recording won't be bad.

473
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,708
What will you do with the songs?

474
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,917
His rent will be cancelled.

475
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:57,500
One and half year's rent.
You are his friend, right?

476
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:02,457
Do this for your friend.
His rent will be cancelled.

477
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:07,417
But don't take a hasty decision...
Think about it...

478
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:12,333
Do you want to help him or not?

479
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,792
I'll be upstairs.
Arko, think about it.

480
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,292
What you're going to do...

481
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,000
Excuse me...

482
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,042
Yesterday's...

483
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,083
Chicken was great...

484
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:46,042
Nightmares get worse

485
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:50,333
Illness and curse

486
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:57,125
Yet comes another day
children sing and swirl

487
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:06,458
On the streets they dance and swirl

488
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:14,750
Another new morning in this big bad world

489
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:21,707
Again there's a bombing in Syria

490
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:25,917
My neighbourhood burns in hysteria

491
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:32,250
Yet there's a peddler cookin'
his meal on the road

492
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:41,375
Yet there is someone eatin'
his meal on the road

493
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:50,958
Another new morning in this big bad world

494
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
This is now...
This will be...

495
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:08,500
Here in this big mad world

496
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:41,708
Childhood dreams and old torn shoes

497
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,083
Gotta get rid of old time blues

498
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:52,833
Gotta stop cryin' and movin' on, my girl

499
00:37:55,083 --> 00:38:02,333
Gotta move on with the rest of the world

500
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:10,917
Another new morning in this big bad world

501
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:20,167
This is now...
This will be...

502
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:29,125
Here in this big mad world

503
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:34,917
Though you're tired,
you're still on your feet

504
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:39,167
The supper is lousy, you still gotta eat

505
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:46,333
'Cause the fisherman's
net is ready and curled

506
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:54,583
The net will soon again be hurled

507
00:38:57,042 --> 00:39:03,542
Another new morning in this big bad world

508
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:13,542
This is now...
This will be...

509
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Here in this big mad world

510
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:31,458
This is now...
This will be...

511
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:39,458
Here in this big mad world

512
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:51,750
So, you've settled down here...

513
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:57,708
I have my own place, Rono.
At New Alipore...

514
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:04,875
But I've to stay here
for your mother-in-law.

515
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,125
She's dying a little everyday...

516
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,457
Her kidney is failing
for the last 4 years.

517
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,875
Do you even know?

518
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,791
You're having an affair with my wife...

519
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:28,042
You'll marry her once
the old woman dies...

520
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:32,875
If you don't take care of her mom,
who will?

521
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:39,125
Have you come to start a fight?

522
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,875
No...

523
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,583
I wanted to give Mala something.

524
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,666
Mala is at her store.

525
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:51,833
You can leave it with me.

526
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,792
Don't you have work?

527
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,042
Night shift...

528
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,042
You're paying for Sanju's lawyer?

529
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:14,083
Are you going to pay?

530
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:29,167
It's very difficult to save him...
What he has done...

531
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:32,667
What has he grown up with?

532
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:37,250
He was admitted to a mental hospital
because of you...

533
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,750
You've beaten him up regularly...

534
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,375
You've used belts and hangers...

535
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:49,958
Just because he wanted to be a footballer
not a singer...

536
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:56,875
You even abused Mala
when she tried to intervene...

537
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,083
Rono, leave it with me...

538
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,333
And please...

539
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,625
Don't come back here...

540
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,208
Is it paining?

541
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,500
This...

542
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,625
There are some songs on this CD.
Please, listen to them.

543
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,792
You'll like them...

544
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:14,999
Play this CD for her.

545
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,750
Since ma'am has taken the TV away,
she only listens to music.

546
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:20,583
Please listen to it.

547
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,917
There are quite a few songs...

548
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,832
I'm sure you'll like it...

549
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:31,167
There are 5-6 songs...

550
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:25,583
Sorry... Sorry... Sorry...

551
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,916
Sorry, I'm a little late, Mr. Banerjee...

552
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,875
I can see that.

553
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:43,541
I know Mansoor has sold the information
to you.

554
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:49,250
But you know that it won't hold water
as evidence in court...

555
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:53,374
I had ordered this for you.
Okay?

556
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,000
Yes, of course... Thanks...

557
00:44:56,625 --> 00:45:00,500
So, the question is if
it works as evidence?

558
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:07,542
Sanju had spent a year in the
mental hospital when he was 16.

559
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,083
He has a psychiatric history.

560
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:13,374
I don't know how you can say
that this is not evidence...

561
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,250
But he was treated.

562
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
The doctor had declared him fit.

563
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:20,208
He was studying and
living in the college hostel...

564
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:24,625
Suddenly at 24, he loses his sanity
and rapes someone?

565
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,541
Is it very believable?

566
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:29,958
It's funny...
It's absurd.

567
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:37,792
But as Sanjay Sen's lawyer,
I'll have to defend him.

568
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:41,291
So, it's about time that
you cut the crap...

569
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:44,124
You should concentrate on bringing the girl
to court...

570
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:50,624
Because otherwise the
case will be dismissed...

571
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,416
- Right...
- I mean your boss...

572
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:56,291
How long can she push the dates back?

573
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:59,542
You are absolutely right.
One second.

574
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:03,167
Looks familiar?

575
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:07,167
Doesn't it look like Mandarmoni?
And the girl is an actress in TV serials...

576
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,917
Now, this won't go to court.
Only a message will be sent to your wife.

577
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:19,082
The photos were taken by Mansoor himself.

578
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:23,708
Now, you have to decide
where you want place the evidence.

579
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:26,167
And thanks for the drink.

580
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,083
It's all good but that's not Mandarmoni.
It's Bakkhali.

581
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,791
And the girl acts in theatre not serial.

582
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:39,541
My wife's number has changed.
Note down the new number.

583
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:41,542
It'll be easier to send her the message.

584
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,166
What confidence!

585
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,583
Don't waste it on me,
you'll need it for your wife. Bye.

586
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,500
Madam... Madam...

587
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,166
What did he say?

588
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:58,208
He's putting up a brave front
but he's quite scared.

589
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:02,333
That's a relief!

590
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:06,374
Get in the car.
I'll drop you home.

591
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:08,056
Should I organise the files in the office?

592
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,458
No... I'll take it.

593
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
- Okay.
- Give...

594
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,958
- Come...
- It's okay. I live close by.

595
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,292
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.
Good bye, madam.

596
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:24,750
I left the files in the car.
Bring them up in the morning. Bye.

597
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:52,500
Tell me...

598
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,166
Tell me...

599
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:02,125
You don't know what I want to say?

600
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,625
It's about Oona...

601
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:07,832
She's come to me on her own.

602
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,333
I can't ask her to leave.

603
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:15,458
You know very well what I can do.

604
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:17,332
What? Hang me?

605
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:21,417
Do you know about Section 366?
Kidnapping... Non-bailable...

606
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:25,707
And I'll add adultery to that.
And I'll win the case.

607
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,125
And you'll go behind bars.

608
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:34,000
Your career as a documentary filmmaker
will be over.

609
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:37,874
There's only one problem...
She's not a minor.

610
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:41,207
But she has a history of mental
depression... She's taking pills...

611
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:46,917
And I'll ask Dr. Banerjee
to take the stand... Simple...

612
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:52,625
Lovely, you'll prove your daughter
is crazy... Won't you feel ashamed?

613
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:57,667
Nope... I won't feel ashamed...
Neither will I feel bad...

614
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:01,999
You're taking advantage of her simplicity.
Aren't you feeling ashamed?

615
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
What advantage?

616
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,750
What advantage?

617
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,457
Gargi, she is happy with me.

618
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:17,208
She doesn't want to have those medicines.
She wants to lead a normal life.

619
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,208
Why are you laughing?

620
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,291
What's so funny?

621
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:25,917
A normal life with someone
her father's age?

622
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,000
- Wonderful...
- Listen... you...

623
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:33,833
You shouldn't destroy her life
because we broke up...

624
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,184
This is not right... Please...

625
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:41,875
If my daughter is not home tomorrow,
you'll be served legal notice.

626
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,833
I'll see you in court.

627
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:53,042
Why are you doing this?

628
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,333
I've one last...

629
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:50,083
No one sings no more on a sad afternoon

630
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:58,167
There ain't no birds
chirping in the midday gloom

631
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:04,958
There ain't no birds

632
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:14,125
So, I keep the tears inside... I can't cry

633
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:32,749
All my fairy stories are
no longer like before

634
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:37,582
My favourite childhood
shirt don't fit me no more

635
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:45,583
Don't know why

636
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:56,500
So, I avoid the rain and am dry

637
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:04,708
No one sings no more on a sad afternoon

638
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:12,833
There ain't no birds
chirping in the midday gloom

639
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:19,625
There ain't no birds

640
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:28,750
So, I keep the tears inside... I can't cry

641
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:39,208
So, I keep the tears inside... I can't cry

642
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:11,333
At dawn, I no longer see the dawn

643
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:32,708
When morning breaks I don't see the dawn

644
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:42,625
When was it? And why?

645
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I forgot to feel the dew at night

646
00:53:56,875 --> 00:54:02,042
I scribble no longer.
I doodle no more

647
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:10,083
Sparrows come and go.
They don't chirp no more

648
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:16,958
They don't fly

649
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:25,833
So, when I feel the blues I don't cry

650
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,792
Mom had solid food today...

651
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:33,708
Really? Did you tell the doctor?

652
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:40,375
She's listening to the same song
all day...

653
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,167
- Whose song?
- That I don't know.

654
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,917
But Mom is better.

655
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:50,333
She's off the saline too...

656
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,500
Can I tell you something?

657
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:55,458
- Should I get some food delivered?
- No...

658
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,125
I've made some mutton curry...

659
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:01,333
I cooked after a long time...

660
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:03,708
With rice?

661
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:07,000
Fried rice!

662
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:15,583
Jhumu, get me some hot water...

663
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:23,125
Why did Sanju do this, Deepak?

664
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,500
Mala...

665
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:35,791
I grew up in my uncle's home
because my parents got a divorce.

666
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:37,958
Should I hold on to that?

667
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,708
You're looking beautiful.

668
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:52,333
I'm very hungry...

669
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,833
No one sings no more on a sad afternoon

670
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:05,917
There ain't no birds
chirping in the midday gloom

671
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:13,208
There ain't no birds

672
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:21,875
So, I keep the tears inside... I can't cry

673
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:32,625
I don't feel rain... I'm always dry

674
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:42,792
I don't touch the dew at night...

675
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,917
She'll have to appear in court next Monday.

676
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,999
Otherwise, the case will be dismissed.
Explain that to her.

677
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,708
There's one thing I don't get...

678
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,000
She doesn't stay in the hostel.

679
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:59,417
Why did she go to the party at night?

680
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,625
Why did you give her permission?

681
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,374
It's your fault.

682
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:04,833
Explain that to her...

683
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:09,166
I've asked her many times not to go
to college in those short clothes...

684
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,125
But...

685
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:13,667
Boys nowadays are not like us...

686
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:19,416
Some people are playing in a band...
She just had to join them...

687
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:22,375
There's a performance in the college
at night... She just had to go...

688
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:25,875
Don't we know what happens
in these places?

689
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:30,667
- But you have to make her understand...
- I want to go to court, Dad.

690
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,374
What should I wear?

691
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:33,832
What do you mean?

692
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:38,791
Short skirt, long skirt, saree or a burkha?
What should I wear?

693
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,499
Why are you talking like this?

694
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,750
No... It's my fault.

695
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:47,000
I was raped because I wore short skirts
to college at night.

696
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:51,375
- It's my fault...
- No one is blaming you, Ranjana...

697
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:54,833
- But if you don't go to court...
- If I don't go to court...

698
00:57:55,792 --> 00:58:00,750
if I don't attend the press conference,
it'll be proved that I wasn't raped...

699
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,292
Okay... I wasn't raped...

700
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:07,292
It's over.
Are you happy?

701
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:11,083
It's not a question of happiness
or sadness, Ranjana.

702
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:13,417
It's the law.

703
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:17,583
If you don't take the stand,
it can't be proved that you...

704
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,917
were raped.

705
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,124
No one will believe it.

706
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm telling you I wasn't raped...

707
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:29,042
I was wearing short clothes and flirting
with that guy at the ladies' hostel.

708
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:32,292
But that's not the truth, Ranjana.

709
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,042
Then what is the truth, Aunty?

710
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:40,125
I'll go to court.

711
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:47,417
And I assume that the guy
will be punished...

712
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,957
And I assume...

713
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:55,124
that all the women in Calcutta will stop
wearing short clothes...

714
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:57,583
In fact, I'll stop too...

715
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:01,542
But... Will that...

716
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,250
stop all the rapes in Calcutta?

717
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,250
What kind of logic is that?

718
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:11,000
I don't care what happens to anyone
in Calcutta, Ranjana.

719
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:14,750
I'm doing everything for your honour...

720
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:18,707
My honour is important for you, Dad?

721
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,000
Of course, it is.

722
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,292
How can you question that?

723
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,082
Otherwise, why would I run around?

724
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:28,999
Why am I going to the lawyer?
Why am I insisting that you come to court?

725
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,958
You started it, Dad.

726
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:37,667
The law doubts me
because I'm not appearing in court.

727
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:43,708
And you, my father, are doubting me...

728
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,208
Ranjana...

729
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,916
Ranjana will run off from home

730
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:37,000
Nilanjan will stand up alone

731
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:41,500
Leave his two-bit job just like that

732
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:46,332
Shibu and Sheela will elope

733
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:49,292
Sanjay will no longer grope

734
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:53,708
No longer will he live like a rat

735
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,833
A wish to suddenly feel free

736
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:07,000
To be myself and not just somebody

737
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:13,083
So lai la lai la lai

738
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:18,417
Gonna do what pleases me

739
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:27,750
Be what I wanna be Lai la lai

740
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,666
Samiran will not take the pills

741
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,749
Will not suffer from the guilt

742
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:46,083
Anjan will not imitate Dylan

743
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,999
The one who writes a song will write

744
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,124
If not the left, then about right

745
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:58,500
There ain't no clouds but it may rain

746
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,958
A wish to suddenly feel free

747
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:11,583
To be myself and not just somebody

748
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:17,625
So lai la lai la lai

749
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:23,125
Gonna do what pleases me

750
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:32,292
Be what I wanna be Lai la lai

751
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:48,417
Why do you want me
to sing the songs?

752
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:55,917
Because I'm cancelling your rent.

753
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,792
What's that to you?

754
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,625
Why me?

755
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:08,625
You're not going to release
the songs anywhere and...

756
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,375
What's the point of this?

757
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,833
Do you drink vodka?

758
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,917
Do you?

759
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,708
Those songs...

760
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:43,667
You've sung quite well...

761
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,958
You have a great voice...

762
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,125
Cheers!

763
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:06,292
Have you ever wanted to be a singer?

764
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,667
That was a long time ago...

765
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:26,875
I was thinking...

766
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:30,625
I'll go back to Jamshedpur.

767
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:37,208
Because your girlfriend
is not answering your phone. Right?

768
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:45,125
Am I right?

769
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,417
She has a lot of problems right now...

770
01:04:56,417 --> 01:05:01,625
All problems are eventually solved.

771
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,333
This can't be fixed.

772
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:10,125
You sing really well, buddy...

773
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,500
But I can't...

774
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:24,667
write good songs.
No one listens to me.

775
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:31,000
Sing other people's songs...

776
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,375
- You're kidding me, right?
- Nope...

777
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:41,375
When you sang these songs...

778
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:44,042
the songs...

779
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:47,667
became yours.

780
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:09,958
I was always...

781
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:16,917
scared of you...

782
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,917
I hope you're not scared anymore.

783
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,917
Not like before.

784
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,667
Come on...

785
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:01,667
Let's record a song. Okay?

786
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,583
Let's go...

787
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:19,458
If you gotta go you better say

788
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:27,750
If you gotta leave you turn away

789
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:37,000
When the deal is down,
you throw your cards

790
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:44,917
In the end, we're all cigarettes

791
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:53,958
City streets turn silent when it's late

792
01:07:54,500 --> 01:08:01,833
You make love, then you separate

793
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:11,292
Dirt and dust are blown away by storm

794
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:19,832
In the end, we're all cigarettes

795
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:24,499
We all gotta burn and die

796
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,708
Its hello, hello, hello, good bye

797
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:33,041
We all gotta burn and die

798
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:37,625
Its hello, hello, hello, good bye

799
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:41,958
What are you doing here?
Come in, please...

800
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,917
The house is a mess... Please come...

801
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:59,000
Are you here to meet me?
Or Jojo?

802
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:01,708
What?

803
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,042
No...

804
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:13,042
You have a friend who is a singer, right?
I think he left his pendrive in my car...

805
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:17,666
But none of my friends are into music...

806
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:21,958
And even if they did,
why will it be in your car?

807
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,625
Oh... yeah...

808
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:30,667
Maybe my junior left it...

809
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,124
Bye.

810
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:34,875
Where are you going?

811
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:38,042
Come inside... Let's have a cup a coffee...

812
01:09:39,125 --> 01:09:40,624
Come on in...

813
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:47,292
Melting candles say happy birthday

814
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:56,708
Melting anger freezes into ice

815
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:05,667
Tears you hold back are
the tears that hurt you

816
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:14,250
In the end, we are all cigarettes

817
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:18,917
We all gotta burn and die

818
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:23,125
Its hello, hello, hello, good bye

819
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:27,583
We all gotta burn and die

820
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:31,875
Its hello, hello, hello, good bye

821
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,124
I'll get going now...

822
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:13,125
Where are you going?

823
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,458
Won't you eat something?

824
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,417
I completely forgot...

825
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:24,417
I have a very important client meeting...

826
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:27,416
You handle the rest...
Have you seen my phone?

827
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,083
It's right there.

828
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:31,166
At least, come for dinner.

829
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:35,083
It's not a big party.
Just a few of his friends.

830
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,458
Actually, Jojo got an offer for a movie...

831
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:46,208
Won't be possible...

832
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:49,875
It's a very important meeting...

833
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:54,875
- I have to go now...
- Please come again...

834
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,000
I'll miss you, Mom...

835
01:11:57,417 --> 01:12:04,375
So much hope is lost, washed away

836
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:12,625
So much hurt gets drowned every day

837
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:21,417
Kurukshetra is finally a street fight

838
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:29,208
Finally, we're all cigarettes

839
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:35,791
We all gotta burn and die

840
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:40,042
Its hello, hello, hello, good bye

841
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:44,374
We all gotta burn and die

842
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:48,791
Its hello, hello, hello, good bye

843
01:12:48,792 --> 01:12:56,458
If you gotta go you better say

844
01:12:57,292 --> 01:13:03,750
If you gotta leave you turn away

845
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:14,000
When the deal is down, you throw your cards

846
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,458
Where are the mugs?

847
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,208
It's there...

848
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,208
Your tidying up will drive me crazy...

849
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,958
Little bit of order is good...

850
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:28,333
I've something important
to discuss with you...

851
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,083
Yeah... Isn't that a great song?

852
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:32,167
What?

853
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,083
That song you're listening to...

854
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:36,500
Yeah, it's good... Very good.

855
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,417
- Whose song?
- I don't know...

856
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:44,750
Mom gave me this pendrive...
Yeah, you're saying...

857
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:49,750
Think hard before you answer.

858
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:52,583
Is it a very tough one?

859
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,375
You're mature enough...

860
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:58,167
Go ahead.

861
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:06,083
I'm much older to you... Right?

862
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:07,708
Right.

863
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:16,333
And you think you love me.

864
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,583
Why? I don't love you?

865
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,833
It's not about love...
Maybe, I can't explain it.

866
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:33,624
What you think is love,
is actually infatuation...

867
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:36,958
- No, I really...
- Let me finish... Please...

868
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,042
Once you're a little
older you'll realise...

869
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:46,417
Love and infatuation are
not the same thing.

870
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:54,042
Infatuation is all about sex and love is...

871
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,833
not all about sex.

872
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:06,917
Somewhere, someone is waiting for you.

873
01:15:09,042 --> 01:15:15,042
Someone who's younger than me...
Someone your age...

874
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:22,292
Because for a man my age...

875
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:26,708
loving you...

876
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:45,833
So...

877
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,917
When do you want me to leave?

878
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:55,417
That's what you think I just said?
That I'm asking you to leave?

879
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:01,125
Not at all... Please stay...

880
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:04,417
Stay as long as you want.
This is your house, too...

881
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:09,458
And you let me know
when you want to go back home.

882
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:13,333
But you have to agree...
That I...

883
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,417
I've never wanted to hurt you.

884
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:24,167
But why are you here?

885
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:27,250
Do you know my mind?

886
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,958
You're not supposed to.
You're very young.

887
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:35,374
Your living in with me...
tidying up my stuff...

888
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,250
Cooking for us...

889
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:41,208
Why are you crying?
Listen to me.

890
01:16:41,542 --> 01:16:44,375
Or you kiss me...

891
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:47,250
This...

892
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:51,582
But this and being a family
is not the same thing...

893
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:55,542
The domestic life is a different thing...
There...

894
01:16:55,750 --> 01:17:00,625
Two people who share a life have to be
in sync with each other...

895
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:02,667
Right?

896
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:06,541
They must understand each other.

897
01:17:06,542 --> 01:17:08,750
So, when you're older...

898
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:19,167
I could save her this time...

899
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:22,458
But she has lost a lot of blood.

900
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:27,374
She needs complete bed rest now.

901
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:30,792
And as far as going to court...

902
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:34,292
Why are you so concerned
about the court?

903
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,166
You're here to treat her.
Why don't you just do that?

904
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:38,374
You saw what happened?

905
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:44,958
I'll give you a certificate for the court.
Let me know if there's any trouble.

906
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:48,458
Ma'am... Ma'am...

907
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,207
- Ma'am...
- What?

908
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,083
Please, come down.

909
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,833
Mala, come downstairs...

910
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:04,625
She was listening to those songs
all night.

911
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:07,708
I've no idea when it happened.

912
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,208
Sorry...

913
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,458
What is that?

914
01:18:37,792 --> 01:18:39,500
CD...

915
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,333
For the last one week...

916
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:50,167
She's been listening to these songs...

917
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,333
How long did she suffer?

918
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,667
Five years.

919
01:18:55,792 --> 01:19:00,458
Can you ask that councillor
to help us?

920
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,208
If we can use the VIP quota...

921
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,374
- Actually...
- Deepak...

922
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:09,249
- We need a small Gita and some honey.
- I have sent Bhola to get it.

923
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:09,958
Okay.

924
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:13,167
Please, see if you can help.

925
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,167
Yeah?

926
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,041
They're saying there's a long queue
at the crematorium.

927
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:20,875
- Oh...
- Can I perform the last rites?

928
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,458
Why?

929
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,750
No, I mean...

930
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:27,333
She was my...

931
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:29,750
Please, let me do it.

932
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:32,000
I know.

933
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:35,250
But I'll do it.

934
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:38,417
I'll come with you.

935
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:44,292
What?

936
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:47,292
Should I inform Rono?

937
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,083
No.

938
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,833
The hearse is here.

939
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:02,000
- Let Jayanto know.
- Okay.

940
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,750
- Please be careful...
- Watch the feet.

941
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:10,125
- Yes, it's okay.
- Get the door.

942
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:12,875
- Careful...
- Slowly...

943
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,250
Let's go, Deepak.

944
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:17,792
You guys accompany the hearse.
We'll come in Deepak's car.

945
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,625
It's going to take some time...
It's very crowded.

946
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,791
- What is she doing?
- She is sitting there...

947
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:27,750
You stay with her.
Call me if you need anything.

948
01:20:53,333 --> 01:21:01,333
Lonely streets, lonely lane

949
01:21:01,667 --> 01:21:08,208
Little hearts, the lonesome pain

950
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:15,041
Lonely homes and lonely families...

951
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:20,875
Another day passes once again

952
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:27,250
Lonely in the market, lonely in the traffic

953
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:33,375
Lonely morning walks everyday

954
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:39,832
Lonely are the lines on
the faces in the cafe

955
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:45,541
More lonely as the sun begins to fade

956
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:51,166
Lonely when you kiss
Lonely when you love

957
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:56,708
Lonely when you sigh and moan

958
01:21:56,917 --> 01:22:04,207
Lonely are the letters lying in the grass

959
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:09,249
Love letters written all alone

960
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:15,957
See the lonely sunlight
falling on your walls

961
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:20,417
Lonely sunlight in the quagmire

962
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:26,958
See the lonely soul, carried down the road

963
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:32,958
Finally... the lonely funeral pyre

964
01:22:56,458 --> 01:23:01,999
Lonely in the protest, lonely in the war

965
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,707
Lonely in the busy downtown

966
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:13,667
Lonely in the rat race when the day begins

967
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:18,792
More lonely when the sun goes down

968
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:23,624
Lonely city, lonely
hearts, loneliness again

969
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:29,375
Lonely tears held back all alone

970
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:35,167
Lonely stars in the lonely sky

971
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:41,042
Burning, burning, burning in vain

972
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:45,667
Rono...

973
01:23:49,542 --> 01:23:52,417
Tell Mala I called you from the office.

974
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,917
Don't tell her I dropped you off.

975
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,250
Got it?

976
01:24:03,042 --> 01:24:04,082
Go ahead.

977
01:24:04,083 --> 01:24:08,332
Lonely is the song of the lonesome singer

978
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:12,832
Lonely is the silence when he's gone

979
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:19,249
Lonely is the train that keeps on rolling

980
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:24,166
Rolling on and on and on

981
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:30,332
See the lonely sunlight
falling on your walls

982
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:34,749
Lonely sunlight in the quagmire

983
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:41,374
See the lonely soul, carried down the road

984
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:46,417
Finally... the lonely funeral pyre

985
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:13,916
See the lonely sunlight
falling on your walls

986
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:18,041
Lonely sunlight in the quagmire

987
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:24,666
See the lonely soul, carried down the road

988
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:31,583
Finally... the lonely funeral pyre

989
01:25:32,708 --> 01:25:34,792
How did you know?

990
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,833
Well...

991
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:43,875
Deepak called me from his office.

992
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:03,458
Why did Sanju become like this?

993
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:07,750
I didn't bring him up properly.

994
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:13,042
That's why he'll rape someone?

995
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,625
Who knows whom he hung out with...

996
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,792
Maybe, if he had a better father...

997
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:27,500
It would have been different.

998
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:33,083
Mala?

999
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:38,250
Ask Jhumu to stay with you tonight.

1000
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:43,167
I have to go to Durgapur for some work.

1001
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:47,667
There's some trouble on site.
Can't tell you for sure...

1002
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:52,333
I'll call you once I get there.

1003
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:56,625
I'm trying to get back by tomorrow...
Okay?

1004
01:26:57,292 --> 01:27:01,417
Take care. Bye.

1005
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:06,208
Damn!

1006
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,208
Oh God!

1007
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:15,667
- One vodka... Neat. Without ice.
- Okay, ma'am.

1008
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:26,625
Sir, your drink...

1009
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,625
Hi.

1010
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,292
Hello.

1011
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,750
Yes.

1012
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:42,208
If you don't mind...

1013
01:27:42,417 --> 01:27:45,875
Can I borrow your phone?

1014
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:54,167
I need to make an urgent call.
My phone's battery died.

1015
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:58,542
Thanks.

1016
01:27:58,792 --> 01:28:01,792
What was the number?

1017
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:12,833
Hello... Hello, can you hear me?

1018
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,874
Can you hear me?

1019
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:22,791
I can't make it today...
Can we meet tomorrow?

1020
01:28:22,792 --> 01:28:25,000
Got stuck in a meeting.

1021
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:28,000
Yes, this is Gargi.

1022
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:31,207
I'm calling you from someone else's phone.

1023
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,832
My phone's battery is dead.

1024
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:35,832
I really can't come today.

1025
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:38,624
I'll meet you tomorrow.

1026
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:41,332
No, no, my client is sitting
in front of me.

1027
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:45,958
How can I speak to you in front of him?
Let's talk tomorrow?

1028
01:28:47,167 --> 01:28:48,625
I am...

1029
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:53,707
Yes, yes... I'll try...

1030
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:57,249
I'll try to set up a Skype call
with the judge.

1031
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,292
Okay... Good night.

1032
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:02,542
Good night!

1033
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:10,125
The call got disconnected...

1034
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,125
Thank you.

1035
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:20,292
We have to lie a lot in our profession...

1036
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,500
Don't judge...

1037
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:27,042
We have to lie too...

1038
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:29,833
Really?

1039
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:35,917
Oh... You...

1040
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,999
What do you have to lie about?

1041
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Where are you supposed to be now?

1042
01:29:44,542 --> 01:29:46,542
At home.

1043
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:54,000
And what have you told them?
Where are you?

1044
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,208
Durgapur.

1045
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,083
Durgapur?

1046
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:07,082
Durgapur is really far.

1047
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:09,666
Don't you think you overdid it?

1048
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:11,542
Engineer...

1049
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,667
Civil.

1050
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:16,917
Lawyer... Criminal...

1051
01:30:18,292 --> 01:30:19,458
Gargi.

1052
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:27,082
Can I buy you a drink?

1053
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:30,458
- Oh no... You can't do this...
- No, it's okay.

1054
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:35,917
I've used your phone.
Now, I'm going to take a cigarette too...

1055
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:39,500
Please, let me get you the drink.

1056
01:30:41,417 --> 01:30:42,917
I have a car.

1057
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I'll drop you wherever you have to go...

1058
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:53,375
Your home...

1059
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,625
I have a car too...

1060
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:02,083
Then, there's no problem at all...

1061
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,458
- Rahul... Two more...
- Yes, sir.

1062
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,750
Why weren't you a good father?

1063
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:21,167
Mala, I...

1064
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:25,667
I wanted to make good music...

1065
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:28,667
I wanted to be famous.

1066
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:32,167
I wasn't able to establish myself...

1067
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:39,625
My music career was going nowhere...

1068
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:48,875
That's why you beat him up?

1069
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:59,292
After Sanju was born, you said
we'll live like hippies...

1070
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,333
Unusual... Extraordinary...

1071
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:11,417
"Nothing ordinary, Mala."
Why?

1072
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:16,083
Is it bad?

1073
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:20,875
Is there something wrong
with being ordinary?

1074
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:29,958
Whatever.

1075
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:36,833
You can say whatever you want today...

1076
01:32:42,542 --> 01:32:45,292
Sanju...

1077
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,500
Do you think Sanju will be released?

1078
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,958
What he has done...

1079
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:06,167
He shouldn't be free.

1080
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,999
See the lonely sunlight
falling on your walls

1081
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,749
Lonely sunlight in the quagmire

1082
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:22,166
See the lonely soul, carried down the road

1083
01:33:22,167 --> 01:33:27,500
Finally... the lonely funeral pyre

1084
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:32,750
Hello...

1085
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,208
Hello...

1086
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,708
Hello...

1087
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:57,083
Thank you.

1088
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:09,875
I'm feeling really bad...
I'm disgusted...

1089
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:15,832
- You have to go to Park Street for the car...
- No, no... It's okay...

1090
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:18,000
- Sorry... Sorry...
- I am fine...

1091
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:21,625
Are you okay?
Bye.

1092
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:30,292
Thank you...

1093
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:34,625
Seriously, thank you... Thank you...

1094
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:38,542
I suddenly lost control...

1095
01:34:39,125 --> 01:34:42,750
I don't drink so much, you know.
And I never behave like this.

1096
01:34:46,917 --> 01:34:50,167
I'm in the middle of a huge problem...

1097
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:56,708
Why? What happened?

1098
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:01,541
I'll lose a case for the first time
in my life.

1099
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:02,917
Why?

1100
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,292
The client refuses to come to court.

1101
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,708
Good night.

1102
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:18,125
- Good night.
- Bye.

1103
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:23,333
Thank you...

1104
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:27,083
Good night.

1105
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:30,292
Take care.

1106
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:04,625
Mala, you...

1107
01:36:06,792 --> 01:36:09,458
You're much younger than me.

1108
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:13,875
You still have a long way to go...

1109
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:17,333
Don't waste...

1110
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:24,250
your life being mad at me
and feeling sad for Sanju...

1111
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:27,292
Deepak is a nice guy, you know...

1112
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:29,750
You should marry him.

1113
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:33,208
Have you come to tell me this?

1114
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,167
Yes...

1115
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:42,417
Yes.

1116
01:36:44,542 --> 01:36:47,167
You know what, Rono?

1117
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:56,125
Marriage is not important.

1118
01:36:57,292 --> 01:37:01,917
The relationship is important.

1119
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:08,917
My relationship with that person
is important.

1120
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:13,292
Anyway...

1121
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:22,708
You take care of yourself too...

1122
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:28,208
Don't drink so much.

1123
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:54,958
Good bye.

1124
01:37:57,167 --> 01:38:01,000
Why did you bring so many things?

1125
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:04,999
You want to cook Indian food,
you'll need ingredients...

1126
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,624
- Have you minced the meat?
- Yup... All done.

1127
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,707
Get me some coffee.

1128
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:12,708
Yeah... But with the song.

1129
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:14,207
What song?

1130
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:17,125
Remember the pendrive you left?

1131
01:38:17,167 --> 01:38:19,542
Jojo's completely addicted to it.

1132
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:23,667
What a terrific song!
Who is the singer?

1133
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:32,625
I don't know.

1134
01:38:34,583 --> 01:38:37,125
I told you the other day...

1135
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:40,583
Bye.

1136
01:38:40,917 --> 01:38:43,500
Where are you going?
What about the coffee?

1137
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:45,542
No... I'll be late.

1138
01:38:45,625 --> 01:38:48,125
So, you're not even going to help me?

1139
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:55,958
I'm sure you'll be able to handle
your own household...

1140
01:38:56,458 --> 01:38:59,667
It's Jojo's birthday, Mom...

1141
01:39:14,792 --> 01:39:19,250
I don't know any of his friends
and I can't cancel the meeting.

1142
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,375
The rape case?

1143
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:24,958
What happened to that?

1144
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:27,833
Nothing.

1145
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:32,791
In all probablity,
the boy will get away with it.

1146
01:39:32,792 --> 01:39:34,792
You can't win it, Mom?

1147
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:37,000
I'll lose...

1148
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:42,875
Take care.

1149
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:51,542
You'd come to our place recently?

1150
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:53,833
Were you there today?

1151
01:39:54,917 --> 01:39:58,125
Please, don't cook.
You're really bad.

1152
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:19,833
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1153
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:25,167
Let's grab a bite...

1154
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:30,542
- We'll go wherever you want.
- Really? Let's go.

1155
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,625
Are you going to change?

1156
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,458
You are looking beautiful...

1157
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:53,500
Oona is happy building her home...

1158
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:56,042
I'm not getting hanged, right?

1159
01:40:57,542 --> 01:41:04,249
Whether you'll get married
or live in is very personal.

1160
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:07,542
But my daughter is not like me.

1161
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:11,583
Career is not very important to her.

1162
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:18,542
She wants to be a home maker...

1163
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:23,208
Thank you...

1164
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,292
I...

1165
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:35,333
I've kissed your daughter
a few times but...

1166
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:39,125
We've never slept together.

1167
01:41:41,125 --> 01:41:45,042
She can pack up her bags anyday
and come back. Be ready...

1168
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:49,333
She has grown up a lot
in the last few days...

1169
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,624
Those linens... Check in the wardrode
on the right...

1170
01:41:54,625 --> 01:41:57,083
Show her those... She'll like it...
I know what she likes.

1171
01:41:57,167 --> 01:41:59,208
Mala... I'm leaving...

1172
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:02,457
Please drop me on your way...
I'll be done in a minute.

1173
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,791
I really can't...
I've to go to Durgapur.

1174
01:42:04,792 --> 01:42:06,457
Please, don't do this...

1175
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:08,582
Why don't you get it?
I have to be at Durgapur...

1176
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:11,249
Hold on... It's just a matter
of 10 mins, Deepak...

1177
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,893
I'm leaving...
Please go on your own today...

1178
01:42:12,917 --> 01:42:15,082
Do you know how many sarees
she buys at one time?

1179
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:16,999
Why don't you get it?

1180
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,875
I'm telling you I have to go to Durgapur.

1181
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:21,750
I'll have to drive in the
opposite direction to drop you...

1182
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:22,583
Go on your own one day.

1183
01:42:22,584 --> 01:42:25,749
When mom was alive,
you always listened to me.

1184
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,333
What changed?
You'll have to drop me.

1185
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:30,500
Mala, I can't. Please...

1186
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:33,167
Don't start a fight when I'm leaving...

1187
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,624
If you can't
then don't stay here.

1188
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:39,374
Go, live in your own house.

1189
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:41,833
I can live on my own...

1190
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:44,625
Fine.

1191
01:42:44,792 --> 01:42:46,375
Hang up... I'm on my way...

1192
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:48,750
I'll leave tomorrow.

1193
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,750
What are you doing here?

1194
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:58,458
Don't disturb her, please...

1195
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,833
I disturb her?

1196
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:03,625
Go on...

1197
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:05,958
Let her rest.

1198
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:08,333
What do you want to say?

1199
01:43:08,792 --> 01:43:10,917
Here, have your medicine.

1200
01:43:11,042 --> 01:43:12,875
Tell me.

1201
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:17,707
Do whatever you wish!

1202
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:19,875
Let me go back to Bangalore.

1203
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:41,667
Why did you grow up so fast, darling?

1204
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:47,958
Is this what you wanted to say to me?

1205
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,167
Gargi was saying...

1206
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,542
If you can Skype...

1207
01:43:56,958 --> 01:43:59,042
with the judge...

1208
01:43:59,125 --> 01:44:00,750
from the court.

1209
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:04,208
I have refused her.

1210
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:07,667
What is the point?

1211
01:44:08,042 --> 01:44:10,792
What's the point of winning the case?

1212
01:44:12,583 --> 01:44:17,333
You're much more important to me
than the case.

1213
01:44:17,708 --> 01:44:20,958
We don't need all this...

1214
01:44:25,542 --> 01:44:28,917
But please don't hurt
yourself again, darling...

1215
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,750
Please...

1216
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:41,292
Madam...

1217
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:44,208
Are we going to lose the case?

1218
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:48,041
Ranjana is not coming to court...
What should we do?

1219
01:44:48,042 --> 01:44:50,083
Will we just give up?

1220
01:44:51,125 --> 01:44:52,792
What will happen then?

1221
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,792
Forget about the case.

1222
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,125
Go home.

1223
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:04,500
Spend some time with your kid.

1224
01:45:04,792 --> 01:45:06,917
He is your son after all.

1225
01:45:07,917 --> 01:45:12,374
We're separated...
And I guess they're happy.

1226
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:14,708
Then you should be happy too...

1227
01:45:15,792 --> 01:45:18,416
Only case, case, case...

1228
01:45:18,417 --> 01:45:22,917
Read a good book, listen to music,
watch a movie...

1229
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:30,333
Go right now and watch a movie...
Get up and go.

1230
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:33,042
- Leave...
- Right, ma'am...

1231
01:45:34,542 --> 01:45:37,374
Did you tell the old man
about the music videos?

1232
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:38,417
Nope.

1233
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:39,917
Why not?

1234
01:45:41,083 --> 01:45:43,417
He won't give us his songs.

1235
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:44,833
What do you mean?

1236
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:47,582
Then he could've done it himself.
Why did he need us?

1237
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,291
He did.
Two of the songs...

1238
01:45:49,292 --> 01:45:51,499
Why did he take us for the other songs?

1239
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:55,791
If we make some money with the video,
what's his problem?

1240
01:45:55,792 --> 01:46:00,083
- These are hit songs. The videos will help us.
- Correct.

1241
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:02,375
We'll get shows. Don't you want that?

1242
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:04,624
Are you going to pay my bills?

1243
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:08,374
What are you trying to say?

1244
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:11,916
What we're trying to say is,
we're all good musicians here.

1245
01:46:11,917 --> 01:46:13,582
But you can't write songs for s***.

1246
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:14,832
That's what we're trying to say.

1247
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,125
What do you mean?

1248
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:20,082
You've no idea about the potential
of the songs we've recorded.

1249
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:23,625
If two or three songs become a hit
then we all make some money.

1250
01:46:23,667 --> 01:46:24,749
Exactly...

1251
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:27,042
He won't give us his songs.

1252
01:46:27,083 --> 01:46:28,167
Or you don't want them?

1253
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:29,333
Why won't I?

1254
01:46:29,417 --> 01:46:33,374
It's simple, boss...
He's cancelled your rent...

1255
01:46:33,375 --> 01:46:36,499
You'll live here rent free...
You don't care about us...

1256
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,541
Why will we sing someone else's songs?

1257
01:46:38,542 --> 01:46:39,666
Why won't we?

1258
01:46:39,667 --> 01:46:43,874
Then what about the posters
on your wall?

1259
01:46:43,875 --> 01:46:44,375
Exactly.

1260
01:46:44,417 --> 01:46:46,833
Put up your own photos...
Can't write a half decent song...

1261
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:51,458
- Hey... Hey... - Hey...
- You guys have played my songs...

1262
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:04,875
What is it?

1263
01:47:06,167 --> 01:47:08,500
You told me that night that...

1264
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:13,083
those songs have become mine.

1265
01:47:14,583 --> 01:47:17,667
You recorded another song, right?

1266
01:47:20,042 --> 01:47:21,167
Right.

1267
01:47:26,667 --> 01:47:29,500
This band is not working.

1268
01:47:30,833 --> 01:47:32,708
It's over.

1269
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,458
I'm going back to Jamshedpur.

1270
01:47:40,042 --> 01:47:44,875
You've already cancelled my dues...

1271
01:47:51,083 --> 01:47:52,583
The only thing is...

1272
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:57,833
I wanted one of the songs
that I've sung...

1273
01:47:58,208 --> 01:48:02,333
The one we recorded that night.

1274
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:06,917
I'm leaving in a day or two...

1275
01:48:18,375 --> 01:48:20,333
See, Arko...

1276
01:48:23,542 --> 01:48:27,875
I can't give those songs to anyone.
No one.

1277
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,750
Sorry.

1278
01:48:33,208 --> 01:48:34,375
Okay.

1279
01:49:05,417 --> 01:49:07,083
Don't hang up.

1280
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:09,749
I know I can't help you.

1281
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,166
I'm going back to Jamshedpur.

1282
01:49:12,167 --> 01:49:14,666
I've sent you a song.
Listen to it if you want.

1283
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:16,917
Otherwise, delete it.

1284
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:34,958
Even if there comes another World War again

1285
01:49:35,042 --> 01:49:41,500
Even if the acid winds blow

1286
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:48,083
Even if the sun melts into the drain

1287
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:54,875
And Himalayas are left with no snow

1288
01:49:55,208 --> 01:50:01,999
Am comin' back... back to your door

1289
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,667
Am comin' back... like I did before

1290
01:50:08,792 --> 01:50:15,708
I know you'll be waitin' on your balcony

1291
01:50:15,833 --> 01:50:22,417
Am comin' back to you once more

1292
01:50:36,833 --> 01:50:43,375
Even if Helsinki turn into hell

1293
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:49,000
Even if Kolkata is buried in snow

1294
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:57,000
Even if the world turns into purple haze

1295
01:50:57,333 --> 01:51:03,417
And the traffic is dead down the road

1296
01:51:03,667 --> 01:51:10,167
Am comin' back... back to your door

1297
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:16,500
Am comin' back... like I did before

1298
01:51:17,042 --> 01:51:24,166
I know you'll waitin' on your balcony

1299
01:51:24,167 --> 01:51:30,708
Am comin' back to you once more

1300
01:51:39,292 --> 01:51:40,500
Ranjana...

1301
01:51:41,375 --> 01:51:43,082
Where are you going?

1302
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44,583
To have a coffee with my friend.

1303
01:51:44,667 --> 01:51:47,667
But in this condition?

1304
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:49,750
I'll go to the court tomorrow.

1305
01:51:49,792 --> 01:51:51,999
And my friend will come with me.

1306
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,832
And after that I'll go to college everyday.

1307
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:56,666
Right now, I'm going out for some coffee.

1308
01:51:56,667 --> 01:52:00,083
- Yes, but...
- Nothing will happen to me, Dad.

1309
01:52:00,667 --> 01:52:02,458
Don't worry about me.

1310
01:52:02,875 --> 01:52:04,458
See you later.

1311
01:52:18,667 --> 01:52:25,916
Everything changes like it always did

1312
01:52:25,917 --> 01:52:32,000
Numbers change. People come and go

1313
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:38,917
Surnames change, you rearrange your hair

1314
01:52:39,375 --> 01:52:44,875
Your body changes underneath your clothes

1315
01:52:46,417 --> 01:52:52,875
The right, the wrong changes,
you don't give a damn

1316
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,542
Your country doesn't matter anymore

1317
01:53:00,167 --> 01:53:06,707
The truth will live on after you have gone

1318
01:53:06,708 --> 01:53:12,125
There's another new morning in store

1319
01:53:13,458 --> 01:53:16,417
I'll be travelling for a few days...

1320
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:21,917
Where are you going?

1321
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:25,333
Haridwar.

1322
01:53:26,125 --> 01:53:27,125
Why?

1323
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:34,333
I haven't gone anywhere in a long time...
Just wanted to get away...

1324
01:53:34,542 --> 01:53:36,708
But the house...

1325
01:53:37,417 --> 01:53:39,583
If you can take care of it?

1326
01:53:39,708 --> 01:53:42,625
I'll leave the keys with you.

1327
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:47,292
Why me?

1328
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,042
Because I have no one else.

1329
01:53:52,333 --> 01:53:55,083
Take them...
I'm not going to become a monk.

1330
01:53:55,333 --> 01:53:56,917
I'll be back.

1331
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:04,000
The song is brilliant.

1332
01:54:05,042 --> 01:54:08,792
I didn't write it.
My landlord did.

1333
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:11,000
But you're singing it.

1334
01:54:12,292 --> 01:54:16,958
Will you come to the court with me?

1335
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:19,458
Me?

1336
01:54:20,667 --> 01:54:24,375
And now, let's go back to your place.

1337
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,167
Your father will kill me.

1338
01:54:28,833 --> 01:54:32,707
No one will say anything.
Will you come with me?

1339
01:54:32,708 --> 01:54:39,499
So am comin' back... to your door

1340
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:45,375
Am comin' back... like I did before

1341
01:54:46,375 --> 01:54:53,042
You may not be waitin' on your balcony

1342
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:59,500
I am comin' back... to your door

1343
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I am comin' back... to your door

1344
01:55:13,708 --> 01:55:20,541
You may not be waitin' on your balcony

1345
01:55:20,542 --> 01:55:26,208
I am comin' back... to your door
