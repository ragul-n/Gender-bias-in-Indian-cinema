1
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,586
What does it mean?

2
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:30,852
I know what it means.
There's just one God

3
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,865
He is the Eternal Truth

4
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,872
Eternal Truth is God

5
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,741
He's the one who does everything

6
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,205
He fears nothing and no one

7
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:56,210
He has no enemies either.
He does not discriminate

8
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:03,147
Just one God, the supreme Lord,
whom nobody can ever defile

9
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:10,155
Nobody can distrust His trust,
His peace, His faith

10
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:16,164
That is God

11
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:25,678
Praise Him, for all is His.
- Hail Lord! Victory is His!

12
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:35,852
Have some oblations. That makes
for a good beginning of the day

13
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:44,198
And Anjali's still asleep...?
Go and wake her up

14
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,380
Wake up...

15
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:06,154
No, as your Papa says,
"Those who sleep, always lose out"

16
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,654
And I don't want
my beautiful daughter...

17
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:13,157
to lose out a single moment
of this glorious morning

18
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,661
so get up, Anjali.
Wake up

19
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,174
Talk to me only in Hindi.
It makes Papa happy

20
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:34,181
Okay, Mama. What's the
time like exactly?

21
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,177
Now don't ask me for the Hindi
translation of "exactly"

22
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,725
Right now, it's 9:30:51

23
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,528
But your classes don't start until
late in the afternoon, do they?

24
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:59,704
So what are you late for?
- Well...

25
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,143
today's friday, Mummy

26
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,345
The latest movie from Bollywood
is being released today

27
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,746
vidhu, shivani and I were
going to catch the morning show

28
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:14,653
The whole of the Indian community must
be there... I'll go with you, too

29
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,487
With you around, my friends are
going to be very reserved!

30
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,160
Really?

31
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:28,500
I know I'm late, but I'll be there
exactly at 10:30, okay?

32
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,666
Who are you talking to?

33
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:37,179
I was talking to shivani, Mama.
Go on now... let me get ready

34
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,849
Wear some nice clothes. The entire
Indian community must be present there

35
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,186
sorry, God, I had to tell a lie
early in the day

36
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:58,196
But this Western mother of mine is
stricter than the Indian mothers

37
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,130
Had I told her who I'm going to really
meet... I would've been in trouble

38
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,952
Hi Indian Raja...

39
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:31,485
Mama says, I must talk in Hindi

40
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,823
superstar of tomorrow

41
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,172
sorry. As your Mama says,
always speak in Hindi

42
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:50,505
Hello sweetheart

43
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:59,685
21 years of age and still
secretly sets out to meet...

44
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,625
her lover, on the sly.
Right?

45
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:10,790
It's girls who come out secretly
that you compose your songs for

46
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,802
If everything were to come out in the
open, where would that leave romance?

47
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:18,134
And without romance...
there's nothing

48
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:23,634
Now tell me something. What'll you do
if your lies are exposed some day?

49
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,644
I'll say I don't recognise you

50
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,644
But I'll still keep coming
to meet you secretly

51
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:32,650
Wow! You seem to be in
a great mood today!

52
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,654
To begin with, you're late.
And you're already talking big!

53
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,161
Whom will I talk big with,
if not you?

54
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,698
Now you tell me... what am
I getting to hear from you today?

55
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,826
Which language would you
like to hear it in?

56
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:50,161
Hindi, English, spanish, Punjabi...?
- Hindi!

57
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,172
In any case, everyone here's going
to understand the language of love

58
00:09:55,344 --> 00:10:02,182
Really? So let me see
how much you love me

59
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,186
"The one I've lost my heart to..."

60
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,186
"is a real sweetheart"

61
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,705
"The one I love,
the one I'm loyal to..."

62
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,698
"is a real sweetheart"

63
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,200
"I want to fondle your tresses..."

64
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:38,703
"I want to gather you
in my arms"

65
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:49,714
"I want to kiss your eyes..."

66
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,218
"I want to dance,
romance you"

67
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,166
"I wish to dream of you..."

68
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:08,159
"I wish to make you mine"

69
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,169
"I wish I could steal you
from yourself"

70
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:15,672
"The one I love has charms
that stand out..."

71
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,186
"she's a real sweetheart"

72
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:38,700
"The one I've lost my heart to..."

73
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,203
"is a real sweetheart"

74
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:32,183
"I have loved you, my love.
I have always waited for you"

75
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:39,190
"Don't look away from me,
for I have trusted you alone"

76
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:50,205
"In your memories, I shall
forever be lost..."

77
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:54,209
"for you, I shall
bear every sorrow"

78
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,878
"for me alone, has God
sent you to earth..."

79
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:01,148
"I could say that
to the whole world"

80
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,156
"The one who holds me
under a spell..."

81
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,651
"is a real sweetheart,
a sweetheart all the way"

82
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,840
"The one I've lost my heart to..."

83
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:27,171
"is a real sweetheart"

84
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:39,684
"The one I love,
the one I'm loyal to..."

85
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:41,686
"is a real sweetheart"

86
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,522
My child... bless you

87
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,686
If you cry, so will Mama and Papa.
And I'll have to follow suit

88
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,698
And here at the canadian airport,
we'll have a tear-jerker...

89
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,200
right out of a Bollywood flick!
- No pleasure in laughing...

90
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:02,462
as there is in crying. So let's
go home and cry all we want to, okay?

91
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:18,475
You're five months pregnant.
And you haven't even told us yet!

92
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,147
And nobody's even got to know!

93
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,494
Half western, you see

94
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:34,159
Or eating the greasy stuff of Delhi,
I'd have looked 10 months pregnant!

95
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,170
Sis, you're my friend. But you can
never be the typical Indian sister

96
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,510
But how could you do this, sis?

97
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:47,182
How could you keep it hidden
from Papa, Mummy and ME?

98
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,512
As if we'd have grudged you
any happiness

99
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,195
We've been married for ten years

100
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,123
But after three miscarriages,
I was so demoralised...

101
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:12,138
that until I reached the
fifth month of pregnancy...

102
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,641
and was sure that I would certainly
become a mother this time...

103
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,815
I didn't want to give you folks
any false hopes

104
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,148
He agreed with me, too.
- "He", I see!

105
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:31,820
Your husband must be thrilled to bits to
see that finally he's becoming a father?

106
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,156
Oh yes, he's very thrilled

107
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:40,499
And despite my pregnancy, he's away
on a world business tour

108
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,171
He'll return just a month
before the delivery

109
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:50,174
But the whole of that one month
will belong only to us, Anjali

110
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,348
Only to us

111
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,290
I'm going to be a grandfather

112
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,256
I'm going to be a grandmother!

113
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,660
You're pregnant,
you've got to be very careful

114
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:43,160
You can't even imagine
how happy I am

115
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:46,166
Look... I'm close to tears

116
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,170
To become grandparents is the
biggest joy in the world...

117
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,641
the biggest joy

118
00:19:55,744 --> 00:20:03,173
I'm eagerly awaiting the day
when I can carry him in my arms

119
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,679
That moment is going to change
our lives

120
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,923
May you live long

121
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:46,725
You're in love with him.
So what's the problem?

122
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,800
You know how Mom and Dad are

123
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,235
And Mama and Papa would want me to
have a husband like yours, right?

124
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:07,178
Leave it to me to convince
Mama and Papa

125
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,178
But I need to be convinced first,
whether the one you've chosen...

126
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:13,555
is right for you

127
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:17,187
I'll give you the only green signal
only after I'm convinced. That's it

128
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:22,523
That's exactly why I've brought you
here. You're going to simply adore him

129
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,201
He loves me very much.
- I'm sure

130
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,199
Mama and Papa will also be sure when
they meet your boyfriend...

131
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,208
in happy circumstances, And that will
be when they become grandparents

132
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:40,211
With the baby cradling in their arms,
they won't refuse you anything

133
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,217
I knew you'd find
the perfect solution

134
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:48,551
come, let me introduce you
to Raja

135
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:55,223
You're right. It's always necessary to
broach every subject at the right time

136
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:57,832
Else, things could go wrong.

137
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:03,270
I don't want things to go wrong for
Anjali and me, for anything in the world

138
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:09,504
Because I know how important
the family is for Anjali

139
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:14,677
Thank you, Raja. I'm glad
you understand...

140
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,178
how much our family means to us

141
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:27,184
When you love someone, you always
want to see her happy

142
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,199
And that's exactly why
I want Anjali to be happy too

143
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:41,206
Whether it has to do with her family
...or me

144
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:48,717
As you know, Raja, I'll be staying
here only till I deliver the baby

145
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:54,218
And I want to see everyplace you
and Anjali visit, sit and chat...

146
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:58,219
and dream of your lives ahead

147
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,325
so what place is that...

148
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:06,493
which two people deeply in love,
consider to be the most beautiful one?

149
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:09,166
Show me.
- Paradise

150
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:12,366
Paradise...?

151
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:19,173
Paradise for him is Beaver Lake.
It's heaven

152
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:26,684
so let's go there and start
our first meeting together

153
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:21,165
Raja, Anjali never told me you
were such a terrific guitarist

154
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,346
But you didn't have any
lyrics for the tune, did you?

155
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:35,520
I composed the tune right now.
Inspired by the surroundings...

156
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,192
and the serenity...
I didn't even think of the lyrics

157
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,696
Your inspiration is right before you.
Lend words to your tune

158
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,668
Now...? Right now?

159
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,306
All right. Let me help you

160
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,708
can you tell me just how much
you love my sister?

161
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,811
I keep telling her that every day.
Let me try something different today

162
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,819
Why don't we make Anjali tell us
how much she loves me?

163
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,223
Oh yes! He's got a point, Anjali!
Give him an answer

164
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,160
As if I am a musician!

165
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:17,327
Look at her making excuses.
- He's right

166
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:20,668
You mustn't make excuses.
To express your feelings...

167
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,635
you don't have to be a musician.
Just say it

168
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:31,340
Okay, just make a beginning.
Later, I'll join you too

169
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:37,675
Oh God! What am I to say now?
- Anything... but please sing

170
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:42,349
c'mon, Anjali.
Bring your feelings to your lips

171
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:52,693
"Whoever cares for
the consequences of love...?"

172
00:25:54,903 --> 00:26:02,139
"We merrily carry on loving"

173
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:24,655
"Whoever cares for
the consequences of love...?"

174
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,159
"We merrily carry on loving"

175
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:38,636
"He's the one I'm crazy about..."

176
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:43,351
"it's his name I keep chanting"

177
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:57,187
"My love for you shall
always be there..."

178
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:01,625
"this much I promise you"

179
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:50,507
"Tis a season for hearts
that thirst..."

180
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,515
"spring, at last, is here"

181
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:04,594
"In your arms,
I want to live..."

182
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:09,133
"I'm going to love my beloved
more than my life"

183
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:18,645
"Life desires only you..."

184
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:23,275
"I give you all I have"

185
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:27,815
"Whoever cares for
the consequences of love...?"

186
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:32,290
"We merrily carry on loving"

187
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:33,154
"Happiness everywhere..."

188
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:37,654
"without him, however,
I feel very lonely"

189
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,657
"Anxiety grips my heart..."

190
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:51,639
"we're expecting
a new guest at home"

191
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:05,183
"Obsessed with the baby,
I live on"

192
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:14,686
"He's the one I'm crazy about,
it's his name I keep chanting"

193
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,703
"As long as there is fragrance
in the roses..."

194
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:01,333
"the air shall be scented"

195
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:10,679
"for as long as
roses blossom..."

196
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:15,184
"my heart shall have
only love for you"

197
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:24,688
"You have no idea
how much I love you..."

198
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:29,200
"it's love alone
that I'm drunk on"

199
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:34,199
"Whoever cares for
the consequences of love...?"

200
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:38,678
"We just keep loving"

201
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:51,782
"He's the one I'm crazy about;
it's his name I keep chanting"

202
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:06,667
"Love shall always be there..."

203
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:11,178
"this much, I promise you"

204
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,657
Don't get to the hospital to see sis.
Ma and Pa are totally stressed out

205
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,262
I don't want them to meet you for
the first time in such circumstances

206
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,302
It's important for me to find
bro-in-law first! Please!

207
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:23,651
Where're you bro-in-law...?
- Right behind you

208
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,190
I thought I'd lost you,
bro-in-law

209
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:42,359
Wonderful. Your Hindi's
gotten to be very good

210
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,706
Looks like you've been watching
a lot of Hindi movies

211
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:48,942
Oh, no bro-in-law!
Actually, that's not true at all

212
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:00,485
Let's pick up those flowers later.
We got to rush, bro-in-law

213
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,657
My missus knows how to take
care of me and herself

214
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:09,595
I've got nothing to do.
I only make money...

215
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,157
and buy my wife her favourite flowers.

216
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:18,297
There's no better trained wife
than Mrs sahni in the whole society

217
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:23,168
This Punjabi guy's trained his wife
in such a way...

218
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,178
she never says anything out of turn.
She remains quiet

219
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:36,856
Bro-in-law...
- Relax, relax

220
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:40,194
I know she's going to be such
a chatter-box after the delivery...

221
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:42,730
I'll have to leave
on a world tour again

222
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:02,807
I think I ought to buy more
than just flowers. Maybe some...

223
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,152
But sis wants to see you
immediately bro-in-law!

224
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,152
Your sis and I have
a perfect understanding

225
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,156
I always get there after she has
herself handled all the tension

226
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,532
Look who is here, papa?

227
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:26,497
Sis...
- Anjali! Listen to me!

228
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,304
Aarti's no more.
My daughter's no more

229
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:41,337
she has left behind a pair of twins.
What's going to happen of them?

230
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:49,516
What's going to happen
of all of us...? What...?

231
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:42,881
It's for you to make
the decision, Anjali

232
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:48,953
We have always let both our daughters
make their own decisions

233
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:53,228
We have always inculcated
in you values...

234
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:56,232
that will make your conscience
and heart tell you...

235
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:59,773
whether what you're doing
is right or wrong

236
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:07,305
In keeping with traditions then,
we want you to make up your mind

237
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:16,520
Whatever you decide,
whether you agree or not...

238
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,717
we will respect your preference

239
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,521
so think, my child.
Take your own time...

240
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:33,366
and only then take a decision.
Because we need to decide something

241
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:52,375
"The ache of love
will never leave the heart"

242
00:42:55,256 --> 00:43:03,163
"for this is an obsession
that cannot be ended even with death"

243
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:14,598
"What world is that, Lord...?"

244
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:25,442
"From which we hear no voice...?"

245
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:37,186
"In love, everything else
is wiped out..."

246
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:42,859
"it's only the yearning
that torments us..."

247
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,205
"oh memories...!
That's all that is left: Memories"

248
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,533
"Your memories..."

249
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,202
"memories are all we have"

250
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:39,911
"Plunging my life in loneliness..."

251
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:45,189
"you have walked out
of my life"

252
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:49,192
"I can take it no more..."

253
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:54,194
"without you,
I won't be able to live"

254
00:45:55,669 --> 00:46:00,003
"Every breath of mine
steeped in pain..."

255
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:05,145
"I can hardly cope
with my anguish"

256
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:26,664
"come now, for I have always
been loyal to you..."

257
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:31,661
"Oh memories...
I have only memories"

258
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,299
"Your memories..."

259
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,169
"memories... all I have"

260
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:19,645
"In memory was the magnificent
Taj Mahal built..."

261
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:25,140
"in memory were penned
the best of poems"

262
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:53,176
"The heart is an ocean in which
blossoms the lotus of our dreams..."

263
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:58,180
"and how we miss
those moments gone by"

264
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:08,127
"You are not here, but
your memories torment me..."

265
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:14,133
"Oh memories...!
That's all we are left with"

266
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:25,137
"Love wipes out
everything else..."

267
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:30,146
"it causes us to pine,
makes us suffer..."

268
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:46,155
"Oh memories...!
That's all we are left with"

269
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,668
"Your memories..."

270
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:51,497
"memories, memories...
they're all I am left with"

271
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,226
You look so beautiful...

272
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:03,668
I wonder why God always takes away
nice people so soon

273
00:51:11,385 --> 00:51:16,186
But tell me, am I really looking
just like my sis?

274
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:24,192
No wonder you took
such a great step!

275
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:28,201
But how sad...!
Isn't it, Manju?

276
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:31,700
I'm told he hasn't been able to
get over his first wife yet?

277
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:39,711
True, Anju. Despite Anjali doing her
best to adapt to things like her sister

278
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:45,214
And look at the age difference.
She's so young!

279
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:48,547
C'mon, Anju!
Aditya isn't old yet

280
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:54,719
I think we must all forget
about our own husbands...

281
00:51:55,429 --> 00:51:59,229
and have an extra-marital affair
with her husband

282
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,869
Look at this one getting scandalised!
- Of course, darling

283
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,501
We are, after all, the ideal
"Indian women"

284
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:12,668
We aren't half Indian,
half western...

285
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:17,172
to already start looking bored,
although lovely and beautiful...

286
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:19,719
in just three years of marriage

287
00:52:22,756 --> 00:52:25,190
If she's so bored in
just three years...

288
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,695
how's she going to spend
an entire lifetime?

289
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:12,668
I...

290
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:19,507
may I serve dinner?
- Yes... do that

291
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:45,704
Is the salt okay?

292
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,275
Yes... it's okay

293
00:53:52,712 --> 00:53:55,203
Will you eat just this much?
Let me serve you more...

294
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,708
No...
I'll take it on my own

295
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:04,314
Have Pooja and Gauri gone to sleep?
- Yes

296
00:54:06,193 --> 00:54:11,290
They go to sleep at nine. They've
got to wake up early... for school

297
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:18,169
Gauri was saying, "Papa arrives
after we've gone to sleep..."

298
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:21,707
"and leaves even before
we have woken"

299
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:30,341
Dad and Mom called from canada today.
- I see

300
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,719
They asked me how you are

301
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:37,690
"How" the two of us are

302
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:39,692
so what did you say?

303
00:54:42,596 --> 00:54:44,188
I said we're all right

304
00:54:48,468 --> 00:54:50,368
They wanted to know when
we're visiting them

305
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:52,530
What did you say then?

306
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:57,376
I said I'd ask you and tell them

307
00:54:57,777 --> 00:55:00,803
Right. I'll give it a try

308
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:06,143
I have so much to do,
but I'll try to find time

309
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,157
What have you done
to yourself?

310
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:20,496
Why...? What do you think of it?

311
00:55:21,868 --> 00:55:28,171
Nice. You were nice even earlier.
You're also nice now, as you are

312
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,458
sis...

313
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:49,520
I'm sorry... if I have disturbed you

314
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:53,351
No, not at all.
Go on

315
00:56:54,894 --> 00:56:58,523
Well... I was just wondering...

316
00:56:58,898 --> 00:57:01,128
if you were having dinner
at home tonight?

317
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:08,264
Yes. I ate dinner at home
last night also

318
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:12,472
Yes... so when will you be back?

319
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,478
Soon... anything else?

320
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:19,185
There's something more

321
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:23,152
It's Teachers' Day at Pooja's
nursery today

322
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,485
There's this diamond set of sis'...

323
00:57:30,397 --> 00:57:32,490
I wondered if I could wear it
and go there...?

324
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:40,628
Of course. It's all yours.
Is there anything else?

325
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:45,172
No... that's all.
That's just it

326
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,853
"It's all yours"

327
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,712
"It's all yours"

328
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:24,942
"How am I ever
going to tell him..."

329
00:58:25,852 --> 00:58:28,150
"how much I love him?"

330
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:32,150
"My eyes wait for him..."

331
00:58:32,525 --> 00:58:35,153
"at heart, I pine"

332
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,494
"Our union will surely happen..."

333
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:43,167
"I have the faith"

334
00:58:51,711 --> 00:58:57,513
"I wait to see him...
at heart, I pine"

335
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:50,503
"When he comes..."

336
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:54,173
"I'm going to take him
in my arms"

337
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:58,177
"I'll do as he says..."

338
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:01,680
"I will not act difficult"

339
01:00:16,996 --> 01:00:19,965
"I'm in a daze..."

340
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:23,700
"what intoxication is this?"

341
01:00:24,571 --> 01:00:30,373
"My eyes wait to see him...
at heart, I pine"

342
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:27,193
"I shall forever be
the Queen of his house"

343
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:34,195
"I'll give him every happiness
and bear all his sorrow"

344
01:01:50,056 --> 01:01:52,217
"I've given him my heart..."

345
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:56,226
"for him, I'd lay down
my life"

346
01:01:57,497 --> 01:02:03,493
"My eyes wait to see him...
at heart, I pine"

347
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:11,171
"How will I tell him
how much I love him?"

348
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:18,180
"My eyes to wait to see him...
at heart, I pine"

349
01:02:19,752 --> 01:02:25,190
"Our union is surely happening,
I have faith"

350
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:38,203
Ram, give me the keys.
I'm driving the car today

351
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:43,197
But the master will be angry, madam.
- No. He won't say anything today

352
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,859
Welcome, Mr sahni, please sit down.
- No thanks...

353
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:47,439
no question of sitting, Inspector

354
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,335
I'll pay whatever losses
have been caused

355
01:03:51,844 --> 01:03:55,211
It isn't about losses, sir.
Someone was about to lose his life

356
01:03:56,015 --> 01:03:59,542
I know. Such negligence
will never take place again

357
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,653
I'm glad the accident took place
in my area...

358
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:06,620
else, your wife would have had to
spend the night in the lock-up

359
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,608
I don't know how it happened

360
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:24,474
But I'll never make such
a mistake again

361
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:34,516
Being sorry doesn't help.
Anyway, you're not driving again

362
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:38,652
Wherever you go, you will
take the driver

363
01:04:42,662 --> 01:04:47,861
But I said I'm sorry.
And it didn't happen deliberately

364
01:04:49,902 --> 01:04:51,870
I promise you,
it'll never happen again

365
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,540
And sis kept driving around for
years... and nothing ever happened

366
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:03,138
Why do you always compare
yourself with your sister?

367
01:05:08,855 --> 01:05:11,323
Why must you always
equate yourself with her?

368
01:05:13,192 --> 01:05:16,161
Why do you keep kidding yourself
that by changing your looks...

369
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:19,828
your appearance and your behaviour,
you will become another Aarti?

370
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:27,161
Remain what you are. Don't ever
try to become Aarti...

371
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:30,609
because you can never be Aarti

372
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:39,508
You don't have to tell me that
I can never be Aarti

373
01:05:41,821 --> 01:05:45,689
Everything you have done in the
last 3 years, everything...

374
01:05:46,926 --> 01:05:49,520
but never ever told me...

375
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:54,526
has been screaming at me and telling me
that I can never replace Aarti

376
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:01,306
Yes, I can never equate
myself with Aarti

377
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,844
But in one respect, I can surely
step into her shoes...

378
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:09,137
something you have perhaps forgotten

379
01:06:11,183 --> 01:06:15,142
she was lonely,
as I am lonely today

380
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:23,160
You didn't have time for her.
And you don't have time for me

381
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:28,490
she led her life,
always waiting for you

382
01:06:31,203 --> 01:06:34,172
And I'm leading my life, too,
waiting for you

383
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,710
she eventually died, waiting for you...

384
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,978
as I will die one day,
waiting for you

385
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:50,518
And like you started realising her
worth only after she was dead...

386
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:56,851
you will perhaps realise my worth
after I'm gone

387
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,131
Because you do not care
for those who live

388
01:07:13,212 --> 01:07:15,646
"she lead her life,
always waiting for you"

389
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:19,146
"And I'm leading my life, too,
waiting for you"

390
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:22,478
"she eventually died,
waiting for you..."

391
01:07:23,556 --> 01:07:25,820
"as I will die one day,
waiting for you"

392
01:07:27,193 --> 01:07:31,152
"And like you started realising her
worth only after she was dead..."

393
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:36,167
"you will perhaps realise my worth
after I'm gone"

394
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,664
Anjali hasn't arrived
with my luggage yet

395
01:08:43,936 --> 01:08:47,167
Actually, we're early sir.
You're always so punctual

396
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,843
she's angry with me.
And rightly too

397
01:08:52,945 --> 01:08:56,176
It's my mistake, Harwinder.
I never really cared for her

398
01:09:04,156 --> 01:09:08,616
When I return from Germany this time,
everything else will take a back seat

399
01:09:09,862 --> 01:09:14,265
My wife, my kids...
my family will take priority

400
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:21,469
I'll take my family on a long
vacation, as soon as I return

401
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:30,439
I'll give my wife this surprise
as soon as I return

402
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:52,495
Well... I have to make a
sudden trip to Germany

403
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:55,707
I couldn't come home, because
there was very little time

404
01:09:56,642 --> 01:09:59,167
so I asked you to pack my bags
and bring them to the airport

405
01:10:09,755 --> 01:10:11,723
I'll try and return soon

406
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:17,517
I'm Ravi sarin and this is...

407
01:11:17,756 --> 01:11:19,519
we're the organisers of your show
in Delhi

408
01:11:19,758 --> 01:11:22,192
There's a lot of excitement in Delhi
over your show of fusion music

409
01:11:24,763 --> 01:11:27,857
We've booked a hotel for your
own accommodation and your troupe's...

410
01:11:28,234 --> 01:11:30,202
as well as for your rehearsals.
Is that okay with you?

411
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,708
You can always call me on my cellphone,
if there's anything you need

412
01:12:06,672 --> 01:12:07,639
Anjali...

413
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,377
hiding from me?

414
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:16,510
Why're you hiding?

415
01:12:17,549 --> 01:12:19,847
What wrong have you done that
you can't look me in the eye?

416
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:25,514
Well, at least you now
meet my gaze

417
01:12:28,294 --> 01:12:32,196
Whom have you come to see off?
I see...

418
01:12:33,365 --> 01:12:36,528
you came to see off the one
you left me for

419
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:38,203
Wait...

420
01:12:48,414 --> 01:12:50,382
I want to meet you

421
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,753
You will meet me, won't you?

422
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:59,554
You will give your old friend
a chance, I hope?

423
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:06,325
I wish to forget you once...
forever

424
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:11,492
As you had forgotten me

425
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:20,668
You'll give me the chance, won't you?
I'll wait for you

426
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:24,778
You'll come, I hope?
