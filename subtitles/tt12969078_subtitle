00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
Ya Thanks..

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,600
Hmm.. Hmm..

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,360
Ok

7
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,080
Yeh..

8
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
There is an important courier from INDIA

9
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,640
Bart I will call you right back?.

10
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,320
Thank You..

MY DEAR FRIEND GUDDU..

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
A GIFT FOR YOU

14
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,960
Seeing him get down from the bus every day

15
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,480
had become a ritual

16
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,360
He was different from the rest.

17
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
Every breath of his emanated rhythm

18
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Music would always find him

19
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,400
or he would find it somewhere somehow

20
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,480
He would always remain silent

21
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,400
but his hands always conveyed a lot more

22
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,800
The noise , the regular daily noises

23
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,800
would be music to his ears

24
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,600
They say that the sounds of the world work in sync

25
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
and he would always create beats to match
these sounds of the universe ..

26
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,040
Music was his happiness..

27
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
And ‘Tansen Music Academy’ was his dream

28
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,560
Tiwari Tea Stall

29
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,640
Oh hello!

30
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,560
Please have mercy on the glasses!

31
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,400
They are fragile!

32
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,960
Go and give tea

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,320
What are you smiling at ?

36
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,080
Tea

37
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,520
So keep it here and get out

38
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,040
Go, we will send the cups back to Tiwari’s

39
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,400
Tiwari said that I should get the glasses back with me

40
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,760
Why? Are Tiwari’s glasses extra special?

41
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
(Laughter)

42
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
I know exactly why he always hovers around.

43
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,800
He thinks he is like us

44
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Try your luck elsewhere.

45
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,960
Musicians are born not trained

46
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,480
Be careful, so that the opportunity is not gone

47
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Do not take the world only as a dream

48
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
When has a good effort gone waste?

49
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Be the guide of your own path

50
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,160
God of the world is your refuge

51
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,680
You are a human, do not lose heart!

52
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,520
You are a human..........

54
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,480
What is the meaning of musician?

55
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,480
Musician?

56
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,000
In French it’s called 'Musicien'

57
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
in Italian 'Mujista'

58
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,880
German 'Musiker'

59
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
in Russian it's 'Muzykant

60
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,080
Sanskrit 'Sangeetagya'

61
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,480
and in Hindi

62
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,760
it is 'Sangeetkar

63
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,480
all of this means 'Musician'

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
I don’t even know the spelling of a musician

66
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,320
Look at this, this is a balloon.

67
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,440
Does the balloon know it’s own spelling?

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No ...

69
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,760
But it still knows

70
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,920
how to fly ..

71
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
My bus is here !

72
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
Who is making that noise!

73
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,320
Do you know,

74
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Those young Orchestra guys have some amazing musical
instruments

75
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,000
And they play just like the songs that we see on television!

76
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Brother

77
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,560
don’t go there! Father will beat you up!

78
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Why?

79
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Shouldn’t even go and deliver tea there!

not like this.

114
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,680
not like this.

115
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,560
Dance like a film heroine

116
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,280
show us moves.

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,280

My father has asked for some money in advance

128
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,000
Why?

129
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,120
Can’t you guys wait for two more days.

130
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,240

So...

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,960
Then take away...

135
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,000
But Listen your father is going to blow away that money in
his drinking

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,800
can you please give it now.

137
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,880

I will not come to work from tomorrow

145
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,880
Why? Now what has happened?

146
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,400
Your father is sending you to that big ’Tansen Music
Academy’ ?

147
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:40,920
Why..?

148
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,960
You don’t think I can go to ’Tansen Music Academy’’ ?

149
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,560
People like you and your father will never make it.

150
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
Stop dreaming.

151
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,280
And come to work on time tomorrow

152
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,520
I no longer work for you

153
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,880
Look at the way he is talking..!

154
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,160
Your father is right.

155
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,560
You are just like your mother who ran away

156
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,680
You can’t be trusted

157
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,120
Stop! I will teach you a lesson

158
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,160

162
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,960
You know tomorrow

163
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,600
I will get to touch all those musical instruments,

164
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,880
take care of them and play them.

165
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,120
What instruments ?

166
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Nothing... you go to sleep

167
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,400
..the last song was so enjoyable..

168
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,920
Give, I will carry these for you.

169
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,120
Don’t touch it.

170
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,120
It’s very expensive.

171
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,520
Go get tea.

172
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
I know my work

173
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,120
Should I get tea from around the corner?

174
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,920
Look at him

175
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,760
He works for Tiwari

176
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,320
but will get us tea from another place

177
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,840
I used to work at Tiwari

178
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,520
Now I work for you all

179
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,920
Don’t have such notions.

180
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,400
You are of no use to us

181
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,400
Will you leave or should I call Tiwari

182
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,120
You only confirmed my job yesterday!

183
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,160
Let’s keep him guys

184
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
He might prove to be be useful

185
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,320
You know he has fidgety fingers.

186
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,640
If he breaks something, who will foot the bill?

187
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,360
I promise I won’t touch any instrument

188
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
I will do whatever you say

189
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,560
I will sweep this place

190
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,560
Please give me work

191
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,600
leave us alone.

192
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,800
I left Tiwari’s job

193
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,520
I came the second time around too to confirm!

194
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,800
How is work?

195
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,920
I shouldn’t get any complaints about you..

196
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,400
I spoke to Tiwari a few days back

197
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,800
He will increase your salary

198
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,600
Everything has become so expensive now a days
especially alcohol..

199
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,000
Lata, let’s go next door to Aunty’s house

200
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,000
Do you have a job opening here?

201
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,480
Try next month...
Don't have for now

202
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,000
Or go to that shop.. there.

203
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,240
Go and ask there...Ok

204
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,040
Now a days keeping these children on work
is very difficult

205
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,560
These Child Labor Organizations create a lot of issues

206
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,760
There is no work there

207
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,280
Can’t you give some job now?

208
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,080
I just said...

209
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,560
There is no work

210
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,840
Go!

211
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Do you have any work for me?

212
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,120
No. Leave from here!

213
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,720
Do you have any work for me?

214
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,760
No.. No...

215
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
Chotu leave that

216
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,840
go deliver this tea

217
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,480
What happend? why are you looking so stressed

218
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,840
Something is up.. you were so happy yesterday

219
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,760
My money??

220
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,440
Hey stop! Thief!

221
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,520
Beggar !

222
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,680
Guddu!

223
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,040
What happened?

224
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,600
I am desperate for work

225
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,760
Meet me tomorrow morning

226
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,320
Let me try and help

227
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,600
‘Old hindi song’

228
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,840
Is it real?

229
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,160
Stop! Stop!

230
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,960
Stop! you left your things behind

231
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,520
‘Tansen Music Academy’

232
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,400
Please follow me. You have been called inside

233
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,440
I am sorry

234
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,080
but your experience is not enough..

235
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,480
Sorry, we can’t appoint you as a Music Teacher in our
school.

236
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:59,360
Sir, I have sang in chorus for 40-50 Hindi films.

237
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,240
I am trained as well

238
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,960
If you can look at my certificates

239
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,680
OK. Submit all your details to Mishra ji outside.

240
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,760
If anything opens up, we will be in touch.

241
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,000
Thank you

242
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,920
She is quite talented

243
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720
You know the situation the School is in

244
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,760
The National competition which helds in our school

245
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,280
we get the grants because of these

246
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,160
Our school survives on these grant

247
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,280
And we have are losing this competition for the last 4 years

248
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,800
If our children lose this year as well

249
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,880
we will lose the grant

250
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,880
We will have to shut down

251
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,600
How long will this go on

252
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,800
I am retiring this year

253
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,040
I have to ensure that we win this competition this year, by
all means!

254
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,880
Think of some solution

255
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,240
Separate the metals properly

256
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,960
Hey, why are you sitting idle

257
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Keep plastic with plastic

258
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,080
Brother

259
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,360
This is Guddu

260
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,480
I have seen him somewhere

261
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,320
Where...?

262
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,680
Work here at the scrap shop?

263
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,080
What is wrong in this work?

264
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,560
It’s no less than a jeweller’s job.

265
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,360
A jeweller can spot a diamond from far

266
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,560
And we can spot valuable things in our scrap yard!

267
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,240
I am going to pay you rupees 1000 per month

268
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,720
Won’t pay more!

269
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,960
Work with dedication here, Guddu

270
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Start work tomorrow

271
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,080
Why tomorrow?

272
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,160
Is my shop shut today?

273
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,680
Ok, I will begin right away

274
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,160
Good, now you’re talking like a jeweller

275
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,560
Hey come here,

276
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,200
take him with you and teach him the work

277
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,240
Come son

278
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,960
His name is Guddu

279
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,960
Thanks Brother. How is work?

280
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,600
All good. How is your music coming along?

281
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,560
What are you doing

282
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,280
Every metal makes a different sound

283
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,200
I am segregating each metal on the basis of it’s sound

284
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,400
Can I take these ?

285
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,520
What will you do with these?

286
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,600
the books are for my friend and this is for me

287
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,280
Brother, where are the people who used to stay here ?

288
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,880
They left long back...

289
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,920
Why has Tiwari not given you the payment so far?

290
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,480
He said he will give it in a couple of days

291
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,440
Brother

292
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,400
Brother...Brother

293
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,520
Brother, look that guy who gave us 100 rupees that day

294
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,160
How does he get that kind of money?

295
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,240
Let's go...

296
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,040
He works at this scrapyard?

297
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,240
This seems to be a well paying job

298
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,800
I did not steal anything

299
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,720
So where is that expensive plate and pot?

300
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,680
Don’t look here and there ..answer my question!

301
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,640
Listen everybody, look at him

302
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,040
I thought he was special but he turned out to be a thief!

303
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,840
I’m telling the truth I did not steal anything

304
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,040
If I see you standing here for another minute I shall call
the cops.

305
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,400
Get out of my sight.

306
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,040
Run off!

307
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,440
Get back to work everyone!

308
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:51,200
Prayer chantings

309
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:46,320
Famous bollywood song

310
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,120
Brother

311
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,320
Where did you get these from?

312
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,360
How does it matter to you?

313
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,560
I know you took them from my shop

314
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,200
You think I am a thief? I bought them

315
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,360
You better return my things to me

316
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,520
Try and even touch my things, I will break your hands

317
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,480
I am taking my things with me

318
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,800
Leave my things

319
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,360
Leave my things

320
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,120
Brother, watch out

321
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
Brother, watch out

322
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,680
Guddu bhaiya leave!

323
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,480
Chuttan, Guddu stop!

324
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,000
Chuttan, Chuttan stop!

325
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,480
Chuttan, No!

326
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,040
Why are you two fighting like mad people

327
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,760
Madhav. I lost my job because of him.

328
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,520
You know how difficult it was for me to get that job.

329
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,520
He came and stole things from my shop and they fired me

330
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,360
I’m really going to beat him up

331
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,840
Where in Orcha?

332
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,440
See, I told you!

333
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,720
These are my things!

334
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,280
I will not give these back!

335
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,600
Then, I’m calling the police!

336
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,400
Chuttan, why are you getting so angry?

337
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,920
You actually stole his things.

338
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,160
You have no idea with how much difficulty Guddu got this
job.

339
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,000
The whole household runs on Guddu’s salary.

340
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,760
Whatever his father earns

341
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,040
he spends it all on his drinks

342
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,040
So, do one thing.

343
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,880
Tell him to work with me.

344
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,280
He can make some money too while performing with us.

345
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,720
I am not a beggar. I don’t need to work with you.

346
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,880
You played at the scrap dealer’s place too!

347
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,240
Ok, stop fighting .

348
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,320
Let us return the things you took from his boss

349
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,720
What do you think?

350
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,600
You will return the stolen goods and I will take you back?

351
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,920
So that you can gain my trust and steal again?

352
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,120
I did not steal

353
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,840
Guddu is not a thief

354
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,960
Go inside and see what kind of work he was doing

355
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Life gives you only one chance.

356
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,040
And you lost it.

357
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,440
Now leave from here

358
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,160
Come inside, I will show you what he was building

359
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,240
Come .. See..

360
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,400
Wow

361
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,960
Look , if you join hands with them, every one can earn good
money

362
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,960
You mean, beg with them?

363
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,760
No, these two don’t beg. They sing and dance to entertain

364
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,000
Think again.

365
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,960
What if we make our band ?

366
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,360
I can also join you three.

367
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,480
Then none of us would have to beg!

368
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,640
Yes, Guddu brother , come, let us show you our place

369
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,040
No, not now.

370
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,440
You know what Mangu Uncle would say..’No guest allowed’!

371
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,680
Don’t worry.

372
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,280
I will speak to Mangu Uncle

373
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,160
Come Guddu

374
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,480
This is our palace

375
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,440
isn't it nice !!

376
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,080
You all live here

377
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,280
Yes, Guddu brother.

378
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,800
See , that’s my corner.

379
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,240
And these are my dolls

380
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,400
And this must be Madhav’s spot

381
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,880
And who's corner is this ?

382
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
This Corner ... Come here...

383
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,360
This Corner is mine

384
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,160
So many notes here

385
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,760
I fall asleep looking at these notes.

386
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,880
Try it sometime

387
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,760
Stick the money on the ceiling and you will sleep well just
gazing at them

388
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,320
And that?

389
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,880
That belongs to Mangu Uncle

390
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,760
Mangu Uncle ??

391
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,240
So kids,

392
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,280
what’s happening here?

393
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,480
Who is he?

394
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,360
Let’s do one thing.

395
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,960
Let us cut his hands

396
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,840
We will have variety with us

397
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,000
Get 2-4 more kids like him and we will be rich

398
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,440
Mangu uncle, he is our friend

399
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,280
Guest..Guest!

400
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,040
Guddu

401
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,560
Guddu or Buddu, I don’t care.

402
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,840
I told you not to get anyone here.

403
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,600
So ... why you got him here !!

404
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,360
Strictly ‘no guests allowed’ Understood ..

405
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,560
This is?

406
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,840
Graveyard

407
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,960
..meaning?

408
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,760
Listen, when Christians die, they bury them here..

409
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
You don’t get scared here?

410
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,760
Why should we be scared?

411
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,440
This is where we chill out..

412
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,120
Bet you are afraid!

413
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,480
So, what have you thought?

414
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,800
About what

415
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,080
About BAND

416
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,680
Let us make our own orchestra!

417
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,840
We’ll make lots of money!

418
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,280
Yes, Guddu Brother, it’s going to be so much fun

419
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,280
Ok, then I have a condition

420
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,360
What?

421
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,920
You have to do as I tell..

422
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,280
Ofcourse! Tell us..

423
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,880
We have to work very hard

424
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,720
Ofcourse! Tell us..we will do

425
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,040
So, what shall we call our orchestra

426
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,840
Atkan Chatkan

427
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,000
That’s perfect! Atkan Chatkan!

428
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,720
Come come!

429
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,800
Guddu come...

430
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,200
ATKAN CHTAKAN!!

431
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,640
Marbles, gully cricket, playing catch

432
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,080
Marbles, gully cricket, playing catch

433
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,560
All the beloved pastimes of our childhood

434
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,840
We have foregone

435
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,000
But as we beat these tin drums

436
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,640
But as we beat these tin drums

437
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,000
We forge a new tune for us

438
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,640
Who will be write lyrics? tell us we don't have the
knowledge...

439
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,160
But of course, he will write!

440
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,640
Madhav, Madhav will write it for us

441
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,920
Come on Madhav, surely you will?

442
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,320
Let me think...!

443
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,560
Atkan Chatkan

444
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,000
In these halcyon days of our childhood

445
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Where we have neither a home, nor a car

446
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,800
We still feel like kings

447
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,120
In these halcyon days of our childhood

448
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,480
Where we have neither a home, nor a car

449
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,800
We still feel like kings

450
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,960
Our hearts roam free like mavericks

451
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,600
Bright shining stars in a boundless blue sky

452
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,960
We don’t know how to spell

453
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,440
But we still have something to say

454
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,440
Guddu, Mitthi, Madhav, Chuttan

455
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,520
All we need we have found with each other

456
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,160
Though the steps we take are small

457
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,400
We remain undeterred in our pace

458
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,920
Though we have no means to fly

459
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,200
We continue to dream big

460
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,400
If only someone were to grant me a wish

461
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,640
I would ask for my favourite dish

462
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,680
Not that silly! Dish as in food!

463
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Though the steps we take are small

464
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,040
We remain undeterred in our pace

465
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,560
Though we have no means to fly

466
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,640
We continue to dream big

467
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,800
Ah to think that someday soon

468
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,760
How everyone will praise us

469
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,040
Once they hear about the travails of our journey

470
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,160
By doing all that we could

471
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,320
Under the boundless blue sky

472
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,880
Atkan Chatkan
Dahi chatokan

473
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,200
In these halcyon days of our childhood

474
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,520
Where we have neither a home, nor a car

475
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,840
We still feel like kings

476
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,160
Our hearts roam free like mavericks

477
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,040
Bright shining stars in a boundless blue sky

478
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,120
We don’t know how to spell

479
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,800
But we still have something to say

480
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,800
Why have we come here ?

481
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,760
Wait a little..

482
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,720
Look. That’s my dream..

483
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,960
..And the girl of my dreams.

484
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,760
You know , I used to also beg like Mithi and Chuttan

485
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,600
Then I thought, I should buy a wheelchair with my own money

486
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,600
After all, money earned from begging has no dignity

487
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,080
Just think, what if she sees me begging?

488
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,480
What will she think of me!

489
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,560
That is why I must earn money

490
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,520
uncle...

491
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,760
Vyju brother.

492
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,240
Brother...

493
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,840
I am looking for my Family

494
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,160
Please tell me where are my kids ...

495
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,440
I’ve been searching for days.

496
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,440
By the grace of God, I found you today

497
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,560
Sister..

498
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,360
Why are you hesitant? has my husband remarried again?

499
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,280
No sister, that is not the case

500
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,880
Vishnu brother hates anything to do with music now

501
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,400
And he hates you even more.

502
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,240
Please make me meet my kids somehow. Just once.

503
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,720
I beg you..

504
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,320
It’s not easy sister.

505
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,480
How can he possibly let go of the anger of years so quickly?

506
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,080
Give me some time.

507
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,360
How is the preparation going on?

508
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,840
We still have a month to go, Sir.

509
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,520
We provide you the best teachers, instruments and yet we
keep losing.

510
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,600
Only if you all are well prepared, you will be permitted to
participate.

511
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,720
We cannot afford to lose this at any cost

512
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,760
Be serious.

513
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,560
work hard

514
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,120
Hopefully, you will only represent the school

515
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,280
‘Hopefully’ you will represent?

516
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,000
Meaning?

517
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,000
He is trying to psych us.

518
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,680
We are his only option.

519
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,680
Who else has he got to represent the school?

520
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,880
Their music is very different..

521
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,720
Wasn’t I right about them?

522
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,440
Find out who are they and
where they came from

523
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,120
Go ahead. Eat.

524
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,320
Kid's I have a good news for you..

525
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,600
Good news?

526
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,800
Yes, we have a big music competition coming up in our school
next month

527
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,840
Mujik kumpeter?

528
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,320
Music competition!

529
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,440
Yes.

530
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,720
Means.. Singing Competition..

531
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,760
The best schools from all the states of India
will be coming to our school to compete.

532
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,520
And we are giving YOU the opportunity to participate !

533
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,720
An opportunity to play music for Tansen Music School!

534
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,720
All that is fine but what’s in it for us?

535
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,400
The best team wins a prize

536
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,120
How much?

537
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,080
All of us?

538
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,360
But how can we?

539
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,800
We don’t study there.

540
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,960
Children you don't worry about that

541
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,920
We have given it a lot of thought.

542
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,840
Yes, we get that but how much money will we make?

543
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,680
We have to pay Mangu his cut

544
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,320
You will win Rs 51000

545
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,640
51,000!!

546
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,120
And if we lose?

547
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,360
Children

548
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,000
you are different.

549
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,600
Your music is special.

550
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:07,480
Just give it your best shot and
the prize will certainly be yours.

551
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,360
And along with it, we will give you the
opportunity to learn music in our school

552
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,320
You mean, we will get to wear a school uniform!

553
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,480
That Yellow School Bus?

554
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,640
Kids, prepare well.

555
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,440
Reach the school at 12pm tomorrow

556
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,880
Enjoy your meal

557
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,600
That school with the yellow bus

558
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,480
Hey, where are you going?

559
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,880
Where is Dsouza?

560
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,760
Tell him we have come

561
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,760
He means, Principal Dsouza Sir has called us

562
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,800
DeSouza Sir?

563
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,120
Just wait here only...

564
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,200
cool down

565
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:19,560
Mishra ji, some street urchins are here at the gate.

566
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,840
Principal Dsouza has lost his mind

567
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,240
Look, seems like they will build a rocket

568
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,880
Ms Mohi, please wait in the office for me

569
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,720
Yes

570
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,000
Did you watch them?

571
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,560
Hope you understand now what’s best for the school.

572
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,680
You want to represent the school?

573
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,600
Then perform better than these kids.

574
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,280
Officially I can’t appoint you,

575
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,560
I would appreciate if you can help train these kids off the
record

576
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,120
They are orphans from the street

577
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,440
and have to be prepped to represent
our school in the music competition

578
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,240
You just have to show them the way.

579
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,160
Because when it comes to music,
it’s a world they understand well

580
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,640
And please keep this confidential.

581
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,800
Kid's... come.. come...

582
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,480
Kids, this is your teacher, Mohini ji

583
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,920
Mohini ji

584
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,080
this is Madhav

585
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,280
Chuttan

586
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,600
Mithi

587
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,280
and Guddu.

588
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,760
Do Namaste, Kids

589
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,080
You have to train them

590
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,080
And children, you have to go to her place
for training tomorrow onwards.

591
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,920
I have to participate in the competition
and win it

592
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,480
But what will happen if PAPA finds out?

593
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,640
You know what you are being prepared for?

594
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,160
You know how big this competition is?

595
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,880
It’s not very easy to sing and play music in this
competition

596
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,840
Madam, this has been Guddu‘s dream for ever

597
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,960
that's very good

598
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,200
Do you think we’ll be able to win this competition?

599
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,680
Don’t talk such depressing talks or
I will throw you in this river!

600
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,040
You certainly were a butcher in your previous birth!

601
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,680
Don’t worry guys, Mohi Madam will teach us well.

602
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,720
But what are we going to tell Mangu uncle

603
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,840
We have even run out of cash

604
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,600
where is it ?

605
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,080
Aah, found this

606
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,200
And this..

607
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,880
This is my 20

608
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,320
got it, got it

609
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,880
Mangu uncle

610
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,240
Seems like

611
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,760
something is amiss here.

612
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,280
it seems you are hiding something from me..

613
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,400
Where did you all disappear for the last few days?

614
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,960
And where is my commission?

615
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,240
So, you guys want tell me anything?

616
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,120
I will break your hands and legs.

617
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,720
No no.
Here take this ..

618
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,720
please don't beat us

619
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,440
Why is it so less?

620
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,280
I smell something fishy here.

621
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,840
No, Mangu uncle, no

622
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,200
And you ..

623
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,200
Listen carefully..

624
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,520
If you don’t give your share of the
commission to me next time,

625
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,960
I better not see you around my kids.

626
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,360
Last warning to you.. Understood ?

627
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,160
Sir this is the admission file for all the four kids

628
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,240
Keep an eye on our kids as well.

629
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,480
We just have a few more days left for the competition.

630
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,480
Ok Sir..

631
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,400
The theme of the competition this year is ‘poems’

632
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,320
Do you know any poem
that everybody would love?

633
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,040
Madhav what about the poem
that you recite all the time?

634
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,320
Which one?

635
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,560
Hey human, don’t lose heart

636
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,120
Hey human, don’t lose heart

637
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,520
Hey human, don’t lose heart

638
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,440
Do some work, do some work!

639
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,280
Living in this world create your name..

640
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,840
(Screaming)

641
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,240
That ssssssssss?

642
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,000
That’s a pressure cooker.

643
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,520
The Principal is making a mistake

644
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,280
Correct

645
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,240
This is not done

646
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,840
Now beggars are going to sing in our school ?

647
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,120
Principal is sidelining us because of these beggars.

648
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,600
We will sideline them instead

649
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,760
Reading books everyone died..

650
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,120
none became any wise..

651
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,160
The one who reads the words of love..

652
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,000
He freezes every time he sees her!

653
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,280
Excuse me

654
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,360
Who is there.. wait....

655
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,240
I’m sorry I left.

656
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,520
I can’t live without the kids.

657
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,760
Can I please see my kids

658
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,080
You want to meet the kids?

659
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,080
Get out!

660
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,680
You have spoiled my life.

661
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,520
Leave!

662
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,160
Please..

663
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,360
Please...Please...

664
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:58,360
If I see you again anywhere nearby I will break your legs

665
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,040
She want's to see kid's now

666
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,200
After years she remembers now..

667
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,600
Sister

668
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,360
are you alright?

669
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,120
You have come back after so many years

670
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,320
Just go for now

671
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,960
Please go.

672
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,200
Or else he will come back

673
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,600
What are you staring at?

674
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,400
Don’t even think of touching this instrument!

675
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,680
I will break your hands

676
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,720
Go now...

677
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,160
Cursed woman left us

678
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,240
And now she wants to take the kids with her

679
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,760
Selfish woman!

680
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,960
Brother, how is the new teacher?

681
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,240
She is very kind and treats us lovingly

682
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,800
Just like the Aunty next door?

683
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,400
Better than the aunty next door

684
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,920
Will you make me meet her?

685
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,920
Ok ?enough fun now.

686
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,760
Let’s start for the day?

687
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,240
Why isn’t Guddu here yet?

688
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,480
I hope he remembers the competition is tomorrow.

689
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,960
Madam, maybe his bus is delayed

690
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,120
Bus?

691
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,200
Doesn’t he live with you all?

692
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,480
No..

693
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,520
he comes from Jamuniya

694
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,200
Jamuniya?

695
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,280
Sorry, Madam. The bus got delayed.

696
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,600
And Lata also walks slowly

697
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,120
Madam?

698
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,680
Let’s start?

699
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,520
Madam?

700
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,200
Yes..

701
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,280
Let’s start?

702
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:52,920
Children (singing)

703
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,560
Ok listen to me....

704
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,000
I think you should all take a break

705
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,760
Come early tomorrow

706
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,000
Take your instruments with you

707
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,800
Practice later at home too

708
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,400
Tomorrow is a very important day for all of us

709
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,120
Come on .. Come on .. lets go

710
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,440
Take this Chuttan... Hold this also...

711
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,440
Madam, this is my sister, Lata

712
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,120
She had a school holiday today

713
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,600
..so I got her with me

714
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,880
Lata, say ‘namaste’ to Madam ji

715
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,520
Namaste

716
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,560
Guddu

717
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:54,720
Yes?

718
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,600
Come here...

719
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,760
Are you...

720
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,680
You are from Jamuniya?

721
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,960
Where in Jamuniya?

722
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,280
The street by the hand pump

723
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,680
What is your father’s name?

724
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,920
Vishnu

725
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,000
And mother’s name?

726
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,040
I am your mother, Guddu.

727
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,800
Listen

728
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,600
Lata, come!

729
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,120
Guddu, what happened?

730
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,600
Say something.

731
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,160
We will not have anything to do with her.

732
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,320
Who?

733
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,480
Mohi Madam?

734
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,440
Did she say something to you?

735
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,600
I said , we will not go to her anymore

736
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,600
None of us, ok?

737
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,880
Speak for yourself.

738
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,480
We will definitely go to her.

739
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,440
Stop being our Boss

740
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,080
Chuttan, calm down

741
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:35,960
What’s wrong in what I am saying?

742
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,760
What do you think of yourself.

743
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,000
Guddu.....

744
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,520
You are some big ‘music’ or what?

745
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,680
Lata!

746
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,600
Guddu.. wait

747
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,640
Guddu, what has happened all of a sudden?

748
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:53,440
We promised

749
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,800
Guddu.. wait

750
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,120
Guddu.. wait .. Don't go...

751
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,560
Madhav...What happen?

752
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,080
Have you seen any kids around?

753
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,320
Kids?

754
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,800
Everyone is a grown up now.

755
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,080
Guddu?

756
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,160
Guddu?

757
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,760
Don’t take his name.

758
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,760
He is the reason behind all this mess.

759
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,360
Just tell me where he is

760
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,200
and I will take care of him

761
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,360
So, it’s you?

762
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,040
I should have known.

763
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,520
How else would my kid suddenly change?

764
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:15,000
You left us and now want Guddu to do the same?

765
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,920
You have come here to take my kid?

766
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:25,440
If I find you anywhere near my kids,
you will regret it.

767
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,240
understood?

768
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,160
my son lied to me!

769
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,760
Watch where you are going.

770
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,880
Isn’t that Madhav?
Where is he going?

771
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,840
Madhav?

772
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,040
you wait here

773
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:11,480
I didn’t leave my kids, Sir

774
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,200
I was young

775
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,840
..and weak

776
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,800
I was just 16 or 17

777
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,440
when I met Guddu’s father.

778
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,840
He was a great Pakhawaj player.

779
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,560
I had come from Chennai to perform...

780
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,160
With him

781
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,600
That’s how we fell in love.

782
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:20,440
Gradually, people started
appreciating my singing more.

783
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,920
People started praising me more.

784
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:31,000
He took a backseat.

785
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,840
Why are you drinking again?

786
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,880
Don’t touch the Pakhawaj when you are drunk.

787
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,720
It’s disrespectful to our music.

788
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,440
stop this

789
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,240
why ?

790
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,680
This is my house

791
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,200
I will do whatever I want

792
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,720
You sing well.

793
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,640
Go sing somewhere.

794
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,880
What is this...

795
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,520
Put the bottle down!

796
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,680
Where are you going ?

797
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,720
Where are you taking my kids?

798
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,880
NO.. NO .. please ..

799
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,520
give her to me

800
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,160
please give me my children

801
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,200
go become a big singer

802
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,480
take your stuff

803
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,120
shown your true colors

804
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,200
I cried, I begged.

805
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,120
He didn’t give me my children

806
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,760
nor did he ever let me back in the house.

807
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,720
I thought of killing myself

808
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,960
But the hope of seeing my kids again kept me alive

809
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,760
Guddu had been coming to me for days

810
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,600
and I couldn’t recognize him.

811
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,200
And today, when I finally found him,

812
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,000
my son hates me.

813
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,160
how should I convince him?

814
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:15,640
Will he never forgive me?

815
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,480
I don’t know if you will forgive your mother or not.

816
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,320
The decision is yours.

817
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,720
I will not say she suffered more than you.

818
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:39,440
But son, she has suffered a lot for you two.

819
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:46,600
Sometimes we feel

820
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,160
there is no greater pain beyond ours.

821
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,400
And that is why we are not able to see

822
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,400
how our loved ones also struggle with their pain

823
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,040
I met Madhav too

824
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,320
He didn’t say anything.

825
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,480
I won’t ask why you have taken this decision.

826
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,760
you might have some reasons or compulsions

827
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:28,600
If you don’t participate in the competition tomorrow,

828
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,920
your friends will be losing a huge opportunity.

829
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,960
Who are you?

830
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,280
What are you doing here?

831
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,080
I am the Principal of Tansen Music School.

832
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,120
oh?

833
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,760
Your son is immensely talented .

834
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,520
You should encourage him

835
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,880
And how will that help?

836
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:57,160
He won’t feed himself by being a musician on the street!

837
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,960
I am talking about his future.

838
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:06,200
If he wins the competition tomorrow , he can change his
life.

839
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,440
And yours.

840
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,960
Guddu will not go anywhere.

841
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,440
Get out of my house.

842
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:34,640
That Principal was trying teach me what is good for my son.

843
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,600
Stop, don’t hurt him

844
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,680
Are you going to kill him?

845
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,160
Let him be.

846
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,160
This is a family matter.

847
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,360
Leave.

848
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,480
brother you are such a lunatic

849
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,080
I will not spare you today

850
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,480
You went to meet your mother?

851
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,360
will you go again ?

852
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,800
You want to be a musician ?

853
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,240
Here, sit!

854
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,600
play

855
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,120
play

856
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:35,520
This is how you play it.

857
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,640
turning out to be just like his mother

858
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,480
Don’t hit us

859
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,640
no.. don't

860
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,400
please

861
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,440
Traitors

862
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,400
Traitors

863
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,160
I raised you!

864
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:17,200
Let me see how you will go to the school competition
tomorrow.

865
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,160
Will lock you for a few days

866
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,720
You will stop dreaming of going to school.

867
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,760
You will remember this lesson for life.

868
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,480
I don’t know if you will forgive your mother or not.

869
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:03,800
The decision is yours.

870
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,280
Nor will I say she suffered more than you.

871
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:15,240
But son, she has suffered for you two a lot.

872
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:39,920
When ever life got me down

873
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:47,760
I found myself remembering you, mother

874
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:55,120
Whenever I felt like breaking down,

875
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:01,440
I found myself remembering you, mother

876
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,360
Oh Mother?.

877
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,080
My mother

878
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,880
Oh Mother?.

879
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,000
My mother

880
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:42,720
Our sponsors, Furtados School of Music welcomes you all to
the

881
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:50,560

882
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:56,080
Sir I have moved their performance from 9th position to 11th
.

883
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,280
I hope they make it.

884
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:07,520
Let’s welcome our 1st team ‘The Echoes’ from Modern Public
School

Please give them a huge round of applause

01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,200
It’s your competition today, right?

887
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,320
Quickly get ready and get out of here.

888
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,840
Before your father comes back go from this place.

889
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,880
Listen if you win today you can change your life.

890
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,560
The principal was right.

891
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,000
This opportunity doesn’t come every day.

892
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,560
Hurry up

893
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,880
Quickly run away.

894
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,680
Go quickly ..quietly ..

895
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,720
Go

896
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,800
Go

897
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,240
Hey..

898
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,480
Where are you running?

899
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,200
Stop!

900
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,080
I will break your legs..

901
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,160
Stop.....

902
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,240
Stop.....

903
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,440
I will not leave you today...

904
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,080
How long will you run...

905
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,160
Stop ..

906
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:08,880
Look at the principal’s face

907
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,920
He is so defeated.

908
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,480
We are the only ones who will perform today

909
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,440
Are you sure?

910
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,200
What if they come?

911
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,720
They are not going to make it.

912
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,080
Why do you think we paid off Mangu.

913
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,200
Mark my words, the principle is going to come to us,

914
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,240
begging us to perform

915
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,760
Madhav...........

916
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,880
Children (crying)

917
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,800
Open the door!

918
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,080

919
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,720
Chuttan.....

920
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,520
Somebody help us.

921
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,600
We are here.

922
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,760
Open the door!
Help us please.

923
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,600
We are here.

924
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,560
Mithi ?

925
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,000
Guddu

926
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,320
Wait.
I will get you out of here.

927
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,440
Guddu.......

928
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,040
Guddu.......?

929
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,600
Come on let's get out of here..

930
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Show me where is he gone !

931
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,400
Lock the door fast...

932
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,600
Punjabi Folk song

933
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,160
Sir, what is this we are hearing?

934
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,760
Why are our students not performing?

935
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,520
Sir, we must give our students a chance.

936
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,000
I really think we can win this competition.

937
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,080
Sir, we don’t have any time left

938
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:09,800
Madam

939
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,240
what if Guddu does not come?

940
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,640
That Guddu!

941
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,760
Where has he taken my kids?

942
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,720
Let’s hurry

943
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,440
Here.,.

944
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:52,880

Here.,.

946
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,640
What happened?

947
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,800
Who did this..?

948
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,560
They beat us up and broke all the instruments...

949
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:23,720

Oh but that is just an excuse ..

960
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,840
The world makes me cry..

961
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,720
Oh but that is just an excuse ..

962
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,560
The fight within is with myself..

963
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,600
I have to make myself win

964
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:25,000
When the tears

965
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:34,120
When the tears poured out finally ..

966
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,840
I found myself remembering you, mother ..

967
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:47,560
Oh Mother..My mother..

968
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,720
A big round of applause.

969
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,560

You are a Human Being, do not lose heart

988
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:37,160
You are a Human Being, do not lose heart

Be careful, so that the opportunity is not gone

990
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:53,880
When has a good effort gone waste?

991
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:58,200
Do not take the world only as a dream

992
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:04,320
Be the guide of your own path

Then simply trust and go

1000
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,280
Drink the nectar of your existence

1001
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,600

1006
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,400

1009
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,600

01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,080
Madhav start stinging

1013
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:53,040
Boo...

1014
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,160
Boo...

1015
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:49,320
You should know your glory

1016
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,640
You should be aware that you are special

1017
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,880
You should know your glory

1018
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,200
You should be aware that you are special

1019
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,440
Even after we die our songs should reverberate in this world

1020
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,760
Whether we lose everything now only, then also we should
save our honour

1021
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:03,000
Even after we die our songs should reverberate in this world

1022
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,240
Whether we lose everything now only, then also we should
save our honour

1023
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,480
Whatever may be you should not leave your effort

1024
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,840
Whatever may be you should not leave your effort

1025
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,840
Whatever may be you should not leave your effort

1026
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,200
Whatever may be you should not leave your effort

1027
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,200
You are a Human Being, do not lose heart

1028
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:24,560
You are a Human Being, do not lose heart

1029
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:40,640
Please stop.

1030
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,840
As per the rules of this competition

1031
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:50,000
you must be able to play one traditional musical instrument.

1032
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:03,720
I’m afraid if you cannot play a traditional musical
instrument,

1033
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,160
you do not qualify for participation in this competition.

1034
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:13,040
Is there a problem?

1035
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:14,920
You didn’t inform the kids that

1036
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,600
playing a traditional musical instrument is mandatory for
this competition?

1037
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,920
What happened, Sir?

1038
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,600
Fine, Team number 11, do you know how to play any such
musical instrument?

1039
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,800
Can I play this ?

1040
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:58,680
sing

1041
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:01,160
sing something

1042
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:04,000
Before we announce the winning team,

1043
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,120
‘Bal Tansen Award’

1044
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,240
So, have you become a singer?

1045
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:22,680
Your friends will never forgive you for life.

1046
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:25,800
I have travelled many countries

1047
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:28,920
Met fantastic musicians

1048
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:32,360
Heard a lot of world music

1049
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,800
And I can say

1050
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,840
This prize winner is out of the world!

1051
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,480

1052
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,320

Crowd

1054
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,720
You were always worthless

1055
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:52,320
Now you spoilt there chances as well

1056
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,880
Go

1057
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:12,760
Guddu will never forgive me

1058
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,160
Sir...Guddu is not here

1059
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,760
Madhav

1060
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,560
Madhav

1061
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,280
Madhav

1062
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,200
Madhav

1063
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,600
Madhav

1064
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:45,560
Madhav

1065
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:48,600
Guddu is not here

1066
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,880
But...

1067
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,840
But his father is here

1068
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,520
I would request him to come

1069
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,960
and collect Guddu’ award.

1070
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:17,480
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1071
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,960
Please give a big hand to Vishnu ji

1072
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:25,640
He is a very good musician and Pakhawaj player

1073
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,800
Vishnu ji, please come

1074
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:57,720
And now I would like to Guddu’s mother Mohini ji on stage

1075
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:06,560

1076
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:22,440

1077
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,960
Mohiniji please

1078
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:54,680
So, the final winner of today’s competition is

1079
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:58,760
‘Tansen Music School’

1080
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,400
Madhav

1081
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,640
Forgive me my friend,

1082
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:24,280
That day I went ,wherever the train took me

1083
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:28,840
I lived with the guilt

1084
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:32,440
I went to a different town

1085
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:35,160
I pursued studies in a social welfare school

1086
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:40,920
read all the books that I had been wanting to read

1087
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:57,480
And then one day, I read your interview in a magazine

1088
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:00,640
You spoke about our band

1089
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,080
You spoke about me!

1090
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,880
I know you have missed me as much as I have missed you

1091
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,400
I came to Jhansi looking for you

1092
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,360
But you were not there

1093
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:17,320
Principal Sir told me everything.

1094
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,280
met Mithi and Chuttan too.

1095
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:26,480
You must be knowing, Mithi is now a ‘Kathak’ dance teacher.
and Chuttan has become a Banker now

1096
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:31,440
You know I was so happy when I got to know

1097
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:34,960
That we won

1098
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,800
I was so happy that day

1099
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,720
I went to the old church

1100
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,560
To say thanks to Jesus.

1101
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,360
You know who I met there?

1102
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:02,920
I met Rea.

1103
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:05,520
You must be wondering who is Rea.

1104
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,760
Remember my dream! The same one.

1105
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
She told me that after the performance
she try to search me

1106
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:18,360
But she couldn’t find me

1107
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,480
Guess, I was destined to meet her again this way.

1108
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:23,320
Now we are getting married

1109
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:29,480
And this wedding is not taking place
without ma , baba , Lata and you

1110
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:35,240
I am also sending the first copy of my novel ‘Atkan
Chatkan’.

1111
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:39,960
I wrote this a few years ago

1112
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,760
but couldn’t find the right ending.

1113
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:58,680
Come soon.

1114
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,120
