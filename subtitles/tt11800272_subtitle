1
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,041
Today...is the culmination of a dream

2
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:54,125
It could be the beginning
of a long journey....

3
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,125
...or its end. I am not sure.

4
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,500
Because...this journey is not for us.

5
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,291
It's for him.

6
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,416
One thing is for sure...
we are not alone.

7
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,583
He is right here....with us.

8
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:26,291
MOHAN KUMAR FANS

9
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,625
- Hello Prakash!
- What's the plan?

10
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,708
I am just leaving to the temple

11
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,500
- Are you here in Kochi?
- No...I am at Thiruvananthapuram

12
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,583
I made an offering to
Ganapathi for your success!

13
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,333
It's your comeback after 30 years!

14
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,666
Thirty years! I don't think
one offering will do!

15
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,291
I'll be watching the noon show here...
I'll call as soon as it is over

16
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,833
- Ok?
- Ok...Ok, Prakash!

17
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,916
- Sreekutty? - Yes? - Not ready yet, dear?
- Just 2 more minutes, Dad!

18
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,083
- I'll be right there
- Ok!

19
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,250
- Kumari Amma?
- Yes, I am coming

20
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,625
- Give one to her
- Sure

21
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,375
- Sir! - Coming!
- I saw it, Sir! - Did you?

22
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,291
- The ad is fantastic! - Is it?
- You should give me a treat! - Sure!

23
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,791
- Here! Watch the movie today itself!
- Sure! - And let me know what you think!

24
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,875
- I will! - See you then!
- Ok! Right!

25
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
(Movie ad in the paper)
"A Nearby Horizon"

26
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,083
Eyes turned upward,

27
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,875
I stand here to sing

28
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,333
By my side, in kindness,

29
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,208
Won't you listen?

30
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,541
You wipe away the darkness on Earth

31
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,625
Oh! Golden Star!

32
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,708
Fill me from within,

33
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,875
Oh, flame of love!

34
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:08,208
Like a thousand clouds,

35
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,958
Do watch over me

36
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,625
I am as an infant,

37
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,875
Do protect me!

38
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,791
Like a thousand clouds,

39
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,708
Do watch over me

40
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:33,166
I am as an infant,

41
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,541
Do protect me!

42
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:41,458
Eyes turned upwards,

43
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,000
I stand here to sing

44
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:49,625
By my side, in kindness,

45
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,208
Won't you listen?

46
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
- Hey there, boy!
- Huh?

47
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,416
It's time to go! You were supposed
to be home by now!

48
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,833
- What's the hurry? - We are off
to meet another girl today, Father

49
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,750
- How many is it now?
- Around...fifteen...

50
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,041
Oh, really?

51
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,458
- Let's wind up for now. Carry on
with your plans. - Ok

52
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,416
- Only two more songs to go. - Ok
- We'll try them on Sunday

53
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,541
- Sure! You go ahead now!
- Ok

54
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,375
I'll be getting off on the way.
I am not coming with you.

55
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Come on! Just come along! For fun!

56
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,750
As if it's a musical performance! For fun!

57
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,875
Nice lad, isn't he? We should baptise him
and bring him to our side!

58
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,875
What for? So God can have him for snack?

59
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,416
If a man is good, what difference does his
caste make?

60
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,000
- Or his religion?
- Oh! The mom-son duo are both here?

61
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,958
- Good morning! - What's a bride-meet
without our dear Aunt?

62
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,958
- Hey! Did you know? - What?
- The girl's dad is a great musician

63
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,333
When they heard that you sing,
they seemed keen to fix the wedding!

64
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,625
So you mean this is just a preview?

65
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,250
- Alright, let's move!
- Get going, man!

66
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,916
His name is Krishnanunni...if you need
him to teach music in your parish...

67
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,541
- ...I can spare him
- Oh that's nice, Father

68
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,208
(Sings)

69
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,541
It's Raagam Kaapi.

70
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,125
Kaapi is not always sweet.

71
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,125
True, true!

72
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,250
- Why is this kaapi* so spicy? (*coffee)
- It has ginger and pepper in it - Oh!

73
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Specially made for the singer.

74
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,208
For this kind of a meeting,
such formalities are not needed.

75
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,250
That's what she said too.

76
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,000
But after I banged her head
on the wall...

77
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,125
...the kaapi was ready just as I said.

78
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,708
We were told you are a music scholar.

79
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,625
We didn't know you had a funny side too!

80
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,375
By the way...what do you think of Kaanada?
Do you like it?

81
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:10,250
Obviously he is interested in Canada!
Right? He's got a passport and everything!

82
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,166
I meant the Raaga!

83
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,291
- You know, the Kaanada Raaga?
- Hmm

84
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,250
- Dad is out to irritate them!
- Him and his obsession with Raagas!

85
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,666
- You are trained in music and dance
too, aren't you? - Well...yes...

86
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,291
- Hmm. And you? - I...trained in Kalari*
(*a martial art) - I see!

87
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,333
- Alright then. Let's talk business now.
- Yes! - Ok! - So...

88
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,000
...how many of the Melakartha Raagas
have you memorised?

89
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,958
- That would be...
- At least three hundred?

90
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,791
But...aren't there only 72 Raagas?

91
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,416
What do you know about Raagas?

92
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Who are you? His teacher?

93
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,083
Listen boy! Unless you cast this one
out of your home...

94
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,541
...you will never make it as a singer!

95
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,916
- Stay calm! - Aunt! Let's leave!
- Sit!

96
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,833
Let me get the box.

97
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,791
Mom! Unless you force Dad to take medicine,
we are going to stay unmarried forever!

98
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,000
Nasty old man!

99
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,291
(Sings a classical tune)

100
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,541
- Hey! Listen! Father of the Bride!
- What? Go for a ride?

101
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,625
My brother Krishnanunni is here
to meet your daughter

102
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,791
Not to audition for a stage performance!
Got it?

103
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,625
This won't work! Let's go!

104
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,125
If this wedding happens,
he will make you sing to death!

105
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,875
How about a farewell song before you leave?

106
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,375
- What do you think? Huh?
- Are you coming or what?

107
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,500
Aunt! Please make sure you make
enquires about the family...

108
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,625
...before we set out on these trips again!

109
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,166
- Mom! - Yes?
- Looks like they are back!

110
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,333
I hope he liked this one!

111
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,083
- When did you get here, brother-in-law?
- Just now

112
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,250
- Ok...I'll be right out!
- Ok

113
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,625
- So brother-in-law! How was the girl?
- Hmm - What?

114
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,208
- What? - Hmm
- What happened, sister?

115
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,333
You look upset. It didn't work out?

116
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,708
You know, it isn't like I am well enough
to go around like this!

117
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,333
If I am able to find a nice girl for him...

118
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,583
...I would think of it as a good deed!

119
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,666
So, Aunt...you want him to get married
to a mad man's daughter?

120
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,750
Shut up, you scoundrel! If I had known...

121
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,208
...would I have you dragged you two there?

122
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,291
Oh God! Was he really mad?

123
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,708
I don't know if he was really mad
or duplicate mad.

124
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,875
He asked him some questions about music.

125
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,083
Something about Canada or America
or something.

126
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,916
Go ahead and laugh!
Anyone can make a mistake!

127
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,583
But if he ever gets married...
I will be the one to arrange it!

128
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,500
He is going to be the future Yesudas,
you know? Yesudas!

129
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,041
- (mimics Yesudas singing)
- What, boy? - Nothing!

130
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,166
- I wouldn't mind some tea.
- I'll get it for you.

131
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,958
- Who's the special tea for?
- Mohan Kumar Sir! - Huh?

132
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,625
You know? Mohan Kumar Sir - the one
who acted in this movie?

133
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,500
Oh! Mohan Kumar!

134
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,708
I gave him tea during the interval.
Now it's almost the climax.

135
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,000
Who knows? He could be
a super star by tomorrow!

136
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,041
If that happens, why not plant
some goodwill right now?

137
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,916
What did you just say?

138
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,916
- That he could be a star tomorrow?
- Yes!

139
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,833
He already was a star!

140
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,708
He starred as hero in some twenty odd
movies of great acclaim

141
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,833
But when Mohanlal and Mammootty
took the scene by storm...

142
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,208
...he was among the actors
who got washed out!

143
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,250
- Oh! Is that so?
- Now, for around thirty years...

144
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,833
...he hasn't been seen in a movie
or serial or anything...

145
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,666
Well...there are a few
who ended up like that

146
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,166
(from on-screen movie)
It's ringing....you can speak

147
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,583
Dad! Please don't hang up, Dad!

148
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,375
I couldn't see things from your perspective

149
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,250
I would never curse you, son

150
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,041
- Sir, tea? - No
- There are things I could never understand

151
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,750
- Tea? - No, thanks!
- I know there is some helplessness...

152
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,291
- ...that made you abandon me
- The movie is good!

153
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,333
But your role doesn't seem
meaty enough for you!

154
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,083
All the heroes in this idiot director's
movies have won state awards

155
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,416
That's why I did it!
Or I wouldn't have given a rat's arse!

156
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,833
Hmm...this looks like
it will pick up a few awards

157
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,666
But...he is the real hero
of the movie, isn't he?

158
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,000
- When they narrated the story to me,
I was the hero! - Hmm

159
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,916
- Please, Dad!
- I'll come, Son!

160
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,750
How old is your daughter now?

161
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,666
I want to see her before I die!

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,375
I will come, Son...I will come!

163
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,000
A rainbow appears
- You were great! - Thank you!

164
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,666
Where before the starry skies had faded
- Can we take a selfie?

165
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,166
My heart fills with sweet moonshine
- Come on, move closer!

166
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,583
Like it was always waiting for me

167
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,666
A symphony builds up again

168
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,791
As thought someone is playing for me

169
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:23,375
A bygone era, slowly..

170
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,458
Seems to be humming a melody again

171
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,083
Every pathway takes on new shades

172
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,125
As every bud blossoms

173
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,083
Every night brings to every day

174
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,125
A brand new song every time

175
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,458
- Hello? Mr Mohan Kumar?
- Yes?

176
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,541
This is the office of Education Minister,
V K Nandakumar

177
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,041
- The Minster would like to talk to you
- Oh! Sure! - Let me connect him for you

178
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
- It's the Minister!
- Hello Mr Mohan - Hello Sir!

179
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,541
I saw your movie
in Thiruvananthapuram yesterday

180
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,583
- Oh...
- It had a great message!

181
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,250
- And your acting was superb!
- Thank you!

182
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,791
- And Mohan... - Yes, Sir? - When the
State awards are announced this year...

183
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,583
...I am hopeful of seeing your name!

184
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,000
- Thank you! Thank you, Sir!
- I'll see you around then! - Ok, Sir!

185
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,875
Awesome!

186
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,791
Summers turns into a shower of snow

187
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,583
That melts in the sunshine of spring

188
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,041
A lily sways in the wind

189
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,416
As someone whispers in her ear

190
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,708
A drop of moonlight

191
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,166
In the bylanes of my mind

192
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,166
Softly, like a dream

193
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,208
Appears like bejewelled drops of rain

194
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,375
Mr Mohan Kumar! Namaskar!

195
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,000
Can we go in this car, Sir?

196
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,083
- Didn't you have a driver?
- Yes...I did...

197
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,000
After working for me
and building up some contacts...

198
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,375
...he is now a movie Production Manager

199
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,666
- And he got me someone to take his place
- Oh

200
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,291
A guy named Krishnanunni - he is
all set to be the future Yesudas!

201
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,375
He is off on some stage event today

202
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,916
- I see - He's a nice chap...I am hoping
he will make it - Right!

203
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,791
And these days, I don't really need
a driver on a regular basis

204
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,333
- If you need him, just let me know.
I can send him over - Ok

205
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,750
It must be around five years
since you last came here

206
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,208
Around the time you were taking up
that Vijay movie for distribution

207
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,875
Yes...in the last six years, that was,
the only one that made me some money

208
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,125
- Oh!
- With that, I turned fully to distribution

209
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,208
- Oh! - And then I managed to lose
my ancestral home in Kanjirappally

210
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,083
- What?
- It's true!

211
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,750
Because my wife is a doctor
and because her family supports us...

212
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,875
...we managed to keep the flat we live in

213
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,333
It's a year since I paid the rent
for this building

214
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,875
The owner is a humane person
with a love for the movies

215
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,083
You are lucky you did not venture
into production

216
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,958
You put your money in the bank
and lived a decent life

217
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,208
I was never lavish

218
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,333
I am happy with what I have

219
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,875
I did have a few minor losses
in business as you know

220
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,500
Just minor! You did not end up
losing your home like I did!

221
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,625
- Can I get you some tea?
I only have black! - Ok

222
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,250
Financial security is such a relief, Mohan!

223
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,208
- Sir...
- Oh...

224
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,541
You're early! Come in!

225
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,041
Know him? Arun Rajeev...

226
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,083
A director whose movies ran for
hundred days each

227
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,291
- Oh yes...I know...
- He has a fantastic script in hand

228
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,541
We met on a train. He told me
a thread he had in mind

229
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,291
I told him not to mention it
to anyone else!

230
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,625
I told him to get cracking on the script
immediately...

231
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,958
- ...and made him promise it to me!
Some tea for you? - Yes

232
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,166
- Ok - Sir, I watched your movie...
your performance was awesome!

233
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,625
You will win an award for it...I am sure!

234
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,791
Everyone's been saying that, right?

235
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,166
God is great! Though you had a long wait...

236
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,125
...you got a great character
and you did a great job!

237
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,625
Here...

238
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,166
This project is my lifeline now

239
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,166
- You know...that new hero who worked
in your movie...Krupesh? - Yes

240
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,625
I have an appointment with him

241
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,416
- Oh
- I have to convince him to do it

242
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,083
It will all work out, Prakash

243
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,666
'Pulari Pictures' will have a fresh dawn

244
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,125
- Hello!
- Grandpa, didn't you get anything for us?

245
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,708
- I didn't...but your Uncle did!
- Oh no, Grandpa! - Very bad!

246
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,875
- There! Everything you asked for!
- Wow!

247
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,958
Thank you!

248
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,416
(Heated debate on TV)

249
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,958
(talking to the TV)
Come on! Give him what he is asking for!

250
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,916
Move, Grandpa!

251
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,833
All he wants is 30 seconds!
Just give it to him!

252
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,916
- Could I have some hot water for my bath?
- Ok

253
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,041
Just give it to him for heaven's sake!

254
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,041
Don't drop it, Ambadi

255
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,250
- Praise be, Father!
- Where are you?

256
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,375
- Back in your nest?
- Yes, I am!

257
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,916
I have some songs to look at. There is a
musical prayer event at Kulamavu next week

258
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
- At Kulamavu?
- Yes

259
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't make a kulam* of it!
(*mess)

260
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,458
- The place is known for its musclemen!
- Did you call me to crack this lame joke?

261
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,583
No...when you were here to teach
the choir the other day...

262
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:27,000
- ...remember you met my friend,
Father Jason? - Yes

263
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,500
Some one in his parish
works for a reputed TV channel

264
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,125
As a Program Director. And they...

265
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,958
...are launching a music show soon

266
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,625
- Oh! - The guy's name is Pratheesh
- Ok

267
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,208
I'll Whatsapp his number to you

268
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,333
Talk to him and get the details...

269
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,458
- ...and meet him tomorrow, ok?
- Ok...sure!

270
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,250
(contestant singing at audition)

271
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,791
Perfect!

272
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,666
(Contestant sings in background)
- Next! - Here

273
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,791
- Your name and sign - here!
- Ok

274
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Can you check if that is ok?

275
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,541
- Where is the Program Producer, Pratheesh?
- Inside...at the console

276
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,958
- Sir? - Yes?
- Are you a contestant? - Yes

277
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,125
- Are you taking part too? - Yes...
you have been to our college...

278
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,166
- You taught us a song for a group event
- Oh

279
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,041
Yes...I sometimes do that
when I have time...just for fun...

280
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,041
Hey! Stop the flirting and go on inside!

281
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,958
Look...I don't know anyone here...

282
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,041
Oh...Ok...

283
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,750
- The Program Producer, Pratheesh
is a friend of mine - Oh! - Hey! You!

284
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,833
- See you around - Ok. Just a moment!

285
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,750
(contestant singing at audition)

286
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,625
- Aneesh!
- Sir?

287
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,750
The word is not 'Uyare'(high)...
it is 'Uyire' (life)

288
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,083
It is when you are losing your life
that you point upwards!

289
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,208
Don't even know the lyrics but they
want to sing!

290
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,625
Sir...are you...Pratheesh?

291
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,333
- Yes...I am Pratheesh
- Father Jason sent me

292
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,666
- Oh! Right! Krishnanunni?
- Yes

293
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,750
But Father only mentioned one person

294
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,791
Huh? I am just one person!

295
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,291
- I am both Krishnan and Unni
- Then what about this one here?

296
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,916
- Huh? - I...am just here to sing

297
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,958
When he said you were his best friend...

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,291
...I just wanted to say hi

299
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh...not best friend...
I just said friend...

300
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,208
Hey! When did we become friends?

301
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,375
- You know...just for the flow...of casual
conversation... - Ok, ok!

302
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,875
I'll get your tags...
if you are called next...

303
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,250
- ...are you ready to sing?
- Yes... - Yes!

304
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,625
- We'll call you next...wait there
- Ok - Thank you, Sir

305
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,666
- What's your name?
- Sree Ranjini

306
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,833
Of the senior singers,
who is your favourite?

307
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,833
I really like Vani Jayaram's songs

308
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,000
And which of Vani ma'am's songs
are you singing today?

309
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,625
I like all her songs...but let me try
this one...

310
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,333
Ok...you may start

311
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,208
(sings a famous old song by Vani Jayaram)

312
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,791
- Wonderful! Do you work, Sree Ranjini?
- Yes, sir...at an interior design firm

313
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,500
- I am trying to turn independent soon
- Go ahead and quit that job!

314
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,166
- Congrats! - Thank you, Sir!
Thank you so much! Thank you!

315
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,791
- Krishnanunni! - Sir!

316
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,208
(Judge sings)

317
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,416
Sing me something with Chandrika* in it
(*moonlight)

318
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh yes! I'll do that!

319
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,250
(Krishnanunni sings an old song with
the word moonlight in it)

320
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,500
What's going on, Damodara?
What are you cackling about?

321
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,291
He went to this big audition
for a music show...got selected...

322
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:49,041
-...even got a standing ovation from
the judges! - No...no standing ovation!

323
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,625
- But they did say they liked it!
- That is a green signal, my boy...

324
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,625
Like Rukku Edathi* says, it is your green
signal to be the future Yesudas! (*sister)

325
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,916
- Correct!
- I...I have something to ask all of you

326
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,416
- Ok - Ok
- Now that...he is...

327
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,791
- ...getting into the real estate
business... - Reality show!

328
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:08,291
...ok...whatever!...should he continue
to be a driver for that Producer guy?

329
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,583
Shouldn't he just focus on his singing?

330
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:14,000
He is supposed to be meeting directors...
singing in movies...

331
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:17,333
- ...but nothing has happened yet!
- I feel the same!

332
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,416
There is a time for each person!

333
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,333
I was with him for two years
and with the contacts I made...

334
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,666
...I was able to make it
as a movie Production Controller

335
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,541
You concentrate on your singing
for a while...If this clicks...

336
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,958
- ...your life will be a merry ride!
- How can I do that?

337
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,750
He did whatever he promised...it's not
his fault it didn't work out for me...

338
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,458
I can't quit that job in a hurry...
and it isn't right...

339
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:40,083
I just made it through an audition...
I am not a movie playback singer yet!

340
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,250
I too feel you shouldn't quit your job
till you have actually made it

341
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,166
It's always good to have a job, brother

342
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,750
I was just asking for your opinions.
If that's what you all feel, let it be so.

343
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,125
That's best!

344
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,666
Five, six, seven and...

345
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,791
...and...and...

346
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,333
Five, six, seven and...

347
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Oh! Careful!

348
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,458
Gosh! Listen...

349
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,875
- Is it this way or that?
- ...there is no need to flex your muscles!

350
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,083
- It's a simple step! Why are you being so
wooden? - I just...

351
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,125
- ...so I need not be stiff?
- That's right

352
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,083
What's to laugh at? Huh?

353
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,291
Lousy steps! Come here for a second

354
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,083
- Come - What is it, Krupesh?
- Eh? - I mean...sir...

355
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,625
- Do you know how to sew a shirt?
- No

356
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:30,041
- Do you know how to make a paratha? - No
- How about beef curry? - No

357
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,875
I can all do this very well. I don't
know the things you know...

358
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,958
- ...and you don't know what I know!
- Now I understand

359
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,250
if you dare to be oversmart
with me again...

360
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,250
...I will get another choreographer
who knows how to respect stars

361
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,375
- And you will be out! Shall I do that?
- No sir... - Sir!

362
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,458
- You can dance as you wish!
- Prakash Sir is here

363
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,125
I'll be right back. By then,
set some easy steps for me

364
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,750
I'll do that, Sir!

365
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,625
- Please sit! - You look all sweaty!
- I am used to it, sir

366
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:56,333
- Come, let's go again!
- So you have brought the script? - Yes

367
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,583
It's detailed

368
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:01,333
- Sir...I have something to say but I hope
you won't think I am arrogant - What?

369
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:05,875
I have done only 6 movies so far...
and 4 of them hit hundred days...

370
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:09,000
Two are now in theaters....and doing well..

371
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,041
Thankfully no movie of mine
has stalled midway

372
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:16,375
- I hope you understand my... - You want
to know if I can complete this movie

373
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,583
You can ask around if any movie of mine
was abandoned midway

374
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,666
- No, sir...I didn't...
- It's alright...I...

375
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,666
...wasn't arguing with you, Krupesh

376
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,208
But believe me. I have some NRI friends...

377
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,083
...who will invest the funds.
Just tell me when you can do it.

378
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,375
That's all! The funds are ready!

379
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,833
Can I talk to him in private?

380
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,333
Sure!

381
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,458
It's all great to hear there are investors
and funds...but will it actually happen?

382
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:50,750
Prakash sir is a real producer
who loves films

383
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,875
- Hmm
- Such people should not be destroyed!

384
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,291
Please just read the script, Krupesh

385
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,000
It's your script...I don't need to read it

386
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,833
Sir...if we are proceeding...

387
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,208
- If we are?
- ...all the funds should be in the bank...

388
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,875
...and I need to see the statement...
is that too arrogant of me to ask?

389
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:08,958
Uh...

390
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,708
No...not at all.

391
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,208
Ok! Then we will discuss further

392
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,833
- Arun..
- Ok...

393
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,000
- Jiby! - Sir!
- Show me the tough steps...

394
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:24,041
- ...like I was asking for
- Idiot! - Why did you agree, sir?

395
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,875
Do you really need to convince him
like that? Let's try someone else!

396
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,291
I am not a succesful producer at the moment

397
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:34,125
So I know there will be some torturing
and over-ruling right now...

398
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,125
Doing a movie with this guy right now,
is a safe bet for us

399
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,500
He has the satellite rights...
and the audience...

400
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:45,458
And more importantly...the movie
can be made in a comfortable budget

401
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,041
But to ask for a bank statement...!

402
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,625
He is concerned about his own survival

403
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:53,375
Just see it that way...and also, Arun...

404
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:56,583
...when we are down...
it is best to put our ego...

405
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,666
...and pride on the back burner

406
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,916
I speak from experience!

407
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,041
- Hello, Pratheesh?
- Yes...as I told you the other day...

408
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,833
...your shoot is the day after.
You are free, aren't you?

409
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:11,916
- Yes I am..
- Ok...and...

410
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,166
...we are starting on the duet round.
You remember Krishnanunni?

411
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,791
He'll partner you in that round.
And this time it's not movie songs.

412
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:21,000
You two need to write your own lines
and compose the music, ok?

413
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh no! I can't compose music

414
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,916
Ok...why don't you two talk
and make a plan?

415
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,875
I will send you the lines...
don't get worried, ok?

416
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,291
- Ok...see you then!
- Ok

417
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:40,333
Krishnanunni...do you know
the old actor, Mohan Kumar?

418
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:43,083
- Yes
- Mohan is a close friend of mine - Oh!

419
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,208
Now that one of his movies is doing well...

420
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,750
...he has some inaugurations
and events to attend

421
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,833
- Ok
- Could you work for him two months?

422
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,041
I had talked to him about you
some time back

423
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,833
But today he called me and asked

424
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:00,291
By God's grace, one of my projects
should be on pretty soon

425
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,291
And then you can come back here

426
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,000
Sir...I have made a lot of efforts
to be able to sing in a movie

427
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,416
And that is the reason I started
working for you

428
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:12,041
- I am not really...
- To be honest with you...

429
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,333
...even the registration certificate
for this car is pawned!

430
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:18,916
I haven't even paid you for two months

431
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,625
- But Sir...I did not mean...
- Let me say something

432
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,083
If the project happens...
and I mean it will...

433
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,625
...you will surely have a song
- or songs - in it!

434
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,958
I give you my word!

435
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,625
For now, just do what I said

436
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,791
Every change is an opportunity,
Krishnanunni!

437
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,375
Ok

438
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
- Who are you?
- Krishnanunni!

439
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,666
Prakash sir sent me...
he said you need a driver...?

440
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,041
So you brought the entire neighbourhood?

441
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,208
Oh no! They are not with me!

442
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,500
We are from the Nair Service Society

443
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,458
- We are here to meet you
- Oh! You called yesterday! - Yes

444
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,458
Please come in!

445
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,791
- And Unnikrishnan...
- It's Krishnanunni... - Ok...

446
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,833
...Krishnanunni, we will talk
after they leave, alright?

447
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,666
- Oh, alright!
- And...

448
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,125
The car is a left hand drive...
why don't you try it out?

449
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:19,208
- I'll send the keys out
- Ok

450
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,541
Kumari Amma...give him the key

451
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,541
(Krishnanunni whistles a tune)

452
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,666
What's your name?

453
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,458
- Krishnanunni
- You're a driver, aren't you?

454
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,500
- Well...yes... - So why are you
dressed like you're going to a wedding?

455
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,000
Dress more soberly from now on, ok?

456
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,375
- There's a grown girl in the house
- Ok

457
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,750
And this car...is our boss's heart,
you know...his heart!

458
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,416
He bought it in his heydays...
here is the key

459
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,958
Hey! Take it respectfully!

460
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,708
- So let me tell you why we are here
- Ok

461
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,375
The Sunday after next...
we would like to give you a reception...

462
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:02,291
...at the Rama Varma Club

463
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,083
- Is that necessary?
- Yes!

464
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:08,333
- It's a grand comeback after thirty years!
- And the movie is doing great!

465
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,833
Just a second!

466
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,375
- Hi Ravi Etta* - Where are you?
- At home (*brother)

467
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:19,250
- You sound upset
- Yes...there is something...

468
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,458
Our movie...is being pulled
from the theatres tomorrow

469
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,833
Day after, the Christmas release
movies are opening...

470
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,916
...and they have no theaters to spare,
apparently!

471
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,166
There is a decent collection
coming in from all centres

472
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,666
And family audiences were really
beginning to take it up

473
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,416
Did you speak to the distributors?

474
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:46,333
They just considered this
a small filler movie

475
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,750
So they had booked theaters
for only two weeks, it seems

476
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,708
But the collections are going so good,
Ravi Etta...

477
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,791
I can't tell you how upset I am!

478
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,791
I...will call you later

479
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,791
If possible...let's...

480
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,833
...meet up in the evening

481
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,041
Next Sunday we are booking...

482
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,125
...around 1200 tickets
in several theatres

483
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,208
To give our members who missed it,
a chance to watch it

484
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,333
Why do you look upset, Mohan?

485
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,375
We will pay for the tickets ourselves!

486
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,333
If there was something we could do...

487
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:49,291
At least till the end
of the Christmas vacation...

488
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,791
- ...if we could just hold it
in the theatres! - But...

489
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,583
Do you really think I didn't try?

490
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:58,250
- Do you? - I didn't mean...
- The theatres are all over-booked

491
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:02,250
There are over 160 movies
releasing a year now!

492
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,291
All who watched the movie...
and called me...kept saying...

493
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,625
...I mean...I really started hoping...

494
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,000
When the awards are declared...
I am sure...the movie...and you...

495
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,333
...will win accolades...
and then through TV...

496
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,416
...you will reach more people

497
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,125
- Hello! - Huh?
- Hey! Are you blind or something?

498
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,541
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Didn't recognise me?

499
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,541
Hamsa...Hamsa Randathani...

500
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,125
I don't...

501
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,291
Go back thirty years, just for fun

502
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,916
Your glory days...in old Madras...

503
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,500
I had a desire to direct a movie...

504
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,541
...like my little brother was doing then

505
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:41,250
I had a fantastic script
by Aleppey Sharif...

506
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,000
...and came to you with it.
Remember now?

507
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,375
You were so arrogant!

508
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,791
What with Tamil and Hindi
and all that...and now where are you?

509
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,791
The other day I was in my car...

510
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,791
...and saw your face on a poster

511
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,916
So I thought I would go
and watch your movie

512
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,708
- What a stupid movie!
- Hey! Would you just leave, please?

513
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:04,166
A flimsy storyline and your loud acting!

514
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,250
Didn't it strike you when you watched it?

515
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,166
I just have to ask!

516
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,458
Didn't you ever notice
that cinema has changed?

517
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,416
Your times are over, man!

518
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,291
- Stop it!
- Mohan, no!

519
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,208
I just want to...

520
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,375
- Sir!
- Let it go, Mohan!

521
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,208
- Leave me!
- Come away now

522
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,208
What does it matter
what a stranger says to you?

523
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:38,666
We should just decide we won't shoulder
the waste flung at us!

524
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,125
Did you hear what he said?

525
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,875
Whatever he said, you should not
have let go of your character

526
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,416
You are a fantastic actor!

527
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,083
Fantastic actor indeed!

528
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:54,291
There has never been a more unlucky actor!

529
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:57,083
If people like you, who have tasted success
talk like this...

530
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,000
...what should people like me think?

531
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,875
My sky-high dreams remain...

532
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,875
...like a zero-watt bulb
in the distance!

533
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:06,041
You are one to speak!

534
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,958
Have you even seen my movie
in all these days?

535
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,625
That...is because....well, no.

536
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,583
- No!
- But I will, sir...

537
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,625
Then head straight to the theater

538
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,458
- Now?
- Yes, now!

539
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,958
It's the final show of my movie

540
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:28,083
(dialogues from Mohan's movie on screen)

541
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:06,458
- Hello! - Hello...Krishnanunni?
- Yes

542
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,833
This is Sri Ranjini...I am supposed to sing
the duet with you tomorrow

543
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,583
- I had sent the tune to you - Yes...
but which portion is male and which female?

544
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:17,583
- What? - I mean...my portion?
Which portion am I to sing?

545
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,791
- That is...
- Hey you!

546
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:23,083
- Focus when you drive!
- Hello? Is it a bad time?

547
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,750
- Who is calling you at this hour?
- Hello?

548
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,041
- Can you hear me?
- I...I am driving...and my boss is with me

549
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,583
Don't worry....I will call
in the morning and explain

550
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,708
- Ok?
- Ok then...good night! - Ok

551
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,583
Listen...about the movie being pulled...

552
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:42,125
...and my getting into a drunk fight...
don't tell anyone here, ok?

553
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,708
Oh no! I won't!

554
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:58,083
Hello there! How did you get here?

555
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:01,125
I am here...because Prakash sir
asked me...for two months...

556
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,416
- I told you, remember? He's the driver
- Dad, he is on the reality show

557
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,458
- Oh!
- We are going to sing together tomorrow

558
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,333
- Yes
- It's a small world, my dear...

559
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,333
- ...Sri Krishnan...
- It's Krishnanunni!

560
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,375
Yes! Krishnanunni! Come in!

561
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,166
- Let's have something to eat
- No thanks sir...dinner's waiting at home

562
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,291
- Ok. Good night!
- Good night!

563
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
- Come, honey - Ok
- I...am not really a driver

564
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:26,125
- It's...just for a few days...
- Yes...I got that...it's no big deal...

565
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,708
Alright. I'll see you tomorrow

566
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:01,166
Are your dark eyes...

567
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,791
...speaking softly to me?

568
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,458
Like a gentle breeze...

569
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,458
...I blend into you

570
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:22,541
Are your dark eyes...

571
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,875
...speaking softly to me?

572
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,916
Like a gentle breeze...

573
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:33,000
...I blend into you

574
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,583
Have you arrived upon...

575
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,666
...the shores of love?

576
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,666
And what are the stars...

577
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:46,541
...whispering fondly to us?

578
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:51,416
Without a gaze...without a word...

579
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,791
...who is this that has arrived?

580
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,500
Without a gaze...without a word...

581
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,833
...who is this that has arrived?

582
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:05,500
Are your dark eyes...

583
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:08,958
...speaking softly to me?

584
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,666
Like a gentle breeze...

585
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,916
...I blend into you

586
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:39,291
In a secret bough of moonlight

587
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,833
We met once...tenderly...

588
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:46,375
Upon the fragrant shores of dreams

589
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,958
Why did you appear, gently?

590
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,500
The stars refused to go out

591
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:57,125
And waited lovingly

592
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,708
Tiny clouds, eagerly,

593
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:04,250
Look down, refusing to move away

594
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:09,458
And we faded, unknowing...

595
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:14,833
With a song in our hearts

596
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,416
We blend into the melody

597
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,916
With a song in our hearts

598
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:25,500
We blend into the melody

599
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,916
Are your dark eyes...

600
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:32,625
...speaking softly to me?

601
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:36,250
Like a gentle breeze...

602
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,625
...I blend into you

603
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:42,708
Have you arrived upon...

604
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:46,541
...the shores of love?

605
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,916
And what are the stars...

606
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,208
...whispering fondly saying to us?

607
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:57,625
Without a gaze, without a word...

608
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,416
...who is this that has walked arrived?

609
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,625
Without a gaze, without a word...

610
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:08,166
Who is this that has arrived?

611
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:33,625
- Morning! - Good morning, sir!
- Sit, sit! It's a real busy day!

612
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,333
- So...come to the point!
- Sir...

613
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,541
Consider Brighty's name...
it is so energetic!

614
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,583
It's got great charisma!
We need something similar for you!

615
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,875
But I've already done six movies...
how can I change my name now?

616
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:50,333
Sir...better now
than when you've done fifty!

617
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,791
- Correct!
- And it's not just that...

618
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,583
...when you say 'Krupesh' it sounds a bit
like 'Kapeesh'* (*monkey god)

619
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,250
Not to me! I mean others!

620
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,125
So we have found some good,
energetic names for you

621
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,833
- Just read it out!
- Ok...read!

622
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,125
The first name is...Vinil...

623
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,541
Vinil...Vi...nil...

624
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:16,041
Nil means nothing...I don't want a name
that means 'nothing'!

625
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,541
Ok...the next is a traditional name...

626
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,083
- Pradosh
- Pradosh means evening

627
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,625
Meaning it's all over...burnt out...

628
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,791
Right? I prefer the dawn! Read on!

629
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,833
Ok...then...

630
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,416
We have a Russian style name next

631
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,958
- Russian? That's good! - Yes! It'll help
when you go to Hollywood! - Ya true!

632
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,625
Ok! Tell me...something like "Myshkin"!

633
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,458
- Brazhnev!
- Wonderful! Brazhnev?

634
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:44,000
- No...let's not take that, Sir! - Why?
- When the fans shorten Brazhnev...

635
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,375
...they might call you 'Bra Boy'
or something!

636
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,875
- No, sir! - Shall we cut this one out?
- Better do that, Sir!

637
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,916
Give it to me! Let me read it...
the next name is...

638
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,250
- ...Aakanth!
- Aakranth*? (*Greedy)

639
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,125
- No sir...not Aakranth - Aa-kanth
- What a lousy name!

640
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,750
I told you he wouldn't like these names!

641
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,208
The next name is energetic...

642
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,291
...exotic...fantabulous!

643
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,458
Aghosh!

644
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,750
Aghosh...

645
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:17,125
- Good! - Yes...life is an 'aghosham'*
(*celebration)

646
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,541
Cinema is an 'aghosham'...so an actor
like you should have the name...

647
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,625
- 'Aghosh'!
- Point! Point!

648
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:25,666
- So? - Fix it!
- Finally!

649
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,208
Since we are changing my name anyway...

650
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,875
...just between us...what if
I added a 'Menon' to 'Aghosh'?

651
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,833
'Aghosh Menon'...how's that sound?

652
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,083
- Nice, nice!
- Aghosh...Menon!

653
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,041
A Joshy movie starring Aghosh Menon!

654
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,083
A Priyadarshan movie starring
Aghosh Menon!

655
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:46,416
- Wow! It's quite interesting!
- Wonderful!

656
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,083
- I hope the Menons won't take offence
- Oh no!

657
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,458
No, no, no, no! Well, I don't know if
Biju Menon would cause any trouble

658
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,791
- That's true - Not at all! He's a softie!
I can deal with him! - Ok then!

659
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,375
So...let's clap for Aghosh Menon!

660
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,458
- Yay! - Woohoo!
- Thank you!

661
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,916
Lord, please take over this innocent's
troubles!

662
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:20,000
He has acted in several movies...

663
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,666
...big and small, but...

664
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:27,291
...due to ineptitude, superstition,
recklessness...

665
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,375
...and many such reasons...

666
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:33,291
...he lost the empires he built...

667
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,625
...and is now like a dog that lost
it's bone...

668
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,583
...completely destroyed and reduced to
a pauper

669
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,750
Show mercy on this lost soul!

670
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,916
Hallelujah!

671
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,541
Who says paupered and dog
that lost its bone...

672
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:49,000
- ...in a prayer?
- Yes!

673
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,416
God understands us better...

674
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:54,458
...when we stick to simple prayers

675
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:58,958
But people are so foolish,
they don't get that!

676
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:02,125
When you have the time, look up
Paulkutty Brother on your computer

677
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,458
You'll see lots of testimonies
about miracles!

678
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:07,041
I don't usually make house calls

679
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,333
- This is only because he insisted
- I see....

680
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:14,333
- Hey! - What? - Should I pay him
something? - Oh no!

681
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Stay there

682
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:22,916
If I place a hand on you...
I can measure your heartbeats

683
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,750
You should be really careful, Mohan

684
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:28,083
You have to make it through this year

685
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,333
- What...do you mean? - Whatever came
to your mind when you heard me...

686
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:35,416
...is exactly what I meant

687
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,791
Mohan!

688
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,083
Huh...RC! What's up?

689
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:58,166
Who do you think you are?
A goon? A policeman?

690
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,166
- To be beating people up at the club!
- Oh!

691
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,416
He knows what happened there

692
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,041
- If it was you, you would've cracked
his head! - Listen...

693
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,541
You are an actor!
I stand behind the camera!

694
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,416
- An actor needs to be more diplomatic
- Diplomatic...charismatic...whatever!

695
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,583
Just tell me why you have both
stormed in all of a sudden

696
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:16,708
Hmm...I will tell you

697
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,000
From the day the movie released...
he...and I...

698
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:23,458
...and everyone else said,
you would win accolades for this

699
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,125
The award that we thought was certain...

700
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,166
...is lost because of that tussle

701
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:34,708
The screening for the State award selection
has been on for the past 12 days

702
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,625
The Jury Chairman was E K Naushad

703
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:39,666
Know who he is?

704
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,500
The younger brother of Hamsa Randathani,
the guy you beat up!

705
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:47,708
When your name came up for Best Actor...

706
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:52,000
...he objected...saying your acting was
overly dramatic...not realistic...

707
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:55,250
Also that you were involved in a tussle
in a local bar...and so was not deserving

708
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,041
Stupid reasons!

709
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,875
We did not come here to upset you

710
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
One lost award is not the end of anything

711
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:09,791
But...when an award that you deserved...

712
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,541
...was wilfully snatched away...
we should aim for something bigger!

713
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,166
Above the State awards, there is
something called the National Awards

714
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:23,333
Let's see what Naushad and Randathani
can do at that level!

715
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,208
We are people who have struggled...
gone through hardship...

716
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,208
...and dreamt only of cinema!

717
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,750
We need to show that we cannot be defeated
even if we face blow after blow!

718
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:36,500
For that...we need a voice!

719
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:40,375
Misfortunes in the last minute
have always been a part of my life!

720
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:44,250
I don't want you to try for anything.
I will go on as I am.

721
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:47,291
Sir...

722
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,875
Roles like this don't come every day

723
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:53,333
- We should definitely apply!
- Honey...

724
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:57,208
- ...google the procedures and formalities
to apply - Ok, sure

725
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:06,208
You never took up the minor roles
that came your way

726
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:08,666
Deep inside, you were always a hero!

727
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:13,583
Everything happens for a good reason

728
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:18,333
Whether you want this or not...
those of us who wish you to succeed...

729
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,708
...will apply for this for sure!

730
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:24,125
You deserve this! That is why
we are so adamant

731
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,625
- Uncle!
- Yes?

732
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:28,708
- Checked?
- January 25th...

733
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:31,041
- Tomorrow is the last date!
- Tomorrow?

734
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,458
The entry should be submitted
on or before...

735
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,500
...25th January, 5 pm...

736
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:40,708
...in the National Film Award Committee
Office, New Delhi

737
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,416
That means we have less than 24 hours!

738
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,958
I told you...it's always like this with me

739
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,291
Sir...

740
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,416
Don't think of it as only 24 hours...

741
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:55,000
Think of it as having 24 hours more!

742
00:48:55,791 --> 00:49:00,041
Let us make an effort! You have put in
a brilliant performance! We should try

743
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:04,458
Prakash...call the Producer and Director
and see what can be done

744
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,333
I am presently in Wayanad...Thirunelly...

745
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,416
I am in a shoot
for a Government documentary

746
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,083
- All my assistants are here too
- So what do we do now?

747
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:27,666
It needs to be on the 10 am flight
to Delhi tomorrow

748
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:31,416
I will Whatsapp the list of things to do
and studios you need to go to

749
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,875
If you try hard enough, it can be done!

750
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,166
- Call me if you have any doubts
- Ok

751
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,083
- So what happened?
- Like he said...

752
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:44,333
...we have 24 hours more! Let's give it
a shot!

753
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:47,541
Krishnanunni - I will tell you exactly
what we need to do

754
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:50,166
- You just need to follow my directions!
- I am ready to do whatever it takes!

755
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:52,583
My efforts will be to the maximum.
We need this, Sir!

756
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:54,291
- Let's get started then!
- Ok

757
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:03,791
Like a steady, energetic beat

758
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:06,250
Like the speed at which time flies

759
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:10,708
Like the many moments in time
That seek tiny shores

760
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,750
Like the speed at which time flies

761
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:17,750
Why does the dream that was within sight
seem to slipping away?

762
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:20,958
Why has it hidden behind
An illusory swaying branch?

763
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:23,000
The racing fantasies
- See you, Dad!

764
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,750
Are at the brinks of my eyes

765
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:27,833
This night let's all soar, one by one

766
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:31,166
Every eye with stars shimmering

767
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,541
Slowly, slowly brimming

768
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:38,000
Rain clouds gently pouring

769
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,875
Once done, they drift away
It's Prakash Sir. Put him on speaker.

770
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:44,250
- Hello, Sir? - Krishnanunni...all ok?
- Ok, Sir

771
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,000
You should personally send the courier
from the airport tomorrow

772
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,916
- Don't get into anything else
before that! - Ok

773
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,833
- Of course! - Got all the papers from
Producer Ravi Ettan?

774
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,958
- We are on our way there
- Ok, ok - Like a steady...

775
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,541
...an energetic beat,
Like the speed at which time flies

776
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:05,500
Like the many moments in time
That seek little shores

777
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:07,750
Like the speed at which time flies

778
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,500
Why does the dream that was within sight
Seem to be slipping away?

779
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,666
Why is it hidden behind
Illusory swaying branches?

780
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:17,791
The racing fantasies

781
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:22,375
Are at the brink of my eyes
Now let's soar, one by one

782
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:31,208
- What happened? - The car's not getting
started - But it had no complaints

783
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,500
- Let me see if I can get an autorickshaw
- Ok

784
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,250
- Where's the car?
- It wasn't getting started

785
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,000
- But we did everything we had to do!
- Great...come and have something to eat!

786
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,916
The flight is at 10, right?

787
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:53,375
We need to get it to the airport
courier office before 9

788
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:56,583
I'll get my car and be here by 7.30...
be ready!

789
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,666
- It's raining so bad! How will you go?
- That's ok! I am used to it!

790
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,875
Go carefully!

791
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:21,541
- Come...have a cup of tea...
- Not now...only after we do this!

792
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:25,416
- What? Aren't you coming?
- No...I didn't sleep at all last night

793
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:27,708
I was thinking about this all night long

794
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,541
Also...when we set out for something
auspicious...

795
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:32,666
- ...we shouldn't go in threes - Oh! Ok!
- You two go ahead

796
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,833
- Get going then - Ok, Sir
- See you later, Dad

797
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:39,375
- Hey! The tea is ready!
- Not now, Sir! - Ok

798
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:42,375
Come on, get in!

799
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:50,625
- Did you have anything else to do today?
- Oh no...this is more important right now

800
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,833
I was supposed to meet a girl this evening,
that's all

801
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:56,583
Does this one seem likely to take off?
Actually...it's better if it didn't...

802
00:52:56,833 --> 00:53:00,041
- Huh? Why?
- Once our show is a hit...

803
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,041
...then the proposals will be flying in!
Wait and watch!

804
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:08,041
But...if someone is interested
because of a TV show...

805
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:10,833
- ...I wouldn't want that person!
- Right! Let's see!

806
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:15,000
- Seems to be a police check for drunk
drivers - Show your papers

807
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:17,791
- Stop, stop! - Doesn't seem to be about
drunk drivers - We are doing vehicle checks

808
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:21,875
- This checking is in relation to Republic
Day. Please cooperate. - Ok

809
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,500
- Where are you going? - To the airport...
we are in a bit of a hurry - Ok

810
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,208
- What's that? - This is a package to be
couriered. That's where we are going.

811
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,333
- Ok - Do you need us to step out?
- No

812
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,333
- Sir! - Huh?
- Please come over here, Sir!

813
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,458
- What is it? - Sir...take a look at this!
- Wonder what's going on

814
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:52,083
- What is this? - I don't know, sir!
- You don't know? - I really don't!

815
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,416
- Whose car is this? - Mine
- And where were you going with this?

816
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,750
- To...the airport...
- The airport!

817
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,625
- With this?
- Sir...I really don't know about this!

818
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:01,708
- Hey! So you know nothing? - Come with us!
- We'll make you talk!

819
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:04,166
You stick a driving school board and think
you can get away with this?

820
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,416
- Sir, please listen... - Sir, please...
- I honestly don't know how it got there

821
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:10,125
Do you think we do checking...

822
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,291
- ...because we have nothing better to do?
- Sir...please listen to me...

823
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,875
- Sir...it's an emergency, sir
- Hey! Give that here! Your mobile!

824
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Hand over your mobile too!

825
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Sir...there's a hard disk here

826
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:29,291
- Sir...please don't take that!
- Hey! Where are you running off to?

827
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,333
- Sir...that... - Hey. you...
- Where are you running off to?

828
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,333
- I need to take that to the airport
- What do you think you are doing? Huh?

829
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,583
- Get in...get into the car! - Sir...that
is an application - Sir, please listen...

830
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:39,541
- Sir, we need to send that to Delhi...
- Shut up and get inside...you too!

831
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,916
- In! Get inside! - Sir, please sir...
- Move! Move!

832
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:44,958
- Sir...please, please! - Gopi! - Huh?
- Get that video and stills

833
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:47,041
And move that crowd aside

834
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,083
- Sir...could I answer that call?
- No!

835
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,958
- Hello?
- You bloody fool!

836
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,791
Idiot...ass-face!

837
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:59,541
Where on earth did you take the car
and all my shooting props?

838
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:03,416
If I don't get 10 guns to the set by 10,
the director will abuse me to high heaven!

839
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,583
Sir...he is a movie Production Controller

840
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:08,625
- He's my cousin - (on phone) Just tell me
when you will get here!

841
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:11,250
- Tell me when you will get here!
Speak up! - Hey!

842
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:14,083
- What do you mean 'hey'?
- I am the CI speaking

843
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:17,208
If you're the CI...I am the Prime Minister!
Don't kid with me...

844
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:20,000
- Just tell me when you'll get here
- Just check those things again

845
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:22,416
What do you want to check, you moron?

846
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,250
Sir...this is a dummy

847
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,375
See?

848
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,291
Sir...this courier has to go on the
10 am Delhi flight

849
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:19,250
The 10 am flight? What are you saying?
It's already 9.20!

850
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,250
It's...a real emergency!

851
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,250
Very sorry...it can go on the next flight

852
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:25,625
- There is half an hour more - There is no
other way, please! - It can't be done!

853
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:27,666
- Please! - It's too late. We cannot do
anything now!

854
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,791
Sir...surely there is something you can
do! We are coming from far!

855
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,833
We can't do anything...
please stop bothering us!

856
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:34,541
- Sir please...it's an emergency...really
urgent.. - Why didn't you come sooner?

857
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,291
- It's really urgent, sir...
- No way!

858
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,791
- It has to reach Delhi by 3...
- Excuse me, please...

859
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:47,166
- Remember me?
- I...don't really...

860
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,166
You came to meet me once

861
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:52,583
- But you had to leave abruptly
-Oh...that...that day it...

862
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:55,208
- The situation was...
- Hey! It's alright!

863
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,041
Is this courier such a big emergency?

864
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,291
God, yes! Emergency is an understatement!

865
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,291
It's beyond urgent! Is there anything
you can...

866
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,916
Sir...I know this man...

867
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
- What can we do now? It's 9.20 already!
- Sir, please...

868
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,166
- Just explain it to them!
- Sir...please sir...

869
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,458
- Is there anything we can do?
- I don't think so

870
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,000
- Please try, Sir - Here...write down
the address...quick!

871
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:20,333
- Ok, sir... - Quick
- Sir...the cash!

872
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,083
Hmm...let me see!

873
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:26,208
- Just tell Antony - Ok...but I will get
scolded for sure!

874
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,291
- Now..? - Nothing...that is all...

875
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:30,958
- Thank you, sir - Thank you, sir
- Hmm...alright...

876
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,458
- It's done
- Thanks

877
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:36,541
I don't know what application that is...

878
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,583
...but I sure hope it works!

879
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,708
- Thank you!
- Ok

880
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:05,250
And our next trip here...should be
to go to Delhi for the award ceremony

881
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:10,291
- How about a cup of tea?
- Hmm?

882
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,708
And a masala dosa too!

883
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:16,041
- Ok!
- Alright!

884
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:46,583
- Hey, stop! - What?
- Come...come on!

885
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:49,083
- What is it? - Come on, quick!
- That is Aghosh!

886
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:52,000
- Who? - Aghosh Menon...the actor!
- You're kidding! - Listen...

887
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
- Are you actor Aghosh Menon?
- He is, man!

888
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,708
- Can't you see?
- It really is Aghosh Menon!

889
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:01,541
- You really are Agosh Menon, aren't you?
- Yes I am! What's your problem?

890
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:05,500
What a nuisance! Can't I do
some good deeds in peace?

891
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,125
- Well...we just happened to see you and...
- Well...this is my character!

892
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:10,791
Do I have to change my character just
because I am an actor?

893
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:12,875
Can't I just wear this holy garment...

894
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,875
...and carry out some good deeds?

895
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:18,125
What are you doing? Look here....see?

896
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:21,000
To you, these may be just packets of food

897
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,375
- But to them these are packets
of goodness...of happiness!

898
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,250
- Sir...seeing you here in this outfit...
- If I hadn't been in this outfit...

899
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:31,208
- ...would you have given me any peace?
- Sorry, sir! - And now a crowd is here!

900
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,291
I agree you made me a star
by watching my movies

901
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:37,708
But I am also a good person...
respect that too...please!

902
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,666
Brother...you are shooting this without
my permission

903
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,166
Please...delete it!

904
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,250
If you don't delete this,
I will never again to be able to...

905
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:48,333
...go out like this and help the poor!
Delete it, please!

906
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:50,250
An actor is also a human being!

907
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,541
Everyone delete it, please!

908
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:55,083
An actor is also a human being...please!

909
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,291
Please!

910
00:59:56,416 --> 00:59:59,166
Actor goes viral on social media!

911
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:02,125
To a society that is growing more
self-centred and losing its humaneness...

912
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:05,500
...this video sets an example!
Young sensation Aghosh Menon...

913
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,791
...has awakened our collective conscience..

914
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:11,083
...and inspired not just stars but
people in all walks of life...

915
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:14,375
...to take this up as a challenge, says
Bollywood star Alia Bhatt...

916
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,708
...on Twitter. It was his
selfless plea to delete the video...

917
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,458
...that prompted him to congratulate
Agosh Menon...

918
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:23,833
...says cricketer Rohit Sharma

919
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:28,666
Of all our plans so far,
this is the biggest hit!

920
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,333
It's not just viral...it's crazy viral!

921
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:35,041
So many biggies tweeting about it...
it's almost beyond our imagination!

922
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,583
And the performance by you four...
it was sensational!

923
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,500
- No one recognised you! - Thank you!
Thank you, sir! - You...come here!

924
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:45,083
I have switched off my ringtone!
If I turn it on, I may go crazy!

925
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:48,708
He may look tiny...but this idea was his...
imagine that!

926
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,583
I expect these kind of ideas from
all of you!

927
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,750
I pay you all the same!

928
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:56,375
So as a motivation to you all...

929
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:59,791
...I am gifting Sreejith my own gold chain!

930
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,416
- Great! Great! - And that's not all...
the latest ...- Hello - Hello Aghosh...

931
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:08,166
- This is Prakash - Oh...I will hand him
the phone - Sir...it's Prakash sir...

932
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,625
- Happy? - Just a second, guys!
Just a second!

933
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:15,416
- Yes, Hello? - That was a good idea...
- Aghosh...that was great, man!

934
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,083
No one thought so much...so highly...

935
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:22,416
- ...of you! - Oh Sir!
I have been hearing this all morning!

936
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:24,583
- By the way...our script...?
- Ah yes!

937
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:27,666
I am halfway through the script...
Now that I have this all-India fame...

938
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:31,666
...I am told not to restrict myself to the
South...to move on to North India...

939
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,750
- We could up our budgets too
- Oh...

940
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,583
I will spend as much as the script demands

941
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:38,708
- The demand is what we set, Sir!
- Huh?

942
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,833
- Yes!
- Oh...Ok, ok...

943
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
- Ok, Sir...
- Ok, sir... I will put him on...

944
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,250
I shouldn't have called...

945
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,125
- Sir...it's Sreeshant...
- Sreeshant?

946
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:52,833
Sri! Are you throwing the ball alright?

947
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,916
Where are you? How are you?

948
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:56,958
Speak, bugger!

949
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:00,458
What's with the suitcase, sir?

950
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:03,458
These are my memories!

951
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,750
See...look at this...my first ever
railyway ticket

952
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:09,208
- Come on, sit
- Ok

953
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,291
The first watch I ever bought...

954
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:13,333
...my camera...

955
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:17,000
...mobile phone...and this...

956
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,750
This is from Vahini Studios...

957
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:22,750
Sivaji Ganesan sir was smoking this cigar
and I begged him to let me have it

958
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,833
With the mad craze
that I have for movies...

959
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,958
...I am not an actor who should
have been cast away like this!

960
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,375
I also had a team with a makeup man
and personal assistants

961
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,583
I would pay them Rs. 25
if they asked for Rs. 20

962
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:38,708
That is something I learned from
Prem Nazeer

963
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:41,791
He would always say...
the growth of those around us...

964
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,916
...it automatically makes us grow too

965
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:47,000
- Why did you ask me to come, Sir?
- Oh yes

966
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:51,125
Could you...

967
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,333
- go the liqour store...
- Huh?

968
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:55,416
- and buy me a bottle?
- For who? - For me

969
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,083
- And don't let Sri Ranjini know
- Right

970
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,208
You will not be drinking a bottle
that I bought for you!

971
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,083
Sir...Prakash sir sent me here...

972
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:08,416
- ...to be of assistance to you
- Enough with the big talk!

973
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,625
- Will you buy it for me or not?
- No, sir

974
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,666
Sorry

975
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,416
You just said...when those around us grow..
we grow too

976
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,083
I haven't heard of anyone who grew
by turning alcoholic

977
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:34,083
Today on Give and Take
with Mirchi RJ Nilja...

978
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,666
...we have young star, Aghosh Menon

979
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:39,041
- Thank you
- Sir...you've had many hits in a row

980
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,708
And even with movies made on a
low budget...

981
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,750
- ...you manage to get super duper hits!
- Very true!

982
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,500
And then in between, there was
a movie with great artistic value...

983
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:49,541
...that was running strong in the theatres
but was taken off abruptly...

984
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:51,666
How did that affect you?

985
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:54,000
I am referring to 'A nearby horizon'

986
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,125
I got that...actually...

987
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,583
I am not the hero in that movie...
it was senior actor...

988
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,375
...Mohan Kumar sir...The director...

989
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:05,291
...tried to put me in an off beat movie
and pass it off as new-gen

990
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
- And...?
- Well, I was all for it

991
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:09,583
But each movie has it's own fate

992
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,666
But still, sir...when a movie is running
as a super hit...

993
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:14,916
...and drawing audiences...
for it to abruptly fall...

994
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:18,875
When the going is good...
even P T Usha...

995
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,500
...may trip and fall!

996
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,791
There is nothing we can do about it!
But....

997
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:28,083
...a movie in which I was a solo hero...
the one called 'Blankets...Blankets'...

998
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,375
- ...is a super hit... - This is Aghosh's
interview? He is marketing it very well!

999
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,875
Pull over...

1000
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
(Aaghosh talks in background)
- Excuse me, could you call Nimmy?

1001
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,041
- Hey! Call Nimmy for me?
- Ok!

1002
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,291
Please be seated, ma'am

1003
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:45,375
- If I may ask... - Please!
- At a time when you are delivering hits...

1004
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:47,708
...what made you change your name to
Aghosh Menon?

1005
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,750
Good question! Now he will talk about us!

1006
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:51,708
True! Turn up the volume

1007
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,666
Aghosh Menon is my real name

1008
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:55,625
If you want, you can check my certificates

1009
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:57,666
- Is that true? - Isn't it?
- Of course!

1010
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,958
So why Krupesh?

1011
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
About...Krupesh...

1012
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,333
Ten years ago I met a Sanyasi*
(*sage)

1013
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,083
- Ok...
- At Varanasi...

1014
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,541
He said, your name should have
'Grace' in it...

1015
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,583
- ...and named me Krupesh* (*Lord of Grace)
- Oh! - Bloody donkey!

1016
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:15,333
- Idiot!
- So what made you change your name now?

1017
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,875
He died in an auto accident last week
at Guruvayoor

1018
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,750
- Oh no! - It was in the local editions
of all the newspapers

1019
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:27,000
- You...you are very funny, Sir!
- Funny?

1020
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:31,000
- What do you mean funny? - I...meant...
- Is it funny to you that someone died?

1021
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,041
- That's not what I....
- So sad!

1022
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,375
Pathetic!

1023
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,458
No wonder people call him Kapeesh!

1024
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:38,875
After all those suggestions we gave!

1025
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,791
- Oh, sir... - Bye!
- Bye, sir. Thank you

1026
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,875
- Yes?
- What?

1027
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,750
Weren't you going to ask him something?

1028
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,958
Want a selfie or something? Go ahead!
I am a down-to-earth guy!

1029
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,458
- Go ahead! He's really nice!
- But I didn't ask anything

1030
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:57,541
Hey! Isn't this Mohan Kumar Sir's daughter?

1031
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,791
- Which Mohan Kumar?
- The one who acted with you...

1032
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,375
We met her once in the theater

1033
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:06,416
- Oh! Why are you acting like a stranger?
- Yes, why?

1034
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,083
- Why do you do that, huh? - Your dad
must be upset about the movie, right?

1035
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,416
- So sad! - It made me sad too!
- Of course, of course!

1036
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,291
I have committed so many movies!
I could recommened him, right? - Oh yes!

1037
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:16,541
He's not just saying it...he really
will recommend him!

1038
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:19,000
- He's helped out so many, you know!
- So...

1039
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:23,041
- ...nice meeting you - Ok
- Convey my condolences to your father

1040
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,125
Ok? Thank you!

1041
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,875
Please convey mine too, ok?

1042
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,833
- What a grip that was, Sir!
- Huh?

1043
01:06:30,916 --> 01:06:33,166
Maybe you shouldn't let go at all!

1044
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,916
- What do you mean?
- She is the perfect girl for you to marry!

1045
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:39,666
Stop wasting your time with Brighty and...

1046
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,583
- ...try this one instead!
- She's not bad to look at!

1047
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,833
Perfect family background! Great match!

1048
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:49,250
Also...a movie star can get married
to another star's daughter

1049
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:51,916
That makes for a great cinema family!

1050
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:55,416
- Shall I talk to her then?
- No! No! Now it is on the correct note

1051
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,750
That bit of English
you threw in at the end...

1052
01:06:57,958 --> 01:06:59,958
- ...has left her flat out impressed!
- Really? - Yes!

1053
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:11,541
- Hey! - Hello, brother...
- Hey! Look who is here!

1054
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:16,333
- The young, charming producer of superhit
movies... - Are you asking how I got here?

1055
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:18,458
Come on, brother! Say something new!

1056
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,750
Come in...let's sit here...

1057
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:23,250
- I heard from Prakash...
- What? - About...

1058
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:27,083
-...the National Award - Oh...we have
applied, that's all - And you will win!

1059
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:29,416
You have put in the work to deserve it!

1060
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:33,166
It will be a slap in the face to those who
tried to pull you down...

1061
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:36,083
...God forgive me!...when you win
this award, mark my words

1062
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:38,083
Let me tell you why I am here

1063
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,000
The Sunday after next...

1064
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:42,166
...there is a celebration to mark
100 days of my movie

1065
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,583
You have to come and bring Srikutty too!
Also, you will be...

1066
01:07:45,666 --> 01:07:47,666
...handing out a few mementos...
and speaking a word or two...

1067
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,375
- Why do you laugh, brother?
- Well...

1068
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,416
...I have been around all this time...

1069
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:57,333
No one ever invited me to any such event...
I wasn't even aware of anything

1070
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:01,541
Brother...in movies...all that matters
is where you are now...

1071
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,291
There are many resting on past glory

1072
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:06,791
But you shouldn't be among them, ok?

1073
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,750
It's when you show up for such events...
that people know you are still around

1074
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:14,208
Cinema offers us no privilege
that we don't make for ourselves

1075
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,958
That's true

1076
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:20,375
- I will come
- Good!

1077
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:23,791
Could you center that please?

1078
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:27,041
- Give it to me!
- Huh?

1079
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:31,458
Hey you! Everything is looking so dark!
Increase the exposure, will you?

1080
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,041
- It's at maximum, Sir
- Who do you think you are talking to?

1081
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,416
When I ask you to turn it up, just do it!
Or should I do it myself?

1082
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,916
- Ok...turn it up! - I did
- Increase it some more

1083
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:42,541
- (muttering) What a nuisance!
- You see, Sir?

1084
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:46,125
I have to be involved in everything,
if things are to go well!

1085
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,750
- Hmm - The strain on me is really huge!
- Of course!

1086
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,500
Hey you! Don't you understand?

1087
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:56,291
Do you want me to come up there? It's not
like you have to bring light from home!

1088
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:58,583
- We can't do anything more, Sir
- It's at maximum? - Yes

1089
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:01,166
Turn it up! See this, Sir?

1090
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,375
What we can clearly see, he can't!

1091
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:06,416
- What to do with these guys?
- If you remove those glasses, Aghosh...

1092
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
- ...it might look ok
- Huh?

1093
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:13,791
Good Lord!

1094
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,750
I have made such mistakes too,
when wearing these kinds of glasses

1095
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:22,291
- You have?
- Yes! Many times! - Ok

1096
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:29,458
- Why are you here again?
- About the next step for our project...

1097
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,666
Oh yes! I read the script

1098
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:35,666
- The hero and his two brothers, right?
- Yes - So...three characters

1099
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:39,291
And there is enough space for all three
to perform fantastically

1100
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:43,000
- And we can't predict which one will
work out in the theatres - Correct

1101
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,250
- Aghosh has gone deep into the script
- Yes

1102
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,291
So I was thinking...I can play all three!

1103
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:52,875
- Since they are brothers, it's ok
if they look the same, right? - Uh...

1104
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,125
Yes! For one...

1105
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:57,375
...we can have a trim hair look

1106
01:09:57,625 --> 01:10:01,125
The second...can have eyeliner...
and wear an ear ring...

1107
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,250
...a bit of feminine attitude...
I haven't done that before...

1108
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,541
So that will give us some variety...
and it will make my fans happy!

1109
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:10,000
- Right? You must have seen Sivaji Ganesan
in Daiva Makan? - I have

1110
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:13,416
- That's what I have in mind - Huh?
- Oh no...that wouldn't work

1111
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:18,291
Don't worry...we can make
all of them distinct

1112
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:21,375
I will kill with my acting...
take Kamal Hassan for instance...

1113
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,458
...he has played around 20 characters
in a movie!

1114
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:27,375
It will be great! And you can dub
the movie in Tamil and Kannada too!

1115
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:30,041
- True! - He is getting many enquiries
from those industries, right?

1116
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:32,791
So many! If you are ok with it,
we can start the movie immediately

1117
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:35,750
Uhh...we need some think to think

1118
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:37,916
Just for you, I can make one more offer

1119
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,583
- What is that? - Don't pay me for three.
Just pay me for two characters!

1120
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:43,583
- Oh...
- Wow! What an offer you are getting!

1121
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,958
- Take two, get one free!
- That's right!

1122
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,875
- Think about it and let me know - Ok
- I'll see you later, ok?

1123
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:55,416
Alright, where is the director? Get him
fast! I need to leave for that reality show

1124
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
What do you think?

1125
01:10:57,583 --> 01:11:00,458
Sir...I would rather throw my script
under a running train

1126
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:03,375
- Are you done thinking? Huh?
- I...

1127
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,333
(humming)

1128
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:15,125
- Here... - Oh...no...
- This is not to get drunk with! - No, no!

1129
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:17,916
I haven't touched a drop in 4 years!

1130
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You are one to talk!

1131
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:23,333
You be quiet!

1132
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:26,125
- It is the naming ceremony
for my 4th child - Oh

1133
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,666
The three older ones are girls...I won't
let them suffer because of me!

1134
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,666
- Here...take this too..
- Oh no...no! That is not necessary!

1135
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:36,583
Keep it! And bring your mother back
next week, ok?

1136
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,875
I know it's not right to have her
working at her age

1137
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:41,583
Huh? Who said I am a worker here?

1138
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:44,416
- Am I, Sir?
- Of course not! You are family!

1139
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:48,500
Also...by the time I come back, I guess we
will know about your award?

1140
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,666
Oh yes! Mom told me about that!

1141
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,708
Wait and watch! This time the award
will be yours!

1142
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:55,375
- Thank you! - We will take our leave
- See you soon - Come, Mom

1143
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:57,625
Come...give me that

1144
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,625
Careful...careful now...

1145
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:02,791
- Goodbye, Sir
- Bye

1146
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,958
- Your eyes seem wet, Sir
- It's...nothing

1147
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,541
Even if it's only for a few days...
when people around you say bye...

1148
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:14,083
...it's hard for me

1149
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:16,916
- What's in that cover?
- Oh! I forgot!

1150
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,166
There was a courier for you

1151
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,458
- Courier? For me?
- Yes

1152
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,750
Mohan Kumar. Cine Actor.

1153
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,875
Wonder who sent me something by courier!

1154
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:27,958
And there is no 'from' address

1155
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:39,666
- That's a big build-up, Sir! - It's harder
to open a package than it is to send it!

1156
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,833
Must be a mobile phone or something

1157
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:48,125
Oh God!

1158
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:07,500
So a rooster head, some rotten eggs...

1159
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:10,125
...and a sacred talisman is what's got
you troubled

1160
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:13,208
It's black magic! I have lost
my peace of mind!

1161
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,625
Even before...it was black magic someone
used againt me...

1162
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:20,166
...that made me lose my stardom...a famous
astrologer told me that

1163
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:23,291
If black magic could cause stars
to lose their stardom...

1164
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:28,041
...Mammootty and Mohanlal would have been
out of work long back!

1165
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,333
Surely they have enemies too!

1166
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:32,416
I...that's...but...

1167
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,875
...is there any way to balance
this black magic?

1168
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:36,916
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes!

1169
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:40,500
- Deeply!
- If just a rooster head and rotten eggs...

1170
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,375
...can beat down your God,
what a lousy God that must be!

1171
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:51,375
- That's true
- The dark clouds within you...

1172
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,458
...seem to have partly cleared now

1173
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:56,458
A title...a recognition...

1174
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,666
...seems to be headed your way

1175
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:01,125
If that reaches you...

1176
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:04,208
...you will be a whole new person.
Nothing can stop you anymore!

1177
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,625
- How's your singing going?
- Good

1178
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:12,833
It's going well, Brother...
I have a shoot tomorrow

1179
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:15,041
- But it's not singing...it's a dance round
tomorrow, right? - Yes

1180
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,875
These days, to be a singer, you
also need to dance

1181
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,083
But thankfully you don't have to sing
to be a dancer!

1182
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,333
1,2,3...action!

1183
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,791
Sweet bloom with a honeyed voice

1184
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:53,833
Let's make some music in the red skies

1185
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:03,041
Sweet bloom with a honeyed voice

1186
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:06,083
Let's make some music in the red skies

1187
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:09,166
See the delicate flowers in the garden

1188
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,166
Let's sing and keep them company

1189
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,291
Pretty flower, nectar of jasmine

1190
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:18,500
With your beautiful, fluttering doe eyes

1191
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,375
When the pretty flower came to you

1192
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:24,041
Did you end up stealing her heart?

1193
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,916
Oh Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine!

1194
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Bring me a honey pot of dreams!

1195
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:33,041
Oh flash of lightning!

1196
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:36,125
Oh sandal laden breeze!

1197
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:57,916
Sweet bloom with a honeyed voice

1198
01:15:58,041 --> 01:16:01,041
Let's make some music in the red skies

1199
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:04,125
See the delicate flowers in the garden

1200
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:07,083
Let's sing and keep them company

1201
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:28,458
Like a blue peacock in my dreams

1202
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:31,500
Did you wait for the warm summer breeze?

1203
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:34,458
In the honey of my heart

1204
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:37,291
Were you the touch of sweetness?

1205
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:40,625
The grove is filled with delighful beats

1206
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,666
White clouds join in by the river banks

1207
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:46,375
The grove is filled with delightful beats

1208
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:50,041
White clouds join in by the river banks

1209
01:16:50,166 --> 01:16:53,833
With not a word to anyone,
a star reaches out

1210
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:58,500
Oh Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine

1211
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:01,333
Bring me a honey pot of dreams

1212
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:04,583
Oh flash of lightning

1213
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:07,666
Oh sandal laden breeze

1214
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:22,916
Oh Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine

1215
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,708
Bring me a honey pot of dreams

1216
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,000
Oh flash of lightning

1217
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:31,833
Oh sandal laden breeze

1218
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,750
The English men are taking me away

1219
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:17,916
- To them, my patriotism is treachery
- Oh no!

1220
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:20,291
I doubt I will ever come back

1221
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,625
Take him!

1222
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,833
Now sit

1223
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,750
Good!

1224
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,750
Very good...cut it!

1225
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:41,625
- Sir, please sit - No, it's ok, I'll stand
- I'll be with you when this shot is done

1226
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:46,291
We are done, honey! It's done!

1227
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,333
You were good...we got the shot...

1228
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,625
Could someone please...tell her?
And take her away?

1229
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,583
- Yes, sir - It's ok! We got it!
For God's sake... - Come...

1230
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,625
- The camera is off, right? - It's been off
for a while - I'll be right with you

1231
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:01,000
I'll wait out

1232
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:03,958
That's enough...you can stop now

1233
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,833
- How did I do? Did anyone catch on?
- Oh no!

1234
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,833
I have got it all on the phone

1235
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:11,416
It's sure to go viral on social media

1236
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:14,458
Great for mileage...and you'll get
a lot of fans too!

1237
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,916
Actor Shreya Lakshmi...unable to get
out of her character's skin

1238
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:20,041
- That should be the caption, ok?
- Yes

1239
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:23,125
Wah! Can I suggest a few captions too?

1240
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:27,916
Listen...I have been in this industry
for about 12 years now

1241
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,250
And I have seen many people like you

1242
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,583
If you put in half the effort...

1243
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,708
...into some honest acting,
you can survive longer in the field

1244
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:38,375
Sorry, sir...please don't tell anyone

1245
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:41,458
I won't...but you seriously think
no one got that?

1246
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:43,625
Alright then!

1247
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:45,500
- We shouldn't have
- Ya...

1248
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:47,583
- Prakash Cheta, hi again - Hi
- Please sit

1249
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:51,625
New stupidities
of the social media age, right?

1250
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,666
It's like going viral is what feeds
some people, these days!

1251
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,458
- Prakash Cheta...I read the script
- Ok?

1252
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:00,833
It's fantastic! I loved it!

1253
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:02,750
That's why I asked to meet

1254
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:05,083
All three characters are awesome

1255
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:07,208
And each needs to be performed differently

1256
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,208
You and the director can decide
which one I should do

1257
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,458
Thank you, Asif

1258
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:15,333
This project is my last hope

1259
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,583
Hey! Prakash Cheta...

1260
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:20,833
It's not about money-making...
it's your love for the movies...

1261
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:23,041
...that's making your eyes fill up

1262
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:26,666
We can start...maybe in June - July?

1263
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:30,750
- Is that fine? - Yes - And don't bother
about my remuneration right now

1264
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,958
But...there should no compromise
in production

1265
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,958
Of course!

1266
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:38,500
This movie will be great, Prakash Cheta!
And I will support you all the way

1267
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:41,333
Truly!

1268
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,833
Because we are together all the time,
people are talking about us

1269
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:55,041
If the media asks...say it's a
brotherhood relation...

1270
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,041
...and I consider you like my sister

1271
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:59,041
Or it could affect both our careers

1272
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:02,666
- Madam! - Oh Sorry! We did not know!
- I said you were in an urgent meeting

1273
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,541
Sorry, Sir!

1274
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:07,458
What are you sorry for?
We are just in a brotherhood relation

1275
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,666
- Right?
- Yes...but...a minute, please?

1276
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:13,083
- Where were you? - Why are you here?
- There's something important

1277
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:17,166
- The Production Controller called
- What about? - Prakash Sir has got...

1278
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,125
- ...Asif Ali's dates for his movie!
- Oh no!

1279
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,708
Yes, it is true...it's out of our hands

1280
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,708
- Wait...let's do one thing...
- Yes? - Today evening...

1281
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:27,708
...during the 100th day celebration,
I will announce it as my movie on stage

1282
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:31,416
And make sure you pay enough people
to applaud non-stop when I say it

1283
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,666
- Ok? Let's do that!
- Madam...sorry!

1284
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,791
Why do you keep saying sorry?
Didn't I say she is like my sister?

1285
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:40,041
Sorry!

1286
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,708
(mutters)
Hope this 'brotherhood' doesn't go viral!

1287
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,333
This year's super hit movie...

1288
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,583
...'Blankets, Blankets'...

1289
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:50,625
...is celebrating 100 days of release today

1290
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,875
And now I call upon the Producer
of the movie...

1291
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,875
...our dear Nandakishor Sir

1292
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,208
- You did great! - Bro!
- Congrats!

1293
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:06,333
I call upon eminent Producer Prakash Sir
to speak to the gathering

1294
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:09,333
There was something in this movie....

1295
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:11,375
...that appealed to the common man

1296
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:15,375
That's what this victory means.
When a common man can relate...

1297
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:18,875
...that is when the depth and impact
of an art of work increases

1298
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:22,125
Many who worked on this movie...

1299
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:25,125
- ...were given mementos here today
- Dad? - Huh? - Krishnanunni's here

1300
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:28,541
- Hey! - What? - Come sit here!
- When you see the mementos later...

1301
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:31,458
- ...the memories related to this movie...
- No, thank you!

1302
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:35,166
...will come to your mind. The joy
is much greater...

1303
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:38,041
...when you have acted in one movie...
and it does well...

1304
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:41,333
...and you win a State or National award...

1305
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:43,166
...for your efforts

1306
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,958
This movie produced by my friend
Nandakishor...

1307
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,750
...is an unapologetic commercial movie

1308
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:52,458
But the movie a dear friend of mine
acted in...

1309
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,625
...'A Nearby Horizon' was a class movie

1310
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,416
I am sure many of you have seen it

1311
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,875
Before it could succeed as it deserved...

1312
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:04,083
...it was forced out of the theatres

1313
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:10,041
If you are wondering why I am talking
about this now...

1314
01:23:10,708 --> 01:23:14,375
...in 4 days time, this year's
National Awards will be declared

1315
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:19,333
The dear friend I was talking about...

1316
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,916
...the famous actor...very humbly...

1317
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:25,083
...sits before us today

1318
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,625
Yes!

1319
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,875
With great restraint...and clarity...

1320
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,958
...he brought his character to life

1321
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,416
I have no doubt he is going to win
the National Award...

1322
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,500
...for Best Actor!

1323
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:48,375
- Heard that?
- For his excellence in acting...

1324
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:51,750
...let's give him...a huge round
of applause!

1325
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:56,708
Thank you!

1326
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,250
- Congrats! - Thanks!
- And now the hero of this movie...

1327
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:07,291
...young sensation Aghosh Menon! Let's
welcome him with a huge round of applause!

1328
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,791
I am happy! I am so very happy today!

1329
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,708
To be honest, I have never done a movie...

1330
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:18,125
...with the intention of winning an award!

1331
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:22,541
But the words Prakash Sir said today...
about me and my acting...

1332
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,625
...fills me with hope

1333
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,291
I know the National Award is no longer...

1334
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:29,166
...called the Bharat Award...but I...

1335
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:31,208
...still like to call it that.
Bharat Gopi...

1336
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:33,250
...Bharat Mammootty...Bharat Mohanlal...

1337
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,333
...Bharat Chandran...and now...

1338
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,541
...to have that prefix to my name too...

1339
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:41,541
I want to thank Prakash Sir for showing me
that dream!

1340
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:44,875
Bharat Aghosh Menon!

1341
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,125
Prakash Sir's next movie...

1342
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,250
...will have me playing three characters!

1343
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:54,416
Triple role!! That is another happy news...

1344
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,458
...that, with your permission, Sir...

1345
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:58,500
...I would like to formally announce!

1346
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,541
Give us a big round of applause!

1347
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:04,375
- There's no going back now!
- Well, we might go back a bit

1348
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:08,166
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1349
01:25:08,791 --> 01:25:11,250
Someone I respect a lot...
the hero of yesteryears...

1350
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:14,458
...Mohan Kumar...acted as my father
in that movie...

1351
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:18,083
I believe he has also done
a fairly good job

1352
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:22,375
- Don't you think so? - Yes, yes
- I seek his blessings too

1353
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,583
That is my humble request...
and with that...

1354
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:27,083
...I wind up my humble speech

1355
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:29,125
Glory be to the Soldier!
Glory be to the Farmer!

1356
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,041
Thank you! Thank you!
Love you! Love you all!

1357
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:34,166
Thank you!

1358
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:38,541
Now we are at the end
of the formal function

1359
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:42,166
- The food counters are open. Please do eat
in before you leave...thank you! - Sir?

1360
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,541
- May I take your leave? - Ok
- I had no idea...

1361
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:49,333
...you liked my character so much!

1362
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:52,625
I liked that! And when our three-role
project is out, I will hit the next level

1363
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:55,041
And so will you! Also...

1364
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:57,583
...there was something I wanted to ask
you. I will come home some time...

1365
01:25:57,708 --> 01:26:01,250
- You can ask me now
- No...I need to come home and ask

1366
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,333
- Is it? - Yes
- Ok, then

1367
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:07,166
- Shall we make a move? Have a drink
before you leave - No!

1368
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:09,958
- SRK's team is waiting
- Who?

1369
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,166
- Shah Rukh Khan's - My God!
- Oh...

1370
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,250
They are thinking of...a movie in Malayalam
with me as hero...

1371
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:18,125
It will be called the 'Lord of the Manor'

1372
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:20,083
They are waiting with the contract...

1373
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:23,166
...and dinner afterwards at Meridian...
Shah Rukh will be upset if I don't go...

1374
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:26,208
- So...you guys carry on, ok?
- All the best!

1375
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,125
All the best! I will be coming
to your house soon!

1376
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,250
- Ok, Ok
- Ok

1377
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,333
- See you - Ok
- Come quick, please, Brighty

1378
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:36,291
- Shall I ask them to bring the car around?
- Is Shah Rukh Khan so jobless these days?

1379
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:38,583
Lord of the Manor?

1380
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,625
- He must be making it up!
- Come

1381
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,708
- Let's go over there
- Yes...that's better

1382
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:46,125
It's after a long while I am seeing
all of you together

1383
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:49,375
So today we drink to 'Blankets'

1384
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:52,916
'Blankets' is done...and he made money

1385
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,958
- True
- As Prakash said...

1386
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:58,875
...we will drink to the National Award
that is coming to Mohan!

1387
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:01,625
- That's right! - My dear Ravi Ettan!
First let me win it!

1388
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,083
- Then we can celebrate
- We are sure you are going to win

1389
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,125
- That's why we say it
- If you don't win for this one...

1390
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,250
...I will put an end...

1391
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:11,541
- ...to my cinema production
- Me too!

1392
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:16,208
- Let's drink to that! - Yes!
- Cheers!

1393
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:25,958
Can I tell you both something?

1394
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:29,125
Well, there are only the two of us here...
so go ahead and speak

1395
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:32,958
As all those guys were saying...

1396
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:35,333
...if I do win this award...

1397
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:38,416
- Yes?
- ...we should go on a trip

1398
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:43,375
Far....somewhere far away...

1399
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,625
Somewhere that there is snow...
and mountains...

1400
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:50,250
It's been my dream for a long time

1401
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:53,583
- You should come along too
- Me? - Will you?

1402
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:57,375
Krishnanunni must be wondering...
how much you've had to drink today

1403
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:59,875
- You are so drunk, Dad!
- Oh...get lost...you!

1404
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:03,416
(Mohan starts singing an old song)

1405
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,375
- Ok Sir - Good night!
- Ok...

1406
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Honey...

1407
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:31,083
Dad...what is it?

1408
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:34,208
Dad...what happened?

1409
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:36,500
- Kichu! - Huh?
- Dad!

1410
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:39,291
- Oh no! Sir!
- Dad!

1411
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:43,166
- Sir!
- Dad...what is happening?

1412
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:14,666
It's a massive attack...

1413
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:16,833
It is past the stage of doing
an angioplasty

1414
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Besides he is diabetic too

1415
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,250
There are three blocks in his heart

1416
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,791
So...24 hours...

1417
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:27,250
...will be very critical

1418
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:29,291
If he can get through that...

1419
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:31,416
...we could do a by-pass surgery
in 3 - 4 days

1420
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:35,000
- It has to be done
- It can't be done immediately?

1421
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:37,708
He had a massive cardiac arrest

1422
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:40,583
The nerves that lead to his heart
are very weak

1423
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,708
So the risk element is really high

1424
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,208
Honey...don't cry...

1425
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Pray for him...that is what you
need to do now

1426
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:09,833
An endless grief awakens

1427
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:14,250
Unknowingly...by my side

1428
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:19,041
Tears bloom and fall

1429
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:23,625
Unasked...by my side

1430
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:28,458
The depths of the sea, wielding waves

1431
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:32,416
Bear down on me like summer

1432
01:30:33,416 --> 01:30:37,375
A dear, soothing melody

1433
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:41,875
Seeks a voice in me today

1434
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:46,291
An endless grief awakens

1435
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:51,083
Unknowingly...by my side

1436
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:56,041
Tears bloom and fall

1437
01:30:56,416 --> 01:30:59,958
Unasked...by my side

1438
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:04,333
Sorry...I was in a shoot...
so I just came to know...

1439
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:10,958
There are lakhs on this...
spend as much as you need...no issues!

1440
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I don't need it...thanks...
I have the money

1441
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:22,041
I think he is past
the critical condition now

1442
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:24,750
I will be here till evening...
so I want you to go home...

1443
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:26,833
...and get clothes and essentials

1444
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:29,125
I will have a room ready by then

1445
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:33,708
An unyielding silence stands afar

1446
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:37,916
Like a searing melody

1447
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:42,916
A cloud, unable to sleep

1448
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:47,166
Approaches as a shower of pain

1449
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:52,041
There is no one by my side

1450
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:56,291
Who could take your place, sweet

1451
01:31:57,166 --> 01:32:00,750
To see my hurting heart

1452
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:05,958
And wipe my flowing eyes

1453
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:10,500
As I stumble and fall on these paths

1454
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:15,166
To stand by me, kindly

1455
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:22,000
- Sorry I am late
- It's ok...you're here now...

1456
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:24,833
I am going home now...
I'll be back in the morning

1457
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,333
- I need to freshen up - Ok - The attender
in front of the ICU has my number

1458
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,833
- He'll call me if there is any emergency
- Ok

1459
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Not that there will be any emergency

1460
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:36,333
Ok...I'll see you in the morning

1461
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:40,750
- I am leaving, ok?
- Ok

1462
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,958
- Whose car is this?
- My boss's

1463
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:52,625
What's in the package?

1464
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:56,833
Just some medicines...
my son is always too busy with movies!

1465
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:01,125
- How is he now?
- Seems to be doing better

1466
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:03,291
Does a heart attack happen so abruptly?

1467
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,708
Wouldn't he have felt a chest pain
or numbing of the arm?

1468
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:08,041
He was rather drunk

1469
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:11,791
- Oh...in that case, he may not have known
- True

1470
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,250
- Want me to wash it?
- Oh no...

1471
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,333
- You have dinner and go to bed
- Ok

1472
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:18,708
Give him his dinner. I am leaving

1473
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,000
- Give me the key...I'll give it a wash
- Ok

1474
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:25,500
- Who's with the girl in the hospital?
- A friend

1475
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:28,666
There are letters and invitations
from some troupes on your table

1476
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:31,333
- Come and have dinner
- What mileage do you get on this?

1477
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:33,541
I guess...10 or 12...

1478
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:36,708
Hmm...here...wash this too!

1479
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:39,125
Oh...I see!

1480
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:48,250
(reading) Our troupe....

1481
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:52,041
Come and have dinner. Also, Brother
asked if this is yours

1482
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
(reading) National Film Award...

1483
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:14,291
- Hey! Shoby! - What?
- Where did you get this?

1484
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,333
That...was under the seat in the car

1485
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:21,375
I got it a few days ago...I saw something
about films and put it in the dashboard

1486
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,208
What happened, son? Was it important?

1487
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:49,041
How could this happen, Krishnanunni?

1488
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:51,791
Were you so careless in handling this?

1489
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,625
You did not tell me anything
about the police checking that day

1490
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:02,666
It's RC...hello?

1491
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,833
- Yes...hello
- Yes...

1492
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:08,166
- What did you find? Any chance?
- Speak to Raghu

1493
01:35:09,166 --> 01:35:11,583
Prakash...I don't know how to say this...

1494
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:15,875
I got Chaudhary to cross-verify
with several officials

1495
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:20,541
It's like we said...if we had known
at least a week before...

1496
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:22,666
...they could have somehow pushed it in

1497
01:35:23,291 --> 01:35:27,250
- So...?
- They haven't even seen the movie, Prakash

1498
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,291
The signed affidavit from the Producer...

1499
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,583
...how could that go missing?

1500
01:35:32,625 --> 01:35:35,333
How do we tell Mohan this?

1501
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,750
That's what you need to think about now

1502
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:46,208
I thought one of you would be
in front of the ICU

1503
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:50,791
Hey! He is back without any problems...
what are you crying for?

1504
01:35:51,666 --> 01:35:53,625
It's nothing, child

1505
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:57,375
It's just this uniform and stuff
that makes it look serious...it's nothing!

1506
01:35:57,916 --> 01:36:01,208
There's just a needle here for the drips...
that's all

1507
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:06,083
Why do all of you look so unhappy?

1508
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:10,083
I told you...it's nothing...see?

1509
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:12,666
I am alright

1510
01:36:16,583 --> 01:36:19,208
Come...it's nothing, honey...

1511
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:23,458
If this is how it is,
I will put him back in the ICU

1512
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:26,916
She's never seen me like this, Doctor.
That's why

1513
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:29,333
It's nothing, child...don't cry...

1514
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:33,375
By the way...the by-pass surgery is fixed
for day after

1515
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,875
Don't let him face any tension

1516
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,958
Whatever tension any one might bring...

1517
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:41,166
...it won't affect me today, Doctor

1518
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Because I am full of happiness

1519
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:46,541
Tomorrow is the biggest day of my life

1520
01:36:46,958 --> 01:36:48,916
The day the Awards will be announced

1521
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:51,375
He went to so much trouble for it!
At least...

1522
01:36:51,583 --> 01:36:53,958
...that should ensure a good result...
am I right?

1523
01:36:55,291 --> 01:36:59,416
The nurses said...even under sedation...
you were talking about the award!

1524
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:11,750
What is it? Why do you all
look so strained?

1525
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:15,875
Krishnanunni...is there something wrong?

1526
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:18,041
Tell me...whatever it is

1527
01:37:24,166 --> 01:37:25,375
Sir...

1528
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,750
- There was a small... - What?
- Krishnanunni!

1529
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:33,125
What's in a...small...award...anyway?

1530
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:35,375
Your health is most important, right?

1531
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:37,541
No...

1532
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:40,375
Right now...to me...it is not

1533
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:44,500
In my life, I have not cared for anything
more than Cinema

1534
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,958
And then...for thirty odd years...

1535
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:49,791
...I had to live like it was just a dream

1536
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:56,708
And then...God showed me mercy by giving
me this character

1537
01:37:58,416 --> 01:38:01,333
And this could be the greatest recognition
that I get for it

1538
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:04,125
Right now, that is most important to me

1539
01:38:05,458 --> 01:38:08,750
You may all think...
this is an over-expectation

1540
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:12,666
But it is not like that to me

1541
01:38:12,833 --> 01:38:14,833
It is not like that to me...

1542
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:26,916
- Yes, Dad?
- How are things?

1543
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:29,500
- He has been shifted to the room
- And did you tell him?

1544
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,208
- No
- What else can you do?

1545
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:36,583
Dad...what I was trying to do for good...
ended up...

1546
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:38,500
...so badly!

1547
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:40,583
Come on...don't get desperate now

1548
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:43,208
Your Aunt is here....
she wants to talk to you

1549
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:45,333
- Ok
- Here

1550
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:48,708
I came to know about...what happened

1551
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:51,375
I am thinking...I should tell him myself

1552
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,958
Oh no...don't do anything in haste

1553
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,375
- He has heart surgery coming up
- What else can I do?

1554
01:38:57,583 --> 01:38:59,583
I cannot really tell you what to do

1555
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:03,083
But just think that what you do
is for another's happiness

1556
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:06,000
A way will open up...it is sure to!

1557
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:08,291
I guarantee you that!

1558
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:10,125
Hmm

1559
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:15,250
You have to give it to the people in ICU

1560
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:19,291
It's like you are in the middle of the sea!
No Tv...no news...

1561
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
We won't know about anything

1562
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:25,916
What is with all of you? Why do
you look so unhappy?

1563
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:29,958
Did the doctor says it's so bad?

1564
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:34,708
Dad! Please don't worry unnecessarily!

1565
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:37,541
You are in hospital

1566
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Wouldn't all of us be sad about it?

1567
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:43,000
I am only saying you shoudn't be

1568
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:58,625
You know what I think? We should
just tell him the truth

1569
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,750
Prakash...don't be silly

1570
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:05,041
I won't let you say anything
that could upset him right now

1571
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:08,291
- God!
- Sir...

1572
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:12,125
Can I suggest a way out?

1573
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,250
My thoughts were running wild...
and suddenly something occurred to me

1574
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:18,000
When I mentioned it to Sri,
she said to discuss with all of you

1575
01:40:18,791 --> 01:40:20,791
Just get to the point now

1576
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:24,208
How would Mohan Sir come to know...

1577
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:26,208
...whether he has won or not?

1578
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,666
He has a TV in his room...
he will see it on the news

1579
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:31,375
- Yes
- What if the news on his TV...

1580
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:33,375
...was something we created?

1581
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:36,750
- What...what?
- A newscast that says Mohan Sir won

1582
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:40,291
What if we were able to shoot
that... like in the movies?

1583
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:43,875
And then...we connect it to the TV
in his room...and he watches it?

1584
01:40:43,916 --> 01:40:46,416
What foolishness, Krishnanunni!
That is your bright idea?

1585
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:48,791
Suppose we do show him something
like that...

1586
01:40:48,916 --> 01:40:50,750
...and even supposing he believes it...

1587
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:53,208
...in a few days, he will realise
the truth, won't he? What then?

1588
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:55,958
By then, his operation would be done
and he will be healthy

1589
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:58,166
That's true...but...

1590
01:41:00,375 --> 01:41:02,375
- Well, that's true...
- So...

1591
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:05,458
...if we do proceed
as per this plan...

1592
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:08,291
...can we get it all done by
evening tomorrow?

1593
01:41:08,416 --> 01:41:10,416
We can try...we can get it done somehow!

1594
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,250
No, no, no, stop! No more ideas!

1595
01:41:13,458 --> 01:41:16,750
Whatever you say, I won't let you
deceive him!

1596
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:20,416
- Sir...
- He may be terribly upset...

1597
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,500
...but I will explain things to him

1598
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,458
- Prakash...
- Sir...

1599
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,500
He has a surgery the day after

1600
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:30,166
You have to think this through

1601
01:41:34,375 --> 01:41:35,708
Sir...

1602
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:38,416
This happened because of me

1603
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:41,541
It was my carelessness

1604
01:41:41,583 --> 01:41:43,583
Let Mohan Sir go into surgery happily

1605
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:47,250
The rest...we can deal with
as it comes

1606
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:52,791
Sir, please...

1607
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:16,458
Hey...here is a list of all that you
need to get and arrange

1608
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:19,041
Studio floor can be done...
camera can be arranged...

1609
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:21,833
- Someone who can speak English well
- Mark that as important

1610
01:42:22,166 --> 01:42:24,166
All this can be taken care of

1611
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:28,166
- Hey... - Yes? - So this
is the first script I will be directing?

1612
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,041
So you're a newbie?
Over here then, Speilberg!

1613
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:34,208
Passing by in the flash of an eye

1614
01:42:34,291 --> 01:42:36,958
Like a magic trick - is life

1615
01:42:37,291 --> 01:42:40,291
Shimmering and swaying

1616
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:42,958
Like a kite - is life

1617
01:42:43,416 --> 01:42:46,416
Let's walk on without faltering

1618
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:52,541
We have battles to win with no shield

1619
01:42:55,541 --> 01:42:59,291
Unsaid, unknowing, let's transform
into flighty petals

1620
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:01,625
- Do you have everything I asked for?
- All the pictures are in here

1621
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:04,750
- In here? - Yes
- But all of them look like Malayalis

1622
01:43:04,833 --> 01:43:07,500
- But they speak Hindi well - That's not
enough...they should also look the part

1623
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,208
That's a must! I told you over the phone!

1624
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:12,041
Oh Hara*! Hari-Hara-Sutha**
(*Shiva) (**Ayyappa)

1625
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:14,333
Let us always be aware of the truth

1626
01:43:15,416 --> 01:43:18,333
Oh Hara! Hari-Hara-Sutha!

1627
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:20,458
Bless us always with peace

1628
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:24,500
Passing by in the flash of an eye

1629
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:27,458
Like a magic trick - is life

1630
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:30,541
Shimmering and swaying

1631
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:33,000
Like a kite - is life

1632
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:54,041
Like dolls in a puppet show

1633
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:57,000
Here we are, playing along

1634
01:43:57,166 --> 01:44:00,000
There is no time to waste

1635
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:03,083
Let's know the truth, in haste

1636
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:06,125
One day...one day truth will prevail

1637
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:09,208
And this tale will become a tale too

1638
01:44:09,333 --> 01:44:12,333
And amid a lot of memories

1639
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:15,333
These moments will be treasures

1640
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:19,750
Like a white feather that comes along
to a drowning person

1641
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:23,416
- I've never done this in real life before
- Us too.. - It's my first time

1642
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,375
- It's for a good cause
- Right - It's a crazy situation

1643
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,583
- Ok?
- Action!

1644
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:30,625
Oh Hara! Oh Hari-Hara-Sutha!

1645
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:33,666
Let us always know what is right

1646
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:36,583
Oh Hara! Oh Hari-Hara-Sutha!

1647
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:38,625
Bless us with peace, always

1648
01:44:46,916 --> 01:44:48,208
Thank you

1649
01:44:50,916 --> 01:44:53,291
- Hello?
- Hello...it's Krishnanunni

1650
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:55,125
Yes...how's it going?

1651
01:44:55,166 --> 01:44:57,166
Brother...I feel so guilty

1652
01:44:57,625 --> 01:45:00,458
- We are deceiving him after all
- There is no need for guilt

1653
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:02,791
Your intentions are good

1654
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:06,541
If a small wrong can bring good
to someone else...

1655
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:08,875
...God won't consider it a wrong

1656
01:45:09,666 --> 01:45:12,958
Talk to you later...call me
when it's all over

1657
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:14,708
Alright

1658
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:22,416
The National Film Awards will be
declared today

1659
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:25,666
Our reporter is joining us from Delhi
with the details

1660
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:28,833
A short while ago, a member of the Jury
told the media...

1661
01:45:28,958 --> 01:45:30,958
...that of the movies that were
in the running this year...

1662
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,291
...what caught their attention were the
unconventional themes and performances

1663
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:40,791
- In the last six years, such a unanimous..
- Who's it? - I don't know

1664
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,666
It is Aghosh...Aghosh Menon...
the young superstar...

1665
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:45,750
Oh...tell me, Sir...what's up?

1666
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:48,375
- Your Dad's surgery is tomorrow, right?
- Yes

1667
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:50,291
I am on my way there

1668
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:52,583
Is he able to talk?

1669
01:45:52,708 --> 01:45:54,541
Uhh...is it urgent?

1670
01:45:54,583 --> 01:45:56,583
Well...yes...

1671
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:00,416
- I would like to marry you...
a little bit... - What?

1672
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,916
No...I mean...I would like very much
to marry you

1673
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
What is your opinion about that?

1674
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:09,458
- Is that why you are coming here now?
- Next week is my birthday

1675
01:46:09,541 --> 01:46:12,625
I thought...before that...
we could fix things up...

1676
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,333
...and finalise it

1677
01:46:14,375 --> 01:46:16,750
And once the surgery is done,
it could take two months or so...

1678
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:18,791
...for him to recover and be able
to talk and all that

1679
01:46:18,958 --> 01:46:20,958
For the same reason that you just said...

1680
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,958
...Dad already fixed my wedding
this morning

1681
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:25,375
Oh my God! What happened...

1682
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:28,125
...to fix your wedding so suddenly?

1683
01:46:28,291 --> 01:46:30,291
Well, my Dad just felt like it

1684
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:32,791
- Pull over to the side, man
- What? Hello?

1685
01:46:33,041 --> 01:46:34,875
I was talking to someone else

1686
01:46:34,958 --> 01:46:36,958
Girl...I want to say this again

1687
01:46:37,541 --> 01:46:39,541
What you are losing...

1688
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:41,583
...is a colourful life...

1689
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:43,750
You know...big house...
plenty of cars...

1690
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,958
...glamour of stardom...and award nights...

1691
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:48,041
...an awesome...terrific life!

1692
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:50,583
Do you want to give it some more thought?
I can give you one more chance

1693
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:52,625
- What's that, Dad?
- Hello?

1694
01:46:53,083 --> 01:46:55,000
Dad's calling me...I am hanging up now

1695
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:58,458
Just tell him...that I was asking
about his health...that's all...

1696
01:46:58,791 --> 01:47:00,791
Ya, ya...sure!

1697
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,500
- That one slipped through, didn't she?
What will you do now? - Hey!

1698
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:06,708
- Just drive, will you?
- Ok!

1699
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:08,708
- Madam?
- Yes?

1700
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:10,958
When should I ask Doctor Raghu to come?

1701
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:13,083
- After ten minutes
- Ok, Madam

1702
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:15,208
Doctor...you have to create a gap

1703
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:17,541
- So we can connect this pen drive
to the TV -Ok

1704
01:47:18,333 --> 01:47:21,541
- All ok here? - Yes
- Then let me go get my surprise

1705
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:24,791
- All this happened because of me...so I
want to make amends - Ok

1706
01:47:26,458 --> 01:47:28,708
- Let's go in
- Ok...come on

1707
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:31,916
No wait...I will come in later, saying
Congrats and all that

1708
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:33,875
You go in now

1709
01:47:36,125 --> 01:47:38,125
Ok...all the best!

1710
01:47:39,166 --> 01:47:40,500
Oh God!

1711
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:43,625
Are you glued to this all the time?

1712
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:46,666
The awards will be declared now.
That's why I am glued to it

1713
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:55,500
Ok...I need to give you an injection...
let's get over with quickly

1714
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,500
- Just turn around
- Ok

1715
01:47:58,666 --> 01:48:00,666
Isn't it nurses who usually
give injections?

1716
01:48:00,916 --> 01:48:04,666
- Why are you doing it yourself, Doctor?
- Just so it wouldn't hurt too much

1717
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:12,708
Ouch! This is what you call hurting less?

1718
01:48:15,166 --> 01:48:18,541
- Hey! Don't change the channel
- My hand slipped on the remote, Dad

1719
01:48:18,666 --> 01:48:20,666
Ok...just set it back to the news channel

1720
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:23,916

See?

01:51:15,875 --> 01:51:17,875
I told you about a surprise

1771
01:51:19,041 --> 01:51:22,000
How could it...be in the papers?
It was just declared now

1772
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:27,750
Oh...let me see...this is an evening
paper!

1773
01:51:27,916 --> 01:51:31,708
It says "Mohan Kumar is in contention

1774
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:33,833
- That is what it says - Oh..,
- In contention?

1775
01:51:33,875 --> 01:51:36,083
- What are you reading out?
- Yes...that is what it says

1776
01:51:36,166 --> 01:51:38,708
- That is not what it says... - Yes it is
- See, it says 'won' - Let me see

1777
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:42,500
- Can I see it? - It is right here
- Give it to him...or he'll think its a lie

1778
01:51:42,666 --> 01:51:45,208
- It is written here - Let him see it
- Give it here!

1779
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:47,416
Can I just see it?

1780
01:51:47,791 --> 01:51:51,041
- Just give it to him...what's with
the slow motion? - Pass me my glasses

1781
01:51:51,625 --> 01:51:53,625
- Ok
- Hello, Mr Mohan!

1782
01:51:57,625 --> 01:51:59,625
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, doctor!

1783
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:02,958
So you will cooperate with me tomorrow,
without any tension?

1784
01:52:02,958 --> 01:52:04,958
I have absolutely no tension left, Doctor

1785
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:07,791
I have a small request to you

1786
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:11,458
When I say it, no one here may agree

1787
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:13,958
So...just one minute...

1788
01:52:14,041 --> 01:52:16,041
...could you all wait outside?

1789
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:18,541
Could I speak to the doctors alone?

1790
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:21,916
- Please - Ok...come on...
- We have some other ideas too

1791
01:52:22,791 --> 01:52:24,791
You too, honey...

1792
01:52:27,291 --> 01:52:30,291
Do you have clay in place of brains?
My hands and legs were shaking!

1793
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,083
- I just wanted to give him a surprise
- Don't make me give you one!

1794
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:36,750
It's only 5 minutes since the declaration -
how could you get tomorrow's paper today?

1795
01:52:37,041 --> 01:52:39,041
- Ooh!
- This was your big surprise?

1796
01:52:39,541 --> 01:52:41,541
It was our luck the doctor walked in!

1797
01:52:41,916 --> 01:52:43,916
- Here! Take your surprise!
- Let's put it away

1798
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:49,583
I am...so happy...I am in
a state of ecstacy, doctor!

1799
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:54,041
In my life...I never thought I would win
such a big honour...

1800
01:52:54,333 --> 01:52:56,333
I didn't even dream about it!

1801
01:52:56,625 --> 01:52:58,625
On a day that I am so happy...

1802
01:52:59,291 --> 01:53:01,291
...I don't want to be lying in a hospital

1803
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:05,375
Today...just for this one day...

1804
01:53:06,791 --> 01:53:08,791
...please allow me to go home

1805
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:11,666
I just want to...see my home to my
heart's content!

1806
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:14,791
Sleep in my own room

1807
01:53:15,125 --> 01:53:18,500
Just for today...I will be back
in the morning

1808
01:53:21,708 --> 01:53:23,708
Please don't say no, doctor

1809
01:53:24,083 --> 01:53:26,541
- Mohan...your surgery is tomorrow
- What if I...

1810
01:53:26,791 --> 01:53:28,791
...never get to go again?

1811
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
It's just...

1812
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:37,333
Doctor...if God has brought me
to this situation...

1813
01:53:38,291 --> 01:53:40,291
...as He is giving me all this happiness...

1814
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:44,666
...I feel slightly scared, Doctor

1815
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:50,125
Doctor please...just this one day

1816
01:53:55,541 --> 01:53:56,541
Please!

1817
01:53:57,666 --> 01:54:01,708
A cloud that disappeared into the night

1818
01:54:01,833 --> 01:54:05,541
Turned into a torrent from my eyes

1819
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:10,708
A time that had moved far away

1820
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:15,083
Will it ever come back, this way?

1821
01:54:15,958 --> 01:54:19,625
Days filled with sweetness

1822
01:54:20,291 --> 01:54:24,125
Were like the misty mornings of December

1823
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:28,875
To be with me once more

1824
01:54:29,458 --> 01:54:33,333
Will they ever return?

1825
01:54:34,083 --> 01:54:38,250
Memories fade one by one

1826
01:54:39,041 --> 01:54:42,750
And float within me like petals

1827
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:54,750
We'll take your leave now...we will be
at the hospital in the morning

1828
01:54:55,708 --> 01:54:57,916
- Mohan...no need to get tensed
- Hmm

1829
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:01,000
Mohan...

1830
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,500
What are you thinking about, Dad?

1831
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:20,541
About you

1832
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:22,750
What else would I be thinking about?

1833
01:55:26,291 --> 01:55:28,291
If anything happens to me...

1834
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,500
...you, my child...

1835
01:55:35,208 --> 01:55:37,208
Departures hurt...

1836
01:55:38,166 --> 01:55:40,166
...not the ones who leave...

1837
01:55:41,125 --> 01:55:43,125
...but the ones around them

1838
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:45,458
The people they love

1839
01:55:53,083 --> 01:55:54,333
Great!

1840
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,208
Is this why you came home?

1841
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:01,291
Go to your room, honey

1842
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,708
Come...sit here

1843
01:56:12,208 --> 01:56:14,208
- Listen...
- Yes...

1844
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,708
I dont know why...but my mind is...

1845
01:56:18,583 --> 01:56:20,583
...harbouring a fear...

1846
01:56:21,125 --> 01:56:22,916
...that the end is near

1847
01:56:23,083 --> 01:56:26,250
- Sir...please don't...
- Just let me speak

1848
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
If something does happen to me...

1849
01:56:30,291 --> 01:56:32,291
But...sir...

1850
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,500
I want you to take my ashes...and...

1851
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:39,083
...remember once I talked...about snow...

1852
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,625
...and mountains?

1853
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:44,375
At such a place....you...

1854
01:56:46,583 --> 01:56:48,583
I know nothing will happen...but...

1855
01:56:48,625 --> 01:56:51,458
But if it does...I want you...

1856
01:56:52,958 --> 01:56:54,958
- Sir...please...
- Who else can I ask?

1857
01:56:55,458 --> 01:56:59,500
An endless grief awakens

1858
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:03,541
Unknowingly, by my side

1859
01:57:04,666 --> 01:57:09,041
Tears bloom and fall

1860
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:12,916
Unsaid, by my side

1861
01:57:41,375 --> 01:57:43,375
I know you will pray for me, Brother

1862
01:57:43,541 --> 01:57:45,541
Go and come back all freshened up,
Mohan

1863
01:57:46,166 --> 01:57:48,166
So much good has happened, Mohan

1864
01:57:48,333 --> 01:57:51,041
And it will always be so...
till the operation is over...

1865
01:57:51,291 --> 01:57:53,166
...we'll all be right here

1866
01:57:53,208 --> 01:57:55,208
Go in happiness

1867
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:57,583
- Ravi Etta...
- Yes...

1868
01:57:57,583 --> 01:57:59,583
- RC
- Hmm

1869
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:33,875
- Krishnanunni?
- Yes, sir?

1870
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:39,250
You have a good heart

1871
01:58:39,458 --> 01:58:41,458
May good befall you, always!

1872
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:49,583
Here...keep this...it is for you

1873
01:59:53,041 --> 01:59:54,708
I am not the Best Actor

1874
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:59,250
You guys are! I forgot
the pain of losing...

1875
01:59:59,416 --> 02:00:01,416
...when I saw all of your acting!

1876
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:03,791
I am actually a lucky man

1877
02:00:03,916 --> 02:00:06,833
To have people like you...
who value my happiness...

1878
02:00:07,125 --> 02:00:08,958
...more than I do!

1879
02:00:09,041 --> 02:00:11,000
Mohan Kumar Fans!

1880
02:00:11,125 --> 02:00:13,125
That's all I need!

1881
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:45,250
Cut it! Good, Sir!

1882
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:49,208
- Just good or very good?
- Very good, sir!

1883
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:51,625
- You can get up now...
-Wait, wait!

1884
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:53,875
- What?
- When you act dead in a scene...

1885
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,375
...you have to look at the camera
and smile as you get up

1886
02:01:56,625 --> 02:01:58,625
- Get the camera rolling again
- Oh...ok...

1887
02:01:58,833 --> 02:02:01,458
- Camera...roll please!
- Rolling, sir!

1888
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
- Was that ok?
- Terffic! Come over, now

1889
02:02:04,291 --> 02:02:06,291
- Are you happy, Producer?
- Very happy!

1890
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:08,375
- So when is the trip?
- Tomorrow

1891
02:02:08,416 --> 02:02:11,041
It's the same Delhi flight...the connection
is from there

1892
02:02:11,166 --> 02:02:13,916
It's good you are going...
but the temperature is in minus there

1893
02:02:14,333 --> 02:02:16,666
Don't get your throat strained.
When you get back...

1894
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:18,750
...you are singing two songs
for this movie

1895
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:31,208
- Come on up!
- Aren't you panting, sir?

1896
02:02:32,958 --> 02:02:35,333
- Mine is new!
- Oh yes! - Come

1897
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:37,625
Come on, come on

1898
02:02:39,208 --> 02:02:42,333
My dear Mohan Sir...initially,
I also felt...

1899
02:02:42,708 --> 02:02:45,333
...that awards were a big deal

1900
02:02:45,375 --> 02:02:47,333
But now I realise...

1901
02:02:47,375 --> 02:02:51,875
...among stalwarts like Naseer, Satyan,
Thikkurissi and P J Antony...

1902
02:02:52,166 --> 02:02:56,041
...Mammootty and Mohanlal who have lorded
over the Malayalam film industry...

1903
02:02:56,458 --> 02:02:59,083
...just to be an actor among them...

1904
02:02:59,166 --> 02:03:01,833
...is the greatest award you could
get, Sir

1905
02:03:02,166 --> 02:03:03,291
The greatest recognition!

1906
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:07,541
Like a thousand clouds

1907
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,583
Do watch over me

1908
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:15,666
I am as an infant

1909
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:19,625
Do protect me

1910
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:23,875
Eyes turned upward

1911
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:28,000
I stand here to sing

1912
02:03:28,625 --> 02:03:32,333
By my side, in kindness

1913
02:03:32,791 --> 02:03:36,250
Won't you listen?

1914
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:40,458
I wish the best for the tug-of-war
at Vallakkadavu

1915
02:03:40,541 --> 02:03:45,208
I pray you win the first prize
which is a bunch of bananas and 25k

1916
02:03:45,416 --> 02:03:47,916
Tug-of-war is a game where, the farther
you go back, the more you get ahead

1917
02:03:48,083 --> 02:03:51,000
I am right with you on this...
my prayers are with you

1918
02:03:51,041 --> 02:03:53,041
Your very own Aghosh Menon!

1919
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:55,125
Damn!

1920
02:03:56,458 --> 02:04:00,833
- What are you so glum about? - After our
wedding photos and video went viral...

1921
02:04:00,916 --> 02:04:03,333
- ...we haven't had anything go viral
for a while

1922
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:07,000
Likes, comments or shares...

1923
02:04:07,083 --> 02:04:09,708
- nothing is showing any progress!
- Is that all?

1924
02:04:10,125 --> 02:04:12,833
We can fix that right away...
In our hearts...

1925
02:04:13,458 --> 02:04:15,458
- ...Lalettan* (*Mohanlal)
- Lalettan!

1926
02:04:15,541 --> 02:04:17,458
- Twirling his moustache...
- Lalettan!

1927
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:19,500
- He steps up in style
- Lalettan!

1928
02:04:19,625 --> 02:04:21,625
- His lopsided walk!
- Lalettan!

1929
02:04:21,625 --> 02:04:25,375
- Lalettan! Lalettan!
- Lalettan!

1930
02:04:27,291 --> 02:04:29,625
- Next week we will do one on Mammookka*
(*Mammootty) - Wonderful!

1931
02:04:29,666 --> 02:04:31,666
What'd ya think?
