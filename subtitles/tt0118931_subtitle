1
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,089
'P.K.MISHRA, HOME MINISTER'

2
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:22,778
What are you saying?

3
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:24,695
I hope, you're not joking.

4
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,861
This is no joke, sir. I'm serious.

5
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,688
How can they get hold of
such an important thing?

6
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:32,444
I too am surprised.

7
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,903
Are you sure about it?
- Of course, sir.

8
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:37,611
I'm hundred per cent sure.
I've checked it personally.

9
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:43,653
Hello,

10
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:46,986
I wish to speak to the
Prime minister. Immediately!

11
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:57,486
This is utterly disgusting!

12
00:04:58,444 --> 00:04:59,986
All of you
are sitting here peacefully,

13
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,153
while they've spoilt our game plan.

14
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:04,736
We've lost the boat and the box.

15
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,354
I've been telling you repeatedly,

16
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:08,820
not to entrust such an
important mission, to those ***.

17
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:12,695
All that we had planned for
three long years has been ruined.

18
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:23,444
Stop it.

19
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,194
What's the matter?
- Joseph, I said stop it.

20
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:31,444
You don't realise,

21
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,945
if the government finds
out what that box contains,

22
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:42,194
they'll arrange for the army along
with the police, to protect it.

23
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,193
Then you can play video games,
to your heart's content.

24
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:48,569
I too feel it's useless to,
trust outsiders for this work.

25
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:51,528
We should try to get
the container back, ourselves.

26
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,903
We will face the consequences.

27
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,896
Do you realise now,

28
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:05,092
why I'm wary of recruiting
pretty girls in my gang?

29
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:10,195
All they have is good looks,
they don't have any brains.

30
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:11,653
Suvarna.

31
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:23,944
Let her go.

32
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,605
Didn't you hear what I said?

33
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,105
Pushkar please explain to her,

34
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:49,105
that the police
think we are terrorists.

35
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,855
They are waiting for us
at all check posts,

36
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:55,814
armed with our photographs.

37
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,939
Not that I'm scared of death,

38
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,688
I just want to
make a success of our mission.

39
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,147
We must get this work done,

40
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,861
by outsiders
instead of doing it ourselves.

41
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,123
Where will we find an outsider?

42
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:10,829
When will we use our
underworld connections?

43
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:14,323
I know a man called, Khurana.

44
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,312
He'll do our work.

45
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,355
Who is he?

46
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:21,404
Yes, Khurana is the man.

47
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:30,449
"Daud!"

48
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:41,277
"Daud!"

49
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,145
"Daud! Daud! Daud!"

50
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:03,053
I have warned you,
not to enter our locality.

51
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:05,234
Your locality?

52
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:09,861
Did your grandfather write
off this property to you?

53
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:16,695
"Daud!"

54
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:21,318
Are you going for a hockey match?
- Shut up.

55
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:25,646
Don't touch me.
- What will you do?

56
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:29,027
I said, don't push me.
- Come on, what will you do?

57
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,069
I did warn you, not to touch me.

58
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,527
Why don't you understand?
You ***. Hold on.

59
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,360
Let me get my
glares out of the away.

60
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:48,069
Didn't I tell you, let me
get my glares out of the way?

61
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,194
Yes, hit him.

62
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:52,819
I told him to allow
me to keep my glares,

63
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:55,485
yet he continued to attack me.
Come on, hit him.

64
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,277
Halt!

65
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,861
Let me keep my glares.

66
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:30,027
Wait a minute! Stop.

67
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,723
Just a moment.

68
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,382
I'm Khurana.

69
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:20,834
What I am about to tell you,
is a great secret.

70
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:23,027
It's top secret.

71
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:26,392
I don't want
anyone to know about it.

72
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:28,218
Should I leave?

73
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,425
Stop joking.

74
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,337
My goods are with the customs
department, at Indira docks.

75
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,527
It's a box
and you have to get it for me.

76
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:38,051
Will you do it?

77
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:39,645
I'll pay you Rs 100,000.

78
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,009
What's inside the box?

79
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:51,051
Gold biscuits, worth Rs 10 million.

80
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:53,633
Do you think I'm a beggar?

81
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:56,176
Rs 100,00 against Rs 10 million?

82
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,169
I won't go out and buy biscuits
at the supermarket for that money.

83
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:01,843
He wants me to be
satisfied with such a paltry sum?

84
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:03,393
All right, I'll pay you Rs 200,000.

85
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,093
Rs 300,000!

86
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,510
Rs 400,000!

87
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,301
Rs 500,000!

88
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:12,873
How much do you want?

89
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,589
One million!
- What?

90
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,451
One million?!
- Why are you screaming?

91
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,995
I thought you didn't
want anyone to know.

92
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,468
It's too much.

93
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:29,640
If you need the best man,
you should be ready to pay well.

94
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:32,633
All right but the
work should be done by tomorrow.

95
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,801
Tomorrow?

96
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,731
I'll do it day after.
- What's the problem?

97
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,508
I have to go for a haircut.
- Haircut?

98
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,928
I said, don't crack jokes.
I want the work done by tomorrow.

99
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:44,676
Okay!

100
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:46,877
You'll have to pay
Rs 200,000 more for that.

101
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,801
What? This is...
- Okay, don't worry.

102
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,271
I'll do your work tomorrow.

103
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,552
Now give me the details of the box.

104
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:11,475
Hello.

105
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:13,398
What's the matter?

106
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,009
Why did you send for me,
at this hour?

107
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,434
I have bad news, Dr Rai.

108
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:18,884
What?

109
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,260
I've just received news,

110
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,406
that the box has been
stolen from the warehouse.

111
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:26,426
What are you saying?
- Yes, it's true.

112
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:29,633
I had not posted
any security men around that place.

113
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:30,884
What?

114
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:33,552
Why didn't you arrange for security?

115
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:38,634
I thought, too much security
would draw more attention.

116
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,544
I wanted to handle
this situation very casually.

117
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:44,775
I'd planned to hand it over to the
army high command, in the morning.

118
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:45,937
But now
this problem has cropped up.

119
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,218
What shall we do now, Mr. Mishra?

120
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:51,343
I've called the police commissioner,
he is on his way.

121
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,459
Do you mean to say, you will reveal
everything to him?

122
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,343
No, Dr Rai.

123
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:57,343
I won't tell
the commissioner everything.

124
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,884
The secret might be compromised

125
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:01,093
and it will become public knowledge.

126
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,968
This may create chaos and
the situation might worsen,

127
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,301
which will be impossible to handle.

128
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:09,051
But we have to tell
the police something.

129
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,025
We'll tell them,
the box contained gold.

130
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,843
Hello, sir.

131
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:19,968
You called me here at this hour,
any problem?

132
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:22,385
I have to discuss
something important with you.

133
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:36,468
Hello.
- Sir, Shree here.

134
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:38,114
There's an emergency case,
please come soon.

135
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:44,193
Good morning, sir
- Good morning, Shree.

136
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,170
How did this robbery take place?

137
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,420
Sir, the thief cut off
the alarm connection.

138
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,295
Both the coast guards
have been suspended

139
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,759
and an enquiry is underway.

140
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,570
What was robbed?
- Gold, worth Rs 20 million.

141
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,715
Gold? This case should be
handled by the customs department,

142
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:57,243
why are we being called in?
- I have no idea.

143
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,242
They want us
to catch the thief alive.

144
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,440
I see. Any other details?
- Yes, sir.

145
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:04,454
What? - We got a photograph,
from the close circuit camera.

146
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,441
We've sent it across to all
check posts and hotels in town.

147
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:07,453
Good!

148
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:08,744
Where is the commissioner?
- He's inside.

149
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,634
Where are you?
- With the box.

150
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:41,053
Where's the box?
- Do you think I'm a kid?

151
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,743
Get the money and take your box.
Got it!

152
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:44,884
All right.

153
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:47,473
Meet me at 9 pm,
in the lobby of Hotel Paradise.

154
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:56,878
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

155
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,051
Park the car.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,669
Where's Jimmy?

157
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,086
He said, he'd be here by evening
but he hasn't turned up as yet.

158
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:04,170
What happened next?

159
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,961
He had to attend a party...
- Hello, guys.

160
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,260
I wonder, where he has disappeared.

161
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,093
Hello, Ronnie.

162
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,132
What's up?
- You tell me.

163
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:11,905
What's happening?

164
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,495
You're so late,
we were waiting for you.

165
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:14,586
Come, let's go for Mac's party.

166
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:16,045
No, I'm tired
of seeing the same girls.

167
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:17,801
There are no fresh faces.
- Why not?

168
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,915
Mac's sister
has just returned from America.

169
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:28,157
You said you wanted a fresh chick,
look there!

170
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:54,299
Hello.

171
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:58,233
Ma'am, he is talking to you.

172
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:00,538
I said, hello.

173
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:10,272
You're very beautiful.

174
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,140
Don't you think, you ought
to thank me for praising you?

175
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:24,211
Any problem?

176
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,430
Just get lost.

177
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,887
I'm asking her, not you.

178
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:31,592
I said, get lost.

179
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:03,732
Go home and apply some balm,
you'll be all right.

180
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:06,919
Then dip your hands in warm water.

181
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:08,633
Now stop crying, will you?

182
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,601
I would've managed
even without your help.

183
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,566
Don't think you are a hero.

184
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,567
Do you have a match box?

185
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,990
I do, but I won't give it to you.

186
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:22,434
I hate people
who ask for match boxes.

187
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,909
Please give me a matchbox.

188
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:29,260
I've lived
in America for twenty years.

189
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,593
Nobody asks
for match boxes in America.

190
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:34,176
Do you know why?
- Why?

191
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:36,914
All of them use lighters.

192
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:44,426
I have a matchbox
but I didn't give it to you.

193
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,378
Do you know why?
- Why?

194
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:50,124
I was waiting to share this joke
with somebody, since morning.

195
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:14,775
"Come on, challenge me,
if you have the guts?"

196
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:24,444
"Either you accept defeat,
or defeat me"

197
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:30,344
"No one could stand up against me"

198
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:35,007
"Nor could anyone defeat me"

199
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:43,836
"Whoever dared
to challenge me, lost bitterly"

200
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:47,902
"He had to leave
with his head hanging in shame"

201
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:56,730
"Don't boast so much my dear,
I can see through you"

202
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:06,884
"I'm strong enough to stand up
against you, but I won't do it"

203
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:17,301
"It's not my style,
to challenge people like you"

204
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:23,502
"People will scorn me
if I get into a fight with a girl"

205
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:30,093
"She's so dainty and frail,
even a breeze could blow her away"

206
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:25,503
"Look, I warn you,
don't jump around too much"

207
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:30,050
"You might sprain your back"

208
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:35,301
"Take care of your gentle limbs"

209
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:39,759
"I'm afraid
you might hurt your head"

210
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:45,582
"Take care of yourself
and learn a trick or two"

211
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:54,510
"Then we'll see,
who has broken limbs"

212
00:23:55,826 --> 00:24:04,761
"Don't boast so much my dear,
I can see through you"

213
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:14,593
"I'm strong enough to stand up
against you, but I won't do it"

214
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,552
"No one could stand up against me"

215
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,759
"Nor could anyone defeat me"

216
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:33,626
"Whoever dared to challenge me,
lost bitterly"

217
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:38,218
"He had to leave
with his head hanging in shame"

218
00:25:55,731 --> 00:26:05,395
"This is a simple case of,
the pot calling the kettle black"

219
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:07,981
"If you are defeated by me"

220
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:16,156
"you won't know
where to hide your face"

221
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,676
"You can't provoke me,
by your scathing tongue"

222
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:29,030
"Once I decide to do something,
no one can stop me!"

223
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:39,739
"Come on, challenge me,
if you have the guts?"

224
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:49,447
"Either you accept defeat,
or defeat me"

225
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:59,971
"It's not my style,
to challenge people like you"

226
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:06,155
"People will scorn me
if I get into a fight with a girl"

227
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:13,280
"She's so dainty and frail,
even a breeze could blow her away"

228
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,604
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!"

229
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:22,378
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!"

230
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:28,289
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!"

231
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:32,438
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!"

232
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:37,458
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!"

233
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:43,200
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!
Oh, my love!"

234
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:47,335
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!"

235
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:57,376
"Oh, my love! Oh, my love!"

236
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:08,222
Excuse me, will you
return my shirt now?

237
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,290
Yes.

238
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:15,613
You dance very well.

239
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:18,608
I used to be a good dancer
in America,

240
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,955
but I don't dance anymore.

241
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:21,885
Do you know why?
- Why?

242
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,127
Because
I don't live in America anymore.

243
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,377
I guess,
another song is about to begin.

244
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:29,979
Hands up!

245
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:47,255
Go that way. To the backdoor!

246
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,588
Everyone sit down.

247
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:53,968
Down, I say.

248
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,284
Hey! Stop!

249
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:51,611
Hands up!

250
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:53,778
I'm sorry, madam.

251
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:55,012
What nonsense is this?

252
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,742
I'm Assistant Commissioner Nair,
from the crime branch.

253
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,288
Does that give you the
right to enter any girl's room?

254
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:03,028
Ma'am, I was chasing a thief,

255
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:04,526
who might have...
- What are you trying to say?

256
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,596
Do you think the thief
is hiding behind those curtains

257
00:31:06,686 --> 00:31:08,183
and I'm changing in his presence?

258
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:10,658
I want to meet your senior officer.

259
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:15,431
So you are his senior officer?

260
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:17,583
What kind of people
does your department recruit?

261
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:19,368
Your staff is so rude!

262
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:21,340
You are mistaken.

263
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:23,285
I am his subordinate.

264
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:25,986
So you work for such a person?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

265
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:28,278
Listen, ma'am,
we're only doing our duty. You...

266
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:30,201
Let me get dressed properly.

267
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,826
I'll protest against the injustice,
meted out to women by the police.

268
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:34,909
Please don't forget,

269
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,034
you get your salaries,
because we pay our taxes.

270
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,861
Ma'am,
why don't you try to understand?

271
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:41,909
I do understand everything.

272
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,076
Is it your job to protect women,
or to ogle at them lustily?

273
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:48,618
Am I staring at you lustily?

274
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:50,440
If you aren't,
then why are you standing here?

275
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:55,236
Why are we standing here?
- Sir, I...

276
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:56,206
Move.

277
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,640
You may come out now.

278
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:05,618
Thank you.

279
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:07,355
Face the wall.
- What?

280
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:10,458
I see, sorry.

281
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:11,889
Thanks.

282
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:14,783
Thank you.

283
00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:21,065
Who are you?

284
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:22,934
I'm nobody.

285
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,399
Why were the cops chasing you?

286
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:27,410
The police, where are they?

287
00:32:27,618 --> 00:32:30,740
I want to know the truth,
why were they chasing you?

288
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:36,072
I saved your life
and you are trying to fool me.

289
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:39,361
You keep out of this,
that will be better for you.

290
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,744
You need not worry about me.

291
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:44,451
Why were the police following you?

292
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:45,832
Because I was leading them.

293
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:48,233
We were playing hide and seek,
satisfied?

294
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:53,201
So you think, you're very smart?

295
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:56,182
I don't think so, I am.
- I see.

296
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:58,118
Yes,
I have been smart since childhood.

297
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:01,618
Have you been
a thief since childhood?

298
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,076
Do I look like a thief?

299
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:08,618
'Last night this man stole a black
box, from the customs warehouse.'

300
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:10,612
'The police and customs department
have confirmed,'

301
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:13,410
'that the box contains gold
worth Rs 20 million.'

302
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,660
20 million?

303
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,150
But that rascal said,
it was worth Rs 10 million.

304
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:18,801
You've robbed gold worth 20 million?

305
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,355
No, it's worth 10 million.

306
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:26,247
Now look here,
I know you've helped me a lot.

307
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:29,992
But I would've managed,
even without your help.

308
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:34,567
Don't think you are a Supergirl.

309
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,661
"Daud!"

310
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:43,867
"Daud! Daud! Daud!"

311
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:45,676
I wonder,
where that rascal has gone.

312
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,802
God, they won't spare me.

313
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:49,999
Pinki will devour me alive.

314
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:51,861
I made a grave mistake.

315
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:54,395
He has disappeared with box.

316
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,357
Has he run away with the booty?

317
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:58,595
I'll kill that rogue!

318
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:01,193
I'll kill him,
when I lay my hands on him.

319
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,783
So you lied to me?

320
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:08,861
How dare you cheat
an honest man like me?

321
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:11,801
I'll book you under section 420.

322
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:15,336
You said it was worth 10 million,
whereas it was worth 20 million.

323
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,878
I'll charge you for 40 million.

324
00:34:18,112 --> 00:34:20,488
Where's the box?
- Where's the money?

325
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:23,086
I want the box, first.
- I want the cash, first.

326
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:25,438
I said, give me the box.

327
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:27,453
I said, give me the money.

328
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:30,253
I don't have much time.

329
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,128
I don't have any money.

330
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:37,437
I'm warning you for the
last time, hand over the box to me.

331
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:38,669
I want my money.

332
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:41,539
We can keep arguing about this.

333
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:46,277
"Daud!"

334
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,170
It's tickling me.

335
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,086
I don't like such jokes.

336
00:34:53,562 --> 00:34:55,836
I'm scared of guns.

337
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,669
This is a bad joke.

338
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,718
Let's stop this
nonsense and talk seriously.

339
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:06,003
Let's talk business.

340
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,961
Don't you understand?

341
00:35:10,262 --> 00:35:11,895
Didn't I say, I dislike such jokes?

342
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:13,420
Move it, I say.

343
00:35:13,823 --> 00:35:15,643
What a strange man you are!

344
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,841
Tell me quickly or I'll...

345
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:33,211
Don't move.

346
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:36,230
This is a loaded gun and not a pen.

347
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:39,794
Come on, give me the gun.
I said, hurry up.

348
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:44,514
Sorry, I lied.

349
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,711
But don't move.

350
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:53,253
Okay, now walk. Nobody moves.

351
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,994
Come on, move.

352
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:59,413
But how did you get here?

353
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:02,220
This is no time to discuss this.
- But listen to me...

354
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,871
We must leave this place.
We can talk later.

355
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:04,746
Okay.
- Okay.

356
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:06,555
Take this.

357
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:10,846
Rascal, you tried to cheat me.

358
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:12,829
I'll teach you a lesson.

359
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,301
You also spoilt my new trousers.

360
00:36:16,414 --> 00:36:18,804
But how did you...
- Shut up and leave.

361
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,246
Come on, you fool.

362
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,298
Move.

363
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,128
One bullet in your head
and you'll know how it feels.

364
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:25,961
You cheated on me.

365
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:27,753
Now you'll know...

366
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,893
No! Don't kill him! Don't kill him!

367
00:36:41,347 --> 00:36:42,169
Hey!

368
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:30,338
Get them!

369
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:33,050
Ah! Huh!

370
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:11,571
First, tell me,
how did you reach here?

371
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:15,326
Look, that's you.
- I'm dead.

372
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,485
Let's run from this place, hurry up.

373
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:19,696
'WANTED'

374
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:23,362
Mr Nair, how can you
commit such a grave mistake?

375
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:24,690
The commissioner said that,

376
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,357
the thief had almost been
caught but managed to escape.

377
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,928
Sir, we tried
our best, but we failed.

378
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:34,488
Mr Nair, in this case even a minor
mistake could land us in trouble.

379
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,308
I think,
you should plan your moves.

380
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:39,896
By the way, meet Mr Rai. He works
for the intelligence agency.

381
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:41,513
He has been appointed
by the central government,

382
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,526
to investigate this case.

383
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:45,863
Hello.
- Hello.

384
00:38:46,488 --> 00:38:48,439
Dr Rai, it seems you feel,

385
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:52,084
that we are not dealing
with this case seriously,

386
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,155
which is not a fact.

387
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,821
Neither are we
going ahead without a plan.

388
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,478
This is a field job,
such things are common.

389
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:02,362
Nair,
nobody is doubting your dedication.

390
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,189
But please try to
understand the situation.

391
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:06,521
We are answerable to our seniors.
- I understand that, sir.

392
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,301
Look Mr Nair,
I trust you completely.

393
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,863
We have our hopes pinned on you,
but we want results.

394
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,613
Yes sir. I'll do my best.

395
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,974
Sir,

396
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:21,562
with due respect,
may I ask you a question?

397
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,974
Gold smuggling is very common.

398
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:30,946
But why is everyone so nervous
and tense about this case?

399
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,193
Is there any special reason?

400
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:41,609
Nair, this case is related
to an international racket.

401
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,657
That is all I can tell you,
at the moment.

402
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:46,155
Yes, sir.

403
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,231
You have to make a bill
for a higher amount.

404
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:51,314
What amount should I write?

405
00:39:51,404 --> 00:39:54,197
Increase it by twenty per cent
and you can keep five per cent.

406
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:55,835
All right.

407
00:40:03,308 --> 00:40:04,995
What a body?

408
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,734
Is it yours?

409
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,743
Madam, if my body is not mine,
then is it yours?

410
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:18,967
Modern vehicles are not so strong,

411
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:21,061
And neither do they look so sturdy?
- Huh?

412
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:22,357
Which model is this?

413
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:24,449
You are talking about the vehicle?

414
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,271
This is a 1980 model and I am sixty.

415
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:31,710
Will you please, give me a lift?

416
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:34,259
Why not? I can
leave the world if you say so.

417
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,090
How sweet!

418
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:38,986
Body?
- No.

419
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,111
Then who?

420
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,353
Your scarf. I love it.

421
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:48,743
By the way, where are you going?

422
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:50,284
Where do you want to go?

423
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:53,113
I want to go to Khandala.

424
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,236
I just remembered,
I am also going that way.

425
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:56,409
Is it?
- Yes.

426
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,110
Shall we?
- Please come.

427
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,152
"Come, sit in my car"

428
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:02,104
"Come, sit in my car"

429
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:04,076
"Come, sit in my car"

430
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,569
"Come, sit in my car"

431
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:09,427
Who are you?
Tell me, who are you?

432
00:41:09,993 --> 00:41:11,035
I asked you something?

433
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:12,478
Hello.
- Hello.

434
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,268
I've seen you somewhere.

435
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:26,899
Please try to understand!

436
00:41:27,035 --> 00:41:30,110
If we don't get that man,
Pinki will ruin our lives.

437
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,159
He will not tolerate all this.

438
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:35,373
Therefore go and look for him.
Get him, quick.

439
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,563
May I come in?

440
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:02,824
Pushkar,
how many times have I told you,

441
00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:05,121
I don't like the sound of gunshots?

442
00:42:05,265 --> 00:42:06,816
At least, affix a silencer.

443
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,253
He refuses to listen!

444
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:13,588
I was passing by. So, I thought
I will greet you. Hi.

445
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:15,149
Pinki, listen to me, Pinki.

446
00:42:15,456 --> 00:42:17,142
Pinki... Pinki, listen...

447
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,821
I want to tell you something, Pinki.
- Mr Khurana.

448
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:21,816
Mr Khurana.
- I want to tell you something, sir.

449
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,303
I want to tell you something, sir.
Sir, I...

450
00:42:23,393 --> 00:42:24,548
Sit here and talk.

451
00:42:24,638 --> 00:42:26,886
I want to tell you
the entire thing in detail, sir.

452
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:28,477
I... I...
- Here... Sit here.

453
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,710
I need to clarify something, sir.
We were about to do the job.

454
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,795
What happened?
- We were about to do the job.

455
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,896
I did my best.
- You did your best?

456
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,857
Please, believe me.
- I did not give you the job to try.

457
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:39,339
I asked you to complete the job.

458
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:40,301
Yes, yes, I was about to finish it.

459
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,260
That's why I tried.

460
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,196
We have been running around for
three years to get this job done.

461
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:44,835
Three years!
- Sir, I understand all this.

462
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:46,564
I understand all this but...
- Do not interrupt.

463
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:47,867
A girl...
- Do not interrupt.

464
00:42:47,957 --> 00:42:49,112
A girl came in the way, sir.

465
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:50,197
Where did a girl come
into the scene from?

466
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:51,992
None of us realised it. None of us.

467
00:42:52,082 --> 00:42:53,241
That girl came in our way,
all of a sudden, sir.

468
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:54,309
We were just about to
complete the task, sir.

469
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:55,751
He talks too much.

470
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,702
Sir, give me on chance, sir.
- How can I give you a chance?

471
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:58,440
How can I give you a chance?

472
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,360
Sir, I have never goofed up before.

473
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,955
First, we have been wandering
for three years!

474
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:03,189
Sir, I have never goofed up before.

475
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,089
Please, give me five to seven hours.

476
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,645
Please, give me five to seven hours.

477
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:10,049
Five to seven hours, indeed!

478
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:15,004
In our business,
there is no scope for,

479
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:18,204
blunder, error,
mistake, fault or slip!

480
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:21,031
Do you get it or not?
- Stop the drama, Pinki!

481
00:43:21,655 --> 00:43:22,703
He is dead.

482
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:24,879
Now, think about what to do next?

483
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:28,024
I'd warned you, that we
should do this job ourselves.

484
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:29,899
We shouldn't rely on outsiders.

485
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,732
But Pinki, just won't listen to me.

486
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:33,691
Didn't I warn you?

487
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:37,136
Stop this blame game,
forget about what has happened.

488
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:39,412
Try to think,
where can we find him?

489
00:43:39,502 --> 00:43:40,961
Where will you look for him?

490
00:43:41,253 --> 00:43:42,704
The police is
already looking for him.

491
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:45,211
We must get hold of him,
before the cops.

492
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:46,961
The police will catch him easily,

493
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:49,195
but where shall
we get information about him?

494
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:54,253
I got an idea.

495
00:43:58,544 --> 00:43:59,750
Who are you?

496
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:02,045
Why are you following me?

497
00:44:03,022 --> 00:44:03,958
Why don't you answer me?

498
00:44:04,048 --> 00:44:05,253
Why should I answer this question?

499
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:09,423
Have you told me who you are
and why the cops are chasing you?

500
00:44:10,003 --> 00:44:11,871
I didn't tell you because,

501
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:15,584
I didn't want a simple girl
like you, to land into trouble.

502
00:44:16,003 --> 00:44:17,902
Who told you I am a simple girl?

503
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:22,936
All right,
you are not a simple girl,

504
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:26,883
but tell me honestly,
why are you following me?

505
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,032
Fifty-fifty.

506
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:32,449
What?

507
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:35,037
Fifty-fifty.

508
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:38,627
Fifty-fifty?

509
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:43,024
Marriage?

510
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:48,093
Sorry.

511
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:50,683
Then why the hell
are you following me?

512
00:44:51,332 --> 00:44:53,817
Look,
the gold is worth Rs 20 million.

513
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:56,737
Give me half of it,
you can keep the rest.

514
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:01,711
We're dead.

515
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:03,566
Move the vehicle, quickly.

516
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:06,669
Hello, sir.
- You?

517
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,419
You're a girl.
- That's right,

518
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:10,550
I have never claimed to be a boy.

519
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:14,125
I mean, I've never
seen a girl driving a truck.

520
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:15,547
I don't believe it.

521
00:45:15,752 --> 00:45:21,038
If Basanti can ride a horse cart,
why can't I drive a truck?

522
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:23,094
Basanti? Who's she?

523
00:45:23,544 --> 00:45:24,919
The famous Basanti,
in the film Sholay.

524
00:45:25,044 --> 00:45:29,086
The one who lived in Ramgarh,
the macho man Veeru's girlfriend.

525
00:45:29,295 --> 00:45:31,485
Veeru's girlfriend? Who is Veeru?

526
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:37,128
The same Veeru, who was
summoned by Thakur to kill Gabbar.

527
00:45:37,295 --> 00:45:39,169
Shut up, silly girl.

528
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:42,938
Is this your truck?
- Yes, it's mine.

529
00:45:43,253 --> 00:45:46,079
My father gifted it to me,
on my birthday.

530
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:48,812
He gifted my mother a tempo,
she drives a tempo.

531
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:50,794
Then what does your father do?

532
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:53,329
He looks after the house.

533
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:56,003
The whole family
is very influential!

534
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,003
Let me check it out.
- What are you looking for?

535
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:01,499
What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

536
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:17,419
"Daud! Daud!"

537
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:22,641
"We run here!
We run there! This life is a race!"

538
00:46:22,731 --> 00:46:26,547
"One runs, and the others chase...
Life is a race!"

539
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:29,277
"Some run after money..."

540
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,105
"Others chase their love..."

541
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,783
"Hey, some run after money..."

542
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:38,922
"Others chase their love..."

543
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:40,549
"Daud! Daud!"

544
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,656
"Daud! Daud!"

545
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,715
"Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!"

546
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:48,488
"We run here!
We run there! This life is a race!"

547
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:54,539
"One runs, and the others chase...
Life is a race!"

548
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:46,520
"This world is crazy!"

549
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:50,297
"What sort of restlessness is this?"

550
00:47:51,498 --> 00:47:54,958
"This world is crazy! What sort of
restlessness is this?"

551
00:47:55,048 --> 00:47:58,521
"Everyone is after something
or the other..."

552
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:02,027
"Just as an ant's heart
yearns for sugar!"

553
00:48:02,117 --> 00:48:05,337
"Life is a race! Daud! Daud!"

554
00:48:08,034 --> 00:48:09,602
"Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!"

555
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:13,342
"We run here!
We run there! This life is a race!"

556
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:17,240
"One runs, and the others chase...
Life is a race!"

557
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,180
"Some run after money..."

558
00:48:20,491 --> 00:48:23,722
"Others chase their love..."

559
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:28,095
"Some run after money..."

560
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:31,349
"Daud! Daud!"

561
00:48:31,548 --> 00:48:35,547
"Daud! Daud!"

562
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:00,608
"Hey, everything is upside down!"

563
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:04,079
"Oh, dear! There is complete chaos!"

564
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:08,715
"Hey, everything is upside down!
Oh, dear! There is complete chaos!"

565
00:49:08,805 --> 00:49:12,144
"One must fight to survive."

566
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:15,963
"But who wants to die?"

567
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,224
"Hey Daud! Hey, daud!"

568
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:21,500
"Daud!"

569
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,403
"Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!"

570
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,078
"We run here!
We run there! This life is a race!"

571
00:49:27,222 --> 00:49:30,999
"One runs, and the others chase...
Life is a race!"

572
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:34,182
"Some run after money..."

573
00:49:34,777 --> 00:49:37,933
"Others chase their love..."

574
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:41,878
"Some run after money...
Others chase their love..."

575
00:49:41,968 --> 00:49:45,204
"Daud! Daud!"

576
00:49:45,294 --> 00:49:49,483
"Daud! Daud!"

577
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:15,649
"Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!"

578
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:20,841
Puja, where are you?
- I'm here.

579
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:23,488
I'm getting late.
- Come, my child.

580
00:50:23,578 --> 00:50:25,349
I'll come back late, don't worry.

581
00:50:25,514 --> 00:50:26,500
All right.

582
00:50:39,765 --> 00:50:41,295
Who is it?
- Postman.

583
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:42,355
Postman.
- Huh!

584
00:50:43,105 --> 00:50:45,343
Have a chocolate. Won't you
eat a chocolate?

585
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:46,765
Yeah? You won't eat?

586
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,149
Ah!

587
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:56,180
Look, when I was a child like you,

588
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:59,894
I would yearn for chocolates.

589
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:01,796
But my mother would lie to me.

590
00:51:01,886 --> 00:51:04,724
She said that if I eat chocolates,
I would fall sick.

591
00:51:04,814 --> 00:51:06,938
And the teeth... They will fall off!

592
00:51:07,886 --> 00:51:09,122
And I would cry.

593
00:51:09,836 --> 00:51:11,258
I would cry all day.

594
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:13,929
One day, my mother died.

595
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:15,970
My mother died.

596
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,286
And then... I could have had as many
chocolates, as I felt like.

597
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:21,660
But, by then I was an adult.

598
00:51:22,188 --> 00:51:24,276
I wouldn't feel like
eating chocolates.

599
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:27,552
That is why I say, eat the
chocolate if you feel like it.

600
00:51:28,128 --> 00:51:29,250
Have the chocolate.

601
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,360
Oh, Oh, oh, oh? You will eat it
if your mother gives it to you?

602
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:35,718
You want your
mother, to feed you chocolate?

603
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:37,464
Hi, mom!

604
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,314
Hey, mom.

605
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:48,648
Please feed your son some chocolate.

606
00:51:49,027 --> 00:51:50,569
Ooh! La! La! La!

607
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:52,891
What a fair hand!

608
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:56,611
And these green
bangles on your fair hand...

609
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,941
If a little blood oozes out,
it will form a lovely 'rangoli.'

610
00:52:00,121 --> 00:52:02,887
Red, green and white.
- Let go of my wife's hand.

611
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:05,515
So, what should I hold?
Hey, forgive me.

612
00:52:05,725 --> 00:52:08,185
It is a sin to touch
another man's wife.

613
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,531
However sexy, sister-in-law is, I
mustn't look. What say, son?

614
00:52:15,105 --> 00:52:17,559
You probably hate this talk?

615
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,087
What say, sister-in-law, Suvarna?
- Come to the point.

616
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:21,799
Sister-in-law,
sister-in-law, sister-in-law.

617
00:52:22,003 --> 00:52:26,311
Hey! Talk some sense
into your husband.

618
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:29,119
What do you want? Tell me, clearly!

619
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:32,801
Information... About a thief.

620
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,556
As soon as the police get a clue
about the thief,

621
00:52:35,646 --> 00:52:37,889
you must get in touch
with me, immediately.

622
00:52:38,143 --> 00:52:40,956
And, please tell us
the whereabouts of the thief.

623
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:46,014
Otherwise, your entire family will
sleep in the cemetery.

624
00:52:46,218 --> 00:52:49,140
By order. Understand?

625
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,337
I cannot betray. I am not a traitor.

626
00:52:52,427 --> 00:52:54,059
Yes, but you are a father?

627
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:58,331
Or do you want me to cut your
innocent son's lips,

628
00:52:58,493 --> 00:52:59,993
and increase his
jaw opening by two inches?

629
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:02,507
So, that he keeps
smiling for the rest of his life.

630
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:05,219
And can work as a model for
a toothpaste ad?

631
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,054
A fiery son of an honest father!

632
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:11,660
Uses Colgate every day!

633
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,074
Stop it, now.
This is no child's play.

634
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:16,978
Everyman is under scrutiny
in our department.

635
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,187
And, how will I give
you the information?

636
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:22,721
If you want your son to live,
you will have to do all this.

637
00:53:23,628 --> 00:53:27,329
Otherwise, this scoundrel will
smile with his injured lips for life

638
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:30,866
and you will look at him and
cry all your life. Got it?

639
00:53:31,094 --> 00:53:32,900
Son, ask your father,

640
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:35,192
not to be so stubborn.

641
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:37,046
Papa, you mustn't be so stubborn.

642
00:53:37,226 --> 00:53:40,298
Papa, you mustn't be so stubborn.
- Yes, yes, yes.

643
00:53:40,388 --> 00:53:44,404
Will you do it? Son, day 'Jai Hind!'
to your father.

644
00:53:44,906 --> 00:53:46,623
'Jai Hind!'
- Say it louder.

645
00:53:46,713 --> 00:53:48,476
'Jai Hind!'
- Say it louder.

646
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:49,893
'Jai Hind!'

647
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:51,981
What are you saying?
They got away again.

648
00:53:52,071 --> 00:53:53,851
I'm sorry sir,
it was our mistake.

649
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:55,578
How many more
mistakes will you make?

650
00:53:55,668 --> 00:53:56,582
Even the last time he...

651
00:53:56,672 --> 00:53:59,644
Sir, inspector Rana was to blame,
he let the girl go.

652
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:01,870
A girl? Who was she?

653
00:54:02,524 --> 00:54:03,883
Her name is Basanti.

654
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,605
What is the date today?

655
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,705
Twenty-fifth.
- Hmm.

656
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:10,575
Another five days
before we receive the salary.

657
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:12,942
What do you think? Will we
get a hike this time?

658
00:54:13,658 --> 00:54:16,712
Not just salary, we should get
a twenty-five per cent bonus. - Hmm.

659
00:54:16,802 --> 00:54:18,506
Otherwise, we will grow old
like this one day.

660
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:20,966
There is no news of the increase
in DA either.

661
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:22,958
Is it?
- Huh, sir.

662
00:54:23,384 --> 00:54:25,988
So, my constable
needs a salary hike?

663
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:28,916
And you also want
a twenty-five per cent bonus?

664
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:32,721
Hey, we should deduct your salary.
And that too by fifty per cent.

665
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:34,664
You have done such a brave act!

666
00:54:34,754 --> 00:54:37,846
A girl fooled you! Idiots!

667
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,000
They call themselves
policemen! Policemen!

668
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:44,188
Hey, they wear the uniform
and claim to protect the people!

669
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:47,457
Do you know why he was miffed?

670
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:50,523
The same girl had him fooled too.

671
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:52,225
What?
- Yes.

672
00:55:11,627 --> 00:55:12,645
Hey!

673
00:55:16,701 --> 00:55:19,638
Look around and see if you
can find water to drink.

674
00:55:20,677 --> 00:55:23,140
My father's five star
hotel is in the vicinity,

675
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,793
you can have a cold drink there.

676
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:28,541
You think you're very smart,
don't you?

677
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:29,629
There's no doubt about it.

678
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:31,021
God!

679
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:33,395
Now what?
- A thorn...

680
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:35,876
Why do you walk
with your head in the clouds?

681
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:37,302
Look at the ground
you're walking on.

682
00:55:37,594 --> 00:55:39,546
Did you expect to find
a carpet, in the jungle?

683
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:42,012
Shut up.
You're behind all this.

684
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,802
Am I to blame? What do you mean?

685
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,629
I told you repeatedly,
let drive the truck.

686
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:47,629
But you kept
pulling at the steering.

687
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,295
Both of us would've died
if I hadn't done so. - Come off it.

688
00:55:49,385 --> 00:55:51,463
Are you going to
teach me how to drive? Idiot!

689
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:55,069
Don't speak to me like that?

690
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:56,532
Don't try to scare me!

691
00:56:02,594 --> 00:56:05,014
If you had been a boy,
I would've taught you a lesson.

692
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:07,506
She thinks no end of herself.

693
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,581
Hey!

694
00:56:16,886 --> 00:56:18,087
What would you do?

695
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:19,557
Tell me,
what will you do? Answer me.

696
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:21,712
Don't speak to me like that.
- What will you do?

697
00:56:21,802 --> 00:56:22,864
Come on, show me.

698
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:25,052
Come on, show me.

699
00:56:30,677 --> 00:56:31,999
What will you do?

700
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,385
Let me go!

701
00:57:31,177 --> 00:57:35,397
A girl's place is in the kitchen.
She shouldn't quarrel with men.

702
00:57:35,594 --> 00:57:39,228
Therefore I advise you,
stop trying to be a man.

703
00:57:42,969 --> 00:57:43,874
You bit me?

704
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:19,968
Sorry.

705
00:58:23,544 --> 00:58:24,583
I said, I'm sorry.

706
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:27,402
Don't touch me.

707
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:29,931
Look, I'm really sorry.

708
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:32,595
I just got carried away.

709
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:35,766
Anyway,

710
00:58:36,444 --> 00:58:39,958
Both of us are in trouble.

711
00:58:40,705 --> 00:58:43,402
Let's find a way to
get out of this mess.

712
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:45,708
Okay?
- Yes.

713
00:58:48,498 --> 00:58:49,535
What's your name?

714
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,973
Tell me your name.

715
00:58:56,206 --> 00:58:57,908
Daya Shankar.
- What?

716
00:58:59,026 --> 00:59:00,197
Daya Shankar.

717
00:59:00,758 --> 00:59:01,743
Daya Shankar?

718
00:59:03,197 --> 00:59:04,123
Why?

719
00:59:04,623 --> 00:59:05,791
It's a beautiful name.

720
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,796
What's yours?

721
00:59:09,026 --> 00:59:10,668
Uma Parvati.
- What?

722
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:12,948
Uma Parvati.

723
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,093
Nice meeting you.

724
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:27,584
I hope you remember
our fifty-fifty deal?

725
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:31,089
Yes, I do.

726
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:44,818
Basanti?

727
00:59:46,135 --> 00:59:47,958
Who is she?
- Sir,

728
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:54,981
Mr Nair says inspector Rana met
that girl, at the check post.

729
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,840
She mentioned 'Sholay' to him.
- Sholay?

730
00:59:58,032 --> 01:00:00,211
Who is Sholay?
- Haven't you heard of 'Sholay'?

731
01:00:00,301 --> 01:00:01,916
No, I have never met him.

732
01:00:02,006 --> 01:00:04,146
Dr Rai,
Sholay is the name of a film.

733
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:05,582
It was
one of the greatest hits in India.

734
01:00:05,672 --> 01:00:07,379
I'm sorry,
but I'm not much of a movie buff.

735
01:00:08,064 --> 01:00:09,779
How is 'Sholay'
related to this case?

736
01:00:10,115 --> 01:00:11,634
Sir, we have to find that out.

737
01:00:36,739 --> 01:00:37,963
What are you staring at?

738
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:39,447
What?

739
01:00:40,773 --> 01:00:42,472
What are you looking at?

740
01:00:43,213 --> 01:00:44,240
Nothing.

741
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:46,156
That's a lie.

742
01:00:46,787 --> 01:00:47,614
What?

743
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,342
Don't feign innocence.

744
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:50,956
You were staring at me.

745
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,363
I was staring at you?
- Yes, you were staring at me.

746
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:57,108
All right, I was staring at you.
- You shouldn't look at me.

747
01:00:57,198 --> 01:00:58,357
I shouldn't look at you?
- That's right.

748
01:00:58,447 --> 01:00:59,462
Why can't I?

749
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,705
Do you own this forest?

750
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:05,404
If I can stare at nature
and all that's around us,

751
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:06,614
why can't I look at you?

752
01:01:06,808 --> 01:01:07,934
Tell me one thing,

753
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:10,379
does this disease run
in your family?

754
01:01:11,323 --> 01:01:14,616
You keep fighting and...
- Don't talk about my family.

755
01:01:14,823 --> 01:01:16,573
Quarrelsome cat!

756
01:01:20,656 --> 01:01:21,704
Daya Shankar,

757
01:01:23,115 --> 01:01:24,698
tell me something about your family?

758
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:26,854
I don't have a family.

759
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:30,005
Are you alone?

760
01:01:33,642 --> 01:01:34,790
I have a boyfriend.

761
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,073
Boyfriend?

762
01:01:39,748 --> 01:01:41,122
He's very handsome.

763
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:45,782
He looks like a Greek god.
- Great!

764
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,095
Do you have a girlfriend?

765
01:01:51,614 --> 01:01:52,525
What?

766
01:01:53,226 --> 01:01:55,531
I asked, do you have a girlfriend?

767
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:57,036
No.

768
01:01:58,156 --> 01:01:59,087
Why?

769
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:03,559
I didn't like anyone so far.

770
01:02:09,363 --> 01:02:10,531
Daya Shankar.

771
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,605
Do you really have a boyfriend?

772
01:02:16,282 --> 01:02:18,150
Is it true that you
don't have a girlfriend?

773
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,331
I asked you first.

774
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,906
Maybe.

775
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,607
But I'm asking you now.

776
01:02:30,323 --> 01:02:31,276
Tell me.

777
01:02:33,073 --> 01:02:35,750
You see, er...
- Come on, tell me.

778
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:38,381
Why do you wish to know?
- Simply.

779
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:40,146
All right, then I needn't tell.

780
01:02:40,698 --> 01:02:43,352
I won't answer your question too.
- As you wish.

781
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:01,218
Daya Shankar!

782
01:03:58,094 --> 01:04:03,340
"Poisonous love..."

783
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:09,346
"I'll sting you..."

784
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:15,977
"My poisonous tongue
is ready to strike."

785
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:21,950
"I have turned into
a snake from a woman."

786
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:27,629
"Poisonous love..."

787
01:04:28,263 --> 01:04:33,071
"I'll sting you..."

788
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:40,109
"My poisonous tongue
is ready to strike."

789
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:46,124
"I have turned into
a snake from a woman."

790
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:34,188
"I languish on
the branches of trees..."

791
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:40,160
"You are my prey. I am on
the lookout for you."

792
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:46,220
"I can feel your
presence when I am alone."

793
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:52,263
"Your perfume excites me."

794
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:58,290
"Control me or else,"

795
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:04,267
"who knows what will happen?"

796
01:06:31,632 --> 01:06:36,916
"This poisonous love
is intoxicating."

797
01:06:37,637 --> 01:06:42,786
"This restlessness that will
neither let you live nor die..."

798
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:49,631
"In your eyes..."

799
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:55,693
"I can drink
this poison from your eyes."

800
01:06:55,783 --> 01:07:01,702
"Come and look into my eyes!"

801
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:07,671
"Let your lips meet mine..."

802
01:07:07,761 --> 01:07:13,477
"Poisonous love..."

803
01:07:13,868 --> 01:07:19,549
"I'll sting you..."

804
01:07:19,804 --> 01:07:25,824
"I won't let you sleep..."

805
01:07:25,914 --> 01:07:31,500
"I'll embrace you with my arms..."

806
01:07:31,933 --> 01:07:36,527
"Poisonous love..."

807
01:07:37,955 --> 01:07:42,854
"I'll sting you..."

808
01:07:43,973 --> 01:07:49,593
"My poisonous tongue
is ready to strike."

809
01:07:49,911 --> 01:07:55,691
"I have turned into
a snake from a woman."

810
01:08:17,429 --> 01:08:18,412
Daya Shankar!

811
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:21,687
Daya Shankar!

812
01:08:24,592 --> 01:08:26,155
Daya Shankar!

813
01:09:45,778 --> 01:09:46,796
What?

814
01:10:03,085 --> 01:10:04,195
What was that?

815
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:08,672
Why don't you answer me?
What's wrong?

816
01:10:08,977 --> 01:10:11,548
I saw a helicopter.
- Helicopter?

817
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,119
What helicopter?
- The police helicopter.

818
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,087
Where is it?
- It was here looking for us.

819
01:10:31,839 --> 01:10:36,089
I saw it in the nick of time,
or else we would've been in trouble.

820
01:10:36,464 --> 01:10:38,548
Do you think I'm a fool?

821
01:10:39,089 --> 01:10:41,422
What?
- Don't pretend.

822
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,629
I know all your tricks.

823
01:10:43,797 --> 01:10:48,467
I've noticed that you always,
try to touch me under some pretext.

824
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:50,771
I try to touch you?

825
01:10:51,256 --> 01:10:54,458
Have you lost your mind completely?
- No, you have gone mad!

826
01:10:54,548 --> 01:10:57,767
All you can think of is filth!

827
01:10:58,131 --> 01:10:59,089
Filth?

828
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,986
I know everything.

829
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,814
You keep following me all the time.

830
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:07,422
Am I the one following you?
You were the one who chased me.

831
01:11:08,589 --> 01:11:11,880
I was not chasing you,
I was interested in gold.

832
01:11:12,005 --> 01:11:14,582
But if I have to
put up with a man like you,

833
01:11:14,672 --> 01:11:16,851
I don't want that gold.
It's goodbye from me.

834
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:18,180
Get lost.

835
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:20,374
Good bye.
- I'm leaving,

836
01:11:20,464 --> 01:11:22,332
don't try to talk to me. - Just go.
Why are you yapping away?

837
01:11:22,422 --> 01:11:23,656
I'm not talking to you.

838
01:11:23,797 --> 01:11:25,124
I'm not leaving
because you asked me to.

839
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,166
Who wants to talk to you?
- Shut up,

840
01:11:27,256 --> 01:11:29,665
Don't talk too much, get lost.
- I'm not leaving because of you.

841
01:11:29,755 --> 01:11:30,589
Go.

842
01:11:30,728 --> 01:11:32,832
I wonder what he thinks of himself?
- Daya Shankar!

843
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:36,030
I shouldn't have come with you.

844
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:39,797
He thinks I have no brains.
Show off. - Get lost,

845
01:11:40,256 --> 01:11:41,730
what does she think of herself?

846
01:12:51,713 --> 01:12:55,285
I won't spare you.
What do you think of yourself?

847
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,522
Look I said sorry.

848
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:02,088
Don't run, wait till I get you.

849
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:31,872
I want to say something.
- What?

850
01:13:32,672 --> 01:13:34,316
My name is not Daya Shankar.

851
01:13:40,839 --> 01:13:42,712
I'm not Uma Parvati either.

852
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:44,676
You're not?
- No.

853
01:13:46,273 --> 01:13:47,318
Bhawani.

854
01:13:48,464 --> 01:13:49,528
Nandu.

855
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:50,948
Nice meeting you.

856
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:01,172
Is there a hotel nearby?
- Chako.

857
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:03,672
Chako?
- Chako?

858
01:15:05,326 --> 01:15:07,297
A hotel?
- Chako.

859
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:12,526
Not Chako, but a hotel?
We want to eat... - It's all right.

860
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:15,569
So Chako?
- Chako.

861
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,114
Okay.

862
01:15:18,345 --> 01:15:19,281
Chako.

863
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:25,612
Uncle, is there a hotel nearby?

864
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:27,214
Chako.
- Chako?

865
01:15:27,865 --> 01:15:29,589
Where's the hotel?
- Chako.

866
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:33,385
Uncle, we're talking
about a restaurant. - Chako.

867
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,755
What is Chako?

868
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:43,442
Chako.
- Chako.

869
01:15:55,755 --> 01:15:58,089
Fatso, where's Chako hotel?

870
01:16:01,922 --> 01:16:03,922
I asked you about Chako?

871
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:06,216
That's my name.

872
01:16:06,505 --> 01:16:08,422
I want two rooms in your hotel.

873
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:12,839
I said that was my name,
it is not a hotel.

874
01:16:13,184 --> 01:16:14,256
Get lost.

875
01:16:18,683 --> 01:16:22,816
I'm sorry, everyone in
the village kept saying Chako,

876
01:16:23,213 --> 01:16:25,005
so I thought you own a hotel.

877
01:16:25,506 --> 01:16:26,589
I said, leave.

878
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:31,381
Mr Chako.

879
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:34,432
We've come a long way.

880
01:16:42,172 --> 01:16:43,401
Please be seated.

881
01:16:43,713 --> 01:16:45,487
Please be seated.

882
01:16:45,629 --> 01:16:47,131
Here?
- Yes.

883
01:16:47,361 --> 01:16:48,880
Thank you.
- Please!

884
01:16:58,589 --> 01:17:00,904
What can I do for you?

885
01:17:01,348 --> 01:17:05,302
You see,
we've come a long way away.

886
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:07,548
We're extremely tired.

887
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:10,852
If you could arrange for a
place for us to live in...

888
01:17:10,942 --> 01:17:13,256
Do you want a village?
I can give you one.

889
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:18,509
If you want the mountain, take it.
Or take the fields, if you want to.

890
01:17:18,832 --> 01:17:19,932
Do you want the forest?

891
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,089
We don't want the forest.

892
01:17:22,802 --> 01:17:24,499
I have not given it away as yet.

893
01:17:24,589 --> 01:17:27,589
You see Mr Chako,
we have come from the jungle.

894
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:29,646
That is why,
I didn't give it to you.

895
01:17:29,736 --> 01:17:31,172
Mr Chako.
- Yes.

896
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:35,696
If you could arrange for a hotel...

897
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:39,560
There are no hotels
in this village. - Really?

898
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:41,672
But don't worry.

899
01:17:42,318 --> 01:17:44,508
My name is Chako, I'll help you.

900
01:17:45,108 --> 01:17:48,005
Do you know why I'm called Chako?
- Do tell me?

901
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:54,028
When I was a kid,
I killed a tiger with a knife.

902
01:17:54,616 --> 01:17:55,543
Did you hear that?

903
01:17:55,682 --> 01:17:58,752
Ever since people have
called me Chako. - That's great!

904
01:17:59,856 --> 01:18:04,089
As long as I'm with you,
you needn't feel scared.

905
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:09,434
I'll fulfil all your requirements.

906
01:18:10,116 --> 01:18:13,056
I'm willing
to do everything for you.

907
01:18:18,213 --> 01:18:19,101
Sorry.

908
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:21,005
Greetings!

909
01:18:22,105 --> 01:18:22,989
Everything in this village,

910
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:26,755
including the trees
and pebbles are mine.

911
01:18:28,108 --> 01:18:30,754
All the villagers are my children.

912
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,424
Your children?

913
01:18:34,054 --> 01:18:35,824
I mean, they're like my children.

914
01:18:36,094 --> 01:18:37,257
I see.

915
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:44,926
I've been ruling this village,
for the last four hundred years.

916
01:18:45,265 --> 01:18:48,467
Last four hundred years?
- Yes, that's right!

917
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:51,029
But you don't look that old?

918
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:55,010
I meant, my ancestors have

919
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:00,253
ruled this village
for the last 400 years.

920
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:02,674
I'm young.

921
01:19:04,543 --> 01:19:05,572
What brings you here?

922
01:19:05,837 --> 01:19:07,001
Chennai.
- Delhi.

923
01:19:08,033 --> 01:19:09,299
Chennai
- Delhi.

924
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:14,381
You see, I'm from Delhi
and she's from Chennai.

925
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:16,739
I'm from Chennai.. - You're
from Delhi and she's from Chennai.

926
01:19:16,913 --> 01:19:19,289
I've come from Chennai
and he's from Delhi.

927
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:21,881
You're from Chennai
and he is from Delhi? - No,

928
01:19:22,497 --> 01:19:24,220
I'm from Delhi
and she's from Chennai.

929
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:25,840
Never mind!

930
01:19:26,602 --> 01:19:28,186
But why have you come here?

931
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,800
Why?

932
01:19:30,094 --> 01:19:31,257
I want to know.

933
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:35,436
Because her
father is a great hunter.

934
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:38,837
My father too was a great hunter.

935
01:19:39,017 --> 01:19:40,132
What was your mother's profession?

936
01:19:40,271 --> 01:19:41,921
My mother?
- Yes, your mother?

937
01:19:42,101 --> 01:19:46,466
My mother was not a hunter.
- Neither was mine.

938
01:19:46,556 --> 01:19:48,891
You see mothers
shouldn't be hunting,

939
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,049
it has a
bad effect on the children.

940
01:19:51,139 --> 01:19:53,119
But my mother was a hunter.

941
01:19:53,883 --> 01:19:55,257
A great hunter!

942
01:19:57,045 --> 01:19:58,029
Why?

943
01:19:58,773 --> 01:19:59,674
Why?

944
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:02,007
What do you mean?
- Why?

945
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,257
You mean, why was she a hunter?

946
01:20:04,653 --> 01:20:06,591
Why have you come here?

947
01:20:07,421 --> 01:20:08,640
Why did we come here?

948
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:12,920
Because her father
is a great hunter.

949
01:20:13,586 --> 01:20:14,702
And...

950
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:17,391
Why don't you tell him,
Daya Shankar? - Daya Shankar?

951
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:20,483
Who is Daya Shankar?
- That's my name.

952
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:22,373
Daya Shankar?

953
01:20:23,663 --> 01:20:24,881
Why not?

954
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:28,967
It's a lovely name, Daya Shankar.

955
01:20:29,267 --> 01:20:32,285
My name is Chako. Nice to meet you.

956
01:20:32,711 --> 01:20:34,439
I'm Uma Parvati.

957
01:20:34,715 --> 01:20:36,269
Nice to meet you.

958
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:39,989
But why have you come here?

959
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:41,965
Why are we here?

960
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:46,013
Because her
father is a great hunter.

961
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:48,827
I already know that. What next?

962
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:53,713
Well, her father is who is a
great hunter... - I know that.

963
01:20:53,803 --> 01:20:56,335
He came to this forest
while chasing a tiger.

964
01:20:56,713 --> 01:20:57,602
This forest?
- Yes.

965
01:20:57,692 --> 01:20:58,674
Then?

966
01:20:59,091 --> 01:21:00,846
The tiger ran ahead
while her father followed.

967
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:03,758
The tiger led while
her father followed. - No.

968
01:21:04,928 --> 01:21:06,854
Her father was behind the tiger.

969
01:21:08,276 --> 01:21:11,091
Her father was behind the tiger
and the tiger was leading.

970
01:21:11,181 --> 01:21:12,710
You don't get it, Mr Chako.

971
01:21:13,376 --> 01:21:16,166
The tiger led,
while her father followed.

972
01:21:16,514 --> 01:21:17,564
The tiger led
while her father followed.

973
01:21:17,654 --> 01:21:20,838
First tell me, who was hunting?
The tiger or her father?

974
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:23,658
My mother.
- Mother?

975
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,368
Where did she come from?

976
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:28,466
Answer him Daya Shankar.
- I...

977
01:21:28,556 --> 01:21:30,957
Mr Chako, actually...
- Yes.

978
01:21:31,856 --> 01:21:35,383
My father is a great...
- He is a great hunter.

979
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:38,863
I know that well.
My father was also a great hunter.

980
01:21:38,953 --> 01:21:41,275
And my mother
too was a great hunter.

981
01:21:41,365 --> 01:21:43,777
I said, I know that.
What happened after that?

982
01:21:43,867 --> 01:21:48,174
My father followed the tiger,
right into the dense forest.

983
01:21:48,427 --> 01:21:52,675
I see.
- His mother went to look for him.

984
01:21:52,957 --> 01:21:55,861
Come on, you tell the rest.
- Me?

985
01:21:56,827 --> 01:21:58,080
What happened next?

986
01:21:58,325 --> 01:22:00,834
Well, her father who is a...

987
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:03,881
He is a great hunter, I know that.

988
01:22:03,971 --> 01:22:05,214
What happened after that?

989
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:06,881
Then,

990
01:22:07,783 --> 01:22:10,091
her father who is a... - He is a
great hunter, I do know that.

991
01:22:10,181 --> 01:22:13,194
What next? - He entered this
forest while chasing a tiger.

992
01:22:13,806 --> 01:22:16,644
The tiger... - The tiger
led while her father followed...

993
01:22:16,734 --> 01:22:17,682
What happened next?

994
01:22:18,504 --> 01:22:20,879
The tiger led
while her father followed...

995
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:24,007
The father followed while
the tiger led. Then?

996
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:25,583
Look, you don't understand.

997
01:22:26,086 --> 01:22:28,856
Father was behind the tiger,
- Ahead?

998
01:22:29,095 --> 01:22:30,329
Behind.
- Ahead?

999
01:22:30,419 --> 01:22:33,180
No, behind.
- I mean what happened ahead?

1000
01:22:33,852 --> 01:22:35,299
All right.

1001
01:22:35,508 --> 01:22:36,633
Well,

1002
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:40,001
her father who was a...
- He was a great hunter!

1003
01:22:40,091 --> 01:22:42,594
I have understood that.
What happened next?

1004
01:22:42,906 --> 01:22:45,438
He entered this forest
while chasing a tiger.

1005
01:22:45,942 --> 01:22:48,388
The tiger went ahead
and her father followed,

1006
01:22:48,478 --> 01:22:53,122
father was being led by the tiger
but what happened after that?

1007
01:22:53,578 --> 01:22:56,842
My mother who was a...

1008
01:22:56,932 --> 01:23:00,220
She is a great hunter, I know that.

1009
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,782
She was following them,
but what happened next?

1010
01:23:03,862 --> 01:23:08,542
My mother who is a great hunter,
walked behind her father.

1011
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:11,831
The tiger led, her father followed
the tiger and my mom followed him.

1012
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:13,301
The tiger was behind my mother

1013
01:23:13,603 --> 01:23:15,475
and her father was behind the tiger.

1014
01:23:17,549 --> 01:23:19,132
The tiger led,

1015
01:23:19,514 --> 01:23:21,209
while her father followed.

1016
01:23:21,299 --> 01:23:25,620
He was a great hunter, yes he was.
Then behind them was your mother,

1017
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:28,778
she too was a great hunter,
very great!

1018
01:23:28,975 --> 01:23:31,528
But how did the
tiger get behind them?

1019
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:35,425
Wasn't the tiger leading,
how did he get behind your mother?

1020
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:37,300
Do you think I'm a fool?

1021
01:23:38,176 --> 01:23:42,262
You see, they were
running around in circles.

1022
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,716
In a circle?
- Yes.

1023
01:23:45,806 --> 01:23:46,924
I get it now.

1024
01:23:47,309 --> 01:23:51,299
Both of you followed them
and lost your way.

1025
01:23:51,389 --> 01:23:55,751
That's brilliant, Chako!
You're great!

1026
01:23:55,841 --> 01:23:59,584
You're too great! You're a genius.
- Chako!

1027
01:23:59,674 --> 01:24:03,216
Please come in.
This is my humble palace.

1028
01:24:03,508 --> 01:24:04,549
This?

1029
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:06,127
Yes, this is it!

1030
01:24:06,502 --> 01:24:08,549
It's beautiful!
- Thank you.

1031
01:24:08,776 --> 01:24:11,924
We have everything,
nothing is lacking.

1032
01:24:12,132 --> 01:24:13,466
Just...

1033
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,200
I need someone by my side.

1034
01:24:19,902 --> 01:24:21,758
Please come, this way.

1035
01:24:22,053 --> 01:24:25,191
My grandfather took forty years,
to get this palace built.

1036
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:28,233
He had to cut down
four hundred trees.

1037
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:34,219
I don't want anyone's help.

1038
01:24:42,765 --> 01:24:44,249
I'm perfectly okay.

1039
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:46,508
I'm all right.

1040
01:24:46,598 --> 01:24:50,800
Mr Chako, we've been roaming around
the forest, for the last 2 days.

1041
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:54,216
Could you arrange for us
to have a bath? - Yes, of course.

1042
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:57,616
But Uma Parvati, we don't
have clothes to change into.

1043
01:24:59,924 --> 01:25:03,202
Mr Chako, can we get some clothes?

1044
01:25:05,611 --> 01:25:07,015
Yes, I'll arrange for them.

1045
01:25:23,056 --> 01:25:24,049
Nandu,

1046
01:25:25,026 --> 01:25:27,654
you look fabulous in this attire.

1047
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:30,996
You are also
looking very beautiful.

1048
01:25:35,081 --> 01:25:36,287
Hey.
- Hey!

1049
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,730
Who is this joker?

1050
01:25:38,924 --> 01:25:41,219
Speak softly, Chako might hear you.

1051
01:25:41,516 --> 01:25:43,159
Chako doesn't wear a moustache.

1052
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:45,132
This is my grandfather.

1053
01:25:45,257 --> 01:25:47,174
My great grandfather.

1054
01:25:47,264 --> 01:25:48,591
He was a great man!

1055
01:25:48,681 --> 01:25:52,424
His was so great that he
remained a bachelor all his life.

1056
01:25:54,049 --> 01:25:56,330
He didn't get married?
- Never!

1057
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:59,657
He remained unmarried all his life.

1058
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:01,299
What a man!

1059
01:26:07,049 --> 01:26:10,531
And this is my hunter,
who was a very great father!

1060
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:13,765
He too was very great!
I really adore his greatness.

1061
01:26:14,959 --> 01:26:16,837
I guess, he too was unmarried.

1062
01:26:18,216 --> 01:26:22,239
How would I be here today,
if he hadn't married?

1063
01:26:23,633 --> 01:26:26,558
Mr Chako,
what about your mother?

1064
01:26:27,151 --> 01:26:28,466
My mother?

1065
01:26:29,594 --> 01:26:32,684
She died much before I was born.

1066
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:42,633
I got this made especially for you.

1067
01:26:43,633 --> 01:26:44,716
This is an egg.

1068
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,424
Open it and see.

1069
01:26:52,716 --> 01:26:53,633
There's a fried chilly inside it.

1070
01:26:53,723 --> 01:26:55,216
Just for you.
- How sweet!

1071
01:26:55,341 --> 01:26:57,892
It's spicy, not sweet.
- It's spicy?

1072
01:26:58,257 --> 01:27:00,497
I love spicy stuff.
- Wait a moment.

1073
01:27:01,924 --> 01:27:06,377
Don't you know, you should
give it to the lady first?

1074
01:27:07,758 --> 01:27:08,649
I'm sorry.

1075
01:27:08,881 --> 01:27:11,091
I'll give it to her.

1076
01:27:11,562 --> 01:27:13,469
Please take this.
- Thank you.

1077
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:17,021
It's very tasty.

1078
01:27:17,111 --> 01:27:18,449
Really too good.
- Thank you.

1079
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:20,111
Did your wife make this?

1080
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:22,577
I'm unmarried.

1081
01:27:22,924 --> 01:27:24,041
You're unmarried?

1082
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:25,965
As of now, I am unmarried.

1083
01:27:26,981 --> 01:27:28,205
I haven't found the right girl.

1084
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:31,703
What are you saying, Chako?
How can that be possible?

1085
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,882
Any girl would want to marry you.

1086
01:27:35,007 --> 01:27:36,479
You mean it?
- Absolutely.

1087
01:27:36,749 --> 01:27:39,841
What does a girl look for in a man?
- What?

1088
01:27:39,989 --> 01:27:43,674
She doesn't want wealth or power,
she wants a kind-hearted man.

1089
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:46,707
Where else would she find
a kind-hearted man like you?

1090
01:27:47,472 --> 01:27:50,881
You're the king of this forest.

1091
01:27:51,444 --> 01:27:56,374
The girl who gets to be your queen,
will be the luckiest girl on earth.

1092
01:27:57,334 --> 01:27:58,384
Thanks.

1093
01:28:01,174 --> 01:28:02,353
Thanks.

1094
01:28:25,716 --> 01:28:27,325
This is my village.

1095
01:28:32,508 --> 01:28:33,709
What language is this?

1096
01:28:35,726 --> 01:28:36,924
Sorry.

1097
01:28:37,209 --> 01:28:39,123
It was Hindi.
- Hindi?

1098
01:28:39,851 --> 01:28:42,633
Yes, but I speak it like Hebrew.

1099
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:46,486
Mr Chako,
what are they getting ready for?

1100
01:28:46,576 --> 01:28:50,359
They're preparing for a feast.

1101
01:28:50,449 --> 01:28:54,340
When two moons appear on
the same night, we must celebrate.

1102
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,887
Two moons on the same night?
- Two moons on the same night.

1103
01:28:57,145 --> 01:28:59,247
One is up there in the sky

1104
01:29:00,142 --> 01:29:01,373
and the other is you.

1105
01:29:02,272 --> 01:29:04,088
Chako Uncle.

1106
01:29:06,884 --> 01:29:11,925
This is the drink, which will
intoxicate you immediately!

1107
01:29:15,054 --> 01:29:16,049
Thanks.

1108
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:20,334
Please have this one,
you'll love it.

1109
01:29:20,424 --> 01:29:21,538
Cheers!

1110
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,063
Where's my glass?

1111
01:29:28,117 --> 01:29:30,285
Cheers!
- Cheers.

1112
01:29:32,822 --> 01:29:36,825
I don't think this is intoxicating.
- What?

1113
01:29:36,915 --> 01:29:40,016
I think it's mind-blowing.
- Yes.

1114
01:29:40,781 --> 01:29:43,481
You are drunk, but I don't
need a drink to intoxicate me.

1115
01:29:43,682 --> 01:29:49,404
But wait, the musical program
is yet to begin. We shall dance.

1116
01:29:49,494 --> 01:29:53,716
Really?
- But not in these clothes.

1117
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,674
So let's change.
- Yes.

1118
01:30:39,716 --> 01:30:47,549
"The moment the sun sets,
I feel I'm walking on the clouds"

1119
01:30:48,758 --> 01:30:53,209
"Is it my youthful fervour,
or is it someone's love?"

1120
01:30:53,299 --> 01:30:56,905
"What is it that intoxicates me?"

1121
01:30:57,992 --> 01:31:02,471
"I searched every nook and corner"

1122
01:31:02,561 --> 01:31:07,001
"But love was not to be found"

1123
01:31:07,091 --> 01:31:16,427
"Every part of my being blossoms,
because I have found true love"

1124
01:31:16,591 --> 01:31:24,800
"The moment the sun sets,
I feel I'm walking on the clouds"

1125
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:30,509
"Is it my youthful fervour,
or is it someone's love?"

1126
01:31:30,599 --> 01:31:34,008
"What is it that intoxicates me?"

1127
01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:39,413
"I searched every nook and corner"

1128
01:31:39,503 --> 01:31:44,126
"But love was not to be found"

1129
01:31:44,216 --> 01:31:48,637
"I found my love,
yes I finally found it"

1130
01:31:48,727 --> 01:31:53,459
"My love is close to me"

1131
01:31:53,549 --> 01:32:01,632
"The moment the sun sets,
I feel I'm walking on the clouds"

1132
01:32:02,721 --> 01:32:10,758
"Is it my youthful fervour,
or is it someone's love?"

1133
01:32:44,257 --> 01:32:48,299
"This world
which thirsts for wealth"

1134
01:32:48,589 --> 01:32:52,845
"does not realise
that love is priceless"

1135
01:32:52,935 --> 01:32:57,432
"They fight battles in vain,"

1136
01:32:57,522 --> 01:33:02,813
"after all the world is round,
what goes around comes around"

1137
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:20,633
"The world should treat
love as a valuable thing"

1138
01:33:20,854 --> 01:33:30,163
"Great lovers like Romeo have
laid down their lives for love"

1139
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:35,171
"The power of love is greater than
any other power in the world"

1140
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:39,424
"This is all one needs to know"

1141
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:47,908
"Love is the supreme power"

1142
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:56,758
"The moment the sun sets,
I feel I'm walking on the clouds"

1143
01:33:57,361 --> 01:34:06,227
"Is it my youthful fervour,
or is it someone's love?"

1144
01:34:44,216 --> 01:34:48,758
"We have invented
rockets and satellites"

1145
01:34:48,848 --> 01:34:52,946
"The invention of the
computer is a great achievement"

1146
01:34:53,132 --> 01:34:59,591
"But if you haven't experienced
love, everything else is useless"

1147
01:35:02,591 --> 01:35:06,881
"I believe that
love makes the world go round"

1148
01:35:07,085 --> 01:35:12,881
"You need to
take lessons in the art of love"

1149
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:20,881
"I'm a worshipper of love"

1150
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:25,490
"I beseech you, to love me"

1151
01:35:25,674 --> 01:35:30,174
"For god's sake,
please listen to me"

1152
01:35:30,341 --> 01:35:34,427
"Please give me your love"

1153
01:35:53,145 --> 01:36:01,965
"The moment the sun sets,
I feel I'm walking on the clouds"

1154
01:36:02,366 --> 01:36:10,674
"Is it my youthful fervour,
or is it someone's love?"

1155
01:36:11,104 --> 01:36:15,800
"I searched every nook and corner"

1156
01:36:16,023 --> 01:36:20,418
"But love was not to be found"

1157
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:29,543
"Every part of my being blossoms,
because I have found true love"

1158
01:36:29,633 --> 01:36:38,091
"The moment the sun sets,
I feel I'm walking on the clouds"

1159
01:36:39,272 --> 01:36:47,132
"Is it my youthful fervour,
or is it someone's love?"

1160
01:37:19,607 --> 01:37:21,433
Where has he gone?

1161
01:37:21,913 --> 01:37:24,597
He must've gone to sleep.
- Gone to bed already?

1162
01:37:25,378 --> 01:37:26,741
How can he fall
sleep while you're awake?

1163
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:28,334
Very bad.
- Very bad.

1164
01:37:28,711 --> 01:37:30,242
Tell me something, Ram Lakhan.

1165
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:32,091
Ram Lakhan?
- Sorry!

1166
01:37:32,463 --> 01:37:33,591
I mean Daya Shankar.

1167
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:37,237
Daya Shankar, tell me,

1168
01:37:37,633 --> 01:37:40,268
how are you
related to Meena Kumari?

1169
01:37:40,434 --> 01:37:41,703
Meena Kumari?

1170
01:37:41,793 --> 01:37:45,685
I mean Angelina Jolie,
Uma, yes Uma Parvati.

1171
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,874
How am I related to him?

1172
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,285
None at all.
- None at all?

1173
01:37:51,785 --> 01:37:55,290
I met him yesterday,
while searching for my parents.

1174
01:37:56,611 --> 01:37:58,931
Is that all?

1175
01:38:03,229 --> 01:38:04,238
Mr Chako.

1176
01:38:05,403 --> 01:38:06,904
Mr Chako.

1177
01:38:08,026 --> 01:38:09,358
Mr Chako.

1178
01:38:10,004 --> 01:38:12,053
I'll go and get a drink.

1179
01:38:35,919 --> 01:38:37,655
Do you know, who he is?

1180
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:38,814
Who?

1181
01:38:40,584 --> 01:38:41,883
He's wanted.

1182
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,586
What happened?

1183
01:38:50,676 --> 01:38:55,101
I lied to you.
- You lied?

1184
01:38:55,191 --> 01:38:58,369
I was forced to lie.

1185
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:02,222
That Uma Parvati,

1186
01:39:03,264 --> 01:39:04,916
I really don't know him.

1187
01:39:06,092 --> 01:39:11,081
He had actually kidnapped me,
in the forest yesterday.

1188
01:39:11,494 --> 01:39:17,021
He threatened to kill me,
if I dared to reveal the truth.

1189
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,976
Daya Shankar, don't be afraid.

1190
01:39:23,493 --> 01:39:25,040
I'm with you.

1191
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:28,087
I have a big gun inside my house,

1192
01:39:29,019 --> 01:39:31,413
I'll protect you with that gun.

1193
01:39:32,112 --> 01:39:34,888
Trust me, I'll protect you.

1194
01:39:35,106 --> 01:39:37,043
I'll save you.

1195
01:39:40,569 --> 01:39:41,883
Thank you.

1196
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:49,702
Where were you?

1197
01:39:51,157 --> 01:39:54,666
I was sitting and talking to Chako.

1198
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:56,205
Chako?

1199
01:39:58,392 --> 01:40:01,422
Why do you waste your
time with that cartoon?

1200
01:40:02,507 --> 01:40:08,231
Just because
we're sharing this bed,

1201
01:40:09,078 --> 01:40:11,111
doesn't give you the
right to scold me like a husband.

1202
01:40:12,078 --> 01:40:14,661
I am not married to you.

1203
01:40:14,948 --> 01:40:16,216
Why don't you get married to me?

1204
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,291
What?
- Yes.

1205
01:40:19,081 --> 01:40:22,536
Me? Marry you?

1206
01:40:25,675 --> 01:40:26,536
Why?

1207
01:40:26,837 --> 01:40:27,985
What's wrong with me?

1208
01:40:28,297 --> 01:40:30,506
Have you ever been in love?

1209
01:40:31,593 --> 01:40:34,019
No, I have never
fallen in love with anyone.

1210
01:40:34,865 --> 01:40:36,379
But I can definitely try.

1211
01:40:36,955 --> 01:40:39,536
Come off it! You will try!

1212
01:40:39,626 --> 01:40:41,700
You don't know the meaning of love.

1213
01:40:45,763 --> 01:40:47,037
Bhawani,

1214
01:40:48,405 --> 01:40:49,411
who are you?

1215
01:40:50,447 --> 01:40:51,828
Where have you come from?

1216
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:53,828
Tell me...

1217
01:40:56,275 --> 01:40:57,369
Bhawani.

1218
01:41:27,787 --> 01:41:29,181
Have you seen this man?

1219
01:41:30,973 --> 01:41:36,828
"The moment the sun sets,
I feel I'm walking on the clouds"

1220
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:39,369
Yes, play it like this.
Push the right button

1221
01:41:39,539 --> 01:41:40,745
Now the left button.

1222
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,379
Good, very good.

1223
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:53,328
What's the matter?

1224
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,078
What are you thinking of?

1225
01:41:56,323 --> 01:41:57,495
I don't know.

1226
01:41:58,605 --> 01:42:00,766
I think,
something is terribly wrong.

1227
01:42:02,286 --> 01:42:07,134
Every single moment I feel,
that our mission is in danger.

1228
01:42:09,598 --> 01:42:14,532
We don't know what Pinki
wants or what he is up to.

1229
01:42:16,364 --> 01:42:19,787
We've been sitting here since
morning, as if we're on a picnic.

1230
01:42:19,877 --> 01:42:22,580
Pushkar,
destiny cannot be averted.

1231
01:42:24,634 --> 01:42:26,375
Just relax, okay.

1232
01:42:37,802 --> 01:42:39,561
Tarzan.
- Yes.

1233
01:42:39,724 --> 01:42:42,120
What do you think about love?

1234
01:42:46,818 --> 01:42:48,285
You heartless man.

1235
01:42:48,758 --> 01:42:50,655
How would you
know what love means?

1236
01:42:51,409 --> 01:42:54,098
I had fallen in love.

1237
01:42:54,686 --> 01:42:57,620
One should be
prepared to die, for love.

1238
01:42:57,761 --> 01:43:02,453
It wasn't
this kind of frivolous love.

1239
01:43:03,536 --> 01:43:06,582
She was extremely beautiful.

1240
01:43:06,933 --> 01:43:09,060
But I shot her one day.
- Why?

1241
01:43:11,179 --> 01:43:13,909
A new film
was playing in the theatres.

1242
01:43:14,097 --> 01:43:17,536
I suggested we go
for the late-night show.

1243
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:21,071
But she was adamant, she wanted
to go for the afternoon show.

1244
01:43:21,599 --> 01:43:24,453
I tried to reason with her,
to come for the night show.

1245
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,799
She put her foot down
and wouldn't budge.

1246
01:43:27,078 --> 01:43:28,328
I insisted on going for night show,

1247
01:43:28,418 --> 01:43:30,242
while she wanted
to go for noon show.

1248
01:43:31,411 --> 01:43:32,890
I shot her.
- What happened after that?

1249
01:43:33,601 --> 01:43:34,578
Nothing,

1250
01:43:34,668 --> 01:43:37,453
I attended the
night show with another girl.

1251
01:43:38,135 --> 01:43:40,411
But didn't she sacrifice her life?

1252
01:43:40,501 --> 01:43:42,411
One should be ready to die.

1253
01:43:42,536 --> 01:43:45,306
That is true love,
not all this hugging and kissing.

1254
01:43:50,661 --> 01:43:51,767
Okay.

1255
01:43:52,411 --> 01:43:55,752
Let's go, we've got him.
- We've got him.

1256
01:43:56,319 --> 01:43:57,797
And what do we do with him?

1257
01:44:01,046 --> 01:44:04,010
Just finish the
calves and bury them somewhere.

1258
01:44:04,172 --> 01:44:07,198
So that their father
thinks they are still, alive,

1259
01:44:07,288 --> 01:44:08,845
And our in our custody. Understood?

1260
01:44:08,935 --> 01:44:11,275
So that he does not
alert the police. Right?

1261
01:44:11,423 --> 01:44:15,392
You know what, son? We don't like
this violence either.

1262
01:44:15,621 --> 01:44:18,887
But there is no point in your living
in this ill-fated country?

1263
01:44:19,374 --> 01:44:20,761
This useless poverty!

1264
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:24,731
Scam! Scandal!
The ministers are thieves!

1265
01:44:24,821 --> 01:44:26,359
Criminals become ministers.

1266
01:44:27,085 --> 01:44:28,472
And should I tell you something?

1267
01:44:28,665 --> 01:44:31,761
If you grow up, there won't be
anyone around here.

1268
01:44:32,249 --> 01:44:34,069
This place will be barren.

1269
01:44:34,297 --> 01:44:37,642
So, which country will you work for
once you grow up, huh?

1270
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:41,070
At least, if you die now,
you will serve our purpose.

1271
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:42,888
Isn't it, sister-in-law?

1272
01:44:44,022 --> 01:44:45,864
Oh! Sister-in-law.

1273
01:44:46,464 --> 01:44:49,314
Vermillion on your parting,
and a bullet in your chest!

1274
01:44:49,482 --> 01:44:52,164
You will die as
a married woman, lady!

1275
01:44:54,342 --> 01:44:57,000
Son, say 'Jai Hind' one last time.

1276
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:59,616
Say it louder! 'Jai Hind!
- 'Jai Hind!'

1277
01:44:59,706 --> 01:45:00,774
Hmm. Kill him.

1278
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:48,057
"Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!"

1279
01:45:48,147 --> 01:45:51,889
"Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!"

1280
01:45:54,002 --> 01:45:54,997
"Everyone is restless"

1281
01:45:55,087 --> 01:45:56,218
"Run away"

1282
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:10,295
"Life's nothing
but a sprint to survive"

1283
01:46:10,385 --> 01:46:12,128
"Some lead, while some follow"

1284
01:46:12,218 --> 01:46:14,212
"Life is a
mad rush to achieve our goals"

1285
01:46:14,302 --> 01:46:17,837
"Either you run for wealth"

1286
01:46:17,927 --> 01:46:21,499
"Or you run for the sake of love"

1287
01:46:21,676 --> 01:46:23,419
"Either you run for wealth"

1288
01:46:23,509 --> 01:46:25,335
"Or you run for the sake of love"

1289
01:46:25,425 --> 01:46:27,968
"Everyone is restless"

1290
01:46:28,509 --> 01:46:32,260
"Everyone is restless"

1291
01:46:32,426 --> 01:46:36,128
"Life's nothing
but a sprint to survive"

1292
01:46:36,218 --> 01:46:37,962
"Some lead, while some follow"

1293
01:46:38,052 --> 01:46:40,010
"Life is a
mad rush to achieve our goals"

1294
01:47:04,052 --> 01:47:06,593
"The world has gone crazy"

1295
01:47:07,672 --> 01:47:10,425
"Everyone is restless"

1296
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:14,962
"Each one is
trapped in his own web"

1297
01:47:15,052 --> 01:47:22,218
"We are all running after something
like bees swarm over a honeycomb"

1298
01:47:22,509 --> 01:47:25,135
"Everyone is restless"

1299
01:47:26,131 --> 01:47:28,811
"Everyone is restless"

1300
01:47:30,968 --> 01:47:33,200
Hands up!

1301
01:47:33,425 --> 01:47:34,635
I said, hands up.

1302
01:47:35,052 --> 01:47:38,753
"Life's nothing
but a sprint to survive"

1303
01:47:38,843 --> 01:47:40,586
"Some lead, while some follow"

1304
01:47:40,676 --> 01:47:42,468
"Life is a
mad rush to achieve our goals"

1305
01:47:42,718 --> 01:47:45,760
"Either you run for wealth"

1306
01:47:46,425 --> 01:47:49,425
"Or you run for the sake of love"

1307
01:47:50,093 --> 01:47:51,920
"Either you run for wealth"

1308
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:53,753
"Or you run for the sake of love"

1309
01:47:53,843 --> 01:47:56,385
"Everyone is restless"

1310
01:47:56,968 --> 01:48:00,760
"Everyone is restless"

1311
01:48:24,551 --> 01:48:27,711
Sir!
- I'm sure they went that way.

1312
01:48:27,801 --> 01:48:30,302
Maybe that way.

1313
01:48:30,468 --> 01:48:32,468
Did they inform you before leaving?

1314
01:48:33,718 --> 01:48:35,503
You go there.

1315
01:48:35,593 --> 01:48:37,419
This way!
- Shut up.

1316
01:48:37,509 --> 01:48:41,263
You go that way
and the rest follow me.

1317
01:48:41,718 --> 01:48:44,177
"Everyone is restless"

1318
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,335
Shree, I'm sure they went that way,

1319
01:48:46,425 --> 01:48:49,052
if I'm proved wrong, I'll resign.

1320
01:48:49,302 --> 01:48:50,878
Get going!
- Sir!

1321
01:48:50,968 --> 01:48:52,015
Go!
- Sir!

1322
01:48:52,105 --> 01:48:54,335
Get going!
- "Some lead, while some follow"

1323
01:48:54,425 --> 01:48:56,419
"Life is a
mad rush to achieve our goals"

1324
01:48:56,509 --> 01:48:58,977
"Either you run for wealth"

1325
01:49:00,218 --> 01:49:02,385
"Or you run for the sake of love"

1326
01:49:03,885 --> 01:49:05,676
"Either you run for wealth"

1327
01:49:05,766 --> 01:49:07,461
"Or you run for the sake of love"

1328
01:49:07,551 --> 01:49:10,093
"Everyone is restless"

1329
01:49:10,679 --> 01:49:12,302
"Everyone is restless"

1330
01:49:12,392 --> 01:49:14,760
"Everyone is restless"

1331
01:49:40,468 --> 01:49:43,084
We want a lift, please.

1332
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,302
We're sorry, no place.

1333
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:20,942
Why can't you drive slowly?
We are going to fall!

1334
01:50:21,291 --> 01:50:24,364
You led me on a wild goose chase.
Now you're screaming your lungs out.

1335
01:50:24,454 --> 01:50:25,737
The cops were chasing us.

1336
01:50:25,827 --> 01:50:27,043
We could've
met with an accident at that time.

1337
01:50:27,133 --> 01:50:30,214
We didn't have a choice then.
- We don't have a choice now.

1338
01:50:30,522 --> 01:50:33,729
Look, we must reach the city,
before we run out of fuel.

1339
01:50:34,438 --> 01:50:38,042
But if you drive like this,
we're sure to die.

1340
01:50:38,188 --> 01:50:39,348
No problem.

1341
01:50:39,438 --> 01:50:42,896
We'll break our limbs.
- So be it.

1342
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:47,105
Are you out of your mind?
- Yes, I've gone crazy.

1343
01:50:48,230 --> 01:50:49,355
What's on your mind?

1344
01:50:49,445 --> 01:50:51,105
You want to know?
- Yes.

1345
01:50:51,239 --> 01:50:52,771
Should I?
- Yes.

1346
01:50:53,163 --> 01:50:54,443
I want to sing a song.

1347
01:51:12,685 --> 01:51:22,124
"We are lovers"

1348
01:51:23,078 --> 01:51:27,221
"We are madly in love"

1349
01:51:27,311 --> 01:51:31,272
"We live in a world of our own"

1350
01:51:32,284 --> 01:51:35,757
"We have no cares in this world"

1351
01:51:35,847 --> 01:51:45,602
"We are lovers"

1352
01:51:46,107 --> 01:51:50,596
"We are madly in love"

1353
01:51:50,686 --> 01:51:54,355
"We live in a world of our own"

1354
01:51:55,321 --> 01:51:58,555
"We have no cares in this world"

1355
01:51:58,881 --> 01:52:04,353
"We are lovers"

1356
01:52:40,907 --> 01:52:45,395
"Our life is immersed in love"

1357
01:52:45,485 --> 01:52:50,001
"Where will this
amazing feeling lead us to?"

1358
01:52:50,091 --> 01:52:54,661
"Our lives have taken a different
turn, we walk the path of love"

1359
01:52:54,751 --> 01:52:59,220
"Darling let's set out
on an unknown journey"

1360
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:08,077
"We are lovers"

1361
01:53:09,071 --> 01:53:13,136
"We are madly in love"

1362
01:53:13,226 --> 01:53:17,678
"It's a lovely evening,
we can rest a while"

1363
01:53:17,768 --> 01:53:22,255
"A lot needs to be done,
God will take care of the rest"

1364
01:53:22,345 --> 01:53:31,393
"We are lovers"

1365
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:27,330
"Sooner or later,
we shall reach our destination..."

1366
01:54:27,579 --> 01:54:32,072
"Like the rivers find
their shores..."

1367
01:54:32,162 --> 01:54:36,667
"Like the stars and the moon
meet in the night sky..."

1368
01:54:36,757 --> 01:54:41,345
"Just as the eyes
seek scenic beauty..."

1369
01:54:41,435 --> 01:54:45,942
"Just as the bees
find flowers..."

1370
01:54:46,032 --> 01:54:50,550
"Like a canoe
moves with the help of waves..."

1371
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:55,112
"Hearts find their love."

1372
01:54:55,202 --> 01:54:59,755
"Just as the spring
arrives in a garden.."

1373
01:54:59,845 --> 01:55:03,749
"We will also find our destination."

1374
01:55:03,839 --> 01:55:08,589
"There is nothing to worry about,
now that we are together"

1375
01:55:08,679 --> 01:55:12,461
"The path of love beckons us"

1376
01:55:12,551 --> 01:55:22,814
"We are lovers"

1377
01:55:22,904 --> 01:55:26,984
"We are madly in love"

1378
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:31,417
"We live in a world of our own"

1379
01:55:32,151 --> 01:55:36,061
"We have no cares in this world"

1380
01:55:36,151 --> 01:55:45,963
"We are lovers...
- We are lovers"

1381
01:55:46,053 --> 01:55:52,005
"We are madly in love...
- We are madly in love"

1382
01:57:02,548 --> 01:57:04,134
What are they doing
in a clothes store?

1383
01:57:04,536 --> 01:57:05,771
They're relishing sandwiches.

1384
01:57:06,131 --> 01:57:07,481
Sandwiches in a garment store?

1385
01:57:07,664 --> 01:57:09,522
They'll buy clothes
from a sandwich store.

1386
01:57:09,651 --> 01:57:10,818
He's joking.

1387
01:57:12,006 --> 01:57:14,693
Just a moment, please.
What do you want?

1388
01:57:14,858 --> 01:57:17,198
Two muffins and two burgers.
- Along with red chili sauce.

1389
01:57:17,484 --> 01:57:18,467
What?

1390
01:57:18,654 --> 01:57:19,721
You idiot!

1391
01:57:19,875 --> 01:57:22,402
We're here to buy clothes.

1392
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:24,632
We don't sell
old-fashioned clothes.

1393
01:57:24,722 --> 01:57:27,526
Do I look old-fashioned to you?

1394
01:57:27,616 --> 01:57:29,901
No, I was just...

1395
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:32,391
Don't think,
show us some clothes.

1396
01:57:38,193 --> 01:57:41,648
Just a minute, please.
I'll help you with it.

1397
01:57:42,961 --> 01:57:45,612
I want these pants.
How much is it for?

1398
01:57:46,803 --> 01:57:48,331
It's priced at Rs 1200.

1399
01:57:48,421 --> 01:57:50,983
I don't want to buy a dozen,
just this one.

1400
01:57:51,271 --> 01:57:53,774
Only one costs Rs 1200.

1401
01:57:53,864 --> 01:57:56,448
That's the market price,
but how much will you settle for?

1402
01:57:56,538 --> 01:58:00,162
Look ma'am,
this is a designer pant.

1403
01:58:00,436 --> 01:58:02,874
It has been imported from America.

1404
01:58:04,754 --> 01:58:07,217
Whether it has been
imported from America or Africa,

1405
01:58:07,937 --> 01:58:10,655
a pant is a pant,
isn't it? You idiot?

1406
01:58:18,534 --> 01:58:21,174
Can I help you, please?

1407
01:58:21,858 --> 01:58:23,826
Show me a cool shirt.

1408
01:58:25,116 --> 01:58:26,693
Would you like to
see a designer shirt?

1409
01:58:26,783 --> 01:58:29,568
Do I look like someone
who wears designer shirts?

1410
01:58:29,658 --> 01:58:32,317
Daya Shankar,
will this shirt look good on me?

1411
01:58:32,407 --> 01:58:35,084
Let me ask this idiot
how much does my shirt cost?

1412
01:58:35,409 --> 01:58:38,116
Excuse me,
please don't call me an idiot.

1413
01:58:38,206 --> 01:58:39,569
Okay, idiot.

1414
01:58:41,234 --> 01:58:42,276
Idiot!

1415
01:58:43,409 --> 01:58:45,113
How much is this for?

1416
01:58:45,203 --> 01:58:47,110
It costs Rs 2500.

1417
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,401
Do you mean along
with the mannequin?

1418
01:58:48,953 --> 01:58:50,093
The shirt alone costs Rs 2500.

1419
01:58:50,183 --> 01:58:51,979
The mannequin costs Rs 10,000.
- 10,000!

1420
01:58:52,369 --> 01:58:54,936
For that money, I can
get you a real girl to stand here.

1421
01:58:55,026 --> 01:58:55,822
Daya Shankar,

1422
01:58:55,912 --> 01:58:57,500
please I want this dress.
- What are you saying!

1423
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:59,020
Madam please carefully!

1424
01:58:59,110 --> 01:59:00,791
What are you doing?
Look you've dropped it.

1425
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:02,561
Please put the wig on the head.
- Sorry...

1426
01:59:02,651 --> 01:59:05,311
Put it on the head.
- Please I must have this dress.

1427
01:59:05,401 --> 01:59:08,062
Please put it on
mannequin's head, not mine.

1428
01:59:08,152 --> 01:59:08,918
I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1429
01:59:09,008 --> 01:59:12,026
I'm sorry, but I want this dress.

1430
01:59:12,528 --> 01:59:13,493
I said I'm sorry...
- Please put it properly.

1431
01:59:13,583 --> 01:59:16,110
Put it properly.
- I'm trying my best.

1432
01:59:17,001 --> 01:59:19,609
Look, I'm really sorry.
Idiot, please.

1433
01:59:19,699 --> 01:59:21,901
Let it be!

1434
01:59:21,991 --> 01:59:23,317
Idiot.
- Yes.

1435
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:26,495
Won't you give me discount?
- No.

1436
01:59:26,585 --> 01:59:29,154
Do you want me to
roam around in these dowdy clothes?

1437
01:59:29,244 --> 01:59:32,609
You can't do this to me, please.

1438
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:35,401
Just a small discount, baby.
- Okay, all right.

1439
01:59:36,009 --> 01:59:37,016
I'll do something.

1440
01:59:37,106 --> 01:59:38,313
Promise?
- Yes.

1441
01:59:38,865 --> 01:59:42,568
Daya Shankar, the idiot has
agreed to give us a discount.

1442
01:59:42,813 --> 01:59:44,568
Pack it, baby,

1443
01:59:45,663 --> 01:59:46,693
Boss,

1444
01:59:47,818 --> 01:59:49,317
now that
I've given you the clothes,

1445
01:59:49,907 --> 01:59:52,445
please tell me,
why are you calling me an idiot?

1446
02:00:06,954 --> 02:00:09,354
Where have you brought me?
- You wanted the gold, didn't you?

1447
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:12,168
Yes I did.
But who keeps gold in such a place?

1448
02:00:15,217 --> 02:00:16,501
I see,

1449
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:20,207
lift it slowly.

1450
02:00:25,121 --> 02:00:26,705
It sure is heavy.

1451
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,506
How do we open it?

1452
02:00:31,596 --> 02:00:34,068
We'll have to break it open.
- Then hurry up, Nandu.

1453
02:00:43,999 --> 02:00:45,295
Who are they?

1454
02:00:45,686 --> 02:00:47,264
I don't know.

1455
02:00:48,368 --> 02:00:49,992
How many more people are after you?

1456
02:00:50,992 --> 02:00:52,545
I said I don't know them.

1457
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:54,992
If you don't them,
why have they come here?

1458
02:00:55,243 --> 02:00:56,486
You don't trust me...

1459
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,742
I do, but..
- You're always fighting.

1460
02:00:58,076 --> 02:01:01,235
I said I don't know them.
- I'm not fighting, you are.

1461
02:01:01,368 --> 02:01:02,493
Am I a liar?

1462
02:01:35,742 --> 02:01:36,867
Who are you?

1463
02:01:44,034 --> 02:01:46,909
You made us travel 580 km.

1464
02:01:47,742 --> 02:01:50,284
I had to burn fuel worth Rs 3000.

1465
02:01:51,576 --> 02:01:54,992
I was tired of
driving around the countryside.

1466
02:01:55,659 --> 02:01:58,535
What do you think of yourself?

1467
02:01:58,826 --> 02:01:59,784
No.

1468
02:02:01,576 --> 02:02:02,784
Oh god!

1469
02:02:03,617 --> 02:02:05,992
Why did you scream, sugar pie?

1470
02:02:08,617 --> 02:02:10,742
Are you in love, with Rambo?

1471
02:02:11,867 --> 02:02:14,034
Are you crazy about his body?

1472
02:02:15,493 --> 02:02:19,576
Who are you
trying to impress, Rambo?

1473
02:02:33,659 --> 02:02:37,700
God has put in all
his artistry to make you.

1474
02:02:39,535 --> 02:02:40,909
Don't you dare touch her!

1475
02:02:42,826 --> 02:02:44,118
So what do you want me to do?

1476
02:02:44,284 --> 02:02:45,451
Should I stand here
like a crippled man?

1477
02:02:48,775 --> 02:02:54,448
I will kiss your fair lips so hard
that they will bleed red...

1478
02:02:54,538 --> 02:02:56,053
Stop it, Pinki.
- Shut up.

1479
02:02:56,449 --> 02:03:00,164
If you meddle in my affairs,
I'll shoot you in the head.

1480
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:07,622
Come!

1481
02:03:08,414 --> 02:03:11,245
Come baby, come.

1482
02:03:14,392 --> 02:03:16,497
Rascal!

1483
02:03:18,338 --> 02:03:21,789
If anyone dares to move,
I'll blow off your heads.

1484
02:03:23,247 --> 02:03:24,872
Pinki, let go of her hand.

1485
02:03:25,247 --> 02:03:26,497
I said, let her go.

1486
02:03:27,414 --> 02:03:31,206
Pinki, ask your men to
put down their guns.

1487
02:03:31,582 --> 02:03:33,454
Let Daya Shankar to come to me.

1488
02:03:33,664 --> 02:03:34,664
Didn't you hear what I said?

1489
02:03:34,914 --> 02:03:36,039
Hurry up.

1490
02:05:31,414 --> 02:05:33,580
Why are you running after me?

1491
02:05:33,789 --> 02:05:35,289
Go and look for them.

1492
02:06:03,997 --> 02:06:05,289
Run!

1493
02:06:06,872 --> 02:06:07,956
Run!

1494
02:06:08,914 --> 02:06:10,039
I said run.

1495
02:06:12,164 --> 02:06:13,164
So you won't.

1496
02:06:13,789 --> 02:06:15,081
You won't.

1497
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:16,538
All right.

1498
02:07:08,215 --> 02:07:09,571
Daya Shankar.

1499
02:07:09,745 --> 02:07:10,717
What's going on?

1500
02:07:10,807 --> 02:07:12,364
Mr Chako,

1501
02:07:12,981 --> 02:07:15,272
I lied to you.
- You lied?

1502
02:07:15,479 --> 02:07:18,981
I lied to you about being,
kidnapped by Nandu.

1503
02:07:19,193 --> 02:07:20,231
Who is Nandu?

1504
02:07:20,498 --> 02:07:21,828
I mean Uma Parvati,

1505
02:07:22,231 --> 02:07:25,605
his real name is G Nandkumar.

1506
02:07:25,889 --> 02:07:28,022
He's a police inspector.

1507
02:07:28,571 --> 02:07:30,689
My name is not Daya Shankar.

1508
02:07:31,022 --> 02:07:34,897
I'm P Bhawani,
I'm also a deputy inspector.

1509
02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:40,231
Both of us are on a mission to nab,
an international gang.

1510
02:07:40,398 --> 02:07:42,398
All this
is a part of that investigation.

1511
02:07:43,553 --> 02:07:47,689
I see.
But why are the cops chasing you?

1512
02:07:47,987 --> 02:07:49,647
It is a covert operation.

1513
02:07:50,334 --> 02:07:51,849
The entire police
department is not aware of it.

1514
02:07:51,939 --> 02:07:53,182
They are not supposed to know.

1515
02:07:53,272 --> 02:07:55,231
I get it now.

1516
02:08:17,106 --> 02:08:18,314
Oh god!

1517
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:20,855
I don't have bullets.

1518
02:08:23,981 --> 02:08:25,106
Who?

1519
02:08:28,685 --> 02:08:30,439
You idiot!

1520
02:08:31,046 --> 02:08:32,730
Why didn't you tell me, it was you?

1521
02:08:32,903 --> 02:08:34,563
I would have saved some bullets.

1522
02:08:34,727 --> 02:08:35,939
Idiot!

1523
02:08:36,175 --> 02:08:38,807
You didn't allow me to speak,
you simply showered the shots.

1524
02:08:38,897 --> 02:08:40,064
I couldn't help it.

1525
02:08:52,398 --> 02:08:55,272
I've broken my hand, help.

1526
02:08:56,231 --> 02:08:58,224
You stone man!

1527
02:08:58,314 --> 02:09:01,432
You crushed my hand,
someone get me ice.

1528
02:09:01,522 --> 02:09:02,897
Hands up!

1529
02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:09,814
Have all of you come to
spy on me or to get those rascals?

1530
02:09:10,356 --> 02:09:12,189
Get me ice.

1531
02:09:19,730 --> 02:09:22,897
That's enough, baby doll.
Come out, everyone.

1532
02:09:23,479 --> 02:09:24,480
That's it.

1533
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:27,480
Someone get me ice.

1534
02:09:28,439 --> 02:09:32,522
Pinki, let those two play hide
and seek. We'll leave with the box.

1535
02:09:33,314 --> 02:09:34,327
Check his hand.

1536
02:09:34,479 --> 02:09:37,939
He broke my hand.
- Move fast.

1537
02:09:43,897 --> 02:09:44,855
Lift it.

1538
02:09:45,827 --> 02:09:46,973
It's the police, run.
- Let's run.

1539
02:09:47,063 --> 02:09:48,398
That side, quick.
- Let's run.

1540
02:10:01,974 --> 02:10:04,022
Hands up!

1541
02:10:20,314 --> 02:10:22,473
Nandu, let's follow them,
they're leaving with the gold.

1542
02:10:22,723 --> 02:10:24,064
Let them go.
- What do you mean?

1543
02:10:24,342 --> 02:10:25,327
I said let them take it.

1544
02:10:25,417 --> 02:10:27,769
How can we let go of
the thing we were running after?

1545
02:10:27,859 --> 02:10:28,831
Look, Bhawani.

1546
02:10:29,237 --> 02:10:32,771
I don't want that gold if I have
to put your life in danger for it.

1547
02:10:36,021 --> 02:10:39,771
I have been running all my life
and I've stolen a lot of things.

1548
02:10:41,382 --> 02:10:42,438
But...

1549
02:10:50,284 --> 02:10:54,605
Bhawani, I always thought money was
the most important thing in life.

1550
02:10:55,861 --> 02:10:57,230
But not anymore.

1551
02:10:57,535 --> 02:10:58,688
Nandu,

1552
02:10:59,059 --> 02:11:00,896
what are you saying?

1553
02:11:02,415 --> 02:11:05,313
Bhawani, I'm trying to say...

1554
02:11:07,511 --> 02:11:08,688
I love you.

1555
02:12:42,411 --> 02:12:46,471
"You can take my life and my youth"

1556
02:12:46,561 --> 02:12:54,596
"You can take everything,
but please give me love"

1557
02:12:54,686 --> 02:12:59,051
"My sweetheart, my love"

1558
02:12:59,141 --> 02:13:02,998
"What good
is this life without love?"

1559
02:13:03,088 --> 02:13:07,176
"Youth without love is meaningless"

1560
02:13:07,266 --> 02:13:12,301
"Everything is futile without love"

1561
02:13:12,494 --> 02:13:17,593
"A life without love
is not worth living"

1562
02:13:19,131 --> 02:13:23,166
"Take away my life and my youth,"

1563
02:13:23,256 --> 02:13:31,333
"You can take everything,
but please give me love"

1564
02:13:31,423 --> 02:13:35,381
"My sweetheart, my love"

1565
02:13:35,797 --> 02:13:39,790
"What good
is this life without love?"

1566
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:43,797
"Youth without love is meaningless"

1567
02:13:43,922 --> 02:13:49,160
"Everything is futile without love"

1568
02:13:49,339 --> 02:13:54,880
"A life without love
is not worth living"

1569
02:13:55,839 --> 02:14:03,630
"You can take my life and my youth"

1570
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:08,006
"You can take everything,
but please give me love"

1571
02:14:08,096 --> 02:14:12,006
"My sweetheart, my love"

1572
02:14:59,114 --> 02:15:02,694
"Let this burning
passion of love, engulf my being"

1573
02:15:02,874 --> 02:15:07,076
"I am ready to
sacrifice my life, for your love "

1574
02:15:07,166 --> 02:15:10,999
"I am also
yearning to unite with you"

1575
02:15:11,089 --> 02:15:14,784
"The pangs of love torment us"

1576
02:15:14,874 --> 02:15:18,825
"The love that
ignited desire in our hearts"

1577
02:15:18,915 --> 02:15:22,909
"has now turned into
a flame that consumes us"

1578
02:15:22,999 --> 02:15:31,681
"I'm willing to
surrender myself to you"

1579
02:15:31,771 --> 02:15:35,575
"You can take my life and my youth"

1580
02:15:35,665 --> 02:15:43,665
"You can take everything,
but please give me love"

1581
02:15:43,755 --> 02:15:47,885
"My sweetheart, my love"

1582
02:15:48,230 --> 02:15:51,974
"What good
is this life without love?"

1583
02:15:52,462 --> 02:15:56,283
"Youth without love is meaningless"

1584
02:15:56,373 --> 02:16:01,540
"Everything is futile without love"

1585
02:16:01,783 --> 02:16:07,331
"A life without love
is not worth living"

1586
02:16:57,233 --> 02:17:05,097
"Your magnetism
draws me closer to you."

1587
02:17:05,310 --> 02:17:13,026
"However much I try but my heart
doesn't want to stay away from you."

1588
02:17:13,116 --> 02:17:17,128
"We are like one
soul in two bodies..."

1589
02:17:17,218 --> 02:17:21,122
"If you are a spark,
I am the dewdrop."

1590
02:17:21,212 --> 02:17:25,228
"Your ways
are absolutely mesmerising."

1591
02:17:25,318 --> 02:17:29,796
"You live in my heart."

1592
02:17:29,886 --> 02:17:37,828
"My life is yours...
So is my youth, my love."

1593
02:17:38,017 --> 02:17:45,608
"You can take
whatever you want from me."

1594
02:17:46,458 --> 02:17:50,544
"What is life without love?"

1595
02:17:50,634 --> 02:17:54,582
"What is youth without love?"

1596
02:17:54,672 --> 02:18:00,021
"All this means
nothing without love."

1597
02:18:00,111 --> 02:18:05,853
"Oh, my love!"

1598
02:18:09,452 --> 02:18:13,150
Sir, Dongri police have arrested
a man who was firing shots.

1599
02:18:13,398 --> 02:18:15,357
He's the same man
we had met in the village.

1600
02:18:15,651 --> 02:18:17,724
He says, he has seen that box.

1601
02:18:28,459 --> 02:18:30,211
So this is where you stay.

1602
02:18:30,543 --> 02:18:33,127
Nandu,
didn't you find any other place?

1603
02:18:33,992 --> 02:18:36,294
Bhawani, I used to live alone.

1604
02:18:36,708 --> 02:18:39,753
A home was place to sleep at night.

1605
02:18:40,585 --> 02:18:42,419
But now that you're here,

1606
02:18:43,793 --> 02:18:45,543
I'll change the look of the house.

1607
02:18:46,127 --> 02:18:48,459
The kitchen could be on that side.

1608
02:18:48,710 --> 02:18:50,710
We'll have a
dining table in the centre.

1609
02:18:50,835 --> 02:18:52,086
That will be our bedroom.

1610
02:18:52,258 --> 02:18:53,752
We must have two bedrooms.

1611
02:18:53,961 --> 02:18:55,169
What do we need two bedrooms for?

1612
02:18:55,336 --> 02:18:57,115
I'll explain, come sit next to me.

1613
02:18:58,211 --> 02:19:01,229
We fight very frequently.

1614
02:19:01,752 --> 02:19:03,086
The day we fight,

1615
02:19:03,176 --> 02:19:06,044
I'll shift you to the other room.

1616
02:19:06,211 --> 02:19:09,044
Bhawani,
we are talking of marriage

1617
02:19:09,247 --> 02:19:10,687
and you are talking about quarrels.

1618
02:19:11,543 --> 02:19:13,794
My dear,
you must give love a chance.

1619
02:19:14,002 --> 02:19:16,385
I'm sorry,
but I've always been like this.

1620
02:19:16,543 --> 02:19:19,835
Now that we have decided to marry,

1621
02:19:21,502 --> 02:19:23,794
tell me, who are you?

1622
02:19:24,086 --> 02:19:26,459
Where have you come from?
Who are your parents?

1623
02:19:38,086 --> 02:19:39,002
Shree
- Yes sir.

1624
02:19:39,127 --> 02:19:40,127
You may look there.

1625
02:19:40,252 --> 02:19:41,252
Rana
- Yes sir.

1626
02:19:41,378 --> 02:19:42,336
Come with me.

1627
02:19:45,794 --> 02:19:47,044
Check the backdoor.

1628
02:19:48,378 --> 02:19:49,835
Go and look there.
- Yes, sir.

1629
02:19:49,961 --> 02:19:51,585
Over there?
- Yes, near those bins.

1630
02:19:51,889 --> 02:19:53,169
Sir.
- Yes.

1631
02:19:53,419 --> 02:19:55,669
I think this is an old factory.

1632
02:19:59,504 --> 02:20:01,459
An old factory?
- Yes, sir.

1633
02:20:02,127 --> 02:20:05,419
I think this was a five star hotel.

1634
02:20:05,576 --> 02:20:08,211
How can you think
this was a five-star hotel?

1635
02:20:08,504 --> 02:20:09,502
What's the matter?

1636
02:20:09,627 --> 02:20:11,336
Sir says,
this was a five-star hotel.

1637
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:13,162
A five star hotel?
- Yes.

1638
02:20:13,252 --> 02:20:14,194
Rana.

1639
02:20:14,803 --> 02:20:16,591
Yes, sir, I agree with you.

1640
02:20:18,715 --> 02:20:21,627
Please go and look there.

1641
02:20:22,086 --> 02:20:24,127
Shree, please look outside.

1642
02:20:25,669 --> 02:20:27,294
Get lost!
- Yes, sir.

1643
02:20:28,789 --> 02:20:29,867
Mr Desai.
- Yes?

1644
02:20:29,957 --> 02:20:32,507
If you suspect the slightest
radiation from anything,

1645
02:20:32,597 --> 02:20:33,669
call me right away.

1646
02:20:33,815 --> 02:20:34,751
Right, sir.
- Yeah, doctor.

1647
02:20:34,841 --> 02:20:37,313
Dr Rai? You...
How come you are here?

1648
02:20:37,403 --> 02:20:38,885
You?
- And who are these people?

1649
02:20:38,975 --> 02:20:40,373
You, please step aside?

1650
02:20:45,295 --> 02:20:46,524
I am sorry, Mr Nair.

1651
02:20:47,114 --> 02:20:49,754
But, we have kept
a secret from you all this while.

1652
02:20:51,078 --> 02:20:52,441
That box doesn't contain gold.

1653
02:20:54,850 --> 02:20:56,727
So, what is inside that box, Dr Rai?

1654
02:20:57,422 --> 02:20:58,544
Neutron bomb.

1655
02:20:59,376 --> 02:21:00,225
What?

1656
02:21:00,315 --> 02:21:02,524
Actually, we could not trust anyone.

1657
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:05,490
Please try to understand, Mr Nair.

1658
02:21:06,269 --> 02:21:09,715
Even now, we will have to take
extreme caution with each step.

1659
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:12,537
If this news gets out.

1660
02:21:13,143 --> 02:21:16,359
So... So the people in the city
will become anxious and fearful.

1661
02:21:16,449 --> 02:21:17,919
There will be rumours.

1662
02:21:18,009 --> 02:21:19,269
It will cause chaos.

1663
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:22,196
And then... Mr Nair, it will be
very difficult

1664
02:21:22,286 --> 02:21:24,147
to handle the situation.

1665
02:21:24,296 --> 02:21:25,683
I hope you understand
what I am saying?

1666
02:21:31,078 --> 02:21:32,938
Nandu... Nandu,
what were they discussing?

1667
02:21:33,028 --> 02:21:34,461
Hey, that is a neutron bomb.

1668
02:21:34,551 --> 02:21:36,028
What is a neutron bomb?

1669
02:21:36,118 --> 02:21:38,116
Hey, it's the same thing that
exploded in Japan

1670
02:21:38,206 --> 02:21:39,143
and thousands of people died.

1671
02:21:39,233 --> 02:21:40,283
What are you saying?
- Huh!

1672
02:21:40,373 --> 02:21:42,036
So then, why have they come here?
- How would I know?

1673
02:21:42,126 --> 02:21:44,004
Who are these guys, nandu?
- Hey, how would I know?

1674
02:21:44,094 --> 02:21:46,416
But, Nandu why have
they come to this city?

1675
02:21:46,506 --> 02:21:48,240
They probably want to
destroy the entire city. - Huh!

1676
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:49,368
What are you saying?

1677
02:21:49,458 --> 02:21:52,194
Hey, let's run. Let's get out of
this city! Come on!

1678
02:21:55,904 --> 02:21:56,906
Wake up.

1679
02:21:56,996 --> 02:21:58,962
Drive the cab. Hurry up, move.

1680
02:21:59,052 --> 02:22:00,557
Hurry up.
- Wait.

1681
02:22:00,647 --> 02:22:03,484
Wake up, I said.
- What's wrong?

1682
02:22:03,644 --> 02:22:05,940
Drive.
- Where do you want to go?

1683
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:08,205
Why don't you start driving?
Hurry up, take us anywhere.

1684
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:09,397
But where do you want to go?

1685
02:22:09,487 --> 02:22:12,274
I won't take
a passenger for a short distance.

1686
02:22:12,364 --> 02:22:14,640
You'll get the fare, just move.

1687
02:22:14,730 --> 02:22:16,690
You don't understand?
I must get return fare as well.

1688
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:18,098
Who will come back here?

1689
02:22:18,188 --> 02:22:20,973
Where do you want to go?
- Why don't you listen to us?

1690
02:22:21,063 --> 02:22:23,039
Ma'am,
you don't understand my problem.

1691
02:22:23,129 --> 02:22:25,384
You are educated,
why are you behaving like this?

1692
02:22:25,474 --> 02:22:28,223
But where do you want to go?

1693
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:30,584
What are you saying?

1694
02:22:31,416 --> 02:22:35,242
I'm saying,
there will be a cricket match.

1695
02:22:35,792 --> 02:22:37,375
Two teams,
representing two countries.

1696
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,799
The stadium will be
packed with cricket fans.

1697
02:22:41,353 --> 02:22:43,381
Thousands will throng the stadium.

1698
02:22:43,573 --> 02:22:46,441
Viewers from 26 countries will
be watching it on television.

1699
02:22:46,531 --> 02:22:49,429
Live telecast!

1700
02:22:49,897 --> 02:22:54,126
Wasim Akram will bowl,
while Sachin Tendulkar will bat.

1701
02:22:54,216 --> 02:22:56,731
We will bomb the stadium!

1702
02:22:56,965 --> 02:23:00,126
One blast
will kill thousands of people.

1703
02:23:00,445 --> 02:23:03,834
They will be wiped out
of the face of this earth.

1704
02:23:04,039 --> 02:23:07,209
There'll be
no ground and no wicket,

1705
02:23:07,299 --> 02:23:10,027
because I hate cricket.

1706
02:23:10,279 --> 02:23:12,625
What a scene that will be!

1707
02:23:13,499 --> 02:23:14,825
Pinki, you have gone mad.

1708
02:23:15,689 --> 02:23:18,458
This blast is meant to make the
government aware of our power,

1709
02:23:18,548 --> 02:23:19,802
so that they fulfil our demands.

1710
02:23:20,627 --> 02:23:22,725
Those innocent people
have nothing to do with this.

1711
02:23:22,815 --> 02:23:24,304
It is not our aim to kill them.

1712
02:23:24,476 --> 02:23:27,749
It might not be your aim,
but it is mine.

1713
02:23:28,064 --> 02:23:30,206
Just give it a thought, Pushkar.

1714
02:23:30,417 --> 02:23:32,252
Nothing like this
has happened ever before.

1715
02:23:32,342 --> 02:23:35,354
Have you seen so many people
being killed at one time?

1716
02:23:35,636 --> 02:23:40,030
Reporters from all the television
channels worldwide will be here,

1717
02:23:40,120 --> 02:23:43,151
to cover this event.

1718
02:23:43,436 --> 02:23:47,824
Little do those rascals know,
they too shall perish.

1719
02:23:49,114 --> 02:23:52,145
A great match in Eden,
everyone will go to heaven.

1720
02:23:52,235 --> 02:23:53,375
Just a moment.

1721
02:23:53,465 --> 02:23:56,591
If this is what you want,
then count me out of this.

1722
02:23:56,789 --> 02:23:59,374
I'll kill you
if you're not with me.

1723
02:23:59,464 --> 02:24:02,500
You'll have no fun on the run,
since it's me who has the gun.

1724
02:24:03,053 --> 02:24:06,364
Pushkar!
Suvarna, please make him see sense.

1725
02:24:06,454 --> 02:24:08,016
He's being a spoilt sport.

1726
02:24:08,106 --> 02:24:11,959
Give me the freedom,
and I'll show you what I can do.

1727
02:24:12,204 --> 02:24:13,709
Please!

1728
02:24:14,628 --> 02:24:18,258
Don't go away,
see you after the blast!

1729
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:20,808
But why did you
have to steal the bomb?

1730
02:24:20,898 --> 02:24:24,376
Do you think, I would steal it,
if I knew it was a bomb?

1731
02:24:24,466 --> 02:24:26,246
That baldy, Pinki is
responsible for all this.

1732
02:24:26,336 --> 02:24:27,959
But the cops think we're involved.

1733
02:24:28,807 --> 02:24:31,619
But why is Pinki doing this?

1734
02:24:31,709 --> 02:24:32,625
What do you mean?

1735
02:24:33,409 --> 02:24:34,952
I mean Pinki...

1736
02:24:35,042 --> 02:24:37,293
What about the bomb?

1737
02:24:37,810 --> 02:24:39,452
Just forget about them.

1738
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:40,952
Think of our safety first.

1739
02:24:41,327 --> 02:24:43,189
We can think about them at leisure.

1740
02:24:43,312 --> 02:24:44,834
Will all the
people in the city die?

1741
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:46,489
It's a neutron bomb,

1742
02:24:47,328 --> 02:24:48,635
no one will survive.

1743
02:24:49,774 --> 02:24:51,495
Can't we do anything?

1744
02:24:52,870 --> 02:24:54,451
I think, we must do something.

1745
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:55,977
I was thinking the same.

1746
02:24:56,981 --> 02:24:59,203
We've got to do something.
- But Nandu, what can we do?

1747
02:24:59,385 --> 02:25:00,537
What do you think?

1748
02:25:01,661 --> 02:25:03,099
We can talk to the police.

1749
02:25:03,189 --> 02:25:04,754
Yes, you're right. Let's go.

1750
02:25:05,162 --> 02:25:07,495
We've always
fought against the police

1751
02:25:08,190 --> 02:25:11,370
and now you want to
turn in our friends?

1752
02:25:11,643 --> 02:25:12,870
What do you want?

1753
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:15,338
Should we let them kill,
thousands of innocent people?

1754
02:25:16,287 --> 02:25:17,612
Is this what we set out to do?

1755
02:25:18,703 --> 02:25:20,233
You'll never
understand this man, Pinki.

1756
02:25:21,245 --> 02:25:22,307
He has gone mad.

1757
02:25:23,579 --> 02:25:25,359
He will die and get us killed too.

1758
02:25:27,036 --> 02:25:29,522
Suvarna,
we're left with only one option.

1759
02:25:30,453 --> 02:25:32,478
We must inform the
police immediately.

1760
02:25:35,401 --> 02:25:36,579
Police here.

1761
02:25:41,660 --> 02:25:44,447
Tarzan, go and catch him.

1762
02:25:44,537 --> 02:25:45,786
Hurry.

1763
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:47,995
Who were those two?
- Who are you talking about?

1764
02:25:48,203 --> 02:25:50,780
I'll break your legs,
if you don't answer.

1765
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:55,749
Even if you kill me, I won't
tell you, they were your boss.

1766
02:25:56,203 --> 02:25:57,203
My boss?

1767
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:01,078
Yes, your boss.

1768
02:26:02,036 --> 02:26:03,911
Intelligence officer.

1769
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:06,412
Intelligence officer.?

1770
02:26:06,911 --> 02:26:07,828
Yes.

1771
02:26:07,995 --> 02:26:09,203
Stay where you are!

1772
02:26:10,495 --> 02:26:13,661
So what were those officers
doing in the forest?

1773
02:26:14,245 --> 02:26:17,287
They were on a tiger hunt.
- A tiger hunt?

1774
02:26:17,377 --> 02:26:18,870
Yes.
- Go ahead.

1775
02:26:19,181 --> 02:26:20,328
Behind
- Go ahead.

1776
02:26:20,418 --> 02:26:22,078
Behind.
- What happened next?

1777
02:26:22,203 --> 02:26:23,828
The tiger was
running ahead of them.

1778
02:26:24,703 --> 02:26:26,412
The tiger was
running ahead of them?

1779
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:28,579
What happened after that?

1780
02:26:28,786 --> 02:26:30,381
Both of them
were chasing the tiger.

1781
02:26:30,471 --> 02:26:31,945
But what were they
doing in the forest?

1782
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:34,660
They were searching?
- Searching?

1783
02:26:34,828 --> 02:26:39,162
That lady officer's father,
is a very great hunter.

1784
02:26:39,470 --> 02:26:41,306
A very great hunter?
- And the other officer...

1785
02:26:41,453 --> 02:26:45,078
Yes.
- His mother is a very great hunter.

1786
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:49,758
Even my father was a great hunter.

1787
02:26:57,175 --> 02:26:58,453
Sir is here.

1788
02:26:58,543 --> 02:26:59,537
Sir.

1789
02:27:00,995 --> 02:27:02,162
He's mad.
- What?

1790
02:27:02,579 --> 02:27:03,953
He's absolutely crazy.

1791
02:27:04,370 --> 02:27:07,189
If he stays here for some
more time, he'll drive us crazy.

1792
02:27:08,203 --> 02:27:09,583
Just let him go.

1793
02:27:11,254 --> 02:27:11,993
Shree.
- Yes.

1794
02:27:12,083 --> 02:27:13,381
I think,
Mr Nair is the mad one.

1795
02:27:13,537 --> 02:27:17,120
That day,
when we followed that couple,

1796
02:27:17,370 --> 02:27:19,287
I told him
they were going towards the city.

1797
02:27:19,412 --> 02:27:21,287
You said,
they had gone towards the hills.

1798
02:27:21,412 --> 02:27:24,036
Yet, he asked you to take the road,
while I was sent towards the hills.

1799
02:27:24,162 --> 02:27:26,988
Since that day, I think
he has gone mad. - I agree.

1800
02:27:27,078 --> 02:27:29,995
He behaves like a mad man.
- Shree, tell me one thing.

1801
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:34,120
It's possible, he's not mad,
he's only pretending to be mad.

1802
02:27:34,287 --> 02:27:36,328
It's quite likely
that if we let him go...

1803
02:27:37,287 --> 02:27:38,495
Listen.
- Sir.

1804
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:41,287
You change into plain
clothes and follow him.

1805
02:28:19,208 --> 02:28:20,000
Catch him.

1806
02:28:20,163 --> 02:28:21,292
Stop!

1807
02:28:21,583 --> 02:28:23,125
Please!

1808
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:25,958
Let's go!

1809
02:28:33,081 --> 02:28:34,875
Who shot you? Who are you?

1810
02:28:35,113 --> 02:28:37,184
Who are you?
- I...

1811
02:28:45,250 --> 02:28:46,951
Pinki run! The police is here.
- What happened?

1812
02:28:47,041 --> 02:28:48,553
Let's run.

1813
02:29:05,181 --> 02:29:06,958
Look, they got
onto that double-decker bus.

1814
02:29:07,413 --> 02:29:09,083
Turn to your right. Hurry.

1815
02:29:11,537 --> 02:29:12,625
Move your silly vehicle.

1816
02:29:13,898 --> 02:29:14,900
Ticket!

1817
02:29:17,334 --> 02:29:18,285
Sir, ticket.

1818
02:29:18,791 --> 02:29:19,806
I don't want.

1819
02:29:21,833 --> 02:29:25,081
Please pay for the ticket.
- I don't want a ticket.

1820
02:29:25,917 --> 02:29:27,091
I said, pay up.

1821
02:29:27,822 --> 02:29:30,538
Why should I pay?
I don't want the ticket.

1822
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:33,494
Is he mad?

1823
02:29:36,764 --> 02:29:37,935
Nobody moves.

1824
02:29:38,215 --> 02:29:40,333
I said no one moves.

1825
02:29:41,041 --> 02:29:43,237
If anyone moves,

1826
02:29:43,405 --> 02:29:45,524
I'll throw him
out of the bus like him.

1827
02:29:45,796 --> 02:29:47,033
Do you get it?

1828
02:30:11,230 --> 02:30:12,035
Oh god!

1829
02:30:12,125 --> 02:30:13,083
Sit down, nobody moves.

1830
02:30:13,173 --> 02:30:15,216
I say, sit down everybody.

1831
02:30:15,666 --> 02:30:16,458
You keep driving.

1832
02:30:16,548 --> 02:30:18,568
Sir...
- Keep driving or I'll shoot you.

1833
02:30:19,086 --> 02:30:20,416
Keep driving.

1834
02:30:25,019 --> 02:30:29,385
I too am a citizen of this country,
like you.

1835
02:30:30,045 --> 02:30:31,666
There's no need to be afraid of me.

1836
02:30:31,756 --> 02:30:33,208
Let's go to Delhi.

1837
02:30:34,541 --> 02:30:37,583
Let's sing, dance and enjoy.

1838
02:30:40,175 --> 02:30:43,708
Why don't we play
the game of melodies?

1839
02:30:43,833 --> 02:30:45,875
Tarzan, you may begin.

1840
02:30:46,262 --> 02:30:48,416
No, I'll begin the game.

1841
02:30:50,296 --> 02:30:54,833
"Oh my love, don't leave me"

1842
02:30:55,410 --> 02:30:57,917
"Please don't leave me,
my beloved"

1843
02:30:58,056 --> 02:31:00,930
Sing a song starting
with the alphabet 'd'.

1844
02:31:03,405 --> 02:31:04,875
Sing.

1845
02:31:06,159 --> 02:31:08,877
"Don't say a word"

1846
02:31:09,415 --> 02:31:12,451
"Please don't say anything"
- Sing.

1847
02:31:12,541 --> 02:31:15,273
"Don't speak a word"
- Sing along.

1848
02:31:15,585 --> 02:31:18,334
"Please don't say anything"

1849
02:31:18,833 --> 02:31:21,708
"What do we have to say?"

1850
02:31:22,174 --> 02:31:25,000
"There is nothing I need to hear"

1851
02:31:44,219 --> 02:31:45,541
Look for them.

1852
02:31:49,767 --> 02:31:53,025
Tarzan, are you looking for them
or counting the tyres of the bus?

1853
02:31:55,232 --> 02:31:57,827
Search for them quickly or
I'll send you back to the forest.

1854
02:31:57,917 --> 02:32:00,152
Joseph, you drive the bus.
- Pinki, this is a double-decker.

1855
02:32:00,242 --> 02:32:01,064
I said, drive it.

1856
02:32:01,154 --> 02:32:03,535
But I've never driven a
a double-decker bus before.

1857
02:32:03,625 --> 02:32:05,359
Fool,
drive it like a three-wheeler.

1858
02:32:05,499 --> 02:32:07,240
But how do I start it?

1859
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:17,208
Daya Shankar!

1860
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:20,583
Auto!

1861
02:32:56,710 --> 02:32:58,000
Don't worry,

1862
02:32:58,176 --> 02:33:01,020
I don't touch
someone else's girlfriend.

1863
02:33:01,818 --> 02:33:04,524
Besides,
I do know about your love story.

1864
02:33:05,208 --> 02:33:06,258
Hey!

1865
02:33:07,278 --> 02:33:08,779
Do you want to hug your lover?

1866
02:33:09,312 --> 02:33:11,167
Go, come on move.

1867
02:33:11,899 --> 02:33:14,375
She's coming,
have patience darling.

1868
02:33:15,965 --> 02:33:18,372
You make a good couple.

1869
02:33:18,928 --> 02:33:21,140
I was telling Tarzan,

1870
02:33:21,530 --> 02:33:24,568
one must be
willing to die for love.

1871
02:33:25,684 --> 02:33:29,022
So tell me, are you ready
to die or should I kill you?

1872
02:33:30,195 --> 02:33:31,329
Ah!

1873
02:33:31,419 --> 02:33:32,625
Nandu!

1874
02:33:43,995 --> 02:33:46,083
Pinki, are you alive?

1875
02:33:46,329 --> 02:33:50,125
You keep driving, I'll handle this.

1876
02:33:50,795 --> 02:33:52,458
Rascal!
- Hit him!

1877
02:33:52,791 --> 02:33:55,004
Pinki!
- You keep driving!

1878
02:33:56,042 --> 02:33:57,625
Why don't you understand?

1879
02:33:58,125 --> 02:34:00,125
I'll handle this.

1880
02:34:02,334 --> 02:34:03,416
Tarzan.

1881
02:34:04,898 --> 02:34:07,428
Hey, Pinki! Pinki!

1882
02:34:27,535 --> 02:34:29,053
Don't move.
- Bhawani.

1883
02:34:30,277 --> 02:34:32,905
Don't move,
- Nandu.

1884
02:34:33,147 --> 02:34:34,641
Don't move!
- Pinki!

1885
02:34:34,731 --> 02:34:36,075
Pinki!

1886
02:34:36,436 --> 02:34:37,899
Nandu, are you okay?

1887
02:34:37,989 --> 02:34:41,747
Drive faster.

1888
02:34:57,673 --> 02:35:00,250
Pinki, what happened to Tarzan?

1889
02:35:00,916 --> 02:35:02,817
Pinki!

1890
02:35:13,322 --> 02:35:14,238
Don't move.

1891
02:35:14,364 --> 02:35:16,773
Were you driving a bus or a cart?

1892
02:35:16,863 --> 02:35:18,857
That car was speeding
and I lost control.

1893
02:35:18,947 --> 02:35:21,113
Are you blind?
You couldn't see the bridge!

1894
02:35:21,322 --> 02:35:22,863
I forgot
this was a double-decker bus.

1895
02:35:22,953 --> 02:35:24,529
Lord!

1896
02:35:25,197 --> 02:35:29,072
If I have more people like you
in my gang, I'll never be a don.

1897
02:35:29,238 --> 02:35:32,280
I want to be a famous don,
do you get me?

1898
02:35:53,341 --> 02:35:56,885
Don't move, or I'll shoot you.
Wait there.

1899
02:35:59,321 --> 02:36:03,031
Don't come to this side.
Stay there, I'll come that way.

1900
02:36:03,405 --> 02:36:05,698
Joseph, my friend,

1901
02:36:06,197 --> 02:36:08,530
don't be afraid.
Just hold your breath.

1902
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:11,998
I'll handle everything.
Just hold your breath.

1903
02:36:12,571 --> 02:36:13,529
Stop!

1904
02:36:19,113 --> 02:36:20,015
Bhawani,

1905
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:23,831
if this rascal comes here,
he'll kill both of us.

1906
02:36:24,821 --> 02:36:28,991
Our intention was to
stop him at any cost,

1907
02:36:29,738 --> 02:36:31,535
even if that meant
sacrificing our lives.

1908
02:36:34,072 --> 02:36:35,571
Are you willing to co-operate?

1909
02:36:40,307 --> 02:36:41,445
I love you.

1910
02:36:43,962 --> 02:36:45,000
Me too.

1911
02:36:59,447 --> 02:37:00,940
I beg of you,

1912
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:05,429
don't come this side, please.

1913
02:37:05,573 --> 02:37:07,529
I request you, stay away.

1914
02:37:22,155 --> 02:37:23,107
Rascals!

1915
02:37:23,197 --> 02:37:25,238
Glory to Mother India!

1916
02:38:16,372 --> 02:38:18,782
Rana, what I don't understand is,

1917
02:38:18,872 --> 02:38:21,761
why did they lie to us that the box
contained gold worth Rs 20 million?

1918
02:38:21,851 --> 02:38:24,998
It was actually worth Rs 20 million.

1919
02:38:25,163 --> 02:38:27,848
No, it was worth Rs 10 million.
- No, it was worth Rs 20 million.

1920
02:38:27,938 --> 02:38:29,491
But they said 10 million.

1921
02:38:29,581 --> 02:38:30,581
Sir...

1922
02:38:30,914 --> 02:38:32,622
It's very simple.

1923
02:38:33,455 --> 02:38:35,157
Nandu was told
it had gold worth Rs 20 million.

1924
02:38:35,247 --> 02:38:37,866
Sir, I was telling him just that...
- I know, that's what...

1925
02:38:37,956 --> 02:38:39,039
Shut up!

1926
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:42,240
Nandu was informed it
contained gold worth Rs 20 million,

1927
02:38:42,330 --> 02:38:45,039
but Nandu himself didn't know,

1928
02:38:45,247 --> 02:38:48,758
that the box contained
a neutron bomb and not gold.

1929
02:38:48,956 --> 02:38:51,831
Sir, please take this.

1930
02:38:52,831 --> 02:38:53,831
Take this.

1931
02:38:55,079 --> 02:38:56,122
It's the bomb.

1932
02:38:56,857 --> 02:38:59,449
Please, forgive me.

1933
02:38:59,956 --> 02:39:01,990
I really troubled you
during interrogation,

1934
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:03,853
with the stories of the tiger hunt.

1935
02:39:04,289 --> 02:39:07,643
After all, we were only
trying to save our country.

1936
02:39:07,956 --> 02:39:09,182
Please don't mind.

1937
02:39:09,747 --> 02:39:10,974
Glory to India.

1938
02:39:14,455 --> 02:39:16,389
Try to understand,

1939
02:39:17,122 --> 02:39:18,664
Nandu too wasn't aware that...

1940
02:39:18,914 --> 02:39:21,512
I'm glad that the
inspector believed us.

1941
02:39:22,122 --> 02:39:25,034
Otherwise,
we would've been in great trouble.

1942
02:39:26,247 --> 02:39:29,647
Finally, it's all over!

1943
02:39:30,455 --> 02:39:32,355
I have a request to make,

1944
02:39:32,664 --> 02:39:34,202
after you're married,

1945
02:39:34,622 --> 02:39:38,264
you can go to Manali or Mussoorie

1946
02:39:38,706 --> 02:39:40,079
for your honeymoon.

1947
02:39:40,247 --> 02:39:41,864
But please
don't come to my village.

1948
02:39:42,163 --> 02:39:42,998
Why?

1949
02:39:44,247 --> 02:39:45,664
I was only joking.

1950
02:39:45,872 --> 02:39:49,622
Come to my village
for your honeymoon.

1951
02:39:49,789 --> 02:39:50,956
Bye, Daya Shankar.

1952
02:39:51,122 --> 02:39:54,561
Mr Chako,
I told you, my name is Bhawani.

1953
02:39:54,747 --> 02:39:57,609
I shall always
remember you as, Daya Shankar.

1954
02:39:58,079 --> 02:39:59,722
Bye.
- Bye.

1955
02:40:00,372 --> 02:40:01,354
Bye.
- Bye.

1956
02:40:01,444 --> 02:40:02,466
Bye.
- Bye.

1957
02:40:10,664 --> 02:40:12,205
Bhawani
- Yes.

1958
02:40:12,414 --> 02:40:15,032
Now that
we have decided to get married,

1959
02:40:15,122 --> 02:40:17,622
why don't you tell me who you are?

1960
02:40:17,872 --> 02:40:19,581
Who are your parents?
Where do you live?

1961
02:40:19,956 --> 02:40:21,706
Nandu, let's do it like this.

1962
02:40:22,079 --> 02:40:24,820
First, you tell me
and then I'll tell you.

1963
02:40:25,308 --> 02:40:26,238
Hey!

1964
02:40:26,916 --> 02:40:28,032
Why should I tell you?

1965
02:40:28,122 --> 02:40:29,616
I asked you first.
- Yes, I agree.

1966
02:40:29,706 --> 02:40:31,079
But now, I'm asking you.

1967
02:40:31,539 --> 02:40:33,122
But I was the first one to ask.

1968
02:40:33,372 --> 02:40:35,956
But since I'm asking you now,
you should answer first.

1969
02:40:36,372 --> 02:40:38,115
Why do you always have it your way?

1970
02:40:38,205 --> 02:40:41,782
Nandu, I'm warning you,
it'll always be that way.

1971
02:40:41,872 --> 02:40:43,289
Even after we're
married, understand?

1972
02:40:43,497 --> 02:40:44,539
Is that so?
- Yes.

1973
02:40:44,664 --> 02:40:45,747
Now come on tell me.

1974
02:40:45,998 --> 02:40:47,282
Is that so?
- Of course.

1975
02:40:47,372 --> 02:40:49,747
You're always fighting with me,
I'm leaving.

1976
02:40:49,837 --> 02:40:50,784
Hey!

1977
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:53,539
All right,
sometimes you may have it your way.

1978
02:40:53,629 --> 02:40:54,789
That's better.

1979
02:40:54,956 --> 02:40:56,604
Should I begin?

1980
02:40:57,090 --> 02:40:58,956
Tell me.
- Okay then, here it comes.

1981
02:41:00,247 --> 02:41:03,747
Look, when I was a kid,
I mean really small.

1982
02:41:04,079 --> 02:41:07,039
My father was a great hunter!

1983
02:42:07,789 --> 02:42:11,872
"Everyone is restless"

1984
02:42:12,914 --> 02:42:16,372
"Everyone is restless"

1985
02:42:20,581 --> 02:42:24,122
"Everyone is restless"

1986
02:43:06,747 --> 02:43:10,289
"Everyone is restless"

1987
02:43:11,831 --> 02:43:15,664
"Everyone is restless"

1988
02:43:16,998 --> 02:43:20,622
"Everyone is restless"

1989
02:43:22,122 --> 02:43:25,581
"Everyone is restless"

1990
02:43:27,205 --> 02:43:30,747
"Everyone is restless"

1991
02:43:32,372 --> 02:43:35,497
"Everyone is restless"

1992
02:43:37,497 --> 02:43:41,205
"Everyone is restless"
