1
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,205
Smack it with the tip of your
finger instead of your nail.

2
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,202
Samih.

3
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,401
Samih, I'm Tarek.

4
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,802
I have come to
offer my condolence

5
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,539
for your brother's martyrdom.

6
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,142
His gift has brought him
riches that only heaven knows,

7
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,645
and his name will be
among those regarded.

8
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:22,049
When our word is the
one and the whole world follows.

9
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,569
He's your responsibility
now, Samih.

10
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,096
Your name?

11
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:03,931
Samih.

12
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,733
Mukhtar.

13
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,202
Is your family dead?

14
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,845
There was a wedding
party for my sister.

15
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:22,916
The men were shooting bullets
into the air in celebrations.

16
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,921
The Americans thought they
were being fired on and hit us.

17
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,558
Your sister?

18
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,898
Gone.

19
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,618
One of the men says he
was hit by a shrapnel.

20
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,154
Crazy guy.

21
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,456
His family had no use for him.

22
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,229
Your brother would
have been so proud.

23
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,802
This is what your father brought
you back from America for.

24
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,403
A true Muslim.

25
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,008
Your brother is a hero.

26
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,109
They called him a coward.

27
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,911
They twist things around.

28
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,815
They call us terrorists, and
they drop bombs on innocents.

29
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,682
Your brother died a hero.

30
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:34,187
He stood there, proud,
praised Allah, and martyred himself.

31
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,823
That's not what they said.

32
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,457
Samih, the only way
to hurt your enemy

33
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,859
is to make them appear weak.

34
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,361
It is a tactic of the desperate.

35
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,865
And they are desperate now
because they know there is

36
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,668
an army stronger than they are.

37
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,203
Army of Allah.

38
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,940
And you are now
part of that army.

39
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,475
Consider me your older brother.

40
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,878
That's why I'm
telling you to sleep.

41
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,014
And you'll see-- tomorrow
will be a new beginning.

42
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,804
Hey, Samih.

43
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,141
Isn't this how your
mother keeps you fed?

44
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,090
Samih.

45
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,029
It is of our obedience
to Allah.

46
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,199
That has kept us from
falling under the guise

47
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,900
of the infidels.

48
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:47,907
And prayer keeps us centered and
focused, that we do not stray.

49
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,611
This is the only reason
they will never break us.

50
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,780
Allah will answer our prayers.

51
00:17:55,608 --> 00:18:02,182
To Allah we truly belong
and to Allah we return.

52
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,952
Do you see what they have
done to your brothers,

53
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,488
sisters, fathers, mothers?

54
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,260
Do you understand
now why we fight?

55
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:19,932
They do this and tell us
it is for our own good.

56
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,502
From far off in the
sky, the Zionists fire

57
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,205
weapons only they possess.

58
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,375
They tell their sons
that they are brave.

59
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,644
What bravery is there
in being our of range?

60
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,717
Bravery comes from looking
your enemy in the eye,

61
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,020
as close as we are now.

62
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,056
We must bring the fight to them.

63
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,294
Otherwise, they will keep with these cowardly offense.

64
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,063
We must take their oppression off our brothers and sisters

65
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,365
and turn it on them!

66
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,070
Right their wrong.

67
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,874
You are the chosen
people, not them.

68
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,213
Allah teaches us that
every child is born perfect

69
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,615
because it is born
to the perfect faith.

70
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,649
Islam.

71
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,321
But its parents convert it,
divert it, make it imperfect.

72
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,227
Your elders won't tell
you this, but children

73
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,362
are stronger than we are.

74
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,097
In the midst of your
parents over-protection,

75
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,367
did you not become more bored?

76
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,238
In their sorrows, did you
not become more resolute?

77
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,340
More sure of yourself?

78
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:37,777
They won't tell you this, but
you have become the leader

79
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,746
and not the follower.

80
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,516
You have become the
protector-- the protectors

81
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,185
of all of true Islam.

82
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,622
The very thing the
oppressors fear most

83
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:55,562
is sitting before me right
now-- the children of Islam.

84
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,300
And with you, we will do to
them what they have done to us.

85
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,104
You are the future!

86
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,408
And the future
offered to the martyr

87
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,377
is the greatest one of all.

88
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,197
Samih.

89
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,371
It's come for you.

90
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,406
It's old, but still it's good.

91
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:51,310
A few pieces missing, but I
have ordered some new ones.

92
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,679
Thank you.

93
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,214
You've done very well.

94
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:00,152
Saba Khan is so pleased and
has requested you to see him.

95
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,354
He wants to see me?

96
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:02,522
Yes.

97
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,899
Samih, it's time.

98
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,311
Hey, Samih.

99
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,715
I'm sorry.

100
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,752
I'm really sorry.

101
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:09,321
You want to really
impress Saba Khan?

102
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,723
OK.

103
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,260
Then after saying salaam,
just say...

104
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,099
He will be pleased.

105
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,167
Trust me.

106
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,001
OK?

107
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,570
Go.

108
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,274
Come, Samih.

109
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,681
Do you know why you
have been brought here?

110
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,951
Your father, in his
wisdom, returning you back

111
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,221
in his homeland, gave our cause
not only one freedom fighter

112
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,523
but two.

113
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,158
His passing so soon was a loss.

114
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,796
He must be beaming proudly from
paradise looking at his son.

115
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,699
Your brother too, of course.

116
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,536
Thank you.

117
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,405
You don't have to
thank me for the truth.

118
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,342
It is what we adults
owe to our children.

119
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,811
It is what we have to
relearn from the children

120
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,046
as we get older.

121
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,816
Would you like me
to do something?

122
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,361
You can do a lot where your
brethren are concerned.

123
00:24:56,596 --> 00:25:01,000
The Zionists and Americans
need to learn the truth.

124
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,672
And who better than one of
their own to teach them?

125
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,674
Will you work hard for
a mission I give you?

126
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,175
Yes.

127
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,344
Good.

128
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,380
Hmm.

129
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,853
Oh, Samih.

130
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,191
Where did you get that
remarkable greeting?

131
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,583
Why did you tell
me to say that?

132
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,652
Shut up!

133
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,089
Shut up.

134
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,801
Shouldn't you be washing
Saba Khan's feet, American?

135
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,002
Huh?

136
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,239
Get up.

137
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:21,908
Stop.

138
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:22,742
Hey.

139
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:24,677
Get up.

140
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:25,812
I don't want to fight you.

141
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,379
Come on.

142
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,881
Come on.

143
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:30,482
Stop.

144
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,834
Bloody Americans.

145
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,584
Go, Rashid.

146
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,225
Rashid, you can't do that.

147
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,194
You have to flick it.

148
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:18,097
Samih.

149
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,431
Go and find Mukhtar.

150
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,067
We have to go.

151
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,402
Yushua, Rashid--

152
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,357
We have to go.

153
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,059
Tarek is calling us.

154
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,127
I'm coming, American.

155
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,014
Hey, guys.

156
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,082
I need to grab something cold.

157
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,449
- You want something?
- No.

158
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,184
Hey, hurry.

159
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,318
We've got to get back.

160
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,387
I've got to Skype my girl.

161
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,221
That sounds dirty.

162
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,389
Yeah.

163
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,823
She likes it when I
Skype her all night long.

164
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:25,657
Nice.

165
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,497
Do you have any Coke?

166
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,900
Hey.

167
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,167
Coke.

168
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,202
Tssht.

169
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,793
Samih.

170
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,297
What is it?

171
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:10,202
The complete set of pieces,
professional weight and size.

172
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,704
Wow.

173
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,206
Thank you.

174
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,874
We keep our promises.

175
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,476
Right?

176
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,155
Hey.

177
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:30,289
No Coke.

178
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,123
Yeah, I already heard that.

179
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,258
Who-- who are your friends?

180
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,125
Fuck it.

181
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:33,859
What?

182
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,593
Fuck it.

183
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,828
Uh, I think you mean fuck off.

184
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,164
Fuck it.

185
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,734
Hey, guys.

186
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,872
Can we take a ride out west?

187
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,207
This time of night?

188
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,141
Yeah, I think I
heard something.

189
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,343
Uh, are there reports
of Muslim-Americans

190
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,012
bringing their families
out to this area?

191
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,180
Muslims do stupid things.

192
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,147
That's why we're here.

193
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,415
That's not what I mean.

194
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,350
Remember the bombing
in Hyderabad last year?

195
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,352
There were rumors the
kid was an American.

196
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,853
Look, man, we got to get back.

197
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,123
You can't see shit in the
dark this time of night.

198
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,092
We'll talk about it on the way.

199
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:13,265
I don't
know about you guys,

200
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,866
but I could sure use a blow job.

201
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,602
Yeah, the only way
you're getting your dick sucked

202
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,137
out here is if it
gets bit by a cobra

203
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,272
and Taylor here decides
to suck the venom out.

204
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,708
They went in this direction.

205
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,043
What-- what's up ahead?

206
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,145
Uh, there's just a couple
warlords up in those hills.

207
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,946
Other than that, it's
just a bunch of dirt,

208
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:31,117
some abandoned houses,
maybe a couple cockroaches.

209
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,851
Cockroaches?

210
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,653
Sand niggers.

211
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,488
Trying to be
politically correct here.

212
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,358
Call them cockroaches because
they can survive anything.

213
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,293
Sounds more like a
compliment than a put-down.

214
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,561
Yeah, it's not meant to be.

215
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:43,862
Cockroaches are still bugs.

216
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,564
And you know what
we do with bugs?

217
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,066
Squash 'em.

218
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,467
You know what I don't get?

219
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,569
They keep promising
these bombers 72

220
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,039
virgins to blow themselves up.

221
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,374
It's actually a misnomer.

222
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,742
It isn't virgins.

223
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:57,643
It's wives.

224
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:58,677
Yeah, that's even worse.

225
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,079
Imagine the alimony.

226
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,451
My point is, 72 virgins, wives,
whatever-- that equals 72 kids to look over potentially.

227
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,019
Wouldn't one of these
bombers actually

228
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,587
think through the consequences?

229
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,556
Or at least get a
vasectomy before blowing

230
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,658
themselves up to smithereens?

231
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,093
Seriously, guys,
how are you going

232
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,495
to support all those brats
on a suicide bomber's salary?

233
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,531
I mean, you don't get
paid once, don't you?

234
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,033
72 wives?

235
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,001
That'd last me,
what, three days?

236
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,071
What am I supposed to do
for the rest of eternity?

237
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,073
Yeah, well, the
least paradise could

238
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,708
offer you is endless variety.

239
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,778
So, Stevie, what exactly are
you hoping to find out here?

240
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,214
You know I can't take this
Pakistani piece of shit outside

241
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,448
of the perimeter.

242
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,517
Just a story beyond
the usually embedded

243
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,951
journalists getting
soldier's takes

244
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,453
on virgins in paradise, buddy.

245
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,922
Oh, you know our mother's
love those kinds of stories.

246
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,493
Get down!
Get down!

247
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,360
Oh, fuck.

248
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,361
Fuck.

249
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:51,797
Get down!

250
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,703
Under enemy fire.

251
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,272
Coordinates, latitude--

252
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,141
Oh, fuck.

253
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,111
Jesus.

254
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,078
Fuck.

255
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,419
Holy fuck!

256
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,954
Please, you got-- I promise,
you got the wrong guy!

257
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:23,989
Please!

258
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:24,823
Please!

259
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,024
Please, I didn't do anything!

260
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,958
Please!

261
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,127
Please, no!

262
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:30,562
Oh, no!

263
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,030
No, please!

264
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,499
No, no, no, no!

265
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:37,763
We weren't spying.

266
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:41,300
We were just looking for a place
to buy a Coke, and we got lost.

267
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,803
American, you don't see the
infiltration of something

268
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:47,906
as ordinary as that as a
slap against our people?

269
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,279
We need tough leaders

270
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,615
and strong morals to survive.

271
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,586
Not a soft set.

272
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,890
You follow it.

273
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,058
Ask your Russian friends.

274
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,227
We never asked for this war.

275
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,467
But the math
proves different.

276
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:22,408
America has been in one war
or another every generation.

277
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:25,744
You obviously are not
a religion of peace.

278
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,013
But what are you?

279
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,981
A nation of warmongers?

280
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,585
No one is innocent.

281
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,288
Injustice has been
made by both sides.

282
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,460
You murder our
people by the score

283
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,796
and you want us
to bend your way.

284
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,601
How can a father who has
lost his entire family

285
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,303
side with you?

286
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,641
How is my piety equal
to your gratuity?

287
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,511
There has to be an
end, a reconciliation.

288
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,148
Surely a man of your wealth and
education could influence this.

289
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,984
Don't assume what you
have not lived, American.

290
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,856
And don't try to compare
me with puppets who would

291
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,958
sell their people for silver!

292
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,961
I've spent my coin
for a better cost.

293
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,796
And yet you revel
in your position.

294
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,999
And you use yours to
spread your falsehood.

295
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,170
It's not my intention
to argue with you.

296
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,074
I know that my government
has done grievous things.

297
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,309
I'm just looking
for an interview.

298
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:35,914
I thought you were
looking for a Coke.

299
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:40,719
Yes, and an interview
with an American boy.

300
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:48,994
What American boy?

301
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:54,733
I thought I heard a voice
the other day at a shop.

302
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,868
It sounded like a westerner.

303
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,774
There is no American boy here.

304
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,012
Then I've been mistaken.

305
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,716
I'm a journalist.

306
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,019
I could be of more use to you.

307
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,623
If you wish, let me tell
your side of things.

308
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,257
Let me interview you.

309
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,894
What I wish is for
your dogs of war

310
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,464
to leave my people in peace.

311
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,970
How are you you, my old friend?

312
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,475
I have had better days.

313
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,277
As have we all.

314
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,080
I've arranged a
better doctor for you.

315
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,518
Well, the last one said a
walk in the morning would help.

316
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,286
But it hasn't.

317
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,923
Still, here I am.

318
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,192
You want to go back?

319
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:31,429
Forward is always better,
especially at this age.

320
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,766
I know you already know that.

321
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,002
How do you know that?

322
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,204
You've never looked
any other way.

323
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,173
I know you're ambition.

324
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:44,309
Don't think I don't.

325
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,779
The journalist--

326
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,848
--Misbah will
take care of him.

327
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,617
Is that wise of her?

328
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:53,652
Is there any alternative?

329
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,154
There's only the
inevitable--

330
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,657
how far along
is the American boy?

331
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,793
It will take time.

332
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,496
Are you suggesting something?

333
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,801
Send the boy to me.

334
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,804
Let us see what he's made of.

335
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,074
Come, Rashid.

336
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,778
Come, come.

337
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:53,945
Shh.

338
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:54,846
Silence!

339
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,752
Come, come, come, come.

340
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:03,555
Come.

341
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,800
Come on, Samih.

342
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:15,934
Sit here.

343
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:16,935
You talking to me now?

344
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,103
He can't hold both of us.

345
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:20,038
Oh, sure he can.

346
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:23,809
Come on.

347
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,880
I want you to see what
they do with Americans.

348
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,568
My name is Steve Winthrop.

349
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,070
I'm an American journalist.

350
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,640
I was spying when
I was captured.

351
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,076
My honorable captors demand
the immediate release

352
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:02,180
of all Palestinian prisoners
from Israeli jails,

353
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,016
all Islamic brothers from
imperialist prisons--

354
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,484
We should get out of here.

355
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,986
Ah, just wait.

356
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:09,921
Maybe they'll kill him.

357
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,357
If these demands are
not met within 24 hours,

358
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,960
my honorable captors
will have no other choice

359
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,995
but to kill me for
the sins committed

360
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,997
against Islam and its people.

361
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,296
Samih, you come with me.

362
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:03,241
Samih, I have a
favor to ask of you.

363
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,744
Anything you wish, Kamil Khan.

364
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,212
Good boy.

365
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,982
Often, obedience
is lost on youth.

366
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,552
But even the Americans couldn't
deprive you of the wisdom

367
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,654
your father gave to you.

368
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,725
The American spy journalist?

369
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,693
You wish I talk to him?

370
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,762
Such a smart boy.

371
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,165
That is why children
rule the world.

372
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:30,201
When would you like
me to talk to him?

373
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,572
The prophet teaches us
that it is great treachery

374
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,343
to tell your brother
something he accepts as truth

375
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:40,912
but that you know is a lie.

376
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,682
Yet that is what
these Americans do.

377
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:49,354
And this spy journalist uses
words in treacherous ways.

378
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:55,727
Saba Khan says you have
progressed well, Samih,

379
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,730
but I'm not sure you are ready.

380
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:01,299
I will not let you
down, Kamil Khan.

381
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:09,374
When you please me,
know that Allah is pleased.

382
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,543
Go.

383
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:13,544
Set him right.

384
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:57,708
What is this?

385
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:05,050
So you wanted to speak with
the American boy, right?

386
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,651
This is him.

387
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:09,220
He will give you your interview.

388
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:18,663
You expect me to, uh,
write with my hands tied?

389
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:20,431
Nobody reads anymore.

390
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,100
We'll tape this.

391
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,003
What's your name?

392
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,471
Samih.

393
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,973
Samih.

394
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,808
Hi, Samih.
I'm Steve.

395
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,411
Your brother's the one
that bombed that school?

396
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,513
He was a hero.

397
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:39,617
No doubt,
one person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter, right?

398
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,121
He really buried the lead on his
American heritage, though, huh?

399
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,824
I guess the accent on the
tape he made didn't work.

400
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,994
Should have had better coaches.

401
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:52,297
So what, now you're here
to correct a mistake?

402
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,966
I wonder when they're going
to stop sending children

403
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,501
to do their dirty work.

404
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,169
Grown-ups send you
out to do this, too.

405
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,013
Do you have any other
family, just in case

406
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:09,547
you screw up your mission, too?

407
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,282
They're all dead.

408
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,821
No, they're not.

409
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:19,624
See, when you've been
doing my job for a while,

410
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,393
you get really good at
picking out who's lying.

411
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,829
My mother.

412
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,464
How much did she sell you for?

413
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:27,665
She didn't.

414
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,134
We take care of each other.

415
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:30,801
Is that why you're
here instead of home?

416
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:31,902
They're educating me.

417
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,038
Educating?

418
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:34,905
Is that what they call
brainwashing these days?

419
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,474
You were spying.

420
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:37,708
They caught you.

421
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,079
Whatever happens, you have
brought it upon yourself.

422
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:42,980
Is that how you really feel?

423
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,317
Or is this just the educated
martyr coming out in you?

424
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:49,987
I have no problem laying
my life down for the cause.

425
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,222
You're 12.

426
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,024
The only cause you
should be thinking about

427
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:55,993
is girls and what band you
want to form to get them.

428
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,963
Is that the choice you
give children of Palestine

429
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,998
before you drop
bombs on their heads?

430
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,901
Why do you want to kill people?

431
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,437
No Muslim wants to kill.

432
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:10,341
But when one is under attack,
one must defend oneself.

433
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,776
I'm not attacking you.

434
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,178
I write for a living.

435
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,416
One million Iraqis dead
from American attacks.

436
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,618
Do you write about them?

437
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,355
American justice is
only selective at best.

438
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,125
You say live and let live.

439
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:30,961
But you have made it
kill or be killed for us.

440
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:32,797
So why do you ask
us to be merciful?

441
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:34,899
You're just twisting
words, Samih.

442
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,767
I could show you a load
of people starting up

443
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,104
at the top of the Vatican
who do the exact same thing,

444
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:40,871
and that doesn't make
them right, either.

445
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,872
Then everybody's wrong.

446
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,374
They probably are.

447
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,643
So why don't we just admit
that we're all flawed

448
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,944
and try to get along?

449
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,713
Allah is not flawed.

450
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:50,281
I never said Allah was.

451
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,482
I said men.

452
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,219
And prepubescent boys
with death wishes, especially.

453
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,989
You're still an American, right?

454
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:00,891
I'm a Muslim first.

455
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:01,826
Yeah, well your
friends are trying

456
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,662
to sell you off as an American,
same way they did your brother.

457
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,564
I am a Muslim!

458
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,900
When you were an
American kid growing up

459
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,339
in America just two short years
ago, did you watch "Star Wars"?

460
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:15,506
What?

461
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:16,341
"Star Wars."

462
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:17,475
Did you watch it?

463
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:18,709
What does this have to do--

464
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,178
Did you know that
it's an allegory

465
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,313
between man and religion?

466
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,081
Faith is the force.

467
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:26,284
There are those
who use it for good

468
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,119
and those who use it for evil.

469
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:34,759
Luke sees black and
white, right and wrong.

470
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:39,164
But the problem is that
Darth Vader's his father.

471
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:42,533
And that complicates things.

472
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:43,868
He gets angry.

473
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,102
He leaves his training.

474
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:47,272
He wants to blow things up.

475
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,507
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say to you?

476
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,341
I don't.

477
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,876
Yes you do, Samih.

478
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:54,078
What they're doing to
me is wrong, Samih.

479
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,280
And you know this.

480
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,647
And what they're filling
your head in with

481
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,284
is darkness because you've
seen the other side.

482
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:01,986
Do no go down this path, Samih!

483
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,455
It is darkness, and
it will slowly eat--

484
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,624
Come on, Samih.

485
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,660
There's no discussing
things with them.

486
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,229
They only dictate.

487
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,231
They don't listen.

488
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,414
Steve?

489
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,248
Steve.

490
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:12,683
Samih?

491
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,752
Yeah, it's me.

492
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,422
Should get out of here, kid.

493
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:20,458
If you get caught, you're
gonna get in trouble.

494
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,427
You were screaming
this morning.

495
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:23,861
Yeah, losing a
couple fingernails

496
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,496
will do that to you.

497
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:33,037
When they let you go,
will you find my mother?

498
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,009
Yeah.

499
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:42,447
Tell her I'm all
right, not too worry.

500
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:44,181
Of course, Samih.

501
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,617
She always worries too much.

502
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,988
Yeah, mine too.

503
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:57,462
No girl ever loves you quite
like your mother, do they?

504
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,134
I never saw the
last "Star Wars."

505
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,337
I mean, the new ones.

506
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,574
I left before.

507
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,814
I'm-- I'm gonna go now.

508
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:21,719
Samih?

509
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,322
Yeah?

510
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,327
Take care of yourself.

511
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:12,036
Please, where are we going?

512
00:56:13,638 --> 00:56:14,905
What's going on?

513
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:19,644
Samih, please!

514
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:21,712
Are you there, Samih?

515
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:23,948
Please don't!

516
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:24,949
Oh, please!

517
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,183
Samih!

518
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,217
Samih, please!

519
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,953
Are you there, Samih?

520
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,589
Tell them they don't
have to do this, Samih!

521
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,268
No!

522
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,102
No!

523
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:49,239
No!

524
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,075
No!

525
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,310
Samih, please!

526
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,144
Please!

527
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,446
Please stay!

528
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,414
Please!

529
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:04,922
Please!

530
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,024
Samih, please!

531
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,025
Please!

532
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,527
Please, Samih!

533
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,470
Hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come.

534
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:02,212
Give us this day
our daily bread.

535
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,885
He's your
responsibility now.

536
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:49,726
You are the future!

537
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,229
Will you work hard
for a mission I give you?

538
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:56,200
Samih, I'm not
sure you're ready.

539
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,602
I will not let
you down, Kamil Khan.

540
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:00,504
Hey, Samih!

541
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:07,077
So Rashid is Yushua's
brother, huh?

542
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:13,217
I guess he had to take
the blame to protect the retard

543
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,885
But why?

544
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:18,188
I mean, the idiot.

545
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:24,962
It was you, wasn't it?

546
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,439
Save that anger for
your true enemy, Samih.

547
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:53,890
Zafar Khan?

548
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:01,598
Do you wish to say
something, Samih?

549
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,101
What is Allah's will for me?

550
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,235
I will do it.

551
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:53,943
Wake up, Samih!

552
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:55,079
Wake up!

553
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:57,214
Wake up, Samih!

554
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,348
Wake up!

555
01:06:59,183 --> 01:07:00,350
Wake up!

556
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,390
What were you dreaming about?

557
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:08,092
A well.

558
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,026
It was in my village.

559
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:13,397
I fell in it shortly
after we moved back.

560
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:17,267
If it hadn't been for my
brother--

561
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,369
he saved me.

562
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:31,047
What's your name?

563
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:31,948
Afsa.

564
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:32,782
Samih.

565
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:33,883
I know.

566
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,324
Come.

567
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:42,159
Sit down here.

568
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,562
Do you want to eat something?

569
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:46,763
Yes.

570
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:47,964
Afsa?

571
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,167
Bring something for him to eat.

572
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,344
Are you eating?

573
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:01,911
She will eat later.

574
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,447
You first.

575
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:09,353
We are doubly blessed to have
had two martyrs from one family

576
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:10,287
under our roof.

577
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:14,424
Your brother.

578
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:18,295
Afsa witnessed his
march into paradise.

579
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:20,430
He died heroically.

580
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:29,273
Excuse me.

581
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,188
There, across the street.

582
01:10:59,323 --> 01:11:01,691
That is the American consulate.

583
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,961
Zafar Khan has it
targeted in two days.

584
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,864
Usually on a weekday,
when it's working,

585
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:11,635
it's pretty crowded with
job-seekers, visa-seekers,

586
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,703
and even protesters.

587
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:17,206
You need to mingle in the
crowd, get to the gate,

588
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:20,677
and tell the guards that
you're an American citizen who

589
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,779
has lost his parents.

590
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,683
They should believe your accent.

591
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:30,354
And, uh, even if
they don't--

592
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:40,730
even if they don't,
your martyrdom will be just as effective.

593
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,166
Do you understand?

594
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,168
Yes.

595
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:49,473
Tarek will be meeting us
and showing us the device

596
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:50,474
that you'll be using.

597
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,072
The uniform of soldier.

598
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,249
It's good to see
you again, Samih.

599
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:43,186
I trust Amir Khan has
been taking care of you.

600
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:44,621
He has been most kind.

601
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,369
Has Amir Khan taken
you through the task?

602
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:02,939
Yes.

603
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:14,951
Trigger, timer.

604
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:26,395
Boom!

605
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:28,524
Samih, I have to go.

606
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,259
See you soon.

607
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,778
Do you wish another one?

608
01:15:49,613 --> 01:15:51,280
If you allow it.

609
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:53,750
Anything you wish, Samih.

610
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:02,558
Samih, close your eyes.

611
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:09,265
What do you hear?

612
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,102
Traffic.

613
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,473
People.

614
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:21,144
Shop.

615
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,246
Life?

616
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:30,019
In order to do the task
you have set out to do,

617
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:34,658
you have to accept an
end to all of this.

618
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:39,896
These sights, these sounds,
these senses,

619
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,731
to a life of marriage,

620
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:44,701
children, the pursuit of any
dreams that you may have had.

621
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,736
I know what I'm doing.

622
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,004
Do you?

623
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:50,173
Your mother is still alive.

624
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,008
She's already lost a son.

625
01:16:52,676 --> 01:16:55,478
Do you really wish to
see her lose another?

626
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,180
Won't she miss you?

627
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,216
Why are you asking
me such questions?

628
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:05,021
Doubt is as strong of
an encourager as faith.

629
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:06,856
My brother had doubts.

630
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,358
His faith won over
at the end, did it not?

631
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:21,705
Samih, we have to say
goodbye to a thousand things

632
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:23,973
when we choose the
time of our passing.

633
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:31,815
It is-- it is not wrong
to feel conflicted.

634
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:34,350
I am not the one conflicted.

635
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:37,721
What I lose here,
I will get in paradise.

636
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:41,725
That is where my brother will
be waiting and my father.

637
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:48,264
You should be cautious
in your tones.

638
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,999
People might think things.

639
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:55,171
I-- I was just trying
to see how resolute

640
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:57,173
you are in your convictions.

641
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,008
I see you are.

642
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,246
I'm not thirsty anymore.

643
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:04,881
OK.

644
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,014
Don't you want to watch?

645
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:13,850
She should cover herself up.

646
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:18,454
God forbid that a
man find a woman attractive

647
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:22,325
or find joy in song.

648
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:29,432
Samih, when someone
cannot express themselves,

649
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,836
Are you with us, Amir Khan?

650
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:42,605
Yes, Samih.

651
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:47,176
I am with you in any
direction you choose to take.

652
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,678
I choose the direction I am on.

653
01:24:08,311 --> 01:24:09,145
I'm so sorry.

654
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:11,380
Please don't tell
my grandmother.

655
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,149
I won't.

656
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:15,484
It's disrespectful of me in
the face of what's to come.

657
01:24:15,618 --> 01:24:16,619
I apologize.

658
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:19,422
There's no need.

659
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,589
And I won't tell.

660
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,258
Thank you.

661
01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:26,095
What was that song?

662
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,564
Actually, your
brother gave it to me.

663
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,436
Do you want to listen to it?

664
01:25:44,373 --> 01:25:47,075
Your future is in paradise.

665
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:49,545
It's not in this world.

666
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:52,481
And certainly not in this house.

667
01:26:48,103 --> 01:26:51,774
My
name is Samih Mohammed.

668
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:55,644
I was born in Detroit, Michigan,
in the United States of America.

669
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,980
I grew up under
tyranny of hypocrisy,

670
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:01,116
which you term Western culture.

671
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:04,219
In this culture,
I was brainwashed,

672
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,221
pulled away from
piety and respect

673
01:27:06,322 --> 01:27:08,757
that a child should be taught.

674
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:12,961
My father, Mahmud Mohammed,
and my brother, Rasin Mohammed,

675
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,162
saw this.

676
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:17,733
My name is Rasin Mohammed,
son of Mahmud Mohammed.

677
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:22,170
Helping our people, and
returning me to my birthright.

678
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:23,839
They have succeeded
on every level.

679
01:27:28,143 --> 01:27:32,815
To my mother,
I pay the respects that every child should

680
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:36,251
and know that she will
understand this sacrifice.

681
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:39,855
It should be every mother's
joy to see that a child has

682
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:43,258
been chosen for such an
honor and blessing as the one

683
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,127
that I have.

684
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:49,632
What I do today is in the
name of Allah the merciful.

685
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,502
And by this act,
you will know that a son of America has seen the truth.

686
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,603
Today, a son of America--

687
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:56,872
And you too will
know to seek it.

688
01:28:50,493 --> 01:28:54,196
To you alone we worship,
and alone we pray for help.

689
01:28:56,599 --> 01:28:58,734
Guide us to
the straight path,

690
01:28:59,602 --> 01:29:01,870
the path of those
whom you favored,

691
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03,572
the prophet and his successors.

692
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:09,845
Not of those
who incurred your wrath,

693
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,848
nor of those who
have gone astray.

694
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:33,969
Samih, my son, it is
important to know what we

695
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:37,640
say and more so what it means.

696
01:29:40,443 --> 01:29:44,279
It is very easy to
lose sight of oneself

697
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:47,816
when one stops seeking himself.

698
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,219
Look at your hands.

699
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:58,126
Just as two fingers are made
equal,

700
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:02,798
God made all of mankind equal.

701
01:30:05,568 --> 01:30:09,572
God does not show mercy to
those who are unkind to mankind.

702
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:14,943
These are the prophet's words.

703
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,452
May I come in, Samih?

704
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,353
Yeah.

705
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:33,095
I wanted to apologize again.

706
01:30:33,195 --> 01:30:36,298
I have not been completely
honest with you.

707
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,768
Your brother was here
much longer than you were.

708
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:43,305
We grew close.

709
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:46,308
Nothing happened.
You must believe this.

710
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,712
We were just fond of each other.

711
01:30:50,312 --> 01:30:52,314
I loved talking to him.

712
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:57,786
I didn't want him to leave.

713
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:09,164
I wasn't at the college to
watch him martyr himself.

714
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,866
I pulled a wire...

715
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:18,140
and thought that he would
just be arrested.

716
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:25,814
And then we could--
and he would escape.

717
01:31:29,585 --> 01:31:31,353
I stayed to pray.

718
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:38,761
But by the time I came out,
they'd already shot him.

719
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:47,035
He just stared.

720
01:31:49,872 --> 01:31:52,675
And all I could do
was turn and run.

721
01:31:58,914 --> 01:32:01,516
He was so proud of you, Samih.

722
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:05,387
When you see him in
paradise, tell him I'm sorry.

723
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,056
I should not have put myself
ahead of Allah's will.

724
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:38,821
I'm sorry.

725
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:39,988
I'm sorry, Samih.

726
01:32:40,088 --> 01:32:42,324
I was just horsing
around before.

727
01:32:42,424 --> 01:32:43,291
Wake up, Samih!

728
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,927
Wake up!

729
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:45,761
Wake up, Samih.

730
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:46,494
Wake up!

731
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:48,163
I didn't mean to push you.
Wake up!

732
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:50,065
Wake up, Samih!

733
01:32:51,934 --> 01:32:53,902
Thank Allah you are alive.

734
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:08,684
Samih?

735
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:31,259
I'll take Afsa and Grandma
out in a little while.

736
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:36,398
You better leave in a
little while after us.

737
01:35:36,498 --> 01:35:40,936
And may Allah show you
the path of righteousness.

738
01:37:59,942 --> 01:38:01,143
Run!

739
01:38:03,478 --> 01:38:05,147
Yushua!

740
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:05,981
Yushua!

741
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:12,820
Yushua!

742
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,925
Yushua!

743
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,067
Samih!

744
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:34,242
Samih!

745
01:38:59,167 --> 01:39:00,768
Yushua!

746
01:39:11,813 --> 01:39:13,215
Yushua!

747
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:17,385
Yushua!

748
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:29,864
Yushua!

749
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:31,466
