Sunil come soon son.

4
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,368
Beware.

5
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:13,712
Dad!

6
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:23,777
So you think Mr Vishwanath...

7
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:28,233
-...did you get hit by that car on purpose?
- Yes.

8
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:30,712
but why?

9
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,671
I am...

10
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,564
By me...

11
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,849
I am...

12
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:54,094
Hariram had given
this death declaration.

13
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,179
That you ran him
over on purpose.

14
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:59,106
There is no plan.

15
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,168
That thief deserved
only such a death.

16
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,027
Look Ajith.

17
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,909
If the police arrest me.

18
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,467
After that you, take care of my future work.

19
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:12,210
And my daughter Anita.

20
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,998
Now it's up to you.

21
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:18,082
And my wife...

22
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,562
I kicked her out of the house.

23
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:23,242
Who is expecting another child?

24
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:26,513
Not even his shadow should
fall on my daughter Anita.

25
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,401
Run, the police are coming.

26
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,129
Run away... for what?

27
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:33,469
What is left of my life now?

28
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:36,106
Who is Mr. Vishwanath?

29
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,689
- I am.
- We came to arrest you.

30
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,194
- Good.
- Come on.

31
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:42,264
Ajith.

32
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:49,540
Sunil!  is he your friend

33
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,620
Yes.

34
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,612
Do you see this wall?

35
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:54,215
I need a picture of that place.

36
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:56,201
I will do it.

37
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:59,096
Listen to this!

38
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,409
Who made this balance sheet?

39
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,269
Melaram Dahanda, he makes it.

40
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,331
So that's the reason.

41
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:45,432
Hello Sunil.

42
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:48,931
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

43
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:50,682
Because you were busy.

44
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:53,008
I thought of going back.  but...

45
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,627
- I didn't want to go back.
- Does that mean?

46
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,368
Why did you come here?

47
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,422
- I came to you for a special purpose.
- tell me.

48
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,584
Matter...

49
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:05,789
- Who is this girl?
- Someone who "models".

50
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,908
Where did you find her?

51
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:09,764
She was near the Birla
temple.  I brought her here.

52
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,474
- What is your business?
- Okay.

53
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,438
My boss Mr. Chopra...

54
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,629
She is like a portrait in herself.

55
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,769
What portrait do
you make of her?

56
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,513
How much do you
get for her photo?

57
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,921
Maybe three or four thousand.

58
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:29,048
- Yes, what did you say about Mr. Chopra?
- Yes.

59
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:30,214
Mr. Chopra...

60
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,422
How much does this girl pay?

61
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:37,001
Two or three rupees.  Maybe five.

62
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:38,796
You are mean, Bharti.

63
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:40,672
You earn thousands.

64
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,952
She is paid only
three to four rupees.

65
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,606
Now tell me about Mr. Chopra.

66
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,890
Yes, Mr. Chopra wants
to buy a painting of yours.

67
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,742
Sir, someone from "Lalit Art" has come.

68
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:53,876
I'll be back.

69
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,269
what is your name?

70
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,265
Anita.

71
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:09,000
Anita?  That name...

72
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,557
Yes, indeed...

73
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,494
They also want to
be rich someday.

74
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,807
They too will get wealth one day.

75
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,682
They see money everywhere.

76
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:22,760
- what is this?
- A simple gift.

77
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,008
No, I didn't mean that.

78
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,348
I willingly give it.

79
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,707
I don't mind if
you don't accept it.

80
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,058
I don't know how to thank you.

81
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:34,799
But Mr. Bharti...

82
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,751
Why tell that to Bharti?

83
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,797
This is between you and me.

84
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:40,682
Sunil.

85
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:45,731
Well done Sunil.

86
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:48,543
- I will come to see Mr. Chopra tomorrow.
- Okay.

87
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:02,390
what happened?

88
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:04,942
Like a play.

89
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,009
You don't pay me.

90
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,641
But your friend, took pity.

91
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,319
I was given this money.

92
00:09:11,394 --> 00:09:13,191
- You should have returned it.
- Why is that?

93
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,678
This is the first gift...

94
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,265
...someone gave it to me.

95
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,792
All others worship my money.

96
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,390
- Who is he?
- Sunil.

97
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:24,269
A very interesting person indeed.

98
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,369
You have to meet him and know him.

99
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,066
What would you like
to know about him?

100
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,971
- He works at Chopra & Co.
- Chopra and Co.?

101
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:33,954
But don't tell him who I am.

102
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:36,200
Are you going to meet him?

103
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,153
why not?  It will be real fun.

104
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:41,004
- I fool him a little more.
- What are you talking about, Anu?

105
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:42,461
Sunil is a very honest man.

106
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,647
He may be, but I am not.

107
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,793
Let this game go for a while.

108
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,753
- Where are you going?  sit down
- No, I'm going now.

109
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:53,201
- I want to come with Meena from the hotel.
- Mina, who?

110
00:09:58,517 --> 00:09:59,602
Meena.

111
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,647
- Where is Anita?
- There are

112
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:17,158
- She is now at Bharti's house.
- Alone?

113
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,474
Didn't you go with her?

114
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:20,890
- She said...
- I told you!

115
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,129
What did I keep you
for?  did you forget

116
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:27,307
Advised you not to leave
her alone with a young man.

117
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,848
I made a mistake.

118
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:42,432
- Anita.
- Anita?

119
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:45,455
She is a rich woman.

120
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,669
Stores all over India..

121
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:49,182
Yes friend.

122
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:57,106
Mrs. Anita, please come
and have a cup of tea with me.

123
00:10:57,187 --> 00:10:59,663
- No, thank you.
- Please, Miss Anita, a cup of coffee.

124
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:02,891
I said I don't feel like
drinking coffee now.

125
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,552
I made a poem
about you Miss Anita.

126
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,635
bless you.

127
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:09,549
Go home and read it
first in front of your mother.

128
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,718
Let's go Meena.

129
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,416
Pieces of this scarf...

130
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,514
...share among yourselves.

131
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:40,874
Ma'am...?

132
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,307
Yes, put it there.

133
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:51,598
see.

134
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:57,473
What a beautiful saree.

135
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:01,040
- This color really suits you.
- No, wrong.

136
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:04,474
- I brought it for you.
- to me...?

137
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,170
- No.
- Look, Mina.

138
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,091
My things are the same as yours.

139
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:10,182
Eat, wear, be happy.

140
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,090
But don't worry, got it?

141
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,057
- Yes, but.
- But no stories.

142
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,761
- Joseph.
- Yes, ma'am.

143
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,932
Put those in Meena's room.

144
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,206
I forgot to tell you.

145
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:26,903
A strange drama happened
at Bharti's place today.

146
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,329
- A drama?
- Yes, you already know that he draws a picture of me.

147
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:32,307
A young man came there.

148
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:34,822
- Handsome?
- Listen.

149
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:37,952
- So are you.
- Then bless me.

150
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:42,199
Listen to me first.  That
guy really thought I was poor.

151
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:49,682
Actually, Meena, he
didn't know that I was rich.

152
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:53,742
Look at the five pound
note he gave me.

153
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,057
No one gives me a single rupee.

154
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,326
bless you.

155
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:05,723
- This is the smell of love.
- Look where I am too.

156
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:21,509
- Bharti.
- Hello, Anita, you came at the right time.

157
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:25,057
- There is something to surprise you.
- Surprise?

158
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:31,348
- What is it?
- Gift.

159
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,473
- Sunil has sent you.
- Sunil?

160
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:38,265
He continues to think
that you are a poor girl.

161
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,686
Driver, drive the car.

162
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,432
Stop here.

163
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,370
- your...?
- Anita, you?

164
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,576
Yes, I received the saree you sent.

165
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,086
I don't know how to thank you.

166
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,557
You saved my
modesty in another way.

167
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,466
I was ashamed to come
wearing those tattered clothes.

168
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,821
what are you saying?

169
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,639
How do I look now?

170
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:54,172
- Great.
- Thank you.

171
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,685
- This necklace?
- Necklace?

172
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,009
- It was given to me by the landlady.

173
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,464
It has fake diamonds.

174
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,660
The fakes look more expensive.

175
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:11,684
you are right.

176
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,432
- But your landlady...
- She is very generous.

177
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,360
- Come on, I don't want to be here.
- Why is that?

178
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:20,924
Tell me you don't like me.

179
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,849
That's not the problem, Anita.

180
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:25,541
Ma'am, the car...

181
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,795
who are you  Get out of here!

182
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,848
Look Sunil, some rich drivers...

183
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,839
-...is being sent after me.
- The rich...?

184
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:35,320
- Who are you?
- Let him go Sunil.

185
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,668
Don't get involved.

186
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:38,891
Hang on Anita, I'll teach him a lesson.

187
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:47,329
Why are they following me?

188
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,954
- Am I beautiful?
- Yes, Anita.

189
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:52,629
Simply put, or...

190
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,552
...Am I very beautiful?

191
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,829
Yes, you are very beautiful.

192
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:00,057
Then.  Let's go.

193
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:08,158
- Hello Anita.
- your...?

194
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:09,769
who are you

195
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:13,596
- I'm sorry I mistook you for Mrs. Anita.
- Come Sunil.

196
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:18,198
Maybe there is
someone else like you.

197
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:20,863
Yes, maybe.

198
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,116
Maybe she is a
rich and famous girl.

199
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:25,473
hmm  may be.

200
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,641
Why don't you sit down?

201
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,890
Anita you are really very beautiful.

202
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,104
That's what everyone says.

203
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,521
But everyone just
wants to be friendly.

204
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,575
No one agrees to take
responsibility for marriage.

205
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:01,541
No.  I didn't
mention you like that.

206
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:05,307
I feel more scared without you.

207
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:10,776
I too am an orphan, motherless and fatherless.

208
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:13,703
Don't your parents
ask you to get married?

209
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:16,075
Anita, I don't have a father.

210
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,042
Only sister and mother.

211
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:21,390
And they always
pester me to get married.

212
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,211
Mother wants me to get
married to a good family.

213
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:28,057
- But I'm not ready to do that.
- Why is that?

214
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:31,291
I really hate rich people.

215
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:36,018
Oh shit.  why so?

216
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:38,973
There is a reason.

217
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:44,293
I will only marry a poor girl.

218
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,996
Have you found someone?

219
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,398
I'm looking for someone.

220
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:52,584
You are very shameless.

221
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:54,985
I leave.

222
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:56,699
I will take you to your house.

223
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:58,425
Home?  No.  I am not a child.

224
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:03,432
It's not my house either.
I am at a friend's place.

225
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:07,304
I won't take you
anywhere I can't seat you.

226
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:49,338
I'm going to Bharti's place, you?

227
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:53,037
I was returning
from a friend's place.

228
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:55,798
Let's sit down.

229
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:58,929
Come on.

230
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,281
Sunil.

231
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:11,621
- I won't be long today.
- Why, Anita?

232
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:13,526
I want to go home early.

233
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,014
- What's the rush?
- what to do?

234
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,199
I fear the people of this world.

235
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:21,415
God should not make anyone poor.

236
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,494
Poor?

237
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:26,063
- Anita, I know how rich you are.
- I am?

238
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,876
very rich

239
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:32,045
What you call your
poverty is really your beauty.

240
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,750
your beautiful

241
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,555
- Anita.
- Hmm.

242
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:42,411
Sunil Someone is calling me.

243
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:55,467
will you be mine

244
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,246
Sunil.

245
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,311
But Sunil.

246
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,472
tell me something

247
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:08,900
- Do you hate people with money?
- There is a reason for that.

248
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:11,183
Let me take you home.

249
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,482
No, Sunil I will go.

250
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,823
I want to put you home, come on.

251
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:19,536
God Sunil, I will go alone.

252
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:22,417
- I have nowhere to go.
- Let's go quickly.

253
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:26,060
I will put you

254
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,977
- You go now.
- Hello, madam.

255
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:39,293
- Goodbye, dad.
- Welcome.

256
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,779
Listen to this!  Anita, you said
you were an orphan, didn't you?

257
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,132
Yes, it is.

258
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:50,450
He calls me ``Ma'am'' and
I address him as ``Dad''.

259
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:52,900
Everyone makes fun of me in
different ways because I am poor.

260
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,688
I spend my days in the
garage of this bungalow.

261
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:56,990
Now you go.

262
00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:00,399
- Do you live in a garage?
- No, yes.  go now

263
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:02,538
Why do you want to send me?

264
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:04,232
I'll go check the garage.

265
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,853
Hello, madam.

266
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:11,214
Welcome!  I was
very late today, sister.

267
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:14,300
Since when did I
become your aunt?

268
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:15,972
What does she say?

269
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:18,372
She is a Punjabi woman,
she doesn't want to grow old.

270
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:22,292
She wants to see herself
called "sister".  I call her "Aunt".

271
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:25,557
- Madam, may I stop the car?
- Park it.

272
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:27,789
Why are you asking me?
Ask the owner.

273
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:30,314
- He's the same, the wretch!
- No.

274
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,920
No, he is not like that.

275
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:36,001
Listen to me.
All drivers are the same.

276
00:25:37,365 --> 00:25:39,789
This is the owner of the house.
He is Sunil.

277
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:47,556
Sunil, talk to my landlady here.

278
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,338
I wore her necklace that day.

279
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,500
- Please come and sit down.
- No, thank you.

280
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,988
She is a good person.

281
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:55,923
Not all rich people are the same.

282
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:59,317
- Please come.
- No, I'll come another day.

283
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:06,527
Aunty, don't take my name in this.

284
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,427
I am telling you what I
saw with my own eyes.

285
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:11,036
If this is not the case...

286
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:12,771
...hold everyone together.

287
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,392
Be sure that some
trouble is likely to come.

288
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:18,243
- Hello, brother Dhand.
- Welcome.

289
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:19,545
Tell me some new information.

290
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,210
what's new  It is not new now.

291
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,331
The whole city knows about it.

292
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,765
Well aunty, I will go now.

293
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:28,346
will come again.

294
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,442
- Sunil.
- Why mom?

295
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:36,588
I didn't think you would do this.

296
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:38,526
That you defame…

297
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:40,365
-...your late father's name.
- Mother!

298
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,445
If you didn't think about him.

299
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,491
At least they should
have thought about us.

300
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:47,131
At least you should have thought
that your sister was still unmarried.

301
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:49,032
What is happening to us now?

302
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:51,650
What's wrong mom?

303
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:54,796
We knew everything.

304
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,195
What did you find out?  For
God's sake, please tell me.

305
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:58,994
God, speak up, what happened?

306
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,838
- You got married, didn't you?
- Married?

307
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,272
- And you have children.
- Children...?

308
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:05,441
I know.

309
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,160
This bastard Dhand, he came here?

310
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:10,771
- I won't let him.
- Sunil, do that later.

311
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,047
First of all, why
didn't you tell us?

312
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,289
What did I not say, mother?

313
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,101
You know how Dhand is.

314
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:18,411
He must have seen me
talking to Anita somewhere.

315
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,766
- So there is nothing there?
- Yes.

316
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:23,788
Why don't you understand that
even mountains are raised by Dhand?

317
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:25,842
He shows inches,
stretching hundreds of meters.

318
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:27,769
Mom, this is what happened.

319
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:30,236
I gave some money
and a saree to a poor girl.

320
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,915
And she came to thank me.

321
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:35,643
Did you take her to the
garden to give thanks?

322
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,797
- Yes, she was taken to the garden.
- Next...?

323
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,027
oh mom  Then she went
back to where she was.

324
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:42,227
- I came to my house.
- Where are my grandchildren?

325
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:44,192
This stupid dhand.

326
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:50,187
what did you say?  Anita has
been following him for days?

327
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:53,192
Check back often for Anita.

328
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,127
Let me know the details.

329
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:58,074
Isn't that why I keep you?

330
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,294
who is that

331
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:08,706
great

332
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,752
Like a wave in water.

333
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:13,612
You look so beautiful in this saree.

334
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:15,477
Did you send the contract papers?

335
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:18,002
I think after many years...

336
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,817
...I was given this privilege...

337
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:21,706
...to call you 'Anu'
instead of 'Anita'.

338
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:23,128
please sit down!

339
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:26,309
on the chair

340
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:33,871
I heard you raised the price.

341
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:36,722
Yes, some of them have increased in price.

342
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,442
Some have gone down.

343
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:40,503
Does that mean?

344
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:41,944
This is the point.

345
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:45,680
Make a decision
on prices, I called.

346
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:49,253
A meeting of the directors
at the gymkhana at four.

347
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:52,711
At four today?  No.

348
00:28:53,256 --> 00:28:55,147
I have another job at four.

349
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:57,332
You can go after the meeting.

350
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:03,497
don't forget  At four o'clock.

351
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,419
There is no one here.

352
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,377
Me, don't you look like a man?

353
00:29:27,313 --> 00:29:29,854
I think we are on
time, they are late.

354
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:32,952
Let's sit on our hands.

355
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:35,912
No, it's fine here.

356
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,079
This is an opportunity...

357
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,753
...to spend some time with each other.

358
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:50,463
When the wind changes its course.

359
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:52,048
It came to me.

360
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,890
Your fragrance filled
my heart for a long time.

361
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:59,473
Are you sure the director's
meeting is scheduled for today?

362
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:02,413
I may have
misunderstood the date.

363
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,419
Take today for us.

364
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:06,118
What do you mean?

365
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:09,139
How long will you
ignore me Anoo?

366
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:10,798
You know it.

367
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:13,277
In any case, I am
always at your disposal.

368
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:14,268
Waiter.

369
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:15,347
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:19,148
Bring some cigarettes from the shop.

371
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:21,116
We have cigarettes, sir.

372
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,836
No, I want imported ones.
Get me a packet of Rothmans.

373
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:25,579
Before that, bring tea here.

374
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:28,508
- Well, bring tea.
- Okay, sir.

375
00:30:30,925 --> 00:30:32,707
I thought

376
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:35,944
You had no desire.

377
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,020
Who doesn't like Ajith?

378
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,252
What girl can
survive in this world.

379
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:47,227
- Without that?
- That is since your father passed away.

380
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,843
I keep waiting for you.

381
00:30:49,923 --> 00:30:52,789
Waiting for a few more days.

382
00:30:53,162 --> 00:30:55,207
That I would be allowed
to hold your hand.

383
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,237
- Really?
- Yes.

384
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,288
Now hold my bag.
I will be back soon.

385
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:27,362
Meena, what were you doing?

386
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:30,942
Nothing, just sitting and getting bored.

387
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:32,252
the liar

388
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:34,752
You live for others
and not for yourself.

389
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,503
How can such a person be bored?

390
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:38,378
Who do I live for?

391
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:40,611
Me too...

392
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:44,996
I was alone.  It's depressing.

393
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,538
When Ajith was introduced.

394
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:50,838
His identification was
of little importance to me.

395
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,543
Regarding your acceptance of it.

396
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,668
What are you saying Anu?

397
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,882
Instead, you helped me.

398
00:31:57,331 --> 00:32:00,182
By giving it a place in
your home and heart.

399
00:32:01,668 --> 00:32:04,085
No Meena you don't know...

400
00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:07,877
...it is much easier to give than to receive.

401
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:09,262
Just look.

402
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:11,086
The way I took care of you.

403
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,430
You were given clothes and jewelry.

404
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:15,273
You accepted it all happily.

405
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,714
That's a great setup you've done.

406
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,836
A great act of kindness.

407
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:22,782
Anu?

408
00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:24,998
Yes.

409
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:28,057
Ajith is my manager right?

410
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,668
He must know everything about me.

411
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:33,048
But he has his own limitations.

412
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,605
He can't watch me all the time.

413
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,378
You tell him everything
on the phone.

414
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:41,478
It is very convenient for me.

415
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,762
I am truly grateful
to you for all this.

416
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,711
Now I am going to meet Sunil.

417
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:50,186
I know Ajith doesn't
like me meeting Sunil.

418
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,184
But whatever a man
hopes for cannot come true.

419
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:56,502
Atleast inform Ajith on phone.

420
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:59,003
i understood

421
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,885
I have committed a great sin.

422
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:05,199
Oh, I'm sorry Anoo.
Please forgive me.

423
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,976
No.  do not say that.

424
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:11,085
Every time I look at you.

425
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,460
I feel like you are my sister.

426
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,925
Please don't embarrass
me by saying that.

427
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:17,502
I don't deserve it.

428
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,086
I don't deserve your love.

429
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:22,462
kick me out of the house

430
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,914
No.  do not Cry.

431
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,710
Don't cry Pisces.

432
00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:33,295
- Ajith.
- I'll take care of him.

433
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:36,829
It is not good to take time to change.

434
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,668
- Hello Ajith.
- Welcome.

435
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,544
- Where is Anita?
- Anita...

436
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:49,596
She is not outside.
are inside.  Hello Sunil.

437
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,526
who is he

438
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:55,501
I didn't tell you.
He is my groom.

439
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,377
We recently got engaged.

440
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:06,157
Hello Sunil, you have come at the right time.

441
00:34:06,237 --> 00:34:07,668
I got engaged today.

442
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:10,871
- best wishes.
- That's why Anita is late.

443
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:13,769
He is my groom.
Come, let me introduce.

444
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,106
Ajith... Sunil... my boyfriend.

445
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:21,740
- best wishes.
- best wishes.

446
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:23,793
- My bag?
- your?

447
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:25,327
Anita had taken it.

448
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,938
Well, then I'll go.

449
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:32,387
Welcome.

450
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:38,949
Hello, Anita.

451
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,878
How about my jewelry and clothes?

452
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:48,832
very pretty.

453
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:50,377
You're very kind.

454
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:54,211
kind?  I can be very rude too.

455
00:34:54,474 --> 00:34:57,496
- Come in
- No, I have to take Anita.

456
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:04,003
My boyfriend left me here.
OK, bye.

457
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:08,086
Anita, come on.
Mom wants to see you.

458
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:10,918
stay here  I will
change my saree.

459
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,213
This is good.
Mom will be happy to see you.

460
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:22,086
Mother!  Get in.

461
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:27,789
Mom, this is Anita.

462
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,887
Bless you, daughter!

463
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:33,769
This is your future sister-in-law.

464
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:36,730
Mom, do you like her?

465
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:40,355
My son, you do not
know that I am urgent.

466
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:42,322
- For a grandchild?
- For the wedding.

467
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,957
Now that you're here,
I can't blame him.

468
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:49,480
Don't worry.  I
will do it for you.

469
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:55,802
Sunil, everything has been said about you.

470
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,793
Don't worry.

471
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:00,530
I will be a mother-in-law to him.

472
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,288
And you become a mother.

473
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,085
Mother!

474
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:38,117
Anita, where are you going?

475
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,396
hey what happened to you

476
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,135
A time like this is coming...

477
00:42:00,494 --> 00:42:02,155
...when one doesn't like bed.

478
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:05,068
Yes.  It happens.

479
00:42:05,862 --> 00:42:08,789
- A cable message arrived from London.
- A cable?

480
00:42:14,255 --> 00:42:16,884
- Ramesh is coming.
- all right.

481
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,197
- Ramesh, who is that?
- he!

482
00:42:23,056 --> 00:42:25,671
- When will he come?
- Tomorrow.

483
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:46,509
Anita, you?

484
00:42:48,702 --> 00:42:49,793
Bless you, daughter!

485
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:51,156
Miss Meena, how are you?

486
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,742
Anita, he is Melaram Dhand.
For someone who is single...

487
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:00,114
...His advice is very helpful.

488
00:43:00,193 --> 00:43:01,719
A very helpful person indeed.

489
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,489
Mom!  It's Miss Meena.
Anita is the owner of the place.

490
00:43:05,572 --> 00:43:06,655
- Hello, daughter.
- Welcome.

491
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:09,442
- Come on, daughter.
- Please come, Mrs. Mina.

492
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,405
Why did you come here?

493
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:14,572
my...

494
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:17,971
The landlady's friend is coming
today from London, he is Ramesh.

495
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:21,275
- Ramesh... Ramesh Kapoor?
- Yes.

496
00:43:21,355 --> 00:43:23,395
- We are also here to welcome him.
- is it?

497
00:43:23,474 --> 00:43:25,297
He is Mohini's boyfriend.

498
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,492
- my goodness.
- Why, what?

499
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:30,168
Nothing, that's fine.

500
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,206
Come on.  The plane may have arrived.

501
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:37,012
Sunil, wait a minute, I will come.

502
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:48,771
A big problem has arisen.

503
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:50,252
Ramesh is his friend.

504
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:52,565
You talk hot stuff.

505
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:55,207
You are always joking.

506
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:57,383
As soon as he arrives,
my true identity is revealed.

507
00:43:57,407 --> 00:44:00,320
- Everything is revealed.
- It has to happen.

508
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:02,218
Why not allow it?

509
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:04,175
And Sunil already loves you.

510
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,699
Yes, but not
according to this trick.

511
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,727
God willing, don't worry about it.

512
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,762
Let's make his luggage
disappear from customs.  Come on.

513
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,088
Sorry.

514
00:44:35,081 --> 00:44:36,258
This is the problem.

515
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:39,154
One day I wore some old clothes...

516
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:41,590
...created a painting of me
in place of the Bharati artist.

517
00:44:41,614 --> 00:44:42,822
Sunil came there that day.

518
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:44,514
From there this thing started.

519
00:44:44,824 --> 00:44:46,605
From then on I had to act poor.

520
00:44:46,691 --> 00:44:48,742
I, if I meet him well dressed…

521
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:50,798
...had to say I got
them from Mina.

522
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:53,534
Once poor, it is very
difficult to become rich again.

523
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:55,030
You're kidding.

524
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,544
- I really don't know what to do.
- What to do...?

525
00:44:57,568 --> 00:44:59,608
Then throw a party
celebrating Ramesh's arrival.

526
00:44:59,688 --> 00:45:01,101
Tell him to come.

527
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:02,181
ok

528
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:06,928
thank you

529
00:45:07,027 --> 00:45:09,060
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

530
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:13,706
Who is... Sunil?

531
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:15,864
Sunil, this is Anita.

532
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:18,095
There is a party at Miss
Meena's house this evening.

533
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,309
A party at her house?

534
00:45:19,731 --> 00:45:23,114
Anita, I don't attend
rich people's parties.

535
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:25,322
He is coming.

536
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:27,771
He also takes
his friend with him.

537
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,524
This habit of his is very bad.

538
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,197
He refuses and finally repents.

539
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,260
- Just like women.
- Who is this freak?

540
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,617
Not a freak.
This is Melaram Dhand.

541
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:41,822
Stop it!

542
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:44,514
I am actually a
close friend of Sunil.

543
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:46,155
He is not a villain.

544
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,992
I say yes a hundred times.

545
00:45:48,072 --> 00:45:50,621
I say I will come again.

546
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:53,955
Don't worry, I'll come with him.

547
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:47,107
Mr. Dhand, who invited you?

548
00:46:47,331 --> 00:46:49,247
Although no one called me...

549
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:51,222
...I'm coming alone.

550
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:56,125
Nita why did you order kaju?
Cashews are not good.

551
00:46:56,204 --> 00:47:01,717
Have chicken, duck, hot-dogs?

552
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:04,891
- Be quiet.
- OK, bring food without hot-dogs.

553
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:20,230
Please come, food is ready.

554
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:40,747
Mrs. Anita give
me one plate too.

555
00:47:40,827 --> 00:47:43,427
I am very helpful.

556
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,376
thank you

557
00:47:46,692 --> 00:47:49,079
- Hello, sir.
- Welcome.

558
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:52,416
where is the chicken

559
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:02,961
- Sunil.
- Yes?

560
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,619
- Why did you come here?
- Mrs. Meena invited me.

561
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,893
She is Anita's friend.
Anita is my girlfriend.

562
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:11,923
- Anita... your girlfriend?
- Yes.

563
00:48:12,003 --> 00:48:14,230
What are you talking about?
This millionaire girl?

564
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,396
You are confused sir.

565
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:17,912
She is very poor.

566
00:48:17,992 --> 00:48:20,297
She is Anita, who has businesses all over India.

567
00:48:20,657 --> 00:48:21,897
With profits in the millions.

568
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:24,500
I am auditing her accounts.

569
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,114
He must have cheated on you.

570
00:48:27,326 --> 00:48:29,197
- what are you saying?
- I'm right.

571
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,677
Now the opportunity has
come for Sunil to tell everything.

572
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:38,334
I don't have the strength for it, brother.

573
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:41,271
Meena, why don't you go?

574
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,601
Do something and bring him here.

575
00:48:44,581 --> 00:48:45,958
why don't you go

576
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:48,101
Going!

577
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:51,970
I'm not waiting here.

578
00:48:58,911 --> 00:48:59,911
Miss Sunil!

579
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:10,253
- Ninety, big question.
- Sunil left.

580
00:49:21,788 --> 00:49:23,371
Sunil?

581
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:25,664
why this  You seem very upset.

582
00:49:25,998 --> 00:49:27,201
Who is this girl?

583
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:31,026
You are the one who gave money and saree.

584
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,997
Bharti, don't try to act.

585
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:35,664
Tell me clearly, who
is this young lady?

586
00:49:35,688 --> 00:49:37,701
You seem upset, why?

587
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:38,875
what happened

588
00:49:38,954 --> 00:49:41,197
No need for jokes.
Answer what I ask.

589
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:43,427
what to say  This
girl is a millionaire.

590
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,666
And even every kid
in Delhi knows her.

591
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:48,398
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?
- She asked me to...

592
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:51,660
-...not to tell you anything about her.
- What else did she say?

593
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:57,735
And she said that
this game will continue.

594
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:03,797
So this is a game
he played with me.

595
00:50:12,572 --> 00:50:14,865
You... What did you come here for?

596
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:17,704
I came to tell you something.
You have misunderstood...

597
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:19,974
- I don't want to hear anything.  Get out of here.
- Sunil.

598
00:50:19,998 --> 00:50:22,427
I wanted to tell you about
myself since a long time ago.

599
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:25,465
- But I was afraid.
- No need.  Get out of here.

600
00:50:36,882 --> 00:50:38,034
What happened to Anu?

601
00:50:40,202 --> 00:50:42,099
I was scared.

602
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:45,900
- Sunil will not come back.
- Did that happen?

603
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,094
I thought people
were afraid of poverty.

604
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,710
But this is the opposite.

605
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:03,429
I have an idea.

606
00:51:03,954 --> 00:51:07,787
- What's the point?
- Why don't you use dhandwa to understand Sunil?

607
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:09,540
A really good idea.

608
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:14,182
- Hello, brother Dhand.
- Hello, Tikaram.

609
00:51:14,262 --> 00:51:17,561
- Is there a strike today?
- Yes, apparently.

610
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,180
No.

611
00:51:19,262 --> 00:51:21,987
Everything in the world can be lost.

612
00:51:22,068 --> 00:51:25,341
But news is never like that.
Today's breaking news is...

613
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,140
...Ruldu and Buta Dindorchi's
daughter Shilu has run away...

614
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:32,647
...with Toti Halwai's
son Moti Halwai.

615
00:51:35,517 --> 00:51:38,637
Mr. Ruldu and Mr. Buta!
I was really sad to hear that.

616
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,179
- What is it?
- That's your daughter Shilu.

617
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,606
- Shilu...?  What happened to Sheelo?
- She ran away...

618
00:51:43,686 --> 00:51:45,168
...with Toti Halwai's son Moti.

619
00:51:45,248 --> 00:51:47,554
- Who told you that?
- Just now Dhand told me.

620
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:49,081
Dhand...?

621
00:51:49,346 --> 00:51:52,054
Has Dhand started
dancing with us now?

622
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:55,137
all right.  If we don't
teach him a lesson...

623
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:57,564
...we are no longer
our father's sons.

624
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,751
Uncle Dhand!

625
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:09,516
- Uncle Dhand!
- bless you.

626
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,054
I will go alone.
Where are you taking me?

627
00:52:12,135 --> 00:52:14,095
- Behind the bushes.
- Behind the bushes?

628
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:16,793
- What are you doing there?
- What kings do.

629
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:20,512
- But I am not a king.  Poor man, let me go.
- Let's take him.

630
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:24,974
leave me alone  let me
go  What are you doing?

631
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:26,078
Take off his clothes.

632
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:28,161
Clothes... what joke is this?

633
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:31,138
If anyone sees,
what are you doing?

634
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:33,728
keep quiet  We
take your clothes off.

635
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:36,471
What am I missing?

636
00:52:39,902 --> 00:52:42,790
Slow down, or
my pants might rip.

637
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:45,926
Put me in a wrestling suit.

638
00:52:46,007 --> 00:52:49,422
In the end, a man's clothes will also be lost.

639
00:52:50,054 --> 00:52:52,305
- Help!
- Let's hurry now.

640
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:56,179
Help!  save me  Catch them.

641
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:58,137
- They ran away.
- What happened sir?

642
00:52:58,217 --> 00:52:59,984
What else will happen?

643
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:02,179
You came late.

644
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,684
Go mind your own business.

645
00:53:39,835 --> 00:53:42,804
What is the beggar?
You always come, now go.

646
00:53:43,927 --> 00:53:50,448
What's the point of being in this
world if your child doesn't know you?

647
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:53,920
I am your father.

648
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,513
Open the door.

649
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:57,526
Dad, why is this?

650
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:02,945
This is a secret.  Only
God and I know about it.

651
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:13,179
Now that's right.  There
was no such trouble before.

652
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,180
Tell me, why did you come here?

653
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,661
Hello uncle.  What
happened to your clothes?

654
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,755
What can you tell me, Miss Meena?

655
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:22,762
- The opposite happened in Mahabharata.
- Does that mean?

656
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,137
I was swimming in the river with my friends.

657
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,949
Although the name is a beautiful girl...

658
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,403
...Radha came there
with a flute in her hand.

659
00:54:31,483 --> 00:54:34,316
I took my clothes and climbed the tree.

660
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,263
Then started singing.

661
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:38,137
"Say Dhanu"

662
00:54:38,217 --> 00:54:40,875
"Shall We Get Together Or Not"

663
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:44,141
I said we will definitely get together,
but she didn't return my clothes.

664
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:46,804
So I had to come like this.

665
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:49,632
Well Dhand uncle, I have
come for a special work.

666
00:54:49,713 --> 00:54:51,715
I can do anything for you.

667
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,721
It's Anita's business, not mine.

668
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,402
You know she loves
Sunil very much.

669
00:54:56,637 --> 00:55:00,054
But Sunil got angry with her
because she was very rich.

670
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:02,141
He returns to find
her and do something.

671
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:04,721
To come to her no matter the obstacles.

672
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,041
He will come, surely.

673
00:55:06,065 --> 00:55:08,221
Tomorrow morning.  Even his father will come.

674
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:11,682
- How is that?
- Leave it all to me.

675
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:13,501
OK, thank you very much.

676
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:14,629
will come again.

677
00:55:18,766 --> 00:55:20,409
I was very young.

678
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,387
These beautiful girls sent me to old age.

679
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:23,923
She addresses me as 'Mama'.

680
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:26,763
There are many other terms in the dictionary.

681
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:41,641
A straw tree looks
like a big tree.

682
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:44,554
But to others it
looks like straw.

683
00:55:44,635 --> 00:55:46,450
Brother Dhand, why is it so early in the morning?

684
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:50,641
I spread a rumor that day.

685
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:53,554
You tried to kill me because of it.

686
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:56,555
Today's newspapers say the same.
Read it.  Get it here.

687
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:03,554
That millionaire girl
Anita has got engaged.

688
00:56:04,036 --> 00:56:05,762
Anita is engaged to... me?

689
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:08,157
Who is responsible
for this publication?

690
00:56:08,536 --> 00:56:10,096
I will not let that person.

691
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:14,809
what?  Yes...

692
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:16,303
He belongs to a
very famous family.

693
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:18,167
- Very rich in heart.
- What joke is this?

694
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:20,048
Who is responsible for
publishing this news?

695
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:22,360
That's what we were
going to ask you.

696
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,396
- Is the modesty of a young woman a joke?
- Is this a joke?

697
00:56:25,476 --> 00:56:27,528
Does this mean
you didn't publish it?

698
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:29,762
If it was done to us, we
would have asked you before.

699
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,040
Then it is announced.

700
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:34,914
- What made you want to do it like a thief?
- Why was it necessary?

701
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,191
- Someone from your side must be responsible for this.
- Yes, such a person.

702
00:56:37,215 --> 00:56:41,710
One of us...?  Now I
understand, this must be…

703
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:45,304
Dhand, gossip monger's nonsense.

704
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:52,532
What's going on now Pisces?

705
00:56:52,793 --> 00:56:54,157
Everything is over.

706
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,177
We have organized a big party.

707
00:56:56,257 --> 00:56:58,396
Many guests were invited.

708
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,749
If Sunil doesn't participate...?

709
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,409
Go tell the person who
messed this all up, Dhand.

710
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:07,724
Then you better go alone.

711
00:57:07,853 --> 00:57:09,739
God bless you, just go.

712
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:13,498
- Why should I go?  You did it.
- Yes.

713
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:15,628
Good.

714
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:21,987
I am not your enemy...

715
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:24,713
...even if you love someone else.

716
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:27,218
What is this news, did
you hide this from me?

717
00:57:27,297 --> 00:57:30,985
We are also in that trap.

718
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,710
A lot of calls are coming.

719
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:36,079
Instead of my name, people
posted her name there.

720
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:39,539
We are trying to
correct this error.

721
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,336
You congratulate Meena.

722
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:45,315
- best wishes!
- Thank you!

723
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:48,123
- Please come, have some tea.
- Please come.

724
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:54,583
- Everything is messed up, Uncle Dhand.
- what happened?

725
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,430
Sunil came with the newspaper in his hand.

726
00:57:56,454 --> 00:57:58,349
The newspaper is carried in the hand.

727
00:57:58,429 --> 00:58:00,422
No, uncle, he is very upset.

728
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,987
A big party has been
organized for the engagement.

729
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:06,130
It would be a big shame for
Annie if he didn't come that day.

730
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,236
Why doesn't he come?
Even his ancestors will come.

731
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:12,534
Wherever they are may be in
hell or heaven.  Listen to this!

732
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:18,516
Thank you very much.

733
00:58:18,597 --> 00:58:20,767
- You handle the rest.
- Don't worry.

734
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:22,438
I will go...?

735
00:58:22,994 --> 00:58:24,569
- Welcome!
- Uncle.

736
00:58:24,804 --> 00:58:26,646
Sorry.  you go

737
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:28,040
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

738
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:58,309
- Brother Sunil, Sunil!
- your...

739
00:58:58,388 --> 00:59:01,523
A rascal, a rascal, a rogue.
Get out of my house now.

740
00:59:01,547 --> 00:59:03,921
If you come here again,
I will break your legs.

741
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:05,322
why this

742
00:59:05,402 --> 00:59:07,529
You seem so innocent
asking me what happened.

743
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,222
This is all your nonsense.

744
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:14,110
I didn't know you were
such a mean person Sunil.

745
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,676
What idiot has done this?

746
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:18,861
It is said that a bad man
is better than a bad name.

747
00:59:18,885 --> 00:59:20,594
Even if someone's water
tap in the city runs dry...

748
00:59:20,675 --> 00:59:22,141
...I have become responsible for it.

749
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:24,486
If there is any fight, I have
to be responsible for that too.

750
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,476
Even if it's an accident, I have to take responsibility.

751
00:59:27,556 --> 00:59:30,639
- Am I a minister or someone else?
- If it wasn't you, who did this?

752
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:32,472
What do I know, who did this?

753
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:36,134
Every time I come you
jump on me as if to fight.

754
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,320
No consideration of
status or anything else.

755
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:39,574
Today I came to talk.

756
00:59:39,655 --> 00:59:42,332
About my daughter Rani...

757
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,984
- About the queen?
- Yes.

758
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:47,582
I chose a young man for her.

759
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:50,180
I can't recognize anyone.

760
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,217
All young men look
like frauds to me.

761
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,690
I can't get into trouble.

762
00:59:55,771 --> 00:59:57,470
So please come with me.

763
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,764
- It's about my daughter.
- Well, I'll come.

764
01:00:00,844 --> 01:00:03,562
- Where should we go?
- To a party, that young man is there.

765
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:07,260
But listen, even the mother-in-law is there.

766
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,385
So, dress well too.

767
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:12,420
And with a nice
matching French tie.

768
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:20,639
Brother Dhand.

769
01:00:47,762 --> 01:00:50,440
- Brother Dhand, such a big party?
- Yes...

770
01:00:51,197 --> 01:00:53,472
It is not poor people like us
who throw parties like this.

771
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:56,429
It was some rich people who got the itch.

772
01:00:57,427 --> 01:00:59,431
- Where is that young man?
- There are

773
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,427
He is near here.

774
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:17,139
Ramesh, you here...?

775
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:19,685
Dhand called me.  I
don't know where he went.

776
01:01:24,695 --> 01:01:26,931
- Mohini, what are you doing here?
- Came with Ramesh.

777
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,791
I don't know where he went now.

778
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:39,398
- Mina, you, here?
- I'm looking for my friend.

779
01:01:39,597 --> 01:01:40,750
I'm very sorry.

780
01:01:42,385 --> 01:01:43,737
This is a strange party.

781
01:01:44,036 --> 01:01:45,970
Everyone here is
looking for someone else.

782
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:49,328
got it?  He is the young man.

783
01:01:49,824 --> 01:01:52,760
- What young man?
- You are also young, aren't you?  If not, what else?

784
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,185
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you are that person.

785
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:57,847
- And this is the girl.
- Dhand!

786
01:01:57,927 --> 01:01:59,969
Congratulations, son!

787
01:02:00,893 --> 01:02:04,016
Come, come that way.

788
01:02:08,367 --> 01:02:10,165
She is Hariram's wife.

789
01:02:13,264 --> 01:02:17,702
Then Sunil, Hariram's son.

790
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:20,902
Brothers and sisters!

791
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,757
The train was parked on
the platform for a long time.

792
01:02:24,836 --> 01:02:28,699
Due to this, the traffic in the
entire city was at a standstill.

793
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,464
Its engine has finally arrived.

794
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:33,837
That means today in front of all of you...

795
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:35,735
They perform the 'coupling' ceremony.

796
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:39,109
It means that their
engagement will happen.

797
01:02:41,927 --> 01:02:45,284
Who is the boss to remove?

798
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:48,969
It is not necessary now.

799
01:02:49,844 --> 01:02:51,793
He dies a natural death.

800
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,516
Awesome!

801
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:02,313
- Brother.
- I don't want to.

802
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:05,287
- Please take it, brother.
- I said I don't want to, right?

803
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:26,212
Even if you are engaged, the
marriage will not take place.

804
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:28,308
This evening, at the party,
I will teach you a lesson.

805
01:10:28,332 --> 01:10:31,021
A lesson you will never forget.

806
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,731
Hello friends!

807
01:10:55,261 --> 01:10:58,481
This is my beloved girlfriend.

808
01:11:03,194 --> 01:11:06,069
What is this Sunil?  This cat...

809
01:11:06,404 --> 01:11:08,536
From England...

810
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:10,730
Be with you, my dear.

811
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:18,859
Welcome!

812
01:11:19,677 --> 01:11:21,015
Miss, wants to talk to you.

813
01:11:22,552 --> 01:11:24,710
- Who are you?
- You don't know me?

814
01:11:25,701 --> 01:11:27,573
I am the groom of this party.

815
01:11:28,427 --> 01:11:29,805
Anita's boyfriend.

816
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:31,510
got it

817
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:38,854
What nonsense is this?

818
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:42,260
God, you burned my lips.

819
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:44,284
your lips  My heart is on fire.

820
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,427
Do you work here too?

821
01:11:49,507 --> 01:11:49,985
No.

822
01:11:50,332 --> 01:11:54,237
You are like Dev Anand.

823
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:58,043
A cold drink, right?

824
01:11:58,802 --> 01:11:59,885
Give it to me.

825
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,563
who wants  Come here and drink.

826
01:12:01,845 --> 01:12:03,199
What nonsense is this?

827
01:12:03,881 --> 01:12:06,011
Even a boy talks like a girl.

828
01:12:06,346 --> 01:12:07,719
Those girls are Sunil.

829
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:09,635
Are these girls?

830
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,693
What a beautiful statue this is.

831
01:12:16,773 --> 01:12:18,011
Why is this?

832
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:21,905
No ma'am.  Women of India
cannot be allowed to be like this.

833
01:12:24,314 --> 01:12:27,767
Ladies and gentlemen, dinner
is now served.  please come

834
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:28,879
thank you.

835
01:12:28,948 --> 01:12:31,849
Come, hurry and let us eat.

836
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:36,261
I'm hungry.  I eat a lot.

837
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:38,641
aunt  Aren't you hungry?

838
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:41,306
- Why is this?
- I'm very hungry.

839
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:51,633
Why is this, no bread?

840
01:12:51,657 --> 01:12:53,201
He will bring it up later.
Drink the soup first.

841
01:12:53,225 --> 01:12:55,344
Soap...?  Are you telling me to drink soap?

842
01:12:55,427 --> 01:12:56,845
It's not soap, it's soup.

843
01:12:56,925 --> 01:12:58,220
Oh god Sunil.

844
01:12:58,934 --> 01:12:59,934
ok dear

845
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:07,313
It is very hot.
Waiter, bring some ice.

846
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,588
see!  My girlfriend's
cheek is red.

847
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:14,045
Drink hot.

848
01:13:20,072 --> 01:13:24,064
God has given us a hand.
Why not eat them?

849
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:25,372
I eat with my hands.

850
01:13:26,136 --> 01:13:28,472
Sunil, maintain table manners.

851
01:13:28,927 --> 01:13:30,121
Please Sunil...

852
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,340
ok

853
01:13:50,141 --> 01:13:52,806
This one, dead, still flies.

854
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,529
Enough of these jokes.

855
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:56,427
- Do you want to eat both?
- Sunil.

856
01:13:56,623 --> 01:13:58,174
So why don't you
make him understand?

857
01:13:58,198 --> 01:13:59,511
sorry  I must leave.

858
01:14:00,591 --> 01:14:02,190
I leave.

859
01:14:07,556 --> 01:14:09,597
Let everyone go.

860
01:14:09,677 --> 01:14:12,689
Let's both eat.  You eat
tomatoes, I eat radishes.

861
01:14:18,144 --> 01:14:20,213
Nothing happened yet, ma'am.

862
01:14:20,734 --> 01:14:22,679
This is only the first scene of the play.

863
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,506
Wait for the falling scene.

864
01:14:31,904 --> 01:14:34,991
Hey guys, enjoy the drink?

865
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,762
Yes of course.

866
01:14:36,842 --> 01:14:38,927
Boss, with every sip…

867
01:14:39,011 --> 01:14:40,990
...Consciousness expands.

868
01:14:43,506 --> 01:14:45,927
There are many aspects to drinking, boss.

869
01:14:46,309 --> 01:14:48,802
But imported alcohol is useless.

870
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:51,559
Until such a moment,
I will drink homemade.

871
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,760
I don't get any character.

872
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:58,123
Give three more to Kallu's glass too.

873
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:00,677
She is here.

874
01:15:01,037 --> 01:15:05,289
- Listen, you remember everything, right?
- Okay.

875
01:15:33,604 --> 01:15:35,011
Why is this Sunil?

876
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:38,215
What kings do.

877
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:39,231
Sunil.

878
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:41,427
Why are you angry?

879
01:15:41,675 --> 01:15:45,605
Come, I will introduce
you to my friends.

880
01:15:54,456 --> 01:15:57,761
They are all my close friends.

881
01:15:58,386 --> 01:16:01,697
Musk, Bablu.

882
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:06,941
Kallan, Anguri.

883
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:10,274
Saida, Bhola, Ramu,
Shyamu and Golu.

884
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:11,985
Meet him too.

885
01:20:41,346 --> 01:20:44,507
I will not go that easily, madam.

886
01:20:44,787 --> 01:20:46,427
i am your boyfriend

887
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:49,327
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go.

888
01:20:49,618 --> 01:20:52,369
My mistake was letting
this man get close to me.

889
01:20:52,592 --> 01:20:53,868
No.  It is not so.

890
01:20:54,465 --> 01:20:56,734
If you hadn't been
poor with him...

891
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,444
...He doesn't do this.

892
01:20:59,536 --> 01:21:00,618
What do you mean?

893
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:04,118
When you first met him...

894
01:21:04,202 --> 01:21:06,998
...was he acting like a brute?

895
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,117
- No
- When you go out with him?

896
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:15,984
- no way.
- Then it is clear that he is not such a person.

897
01:21:16,452 --> 01:21:18,389
He will answer you
in your own language.

898
01:21:18,413 --> 01:21:19,788
His revenge.

899
01:21:19,868 --> 01:21:22,577
Not just because you
played a trick on him.

900
01:21:22,788 --> 01:21:25,268
Because you didn't tell
about the engagement before.

901
01:21:25,962 --> 01:21:27,996
Yes Pisces, that's probably why.

902
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:31,690
But now those things cannot be changed.

903
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:36,809
What happens now?

904
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:38,953
Nothing is impossible in this world.

905
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:42,705
Tell me, what are you doing?

906
01:21:42,786 --> 01:21:45,498
Only a big thing can
destroy a small thing.

907
01:21:46,094 --> 01:21:47,327
I don't understand fish.

908
01:21:47,452 --> 01:21:50,629
Anyway, get used to doing
things that make him jealous.

909
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:52,287
How is that?

910
01:21:52,335 --> 01:21:54,994
Talk to a person close
enough to see him.

911
01:21:55,074 --> 01:21:57,807
Hold his hands and hug him.

912
01:21:58,255 --> 01:22:01,713
But who could be such a person?

913
01:22:05,891 --> 01:22:07,871
- Ramesh.
- No.

914
01:22:07,952 --> 01:22:09,797
Then stay at home.

915
01:22:13,854 --> 01:22:15,655
Then fish.  your...

916
01:22:15,734 --> 01:22:16,559
Anyway this...

917
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,921
No, you have to do this.

918
01:22:31,591 --> 01:22:33,922
your...?  Anita is not here.

919
01:22:34,393 --> 01:22:35,831
She will come here.

920
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,265
Where will she leave me?

921
01:22:39,773 --> 01:22:41,612
So, you can wait for a while.

922
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:43,118
Watch like a watchman…

923
01:22:43,202 --> 01:22:45,192
-...for the rest of your life.
- What do you mean?

924
01:22:45,203 --> 01:22:47,422
you think....

925
01:22:48,153 --> 01:22:50,731
...are you the only one in Anita's life?

926
01:22:51,786 --> 01:22:53,819
Who else is in Anita's life?

927
01:22:54,118 --> 01:22:56,371
Who else could love her?

928
01:22:56,743 --> 01:22:58,800
why is that  For example Ramesh.

929
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,094
Who is her childhood friend?

930
01:23:01,118 --> 01:23:03,634
- Has she gone out with Ramesh?
- Yes.

931
01:23:06,702 --> 01:23:08,829
What is she doing with Ramesh?

932
01:23:09,435 --> 01:23:12,121
work?

933
01:23:12,759 --> 01:23:15,536
Both are young.  Good looking.

934
01:23:16,266 --> 01:23:19,167
- Both need each other.
- It can't be.

935
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:22,750
The impossible is possible.

936
01:23:23,618 --> 01:23:25,688
You don't know about
these, Miss Sunil.

937
01:23:27,118 --> 01:23:28,600
I did not know.

938
01:23:29,716 --> 01:23:31,105
You are so naive.

939
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:34,285
Where did they go?

940
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:37,080
He said he was going to walk on Rajpur Road.

941
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:41,344
Don't go after them.

942
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,568
If you do, you will regret it.

943
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:56,372
Ramesh, you are very handsome.

944
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:59,557
Did you think I was
handsome after days?

945
01:24:00,054 --> 01:24:02,118
I used to look at you
from my perspective.

946
01:24:02,202 --> 01:24:04,461
Today I look at you with my eyes.

947
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:05,803
Foreign women
who care about you.

948
01:24:05,827 --> 01:24:07,380
Instead...

949
01:24:13,868 --> 01:24:15,201
But I know.

950
01:24:15,596 --> 01:24:17,952
Someone must have
held your hand like this.

951
01:24:18,908 --> 01:24:20,628
You must be humble like this.

952
01:24:21,412 --> 01:24:24,226
Someone might have hugged
you like this with his arms.

953
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:29,867
Must have done something like this.

954
01:24:35,452 --> 01:24:36,536
Sunil.

955
01:24:36,786 --> 01:24:37,820
What have you been doing, Anita?

956
01:24:37,844 --> 01:24:39,118
Ramesh you are my friend.

957
01:24:39,202 --> 01:24:41,011
Whatever I do is only
after proper thought.

958
01:24:41,091 --> 01:24:43,837
I'll tell you later, come on.

959
01:24:47,868 --> 01:24:49,612
Mom, pack up.

960
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:52,639
Pack your bags... why?

961
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:54,368
We are not here anymore.

962
01:24:57,498 --> 01:24:58,702
We are leaving this town.

963
01:24:59,792 --> 01:25:02,206
But why all of a sudden?

964
01:25:02,286 --> 01:25:05,208
do not ask.  I made a decision.

965
01:25:05,536 --> 01:25:06,993
What decision?

966
01:25:07,786 --> 01:25:09,362
Why are you talking like crazy?

967
01:25:09,702 --> 01:25:11,869
Your marriage is permanent and
so is Mohini's marriage with Ramesh.

968
01:25:11,948 --> 01:25:14,742
Ramesh....don't even
mention his name in front of me.

969
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:17,456
- Why is that?
- Don't force me.

970
01:25:17,536 --> 01:25:20,011
His changes came about
with the move abroad.

971
01:25:20,091 --> 01:25:22,581
His level now, you
can't even imagine.

972
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:25,413
- No, Ramesh is not such a person.
- He is such a friend.

973
01:25:25,493 --> 01:25:27,795
- What is the evidence?
- My own eyes.

974
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:29,786
And I don't need any more proof.

975
01:25:29,865 --> 01:25:32,331
You may not want to, but I do.

976
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:35,243
- Without knowing how I...
- Be quiet, Mohini.

977
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:38,404
I am responsible for the honor of this family.

978
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:41,405
It is my job to decide what is
good and bad for this family.

979
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:45,310
- Mom, you all want to go to Mumbai with me.
- Mumbai?

980
01:25:46,252 --> 01:25:48,206
Sunil, do you know what
you are talking about?

981
01:25:48,286 --> 01:25:50,782
- I know.
- But, brother.

982
01:25:50,862 --> 01:25:52,238
But there is no need for talk.

983
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:54,432
You must do what I ask of you.

984
01:25:56,702 --> 01:25:57,978
Mother!

985
01:26:00,122 --> 01:26:01,202
Meena!

986
01:26:02,786 --> 01:26:04,027
Joseph.

987
01:26:05,873 --> 01:26:07,456
- Yes, ma'am?
- Where is Mina?

988
01:26:07,536 --> 01:26:08,622
She is not here.

989
01:26:08,702 --> 01:26:10,953
A young woman gave this letter for you.

990
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:12,119
a letter?

991
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:20,962
I know what happened to my brother.

992
01:26:21,358 --> 01:26:24,206
He is not ready to live in Delhi.

993
01:26:24,286 --> 01:26:26,860
He asks us to leave
this city immediately.

994
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:29,054
Only you can stop him.

995
01:26:31,868 --> 01:26:33,578
Even my mother thinks so.

996
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:36,529
Please come to our house anyway.

997
01:26:37,286 --> 01:26:41,016
We are all waiting
for you - Mohini.

998
01:27:21,256 --> 01:27:22,582
A letter from Mohini!

999
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:26,463
So Sunil went to Mumbai.

1000
01:27:34,496 --> 01:27:36,122
Dhand brother, Sunil...

1001
01:27:36,202 --> 01:27:38,286
I know the fool left town.

1002
01:27:38,488 --> 01:27:41,561
- What kind of love did you make?
- A love...?

1003
01:27:41,921 --> 01:27:43,321
I put up with his jokes a lot.

1004
01:27:43,445 --> 01:27:45,365
But he could not tolerate
a single thing from me.

1005
01:27:45,565 --> 01:27:47,178
I befriended Ramesh and
tried to make him jealous.

1006
01:27:47,202 --> 01:27:49,494
- You were burned by that fire.
- Yes.

1007
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,411
Please save me brother Dhand.

1008
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:54,618
- Am I a firefighter?
- You can do something about this.

1009
01:27:54,786 --> 01:27:58,118
believe me!
Ramesh is like a brother to me.

1010
01:27:58,368 --> 01:28:00,168
Sunil misunderstood me.

1011
01:28:00,248 --> 01:28:03,170
Yes, young people are like that.

1012
01:28:03,405 --> 01:28:04,992
I don't know where he went.

1013
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:09,789
- Wherever he goes, somehow find him.
- I think he...

1014
01:28:11,289 --> 01:28:15,118
...Mumbai must have
gone.  He was born there.

1015
01:28:15,202 --> 01:28:16,678
Brother Dhand.

1016
01:28:16,702 --> 01:28:20,012
Be it Mumbai or anywhere else.

1017
01:28:20,091 --> 01:28:21,591
I will find him.  but...

1018
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:24,038
- Yes, what?
- This will cost a lot.

1019
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:25,576
I need thousands of rupees.

1020
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:30,952
I have never been on
anything but a Boeing jet.

1021
01:28:31,032 --> 01:28:33,257
And I have not stayed in
any other hotel except the Taj.

1022
01:28:33,337 --> 01:28:35,662
- Don't worry about money.
- Don't worry about Sunil.

1023
01:28:35,742 --> 01:28:38,079
I will write to you
before I find him.

1024
01:28:38,712 --> 01:28:39,741
Go.

1025
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:42,244
Don't worry.  That's right.

1026
01:28:56,118 --> 01:28:58,708
Great place!

1027
01:29:15,345 --> 01:29:17,119
brother

1028
01:29:17,202 --> 01:29:19,658
I am doomed.  Everything was lost.

1029
01:29:19,738 --> 01:29:20,738
Dhand... you?

1030
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:24,118
Not money.  But not clean…

1031
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:27,268
-...someone belonging to the house or town.
- Why did you come here?

1032
01:29:27,814 --> 01:29:30,268
I haven't come inside the house yet.

1033
01:29:33,006 --> 01:29:35,618
- Listen.
- Who gave you this address?

1034
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:37,048
The address was given...

1035
01:29:38,783 --> 01:29:41,705
Mohini did you write to Ramesh?

1036
01:29:41,786 --> 01:29:44,810
Ramesh...?  I did not write to him.

1037
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:46,786
- Then you should write to Anita.
- No.

1038
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:51,262
- Then?
- You worry about this family.

1039
01:29:51,342 --> 01:29:55,614
And my family...

1040
01:29:55,694 --> 01:29:58,682
- Rani.
- Queen?

1041
01:29:58,911 --> 01:30:00,174
- What happened to Rani?
- Aunt.

1042
01:30:00,198 --> 01:30:02,810
Rani is gone.

1043
01:30:03,789 --> 01:30:04,868
my goodness!  when is that

1044
01:30:05,036 --> 01:30:06,940
- How did she die?
- If she died...

1045
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:10,646
...I distribute sweets.

1046
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:13,769
Rani ran away with a boy.

1047
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,368
My actions bore fruit only for me.

1048
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:18,789
Mom, he is reading nonsense.
I don't believe him.

1049
01:30:18,868 --> 01:30:20,304
Sunil.  If you want
to throw luggage.

1050
01:30:20,328 --> 01:30:22,456
Throw them in.

1051
01:30:22,536 --> 01:30:24,118
I am begging you
touching your feet.

1052
01:30:24,654 --> 01:30:26,489
Even if they are dirty.

1053
01:30:28,243 --> 01:30:31,703
You are like my son.

1054
01:30:31,783 --> 01:30:33,860
That is what people ask God for.

1055
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:35,549
Lucky to have a son
and not a daughter.

1056
01:30:35,573 --> 01:30:37,205
Tell me one thing, Dhand.

1057
01:30:37,286 --> 01:30:39,581
Did Anita or Ramesh
give you this address?

1058
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:42,202
No.  Can't you see,
my stomach is swollen.

1059
01:30:42,286 --> 01:30:45,118
If you open your mouth
about this place, I will stab you.

1060
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:47,118
I never open my
mouth.  if you want.

1061
01:30:47,202 --> 01:30:48,953
You might as well tape my mouth.

1062
01:30:54,786 --> 01:30:56,118
Brother Dhand.

1063
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:57,681
Did you tell him?

1064
01:30:57,761 --> 01:31:00,185
I am not involved
in such matters.

1065
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,879
Get out!  Son, come on.

1066
01:31:05,036 --> 01:31:06,743
where is my room

1067
01:35:46,753 --> 01:35:48,003
- Hello brother Dhand.
- Welcome.

1068
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:50,505
- How is Sunil?
- He is angry.

1069
01:35:50,927 --> 01:35:53,171
But don't worry.
A little effort will be required.

1070
01:35:53,251 --> 01:35:55,757
But everything will be fine.

1071
01:35:55,837 --> 01:35:58,173
Look, I already
did your job, but…

1072
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,283
- But that...
- But what?

1073
01:36:00,363 --> 01:36:03,420
- A lot of money was spent.
- I said don't worry.

1074
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,310
- Money, take as much as you want.
- Good.

1075
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:08,309
Didn't Meena come?

1076
01:36:08,587 --> 01:36:10,027
She will come by plane in the evening.

1077
01:36:10,368 --> 01:36:12,798
- really?
- Of course!

1078
01:36:13,442 --> 01:36:15,421
But why are you asking about her?

1079
01:36:15,503 --> 01:36:18,423
If not me, who else will ask?

1080
01:36:18,503 --> 01:36:20,091
So this is the point.

1081
01:36:20,171 --> 01:36:23,383
But brother Dhand.
She calls you 'Mama'.

1082
01:36:23,462 --> 01:36:27,563
That's the problem Miss Anita, come on.

1083
01:36:32,337 --> 01:36:37,380
Sunil, please listen to me.

1084
01:36:37,671 --> 01:36:39,008
I am innocent.

1085
01:36:39,087 --> 01:36:40,614
- Get out of my way.
- Sunil.

1086
01:36:40,949 --> 01:36:43,291
No matter what I
did, it won you over.

1087
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:45,213
But you left Delhi and came here.

1088
01:36:45,421 --> 01:36:46,921
Ramesh is like a brother to me.

1089
01:36:47,003 --> 01:36:50,332
Don't talk nonsense.
Aren't you ashamed to say so?

1090
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:52,105
I am well aware of the reality.

1091
01:36:52,185 --> 01:36:53,185
Good.

1092
01:36:53,264 --> 01:36:54,858
Trust me Sunil.

1093
01:36:55,154 --> 01:36:57,708
- I never loved anyone else.
- Go away, Anita.

1094
01:36:58,255 --> 01:36:59,337
Sunil.

1095
01:42:21,908 --> 01:42:25,201
Now do you understand
that I am not such a person?

1096
01:42:26,728 --> 01:42:27,828
shall i go

1097
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:31,338
I will be back.

1098
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:34,780
- Really?
- Yes.  I will come.

1099
01:42:35,207 --> 01:42:36,238
come with me

1100
01:42:56,345 --> 01:42:57,345
your...?

1101
01:42:58,962 --> 01:43:01,661
Yes, why are you surprised?

1102
01:43:02,412 --> 01:43:04,098
Can the shadow
ever leave a person?

1103
01:43:04,307 --> 01:43:05,527
So you found me.

1104
01:43:05,923 --> 01:43:06,923
Yes.

1105
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:09,672
Your father had given
me this responsibility.

1106
01:43:10,327 --> 01:43:11,387
you think

1107
01:43:11,805 --> 01:43:14,641
To this day I don't
know what happened.

1108
01:43:15,502 --> 01:43:16,613
And so I thought.

1109
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,737
Because of Sunil and your meeting…

1110
01:43:19,742 --> 01:43:21,817
...he dies a natural death.

1111
01:43:21,841 --> 01:43:25,966
What do you think I should do now?

1112
01:43:26,264 --> 01:43:29,436
Let's stop cheating on both of them.

1113
01:43:29,882 --> 01:43:31,350
You are a puppet in my hands.

1114
01:43:31,688 --> 01:43:33,395
Who can compel me
to dance to the beat?

1115
01:43:34,029 --> 01:43:35,527
I can destroy if I want.

1116
01:43:35,814 --> 01:43:38,095
Don't threaten me and leave here.

1117
01:43:38,393 --> 01:43:40,188
Do something you like.

1118
01:43:48,091 --> 01:43:49,091
Ajith...?

1119
01:43:50,957 --> 01:43:52,644
Ajith will have to do that today.

1120
01:43:53,168 --> 01:43:55,083
Which he should have
done a long time ago.

1121
01:43:55,411 --> 01:43:57,572
You will hate yourself after today.

1122
01:43:57,908 --> 01:43:59,475
You have to hide
your face from Sunil.

1123
01:44:00,101 --> 01:44:01,807
Let me go, you bastard!

1124
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:12,102
Spring!

1125
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:28,248
Spring!

1126
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,140
what's up ma'am

1127
01:44:34,261 --> 01:44:35,338
- Nothing, Vasantha.  go away
- Spring.

1128
01:44:35,362 --> 01:44:36,362
spring

1129
01:44:36,658 --> 01:44:40,268
I am the servant of this house sir.
You get out of here.

1130
01:44:40,349 --> 01:44:41,608
what are you saying?  go away

1131
01:44:41,688 --> 01:44:43,166
Go.

1132
01:44:47,341 --> 01:44:50,742
- Vasantha, don't let him in
- OK, ma'am.

1133
01:44:58,814 --> 01:44:59,875
Hello, madam.

1134
01:45:01,015 --> 01:45:03,335
- Why, what?
- Anita called you.

1135
01:45:03,564 --> 01:45:05,854
- She's in the car.
- Anita?

1136
01:45:05,934 --> 01:45:08,115
Yes.  She called you
because it was important.

1137
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:11,567
Wait, I'll come.

1138
01:45:30,668 --> 01:45:31,978
Is this Anita's bungalow?

1139
01:45:32,057 --> 01:45:35,429
It was me, not Anita,
who told you to come.

1140
01:45:35,516 --> 01:45:37,476
I have something important
to talk to you about.

1141
01:45:37,552 --> 01:45:42,907
- you?
- I will tell you everything.  please come

1142
01:45:46,152 --> 01:45:47,569
You don't know me.

1143
01:45:48,293 --> 01:45:49,889
But I know you.

1144
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:51,833
I am not a stranger.

1145
01:45:52,469 --> 01:45:54,253
Your husband Mr. Hariram.

1146
01:45:55,612 --> 01:45:58,628
A good friend of mine.  please come

1147
01:45:59,966 --> 01:46:01,761
I owe him a lot.

1148
01:46:02,604 --> 01:46:05,153
Instead, today I...

1149
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:07,587
Because he...

1150
01:46:08,326 --> 01:46:10,438
Because of this, it is my duty.

1151
01:46:10,963 --> 01:46:13,753
- I will not allow any harm to happen to you.
- A disaster...?

1152
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:15,368
what disaster

1153
01:46:16,488 --> 01:46:18,920
Your son is going to marry Anita.

1154
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:22,508
She is indeed a very
rich young woman.

1155
01:46:23,033 --> 01:46:24,033
but.

1156
01:46:24,421 --> 01:46:26,871
Wealth is not
everything in this world.

1157
01:46:27,894 --> 01:46:29,619
Do you like this marriage?

1158
01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:31,338
By doing so, will it bring your
family name into disrepute?

1159
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,180
Do you know that your
husband's soul is grieved by this?

1160
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:37,622
- What are you going to say?
- I want to do my duty.

1161
01:46:39,337 --> 01:46:44,207
Anita's mother is...

1162
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:47,916
my mom...?  But she is dead.

1163
01:46:48,136 --> 01:46:49,256
She is alive.

1164
01:46:50,139 --> 01:46:52,390
If you don't believe
me go to this address.

1165
01:46:52,846 --> 01:46:55,077
No. 11/B , Juhu
Road Church, Mumbai.

1166
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:56,921
Go and see for yourself.

1167
01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:01,206
- She is a prostitute.
- Mother!

1168
01:47:01,811 --> 01:47:03,506
You are a whore's daughter.

1169
01:47:04,103 --> 01:47:06,701
I will not let my son fall
even under her shadow.

1170
01:47:39,091 --> 01:47:42,324
Madam, Anita has come to see you.

1171
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:43,812
Anita here...?

1172
01:47:44,337 --> 01:47:45,754
Who gave her my address?

1173
01:47:45,803 --> 01:47:48,243
How did she know I was alive?

1174
01:47:48,296 --> 01:47:50,753
- This is not what I did.
- This is not right Ajit.

1175
01:47:51,253 --> 01:47:52,875
I think you didn't
reveal it to Meena.

1176
01:47:52,954 --> 01:47:54,836
I didn't because of your advice.

1177
01:47:54,917 --> 01:47:57,011
I left her with Anita in Delhi.

1178
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:58,977
So she doesn't know all this.

1179
01:47:59,421 --> 01:48:00,837
As far as I know.

1180
01:48:00,935 --> 01:48:03,635
They know nothing
about their relationship.

1181
01:48:03,636 --> 01:48:05,143
They must not know it.

1182
01:48:05,587 --> 01:48:08,366
Well, there you go.  I will take care of this.

1183
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:25,810
Mother!

1184
01:48:33,894 --> 01:48:36,671
- Then you are alive.
- Does that mean?

1185
01:48:37,837 --> 01:48:42,056
Now you understand it.

1186
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,503
Didn't you lose something?

1187
01:48:46,671 --> 01:48:49,253
What are you talking about, who are you?

1188
01:48:53,332 --> 01:48:56,405
Look at me and try
to recognize who I am.

1189
01:48:56,962 --> 01:48:59,412
I don't know who you are.

1190
01:49:00,344 --> 01:49:03,962
She lost her inheritance.

1191
01:49:04,162 --> 01:49:07,463
Who let you in?

1192
01:49:07,837 --> 01:49:09,171
Get out of here.

1193
01:49:10,837 --> 01:49:12,374
I will go.

1194
01:49:13,186 --> 01:49:15,488
That was after receiving
an answer to my question.

1195
01:49:16,867 --> 01:49:18,543
What is it?

1196
01:49:18,998 --> 01:49:21,503
What inspired you to live this life?

1197
01:49:22,503 --> 01:49:24,443
What trouble did you come here for?

1198
01:49:26,614 --> 01:49:28,916
You sacrificed the greatest asset.

1199
01:49:29,391 --> 01:49:30,753
A woman, her motherhood?

1200
01:49:31,146 --> 01:49:32,675
Lala...!  Khan...!

1201
01:49:32,755 --> 01:49:34,147
Where did they go?

1202
01:49:34,171 --> 01:49:35,753
They don't care.

1203
01:49:35,837 --> 01:49:37,379
Why was anyone allowed in?

1204
01:49:41,926 --> 01:49:43,670
I am nobody, mother.

1205
01:49:44,296 --> 01:49:45,753
I am your daughter.

1206
01:49:46,876 --> 01:49:50,171
Perhaps your heart is
tempted to embrace me.

1207
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:52,003
Get out of here.

1208
01:49:53,847 --> 01:49:57,149
Only once.

1209
01:49:57,912 --> 01:50:00,332
Call me by name.

1210
01:50:01,166 --> 01:50:02,168
Nito...!

1211
01:50:02,783 --> 01:50:03,962
Get out of here.

1212
01:50:04,488 --> 01:50:08,018
You are not the daughter and I
am not your mother, understand?

1213
01:50:08,475 --> 01:50:09,943
Even if you're not my mother.

1214
01:50:10,837 --> 01:50:12,958
Even if it's a lie, tell it once.

1215
01:50:13,831 --> 01:50:16,420
Call me 'Daughter'.

1216
01:50:44,253 --> 01:50:45,693
What's the difference, mom?

1217
01:50:46,764 --> 01:50:50,125
The reason is that she is born from a mother.

1218
01:50:50,204 --> 01:50:51,878
Who does the world call evil?

1219
01:50:52,365 --> 01:50:54,285
It is the parents' sin.
What is wrong with the child?

1220
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:56,313
They have to suffer the consequences of their sins.

1221
01:50:56,337 --> 01:50:58,759
Just face it kids, this
is the rule of this world.

1222
01:50:58,783 --> 01:51:01,936
What world are you
talking about mom?

1223
01:51:02,283 --> 01:51:04,355
This world which is the basis of separation.

1224
01:51:04,613 --> 01:51:06,465
Is Sita pure from Lord Ram?

1225
01:51:06,546 --> 01:51:08,337
I don't want to hear anything.

1226
01:51:08,712 --> 01:51:10,591
The girl who will be my daughter-in-law.

1227
01:51:10,615 --> 01:51:12,336
It is impossible to be the
daughter of such a woman.

1228
01:51:12,579 --> 01:51:14,671
If so, hear me out.

1229
01:51:15,286 --> 01:51:18,378
Can't see your daughter-in-law.

1230
01:51:18,462 --> 01:51:21,178
And her and my future.

1231
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:23,904
Then you cannot be
the mother of this son.

1232
01:51:43,753 --> 01:51:44,836
Hello, sir!

1233
01:51:45,003 --> 01:51:47,671
Madam went to the airport.
Leave this letter to you.

1234
01:51:55,171 --> 01:51:56,253
I leave.

1235
01:51:57,197 --> 01:51:58,862
i loved you

1236
01:51:59,387 --> 01:52:01,253
I tried to win you over.

1237
01:52:01,966 --> 01:52:03,007
But today.

1238
01:52:09,003 --> 01:52:10,463
Driver, take me to the airport.

1239
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:30,337
Anita, stop!

1240
01:52:37,337 --> 01:52:38,337
why this

1241
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:45,855
It is not necessary for you to
marry the daughter of such a woman.

1242
01:52:46,837 --> 01:52:49,277
Who is the world
pointing at you for?

1243
01:52:49,962 --> 01:52:51,337
All people.

1244
01:52:52,546 --> 01:52:54,798
Which world are you referring to?

1245
01:52:55,337 --> 01:52:57,337
I will explain to mother.

1246
01:52:58,003 --> 01:53:00,559
No Sunil.  God leave me.

1247
01:53:01,085 --> 01:53:02,378
There is still time.

1248
01:53:04,171 --> 01:53:05,222
do you want to go

1249
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:08,930
Well, then go.

1250
01:53:38,921 --> 01:53:40,336
This is his photo.

1251
01:53:41,253 --> 01:53:43,671
Yes, your husband's.

1252
01:53:44,462 --> 01:53:45,923
A very old picture.

1253
01:53:47,837 --> 01:53:50,167
Do you know whose
picture is next to this one?

1254
01:53:53,796 --> 01:53:55,443
The person who killed him.

1255
01:53:56,462 --> 01:53:57,625
did you forget

1256
01:54:01,296 --> 01:54:03,494
Do you remember who this person is?

1257
01:54:04,743 --> 01:54:05,920
who

1258
01:54:07,579 --> 01:54:08,789
Anita's father.

1259
01:54:10,188 --> 01:54:14,253
This cannot be.  Why
does Anita's father do that?

1260
01:54:14,423 --> 01:54:17,457
Your husband worked
for Anita's father.

1261
01:54:19,085 --> 01:54:21,325
Anita's mother is a
woman of strange character.

1262
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:24,609
So he got suspicious
about Hariram.

1263
01:54:24,867 --> 01:54:26,727
No.  He is not that kind of man.

1264
01:54:27,171 --> 01:54:28,337
How is this saree?

1265
01:54:28,747 --> 01:54:30,548
This color really suits him.

1266
01:54:30,627 --> 01:54:32,036
Five hundred and fifty were spent.

1267
01:54:32,121 --> 01:54:33,697
Anita let me buy it.

1268
01:54:34,386 --> 01:54:36,254
No need to give this saree to her.

1269
01:54:36,333 --> 01:54:38,570
And this marriage
will not happen.

1270
01:54:41,145 --> 01:54:42,420
What happened mom?

1271
01:54:47,212 --> 01:54:48,292
What's wrong mom?

1272
01:54:49,462 --> 01:54:50,754
you can't say

1273
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:53,500
It is a matter of life
and death for one.

1274
01:54:54,283 --> 01:54:56,837
Some things are more
important than life and death.

1275
01:54:56,921 --> 01:54:58,220
What is that, mom?

1276
01:54:58,557 --> 01:55:02,378
I appeal to you.
Please don't ask me this.

1277
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:04,487
You have to tell me this.

1278
01:55:05,854 --> 01:55:07,471
I can't say that.

1279
01:55:09,108 --> 01:55:11,606
- And you won't be able to hear.
- I'll ask it, mom.

1280
01:55:14,171 --> 01:55:17,837
Would you marry such
a father's daughter?

1281
01:55:17,921 --> 01:55:19,490
whose father

1282
01:55:20,224 --> 01:55:22,891
- Whose father killed your father?
- Mother!

1283
01:55:29,713 --> 01:55:31,091
my dad.

1284
01:55:32,055 --> 01:55:34,146
Anita's father, was our father killed?

1285
01:55:35,253 --> 01:55:37,586
What is the reason?

1286
01:55:38,492 --> 01:55:41,229
I do not know.  Really.
I don't know anything.

1287
01:55:41,309 --> 01:55:43,253
You know it, mom,
but you hide it.

1288
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,216
You'll have to tell me.

1289
01:55:49,143 --> 01:55:51,373
- He had doubts.
- Doubt?

1290
01:55:52,837 --> 01:55:54,279
What is the doubt for?

1291
01:55:55,597 --> 01:55:56,836
Sunil is my son.

1292
01:55:59,505 --> 01:56:04,841
It's better if you don't ask.

1293
01:56:04,921 --> 01:56:07,253
Your late father's
name will not be insulted.

1294
01:56:12,127 --> 01:56:14,735
Your father was
working in his office.

1295
01:56:16,503 --> 01:56:18,731
Anita's father became suspicious.

1296
01:56:21,201 --> 01:56:23,957
- That's his wife.  With your father...
- Mom!

1297
01:56:24,632 --> 01:56:26,030
No, mom.

1298
01:56:27,503 --> 01:56:30,662
Do you also consider it
true, mother, about my father?

1299
01:56:30,851 --> 01:56:34,878
I don't know anything.

1300
01:56:34,958 --> 01:56:36,425
We will have to find out.

1301
01:56:36,505 --> 01:56:38,837
We will have to get to
the root of this matter.

1302
01:56:40,546 --> 01:56:42,820
Mother.  Give me the
address of Anita's mother.

1303
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,320
No, Sunil.

1304
01:56:45,806 --> 01:56:48,782
You are not conscious now Sunil.

1305
01:56:49,587 --> 01:56:51,427
- What are you doing, son?
- Go, mom.

1306
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:54,683
Sunil.  wait  Sunil don't go.

1307
01:56:59,885 --> 01:57:01,318
- Khan.
- Yes, sir.

1308
01:57:01,398 --> 01:57:02,837
- Where is madam?
- Upstairs, sir.

1309
01:57:13,378 --> 01:57:14,753
who are you

1310
01:57:17,837 --> 01:57:19,837
how did you get here

1311
01:57:20,667 --> 01:57:21,787
Don't come forward.

1312
01:57:22,378 --> 01:57:24,069
Don't you love your life?

1313
01:57:25,087 --> 01:57:27,939
- No.
- Get out of here.

1314
01:57:28,128 --> 01:57:29,614
- Khan.
- Don't shout.

1315
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:33,155
- I want to ask you something.
- What do you want to hear?

1316
01:57:33,552 --> 01:57:34,586
What is that for?

1317
01:57:34,783 --> 01:57:37,098
Because the issues related to
this are also related to many lives.

1318
01:57:37,122 --> 01:57:39,586
To you, to your daughter, to me.

1319
01:57:39,667 --> 01:57:43,193
what daughter  I don't have a daughter.

1320
01:57:43,462 --> 01:57:45,699
I knew you would say this.

1321
01:57:46,532 --> 01:57:49,755
- Anita, the owner of Empire Stores, is your daughter, right?
- No.

1322
01:57:49,983 --> 01:57:53,077
- Isn't Vishwanath your husband?
- No.

1323
01:57:53,394 --> 01:57:55,805
Your husband kicked you out.

1324
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:58,461
That's why you
had to live this life.

1325
01:57:58,508 --> 01:58:00,397
- That's wrong.
- So is this also wrong?

1326
01:58:00,421 --> 01:58:02,397
You, that she had an affair
with her partner Hariram.

1327
01:58:02,421 --> 01:58:05,514
A blatant lie.  I had
nothing to do with Hariram.

1328
01:58:06,753 --> 01:58:09,003
That means you knew
Hariram, didn't you?

1329
01:58:10,957 --> 01:58:13,670
- And Vishwanath is your husband.
- Get out of here.

1330
01:58:13,983 --> 01:58:15,114
Get out of here for God's sake.

1331
01:58:15,194 --> 01:58:16,760
Anita is really your daughter.

1332
01:58:23,542 --> 01:58:25,253
That is not right.

1333
01:58:26,587 --> 01:58:29,523
Forcing me to tell the secret.

1334
01:58:31,615 --> 01:58:33,332
It is buried deep in my heart.

1335
01:58:34,779 --> 01:58:38,041
- Who are you?
- My name is Sunil.

1336
01:58:38,597 --> 01:58:40,720
I am Hariram's son.

1337
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:44,133
- Hariram's son?
- Yes.

1338
01:58:45,402 --> 01:58:47,176
And Anita's boyfriend.

1339
01:58:51,128 --> 01:58:54,873
I came here so I
could see that woman.

1340
01:58:55,171 --> 01:58:57,619
Who destroyed, not only my clan.

1341
01:58:57,978 --> 01:59:00,675
Her and her daughter.

1342
01:59:01,171 --> 01:59:02,917
Trust me son.

1343
01:59:03,462 --> 01:59:06,408
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- It's really your fault.

1344
01:59:06,894 --> 01:59:09,989
You didn't come out lying
to yourself all the time.

1345
01:59:10,395 --> 01:59:11,863
What proof do you have of this?

1346
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:14,560
What is said now is true?

1347
01:59:15,046 --> 01:59:17,337
All I have is memory, son.

1348
01:59:18,671 --> 01:59:20,337
No other evidence.

1349
01:59:23,039 --> 01:59:24,461
I became a mother.

1350
01:59:25,671 --> 01:59:27,257
So I left home.

1351
01:59:28,057 --> 01:59:30,297
It's not right but it's a
blemish on my character.

1352
01:59:30,518 --> 01:59:32,957
My growing daughter
cannot tolerate its humiliation.

1353
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:36,943
If this is correct...

1354
01:59:37,331 --> 01:59:40,003
..Why are you going
back to your daughter?

1355
01:59:40,851 --> 01:59:42,507
No, I'm not going there.

1356
01:59:43,503 --> 01:59:45,224
Wait for him.

1357
01:59:46,106 --> 01:59:48,546
And with both hands
he pushed me out...

1358
01:59:49,112 --> 01:59:50,551
...want me back.

1359
01:59:51,462 --> 01:59:53,009
I will not enter that house.

1360
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:55,984
Is your husband alive?

1361
01:59:57,253 --> 02:00:00,060
Yes, spent time in
solitary confinement.

1362
02:00:00,605 --> 02:00:02,405
He was transferred
to a nearby prison.

1363
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:04,592
He will be released in a day or two.

1364
02:00:07,091 --> 02:00:08,711
Catch the young man coming now.

1365
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:10,890
Finish him off.

1366
02:00:12,003 --> 02:00:16,671
Make it a secret.

1367
02:00:17,676 --> 02:00:18,676
got it

1368
02:00:24,101 --> 02:00:25,253
Why did you go there?

1369
02:04:36,694 --> 02:04:38,254
the boss

1370
02:04:42,167 --> 02:04:44,122
I feel like shooting all of you.

1371
02:04:44,418 --> 02:04:45,797
Donkeys!

1372
02:04:46,076 --> 02:04:49,090
- Boss, we didn't know that Minu would trick us.
- Shut up!

1373
02:05:08,198 --> 02:05:11,164
Anita!

1374
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:15,627
Sunil!

1375
02:05:16,667 --> 02:05:17,667
where is he?

1376
02:05:18,003 --> 02:05:21,878
- He, who is that?
- You don't seem to know.

1377
02:05:22,648 --> 02:05:23,729
your father

1378
02:05:24,878 --> 02:05:28,291
- He...
- Don't talk like that.

1379
02:05:29,243 --> 02:05:31,058
I know everything now.

1380
02:05:31,773 --> 02:05:33,337
He is there.

1381
02:05:34,541 --> 02:05:35,541
Alive...?

1382
02:05:36,829 --> 02:05:37,829
No, Sunil.

1383
02:05:38,039 --> 02:05:40,162
I met your mother today.

1384
02:05:41,154 --> 02:05:43,254
She had to accept that
Vishwanath was her husband.

1385
02:05:43,337 --> 02:05:44,764
Her husband and your father.

1386
02:05:45,161 --> 02:05:47,878
And she told me he was
sentenced to life in prison.

1387
02:05:49,229 --> 02:05:52,171
My father was sentenced
to life imprisonment, why?

1388
02:05:52,461 --> 02:05:55,139
He killed my father.

1389
02:05:55,625 --> 02:05:57,449
I went to see him today.

1390
02:05:57,846 --> 02:05:59,326
He has already been released from there.

1391
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,851
- where is he?
- I do not know.

1392
02:06:02,307 --> 02:06:04,152
- I don't know anything.
- You know.

1393
02:06:04,231 --> 02:06:05,908
But it is not revealed.

1394
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:14,998
I swear by you.

1395
02:06:15,078 --> 02:06:17,340
- He didn't come here.
- I will find him.

1396
02:06:17,421 --> 02:06:19,684
Take revenge for that father's murder.

1397
02:06:19,764 --> 02:06:20,764
Sunil.

1398
02:06:26,377 --> 02:06:27,461
Mother.

1399
02:06:28,744 --> 02:06:29,860
Mother.

1400
02:06:31,002 --> 02:06:32,031
were are you?

1401
02:06:33,122 --> 02:06:34,253
why?

1402
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:39,259
did you come back

1403
02:06:40,175 --> 02:06:42,095
Please don't talk to your
own daughter like this.

1404
02:06:42,518 --> 02:06:44,617
- Sunil told me everything.
- Sunil...?

1405
02:06:44,675 --> 02:06:48,927
- Did he come here now?
- No.

1406
02:06:49,943 --> 02:06:52,422
Where is father now?

1407
02:06:53,761 --> 02:06:54,761
father...?

1408
02:06:54,863 --> 02:06:57,253
I thought he would
come straight to you...

1409
02:06:57,337 --> 02:07:00,157
...released from prison.

1410
02:07:00,417 --> 02:07:02,414
Has he been released?

1411
02:07:02,921 --> 02:07:05,921
where is he  He
didn't come here.

1412
02:07:06,505 --> 02:07:09,462
So, where did he go?

1413
02:07:10,462 --> 02:07:11,476
Nito.

1414
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:20,164
Mom, again...

1415
02:07:20,884 --> 02:07:22,978
Call me by that name again.

1416
02:07:23,251 --> 02:07:26,547
- I always wanted to hear that.
- Nito.

1417
02:07:28,841 --> 02:07:30,253
my child

1418
02:07:31,345 --> 02:07:34,128
Nito.

1419
02:07:34,208 --> 02:07:35,253
Mother.

1420
02:07:35,462 --> 02:07:37,382
come close to my heart

1421
02:07:38,171 --> 02:07:39,626
Put out that fire.

1422
02:07:40,295 --> 02:07:42,699
I was burned by it for years.

1423
02:07:43,654 --> 02:07:47,100
Oh, I'm sorry, I spoke to
you very rudely that day.

1424
02:07:47,646 --> 02:07:49,604
You said nothing, daughter.

1425
02:07:49,864 --> 02:07:53,027
That's what I told
myself after you left.

1426
02:07:53,572 --> 02:07:54,878
But Nito.

1427
02:07:55,134 --> 02:07:57,478
You were an arm's length away from me.

1428
02:07:57,676 --> 02:07:59,597
But I couldn't even reach out.

1429
02:08:00,056 --> 02:08:01,253
I was helpless.

1430
02:08:01,854 --> 02:08:03,961
I know.  That's enough.

1431
02:08:04,729 --> 02:08:06,003
Don't say anything now.

1432
02:08:06,255 --> 02:08:07,546
This is enough for me...

1433
02:08:07,878 --> 02:08:09,253
...I got my mom.

1434
02:08:10,234 --> 02:08:12,506
Anu, why did you come here?

1435
02:08:12,587 --> 02:08:15,466
I went to your house.
Why did you come here?

1436
02:08:15,653 --> 02:08:18,157
This is my home, she is my mother.

1437
02:08:19,668 --> 02:08:20,753
Your mother?

1438
02:08:22,594 --> 02:08:23,594
my sister

1439
02:08:25,867 --> 02:08:28,286
She is not only your
mother but also mine.

1440
02:08:32,426 --> 02:08:35,389
Anu, my sister.

1441
02:08:36,417 --> 02:08:37,417
Fish.

1442
02:08:38,636 --> 02:08:40,336
The first time I met you...

1443
02:08:40,744 --> 02:08:42,753
...my heart has said a thousand times.

1444
02:08:43,386 --> 02:08:45,828
- Even knowing that, Ajit...
- Don't even mention his name.

1445
02:08:46,386 --> 02:08:48,581
Today he tried to kill Sunil.

1446
02:08:49,399 --> 02:08:51,122
Tried to kill Sunil...?

1447
02:08:51,543 --> 02:08:54,590
- Ajit is not such a person.
- No, he's a murderer.

1448
02:08:54,865 --> 02:08:56,466
If I didn't save Sunil today...

1449
02:08:56,725 --> 02:08:57,845
...Ajith, kills him.

1450
02:08:58,002 --> 02:09:00,456
- What are you talking about fish?
- I'm right.

1451
02:09:00,953 --> 02:09:02,337
He is such a person.

1452
02:09:02,421 --> 02:09:04,510
Tried to use one
sister against the other.

1453
02:09:04,806 --> 02:09:06,679
- Who?
- Forget all this.

1454
02:09:08,167 --> 02:09:09,704
Today is a good day.

1455
02:09:11,403 --> 02:09:13,754
Your father was released
from prison today.

1456
02:09:15,531 --> 02:09:17,825
Seeing his daughters grow up.

1457
02:09:18,483 --> 02:09:20,144
He will be very happy.

1458
02:09:26,168 --> 02:09:28,760
When the whole world changes,
Ninety must also change.

1459
02:09:29,168 --> 02:09:30,471
How does she look?

1460
02:09:31,463 --> 02:09:33,434
- dear
- Really?

1461
02:09:34,564 --> 02:09:38,554
I wanted to see him grow up.

1462
02:09:39,001 --> 02:09:41,219
You didn't tell him I
was alive, did you?

1463
02:09:41,442 --> 02:09:43,753
How can I tell her about
it without your advice, sir?

1464
02:09:44,691 --> 02:09:46,671
It's good, but...

1465
02:09:47,711 --> 02:09:51,149
After so many years, she
must have forgotten me.

1466
02:09:51,448 --> 02:09:54,472
- How is that, sir?
- How stupid am I?

1467
02:09:54,552 --> 02:09:56,503
Can blood forget
its own relations?

1468
02:09:58,254 --> 02:10:02,630
At first she would look at me as a stranger.

1469
02:10:03,496 --> 02:10:05,253
Next...

1470
02:10:06,671 --> 02:10:07,974
her blood

1471
02:10:08,754 --> 02:10:10,131
And my blood.

1472
02:10:20,421 --> 02:10:23,707
Mr. Checker, the train that just passed...

1473
02:10:24,153 --> 02:10:27,054
...I saw a murder in it.

1474
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:29,539
She is like a sister to me.

1475
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:31,901
A small thing is
stretched to a giant size.

1476
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:32,980
shut up

1477
02:10:33,129 --> 02:10:35,837
The station is near.  I
will report it to the police.

1478
02:10:36,086 --> 02:10:39,697
Yes, let's go.  I also want
to see what the problem is.

1479
02:10:59,542 --> 02:11:01,256
Sir, we got this purse.

1480
02:11:01,336 --> 02:11:03,361
This is the ID card.

1481
02:11:14,022 --> 02:11:16,087
Aunty!

1482
02:11:16,166 --> 02:11:20,493
Where is the aunt!

1483
02:11:20,574 --> 02:11:22,546
A big problem has arisen.

1484
02:11:22,629 --> 02:11:24,312
- why?
- Don't ask, aunty.

1485
02:11:24,336 --> 02:11:26,253
Sunset occurs only in the evening.

1486
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,570
A murder!  There were a lot of
people at the station at that time.

1487
02:11:28,650 --> 02:11:30,961
By Sunil, someone has been killed.

1488
02:11:31,143 --> 02:11:33,879
Sunil...?  Come on, it's over.

1489
02:11:34,121 --> 02:11:39,337
I thought  He will do
something like this.

1490
02:11:39,709 --> 02:11:41,575
You know brother Dhand's habit.

1491
02:11:41,656 --> 02:11:43,462
He creates a mountain
out of something small.

1492
02:11:43,546 --> 02:11:46,256
Mohini, today I am saying a
small amount of this big thing.

1493
02:11:46,336 --> 02:11:49,005
Sunil has...

1494
02:11:49,911 --> 02:11:52,336
Look, he's here.
Hey Sunil what did you do?

1495
02:11:52,461 --> 02:11:55,280
- What did I do?
- You killed someone on the train.

1496
02:11:55,715 --> 02:11:57,238
- A murder...?
- Yes, the police met...

1497
02:11:57,318 --> 02:11:59,961
...your wallet with your photo on it.

1498
02:12:06,081 --> 02:12:09,254
- Brother, you run away!
- They're coming here to get you.

1499
02:12:09,334 --> 02:12:12,337
- Run.
- Son.

1500
02:13:17,494 --> 02:13:19,906
dhand...

1501
02:13:19,986 --> 02:13:21,337
Who...?

1502
02:13:21,421 --> 02:13:23,443
- Speak slowly, I am Sunil.
- Sunil, you?

1503
02:13:23,523 --> 02:13:26,006
Why did you come here?  The police are looking for you.

1504
02:13:26,086 --> 02:13:27,869
I came here with
great difficulty.

1505
02:13:28,167 --> 02:13:29,407
I don't worry about myself.

1506
02:13:29,519 --> 02:13:31,671
But what does Anita think?

1507
02:13:32,171 --> 02:13:34,811
I also said that I will take
revenge on her father.

1508
02:13:34,879 --> 02:13:37,328
So you did it.  What
else do you want?

1509
02:13:37,652 --> 02:13:40,229
- I did not commit this murder, Dhand.
- do not lie.

1510
02:13:40,775 --> 02:13:43,255
I swear by your friendship.
I did not commit that murder.

1511
02:13:44,704 --> 02:13:46,751
There is some truth in your story.

1512
02:13:47,667 --> 02:13:50,965
Sunil, a woman was in that compartment.

1513
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:53,591
She witnessed the
murder on a passing train.

1514
02:13:53,671 --> 02:13:55,872
A woman... where is she?

1515
02:13:56,421 --> 02:13:58,798
Find her address
or take me to her.

1516
02:13:59,671 --> 02:14:01,879
My photo is at home.

1517
02:14:02,086 --> 02:14:03,570
Show it to that woman.

1518
02:14:03,917 --> 02:14:05,801
If she says that
I did the murder.

1519
02:14:06,137 --> 02:14:07,872
I surrender to the police.

1520
02:14:09,272 --> 02:14:10,461
is it?

1521
02:14:11,393 --> 02:14:13,341
Throughout life...

1522
02:14:13,421 --> 02:14:15,123
...I haven't done anything worthwhile.

1523
02:14:15,203 --> 02:14:18,707
Now I have a chance to
repay you for all your help.

1524
02:14:18,787 --> 02:14:21,086
I will take your
photo to that lady.

1525
02:14:21,166 --> 02:14:22,438
But where will you meet me?

1526
02:14:23,504 --> 02:14:26,257
Dhand, huts near Juhu beach.

1527
02:14:26,336 --> 02:14:30,197
- I will meet you only there.
- Well, go now.

1528
02:14:39,619 --> 02:14:41,974
Hello, this is Anita.

1529
02:14:42,384 --> 02:14:45,336
- Anita, this is Dhand.
- Yes?

1530
02:14:45,692 --> 02:14:47,725
I called you to say something.

1531
02:14:47,806 --> 02:14:50,254
Sunil came to me while
hiding from the police.

1532
02:14:50,336 --> 02:14:51,990
He told me everything.

1533
02:14:52,070 --> 02:14:55,647
He sure didn't kill your father.

1534
02:14:55,859 --> 02:14:57,879
Look Anita, please
don't misunderstand him.

1535
02:14:58,845 --> 02:15:00,253
I can't believe it.

1536
02:15:00,586 --> 02:15:02,490
I have already given a
statement to the police.

1537
02:15:02,713 --> 02:15:04,512
That Sunil threatened me.

1538
02:15:04,846 --> 02:15:07,171
I will kill my father to take revenge.

1539
02:15:08,171 --> 02:15:09,851
You should not have done that.

1540
02:15:10,029 --> 02:15:11,106
OK, never mind.

1541
02:15:11,354 --> 02:15:13,394
The real culprit will
be found in a few days.

1542
02:15:13,421 --> 02:15:18,619
Until then I ask you not
to misunderstand him.

1543
02:15:46,907 --> 02:15:48,816
You may have already
seen the photo, ma'am.

1544
02:15:48,897 --> 02:15:51,712
Now tell me this
photo of the killer?

1545
02:15:52,957 --> 02:15:54,370
No.  He is not.

1546
02:15:54,450 --> 02:15:57,337
Then save him.
Give your statement.

1547
02:15:57,504 --> 02:15:59,337
If this innocent person is given the death penalty.

1548
02:15:59,416 --> 02:16:01,256
I will die too.

1549
02:16:01,336 --> 02:16:03,194
I don't mind, I can testify.

1550
02:16:03,274 --> 02:16:05,078
But my husband...

1551
02:16:05,158 --> 02:16:07,256
...a real coward, like a rat.

1552
02:16:07,336 --> 02:16:10,341
- He doesn't let me get into any trouble.
- Trouble...?

1553
02:16:10,421 --> 02:16:11,549
what are you saying

1554
02:16:11,629 --> 02:16:14,836
Dr. Modi.  Do this for God.

1555
02:16:14,915 --> 02:16:17,798
go out  My son can't sleep
because of this disturbance.

1556
02:16:17,879 --> 02:16:20,986
- Seen, didn't I say?
- You are right ma'am.

1557
02:16:21,066 --> 02:16:22,882
Your husband is right.

1558
02:16:22,962 --> 02:16:24,673
In fact, I am the only one who is wrong.

1559
02:16:24,754 --> 02:16:27,087
It was really a mistake to come to Mumbai.

1560
02:16:27,171 --> 02:16:29,297
One does not care
about the death of another.

1561
02:16:29,321 --> 02:16:32,249
Looking away.

1562
02:16:32,402 --> 02:16:34,708
I am really shocked.

1563
02:16:43,336 --> 02:16:47,564
Please catch him.

1564
02:16:47,762 --> 02:16:52,671
Oh my God.
He is dead.  He is cold.

1565
02:16:52,754 --> 02:16:54,284
Just like ice.

1566
02:16:54,363 --> 02:16:56,055
- What could have happened?
- do not know.

1567
02:16:56,136 --> 02:16:57,432
There is no other witness here.

1568
02:16:57,512 --> 02:16:59,204
We will now be trapped in his death.

1569
02:16:59,284 --> 02:17:02,171
Without witnesses, even
the innocent go to the gallows.

1570
02:17:02,254 --> 02:17:04,341
This is what I was going to say.

1571
02:17:04,421 --> 02:17:07,341
If your wife didn't testify...

1572
02:17:07,421 --> 02:17:11,005
...An innocent man goes to the gallows.

1573
02:17:11,085 --> 02:17:12,951
- My God, are you alive?
- Yes.

1574
02:17:13,031 --> 02:17:14,757
- I will give my testimony.
- No.

1575
02:17:14,792 --> 02:17:17,337
You keep quiet.  If I
don't give my testimony...

1576
02:17:17,416 --> 02:17:19,392
-...he will die again.
- Yes, of course.

1577
02:17:19,416 --> 02:17:22,521
Let her testify.

1578
02:17:36,704 --> 02:17:37,920
Sunil.

1579
02:17:38,266 --> 02:17:39,461
Sunil

1580
02:17:43,931 --> 02:17:45,674
Ma'am, this is Sunil.

1581
02:17:45,754 --> 02:17:47,713
There was a photo in today's paper.

1582
02:17:47,792 --> 02:17:49,272
Identify him, is he a murderer?

1583
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:52,847
- No
- Listen!

1584
02:17:52,961 --> 02:17:54,756
Dhand, will take you to that place now.

1585
02:17:54,839 --> 02:17:57,462
Where the murderer lives.
If you recognize him…

1586
02:17:57,546 --> 02:17:59,365
...the whole matter is settled.

1587
02:17:59,445 --> 02:18:01,961
- Let's go.
- Well, let's go.

1588
02:18:02,217 --> 02:18:03,345
Go quickly.

1589
02:18:11,291 --> 02:18:15,393
Yes, I know.

1590
02:18:16,171 --> 02:18:17,671
what do you want

1591
02:18:17,911 --> 02:18:19,336
I want from your store.

1592
02:18:19,421 --> 02:18:21,381
100 mixed fruit tins,
200 cigarette packets...

1593
02:18:21,421 --> 02:18:24,680
-...or 300 packets.
- Yes.

1594
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:26,974
But this is my home.  Go to the store.

1595
02:18:27,054 --> 02:18:29,256
The queen of the city is with me.

1596
02:18:29,336 --> 02:18:32,256
She wants to deal with you.

1597
02:18:32,336 --> 02:18:34,878
Queen, please come.

1598
02:18:35,879 --> 02:18:39,337
No.

1599
02:18:39,977 --> 02:18:42,086
That's him.

1600
02:18:42,171 --> 02:18:45,382
Soon, I will be back.

1601
02:19:09,048 --> 02:19:10,077
A big problem.

1602
02:19:10,156 --> 02:19:14,403
- Madam, he said that he was the murderer in advance.
- Now...?

1603
02:19:14,484 --> 02:19:16,671
I was a trouble free person.

1604
02:19:16,751 --> 02:19:18,461
Now that murderer
won't spare me.

1605
02:19:18,541 --> 02:19:20,336
Don't worry, doctor.

1606
02:19:21,086 --> 02:19:22,977
Madam will not be harmed
as long as I am there.

1607
02:19:23,001 --> 02:19:24,531
who are you

1608
02:19:25,171 --> 02:19:29,688
I am the one accused of murder.

1609
02:19:37,546 --> 02:19:43,372
- I am Modi to Doc.
- Docta Modi, I am Narang.

1610
02:19:43,683 --> 02:19:49,921
Where should I come?  No.
10, Dadabai Navroji Road?

1611
02:19:50,501 --> 02:19:52,372
Now it is 9.30.

1612
02:19:52,558 --> 02:19:56,996
I will come at 10.
thank you  Welcome.

1613
02:21:50,171 --> 02:21:51,256
Who...?

1614
02:21:51,951 --> 02:21:53,909
- He is.
- Does that mean?

1615
02:21:54,518 --> 02:21:56,254
Who did you meet that day?

1616
02:21:57,058 --> 02:21:58,967
why did you come here

1617
02:21:59,835 --> 02:22:01,336
to meet you

1618
02:22:02,041 --> 02:22:04,930
- To reach a decision.
- A decision... with me?

1619
02:22:05,278 --> 02:22:07,063
Yes.

1620
02:22:07,143 --> 02:22:09,046
It is with you.

1621
02:22:09,677 --> 02:22:11,878
He must have seen it all with his own eyes.

1622
02:22:11,959 --> 02:22:14,171
Murder on the train?

1623
02:22:14,251 --> 02:22:18,479
- Yes.
- I promise not to tell anyone.

1624
02:22:18,727 --> 02:22:20,336
You already said it.

1625
02:22:20,934 --> 02:22:22,336
A proof like you.

1626
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:25,671
Cannot be kept alive.

1627
02:22:26,041 --> 02:22:30,070
Get out of here.  I am
alone in this house now.

1628
02:22:30,504 --> 02:22:31,942
I know.

1629
02:22:39,504 --> 02:22:41,462
- your...?
- yes I'm.

1630
02:22:42,245 --> 02:22:43,633
I know everything now.

1631
02:25:43,295 --> 02:25:44,720
Leave him alone!

1632
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:48,799
- Mother.
- Leave me alone.

1633
02:26:04,197 --> 02:26:06,825
Take him to the police station.

1634
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:19,521
Mother, get him married soon.

1635
02:26:19,545 --> 02:26:22,341
And send her to our house.

1636
02:26:22,424 --> 02:26:25,202
You can get married soon, right?

1637
02:26:28,808 --> 02:26:31,086
There will be dozens of marriages.

1638
02:26:31,338 --> 02:26:33,224
What do you think about marriage?

1639
02:26:33,304 --> 02:26:36,461
marriage?  Do you know
how old you are, uncle?

1640
02:26:36,671 --> 02:26:38,674
bless you!

1641
02:26:38,754 --> 02:26:41,282
Call me by any other name than uncle.

1642
02:26:41,361 --> 02:26:43,884
Okay, I'm not talking to you like that.

1643
02:26:44,654 --> 02:26:45,879
uncle

1644
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:50,254
She called me uncle again.

1645
02:26:50,334 --> 02:26:53,332
How would you feel if
she called you "uncle" too?
