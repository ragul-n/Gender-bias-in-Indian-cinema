00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,238
Greetings madam

3
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:20,185
My eldest son
Bharathasimha Reddy

4
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:21,914
Greetings.- Greetings

5
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,422
My second son
Vijayasimha Reddy

6
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:27,651
Greetings.- Greetings

7
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,341
He's my eldest son's
son Indrasena Reddy

8
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:51,683
He may be a little boy,
but he's an avenger.

9
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,012
Did you observe he
never greeted you?

10
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,225
Have you come to compromise
or with handcuffs?

11
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,791
To compromise.

12
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,696
Human life is very valuable.

13
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:08,961
Both sides have lost
too many lives.

14
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:13,299
Don't beat around the bush,
come to the point straight.

15
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:16,840
If you get your
second son Vijayasimha Reddy,

16
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,471
married to Siva Reddy's sister...

17
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:21,041
Stop!

18
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:25,042
Do you want me to marry my
father's killer's daughter.

19
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,309
I'll cut your tongue.

20
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:29,815
Trust me madam.

21
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:32,484
This marriage will bring
place to this region.

22
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,320
Even if we accept
they'll not accept.

23
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:35,927
I'll make them accept.
- No.

24
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,158
We too like enmity
than relationship.

25
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:43,325
No, your father always wished
peace for this region

26
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,399
Let him make his try.

27
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:51,200
Bring bombs!
I'll stuff it into his mouth.

28
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:52,406
Brother

29
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,546
Did you here what
he said now?

30
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,879
He has brought a proposal from
your father's killer.

31
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:06,185
I like D.I.G.'s proposal.

32
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,022
What happened to you, dear?

33
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:13,859
I feel this will do good
for our family. Accept!

34
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:48,398
Marriage brings together
2 families.

35
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:53,570
But our marriage brings friendship
between 2 warring families.

36
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:55,135
Isn't it?

37
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,673
Wife drinking milk after
husband is old tradition.

38
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,805
Husband drinking milk after
wife is new tradition.

39
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:03,681
You drink and give me.

40
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,726
Though I know I would
die along with you.

41
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,063
Do you know why
drank poisoned milk?

42
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,532
I'm Konda Reddy's daughter.

43
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:08,676
I would prefer death along with
you than sleep with you.

44
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,486
Brother! We've been cheated.

45
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:00,696
Not only to jail, I can come anywhere
in this happy moment.

46
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:05,531
I've practically wiped out
Bharathasimha Reddy's family.

47
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,472
Come...come.

48
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,203
Are you police or demons?

49
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,608
Making me believe this marriage
will bring peace.

50
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,940
You've killed my two sons.

51
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:22,878
Siva Reddy is challenging to have
wiped out men in my family.

52
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:26,886
Anyone from our faction come
forward and sit on this chair

53
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,393
Hey Butchi Reddy!

54
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:34,291
Why are you pondering
over it, Venkat Reddy?

55
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:41,234
For peace to this region,
for your happiness,

56
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:47,402
My grandfather, my father,
my husband, my sons...

57
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,740
...they all sacrificed
their lives for you.

58
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:52,745
Isn't there a man here
to sit on that chair?

59
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,443
I'm there, grandma.

60
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,959
Hail Indrasena Reddy!

61
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,040
What's this police
doing here, priest?

62
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,376
Telugu man has been appointed
as Governor of U.P.

63
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,041
Telugu man?
- Yes, Chennakesava Reddy.

64
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,051
He's coming with his family
for a holy dip in River Ganges.

65
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,712
I've been entrusted
to conduct it.

66
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,585
Okay, do it properly.
He's our Telugu man.

67
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,746
Hey, stop.

68
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,412
You are my security men.
- Yes sir.

69
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,750
You are marching ahead.
what if I'm attacked from behind?

70
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,419
Come dear.

71
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:53,156
Stop.

72
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:54,957
Did all of you go behind me?

73
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,159
What if some one attacks
from the front?

74
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,307
What if the attack is aerial?

75
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,941
If they decide to kill,
they'll do it,

76
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,443
whether it is Parliament or
Pentagon, it doesn't matter.

77
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,102
Come.

78
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,373
Greetings sir - Greetings
- Greetings madam

79
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,277
Go & take a holy dip.

80
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,114
Oh No! I can't take
a dip in this water.

81
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:16,778
It's wrong to refuse.

82
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:18,116
Holy Ganges is a
goddess of mercy.

83
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,781
If you give up
anything you love.

84
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,221
She'll fulfill your
unfulfilled wish.

85
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,631
I don't like the marriage
fixed by my mother.

86
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,659
Priest told me to
give up something.

87
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,064
I'm giving up the
groom I don't like.

88
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:36,999
Select a man I like most.

89
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:52,215
Where's your pearl chain?
- Yes, where's it?

90
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:54,884
Did you give up pearl
for priest's order?

91
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:59,555
A chain blessed by Goddess Durga
to marry my nephew.

92
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:03,058
Don't say like that, madam.
She would've made a wish.

93
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:07,165
To fulfill that Holy Ganges would
send it to the place it deserves.

94
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,631
Hail Lord Shiva!

95
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,728
Sankaranarayana, take god's offering.
- Thank you sir.

96
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:16,841
You always offer prayers
for your niece & nephew only.

97
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,901
You never give an opportunity
to offer prayers for you.

98
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,570
I don't have any problem.
Children must be happy.

99
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:23,976
I'll go sir.- Okay.

100
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:28,914
Oh! Sankaranarayana has come.

101
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,749
He'll ask why I haven't
taken a bath yet

102
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:34,654
So, you all are ready
after taking bath

103
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,421
Good! Where's Valmiki?

104
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,094
Come...take this.

105
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:42,257
We are in a queue.
Why are you breaking the line?

106
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,426
Stop Valmiki...
Keep quiet Subbarayudu

107
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:47,937
He's a dumb and moreover a
long time associate of Sankaranarayana.

108
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:51,270
We came much later.
He deserves to get first.

109
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,275
Why did you forget to give me?

110
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,937
Wantonly I forgot.

111
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,276
Take bath & come.
- I've taken bath.

112
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,215
I'm talking about today
not yesterday.

113
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,121
Why have you come
here suddenly?

114
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,283
Trouble again in Ayodhya or
your college is closed for holiday?

115
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:11,897
No, I've come for festival on
grandma's invitation.- Yes.

116
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,962
Okay, good!
Go and have breakfast.

117
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:18,964
What's that new chain?

118
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,138
It fell into my neck as I was
taking a dip in Ganges.

119
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:24,572
Don't remove it.
Wear it son.

120
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:28,913
That is not just a pearl chain.
It is a boon of Ganges.

121
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:30,706
Don't know why she has
presented it to you? Keep it.

122
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,188
Your niece.

123
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,316
I told her to win the classical song
competition in college.

124
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,985
Look, how she's practicing.

125
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,828
How nicely she's singing!

126
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:48,531
Who had trained her?
- Go and see.

127
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:00,509
Why the tape has stopped playing?
- Player is switched off.

128
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,942
Uncle!

129
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:05,510
Are you practicing the
song I taught you?

130
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:07,346
That's why, I am hearing
it from a tape.

131
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,353
If you hear, you'll get sleep.
You can learn only if you sing.

132
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,354
I'm not getting inspired
to sing, uncle.

133
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,686
I'll beat you...you're wrong.

134
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,521
All you must have is
a heart to sing.

135
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:20,359
Any sound from this Kasi,
abode of Lord Shiva,

136
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,366
...it'll turn into music and
inspire us to sing.

137
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:42,780
Isn't there inspiring music
in these chants of saints?

138
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:43,711
Listen...

139
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:51,056
...the conch is singing
your praise, Lord Shiva.

140
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,061
Don't stop it uncle.
Please sing the song.

141
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:06,298
The conch the blowing...

142
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,137
the drums are playing...

143
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:22,218
Let there be sensation
with cadence in music...

144
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:26,484
Let us march forward
unconcerned about time...

145
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:37,337
singing paeans to Lord Shiva....

146
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,276
becoming the ever flowing Ganges...

147
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:45,504
Making an abode here
Lord with his consort Visalakshi...

148
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:52,351
This is holy town of Kasi...

149
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:29,885
Hail Lord Shiva!

150
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:35,897
Lord is dancing in happiness...

151
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:42,070
Drums are playing thunderously...

152
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:09,760
My song will captivate Kasi.

153
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,765
Like the poetry of
Poet Laureate Srinadha...

154
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:18,271
It is the path leading
to liberation...

155
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:21,740
So says the jungle of
little bell...

156
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:27,272
As heart beat chants your
divine name in a trans...

157
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,149
And dance to your
chants rhythmically...

158
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:35,914
Every step here is like
circumambulating you...

159
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:07,822
The lamps lit in the lunar month
is manifestation of Lord...

160
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:11,654
Won't our sorrows vanish if
we float the lamps here?

161
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:06,946
Any rock in this place
is Lord Shiva...

162
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,017
This is not soil but
boon of Lord Shiva...

163
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:15,388
This place stands for eternity...

164
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,890
A heaven that history also
failed to catch up with...

165
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:24,226
Can't you hear the divine
chant in the air?

166
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:29,233
Can't you see the mercy of
Lord in the Ganges?

167
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:33,042
Come, visit and know the
divinity of Kasi.

168
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:59,616
She's my only daughter,
she loves music,

169
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:01,158
and I love my daughter.

170
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:05,292
I don't want her to become great
singers like Lata or Susheela,

171
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:08,500
It's enough if she sings
lullabies to her children.

172
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:14,801
I brought her up away from
sun & dust, in light & air only.

173
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,175
I'm not leaving behind
my daughter here,

174
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,978
...my life...be careful.

175
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:40,998
Hello Pitchaiah, you've been
crying madly all the night.

176
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:44,399
Please control yourself.
How much you love your father?

177
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:45,665
Love? My foot!

178
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,502
My father left just ashes to me
and property to his concubine.

179
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:53,010
What's in it? You got good deeds
and that lady got sins.

180
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,011
Take care of him...please console.
- Mr. Balu!

181
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:02,678
I'll first offer prayers
in the temple and come.

182
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:05,416
We know the priests
of the temple very well.

183
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,218
We'll take care of your
temple visit personally.

184
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:12,363
You must go to a temple with
devotion, not with security.

185
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:16,697
I'll visit on my own and
come to the guesthouse.

186
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,428
You take me to the
university from there.

187
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,372
Do you want taxi?- No.

188
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,541
It's very crowded here.
Come carefully.

189
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:27,237
One moment you're careless,
you'll be robbed.

190
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,379
Why are you whistling?

191
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,881
Just to know if you're
a Telugu man or not

192
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:32,712
I'm also a Telugu man.
Do you want taxi?

193
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,786
No need...you come.
- Keep quiet.

194
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:37,216
We must go to the river Ganges.
- Just Rs.300 only.

195
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:41,452
Rs.300? We are from
Tenali not fools.

196
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:42,554
Tenali?

197
00:23:44,898 --> 00:23:45,796
I'm also from Tenali.

198
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:47,059
Say something else.

199
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:52,069
No difference in my word or rate.
We'll take in our taxi to Ganges,

200
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:52,728
take you around to all the
important places in a boat,

201
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:59,573
and after visiting temple,
I'll drop you safely here. Okay?

202
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:01,578
I can get 100's like you
for Rs.50, you know?

203
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:04,411
100 people are waiting.
- I'll go.- Go man.

204
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:05,677
Why are you putting hand on me?

205
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,012
You come...looks like a
tough guy.

206
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:12,414
Don't you get taxis here?
- You're from Tenali, aren't you?

207
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:14,083
How do you know that?
- I'm also from Tenali.

208
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:16,092
Are you also from Tenali?
What are you doing here?

209
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:17,252
I'm running a taxi here.

210
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,757
Is it all gold jewels?
- Why do you want to know?

211
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:24,165
To tell her to be careful if it's gold,
Kasi is full of thieves.

212
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:26,595
Appears to be a good man.

213
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:29,106
Pure gold.
Will you ply taxi for Rs.50?

214
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:32,939
We both are from same Tenali.
No need of Rs.50.

215
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:35,843
Rs.10 will do.
You say it is pure gold.

216
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:39,047
He's from Tenali, but a fool.
Okay, come.

217
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:45,448
Mr. Balasubramanyam, greetings sir.
What are you doing in Kasi?

218
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:46,957
Are you also a Telugu man?

219
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:49,960
We are about a lakh people here.
- Give me. - Where?

220
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:52,128
I'm a taxi man.
Give me Rs.300.

221
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,961
Don't bargain, mine is
fixed rate...come sir.

222
00:24:57,971 --> 00:25:02,738
Mr. Balu, looks like you've fallen
to the charm of that cheat

223
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,641
He's charging Rs.300 but this
man is changing Rs.10 only.

224
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:09,977
Just talent will not help,
you must be worldly wise.

225
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:13,218
You get in sir.
- What's it? He's saying just Rs.10.

226
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:16,555
You'll know it as
finishing touch, get in.

227
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,982
Stop here. Will you take us
into the water? Get down.

228
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,323
Get down.

229
00:25:24,832 --> 00:25:27,995
This is Holy Ganges of Kasi,
bow to her.

230
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:30,762
Greetings.
- Not to me but river Ganges.

231
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:34,496
You brought us to
the river for Rs.10 only.

232
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:38,111
Can't you engage us a boat
at cheaper rate?

233
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,710
Cheap?
- Yes, dead cheap.

234
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,249
Any one from Andhra Pradesh?

235
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:45,845
Come...come sir.

236
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,714
Gangaram, you seem
to be very excited.

237
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:50,349
He's Pitchaiah.
- Senior Pitchaiah.

238
00:25:50,524 --> 00:25:53,118
I'm Junior Pitchaiah.
- He's from our Tenali.

239
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:56,189
You're from Tenali.
I'm from Tenali.

240
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:58,695
We all are from Tenali.

241
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:02,029
Don't dance for coming
from the same place.

242
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:04,261
First tell me the rate.
- Rate?

243
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,597
Why are you removing
your slipper?

244
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,029
Take my slipper.
- I'm wearing one already.

245
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,608
Beat me with my slipper.
-It may end up in court case.

246
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:13,869
Rates?
For the people of Tenali?

247
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:16,038
Rs.1 is enough.
- One rupee?

248
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,210
He's also another fool.

249
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:21,946
I'm suspect their motive.
- Shut up foolish lady.

250
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:24,956
He's patriotic towards his native.
Let's encash it.

251
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:29,218
You engage a cheap priest also.
- Real cheap priest.

252
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:30,420
Priest!

253
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:34,567
Hail Lord Shiva.
Who called me now?

254
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:35,724
We!

255
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,968
Why?

256
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:41,564
Sr. Pitchaiah has come
from our Tenali.

257
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:43,972
From Tenali?
From my Tenali?

258
00:26:44,745 --> 00:26:47,305
Let you be blessed with long life.
- Are you from Tenali?

259
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:48,407
Great to hear

260
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:50,573
Like LTTE taking roots
all over Sri Lanka,

261
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:52,514
People from Tenali have taken
over this place Kasi.

262
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,846
Tell me your rate.
- My rate?

263
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:57,921
A Telugu man, that too from Tenali.
Are you fixing a rate for me?

264
00:26:58,091 --> 00:26:58,921
It's free for you.

265
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:01,754
Look, who is here?

266
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:05,258
Oh my god! Mr. S.P. Greetings sir.
What has brought you to Kasi?

267
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:07,263
My voice got little defiled by
singing obscene songs.

268
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:09,800
I've come to clean myself with
a dip in holy water.- Get in sir.

269
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:11,092
'NANDHINI'

270
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:14,604
It's Nandhini on taxi and boat here.
Who is this Nandhini?

271
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:17,938
She's my boss's niece.
Not only on taxi and boat,

272
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:21,603
we may not able read but you
can see that in his heart also.

273
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:23,143
Too...

274
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:28,277
My boss gave this boat to
earn my livelihood.

275
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:30,480
Okay, take his bag. - Good.

276
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:39,689
Put your gold jewels into this.

277
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,289
Stop! Why?

278
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,629
If you make it into a bundle and
dip in Ganges, it'll double.

279
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:45,465
Don't fool me as
I'm from Tenali.

280
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,470
Will gold become double on
dipping in Ganges?

281
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:48,801
It'll happen, fool.

282
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:50,807
Are you suspecting me,
a royal priest?

283
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:53,635
Hail Lord Shiva.
What's this?

284
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:54,906
Isn't it?

285
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:57,974
Why did you throw away
gold ring into water?

286
00:27:58,151 --> 00:28:01,314
I didn't throw man.
Go and see you'll find 2 rings.

287
00:28:01,488 --> 00:28:03,149
2 rings? Really?
- Go and take it.

288
00:28:03,323 --> 00:28:05,655
This business is very good.
Will it become 2 rings?

289
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:09,819
How is it possible?

290
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:10,986
Oh my god! 2 rings.
Thank you lord.

291
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:15,165
Really it has become 2 rings.
What's this magic?

292
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:18,168
It's not my magic, man.
It's River Ganges.

293
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:21,732
Recently I threw a tyre and
lo behold! I got a taxi.

294
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:24,006
I threw a paddle
and got a new boat.

295
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:25,007
Oh!- Good show boys.

296
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:28,341
Father, you too go & take a
dip in water. - Why?

297
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:30,005
I'll get 2 fathers.
- Why two?

298
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:32,014
He's right, you sleep a lot

299
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:34,949
If one is sleeping another
will be awake.- You shut up.

300
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:38,355
Inauspicious time is
fast approaching

301
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:41,619
Pack the jewels.
Or else the jewels will vanish.

302
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,355
You take out.
- Wait, I'll take it.

303
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,690
You remove it.
I'll also help.

304
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:46,958
Wait, even the loin thread
is gold, I'll remove it.

305
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:50,094
Come...greet goddess Ganges.

306
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:58,306
Please repeat after me.

307
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,381
It's dedicated to
Goddess Ganges.

308
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,053
Turn towards east and bow
with your wife & son.- Why east?

309
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,926
Tenali is in east.
- Then, okay...you turn.

310
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:31,233
Sir, turn this side.
Open your eyes & see.

311
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:35,344
Stop...stop...
You mustn't touch it fool.

312
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,080
My packet has grown bigger

313
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:48,159
You mustn't touch it, fool.
Stop...come.

314
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:49,819
Come...

315
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,931
You mustn't touch it, madam.

316
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:02,639
What's your grandfather name?
- Bochu Pedalingaiah!

317
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:04,968
It's not Bochu, it's Bachu

318
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:08,103
In the life whether it is
Bochu or Bachu doesn't matter.

319
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:09,646
Sir...

320
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,652
Why are you going away?
- What else do you want us to do?

321
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:20,791
You fool...idiot! Goddess got angry
and turned gold into iron.

322
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:23,623
Who told you to touch it?
Who brought him here?

323
00:30:23,797 --> 00:30:25,856
This man not me.
- I'll kill you.

324
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,631
Stop...stop

325
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,793
Do you want a
taxi for Rs.10?

326
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:34,463
You don't get a tea for one rupee
and you want a boat.

327
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:36,131
Do you want a priest free?

328
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:39,806
You're from Tenali.
I'm also from Tenali.

329
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:42,638
Dear...- Father.

330
00:30:42,816 --> 00:30:46,308
There are 64 ghats
like 64 art forms.

331
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:50,646
That is 'Harischandra Ghat. - Is it?

332
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:53,987
King Harischandra worked as
undertaker here only.

333
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:55,150
Is it here? - Yes, here only.

334
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:00,664
World over people die for a living.
But here in Kasi people live to die.

335
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:02,829
Your philosophy is good.

336
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,035
What are you doing sir?

337
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:08,163
They say it's good deed to throw
a coin in Ganges.

338
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:09,330
You're innocent sir.

339
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,501
When this tradition started,
there were no rupee coins.

340
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:13,771
Only copper coins.

341
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:16,175
Water in copper ware is
always good to health

342
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:17,680
So, they threw coins into river.

343
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:20,452
I don't want to hurt your sentiment.
You may drop the coin sir.

344
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:24,183
Humanity is greater than money.

345
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:28,358
I don't feel like I'm talking
to a taxi driver.

346
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:32,021
I feel like Lord Krishna, Charioteer
of Arjuna is talking to me.

347
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,360
That is too much.
Come down a little.

348
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,864
When I'm saying it sincerely why are
you brushing it as too much?

349
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:41,201
Praise is like scent.
You've to use it on body.

350
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:43,035
Just because it's fragrant
you shouldn't drink it.

351
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:46,709
We are artists.
Do you know what captivates us?

352
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,542
Praise and claps.
- Well said sir.

353
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,243
Sing mamma!

354
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:08,788
Lord Ganapathy, we offer prayers
chanting your name in our hearts...

355
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:20,630
A Lord who is prayed
by Sages & saints...

356
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:32,314
Son of Lord Shiva and
brother of Lord Guha...

357
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:37,388
Light of this world...
abode of peace...

358
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,492
A lover of great
drama & literature...

359
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:47,990
Traveling on a mouse,
lover of pleasantness.

360
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:23,298
Sir...madam...brother...
help us with Rs.100.

361
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:24,365
Come sir, I'll drop
you inside.

362
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,300
I'll hold my bag.
- No problem sir.

363
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,468
If you come to Hyderabad, be my
guest for at least 2 days.

364
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:34,167
I'll record your voice.
- No need of so much praise.

365
00:34:36,147 --> 00:34:37,375
Sir...it's me.

366
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:38,971
You are Pitchaiah, aren't you?

367
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:44,645
Not just me alone. I'm with
my wife & son also.

368
00:34:44,822 --> 00:34:46,983
You were nice and happy
while coming here.

369
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:48,147
Didn't I tell you to
see the finishing touch?

370
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:49,314
You've seen...

371
00:34:53,497 --> 00:34:56,159
It's my responsibility to send
them to Tenali, they'd come.

372
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:59,158
This is a regular
feature with me.

373
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:00,735
It's time for your train,
you carry on sir.

374
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:05,005
For you...you and me.

375
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:06,268
What about for me?
- For you also.

376
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,004
For you...you...
me and you...

377
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:11,671
For you...

378
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:16,085
What's this?
We are just three.

379
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,178
But there are 4 parts here

380
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:20,687
When we are 3 here
who gets that fourth share?

381
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:22,018
Me!

382
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,953
Why are you tensed?
- No need to get tensed.

383
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:27,357
We are friends.
- Have you joined our group?

384
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:28,190
What else then?

385
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:31,528
Then, we can steal the
entire Kasi town.

386
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:34,030
Your fingers are shining
bright with ring?

387
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:36,036
Priest asked him to wear
for good fortune.

388
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,199
Bangle for you?
- For keeping out bad omen.

389
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:40,365
Please give this ring to Sankar.

390
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,705
Shut up. He's a
ring master himself.

391
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,778
No need of ring for him

392
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:48,211
Pack all jewels. - Why?

393
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:50,785
If I drown you all in Ganges.
- You'll come out in two's.

394
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:53,379
Our run has come to an end.

395
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:55,385
Remove...remove it.

396
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:58,218
What's this?
Why are you brandishing a knife?

397
00:35:58,395 --> 00:36:00,386
These are our
ancestors jewels.

398
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:03,124
Your ancestors have come to
take it back...look.

399
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:09,736
Hard earned jewels will never
get stolen away. - Oh my jewels.

400
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:11,932
Bloody rogue.
- Thank you, Sankaranarayana.

401
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,573
My ring...- Where's my
auspicious thread?

402
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:19,576
Do people of Tenali appear
like fools to you?

403
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,480
I've a great power behind me,
you know? You come.

404
00:36:23,587 --> 00:36:27,023
If you do this again,
what'll be the result?

405
00:36:27,258 --> 00:36:30,421
We'll get drowned in Ganges
and float at Harischandra Ghat.

406
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:32,084
Excellent!
Now you may leave.

407
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,434
Who is the man who spell bound
us with his music?

408
00:36:40,604 --> 00:36:44,597
He's my maternal uncle.
He's a taxi driver in Railway station.

409
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:47,175
Uncle means your suitor?

410
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:50,106
Marrying my uncle is impossible.

411
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:54,718
In fact he remains a bachelor
to educate me and my brother.

412
00:36:57,621 --> 00:37:00,613
If your uncle falls in love with
a girl and marries suddenly

413
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,053
My uncle getting married?

414
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:08,625
He's strict bachelor like Bhisma,
Lord Anjaneya and Vivekananda.

415
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:12,462
He didn't get a girl suitable for him.
That's why he's still a bachelor.

416
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:14,536
I know very well
about my uncle.

417
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:19,966
Okay, let's have a bet for fun.
- Bet?

418
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:23,139
If I make your uncle to
agree to marry me?

419
00:37:23,314 --> 00:37:25,475
Sorry Pallavi
You're Governor's daughter

420
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:27,139
You can go to
Governor's residence,

421
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:28,808
but can never enter
the life of my uncle.

422
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,476
What if I enter?
- No way.

423
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:31,814
Okay, let me see it.

424
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,550
In 2 days a strange
thing will happen.

425
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:45,567
Is she a girl or a walking
jewellary shop?

426
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:47,334
She's a mobile goddess of wealth.

427
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:50,098
If I sell the jewels on her,
I can buy 6 taxis.

428
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:53,442
Greetings madam.
Do you want a taxi?

429
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:56,839
A Telugu taxi diver
was here...

430
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:57,844
Are you a Telugu girl?

431
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:00,715
I'm the lone Telugu
taxi driver in Kasi.

432
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:02,451
Yuck! Not you.

433
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:06,520
You're a Bill collector
and he's a Bill Clinton.

434
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,851
Though he's a driver,
he's majestic.

435
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:12,723
What's in it? It's the same
steering and same accelerator.

436
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,022
Is it pure gold?
- Yes.

437
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,363
If it is pure, I've to take you.
I'll drop you safely.

438
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:20,935
My bag.

439
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:22,367
Who is that?

440
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:25,266
Brother, is it you?
Greetings.

441
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:28,204
I've brought a client for you.
Pure...- What?

442
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:31,212
Pure Telugu girl.
Here's your Bill Clinton.

443
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:34,612
I've lost my gold.

444
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:35,715
Where do you want to go?

445
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:39,386
Into the Ganges.
- Into Ganges or near?

446
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:43,288
Near...- Taxi is there...come.

447
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:04,407
I beg of you.
I didn't cheat anyone.

448
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:06,071
Okay, where's Giri?

449
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,083
He went to other side with
priest with a passenger.

450
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:12,916
Brother, passenger is
shining bright...

451
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,581
If I beat you....
Again back to monkey business?

452
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:18,660
No, I'm mending paddle
without any work.

453
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:19,987
Where's your priest?

454
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:22,926
Priest!

455
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,591
Who disturbed my penance?

456
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:27,532
You've got a client.

457
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:31,104
Oh my god!
I don't want this client.

458
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:32,472
I'll not scold you...come.

459
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:35,207
No...come here.

460
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:41,141
Don't beat me in front of
a girl...- Okay.

461
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:43,609
It seems her parents died in
a road accident.

462
00:39:43,787 --> 00:39:47,348
Oh! What a beautiful golden girl!
Leave her to us. We'll take care.

463
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:53,362
If you start your tricks again,
your heads will roll down.

464
00:39:53,797 --> 00:39:55,458
Send her after offering the prayers,
I'll wait in the car.

465
00:39:57,134 --> 00:40:01,628
You promised to stay
with me till I go back.

466
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:03,295
Why are you leaving
me halfway through?

467
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:06,307
They are here, aren't they?
- Their faces are like...

468
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:08,468
...divine?

469
00:40:08,645 --> 00:40:09,839
You look like thieves.

470
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:11,477
You come with me.

471
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:14,048
You come man. Looks like
we'll lose the gold.

472
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:16,142
I mean gold like client.

473
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,380
Come.

474
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:20,153
Don't jump...I'll come.
come on man.

475
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:26,857
Sit down.

476
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:37,740
Keep your jewels here.
- Oh no.- No dear...no.

477
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,206
Tell me your grandfather's name.

478
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:48,674
My grandfather's name
is K.V. Mahadevan

479
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:52,622
K.V. Mahadevan?
Greatest music director?

480
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:56,015
A maiden has come with a pot.

481
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:58,354
I go crazy on seeing her.

482
00:41:00,697 --> 00:41:02,358
Why are you dancing?- Nothing.

483
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:03,522
He's a strange man.

484
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,363
There's a gold shop here and
he says not to steal.

485
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:09,301
Moreover he's guarding her.

486
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:12,869
Your father's name?

487
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:19,709
S.V. Ranga Rao

488
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:22,542
S.V. Ranga Rao?
Great actor.

489
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,052
Marriage feast.
Exotic varieties of food!

490
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,323
Do your work, man!

491
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:34,057
He's watching us.
He'll break our bones.

492
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:36,790
Your mother's name?

493
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:39,934
Why is she crying
for every question?

494
00:41:40,904 --> 00:41:42,235
Silk Smitha

495
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,897
Suitors are you ready?- Shut up.

496
00:41:45,742 --> 00:41:48,905
Girl! Stand up.

497
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,741
Is your mother's name
Silk Smitha?

498
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:53,405
Is your father
S.V. Ranga Rao?

499
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:55,074
Is your grand father
K.V. Mahadevan?

500
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:58,085
Are you offering prayers
in the name of film stars?

501
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:00,086
Who am I?
Royal Priest.

502
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:03,249
Do I look like a fool?

503
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:07,928
Should I offer prayers
to the dead?

504
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,089
She's going to him.
He'll break our backs.

505
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:14,601
Sister...stop.

506
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:15,430
What's it?

507
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:16,932
Stop dear.

508
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:19,598
Playing tricks again?

509
00:42:19,776 --> 00:42:22,438
I'll beat...- No...nothing like that.
I beg you.- What happened?

510
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:24,774
You'll not forgive her
if you know about her.

511
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:27,109
She's telling film stars names
for offering prayers.

512
00:42:27,284 --> 00:42:28,774
Film...- No.

513
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,044
She says no.- No?

514
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:33,385
Didn't you say your grandfather
is K.V. Mahadevan?

515
00:42:33,957 --> 00:42:37,984
I said K.V. Madhava Rao.
- K.V. Madhava Rao?

516
00:42:38,295 --> 00:42:40,456
Didn't you say your father
is S.V. Ranga Rao?

517
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:44,397
Oh No I said S.V. Rama Rao.
- S.V. Rama Rao?

518
00:42:44,635 --> 00:42:46,796
No...please no...no.

519
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:49,738
Swear on Kasi Visalakshi
and tell the truth.

520
00:42:49,973 --> 00:42:52,806
Didn't you say your
mother is Silk Smitha?

521
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:54,637
I never said like that.

522
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:57,974
I'll be no more patient.
No...no please no...

523
00:42:58,148 --> 00:43:00,981
Go...go away or else
I'll break your legs.

524
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:05,480
Mother! - Girl....

525
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:10,491
Girl...it's wrong, what's this?
- Leave me...allow me to die.

526
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:11,218
Do you've any sense?

527
00:43:11,828 --> 00:43:13,989
I don't have anyone.
Why should I live?

528
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:15,491
For whom?

529
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,830
Am I not here?

530
00:43:20,337 --> 00:43:23,033
I mean all my people
are yours too.

531
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,240
Really? - Really.

532
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:28,504
Really means for
few days only.

533
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:32,440
Few days or all the life.
Leave it on me man.

534
00:43:38,522 --> 00:43:40,387
Come, this is our home.
My home.

535
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:44,724
Coming uncle.
- You go upstairs.

536
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:01,867
Nothing like that

537
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:04,203
She was falling down slipping...
I was just...

538
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:05,939
...holding her...to help her.

539
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,872
Uncle

540
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:11,616
Nandhini, your friend.
- My friend?

541
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:15,889
I mean like your friend,
our guest, take care of her.

542
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:18,558
You go.

543
00:44:20,564 --> 00:44:22,395
Girl! - Yes boy.

544
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:24,826
You may slip again...be careful.

545
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:27,832
Go upstairs.

546
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:30,229
Nandhini careful.
Take good care of her.

547
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,241
Why are you watching us
like a film?

548
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:38,245
Nothing, she's a special guest.
What about night's arrangement?

549
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:40,906
What's that double entendre
with arrangement?

550
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:45,077
Nothing like that only
one meaning, I mean food.

551
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:46,415
She'll eat whatever we eat.

552
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,080
I'm here to take care of it...go.
Go away.

553
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:54,260
Grandma.- What's it son?

554
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,661
Where are my clothes?
- I didn't see

555
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,102
Where did he go away?

556
00:45:02,773 --> 00:45:04,104
Boy! What do you want?

557
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:07,141
My clothes are
missing from here.

558
00:45:14,785 --> 00:45:17,481
Girl...- What's it boy?

559
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:19,779
What?- It's macaroni...

560
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:22,481
Not on the cot,
but on your body.

561
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,119
Clothes

562
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:26,694
I mean why are you
wearing my clothes?

563
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,791
I don't have clothes so

564
00:45:28,965 --> 00:45:30,796
Are you wearing my clothes?
- Yes.

565
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:31,456
Take off.

566
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:33,560
Take off now.

567
00:45:38,642 --> 00:45:40,974
What happened now?
I mean I didn't do it to...

568
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:43,305
Mother! Father! Grandfather!

569
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,469
Why are you calling them now?

570
00:45:44,648 --> 00:45:47,811
They are feeding me here but
not giving clothes.

571
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:51,849
I mean you could've used
Nandhini's clothes.

572
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:56,717
Should I wear
Nandhini's clothes?

573
00:45:56,993 --> 00:45:58,324
What's wrong in it? Both are...

574
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:02,989
Look at our personalities...
Look at her waist size and mine.

575
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,991
What's her height
and my height?

576
00:46:06,837 --> 00:46:08,668
God, what's that?

577
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,829
Pant is loose.

578
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:13,070
First wear the pant.

579
00:46:13,343 --> 00:46:15,504
My hands are dirty.
You help me in wearing pant.

580
00:46:15,846 --> 00:46:16,608
Don't rush.

581
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:23,948
Hey, down.- I know.

582
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:27,346
Don't shake.

583
00:46:27,524 --> 00:46:30,550
How can I not shake
if you touch me?

584
00:46:30,861 --> 00:46:31,759
Am I doing it fine?

585
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:35,687
Have I come up to the waist?

586
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:39,199
No, you are half way through.
- Half way?

587
00:46:41,204 --> 00:46:43,104
You've come up.
- Hold it.

588
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,872
Thank you boy.
- Happy to hear it. Go inside.

589
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:48,908
Greetings sir.- Greetings.

590
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:50,978
It's going down again.
Do you've to greet them now?

591
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:53,038
Why are you watching
us like T.V.?

592
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:55,878
No need to be a spoilsport.
- Come let's go.

593
00:46:56,052 --> 00:46:58,213
Wait...I'll show you.

594
00:47:01,892 --> 00:47:05,123
If I tie it tight,
it'll never come down again.

595
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:58,038
Oh! Dear, has the
love bug bitten you?

596
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:01,375
Has it invited you passionately?

597
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:08,044
Oh! Has she pulled my heart's
strings with her plait?

598
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:12,548
Oh my dear!
Come, let's unite in love.

599
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:16,059
Oh dear! Shall I rule over
you as your husband?

600
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:20,064
I'll cross barriers of happiness
and bite your cheeks.

601
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:23,465
You've taken
over me, my dear.

602
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:33,672
Don't tease me saying you were
born for me, my cupid?

603
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:40,311
Oh beauty! You've come
to charm me.

604
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:47,075
Let the first rains of our love fall,
and our youth start blooming.

605
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,484
My lover's cheeks must
blush with shine.

606
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:53,490
And the festival
of embrace be celebrated.

607
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,562
If you're hungry I'll give myself
and shock you with eyes.

608
00:49:57,664 --> 00:50:00,895
Spread a bed in
my heart, my dear.

609
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:56,219
Has the young maiden
enticed to kiss her?

610
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,382
Every part of body is divine.

611
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:06,154
I'm anxious to have you.
If you miss, it's disappointment.

612
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,563
Come on start
celebrating 'Love'.

613
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:12,830
Venus must come to me and
offer personal services.

614
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:19,239
Desires have developed wings &
spreading a bed for you.

615
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:23,247
If you come softly I'll hug you.
If I hug, I'll steal you.

616
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:26,443
With the prowess
off my manly power

617
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:56,709
Priest...priest

618
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,211
Who is that?

619
00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,143
It's me, no jokes.

620
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,544
A rich client from Andhra
has come...come with me.

621
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,753
He's a great priest in Kasi.
He'll offer prayers to dead.

622
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:14,556
Come...come.

623
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:15,891
Looks like our boys have
trapped a rich client.

624
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,394
Why have you brought
so many photos?

625
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,832
By any chance did your entire
family die together.

626
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,509
Brother doesn't like
too much of talk.

627
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,577
Thank god!
I was about to show off

628
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,237
t would've cracked up my skull.

629
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,973
Sir, please come in my boat.

630
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,525
Come...come...come and sit here.

631
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:47,860
Keep the photos & other material
and take a dip in Ganges.

632
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,262
Hail Lord Shiva!

633
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:02,605
Guru, they're not gold party,
they're killer party.

634
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:08,944
Goddess Ganges

635
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,784
They say a dip in you will
cleanse all our sins.

636
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:16,357
The man who killed my brothers
in my region,

637
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:21,461
...bless me so that he comes to
same region to die in my hand.

638
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,231
Sit down.

639
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,140
Offer prayers of these 3 dead

640
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,909
Sir, please tell me their names.

641
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:41,481
Kathula Veera Reddy
...killed 70 people.

642
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,818
Kathula Veerabhadra Reddy
...killed 80 people.

643
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,822
Kathula Veera Pratap Reddy...
killed 100 people.

644
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,321
It's 12 years since
all three are dead.

645
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,490
For safer side ask them
which place they're from?

646
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,989
Where are you from sir?

647
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:58,998
Cuddapah

648
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:02,334
Start.

649
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,831
They are ordering me to
start the ritual.

650
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,000
You too stay with me.
- You've to chant the mantras.

651
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:11,011
I know that,
you too stay with me.

652
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,533
My days are remembered.

653
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,797
I beg of you sir.

654
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,371
Mumtaz! It's me Pradeep

655
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,313
There's a problem
in my house.

656
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,218
Tarnished.

657
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:57,057
You've tarnished my respect.

658
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,327
Dishonored me.

659
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,663
It's been years since I've come
from Hyderabad & settle down here.

660
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:09,672
Till now no one dared to
look into my eyes.

661
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,667
You're a Muslim,
she's a Hindu.

662
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,473
You've tried to molest her.

663
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,342
If this news leaks out,

664
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:24,816
Hindu & Muslims kill each other
for me not for Rama.

665
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,013
Yes sir

666
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,588
Sir, I'm a family man with kids.

667
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:29,622
Hold his hands.

668
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,626
No!

669
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,089
Nagesh, call police

670
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,832
Mumtaz, I'll wait
for you at canteen.

671
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,272
Listen to me I'm scared.

672
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,933
What are you listening?
- Why not possible?

673
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,774
If your father doesn't
approve our marriage,

674
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,108
I'll elope with you.

675
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,978
You come immediately to
our college canteen.

676
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,321
Aren't you Pradeep's uncle?

677
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:03,448
Yes

678
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,390
Shaukat Ali has taken your
nephew into his custody.

679
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,892
Khan sahib, what's this?
- Who are you?

680
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,151
I'm Pradeep's uncle.

681
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:45,566
Did you brought him
like human or beast?

682
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,900
I'm also from Hyderabad.

683
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:55,569
I know Hindus respect women.

684
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,448
Do you know what your
nephew had done?

685
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,690
Tell me Mumtaz.

686
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:16,021
Do you love him?
Or else is he following you?

687
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:19,190
Tell me.

688
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,402
I don't love him.

689
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,808
He's chasing me.

690
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,612
Enough...you may go.

691
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:47,762
What would you do if a girl faces
some problem in your home?

692
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,391
Beat him.

693
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:05,745
If a student fails it's the
mistake of his teacher.

694
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:10,576
If a child commits mistake,
it's a fault of his father.

695
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,783
I brought him up
as mother & father.

696
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,325
If he commits a mistake
it's my fault.

697
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,190
Beat me.

698
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,459
No, please beat me.
I committed the sin. My uncle is god.

699
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,624
You've been beating him
for long time, kill him.

700
00:58:55,798 --> 00:59:00,360
enough...release him.

701
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:15,049
The mistake was in my side.
So, I'm going away head down.

702
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,586
Or else I would've taken
few heads from here.

703
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,349
If my nephew is calling her,

704
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,852
It means how far your
daughter has gone...

705
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,058
is a question I'll
leave it to you.

706
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:33,492
Whether Hindu or Muslim,
any woman is like my sister.

707
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:44,079
Never make it a public issue
anything concerned about a girl.

708
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:48,878
Know her heart and
get her married.

709
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,881
Good bye

710
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:19,648
Sir, Mumtaz has taken poison.
She's in Hospital.

711
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,129
She wrote this letter
and took poison.

712
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:41,003
With the grace of Allah,
she's saved.

713
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,798
Inform our men.

714
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,925
Uncle!- What?

715
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,529
You are seeing the
sword in his hand.

716
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:52,207
I see repentance in his eyes.

717
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:58,338
come out Shaukat Ali Khan.

718
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,678
Sankaranarayana, please forgive me.

719
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:24,363
I never bowed my head
before anyone in my life.

720
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:28,504
First time, I'm bowing to you.

721
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:35,378
Look at this.
This is a letter from my daughter.

722
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,449
Do you know it's contents?

723
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,923
Father, you've committed a mistake.

724
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,517
You beat a good man.

725
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,863
The reason for it is I couldn't dare
to accept my love for Pradeep.

726
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,465
...it resulted in a disgrace
to a great man.

727
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,699
...ask forgiveness from him
after my death...she left a message.

728
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:06,944
Saving my daughter from death,
I've brought her here.

729
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,283
My child Mumtaz.

730
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:26,096
She's no more my daughter,
she's yours from now.

731
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,564
Go child. Take his blessings.

732
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:31,732
No need, dear

733
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:39,904
If every one is as magnanimous as you,
there'll be no communal clashes.

734
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,848
Why would lovers commit
suicide for religion?

735
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,188
I bow to your magnanimity.
- No.

736
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:50,319
I'm very happy.

737
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:53,084
Come dear.

738
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,589
Come here.

739
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:05,005
Come my dear.
Epitome of love, Radha.

740
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:09,870
Innocent girl who thinks white is
milk and black is water.

741
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,949
Sankaranarayana has come.
If he sees us now, we are finished.

742
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:29,021
Where is my chain?

743
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,366
Did you steal my chain?

744
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,803
If you tell anyone it's
my present of love.

745
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,036
I'll get a bad name.

746
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:44,503
It's better to take it back.

747
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:51,571
Thank god! Nobody had seen me.
I'm saved.

748
01:06:59,213 --> 01:07:02,705
Come to me, my dancing
beautiful doll.

749
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:06,649
I've something for you,
my Kondapalli doll.

750
01:07:07,221 --> 01:07:10,384
Come to me,
Oh male cuckoo.

751
01:07:10,558 --> 01:07:14,392
I've fallen in love with you
my full moon.

752
01:07:16,564 --> 01:07:18,395
Come into my arms, dear.

753
01:07:20,568 --> 01:07:22,229
Rule my youth.

754
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:26,233
A sprightly ravishing
young maiden

755
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:30,343
A new romance is teasing me
to drench in it's first rain.

756
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:30,327
Oh! Enchanting maiden,
you're making me go crazy.

757
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:32,462
How can I leave you?

758
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:38,239
Your masculinity is
charming me.

759
01:08:38,712 --> 01:08:40,475
Don't delay any further.

760
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:52,156
You've teased me and
how can you deny now?

761
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,323
Don't you've any mercy
for your embrace?

762
01:08:56,497 --> 01:09:03,835
How can I stop you taking
liberty with me?

763
01:09:06,006 --> 01:09:08,099
You asked for it.

764
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,841
Why so fast?

765
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:15,504
Is having fun sour to you?

766
01:09:15,683 --> 01:09:19,710
Won't an innocent maiden get
scared with your approach?

767
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:25,185
Oh my dear! Your upper cloth
has got displaced.

768
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,350
My heart is lost.

769
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:14,572
You're teasing a man and
denying him the opportunity.

770
01:10:14,608 --> 01:10:17,839
Is it fair on you
my beautiful maiden?

771
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:23,915
Can't you take liberty with him
and become mine?

772
01:10:24,084 --> 01:10:25,847
Become my man.

773
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:37,592
Don't rush.
Let's wait till marriage.

774
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:41,929
I can't hold myself till then.

775
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:49,338
Stop teaching morals
and break loose.

776
01:10:51,612 --> 01:10:53,443
Will you remain steady?

777
01:10:55,449 --> 01:10:57,280
Come into my lap.

778
01:10:57,451 --> 01:11:01,114
I'm suspecting if you're a girl.

779
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:05,224
No doubt, I'm your girl.

780
01:11:22,339 --> 01:11:24,432
We've already
fixed the engagement.

781
01:11:25,509 --> 01:11:29,343
We were brothers-in-law
now we are becoming kinsmen.

782
01:11:31,849 --> 01:11:34,010
VC sir, it's me.
Governor Chennakesava Reddy.

783
01:11:34,184 --> 01:11:35,446
Greetings sir

784
01:11:35,519 --> 01:11:38,181
I want my daughter to
come here immediately.

785
01:11:38,355 --> 01:11:40,721
It's a week since she
is been with you.

786
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:45,351
Come here? She'll be in the
campus only, search.

787
01:11:45,696 --> 01:11:47,391
I want a return phone call
in 5 minutes.

788
01:11:56,874 --> 01:11:59,138
Pallavi is not only in college
she's not in hostel too.

789
01:11:59,376 --> 01:12:00,274
Not even in hostel?

790
01:12:00,544 --> 01:12:07,382
She was seen with Sankaranarayana,
uncle of her classmate Nandhini.

791
01:12:09,219 --> 01:12:11,551
What does he do?
- He's a taxi driver.

792
01:12:17,227 --> 01:12:19,889
What happened sir?

793
01:12:20,063 --> 01:12:22,395
My daughter is in Kasi now,
in a taxi driver's house.

794
01:12:22,566 --> 01:12:25,091
And they say she's in
love with him.

795
01:12:26,737 --> 01:12:27,965
I want my daughter back,
right this moment

796
01:12:33,243 --> 01:12:35,074
Sir, you're a Governor,
don't talk like this.

797
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:37,103
Listen to me Kesava.

798
01:12:37,581 --> 01:12:40,311
If you involve police
it'll become a public issue.

799
01:12:40,918 --> 01:12:42,909
C. M.'s henchmen are in Kasi.

800
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:46,253
Send those guys to kill him
and bring back Pallavi.

801
01:12:47,257 --> 01:12:48,918
I want my daughter back.

802
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:56,088
One minute!

803
01:12:59,102 --> 01:13:00,091
Sir, your phone call

804
01:13:02,773 --> 01:13:06,937
Few rowdies entered home and
inquired about you & Pallavi.

805
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:08,099
When I said you're not here,

806
01:13:08,278 --> 01:13:12,339
they damaged everything here
& kidnapped Nandhini & others.

807
01:13:12,783 --> 01:13:14,478
It seems they are proceeding
to Lucknow in train.

808
01:13:14,952 --> 01:13:17,011
They told you to come
there with Pallavi.

809
01:13:18,288 --> 01:13:19,277
What happened?

810
01:13:19,456 --> 01:13:21,117
It seems Nandhini has
been kidnapped.

811
01:13:24,795 --> 01:13:27,559
You don't worry. I'm with you.
You take my helicopter.

812
01:13:41,478 --> 01:13:45,175
Alert Abdul Sattar.
Sankaranarayana is coming there.

813
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:48,709
They have mobilized rowdies.
Sankaranarayana must be safe.

814
01:14:20,183 --> 01:14:22,208
Don't stop the train.

815
01:14:35,866 --> 01:14:37,527
Yes, Gaffar! What happened?

816
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:04,121
Uncle

817
01:15:06,563 --> 01:15:12,729
Uncle...Uncle

818
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:55,600
Run over them.

819
01:17:49,726 --> 01:17:50,249
Uncle!

820
01:18:47,284 --> 01:18:51,277
No need to worry.
Come with me.

821
01:18:56,493 --> 01:18:58,290
He has taken her.
- Taken her?

822
01:19:02,632 --> 01:19:03,621
A taxi driver!

823
01:19:08,138 --> 01:19:09,298
For the silly thing you've done...

824
01:19:15,545 --> 01:19:17,137
Why didn't you tell me
you're Governor's daughter?

825
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:18,845
Why did you lie to me?

826
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:21,480
Uncle, she's a good girl.

827
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:24,484
I'll break your teeth.
I'm pampering you,

828
01:19:24,654 --> 01:19:26,952
Are you bringing disrespect to
family joining with her?

829
01:19:27,157 --> 01:19:27,816
Shut up!

830
01:19:34,064 --> 01:19:36,362
She said she likes you.

831
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:37,492
What?

832
01:19:40,003 --> 01:19:40,765
Do you like me?

833
01:19:41,171 --> 01:19:44,163
No...love

834
01:19:46,142 --> 01:19:48,235
Chasing a stranger is not love.

835
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:49,443
It's desire.

836
01:19:49,779 --> 01:19:52,179
In short it's lust.

837
01:20:07,564 --> 01:20:08,690
Who wants your salutation?

838
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:10,856
What's happening here?
Did you bring him out?

839
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:16,599
What are you looking at?
...not a brick must remain.

840
01:20:16,706 --> 01:20:17,695
Kill everyone inside.

841
01:20:17,874 --> 01:20:19,102
Your daughter is inside.

842
01:20:22,879 --> 01:20:26,280
My daughter is inside.

843
01:20:27,951 --> 01:20:29,714
Announce it.

844
01:20:38,028 --> 01:20:40,826
Accept your fault
before them...come.

845
01:20:44,834 --> 01:20:46,563
I haven't done anything wrong
other than loving you.

846
01:20:46,903 --> 01:20:47,733
You are my husband.

847
01:20:47,904 --> 01:20:49,735
Did god appear in your
dream and told you?

848
01:20:50,473 --> 01:20:52,338
The pearl chain is
your neck says so.

849
01:20:58,715 --> 01:21:02,344
When I took a dip in holy Ganges
chanting God's name.

850
01:21:02,786 --> 01:21:05,118
...it fell from my neck and
reached your neck.

851
01:21:05,755 --> 01:21:08,588
Doesn't it mean Lord had
identified you for me?

852
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:11,920
Even if Lord permits
this is impossible. Come.

853
01:21:14,531 --> 01:21:15,259
Pallavi dear

854
01:21:15,632 --> 01:21:17,429
Kill him.

855
01:21:23,506 --> 01:21:24,768
Stop...stop

856
01:21:59,142 --> 01:21:59,801
Father...

857
01:22:12,655 --> 01:22:13,644
Sir you...

858
01:22:15,992 --> 01:22:17,584
Why are you greeting
your enemy?

859
01:22:18,895 --> 01:22:20,055
He's not an enemy.

860
01:22:21,464 --> 01:22:23,989
He's an enigma to
people like you.

861
01:22:25,235 --> 01:22:26,668
My daughter is not in Kasi.

862
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:32,231
I've come to know just now
she's with the Lord himself.

863
01:22:34,844 --> 01:22:37,745
I committed a mistake
without knowing it was you.

864
01:22:38,948 --> 01:22:40,779
I ordered my men to attack
your people & your home.

865
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:42,008
Please forgive me.

866
01:22:42,185 --> 01:22:42,879
Don't say like that.

867
01:22:43,053 --> 01:22:45,681
If you really love
my daughter,

868
01:22:45,855 --> 01:22:48,255
I'll get you both married right
now here on the street.

869
01:22:49,059 --> 01:22:51,027
I never intended
to marry her.

870
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:52,628
In fact I never knew
her true identity also

871
01:22:53,029 --> 01:22:54,894
She came here claiming
she's an orphan.

872
01:22:55,331 --> 01:22:57,731
After this incident
she says she loves me.

873
01:22:58,201 --> 01:23:00,431
I was bringing her to you
saying she was wrong.

874
01:23:00,603 --> 01:23:02,036
She says she's in
love with you.

875
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:05,140
She wants you.
Please marry her.

876
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:08,370
Please forgive me.

877
01:23:09,145 --> 01:23:12,137
I can't marry till
Nandhini is married.

878
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:14,815
I can't go back on
my responsibilities.

879
01:23:23,426 --> 01:23:25,792
Giri, what's it?

880
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:29,892
Sir, if Nandhini's marriage is
hurdle to your marriage

881
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:32,897
I'll marry Nandhini.

882
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:40,903
Eating off your hands, I fell in
love with Nandhini.

883
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:45,472
I got afraid to tell you.
She too loves me.

884
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:04,922
After this marriage,

885
01:24:05,568 --> 01:24:07,092
Sankaranarayana & I are
getting married

886
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:08,430
You must attend
without fail.

887
01:25:30,853 --> 01:25:31,581
Please come madam.

888
01:25:31,754 --> 01:25:33,278
Just now the marriage
ritual got over.

889
01:25:33,456 --> 01:25:34,923
Please bless them.

890
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:38,590
I'm not here to bless
the new couple.

891
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:45,197
Hey Veera Manohar Reddy,
why are you still sitting there?

892
01:25:45,368 --> 01:25:46,357
Come on get up.

893
01:26:08,358 --> 01:26:09,382
Surprised?

894
01:26:09,759 --> 01:26:11,954
He's my nephew.

895
01:26:15,598 --> 01:26:19,932
This marriage is not valid
conducted under threat.

896
01:26:26,242 --> 01:26:26,901
Shut up!

897
01:26:28,244 --> 01:26:33,978
Just say yes, I'll bury all
of them in Kasi.

898
01:26:36,519 --> 01:26:37,611
He'll not speak a word.

899
01:26:38,254 --> 01:26:42,281
This man who can beat
single handedly 100 men

900
01:26:42,759 --> 01:26:45,091
...sorry...Indrasena Reddy

901
01:26:49,632 --> 01:26:55,935
...ask him why he's silent
after we are gone.

902
01:27:32,942 --> 01:27:36,275
Indrasena Reddy! You'll follow
us to our region.

903
01:27:36,779 --> 01:27:37,871
Not to live...

904
01:27:38,314 --> 01:27:40,145
....to get killed
in our hands.

905
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:08,355
Is it Sankaranarayana before us?

906
01:28:09,434 --> 01:28:13,803
Why are you watching
injustice silently?

907
01:28:14,472 --> 01:28:19,637
Ruining the life of Nandhini
by marrying her,

908
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:22,475
they are just walking
out on you.

909
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,641
Why are you just
watching the show?

910
01:28:27,318 --> 01:28:28,512
What happened Sankar?

911
01:28:29,253 --> 01:28:30,015
What's all this?

912
01:28:36,494 --> 01:28:37,688
Please don't talk to me.

913
01:28:39,497 --> 01:28:40,225
You must talk.

914
01:28:45,837 --> 01:28:47,702
You can't tolerate
injustice to anyone.

915
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,064
When Nandhini the girl who is your
life is getting injustice,

916
01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:55,337
Why are you silent?
- Answer me.

917
01:28:55,513 --> 01:28:56,502
I'll answer you.

918
01:29:02,286 --> 01:29:05,050
Are you surprised to see
a dumb man speaking?

919
01:29:11,195 --> 01:29:15,359
I was dumb struck by the situation
he has been brought to from,

920
01:29:15,867 --> 01:29:16,891
today I'm going to talk.

921
01:29:17,535 --> 01:29:19,366
Don't stop me.

922
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,672
The name that brings cheer
to people of Rayalaseema,

923
01:29:27,178 --> 01:29:30,670
The name that brings rain
in drought hit region,

924
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:35,052
The name that turns
barren lands into farms,

925
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:38,220
The name that sends shivers
down the spine of his enemies,

926
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:41,253
that man, Indrasena Reddy,

927
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:45,722
do you know why he left that
place and come to Kasi?

928
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,712
Why are you still cooking?
We are dying in hunger.

929
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:15,125
Why are you behaving
like a child?

930
01:30:15,393 --> 01:30:18,294
Sister, your husband
can't bear hunger.

931
01:30:19,096 --> 01:30:19,960
What's this?

932
01:30:20,765 --> 01:30:25,259
To bring rain and
give food to the poor,

933
01:30:25,603 --> 01:30:29,039
My brother is offering special
prayers fasting for 29 days.

934
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,005
Can't you bear it
for 30 minutes?

935
01:30:31,442 --> 01:30:35,435
We are living for ourselves.
He's living for people.

936
01:30:36,614 --> 01:30:39,981
Today is the last day
of the prayer.

937
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,347
This prayer must end
without any hitch.

938
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:47,457
Who in this region will
dare to stop Indra?

939
01:30:50,928 --> 01:31:00,132
Hail Brother Siva Reddy!

940
01:31:00,304 --> 01:31:03,398
What a pity! Murderers are getting
out are being felicitated.

941
01:31:03,741 --> 01:31:05,971
If Mahatma had been alive,
he would've beaten with his stick.

942
01:31:07,845 --> 01:31:10,040
If we pull his legs & finish him,
half trouble will be over.

943
01:31:11,616 --> 01:31:13,584
Greetings uncle.
You've got a fax message.

944
01:31:13,751 --> 01:31:15,480
Who is he?

945
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:17,583
Father, he's my wife's brother.

946
01:31:18,089 --> 01:31:19,249
His parents are no more.

947
01:31:19,423 --> 01:31:21,152
He's free loading
sitting in our family.

948
01:31:21,325 --> 01:31:22,656
Is it? What's it?

949
01:31:22,927 --> 01:31:25,054
It's in English.
Shall I translate into Telugu?

950
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:25,820
Tell him.

951
01:31:26,097 --> 01:31:27,029
Hey Siva Reddy!

952
01:31:28,165 --> 01:31:30,793
There is no dear or sir,
address in this so...

953
01:31:30,968 --> 01:31:31,764
Tell me.

954
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:35,497
The region was peaceful 1 4 years
the time you were in jail.

955
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:39,604
I'm warning you not to enter
the region for it's peace.

956
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,343
If you want to live never step
into Rayalaseema Region.

957
01:31:44,515 --> 01:31:45,345
He owns the region.

958
01:31:45,516 --> 01:31:46,175
Who is he?

959
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,677
From, Indrasena Reddy

960
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,179
Get lost.

961
01:31:51,956 --> 01:31:54,015
Father, order us.

962
01:31:54,358 --> 01:31:56,383
We'll take you to the
border of the region,

963
01:31:56,694 --> 01:31:59,959
We all your 5 sons will go
and bring his head,

964
01:32:00,364 --> 01:32:02,764
...place it at your feet and
take you into the region.

965
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:06,530
Are you my father?
Am I your father?

966
01:32:07,538 --> 01:32:10,200
I've the pride of this region
before I fathered you.

967
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:13,540
Go home and be ready with
his funeral offerings.

968
01:32:14,211 --> 01:32:15,200
I'll come & have it.

969
01:32:19,383 --> 01:32:21,044
Sister, your husband's
life is saved.

970
01:32:21,218 --> 01:32:22,913
Anyway this man is going to die.
His death is confirmed.

971
01:32:34,565 --> 01:32:38,001
Hey stop...stop.
go back.

972
01:32:41,572 --> 01:32:43,802
Priest, you carry on
without stopping.

973
01:32:44,241 --> 01:32:47,074
This is not the time
to take revenge.

974
01:32:47,244 --> 01:32:48,404
A great sacrifice is
being organized here.

975
01:32:48,579 --> 01:32:51,912
For whom? Is it for
your brother-in-law?

976
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:54,415
Not for you or me, it's for
the welfare of people.

977
01:32:55,686 --> 01:32:58,746
Siva Reddy, don't try to spoil.
Go away from here.

978
01:32:58,923 --> 01:33:00,015
Shut up!

979
01:33:01,092 --> 01:33:02,582
Why should I take
orders from you?

980
01:33:04,095 --> 01:33:06,825
If you've guts...courage...

981
01:33:07,431 --> 01:33:10,628
and if you consider yourself
a man, come out.

982
01:33:10,935 --> 01:33:13,165
Why are you sitting there
bloody coward?

983
01:33:15,606 --> 01:33:19,042
Has your pride
taken back seat?

984
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,771
Don't worry about stopping
a sacrifice half way,

985
01:33:26,617 --> 01:33:30,986
Lord Rama who stopped a sacrifice
to kill demon and then continued it.

986
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:33,389
You too do your duty.

987
01:33:36,127 --> 01:33:37,526
I'll finish the sacrifice.

988
01:33:37,962 --> 01:33:38,860
Let victory be yours

989
01:34:01,152 --> 01:34:05,418
It seems you are organizing
a sacrifice for rain.

990
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:08,549
It seems you'd warned me not
to enter this region.

991
01:34:09,493 --> 01:34:11,154
Do you own this region?

992
01:34:11,328 --> 01:34:14,559
Yes, I own this entire region.

993
01:34:14,999 --> 01:34:17,559
I can give my life
for this region.

994
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:20,763
If situation demands
I can take life also for it.

995
01:34:22,173 --> 01:34:24,903
Go. Go out of this region.

996
01:34:25,342 --> 01:34:29,244
I was thinking my writ was
running large here from jail.

997
01:34:30,514 --> 01:34:33,711
You've killed my men
after growing up.

998
01:34:34,685 --> 01:34:37,245
...waiting for my time.

999
01:34:37,688 --> 01:34:39,178
...waiting for the moment
of my release from jail

1000
01:34:39,356 --> 01:34:41,688
and the moment to
roll down your head.

1001
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,261
Are you so courageous to
stop me from entering here?

1002
01:34:47,031 --> 01:34:52,196
If I don't kill you now,
I'm not the son of my father.

1003
01:34:52,369 --> 01:34:54,394
Son of father

1004
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:56,939
If you're son of one father,

1005
01:34:57,374 --> 01:35:01,071
why would you kill my father
and uncles using a woman?

1006
01:35:01,712 --> 01:35:03,373
If you were really
son of your father,

1007
01:35:03,547 --> 01:35:09,213
Why would you try to stop a ritual
conducted for benefit of people?

1008
01:35:09,386 --> 01:35:10,216
You are remembering
your father too much.

1009
01:35:10,387 --> 01:35:12,947
If I don't send you to meet
your father in heaven today,

1010
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:15,415
I'm not a son of my father.

1011
01:35:15,726 --> 01:35:19,059
Good! There should be one
leader to this region.

1012
01:35:19,396 --> 01:35:23,628
Kill or get killed.
Let's decide it between us.

1013
01:35:24,401 --> 01:35:27,564
My part is to kill and
your part is to get killed.

1014
01:39:27,446 --> 01:39:32,281
As it getting drizzles down
like tinkle of anklets.

1015
01:39:32,785 --> 01:39:37,688
...and earth breaks down into
rapturous music getting thrilled.

1016
01:39:48,133 --> 01:39:53,127
Let the rainbows shower arrows
of rain from black clouds.

1017
01:39:53,305 --> 01:39:58,368
Let the storm quench
the thirst of this region.

1018
01:39:58,644 --> 01:40:03,877
Let the lives of people
sprout with a new hope.

1019
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:09,246
Let there be streams of water
in this drought prone zone.

1020
01:41:22,394 --> 01:41:32,326
Let the sky declare today,
there are no more demons.

1021
01:41:32,905 --> 01:41:37,740
Let this message in blood
be delivered right now.

1022
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:42,813
Inviting you to the
innocent Rayalaseema,

1023
01:41:43,248 --> 01:41:48,151
let the clouds burst
into peals of laughter.

1024
01:41:48,253 --> 01:41:53,350
Let the rain drop like pearls
and adorn our courtyards.

1025
01:41:53,759 --> 01:41:58,753
Let the fragrance of rain spread
all over place like sandalwood,

1026
01:41:58,931 --> 01:42:04,164
Let the message of peace spread
and cover the entire region.

1027
01:43:00,492 --> 01:43:02,653
Indra is calling you
down to earth.

1028
01:43:02,995 --> 01:43:05,156
Respond with heavy showers.

1029
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:10,666
Bring down the sky like rain.

1030
01:43:10,836 --> 01:43:15,705
Quenching a thirst.
Changing our fates.

1031
01:43:16,008 --> 01:43:20,672
Bow to you in the witness
of this great sacrifice.

1032
01:43:21,013 --> 01:43:26,041
The king has turned himself into
a lamp to bring light to earth.

1033
01:43:26,218 --> 01:43:27,845
Giving up worldly pleasures,

1034
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:31,183
...choosing a life of sacrifice
he has become ascetic.

1035
01:43:31,356 --> 01:43:33,847
Making welfare of people
on his aim,

1036
01:43:34,026 --> 01:43:36,688
and his breath as the
sacred fire of the sacrifice,

1037
01:43:36,862 --> 01:43:42,027
he has ordered heaven
to bring down nectar.

1038
01:44:47,897 --> 01:44:51,833
He warned you not to enter the region.
Your death is confirmed.

1039
01:44:52,068 --> 01:44:54,559
You could've lived happily running
a wine shop in Vijayawada.

1040
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:08,779
We swear to kill Indrasena Reddy.

1041
01:45:23,933 --> 01:45:25,924
Sister..- What's it?

1042
01:45:26,102 --> 01:45:27,660
Did you see my pen?- Pen...

1043
01:45:28,271 --> 01:45:29,761
Coming dear...

1044
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:31,873
Your brother-in-law is calling,
find the pen yourself.

1045
01:45:37,614 --> 01:45:40,447
Sister, I kept my glasses here.
it is missing.

1046
01:45:40,617 --> 01:45:43,279
Glasses...coming

1047
01:45:43,453 --> 01:45:45,353
It's time to kids to go to school.
Find it yourself.

1048
01:45:45,622 --> 01:45:48,284
Take care of yourself.
We've work.

1049
01:45:51,628 --> 01:45:54,222
What's this brother?
Everything appears new.

1050
01:45:54,797 --> 01:45:57,630
You take care of an entire region,
but no one is taking care of you.

1051
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,631
Didn't you get it, why?

1052
01:46:01,471 --> 01:46:03,029
This house needs a
daughter-in-law.

1053
01:46:03,473 --> 01:46:06,636
So, they are sending a message
to marry at the earliest.

1054
01:46:06,809 --> 01:46:10,905
Very happy to hear you've
understood our anxiety

1055
01:46:18,821 --> 01:46:20,652
What do you lack boy!

1056
01:46:20,823 --> 01:46:24,589
You're polished black granite.
Color fast guaranteed.

1057
01:46:24,994 --> 01:46:27,053
Don't get wet in rain,
your color may fade.

1058
01:46:27,330 --> 01:46:29,855
Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and
you are of some team.

1059
01:46:31,167 --> 01:46:34,000
Today, your dream girl
Snehalatha Reddy is coming

1060
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:36,604
Your brother-in-law
calls you a misfit.

1061
01:46:36,839 --> 01:46:40,502
I don't know how you do it,
become son-in-law to this family.

1062
01:46:40,843 --> 01:46:44,335
And get your legs washed by them with
your favorite lifebuoy soap.

1063
01:46:44,514 --> 01:46:47,677
Wherever there's life buoy soap,
good health will be there.

1064
01:46:50,019 --> 01:46:53,011
Yes sir.
- How is the dress?- Dress is good.

1065
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:56,522
You mean...do you know the
difference between us?

1066
01:46:56,693 --> 01:46:58,354
We both stay in the same house.

1067
01:46:58,528 --> 01:47:00,689
I'm getting paid and
you don't get paid also.

1068
01:47:00,863 --> 01:47:02,888
Don't anyone in this
region talk properly?

1069
01:47:03,366 --> 01:47:05,732
Why are you carrying umbrella?
Is it for madam?

1070
01:47:06,035 --> 01:47:07,024
For me.- For you.

1071
01:47:07,203 --> 01:47:08,693
To save myself turning
dark in sun

1072
01:47:08,871 --> 01:47:10,429
What's there to turn dark anymore?

1073
01:47:11,207 --> 01:47:13,767
Looking at my face in
mirror is bad for me.

1074
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:16,303
Sir, madam is coming.

1075
01:47:27,223 --> 01:47:30,989
You've filled my heart.
I've too much flab.

1076
01:47:31,561 --> 01:47:32,050
Brother

1077
01:47:33,229 --> 01:47:38,565
We've been waiting for you
eagerly all these years.

1078
01:47:39,902 --> 01:47:43,133
You've come home like
Goddess of wealth. Come.

1079
01:47:43,573 --> 01:47:47,566
Imagine us a couple and
tell me your comment.

1080
01:47:48,911 --> 01:47:50,469
I feel like seeing
black & white T.V.

1081
01:47:51,748 --> 01:47:53,010
Very poor taste

1082
01:47:56,753 --> 01:47:58,243
Greetings brother.
- Greetings.

1083
01:47:58,421 --> 01:48:01,083
Thank you uncle.
- Okay.- Careful.

1084
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:02,421
Greetings.- Greetings.

1085
01:48:02,592 --> 01:48:04,958
What has brought you here sir?
- Just for the kids.

1086
01:48:05,928 --> 01:48:07,919
I'm first.- No, I'm first.

1087
01:48:09,265 --> 01:48:11,165
Mother!

1088
01:48:16,272 --> 01:48:17,364
Watch out man.

1089
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:37,990
Greetings sir.- Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1090
01:48:38,628 --> 01:48:39,458
Who son are you?

1091
01:48:39,629 --> 01:48:41,961
Greetings sir.
He's Veera Sankar Reddy's son.

1092
01:48:44,467 --> 01:48:47,129
Son...what happened to him?
- What's it?

1093
01:48:47,303 --> 01:48:48,201
What happened to my son?

1094
01:48:48,471 --> 01:48:50,302
Why have you brought him home
instead of taking him to school?

1095
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:54,406
He has hurt his knees.
What happened? How did he get hurt?

1096
01:48:54,644 --> 01:48:56,202
He's hurt here also.
- What happened son?

1097
01:48:56,646 --> 01:48:58,807
What happened tell me?
Anyone beat him in school?

1098
01:48:58,981 --> 01:48:59,970
I'll kill him.

1099
01:49:00,316 --> 01:49:05,310
No sir.
He fell while crossing the road.

1100
01:49:08,324 --> 01:49:11,657
What? Our enemy....

1101
01:49:12,829 --> 01:49:16,890
The name that makes us
go sleepless at night

1102
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:20,101
He has saved the
life of my son?

1103
01:49:21,003 --> 01:49:22,095
Let he may be our enemy,

1104
01:49:23,005 --> 01:49:25,030
he has given a new lease
of life to our son.

1105
01:49:25,341 --> 01:49:27,775
Or else we would be
mourning his death now.

1106
01:49:28,344 --> 01:49:32,371
When I walk on street
in future,

1107
01:49:32,682 --> 01:49:38,712
I've saved your son who will
conduct your funeral rites,

1108
01:49:39,355 --> 01:49:44,383
If Indrasena Reddy teases me.
What would I do then?

1109
01:49:45,027 --> 01:49:46,790
When he grows up,

1110
01:49:47,196 --> 01:49:51,860
when others say your life was
saved by Indrasena Reddy.

1111
01:49:52,368 --> 01:49:54,859
If he turns Prahalad and
I become Hiranyakashyap,

1112
01:49:55,037 --> 01:49:56,402
and Indra becomes Lord Vishnu,

1113
01:49:57,039 --> 01:49:59,200
he'll kill me taking the
incarnation of Narasimha.

1114
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:00,535
What'll you do now?

1115
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:03,702
I don't want a son living
on the life saved by enemy.

1116
01:50:04,046 --> 01:50:06,708
No...listen to me...no.

1117
01:50:10,219 --> 01:50:11,049
Son!

1118
01:50:34,076 --> 01:50:39,309
Take this body and put it in the
courtyard of Indra's house.

1119
01:50:39,749 --> 01:50:43,651
Tell him I don't want
a life saved by him.

1120
01:50:44,086 --> 01:50:45,747
Go...take the body.

1121
01:50:50,426 --> 01:50:54,089
Brother Indra!

1122
01:51:37,807 --> 01:51:40,037
What made your father to chose
this name for you,

1123
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:42,368
to kill an innocent boy?

1124
01:51:43,145 --> 01:51:47,912
Unable to look into my eyes,
you killed a boy?

1125
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:54,312
Son...son...my son

1126
01:51:55,825 --> 01:51:57,053
I'll kill you.

1127
01:51:59,161 --> 01:52:02,255
If you take a step further,
I'll kill you.

1128
01:52:09,005 --> 01:52:10,267
Here is your son.

1129
01:52:17,346 --> 01:52:22,079
If my saving your son had
become a curse to your son

1130
01:52:22,852 --> 01:52:23,841
Please forgive me.

1131
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:28,753
I was sad because he didn't allow me
to see the face of my dead son.

1132
01:52:29,358 --> 01:52:31,519
You saved my son's life earlier,

1133
01:52:31,694 --> 01:52:35,152
Now you've brought him
for the last glimpse.

1134
01:52:35,698 --> 01:52:37,893
I must bow in your honor.

1135
01:52:38,367 --> 01:52:41,768
Why are you watching your wife
praising our enemy?

1136
01:52:42,872 --> 01:52:45,363
Don't show your anger on women.

1137
01:52:45,541 --> 01:52:48,704
Show it...on...me.
- Are you ready?

1138
01:52:48,878 --> 01:52:52,871
Are you dumb struck?
If you've guts, come out, let's decide.

1139
01:52:53,049 --> 01:52:57,042
What you'll decide.
He's my son. I killed him.

1140
01:52:57,219 --> 01:52:59,244
Why are you bothered about it?
- Your son?

1141
01:52:59,889 --> 01:53:01,789
Did you carry, deliver and
took care of him?

1142
01:53:03,893 --> 01:53:07,260
You'll cry mother, if I stab you.
But you've stabbed a mother's heart now.

1143
01:53:08,064 --> 01:53:10,931
You and your brothers know only
about knife wounds.

1144
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:15,666
A women loses her symbols of
marriage on her husband's death.

1145
01:53:17,907 --> 01:53:20,467
With death of a son losing everything,
look how a mother is crying.

1146
01:53:20,743 --> 01:53:24,406
Can you bring back
the life of her son?

1147
01:53:25,081 --> 01:53:27,140
You can't.

1148
01:53:29,085 --> 01:53:32,486
But, I'll give her
memories of her son.

1149
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:35,921
What are you watching?
Cone on, go ahead.

1150
01:53:55,444 --> 01:53:56,308
My son...my son.

1151
01:54:29,145 --> 01:54:35,084
My son...my son...my son.

1152
01:54:38,654 --> 01:54:42,556
You may have lost
your son physically.

1153
01:54:43,159 --> 01:54:44,683
But his soul remains in
this holy basil plant.

1154
01:54:45,661 --> 01:54:47,322
Pour water everyday
and look after it

1155
01:54:47,997 --> 01:54:51,831
As the plant grows
remember your growing son,

1156
01:54:52,001 --> 01:54:54,094
and he must remember his sins.

1157
01:54:54,503 --> 01:55:00,373
You must bow every day
in your life.

1158
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:02,910
If you allow it
to die in pride.

1159
01:55:03,345 --> 01:55:05,176
I'll kill you all 5 brothers.

1160
01:55:19,195 --> 01:55:23,188
If you uproot the plant,
I'll kill you.

1161
01:55:41,717 --> 01:55:44,151
Hey, who are you?
Why are you barging into house?

1162
01:55:45,054 --> 01:55:45,713
She's not talking to me.

1163
01:55:49,725 --> 01:55:51,158
Who are you? Why are you
sitting in this chair? Get up.

1164
01:55:53,062 --> 01:55:56,896
This is Indra's chair. We too
never sit in it. Get up.

1165
01:55:57,399 --> 01:55:59,560
Is your Indrasena Reddy
such a great man?

1166
01:55:59,735 --> 01:56:00,759
Lift your head and
look there.

1167
01:56:02,071 --> 01:56:06,303
Indra, you're a walking thunder.

1168
01:56:06,742 --> 01:56:08,767
Indra, you've lightning eyes.

1169
01:56:11,747 --> 01:56:13,578
You didn't get up on my order.

1170
01:56:13,749 --> 01:56:15,307
Now, you've got up
on your own.

1171
01:56:15,918 --> 01:56:21,413
Not only she any girl it is state
will et up or seeing Indra.

1172
01:56:43,946 --> 01:56:46,540
I am...- Siva Reddy's daughter.

1173
01:56:47,783 --> 01:56:50,684
Name is Snehalatha Reddy.
- How did you know?

1174
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:53,816
Is it my resemblance
to my father?

1175
01:56:54,123 --> 01:56:56,956
No, looking at your arrogance.

1176
01:56:59,461 --> 01:57:00,450
Why did you come here?

1177
01:57:00,629 --> 01:57:03,564
I came here to tell you,
I'll marry a man I love.

1178
01:57:03,966 --> 01:57:08,699
The man you love in my place
...that too in my house.

1179
01:57:09,972 --> 01:57:10,461
Who is he?

1180
01:57:11,473 --> 01:57:12,235
You!

1181
01:57:13,809 --> 01:57:16,300
What did you like in me?

1182
01:57:16,478 --> 01:57:20,312
I liked the courage of walking into
enemy's house like a lion.

1183
01:57:21,817 --> 01:57:25,309
I liked your manliness
in threatening my brothers.

1184
01:57:25,487 --> 01:57:26,317
Any thing more?

1185
01:57:26,488 --> 01:57:28,820
I liked your
leopard like eyes.

1186
01:57:29,158 --> 01:57:31,718
I liked your Greek statute body

1187
01:57:32,328 --> 01:57:34,387
I liked your walking style.

1188
01:57:34,997 --> 01:57:40,867
In fact I like every
part of your body.

1189
01:57:41,503 --> 01:57:43,869
But I must like you, mustn't I?
- What do I lack?

1190
01:57:44,006 --> 01:57:46,998
I'll not marry any one
other than you.

1191
01:57:47,176 --> 01:57:50,543
Don't put conditions.
You'll remain a spinster.

1192
01:57:52,848 --> 01:57:56,215
If I don't marry you by
coming 5th lunar month.

1193
01:57:56,852 --> 01:57:58,843
My name henceforth shall
not be Snehalatha Reddy.

1194
01:58:04,193 --> 01:58:04,852
What?

1195
01:58:05,194 --> 01:58:08,357
Did you feel like seeing me
again watching my walk?

1196
01:58:08,697 --> 01:58:11,188
I wanted to give you a
taste of our traditions.

1197
01:58:11,867 --> 01:58:16,236
It's our tradition to honor any
woman entering our home.

1198
01:58:17,206 --> 01:58:18,036
Sister

1199
01:58:27,883 --> 01:58:29,874
I'll take it as bridal sari
presented by groom.

1200
01:58:30,386 --> 01:58:32,786
I'll wear it for our marriage.

1201
01:58:38,227 --> 01:58:41,663
I feel they are playing a game
again using a woman.

1202
01:58:42,898 --> 01:58:44,593
She has come from
America recently.

1203
01:58:45,234 --> 01:58:47,065
She wouldn't have taken
to that family's tradition.

1204
01:59:28,108 --> 01:59:31,509
Oh the winter cold is killing me.

1205
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:53,531
Oh! The young man is going
berserk in chill weather.

1206
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,461
Your beauty is a symphony.

1207
01:59:55,635 --> 01:59:57,466
turning my cheeks red.

1208
01:59:57,637 --> 02:00:01,869
...spread a bed of flowers, my dear.

1209
02:00:54,027 --> 02:00:57,690
Baiting me with your beauty,
you've incited desires in me.

1210
02:00:57,864 --> 02:01:01,857
Vanish like moon
in daytime, oh maiden.

1211
02:01:02,035 --> 02:01:05,869
With your laser sharp eyes
piercing through my clothes.

1212
02:01:06,706 --> 02:01:09,869
How am I to cope with
a unrepentant heart?

1213
02:01:10,043 --> 02:01:13,877
Shall I come in coolly and
turn your nights hot?

1214
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:18,044
Storm the fort of my heart,
oh my dear.

1215
02:01:26,226 --> 02:01:29,753
Oh! The young mischievous girl
taken over me

1216
02:01:34,234 --> 02:01:37,761
Oh shyness has taken
the back seat.

1217
02:02:18,111 --> 02:02:21,945
With your mischief
sneaking into my heart.

1218
02:02:22,115 --> 02:02:25,778
If you lit fire of passion
how am I to douse it?

1219
02:02:25,952 --> 02:02:29,786
In the cot of moonbeam
on the bed of jasmine,

1220
02:02:29,956 --> 02:02:33,949
Isn't it tragic to put a
wall between us, dear?

1221
02:02:34,127 --> 02:02:37,961
Sneak in stealthily
and break into me.

1222
02:02:38,131 --> 02:02:41,794
Give in yourself to me,
Oh my dear.

1223
02:03:54,138 --> 02:03:56,572
Give me a comb.
I want to comb my hair.

1224
02:04:00,477 --> 02:04:03,241
Oh why did he give
a knife for a comb?

1225
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:05,141
Thank god, I didn't tell him to comb.
He would've taken my head.

1226
02:04:05,482 --> 02:04:07,643
This is Rayalaseema
not Konaseema.

1227
02:04:07,818 --> 02:04:09,251
Don't they use combs here.

1228
02:04:12,489 --> 02:04:16,152
Did you go to any function?
You didn't inform us.

1229
02:04:16,660 --> 02:04:20,494
Who is this new relative to call you
leaving your sisters-in-law?

1230
02:04:20,664 --> 02:04:23,599
I didn't go to any function
but to Indrasena's house.

1231
02:04:24,835 --> 02:04:26,860
Why did you go there?
- To meet the groom.

1232
02:04:29,673 --> 02:04:33,336
I went on my own. I love him.
I want to marry him.

1233
02:04:33,510 --> 02:04:34,408
He rejected me.

1234
02:04:34,845 --> 02:04:37,678
If it's possible go to him and
make him agree to this marriage.

1235
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:46,854
She should be asking the
head of our father's killer.

1236
02:05:06,043 --> 02:05:09,240
You rush for everything
with your minute brain.

1237
02:05:09,546 --> 02:05:12,709
Who is she?
Our sister, our blood.

1238
02:05:13,384 --> 02:05:15,545
She has got traits
of her maternal aunt.

1239
02:05:15,886 --> 02:05:20,721
She'll take revenge; she'll not
share her bed with him.

1240
02:05:29,066 --> 02:05:30,328
You were born for people.

1241
02:05:31,568 --> 02:05:35,732
Let you be blessed
with long life.

1242
02:05:37,741 --> 02:05:39,732
Come out. Why are you
still inside?

1243
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:41,138
We've caught you in whites.

1244
02:05:56,927 --> 02:05:57,484
Wait, we'll show you.

1245
02:05:57,928 --> 02:05:58,917
Brother Indra

1246
02:06:03,934 --> 02:06:05,026
Every one must be happy.

1247
02:06:16,947 --> 02:06:18,380
What's this?

1248
02:06:18,615 --> 02:06:22,711
People don't have a drop of water
to quench thirst there.

1249
02:06:23,287 --> 02:06:27,053
But here pots of water are
going down the drain.

1250
02:06:27,624 --> 02:06:30,058
Don't know what's all
the fun is for.

1251
02:06:30,127 --> 02:06:32,186
What are you blabbering?
Go and mind your work.

1252
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:34,119
Wait.

1253
02:06:34,965 --> 02:06:38,799
Sir...I unwittingly
passed a comment,

1254
02:06:38,969 --> 02:06:40,402
Forgive me sir.
- Nothing wrong in it.

1255
02:06:41,305 --> 02:06:44,536
Tell me, why you said that?
What's your problem?

1256
02:06:45,309 --> 02:06:48,301
People are finding it
difficult without water.

1257
02:06:48,479 --> 02:06:51,004
It rained heavily recently.

1258
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:53,138
It's a drought hit region.

1259
02:06:53,484 --> 02:06:58,421
Any rain will vaporize like
water on hot pan.

1260
02:06:58,989 --> 02:07:01,651
Rainwater should
be stored in a place

1261
02:07:05,829 --> 02:07:08,229
Sir, Indrasena Reddy is coming.

1262
02:07:10,667 --> 02:07:12,157
Greetings Collector.
- Greetings, please come in.

1263
02:07:14,505 --> 02:07:15,494
Come in...sit down.

1264
02:07:17,341 --> 02:07:18,501
If you had sent a message,
I would've come to you.

1265
02:07:18,675 --> 02:07:19,664
You took trouble to come here.

1266
02:07:19,843 --> 02:07:21,572
I can go anywhere for
people's welfare.

1267
02:07:21,845 --> 02:07:22,903
What do you want me to do?

1268
02:07:23,347 --> 02:07:27,511
I want a reservoir to be built
here to store rainwater.

1269
02:07:27,684 --> 02:07:30,346
Or else we can't put up a dam
to stop the flow of tears.

1270
02:07:30,521 --> 02:07:33,354
Government had proposed
it long time back.

1271
02:07:34,191 --> 02:07:35,351
But...- Money?

1272
02:07:35,692 --> 02:07:38,183
I'll finance it.
People will donate on my call.

1273
02:07:38,362 --> 02:07:40,023
Money is not the problem.- Then?

1274
02:07:40,364 --> 02:07:44,801
The land for reservoir belongs
to Siva Reddy brothers.

1275
02:07:45,369 --> 02:07:46,267
They are refusing.

1276
02:07:46,703 --> 02:07:50,139
We tried in all our ways.
They have refused forthrightly.

1277
02:07:50,874 --> 02:07:54,139
Govt. is helpless in this issue.
Unable to do anything.

1278
02:07:54,378 --> 02:07:56,141
I can do it.

1279
02:07:56,547 --> 02:08:00,881
You arrange a meeting
between two villages.

1280
02:08:01,051 --> 02:08:01,949
If they refuse...

1281
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:05,711
Govt. will not rule here.

1282
02:08:06,223 --> 02:08:08,555
My power will rule
the roost here.

1283
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:15,824
What's this Mr. Collector?
We are busy people.

1284
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:17,765
You invited us.
We had come.

1285
02:08:18,402 --> 02:08:21,633
Where is Indrasena Reddy?
Come on, get up.

1286
02:08:32,249 --> 02:08:35,412
Hail Indrasena Reddy!

1287
02:08:35,586 --> 02:08:36,109
Sit down.

1288
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:38,512
He'll think we got up
in respect for him.

1289
02:08:39,923 --> 02:08:48,092
Hail Indrasena Reddy!

1290
02:08:48,265 --> 02:08:51,098
I think this man will make my
brothers-in-law to lose their honor.

1291
02:08:51,768 --> 02:08:52,996
Greetings Collector.- Greetings.

1292
02:09:01,778 --> 02:09:03,939
Why did you call us?

1293
02:09:04,114 --> 02:09:07,106
Nothing sir, it's an issue everyone knows.
For building the reservoir.

1294
02:09:07,284 --> 02:09:10,151
We are not ready to offer
our lands a platter to you.

1295
02:09:10,454 --> 02:09:13,480
Are they working
for free for us?

1296
02:09:14,124 --> 02:09:15,455
Why should we give it
free of cost?

1297
02:09:15,626 --> 02:09:16,786
No need to donate

1298
02:09:17,461 --> 02:09:20,157
Quote your price.
I'll get it for you.

1299
02:09:20,797 --> 02:09:23,129
Compensation?
Govt. is running on credit.

1300
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:25,894
I don't know when it'll sanction.
Will you compensate it?

1301
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:27,027
I will.

1302
02:09:27,471 --> 02:09:28,631
Don't break your promise.

1303
02:09:28,805 --> 02:09:30,966
Did I ever go back on my word?

1304
02:09:31,141 --> 02:09:34,633
Give your 1000 acre orange orchard
for our 1200 acres of land.

1305
02:09:36,146 --> 02:09:36,805
How can it be equal?

1306
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:38,971
Yours is barren land
Indra's land is fertile.

1307
02:09:39,149 --> 02:09:42,312
This is injustice.
According to govt. rate...

1308
02:09:42,486 --> 02:09:45,319
No need of Govt. rates if you
like okay or else we are going.

1309
02:09:45,489 --> 02:09:46,148
Stop.

1310
02:09:46,657 --> 02:09:50,821
No sir...- I'll accept their proposal.
Please sit down.

1311
02:09:53,330 --> 02:09:55,264
I own 200 acres of the land.

1312
02:09:55,499 --> 02:10:00,994
I want your ancestral
house for my share.

1313
02:10:08,845 --> 02:10:09,607
Okay

1314
02:10:09,846 --> 02:10:13,839
You've to give me barites fields
& calcium factories.

1315
02:10:14,017 --> 02:10:15,416
I'll sign only then.

1316
02:10:17,854 --> 02:10:20,755
I agree to give you.

1317
02:10:21,358 --> 02:10:25,192
Now, it's your turn Veerabhadra Reddy.
What did you want?

1318
02:10:25,362 --> 02:10:27,956
You warned my father not
to enter this region.

1319
02:10:28,198 --> 02:10:33,295
You must leave this region
for my signature.

1320
02:10:44,715 --> 02:10:46,376
Please calm down.
- Please calm down.

1321
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:50,042
We are ready to give up
water but not you.

1322
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:54,054
Yes...yes.

1323
02:10:54,224 --> 02:10:57,057
You've given up your wealth.
But you're our wealth.

1324
02:10:57,227 --> 02:10:59,889
You shouldn't accept
and leave this place.

1325
02:11:00,063 --> 02:11:02,054
No...no...you shouldn't go.

1326
02:11:02,232 --> 02:11:03,597
Did you hear them?

1327
02:11:04,568 --> 02:11:08,129
If you've any respect for me.
Please sit down.

1328
02:11:11,074 --> 02:11:13,907
I'll go away from here.

1329
02:11:15,245 --> 02:11:18,339
But after the completion
of the reservoir

1330
02:11:19,082 --> 02:11:20,071
Prepare the documents.

1331
02:11:24,921 --> 02:11:25,410
Stop brother

1332
02:11:25,922 --> 02:11:29,619
Don't women have a right
in ancestral property?- They have.

1333
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:35,755
Why not? We own 1000 and
you own 200 acres.

1334
02:11:35,932 --> 02:11:38,423
You mean, I should also sign
the document, shouldn't I?

1335
02:11:38,602 --> 02:11:39,261
Of course yes.

1336
02:11:39,936 --> 02:11:43,167
I too have a condition
for my signature.

1337
02:11:44,274 --> 02:11:48,370
I don't have any thing left
with me other than my hands.

1338
02:11:48,779 --> 02:11:51,942
Those empty hands are enough
to tie the knot with me.

1339
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:02,724
No...Indrasena, I fear
there's treachery in it

1340
02:12:02,959 --> 02:12:06,451
Brothers have come with
a sister to out smart you.

1341
02:12:06,630 --> 02:12:09,463
Listen to me, don't accept
this proposal.

1342
02:12:09,633 --> 02:12:11,294
Yes, sister is right.

1343
02:12:26,650 --> 02:12:31,087
As I had promised,
after the completion of reservoir,

1344
02:12:31,988 --> 02:12:35,754
I'll marry her and
leave this place.

1345
02:12:39,329 --> 02:12:42,093
That like a real man.

1346
02:12:42,833 --> 02:12:45,768
Take out the documents.
I'll sign it.

1347
02:13:36,317 --> 02:13:38,751
Achieving the grace
of Lord Shiva,

1348
02:13:39,153 --> 02:13:41,348
Brining down to earth
the celestial Ganges,

1349
02:13:41,656 --> 02:13:46,355
...he consecrated it with
his sweat as the milk.

1350
02:13:46,994 --> 02:13:49,326
An edifice that will stand
test of time for generations.

1351
02:13:49,497 --> 02:13:51,761
Bringing prosperity to people,

1352
02:13:51,999 --> 02:13:56,663
he is on a penance to make
sage Bhagirath look small.

1353
02:13:57,338 --> 02:14:02,105
An emperor, he worked
like an ordinary worker

1354
02:14:02,176 --> 02:14:07,341
Leaving royal pleasures he marched
stride by stride with poor.

1355
02:14:07,515 --> 02:14:12,714
When people's hearts are
bubbling with happiness.

1356
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:17,855
When the salty tears
are turning sweet,

1357
02:14:18,025 --> 02:14:23,122
bringing a new life to take
root in people's lives,

1358
02:14:23,364 --> 02:14:28,461
...making a drought area
turn into green pasture

1359
02:14:28,703 --> 02:14:33,265
There's no stopping
when the people rule the roost.

1360
02:14:33,874 --> 02:14:38,402
Stopped the Ganges flowing
into sea,

1361
02:14:38,879 --> 02:14:43,873
Checked the flow and impounded
the power of labor.

1362
02:14:44,051 --> 02:14:49,216
This dam is witness to our dreams
come true standing for eternity.

1363
02:14:49,390 --> 02:14:51,722
Now the barren lands
will turn fertile

1364
02:14:51,892 --> 02:14:59,765
Our dreams will come true with
the grace of our leader.

1365
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:04,894
Lit the lives of people
spreading with new hope.

1366
02:15:05,239 --> 02:15:10,176
Let there be streams of water
in the drought prone zone.

1367
02:15:31,098 --> 02:15:48,608
Hail Indra!

1368
02:15:48,783 --> 02:15:49,340
I'll take leave now.

1369
02:15:52,119 --> 02:15:53,108
With your grace.

1370
02:15:53,287 --> 02:15:57,018
Every poor man living here will
be happy all his life

1371
02:15:57,458 --> 02:15:58,686
You've kept your promise.

1372
02:16:01,629 --> 02:16:04,564
I think he has forgotten.
He has to keep another promise.

1373
02:16:04,799 --> 02:16:08,064
Tell your brothers to arrange
the engagement tomorrow.

1374
02:16:35,294 --> 02:16:36,955
Hey Naganna stop

1375
02:16:39,464 --> 02:16:41,227
Have you lost your brain?

1376
02:16:41,633 --> 02:16:43,498
Sir.- Bloody idiot.

1377
02:16:44,136 --> 02:16:45,569
Don't we know to offer
him a seat?

1378
02:16:46,471 --> 02:16:50,237
Doesn't' he know where a landlord
and a coolie will sit?

1379
02:16:50,809 --> 02:16:53,903
Go and bring the mats,
he'll sit on it.

1380
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,845
Do we've to bear
all these insults?

1381
02:16:57,316 --> 02:16:58,578
Do you want me to
break a promise?

1382
02:17:00,652 --> 02:17:03,314
I feel it's like god visiting
a devil's house.

1383
02:17:05,824 --> 02:17:08,054
Indrasena Reddy, please sit down.

1384
02:17:29,848 --> 02:17:31,679
Am I wrong?

1385
02:17:31,850 --> 02:17:35,946
We are here for an engagement
not for wordy duels.

1386
02:17:36,855 --> 02:17:38,083
Fix the marriage.

1387
02:17:41,526 --> 02:17:46,088
We are waiting anxiously
for that moment.

1388
02:17:50,535 --> 02:17:51,763
Bring my sister.

1389
02:18:01,046 --> 02:18:01,705
Come dear.

1390
02:18:08,887 --> 02:18:09,649
Sit down.

1391
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:13,118
Why are you thinking?

1392
02:18:14,559 --> 02:18:19,553
Do you feel it is insult to
your future husband to sit here?

1393
02:18:20,065 --> 02:18:21,396
They are now a poor family.

1394
02:18:21,566 --> 02:18:25,468
They have to live on your
mercy from now.

1395
02:18:26,571 --> 02:18:27,799
Sit down...dear...

1396
02:18:35,914 --> 02:18:37,404
Why are you sitting on ground?

1397
02:18:38,417 --> 02:18:41,580
I'll not live in bungalow after
marrying him, will I?

1398
02:18:41,753 --> 02:18:44,347
...in a poor hut
there won't be any chairs.

1399
02:18:44,589 --> 02:18:45,681
I'll get used to it.

1400
02:18:50,595 --> 02:18:51,926
Fix the date & time, priest.

1401
02:18:52,097 --> 02:18:54,691
Like aunt like niece.

1402
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:59,434
Priest, select a good time.
It must help us.

1403
02:19:00,105 --> 02:19:04,599
Sir, Friday of 5th lunar Month
at 10.30 am is very auspicious.

1404
02:19:04,776 --> 02:19:05,435
Impossible

1405
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:08,511
He must marry and leave tomorrow
as he had promised.

1406
02:19:09,114 --> 02:19:10,172
Fix it tomorrow.

1407
02:19:10,615 --> 02:19:13,778
It'll not suit. Tomorrow is
inauspicious for marriage

1408
02:19:13,952 --> 02:19:17,183
It'll be good for us.
Fix it at 10.30 AM tomorrow.

1409
02:19:17,622 --> 02:19:20,182
They are very interested.
Fix it.

1410
02:19:20,625 --> 02:19:21,387
One minute

1411
02:19:22,127 --> 02:19:24,857
I want to talk to
Indrasena alone.

1412
02:19:34,306 --> 02:19:38,208
I've not yet married her,
she's calling me to the room.

1413
02:19:39,311 --> 02:19:39,970
Bye...

1414
02:19:40,979 --> 02:19:42,640
Don't worry.

1415
02:19:42,814 --> 02:19:45,476
Jumping into decisions is your
family trait not for his family's

1416
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:47,481
He's a man of character.
Now start worrying.

1417
02:19:47,652 --> 02:19:48,482
Get lost.

1418
02:19:51,156 --> 02:19:55,490
Have you got anything to ask which
your brothers forgot to ask?

1419
02:19:55,660 --> 02:19:56,217
Yes

1420
02:19:57,829 --> 02:19:58,420
What's it?

1421
02:19:59,831 --> 02:20:00,559
Your life.

1422
02:20:03,502 --> 02:20:04,025
Do you want now?

1423
02:20:06,671 --> 02:20:08,104
I want you.

1424
02:20:09,841 --> 02:20:12,674
Thinking I'll take your
life like my aunt,

1425
02:20:12,844 --> 02:20:14,573
My brothers have fixed
this marriage.

1426
02:20:15,013 --> 02:20:18,005
My brothers appeared like gods
when I came here from America.

1427
02:20:18,850 --> 02:20:21,375
I thought you were
our family's enemy.

1428
02:20:21,853 --> 02:20:26,119
But, you saved my nephew's life,
and my brother killed him.

1429
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:30,795
I understood the difference
between our two families.

1430
02:20:32,697 --> 02:20:35,029
I know you agreed to marry
not for me.

1431
02:20:35,534 --> 02:20:37,525
But for poor people.
I know that.

1432
02:20:38,203 --> 02:20:40,535
I want you.
I want your love.

1433
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:46,273
Show me the at least little affection
which you've for the people.

1434
02:20:53,885 --> 02:20:55,079
This is not a drama.

1435
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:59,212
If you still suspect me,
the invitation...

1436
02:21:04,396 --> 02:21:10,232
...it'll bring us together
in matrimony.

1437
02:21:10,902 --> 02:21:15,498
After the marriage,
not as a sister of rich brothers,

1438
02:21:16,741 --> 02:21:18,174
you must come as the
wife of a poor man.

1439
02:21:46,735 --> 02:21:50,171
Oh my dear, I'm mad about you.

1440
02:21:50,406 --> 02:21:53,739
Youthful desires are
troubling me.

1441
02:21:57,913 --> 02:22:01,405
Oh! My romantic cook.
Cook up a hot feast for me.

1442
02:22:01,583 --> 02:22:05,178
Serve me hot my dear.

1443
02:22:05,421 --> 02:22:09,118
Falling to your charm,
I promised to marry you.

1444
02:22:09,425 --> 02:22:14,590
Taking me on cloud nine,

1445
02:22:14,763 --> 02:22:18,255
the fun has reached a
crescendo, oh my dear.

1446
02:22:18,434 --> 02:22:21,995
Oh! He has responded
positively to my call.

1447
02:23:14,823 --> 02:23:18,384
When a gentle breeze blew,
I said no.

1448
02:23:22,331 --> 02:23:25,823
I'm getting irritated
on seeing jasmine.

1449
02:23:37,346 --> 02:23:44,684
With every passing day my desires
are getting boiled up.

1450
02:23:44,853 --> 02:23:52,419
today, I'm all fired up.

1451
02:24:49,751 --> 02:24:53,619
My hips are wailing with
unfulfilled desires.

1452
02:24:57,092 --> 02:25:00,687
When a beauty is
lighting fire in me.

1453
02:25:12,274 --> 02:25:19,442
You must become all mine.

1454
02:25:19,615 --> 02:25:27,181
But it refused to hear you.

1455
02:26:03,623 --> 02:26:05,614
You are our only sister.

1456
02:26:07,461 --> 02:26:11,795
If god asks to make a choice
between you & our family.

1457
02:26:11,965 --> 02:26:13,296
We'll select you.

1458
02:26:14,301 --> 02:26:18,067
I'll return all the
Indra's property to you.

1459
02:26:21,141 --> 02:26:25,009
You & Indrasena needn't go
on exile. We'll go on exile.

1460
02:26:26,313 --> 02:26:27,746
My dear sweet little sister.

1461
02:26:28,648 --> 02:26:31,811
It's bad for family
if a girl cries.

1462
02:26:32,819 --> 02:26:35,754
Go my dear. Be happy.
...keep smiling.

1463
02:26:36,323 --> 02:26:36,812
Go...

1464
02:26:43,997 --> 02:26:44,827
Why are you all indifferent?

1465
02:26:44,998 --> 02:26:47,489
Indrasena had killed our father.
Have you forgotten it?

1466
02:26:47,667 --> 02:26:51,694
Killing ourselves is better than giving
our sister in marriage to him.

1467
02:26:52,339 --> 02:26:54,569
I'm Siva Reddy's son.

1468
02:26:56,343 --> 02:26:58,903
I killed my son for enmity.

1469
02:26:59,846 --> 02:27:02,838
My word and my deeds are
two different things

1470
02:27:04,351 --> 02:27:07,184
They work individually
on their own.

1471
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:10,854
You just keep watching
the proceedings.

1472
02:27:11,691 --> 02:27:12,851
At last I found the best man for you.

1473
02:27:13,026 --> 02:27:14,516
Put a dot for him.- Is it?

1474
02:27:14,694 --> 02:27:16,855
I'm ready.
- Why to enjoy feast?

1475
02:27:21,201 --> 02:27:25,535
I promised to wear this sari
for my marriage.

1476
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:29,201
I agreed to get you married
as per your wish.

1477
02:27:30,210 --> 02:27:31,142
Sari doesn't matter.

1478
02:27:32,546 --> 02:27:34,207
Brother, bring the documents.

1479
02:27:34,381 --> 02:27:36,872
Let all the evil eyes cast on you
be warded off.

1480
02:27:45,392 --> 02:27:48,486
Indra, my brothers-in-law
returned these documents

1481
02:27:48,895 --> 02:27:52,831
Dog will eat leftovers not man.
- You're right.

1482
02:27:53,233 --> 02:27:57,567
My brother-in-law insisted
to bring the groom in Benz car.

1483
02:27:57,737 --> 02:27:59,637
No need of it, take it back.

1484
02:28:00,407 --> 02:28:02,898
It's tradition for the
bride's people to send car.

1485
02:28:03,243 --> 02:28:04,904
Don't refuse and
hurt their sentiments.

1486
02:28:05,412 --> 02:28:06,845
We will go in car. Come let's go.

1487
02:28:07,747 --> 02:28:09,305
Where are you going?

1488
02:28:09,416 --> 02:28:10,781
You are my best man.
You come along with me.

1489
02:28:19,759 --> 02:28:23,923
Offer prayers in temple to bring
down curtains on our enmity

1490
02:28:24,931 --> 02:28:26,796
Be happy. Go with her.

1491
02:29:13,146 --> 02:29:18,812
Sister...sister! Brother-in-law.

1492
02:29:26,326 --> 02:29:26,917
Brother-in-law

1493
02:31:18,605 --> 02:31:20,436
What's it?
What happened?

1494
02:31:20,774 --> 02:31:23,971
Indrasena is killing
Siva Reddy's brothers.

1495
02:32:59,038 --> 02:32:59,595
Brother

1496
02:33:03,376 --> 02:33:06,402
Look, how he has turned it
into a graveyard.

1497
02:33:07,046 --> 02:33:10,413
Have you understood now
the man you love?

1498
02:33:12,552 --> 02:33:15,544
Brother...brother...

1499
02:33:15,722 --> 02:33:19,283
Bring a car immediately to
take brother to hospital.

1500
02:33:20,059 --> 02:33:21,617
Nothing is left in me now.

1501
02:33:22,061 --> 02:33:23,426
Now, this is an
enmity between people.

1502
02:33:25,064 --> 02:33:30,058
I don't know the reaction of
our people for this.

1503
02:33:30,236 --> 02:33:32,761
This is not people's enmity,
but my personal enmity.

1504
02:33:33,072 --> 02:33:35,836
I'll avenge Indrasena Reddy.

1505
02:33:38,745 --> 02:33:42,078
Keeping away from
that gory of blood,

1506
02:33:42,248 --> 02:33:45,411
he brought up niece and
nephew in Kasi,

1507
02:33:45,752 --> 02:33:47,515
...and was trying to
forget the part.

1508
02:34:12,111 --> 02:34:16,605
Such a great man were you living
like an ordinary man amongst us?

1509
02:34:16,950 --> 02:34:19,282
Please forgive us if we'd
done anything unwittingly.

1510
02:34:19,452 --> 02:34:22,444
Don't be apologetic and
make me a great man.

1511
02:34:22,789 --> 02:34:23,687
Allow me to remain normal.

1512
02:34:23,957 --> 02:34:28,951
Sankar, you're a great man.

1513
02:34:39,138 --> 02:34:40,127
Start the car.

1514
02:34:44,310 --> 02:34:47,473
Doctor.- Nandhini.
- She's out of danger.

1515
02:34:50,149 --> 02:34:52,913
Unable to bear her marriage
getting stopped she tried...

1516
02:34:54,487 --> 02:34:57,650
Stopping of her marriage is not
the reason for her suicide...

1517
02:34:59,492 --> 02:35:00,857
...she's pregnant.

1518
02:35:17,176 --> 02:35:17,938
Calm down

1519
02:35:36,696 --> 02:35:37,958
No uncle...no

1520
02:35:38,531 --> 02:35:43,559
I committed a grave sin
despite brought up by you.

1521
02:35:44,871 --> 02:35:51,242
Allow me to kill.
Kill the fetus of our enemy.

1522
02:35:53,046 --> 02:35:53,774
You're wrong dear.

1523
02:35:54,881 --> 02:35:57,247
Killing one's own offspring is
their family tradition

1524
02:35:58,051 --> 02:36:01,543
Saving the life of an enemy's child
is our family's duty

1525
02:36:02,722 --> 02:36:03,882
Calm down - Uncle.

1526
02:36:06,726 --> 02:36:14,223
Till I'm here you or your child
will not get injustice.

1527
02:36:16,069 --> 02:36:19,596
Indrasena, you'll come to
Rayalaseema after us.

1528
02:36:20,073 --> 02:36:23,406
Not to live but...
...to die in our hands

1529
02:36:53,606 --> 02:36:59,602
Hail Brother Indra!

1530
02:37:44,490 --> 02:37:46,481
Brother, it seems Indrasena
has come back.

1531
02:37:46,659 --> 02:37:48,320
We had done all this
for his return only.

1532
02:38:23,029 --> 02:38:25,395
When a man you're
expecting comes,

1533
02:38:26,199 --> 02:38:28,793
You must feel happy
why are you surprised?

1534
02:38:29,535 --> 02:38:32,197
Did you think I'll not come or
I'll not be able to come.

1535
02:38:32,705 --> 02:38:34,070
We expected you'll come.

1536
02:38:35,374 --> 02:38:39,401
This is the place where
you killed my father.

1537
02:38:40,046 --> 02:38:42,412
This is the place where you
spilled my brothers blood.

1538
02:38:43,216 --> 02:38:46,413
You must die here.
That's why I brought you here.

1539
02:38:47,887 --> 02:38:51,721
Did you think I've become
ascetic staying in Kasi?

1540
02:38:52,558 --> 02:38:56,551
Did you think Varanasi
would've changed me?

1541
02:38:57,396 --> 02:39:00,490
The same blood
and the same anger!

1542
02:39:01,067 --> 02:39:03,968
Why are you standing &
talking to him? Sit down.

1543
02:39:33,099 --> 02:39:40,267
Sitting on throne is right of Indra
in heaven and it's my right here.

1544
02:39:58,124 --> 02:40:01,560
What's this? It thought you'd
come with weapon here.

1545
02:40:01,794 --> 02:40:02,954
But you've come
with women.

1546
02:40:03,296 --> 02:40:07,164
There's lot of difference between
battle and function.

1547
02:40:08,801 --> 02:40:14,034
You're not yet married
and still a virgin.

1548
02:40:14,307 --> 02:40:15,467
How can you know
the difference?

1549
02:40:15,975 --> 02:40:16,839
I know the difference.

1550
02:40:17,476 --> 02:40:28,250
I was all decked up as bride
and expecting the man I love,

1551
02:40:29,155 --> 02:40:32,522
When you came to the marriage
knocking off my brothers heads.

1552
02:40:33,492 --> 02:40:35,653
How can a woman remain
a woman after that?

1553
02:40:38,164 --> 02:40:47,197
I'm not here to tell you why
I did like that and marry you.

1554
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:54,673
Indrasena Reddy isn't married.
Who are you?

1555
02:40:54,847 --> 02:40:56,337
His concubine?

1556
02:40:58,351 --> 02:41:01,411
One must be lucky to become
Indra's concubine also.

1557
02:41:01,854 --> 02:41:03,412
I'm not that lucky.

1558
02:41:03,856 --> 02:41:06,757
I'm going after him
just for one glance.

1559
02:41:11,197 --> 02:41:12,186
What are you staring at me?

1560
02:41:12,698 --> 02:41:15,758
I'm not one to get scared of stares.
I wasn't born elsewhere.

1561
02:41:16,369 --> 02:41:18,633
I'm a Rayalaseema native,
Chennakesava Reddy's daughter.

1562
02:41:19,205 --> 02:41:22,971
I'm fearless.
Let me put the dot.

1563
02:41:23,876 --> 02:41:28,973
It's Indrasena's niece Nandhini's
baby shower function at 5 Pm today.

1564
02:41:29,548 --> 02:41:30,913
Come and bless her.

1565
02:41:31,217 --> 02:41:33,708
You're a chaste woman
and she's a chaste wife,

1566
02:41:33,886 --> 02:41:35,376
and it's baby shower function.

1567
02:41:35,554 --> 02:41:36,782
Should we come & bless her?

1568
02:41:37,223 --> 02:41:37,712
If we refuse to come

1569
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:41,257
Neither famine nor earth quake
will hit Rayalaseema,

1570
02:41:41,894 --> 02:41:42,918
The man who must come is...

1571
02:41:50,236 --> 02:41:53,069
You cheated me by
lying you're an orphan.

1572
02:41:53,906 --> 02:41:55,396
That was your first mistake.

1573
02:41:56,242 --> 02:41:58,904
You cheated Nandhini
saying you love her.

1574
02:41:59,578 --> 02:42:00,806
That was your second mistake.

1575
02:42:01,914 --> 02:42:03,609
Don't commit the third mistake.

1576
02:42:04,583 --> 02:42:11,147
You must come and put bangles to
your wife Nandhini at 5 PM.

1577
02:42:15,261 --> 02:42:16,819
He'll not come.

1578
02:42:18,597 --> 02:42:19,586
He will come.

1579
02:42:19,765 --> 02:42:20,595
If we stop him

1580
02:42:22,601 --> 02:42:29,097
If he doesn't come, I'll kill all
and take him with me.

1581
02:42:29,275 --> 02:42:31,175
Are you threatening to
kill me in my own home?

1582
02:42:32,278 --> 02:42:33,267
Not only in your own home,

1583
02:42:33,446 --> 02:42:35,107
I'll come to any district
of Andhra Pradesh,

1584
02:42:35,281 --> 02:42:39,274
any place, any center
any house, I'll come.

1585
02:42:39,618 --> 02:42:42,451
Once I start killing I'll not
see who is my enemy.

1586
02:42:44,957 --> 02:42:47,323
What are you watching?
Stop him.

1587
02:42:52,965 --> 02:42:54,523
You've come without weapon.

1588
02:42:55,634 --> 02:42:57,465
Let me see how you can
go out from here.

1589
02:42:57,636 --> 02:43:01,732
People like you need weapons.
For me....this is enough.

1590
02:43:02,475 --> 02:43:03,305
I'll hack you.

1591
02:43:03,476 --> 02:43:07,003
Challenge! - If it's a challenge,
I'll take your head in a jiffy.

1592
02:43:35,939 --> 02:43:37,634
Brother, still 30 minutes only.

1593
02:43:38,275 --> 02:43:42,041
One second is enough
to win or lose.

1594
02:43:42,279 --> 02:43:46,613
Sharpen your weapons,
pick up your axes.

1595
02:43:47,117 --> 02:43:49,278
Start the ritual of sickles.

1596
02:43:49,786 --> 02:43:52,778
Today at 5, a 12 year
vengeance will come to an end.

1597
02:43:54,624 --> 02:43:58,116
Are you taking him to America
fearing Indrasena?

1598
02:43:58,295 --> 02:44:01,389
No, I'm taking him to Indrasena.

1599
02:44:01,798 --> 02:44:05,063
Is it my sister who is talking now?
- What happened to you?

1600
02:44:05,969 --> 02:44:07,732
I've come to know the truth.
- What's the truth?

1601
02:44:07,971 --> 02:44:11,304
You ordered the killing of Indra's
sisters & their husbands.

1602
02:44:11,475 --> 02:44:14,308
Lie...it's a blatant lie.
Who told you?

1603
02:44:14,644 --> 02:44:15,201
It's me.

1604
02:44:21,651 --> 02:44:22,675
Surprised?

1605
02:44:22,986 --> 02:44:28,014
You left me to die but Indra
saved me before leaving to Kasi.

1606
02:44:30,327 --> 02:44:32,420
Are you surprised at my courage?

1607
02:44:32,662 --> 02:44:36,496
Indra is in this region.
No one can harm me now.

1608
02:44:38,001 --> 02:44:39,662
Stop...stop

1609
02:44:39,836 --> 02:44:41,997
If you hadn't killed
his family members,

1610
02:44:42,172 --> 02:44:43,434
I wouldn't have lost my husband.

1611
02:44:44,007 --> 02:44:47,670
If you want to leave them also
as widows. Do as you wish.

1612
02:44:48,678 --> 02:44:50,009
Sneha, you go.

1613
02:44:52,015 --> 02:44:54,040
Stop...stop

1614
02:44:54,684 --> 02:44:58,711
What happened to women of
this house? I'll kill you.

1615
02:44:59,022 --> 02:45:01,855
Though I was born much later
than you. I too was born here.

1616
02:45:02,025 --> 02:45:07,190
I too know to kill not only you.
Start the car.

1617
02:45:14,371 --> 02:45:17,863
Catch them and kill them.
Start the vehicles.

1618
02:45:18,041 --> 02:45:18,803
Come on boys.

1619
02:46:09,926 --> 02:46:10,858
Start the vehicle.

1620
02:47:31,841 --> 02:47:35,675
He's my man.
If any one dares to step forward.

1621
02:47:36,179 --> 02:47:40,013
He'll not have legs to walk
or hands to eat. Come.

1622
02:48:03,873 --> 02:48:11,245
Hack him...hack him.
Why are you carrying sickles?

1623
02:51:12,562 --> 02:51:21,561
Kill him...don't spare.

1624
02:51:21,738 --> 02:51:22,500
Stop.

1625
02:51:25,408 --> 02:51:27,308
If we start felling even
forests will vanish.

1626
02:51:28,077 --> 02:51:29,977
If we start killing
man will vanish.

1627
02:51:30,747 --> 02:51:33,580
How long we are going
to kill each other?

1628
02:51:34,250 --> 02:51:37,413
Let's say no to
revenge and weapons.

1629
02:51:37,754 --> 02:51:39,187
Your families must be happy.

1630
02:51:39,589 --> 02:51:42,183
Your wives mustn't end up
as young widows.

1631
02:51:42,425 --> 02:51:43,915
Rayalaseema must
become a heaven

1632
02:51:44,093 --> 02:51:49,429
Till I'm here, this land must
get wet with rain only

1633
02:51:49,599 --> 02:51:50,998
...not with blood

1634
02:51:53,603 --> 02:51:54,592
Think over it

1635
02:52:13,289 --> 02:52:15,120
Why are you still here?
Didn't you go back to Kasi?

1636
02:52:15,792 --> 02:52:18,158
I've booked two tickets to Kasi.

1637
02:52:18,795 --> 02:52:20,456
I fell in love in Kasi.

1638
02:52:20,797 --> 02:52:22,788
I made a vow to get
married also in Kasi.

1639
02:52:25,134 --> 02:52:27,796
Do you remember this sari?
You presented it to me.

1640
02:52:28,471 --> 02:52:30,462
I promised to wear this
for our marriage.

1641
02:52:31,474 --> 02:52:35,308
This is the auspicious thread
you left with me.

1642
02:52:36,145 --> 02:52:39,137
It is waiting to
reach my neck.

1643
02:52:39,983 --> 02:52:42,975
It's easy to solve public issues.
Let him solve his personal problem.

1644
02:52:43,152 --> 02:52:44,642
He is in for a shock.

1645
02:52:45,154 --> 02:52:47,247
Watch now, whether he gets a shock
or gives other's a shock.

1646
02:52:48,157 --> 02:52:53,254
Come, let's go.
Tie the knot.

1647
02:53:00,837 --> 02:53:07,834
We'll quit violence
we'll follow you.

1648
02:53:08,511 --> 02:53:12,345
Please don't leave us and
go away again.

1649
02:53:12,515 --> 02:53:15,848
I'm your man.
I was born for you.

1650
02:53:16,519 --> 02:53:17,543
I'll live with you only.

1651
02:53:19,856 --> 02:53:21,847
Got a shock of life?

1652
02:53:22,025 --> 02:53:23,185
Really great shock!
You want to share it.

1653
02:53:23,359 --> 02:53:24,690
Watch there.
