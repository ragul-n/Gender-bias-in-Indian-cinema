00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:08,902
Hyderabad....Time:01.10 AM

3
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:10,966
Hello, it's Shankar here.

4
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,133
lt's been a month since l saw you.

5
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,001
Where the hell are you?
- In Subramanyapuram.

6
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,334
What? What did you say now?

7
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:21,499
You heard me right.

8
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:28,838
l'm here for a month to solve the mystey
surrounding this place and it's temple.

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,436
lf you know what l know...
- l wouldn't have let you go there.

10
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:38,038
That's why l came here without informing
our boss in endowments department.

11
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:44,536
l'm writing evemhing l know in a book,
just 10 more pages and it'll be over.

12
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,168
l'll submit it to our dept.
in tomorrow's meeting.

13
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:55,270
lt'll be curtains down for the
Subramanyapuram mystey tomorrow.

14
00:02:55,432 --> 00:03:00,303
Tomorrow you'll know how it'll be
in tomorrow's meeting.

15
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:04,068
End will be as you had imagined.
- As imagined?

16
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,602
College topper Pallavi on mortuay mystey!

17
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:37,170
Night after 12, something is seen from
the 13th window in mortuay ward.

18
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:44,968
13th window means,
l'm sure it's a ghost.

19
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,267
lf l don't go on rounds,
Dean will shout on me.

20
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,968
l'm damn scared to go there at night.

21
00:05:58,432 --> 00:05:59,966
Ghost? My foot! Get lost!

22
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,800
Mortuay? l can't!

23
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:07,234
Your comments on the mystey, sir.
- Can't say anything in particular.

24
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,301
Mortuay is that side only.

25
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:31,101
Why are you acting brave, you coward?

26
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:37,799
ls it necessay, buddy?

27
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,302
l can't sleep l don't find answer
to one question.

28
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,534
But entire college is agog with questions.

29
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,901
lf l don't find it myself,
l can't even eat.

30
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:51,301
5You're arrogant, so you're going,
why should l join you?

31
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:52,900
Leave me alone, boy, l beg you.

32
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,301
lf suspense is laced with comedy,
it's surefire hit formula.

33
00:06:56,532 --> 00:07:08,076
Come.
- Don't know what that is!

34
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,968
Buddy, keep your phone also
in silent mode.

35
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,000
Someone may get up if phone rings.

36
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,401
Dead bodies can't hear sounds, right?

37
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,601
Sory, come.

38
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:26,700
How many corpses here?

39
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:33,699
Hand!

40
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:38,968
Did you save me from it?
Is that what you say now? Come.

41
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,834
l told you to keep it in silent mode, right?

42
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,201
l think this fool is going to kill me tonight.

43
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,136
My friends, what brave Karthik tells you is,

44
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,069
the ghost that appears in our mortuay
after 12 at midnight,

45
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,402
recently mortuay ward was
renovated, right?

46
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,069
They forgot and left a reflector sheet there.

47
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,901
Reflecting...?
- Didn't get it?

48
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:08,701
lt means a big size mirror.
- Mirror?

49
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:15,169
Evey night at 12,
arc lights are switched on,

50
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:20,536
when the light passes the 13th window,
it falls on the mirror

51
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,534
and it reflects back from
the 13th window,

52
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,703
people who saw this reflecting light
got afraid mistaking it as ghost.

53
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,636
Since it is mortuay ward,
people believed it blindly.

54
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,734
This is the background stoy of the ghost.

55
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,701
lt is as l guessed it.

56
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,469
Wow? Had you been there last night,
you wouldn't be here now to say wow?

57
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,000
You devil face!

58
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:45,803
What l say is, there's an answer
to evey question in his world.

59
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,801
1lf there's a question without answer,

60
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,568
the problem isn't the question
but in tying to find it.

61
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,800
Mine too same quotation.

62
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,601
Don't always ty to find an answer
to the question.

63
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:07,601
At times, it may harm your life also.

64
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:11,501
Giving life is better than
Ieaving the question without answer, madam.

65
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:38,171
Question is for liberation...

66
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:39,833
Stop smoking and
start eating chocolates.

67
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,837
lt's good for heart.
- What's life without aim?

68
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,135
Betel leaf acts like spirit, you know that?

69
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,401
Lemon will not give you gas,
you know that?

70
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,100
lt won't give you intoxication,
you know that?

71
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,534
lf you're so scared,
why do you drink?

72
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,600
Why not drink plain water?
You know that?

73
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,466
Give me that, madam.

74
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:04,600
He's buying something to eat.

75
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,834
Sai Baba too was happy to help poor
than spending on temples.

76
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,133
l didn't do it to prove to someone.

77
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,268
Must do something which nobody
tried earlier, that's real thrill.

78
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:46,369
Hey Dhoni! You talk so much of logic
but got out so easily.

79
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,601
This is not logic but calculation.

80
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,501
You'll never change.
- He'll never change. Never!

81
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:05,399
What's it, mother?

82
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:08,434
Today is last day of the college
to the boy, right?

83
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,700
To your brother.
- Yes.

84
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,668
Will this shirt be perFect?
- Did you call me for this, mother?

85
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,599
Hey you!

86
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:16,332
Watch out!

87
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:18,067
Mother-in-law!
Karthikeya is not yet ready, right?

88
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:20,667
Thank God, l'm on time.
l thought shirt selection is over.

89
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,134
Not yet.

90
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,166
ls this shirt okay?

91
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,033
Why T-shirt today, mother-in-law?
- Why?

92
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:27,834
Today is last day in college,
moreover practical exam,

93
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,736
this black full hand shirt will be perFect.

94
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:31,833
PerFect, sister-in-law.

95
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:35,900
Uncle, chocolate.

96
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,734
lncluding that little girl,
there are three women in home,

97
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,836
but what's the use?
Still waiting for coffee since morning.

98
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,336
But they serve him evemhing
from soap to shoe.

99
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,766
Horoscope!

100
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,834
That brings to my memoy,

101
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,135
wait, let me see your horoscope
for today and then go out.

102
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:59,667
No time, l'll hear it tonight.

103
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,834
What's the use of knowing your
horoscope for today at night?

104
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:05,736
Either it is same to us, if it is good,
it's profit or else loss.

105
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:06,766
That is horoscope.

106
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:08,833
What's this, dad?
You too talk like mom.

107
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:09,833
What's this, son?

108
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,467
How are you going to office today, brother?

109
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:13,733
ln car...why?

110
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,302
After getting ready handsomely,
l need to go by car, right?

111
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,835
Ask me anything but car.
- Then, give car keys.

112
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,833
Mother!
- Give me, mother-in-law.

113
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:29,538
lf l see even a scratch on my car, no finds
will be released for your next week's camp.

114
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:32,535
Got it? Be careful.
- Forget about him and his threats.

115
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:33,699
That's because l'm...

116
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,168
Your horoscope today...

117
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:44,407
Great day for Scorpios!
It's vey special day.

118
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,269
Today is vey lucky day because...
- Tell me the matter first.

119
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:51,168
Because knowing your horoscope...

120
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:56,232
Tell me, mother.

121
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,439
Today's your horoscope says you'll meet
a girl who will bring you luck.

122
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:09,703
l see hundred girls evey day,
how can l find my lucky girl from them, mother?

123
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:10,833
You're mad, mom.

124
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:17,339
girls among them are different,
this one girl will be special.

125
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,634
Look at her carefully,
you'll see the difference.

126
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,700
Thank God, got parking place!

127
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,700
Name is Valli.

128
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,901
Never saw you here.
Are you from this campus?

129
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,235
When l saw you just a moment earlier,
l had a vey goo opinion about you.

130
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,867
That's why l'm unable to fight fiercely.

131
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:11,266
Moreover a girl!

132
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:14,501
But brother is more important
than girl, right?

133
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,100
So...
- So?

134
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,534
lt's difficult for you to take it
to workshop for repairs.

135
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,834
lf you pay me, l'll get it repaired.

136
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:23,000
You don't have dialogues in this scene, okay?

137
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,799
l've, right? Listen to me.

138
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:28,469
Come whatsoever it may Scorpio
and Leo will meet!

139
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,866
What's your...
- Shut up!

140
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,401
Pay for repairs and take the keys.

141
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:33,866
l'm up there only.

142
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,169
Don't think you don't need this card,
l'll steal somewhere and leave this card.

143
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,600
Be careful.

144
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,168
During this period, bad omen will
come in between.

145
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:50,501
l lost my ID card and
he lost parking place.

146
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,134
What? Is this also my mistake?

147
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:57,135
When my mother said about lucky girl,
l thought it was you.

148
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,435
lf bad time is on your side,
who can prove lucky to you?

149
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:01,733
Enough of cribbing, get lost.

150
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,502
You got parking place not Priyanka Chopra.

151
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:34,700
Though there may be hurdles
to stop the meeting,

152
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,335
people of these zodiac signs
will be definitely.

153
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:53,335
Stop! No need to fight with the crowd,
Iet them finish.

154
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,500
How come he died astonished?

155
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:04,666
l don't know anything.

156
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,500
Chocolate in lab?
- Wait.

157
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,934
He drew liver for kidney.

158
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,833
Shall l put another one?
- Do it.

159
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,500
Don't waste the chocolate.

160
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,900
What are you boys doing there?

161
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,467
Did you finish your records?
Come on, take out your records.

162
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,335
Take out your record.
- Take out yours.

163
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:55,699
l'm asking you!

164
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:47,043
Hail Babaji!

165
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:50,900
Swamy...Swamy...

166
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:56,702
Where are you taking our Swamy?

167
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,167
Why are you taking him away?

168
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:01,702
Please save Swamy.

169
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,570
How dare you manhandle
our God like Swamy?

170
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,702
lf that God man asks to send your wife
to him tonight, will you send her?

171
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,867
This has your Baba's videos, watch it.

172
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,400
battalion will be here to arrest
his devotees.

173
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,668
lf there are any of his devotees here,
they can go to jail with him.

174
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:46,437
lf you don't have children, go to doctors
not to such fake God men.

175
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,833
Call from endowment department, sir.

176
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,833
Urgent?
- Yes, sir.

177
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,168

tell them l'll come tomorrow.

178
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:04,735
Where are you, Veera?
We've lot of work. Bye.

179
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:13,102
Last exam is over, your car too
got saved from accident, buddy.

180
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,134
The girl you liked turned
Iucky girl for you.

181
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,667
What other reasons you need?

182
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,368
What for?
- Asking me what for?

183
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,300
Recently you emptied my pockets, right?
- Buddy!

184
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:30,435
l had drinks in intoxication.
Please don't waste time.

185
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,566
Just one 90 ml!

186
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,535
Half...stop with it.
- Okay, take it.

187
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,833
lf there's anything, have a blast.

188
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,734
Buddy, ATM card!

189
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:46,835
ATM card and Pan card are same.
- No cash?

190
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,002
l remember having Rs.2000.
But card is not working.

191
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:52,300
No cheque book and
no patience to go to bank.

192
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,903
But it's duty of man to ty till he succeeds,
even for drunkards too.

193
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:00,967
How long?
- Don't wory.

194
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:01,899
There's customer inside, right?

195
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,634
l'm getting late.
- Stand in line.

196
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,701
Will it take time to deposit also?
- It'll take time.

197
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:19,303
Whether you get money or not,
ATM has good AC.

198
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:20,933
Why there's a long queue?

199
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:25,502
May be Rs.500 notes are issued
instead of Rs.100.

200
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:28,701
No madam, two men entered
inside 2 hours ago.

201
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,701
They're not coming out and
not allowing anyone come inside.

202
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:32,333
Why?
- l don't know what to do.

203
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:33,600
This is too much.

204
00:22:58,866 --> 00:22:59,666
Pin number?

205
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:24,433
Come.

206
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:26,900
Come quickly, they'll close happy hours.

207
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,001
Even million eyes are not enough...

208
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,600
Even a lakh hearts are not enough...

209
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:38,737
To see you, to get closer to you
and to love you...

210
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:44,070
Languages and words are running short...

211
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:49,537
To praise you and to call you...

212
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:54,870
Let time create any hurdle,
myjourney will never end with you...

213
00:23:55,032 --> 00:24:00,170
You entered through my eyes into
my heart and become my life...

214
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,404
You dived deep into me for pearl...

215
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:10,337
You turned into a flawless diamond...

216
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:21,276
l dived for flawless diamond
and found you...

217
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:33,600
Karthik, you'll get out on first ball,
watch out!

218
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,704
Looking at me...smiling at me...
Cutting my heart into pieces...

219
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:10,134
Why do you enlarge the distance
between us?

220
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,901
Why this distance between us?

221
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:18,103
The words hearts knows
don't come on lips...

222
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:23,437
When you appear before me,
l get nervous...

223
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:28,737
When you're before me,
l'm lost in day dreams...

224
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:33,870
l'm floating in dream
and with you...

225
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,904
You drowned me with your
gentle rain of love...

226
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:44,670
You entered my life like spring...

227
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,701
Commissioner?
He's in a meeting on the right side.

228
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,500
Sir, he's in a meeting.

229
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,369
This is Bhairava temple of Bobbarlanka
in East Godavari district.

230
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:13,300
lt is in ruins now.

231
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,969
For the past l days a wonder
is happening...

232
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:22,000
l've an appointment at 11 am.

233
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,935
Can you please wait for 5 minutes,
l'll finish this meeting.

234
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:32,702
The fact is that for the past l days,

235
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:38,404
evey day a dog is coming to the temple
and circumambulating the temple tower.

236
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:43,335
Observing this, people in the village started
coming to the temple to see this spectacle.

237
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:48,069
People of neighbouring villages came
to know about this and started coming there.

238
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:51,535
This automatically raised the
income of the temple.

239
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:54,433
The temple may see the golden days again.

240
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,971
As this was happening, few people,
l mean atheists,

241
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:04,068
said the dog as circling disease,
and has mass hysteria,

242
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,700
they're spreading messages like this,

243
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:11,737
we're not asking through media that
people must have faith in God,

244
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:16,069
l'm asking media not to belittle
the faith of theists.

245
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:25,541
So, any news against this temple coming
on TV or print media,

246
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:29,636
it's our responsibility to see it doesn't come
and hurt the sentiments of the believers.

247
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:36,138
Because if temple prospers,
the village will also prosper, that's all.

248
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:43,900
Sory, l made you wait.

249
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,299
Tell me.

250
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:46,400
That is...

251
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:48,066
Sir, temple offering.
- From which temple?

252
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:48,899
Palani, sir.

253
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:51,599
Give me little.

254
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:52,600
Sir, for you.

255
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:55,733
Tell me, sir.

256
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:58,500
Case file of Shankar who worked
in your department.

257
00:28:58,733 --> 00:28:59,900
He died recently.

258
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,601
His residence comes under my station limits.

259
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:04,934
l need your signature for closing the case.

260
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,901
This is snake bite but not accidental.

261
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,700
Then? Murder?

262
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:28,835
You're saying it indirectly
and say direct.

263
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:34,836
Shankar is with Endowments department
for the last 5 years,

264
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,102
he's an article writer in my department,

265
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:43,267
his articles appeared in many magazines,

266
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:47,503
he used to come to a conclusion
after deep study only.

267
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,201
He requested for long leave
about 2 months ago,

268
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:54,235
but l came to know later that he
had gone to Subramanyapuram,

269
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,867
and that he invited death himself.

270
00:29:57,332 --> 00:30:00,334
You may have doubt about inviting
death on going to that place.

271
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,668
There's a temple dedicated
to Lord Subramanya Swamy.

272
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,736
Recently the temple was closed due
to some untoward incidents.

273
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:13,002
Ever since then anyone who tried
to open the temple or solve the mystey,

274
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:14,065
....are dying!

275
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:15,900
Particularly dying with snake bites.

276
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:20,600
Shankar too went there to find
the truth and died.

277
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:25,968
lf there's any more in your stoy,
tell it to my constable,

278
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,601
l need only your signature,
l've lot of work.

279
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:33,002
l didn't tell to believe me,
l just gave you information, that's all.

280
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,267
Sister-in-law, pack this too.

281
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,435
ls medical camp compulsoy
for the course?

282
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,834
Nothing like that, sister-in-law.
We go voluntarily,

283
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:48,103
we're sent as groups to places
where there are no medical facilities.

284
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,167
Not mandatoy but...

285
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,900
l'll gain experience too.

286
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,102
Why are you so dull as if l'm going
to space or war, mother?

287
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:06,768
What's this, mother?
Come with me why are you so sad?

288
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:10,836
No son, you never been away from
home for so many days.

289
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,235
You're going to faraway place, so...

290
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:16,835
How far the place may be?
l've phone and car with me to come.

291
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,067
Why do you wory about me, mom?

292
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:20,800
Which place are you going to?

293
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,701
Subramanyapuram!

294
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:33,172
Allot any place to any team but allot
Subramanyapuram to Karthik group.

295
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:35,734
Why are you so particular about
that village, sir?

296
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:41,304
For Karthik's curiosity and
for his arrogance,

297
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,836
he would go to that village but
will not come back from there.

298
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:51,003
Recently astrologer brought your horoscope,

299
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:54,902
he warned that you've danger from snakes,

300
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,867
You stopped at a fantastic place, Karthik.

301
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:48,899
Location is great!

302
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,166
Why did we stop now?

303
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:52,900
Hey tar barrel, empty your bladder.

304
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,268
Oh valley! l'm scared of valleys.
Come this side.

305
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:58,500
Let's pee here.

306
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:08,267
Won't you go to pee?
- You cary on.

307
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,834
Take as many photos as you can now.

308
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,967
What's this shock enty of a mad man
on entering the place?

309
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:54,002
ln cities mad men are locked in hospitals
but roam freely in rural places.

310
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,267
We're here, right?
Let's take care of them.

311
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,667
Don't know what's he?

312
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,267
Welcome to Subramanyapuram

313
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:15,667
May God bless you to visit again

314
00:34:24,432 --> 00:34:25,800
Open the umbrella.

315
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:27,499
Welcome sir.

316
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,534
We're waiting for you since morning.

317
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,400
l didn't tell you, right?
My name is Veeraraju.

318
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:35,836
l'm village head for the past 4 years.
Elected unopposed.

319
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,601
l can judge it on seeing her.

320
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,300
Why are you staring like that?

321
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:40,967
Unload the baggage.

322
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,200
What about our lodging?

323
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,599
Hold my glasses.

324
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:50,170
Go around the village, see all the houses,
any house you select is yours.

325
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:52,701
Anywhere? We must all stay
together in one place.

326
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:56,202
But no house so big to
accommodate all of you.

327
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:58,167
We must all stay together in one place.

328
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:00,534
You mean boys and girls stay
in one place?

329
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,435
He's my worker Amulet.
- Amulet?

330
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,704
For good or bad or for any disease,
he gives an amulet.

331
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:11,833
Will it work?

332
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:13,933
Where do we stay now?

333
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:18,369
To stay together in one place....
there's one place...

334
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:21,800
Temple trustee's bungalow!

335
00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:28,967
So many reactions!
Is it haunted by ghosts?

336
00:35:29,165 --> 00:35:33,269
Nothing like that.
But the house is vacant for a year now.

337
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,567
2 months ago...
- Do you've any objection?

338
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,936
Why should l've objection?
- Then, send someone to clean it.

339
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:41,600
Nobody will go there.

340
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:44,932
Give me the keys.

341
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,534
ls it any girl to appear sexy?

342
00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:36,166
This is a haunted bungalow.

343
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:39,502
Life will be interesting if we stay
in such bungalows.

344
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,535
We must be alive to make
life interesting, right?

345
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:45,835
lf you like stay with me,
if you're scared live in village.

346
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,202
Would anyone who wants
to live stay here?

347
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,667
We're not brave enough to stay here,
we're going back to village.

348
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,867
Are you still here?

349
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:59,569
How can l leave you?
- Evey friend is necessay...

350
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:28,300
How much time will it take to clean
this palatial bungalow?

351
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:30,134
For me an hour!

352
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:35,503
You dot maker?
- Amulet man!

353
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:37,733
He said nobody will come here,
why did you come here?

354
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,801
l came because nobody else will.

355
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,535
Since you're here,
stay with us, don't go away.

356
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,669
How could he build such a big bungalow
amidst this thick forest?

357
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,601
How well he has built in those times?

358
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:53,668
Windows are like doors!

359
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:11,304
lf this bungalow is like this in day time,
how about in night? It's scaring me.

360
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:15,101
Buddy....buddy...

361
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:18,701
Buddy!

362
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,667
lt looks like original.

363
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:34,067
This is just like me.

364
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:41,566
Will you kill me?

365
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,133
l'll beat you with slippers.

366
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:47,333
Come...

367
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:48,966

369
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:52,167
Bloody dirty face!

370
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,836
l thought just that room,
entire building is scay.

371
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:04,699
Nothing...
- Don't scare me.

372
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:05,933
Already l'm too scared.

373
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:12,700
You see people drawing on roads
and seeking alms,

374
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:14,968
l think someone like him had
stayed here.

375
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,700
lt's not a drawing but dead body.

376
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:24,302

- l'll do it.

377
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,933
My name is Mohan.

378
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,836
Sir, l'm friend of ED employee Shankar.
- So what?

379
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,303
A snake bite killed my friend recently.

380
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:12,868
Case is also closed, then?

381
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:17,569
Shankar called myjust 2 minutes
before he died.

382
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:20,700
Called you and...

383
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:26,871
He told he's in Subramanyapuram and was
writing a book on some closed temple there.

384
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:30,535
Suddenly l heard a strange noise
in my phone.

385
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:34,403
Call got cut.

386
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:35,433
What do you want to say now?

387
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,437
You may get any new information if you
see the book he was writing he died.

388
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,768
Do you've that book?
- No, sir.

389
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:45,702
After Shankar's death, his wife went
to back to her parents' house.

390
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:47,234
She's having that book.

391
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,700
Where?
- Kadiri.

392
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,933
Do it fast, useless fellows!

393
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,367
You're vey sharp,

394
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:14,299
Say cheese!

395
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:21,235
Buddy, medical camp is happier
than that bungalow.

396
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:23,434
l'll sleep here at night.

397
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:39,599

398
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:42,732
Take it.

399
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:43,733
One more tea please.

400
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:49,001
This village, camp area,
environment here,

401
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,266
evemhing is perFect!

402
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:53,167
But something's missing here.

403
00:41:53,366 --> 00:41:54,166
Valli?

404
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:59,102
Her eyes...her smile!

405
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:01,133
The double tooth when she smiles!

406
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:03,667
She'll have it removed, buddy.
She's a dental doctor, right?

407
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:06,101
Shut up! That's her beauty spot.

408
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:09,733
l'm unable to forget her.

409
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:13,401
Sir is yearning for someone.

410
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,701
The person is near to him.

411
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,367
That person is in Hyderabad.

412
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:20,268
Hyderabad is 600 miles away from here.

413
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,600
Goddess Mother will never lie, sir.

414
00:42:26,499 --> 00:42:27,099
God bless you, sir.

415
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:30,601
Go, sleep on empty stomach.
Go.

416
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,901
Will you encourage such people too?

417
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:35,834
l didn't give money for her words
but her age.

418
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:37,500
Would you like to have another tea?

419
00:42:38,566 --> 00:42:40,567
Munna, one more tea please.

420
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:54,299
That's Valli!

421
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,203
lf not hallucination,
just think with common sense.

422
00:43:00,366 --> 00:43:01,800
Why would Valli be in the bus
to this remote place?

423
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:02,666
That's Valli!

424
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:06,732
Mother!

425
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:08,333
Mother! Is it vey urgent?

426
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:09,900
No, good news.

427
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:11,500
Good news?
What's that?

428
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:14,400
Your sister-in-law is pregnant.

429
00:43:15,065 --> 00:43:16,132
Give the phone to sister-in-law.

430
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:17,500
Talk to him.

431
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,433
Tell me, Karthik.

432
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,534
Sister-in-law, you gave fantastic news.

433
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,368
l'll call you back in an hour and
give you good news.

434
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:29,335
lf l hear good news,
l'm sure it must be Valli.

435
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:30,266
Start the bike.

436
00:43:47,032 --> 00:43:49,300
Train is coming, give way please...

437
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,867
Buddy, l think that train will
take us faster.

438
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:53,599
Change the gear.

439
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:03,101
What happened?

440
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:05,900
Push...push...

441
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:08,968
Go...go...

442
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:12,966
Push...push...

443
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:16,167
he and his bike!
Moreover dark glasses too.

444
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,834
Looks like he may enter the
bus with bike, stop it.

445
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:24,800
Did you see her?

446
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:27,301
l searched entire bus but didn't find her.

447
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,503
Buddy, let's ask that fatso sitting there.

448
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:37,333
Where did the passengers of this bus go?

449
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,434
When will the bus go again?

450
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:43,133
After people come back.

451
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:46,667
So, you won't leave till the bus is full.

452
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:50,169
Order tea.- No tea, got cigarettes?

453
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:51,566
Got beedis.
- Beedi?

454
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:54,232

458
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,600
Match box?

459
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:11,900
To hell with my fate!

460
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:34,301
Did you come this far from
Hyderabad for me?

461
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,599
From next village.

462
00:45:37,366 --> 00:45:38,600
We came to next village from Hyderabad.

463
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:40,267
Are you here for camp?

464
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:45,769
l requested to allot me that village,
l must curse myself for it.

465
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:49,134
You wantonly got this place
allotted, right?

466
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:53,134
You cleared all our doubts
with your questions.

467
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:03,834
Buddy, we both getting allotted
the same place for camp,

468
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:05,901
is it accidental or act of fate?

469
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,301
Modern time, buddy.
- Neither wonder nor surprize.

470
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,934
Hometown.
- Native place?

471
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:14,500
Start it.

472
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:17,567
What?

473
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,501
You look down on me like dog.

474
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:21,901
l love dogs, please...

475
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:26,735
Your anger is justified,
you stayed back in our first meeting.

476
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:30,502
You don't know what happened
after that and other incidents.

477
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,200
You're my perFect match.

478
00:46:39,432 --> 00:46:43,269
Buddy, you're forgetting your strength
by becoming lover boy.

479
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:44,867
Do l've such a thing?

480
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:47,000
Yes, comedy is your strength.

481
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,702
Girls fall flat for comedy.

482
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:57,267
Then, shall l crack jokes?

483
00:46:57,499 --> 00:47:01,269
lf you do come without proper situation,
comedy will become tragedy.

484
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:06,803
For comedy to flourish,
use an idiot as scapegoat.

485
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,100
Not me, someone else!

486
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:17,605
Look at the world around you,
our scapegoat will appear typical.

487
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:27,001
Watch my act now! l'll rock!

488
00:47:27,899 --> 00:47:30,735
Buddy, look at that man in saffron clothes.

489
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:36,069
Look at him make bravado statements
about knowing world's future with an almanac.

490
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:40,568
He can't wear his dhoti properly and
it seems he'll tell future of others.

491
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:45,267
Buddy, girls will fall flat for your comedy.

492
00:47:46,632 --> 00:47:48,867
Watch now, l'll give him a shock.

493
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,836
Astrologer, please come here.
- Me?

494
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,534
Come...please.

495
00:47:55,432 --> 00:47:58,468
Buddy, l'll show you film...
- Old man will get the stick from me.

496
00:47:58,632 --> 00:48:00,500
l'll make you whistle, buddy.

497
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:03,900
Father, sit here.

498
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:05,967
He called me, dead.

499
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:08,100
l mean we called you to sit next to her.

500
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:21,434
Did it stop?
- l stopped it.

501
00:48:25,532 --> 00:48:27,300
What's my strength?
- Comedy.

502
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,500
Do you know l've strength?

503
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:45,067
This case isn't as easy as l thought.

504
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,800
What happened inside, sir?

505
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:51,667
Greetings.
- Greetings, please sit down.

506
00:48:51,899 --> 00:48:52,532
Come, sir.

507
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,400
Wait a minute, l'll get it.
- Okay.

508
00:49:08,299 --> 00:49:12,302
Take away that ill-fated book,
it'll be good riddance.

509
00:49:15,432 --> 00:49:16,499
His mother.

510
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:21,870
She heard people saying that he died
because he wrote this book,

511
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:23,399
it has affected her mentally.

512
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:28,270
But truth is he wrote the book
with great love and care.

513
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:32,603
lf this book helps you,
what more can l ask?

514
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:33,733
Take it with you.

515
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:34,833
Bye madam.

516
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:38,067
Be careful.

517
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:42,133
l'll not allow anything to happen
to the book.

518
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:44,567
l didn't say be careful with the book.

519
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:45,599
lt was for you!

520
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:56,200
Start the vehicle.

521
00:49:56,366 --> 00:49:57,834
What's the problem?
- Stomach.

522
00:49:58,299 --> 00:49:59,900
For her, third month.

523
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:01,933
ls it? Please come and sit here, madam.

524
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,699
My sister-in-law is also pregnant.

525
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:07,136
Though you've morning sickness,
don't stop eating.

526
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:09,734
The better you eat now,
the better it is for baby's future.

527
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:13,435
We're not here for delivey
but abortion.

528
00:50:16,232 --> 00:50:20,069
Doctor in next town scanned and
said it's a girl.

529
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:22,033
l told him to abort it and
he asked Rs.10000.

530
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,401
lt seems you do it for free, so we're here.

531
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,701
Do you like to for it, madam?
- What can that foolish lady say?

532
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:28,700
Abort it.

533
00:50:29,165 --> 00:50:31,800
Don't say remove it.
It's not a tumour to remove it.

534
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:33,701
lt's life!
That too a girl!

535
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,301
That's why l'm telling you to remove it.

536
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,034
Why do you think it's a hurdle?

537
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:39,000
ln what way girls are inferior to boys?

538
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:42,067
lf you educate them, girls are the ones
who'll take care of you in future.

539
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:43,432
How can you understand our difficulties?

540
00:50:43,566 --> 00:50:46,702
lf you're in s many difficulties,
don't go for abortion, stop having sex.

541
00:50:47,432 --> 00:50:52,170
Just one phone call is enough
to send you and that doctor to jail.

542
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,968
You'll spend all your life in jail.
Shall l call police?

543
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:55,698
Shall l?

544
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:57,499
Look here,

545
00:50:57,666 --> 00:51:01,836
instead of living with this idiot,
you can live happily with your daughter.

546
00:51:02,032 --> 00:51:04,901
Girls are not safe on roads, buses
and colleges,

547
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,334
if mother's womb is also turns
unsafe for girls,

548
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:08,299
where will she go?

549
00:51:10,532 --> 00:51:12,267
lf he changes okay or else ditch him,

550
00:51:12,432 --> 00:51:15,501
because you need your daughter
more than him in future.

551
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:18,633
Go.

552
00:51:33,265 --> 00:51:35,900
This scene benefited two people.
- Two people?

553
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:42,071
One was that lady and another, look there!

554
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:15,905
How many wonders in such a short time...

555
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:22,305
How many mistakes habitually...

556
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:29,271
l can't see you directly...

557
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:36,104
l saw you hiding behind screen...

558
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:44,038
Are you my life span or my wish?
Are you my breath to last all my life?

559
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:51,372
Are you an unwritten song?
Who are you like an imagination?

560
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:39,139
l feel smile was born for you only...

561
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:45,371
lf you share your love, it'll be grateful...

562
00:53:45,499 --> 00:53:52,606
l've fallen for you,
l don't care who you may be...

563
00:53:52,766 --> 00:54:00,006
l don't know if l've the patience or not
but this night must stay standstill...

564
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:47,672
She appears docile and soft...

565
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:54,839
When she's alone by herself,
she's mind boggling...

566
00:54:54,966 --> 00:55:01,272
l don't know about past but
now it's festival when l meet you...

567
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:07,271
You've taken over my dreams...

568
00:56:45,933 --> 00:56:49,236
When South India was together
as Dravida Nadu,

569
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:53,002
this place was ruled by Rashtrakoota kings,

570
00:56:53,165 --> 00:56:59,804
King Kirthivarma of that period built
a marvellous temple for Lord Subramanya.

571
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:02,500
On the first full moon day after
the temple was built,

572
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,801
few minutes after the dark,

573
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:06,901
a big flash of light emanated
from the temple,

574
00:57:07,065 --> 00:57:09,434
villagers were astonished,

575
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,703
since the temple was dedicated
to Lord Subramanya who appeared there,

576
00:57:13,866 --> 00:57:19,037
they considered the light as his presence and
celebrated festival for 21 days after that night,

577
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,169
on the 21st day they celebrated the
consecration of Lord grandly,

578
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:24,633
they used to end the festival.

579
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,137
Light appeared on the full moon day
of Karthika month evey year,

580
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:32,268
and 21 days of festivities became custom,

581
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:35,767
though kings and kingdoms changed,

582
00:57:35,899 --> 00:57:40,403
thought many Mughal kings tried to conquer
the temple or demolish it,

583
00:57:40,532 --> 00:57:41,432
they could never succeed,

584
00:57:41,866 --> 00:57:45,202
Dutch, Portuguese, Britishers came,

585
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:49,470
but the festival in the month of Karthika was
celebrated as usual with pomp and splendour.

586
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,370
Temple trustee build a small palace
for their stay in the forest,

587
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:57,902
they used to stay in the bungalow
whenever they visited the temple.

588
00:57:58,065 --> 00:58:01,301
as time passed, temple's fame reached
Iength and breadth of the nation,

589
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:03,367
since the income in the temple
grew by leaps and bounds,

590
00:58:03,532 --> 00:58:06,034
Endowments dept. took over
temple's administration.

591
00:58:06,499 --> 00:58:09,335
Last year of the full moon day
of Karthika month...

592
00:58:11,399 --> 00:58:12,066
What?

593
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:14,534
Emergency case, sir.

594
00:58:15,032 --> 00:58:17,501
Your phone is switched off, so...

595
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:24,535
Can't do from here,
l need to visit that place.

596
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:28,567
Don't irritate me,
can't you understand if l say once?

597
00:58:28,733 --> 00:58:29,733
How can you say like that?

598
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:32,601
You said you love me
that's your feeling.

599
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:34,201
l don't like you, that's my feeling.

600
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,901
But you praised me that day.

601
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,333
l appreciated your good work not you.

602
00:58:38,499 --> 00:58:42,102
lf this pig had done that l would've
reacted the same way.

603
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,167
You please don't react overly.

604
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,199
Caste problem?

605
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:55,135
l've stopped eating chicken for your sake.

606
00:58:58,366 --> 00:58:59,667
Would you please let me go?

607
00:59:06,332 --> 00:59:07,166
Don't you know to speak Telugu?

608
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:25,132
What happened?

609
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:28,535
l thought something else for these gestures.

610
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:31,968
But when asked she said she'll react
the same for this pig also.

611
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:34,034
l don't mind if she says pig,
but you say...

612
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:35,333
You make my drink.

613
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:44,967
l wanted to have a peg and
sleep peacefully but...

614
00:59:46,899 --> 00:59:48,667
Where are you going?
- To buy drinks.

615
00:59:49,265 --> 00:59:50,332
Drinks at this hour?

616
00:59:50,432 --> 00:59:53,168
We're doctors, it won't be good
if we drink in day time.

617
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:54,700
Okay, get me a biyani.

618
00:59:56,232 --> 00:59:57,299
Be careful.

619
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,299
Who is he?

620
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:06,599
Kick again.

621
01:00:13,899 --> 01:00:14,566
Come here.

622
01:00:15,165 --> 01:00:16,766
That amulet man!

623
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:18,599
Come here quickly.

624
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:20,966
What are you doing here?

625
01:00:22,232 --> 01:00:23,066
Not inside?

626
01:00:23,232 --> 01:00:26,468
Outside is comfortable to me.
- Adding us also?

627
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:27,899
Where can l get liquor here?

628
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:30,100
Difficult here.
- Then, let's go to next village.

629
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:31,967
lt's vey difficult to go there.

630
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:46,168
Tell him to stop the bike,
vey urgent to use pot.

631
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,034
Stop...stop...

632
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,267
Ups and downs has shaken up my bowels.

633
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,501
Go, finish it quickly.

634
01:00:55,132 --> 01:00:56,500
Thanks.
- Go man!

635
01:00:58,332 --> 01:01:01,168
Buddy, bridge is bigger than the village.

636
01:01:01,966 --> 01:01:02,900
Come fast, man.

637
01:01:04,532 --> 01:01:06,066
Why is he going towards the bridge?

638
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:08,601
He may do it from there, idiot.

639
01:01:10,065 --> 01:01:12,434
Buddy...
- You too?

640
01:01:14,265 --> 01:01:14,965
Go.

641
01:01:15,766 --> 01:01:17,134
lf you come with me.

642
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:20,368
l think kick has come down,
he started to get afraid.

643
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:21,433
Do it.

644
01:01:21,799 --> 01:01:23,834
Don't you want to pee?
- No.

645
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:26,501
l'll go, am l scared?

646
01:02:23,232 --> 01:02:24,933
Buddy! Who is he?

647
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:25,933
ls he dead?

648
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:29,667
What happened?

649
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:40,667
lt seems police officer is dead.

650
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,300
Do you know the police officer?

651
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,601
He came to my office for a case.

652
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,702
l understood form his behaviour
he was vey sincere officer.

653
01:02:57,099 --> 01:02:58,400
But seeing him like this...

654
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,668
l came to know he was foolish too
along with sincerity.

655
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:08,269
l'm not asking eveyone to
believe in God.

656
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:11,535
But when a series of incidents happen,

657
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:13,534
l don't mind if you don't believe,
we must be vey careful,

658
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:17,269
if not we can't avoid such tragic deaths.

659
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:26,169
l wish such incidents don't happen again.

660
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,268
Spread awareness through your media.

661
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:37,267
Which direction the temple is?
- This direction, sir.

662
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,601
Please solve this problem in
near future, my Lord!

663
01:03:43,432 --> 01:03:45,167
Come...come...

664
01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:47,968
Have you sent his belongings
to Hyderabad office?

665
01:03:48,165 --> 01:03:49,232
Sent evemhing, sir.

666
01:03:49,399 --> 01:03:53,069
Didn't miss anything, right?
- No sir, but...

667
01:03:53,232 --> 01:03:53,865
But what?

668
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:55,599
lt seems they missed a book he had brought.

669
01:03:55,766 --> 01:03:56,967
You put me in trouble, man.

670
01:03:57,532 --> 01:04:00,067
Where the book is now, Lord Easwara?

671
01:05:15,933 --> 01:05:21,305
On the 10th day after the light appeared
on full moon day of Karthika month of 2013,

672
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:27,269
as usual when temple trustee was
offering prayers along with his family,

673
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:29,367
temple trustee suddenly fell down.

674
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:32,600
What happened to the elderly man?

675
01:05:33,866 --> 01:05:38,237
Considering the incident as defacing,
shut the temple for 11 days.

676
01:05:38,399 --> 01:05:39,533
How is it possible, sir?

677
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:45,037
lt's a temple where prayers have been offered
without any interruption for many centuries,

678
01:05:45,165 --> 01:05:47,534
moreover the festival ends in 10 days,

679
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:49,501
how can God be defaced?

680
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:52,335
Tradition is same for man and God.

681
01:05:52,499 --> 01:05:56,669
Whatever you may say, shutting temple
and stopping prayers is impossible.

682
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,268
Then, be prepared for the
bad consequences.

683
01:05:59,432 --> 01:06:02,201
Watch the consequences for failing
to follow customs and traditions.

684
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:03,166
Come.

685
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:11,371
Two days later when the temple was opened
two lovers were found dead with snake bite.

686
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:16,169
Suddenly rumours were spread about
hearing strange voices and cries from the temple.

687
01:06:16,332 --> 01:06:17,599
The voices were heard.

688
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,400
People started talking about
the temple with fear.

689
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,268
Devotees to the temple started
to avoid it.

690
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,401
Particularly in the evening.

691
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:37,169
Chief priest offered evening prayers
without fail.

692
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:39,934
One evening after he offered
evening prayers...

693
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:47,169
You didn't hear when we warned,
in a way you're responsible for these deaths.

694
01:06:48,065 --> 01:06:51,835
Had God been there in the temple,
would there be so many deaths?

695
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,501
Would there be rumours?

696
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:56,868
People are talking whatever they wish!

697
01:06:57,032 --> 01:07:00,502
Fame of the temple has been marred.

698
01:07:01,632 --> 01:07:05,736
With my experience l'm telling you,
there's no God in this temple.

699
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:10,036
lf we keep open a temple without God,
it is bad for us as well as the temple.

700
01:07:10,165 --> 01:07:11,799
That's why?
- Shut down the temple.

701
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:13,300
How is it possible?

702
01:07:13,499 --> 01:07:16,001
This temple has histoy of
hundreds of years,

703
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:21,036
how can we close it down permanently?
- Not permanently, sir.

704
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:26,003
lf Lord Subramanya graces us again
and returns to the temple,

705
01:07:26,132 --> 01:07:31,170
next year on the full moon day of
Karthika month, he'll appear as light!

706
01:07:31,733 --> 01:07:37,839
When the light appears,
we can conduct the customay festival.

707
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:39,199
What if the light fails to appear?

708
01:07:39,366 --> 01:07:41,601
What else?
Shut down the temple permanently.

709
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,666
Oh Lord Shiva!

710
01:07:42,966 --> 01:07:46,302
Why talk about bad omen?
Let's pray only good happens!

711
01:07:46,466 --> 01:07:52,004
We all pray for that only, though we too
don't like but we've to accept this.

712
01:07:52,399 --> 01:07:53,700
Shut the temple.

713
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,901
2 months after the temple was closed,

714
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:04,300
people of the village completely stopped
talking about the temple,

715
01:08:04,499 --> 01:08:10,571
a TV crew which tried to investigate
about the temple died in an accident.

716
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:13,301
People's faith grew stronger.

717
01:08:13,532 --> 01:08:15,667
The real reason for these deaths is...

718
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:34,333
Do you know what's in it?
- You read it, right?

719
01:08:35,466 --> 01:08:37,334
ls it all true?

720
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:41,136
lf this is true, what could be the
real reason for the deaths?

721
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:46,434
All this happened because of
this book...

722
01:08:46,566 --> 01:08:50,303
Buddy, you know about me, right?
- l know, buddy.

723
01:08:50,532 --> 01:08:52,800
You won't sleep if you don't find
answer for one question,

724
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,068
if you see so many questions,
you won't even eat food.

725
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:58,835
But life is much more important
than sleep and food, right?

726
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:01,068
They're villagers, they believe it.

727
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:02,967
We're students of science,
how can we believe it?

728
01:09:03,132 --> 01:09:07,603
You know you're science student,
but the snake doesn't know this, sir.

729
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:39,903
l've a doubt, how come you dress
differently here from city?

730
01:09:42,966 --> 01:09:44,067
Do you drink?

731
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:46,967
l can guess from your face.

732
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:48,399
You drink a lot.

733
01:09:49,165 --> 01:09:50,332
Will you drink before your mother?

734
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:53,501
No chance!
- No chance, right?

735
01:09:53,933 --> 01:09:56,735
That's city, l live alone there.

736
01:09:56,899 --> 01:09:58,967
My father is here so l follow traditions.

737
01:10:05,332 --> 01:10:06,166
What else?

738
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:11,003
Valli, l see anger in your words
but see love in your eyes.

739
01:10:11,799 --> 01:10:13,667
Don't ty to convince by confusing me.

740
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:17,069
My life is not in my hands,
l'll mary the man my father selects.

741
01:10:17,532 --> 01:10:19,133
We belong to an orthodox family.

742
01:10:20,265 --> 01:10:22,734
When hands are with you,
how can your life be not in it?

743
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:24,166
lt's shear madness.

744
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:28,401
Okay, you told me,
l'll talk to your father.

745
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:36,899
Will he come?

746
01:10:37,632 --> 01:10:41,068
He's just an empty vessel
not a man a of word.

747
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:46,599
Can l come in?

748
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,834
Please come.

749
01:10:52,966 --> 01:10:54,233
He has come to my home really.

750
01:10:56,099 --> 01:10:56,599
Please take your seat.

751
01:11:00,532 --> 01:11:03,601
l think l've seen you somewhere.
- In bus stop.

752
01:11:04,566 --> 01:11:06,167
ln bus...tell me.
What do you want?

753
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:10,169
My name is Karthik, l'm here for
medical camp with your daughter.

754
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,067
l want to ask you a thing.

755
01:11:12,866 --> 01:11:13,499
Go ahead.

756
01:11:14,532 --> 01:11:17,668
What exactly is the problem
with your temple?

757
01:11:21,366 --> 01:11:23,134
l can understand your enthusiasm.

758
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:28,336
But it is not good for you and me
to discuss about the temple.

759
01:11:28,499 --> 01:11:30,300
Do you believe the rumours?

760
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:32,601
We believe certain lies without
giving a thought about it.

761
01:11:32,733 --> 01:11:35,102
We hesitate to accept few truths.

762
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,600
That's all, you must believe it.

763
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:39,368
Then, that is not belief but superstition.

764
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:41,934
Just spelling difference between belief
and superstition.

765
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:46,068
But that difference has taken our culture
and tradition back by thousand years.

766
01:11:47,032 --> 01:11:51,169
Why do we need building almanac
for earth which rotates?

767
01:11:51,632 --> 01:11:54,835
How do you fix this as east or west?

768
01:11:55,366 --> 01:11:57,401
People wear tiger nail as dollar
for long life,

769
01:11:57,532 --> 01:12:01,736
but tigers with 1$ nails is
endangered here.

770
01:12:03,632 --> 01:12:06,101
l've answer for all your questions.

771
01:12:06,566 --> 01:12:12,171
But if l tell you're not old enough to
understand it or experience it.

772
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,533
Matter is l love Valli, sir.

773
01:12:18,632 --> 01:12:20,567
When l asked her
she wanted me to talk t!o you.

774
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:22,201
No father...

775
01:12:23,299 --> 01:12:23,932
Tell me.

776
01:12:24,432 --> 01:12:27,001
Actually not that,

777
01:12:27,132 --> 01:12:28,867
l liked Valli when l saw her in Hyderabad,

778
01:12:29,032 --> 01:12:31,501
l proposed to her feeling she too likes me,

779
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:34,602
l know she would accept me
if you don't have any objection.

780
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:38,836
Look, you told me the matter
in short and correctly.

781
01:12:39,032 --> 01:12:41,834
l read people's horoscopes and
fix their marriages.

782
01:12:42,032 --> 01:12:46,903
So l've an idea about when,
how my daughter's marriage will take place.

783
01:12:47,132 --> 01:12:51,503
As an astrologer l can tell
who her future husband will be,

784
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:53,901
but as her father l can't tell anyone.

785
01:12:55,933 --> 01:12:58,268
l'm intelligent, l can understand.

786
01:13:00,499 --> 01:13:02,167
Valli, coffee was excellent.

787
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:06,900
Where is Karthik?
- l don't know.

788
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:10,368
l'll ask the fatso. Where's Karthik?
- l don't know.

789
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:14,100
Where did he go early morning?

790
01:13:41,032 --> 01:13:43,501
God, l'm entering your precinct.

791
01:14:20,232 --> 01:14:21,199
What happened?

792
01:14:59,299 --> 01:15:00,533
You're indeed handsome!

793
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:35,169
What happened?
What happened, buddy?

794
01:15:35,332 --> 01:15:36,933
Snake...dangerous snake!

795
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:39,167
Where?
- Didn't l tell you?

796
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:42,735
Didn't l warn you about it?
- You keep quiet.

797
01:15:43,132 --> 01:15:45,801
Do you believe him?
- l saw here only.

798
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:47,067
Bring him inside.

799
01:15:47,499 --> 01:15:49,667
Come...come l say.
- Trust me.

800
01:15:51,099 --> 01:15:53,301
l saw it.
- Okay, you saw it.

801
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:08,403
Calm down and go to sleep.
- Vey large snake...

802
01:16:11,032 --> 01:16:15,603
Should we cowards watch such films, buddy?

803
01:16:15,699 --> 01:16:17,901
l saw the snake really.

804
01:16:18,065 --> 01:16:21,435
Did you see?
Did you see evemhing?

805
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,700
Did eveyone see it?

806
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:32,668
Shut your gob and go to be.
Go.

807
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:38,168
Hey electrician, do it fast,
how long will you take?

808
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:39,266
lt's almost done, sir.

809
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:41,267
You must give a dose of anti-biotic too.

810
01:16:42,733 --> 01:16:45,068
Hey you, come here.

811
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:45,898
You only!

812
01:16:47,132 --> 01:16:48,700
Why did they all come together?

813
01:16:49,165 --> 01:16:50,299
Any disease break-out?

814
01:16:50,532 --> 01:16:54,535
lt seems you went near the temple
and even tried to enter the temple.

815
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:55,800
l went there casually.

816
01:16:55,966 --> 01:16:59,069
Casual? Are human lives casual to you?

817
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,400
You're doctors.

818
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:04,670
You must save lives not take lives.

819
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,802
okay, why are you talking about
death now, sir?

820
01:17:07,966 --> 01:17:11,302
l heard a stoy about the temple,
just went to see the temple.

821
01:17:11,466 --> 01:17:13,301
You too will become a part of that stoy.

822
01:17:13,532 --> 01:17:15,133
Stop it! You're scaring him.

823
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,067
lf the young man enters the
temple bravely,

824
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:19,601
isn't it good for all of us if the
temple door is opened again?

825
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,134
Get it fast!

826
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:43,504
Don't touch it, it's our village problem,
we'll take care of it.

827
01:17:43,733 --> 01:17:45,101
Get a vehicle.

828
01:17:53,132 --> 01:17:54,066
What sort of people they are?

829
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:56,067
Elderly man, don't leave him.

830
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:07,167
Hey amulet, l'm famished.

831
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:18,068
How is the electrician now?
- He died.

832
01:18:18,566 --> 01:18:19,466
Died?

833
01:18:19,933 --> 01:18:22,602
Matter is there's poison in his body.

834
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:25,134
What did the villagers say about it?

835
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:26,600
ls it new thing to us?

836
01:18:26,733 --> 01:18:29,936
Anyone who talks about the temple dies.

837
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:35,435
Sir, isn't the tamarind rice special to you.

838
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:45,168
What's that look?
Don't you like to see me here?

839
01:18:47,566 --> 01:18:49,367
Mother!
- My darling!

840
01:18:51,232 --> 01:18:54,268
How come you've grown thin?
Is it because of his food?

841
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:01,135
Mother, this is too....
- Wait, son.

842
01:19:01,466 --> 01:19:04,335
Ghee in tamarind rice?
- Only then you'll eat.

843
01:19:08,866 --> 01:19:10,434
When he said on phone
l thought it was just for fun.

844
01:19:10,599 --> 01:19:12,100
He has really brought his family.

845
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:43,901
Congratulations, sister.
Baby must be handsome like me.

846
01:19:44,065 --> 01:19:47,301
Not like you but beautiful like my daughter.

847
01:19:47,499 --> 01:19:48,399
lsn't it?

848
01:20:18,499 --> 01:20:24,905
We were united by an overwhelming
silence of togetherness...

849
01:20:25,132 --> 01:20:31,505
What was destined happened
yet it's like a dream run...

850
01:20:31,632 --> 01:20:38,438
We're together now and
l feel we'll be fine hereafter...

851
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:44,705
My heart says l'm no more there
after this union...

852
01:20:45,599 --> 01:20:51,137
How many wonders in such a short time...

853
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:59,607
How many mistakes habitually...

854
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:12,733
What's it, dear?

855
01:21:14,099 --> 01:21:16,835
l think Sonu has gone out to play again.
l'll go for her.

856
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,268
You wait, he'll go.

857
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,302
Hubby!

858
01:21:25,499 --> 01:21:27,300
Once he sleeps, he'll not get up.

859
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:29,400
You wait here, l'll go for her.

860
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:33,300
Why did she go out to play at this hour?

861
01:22:57,366 --> 01:22:58,667
Where are mother and Sonu, sister-in-law?

862
01:22:59,566 --> 01:23:02,001
Sonu went out to play,
your mother went looking for her.

863
01:23:02,165 --> 01:23:03,266
At this hour?

864
01:23:05,766 --> 01:23:08,935
Where's grandma?
Don't know?

865
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:11,300
Where's grandma?

866
01:23:47,566 --> 01:23:48,633
Lord!

867
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:52,701
Why did you get scared, mother?

868
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:54,933
Come.
Come.

869
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:56,899
Let's go upstairs.

870
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,201
People say l'm brave like you,
how can you get scared, mother?

871
01:24:00,366 --> 01:24:03,869
Don't know why but there's no peace
in this bungalow.

872
01:24:04,032 --> 01:24:09,103
l feel something is wrong with
snake design on rook and this idol.

873
01:25:12,766 --> 01:25:15,869
We want stay here for few more days
and you want us to leave now.

874
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,402
My friends are embarrassed
with your presence.

875
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:20,265
He pushed it on us.

876
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:26,170
My son, please don't remove this amulet
under any circumstances.

877
01:25:26,733 --> 01:25:28,701
Be careful, son.
- Okay, mom.

878
01:25:29,299 --> 01:25:31,434
Bye, be careful Sonu.
- Bye, son.

879
01:26:25,566 --> 01:26:28,902
Why are you dull?
- Nothing.

880
01:26:29,799 --> 01:26:33,068
Didn't your family like me?
- They love you.

881
01:26:34,499 --> 01:26:36,601
My father liked your family so much.

882
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:38,500
Except you.

883
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:50,568
Buddy, earlier few pegs would
keep me calm all the night,

884
01:26:50,733 --> 01:26:54,069
but now l'm having full bottle
but no use.

885
01:26:56,466 --> 01:26:58,401
People are busy with their work except me.

886
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:06,437
What happened?
- Nothing...nothing...

887
01:27:06,566 --> 01:27:09,635
Nobody would believe if l say,
cary on with your game.

888
01:27:10,432 --> 01:27:11,266
You have your drink.

889
01:27:12,532 --> 01:27:14,934
lt's my damn fate,
l'm seeing all those things.

890
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:22,403
Hello my black gold! How could you
sleep peacefully amidst all this tension?

891
01:27:22,532 --> 01:27:27,503
l know the snake will not bite me
because l've applied odomos cream.

892
01:27:27,699 --> 01:27:30,568
Odomos cream? Is it mosquito?

893
01:27:30,733 --> 01:27:32,768
Switch off the light and sleep.

894
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:40,067
Get up from bed!

895
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:17,702
ls it the same snake that ferociously
attacked you, Karthik?

896
01:28:17,799 --> 01:28:18,599
l'm sure, sir.

897
01:28:18,766 --> 01:28:20,601
Even it's mother wouldn't have
seen it so closely.

898
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:25,067
But it's just an ordinay reptile.

899
01:28:26,566 --> 01:28:28,100
Please come in for a minute.

900
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:33,401
ls the snake seeking vengeance on Karthik?

901
01:29:33,933 --> 01:29:35,834
Do you also believe such things, Valli?

902
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,370
After seeing all this l'm unable
to think anything beyond this.

903
01:29:39,532 --> 01:29:42,668
l thought such things happen only in films,
does it happen in real life too?

904
01:29:42,899 --> 01:29:44,967
Didn't l tell you?
Nobody believed me then.

905
01:29:45,132 --> 01:29:46,132
l told about disposing the book...

906
01:29:46,299 --> 01:29:50,636
Give me one day's time,
l'll find a solution to this.

907
01:29:58,332 --> 01:30:05,739
lt's blindfold to the moonlight
of full moon day...

908
01:30:05,866 --> 01:30:13,139
Who dared to put off the light
without being seen?

909
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:23,668
Please listen to me calmly
without getting excited.

910
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:29,971
Karthik, the snake came to kill you.

911
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:33,267
You're its target.

912
01:30:34,265 --> 01:30:36,100
lt won't die without killing you.

913
01:30:36,232 --> 01:30:41,670
But an unexpected matter here is,
someone has hypnotised the snake!

914
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:49,604
lt's new matter but it is not magic
or tantra, pure science!

915
01:30:50,165 --> 01:30:52,233
How can a snake be hypnotised?

916
01:30:55,265 --> 01:30:57,567
We can hypnotise evey living creature.

917
01:30:58,165 --> 01:31:01,668
Unlike for we humans,
there's a different process for animals.

918
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:04,502
lt is called as animal magnetism
or animal therapy.

919
01:31:05,265 --> 01:31:10,069
BBC did a program on it recently,
this is video of that program.

920
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:16,202
Using touch therapy,
they bring the animals into a trance,

921
01:31:16,332 --> 01:31:22,104
once it is in trance, it follows only the
voice of the man who hypnotised it.

922
01:31:22,299 --> 01:31:24,067
ls it possible practically, sir?

923
01:31:24,265 --> 01:31:26,734
This is not rocket science
or alien UFO,

924
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,868
what we see in our eveyday life,

925
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:35,503
to tell you simply,
to make an elephant get into the lory,

926
01:31:35,766 --> 01:31:39,302
you need ten people, a crane
and one full day!

927
01:31:39,866 --> 01:31:44,170
But the same elephant balances
on the top of a small drum in circus.

928
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,132
How?

929
01:31:45,599 --> 01:31:51,504
Trainer takes the animal into trance and
makes it do what it doesn't know.

930
01:31:51,766 --> 01:31:54,802
Generally birds and dogs are
vey scared of fire.

931
01:31:54,966 --> 01:31:59,670
But in circus they pass through
rings of fire.

932
01:32:00,733 --> 01:32:07,840
Cocks are not enemies of cocks but
in cock fights they fight till other one dies.

933
01:32:08,032 --> 01:32:13,237
Because the trainer caresses it
before the fight.

934
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:15,534
lt's known as touch therapy
or hypno therapy.

935
01:32:16,332 --> 01:32:22,604
Likewise someone has hypnotised
the snake to attack with your smell.

936
01:32:23,065 --> 01:32:26,968
That's why it'll ty to kill you till it dies.

937
01:32:35,799 --> 01:32:38,501
But now we must know who he is
and why he's doing this!

938
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,901
To know this we must do reverse engineering.

939
01:32:47,032 --> 01:32:49,167
ls your father in town, Valli?

940
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:54,601
Please don't stop me from talking
about that temple, sir.

941
01:32:54,899 --> 01:32:56,800
lf l know about the histoy of
the temple,

942
01:32:56,966 --> 01:32:59,301
we can easily know what has happened
and what's going to happen!

943
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:07,135
To know full details about this temple,

944
01:33:07,966 --> 01:33:11,302
we must meet the head of
Nagashakthi Peetam in Thanjavur.

945
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,602
Sir, we need to meet the head of mutt.

946
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:27,601
Please arrange to meet him, sir.

947
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:39,639
During the rule of Kirthivarma
Dravida state faced famine,

948
01:34:41,099 --> 01:34:48,706
green fields and cattle vanished
to turn land into a burial ground,

949
01:34:50,099 --> 01:34:55,537
people of Rashtrakoota started to die in
tens and hundreds due to hunger and poverty,

950
01:34:56,165 --> 01:35:00,702
when the rulers were struggling to
take control of the situation,

951
01:35:01,165 --> 01:35:09,306
King saw an idol of Lord Subramanya
while travelling alone,

952
01:35:09,866 --> 01:35:21,344
he made a vow to build a temple if God
saves his county and its people from famine.

953
01:35:22,065 --> 01:35:27,804
Suddenly a drop of rain fell and
it started to pour down,

954
01:35:27,966 --> 01:35:33,171
county came alive green with life
and prosperity.

955
01:35:33,499 --> 01:35:37,302
People were back to their
regular happy peaceful life.

956
01:35:37,499 --> 01:35:49,878
King invited renowned sculptor Viswakarma
and started building the temple.

957
01:35:50,032 --> 01:35:52,901
As the construction work was in progress,

958
01:35:53,232 --> 01:35:55,500
one day King made a request to Viswakarma,

959
01:35:55,666 --> 01:36:00,370
temple dedicated to Lord who
restored life to his kingdom,

960
01:36:00,532 --> 01:36:05,503
must have something special
which no temple had till now!

961
01:36:05,766 --> 01:36:10,937
Asking if his family owned Emerald
would be of any help,

962
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,701
he handed over the emerald to Viswakarma.

963
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:19,904
Viswakarma tested it and decided
to place it under Lord's feet.

964
01:36:20,299 --> 01:36:24,069
When moonlight falls on the emerald
at Lord's feet,

965
01:36:24,165 --> 01:36:28,936
he placed it in such a way that light
is reflected hundreds of times.

966
01:36:29,499 --> 01:36:35,838
Viswakarma built the temple so that moonlight falls
on emerald on Karthika full moon day.

967
01:36:36,566 --> 01:36:45,374
So on the full moon day of Karthika month moonlight
falls on emerald and gives a big flash of light.

968
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:52,205
To make this temple special,

969
01:36:52,366 --> 01:36:59,906
King and Viswakarma kept this emerald
matter secret from all others.

970
01:37:00,499 --> 01:37:02,234
This is fact.

971
01:37:03,632 --> 01:37:06,534
Tomorrow is Karthika month full moon day.

972
01:37:06,766 --> 01:37:08,300
What's the remedy for this, Swamy?

973
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:11,700
May God bless you victoy.

974
01:37:17,132 --> 01:37:18,266
Thanjavur photos?

975
01:37:20,099 --> 01:37:23,902
Did you upload camp photos
Evey day without fail?

976
01:37:24,065 --> 01:37:25,166
l did.

977
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:27,900
Do you've the photos of the
day electrician died?

978
01:37:28,065 --> 01:37:28,698
l do have.

979
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,167
What was the date he died?

980
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:37,434
l think lth.
- Show photos taken on that day.

981
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:41,199
What's it, Karthik?

982
01:37:42,532 --> 01:37:44,433
Anything else other than these.

983
01:37:44,966 --> 01:37:47,268
Go...go...stop...stop...

984
01:37:53,833 --> 01:37:54,700
Come back.

985
01:38:02,899 --> 01:38:04,133
Hey amulet!

986
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:09,733
Stop!

987
01:39:10,065 --> 01:39:12,333
Come with me silently.

988
01:39:30,299 --> 01:39:33,669
What happened to him?
- He's dead.

989
01:39:38,366 --> 01:39:39,266
What shall we do now?

990
01:39:41,232 --> 01:39:45,502
Ty... ty and ty till you succeed.

991
01:39:47,032 --> 01:39:48,433
l'm entering the temple.

992
01:39:49,132 --> 01:39:49,899
Entering temple?

993
01:39:55,099 --> 01:39:56,200
l'm going alone.

994
01:40:13,432 --> 01:40:19,905
What's the truth hidden behind this?

995
01:40:21,032 --> 01:40:25,469
A disturbance that made him sleepless...
- God bless you!

996
01:40:28,699 --> 01:40:34,404
Fate is calling you to do your duty...

997
01:40:36,299 --> 01:40:40,503
ln the temple of God...

998
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,504
Where the answers are hidden?

999
01:40:52,699 --> 01:40:57,303
What's this that is making his restless?

1000
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:48,601
Who is it? Who is it?

1001
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:38,134
How many people are here?

1002
01:43:39,599 --> 01:43:41,033
Who are you guys?

1003
01:44:12,632 --> 01:44:15,401
lt's me...yes, it's me!

1004
01:44:16,265 --> 01:44:21,336
My one year's toil...
one year's hard work!

1005
01:44:21,532 --> 01:44:23,600
You ruined it with just one lantern.

1006
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:24,666
Why did you do it?

1007
01:44:25,065 --> 01:44:26,065
How are you connected to this?

1008
01:44:27,165 --> 01:44:30,167
You want to become a hero
to the people overnight?

1009
01:44:30,332 --> 01:44:31,599
Want to become a hero...

1010
01:45:14,499 --> 01:45:18,803
lt's already too late, tell me now!

1011
01:45:19,432 --> 01:45:23,969
When evey year the light is emitted,
not just local people,

1012
01:45:24,165 --> 01:45:28,435
it has attracted foreigners too,

1013
01:45:29,399 --> 01:45:33,903
last year a group of foreigners visited
and took photos when light is emitted,

1014
01:45:34,833 --> 01:45:38,269
they mailed it to my office in Hyderabad,

1015
01:45:41,432 --> 01:45:44,902
reading their mail, l told them to
meet me personally in my office.

1016
01:45:58,032 --> 01:45:59,166
My people will not agree.

1017
01:45:59,933 --> 01:46:01,668
They'll go on rampage and
Iynch you to death.

1018
01:46:02,599 --> 01:46:03,733
Their faith is so strong.

1019
01:46:04,466 --> 01:46:08,670
lt's better to steal it than tying
to solve the mystey.

1020
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:13,601
We must use the same faith as decoy.

1021
01:46:18,299 --> 01:46:19,099
Trust me.

1022
01:46:19,699 --> 01:46:23,702
We must wait till next year to know
about the light emission.

1023
01:46:24,265 --> 01:46:26,900
lf there are people when the light
is emitted.

1024
01:46:27,265 --> 01:46:28,499
We may not have a one percent
chance also.

1025
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:31,568
So, step one in our plan is...

1026
01:46:32,899 --> 01:46:34,066
...temple must be shut down!

1027
01:46:35,399 --> 01:46:40,170
To shut it down, we need at least
two people who could be bought.

1028
01:46:41,632 --> 01:46:47,004
As the start of bad omen, Amulet man
gave a shot of poison to the trustee.

1029
01:46:49,499 --> 01:46:51,701
Even after this incident l knew people
would visit the temple.

1030
01:46:53,065 --> 01:46:54,599
So, spread fear among people.

1031
01:46:55,566 --> 01:46:57,167
And that fear must be God.

1032
01:46:58,032 --> 01:47:01,668
lf evey person who enters the temple
bravely is bitten by a snake,

1033
01:47:02,065 --> 01:47:03,699
fear psychosis will rule the people,

1034
01:47:04,566 --> 01:47:07,902
but amulet can't inject poison to
evey devotee visiting temple, right?

1035
01:47:08,499 --> 01:47:09,600
l asked him, how?

1036
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:16,933
He told me about a new thing.

1037
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,069
l was surprized to see science
helping destruction.

1038
01:47:22,766 --> 01:47:23,867
l trusted him.

1039
01:47:24,899 --> 01:47:26,734
Two days after the plan,

1040
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,368
we killed a couple,

1041
01:47:30,799 --> 01:47:35,103
we created a scene of strange sounds
emanating from the temple,

1042
01:47:38,332 --> 01:47:39,666
we murdered the chief priest
and got the temple shut,

1043
01:47:42,165 --> 01:47:48,170
From Hyderabad l and my people here kept
recce on people tying to know about temple.

1044
01:47:48,933 --> 01:47:50,134
ln that process,

1045
01:47:51,265 --> 01:47:56,837
ajournalist, ED employee and
investigation officer died.

1046
01:47:57,866 --> 01:48:01,169
You linked God and science vey well.

1047
01:48:02,132 --> 01:48:06,269
Concept is vey good, sir.
Your uncles are on the way.

1048
01:48:06,632 --> 01:48:07,899
Police!

1049
01:48:22,366 --> 01:48:24,501
At last the temple is reopened.
Are you happy now?

1050
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:26,167
Evemhing is God's wish.

1051
01:48:27,466 --> 01:48:29,301
Have you given entire credit to God?

1052
01:48:29,499 --> 01:48:31,267
lsn't it wrong?
- Wrong?

1053
01:48:31,566 --> 01:48:32,500
What else then?

1054
01:48:33,065 --> 01:48:34,900
Temple was shut down by a man,

1055
01:48:35,165 --> 01:48:36,299
because of his selfishness,

1056
01:48:37,165 --> 01:48:38,900
temple was opened again because
of another man,

1057
01:48:39,132 --> 01:48:40,266
because of my curiosity,

1058
01:48:40,699 --> 01:48:42,901
where does God come here, sir?

1059
01:48:43,232 --> 01:48:46,668
You believe nature has answer
to evey question, right?

1060
01:48:47,165 --> 01:48:51,435
Okay, tell me answers to my 3 questions.
-Go ahead.

1061
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:53,501
When you entered this place,

1062
01:48:53,833 --> 01:48:58,604
why did the mad Sadhu told
only you can enter the town,

1063
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:06,672
the hypnotised snake killed eveyone
but couldn't touch you, why?

1064
01:49:07,599 --> 01:49:10,001
ls it because of the amulet your
mother tied on your hand?

1065
01:49:13,099 --> 01:49:17,903
Why did Head of Mutt in Thanjavur
called on you among all of us?

1066
01:49:19,699 --> 01:49:26,906
He told that a man belonging to Aries
will offer the first prayer.

1067
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,302
You know to which zodiac sign
you belong, right?

1068
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:37,004
lf you answer my questions,
l'll accept there's no God and only man!

1069
01:49:37,366 --> 01:49:40,569
Till then, God's wish!

1070
01:49:58,966 --> 01:50:02,169
My age is not enough to solve the
question of whether God exists or not.

1071
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:05,068
But with my experience,

1072
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:09,402
there's a result for evey prayer,
evey prayer has power!

1073
01:50:26,833 --> 01:50:29,669
Karthikeya Kumaraswamy is my full name.

1074
01:50:30,733 --> 01:50:34,103
Subramanya Swamy is another
name of Kumaraswamy.

1075
01:50:37,132 --> 01:50:38,399
lt means God...

1076
01:50:54,032 --> 01:50:55,967
Evemhing is possible with efforts!

1077
01:50:59,099 --> 01:51:00,800
Do you think entire credit of opening
the temple goes to you?

1078
01:51:00,966 --> 01:51:02,100
lsn't it?

1079
01:51:02,299 --> 01:51:04,868
Have you forgotten it?
l came before when you left that night.

1080
01:51:20,599 --> 01:51:21,199
What happened?

1081
01:51:21,399 --> 01:51:23,501
ED officer and his man died in jail.

1082
01:51:24,332 --> 01:51:25,266
With snake bite.

1083
01:51:27,332 --> 01:51:29,267
Mother, so much ghee?

1084
01:51:30,299 --> 01:51:33,135
Haven't you yet removed
that amulet, Karthik?

1085
01:51:38,099 --> 01:51:38,933
Yes, Professor.

1086
01:51:40,499 --> 01:51:43,401
lt seems they have de-hypnotised
the snake, you're safe now.

1087
01:51:45,499 --> 01:51:49,502
But where are we going? It's thrilling
to go to a uncertain destination.

1088
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:51,267
We're going to Goa.
- Goa?

1089
01:51:53,265 --> 01:51:54,866
Why? Bachelor's party?

1090
01:51:55,032 --> 01:51:58,034
Babes are there, right?
It seems there's cave in Goa.

1091
01:51:58,165 --> 01:52:00,700
lt seems non one has ever returned
from the cave.

1092
01:52:01,332 --> 01:52:03,734
We're entering that cave now!
