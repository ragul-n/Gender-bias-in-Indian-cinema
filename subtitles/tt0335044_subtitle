1
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:04,501
"Sweating? Inside a Mercedes?
Son, if the company gets the wind..."

2
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:09,239
"they'll sue us for defamation.
- Not this, I need courage"

3
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:16,172
Relax. Calm down. Courage isn't
a shot that I can administer

4
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,048
Just give it your best shot

5
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:38,460
"What's on your mind, brother?
- I'm apprehensive of losing"

6
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,797
Yet I have a desire to achieve. For
the first time I'm feeling so awkward

7
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,344
"Aren't the lights turned on yet?
- C'mon, hurry up"

8
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,520
"Sorry buddy,
I need it more than you"

9
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:13,701
What are you doing here? I told Dad
I don't want any kind of cheating...

10
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,405
no bribes. I want to win
this competition on my own talent

11
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,377
"Apart from working for your dad,
I can also sing a bit"

12
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,752
"Well, you sing too well..."

13
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,856
"You can sing, too?
- Yes"

14
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,584
You mean... you're participating too?
- Yes

15
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,075
"Especially, before singing"

16
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:56,509
"Krish, my friend, tell me that you're
here to buck me up and not to contest"

17
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,055
Competitions don't interest me

18
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,618
"But tonight I'm taking on myself,
my circumstances"

19
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,835
You guys are fully prepared
to kill me a bachelor

20
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,454
It is said Tansen's music
could light up lamps...

21
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,782
and force the clouds to shower

22
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:47,788
Tonight we expect such a miracle.
Where there is dearth of talents...

23
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:53,264
"and opportunities,
such competitions are a necessity"

24
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,798
I wish all the best to all
our contestants

25
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,904
"Where the last one ended,
this story began..."

26
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:29,296
and will continue.
Everything seems like a dream...

27
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,079
as if it happened only yesterday

28
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,582
"Oh come on, uncle Dharam.
- Morning is gone, dear"

29
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:52,121
It's 12 now.
- Morning for me. I slept at 3

30
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,401
I used to wake your daddy up
just the way I wake you up

31
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,933
Only after he married was I relieved
of this responsibility

32
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:07,978
But... after your mother passed away
your daddy never slept peacefully

33
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:16,115
Okay! Why does Dad want to see me?
- How come you figured he sent me?

34
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:23,590
Every time Dad wants to argue with me
you make me emotional. Now what is it?

35
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,522
Your happy birthday

36
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:34,303
You forgot today? It's your birthday
and your mother's death anniversary

37
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,506
My birthday begins on a sad note.
Sometimes I regret being born

38
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:47,046
"Shut up. Relax. Take a chill, man!
Moron"

39
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:52,581
But I'm excited about your birthday.
- Where is Dad?

40
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,480
"Uncle Dharam said...
- Son, I give you special gifts..."

41
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,149
on your birthdays.
What do you want this year?

42
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,487
"As a baby when I could not even walk,
you gave me everything"

43
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:31,561
I fall short of nothing today.
- The end of desires before youth...

44
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:39,564
is a sign of reckless upbringing.
Now I know what I must present you

45
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,966
"Africa. You know, we have goldmines
in Transvaal"

46
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:54,778
It's a beautiful place.
Far and wide stretches only nature

47
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,022
"No tv, no discotheque, no girls"

48
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,289
Only wild animals and the fragrance
of the goldmines

49
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,596
Only you and solitude.
One moment...

50
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:16,407
I'm sending you to the goldmines
as a supervisor

51
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,680
"Why are you punishing me, Dad?
- What do you mean? I tried my best"

52
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,850
"As it is, you don't do any work here.
- Work?"

53
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,225
Yes

54
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:38,486
"Even if we were to sit doing nothing,
we'll earn 20 million as interest..."

55
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,068
"everyday, from your 6 billion"

56
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,178
Who told you to earn so much
that I don't need to work at all?

57
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,939
"Along with brains, you need guts
to shoulder responsibilities"

58
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,273
Every other call you receive
is from a girl

59
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,446
And six out of your ten girlfriends
try to hook me

60
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,357
For your drop-dead looks
and Michael Douglas' style...

61
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,721
"Son, here's your ticket"

62
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,203
Either you'll join office tomorrow
or you'll be seen in Africa

63
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,032
"I never thought twice before I staked
my life for the sake of my goal"

64
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:27,411
"So son, how does it feel going to
the office for the first time?"

65
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,609
As if going to school
for the first time

66
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:35,010
"Relax, and enjoy my song"

67
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,819
What the hell...?
- Why is it stopping?

68
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:53,834
By God! This car worth 5 million
is driving us to shame

69
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,908
Those tractors back home were better.
- It too doesn't want to go to office

70
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,783
See?

71
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,284
"Look, Shah Rukh Khan!
- No, I'm Hritik"

72
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,995
Get off! Don't touch!

73
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,189
Don't touch my car. Lay off!

74
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,198
The car's stalled right in the middle
of the road...

75
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:31,370
"these naked urchins are having a ball,
and you too? You're no different then"

76
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,904
What sets people apart
is a barrier

77
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,314
"
nstead of laughing over them,
it'd be better if ask them to heave"

78
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,818
No way! They won't touch my car!

79
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,623
Heave! Harder

80
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,385
Careful!
- Heave harder

81
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,870
"Listen to me, son"

82
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,646
"Easy with my car.
- Battle your destiny, while..."

83
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:23,518
I go and make a wish of mine done.
- What are you up to now?

84
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,992
"See the train? I've read, heard and
seen it, but never travelled in one"

85
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:37,134
Relax. Don't be foolish. You've never
stepped into a railway station

86
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,976
"There's always a first time. I pay my
taxes, so doesn't trains belong to me?"

87
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:48,609
Repair your car while I make my life.
- Listen to me... Hritik!

88
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,858
My car

89
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,556
STOP! My car!

90
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,778
What...? What are you doing?

91
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,177
"O'beautifu
 one
with those long tresses..."

92
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,782
who does your deadly eyes seek?

93
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,592
What makes you wander everywhere?

94
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,001
I'm looking for someone...

95
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,199
someone crazy...

96
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,808
"who has set me afire
and vanished"

97
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,241
He's the firefly I'm looking for

98
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,452
My eyes are hot

99
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:41,291
My cool breaths will help

100
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,853
"Try me, later"

101
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,392
"I'm love,
mine is a sojourn"

102
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:55,066
"I'm no less,
I'm the flitting shadow"

103
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,976
"And at nights,
I cast a magic spell"

104
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,810
"O'beautifu
 one
with those long tresses..."

105
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,617
who does your deadly eyes seek?

106
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,825
What makes you flit about?

107
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,949
"Hearts and romance,
the most maligned of all"

108
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,323
What's love without a scandal?

109
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,159
Drop-dead looks... killing me

110
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,829
"Such grace! By God, wonderful"

111
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,759
I'm a flitting shadow...

112
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,266
"at nights,
I cast a magic spell"

113
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,285
"O'beautifu
 one
with those long tresses..."

114
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,788
who does your deadly eyes seek?

115
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,267
What makes you flit about?

116
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,938
I'm looking for someone...

117
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,311
someone crazy...

118
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,813
"who has set my heart afire
and vanished"

119
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,819
He's a firefly

120
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,707
She's gone

121
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,082
Gone

122
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,681
"I had heard that people "fall in love"
"but this is the first time I see it"

123
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,412
What's her name?
- name...?

124
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,009
I'll try to catch up with her
at the next station

125
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,796
Where is the exit? There?

126
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:19,037
Idiot! Are you blind?
Dropped my guitar!

127
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,420
"Forgive him. He's not in his senses.
He's in love, for the first time"

128
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,690
What...? Love?
- Yes. All the lazy chap has seen...

129
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:41,230
is her face. Doesn't know her name.
- Why must you plead for him?

130
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:46,767
"Raksha, remember? I got to know your
name so many days after our meeting"

131
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,441
"This is a railway station, not
Lover's Point. Everyone's watching"

132
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,637
Are you sure no one saw us
at Lover's Point?

133
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:05,624
"If we're late to work on the first clay,
we won't even have money to buy peanuts"

134
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,721
So late? How come?

135
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,656
Why did you have to come?
- Pardon...?

136
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:15,192
I got an ailment. Punctuality.
In my restaurant...

137
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:20,095
"music starts before soup.
- Sir, trust me. Once they hear us..."

138
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,531
they're going to order
another round of soup

139
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,112
What...?
- One more round of soup

140
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:58,839
"Someone's love haunts me
all clay all night"

141
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:06,510
"But I can't tell you
who she is"

142
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,155
Oh God

143
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,036
All night all day...

144
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:31,801
"Someone's love haunts me
all clay all night"

145
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:39,975
"But I can't tell you
who he is"

146
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,815
Oh God

147
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:22,653
I think I'll meet her someday...

148
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:29,893
and pour out my feelings to her...

149
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:38,807
and ask her to decide my fate

150
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:47,142
No matter if she spurns me

151
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:54,821
"All I know is that
I'm crazy about her"

152
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:03,824
I don't care for myself anymore

153
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:12,537
"Someone's love haunts me
all clay all night"

154
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:20,174
"But I can't tell you
who she is"

155
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,518
Oh God

156
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:19,840
The crazy one you love...

157
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:27,843
"she's in love
with you too, sweetheart"

158
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:35,782
"Her stare is a sign
of love"

159
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:43,797
"Her blush is a sign
of willingness"

160
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:52,806
She has kept away from everyone...

161
00:23:53,799 --> 00:24:01,411
"your name, sweetheart"

162
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:09,817
"Someone's love haunts me
all clay all night"

163
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:17,160
"But I can't tell you
who he is"

164
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,827
Oh God

165
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,217
Who's she?
- Raksha

166
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,024
I'd like to meet her

167
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,033
You sing very well

168
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,329
Can you see me tomorrow at my office?

169
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,239
"I came to this city just yesterday.
So, lots to do"

170
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,614
So tomorrow at my office at ten?

171
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:14,688
Know what that means?
- Doesn't mean the end of my contract

172
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,491
"Sing here, and you'll find
many giving you cards like this"

173
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,928
"That's fine, but let's see
where this card takes us to"

174
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,248
Can you tell me where block E is?

175
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,025
I'm new here

176
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,598
"Where were you, brother?
- Has our stuff reached?"

177
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,835
"Yes, but I can't find our flat,
I've been looking"

178
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,931
Strange city. Buildings disappear.
- Manners as well

179
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,146
Hey brother! Here's your car.
Ready to break the speed limit?

180
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,993
Sorry for using your
wheel-chair brother. Let's go

181
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,583
Easy

182
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,358
It was your responsibility
to see that Hritik goes to office

183
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,660
But he never turned up even once.
Where is he?

184
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:05,131
"Relax, Gattu.
- Not Gattu, please!"

185
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:11,533
"Can't you call me Gautam? Uncle, I...
- I know, you're grown up now. Moron!"

186
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:17,811
Hot news. Hritik is in love.
- Love...?

187
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,386
"The fool says he wants to romance.
As for work, you've got it all set"

188
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:30,316
"He's in love? With whom?
- Relax. With a girl, of course"

189
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:36,458
"On his birthday, he lost his heart
in a local train"

190
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,926
What does Gautam Mitta
's son
got to do with local trains?

191
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,697
"Listen to me, please!
- Sure"

192
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,199
"This is the first time it happened.
- But it has happened, isn't it?"

193
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,169
But I did not travel
without a ticket on purpose.

194
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:54,175
I forgot February has 28 days.
- Date of birth: 28 February 1981

195
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,409
So?
- Travelling without a ticket...

196
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,713
Travelling without a ticket means
she's destined to travel by car

197
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:04,584
"We've got such fine cars, Sandra.
Why did you have to travel by train?"

198
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,721
Mustn't give opportunities to strange
people to put awkward questions

199
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:12,591
"But you never heed me, Sandra darling.
- Sandra...? Who?"

200
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,194
Look Mr Sandra...
- Yes Mr Singh?

201
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:23,064
"What do you sell? Spare her.
What will it cost me, tell me?"

202
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:30,810
A ticket? Season ticket? Train?
Platform? Station? Indian Railway?

203
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,827
500 bucks.
Penalty for travelling without ticket

204
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,812
"500, penalty.
Another 500 for sparing her"

205
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,062
You'll get your 500.
I hate debts

206
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:55,294
If you care to give me your address
I'll reach home your money tomorrow

207
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,705
Who has seen tomorrow?
If you allow me to drop you home...

208
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,401
you can return my money today itself

209
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:09,008
"Not that I need the money, but I guess
debts gives you sleepless nights"

210
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,512
"Right, Sandra?
- Wrong. I'm Jojo, not Sandra"

211
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,850
Jojo? Found just what I prayed for

212
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,163
"Jump in.
- Your car, is it?"

213
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,732
Yes. Don't like it? I have ten more.
I'll get another tomorrow

214
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,565
"Cars don't amuse me, anyway"

215
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:55,059
"I've forayed into the narrow lane,
but I don't think I can escape"

216
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,840
Nor can you

217
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:24,523
Who's Jojo's company?
- A boy. For the first time

218
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:29,525
Thank God. She's normal.
- Like his car he must be a big fraud

219
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:44,226
Why are you walking with me?
- Too bad to walk ahead and behind

220
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,016
Must be your family? It is

221
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,687
Very nice.
- Very nice indeed

222
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:58,282
"Stay here, I'll get the money.
- Excuse me"

223
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,629
Are you really returning my money?
- What do you mean?

224
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,004
"I mean, when do we meet next?"

225
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:09,628
The next time you
travel in ladies' compartment

226
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,553
Nice.
- What?

227
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,057
The car. Nice.
- And the boy too

228
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:35,592
"Yeah. Very cute, no?
- What is apparent isn't always true"

229
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,677
Gone.
- Who?

230
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,612
The car.
- Good it's gone

231
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,188
Save your daughter.
- From?

232
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,773
Rachna...

233
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,148
Yes?

234
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,092
Haven't I told you
not to keep that picture out?

235
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,825
Sister-in-law's death
doesn't mean that we've forgotten her

236
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:48,000
We quit Pune. But how long can
our present run away from the past?

237
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,740
"This monsoon,
I'm scared..."

238
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,452
"of the raindrops
falling on my body"

239
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:43,792
It's setting my heart on fire

240
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,195
"This monsoon,
I'm scared..."

241
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,991
"of the raindrops
falling on my body"

242
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:59,406
It's setting my heart on fire

243
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,067
Give life another opportunity

244
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,866
"No better opportunity than this.
- I told you, I'm not going solo"

245
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,165
"Why not?
- Krish, not just man and wife..."

246
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,772
we're also a team.
I'm not singing without you

247
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,411
"D'you know much tomatoes cost?
- Worried about tomatoes, really?"

248
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,982
"I know we love each other clearly.
But, after years we've got..."

249
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:47,420
a chance to record a song. It'll be
absolutely foolish to lose it

250
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:51,459
"Where's the knife?
- In hell! Raksha, listen to me"

251
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,993
It was right here.
- Think about the song you've to sing

252
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:58,664
"You never keep things in place.
- Come, let's rehearse the song"

253
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:03,146
"Want to kill me? Go on, kill me.
But please record your song"

254
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,470
"Believe me, nothing else matters more"

255
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:13,910
"Okay, one. Only one.
- One is enough"

256
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:41,542
I wouldn't know nights of torment

257
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:49,779
"For, when I take your name,
a thousand lamps are lit"

258
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:55,787
How would I know what torment is?

259
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:08,133
I too used to sing. But now
I only hear... intently though

260
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,808
"And I can tell you, not just your wife
she's going to become a big star"

261
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,967
"Superb, Gaurav. Enough for now"

262
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,404
How come the door's open...?

263
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,410
I'm sorry... you?

264
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,057
Your new neighbours

265
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,354
"Nowadays, Gaurav plays the violin
only when he's happy"

266
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,857
Gaurav's really good at
playing the violin

267
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,485
If he wishes...
- If he wishes...?

268
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,993
"What Gaurav wants,
maybe even he doesn't know"

269
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:51,239
"Actually, he wants nothing.
He's alive only because..."

270
00:38:52,997 --> 00:39:00,108
only because I'm not letting him die.
- What went wrong...?

271
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:08,850
You won't believe it.
Liveliness another name for Gaurav

272
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,856
"His jokes, his mischief,
his songs..."

273
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:09,341
"In the window opposite mine,
lives a moonlike beauty"

274
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:16,655
"But alas! She's often
angry with me"

275
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:08,837
"Ever since I have seen her,
I haven't lit a lamp"

276
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,842
"I sit, clutching my heart,
I go nowhere"

277
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:22,849
"Everywhere I see, my eyes
see only her"

278
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:30,587
"In the window opposite mine,
lives a moonlike beauty"

279
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:08,564
It has stopped raining.
The clouds have moved away

280
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:16,002
"But I still thirst for
a glimpse of her"

281
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,712
"When will the thirst of my eyes
be quenched...?"

282
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,841
I keep lamenting all day and night

283
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:29,852
"In the window opposite mine,
lives a moonlike beauty"

284
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,790
"But alas! She's often
angry with me"

285
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,135
"In that accident, Gaurav did
not suffer any physical injury"

286
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,131
But he was convinced...

287
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,398
that he couldn't walk anymore

288
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,800
He... he regrets he's alive

289
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,752
I said so much. We don't even
know each other so well...

290
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,591
Maybe you could talk because
we don't know each other

291
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:15,028
It's easier to take the burden
off your chest with strangers

292
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,265
I can understand Gaurav's feelings.
When love is no longer there...

293
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,234
"in one's life, life does
turn invalid"

294
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,659
Late?

295
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:51,664
"Had I not left without money yesterday,
I wouldn't have had to wait here"

296
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,396
Here's your 450 rupees.
I had set out with 500...

297
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,037
but I had to renew my pass.
The fares have gone up

298
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,673
"if fares keep on increasing like this,
how will people like me travel?"

299
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,542
"In a Mercedes or a BMW.
- Oh yes, very funny!"

300
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:08,738
"You'll wait for me tomorrow, won't you?
I'll pay you the 50 bucks then"

301
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,351
Let's go. St. Agnacious Road.
- Listen...

302
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,255
"Jojo, will you leave a BMW
and travel in a rickshaw?"

303
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,594
Haven't you heard? St Agnacious Road.
Let's go

304
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,072
She appears to have got
everything wrong

305
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,510
Quiet

306
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:45,177
"How am I to know, my love...
what an evening of sorrow is"

307
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,589
A hundred lamps were lit...

308
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:54,393
the moment I uttered your name

309
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,042
You're on TV!
- Let me sleep

310
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,524
Are you mad? Get up and see...
your song's being played on TV!

311
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,765
"Ever since the dot
on my forehead..."

312
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:44,443
have worked like eyes for me...

313
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:52,118
"my eyes are only for you,
my love"

314
00:46:54,444 --> 00:47:01,794
"Ever since you have taken
my hand with love..."

315
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:09,797
"your fingers have
been my bangles, my love"

316
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,869
We were celebrating

317
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:42,766
I'm the only man in the world who's
here to celebrate his own losses

318
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:48,640
We're the ones who will stand to lose
if we let our manager go away

319
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,642
Manager...?
- Yes

320
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,772
"Raksha, this is your new manager.
Mr Chandru Che
aramani"

321
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,022
What...?

322
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:03,305
He waits for me everyday.
And I wonder where he went away today

323
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,160
Was he here...?

324
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,464
That chap in the Mercedes

325
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,067
Did you see him?

326
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,246
What's so funny?

327
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,346
"
'm not late, am I?
- What're you doing in a rickshaw?"

328
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:31,683
You have a problem with my cars.
So I bought an auto-rickshaw

329
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,685
Bought it...?
- Yes

330
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:38,090
I'm not used to renting things you see.
We also own an aircraft in the family

331
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,628
Sol bought this.
Tell you something?

332
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:45,798
To buy a car is very easy.
But an auto-rickshaw...? Damn tough

333
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,852
Which is why I'm late.
- No need to take all the trouble

334
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,874
Your favourite vehicle is here...
how about a cup of coffee then?

335
00:48:55,999 --> 00:49:00,499
"At the Taj, what say?
- Rickshaws are not allowed in that area"

336
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,718
I'll take you to a place where they
serve better coffee than the Taj...

337
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,093
and it's cheaper too

338
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,168
What happened?
- Nothing

339
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,672
ls it very hot?
- Obviously. It's coffee

340
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,659
What is the matter?

341
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,827
"How...?
I mean, where do we begin from?"

342
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:53,890
"You start there, I'll begin here.
We'll meet when we get to the middle"

343
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,633
So why don't we begin
at the middle?

344
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:10,182
"It was a sight. There was coffee on
his shirt, and the dosa in his mouth"

345
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,851
What have I said to make you
hang your face?

346
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,730
"25 years ago, this is exactly how a
boy came to my house and spilt coffee"

347
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,733
"When I saw him behaving like a child,
my heart went out to him"

348
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,669
"if only he hadn't spilt the coffee,
I wouldn't have fallen in love..."

349
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:34,799
and wouldn't suffer a heart-break.
- Aunty...

350
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:39,077
how does everything turn out to
being a bad part of your life?

351
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:43,810
"I mean, I'm enjoying my life.
Why must you be upset?"

352
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,820
"Have all the fun in
your life, my child"

353
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,474
What is the matter?

354
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,986
"What's up, Krish?
You look very happy today"

355
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,724
"Oh yes, for the first time
in our lives..."

356
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:29,063
our bills are lesser
than the cheques we issue

357
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:33,394
You're a star and you're rich!
- Not me. Say us

358
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:39,035
"Sure, but the money's all yours.
I'll do my best to save it"

359
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,913
I'm going to swallow it all

360
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:47,071
"We're happy the way we are,
aren't we?"

361
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:54,078
"In any case, success is like a dream.
A dream that will break anytime"

362
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,393
"With your eyes open, you don't dream.
You see what's for real"

363
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,304
Forget all that and tell me
what you wish to buy first

364
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:12,172
A window from where I can see
the clear skies

365
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,568
That's chapter two.
It'll take me time to find that

366
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,242
Tell me something I can
present immediately

367
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:27,845
"Yes, people have started
recognising me nowadays, you see"

368
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:34,295
"And it's difficult to find an auto.
- Don't blame autos now, okay?"

369
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:40,461
How will a poor auto
keep pace with you?

370
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,045
Yes?

371
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,675
Sign here

372
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,844
What is it?
- A parcel

373
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,846
Where?
- Downstairs

374
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,971
Why didn't you bring it upstairs?
- I can't

375
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,654
You placed an order yesterday.
So it's delivered today

376
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,591
ls this my car...?
- The car belongs to you...

377
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,127
so does the driver

378
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,083
You're driving so fast!
- When life's in the fast lane...

379
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,208
it's a sin to step on the brakes.
Thank you

380
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,497
Where are we headed...?

381
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,694
"This looks like the locality
of the rich, doesn't it?"

382
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:20,105
"Oh yes, you've grown so big,
you can fit only in this place"

383
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,076
"We're going home, sweetheart.
- Home?!"

384
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,800
Chapter two.
- But...

385
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,801
"but this is so big, Krish"

386
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:07,539
What are we going to do with it?
- Live in it

387
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,016
O Swan...

388
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,117
my beautiful Swan...

389
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,014
where dost thou fly away?

390
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:53,193
"With my desires as your wings,
where do you fly away to?"

391
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:58,789
"Keeping its heart under control
amidst the lashing waves..."

392
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:05,523
"I am your companion
in life"

393
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,422
O Swan...

394
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,819
my beautiful Swan...

395
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,492
where dost thou fly away?

396
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:39,891
"With my desires as your wings,
where do you fly away to?"

397
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,921
How much?
- Ten rupees

398
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:48,160
I feel so upset when I see Gaurav.
Like I feel when I see you.

399
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:52,697
The two of you are clinging
to your past so badly...

400
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:56,893
that you can't see your present
slipping out of your hands

401
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,138
"More than my past,
I'm upset about my kid sister"

402
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:04,776
I wonder where my grandmother's soul
has come from to possess her

403
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,848
"She keeps...
- Brother, I'm serious"

404
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,521
About me or Gaurav?

405
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,846
You're angry only with people
you care for

406
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,098
You love him?

407
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,667
I don't know

408
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,938
Whenever Gaurav plays
the violin like this...

409
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,805
it stirs my heart

410
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,089
Not in this city too!

411
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:53,124
Looks like there's a power-failure
in the whole area. You have a candle?

412
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,499
No

413
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,948
Who is it...?
- It's me... Dev

414
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,323
Coming

415
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,417
Come on in.
- I just need a candle

416
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:34,961
The doorway's a bit curved.
I trip even when there's light

417
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:39,797
And now...
- I need a candle

418
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,803
"Wait here, I'll get it"

419
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:06,403
Here you are

420
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,886
What happened?

421
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,378
It brought back old memories

422
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,124
The first time I met Payal...
- Payal?

423
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:36,792
My wife.
- Your wife...?

424
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:44,805
"She's no more. She died last year,
of cancer"

425
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,976
I don't know why bad things
happen to nice people

426
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,998
When Gaurav finds the burden
too much to bear...

427
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,626
this is how I comfort him too

428
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:21,834
"To share someone's pain,
you need to understand it"

429
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,406
"Like you, I'll try to make friends
with pain and darkness"

430
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:38,056
"I don't need this anymore.
- No, keep it"

431
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,059
The power won't tell you
when it's going to fail

432
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:45,963
Maybe I don't want to lose the
chance of coming over unannounced

433
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,807
What is the matter...?
ls everything okay?

434
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,685
This is the first time you're
introducing me to your family

435
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,823
You're meeting my family. So?
- I've never appeared for exams...

436
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,827
after I left school.
I'm a bit nervous

437
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,695
But there's a problem with my family.
- What?

438
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,072
They're much too friendly

439
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,794
So pleased to meet you. So pleased...
- I can see that

440
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,601
My cutie-pie!

441
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,803
Not done to go away
from our doorstep!

442
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:02,802
I told you so. Didn't I Jojo?
- Oh yes

443
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:25,822
Time to open the bar. C'mon!

444
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,904
How can you digest so much of love?
- This is nothing

445
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,072
You ought to worry about
your own digestion

446
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,376
"Because tonight, Mom's going
to stuff you with food..."

447
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:41,646
dad's going to serve liquor and
granny's going to tell you stories

448
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,817
"He was going to be my husband, and
instead of proposing marriage to me..."

449
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,319
"he asked me, Will you
have dinner with me?"

450
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,656
Will you go to the beach with me?
And I was scared...

451
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:56,067
"that if he didn't propose at all,
how would I say "yes"?"

452
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,707
"And then?
- No, don't!"

453
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:07,271
"You were eventually married,
weren't you?"

454
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,407
So grandpa must certainly
have proposed to you

455
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,776
"Proposed, my foot!
I had to make him propose"

456
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,151
"That's enough, Mama"

457
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:24,817
"My son, when one is high on life,
you need to drink more to remain sober"

458
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:53,271
Looks like the young man is friendlier
with your father than you

459
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,464
Mr Krish
- Yes mister?

460
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:13,043
The keys.
- Keys?

461
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:17,803
To your flat. Madam has gone out.
She left the keys for you

462
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,805
Gone out...? At this hour?

463
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,690
"Sorry, darling.
Please don't be angry"

464
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,626
"There was something wrong
in the song we recorded today..."

465
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,029
"and since tomorrow's the
final mixing, I have to go"

466
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,404
I'll return soon

467
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:55,446
"Eat well, darling. I've cooked
everything you like"

468
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:59,048
"Missus, I like nothing
when you're not around"

469
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:14,165
"Because I'm not around to stop you,
don't be silly enough to drink"

470
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,004
"Missus, you're remote-controlling me"

471
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,682
"l won't stop following you
even in your dreams"

472
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:35,021
"I'll dream only when
I go to sleep, won't I?"

473
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:17,864
"if you leave me ever again,
I'm going to blast your studio"

474
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,404
I'll help you do that

475
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:28,206
"Krish, I want to live only
as your wife. Only a wife"

476
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:38,149
We'll have to do something that
makes you a wife and also a star

477
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:48,488
"Uncle Dharam...
- Why're you yelling, Gattu?"

478
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:52,822
Where is Hritik? Tell me.
- He is where he ought to be...

479
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,033
he's in the office! Oh yes.
- Really?

480
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,036
So the young has gone to the office?
On his own?

481
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,573
"I asked him to go.
- Uncle..."

482
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:06,710
I must see this miracle for myself.
If I don't find him in the office...

483
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:10,714
you can start packing his bags.
When I return this evening...

484
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,251
I'll bring his ticket to Africa

485
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:19,656
Hritik! My son!
- Uncle Dharam! Have a heart!

486
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:24,864
Forget about my heart. If you don't
get ready and rush to the office...

487
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:30,668
your heart's going to take the shock of
meandering through the forests of Africa

488
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:34,936
So dad's again threatening me...?
- Your dad's really livid

489
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:40,213
And I lied to him that
you're already at the office

490
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,717
"Has Hritik come to the office?
- I don't know, sir"

491
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:54,817
"Sonny boy, watch your step!"

492
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,070
Has Hritik come to the office?

493
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:08,432
Ass! Don't wash your eyes
with soap-water

494
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:14,712
If I could open my eyes I'd know
what I'm washing my eyes with

495
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:19,551
"Mr Vaswani, have you seen Hritik?
- No, sir. Not Shah Rukh either"

496
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,092
"Uncle, hurry up"

497
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:26,207
How can you go out like that?
- Dad's in a terrible mood

498
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,875
I've looked everywhere in the office
and there's no trace of Hritik

499
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,643
"Where is he, if he
indeed came here?"

500
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,090
Where are you coming from?
- You're the one who's just come in

501
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:02,793
And I've been here all morning.
- Don't lie!

502
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:06,197
"I looked everywhere, you
weren't around. So where were you?"

503
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,327
"Well, I...
- Did you look in the stores?"

504
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:16,707
The stores. You didn't look there?
- What were you doing in the stores?

505
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:20,689
What was I doing there...?
- He was checking the stocks

506
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,407
"What else could he do there?
Not dance, certainly"

507
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,521
"Calm down, Gattu. Gattu, you...
- Uncle! This is my office"

508
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:34,786
I'm not Gattu over here.
- All right. You aren't

509
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,662
"Anyway, where have you been
all these days?"

510
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:42,573
Neither did I get to see you
at home nor at the office

511
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,041
I was busy... I'm still busy

512
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:49,006
D'you know how much of work's lying
pending this office? Ask them...

513
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:52,417
Uncle Dharam... you come with me
and tell me...

514
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:55,051
where's my cabin?

515
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,692
"You...?
- I'm Juan, your secretary"

516
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:11,595
"That bell's meant for me.
- Sorry, here you are"

517
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,826
"I mean, I come when
you ring that bell"

518
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,704
You mean these bells are
for different secretaries?

519
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:24,758
"And each one knows which is which.
- You're right, sir"

520
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:31,583
What are we doing in this office
to need so many secretaries?

521
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:34,652
"Mr Devdarshan Suri can
explain that to you, sir"

522
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:38,656
Mr Devdarshan Suri?
- Yes. The head of your music division

523
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:41,091
Which of these bells
is meant for Mr Suri?

524
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:45,859
"Since his cabin is a bit far,
Mr Mittal steps out shouts for him"

525
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,671
"So you know my name, sir.
- Sure. Stop calling me sir..."

526
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,046
and give me some work to do

527
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,011
"You can listen to this CD, sir.
- What's this?"

528
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,781
"it has been produced
by our company, sir"

529
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:07,685
I think we must get this singer to
sign an exclusive contract with us

530
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,789
Oh yes... Raksha. Everybody's
listening to her songs nowadays

531
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,693
And I didn't even know our company
had produced the album

532
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:19,461
When Jojo gets hear this...
she's a huge fan of hers

533
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,909
Could you arrange a meeting between
Jojo and her at the earliest?

534
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,645
"She'd love to meet her.
- Sure, sir."

535
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,147
I'll organise it right today.
More than Jojo...

536
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,629
Raksha would be happy to meet you

537
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:45,281
I'm no boss. You can call me Hritik

538
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:56,106
What happened?

539
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:01,798
"No, I can't believe it all started
at this restaurant"

540
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,656
"Had Krish been here, he'd have
been happier than I am"

541
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,816
Krish? Who's that?
- My husband

542
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:15,336
Maybe you don't remember.
But we have already met

543
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:19,088
"On the railway platform,
you were..."

544
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,826
"Where is Krish?
- I told you, no"

545
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:31,771
"Once I say no, you must go away.
- Please let me go in"

546
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:35,639
"No, that's not allowed.
- I'm her husband. Let me go in"

547
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:38,742
"Whoever you are, you're not allowed.
- Let him through"

548
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:44,180
"And you folks take his autograph first.
Lucky chap, to have a wife like that"

549
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:49,107
"In your shoes, I too would
have been comfortably in bed"

550
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,656
"There's no need to
work all your life, isn't it?"

551
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,125
That's how a wife ought to be

552
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,609
You don't realise what you've done...

553
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,319
whom you've done it to

554
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:23,817
You can't even imagine
what I can do to you

555
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:32,812
"Excuse me, your husband's involved
in a fight with someone out there"

556
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,769
Your bail has been arranged.
Come on

557
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,422
"Why do you have to take on
the whole world, Krish?"

558
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:06,792
Because I'm your husband.
Only a husband

559
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,649
I'm glad the I.G. turned out
to be my fan

560
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,406
Or a case would've been
registered against you

561
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:21,178
You know what it could've led to?
- What could it have led to? What?

562
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,089
You needn't have used your stardom
to have me released

563
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:28,478
I don't regret what I did

564
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,622
If that I.G.'s son does
a thing like this again...

565
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,284
I'll break his nose all over again

566
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:42,768
He only called you my husband.
And that's the truth

567
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:48,878
Isn't it?

568
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:55,576
"Just that you're my husband.
- Yes, I am"

569
01:17:56,938 --> 01:18:00,367
But not the kind of husband
the world thinks I am

570
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:06,835
"What have we to do with what
the others think, Krish?"

571
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:29,346
See these stars?

572
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,810
"You're a star too, Raksha"

573
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:38,820
And the city seeks your glitter
from you

574
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:43,819
All the time

575
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,428
"Among them,

576
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:39,683
"Rachna, where's Dev?
- What happened?"

577
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:43,551
What is the matter?
- Please help! Dev!

578
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:47,598
"What happened, Gauri?
- Come with me, Dev. Gaurav..."

579
01:20:31,856 --> 01:20:34,200
Nothing can be said as yet

580
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:40,003
We'll have to wait the night
for him to get over the danger

581
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:47,806
We'll have to have courage...
especially you

582
01:20:49,807 --> 01:20:52,057
"Rachna, you can't..."

583
01:20:53,444 --> 01:20:57,373
"Rachna, don't go there. They
won't let you meet Gaurav"

584
01:21:20,905 --> 01:21:25,854
Sometimes I think I've tied him
and life together in ropes...

585
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:29,588
and stopped him from dying

586
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:35,854
Will I let him go away
just like that...?

587
01:21:36,854 --> 01:21:39,130
"For me, he's..."

588
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:43,934
Don't even say something
you don't believe me

589
01:21:47,798 --> 01:21:50,941
What happened tonight
which led Gaurav to...?

590
01:21:52,803 --> 01:21:57,589
"It has nothing to do with tonight, Dev.
It has to do with the date"

591
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:04,558
"Exactly a year ago,
on this very day..."

592
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:07,822
Gaurav met with that accident

593
01:22:28,839 --> 01:22:32,844
"Darling, I'm working late.
Mala's on leave..."

594
01:22:33,277 --> 01:22:36,055
"and I didn't find the time
to prepare dinner"

595
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:40,180
"Please look in the fridge.
You'll surely find something"

596
01:23:27,164 --> 01:23:35,174
"I've nothing to complain about
in life, except you"

597
01:23:45,115 --> 01:23:52,795
"But then life is no life
without you too"

598
01:24:03,801 --> 01:24:09,808
"Except for you,
I've no complaint in life"

599
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:11,804
"How I wish I could cuddle up to you
and cry my eyes out"

600
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:27,285
"But then your eyes are not
wet with tears either"

601
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:37,830
"I've no other complaint in life
except you..."

602
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:55,120
"but life has no meaning
without you, either"

603
01:26:58,409 --> 01:27:06,419
"if you say so, the moon
shall not set tonight..."

604
01:27:07,885 --> 01:27:12,391
ask the night to go on

605
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:20,806
"Between you and me, we have
hardly any time left now"

606
01:27:24,668 --> 01:27:32,610
"I've no other complaint in life
except you"

607
01:27:34,244 --> 01:27:41,560
"Really, no complaint at all"

608
01:27:42,753 --> 01:27:50,570
"For life, without you
has no meaning either"

609
01:27:52,763 --> 01:27:59,772
"it really is meaningless...
Believe me"

610
01:28:01,104 --> 01:28:05,780
"I've no complaint in life...
except for you"

611
01:28:11,215 --> 01:28:13,759
I gave you the cassette of my songs
a month ago

612
01:28:13,884 --> 01:28:18,527
"You said you'd listen to it immediately.
- I'm sorry, I was busy"

613
01:28:18,889 --> 01:28:22,598
"All right, please return
my cassette to me"

614
01:28:24,795 --> 01:28:27,799
"Really? You do put on airs, I say"

615
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:33,978
Dozens of better singers are
struggling to make it in the city

616
01:28:34,805 --> 01:28:37,217
Better singers? How do you know?

617
01:28:37,474 --> 01:28:40,018
You didn't have the time
to listen to my songs

618
01:28:40,143 --> 01:28:41,687
I don't need to either

619
01:28:41,812 --> 01:28:44,690
I've been around for 20 years.
From the way they talk...

620
01:28:44,815 --> 01:28:47,352
I get to know their worth

621
01:28:56,827 --> 01:28:59,077
What brings you here?

622
01:29:00,163 --> 01:29:02,508
I'm trying to earn a living.
- Stop kidding

623
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:06,211
You're Raksha's husband.
You shouldn't be saying such things

624
01:29:06,336 --> 01:29:10,842
"Mr Khanna, being Raksha's husband
isn't employment in itself"

625
01:29:21,919 --> 01:29:26,459
I'd be very happy to record
a song with you

626
01:29:26,857 --> 01:29:30,714
But your experience tells you
that I'm no singer at all

627
01:29:31,194 --> 01:29:33,470
Why must you embarrass me?

628
01:29:33,864 --> 01:29:37,009
"Actually, I didn't know you're
Raksha's husband and

629
01:29:37,134 --> 01:29:39,678
And I didn't know being
Raksha's husband was...

630
01:29:39,803 --> 01:29:43,615
"the qualification of a good singer.
- No, Mr Krish..."

631
01:29:43,874 --> 01:29:46,821
What will you take to go to hell?

632
01:30:32,255 --> 01:30:34,505
Mala...

633
01:30:57,814 --> 01:31:01,159
I'm no good... worthless!

634
01:31:06,823 --> 01:31:10,236
"No, Krish.
You're not a failure"

635
01:31:11,628 --> 01:31:16,077
"Not just the city, this country,
the whole world will..."

636
01:31:16,233 --> 01:31:21,512
acknowledge what a great singer you are.
- When...?

637
01:31:30,847 --> 01:31:33,097
Soon. Very soon

638
01:31:52,803 --> 01:31:57,411
"He's better. He's a bit weak,
but he's out of danger"

639
01:31:58,608 --> 01:32:00,858
You may meet him

640
01:32:14,091 --> 01:32:17,834
I couldn't have spent
the night on my own

641
01:32:19,129 --> 01:32:22,915
"Except sitting down with you,
I've done nothing else"

642
01:32:24,301 --> 01:32:26,551
That was enough

643
01:32:29,406 --> 01:32:34,116
I must tell you...

644
01:32:34,845 --> 01:32:38,383
for the first time today...

645
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:48,595
"you are the one who has
brought love into my life"

646
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:53,297
I must tell you...

647
01:32:54,197 --> 01:32:58,202
for the first time today...

648
01:32:59,803 --> 01:33:07,813
"you are the one who has
brought love into my life"

649
01:33:48,785 --> 01:33:56,795
"There's so much more
I have to tell you"

650
01:33:58,862 --> 01:34:05,802
"But how will I tell you everything
in people's presence?"

651
01:34:08,972 --> 01:34:16,823
"But this much I must
tell you today..."

652
01:34:18,815 --> 01:34:26,825
"you are the one who has
brought love into my life"

653
01:34:58,121 --> 01:35:06,131
"My heart has already
taken you for my own"

654
01:35:07,964 --> 01:35:15,974
"I see a dream
with my eyes open"

655
01:35:17,974 --> 01:35:24,823
"You are putting
your arms around me"

656
01:35:27,817 --> 01:35:34,996
"You are the one who has
brought love into my life"

657
01:35:36,426 --> 01:35:41,774
I must tell you...

658
01:35:42,032 --> 01:35:46,037
for the first time today...

659
01:35:47,637 --> 01:35:55,579
"you are the one who has
brought love into my life"

660
01:35:57,580 --> 01:36:00,789
"Love, love, love"

661
01:36:39,289 --> 01:36:41,565
What are you up to?

662
01:36:42,759 --> 01:36:45,763
I'm running.
Without getting anywhere

663
01:36:58,775 --> 01:37:00,719
"Yes, he's very much here"

664
01:37:00,844 --> 01:37:05,350
"Call for you, Krish.
- Impossible. Nobody calls me"

665
01:37:05,648 --> 01:37:08,505
Must be a wrong number.
- No wrong number

666
01:37:25,802 --> 01:37:29,547
It gives me great pleasure to
welcome a great singer like you

667
01:37:29,672 --> 01:37:32,029
"No, sir. I'm the one
who's happy"

668
01:37:34,878 --> 01:37:39,807
"With a wife like Raksha, it doesn't
take long to realise your dreams"

669
01:37:42,018 --> 01:37:44,963
What do you mean?
- That you're a great singer...

670
01:37:45,088 --> 01:37:50,162
Raksha has told us. Raksha's
already recording a number for us

671
01:37:50,493 --> 01:37:52,939
"You're a good singer, no doubt"

672
01:37:53,763 --> 01:37:57,472
But it'll be amazing when
the two of you sing together

673
01:37:57,867 --> 01:38:00,313
Our company...

674
01:38:05,141 --> 01:38:07,391
May we change it a bit?

675
01:38:22,792 --> 01:38:30,540
Why did you do it?
They wanted you to sing. Not me

676
01:38:31,501 --> 01:38:35,608
I was a bribe they gave you
and you accepted it

677
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:41,041
Every man has to make
a beginning somewhere

678
01:38:41,211 --> 01:38:43,321
He takes help from
someone or the other

679
01:38:43,446 --> 01:38:45,756
I don't want your help!

680
01:38:55,325 --> 01:38:59,171
Why not? Because I'm your wife?

681
01:39:01,097 --> 01:39:04,101
Can't you consider me
to be your friend?

682
01:39:07,837 --> 01:39:10,841
Am I an enemy?

683
01:39:15,512 --> 01:39:20,860
If has to do with your name
and not my talent alone...

684
01:39:21,317 --> 01:39:23,854
you certainly are an enemy

685
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:29,529
If it's your promise that's valued
and not my talent...

686
01:39:29,859 --> 01:39:32,271
you certainly are an enemy

687
01:39:32,529 --> 01:39:37,275
"if my destiny is a slave to your mercy,
you certainly are an enemy"

688
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:42,213
I do not wish to stand on you
to increase my stature

689
01:40:08,231 --> 01:40:11,838
"Among thorns, I stand..."

690
01:40:12,635 --> 01:40:16,640
my eyes eagerly awaiting you...

691
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:23,216
dreaming of Spring

692
01:40:25,848 --> 01:40:29,853
Like sands in a desert...

693
01:40:30,386 --> 01:40:33,856
moonlight...

694
01:40:34,657 --> 01:40:40,972
lights up my face

695
01:40:43,166 --> 01:40:50,812
"How am I to know, my love,
what a dark night of sorrow is?"

696
01:40:51,341 --> 01:40:58,816
"A hundred lamps were lit,
whenever I uttered your name"

697
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:08,232
"How am I to know, my love,
what a dark night of sorrow is?"

698
01:41:08,825 --> 01:41:16,835
"A hundred lamps were lit,
whenever I uttered your name"

699
01:41:36,252 --> 01:41:39,790
"How am I to know, my love..."

700
01:41:54,137 --> 01:41:57,115
"I'm convinced you're going
senile, Uncle Dharam"

701
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:03,589
"if being happy is senility,
I've been senile all my life, son"

702
01:42:04,881 --> 01:42:07,667
What is the matter Gattu?
- Gattu again?

703
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:13,828
"Let's decide this once and for all.
Sit in the car, come on"

704
01:42:17,827 --> 01:42:20,501
My mind works better
in a moving car

705
01:42:20,963 --> 01:42:23,007
You're in the wrong seat

706
01:42:23,132 --> 01:42:25,910
People will think you're taking
your chauffeur for a drive

707
01:42:26,035 --> 01:42:28,606
To hell with...
just sit in the car

708
01:42:28,838 --> 01:42:31,648
"With you, or in the backseat?"

709
01:42:31,908 --> 01:42:34,855
"Cool it... just cool it, Gattu"

710
01:42:41,784 --> 01:42:44,034
Careful!

711
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:45,830
Hritik is a fool

712
01:42:45,955 --> 01:42:48,666
He doesn't understand
the world and women

713
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:50,935
Which is why I had entrusted
him in your care

714
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:55,006
To keep him away from women who
want to trap him for his wealth

715
01:42:55,131 --> 01:42:58,109
And what did you do? You let
him fall in a trap like that...

716
01:42:58,234 --> 01:43:01,613
and just watched the fun.
- Gattu...

717
01:43:01,804 --> 01:43:04,054
No Gattu!

718
01:43:04,807 --> 01:43:08,019
"I keep tabs on everything.
- Watch it, you ass!"

719
01:43:08,144 --> 01:43:11,284
We'll ram into something...
careful! Cool it!

720
01:43:11,814 --> 01:43:16,820
I feel ashamed when I think I'm
the one who taught you to drive

721
01:43:19,155 --> 01:43:22,298
Looks like they've laid
a very elaborate trap

722
01:43:22,825 --> 01:43:27,325
But I will never be able to see
my son go to seed before my eyes

723
01:43:27,497 --> 01:43:29,374
I will not tolerate that

724
01:43:29,499 --> 01:43:32,275
"You're testing my tolerance, dad"

725
01:43:32,835 --> 01:43:36,014
I'm in love with Jojo and you have
no right to say such things about her

726
01:43:36,139 --> 01:43:40,718
"Uncle Dharam, make him see reason.
- Jojo? What kind of name is Jojo?"

727
01:43:40,843 --> 01:43:44,322
We'll call her Jaswinder after
the wedding. Just cool it till then

728
01:43:44,447 --> 01:43:46,991
Wedding...? He hasn't even
lost his milk-teeth...

729
01:43:47,116 --> 01:43:49,227
and he's already obsessed
with marriage!

730
01:43:49,352 --> 01:43:52,852
How do you know this girl
isn't after your wealth?

731
01:43:53,222 --> 01:43:57,669
Can you prove me wrong? If she gets to
know that you don't have a penny...

732
01:43:57,794 --> 01:44:01,469
she'll disappear like...
- Horns from a donkey's head

733
01:44:03,299 --> 01:44:05,802
He's out to fall in love!

734
01:44:07,937 --> 01:44:10,611
Where are you going?

735
01:44:11,808 --> 01:44:15,808
To find out what is right.
My heart? Or is it your brains

736
01:44:16,145 --> 01:44:20,359
Want me to fetch the car or
will you go in an auto-rickshaw?

737
01:44:20,817 --> 01:44:23,627
So what do you want to ask?

738
01:44:23,953 --> 01:44:26,297
Whenever I want to discuss
something with you...

739
01:44:26,422 --> 01:44:30,501
you bring me to this restaurant
where this dosa stands between us!

740
01:44:30,626 --> 01:44:32,870
So what's to blame?
The issue or the dosa?

741
01:44:32,995 --> 01:44:35,245
Neither

742
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:40,042
"Jojo, won't you marry me?"

743
01:44:44,874 --> 01:44:47,124
Say something

744
01:44:50,046 --> 01:44:53,391
I'm thinking of something to say.
- Why think?

745
01:44:53,783 --> 01:44:59,131
Just say that you're marrying me.
- I want to say yes...

746
01:45:01,057 --> 01:45:04,001
but will you be able to afford
marriage with me?

747
01:45:04,126 --> 01:45:07,801
Afford? You must be kidding

748
01:45:08,965 --> 01:45:11,809
I'm one of the richest men
in this country

749
01:45:12,201 --> 01:45:16,206
No... your Papa is one of the
richest men in the country

750
01:45:20,443 --> 01:45:22,887
You haven't earned a penny
on your own

751
01:45:23,012 --> 01:45:28,226
"l mean, will you be able to afford
a wife and kids on your own earnings?"

752
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:33,630
My Papa's wealth belongs to me

753
01:45:34,824 --> 01:45:39,070
"if you wish to marry me, you'll have
to forget about your Papa's wealth"

754
01:45:39,195 --> 01:45:42,981
You mean you're not interested
in my Papa's wealth...?

755
01:45:43,266 --> 01:45:45,516
You aren't?

756
01:45:46,202 --> 01:45:50,776
She refused to marry you because
I have wealth? How dare she!

757
01:45:51,407 --> 01:45:55,621
I'll show her what it means to
turn down Gautam Mitta
's son

758
01:45:56,779 --> 01:46:00,192
You were worried that
she was eyeing your money

759
01:46:00,516 --> 01:46:04,587
And you're angry now that
she won't sell out to your money

760
01:46:05,788 --> 01:46:08,933
She's right too. Apart from being
Gautam Kumar Mitta
's son...

761
01:46:09,058 --> 01:46:13,987
"what identity do I have of my own?
- You don't need an identity, son"

762
01:46:15,798 --> 01:46:19,010
"I can buy anything for you.
Make him see sense, Uncle Dharam"

763
01:46:19,135 --> 01:46:23,811
"Dad, that which is not for sale,
you can only evaluate..."

764
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:28,686
you can't pay a price for it.
- Between evaluating and paying...

765
01:46:28,811 --> 01:46:34,240
"there's just a deal that takes place.
I know how to get around to that, son"

766
01:46:36,953 --> 01:46:40,423
"it's to settle everything
that we're here, baby"

767
01:46:40,823 --> 01:46:44,037
"Gattu and I...
you have no problems, I hope?"

768
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:47,705
Dad has no problems with the wedding.
Or Why'd he come here to talk it over?

769
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:50,975
"Exactly, sonny boy. You know how
stubborn Jojo can be"

770
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,945
Which is why I got your dad
to talk to her directly

771
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:58,109
Wow! You make nice coffee.
This cake's amazing too

772
01:47:00,476 --> 01:47:05,118
But I want you to make this cake
and coffee in my house henceforth

773
01:47:06,882 --> 01:47:10,796
Hritik is my only son.
He has always got what he wanted

774
01:47:11,787 --> 01:47:14,199
He's in love with you

775
01:47:17,093 --> 01:47:21,803
"I'm here to fix a date for
your wedding, my child"

776
01:47:22,798 --> 01:47:26,473
What do you say?
- I'll give you the same answer...

777
01:47:26,802 --> 01:47:31,615
I gave your son.
I do want to marry him...

778
01:47:32,074 --> 01:47:37,547
"but only when he makes an identity for
himself, apart from being your son"

779
01:47:37,813 --> 01:47:40,625
"I can't deny I'm
my father's son, can I?"

780
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:43,607
And who'd give Gautam
Mitta
's son a job?

781
01:47:43,853 --> 01:47:48,065
"You know son, we've given Jojo a lot
of independence in her upbringing"

782
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:53,196
"if tomorrow she decides to marry
Albert the mechanic, I can't stop her"

783
01:47:53,929 --> 01:47:58,105
If she refuses to marry you
and you go away...

784
01:47:59,235 --> 01:48:06,244
I'm going to say good bye to this
swanky 6.5 million car...

785
01:48:07,777 --> 01:48:10,781
with 2 billion rupees

786
01:48:14,784 --> 01:48:17,034
My daughter is a fool!

787
01:48:23,225 --> 01:48:27,799
I'm not a car you can let go
when you've had too much of it

788
01:48:28,798 --> 01:48:33,269
"I want to be a wife, for whom
her husband can make a home"

789
01:48:33,803 --> 01:48:37,615
On his own strength.
Am I asking for too much?

790
01:48:38,808 --> 01:48:41,152
"No, not at all"

791
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:48,160
Your words remind me of the woman
I once knew

792
01:48:49,218 --> 01:48:51,824
Who's that?
- A woman...

793
01:48:52,221 --> 01:48:57,227
who was my wife for years.
Hritik's mother

794
01:49:04,233 --> 01:49:07,612
I can now see why my son
is in love with you

795
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:12,522
"Shall we leave, uncle?"

796
01:49:16,178 --> 01:49:19,964
"Before I leave, I'd like
to know something, my child"

797
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:23,456
"You do love my son, don't you?"

798
01:49:25,855 --> 01:49:28,105
That's enough for me

799
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,560
This is not a bad place either

800
01:49:54,817 --> 01:49:57,762
"The Sun is in a hurry to set,
and you're eager too"

801
01:49:57,887 --> 01:50:00,137
So pop the question

802
01:50:01,423 --> 01:50:05,166
"Didn't you want to ask me something?
- Well, yes..."

803
01:50:10,866 --> 01:50:15,838
"Gauri, I want to start life afresh.
I want to marry you"

804
01:50:19,842 --> 01:50:22,092
To be honest...

805
01:50:23,846 --> 01:50:27,851
so do I.
- Really? ls that true?

806
01:50:29,852 --> 01:50:32,102
However...

807
01:50:33,856 --> 01:50:38,327
"I can't marry you, Dev.
- Why not...?"

808
01:50:39,295 --> 01:50:41,545
"Why not, Gauri?"

809
01:50:43,799 --> 01:50:48,339
"There's a time for everything, Dev.
An opportune time"

810
01:50:50,806 --> 01:50:58,816
And I think I have let it
slip out of my hands

811
01:51:01,283 --> 01:51:05,823
There's just Gaurav and me.
Apart from each other...

812
01:51:06,021 --> 01:51:11,334
there's no one else in our lives.
And he's always going to need me

813
01:51:12,728 --> 01:51:16,175
Always.
- Can't he belong to all of us?

814
01:51:18,901 --> 01:51:23,281
You are setting out in the rains
with a bundle of cotton

815
01:51:25,341 --> 01:51:28,117
Your burden will only increase

816
01:51:29,845 --> 01:51:35,659
It's very difficult to live
with Gaurav and understand him

817
01:51:36,118 --> 01:51:39,793
"Gauri, stop worrying about Gaurav.
He'll be cured"

818
01:51:40,022 --> 01:51:45,199
How will he be cured? How?
I saw the doctor only this afternoon

819
01:51:45,861 --> 01:51:51,311
"He says, with the help of
psycho-therapy and drugs in America..."

820
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:57,807
Gaurav can be cured.
But it's very expensive

821
01:52:02,945 --> 01:52:06,445
"l can't see you being
ruined all over again, Dev"

822
01:52:33,275 --> 01:52:35,846
"May I steal your cigarette, friend?"

823
01:52:36,245 --> 01:52:38,495
"Sure, but why only half?"

824
01:52:41,116 --> 01:52:43,366
I'm trying to give it up

825
01:52:43,585 --> 01:52:45,835
One large whisky

826
01:52:51,894 --> 01:52:56,465
Why're you staring like that?
- You don't look the drinking types

827
01:52:58,801 --> 01:53:04,808
"Yes, there is.
- There's a woman behind the problem?"

828
01:53:17,886 --> 01:53:19,930
"You, sir?
- To hell with sir"

829
01:53:20,055 --> 01:53:23,341
I've told you so often
not to be formal with me

830
01:53:23,826 --> 01:53:26,238
You too...?
- Me too?

831
01:53:27,629 --> 01:53:29,879
"You've met Krish, haven't you?"

832
01:53:35,437 --> 01:53:39,008
I've heard so much about you.
You're a great artist

833
01:53:41,477 --> 01:53:46,691
The greatest of the artists is money.
Which makes you the best of them all

834
01:53:49,785 --> 01:53:52,493
My bloody problems
begin with my wealth

835
01:53:52,788 --> 01:53:56,793
Love is sometimes based on
terribly unreasonable conditions

836
01:54:01,263 --> 01:54:05,143
"Take my advise, my friend.
Never fall in love"

837
01:54:06,802 --> 01:54:10,873
You ought to have told me earlier.
I'm already in love now

838
01:55:02,791 --> 01:55:05,795
Love...

839
01:55:06,462 --> 01:55:09,204
is meant for those...

840
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:17,813
"who, with the beloved's name
on their lips..."

841
01:55:19,808 --> 01:55:22,812
"will die, will be destroyed..."

842
01:55:23,979 --> 01:55:27,825
"and get a bad name
for themselves"

843
01:55:30,519 --> 01:55:34,433
"Forget it, friends..."

844
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:38,770
we won't ever fall in love

845
01:55:39,261 --> 01:55:43,368
"Forget it, friends..."

846
01:55:43,665 --> 01:55:46,771
we won't ever fall in love

847
01:56:31,246 --> 01:56:34,819
"A lost drink one can
always retrieve..."

848
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:39,098
"but may no one ever
play with someone's heart"

849
01:56:39,755 --> 01:56:43,760
"Should one be heart-broken...
the things that can happen"

850
01:56:44,026 --> 01:56:46,768
Love...

851
01:56:47,863 --> 01:56:51,367
is meant for those...

852
01:56:52,668 --> 01:56:59,051
"who, with the beloved's name
on their lips..."

853
01:57:01,276 --> 01:57:04,780
"die, destroy themselves..."

854
01:57:05,113 --> 01:57:09,118
and get a bad name

855
01:57:09,985 --> 01:57:16,800
"Never mind, forget it...
we'll never fall in love"

856
01:58:10,112 --> 01:58:14,041
"I'm afraid I might be hooked
when I look into her eyes"

857
01:58:14,249 --> 01:58:18,061
"The lanes of the beautiful girls,
I walk by..."

858
01:58:18,787 --> 01:58:22,792
with a distant salute

859
01:58:23,292 --> 01:58:25,795
Love...

860
01:58:26,795 --> 01:58:29,799
is meant for those...

861
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:38,145
"who, with the beloved's name
on their lips..."

862
01:58:40,242 --> 01:58:43,485
"will die, will be destroyed..."

863
01:58:44,012 --> 01:58:47,824
and earn ill-fame

864
01:58:48,817 --> 01:58:56,235
"Forget it, friends...
we'll never ever fall in love"

865
01:58:57,726 --> 01:59:04,837
"Never mind...
we'll never fall in love"

866
01:59:44,973 --> 01:59:47,223
What is the matter?

867
01:59:55,817 --> 02:00:00,630
"Sorry, missus. I had money
only for a single rose"

868
02:00:02,224 --> 02:00:05,171
"it isn't just a rose, Krish"

869
02:00:06,094 --> 02:00:09,564
"More than the fragrance,
it's full of your love"

870
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:14,176
What can be a better gift for me?

871
02:01:23,839 --> 02:01:26,089
"Happy birthday, Ms Raksha!"

872
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:57,620
Krish!

873
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:17,640
And I thought...
- Wrong

874
02:02:18,627 --> 02:02:21,984
"I'd love to die,
had I the courage to jump of "

875
02:02:22,564 --> 02:02:27,638
"Besides, I couldn't give you such
a horrible gift on this day, no?"

876
02:02:28,036 --> 02:02:31,465
Why Krish?
- Being your husband is a honour to me

877
02:02:32,574 --> 02:02:36,181
"And honour is priceless.
- Stop it, Krish"

878
02:02:37,512 --> 02:02:40,288
What are you punishing me for?

879
02:02:41,216 --> 02:02:44,216
How long will you keep
denying our success?

880
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:51,600
It's your success. Only yours.
- What...?

881
02:02:53,094 --> 02:02:56,803
What did you say?
- The truth! What else do I say?

882
02:02:57,899 --> 02:03:03,815
And what do I do? Should I dance in
joy because you are a successful star?

883
02:03:05,507 --> 02:03:11,355
"Or do I jump off, because
I'm worthless, a bloody failure?"

884
02:03:16,651 --> 02:03:20,929
"Raksha, you used to be so loving"

885
02:03:22,824 --> 02:03:25,074
"And now, you empathise me"

886
02:03:26,828 --> 02:03:30,366
"Look at me, and tell me
where I have gone wrong"

887
02:03:32,834 --> 02:03:35,045
ls it my fault that
on your birthday...

888
02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:39,516
my rose stands out like a bastard
before all the flowers in the world?

889
02:03:39,641 --> 02:03:44,784
"Your success, instead of a stepping
stone, is creating a rift. My fault?"

890
02:03:50,785 --> 02:03:53,035
I fell stifled

891
02:03:57,792 --> 02:04:02,002
I'll take it as long as I can...
then I'll die

892
02:04:04,265 --> 02:04:07,906
And you and I will be free

893
02:04:23,818 --> 02:04:27,197
What's going on?
- Madam wants them thrown out

894
02:04:28,823 --> 02:04:32,430
Where is she?
- She's gone out. Left a note for you

895
02:04:33,328 --> 02:04:38,368
"Krish, I'm quitting this house.
It could never become a home"

896
02:04:39,768 --> 02:04:45,275
"I wish you understood that my success
lies in your love, not in my songs"

897
02:04:48,343 --> 02:04:50,700
Perhaps you don't need me anymore

898
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:55,659
"For all my efforts to hold us together,
you thought I was helping"

899
02:04:55,784 --> 02:05:00,790
"I love you clearly, Krish,
and I want you to save yourself"

900
02:05:27,582 --> 02:05:34,830
You could give me only a rose on my
birthday... a priceless gift for me

901
02:05:35,824 --> 02:05:40,466
So I leave my priceless gift for you
But I promise...

902
02:05:40,829 --> 02:05:45,472
"l hear you calling me from
the bottom of your heart, I'll return"

903
02:05:54,776 --> 02:06:00,062
"Anything can happen. If Gaurav wills,
he can discard the wheel-chair, now"

904
02:06:01,783 --> 02:06:04,854
"Can he really...
- If Gaurav wills, I said"

905
02:06:05,487 --> 02:06:07,664
It's natural to trip and fall

906
02:06:07,789 --> 02:06:12,795
"but if someone doesn't want to
stand up, don't blame it on his legs"

907
02:06:25,073 --> 02:06:29,073
I have discussed Gaurav's case
with many of my colleagues

908
02:06:31,813 --> 02:06:35,091
"Physically, he can be cured. But
the advantage of spending so money..."

909
02:06:35,216 --> 02:06:39,255
"can be had only when Gaurav
decides to rise, and live"

910
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:50,631
Nothing works more than the desire
to live. Neither medicine nor prayers

911
02:06:51,666 --> 02:06:54,377
But the advantage
of spending so money...

912
02:06:54,502 --> 02:06:58,359
"can be had only when Gaurav
decides to rise, and live"

913
02:07:24,666 --> 02:07:29,411
What...? Why do you want
to go to Africa now?

914
02:07:30,805 --> 02:07:34,734
"Because Africa is faraway from here,
faraway from Jojo"

915
02:07:35,844 --> 02:07:38,094
"Running away, son?"

916
02:07:40,148 --> 02:07:43,925
How I wish I could run away...
I'm merely going away

917
02:07:48,523 --> 02:07:50,773
"No son, why must you...?"

918
02:08:01,302 --> 02:08:07,378
"Love blew his fuse. But what's wrong
with your brains, Gattu? Para
ysed?"

919
02:08:07,775 --> 02:08:11,154
"Uncle, don't call me Gattu!
- I will! Gattu! Gattu! Gattu!"

920
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:14,657
You don't use your brains at all!
- He's leaving the country

921
02:08:14,782 --> 02:08:19,262
And you take a dig at me? What will he
earn without using my name? Tell me

922
02:08:19,387 --> 02:08:25,394
I'll explain. He might be good for
nothing but my lion does sing so well

923
02:08:25,793 --> 02:08:30,401
Even his wails were rhythmic.
- True

924
02:08:30,798 --> 02:08:33,676
"Don't laugh. He has taken
after his mother, not you"

925
02:08:33,801 --> 02:08:37,010
Uncle...
- Singing? I never thought...

926
02:08:37,372 --> 02:08:45,484
Rack your brains then. Huge posters
have been pasted all over the city

927
02:08:45,813 --> 02:08:50,626
There's going to be a singing contest.
A big competition for singers

928
02:08:50,919 --> 02:08:56,631
"The winner takes 5 million, and...
what you call that round thing?"

929
02:08:56,991 --> 02:09:02,065
"CD.
- CD, right. Use it to find your love"

930
02:09:03,531 --> 02:09:11,109
"Son, you've always sung for medals and
cups. This time, sing for your love"

931
02:09:11,472 --> 02:09:15,511
"All right, I'll sponsor the show
and bribe the judges"

932
02:09:19,847 --> 02:09:22,097
No?

933
02:09:23,718 --> 02:09:28,667
"Dad, this time I don't want to
use your support to stand up"

934
02:09:29,624 --> 02:09:35,006
"As for using the passport and ticket,
I'll decide after the competition"

935
02:09:36,864 --> 02:09:39,114
"Son, listen...
- Bravo!"

936
02:09:47,809 --> 02:09:50,619
Yes? What can I do for you?

937
02:09:51,946 --> 02:09:55,018
Nothing... nothing for me

938
02:09:56,484 --> 02:10:00,697
But for the sake of your happiness
someone stays away from you...

939
02:10:00,822 --> 02:10:03,132
don't you care for her sacrifice?

940
02:10:03,825 --> 02:10:09,366
"Krish, go and bring her back.
Do something"

941
02:10:10,832 --> 02:10:13,082
Do what?

942
02:10:13,935 --> 02:10:18,509
She won't ever return to me.
She might not even trust me anymore

943
02:10:19,974 --> 02:10:22,853
I can do nothing.
- You can sing

944
02:10:24,579 --> 02:10:26,723
Really?

945
02:10:26,848 --> 02:10:32,134
"That's what you think, not others.
- A jumbo singing contest is coming up"

946
02:10:32,854 --> 02:10:38,133
Millions in prize. The winner
also gets to record an album

947
02:10:41,195 --> 02:10:46,804
"You will sing. And everyone
will listen, perhaps Raksha too"

948
02:10:50,872 --> 02:10:55,617
"That's fine, but for that
I'll have to win"

949
02:10:57,545 --> 02:11:02,995
"Let alone winning, I don't even think
I can participate"

950
02:11:05,553 --> 02:11:09,899
Don't worry at all. I'll get
your entry registered

951
02:11:10,224 --> 02:11:13,569
Why? Because I'm Raksha's husband?

952
02:11:21,302 --> 02:11:23,552
Could Raksha have sent you here?

953
02:11:26,541 --> 02:11:31,854
"Before I heard Raksha, I had offered
you a job, because I liked your voice"

954
02:11:32,847 --> 02:11:35,657
"Raksha was merely your wife, then"

955
02:11:36,851 --> 02:11:40,799
When did pride sneak into you?

956
02:11:43,658 --> 02:11:48,801
You relentlessly wanted her to succeed
but you couldn't take her success

957
02:11:50,398 --> 02:11:57,612
"You always drove her, sometimes towards
success, and now, towards loneliness"

958
02:11:59,373 --> 02:12:02,685
"if you wish to make your dreams
come true, learn to rise"

959
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:09,420
"if you don't trust yourself, at least
don't make a mockery of others' trust"

960
02:12:23,698 --> 02:12:25,808
Krish...

961
02:12:25,933 --> 02:12:29,938
"rise, fight, and win"

962
02:12:33,841 --> 02:12:38,984
"For winning, you need no permissions
nor recommendation"

963
02:12:40,781 --> 02:12:47,790
My voice is my only identity

964
02:13:01,502 --> 02:13:06,178
Contestant 18 is Hritik Mittal
of the illustrious Mittal family

965
02:13:06,541 --> 02:13:09,398
"No better introduction for him, right?"

966
02:13:15,816 --> 02:13:19,695
"Hritik, your name has been announced.
- She's not here yet. She promised me"

967
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:25,498
"Patience, son. Put the gear,
and step up on the accelerator"

968
02:13:25,826 --> 02:13:30,832
You won't win if she comes.
But she will come to you if you win

969
02:13:31,566 --> 02:13:33,816
Make it!

970
02:13:56,791 --> 02:14:01,001
"Last night I dreamt
of a maiden..."

971
02:14:01,529 --> 02:14:05,136
embracing me

972
02:14:05,933 --> 02:14:10,473
"And in the morn
when I woke up..."

973
02:14:10,805 --> 02:14:15,515
I saw her before me

974
02:15:12,733 --> 02:15:17,079
You can say I'm in love...

975
02:15:17,571 --> 02:15:20,575
you can even laugh it over

976
02:15:22,543 --> 02:15:26,491
"What's come over me,
unknown to me?"

977
02:15:26,881 --> 02:15:29,953
"Tell me, if you know"

978
02:15:31,752 --> 02:15:36,223
As she steps in...

979
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:39,969
why do I hear my heartstrings strum?

980
02:15:41,228 --> 02:15:45,438
"Last night I dreamt
of a maiden..."

981
02:15:45,833 --> 02:15:50,009
embracing me

982
02:15:50,771 --> 02:15:55,413
"And when I woke up
in the morn..."

983
02:15:55,776 --> 02:15:59,781
I found her right before me

984
02:16:27,708 --> 02:16:32,418
"After Hritik Mittal,
it's contestant 19, Krish Kumar's turn"

985
02:16:32,813 --> 02:16:38,027
"He's from Mumbai, and he wants to make
a mark only in the world of music"

986
02:16:43,657 --> 02:16:45,907
Tonight...

987
02:16:46,894 --> 02:16:49,773
I sing not just
for competition's sake

988
02:16:50,765 --> 02:16:55,339
This song is
for the one I dearly love

989
02:16:57,104 --> 02:16:59,354
Raksha...

990
02:16:59,707 --> 02:17:02,778
I don't know why I feel that
you can hear me

991
02:17:04,779 --> 02:17:09,136
I was in the wrong because I thought
you were not a part of me

992
02:17:10,785 --> 02:17:14,928
"I forgot that love unites two hearts,
it doesn't separate"

993
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:18,576
"Raksha, you're dearer to me than life"

994
02:17:21,529 --> 02:17:28,139
You promised to return if I were to
call you from the bottom of my heart

995
02:18:02,503 --> 02:18:05,780
What am I without you?

996
02:18:06,774 --> 02:18:10,244
From this world...

997
02:18:10,778 --> 02:18:17,787
I never desired anyone but you

998
02:18:19,553 --> 02:18:23,592
What am I without you?

999
02:18:24,525 --> 02:18:27,870
From this world...

1000
02:18:28,362 --> 02:18:34,802
I never desired anyone but you

1001
02:18:36,804 --> 02:18:39,054
Only you

1002
02:18:58,826 --> 02:19:05,835
"See through me, I'm love"

1003
02:19:07,568 --> 02:19:14,178
"Come, embrace me,
I'm pining for you"

1004
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:20,186
You have no idea...

1005
02:19:21,248 --> 02:19:24,661
"what I went through
looking for you..."

1006
02:19:25,019 --> 02:19:28,557
in love for you

1007
02:19:39,133 --> 02:19:42,011
"Yes, it's perhaps
the last and final call"

1008
02:19:42,136 --> 02:19:46,312
"I never desired
anything but you"

1009
02:19:46,807 --> 02:19:49,057
Only you

1010
02:19:49,510 --> 02:19:54,823
It's wise to miss the flight
than life

1011
02:19:57,818 --> 02:20:00,068
Right?

1012
02:20:23,477 --> 02:20:29,860
How can you stay apart from me?

1013
02:20:32,286 --> 02:20:40,205
"My prayers shall rend asunder
all the hurdles"

1014
02:20:40,794 --> 02:20:45,140
"You will have to come,
for my sake"

1015
02:20:45,799 --> 02:20:51,806
"For, you are the only one
who can lead me out of the dark"

1016
02:20:54,675 --> 02:20:58,282
What am I without you?

1017
02:20:59,179 --> 02:21:02,820
What am I without you?

1018
02:21:03,684 --> 02:21:07,063
From this world...

1019
02:21:07,688 --> 02:21:15,129
"I never desired
anything but you"

1020
02:21:15,929 --> 02:21:18,179
Nothing but you

1021
02:22:23,997 --> 02:22:26,247
"As I said, music is magic"

1022
02:22:26,467 --> 02:22:29,038
And we've seen
a glimpse of the magic

1023
02:22:31,238 --> 02:22:33,844
the last contestant
of the evening

1024
02:22:50,924 --> 02:22:54,281
I don't want to sing this song
all alone tonight

1025
02:22:56,196 --> 02:22:58,839
"Today, I seek melody
from a voice..."

1026
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:02,350
and crutches from somebody

1027
02:23:04,705 --> 02:23:08,619
It has stopped raining...

1028
02:23:08,909 --> 02:23:12,823
the clouds have cleared

1029
02:23:30,297 --> 02:23:34,245
It has stopped raining...

1030
02:23:34,434 --> 02:23:38,177
the clouds have cleared

1031
02:23:38,772 --> 02:23:46,782
"For a glimpse of you,
O beautiful one, I still pine"

1032
02:23:47,514 --> 02:23:51,189
"When will the thirst of my eyes
be quenched...?"

1033
02:23:51,785 --> 02:23:55,528
I lament all the while

1034
02:23:55,856 --> 02:24:03,798
"In the window opposite mine
lives a moonlike beauty"

1035
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:20,224
Alas! She's always angry with me

1036
02:24:21,315 --> 02:24:29,234
"In the window opposite mine
lives a moonlike beauty"

1037
02:24:55,449 --> 02:25:02,196
"Ever since I have seen her,
I have stopped lighting lamps"

1038
02:25:12,199 --> 02:25:19,208
"Ever since I have seen her,
I have stopped lighting lamps"

1039
02:25:20,807 --> 02:25:27,224
"I clutch my heart...
I go nowhere"

1040
02:25:29,283 --> 02:25:37,225
"Every moment, it's her beautiful
face that remains in my eyes"

1041
02:25:37,758 --> 02:25:45,768
"In the window opposite mine
lives a moonlike beauty"

1042
02:25:54,841 --> 02:26:02,783
Alas! She's always angry with me

1043
02:26:55,769 --> 02:26:58,019
Where to...?

1044
02:26:58,772 --> 02:27:03,778
You guys wait for the results.
I've already got my reward

1045
02:27:07,781 --> 02:27:11,210
The judges have chosen the winner
of this contest

1046
02:28:07,774 --> 02:28:12,189
"Looks like Africa's my destiny.
- No, it's okay"

1047
02:28:14,181 --> 02:28:16,457
No... you needn't go away

1048
02:28:31,098 --> 02:28:35,177
My first attempt has met with failure.
- See?

1049
02:28:35,302 --> 02:28:40,809
It isn't so easy to earn money.
That you have taken a first step...

1050
02:28:41,208 --> 02:28:43,458
is enough for me

1051
02:28:48,982 --> 02:28:51,232
"You've won, Hritik. You've won"

1052
02:28:51,818 --> 02:28:54,230
What is it?
- Look... over there

1053
02:28:54,821 --> 02:28:57,233
Jaswinder and Hritik!

1054
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:09,842
And here's your cheque
for 5 million!

1055
02:29:18,845 --> 02:29:23,851
"Nowadays, without a word,
when there's a blast..."

1056
02:29:24,918 --> 02:29:27,168
it makes your heart
skip a beat

1057
02:29:27,554 --> 02:29:31,483
And there have been three blasts
in my life this evening

1058
02:29:32,159 --> 02:29:35,265
"This one, this one..."

1059
02:29:36,863 --> 02:29:39,113
and that one there

1060
02:29:40,133 --> 02:29:46,482
I have a weak heart.
That one blast is enough for me

1061
02:29:50,076 --> 02:29:54,218
Each one of us here sang
for ourselves... for the self

1062
02:29:55,815 --> 02:30:00,821
But there is someone here
who sang not for himself...

1063
02:30:01,521 --> 02:30:03,771
he sang for someone else

1064
02:30:05,825 --> 02:30:10,831
"In a strange way, he's responsible
for this success of mine too"

1065
02:30:12,332 --> 02:30:15,245
"And I think, more than me..."

1066
02:30:16,836 --> 02:30:19,510
he really deserves this reward

1067
02:32:31,371 --> 02:32:39,188
"Fond memories are
being rekindled in the heart"

1068
02:32:39,946 --> 02:32:48,195
"The melody of our dreams
seeks the days past"

1069
02:32:48,788 --> 02:32:54,204
So sing a song of love...

1070
02:32:55,128 --> 02:32:57,378
sing with me

1071
02:33:11,578 --> 02:33:18,223
May our mood never change

1072
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:27,231
We shall never part

1073
02:33:28,995 --> 02:33:36,243
May our mood never change

1074
02:33:38,104 --> 02:33:43,178
We shall never part

1075
02:33:46,780 --> 02:33:54,198
"Where will you go away...?
You already belong to me"

1076
02:33:55,789 --> 02:34:01,205
"Fond memories are rekindled
in the heart"

1077
02:34:04,564 --> 02:34:10,207
"The melody of our dreams
seeks the days past"

1078
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:17,214
So sing a song of love...

1079
02:34:19,813 --> 02:34:22,225
sing with me

1080
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:28,226
"Fond memories are rekindled
in the heart"

1081
02:34:32,459 --> 02:34:38,171
"Fond memories are rekindled
in the heart"
