2
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:42,050
There are a hundred billion galaxies
in the universe, bhaijaan.

3
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:42,712
So what?

4
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,683
And in each galaxy
there are two hundred billion stars.

5
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,158
And around each star,
countless planets.

6
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,785
Get to the point!

7
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:53,460
My point is that you
could live anywhere else, but no!

8
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,022
You had to be born here!

9
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:57,192
Watch your tongue, bhaisahab!
This land is ours!

10
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:58,394
I'll tell you whose
land this is...

11
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,462
You may be frightened on
hearing these hateful voices.

12
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:04,099
After all, your country is
eternally peaceful.

13
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,774
But in a forgotten corner
of the world, there exists a land...

14
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:10,213
Where violence is a way of life.

15
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:13,775
Such enmity, that bullets and bombs
go off at any time.

16
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,881
Perhaps that is why
it has come to be known as...

17
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:22,050
Behold the icy peaks of
North Bangistan.

18
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:25,324
The polite gentleman who kept saying
'bhaijaan bhaijaan' - his home is here.

19
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,024
It is cold enough to
freeze their bones...

20
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,726
But the people here are
always hot-headed.

21
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:31,696
And the affectionate fellow
who kept saying 'bhaisahab'...

22
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,068
Hails from here. South Bangistan.

23
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:37,142
There are many doves here -
Messengers of peace.

24
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,303
Too bad there isn't
any peace, though.

25
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:44,309
But in their midst, there are also
two friends who believe that...

26
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:48,250
Through co-operation, peace can
be achieved here even today.

27
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:52,985
They are known to us as
the Shankaracharya and the Imam.

28
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,010
Please leave me alone. Yes, sir.

29
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:23,146
Greetings Shankaracharyaji.
My apologies for disturbing you.

30
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:28,415
Oh Imam Sahab, rules would pointless
if they weren't broken.

31
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,285
You must have heard
about the riots?

32
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:38,026
They have misused and
misinterpreted our faiths yet again.

33
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,129
They will never understand.

34
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,499
You and I can
help them understand.

35
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:48,132
If we declare peace together
they will definitely listen to us.

36
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:54,336
The upcoming World Religions'
Conference in Poland...

37
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:58,139
How about making
an address from there?

38
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,350
There can be no better occasion!

39
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:04,318
Then let's prepare a
proposal and...

40
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:10,122
And send it to all
the Conference attendees.

41
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,523
Let's do it.

42
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:16,196
Let's see, I've got
everyone covered except...

43
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:21,930
Would you happen to have
the new Pope's email ID?

44
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:26,911
Email?! The Pope and I follow
each other on Twitter.

45
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:32,109
We've exchanged a bunch of DMs.
I suggest you make an account as well.

46
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:34,480
As you say, my dear friend.

47
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,513
Good evening, good evening!

48
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,778
Thomas... Allison...

49
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:09,353
Hello... Jerry...

50
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,446
Have a good day sir...

51
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,490
That cheap man
was hitting on me!

52
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:15,924
Yeah yeah, just work
on the wool.

53
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,192
Whew, met the quota for the day.

54
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:20,026
Okay, thank you!

55
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:24,532
Haatim bhaijaan, haven't I
told you not to call me here!

56
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,935
I can make calls from here
but not answer any.

57
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:30,702
Yes, I will be at the
meeting on time -

58
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:31,799
Harold!

59
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:55,996
- Hello?
- Hello...

60
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,263
May I speak with
Katherine Polanski please?

61
00:08:58,637 --> 00:08:59,536
Yes?

62
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,299
Good Afternoon!
This is Harold...

63
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,774
Calling from Dream Savers
personal loan company.

64
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,310
We provide loans for
all your needs ma'am.

65
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,273
My needs... hmm...

66
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:10,371
Do you have any?

67
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:17,817
Oh yes, I have needs.
Please tell me about them ma'am.

68
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:21,320
I feel lonely...
Do you understand?

69
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,553
No ma'am, I'm never lonely...
Dream Savers is an MNC, you know...

70
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,722
Give me the phone!

71
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:30,002
Hello? Are you there ma'am?
Hello...?

72
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:31,631
Who is this?

73
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:32,993
Who is this?

74
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:36,267
This is Polanski.
Now who the hell is this?

75
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,210
Sir! I was just asking ma'am
if she is interested in-

76
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:43,373
Interested, you punk? What
is your name, you telemarketing pig?

77
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:44,973
- Harold...
- Tell me your real name!

78
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,381
Hafeez bin Ali, sir...

79
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,043
Hafeez bin Ali...

80
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:52,212
You are flirting with a terrorist.

81
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,588
- Andrzej, he's not a terrorist. He's just a.
- Shut up!

82
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,629
Listen to me, you mention
ma'am once more...

83
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:01,022
And I will personally send a drone
to Afghanistan to blow you!

84
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,730
To blow you up.

85
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,964
Sir, there's been a mis-communication!
I'm from Bangistan.

86
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:10,440
Nonsense! Remember what we did
to Osama bin Laden? Remember?

87
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:12,875
I'm going to ask Mossad
to do the same to you!

88
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,775
I'll have them cut
your head off...

89
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,211
And eat your eyeballs
straight off the barbecue!

90
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,214
Terrorist!

91
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,416
Thank you sir. Have a good day.

92
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,386
We are always here to serve you.

93
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,397
How long must we
suffer this indignity?

94
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,732
Just because we are Muslim,
the world calls us terrorists!

95
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,364
How do clients always
find out you are Muslim?

96
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,600
Work on your accent Harold.

97
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:45,007
My name and accent can change
for this job, but not my faith.

98
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:48,342
I was and remain a true Muslim.

99
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,478
I'm leaving this job.

100
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,480
Harold... Harold...
Don't get emotional mate!

101
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,572
Here, Guruji... Four lattÃ©s.

102
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,975
The Shankaracharya
has ruined everything.

103
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:28,015
If the riots continued
we would have won the election.

104
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:32,353
Riots are easy, Guruji. We'll burn
three or four houses during election.

105
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,650
You can't handle this.
We must burn at least...

106
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,125
ten or twelve houses.

107
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:40,157
Shut up! Low minded idiots...

108
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,893
Let's go international!

109
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:48,667
Learn from the enemy.
They capture the world's attention!

110
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,368
London... New York... Paris!

111
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:56,671
We'll have to make a statement
at this conference.

112
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:01,014
To multiply from one seat to a hundred
we must alter our strategy.

113
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:03,479
We must make a sacrifice!

114
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:04,812
Sacrifice?!

115
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,521
I will stop at nothing
to achieve this.

116
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,293
Nobody can stop us!

117
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:14,489
We will shed fountains
of blood and -

118
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:21,028
Guruji, this is quite a conspiracy!

119
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:29,207
Not a conspiracy, my man.
This is politics.

120
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:37,311
You know that local stud
who is dying to serve the party?

121
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,488
Let's use him.

122
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,856
A fierce war was fought
only for you, O Sita!

123
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:50,026
The battle raged night and day
Only for you, O Sita!

124
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:54,262
O Lord Hanuman!
Come save Laxman's soul!

125
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,139
Witness the Lord on his voyage
to obtain the Herb of Life!

126
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,768
Set forth, O Lord!

127
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,642
Jai Sri Ram!

128
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:15,859
<i>- Jai Sri Ram!
- Jai Jai Sri Ram, Jai Jai Sri Ram!</i>

129
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:24,294
Following his dashing entry
the Lord has set off on his quest!

130
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,170
How did it go, bro?

131
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,202
Absolutely awful.

132
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,771
Even though
the tickets are free...

133
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,440
There were more people on stage
than in the audience.

134
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:42,678
But once I become a superstar
people will shell out money to see me.

135
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:46,690
Yeah, people are staying at home
because of the riots.

136
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:50,726
Revenge, not riots!
We have taken our revenge this time,

137
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:53,264
This time, we didn't
remain docile like always!

138
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,493
Surely you don't mean that bro.

139
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,865
I mean every word!

140
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:02,037
These people stay on our land,
eat our grain, and rule over us!

141
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,542
The government, the media...
Everyone caters only to them.

142
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:09,479
I tell you, soon we won't
be in the majority.

143
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:13,279
That's good... The government
will cater to you in that case.

144
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:17,013
Man, you have ten heads,
but not one brain.

145
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,681
And your brain has been addled
by that Guruji fellow.

146
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:23,591
Another word against Guruji
and I'll smash your head!

147
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,494
Have you gone mad?!

148
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,499
That Guruji is a charlatan!

149
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:32,460
Help! Help!

150
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,437
Leave him brother.

151
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,678
You dare to insult Guruji! I
would happily give up my life for him.

152
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:42,507
The man is an angel!

153
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,579
Stupid Raavana...

154
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,399
Hafeez bin Ali! Hafeez bin Ali!

155
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,299
Wherever you are,
please come to rear entrance.

156
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,065
You are being awaited there.

157
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,342
Hafeez, let's go.

158
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:14,039
Haatim!

159
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,042
Obviously, the meeting
can't happen here now.

160
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,506
Abba has decided to
convene elsewhere.

161
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,881
- But... where?
- Just come with me.

162
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:28,859
Here?!

163
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,397
Follow me.

164
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:55,350
Ah, the mighty Harold
has arrived!

165
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,457
Get me a BigFac first.
Go on, get in the line!

166
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,893
Two BigFacs, please.
A few cups of the chutney.

167
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,556
I'm sick of waiting.
Give me my coffee already!

168
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,463
Yes sir, I'll bring it
right away.

169
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,225
Bhaijaan!

170
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:14,938
Thank you.

171
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:16,369
Two FcChickens!

172
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:19,934
We must convince Abba to keep
all the meetings here now.

173
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:22,009
Yeah man, there's no point
meeting at mosques.

174
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,984
Now show us the poster.

175
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,853
Such a bad quality print.

176
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:43,029
He is only fit to serve white people.
Hello hello, tring tring!

177
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:46,927
He's lazy when it comes
to serving the community.

178
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,267
No, Omar.

179
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:53,740
Enjoy your burger...

180
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:56,678
Harold!

181
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:02,512
Please call me Hafeez.

182
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:05,555
And I have quit that job.

183
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,797
You didn't quit Hafeez...

184
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,792
It was all Allah's will.

185
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,929
It is now time for you to
join your brothers and...

186
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:25,166
Dedicate yourself to the
good work of Al Kaam-Tamaam.

187
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,108
2417.

188
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:30,203
Abba he is not fit to work
for Al Kaam-Tamaam.

189
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,649
He couldn't even get a
good quality print of the poster.

190
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:44,190
It's not his fault, Zulfi.

191
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:52,029
Those call center guys have
brainwashed him by calling him 'Harold'.

192
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:59,337
This is pure American
propaganda, my boys.

193
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:02,739
I ask, what have the Americans
given the world?

194
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,685
Idiot! Regular again!?

195
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:12,150
Didn't I tell you I drink
only Diet Cola!

196
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:20,720
The Americans are
sneaky and deceitful.

197
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:27,263
They murdered our dear cousin
Osama in cold blood.

198
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:34,878
This is our opportunity to take
Al Kaam-Tamaam beyond Al Qaeda...

199
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:38,877
And replace cousin Osama!

200
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,448
What is the way forward?

201
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:47,146
Hey Guruji... Hey Guruji!

202
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:53,626
In life or death...

203
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:57,562
I seek refuge with him.

204
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:01,861
I'm off to meet him...

205
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,841
The one and only Guruji!

206
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:09,675
My heart beats only for him...

207
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:15,011
The one and only Guruji!

208
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:21,189
Hey Guru!

209
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:39,204
My humble greetings to you, Guruji!

210
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:48,581
This is a dream come true.
What a party you have established...

211
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:50,752
Maa ka Dal.

212
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,588
I am merely the founder.

213
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:59,954
It is the workers who
bring glory to the party.

214
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:02,898
You speak with the
sincerity of angels!

215
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,634
6 September, 1992!

216
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:10,765
Were you there? What a speech!
Building the nation! Uniting all Hindus!

217
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,337
Jasmines, Roses, Lilies,
Tulips and Marigolds...

218
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:19,782
Many flowers, all united
in one garland!

219
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,678
You heard me speak that day?

220
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:30,525
Not just 6 September! 27 February 2002.
8 April 2006, 29 December 2008...

221
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:32,262
I have attended
all your speeches!

222
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,089
Your words are inspirational
like heroic poetry!

223
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,726
Like pointed arrows
that pierce the heart!

224
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:40,635
They ignite the
audience's passions...

225
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:44,237
lnflame their souls...
Spur them into action!

226
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:53,844
Your speeches always inspire me
to beat up at least three or four enemies!

227
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:55,847
Guruji, we've found our man!

228
00:20:55,953 --> 00:21:00,015
He can't handle this.
He only beat up three or four enemies.

229
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:01,922
Guruji has picked
this man himself!

230
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:06,024
Our party is under threat and
this man will now save us.

231
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:10,431
Guruji... are we really in peril?

232
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,996
The Imam is ready to
embrace the enemy.

233
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:20,841
He is laying our Muslim brothers'
sacrifices to waste.

234
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,711
Instead, he intends to
fly birds of peace!

235
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:31,789
Just say the word, Guruji.
I will raise an army for you.

236
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:36,692
This battle calls for a conspiracy.
Not an army.

237
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:41,160
But Abba, the Quran asks us
to consider everyone brothers and...

238
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:44,930
We have considered them
brothers so far, Hafeez...

239
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:48,263
But have they
returned the sentiment?

240
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:53,766
So... How was the
show yesterday, Praveen?

241
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,608
Great, Guruji!

242
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,044
How many people showed up?

243
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:04,453
You are meant for much
greater things, Praveen Chaturvedi!

244
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:10,328
Maa ka Dal needs you today
to come into power!

245
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:13,987
Fancy a trip abroad? Abroad?

246
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:18,494
Poland!
There's a beautiful city there...

247
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,368
Krakow.

248
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:25,438
There, we must establish our might!

249
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:30,777
One of you must give up your life
for this cause.

250
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,947
You must sacrifice yourself!

251
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,082
We must create havoc!

252
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:37,116
Al Kaam-Tamaam! Al Kaam-Tamaam!

253
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:39,612
Suicide...

254
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,680
Bomb.

255
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:46,664
Guruji... bomb!?

256
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:52,361
This will be your life's
greatest and final performance!

257
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,565
Sacrifice is out of the question.

258
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:59,741
The door to heaven awaits
and the key...

259
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:04,180
Will be presented to one of you.

260
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:07,479
In heaven, you will find...

261
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:12,079
Plates full of exotic sweets...

262
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:17,485
The golden sands
of a majestic desert...

263
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:23,225
And one thousand and one
enticing camels!

264
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:27,037
Fifty one Arab horses...

265
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:32,775
And seventy two beautiful virgins...

266
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:37,674
Untouched and full of grace!

267
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:43,579
Patience, my boy...
Or l myself will reach heaven...

268
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:48,751
For this glorious mission
I have chosen...

269
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:52,219
Me, Abbajaan, pick me!

270
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,396
Hafeez bin Ali!

271
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:56,500
At your service!

272
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:01,700
Jai Maa ka Dal! Jai Maa ka Dal!

273
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:05,537
I have picked Hafeez after
careful consideration.

274
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,411
He speaks English
and talks to foreigners everyday...

275
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:17,344
And behold his beard!
Longer than anyone else's.

276
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:22,888
Will the bomb be in his beard?
I'll show you who's is longer, come here!

277
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:23,926
Idiot!

278
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:29,425
Hafeez will handle the job.
Right, my son?

279
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,533
Yes, Abba.

280
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,439
Here, Hafeez...

281
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:46,008
The Brits compiled
these about...

282
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:51,114
The lives of the enemy
two hundred years ago.

283
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:19,444
Abba, if I'm not mistaken... Shouldn't
we read the Quran at such a time?

284
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,746
This is known as
'taqiyya', my son...

285
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:26,485
Which means that
in times of grave danger...

286
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:30,994
To defeat the enemy
you must become him.

287
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:38,730
But at the conference
you will blow up the bomb as a...

288
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:41,901
sincere Muslim.

289
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:11,526
I won't become an engineer,
I won't become a dentist.

290
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:15,800
Mom I promise you
I will become a terrorist.

291
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:19,741
Friends and brothers;
I will kill everyone

292
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:24,007
I have the faith
and a strong belief.

293
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:28,279
Revolution, revolution...

294
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:32,185
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

295
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:36,253
Revolution, revolution...

296
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,319
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

297
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,890
STANZA 16: Love and kindness
to all living beings...

298
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:49,803
2:224: Peace and forgiveness
to everyone...

299
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:54,140
I have just one aim.
Complete mayhem.

300
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:58,281
Every terrorist is
my role model.

301
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:02,615
Terrorists always win,
history is witness.

302
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,550
I have the faith
and a strong belief.

303
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:10,719
Revolution, revolution...

304
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:14,788
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

305
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:18,933
Revolution, Revolution...

306
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:23,501
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

307
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:25,969
Praveen, what is all this?

308
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,508
You have to spread our ideology...
But you are losing your own identity!

309
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:35,644
Fooled you, didn't I Guruji?
Mama Mareech!

310
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,246
Mama Mareech?

311
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:38,846
Haven't you read the Ramayana?

312
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:42,215
Mareech mama used
such great makeup to...

313
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:45,296
Change into a deer and
alter the course of the Ramayana!

314
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:49,089
Similarly, I will change myself and
cheat the enemy...

315
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,967
This is known as method acting!

316
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:56,362
Even if I'm caught before
the mission is complete...

317
00:27:56,673 --> 00:28:00,906
No one will suspect you
and Maa ka Dal will be safe.

318
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:04,306
Then, once the stage is
colored with blood...

319
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:08,475
Drop the curtains,
dim the light bulbs...

320
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:12,254
I will have won my Academy Award.

321
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:16,686
Live long, my boy, live long!

322
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:20,453
I told you!

323
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:28,229
Dark days and black nights.
That's all we'll see.

324
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:32,601
We will quell the enemy.

325
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,848
Rivers of blood will
quench this infinite thirst.

326
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:44,846
I have the faith
and a strong belief.

327
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:49,085
Revolution, revolution...

328
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,891
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

329
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:57,425
Revolution, Revolution...

330
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:00,960
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

331
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:05,203
Revolution, revolution...

332
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:09,377
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

333
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:12,882
Revolution, Revolution...

334
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:17,117
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

335
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:37,938
Aren't you done yet?

336
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:42,236
A deep voice and good height
don't make every man Amitabh Bachchan.

337
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:46,478
You don't need any talent to
play the monkey in local fairs.

338
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,746
Calm down, you are always
yelling at the poor boy.

339
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,484
Why shouldn't I? He's going abroad
and informed us only yesterday...

340
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,456
Might as well have told us
from there.

341
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:58,261
And in any case, this home is
only a motel to him.

342
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:03,831
Uncle, please bring back
these things for me...

343
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:06,700
Yes, my dear.

344
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,469
Thank you, Uncle!

345
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:16,380
Yes yes, alright...

346
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:19,610
Come back soon, son.

347
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,191
Is everything alright?

348
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:33,587
Take care of yourself, ma.

349
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:47,940
Come, my dear Abba...

350
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,378
Promise you won't peek.

351
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:55,510
One... Two... Three... Four...

352
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:58,819
Where have you boys brought me?

353
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:01,488
It will be fun.

354
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,955
And... Open sesame!

355
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:11,693
What happened, Abba?

356
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,127
The enemy!

357
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:23,573
Excellent...

358
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:29,885
Excellent...

359
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:35,856
I couldn't recognize you, my son.
What chance do our enemies have?

360
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:41,654
You are going to lay the
foundation of Al Kaam-Tamaam.

361
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:51,336
All the headlines will
carry only my message.

362
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:55,402
The whole world will
know my name

363
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:59,410
I will be surrounded by
angels and virgins

364
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:03,579
I have the faith
and a strong belief.

365
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:07,784
Revolution, revolution...

366
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:11,486
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

367
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:15,990
Revolution, Revolution...

368
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:19,558
l will bring revolution
on my last day.

369
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,468
Passport, please.

370
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:32,909
Ma'am could you step out
of the line, please?

371
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:34,917
We need to ask you
a couple of questions.

372
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,546
You too, sir.

373
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:42,549
Sir?

374
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,891
Ma'am! L, Allahrakha.
Full family Muslim... by birth.

375
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,265
Passport, please.

376
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:59,707
Ma'am, please check. My name is Khan.

377
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:02,769
Allahrakha Khan.

378
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,676
Sir, step out of
the line please...

379
00:33:09,753 --> 00:33:11,448
Go on, brother, go on.

380
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:14,653
You must search us thoroughly.

381
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,256
In fact, I suggest you
leave no stone unturned.

382
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:22,225
The whole world is suspicious of us...
You make sure we are clean.

383
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,693
Am I right, my friend?

384
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,829
You are absolutely wrong.

385
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,862
After all, aren't Muslims human too?

386
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:31,975
May I see your passport, please?

387
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:41,675
Ishwarchand Sharma...

388
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:45,246
Okay, welcome to Poland.
You may proceed.

389
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,629
No, l will not proceed.

390
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,921
This is unfair. Why only
our Muslim brothers?

391
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:56,897
Everybody should be
checked as thoroughly as this.

392
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,731
Sir we just need to be
more careful these days.

393
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:01,464
Checking is purely random.

394
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:03,768
Random, my foot!

395
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:06,702
Don't worry about me, brother.

396
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,911
Do your job sir.
You do me, do me right now.

397
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:13,006
I think Hindus should be
checked equally.

398
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,681
No my friend.
Muslims will be checked first.

399
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,482
Hindus first! Muslims first!

400
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:19,681
Hindus! Muslims!

401
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:23,158
All Muslims should be searched
from their clothes to their soul!

402
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,161
In that case, Hindus will be
checked the same way!

403
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:32,165
Even our traditions say that
Hindus and Muslims are like brothers!

404
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:38,972
Here you are, sir.

405
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:42,239
Henceforth, all Muslims will
undergo such a clear check!

406
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,648
As will the Hindus!

407
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,172
Ishwarchand Sharma?

408
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:19,844
Tamim Hussain?

409
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:31,952
So you're Muslim, Mr. Hussain?

410
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,052
Nope!

411
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:40,766
I'm a foreigner. A white man.

412
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,969
Fifteen years ago, I moved her
from Bangladesh...

413
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:46,007
Citizen Hussain.

414
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,508
Keep my visiting card...

415
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,371
If there's any trouble, call me.

416
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:01,488
So what brings you to Poland?

417
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:05,724
In search of heaven.

418
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:08,355
Ah, I'll show you heaven.

419
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:48,561
Hey bro, where are you going?

420
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,670
You owe me 502? 50!?

421
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:55,041
You would've paid double for a taxi.
Plus extra for luggage.

422
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:57,273
You're lucky I'm kind enough
to give you a discount.

423
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,722
10 z? More. Why?

424
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,954
You have tip people
for their work here.

425
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:21,770
5 z? More...

426
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:29,677
Oh, it's you!

427
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,082
And you.

428
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:35,914
Why are you so surprised?

429
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:39,945
All brown, third world
visitors end up here.

430
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:43,720
We could've shared
a ride here...

431
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:47,759
We've already been quite open
with each other at the airport.

432
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:51,597
Hello there, Mr. Wildfried!

433
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:54,293
Two customers in one day...

434
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:58,940
You lucky old
Pomeranian, Wildfried!

435
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,670
It's Wilfred, Tamim!

436
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:05,140
Ishwarchand Sharma.
Your new tenant.

437
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:07,650
No wild behavior.

438
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,682
No tea leaves left
outside the rooms.

439
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:12,888
No betel leaves - 'paan'.

440
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:17,290
No spitting on walls,
no pissing on streets, no animals...

441
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:20,889
No goats, no lambs and no camels!

442
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,490
Goat, lamb, camel...

443
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:26,702
No sir, I drink only
mother's milk.

444
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:30,098
I mean, Mother Cow's milk.

445
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,097
Right?

446
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:34,672
2002? advance...

447
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:38,342
Please show them their rooms.
And Tamim...

448
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:42,511
Tell them I don't want a
single scratch in the apartments...

449
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:43,916
Not one scratch.

450
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:46,012
Here are the keys...

451
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:49,483
And your tip.

452
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:01,029
200?!

453
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:03,700
It is very cheap.

454
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:13,807
Salaam Alaikum!

455
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,247
There's a newbie.
We'll leave it with him...

456
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:21,918
Have fun.

457
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:25,825
Take care. I don't know if
we will meet again.

458
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,839
Pay Rosie for your drinks!
She asks me about it everyday...

459
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:43,975
Idiot!

460
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:49,281
So what do you think?
Excellent, isn't it?

461
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,818
You've got a great deal,
you know.

462
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,650
You lucky devil.

463
00:39:57,093 --> 00:40:01,030
A Krakow duplex at this price?
Nowhere else.

464
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,462
Duplex?

465
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:13,067
Enjoy your stay.
Have a good one!

466
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,308
And take care, don't fall inside.

467
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:47,731
Excuse me... Nice! Nice!

468
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:50,163
Did you hear?

469
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,540
Someone passed away
in your society.

470
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:55,474
He was a Hindu.

471
00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:57,436
So?

472
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,082
What do you mean?
Aren't you a Hindu too?

473
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:02,382
Er... Yes.

474
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:07,413
This is your chance to
make some local friends.

475
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:10,159
But I was just leaving to
get some things...

476
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:13,389
I'll get them for you.
You only have to tip me.

477
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:15,328
No, I have to go myself.

478
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:19,631
So go later! In an emergency...

479
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:23,568
Only friends can help you, alright?

480
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:30,975
(CHANTING FUNERAL PRAYERS)

481
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:46,355
Greetings, sir! Greetings.

482
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:52,664
Such devotion! Who can claim that
our traditions have been lost?

483
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:56,166
The deceased will now
forever rest in peace.

484
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:32,669
Sir, lend a hand?

485
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:40,073
These foreigners have far superior
technology than us.

486
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:45,786
Even this funeral will take no time
and cause no pollution.

487
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:49,657
No, sir. A holy wooden pyre
is just something else.

488
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,925
Traditions and rituals
are important...

489
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:58,028
Sir, please come with me.

490
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:03,366
Sir, pay no attention
to these people.

491
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:08,132
They have no understanding
of our culture.

492
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:11,880
Sir, I have a small request...

493
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:14,478
Please conduct the rites today.

494
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:29,732
Please summon the widow.

495
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:34,662
Why is she not ready yet?

496
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:39,299
Her husband is gone and
she's very old now. Why bother...

497
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,900
What do you mean, sir?

498
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:44,880
She is supposed to be
dressed her best for the sati!

499
00:44:45,214 --> 00:44:46,238
Sati!?

500
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,423
Two people can't even fit
in this contraption.

501
00:44:55,324 --> 00:44:59,454
On a traditional wooden pyre,
she would've easily immolated herself.

502
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:03,798
Anyway, I'll have her seated.

503
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,800
Sir, out of the way, please.

504
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:08,838
Put one leg here, ma'am...

505
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:12,602
No no sir, maybe it's best
for you to rest...

506
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:15,042
I'll perform the rites!

507
00:45:22,151 --> 00:45:23,880
Traditions have truly been lost.

508
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,483
Ah, friend!

509
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,558
Returning from a temple?
Found one already?

510
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,496
I'm in a hurry, I have to
make a phone call...

511
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,557
Me too! Let's go together...

512
00:45:38,668 --> 00:45:39,829
I need some clothes...

513
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:42,735
Take my jacket, I have two!

514
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:44,899
There's no need - No, I insist!

515
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,338
Please listen to me...

516
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:50,543
- You look great, like fresh eggplant!
- Eggplant!?

517
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:55,083
These clothes are so weird...

518
00:46:05,795 --> 00:46:07,320
Salaam Alaikum Abba.

519
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,099
Alaikum salaam! How are you?

520
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:12,726
I'm great. This city is awesome!

521
00:46:12,835 --> 00:46:14,098
You've been touring the
city all day?

522
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,195
I got stuck with someone in -

523
00:46:16,305 --> 00:46:20,208
Hafeez, you are not there
on vacation!

524
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:22,706
There's no time to waste,

525
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:25,210
Relax, Guruji.

526
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:28,181
Guruji, ask about the bomb!

527
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:31,852
Have you bought the explosives?

528
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:33,649
I'm just about to.

529
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:36,283
You will bring glory to
Al Kaam-Tamaam!

530
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:40,056
With your blessing, the whole
world will know Maa ka Dal.

531
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:41,993
- Khuda haafiz, Abba.
- Hafeez...

532
00:46:42,064 --> 00:46:44,192
I mean Jai Mata di, Abba.

533
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,333
Khuda haafiz.

534
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:50,966
Guruji, a great actor is
always in character.

535
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,532
Oh okay... take care.

536
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:57,376
Careful, my boy!

537
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:22,371
It won't stay erect...

538
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:25,266
Mr. Missile Bobbitsky?

539
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:29,646
Yeah... Mikhail Bobbitsky.

540
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:33,007
I'm lshwarchand Sharma.
I'm here to buy a bo -

541
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:34,913
Shhhh!

542
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:38,254
They are listening...

543
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:44,819
So you are here to buy potatoes?

544
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:56,597
Our potatoes are the best
Mr. Sharma...

545
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,470
We export to every pan of
the world...

546
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:25,726
Hello! Hello!

547
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:31,803
Me Allahrakha Khan...
You Huang Changping?

548
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:34,899
It is my privilege to
host you, sir.

549
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:37,710
I'm very pleased to meet you.

550
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:43,042
I hope you had no trouble
finding my humble abode.

551
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,617
No...

552
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,758
No... But... You speak Urdu?

553
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:56,964
A good salesman knows the
customer's language, sir.

554
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,574
Mr. Bobbitsky, I don't want potatoes!
I'm here for a-

555
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:09,509
Mr. Sharma!

556
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:12,571
You want potatoes...

557
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:25,421
Welcome to Area 52!

558
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,992
Wow, Mr. Bobbitsky...

559
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:31,822
Russian...

560
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,175
Cousin!

561
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:48,147
I need...

562
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:55,557
Relax! They can't
hear us here...

563
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,159
Have a look...

564
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:07,196
Welcome to Mikhail Bobbitsky's
Bombs n' Roses!

565
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,665
It will shake you up!

566
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:15,306
Are you looking for a bomb
that will solve all your problems?

567
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:22,177
Then your search ends here!

568
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:26,154
Cindy, no praise is enough
for this product...

569
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:28,714
The customers themselves
are witness!

570
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:32,555
It doesn't pay to be cheap...

571
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:35,154
In 1999, I Shut up!

572
00:50:35,231 --> 00:50:38,462
I bought a *beep* Ltd.
Suicide bomb.

573
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:41,902
The mission failed and
I only lost one arm.

574
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,173
Have some tea.

575
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:13,732
Any chance I could sample
the product?

576
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:16,198
Would you prefer to explode
here or elsewhere?

577
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:21,532
This is not a present
for your wife...

578
00:51:22,444 --> 00:51:27,382
This is a suicide bomb.
How exactly will you sample it?

579
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:30,779
But what if-

580
00:51:30,886 --> 00:51:34,618
Don't worry about the bomb.
It is Made in China.

581
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:37,587
Even our mobile phones
explode spontaneously.

582
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:46,692
This looks like orange juice...
Will it work?

583
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:50,763
Chinese goods, bro.
Judge it only on performance.

584
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,433
It will blow you to pieces.

585
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,033
You're getting a bomb at
the cost of a sparkler,

586
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,771
It's a great deal.

587
00:51:57,279 --> 00:52:01,375
If I had listened to my brother
and avoided a cheap bomb...

588
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:04,511
I would've been a
martyr like him.

589
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:15,259
- Did you hear that, Cindy?
- Yes, Tom!

590
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:21,093
Order now! Prices are on your screen.
With discount!

591
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,274
- Mr. Bobbitsky...
- Yeah?

592
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,010
Do you...

593
00:52:38,387 --> 00:52:40,219
Do you have anything cheap?

594
00:52:41,924 --> 00:52:44,018
How much money do you have?

595
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,016
Hey! Jung Nung!

596
00:53:22,698 --> 00:53:27,101
The Chinese don't bow.
That is a Japanese custom.

597
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:30,804
Jung Nung, go!

598
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:35,272
They just don't listen...

599
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:37,345
They're playing with
a ball of RDX!

600
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:50,451
Take your assembly instructions.

601
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,588
For such an amount you may
have this potato bomb, my friend.

602
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,296
And with it...

603
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:08,205
Here is a copy of
Bomb making for Dummies.

604
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:27,324
Thank you Mr. Bobbitsky!

605
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:57,283
Allahrakha...

606
00:54:57,393 --> 00:55:01,523
Isn't your beard a bit short?

607
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:07,195
All beards need not be honeycombs.
What does a long beard accomplish?

608
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,065
What?

609
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,537
A long beard and cries of Jihad
do not make a good Muslim.

610
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:12,096
As a Muslim, how can you-

611
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:14,232
You worry too much for Muslims!

612
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:16,175
You got angry at
the airport as well.

613
00:55:16,245 --> 00:55:19,408
Take care of yourself.
Muslims will worry about themselves.

614
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:21,074
Ah, here it is...

615
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,384
Bull and boar...

616
00:55:27,456 --> 00:55:29,652
This is the place Wilfred
was talking about...

617
00:55:53,348 --> 00:55:56,318
Looks like a bar...

618
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:58,417
So what?

619
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,522
A true Muslim has no
place in a bar...

620
00:56:02,057 --> 00:56:04,151
Isn't alcohol prohibited
in your religion?

621
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:07,963
Well, you can have some...

622
00:56:08,263 --> 00:56:11,062
I have never even touched
alcohol in my life.

623
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:13,092
Such devotion!

624
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:17,932
I'm very hungry, come!

625
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:21,408
This is such a strange place...

626
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,854
This is a great place...

627
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:38,286
Based on the exterior, you
can't even tell what's inside!

628
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:40,426
Two?

629
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:45,524
You're such an odd Muslim...

630
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:47,365
You are having
so much fun here...

631
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:49,302
And you were insulting
jihad earlier.

632
00:56:49,404 --> 00:56:51,498
Muslims have been persecuted
through the years.

633
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:53,466
The Quran says -

634
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:54,941
What does the Quran say?

635
00:56:57,546 --> 00:56:58,877
The Quran...

636
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,375
The Quran speaks of jihad!

637
00:57:03,452 --> 00:57:04,817
And what is jihad?

638
00:57:07,556 --> 00:57:08,887
Jihad...

639
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:11,850
You know... What jihadis do...

640
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:14,988
I see... And what do jihadis do?

641
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:26,266
How would I know?
After all, I'm a Hindu!

642
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:29,143
But as a Muslim, don't you
know about jihad?

643
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:31,235
And the Quran?

644
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:35,142
The Quran says nothing of
the son...

645
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:37,481
You've been hoodwinked
by baseless opinions.

646
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:40,285
Yes, the Quran says that
jihad is a struggle...

647
00:57:40,355 --> 00:57:43,052
But every man's internal
struggle against sin.

648
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:47,759
Most Muslims do not understand
the Quran. You're only a Hindu.

649
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:51,767
Haven't you read the Gita?

650
00:57:57,105 --> 00:57:57,663
Gita...

651
00:57:57,773 --> 00:58:01,471
If you had, you'd know the truth.
Oh, really?

652
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:04,535
In the Gita,
Krishna asks Arjun to...

653
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:06,638
Kill in the name of faith.

654
00:58:09,585 --> 00:58:13,215
The Gita refers to
righteousness. Not religion.

655
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:18,086
(QUOTING SCRIPTURE)

656
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:24,994
Lord Krishna says...

657
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,524
O Arjun!

658
00:58:26,602 --> 00:58:27,694
Yes, My Lord?

659
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:30,973
Overcoming fear,
anger and hate...

660
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:35,710
For the love of Mankind
is the truest form of victory.

661
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:40,973
The Gita speaks not
of our religious constructs...

662
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:45,349
But of victory...
Of kindness over cruelty...

663
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,286
Of virtue over vice...

664
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:49,516
Of truth over falsehood.

665
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:53,156
Really?

666
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,039
Dzien Dobry!

667
00:59:10,579 --> 00:59:12,604
It means 'Good Day' in Polish.

668
00:59:16,084 --> 00:59:19,247
Would you like me to
recommend a food order?

669
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:27,156
You're Wilfred's new tenants, right?
Tamim told me.

670
00:59:27,562 --> 00:59:30,930
Don't break his rules or else...

671
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:39,537
Won't you introduce yourselves?
I'm Rosanna. Call me Rosie.

672
00:59:39,608 --> 00:59:42,908
I Allahrakha! Call me...

673
00:59:43,979 --> 00:59:45,208
Whatever you like.

674
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:47,344
Ishwarchand Sharma.

675
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,784
Here we go...

676
00:59:50,285 --> 00:59:51,946
Poland's famous dish...

677
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:55,157
Ziemniak ze sledziem.

678
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:04,931
I'm vegetarian...

679
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:12,698
Come on bro, Rosie has
brought it with such love...

680
01:00:12,908 --> 01:00:14,137
Here.

681
01:00:17,479 --> 01:00:18,708
Thank you...

682
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:22,109
So what brings you to Krakow?

683
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:25,815
I'm here to become famous.

684
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:27,350
How famous?

685
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:30,693
You'll know when my work
is done...

686
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:34,385
In fact, the whole world will
know.

687
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,897
Why, planning to blow
something up?

688
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:46,298
What do you mean?

689
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,805
That just because he's a Muslim
he's a terrorist?

690
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:53,342
It's the same everywhere.
Aren't Muslims human too?

691
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:56,243
I'm sorry I upset you...

692
01:00:56,351 --> 01:01:01,084
Don't mind him Rosie, he's a Hindu...
He cannot tolerate insults...

693
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:03,591
Even against Muslims.

694
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:08,692
Okay guys, enjoy your meal.
I'll be back. Bye!

695
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:10,827
Bye Rosie...

696
01:02:03,585 --> 01:02:06,145
Salaam Alaikum! Salaam Alaikum!

697
01:02:06,988 --> 01:02:09,787
Alaikum salaam friends.
All okay?

698
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:14,057
Nothing is okay. Show him...

699
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:24,005
What is this?

700
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:26,904
It's a lamb.
We want to hide it here.

701
01:02:27,175 --> 01:02:28,233
Why?

702
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,539
Are you stupid?

703
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:36,308
We'll sacrifice it on Eid
in a couple of days.

704
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:40,386
Unfortunately, this Wilfred...

705
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,587
Doesn't allow us to keep lambs.

706
01:02:43,158 --> 01:02:45,820
You're new, so he won't
suspect you.

707
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:50,160
Okay, I'll see you at the Eid feast!

708
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:54,458
And take care of the lamb.
It is of a royal lineage.

709
01:02:55,036 --> 01:02:56,936
- Good bye now!
- Good bye!

710
01:02:57,005 --> 01:02:57,870
Hey, wait -

711
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:59,134
Good bye!

712
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:22,296
Amidst gunfire and notes of war.

713
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:25,231
Straight up or convoluted...

714
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:28,268
One and many, dazed and confused.

715
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,305
You push and shove,
look deep into the enemy's eye...

716
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:36,368
And act on what
the heart says...

717
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:39,072
I will fight the world!

718
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:41,781
I will fight the world!

719
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:45,352
I will fight the world!

720
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,855
I will fight the world!

721
01:03:55,363 --> 01:03:58,333
Kill or die,
I will do as I please.

722
01:03:58,433 --> 01:04:01,300
I'm not afraid of anyone.

723
01:04:01,403 --> 01:04:04,373
It's my story,
I write my own script...

724
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:07,374
It's my right, and I own it.

725
01:04:07,475 --> 01:04:10,274
It's my take,
the rest is unimportant.

726
01:04:10,345 --> 01:04:13,280
My thoughts, and my wish

727
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:18,342
I will not stop,
and keep moving on...

728
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,752
I will fight the world!

729
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:23,951
I will fight the world!

730
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:27,191
I will fight the world!

731
01:04:27,462 --> 01:04:29,863
I will fight the world!

732
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:52,352
This way or that,
it doesn't matter how...

733
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,321
The deed must be done.

734
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:58,325
I wield all power and control.

735
01:04:58,426 --> 01:05:01,361
In a deck of cards,
I'm the ace of spades.

736
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:04,330
I will smite the
blots that they are.

737
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:07,300
And run the world on my whim

738
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:12,967
I will suffer no more.

739
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:14,731
Tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick...

740
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:15,332
Boom.

741
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,742
I will fight the world!

742
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,748
I will fight the world!

743
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:24,319
I will fight the world!

744
01:05:24,419 --> 01:05:26,751
I will fight the world!

745
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,517
Oh no...

746
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:06,753
Police!

747
01:06:09,931 --> 01:06:12,525
Meet my friends...

748
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:16,605
Willie and Bahadur!

749
01:06:17,372 --> 01:06:19,431
It's Wai Kar Wong.

750
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:32,311
My God...

751
01:06:33,021 --> 01:06:34,716
What is this Tamim?

752
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:37,622
Willie, remove your glasses...

753
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:39,216
It's a hole!

754
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:41,793
We can see the hole Tamim...

755
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,724
Why is it in the roof?!

756
01:06:45,567 --> 01:06:46,966
Mr. Sharma!

757
01:06:49,437 --> 01:06:51,599
New kids in town. Desis.

758
01:06:51,673 --> 01:06:54,904
Missing home...
Trying to spend time together...

759
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:58,371
Duplex... Cozy cozy.
It's alright.

760
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:04,378
Spending time together...
Or planning to bomb the city?

761
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:08,552
Just because he's a Muslim
he's a terrorist?

762
01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:12,992
No no, you're overreacting...
Let it go...

763
01:07:13,328 --> 01:07:14,921
Don't get worked up...

764
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:17,096
They are only kidding!

765
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:21,068
Shut the hell up!
Don't be smart!

766
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:32,235
You are right...

767
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:36,207
Every Muslim is not a terrorist.

768
01:07:38,453 --> 01:07:39,921
You can also be one.

769
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:58,068
All clear.

770
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,068
Don't worry, don't worry...

771
01:08:01,276 --> 01:08:04,337
One day real terrorists
will come...

772
01:08:05,346 --> 01:08:09,510
Then guess who will catch them
and get a promotion?

773
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:12,519
Who?

774
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:14,745
Who?

775
01:08:16,157 --> 01:08:17,215
Who?

776
01:08:18,059 --> 01:08:22,519
You... You, my babies! You!

777
01:08:23,498 --> 01:08:24,727
Let's go...

778
01:08:28,736 --> 01:08:30,261
I'll see them off.

779
01:08:40,748 --> 01:08:42,807
Heathen! Pest!

780
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:45,850
You two are clear now. Enjoy.

781
01:09:23,157 --> 01:09:25,717
Are you tired, Bholu?

782
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:28,460
Want to sit here?

783
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:41,104
Excuse me...

784
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:43,936
How come you're here, friend?

785
01:09:44,045 --> 01:09:46,275
You're here too?

786
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:48,773
Come, let's chat!

787
01:09:48,883 --> 01:09:50,681
No no, some other time...

788
01:09:51,085 --> 01:09:54,544
Rosie was looking for you...
Let's go meet her!

789
01:09:54,822 --> 01:09:56,312
- Rosie?
- Yes!

790
01:09:56,624 --> 01:10:00,583
Let's go, then!
Yes, let's get out of here...

791
01:10:00,662 --> 01:10:03,597
Come Bholu...
Rosie is dying to meet us...

792
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,829
The Eid feast is coming up...

793
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:12,431
This lamb will be sacrificed
in vain.

794
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:17,569
The Quran asks us to sacrifice
something dear our heart...

795
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:20,141
To understand the true meaning
of loss.

796
01:10:20,815 --> 01:10:22,214
That's a real sacrifice.

797
01:10:22,483 --> 01:10:26,886
But these ignorant people just
buy a lamb and eat it on Eid.

798
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:28,947
It's cruel.

799
01:10:35,163 --> 01:10:36,392
It was me.

800
01:10:50,011 --> 01:10:51,706
You talkin' to me?

801
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:53,906
Who you talkin' to?

802
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,413
Me?

803
01:11:01,723 --> 01:11:04,090
Well, there's no one else
here...

804
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,455
You talkin' to me?

805
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:11,457
Me?

806
01:11:28,549 --> 01:11:30,415
Don't worry Bholu...

807
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:34,783
I'll destroy our common
enemies with this bomb.

808
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:48,997
There... You're Hindu now.

809
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:52,604
At least you'll find the right
heaven now.

810
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:57,770
Eid Mubarak, friend!

811
01:11:59,614 --> 01:12:00,809
Oh no...

812
01:12:02,483 --> 01:12:03,780
It's Eid today!

813
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:22,094
Bro...

814
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:25,933
Take Bholu, they are here to
kill him!

815
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:31,406
Where are you?

816
01:12:32,613 --> 01:12:34,877
Salaam Alaikum!

817
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:40,280
Allahrakha, you look great
today!

818
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:44,524
Hale and hearty...
You've settled in well!

819
01:12:45,426 --> 01:12:47,861
Come let's hug... Eid Mubarak!

820
01:12:48,596 --> 01:12:52,692
Eid Mubarak! Eid Mubarak!

821
01:12:56,137 --> 01:12:59,801
I can't see our lamb anywhere...

822
01:12:59,907 --> 01:13:03,104
Have you eaten him by yourself?

823
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:10,350
My friends...

824
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:14,186
The lamb has gone up.

825
01:13:14,522 --> 01:13:15,489
What?

826
01:13:15,756 --> 01:13:19,056
It went up? Up to heaven?

827
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:21,357
Ya Allah!

828
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:26,523
The lamb was of a royal lineage!

829
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:28,292
What will we do now?

830
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,767
It's all Allah's will...

831
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:09,941
Ya Allah! Ya Allah!

832
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:11,746
What a miracle!

833
01:14:12,513 --> 01:14:16,507
We only shed a few tears
and Allah sent us a lamb!

834
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:19,554
- Subhanallah!
- Subhanallah!

835
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,746
Friends!

836
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:24,683
What kind of lamb is this?
It has a mark on the head.

837
01:14:24,759 --> 01:14:27,729
The Hindu upstairs
has convened it!

838
01:14:31,465 --> 01:14:36,232
This infidel lamb cannot
stay here... Get out!

839
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:39,302
Get out!

840
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:50,049
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

841
01:14:54,755 --> 01:14:57,554
Ah I've found you, Sir.

842
01:14:57,625 --> 01:15:03,064
Everyone is waiting for you
at dinner... Come...

843
01:15:18,546 --> 01:15:21,675
Idiots, hugging away as if I
were a bridegroom...

844
01:15:22,316 --> 01:15:26,913
If it weren't for the feast
I'd have blown all of them up!

845
01:15:27,321 --> 01:15:28,755
A real Eid celebration.

846
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:33,888
The sumptuous feast saved
them this time...

847
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,198
lshwarchand...

848
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:42,532
lshwarchand!

849
01:15:49,477 --> 01:15:51,104
Ishwarchand!

850
01:15:51,912 --> 01:15:53,971
Where are you?

851
01:15:57,018 --> 01:15:58,747
Where did he go?

852
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,582
I can feel the presence of
God here...

853
01:16:34,088 --> 01:16:36,056
Bobbitsky... Bomb?

854
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,750
Must've been Tamim...

855
01:18:11,886 --> 01:18:13,012
This...

856
01:18:13,387 --> 01:18:14,946
How did you...

857
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:31,361
You great big hidden gem!

858
01:18:32,473 --> 01:18:34,601
I know your secret...

859
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:39,580
I'm here for the same reason!
I have a bomb too.

860
01:18:42,983 --> 01:18:46,385
Here.. my bomb's formula!

861
01:18:53,794 --> 01:18:58,288
Frock... Chocolate...
Doll... Pizza...?

862
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:02,700
Not that, that's my niece's
shopping list...

863
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:05,634
Come, I'll show you my bomb.

864
01:19:14,982 --> 01:19:15,847
So...

865
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:18,010
So you and I are on the
same side!

866
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:21,350
All this acting was unnecessary.

867
01:19:21,789 --> 01:19:24,588
You turned out to be one of us!

868
01:19:25,993 --> 01:19:28,325
You... Me...

869
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:30,853
We're both on the same side!

870
01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:41,702
You scared me...
But now you know everything...

871
01:19:41,775 --> 01:19:45,837
Say no more!
I've understood everything.

872
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:54,618
Like the two of us...

873
01:19:55,022 --> 01:19:58,549
We want the people of the
world to unite.

874
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:02,888
We have invited all major
religious leaders...

875
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:07,895
To the 13th World
Religions' Conference.

876
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:11,535
- Hello...
- Hi Rosie!

877
01:20:21,115 --> 01:20:24,449
You... For you... Cheers.

878
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:29,988
Allahrakha... This is alcohol.

879
01:20:30,457 --> 01:20:31,618
So what?

880
01:20:31,692 --> 01:20:34,718
It is forbidden in our faith.

881
01:20:35,429 --> 01:20:40,890
It is allowed in her faith...
It is a holy offering in Christianity.

882
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:42,927
I'm not Christian.

883
01:20:44,104 --> 01:20:44,798
What do you mean?

884
01:20:45,606 --> 01:20:48,200
But... Isn't Rosie a
Christian name?

885
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:51,237
What's in a name?

886
01:20:52,012 --> 01:20:55,312
Allah himself resides in his name
are you're asking what's in a name?

887
01:20:55,683 --> 01:20:59,142
Immediately, one knows that
this man is Muslim.

888
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:03,914
Er.. Just like lshwarchand
is Hindu...

889
01:21:10,464 --> 01:21:12,125
I have no religion.

890
01:21:13,267 --> 01:21:16,498
What? No Religion?

891
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:22,338
How can one live without faith?

892
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,911
All religions say the
same thing.

893
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,873
Be a good person.

894
01:21:28,515 --> 01:21:31,041
I try to do that
at all times anyway.

895
01:21:32,019 --> 01:21:33,748
So where's the need for
religion?

896
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:37,281
I'm happy... Isn't that enough?

897
01:21:39,893 --> 01:21:41,019
Anyway...

898
01:21:41,862 --> 01:21:45,162
Have a drink with me.
It's my parent's anniversary.

899
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:48,536
Oh... Let's go meet them!

900
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:50,465
They aren't here.

901
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:59,304
You've hurt her feelings.
You're so stubborn sometimes.

902
01:22:00,314 --> 01:22:02,942
There's only two days left
anyway...

903
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:06,114
She takes such good
care of us...

904
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,823
Even the Almighty would
forgive a few sips.

905
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:17,525
There's only two days left
anyway...

906
01:22:18,465 --> 01:22:19,591
My friend.

907
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:24,762
Sure?

908
01:22:46,527 --> 01:22:49,394
Come on guys... Let's go!

909
01:23:07,281 --> 01:23:10,911
Here we go to party tonight...

910
01:23:11,018 --> 01:23:14,477
And forget all our worries.

911
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:18,181
All of us have
the right to a hangover.

912
01:23:18,492 --> 01:23:21,826
Saturday night, full tight.

913
01:23:22,196 --> 01:23:25,757
A mix of fun and intoxication.

914
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:29,528
The end of all our worries.

915
01:23:29,636 --> 01:23:33,368
All of us have
the right to a hangover.

916
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,967
Saturday night, full tight.

917
01:24:08,008 --> 01:24:11,273
Paro or Devdas,
logic or nonsense

918
01:24:11,678 --> 01:24:15,046
Monday or Friday,
normal or dry day.

919
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:18,851
Boring or awesome,
serious or carefree...

920
01:24:19,219 --> 01:24:22,120
Life need not be black or white.

921
01:24:22,222 --> 01:24:25,817
A mix of fun and intoxication.

922
01:24:25,926 --> 01:24:29,590
The end of all our worries.

923
01:24:29,663 --> 01:24:33,258
All of us have
the right to a hangover.

924
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:36,963
Saturday night, full tight.

925
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:10,570
From cycle to metro,
or modern to retro...

926
01:25:10,938 --> 01:25:14,465
From gloomy to glitter,
snail mail to Twitter...

927
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:18,405
From uncle to aunty,
portrait to selfie...

928
01:25:18,478 --> 01:25:22,176
Take the voyage of dreams;
Saturday night, full tight!

929
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:25,879
A mix of fun and intoxication.

930
01:25:25,986 --> 01:25:29,479
The end of all our worries.

931
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:33,288
All of us have
the right to a hangover.

932
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:37,194
Saturday night, full tight.

933
01:25:37,297 --> 01:25:41,029
A mix of fun and intoxication.

934
01:25:41,134 --> 01:25:44,593
The end of all our worries.

935
01:25:44,671 --> 01:25:48,437
All of us have
the right to a hangover.

936
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:52,911
Saturday night, full tight.

937
01:26:10,864 --> 01:26:12,832
This what you call a hangover.

938
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:16,433
If I may say so...

939
01:26:16,503 --> 01:26:19,939
Green is a completely
useless color.

940
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:23,808
Have some green tea.

941
01:26:28,415 --> 01:26:33,012
Let this be. What we drank
last night was a lot more fun.

942
01:26:35,989 --> 01:26:40,517
Last night was fun.
No more such nights, though.

943
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:43,127
Last night was the last chance.

944
01:26:44,131 --> 01:26:46,190
We'll never see Rosie
again either.

945
01:26:49,569 --> 01:26:53,904
Can I ask you a question?
Heaven will be fun, right?

946
01:26:53,974 --> 01:26:55,533
Yes, of course...

947
01:26:57,844 --> 01:27:00,336
It must be...

948
01:27:02,182 --> 01:27:03,616
Is there no guarantee?

949
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:06,144
Not in the scriptures.

950
01:27:06,253 --> 01:27:09,348
Never mind the scriptures.
They don't preach violence either.

951
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:11,918
So then why are we...

952
01:27:13,026 --> 01:27:16,462
The elders have taught us this.
It must be right.

953
01:27:17,064 --> 01:27:21,729
But the elders didn't say why
the Almighty is so complicated.

954
01:27:22,502 --> 01:27:24,300
Why not let us
enjoy life on Earth?

955
01:27:25,339 --> 01:27:29,537
Maybe last night was
the Almighty's will as well?

956
01:27:29,776 --> 01:27:31,938
Just that He gave us
a short time.

957
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:38,282
Only just showed us these pleasures...
And quickly summoned us to Him.

958
01:27:41,254 --> 01:27:43,245
Don't be disheartened...

959
01:27:47,094 --> 01:27:49,324
Maybe He has summoned just me?

960
01:27:52,099 --> 01:27:55,296
You stay here.
I will blow myself up.

961
01:27:56,269 --> 01:27:59,705
No no, I will blow myself up.
You should stay here.

962
01:28:00,107 --> 01:28:01,597
So you can be with Rosie.

963
01:28:01,842 --> 01:28:04,641
That sentiment is enough for me.
I'll blow myself up.

964
01:28:04,745 --> 01:28:08,010
I can't let you do that.
I'll blow myself up.

965
01:28:08,081 --> 01:28:10,140
I have to go to heaven!

966
01:28:10,217 --> 01:28:11,275
I have to go to heaven too!

967
01:28:11,385 --> 01:28:14,184
Heaven awaits me!
It awaits me too!

968
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:18,451
Stop saying 'Jannat for heaven!
That word is used only by Muslims.

969
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:21,859
Why not?
After all, we are both Muslim.

970
01:28:22,195 --> 01:28:24,459
Your mom might be a
Muslim, idiot!

971
01:28:25,832 --> 01:28:31,430
Yes... My mom and dad are Muslim.
My whole family is.

972
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:33,830
Like you, Allahrakha.

973
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:37,376
To hell with Allahrakha!
A beard does not make me a Muslim.

974
01:28:37,477 --> 01:28:41,345
I am a Hindu!
My name is Praveen Chaturvedi!

975
01:28:46,887 --> 01:28:49,754
And my name is Hafeez bin Ali!

976
01:28:53,026 --> 01:28:54,619
Traitor!

977
01:28:54,694 --> 01:28:56,753
You betrayed me!

978
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:59,060
It is you who has betrayed me!

979
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:02,198
- I considered you a brother!
- Me too!

980
01:29:05,238 --> 01:29:07,673
You people cannot be trusted!

981
01:29:07,741 --> 01:29:11,336
Let me see how you
blow yourself up...

982
01:29:14,414 --> 01:29:17,782
This green color...
I should have known!

983
01:29:18,952 --> 01:29:20,647
- Put that down.
- You want me to?

984
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,313
Put that down!

985
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:23,651
Make me!

986
01:29:24,591 --> 01:29:27,561
I'm going to destroy
your bomb...

987
01:29:27,928 --> 01:29:30,989
Leave the bomb... Leave it!

988
01:29:40,273 --> 01:29:42,640
I'll send you to heaven!

989
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:45,542
Not one single scratch.

990
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:10,399
The terror suspects
have been apprehended...

991
01:30:10,504 --> 01:30:14,463
Two Bangistani youths
are said to be involved...

992
01:30:14,574 --> 01:30:17,908
lshwarchand Sharma
and Allahrakha Khan.

993
01:30:17,978 --> 01:30:20,174
They have been arrested...

994
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:24,445
But are recovering at
Mercy West Hospital...

995
01:30:24,518 --> 01:30:29,718
before they are brought to trial.

996
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:33,354
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

997
01:30:42,335 --> 01:30:44,429
There are others here too.
Are you mad?

998
01:30:44,504 --> 01:30:46,097
Those two are mad.

999
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,104
Bombed the place. Terrorists.

1000
01:30:49,176 --> 01:30:50,905
How do you know
they are terrorists?

1001
01:30:51,011 --> 01:30:52,911
The bomb didn't go off
on it's own.

1002
01:30:53,713 --> 01:30:55,681
You don't know anything
about terrorists.

1003
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:58,611
But I do know those two.

1004
01:31:00,287 --> 01:31:01,254
Excuse me!

1005
01:31:02,889 --> 01:31:03,856
Willie!

1006
01:31:06,026 --> 01:31:07,187
Willie, listen to me!

1007
01:31:09,963 --> 01:31:10,759
What the hell?!

1008
01:31:11,531 --> 01:31:14,125
I have nothing to confess!
I'm not a terrorist!

1009
01:31:14,234 --> 01:31:17,033
Those two desi rats.
They have to confess.

1010
01:31:17,103 --> 01:31:21,597
We would've had their confession.
We could've been promoted!

1011
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:24,776
Instead of that
we might lose our jobs!

1012
01:31:27,981 --> 01:31:29,972
No no, listen, listen...

1013
01:31:30,617 --> 01:31:32,210
I have a plan...

1014
01:31:33,253 --> 01:31:34,550
I have a plan.

1015
01:31:34,621 --> 01:31:36,020
What plan?

1016
01:31:36,089 --> 01:31:40,458
If I help them escape...
And you catch them...

1017
01:31:41,728 --> 01:31:46,097
Then who will become the hero?

1018
01:31:46,933 --> 01:31:47,695
Who?

1019
01:31:47,934 --> 01:31:48,594
Who?

1020
01:31:48,668 --> 01:31:49,328
Who?

1021
01:31:49,769 --> 01:31:51,737
You Willie!

1022
01:32:34,047 --> 01:32:37,984
Guruji has come to Krakow.
Everything will be okay.

1023
01:32:40,287 --> 01:32:41,413
Jai Maa ka Dal!

1024
01:32:41,688 --> 01:32:43,053
Jai Maa ka Dal!

1025
01:32:45,091 --> 01:32:47,287
I'll take him down now...

1026
01:33:19,392 --> 01:33:20,587
Hafeez...

1027
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:23,291
Hafeez!

1028
01:33:24,698 --> 01:33:26,666
It's me, Haatim.

1029
01:33:27,934 --> 01:33:29,459
Salaam Alaikum Hafeez!

1030
01:33:39,913 --> 01:33:44,282
I'm here now... Don't worry.
Take some rest.

1031
01:33:51,524 --> 01:33:55,927
Couldn't wait to go to
heaven, eh Hafeez?

1032
01:33:56,863 --> 01:33:59,093
You set off the bomb so early.

1033
01:34:01,134 --> 01:34:03,694
But rest assured.
The mission will be completed.

1034
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:05,870
You don't have to do anything.

1035
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:08,874
Zulfi will go in your place.

1036
01:34:09,509 --> 01:34:12,968
He was so adamant that
Abba gave in.

1037
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,714
Abba said, 'before
Hafeez reveals the plan...

1038
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:19,813
Send him to heaven.'

1039
01:34:19,919 --> 01:34:21,819
So I came to see you.

1040
01:34:21,921 --> 01:34:23,980
I've got you a present.

1041
01:34:28,728 --> 01:34:32,062
This is full of air.

1042
01:34:36,236 --> 01:34:39,297
Air... bubble...

1043
01:34:46,613 --> 01:34:48,581
Is your arm numb yet?

1044
01:34:48,681 --> 01:34:53,084
Calm down, calm down!
You're very lucky.

1045
01:34:53,319 --> 01:34:54,616
You're going to heaven!

1046
01:34:54,687 --> 01:34:56,086
Yes!

1047
01:34:56,523 --> 01:34:58,958
Patience... I'm doing it...

1048
01:35:00,026 --> 01:35:01,755
Transfer car has arrived.

1049
01:35:02,028 --> 01:35:04,053
We need to move the
terrorists to court.

1050
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:06,121
Yes yes... It's almost done...

1051
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:07,291
Hey... What are you...

1052
01:35:15,975 --> 01:35:18,069
He was trying to kill me!

1053
01:35:19,913 --> 01:35:25,317
Why, this sweet baba ganoush...
He kill a terrorist like you?

1054
01:35:25,585 --> 01:35:26,984
He's a murderer?

1055
01:35:27,287 --> 01:35:29,654
By the way, you two brownies...
You know each other?

1056
01:35:32,058 --> 01:35:35,153
No... I do not know this man.

1057
01:35:36,563 --> 01:35:38,964
Come on, you are going
behind bars.

1058
01:35:56,249 --> 01:36:02,188
Those were the days
when I was blissfully ignorant

1059
01:36:02,622 --> 01:36:08,527
I had no religion
when I was a child.

1060
01:36:08,828 --> 01:36:14,631
And then I had one,
and innocence passed.

1061
01:36:14,901 --> 01:36:20,897
All ties snapped with
my friend of another faith.

1062
01:36:21,241 --> 01:36:27,078
Is he dead or alive,
I have no word.

1063
01:36:27,447 --> 01:36:33,477
Your God is not mine,
my God is not yours.

1064
01:36:33,753 --> 01:36:39,749
Your God is not mine,
my God is not yours.

1065
01:36:52,472 --> 01:36:58,172
I'm ready for war,
armed with scripture.

1066
01:36:58,711 --> 01:37:04,582
My remaining days are
to be spent in battle.

1067
01:37:04,951 --> 01:37:10,856
It's in my blood
to wield weapons.

1068
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:17,063
Heaven or Hell, business reigns

1069
01:37:17,363 --> 01:37:23,132
I don't care how
beautiful the world is.

1070
01:37:23,469 --> 01:37:29,340
Your God is not mine,
my God is not yours.

1071
01:37:29,742 --> 01:37:35,738
Your God is not mine,
my God is not yours.

1072
01:37:39,185 --> 01:37:41,620
I won't let that bomb go off.

1073
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:47,087
Our bomb will explode!
Let my people come.

1074
01:37:50,363 --> 01:37:51,762
Nobody is coming...

1075
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:55,365
I had to come.
At the risk of my life.

1076
01:37:55,468 --> 01:37:59,166
Tamim! You turned out to be
a real surprise...

1077
01:37:59,272 --> 01:38:02,298
Don't talk to me! Shut up.

1078
01:38:03,176 --> 01:38:04,666
Terrorist...

1079
01:38:05,645 --> 01:38:10,583
You give all Muslims a bad name!
Still on about the bomb...

1080
01:38:11,317 --> 01:38:12,307
Shame on you!

1081
01:38:12,418 --> 01:38:14,284
But who sent you?

1082
01:38:14,387 --> 01:38:15,377
Enough!

1083
01:38:15,455 --> 01:38:16,980
I'll explain later.

1084
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:19,355
Stop the car, Tamim.

1085
01:38:19,425 --> 01:38:23,020
- Why?
- I said stop the car, Tamim!

1086
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:27,061
You third world people...
You can't take a leak here.

1087
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:30,365
I won't let that bomb go off.
Stop the car!

1088
01:38:32,271 --> 01:38:33,261
What are you doing?

1089
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:34,730
Stop the car!

1090
01:38:34,807 --> 01:38:36,275
Idiot, we'll all die!

1091
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,200
He was helping us run away!

1092
01:39:12,445 --> 01:39:13,640
Where would you run away to?

1093
01:39:13,713 --> 01:39:16,273
Anywhere!
My people are everywhere.

1094
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:20,176
Your people?

1095
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,816
My people came to kill me.

1096
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:26,418
And soon, yours will too.

1097
01:39:38,037 --> 01:39:39,801
Someone else is going
in my place.

1098
01:39:39,872 --> 01:39:41,067
I have to stop him.

1099
01:39:41,307 --> 01:39:45,266
Now neither of our bombs
will go off.

1100
01:39:45,945 --> 01:39:48,971
In you and l,
in every human being.

1101
01:39:49,082 --> 01:39:51,483
In joy...

1102
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:53,576
In sorrow...

1103
01:39:53,653 --> 01:39:57,248
In music and dance.

1104
01:39:57,690 --> 01:40:03,129
In the beloved and her lover...

1105
01:40:03,329 --> 01:40:09,268
There's only you,
only you, only you...

1106
01:40:09,335 --> 01:40:14,774
You are the eternal phrase.

1107
01:40:15,007 --> 01:40:19,911
You are the daughter
and the mother.

1108
01:40:20,379 --> 01:40:25,874
You fill me with
such inspiration...

1109
01:40:25,985 --> 01:40:30,946
That my name is now Rumi

1110
01:40:31,057 --> 01:40:32,320
lshwarchand...

1111
01:40:33,126 --> 01:40:34,389
lshwarchand...

1112
01:40:35,695 --> 01:40:37,060
lshwarchand...

1113
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:38,461
It's Hafeez bin Ali.

1114
01:40:38,531 --> 01:40:40,329
Yes yes, Hafeez...

1115
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,128
You've opened my eyes.

1116
01:40:43,536 --> 01:40:45,971
I'm with you now.
What's your plan?

1117
01:40:46,305 --> 01:40:50,970
Anything... I'll tell the police
everything.

1118
01:40:51,077 --> 01:40:55,605
And the police will trust you?
We are terrorists, remember.

1119
01:40:56,449 --> 01:40:58,178
We are on our own.

1120
01:40:58,985 --> 01:41:01,010
- Come, sit.
- No.

1121
01:41:01,954 --> 01:41:05,549
The bomb will go off
by the time you walk there.

1122
01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:08,293
Come Hafeez.
We'll stop them together.

1123
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:09,522
I said no.

1124
01:41:10,963 --> 01:41:13,057
Hafeez... I...

1125
01:41:13,466 --> 01:41:15,298
I can't do it by myself.

1126
01:41:15,735 --> 01:41:20,730
You fill the world with wonder.

1127
01:41:21,507 --> 01:41:25,637
You take away the worries.

1128
01:41:27,513 --> 01:41:33,475
Your God is not mine,
my God is not yours.

1129
01:41:45,731 --> 01:41:48,029
He's not coming, is he?

1130
01:42:08,588 --> 01:42:13,287
Here, wear these.
I'll go change as well.

1131
01:42:36,916 --> 01:42:38,509
Jai Maa ka Dal, Guruji!

1132
01:42:57,436 --> 01:43:00,064
To disguise themselves, people
usually put on makeup.

1133
01:43:00,473 --> 01:43:01,941
We've taken our makeup off!

1134
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,036
Let's go.

1135
01:43:19,659 --> 01:43:23,152
Go on, take it.
Aren't you hungry?

1136
01:43:23,462 --> 01:43:24,486
Eat.

1137
01:43:35,207 --> 01:43:36,470
Thank you...

1138
01:43:38,577 --> 01:43:39,942
For coming with me.

1139
01:43:45,818 --> 01:43:49,777
Come on bro, you're getting
unnecessarily emotional.

1140
01:43:53,225 --> 01:43:56,126
Can I ask you a question?

1141
01:43:56,796 --> 01:43:59,026
How did you change
your mind about the mission?

1142
01:44:02,268 --> 01:44:03,531
Praveen...

1143
01:44:04,804 --> 01:44:06,795
You taught me a lot
about the Quran...

1144
01:44:07,974 --> 01:44:10,272
And I have studied
the Gita deeply.

1145
01:44:13,112 --> 01:44:15,342
Eventually, whether
cremated or buried...

1146
01:44:16,882 --> 01:44:18,543
We all reach the same place.

1147
01:44:25,257 --> 01:44:29,057
We're trying to save lives
and you're thinking of death.

1148
01:44:35,568 --> 01:44:36,865
L...

1149
01:44:39,372 --> 01:44:41,340
I used to work in a call center.

1150
01:44:41,874 --> 01:44:44,673
Call center? I'm an actor.

1151
01:44:45,011 --> 01:44:48,072
Crowds throng to see me perform.

1152
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,740
Once I deliver my lines...

1153
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,413
Shall I show you?

1154
01:44:52,518 --> 01:44:58,116
(LINES FROM THE RAMAYANA)

1155
01:44:58,524 --> 01:45:05,226
(LINES FROM THE RAMAYANA)

1156
01:45:58,284 --> 01:46:00,184
You can't read the speech
off the paper.

1157
01:46:00,853 --> 01:46:03,083
I wrote it in Urdu
so you can memorize it!

1158
01:46:04,256 --> 01:46:06,190
Hafeez would've said it
in English.

1159
01:46:06,258 --> 01:46:07,521
Abba...

1160
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:09,785
Enjoying heaven's
pleasures on Earth?

1161
01:46:09,862 --> 01:46:11,626
Want me to show you heaven?

1162
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:12,959
Hide your face!

1163
01:46:13,899 --> 01:46:17,062
Bomb in a burqa!
What an idea, Abba!

1164
01:46:17,803 --> 01:46:19,601
Any news of Hafeez?

1165
01:46:19,872 --> 01:46:21,169
No, Abba.

1166
01:46:22,007 --> 01:46:24,977
Let it be. No time to lose now.

1167
01:46:25,511 --> 01:46:26,979
Come back!

1168
01:46:28,047 --> 01:46:29,242
Pick him up!

1169
01:46:29,782 --> 01:46:31,079
Pick me up!

1170
01:46:31,417 --> 01:46:32,384
There...

1171
01:46:32,985 --> 01:46:34,419
That way... Go.

1172
01:46:37,056 --> 01:46:38,148
Let's go.

1173
01:46:39,391 --> 01:46:40,483
Let's go.

1174
01:46:46,232 --> 01:46:47,961
The enemy is here.

1175
01:46:48,734 --> 01:46:51,260
We'll destroy them today.

1176
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:58,608
- Here for the conference?
- Yes...

1177
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:02,881
I wanted to support this
peace initiative.

1178
01:47:03,549 --> 01:47:07,918
Same here. Who wouldn't support
world peace?

1179
01:47:08,787 --> 01:47:10,084
Would you like some tea?

1180
01:47:10,322 --> 01:47:11,585
Diet cola.

1181
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:27,168
My phone isn't getting
any network.

1182
01:47:27,573 --> 01:47:31,874
You're using a typewriter
in the age of the touchscreen.

1183
01:47:31,977 --> 01:47:33,672
Time to get you a new phone.

1184
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:51,127
Welcome to the
Conference, ma'am.

1185
01:47:51,197 --> 01:47:53,894
You can join the others
right there.

1186
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,361
Please.

1187
01:47:55,434 --> 01:47:56,833
Madam...

1188
01:47:57,102 --> 01:48:00,697
Please, this way.
I will help you.

1189
01:48:20,492 --> 01:48:23,826
Alert! Alert! Car spotted.
Terrorists running to city.

1190
01:48:23,929 --> 01:48:25,328
Yes! Yes!

1191
01:48:25,564 --> 01:48:27,054
Drop this stuff.

1192
01:48:27,566 --> 01:48:29,330
This is our chance to
save the world!

1193
01:48:40,746 --> 01:48:46,185
I want to drink the
nectar of eternal life.

1194
01:48:46,285 --> 01:48:51,519
They say - die and go to heaven
but I insist on staying alive.

1195
01:49:01,867 --> 01:49:06,600
You want sunshine?
Bring your own sun.

1196
01:49:06,672 --> 01:49:11,906
I write my own destiny,
don't guide me.

1197
01:49:12,177 --> 01:49:17,274
No longer naive,
I'm street smart.

1198
01:49:17,349 --> 01:49:22,515
They say - die and go to heaven
but I insist on staying alive.

1199
01:49:22,588 --> 01:49:27,617
No longer naive,
I'm street smart.

1200
01:49:27,726 --> 01:49:33,062
They say - die and go to heaven
but I insist on staying alive

1201
01:49:43,309 --> 01:49:47,906
I insist, I insist
I will stay alive

1202
01:49:48,547 --> 01:49:53,314
I insist, I insist
I will stay alive.

1203
01:49:56,188 --> 01:49:57,280
What now?

1204
01:50:11,937 --> 01:50:13,769
We've got to stop Zulfi.

1205
01:50:14,406 --> 01:50:16,932
You go that way.
I'll check this side.

1206
01:52:12,458 --> 01:52:14,950
Will people listen this time?

1207
01:52:15,327 --> 01:52:19,286
This time we'll try together.

1208
01:52:19,631 --> 01:52:22,066
The rest is in God's hands.

1209
01:52:33,545 --> 01:52:36,810
Hafeez... This...
Someone else also...

1210
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:42,218
This bomb... I...
Good thing we got here -

1211
01:52:48,327 --> 01:52:50,193
You made a call, didn't you?

1212
01:52:54,433 --> 01:52:55,798
Get out of my way.

1213
01:52:55,901 --> 01:52:58,131
You turned out to be
an awful actor...

1214
01:52:59,238 --> 01:53:00,706
Anyone would catch you.

1215
01:53:05,978 --> 01:53:08,174
Let me go! Are you in a hurry?

1216
01:53:08,247 --> 01:53:09,373
Yes!

1217
01:53:15,621 --> 01:53:17,020
I must have revenge!

1218
01:53:22,794 --> 01:53:24,489
Revenge against whom?

1219
01:53:24,563 --> 01:53:25,962
Who is our enemy?

1220
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,864
Do you know his name?
Have you seen his face?

1221
01:53:31,169 --> 01:53:33,331
You're just out to kill
randomly.

1222
01:53:49,321 --> 01:53:51,153
I'll detonate the bomb...

1223
01:53:51,723 --> 01:53:53,157
I'll detonate the bomb!

1224
01:53:56,061 --> 01:53:57,722
I'll detonate it.

1225
01:53:59,197 --> 01:54:00,596
Detonate it.

1226
01:54:03,602 --> 01:54:06,469
I'm not kidding...
I'll press it!

1227
01:54:11,643 --> 01:54:14,578
Who's stopping you? Press it.

1228
01:54:21,954 --> 01:54:24,013
Afraid of death?

1229
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:30,292
I'm not afraid! I know you!
How can I kill you?

1230
01:54:33,699 --> 01:54:37,897
Praveen Chaturvedi...
You can't kill anyone.

1231
01:54:39,404 --> 01:54:43,307
You couldn't kill a little lamb.
How will you kill all these people?

1232
01:54:44,843 --> 01:54:48,780
"Your people" are not those
behind this mission.

1233
01:54:50,515 --> 01:54:55,476
"Your people" is your family. Like
little girl who is waiting for you.

1234
01:54:57,723 --> 01:54:59,213
Hadn't she requested
for presents?

1235
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,126
Go...

1236
01:55:11,003 --> 01:55:12,732
Go back to your people, brother.

1237
01:55:56,548 --> 01:55:59,711
And now, a few words by
the Shankaracharya and the Imam...

1238
01:55:59,785 --> 01:56:02,686
Before we proceed to the
main conference hall.

1239
01:56:03,789 --> 01:56:04,847
Out of my way.

1240
01:56:05,223 --> 01:56:06,520
Let's get this over with.

1241
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:09,424
Greetings everybody!

1242
01:56:10,395 --> 01:56:13,854
A warm welcome to all of you...

1243
01:56:14,466 --> 01:56:16,594
A warm welcome to
you too madam -

1244
01:56:19,104 --> 01:56:21,368
This is uncalled for... Out!

1245
01:56:38,323 --> 01:56:40,724
Why have I come here?

1246
01:56:41,393 --> 01:56:44,158
Why have I come here in a burqa?

1247
01:56:44,596 --> 01:56:45,757
Zulfi!

1248
01:56:46,198 --> 01:56:48,462
I have come here to proclaim...

1249
01:56:51,002 --> 01:56:52,663
Er... What am I here
to proclaim again...?

1250
01:56:53,004 --> 01:56:54,403
I've got to stop him.

1251
01:56:57,242 --> 01:57:01,873
There is only one
true faith in the world.

1252
01:57:04,683 --> 01:57:09,245
We are all pan of that faith.

1253
01:57:12,624 --> 01:57:15,616
All religions are
born from this faith...

1254
01:57:15,694 --> 01:57:18,891
And will one day
be swallowed by it.

1255
01:57:33,078 --> 01:57:36,605
All religions are tied
together by this faith...

1256
01:57:36,715 --> 01:57:40,083
And must bow down to it!

1257
01:57:40,185 --> 01:57:41,846
Somethings not right.

1258
01:57:42,154 --> 01:57:43,383
Today...

1259
01:57:44,756 --> 01:57:47,589
Today I will...

1260
01:57:49,394 --> 01:57:51,260
Show the world...

1261
01:58:00,172 --> 01:58:02,937
How did he get in there?
Inside, now!

1262
01:58:03,041 --> 01:58:08,036
What's this? Looks like trouble.
Inside, now!

1263
01:58:09,748 --> 01:58:12,410
I understand that sir, but the
presence of authorities here...

1264
01:58:12,484 --> 01:58:14,509
Goes against the spirit
of the Conference.

1265
01:58:16,154 --> 01:58:19,419
There are terrorists inside!
That's very racist, sir.

1266
01:58:19,891 --> 01:58:21,825
Sir, stop!

1267
01:58:32,103 --> 01:58:35,232
Stop, surrender terrorist!
He has a bomb!

1268
01:58:35,307 --> 01:58:39,972
Everybody get down!
Everybody get down!

1269
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:51,815
Isn't that Harold?
Why is he in Poland?

1270
01:58:55,227 --> 01:58:57,924
Not now, son.
Only after we leave.

1271
01:58:58,029 --> 01:58:59,190
Why?

1272
01:59:00,565 --> 01:59:02,090
Don't you want to go to heaven?

1273
01:59:11,409 --> 01:59:13,741
- We'll go together, Abba.
- No, son, no!

1274
01:59:13,812 --> 01:59:15,211
Get him under control!

1275
01:59:15,313 --> 01:59:16,974
Oh my Lord,
forgive us our sins..

1276
01:59:17,048 --> 01:59:19,073
Save us from the
fires of hell...

1277
01:59:19,251 --> 01:59:21,310
Oh dear God, save us from
these terrorists.

1278
01:59:21,386 --> 01:59:23,878
Quiet! Enough!

1279
01:59:23,955 --> 01:59:27,220
I am not a terrorist!

1280
01:59:30,095 --> 01:59:31,563
Done talking to Him?

1281
01:59:32,364 --> 01:59:36,699
This Almighty...
How does He communicate?

1282
01:59:38,403 --> 01:59:39,996
Does He call?

1283
01:59:40,672 --> 01:59:41,935
Or email?

1284
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:45,340
Or send a courier?
How does He communicate?

1285
01:59:48,213 --> 01:59:50,807
If He wishes, He can
communicate directly to us.

1286
01:59:50,916 --> 01:59:52,714
He doesn't need middlemen!

1287
01:59:52,784 --> 01:59:56,311
A terrorist imparting wisdom.
Who will listen to you?

1288
01:59:56,721 --> 01:59:58,348
I have listened to him!

1289
02:00:06,998 --> 02:00:10,491
Greetings, Guruji. All okay?

1290
02:00:11,002 --> 02:00:16,304
Don't forget him, Hafeez.
He'll come to heaven too. Right?

1291
02:00:22,881 --> 02:00:25,873
Auntie, put on the TV.
Praveen is on the news.

1292
02:00:26,384 --> 02:00:27,317
Praveen?

1293
02:00:27,419 --> 02:00:31,356
Threatening us with guns?
We'll blow up the bomb.

1294
02:00:31,823 --> 02:00:35,020
Put them down.
Let us finish talking.

1295
02:00:35,093 --> 02:00:37,858
Go on Hafeez.
They have to listen to us.

1296
02:00:37,963 --> 02:00:39,658
But who to talk to?

1297
02:00:40,298 --> 02:00:44,030
Here's a Hindu,
a Muslim, a Christian...

1298
02:00:44,102 --> 02:00:46,696
And you, sir...

1299
02:00:46,738 --> 02:00:50,732
I don't even know your faith.
There are too many to count.

1300
02:00:52,077 --> 02:00:55,411
But all faiths are only doors...

1301
02:00:55,714 --> 02:00:59,116
Open any of them,
you'll enter the same house.

1302
02:01:01,052 --> 02:01:05,216
Oh wow...
There are 4231 religions...

1303
02:01:05,323 --> 02:01:08,850
And we're going on about
our own faiths. You know why?

1304
02:01:10,161 --> 02:01:13,620
Because we were never
taught about other faiths.

1305
02:01:13,898 --> 02:01:18,460
Don't be afraid of us.
We're only the means to an end.

1306
02:01:18,536 --> 02:01:22,769
Be afraid of the hatred
we are teaching our children.

1307
02:01:26,845 --> 02:01:31,612
If my child is killed, I should
try and save all other children.

1308
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:35,944
Instead here I am, avenging
my faith with a bomb!

1309
02:01:36,054 --> 02:01:38,216
Sir, no matter which
faith wins...

1310
02:01:39,024 --> 02:01:40,753
It is humanity that loses.

1311
02:01:47,265 --> 02:01:50,565
If you and I exchanged places...

1312
02:01:51,036 --> 02:01:53,198
We would understand
each other better.

1313
02:01:53,538 --> 02:01:56,530
All we have to do is
bridge the divide.

1314
02:02:00,412 --> 02:02:02,346
We already know this
in our hearts...

1315
02:02:04,649 --> 02:02:06,083
Let's embrace it.

1316
02:02:09,421 --> 02:02:10,718
I have.

1317
02:02:12,757 --> 02:02:14,088
He has.

1318
02:02:32,177 --> 02:02:33,508
You can arrest us now.

1319
02:03:30,668 --> 02:03:33,194
Praveen, I'm glad to
have met you.

1320
02:03:33,671 --> 02:03:35,139
Me too.

1321
02:04:11,709 --> 02:04:16,044
The two young men who
were presumed terrorists...

1322
02:04:16,147 --> 02:04:19,117
Have actually sacrificed
themselves to save everyone.

1323
02:04:30,728 --> 02:04:34,187
The death of the saviours
is deeply saddening...

1324
02:04:34,632 --> 02:04:37,101
Their sacrifice will not
be in vain.

1325
02:05:25,683 --> 02:05:27,014
Hafeez...

1326
02:05:28,553 --> 02:05:29,918
Hafeez...

1327
02:05:45,503 --> 02:05:53,775
I want to drink the
nectar of eternal life.

1328
02:05:55,113 --> 02:06:03,180
They say - die and go to heaven
but I insist on staying alive

1329
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:21,230
I want to drink the
nectar of eternal life.

1330
02:06:21,306 --> 02:06:26,437
They say - die and go to heaven
but I insist on staying alive.

1331
02:06:36,854 --> 02:06:41,985
Today is mine, I'll live it up.

1332
02:06:42,093 --> 02:06:47,190
We'll see about tomorrow
when it comes.

1333
02:06:47,265 --> 02:06:52,294
The embers of my heart
will set the world alight.

1334
02:06:52,370 --> 02:06:57,536
They say - die and go to heaven
but I insist on staying alive.

1335
02:06:57,642 --> 02:07:02,773
The embers of my heart
will set the world alight.

1336
02:07:02,847 --> 02:07:08,251
They say - die and go to heaven
but I insist on staying alive

1337
02:07:18,296 --> 02:07:23,496
I insist, I insist
I will stay alive

1338
02:07:23,568 --> 02:07:28,529
I insist, I insist
I will stay alive.

1339
02:07:35,546 --> 02:07:39,540
Useless bomb... Must be Chinese.

1340
02:07:42,019 --> 02:07:43,248
Goddamn it!

1341
02:07:43,272 --> 02:07:59,272
