1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:53,742
No... please don't shoot

3
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:57,032
I'm willing to do as you say.
I made a mistake

4
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:00,526
I'll never make this mistake again

5
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:04,899
I have three wives...
they'll all be widowed

6
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:10,767
I have 13 children and 26 dogs...
they'll all be orphaned

7
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:21,589
The moment I held the gun
to his temple...

8
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,170
the colour drained out
of his face!

9
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:32,494
Bloody lawyer!

10
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:36,365
"What mistake did
the lawyer make, sir?"

11
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:42,736
He walked into my bedroom to tell me
that the cops were looking for me

12
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,940
Without even knocking on the door.
- Is that all?

13
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,979
Did you treat the lawyer like a dog
for just that much?

14
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,017
Moron! I was in bed with his wife!

15
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,514
Wouldn't I get bugged?
- What then?

16
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,637
"You know, I'm a large-hearted man."

17
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:59,218
"Before dumping him in the sea,
I felt pity for him"

18
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,507
"I didn't want to torture the poor guy,
so I killed him just like that"

19
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:06,420
I dragged him by the neck and took him
to the terrace. I gave him a choice

20
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,540
"Will you jump on your own?
Or must I push you?"

21
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,286
That was it!

22
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:17,242
He started screaming
Killed me... help

23
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:24,988
Is someone there...?

24
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,621
Daddy has got a heart-attack

25
00:04:54,622 --> 00:05:00,245
Call the ambulance. Hurry up.
- Call his son. At once!

26
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:59,435
This is treason

27
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:04,094
What did you say?
- That gun is sold to someone else

28
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:10,005
Your father and Guru Gulab Khatri made
a deal. No double-crossing the boss

29
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:13,917
What's stopping me?
- My loyalty to the boss

30
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:53,669
You must take this pill.
- Pill...?

31
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,665
You'll feed me a pill? You're
the one who's taking a pill if I die

32
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:02,535
I'm not going to spare you

33
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:04,241
Lawyer...

34
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:07,863
"Please, put that gun away.
Else, I'll end up just like you"

35
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:11,317
Phone...
- I have telephoned your son

36
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:14,564
He should be coming.
- Moron! Not my son

37
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:19,268
I told you to call my son-in-law.
My son is a son of a mule

38
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:26,761
My daughter's husband... he's a gem!
Where is my son-in-law?

39
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,926
Where is Guru?

40
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:59,016
"Your father-in-law is in hospital.
Get over, quick"

41
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:33,935
"How did this happen?
- It's over, son. I've little time"

42
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,097
I got to let you in on something
I've hidden from you all along

43
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:42,843
What is it?
- Last year out of the American deal...

44
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:47,338
that take was 10 billion.
In diamonds

45
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,708
And I...

46
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:57,287
And what did you do Daddy?
- I planted a mango tree

47
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:02,032
Drop mango. What about the diamonds?
- Don't. They will rot

48
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:06,111
Diamonds... rot...?
- Ass! Not diamonds. Mangoes

49
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,773
Unless you pluck mangoes in time.
- I'll have every tree plucked

50
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:16,435
What about the diamonds?
- Diamond! She was my best cow

51
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:25,509
Gave 10 liters of milk a day.
Any ox would die for her

52
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:32,127
Make sure you give her a memorial.
- Don't chew my brains

53
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:38,953
Reminds me of a great dish
your mother used to cook

54
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:44,157
"I could've chewed up her fingers,
that was when she fed me herself"

55
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:50,607
Diamonds! Worth 10 billion!
Where are they stashed?

56
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:57,602
Diamonds! Son! In the American bank.
Seventy five quid...

57
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:03,096
Diamonds worth seventy five quid...?
- I owe the laundry 75 quid

58
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,049
Make sure you get my loincloth.
- If you drop dead...

59
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,628
I'll spend the rest of my life in
a loincloth. Where are the diamonds?

60
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:18,456
Die... die...
- Diamonds... where...?

61
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,451
Dye my hair before my funeral.
I want to die young

62
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:29,239
Diamonds! Where are they?

63
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:57,000
I am reading out
the testament...

64
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:00,620
that Baba Baldev Prasad
wrote...

65
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:05,616
before his death.
It goes to say...

66
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,109
that he has bequeathed
his entire estate...

67
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:17,064
"in three equal parts,
to be distributed amongst..."

68
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:22,599
"his son Vikrant, his adopted daughter
Preeti and his son-in-law, Guru Gulab"

69
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:28,885
Diamonds worth 10 billion
lies deposited...

70
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:33,423
"in New York Bank,
New York City, in America"

71
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:38,084
The bank will release
the diamonds...

72
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,537
"only on personal signatures executed
by the three of you, in person"

73
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:46,574
"Should any of the three die,
two will sign"

74
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:50,613
And the death certificate of
the deceased is to be produced

75
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:59,937
"Should two of the three die,
2 death certificates may be produced"

76
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:07,181
"The third will sign. Should all die,
the diamonds will pass to Champaklal"

77
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:11,967
Who's this Champaklal?
I'm going to kill him right away

78
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:18,003
How can you? I am Champaklal.
Your advocate

79
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:22,956
Oh you are the one? Bloody lawyer!
This must be one of your ploys

80
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:27,161
What are you doing? At least hear out
one final point in the will

81
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:32,821
What final point?
- Should I be the first one to die...

82
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:38,773
no one gets anything. All the diamonds
go to a cattle-rearing trust

83
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:45,558
"No one gets anything, if I die.
Please think about it"

84
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:52,466
Let me know when I got to go
to America to retrieve the diamonds

85
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:56,421
I'll be there

86
00:17:56,422 --> 00:18:02,212
I'll send you...
to the land of no-return

87
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:12,823
Guru... Preeti speaking.
- Yes go on

88
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:17,818
Our marriage was a compromise
we went through quietly...

89
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:23,979
for the sake of Daddy's happiness.
Ever since the wedding...

90
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,889
we have never been together.
What husband-and-wife? We're strangers

91
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:35,466
"Now that Daddy is no more,
I want to put an end to this farce"

92
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:43,500
We ought to separate.
- I know why you want a divorce

93
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,787
A share in your father's diamonds
goes to his son-in-law. Which is me

94
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:53,158
"Divorced, I'm no longer your husband.
Nor your Daddy's son-in-law"

95
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:58,568
You and Vikrant will grab my diamonds.
- I'm not interested in diamonds at all

96
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:04,483
"Listen to me, Guru"

97
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:18,506
What a quandary you have left me in...
My step brother wants to grab my estate

98
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:26,665
And that Guru... he doesn't even know
that Vikrant is after his life

99
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:58,532
"Must be hiding inside!
Come on, in... quick"

100
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,481
Security has been tightened.
He cannot escape

101
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:16,304
Cell phone? Lighter? Loose change?
Anything on you...?

102
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:21,138
I'm asking you

103
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:05,926
Surrender

104
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:07,426
"Last night, Guru Gulab Khatri
shot the Home Minister dead"

105
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,334
The police has announced
a city-wide red alert

106
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:18,539
All roads leading out of the city
are sealed

107
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,161
"Check posts are up at railway stations,
bus stations, airports"

108
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:25,949
The whole city is being watched
by the police. The police claims...

109
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,488
that he will be taken dead or alive
in a matter of hours

110
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:39,375
Not hello

111
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:42,413
Get shocked

112
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:45,870
Shocked to hear Guru's voice?
You want to frame me?

113
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:50,364
You tried to kill Guru
for a handful of diamonds?

114
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:55,942
Now it's your funeral. Because
Guru knows where you are

115
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:04,146
You don't know
where I am

116
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:09,178
He escaped

117
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,759
"Sir, I told you before.
Crime never pays"

118
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,628
He isn't getting away.
I'll find him

119
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:24,376
"Someone, somewhere, sometime...
will surely give him away"

120
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:58,671
"Wayward, crazy, insane..."

121
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:01,459
your lover has become...

122
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:07,416
your eyes have ruined me

123
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:18,567
My love...

124
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:22,231
I give you my heart

125
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:24,252
You are my monsoon...

126
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:29,414
I pine for you...

127
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:37,488
to the depths of my soul

128
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:40,402
"I met you, I found out..."

129
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:43,315
I'm hopelessly in love...

130
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:47,187
your eyes have ruined me

131
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:26,482
All I got to tell you...

132
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:33,100
in your arms...

133
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:40,300
I want to stay

134
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:43,297
You mean everything to me...

135
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,252
I'm in love with you...

136
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:50,124
your eyes have ruined me

137
00:29:57,493 --> 00:30:03,319
My love...

138
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,274
my heart goes out to you

139
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:39,824
Twelve already?
- Do you find a clock in me?

140
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:43,820
"No darling, it's because you don't
get up before 12. So I thought it's 12"

141
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:52,729
You know Mummy screamed at me today.
- But we slept separate last night

142
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:59,514
You never told me you're sick.
- I'm not

143
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,509
Why didn't you dry last night's laundry?
- By the time I finished washing...

144
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:09,503
it was 2 a.m.
I don't know when I dozed off

145
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:12,790
"You made breakfast,
you broke teeth in the clinic..."

146
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,997
"you dusted the house, you did
the dishes, you washed the clothes..."

147
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:21,075
and you didn't doze off? You dozed off
just in time to dry the laundry?

148
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:25,696
Why didn't you keep your take from
the clinic yesterday under my pillow?

149
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:31,148
I completely forgot...

150
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:36,018
I don't know how I dozed off... I was
tired... I wanted to give you the money

151
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:48,964
I desperately need 20 dollars today.
- 20 dollars...?

152
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:53,834
"I'm only asking for twenty.
Not 20,000"

153
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:06,946
Asking for money from ladies up
in the morning spells bad luck for men

154
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,816
I just got to buy a new tie
and my spell of bad luck will be over

155
00:32:12,815 --> 00:32:17,602
What about the tie you took a year ago?
Did you have it for dinner?

156
00:32:18,725 --> 00:32:24,387
It's too dated to even look at

157
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:28,591
"For 25 years, your father-in-law wore
that tie. And he never said a word"

158
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:33,253
"After only a year,
it's dated for you?"

159
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:37,665
Next you'll find me and my mother
dated enough to be changed?

160
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:46,323
Biswajit... there you are

161
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:51,651
"Tell me, which one will you wear?
- Will he ever stop mixing up names?"

162
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:56,812
What are you doing with all those?
- You bought a score of them yesterday

163
00:32:57,313 --> 00:33:01,059
"I just want to know which one
you want me to iron, darling Biswajit"

164
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:04,305
Paramjit.
- Paramjit... who...?

165
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:10,008
"I'm Paramjit, the woman you married.
- Sona, tell your mother not to scream"

166
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,878
"Daddy, my name is Mona. Not Sona.
- That's the mess with these clothes"

167
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:19,291
"I even forgot her name, Parimal!
- I'm not Parimal. I'm Anmol"

168
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,287
What's wrong with you Chunilal?
- Manilal

169
00:33:23,744 --> 00:33:27,116
Who's Manilal?
- Your name is Manilal. Manilal Patel

170
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,404
When did I name myself that...?
- Ever since you were a kid

171
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:34,858
That's been my name ever since
I was a kid...? And you tell me now?

172
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:39,602
"Okay, I'll remember!
I'm Methilal"

173
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:43,474
Jesus? You just said I'm Methilal...?

174
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,510
"Make breakfast.
Or, I'll have you for breakfast"

175
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:51,176
Not today. Yesterday's scars haven't
healed yet. Come on brother-in-law

176
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:55,338
"Brother-in-law? I'm your son-in-law.
- At home, we're slaves anyway"

177
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:02,663
What have I gotten myself into for
a green card? Dicing green vegetables

178
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:07,742
"News from India. Guru Gulab Khatri,
the infamous mafia don..."

179
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,778
the assassin of the late home minister
is still at large

180
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,150
The assassin who specialized in killing
his quarry over a cup of coffee...

181
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:22,186
has fallen out
with rival don Vikrant

182
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:27,805
Unconfirmed sources say that
Vikrant has announced a reward...

183
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:33,424
of 20 million for news
of Guru Gulab Khatri

184
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:41,416
You heard that? A 20 million reward!
- Unless we hurry with the breakfast...

185
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:47,827
those two hoods will declare
a 2-dollar reward on our heads

186
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:51,697
"Hurry up, bring up the tea.
- Oh yes"

187
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:55,819
"Daddy, American chopsuey for me.
- I won't"

188
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:00,190
Why won't you?
- I want 50 dollars

189
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:05,227
We don't charge you for eating and
you want 50 dollars to cook for us?

190
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:11,970
I need it for buying grocery. Did I
ever want to get paid for cooking?

191
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:15,881
Last week I gave you 50 dollars.
You haven't yet settled the account

192
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:19,920
I will settle. Accounting isn't
as simple as eating. Takes thinking

193
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,332
"If there's a mess-up,
you'll be after my life"

194
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:28,494
Just let me have 50 dollars.
I'll settle the accounts later

195
00:35:30,742 --> 00:35:35,570
I must have the account tonight.
- Sure. I don't want to be kicked out

196
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:40,564
Come on Tol-Mol.
- Not Tol-Mol. Anmol

197
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:46,227
Come on son-in-law.
Don't you want to break some teeth?

198
00:35:52,262 --> 00:35:57,091
Why are you so glum?
- I chased happiness...

199
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,419
all the way to America.
And what I get is so much misery

200
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:08,954
I'm tired of this life of servitude.
- I understand everything

201
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:13,866
"All day in the clinic, scraping dollars
that I will give to my mother-in-law"

202
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:18,112
"And yet, a life worse than a slave?
I want to run away to India..."

203
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:23,439
"given once chance.
- Been looking for mine, for 25 years"

204
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:28,102
But Satyajit has my passport.
- Who's Satyajit?

205
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:33,055
"Your mother-in-law, my wife.
All my fault..."

206
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:36,884
"were it not for my marriage,
were it not for my daughter..."

207
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:40,297
"you'd never have been miserable.
Here, keep 20 dollars"

208
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,710
"20 dollars...?
- You wanted it, didn't you? Keep it"

209
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:48,123
But you...?
- I'll fudge up the accounts

210
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:53,076
"For every 20 minutes I spend shopping,
I take 3 hours writing the account"

211
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:57,447
"Don't forget the pants,
get yourself first class stuff"

212
00:37:37,365 --> 00:37:43,113
When do I get your appointment?

213
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:50,143
What are you doing?

214
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:53,556
How many times have I told you?
Read a book on dental surgery

215
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:57,345
But all you do is collect
photos of goons. Strange fancy

216
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:02,924
Not fancy. Passion. Obsession

217
00:38:03,464 --> 00:38:06,503
"Emotion, I'm in love, sir"

218
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:12,039
It was tough setting up the clinic.
Send the patients in

219
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:17,241
I got to leave early today

220
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:22,324
Today's a bad day

221
00:38:22,528 --> 00:38:26,691
My wife is a pain in my neck.
- Cut off the neck

222
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:30,269
What...?
- Get rid of your wife

223
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,558
Get rid...?
- Divorce her

224
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:36,764
She won't give me a divorce.
- Why not? She doesn't love you

225
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:39,677
"Won't even let you touch her,
so what's the marriage about?"

226
00:38:39,678 --> 00:38:44,673
"No servants in America.
And if they are, they charge lots"

227
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:53,498
Mona has even threatened me with
half suicide if I think of divorce

228
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:01,280
"If it takes 30 pills to kill someone,
she will take 15"

229
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:04,819
And she will write a note saying that
I drove her to suicide

230
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:09,564
"It won't kill her,
but it will kill me"

231
00:39:09,565 --> 00:39:14,393
You're worse than an ass that belongs
neither in India nor in America

232
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:17,723
Really... I wonder... how long...
my silly father-in-law and I...

233
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:21,012
will keep dangling from
the tail-ends of our respective wives

234
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:37,536
You don't hear?
No dumping garbage here

235
00:39:37,537 --> 00:39:43,448
Strange! No dumping! You don't get it?
I'm screaming myself hoarse

236
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:49,067
Have you sold your ears?
Hey! No dumping garbage here

237
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:53,479
"I'm being polite because you're new.
Hey flower-boy, what's your name?"

238
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:59,306
What kind of name is that?
No dumping here. You don't get it?

239
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,593
Sorry? You think this is India?
You can get away with a sorry?

240
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:06,756
What happened?
- For an hour I'm telling this moron...

241
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:11,628
Tell him to pick up
the garbage. Else...

242
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:19,161
Else... what?
- I'm warning you...

243
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:23,533
if I lose my head...
I'll give you a thrashing

244
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:32,482
"I see...?
- First you litter, then you see...?"

245
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:37,893
If I lose my head...
- I saw him on TV

246
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:41,638
Damn where you saw him!
If I lose my head...

247
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,635
He's the one with a 20 million reward.
He's a big underworld don from India

248
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:50,342
"Underworld, or underwear...
so what if he's a don?"

249
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,293
That Guru Gulab Khatri. The assassin
who kills over a cup of coffee

250
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,830
He's a don...?
- Yes

251
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:02,284
Big-time.
- Don...?

252
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:06,490
So what will you do
if you lose your head?

253
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:12,484
"I was saying, no sooner than
I lose my head, I also cool down"

254
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,270
"You're new here, no?
Got to tell you... as a neighbour"

255
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:22,307
Dump your garbage here. Go on.
Lovely site. Where else do you dump?

256
00:41:25,637 --> 00:41:32,505
"If there's ever a bad tooth, tell me.
- And I am... what's my name...?"

257
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:36,583
"In the heat of the moment,
I always forget names"

258
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:39,873
"Someone just asked me,
Manilal, where are you going?"

259
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:49,946
In that house over there...
I'm the housewife... house-husband

260
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:54,233
"Come over, anytime for tea.
- Come on, have coffee with me"

261
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:57,645
Come on.
- No... I got to do the chores

262
00:41:57,646 --> 00:42:00,976
"Come... keep the chores for later.
- I got to do the laundry, the dishes"

263
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:03,514
Then you come along.
- I got chores to do too!

264
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:04,597
Run!

265
00:42:04,598 --> 00:42:08,509
"Come on, somebody
have coffee with me"

266
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,755
Drape the windows black!
- Why are you screaming?

267
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:17,793
Use Ranjit's dress if you have to!
- I'm Paramjit. Not Ranjit

268
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:20,497
"Whoever you are,
he'll kill you"

269
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:25,827
Mona! Our neighbour is an Indian don
with a reward of 20 million on him

270
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:29,281
A 20 million reward?
Let me take a look at him

271
00:42:29,282 --> 00:42:32,569
He isn't advertising the reward
and I'm not going to let you go out

272
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:37,648
Mummy! Anmol won't let me take a look!
- You broke my daughter's heart again?

273
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:41,310
I did nothing...
- Go on and tell me if he's nice

274
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:46,972
He's a goon! He's going to kill you!
Don't you understand Karanjit?

275
00:42:47,513 --> 00:42:53,341
I'm Paramjit!
- Your name won't matter. A bullet will

276
00:42:53,882 --> 00:42:56,337
Shut the door.
- He's dangerous

277
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:59,625
There could be a shootout!
- What do we do now?

278
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:03,539
Let's pack for Mumbai!
- I'll do the packing

279
00:43:03,997 --> 00:43:08,118
"I'll buy tickets.
- Yes, right away"

280
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:13,782
Stop

281
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:18,149
No need to buy tickets.
- My word! How about flying for free?

282
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:22,478
"If the ticket-checker comes, we'll tip
him 5 dollars. Like we did in Rajkot"

283
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:28,596
No one is going anywhere

284
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:33,425
I've seen through your ploy!
How about using the ruse of a don...

285
00:43:33,884 --> 00:43:39,128
"to make a getaway?
- No! He's real, dangerous, deadly Don"

286
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:44,498
And I'm a deadly witch.
- That's beyond doubt

287
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:55,237
"Golden chance! Slipped out of our hands!
- The same hands, we shall use to cook"

288
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:04,228
"Come on, quick! To the police!
- Police... why?"

289
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:09,806
"I wrote out his letter, for the police.
Read. Is it proper English?"

290
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,760
What is this?
- About the don next door

291
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:18,588
And see the signature?
I have used a pseudonym. Ajit

292
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,710
Who's Ajit...?
- My wife

293
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:24,582
But...
- When the goons get to know...

294
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,830
"who wrote this letter,
they will kill them"

295
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:31,743
And then the police will kill
the goons. Two aces in one letter

296
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,572
Now quick! Kickstart it.
- This is a car

297
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:38,235
Then use your fingers.
- It needs a heave. Battery down

298
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:45,440
Would you like a lift?

299
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:50,723
We'll manage

300
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:55,635
"Come on, I'll give you a lift.
- Who needs lifts? We're on ground floor"

301
00:44:56,468 --> 00:44:58,590
"We'll manage.
- Oh yes, we will"

302
00:44:58,591 --> 00:45:02,211
"I mean, a lift in my car.
- No... we'll manage"

303
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:06,416
Just 15 miles. He walks 7.5.
I'll walk 7.5

304
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:09,746
Where are you headed?

305
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:14,953
Not to the police

306
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:26,104
Not police. Post office.
- Yes! Post office

307
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:29,600
Look! I got to post this letter.
Take care of it

308
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:34,638
No... you keep it. You're senior.
- You're junior. You keep it

309
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,341
I'll post it for you.
- No! Why take the trouble?

310
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:42,422
We'll post it.
- What's this enthusiasm about?

311
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,542
Something exciting in the letter?
- Nothing about you

312
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:50,539
Nothing special about you.
- Make sure you never write about me

313
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:55,742
I don't like being written
or read about. Get it?

314
00:45:56,658 --> 00:46:01,444
We don't even know you.
We don't even know you're from India

315
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:05,732
And he doesn't even know that
you're carrying a 20 million reward

316
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:10,351
You got any idea about that?
No you don't. There...

317
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:14,726
Come on

318
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:30,123
I don't like being subject of gossip.
Pisses me off

319
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:36,409
I bit the doctor who delivered me.
- Bit him? Why?

320
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:41,737
"He was screaming,
congratulations, you have a boy"

321
00:46:42,195 --> 00:46:48,400
As if it remained to be said.
So I bit him and he died

322
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:55,848
I don't bite anymore.
- How nice! Got the rage under control?

323
00:46:56,348 --> 00:47:00,427
"Age mellows, you know.
- Now my parrot bites"

324
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:05,755
Parrot?
- You got a parrot? We never saw

325
00:47:06,296 --> 00:47:12,081
I'll show you.
- Parrot in the pocket! Doesn't bite?

326
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,444
That's no parrot!
Someone fooled you!

327
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:31,936
That's a knife!
The kind you dice vegetables with

328
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:41,428
This is my talking parrot. It has
only to use it's beak on someone...

329
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:47,837
"to make you talk like a parrot.
- No, not me"

330
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:54,415
You look the innocent types.
So I'll give you 3 lifelines

331
00:47:55,372 --> 00:48:01,491
"Let's get this clear. Three mine
and three his... total of six, no?"

332
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:10,357
Get that? Total of three.
One and a half for each of us

333
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,255
"My smile's nice too.
- Come on, let's have coffee"

334
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:30,336
No! I'm fasting!
- I'm fasting too

335
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:35,376
Let's have a coffee

336
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:48,985
We're caught between
a stone and a hard place

337
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:54,229
Welcome home.
Back home?

338
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,393
"Are we in the wrong house?
- No, you've come to the right place"

339
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:02,013
"Mona, fetch cold water for Daddy.
- No! I use hot wash for the dishes"

340
00:49:02,514 --> 00:49:06,093
"Not for the dishes, for a drink.
How about a yoghurt shake?"

341
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:10,837
A picture of fidelity?
- You mean loyalty?

342
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:17,040
"Have dinner. You must be hungry?
- Famished! But first I cook, no?"

343
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:22,244
"If you let go of me, I'll cook.
- Dinner is ready"

344
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,611
What's this?

345
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:32,275
Darling! Have you married again?
You never even invited me...?

346
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:35,561
Now stop standing and staring
and come on and eat

347
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:39,227
There's the sweet you love.
- My sweet?

348
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:46,136
Don't you eat it!
They must be up to something

349
00:49:46,885 --> 00:49:50,257
"Darling, you dream of going
to India, don't you?"

350
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:56,084
Who's this darling?
How dare he steal my dream?

351
00:49:56,583 --> 00:50:00,496
I'm talking about you.
Here are your passports

352
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:02,328
Ours...?
- Yes

353
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:07,660
And air tickets

354
00:50:08,488 --> 00:50:13,607
Glory be to the Goddess!

355
00:50:13,608 --> 00:50:20,517
Bitch! Harlot!
- What are you saying?

356
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,472
That's what I thought you were.
For no reason

357
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:27,885
No one has ever given a divorce
so lovingly

358
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:31,506
"Once I'm rid of the cancer that's you,
when I walk a free man in India..."

359
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:35,462
"it's you I'm going to dream about.
Come on, let's go"

360
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:37,833
Stop

361
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:43,494
I'm not divorcing you. I'm only
sending you to India for 10 or 12 days

362
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:49,488
She's only letting us out on bail!
- Yes. And you'll return from India...

363
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:55,482
with that 20 million.
- You want a dowry? At this age?

364
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:00,768
Look at this

365
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,267
"That's the address here. I know,
I'll make sure..."

366
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,596
I never turn up here again
- Look behind

367
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:06,595
Where...?

368
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:12,178
Obverse.
- So say that

369
00:51:13,506 --> 00:51:17,501
That's Guru Gulab Khatri

370
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:22,831
"Yes, you will tell Vikrant in India
that he is our neighbour"

371
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,701
No! I'm not doing that!
- You must

372
00:51:26,702 --> 00:51:30,864
No! I'm not going to India!
- Then I'll send this photo to Vikrant

373
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:34,318
And I'll tell him that
you are hiding Guru Gulab

374
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,274
I don't want Guru Gulab to kill me.
- Then you got to India

375
00:51:37,275 --> 00:51:40,479
No! I'm not going to India!
- Then get ready to die

376
00:51:40,938 --> 00:51:44,018
Dusting in half an hour!
- Dishes in 15 minutes

377
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:47,597
Ten minutes for washing and ironing!
- Five minutes to cook dinner

378
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:51,802
Two minutes...
- One minute! I'm going to India

379
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:57,172
You're staying in
Room 502 in Hotel le Meridien

380
00:51:57,629 --> 00:52:03,043
Get ready to leave tomorrow morning

381
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,079
Going to India?
Then they've set you free?

382
00:52:07,535 --> 00:52:12,157
"No, I'm going on business.
- At least it's a holiday"

383
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:15,777
I hope it isn't forever.
- Don't worry doctor

384
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:19,482
"If God's sending you to India,
it must be for the better"

385
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,685
Listen... take care of the clinic
while I'm gone

386
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:30,512
Guru Gulab Khatri is reported
to have escaped from India

387
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,294
This is a photo of Guru Gulab Khatri
from the internet

388
00:52:40,295 --> 00:52:43,916
A dangerous mafia don
is lurking behind...

389
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:49,415
this handsome face and that
innocently alluring smile

390
00:54:35,262 --> 00:54:40,050
"It was in solitude on a wondrous day
that the beauty met a maverick..."

391
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:43,838
"and a strange throb
coursed their hearts"

392
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:06,272
I've sworn...

393
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:10,560
I'll love only you

394
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:14,390
I can't suppress my passion

395
00:55:15,098 --> 00:55:18,220
Come into my arms

396
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:23,797
I'm restless

397
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:28,084
Let this distance be no more

398
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:31,998
"Ever since I met you,
Cupid's arrow has pierced my heart"

399
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:37,201
"Life has become miserable,
I'm dying for you"

400
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:46,400
"It was in solitude on a wondrous day
that the beauty met a maverick..."

401
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,938
"and a strange throb
coursed their hearts"

402
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:27,276
"A strange thirst
throbs in my veins"

403
00:56:29,607 --> 00:56:36,933
"I'm caught in the spell
of a new restlessness"

404
00:56:38,348 --> 00:56:44,426
Your love drives me crazy

405
00:56:47,548 --> 00:56:52,418
"They're about to lose themselves
in love, they're crazed"

406
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,956
"Look at them, insane.
They are daydreaming"

407
00:58:06,385 --> 00:58:11,339
"My love, stop me"

408
00:58:15,376 --> 00:58:20,413
"I want to steal a few moments
from you"

409
00:58:24,242 --> 00:58:30,445
"In my tresses
let me hide you"

410
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:37,021
"Lost in love's fires
they drew close..."

411
00:58:37,562 --> 00:58:41,516
"and nothing in the world
could stop them"

412
00:59:03,703 --> 00:59:08,448
Let's take a wash before we go out
looking for the brotherhood of goons

413
00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:14,234
We aren't seeing any Vikrant.
- Who else gives us the reward?

414
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:20,145
"He will give us the reward,
but he will kill Guru Gulab Khatri"

415
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:27,887
"Is that the right thing to happen?
- No, but how do we face the wives?"

416
00:59:28,594 --> 00:59:32,799
I've worked it out. We'll tell them
that we never found Vikrant

417
00:59:36,212 --> 00:59:41,956
"Let's live it up for a week!
No washing, no doing the dishes"

418
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:46,575
Just order room service!
First class idea

419
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:52,319
For your innocent looks
you are very clever

420
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,275
Bill everything to the account

421
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:58,606
Where are the lights?
No lights in the hotel?

422
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,267
What's that?

423
01:00:03,268 --> 01:00:09,221
Mannequin...?
- But not unclothed

424
01:00:11,426 --> 01:00:14,465
A mannequin dressed like a smuggler?
I'm seeing one for the first time

425
01:00:15,547 --> 01:00:20,962
Gold... that looks real

426
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,269
What happened to him?

427
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,600
Arrived...?

428
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:47,681
Stammers.
- What did you say?

429
01:00:47,682 --> 01:00:50,846
"Nothing. Sorry, I think
we're in the wrong room"

430
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:57,048
You're in the right room.
- Then you are in the wrong room?

431
01:00:57,547 --> 01:01:01,002
"Go on, get going.
- I'm in the right room too"

432
01:01:01,502 --> 01:01:07,079
Then we're in the wrong hotel?
- Hey! Right hotel. No melodrama

433
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:12,491
"Stand right there.
- Strange! Right room, right hotel...?"

434
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:17,569
Are you staying with us?
But we paid for double occupancy

435
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,147
"So... why don't you pay us?
Indirect income, get it?"

436
01:01:22,606 --> 01:01:27,517
"We'll adjust. We booked first,
so we take the beds"

437
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:32,845
You can sleep on the floor.
Now let's transact

438
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:40,046
How about an advance?
- Shut up. Or you're done for

439
01:01:40,588 --> 01:01:45,666
Do you know who I am?
- You never told us

440
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:51,493
The biggest of dons in India
call me Little Umbrella

441
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:57,820
"Umbrella! That's what he sells!
We don't need umbrellas, big or small"

442
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,482
"Not the rainy season,
so we don't need umbrellas"

443
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:04,813
"If I buy an umbrella,
I got to account for it, you know?"

444
01:02:05,312 --> 01:02:11,973
Find someone else.
- Dimwit! I'm here to kidnap you

445
01:02:12,472 --> 01:02:15,385
Look Tarpaulin...
- Little Umbrella

446
01:02:15,386 --> 01:02:18,674
What's Little Umbrella?
- That's my name

447
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:21,838
So what?
- You called me Tarpaulin

448
01:02:22,295 --> 01:02:25,959
Why would I call you Tarpaulin?
- Because you thought that's my name

449
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:28,622
What should be your name?
- You just called me Tarpaulin

450
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:33,076
But you just said Little Umbrella.
- I said Tarpaulin because you said so

451
01:02:33,576 --> 01:02:37,072
But why should that make you
change your name? Stick to one

452
01:02:37,614 --> 01:02:41,359
"It's messy, you know Parasol?"

453
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,606
He drew this out of that!
- I'll use it to cut yours out

454
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:51,058
"If I lose my head,
I'll kill you! Move"

455
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,599
Where to...?
- To Crazy Brother

456
01:04:03,028 --> 01:04:08,943
See him? Crazy Brother!
- The one dancing with the sticks?

457
01:07:50,508 --> 01:07:55,088
Who are these samples?
- Imported samples

458
01:07:57,543 --> 01:08:00,581
"Here to see Vikrant?
- No, he's fibbing"

459
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:05,410
"But I'm lucky to have met you.
Come on, let's go"

460
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:09,405
Hey...

461
01:08:09,406 --> 01:08:13,112
You don't say no to Brother.
Or I'll skin you alive

462
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:17,314
And all you'll be left with is...
- What?

463
01:08:17,315 --> 01:08:23,102
What shrinks when skinned?
- Pencil

464
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:29,054
"No, the stuff you skin and you suck...
- Watermelon...?"

465
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:34,049
Shut up... the stuff
that's long on both ends...

466
01:08:34,547 --> 01:08:38,087
juices out of either end...
what do you call that...?

467
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:41,581
"Sugarcane...?
- Yes, sugarcane"

468
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:45,870
I'll skin you till you're
only left with so much

469
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:50,990
"He's absent-minded, just like you.
- I only forget names"

470
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:54,819
He forgets stupid things.
He says you're absent-minded

471
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:00,651
Shut up

472
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:06,933
Looks like I got to show you monkeys
what the cage is like. Come on

473
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:12,681
What...?
- Stop gaping and move

474
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:50,680
Take care of the parrots
while I look up Vikrant

475
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:10,576
"Lovely colour, no...?"

476
01:10:10,577 --> 01:10:12,949
No you don't piss in that.
It'll change the colour of the water

477
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:18,656
It's a swimming pool

478
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:14,100
Come. Vikrant wants to see you

479
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,218
Where did you guys see Guru?
- I can't remember

480
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:28,498
Do you guys know the punishment
for lying?

481
01:11:28,499 --> 01:11:31,453
"Why would we lie, Prashantbhai...?
- Quiet"

482
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:35,283
They won't open their mouths like this.
We need to put it in their mouth.

483
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:37,739
Now what's that...?
- Milk?

484
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,820
Not milk.
- So?

485
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:43,067
It turns red when it's heated up.
- A rod

486
01:11:43,068 --> 01:11:46,813
"Right, a rod.
The cold part, that is"

487
01:11:46,814 --> 01:11:50,226
Cold part? So why heat it up at all?

488
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:54,389
The cold part will remain inside.
How will you pull the hot part out?

489
01:11:56,596 --> 01:11:59,926
But how will you shove it in?
- Go and get it. Go on

490
01:12:01,633 --> 01:12:04,796
"Sure, I'll get it. Red hot...
- Hey, don't bother"

491
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:08,250
We'll tell you peda-bhai (sweetmeat).
- Not Peda. Call him Yeda (crazy one)

492
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:11,830
"Actually, he came to live
in the neighborhood"

493
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:14,702
"The first time he got into a brawl..."

494
01:12:14,703 --> 01:12:18,282
I understood he was
an outliner like you

495
01:12:18,574 --> 01:12:21,612
"You call us "outliners?"
"- Not you..."

496
01:12:21,613 --> 01:12:25,066
"I'm talking about him, battery.
- Call me Umbrella!"

497
01:12:25,067 --> 01:12:28,605
"This guy's going to run out
the batteries in my mind"!"

498
01:12:28,606 --> 01:12:31,851
"Crazy, what proof that these monkeys
are speaking the truth?"

499
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:35,265
"Solid proof, actually.
His name is Ramu Raghavan"

500
01:12:35,682 --> 01:12:39,385
"And here... on the back of his neck,
he has a tattoo of a rose"

501
01:12:39,386 --> 01:12:40,634
What name?

502
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:44,298
"Try to figure out the name,
and you'll forget yours"

503
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:47,918
But he's speaking the truth.
Guru does have a tattoo

504
01:12:47,919 --> 01:12:52,335
Sister...

505
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:10,234
The two of them have
seen your husband. In America

506
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:15,308
Why've you run out of steam?
- It's nothing

507
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:20,303
"Yeda, take them both to America.
- And kill Guru there?"

508
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:27,588
"Just keep 20 million rupees ready.
- No, you'll only track him down..."

509
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,458
and inform me.
When I come over...

510
01:13:33,165 --> 01:13:37,453
you'll kill him in my presence.
The moment I receive his body...

511
01:13:37,953 --> 01:13:42,281
you'll have your money.
- Once Crazy gives his word...

512
01:13:42,864 --> 01:13:46,611
you could say he's lost his... what?
- Finger

513
01:13:47,027 --> 01:13:49,482
Not finger. It's...?
- Hair?

514
01:13:49,483 --> 01:13:51,729
"Not hair. Name the word,
or I'll slit your throat"

515
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,936
"The throat!
- Yes, throat"

516
01:13:53,937 --> 01:13:57,475
"Once I give my word,
be sure Guru has a slit throat"

517
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:02,428
Throats will be slit all the time.
But how are we spending our lives?

518
01:14:02,928 --> 01:14:09,258
"What happens of the reward
we ought to get, Sankrant?"

519
01:14:16,872 --> 01:14:21,246
Laugh

520
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:35,315
Come on

521
01:14:37,893 --> 01:14:40,764
"Daddy, listen to me...
Listen!"

522
01:14:40,765 --> 01:14:43,969
I don't think we're
getting a penny from them!

523
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,300
Didn't you see how
they laughed at us?

524
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:49,588
Let's pack our bags and take
the first flight back to America

525
01:14:49,589 --> 01:14:52,919
"No way. If we return empty-handed,
our wives will kill us"

526
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,832
We'd rather die at our wives' hands
than die here

527
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:59,496
Oh yes. The two of them
will at least be hanged

528
01:15:00,703 --> 01:15:06,156
"Pigeons, what've you been whispering?
- We were only waiting for you"

529
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:12,857
"The name is Umbrella, what?"

530
01:15:12,858 --> 01:15:16,438
"Call me the wrong name, and I'll
drive this knife into your head!"

531
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:23,181
"Smart-ass, go to the room and...
- Chain? You find those in trains"

532
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:28,092
Take a blanket and go to sleep!
- That's how we sleep. Come

533
01:15:28,467 --> 01:15:32,713
Where are you going?
You go there... and you go here

534
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,876
To the bathroom? There are mosquitoes
there. How will I sleep in there?

535
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:42,411
"Stop raising questions,
bloody mosquito repellent!"

536
01:15:43,161 --> 01:15:46,449
"Till we fly for America,
you're staying with me"

537
01:15:46,866 --> 01:15:49,695
So he doesn't fly away. Get that?

538
01:15:49,696 --> 01:15:55,605
Skip the drama. Move!
- Let's go

539
01:15:55,606 --> 01:15:59,935
"Every night, do you...?"

540
01:15:59,936 --> 01:16:02,015
Not in the nude. I sleep
with my clothes on

541
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:05,097
Not nude! Do you bathe?
- Twice

542
01:16:05,513 --> 01:16:09,717
"But I bathe in the nude, Vinodbhai."

543
01:16:09,718 --> 01:16:14,545
I've got so much to do! I've got
to bump off Khatri in America!

544
01:16:14,546 --> 01:16:20,918
Don't drive me out of my mind!

545
01:16:29,614 --> 01:16:32,527
Guruji? Bhaiji? Gulabji...
- Go on

546
01:16:32,528 --> 01:16:35,191
"Guru, there's life to your danger"

547
01:16:35,192 --> 01:16:38,105
"Go someplace far away,
so no one gets to know"

548
01:16:38,106 --> 01:16:40,935
"Whether someone gets to know or not,
I know everything"

549
01:16:40,936 --> 01:16:45,224
You're at the le Meridien hotel
in Mumbai right now. In room 502

550
01:16:46,514 --> 01:16:50,550
How did you get to know?

551
01:16:50,551 --> 01:16:54,173
I know about everything
you're doing in Mumbai

552
01:16:55,546 --> 01:16:59,043
But just remember.
Your second lifeline has run out too

553
01:17:03,913 --> 01:17:07,034
What tension he gave me!
What am I going to do?

554
01:17:07,035 --> 01:17:10,863
"Give me an idea, God...
Let the bell ring!"

555
01:17:10,864 --> 01:17:15,572
God...?

556
01:17:24,559 --> 01:17:27,555
You...? Here?

557
01:17:27,556 --> 01:17:31,885
Now don't misunderstand me...
I didn't want your husband caught

558
01:17:32,384 --> 01:17:35,922
The way the gangsters behave...
I just don't like it

559
01:17:35,923 --> 01:17:38,586
I had to come here because of Mona
- Mona?

560
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,875
My wife. Unfortunately!

561
01:17:40,876 --> 01:17:44,414
"She loves money, not me. She wants
the 100 million reward. Not me"

562
01:17:44,872 --> 01:17:48,410
"I'm just a dentist. You can ask my
father-in-law, if you don't believe me"

563
01:17:48,744 --> 01:17:50,865
I hate bloodshed...

564
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:55,360
I'm telling you the truth

565
01:17:55,361 --> 01:17:59,523
I want to go far away
from this bloodshed too

566
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:01,937
I have something to say to you.

567
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:04,976
It's this inheritance that has
bound us all together

568
01:18:04,977 --> 01:18:08,515
Father distributed the diamonds
worth 10 billion in such a manner...

569
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:14,508
that it turned Guru and Vikrant
into bitter enemies

570
01:18:14,509 --> 01:18:17,006
I begin to understand

571
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:20,335
I want you to make my husband
see reason

572
01:18:20,336 --> 01:18:24,416
"Neither do I want him killed,
nor am I on Vikrant's side"

573
01:18:25,749 --> 01:18:30,325
I'm even willing to give him
my share of the diamonds

574
01:18:30,326 --> 01:18:33,197
I only want him to
give me back my life

575
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:35,529
What does that mean?
- I want a divorce

576
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:38,609
You want a divorce too?

577
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,815
So do I

578
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:43,979
It's five months since
we were married...

579
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,350
and we haven't spent a moment together
in these five months

580
01:18:47,351 --> 01:18:51,097
"He never ever loved me,
nor did I love him"

581
01:18:52,804 --> 01:18:56,591
He was only waiting
for daddy to die...

582
01:18:56,592 --> 01:19:02,298
so he could swallow his wealth

583
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:08,455
You're so innocent
and beautiful

584
01:19:18,612 --> 01:19:24,692
Nobody ever said that to me

585
01:20:17,386 --> 01:20:20,881
Open the door! Hurry
- Chhota Chattri!

586
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:24,545
Open the door!
- What am I going to do?

587
01:20:24,546 --> 01:20:27,667
"Open the door, I say!
- In the bathroom..."

588
01:20:27,668 --> 01:20:30,705
"No, under the bed!
- Are you dead already?"

589
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:34,992
There's no room here.
- Behind the curtains. Quick!

590
01:20:34,993 --> 01:20:40,992
I'll break down this door!

591
01:20:41,446 --> 01:20:45,484
Tomcat! Is that how you sleep?
- What are you doing here?

592
01:20:47,023 --> 01:20:51,478
I've been knocking on the door.
And they wouldn't let me get in

593
01:20:51,976 --> 01:20:55,474
Where were you? Where...?
- In the bathroom

594
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:59,511
But the bathroom's on that side.
- I can even see it in the mirror

595
01:20:59,843 --> 01:21:03,173
Mirror? You look in the mirror
when you pee?

596
01:21:03,174 --> 01:21:06,504
Don't drive me crazy!
And pack your bags

597
01:21:06,836 --> 01:21:10,040
"We're taking the flight, no?
Get on with the packing"

598
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:16,372
Or I'll open you up and
you'll forget the bathroom

599
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:22,986
Where's this scent coming from?

600
01:21:22,987 --> 01:21:25,650
I don't get any scent

601
01:21:25,651 --> 01:21:28,647
I can smell a perfume!
A ladies' perfume

602
01:21:28,648 --> 01:21:32,060
Was a woman here?
- I used the perfume

603
01:21:32,061 --> 01:21:35,474
You...?
- Yes

604
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:38,928
Here... smell this.
- Lay off!

605
01:21:38,929 --> 01:21:44,302
"Don't get close, buster"

606
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:53,955
Whose is this?

607
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:58,077
Mine. I wear it in bed every night.
This is what I was looking for

608
01:21:58,369 --> 01:22:02,613
In the bathroom.
- Really?

609
01:22:02,614 --> 01:22:06,734
"Don't you want to wear anklets too?
- What a thing to say. Come, sit..."

610
01:22:07,026 --> 01:22:12,271
Lay off! You appear
a doubtful case to me

611
01:22:12,604 --> 01:22:18,597
Now pack your stuff. Move!

612
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:23,972
In a moment

613
01:22:25,342 --> 01:22:27,837
How will I tell you?
- What?

614
01:22:27,838 --> 01:22:33,962
"Till yesterday, I had
no purpose for being in India"

615
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,786
No cause.
- What does that mean?

616
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:41,783
"I mean, after spending
some moments with you..."

617
01:22:42,573 --> 01:22:44,904
I have not only found a
purpose for being here...

618
01:22:44,905 --> 01:22:49,485
but also a reason to live.
- What nonsense are you talking?

619
01:22:49,816 --> 01:22:54,811
"Whatever happens, I'll even lay down
my life to return your happiness to you"

620
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:59,390
I'm not leaving you now.
- Shut up!

621
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,553
I'll cherish your memories
in my heart

622
01:23:01,554 --> 01:23:04,219
What for?
- Till you belong to me...

623
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:07,216
I can have no peace.
- Step on the brakes!

624
01:23:07,217 --> 01:23:10,463
Your end is here!
Faggot!

625
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:16,580
"Watch your tongue, or I'll
shove this knife into your..."

626
01:23:16,581 --> 01:23:19,953
You're still stuck on that?
- And kill you!

627
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:23,573
Always end your line

628
01:23:23,574 --> 01:23:25,821
Are you guys father-in-law
and son-in-law?

629
01:23:25,822 --> 01:23:29,985
"You have doubts, Damodar?
- Watch it, rat!"

630
01:23:30,942 --> 01:23:34,980
You take me for a gay?
They call me Chhota Chattri

631
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:41,889
"The two of you are suspicious guys!
Father-in-law and son-in-law, eh?"

632
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,845
I understand everything!

633
01:23:43,846 --> 01:23:47,591
Pack the aircraft. We've got to
travel in the stuff

634
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:53,340
We're flying!

635
01:24:08,529 --> 01:24:11,817
Here we are. In Singapore.
- Singapore?

636
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:14,647
"We were going to America, weren't we?
What have you been up to?"

637
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:19,476
"This is America, all right.
- Just clearing my doubts, you see"

638
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,974
This is the first time
I've ventured outside Mumbai

639
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:24,804
Not Mumbai. Say outside the country.

640
01:24:24,805 --> 01:24:28,176
That's just what I thought.
We're outside something!

641
01:24:28,177 --> 01:24:32,504
Anna...

642
01:24:32,505 --> 01:24:35,919
I've made a grave mistake.
- What mistake?

643
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:40,747
I know. Mistake.
What mistake?

644
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:45,202
I called Guru Gulab Khatri
from Mumbai...

645
01:24:45,617 --> 01:24:48,405
and told him that I've revealed
his whereabouts to Vikrant

646
01:24:48,406 --> 01:24:51,820
What...? Have you gone mad?
- Let him go!

647
01:24:52,195 --> 01:24:55,774
He's not mad. You're mad!
- You call Anna mad?

648
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:59,311
"I was very scared, so I told
Guru Gulab Khatri the whole truth"

649
01:24:59,312 --> 01:25:01,850
Nice thing too.
He's going to finish you now

650
01:25:01,851 --> 01:25:06,763
"Vipul, you've ruined everything!
- You're going to die first..."

651
01:25:07,055 --> 01:25:10,549
"and then, you.
- Me too?"

652
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:14,048
"I have a wife and a daughter!
Find a way, Teda-bhai..."

653
01:25:14,421 --> 01:25:19,624
Not Teda-bhai.
My boss's name is...

654
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:22,704
Tell me tomorrow.
I'm in a hurry today

655
01:25:22,705 --> 01:25:24,577
"Find a way, please"

656
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:27,076
I suggest we go and hide under
the bed at home. What say?

657
01:25:27,077 --> 01:25:30,738
Guru Gulab will get there
before you can do that

658
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:33,319
There's just one way
of saving your lives

659
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,233
We won't go to your place.
We'll go elsewhere

660
01:25:37,523 --> 01:25:38,563
Where?

661
01:25:38,564 --> 01:25:41,894
Isn't Anna coming with us?
- He's gone to fetch something

662
01:25:41,895 --> 01:25:43,683
So he's coming here on a horse?

663
01:25:43,684 --> 01:25:46,765
Why did you have to play
the honest man?

664
01:25:47,555 --> 01:25:49,552
D'you know what a dangerous man
Guru is?

665
01:25:49,553 --> 01:25:52,967
It's so dark in here...
Where have you brought us?

666
01:25:54,299 --> 01:25:56,837
"We're not at the movies, are we?"

667
01:25:56,838 --> 01:25:59,375
"I'll switch on the light.
Where's the switch, Chattri?"

668
01:25:59,376 --> 01:26:04,206
"As if I come here every other day!
- Look for the switch, guys..."

669
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:12,405
"Gotcha! It's made of rubber, is it?
- Moron! It's my nose"

670
01:26:24,602 --> 01:26:28,430
The father-in-law
son-in-law duo

671
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:30,887
You're back after giving Vikrant
a contract to kill me?

672
01:26:30,888 --> 01:26:34,217
"Please understand, my brother...
we have made a mistake!"

673
01:26:34,592 --> 01:26:38,629
"Forgive us, Guru. We went astray.
- Our wives forced us into it"

674
01:26:39,005 --> 01:26:43,167
I don't have the time today.
But when I tell you my sad story...

675
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:49,122
you'll have tears in your eyes

676
01:26:49,244 --> 01:26:52,531
Run!

677
01:26:52,532 --> 01:26:58,155
The devil and the deep blue seas!

678
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:21,128
"Anna, watch the gun"

679
01:27:21,129 --> 01:27:26,543
Don't shoot

680
01:27:39,027 --> 01:27:44,941
"Scared you, didn't we?"

681
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:51,223
Look at their faces!
- You guys are friends?

682
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:54,428
They turn out to be buddies

683
01:27:55,011 --> 01:27:59,674
Vikrant offered me 20 million
to finish Guru

684
01:28:00,589 --> 01:28:06,541
And Guru has offered me 50 million
to finish Vikrant

685
01:28:08,581 --> 01:28:13,826
"So, we're getting together to
wait for him. Let Vikrant arrive"

686
01:28:14,533 --> 01:28:20,198
Brilliant!

687
01:28:39,258 --> 01:28:44,632
"Call for you, sir"

688
01:28:45,835 --> 01:28:48,540
Why're you yelling?
I can hear you

689
01:28:48,541 --> 01:28:50,788
Yeda Anna here.
- Speak

690
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:53,619
What the jokers said
turned out to be true

691
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:56,866
Guru really lives
in their neighborhood

692
01:28:57,365 --> 01:29:00,529
Catch that and come over.
- Catch what and come over?

693
01:29:00,738 --> 01:29:03,525
That...

694
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:06,314
How will I know if you
make signs over the phone?

695
01:29:06,315 --> 01:29:09,519
"One moment, sir"

696
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,641
What's that thing called
which flies in the air?

697
01:29:12,642 --> 01:29:15,513
"One moment, sir.
- Crow"

698
01:29:15,514 --> 01:29:19,843
Not crow. It flies in the air.
We fly it

699
01:29:22,091 --> 01:29:24,920
Kite?
- Not kite...

700
01:29:24,921 --> 01:29:29,207
it's what we sit in and fly

701
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:33,829
Catch a plane and come over
- Did you think I'd walk to America?

702
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,616
Hang up now. I'll come
and explain the plan to you

703
01:29:37,617 --> 01:29:41,778
"All right, sir"

704
01:29:41,779 --> 01:29:45,983
Didn't I tell you? Someone or the
other would surely lead us to Guru

705
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,647
He's in America.
- In America. What's he doing there?

706
01:29:52,686 --> 01:29:58,225
He must be dancing and singing
as usual

707
01:31:52,024 --> 01:31:56,561
"O beloved...
where are you?"

708
01:32:11,213 --> 01:32:14,501
"O beloved...
where are you?"

709
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:19,496
"She steals my heart,
takes me for her own..."

710
01:32:20,204 --> 01:32:26,618
"my beloved has left
with my heart"

711
01:32:31,277 --> 01:32:35,188
You suddenly appear before me...

712
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:38,561
and set my heart racing

713
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:42,598
You look at me;
You look away

714
01:32:43,306 --> 01:32:49,678
"You smile...
God Almighty!"

715
01:33:20,103 --> 01:33:23,723
You are a golden beauty

716
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:27,428
"You are intoxicating
all the way, my love"

717
01:33:28,011 --> 01:33:31,424
"The spell you cast,
the magic you wield..."

718
01:33:31,924 --> 01:33:38,380
"has this crazy man
bowled over by you"

719
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:44,285
Your eyes...

720
01:33:44,286 --> 01:33:49,660
they steal my heart

721
01:34:30,407 --> 01:34:34,194
Vikrant is bound to come

722
01:34:34,195 --> 01:34:37,691
He's going to be ferreted out
to be killed like a rat

723
01:34:37,692 --> 01:34:40,897
"May I say something, Gurubhai?
- What just something?"

724
01:34:41,354 --> 01:34:44,435
Say a lot of things.
Talk as much as you wish to

725
01:34:46,683 --> 01:34:51,595
"Actually, I met your wife in Mumbai.
She's very sweet"

726
01:34:54,175 --> 01:34:57,296
"I mean, she's very sweet-natured"

727
01:34:57,297 --> 01:35:01,167
She has sent a message for you

728
01:35:01,168 --> 01:35:04,164
What message?

729
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:08,036
She had no hand in whatever
Vikrant did to you in Mumbai

730
01:35:09,493 --> 01:35:13,822
According to your father-in-law's
and Preeti's father's will...

731
01:35:14,196 --> 01:35:18,233
the diamonds worth 2 billion...

732
01:35:18,234 --> 01:35:21,647
"which you, Vikrant and Preeti
are going to inherit..."

733
01:35:21,648 --> 01:35:24,227
she has absolutely no interest in it

734
01:35:24,228 --> 01:35:27,641
All she wants from you
is a divorce

735
01:35:27,642 --> 01:35:30,764
"She told me that if
you gave her a divorce..."

736
01:35:31,013 --> 01:35:34,800
she'd give you her share
of the diamonds...

737
01:35:34,801 --> 01:35:36,716
"Don't take up for my wife, okay?"

738
01:35:36,717 --> 01:35:39,212
"Neither am I giving her a divorce,
nor am I leaving her"

739
01:35:39,213 --> 01:35:41,293
And don't you dare meddle
in my personal matters.

740
01:35:41,294 --> 01:35:44,207
Or I'll bury you right here.
- Forget it

741
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:48,121
Let's go to your house and
discuss important matters

742
01:35:48,371 --> 01:35:51,283
"No, you guys can't stay at my place.
- Why not?"

743
01:35:51,284 --> 01:35:54,699
Vikrant is not to be trusted.
He must've set dogs on your trail

744
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,277
He'll get to know that
we're into this together

745
01:35:57,278 --> 01:36:00,774
So where are we going to stay?
On the pavements in America?

746
01:36:00,775 --> 01:36:04,397
Go and stay at their place.
- My house. Get that?

747
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:09,558
Where do you guys stay?
- Bang opposite Shani's house

748
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:13,136
Not Shani. It's Guru.
And where does Guru stay?

749
01:36:13,137 --> 01:36:16,342
He stays in front of our house

750
01:36:16,343 --> 01:36:19,214
So where do you guys live?

751
01:36:19,215 --> 01:36:22,127
We live in opposite houses. Why?

752
01:36:22,128 --> 01:36:26,083
I'll straighten him out.
- Sit down. He's mad anyway

753
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:30,037
"We don't know the cops here.
Else, I'd have give it to him"

754
01:36:38,112 --> 01:36:43,194
I'm back in hell!

755
01:36:45,356 --> 01:36:47,893
"It's amazing, isn't it?"

756
01:36:47,894 --> 01:36:52,098
You finish it before I do?
I said it's fantastic!

757
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:56,178
"You'll discover it for what it is,
only when you step in"

758
01:36:56,553 --> 01:36:59,634
What?
- That's a brawl in Gujarati

759
01:37:00,007 --> 01:37:02,213
Don't you have any servants
to carry our luggage?

760
01:37:02,214 --> 01:37:04,959
"We're here, aren't we?
This is our duty"

761
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,416
I'm Coolie No. 1 and he's
Coolie No 2

762
01:37:07,417 --> 01:37:11,121
"Spring to the task, son-in-law.
And get ready to play the game"

763
01:37:13,203 --> 01:37:16,282
Here come our millionaires!
- Hurry up...

764
01:37:16,283 --> 01:37:18,447
and grab the money from them!

765
01:37:18,448 --> 01:37:20,694
Come on in. Come...

766
01:37:20,695 --> 01:37:24,108
The most horrifying place on earth.
Our house

767
01:37:24,609 --> 01:37:27,354
And over there is our room

768
01:37:27,355 --> 01:37:30,893
"That kitchen?
- Yes, that's where we always are"

769
01:37:33,057 --> 01:37:36,513
And that's the bathroom.
With running hot and cold water

770
01:37:37,304 --> 01:37:40,508
"Go ahead and do your laundry,
if you have any"

771
01:37:40,509 --> 01:37:43,464
Wait there!

772
01:37:43,465 --> 01:37:46,503
What's happening here?
What beggars have you brought home?

773
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:50,747
"Don't worry, this is a daily affair.
She doesn't know, you see"

774
01:37:50,748 --> 01:37:53,911
They're my friends.
They've just arrived from India

775
01:37:54,412 --> 01:37:58,781
Now what is your name...?
- Chhota Chattri and Yeda Anna

776
01:37:59,282 --> 01:38:01,819
They'll stay with us for some days.
- Why will they?

777
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:05,484
"This is no lodge, is it?
It's enough that we let you live here"

778
01:38:06,024 --> 01:38:09,146
"Go on now. Get out
- Listen to me, darling..."

779
01:38:09,147 --> 01:38:11,227
Have I ever listened to you?

780
01:38:11,228 --> 01:38:13,517
No.
- So why must I now?

781
01:38:13,518 --> 01:38:15,557
Right.
- Get going then...

782
01:38:15,558 --> 01:38:18,470
pick up your bags and get lost

783
01:38:18,471 --> 01:38:23,215
Will you leave or must
I throw you out?

784
01:38:23,216 --> 01:38:26,546
Don't you spit here!

785
01:38:26,547 --> 01:38:28,709
He's not spitting.
The poor guy has a stammer

786
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:31,207
And this dumb guy
talks in sign-language

787
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:33,954
So why must you bring the
deaf and the dumb to this place?

788
01:38:33,955 --> 01:38:39,282
Go and admit them to a hospital!
Get going!

789
01:38:39,283 --> 01:38:45,072
Right now! Get out...

790
01:38:46,276 --> 01:38:48,814
You've been shooting your mouth off!

791
01:38:48,815 --> 01:38:52,436
"Will you carry on,
only because I'm quiet?"

792
01:38:52,437 --> 01:38:56,432
Out of my way!
Let the breeze through

793
01:38:56,433 --> 01:38:58,596
You shut up!

794
01:38:58,597 --> 01:39:02,052
Don't you dare yell
at Chhota Chattri

795
01:39:04,467 --> 01:39:07,754
How dare you talk like this
with my mummy?

796
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:17,496
"Madam, enough of your chatter.
Or else, that thing in your head..."

797
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:20,865
what is it called?
- Brains

798
01:39:20,866 --> 01:39:23,405
Women don't have brains
in any case

799
01:39:23,406 --> 01:39:28,109
What's that thing in the head
the Lord once tamed...?

800
01:39:30,024 --> 01:39:32,146
Arrogance?
- Arrogance

801
01:39:32,147 --> 01:39:35,518
I'll rid you of it in a second.
What are you staring at?

802
01:39:35,935 --> 01:39:40,763
We're going to take a bath.
We want hot tea before that. Okay?

803
01:39:41,929 --> 01:39:47,343
Let's go

804
01:40:05,448 --> 01:40:11,565
Guru and Vikrant are playing
with diamonds worth billions

805
01:40:12,191 --> 01:40:15,561
And we're going to
get just 50 million?

806
01:40:15,978 --> 01:40:21,680
The promise I've made to Guru
is final

807
01:40:22,637 --> 01:40:25,759
I'm not interested in those diamonds
worth billions

808
01:40:26,343 --> 01:40:30,005
"Fantastic! Fantastic, Anna!"

809
01:40:30,006 --> 01:40:32,668
You're a man of your word!

810
01:40:32,669 --> 01:40:35,790
I get to learn so much from you today

811
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:41,910
I'd make a bonfire for what you said!
Fantastic!

812
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,816
I'm not interested in those
diamonds worth billions

813
01:40:53,648 --> 01:40:56,895
It's just that the crazy one
is interested in them

814
01:40:59,352 --> 01:41:02,556
Try some laddoos.
We made them

815
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:07,218
And tell us quickly where
the 20 million is

816
01:41:07,219 --> 01:41:10,630
"Actually, Mona..."

817
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:13,378
"First eat the laddoos, okay?"

818
01:41:13,379 --> 01:41:16,749
"Let me tell her, or she'll pull out
the laddoo from my mouth"

819
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:22,955
Nothing's going to happen.
Just eat it up

820
01:41:25,284 --> 01:41:28,654
I didn't know you made
such excellent laddoos!

821
01:41:28,655 --> 01:41:31,735
Forget the laddoos.
Let's talk about the millions

822
01:41:33,276 --> 01:41:37,688
"Mummy, forget 10 million, we haven't
even got a single rupee"

823
01:41:38,271 --> 01:41:41,808
What...?

824
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:45,181
We are trapped because we tipped
him off about Guru Gulab Khatri

825
01:41:47,262 --> 01:41:49,800
Yeda Anna's going to get
the entire reward

826
01:41:49,801 --> 01:41:52,839
What? The two of them are
going to get the reward?

827
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:00,248
The two of them are going
to get the money

828
01:42:00,249 --> 01:42:02,205
We're happy to have the laddoos

829
01:42:02,206 --> 01:42:05,408
Don't you touch the laddoos!
Keep it back in the plate

830
01:42:05,409 --> 01:42:08,490
And go and prepare breakfast
for the guests. Go into the kitchen

831
01:42:09,115 --> 01:42:11,945
I told you to tell them
after we had eaten the laddoos

832
01:42:11,946 --> 01:42:14,068
But you had to tell him first.
- We spent so much...

833
01:42:14,069 --> 01:42:19,021
"to send them to India,
and they achieve nothing!"

834
01:42:19,022 --> 01:42:22,893
"Baby, we have guests at home.
You will look after them won't you?"

835
01:42:24,933 --> 01:42:30,347
As if you need to ask

836
01:42:36,254 --> 01:42:40,957
"What happened, doctor?"

837
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:43,370
So what's all this about?

838
01:42:43,371 --> 01:42:46,868
"What will I tell you, Tina?
I'm going out of my mind"

839
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:48,949
Ever since underworld don
Guru Gulab Khatri has...

840
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:51,280
come to live in the neighborhood...
- What?

841
01:42:51,281 --> 01:42:55,318
The underworld don! Guru Gulab Khatri
came to live in your neighborhood?

842
01:42:57,026 --> 01:43:03,481
"I didn't speak in Hebrew, did I?
- And you tell me about it today?"

843
01:43:05,184 --> 01:43:10,723
"Hurry!
- Listen, Tina..."

844
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:25,454
Do you take this for
a charitable home?

845
01:43:25,455 --> 01:43:27,869
You see a doorbell
and start ringing it?

846
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:29,992
Who's going to pay the
electricity bills?

847
01:43:29,993 --> 01:43:35,610
"No, I brought someone to meet you"

848
01:43:35,611 --> 01:43:39,566
"Are you a doctor, or a pimp?
You mustn't do such things, son"

849
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:45,688
"Get that? Go on now.
Get lost, scram"

850
01:43:47,307 --> 01:43:50,595
What happened?

851
01:43:50,596 --> 01:43:54,926
"I'm here to meet you, buddy...
not to bump you off"

852
01:43:56,298 --> 01:43:58,546
Who's this fast number?

853
01:43:58,547 --> 01:44:00,836
She's my secretary and...

854
01:44:00,837 --> 01:44:06,831
I know. Aged ten.
- Ten years? He doesn't look ten

855
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:11,034
"At ten, he used to play the
harmonium in a train. Right?"

856
01:44:12,282 --> 01:44:14,780
He was a beggar then?

857
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:17,318
He has made all this
out of his alms!

858
01:44:17,319 --> 01:44:21,231
Which train was it?

859
01:44:21,232 --> 01:44:24,437
"In the harmonium,
he used to smuggle liquor"

860
01:44:25,228 --> 01:44:29,640
"From Mumbai to Gujarat,
from Gujarat to Mumbai"

861
01:44:29,641 --> 01:44:32,929
Serving a two-year sentence
at the Arthur Road jail...

862
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:35,592
he held the jailer's gun to his temple
on the pretext of polishing his shoes...

863
01:44:35,593 --> 01:44:39,213
and escaped in two months.
Salim Talwar of Bhendi Bazar

864
01:44:39,214 --> 01:44:45,125
He brandished a harmless knife at him
and sent him out of limits

865
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:49,662
She talks too much.
Meena's going to explode

866
01:44:49,663 --> 01:44:52,617
"Tina, who?
- My secretary, Tina"

867
01:44:52,618 --> 01:44:54,948
What is it with her?

868
01:44:54,949 --> 01:44:57,278
Don of Radha Galli.
Babu Batli

869
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:00,026
"You made him run along the lake,
in broad daylight..."

870
01:45:00,027 --> 01:45:03,356
with not a shred of clothing...
- Wrong. He was wearing shoes

871
01:45:03,357 --> 01:45:08,267
Yes. And you soon became
the don of that area

872
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:12,057
Who are you? Where are you from?
Come on inside

873
01:45:14,138 --> 01:45:16,426
You have my bio-data
printed on your mind

874
01:45:16,427 --> 01:45:21,171
"You're a dangerous girl, I swear.
Here's a token of our friendship"

875
01:45:21,172 --> 01:45:26,626
Isn't this the gun you shoved
into Babu Ballpen's mouth?

876
01:45:26,958 --> 01:45:30,579
That's the one. Keep it

877
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:35,866
"You love guns and dons, I can see.
Don't your parents object?"

878
01:45:38,363 --> 01:45:42,110
My mother died when I was still a kid.
My dad died 10 years ago

879
01:45:44,857 --> 01:45:48,769
"Have you ever heard
of Chiman, the boatman?"

880
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:52,182
"You're Chiman, the boatman's daughter?
- Yes"

881
01:45:52,183 --> 01:45:54,263
"Chiman, the boatman's daughter?
- Oh yes"

882
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:56,678
Come here

883
01:45:56,679 --> 01:46:00,508
Chiman was your father?
- God! She's Chiman's daughter!

884
01:46:01,507 --> 01:46:04,045
She comes from a family
of thieves!

885
01:46:04,046 --> 01:46:06,168
He was the one who taught
me to handle an oar

886
01:46:06,169 --> 01:46:08,999
He was my guru!
- My father was your guru?

887
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,037
So you become my Guru now!
- How about my fee?

888
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,991
Shut the door on your way out

889
01:46:16,992 --> 01:46:19,530
"All right.
- Certainly, certainly"

890
01:46:19,531 --> 01:46:22,777
He's asking us to leave.
And you want to drink? Hurry up

891
01:46:24,568 --> 01:46:28,063
"So we leave the brother and
sister to their chat, okay?"

892
01:46:28,064 --> 01:46:33,063
Let's go

893
01:47:20,553 --> 01:47:22,550
You?

894
01:47:22,551 --> 01:47:26,089
I've brought some hot milk for you

895
01:47:28,212 --> 01:47:31,000
You drink some first

896
01:47:31,001 --> 01:47:36,582
You drink some

897
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:41,618
Drink

898
01:48:33,189 --> 01:48:37,517
What is it?
- Milk. For you

899
01:48:41,264 --> 01:48:44,343
You drink some first.
- Well?

900
01:48:44,344 --> 01:48:49,676
Drink some first

901
01:49:15,355 --> 01:49:18,226
What are you laughing for?

902
01:49:18,227 --> 01:49:21,389
You ought to have had a little.
I'd have drunk some too

903
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:24,553
Slowly... you and me...

904
01:49:24,554 --> 01:49:29,964
don't you know the trick?

905
01:49:29,965 --> 01:49:36,004
"Slowly, you sip it.
Gradually"

906
01:49:37,624 --> 01:49:41,079
You've finished the milk.
What will I drink now?

907
01:49:41,953 --> 01:49:47,076
What will I drink?

908
01:49:58,187 --> 01:50:02,224
You have fed a snake

909
01:50:02,225 --> 01:50:08,597
Only to make its venom sweeter

910
01:50:52,799 --> 01:50:55,337
"He who seeks
tears and laughter..."

911
01:50:55,338 --> 01:51:00,956
must fall in love

912
01:51:00,957 --> 01:51:03,370
He who seeks to go mad...

913
01:51:03,371 --> 01:51:08,823
must fall in love

914
01:51:08,824 --> 01:51:11,279
"He who seeks to
gain and lose..."

915
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,027
must fall in love

916
01:51:14,028 --> 01:51:18,690
He who bears every atrocity...

917
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:23,893
he who bears all the pain...

918
01:51:24,601 --> 01:51:29,096
"must fall in love, my love"

919
01:51:30,261 --> 01:51:32,799
"He who seeks
tears and laughter..."

920
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,422
must fall in love

921
01:51:35,423 --> 01:51:38,294
He who seeks to go mad...

922
01:51:38,295 --> 01:51:40,833
must fall in love

923
01:51:40,834 --> 01:51:45,163
He who bears every atrocity...

924
01:51:45,996 --> 01:51:50,658
he who bears all the pain...

925
01:51:51,282 --> 01:51:55,986
"must fall in love, my love"

926
01:52:50,348 --> 01:52:55,051
"It causes anguish,
it lends solace"

927
01:52:55,510 --> 01:53:00,505
"It makes us famous.
It makes us infamous"

928
01:53:17,279 --> 01:53:22,107
"In a moment of union
lie years of separation"

929
01:53:22,566 --> 01:53:27,478
"There's merry-making in love;
in love, there is loneliness"

930
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,962
He who seeks to dream...

931
01:53:40,963 --> 01:53:43,710
ought to fall in love

932
01:53:43,711 --> 01:53:47,583
"He who seeks to go mad...
ought to fall in love"

933
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:53,160
"He who wants to gain and lose...
ought to fall in love"

934
01:54:27,791 --> 01:54:32,496
"Guru, the Black Crow is taking
a white aircraft tomorrow..."

935
01:54:34,202 --> 01:54:39,196
and landing at daytime

936
01:54:39,197 --> 01:54:44,233
Is the Black Crow all alone?
- Oh no. The mynah's with him

937
01:54:44,234 --> 01:54:47,147
We'll fix the birds. Let them land.
- I understand

938
01:54:47,148 --> 01:54:53,100
"You plan on starting a zoo, right?
- Shut up. Why must you speak?"

939
01:55:05,046 --> 01:55:08,750
Just don't worry.
The two birds are going to be...

940
01:55:09,292 --> 01:55:13,828
Stamped.
- They're stamped already

941
01:55:13,829 --> 01:55:17,617
"We'll show them the wings,
take the pieces of glass..."

942
01:55:18,075 --> 01:55:22,736
and fly away.
- Fly away where?

943
01:55:23,112 --> 01:55:25,401
What are you talking about?
I don't understand anything

944
01:55:25,402 --> 01:55:27,606
Don't you know?
- I don't

945
01:55:27,607 --> 01:55:29,687
I always ask the wrong man

946
01:55:29,688 --> 01:55:32,559
"Doctor, that's the lingo of
the mob"

947
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:36,014
The Black Crow is Vikrant;
the mynah is his sister

948
01:55:36,015 --> 01:55:39,220
They're landing in America.
We make a meal out of them...

949
01:55:39,221 --> 01:55:42,258
and quietly have a dinner.
Get that?

950
01:55:42,259 --> 01:55:47,088
"Get what she says? There's a party.
With lunch and dinner, see?"

951
01:55:47,586 --> 01:55:49,875
"Listen, party-hopper"

952
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:52,997
"Before they land here,
we'll garland the two of them"

953
01:55:52,998 --> 01:55:55,577
"Sure, go ahead. You must
always welcome the guests"

954
01:55:55,578 --> 01:55:58,991
But what flowers will you use?
Rose or jasmine?

955
01:55:58,992 --> 01:56:01,490
This is America. You've got to
place an order in advance

956
01:56:01,491 --> 01:56:06,859
Not that! I'm talking about
the wreath you offer to the dead

957
01:56:07,151 --> 01:56:09,148
Get that?
- How would I know

958
01:56:09,149 --> 01:56:11,811
I've never been dead.
- You'll know when you die then

959
01:56:11,812 --> 01:56:15,642
All right... but how will I see it
when I die?

960
01:56:16,142 --> 01:56:19,553
You can see it when I die!
- When are you going to die?

961
01:56:19,554 --> 01:56:22,843
I'll die only after killing you!
- If the two of us die...

962
01:56:23,135 --> 01:56:27,048
"how'll we see what wreath it is?
- Lay off, Chattri"

963
01:56:30,585 --> 01:56:33,291
Skip the nonsense

964
01:56:33,292 --> 01:56:37,204
You guys think I've started
an enquiry counter here?

965
01:56:37,205 --> 01:56:42,199
You guys think so?

966
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:45,196
How many of you?

967
01:56:45,197 --> 01:56:48,444
"Once I'm done with, I'll give
three diamonds to each of you"

968
01:56:50,025 --> 01:56:54,020
Stop kicking up a racket

969
01:56:54,021 --> 01:57:00,098
I only need to make sure that
Preeti and Vikrant are killed...

970
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:06,970
and produce their death certificates
in bank

971
01:57:17,123 --> 01:57:19,702
"Sister, hurry up.
It's time for the flight"

972
01:57:19,703 --> 01:57:24,952
Coming

973
01:57:33,814 --> 01:57:39,187
"Hurry up, we're getting late"

974
01:57:49,299 --> 01:57:55,338
Pick it up... Go on!

975
01:58:11,609 --> 01:58:16,230
They've switched on so many lights.
And they call it America

976
01:58:16,231 --> 01:58:19,475
Why are we guys here?

977
01:58:19,476 --> 01:58:25,183
We're here to see the lighting
at the airport!

978
01:58:32,672 --> 01:58:37,085
"You had a nice flight, I hope?
- You're not late. We've just arrived"

979
01:58:42,912 --> 01:58:45,283
"The prey doesn't suspect
anything, does he?"

980
01:58:45,284 --> 01:58:50,820
"No inkling at all, sir.
We're only waiting for your orders."

981
01:58:54,275 --> 01:58:57,604
What is it?

982
01:58:57,605 --> 01:59:00,769
"Nothing... you had no problem
during the flight, did you?"

983
01:59:11,176 --> 01:59:13,630
Get in

984
01:59:13,631 --> 01:59:17,210
"We'll meet at the hotel and
chalk out the further plan, Anna"

985
01:59:17,211 --> 01:59:20,207
All right

986
01:59:20,208 --> 01:59:24,203
Get in

987
01:59:24,204 --> 01:59:25,743
"Threw you out, didn't he?"

988
01:59:25,744 --> 01:59:27,699
That's what happens when you
get into someone' else's car

989
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:33,615
"Come on, let's get into our car"

990
01:59:36,941 --> 01:59:41,895
Get started Guru. The Black Crow
has flown into our trap

991
01:59:44,267 --> 01:59:47,554
Where are you taking them?
- Grand Hyatt

992
01:59:47,555 --> 01:59:50,927
I'll have them check in there
and come over. Okay?

993
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:55,379
Come quickly. We'll talk it over

994
01:59:55,380 --> 02:00:00,129
All right

995
02:00:06,494 --> 02:00:09,283
I've booked a suite
on the top-floor

996
02:00:09,284 --> 02:00:14,657
You needn't worry about safety...

997
02:00:21,312 --> 02:00:24,684
You needn't worry
about Vikran't safety

998
02:00:24,685 --> 02:00:28,972
"His security reaches the place he
wants to visit, before he gets there"

999
02:00:28,973 --> 02:00:31,301
Think only about Guru

1000
02:00:31,302 --> 02:00:36,676
"Let's go, sis"

1001
02:00:41,626 --> 02:00:44,330
You're going to stay with me.
- No way!

1002
02:00:44,331 --> 02:00:46,829
"No matter where I go by day,
but I must go home at night"

1003
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:51,578
You don't know my wife...

1004
02:00:53,322 --> 02:00:56,778
I can't sleep in a new place

1005
02:00:59,150 --> 02:01:01,231
You aren't going to sleep anyway.
You're going to keep awake...

1006
02:01:01,232 --> 02:01:04,268
"so I can sleep in peace.
What say, Anna?"

1007
02:01:04,269 --> 02:01:07,016
Right

1008
02:01:07,017 --> 02:01:11,097
"Stay with him, so you can keep
an eye on the clowns around him"

1009
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:16,802
Right

1010
02:01:30,577 --> 02:01:35,950
Let him go...
what are you doing?

1011
02:01:43,897 --> 02:01:48,809
He has taken the entire top-floor
and says it's not going up

1012
02:01:49,266 --> 02:01:55,178
What's not going up?
- That thing which goes up and down

1013
02:01:55,594 --> 02:02:00,588
"An umbrella?
- No, not an umbrella"

1014
02:02:00,589 --> 02:02:03,210
It's that thing that takes
four or five guys in

1015
02:02:03,211 --> 02:02:06,416
No vulgar talk!
There are women around

1016
02:02:06,874 --> 02:02:09,537
It isn't vulgar talk.
How am I going to explain!

1017
02:02:09,538 --> 02:02:12,826
What do they call it...?
- The lift

1018
02:02:14,575 --> 02:02:18,278
He says no one is going up

1019
02:02:18,279 --> 02:02:22,484
"Don't worry, Yeda.
I'll deal with him"

1020
02:02:24,565 --> 02:02:28,185
"His thugs hang around the lift, right?"

1021
02:02:28,186 --> 02:02:31,349
I'll get on the wall
like a lizard one night...

1022
02:02:31,849 --> 02:02:35,261
get into his room and beat
the daylights out of him

1023
02:02:35,262 --> 02:02:38,717
I'll fix him nice and properly...

1024
02:02:38,718 --> 02:02:43,882
Guru...
- What is it?

1025
02:02:48,291 --> 02:02:51,745
"Chattri, what are you doing here?"

1026
02:02:51,746 --> 02:02:55,741
Was I expected to kill time there?

1027
02:02:55,742 --> 02:03:01,152
Didn't I tell you to
keep an eye on Vikrant?

1028
02:03:01,153 --> 02:03:04,941
And Vikrant was kidnapped
by Guru's men!

1029
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:11,643
Who kidnapped him?
- You sent those Chinese thugs

1030
02:03:11,976 --> 02:03:14,514
What Chinese thugs did I send?

1031
02:03:14,515 --> 02:03:17,761
This guy looks Chinese to you?
Do they look Chinese to you?

1032
02:03:18,344 --> 02:03:21,924
So who were those guys?
- One moment. I say...

1033
02:03:22,215 --> 02:03:25,254
"those guys who came to kidnap him,
did they leave a business-card?"

1034
02:03:26,294 --> 02:03:27,959
"Shut up, Chattri"

1035
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:32,080
We must first find out where those
Chinese guys have taken Vikrant

1036
02:03:32,622 --> 02:03:35,451
Will we have to go to China
to find him now?

1037
02:03:35,452 --> 02:03:38,824
"I can't even speak the language.
Can you speak it, Mangal?"

1038
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:41,153
Shut up!

1039
02:03:41,154 --> 02:03:44,109
Vikrant has been kidnapped.
Whom are we going to bump off now?

1040
02:03:44,110 --> 02:03:46,273
How'll we get the death certificate?
- How'll we get...

1041
02:03:46,274 --> 02:03:50,145
the diamonds from the bank?
- I lose three diamonds then!

1042
02:03:50,562 --> 02:03:53,600
"You can't handle anything
properly, railway-line"

1043
02:03:53,601 --> 02:03:56,805
I've been noticing. You're no good.
- It isn't his mistake

1044
02:03:56,806 --> 02:03:59,427
It was the crazy Anna's plan.
A stupid plan!

1045
02:03:59,428 --> 02:04:03,757
"No, Mummy. It was Guru's plan.
- Guru's plan was fool-proof"

1046
02:04:13,164 --> 02:04:17,201
Quiet... quiet...

1047
02:04:17,202 --> 02:04:22,238
shut up!

1048
02:04:22,239 --> 02:04:25,943
Shut up! Shut up!

1049
02:04:25,944 --> 02:04:29,272
Listen... whose call was it?

1050
02:04:29,273 --> 02:04:34,267
Vikrant's such a...
- Such a what?

1051
02:04:34,268 --> 02:04:38,847
Such a what?
- That which has little babies...

1052
02:04:40,221 --> 02:04:43,508
What babies? Puppies?
Cubs...?

1053
02:04:43,509 --> 02:04:46,588
Whatever... who has babies?

1054
02:04:46,589 --> 02:04:48,253
The mother has babies

1055
02:04:48,254 --> 02:04:51,250
Not mother. What is the
mother's husband called?

1056
02:04:51,251 --> 02:04:53,373
What do they call
the mother's husband?

1057
02:04:53,374 --> 02:04:56,204
"Uncle! Uncle!
- No, daddy..."

1058
02:04:56,205 --> 02:04:59,284
uncle is the mother's brother.
- The mother's brother is an uncle

1059
02:04:59,285 --> 02:05:01,282
One moment!

1060
02:05:01,283 --> 02:05:04,696
This woman is a mother.
Mona's her daughter...

1061
02:05:05,196 --> 02:05:09,857
what will she call
her mother's husband?

1062
02:05:09,858 --> 02:05:12,021
Father!

1063
02:05:12,022 --> 02:05:13,187
Father!

1064
02:05:13,188 --> 02:05:15,642
He has turned out to be
our father in wisdom

1065
02:05:15,643 --> 02:05:19,056
The guy we took for Vikrant
turned out to be his duplicate

1066
02:05:19,514 --> 02:05:22,845
The real Vikrant is coming in...
what do you call it?

1067
02:05:23,178 --> 02:05:24,675
Mail?
- Plane

1068
02:05:24,676 --> 02:05:29,633
He's coming in a plane

1069
02:06:20,121 --> 02:06:23,449
We mustn't waste anymore time

1070
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:27,613
We must finish Guru Gulab Khatri.
Where will we find him?

1071
02:06:28,154 --> 02:06:30,776
There's this Indo-American
charity dinner today

1072
02:06:30,777 --> 02:06:34,356
He must performing there.
- Very well then. Let him perform

1073
02:06:35,272 --> 02:06:37,310
And we'll finish him off
right there

1074
02:06:37,311 --> 02:06:43,601
"All right, sir.
Just keep the money ready"

1075
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:15,546
My love...

1076
02:08:15,547 --> 02:08:21,585
sweetheart...

1077
02:08:34,611 --> 02:08:39,984
Don't touch me!

1078
02:08:54,341 --> 02:08:58,003
My love...

1079
02:08:58,004 --> 02:09:01,376
sweetheart

1080
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,038
"I'm all alone,
and it's difficult..."

1081
02:09:05,455 --> 02:09:08,992
with danger everywhere around

1082
02:09:08,993 --> 02:09:12,365
"So come to me, my love"

1083
02:09:18,526 --> 02:09:22,896
No one is escaping me...

1084
02:09:23,229 --> 02:09:28,602
my love

1085
02:09:33,219 --> 02:09:39,421
"I'm known for being wayward...
crazy and insane"

1086
02:09:40,254 --> 02:09:43,833
"Come to me, my love"

1087
02:10:17,716 --> 02:10:21,295
The nights will change...

1088
02:10:21,296 --> 02:10:24,916
so will the prattle

1089
02:10:24,917 --> 02:10:31,203
"Moments of love will
merge with desire"

1090
02:10:47,145 --> 02:10:50,559
"I'm on a high,
my heart says..."

1091
02:10:51,016 --> 02:10:56,218
look at me

1092
02:10:56,219 --> 02:10:59,467
"Come to me, my love"

1093
02:10:59,923 --> 02:11:03,421
"Come to me, my love"

1094
02:11:40,799 --> 02:11:44,462
I aim for him

1095
02:11:44,463 --> 02:11:48,125
"It all depends
on how he makes it"

1096
02:11:48,126 --> 02:11:51,164
His life is in danger...

1097
02:11:51,788 --> 02:11:57,661
whoever stands before my gun

1098
02:12:10,270 --> 02:12:13,518
"I'll take you in my arms,
play with your tresses..."

1099
02:12:13,891 --> 02:12:19,219
"beware, my love"

1100
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:25,717
"Come to me, my love"

1101
02:13:17,204 --> 02:13:20,531
Put a coin first

1102
02:13:20,532 --> 02:13:26,614
This is a mobile phone.
What coin?

1103
02:13:33,188 --> 02:13:36,515
On the bridge

1104
02:13:36,516 --> 02:13:43,013
This wooden bridge along the sea...

1105
02:13:45,259 --> 02:13:48,297
What cops!

1106
02:13:48,298 --> 02:13:52,293
Give me the phone...
and cut the crap

1107
02:13:52,294 --> 02:13:58,666
What cops are these?
The guys in Mumbai are better

1108
02:14:27,217 --> 02:14:30,337
"Out with it, my friend...
three diamonds for me"

1109
02:14:30,338 --> 02:14:32,211
My boss Yeda Anna sees it first

1110
02:14:32,212 --> 02:14:35,833
My boss will show it to me first.
- My Guru will show me first

1111
02:14:36,208 --> 02:14:40,952
To hell with all that...
give me the diamonds

1112
02:14:40,953 --> 02:14:45,452
There seems to be fire somewhere

1113
02:16:19,146 --> 02:16:20,768
You?
- Vikrant?

1114
02:16:20,769 --> 02:16:22,433
How come...
- he's alive?

1115
02:16:22,434 --> 02:16:26,015
"He's not a ghost, is he?"

1116
02:16:26,555 --> 02:16:30,176
"You bite the dust at
my hands again, don't you?"

1117
02:16:30,177 --> 02:16:34,213
You thought Vikrant was dead?

1118
02:16:34,214 --> 02:16:38,375
Sacrificed for diamonds
worth 2 billion?

1119
02:16:38,376 --> 02:16:41,582
The guy who landed first
was me. The real Vikrant

1120
02:16:42,664 --> 02:16:44,995
I faked that kidnap drama

1121
02:16:44,996 --> 02:16:48,991
The one who got killed
was a fake

1122
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:53,277
"According to police records,
Vikrant is dead"

1123
02:16:53,278 --> 02:16:56,316
His sins and his crimes
are dead with him

1124
02:16:56,692 --> 02:17:01,770
I'll bury all of you here
and start life afresh

1125
02:17:08,555 --> 02:17:12,967
Give me the diamonds

1126
02:17:12,968 --> 02:17:15,214
Hurry up and give me
the diamonds

1127
02:17:15,215 --> 02:17:20,630
The diamonds are here

1128
02:17:58,255 --> 02:18:01,126
The diamonds are lying in the car!

1129
02:18:01,127 --> 02:18:06,251
Stop there...

1130
02:18:07,204 --> 02:18:12,203
where is the bag?

1131
02:18:25,228 --> 02:18:31,351
Hurry! Step on it!

1132
02:19:43,108 --> 02:19:48,482
Take it back...

1133
02:20:53,163 --> 02:20:58,911
Get out of the car

1134
02:21:55,059 --> 02:22:01,015
Look for the diamonds
in the car

1135
02:22:55,291 --> 02:23:01,663
"The diamonds are with Vikrant.
Follow him, Anna"

1136
02:25:00,207 --> 02:25:06,206
God! Save me from him!

1137
02:26:03,144 --> 02:26:06,140
You're going to die anyway...
so give it to me!

1138
02:26:06,141 --> 02:26:11,556
Save me from this guy first!

1139
02:27:42,712 --> 02:27:46,167
You're not going away!
You can't defeat me!

1140
02:27:49,622 --> 02:27:52,617
No... I'm not going to spare you!

1141
02:27:52,618 --> 02:27:56,613
Scoundrel!

1142
02:27:56,614 --> 02:28:01,988
I won't spare you!

1143
02:28:28,208 --> 02:28:31,912
"Come on inside.
For you, we were..."

1144
02:28:32,287 --> 02:28:35,200
I know you were waiting for me

1145
02:28:35,201 --> 02:28:37,989
Who has the bag of the diamonds?
Out with it. Let's split it

1146
02:28:37,990 --> 02:28:40,278
Oh yes. Let's split it.
Bring out the diamonds

1147
02:28:40,279 --> 02:28:44,274
"Out with it, Mother.
- Sure. Bring out the diamonds"

1148
02:28:44,275 --> 02:28:47,188
Out with the diamonds.
- I never ever saw real stones

1149
02:28:47,189 --> 02:28:49,436
Out with it.
- Rotten mango!

1150
02:28:49,437 --> 02:28:53,183
They're diamonds... not stones!
Out with the bag

1151
02:28:53,558 --> 02:28:56,928
Sure. Out with it.
Why are you asking for permission?

1152
02:28:56,929 --> 02:29:00,510
Why're you guys asking one another
to get out the diamonds?

1153
02:29:01,217 --> 02:29:04,046
Where's the bag?

1154
02:29:04,047 --> 02:29:07,126
"Yeda, where's the bag son?
- I don't have it"

1155
02:29:07,127 --> 02:29:10,249
"Chattri, give me that bag"

1156
02:29:10,250 --> 02:29:14,078
"Mammo, give them the bag"

1157
02:29:14,079 --> 02:29:16,201
I don't have it.
- No?

1158
02:29:16,202 --> 02:29:20,406
"No. Oh yes, I remember...
I threw the bag to Mona"

1159
02:29:20,905 --> 02:29:22,735
"Mona darling, let's have the bag"

1160
02:29:22,736 --> 02:29:25,234
I don't have it.
- What?

1161
02:29:25,235 --> 02:29:29,687
"I mean, when those monsters
advanced towards me..."

1162
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:34,849
I tossed the bag to my sidekick.
- What are you talking about?

1163
02:29:35,308 --> 02:29:39,346
"You gave that bag to me?
- No keeping it all for yourself, son"

1164
02:29:39,802 --> 02:29:43,840
Let's have that bag now.
- At least give me those 3 diamonds!

1165
02:29:44,216 --> 02:29:46,296
"Wait, I remember..."

1166
02:29:46,297 --> 02:29:49,541
"when I was saving Tina,
I gave the bag to Manilal"

1167
02:29:49,542 --> 02:29:52,415
So catch hold of Manilal!
What say?

1168
02:29:52,416 --> 02:29:55,953
"Why're you staring at me, tarpaulin?
- Chhota Chattri!"

1169
02:29:56,329 --> 02:29:58,409
Who's Chhota Chattri?
- My name is Chhota Chattri

1170
02:29:58,410 --> 02:30:02,114
"So what's with your name?
- Don't drive me mad, Manilal..."

1171
02:30:02,488 --> 02:30:05,068
He's Manilal! I told you!
Catch hold of him!

1172
02:30:05,069 --> 02:30:08,107
You're Manilal!
- But you said you're Manilal

1173
02:30:08,108 --> 02:30:10,272
"Manilal, come on"

1174
02:30:10,273 --> 02:30:12,602
The diamonds are not with me!

1175
02:30:12,603 --> 02:30:14,725
"So who has the diamonds,
if not you?"

1176
02:30:14,726 --> 02:30:17,223
"Speak up, or I'm going to
make you sing like a parrot!"

1177
02:30:17,224 --> 02:30:21,677
I remember! It's Popatlal!
- Now who's Popatlal?

1178
02:30:22,261 --> 02:30:25,340
The guy who was fighting there...

1179
02:30:25,341 --> 02:30:29,295
Now what's his name...?
Fevicol!

1180
02:30:29,296 --> 02:30:32,583
"This guy didn't give the diamonds
to Vikrant, did he?"

1181
02:30:33,292 --> 02:30:37,163
You've uttered every bloody name!
So who is it? Fevicol or Popatlal?

1182
02:30:37,494 --> 02:30:40,950
To Ranipal.
- And who's Ranipal?

1183
02:30:41,284 --> 02:30:43,447
Rekha's husband.
- Who's Rekha now?

1184
02:30:43,448 --> 02:30:47,153
My daughter.
- He gave the diamonds to Anmol

1185
02:30:47,609 --> 02:30:52,022
That's what I've been telling you.
- You've driven us all crazy!

1186
02:30:52,438 --> 02:30:55,227
"How many names will we play with?
- We have the name now, don't we?"

1187
02:30:55,228 --> 02:30:58,432
So let's have the diamonds.
- But where is Anmol?

1188
02:30:58,807 --> 02:31:02,553
"Think again, Anmol.
Guru has a terrible temper"

1189
02:31:03,137 --> 02:31:07,298
He could even kill you

1190
02:31:07,299 --> 02:31:10,877
"There's no turning back
for me, Preeti"

1191
02:31:10,878 --> 02:31:14,916
I promised to return
all your happiness to you

1192
02:31:15,623 --> 02:31:20,872
Now is the time

1193
02:31:22,616 --> 02:31:25,487
This is Anmol here.
- Where did you go away to?

1194
02:31:25,488 --> 02:31:27,319
Where are the diamonds?

1195
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:30,440
"Preeti and the diamonds
are both with me, Guru"

1196
02:31:30,441 --> 02:31:33,106
So what are you doing there?
Come here immediately!

1197
02:31:33,107 --> 02:31:35,145
"No, Guru.
- No?"

1198
02:31:35,146 --> 02:31:38,184
The two of us have taken a decision.
- What decision?

1199
02:31:38,185 --> 02:31:40,306
We don't want to live
in your world anymore

1200
02:31:40,307 --> 02:31:41,805
What are you getting at?

1201
02:31:41,806 --> 02:31:44,510
"I mean, I don't want
to live with Mona"

1202
02:31:44,511 --> 02:31:48,175
So tell your wife that you don't
want to live with her! Why tell me?

1203
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:52,253
Just bring the diamonds here!

1204
02:31:52,254 --> 02:31:55,000
Preeti wants to be free of
her marital obligations too

1205
02:31:55,001 --> 02:31:59,329
To hell with Preeti!
Just get the diamonds here!

1206
02:31:59,330 --> 02:32:02,160
I'll give you the diamonds.
But I have a condition

1207
02:32:02,161 --> 02:32:05,405
What condition?

1208
02:32:05,406 --> 02:32:09,071
You'll have to separate from Preeti.
- Bloody monkey!

1209
02:32:10,610 --> 02:32:15,230
You dare put conditions
to Gulab Khatri?

1210
02:32:15,231 --> 02:32:19,391
I won't give her a divorce.
Do whatever you want to!

1211
02:32:19,392 --> 02:32:22,430
What do you love more?
The diamonds? Or Preeti?

1212
02:32:22,431 --> 02:32:23,930
I love the diamonds

1213
02:32:23,931 --> 02:32:27,509
So sign the divorce papers and come
to the docks at 5 this evening

1214
02:32:31,298 --> 02:32:36,168
The two-penny dentist asks
Gulab Khatri to divorce his wife!

1215
02:33:05,972 --> 02:33:09,508
I was blinded by your love.
And you...?

1216
02:33:09,509 --> 02:33:14,379
You don't love that woman.
You haven't spent a moment with her

1217
02:33:15,087 --> 02:33:17,209
You haven't even touched her

1218
02:33:17,210 --> 02:33:19,331
Your marriage with her
was a farce

1219
02:33:19,332 --> 02:33:22,496
"And yet, to nurse your false ego,
you don't wish to break it"

1220
02:33:23,288 --> 02:33:28,826
This is certainly not
what I expected from you

1221
02:33:29,322 --> 02:33:33,902
"Tina, for the first time in my life,
I've thought of another human-being..."

1222
02:33:34,193 --> 02:33:40,607
other than myself.
And that's you

1223
02:34:59,274 --> 02:35:03,145
Well Yeda? You betray me?

1224
02:35:03,146 --> 02:35:08,058
You've been the biggest ingrate yet
and talk to me about loyalty?

1225
02:35:09,140 --> 02:35:12,678
You think Anna is deaf?

1226
02:35:13,136 --> 02:35:15,508
You will have a ball with
2 billion rupees...

1227
02:35:15,509 --> 02:35:18,296
and expect me to rot
with a few million?

1228
02:35:18,297 --> 02:35:22,335
Give it to me... Go on!
Don't stare at my face!

1229
02:36:14,283 --> 02:36:17,738
"Don't be afraid, Anna!
I'm on my way!"

1230
02:36:56,241 --> 02:37:02,738
"You can't get away with the diamonds,
Guru... I won't spare you!"

1231
02:37:11,267 --> 02:37:17,219
Anna! I'm coming!

1232
02:37:17,220 --> 02:37:20,216
Yeda... over here

1233
02:37:20,217 --> 02:37:24,421
Enough of your song and dance.
Throw the bag to me now. Go on

1234
02:37:25,087 --> 02:37:29,000
"Hurry up! Throw the bag to me.
- Give it away, Anna. He'll kill me"

1235
02:37:34,911 --> 02:37:39,156
"And watch your balance, please.
Chattri, take care of your boss"

1236
02:37:40,322 --> 02:37:42,944
"You shoulder the
responsibility now, okay?"

1237
02:37:42,945 --> 02:37:46,815
Why're you giving me extra inches?
At least give that to me...

1238
02:37:47,273 --> 02:37:50,061
what do you call it? What...?
He can't tell me!

1239
02:37:50,062 --> 02:37:52,309
At least give me a stool.
- Don't move

1240
02:37:52,310 --> 02:37:55,056
Or Yeda'll be twisted forever

1241
02:37:55,057 --> 02:38:00,843
"Know what, Yeda? The whole world
knows I always keep my promise"

1242
02:38:01,717 --> 02:38:04,505
You and I had a deal for
50 million worth of diamonds

1243
02:38:04,506 --> 02:38:08,002
Here you are...
diamonds worth 50 million

1244
02:38:09,210 --> 02:38:11,915
And here's a special offer
for Diwali

1245
02:38:11,916 --> 02:38:15,078
Three diamonds free
for both of you! Free!

1246
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:22,820
I'll make a move now

1247
02:38:22,821 --> 02:38:26,109
O one who leaves...

1248
02:38:26,609 --> 02:38:31,104
turn back and look at me...

1249
02:38:34,476 --> 02:38:38,346
Anna...
- What?

1250
02:38:38,347 --> 02:38:42,426
Can you hold your breath for 5 minutes
while I get the stuff together?

1251
02:38:42,843 --> 02:38:45,714
Shut up! I'm in this soup
because of you

1252
02:38:45,715 --> 02:38:47,837
I'll beat you up when
I get my hands on you

1253
02:38:47,838 --> 02:38:51,168
"I've adjusted with you
all my life, Anna"

1254
02:38:51,625 --> 02:38:54,830
Can't you adjust with me for 5 minutes?
- Stand there quietly

1255
02:38:54,831 --> 02:38:57,660
"How about 4 minutes?
- Stand there, I said!"

1256
02:38:57,661 --> 02:39:00,657
I'll come back and stand here.
- Just keep standing!

1257
02:39:00,658 --> 02:39:02,822
Keep standing... don't move

1258
02:39:02,823 --> 02:39:08,862
I got into this mess
because of you. Stay there!

1259
02:39:09,482 --> 02:39:15,521
What are you doing?
Free my hands first!

1260
02:39:22,886 --> 02:39:27,380
What is the matter?
Why are you so sad?

1261
02:39:27,381 --> 02:39:31,086
I've been thinking...
- What?

1262
02:39:35,956 --> 02:39:40,576
"We're returning to India,
but I have nothing to give you"

1263
02:39:41,201 --> 02:39:43,447
Not even a house

1264
02:39:43,448 --> 02:39:47,069
I can give you nothing
except my love

1265
02:39:47,070 --> 02:39:50,483
"You can give me love, can't you?
And who says you have no house?"

1266
02:39:51,315 --> 02:39:54,771
You have such a large heart...
I'll live in it

1267
02:39:55,603 --> 02:40:00,515
"Mad girl... when the bills arrive,
the heart won't do"

1268
02:40:01,014 --> 02:40:04,095
"You'll need cash to settle them.
- Daddy, you?"

1269
02:40:04,427 --> 02:40:07,632
"Yes, daddy"

1270
02:40:07,633 --> 02:40:11,837
What are you doing in these clothes?
- Forget the clothes and take this

1271
02:40:12,212 --> 02:40:18,168
What is it?
- Just keep it! Don't ask

1272
02:40:28,278 --> 02:40:30,359
Diamonds?

1273
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:34,190
But who gave you these diamonds?
- I'll tell you. His name...

1274
02:40:35,271 --> 02:40:38,267
I've forgotten the name again!

1275
02:40:38,268 --> 02:40:42,848
I've done nothing...
I did nothing!

1276
02:40:43,347 --> 02:40:46,593
That's how my son-in-law is...
I didn't do a thing!

1277
02:40:46,594 --> 02:40:50,255
Shut up...
- I haven't done anything

1278
02:40:50,256 --> 02:40:52,920
Shut up

1279
02:40:52,921 --> 02:40:58,460
It hurts

1280
02:41:00,330 --> 02:41:04,533
Here you are. That's Preeti's share
of the diamonds

1281
02:41:04,534 --> 02:41:09,195
"Your three diamonds are
in it too, you rascal"

1282
02:41:09,196 --> 02:41:13,109
You're such a nice guy...
- No abuses!

1283
02:41:13,692 --> 02:41:17,354
Don't say such things. Guru never
takes away what is someone else's due

1284
02:41:18,187 --> 02:41:22,599
Get that?
- Very well...

1285
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:25,387
Let's go and drink coffee.
- No...

1286
02:41:25,388 --> 02:41:28,217
Let's have some coffee.
- Not coffee

1287
02:41:28,218 --> 02:41:30,674
"I'm fasting today...
- Oh, come on"

1288
02:41:30,675 --> 02:41:36,006
I'm fasting today!

1289
02:41:37,293 --> 02:41:40,498
I couldn't ever imagine Guru
would have such a big heart

1290
02:41:40,956 --> 02:41:45,493
"Forget about him. Just make merry,
why worry about details?"

1291
02:41:46,659 --> 02:41:50,697
Anmol... Preeti...
may you always be happy

1292
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:54,150
"You're amazing, daddy!
- How come?"

1293
02:41:54,151 --> 02:41:57,272
You remembered our names!

1294
02:41:57,273 --> 02:41:59,562
Did I...?

1295
02:41:59,563 --> 02:42:02,267
This is a miracle!

1296
02:42:02,268 --> 02:42:05,557
"As soon as I get the diamonds,
Jayantilal's problem is solved!"

1297
02:42:05,931 --> 02:42:11,553
"Manilal!
- Manilal, who?"
