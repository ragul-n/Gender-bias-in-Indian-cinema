1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:43,478
"What happens
 when a boy..."

3
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:49,109
"meets a girl
 for the first time?"

4
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:55,156
Love? Or romance?

5
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:16,386
"What happens
 when a girl..."

6
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:21,057
"meets a boy
 for the first time?"

7
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:27,439
Love? Or Romance?

8
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:42,078
Goodness! Killed me!

9
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,295
He killed me!

10
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,100
Yes?
 What's the matter?

11
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:11,399
Kamlabai! Haven't I told you not to
 swab this room in the morning?

12
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,568
Go... clean Priya's room.
 - Yes madam

13
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:18,281
Well! Women these days
 have really lost their minds

14
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,076
Priya!
 Aren't you going to college?

15
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:25,121
There was this representative who had
 come wearing such a skimpy dress

16
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,875
"Goodness! For almost half-hour,
 none of the guys worked"

17
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,378
"Really?
 - Yes. I tell you, the fault..."

18
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,130
lies entirely with the parents. Why
 give their kids so much of liberty?

19
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,760
Earlier it was not so. I remember
 my Ma wearing such lovely dresses

20
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,557
Wherever she went they used to ask...
 Shameless! Is this any dress?

21
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:49,437
"You mean this dress? It's fine.
 - Fine, really? Wrong. It's filthy!"

22
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,649
And you've lost your mind!
 - You are over-reacting

23
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,527
"It looks odd at home,
 but it's fashion in college"

24
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,321
"Right, Papa. Short dresses
 are in vogue"

25
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:02,617
I see. Even Payal goes to college.
 - To each his own likes and dislikes

26
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,748
I don't want guys to call me a nun.
 - I care a damn. I'm off

27
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,042
Where to?
 - Drop me at the college

28
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:16,256
"I'm already late. Well, call
 your brother too. I'll drop him also"

29
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,676
He isn't ready yet.
 He's still hogging the bathroom

30
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:25,181
"Baby, make him see reason. The
 vacations are over. It's time to study"

31
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:30,228
"By the way, what could he be doing
 for so long in the bathroom?"

32
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,445
"Not going to college, Rajiv?
 - Going Ma, going"

33
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,449
"Make it fast, will you?
 - Coming Ma"

34
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,245
I have no one else but you

35
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,510
Packed

36
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,597
"Okay, cute.
 What I can't figure is..."

37
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,351
why doesn't God give girls
 good taste with good looks?

38
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,063
Otherwise is it possible for a guy
 like me to still remain a stag?

39
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:18,401
"What do Javed and Danny, the studs
 of Spencer College, have that I don't?"

40
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,326
No more am I going to be a stag
 nor will my best friend Mambo

41
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,748
Should be Mambo

42
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,675
"Yes, it is Rajiv's house"

43
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,513
Is Rajiv in?
 - Yes. Come on in

44
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,099
My goodness!

45
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:54,104
"If he's asleep, let him be.
 - No sir, he's up"

46
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:58,483
"Fine, I'll sit here"

47
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,789
It's soiled over here

48
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,750
Goodness

49
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,047
Well... what's your name?
 - Kamla

50
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:26,261
"Kamla, my blossom,
 when do I strike?"

51
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:40,108
"Kamla, clean my room, please.
 - Right, sir"

52
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,111
Come on. Do you want to be late
 on the very first day of college?

53
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,823
Late? I'm laminated!
 - Dammit

54
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,201
You never told me!
 - About?

55
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:55,915
"The item.
 - Item...? She's a maidservant, buddy"

56
00:06:55,915 --> 00:07:00,128
"Go on, Mambo.
 - Isn't a maidservant human?"

57
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,257
"Hey social worker,
 at least think of the status!"

58
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:09,679
"Damn the status!
 Once a sucker, always a sucker"

59
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,142
"Kamla, I'm crazy about you"

60
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,022
Yes?
 - During holidays...

61
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,610
I set the field for a babe

62
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,654
Who is it? Where? How? In detail.
 - Shall I?

63
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,697
Tell me.
 - Shall I?

64
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,200
"Out with it, pronto.
 - It's Dolly"

65
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,452
Dolly Jagtiani? Damn!
 - What's wrong?

66
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:37,457
"I was angling her. Dolly gone!
 All right, if not Dolly..."

67
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:43,004
"Polly! Polly Pereira,
 we're made for each other"

68
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,526
"Hi Virgins, is something happening?
 Or is the same old handling-the-snake?"

69
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,447
"Danny, those days are over.
 Because Rajiv has a girlfriend now"

70
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,409
What are you saying?
 - Everything is set

71
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,704
The iron is hot...
 he just got to strike

72
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:20,500
Really? What's the hot iron called?

73
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,257
What are you talking?

74
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,093
A century in debut

75
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:34,723
"Give us a few tips, please.
 - Try Taurani. I don't have time"

76
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,358
And Saloni

77
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:50,363
"Saloni, try me"

78
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:57,704
"Busted! Which means,
 she took you for a ride"

79
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:08,214
"Rajiv, weren't you talking
 about your new girlfriend?"

80
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:15,221
Miss Touch-me-not!
 - She loves to make brothers

81
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,228
How are you?

82
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,609
"Hi nun.
 - Dolly, they addressed you"

83
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,447
Bore! Let's get out of here

84
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,453
"Something's burning, isn't it Danny?"

85
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,540
You ruined it.
 - Quiet

86
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:49,255
Vacation was boring. I missed college.
 - Missed college? Or...?

87
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,053
I had real fun

88
00:09:55,053 --> 00:10:01,101
"Rajiv, how's everyone at home?
 - Yes Rajiv, how's everyone at home?"

89
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,272
"Everybody is fine at my place too.
 Mom, Dad, dogs and cats... all fine"

90
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:22,080
"She's so cute, no?
 - Can't help it. She belongs to Javed"

91
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,293
"Not Dolly, I'm talking about Payal.
 - Are you crazy?"

92
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,713
Didn't you hear what they called her?
 A nun

93
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,757
"Shut up. She's in love with you,
 that too since school days"

94
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:37,137
A girlfriend ought to be like Dolly
 or Saloni. Guys should envy

95
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,806
What?
 - Envy

96
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,892
"Pereira, we're made for each other"

97
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,853
Shall I...?
 - Go on

98
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,856
Go on

99
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,784
What happened?
 - Not my cup of tea... impossible

100
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,749
Don't involve me with Payal

101
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,669
"They are two, so are we. We can
 make great couples. Let's go and chat"

102
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,088
They are too thin.
 - You're too choosy

103
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,134
A beggar ought to make do
 with whatever is given to him

104
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,763
"What will you have?
 - One burger, one hot-dog and chips"

105
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:24,726
"One burger, one hot-dog,
 chips and one Coke. Quick"

106
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,116
I just can't figure Rocky out

107
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,119
I haven't got to know
 which year student he is

108
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,164
We are his students.
 He changes girlfriends...

109
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:50,710
like the movies change every Friday.
 Look at him getting cozy

110
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,714
How dare you call me up?

111
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,468
I won't call up again

112
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,555
"Get that, Mambo? One more breakup.
 - Another girl is dumped"

113
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,643
"If you call me up again,
 I'll lodge a police complaint"

114
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:11,314
Never again! Don't shout.
 My reputation...

115
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,151
We did have a nice time

116
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,822
"You are too good, Rocky.
 You are a love Guru"

117
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:23,076
"Don't mind this Rocky,
 but the babe went fuming"

118
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,665
"The typical sticky type.
 Easy to woo, hard to dump"

119
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,128
If you don't mind
 may I ask you something?

120
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,839
"One moment, sonny.
 - How come you woo so many girls?"

121
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,216
Is there a fixed formula?
 - No fixed formula

122
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,844
Treat each girl the way she is

123
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,138
Give him 2 bucks.
 - Sure

124
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,433
"You wanted information about
 Pallavi Pradhan, didn't you? Listen"

125
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,144
"Apart from college, between 8 to 10
 on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays..."

126
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,355
she attends classes in Juhu.
 She takes the no. 32 bus at 7:15

127
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,859
But that boyfriend of hers...
 - They split

128
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,863
Stay away from her father. He's wild.
 I didn't need that though

129
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,158
"We're friends, after all.
 Being a G. S pays"

130
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,660
G. S...?
 - General Secretary

131
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,082
No! G. S means
 Girls Samachari (Informer)

132
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:22,052
"Mr. Love Guru,
 give us tips to woo girls?"

133
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,304
"Have some...
 - Massage! No thanks, I hog all day"

134
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,183
"Love Guru, your love strategy bombed"

135
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,770
The game of love for me is over

136
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,524
"Ass! Go, get an answer from her"

137
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,363
You don't have to do much.
 Just buy her a rose

138
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,720
Fall in love

139
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,223
Don't fear love

140
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,684
Live it up

141
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,813
Give away your heart to someone

142
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,149
"Love Guru, you said I'd make it"

143
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,446
"Believe me, I was thrashed real hard"

144
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,789
This Love Guru is a fake

145
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,166
He's a rotten potato

146
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,629
"He's going to ruin you.
 - He's going to have you beaten up"

147
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,426
"He's going to have you rusticated.
 - He will have you tonsured"

148
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,639
"He'll have your limbs broken.
 - He'll land you in trouble"

149
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,438
Fall in love

150
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,773
Don't fear love

151
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,984
Learn to steal a heart

152
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,321
Fall in love

153
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,744
"What's got into Mambo?
 Mambo, careful"

154
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,497
He's made it!

155
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,177
"Coffee, tea or me?
 Impossible"

156
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,721
"Wham-bham, thank-you-ma'am
 ...impossible"

157
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,766
One night stand... impossible

158
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,561
So what's possible?

159
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:41,399
"Candlelight dinner... done.
 - Lovely-Lovely music... done"

160
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:46,488
"Long-Long drive... done.
 - Sweet-sweet talk... done"

161
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,742
Fall in love

162
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,161
Don't fear love

163
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,789
Learn to steal hearts

164
00:15:55,789 --> 00:16:00,168
Fall in love

165
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:13,139
"Dance in discos... a must.
 - If you give us some chances"

166
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,686
"Coke, popcorn and wafers... must.
 - In an empty theatre that is"

167
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:22,565
"Rides in motorbikes... must.
 - Apply brakes every now and then"

168
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,735
Always stay alert

169
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,154
You need to flirt a little

170
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,573
"Some love.
 - Everything!"

171
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,244
"Some romance.
 - Give us a chance"

172
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:38,623
Fall in love

173
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:43,503
Learn to steal hearts

174
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,299
Fall in love

175
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:53,346
Live it up

176
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,593
This year I want awards in all three.
 You dig? I don't know how you do it

177
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,721
"Dramatics, painting and dancing...
 I want awards in all three"

178
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,516
What yes? How will you do it?

179
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:46,024
As usual I kicked up a fuss to have
 you enrolled in the dance competition

180
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,781
Worry not

181
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:58,161
And what am I enrolled in?
 - In the audience

182
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:05,043
"If there's no audience,
 who will watch the show?"

183
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,011
Who is Neela?
 - Tonight at 12:30...

184
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,014
they're airing a blue film

185
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:23,019
Our cable operator Manoj sends such
 messages to special viewers like me

186
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,147
What are you saying? A blue film?
 - It's true

187
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:30,026
"At 12:30 tonight, switch on to
 the sports channel"

188
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:35,156
The sports signal goes off
 and the big game begins

189
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:11,651
What are you doing so late in the night?
 - Watching Mohenjo-Daro

190
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,696
Mohenjo-Daro...? Is it some suspense
 thriller in Sindhi language?

191
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:19,159
"No Dad, it's on the
 Discovery Channel, Mohenjo-Daro..."

192
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,662
I see. Mohenjo-Daro and Harrappa
 civilizations. My favorite subject

193
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,999
"Why are you sitting, Dad?
 - Must be a half-hour show"

194
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,710
"I can't stand and watch, can I?
 Not yet on air?"

195
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,755
No

196
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:46,770
Yes Dad?
 - It's time...

197
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,732
for me to tell you about kids

198
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,152
"You might think I'm a kid,
 but I'm grown up, Dad"

199
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,072
When I say kids what I mean is...
 - Goddamn! Is he going...

200
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:02,160
to lecture me on some nonsense?
 - Suppose there's a boy

201
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,414
and a girl...
 - Yes Dad

202
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,627
"When they come together,
 what happens?"

203
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,798
That thought haunts me day and night

204
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,842
"Wedding, Dad?
 - No, before that. No..."

205
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:22,263
what happens immediately after wedding?
 - The big game!

206
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,475
"If everything goes fine it's happiness
 all the way. Else, it's tragedy"

207
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:29,813
"No, you went too far.
 A little before that"

208
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,816
"It's our honeymoon...
 let me take your veil off"

209
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,152
"Roaming around having fun.
 - Honeymoon, right?"

210
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:40,198
Right.
 - So what happens in honeymoon?

211
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,743
Big game!

212
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,544
Mambo's uncle owns
 a honeymoon resort in Khandala

213
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,173
"Rajiv, you're too naive, son"

214
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:04,431
"If you need my help anytime,
 don't hesitate to ask me"

215
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,184
Okay Dad

216
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:24,743
"What time was it supposed to be aired?
 - 12:30, Dad"

217
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:29,080
I guess they cancelled it.
 I'm feeling sleepy. Good night

218
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,210
"I'll call you if it comes up.
 - No, you watch it. I'm off to sleep"

219
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,758
Mohenjo-Daro! The animals too
 must've been buried by now

220
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:05,533
I'll tell you. The babe in it
 was so damn sexy... so damn sexy...

221
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:10,080
"she could put all our actresses
 to shame, I swear"

222
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,167
Get off it. Don't rub salts

223
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:19,047
"The canteen is full. Find a table,
 while I get some snacks"

224
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,259
Swine

225
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,857
"Reserved?
 - No, sit"

226
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:47,158
What's up?
 - Writing notes for a friend

227
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:51,705
Still hooked on social work?
 - Maybe I picked it up writing for you

228
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,879
Where was I?

229
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,132
"What's up? Tuitions, eh?
 - Oh no"

230
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:06,302
"Obviously, man. Teacher Payal
 is sitting before him with books"

231
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:11,224
"If not tuition, you think
 it's going to be Fashion TV?"

232
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:20,108
What's up?

233
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:30,493
She's studying. Let her be

234
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:34,539
Something's fishy

235
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,754
Did shopping for the Traditional Day?
 - I bought a lovely dress

236
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:44,174
Really?

237
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,394
What's come over my heart?

238
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,356
Where am I lost?

239
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,192
"Why do I see the moon
 during daytime?"

240
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:05,695
"Why do I feel
 it's raining in summer?"

241
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:09,991
"Why does this feeling arise
 every now and then?"

242
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:16,164
Is this what they call love?

243
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:27,318
Now that I have spun a new dream...

244
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:32,323
this world seems to have changed

245
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:39,330
Never did I feel like this before

246
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,627
"What passion is it
 that rises in me?"

247
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,798
This moment seems to be intoxicated

248
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,801
And the skies seems to bow

249
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,804
My lips...

250
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,141
"though silent,
 reveal a new tale"

251
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:02,520
My heartbeats too are upbeat

252
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:08,651
"Why does this feeling arise
 every now and then?"

253
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,476
In the mirror...

254
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,187
when I saw myself...

255
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:49,359
"I blushed
 and my gaze lowered"

256
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:53,488
I skipped...

257
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,366
a heartbeat

258
00:26:56,366 --> 00:27:01,496
For a moment I went breathless

259
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,583
"And now,
 my bangles torment me..."

260
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,545
keep me awake at nights

261
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,506
I'm more restless now

262
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,676
I'm changing bit by bit

263
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:19,055
"I don't know
 what makes me so anxious"

264
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:25,145
Is this what they call love?

265
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,776
"Why does this feeling arise
 every now and then?"

266
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,032
Is this what they call love?

267
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:49,127
Who are they greeting?
 - Not us. Never mind

268
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:53,214
"My outfit is a perfect air-conditioner.
 Anyway, how is Kamla?"

269
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:56,718
He's so possessive!

270
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:13,735
"Where did you pick
 that lovely outfit from, Payal?"

271
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,658
It's Payal! I almost failed
 to recognize you

272
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,662
Right. My word

273
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:30,710
"Payal, shall I tell you something?
 Rajiv is a dunce"

274
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:37,300
"In case you and Rahul don't
 get up close, just remember me"

275
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:52,691
If she gets the right guidance she'll
 undergo a complete change in one month

276
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:57,070
"Javed, you got to announce something.
 - Oh yes"

277
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,613
Hear this

278
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:01,032
"After two months, my parents
 are on going on a world tour"

279
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:03,993
So what?
 - We can party...

280
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,664
at our beach house in Alibaug.
 - Do you really mean it?

281
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:12,961
I mean it. For a couple of days.
 It'll be fun

282
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,549
The two of you are also invited

283
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:26,307
"Damn!
 - As usual, impossible for us"

284
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:32,188
"Got to do something, buddy.
 Our reputation is at stake"

285
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:36,526
Is your phone number 6395795?

286
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,652
Yours?

287
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:40,655
Yours?

288
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:45,076
How could it be?
 Because it's my number

289
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:50,248
"I mean, 6395795
 is my telephone number"

290
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,302
Find a solution to our problem!
 - For Alibaug...

291
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,721
We need a girlfriend.
 - One?

292
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,223
"All right, one for him too.
 - Why does he need one?"

293
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,267
He already has one waiting for him.
 - Who?

294
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:12,103
"Payal.
 - I told you, didn't I?"

295
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:14,773
I'm tired of telling him that

296
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:17,817
"Rocky...
 - Fall in line, man"

297
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,779
"Mambo, you've been blacklisted
 for poor attendance"

298
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,655
Damn!
 - Then I should also be blacklisted

299
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,408
"Impossible. Payal acts
 as your proxy, after all"

300
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:30,789
"I told you! Stay here, I'm off.
 - Go on"

301
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,793
See how multipurpose is your
 girlfriend? There's no time. So think

302
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:38,838
You won't lose any time in wooing her.
 - No Rocky. Payal is not my type

303
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:42,884
She might be expecting that we
 fall in love seriously with each other

304
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:46,721
"But no, thanks. I wish to stay away
 from love and its labor"

305
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:51,685
"Sonny, just woo her. After you've
 had enough just show her the door"

306
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:57,399
Quite tough. She won't give in.
 And her looks... so simple

307
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:02,696
If you wish you can give Payal a new
 look. Remember the Traditional Day?

308
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:05,323
You won't make a mockery of yourself.
 She'll look good

309
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,450
"With girls,
 I'm never wrong"

310
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,495
No. She might get serious with me
 and be a pain in my neck

311
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,789
"You're concerned
 only with Alibaug, no?"

312
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,751
"Woo her first. After you return,
 dump her"

313
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,796
How do I put it before her?

314
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:23,800
Get her to the garden
 in ten minutes. I'll train you

315
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,845
She is a decent girl.
 - You aren't bad either. Know Kabir?

316
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,222
Which class is he in?
 - The poet Kabir

317
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:33,518
"Do it today, not tomorrow.
 Do it now, not today"

318
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,816
"Twice yes?
 - I said, sir"

319
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,318
You're from my class?
 - Yes sir. Rajiv Mathur

320
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:47,365
Strange. Never seen you before

321
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:53,663
Full attendance. I guess
 you have a dear friend in this class

322
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,250
"Not a friend sir, a girlfriend!"

323
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,295
Damn you!

324
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:12,515
"Do it today, not tomorrow.
 Do it now, not today"

325
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,769
Now!

326
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:20,774
Now?
 - I need to talk to you. It's urgent

327
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:26,446
What is it?
 - Can't tell you here. Outside

328
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,824
Now!
 - Now...?

329
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:35,121
"Yes. Do it today, not tomorrow.
 Do it now, not today"

330
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:38,750
Know poet Kabir...?

331
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,179
"Payal, he is right.
 We're disturbing the entire class"

332
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:06,528
Know what? For the first time
 I have bunked a lecture

333
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:11,408
"Where the hell is Rocky?
 - It's strange, but it feels good"

334
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,746
Out of the blue! What's come
 over him? Why did he call me...?

335
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:20,291
Actually Payal...

336
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:23,503
well...

337
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,089
"It's my first time, that's why
 I'm not able to speak it out..."

338
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:29,843
What is it? There is something you
 want to tell me that makes you nervous

339
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:34,472
"Come on Rajiv, you've known me
 for years. Out with it. What is it?"

340
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,772
Must be some Dolly or Saloni
 in mini-skirts

341
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:45,525
I don't know how and when it happened.
 But I'm sure it's love

342
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:49,279
"So, who is it?
 - No one... no one"

343
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,159
No one? What do you mean?
 - There's no one behind that tree

344
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:59,330
"Come on Rajiv,
 this is no time to joke"

345
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:04,586
"So tell me, who is she...?
 - What?"

346
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:10,759
"I mean, it's you Payal"

347
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:15,347
"What...?
 - I mean it, Payal. I love you"

348
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:18,058
Where are they?
 - Who?

349
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:22,354
Your flunkies. I know they are
 hiding and watching this farce

350
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,065
"No Payal...
 - You are pulling my leg, right?"

351
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,776
Cook up!

352
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:33,031
"No Payal, I mean it.
 Actually, I always felt for you"

353
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,203
"But I deliberately avoided it,
 because I never wanted to fall in love"

354
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:43,166
"But the truth is, the more I held back,
 the more the feelings rose for you"

355
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,794
The swine is a natural!

356
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:48,713
"Rajiv, I... you..."

357
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:52,842
"Tell me honestly, Payal.
 You love me, don't you?"

358
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:57,305
I'm in love with you.
 But I don't know since when

359
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:01,518
"But I was afraid,
 maybe you chose not me..."

360
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:06,940
"but the likes of Dolly and Saloni,
 modern and bold"

361
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:12,237
I still don't believe
 that you love me

362
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:37,595
"Those eyes,
 those sweet words you speak..."

363
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,724
ruined my sleep...

364
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,852
robbed my peace...

365
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:46,813
invaded my dreams...

366
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,858
and made me belong to you

367
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,819
Made me belong to you...

368
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,780
invaded my dreams...

369
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,827
and slowly taught me love

370
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:06,666
"By and by you snatched
 the peace of my heart"

371
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:21,157
In thoughts of you...

372
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:24,452
I spend my days and nights

373
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,163
This world...

374
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:30,166
is a farce without you

375
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,836
How I pine...

376
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,755
how do I tell you?

377
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:41,011
"I can't forget you
 even for a moment"

378
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:45,348
"All day, all night..."

379
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,809
my heart...

380
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:53,106
expects you. Why?

381
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:58,528
"Slowly and gently
 you snatched my peace"

382
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:26,973
My friend is no more a friend...

383
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:33,104
"What's up, smarty?
 - Smart alec!"

384
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:38,151
"I've seen it all. What's happening?
 - Nothing serious, Mambo"

385
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:43,365
"Shut up. I'm talking to you, madam.
 How do I address you henceforth?"

386
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:47,744
Payal? Or Sister-in-law?

387
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,592
"You wooed her, and you
 didn't even tell me?"

388
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:07,597
Are you mad? Would I forget you?
 That too for Payal?

389
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,975
"Don't lie. After the two of you hit
 it off, forget going out with me..."

390
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:14,646
you haven't even called me up.
 That's a mean friend!

391
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,692
"Mambo, this is temporary.
 It's only a matter of few days"

392
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:24,030
What do you mean?
 - The setup is all for Alibaug

393
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:27,992
No wonder all of a sudden
 you got Payal...

394
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:31,996
No! Payal isn't that type.
 - We're concerned only about Alibaug

395
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,749
"After that, bye-bye"

396
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:39,504
Payal won't allow you to do anything.
 - I know. I'm still holding her arms

397
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,723
May I have this?
 - Put it down!

398
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:53,518
Can we also play?

399
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:01,651
"We heard everything. You and Payal
 have it going, don't you?"

400
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:04,070
Who told you?
 - I...? Nope

401
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,450
"Pal, try your best,
 but you can't hide a pimple and love"

402
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:12,912
Oh no. Payal is not my type.
 She's hundred percent nun

403
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:16,207
"Why must you compare me with her?
 Don't insult me, guys"

404
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:19,127
I still can't believe
 it's all happening with me

405
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:23,798
"What feelings I have for Rajiv,
 the same he has for me"

406
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:32,265
Maybe she's content with the rumors
 if not for an affair

407
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:37,354
Could be. Why don't we
 ask Payal herself?

408
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:47,697
"Tell us something, Payal"

409
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:50,867
So you guys have it going?
 - Yes. Why do you ask?

410
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:56,706
Just checking. Because Rajiv
 just said that it's all rubbish

411
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:12,055
I ought to worship you guys

412
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:17,602
Imagine Rajiv with me! You can't
 link him to me and insult him

413
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:22,857
You guys know that I'm not his type.
 Right Mambo?

414
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:27,320
"And I am... well, what am I called?
 - Nun"

415
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,740
"And a nun can't be
 a girlfriend, right?"

416
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,537
I've been asked this question thrice
 since morning. I'm tired of saying no

417
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:40,083
Finally I decided to say yes
 if I am asked again

418
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:44,421
"Dolly, I think I got to put
 a placard around my neck saying..."

419
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:48,842
"Nothing's going on between
 Rajiv and Payal"

420
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,177
"Bye, I'm getting late"

421
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:56,766
"By the way Rajiv,
 I did not spread the rumors"

422
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:03,106
What have you done?
 - I messed

423
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:07,193
"I warned you against doing it.
 - Don't chide me, please. Let me think"

424
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,697
Go and placate her

425
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:13,742
Go!

426
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:24,419
"Please Rajiv, I don't want to talk.
 Go away, please"

427
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:30,258
Please! Don't say sorry. A sorry can't
 make up for a deliberate mistake

428
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,804
Please listen to me.
 - I don't want to hear a thing

429
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:39,309
Know why I didn't want
 to tell them about us...?

430
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:46,358
"I wanted to give them a surprise
 in the end, Payal"

431
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:53,114
"Look, I don't know much about love.
 All I know is, true love is not hidden"

432
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:56,701
Payal what I did was
 maybe my weakness

433
00:42:56,701 --> 00:43:01,373
"And, I could never do
 what you did for me back there"

434
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:11,257
"All right, if you don't believe me,
 come with me"

435
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:27,107
Meet her. Payal.
 My girlfriend

436
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:32,487
"From now on, no one teases her.
 And no one calls a nun anymore"

437
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:44,874
Are you okay?
 - Yes

438
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:51,131
"Not near my building!
 If my Daddy sees, he'll bash us up"

439
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:54,175
Goodness!

440
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,057
Scared?
 - No... I'm not

441
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:06,062
I know you in and out.
 Bye now

442
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,276
Are you crazy?

443
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:24,581
Madcap

444
00:44:24,664 --> 00:44:28,168
"Priya, open the door"

445
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:31,087
Hi aunt. This is Payal.
 - Hi Payal. How are you?

446
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:34,299
I'm fine.
 - It's been long since you came over

447
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:38,470
I will certainly come.
 How are Priya and uncle?

448
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:41,097
All are fine. How about Bittu?
 - He's fine

449
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:45,477
Here... talk to Rajiv.
 - Who is it?

450
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:53,151
Thank God you aren't angry.
 I thought you wouldn't talk to me

451
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:57,113
Nothing of the sort.
 Hang on

452
00:44:57,113 --> 00:44:59,783
You want to speak to her?
 - No. Why?

453
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:04,704
No. You mind if I...?
 - Oh! All right

454
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:08,375
Tell me fast. I don't have time.
 - What's this sudden change?

455
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:12,587
Yes. Tell me.
 - I just called to say sorry

456
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,758
So say it fast and hang up.
 I have other things to do

457
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:22,681
Over? Shall I hang up now?
 - No... I wanted to tell you something

458
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:28,061
Hold the receiver close to your ears

459
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:31,106
Speak

460
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:33,608
Stupid! Are you crazy?
 What if someone hears?

461
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:36,778
No one can hear!
 I'm home alone!

462
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,655
How come?
 - My parents...

463
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:42,325
have gone for a housewarming.
 - I'm coming over

464
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:43,785
"No!
 - No, no..."

465
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:46,121
"Rajiv, you are not coming.
 - A girl's denial is consent, I know"

466
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:49,290
I'm coming

467
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:59,801
Rajiv! You're mad!
 You've really turned up?

468
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:02,012
Come on inside

469
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:07,475
The house is a changed place!
 Hi Chikki...

470
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,022
"Not here, Rajiv!
 Let's go inside!"

471
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:18,028
"If the neighbour sees us together,
 it'll hit the headlines tomorrow"

472
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,029
C'mon!

473
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:22,365
"I thought you were kidding, Rajiv.
 And you really landed up?"

474
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:26,786
Not there... get up!

475
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:29,164
You don't know what sort
 of neighbours we have

476
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:32,375
What sort?
 - They're mad like you

477
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,419
Where are you going?
 - To fetch some water

478
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:38,048
Never mind. Come back here

479
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,384
Did you miss me?
 - What will you do if I told you?

480
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:45,055
It's just for my information.
 - You don't need such information

481
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:47,182
Now tell me... please

482
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:50,101
"Yes, I did.
 - How much?"

483
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,771
This much.
 - Is that all?

484
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:55,440
"All right, this much.
 - That's all?"

485
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,153
This much?

486
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:03,031
"Rajiv, what are you doing?"

487
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:07,410
"Okay, I won't touch you"

488
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:19,381
Won't you give me something to drink?
 - What will you have? Coffee? Tea?

489
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,717
Nothing else?

490
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:08,013
Why did you touch my personal
 diary without asking me?

491
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:10,098
"You know, I don't let
 anyone..."

492
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:15,311
"Since when, Payal...?
 I had no inkling"

493
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:35,457
"Neither does my fear go away,
 nor do I get any sleep..."

494
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:41,004
"nor even do I find peace
 for a moment"

495
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:46,593
"Neither am I in my senses,
 nor are you in yours..."

496
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:51,598
"I wonder what intoxication
 overwhelms us"

497
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:58,355
It makes us pine thus

498
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,125
What are we going to do?
 - There's someone at the door

499
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:30,595
My folks! They're back!

500
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:37,394
Go and open the door

501
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:41,398
Must I? Are you sure?

502
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,070
"How long did you take, Payal?
 We've been ringing the doorbell"

503
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,531
"You're back very early, Papa?
 - There was no traffic on the roads"

504
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:52,075
Why did you take such a long time
 to open the door?

505
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:55,745
"I had plugged in the walkman,
 I couldn't hear the bell"

506
00:49:55,745 --> 00:50:00,458
Something surely is fishy.
 - Nothing except you is fishy

507
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:09,384
No...

508
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,101
There's no one

509
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,478
Your brains are rotting watching
 all those silly programmes on TV

510
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:25,150
Your teeth will rot too.
 Brush your teeth and go to bed

511
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:27,944
Where...?
 - Near the window!

512
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:29,779
Over here

513
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:32,615
What are you doing?
 - Nothing will happen

514
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:35,452
Have you gone mad...?

515
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,496
"Here's the offering, Payal. You ought
 to have gone with us"

516
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:40,331
Everyone was asking about you

517
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:43,293
It was such a lovely house. We almost
 fell when we saw the bathroom

518
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:47,797
"Go away, lady...
 else, I'll fall"

519
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:51,593
I've got work to do

520
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:55,680
Payal...
 - Coming!

521
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,693
"As usual, they must be out bowling.
 Where else will they go?"

522
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:17,118
"Why aren't you eating
 something, Payal?"

523
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:20,121
"Thanks, but I'm fasting.
 - At least have some wafers"

524
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:22,123
"No, I can't eat wafers either.
 - A soft drink?"

525
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:24,209
I can't even drink water.
 - You talk as if you were...

526
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:29,464
"fasting for your husband's long life!
 - Quite an idea, you bet"

527
00:51:30,131 --> 00:51:33,760
Imagine fasting for the spouse!
 For him? No way

528
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,305
What are you saying?
 - It's so stupid!

529
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:40,475
It isn't stupid at all.
 Actually I can say that...

530
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:44,688
because I know how nice I'm feeling.
 - You mean...

531
00:51:45,146 --> 00:51:48,191
you're really fasting for
 your spouse's long life?

532
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:52,237
"For whom?
 - Stupid! For Rajiv, obviously"

533
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:56,741
Why would she fast for you?
 - Nobody fasts for me anyway

534
00:51:56,741 --> 00:52:00,745
Take a lesson from her. Love isn't
 just going to the discos and parties

535
00:52:00,745 --> 00:52:03,373
This is part of it too.
 - Lucky guy

536
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:09,170
"If I'm not wrong, you end your fast
 when your spouse feeds you. Right?"

537
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,050
"In that case, I'll be coming over.
 - Why? You're not my husband"

538
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,053
And my parents will be there.
 - So?

539
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:21,766
I'll still come. Just you see

540
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:04,100
I'll still come. Just you see

541
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:12,275
Hello lady!

542
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:14,694
"Rajiv, you've really landed here!"

543
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:18,073
I come with here with
 so much of difficulty...

544
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:21,159
and you don't even look at me?
 - Actually...

545
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,411
I thought I was imagining things

546
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:25,747
"Now that I'm here,
 let's get started"

547
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:30,126
What's this?
 - Not like that. Come with me

548
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:36,132
"What did Mummy do first...?
 Yes, the little ritual"

549
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:40,512
Do it properly

550
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:43,390
How much will you do?
 That's enough

551
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,435
Now... the vermillion

552
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:53,733
Water!

553
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:01,700
That's it!
 - Feed me! I've eaten nothing

554
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,036
Eat tomorrow

555
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,836
Touch my feet

556
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:16,881
Complete the ritual

557
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:21,469
"May you live long,
 may your husband live long"

558
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:25,724
May you have a hundred sons

559
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:32,647
"You don't know how much
 all this means to me, Rajiv"

560
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:37,235
This isn't just a ritual...
 it's my love for you

561
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:43,616
And whatever happens...
 I'll always want you to be happy

562
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:51,166
And may you always find
 what you seek

563
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:58,131
"Payal, what are you doing in there?
 - Your mother!"

564
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:02,052
I'm changing!
 - They won't let us enjoy any peace

565
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:05,013
"Rajiv, go away"

566
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:07,223
We'll complete the rest of
 the action in Alibaug. Okay?

567
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:09,184
Who's going?
 - You

568
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:11,061
No way! Impossible!

569
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:14,189
An overnight picnic...?
 - Why not?

570
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:18,401
You think Papa will permit me?
 No way!

571
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:23,114
What are we going to do?

572
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:42,425
Say yes!
 - All right. Let's try

573
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:46,471
Be quick with whatever you do

574
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:53,728
I'll be back

575
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:59,693
"So what's happening, lover-boy?
 You've been climbing pipes, I hear?"

576
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,987
You said you didn't want any love
 and romance. So what gives?

577
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:05,407
There's nothing of the sort.
 It's simply...

578
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,410
Your face says it all.
 You're in love

579
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,247
"Why must you lie to Rocky?
 - There's nothing of the sort, Rocky"

580
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:17,711
Forget everything else.
 Go away to Alibaug

581
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:30,432
I'll talk to you later

582
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:34,728
"Please, Uncle. It's only
 for two days"

583
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:39,024
"Two days or three, my daughter isn't
 staying away from home in the night"

584
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:46,281
Our parents have said that we'll get
 the permission only if Payal goes

585
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:49,826
"Why is that?
 - It's all about trust, Uncle"

586
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:53,663
Our folks trust Payal
 more than they trust us

587
00:56:53,663 --> 00:56:57,542
They are amazed at the values
 she has imbibed

588
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:02,172
"Obviously, all the credit
 goes to her parents"

589
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,010
"What do you say, Payal?
 - I won't be going if you object, Papa"

590
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,680
Good. Don't go then

591
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:14,684
All right. Go ahead

592
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:25,362
What say?
 - You guys are so late

593
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:27,030
"Mambo, aren't you coming?"

594
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,492
You don't have a girl.
 How will you join us?

595
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:34,579
"Should we take him along, girls?"

596
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:43,421
"All right, I'll come"

597
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,652
Immersed

598
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:11,032
"My heart is immersed
 in your eyes"

599
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:18,289
"My heart is immersed
 in your eyes"

600
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:24,129
You're a beauty...

601
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:28,174
of my making

602
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:30,635
You're my beloved

603
00:58:30,635 --> 00:58:36,766
"Your heart is immersed
 in my eyes"

604
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:42,647
You aren't Romeo...

605
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:46,776
nor are you Majnu

606
00:58:46,776 --> 00:58:50,697
You're a big wonder

607
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,731
You and I...

608
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,108
make a love-story

609
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:31,738
"Don't you ever forget it,
 make sure"

610
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:34,032
You're a virgin

611
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:36,409
I'm a virgin

612
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:39,037
"To you, I've lost my heart"

613
00:59:39,037 --> 00:59:41,206
Come closer to me

614
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:45,502
If I don't have you...

615
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:50,382
I won't have another man

616
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:55,053
"My heart is immersed
 in your eyes"

617
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:59,599
"Your heart is immersed
 in my eyes"

618
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,476
You're a beauty...

619
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:04,062
of my making

620
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:06,231
"You aren't Romeo,
 nor are you Majnu"

621
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:10,276
You're a big wonder

622
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:24,749
You ought to have
 looked at his face!

623
01:00:33,508 --> 01:00:36,594
See the expression
 on our hero's face?

624
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:39,597
He won't even touch her
 for fear of doing something wrong

625
01:00:39,597 --> 01:00:42,934
No sweat

626
01:00:54,237 --> 01:00:57,615
Sit down

627
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,084
"Know what, Rajiv? I always dreamed
 of things turning out like this"

628
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:12,797
You and me... far away
 from home like this

629
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:16,551
I can't believe it's
 all really happening

630
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:20,430
"Yes, me too"

631
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:24,601
"Rajiv, there's a question I've
 been wanting to ask you"

632
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:30,482
Go ahead.
 - Look at me

633
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:37,572
What was it about me that you...

634
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:43,119
"You don't need a reason
 to fall in love, stupid"

635
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,248
"I don't think you need a reason.
 - Oh yes, we do"

636
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:52,170
"Several reasons, in fact"

637
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:57,175
So tell me. What did
 you like about me?

638
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:02,472
You love to show off

639
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:05,141
But you have a very nice heart

640
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:09,062
"Know what, Rajiv?
 I can blindly trust you"

641
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:12,315
I'm sure you will never
 betray my trust

642
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:14,150
And there's something
 I didn't tell you

643
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:18,822
I haven't seen anyone climb
 the pipes like you do!

644
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,704
Your turn now

645
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:30,291
It's your ears... that take
 my voice to you

646
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:35,255
"Your beauty,
 your hair..."

647
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,466
your back...

648
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:43,179
I'm telling you
 what I like about you

649
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:46,391
"What are you doing, Rajiv...?"

650
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:50,437
"Stop it, Rajiv!
 Have you gone mad?"

651
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:53,231
"What's wrong with this, Payal?"

652
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:55,817
"One moment, Rajiv... cool down"

653
01:02:55,817 --> 01:03:00,905
"I love you, Payal! Are you mad?
 - I love you too, but..."

654
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:05,702
"Let me go, please!"

655
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:11,499
"Stop it! This isn't right, okay?
 - So why did I bring you here?"

656
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:21,009
I understand! You pretended to be
 in love with me...

657
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,346
so I'd come here and
 you would...

658
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:28,099
"I can see the truth now, Rajiv"

659
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:30,310
Ever since you planned this
 trip to Alibaug...

660
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:33,855
you started this drama
 of love with me

661
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:37,192
And what a fool I was!
 I couldn't see through you!

662
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:41,780
"Even in my house the other day,
 you tried to force yourself on me!"

663
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,450
And I was so blind!
 I refused to believe...

664
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:49,579
it was my body you were after!

665
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:51,790
Who do you think you are?

666
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,376
I can find a thousand girls like you
 to fall in love with

667
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:56,461
But I don't want these
 hassles of love

668
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:58,797
I thought we'd have a nice time
 in Alibaug and soon forget it

669
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:02,550
But you have other plans!
 As for the rest of them...

670
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:05,720
"they called you a nun! I'm the one
 who gave you a standard, a level"

671
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,724
Who do you think you are?

672
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:20,777
What are you guys staring at?

673
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:28,868
No. There's no need to make
 either her or me see reason

674
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:31,746
I did what I thought was right
 and she did was she thought was right

675
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:34,082
"C'mon, guys.
 We're no kids"

676
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:35,959
Actually...

677
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,461
"I forgot to tell
 you something, Payal"

678
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:42,674
Danny had laced Rajiv's drink
 with something. And...

679
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:49,139
"he had lost his senses,
 he didn't know what he was doing"

680
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:53,810
"Now look, Rajiv. If your ego
 doesn't permit you to bow..."

681
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,855
we can always ask Payal
 to say sorry to you

682
01:04:56,855 --> 01:05:01,151
"Right. She was the one
 who took offense, isn't it?"

683
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,362
So what if she took offense?
 Who created the situation?

684
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:06,531
It's his mistake!
 - All right...

685
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:10,827
who led him by the hand anyway?
 - Really?

686
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:36,061
The hero and the heroine are here.
 Let the extras move on

687
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:40,106
"Yes, wait here, all of you"

688
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:47,197
"Rajiv, I was a bit..."

689
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:49,074
"You ought to have
 thought of it then, Payal"

690
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:53,036
"But it all happened so suddenly,
 I had no time to think"

691
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,872
And you insulted me. You slapped me
 in everybody's presence

692
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:59,834
"And you spoke any nonsense
 you wanted to, right?"

693
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:02,962
I wasn't just a roadside thug either

694
01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:04,798
Whatever I did was because
 I took you for my own

695
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:09,386
And what did you give me in return?

696
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:14,140
What happened that day
 can happen every now and then

697
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,850
"How can you say that, Rajiv?"

698
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:18,728
It's because this wall is
 going to stand between us

699
01:06:18,728 --> 01:06:22,399
"What's gotten into you, Rajiv?
 - Why? Do you feel bad?"

700
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:25,402
"All right, if you think there's
 no wall between us..."

701
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:28,697
"right now, in everybody's presence..."

702
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,740
kiss me

703
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,368
Have you gone mad?
 - Why?

704
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:38,123
She can slap me in everybody's presence
 but she can't kiss me?

705
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:43,086
"Forget it, Payal"

706
01:06:56,057 --> 01:06:58,393
My love isn't so weak.
 I don't have to do something...

707
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:02,355
so cheap to prove it's worth

708
01:07:03,606 --> 01:07:09,154
See? I told you.
 But you guys wouldn't listen

709
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:15,785
"Rajiv, this isn't right.
 You're going to regret this"

710
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:18,079
He'll go without a girl
 all his life

711
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,790
What do you think? You'll find
 a better girl than Payal?

712
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,418
You guys are flying because
 you've got girlfriends?

713
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:26,087
"All right, but remember..."

714
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:31,343
"some day, the most beautiful girl
 in college will be with me"

715
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:58,703
Name?

716
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:11,091
"Hurry, she'll go away!"

717
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:16,346
Wait... what's up?
 - What a gal!

718
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:18,682
Who...?
 - She's too much

719
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:22,352
She's at the principal's office.
 Everyone's floored!

720
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:25,939
Floored...?

721
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:48,336
Who is she?

722
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:50,964
Who is she?

723
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:53,341
"Who's she
 with the pearl eyes?"

724
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:55,885
"Who's she with
 the golden hair?"

725
01:08:55,885 --> 01:08:58,346
"Who's she with
 the silvery body?"

726
01:08:58,346 --> 01:09:00,974
"Who's she with the
 provocative gait?"

727
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:05,020
Who's she...?

728
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:12,318
"A million faces I've seen,
 none of them I remember"

729
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:16,990
"The moment she arrives,
 every other face fades away"

730
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:21,870
"What stuff is she made of?
 What's her name?"

731
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:28,501
"Where does she live?
 What's she into?"

732
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,532
"She sports a red scarf,
 high-heeled shoes..."

733
01:09:59,532 --> 01:10:02,369
and a silk top

734
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:06,748
"I've never seen
 anything like this before"

735
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:11,002
"Talk to this fairy
 from a distance"

736
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:15,674
You might offend her

737
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:46,121
Every heart beats for me...

738
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,707
every lip thirsts for me

739
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:53,128
"They're crazy for my love,
 my love is what they seek"

740
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:57,757
"I possess the charm
 and the mischief"

741
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:00,677
"I hold sway
 over every heart"

742
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:04,931
"A million beauties there might be,
 but there isn't one like me"

743
01:11:05,724 --> 01:11:10,061
"So many young boys
 have gone crazy after me"

744
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:14,607
I cast a spell with my beauty

745
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:19,696
"He who casts a look at me
 is enthralled"

746
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:22,824
"Who's she
 with the pearl eyes?"

747
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:25,326
"Who's she with
 the golden hair?"

748
01:11:25,326 --> 01:11:27,829
"Who's she with
 the silvery body?"

749
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:30,915
"Who's she with the
 provocative gait?"

750
01:11:30,915 --> 01:11:34,919
Who's she...?

751
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,804
In a world of your dreams!

752
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:48,016
"Boss, stop thinking of her"

753
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:51,811
"She's rich, out of reach...
 and I'm sure... a bitch"

754
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:55,106
"Forget all this and patch
 it up with Payal, Rajiv"

755
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:57,025
What's that about Payal?

756
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:59,110
"Rajiv, you don't know
 how lucky you are"

757
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:03,031
"Let me tell you, Rajiv.
 In love, you can't..."

758
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,450
What love...?

759
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:08,036
You're going to teach me
 about love? You?

760
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:10,789
No girl even looks at you

761
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:16,419
"And you'll teach me about love...?
 No, don't teach me about love. Okay?"

762
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:28,890
"Sachin, where's Rocky?
 - I don't know"

763
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:38,566
"You'll know say, "I'm sorry" and
 I'll say, "It's okay"

764
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:42,362
"And you'll say, Im really very sorry
 and I'll say, "It's fine"

765
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:47,742
"But since you're not saying a word,
 let me say it"

766
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:03,883
She was right!

767
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:08,346
"Now, that's a real item.
 Isn't she?"

768
01:13:08,346 --> 01:13:10,432
How about Payal? Is it all over?
 - Yes

769
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:14,352
Never mind. I did my best.
 - Tell me something about this girl

770
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:17,355
"I'll get the dope on her,
 but it'll take some time"

771
01:13:17,355 --> 01:13:22,360
"I can't wait much longer, Rocky.
 When we ran into each other just now..."

772
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,947
we were so close! I couldn't
 take my eyes off her face

773
01:13:25,947 --> 01:13:30,368
How much time will it take?
 - Can't say. But your job will be done

774
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:32,954
Where's Mambo?
 - Forget about him

775
01:13:32,954 --> 01:13:35,623
"Mohit, you wanted details
 on Jyotika, didn't you?"

776
01:13:35,623 --> 01:13:39,044
No! She has become so fat!

777
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:42,797
"Look at him! After all my hard work,
 waste of time and energy...!"

778
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:47,052
"You won't act like him, will you?
 - No, Rocky. I'm not stepping back"

779
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:52,390
"Whatever happens, Rocky.
 I want Alisha"

780
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:57,479
"Rajiv, where's Payal?
 - I don't know"

781
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:01,691
She doesn't telephone
 nor come to my house

782
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:04,319
Name your business.
 - Here you are

783
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,821
What's this?
 - Payal's book. She gave it to me

784
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:11,034
It was with me for many days. Return
 it to her and say sorry on my behalf

785
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:14,329
I must say sorry to Payal?
 She's not meeting me

786
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:18,583
But the two of you
 are in the same college!

787
01:14:21,127 --> 01:14:23,421
This ghost of Payal refuses
 to be exorcised!

788
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:44,776
One mistake I made...

789
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:51,700
I fell in love with you

790
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:57,122
Secretly...

791
01:14:57,163 --> 01:15:00,583
I cried...

792
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:05,672
"you gave me
 so much of sorrow"

793
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:15,724
"O ignorant, wicked one..."

794
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:19,060
inflict every tyranny on me

795
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:22,731
My love for you will never lessen

796
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:26,735
"I swear it on the tears
 I shed for you"

797
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:32,782
I have truly loved you

798
01:16:07,525 --> 01:16:10,362
Father's name: Harshvardhan Sahay.
 Mother's name Radhika Sahay

799
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:12,697
Name of father's current wife:
 Anjali Sahay

800
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:14,783
Name of mother's current boyfriend:
 Sunil Arora

801
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:18,870
Tell me about Alisha. Please

802
01:16:21,956 --> 01:16:25,043
Rich. She has won the
 beauty contest thrice

803
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:30,298
The most important fact. Her favorite
 sportsman is... Sachin Tendulkar

804
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:34,427
I can't tell you how crazy
 she is about him

805
01:16:34,427 --> 01:16:38,515
Sachin dominates every place!

806
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:42,686
"In short, there's just
 one of getting to Alisha"

807
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:44,771
What?
 - Sachin

808
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,648
Stop kidding and tell me
 what we're going to do

809
01:16:46,648 --> 01:16:49,818
Let's have a word with Sachin.
 I do know him

810
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,821
My postman's nephew
 is Sachin's liftman

811
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:55,490
I don't think this
 connection is working

812
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:56,991
There is a way.
 - What?

813
01:16:56,991 --> 01:17:00,453
Let's think

814
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:07,669
"If my boss gets to know,
 I'm going to be fired"

815
01:17:11,339 --> 01:17:13,508
It's for just ten minutes

816
01:17:13,508 --> 01:17:17,429
Drop him at the
 first bus stop you see

817
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:20,348
Doesn't such a great cricketer
 have a car?

818
01:17:20,348 --> 01:17:23,309
"Tax problems, you see. No wonder
 he's traveling in buses"

819
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:28,023
I saw Agarkar going on foot too

820
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:31,026
See my palm and tell me.
 Will I score a century?

821
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:33,778
"Let her come.
 - Sorry, this is my first time"

822
01:17:33,778 --> 01:17:38,366
My first time too. I've never
 pulled off a bigger stunt

823
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:41,870
Sachin!

824
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,955
Wow! What a piece!

825
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:47,083
See my palm and tell me.
 Will I score a century?

826
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:52,047
"Your stars are pretty strong,
 but there's a problem"

827
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,424
Alisha! Your classmate's
 reading Sachin's palm!

828
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,968
Know what?
 Open the innings

829
01:17:56,968 --> 01:18:00,847
He knows Sachin!

830
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:11,775
"Sorry, I forgot.
 - Happens when you have a fleet of cars"

831
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:18,573
Did you get the dough?
 - Yes. Rocky already gave it to me

832
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:22,911
See you

833
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:26,456
"I ought to be moving, Sachin"

834
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:29,459
Don't put on airs.
 It will make a difference to me

835
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:34,673
"I'll try, but do as I said
 and you'll have good results. Okay?"

836
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:37,926
Say hi to your wife and tell her
 I'm coming over for lunch

837
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:40,387
You always say that but
 you don't really come over

838
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:43,932
I'll surely come. Bye

839
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:55,694
He's gone

840
01:18:55,694 --> 01:19:00,573
Never mind. I'll catch up with him
 at the college tomorrow

841
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:06,871
Do you know Rajiv Mathur?

842
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:15,005
God! She's looking at me!
 She wants to talk to me...

843
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:19,718
"the secret isn't out, is it?
 Let me see"

844
01:19:21,052 --> 01:19:24,347
Have you seen Rajiv Mathur around?
 - Rajiv...?

845
01:19:24,347 --> 01:19:27,684
No

846
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:35,316
Rajiv! Your work is done!
 She's looking for you!

847
01:19:35,316 --> 01:19:39,320
Our formula is a hit!
 She's pining for you

848
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,323
"No, at the right time!
 Let the iron get hotter"

849
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:45,827
And then... strike!

850
01:19:47,495 --> 01:19:51,041
What happened?
 - Payal!

851
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,544
Have you seen Rajiv around?
 Rajiv Mathur?

852
01:19:54,544 --> 01:19:58,590
"No, I've just arrived.
 He must be around somewhere"

853
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:01,968
He has come to the college.
 - How do you know?

854
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:05,930
His bike's out there

855
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:11,770
"You even know his bike number?
 - Yes, because..."

856
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:19,402
I've been looking for you!

857
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:24,741
"You're taking part in the
 cultural festival, aren't you?"

858
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:29,371
I'm interested in dancing too.
 - Really?

859
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:33,416
Can I come to your rehearsals?

860
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:37,420
"Rajiv, when are they starting?
 - Come over from tomorrow"

861
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:40,382
I'll surely come

862
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:46,346
"By the way, I saw Sachin Tendulkar
 at the Club yesterday"

863
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:52,727
Really?
 - What's interesting is that...

864
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:56,856
there was this boy with him
 who looked just like you

865
01:20:56,856 --> 01:21:00,360
Shit! I told him we shouldn't
 meet at the club!

866
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,823
"That's a secret.
 Please don't tell anyone, okay?"

867
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:12,080
"Actually, Sachin and I have played
 cricket together since we were kids"

868
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,918
"I must be half his age, but he was
 crazy about my square-cut"

869
01:21:17,752 --> 01:21:21,756
You know what he says to me? He says
 that whenever he scores a century...

870
01:21:21,756 --> 01:21:27,637
"he raises a bat to me at the TV cameras,
 only then is it for the spectators"

871
01:21:28,346 --> 01:21:32,684
I saw how he reacted when
 you were reading his palm...

872
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:36,771
Don't tell anyone that I can
 read palms. That's a secret too

873
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:40,442
It's only because Sachin and I are
 such good friends. Or else...

874
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:43,528
"Read my palm, please!
 - No"

875
01:21:43,528 --> 01:21:49,576
"Else, I'll tell everyone that
 you're good at palmistry!"

876
01:21:51,369 --> 01:21:54,706
He's holding her hand!

877
01:21:54,831 --> 01:21:59,419
"Not here, else I'll be running
 a business in college from tomorrow"

878
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:07,677
May you have a thousand sons!
 Step on the brakes!

879
01:22:07,677 --> 01:22:11,723
You'll enjoy it!

880
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:20,357
This is a royal palm!

881
01:22:20,357 --> 01:22:24,944
Your mound of Venus is excellent

882
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:28,323
"In fact, every mounds of yours
 is so lovely"

883
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:31,451
Rascal!
 - Look at this

884
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:35,330
It says you're a typical...
 - Cancer?

885
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:40,794
"I knew it. Once you take a hand,
 you'll never let go"

886
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:47,592
"Alisha, people have noticed
 only your outward beauty"

887
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:53,682
No one has looked in your heart

888
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:58,770
"Despite having so many friends,
 you're so very lonely"

889
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:05,944
Oh yes! It says that although
 Mr. Perfect is right before you...

890
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:09,823
you're not being able to recognize him!
 - Really?

891
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:12,784
I have a similar line
 in my palm

892
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:18,039
"We aren't meant for
 each other, are we?"

893
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:21,042
And look at this!
 - What?

894
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:24,379
What's the name...? Rajiv!

895
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:29,759
A boy called Rajiv is going
 to buy you a coke

896
01:23:29,759 --> 01:23:34,347
See? Isn't my prediction immediate?

897
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:37,684
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.
 Right now...

898
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:42,063
it's a round of the painting
 competition at stall number 25

899
01:23:42,063 --> 01:23:47,402
We've got to win the prize
 for dancing and painting

900
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:51,364
"This doesn't look fake, does it?
 - You doubt Rocky's funda?"

901
01:23:51,364 --> 01:23:54,451
"Oh no, I simply asked.
 - If she's convinced..."

902
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:57,704
your job is done!

903
01:23:57,704 --> 01:23:59,748
"My God!
 What's happened to you, Rajiv?"

904
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:03,585
I'm depending on you
 for the dance and you...

905
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:08,340
"You're my main dancer, remember?
 - I know that, but what do I do?"

906
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,343
Listen...

907
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:22,687
What's happened to Rajiv's arm?
 - Forget it

908
01:24:22,687 --> 01:24:25,690
God has punished him
 for what he did

909
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:29,736
I must ask him

910
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:37,410
What happened?

911
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,746
It's nothing.
 I'll be okay in a week

912
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:41,998
Which means it isn't a fracture.
 - No

913
01:24:41,998 --> 01:24:45,877
"How did it happen?
 - Well... I fell down, you know"

914
01:24:45,877 --> 01:24:48,755
How?
 - I...

915
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:53,802
"You weren't climbing a pipe, were you?
 - Oh no!"

916
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:59,474
"Won't you say all the best"?"

917
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:04,020
How will you dance now?
 - I'll have to manage

918
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,651
It sure was a wrong number

919
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,529
The winner of the painting
 competition is...

920
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:16,574
Ms Payal from Spencer College!

921
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:24,749
"What happened to you, Rajiv?
 - I was going on my bike..."

922
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:28,628
"You broke your arm?
 - No, I love wearing a sling!"

923
01:25:28,628 --> 01:25:32,799
The dance competition
 is about to begin

924
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:38,346
Please don't tell Rajiv about it.
 - What?

925
01:25:38,346 --> 01:25:41,016
How he broke his arm.
 - How?

926
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:45,687
He was actually going on his bike
 to buy romantic cards for you...

927
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:50,734
For me? Why?
 - It's obvious

928
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:54,779
He's in love with you

929
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:06,332
Welcome to the last round of the
 inter-collegiate dance competition

930
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:11,546
We have so far seen
 other colleges perform

931
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:15,592
It's now the turn of Spencer College

932
01:26:17,427 --> 01:26:22,682
We're going to lose!
 Rajiv has broken his arm

933
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:29,564
What was the hurry?

934
01:26:29,564 --> 01:26:32,067
You could've bought the cards
 even later

935
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:34,361
"I'm not quitting college, am I?"

936
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:37,822
So you've got to know?
 - I know everything

937
01:26:37,822 --> 01:26:40,367
"How, Alisha?
 - Never mind that"

938
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:45,372
See what your stupidity has done.
 Everyone is so tensed

939
01:26:45,372 --> 01:26:49,751
"You mean, you are tensed too?"

940
01:26:52,045 --> 01:26:55,757
"I can bear to see anything,
 but I can't see you in this state"

941
01:26:55,757 --> 01:27:00,303
"What are you doing, Rajiv...?
 What?"

942
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:06,142
"I can do anything for you, Alisha"

943
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:21,700
We belong to each other!

944
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:34,004
"Why's every beautiful girl
 crazy after me?"

945
01:27:36,339 --> 01:27:41,302
"Why do they all say
 I love you to me?"

946
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:46,141
"Is my face really
 so romantic?"

947
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:50,145
"Yes, it is!"

948
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:53,565
"Are my eyes those
 of the dreamy lover?"

949
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:57,610
"Yes, they are!"

950
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:07,412
"I possess just one heart
 and there are a thousand girls"

951
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:12,667
"I wish I could split my heart into
 tiny pieces and give it to everyone"

952
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:21,343
Is it fun?

953
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:24,554
"You just saw the first sequence
 from Spencer College"

954
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:30,352
"Here comes Alisha Sahay
 with a surprise item!"

955
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:45,825
"If you're good looking,
 I'm young too"

956
01:28:45,825 --> 01:28:51,331
"Look at me from any angle you will.
 I'm no lesser than you are"

957
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:55,919
"Lightning strikes the hearts
 of those who behold us"

958
01:28:55,919 --> 01:28:59,798
"There's no one more beautiful
 than me"

959
01:28:59,798 --> 01:29:04,678
"So let go of my arm...
 let me go"

960
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:28,743
"With a smile,
 they rob us of our peace..."

961
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:31,287
these beautiful girls

962
01:29:31,287 --> 01:29:33,456
"They keep us awake
 night after night..."

963
01:29:33,456 --> 01:29:35,750
these beautiful girls

964
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,294
"They set our
 hearts hammering..."

965
01:29:38,294 --> 01:29:40,755
these beautiful girls

966
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:43,008
They make us pine...

967
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:45,468
these beautiful girls

968
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:49,639
"To their charm, to their eyes,
 to their age..."

969
01:29:50,015 --> 01:29:52,934
I'm sold

970
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:58,857
what am I to do?

971
01:30:27,635 --> 01:30:31,014
Of those spell-casting eyes...

972
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:35,310
I'm a lover of my beloved

973
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:40,648
"I can't tell you
 what fun this is"

974
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:45,820
"This is the intoxication
 of love"

975
01:30:46,946 --> 01:30:50,575
You have taken my heart away

976
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:53,995
You have driven me crazy

977
01:30:53,995 --> 01:30:57,082
My heart-beat sings for you...

978
01:30:57,082 --> 01:31:02,712
"and I've fallen in love,
 oh so gradually"

979
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:23,817
"Payal, what happened?
 - Nothing"

980
01:31:39,749 --> 01:31:45,380
You find your love...

981
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,716
with great difficulty

982
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:49,050
Love...

983
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:51,761
Love and romance

984
01:31:51,761 --> 01:31:57,726
Meet her gaze

985
01:31:59,227 --> 01:32:02,731
"Every one falls in love
 at least once in a lifetime"

986
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:07,819
Love and romance

987
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:38,725
The judges have decided the winners
 of today's dance competition...

988
01:32:44,647 --> 01:32:48,401
Let's congratulate Rajiv

989
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:53,948
"You've been so silly, Alisha"

990
01:32:53,948 --> 01:32:57,369
Your Mr. Right has been
 right before your eyes...

991
01:32:57,369 --> 01:33:00,914
and you didn't even recognize him?

992
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:05,502
"He's the one you've been
 looking for, Alisha"

993
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:11,383
Because he can do
 anything for you

994
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:29,693
What's this...?

995
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:35,365
Give me your blessings

996
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:43,915
Bless me too

997
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:58,430
"Something's burning, isn't it?"

998
01:34:04,477 --> 01:34:07,522
Sit down

999
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:15,739
When are you introducing me
 to Sachin?

1000
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:19,034
"Sachin...? Oh, Sachin!
 Any time you wish to"

1001
01:34:19,034 --> 01:34:23,121
"Let me get something to eat.
 Hungry, aren't you?"

1002
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:31,755
That's forty bucks...
 and another twenty

1003
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:35,133
Anything else?

1004
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:38,803
"Coming up, Princess!"

1005
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:48,396
"At this rate, I'll have to go
 around with a begging bowl"

1006
01:34:48,396 --> 01:34:53,193
"Parag, do you have a hundred bucks?
 - Yes"

1007
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:55,695
Give it to me.
 - What?

1008
01:34:55,695 --> 01:34:57,739
"The hundred bucks, I told you.
 - When did you?"

1009
01:34:57,739 --> 01:35:01,368
"You asked if I have it, I said yes.
 - Stop driving me up the wall!"

1010
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:03,787
I'll return it to you the moment
 I get my pocket money

1011
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:08,416
You will? Are you sure?
 - Of course

1012
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:16,508
That's 110?
 - Yes

1013
01:35:16,508 --> 01:35:19,094
"What's happening, dude?
 - I'm going mad!"

1014
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:22,430
She's more worried about Sachin!
 - I knew that was coming

1015
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:25,100
She's asking me to introduce her
 to Sachin. What am I to say?

1016
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:29,813
Don't say anything.
 - So who will? Sachin?

1017
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:39,656
What's for dinner tonight?

1018
01:35:39,656 --> 01:35:43,743
Sachin will call you in two minutes!
 - Sachin? What does that mean?

1019
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:48,081
Sachin's calling you
 in two minutes. That's it!

1020
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:52,460
Damn it! Oh yes!

1021
01:35:55,463 --> 01:36:00,468
What're you doing?
 - That's my hundred bucks too

1022
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,390
Here's your spread.
 - I'm famished

1023
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:10,020
Who's that...? Sachin!

1024
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:12,105
Go on. Where are you calling from?

1025
01:36:12,105 --> 01:36:14,691
"Well? Scoring with her, are you?"

1026
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:18,611
Oh yes. So how have you been?
 - A scoundrel. Like you

1027
01:36:18,611 --> 01:36:21,990
Oh yes

1028
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:28,371
The name? Alisha

1029
01:36:30,707 --> 01:36:32,917
You want to talk to her?

1030
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:37,422
Guess what? You're one of the few
 sports persons she likes very much

1031
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:42,052
Don't talk too much.
 It goes to his head

1032
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:53,855
Rajiv is always talking about you

1033
01:36:53,855 --> 01:36:56,149
"When are we meeting, Sachin?"

1034
01:36:56,149 --> 01:37:00,028
Whenever I'm in Mumbai for a couple
 of days at a stretch

1035
01:37:00,028 --> 01:37:04,115
"Before that, we'll have
 to ask Rajiv"

1036
01:37:04,115 --> 01:37:06,368
"So decide quickly, okay?"

1037
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:10,789
Sure. Please give
 the telephone to Rajiv

1038
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,376
"Yes, Sachin...?
 Everything is all right"

1039
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:18,046
"Just take care of those pitched
 outside the off stump, okay?"

1040
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:22,133
Pay my regards to your wife

1041
01:37:23,385 --> 01:37:26,471
Let's go. I want to go home.
 - How about the food?

1042
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:28,515
My stomach is full!
 I've spoken to Sachin!

1043
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:31,059
"Let's go.
 - Okay, let's go"

1044
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:35,939
"No, Mama. I won't eat outside"

1045
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:41,736
Here's your hundred bucks.
 Eat it up

1046
01:37:42,112 --> 01:37:44,030
This is the first time
 I'm dropping Alisha home

1047
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:46,700
Must I kiss her or mustn't I?

1048
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,369
Must I ask her?

1049
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:54,749
"Actually, I'll hold
 her hand first..."

1050
01:38:13,518 --> 01:38:17,897
My heart took the blow...

1051
01:38:17,897 --> 01:38:22,068
"and I started
 falling in love"

1052
01:38:22,068 --> 01:38:28,616
"My heart took a liking
 to the stranger"

1053
01:38:32,746 --> 01:38:37,125
We crazed lovers...

1054
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:41,338
now pray...

1055
01:38:41,338 --> 01:38:45,550
all our lives...

1056
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:50,388
"may the story of our love
 continue"

1057
01:39:15,455 --> 01:39:19,709
"In my dreams,
 he quietly appears"

1058
01:39:19,709 --> 01:39:24,047
He robs me of my peace

1059
01:39:24,047 --> 01:39:28,385
In your arms...

1060
01:39:28,385 --> 01:39:32,639
let me remain

1061
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,352
Let me kiss your lips

1062
01:39:37,352 --> 01:39:41,690
This weather of pining...

1063
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:45,443
clouds everything else

1064
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:52,659
"May our love story
 continue through our lives"

1065
01:40:13,388 --> 01:40:17,934
"Payal, I'm going
 to the library"

1066
01:40:18,852 --> 01:40:21,479
Mambo's not around.
 Where has he gone?

1067
01:40:21,479 --> 01:40:26,401
He should be coming any moment.
 You can wait here for him

1068
01:40:28,111 --> 01:40:33,074
Writing the notes for me?
 - No. For Mambo

1069
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:40,331
"Payal, you know about Alisha
 and me, don't you...?"

1070
01:40:45,378 --> 01:40:49,174
"Besides, we're always going
 to be friends. Right?"

1071
01:40:49,174 --> 01:40:52,552
"Hi, Mambo. What's cooking?
 - Let's talk later, okay?"

1072
01:40:52,552 --> 01:40:55,180
Aren't you ready yet?
 Hurry up!

1073
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:58,600
The ad says we mustn't miss
 the beginning of the film

1074
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:03,396
Are you coming...?
 See you later

1075
01:41:12,113 --> 01:41:14,032
Don't they look cute together?
 - Who?

1076
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:15,950
"Mambo and Payal, of course"

1077
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:18,036
I think something's brewing
 between the two of them

1078
01:41:18,036 --> 01:41:20,914
"What nonsense!
 They're old friends, that's all"

1079
01:41:20,914 --> 01:41:23,541
"I know that, but they've gone
 to see a film together"

1080
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:26,336
"So? They invited me too.
 - Just a formality, buddy"

1081
01:41:26,336 --> 01:41:31,341
"C'mon, Javed. I know Payal. She
 won't encourage someone like Mambo"

1082
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:35,011
"In any case, why must I be worried
 if something's on between them?"

1083
01:41:35,011 --> 01:41:39,057
Don't get angry

1084
01:41:46,815 --> 01:41:50,735
She's so sweet!

1085
01:41:54,406 --> 01:41:58,702
My sister Priya.
 Alisha... Kamlabai

1086
01:42:03,623 --> 01:42:06,710
Who's that?

1087
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:09,754
Must be Rajiv's classmate.
 Why?

1088
01:42:09,754 --> 01:42:12,007
She appears to come
 from a rich family

1089
01:42:12,007 --> 01:42:15,343
"The richer they are,
 the lesser clothes they wear"

1090
01:42:15,343 --> 01:42:18,346
Close your mouth.
 You're drooling

1091
01:42:18,346 --> 01:42:22,434
Let's go and see

1092
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:29,024
Please be seated

1093
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:32,360
She has just arrived from Ooty
 and recently joined the college

1094
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,529
She has won quite a few
 beauty contests too

1095
01:42:34,529 --> 01:42:36,698
She does appear to be a model

1096
01:42:36,698 --> 01:42:40,744
What appear...?
 She is indeed a model

1097
01:42:41,494 --> 01:42:45,749
She's getting so many offers.
 Only yesterday...

1098
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:50,045
"Aunty, Rajiv has this habit of hiding
 his own qualities from people"

1099
01:42:50,045 --> 01:42:52,380
What qualities does he possess?

1100
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:58,386
Take Sachin for instance. He...
 - There's someone at the door!

1101
01:42:58,386 --> 01:43:03,099
Who's Sachin?
 - Must be the thin boy in the building

1102
01:43:03,099 --> 01:43:06,603
"I've been waiting for you
 for such a long time, Payal!"

1103
01:43:06,603 --> 01:43:11,941
"Payal! After all these days!
 - Are you angry with us, dear?"

1104
01:43:18,531 --> 01:43:21,618
"Will you have something, Alisha?
 - No thanks, aunty"

1105
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:27,665
"Rajiv, will you come here please?
 - Coming"

1106
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:31,670
What does your mother do? Is she
 a housewife or is she working?

1107
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:33,505
Or is she a model too?

1108
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:37,342
Where is the book I asked
 you to give Payal?

1109
01:43:37,342 --> 01:43:41,346
Must be around...

1110
01:43:55,527 --> 01:43:59,030
"I must leave now, Priya.
 - You've just come!"

1111
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:01,783
You aren't going anywhere.
 - I'll come again

1112
01:44:01,783 --> 01:44:05,120
"Shall we leave, Rajiv?
 - Yes. Let me drop you home"

1113
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:09,332
"Drop Payal home too.
 - No, I'll go on my own"

1114
01:44:09,332 --> 01:44:13,003
"Take the car, Rajiv"

1115
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:25,765
Your hair has grown too much

1116
01:44:25,765 --> 01:44:29,728
What happened?
 - Nothing

1117
01:44:29,769 --> 01:44:33,481
And I thought Payal
 is an old friend of yours

1118
01:44:33,481 --> 01:44:38,153
"How long have you known Rajiv, Payal?
 - Since our childhood"

1119
01:44:39,654 --> 01:44:44,117
I'll sit with you some day and
 get to know all his secrets

1120
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:56,588
"Sorry, we've driven past your place.
 - It's okay. I'm quite used to it"

1121
01:45:06,056 --> 01:45:10,101
"But she's a bit reserved,
 isn't she?"

1122
01:45:23,823 --> 01:45:26,451
Pray that I receive a call
 from the ad agency

1123
01:45:26,451 --> 01:45:32,082
"If I sign the contract, I'll
 definitely be one of the top models"

1124
01:45:32,374 --> 01:45:35,960
What happened?
 - What's your problem?

1125
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,713
"Forget it, Rajiv...
 they're kids"

1126
01:45:38,713 --> 01:45:41,132
Kids?

1127
01:45:41,132 --> 01:45:43,510
You...

1128
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:47,389
"Don't give them so much
 of importance, Rajiv"

1129
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:51,434
It happens all the time

1130
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:55,480
Why do you need
 to wear such clothes?

1131
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:59,067
"Rajiv, this is how
 I've always been"

1132
01:45:59,067 --> 01:46:04,406
And not even my Papa has ever
 said anything to me

1133
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:10,662
"I can very well handle
 such situations, Rajiv"

1134
01:46:21,631 --> 01:46:23,675
Here start the calls

1135
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:27,053
"Hurry up, I want to make a call.
 - Okay"

1136
01:46:27,053 --> 01:46:31,141
"Must be a girl, isn't it?
 My son, after all"

1137
01:46:31,141 --> 01:46:36,813
"He has taken after me in looks!
 - Spare him, please. If not me"

1138
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:43,028
I know whose call it is

1139
01:46:47,365 --> 01:46:51,995
So you've even forgotten
 my voice now?

1140
01:46:57,417 --> 01:46:59,419
May you find success in
 everything you do...

1141
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:02,047
and you will never
 forget your old friends

1142
01:47:02,047 --> 01:47:06,718
"What special plans for the day?
 - Nothing as yet, but..."

1143
01:47:07,635 --> 01:47:10,347
Which means my treat
 remains doubtful

1144
01:47:10,347 --> 01:47:14,100
"No, it's not that"

1145
01:47:15,352 --> 01:47:19,397
You needn't think so much

1146
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:37,665
"Mine is the first call, isn't it?
 - Oh yes, yours is the first"

1147
01:47:37,665 --> 01:47:42,337
I knew it! And guess what?
 You're very lucky for me!

1148
01:47:42,337 --> 01:47:45,799
Because I've received a call for
 my first shoot on your birthday

1149
01:47:45,799 --> 01:47:48,760
Wow! When is it?
 - Today!

1150
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:51,846
Today...?
 - That's where I'm calling from

1151
01:47:51,846 --> 01:47:55,517
"After pack up, I'll meet you
 at the Velocity"

1152
01:47:55,517 --> 01:47:57,977
I'll ask Tony to invite
 everyone there

1153
01:47:57,977 --> 01:48:02,691
"Alisha, the shot is ready.
 - Gotta go, Rajiv!"

1154
01:48:26,297 --> 01:48:30,593
"Relax, Rajiv.
 She's surely coming"

1155
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:44,065
Drink it up!

1156
01:48:45,734 --> 01:48:48,403
Have some water

1157
01:48:48,403 --> 01:48:51,489
"Danny, why don't you listen?"

1158
01:48:51,489 --> 01:48:53,783
Are you okay?

1159
01:48:53,783 --> 01:48:56,369
Are you enjoying yourself?

1160
01:48:56,369 --> 01:48:58,705
Are you enjoying yourself?
 - Yes

1161
01:48:58,705 --> 01:49:01,791
Yours was the first call
 this morning

1162
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:04,085
That's what I've been
 doing all these years

1163
01:49:04,085 --> 01:49:09,883
"I don't know whether I have the right,
 Rajiv. But here you are anyway"

1164
01:49:15,347 --> 01:49:19,976
So you remembered?
 - Not a word from you

1165
01:49:35,408 --> 01:49:39,496
"I thought you didn't like going to
 the discotheques, Payal"

1166
01:49:39,496 --> 01:49:42,082
That's the problem.
 No one ever asked me

1167
01:49:42,082 --> 01:49:46,044
"Mambo asked me today
 and I said, why not"

1168
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:50,048
What happened?

1169
01:49:50,048 --> 01:49:53,051
What for?

1170
01:49:55,345 --> 01:49:59,849
"You know, Rajiv. I've begun to realize
 that I haven't understood myself either"

1171
01:50:01,351 --> 01:50:05,772
"At times, I think
 you were always right"

1172
01:50:05,772 --> 01:50:10,568
Love and romance...
 mean nothing

1173
01:50:10,568 --> 01:50:15,657
The things I thought right don't
 fit into the scheme of things today

1174
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:21,746
The ideals I clung to make me look
 like a fool today

1175
01:50:22,414 --> 01:50:26,334
That's not...
 - That is true!

1176
01:50:26,334 --> 01:50:29,879
You look so happy with Alisha

1177
01:50:29,879 --> 01:50:33,633
You never looked so happy with me

1178
01:50:33,633 --> 01:50:37,762
Because I never possessed
 what Alisha has

1179
01:50:38,346 --> 01:50:42,017
"Things you wanted.
 - You possess it all, Payal"

1180
01:50:42,017 --> 01:50:44,436
"You're understanding,
 very caring..."

1181
01:50:44,436 --> 01:50:47,147
"you're so sweet, you have
 such a large heart and..."

1182
01:50:47,147 --> 01:50:51,401
"What good is all that?
 I'm not Alisha, after all"

1183
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:53,486
"Payal, you...
 - Know something, Rajiv"

1184
01:50:53,486 --> 01:50:58,783
"I've always believed in letting
 my love go free, if it wishes to"

1185
01:51:00,201 --> 01:51:04,622
"If it returns to me,
 it is indeed mine"

1186
01:51:04,622 --> 01:51:07,709
If it doesn't...

1187
01:51:07,709 --> 01:51:11,755
"you didn't return to me, Rajiv"

1188
01:51:12,464 --> 01:51:15,425
"Don't say that, Payal.
 It was my mistake"

1189
01:51:15,425 --> 01:51:19,804
"I was the one who did wrong,
 you were always right"

1190
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:25,477
Please don't blame yourself.
 Please

1191
01:51:42,786 --> 01:51:46,539
"Honey, you're forgetting something"

1192
01:51:47,624 --> 01:51:49,709
You didn't ask me
 how my shoot went

1193
01:51:49,709 --> 01:51:54,089
How did it go?
 - Great! Superb!

1194
01:51:54,089 --> 01:51:57,050
I got...

1195
01:51:58,927 --> 01:52:01,429
"what happened, Rajiv?
 - Nothing"

1196
01:52:01,429 --> 01:52:07,394
"The director made me so comfortable,
 I didn't realize it was my first shoot"

1197
01:52:42,762 --> 01:52:46,683
Mambo...
 - Yes?

1198
01:52:46,683 --> 01:52:51,104
"What are you up to, Mambo?
 - What?"

1199
01:52:51,104 --> 01:52:54,441
Payal's a nice girl. So don't...

1200
01:52:54,441 --> 01:52:59,362
You're telling me all this? You?
 How about what you did to her?

1201
01:52:59,362 --> 01:53:02,115
So don't lecture me.
 What does she mean to you...

1202
01:53:02,115 --> 01:53:05,326
There was another reason for whatever
 happened between Payal and me

1203
01:53:05,326 --> 01:53:09,497
"But I just can't trust you, okay?
 - I see! You can't trust me!"

1204
01:53:09,497 --> 01:53:14,002
What happened to the trust
 Payal placed in you?

1205
01:53:14,419 --> 01:53:17,422
Forget it. Don't worry about her

1206
01:53:17,422 --> 01:53:22,344
She can't go around with a guy who
 won't even spare the maidservants!

1207
01:53:22,344 --> 01:53:25,347
If you do anything with Payal...
 - What are you going to do?

1208
01:53:25,347 --> 01:53:29,684
What are you going to do?
 - I'll forget you're my friend

1209
01:53:30,685 --> 01:53:34,773
"Rajiv, what's happening here?"

1210
01:53:36,024 --> 01:53:39,527
Let's go!

1211
01:53:39,527 --> 01:53:42,697
"What is the matter, Rajiv? Where to?
 - Home"

1212
01:53:42,697 --> 01:53:46,701
"What is the matter?
 - Nothing, let's go"

1213
01:53:48,078 --> 01:53:52,123
"It's your birthday, Rajiv!
 Now tell me what happened"

1214
01:53:52,123 --> 01:53:55,460
Nothing has happened.
 I just have a headache

1215
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:59,381
I don't think it's a headache.
 It's something else

1216
01:53:59,381 --> 01:54:05,345
"Since I've arrived, I've found you
 paying more attention to Payal and Mambo"

1217
01:54:05,387 --> 01:54:08,598
"The two of you weren't fighting
 over Payal, were you...?"

1218
01:54:08,598 --> 01:54:13,353
"It's nothing, let's go. Please"

1219
01:55:11,828 --> 01:55:14,372
"How did your
 economics paper go, Mambo?"

1220
01:55:14,372 --> 01:55:18,835
The questions were pretty easy.
 Answering them was tough

1221
01:55:28,345 --> 01:55:31,806
Careful...

1222
01:55:45,362 --> 01:55:49,115
What are you doing?

1223
01:55:53,411 --> 01:55:57,415
"Candy, what's the story
 behind Payal and Rajiv?"

1224
01:55:57,415 --> 01:56:01,336
Story? Nothing at all

1225
01:56:01,336 --> 01:56:06,424
What does that mean?
 - It means they were in love

1226
01:56:06,424 --> 01:56:10,845
They were friends from childhood
 and it turned into love

1227
01:56:11,096 --> 01:56:15,725
"They unfortunately broke up and that
 is when you joined college, isn't it?"

1228
01:56:15,725 --> 01:56:21,731
I wonder how you don't know.
 Everybody knows about it

1229
01:56:30,657 --> 01:56:32,450
One moment...
 - What happened?

1230
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:38,081
What do you think? I'm blind
 and cannot see?

1231
01:56:40,417 --> 01:56:44,713
"He belongs to me. Whatever you do,
 you can't have him from me again"

1232
01:56:45,547 --> 01:56:49,718
If you want to make your
 ex-boyfriend feel jealous...

1233
01:56:49,718 --> 01:56:52,762
pretend to be in love
 with his best friend

1234
01:56:52,762 --> 01:56:57,350
If you think you can snatch Rajiv
 from me so easily...

1235
01:57:00,103 --> 01:57:04,774
Because he loves only me.
 Only me

1236
01:57:04,774 --> 01:57:08,403
What are you doing?
 - I'm not talking to you Mambo

1237
01:57:08,403 --> 01:57:12,574
"Mind your own business, loser.
 - This is my business"

1238
01:57:12,574 --> 01:57:16,911
What are you going to do about it?
 Don't you dare raise your hand

1239
01:57:35,764 --> 01:57:38,641
He raises his hand at girls!

1240
01:57:38,641 --> 01:57:40,935
How dare you touch her.
 - Before talking to me...

1241
01:57:40,935 --> 01:57:43,897
ask her what she said to Payal!
 - Why are you dragging Payal into this?

1242
01:57:43,897 --> 01:57:46,358
"Tell him, Alisha!
 What did you say to Payal?"

1243
01:57:46,358 --> 01:57:50,028
It's all Payal's mistake!
 - Payal's?

1244
01:57:50,028 --> 01:57:52,697
"Yes, your ex-girlfriend
 Payal's mistake"

1245
01:57:52,697 --> 01:57:54,949
She thinks she's very smart

1246
01:57:54,949 --> 01:57:57,786
I'm fortunate to have got to know
 everything at the right time

1247
01:57:57,786 --> 01:58:00,955
"Else, there's no saying
 what she could have done"

1248
01:58:00,955 --> 01:58:04,959
"Get lost, you bastard!
 Go away!"

1249
01:58:04,959 --> 01:58:08,963
You hit me for her sake?

1250
01:58:09,047 --> 01:58:14,386
Give him a big hand for this!
 Go on!

1251
01:58:15,345 --> 01:58:19,391
We're not worthy of you anymore

1252
01:58:21,643 --> 01:58:24,312
"Payal and Mambo are
 not to blame, Rajiv"

1253
01:58:24,312 --> 01:58:29,025
"What madness is this, Rajiv?
 Payal has done nothing"

1254
01:58:37,325 --> 01:58:39,494
"Payal and Mambo are
 not to blame, Rajiv"

1255
01:58:39,494 --> 01:58:41,830
Give him a big hand for this!

1256
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:46,501
"What madness is this, Rajiv?
 Payal has done nothing"

1257
01:59:05,562 --> 01:59:09,357
You must be thinking that I'm
 being extremely possessive

1258
01:59:09,357 --> 01:59:12,360
But what could I have done?

1259
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:16,531
I could see everything
 so clearly

1260
01:59:17,657 --> 01:59:23,705
"I love you, Rajiv. And I don't know
 how long I've loved you"

1261
01:59:24,789 --> 01:59:29,294
"This isn't just a ritual,
 it's my love for you"

1262
01:59:29,294 --> 01:59:32,464
"Know what, Rajiv?
 I can blindly trust you"

1263
01:59:32,464 --> 01:59:36,426
I've always felt that you must
 let your love go free

1264
01:59:36,426 --> 01:59:41,348
"If it returns to you,
 it is indeed yours"

1265
01:59:45,727 --> 01:59:50,774
"Rajiv, you love me too.
 Don't you?"

1266
01:59:53,485 --> 01:59:56,363
I don't want to be
 separated from you

1267
01:59:56,363 --> 02:00:00,367
"I can do anything for you.
 You do love me, don't you?"

1268
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:04,412
You do love me?

1269
02:00:27,352 --> 02:00:32,399
If you guys lace the juice
 with liquor...

1270
02:00:33,775 --> 02:00:36,444
How am I looking today?
 - Want me to flatter you?

1271
02:00:36,444 --> 02:00:40,699
Or must I speak the truth?
 - Skip the nonsense

1272
02:00:40,699 --> 02:00:44,411
I'm going to propose to her today.
 - Don't tell me!

1273
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:47,455
She needs me.
 And I need her too

1274
02:00:47,455 --> 02:00:50,750
I hope she agrees

1275
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:54,754
Don't worry.
 She'll definitely agree

1276
02:01:10,353 --> 02:01:13,690
You've been my best friend
 and I...

1277
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:17,694
I ask for your forgiveness
 in everybody's presence

1278
02:01:17,694 --> 02:01:21,656
Have we never fought before?
 Let it go...

1279
02:01:21,656 --> 02:01:25,660
"let it go, please"

1280
02:01:26,995 --> 02:01:32,417
"Won't it stink if I let go, Rajiv?"

1281
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:41,509
"I don't know what ego-trip
 I was on, Mambo"

1282
02:01:41,509 --> 02:01:46,056
I've hurt everyone...
 especially Payal

1283
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:50,226
But you really recognized
 Payal's true worth

1284
02:01:54,439 --> 02:01:56,816
All I will ask you to do
 is to take care of her

1285
02:01:56,816 --> 02:02:00,695
But give me one opportunity...
 I want to apologize to her

1286
02:02:00,695 --> 02:02:05,033
"I see. You want to say sorry to her?
 Go ahead, son. I give you permission"

1287
02:02:08,370 --> 02:02:11,831
"Moron! You always call me
 names, don't you?"

1288
02:02:11,831 --> 02:02:14,376
But do you really think
 I'm such a scoundrel?

1289
02:02:14,376 --> 02:02:16,086
What do you mean?

1290
02:02:16,086 --> 02:02:21,675
"Rajiv, he's crazy about Polly Pereira
 and he's even going to propose to her"

1291
02:02:22,384 --> 02:02:24,511
So you're going to propose to Polly?
 - Right

1292
02:02:24,511 --> 02:02:26,680
I'm going to do something right
 for the first time in my life

1293
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:31,559
What might she do? Turn me down?
 Slap me...? What else?

1294
02:02:31,559 --> 02:02:35,855
And I'm going to do something right
 for the first time in my life too

1295
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:48,410
Or your girlfriend will think
 I'm snatching you from her

1296
02:02:50,370 --> 02:02:54,082
"Else, I'll go away"

1297
02:03:01,381 --> 02:03:04,342
It's very important for me
 to say this

1298
02:03:04,342 --> 02:03:09,347
"Friends, six months ago..."

1299
02:03:09,347 --> 02:03:15,729
"in your presence, I had challenged
 Mambo, Payal and the gang..."

1300
02:03:17,063 --> 02:03:21,317
that the most beautiful girl in the
 college would be my girlfriend

1301
02:03:22,861 --> 02:03:27,615
Maybe I was trying to prove that
 I was stud of this college

1302
02:03:27,615 --> 02:03:32,370
Like Javed and Danny. I didn't
 know what love was all about

1303
02:03:32,370 --> 02:03:35,331
I didn't accept it
 and I was wrong

1304
02:03:35,331 --> 02:03:39,669
"I took Alisha as my girlfriend,
 but I never loved her"

1305
02:03:41,796 --> 02:03:46,384
Because I didn't know
 what love meant

1306
02:03:47,135 --> 02:03:50,055
And there was this girl who loved me
 right from our childhood...

1307
02:03:50,055 --> 02:03:54,809
she always trusted me...
 and I spurned her

1308
02:03:54,809 --> 02:03:59,397
And now that I know
 what love is...

1309
02:04:00,315 --> 02:04:04,027
I realize what I have lost

1310
02:04:04,027 --> 02:04:08,073
I have lost Payal forever

1311
02:04:08,323 --> 02:04:13,745
And this is my punishment.
 I deserve it

1312
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:20,085
"Maybe these words are going to sound
 very hollow, coming from me"

1313
02:04:25,006 --> 02:04:29,094
I seek your forgiveness
 in everybody's presence today

1314
02:04:32,347 --> 02:04:37,060
"Please forgive me, if you can"

1315
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:43,108
This is what you always do.
 You first break my heart...

1316
02:04:43,108 --> 02:04:47,570
and do something stupid like this
 and expect me to forgive you

1317
02:04:49,406 --> 02:04:54,202
"No, I'm not forgiving you this time"

1318
02:04:54,494 --> 02:04:57,539
I don't want to listen
 to another word

1319
02:04:57,539 --> 02:05:02,043
Your stupid lecture isn't
 going to make heart melt

1320
02:05:02,043 --> 02:05:05,046
"Don't look at me,
 look down!"

1321
02:05:05,046 --> 02:05:09,050
The problem is...
 I'm too good for you

1322
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:12,929
You don't deserve me

1323
02:05:15,807 --> 02:05:21,438
Why the silly smile?
 I'm not kidding

1324
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:27,694
I have truly loved you

1325
02:05:51,801 --> 02:05:55,764
"You have stolen Rajiv from me.
 Haven't you, Payal?"

1326
02:05:55,764 --> 02:05:59,768
"I've been a proper fool.
 Haven't I, Rajiv?"

1327
02:05:59,768 --> 02:06:03,980
"No, Alisha.
 That's not how it is"

1328
02:06:08,818 --> 02:06:13,907
"Your palm says that although your
 Miss Perfect is right before you..."

1329
02:06:14,449 --> 02:06:18,661
"you will not be able
 to recognize her"

1330
02:06:34,344 --> 02:06:39,057
"I swear, I haven't done anything"

1331
02:06:40,975 --> 02:06:45,355
That year I thought I had
 lost Payal forever

1332
02:06:45,355 --> 02:06:49,359
"But I guess, love finds
 its own way around"

1333
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:52,612
And where are you folks going?
 The story isn't over yet

1334
02:06:52,612 --> 02:06:57,409
Don't you want to know whether
 Mambo finally pitched his tent?

1335
02:06:57,409 --> 02:07:01,871
"You do, don't you?
 So take a look"

1336
02:07:11,506 --> 02:07:15,593
"My friend says,
 I love you"

1337
02:07:16,011 --> 02:07:20,807
You take a year
 to tell me this much?

1338
02:07:31,776 --> 02:07:36,364
That's my dad's number.
 The police commissioner of Mumbai
