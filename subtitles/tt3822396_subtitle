1
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:59,357
Watch Ankur (1974) Movie

2
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,825
You won't make it.
You will never make it.

3
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,961
Sleeping till eight or nine!
How will you get anywhere in life? Wake up!

4
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:05,686
One who works will set alarm to wake up.

5
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:07,957
Unemployed man like me
gets up only if father scold.

6
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:11,124
l'm one of the lakhs of engineers
who passed out wanting to make it big.

7
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:12,166
On Day 1 , can't forget the happy moments
standing outside my college

8
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,168
''Yes, l'm going to become an engineer!''

9
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,704
l smoked, l drank, l bunked college
and l went to the movies.

10
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:17,341
l had many arrears but
l cleared them in my final year.

11
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:19,942
l thought l was the engineer,
but there were 10 lakh others like me.

12
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:22,511
About ten thousand of them
are geniuses, jobs find them.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,238
Twenty thousand of them
might have influential fathers.

14
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:25,882
Thirty thousand might have
family owned business.

15
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,415
l belong to the remaining majority.

16
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:29,519
Which is...waste fellow!

17
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:36,956
Your brother's bike won't start.
Go drop him at work and come.

18
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:39,186
He's three years younger to me.

19
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:41,855
But l'm woken up to drop him at work.

20
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:44,024
lt's just your little brother.
Drop him off.

21
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:46,693
Why can't he drop him this one day?

22
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:49,463
He's been sitting idly for four years
after finishing his engineering, right?

23
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:50,437
And so much ego!

24
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:51,700
Moreover made big statements.

25
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:54,367
''All the buildings in Vizag
will be built by me.''

26
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:55,739
He has to build castles in the air.

27
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,712
lf you tell anyone from morning
''You'll never make it''.

28
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:00,214
How can one make it?

29
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,942
How will you get a job
if you go looking like this?

30
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:06,318
lf you shave and look neat,
you'll get hired.

31
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,982
My mother believes that
shaving will get me a job.

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,252
Brother, l'm getting late for work.

33
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:11,053
Please, brother. Let's go.

34
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,424
This fool is my brother.
He's taller and better looking than me.

35
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,156
Most importantly, he has a job.

36
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,061
This is my vehicle.

37
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:18,532
My dad bought for me in 7th class
for getting first rank.

38
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,534
Never gave him another
opportunity again.

39
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:25,639
Hey! Come here.

40
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,773
l dropped you, right?
Give me fifty bucks.

41
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,579
Twenty only? Okay, go.

42
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:40,254
l'm an unemployed graduate.

43
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,516
My name is Raghuvaran.

44
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:12,956
lf a guy is jobless, they make him
to do all the household work.

45
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,124
This is my dog.
His name is Harry Potter.

46
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:18,126
Don't ask me why l named him so
l don't remember.

47
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:22,866
l understood TV serials are interesting
by staying in home with my mother.

48
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:27,070
l'm tired of filling applications.

49
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,968
After finishing engineering,
you either need to work as an engineer.

50
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,734
Or take whatever job comes your way.

51
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:33,809
Or else...

52
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,837
What l think even when l sleep is,

53
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:38,346
people who watched film 'Shiva',
most of them liked Nagarjuna,

54
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:41,007
but my father liked Raghuvaran,
okay he liked him,

55
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,449
without stopping with that,
why did he name after him?

56
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:45,088
By the way we're Telugu people.

57
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:02,467
Where are you taking it?

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,006
To the hall, madam?
- No, take it to my room upstairs.

59
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:06,837
The room to your right upstairs.

60
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,809
Where madam?
- Right side!

61
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:11,380
How can l tell you more clearly?

62
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,380
How can l find the room carrying
so much weight, madam?

63
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:15,451
Fine, l'll take you there. Come.

64
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:21,848
lf fate had been on my side the guy who
brought table would've come a little later.

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,549
My bad time.

66
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:30,061
Who's moved in next door?

67
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:31,929
A doctor called Gokul.

68
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:35,104
They have a daughter.
She looked like a movie star!

69
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:37,399
She came home this afternoon
to borrow something.

70
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:40,778
Really? l was home all day,
l never saw her.

71
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:44,040
You're home all day.
That's my problem.

72
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,279
A waste fellow should always
be arrogant.

73
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,515
lf we bend over a little bit,
they'll screw us over.

74
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:56,216
l've kept milk on table for you,
take it, Karthik.

75
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,588
Okay, mother.

76
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:14,076
This happens in my house
very often.

77
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:17,612
l struggle hard to hide
this cigarette every day.

78
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:25,845
Brother, give me the laptop.
l have office work!

79
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,685
Give me the laptop.
- Hey, wait.

80
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:30,917
Always on Facebook!

81
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,790
You've got a group for
the unemployed people.

82
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:36,297
You call yourselves V.l.P!
There are 60000 members too!

83
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:39,292
You're mocking me because
l'm borrowing your laptop?

84
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,097
Take your lousy laptop!

85
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:44,973
lt's hard to not look at
an ordinary girl next door.

86
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:49,203
lf she looks like a movie star.
Can't stop till we see her!

87
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:58,553
lf you don't have a job,
even your pet dog won't respect you.

88
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:18,300
Who is it?
- Aunty, l live next door.

89
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:20,171
The ball fell in. So

90
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:21,902
Come in. Take it.

91
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:30,820
What's your name?
- Raghuvaran.

92
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,550
Where do you work?

93
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:40,491
''Bommalatta'' serial has started!
l'll come get it later.

94
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:42,326
Hey, you watch it too?

95
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,661
lf l get angry, l'll get my son
married for the second time.

96
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:47,895
No, mother-in-law!

97
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,200
This mother-in-law is so mean!

98
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,433
Even l don't like this
character at all, aunty.

99
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,807
lf someone troubles my daughter like this,
l'll just ask her to come back.

100
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,780
Aunty, you have a daughter?
- Yes, name is Shalini.

101
00:07:00,484 --> 00:07:05,251
Has she gone to school?
- School? No way, she's 23 years.

102
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:09,823
ls she asleep?
- No, she's gone to work.

103
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,022
Her father is already getting egoistic.

104
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:16,723
That his daughter is making
more money than him.

105
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:20,570
She must be making around
50000 a month?

106
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:24,435
50000?
Her father makes almost a lakh a month.

107
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,770
Her salary is Rs.2 lakhs a month!

108
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:28,468
Even jobless girls don't look at me.

109
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:33,106
Rs.2 lakhs a month!
No use of throwing ball into this house.

110
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:40,121
What are you doing here?
- No dad, the ball fell in.

111
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:43,794
l saw you coming out of this house
10 years ago.

112
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:46,088
Even then you told me
the same reason.

113
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:49,722
You were playing with ten other boys then.
Now you're playing alone.

114
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,800
Because they've all got jobs now.

115
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:54,836
Three families have lived here.
And it's been painted five times.

116
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,338
But you're still the same.

117
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:00,842
See if there's any work at home.

118
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:06,245
How that girl gauges me is up to her.

119
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,317
But l need to try from my side, right?

120
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:11,421
l need to see that girl who looks
like a movie star.

121
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,787
l thought he'd study and build houses.
But he's playing with plastic dolls.

122
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,986
You just need an excuse to deride him.

123
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,097
Basically l'm a decent guy.

124
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,472
But at times l've to be indecent.
Can't avoid it.

125
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:37,273
ls my phone downstairs, mother?
- Yes.

126
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:41,718
Wanted to feed that dog,
where's it gone?

127
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,449
What are you doing here?
All are downstairs.

128
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:46,613
Nothing, just like that.

129
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,884
What's that in your hand?
- Nothing, mom.

130
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,024
Give it to me.

131
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:52,193
What is this?

132
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:56,058
l told you, right?
A new project for engineering students.

133
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,395
What does it do?

134
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:03,036
lt's like a telescope.
Things that are far away look closer.

135
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:09,773
Not me, mom!

136
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:12,415
Look up! You'll be able
to see the stars and moon.

137
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,220
Yes, it looks so close!

138
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:22,919
You can't touch it, mom.

139
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,097
Raghu, you made this yourself?

140
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:32,832
You're a talented guy.
But why aren't you getting a job?

141
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:34,664
Talent is not enough these days.

142
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,831
What else they want?
Talent is more than enough.

143
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,168
Come on, mother.

144
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,903
Have you watched the film Titanic?

145
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,845
Yeah, the one where the ship sinks and
everyone dies drowning in sea.

146
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,176
That's right.

147
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:51,344
The hero shows stars and
moon to the heroine.

148
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:54,184
l'm doomed to watch it with you!

149
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,450
You devil! When did you fall in love?

150
00:09:57,595 --> 00:10:00,928
Who would love me, mom?
- What's wrong with you?

151
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:02,895
Aren't you handsome and intelligent?

152
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,364
l'm unemployed, mom!

153
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,960
Girls don't love boys without
minimum security.

154
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:13,102
l have a friend's birthday party tomorrow.
Everyone has to bring Rs.2000.

155
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,711
Please arrange it somehow.

156
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,642
Okay, l'll get it from your
younger brother.

157
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:18,413
lt's better you hit me with slippers!

158
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,709
Either get it from dad,
or l don't want!

159
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:24,048
l'll not take a penny from him.
- Okay, we'll see.

160
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:26,985
Raghu, here's Rs.200.

161
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,887
Mom, l asked for 2000 and
you're giving me 200.

162
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,253
l could get this much only.
Make do with this.

163
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,894
Couldn't flick any more from your dad.

164
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:33,654
Come here.
- l'm coming, dear.

165
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:34,855
At least get me 1000, mom.

166
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:36,966
l don't have a rupee extra!
Why is he shouting now?

167
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,294
Coming.

168
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:40,094
Mother...
- Take it. That's it.

169
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:40,930
Mother!

170
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:46,607
Liked it, dad?

171
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:49,007
What's this, suddenly?

172
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,943
l thought you've bought a friend's car.

173
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,343
Want to try driving?

174
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:56,177
No, son.
Moreover new car.

175
00:10:56,487 --> 00:11:00,014
l'll drive. Let's go for a drive.
- Okay, son.

176
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:02,785
lt's my favourite colour!
You could've told us, right?

177
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,086
Get in, mom.

178
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:07,287
Brother, come.
Let's go for a drive!

179
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:12,498
Go ahead, l'll..later

180
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,797
Yeah, he's a busy guy.
- Okay, brother.

181
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:17,536
What's the mileage?
- 15, father.

182
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,980
Okay, guys.
We planned to share the party, right?

183
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,087
Take out money.

184
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:37,358
Buddy, l only have Rs.200.

185
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,325
No problem, dude!
l know you're unemployed.

186
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,328
When you get a job!
You can spend!

187
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,592
You keep this money aside.

188
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,826
These guys are all members of
the V.l.P group.

189
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:48,494
None of them are in jobs appropriate
for their qualifications.

190
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:51,664
One works in a call centre,
another takes care of his dad's business.

191
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:53,503
Another guy works as lecturer
in the college he went to.

192
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:55,474
Another guy is an assistant
director in film industry.

193
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:59,480
You should hear the eight class failed director
abusing this engineer graduate.

194
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:03,584
Are you drunk?
- No, sir.

195
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:04,584
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:06,315
Pay the fine.

197
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,390
Fine? Sir, are we driving?
We're just walking.

198
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:12,119
What! Creating public nuisance, eh?

199
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,560
There is no public here.
How can we create nuisance?

200
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,598
Give me your lD cards and
bring your parents in the morning.

201
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:18,359
That's right for you.

202
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:22,563
You look like good boys.
Pay me and push off.

203
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:26,275
What is it?

204
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,934
Sir, we're walking because
we don't have money.

205
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:30,012
ls that so?
Take your mobiles out.

206
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,240
Call your parents!

207
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,443
Stop it.

208
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:36,847
Who is it?

209
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,123
You could have done this sooner.

210
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,118
Wasting my time!

211
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,593
Dude! That was awesome.
You saved in time!

212
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,035
At times Rs.200 given by mother without
father's knowledge is more valuable than 2000.

213
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:27,827
Oh my God!

214
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,940
Life is at crossroads...
Oh my God!

215
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,984
lt's rocking all the sides...
Oh my God!

216
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:46,281
Why are you like this, O my God?
Oh my God!

217
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:49,426
Why do you look at me like a villain?
Oh my God!

218
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:53,586
Hear my problems with heart....

219
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,135
Enough, bro! Shall we wrap it up?

220
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,138
This is just the beginning!

221
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,320
Brother, cool down!

222
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,492
You appear to be on full blast,
tell me what's your problem?

223
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:06,727
Let's hear!

224
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:09,498
My problem is...

225
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:19,679
A Aa E Ee answer is Telugu...
ABCD is English...

226
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:26,119
My fate has turned nonsense which
is written in a language l can't understand...

227
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:32,456
Never gives me a gift to keep it safely...

228
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:38,535
Never bad luck leaves its tight
hold on me...

229
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:41,227
O Supreme Lord!

230
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:51,610
Your cell is full of my missed calls only...

231
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:54,875
You never call me back even once...

232
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:57,850
After giving me a useless birth...

233
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:01,457
You never look at me,
isn't it wrong on your part, God?

234
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:38,250
This boring life...

235
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,590
Problems are ones own!

236
00:16:56,213 --> 00:17:01,116
What will happen at next minute...

237
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:02,941
Mother!

238
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:06,956
My leg!

239
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,691
Looks like neighbour kid.

240
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,919
Shall l drop you home?

241
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:17,055
Oh no! Enough of hitting me...enough...

242
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:18,695
l'll go on my own.

243
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:21,533
Mommy! Oh God!

244
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,705
Generally girls drive like they're drunk.

245
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,068
l'm sure she's drunk and driving.

246
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:31,645
Why are you following me?
- l'll walk you home.

247
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,749
Oh, company?

248
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:36,245
What is your name?

249
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:42,316
You're right. l'm drunk, a stranger.
You shouldn't tell me your name.

250
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,983
My name is Raghuvaran.

251
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:47,556
Know something?

252
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:49,723
My kid brother.

253
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,035
Three years younger to me.

254
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:55,834
Has bought a car!
My dad is so proud!

255
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,936
But l couldn't be happy.

256
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,673
Maybe l'm a little jealous.

257
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:10,110
But what can l do?
lt's all my fate.

258
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:13,754
Why are you walking with me?

259
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,519
That's my fate!

260
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:28,397
We've reached your place.

261
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:29,470
You'll go, right?

262
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,300
We've reached my place?

263
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:33,498
The house next door?

264
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,147
Don't know whose face l saw
today morning!

265
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,258
You, in blue churidhar!
Come here.

266
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:53,759
What?

267
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,623
There's a girl in this house.

268
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,632
Her name is Shalini.

269
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:03,563
She looks like a movie star it seems.
My mother told me.

270
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,338
l even made a telescope and tried to look.

271
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:08,978
But l was unlucky even there.

272
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:12,639
She makes 2 lakhs a month, it seems.

273
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:14,074
Her mother told me.

274
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,548
Why don't you go home?

275
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:17,285
Got a cell phone?

276
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:20,548
Why?

277
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:23,420
l need to call my mom and
ask her to open the gate.

278
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:36,933
Where are you?

279
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,308
l'm coming, wait.

280
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:56,118
Of all the words uttered by lips,
the word 'Mother' is the sweetest...

281
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:58,818
Bitterest word is 'Father'...

282
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:01,423
lsn't the gate locked?

283
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,563
Hey, why are you so late?

284
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,398
Are you drunk?

285
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:09,664
Why are you with him?

286
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,502
He had fallen on road getting drunk.

287
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,140
Fallen drunk?

288
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,438
Why are you embarrassing us?

289
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:17,978
lf your dad finds out, we're dead.

290
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:19,843
Mummy, l didn't drink.

291
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,747
Shut up.
- That girl was drunk and ran over me!

292
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:24,547
Thank God.
What will l do now?

293
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,882
How was the car ride this morning?
- Shut up!

294
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:28,819
Have you eaten?
- l'll slap you.

295
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,060
Be quiet! Got it?

296
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,159
l'll go check on your father.

297
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:45,368
He's asleep.
Go in and sleep quietly.

298
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,600
lf he wakes up, you'll be in trouble.

299
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:49,575
Don't worry, l'll say l've fever.
- l said shut up.

300
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,213
Come quietly.

301
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:53,872
Hold on to me, or you'll fall down!

302
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:56,579
l need pay milkman and paper man.

303
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:58,186
l've left it near prayer table.

304
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,186
Tell the newspaper guy not to
throw the paper on plants.

305
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:02,018
l hate to read wet paper.

306
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:03,887
lf he does that again l won't pay him.

307
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:06,619
How many times l've told him,
yet he does like that only!

308
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,932
Karthik's car is dirty.
Ask sir to wash it.

309
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:12,965
Okay.

310
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,870
Why is he clutching his head?
- He has headache.

311
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,634
What's he done to get headache?
- Don't start off in the morning!

312
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,643
Keep encouraging him like this
he'll get nowhere.

313
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:25,145
What did l encourage now!
- You always do that.

314
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:26,646
Just go, now.

315
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:31,945
You stupid dog!

316
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:34,953
Mom! Why are you hitting me?
- l struggled to get you 200 rupees.

317
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:37,319
And you get drunk?
- Mother!

318
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,121
l asked for 2000.
You only gave me 200 only.

319
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:40,729
You got drunk when l gave you
200 rupees.

320
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,762
lf l'd gave you 2000,
you'd have smoked pot?

321
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:43,729
Answer me.

322
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,095
Mother, are you behaving like mother?
Using words like ''drink'' and ''pot''!

323
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:47,634
l'll hit you with slipper, rascal!

324
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:50,329
You've embarrassed me so much.
- What's so embarrassing?

325
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:53,271
l came quietly and lay down at home, right?
- Lay down at home?

326
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:54,910
You were lying on the road, you fool!

327
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:56,670
The neighbour girl picked you up
and dropped at home.

328
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,371
The neighbour girl?

329
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:01,073
Yes! lt was so embarrassing!

330
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:03,515
Why, don't you remember anything?

331
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:06,654
How will you!
You were drunk to the brim.

332
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,757
lf your dad had known,
he'd have killed you.

333
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:10,825
What?

334
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:15,595
Where's my scooter?

335
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,960
Go look for it where you fell last night.

336
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:19,932
You're so irresponsible!
What if someone takes it?

337
00:22:20,103 --> 00:22:22,094
Cracking jokes!

338
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:23,933
lt must be lying there only.
Go bring it.

339
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:27,372
Look at his walk, still in hangover!

340
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:30,206
He asks me to wash the car
and you agree!

341
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,642
Shut up and go.

342
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:37,853
Even junk buyer too won't be
interested in you!

343
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:52,565
Mother!

344
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:56,233
Again?

345
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:04,411
Careful!

346
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,753
Why's he just walking away silently?

347
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,728
Didn't you hit me with your car last night?
- Not at all.

348
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:26,630
Don't lie to me!

349
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:28,395
Didn't you come in this same car
and hit me yesterday?

350
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:30,870
On top of it, you lied to my mom that
l was lying on the road.

351
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,736
Already my family respects me a lot.

352
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:35,605
Come and tell the truth to my mother.
- Or else what?

353
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:38,543
l'll go to the cops.
- Go. So will l.

354
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:40,344
What will you complain?

355
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:42,382
You looked into my bedroom
with a telescope, right?

356
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:43,780
No! Who said so?

357
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:45,717
You babbled last night
when you were drunk.

358
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:50,184
Think l'm scared of the cops?

359
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,861
My mom said you look like a movie star.
So l looked.

360
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,191
You're not that great.
You're very average.

361
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:58,698
Buzz off. So much drama
for this useless scooter.

362
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:00,464
You call this is useless scooter?

363
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:02,969
My scooter can do 60 kilometers
for one litre. Can your car do that?

364
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:05,404
l'll weave my way through the traffic.
Can you do that?

365
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:08,237
lf it stops, l can just pedal it home.
Can you do that?

366
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:10,311
Go. Start driving with
an ''L'' board first.

367
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,311
Such a cheap guy!

368
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:18,119
Don't you need a bag
to carry the flour back?

369
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:24,389
Hey, coming to play or not?
- l'm coming, brother.

370
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:28,058
Jump over to that compound
and play girls' games with her.

371
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:29,493
Go, brother.

372
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:33,729
l'm batting.

373
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:37,069
Trials, brother.
- Okay, bowl.

374
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:43,135
Are you 2nd classy boys?
Still playing in a plastic ball.

375
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:44,938
You could at least use a tennis ball.

376
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:47,106
Tennis ball would keep falling
on the road.

377
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:49,115
The aunty who lives opposite
would yell if we play on road.

378
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:50,844
Hey, stop blabber, bowl to me.

379
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,348
l'm not talking to you
l'm talking to my brother.

380
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:56,651
l'm not talking to you either
l'm talking to Karthik.

381
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:58,487
Go mind your business.
Don't disturb our match.

382
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:02,359
Yeah, right! lt's lndia-Pak match, right?
You say l distracted.

383
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:05,558
Doesn't your brother have a job?
- He's still trying.

384
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:08,033
Shut it and bowl!

385
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,640
We're all set with the cooking gas, milk guy?

386
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:13,105
Yeah, we're all set.
The neighbour boy helped.

387
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:15,836
Already made friends?
What does he do?

388
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:17,036
His name is Raghuvaran.

389
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,114
He has done engineering
and is jobless.

390
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:20,647
l spoke to his mother yesterday.

391
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:23,445
There are many offers from l.T companies.

392
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:29,024
But he's studied civil engineering and
is determined to do just that.

393
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,617
Poor kid, walks to 10 or 15 companies
for interview every month.

394
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:03,154
What?

395
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:05,590
For what?

396
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:09,928
For calling you jobless yesterday.

397
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,795
And for hitting your vehicle.

398
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:13,936
And lying to your mom.

399
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:16,667
That's okay.

400
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:21,541
l'm sorry, too.
- For what?

401
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,679
For looking into your house
with a telescope.

402
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:25,838
For saying you're an average
looking girl.

403
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,246
lf not a movie star,
you look a T.V star.

404
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:35,186
Look at our superstar...

405
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:40,057
He's rocking with one side love...

406
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,754
Should l get it every week?

407
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,398
lf l get chicken,
all three of you too eat, right?

408
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:44,965
Won't you send this idiot even once?

409
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,569
He's free only on Sunday, right?

410
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:50,262
For your dirty face,
you want to read newspaper too!

411
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:51,132
Can't you go shopping?

412
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:53,367
l said l'll go brother
but father told me take rest.

413
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:55,477
Touch the chicken,
l'll cut your hand.

414
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:14,625
Look at our superstar...

415
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,428
He's switching on the romantic gear...

416
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:24,505
Can Teddy bear speak?
Can Barbie doll sing?

417
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:30,306
Can you find black colour in rainbow?

418
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:59,874
He's raising dust with his
love magnetic power...

419
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:04,912
Even if Google goes away...
Even if Facebook gets shut down...

420
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:10,212
Can your love ever win, Raghuvaran?

421
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:15,086
Can mobile phones work without SlM card?

422
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:20,161
Will BBC channel telecast
TV show Chitrahar?

423
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:25,791
Will good Friday ever come
on a Sunday?

424
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,573
How many interviews did you face
till now, brother?

425
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:35,503
What happened, brother?

426
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:38,476
These guys take up their dad's business
without any experience.

427
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:40,775
And put the life of we,
engineers at stake.

428
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,145
lf they have money why not go abroad
to enjoy instead of killing us.

429
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:10,275
Why did you give up ancestral
property so easily?

430
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:13,314
What could l do?
They've bought all surrounding areas.

431
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:16,282
First l fought and then begged
to retain it.

432
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:19,183
First they cut my electricity.
And then stopped water supply.

433
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:22,620
Now they cut milk, paper and gas supply.
l can't fight them.

434
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:23,918
We can't take on them.

435
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:26,357
You've snatched it away!
You'll get ruined!

436
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:27,553
What is it, dad?

437
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,689
You spent 3 months.
For this small piece of land.

438
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:37,398
lf we ignore small properties.
We will not be sitting here.

439
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:39,201
Every inch of land is important.

440
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:44,306
lf we want we should buy it.
lf not, we should snatch it.

441
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:45,379
You should learn this.

442
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,743
You are going to take over the
company in 2 months.

443
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:51,751
l am going to look after
our branches in US.

444
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:07,396
l asked you to design for nine floors.
But you've designed for six!

445
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,403
Sir, the FSl allows only six floors, sir.

446
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:12,473
l know all that.

447
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:16,406
But the extra 30 or 40 lakhs bribe we pay
for these three extra floors, right?

448
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:19,480
We want engineers who can do
what we want!

449
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,047
But that's wrong, sir.

450
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:25,517
We've studied engineering
to avoid all that, sir.

451
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,116
Sir, my plan?

452
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,488
You can take it with you.

453
00:31:31,154 --> 00:31:34,123
l've approached every company and
met everyone in 4 these years.

454
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,349
l haven't got the chance
to even build a petty shop!

455
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:38,721
l can prove myself only
if l get a chance, right?

456
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:40,920
You could try some other job?

457
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:46,160
Yes but the 30 or 40 grand every month
would kill the engineer in me.

458
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:50,499
lf l settle for the money,
then all my dreams would go for a toss.

459
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:53,574
l should just go to Bangalore
or Hyderabad.

460
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,676
Go wherever you want.
But after the end of next month.

461
00:31:56,846 --> 00:32:00,282
Why? Will l get a job by then?
- l don't know about that.

462
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,283
But next month 30th is my birthday.
Stay here till then.

463
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,712
lt's okay if l leave after that?

464
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,584
You want to leave anyway.
Then go after my birthday.

465
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:11,487
For this birthday,
l should gift myself an apple.

466
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:16,394
You silly girl!
Why wait till birthday to buy an apple!

467
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:19,034
There are many in my home,
l'll get you one today evening

468
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:22,103
Hey mad boy!
l meant Apple's iPhone.

469
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:22,965
Come.

470
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:34,976
Brother?

471
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:36,814
Switch on the fan.

472
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:39,477
ldle pig makes his brother
turn the fan on.

473
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:40,415
Yes, brother?

474
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:43,958
How much would an iPhone cost?
- 35 to 40 thousand.

475
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,152
When did he get home last night?
- Around 1 1 pm.

476
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:49,298
lt was 1 1 :30 pm when l went to bed!
He didn't come till then.

477
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:50,397
Go away.

478
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:52,898
l didn't see the time when he came.
- You're losing track with him.

479
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,661
40000!

480
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:57,535
You've come to your little brother
to get money from him.

481
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:59,163
Why hesitate now?

482
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:03,173
He learnt to walk holding my hand,
how can l ask money from him?

483
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:06,408
l'm asking you to do night shift,
are you ignoring me?

484
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,243
How dare you complain to team leader!

485
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:11,011
Aren't you afraid of Paidithalli gang?

486
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:12,484
Tell me....tell me...

487
00:33:12,622 --> 00:33:14,021
Will you complain against me?

488
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,282
l'll hit you...

489
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,186
Who are you?

490
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,291
What?

491
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,521
Who is that? Raising your voice!
Come here.

492
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:28,661
Ht him!
- Brother! Please no!

493
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:30,133
l'm with you, hit him.
- No please, brother.

494
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:31,637
l said, hit him!

495
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,838
Go sit down.
Go!

496
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:42,239
You've grown tall like temple mast!
Won't you hit back?

497
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:43,510
Go do your job.

498
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:49,319
Come..come...welcome...

499
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,386
l'm very happy about your arrival...

500
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,996
Who are you people?
What do you want?

501
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:56,893
Are you Karthik's older brother?

502
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,695
He's my little brother.

503
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:01,965
lt's the same thing.

504
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:08,004
You're thin like a bean pole,
trying to get smart with us?

505
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:09,906
Break his nose!

506
00:34:18,821 --> 00:34:22,279
Oh my gosh! Who are you people!
Why are you hitting my boy?

507
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,516
Don't hit him!

508
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:24,853
Somebody call the cops!

509
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:27,291
Stop hitting him!
Don't hit him!

510
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:30,296
What will l do now?
Your dad too is not in home.

511
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:32,093
Stop!
Don't hit him!

512
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:34,532
What did you say?
Dad's not in home?

513
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:35,329
Yes.

514
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:36,368
Hey, stop!

515
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:39,235
Wait...wait a minute...wait...wait...

516
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:43,504
What's happened to you?
- lt's nothing! Wait.

517
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:48,948
What is he doing?
- Don't know.

518
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:51,616
Who are you people?
Don't you've brothers?

519
00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:53,722
We've, aunty.
They've gone to hit another guy.

520
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:55,515
Shut up, man!

521
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:57,951
What happened? Why are they hitting you?

522
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,061
Call yourself a mother?
- Why?

523
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:02,288
Won't tell me sooner that dad's not in home?

524
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:04,160
Would he have let this happen?

525
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,460
He'd have beaten the crap out of all of you.

526
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:09,996
Go stand aside.

527
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:11,969
Go!
- Are you going to fight?

528
00:35:14,877 --> 00:35:17,573
l'll give you people thirty seconds.

529
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:21,979
Apologize to me and my mother for
hitting me and run the hell out of here.

530
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:24,085
lf not...?
- What will you do?

531
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:25,311
l will hit you!

532
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:47,409
Raghu, behind you!

533
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:55,573
Hey, fall over there.

534
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:58,344
My flower pot!

535
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:01,083
Put the flower pot down.

536
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:03,348
You bull! Put the flower pot down.

537
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,089
Oh no!

538
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,099
He broke my flower pot!
Smash his face!

539
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:12,798
My wedding is 10 days away, sir.

540
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:16,097
l came for marriage expenses.
Please don't hit on my face, sir.

541
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:18,573
Buzz off! Discussion amidst a fight.

542
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,845
Oh no! A knife!

543
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:11,652
Who are those people?
Why did they hit you?

544
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:13,351
What do you have to do with goons?

545
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:14,496
l've been hanging out with them!

546
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:15,789
What should be your dialogue as a mom?

547
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,489
''Oh dear, are you hurt?''

548
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,601
What happened?
Who are those people?

549
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:24,533
ls it you?
Are you hurt?

550
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:26,504
l thought it was them, mom.

551
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:27,835
Are you not bleeding?

552
00:37:29,678 --> 00:37:32,875
Where's the logic in this?
l don't understand.

553
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:37,008
lf a goon hits another,
there's some logic to it.

554
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:41,020
lf a politician hits another,
l can see logic in it.

555
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,956
Why should someone come and
hit someone sitting idle at home?

556
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,788
He must have done something.

557
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,892
Violence was all that was left.

558
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:55,368
His little brother is struggling so hard,
shouldn't he be determined to help him.

559
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,704
Even last week there was an offer
at a call centre for 50000.

560
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:00,341
He could have taken it!

561
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:02,704
How long will he keep waiting to build?

562
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:05,039
As if he's straightforward.

563
00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:08,411
When we were in college,
l was two years his junior.

564
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:12,918
Two boys made fun of me.
He hit them and was locked up for two days.

565
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:13,850
Wow!

566
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:17,390
Like l'm tying this red thread
around your wrist,

567
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,924
l tied a similar one around his wrist.

568
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:23,724
And made him promise not to
hit anyone as long as its there.

569
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:28,268
He hasn't hit anyone since then.
Not even you boys.

570
00:38:28,437 --> 00:38:31,463
So brother can't hit anyone from now?
- Yes.

571
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,267
Then l'm safe!

572
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:36,476
Even last week there was an offer
at a call centre for 50000.

573
00:38:36,645 --> 00:38:37,737
He could've taken it.

574
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:07,598
You don't need to take that job
if you're so unwilling.

575
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,244
You're waiting this long.
A few more days won't hurt.

576
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:12,505
That's okay.

577
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:19,047
ls it lodge to take rest?

578
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:26,954
Your salary has been credited
to your account, Mr. Raghuvaran.

579
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:29,563
Then, l resign.
- Why?

580
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:30,756
l need to buy an iPhone.

581
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:34,132
What did l ask him?

582
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:37,636
What's up? Where are you going?

583
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:41,242
Here's this month's salary 10000.

584
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:44,510
10000?
But your salary is 50000, right?

585
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,238
l need the 40000 for my expenses, mom.

586
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:47,643
What will l tell your father?

587
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:51,149
Tell him whatever you want.
Also tell him that l've quit the job.

588
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,916
What? You quit? Why!

589
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:58,249
Don't know what the hell he'll raise!

590
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:00,753
Brother!

591
00:40:01,797 --> 00:40:02,320
What?

592
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:05,592
Please, brother. Help me somehow.

593
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,429
What happened?

594
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:13,439
l took forty thousand from dad
to pay fees for my MBA course went by car.

595
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:15,839
l went to a shop to buy a shirt.

596
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:19,511
Someone stole the money
from my car, brother.

597
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:22,809
How am l to pay the fees?
l'm confused, brother.

598
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:26,084
lt's your money.
Be brave! Tell them you lost it.

599
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:28,415
No, brother.
Dad would mistake me.

600
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:30,525
l will tell them.
- Brother, no please!

601
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:32,820
l don't want to hurt father.

602
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:34,961
What do you want me to do now?

603
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:37,190
lf you have any money with you?

604
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:39,823
Please, brother!

605
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:41,793
l don't have!

606
00:40:57,486 --> 00:40:59,852
Keep it. Take it.

607
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:04,823
Brother, it doesn't matter
who starts earning first.

608
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:08,395
What matters is who earns
at the right time. Understand?

609
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:34,179
Why so late?

610
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:38,087
l could have bought a more expensive gift.

611
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,490
But it would be artificial.

612
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:43,655
Rose would be personal and lively.

613
00:42:54,803 --> 00:42:55,599
What is it?

614
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:56,702
Take it.

615
00:42:57,606 --> 00:42:59,198
Open it after l've left.

616
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:55,119
You quit your job?

617
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:57,827
Yes.

618
00:43:58,801 --> 00:43:59,495
Why?

619
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:03,066
You said that other day

620
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:06,138
That it's okay to wait.
lt won't hurt much.

621
00:44:13,148 --> 00:44:14,479
You only gave ten grand?

622
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:21,346
Go.

623
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:39,266
That man let me get away so easily?

624
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:42,501
l expected a big fight!
He didn't say anything, why?

625
00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:44,869
l'll not get clarity till
l smoke a cigarette.

626
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:20,476
You're smoking?

627
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:27,385
Don't say sorry!

628
00:45:28,156 --> 00:45:30,317
You've earned 50000.

629
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:33,222
Spent 40000 in one day and
gave 10000 to home.

630
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:36,923
Why should you say sorry?
Why should you smoke in hiding?

631
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:39,363
You can blow the smoke on my face.
No problem.

632
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:40,331
What's the issue now?

633
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:43,494
That l'm smoking or
that l didn't give 40000?

634
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:46,368
You think if you don't give 40000
this household will not run?

635
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:50,137
First l was toiling alone,
now your brother has joined me.

636
00:45:50,312 --> 00:45:51,244
That's the difference.

637
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:52,912
Who needs your money?

638
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:54,571
lf you'd given the 50000 to your mother.

639
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,844
Taken her blessings,
taken it and blown it away.

640
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,282
l would have been very happy.

641
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:03,385
Your little brother needs
to pay fees for his MBA.

642
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,287
He makes a lakh every month.

643
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:07,793
He could have gone and
paid as he wishes. lt's his money.

644
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:11,262
But he gets it from me and
pays after getting my permission.

645
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:13,528
That's how you show respect.

646
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:17,133
He's a real son.
- Why are you comparing him with me?

647
00:46:18,373 --> 00:46:20,170
You did what he wanted,
what did you do for me?

648
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:23,872
You put him in a convent
but l went to a Govt. school.

649
00:46:24,046 --> 00:46:27,015
l struggle to speak in English
in interviews.

650
00:46:27,182 --> 00:46:30,151
You keep saying l don't get a job!
How will l?

651
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:32,144
l can't even do a presentation properly.

652
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:33,879
l could only afford that much back then.

653
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:36,889
After that you shifted him
to English medium, right?

654
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:40,153
You could have shifted me, too!
Why didn't you?

655
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:43,826
So much partiality!

656
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:45,158
You keep comparing, deriding!

657
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:46,460
Why do you compare?

658
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:48,467
Even our names!

659
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,071
His name is hero Karthik!
My name is villain Raghuvaran!

660
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:58,241
lf he's so special you could
have just had him.

661
00:46:58,413 --> 00:46:59,038
Why did you have me?

662
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:00,408
What could we do?

663
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:03,779
You were born to us first.
He was born after that.

664
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:12,188
At least you've admitted that
you feel this way.

665
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,955
You wish l wasn't born.
ls that what you mean?

666
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,425
lt's my body. My life.

667
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:19,395
l'll smoke cigarettes and
do whatever l want.

668
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:20,262
What's your problem?

669
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:23,996
Watch your tongue!
lt's getting out of control.

670
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:25,332
Like what?

671
00:47:25,674 --> 00:47:27,301
What will happen?

672
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:29,034
You'll ask me to get out of the house...

673
00:47:34,616 --> 00:47:39,781
You smoke, drink, go for a job, or don't.
l don't care.

674
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:44,153
But if you raise your voice to him
or speak disrespectfully.

675
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:46,622
l'll kill you. Get lost!

676
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:14,053
Mom and dad are very fond of you, brother.

677
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,854
He spoke like that because
he was angry.

678
00:48:17,826 --> 00:48:19,657
Don't feel bad.

679
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:24,294
You know how dad gets emotional
even for little things.

680
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,996
Don't take it to your heart, brother.

681
00:48:29,538 --> 00:48:32,166
So much was happening downstairs.

682
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,673
You didn't open your mouth to say
that l gave you the money for your fees.

683
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:37,368
You've run upstairs and hid yourself.

684
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:38,774
Are you preaching me now?

685
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:40,881
Shut up or else l'll smash your face.

686
00:48:58,033 --> 00:48:58,761
Sit.

687
00:49:04,906 --> 00:49:06,464
You're the good son.

688
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:08,532
l'm the bad son.

689
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:13,047
l'm a martyr!

690
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:19,152
Do you drink?
- Oh no, brother.

691
00:49:28,897 --> 00:49:30,228
You'll drink coke?

692
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:32,163
Okay, brother.

693
00:49:33,802 --> 00:49:34,496
Drink!

694
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:43,602
lt's diet coke.
You haven't had it before?

695
00:49:44,746 --> 00:49:47,146
This is how it would be.
Drink....drink...

696
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:54,250
Brother!

697
00:49:55,524 --> 00:49:56,752
Want to have a peg?

698
00:49:56,925 --> 00:49:58,586
Already on it.

699
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:05,791
How long for the construction to get over?
- Three more months.

700
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,264
You've been building for so long!

701
00:50:07,435 --> 00:50:09,596
Useless engineer.

702
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:14,871
Useless engineer too got a chance.

703
00:50:15,076 --> 00:50:17,044
But l'm sitting here on terrace.

704
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:21,514
l just called you for company.

705
00:50:31,893 --> 00:50:35,886
Zero luck...

706
00:50:36,064 --> 00:50:39,932
Life is dull...

707
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:44,265
Solo heart is sad...

708
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:47,897
At least l want full kick with drinks...

709
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:51,705
l'm zero with no value...

710
00:50:51,913 --> 00:50:56,247
l'm a good man grown strong with
soul using me as punch bag...

711
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:59,979
l'm a fool who lost everything...

712
00:51:00,155 --> 00:51:04,819
l'm like the phoenix which rises from ash...

713
00:51:04,993 --> 00:51:06,961
My sorrow is my intoxication...

714
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:09,028
l'm a king of dust...

715
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,256
My fate is dark and black...

716
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:15,369
l'm a kite stuck in the tree branch...

717
00:51:15,537 --> 00:51:17,835
l'm a sorrow stricken king...

718
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,442
What's his problem?
- Nothing, you go inside.

719
00:51:57,612 --> 00:51:59,307
What will neighbours think about us?

720
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:00,209
We can discuss tomorrow morning?

721
00:52:00,382 --> 00:52:01,781
He's singing as if he'll
become a great singer.

722
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:19,390
Though love is everywhere,
l'm denied even a bit of it...

723
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:27,133
Though l'm young man with heart,
l don't see any girl willing to be my partner...

724
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:31,575
l've left my shame and
sensitivity to wind...

725
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:35,682
Pushing away the time with
artificial smiles...

726
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:39,810
Nobody likes me if l live life
on my own terms...

727
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:44,651
Without showing to the world
l cried in myself...

728
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:39,871
Come here.

729
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:44,477
Bye.

730
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:56,359
What's your problem?
Why do you drink like this?

731
00:53:56,531 --> 00:53:59,261
My life is ruined.

732
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:02,196
Raghuvaran, failure.

733
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:03,200
What happened?

734
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:04,429
My mother!

735
00:54:05,006 --> 00:54:09,773
Slapped me so hard.
l did nothing wrong.

736
00:54:10,245 --> 00:54:12,440
Mom, dad and a younger brother.

737
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:14,639
All three of them have abandoned me.

738
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:16,814
Why do you talk like this?

739
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:19,215
Your mom hit you, right?

740
00:54:20,021 --> 00:54:23,752
Ask people who don't have mothers.
They'll tell you what a pleasant thing it is.

741
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,192
What a dialogue!

742
00:54:29,664 --> 00:54:31,632
You'd know if you'd been in my house.

743
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:33,457
They make comparisons all the time!

744
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:37,594
He works, you don't.
He makes money, you don't.

745
00:54:37,772 --> 00:54:40,605
He's bought a car,
you didn't buy toy car also.

746
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:44,267
When l was in tenth class,
he grew taller than me.

747
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:49,247
My dad told me back then,
he's eating right and is growing tall.

748
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:50,941
But you're waste.

749
00:54:51,152 --> 00:54:54,417
How can l help it if that
moron keeps growing taller!

750
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:56,318
He said that because
he cares about you.

751
00:54:56,491 --> 00:55:00,894
Care about me?

752
00:55:01,896 --> 00:55:03,124
You wouldn't know.

753
00:55:03,298 --> 00:55:05,266
You're the only child in your house.

754
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:11,736
ln my house, they discriminate
even in names.

755
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,900
He's got a hero's name Karthik.
And l a villain's name Raghuvaran.

756
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:21,143
l like Raghuvaran more than Karthik.

757
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:26,716
You mean?

758
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:29,287
l mean it.

759
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,533
Your relatives don't like me.
Nor do l they like them.

760
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:51,210
Why do you ask me to go
for that wedding?

761
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:52,641
That too all the way in Narasaraopet!

762
00:55:52,814 --> 00:55:55,146
l'm not feeling well
if not l would've gone myself.

763
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:59,275
Then why don't you just lie down?
Why are you doing all this work?

764
00:55:59,988 --> 00:56:01,785
l'll take care of it.

765
00:56:01,956 --> 00:56:04,550
You take Karthik for company and go.

766
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:06,159
ls Karthik my company?

767
00:56:06,327 --> 00:56:08,056
Take our elder one, then.

768
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,928
Don't insult me by calling
as our elder one.

769
00:56:12,066 --> 00:56:14,034
Yes, the older one.

770
00:56:14,636 --> 00:56:19,039
Lakshmi, you shouldn't have hit Raghu.

771
00:56:19,707 --> 00:56:21,766
He's a man now.

772
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:25,645
What, then?
He threatens to leave home.

773
00:56:25,813 --> 00:56:27,246
You'll get angry and ask him to.

774
00:56:27,415 --> 00:56:30,213
He'll pack his bag and
go to the street end.

775
00:56:30,385 --> 00:56:34,048
Who'll go after him then?
l would've to go.

776
00:56:34,255 --> 00:56:36,883
lf l hadn't hit him,
that's what would've happened.

777
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:38,554
Great!

778
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:50,431
Karthik and l are going
to Narasaraopet this evening.

779
00:56:50,605 --> 00:56:53,369
Mother is not feeling well.
Stay home and be of help to her.

780
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:56,871
You won't have any work outside anyway.

781
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,672
lf you do have, stay in home.

782
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,445
We'll be back by tomorrow evening.

783
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:07,950
You should've slapped him twice more.

784
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:25,801
Take offering.

785
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,114
Greetings!

786
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:37,807
Meditating?

787
00:57:38,052 --> 00:57:40,953
Yes, had a fight in home.

788
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:42,217
l know.

789
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,319
Your mom hit you, right?

790
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:48,086
l won't speak to her at least
for 2 or 3 months.

791
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:52,390
How do you know that my mom hit me?

792
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:54,225
You told me last night!

793
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:56,058
When?

794
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:58,598
You even sang and danced on terrace.

795
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,977
You don't remember anything?

796
00:58:04,979 --> 00:58:07,504
l was talking to brother.

797
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:09,979
l did sing a song...

798
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:12,513
You won't remember anything
if you get drunk?

799
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:16,150
l said something very important.

800
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:18,353
Your loss!

801
00:58:19,427 --> 00:58:21,861
What did you say?
l don't remember anything!

802
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:24,829
You forgot, right? Get lost.

803
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:27,593
Please, tell me what you said.

804
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:29,363
Are you free tomorrow?

805
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:33,536
Don't you know me at all?
l'm always free.

806
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:34,606
Please, tell me what you said.

807
00:58:34,776 --> 00:58:37,176
Take me out, to make up for forgetting.

808
00:58:37,378 --> 00:58:38,538
l'll tell you then.

809
00:58:40,548 --> 00:58:41,173
Okay.

810
00:58:43,651 --> 00:58:46,711
l've given my car for service.
You'll have to pick me up.

811
00:58:48,156 --> 00:58:48,815
Okay.

812
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:05,195
How will l pick her up on this!

813
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:11,901
l can't just give you a bike, Raghu!

814
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,174
Please, Pandu! l'll return it in two hours.
- Two hours!?

815
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,443
l'll be in trouble if the owner finds out.

816
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:19,745
Please, Pandu.
We're such good friends!

817
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:21,218
Friends?

818
00:59:21,422 --> 00:59:23,754
We played cricket together
while in tenth class.

819
00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:25,688
lt took me 10 minutes to recognise you.

820
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,819
Just for one time only, Pandu.
Won't do this for me?

821
00:59:29,964 --> 00:59:31,693
You're a pain!

822
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:34,165
Must bring it back in two hours!

823
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:36,929
l promise on my mother.
- Okay, come take it in the morning.

824
00:59:42,377 --> 00:59:43,503
Where's Pandu?

825
00:59:43,678 --> 00:59:46,203
Don't ask me about him.
His girl came in the morning.

826
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:49,043
He downed the shutter and
rode away with her.

827
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:50,616
Goddamn you!

828
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:57,519
What are you looking for?

829
00:59:58,292 --> 00:59:59,259
Nothing short in this arrogance.

830
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,893
lf you don't want to talk, don't talk!

831
01:00:10,037 --> 01:00:13,097
My fate.
l've to travel on this.

832
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,764
l shouldn't have insulted you.

833
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:43,832
l shouldn't have gone after another bike.

834
01:00:44,038 --> 01:00:46,302
But don't take revenge on me now.
- What has happened to him?

835
01:00:46,474 --> 01:00:49,307
Please start today! Please!

836
01:01:08,062 --> 01:01:09,586
Why your shirt is wet?

837
01:01:09,964 --> 01:01:12,057
Coming straight from gym.
- ls it?

838
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:14,868
Will this pull two of us?

839
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:16,697
l've towed lorries with this!

840
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:32,613
l've brought you out now.
Tell me what you said the other day.

841
01:01:32,787 --> 01:01:35,187
You call this taking me out?
- Then?

842
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:39,088
Take me out for lunch.
l'll tell you.

843
01:01:43,164 --> 01:01:43,892
Have you eaten?

844
01:01:44,966 --> 01:01:46,228
ls your stomach full?

845
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:50,002
Tell me now.
What did you say that night?

846
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,467
Take me to the beach, l'll tell you.

847
01:01:57,245 --> 01:02:00,078
Had a good look.
This is beach.

848
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:01,942
Tell me now.
What did you say the other night?

849
01:02:02,116 --> 01:02:07,076
Take me for a good movie
and l'll tell you.

850
01:02:07,588 --> 01:02:11,752
You don't need to tell me.
- Wait, l'll tell you.

851
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:19,332
l said l like Raghuvaran more
than Karthik.

852
01:02:21,002 --> 01:02:22,663
Okay.
- That's it.

853
01:02:23,004 --> 01:02:23,993
That's it?

854
01:02:25,106 --> 01:02:26,869
You made me run around for this?

855
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:28,668
What more do you want?

856
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,017
Why do you keep your face like that?
- My face is like that.

857
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,850
Okay, listen.

858
01:02:49,096 --> 01:02:50,961
Take the call, please.

859
01:02:51,165 --> 01:02:51,859
No problem, its mom.

860
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:53,728
So what if it's mom?
Talk to her.

861
01:02:53,901 --> 01:02:55,425
l told you, l fought with her.
We're not talking.

862
01:02:55,636 --> 01:02:57,900
This is too childish.
Talk to her first

863
01:02:58,072 --> 01:03:00,131
This is normal in my family.

864
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,037
l expected something more.
- Like what?

865
01:03:04,211 --> 01:03:07,806
l thought it would be
something very important.

866
01:03:07,982 --> 01:03:11,383
Why don't you assume l meant
that important thing?

867
01:03:11,552 --> 01:03:12,951
How can think like that!

868
01:03:15,656 --> 01:03:18,284
Please talk to your mom.
l'll tell you later.

869
01:03:21,295 --> 01:03:22,728
Okay, l'll drop you.

870
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:27,334
l have an appointment at three.
l've to be on time.

871
01:03:27,468 --> 01:03:31,165
l won't make it of l go on your bike.
l've called a friend.

872
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:46,081
You don't allow me to live
peaceful in home.

873
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,413
You won't let something good
happen to me outside also?

874
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:21,785
Sunny....sunny stop...

875
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:23,218
Leave me.

876
01:04:24,692 --> 01:04:26,125
Why didn't you answer her call?

877
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:29,452
What happened?
- Tell me, why didn't you answer her call?

878
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:32,693
Mother called you because
she had chest pain.

879
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:35,995
You could've answered her call,
when we came, saw her lying on the floor.

880
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,694
She's dead, brother!

881
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,397
Why did you come?
- Calm down, brother-in-law!

882
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,168
Why did you come now?
- Calm down...

883
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:18,505
Let me go.
l'll kill you!

884
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:20,772
l'll kill him today!

885
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:24,349
Calm down, brother-in-law!

886
01:05:24,885 --> 01:05:26,284
Why are you shouting at him?

887
01:05:26,454 --> 01:05:29,082
What did she do wrong,
except give birth to you?

888
01:05:29,256 --> 01:05:32,054
She's no more. She died!

889
01:05:32,193 --> 01:05:34,855
What will l do now?
What was my sin?

890
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:37,896
l asked you to stay!
l asked you to stay in home.

891
01:05:38,065 --> 01:05:39,532
What will l do now?

892
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:45,036
Why are you standing like rock?
Look at her!

893
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:47,606
You killed her!

894
01:05:57,952 --> 01:06:02,218
Mother, l'm your child...

895
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:06,883
l'm dejected without you, mother...

896
01:06:07,461 --> 01:06:11,921
You vanished without speaking a word...

897
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:16,297
The wound in my heart is shedding tears...

898
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:24,809
You left me alone and
went away somewhere...

899
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:30,110
O mother, can l hear your lullaby again?

900
01:06:30,284 --> 01:06:37,747
lf you open your eyes for my lullaby,
that's enough for me...

901
01:07:23,804 --> 01:07:28,173
The lamp got put off...
you melted away...

902
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:32,904
O mother, why are you so angry on me?

903
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:37,517
My world is nothing but
a sea of sorrows...

904
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:42,088
Void is laughing at me...

905
01:07:42,256 --> 01:07:51,722
Why am l the cursed like this?
ls it sins of my past life?

906
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:56,335
Even my day time is taken over
by dark night of sorrows...

907
01:07:56,503 --> 01:08:01,099
The pitch darkness is scaring me...

908
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:05,712
My breath has left me like you...

909
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,213
What's there for me to live anymore?

910
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:33,303
This is the house, sir.

911
01:08:38,178 --> 01:08:39,145
Come, let's go, dead.

912
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,714
How long will you suffer alone like this?

913
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:44,881
l too didn't want to disturb you.

914
01:08:45,619 --> 01:08:48,053
But you haven't shed a single tear.

915
01:08:48,522 --> 01:08:50,422
Cry, the burden will ease.

916
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:52,658
Talk to your dad.

917
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,751
Brother, dad called you.

918
01:09:01,201 --> 01:09:02,429
My name is Ramprasad.

919
01:09:02,803 --> 01:09:05,499
Your wife had donated her organs.

920
01:09:06,774 --> 01:09:07,968
This is my daughter.
She's a C.O.P.D. patient.

921
01:09:10,077 --> 01:09:12,568
l mean, she already had very weak lungs.

922
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,010
They said she needed
lung transplant to live.

923
01:09:15,182 --> 01:09:16,911
We almost gave up hope on her.

924
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:19,678
Your wife's lungs gave
my daughter a new life.

925
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,085
My daughter is alive because
of your mother.

926
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,251
That's why we came personally
to thank you.

927
01:09:25,426 --> 01:09:28,918
lf you want anything.. anything at all.

928
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:31,189
l'm feeling a little delicate to ask you.

929
01:09:31,632 --> 01:09:32,656
We don't want anything.

930
01:09:33,467 --> 01:09:36,527
My mother gave your daughter new life,
that's enough.

931
01:09:37,004 --> 01:09:38,938
l never used to listen to my mother's words.

932
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:41,942
Never expected this would happen.

933
01:09:42,142 --> 01:09:43,473
Not even imagined in my dream.

934
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:47,045
Please take care of your health, madam.

935
01:09:52,519 --> 01:09:54,953
We'll come back later.
Let's go, dear.

936
01:09:58,826 --> 01:10:00,123
l killed you!

937
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:02,790
You died because of me.

938
01:10:04,131 --> 01:10:07,123
lf l'd taken the call, you would have lived!

939
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:12,871
lts better that even l die.

940
01:10:13,707 --> 01:10:15,698
Stop crying!

941
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:17,841
What's the point in crying now?

942
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:20,479
So many times l didn't answer her calls.

943
01:10:20,647 --> 01:10:23,480
lf she'd died then,
would it mean l killed her?

944
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:24,877
What could you've done?

945
01:10:55,849 --> 01:11:00,343
Though l can't live without you,
l'm separated from you...

946
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:04,924
Am l not merged in your breath?

947
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:09,585
l'm living forgetting the death...

948
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:14,223
Wherever l may be,
l'm always with your thoughts...

949
01:11:14,401 --> 01:11:23,901
l dream you than face reality...

950
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:28,511
Would time be the same always?

951
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:33,142
Don't fill eyes with tears...

952
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:37,814
Fending off the savage autumn...

953
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:42,054
l'll join you as the new sprout...

954
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:56,442
l'm walking every step with you...

955
01:11:56,610 --> 01:12:00,671
l see only you in my mirror...

956
01:12:00,848 --> 01:12:08,983
O you've left me forever...
Your life is my smile...

957
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:14,684
O mother, can l hear your lullaby again?

958
01:12:14,862 --> 01:12:21,995
l'll become wind that touches sky
and sing lullaby for you always...

959
01:12:28,675 --> 01:12:31,838
l got a bit emotional that day.
So l couldn't speak.

960
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,141
l came to know you're trying for job.

961
01:12:35,315 --> 01:12:36,942
Dad is also in construction field.

962
01:12:37,117 --> 01:12:40,712
lf you don't mind, could you meet
ad at his office tomorrow?

963
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:43,685
No, please.
- Please, my dad

964
01:12:43,857 --> 01:12:46,485
No! l'll manage on my own.

965
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,127
Won't you do this for me please?

966
01:13:16,256 --> 01:13:18,247
Rajusundaram, would you please come in?

967
01:13:23,163 --> 01:13:24,994
l'd asked for the slum clearance
project details.

968
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:26,632
l've kept it on your table already, sir.

969
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,702
After working in this office for ten long years,
l'm finally getting my own project!

970
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:31,997
Ask Raghuvaran to come.

971
01:13:32,172 --> 01:13:33,366
Why is he calling him?

972
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:37,010
Oh, l need an assistant, right?

973
01:13:38,078 --> 01:13:40,171
After this project,
l must start my own company.

974
01:13:44,017 --> 01:13:46,008
Swarnapushpam!
- Hubby!

975
01:13:46,186 --> 01:13:47,915
Make pudding today evening.
- Okay, dear.

976
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:49,613
l'm coming home with good news.

977
01:13:50,057 --> 01:13:50,682
Nothing like that...

978
01:13:52,659 --> 01:13:54,388
Raghuvaran, Chairman is calling you.

979
01:13:54,661 --> 01:13:55,593
What's the matter, sir?

980
01:13:55,762 --> 01:13:59,095
lt's some new slum clearance
involves crores of rupees.

981
01:13:59,266 --> 01:14:00,358
l don't know who's getting the job.

982
01:14:01,101 --> 01:14:02,227
lt must be about that.

983
01:14:02,402 --> 01:14:04,267
lf it's such a huge project, it'll go to
the senior most person in the office.

984
01:14:04,438 --> 01:14:05,268
And that's you.

985
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,703
Sir, congrats! You never told me!

986
01:14:07,874 --> 01:14:10,308
Nothing has been confirmed yet.
Why already...

987
01:14:11,078 --> 01:14:12,636
But why did he ask me to come?

988
01:14:14,748 --> 01:14:15,646
Don't you get it?

989
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:18,283
Sir, your assistant!

990
01:14:19,419 --> 01:14:23,355
Sir, when he appoints me as your assistant,
please don't refuse!

991
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:26,284
Don't worry. No matter what happens,
you'll be my assistant.

992
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,758
The government has announced
a slum clearance project.

993
01:14:28,929 --> 01:14:30,419
We need to submit the tender in a week.

994
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:32,724
We don't want even a rupee profit
from this project.

995
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:34,833
We're doing it for the poor.

996
01:14:35,168 --> 01:14:36,499
All the details are in this file.

997
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,467
Take a look and prepare budget carefully.

998
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:39,833
Why the file is going that side?

999
01:14:41,508 --> 01:14:42,805
Sir, why are you giving this to me?

1000
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:44,238
lt's your project, you should do it!

1001
01:14:44,411 --> 01:14:45,400
Did he ask me to bring him for this?

1002
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:46,807
Sir, l've only been working here
for six months only.

1003
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,072
How can l handle such a big project?

1004
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:50,808
To know if rice is cooked,
testing one grain is enough.

1005
01:14:50,984 --> 01:14:53,509
l've been boiling here for 10 years now.

1006
01:14:53,687 --> 01:14:55,518
Didn't you want to test my grain?

1007
01:14:55,689 --> 01:14:58,249
l can't believe it, sir.
l don't know how to thank you.

1008
01:14:58,425 --> 01:15:01,917
That's not necessary
Just complete the project, that's all.

1009
01:15:02,095 --> 01:15:06,657
Sundaram, you can be Raghuvaran's
assistant in this project.

1010
01:15:15,809 --> 01:15:19,540
When we were talking about this project,
you too thought it would be mine, right?

1011
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:23,672
l didn't even expect
- Don't be sorry. You thought so too, right?

1012
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:24,713
Yes, sir.

1013
01:15:25,852 --> 01:15:28,320
So it's not wrong that l thought the same?

1014
01:15:28,488 --> 01:15:31,651
No, why do you ask?
- Just to get clarity.

1015
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:35,386
We'll go to see the site?
- Okay, sir. Let's see. Come.

1016
01:15:39,466 --> 01:15:42,867
Dear, do you want cashew nuts
or pistachios in the pudding?

1017
01:15:43,036 --> 01:15:44,162
Do you've poison seed?

1018
01:15:44,338 --> 01:15:46,363
Why are you talking like that?

1019
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,974
What happened?
Did they fire you from job?

1020
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:49,836
You keep this.

1021
01:15:50,944 --> 01:15:53,139
Can l bear if anything happens to you?
- Can l keep it with me, sir?

1022
01:15:53,914 --> 01:15:54,676
Talk to me, dear.

1023
01:15:56,316 --> 01:15:57,806
He said keep it and then pulled it away.

1024
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:06,315
Did dad tell you about the project?

1025
01:16:06,493 --> 01:16:08,154
So this is a family planning?

1026
01:16:08,328 --> 01:16:09,090
He told me.

1027
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:10,652
This happened because of you.

1028
01:16:11,765 --> 01:16:13,027
Where are you off to?

1029
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,567
To see the site once
before filing the budget.

1030
01:16:16,737 --> 01:16:18,329
To the site?
Then l'm coming, too.

1031
01:16:18,505 --> 01:16:20,939
To see the site or ogle?

1032
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,806
You always let your scarf trail.

1033
01:16:27,981 --> 01:16:29,414
What an act!

1034
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,448
Why don't you sit here?
- No, l'll come from that side.

1035
01:16:31,618 --> 01:16:33,677
She's asking, right?
Why don't you sit on her lap?

1036
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:38,847
What a vast site!

1037
01:16:39,526 --> 01:16:41,187
How will l do it myself? l'm nervous.

1038
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:44,057
Dad's choice is always perfect.

1039
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:45,255
l'm telling you.

1040
01:16:45,932 --> 01:16:47,524
No way, my foot!

1041
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:51,433
My mom was like this, too.
She'd always encourage me like you.

1042
01:16:51,605 --> 01:16:53,766
Look at him getting mileage
with mother sentiment!

1043
01:16:57,377 --> 01:16:58,241
What are you looking at?

1044
01:16:59,012 --> 01:17:01,003
They're all the biggest builders of our state.

1045
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:02,871
There's heavy competition
to get this tender.

1046
01:17:03,049 --> 01:17:03,845
Why, sir?

1047
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:07,953
lt's the government's project.
Easy to swindle a 100 or 200 crores.

1048
01:17:08,121 --> 01:17:10,783
How will we get it with so much competition?

1049
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:12,822
We won't get it. Let's go.

1050
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:19,063
You just give a fair and honest budget.
The rest lies with God.

1051
01:17:20,634 --> 01:17:24,832
This tender is definitely ours.
No one else will ever take such a tender.

1052
01:17:24,971 --> 01:17:27,405
They should purchase cement
and bricks from us only.

1053
01:17:27,574 --> 01:17:29,599
Government projects are always ours!

1054
01:17:29,876 --> 01:17:33,573
Dad knows all this.
You'll know this as time passes.

1055
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:36,741
We've given the tender to someone else.
Go outside the office and discuss.

1056
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:48,324
You made very tall claims
How did the tender get away?

1057
01:17:49,196 --> 01:17:50,686
l too can't get this one.

1058
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:53,025
l've my man in office,
l'll get information from him.

1059
01:17:55,435 --> 01:17:57,300
How come the tender went
to another company?

1060
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:01,464
l tried so hard, sir.
But new officer is too straightforward.

1061
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:04,542
He's next to me, l'll call later.

1062
01:18:06,546 --> 01:18:08,946
He's babbling some nonsense.
We'll take this matter to father.

1063
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:10,446
He'll set it right.

1064
01:18:10,617 --> 01:18:12,312
This is my first project.

1065
01:18:12,486 --> 01:18:17,355
lf l go to him for help,
how will he trust me with the company?

1066
01:18:17,557 --> 01:18:18,649
We need to handle this.

1067
01:18:18,825 --> 01:18:20,816
How can we? The tender has gone to
another company.

1068
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:25,488
What happens if the project is not handled
properly and government's money is wasted?

1069
01:18:25,665 --> 01:18:29,795
The tender is revoked and the next
favourable company gets the tender.

1070
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,133
l'll make sure that the tender is lost.

1071
01:18:33,306 --> 01:18:36,469
You make sure that we get the tender then.

1072
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,647
He's the one.
- Everyone got shocked seeing our budget.

1073
01:18:41,815 --> 01:18:43,646
Even l thought if we can do this
project in that cost.

1074
01:18:43,817 --> 01:18:46,581
We gave cost to cost budget,
what's the problem?

1075
01:18:47,621 --> 01:18:50,317
Sir, you're Krishnamohan Varma's
son Ashok Varma, right?

1076
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:53,220
l came to your company for
an interview, remember?

1077
01:18:57,764 --> 01:19:02,224
l find him so annoying.
- Why? You know him?

1078
01:19:02,602 --> 01:19:07,335
No. But l've disliked these
low class people since childhood.

1079
01:19:36,636 --> 01:19:39,628
You're a talented guy!
Why aren't you getting a job, though?

1080
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:43,441
Talent won't do these days.

1081
01:19:43,643 --> 01:19:46,635
What else they want?
Talent is more than enough, Raghu.

1082
01:19:46,813 --> 01:19:47,802
Leave it, mother.

1083
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:15,264
Go...go away loneliness...
loneliness...

1084
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:24,104
My queen is mine...
She reached me like a dream...

1085
01:21:24,644 --> 01:21:30,412
l've turned a new leaf like
mesmerizing smile...

1086
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:44,589
Beauty...she's mine...

1087
01:22:26,372 --> 01:22:32,902
Like a flower garden,
come to me like a dream...

1088
01:22:34,914 --> 01:22:39,715
My time is crumpled without
a life partner...

1089
01:22:39,886 --> 01:22:44,550
My heart turned bright
when your shadow touched me...

1090
01:22:44,724 --> 01:22:49,593
Sighs of despair is past to me...

1091
01:22:49,796 --> 01:22:54,563
The wind of your fragrance
consoled me...

1092
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:59,569
O little droplet, wet my heart...

1093
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:04,574
l'm wet and enjoying it unlimitedly...

1094
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:09,613
The wind that blew from you
touched me...

1095
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:14,378
Like mother, it sang a beautiful lullaby...

1096
01:24:20,353 --> 01:24:22,412
Sir, government has provided
600 square foot per home.

1097
01:24:22,589 --> 01:24:24,682
We need to provide everything
within that space.

1098
01:24:26,192 --> 01:24:27,420
The files you'd asked for.

1099
01:24:29,696 --> 01:24:31,186
l think its Swarnapushpam.

1100
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:36,262
You forgot to wish her on her birthday.

1101
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:42,002
Hubby, you left without even
wishing me on my birthday!

1102
01:24:42,175 --> 01:24:43,107
l feel like crying, hubby.

1103
01:24:43,276 --> 01:24:46,268
l'll come evening and make you laugh.
- l love you, hubby.

1104
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,572
How do you know my wife's birthday?

1105
01:24:48,715 --> 01:24:50,546
Swarnapushpam and l are
Facebook friends, sir.

1106
01:24:50,717 --> 01:24:52,708
Facebook friends?
- Yes, sir.

1107
01:24:57,457 --> 01:24:58,116
Yes, sir.

1108
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:00,191
Why did you say yes?

1109
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,726
You asked if we were Facebook friends.
- For that?

1110
01:25:02,962 --> 01:25:04,589
l asked just for clarity.

1111
01:25:12,972 --> 01:25:13,700
Brother, move aside.

1112
01:25:13,873 --> 01:25:14,771
Madam, put that down.

1113
01:25:17,277 --> 01:25:18,869
Bring the chopper.

1114
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:29,252
They've sent cheap quality bricks!

1115
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:31,583
Sir, that's how it will be.
- What?

1116
01:25:31,758 --> 01:25:34,591
Materials are always of poor quality
in government projects, sir.

1117
01:25:34,761 --> 01:25:38,959
l have paid you for good materials.
Not poor quality ones.

1118
01:25:39,132 --> 01:25:41,498
Sir, this is MLA Varalaraju's
company materials.

1119
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:44,728
We always get bricks and mortar
from him for any government project.

1120
01:25:44,904 --> 01:25:47,464
This is an unwritten understanding.
You're new here...so..

1121
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,164
This is not new or experienced!

1122
01:25:49,342 --> 01:25:51,242
l don't care where the materials
are coming from.

1123
01:25:51,411 --> 01:25:52,673
l need good material, that's all.

1124
01:25:52,812 --> 01:25:55,576
Since it is Govt. project nobody
would question your work, right?

1125
01:25:55,748 --> 01:25:57,943
Return the material and
order material from quality suppliers.

1126
01:25:58,117 --> 01:25:59,049
What about work?

1127
01:25:59,218 --> 01:26:01,743
Stop everything.
Wait till the new load comes.

1128
01:26:02,021 --> 01:26:03,511
Do what l say!

1129
01:26:04,524 --> 01:26:06,389
Playing with so people's lives!

1130
01:26:06,559 --> 01:26:08,823
Let any number of buildings collapse,
people like you never change.

1131
01:26:09,095 --> 01:26:11,154
l need to go to the slum clearance
board to collect the next cheque.

1132
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:12,628
Handle things here.

1133
01:26:15,835 --> 01:26:18,929
l heard you rejected our materials?

1134
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:22,833
lt's not like that.
The quality of the materials was poor.

1135
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:24,634
1 25 lf so change the materials.

1136
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:26,711
Why are you insisting on buying
materials from elsewhere?

1137
01:26:26,846 --> 01:26:30,612
No, sir. l was told all your
materials will be this quality only.

1138
01:26:31,217 --> 01:26:33,947
That's how it will be.
That's how it always has been.

1139
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,985
Which is why we take the tender
and finish it on our own.

1140
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:38,123
Why did you poke your nose
in our business?

1141
01:26:38,725 --> 01:26:40,556
Sir, let's talk decently.

1142
01:26:40,727 --> 01:26:44,720
lf we use cheap materials the building
will collapse even for a small earthquake.

1143
01:26:44,864 --> 01:26:46,627
Thousands of lives!
- Let them die!

1144
01:26:46,799 --> 01:26:49,859
Earlier the population was 30 crores,
then it swell to 60 crores.

1145
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:51,627
No one knows
how many are there now.

1146
01:26:51,804 --> 01:26:53,135
This is the only way we can keep
that in check.

1147
01:26:53,306 --> 01:26:54,671
l can't allow such mistakes
to happen, sir.

1148
01:26:54,841 --> 01:26:56,968
l'll hack you right now here!

1149
01:26:57,143 --> 01:27:00,374
Skinny fool!
l'm being very nice to you.

1150
01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:02,741
Give me the tender and get out of here.

1151
01:27:03,149 --> 01:27:07,210
You took me for a geek because
of the glasses and the combed hair?

1152
01:27:07,387 --> 01:27:11,551
Actually, l'm very bad boy, sir.
l use cuss words very easily.

1153
01:27:11,724 --> 01:27:15,490
You're being rude,
so l might lose my cool.

1154
01:27:15,762 --> 01:27:18,060
Even if you send the right materials,
l don't want.

1155
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:19,858
l will get it from outside.

1156
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:21,166
Bye.

1157
01:27:24,103 --> 01:27:26,367
Return the material and
ask them for a refund.

1158
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:29,007
Go to a good company and
ask for good quality materials.

1159
01:27:29,175 --> 01:27:29,732
Okay.

1160
01:27:30,877 --> 01:27:31,673
Hello, tell me.

1161
01:27:31,844 --> 01:27:34,278
Raghuvaran returned my material.

1162
01:27:34,447 --> 01:27:35,277
What are you saying?

1163
01:27:35,448 --> 01:27:38,611
You promised to make him
give up project.

1164
01:27:38,785 --> 01:27:40,082
l know what to do, hang up!

1165
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:41,286
This is the plan.

1166
01:27:42,422 --> 01:27:44,549
The building is going to come there.

1167
01:27:44,924 --> 01:27:46,915
You are going to live in concrete houses.

1168
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:07,908
Who is this new bird?

1169
01:28:11,884 --> 01:28:12,816
The old bird!

1170
01:28:15,988 --> 01:28:17,216
Two girls?!

1171
01:28:30,403 --> 01:28:32,166
lt's wrong to do all this before marriage.

1172
01:28:39,178 --> 01:28:40,008
ls this is a house?

1173
01:28:40,913 --> 01:28:42,972
This is your house?
- Yes, for now.

1174
01:28:43,182 --> 01:28:45,241
You're living in a giant carry bag!

1175
01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:46,476
Who lives in the ground floor?

1176
01:28:46,652 --> 01:28:49,815
Don't mock me!
This is the first house l built.

1177
01:28:49,956 --> 01:28:51,150
Here comes the new bird

1178
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,357
l made this for you.

1179
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,320
ls this what you call door delivery?

1180
01:28:57,497 --> 01:29:00,261
No door at all here.
- Go, he's here, come later.

1181
01:29:00,433 --> 01:29:01,991
Why this sudden silence?

1182
01:29:02,201 --> 01:29:04,829
Don't you have anything to do?
You're always with him.

1183
01:29:08,241 --> 01:29:11,699
Did she scold me?
- No, sir! lt was Harry Potter.

1184
01:29:15,648 --> 01:29:17,138
Please come in.
- Old bird!

1185
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:19,477
Getting 1 plus 1 festival offer!

1186
01:29:19,752 --> 01:29:21,379
Sir, can you please get up?

1187
01:29:22,655 --> 01:29:23,849
l'll wait in the next room.
- Okay.

1188
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,615
Please, sit!

1189
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:26,018
Are you surprized?

1190
01:29:26,726 --> 01:29:28,387
Nothing to eat...

1191
01:29:30,563 --> 01:29:31,257
Have cutlet!

1192
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,557
Homemade.
- Whose home?

1193
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:35,291
Whom are you offering?

1194
01:29:39,038 --> 01:29:39,800
Bye.

1195
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:43,465
Sir, come in.

1196
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:46,609
ls anyone else going to visit?
- No more visitors, please come.

1197
01:29:46,779 --> 01:29:47,746
Can l sit?

1198
01:29:48,748 --> 01:29:52,844
So, the girl who brought you cutlet...

1199
01:29:53,019 --> 01:29:54,577
Yes, Shalini!
My neighbour.

1200
01:29:54,754 --> 01:29:55,345
Yes, sir.

1201
01:29:55,588 --> 01:29:58,022
And the girl who ate cutlet?
- That's our Anitha madam!

1202
01:29:58,191 --> 01:30:00,022
l know that!

1203
01:30:00,193 --> 01:30:02,320
Don't mistake me for asking this, right?
- Ask me, sir.

1204
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:06,659
ls it that girl who is that
or this girl who's that.

1205
01:30:06,832 --> 01:30:08,026
Or both of them those?

1206
01:30:08,201 --> 01:30:11,568
Sir, what's this, sir?
- Why?

1207
01:30:11,737 --> 01:30:15,070
l feel my mother lives in her, sir.

1208
01:30:15,274 --> 01:30:17,174
Don't link me with her, sir.

1209
01:30:17,343 --> 01:30:20,437
Forgive me.
- No problem, sir.

1210
01:30:20,613 --> 01:30:23,343
l reacted like the general audience.
- That's okay, sir.

1211
01:30:37,096 --> 01:30:40,554
Please stop the car.
- What happened, Raghuvaran?

1212
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:43,463
Sir, this is all wrong, sir.
- What is wrong?

1213
01:30:43,636 --> 01:30:45,866
These columns should not be here.

1214
01:30:46,038 --> 01:30:48,302
Check the plan, sir.
- Let's see!

1215
01:30:49,475 --> 01:30:50,271
Yes.

1216
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:52,238
This is not my plan at all, sir.

1217
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:55,403
This is not in my plan,
my plan is different, look here!

1218
01:30:55,581 --> 01:30:56,878
They're constructing wrongly.

1219
01:30:57,049 --> 01:30:57,879
Somewhere they're making a mistake, sir.

1220
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:59,608
lt's Govt. project!
Lot of money, sir.

1221
01:30:59,785 --> 01:31:01,776
What will l tell my MD?
- Just a minute.

1222
01:31:01,954 --> 01:31:04,047
Who is in charge of this?
Jagan! Let's ask him, come.

1223
01:31:04,223 --> 01:31:06,418
What was the plan l gave and
what are you executing, Jagan?

1224
01:31:06,592 --> 01:31:09,060
Sir, l've executed the plan you gave me.

1225
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:12,891
This is the plan l gave!
Are you following this plan?

1226
01:31:13,065 --> 01:31:15,397
This is not the plan you gave me.

1227
01:31:15,568 --> 01:31:17,900
Bring that plan here.
- Sir, he is...

1228
01:31:20,506 --> 01:31:21,837
This is the plan you gave me.

1229
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:28,072
This is not even my plan.
This is not what l gave you.

1230
01:31:28,247 --> 01:31:30,078
Are you acting smart with me?
- Who is acting?

1231
01:31:30,249 --> 01:31:34,549
He'll make a plan of his own,
if he knows it is wrong,

1232
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,244
he'll get another plan!

1233
01:31:36,422 --> 01:31:39,084
That's why only experienced people
should handle the projects.

1234
01:31:39,258 --> 01:31:43,251
This is what happens when greenhorns
are given such huge projects.

1235
01:31:43,429 --> 01:31:45,920
Talk respectfully Jagan,
if not l've to complain to Chairman.

1236
01:31:46,098 --> 01:31:47,588
l'm not afraid of Chairman.

1237
01:31:47,767 --> 01:31:49,496
lf he doesn't know his job,
that's what l will say.

1238
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:52,502
What did l ever do to you?
So much money has gone waste.

1239
01:31:52,672 --> 01:31:53,570
What will l tell him now?

1240
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,435
You wasted the money,
are you blaming me for it?

1241
01:31:56,609 --> 01:31:57,906
Go, learn job properly.

1242
01:32:01,647 --> 01:32:02,807
Now l can understand.

1243
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:04,711
l'm sure this is act of wanton negligence.

1244
01:32:04,884 --> 01:32:06,283
lt's not your fault.

1245
01:32:06,452 --> 01:32:08,647
There are ten divisions,
how can you look all of them?

1246
01:32:08,821 --> 01:32:10,186
Someone is behind all this.

1247
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,627
lt seems lots of mistakes are
happening in the project.

1248
01:32:23,803 --> 01:32:25,293
lt has become the talking point.

1249
01:32:25,471 --> 01:32:30,067
lf someone undeserving bites more
than he can chew, this is what happens.

1250
01:32:31,177 --> 01:32:34,772
First, you need to build
sand castles on beach.

1251
01:32:34,947 --> 01:32:38,781
Then you buy building blocks from
a toy store and build.

1252
01:32:38,951 --> 01:32:42,352
1Then take up small tenders
like building school toilet...

1253
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:47,652
At once if you go for 300 crore project,
would we watch it quietly?

1254
01:32:47,827 --> 01:32:49,385
What are you going to do now?

1255
01:32:49,562 --> 01:32:55,091
Demolish this whole thing, clear everything
and start from foundation again.

1256
01:32:55,234 --> 01:32:58,203
lmagining it makes me dizzy!
Think you can deliver on time?

1257
01:32:58,371 --> 01:33:02,501
And you said you'd only use
high quality cement, bricks and iron rods.

1258
01:33:02,675 --> 01:33:04,666
There'll be 30 crore loss
at least, right, Jagan?

1259
01:33:04,844 --> 01:33:05,367
Yes, sir.

1260
01:33:05,544 --> 01:33:07,876
lf you have lose 30 crores in
a 1 70 crore project...

1261
01:33:08,047 --> 01:33:10,208
Can you complete the
project in 1 40 crores?

1262
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:12,145
What do you say, Jagan?
- Very difficult, sir.

1263
01:33:12,284 --> 01:33:16,516
Don't l know that this project's budget
is 200 crores?

1264
01:33:16,856 --> 01:33:19,017
lsn't that why we gave a 300 crore budget!

1265
01:33:20,192 --> 01:33:22,251
Here comes the smart ass!

1266
01:33:22,995 --> 01:33:26,294
We've been living this trade
for generations now.

1267
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:30,191
Think we'll let beggars like you
into the game so easily?

1268
01:33:30,536 --> 01:33:32,470
Do the job you're capable of.

1269
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:36,136
Declare this project is beyond
your capacity and run away.

1270
01:33:36,275 --> 01:33:38,436
l'll give you five, or maybe even ten.

1271
01:33:38,844 --> 01:33:40,436
Otherwise...
- What the hell can you do?

1272
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:44,742
You foolish brat!

1273
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:48,148
With absolutely no talent or
academic qualification.

1274
01:33:48,287 --> 01:33:51,848
You've jumped straight to the boss's chair
because your father was rich...

1275
01:33:52,024 --> 01:33:53,423
Without shedding a drop of sweat
sat on MD's chair!

1276
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:55,219
lf you can be so arrogant.

1277
01:33:55,394 --> 01:33:57,225
My parents struggled to pay donation
and put me in school.

1278
01:33:57,396 --> 01:33:59,489
l studied so hard from kindergarten
to tenth class,

1279
01:33:59,665 --> 01:34:03,101
leaving easy groups in lnter,
taking MPC group,

1280
01:34:03,269 --> 01:34:05,567
because only then
l can become an engineer,

1281
01:34:05,738 --> 01:34:09,105
l took a different tuition for physics,
maths and chemistry.

1282
01:34:09,275 --> 01:34:10,867
l was juggling from one class to another.

1283
01:34:11,043 --> 01:34:12,408
tortured parents to pay my fees
through their noses,

1284
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:14,842
to pass the board exam, spent all night
studying with tea flask in tow,

1285
01:34:15,014 --> 01:34:18,074
waking up again morning
with alarm ring to study again,

1286
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:20,275
even after all this when failed
to get rank in entrance exam,

1287
01:34:20,486 --> 01:34:21,418
went for a long term course,

1288
01:34:21,587 --> 01:34:22,849
even then failed to get rank,

1289
01:34:23,022 --> 01:34:24,148
mortgaging mother's jewels,

1290
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:25,882
buying a seat in management quota,

1291
01:34:26,058 --> 01:34:28,322
unable to catch with English medium,
since l studied in Telugu medium,

1292
01:34:28,527 --> 01:34:32,463
with so many arrears of four years,
l had to clear everything in the fourth year,

1293
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:33,655
when l entered the society,

1294
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:37,769
when people abused me saying
l'm an unemployed good for nothing guy,

1295
01:34:37,937 --> 01:34:42,203
without bothering about that,
knocked door of every office for job,

1296
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:45,833
and my father was scolding me
as useless free loader,

1297
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:48,775
every grain of rice was like
a thorn in my throat,

1298
01:34:48,948 --> 01:34:49,937
unable to swallow or throw up,

1299
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:51,275
l was going through hell,

1300
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:54,146
a great man came and offered me
an opportunity,

1301
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,947
that too a useless bugger like you
is trying to usurp it,

1302
01:34:56,121 --> 01:34:57,850
going against a bastard like you,

1303
01:34:58,023 --> 01:35:01,618
today l'm talking to you,
an unemployed graduate!

1304
01:35:01,794 --> 01:35:03,386
How arrogant should l be!

1305
01:35:04,497 --> 01:35:08,831
l'll ensure you don't finish this project,

1306
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:11,026
l'll make you waste entire money,

1307
01:35:11,203 --> 01:35:16,300
if l don't make poor people to hit you
with slipper and take you to police,

1308
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:18,202
Hey baby face!

1309
01:35:18,544 --> 01:35:21,240
You've only seen Raghuvaran
as a villain till now.

1310
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:23,312
Never seem him as hero, right?

1311
01:35:29,722 --> 01:35:31,087
You'll see him from now.

1312
01:35:41,901 --> 01:35:46,235
Fiery unemployed graduate...

1313
01:35:47,373 --> 01:35:51,776
lf he decides he can unite earth and sky...

1314
01:35:52,611 --> 01:36:03,283
Hoist the flag of victory
winning the battle...

1315
01:36:03,422 --> 01:36:06,357
Time changes to make you a hero
to write new history...

1316
01:36:06,525 --> 01:36:08,720
Show your courage...

1317
01:36:08,961 --> 01:36:11,691
Toil shedding blood as sweat
to catch the moon...

1318
01:36:11,897 --> 01:36:14,695
You must fight to victory...

1319
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:20,401
What happened in the meeting?

1320
01:36:20,573 --> 01:36:22,541
They told us to continue the project, sir.

1321
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:27,441
lf we can't finish the project in budget,
overruns should be borne by company.

1322
01:36:27,746 --> 01:36:29,304
You don't worry, sir.

1323
01:36:29,448 --> 01:36:31,416
l'll somehow finish within the budget, sir.

1324
01:36:31,617 --> 01:36:36,054
lt wasn't your mistake, Raghuvaran.
Luckily we could notice in the beginning.

1325
01:36:36,221 --> 01:36:38,883
Don't worry about making
30 or 40 crore losses.

1326
01:36:39,058 --> 01:36:40,855
Think about way and means to cover it.

1327
01:36:41,026 --> 01:36:42,926
l've full confidence in you.

1328
01:36:44,863 --> 01:36:46,194
l'll keep your trust, sir.

1329
01:36:46,365 --> 01:36:47,457
Tell me.
- Greetings, sir.

1330
01:36:47,933 --> 01:36:51,391
l'm working on a project to shift the poor
from their hutments to concrete houses.

1331
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:55,472
We want to do this fairly,
without taking any cuts or bribes.

1332
01:36:55,674 --> 01:36:56,402
Okay.

1333
01:36:56,575 --> 01:36:58,975
But there are people preventing us
from doing that.

1334
01:36:59,144 --> 01:37:01,635
You mean Ashok Varma?
l heard about him.

1335
01:37:01,814 --> 01:37:05,409
Even his dad has same mindset,
wouldn't let us get a single govt. project.

1336
01:37:05,584 --> 01:37:07,313
And his son seems to be worse!

1337
01:37:07,453 --> 01:37:10,251
l heard you're doing a fair job.
What can l do for you?

1338
01:37:10,422 --> 01:37:13,914
lf you could give us a additional discount
from the rates you normally quote.

1339
01:37:14,093 --> 01:37:14,923
lt would really help us.

1340
01:37:15,094 --> 01:37:18,029
This is for a good cause.
And you seem like good people.

1341
01:37:18,197 --> 01:37:19,596
l'll give 15%/0 discount.

1342
01:37:19,765 --> 01:37:21,926
This is for the poor.
Be little more generous.

1343
01:37:22,101 --> 01:37:22,931
What do you have in mind?

1344
01:37:23,102 --> 01:37:28,267
lf you give 75%/0 discount we'll use
the leftover cement to erect your statue.

1345
01:37:29,775 --> 01:37:32,437
Forget 15 or 75...
- Won't you give anything?

1346
01:37:32,778 --> 01:37:36,714
lf you ask beyond this,
l'll have to give it for free.

1347
01:37:36,882 --> 01:37:38,975
l will take that, too, sir.
- Keep quiet, sir.

1348
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:41,483
He may change his mind.
- Keep doing business with us, Raghu.

1349
01:37:41,687 --> 01:37:43,678
But don't expect a discount the next time.

1350
01:37:43,856 --> 01:37:44,788
Sure, sir.

1351
01:37:44,957 --> 01:37:47,517
VlP, toil and the diamond is ours...

1352
01:37:47,726 --> 01:37:50,160
VlP, young lndia is all ours...

1353
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:52,661
VlP, the new history belongs to us...

1354
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:55,959
VlP, you've the guts to win...

1355
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:09,843
Tell 10 people from each division
to work here.

1356
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:12,313
Tell them to work extra 2 hours.

1357
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:14,475
We must complete the project on time.

1358
01:38:29,068 --> 01:38:32,663
Looks like you're unable to meet
the challenges you made.

1359
01:38:32,838 --> 01:38:36,239
He seems to have struck some deals.
And the work seems to be going great!

1360
01:38:36,408 --> 01:38:39,172
We'll take this to your father?

1361
01:38:39,344 --> 01:38:42,677
Look, this is my prestige issue now.

1362
01:38:42,848 --> 01:38:44,179
l need to beat him on my own now.

1363
01:38:44,349 --> 01:38:48,012
Beat him? What, you're going to
send goons to beat him up?

1364
01:38:48,554 --> 01:38:50,078
Do l look like a sissy?

1365
01:38:50,255 --> 01:38:53,588
You'll have to send men to do that.
What else will you do?

1366
01:38:54,026 --> 01:38:56,085
We'll be okay as long as we don't send men.

1367
01:38:56,261 --> 01:38:57,558
l don't get you.

1368
01:39:03,902 --> 01:39:07,531
Why are you taking me walking now?

1369
01:39:07,706 --> 01:39:10,197
We're riding on my bike!
- ls this a bike?

1370
01:39:10,375 --> 01:39:12,206
l meant, is this your bike?
- Yes, sir.

1371
01:39:12,377 --> 01:39:14,709
This is apt for your size.
Who bought it for you?

1372
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,348
My dad bought it for me
when l got first rank in class seven.

1373
01:39:20,385 --> 01:39:22,148
Just for a clarification.
- Ask me, sir.

1374
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:24,983
Does this bike have an engine
or you pedal it the way?

1375
01:39:25,157 --> 01:39:26,988
Sir, don't mock my bike!
lt's very special to me.

1376
01:39:27,159 --> 01:39:30,185
Yes, you're the only one in entire lndia
who owns this bike.

1377
01:39:30,362 --> 01:39:30,987
Yes, sir

1378
01:39:31,563 --> 01:39:34,123
Don't give it away, ever!
- No way, sir!

1379
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:45,175
Why haven't workers come yet, sir?
- l too don't get it!

1380
01:39:46,745 --> 01:39:48,804
Must be some payment problem.
Just check in the labourers camp.

1381
01:39:48,981 --> 01:39:51,245
We've been paying promptly.
l'll check.

1382
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:55,081
You all know how many projects
l'm doing in this state.

1383
01:39:55,254 --> 01:39:57,313
That boy is a greenhorn.

1384
01:39:57,489 --> 01:39:58,581
He's here now.

1385
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:01,659
But no one knows
if he'll be around in the future.

1386
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,827
So you guys decide.

1387
01:40:02,995 --> 01:40:06,863
lf you work there, you will not get
work in my, my friends',

1388
01:40:07,032 --> 01:40:09,626
or company shareholders' projects.

1389
01:40:09,802 --> 01:40:11,770
There's no one in the labourer's camp!

1390
01:40:11,937 --> 01:40:13,598
There's no one?
- Yes.

1391
01:40:16,074 --> 01:40:17,541
Sir, call that supervisor and find out.

1392
01:40:17,676 --> 01:40:22,636
lf you don't go there, l will pay
you twice the salary you're making.

1393
01:40:22,815 --> 01:40:26,182
l will guarantee that you will work
in all of my projects.

1394
01:40:26,351 --> 01:40:30,344
He's not answering my calls.
l'll meet him in person and find out.

1395
01:40:30,522 --> 01:40:33,548
How irresponsible!
He should've informed us if there's problem...

1396
01:40:34,693 --> 01:40:37,526
Hey, boy! Standing alone?

1397
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:39,623
There's no one with you, right?

1398
01:40:39,798 --> 01:40:45,828
lf you work alone for 20 hours a day...
10 divisions 30 days,

1399
01:40:46,004 --> 01:40:49,371
You'll take 22 years to
complete the project.

1400
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:52,874
But don't just quit this project!

1401
01:40:53,045 --> 01:40:57,072
l will beat you, destroy you and
take it away from you.

1402
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,645
This project is not such
a big deal to me.

1403
01:41:00,986 --> 01:41:04,251
But a local like you challenging me!

1404
01:41:04,456 --> 01:41:09,325
And now that you've become a hero,
l need to be the villain, right?

1405
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:29,747
Sir, why do you worry
when you have us?

1406
01:41:29,948 --> 01:41:37,377
All the plumbing, painting, carpentry, cleaning
and every other job is done around by us!

1407
01:41:37,556 --> 01:41:39,615
We're toiling for strangers.

1408
01:41:39,758 --> 01:41:43,216
You're building homes for us.
Won't we work for our own homes?

1409
01:41:49,768 --> 01:41:52,601
We can manage 4 divisions with them.
What about the rest?

1410
01:41:53,138 --> 01:41:54,605
We need more labourers.

1411
01:41:55,173 --> 01:41:57,573
We need electronic and
mechanical engineers too!

1412
01:41:57,743 --> 01:42:00,337
We need supervisors to guide them.

1413
01:42:00,512 --> 01:42:04,312
We need to meet someone and
get this sorted within two days!

1414
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:30,738
Hey, officer! ls this Facebook?
- Yes, sir.

1415
01:42:31,944 --> 01:42:34,105
Swarnapushpam and l are Facebook friends.

1416
01:42:35,347 --> 01:42:37,144
l need to investigate something here.
Give me!

1417
01:42:37,316 --> 01:42:41,810
Give me your account details.
- Account AZ12347680.

1418
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,612
What's that?
- That's my Grameena bank account.

1419
01:42:43,789 --> 01:42:46,349
l need your Facebook account.
You have to create one.

1420
01:42:46,525 --> 01:42:48,823
lf you post it here,
it'll reach the whole world.

1421
01:42:49,027 --> 01:42:51,689
lt is that powerful?
What about Twitter?

1422
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:54,128
First learn to use this.
We can do that later.

1423
01:42:54,299 --> 01:42:55,288
Give me your laptop.

1424
01:43:22,627 --> 01:43:23,821
What happens when you post this?

1425
01:43:24,029 --> 01:43:29,296
lf any press people or the opposition
party men see this video.

1426
01:43:29,468 --> 01:43:30,958
They might talk it over and support us.

1427
01:43:31,303 --> 01:43:34,636
lf at least 10,000 people view it,
we'll get some help.

1428
01:43:34,806 --> 01:43:38,037
Now how many viewed this?
- 120 views.

1429
01:43:39,644 --> 01:43:44,638
lf we say Ashok threatened them not to
work for us, people may not believe us.

1430
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:47,140
And we might lose the project.

1431
01:43:47,319 --> 01:43:49,651
Nothing of that sort will happen...
you be brave.

1432
01:43:49,888 --> 01:43:51,219
l've given all the instructions to Krishna.

1433
01:43:51,390 --> 01:43:55,326
Ask him whatever you want.
Okay? Go.- Okay, sir.

1434
01:43:56,328 --> 01:43:59,354
Raghuvaran, the slum clearance
department called many times.

1435
01:43:59,531 --> 01:44:01,829
For how long can l avoid?
Pressure is building up.

1436
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,333
lf this continues,
we will lose the project.

1437
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:25,879
l'm also a member of the
VlP community.

1438
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:28,025
l saw your post on Facebook.

1439
01:44:28,193 --> 01:44:31,560
So l just came to help
in any way l can.

1440
01:44:32,764 --> 01:44:34,163
What can we do with one man...

1441
01:44:34,332 --> 01:44:37,768
lt was just the two of us yesterday.
Today, we're three.

1442
01:44:40,505 --> 01:44:41,767
Come, l'll show you the plans.

1443
01:44:48,647 --> 01:44:51,207
You said only one guy!
Look how many are coming.

1444
01:44:51,483 --> 01:44:54,782
Oh my God! Are there so many
unemployed engineers?

1445
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,514
lf so many turned up from
a Facebook group,

1446
01:44:57,689 --> 01:45:00,249
how many engineers will be
unemployed all over lndia?

1447
01:45:05,931 --> 01:45:11,892
Strength is our strength...
lt's a deluge...let's show it...

1448
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:16,803
Yes, we can do it...
Let's the bull's eye to show it...

1449
01:45:27,285 --> 01:45:32,188
Trickling into become a mighty army...

1450
01:45:32,357 --> 01:45:34,917
Let's fill the dark night with light...

1451
01:45:35,093 --> 01:45:37,687
With courage and great deeds...
Let's showcase the power of youth...

1452
01:45:37,863 --> 01:45:40,855
We can do four more projects
like this with them.

1453
01:45:40,999 --> 01:45:42,261
Our community, sir!

1454
01:45:42,434 --> 01:45:47,997
Fight your way to bring the moon to earth....

1455
01:46:38,323 --> 01:46:40,723
Hey, baby face!
- Call me baby face...

1456
01:46:40,892 --> 01:46:44,157
lt's pissing you off? Baby face!

1457
01:46:44,329 --> 01:46:47,196
Baby face, first you need to
play tree climbing games.

1458
01:46:47,365 --> 01:46:49,162
And then play Gilly.

1459
01:46:49,334 --> 01:46:53,202
Then play girls' games like
kho-kho and throw ball.

1460
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:58,001
But if you play WWF directly,
your face will get smashed.

1461
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:01,668
On top of this, you said you're
the villain on phone!

1462
01:47:01,846 --> 01:47:03,404
l couldn't stop laughing out loud.

1463
01:47:03,582 --> 01:47:07,416
To tell you the truth,
l don't feel you're a villain.

1464
01:47:07,586 --> 01:47:09,451
You're baby face, right?

1465
01:47:09,621 --> 01:47:14,058
You paid my labourers
to stop them working for me.

1466
01:47:14,259 --> 01:47:16,784
There are things that money can't buy.

1467
01:47:16,962 --> 01:47:19,760
Like the bonding between students,
friendship, love

1468
01:47:19,931 --> 01:47:20,863
How would you know this!

1469
01:47:21,032 --> 01:47:23,398
You were born and brought up
in AC rooms.

1470
01:47:23,568 --> 01:47:25,536
Do you know who you're talking to?

1471
01:47:25,704 --> 01:47:28,537
Do you know who l am?
Do you know who my father is?

1472
01:47:28,707 --> 01:47:30,072
You don't know your father's name?

1473
01:47:30,242 --> 01:47:31,470
What kind of family is that!
- l don't know.

1474
01:47:31,643 --> 01:47:34,271
l don't like your face
l'm going to work.

1475
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,340
Why do you flaunt your daddy's
name to make a living?

1476
01:47:38,516 --> 01:47:40,040
Earn a name for yourself, won't you?

1477
01:47:40,218 --> 01:47:44,211
You beggar!
What would you know about status?

1478
01:47:44,623 --> 01:47:46,420
Baby face!

1479
01:47:46,591 --> 01:47:51,756
lf l remove your surname,
you don't have an identity.

1480
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:55,422
l may be a beggar.
But l have my own identity.

1481
01:47:56,234 --> 01:47:58,464
VlP, toil and the diamond is ours...

1482
01:47:58,637 --> 01:48:01,128
VlP, young lndia is all ours...

1483
01:48:01,339 --> 01:48:03,899
VlP, the new history belongs to us...

1484
01:48:04,075 --> 01:48:07,841
VlP, you've the guts to win...

1485
01:48:11,349 --> 01:48:15,911
Hey, send all the hooligans,
goons, henchmen there.

1486
01:48:16,087 --> 01:48:19,579
Break the limbs of every worker there!

1487
01:48:19,758 --> 01:48:22,659
lf necessary, kill them.
- No, let's take matter to father...

1488
01:48:22,827 --> 01:48:24,317
l said send the goons.

1489
01:48:24,596 --> 01:48:27,793
Will you send goons?
- Do l look like a sissy?

1490
01:48:32,037 --> 01:48:34,437
What are you thinking?

1491
01:48:34,873 --> 01:48:36,135
Do l look like a sissy?

1492
01:48:36,374 --> 01:48:37,272
Do l look like a sissy?

1493
01:48:37,442 --> 01:48:40,172
Did l say like that?
- Just do what l say!

1494
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:48,986
Tomorrow l'm going to China to buy material,
l'll home to check if wife packed my bag.

1495
01:48:49,154 --> 01:48:50,018
Call her.

1496
01:48:50,588 --> 01:48:53,648
l forgot my phone on table.
Please give me your phone.

1497
01:48:53,825 --> 01:48:54,849
l've to call my wife.
- Take it, sir.

1498
01:48:55,026 --> 01:48:58,052
You're lucky, your wife packs your bag.

1499
01:48:59,664 --> 01:49:00,358
What is this!

1500
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:04,632
l dial my wife, and it says GF?
- Really?

1501
01:49:04,803 --> 01:49:08,796
GF stands for girlfriend?
- Sir! Golden Flower, sir.

1502
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,207
'What's this golden flower?

1503
01:49:10,408 --> 01:49:12,376
Swarnapushpam, in English.

1504
01:49:13,945 --> 01:49:15,845
Why have you stored my wife's number?

1505
01:49:16,014 --> 01:49:17,413
Just in case of emergencies!

1506
01:49:17,582 --> 01:49:19,015
What emergency!

1507
01:49:19,184 --> 01:49:21,175
ln case of your emergencies, sir.

1508
01:49:21,353 --> 01:49:24,845
You can't store my wife's number
without my permission!

1509
01:49:25,023 --> 01:49:27,048
Why should l ask your permission
to save my sister's phone number?

1510
01:49:31,596 --> 01:49:34,463
He says Anita madam is like his mother.

1511
01:49:34,632 --> 01:49:38,227
And this idiot says my wife
Swarnapushpam is his own sister.

1512
01:49:38,436 --> 01:49:41,928
But they don't look like very good people!

1513
01:49:42,107 --> 01:49:44,371
Sir, you're actually speaking that out loud.

1514
01:49:50,682 --> 01:49:51,944
lt's okay. Come.

1515
01:49:57,856 --> 01:49:59,847
l thought he was looking
at the plan in his laptop.

1516
01:50:00,024 --> 01:50:02,618
But he's chatting with some chic!
Don't act like a good man.

1517
01:50:02,794 --> 01:50:04,887
There's some trouble, check

1518
01:50:05,964 --> 01:50:07,090
Go, check!

1519
01:50:07,399 --> 01:50:08,764
Who are you?
What's the problem?

1520
01:50:08,933 --> 01:50:09,865
Who are you man?

1521
01:50:13,204 --> 01:50:14,933
Who are they?
- Don't know who they are, sir!

1522
01:50:18,109 --> 01:50:19,633
They're hitting us unnecessarily.

1523
01:51:02,687 --> 01:51:06,054
You can't hit anyone as long as this
band is around your arm.

1524
01:51:39,524 --> 01:51:42,288
Sir, there's a huge riot here.
Few goons have attacked us, sir.

1525
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:43,859
l don't know who they are and
why they're hitting us.

1526
01:51:44,028 --> 01:51:45,086
Please come here soon.

1527
01:52:27,539 --> 01:52:30,770
Bleeding profusely....move...move...

1528
01:53:00,705 --> 01:53:04,038
l drew some cash from bank but
Anitha madam had already settled the bills.

1529
01:53:04,208 --> 01:53:05,368
Don't worry, uncle.

1530
01:53:05,843 --> 01:53:09,142
Nothing bad will happen.
- l know nothing is going to happen!

1531
01:53:09,414 --> 01:53:11,905
He's been beaten badly.
Bruises all over the body.

1532
01:53:12,817 --> 01:53:14,648
Even l have never hit him!

1533
01:53:15,153 --> 01:53:18,247
He never did anything correctly
from his childhood.

1534
01:53:18,423 --> 01:53:20,914
lf so many were attacking him,
shouldn't he cut the thread and hit back?

1535
01:53:21,092 --> 01:53:24,960
As if he's the only who has mother.
l can't stand his mother sentiment!

1536
01:53:25,163 --> 01:53:28,394
l've checked all the boys.
None of them are hurt too bad.

1537
01:53:28,566 --> 01:53:30,761
Just minor bruises and hairline fractures.

1538
01:53:30,935 --> 01:53:34,427
But Anand.. is in critical condition.

1539
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:35,833
He's in l.C.U.

1540
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:37,835
They say there's thin chance of survival.

1541
01:54:09,273 --> 01:54:11,002
What happened sir?

1542
01:54:12,043 --> 01:54:13,271
Why are you silent after such
a brutal attack?

1543
01:54:13,444 --> 01:54:14,843
Tell us, who is behind this attack?

1544
01:54:15,013 --> 01:54:18,039
Please say something.
- What should l say?

1545
01:54:18,216 --> 01:54:22,619
Everyone left their towns and families
to come and work for me.

1546
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:27,780
Those who are in power needn't help us,
but we were being beaten and bashed!

1547
01:54:28,259 --> 01:54:32,821
Engineers are doomed to get beaten up
by politicians, goons and corporates.

1548
01:54:33,331 --> 01:54:36,391
There are over 7000 engineering colleges
in our state, did you know that?

1549
01:54:36,868 --> 01:54:39,098
5,00,000 students pass out every year.

1550
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:42,637
Only 40,000 of them get jobs.
What about the others?

1551
01:54:43,941 --> 01:54:47,172
We find ourselves jobs and
there are people to sabotage that too.

1552
01:54:47,378 --> 01:54:48,970
First, it was the have-nots
who stole from the haves.

1553
01:54:49,147 --> 01:54:51,081
Now why are rich stealing from
those who don't have?

1554
01:54:51,983 --> 01:54:56,249
You're stealing the rights, the hard work,
opportunities and his whole life.

1555
01:54:56,854 --> 01:55:00,312
How many of you have finished engineering
and carrying a mike around now?

1556
01:55:01,759 --> 01:55:02,487
Hands down!

1557
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:06,221
Tell us who is responsible!
- Please don't ask me anything.

1558
01:55:06,397 --> 01:55:11,494
lf l say some name, they'll come
and hit others are fine now.

1559
01:55:11,669 --> 01:55:12,260
No need.

1560
01:55:12,437 --> 01:55:14,837
What should we report about
this brutal attack then?

1561
01:55:15,006 --> 01:55:19,500
We slipped and fell in bathrooms.
Report it like that.

1562
01:55:19,677 --> 01:55:20,507
Come on, boys.

1563
01:55:21,379 --> 01:55:22,505
Please say something, sir.

1564
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:26,275
Such a brutal attack,
why you not revealing the name, sir?

1565
01:55:26,584 --> 01:55:28,575
There are many ways to
worsen the situation.

1566
01:55:28,853 --> 01:55:30,411
But there's only one way to solve it.

1567
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:36,018
l struggled for 25 years
to make this company,

1568
01:55:36,194 --> 01:55:39,721
not to shut it down with your stupidity.
One after the other mistake.

1569
01:55:39,897 --> 01:55:44,129
Like kids playing with remote car,
you're playing with this company.

1570
01:55:44,302 --> 01:55:47,703
lt was my mistake to hand over
the company to you.

1571
01:55:48,873 --> 01:55:51,603
No dad, it's not a big issue as you think.

1572
01:55:51,809 --> 01:55:53,538
He would have realized our power now.

1573
01:55:53,711 --> 01:55:55,406
That's why he didn't reveal
our name to the press.

1574
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:58,105
He would have got scared.
He would have ran away.

1575
01:56:00,718 --> 01:56:02,709
Sir, one Raghuvaran is here
to meet you.

1576
01:56:18,336 --> 01:56:22,602
You must know everything.
Your son had my men attacked.

1577
01:56:23,174 --> 01:56:25,404
You're mistaken.
My son isn't like that.

1578
01:56:25,576 --> 01:56:27,737
l came here because l thought
you might be a gentleman.

1579
01:56:27,912 --> 01:56:30,312
Your son should come and
apologize to my men.

1580
01:56:30,481 --> 01:56:36,010
My son apologize to your men?
l said he didn't do anything.

1581
01:56:36,954 --> 01:56:39,286
Father and son are both sissies.

1582
01:56:39,457 --> 01:56:42,187
Who did you call a sissy?

1583
01:56:43,761 --> 01:56:47,925
Yes, l got those men to hit you.
What can you do about it?

1584
01:56:49,634 --> 01:56:55,197
Boy, when elders are talking,
you should be quiet.

1585
01:56:58,242 --> 01:57:01,439
lf my boys had wanted it,
they could have taken down you and your office.

1586
01:57:01,946 --> 01:57:03,641
They have been very patient till now.

1587
01:57:03,815 --> 01:57:05,942
You'll be responsible for
whatever happening hereafter.

1588
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:08,483
Though press wanted to know,
l didn't reveal your names.

1589
01:57:08,653 --> 01:57:11,213
l don't want to prolong this issue.
l want to end it.

1590
01:57:11,389 --> 01:57:12,981
Trying to scare me?

1591
01:57:14,125 --> 01:57:17,253
You're talking to a big business man.
Don't you forget that.

1592
01:57:17,428 --> 01:57:20,795
You quote 300 crores for
200 crore Govt. project,

1593
01:57:20,965 --> 01:57:23,627
and swindle 100 crores,
that's what you big business men do!

1594
01:57:23,801 --> 01:57:27,032
Swindle?
We use intelligence to make money.

1595
01:57:27,205 --> 01:57:28,467
You need talent for that.

1596
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:30,573
Even cheating has become talent now.

1597
01:57:30,708 --> 01:57:32,642
l don't need to answer you.

1598
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:35,142
Ask your son to apologize.
- He won't go.

1599
01:57:35,313 --> 01:57:37,008
l will take him by force.

1600
01:57:38,249 --> 01:57:39,978
Will you hit my son?

1601
01:57:40,284 --> 01:57:42,809
Try to hit him...hit him!

1602
01:57:47,258 --> 01:57:49,988
l told you l'll hit him and
you incited me to hit him!

1603
01:57:50,161 --> 01:57:51,253
How can l not him?

1604
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:56,163
Your son sent goons to hit us,
one of them is fighting for life,

1605
01:57:56,334 --> 01:57:59,667
but still l'm talking to you patiently,
and you're talking to arrogantly.

1606
01:58:01,739 --> 01:58:05,175
Hey Baby face! Your father insisted
on hitting you, so l did.

1607
01:58:10,448 --> 01:58:12,382
Think l couldn't have done this
in the first place?

1608
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:15,746
l thought you'd be dignified,
that we can talk fairly.

1609
01:58:19,724 --> 01:58:22,488
My mother asked me not to hit anyone
when she tied this around my wrist.

1610
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:28,599
But if she'd been around today,
she would have hit you too.

1611
01:58:30,768 --> 01:58:34,704
Pray God that the boy struggling
for his life should make it.

1612
01:58:35,072 --> 01:58:39,372
lf he doesn't,
even God can't save your lives.

1613
01:58:40,711 --> 01:58:45,239
You hit my son right before my eyes, right?

1614
01:58:46,817 --> 01:58:50,446
Your entry, attacking my son,
fighting my men,

1615
01:58:50,621 --> 01:58:53,954
everything that happened here is
recorded in my security camera.

1616
01:58:54,125 --> 01:58:56,457
l'll file case against you,
l'll get you arrested,

1617
01:58:56,627 --> 01:59:00,222
not that project, l'll ensure you
never construct any building in life.

1618
01:59:12,276 --> 01:59:13,334
This is jammer.

1619
01:59:14,312 --> 01:59:17,304
No electronic device works
when this is switched on.

1620
01:59:17,581 --> 01:59:18,843
My boys designed it.

1621
01:59:20,351 --> 01:59:21,511
This is HD camera.

1622
01:59:22,253 --> 01:59:23,914
Before l switched on the jammer,

1623
01:59:24,288 --> 01:59:26,848
l mean before l hit him,

1624
01:59:27,024 --> 01:59:31,120
whatever you said and your son said,
everything is recorded!

1625
01:59:31,295 --> 01:59:34,093
Using a transmitter l've sent
the video to my boys.

1626
01:59:34,832 --> 01:59:41,101
lf your son doesn't come in one hour
after l go and apologize to my boys,

1627
01:59:41,372 --> 01:59:43,135
l'll upload the video in YouTube

1628
01:59:43,607 --> 01:59:47,338
l'll handover a copy to print and TV media.

1629
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:52,272
l hope you're not as stupid as your son.

1630
02:00:08,499 --> 02:00:11,059
What are you doing here?
How come you're hurt...

1631
02:00:20,144 --> 02:00:22,044
You're hurt! Go lie down inside.

1632
02:00:22,213 --> 02:00:23,305
Getting bored inside.

1633
02:00:28,552 --> 02:00:30,611
Why are you playing with wheelchairs?
Stop it.

1634
02:00:30,855 --> 02:00:32,049
l'm telling you guys.

1635
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:42,255
Just say yes, we'll thrash them.

1636
02:00:43,267 --> 02:00:44,393
Violence is wrong.

1637
02:00:44,802 --> 02:00:46,167
l think he'll not come.

1638
02:01:10,895 --> 02:01:11,919
Say it quickly.

1639
02:01:24,608 --> 02:01:26,906
Hey! Anand has regained consciousness!

1640
02:01:27,078 --> 02:01:29,205
Doctor says he's out of danger, come!

1641
02:01:54,271 --> 02:01:57,798
He hit me in front of you...
you stood like a statue.

1642
02:01:58,242 --> 02:01:59,971
Then you made me say sorry to him.
Aren't you ashamed?

1643
02:02:00,177 --> 02:02:02,839
What you want me to do?
You wronged him.

1644
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:05,972
Had you told me a word with me,
it wouldn't have reached this stage.

1645
02:02:06,684 --> 02:02:09,244
He took my whole history with
a small camera.

1646
02:02:11,088 --> 02:02:12,555
l don't know who and all has it.

1647
02:02:12,723 --> 02:02:16,523
lf it comes out then my name.
My company.

1648
02:02:17,194 --> 02:02:20,527
Forget everything and
start some other business.

1649
02:02:20,965 --> 02:02:25,368
Your son is crying with insult..
you're worried about your company.

1650
02:02:26,737 --> 02:02:31,606
lf it comes to company or you,
l will prefer company.

1651
02:03:17,254 --> 02:03:20,189
Minister will be here any moment.
Where is Raghu?

1652
02:03:20,357 --> 02:03:22,791
He said he'd go to the temple
and come here directly.

1653
02:03:26,530 --> 02:03:27,189
Thank you, mother.

1654
02:03:27,998 --> 02:03:30,796
Did you call Raghu?
- l did, he'll be here in 5 minutes.

1655
02:03:47,885 --> 02:03:50,615
are you sure he's coming in this route?
- Yes, sir.

1656
02:03:50,921 --> 02:03:52,616
Sure?
- l know, sir.

1657
02:04:34,531 --> 02:04:37,125
l'm giving you all 30 seconds time.

1658
02:04:37,401 --> 02:04:41,963
Apologize to me and
my scooter for hitting me.

1659
02:04:42,106 --> 02:04:43,130
Or else?

1660
02:04:49,747 --> 02:04:50,975
l will hit you.

1661
02:07:44,521 --> 02:07:45,146
Start the car!

1662
02:07:46,023 --> 02:07:48,184
Start the car!
- Not starting, sir.

1663
02:07:48,325 --> 02:07:50,418
He's coming. Start the car.

1664
02:07:50,594 --> 02:07:51,492
l'm doing, sir.

1665
02:07:51,662 --> 02:07:53,095
Start the car!

1666
02:07:56,533 --> 02:07:57,329
Get down.

1667
02:07:59,937 --> 02:08:03,373
Don't do this...no...
lt's wrong.

1668
02:08:03,774 --> 02:08:05,105
You shouldn't do this.

1669
02:08:05,776 --> 02:08:07,266
Take your shirt off.
- No...

1670
02:08:07,444 --> 02:08:08,775
You know who my father is?

1671
02:08:08,946 --> 02:08:10,880
Give me.
- l'll not bother you anymore.

1672
02:08:20,324 --> 02:08:21,052
Hold this.

1673
02:08:31,301 --> 02:08:32,393
What is your problem?

1674
02:08:34,571 --> 02:08:37,301
Your parents didn't raise you properly.

1675
02:08:37,474 --> 02:08:39,465
Tell me, what is your problem?
