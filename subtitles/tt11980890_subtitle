00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,204
Petitioner Kumar! Lakshmi!

2
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,681
Petitioner Kumar! Lakshmi!

3
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,402
Petitioner Kumar! Lakshmi!

4
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:40,230
Petitioner Kumar! Lakshmi!

5
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:42,855
Everyone present?

6
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,136
Yes, my Lord!

7
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:47,394
My Lord...

8
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,198
Please...

9
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:51,905
Lakshmi, hope you
remember everything

10
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:53,645
What do you have to say?

11
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,231
I would like to workout
the marriage with my wife

12
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,519
And what do you say?

13
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:01,743
Sir, I cannot live with him.
Death sounds better than that!

14
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,940
Tell him he drinks and abuses you

15
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,205
He is an alcoholic, sir

16
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:08,313
He binge drinks and
abuses me like crazy!

17
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,460
Tell him about the sex torture

18
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:14,979
I forgot to mention this

19
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,804
He inflicts sexual tortures on me!

20
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:19,479
He tortures me too much,
day in and day out!

21
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,416
Sir, she is lying

22
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:24,168
My Lord, those words
don't seem to be hers

23
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,465
My client is innocent

24
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:31,013
These days innocents are more prone
to illicit actions, my Lord!

25
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,056
Next hearing on March 16th

26
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,102
Sir, I hope your boss
will get me the divorce

27
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:39,149
Come on! How can you
even doubt it, ma'am?

28
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:41,711
My boss hates even a
footwear being a couple!

29
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:43,067
He even keeps them separate!

30
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,489
So do you think he'll
let you stay married?

31
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:45,879
You start hunting for
you next husband!

32
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,403
-I don't have teach you!
-Fine, okay

33
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:48,810
500, 600, 700, 800...

34
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:51,049
I don't anyone by that name, sir

35
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:51,651
Sir...

36
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,721
-My name is Arokyasami
-Let it be

37
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:55,675
I would like to meet
advocate Prakash Raj

38
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,042
What's the matter...

39
00:04:58,143 --> 00:04:59,143
Err... Mr. Arokyasami

40
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,346
Whose family life has to be ruined?

41
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,042
No need to ruin anyone's family

42
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:04,135
Need to ruin them
from becoming a family

43
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:04,822
I'm confused

44
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,455
Need to break up two lovebirds

45
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,674
Lovebirds?

46
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:11,061
Sir, my boss does this as part
time job only for his close circle

47
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,894
How do you know?

48
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,565
Sir, I am a very close
friend of magistrate's driver

49
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:19,348
Sir, when can I meet your
boss at the bar council?

50
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,028
Mr. Arokyasami, these matters must
not be discussed in bar council

51
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:23,769
It must be discussed
in a bar over a drink

52
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:26,379
Come to "Hero's bar"
at evening 7 'O clock

53
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,512
I'll bring my boss
and we can discuss

54
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,136
Sir...

55
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:43,218
-All okay?
-Okay

56
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:45,392
Sir...

57
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,016
I am Arokyasami

58
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:51,339
I run a provision store in K K Nagar
and lead a very respectful life

59
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,082
So...

60
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:54,387
you mean other businessmen
lead a pathetic life?

61
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,020
Just tell your concern

62
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:57,755
You tell me, sir

63
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:01,982
Sir, my daughter is in love with a
guy who just won't suit our family

64
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,295
You must somehow  break them up

65
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,532
Who is that guy?
Where does he live?

66
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,196
Give me his full details

67
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,407

Parrys bus stand...

69
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:15,687
That's his regular hang out spot

70
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,921
As far as I have heard, the
guy seems to be a menace!

71
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,190
"Buddy, we greet here
everyone with a 'Namaste' "

72
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:38,644

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,997
"Tell me, what is your name?"

83
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:14,166
"Why don't you even bat an
eye, is this a love exam?"

84
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:19,236
"Be mine and I shall provide you
everyday with bun, butter and jam"

00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,265
"Flowers!"

91
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,531
"Can I buy some for you?"

92
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,304
"-A few?
-Not from you!"

93
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,601
"You are a flower"

94
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:55,124

"I'm a macho man from downtown,
and your love has knock me down"

102
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:28,224

Looks good?

143
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,875
Who's that monkey-face behind you?

144
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,065
God! That's my dad!

145
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:57,473
Is your daughter mommy's little
princess or daddy's little princess?

146
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:58,765
Of course daddy's little princess!

147
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:07,739
Cool, then do as I tell you

148
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,444
Dad, that guy in white tee

149
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:16,474
-The guy sitting on the bike
-One Samosa packet for my friend here

150
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:20,232
Wait here, dear. Let me go
and talk to my son-in-law

151
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,048
Dad...

152
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:24,337
Your happiness is
my happiness, dear

153
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:26,259
Don't you worry. Okay?

154
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:27,830
Here

155
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,586
No, thanks! I ate Pongal for
breakfast, I am already sleepy

156
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,100
You must eat it and
not go berserk on it!

157
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:35,201
Excuse me

158
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,171
Dear, would you mind
if I ask you this?

159
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:40,194
I won't mind if you ask me this...

160
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,799
but if you find it delicious and
ask one more, then I'd mind!

161
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,365
Dear...

162
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,250
Samosa is not what I was asking

163
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,612
Well, I was just joking!

164
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,961
I don't intend to share Samosa
with you. What's the matter?

165
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:54,924
It's crowded. Is that fine?

166
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,255
It's just him not a crowd. Just go
ahead and tell me what's the matter

167
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:00,396
Tell me this, is
your mother...

168
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,912
I asked... is your mother...

169
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,185
How dare you?

170
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:07,661
Father?

171
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,097
Why are you calling my father?
You 'Ladle Nose' fool!

172
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,122
Let's leave bro!

173
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,154
My mom is an angel and
look what he asked!

174
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,638
Come on, bro. You get on the bike

175
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:15,344
Daddy!

176
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:17,910
They seem to have roughed
you up real bad!

177
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,039
Don't ever come in
front of him again!

178
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:20,443
Evil fellow!

179
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:21,419
Please move

180
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,372
Are you his daughter?

181
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:23,770
Dad, what happened?

182
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,052
Something very embarrassing, dear

183
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:28,098
He asked "You are roaming around
and having fun with my daughter"

184
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,997
"Why don't you bring your parents
and ask her hand in marriage?"

185
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:31,990
That is all he asked him

186
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,466
He abused and roughed your
father up for asking that

187
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,576
He replied "I'm just having
an affair with your daughter"

188
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,264
"Marriage is out of question!"

189
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:39,662
And then he thrashed you father!

190
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:42,342
Rascal, didn't even show the heart
to respect an senior citizen

191
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:46,833
Thank God, at least you saw his
true colours before he married you

192
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,549
Do you still love
him after all this?

193
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:55,265
You don't even step into bar
to find a shade when it rains!

194
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:56,968
It hurts me to see you
in this condition!

195
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,315
-Yes, bro!
-Forget it

196
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:00,604
It's so hard to
understand these girls

197
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,658
Out of the blue she
blocked my calls

198
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,847
I went in person and confronted her

199
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,820
She said "I'm getting married
next month. Don't stalk me!"

200
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,016
Something fishy has
happened for sure!

201
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,443
Isn't that her monkey-face father?

202
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,897
Sir...

203
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:25,409
my daughter's marriage is fixed

204
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,435
The right thing to do
is to invite God first

205
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,299
Sir, you're my God!

206
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:32,252
You must come with your family
and bless the couple, sir

207
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:38,411
Sir, that guy is here!

208
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,021
Which guy?

209
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,974
The guy whom my daughter was seeing

210
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,997
So, it was this man who
buried my love alive?

211
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,551
Sir, he's picking
up the beer bottle

212
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:47,660
Don't you worry

213
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,152
-He's coming to attack me
-Don't worry, I'm here

214
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,230
Sir, he's nearing us

215
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,316
Sir, careful. He's
almost behind you

216
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:58,421
Jeyaraj!

217
00:13:58,897 --> 00:13:59,632
Dad!

218
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,022
You can!

219
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:17,115
-Who said I can't?
-I meant...

220
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:17,858
Is that a water can?

221
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,548
Who's that?

222
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,759
Alright

223
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:24,556
-Alright, sir
-Excuse me

224
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:25,804
I want to meet Parris Jeyaraj

225
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:26,649
I don't know

226
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,548
Hello! Come here

227
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,556
'Medhu vada' and 'Pongal'
are the best combo

228
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,040
Tell us whom you're looking for?

229
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,976
We would like to
meet Parris Jeyaraj

230
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,157
That's our bro!

231
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:37,293
So...

232
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,155
where do you come from?

233
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:40,969
Huh? Shut up you dumb!

234
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:43,952
Whoa! Whoa! Looks like
you're a hot head!

235
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:45,913
Wanna match neck to neck to with us?

236
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,046
Excuse me, Ms. Calypso...

237
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,101
try going neck to
neck with our bro!

238
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,633
-Come on, darling
-Come on

239
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:52,312
Come on

240
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:07,780
Bro...

241
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:09,192
they are here in search of you

242
00:15:09,248 --> 00:15:10,820
When did I get lost?

243
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,804
Why are they searching for me?

244
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:17,525
You know I'm allergic to girls!
Chase them away!

245
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:19,965
We'd like you to sing at
our college culturals

246
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,198
Hi

247
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:38,553
As far as the music world
is concerned, I am no more!

248
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:40,965
And right now I exist in...

249
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:41,890
Kailash...

250
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:45,397
I'm just following the
path laid by Lord Shiva

251
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:48,990
This foot will step
into a local bar but...

252
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,646
never onto a stage!

253
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:51,579
Careful, bro

254
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,082
You're a good singer

255
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,746
People find happiness in your song

256
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,090
But now you've become a
drunkard in depression

257
00:15:58,152 --> 00:16:01,387
Not just by looks but you're
smart in every aspect!

258
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:04,270
So don't mind me telling you this

259
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:06,637
Love is not like the sea shore

260
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:08,270
Love is like a sea wave

261
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,725
When one falls another one rises

262
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:16,974
We must decide which
wave to wet our legs in

263
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:21,287
We love and buy a dress

264
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,014
If it tears, we can stitch it

265
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:25,062
But when we lose it,
don't we buy a new one?

266
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,093
Just like that...

267
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,425
move on!

268
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,275
True!

269
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,166
When clouds melt, it rains

270
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,807
When it moves, shadows fall

271
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,433
Doesn't suit you! Not at all!

272
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,940
Even sidekicks are talking
philosophies to me!

273
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,713
So that's how pathetic
my life is, isn't it?

274
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:45,026
You doofus...

275
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:47,139
why play a background music for me?

276
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,881
The girl who left you is now
happy being someone's wife

277
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:51,654
Then why are you
living a dull life?

278
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:53,707
-Have you ever been in love?
-Bro!

279
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:55,980
-Poor girl
-Don't show your anger on her, bro

280
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:00,972
"Jeyaraj, my father is not well"

281
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:03,261
"My mother has taken
him to the hospital"

282
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,526
"I am alone at home"
When she told me this...

283
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,158
I thought I'll go and pacify her

284
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:11,453
But guess what she did
to me when I went there?

285
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,267
Well...

286
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,205
She did nasty things to
me that cannot be said!

287
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:17,666
Then what happened?

288
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:20,659
Then she left me and
married someone else!

289
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,885
Bro! Please, don't cry

290
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,844
Get lost! You girls better leave

291
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:33,577
When you love someone...

292
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:35,797
with more than what you can...

293
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,290
They will spit poison like
a cobra with its fang!

294
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,326
So, that's all?

295
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,333
That's all!

296
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,130
I am out of booze

297
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,269
At home, mom would have
prepared dry fish gravy

298
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:50,427
Time to eat and sleep

299
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:51,450
So, that's all?

300
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:54,292
That is all!

301
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:57,091
How about few words...

302
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,106
and if possible, a cup of coffee?

303
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,684
Having coffee after
boozing makes me nauseous

304
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:04,953
No, thanks

305
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,166
So, that's all?

306
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,976
I said "That's it" in all three
possible modulation I could

307
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,442
If you ask me once again...

308
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,630
-Control, bro
-Girls, run!

309
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:17,958
Girls, leave!

310
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:18,629
-Leave!
-Come, let's leave!

311
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:21,248
-Don't wait until he stabs you! Leave!
-Just leave!

312
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,093
Poor bro, he's already so upset

313
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:25,118
Dear, I am asking you!

314
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:26,875
Okay

315
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,812
Where are you going often at night?
What's going on?

316
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:34,059
You talk like I roam and
wander around like your son!

317
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:39,224
Tell me, who  puts the
food on the table here?

318
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,090
Who's that barking here?

319
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,190
Mom...

320
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,101
what's his problem?

321
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,438
You just say the word

322
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:47,420
and I'll punch him!

323
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,610
Just shut up! Calm down

324
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:50,674
You drink and wander the
streets all the time

325
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:52,892
And he works all the time
and seldom comes home

326
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:54,892
Ain't I coming home
every alternate days?

327
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,244
Are you a corporation water?
 to come on alternate days!

328
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,486
Mom, just say the word...

329
00:18:58,699 --> 00:18:59,800
and I'll punch him!

330
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:03,379
Earnings from high court cases alone
won't be enough to run this family

331
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:06,855
I keep running to Chengalpattu
and Poonamalle courts

332
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:09,472
But you guys keep questioning me!

333
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,824
I toil hard like a
dog for this family!

334
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,886
What do you guys do for me?

335
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:16,668
How about I buy you
some dog biscuits?

336
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:19,129
Is this how you treat your dad?

337
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:22,356
Is he a posh breed? How about
I treat him with Pedigree?

338
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,098
Mom, don't be scared of him.
Just say the word...

339
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:24,925
and I'll punch him!

340
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:27,614
Why do you wanna get upset
and start for work?

341
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:28,904
Who started it all?

342
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,919
Fine, leave it. Go
and come home safe

343
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,465
Hope you'll come
home tomorrow night

344
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,183
In that case I'll
call and inform you!

345
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:36,340
If you fail to call then in
that case I'll punch you!

346
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,597
Mom, just say the word...

347
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:39,019
and I'll punch him!

348
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:40,599
Jeyaraj!

349
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:41,724
Prakash Raj!

350
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:42,968
Thank you!

351
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,262
Love is not like the sea shore

352
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:50,762
Love is like a sea wave

353
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,505
When one falls another one rises

354
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,919
We must decide which
wave to wet our legs in

355
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:11,601
Stop torturing me with the
background music at late night 1:30!

356
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,164
What are you doing under me?

357
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:20,341
To prevent you from falling

358
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:24,161
God! She's taking my breath away!

359
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:29,225
I can't take it! She's
torturing me in my dreams!

360
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,199
The girl who left you is now
happy being someone's wife

361
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,989
Then why are you
living a dull life?

362
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,119
Ramani, looks like
your son has changed

363
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:44,770
What happened?

364
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:47,398
Ask him! Ask him!

365
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:49,252
Ask him, dear

366
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,963
What's up Mr. Wicked face!

367
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,690
What's the confusion there?

368
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,783
What's up with you? You look great!

369
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,862
Where are you off to so
early in the morning?

370
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:57,909
For an interview, mom

371
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:01,143
Neither did you prepare for it
nor you're carrying a file

372
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:05,911
There! Give some space and you'll
climb on my head and kick me!

373
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,674
"Those who do drugs and
binge on doughnuts..."

374
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,854
"and those who get
high and binge on pie..."

375
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:14,690
"end up living a life
that they will regret"

376
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:15,900
I didn't understand that!

377
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:16,823
You swear?

378
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:17,581
I swear!

379
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:18,432
Got hurt?

380
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:19,689
Well, that was the idea

381
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:23,056
-What happened?
-I was bluffing. It doesn't hurt!

382
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:24,493
Nothing at all

383
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:28,699
Who is it?

384
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,215
Is that our bro, Parris Jeyaraj?

385
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:31,347
Yes, Maharaja!

386
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,714
Let's booze, come on

387
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:37,636
Starting today let's reform

388
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:38,925
That makes us mourn!

389
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:42,073
I'll stop rhyming and
break your jaws!

390
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:44,440
-Get the costume and meet me at the college
-Okay, bro

391
00:21:47,643 --> 00:21:50,616
-Look it's Parris Jeyaraj!
-That's him! Whoa!

392
00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:51,827
He's a Youtube star!

393
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,163
Greetings, bro! Welcome! Welcome!

394
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:57,475
Not even a single chick around

395
00:21:57,476 --> 00:21:59,343
-He's here
-Bro is here

396
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:00,288
Welcome, bro

397
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:02,637
Hold it!

398
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:05,505
What are you guys doing here?

399
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:07,270
Your girlfriend said she
has an 'audit to run'

400
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:08,496
 So she asked
us to wait here

401
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:12,018
-Let's wait for her here
-Let's check out what audit she's running

402
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:13,281
No, let's wait

403
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,883
Bro, she is here

404
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:18,359
Your girl looks amazing
in candy coloured saree!

405
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:21,747
Hi

406
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:23,646
Excuse me, I saw you

407
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,432
I know what you saw in me!

408
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:28,626
Excuse me! How long
do we have to wait for you?

409
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,010
Excuse me! We must say that

410
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,048
What did she tell you?

411
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,260
She said she has an 'audit
to run', so wait here

412
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,510
I said "That's the auditorium, wait there"

413
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,047
You toad face!

414
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:42,961
Fool!

415
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,013
Auditorium means
library in English!

416
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:49,882
Knowledge-less fellows!

417
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:51,507
So, tell me

418
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:53,140
You said you won't turn up

419
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,827
After a lot of thinking
with you in my bed...

420
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,694
I mean, after a lot of thinking
about what you said...

421
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:04,754
You took leave with an "I'm suffering
from fever" excuse, just to meet me

422
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:07,183
-What is he thinking?
-I slept over it the whole night. Yes!

423
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:10,283
Morning-woke up! Then-Took bath!
Bike-I took it!

424
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,244
Then- Filled gas

425
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,650
On road-I drove but traffic!

426
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:17,033
Drove left, right and straight!

427
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:18,697
I drove down - full speed

428
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,088
Finally, we met

429
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:21,060
Promise!

430
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:22,072
No drinks

431
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,549
Hereafter... continuous...

432
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:25,666
life-disciplined!

433
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:27,830
Me-reformed!

434
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,900
-Super explanation, bro!
-Excuse me...

435
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:31,190
What's you point actually?

436
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,150
You didn't understand any of that?

437
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:37,806
-Not a zilch!
-I didn't understand

438
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:38,799
Fine, okay

439
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:42,952
We thought you won't show up.
Hence, we got another singer

440
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,027
Sorry

441
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,921
If you want, you can stand
aside and watch the show

442
00:23:48,311 --> 00:23:50,585
-Bro, coat rent is 500 rupees!
-The chief guest is here

443
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:51,377
-Come
-Okay

444
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,124
-Excuse me
-Sister!

445
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:57,809
Hey look! It's Parris Jeyaraj!

446
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,802
Lift him! Let's celebrate him!

447
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:01,754
Parris! Parris!

448
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,051
My dear fans, who
live in my heart...

449
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:06,379
Greetings to you all!

450
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:10,487
-Parris! Parris!
-Hi! Hi! Okay! Okay!

451
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,354
Guess the whole college is
waiting for me! What a crowd!

452
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:16,236
What's happening here?

453
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:18,770
Guys, wait! Take selfies
but one by one...

454
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,903
-So wasn't they cheering for me?
-Watch out, bro!

455
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,254
They are cheering for him

456
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,489
-What's going on?
-Come, let's go

457
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:26,137
They's celebrating
him instead of me!

458
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,492
I knew him when he was a nothing
and now look at him showing off!

459
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:30,914
Let's leave at once!

460
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:35,157
Here, you talk

461
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:37,572
Madam...

462
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:41,336
he got a call to participate
in "Man vs Wild"

463
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:44,000
They want someone to sing
'Gaana' song in the forest

464
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:46,033
So, we left immediately

465
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:49,861
No bruises or injuries otherwise

466
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:52,017
-Did they ask that?
-He's not upset

467
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:54,012
What?

468
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:55,382
Return the advance money?

469
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:58,007
We'll compensate that during 'Aadi'
month festival show! Hang up now

470
00:24:58,968 --> 00:24:59,781
What happened?

471
00:25:00,156 --> 00:25:01,078
He left

472
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,934
Oh my God!

473
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,684
Let's request Parris

474
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:08,518
Come again!

475
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,313
Our bro ain't a dummy doll to
stand aside and watch the show!

476
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:14,047
He's the big show!

477
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:15,744
Selfie? One by one, please!

478
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:16,852
Please, go!

479
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:18,719
Come... Come...

480
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,780
Where is the camera?

481
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:22,436
Oh! You again?

482
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:26,413
Would you please be the chief
guest and perform for us?

483
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:28,312
Please sing a song for us

484
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:29,312
Dude, please ask him to sing

485
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:30,986
Well, I thought you
had a better choice

486
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:33,663
You even asked me to stand
aside and watch the show

487
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,452
You thought I was some desperate
oldie because I volunteered for you

488
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:39,918
-Where is your singer?
-Jeyaraj...

489
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:40,887
He fled the spot already, bro

490
00:25:40,902 --> 00:25:43,176
He ditched us at the last minute

491
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,436
Only you can save us
from embarrassment

492
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,717
Please don't mind...

493
00:25:46,983 --> 00:25:50,249
I think I'm coming down with a cold
because I'm drenched in my fans' love

494
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,749
I don't think I'll be able to sing

495
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,610
Come on, don't say so

496
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:57,451
You didn't get that?

497
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,323
Okay

498
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,220
Fans' love- rain - drenched

499
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,074
Coughs...

500
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:04,004
Colds...

501
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:05,125
So I can't sing

502
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:06,995
Now what?

503
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:09,559
This is not the time to play, sir

504
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:10,480
Please!

505
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,122
Boss! Please sing a song for us!

506
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,014
-Just one song!
-Come on, sing for us!

507
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:18,092
Okay! Okay!

508
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:21,858
-Okay! Okay!
-Parris! Parris!

509
00:26:22,654 --> 00:26:25,334
Fine, not for you but
I'll sing for my fans

510
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:27,442
But you must apologize
in 'Dubai' style

511
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:29,909
What's that?

512
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:34,555
Well, hug tight like Sheiks do and
then apologize. Then I shall agree!

513
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,524
-Just do it, we don't have a choice
-Yes!

514
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:39,602
Okay

515
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:43,550
Doesn't feel like 'Dubai' style

516
00:26:44,441 --> 00:26:45,542
Do it!

517
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:51,128
There you go!

518
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:52,664
You guys also

519
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,370
It's okay

520
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:55,370
Awesome bro!

521
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,597
Parris! Parris!

522
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,598
"A girl stole my heart"

523
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:16,020
"A love, I feel that
will never fall apart"

524
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:18,387
"Her love makes me
feel awesome, buddy"

525
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,699
"Hereafter she's my honey"

526
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:23,254
"The twist of my life as
my heart skipped a beat"

527
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:25,653
"Show some mercy on me
because I'm completely lost"

528
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:26,785
"Break it!"

529
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,231
"So break it..."

530
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,528
"So break it to me, baby"

531
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:34,856
"Confess your love for me"

532
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,403
"Let me hear you say it
in your sweet voice"

533
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,992
 "Like this 'Gaana'? Click the
bell icon and make some noise"

534
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:45,984
"Even during the day she
shines like a star"

535
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:47,234
"Yes she does!"

536
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,839
"From head to toe
she's a milky bar"

537
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,292
"Yes she is! Just like a milky bar!"

538
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:58,715
"A beauty never seen before, so good;
A look from her and that's my food"

539
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,184
"A princess on the charriot;
A drug the boys have never seen yet"

540
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:09,168
"Trust me, I'm not trying to flatter
you! My heart is already yours"

541
00:28:09,293 --> 00:28:14,824
"Allow me to be your better half and
I promise I will do all the chores"

542
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,309
"Break it!"

543
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:18,864
"So break it..."

544
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,960
"So break it to me, baby"

545
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,101
"Confess your love for me"

546
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:26,476
"Let me hear you say it
in your sweet voice"

547
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,898
 "Like this 'Gaana'? Click the
bell icon and make some noise"

548
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,473
 "Like this 'Gaana'? Click the
bell icon and make some noise"

549
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:34,121
 "Like this 'Gaana'? Then..."

550
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:37,192
"Click the bell icon
and make some noise"

551
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:51,022
You said you will
sing in one breath!

552
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,241
I forgot about it

553
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:55,389
Okay, I will sing the
footnote in one breath

554
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:59,581
"She's a whirlwind
from the Artic ocean"

555
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,971
"A beauty that gets
every man's attention"

556
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:04,221
"Even her anger sounds like
the song of a nightingale"

557
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,622
"She has disturbed me in every way"

558
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,536
"So, I got up and ran to confess my love;
Waiting for a reply from this dove"

559
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:16,305
"A jokey is nothing without his horse;
a man is nothing without his spouse"

560
00:29:16,352 --> 00:29:18,800
"Every word she
says is a poem; If she

561
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,454
becomes mine then
I'll know how lucky I am"

562
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:24,262
Is your smoking habit acting up?

563
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:28,040
"Trust me..."

564
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:32,680
"Trust me, I'm not trying to flatter
you! My heart is already yours"

565
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,271
"Allow me to be your better half and
I promise I will do all the chores"

566
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:40,599
"Break it!"

567
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:43,053
"So break it..."

568
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:45,154
"So break it to me, baby"

569
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,630
"Confess your love for me"

570
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:49,997
"Let me hear you say it
in your sweet voice"

571
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,403
"Like this 'Gaana'? Then click the
bell icon and make some noise"

572
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:53,580
"Like this 'Gaana'? Then click

573
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:54,809
the bell icon and
make some noise"

574
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,825
"Like this 'Gaana'?"

575
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,124
"Then click the bell icon
and make some noise"

576
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,779
Mr. advocate, remember me?

577
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:27,090
Please come, madam

578
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:29,293
Sir?

579
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:30,046
Get a coffee

580
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:31,075
Okay, sir

581
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:33,111
Have a seat

582
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:36,359
What's with the sudden visit?

583
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,320
Why aren't you picking my calls?

584
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:43,388
Remember daughter's issues I told
you about. Did you take any action?

585
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:45,633
I was out today
morning, working on it

586
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:46,805
Really?

587
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:47,631
Promise!

588
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:51,008
I'll solve the issue within two
days and meet you in person

589
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,086
Don't worry

590
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:53,695
Can I trust you?

591
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,828
100%!

592
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,782
Fine, I'll leave then

593
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:00,384
Yeah

594
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:03,776
Excuse me!

595
00:31:04,648 --> 00:31:06,036
The coffee is here.
Please, have some

596
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:07,399
No, thanks

597
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:10,860
Who's that tube light, boss?

598
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:12,758
She glows like one
without any power

599
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:15,094
Some smart fellow is
lucky to be her husband!

600
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:16,456
She is a client

601
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,120
He daughter is in love with someone

602
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:19,573
I even got an advance payment

603
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,175
You take advance from everyone...

604
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:23,971
but when I ask for money you
perform like you got none!

605
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:25,135
Come on, boss!

606
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,352
Pour me some coffee first

607
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:32,595
Mom, why do you go through all these
troubles to do the house chores?

608
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,595
Who else will do it?

609
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:39,374
Have you seen those helper
girls in Oscar award function?

610
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,888
I'll bring home
a girl like that!

611
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:44,374
Such modern girls won't look
good doing chores around here

612
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,055
Mom!

613
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:47,181
Our family has a status!

614
00:31:47,314 --> 00:31:48,128
Indeed!

615
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:51,001
But that status goes down the
drain every time you drink

616
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:53,751
I won't create any
ruckus anymore, mom

617
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:57,491
Such promises gives me
a panic attack threat

618
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,890
I'm here now to save you if
you have a panic attack now

619
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,850
If no one's around, you'd be gone!

620
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:05,061
That's why we need someone
at home all the time

621
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,167
Mom...

622
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,819
Come here

623
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:10,930
Look at this

624
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:12,522
Shall I zoom in?

625
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,887
How is she? Check her
out in left profile

626
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,144
How is she? Tell me!

627
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:18,496
Angel so divine;
looking so fine!

628
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:21,593
Please! Let me also see her

629
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:24,515
I'll show her but then you'll
show your true colour!

630
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:28,664
All you like is to burn the old
things during the festival of Bhogi...

631
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,961
and to break up every family!

632
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:33,073
Jeyaraj...

633
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,906
if that girl has changed you
so much in a single day...

634
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:37,551
then don't miss her at any cost

635
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:48,630
Excuse me, what's this?

636
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,196
Food department officer for
'Medhu vada' making

637
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:52,868
It's too oily. Go ahead, eat it

638
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:53,865
What's wrong with him?

639
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:55,610
Seriously?

640
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:57,727
Hi! Hi!

641
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:00,253
What is it?

642
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:02,057
Why are you all staring
in to empty plates?

643
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:03,495
Shall I order something to eat?

644
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:05,775
10 Idlies and lentil
sambar for you girls

645
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,337
No thanks!

646
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:07,095
And for you...

647
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:08,371
8 Idlies and prawn gravy!

648
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,019
No, thanks. It's okay

649
00:33:10,246 --> 00:33:12,738
How about some meat dishes?
It'll taste delicious!

650
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:13,376
Shall I order?

651
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:14,949
Come on! Just leave it

652
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:16,589
Are you here to meet someone?

653
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,159
Yes, her!

654
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,806
But had a change of mood. So
thought I'll visit you instead

655
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:24,775
Come on, whom else
do I know here?

656
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,099
I came to meet you

657
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:27,794
Tell me

658
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,302
What is the matter?

659
00:33:29,756 --> 00:33:31,967
I got a Lord Hanuman photo
in a forward message

660
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:34,519
And it said "Send it to10 people
and you'll have good luck"

661
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,983
You wanted my welfare and so it'd be
only right if I reciprocate it too

662
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:41,140
So I thought I'll get your number
and forward you this photo

663
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:43,038
Can I have your number, please?

664
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,684
I'll give a call. Note my number

665
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:52,661
Hi baby!

666
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:53,607
Darling!

667
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:55,117
I am waiting for you

668
00:33:55,187 --> 00:33:56,796
So you knew I'd come?

669
00:33:56,898 --> 00:33:58,734
I've been waiting for a while now

670
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,828
My dear angle so divine!

671
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:02,664
Here after always I'll be on time!

672
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:03,508
Will you?

673
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:07,359
I swear on Lord Jesus, Lord Blackwood,
Lord Buckethead and all the Gods!

674
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,392
I'll be punctual!

675
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:10,340
You reached?

676
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:11,536
Where are you?

677
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:15,024
Where are you looking at?

678
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:16,320
I am here

679
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,464
Okay, bye!

680
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,830
Who is that Mr. Dimwit face?

681
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:29,456
Boyfriend

682
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,948
All these days she was single

683
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,347
God!

684
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:35,665
She got committed just a month ago

685
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,165
What are you gonna do now?

686
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:43,103
What can I do if the thread
to fly kite is not yet ready?

687
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:51,816
So, I was eagerly waiting for the
order that was for the next table?

688
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:56,174
Fine, order something for us to eat

689
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,248
Right!

690
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:58,823
Like I'm gonna do that!

691
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,932
Smart and clever witches!

692
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,417
Asks me for free food!

693
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:04,206
Mrs. Oily food lover...

694
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,891
Here, take a bite

695
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:06,625
Have it

696
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,918
-I am heartbroken here
-Ramani! Ramani!

697
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,809
-Look what he is doing to me!
-Jeyaraj!

698
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:40,622
What are you doing?
Leave him alone!

699
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,381
No matter what, he's your dad!

700
00:35:42,428 --> 00:35:44,531
Whoa! That's so bad!

701
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:46,281
You promised you'd behave hereafter

702
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,649
How does this look to you?

703
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,023
This is still a behaviour

704
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,508
Why are you directing the anger
on someone else on to me?

705
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:54,726
For the same reason why onions price
peak when the truck owners go on strike!

706
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,801
For the same reason why Gandhiji's
birthday is declared a dry day!

707
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:59,629
Look at my son's talking skill

708
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:01,121
Thankfully I don't
have a weapon to kill!

709
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:02,911
You better shut up!

710
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,871
Why are you creating a ruckus now?

711
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:06,558
Wasn't everything fine when you
stepped out in the morning?

712
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:07,952
Well who said everything was fine?

713
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,671
Everything was ruined!

714
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:12,616
I thought if she becomes
mine, my life would be great

715
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:13,810
It's all over now!

716
00:36:13,974 --> 00:36:15,506
Just tell us what happened?

717
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,350
Spit it out!

718
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:18,233
She loves another girl

719
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,288
Eww! What?

720
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,701
Yes the guy she is in love
with looks almost like a girl

721
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:25,475
This is my forte! Can I speak?

722
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,858
"Even this whole world is against you"

723
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,413
"Even if they say 'You are a loser!
A loser! Loser!' "

724
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:34,592
I am losing my patience mister!

725
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:37,618
You can't even advise
your own son properly!

726
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:39,657
Instead you're just
saying movie dialogues!

727
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:42,048
Dear, let your dad speak

728
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:44,384
We must never let him speak!

729
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:45,837
Instead he deserves a kick!

730
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:48,401
He is the sole reason why my life
is messed up in the first place!

731
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:50,618
Just give me that guy's info

732
00:36:50,844 --> 00:36:53,267
In 15 days his love
story will be done for

733
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,046
You shut up and go to sleep now!

734
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:56,858
Don't ruin other's life

735
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:02,018
"She flew away..."

736
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,861
"She forgot me forever..."

737
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:10,565
Leave!

738
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:12,338
You better leave!

739
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:17,403
How dare...

740
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:18,177
Stop!

741
00:37:26,237 --> 00:37:27,126
I'm tired of him!

742
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:28,415
What's the time?

743
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:29,626
Boss, any minute now

744
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:31,887
Boss, here she comes

745
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:32,928
Why are you late?

746
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:34,851
Now that I am here,
just tell me what to do

747
00:37:34,906 --> 00:37:36,069
The gym at the second floor

748
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:38,351
I have already sent you
his photos in Whatsapp

749
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:39,734
-Hope you saw them
-Yes, I did

750
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,422
Hope you remember the instructions

751
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:42,507
Go ahead

752
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:49,222
Will he fall?

753
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,496
He'll definitely fall for her moves

754
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:54,355
Boss, I have a doubt

755
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:56,339
How many such connections you got?

756
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:57,807
Don't make me slap you!

757
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,347
Slap me! I'll take it!

758
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,589
But set me up someone
like that and then slap

759
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:11,991
Hi

760
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,217
Are you Dr. Venkat?

761
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:37,043
Yeah

762
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,659
I think I've seen you
in some TV interviews

763
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:43,215
-Is it?
-Yes

764
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:45,142
Yes, boss?

765
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,492
The way she is talking...

766
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,938
looks like he'll
surely fall for her

767
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,735
No doubts, boss. Confirm!

768
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:54,352
-Thank you
-You're most welcome

769
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,056
So, we'll meet in the evening?

770
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:56,746
Yeah

771
00:38:57,314 --> 00:38:58,005
Thank you

772
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,407
Excuse me

773
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:03,081
You didn't tell me your room number

774
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,560
It's 131

775
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:05,752
Catch you then. Bye

776
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:09,674
Fine, don't give me snacks
but at least give him some

777
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:15,784
What is this? You said
you were reformed!

778
00:39:15,846 --> 00:39:16,784
Here she comes!

779
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:18,775
Indeed I'm a reformed man

780
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,778
In between I was out of my senses

781
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:23,261
But I've changed now

782
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,973
So again you've quit singing?

783
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:28,268
I find happiness in only two things

784
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:29,503
In singing...

785
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,042
and in drinking

786
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:33,237
-Awesome, bro!
-Leave that

787
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:34,620
Why are you here?

788
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,472
Tomorrow's my boyfriend's birthday

789
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:40,417
It would be a great surprise
if you sing for him

790
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:42,329
-Bro!
-You just come and...

791
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,241
Uh-oh!

792
00:39:43,274 --> 00:39:44,759
Cool down, bro. Please

793
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:46,092
What happened?

794
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:50,469
Well, will you serve white rice
or fried rice at the function?

795
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:53,941
Is it a buffet or A la carte?

796
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:55,246
I shall pay you

797
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:57,613
Well, no need of that

798
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:01,269
If I sing "Happy birthday" for
someone's "Happy birthday"...

799
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:02,456
and if that makes you happy...

800
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:04,596
then I am happy to sing
'Happy birthday' for him!

801
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,338
Wow!

802
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,752
In one 'Happy birthday' how
many 'Happy birthdays'

803
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,557
I will be waiting for you

804
00:40:15,315 --> 00:40:17,111
Can you say it once more

805
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:19,330
I will be waiting for you!

806
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,033
Once more please! Please!

807
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:25,383
I will be waiting for you!

808
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:28,420
What's so funny?

809
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:30,195
Just leave

810
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:31,975
-Just leave
-Let's leave

811
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,967
"Where is heaven? In booze!"

812
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:37,412
"What's special on Gandhi Jayanthi?
No booze!"

813
00:40:43,804 --> 00:40:46,320
"Hold your horses!
I can see 17 bottles!"

814
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:49,738
"That's enough I say!
Happy birthday!"

815
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:53,042
"Hold your horses!
I can see 17 bottles!"

816
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:56,348
"That's enough I say!
Happy birthday!"

817
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:05,281
"I'm high! I'm high! I
gulped down a full bottle"

818
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:08,341
"I'm wasted! I'm wasted! Now
the whole show has gone awful"

819
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:11,489
"I'm high! I'm high! I
gulped down a full bottle"

820
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,544
"I'm wasted! I'm wasted! Now
the whole show has gone awful"

821
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:17,841
"If they bark at you;
listen and ignore!"

822
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:20,802
"Keep calm and walk away!
But remember food is bae!"

823
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:23,692
"No more tension!
This is our hero's function!"

824
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:25,952
"Our hero is a jolly good human!"

825
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:27,788
"Man! Man!"

826
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:30,984
"I'm high! I'm high! I
gulped down a full bottle"

827
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:34,114
"I'm wasted! I'm wasted! Now
the whole show has gone awful"

828
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:37,161
"I'm high! I'm high! I
gulped down a full bottle"

829
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:40,293
"I'm wasted! I'm wasted! Now
the whole show has gone awful"

830
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:55,346
"Let me tell you about this guy;
All his stories are a lie!"

831
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,690
"Never lose your smile;
Live like Chris Gayle"

832
00:41:58,745 --> 00:42:04,954
"You called and we came running;
Like Lord Hanuman, we are very loving"

833
00:42:05,344 --> 00:42:11,110
"Get married and settle down;
Yet there will be many stalkers around"

834
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:14,555
"Don't encourage them!
Chase them away"

835
00:42:14,596 --> 00:42:17,195
"But don't break the law and
handle it in smooth way"

836
00:42:17,227 --> 00:42:20,250
"No more tension!
This is our hero's function!"

837
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:22,399
"Our hero is a jolly good human!"

838
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:23,508
"Man! Man!"

839
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:26,417
"I'm high! I'm high! I
gulped down a full bottle"

840
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:29,530
"I'm wasted! I'm wasted! Now
the whole show has gone awful"

841
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:33,057
"Hello! Hello!"

842
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,935
"We wish the couple a great future
and the guy a happy birthday"

843
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:38,396
"Yours lovingly
- Parris Jeyaraj's troop"

844
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,888
"Please do contact for shows"

845
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,292
"Trials are over. Time
to face the reality"

846
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:54,340
"All these days I was sober but now
I'll perform to my full capacity"

847
00:42:54,386 --> 00:42:57,379
"Yes, so far he was sober!"

848
00:42:57,715 --> 00:43:00,668
"My schooling is done but I'm
yet to do my life's homework"

849
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:03,332
"How was that line? Thanks to
Oscar winner Dark Knight Joker"

850
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:06,421
"I will compete with you neck to neck;
Roasting is my knack"

851
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:09,632
"No more tension!
This is our hero's function!"

852
00:43:09,913 --> 00:43:11,561
"Our hero is a jolly good human!"

853
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,718
"Man! Man!"

854
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,651
"I'm high! I'm high! I
gulped down a full bottle"

855
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:18,667
"I'm wasted! I'm wasted! Now
the whole show has gone awful"

856
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:21,885
"I'm high! I'm high! I
gulped down a full bottle"

857
00:43:21,987 --> 00:43:24,773
"I'm wasted! I'm wasted!
And made the show awful"

858
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:27,578
"Hold your horses!
I can see 17 bottles!"

859
00:43:27,914 --> 00:43:30,703
"That's enough I say!
Happy birthday!"

860
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:33,677
"Hold your horses!
I can see 17 bottles!"

861
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:36,724
"That's enough I say!
Happy birthday!"

862
00:43:55,742 --> 00:43:56,526
Keep quiet

863
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:58,453
Look at that!

864
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:00,313
Dude, look! It's Venkat!

865
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,294
Awesome, bro! Perfect timing!

866
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,411
Well, that...

867
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:17,701
Well, I...

868
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:21,215
Div...

869
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:23,275
Ridiculous!

870
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:36,328
Please don't cry

871
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:43,065
Chapter 232 verse 114
tells us that...

872
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:46,427
"On seeing it grow
beyond the finger..."

873
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,849
"we cut the finger nail
fearing it may cause danger"

874
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:52,475
"It's no sin for us
to keep weeping"

875
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:55,386
That's what it says

876
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,120
If something is leaving us...

877
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,612
then doesn't it mean something
new is approaching us?

878
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,775
If the God is removing a
unsuitable person from our life...

879
00:45:04,846 --> 00:45:07,611
then doesn't it mean God is sending
a suitable person into our life?

880
00:45:08,213 --> 00:45:08,978
The right person...

881
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:11,440
will be ready to do
anything for you

882
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:13,644
And not someone who cheats on you!

883
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:15,204
The right person...

884
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,773
could be someone you
went looking for

885
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:19,188
And for you...

886
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:20,984
he would have quit drinking

887
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:23,891
He could also be a 'gaana' singer

888
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,172
In fact, his name could be...

889
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:28,576
Parris Jeyaraj!

890
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:32,483
"On seeing it grow
beyond the finger..."

891
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:37,688
She left?

892
00:46:09,217 --> 00:46:10,678
What happened to my son?

893
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:14,473
Venkat!

894
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:17,466
Not the plight we'd
like to see you in!

895
00:46:18,497 --> 00:46:21,062
What are these powder
lines here by the light?

896
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:22,505
Boss!

897
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:24,453
I understood, boss!

898
00:46:24,773 --> 00:46:26,914
Since you can't bare
his current plight...

899
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:29,133
then at least see those powder
lines by the light!

900
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:32,026
He's talking to you
in morse code, boss!

901
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:34,695
Guess, he's exhausted
making those lines

902
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,183
Why don't you complete the puzzle?

903
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:37,956
You!

904
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:42,735
What's all this?

905
00:46:45,298 --> 00:46:46,517
This is cocaine!

906
00:46:47,063 --> 00:46:48,407
That was all I had!

907
00:46:48,564 --> 00:46:49,485
And you wasted it!

908
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:51,578
Without this I'll go crazy!

909
00:46:51,703 --> 00:46:53,914
Do you have any sense?
Get lost from here!

910
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,570
What happened to my son?

911
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,406
Why is he in this condition?

912
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:01,107
What happened to our son?

913
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:03,911
Why is he in this condition?

914
00:47:04,061 --> 00:47:07,193
Don't worry, Payal.
I'll handle this

915
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:08,399
Come on

916
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:09,624
Come on

917
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:15,688
You were such a soft person!

918
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,609
Who turned you into 'Arjun Reddy?'

919
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:19,439
Boss!

920
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:21,725
Three directors made 'Arjun Reddy'

921
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:23,076
Whose version are
you talking about?

922
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:25,084
Shut up! Lift him up, first!

923
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:25,750
Okay, boss!

924
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:36,414
When you called me, my mind
went numb and I became dumb

925
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:38,478
To summarize it in one line...

926
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:41,135
I feel all the happiness
in this world is mine!

927
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:43,097
Already I don't feel so fine

928
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:44,706
Then let's go out and dine!

929
00:47:44,855 --> 00:47:46,745
I had the same idea

930
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,177
'Atho' tastes really good!

931
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,482
Shall we go to Vyasarpadi,
Erukkancheri?

932
00:47:53,661 --> 00:47:54,161
No

933
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,637
Let's go somewhere towards
Pondicherry side!

934
00:47:58,396 --> 00:47:59,755
I say get on the bike already!

935
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:10,744
Venkat...

936
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,708
tell us why?

937
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:23,057
I have some skin issues.Can you
come to my room and check it out?

938
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:31,009
Listen...

939
00:48:32,224 --> 00:48:33,278
you misunderstood me

940
00:48:33,404 --> 00:48:35,177
I am doctor and you're a patient

941
00:48:35,824 --> 00:48:37,254
You said you've some problem...

942
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:38,305
and so I came here

943
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:39,567
I am committed

944
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:43,698
What you have there is a
very minor skin problem

945
00:48:44,148 --> 00:48:46,314
Apply this cream and
you'll be alright

946
00:48:46,805 --> 00:48:47,406
Okay?

947
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:49,079
Take care. Have a great day

948
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:50,900
I went there only to treat her

949
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,812
She framed me and recorded
to show it in a wrong way

950
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,015
Due to which my girlfriend
broke up with me

951
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:03,040
Come on!

952
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:04,322
Who did it? I ask who?

953
00:49:04,343 --> 00:49:05,217
An  advocate, boss

954
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:06,375
And why did he do it?

955
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:07,822
I gathered all the information

956
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:11,970
There was a small misunderstanding
between that girl and your son

957
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,033
He took advantage of that one...

958
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,073
and made that girl fall for his son

959
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:20,443
That advocate put an end to your son's
love life and twisted the story!

960
00:49:20,685 --> 00:49:21,552
How dare he?

961
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:24,138
Why didn't you tell
me this earlier? Why?

962
00:49:24,177 --> 00:49:26,684
Stop it, boss! If I had said it
earlier you'd have thrashed me!

963
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:29,342
-Either way I'll thrash you!
-That's why I didn't tell you!

964
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:32,312
I've sent my brother-in-law and
his henchmen to finish him off!

965
00:49:34,678 --> 00:49:36,116
-We must not spare his life!
-Okay, boss

966
00:49:36,178 --> 00:49:38,053
We must squash him!

967
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,071
A call for you

968
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:44,235
-It's our Lord!
-Attend it

969
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,333
-Tell me,  my Lord?
-Where are you?

970
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,724
We are stalking him!

971
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:49,560
Where is he?

972
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,161
Having a good time in a restaurant

973
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:54,692
He's chatting with a girl and
meanwhile have ordered a juice

974
00:49:54,802 --> 00:49:55,591
Where are you?

975
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:58,795
We also ordered a juice
and are monitoring him

976
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,904
But my Lord, the juice is delayed

977
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:01,833
So you didn't fight?

978
00:50:01,888 --> 00:50:03,435
How much do we fight?

979
00:50:03,732 --> 00:50:06,701
The waiter said upfront that it'll
take half an hour to serve the order

980
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,107
The boys are upset!

981
00:50:08,263 --> 00:50:10,540
Shall I put the manager on
line, would you like to talk?

982
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:13,431
Give that to me

983
00:50:13,954 --> 00:50:15,712
-I sent you to rough him up!
-What happened?

984
00:50:15,738 --> 00:50:18,050
But looks like you guys will
make my boss rough me up!

985
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:18,823
Give it to me!

986
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:22,027
Don't make me come there
and kick you all!

987
00:50:22,242 --> 00:50:23,156
Go and thrash him!

988
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:25,066
Fine! Fine!

989
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:26,961
My Lord, just a minute

990
00:50:27,015 --> 00:50:29,335
The juice we ordered is here.
I don't feel like wasting it

991
00:50:29,388 --> 00:50:30,952
Can we have it, get energized
and then beat him?

992
00:50:31,006 --> 00:50:32,749
-Son of a gun!
-Give it to me! That doofus!

993
00:50:34,162 --> 00:50:36,170
You turtle head!
What are you doing?

994
00:50:36,264 --> 00:50:38,883
Your replies are
puncturing my nose here!

995
00:50:39,031 --> 00:50:40,141
Go and hit him!

996
00:50:40,242 --> 00:50:41,515
Take it away! Come on, guys!

997
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:42,297
He's dead today!

998
00:50:42,787 --> 00:50:44,162
He's still not happy I guess

999
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:44,780
Ouch!

1000
00:50:44,948 --> 00:50:46,292
Trust me! It's true

1001
00:50:50,938 --> 00:50:52,008
Sorry, bro!

1002
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:55,371
It's okay, bro

1003
00:50:57,962 --> 00:51:01,221
He says it's okay. All
of you stamp and squash!

1004
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:32,651
They are doing it on
purpose to provoke you!

1005
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:36,284
Yet how are you are
so cool and calm?

1006
00:51:37,284 --> 00:51:38,128
Look at this...

1007
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:40,650
They were just stamping
just on the shoe

1008
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:42,501
Why must I get upset for this?

1009
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:44,501
So you don't lose
your temper at all?

1010
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:49,435
Divya!

1011
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:50,693
Divya!

1012
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:55,477
-Let go of me!
-Come on!

1013
00:51:55,748 --> 00:51:57,185
-I said, come!
-Who are you guys?

1014
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:08,595
I have been advised
not to get violent

1015
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:09,704
But then...

1016
00:52:10,181 --> 00:52:11,829
you are forcefully holding
my girlfriend's hand

1017
00:52:11,868 --> 00:52:12,431
Let go of me!

1018
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:14,757
Even if at this point
I don't fight...

1019
00:52:18,197 --> 00:52:20,518
Whoa! That's so scary! Bring it on!

1020
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:23,049
You're a piece of dumpling!
I'll eat you alive...

1021
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,908
-Run!
-Guys, escape!

1022
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,717
Time for your tuition classes.
Leave!

1023
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:36,318
How dare you raise
your hands on me?

1024
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:39,561
My team is on the way,
to put an end to your play!

1025
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:44,112
Your team, my foot!

1026
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,603
Smoothly kidnap the girl and come!

1027
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,923
Come on! Come on!

1028
00:52:56,396 --> 00:52:57,408
You heard him

1029
00:52:57,646 --> 00:52:58,287
Kidnap her

1030
00:53:00,592 --> 00:53:01,201
Come on

1031
00:53:47,952 --> 00:53:50,939
Why are you carrying
a vegetable knife?

1032
00:53:51,142 --> 00:53:52,649
-How about I cut your ear off?
-Boss! Please! No!

1033
00:53:52,728 --> 00:53:53,228
Get lost!

1034
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:56,789
Wanna kidnap her?

1035
00:53:56,853 --> 00:53:59,207
-Bro, do invite me for your wedding
-Take a hike

1036
00:54:00,441 --> 00:54:02,145
1:5 ratio!

1037
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:03,481
How is it possible?

1038
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:05,074
So and so my dear candy!

1039
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:07,673
Wow!

1040
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:09,056
Let's go!

1041
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,116
Careful boss

1042
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,601
Its that stink face!

1043
00:54:16,883 --> 00:54:18,367
Boss, it's my brother-in-law

1044
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:20,382
I guess he has got the job done

1045
00:54:20,485 --> 00:54:21,767
-Superb!
-My Lord...

1046
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:23,212
our plan failed

1047
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:24,829
That's why I told you!

1048
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:27,157
Juice would have given us the
energy! Now, look what you did?

1049
00:54:27,189 --> 00:54:27,820
You fool!

1050
00:54:28,048 --> 00:54:29,315
Aren't you ashamed?

1051
00:54:29,377 --> 00:54:30,963
Go and eat crap!

1052
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,440
Well, with what does it go?
Rice cakes or pan cakes?

1053
00:54:35,471 --> 00:54:36,134
Here!

1054
00:54:36,596 --> 00:54:38,311
-He didn't answer. He hung up
-He hung up?

1055
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:40,490
Bro, it'd be good with puffs

1056
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:41,920
-Is it?
-Indeed!

1057
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:42,490
Indeed!

1058
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:43,826
-Let try it out then
-Come on!

1059
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:44,765
Did he mess it up?

1060
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:46,232
-Yes!
-Wait, boss!

1061
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:48,417
You are hitting me for no reason

1062
00:54:48,863 --> 00:54:51,058
There is no use in hitting me

1063
00:54:51,105 --> 00:54:52,730
That's why your pressure rises!

1064
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:54,151
And all your plans stinks!

1065
00:54:54,738 --> 00:54:56,672
Calm down and
have one more drink

1066
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,984
Then take your time and
sharpen your brain for ideas

1067
00:54:59,141 --> 00:55:00,328
Then sharpen your knife

1068
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,539
I can't bear it anymore!

1069
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:06,496
Did he just played trumpet
with the booze bottle?

1070
00:55:07,442 --> 00:55:08,207
I'll follow you

1071
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,303
Boss, why have you parked the
'Wrong turn' truck over here?

1072
00:55:34,389 --> 00:55:37,124
It was only after marrying
her I became a business man

1073
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:39,473
Before that I was truck driver

1074
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,762
I have ran over many of enemies!

1075
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,285
I then pay 3000 rupees fine
and step out of the prison

1076
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:46,129
After my son was born...

1077
00:55:46,317 --> 00:55:49,682
I promised her that I will refrain
from such violent activities

1078
00:55:50,236 --> 00:55:50,736
But...

1079
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:53,361
it's time to break that promise!

1080
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:54,627
Payal!

1081
00:55:57,531 --> 00:55:58,210
Hand it to me

1082
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,469
After 25 years...

1083
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:03,057
I'm going to start this truck

1084
00:56:03,438 --> 00:56:04,150
Boss!

1085
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:07,402
You say you're going to
start the after 25 years!

1086
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:08,495
Do you think it'll start?

1087
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,050
It will start!

1088
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:11,601
-It will start!
-Get in!

1089
00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:21,173
He's gonna die!

1090
00:56:21,408 --> 00:56:22,072
It's running!

1091
00:56:23,197 --> 00:56:24,524
Where can we find
that advocate now?

1092
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:26,313
He drives a red car and
is on his way now

1093
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,086
Run that advocate over and let's
show him his game is over!

1094
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:30,039
Watch me now!

1095
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:43,492
I too love you!

1096
00:56:44,953 --> 00:56:47,102
Excuse me! I didn't
tell you anything

1097
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,157
What is that you didn't tell me?

1098
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:49,274
That I love you

1099
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,102
There! You said it now!

1100
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:58,912
Whoa! That's a whole lot of
varied emotions in your eyes!

1101
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:01,226
Didn't you hold on to my shoulder
while I was fighting?

1102
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:02,570
And I too reciprocated

1103
00:57:02,991 --> 00:57:03,811
What was all that?

1104
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,138
Weren't you concentrating
on the fight?

1105
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:09,411
When did you notice all this?

1106
00:57:09,615 --> 00:57:12,443
"When in love keep an
eye in every direction"

1107
00:57:12,645 --> 00:57:13,783
My dad told me this

1108
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,580
It's okay! Take your own time

1109
00:57:15,722 --> 00:57:16,556
I am single

1110
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:19,510
Anyone who's ready to date me?
Anyone?

1111
00:57:19,627 --> 00:57:21,440
Anyone empty inside? Anyone?

1112
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:22,991
I am empty inside! How about me?

1113
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:24,126
Looks like you didn't bathe today

1114
00:57:24,163 --> 00:57:24,821
Jeyaraj!

1115
00:57:26,187 --> 00:57:28,476
Well, my dad also said
the same thing to me

1116
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,278
I...

1117
00:57:33,068 --> 00:57:33,841
I love you!

1118
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:35,828
Then hug me!

1119
00:57:54,307 --> 00:57:56,041
My Lord, take right!

1120
00:57:56,151 --> 00:57:56,713
Why?

1121
00:57:56,737 --> 00:57:58,955
That's the car number! My
brother-in-law informed me

1122
00:57:59,071 --> 00:58:00,992
-That car?
-Yes boss! The red car!

1123
00:58:01,016 --> 00:58:02,070
Don't let him escape! Follow him!

1124
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:07,117
The drink in my hand vibrates
when I take it to my mouth

1125
00:58:10,244 --> 00:58:11,798
-My Lord!
-What is it?

1126
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:13,713
-Slow down a bit
-Why?

1127
00:58:14,049 --> 00:58:15,236
The booze is spilling all over

1128
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:19,025
We are on our way to murder someone and
you think booze is more important?

1129
00:58:25,156 --> 00:58:26,202
The car's missing!

1130
00:58:26,228 --> 00:58:29,413
Right! Do you think he's your
wife to keep you informed?

1131
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:31,608
How'd I know? Drive fast!

1132
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:34,386
First, I'll finish him
off then you're next!

1133
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,410
Tell me!

1134
00:58:40,543 --> 00:58:41,985
Where is our 'Devadas?'

1135
00:58:42,046 --> 00:58:42,824
Come again? 'Devadas?'

1136
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:43,628
Then?

1137
00:58:43,785 --> 00:58:48,121
Bro's love worked out. He's out
with his girlfriend at ECR

1138
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:49,176
His love worked out?

1139
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,192
Now stop acting like actor Nagesh,
as if you don't know what you did

1140
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:52,989
What did I do?

1141
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:54,067
Forget it

1142
00:58:54,223 --> 00:58:55,582
I won't ask you to throw a party

1143
00:58:55,637 --> 00:58:56,626
Oh, come on!

1144
00:58:57,556 --> 00:59:00,820
For giving me this good news, I shall
buy you booze from Pondicherry

1145
00:59:00,883 --> 00:59:01,704
Awesome!

1146
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:04,930
Okay darling, I'll
talk to you later

1147
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,704
You are gonna die today!

1148
00:59:06,946 --> 00:59:08,173
Why are you hanging the
cover on the horn?

1149
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:28,495
When did we reach
Kodaikanal hill station?

1150
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:31,228
Oh my God! What did you do, boss?

1151
00:59:31,603 --> 00:59:35,134
The truck in posing like a dog
during the winter season!

1152
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:39,967
Get lost!

1153
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:43,123
Who is that performing
wheeling stunts with a truck?

1154
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:47,745
Hello

1155
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:48,585
Oh my God!

1156
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:49,817
Boss!

1157
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:51,288
He's calling the cops

1158
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:53,671
We are doomed! Let's
jump and escape!

1159
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:56,655
Take it! Take it!

1160
00:59:56,788 --> 01:00:00,091
Did you leave your brain at home?

1161
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:01,755
In such a situation...

1162
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,255
you want me to take the call?

1163
01:00:03,302 --> 01:00:04,481
Break that phone!

1164
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,123
I meant my leg is stuck!
Help me take it out!

1165
01:00:07,372 --> 01:00:10,097
Your leg is stuck? Now, hold your
breath and pull it with full force!

1166
01:00:10,237 --> 01:00:13,159
Quick! Jump or else the
cops will catch us

1167
01:00:19,072 --> 01:00:19,572
Sir...

1168
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,408
you called up the hospital and
arranged for an ambulance

1169
01:00:22,697 --> 01:00:25,314
You are a saviour!

1170
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:26,146
Thanks a lot!

1171
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:28,325
-Come on, I must thank you
-Why sir?

1172
01:00:28,403 --> 01:00:30,176
The minute you realized
the truck's brake failed...

1173
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:32,786
you honked and saved my life!

1174
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:36,083
Sir, do you need any money
for your treatment?

1175
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:41,606
For emergency purpose transfer some
money through Google pay to my number

1176
01:00:41,677 --> 01:00:42,997
Okay. Careful!

1177
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,067
Take them carefully

1178
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,485
Okay

1179
01:01:00,036 --> 01:01:00,762
Bye

1180
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:01,612
Bye

1181
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,168
How did you get here?

1182
01:01:41,357 --> 01:01:42,607
Ask why I am here?

1183
01:01:43,377 --> 01:01:45,919
That look you gave me
when you left me...

1184
01:01:46,044 --> 01:01:47,075
Whoa!

1185
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:49,432
Jeyaraj was minding his business...

1186
01:01:49,494 --> 01:01:52,073
but that look kicked in a nostalgia like
a Jackie Chan movie from my childhood

1187
01:01:52,094 --> 01:01:53,781
Immediately I
climbed the wall...

1188
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:54,641
and came to you!

1189
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:56,316
Just that look brought you here?

1190
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,385
That wasn't a normal look you gave

1191
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:01,163
Even 10 pegs of booze won't
get guys like me sloshed

1192
01:02:01,335 --> 01:02:04,866
But a look from a girl
friend and look how I fall!

1193
01:02:05,452 --> 01:02:08,147
Fine! My mom might return from
shopping any minute now. Leave!

1194
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:11,491
Well my body is aching
from all the climbing

1195
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:13,600
If you can give me
a light massage...

1196
01:02:13,845 --> 01:02:15,094
-then I shall leave
-Massage?

1197
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,687
Leave at once! Leave!

1198
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:23,591
Jeyaraj!

1199
01:02:23,805 --> 01:02:25,076
Tell me Prakash Raj!

1200
01:02:25,169 --> 01:02:27,513
Looks like best days of
your lives are back again

1201
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:29,357
Well you kick started it!

1202
01:02:29,443 --> 01:02:30,435
What did I do?

1203
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:31,295
Modesty?

1204
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:33,342
Fine, I am busy.
I'll call you later

1205
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:34,468
Sorry! Sorry!

1206
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:36,594
Where are you? Movies or park?

1207
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,203
My girlfriend's home

1208
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,914
Do not cross the limit
before marriage

1209
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,990
Don't you cross your limit either

1210
01:02:43,178 --> 01:02:45,646
Give space and you'll
reach for the face!

1211
01:02:45,676 --> 01:02:46,723
Well, dear...

1212
01:02:49,419 --> 01:02:51,777
Not even a courtesy bye
before hanging up the call!

1213
01:02:53,574 --> 01:02:54,824
Well, he must be having fun

1214
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,099
Who was that?

1215
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:01,049
My dad

1216
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:03,577
Mom!

1217
01:03:03,924 --> 01:03:05,128
Not mom! It was my dad

1218
01:03:05,503 --> 01:03:06,683
My mom has arrived!

1219
01:03:08,428 --> 01:03:10,123
What do we do? Hide! Hide!

1220
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:11,342
Am I visible?

1221
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,331
-Am I visible?
-Not here!

1222
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:13,796
-Over there!
-Wait, I'll go!

1223
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:18,087
Welcome advocate, sir! You
promised you'd be coming yesterday!

1224
01:03:18,658 --> 01:03:20,384
Had an important case
to attend, madam

1225
01:03:20,456 --> 01:03:21,161
I couldn't come

1226
01:03:21,425 --> 01:03:22,589
Nobody's home?

1227
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:23,724
Divya is there at home

1228
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:27,580
What do I do? I'm confused!

1229
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:32,171
Come in

1230
01:03:33,512 --> 01:03:34,512
What were you up to?

1231
01:03:34,919 --> 01:03:36,328
Rang the bell many times!

1232
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,253
I was listening to songs

1233
01:03:38,453 --> 01:03:39,695
I didn't hear the bell, mom

1234
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:41,679
Give him some water first

1235
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:42,608
Okay

1236
01:03:42,992 --> 01:03:43,761
Please come

1237
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:53,118
Like you wanted, I broke up Divya's
relationship with that guy

1238
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:58,928
Happy?

1239
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,733
Does your duty stop there?

1240
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:06,932
I am talking to you!
Where are you off to?

1241
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,154
We haven't paid the EB bill yet!

1242
01:04:09,186 --> 01:04:10,822
AC is under repair for a month now

1243
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:12,985
I've been telling you that
we need to replace it!

1244
01:04:13,095 --> 01:04:15,768
Where is the tee shirt
with the cat's portrait?

1245
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:17,440
A cat stole it

1246
01:04:17,525 --> 01:04:18,362
A cat stole...

1247
01:04:18,579 --> 01:04:20,587
You keep working all the time
and don't come home at all

1248
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,417
When you are here, you don't
pay heed to me at all?

1249
01:04:23,566 --> 01:04:25,253
I handle everything here.
Do you know my struggle?

1250
01:04:25,288 --> 01:04:26,944
Fine! Don't you get upset

1251
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:28,903
Do you think I am
happily roaming around?

1252
01:04:28,928 --> 01:04:32,366
Earnings from Poonamalle court cases
alone won't be enough to run this family

1253
01:04:32,684 --> 01:04:33,498
Understand?

1254
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:37,309
I can earn more only if I take cases
from Chengalpattu and high court too

1255
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:40,691
Who toils hard for this family?
Answer me!

1256
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:42,907
Divya, hand it
properly to your dad!

1257
01:04:43,328 --> 01:04:44,219
Sorry, dad!

1258
01:04:44,419 --> 01:04:45,966
Fine, you are correct!

1259
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:48,804
But that doesn't mean you
must be an workaholic!

1260
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,240
I am home, right?

1261
01:04:51,494 --> 01:04:53,158
Now I guarantee you
full entertainment!

1262
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,856
Hey! Hey you!

1263
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:58,333
What are you doing there?

1264
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,942
A pipe is under repair.
I'm checking it

1265
01:04:59,973 --> 01:05:01,872
-Careful, don't break the pipe
-Okay!

1266
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:21,857
Where are you?

1267
01:05:21,897 --> 01:05:23,421
I reached my hood!

1268
01:05:24,959 --> 01:05:25,826
Thank God!

1269
01:05:26,037 --> 01:05:27,887
Imagine if my dad had caught us!

1270
01:05:28,128 --> 01:05:29,706
We'd have landed at
the climax scene

1271
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,301
Don't you know no fear?

1272
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:32,980
Are you that afraid of your dad?

1273
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,777
Aren't you afraid of your dad?

1274
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,111
No way! In fact he's
the one afraid of me

1275
01:05:37,376 --> 01:05:39,368
How can you talk so ill of him?

1276
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,626
A mother keeps pointing out the fact
that she carried us in her womb

1277
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:43,493
But...

1278
01:05:44,181 --> 01:05:46,258
a father, who carries all
our burdens for life...

1279
01:05:46,328 --> 01:05:48,578
will never expect an approval
from us for his sacrifice!

1280
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,922
But not my dad!

1281
01:05:50,953 --> 01:05:53,422
He's too bad! He keeps pointing
out his sacrifices often!

1282
01:05:53,726 --> 01:05:57,406
I don't know how you
treated him before

1283
01:05:57,508 --> 01:05:59,669
But you must treat him
with respect hereafter

1284
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:02,192
Because he's not
just your father...

1285
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:03,918
but a father to me too

1286
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:10,150
Divya! What are you
doing over there?

1287
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,541
Fetch some water for your dad

1288
01:06:12,526 --> 01:06:14,049
Fine. I'll call you later

1289
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:18,192
Dad...

1290
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,842
-"Spat at governor's office"
-Boring!

1291
01:06:30,912 --> 01:06:33,974
"Selvi from Ambattur,
Chennai..."

1292
01:06:34,037 --> 01:06:37,154
"in order to link her husband's
Aadhar card with ration card..."

1293
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,091
"had been to the Governor's office"

1294
01:06:39,174 --> 01:06:43,942
"But his Aadhar card was already
linked to another ration card"

1295
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,145
"This sparked up a confusion"

1296
01:06:45,225 --> 01:06:48,499
"Later when that woman's
husband was investigated..."

1297
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:52,015
"it was revealed that he was
already married to another woman"

1298
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:53,674
"This led to a spat"

1299
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:57,323
"The cops spoke to both his
wife and reached a compromise"

1300
01:06:57,323 --> 01:07:00,245
-How dare you? Hit him!
-You mongrel! How dare you!

1301
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,842
-Hit him! Hit him!
-Stop! It hurts!

1302
01:07:03,006 --> 01:07:05,404
"Whether report, Chennai 29..."

1303
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:07,904
Aren't you done eating yet?

1304
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:09,185
Come, let's go

1305
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:10,765
To where?

1306
01:07:11,342 --> 01:07:13,084
I have been telling for long now!

1307
01:07:13,186 --> 01:07:15,264
We got to link the ration
card with Aadhar ID

1308
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:17,431
Ration card and Aadhar card?

1309
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:19,657
-Then it'll be a mess up
-What will be a mess up?

1310
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:21,083
My living!

1311
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,493
Stop this foolishness
and come, let's go

1312
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:24,974
No way! I have lot of work

1313
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:26,958
Look, I'm getting a call already

1314
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:29,059
-Hello
-Boss...

1315
01:07:29,247 --> 01:07:31,520
Our organization has
declared holidays for us

1316
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:32,161
Shall I arrange booze?

1317
01:07:32,224 --> 01:07:35,201
What? All the pending cases
must be cleared within a week?

1318
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:37,646
I said they have declared holiday!
I'm saying you don't even have to come

1319
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,170
What?

1320
01:07:39,232 --> 01:07:40,912
Have fun at home, boss.
You don't have to work

1321
01:07:40,982 --> 01:07:42,724
What? I should come there at once?

1322
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:44,184
Is there any problem with the network?

1323
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:45,365
Boss, can you hear me?

1324
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:48,435
There's a court hearing at 12 'O
clock? Why didn't inform me earlier?

1325
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:49,907
You egg head! Come here

1326
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,367
Whom are you calling an egg head?

1327
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:52,688
-You heard me?
-Yes!

1328
01:07:52,845 --> 01:07:53,775
-Leave!
-Get lost!

1329
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,431
He can hear me clearly
then what's his problem?

1330
01:07:57,689 --> 01:08:00,978
So when will you link you
Aadhar card with ration card?

1331
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:03,320
Link them up and we'll be
separated. Are you okay with that?

1332
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:05,157
-I didn't get you!
-So be it!

1333
01:08:05,938 --> 01:08:06,694
Dear!

1334
01:08:11,864 --> 01:08:12,642
Ramani...

1335
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:14,801
-get me some water
-Coming

1336
01:08:22,326 --> 01:08:23,849
This is new!

1337
01:08:24,482 --> 01:08:27,201
Dad, my girlfriend
taught me something

1338
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:31,346
A mother keeps pointing out the fact
that she carried us in her womb

1339
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:33,542
But a father, who carries all
our burdens for life...

1340
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:35,785
will never expect an approval
from us for his sacrifice!

1341
01:08:35,854 --> 01:08:38,112
That melted my heart and changed me

1342
01:08:38,228 --> 01:08:40,509
My foot! When have I
ever pointed that out?

1343
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,706
You hardly know her for a day...

1344
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:46,087
and she already wants to
separate mother and son?

1345
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:48,532
Is this why I carried
you in my womb?

1346
01:08:48,595 --> 01:08:51,634
There! You pointed it out!
My girlfriend was right

1347
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:55,630
Jeyaraj, you already taking your
wife's side even before marriage?

1348
01:08:55,786 --> 01:08:57,645
She has to come,
live here after the marriage

1349
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:58,637
I'll deal her then!

1350
01:08:58,809 --> 01:09:00,933
-Mom, don't get upset...
-Get lost!

1351
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,605
Forget her. She is getting jealous

1352
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:03,335
My king...

1353
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:06,606
That girl has brought a change
in my son within a day!

1354
01:09:06,837 --> 01:09:08,532
Your mother doesn't
realize it's worth!

1355
01:09:09,805 --> 01:09:11,907
Your girlfriend isn't just
my daughter-in-law...

1356
01:09:12,454 --> 01:09:13,482
but like a daughter to me

1357
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,296
Dad! Careful!

1358
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,608
Shall I apply some pain balm?

1359
01:09:17,003 --> 01:09:18,350
How about I apply pigeon's crap?

1360
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,577
Or shall I pour some boiling
hot water on your leg?

1361
01:09:20,694 --> 01:09:21,991
How about a drink?

1362
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,680
Where is your girlfriend?

1363
01:09:37,853 --> 01:09:40,588
Informed her. Your
daughter-in-law is on her way

1364
01:09:41,103 --> 01:09:42,119
Sorry, daughter!

1365
01:09:42,703 --> 01:09:44,267
Do you something
with thicker border?

1366
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:46,947
How about the one
at Pakistan border?

1367
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:48,557
Just joking, Ramani!

1368
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:51,861
Are you laughing for the joke?

1369
01:09:51,907 --> 01:09:54,189
Or are you laughing at the joke?

1370
01:09:57,556 --> 01:09:58,915
Sir, your son?

1371
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:01,994
Do I look like his daughter?
Of course I'm his son!

1372
01:10:03,506 --> 01:10:04,676
Laughs for this one too!

1373
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:08,578
Dad, he laughs at everything.
Let's take him with us

1374
01:10:08,632 --> 01:10:10,340
Jeyaraj, leave him alone.
You carry on

1375
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,304
I said, leave

1376
01:10:11,648 --> 01:10:13,109
Guess she has arrived

1377
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:14,184
Dear...

1378
01:10:14,562 --> 01:10:15,622
my phone is ringing

1379
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,883
Mom, did you select?

1380
01:10:22,309 --> 01:10:23,137
This one's good, honey

1381
01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:24,309
I'll be back in two minutes

1382
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:27,504
Look this blue one is also good

1383
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:32,576
-Hello
-Where are you?

1384
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,404
I'm at the court. Call me later

1385
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,537
Hold on. Just a minute

1386
01:10:35,662 --> 01:10:37,185
We both are out for shopping

1387
01:10:37,342 --> 01:10:39,482
If you reach home, you'll find
the key under the door mat

1388
01:10:39,576 --> 01:10:40,802
I called up to tell you that

1389
01:10:40,912 --> 01:10:41,944
Okay. Okay

1390
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:44,014
Hello? Where are you shopping?

1391
01:10:44,045 --> 01:10:45,826
-Hello! Hello!
-Excuse me, ma'am. Your bag please

1392
01:10:47,883 --> 01:10:50,211
Mom, you carry on. I'll catch up

1393
01:10:53,677 --> 01:10:54,582
These guys I tell you!

1394
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:11,172
What's with the hide and
seek Mr. Lover boy?

1395
01:11:13,594 --> 01:11:14,788
Something's fishy!

1396
01:11:16,374 --> 01:11:17,702
Take him with you. I'll catch up

1397
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:19,265
Keep walking

1398
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,147
I want two silk sarees
and two cotton sarees

1399
01:11:23,194 --> 01:11:23,976
That's the section

1400
01:11:40,678 --> 01:11:41,367
Mom...

1401
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:42,716
Come, dear!

1402
01:11:42,742 --> 01:11:43,661
-Hi aunty
-Divya

1403
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:46,231
God bless you!

1404
01:11:46,653 --> 01:11:47,520
Where's dad?

1405
01:11:47,677 --> 01:11:48,614
Wasn't he with you?

1406
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:51,160
He was right behind me but
all of a sudden went missing

1407
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:54,107
He was so eager to meet you

1408
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:56,357
You guys carry on.
I'll go look for him

1409
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,411
Let's check out sarees

1410
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:58,755
This looks nice, isn't it?

1411
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:00,728
How about this one?

1412
01:12:02,964 --> 01:12:05,059
Why don't you try churidhar, aunty?

1413
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,113
It won't suit me, dear

1414
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:10,129
-Just give it a shot
-No, dear

1415
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,473
Come on! Please! Pretty please

1416
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:40,387
Whose blessing are you expecting
to get by crawling like this?

1417
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:43,796
Well Jeyaraj, I lost a five rupee
coin. I was looking for it

1418
01:12:43,866 --> 01:12:45,991
My girlfriend is waiting
for you over there...

1419
01:12:46,038 --> 01:12:47,911
and you wanna look
for lost five rupee?

1420
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:48,693
Come on, dad!

1421
01:12:49,596 --> 01:12:50,096
Thank God!

1422
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:51,386
Mom...

1423
01:12:51,518 --> 01:12:53,261
She says she wants to leave

1424
01:12:53,557 --> 01:12:54,752
Where are you and your dad?

1425
01:12:54,877 --> 01:12:57,562
I found him. He was looking
for some lost change

1426
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:01,486
Excuse me

1427
01:13:01,718 --> 01:13:04,250
-Did you see a rascal crawling here?
-No, I didn't

1428
01:13:05,072 --> 01:13:06,096
Wait, mom. I'll come

1429
01:13:09,558 --> 01:13:10,550
Try it out, aunty

1430
01:13:10,588 --> 01:13:12,533
-Please don't compel me
-Please aunty

1431
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:27,135
You said you were at the court!
What are you doing here?

1432
01:13:27,245 --> 01:13:28,854
Came here to buy you some dresses

1433
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:30,565
Buy me dresses but why?

1434
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:32,008
Isn't it our anniversary today?

1435
01:13:33,343 --> 01:13:34,038
No, it's not

1436
01:13:34,592 --> 01:13:36,632
Well, should I buy you
dress only on occasions?

1437
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:37,999
Why can't it be a surprise?

1438
01:13:38,116 --> 01:13:39,537
Why do you wanna surprise me now?

1439
01:13:39,647 --> 01:13:41,194
I tell you then it
won't be a surprise

1440
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,330
Here!

1441
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:43,959
Try this

1442
01:13:44,099 --> 01:13:45,883
There are many choices.
Let me check them...

1443
01:13:45,898 --> 01:13:48,193
No! You'll look beautiful
like a heroine in this one!

1444
01:13:48,248 --> 01:13:50,226
-Is it?
-I swear. Try it

1445
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,116
-Go
-I'll try it

1446
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:53,241
Phew!

1447
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:00,849
Dad!

1448
01:14:02,907 --> 01:14:04,766
I didn't expect you'd come here

1449
01:14:05,103 --> 01:14:07,087
Well I too didn't expect
you guys will come here

1450
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,009
-Where's mom?
-In the trial room

1451
01:14:09,259 --> 01:14:11,368
You also take this churidhar...

1452
01:14:11,525 --> 01:14:13,009
-and give it a try
-Dad!

1453
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:15,056
I'm not here for churidhar

1454
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:15,757
Then?

1455
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:17,220
Are you here for my life?

1456
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:18,736
Why are you getting upset, dad?

1457
01:14:18,783 --> 01:14:21,130
I'm not getting upset.
I was just kidding

1458
01:14:22,942 --> 01:14:24,762
-Bloody Bhaskar!
-Sir, your daughter?

1459
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:27,630
Do I look like his son?

1460
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:28,686
Of course I'm his daughter

1461
01:14:29,802 --> 01:14:30,516
Sir...

1462
01:14:30,685 --> 01:14:32,185
she talks exactly like your son

1463
01:14:32,387 --> 01:14:34,379
Stop creating a confusion!
You carry on

1464
01:14:34,505 --> 01:14:37,240
-Server the juice with spit for that black shirt guy
-Okay! Okay!

1465
01:14:37,522 --> 01:14:39,850
What are you waiting for?
Go, try it!

1466
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:41,303
Come on, dear!

1467
01:14:43,928 --> 01:14:44,553
Dear!

1468
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,287
How is it?

1469
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:48,678
Gave me a heart attack!

1470
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:50,201
Not good?

1471
01:14:50,264 --> 01:14:51,835
Looks like you're wearing a grinder cover

1472
01:14:51,866 --> 01:14:52,843
Shall I try another one?

1473
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:54,453
Please do that

1474
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,484
-I'll try another one
-Please, do that

1475
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:01,587
Thank God!

1476
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:03,619
Dear!

1477
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:05,759
How is it?

1478
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:06,893
I'm exhausted

1479
01:15:07,465 --> 01:15:08,652
I can't handle it anymore

1480
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:10,902
What are you blabbing? I'm
talking about the churidhar

1481
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,359
No! This looks good.
You go and get it billed

1482
01:15:14,138 --> 01:15:15,682
Choose another one

1483
01:15:17,004 --> 01:15:17,589
Fine, wait

1484
01:15:22,428 --> 01:15:23,230
Raj!

1485
01:15:23,888 --> 01:15:24,899
Bro!

1486
01:15:24,932 --> 01:15:26,466
Your sister is calling you

1487
01:15:27,574 --> 01:15:28,254
My sister?

1488
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:29,342
Who is my sister?

1489
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,967
The girl approaching us

1490
01:15:32,805 --> 01:15:34,506
I'll break your jaw
and melt your face!

1491
01:15:34,538 --> 01:15:35,977
-Why?
-Who said she is my sister?

1492
01:15:36,092 --> 01:15:36,928
She's my girlfriend

1493
01:15:36,983 --> 01:15:37,858
What?

1494
01:15:38,136 --> 01:15:38,972
Your girlfriend?

1495
01:15:41,144 --> 01:15:43,254
Yes! We're getting
married next month

1496
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:45,449
Both of you are getting married?

1497
01:15:45,644 --> 01:15:47,714
-Before that I'm going commit a murder
-Why are you laughing?

1498
01:15:47,799 --> 01:15:50,049
On top of that you're
going to murder? Whom?

1499
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:50,987
You!

1500
01:15:51,073 --> 01:15:54,003
Mind your business, serve juice
and wash the used juice glasses!

1501
01:15:54,026 --> 01:15:55,479
Don't poke your nose
in our business

1502
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:57,234
Leave him! Let's go. Let's go

1503
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:58,285
Come with me

1504
01:15:58,898 --> 01:15:59,969
Crazy fellow

1505
01:16:00,898 --> 01:16:03,125
-Sir! Sir! Just a minute!
-Hands off me!

1506
01:16:03,187 --> 01:16:03,944
-What?
-Sir...

1507
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:06,080
-Please clear my doubt
-What is it?

1508
01:16:06,314 --> 01:16:08,338
Was that your son in saree section?

1509
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,040
Yes!

1510
01:16:09,205 --> 01:16:11,322
Was that your daughter
here in churidhar section?

1511
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:13,017
-Yes!
-God!

1512
01:16:13,088 --> 01:16:15,494
-Sir, both of them...
-Dear!

1513
01:16:16,734 --> 01:16:17,901
How is it?

1514
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:28,395
Sir!

1515
01:16:38,504 --> 01:16:40,660
Mom, look at you!

1516
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:43,566
Daughter-in-law just turned
you into Madonna Sebastian!

1517
01:16:43,762 --> 01:16:45,880
Thanks to my daughter-in-law.
How is it?

1518
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:48,236
Super! Hereafter I'll tell
people that you're my sister

1519
01:16:48,392 --> 01:16:49,611
Shut up! Where's dad?

1520
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:50,838
Didn't he come with you?

1521
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,931
He was here but all of
a sudden went missing

1522
01:16:53,384 --> 01:16:56,140
-Check where is he
-Where does he go?

1523
01:16:56,302 --> 01:16:57,138
Nice!

1524
01:16:57,435 --> 01:16:58,169
-Hello
-Thank you

1525
01:16:58,536 --> 01:17:00,989
Myself, my girlfriend and
mom are waiting here

1526
01:17:01,035 --> 01:17:02,482
What are you doing? Where are you?

1527
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:06,880
Fine. Fine, okay

1528
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:09,278
-What happened?
-His senior lawyer had a heart attack

1529
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,450
He left as it was an emergency.
He said he'll meet you later

1530
01:17:11,536 --> 01:17:12,887
-Fine, come let's leave
-Shall we?

1531
01:17:13,497 --> 01:17:13,997
Okay

1532
01:17:14,746 --> 01:17:16,584
The squeezer seems faulty

1533
01:17:17,317 --> 01:17:18,599
-Better to squeeze with hands
-Hello, sir

1534
01:17:18,864 --> 01:17:20,138
We have been waiting for you.
Welcome

1535
01:17:20,176 --> 01:17:20,676
Sir...

1536
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,762
what made you choose our hospital as
soon as you met with the accident?

1537
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:25,972
Well, truth be told madam...

1538
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:28,714
We heard you dress up really
well, I mean, the wounds

1539
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:29,824
We wanted to see that

1540
01:17:29,869 --> 01:17:30,768
When will you do it?

1541
01:17:31,002 --> 01:17:32,987
-Please talk sensibly
-Right! Same to you!

1542
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:36,587
Instead of treating, then
smuggling the patient's organs...

1543
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,743
and finally dispose of
the patient's corpse...

1544
01:17:38,758 --> 01:17:40,556
why are you asking why
and how we reached here?

1545
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:41,102
God!

1546
01:17:41,134 --> 01:17:43,173
Guess that's why
your jaw is hurt!

1547
01:17:47,858 --> 01:17:49,280
Stop! Stop!

1548
01:17:49,358 --> 01:17:50,381
Meet the senior officer

1549
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,061
Where are you coming from?

1550
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:52,685
Mahabs

1551
01:17:53,405 --> 01:17:54,335
Mahabalipuram, sir

1552
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:55,663
What did you tell at home?

1553
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:56,397
"See you"

1554
01:17:57,053 --> 01:17:58,554
I swear that's what I
said when I left home

1555
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,569
What did you tell at home?

1556
01:17:59,687 --> 01:18:01,679
I stepped out saying I'm
going to my friend's home

1557
01:18:01,733 --> 01:18:03,085
So you lied, isn't it?

1558
01:18:03,466 --> 01:18:03,966
Now blow

1559
01:18:04,022 --> 01:18:06,553
Everyone keeps asking me
to blow up. Am I so thin?

1560
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:08,069
I said blow air!

1561
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:10,581
You blow

1562
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,191
Sir!

1563
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:13,104
Asking a girl to blow
doesn't sound right

1564
01:18:13,174 --> 01:18:16,026
Of late girls are
drinking more than guys!

1565
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:16,870
-You blow
-Sir!

1566
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:19,473
According to rules only the
traffic police can stop a vehicle

1567
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,907
Are you from law and
order or crime branch?

1568
01:18:20,949 --> 01:18:23,251
Do you know who I am?
A Youtube celebrity

1569
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:24,528
Parris Jeyaraj!

1570
01:18:24,637 --> 01:18:26,551
-If I record this and post it...
-Excuse me

1571
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,892
Please don't get upset

1572
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:31,650
There are lot of illegal
activities happening in ECR route

1573
01:18:31,805 --> 01:18:34,619
Girls and guys drink and
are creating issues

1574
01:18:34,697 --> 01:18:36,470
We've orders from the commissioner

1575
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:37,353
Hence...

1576
01:18:37,455 --> 01:18:39,627
Get lost! Can't you make
it out from their faces?

1577
01:18:39,736 --> 01:18:40,728
Can't even judge people!

1578
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:42,454
Now that's the real police!
Awesome, sir

1579
01:18:43,017 --> 01:18:44,541
Just a minute. Get down

1580
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:45,455
Get down

1581
01:18:46,486 --> 01:18:47,080
Get down

1582
01:18:49,072 --> 01:18:50,673
I apologize on his behalf

1583
01:18:51,072 --> 01:18:52,494
Do have your dad's phone number?

1584
01:18:53,486 --> 01:18:54,220
What do I do now?

1585
01:18:54,306 --> 01:18:57,418
I won't tell on you. Just call him.
This is just a mere formality

1586
01:18:58,454 --> 01:19:00,079
You heard him. It's
just a formality

1587
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:02,618
Your dad has to know about
us one day. Don't worry

1588
01:19:07,683 --> 01:19:08,473
Tell me, Divya

1589
01:19:08,934 --> 01:19:11,239
Dad I am in love with a guy

1590
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,059
You're in love?

1591
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:14,731
I came to ECR with him

1592
01:19:15,138 --> 01:19:16,325
The police stopped us

1593
01:19:16,388 --> 01:19:18,685
How dare he? Did you mention
my name? Put him on line

1594
01:19:18,763 --> 01:19:20,474
Dad, there is no issue

1595
01:19:20,724 --> 01:19:23,555
He said that it's just a formality.
He wants to talk to you

1596
01:19:23,712 --> 01:19:24,805
Put him online

1597
01:19:28,273 --> 01:19:28,945
Hello

1598
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:31,660
Greetings, officer. I
am advocate Prakash Raj

1599
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:34,027
Your daughter didn't tell
me you are an advocate

1600
01:19:34,121 --> 01:19:35,550
Well, I told you now, right?

1601
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:37,151
Which police station?

1602
01:19:37,324 --> 01:19:38,394
I'm from Neelankarai

1603
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:40,959
Neelankarai? Well the
J-8 police station

1604
01:19:41,116 --> 01:19:43,553
Crime AC Jagadeesh over there
is a good friend of mine

1605
01:19:43,577 --> 01:19:45,225
Awesome! Superb!

1606
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:49,226
Still I'd advice you to keep yourself
informed about where your daughter goes

1607
01:19:49,506 --> 01:19:53,201
Because snatching, robbery
and rapes are on the rise

1608
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,867
I only mean your welfare

1609
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:55,810
I understand, sir

1610
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:58,855
My bad, I should have been a little
more strict with my daughter

1611
01:20:00,058 --> 01:20:01,488
How does the guy with her look?

1612
01:20:04,898 --> 01:20:06,098
He looks like a rascal

1613
01:20:06,129 --> 01:20:07,527
-A small help
-Tell me

1614
01:20:07,606 --> 01:20:10,035
Detain him and just
let my daughter go

1615
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,239
I'll come to the station in the morning

1616
01:20:11,309 --> 01:20:13,856
Whatever is the formalities,
that shall be done sir

1617
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:16,811
Fine. Okay. Just a minute

1618
01:20:17,975 --> 01:20:18,623
Here

1619
01:20:20,952 --> 01:20:21,811
I spoke to him

1620
01:20:21,944 --> 01:20:23,988
What you're doing in the
name of love is wrong!

1621
01:20:24,043 --> 01:20:25,691
Book a cab and reach home at once!

1622
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:28,222
-We'll discuss this in the morning
-Okay, dad

1623
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,472
What happened?

1624
01:20:30,277 --> 01:20:31,636
-What happened?
-Done talking?

1625
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,931
-Marimuthu
-Sir?

1626
01:20:34,189 --> 01:20:36,455
-Book a cab and send this girl home
-Okay, sir

1627
01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:38,627
Why are you sending her alone, sir?

1628
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:39,970
I'll tell you. You leave

1629
01:20:40,524 --> 01:20:41,710
Fine. You carry on

1630
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,483
Don't worry. It's a piece of cake

1631
01:20:45,562 --> 01:20:48,187
-He doesn't realize who I am
-You get in the jeep

1632
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,529
-You don't know who my father is
-Who is he?

1633
01:20:50,773 --> 01:20:51,476
Wait

1634
01:20:57,075 --> 01:20:57,997
What is it Jeyaraj?

1635
01:20:58,105 --> 01:20:59,816
Dad, the police caught me

1636
01:20:59,846 --> 01:21:00,456
You too?

1637
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:02,394
Me too? Whom else do you
know who got caught?

1638
01:21:03,261 --> 01:21:04,796
Forget it. Put the officer online

1639
01:21:05,269 --> 01:21:06,658
My dad is on the phone

1640
01:21:08,253 --> 01:21:09,948
Hello, inspector speaking

1641
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:11,370
Why have you arrested my son?

1642
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,254
He was roaming around with a girl.
What else do you expect?

1643
01:21:14,316 --> 01:21:16,543
-That's his girlfriend
-His girlfriend?

1644
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:20,058
You say she's his girlfriend but her
dad wants me to arrest your son

1645
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,277
Who the hell does he think he is,
to order you to arrest my son?

1646
01:21:23,303 --> 01:21:24,190
Which station?

1647
01:21:24,305 --> 01:21:25,126
Neelankarai

1648
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:27,259
Neelankarai? Well the
J-8 police station

1649
01:21:27,727 --> 01:21:30,337
Crime AC Jagadeesan over there
is a good friend of mine

1650
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:32,948
Jagadeesan...Sir what's your name?

1651
01:21:33,026 --> 01:21:34,136
Advocate Prakash Raj!

1652
01:21:34,174 --> 01:21:34,674
You!

1653
01:21:37,401 --> 01:21:37,916
Hello

1654
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,125
Aren't you the same guy who spoke
to me as that's girl's father?

1655
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:41,164
Which girl, sir?

1656
01:21:41,242 --> 01:21:41,898
Look here!

1657
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:46,703
These love birds set up someone to
play their dad when police catch them

1658
01:21:46,844 --> 01:21:50,081
I'll break your knees if I
catch hold of you! Hang up!

1659
01:21:52,432 --> 01:21:53,362
Love birds?

1660
01:21:54,964 --> 01:21:56,143
Where is that girl?

1661
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:57,965
Sir, I just saw her off

1662
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,761
You come to the station. Let's
see who turns up to bail you

1663
01:22:00,824 --> 01:22:02,058
I'm a Youtube celebrity, sir

1664
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,984
 Why is dad asking for
my boyfriend's photo?

1665
01:22:24,683 --> 01:22:25,766
Sir! Sir!

1666
01:22:30,169 --> 01:22:31,237
Maghi...

1667
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:34,511
These two birdies have been
showing off around too much, dude

1668
01:22:34,878 --> 01:22:38,245
I have been eying them! Watch
me woo one of them soon!

1669
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:40,788
-Bro
-Hey bro

1670
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:41,584
What's up?

1671
01:22:41,798 --> 01:22:43,733
 -Two packets
-Money please!

1672
01:22:50,943 --> 01:22:52,983
-Yes, tell me!
-Where are you?

1673
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:55,381
-At my regular hang out spot
-Yeah! I saw you!

1674
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,040
Come on, been so
long since I met you

1675
01:23:00,185 --> 01:23:01,428
Uh-oh! Its him, that doctor!

1676
01:23:01,545 --> 01:23:02,459
Leave at once!

1677
01:23:03,642 --> 01:23:07,268
I have punished such culprits by
making them do mimicry whole night!

1678
01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:11,111
The guy who spoke to me on the
phone must come here at once!

1679
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:15,524
-My Lord!
-What?

1680
01:23:15,649 --> 01:23:16,462
Why my Lord?

1681
01:23:17,297 --> 01:23:21,727
I have seen you upset more
than being calm and set!

1682
01:23:22,242 --> 01:23:22,766
See?

1683
01:23:22,836 --> 01:23:26,824
If you keep getting upset like
this then you'll snap and die!

1684
01:23:27,192 --> 01:23:31,207
Then we'll have to replace
that Ox skull with yours

1685
01:23:31,567 --> 01:23:32,434
How dare you?

1686
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:35,748
Don't growl too much! We
won't miss this time!

1687
01:23:36,123 --> 01:23:38,826
I have the perfect
plan this time!

1688
01:23:39,522 --> 01:23:40,665
Tell me your so called plan!

1689
01:23:40,826 --> 01:23:41,594
Ask me like that!

1690
01:23:41,702 --> 01:23:44,734
Last time booze spilled because I
had to make the drink while driving

1691
01:23:45,085 --> 01:23:47,382
So this time I already
made the drink and got it

1692
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,835
So definitely it won't
spill this time!

1693
01:23:49,881 --> 01:23:50,726
Wonderful!

1694
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:52,657
You forgot the snacks

1695
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,687
Thanks a lot, my Lord!

1696
01:23:55,912 --> 01:23:56,654
You son of a...

1697
01:23:59,059 --> 01:23:59,559
Sir...

1698
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,770
-Put the inspector online
-Yes, sir

1699
01:24:02,778 --> 01:24:03,765
AC is on the line

1700
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:07,140
Yes, sir. Tell me

1701
01:24:07,186 --> 01:24:07,843
Manickam...

1702
01:24:08,054 --> 01:24:09,148
he's my friend's son

1703
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:11,539
-Sir, this fellow...
-I know everything

1704
01:24:11,632 --> 01:24:13,375
Will ensure you're taken care of.
Just leave him

1705
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,320
Okay, sir

1706
01:24:17,984 --> 01:24:18,546
Leave

1707
01:24:18,773 --> 01:24:19,499
Take him with you

1708
01:24:19,523 --> 01:24:21,125
-I shall take leave, sir
-Let's go

1709
01:24:22,953 --> 01:24:23,898
Where is he?

1710
01:24:24,445 --> 01:24:25,188
There

1711
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:28,540
So, you're hiding here?
Wait I'll inform

1712
01:24:28,892 --> 01:24:32,142
-Sir, the guy who spoke to you is here
-Jeyaraj, no!

1713
01:24:32,211 --> 01:24:33,954
-Come, let's go
-Hands off me!

1714
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,701
Yesterday that's girl
dad just made one call

1715
01:24:36,825 --> 01:24:38,935
She was treated with respect
and sent off in a car

1716
01:24:38,966 --> 01:24:41,888
But after you called him, he got
pissed off and put me in prison

1717
01:24:42,068 --> 01:24:44,813
Call yourself an advocate
hereafter and...

1718
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:51,571
My Lord, I saw the
goat and it's kid

1719
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:56,302
I gave you a job and instead
you're grazing goats around?

1720
01:24:56,404 --> 01:24:58,092
Goat is the code word here

1721
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:01,037
If I come there, I'll
slit your throat!

1722
01:25:01,209 --> 01:25:02,350
Speak in a way I can understand

1723
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:04,811
Start the truck now and the
timing would be perfect!

1724
01:25:07,357 --> 01:25:09,835
I'm stuck in between two fools!

1725
01:25:22,557 --> 01:25:25,174
Father and son were together.
Now they split ways!

1726
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,581
They split ways and drink alone

1727
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:31,495
They drink at the same bar but
later act like they no nothing

1728
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:33,937
I'll deal you later

1729
01:25:34,039 --> 01:25:36,609
You keep biting your tongue
in anger and then bash me up!

1730
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,071
Stop showing your power to me!
Eyes on the road!

1731
01:25:45,743 --> 01:25:47,157
Awesome song. Increase the volume

1732
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,040
Someone's calling.
Check who is it

1733
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:51,368
It was the ringtone?
Good you mentioned

1734
01:25:51,883 --> 01:25:54,028
Whoa! My Lord...

1735
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,653
your son is calling

1736
01:25:55,676 --> 01:25:56,636
What should I tell him?

1737
01:25:57,012 --> 01:25:58,762
We'll run over that guy's father...

1738
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:00,520
and give him a good news soon!
Tell him that

1739
01:26:00,677 --> 01:26:01,366
Okay

1740
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:02,537
Hello

1741
01:26:02,623 --> 01:26:03,357
Tell me, Venkat

1742
01:26:03,427 --> 01:26:05,591
It wasn't the guy's father
who broke up my love

1743
01:26:05,677 --> 01:26:06,177
Is it?

1744
01:26:06,271 --> 01:26:07,263
-Let go of me
-It was the girl's father!

1745
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,155
My Lord, our target is
the girl's father...

1746
01:26:12,194 --> 01:26:14,514
-Turn!
-What are you doing?

1747
01:26:23,438 --> 01:26:25,195
-Check out what happened!
-Come on! Come on!

1748
01:26:31,888 --> 01:26:32,802
Hello 108 ambulance

1749
01:26:33,044 --> 01:26:34,348
-Yes, that's the place
-Come on

1750
01:26:35,154 --> 01:26:36,130
Make it fast

1751
01:26:36,498 --> 01:26:37,341
An accident

1752
01:26:43,758 --> 01:26:46,063
Same vehicle and the same guy!

1753
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,735
Try learning to drive a
truck in an empty ground

1754
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,282
Why do you take such risks?

1755
01:26:53,656 --> 01:26:55,305
The ambulance is here.
I shall leave now

1756
01:26:55,531 --> 01:26:58,015
You're our saviour
once again, sir

1757
01:26:58,530 --> 01:26:59,194
Look at that...

1758
01:26:59,655 --> 01:27:02,988
The guy whom we were about
to murder is advising us!

1759
01:27:03,613 --> 01:27:06,378
Fine, why did you turn left?

1760
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:10,128
Our target is the girl's father!

1761
01:27:10,455 --> 01:27:12,127
He is the guy's father

1762
01:27:13,234 --> 01:27:16,220
I avoided a major accident!

1763
01:27:16,838 --> 01:27:20,485
So you think this is a minor one?
Huh!?

1764
01:27:26,054 --> 01:27:26,967
Divya, wait!

1765
01:27:27,506 --> 01:27:28,936
Divya, come here!

1766
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:33,892
What is the problem?

1767
01:27:33,994 --> 01:27:36,033
-Your daughter is in love
-Again?

1768
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:36,861
Divya...

1769
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:39,785
I've never raised hands on
you since your childhood

1770
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:41,878
But today...

1771
01:27:42,527 --> 01:27:44,894
I feel like breaking your jaws!

1772
01:27:45,253 --> 01:27:47,777
If I come to know that you are
roaming around with that guy...

1773
01:27:48,089 --> 01:27:49,042
that will be the end

1774
01:27:49,081 --> 01:27:50,355
What are you saying?

1775
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:52,956
That will be the end of that guy!

1776
01:27:55,597 --> 01:27:56,284
Divya

1777
01:27:58,751 --> 01:27:59,851
Keep it aside

1778
01:28:00,006 --> 01:28:01,647
Don't mistake it for
booze and drink it!

1779
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:07,941
You fat bomb, what
are you doing here?

1780
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:10,800
Mind your tongue. Don't
call me a fat bomb!

1781
01:28:10,957 --> 01:28:13,658
If you think I'm a fat bomb then
hurl me at our enemy nation

1782
01:28:13,806 --> 01:28:15,439
I shall destroy the enemy nation

1783
01:28:15,705 --> 01:28:17,431
You're stealing fuel
in the broad daylight!

1784
01:28:17,494 --> 01:28:21,917
Your son wanted us to fill up petrol
and make petrol bomb out of it

1785
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:24,144
Fool! So you're
making bomb for real?

1786
01:28:27,113 --> 01:28:28,394
Why did he ask you to do it?

1787
01:28:30,883 --> 01:28:31,750
Come here

1788
01:28:35,157 --> 01:28:36,961
Go and ask him

1789
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:38,750
Go!

1790
01:28:38,829 --> 01:28:41,050
Asks us thinking
he'll get an answer!

1791
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,871
Don't make any hasty decision.
Listen to me

1792
01:28:48,293 --> 01:28:49,293
Welcome Prakash

1793
01:28:49,347 --> 01:28:49,910
Hi

1794
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:51,574
Get me anticipatory bail

1795
01:28:51,715 --> 01:28:52,433
Why?

1796
01:28:52,496 --> 01:28:54,699
My girlfriend's father...

1797
01:28:54,972 --> 01:28:56,738
is threatening her
to break up with me

1798
01:28:57,072 --> 01:28:59,064
So,  I'm gonna plan and...

1799
01:28:59,821 --> 01:29:00,555
finish him off!

1800
01:29:00,962 --> 01:29:03,696
Jeyaraj, don't make
any hasty decision

1801
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:05,532
Poor old fellow

1802
01:29:05,662 --> 01:29:06,467
Poor?

1803
01:29:06,936 --> 01:29:08,999
He'll bleed today for sure!

1804
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,789
Jeyaraj, that's how
girl's parents are

1805
01:29:11,991 --> 01:29:13,874
Doesn't mean you
must finish him off

1806
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,219
Make him understand!

1807
01:29:15,711 --> 01:29:16,641
Listen to your mom

1808
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:20,435
You just bring the girl here.
Then we'll face whatever happens

1809
01:29:20,492 --> 01:29:21,180
Shut up!

1810
01:29:21,758 --> 01:29:23,039
Don't listen to your mom

1811
01:29:24,335 --> 01:29:25,950
You just said listen to her

1812
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:28,033
And immediately you
changed your stand?

1813
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,298
You're creating a lot of
confusion, Mr. Nosy man!

1814
01:29:30,369 --> 01:29:31,517
Keep that aside

1815
01:29:31,603 --> 01:29:33,517
This is something that
we can discuss and solve

1816
01:29:33,598 --> 01:29:34,293
Don't blow it up

1817
01:29:34,395 --> 01:29:36,332
-Then go and talk
-To whom?

1818
01:29:36,378 --> 01:29:38,128
-To my girlfriend's dad
-When?

1819
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:39,418
Now! Come, let's go

1820
01:29:40,497 --> 01:29:41,719
This is too fast

1821
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:43,580
First, sit down. Sit down

1822
01:29:44,407 --> 01:29:47,688
Let's not be fools like the donkey
that took off for no reason

1823
01:29:47,821 --> 01:29:50,188
I'm sure her dad
won't be at home now

1824
01:29:50,546 --> 01:29:51,819
How are you so sure?

1825
01:29:51,881 --> 01:29:54,937
I am an advocate. This
is just an easy guess

1826
01:29:55,225 --> 01:29:58,468
Do one thing. Call her and ask

1827
01:29:58,921 --> 01:29:59,844
Try once

1828
01:30:07,743 --> 01:30:09,191
-Raj!
-Sweetheart

1829
01:30:09,292 --> 01:30:12,229
I asked my dad to come with
me and talk to your dad...

1830
01:30:12,269 --> 01:30:14,988
but my dad tells me that
your father isn't home.

1831
01:30:15,021 --> 01:30:16,770
You tell me. Is your
father at home?

1832
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:19,668
Wow! How many 'dads'
in a 'dad' sentence!

1833
01:30:19,717 --> 01:30:21,355
-This girl I tell you!
-You're awesome man!

1834
01:30:21,433 --> 01:30:23,543
Dear, is your father
at home or not?

1835
01:30:23,612 --> 01:30:24,948
Your dad is right

1836
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,417
My dad is not at home. He'll
return only after two days

1837
01:30:28,753 --> 01:30:30,010
He isn't home?

1838
01:30:30,135 --> 01:30:32,197
He'll be back after say
couple of days, right?

1839
01:30:32,259 --> 01:30:33,446
How do you know this?

1840
01:30:33,509 --> 01:30:36,783
I'm an advocate. 150
divorce case in one year!

1841
01:30:36,947 --> 01:30:39,158
Again, all these are guesses.
Just wait...

1842
01:30:39,509 --> 01:30:40,933
we'll talk to him after he's back

1843
01:30:45,636 --> 01:30:46,550
Phew!

1844
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:50,342
-Hello
-Darling, how about this?

1845
01:30:50,459 --> 01:30:53,094
Put a conference call with your dad

1846
01:30:53,485 --> 01:30:55,887
My dad says that he'll talk to
him and solve things smoothly

1847
01:30:55,912 --> 01:30:56,850
I'm scared!

1848
01:30:56,912 --> 01:30:58,467
Why are you scared
when I am here? Call him

1849
01:30:59,235 --> 01:31:00,219
Be confident! Call him

1850
01:31:00,977 --> 01:31:01,610
Okay

1851
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:16,793
Hello

1852
01:31:16,817 --> 01:31:18,809
My friend's father
wants to talk to you

1853
01:31:18,942 --> 01:31:20,739
Don't waste my time!
What's the matter?

1854
01:31:20,825 --> 01:31:22,872
He will convey it to you

1855
01:31:22,997 --> 01:31:25,171
Please stay on the line,
I'll put a conferee

1856
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:29,405
Raj, my dad is on the line. Talk

1857
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,093
Greetings, uncle

1858
01:31:31,647 --> 01:31:35,105
You're an elder person. This
matter must be discussed in person

1859
01:31:35,493 --> 01:31:38,003
Don't mistake that I'm discussing
it over a conference call

1860
01:31:38,714 --> 01:31:40,722
Just a minute, my dad wants to talk

1861
01:31:41,128 --> 01:31:41,941
Dad!

1862
01:31:42,148 --> 01:31:42,757
Hello

1863
01:31:43,993 --> 01:31:45,751
Whom are you talking to now?

1864
01:31:45,789 --> 01:31:46,703
It's a court issue

1865
01:31:47,149 --> 01:31:48,829
Her father is on the call. Talk

1866
01:31:49,996 --> 01:31:50,812
Talk

1867
01:31:51,604 --> 01:31:53,026
-Hello
-Hello, uncle

1868
01:31:53,065 --> 01:31:54,034
Go ahead and talk, uncle

1869
01:31:54,276 --> 01:31:55,471
My dad is there on the call

1870
01:31:55,521 --> 01:31:56,209
Hello

1871
01:31:57,082 --> 01:31:57,796
Talk!

1872
01:31:58,210 --> 01:31:58,754
Uncle...

1873
01:31:59,691 --> 01:32:00,981
-Are you there on the line?
-Hello

1874
01:32:01,028 --> 01:32:02,832
-Dad, can you hear me?
-I can hear you

1875
01:32:02,909 --> 01:32:05,363
You can hear, right? Break
it to him! Break it!

1876
01:32:05,426 --> 01:32:06,770
I'll break it .Have patience

1877
01:32:07,191 --> 01:32:07,832
Hello?

1878
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:09,872
Hello, uncle?

1879
01:32:09,974 --> 01:32:11,966
Advocate Prakash Raj speaking

1880
01:32:12,302 --> 01:32:13,216
Go ahead and talk, uncle

1881
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,169
I've been practicing as a
lawyer for the past 20 years

1882
01:32:15,357 --> 01:32:16,607
I can hear you clearly

1883
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,771
Uncle, do you hear
dad's voice clearly?

1884
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:22,802
I can hear but I hear my
voice in the feedback

1885
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:24,817
Give it to me. Give!

1886
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:26,270
Useless!

1887
01:32:26,927 --> 01:32:28,208
-Divya
-Tell me

1888
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,544
-Could you hear my dad?
-No

1889
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,724
I only hear my dad's voice

1890
01:32:33,785 --> 01:32:36,337
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, clearly

1891
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:38,056
Then you must hear my dad too

1892
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:39,118
Wonder what's the issue

1893
01:32:39,149 --> 01:32:39,892
Hold on a minute

1894
01:32:40,696 --> 01:32:41,196
Talk

1895
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:43,298
Hello

1896
01:32:43,954 --> 01:32:45,707
Advocate Prakash Raj speaking

1897
01:32:46,184 --> 01:32:47,676
Did you hear my dad's voice?

1898
01:32:48,292 --> 01:32:51,957
God! Again I hear
only my dad's voice

1899
01:32:52,277 --> 01:32:54,530
Forget it. Is your dad on the call?

1900
01:32:54,608 --> 01:32:55,264
Yes, he is

1901
01:32:55,554 --> 01:32:57,077
Hello, uncle?

1902
01:32:57,467 --> 01:32:58,287
Hello, unc...

1903
01:33:01,062 --> 01:33:02,620
Why did you hang up now?

1904
01:33:03,151 --> 01:33:05,112
-Whom are you calling again?
-My girlfriend

1905
01:33:05,503 --> 01:33:08,089
Her dad is on the call yet
he didn't speak on purpose

1906
01:33:08,644 --> 01:33:10,636
It was so evident!

1907
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,786
Her father is not
interested in this

1908
01:33:12,942 --> 01:33:13,817
That's the fact

1909
01:33:13,918 --> 01:33:16,606
He might hold grudge and
fight with his daughter

1910
01:33:16,763 --> 01:33:19,137
She better marry
the guy her dad...

1911
01:33:19,403 --> 01:33:22,110
Just say it for now
and rest I'll manage

1912
01:33:22,539 --> 01:33:24,516
She's an educated girl

1913
01:33:24,743 --> 01:33:26,133
She'll understand

1914
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,744
Did you find out who
is that girl's father?

1915
01:33:37,798 --> 01:33:39,995
-I got his number
-Dear...

1916
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:42,072
why this carnage?

1917
01:33:42,494 --> 01:33:44,658
You're trying to give
him serious problems...

1918
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,827
but it ends up in us have
more serious problems

1919
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,921
Listen to me. For God's
sake, leave all this

1920
01:33:50,444 --> 01:33:53,476
For my sake. Leave all this

1921
01:33:54,601 --> 01:33:57,270
You want me to spare the person
who broke up our son's love?

1922
01:33:58,894 --> 01:34:00,878
Sketch out a plan to finish
of that girl's father!

1923
01:34:11,285 --> 01:34:13,483
Why didn't you collect the
milk packet from doorstep?

1924
01:34:13,538 --> 01:34:14,850
Our daughter usually collects it

1925
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:17,358
But today your daughter
is quite upset

1926
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:33,394
I asked you to break
up with that guy

1927
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:36,239
I never stopped you
from stepping out

1928
01:34:40,874 --> 01:34:41,843
It's for you, dear

1929
01:34:42,398 --> 01:34:46,702
I got a lunch coupon for two
at Friend's park restaurant

1930
01:34:47,335 --> 01:34:48,872
Take any of your friends and go

1931
01:34:49,013 --> 01:34:51,388
Do you think she'll go
with any of her friends?

1932
01:34:51,521 --> 01:34:54,755
She'll definitely go with that guy
and you're making it easy for her

1933
01:34:55,247 --> 01:34:56,661
I am your daughter

1934
01:34:56,989 --> 01:35:00,802
I will never go out with
someone you don't approve of

1935
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:05,705
My guess was right

1936
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:07,830
Guys are more trustworthy

1937
01:35:08,174 --> 01:35:09,869
But never trust girls!

1938
01:35:10,456 --> 01:35:11,463
Mind blowing actress!

1939
01:35:11,822 --> 01:35:13,204
She gave a hell of a performance

1940
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:19,465
Boss, what are you doing here?

1941
01:35:19,809 --> 01:35:23,044
That chick is waiting there
and is getting restless

1942
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:26,050
You're over there? Wait, I'm coming

1943
01:35:26,843 --> 01:35:29,062
So, whose love are we
breaking up today?

1944
01:35:30,227 --> 01:35:31,633
Boss, your son!

1945
01:35:31,729 --> 01:35:33,823
Boss, first time you
did it by mistake!

1946
01:35:33,862 --> 01:35:35,370
Why are you doing
it on purpose now?

1947
01:35:35,804 --> 01:35:36,905
The situation calls for it

1948
01:35:37,052 --> 01:35:38,189
By the way, who is the girl?

1949
01:35:39,253 --> 01:35:40,120
This girl?

1950
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:43,064
We split her up from
a guy last month...

1951
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,603
and she's already seeing your son?

1952
01:35:45,219 --> 01:35:47,297
If I catch hold of her father...

1953
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,813
I'll slap him and ask "Is this
how you raise a daughter?"

1954
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:52,305
Why are you getting upset, boss?

1955
01:35:53,313 --> 01:35:54,444
Regular customer?

1956
01:35:55,295 --> 01:35:56,693
They have arrived. Get to work!

1957
01:35:56,855 --> 01:35:58,347
Dad gave me these coupons

1958
01:35:58,965 --> 01:35:59,895
Where did she go?

1959
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:02,660
-She was here
-They are here but where is she?

1960
01:36:02,839 --> 01:36:03,495
I don't know

1961
01:36:03,519 --> 01:36:04,917
-Go and search
-I'm on it, boss

1962
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:12,525
-What do you have for starters?
-Yes madam, your order please

1963
01:36:13,552 --> 01:36:14,767
Sir! What are you doing here?

1964
01:36:16,192 --> 01:36:18,825
Why are you roaming around in
more disguise than 'Kamal Hassan?'

1965
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:21,013
-Aren't you the guy from the textiles?
-Yes!

1966
01:36:21,076 --> 01:36:21,823
What are you doing here?

1967
01:36:21,877 --> 01:36:22,377
Sir...

1968
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:24,205
I served juice over there.
Here I serve soups

1969
01:36:25,518 --> 01:36:26,018
Sir...

1970
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,143
Does your father know
about your girlfriend?

1971
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,193
Why are you so concerned?
Go, bring the soup

1972
01:36:32,365 --> 01:36:33,106
Sir...

1973
01:36:33,232 --> 01:36:35,349
-You don't need this
-You mean the soup?

1974
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:37,529
-No, sir! This relationship
-I'll break your hip!

1975
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:38,481
Get lost!

1976
01:36:39,029 --> 01:36:41,114
Keeps torturing me
every now and then!

1977
01:36:45,622 --> 01:36:46,692
Boss!

1978
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:49,419
Uh-oh! I am so scared that
I don't know how to react

1979
01:36:49,763 --> 01:36:50,864
Is this your scared look?

1980
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:52,903
So this is your scared look?

1981
01:36:53,879 --> 01:36:56,770
I asked you to find her! Instead
you're enjoying a smoke?

1982
01:36:56,966 --> 01:36:58,083
-I'm on it, boss
-Now!

1983
01:36:59,766 --> 01:37:01,954
I'll go and check the
live counter and buffet

1984
01:37:01,985 --> 01:37:02,719
Okay

1985
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,079
Dad! Uh-oh!

1986
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:19,691
Let's leave this place at once

1987
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:22,050
-Why? What happened?
-Come on! I'll tell you

1988
01:37:22,425 --> 01:37:24,386
-What happened?
-My dad is here

1989
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:25,480
See that?

1990
01:37:25,557 --> 01:37:28,413
He is spying on you!

1991
01:37:32,397 --> 01:37:34,038
-Whom are you calling?
-My father

1992
01:37:35,459 --> 01:37:36,788
Why are you calling him now?

1993
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:40,466
Let's make a call today!
Let's not drag it

1994
01:37:41,762 --> 01:37:43,786
Let's not create a
scene in the public

1995
01:37:44,342 --> 01:37:46,498
I'll inform you when
my father is at home

1996
01:37:47,145 --> 01:37:48,153
Then you bring him

1997
01:37:48,977 --> 01:37:50,006
Shall we leave now?

1998
01:37:50,335 --> 01:37:51,092
Please

1999
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:58,291
I forgot the key. Let
me go and get it

2000
01:37:59,283 --> 01:38:00,931
Please don't create
unnecessary problems

2001
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:02,041
Please! Please!

2002
01:38:02,105 --> 01:38:04,690
I'm not going drag any fight with
him. I forgot the key for real

2003
01:38:05,355 --> 01:38:06,784
-Wait, I'll get it
-Please!

2004
01:38:09,707 --> 01:38:10,917
Where did she go?

2005
01:38:12,431 --> 01:38:14,198
Excuse me! What are you doing here?

2006
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:16,439
Is the concerned party here?

2007
01:38:16,496 --> 01:38:17,215
Yes!

2008
01:38:17,277 --> 01:38:19,589
Third table and his name
is Jeyaraj. Correct?

2009
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,277
Correct! Now, go!

2010
01:38:22,785 --> 01:38:23,324
Sir...

2011
01:38:24,775 --> 01:38:26,098
you are also here?

2012
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,762
Sir, I wanna know the truth!

2013
01:38:27,871 --> 01:38:28,456
What truth?

2014
01:38:28,503 --> 01:38:31,012
Do you know that your son and your
daughter are in a relationship?

2015
01:38:31,191 --> 01:38:32,808
I know! Shut up and
mind your business

2016
01:38:32,863 --> 01:38:34,333
-You know it?
-Doofus!

2017
01:38:35,099 --> 01:38:36,271
What a filthy family!

2018
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:38,151
Hey Jeyaraj!

2019
01:38:38,666 --> 01:38:39,479
How are you?

2020
01:38:39,779 --> 01:38:43,131
Why did you stop calling me?
No messages or Whatsapp messages?

2021
01:38:43,766 --> 01:38:45,547
I'm free this Saturday

2022
01:38:46,056 --> 01:38:47,100
What do you say?

2023
01:38:48,279 --> 01:38:49,725
Why are you blinking, Jeyaraj?

2024
01:38:49,943 --> 01:38:52,383
Oh! Your current girlfriend?

2025
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:54,855
What about that other girl?
You dumped her?

2026
01:38:55,073 --> 01:38:57,268
What's with this look? Clean
shave is your usual look

2027
01:38:57,533 --> 01:38:59,518
What's with the beard
and mustache?

2028
01:39:00,266 --> 01:39:01,189
Excuse me

2029
01:39:01,787 --> 01:39:03,631
I guess you're pranking
the wrong person

2030
01:39:03,731 --> 01:39:05,426
Jeyaraj is sitting on another table

2031
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,374
Your boss is calling you

2032
01:39:08,594 --> 01:39:09,702
Your boss is calling you

2033
01:39:09,812 --> 01:39:11,093
Brother, throw me that key

2034
01:39:20,848 --> 01:39:22,225
Wasn't it that table?

2035
01:39:22,888 --> 01:39:25,099
That's the right table, boss
but your son is missing

2036
01:39:25,498 --> 01:39:27,878
He was here until now.
Where did he go?

2037
01:39:28,706 --> 01:39:31,550
Show the correct person! Don't
break up innocent couples

2038
01:39:31,605 --> 01:39:33,356
Wait, they'll be back

2039
01:39:33,395 --> 01:39:34,168
Then we'll resume

2040
01:39:39,073 --> 01:39:40,710
Why so late to get the key?

2041
01:39:40,824 --> 01:39:42,896
Not just your dad, even
my dad is in there

2042
01:39:43,059 --> 01:39:45,402
I think they had planned
it out and got us here

2043
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,501
What plan?

2044
01:39:46,838 --> 01:39:48,244
To break us up

2045
01:39:48,837 --> 01:39:50,540
What else does do these nuts know?

2046
01:39:50,774 --> 01:39:53,173
I guess my dad would have
taken money from your dad

2047
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:54,314
What do we do now?

2048
01:39:55,127 --> 01:39:58,017
Don't act like you know this.
Keep quiet at home

2049
01:39:58,315 --> 01:40:00,330
I'll come up with a plan
tonight and let you know

2050
01:40:03,133 --> 01:40:04,867
Divya, it's late. Aren't
you having dinner?

2051
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:08,264
No, thanks mom. I'm full from the
treat dad threw me this afternoon

2052
01:40:13,475 --> 01:40:15,188
Aren't you having dinner?

2053
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:17,201
I'll have this and then eat

2054
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,552
Both of you go to hell!

2055
01:40:18,663 --> 01:40:20,349
There are Dosas in the hot pack.
I'm going to sleep

2056
01:40:22,995 --> 01:40:24,792
Why do I feel the measure
of the booze is reduced?

2057
01:40:24,917 --> 01:40:27,167
Yeah, my boyfriend was here.
He drank some!

2058
01:40:27,292 --> 01:40:29,870
You keep drinking it then
obviously it'll reduce!

2059
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:33,146
Of late both mom and
daughter are too sarcastic!

2060
01:40:40,854 --> 01:40:43,354
Why is Mr. Nosy boss calling now?

2061
01:40:44,729 --> 01:40:45,518
Boss!

2062
01:40:45,565 --> 01:40:47,151
-Where are you?
-Where else?

2063
01:40:47,197 --> 01:40:48,651
When night falls you can
find me in Hero's bar

2064
01:40:48,854 --> 01:40:50,026
Our plan failed today

2065
01:40:50,173 --> 01:40:52,173
Think of some good idea by tomorrow

2066
01:40:52,237 --> 01:40:52,885
Boss...

2067
01:40:53,081 --> 01:40:55,301
are you out of ideas?
You're an idea bank!

2068
01:40:55,387 --> 01:40:56,512
Well, I don't know

2069
01:40:56,746 --> 01:40:58,980
My mind is not working for
the past couple of days

2070
01:40:59,175 --> 01:41:00,441
Your mind is not working?

2071
01:41:01,051 --> 01:41:04,369
He talks as if he's a scientist who
invents new things everyday!

2072
01:41:05,204 --> 01:41:05,899
Boss...

2073
01:41:06,212 --> 01:41:07,657
don't you worry

2074
01:41:08,008 --> 01:41:10,798
I'll finish this quarter bottle of
booze and give you an awesome idea!

2075
01:41:11,876 --> 01:41:13,727
I know you'll finish that
and order another one

2076
01:41:13,868 --> 01:41:15,134
I'm sure you won't
come up with anything

2077
01:41:15,168 --> 01:41:16,792
Hang up! I'll come
up with something

2078
01:42:04,315 --> 01:42:06,416
No more use in hiding the truth

2079
01:42:07,026 --> 01:42:08,399
I better open up!

2080
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:15,219
Nalina...

2081
01:42:16,327 --> 01:42:17,234
Nalina!

2082
01:42:19,459 --> 01:42:22,053
Go to sleep! It's too late

2083
01:42:22,373 --> 01:42:24,589
Not every time after drinking!
Just go

2084
01:42:24,808 --> 01:42:27,386
Not that! I have something
important to tell you

2085
01:42:27,386 --> 01:42:28,534
I said, go to sleep!

2086
01:42:29,315 --> 01:42:29,873
One slap...

2087
01:42:30,956 --> 01:42:31,672
Get lost!

2088
01:42:52,737 --> 01:42:54,385
-What is it?
-Are you asleep?

2089
01:42:54,424 --> 01:42:55,846
No! I was doing the laundry!

2090
01:42:55,924 --> 01:42:56,713
At this hour?

2091
01:42:56,766 --> 01:42:58,485
When you know the
answer then why ask?

2092
01:42:58,572 --> 01:43:00,798
I have to tell you
something important

2093
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:03,267
You won't come home
tonight, is that it?

2094
01:43:03,564 --> 01:43:04,755
I know that. Now, hang up

2095
01:43:05,310 --> 01:43:06,685
Ramani! Ramani!

2096
01:43:32,836 --> 01:43:33,595
Nalina

2097
01:43:34,469 --> 01:43:35,125
Nalina

2098
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:36,766
Divya

2099
01:43:37,196 --> 01:43:37,891
Divya

2100
01:43:38,329 --> 01:43:39,024
Nalina!

2101
01:43:46,194 --> 01:43:48,194
He's downstairs! You better leave!

2102
01:43:48,327 --> 01:43:49,632
You promised to give me

2103
01:43:49,632 --> 01:43:51,608
-You leave
-But no one's here

2104
01:43:52,257 --> 01:43:54,108
-Please give me
-I said, leave!

2105
01:43:54,413 --> 01:43:54,913
Look!

2106
01:43:55,186 --> 01:43:57,831
I won't leave until you give me

2107
01:43:57,854 --> 01:43:59,284
-Listen to me!
-What?

2108
01:43:59,354 --> 01:44:01,948
My husband's downstairs at home.
He might catch us!

2109
01:44:02,104 --> 01:44:04,721
-Give me and only then I'll leave
-Please leave!

2110
01:44:04,791 --> 01:44:05,941
Leave!

2111
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,847
How many times have
I given you before?

2112
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:09,519
-Now, leave
-Why are you making me beg?

2113
01:44:09,574 --> 01:44:12,808
You come only when he's
not home but why now?

2114
01:44:13,261 --> 01:44:15,196
Please leave! Try to understand!

2115
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:18,016
-Give and I shall leave
-Told you repeatedly! Leave!

2116
01:44:18,297 --> 01:44:20,172
Where is the tee shirt
with the cat's portrait?

2117
01:44:20,227 --> 01:44:21,891
A cat stole it

2118
01:44:21,961 --> 01:44:25,464
Aren't you my darling. Get me the booze
that your husband has stocked up

2119
01:44:25,535 --> 01:44:28,636
I gave you earlier and already he
got a doubt. You better leave!

2120
01:44:28,714 --> 01:44:30,550
Why do I feel the measure
of the booze is reduced?

2121
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,951
Yeah, my boyfriend was here.
He drank some!

2122
01:44:33,076 --> 01:44:36,755
Why do you keep refusing for
anything and everything I ask?

2123
01:44:36,873 --> 01:44:38,544
Please understand! Leave!

2124
01:44:40,404 --> 01:44:43,029
-Wait until he's gone
-Please!

2125
01:44:48,891 --> 01:44:49,938
Please!

2126
01:44:50,907 --> 01:44:51,938
He's here!

2127
01:44:54,519 --> 01:44:55,824
-Give me that bottle!
-Hit him!

2128
01:44:56,697 --> 01:44:58,191
Hit him hard and kill him!

2129
01:44:58,269 --> 01:45:00,496
-Who do you think you are?
-Stab him!

2130
01:45:00,722 --> 01:45:04,198
-Stab him! Deeper!
-You are dead today! We'll be happy only if you die!

2131
01:45:05,752 --> 01:45:06,768
Stab him!

2132
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,526
What are you wondering?

2133
01:45:10,151 --> 01:45:11,902
I was waiting to see you die!

2134
01:45:15,433 --> 01:45:16,808
Stabbing on stomach won't kill him

2135
01:45:17,033 --> 01:45:17,980
Stab on his throat!

2136
01:45:22,266 --> 01:45:23,587
Come on!

2137
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:28,149
-Stop torturing me and leave
-No, I won't!

2138
01:45:28,297 --> 01:45:30,557
-Quiet! Don't shout!
-Please give me

2139
01:45:30,588 --> 01:45:33,518
-Why are you doing this?
-Someone might watch us

2140
01:45:33,698 --> 01:45:36,237
-Who else do I got?
-Fine, I'll give

2141
01:45:36,409 --> 01:45:37,549
-Now!
-Someone might watch us

2142
01:45:38,004 --> 01:45:39,675
No one's around

2143
01:45:40,636 --> 01:45:42,707
Not that way. Leave
through the path you came

2144
01:45:42,738 --> 01:45:44,184
Correct! Correct!

2145
01:45:50,612 --> 01:45:51,807
What are you looking at?

2146
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:54,471
The pipe connection at Prakash
Raj's home is under repair

2147
01:45:54,721 --> 01:45:55,349
Here

2148
01:45:57,182 --> 01:46:01,806
Okay bye! Drive!

2149
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:02,885
Something fishy!

2150
01:46:03,159 --> 01:46:05,321
The pipe connection at advocate's
house gets repaired often

2151
01:46:06,039 --> 01:46:08,273
Sir, is the pipe connection
at your home under repair?

2152
01:46:08,812 --> 01:46:09,601
Who told you?

2153
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,722
The guy who just left
in rickshaw; he told me

2154
01:46:12,579 --> 01:46:13,508
Yes, it's under repair

2155
01:46:14,693 --> 01:46:16,224
So is my life!

2156
01:46:18,675 --> 01:46:21,333
Sir, the water is pouring on you.
Move aside

2157
01:46:48,173 --> 01:46:50,127
What's this? What happened?

2158
01:46:50,438 --> 01:46:51,758
Why are you in this condition?

2159
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,883
I've to discuss something
important with you

2160
01:46:54,018 --> 01:46:55,003
First, sit down

2161
01:46:59,555 --> 01:47:00,616
Wipe your head, first

2162
01:47:07,007 --> 01:47:09,107
Ramani, I am a traitor

2163
01:47:09,669 --> 01:47:11,545
I betrayed you and
your son big time

2164
01:47:12,341 --> 01:47:13,059
Forgive me

2165
01:47:13,255 --> 01:47:15,239
-You must forgive me
-Why, dear?

2166
01:47:15,357 --> 01:47:16,982
For locking you up inside

2167
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:19,318
Wait inside until I'm
back from the wedding

2168
01:47:19,443 --> 01:47:20,255
Whose wedding?

2169
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,629
Our son's wedding

2170
01:47:22,559 --> 01:47:23,988
That wedding must not take place!

2171
01:47:24,066 --> 01:47:25,699
Listen to me, Ramani!
Open the door!

2172
01:47:25,738 --> 01:47:27,652
That is why I'm
locking you up inside

2173
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:29,973
Open the door. Listen
to me, Ramani!

2174
01:47:30,104 --> 01:47:32,455
Ramani, don't go! Ramani!

2175
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:35,518
-Vandu, move! -Someone
open the door please!

2176
01:47:38,847 --> 01:47:40,324
Somebody help me!

2177
01:47:40,558 --> 01:47:41,503
Open the door

2178
01:47:41,918 --> 01:47:42,652
Ramani!

2179
01:47:42,863 --> 01:47:43,446
Mom...

2180
01:47:43,941 --> 01:47:45,136
What's taking you so long?

2181
01:47:45,332 --> 01:47:46,902
I locked him up as per your orders

2182
01:47:47,004 --> 01:47:49,293
What if he creates a ruckus
and neighbours let him out?

2183
01:47:49,332 --> 01:47:51,449
Nobody will know. You get in

2184
01:47:51,707 --> 01:47:52,871
What's up, Jeyaraj?

2185
01:47:53,323 --> 01:47:55,519
Looks like someone's locked
up inside your house

2186
01:47:55,621 --> 01:47:58,160
I can hear someone knock from
inside. What's going on?

2187
01:47:58,213 --> 01:48:00,089
That's his dad

2188
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:01,504
Your dad?

2189
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:05,507
Where are you all off to
locking up your dad?

2190
01:48:05,905 --> 01:48:07,694
You heard him! Answer him

2191
01:48:08,224 --> 01:48:09,608
Well, Vandu...

2192
01:48:09,952 --> 01:48:11,571
a rabid dog bit my dad

2193
01:48:11,774 --> 01:48:14,704
We informed the corporation and
they asked us to lock him up

2194
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:15,807
So we locked him up

2195
01:48:15,992 --> 01:48:17,001
What are you saying?

2196
01:48:17,048 --> 01:48:20,409
Trust me. We are all going
to fetch the corporation van

2197
01:48:20,565 --> 01:48:21,200
Is it?

2198
01:48:21,471 --> 01:48:21,986
Wait

2199
01:48:22,676 --> 01:48:25,449
Why are you so well
dressed like a groom?

2200
01:48:25,692 --> 01:48:27,879
-Who's that girl? Never seen her before
-Vandu...

2201
01:48:28,035 --> 01:48:30,705
You love poking your nose in
other's family business, isn't it?

2202
01:48:30,868 --> 01:48:32,898
If you don't believe me,
then go open the door

2203
01:48:32,971 --> 01:48:34,635
You said a rabid dog bit him!
Why would I risk it?

2204
01:48:34,697 --> 01:48:36,853
Vandu, don't tell
this matter to anyone

2205
01:48:37,088 --> 01:48:39,517
Come on! You told me right?

2206
01:48:39,627 --> 01:48:41,275
Do you think I'll spread it around?

2207
01:48:41,275 --> 01:48:42,080
Kumar!

2208
01:48:43,322 --> 01:48:44,283
Vandu! Vandu!

2209
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:45,370
Open the door for me

2210
01:48:46,822 --> 01:48:50,369
Sir! Vandu, sir.
Please open the door

2211
01:48:50,431 --> 01:48:51,415
Like I'm gonna do that!

2212
01:48:51,588 --> 01:48:54,252
Remember that day?

2213
01:48:54,604 --> 01:48:57,690
The cops snatched away my booze

2214
01:48:58,182 --> 01:49:01,377
I asked you to fight in court and
retrieve me that but did you help me?

2215
01:49:01,456 --> 01:49:03,002
Till today I don't
have reply from you

2216
01:49:03,065 --> 01:49:05,549
Shameless fellow! Who are you
to me, for me to help you!

2217
01:49:05,916 --> 01:49:07,994
Wait let me spread
the news first!

2218
01:49:09,116 --> 01:49:09,763
Vandu!

2219
01:49:10,766 --> 01:49:13,846
The North Chennai is
surrounded by the ocean!

2220
01:49:14,242 --> 01:49:19,761
Parris is controlled by the
Gaana songs of Parris Jeyaraj!

2221
01:49:20,282 --> 01:49:24,131
His father, an advocate,
Mr. Prakash Raj...

2222
01:49:24,917 --> 01:49:26,997
was bit by a rabid dog!

2223
01:49:28,113 --> 01:49:31,086
Why are you looking at me like a country
fellow looking at a candy shop?

2224
01:49:31,386 --> 01:49:34,187
I'm speaking the truth.
It bit him on his back!

2225
01:49:35,978 --> 01:49:38,572
You don't have to open the door!
Please don't open your mouth either

2226
01:49:38,798 --> 01:49:39,704
You drunkard!

2227
01:49:42,408 --> 01:49:43,084
Excuse me...

2228
01:49:43,579 --> 01:49:45,282
whom are you talking about?

2229
01:49:46,016 --> 01:49:47,829
The fourth house in
the third street

2230
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:49,548
Third street and fourth house

2231
01:49:49,633 --> 01:49:50,728
The advocate...

2232
01:49:51,509 --> 01:49:52,329
Mr. Prakash Raj

2233
01:49:52,446 --> 01:49:54,423
His son is a famous
Gaana song singer

2234
01:49:54,478 --> 01:49:55,194
Gaana?

2235
01:49:58,602 --> 01:49:59,915
His dad is an advocate

2236
01:50:00,141 --> 01:50:01,063
Advocate?

2237
01:50:01,368 --> 01:50:02,056
Which house?

2238
01:50:02,235 --> 01:50:05,176
I'm pointing you to the house and
still you keep asking the same thing!

2239
01:50:05,223 --> 01:50:06,098
This house?

2240
01:50:08,722 --> 01:50:09,840
How is he doing now?

2241
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:12,403
I'll finish you off!

2242
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:14,551
I showed you the guy and the house

2243
01:50:14,584 --> 01:50:16,166
Take few steps and you
can find out yourself

2244
01:50:16,267 --> 01:50:17,626
But you keep repeating yourself!

2245
01:50:21,355 --> 01:50:24,077
Jeyaraj! Jeyaraj! Answer the call!

2246
01:50:26,007 --> 01:50:27,726
He just won't take a break

2247
01:50:31,492 --> 01:50:32,476
Who's on the phone, mom?

2248
01:50:33,304 --> 01:50:35,446
It's dad. Shall I
disconnect the call?

2249
01:50:35,485 --> 01:50:36,305
No, give it to me

2250
01:50:36,984 --> 01:50:38,763
-Here, handle this
-Hello! Hello!

2251
01:50:39,083 --> 01:50:40,108
Ramani, where are you?

2252
01:50:46,045 --> 01:50:47,545
Jeyaraj! Ramani! Don't play!

2253
01:50:47,693 --> 01:50:49,545
Fatso! Put Jeyaraj on the call

2254
01:50:54,138 --> 01:50:55,222
Poor guy, your dad

2255
01:50:56,422 --> 01:50:57,906
God! Dad is calling!

2256
01:50:57,961 --> 01:50:59,852
We switched off both the phones.
Then how is he able to reach us?

2257
01:50:59,906 --> 01:51:01,735
I meant my dad is calling!

2258
01:51:03,258 --> 01:51:05,899
Until the wedding is over, phones
are turned off for dads calls

2259
01:51:13,338 --> 01:51:13,838
Come

2260
01:51:16,301 --> 01:51:16,801
Yes, mom?

2261
01:51:16,802 --> 01:51:18,701
Jeyaraj, we gotta buy
everything for the rituals

2262
01:51:21,705 --> 01:51:22,973
-Priest...
-Who called me?

2263
01:51:23,715 --> 01:51:25,480
-Who was that?
-This way!

2264
01:51:27,192 --> 01:51:29,473
Why is your neck
bent like a fork?

2265
01:51:29,605 --> 01:51:32,558
Yesterday a doofus stamped on
my leg and walked away

2266
01:51:32,636 --> 01:51:34,340
I yelled "Watch out
you doofus" at him

2267
01:51:34,567 --> 01:51:36,918
He gave me one slap
and my neck sprained

2268
01:51:38,222 --> 01:51:40,556
Forget it. Why did you call me?

2269
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,336
What are you wondering?

2270
01:51:42,875 --> 01:51:44,602
Wondering why I called you

2271
01:51:45,421 --> 01:51:46,773
We need a priest to
get them married

2272
01:51:47,086 --> 01:51:48,070
Got the receipt?

2273
01:51:48,242 --> 01:51:49,393
What receipt?

2274
01:51:49,562 --> 01:51:51,288
Receipt of approval,
from the office

2275
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:54,186
-We just arrived here
-Drats!

2276
01:51:54,419 --> 01:51:56,560
Don't you know the rules?

2277
01:51:56,646 --> 01:52:00,854
You must come 21 days prior to
the wedding and fill a form

2278
01:52:00,931 --> 01:52:04,220
Then get the Village officer
approval, pay up the fee ...

2279
01:52:04,246 --> 01:52:05,660
and he'll give a receipt

2280
01:52:05,815 --> 01:52:08,831
Only if you have that receipt
you can get married...

2281
01:52:08,857 --> 01:52:09,914
I ask, who said so?

2282
01:52:10,014 --> 01:52:11,459
You can get married without it also!

2283
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,069
Buy the holy thread,
garlands and follow me

2284
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,915
You go ahead. Come on, mom

2285
01:52:40,235 --> 01:52:41,363
Where is it coming from?

2286
01:52:45,896 --> 01:52:47,889
Come and check this
out, one by one

2287
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:54,051
Oh my God!

2288
01:52:54,363 --> 01:52:56,152
Looks like he has indeed turned mad

2289
01:53:03,661 --> 01:53:04,161
Hello

2290
01:53:04,544 --> 01:53:05,232
Where are you?

2291
01:53:05,325 --> 01:53:06,513
First, tell me who are you?

2292
01:53:06,552 --> 01:53:08,927
Your daughter's boyfriend's father!

2293
01:53:09,005 --> 01:53:10,156
That's me again!

2294
01:53:10,186 --> 01:53:11,515
Oh my God!

2295
01:53:11,687 --> 01:53:13,281
Mind your tongue!

2296
01:53:13,452 --> 01:53:15,499
If I come there,
I'll finish you off!

2297
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:24,698
If he is really your son...

2298
01:53:24,846 --> 01:53:26,651
you'd have attacked me long back!

2299
01:53:26,994 --> 01:53:28,588
Guess, your son has no
idea who's his daddy

2300
01:53:28,619 --> 01:53:30,760
And that is why you act like threatening
me and that too over a call

2301
01:53:31,577 --> 01:53:32,757
Tell me, where are you?

2302
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:34,632
I'll come there and finish you off!

2303
01:53:35,156 --> 01:53:38,016
Come to Paris housing board and
ask for the advocate's house

2304
01:53:38,068 --> 01:53:38,861
I'm on my way!

2305
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:42,617
You better come within 10 minutes.
I'll leave after that

2306
01:53:42,697 --> 01:53:45,406
Don't come late and call me
again to find out where I am

2307
01:53:45,454 --> 01:53:47,071
I'm on my way! I am coming!

2308
01:53:47,212 --> 01:53:48,033
Hang up now!

2309
01:53:52,837 --> 01:53:56,146
Careful, my Lord!
Stairs are this way

2310
01:53:56,255 --> 01:53:57,544
-Move!
-Go! Go!

2311
01:54:00,864 --> 01:54:01,708
Oh my God!

2312
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,711
Are you blind?

2313
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:12,086
Lord! My Lord!

2314
01:54:12,194 --> 01:54:14,307
We must not spare his life!
Not at all!

2315
01:54:14,635 --> 01:54:15,252
Get in!

2316
01:54:21,659 --> 01:54:22,557
What's up, Mani?

2317
01:54:22,698 --> 01:54:24,323
Looks like you bought a new bike

2318
01:54:24,409 --> 01:54:26,315
-Yes
-Looks nice

2319
01:54:28,432 --> 01:54:30,612
He couldn't even
afford a shirt before

2320
01:54:30,744 --> 01:54:33,119
I helped him get a job
in the temple saloon

2321
01:54:33,268 --> 01:54:37,143
Today he charges more than the norms
and look he brought a new bike

2322
01:54:37,502 --> 01:54:40,562
I'm still using an old TVS 50.
My fate!

2323
01:54:40,609 --> 01:54:43,133
He's too jealous! Would it be right
to get married by such a priest?

2324
01:54:43,242 --> 01:54:44,460
Let's find someone else

2325
01:54:44,491 --> 01:54:45,874
We don't have much time

2326
01:54:45,975 --> 01:54:48,217
Priest, stop pondering
and lets get going

2327
01:54:48,325 --> 01:54:50,077
-Fine, let's go
-Move!

2328
01:54:50,452 --> 01:54:52,225
No one else has bought
anything new. Go!

2329
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,685
Doctor, advocate's house, right?

2330
01:55:08,552 --> 01:55:09,145
Follow me!

2331
01:55:09,208 --> 01:55:11,086
We didn't even ask him the address

2332
01:55:11,196 --> 01:55:11,742
Boys!

2333
01:55:11,938 --> 01:55:13,609
He must have a big
gang ready in there

2334
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:14,742
Be ready!

2335
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:17,032
I have the beer ready

2336
01:55:17,336 --> 01:55:19,495
What if they escape by the
time we have the beer?

2337
01:55:19,738 --> 01:55:22,659
First we'll finish him off!
Then we'll finish the beer off!

2338
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:24,105
Then will break the beer
bottles right here!

2339
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:24,792
Ouch!

2340
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:28,995
What are you guys waiting for?
Quick, come on!

2341
01:55:31,432 --> 01:55:32,557
This is the house

2342
01:55:32,783 --> 01:55:34,479
It'd be shameful for me
to go beyond this point

2343
01:55:34,548 --> 01:55:37,175
If you lift that beyond this point
it'd be shameful for everybody!

2344
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:38,217
Let's go in, first!

2345
01:55:38,584 --> 01:55:41,248
Doctor, be careful while catching
him. He might just bite you guys

2346
01:55:42,255 --> 01:55:44,537
-My Lord! It's locked!
-Call him up!

2347
01:55:49,995 --> 01:55:50,964
I hear his cellphone ringing!

2348
01:55:50,981 --> 01:55:52,432
He thinks he can play
advocate tricks with me?

2349
01:55:54,297 --> 01:55:55,548
Guys, he's inside!

2350
01:55:55,899 --> 01:55:57,321
-Break it down!
-Break the door!

2351
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:03,908
He is here somewhere

2352
01:56:04,048 --> 01:56:05,220
Search each and every room!

2353
01:56:05,353 --> 01:56:06,642
-Go!
-Okay, boss!

2354
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:08,829
-My Lord!
-What?

2355
01:56:08,923 --> 01:56:10,329
-I saw him!
-Where?

2356
01:56:10,383 --> 01:56:11,071
Look here

2357
01:56:14,423 --> 01:56:15,540
Oh God!

2358
01:56:15,828 --> 01:56:16,648
Search inside!

2359
01:56:17,726 --> 01:56:18,338
Who is it?

2360
01:56:19,377 --> 01:56:20,643
I'm hiding. Am I visible?

2361
01:56:20,745 --> 01:56:22,924
-I can see you clearly!
-Please help me, dear

2362
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:26,228
I am here for something else
but look what all I've to do

2363
01:56:26,954 --> 01:56:27,876
Oh, the burqa?

2364
01:56:27,954 --> 01:56:29,337
Aren't you that guy's father?

2365
01:56:29,407 --> 01:56:32,048
Why are you hiding here? Here
use this and hide yourself

2366
01:56:33,665 --> 01:56:35,939
-He the one we are looking for!
-Him?

2367
01:56:36,337 --> 01:56:37,618
He's running away! Catch him!

2368
01:56:38,165 --> 01:56:39,532
-I'll finish you off!
-Are you nuts?

2369
01:56:39,578 --> 01:56:41,078
-Catch him!
-He's not the one we're looking for!

2370
01:56:42,007 --> 01:56:43,093
He's escaping! Catch him!

2371
01:56:43,373 --> 01:56:44,521
Wait, boss

2372
01:56:44,576 --> 01:56:46,646
We are looking for
the girl's father

2373
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,349
He looks like the guy's father

2374
01:56:49,091 --> 01:56:51,778
I don't care whose father he is!
First, catch hold of him!

2375
01:56:52,012 --> 01:56:52,512
Come on!

2376
01:56:57,676 --> 01:56:59,583
-He's escaping! Follow him!
-He's trying to escape

2377
01:56:59,661 --> 01:57:00,528
Get into the vehicle!

2378
01:57:02,778 --> 01:57:04,997
-What's up? Special rituals?
-Go ahead, upstairs

2379
01:57:06,074 --> 01:57:06,754
See you

2380
01:57:08,034 --> 01:57:10,651
The cost of rituals as per temple's
policy is only five rupees

2381
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:15,346
But in the name of special rituals
he collects Rs. 500 per person

2382
01:57:15,792 --> 01:57:17,459
He built a big house at Nanganallur

2383
01:57:17,561 --> 01:57:19,084
Didn't even invite me for
the house warming ceremony

2384
01:57:19,106 --> 01:57:22,020
If he had invited, you'd have
went and envied him anyway!

2385
01:57:22,162 --> 01:57:23,935
Priest, I am least bothered
who brought or built what

2386
01:57:23,984 --> 01:57:26,080
-I want to tie the knot. It's getting late
-Let's go!

2387
01:57:29,086 --> 01:57:30,632
He keeps escaping
every single time!

2388
01:57:30,757 --> 01:57:32,633
If I catch him today then today
is the last day of his life!

2389
01:57:37,948 --> 01:57:41,094
Attend the call and tell
them I'm on a chase!

2390
01:57:42,794 --> 01:57:44,365
-Hello
-Hello, it's me Sanku

2391
01:57:44,763 --> 01:57:45,740
Can I speak to boss?

2392
01:57:45,926 --> 01:57:47,082
Well, dude...

2393
01:57:47,754 --> 01:57:48,676
our boss got insulted

2394
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:53,183
"How did black coffee coloured man
like him had a milk coloured son?"

2395
01:57:53,650 --> 01:57:56,548
"Is it really his son
or someone else's?"

2396
01:57:56,579 --> 01:57:57,970
A guy insulted him asking this

2397
01:57:58,103 --> 01:58:00,705
Our boss is chasing him now!

2398
01:58:00,814 --> 01:58:01,478
Look!

2399
01:58:01,971 --> 01:58:03,783
I just asked you to say
that I'm on a chase!

2400
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:05,572
Why do you wanna
insult me like this?

2401
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:07,755
Let this get over and
then I'll deal you!

2402
01:58:07,844 --> 01:58:10,540
He lost his nuts and is more furious
than curious now! Call you later

2403
01:58:12,896 --> 01:58:13,576
Priest...

2404
01:58:13,872 --> 01:58:15,896
it's so jammed! Will we get a slot?

2405
01:58:15,982 --> 01:58:17,950
We shall do it by the
banks of the pond behind

2406
01:58:18,414 --> 01:58:19,961
Usually the last rites are
done there, isn't it?

2407
01:58:20,141 --> 01:58:21,945
Are you the priest who
specialize in last rites?

2408
01:58:23,115 --> 01:58:24,640
At times I perform all the rituals

2409
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:26,758
I even deliver water can from
door to door. Not important!

2410
01:58:26,914 --> 01:58:28,117
Let's find a slot. Come on

2411
01:58:28,133 --> 01:58:29,120
Hey there...

2412
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:31,179
Got any free slots?

2413
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:35,555
The couple I'm supposed to marry
aren't here yet. It's getting late

2414
01:58:35,694 --> 01:58:36,662
Well...

2415
01:58:39,327 --> 01:58:41,621
you're one hell of a crazy priest!

2416
01:58:44,598 --> 01:58:45,394
So...

2417
01:58:46,278 --> 01:58:47,637
the bride eloped away

2418
01:58:48,551 --> 01:58:50,339
The groom attempted suicide

2419
01:58:50,386 --> 01:58:50,886
God!

2420
01:58:50,948 --> 01:58:53,581
This slot is free and
so you may use it

2421
01:58:54,824 --> 01:58:56,535
-Suicide attempt?
-Drats!

2422
01:58:58,313 --> 01:58:58,961
What now?

2423
01:58:59,016 --> 01:58:59,516
Sit down

2424
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,938
You heard him, the groom
attempted suicide

2425
01:59:02,034 --> 01:59:04,056
You want us to use
this cursed slot?

2426
01:59:08,211 --> 01:59:09,398
"44"

2427
01:59:09,555 --> 01:59:11,984
Add 4+4 =8, it's an
auspicious number!

2428
01:59:12,101 --> 01:59:13,757
The slot is not cursed!
Sit down!

2429
01:59:24,837 --> 01:59:26,571
Don't hold back because
it's a temple!

2430
01:59:26,745 --> 01:59:28,260
Just find him!

2431
01:59:32,502 --> 01:59:34,408
I just saw him! Where did he go?

2432
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:37,072
Boss, I shall slit him...

2433
01:59:37,072 --> 01:59:38,713
Shut up and find him! Find him!

2434
01:59:38,751 --> 01:59:39,361
Go! Go!

2435
01:59:39,392 --> 01:59:41,041
My Lord, why did he
come to the temple?

2436
01:59:41,102 --> 01:59:43,079
To beg for alms! Go and get him!

2437
01:59:45,571 --> 01:59:46,618
-My Lord
-What?

2438
01:59:46,649 --> 01:59:47,907
We must finish him off!

2439
01:59:47,907 --> 01:59:49,524
First let me finish you off!

2440
01:59:50,415 --> 01:59:52,657
My Lord, he is not there
amongst the beggars either

2441
01:59:52,687 --> 01:59:54,837
Just look anywhere and everywhere!
Go!

2442
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:07,023
Dear!

2443
02:00:07,906 --> 02:00:09,938
-Me?
-Not you! Him

2444
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:11,220
Dear!

2445
02:00:11,644 --> 02:00:12,503
-Dear!
-Him?

2446
02:00:12,594 --> 02:00:14,015
There he is! He's escaping!

2447
02:00:14,045 --> 02:00:15,313
-There he is! Catch him!
-Dear!

2448
02:00:21,312 --> 02:00:22,632
-Bring the coffee here
-Bring the cof...

2449
02:00:22,671 --> 02:00:23,530
Filter coffee, right?

2450
02:00:25,535 --> 02:00:27,168
-Coffee? I'd like some
-Priest!

2451
02:00:27,457 --> 02:00:29,105
How will you recite mantras
if you're drinking coffee?

2452
02:00:31,068 --> 02:00:33,398
I'm famous for reciting
the mantras in my mind

2453
02:00:33,491 --> 02:00:35,164
But then we can't hear it!

2454
02:00:35,375 --> 02:00:36,875
Like, if you hear it...

2455
02:00:38,117 --> 02:00:39,554
do you think you'll
understand the mantras?

2456
02:00:39,687 --> 02:00:40,966
Don't make me throw tantrums!

2457
02:00:41,022 --> 02:00:42,591
No coffee for you

2458
02:00:43,208 --> 02:00:44,122
Recite the mantras

2459
02:00:44,454 --> 02:00:49,626
(Chanting the same mantras)

2460
02:00:49,939 --> 02:00:52,317
You're repeating the same mantras!
Don't you know anything else?

2461
02:00:54,923 --> 02:00:56,297
Watch, he'll repeat the same thing

2462
02:00:56,337 --> 02:00:58,128
-(Chants same mantras)
-See? Told you!

2463
02:00:58,245 --> 02:00:59,113
Wait

2464
02:01:03,685 --> 02:01:04,388
Move!

2465
02:01:04,419 --> 02:01:06,326
Look at him climbing the
stairs on the wrong side!

2466
02:01:06,365 --> 02:01:07,138
Stop! Don't run!

2467
02:01:07,935 --> 02:01:09,127
Move! Make way!

2468
02:01:09,698 --> 02:01:12,042
Boss, why are you jumping
down and running up?

2469
02:01:12,105 --> 02:01:12,815
Stop!

2470
02:01:12,987 --> 02:01:16,573
(Chanting mantras)

2471
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:19,488
How are you able to recite the
mantras in a fluent manner now?

2472
02:01:19,754 --> 02:01:21,090
My father's on the call

2473
02:01:21,543 --> 02:01:23,473
Do something and get
this done quickly

2474
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:34,314
Who are you? Open the door!

2475
02:01:34,845 --> 02:01:35,945
Open the door!

2476
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,453
-You separated me from your daughter!
-Open! Please!

2477
02:01:39,476 --> 02:01:41,397
At least let them be happy

2478
02:01:41,484 --> 02:01:42,773
Are you here to ruin that too?

2479
02:01:43,593 --> 02:01:44,598
Stay inside!

2480
02:01:44,926 --> 02:01:47,098
Here, distribute the
flowers to everyone

2481
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,269
Welcome

2482
02:01:58,712 --> 02:02:00,470
Issues seems to blow up.
Make it fast

2483
02:02:01,869 --> 02:02:03,005
Tie the knot! Hit the music!

2484
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:07,200
(Chanting mantras)

2485
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:16,697
Stop!

2486
02:02:28,157 --> 02:02:31,983
Please halt the wedding that's
taking place by the pole number 44!

2487
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:41,796
Tie the knot! Hit the music!

2488
02:02:48,045 --> 02:02:50,514
Such a wedding must not
take place in our society!

2489
02:02:50,592 --> 02:02:51,959
I won't let it happen!

2490
02:02:52,678 --> 02:02:54,959
That's him! Fraud!
You tie the knot

2491
02:02:56,061 --> 02:02:58,381
-What are you doing inside?
-Move!

2492
02:03:00,659 --> 02:03:01,339
Make way!

2493
02:03:01,997 --> 02:03:02,849
Stop!

2494
02:03:04,768 --> 02:03:05,565
Dad!

2495
02:03:08,203 --> 02:03:09,133
That's my father

2496
02:03:09,945 --> 02:03:11,375
No! That's my father

2497
02:03:12,243 --> 02:03:13,695
No, he's my father

2498
02:03:13,759 --> 02:03:14,962
Whoa!

2499
02:03:15,195 --> 02:03:19,156
Whose father are you? Why are
you quiet? Just spit the truth!

2500
02:03:20,073 --> 02:03:21,550
That woman in green saree...

2501
02:03:22,003 --> 02:03:23,292
she is my first wife

2502
02:03:25,104 --> 02:03:27,370
-Hold her! Hold her!
-Move! Sprinkle water on her face!

2503
02:03:27,409 --> 02:03:27,909
Mom!

2504
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:32,011
If the woman in green saree is your
first wife then why did she faint?

2505
02:03:32,104 --> 02:03:32,784
Because...

2506
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:34,659
she is my second wife

2507
02:03:36,307 --> 02:03:39,514
-Hold her! Hold her!
-Move! Sprinkle water on her face!

2508
02:03:41,068 --> 02:03:45,318
It's a huge sin to have another
wife and hide it from your wife

2509
02:03:46,076 --> 02:03:47,482
God has taught me a good lesson

2510
02:03:48,041 --> 02:03:51,502
Jeyaraj and Divya are siblings. He's
her brother and she's his sister

2511
02:03:53,705 --> 02:03:55,228
-What?
-Hold her! Hold her!

2512
02:03:55,299 --> 02:03:56,666
Move! Sprinkle water on her face!

2513
02:03:57,057 --> 02:03:58,666
Is that your third wife?

2514
02:04:00,259 --> 02:04:01,275
That's my wife!

2515
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:03,557
Anyone would faint
listening to his story!

2516
02:04:03,643 --> 02:04:04,268
Sorry!

2517
02:04:04,417 --> 02:04:06,956
Dear Rani, wake up! Quick!
We can't trust anybody

2518
02:04:07,073 --> 02:04:08,323
Let's go home at once

2519
02:04:18,696 --> 02:04:19,342
Jeyaraj...

2520
02:04:19,562 --> 02:04:20,500
Dear God!

2521
02:04:27,317 --> 02:04:28,093
Brother...

2522
02:04:29,463 --> 02:04:30,502
I am so happy!

2523
02:04:32,627 --> 02:04:33,401
What's going on?

2524
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,156
Jeyaraj...

2525
02:04:46,402 --> 02:04:47,342
Well, that...

2526
02:04:50,172 --> 02:04:51,937
Stay and ensure this wedding...

2527
02:05:00,912 --> 02:05:03,100
Dear, sit down. Sit down

2528
02:05:03,732 --> 02:05:05,756
Move! Unnecessary people leave!

2529
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,490
Leave!

2530
02:05:07,021 --> 02:05:09,496
-Come on, let's leave
-Don't you steal the fruits!

2531
02:05:13,027 --> 02:05:16,027
Come on, priest! Continue
the rituals! Turn around!

2532
02:05:16,112 --> 02:05:17,097
Turn around or I'll kick you!

2533
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:19,536
Mr. Priest, one punch on your
stomach and you'll bleed!

2534
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:32,453
How dare you betray me?
Where did I fail you?

2535
02:05:33,341 --> 02:05:35,213
-You betrayed me!
-I trusted you!

2536
02:05:35,584 --> 02:05:38,351
-How can you betray me?
-Stop it!

2537
02:05:39,304 --> 02:05:41,070
Why did you stop? You may hit me

2538
02:05:43,218 --> 02:05:45,862
I said she can hit me. If
you think I betrayed you...

2539
02:05:45,925 --> 02:05:48,441
-then what about what you did to me?
-What did I do?

2540
02:05:49,613 --> 02:05:52,675
Who was that guy you were pampering
in the terrace today morning?

2541
02:05:52,832 --> 02:05:56,347
Dear groom, all done?

2542
02:05:56,386 --> 02:05:58,706
-Even the third round of feast is over
-Dear...

2543
02:05:58,831 --> 02:06:02,230
Wait dear. You don't
realize who I am

2544
02:06:02,392 --> 02:06:03,330
Who are you?

2545
02:06:03,394 --> 02:06:05,207
-That's my elder brother
-Elder brother?

2546
02:06:05,457 --> 02:06:06,527
Indeed!

2547
02:06:07,113 --> 02:06:08,582
I am her elder brother!

2548
02:06:08,628 --> 02:06:10,363
Then why he visiting you
in a secret manner?

2549
02:06:10,425 --> 02:06:11,886
Listen carefully, I'll explain

2550
02:06:12,416 --> 02:06:15,309
Our parents passed
away when we were kids

2551
02:06:15,532 --> 02:06:17,720
My brother and I
grew up as orphans

2552
02:06:17,768 --> 02:06:21,963
I often borrow money and go out
of station to blast it all

2553
02:06:22,073 --> 02:06:24,840
He's irresponsible! He drinks
and wanders around like a nomad

2554
02:06:24,887 --> 02:06:28,674
My sister worked as a typist
at the Ponamallee court

2555
02:06:28,941 --> 02:06:31,417
That's when I met you

2556
02:06:32,441 --> 02:06:34,508
I hid the fact that I
had a brother, from you

2557
02:06:35,024 --> 02:06:36,196
Then I settled down with you

2558
02:06:36,235 --> 02:06:39,235
I searched for my sister
everywhere but couldn't find her

2559
02:06:39,321 --> 02:06:41,738
That's when I fell
in love with a girl

2560
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:44,223
We lead a happy family life
and she became pregnant

2561
02:06:44,362 --> 02:06:46,698
It was at the hospital
during her delivery...

2562
02:06:46,987 --> 02:06:48,878
I saw my sister again

2563
02:06:48,948 --> 02:06:50,719
Even she was delivering
a baby that day

2564
02:06:51,086 --> 02:06:53,735
My bad luck, my wife passed
away while giving birth

2565
02:06:53,789 --> 02:06:55,110
My child survived

2566
02:06:55,312 --> 02:06:57,242
My sister's good luck...

2567
02:06:57,390 --> 02:06:59,749
she survived while delivery
but her child passed away

2568
02:07:00,359 --> 02:07:02,312
That's when doctor
gave me an advise

2569
02:07:02,718 --> 02:07:06,523
He said "You're an alcohol addict. So, do
you think you can raise a girl child?"

2570
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:11,531
"You better leave the kid by your
sister and let this baby be hers"

2571
02:07:11,796 --> 02:07:15,718
I felt that was the silver lining in
all of the bad things happening around

2572
02:07:16,084 --> 02:07:20,229
Though this sounds like a cliche,
I promise you this is the truth!

2573
02:07:20,503 --> 02:07:22,449
Divya is my daughter

2574
02:07:23,956 --> 02:07:25,050
So, I can marry Divya?

2575
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:28,021
Yes! You can marry Divya!

2576
02:07:28,022 --> 02:07:29,652
You doofus!

2577
02:07:29,691 --> 02:07:31,300
Where do you guys
even turn up from?

2578
02:07:31,331 --> 02:07:34,870
Won't you change this last
minute cliched twist?

2579
02:07:35,302 --> 02:07:37,755
Stop it! Stop it!

2580
02:07:37,781 --> 02:07:38,731
Stop it!

2581
02:07:38,802 --> 02:07:40,622
Why does the groom look
like he took bath in tar?

2582
02:07:40,645 --> 02:07:44,661
You're my lucky charm! 44, split
an add and it gives eight

2583
02:07:44,676 --> 02:07:46,373
Money's pouring on my plate!

2584
02:07:47,684 --> 02:07:49,115
You're indeed my lucky charm!

2585
02:07:49,255 --> 02:07:50,649
Let me fire up you palm!

2586
02:07:51,664 --> 02:07:52,164
Dear!

2587
02:07:52,961 --> 02:07:54,758
Boss, now that the
wedding is over...

2588
02:07:54,812 --> 02:07:56,703
let's do the "feeding the
couple with sweet" ceremony

2589
02:08:03,785 --> 02:08:04,410
Give it to me

2590
02:08:05,411 --> 02:08:07,051
-All good!
-Drink it, groom!

2591
02:08:07,956 --> 02:08:09,816
-Don't feel shy
-Here, drink it dear

2592
02:08:16,074 --> 02:08:17,074
Dear...

2593
02:08:17,877 --> 02:08:19,800
please don't confuse them further

2594
02:08:20,925 --> 02:08:21,596
Who?

2595
02:08:22,441 --> 02:08:23,167
Me?

2596
02:08:23,792 --> 02:08:25,534
You 'Round-the-clock' drunkard!

2597
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:28,626
You came all the way from
Kottampatti to confuse me...

2598
02:08:28,690 --> 02:08:30,969
and now you're asking me
not to confuse anyone?

2599
02:08:34,362 --> 02:08:36,344
Don't look for me anywhere...

2600
02:08:37,802 --> 02:08:39,231
I am heading to the bar!

2601
02:08:39,302 --> 02:08:41,326
Dear! I'll also join you!

2602
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:45,583
(Finally moving on after getting
destructed and depressed)

2603
02:08:48,049 --> 02:08:48,886
I’m unable to sing

2604
02:08:49,128 --> 02:08:51,097
All these words like Love and
Marriage is driving me furious

2605
02:08:51,105 --> 02:08:53,174
-Here, you guys manage. I'll go have something
-Bro, what happened?

2606
02:08:53,194 --> 02:08:53,694
Bro?

2607
02:08:53,723 --> 02:08:55,411
Brother, why feeling?

2608
02:08:56,035 --> 02:08:56,755
Love feeling

2609
02:08:57,364 --> 02:08:58,293
Shall I tell you something

2610
02:08:58,380 --> 02:09:00,913
You came all the way. Aren't
not gonna say if I say no?

2611
02:09:00,982 --> 02:09:01,513
Tell me

2612
02:09:02,012 --> 02:09:04,809
If you switch on the fan and expect
the TV to play, will it play?

2613
02:09:05,232 --> 02:09:06,060
Life is very similar

2614
02:09:06,123 --> 02:09:08,466
-Forget everything and happily...
-Please, I'll sing

2615
02:09:08,724 --> 02:09:10,529
Quit advising. Okay?

2616
02:09:10,606 --> 02:09:12,432
Remember the steps I taught
you? Go and dance properly

2617
02:09:12,739 --> 02:09:14,761
Steps? Right!

2618
02:09:15,792 --> 02:09:17,324
-Ready guys?
-Ready bro!

2619
02:09:17,354 --> 02:09:19,121

to get rid of me"

2645
02:10:43,602 --> 02:10:46,384

Climb up the tree"

Convince her by buying her gifts"

Please mend it; where's the medicine?"

Get lost! Leave me!"

-You sing really well
-Thanks

2671

So, love failure?

2672
02:12:19,664 --> 02:12:22,430
What is it? Don't I look
like a girlfriend material?

2673
02:12:26,193 --> 02:12:28,255
Let's leave. Pack everything

2674
02:12:30,216 --> 02:12:31,176
Where are you put up?

If I'm right, then...

2685
02:12:50,661 --> 02:12:51,560
She's trying to woo our bro

2686
02:12:54,388 --> 02:12:55,810
That's him with the spectacles

2687
02:12:56,029 --> 02:12:56,529
Dad!

2688
02:12:56,568 --> 02:12:57,357
Why are you late?

Won't you let me live in peace?

2694
02:13:20,134 --> 02:13:21,102
Damn it!

2695
02:13:21,218 --> 02:13:21,968
Uh-oh!
