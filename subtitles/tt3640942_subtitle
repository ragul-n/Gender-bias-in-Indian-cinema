1
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,929
The owners..

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,891
...didn't just control
these mine fields.. -Hurry up..

3
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,720
"but also the labors living here.

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,168
Even after 26 years of independence..

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,802
Unscientific mining..

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,324
...poor working
conditions of the labors..

7
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,449
...and extreme exploitation of labors..

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,731
..forced the government
to form the Coal Mine Act.

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,362
But on 1st May 1973 the
government centralized all mines..

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,282
..and took over them.

11
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,724
But the real owners..

12
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,329
..were not ready to
give up this black diamond..

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,845
...and lose their
authority over it. Coal..

14
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,042
So, in order to
maintain their authority.

15
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,530
..they discovered
new means to exercise it.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,884
And thus came in
existence, India's most notorious mafia.

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,166
Coal Mafia.

18
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,963
There's just one mafia in this country.

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,164
And that's the Indian Government.

20
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,281
And we're the ones..

21
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,010
..who protect Koye
aancha
..

22
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,445
..from the government mafia.

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,610
Because I know this is Koyelaanchal.

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,609
If you walk with your eyes open..

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,404
..your eyes will be filled with coal.

26
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,881
Try closing your eyes
and you'll be covered in coal.

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,410
The government servants.

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,968
..need my permission to load the coal.

29
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,361
Load it up, rascals,
what are you all staring at?

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,927
Here's the delivery
order. Don't you get it?

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,851
Your government papers are no use to us.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,726
Your DO comes from
my government, not yours.

33
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,081
Get that?

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,405
You simply pass a
delivery order from Delhi..

35
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,725
..and say "Go take
coal from Koyelaanchal‘.

36
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,326
'This isn't social justice.'

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,041
'The poor and backward
people of KoyelaanchaL. '

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,328
Raise their voice
against this through me.'

39
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,847
Why can't I load my coal in my truck?

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,410
Who says you can't?

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,761
Go ahead.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,325
Just pay manpower difference..

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,767
..of the poor and backward.

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Lallan. -Yes.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,326
Make a difference receipt for him. -Yes.

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,890
Don't look at me, I am not on duty.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,488
I would like to talk
to the officer on duty.

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,688
This is the authority here, sir.

49
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
Would you like a word?

50
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,611
But remember.. his word is final.

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,931
Absolutely final.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,446
'We protect government officers.. '

53
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,761
From inflation to Maoists.'

54
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,683
'That's why from the
officer at weighing depot.. '

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,560
To the guard at the
check post works only for me.'

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,126
Sir..

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,204
...I'll be really grateful
if you ready my papers soon.

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,205
If I can leave in daylight.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,004
...I won't have to pass
through the barricades at night.

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,769
If everyone leaves in the day..

61
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,002
..then what about the
guards that patrol at night?

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,560
But I've completed
all the formalities here.

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,047
The boss will be the judge of that.

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,244
One needs to give
many things other than coal.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,001
We've to answer to the masters, not you.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,206
Come on, seal you truck and get going.

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,081
'The government often keeps.. '

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,249
Transferring officers here.. '

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,322
To liberate Koyelaanchal from me.'

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,047
'It doesn't even make me laugh now.'

71
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,961
Rajapur's getting a new Collector.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,241
Many have come and gone.

73
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,971
If you try to meet them"

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,203
"you'll have to wait all
day at the Collector's Office.

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,126
Just see, his name
will get published soon.

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,009
They say he's a big righteous.

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,730
He's received training abroad.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,411
That's right.

79
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,642
We've sc***d our own people enough.

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,487
Now we should get
to sc**w some foreigners.

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,050
'The world's running because.. '

82
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,208
People believe God exists.'

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,370
'Koye
aancha
's running because.. '

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,803
People know.. their Master's there.'

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,329
'Saryu Bhan Singh.'

86
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,883
Master looks restless.

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,325
Lord have mercy.

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,291
The Master's
getting a divine revelation.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,246
You weren't there..

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,169
That was when Rajiv Gandhi was murdered.

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,242
That day the Master
was restless just like this.

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,003
Karua isn't in Rajapur.

93
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,361
That's the only reason.

94
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,484
The Master's all alone..

95
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
What is it, Sadhu?

96
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,284
Nothing.. l..

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,847
I was just telling
the guards to be more alert.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,402
Why hasn't the manager arrived yet?

99
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,842
He'll be here soon.

100
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,090
I've sent the car to the station.

101
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,608
There was a time"

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,680
..when only the
Masters would travel in cars.

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,402
But now.. everyone
thinks he's the master.

104
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,642
Everyone.. except for the labor.

105
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,729
Tea, please.

106
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,211
I think the Manager's back. -I guess.

107
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,442
Mr. Manager.

108
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,048
It's been 35 years since
the Master became the government..

109
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,684
..and the manager became the collector.

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,487
But your mentality hasn't changed.

111
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,924
The officer's aren't
getting f***d, you all are.

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,645
The people of Koyelaanchal.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,048
And all because of your mentality.

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,323
Understand. Manager!

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,201
Ghosh, there's no place
for such discussions at my shop.

116
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,646
If someone's blood boils up..

117
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,042
..how will I feed my family?

118
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,728
Think about the country.

119
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,244
Troubles are coming this way.

120
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,571
Clouds of destruction
are hovering over us all.

121
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,531
If you don't find your ground..

122
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,528
"You'll perish forever.

123
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,044
And even history will forget your story.

124
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,687
Get the ball.

125
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,686
Run! Run!

126
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,211
This is the beginning..

127
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,568
..of Suryu Bhan's end.

128
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,729
Wake up people of Koyelaanchal.

129
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,291
This is the time"

130
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,610
..to speak up to the Collector.

131
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,610
Back in Raniganj..

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,809
"the Opposition
have made a separate union..

133
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,569
"apart from the Masters.

134
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,410
We'll form one too.

135
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,210
That's how we'll bring revolution.

136
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,568
Long live Revolution!

137
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,048
Long live Revolution!

138
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,601
Move back!

139
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,766
Move back! Move back!

140
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,683
Hey you.. Move back!

141
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,565
Stand there quietly.

142
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,444
Come in when I call.

143
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,241
How many cases?

144
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,401
Not much.

145
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,445
I'll finish everything in 2 hours.

146
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,285
The rates have been revised.

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,169
Ghanshyam will give
you the details. Get it.

148
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,611
And no one argues.

149
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,370
It was revised just last month.

150
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,366
Who said that?

151
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,766
Long live Revolution!

152
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,127
Long live Revolution!

153
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,123
Long live Revolution!

154
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,043
Long live" -Labor Union!

155
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,884
Long live Revolution!

156
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,803
Long live" -Labor Union!

157
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,803
Long live Revolution!

158
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,121
Long live" -Labor Union!

159
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,804
Long live Revolution!

160
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,962
Long live" -Labor Union!

161
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,088
Long live Revolution!

162
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,607
These worms have grown wings.

163
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,123
Long live" -Labor Union!

164
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,851
Without caring about anything"

165
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,081
..show them that Saryu Bhan Singh..

166
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,889
"won't be scared by a few dead bodies.

167
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,129
Long live" -Labor Union!

168
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,446
Stay there.

169
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,521
I am coming.

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,968
Long live" -Labor Union!

171
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,769
Long live Revolution!

172
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,484
Long live" -Labor Union!

173
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,244
Long live Revolution!

174
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,845
"I am a labor."

175
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,490
"I am a labor."

176
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,324
"Helpless by habit."

177
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,811
"Helpless by habit."

178
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,088
Uncle, there's am
ambience of disturbance building up.

179
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,969
"I am a labor."

180
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,527
Why did Ghosh have to pick up the mike?

181
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,523
I don't think we can
get into the manor alive.

182
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,766
What do we do?

183
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,250
Uncle, run. -Yes.

184
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,205
Hurry up, uncle. -Yes. Give me a hand.

185
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,727
Are you going to act
when he hurls a bomb at us?

186
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,691
This isn't your cup of tea.

187
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,726
Uncle!

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,571
Jha, get these bodies out of there.

189
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,126
Sir, we recovered these
two hand-made bombs and a gun.

190
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,323
But I heard that
they were on that tree..

191
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,091
..when the shots were fired.

192
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,687
Maybe, sir.

193
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,725
You can't trust these extremists, sir.

194
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,047
That means they were shot on that tree.

195
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,888
And they fell inside the manor, Jha.

196
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,361
Them.

197
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,209
They are Maoists, sir.

198
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,564
They get shot in
China, but die on our land.

199
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,006
In India.

200
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,685
This two feet
distance is irrelevant, sir.

201
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,930
They kill or get killed anywhere.

202
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,321
Master.

203
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,770
The manager's here.

204
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,244
The new Collector.

205
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,485
You've arrived at a time"

206
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,368
..when I can't show you my hospitality.

207
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,241
Well..

208
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,362
...I had few questions myself.

209
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,406
Unfortunately.

210
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,081
Anyway.

211
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,291
..some other time.

212
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,964
All your life you were like a relief.

213
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,445
But your death is a burden on me.

214
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,327
Friendship is more
dangerous than enmity.

215
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,481
Right, Sadhu.

216
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,044
Let's call Karua, master.

217
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,685
We've kept silent for a long time.

218
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,361
But the rascals have
a whiff of his absence.

219
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,731
A small bird.

220
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,331
One Scarecrow.

221
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,201
The rascal managed to
create a stir in Rajapur.

222
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,161
It's more important to put a leash..

223
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,090
..on Vidrohi of Raniganj.

224
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,282
He's stirred up this storm.

225
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,926
He's the one.

226
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,523
"Gentleman, Pandit and Yadav."

227
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,610
"First I greet everyone."

228
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,325
Bless you!

229
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,450
"Now turn your eyes and take a look."

230
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,725
"Take a good look at my beauty."

231
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,490
"How do I go.. "

232
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,050
"How do I go.. "

233
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,049
"How do I go to Jhariya."

234
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,731
"My life's in trouble."

235
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,442
"You look delicious."

236
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,843
"How do I go.. " -"How do I go.. "

237
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,450
"How do I go to Jhariya."

238
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,490
"My life's in trouble."

239
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,290
"Everyone" ".

240
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,044
"Everyone tries to touch me."

241
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,169
"They all have cruel intentions."

242
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,084
"They come close and say.. "

243
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,005
"They come close and say.. "

244
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,923
"You're number one."

245
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,207
"Your beauty's.. "

246
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,642
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

247
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,883
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

248
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,203
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

249
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,523
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

250
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,127
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

251
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,051
10 Rs from lrshad
Tailor, Delhi return. Dhambad Road.

252
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,924
Please give your money in round figures.

253
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,570
It takes time for counting.

254
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,803
Ram Avtar, Confectioner. Purani Puliya.

255
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,880
Rani Ganj Coal Committee.

256
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,730
..extends their gratitude to you.

257
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,564
"Doctor, engineer, builder."

258
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,730
"I am everyone's darling."

259
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,366
"They call me
everyday.. and say good morning."

260
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,001
"I've connections..
with big politicians."

261
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,686
"My program is what
makes them win election."

262
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,969
"But I don't react on their injection."

263
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,202
"Not one or two.. "

264
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,768
"Not one or two.. I take eleven."

265
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,049
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

266
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,363
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

267
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,683
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

268
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,969
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

269
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,283
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

270
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,965
"Your beauty's like AK-47."

271
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,167
Hello.

272
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,806
Calm down.

273
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,287
We'll have to take a small break.

274
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,360
We're fortunate that
Koye
aancha
's messiah..

275
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,525
..Govardhan Das Vidrohi has arrived.

276
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,251
I would like to
request the people of Raniganj..

277
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,962
..to give a warm
welcome to this brave warrior.

278
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,280
Be quiet.

279
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,485
Don't worry.

280
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,881
I won't spoil your fun. -Listen to him.

281
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,881
I'll finish my speech with a few lines..

282
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,804
..from Pakistani
poet's Ahmed Farhaz's sonnet.

283
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,008
"I guess my enemy didn't imagine.. "

284
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,926
That the lamp.. "

285
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,803
"The storm of death."

286
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,047
"The storm of death
can fire up the lamp."

287
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,163
"They have
confidence on their brutality."

288
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,760
"His pride.. "

289
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,001
"they have confidence on
their brutality, I have faith that."

290
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,087
"The hands raised
for truth are stronger.."

291
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,083
"..than the hands raised to kill."

292
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,728
"My executioner is probably not aware."

293
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,171
"This heart can beat in
the hands of a killer as well."

294
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,961
"A dear is caught in
the midst of cannibals."

295
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,122
The program's over, boy.

296
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,928
Didn't you see your boss?

297
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,844
Get out of there. Now.

298
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,050
"The sun has to shine."

299
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,410
"The ambience has
to change at any cost."

300
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,803
Hey, where do you think you are going?

301
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,606
Karua.

302
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,885
Saryu Bhan's most ferocious killer.

303
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,882
He's shown great honor
by sending you to kill me.

304
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,488
The labor's voice can
be suppressed but not killed.

305
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,525
By killing Vidrohi..

306
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,571
..your master cannot
suppress this revolution.

307
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,966
Vishnu, what is it?

308
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,731
Vishnu, be quiet.

309
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,644
Vishnu, I told you to be quiet.

310
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,126
Let go.

311
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,601
I'll be right back.

312
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,721
Vishnu..

313
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,161
You?

314
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,806
When did you return?

315
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,770
I didn't know you're coming.

316
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,689
The Toll Collection officer's inside.

317
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,886
Wait, I'll be right back.

318
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,961
I'll be right back.

319
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,005
Karua. Karua, wait.

320
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,840
No, dear. No.

321
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,640
Here.

322
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,885
Don't pay heed to him.

323
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,288
He's been wronged by God, just like you.

324
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,730
Hey, hello. How are you?

325
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,686
Great. So, what's the latest?

326
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,721
Latest?

327
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,405
You wouldn't want to hear it.

328
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,529
When are you leaving? -Saturday.

329
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,930
Saturday? Why not tomorrow?

330
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,169
Nimesh still has to be given two drops.

331
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,446
And mom's saying that.

332
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,005
...I should leave only
after completing the entire course.

333
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,280
Better. Better. Better.

334
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,723
Listen, is there a good hospital around.

335
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,485
The place is plagued with diseases.

336
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,125
So there's bound to be a hospital.

337
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,606
Nimesh is up, I'll call you later.

338
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,251
Fine, call me.

339
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,447
Bye.

340
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,681
Bye.

341
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,562
Due to the heavy massacre..

342
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,563
..in Jharkhand's Rajapur district.

343
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,286
"the situation's quite tensed.

344
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,602
Since Koye
aancha
's the hometown"

345
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,808
..of Saryu Bhan Singh, the attack..

346
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,930
..by Rajapur's labors and Maoists.

347
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,961
..is being considered as
a challenge to his authority.

348
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,403
Other than Saryu Bhan Singh's kin..

349
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,608
..and his former
Minister, he also lost"

350
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,206
"most of his
workers in his union office..

351
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,284
Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind.

352
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,486
Where's the SHO?

353
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,649
SHO sir hasn't arrived yet.

354
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,609
He always comes in late.

355
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,444
A big incident took place yesterday.

356
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,924
How can he sleep?

357
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,730
Tell him I was here. -Yes, sir.

358
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,881
Let's go.

359
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,249
This is a big challenge
for the new district collector.

360
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,290
He calls
yesterday's incident a big deal.

361
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,806
What will he call
what's going to happen tomorrow?

362
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,089
The king of all incidents.

363
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,682
So what were you saying, Captain?

364
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,044
I was saying this is
Bhusan Santa
i's doing.

365
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,402
He called in shooter's from Ranchi..

366
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,043
..and together executed this plans.

367
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,686
I had a doubt. it was Bhusan.

368
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,208
He's using our tricks on us.

369
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,408
He thinks he's a leader of the Dalits.

370
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,645
Son..

371
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,168
..you don't blame the gun..

372
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,241
"but the one who fires for the murders.

373
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,804
If Bhusan's the
gun, then who is using him?

374
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,169
This is a very high-class game.

375
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,008
I just told you what was useful to you.

376
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,045
Let me decide what's useful to me.

377
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,041
Only me.

378
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,527
I've vowed to put an end to the law..

379
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,721
"that you swore to protect.

380
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,846
What did you think?

381
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,009
Without a reason.

382
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,210
You do know Darbanga's Narsu.

383
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,047
He's in jail. For a year.

384
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,880
Even you're in jail.. officially.

385
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,361
Idiot.

386
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,245
Last year Narsu spent a lot of money.

387
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,009
In Lucknow, Patna and Ranchi.

388
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,131
This time the people believe".

389
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,128
...he'll definitely get
a ticket for the elections.

390
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,051
Other than the Minority"

391
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,369
..he has an eye on the Dalit votes.

392
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,689
And this is why
Bhusan's goons support him.

393
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,968
And you do know, if people like him..

394
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,047
..get their hands on
money, how haughty they get.

395
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,245
And as far as the labor
leader Ghosh is concerned.

396
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,243
I'll.. stick this up
his back whenever you say.

397
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,647
If you do everything.

398
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,360
..then you'll be
burdened with work Lord.

399
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,685
God's there.

400
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,684
To keep an account of
everyone's merits and sins.

401
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,840
Son, it's time for my prayers.

402
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,810
Go and play.

403
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,801
Praise the lord!

404
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,163
He isn't at home.

405
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,207
If you show courage, then"

406
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,965
"the rest of the
Koye
aancha
's unions will join us.

407
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,481
They own.. the weighing depot.

408
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,604
They scam.. the DO.

409
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,723
Now they own the Unions too.

410
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,843
This isn't dictatorship.

411
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,410
This won't do.

412
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,051
This won't do.

413
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,370
We'll have to tell
them.. that we aren't alone.

414
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,565
Everyone's with us.

415
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,208
Many people are with us.

416
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,767
We can stand up to them.

417
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,691
'Lal Salaam' (Red Salute).

418
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,804
Nasru.. or everyone!

419
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,281
Massage.

420
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,808
Lord dwells in the heart.

421
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,483
Glory to Lord Ram!

422
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,205
Forgive me, Lord!

423
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,966
Forgive me.

424
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,969
People of Maharashtra.

425
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,362
..in association of
people of Bihar presents"

426
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,245
..Jharia, a Comedy of Fire.

427
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,721
A film by Bhudbhak Bhansali.

428
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,247
A very goodnight to all the ladies..

429
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,766
..and gentlemen all over the world.

430
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,242
Welcome to the funniest place on earth"

431
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,164
...called Jharia.

432
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,170
This is Boka Pahadi Village in the back.

433
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,763
You can see the
smoke coming from under..

434
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,687
..because whole
Jharia's been burning since 1914.

435
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,409
But.. people still live here.

436
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,648
That's why it is funny.

437
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,642
Please.. listen to
the modern music of Jharia.

438
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,926
This is called
'Khasi Music' (Cough Music).

439
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,490
Because everyone here
has Asthma and Lung disease.

440
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,450
..due to smoke and coal dust.

441
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,729
This beautiful girl's name is Kalpana.

442
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,801
I asked her 5 months ago.

443
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,489
I guess.. you want
to be Aishwarya Rai. -No.

444
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,245
I want to be Kalpana Chawla.

445
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,323
Wow! Bravo.

446
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,291
She wants to become Kalpana Chawla.

447
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,323
Lady. Space traveler.

448
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,847
But Kalpana Chawla died in space.

449
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,845
This Kalpana will get buried here.

450
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,686
Trust me.. here is her house.

451
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,004
When the earth cracks,
she will get buried under here.

452
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,164
Jharia is a very funny place.

453
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,683
It's keep her people grounded.

454
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,569
Here earth cracked suddenly.

455
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,251
Because people take coal from under..

456
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,243
..and don't fill the hollow gap.

457
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,323
They are happy with money.

458
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,411
Poor life of 4 lakh
poor people of Jharia.

459
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,764
Government want to shift
these people, but they say..

460
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,490
We're fine.

461
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,130
We're not in any danger.

462
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,601
The government only
wants to drive us away.

463
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,045
They want to drive us out"

464
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,090
..and take authority over this place.

465
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,161
We won't leave our lands.

466
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,048
This is just the trailer.

467
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,802
To watch the full movie,
at a reasonable price contact.

471
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,600
Remember.

472
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,362
It is a Budbhak Bhansali Presentation.

473
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,002
Who is Budbhak Bhansali?

474
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,726
That's me.

475
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,729
I was ruined trying to make..

476
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,322
...the Bhojpuri remake
of 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.

477
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,248
Since then people gave me this name.

478
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,569
We're artists.

479
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,689
All we want is to get famous.

480
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,411
Doesn't matter by which name.

481
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,248
But this is a serious matter, so..

482
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,211
No one takes Biharis and
Jharkhandis seriously, sir.

483
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,960
Our songs, food,
movies, atrocities, life, death"

484
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,884
..has become an international joke.

485
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,963
A politician has
presented this country like ajester.

486
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,451
I've invested money,
so I want to recover that.

487
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,324
And.. I've also put
in Tribal women dance..

488
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,890
..in few intervals.

489
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,006
They are dancing without a blouse..

490
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,605
..on a hot ground.

491
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,650
And that increased sales.

492
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,485
Why don't you spare some time, sir?

493
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,529
I want to show you the entire film.

494
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,011
No, no. No need for that.

495
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,204
I completely
understand what you want to convey.

496
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,090
lam working on the same issue.

497
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,325
Sir, my motive behind
showing you the film was..

498
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,004
You must have understood"

499
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,889
"that I've made this film with..

500
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,128
..the international
audience in mind. -Yes.

501
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,044
I wish for an Oscar
Award, sir. -Oh, good!

502
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,727
If you liked it,
please recommend it to Delhi.

503
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,524
Yes. -If not in the country"

504
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,046
..maybe I'll get some respect outside.

505
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,806
Please spare some
time to watch the film.

506
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,291
Yes, of course.

507
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,930
Okay.. see you.

508
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,048
The girl.. Kalpana.

509
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,851
She was my daughter.

510
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,690
That's where my house was.

511
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,726
Imagine sir, it's so difficult.

512
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,725
..to stand there and laugh.

513
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,521
I am sorry.

514
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,284
See you, sir.

515
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,244
Get me the file on Mine Filling Scams.

516
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,606
Yes, sir.

517
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,121
And fix a meeting with
Saryu Bhan Singh, right now.

518
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,281
Okay, sir.

519
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,451
Hello.

520
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,011
Come.

521
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,764
Let's talk in the open field.

522
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,245
This isn't the place
for the district Collector..

523
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,211
..and a former Ruler to meet.

524
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,085
Are you scared?

525
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,209
Your company's filled this mine.

526
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,809
You must have
sealed it with sand properly.

527
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,365
So why be scared?

528
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,323
Come sit in the car.

529
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,891
Fine, as you wish Saryu Bhan.

530
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,481
Karua.

531
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,724
Follow us in the officer's car.

532
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,283
You're new here.

533
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,806
You must want to know about me.

534
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,641
I've heard a lot about it.

535
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,924
After you mine coal from these mines..

536
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,281
..it's important to be filled properly.

537
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,521
It is. It's important.

538
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,529
And your company gets
all the contracts for filling.

539
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,211
Who can know
Koyelaanchal better than me?

540
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,926
Yes.

541
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,443
And that's why, when you
should be using 200 trucks of sand..

542
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,882
..you don't even use 100.

543
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,408
Do you realize how
hazardous this can be..

544
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,689
..for normal life and the environment?

545
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,005
You will understand.

546
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,085
You will understand gradually.

547
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,325
Towards the Weighing depot.

548
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:16,165
Saryu Bhan, you
should 210 trucks of sand..

549
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,562
...in mine no 34114.

550
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,842
And this truck 3222,
made 16 trips in 24 hours.

551
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,727
If you get sand from Ganga Ghat..

552
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,646
..this distance takes 2 hours.

553
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,484
And loading-unloading is separate.

554
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,651
There might be a
mistake in the accounts.

555
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,844
We'll sit down and rectify it.

556
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,805
You see.. the
educated people left this place.

557
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,403
Delhi, Mumbai.. America.

558
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,929
And those who are
here.. make mistakes. What to do?

559
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,805
Yes, Saryu Bhan.

560
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,969
This is why the
educated people don't stay here.

561
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,407
The mistake of violating the law.

562
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,162
This place is an ecological disaster.

563
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,447
A human disaster. Do you understand?

564
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,442
Where do you hail from?

565
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,121
What?

566
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,648
I mean.. hometown.

567
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,605
Samistipur.

568
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,645
Samistipur.

569
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,885
It feels really good..

570
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:37,409
..when I hear a
Bihari speak such good English.

571
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,284
I feel proud.

572
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,006
Master.

573
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,011
Master. I beg your forgiveness.

574
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,811
I made a grave mistake.

575
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,727
Master, I'll accept any punishment.

576
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,770
Just forgive me.

577
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,529
Everyone was high
for the last three days.

578
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,720
But after Ghosh died,
everyone's back to normal.

579
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,645
These labors..

580
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,284
They care about no one.

581
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,643
They understand just one language.

582
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,731
Violence.

583
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,686
Violence.

584
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,764
Forgive me.

585
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,130
Take a look.. it's before your eyes.

586
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,684
Now you decide who is responsible..

587
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,923
..for disrupting the law the order here.

588
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,800
I had lost my mind.

589
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,966
I did it on Nasru saying.

590
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,006
It's that same rascal..

591
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,171
..who wrote those
abusing words for Master that day.

592
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,728
Now that he's scared for his life..

593
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,724
..he's begging in front of Master.

594
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,170
How did he escape you?

595
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,290
Karua. -Karua, let go.

596
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,771
Karua.

597
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,440
Stop, Karua.

598
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,643
Stop, Karua.

599
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,566
Karua.

600
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,281
Get out of my sight. now.

601
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,011
Stupid!

602
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,041
Serves him right, sir.

603
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,324
The rascal was a big nuisance.

604
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,641
No..

605
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,201
"whatever"

606
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,722
..he shouldn't have
taken the law in his hands.

607
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,926
The son's blood is ought to boil..

608
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,721
..if his father's abused.

609
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,686
Just forget what you saw, Mr.Collector.

610
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,689
No will talk about this in Koyelaanchal.

611
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,123
This is my promise to you.

612
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,401
Feeling better.

613
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,920
Yeah, yeah, come.

614
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,161
Come, come, sit, sit, sit.

615
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,290
Anything bothering you, sweetheart?

616
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,241
No.

617
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,721
Actually, yes.

618
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,442
I shouldn't have called you two here.

619
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,081
Why?

620
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,971
Fear of love and
loathing in Eastern India.

621
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,766
It wasn't that.

622
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,644
This place is unbelievable.

623
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,886
A man was brutally
murdered before my eyes.

624
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,445
The government,
people, police just watched.

625
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,241
Neetu.

626
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,045
Neetu I don't know who I need to reform.

627
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,450
Where do I begin?

628
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,884
Who do I begin with?

629
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,928
And against whom?

630
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,127
And what price should I be ready to pay?

631
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,361
Are you scared? -Aren't you scared?

632
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,129
Once a woman returns
alive from the labor room..

633
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,931
..she forsakes all fear.

634
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,967
The fear and pain in the
labor room teaches you one thing.

635
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,288
If you want new hope in life..

636
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,451
"then you have to go through some pain.

637
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,251
Nimesh is awake.

638
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,084
Go. -I'll be right back. Move.

639
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,925
Coming, son.

640
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,645
Coming.

641
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,721
Your name in the Mine Filling case..

642
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,491
..and Karua in Bhusan's
murder case have been brought up.

643
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,281
So?

644
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,849
So.. I'll have to lodge an FIR.

645
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,521
So go ahead.

646
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,122
Until now there were 422.

647
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,765
Now there will be 423.

648
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,005
I'll have to show an arrest.

649
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,121
Who?

650
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,043
Are you dreaming?

651
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,240
The Collector was the
eye-witness in Karua's case.

652
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,970
Didn't your Collector
puke at the Weighing depot?

653
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,202
I guess.. if I make
him s**t in his pants..

654
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,725
...he'll know what Karua is.

655
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,247
Go on.

656
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,288
I'll handle this matter myself.

657
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,367
Bless you.

658
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,641
Karua..

659
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,681
Son.

660
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,730
Now.. listen carefully
to what I say and understand.

661
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,444
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I ran into Mishra.

662
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,568
And you got an
excuse to drink another peg.

663
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,325
Absolutely right.

664
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,131
I was in the mood
to be drunk today, and..

665
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,284
And? This is the last
time we come here for dinner.

666
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,370
The food's so tasteless.

667
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,849
I'll ready my kitchen tomorrow.

668
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,323
And you keep at least 2 hours for me.

669
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,011
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

670
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,044
I'll do the grocery shopping
myself tomorrow. -Ok. Shall we go?

671
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,247
Shall we go?

672
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,681
What's this?

673
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,087
The District
Collector's going to Drink and Drive.

674
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,368
Come here, I'll drive.

675
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,920
Superb! No problem.

676
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,729
New chauffeur.

677
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,404
Driver cum wife.

678
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,370
Excuse me, you
forgot to sign the logbook.

679
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,881
No, no, I'm coming.

680
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,883
I'll just go sign the logbook.

681
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,200
Give me a minute. -Okay.

682
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,401
Yes.

683
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,249
'You don't have to
kill him, just scare him.'

684
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,642
'He should see his death.'

685
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,884
No, no.

686
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,246
Nisheeth!

687
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,567
Nisheeth! Help.

688
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,641
Meetu.

689
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,601
'Be careful, son..
there's no room for mistake.'

690
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,165
Stop!

691
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,609
'If anything goes wrong,
it will add to my troubles.'

692
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,165
Stop! Stop! -He got away.

693
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,201
Car..

694
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,408
Stop" -Stop the car.

695
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,001
Follow him.

696
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,806
Meetu.

697
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,441
Someone..

698
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,484
Someone call the ambulance.

699
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,721
Meetu.

700
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,924
Someone call the doctor.

701
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,890
Someone call the ambulance. Please.

702
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,601
Meetu.

703
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,971
Please call the doctor.

704
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,248
Call the doctor.

705
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,961
Greetings.

706
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,807
Karua, are you fine?

707
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,641
I am fine, master.

708
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,640
What happened, son?

709
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,925
Even after I explained you.

710
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,362
I did what you said.

711
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,369
I didn't tell you
to shoot the Collector.

712
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,646
I didn't shoot him.

713
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,563
But how did his wife
get so seriously injured?

714
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,051
It's her fault.

715
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,083
Karua, you don't know
what mess you've put me into.

716
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,481
Listen.

717
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,848
Now stay quietly in RaniGanj.

718
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,281
Yes, Master.

719
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,126
If anyone abuses me
or pees on my picture.

720
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,526
You won't do anything.

721
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,324
If I hear anything about you..

722
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,049
"then I won't forgive you.

723
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,401
Karua.

724
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,606
Karua.

725
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,885
What's that noise?

726
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,887
The Collector's child is in the car.

727
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,605
Collector's child?

728
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,406
Where are you?

729
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,566
In the jungle.

730
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,601
How old is the child?

731
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,166
I don't know.

732
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,687
Listen.. don't leave
the child there to die.

733
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,961
Yes, master.

734
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,487
I've heard that the Collector..

735
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,570
..was blessed with a child
after lot of effort and prayer.

736
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,731
Keep the child safe, get it.

737
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,921
Yes, master.

738
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,684
And throw your phone away.

739
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,081
Throw it right there.

740
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,403
I'll tell you what
next when the time comes.

741
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,601
Yes, Master.

742
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,288
Quiet!

743
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,361
Oh, God!

744
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,648
Don't kill me. It's me.

745
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,801
Shambhu.

746
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,405
Master has sent a message.

747
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,770
The child shouldn't die.

748
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,885
He's dead.

749
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,086
Dead?

750
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,482
Oh, God! I am dead.

751
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,043
Now I'll be blamed for it.

752
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,448
I delayed in
delivering the message and..

753
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,800
Oh, God!

754
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,201
Why?

755
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,807
I've made 20 trips to your home.

756
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,560
My stomach was murmuring.

757
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,489
I just went to the
fields to relieve myself".

758
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,609
..and you messed things up.

759
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,207
What's my fault?
Tell me.. is it my fault?

760
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,371
Where is he?

761
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,840
He's alive.

762
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,925
Your prank has given me loose motions.

763
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,485
Look after him.

764
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,962
I'll tell the
master "Message Delivered".

765
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,921
lam going.. the
pressure's building up again.

766
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,889
Water" it's there.

767
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,401
Hey"

768

Here..

769
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,361
Quiet!

770
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,529
"Shoot the brain."

771
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,689
"It makes a racket."

772
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,368
"Shoot the brain."

773
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,529
"It makes a racket."

774
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,884
"The brain will get you killed, Ka

u."

775
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,366
"The brain will get you killed, Ka

u."

776
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,645
"You'll do and
others will pay, Ka

u.. "

777
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,765
Quiet!

778
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,050
ls this okay for reference?

779
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,046
What is this?

780
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,920
Sketch?

781
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,681
What do I do with this?

782
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,928
Everyone knows him here.

783
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,402
Every damn cop in
every damn police station.

784
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,209
But no one will do anything about it.

785
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,247
Because.. their
interest lies in acting unknown.

786
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,881
Sir.

787
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,163
We're not looking for a roadside thug.

788
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,090
This is a mission to find the roots"

789
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,165
..of the 150 year terror
spread through Koyelaanchal.

790
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,289
All this is bu

s**t.

791
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,720
Bloody. .

792
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,926
Sir, if you know how many officers..

793
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,560
..from your own force support you..

794
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,640
"then you will be scared.

795
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,368
There's a team coming
from the Centre, Nisheeth.

796
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,050
Now they will be handling this case.

797
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,242
The fear of death
and protection of keen..

798
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,720
..are things no corruption can surpass.

799
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,046
But this time"

800
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,529
..they cannot escape so easily.

801
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,720
What about my son?

802
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,050
The hunt is on, Nisheeth.
Don't worry, they will not harm him.

803
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,603
His safety is the only way out for them.

804
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,561
It's an extremely
volatile situation, Nisheeth.

805
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,083
We've to deal with is smartly.

806
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,082
Whatever be the outcome, Nisheeth..

807
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,165
..it will seal the fate
of democracy in this region.

808
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,971
Forever.

809
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,010
This revolution could be initiated"

810
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,931
"only when democracy
took a blow to its head.

811
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,323
Unfortunately, it was your head.

812
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,371
He}! gorgeous.

813
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,606
There's not a
single fish better than you..

814
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,163
..in these waters of Raniganj.

815
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,368
I just yearn in loneliness.

816
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,724
But I didn't say anything to you.

817
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,641
Take your hands off.

818
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,049
Talk rubbish to your wife.

819
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,050
I don't want your fish.

820
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,246
What happened?

821
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,489
Take the fish.

822
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,406
Oh, God!

823
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,041
Hey"

824
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,845
He's caught a cold lying on the ground.

825
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,923
He's a child, not othenlvise..

826
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,164
My child..

827
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,848
Do what you brought him here for.

828
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,403
But don't call me again for him.

829
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,684
I might be a prostitute in your view..

830
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,131
"but, I am a woman and a mother.

831
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,964
I can't have a stern heart like yours.

832
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,524
Kill him, strangle
him, do what your master says.

833
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,644
But keep him away from me.

834
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,651
Have mercy on me.

835
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,566
I beg you.

836
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,326
Wretch!

837
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,367

838
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,921
Yes.

839
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,009
He lives abroad.

840
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,530
400,000.

841
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,003
Entire Koyelaanchal
are like his children.

842
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,084
Come. The master has
called you to the cowshed.

843
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,567
Master.

844
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,405
Just two minutes.

845
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,806
The calf has hurt his leg.

846
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,925
I wonder how.

847
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,607
Bravo, son.

848
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,248
So you've all been sent from Delhi.

849
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,486
Yes.

850
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,685
Because the administration here..

851
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,171
..is in your pocket.

852
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,366
Like your wounded calf.

853
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,765
No, that's not true.

854
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:02,047
But.. look at howl
take care of my children.

855
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,811
I've heard that you've
many children to look after.

856
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,605
Give us one.

857
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,806
Just one.

858
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,686
Karua.

859
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,165
You are..

NB-.

861
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,083
And anyway.. this Sadhu Singh..

862
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:36,370
"doesn't let us set foot in your area.

863
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,930
So.. I came here
with special permission.

864
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,361
From Delhi.

865
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,008
Are you here to search my house?

866
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,605
N0. no. no, no.

867
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,410
I know he isn't here.

868
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,723
We'll find out where he is.

869
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,808
May God help you.

870
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,561
Dear..

871
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,847
You pray to God as well.

872
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,645
You pray to God as well.

873
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,249
Because I've set
out to catch a mad dog..

874
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,608
"but it might lead to you.

875
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,289
This time the situation's very serious.

876
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,642
Tolerate only those..

877
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,089
..who cooperate.

878
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,369
So the dog named karua..

879
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:18,724
ls he a member of
your special squad as well?

880

Since when did reporters"

01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,120

Go on.. and make your case against me.

Assaulting an on-duty officer.

886
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,929
Then I'll show you what.

887
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,409
"trespassing means.

888
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,930
Sadhu. -Master.

889
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,691
Thank you so much, Mr. Saryu Bhan.

890
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,730
For the slap.

891
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,849
Bureaucracy was in deep slumber here.

892
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,604
The one who put it to sleep..

893
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,849
..has always awakened it.

894
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,365
I like it.

895
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,565
Very nice.

896
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,768
The camera's turned off, mister.

897
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,209
No need for this drama and dialogues.

898
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,567
You might have set out in your uniform..

899
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,526
"but you'll be sent back
wrapped in the tricolor flag.

900

This coal city.

901

Don't hope to take anything from here..

902
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,127
"except for the black mark.

903
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,046
I am so sorry, Nisheeth.

904
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,006
I made a mistake. I made a big mistake.

905
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,970
You see.. I had to make
our bosses in Delhi realize..

906
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,404
"that we're dealing with a big enemy.

907
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,323
It's difficult to win this war..

908
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,609
"without winning
the people's confidence.

909
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,410
lyer, you weren't
sent here to win a war..

910
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,608
..or start a war.

911
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,651
You're here for my son.

912
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,684
You've been sent here from Delhi..

913
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,728
..to find the kidnapers of my son.

914
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,365
Very good, Nisheeth.

915
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,765
That's nice.

916
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,285
So now it's all about your son.

917
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,365
Your son?

918
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,244
What about those who
were brutally murdered?

919
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,410
Burnt alive.

920
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,721
Blown up.. Just for your son!

921
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,406
Yes, it is also about my son, dammit.

922
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,568
It is also about my son.

923
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,604
Because the one who's murdering..

924
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,884
..and burning people alive has my son.

925
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,885
You bloody fool!

926
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,005
He's the Don here.

927
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,885
He owns this land you're standing on.

928
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,521
Lye r.

929
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,041
You like being a media star, don't you?

930
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,525
You will get other opportunities.

931
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,443
Please not at the cost of my son.

932
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,970
Not at the cost of the innocent child.

933
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,171
Sonny. Come on.

934
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,050
Sonny.

935
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,407
Sonny.

936
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,768
Sonny. Come on.

937
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,006
Come on.

938
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,408
Sonny. -Sonny.

939
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,601
Come.

940
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,250
Sonny.

941
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,769
Look here.

942
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,881
Sonny.

943
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,441
What is it?

944
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,847
Food.. for you.

945
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,964
Sonny. -Sonny.

946
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,491
Come.

947
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,641
Come.

948
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,001
Sonny.

949
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,970
Don't cry.

950
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,691
Sonny. Come.

951
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,806
Sonny. Come.

952
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,042
Come..

953
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,566
Here.. No, no, eat it.

954
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,008
Ask his papa his name.

955
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,850
I won't. You ask him.

956
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,730
Ask him sissy.

957
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,689
What's his name?

958
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,124
What's his name?

959
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,761
Uncle, what's his name?

960
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,730
She was asking, not me.

961
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,923
He says he hasn't named him yet.

962
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,571
Can I call him Shahrukh?

963
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,120
He's fair like Shahrukh.

964
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,651
I won't ask.

965
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,927
Go ask him sissy.

966
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,207
Uncle, can we call him Shahrukh Khan?

967
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,809
Can we call him Shahrukh Khan?

968
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,881
Uncle.

969
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,685
Not me.. it's her.

970
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,285
He says it's okay.

971
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,569
Eat it, my Shahrukh.

972
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,080
Shahrukh. Shahrukh.

973
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,969
Eat, Shahrukh.

974
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,727
Come home.. when the kid's asleep.

975
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,601
Karua.

976
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,569
Return him to whomever he belongs.

977
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,529
How many more
curses are you going to take?

978
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,409
He's made you commit sins..

979
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,009
..and poses as an austere himself.

980
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,086
The scoundrel of Rajapur.

981
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,929
Do you know the worth of each gun?

982
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,328
It's not more than my brother's life.

983
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,808
Brother's life or the right of the poor.

984
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,921
Your brother got
scared by a single blow..

985
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,367
..and went to plead for his life.

986
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,410
That was Bhusan, I am Puran.

987
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,960
We might look alike, but"

988
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,085
..you will gradually
understand the difference between us.

989
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,206
Bravo. Now you sound like a Comrade.

990
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,566
To hell with your Comrades.

991
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,728
This is about the poor.

992
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,564
And don't try to show
that you're doing a favor on me.

993
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,890
No one cares for the poor
without any selfish motives.

994
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,046
Not even God.

995
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,490
The thing is that.

996
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,162
..you stand to get gain from me..

997
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,488
"that's why you're spending on these.

998
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,042
But I have nothing to lose.

999
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,771
SO I will fight.

1000
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,166
Have you seen him?

1001
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,128
This man with a smiling face?

1002
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,886
No, mister.

1003
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,570
I swear I haven't.

1004
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,761
Okay.

1005
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,521
Naughty-

1006
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,089
'Come here.'

1007
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,286
'Come here.'

1008
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:41,852
Shahkukh. Don't cry.

1009
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,566
Shahkukh. Don't cry.

1010
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,089
Shahkukh.

1011
01:23:48,201 --> 01:23:49,885
Want a toffee?

1012
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,121
Here.

1013
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,924
Shahrukh.

1014
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,242
Want a toffee?

1015
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,241
Shahrukh. -Hey. Leave.

1016
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,881
I brought a toffee for Shahrukh.

1017
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:02,730
Shahrukh.

1018
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,844
Want a toffee?

1019
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,921
See.. he's saying he wants it.

1020
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,641
Shahrukh.

1021
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,401
Shahrukh.

1022
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,007
'Karua, the boy shouldn't die.'

1023
01:24:53,161 --> 01:24:54,322
'Get it.'

1024
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,761
What?

1025
01:25:00,841 --> 01:25:02,172
Let's go.

1026
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,681
Why?

1027
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:06,810
The child.. -I won't go.

1028
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,281
Come with me. -Let go.

1029
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,762
Let me go. Let me go.

1030
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,241
Why do drag me into this?

1031
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,085
If you're so worried for him..

1032
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,844
..then return him to his mother.

1033
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,371
Otherwise go call the one..

1034
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:21,324
..who made you commit this sin.

1035
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,686
Butchers.

1036
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,202
Hit me. -Hit me.

1037
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,321
I won't go.

1038
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,607
You've killed many people.

1039
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,961
Kill me too.

1040
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,161
Come on.

1041
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,407
Beat this wench to death.

1042
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,290
Come on. Hit me.

1043
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,488
Why don't you hit me? Hit me.

1044
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,681
Quiet!

1045
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,086
"The cloud of love."

1046
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,964
"Knows no weather."

1047
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,486
"The cloud of love."

1048
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,331
"The cloud of love."

1049
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,811
"Knows no weather."

1050
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,201
"The heart.. "

1051
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,642
Does as it wants."

1052
01:27:43,721 --> 01:27:47,646
"The cloud of love."

1053
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,562
There's Someone higher than your master.

1054
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,964
Do a good deed in His view.

1055
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,971
Who knows.. maybe it
will wash away your sins.

1056
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,201
Don't separate the
child from his mother..

1057
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:07,848
..."The cloud of love."

1058
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,771
"Knows no weather."

1059
01:28:13,161 --> 01:28:17,610
"The heart.. "

1060
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,249
Does as it wants."

1061
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,287
"The cloud of love."

1062
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,370
"Knows no weather."

1063
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:43,283
"My heart does as it pleases."

1064
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:48,730
"The cloud of love."

1065
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,964
What were you saying?

1066
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:06,092
Nothing.

1067
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,571
I was saying..

1068
01:29:07,881 --> 01:29:11,203
...please make my
daughter's birth certificate.

1069
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,404
I'll be grateful.

1070
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,528
What will be the father's name?

1071
01:29:17,481 --> 01:29:18,846
Put in your name.

1072
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,680
You've been coming
here before she was born.

1073
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:23,612
What did you say?

1074
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,166
Nothing.. I was just joking.

1075
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,601
Know your limits.

1076
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,446
And here's your fee.

1077
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,605
Your job will be
done when the time comes.

1078
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,528
Hey, naughty.

1079
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:04,681
Say Papa-

1080
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,609
Say papa. -Say papa.

1081
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,371
Come here. Come here.

1082
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,687
Say Papa-

1083
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,569
Say Papa-

1084
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,006
Say Papa-

1085
01:30:15,081 --> 01:30:16,082
Say Papa-

1086
01:30:16,361 --> 01:30:18,284
You won't say it.

1087
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,805
Papa. Papa--

1088
01:30:20,201 --> 01:30:23,125
Say mama.

1089
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,726
Naughty-

1090
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,691
Ma.. -Ma.. Ma.. No.. !

1091
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,842
Come here..

1092
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,841
Yes.

1093
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,011
<i>Yes, wet.</i>

1094
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,321
Nisheeth here.

1095
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,531
I need to setup a meeting
as soon as possible, please.

1096
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,324
Let's all face the
facts and accept that..

1097
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,125
..we've been complete failures
when it comes to Saryu Bhan Singh.

1098
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,609
So far we've been
able to achieve nothing.

1099
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,328
Saryu Bhan Singh is above the law.

1100
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,367
We need to destroy this myth.

1101
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,011
40 years in this business.

1102
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,770
And not arrested even once.

1103
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,487
What else will people
think of him if not a don?

1104
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,641
A bloody criminal.

1105
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,085
A third grade bloody criminal.

1106
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,722
I studied every case of his inside-out.

1107
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,601
He's never involved directly.

1108
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,167
For example, take the mine-filing scam.

1109
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:15,961
We can get a warrant
on Mahavir Earth Shakers.

1110
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,363
But according to the company documents.

1111
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,811
"the owner is Vinay Kanojia.

1112
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,886
His driver.

1113
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,040
We can arrest. but Vinay Kanojia.

1114
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,842
Same bloody problem in every damn case.

1115
01:32:31,081 --> 01:32:33,163
Even if we arrest him on this case..

1116
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,847
...he'll get bail within 24 hours.

1117
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,606
And then"

1118
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,604
The situation can get worse.

1119
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,841
Excuse me, sir.

1120
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,002
To discuss on how to restore"

1121
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,688
...law and order in a small city".

1122
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,644
...the Inspector General of Police..

1123
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,049
...Director General of Police..

1124
01:32:57,961 --> 01:33:00,567
..District
Collector, District Magistrate..

1125
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:04,004
..
nte

igence are meeting secretly"

1126
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,130
..in the pool room of a club.

1127
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,250
How much worse can the situation get?

1128
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:18,927
If you want honey..

1129
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,049
..you have to stick
your hand in the beehive.

1130
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,045
Just once, sir.

1131
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,250
Just once.

1132
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,127
We need to cuff that
rascal Saryu Bhan Singh..

1133
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:36,889
..and trot him around entire Rajapur.

1134
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:44,680
I challenge.. everyone will speak up.

1135
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,809
But how will you do it?

1136
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,970
Wait till sunset.

1137
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,321
Let the court close.

1138
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,409
Tomorrow and the day after is a holiday.

1139
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,766
And then Sunday.

1140
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,610
In three days we've to
change Koye
aancha
's history.

1141
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:05,323
We'll dare.. and the
sacred Cows will help us.

1142
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,241
Careful.

1143
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,805
What's going on here?

1144
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,124
Sadhu, what's happening?

1145
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,689
They're testing our patience.

1146
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,643
Mr. Collector, what's your problem?

1147
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,888
I don't, but these
poor, helpless animals do.

1148
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,565
We're here to rescue them.

1149
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,687
What?

1150
01:34:53,920 --> 01:35:00,326
Did my cows lodge an FIR?

1151
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,366
No.

1152
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,686
A we're taking this action"

1153
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,964
...on a senior bureaucrat's complaint.

1154
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:13,564
I guess you know Mr. lyer.

1155
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,290
Mr. lyer, come.

1156
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,006
Come.

1157
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,121
Senior bureaucrat, Mr. Kanan lyer.

1158
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:26,370
You've kept your
animals in a pathetic condition.

1159
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:30,361
So many animals in a small cowshed.

1160
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:34,327
No place to sit, stand or even breathe.

1161
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,921
See.. your animals are also hurt.

1162
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:42,044
And.. the feeding
arrangements are also bad.

1163
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,685
And you know..

1164
01:35:44,681 --> 01:35:47,764
We found this
medicine from your cowshed.

1165
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,370
This medicine is banned by the WHO.

1166
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,171
What new law are you trying to teach me?

1167
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,322
This law is called..

1168
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:04,050
Prevention of Cruelty
Against Animal Act.. 1960.

1169
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,483
The one's you're calling animals..

1170
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,561
..are dear to me like my children.

1171
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:16,647
And then" how long can
you keep them away from me?

1172
01:36:19,561 --> 01:36:21,609
It will take at least 3 days.

1173
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,646
But that's okay.

1174
01:36:23,721 --> 01:36:26,247
You can file an
affidavit in the court after that.

1175
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,564
You will have to
pay a fine of 2000-3000.

1176
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,566
After that. your
children will be free.. and you too.

1177
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,606
Me too?

1178
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,001
Meaning?

1179
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,402
It means we're arresting you under..

1180
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,650
"Prevention of Cruelty
Against Animal Act.. 1960.

1181
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,929
Rascal.. how dare you cuff your master.

1182
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,163
I'll erase you from
existence" or my name isn't"

1183
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,527
You can name your pet after me.

1184
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,726
You don't know..

1185
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,882
"what a dire step you're taking.

1186
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,850
It will burn.. Rajapur will burn!

1187
01:39:43,721 --> 01:39:46,725
Why has Saryu Bhan been arrested?

1188
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,201
Would you like to
comment on your arrest?

1189
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,886
Do you think by arresting Saryu Bhan..

1190
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,570
..you can eradicate
crime from Koyelaanchal.

1191
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,490
Do you think there's a
political conspiracy behind your arrest.

1192
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,366
Nobody could arrest Saryu
Bhan until now. -No comments please.

1193
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:00,846
How did you succeed?

1194
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,085
Please help us.

1195
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,561
No comments. -ls it
a political conspiracy?

1196
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,123
The police and
administration are hesitating to comment.

1197
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,924
..on Saryu Bhan's arrest.

1198
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,526
People are calling Saryu Bhan's arrest.

1199
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,730
..the government's
action against the coal mafia.

1200
01:40:23,081 --> 01:40:26,324
Why are you telecasting wrong news?

1201
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:28,332
Along with my master..

1202
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,926
"they have also arrested my cows.

1203
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,331
Cows? -Yes.

1204
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,769
Now tell me.. how are
the cows related to the mafia?

1205
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,002
He's been arrested because..

1206
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:41,406
"My cowshed is too small..

1207
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,041
Hey"

1208
01:40:44,201 --> 01:40:46,010
What" do you think?

1209
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,209
Was Saryu Bhan Singh
arrested because of the cows?

1210
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,804
You wait here.

1211
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,688
Sadho, it's a minor case.
-We'll get bail from the station.

1212
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,290
Talk to the SP.

1213
01:41:06,601 --> 01:41:09,730
I'll talk to him
when he answers my phone.

1214
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,641
They must have kept him occupied.

1215
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:16,049
Listen. Tell sir Sadho's here.

1216
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,170
Sir's on a leave.

1217
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,880
He'll be back on Monday.

1218
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,047
Leave?

1219
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,811
He was on duty in the morning.

1220
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,166
He talked to me.

1221
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,051
He's the senior officer.

1222
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,640
No one knows when
he comes or what he does.

1223
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,131
Want some tobacco.

1224
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,721
Give me your phone. He
isn't answering my phone.

1225
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,124
What are you doing? Hurry up.

1226
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,281
Here.

1227
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:44,003
Hello. -Sinha, why
aren't you answering my call?

1228
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,929
Who is speaking? -Who is speaking?

01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,641
Your father" Sadho Singh.

1230
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,449
Sadho who? -Sadho who?

1231
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,041
What happened?

1232
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,767
He hung UP!

1233
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,486
Don't worry, sir.

1234
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,728
You won't be kept in a ordinary cell.

1235
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,843
We've made special arrangements for you.

1236
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:10,650
And then.. we've no intentions..

1237
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,006

01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,761
lyer sir. -Yes.

1239
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,490
There should be no physical torture.

1240
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,561
Yes.

1241
01:42:17,641 --> 01:42:18,722
Come.

1242
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,281
Sit.

1243
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,165
lyer, won't you offer him water.

1244
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,530

01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,760
sorry"

1246
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,084
Sorry.. Saryu Bhan..

1247
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,571
Mr. Saryu Bhan.

1248
01:42:58,601 --> 01:43:00,126
Lord..

1249
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:50,090
No one should know
anything about the master.

1250
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,400
Absolutely no one.

1251
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,482
Especially Karua.

1252
01:43:53,641 --> 01:43:56,167
Karua. Leave everyone.

1253
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,209
Come on. -Go.

1254
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,287
Run.

1255
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,446
What happened, brother?

1256
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,527
Hello, brother.

1257
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:03,727
ls everything fine?

1258
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,051
Did someone give you any news?

1259
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,605
I mean absurd.

1260
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:09,566
You came on time.

1261
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,770
I was on my way to the mines.

1262
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,524
They'll be distributing salaries today.

1263
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,370
So.. it's important for me to be there.

1264
01:44:15,721 --> 01:44:17,883
These labors have
no rules, you know that.

1265
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,051
These labors. They are a big..

1266
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,526
What happened?

1267
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,688
Brother. Master's absolutely fine.

1268
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,241
You're fine too. I am fine too.

1269
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,004
Everyone's fine.

1270
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,921
Come.

1271
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:47,209
I didn't expect you to stoop so low.

1272
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,571
Lower than kidnapping a baby.

1273
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,730
Give me your phone.

1274
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,962
Let me answer this call.

1275
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,963
I don't want my people..

1276
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,883
..to get agitated without a reason.

1277
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,126
It's for your own good.

1278
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,800
Yes, Shambhu.

1279
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,326
Greetings.

1280
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,964
I told you not to call.

1281
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,724
Master, I want to see you.

1282
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,686
Not possible.

1283
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,966
What are my orders?

1284
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:39,681
Look after yourself.

1285
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,766
It's for your own and my good.

1286
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,480
Give me your phone.

1287
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,481
Thank you.

1288
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,087
Uncle, I gave Shahrukh a bath.

1289
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:08,322
Look at how handsome he's looking.

1290
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,402
Uncle, didn't you
teach him to wash his s**t.

1291
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,166
That's because he's still small.

1292
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,369
No, no, no..

1293
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,401
Here.. here..

1294
01:46:24,681 --> 01:46:26,968
Shahrukh.

1295
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,049
Uncle, where's his mother?

1296
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,686
Uncle.

1297
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,002
You don't speak at all.

1298
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,201
In the city.

1299
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,203
Even my father lives in the city.

1300
01:46:42,281 --> 01:46:44,170
Have you seen him?

1301
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:48,690
She's lying. Her father is dead.

1302
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,569
What are you whispering?

1303
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:52,970
I was asking should I teach"

1304
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,964
..Shahrukh the song we learnt in school?

1305
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,884
Uncle says I can.

1306
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:01,044
Fish is the queen of the water.

1307
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:04,203
Water is her life.. -No,
no, he'll learn my father's poem.

1308
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:05,805
Right, Shahrukh Khan.

1309
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,842
My detractors never thought perhaps.

1310
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,520
That I am the lamp that
good survive the winds of death.

1311
01:47:14,601 --> 01:47:18,526
That I am the lamp that
good survive the winds of death.

1312
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,202
My father will get me a new frock today.

1313
01:47:22,281 --> 01:47:24,124
My father too.

1314
01:47:24,201 --> 01:47:27,091
Liar. I know he isn't coming.

1315
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,288
A goon killed him.

1316
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:34,611
Your master cannot suppress
this revolution by killing rebels.

1317
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,164
Be quiet, my father will come.

1318
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:41,121
Liar. I know he isn't
coming. A goon killed him.

1319
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,282
Your father will forget
everything after he's drunk.

1320
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,805
And he won't get you anything.

1321
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,405
My father doesn't forget.

1322
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,007
Workers' voice can be
suppressed, but can't be killed.

1323
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:58,649
Your Master can't suppress
revolution by killing the rebels.

1324
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,043
Your father's a wretch. He
won't get you anything you b****.

1325
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,610
She's a liar.

1326
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,524
My father will bring a frock.

1327
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:13,521
Uncle, tell my father to get my frock.

1328
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,364
His name is..

1329
01:48:15,401 --> 01:48:16,846
Mayku Bhuiyaan.

1330
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,089
Write 200 Rs against my name. -200?

1331
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,088
Pay 500. -500?

1332
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,284
Do you have a problem?

1333
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,605
I'm paying. Here's
500. Give me a receipt.

1334
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,161
Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind.
-Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

1335
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,531
Morning.

1336
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,964
Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

1337
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,201
Morning, lyer. -Morning, Nisheeth.

1338
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,890
Your love-letter has arrived.

1339
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,689
I guess mine's on the way.

1340
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,127
These are Saryu
Bhan's bail papers, right?

1341
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,201
Yes, sir.

1342
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,486
Okay.

1343
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,003
Hey, Nisheeth, good to see you buddy.

1344
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,970
I was waiting for you.

1345
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:45,841
Sorry.

1346
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,524
I started using your office..

1347
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,649
"without completing the formalities.

1348
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:53,249
I hope you
understand" and you won't mind it.

1349
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:57,492
Hey.. which formality?

1350
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,011
What formality?

1351
01:49:59,081 --> 01:50:02,767
The orders has
arrived.. that you're the Collector.

1352
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,485
Then that's final.

1353
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,324
Hold on, Sadho sir. Hold on.

1354
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,524
Nisheeth, I just got
these orders few hours back..

1355
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,365
..to take charge immediately.

1356
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,765
And.. your..

1357
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,365
Your..

1358
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,251
This is your transfer orders.

1359
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,883
I was asked to hand it over personally.

1360
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,243
You know how these
things happen sometimes.

1361
01:50:23,721 --> 01:50:24,722
No.

1362
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,409
No, Sharma, I don't
understand why these things happen.

1363
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:33,763
I don't understand
why these happen sometimes.

1364
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,004
But with an honest officer..

1365
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,323
"this happens all the time.

1366
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,410
Always" some Khemka
is transferred 40 times..

1367
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,323
...in his 20 year career.

1368
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,286
Some Durgashakti gets suspended..

1369
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:49,210
"without prior notice.

1370
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,726
Why?

1371
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,043
The Supreme Court keeps coaxing you..

1372
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,202
..to bring the Civil
Services act but you don't listen.

1373
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,562
They tell you to fix a
minimum tenure for officers..

1374
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:01,170
"but you don't listen. Why?

1375
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,130
Because you want to
blindly follow orders.

1376
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,887
If you want to bully
us around, do it openly.

1377
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,200
Why do you put our honor,
dedication and life at stake?

1378
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,802
I was clearly given in writing"

1379
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:18,407
..to go in that
region and create a normalcy.

1380
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,809
Deal with nuisance elements.

1381
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,888
And eliminate if required.

1382
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,770
So that's what I am doing.

1383
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,402
Then why suddenly am I a nuisance?

1384
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:35,371
I am sorry, Sharma, I do not understand.

1385
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:39,646
And now I do not
want to understand period.

1386
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,566
See..

1387
01:51:44,681 --> 01:51:46,888
..he's getting so restless.

1388
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:49,403
It's because he tightened our grip.

1389
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,203
He dared to touch my master.

1390
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,201
I'll kill him in..

1391
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,328
Please. Please, Sadho. Please.

1392
01:51:59,401 --> 01:52:01,847
Nisheeth, don't make it personal.

1393
01:52:01,961 --> 01:52:03,451
What rubbish, Sharma.

1394
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:06,601
I put everything at stake in this war.

1395
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,404
My life, my career, my family.

1396
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,921
Even my kid. And you're
saying don't make it personal.

1397
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,041
Have you f**** lost it.

1398
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,481
The kid will come
back, Nisheeth. He'll come.

1399
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,848
lam your friend, your colleague.

1400
01:52:17,001 --> 01:52:20,562
Try and understand one thing.

1401
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,291
It's always about the normalcy".

1402
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:25,284
..about their relationship
over here and those in power in there.

1403
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:26,971
It's always about those in power there..

1404
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,411
..and those in power over here.

1405
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,403
That bond is solid.
That bond is not broken.

1406
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,807
Nothing is broken. So
you don't need to fix it.

1407
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:35,491
I care a f*** about their
f**** bond with these criminals.

1408
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,522
I care a f*** about
their attitude towards us.

1409
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,762
<i>Their W“ greed.
Their W“ ‘rndrﬁerences.</i>

1410
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,524
Their f***** double-standards.

1411
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,729
What-s this .l.-**** going on?

1412
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,801
Sharma, I hope you know..

1413
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,609
"the meaning of a conspiracy.

1414
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,325
Don't act smart with
us. -I am not acting smart.

1415
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,528
Then talk in Hindi. Hindi.

1416
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,761
In our mother tongue.

1417
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,171
So that I can understand too.

1418
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:00,766
I was trying to explain Nisheeth..

1419
01:53:00,841 --> 01:53:03,492
..that he can get
his kid back if he leaves.

1420
01:53:03,721 --> 01:53:06,167
The
Administration.. -To hell with his kid.

1421
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,410
My master's being
tortured for the past 48 hours.

1422
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,922
Don't give me that look.

1423
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,766
You have no value here.

1424
01:53:17,161 --> 01:53:18,686
Take your wife and get out of here.

1425
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,802
Shut the f*** up. Shut up.

1426
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,284
Collector, you..

1427
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,441
Stay down.

1428
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,608
I said f**** stay down!

1429
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,324
Sir, you're the Collector and..

1430
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:52,008
Hey lawyer: I am
still the Collector here.

1431
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,489
I haven't received his orders..

1432
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,882
..or handed over my charge.

1433
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:01,166
This is my office, and
its filled with scam files..

1434
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:06,203
..and your witness is the prime suspect.

1435
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,491
I hope you know the
meaning of armed intrusion.

1436
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,121
Sharma. Better explain him.

1437
01:54:15,401 --> 01:54:17,563
As district
Collector what powers I have..

1438
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,202
..to safeguard my sphere of duty.

1439
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,160
Or do I explain him? -I get it.

1440
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,965
Come on, Sadhu sir.
It's best to leave from here.

1441
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,122
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, Sadhu sir.

1442
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,441
This Collector has lost his mind.

1443
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,485
Sir, technically speaking..

1444
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,248
lam on indefinite leave.

1445
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,601
I can't take anyone's charge..

1446
01:54:52,521 --> 01:54:57,004
..or handover anyone's transfer orders.

1447
01:54:59,881 --> 01:55:02,248
And you're free to
take any action you like.

1448
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:04,171
Sharma.

1449
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,888
Thank you. -Hope not to see you.

1450
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,240
It was Saryu Bhan's time to die.

1451
01:55:26,761 --> 01:55:28,411
But took him instead. -Meaning.

1452
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,289
It means.. if we had
taken Saryu Bhan tonight.

1453
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,483
..then this
would've been his last night.

1454
01:55:38,281 --> 01:55:43,321
We've information that the
tribal descendants plan to attack..

1455
01:55:43,401 --> 01:55:45,324
..his master Saryu
Bhan Singh's empire today.

1456
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,367
When did you get this information?

1457
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,761
Yeste rd ay.

1458
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,167
And you're telling me today, lyer.

1459
01:56:00,681 --> 01:56:05,164
I know.. the
situation can get out of control.

1460
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:09,042
It's better to stay quiet
instead of alerting the system.

1461
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,922
You know this better.

1462
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,923
But those" who are
losing their innocent kin..

1463
01:56:14,761 --> 01:56:17,844
..in this violence won't understand.

1464
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,607
I did this for your son.

1465
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,001
What will you tell Meetu?

1466
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,411
Where's Nimesh?

1467
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,410
I'll tell her..

1468
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,484
I'll tell her that he's dead.

1469
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:37,327
It's easier than saying that.

1470
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,843
...I killed the law to save my son.

1471
01:56:45,801 --> 01:56:47,405
Everyone is informed that.

1472
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:51,087
..Maoist attacked on
Rajapur's Naya Mod police station.

1473
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:55,364
The entire district
is under Maoist attack.

1474
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,683
The people believe
this incident is the result..

1475
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,364
..of the government's effort on..

1476
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,687
"putting a leash on the coal mafia.

1477
01:57:43,081 --> 01:57:46,528
The chief of one of the
labor union in this area told us..

1478
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,010
This was bound to happen.

1479
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,923
If you can't protect us..

1480
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,968
..then we'll have to protect ourselves.

1481
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,808
This attack is a
fitting reply from the tribal..

1482
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,083
And if this continues,
then the coal mafia will soon..

1483
01:58:16,361 --> 01:58:17,522
Hi, Nisheeth.

1484
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:40,881
Look, sir.

1485
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,689
We made their leader surrender as well.

1486
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,730
The battle is won at least.

1487
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:50,524
Who won or lost
doesn't make a difference.

1488
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,489
We lost our people on both sides.

1489
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,240
Poor Indians.

1490
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:57,849
So what's the point of this victory?

1491
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,641
Someday people will
sing praises of Puran Santhali.

1492
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:02,881
Understand.

1493
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,843
And anyway, I've made your job easier.

1494
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,282
Explain them my value.

1495
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,842
They are dragging me like an animal.

1496
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,525
I've been trying to explain them.

1497
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,721
Sir.

1498
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,649
I think we need him at the press-con.

1499
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,284
Master told me to keep this from you.

1500
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,081
You're the master's
honor, you're his pride.

1501
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,091
His last hope.

1502
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,928
He didn't want to put you in danger.

1503
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,771
Master has lived all
his life for his honor.

1504
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,962
He even refused to
recognize his son's body.

1505
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,602
To show that no one can murder..

1506
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,524
..Saryu Bhan Singh's son.

1507
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:07,124
He hasn't even
performed the final rites.

1508
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,685
One has to say that the
young master's lives abroad.

1509
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,121
What to do?

1510
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:15,645
It's the question of master's honor.

1511
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:19,212
40 years.

1512
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,050
I've kept the master's
honor intact for 40 years.

1513
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,210
Time's changing.

1514
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:31,043
The master's been damned.

1515
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,285
The effect's going to show.

1516
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,131
If they master stays alive".

1517
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:40,364
...he'll never be able to tolerate it.

1518
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,842
The master's lived
all his life with pride..

1519
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,003
..so send him away similarly.

1520
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,682
Give him salvation.

1521
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:57,162
If he dies by your
hand, he'll be immortal.

1522
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,363
One Karua kills the other"

1523
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,484
..it doesn't look good.

1524
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,650
<i>He's a mad ha“</i>

1525
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,243
Nisheeth.. we cannot
negotiate with these people.

1526
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,686
Except for death.

1527
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,768
lam the administrative
head of this district, sir.

1528
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,200
Collector.

1529
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:19,808
Still I'm letting him use me..

1530
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,723
..for my own personal interest.

1531
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,643
What message will
the people get from this?

1532
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,009
Do you think I am being selfish?

1533
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:35,284
In the last 24 hours 113 soldiers died.

1534
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:40,848
Even we are normal people with family.

1535
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,971
This message should
be delivered to the people.

1536
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:49,001
Otherwise they will either
consider us God or the devil.

1537
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:53,647
I am as strong as you are.

1538
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:56,890
I am as helpless as you are.

1539
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,490
Try to understand.

1540
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,570
Help us.

1541
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,963
This message should
be delivered to the people.

1542
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:15,364
Give me strength, Goddess.

1543
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:47,724
Why did he call us here?

1544
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,123
Because he knows no
one can follow him here.

1545
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:57,807
Forget about running,
you can't even walk here.

1546
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,525
This is their personal hell..

1547
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:06,203
..and only they can thrive here.

1548
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,566
Where is he?

1549
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,161
Hello.

1550
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:13,850
Have you brought the master along?

1551
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,201
Yes.

1552
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,681
Send him.

1553
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:18,610
ls my son fine?

1554
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,569
Call Saryu Bhan.

1555
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,047
Go on.

1556
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,486
Saryu Bhan.

1557
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,403
He has my child.

1558
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:56,922
I'll be grateful if you spare his life.

1559
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,731
You've shown me so many facets of death.

1560
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:04,763
I can't comply with it all my life.

1561
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,686
Please show a facet of mercy..

1562
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,288
..and I'll be grateful forever.

1563
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,807
I wish you had shown
this compassion on day 1..

1564
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,849
..then this would've never happened.

1565
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:22,247
Your foolishness has
made the entire area insecure.

1566
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:28,527
Mr. Collector, you
humiliated his father.

1567
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,404
This is coal religion.

1568
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:35,368
They understand only one law.

1569
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,926
Either burn yourself or decimate others.

1570
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:42,007
This is why everyone worships coal here.

1571
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,403
It won't be easy to convince him.

1572
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,250
But I will try.

1573
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:35,483
So.. you got the news.

1574
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,605
Why are you crying?

1575
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:41,051
I am absolutely fine.

1576
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,967
Such high and lows are normal.

1577
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,604
But why did you come here?

1578
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:51,882
Don't you know how
dangerous this place is?

1579
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,403
And you called me here too.

1580
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,447
Karua, leave with the child.

1581
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,645
Can you see the child?

1582
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:08,882
He's on the ground there.
But God knows what they are up to.

1583
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,287
I won't leave my land.

1584
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,922
You have to Karua.

1585
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,680
They've got you in their sights.

1586
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,961
I am there.

1587
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,647
I'll clear them out.

1588
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:25,806
No, master.

1589
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,765
Tell this land to devour me.

1590
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,606
Karua.

1591
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:33,850
What are you saying?

1592
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,364
I beg you.

1593
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:41,366
I know no God, except for you.

1594
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,284
You're my day and night.

1595
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,569
I breathe because of you.

1596
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:56,925
You're the benefactor of my world.

1597
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,885
I never asked you for anything.

1598
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,606
But I will today.

1599
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:10,163
Order Koye
aancha
..

1600
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,121
..to devour us both.

1601
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,401
Karua.

1602
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:17,121
Yes, master.

1603
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,525
Give the orders.

1604
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:23,006
Son, what's going on in your mind?

1605
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,927
If you're blamed for my sins, then"

1606
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,765
..may the merits of
good deeds be conferred on you.

1607
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:37,246
I understood one thing, Master.

1608
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:43,245
In order to keep your world intact.

1609
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,409
...I ruined heaven.

1610
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:53,611
I want to rectify my mistake, master.

1611
02:09:57,480 --> 02:09:59,209
Help me.

1612
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:03,328
Liberate Koyelaanchal.

1613
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,641
Tell Koyelaanchal to devour us.

1614
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:15,525
Say it, Master.

1615
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,368
Order Koye
aancha
..

1616

and separation is strange."
