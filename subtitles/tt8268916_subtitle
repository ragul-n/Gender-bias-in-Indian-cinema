1
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,020
So...

2
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,300
Tell me.

3
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,100
Since when you
got addicted to it?

4
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,020
It's not something you
remember as an occasion.

5
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,220
Look here!

6
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,300
I can only help,
if you co-operate.

7
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,380
Ok!?

8
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,940
I'm not aware of anything.

9
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,660
Ey! If you remember,
say something.

10
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,660
Now that your husband has left.

11
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,980
Please answer to my questions
without any fear.

12
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,780
Only then I could help you.

13
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,540
Does he drink alcohol every day?

14
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,060
He doesn't just drink.

15
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,060
He's so consistent, that
sets alarm to have them.

16
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,300
Oh! Since when he
was addicted to it?

17
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,780
Aaah! As far as I'm aware
since I've known him.

18
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,660
I can spot the day, with
his staggering walk.

19
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,220
Where does your husband work?

20
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,020
He's a decorated Rowdy.

21
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,380
He's popular on news too.

22
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,980
Haven't you seen it?

23
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,980
Not bad.

24
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,740
A good sense of humor,
even in such situations.

25
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,100
Off late, I even take the most
serious instances as a comedy.

26
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,220
I understand!

27
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,860
We have to run a few
tests on your husband.

28
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,260
Only then we'll know,
which stage he's at.

29
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,620
With those results we
can plan his treatment.

30
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,420
Don't worry, we'll cure him
as soon as possible. Ok!?

31
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,700
Ask him to come.

32
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,140
Ummm... Madam!

33
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,180
What is it?

34
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,900
We're here, not for him.

35
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,420
What!?

36
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,860
Thank you.

37
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,780
"It's the same for everyone"

38
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,580
"can't just lie to pacify."

39
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,780
"No one can feel sorry
for me being a girl"

40
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,300
"I'm neither below
or above a man"

41
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,540
"I'm a good soul who will
lend my shoulder as a friend."

42
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,700
"Good girls are a rarity, then
you haven't looked closely"

43
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,020
"no one is beyond the notion
of mother who gives birth"

44
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,020
"you came in alone, will
most definitely leave alone"

45
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,300
"who are you to
interfere 'n' advice?"

46
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,420
"not sure how I came in,
wonder how I will exit"

47
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,740
"people should remember
us, when we're gone"

48
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,900
"you came in alone, will
most definitely leave alone"

49
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,100
"who are you to
interfere 'n' advice?"

50
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,180
"not sure how I came in,
wonder how I will exit"

51
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,060
"people should remember
us, when we're gone."

52
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,740
Hi!

53
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,220
- You're so pretty!
- Thank you.

54
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,100
- So sweet.
- Thank you.

55
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,220
Bye!

56
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,860
Thank you!

57
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,140
Hi, I'm Suganya!

58
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,980
- Hi!
- Hello!

59
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,396
- Buddy, get here soon.
- I'm coming.

60
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,060
Come on, quick - What is it?

61
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,020
Buddy!

62
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,380
A hot chick has moved
in to our building.

63
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,580
Don't be kidding - What?

64
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,100
No one can beat Paru though.

65
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,940
You're hopeless!

66
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,860
BUDDY!

67
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,780
Hey!

68
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,220
Ey! Let me go.

69
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,060
Ey! Don't do it.

70
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,060
- Venky!
- Ey...!

71
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,660
- Buddy, she just grazed me.
- Yes!

72
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,180
Hi.

73
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,220
Hi.

74
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,460
- Hi.
- Hi.

75
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,660
- Hey Baby.
- Hi.

76
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,300
Hi!

77
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,780
Hi.

78
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,220
"You came in alone, will
most definitely leave alone"

79
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,380
"who are you to
interfere 'n' advice?"

80
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,540
"not sure how I came in,
wonder how I will exit"

81
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,180
"people should remember
us, when we're gone."

82
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,220
- She's all wet.
- Thanks a lot.

83
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,660
I love rain - Ah!?

84
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Me too.

85
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,260
These two have bonded well.

86
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,220
- What is your name?
- Rita.

87
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,100
- Rita!? I'm Kajal.
- Hi.

88
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,900
I'm Thamarai - Hello.

89
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Suganya.

90
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,700
Paru - Hi, I'm Rita.

91
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,660
I've been observing.

92
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,060
You've been doing
chores everyday.

93
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,900
Is this your routine or what?

94
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,580
Don't you take some rest at all?

95
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,340
Can't help it.
Chores has become my life.

96
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,940
Look over there, they don't
have any other business.

97
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,540
They're here always
to check out women.

98
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,620
If you keep gawking,
I'll pick your eyes.

99
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,220
Come on buddy, keep moving.

100
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,260
How low can they get.

101
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,756
If they're gawking,
let them be poor thing.

102
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,540
They can't help it though.

103
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,100
Moreover, you wear
these skimpy shorts.

104
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,900
They come over to check you out.

105
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,780
Even if I'm covered from head
till toe, still they'll gawk at me.

106
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,980
No matter what I do,
no one checks me out.

107
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,060
Who said so?

108
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,060
Sexy, lies in ones attitude.

109
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,900
Not how they dress.

110
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
We have a WhatsApp group,
do you want to join?

111
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,660
Ya, why not!

112
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,300
- Brindavan Beauties uh?
- Ya!

113
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,540
Didn't you guys
get a better name?

114
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,820
Hereafter, our group will
be called 'Hot Chicks'.

115
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,100
Ok, come let's take
a selfie together.

116
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,020
Look over here, say HI!

117
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,660
That's it. Bye!

118
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,060
- Hey!
- Hi.

119
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,580
- What happened?
- No idea, it doesn't start.

120
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,820
Let me try.

121
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,700
- There it started.
- Awesome dude.

122
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,740
Yes - Thank you.

123
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,900
So sweet of you to help me out.

124
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,100
Fine, what do you do?

125
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,540
I work in a beauty parlor.

126
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,020
Also I've been studying
Advanced Beautician course.

127
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,780
What about you?
Where is your office?

128
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,676
It's just 10 minutes from here.
Easy Software Systems.

129
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,460
Oh, Engineering is it.

130
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,940
Studious women
are never my forte.

131
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,700
Come on, I've been running
this on a fake certificate.

132
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,140
Ok, I'll see you outside.

133
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,820
- Ok, bye.
- Bye!

134
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,260
- Hi!
- How are you?

135
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,940
"Let's witness the world,
through the eyes of a bird"

136
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,940
"we're that God, who
isn't trapped in a idol"

137
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,740
"we've stepped over hurdles
and have come a long way"

138
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,940
"attained ecstasy
without compromises"

139
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:29,980
"vibrant colors are blooming,
beyond the borders of a saree"

140
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:40,020
"it's time to rest the heart, which
kept screaming all this while"

141
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:57,020
"pave a path for yourself,
don't be dependent"

142
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,460
"the path you choose
will bloom success"

143
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:10,620
"new phase of life blooms, at
every rotation of this earth."

144
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,900
Excuse me!

145
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,580
Your Rangoli was
amazing, have a look.

146
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,540
It's really beautiful.

147
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,980
If you give me your number, I'll
share this picture with you.

148
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,620
I hope you know,
that I'm married.

149
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,220
I really like you a lot.

150
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,460
What's it dear?
You're getting very romantic.

151
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,140
Nothing much though.

152
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,820
New place.

153
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,300
First rain.

154
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,180
And you here with me.

155
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,420
I Love You!

156
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,740
CHEERS!

157
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,580
- One more shot, please.
- I'm high already

158
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,060
I'm done!

159
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm not high at all.

160
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,820
Oh my dear, that's
enough for me.

161
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,220
I can never compete with you.

162
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,420
Then I'll be sloshed.

163
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,660
Then nothing will work for me

164
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,300
it should work though

165
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,420
I'll spare you.

166
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,620
Hey!

167
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,260
Thamarai!

168
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,460
Why are you crying?

169
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,620
What happened?

170
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,540
Crying won't solve your issues.

171
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,060
Tell me what is it?

172
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,300
My husband went back to
working for Pandi, Rita.

173
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,060
Here on, the streak of fights
and murders will continue.

174
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,980
Either they will kill him.

175
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,820
Or he will end up in a prison.

176
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,100
I let my parents
down, entrusting him.

177
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,980
I'll end up being an orphan.

178
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,620
When he's back tonight,
tear him apart.

179
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,020
How can you say such things?

180
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,660
I'm a local Tamizh girl.

181
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,180
There's no harm in speaking up.

182
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,740
I am a Tamizh girl too.

183
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,140
But I can't speak up like that.

184
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,740
Not an issue.

185
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,180
I'll teach you few cuss words.

186
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,980
Churn them exactly to him.

187
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,420
If I do that, he'll
kill me alive.

188
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,020
Ok, then I'll give
you another idea.

189
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,140
Better, you have wild
sex and seduce him.

190
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,460
After which, he'll
be your slave.

191
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,820
Why are you so coy about it?

192
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,060
He's your husband right?

193
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,500
Yes.

194
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,740
But how can I go ahead with it?

195
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,900
Should I teach you that as well?

196
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,860
Once the night falls,
it'll kick in.

197
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,620
It's fine, thanks for your help.
I'll take it from here.

198
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,060
Ok bye, I'm leaving.

199
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,740
Hey wait, I'll go and
get sweets for you.

200
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,860
Sweets!? What's the occasion?

201
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,460
It's my birthday.

202
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,020
What!? Happy Birthday!

203
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,020
- Where's the party?
- Party-uh?

204
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,460
- Yes.
- My husband doesn't even remember.

205
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,140
Let him be, I'll
throw a party for you.

206
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
Tonight we're going to
celebrate your birthday.

207
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,900
Come to the terrace at 8pm.

208
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,900
Ok!?

209
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,316
Buddy, did anything
work out with that girl?

210
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,860
- Tell me buddy.
- Nothing worked out.

211
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,260
We're not that
lucky to have one.

212
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,060
- Hi guys!
- Hi!

213
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,540
Today is Thamarai's birthday,
we're going to party.

214
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,260
Can you guys help us with it?

215
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,180
Sure we will - Definitely!

216
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,300
Ok...!

217
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,500
Buddy, let's impress them today.

218
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,196
- Please hang these on that side.
- Sure, ok.

219
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,140
Will you be able to do it?

220
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,740
Hope you won't mess it up?

221
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,700
We will do it right.

222
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,060
Hang this blue thing over here.

223
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,580
- Sure we will do that.
- Thank you so much, thank you.

224
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,980
Buddy, all girls has come to the party.

225
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,140
We are invite it if this work done

226
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,940
I hope Paru will come
to the party as well.

227
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,140
- Sure she will come too.
- Great, then we'll rock this.

228
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,220
He's too lucky for
the sake of mankind.

229
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,740
We can't help it though, buddy.

230
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,300
SURPRISE...!!!

231
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,860
Hey, what is all this?

232
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,660
Happy Birthday!

233
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,500
Happy Birthday to you.

234
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,180
Happy Birthday to you.

235
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,820
Happy Birthday dear Thamarai.

236
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,100
Happy Birthday to you.

237
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,116
- What is it?
- What is this for?

238
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,700
You can use this in future.

239
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Hey, tell me the truth.

240
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,500
Isn't this Riya's gift?

241
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,180
Are you trying to re-cycle?

242
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,940
Hey, no no... I put a
lot of thought in to it.

243
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,620
Very nice!

244
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,340
Rita, where is your gift?

245
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,900
That's right,
where is your gift?

246
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,420
- Follow me!
- Where to?

247
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,260
- What is it?
- Just follow me.

248
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,140
- What happened?
- No idea.

249
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,700
Wow, that's awesome.

250
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,180
I've arranged for a nice party.

251
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,420
If you see we have chicken

252
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,420
there's soft drinks

253
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,700
three beers and...

254
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,700
- Buddy, Paru must've come.
- Only girls!

255
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,556
- We're going to rock the party.
- Sure, we will rock it.

256
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,060
Fine, open the door.

257
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,100
- It seems locked.
- Come on push it hard.

258
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,700
Ey, I think they've
have locked it.

259
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,140
Don't you get it?

260
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,660
They could've let us in.

261
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,220
They ditched us, buddy.

262
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,340
What do you guys wanna drink?

263
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,340
What soft drink is that?

264
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,820
This is called 'Beer'.

265
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,700
Oh! Beeer-uh!

266
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,940
- Do you take alcohol?
- Yes.

267
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,716
Occasionally, but if it's
a party then definitely.

268
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,340
Oh...!

269
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,100
My husband too, drinks
the same everyday.

270
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,700
But I stick with Miranda.

271
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,340
- Is this enough?
- Mmmm.

272
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,500
Sugi, wait for me.

273
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,020
It's Miranda for you right?

274
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,140
I don't mind the Beeer though.

275
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,420
It's not Beeer,
it is called Beer!

276
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,180
Ok fine, give me
that 'Bear' though...

277
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,500
Hey, shall I try one too?

278
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,460
I never thought you
guys will be drinking too.

279
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,380
In fact, I got some only for me.

280
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Mmmm, ok wait.

281
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,300
Who is she calling?

282
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,980
Venku, get us some alcohol
and quickly come upstairs.

283
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,340
Hey...!

284
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,020
I want one too...

285
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,820
OH...!

286
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,556
Get the entire stash of
alcohol and come upstairs.

287
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,540
Also get Thamarai's pickle too.

288
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,060
- Hi!
- Hi!

289
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,700
Buddy, he's going
to open the door.

290
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,780
Come let's get
inside, come on quick.

291
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,140
- Hope, I'm looking good?
- You look great.

292
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,580
- How about me?
- Everything is good.

293
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,660
Hey, so sweet of you.

294
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,540
So sweet Thank you!

295
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,260
They are closed again.

296
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,020
What are you guys holding on to?

297
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,180
It's beer, bro.

298
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,940
Aren't you joining the party?

299
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,780
India-Pakistan match is quite
interesting, aren't you watching?

300
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,420
Fine, go and watch that match.
Bye.

301
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,500
His hunger pangs are satisfied
at regular intervals.

302
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,340
It's us, who are always
left high and dry.

303
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm so freaking jealous.

304
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,140
Paru, must've dressed well.

305
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,940
Too bad, I'm missing that.

306
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Fine, come on let us at
least catch the match.

307
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,140
CHEERS...!!!

308
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,380
Beer and Thamarai's Pickle

309
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,300
is an awesome combination.

310
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,420
Be careful, don't
swallow your hand.

311
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,020
I don't feel anything though.

312
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Give it to me.

313
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,940
- I'll give it a try.
- Oh!

314
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
Oh no!

315
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,540
My husband is calling.

316
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,260
My rant will begin,
'cause I'm high.

317
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,780
You haven't even started yet...

318
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,300
you're too much dear.

319
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,740
- Hello!
- What happened?

320
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,140
Why is your voice quivering?

321
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,500
- Nothing much, this beer...
- Beer-uh?

322
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,700
Hey, hey, hey... don't
say anything.

323
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,620
No, no... I meant to say
can't open the bureau.

324
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,300
Oh that, just give a couple
of nudges, it'll open.

325
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,140
Oh, I should nudge is it?

326
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,340
Is that so?

327
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,700
You were right, it's open now.

328
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,060
Fine, listen...

329
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,580
I have a gig, so
will be late tonight.

330
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,940
You go to sleep - Fine, ok.

331
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,180
Please take care dear.

332
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,020
I can handle myself.
I'm hanging up.

333
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,540
Hey, what happened?

334
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,580
Tell me what happened?

335
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,220
Sounds like he's
going to kill someone.

336
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,140
You did get married to him, in
spite of the fact that he's a rowdy.

337
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,580
You look so innocent, how
did you end up with a thug?

338
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,500
"My heart is tingling, and
confused at the same time."

339
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,100
"Not sure what's
happening, with me oh dear"

340
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,180
"legs are dancing automatically."

341
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,220
"Without my knowledge, it dances well."

342
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,220
"In my life which was an empty ground"

343
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,380
"desires are taking a
toll and bouncing a sixer"

344
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,980
"holding back will
be a foolishness."

345
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,300
"It's driving me crazy."

346
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,820
"My eyes are drawn to
you like a fish hook."

347
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,340
"Senses are straight,
will scheme sharper."

348
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,500
"We've heard and
have seen a lot."

349
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,700
"Let's get to a conclusion!"

350
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,020
"All I need is love,
nothing else matters."

351
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,340
"If I don't get it, that
will drive me insane."

352
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,620
"Sleepless nights have begun"

353
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,860
"caste doesn't make
sense, all I need is love."

354
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,180
"All I need is love,
nothing else matters."

355
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,340
"If I don't get it, that
will drive me insane."

356
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,780
"Sleepless nights have begun"

357
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,340
"caste doesn't make
sense, all I need is love."

358
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,900
What are you looking at?

359
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,780
Does it look like we're
playing, get lost.

360
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,740
Can't you hear me?
Aren't you scared?

361
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,980
Fear!? And that too me?

362
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,220
I really like you a lot.

363
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,980
I just want to keep
looking at you.

364
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,820
Enough as it is,
get lost from here.

365
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,100
One whack and you'll be done.

366
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,140
You do seem very short tempered.

367
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,260
But you're good soul.

368
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,180
Seems like you watch
a lot of cinema.

369
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,820
Churning out strong dialogues.

370
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,500
You seem too young,
better get home safe.

371
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,340
Were you talking about me?

372
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,060
I'm not too young though

373
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm 18 years old now.

374
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,380
Oh, is it?

375
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,420
Then it's fine.

376
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,260
Shall we get married?

377
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,620
You can be beside me all
your life looking at me.

378
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,500
I've worked hard for my exams.

379
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,140
Once they're over,
we'll get married.

380
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,900
I was kidding,
continue with your studies.

381
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,380
I have to get married to you.

382
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,500
Just 2 months left for
the exams to get over.

383
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,100
Until then, bear with me.

384
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,100
"Whatever this is..."

385
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,660
"Whatever this is..."

386
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,100
"What is this?
What is this dear?"

387
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,140
"My heart is tingling, and
confused at the same time."

388
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,420
"Not sure what's
happening, with me oh dear."

389
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,780
"Thump it!"

390
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,940
"Is this truly love?"

391
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,540
"Thump it!"

392
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,500
"Is it truly...?"

393
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,540
"Have I gone crazy!"

394
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,980
You and your job, my foot!

395
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,340
What happened?
You have you come so early.

396
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,500
Dear.

397
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,060
Are you drunk?

398
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,380
Tell me - Nothing.

399
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,220
- Listen...
- Get lost.

400
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,580
Stop the car.

401
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,140
Why are you driving like this?
You are almost hitting the bus.

402
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,820
What seems to be your problem?

403
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,220
Ah, can't you see I'm driving?

404
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,780
- Don't shout.
- I'll punch you hard.

405
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,980
I'll break your teeth.

406
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,860
How dare you raise your hand?

407
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,900
He won't continue the job
for at least one month.

408
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,580
He'll create fuss if he go to the job.

409
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,380
He resigned his job and
started to drink 24 hours daily.

410
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,060
That's enough.

411
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,060
Thamarai, get inside.

412
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,060
That's enough your drink.

413
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,540
Thamarai, please go away.

414
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,860
Hey, get inside
Leave that bottle here.

415
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,820
Off late he's not
affectionate to me.

416
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,380
Just 'cause he's
feeling up to it-

417
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,780
- don't I have my
own feelings too?

418
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,460
Damn with you guys.

419
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
All my high is
down the drain now.

420
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,980
If someone has an erotic
tale to narrate, please do.

421
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,860
If you guys don't,
then just shut up.

422
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,380
- Paru!
- Mmmm.

423
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,100
It's not even a year
since you're married.

424
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,716
Come on spit out
everything, come on dear.

425
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,220
- Tell us, Paru.
- Come on, say it.

426
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,180
Don't you talk much, do you?

427
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,180
You were all ears, when
I was telling my tale.

428
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,060
You better tell your story now.

429
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,380
May be I can tell you guys
about my wedding night.

430
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,020
Oh yeah, please go ahead.

431
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,380
Now she's hitting the target.

432
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,860
Keep going.

433
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,180
I went into my room
with a glass of milk.

434
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,860
I placed the milk on the table

435
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,220
then went ahead
and sat on the bed.

436
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,060
I looked at him...

437
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,260
he turned shy and started
looking at the floor.

438
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,820
Then...?

439
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,260
After that he never moved

440
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,540
I kept looking everywhere though.

441
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,900
Then again, I slowly
turned towards him

442
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,500
he was still staring
at the floor.

443
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,660
I understood though...

444
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,940
that he's quite
inexperienced in these matters

445
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,420
I was inexperienced too.

446
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,420
Still I was ready for it.

447
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,780
Fine, now get to the point.

448
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,420
He suddenly turned towards me

449
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,220
and I smiled.

450
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,340
That's it!

451
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,940
Blink of an eye, he
was right next to me.

452
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,100
OH...!!!

453
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,100
I tried to move away a bit...

454
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,380
but he held my hand.

455
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,140
Then, blink of an eye he
must've been on top of you?

456
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,860
That's awesome,
how did you know?

457
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
I'm aware of everything.

458
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,340
What are you looking for?

459
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Ssshh! I'm turning
the lights off.

460
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,980
OH...!!!

461
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,020
BED

462
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,940
I

463
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,060
And HIM.

464
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,380
While we were headed to climax...

465
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,140
Why did you stop?

466
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,260
What is the noise?

467
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,660
Paru, what happened?

468
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,820
It was extremely embarrassing.

469
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,860
The worse part
about that bed was

470
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,180
it's been in the
family for generations.

471
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,740
- Mmmm!
- Yes.

472
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,420
All the relatives, made fun
of us stating it throughout.

473
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,660
I thought you were a mute on these
things, but you've rocked it.

474
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,500
Were you singing during
your wedding night?

475
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,860
Didn't you do anything at all
during your wedding night?

476
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,340
- Just wait!
- What is it?

477
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,300
I have to recall.

478
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,900
I was very tired on that day.

479
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,620
I went straight to sleep.

480
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,140
So how is it going now?

481
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,460
Since Ria was born,
I've lost interest.

482
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,860
My bungalow is now haunted.

483
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,460
When are you planning
to revive your bungalow?

484
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,740
Let that go, but you have
a shiny bungalow though.

485
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,260
How long it's been,
since you were married?

486
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,860
Marriage, not me.

487
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
Then...?

488
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,940
Is it what they
say 'Get together'?

489
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,980
That's called 'Live-in together',
this is 'get together'.

490
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,340
Why didn't you get married?

491
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,300
I'm not cut out for the
concept of marriage.

492
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,180
I'm happy with my bungalow.

493
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,860
Just entry and exit.

494
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,420
My choice.

495
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,820
In simple terms.

496
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,340
My Life! My Rules!

497
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,740
You're like a free bird.
Isn't there anyone who questions you?

498
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,260
Who will ask though?

499
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,100
I've never seen the
face of my parents.

500
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,940
I grew up at a shelter.

501
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,860
Later, one guy adopted me.

502
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,460
But then he tried to molest me.

503
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,140
I've been through everything.

504
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,460
You guys believed it?

505
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,340
Is this back story necessary
to justify my behaviour?

506
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,820
I like doing these
things, so I do it.

507
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,380
That was a good one.

508
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,220
Damn it, I haven't
started to drink yet

509
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,140
and we're out of alcohol.

510
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,220
What do we do now?

511
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,020
Ey... show me your license?

512
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,100
Hey Police, we're drunk!

513
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,980
- Catch us if you can.
- We're drunk!

514
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,580
It's closed, shucks.

515
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,420
- HEY!
- Ask them to open it.

516
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,260
Open the door - Ey, open it.

517
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,740
You never shut it down,
when you were asked to.

518
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,300
Why is it closed now?

519
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,540
Hey, open the shutter, you idiot.

520
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,460
Can't you hear us, open it.

521
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,180
- Open it.
- He's not opening though.

522
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,100
Move, I know the password.

523
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,820
Move!

524
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,020
"Open Sesame"

525
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,620
I want a beer - Kumaru!

526
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,540
I too want one.

527
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,420
Kumaru!

528
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,716
- You too want it right?
- Yes I do.

529
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,780
It's raining!

530
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,060
Open...!

531
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,300
Yayyy! Kumaru!

532
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,700
Awesome dude!

533
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,460
Sister Rita, what do you want?

534
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,860
Three Beers!

535
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,420
"It's a Girls Night-Out."

536
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,180
"Boys aren't allowed"

537
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,180
"I had a plan to
party all night."

538
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,420
"I'm stuck, 'cause I
failed to stock up, you idiot."

539
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:01,900
"Gonna shell out extra dough
to get booze in black market."

540
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,780
"We don't need Soda to mix."

541
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,700
"Water packets are our heroes."

542
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,340
"Get your hands on use and
throw and CHEERS to it."

543
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,700
"Nudge and open the bottle,
that's the beauty of it."

544
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,300
"If not you'll be in
duress spinning the cork."

545
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,740
"Get out of our way."

546
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,460
"Step away from us."

547
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,460
"Give way and let us breathe."

548
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,380
"We're on a trip to nirvana."

549
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,180
"Get out of our way."

550
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,460
"Step away from us."

551
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,900
"Give way and let us breathe."

552
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,380
"Beer-Biriyani,
wanna taste of it?"

553
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,780
"Dance all night and
have fun 'oh dear."

554
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,500
"Beer-Biriyani,
wanna taste of it?"

555
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,940
"Dance all night and
have fun 'oh dear."

556
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,740
"You have no right to advice us."

557
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,420
"Mind your own business."

558
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,900
"Women are gutsy
than men will be."

559
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,140
"Beer-Biriyani,
wanna taste of it?"

560
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,140
"Dance all night and
have fun 'oh dear."

561
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,660
"Beer-Biriyani,
wanna taste of it?"

562
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,420
"Dance all night and
have fun 'oh dear"

563
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,740
"shoplifting at a
petty shop is the best."

564
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,300
"ECR road is totally
empty during the night."

565
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,580
"You bought a beach house,
for weekend getaways."

566
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,340
"But your watchman seems
to love his sleep more."

567
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,900
"When we're thirsty we
run to 'More Thatha'"

568
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,300
"when we're hungry,
Sundari Akka feeds us with love."

569
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,820
"We'll have tea
under the bridge"

570
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,540
"also will smoke
if we're stressed."

571
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,820
"If questioned, we'll
whack that person."

572
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,900
"We'll check out the guys."

573
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,660
"Also will bunk the college."

574
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,780
"Booze and starters will
be our mixed affair."

575
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,740
"You have no right to advice us."

576
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,460
"Mind your own business."

577
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,980
"Women are gutsy
than men will be."

578
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,700
"Beer-Biriyani,
wanna taste of it?"

579
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,140
"Dance all night and
have fun 'oh dear."

580
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,940
"Beer-Biriyani,
wanna taste of it?"

581
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,340
"Dance all night and
have fun 'oh dear."

582
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,956
- Kattan will be for sure right?
- He will be here.

583
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,740
We shouldn't miss
the target this time

584
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,260
we will have to
kill him tonight.

585
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,580
- Check where is he now?
- Sure I will check.

586
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,700
Hello...!

587
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,540
Why are you calling so late?

588
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,260
Now, you've forgotten
my birthday too.

589
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,940
Do you remember once you said...

590
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,900
asking me to leave.

591
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,020
That's why...

592
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,380
I ventured on to a long journey.

593
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,140
You can be at peace now.

594
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,420
Have you gone nuts?

595
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,620
What have you been
up to, without sleeping?

596
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,900
What is he saying?

597
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,380
He's asking me, why
am I not asleep?

598
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,580
Where are you?

599
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,340
Does it really matter?

600
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,740
Ey... Ey... Ey... why
are you laughing?

601
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,940
Who are you with?

602
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,060
Give that to me.

603
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,820
I'll give you a clue

604
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,420
if you're successful
in finding us

605
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,780
I'll reward you 100 points.

606
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,780
Give the phone to Thamarai.

607
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,220
He's swearing at me.

608
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,140
We're at a Biriyani
shop at the moment.

609
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,460
Next to it, is a place where
you can enjoy serene breeze.

610
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,420
If you cut that word short, it will
turn into a cuss word in English.

611
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,740
What cuss word is that?

612
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,660
We all are here at the moment.

613
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,860
All the best!

614
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,500
Ey, if at all I get there...

615
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,100
Hey, what is that?

616
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,700
Have some food please.

617
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,500
- Can you please feed me?
- Mmmm.

618
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,820
I don't want - It's delicious

619
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,780
- I'm not hungry.
- Have some dear.

620
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,900
The Biriyani is amazing.

621
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,900
Do you want some?

622
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,780
How come you have a leg
piece in your Biriyani.

623
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,180
Babyyyy...!

624
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,860
Why aren't you sleeping?

625
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,780
Look at her.

626
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,420
I love you soooo much.

627
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,020
Did she say I love you?

628
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,540
Did she just kiss now?

629
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,380
Bye...!

630
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,620
Are you in a relationship?

631
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,180
You never mentioned it?

632
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,580
All this while you
kept it hidden from us.

633
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,500
It's not mandatory though.

634
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,660
- What do you mean by that?
- Come on...!

635
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,220
Either ways nothing
is going to happen.

636
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,380
Why!?

637
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,500
Our families won't agree to it.

638
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,060
Is caste the issue?

639
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,660
Christian!

640
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,260
We'll have to just reminiscence

641
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,780
and continue living our lives.

642
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,500
Ey...- why don't you tell us
about your relationship to us.

643
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,620
Come on, say it.

644
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,340
Say it!

645
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,100
Shall I recite a poetry?

646
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,220
Yeah, please go ahead.

647
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,140
"Heart which knew only to beat,
thought of you taught it long too."

648
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,220
Heyyyy!

649
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,820
Wow, that was awesome dear.

650
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
You nailed it.

651
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,780
We're all touched.

652
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,900
You can leave.

653
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,060
Damn he found us.

654
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,780
Ey, Thamarai come on leave.

655
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,340
Come along.

656
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,260
Ey!

657
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,020
Are you drunk?

658
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,900
Did you find out that I did?

659
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,100
I did, but just a little.
Shall I prove it?

660
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,260
Ey...!

661
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,940
How dare you guys
got my wife drunk?

662
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,340
Come on!

663
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,940
Wait, I'll come only
if they come along.

664
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,420
Look at her go.

665
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,020
Won't you look at me?

666
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,700
Don't piss me off.

667
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,460
Did you get worried about me?

668
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,580
Get lost!

669
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,060
Come on dear.

670
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,180
She's doing so cute.

671
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,220
Ey... can't you sit
still for a moment.

672
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,460
I'm not doing anything dear...

673
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,100
It's this car which
is rocking us both.

674
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,300
Just sit down.

675
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,940
Come on keep trying,
excite him a bit more.

676
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,260
Keep at it dear.

677
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,180
I have something
prepped for the night.

678
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,260
I'm sure they'll
make a baby tonight.

679
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,900
Ey... shut up, shut up.

680
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,140
Sir, these women are atrocious.

681
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,140
Hey, you better
focus on driving.

682
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,260
Sorry Sir!

683
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,380
Did you see that?
My husband is so gutsy.

684
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Damn she's on fire.

685
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,700
- Hey...!
- Hey.

686
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,540
Could you guys shut up?

687
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,500
Ey... don't be scared.

688
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,660
My husband is a very good guy.

689
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,340
He'll only shoot, if
he's hired for it.

690
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,980
You're going overboard.

691
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,820
Arrogance is it?
I'm going to kill you.

692
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,740
That's a loaded gun.

693
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,940
Ey, give it back.

694
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,180
- Give it to me.
- Ey, let me handle it.

695
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,500
Give that to me.

696
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,980
Do you know, who I am?

697
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,180
RITA

698
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,340
REVOLVER RITA

699
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,340
The gun is fully
loaded, give it back.

700
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,060
Poor thing, give it back to him.

701
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,060
Fine, you can keep
the gun to yourself.

702
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,540
DARLING!

703
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,860
Don't get angry.

704
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,180
You can keep your
tool to yourself.

705
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,780
Boss, I ran into
few issues at home.

706
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,140
I'll be done with the job soon.

707
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,740
I'm sure, I won't
miss it the next time.

708
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,860
Why did you get back
to working for Pandi?

709
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,100
Are you really in love with me?

710
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,580
I'm asking you, isn't it?

711
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,180
Speak up!

712
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,940
How could you expect me to,
when you're in this state.

713
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,980
Go and sleep.

714
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,660
I won't sleep, until
you give me an answer.

715
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,180
Don't be annoying.

716
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,420
Drunkard!

717
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,700
I'm in love ONLY with you,
is that enough?

718
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,980
If that's case, for my sake
can you say that with love.

719
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,980
Do you know, Suganya
recited a beautiful poetry.

720
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,140
Really a poetry?

721
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,980
I'm so outraged now.

722
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,620
Do you want a feel of it?

723
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,940
You look so handsome,
even when you're angry.

724
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,420
Hopeless!

725
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,860
It's been ages, since you've
been affectionate towards me.

726
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,900
Thamarai!

727
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,540
Happy Birthday!

728
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,300
Baby!

729
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,420
Baby!

730
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,060
Hello!

731
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,820
Hi Baby!

732
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,700
I miss you so much.

733
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,220
Can't we be together?

734
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,340
I wanna see you.

735
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,420
I love you so much dear.

736
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,300
So you guys created a ruckus.

737
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,100
That's was the best
birthday of my life.

738
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,140
I laughed a lot, in long time.

739
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,620
Rita really touched our hearts.

740
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,980
It's 'cause of her,
we were all so happy.

741
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,340
She's such a fun character.

742
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,580
Interesting.

743
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,500
Then, what happened?

744
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,860
After that incident, my husband
forbid me to speak to them.

745
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,300
So I stopped talking to them.

746
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,860
Why did you Thamarai?

747
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,900
Just 'cause your husband said
so, you'll lose your friends?

748
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,740
Aren't friends important too?

749
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,020
Look here...

750
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,260
just like how your husband
is important in your life

751
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,300
friends are equally
important too.

752
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,900
Only then life will be interesting.

753
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,180
You're correct madam.

754
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,380
That's why 3 months later...

755
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,620
I resumed talking to them.

756
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,660
Uh!?

757
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,380
Oh! Ok!

758
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,660
Hi, come in.

759
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,300
Come inside, how are you?

760
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,540
- I'm good.
- Sit down.

761
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,900
What's up dude, how come
you got reminded of me?

762
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,740
What happened?

763
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,220
Shall we party tonight?

764
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,860
Beer or Wine?

765
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,540
Shall I go to Rita's house?

766
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,340
Come on you don't have
to ask, please go ahead.

767
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,420
Fine, I've kept
food on the table.

768
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,940
- I'll have it.
- Mmmm.

769
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,980
Hey Thamarai!

770
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,380
Hi Thamarai!

771
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,140
Hi...!

772
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,020
We all missed you
a lot Thamarai.

773
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,540
We weren't expecting
you, so started drinking.

774
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,580
We're just 2 bottles down.

775
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,940
Not an issue.

776
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,740
Ey... did Ria doze off?

777
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,580
Ya, just now.

778
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,820
Sugi, how are you?

779
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,140
I'm fine.

780
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,740
I don't think so, she looks dull.

781
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,540
Just 'cause your hubby
asked not to talk to us...

782
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,876
how can you stay
without talking to us?

783
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,660
- Ya!
- Huh!?

784
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,900
It's not that...

785
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,740
we went quite
overboard the other day.

786
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,940
OH...!!!

787
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,060
She always has her hubby's back.

788
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,500
How can she though?

789
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,620
Am I right, Thamarai?

790
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,660
What? What's been cooking?

791
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,500
Your face is gleaming with glow.

792
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,500
Look like the ride is
quite smooth these days.

793
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,020
He's a rowdy right...

794
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,460
he works out, builds muscle.

795
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,140
Hey, what are you trying to say?

796
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,180
Ey...!

797
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,820
I thought you'll know,
'cause you broke a bed.

798
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,980
Oh!

799
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,020
Oh... oh!

800
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,020
Oh... OH...!!!

801
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,620
Sugi, why are you so quiet?

802
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,580
Nothing, I just got back
from work so little tired.

803
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,980
- Cheer up!
- Ya.

804
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,420
Why aren't you
drinking your wine?

805
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,100
I don't want to, if not
I'll be on the entire night.

806
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,140
Ey... you can have two pegs here

807
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,900
later you can
continue at your place.

808
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,540
CHEERS!

809
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,180
Round 2 IMPORTED LIQUOR.

810
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,540
What is this? It tastes
like cough syrup.

811
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,020
This is a 4 year old wine.

812
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,820
Oh no, is this so old?

813
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,420
Hope it's not gone bad.

814
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,700
Idiot!

815
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,180
Wine gets tastier as it ages.

816
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,500
Oh, is that so.

817
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,900
Does that mean,
am I tastier too?

818
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,460
Exactly, yes!

819
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,460
A half-boil will be great.

820
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,660
- Baby.
- Ya, baby.

821
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,340
Can you please
make an half-boil?

822
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,620
- Of course, anything for you love.
- Thank you.

823
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,500
Hey, how did you manage
to score this gold mine?

824
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,196
He seems to be a very good man.

825
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,620
Why don't you better
get married to him.

826
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,900
- Ya...
- Exactly!

827
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,036
Now that you guys have said

828
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,580
he'll start ranting
about marriage.

829
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,620
Hey, he's really sweet.

830
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,900
Thanks!

831
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,500
You heard that right?

832
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,420
I did

833
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,900
I'll find you a good match sooner.

834
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,780
You're going to pay
for this tonight.

835
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,820
Hey, baby...!

836
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,060
I'll take care of her.

837
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,756
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Sure.

838
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,660
Ok.

839
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,300
Come on let's go.

840
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,900
They're made for each other.

841
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,340
Yes.

842
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,540
Hey Sugi, why are you crying?

843
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,700
What happened?

844
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,540
Just like them, Chris and
I were totally in love.

845
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,780
Chris is getting married
tomorrow at Pondicherry.

846
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,340
Hey, Chris's parents didn't agree?

847
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,420
No!

848
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,100
Sugi, crying won't
fetch you anything.

849
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,836
Why don't you speak to
your parents about it?

850
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,820
Ya!

851
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,820
I'm sure they won't agree to it.

852
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,220
Doesn't matter if
they agree or not

853
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,980
you don't give up on your love.

854
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,060
It's really hard
for me to do that.

855
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,100
There's only one option left.

856
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,220
I should find a way
to forget Chris.

857
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,100
If I drink a lot, I will
definitely forget Chris.

858
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,140
Ey, Sugi it's nonsense.

859
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,940
Hey, Sugi - Sugi!

860
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,580
- What are you doing?
- Rita!

861
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,980
Stop it, enough with the drinks.

862
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,116
Which genius stated alcohol
will make you forget?

863
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,300
There's nothing such,
you can't forget.

864
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,180
Be brave and bring him back

865
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,460
I'll handle it.

866
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,700
I don't have that courage.

867
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,380
I'm not courageous
like you, Rita.

868
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,180
Oh God!

869
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,780
It's all over now.

870
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,340
I have to drink a lot

871
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,820
and should forget Chris too.

872
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:55,900
Ey, Sugi!

873
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,980
Hey, Sugi!

874
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,220
Hey, stop it already.

875
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,340
That's enough.

876
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,700
Oh no!

877
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,020
Sugi, why do you have to
give up on your relationship?

878
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,140
Love is an eternal feeling.

879
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,140
True love just happens once.

880
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,860
You please don't give up on it.

881
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,660
- You're right.
- Yes.

882
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,260
Why should I give up?

883
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,780
I want my Chris back.

884
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,260
But I don't know what to do.

885
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,740
In my opinion...

886
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,860
you should better
let go off Chris.

887
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,860
- Shut up!
- Hey...!

888
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,460
Ya, obviously
that's your opinion.

889
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,620
You got lucky with your love.

890
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,380
So you'll lecture everyone.

891
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,860
It's not that.

892
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,340
I was stating my experience.

893
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,820
Better get married to a guy
who your parents choose.

894
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,340
Love is a mirage

895
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,900
it will disappear
as you get closer.

896
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,100
Then it's you who
will be in pain.

897
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,900
Please don't cry.

898
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,340
Don't cry, Sugi.

899
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,260
I have to drink a lot.

900
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,636
- Also will have to forget Chris.
- Stop it.

901
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,620
Hey Sugi, stop it.

902
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,340
Sugi please listen to
us, just stop this.

903
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,420
Wait, I'll speak to them.

904
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,460
It won't happen,
and it's impossible.

905
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,380
No one can make it happen.

906
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,220
I have no other choice
but to let go off Chris.

907
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,500
Ey... Ey, Sugi!

908
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,460
That's enough - Hey!

909
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,540
Hey, what's this nonsense Sugi.

910
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,740
- I said enough.
- You guys finished it.

911
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,700
- Hey... Ey... what?
- Be careful.

912
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,300
- What's wrong with her?
- Sugi!

913
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,620
Hey, I said it's enough.

914
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,900
Stop drinking, it's enough.

915
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,220
- Please listen to us.
- What's wrong with her?

916
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,116
- She's not listening.
- Keep a tab on my drinks.

917
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,380
Have you gone crazy,
what are you saying?

918
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,540
I have to drink,
please let me...

919
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,340
What's your problem now?

920
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,700
I have to forget Chris.

921
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,220
Enough of it Sugi, listen to us.

922
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,020
Sugi, I did say
will take you there.

923
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,820
We're going there,
what else do you need?

924
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,860
- Enough Sugi.
- We'll go there and nab him.

925
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,740
Sugi, we're here to help.

926
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,020
You guys can't help me.

927
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,716
- No one can help me with it.
- Who said so?

928
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,460
We will make sure
to get you your guy.

929
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,540
We're going there and will nab him.
That's it.

930
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,820
Don't worry, come.

931
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,620
I have to forget about Chris.

932
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,020
Come on, I did
promise you right.

933
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,180
Stop crying now.

934
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,700
Sugi, Sugi please don't cry.

935
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,236
It's ok, don't worry
nothing will go wrong.

936
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,796
- We're here for you.
- We'll go and talk to them.

937
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,940
There's will be no problem.

938
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,580
Hey Sugi, where are you going?

939
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,580
Hey Sugi!

940
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,100
Only this will help
me forget Chris.

941
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,100
Ey... take that
knife away from her.

942
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,700
- Rita!
- You've gone crazy.

943
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,500
Please don't cry Sugi!

944
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,300
It's ok, why are you crying now?

945
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,060
We'll go there.

946
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,620
It's going to be fine.

947
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,980
I thought it's been long and
she wanted to have drinks

948
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,860
she rocked the dejesus out of me.

949
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,700
My head is spinning now.

950
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,780
Oh no, I'm very scared.

951
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,380
I'm still shivering.

952
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,300
If we ask her not to forget
Chris, she wants to forget

953
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,260
but when we ask her to
forget, she denies it.

954
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,460
I don't understand this.

955
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,100
I was really scared.

956
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,580
What if she had slit her wrist?

957
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,740
Ah... what would have we done?

958
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,740
We'll make sure to get
Sugi and Chris together.

959
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,820
Ok!?

960
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,660
"Girlfriends, we're
the mighty Girlfriends."

961
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,620
"A friend in need, friend
indeed... girlfriends we're."

962
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,460
"Girlfriends, we're
the mighty Girlfriends."

963
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,340
"Friendship made our
lives trendy dear."

964
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,260
"Never share anything
with our parents"

965
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,980
"but we don't hide
anything from our friends."

966
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,740
"We lend our ears to
their sob stories."

967
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,740
"But will make sure to
make fun of it later"

968
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,500
"we always share our
drinks with each other"

969
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,460
"we don't mind introducing
them to new guys."

970
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:48,060
"No matter what it is,
girlfriends have my back."

971
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,820
"Girlfriends, we're
the mighty Girlfriends."

972
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,740
"A friend in need, friend
indeed... girlfriends we're."

973
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,740
"Girlfriends, we're
the mighty Girlfriends."

974
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,100
"Friendship made our
lives trendy dear."

975
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,620
"If you're blessed
with a friend"

976
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,860
"she can sense your
issues at the brink of it."

977
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,180
"She'll stand by you
during tough times"

978
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,300
"also she'll be the
shoulder to lean on."

979
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,100
"If true friendship
is your companion"

980
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,020
"even the sorrows will
not dare to come closer"

981
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,340
"your worries will vanish."

982
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,380
"If true friendship
is your companion"

983
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,260
"even the sorrows will
not dare to come closer"

984
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,220
"your worries will vanish."

985
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,460
"Friendship will
change your lives"

986
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,180
"you can't avoid the
brim at the shores"

987
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:30,540
"we can't live without
the notion of friendship."

988
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:35,700
"Only a women can
understand another woman"

989
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,660
"I too have someone who
can stand up for me"

990
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,860
"we're going to fight for it."

991
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,660
"Girlfriends, we're
the mighty Girlfriends."

992
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,500
"A friend in need, friend
indeed... girlfriends we're."

993
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,380
"Girlfriends, we're
the mighty Girlfriends."

994
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,220
"Friendship made our
lives trendy dear."

995
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,020
"Never share anything
with our parents"

996
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,900
"but we don't hide
anything from our friends."

997
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,740
"We lend our ears to
their sob stories."

998
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,900
"But will make sure to
make fun of it later."

999
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,820
"Love might lose its ground."

1000
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,540
"But friendship
remains victorious."

1001
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,140
"We'll celebrate friendship"

1002
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,300
"no matter who our friend
is we'll celebrate them"

1003
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,340
"separated by color,
caste and religion"

1004
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,540
"we'll bond through friendship."

1005
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,820
Move!

1006
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,500
Move!

1007
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,820
Stand back.

1008
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,700
Get out, get out.

1009
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,580
Stand back.

1010
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,780
Stand back!

1011
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,380
Let them go, let them go.

1012
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,260
Go!

1013
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,620
Who is she? And why
is she holding them?

1014
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,500
Don't let her getaway.

1015
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,500
Ey... move!

1016
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,380
Ey, get inside the car.

1017
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,660
Start the car. Go, go, go.

1018
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,580
Ey, just shut up.

1019
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,140
Go, go... faster!

1020
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,620
Ey, just shut up.

1021
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,260
Quiet, ok!?

1022
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,940
Ey, drive faster. Faster!

1023
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,260
Keep at it - Huh!?

1024
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,700
Hey, someone is following us.

1025
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:14,940
Oh my God!

1026
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,740
Keep going idiot - Oh no!

1027
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,220
Oh no, keep moving.

1028
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,380
Come drive faster.

1029
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,260
Faster - I'm driving faster.

1030
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,820
Keep driving straight,
and take that service lane.

1031
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,980
Fast.

1032
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,620
Oh my God, they're
getting closer.

1033
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,900
Go faster - I'm going faster.

1034
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,220
Kajal, drive faster.

1035
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,100
Ok drive zig-zag.

1036
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,140
Ya!

1037
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,196
Go faster - They're behind us.

1038
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,980
They're getting closer,
come drive faster.

1039
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,100
Go behind them.

1040
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,140
Ey...!

1041
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,420
Stop.

1042
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,780
Go, go, go faster!

1043
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,980
Oh my God, they're getting closer.

1044
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,220
Hey success!

1045
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,860
Hey...!

1046
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,940
- Hey!
- Awww.

1047
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,740
Sugi, look over there.

1048
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,900
Hey!

1049
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,180
- Look we got him.
- He's quite handsome.

1050
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,380
Thanks!

1051
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,220
Thank you!

1052
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,420
Dude, they are beautiful.

1053
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,660
You guys have been relieved
right, get out from here.

1054
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,196
Sir, we'll just stay for 10
minutes and then will leave.

1055
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,340
Don't you understand?

1056
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,260
Hey, what's with 10 minutes, get lost.

1057
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,740
Always here to annoy
us to the core.

1058
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,540
Just get out from here.

1059
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,060
Oh my God!

1060
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:57,900
What happened?

1061
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,580
I'm not able to even imagine it.

1062
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,300
Both together, shucks.

1063
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,100
Tea.

1064
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,380
Take this - Ah!

1065
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:06,860
No, I don't.

1066
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,020
Don't want?

1067
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,500
- Rita!
- Mmmm.

1068
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:14,180
What would 2 girls actually do?

1069
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,060
You must have experience,
please tell me.

1070
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,660
I don't have such
experience though.

1071
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,260
Kajal is the most
experienced person here.

1072
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,300
Ask her instead.

1073
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,060
Their way is quite simple though.

1074
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,340
Exactly how?

1075
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,100
That's...

1076
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,900
That's not even an issue, buddy.

1077
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,020
What is she even saying?

1078
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,580
Oh!

1079
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,220
What? Be silence.

1080
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,980
Look here, you can't
be giggling out here.

1081
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,940
Let's go, inspector
is calling you guys.

1082
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,380
I'm sorry!

1083
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,660
- My whole body is aching.
- Ya right!

1084
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,500
They're not available at the
place in Bangalore you guys said.

1085
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,260
Where did you guys send them?

1086
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,860
It's better you
guys tell us now.

1087
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,060
There's no way you guys
aren't aware where they're.

1088
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,620
We swear, have no
idea where they are.

1089
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,700
We just helped our
friend to get her love.

1090
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,140
There's no harm in it.

1091
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,900
Even we were under the impression
that she's in love with a guy.

1092
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,236
But in the end we
were surprised too.

1093
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,580
My daughter was a fine woman

1094
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,500
it was their daughter
who confused mine.

1095
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,060
Please don't blame my daughter.

1096
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,900
Obviously I'll blame her.
You didn't raise her well.

1097
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,700
If you raise her like a boy,
this is bound to happen.

1098
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:39,100
I let her inside my house
thinking of her as my own.

1099
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,700
You don't teach me how
to raise my daughter.

1100
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,060
Your daughter too has
eloped with my daughter.

1101
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,140
Aunty!

1102
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,140
Didn't you find any
symptoms before they eloped?

1103
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,596
- Symptoms uh?
- It's not a disease.

1104
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,780
Nothing of that sort
was obvious to us.

1105
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,940
Even they used to hug each other

1106
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,820
I thought it was just friendship.

1107
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,500
Madam, enough with
those questions.

1108
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,660
Ranting nonsense.

1109
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:01,820
Can't you stay put?

1110
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,300
Sir, I'll revert my case

1111
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,140
either ways they have eloped.

1112
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,940
Family's dignity
has been tarnished.

1113
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,060
You don't have to
look for them anymore.

1114
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,420
I'll manage with some
excuse with my relatives.

1115
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,740
You just shut up.

1116
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,020
Even if you ask us, we
can't find them for you.

1117
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,900
If they return and state
that they're just friends

1118
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,100
we can't take any
legal action on them.

1119
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,540
We don't have the right
to knock on their bedroom.

1120
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,220
Fine Sir, they've desired for it.

1121
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,700
It's better, if
they come to terms.

1122
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,380
They will be happy, no
matter where they are aunty.

1123
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,660
Don't worry!

1124
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,100
Only a woman can
understand another woman.

1125
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,580
They will stay together forever.

1126
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,660
Oh no!

1127
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,060
Can't you just shut up?

1128
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,780
Who do you think
would've first proposed?

1129
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,300
Guys shut up.

1130
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,460
Oh God! They've
embarrassed my family.

1131
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,860
Why am I even alive to
see all this nonsense.

1132
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,820
Seriously, can't you
guys shut for a while.

1133
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,540
This is Police station
not a funeral house.

1134
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,180
Please get out
from here, please.

1135
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:01,980
Sorry, Sir!

1136
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,300
Get out from here.

1137
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,020
Come let's leave.

1138
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,700
Hey!

1139
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,940
- Oh God no...!
- What happened?

1140
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,780
My husband is here, I'm screwed.

1141
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,860
Don't worry, I'm here.

1142
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,996
Your boyfriend is quite cool,
you don't have to worry.

1143
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,460
It's ok, I'm here
right, don't worry.

1144
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,980
Thamarai, Kajal
and I are leaving.

1145
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,020
- Ey!
- Ok, bye!

1146
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,460
All the best Thamarai.

1147
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,460
Come, it's ok.
I'll take care of it.

1148
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,540
What was it? Are you ok?

1149
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,620
Yeah.

1150
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,740
Listen...

1151
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,836
I've never been to a Police
station even during my case.

1152
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,116
- Everything is fine right?
- But you made me.

1153
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,220
No issue.

1154
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,620
- Get home, I'll take care of you.
- Get me one Tea.

1155
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,540
The worst of the times are here.

1156
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,500
Sir, it's not a rule
that only boys can smoke?

1157
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,300
Can't women smoke too, huh?

1158
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,980
Fine, do as per your will.

1159
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,860
- Ey...!
- Don't please

1160
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,420
I'm telling you
this one last time.

1161
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,500
Please don't do it

1162
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:58,660
I don't have any issues
with the way you live

1163
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:01,460
if at all I see your
girlfriend around my wife.

1164
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,100
- What will you do?
- I'll kill her.

1165
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,420
Come - Dear...

1166
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,820
Let it go, he's just angry.

1167
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,700
Unlike a regular man...

1168
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,340
he seems to understand a woman.

1169
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,820
Mmmm - He respects them

1170
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,820
I really like this
Venkat character.

1171
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,860
Even we used to like him a lot.

1172
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,340
But...!

1173
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,340
Hey!

1174
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,860
Will you marry me?

1175
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,380
Hey!

1176
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,540
I asked, 'will you marry me?'

1177
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,900
Huh!?

1178
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,060
Why don't have
to spoil the mood now?

1179
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,780
Why don't want to
get married to me?

1180
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,940
Huh!?

1181
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:04,420
Finding it hard to get
another pretty girl?

1182
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,900
I'm not in love with
you, for your looks.

1183
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,740
I've met girls, way
prettier than you.

1184
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,380
But I just love you
for, who you are.

1185
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,860
You don't get it,
how much I love you.

1186
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,940
We can very well be in
love, but can't get married.

1187
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,700
But I want to be married.

1188
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,700
That doesn't mean,
I want to get married.

1189
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,140
Don't you understand
my love for you?

1190
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,300
You don't have respect
for my feelings.

1191
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,580
Well, you don't respect
my feelings too.

1192
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,100
I'm persistent on
not getting married.

1193
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,420
But you don't seem
to understand.

1194
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,940
But I need a commitment.

1195
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,620
Does marriage
confirms commitment?

1196
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,476
Not necessary we have to
follow the usual path.

1197
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,740
It's not like that.

1198
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,620
If we're married, I will be
pacified that you're mine.

1199
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,540
I'm not a property to own.

1200
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,980
And I don't want to get married.

1201
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,780
If so, then we're done.

1202
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,500
Your wish.

1203
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,540
So, that's it - Ya!

1204
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,460
Don't forget to
leave the house keys.

1205
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:30,780
Damn it!

1206
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,660
A nice couple broke up. So sad.

1207
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,820
- Ah... thanks!
- Madam, I want tea too.

1208
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,340
Hey, do you drink tea too?

1209
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,500
Madam!

1210
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,060
Please give her one too.

1211
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,140
You can leave.

1212
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,940
So what happened next?

1213
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,140
After that...

1214
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,340
my husband moved
us out of that flat.

1215
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,580
He was constantly
keeping an eye on me.

1216
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,540
He even took away my phone,
'cause I used to speak to them.

1217
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,180
As time went by,
I lost touch with them.

1218
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,740
You guys had so much fun.

1219
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,660
If you're upset listening
to it, imagine my plight.

1220
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,900
That's why, we all met again.

1221
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,060
So once again you
guys got drunk?

1222
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,460
No madam, we just went
there to have juice.

1223
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,820
- Uh!?
- Mmmm.

1224
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,220
I believe you...!

1225
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,020
They're there.

1226
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,340
- Hey!
- Hi...!

1227
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,740
HI...!!!

1228
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,580
- Hello, how are you?
- I'm good!

1229
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,660
Hi!

1230
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,860
Guys, this is Christina.

1231
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,380
Hi.

1232
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,180
- How are you?
- Ya, good.

1233
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,860
Ma'am!

1234
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,860
One orange juice - Okay.

1235
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:36,980
One pista ice-cream

1236
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,500
- I will take the same.
- Ok, ma'am.

1237
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,020
- For you?
- Strawberry...

1238
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:40,980
That's it!

1239
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,740
Ok, thank you ma'am.

1240
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,860
So, are you guys happy right?

1241
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,940
Ya!

1242
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,060
It's all 'cause of you.

1243
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,580
I want to thank you girls.

1244
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:56,380
- Oh...!
- It's ok.

1245
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,660
It's you, who gave
me such courage.

1246
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,100
Hey, I didn't do anything.

1247
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,020
You're living your
life on your terms.

1248
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,180
That's about it.

1249
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,620
- Ey!
- Uh!

1250
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,860
Is everything
normal at home now?

1251
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,300
- Huh?
- Not yet...

1252
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,020
They haven't agreed
to it whole heartedly.

1253
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,140
Don't worry, they
will come to terms.

1254
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:16,980
You're right.

1255
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,340
'Cause of us you guys had
to go to Police station.

1256
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,660
Sorry - Hey... it's ok.

1257
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,300
No problem!

1258
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,140
Thank you!

1259
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,700
Shall we ask them, how
they exactly do it?

1260
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,980
Hey, just shut up.

1261
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,220
Mmmm ok.

1262
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,420
Hey, just look at them.

1263
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,180
She's cute though...

1264
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,100
Still how did you fall
in love with a girl?

1265
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,260
Whether it's a boy and a girl

1266
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,660
or it's between two girls.

1267
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,980
- Love is love!
- Exactly!

1268
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,340
Love... is... Love!

1269
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,140
- Love you baby.
- Love you too baby.

1270
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,460
You're guys are
so cute together.

1271
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,620
I'm planning to switch
sides and fall in love.

1272
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,980
- So Kajal, are you ready?
- Oh God, she's on now.

1273
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,260
Why not?

1274
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,020
What's wrong with me, huh?

1275
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,220
Hey, Rita!

1276
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:18,860
You're killing me.

1277
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,940
You guys are funny.

1278
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,020
Chris - Mmmm.

1279
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:35,860
If you weren't here, I would've
definitely fallen in love with Paru.

1280
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,980
Do you think, you will
love Suganya as I do?

1281
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,220
Are you that beautiful? Tell me.

1282
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,900
No one can come in between us.

1283
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,060
Understood?

1284
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,980
She was just kidding.

1285
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,380
Paru, didn't wanna ask something.

1286
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,820
- Ask them now.
- I don't want to risk it.

1287
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:00,580
Was it love at first sight?

1288
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,100
We're friends since school.

1289
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,660
Then we became best friends.

1290
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,300
Then we realized we had feelings
for each other in college.

1291
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,940
Who proposed first?

1292
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:12,220
We never proposed each other.

1293
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,380
Just an understanding.

1294
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,660
Just love!

1295
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,260
Do you know where we
made out first time?

1296
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,660
College bathroom.

1297
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,780
So... as Sugi and
Chris are here...

1298
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,020
we're going to party.

1299
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,500
- Yes!
- Ya.

1300
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,180
We can party, not an issue

1301
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,980
but If I drink, my
husband will find out.

1302
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,380
He'll kill me.

1303
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,860
Oh God!

1304
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,260
No drinking!

1305
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,020
I'm not able to wake early
to send Ria to school.

1306
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,540
- No drinks.
- It's not suiting me too

1307
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,100
I get a chronic
headache in the morning.

1308
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,700
That's right, let's not.

1309
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,060
So after that, you
guys never had drinks.

1310
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:51,860
We never did - Good!

1311
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,180
Very Good!

1312
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,260
Then why did your husband
brought you here today?

1313
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,980
Oh that...

1314
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,700
as drinks were
not agreeing with us

1315
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,220
we went on to

1316
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,820
try weed for a change.

1317
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,020
Ah!

1318
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,500
Hey, why kind of sketchy
place he brought us to.

1319
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:09,876
- What place is this?
- Let's see.

1320
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,300
- Guys!
- Yes.

1321
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,380
This is where we get pure weed.

1322
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:13,860
Oh!

1323
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,740
What do you mean by pure weed?

1324
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,396
Other places, they tend to mix rat
poison, but that's not the case out here.

1325
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,620
- Nice!
- Oh!

1326
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,940
- Come on, let's try.
- You'll feel it, when you have it.

1327
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,420
It's awesome.

1328
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,500
Come on.

1329
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,740
Hey buddy...

1330
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,700
they've come along to buy weed

1331
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,700
tonight we're going to
party with the girls.

1332
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,220
- Okay?
- Double okay.

1333
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,660
He will get his girl today

1334
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,420
I'll remain as single.

1335
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,300
Look over there,
romance is at peak.

1336
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,860
Why is this lady staring at us?

1337
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,220
- Hi Buddy!
- Hi.

1338
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:02,300
Looks like you workout everyday.

1339
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,620
Yeah.

1340
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:05,100
- Do you workout daily?
- Yes!

1341
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,180
See him.

1342
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,380
Hey be careful.

1343
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,460
- Hey!
- Buddy do you have a match?

1344
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,540
Hey!

1345
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,180
Buddy, why are you
giving me cold stares?

1346
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,820
It's fine if you don't have it

1347
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,900
why do you have to be so rude?

1348
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,860
We're close, it's this way.

1349
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:32,500
Hey, I think we've reached.

1350
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,140
It's through this.

1351
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,500
- Here is it?
- Yes.

1352
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,340
Ok.

1353
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,340
You guys don't come beyond this.

1354
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,420
Why?

1355
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,500
It gets worse as
we move further.

1356
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:42,900
What's this buddy?

1357
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:43,740
Come on buddy, let's go.

1358
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:46,420
Let go off my hand,
I'm a girl too.

1359
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,220
I'm serious, you guys
don't have to come.

1360
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,556
- We'll handle it.
- Please listen

1361
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,060
I'm right here, you guys don't
have to worry. Follow me.

1362
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,340
Fine, let's go.

1363
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,500
That's the house.

1364
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,460
Granny!

1365
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:27,860
Who is that?

1366
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,380
Granny, it's me.

1367
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,060
They're our friends - Yes.

1368
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,380
Oh is it. Fine,
get inside quick.

1369
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,980
Granny, take out your stash.

1370
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,700
Give me that basket.

1371
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:47,540
Basket?

1372
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,420
Does she sell weed, is it?

1373
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:50,716
Why does she need the basket?

1374
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,100
Why does she need it?

1375
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,820
- How many?
- 4 is enough.

1376
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,180
She has packed it
well and hid it.

1377
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,020
Give it to me.

1378
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,660
I don't use plastic bags.

1379
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,140
- Oh!
- How much is it?

1380
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:02,420
It's 1000 rupees.

1381
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,180
Buddy, I don't any money on me.

1382
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,356
I swear I don't
have money on me.

1383
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:06,140
I don't have it.

1384
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,980
Fine, I'll pay for it.

1385
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,340
Thank you.

1386
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,180
Who is inside?

1387
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:13,260
What happened?

1388
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,620
Open the door.

1389
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,620
Hey...

1390
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,500
It's Police.

1391
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,020
- Police, huh?
- Oh my God!

1392
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,196
You guys leave
from the back door.

1393
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,580
Come on, go... go... go.

1394
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:21,940
Run faster.

1395
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,340
It's ok.

1396
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,500
Come on, quick.

1397
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,820
Come on, Sugi.

1398
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,340
Keep running.

1399
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,900
Please stop right there.

1400
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,300
Come on, catch hold of them.

1401
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,756
Keep chasing them,
don't let them getaway.

1402
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,540
Catch them!

1403
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,260
Hey, I say you stop there.

1404
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,620
Come on, coast is clear.

1405
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,100
Come on quick.

1406
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:57,220
Come start the vehicle, quick.

1407
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,220
- Get inside quick.
- Get inside faster.

1408
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,420
I'm very much tired.

1409
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,700
Get something soon.

1410
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,300
That was awesome.

1411
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,140
It was great.

1412
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,980
Awesome it seems, idiot.

1413
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,820
Again, if I had gone
to the Police station.

1414
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,180
My husband would've killed me.

1415
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:25,580
That Police is way
better than your husband.

1416
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,060
Right!? This prison is
better than the other.

1417
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,620
Buddy, come on help me with it.

1418
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,700
- Look at him.
- Please understand.

1419
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,980
Get lost.

1420
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,100
Just this once.

1421
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,220
Hey, hope they don't
come looking for us.

1422
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:37,260
We'll handle it.

1423
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,500
If I was wearing a saree,
I would've rolled up and ran.

1424
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,940
There's not much
difference though.

1425
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,100
You could've rolled
up your skirt as well.

1426
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,540
Of course.

1427
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,100
You're right about it.

1428
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,260
This is only for us.

1429
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,020
Hey, I don't drink juice.

1430
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,980
So will you drink only liquor?

1431
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,060
- So will you get me booze?
- You can get one too.

1432
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,340
- Do you want this?
- No.

1433
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,740
Without knowing the matter
he's wooing her.

1434
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:04,540
He'll also get disappointed soon.

1435
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,420
Come on, finish up quickly.

1436
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,540
Yesss!

1437
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,820
We're going to party.

1438
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,780
There's beer at home,
you guys are welcome.

1439
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,820
No, this is girls only party.

1440
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,900
Only the beer is welcome.

1441
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,380
You're not welcome though.

1442
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,100
Ta Ta!

1443
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,100
- Hey!
- She's looking hot.

1444
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,140
Who is this Sexy lady?

1445
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,340
Does this look good?

1446
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,420
- I'm kind of nervous.
- You look super nice.

1447
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,100
Is this really good?

1448
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,820
God has been really
generous with you

1449
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,820
but with me he's
been quite stingy.

1450
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:43,140
If you itself complaint about it

1451
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,900
imagine my plight, God has
been a real miser with me.

1452
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,940
Oh God, poor thing.

1453
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,500
Chris has been totally
neglected by the God.

1454
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,020
Damn you woman.

1455
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,700
Hold on, I'll give you an idea.

1456
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,260
What?

1457
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,676
Is this where Ria's
socks are kept?

1458
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,020
Ya it's inside that.

1459
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:58,980
Come on, stuff them.

1460
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,060
Hey...!

1461
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,460
Come on, stuff them.

1462
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,180
Come on, get on with it.

1463
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,020
Oh no!

1464
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,420
Are you done with it?

1465
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:20,420
ROUND: 3 SIVA BHANAM

1466
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,700

1468
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:52,980
Give it to me.

1469
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:26,540
"Shiva Bhanam clawed into
me, twisting all my senses"

1470
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:31,140
"I'm totally not in my senses."

1471
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:36,100
"My head is spinning like
a staggering whirlwind."

1472
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:40,860
"Still there's a force within
which is paving its way out."

1473
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:45,700
"World seems to be smoking
up spinning like a ball."

1474
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:50,500
"Also it's questions
where I am headed to"

1475
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:55,340
"I've been running haywire
looking for answers"

1476
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:59,940
"I'm stranded clueless
at crossroads."

1477
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:28,580
"I saw the heaven blissfully"

1478
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:33,340
"I am in cloud nine
Enjoyed a lot."

1479
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:38,100
"Sambo Siva Sambo-Sambo,
Siva... Siva Sambo."

1480

"Sambo Siva Sambo-Sambo,
Siva... Siva Sambo."

1481
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:35,660
"Sky faded away, so
did our sorrows vanish."

1482
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:40,180
"Laughter is dominating
us at the moment."

1483
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:45,820
"Clueless on what is
happening to our bodies"

1484
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,140
"we've been drifting away."

1485
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,420
"Hey... Hey"

1486
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,460
"I'm seeing God
standing in front of me."

1487
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,020
"Feels flying with wings
and floating over the sky."

"I am in cloud nine
Enjoyed a lot."

"Timid... shyness
A feeling of embarrassment."

1495
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:32,660
"Fear of emotion."

1496
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,580
"Wake up... come out."

1497
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:38,700

01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:03,220
But I'm not able to cry.

1502
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:07,140
Didn't we shift to weed, 'cause

01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:56,820
Off late, he hasn't

01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,060

01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,940
Look Kajal has
been sleeping here.

1553
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:08,340
She's in deep sleep,
unaware that we're here.

1554
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,220
Ey, wake up.

1555
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,660
Kajal - Wake up.

Who...?

1558
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:18,380
She's not able to
even recognize us.

1559
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,780
Where is fridge?

1560
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:22,740

1561
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:23,340
Look here.

1562
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:24,420
- Abhi!
- Isn't this Kajal?

1563
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,300
Kajal is not here.

1564
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,756
Don't you understand,
please get out.

1565
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:27,780
Abhi, what's happening?

1566
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,820
What are you guys doing?
Better get out from here.

1567
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,580
I've been telling you guys to leave.

1568
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,620
Get lost.

1569
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,540
Come on, you come on damn it.

1570
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:35,460
Let go off me, idiot.

1571
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,500
I'm hungry!

1572
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,380
Sit down let's talk.

1573
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:39,380
Don't touch me.

1574
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,340
At least give us
something to drink.

1575
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:43,276
- Her face doesn't looks like Kajal though.
- Yes, your right.

1576
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:43,940
Who are you guys?

1577
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,420
Why her nose like this?

1578
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,220
Abhishek, call the Police.

1579
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,060
You've barged in like
a dog inside the house.

1580
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:52,580
- She's definitely not Kajal.

1581
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:55,180
- Paru, Paru... come over here.
- Come on dear.

1582
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:56,780
Does she even look like Kajal?

1583
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,076
Can't you hear what I am saying?

1584
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,340
- Who sent you guys over here?
- Is it Kajal?

1585
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:02,620
If you guys don't leave,
I'll call the police.

1586
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,460
I will...!

1587
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:05,500
Ey... how dare you?

1588
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,660
We've been so nice to Kajal.

1589
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,500
Why have been barging
in like a smart cookie?

1590
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,340
I'm being a gentlemen
not raising my hand

1591
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,100
if not, what will you do, idiot?

1592
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:15,580
Ey... don't harm him.

1593
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:17,860
Look at him.

1594
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,860
She's worried as
if she's your wife.

1595
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,220
Rita!

1596
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,340
- I should...
- Rita, don't.

1597
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,460
Shameless!

1598
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,676
If at all I see you
around that house

1599
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,620
Rita...

1600
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,060
I'll kill you - Hey!

1601
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:31,260
Come on, let's leave.
I'm hungry.

1602
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,540
Shucks - Come on.

1603
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,860
You don't have anything
in the house, useless.

1604
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,660
- Squatter!
- Abhishek.

1605
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,700
Come on.

1606
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,300
Are you sure Kattan
will be here?

1607
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,940
He will come for sure

1608
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,020
I Vengaiyan's Son...

1609
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,020
Am standing alone.

1610
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,660
Come on, if you have the guts!

1611
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,060
Hey!

1612
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:52,420
That's your husband.

1613
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:12,060
Come on, come on.

1614
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:14,580
Go.

1615
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,980
Oh no - Keep moving.

1616
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:22,900
Come on, take cover.

1617
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,940
Come on...

1618
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,180
Get inside the car.

1619
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:02,020
Your sense of style is
not giving me good vibes.

1620
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,860
And that too the
make-up is tad bit much.

1621
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,500
The make-up was good though.

1622
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:06,860
Has it worn out?

1623
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,300
Baby has it worn out?

1624
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:10,940
Come on patch up your make-up.

1625
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,860
You're being spoiled
by these women.

1626
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:14,620
Yes.

1627
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,340
How did you find that out?

1628
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,980
Just now we made such a ruckus.

1629
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:21,980
Yay, Yay, Yay, Yay!

1630
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:25,900
If I find you again with
these drunk wretches.

1631
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,740
Don't call my friends like that

1632
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,820
they'll be ready to give
up their life for me.

1633
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,780
You're such a sweet baby.

1634
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,100
Why are you embarrassing
me like this?

1635
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:35,940
I swear, I didn't drink.

1636
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,460
I know you get angry, If I do

1637
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,900
I truly didn't.

1638
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,620
Thamarai is telling the truth.

1639
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,700
What are you guys blabbering?

1640
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,860
What is that smell?

1641
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,220
Smell?

1642
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:50,300
That's nothing but bug poison.

1643
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,900
It's the work of the booze.

1644
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,500
Bug Poison!?

1645
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,820
Like how we mangled Abhishek

1646
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,100
do you think your
husband can take that?

1647
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:04,220
If only he had gun with him,
he might have nailed it.

1648
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:06,620
As if he was
capable of doing it.

1649
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:11,380
All he had in his
house was stale chips.

1650
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,940
Come over to my place

1651
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,780
we all shall have
the bug poison.

1652
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,980
You are right.

1653
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:24,860
Kajal!

1654
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:28,380
You should just like
this, always smiling.

1655
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:30,380
Hey, stop pissing me off.

1656
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,140
If you keep laughing,
I'll shoot you guys.

1657
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:33,420
Please don't dear...

1658
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,700
you're a reputed rowdy

1659
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:37,780
don't degrade yourself
by shooting us down.

1660
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,580
She's absolutely right.

1661
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:41,420
Don't get angry.

1662
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:44,620
You alone come home
and shoot me only.

1663
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,060
I smell something weird.

1664
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,220
Oh that...

1665
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,660
we just had a wee bit of weed.

1666
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:52,980
Did you say weed?

1667
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:01,460
Why have you been
annoying me lately?

1668
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,940
Please forgive me.

1669
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:06,940
Hereafter, I won't
have beer, wine or weed

1670
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,700
I'll let go off
it, for your sake.

1671
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:11,100
Just like how I let
go off my parents.

1672
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:12,460
She got emotional.

1673
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,260
Please don't be angry, dear.

1674
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,300
I love you so much.

1675
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,060
Hey stop the car right now.

1676
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,500
Stop the car, car, car, car...

1677
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,780
Ey... have this.

1678
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,700
- You know, Pandi right?
- Yes.

1679
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,380
He hangs out with
him all the time.

1680
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,620
Is that so?

1681
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:46,300
It'll be great if he quits
that and find another job.

1682
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:48,620
Kattan was not there, boss.

1683
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,620
I'll be done with it soon.

1684
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:53,500
- Please eat well.
- All you guys have a partner.

1685
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,380
But me...

1686
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:56,420
I'll finish him.

1687
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,180
Brother, get me a egg parotta.

1688
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:59,900
- One for me too.
- She's incorrigible.

1689
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:04,580
Do whatever you feel like...

1690
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:07,100
but for God sake don't cry.

1691
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:08,580
You guys are so loving

1692
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,460
I'll give up my life for you.

1693
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,620
No one has been so
affectionate to me.

1694
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:15,460
That doesn't mean, you
have to go back to him.

1695
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,500
Better not.

1696
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:18,180
Please stop crying.

1697
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,980
These are not sad tears

1698
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:22,180
but the happy ones.

1699
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,660
My poor haunted bungalow...

1700
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:30,700
I wonder who will befriend it.

1701
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:33,020
We'll get you a guy,
who'll befriend it.

1702
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,660
You don't worry about it?

1703
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,860
My bungalow has
never been christened.

1704
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,340
What did you say?

1705
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:40,460
- What!?
- Mmmm.

1706
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,900
I think I'm running
a temperature.

1707
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,260
You got fever?

1708
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:49,740
Nothing to worry about.

1709
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,300
You please go and sleep.

1710
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:03,860
Shit!

1711
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,140
Come on, that's a good strike.

1712
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:16,780
Yayy... Kohli just scored a six.

1713
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,260
Come on, keep at it.
That's a good shot.

1714
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,500
Why are straining yourself,
here have some chips.

1715
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:33,780
I'm feeling cold.

1716
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,020
You're cold?

1717
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:38,420
Shall I switch off the AC?

1718
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,860
That was a good drive,
he's playing a good game.

1719
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:48,220
That's a good game.

1720
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:53,180
- When will you be done?
- It'll be late in the night

1721
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,780
I'll switch off the
lights, you sleep.

1722
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:27,980
Hey!

1723
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,940
What is it? What happened?

1724
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:34,180
I thought it was a cockroach.

1725
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,100
- Is this how you startle a person?
- Mmmm.

1726
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:38,940
Fine, go to sleep. Goodnight.

1727
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,580
Damn it!

1728
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:46,900
Sleep dear!

1729
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,940
Sleep dear!

1730
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,140
Sleep dear!

1731
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:53,020
Sleep dear!

1732
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:56,500
He has an excuse
everyday for it.

1733
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:59,580
Every time, he is
just about the sleep.

1734
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:01,660
When I hear that...

1735
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:07,100
I have no clue, why
he's avoiding me.

1736
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,540
On top of it, his mother...

1737
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:14,220
she's torturing asking
me, when I'll have kids.

1738
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,460
May he has a faulty remote.

1739
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:20,260
If you put a battery,
it should work.

1740
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:23,340
First, we need to check if
there's a remote in place

1741
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:25,460
then we'll worry about
putting a battery in it.

1742
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:27,860
- Oh poor thing.
- Why have you been mum about it

1743
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,860
I have a younger sister...

1744
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:32,236
that's why I'm
being quiet about it.

1745
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:33,260
I will...!

1746
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:36,660
How long will you
bear this nonsense?

1747
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,476
Damn it, why don't you
confront that asshole.

1748
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,740
Hey, what's with the language?

1749
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,860
Enough of food, leave from here.

1750
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,620
Enough of being patient.

1751
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:47,140
It's time, you open up
your locked bungalow.

1752
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:55,900
Ey... wake up.

1753
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,180
What is your problem?

1754
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,180
Why are you not
intimate with me?

1755
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:04,180
Don't you find me sexy?

1756
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:06,780
Don't you have any
feelings for me?

1757
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,740
I too have feelings.

1758
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,420
Why don't you understand that?

1759
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:12,620
Come on, do something.

1760
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,900
If not, say that
you don't like me.

1761
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:17,540
Don't you like me?

1762
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:19,380
Tell me, tell me.

1763
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:21,820
Tell me, tell me.

1764
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:23,700
- Don't you like me?
- It's not that.

1765
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,540
Don't you like me?

1766
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,340
Paru, you're very beautiful.

1767
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,460
You're very desirable.

1768
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:38,220
I was in love with another girl.

1769
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,980
But my family
didn't agree to it.

1770
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,660
They forced me
into this marriage.

1771
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:43,220
I'm not able to get over her.

1772
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,300
But, we still love each other.

1773
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:48,980
Everyone gets just
one life to live.

1774
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,180
You can live with the
girl, who you love.

1775
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:53,620
- What about our marriage?
- I care nothing about it.

1776
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,940
Just a formal
arrangement won't cut it.

1777
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:02,140
We'll be together, until my
younger sister gets married.

1778
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:03,860
After that let's get a divorce.

1779
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:06,100
I don't care about your
intentions with that girl.

1780
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:07,380
I don't care.

1781
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,620
Come on get back to sleep.

1782
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:11,180
You can sleep well now.

1783
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,580
Do you truly love me?

1784
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:24,340
You started your rant again.

1785
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,260
Tell me!

1786
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:29,420
That's right
you're my only love.

1787
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:32,620
Will you do something for me?

1788
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:33,740
Tell me!

1789
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,660
Quit working for Pandi.

1790
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:38,260
I'll think about it.

1791
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:56,620
Super.

1792
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:01,660
Just 'cause there's a design set by
the society, the way women should live

1793
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:04,100
it's utter foolishness to live
a life which you don't favour.

1794
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:06,700
You should always live
life on your terms.

1795
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:09,060
You're not obligated to
let go off your happiness.

1796
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:10,980
You sound just like Rita.

1797
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,740
Ey... how long will
keep chatting up?

1798
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:20,900
Madam, not sure if
she mentioned it.

1799
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:24,060
She's been smoking up and
drinking along with those girls

1800
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:26,660
please get her out of
that puddle of mess.

1801
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:31,940
Don't you smoke or drink?

1802
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,220
I was doing it...

1803
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,380
but when she started
with these habits.

1804
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:37,460
Since then, I feel
disgusted looking at it.

1805
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,380
I can concur stating if wives start to get
a taste of it, you guys will stop it too.

1806
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:42,540
Am I right?

1807
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:44,980
Let that go, ma'am.

1808
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:49,220
Please advice her not to
hang out with those girls.

1809
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:51,100
Firstly, ask him to
quit working for Pandi.

1810
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,460
Then I'll think about
leaving my friends.

1811
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:54,820
Look here...

1812
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:57,900
it's better if you
behave well with your wife

1813
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:00,460
if you do, then she'll
definitely listen to you.

1814
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,460
Ok, did you understand?

1815
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,500
Please wait outside
for 5 minutes...

1816
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:05,740
I'll send Thamarai too.

1817
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,300
He's portraying as if
I'm a chronic addict.

1818
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:13,900
We just tried once
on a occasion.

1819
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,300
Then poured out our hearts
to each other, that's it.

1820
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:19,020
It's ok, I understand.

1821
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:21,340
You met your friends without
your husband's knowledge.

1822
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:24,380
But please keep away
from this fixation.

1823
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,420
Ok!?

1824
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:26,580
Ok Madam.

1825
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:31,100
Hey Thamarai, you guys must've
definitely a plan in place

1826
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,740
when are you meeting
your friends next?

1827
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:34,180
New Year is around the corner.

1828
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,180
So...

1829
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:38,220
we've planned to go clubbing.

1830
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:40,860
Oh my God!

1831
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,980
ROUND 4: EXTREMELY-HIGH

1832
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:48,780
(SONG FROM SAKALAKALA VALLAVAN)

1833
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:52,100
Ey...! Stop it, Stop it, Stop it.

1834
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,260
Stop it!

1835
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,660
We're tired of the same
song every New Year!

1836
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:59,340
I need a new song.

1837
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:03,300
It's New Year Eve!

1838
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,300
Let's get sloshed!

1839
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:11,100
My dear lovelies from
another mother, worldwide.

1840
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:14,780
Wish you a Happy New Year!

1841
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:20,020
Let's get Dead-Sloshed!

1842
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:29,700
"New Year's Eve,
let's get sloshed."

1843
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:34,300
"Tonight, everything is viable."

1844
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:35,580
"Hit it!"

1845
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:46,780
"New Year's Eve,
let's get sloshed."

1846
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,260
"Tonight, everything is viable."

1847
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:51,700
"Dispose your
antics on the rocks."

1848
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:54,260
"Tamizhan's song always rocks!"

1849
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,380
"Weight-U!"

1850
01:45:58,860 --> 01:45:59,860
"Weight-U!"

1851
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:02,420
"Weight-U!"

1852
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,980
"haven't moved on from my Ex."

1853
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:09,620
"Income hasn't
seen a hike a bit."

1854
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:11,980
"Looking at the bottle,
we forget our past."

1855
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,860
"This year is gonna be
ours, let's take a break."

1856
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:36,460
"No clue in what's
happening around."

1857
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:39,100
"New Year is around
the corner in a jiffy."

1858
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:41,556
"We'll preach not to love, so
will quit drinking and smoking"

1859
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:44,580
"finally we'll end up
doing the same crap."

1860
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:56,420
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1861
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:59,020
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1862
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:00,500
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1863
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,860
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1864
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:04,660
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1865
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:16,300
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1866
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,900
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1867
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,060
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1868
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,260
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1869
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,740
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1870
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,100
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1871
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,660
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1872
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:29,260
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1873
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,580
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1874
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:31,660
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1875
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,060
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1876
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,940
That's all you got!?

1877
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:48,300
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1878
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:50,860
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1879
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,380
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1880
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:54,140
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1881
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:56,860
"Dead-Sloshed!"

1882
01:47:58,060 --> 01:47:59,620
That dance was slick!

1883
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:02,940
Paru, now that you're divorced,
what's your next move?

1884
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:05,860
I'm going to travel
and hook up with guys.

1885
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:08,460
- Ey...!
- She's spot on

1886
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,180
I too need to hook up.

1887
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:12,140
Even I want to experience
this 'Get together'

1888
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:13,700
Ah... get together-uh!?

1889
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:15,340
That's called Live-in together.

1890
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:17,740
- Ya, that's what I meant to say.
- So what about you too?

1891
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:19,140
We are getting married.

1892
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:21,060
- Aahhh!
- Wow!

1893
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,140
Nice...!

1894
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,940
Getting married is fine
though but what about kids?

1895
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,060
She's right though,
what about it?

1896
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,060
Don't look at me

1897
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,260
I can't wear my jeans then.
Sugi will have a baby.

1898
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,180
- What!?
- Ya!

1899
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:36,420
Nice try, I'm not doing it.

1900
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,940
I'm serious...

1901
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:40,460
if you wish to have kid,
then you get pregnant.

1902
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:42,660
Ey... is this like Vicky Donor?

1903
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:46,740
- Ey!
- That would be great, send him.

1904
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:50,100
Hey, let us all stay the same.

1905
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:53,300
You're right, come here.
Let's stay the same forever.

1906
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,380
What happened Thamarai?

1907
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,780
Ey... Ey! Stop the bike.

1908
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:07,140
- Uh!?
- Where's Pandi?

1909
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:09,660
Oh, you're look
for brother Pandi.

1910
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,700
Come with me.

1911
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:11,900
- Ey!
- Come on.

1912
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:12,980
Don't you lay hands on me.

1913
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,020
Ey...!

1914
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:15,540
Hey!

1915
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,500
Come on!

1916
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:38,140
Ey.

1917
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,180
Ey...!

1918
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,180
Come on!

1919
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,620
Hello!

1920
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,700
Ey... Sathish, where are you?

1921
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:32,980
Why is it taking so long?

1922
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,780
- Come sooner.
- I'll be there soon

1923
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:36,340
I'm almost there boss, almost...

1924
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,380
Ey... Thamarai!

1925
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:51,060
What are you doing here?

1926
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:52,180
Hey!!

1927
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:54,940
Your wife is drunk
with these girls...

1928
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:56,300
entered my den

1929
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:57,940
and pointing a gun to my head.

1930
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:58,820
It's not that, boss.

1931
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,460
Hope you remember who I am.

1932
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:04,180
I thought Pandi was
a big freaking Co...

1933
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,540
Gangster!

1934
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,980
Look at him sitting
like a school kid.

1935
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:11,660
School kid is it?

1936
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,380
Just untie me, then
you'll know my thrust

1937
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:16,620
what were you up to, when
we were tying you up?

1938
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,020
Hey! Thamarai.

1939
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:21,660
Please give that gun to me.

1940
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:23,700
Don't come closer,
I'll shoot him.

1941
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:26,180
- Hey...!
- Come on shoot him Thamarai.

1942
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:30,300
I just learned how to use
a gun, give it to me.

1943
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:31,340
Please don't.

1944
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:32,580
Please listen to me.

1945
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:33,980
First you got to load bullets.

1946
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,460
Give me the gun - Then lock it.

1947
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,340
Finally you press the
trigger and shoot.

1948
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,940
Give that to me, let
me give it a shot.

1949
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:40,980
You take a shot sweety.

1950
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:42,500
Did you just say a trial.

1951
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,940
First take the
gun away from them.

1952
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:45,500
Hey Sugi, please
be a little careful.

1953
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:47,260
It's better if you
give the gun to me.

1954
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:56,180
That's awesome, let
me give it a shot too.

1955
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:00,300
They're playing with the gun
and you're just staring at them.

1956
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:01,180
It's not that, boss.

1957
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,740
Please do something, Sathish.

1958
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:07,260
Ey...!

1959
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:09,540
Hey!

1960
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:11,420
Now, let me give it a try.

1961
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:15,540
Shall I point and shoot it?

1962
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:17,100
What's wrong with you women?

1963
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:18,980
Sathish, you dumbo do something.

1964
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:22,220
You aren't quitting
'cause of him right

1965
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,700
I'll kill him
myself, give me that.

1966
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:25,380
Hey, don't do it Thamarai.

1967
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:26,820
Hey, Sathish...

1968
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:28,940
how do you manage
to live with her?

1969
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:31,860
You're better off
working for me.

1970
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,340
Hey, Thamarai

1971
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:37,260
I beg of you, please
give me the gun

1972
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,100
I won't!

1973
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:39,940
Everything will be
alright, if I kill him.

1974
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:41,596
- Ey... Ey, Thamarai.
- What are you doing?

1975
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:42,900
Hey, you might shoot him.

1976
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:45,220
If I take a shot here,
you'll die right?

1977
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,500
Ey... shoot his brains out.

1978
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:49,260
Does he have a brain though?

1979
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,580
Is it here, or at least here?

1980
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,300
He doesn't have
any brains though.

1981
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:55,620
Then how will he die?

1982
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,220
You're right!

1983
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:59,100
Then shoot his nose.

1984
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:01,780
Thamarai, don't... don't.

1985
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:03,596
- They're playing with me.
- You'll kill him, careful.

1986
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:05,436
- Thamarai listen to me.
- She's fixated on killing me.

1987
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:08,100
Sathish, please do something
don't just stand still.

1988
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:10,380
Please Thamarai, I beg of you.

1989
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,540
Give me that gun.

1990
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:13,500
Ey... stop begging her.

1991
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:15,620
Take the gun away from her.

1992
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,820
Thamarai, why are
you doing this?

1993
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:22,220
If something goes wrong
with you, I can't take it.

1994
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,420
Do you know how much I love?

1995
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:27,620
You're lying to me.

1996
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,180
I swear

1997
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:30,860
I do love you.

1998
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:31,620
Is that so?

1999
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,380
Then tell me how
much you love me?

2000
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:34,740
What do you mean by that?

2001
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:36,540
A lot!

2002
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:38,740
Fine, recite a poem.

2003
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:42,940
Huh!

2004
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:45,500
There are so many
stars in the sky.

2005
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:46,540
That much.

2006
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:51,100
Just like the extent
of sand at the beach.

2007
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:53,100
Damn it!

2008
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:58,020
Instead of listening to this
crap it's better I shoot myself.

2009
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:03,460
I never heard such
a lame poetry.

2010
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:07,460
Hey, don't be so rude.

2011
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:08,780
It is good though.

2012
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:09,380
Thamarai!

2013
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:10,180
Oh... Oh!

2014
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,140
I swear, will quit
working for Pandi.

2015
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:13,740
Are you sure about it?

2016
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:14,700
I am sure!

2017
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:16,820
Don't listen to him. He's lying!

2018
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:18,300
Don't trust him, he's lying.

2019
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:19,620
- Ey!
- Yes...

2020
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,820
My husband is an honest rowdy.

2021
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:25,540
He will never go
back on his word.

2022
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:29,500
Hey, Thamarai
don't go over there.

2023
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,340
He's trying to
trick you into this.

2024
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:34,780
Hey!

2025
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:38,540
Enough of romantic antics
first cut me loose.

2026
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:45,260
Boss, I'm really sorry.
It was not her intention though.

2027
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:46,420
Don't untie him.

2028
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,340
- Sorry, Boss!
- Don't untie him.

2029
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:51,260
- Boss, boss, boss...
- Move away.

2030
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:53,500
- Hey...!
- Boss, please don't.

2031
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:57,780
Boss, please don't harm her
It was unintentional.

2032
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:59,540
She was high, please
forgive her...

2033
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:02,220
Just 'cause I'm bald, you
pecked me for a queer...

2034
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:03,260
Not like that boss.

2035
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,340
Five women will point
a gun to my head.

2036
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:07,820
Do you expect me to keep calm?

2037
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:10,580
Boss, I've always
obeyed your orders.

2038
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:13,140
I've done a lot for you
Please listen to me, boss.

2039
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:14,276
Let her go, and forgive her.

2040
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:16,060
Why the heck should
I listen to you?

2041
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:17,916
Your wife is the first
one to bite the bullet.

2042
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:19,780
Just watch - Boss, don't shoot.

2043
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:20,740
Just watch - Hey... don't.

2044
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:22,100
Ey... Ey!

2045
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:23,620
Ey... let go off me.

2046
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:33,540
Hey!

2047
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:36,460
Just kill him.

2048
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:38,700
Shall I shoot you down?

2049
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:39,860
Huh!?

2050
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:41,460
Shall I?

2051
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:42,860
Rita, kill him.

2052
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:45,620
- Shall I shoot?
- Do you know I'm a big gangster?

2053
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:47,340
Ey...!

2054
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:49,860
Freakin' I've handled Bigg Boss.

2055
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:01,060
- Buddy!
- Tell me buddy.

2056
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:02,500
Did you see what happened?

2057
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:04,580
We're invited for Thamarai's
birthday this year.

2058
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,300
Awesome!

2059
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:07,620
If we're persistent
with something

2060
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:09,540
we'll succeed for sure.
That's great buddy.

2061
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:11,140
We're going to party with them.

2062
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:12,860
We're going to party
with Paru today

2063
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,820
that's right buddy,
come on high-five.

2064
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:17,260
Brother, brother...

2065
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:19,500
Sorry, did I just graze you?

2066
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,100
Brother, give us 12 beers.

2067
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:23,380
Did I just graze you too?

2068
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:27,820
Brother, come on
give us 12 beers.

2069
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:29,500
Brother, come on brother...

2070
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,580
make it quick.

2071
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:34,780
As usual, I've lied to
my husband to get out.

2072
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:37,460
Hey, you're still
lying to your husband?

2073
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,860
No other option, he doesn't seem
to understand our friendship.

2074
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,060
Are you happy?

2075
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:44,180
I'm very happy.

2076
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:45,580
- Great!
- He's very caring

2077
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,700
regular to his work,
what else do I need?

2078
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:48,780
Oh... Ok!

2079
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:50,180
What about other stuff?

2080
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:53,700
That doesn't seem important now.

2081
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:54,420
Hey...!

2082
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,020
Hey, I swear!

2083
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:58,500
- But Rita...
- Huh!

2084
01:56:58,540 --> 01:56:59,460
It's all 'cause of you.

2085
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,820
She's right, only after
you spoke to our parents

2086
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:03,820
they've begun
slowly to accept us.

2087
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:04,860
That's right.

2088
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:07,220
It's 'cause of you, I've
got a clarity in my life.

2089
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:08,180
Oh, come on!

2090
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:11,260
Thanks a lot for getting
me a job at your salon.

2091
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:14,060
That's enough guys wrap
up the sentiments.

2092
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,900
Hey, let's start the party.

2093
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:19,820
Hey Rita, you open
the first bottle.

2094
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:22,660
I stopped drinking and smoking

2095
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:24,260
I've become very
health conscious.

2096
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:25,300
Oh...!

2097
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,660
Girls, come on let's start then.

2098
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,940
When Rita isn't drinking,
then I'm not going to

2099
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,820
we don't want too.

2100
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,820
Buddy, let's get high on life.

2101
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:37,180
What's happening?

2102
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:40,020
So we can't have drinks
with them anymore.

2103
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:43,500
It's all done.

2104
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:46,420
Why don't you get
me a green tea?

2105
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,620
- Did you say green tea?
- Yes!

2106
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:50,540
- Hey!
- Please, please.

2107
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:51,620
Order juice for us.

2108
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:53,260
That's right juice will do.

2109
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:55,460
Ah... please!

2110
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:57,900
Bye!

2111
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,820
Hey, poor thing.

2112
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:02,140
They look so sad.

2113
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:03,580
Fine, we all are happy now.

2114
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:05,580
When are you going to be happy?

2115
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:07,940
Why!? I'm like forever happy?

2116
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:09,340
I choose to be happy.

2117
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:11,260
Hey don't lie to us.

2118
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,580
Don't you miss Venky?

2119
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,140
I miss him a lot.

2120
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:18,020
I was heartbroken,
but I've moved on.

2121
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,980
I can't be moping over this.

2122
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:22,540
Rita, why don't you marry Venky?

2123
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:23,900
That's right!

2124
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:26,180
If I get married,
I won't be myself.

2125
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:29,740
I love myself
I don't want to change.

2126
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:32,180
And moreover, Venky is married.

2127
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,780
Ah! What are you saying?

2128
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:35,900
You guys don't get
sentimental over this.

2129
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:38,260
One day, I'll meet
someone like me.

2130
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:40,060
Hey, what's that noise?

2131
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:42,100
So, you won't marry me?

2132
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:44,820
How do you explain being
together for all these days?

2133
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:46,180
It's all a ruse, right?

2134
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:48,980
You've thrown away
our relationship.

2135
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:52,980
But I've been
loving you like mad.

2136
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:55,580
Please understand,
I love you so much.

2137
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:58,220
And I need a commitment from you.

2138
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:01,700
Does marriage
certify commitment?

2139
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:04,940
That's when, we'll
belong to each other.

2140
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:11,900
Look, marriage... commitment
it never works out for me.

2141
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:14,340
Hey, he speaks your lingo.

2142
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:15,500
Ok!

2143
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:18,100
Then we're done, let's break-up.

2144
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:19,260
Are you sure?

2145
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:20,580
Yes, I'm sure.

2146
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,300
Ok cool.

2147
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:24,620
Hope you wake up.

2148
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:40,300
Buddy, that was a mess.

2149
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:41,700
We're drinking alone now.

2150
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:44,220
Excuse me!
Do you guys have cigarettes?

2151
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,820
Yes we do, take this bro.

2152
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:47,780
Hi bro, would you
like have a beer?

2153
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:51,580
Do I look like your bro?

2154
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:53,940
Being like a crow though...

2155
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:56,500
But you think, I'm your bro.

2156
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:00,220
Trusting women has given
us a lot of stuff

2157
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:03,540
I too have received
a lot trusting women.

2158
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:05,260
Bro, inside you spoke well.

2159
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:09,740
You can only speak out, what's inside
of you what can I do, if it's good.

2160
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:11,180
Awesome, bro!

2161
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:14,740
Bro, how to really
impress a girl?

2162
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:16,460
I've tried every
trick in the book.

2163
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,380
But none seem to be impressed.

2164
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:20,180
What will exactly impress women?

2165
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:22,940
Speak the truth, women
will be impressed.

2166
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:24,100
That's awesome!

2167
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:26,780
That doesn't mean, you got to speak
the truth once she's impressed.

2168
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:28,740
Then she'll move
on to someone else.

2169
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:29,620
You're right.

2170
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:32,380
Boss, I'm your fan now.

2171
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:34,420
Me too - Then follow me.

2172
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:35,940
Can I ask you one thing?

2173
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:37,580
Why did you reject that girl?

2174
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:40,100
Do you believe you'll find
someone just like you?

2175
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:42,460
But one thing is for sure...

2176
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,780
I swear I don't think you
can find a girl like that.

2177
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:47,460
Hey, if you don't
believe in yourself

2178
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:50,900
then how do you expect
a girl to trust you?

2179
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:52,540
First you believe in yourself.

2180
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:53,900
Then you'll find the one

2181
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:55,260
come looking for you.

2182
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:57,180
Excuse me!

2183
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,260
You loved her right?
Why don't you marry her?

2184
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:03,020
I did say I love her, but
never said will marry her.

2185
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:05,180
So if you love someone, you
won't get married is it?

2186
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:06,956
Is it mandatory to get
married if you're in love?

2187
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:08,420
Then why did you love her?

2188
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:13,980
I loved her, 'cause
I really liked her.

2189
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:17,580
I can't get married to
confirm my integrity.

2190
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:18,820
Are you sure?

2191
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:20,740
You won't change
your mind, right?

2192
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:23,180
My heart has been never
confused in these matters.

2193
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:25,780
But the hearts of my loved
ones did change though.

2194
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,700
I'm just like you.

2195
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:39,620
Where were you all this while?

2196
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,540
Where were you all this while?

2197
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,956
- Won't you tell me before you do this?
- Look at them...

2198
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:48,700
I'm really confused
and my head is spinning

2199
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,340
you won't change
your mind right?

2200
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:51,300
Definitely not!

2201
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,020
Then come on, we'll manage.

2202
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:08,460
"Let's witness the world,
through the eyes of a bird"

2203
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:13,380
"we're that God, who
isn't trapped in a idol"

2204
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:18,380
"we've stepped over hurdles
and have come a long way"

2205
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:23,500
"attained ecstasy
without compromises."

2206
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:31,580
"Vibrant colors are blooming,
beyond the borders of a saree"

2207
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:41,580
"it's time to rest the heart, which
kept screaming all this while."

2208
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:58,460
"Pave a path for yourself,
don't be dependent."

2209
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:04,140
"The path you choose
will bloom success."

2210
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:12,180
"New phase of life blooms, at
every rotation of this earth"
