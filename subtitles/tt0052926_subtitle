3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,440
Some vehicle is coming.

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,940
Hello, sir.

5
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,106
Sardarji, we have to
search your truck.

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,526
Why, what's the matter?

7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,110
We have information that a man has
escaped with gold from Bombay.

8
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,030
So as if he has come in my truck.
This is too much.

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,826
It's our duty
to search every vehicle.

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,020
Sure, go ahead, who's stopping you?

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,940
Search the vehicle.

12
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,950
There he is!

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,900
Arrest him. Bring him along!

14
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,960
I hope Ranjit, that you will
try to be an honest man.

15
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,130
Yes.

16
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,930
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

17
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,000
- What's being constructed here?
- A dam.

18
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,086
- Dam?
- Yes.

19
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,350
- But there was just a jungle here.
- That was 3-4 years ago.

20
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,630
- Yes.
- With the construction, lots of people have settled here.

21
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,870
Good day.

22
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,996
- Where's the boss?
- Over there.

23
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,220
Call him.

24
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,950
- Sir, someone wants to see you.
- Okay.

25
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,430
- Hello, sir.
- Hello. What is it?

26
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,340
As per your orders,
I've been following him from jail.

27
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,080
- He has come here.
- So my guess was right.

28
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,976
Where's he now?

29
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,320
He got off the bus and went to
the bazaar, and I came here.

30
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,070
Look, ask Chandar and Bahadur
to keep a watch on him...

31
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,730
and inform me of everything
they learn about him.

32
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,970
Got it? I'll be
home in the evening.

33
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,450
It's this tree! It is!

34
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,970
Hey! who are you?
What are you looking at?

35
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,030
Nothing. I was
watching your swing.

36
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,700
What's different about it?

37
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,660
Seeing it, I was
reminded of my childhood.

38
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,660
- Really?
- Yes.

39
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,040
Sister has come!

40
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,676
- Yes sister?
- Who are you talking to?

41
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,900
With him.

42
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,080
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

43
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,040
- Who did you ask to come in?
- So many questions in one go?

44
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,280
Just answer what is asked.
Who did you ask to come in?

45
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,880
I've come here on my own.

46
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,880
Indeed! How could you dare
to enter a stranger's house?

47
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,610
Why stranger?
I consider everyone dear to me.

48
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,140
What! Consider everyone dear?
Why have you come? Answer that.

49
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,850
- I came to see this tree.
- Tree?

50
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,590
I have old ties with this tree.

51
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,920
A strange deep, emotional relationship.

52
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,550
- What?
- Whether you believe it or not...

53
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,440
to see this tree,
I have traveled for two days.

54
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,090
You're good with words.
What's your name?

55
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,100
- Ranjit.
- Where have you come from?

56
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,400
- Bombay.
- Bombay?

57
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,580
Then go back there
and trap some girl.

58
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,480
- Meaning?
- Your charm won't work here.

59
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,296
- Go your way!
- But listen to...

60
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,090
- I know everything. Leave! Out!
- Listen...

61
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,310
Out!

62
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,270
Crook!

63
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,820
Bahadur, Chandar, come here!

64
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,500
- What is it?
- Ramavatar said Ranjit has come here.

65
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,010
I always knew he'd return here.

66
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,900
He got off the bus and
went towards the colony.

67
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,040
You two follow him.
Don't let him out of your sight.

68
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,960
Don't worry, we'll handle it.

69
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,100
- Hello Mr. Dukhiya.
- Hello.

70
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,270
- Hello madam.
- Hello.

71
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,280
Two cups tea, puri bhaji,
and hot fritters.

72
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,090
The wrestler is with me.
Right?

73
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,200
- Right.
- Sit there.

74
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,790
- What would you like, sir?
- A cup of tea.

75
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,370
- My name is Bahadur Singh.
- And I'm his friend, Chandar.

76
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,360
We had important work with you.

77
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,300
Have tea. When I speak to you,
you won't take long is recognizing me.

78
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,500
Tell him, sir.
We're old friends.

79
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,810
- We are Robert's partners.
- Partners or murderers?

80
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,380
It's the same thing.
At least you recognized us.

81
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,230
If you don't return Robert's gold
to us, you'll meet the same fate, too.

82
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,250
What you can do, even I can do.

83
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,660
- What?
- You don't understand.

84
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,630
He means to say,
all thieves are brothers.

85
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,550
Come on, tell us,
even you'll get a share.

86
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,350
- Right, Bahadur?
- Of course. Why fight?

87
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,870
What fight, Mr. Coward?

88
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,430
- Shut up!
- Hey, Bahudur Singh!

89
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,390
You can't break the cup.

90
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,090
So what have you decided?
Where did you hide the gold?

91
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,790
I threw it in the river.

92
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,990
Good. The police must have arrived.
But you can't fool us.

93
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,670
You're right.

94
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,450
Mister, your name is Chandar,
and you laugh like a monkey.

95
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,590
- What did you say!
- You think you're so smart?

96
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,850
But we're one up on you.
You can't cheat us.

97
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,940
We have an eye on you.

98
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,580
Be careful, you may
go blind in that eye.

99
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,810
You bloody rogue!
Wonder where they come from?

100
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,060
- What happened, Hansa?
- He came to bother me early this morning.

101
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,910
Aunt, who was that man?

102
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,870
Don't know, he's new.

103
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,370
He was good.

104
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,290
Munnu, tell me, what story
did I tell you yesterday?

105
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,770
- Shall I say?
- You keep quiet.

106
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,480
The one I asked will tell.
Tell me, Munnu.

107
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,050
- Of King Harishchandra.
- Good. Sit down.

108
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,930
Gulab, what lesson do we learn
from King Harishchandra's story?

109
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,810
That however much sorrow we have,
we must not get scared.

110
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,550
- We must be brave.
- Good. Sit down.

111
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,710
So children, whatever problems
we are faced with...

112
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,980
we must not turn
away from the truth.

113
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,460
Brought the baby? Give me.

114
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,240
Come, my baby!

115
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,670
Go to sleep, child.

116
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,350
You're crying today,
you laugh tomorrow.

117
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,860
Your parents are making your future.

118
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,080
Don't cry. Maid,
take care of the baby.

119
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,260
You're still standing here?
Go to work. Go.

120
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,670
My baby is alone.
Will the baby have any problem?

121
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,390
Don't worry.
So many mothers like you...

122
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,650
leave their babies here in the morning
and go to work on the dam.

123
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,020
I take care of all of them. Your
baby won't have any problem here.

124
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,620
Go.

125
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,360
- Who is this Baba (man)?
- Laxmandasji, our savior.

126
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,520
He has made many
sacrifices for the country.

127
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,530
- Really?
- His leg broke from a police beating.

128
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,090
He takes care of the
laborers children now.

129
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,270
He really is a good man.

130
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,176
Bhola, why is there mud
on this stone?

131
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,880
- Sorry, sir.
- Get every stone cleaned and taken up.

132
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,410
Yes, sir.

133
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,810
- How's your hand?
- Better now.

134
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,650
Bhola, how many workers
are working on this side?

135
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,870
2000... sorry, 1000 this side,
and 1000 on the other.

136
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,780
- What about the mortar?
- The trolley is coming.

137
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,860
From tomorrow,
work will begin on slope 11.

138
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,470
Inform the contractor.

139
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,330
Sorry, sir.

140
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,050
What happened? Why're you shouting?
Can't you see I'm going to work?

141
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,180
I know you're going to work.
But baby, how can I not call you...

142
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,266
- when I see you?
- Oh, so that's the case?

143
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,740
Munia, last night I dreamt
I've got married.

144
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,850
Good! At least I escaped.

145
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,410
- Listen Munia.
- What is it?

146
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,480
- What's going on here?
- Nothing, sir.

147
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,270
Sir...

148
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,260
Munia, I know that Sukhan
is a loafer.

149
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,630
Gauri, if anyone troubles
you, tell me. I'll dismiss him!

150
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,660
You can dismiss him later.
I'll teach him a lesson before that.

151
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,450
You're right. Listen,
why don't you take some rest?

152
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,950
- Why?
- You're perspiring in the sun.

153
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,680
- Seeing you work hard, I feel bad.
- What do you mean?

154
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,190
If you understand, it's meaningful,
or it's meaningless.

155
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,020
Then consider it meaningless,
Supervisor.

156
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,680
What are you looking at?
You do your work.

157
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,210
- What is it?
- Wait!

158
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,430
- What is it?
- You're very lucky.

159
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,056
Why?

160
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,480
That's why everyone
shows you sympathy.

161
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,920
I don't want anyone's sympathy.

162
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,410
- Really?
- Talk about yourself.

163
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,310
That poor Sukhan dies over you.

164
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,800
If he is born,
he's going to die.

165
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
Let him die, I don't care.

166
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,280
What is it?
Why are you after me?

167
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,150
- How cruel you are!
- I'm like you.

168
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,500
- Who is he?
- How should I know?

169
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,800
Sorry, but who are you?

170
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,320
Sorry, but who are you?

171
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,300
You imitate me and ask
me who I am?

172
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,490
- I'm Bholanath.
- You are very naive.

173
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm the contractor's supervisor.

174
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,130
Without my permission,
nothing happens here.

175
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,390
- I can see that.
- What can you see?

176
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,650
A known face.

177
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,760
- Who? Gauri?
- What?

178
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,300
Sorry, but do you know her?

179
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,020
Yes, ours is an old relationship.

180
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,950
Oh God!

181
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,810
What is this? Blood! Sorry Munia,
but this happened because of you.

182
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,460
What? Because of me?

183
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,410
No Supervisor, it slipped from my
hand. Munia isn't to blame.

184
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,290
I got badly hurt.

185
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,450
Where did you get hurt?
Let me see.

186
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,220
What will you see?
I'll call the doctor.

187
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,370
Forget the doctor.
Get tincture of iodine for me.

188
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,110
You're too old to cry
over a minor injury.

189
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,990
Leave my foot!

190
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,400
Let me apply medicine.
Then I'll leave it.

191
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,490
Move aside!

192
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,310
Sir, being the supervisor,
you will touch her foot?

193
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,130
Give, I'll apply it.

194
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,180
- Gauri, does it hurt too much?
- She'll be fine, you leave.

195
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,400
- Why should I?
- If you waste time here...

196
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,160
the company will lose money.

197
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,306
Who are you to tell me that?
I know my job.

198
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,826
I know very well, Supervisor.

199
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,060
What are you all doing here?
Get back to work!

200
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,900
Yes.

201
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,220
- Is it okay now?
- What okay?

202
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,230
- It all happened because of you.
- Because of me?

203
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,920
Of course. Why did you tell the
supervisor ours is an old relationship?

204
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,560
Why? Didn't we meet this morning?

205
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,600
Meeting in the morning
makes our relationship old?

206
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,420
That happens sometimes, Gauri.

207
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,100
Crook!

208
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,710
Gauri, come here.

209
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,560
Now I know, Gauri.
You're very secretive

210
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,630
- What?
- Now don't pretend.

211
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,730
I'm a girl, and so are you.
I know when a girl says no.

212
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,510
- I only met him today.
- After how many days?

213
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,050
- For the first time today.
- Don't hide from me.

214
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,300
- I understand very well.
- Go! I won't talk to you.

215
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,310
Yes, why talk to me?
Go talk to him.

216
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:18,900
Why do you worry?
I'm there to talk to you.

217
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,060
Coming.

218
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,850
- Gauri, what happened to your foot?
- Nothing, the pan fell on my foot.

219
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,720
- Are you badly hurt?
- No, it's a small graze.

220
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,510
- Who bandaged your foot?
- He did.

221
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,520
Okay, there's no need to worry.
Go and work.

222
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,660
- You dressed her wound?
- Yes.

223
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,360
You're a good boy.
You help people when in trouble.

224
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,910
- I've never seen you here before.
- I arrived only today.

225
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,160
- My name is Ranjit.
- Okay. Come.

226
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,830
So many people are working
under the scorching sun.

227
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,970
They're toiling day and night.

228
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,130
It really is hard work.
That's what I'm saying.

229
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,150
These thousands, millions
of people working here...

230
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,240
do so not just to make wages,
but so they can fight drought.

231
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,300
So that they can stop floods.

232
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,580
These dams will bring
us joys in the future.

233
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,780
The dam is our guard,
our protector, our God.

234
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,410
- Does it hurt too much?
- No, the bandage has come loose.

235
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,856
Then get it tightened
by the one who tied it for you.

236
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,530
- Munia! Mind your tongue.
- Okay!

237
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,810
Hey! Speak of the devil!

238
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,310
Who?

239
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,190
The one you belong to,
who belongs to you.

240
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,230
Not me, now call him.

241
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,120
- How many days have you worked here?
- Many days now. Actually...

242
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,890
Sir, I'm leaving,
my babe has come.

243
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,620
Bye!

244
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,090
- What is it?
- Where?

245
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,580
I'm asking you.
Why are you following me?

246
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,150
- I was going to your house.
- What for?

247
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,550
- To ask how your foot is.
- It's fine now.

248
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,780
It'll be fine in 2-3 days.

249
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,930
- Now what?
- Is your father home?

250
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,620
I don't know.

251
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,120
- Your father is very nice. I mean...
- I very well know what you mean.

252
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,050
- But I'm not a loose character.
- What are you saying!

253
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,140
Just because you bandaged my foot,
you're after me now.

254
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,120
- Keep your bandage!
- Why did you open the bandage?

255
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,110
- You're back, Gauri.
- Yes.

256
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,950
- I've put the tea pot on the fire.
- I'll make tea.

257
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,000
Hello, Baba.

258
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,780
Come, son. You've come at the
right time. Gauri, bring two cups.

259
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,530
Okay.

260
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,110
- Gulab, mangoes.
- Take them.

261
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,740
- Kid!
- Coming, sister.

262
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,190
Come inside, son.

263
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,746
Where all did you go?

264
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,670
Nowhere. I just roamed the bazaar
and came here.

265
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,610
You must have found
this jungle strange.

266
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,380
It is, but a new world
is coming up.

267
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,070
It really is. And when it's ready,
even our times will change.

268
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,180
- Will you eat mango, sister?
- Who gave you?

269
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,640
- He did.
- Crook!

270
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,590
What did I do?

271
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,286
Eat.

272
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,390
You participated in the
freedom struggle, didn't you?

273
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,700
Yes, I forget my family and
jumped in the freedom movement.

274
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,760
At that time, Gandhiji's call
was echoing all over India.

275
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,180
Who could have sat at home?

276
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,370
- Then what happened?
- Your head.

277
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,420
- What?
- Eat your mango.

278
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,430
- What would happen? I went to jail.
- Jail?

279
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,030
Yes. I spent 12 years in jail.

280
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,240
- 12 years!
- People were hanged, sentenced to life.

281
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,920
12 years is nothing.

282
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,960
But despite having such feelings
of sacrifice, we have a big weakness.

283
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,170
- What?
- You wouldn't understand.

284
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,880
What?

285
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,480
Nothing! Where are the tea leaves?

286
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,010
We got freedom.

287
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,190
But our internal fights
made us slaves again.

288
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,800
Think something, try to understand!

289
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:04,170
Why fight over difference in
religion, status, caste?

290
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,070
This country is ours,
we belong to this country.

291
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,920
- We must live united.
- You're right.

292
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,760
It is time to rise now.
To make a new India.

293
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,390
Do something that will benefit
everyone, make everyone progress.

294
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:26,120
So that our children grow up
and proudly tell the world...

295
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,190
they are Indians!

296
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,820
- Father, tea.
- How long have you been standing here?

297
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,880
I was lost in thought.

298
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,830
That's nothing new. But why
tell a man who won't understand?

299
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,050
What! You say anything
that comes to your mind.

300
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,660
- Baba, I'm leaving.
- Have tea before you go.

301
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,460
- Not now.
- What? You won't drink?

302
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,140
Do our milk and tea leaves
come for free?

303
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,280
Why would he drink?
You say such insulting things.

304
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,170
- Apologize to him!
- I'm sorry.

305
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,440
- At least have it now.
- Have it, son.

306
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,880
Son, don't mind her words.
I was in jail for 12 years.

307
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,320
There was no one to take care of her.
She was left uneducated.

308
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,940
She acts like that,
but she has a good heart.

309
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,130
Yes. You really recognized her.

310
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,660
- Why are you smiling to yourself?
- Who says I'm smiling? Go and study.

311
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,820
Son, do one thing. Find a
job here and get to work.

312
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,230
When two people get together,
they become friends.

313
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,870
When they become five,
they form a committee.

314
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,500
When there are more,
they become a society...

315
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,270
a village, make a country.

316
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,970
- Drop after drop makes the sea.
- Your talks are very interesting.

317
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,640
Oh, come on! I say
whatever comes to my mind.

318
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,260
- I'll be going.
- Bless you.

319
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,880
Gauri, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry for any mistakes.

320
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,620
And if you don't like
my talking to your father...

321
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,470
That's between you and father.
Who am I to interfere?

322
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,280
Next time you make tea,
don't forget to add sugar.

323
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,950
What! There was
no sugar in the tea?

324
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,990
Better!

325
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,180
Why are you smiling again, sister?

326
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,770
Not your business.
Go and study! Go!

327
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,830
Hey! Listen.

328
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,440
- The tea was sugarless?
- Yes.

329
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,970
Take, have jaggery instead.

330
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,310
But Gauri, we have jaggery only
when marriages are fixed.

331
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,010
Naughty!

332
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,800
With the meeting of our eyes

333
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,570
We fell in love

334
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,880
You are surprised, and so am I

335
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,330
I tried hiding,
I tried escaping it

336
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,800
But what to do when
my heart is out of control?

337
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,960
Now the whole world knows,
family and even strangers know

338
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,930
The world will taunt, why fear?

339
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:30,320
Whether you know or not,
whether you believe or not

340
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,909
I have never loved
anyone other than you

341
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:39,989
If I had not met you,
how would my eyes glitter?

342
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,950
You are the cure to
my heartache, my love

343
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,170
Youth is short-lived,
like flowing river water

344
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,450
Sacrifice your heart for love

345
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,710
Don't suppress your feelings,
you also lose something

346
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,630
For the garland of
fair arms around you

347
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,860
- You dance really well, Hansabai.
- Leave my hand!

348
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,260
Hansabai, I want to marry you.

349
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Move aside!

350
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,270
Hey, Bahadur Singh! Leave her hand!
Force won't be tolerated here.

351
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,090
It may be force for you,
it is love for me.

352
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,830
Right you are, friend.

353
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,840
I said leave my hand! Leave!

354
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,340
- You rascal! Leave me!
- I won't.

355
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,580
- Hey! Leave her.
- I won't.

356
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,860
I said let her go.

357
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,430
- You rascal!
- Ranjit! I'll deal with you.

358
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,400
- Shall I come now?
- You won't dare!

359
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,590
Let's go.
We'll deal with him tomorrow.

360
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,530
Tomorrow?
I'll deal with you tomorrow.

361
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,250
You saved my hotel's prestige.
Where do you live?

362
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,580
I'm looking for a place.

363
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,820
Then stay here.
Lodging, boarding, Rs.2 per day.

364
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,260
Suits me.

365
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,040
Hansa, show him the room.

366
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,450
Come.

367
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:29,000
- No one ever took us to a room.
- We aren't that lucky.

368
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,910
Let's go.

369
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,780
Come.

370
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,110
Sit.

371
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,440
I'll change my clothes.

372
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,510
What's your name?

373
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,950
- From where?
- Bombay.

374
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,700
Bombay? Why have you come so far?

375
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,010
Why do you want to know
so much about me?

376
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,510
You saved me from disgrace.
Won't I want to know you?

377
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,190
I've come looking for work.

378
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,300
- What is your name?
- Hansa.

379
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,100
Or Rini?

380
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,200
I was Rini, I'm Hansa now.

381
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,530
Time changes man.

382
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,450
Now I sing and dance.
I'm free, absolutely free.

383
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,750
The knot is so tight,
it doesn't open.

384
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,740
Please open it.

385
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,530
Thank you.

386
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,570
- Liked my song and dance?
- It was good.

387
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,140
- Only good?
- Very good.

388
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,780
The moment I saw you, I felt
you were someone dear to me.

389
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,350
Someone known,
someone close to the heart.

390
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,790
- What happened? Sit down.
- Is this my room?

391
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,440
It's mine, but you
can treat it as your own.

392
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,150
Show me my room.

393
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,990
Come.

394
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,020
- Is this my room?
- Yes.

395
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,490
The idiot has come!
He's always bothering me.

396
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,850
Coming.

397
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,440
What coming? Just come.

398
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,840
- Go, he must be wanting something.
- Know what he wants?

399
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,290
I know.

400
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,540
Sorry, but why has
this man come here?

401
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,420
To meet me.

402
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,220
- He's an old acquaintance.
- He's your acquaintance too?

403
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,860
Yes.

404
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,440
He needs a job.
Fix him up somewhere.

405
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:40,080
- I would, but there's no opening.
- Then create one.

406
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,150
I put the responsibility on you.

407
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,670
You have to give him work.
Got it?

408
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:56,690
Yes, I get it. But why are
you so concerned about him?

409
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:02,330
Asking and telling spoils the
fun of a certain thing, Mr. Bhola.

410
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,330
Okay, I understand.

411
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,460
Your wish is my command.
I'll give him a job.

412
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:18,400
You really are a naive man,
Mr. Bhola. An interesting man.

413
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,800
- Your man has come.
- Who?

414
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,390
Your acquaintance who is a stranger.

415
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,280
Oh my! See how sweetly
he looks at you?

416
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:04,086
Shameless! Brazen!
Ask him to leave.

417
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,980
He's your acquaintance
Why should I tell him?

418
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,960
- Don't tell him! Go die!
- Why should I die?

419
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,680
May my enemies die.

420
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,110
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking.

421
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,310
- What?
- What is to be looked at?

422
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,030
You look at me, people look at you.

423
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,900
Just think what people will say.
What will they think?

424
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,670
Forget about them.
You tell me what you think.

425
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,300
Me? I think you're a crook.

426
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,970
- Really? Then the crook is leaving.
- Leave! I don't care.

427
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,410
You don't do any work,
you just roam around all day.

428
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,690
- Wastrel!
- I should get a job.

429
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,580
One who wants to work finds a job.

430
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,880
Sorry, but why do you keep
making the rounds of this place?

431
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,590
I've come to see you.
Have a cigarette.

432
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,400
I don't want your cigarette!
Go away!

433
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:22,330
As you wish. If you're asking
me to leave, I'm going.

434
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,990
Indeed! He makes
the rounds to flirt.

435
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,280
And then he imitates me.

436
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,730
How long will you
roam around like hat?

437
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,370
I'm not roaming, I'm misleading.
People like you.

438
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,040
- Big deal!
- Is that so?

439
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,430
I'll finish my job today
and leave tomorrow. Get that?

440
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,940
We'll deal with you tomorrow then.

441
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,860
There's no one here right now.
Now's the time to escape with the gold.

442
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,100
Hardworking man rose!
The destiny of earth shined

443
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,660
Great!

444
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:12,910
That dust we touch turns to gold

445
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,040
- Hard work...
- Is what it's all about

446
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,826
- Hard work...
- Is the real support

447
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,470
- Hard work...
- Is our slogan!

448
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,680
The generous nature
will give everything

449
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:49,970
All mountains on the way will
crumble, just sweat it out

450
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,770
The fool lying under the
tree shouts for mangoes

451
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,230
But one who climbs
the branch gets the mangoes

452
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,680
What will anyone give, how long
will he give? Why should we beg?

453
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:07,180
Why not build our dreams
with this dust?

454
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,230
- Hello.
- Hello. Tell me.

455
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,670
- I want a job.
- There is no job.

456
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,780
I'm educated, a mechanic,
and I can even operate a crane.

457
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,040
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.

458
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,570
Thousands of people are working here.
Can't I get a job too?

459
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,760
I'm really sorry.
Find work elsewhere.

460
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,840
Listen. Got a job?

461
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:23,900
You won't get a job asking him.
He'll give you a job.

462
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:32,400
Gauri, look. Your acquaintance
knows others too.

463
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,140
Mr. Bhola, give him a job.

464
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,010
Now that you insist,
I'll have to give him a job.

465
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,730
But he's an educated, fashionable
man. He won't work as a laborer.

466
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,100
Don't tease me, Supervisor.
I'll do anything you say.

467
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,700
You can give me the job
of carrying stones.

468
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,130
Sure.

469
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:01,510
Ramavtar, from tomorrow, 250
laborers will work on block 11.

470
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,740
- Note his work too.
- Not work, name. Ranjit.

471
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:06,900
So you will teach me now?

472
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,450
- Happy now?
- Thank you, Supervisor.

473
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,580
I'm talking to Hansa,
and you are answering me?

474
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,650
Sorry. I'll come to work
tomorrow morning. Bye!

475
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,010
Baba! I got a job.
Of carrying stones.

476
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:32,220
Really? That's great.
Stones are the real foundation.

477
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,310
Come, son.

478
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,040
Where are you going, Gulab?

479
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,870
To Mangal's house
to play hide and seek.

480
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,610
So you are going to play.
Where is your father?

481
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,350
He's gone to meet someone.
He'll return late.

482
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:56,540
- And where's your sister?
- She's cooking in the kitchen.

483
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,080
You go and play.

484
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,010
I've come to give you good news.

485
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,940
I've got a job.
Rs.75 a month.

486
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,610
But I still haven't
found a place to stay.

487
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:33,230
I thought I'd tell Baba.
But it doesn't seem right.

488
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,190
Shall I pour?

489
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,550
Put more?

490
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:50,040
- Hey! You made it watery!
- At least you spoke.

491
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,930
As if you care for my words.
Go talk to that dancer.

492
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,830
- You're referring to Hansa?
- Hansa or Hansi, I don't care.

493
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,030
You're very angry.
Why don't you understand?

494
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,830
- I understand everything.
- You don't understand anything.

495
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,040
What don't I understand? Weren't you
laughing and chatting with her?

496
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,660
- Only for selfish reasons.
- I know you're a very selfish man.

497
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,160
You don't know anything at all.
Come with me!

498
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,170
- What are you doing?
- Come!

499
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:19,070
Let go!

500
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,490
Gauri, I told you the first day...

501
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:27,440
I have an old, very deep
bond with this tree.

502
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,470
Know why?
There's gold hidden in here.

503
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,150
- Gold?
- Yes. Gold worth Rs. 150000.

504
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,080
- What?
- Gauri, I'm not as bad as you think.

505
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,390
Though for a moment, I did slip.

506
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:52,540
I never expected I'd have
to fly like a straw in a storm one day.

507
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,040
What do you mean?
I don't understand anything.

508
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,350
Then listen, Gauri. I don't want
to hide anything from you.

509
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:07,650
Five years ago, I used to
operate cranes on the Bombay docks.

510
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,340
Ships used to come and go.

511
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,260
My job was to load
and unload goods...

512
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,150
from morning to night,
with the help of a machine.

513
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,930
Even life was moving like a machine.

514
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:30,420
I was alone in the world.
I had no parents or siblings.

515
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,650
I just had a friend named Robert.

516
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,910
Robert used to travel on the ship.

517
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:46,110
When he came ashore,
we used to meet like brothers.

518
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,256
- You've returned after many days.
- Yes, I went to Aden.

519
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,880
I was there for a month.

520
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,030
There was a girl in
my lonely life, Sudha.

521
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,980
I loved her a lot,
but perhaps destiny did not agree.

522
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,890
One day, when I went to meet her...

523
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,750
Your marriage has been arranged?

524
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,040
- What are you saying!
- The truth.

525
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:31,160
Right. I'm an ordinary crane
driver, you're a rich girl.

526
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,500
We're no match.

527
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,990
Don't say that. I won't
care for anything to get you.

528
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,850
- When is the marriage?
- Day after tomorrow.

529
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,160
- Day after tomorrow?
- Take me far away from here.

530
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,346
Or else...

531
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:50,500
But I don't have any money
to take you away from here.

532
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,050
- I have jewelry.
- No Sudha, I can't do that.

533
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,230
But don't worry,
I'll arrange the money.

534
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,950
I kept wondering where to get the money.
I thought of Robert.

535
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,490
- Robert, I need money.
- What for?

536
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,080
Don't ask me that.

537
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,690
Just know that if I don't get
the money, my life will be ruined.

538
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:23,490
I understand!
It's a matter of love.

539
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,030
I'll give you money,
but you must do a job for me.

540
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,250
What job?

541
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,260
You know brother,
even I love someone.

542
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,080
- Who?
- Rini. She's a fairy!

543
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,760
- Really?
- Yes.

544
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,546
She came here from Goa, and then
left for her home in Hyderabad.

545
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,540
She left her bag here.
Will you take it to her?

546
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,750
- Sure.
- You help me, I'll help you.

547
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,160
When I was leaving with the bag,
I suddenly heard...

548
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,160
- Where's the gold?
- You won't get the gold.

549
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,270
Robert, tell me where the gold is!

550
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,000
And the whole truth was revealed.
But I couldn't save Robert.

551
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:01,490
I thought I'd inform the police,
but the greed for gold is bad.

552
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,970
I took the bag and ran,
and kept running.

553
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:37,600
But the arm of the law is long.

554
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,190
I was arrested,
and was sentenced to five years.

555
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,700
And after serving the sentence
and came here.

556
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:52,650
If you had given the gold to the police,
you wouldn't have been jailed.

557
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,980
The promise given to
my friend made me helpless.

558
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,210
Nothing else?

559
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:05,640
There was a little bit of greed
too, for my own comfort.

560
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,460
And now?

561
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,830
Have you seen a
river in spate, Gauri?

562
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:15,680
Spate? Yes, so?

563
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:21,340
A home that takes years
of hard work to build...

564
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,240
is destroyed in minutes in a spate.

565
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,970
- You know that?
- Yes.

566
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,690
A spate came in my life too...

567
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,330
and carried away the greed
for gold with it.

568
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:42,130
But Sudha's story isn't over.

569
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,460
When I was released,
I learned she was married.

570
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,320
That story came to an end.

571
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,810
- And now?
- Now I love someone else.

572
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,680
Because man cannot live
without loving someone.

573
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:02,730
- Who do you love now?
- Shall I say it?

574
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,600
No.

575
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:22,970
Listen.

576
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,060
Listen.

577
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,680
I like you very much, Gauri.

578
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,120
Playing along, things just happened

579
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,680
I tried hard to stop, but...

580
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,590
playing along, things just happened

581
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,230
He told me...

582
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:36,830
since our eyes met,
he cannot sleep

583
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:44,390
Counting the stars, I swear,
the night just doesn't pass

584
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,050
I stared at him and expressed shock

585
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,180
He's been after me
since our very first meeting

586
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:33,960
I gave him a finger,
he took my hand

587
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:43,250
My heart started pounding

588
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:47,310
He said something in my ear,
and my heart skipped a beat

589
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,560
But I kept it in check

590
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,030
I pulled back my hands and said

591
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:01,140
If you don't leave now,
you'll go to jail

592
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,930
Then the good man...

593
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,600
begged at my feet

594
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,900
And I felt pity on him

595
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,900
I thought, why not let the
clouds of love burst?

596
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:56,390
He came, I fell silent,
he fell silent

597
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,860
- You?
- I thought we better decide today.

598
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:15,300
- Decide about what?
- The gold.

599
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,520
You have escaped enough.
We won't spare you today.

600
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:25,180
Tell me where the gold is,
or I'll kill you!

601
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,140
Blood has always been shed
to get gold that's ill-gotten.

602
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,520
Shut up!

603
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,540
- What's going on?
- You?

604
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,960
Leave him!

605
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,250
- You bully a decent man?
- But...

606
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,910
Don't you feel ashamed? Go away!

607
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,660
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Go!

608
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,700
Thanks for the favor.

609
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,540
Listen!

610
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:22,360
- What's your name?
- Ranjit.

611
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,090
- You seem new here.
- Yes.

612
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,630
My name is Mohan Singh.
I'm the contractor here.

613
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,950
- What work do you do here?
- I carry stones.

614
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,430
- Carry stones?
- Yes.

615
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:38,680
But you look educated and sensible.

616
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:44,220
If you want to quit carrying stones
and want a promotion, come to me.

617
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,460
I treat no job as mean.
Thank you anyway.

618
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:59,550
- You?
- Your charm drew me here.

619
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:06,350
A big contractor like you coming
to a girl like me is not ordinary.

620
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,440
I'm a businessman, Hansa.

621
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:13,920
What something is worth,
I know very well.

622
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:22,110
You are very beautiful. I wonder
why I didn't notice you before.

623
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:31,599
Anyway, forget the personal talk.
Let's get to work.

624
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,560
- Work?
- Your name is Rini?

625
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,750
- Who told you?
- You loved Robert?

626
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:47,326
You...?

627
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:50,100
Before dying, Robert gave
gold for you to a man.

628
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:55,800
- For me?
- Yes. Gold worth Rs. 150000.

629
01:08:57,029 --> 01:08:59,309
Rs. 150000? Rubbish!

630
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:06,759
- It's the truth.
- Truth? Then where is that man?

631
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,060
- Where is that gold?
- Wait.

632
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,710
If I hadn't told you this,
would you come to know?

633
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:23,210
And if I don't tell you
anything more, will you know?

634
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,680
To learn about it, you'll
have to agree to one condition.

635
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:36,040
Condition? Everyone has
a condition here.

636
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,200
- Whose conditions do I fulfill?
- I'm only talking about business.

637
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,950
But that gold is mine.

638
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:54,970
The gold is yours,
but the business is mine.

639
01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:01,390
Think it over. You will make
35-40 thousand rupees just like that.

640
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,730
- I agree.
- Good.

641
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,190
That means, you will work for me,
and I will work for you.

642
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,540
- Who has the gold?
- Ranjit.

643
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,710
Why shout? You crashed
into the wrong person.

644
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,850
- I didn't see you, Munia. Sorry.
- Why will you see me now?

645
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,190
See him. Crash into him.

646
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,230
- Naughty!
- Who, me?

647
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,950
Then who else? Me?

648
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,790
Gauri, you're very naive.

649
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:10,750
When a young girl turns
and looks at a young guy...

650
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:15,550
and feels shy, smiles,
and crashes into others...

651
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,750
know that she's gone for a toss.

652
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:23,370
- Don't tease me.
- You call the truth teasing?

653
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,730
Hey, better work,
or your wage will get deducted.

654
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,970
She doesn't care.

655
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:40,046
You have such big eyes,
can't you see?

656
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:43,716
I can see,
but nothing except you.

657
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,850
- Shut up!
- Why get angry?

658
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,740
- I'll fill it for you.
- Don't bother.

659
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,580
This attitude of yours
makes me call you babe.

660
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,290
Coming!

661
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,670
What is it?

662
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:02,540
Munia, did you bang
into the right man?

663
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,880
Gauri, beware!

664
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,990
You bang into him,
and get angry at me.

665
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,160
- Great!
- Don't tease me, Gauri!

666
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:17,610
You call the truth teasing?
Really, it'll be a great pair.

667
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:22,230
- You and him, right?
- No, you and him.

668
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,310
Naughty!

669
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:33,220
Why do you bang
into Munia every time?

670
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:36,140
I don't do it deliberately.

671
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,510
If your eye sight is bad,
buy glasses.

672
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,500
What's the need for glasses?

673
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,630
Those who want to see,
can even close their eyes and see.

674
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:50,930
Supervisor, I've fallen
in love with Munia.

675
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,620
Quiet! If you fall in love with
any girl, I'll dismiss you! Get that?

676
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,840
Dismiss me, indeed!
Who is he to dismiss me?

677
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:07,220
Even if you dismiss me from the
world, I won't leave my Munia.

678
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:22,460
I know why your bangles clink

679
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:32,570
Even I know who secretly
came to your house

680
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:55,870
Under the shade of the tree,
talking romantic

681
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,970
He stole my naive heart

682
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:15,660
I know why your earring is shaking

683
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:01,440
Twisting my arm,
encircling me in his arms

684
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:16,500
He captured my heart

685
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:21,050
I know where your bindiya fell

686
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:04,070
Don't tell anyone and I won't either

687
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:11,690
Okay, you belong to your beau,
I'll belong to mine

688
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:22,820
What can one do
when the feet's...

689
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:31,240
What can one do when
the feet's anklets tinkle

690
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,370
There's no need to worry.
You're fine now, Mr. Mathur.

691
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:01,500
- I'll take your leave.
- Okay.

692
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,040
Bhola, where's the man
who saved me?

693
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:10,250
- He's siting outside.
- Who is he? Call him inside.

694
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,680
Yes, sir. Sorry.

695
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,820
Come inside, sir has called you.

696
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:35,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

697
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,500
Come in, why are
you standing there?

698
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:44,890
Seema, he's the
man who saved my life.

699
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:47,410
- She's my wife.
- Hello.

700
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,720
I'll never forget this
favor of yours for life.

701
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,840
Don't say that and embarrass me.

702
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:59,880
It's our duty to
serve our employers.

703
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,740
Sorry.

704
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:06,010
- Madam, I gave him the job.
- What do you do?

705
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,870
- I carry stones.
- Stones? But you are educated.

706
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,510
I've completed my matriculation.
I'm also a mechanic.

707
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,016
I used to operate a crane earlier.

708
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,500
Oh. I'm sorry that despite being
so capable, you work as a laborer.

709
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,520
I know no one can repay a favor.

710
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:30,500
But yet, I'll do everything I
can for your good.

711
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:34,480
Bholanath, he'll drive the
crane from tomorrow.

712
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:40,890
Sure sir, how can I forget? I knew
he was capable, he will progress.

713
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:43,891
I'll go to the office right now
and make the arrangements.

714
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:47,670
- Hello, Mr. Mohan.
- May I come in? Hello Mrs. Mathur.

715
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,720
- Hello Mr. Mathur. How are you?
- I'm fine now.

716
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:54,970
Thank God for that. I really
was scared. I came running here.

717
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:59,536
- You simply took the trouble.
- Come on, sir. It's no bother.

718
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,970
This is a jungle,
and then, we are away from home.

719
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:07,840
The rule here is that you
help me, and I help you.

720
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,380
You're right. If it wasn't
for him, I'd be dead today.

721
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:17,310
- Oh, so you're here. Great!
- I'll send tea for you.

722
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:22,930
- Okay sir, I'll leave.
- Have some tea first.

723
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,820
No sir, thank you.
I'll leave.

724
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:29,970
Okay, but drive
the crane from tomorrow.

725
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,820
Yes, sir.

726
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,660
- You gave him a promotion?
- Yes.

727
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,240
- But...
- But what?

728
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:48,100
You don't know he used
to drive cranes on the Bombay docks.

729
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:51,440
Heserved a sentence
of five years for smuggling.

730
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:59,490
- How do you know?
- I had an export-import business there.

731
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,080
I used to go to the docks
for that sometimes.

732
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:08,330
But there's no law that states a
man not be given a chance to reform.

733
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:11,650
Of course. You're right.

734
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,220
We want a party today!

735
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,870
Oh cream!

736
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:02,120
See what gestures the spring,
the sights are making

737
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:09,560
Belong to someone,
time favors you

738
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:43,420
My eyes have yearned
to tell you something for so long

739
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:56,390
Look into my eyes.
Time favors you

740
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:33,070
I tried convincing my heart,
but it did not relent

741
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:45,850
Convince my heart.
Time favors you

742
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:19,070
This pain is strange
I can't find the cure

743
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:32,030
You cure the pain.
Time favors you

744
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,530
Open the door, Gauri.

745
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,240
Why have you come here?

746
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,590
Don't you feel ashamed?
I'm not like Hansa!

747
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,120
- You misunderstand me.
- I understand you very well.

748
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:11,960
At least don't fight with me today.
I got a promotion today.

749
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,866
It's a day to celebrate.

750
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:18,500
Then go and celebrate. Sing and
dance with your hand round her waist.

751
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,780
- Drink liquor!
- You think I drank liquor?

752
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,460
Smell me.

753
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,040
I'm not a drunkard, Gauri.

754
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:09,260
Everyone is celebrating for you,
and you're sitting here?

755
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:16,770
- I'm not destined for happiness.
- Why? Because she didn't relent?

756
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:22,380
- Why do you want to know?
- Okay. But why do you get angry?

757
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,580
Shall I tell you something?

758
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,480
You aren't happy here, nor am I.

759
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:36,390
Let's run away from here.

760
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,380
It's not my job to run away
with a girl like you.

761
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,380
I know.
I'm a very bad girl.

762
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,410
But who brought me to this state?

763
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:54,730
If you had returned
Robert's gold to me...

764
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:57,700
- I don't have any gold.
- That means you won't give me gold.

765
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,810
What I don't have,
why argue about it?

766
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:03,870
Shut up! I know you
took that gold.

767
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:08,470
But remember, I won't spare you
like that. I'll take revenge.

768
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:10,930
I won't let you live in peace!

769
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:27,020
Sukhalal, teach him all the work
in connection with the crane.

770
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,490
Okay, Supervisor.
Come, Ranjit.

771
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,610
Pull me up.

772
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:43,860
I'll show you.
This is the button. Press it.

773
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:45,950
That's the lever, pull it.

774
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:51,270
- And this is the starter.
- You already know it.

775
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:55,940
- This is what I did in Bombay.
- Then I don't need to explain it to you.

776
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,970
You do your work, I'm going.

777
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:00,810
Sukhan, help me down.

778
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,820
Thank you.

779
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:15,046
You are great! Now you look
down at the world from there...

780
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:16,710
and we'll work down.

781
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:21,590
What's the point? You are happier.
Your heart is happier.

782
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:27,020
- What happened to your heart?
- A slap in the face, and a hurt heart.

783
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:31,410
- Had a fight with Gauri?
- I gave you all a treat yesterday.

784
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:34,470
- She even thought I drank.
- Oh damn!

785
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:37,806
Sukhan, only you can bring
about a compromise.

786
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,230
And how is that?

787
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:45,620
You don't have to say that.
I can do it in a jiffy!

788
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:46,960
Then go quickly.

789
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,090
Go fast!

790
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,550
What happened? Why are
you shouting like crazy?

791
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:01,490
Consider me crazy.
Come here.

792
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:06,550
- Send Gauri alone for awhile.
- What!

793
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,520
Yes, I have some
important work with her

794
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,036
If I cannot talk to her,
I'll die.

795
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:13,980
- What rubbish are you talking?
- It's the truth.

796
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,010
- Why don't you understand?
- I understand.

797
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:20,920
I didn't know you were so bad.
You eye my friend?

798
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:23,830
If Ranjit hears you,
he'll kill you!

799
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:27,750
I'm doing it for him. Listen.

800
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,486
If that's the case,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

801
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:35,906
I was, but you don't listen.

802
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:39,490
Okay, you don't have to yak.
I have understood now.

803
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:40,990
Send her soon.

804
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,250
- What is it?
- Come here.

805
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,840
What happened? What's the matter?

806
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,640
You look very sad today.

807
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:02,110
- Of course not.
- Have you fought with him?

808
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:04,870
- With whom?
- With Ranjit, who else?

809
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:08,840
I'm not concerned with anyone.
Don't talk like that with me.

810
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,100
You don't care for love?
And work is so important?

811
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:16,070
Good you're rid of love.
Come with me.

812
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,820
- Where?
- Just come.

813
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:45,920
- Where have you brought me?
- Just come.

814
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,320
- Munia, where are you going?
- Gauri, come here.

815
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:01,130
- Why? I'm getting late to work.
- Forget work, come here.

816
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,070
- What happened?
- Look...

817
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,720
flowers have been offered at the crane.

818
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,776
What's that to me??

819
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,730
Shall I put one
flower in your hair?

820
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:17,756
- But that's been offered for worship.
- So what?

821
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:20,270
You'll put it in your hair,
not throw it away.

822
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,690
You wear one for me,
I'll wear one for you.

823
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:25,730
I don't want it.
I'll wear it for you.

824
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:35,390
Oh my!

825
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:59,440
O people, see this unique
sight of the 20th century

826
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:11,260
The moon of earth has set out
to touch the moon of the sky

827
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:16,140
This moon is not of Russia,
not of Japan

828
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:21,060
Neither is it of America,
this moon is Indian!

829
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:03,530
You have covered your
fair face with a scarf

830
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:14,530
Even the sighted yearned for
the sight. I'm lucky to see it

831
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:56,040
Enemies see and feel jealous,
friends praise it

832
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:07,150
Let's see who you favor,
who becomes your groom

833
01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:00,580
It roams from beauty to love

834
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,900
Your one smile is evening,
and another is the dawn

835
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:16,270
- You simply ran so much.
- Leave me.

836
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:22,820
You can leave my hand and go,
but how will you leave my heart?

837
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,440
- Don't talk too much, or else...
- Or else what?

838
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:29,440
You beat me yesterday.
What's the matter after all?

839
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,820
You still don't understand me?

840
01:39:31,970 --> 01:39:34,180
You ask me?
Why not ask yourself?

841
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,170
- But what have I done?
- How naive you are.

842
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:41,820
You got me on the crane
and showed me to the world.

843
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:43,640
You teased me, defamed me.

844
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,550
Getting you on the
crane defamed you?

845
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:52,200
And when you marry me,
what will happen then?

846
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:01,440
Enough of being angry, Gauri.
Talk romantic sometimes.

847
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,030
Romantic indeed! Don't you
dare talk to that Hansa!

848
01:40:07,490 --> 01:40:09,390
Talking won't make me
fall in love with her.

849
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:15,220
That fair girl decks herself
up and tries to charm you.

850
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:19,830
Whereas I'm an illiterate,
village girl, a laborer.

851
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,370
You can't compare a well
to the holy Ganga.

852
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:36,460
I don't know how I raised
my hand on you yesterday.

853
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:41,580
- I'm sorry.
- It was my fault.

854
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:44,200
Of course.
You always make me angry.

855
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:59,410
Gauri, the day after tomorrow
is August 15th, our independence day.

856
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,020
A minister will come here.
There'll be celebrations.

857
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:06,630
I know. Madhav is making
arrangements for song and dance.

858
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:09,870
- Munia will also dance.
- Won't you?

859
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,110
No. I don't know how to dance.

860
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:40,100
See how lovely the lights look.

861
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:43,320
Like flowers have bloomed.

862
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:51,610
Know how this place will look
after the dam is completed?

863
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:53,160
- How?
- You don't know?

864
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:55,990
Come, I'll show you.

865
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:02,480
Mr. Ramaya, switch on
the machine and show us...

866
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:04,370
how the water will flow.

867
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:17,470
If it rains heavily,
it will stop the water flow.

868
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:19,960
And the dam doors will be opened
when we need water.

869
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:23,380
The water will go straight from
the dam to the fields.

870
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,730
Even far away fields
will get water.

871
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:33,350
A new world will be created here.

872
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,920
Then I'll buy some land
in this new world.

873
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:41,860
- Why?
- I'll do farming, make a small house.

874
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:49,670
- Then?
- My dream will come true.

875
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:22,270
- Come.
- What are you doing!

876
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:24,620
- People will see.
- Who will see?

877
01:43:26,350 --> 01:43:27,850
What food have you brought?

878
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:13,280
Hey baby, come here!

879
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:19,790
- Come.
- Hey! the kids are here.

880
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:26,520
- Where are you lost?
- Nowhere.

881
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:30,130
I was seeing a lovely dream.

882
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:35,430
- Where do dreams come true?
- Our dream surely will.

883
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:39,730
- Don't see dreams.
- What do I do?

884
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:42,610
I've learned that after finding you.

885
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,920
If I hadn't met you,
I would be what I was.

886
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:51,070
You have awakened a man's
sleeping heart.

887
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,520
What are you saying?
I didn't understand a thing.

888
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:00,660
Oh God! It's very late.

889
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:04,180
Father will be worried.
I'm leaving.

890
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:07,530
- Shall I walk you home?
- No.

891
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,720
What's this?
The stones are broken like this?

892
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:22,610
- I'm surprised too.
- We'll need tons of cement to put them in use.

893
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,080
You're right.

894
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:25,936
This is useless. Cancel this lot.

895
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,596
This isn't done, sir.
You always...

896
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:31,650
Quiet! You people want
money for nothing.

897
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:33,710
- This is unfair!
- Quiet!

898
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:38,250
You want wages for nothing,
but I don't want to go broke.

899
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:41,070
Go away! Cheats!

900
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,300
What do we do next?

901
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,930
After they leave, get the stones
loaded in trucks and send them.

902
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:11,540
I never expected him to
do anything so cheap.

903
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:17,080
Okay Ranjit, you go.
I'll meet the chief engineer...

904
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,340
- and arrange everything.
- Yes, sir.

905
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,760
Injustice? What injustice?
What rubbish are you talking?

906
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:31,370
Ramlal, ask your men to start work.

907
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:35,290
We won't start work, sir.
We've been cheated.

908
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:37,260
Our wages are deducted every week...

909
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,440
on the pretext of the stones
not being cut properly.

910
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,730
Until our earlier pay is restored,
we won't begin work.

911
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:44,560
Ramlal, talk sensibly.

912
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:49,090
- Don't threaten us, sir.
- You mean you'll argue with me?

913
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:53,900
You think I don't know?
I know who's behind this.

914
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:57,040
We aren't such fools
to not understand the truth.

915
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,720
I know the facts.

916
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:01,540
I'm sure Ranjit has accepted
bribes from some contractor...

917
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,180
to incite you against me.

918
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:05,550
Don't shift your sins
to me, contractor.

919
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:09,520
You want to defame me
to win your way.

920
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,430
Tell us, where did the stones
broken yesterday go?

921
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,400
- I don't know.
- But I do.

922
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:19,810
Your men, at your command,
sold the stones at night.

923
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:22,450
Shut up! If you talk any more,
you've had it!

924
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:26,920
We'll face what comes, but we'll
not bow before a cheat like you.

925
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:35,710
A cruel man always
raises his hand first.

926
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:41,320
You should know that the ease
with which they break stones...

927
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:44,330
they can even break the head of
a cruel man like you with ease.

928
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:48,010
- You'll have to apologize.
- Never!

929
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:52,080
- You'll have to apologize!
- So you're threatening me?

930
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:56,430
No threat, we want everything
to be decided with honesty.

931
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:59,936
You'll have to apologize!

932
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,670
Wait! What's going on?

933
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:06,260
On the one hand, we're preparing
to celebrate independence day...

934
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:08,870
and on the other,
you're bent on creating chaos?

935
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:13,400
Good you came, Mr. Mathur.
Ranjit is the cause of this riot.

936
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,360
He encouraged these people
and they've stopped work.

937
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,530
The one to whom you gave work,
gave a promotion...

938
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:22,710
he's not only defaming
your name, but also your work.

939
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:25,090
Mr. Mathur, you don't know,
but he...

940
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:31,880
I know very well what Ranjit is.
I also know the truth about you.

941
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,860
I've investigated the
charge the workers put on you.

942
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:37,566
The chief engineer has decided
that the workers...

943
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:41,350
will now work
for a government contractor.

944
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:43,070
Three cheers for the engineer!

945
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:48,170
- What are you saying!
- Your contract has been canceled.

946
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:50,870
You may begin work.

947
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:54,000
- Listen, Mr. Mathur.
No, Mr. Mohan

948
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:56,820
I won't hear anything more
about this matter.

949
01:48:57,380 --> 01:48:59,380
If you want to say anything,
come to my office.

950
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:03,060
Bravo, Ranjit!
This happened because of you.

951
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:04,780
Cheers for Ranjit!

952
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,210
Sit here. I'll go and inform him.

953
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:32,300
- You have business with me?
- Hello, Mrs. Mathur.

954
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:36,270
Hello. My husband came in the
evening and left again for work.

955
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,570
- I came to meet you.
- Tell me.

956
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,170
You must have heard
about my misfortune.

957
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:46,550
But you alone are
responsible for it.

958
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:51,840
I agree Mrs. Mathur.
But sometimes man makes mistakes.

959
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:54,730
And he can be forgiven for it.

960
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:59,700
Can't I be given another chance?

961
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:02,210
My husband understands his job well.

962
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:05,410
I don't consider it right
to interfere in his work.

963
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:10,920
- You're back?
- Yes, and I'm very tired today.

964
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:14,420
Mohan Singh came.
Did you see him on the way?

965
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:16,870
- No.
- He came apologize.

966
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:22,830
- He wanted one more chance.
- Never! I hate him.

967
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:27,100
He's so cheap that he can sell his
country for his personal benefit.

968
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:31,380
He left this envelope. Maybe
you'll change your mind after you see it.

969
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:40,130
- The brazen man! The rascal!
- What is this? Money?

970
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:43,450
A bribe! How disgusting!

971
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,460
- He left just now?
- Yes.

972
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:49,610
I'll meet him on the way.

973
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,016
What's this?

974
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,390
Killing him will mean
one less enemy of the country.

975
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:02,390
Give that to me!

976
01:51:08,130 --> 01:51:10,100
Wait! I'm coming, too

977
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,090
- Why would you come?
- I can't go alone at this hour.

978
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:51,450
You went to my house today,
and gave this to my wife?

979
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:54,100
- This money?
- Yes.

980
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:58,220
What are you thinking?
You're trying to bribe me?

981
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:01,410
- Don't misunderstand me, sir.
- I understand you only too well.

982
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,306
Because of greedy traitors
like you...

983
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:05,240
hurdles are put in
our country's progress

984
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:09,110
For your personal benefit,
you want to ruin millions of people?

985
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,720
I don't even want to see your face!

986
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:58,590
Come here.

987
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:02,210
Listen.

988
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:08,860
What are you looking at?

989
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:12,220
The stars.

990
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:18,140
Don't look at them.
People say stars change our destiny.

991
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:25,460
False! Father says that good people become
stars and shine in the sky after death.

992
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:29,960
- Rubbish!
- Really! Don't you know?

993
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:33,830
- No.
- The big stars are big people.

994
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:35,850
- Really?
- Yes.

995
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:37,790
Then even I'll become a star.

996
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:40,840
Why will you become a star?
What good work have you done?

997
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,230
I'm making the dam.
Isn't that good work?

998
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:49,190
Yes. Then you and I
will be together.

999
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,760
Know who has the right
to stay together?

1000
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:56,340
A wife.

1001
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:09,380
Gauri, before all these big
personalities today...

1002
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:12,730
I accept you as my wife.

1003
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:24,060
Oh naughty stars

1004
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:29,260
Don't look at us

1005
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:36,890
Our love is new

1006
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:47,280
Why does your
lovely face feel shy?

1007
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:59,490
Our eyes met and
the heart got scared

1008
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:45,320
Your naughty eyes lowered,
just giving me one look

1009
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:55,810
Tell me, what are you hiding
in your eyes?

1010
01:55:56,140 --> 01:56:00,640
I have stolen you,
and am holding you...

1011
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:10,730
in my eyes as kohl

1012
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:16,300
You stole my sleep.
You stole my heart

1013
01:56:55,950 --> 01:57:00,390
These wet sights
are making gestures

1014
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:10,980
This is the season to meet,
time favors us

1015
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:15,390
Hear what the stars say,
my darling

1016
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:25,220
I have seen the beloveds
of many separating

1017
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:41,700
- Sister!
- Gulab?

1018
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:48,610
- Yes, it's his voice.
- Hurry, let's go!

1019
01:57:58,510 --> 01:58:01,250
- Sister!
- What happened, Gulab?

1020
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,390
- Father was beaten.
- Who beat him?

1021
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:09,410
- I don't know.
- Hurry! Let's go.

1022
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,440
- Where are you hiding that boy?
- I don't know.

1023
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,260
You don't know?

1024
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:19,136
You're making your daughter
woo him for greed of gold...

1025
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,860
- and say you don't know?
- Shut up!

1026
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:25,010
Father... father!

1027
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:41,590
Father! Oh God!
Who did this to you?

1028
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:46,120
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

1029
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:49,350
- You're bleeding!
- Don't touch me!

1030
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:55,210
- Get out of my sight! Go!
- What have I done?

1031
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:58,530
You have tainted my honor.
You have cheated me.

1032
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:01,860
Cheated you? What are you saying?

1033
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:04,190
This is how you repaid
us for our decency?

1034
01:59:05,570 --> 01:59:09,340
You not only slurred Gauri's name,
you put my old age prestige to dust.

1035
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:14,190
You have misunderstood me, father.
I love Gauri. I want to marry her.

1036
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:18,230
Quiet! You think I
don't know the truth about you?

1037
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:22,540
I know all too well.
You're a criminal who's been to jail.

1038
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:24,820
You can't marry my daughter
as long as I'm alive.

1039
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,810
Oh. I sure am a criminal
who's been to jail.

1040
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:33,950
For a moment, I slipped.

1041
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,240
But I've told Gauri
everything about me.

1042
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,156
I didn't hide anything from her.

1043
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:43,300
- Father, he's not lying.
- You keep quiet!

1044
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:46,530
- And that gold?
- Even that's true.

1045
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:51,350
- Oh. So those two men were right.
- Who?

1046
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:53,310
The men who did this to me.

1047
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:56,750
Okay, now I understand.

1048
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:01,600
I thought many times
to tell you everything.

1049
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:05,040
- But I didn't get a chance.
- Or you didn't want to confess?

1050
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:10,820
You misunderstand me, Baba.
I don't yearn for that gold.

1051
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:16,490
Just think, the gold for which I
served a sentence of five years...

1052
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:19,840
I could have taken it and
disappeared whenever I wanted.

1053
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:24,350
- Then why didn't you?
- For Gauri's sake.

1054
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,440
For this dam, for the new world
that's being created.

1055
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:31,380
I'm not the same Ranjit anymore,
that come here.

1056
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:37,520
Living with you people,
I learned living alone isn't life.

1057
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:40,710
Life is living with everyone.

1058
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:45,610
And I tried to
become an honest man.

1059
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:50,586
- But you...
- Son!

1060
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:53,740
Ranjit... Ranjit!

1061
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,950
- What are you doing?
- Move aside, Gauri!

1062
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:03,020
What are you doing!

1063
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:09,430
What's wrong with you?

1064
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:13,570
I'm doing what I
should have done long ago.

1065
02:01:14,910 --> 02:01:16,810
I'll hand over the gold
to the government.

1066
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:19,770
Only then will I find peace.

1067
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:22,110
The tainted heart will be cleansed.

1068
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:25,710
Bravo, son! The human in
you has really awakened today.

1069
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:29,130
Son, I made a mistake
in recognizing you.

1070
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,610
Come on, dig.

1071
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:28,630
- Oh my! So much gold!
- Quiet!

1072
02:02:29,110 --> 02:02:32,740
Son, this is a very dangerous thing.
Take it from here now.

1073
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,196
Father, I'll come along too.

1074
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:39,550
No dear, it's late. Gulab is
alone at home. You stay here.

1075
02:02:39,790 --> 02:02:42,706
Father, come back soon.
I'm worried.

1076
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:44,330
Don't worry, we'll be back soon.

1077
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:50,710
- Gauri, close the door properly.
- Okay.

1078
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:42,830
Ranjit, you go! I'll handle them.

1079
02:04:58,190 --> 02:05:00,230
Ranjit has run away!

1080
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:16,270
There he is!

1081
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:02,560
He was just here.
Where did he go?

1082
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:04,900
Why are you asking me?
Look for him!

1083
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:06,170
Yes.

1084
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:35,000
- Father!
- Ranjit? Son, I'm here.

1085
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:39,000
- Are you hurt?
- Don't worry about me.

1086
02:07:39,150 --> 02:07:41,610
- Where's the gold?
- I've hid it amid stones.

1087
02:07:41,870 --> 02:07:44,260
- Could the rogues have seen it?
- No, they didn't.

1088
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:47,260
When the minister comes tomorrow,
I'll give him the gold.

1089
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:48,680
That's okay.

1090
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:54,090
Neither would I trust you,
nor would this mess happen.

1091
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:57,750
Because of you, my business in Bombay
was ruined, my contract got canceled.

1092
02:07:58,190 --> 02:08:01,060
- Now I'm losing the gold.
- Where can the gold go?

1093
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:04,080
He has surely hidden it somewhere,
or he wouldn't go back empty handed.

1094
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,320
- I left Chandar there to keep watch.
- Keep your thoughts to yourself.

1095
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:08,890
You're both useless.

1096
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:11,056
Now whatever has to be done,
I'll do it myself.

1097
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,350
Come!

1098
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:16,900
- Bhola.
- Yes, sir?

1099
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,086
- All arrangements have been made?
- Yes, sir.

1100
02:08:19,110 --> 02:08:20,710
- But who will garland him?
- You.

1101
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:24,090
- No.
- Then Mrs. Mathur?

1102
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:28,170
Why me? The one who inspired you
during this great task...

1103
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:30,770
of building the dam,
ask him to do this.

1104
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:33,280
- Who are you talking about?
- Laxmandas.

1105
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:36,670
- Right! Bhola, go and tell him.
- Yes, sir.

1106
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:39,290
Father, all arrangements
have been made here.

1107
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:42,140
- I should leave now.
- Go. But come back soon.

1108
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:43,480
Don't worry, father.

1109
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:24,810
Take a seat.

1110
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,600
Respected Minister, brothers and sisters...

1111
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:37,720
today, on 15th August is a very
big festival for free India.

1112
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:42,180
On this occasion, the Minister
has honored us by his presence.

1113
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:48,040
Thanking him for it, and on behalf
of the 30,000 people working here...

1114
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:49,860
I welcome him.

1115
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:05,480
- Laxmandas, you?
- You recognized me?

1116
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:09,050
- How can I forget you?
- I'm honored!

1117
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:19,440
- But why are you here?
- I work here.

1118
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,200
He's come!

1119
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:59,880
Mr. Mohan, there's not much time
to get the reward for our efforts.

1120
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:05,400
Whose effort? The effort is
only of one man. Me.

1121
02:11:06,790 --> 02:11:09,270
- What?
- You couldn't do anything.

1122
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:12,300
Your beauty, your style,
was all a waste.

1123
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:15,260
- Meaning?
- It's very clear.

1124
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,530
Only the one who gets something
has a right to it.

1125
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:22,030
That means, you don't want
to give me my share of gold.

1126
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:24,550
- No question of it.
- You're cheating me!

1127
02:11:24,690 --> 02:11:28,550
- Think what you like.
- But I will take my share of gold!

1128
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:00,730
- She's dead.
- Throw her in the river.

1129
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:13,830
Ranjit!

1130
02:12:17,350 --> 02:12:21,180
- Ranjit!
- Go catch Gauri.

1131
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:27,960
Now we'll see how
I get the gold now!

1132
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:47,326
- Mr. Mohan?
- Ranjit, give me the gold.

1133
02:12:47,350 --> 02:12:50,550
Never! I always suspected you
were involved in this.

1134
02:12:50,830 --> 02:12:55,410
Stop your nonsense! Hand over the
gold to me, or I'll shoot you.

1135
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:58,420
I'm not the kind to fear
the threats of traitors like you.

1136
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:00,690
Shoot!

1137
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:06,380
Not you.

1138
02:13:08,470 --> 02:13:10,070
Ranjit!

1139
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:14,980
If you care for her life,
hand over the gold to me!

1140
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:17,560
- Leave Gauri.
- I do business, Ranjit.

1141
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:22,410
I'll take gold with this hand,
and release her with this.

1142
02:13:23,450 --> 02:13:24,850
Give me the gold.

1143
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:29,090
- Give!
- No Ranjit, don't give him the gold.

1144
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:32,210
No Gauri, the gold isn't
more precious than you.

1145
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:38,390
Ranjit, don't give him the gold.

1146
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:52,180
- Oh my! Help!
- Gauri, you run away from here!

1147
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:55,880
No, I won't run away.
Help! Someone help Ranjit!

1148
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,410
Bahadur, take this!

1149
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:06,050
Ranjit!

1150
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:58,980
Ranjit, the mountain is
going to explode. Run!

1151
02:16:54,389 --> 02:16:55,639
Ranjit!

1152
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:20,630
Ranjit, Ranjit!

1153
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:25,900
Ranjit, why don't you speak?

1154
02:17:28,799 --> 02:17:33,489
Ranjit, why don't you open your eyes?

1155
02:17:36,570 --> 02:17:40,940
Gauri, take me from here.

1156
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:46,470
- Anyone around!
- Ranjit is badly hurt.

1157
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,210
Lift Ranjit.

1158
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:11,960
Father!

1159
02:18:24,139 --> 02:18:25,339
Father!

1160
02:18:28,110 --> 02:18:29,510
Father, take care of him.

1161
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:32,240
- Ranjit, what happened to you?
- Son, what happened?

1162
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:35,590
Laxmandasji, who is he?
What happened to him?

1163
02:18:36,350 --> 02:18:38,980
He's Ranjit, Mr. Sharma.
I told you about him.

1164
02:18:40,430 --> 02:18:48,430
- But he is...
- Minister, I had this over to you.

1165
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:59,750
The sin I committed,
it's atonement.

1166
02:19:03,650 --> 02:19:05,170
My job is done.

1167
02:19:06,510 --> 02:19:09,930
No... no! Ranjit!

1168
02:19:11,570 --> 02:19:15,480
No Ranjit, your work isn't
over yet. It's just begun.

1169
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:20,090
The country needs brave
young men like you.

1170
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:24,750
Ranjit, get up. The foundation
of the dam is calling you.

1171
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:29,510
- All your work is incomplete.
- Your life is very precious.

1172
02:19:32,129 --> 02:19:35,469
If man has courage,
he can overcome death. Get up!

1173
02:19:38,469 --> 02:19:41,889
Hear what everyone
is saying. Get up.

1174
02:19:43,389 --> 02:19:44,949
- Get up.
- Come, son.

1175
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:04,520
Hardworking man rose!

1176
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:20,420
The generous nature
will give everything

1177
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:25,740
All mountains on the way will
crumble, just sweat it out

1178
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:44,380
Hardworking man rose!
The destiny of earth shined

1179
02:20:44,410 --> 02:20:45,980
Great!

1180
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:51,436
That dust turns to gold
that we touch

1181
02:20:51,460 --> 02:20:54,360
- Hard work...
- Is what it's all about

1182
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:57,260
- Hard work...
- Is the real support

1183
02:20:57,310 --> 02:20:59,990
- Hard work...
- Is our slogan!
