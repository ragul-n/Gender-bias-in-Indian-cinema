1
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,199
All is here for the vacancy
to the quality department.

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,139
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

3
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,149
Do you want to hear a joke?

4
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,226
Once a man was
drowning in the river.

5
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,092
He yelled,
"Lord Ganesha, please save me!"

6
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,602
Lord Ganesha started dancing.

7
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,502
The man asked,
"Why are You dancing?"

8
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:46,010
So, Lord Ganesha said, "Didn't you
dance while immersing me in water?"

9
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,675
Actually, I shouldn't be cracking
jokes about God in front of God.

10
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,481
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.

11
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,112
Give my ball.

12
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,591
Hurry up! Quick.

13
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,252
Kids, are you okay?

14
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,333
Hey, mister!

15
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,068
Hello. Yes, you.

16
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,141
Aren't there enough
potholes in the city..

17
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,405
“that you've dug up another one?

18
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,968
And for the past two weeks.

19
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,706
Those kids and my
God were saved today.

20
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,611
Why are you so irresponsible?

21
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,154
The next time,
someone might lose his life...

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,621
...because of these potholes.

23
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,520
But whether someone lives or dies...

24
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,117
...it doesn't matter to you.

25
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,354
Don't worry, madam.

26
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,230
You'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

27
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,026
Okay.

28
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,589
Let's see.

29
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,658
I-Ii!

30
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,969
I just wanted to send
this message across that...

31
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,738
...I'm proud of you.

32
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:57,081
I'm sure that whatever you
do in life will be right for you.

33
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,315
No matter how many
obstacles you face...

34
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,014
...there won't be darkness anymore.

35
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,562
Hello.

36
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,472
Do you want to listen to the
bad news first or the worst news?

37
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,134
The bad news is that you'll
have to live without me every day...

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,975
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

39
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,009
And the worst news
is that I won't be able...

40
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,981
...to live without you
every day between 9 to 5.

41
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,548
I got the job, Aisha.

42
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,477
I got the job.

43
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,250
Now go and erase that
wish from your diary.

44
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,318
I've become independent.

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,721
Guru...

46
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,093
...there's something
that I have to say to you.

47
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:49,727
Tell me.

48
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,226
No, come home first.

49
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,238
Tell me. I'm on my way home.

50
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,671
No, come home.

51
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,502
Hello.

52
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,210
How did you get in?

53
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,237
Aisha?

54
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,045
What are you doing?

55
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:04,677
Who is“

56
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,944
Does anyone barge into someone's house
like that without ringing the bell!

57
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,314
Get out of here. Get out!

58
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,089
Aisha, who is it? What happened?

59
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,986
Aisha!

60
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,449
Aisha, who is it?

61
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,124
Aisha, listen to me! Police!

62
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,689
Aisha! Listen! Hey! - Guru!

63
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,501
Listen, you've enmity with me.

64
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,197
Look.. spare her.

65
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,640
You have a problem with me.
Listen. Spare her.

66
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,076
Guru!
- Hey, stop. Let my Aisha go!

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,242
Please! No!

68
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,019
Please don't kill me.

69
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,966
Please don't kill me. Please.

70
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,653
Who is in charge of this area?

71
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,516
I am. Inspector Waghle.

72
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,986
Aditya Rathore, CBI.

73
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,131
But why is the CBI so keen
on the murder of an ordinary girl?

74
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,367
lam keen not on this girl,
but her love.

75
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,234
I didn't get you.

76
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,040
We'll have to find Aisha's
murderer at the earliest.

77
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,303
If he sets out to look for him...

78
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,481
...then the government will
have to find some new property.

79
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,710
Guru will kill so many...

80
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,449
...that there won't be enough
place to cremate the bodies.

81
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,627
'Devil. Monster. Demon. Beast.'

82
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,602
'Who says that only
God has several names?'

83
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,974
'Demons are found in hell.'

84
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,443
'But I met one such demon
in the so-called paradise in Goa.'

85
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,951
'But demons possess
a special quality.'

86
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,453
'It's his habit to be
present at his own funeral.'

87
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,645
'Hatred is his weapon.'

88
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,215
'Anger is his explosive.'

89
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,457
'He doesn't know
what sympathy means.'

90
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,496
'No one loves him.'

91
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,399
'Every love story has a hero...'

92
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,966
...a heroine...'

93
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,258
'...and a villain.'

94
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,467
'But this love story
is of a villain.'

95
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,039
Please forgive me, Guru.

96
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,712
I made a mistake, Guru.

97
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,316
What are you doing?

98
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,487
Guru, please forgive me.

99
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,923
I beg of you, Gurul Please spare me.

100
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,982
I beg of you. Don't do this!
For God's sake, spare me life.

101
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,394
Are you Pfﬂymg?

102
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,929
Guru, please forgive me.

103
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,365
Do you really think that
He will appear to save you?

104
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,238
Fine.

105
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,109
Pray.

106
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,208
No! Guru.

107
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,043
You have time until
this matchstick is put out.

108
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,180
Remember your God.

109
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:37,687
Rohan

110
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,490
What are you doing? What happened?

111
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,048
What are you doing, son?

112
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,324
Rohan.

113
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,020
Rohan.

114
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,031
Mother, I'll kill him!
- Don't do this!

115
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,124
Please stop.

116
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,601
CBI People beat me up a lot.

117
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,297
Raghu. Please save me, o God.

118
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,173
Rahull Rahul, no.

119
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,037
Help.

120
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,973
Can I give you a suggestion?

121
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't pray to God.

122
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,277
Pray to the breeze.

123
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,541
Because if there's breeze,
you'll be finished.

124
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,078
No, no! Guru, please...
I made a mistake.

125
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,680
No, no! Guru, what are you doing?

126
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,220
Guru, please don't do this!
I beg of you!

127
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,353
No, Guru! Guru...

128
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,523
No, Rohan.
- No, leave me.

129
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,091
Guru!

130
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,296
Spare me, Guru.

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,307
Guru! Guru! No.

132
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,603
Guru! Spare me, Guru.

133
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,735
Spare me. Guru.

134
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,972
Let go of me!
- Let go off.

135
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,406
Guru, no.

136
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,747
Let go of me! Guru, let go of rne!

137
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,308
Please let go of rne!

138
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,719
Fine. I'll let go of you!

139
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,151
Brother.

140
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,730
No! No!

141
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,407
No!

142
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,410
No!

143
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,677
Come out.

144
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,613
Come on! Take him out.

145
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
Will you kill him? Leave.

146
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,026
Come on.

147
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,167
Tell me! Who is your boss!

148
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,302
Who do you work for!

149
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,404
Has Singh sir sent you?

150
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,507
Torture him.
Tell me about his business.

151
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,382
Hold him light.
All of you will be punished.

152
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,714
Hey, tell me.

153
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,285
Come on.

154
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,701
Ready, steady, smile!

155
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,967
Okay. A joke.

156
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,475
A woman went to the police
station and asked the inspector...

157
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,512
"Inspector,
my husband had gone to the market..."

158
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,546
"...to buy okra two days ago."

159
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,172
"He hasn't come back yet."

160
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,184
The inspector said,
"What's the big deal, madam?"

161
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,686
"Cook some other vegetable."

162
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,554
Wonderful! - Thank you.

163
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,460
Hey, come on.

164
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,657
What is the press doing outside?

165
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,664
So that your photos are
published in the newspaper...

166
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,670
...and people come to know
that you are the officer...

167
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,333
...who forbade an adult girl from
getting married against her will.

168
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,706
You're interfering in other people's
lives! Don't you have any shame?

169
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,040
Sheela is an adult.

170
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,476
And she came to me for help.

171
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,410
All of you treat her like a maid...

172
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,076
...who is only supposed
to do the household chores...

173
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,449
...and look after children.

174
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,284
When she demands to be happy...

175
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,153
...all of you have a problem with it.

176
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,050
While trying to belong
to a particular religion...

177
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,052
...you have forgotten
to be a human being.

178
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,694
Get aside. Move“ move.

179
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,697
Out. out from here.

180
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,227
Sharad, drive her out.

181
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,078
Because of your boss Caesar,
three officers of mine were killed.

182
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,387
The officers that
were doing their duty.

183
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,726
But I give you a chance.

184
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,695
I will make you my pet dog.

185
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,562
I will ask Deepu's
mother to testify...

186
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:53,167
...that her son accidentally
fell in the fire in a drunken state.

187
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,501
And being my pet dog...

188
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,507
...you will wag your tail
and take me to your boss Caesar.

189
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,346
It's your decision now.

190
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,623
You changed sides, didn't you?

191
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,959
She didn't testify against me.

192
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,094
That's the reason
why you're barking!

193
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,628
Will you speak up?

194
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,935
I will avenge Caesar for
killing my men at any cost.

195
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,667
I will make your condition
so miserable in prison...

196
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,277
...that you'll yearn for death.

197
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,609
People fear death.

198
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,109
But I face death each day.

199
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,017
As an uninvited guest.

200
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,254
Acting over smart.

201
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,559
You'll pay the price
for this insanity, Guru.

202
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,462
This is not insanity. It's manhood.

203
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,161
Lawyer, give the bail paper quickly.

204
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,474
Arjun.

205
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,348
ls everything alright?

206
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,650
Hey, listen!

207
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,159
Hey! Do you want to hear a joke?

208
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,560
Once a thief got
into a house to steal.

209
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,028
The safe read, "There is
no need to break open this safe."

210
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,034
"Press 1,2,3 and then the red button."

211
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,364
"The safe will open."

212
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,437
As soon as the thief
pressed the button...

213
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,565
...the alarm rang and
the police came there.

214
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,235
While leaving,
the thief told the owner...

215
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,643
"l have lost faith
in humanity today."

216
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,511
Hey!

217
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,574
The joke was not that bad.

218
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,385
You could have at least smiled.

219
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,623
Listen. I need you
to do something for me.

220
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,590
You don't have to rob a safe.

221
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,559
Someone needs to be kidnapped.

222
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,459
Will you do it?

223
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,996
I'm not asking you
to do it for free.

224
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,090
I'll pay You-

225
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,499
Show me your rate card.

226
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,195
I would have done it myself.

227
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,496
But just as we go
to a saloon to shave...

228
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,199
...and to a tailor
to get clothes stitched...

229
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,504
...similarly, won't we go
to a goon to get someone kidnapped?

230
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,442
Because you look like a villain.

231
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,647
Hey, villain!

232
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,321
Smile!

233
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,589
Come on.

234
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,294
Sahiba! Guru!

235
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,961
Wait. wait.

236
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,698
Pass the ball. Quick.

237
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,135
I sent you thereto kill.

238
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,338
Not to get killed.

239
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,553
I know that you're
not too fond of living.

240
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,059
But your life is priceless for me.
Priceless.

241
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,493
God blessed me with you.

242
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,598
You're my son.

243
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,157
You mean more than a son to me.

244
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,562
Stop looking for excuses to die.

245
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,437
Look for a reason to live.

246
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,976
Caesar.

247
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,534
Caesar.

248
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,511
Caesar.

249
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,478
I know him.

250
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,914
You're too much.

251
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:19,681
Don't you understand?

252
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,307
Hey!

253
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,214
How many times do I tell you?

254
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,115
Hey, villain!

255
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,016
Madam, you can't go in.

256
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,679
I know him. Let me go.

257
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,412
Hey, villain!

258
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,225
Yes! See, I told you I know him.

259
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:30,692
I-Ii!

260
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,586
As all of you already know...

261
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,121
...Mr. Caesar has done
a lot for the people.

262
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,394
Villain!

263
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,136
I'll scream even louder
if you don't come here.

264
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,563
Hey! Come here!

265
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,437
Yes. See, he's coming.

266
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,300
I told you...

267
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,574
Let go of my hand!
Why are you holding my hand?

268
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,474
You have no idea
what I can do to you.

269
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,487
It won't take me too
long to dispose your body.

270
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,283
Slop following me and leave.

271
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,499
Wow!

272
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,000
This is why I want to hire you.

273
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,974
I know you're not the romantic kind.

274
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,671
You're the kind that
would shoot someone on sight.

275
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,173
Get lost!

276
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,245
I'm sorry. Cool it.

277
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,686
Listen. You'll kill me...

278
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,683
...and unnecessarily and
go to prison free of cost.

279
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,184
The way I'm paying you,
if someone had paid you...

280
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,454
...to kill me, then it was worth it.

281
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,587
But who would pay to kill me?
I'm so cute.

282
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,324
Do you suffer from
a talking disorder?

283
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,366
I suffer from a lot of disorders.
Forget about that.

284
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,096
Tell me. Will you do it for me?

285
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,965
Please say yes.

286
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,370
Never refuse money.

287
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,411
We're going on such
an important mission...

288
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,009
...but we don't even
know each other's names.

289
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:03,644
I'm Aisha.

290
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,888
Guru.

291
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,893
Why are you so rude?

292
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,054
Just as it's compulsory
for Superman to wear...

293
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,597
...red underwear over his costume...

294
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,065
...is it compulsory
for gangsters to be rude?

295
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,199
You don't laugh or smile.

296
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,965
You don't even shave or bathe.

297
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,929
I know what you are.

298
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,936
Angry bird.

299
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,211
The game is inspired by you. Yes.

300
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,106
Like this“

301
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,244
Are you crazy or the one
who has to be kidnapped is crazy?

302
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,616
I'm not crazy.

303
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,422
It's Chhotu who's crazy,
just like a depressed lover.

304
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,085
That's why his family
got him admitted here.

305
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,185
They left him alone
and are settled in America.

306
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,524
Do you know what
they told the doctor?

307
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,655
That he's insane.

308
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,557
If I don't help him,
then he'll really go insane.

309
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,365
That's why...

310
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,570
We'll have to save him.

311
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,305
These are coins.
- Yes.

312
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,070
Do you want to hear a joke?

313
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,513
Let it be.
- Once... - I'll take the coins.

314
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,412
By the way,
you'll have to fight a few people.

315
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,655
You might get hurt.

316
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,250
If it was dancing,
I would have gone to a dancer.

317
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,222
But it's action.
That's why I had to come to you.

318
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,327
Because you are“ a villain!

319
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,366
Hey! Stop!

320
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:27,733
I'm stuck up here.

321
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,007
Each day should be like that.
This is fun.

322
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,607
Sometimes the players win,
and sometimes they lose.

323
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,544
But the dealer is always profiting.

324
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,655
Who are you?

325
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,332
I'm your father by relation.

326
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,636
My name is Shehanshah.

327
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,699
Shehanshah.

328
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:17,986
Where's Chhotu?

329
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,983
Where's Chhotu?

330
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,996
Chhotu, come with me.

331
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,028
Come on, Chhotu.

332
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:36,301
Chhotu!
- Aisha! Aisha! Aisha!

333
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,539
You're getting married, Chhotu!

334
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,076
Really?
- Yes!

335
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,271
Chhotu is going to get married.

336
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,369
Chhotu is going to get married.

337
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,185
"My life is in search
of its destination."

338
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,984
"ls this my destination?"

339
00:21:53,278 --> 00:22:01,026
"Why does my heart
say that I must halt here?"

340
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,966
"l have found new emotions."

341
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,596
"What kind of an effect is this?"

342
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:13,009
"I've found hope again."

343
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,706
"Someone has accepted it."

344
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,709
Where are you going, son?

345
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,580
Stay till the wedding.

346
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,180
I didn't even get
the chance to thank you.

347
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:32,688
"Like the poem of a poet..."

348
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,722
"...that calms one's mind."

349
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,668
"I've found someone -.

350
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,196
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

351
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,507
"Like the arrival of a new season."

352
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,174
"Or afternoons in winter."

353
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,619
"I've found someone -.

354
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,088
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

355
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,265
Sorry.

356
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,038
Did she kidnap all of them?

357
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,475
No.

358
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,639
'Blessing your name.'

359
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,681
In fact, she has helped them.

360
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,039
'Where the..'

361
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,483
Being her father,
I couldn't get her married.

362
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,345
But just wait and watch.

363
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,213
She will get all
of them married today.

364
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,168
"Just as a shore..."

365
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,240
"...helps a person relax."

366
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:05,516
"I've found her at
a juncture in life."

367
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,218
"Just as a star in the sky..."

368
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,993
"...spreads light."

369
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:21,334
"She spreads light in the city."

370
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,070
"I've forgotten my sorrow."

371
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,705
"What kind of an effect is this?"

372
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:37,945
"She is teaching me to live again."

373
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,688
"Just as the rains spread joy..."

374
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,423
"...or an ointment soothes the pain."

375
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,694
"I've found someone -.

376
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,260
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

377
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,642
"Like the arrival of a new season."

378
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:03,168
"Or afternoons in winter."

379
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,615
"I've found someone -.

380
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,142
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter." - Smile.

381
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,396
Mister!

382
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,455
Yes, madam.

383
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,557
The wedding is today.

384
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,198
Please hurry up.

385
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,202
Yes, I'm doing it.

386
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,347
Ouch!

387
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,189
"The smiling face..."

388
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,353
'...acts as a shield."

389
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,392
"l wonder what's
hidden in the heart."

390
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:10,279
"She shadows the others..."

391
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:16,911
"...while she stands under the sun."

392
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,247
"She is hurt..."

393
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:26,126
"...but why do I feel the pain?"

394
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:33,333
"What does my heart intend to do?"

395
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,504
"l was like a restless bird."

396
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,101
"l was wandering."

397
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:47,014
"I've found someone -.

398
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,417
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

399
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,980
"Like the arrival of a new season."

400
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,516
"Or afternoons in winter."

401
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,657
"I've found someone -.

402
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,629
"...just as a wanderer
finds shelter."

403
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,605
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

404
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,633
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

405
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,476
"Just as a wanderer finds shelter."

406
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,285
Uniting two lovers.

407
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,579
Aren't there any wishes for her?

408
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,147
There are. Of course.

409
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,986
But all her wishes are really weird.

410
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,393
Seeing a peacock dancing
in the first rain.

411
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,588
To fly like a wind.

412
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,097
Flying like the wind.

413
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,964
Catching a butterfly
and playing with it.

414
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,335
Touching the snow.

415
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,206
Being famous for a day so
that people know who this girl is.

416
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,711
Seeing the world under the sea.

417
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,975
It gets serious now.

418
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:56,445
And that is, to save someone's life.

419
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,619
Saving someone's life.

420
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,283
Guru, saving someone's life.

421
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,269
Uncle, carefully.

422
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,271
We're going to the graveyard.

423
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,533
She directly went to
the hospital from church.

424
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,384
Thank you, Guru.

425
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,050
For the coins that I gave you...

426
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,961
...you did much more for
Sheela and Chhotu than that.

427
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,296
No matter how you look...

428
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,427
...you're not such a bad villain
as you try to show the world.

429
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,199
You have some good qualities.

430
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,568
Much more than the bad qualities.

431
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,938
I'm not good! I'm very bad!

432
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,566
What do you think of yourself?

433
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,673
Do you think we live lo fulfill
your wishes in your diary? - No.

434
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,611
You click everyone's pictures...

435
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,080
...to show that you're
a very nice person?

436
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:33,616
No.

437
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,651
What do you try to prove
by cracking jokes every time?

438
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,652
Look at that. Look at death.

439
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,579
Do you want to make fun of it?

440
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,217
Crack a joke on it! Come on!

441
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,124
Life is playing the
biggest prank on me.

442
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,533
The biggest joke is that
death is laughing at me.

443
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,038
Yes, Guru.

444
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,203
I'm going to die.

445
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:08,241
These wishes that I want
to fulfill are my last wishes.

446
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:13,586
I don't even know if I'll be able
to fulfill all of them before dying.

447
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,055
I just...

448
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,130
...want to live my life
like such a party that...

449
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,328
...when death arrives...

450
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:29,297
...l want to sit and have a couple
of drinks with it before leaving.

451
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,281
It was very unfortunate, wasn't it?

452
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,057
But if you befriend the devil...

453
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,257
...it's bound to knock
on your door someday.

454
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,998
Your Caesar killed your Aisha.

455
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,127
But what will you do now?

456
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,698
How will you kill Caesar?

457
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,339
No. Let it be.
You won't be able to do it.

458
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,168
The one who taught you to shoot...

459
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,608
You will never kill him.

460
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,711
Let me do a favour on you.

461
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,982
I'll kill him.

462
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,645
I'll take your revenge.

463
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,311
I'll find him.

464
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,515
No matter where he is.

465
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,280
Where were you?

466
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,414
I called you so many times.

467
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,744
I even left a message.

468
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,588
Who were you having fun with?

469
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,289
Tell me.

470
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,359
It was dead.

471
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,528
My phone's battery.

472
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,571
Your phone's battery was dead.

473
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,105
But you were alive, weren't you?

474
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,435
You could have called
from a public phone...

475
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,497
...and informed that you'd be late.

476
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,008
But no. You will never change.

477
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,971
It's no use telling you anything.
- Listen.

478
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,607
Look,
I've brought a chain for you.

479
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,577
It'll look pretty on you.

480
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,158
Look at this. You brought
bangles for me last week.

481
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,623
They've turned black
in just one week.

482
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,561
I had gone to aunt Madhvi's
house for a wedding.

483
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,437
I was flaunting these to everyone
saying that these are gold bangles.

484
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,234
But then I realised that
it's not gold, but brass.

485
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,678
It's brass coated with fake gold!

486
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,345
Here are your bangles.

487
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,241
You wear these bangles!

488
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,979
You and those bangles,
both are a fake!

489
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,044
I just don't want to talk to you.

490
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,948
You will not stay
in this house today.

491
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,117
Get out of my house!

492
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,159
Just get out!

493
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,024
Listen to <i>me...</i>
- I said get out!

494
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,358
Sulu!

495
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,264
I really don't know how he was born.

496
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:17,495
Get out of my house.
- Sulu, listen to me.

497
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,535
Take this. come on.

498
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,974
Listen to <i>me...</i> - Get out!

499
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:21,476
<i>Sum.</i>

500
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,510
Get out of here!

501
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,939
Listen to me.

502
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,220
Father.

503
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,298
Take this.

504
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,102
Don't feel bad about
what your mother said.

505
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,010
She loves your father a lot.

506
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:02,613
To be honest, men like you are giving
the men of India a tough time.

507
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,085
If there are any more men like you...

508
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,455
...then men will lose our manhood.

509
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,656
Take this.

510
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,165
Darling. Come here.

511
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,998
Where's the ice!

512
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:22,994
I forgot to get it.

513
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,233
Get it now!

514
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,643
Look, Rakesh,
we are middleclass people.

515
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,378
We're sandwiched between
the upper-class and the lower-class.

516
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,180
The police torture us.

517
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,415
The ministers torture us.

518
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,117
The people torture us too.

519
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,128
Our lives are too stressed.

520
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,091
How do we get rid of it?

521
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,461
That's why men like us
come home and beat our wives.

522
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,500
There's no other way to vent
out our frustration, my brother.

523
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,369
I have another solution
to your problem.

524
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,201
Come to Mira Road with me.

525
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,577
There are beautiful dancers
in the dance bars over there.

526
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,644
Be an animal!

527
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,418
Bring out the beast in you!

528
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,947
Hunt!

529
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,598
"II"

530
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,574
'I just wanted to send
this message across that...'

531
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,977
'...I'm proud of you.'

532
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,240
'I'm confident that..'

533
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,311
'..now you'll do..'

534
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,020
'..everything right in life.'

535
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,581
'No matter how many
hardships you face.'

536
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,650
'Now there'll be no darkness.'

537
00:35:56,087 --> 00:36:00,627
"Why am I lonely?"

538
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:05,304
"Why am I living in pieces?"

539
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:15,278
"Why am I lonely?"

540
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,913
"Why am I living in pieces?"

541
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:27,423
"Why is my soul enduring this?"

542
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:34,393
"I'm incomplete."

543
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:39,271
"l say this every minute."

544
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,143
"l need you."

545
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:48,981
"l need you."

546
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,614
"l need you."

547
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,412
<i>Samba.</i>

548
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,578
Guru is here.

549
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:32,491
"l shared a deep
relation with darkness."

550
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,226
"You made me aware of light."

551
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:42,135
"I've returned to
this darkness now."

552
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:46,972
"But it seems unknown to me."

553
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,571
"Loneliness has left me."

554
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:56,107
"Isolation has
refused to accept me."

555
00:37:56,173 --> 00:38:00,986
"I'm incomplete."

556
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:05,585
"I'm a punishment for myself."

557
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,463
"l need you."

558
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:15,300
"l need you."

559
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,433
"l need you."

560
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,578
Stop!

561
00:39:51,389 --> 00:40:00,309
"I'm incomplete."

562
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,289
Put the pistol down!

563
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,603
Guru, today I learnt that
the value of dogs is known...

564
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,039
...only after a lion arrives.

565
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,469
Why did you kill her?

566
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,541
What? What did you say, Guru?

567
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,080
How could you even think...

568
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,708
...that the one who raised you
like a father and gave you life...

569
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,257
...would take away your
reason to live from you?

570
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:54,353
But if you still feel
that I've killed your Aisha...

571
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,460
...then take this gun.

572
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,260
Take it!

573
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,193
And shoot me!

574
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,562
Fire all the bullets in it at me!

575
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,970
Why did you kill her?

576
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:05,939
Shoot me!

577
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,602
Shoot rne now!

578
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,643
Shoot me!

579
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,305
Don't fear. Shoot me!

580
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,081
Guru.

581
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,019
Don't let this fire
in you douse, Guru!

582
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,667
Burn the world with this lava!

583
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,334
Then come back here!

584
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,000
To me!

585
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:43,244
Because a lion deserves
to be in the forest!

586
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,104
You are a lion! My lion!

587
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,343
You are an idiot!

588
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,385
You're completely useless.

589
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,479
Oh, God! Rakesh Mahadkar,
what do I do with you?

590
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,114
What is all this nonsense!

591
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,225
Madam.
- Brijesh!

592
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,637
I've made a lot of
money in the illegal deal.

593
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,401
I've brought your share honestly.

594
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,267
You're very naughty.

595
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,669
Why don't you explain
to your friend?

596
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,207
You're so active,
while he's the laziest.

597
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,614
He comes and asks
me what his chances are...

598
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,243
...for being the
employee of the month.

599
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,448
The Xerox machine in this
office works more than you.

600
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,649
The Xerox machine!

601
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,191
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

602
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,455
You don't have that talent.

603
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,589
Madam, he is a 2 rupee man.

604
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,190
It's true.

605
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,327
The Xerox machine in this office works
more than you. The Xerox machine!

606
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,340
Really, you are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.

607
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,636
Where are you lost?

608
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,739
Have you come here to repair
the phone or waste your time?

609
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,137
Lazy man!

610
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,744
That's why people don't have telephones
in their homes these days.

611
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,550
Your service is so bad.

612
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,417
When we call you, you don't come.

613
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,181
And when you come, you don't
even provide proper service.

614
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,416
Look, I'm warning
you for the last time.

615
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,119
If my phone doesn't work, then
I'll just get the connection cut.

616
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,958
Then I won't have to
tolerate lazy people like you.

617
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:08,519
And...

618
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,391
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

619
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,299
Have you come to
repair the phone or...

620
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:16,662
Madam.

621
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,297
Don't worry.

622
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,943
You'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.

623
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,412
'You shouldn't have yelled at me.'

624
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,276
Everyone makes fun of me.

625
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,646
They call me lazy.

626
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:34,988
They call me a beggar.

627
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,192
They abuse me.

628
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,961
'My friend Brijesh is right.'

629
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,261
'We're middleclass people...'

630
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,393
'...who are sandwiched between
the upper and the lower.'

631
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,699
'The world tortures us.'

632
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,067
'The system tortures us.'

633
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,298
And when we go home,
our wives torture us too.

634
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,672
Today I don't want you in the house.

635
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,972
Get out.

636
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,609
I said out.

637
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:02,083
Sometimes I feel like killing her.

638
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,921
But I can never
raise my hand at her.

639
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,291
I love my wife a lot.

640
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,251
<i>'My Sulo.'</i>

641
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,454
'Sulochana.'

642
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,024
'Sulo is her pet name.'

643
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,134
'She means the world to rne.'

644
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,094
'She means everything to rne.'

645
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,207
Creep! Who the hell
do you think you are!

646
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,298
Oh, I know who you are!

647
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,206
A bloody little pig!
- 'You know...

648
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,670
Frustrated pervert!
- You know what?

649
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,714
I've never even looked
at another woman but her.'

650
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,049
'Why should I?'

651
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,987
'My Sulo is so beautiful.'
- Look at his face!

652
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,651
'She could have found anyone.'

653
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,289
'But she chose me.'

654
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,058
What? Who are you?

655
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,321
Telephone maintenance.

656
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,328
I need to check your phone.

657
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,059
It'll be done in no time.

658
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,462
Fine. Over there.

659
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,307
She has all the right to yell at me.

660
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,476
Yes, I do feel very angry.

661
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:19,953
And instead of her,
when I kill other women like you...

662
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,290
...l feel much better.

663
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,262
'As all of you die...'

664
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,473
<i>'...I</i> get rid of all
my worries and stress.'

665
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,337
'Your pain doesn't make me happy.'

666
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,273
'It satisfies me.'

667
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,274
By killing you,“

668
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,554
...l keep my love alive.

669
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:52,422
And Hake a gift for
my Sulo from every corpse.

670
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,157
'Usually,
a person is born ordinary.'

671
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,057
'He lives an ordinary life.'

672
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,527
'He dies ordinarily.'

673
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,070
'If not on the big
screen or in the world...'

674
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:10,338
'...he should be a hero
at least in his house.'

675
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,103
'I want you to wear it.'

676
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,071
'VVho?'

677
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,116
'Her.'

678
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,218
'You.

679
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,417
'Whose necklace have
you stolen for me?'

680
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,453
'What did you say?'

681
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,654
'You think I'm a thief?'

682
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,060
Rakesh, what are you doing?
Leave it.

683
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:40,239
'My Sulo gets happy
when she gets a gift.'

684
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,339
'It makes rne happy, too.'

685
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,269
Eat.

686
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,340
'My family becomes a happy family.'

687
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,047
Are you dieting?

688
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,053
I do this for my family.

689
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,111
'For their happiness.'

690
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,120
'I have just one dream in life.'

691
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,092
'That my Sulo
considers rne her hero.'

692
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,658
‘That she tells
me that she loves me.‘

693
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,667
'So that even I can say to her...'

694
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,630
Madam, don't worry.

695
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,603
You won't have any complaints
against me henceforth.

696
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,120
A criminal always goes
back to the crime scene.

697
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,925
And a lover always comes back
to the place where he fell in love.

698
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,692
I sent you to Goa with high hopes,
to kill Caesar.

699
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,469
Can I tell you a secret?

700
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,938
He didn't kill your wife.

701
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,307
It was someone else.

702
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,641
A beast like you who's killing
women using different weapons.

703
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,280
But do you know what
his most special weapon is?

704
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,951
A screwdriver.

705
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:02,953
Look at this.

706
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:05,551
He has committed these murders“

707
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,893
..in such brutal ways.

708
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:12,131
It's difficult to make
out who's someone's mother...

709
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,032
...and who's someone's wife.

710
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,168
You're angry, aren't you?

711
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,271
You're furious.

712
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,944
But just as you didn't
let me take my revenge...

713
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,918
...l won't let you
take your revenge either.

714
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,649
Let's see who wins now.

715
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,984
Your love or my hatred.

716
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,606
Thank you! Thank you!

717
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,941
Bye, dear! Bye!

718
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,179
I want to help you fulfill
the remaining wishes in your diary.

719
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,195
Do you want to hear a joke?

720
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:16,392
Yes.

721
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,990
Forget it. I don't want to say it.

722
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,161
Because you'll listen to the joke
as if you're sympathizing with me.

723
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,133
Thank you.

724
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,339
But I don't need it.

725
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:32,141
I've breathed in this
city as much as I could.

726
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:38,143
Now it's time to fly to another place
and breathe for as long as I can.

727
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,915
My father was addicted to gambling.

728
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,025
He used to bet in cards,
cricket, everything.

729
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,364
And one day, he lost so
much that he bet on his life.

730
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:56,569
'I was 8 years old when my
parents were killed in front of rne.'

731
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,268
'I was hiding under the bed.'

732
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,983
'I didn't do anything to save them.'

733
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,719
'After that, people tried
to give rne shelter in their homes.'

734
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,181
'But I didn't want shelter.
I wanted revenge.'

735
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,351
'One day, I took my revenge.'

736
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,726
'I killed those people
who orphaned me.'

737
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,697
'I thought I'd be
peaceful after that.'

738
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,298
'That I'd be able to sleep.'

739
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,271
'But I was wrong.'

740
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,140
The other day,
when I helped Chotu with you...

741
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,977
...was the first time
that I slept peacefully.

742
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,710
I was relaxed.

743
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,091
Why did that happen?

744
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,433
Because for the first time,
you did something for someone else.

745
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,468
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.

746
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,563
Only light can do that.

747
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,272
Hate cannot drive out hate.

748
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,306
Only love can do that.

749
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,383
That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...

750
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,975
...is still over there.

751
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,250
He only needs someone's hand.

752
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,623
Someone's support.

753
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,521
Someone who can pull him out of
the darkness and bring him to light.

754
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,498
Unless we share
someone else's pain...

755
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:41,407
...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.

756
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:09,167
"This is where nightfall happens."

757
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:14,374
"This is where it's dawn."

758
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:19,307
"This is where I
have to live and die."

759
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:25,619
"This is where I find spirituality."

760
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:42,727
"This is where nightfall happens."

761
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:47,605
"This is where it's dawn."

762
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,707
"This is where I
have to live and die."

763
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:58,552
"This is where I find spirituality."

764
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,051
"Your home."

765
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,285
"Your home."

766
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:09,228
"l find solace in your abode."

767
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,227
"Your home."

768
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,360
"Your home."

769
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:19,464
"l yearn for your abode."

770
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,397
"You sleep in my slumber."

771
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:50,468
"You cry over my tears."

772
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:55,974
"Someone whispers in my thoughts."

773
00:53:56,366 --> 00:54:00,644
"l feel your presence
even when you're not around."

774
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:05,420
"You are the cure..."

775
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:15,518
"...to my pain."

776
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:21,302
"You're in my prayers."

777
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,964
"Your home."

778
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,268
"Your home."

779
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:31,278
"l find solace in your abode."

780
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,281
"Your home."

781
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,339
"Your home."

782
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:41,685
"l yearn for your abode."

783
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:07,238
"What kind of a
relationship do we share?"

784
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:12,680
"It has no name,
but it's still so deep."

785
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:17,617
"These moments are priceless."

786
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:22,663
"We might lose them."

787
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:31,264
"Let this moment..."

788
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:38,371
"...come to a halt."

789
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:42,577
"Don't go away from me."

790
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,684
"Your home."

791
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,250
"Your home."

792
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:53,556
"l yearn for your abode."

793
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,031
Aisha!

794
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,170
Aisha.

795
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,371
I slipped. I'm fine.

796
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,577
Aisha, you're not well.
Let's go back.

797
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,715
Are you crazy?

798
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,952
Peacocks dance only
on the first rain.

799
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,979
Since we've come this far,
let's wait for some time.

800
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,045
You can see it some other time.

801
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:56,988
Let's go back now. Come on.

802
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,157
I don't have much time.

803
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:25,017
The peacock danced already.
Come next year, sir!

804
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,280
It's going to rain heavily.

805
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,595
You're back?

806
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,565
It's impossible for her to survive.

807
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,261
Please don't waste my time.

808
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:42,669
I just can't help her.

809
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,111
Hey! Who do you think you are!

810
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,702
Are you God!
- What are you doing!

811
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,679
Back off! Are you God
to say that she can't survive!

812
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,676
Save her or I'll kill you today!
Save her!

813
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,618
If I could save her, then wouldn't
I have saved my wife first...

814
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,418
...who is dying each day with cancer!

815
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,189
In spite of being a doctor,
I am as helpless as you are.

816
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,198
If you have to try one last time...

817
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,542
...then take Aisha to Mumbai.

818
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,476
There's a doctor over there.

819
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,115
Prema Shrivastav.

820
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,315
'She couldn't help me.'

821
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,487
'But maybe she can help you.'

822
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:26,439
Guru, you fulfilled
so many wishes of mine.

823
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,067
Can you fulfil another one?

824
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,605
If I die before
fulfilling all these...

825
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,342
...then you fulfil the rest
of the wishes for me. Okay?

826
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,048
But don't worry.

827
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:44,213
Even after I die, don't
think that I'll leave you alone.

828
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,551
I'll always be with you.

829
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:49,689
Like the breeze.

830
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:58,936
Just close your eyes
and feel the breeze.

831
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,140
Whenever it touches your face...

832
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,041
...it would mean that it's me.

833
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,590
God, thank You.

834
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,401
Everything is perfect in my house.

835
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,166
Mother and father
don't quarrel anymore.

836
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,274
Please keep everyone happy.

837
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,573
And I promise to offer
my cars to you nine more times.

838
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,672
Thank you.

839
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,752
God, these are my favourite toys.

840
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,415
Take them away.

841
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,188
But please keep my family happy.

842
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,595
Can I help?

843
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,309
Did a girl give you this?

844
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,708
No. My father gave it to me.

845
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,655
What are you doing?
You're taking so long.

846
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,099
If we get late,
then the theatre will be full.

847
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,060
And anyway, you can't afford
to pay extra for the tickets.

848
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,965
Hurry UP-

849
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,010
We will get the tickets, Sulo.

850
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,306
Don't worry.

851
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,651
Why? ls it your father's theatre?

852
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,347
Did you get it as a gift?

853
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,085
Look, I'm warning you.

854
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,724
If I miss the hero's entry, then
I won't watch the rest of the movie.

855
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,626
Anyway, we get to see
a hero only on the big screen...

856
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,459
...and not in real life.

857
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,357
What are you doing, Rakesh?
Leave this.

858
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,266
Give it to me.

859
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,682
Give us some money.

860
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,118
I'll pray you two
always stay together.

861
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,024
Hold on.

862
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,427
Give us happily.

863
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,296
Give us some money.
- Give us some money.

864
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,026
Take this.

865
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,163
I don't have more than this.

866
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,563
Okay.

867
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,239
Why did you give them money?

868
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,741
They were harassing us.

869
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,012
If I hadn't given them money,
then they wouldn't have gone.

870
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,673
What kind of a man is he?

871
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,251
Anyone can take advantage of him.

872
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,355
Driver, stop. Please stop.

873
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,426
Why are you getting down?

874
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,189
I don't have money
to go any further.

875
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,293
What?
- I spent all the money, Sulo.

876
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,327
Driver, take this.

877
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,265
Come. Let's go.
- Leave him.

878
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,340
Go.

879
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,706
<i>But Sum...</i>

880
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,172
But what?
You think I don't have any money?

881
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,206
I've saved some money.
It's my money.

882
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:37,117
If I depend on you, then I'll
have to beg on the street someday.

883
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,992
Let's go, driver.
- But Sulo... how will I go home?

884
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,160
Just as you go everyday!
In the crowded train!

885
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,602
'I married you with many dreams.'

886
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,298
'But all my dreams have shattered.'

887
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,102
'Every small business man
has a car now.'

888
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,109
'But you'll always remain a beggar.'

889
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,736
'I'm ill fated. It's not your mistake.'

890
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,242
'You're an idiot.'

891
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:04,080
You're useless, man.

892
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,353
You're completely useless.

893
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,388
Then what happened? You know
what had happened on Christmas?

894
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,601
It's not your cup of tea.

895
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,475
You're running behind her.

896
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,136
But you'll not get her.

897
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,372
She won't listen to you.

898
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,540
But will you not listen to me?

899
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,140
I had told you.

900
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,118
Listen to me and do something.

901
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,625
Did you stop laughing now?

902
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,962
You were laughing at me,
weren't you?

903
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,630
All of you like making
fun of me, right?

904
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,172
The Xerox machine in
the office works more than me.

905
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,052
Call your Xerox machine.

906
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,253
To save your life.

907
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,618
Don't worry, madam.

908
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,559
Henceforth, you won't
have any complaints against me.

909
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,496
She slipped and fell.

910
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,898
When I came walking from there,
I saw her lying here.

911
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,957
Hey“ Help.

912
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,363
I won't let you die.

913
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,575
But I will still kill you every day.

914
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:46,041
Not once, but a thousand times.

915
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,981
You will face death each time...

916
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,075
...but it won't come to you.

917
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:55,418
The more you try to embrace death...

918
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,352
...the longer you'll live.

919
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:02,294
I will keep an account of
every drop of blood that you shed.

920
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,626
I will capture your last breath.

921
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,897
I'll hit you so much...

922
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,900
...that you will be in
pain as long as you're alive...

923
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,368
...and your soul will
scream after you die.

924
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,995
Hit me.

925
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,031
Hit me. Why do you spare me?

926
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,696
Hit me.

927
01:07:56,142 --> 01:07:59,248
Go in and get yourself treated.

928
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:00,586
First you hit me...

929
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:02,318
...then you save me...

930
01:08:03,316 --> 01:08:05,262
...and then you bring me
to a hospital and give me money.

931
01:08:06,453 --> 01:08:07,796
Who are you?

932
01:08:08,855 --> 01:08:11,563
lam the one who won't
let you die in peace...

933
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,695
...nor will I let you live in peace.

934
01:08:15,728 --> 01:08:18,208
Get the medicine.
Get yourself cured.

935
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,076
Because once your pain is soothed...

936
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:24,110
...once your wounds are healed...

937
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:27,647
...I'll be back to
inflict new wounds.

938
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:30,677
This is your fate now.

939
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:32,620
This is your punishment.

940
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:44,162
Mother, who hit father?

941
01:08:44,557 --> 01:08:45,399
Keep quiet.

942
01:08:45,658 --> 01:08:46,329
Go out.

943
01:08:49,762 --> 01:08:52,675
Listen. Stay inside the hospital.

944
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,475
Don't go out. Okay?

945
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,306
Your boss was attacked yesterday.

946
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:01,141
Today you were attacked.

947
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:03,478
Either the whole office
has a lot of enemies...

948
01:09:03,543 --> 01:09:05,352
...or you're each other's enemies.

949
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,482
Come on. Tell me from the beginning.

950
01:09:07,547 --> 01:09:09,549
Excuse me. What are you doing?

951
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:11,795
You're not allowed to give
outside food to the patient.

952
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,389
Do you want him to eat
the hospital food?

953
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,127
Do you intend to make him sick?

954
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:18,264
These are the rules of the hospital.

955
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:21,100
You're not allowed to give
the patient anything besides fruits.

956
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:22,231
Close your lunchbox.

957
01:09:22,295 --> 01:09:24,241
I'm closing it.
Can't you see? I won't give him.

958
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:25,173
But they didn't listen.

959
01:09:25,498 --> 01:09:26,374
I'm warning you.

960
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:29,542
This will not be tolerated here.
- Then they started hitting me.

961
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:30,512
I can't believe this.

962
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:33,779
You can't help it, sir.
Some people are very bad.

963
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,376
Fine. I'll come back for
more information.

964
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:36,749
- Show me those medicines.

965
01:09:38,244 --> 01:09:40,417
You've never even
killed a fly at home.

966
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:46,022
What was the need to hit goons
on the street and try to be a hero?

967
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:48,624
Look at your face.
Look what you've done to yourself.

968
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,394
Moreover, you got yourself
admitted in such a reputed hospital.

969
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:55,034
How will we pay the fees?

970
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:00,242
Take this.

971
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,744
For the fees.

972
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:13,123
This...

973
01:10:22,088 --> 01:10:23,761
I don't like to yell at you.

974
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:28,663
But if something
had happened to you...

975
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,067
...then what would my Manu have done?

976
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:35,769
I'm sorry, Sulo.

977
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,447
I love you.

978
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:52,459
What's this?

979
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:56,161
I just told you that he's
not allowed to eat outside food.

980
01:10:56,222 --> 01:10:58,498
Don't you understand
when you're explained once?

981
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:00,731
Security!
- Why are you calling the security?

982
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,606
What's your job?
To clean everyone's mess.

983
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:06,308
But you're behaving like a queen.

984
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:09,046
Sulo. - I wonder
where they've come from.

985
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:10,080
You leave.

986
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,239
Take care.

987
01:11:15,074 --> 01:11:16,109
I'm sorry, madam.

988
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:18,615
I shouldn't have any
complaints henceforth.

989
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:46,008
I can't get there.

990
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:05,226
God!

991
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,666
I'm sorry. I couldn't come
to pray this week.

992
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:16,738
Guru?

993
01:12:18,237 --> 01:12:19,648
Are you okay?

994
01:12:21,407 --> 01:12:23,011
Listen, I'm really sorry.

995
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:26,221
I can't believe that
this happened to Aisha.

996
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:29,182
God plays such
strange games with us.

997
01:12:30,216 --> 01:12:33,629
She was going to bring
a new life into this world, but...

998
01:12:35,088 --> 01:12:36,032
Yes.

999
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:37,763
She was pregnant.

1000
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,237
Didn't she tell you?

1001
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:45,007
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

1002
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:47,468
Please take care of yourself.

1003
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:14,402
Again this tube light
started flickering.

1004
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:17,507
There's no maintenance here.

1005
01:14:06,045 --> 01:14:08,025
The more you struggle...

1006
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,560
...the more it'll hurt.

1007
01:14:12,084 --> 01:14:14,724
If you slay calm,
I'll kill you lovingly.

1008
01:14:53,326 --> 01:14:55,670
You killed my baby.

1009
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:57,571
You killed my baby!

1010
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,405
She was pregnant.

1011
01:15:02,068 --> 01:15:04,048
She was pregnant!

1012
01:15:04,103 --> 01:15:05,275
You killed my baby.

1013
01:15:05,638 --> 01:15:07,379
She was pregnant!

1014
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,351
She was pregnant!

1015
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:11,012
She was pregnant!

1016
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:15,048
She was pregnant!

1017
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:17,519
She was pregnant!

1018
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,187
You killed my baby!

1019
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:23,157
He's dead! He's dead!

1020
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:37,109
Get up!

1021
01:15:39,272 --> 01:15:42,549
Get up!

1022
01:15:44,644 --> 01:15:47,591
You can't die so easily.

1023
01:15:47,647 --> 01:15:48,625
Get up!

1024
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:51,722
You can't die so easily! Get up!

1025
01:15:52,718 --> 01:15:58,293
Hey! You can't die so easily!
Get up!

1026
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:00,469
Hey! Make him alive.

1027
01:16:00,526 --> 01:16:04,531
Please let rne go! I won't tell anyone!
- Hey! He must live for rne.

1028
01:16:05,097 --> 01:16:07,043
He can't die so easily!

1029
01:16:07,099 --> 01:16:08,271
Bring him back to life!

1030
01:16:15,441 --> 01:16:19,184
Get up!
- He needs..

1031
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:25,218
This... has to go... in his heart...

1032
01:16:49,175 --> 01:16:51,280
He killed your baby.

1033
01:16:53,446 --> 01:16:55,483
Even then you saved his life?

1034
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:57,192
Why?

1035
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,994
Why didn't you let him die?

1036
01:17:01,654 --> 01:17:03,998
Spare my son, Guru.

1037
01:17:08,995 --> 01:17:11,032
The man who killed your son...

1038
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,708
...is he present in the court?

1039
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,308
Madam, is he present in the court?

1040
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,271
Answer me.

1041
01:17:23,142 --> 01:17:24,018
No.

1042
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,620
He's not here.

1043
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:30,986
Hold the police also.

1044
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:36,258
Deepu's death was an accident.

1045
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:40,168
Due to lack of evidence, Deepu's
death is declared an accident...

1046
01:17:40,226 --> 01:17:42,206
...and this case is dismissed.

1047
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:44,298
Accused is set free.

1048
01:17:53,305 --> 01:17:55,546
I haven't forgotten my son's death.

1049
01:17:57,076 --> 01:17:58,646
Nor am I scared of you.

1050
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:03,720
You want to know why I didn't
testify against you, don't you?

1051
01:18:05,117 --> 01:18:12,092
Because you will be punished
not by a judge in court but by God.

1052
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:15,197
How did you get away from
the bullets the other day?

1053
01:18:16,162 --> 01:18:20,167
Because He has a punishment
worse than death for you.

1054
01:18:21,534 --> 01:18:24,640
One day, your dear one
will die in front of you.

1055
01:18:26,338 --> 01:18:28,181
And you won't be able to save him.

1056
01:18:36,849 --> 01:18:38,624
Passenger, please pay attention.

1057
01:18:38,684 --> 01:18:41,358
Janshatabdi express from
Goa to Mumbai“

1058
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,128
..will depart from platform number <i>6</i>
on it's scheduled time.

1059
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,227
Aisha.

1060
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:48,033
You're always running in life.

1061
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:51,038
From one place to another.

1062
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:54,510
Who are you running away from today?

1063
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,612
I'm not running away from anyone.

1064
01:18:56,669 --> 01:19:00,708
Look, dear,
there is a kind of laughter...

1065
01:19:00,773 --> 01:19:05,017
...which a person learns
to hide his sorrow in life.

1066
01:19:05,644 --> 01:19:07,487
And there is another
kind of laughter...

1067
01:19:07,813 --> 01:19:10,589
...that helps a person
forget all his sorrow.

1068
01:19:11,617 --> 01:19:15,087
You've found this laughter
after meeting Guru.

1069
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:18,268
You've found it in his love.

1070
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,729
What's the use of this love...

1071
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:26,469
...that will make him
cry after making him smile?

1072
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:30,239
I'm not running away from him.

1073
01:19:32,738 --> 01:19:35,082
I'm just stopping him
from running after me.

1074
01:19:35,141 --> 01:19:35,642
Aisha!

1075
01:19:36,442 --> 01:19:37,284
Aisha!

1076
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:44,383
Aisha!

1077
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:48,190
Aisha!

1078
01:20:02,101 --> 01:20:02,704
Aisha.

1079
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:04,007
Aisha!

1080
01:20:04,537 --> 01:20:05,345
Do you want to hear a joke?

1081
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:08,618
Once, a man was drowning in the sea.

1082
01:20:09,575 --> 01:20:11,782
He started praying
to God to save him.

1083
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:13,152
A fishing boat came.

1084
01:20:14,246 --> 01:20:15,520
He said, "Give me your hand."

1085
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,753
The man said, "No.
God will save me."

1086
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:19,655
Then a ship came.

1087
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:21,424
The captain said, "Hold my hand."

1088
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:24,167
He said, "No. God will save me."

1089
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:25,531
The man drowned.

1090
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:30,238
After his death, he asked God,
"Why didn't You save me?"

1091
01:20:30,296 --> 01:20:33,470
God said, "You think your
father sent that boat and ship?"

1092
01:20:38,704 --> 01:20:42,584
Aisha, I know that I might
not be able to save you from dying.

1093
01:20:44,076 --> 01:20:47,285
But by holding my hand,
you can keep me alive.

1094
01:20:49,648 --> 01:20:51,286
Hold my hand, Aisha.

1095
01:20:52,318 --> 01:20:54,423
And get me out of
darkness into light.

1096
01:20:56,322 --> 01:20:57,699
Hold my hand, Aisha!

1097
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,663
Pull me out of darkness
into light, Aisha!

1098
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,773
Aisha, don't go.

1099
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:08,544
Aisha!

1100
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,343
Aisha, don't go.

1101
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,484
Aisha, don't leave me.

1102
01:21:27,219 --> 01:21:29,460
Aisha.

1103
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:19,372
Hey! Who pulled the chain?

1104
01:22:27,313 --> 01:22:37,030
"Why does life comprise
of just a few moments?"

1105
01:22:37,823 --> 01:22:42,101
"Even centuries..."

1106
01:22:42,494 --> 01:22:47,409
"mare not enough for love."

1107
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:53,081
"l want to ask God..."

1108
01:22:53,138 --> 01:22:58,087
"...for some more time."

1109
01:22:58,377 --> 01:23:03,053
"l want to stay here forever."

1110
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:09,288
"l don't want to be away from you."

1111
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:14,429
"When you're my companion."

1112
01:23:14,493 --> 01:23:19,374
"When you're my companion."

1113
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:24,647
"No pain seems painful."

1114
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:30,448
"When you're my companion."

1115
01:23:30,743 --> 01:23:33,155
After meeting Aisha,
I've realised...

1116
01:23:33,212 --> 01:23:35,055
...that it's very
easy to kill someone.

1117
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:37,661
But it's very difficult
to save someone's life.

1118
01:23:40,686 --> 01:23:42,097
You may kill me if you want.

1119
01:23:43,088 --> 01:23:45,034
But I won't kill anyone again.

1120
01:24:01,673 --> 01:24:03,016
Go.

1121
01:24:05,277 --> 01:24:07,553
Go. I'm fine.

1122
01:24:13,185 --> 01:24:18,396
"Your smile is my strength."

1123
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:23,702
"I've found hope because of it."

1124
01:24:23,762 --> 01:24:29,110
"No matter how much
the world torments me..."

1125
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:33,708
"...l find solace in it."

1126
01:24:33,772 --> 01:24:39,245
"Life has become beautiful."

1127
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:44,590
"This is heaven."

1128
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,326
"When you're my companion."

1129
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:54,533
"When you're my companion."

1130
01:24:55,127 --> 01:25:00,440
"No pain seems painful."

1131
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:05,244
"When you're my companion."

1132
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,084
These are Aisha's latest
pathological tests.

1133
01:25:29,328 --> 01:25:30,329
Here's your dairy.

1134
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:35,605
You have time to fulfill
every wish of yours.

1135
01:25:37,102 --> 01:25:39,673
We have the time.
- Yes.

1136
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:43,486
We will fulfill it together.
- Yes.

1137
01:25:46,178 --> 01:25:47,418
You have the rest
of your life, Aisha.

1138
01:25:51,483 --> 01:25:53,053
You have the rest of your life.

1139
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,226
You will live, Aisha.

1140
01:25:57,556 --> 01:25:58,534
You will live, Aisha.

1141
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:00,963
You will live.

1142
01:26:09,635 --> 01:26:14,584
"My life depends
on your heartbeats."

1143
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,285
"Your desires are now my prayers."

1144
01:26:20,345 --> 01:26:25,556
"This is such an unusual bond."

1145
01:26:25,617 --> 01:26:30,293
"We're one now."

1146
01:26:30,355 --> 01:26:35,498
"l will come back to you."

1147
01:26:35,561 --> 01:26:41,102
"l promise you."
"Even if I die."

1148
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:46,343
"When you're my companion."

1149
01:26:46,405 --> 01:26:50,683
"When you're my companion."

1150
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:57,083
"No pain seems painful."

1151
01:26:57,149 --> 01:27:02,223
"When you're my companion."

1152
01:27:02,287 --> 01:27:06,997
"When you're my companion."

1153
01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:12,166
"When you're my companion."

1154
01:27:13,031 --> 01:27:18,242
"When you're my companion."

1155
01:27:18,303 --> 01:27:23,218
"When you're my companion."

1156
01:27:27,546 --> 01:27:28,320
ls this okay?

1157
01:27:28,814 --> 01:27:30,384
You look like a hero.

1158
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:32,395
If I was the interviewer,
do you know what I would have done?

1159
01:27:34,519 --> 01:27:36,362
Wait. Let me get curd
and sugar for good luck.

1160
01:27:41,393 --> 01:27:42,303
Hi, Dr. Prema.

1161
01:27:42,594 --> 01:27:44,164
Aisha, your reports have come.

1162
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,173
And they state that you're pregnant.

1163
01:27:49,268 --> 01:27:50,713
Aisha!

1164
01:27:51,403 --> 01:27:53,440
Are you there?
- Yeah.

1165
01:27:54,673 --> 01:27:55,651
Doctor...

1166
01:27:57,809 --> 01:28:00,585
Will my illness have
a negative effect on my baby?

1167
01:28:01,313 --> 01:28:04,851
No, Aisha.
Your baby is not in danger.

1168
01:28:04,983 --> 01:28:06,860
But I'm concerned about you.

1169
01:28:07,185 --> 01:28:10,689
Aisha, I don't think you have the
strength to give birth to this baby.

1170
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,731
You've just come into
remission from your illness.

1171
01:28:14,259 --> 01:28:16,569
Your body is still very weak.

1172
01:28:17,195 --> 01:28:22,645
I think you should tell Guru
about your pregnancy and this risk.

1173
01:28:23,702 --> 01:28:26,683
'He's the father of this child.
He has a right to know.'

1174
01:28:27,172 --> 01:28:30,278
'You both must take this decision
and that too very quickly.'

1175
01:28:30,342 --> 01:28:32,219
Aisha, what are you doing?
It's behind.

1176
01:28:39,618 --> 01:28:40,323
Listen.

1177
01:28:46,258 --> 01:28:47,236
Best of luck.

1178
01:29:56,128 --> 01:29:59,735
Aisha, are you sure
you want this child?

1179
01:30:00,465 --> 01:30:02,308
Did you tell Guru?

1180
01:30:03,802 --> 01:30:05,281
I will tell him.

1181
01:30:07,339 --> 01:30:08,682
I'm just afraid...

1182
01:30:10,675 --> 01:30:15,249
...that if he feels that something might
happen to me because of this baby...

1183
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:19,025
...then he'll try to stop me.

1184
01:30:19,618 --> 01:30:21,393
But his fear is justified, dear.

1185
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,734
But this life that
I've got because of Guru...

1186
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:37,779
...is playing
hide-and-seek with death.

1187
01:30:39,638 --> 01:30:42,118
It has to end someday.

1188
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,715
Then my Guru will be
back into the darkness.

1189
01:30:50,382 --> 01:30:54,455
He will need someone then,
who'll hold his hand...

1190
01:30:54,519 --> 01:30:56,089
...and bring him into light.

1191
01:30:56,755 --> 01:30:58,359
And the one who'll hold his hand...

1192
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:01,399
...will be our child.

1193
01:31:05,831 --> 01:31:07,469
My child, light and darkness means life.

1194
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,479
Now, He'll show you the correct path.

1195
01:31:13,605 --> 01:31:16,552
The Lord's and my blessings
are always with you.

1196
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,617
Have you worked somewhere earlier?

1197
01:31:30,722 --> 01:31:33,328
Actually, I shouldn't crack
jokes about God in front of God.

1198
01:31:33,391 --> 01:31:36,395
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.

1199
01:31:36,461 --> 01:31:37,462
Catch“ catch.

1200
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:42,270
Oh gosh!

1201
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:51,746
Hey, mister!
Yes, I'm talking to you.

1202
01:31:52,277 --> 01:31:54,985
Aren't there enough potholes in the
city that you've dug another one?

1203
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,326
For the past two weeks.

1204
01:31:57,382 --> 01:31:59,692
Those kids and my God were
saved by a hair's breadth today.

1205
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:00,752
'All my dreams have shattered.'

1206
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:03,396
'It's not your mistake,
I'm ill fated.'

1207
01:32:03,455 --> 01:32:05,594
'I had many choices.'

1208
01:32:05,657 --> 01:32:08,103
'But I was ill fated to marry you.'

1209
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,002
'Middle class man.'

1210
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:12,274
Don't worry, madam.

1211
01:32:12,664 --> 01:32:14,769
You won't have any
complaints henceforth.

1212
01:32:15,066 --> 01:32:17,546
Fine. Let's see.

1213
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:23,683
Hello.

1214
01:32:24,476 --> 01:32:26,114
Do you want to hear the
bad news first or the worst news?

1215
01:32:26,511 --> 01:32:28,422
The bad news is that you'll
have to live without me every day...

1216
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,754
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

1217
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:33,393
And the worst news is that I
won't be able to live without you...

1218
01:32:33,451 --> 01:32:34,725
...between 9 to 5 from now on.

1219
01:32:35,287 --> 01:32:36,459
I got the job, Aisha.

1220
01:32:37,455 --> 01:32:38,433
I got the job.

1221
01:32:39,491 --> 01:32:40,629
I'm independent now.

1222
01:32:41,526 --> 01:32:45,406
Guru, there's something
that I have to say to you.

1223
01:32:45,764 --> 01:32:46,469
Tell me.

1224
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:49,001
No. Come home first.

1225
01:32:49,067 --> 01:32:50,637
Tell me. I'm on my way home.

1226
01:32:51,036 --> 01:32:52,208
No, come home.

1227
01:32:55,273 --> 01:32:57,685
Hello. How did you get in?

1228
01:32:57,742 --> 01:32:58,584
Aisha?

1229
01:33:00,245 --> 01:33:01,246
What are you doing?
- Aisha?

1230
01:33:01,713 --> 01:33:03,192
Does anyone barge
into someone's house...

1231
01:33:03,248 --> 01:33:04,226
...without ringing the bell?

1232
01:33:04,282 --> 01:33:05,454
Get out of here!

1233
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:08,587
Aisha, who's over there? Aisha!

1234
01:33:10,422 --> 01:33:12,527
Who is it? What happened, Aisha?

1235
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:15,029
Hey! Aisha!

1236
01:33:15,393 --> 01:33:17,430
Listen! Whoever you are,
you're my enemy.

1237
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:20,777
Guru!

1238
01:33:20,832 --> 01:33:22,470
It's not her mistake.
Spare her. Aisha!

1239
01:33:22,534 --> 01:33:25,242
Hey! Listen! Spare her. Aisha!

1240
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:26,741
Aisha!
- Guru!

1241
01:33:27,072 --> 01:33:28,449
Stop! Taxi! Stop!

1242
01:33:28,506 --> 01:33:32,079
Aisha! - Guru!
- Aisha! I'm coming.

1243
01:33:34,179 --> 01:33:35,351
Help me.

1244
01:33:40,585 --> 01:33:41,620
I'm pregnant.

1245
01:33:44,422 --> 01:33:46,026
Please don't kill me.

1246
01:33:49,027 --> 01:33:51,098
I want to give birth to this baby.

1247
01:33:52,664 --> 01:33:54,075
I want to have this child.

1248
01:33:56,267 --> 01:33:57,575
Please don't kill me.

1249
01:33:57,636 --> 01:34:01,243
Stop! Taxi, stop.

1250
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:29,234
Hurry up, deep-

1251
01:36:07,298 --> 01:36:08,208
HI.

1252
01:36:09,467 --> 01:36:12,505
Am I disturbing you?

1253
01:36:14,506 --> 01:36:17,976
I see. You were following Rakesh.

1254
01:36:19,043 --> 01:36:19,612
Go.

1255
01:36:22,213 --> 01:36:23,157
Run.

1256
01:36:24,516 --> 01:36:25,654
Run!

1257
01:36:26,785 --> 01:36:28,162
Hey, back off.

1258
01:36:28,419 --> 01:36:29,591
Back“

1259
01:36:29,654 --> 01:36:31,531
Just a minute, Madam. Madam.

1260
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,134
Madam, do you know
where your husband is?

1261
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:36,194
Please, let us go.

1262
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:39,504
We didn't do anything.

1263
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:42,702
I think there's
some misunderstandings.

1264
01:36:43,168 --> 01:36:45,239
My husband didn't do anything.

1265
01:36:45,303 --> 01:36:46,941
Do you remember what I told you?

1266
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:50,486
Whenever you try to take
your revenge, I'll come in your way.

1267
01:36:51,209 --> 01:36:52,085
Do you remember!

1268
01:37:01,252 --> 01:37:03,289
I know you're not
scared of my bullet.

1269
01:37:04,455 --> 01:37:07,993
You know that if you follow him,
then the police will catch him.

1270
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:12,039
His crime will be proved and your
revenge will be left incomplete.

1271
01:37:17,135 --> 01:37:19,308
<i>Rakes!“!</i>

1272
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,247
Get inside.

1273
01:37:23,174 --> 01:37:25,381
The police will catch
Rakesh Mahadkar eventually.

1274
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:27,987
Because his wife
is in their custody.

1275
01:37:28,513 --> 01:37:31,619
But for now,
let's go to the police station.

1276
01:37:32,483 --> 01:37:34,622
Someone's waiting
for you over there.

1277
01:37:47,065 --> 01:37:48,339
Hey!

1278
01:37:49,067 --> 01:37:50,341
You got beaten again?

1279
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:51,402
Will you come with me to Mira Road?

1280
01:37:51,803 --> 01:37:53,282
Mira Road!

1281
01:37:53,338 --> 01:37:54,783
You've become a man!

1282
01:37:55,073 --> 01:37:56,211
Take me away from here.

1283
01:37:56,274 --> 01:38:00,620
After being beaten, you
want someone to heal your wounds.

1284
01:38:00,678 --> 01:38:05,184
Rakesh Mahadkar is the one
who killed women in the city.

1285
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,490
He's absconding.

1286
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:09,532
But police is making all
the efforts to nab him.

1287
01:38:10,655 --> 01:38:12,134
Look there.

1288
01:38:23,134 --> 01:38:29,642
"The world wants to
touch me in such a way..."

1289
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:39,294
"was if I belong to them."

1290
01:38:41,519 --> 01:38:48,095
"The world looks at my beauty."

1291
01:38:50,795 --> 01:38:56,711
"No one understands
my helplessness."

1292
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:06,244
"I'm shattered completely."

1293
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:08,552
Wow!

1294
01:39:08,613 --> 01:39:16,623
"I've gone crazy in your love."

1295
01:39:17,655 --> 01:39:26,075
"I'm shattered completely."

1296
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,108
Come on.

1297
01:39:27,165 --> 01:39:34,447
"I've gone crazy in your love."

1298
01:39:39,344 --> 01:39:41,051
You're lying.

1299
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,555
Sir, Hold you.

1300
01:39:44,615 --> 01:39:48,028
The one who saved
my life was a saviour.

1301
01:39:48,086 --> 01:39:50,123
I couldn't recognise him.

1302
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:51,695
Tell me something.

1303
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:52,761
Note down the details.

1304
01:39:52,824 --> 01:39:54,098
Whether old or young...

1305
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:56,365
...why doesn't any woman
testify against you?

1306
01:39:58,563 --> 01:40:01,772
Do you have a mole at
a special place in your body?

1307
01:40:03,267 --> 01:40:05,213
Wagle, take him in the custody.

1308
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:17,382
"Some call me their pride."

1309
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:22,029
"Some pay me a price."

1310
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,359
"l smile at them."

1311
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:31,637
"But I'm crying from within."

1312
01:40:31,696 --> 01:40:36,145
"You were priceless."

1313
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:40,615
"You would talk a lot."

1314
01:40:41,506 --> 01:40:46,080
"Since you're quiet..."

1315
01:40:46,144 --> 01:40:52,322
"...you've taken all
my happiness away."

1316
01:40:57,121 --> 01:41:05,063
"I'm shattered."

1317
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:14,775
"I'm ruined in your love."

1318
01:41:15,306 --> 01:41:22,087
"l belong lo you completely."

1319
01:41:24,615 --> 01:41:32,033
"I've been bought by you."

1320
01:41:50,808 --> 01:41:54,688
I always thought you were a loser.

1321
01:41:55,346 --> 01:41:59,294
But you proved me wrong.

1322
01:41:59,717 --> 01:42:04,063
Do you know how many
blessings you must have got...

1323
01:42:04,122 --> 01:42:06,124
...from those men
whose wives you killed?

1324
01:42:06,557 --> 01:42:10,198
But what did my friendship lack?

1325
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:13,505
Why did you spare my wife?

1326
01:42:14,665 --> 01:42:16,736
Why are you sitting here?

1327
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,081
Hey, handsome.
Will you come to the pool?

1328
01:42:21,139 --> 01:42:22,618
Hey, hot baby!

1329
01:42:24,108 --> 01:42:25,712
Tell me something.

1330
01:42:25,776 --> 01:42:30,191
Do you want to sing a solo song
with him or a duet with both of us?

1331
01:42:30,248 --> 01:42:34,492
Looks like your friend is neither
interested in a solo, nor in a duet.

1332
01:42:34,552 --> 01:42:39,501
I think he's either
impotent or he likes men.

1333
01:42:39,557 --> 01:42:45,098
You're talking too much.
But you don't know my friend.

1334
01:42:45,163 --> 01:42:49,270
Brother, you'll have to shut her up.

1335
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:51,040
Come on. Have a drink.

1336
01:42:52,203 --> 01:42:53,739
Darling, where's the ice?

1337
01:42:54,172 --> 01:42:56,049
I'll just get it.

1338
01:42:57,241 --> 01:43:03,021
Hot girls forget to
get the coldest thing.

1339
01:43:05,316 --> 01:43:07,227
Who is this man who's after me?

1340
01:43:08,085 --> 01:43:11,498
He too is his wife's lover,
just like you.

1341
01:43:13,724 --> 01:43:17,729
I'm sure he's the husband
Of one of the women that you killed.

1342
01:43:17,795 --> 01:43:19,001
I'm sure.

1343
01:43:19,297 --> 01:43:20,298
100 percent.

1344
01:43:23,601 --> 01:43:25,547
He's playing with you.

1345
01:43:26,304 --> 01:43:29,615
Just as a lion plays
with his prey in the forest.

1346
01:43:30,374 --> 01:43:33,514
He catches it and then let's it go,
and then catches it again.

1347
01:43:34,145 --> 01:43:37,683
He chases it, catches it and
then let's it go again.

1348
01:43:40,084 --> 01:43:45,295
Until you keep running,
he'll keep chasing you.

1349
01:43:46,324 --> 01:43:50,636
The day you turn the tables,
you'll be the hunter.

1350
01:43:51,696 --> 01:43:53,403
And he'll be the prey.

1351
01:43:58,703 --> 01:44:00,614
'I won't let you die.'

1352
01:44:02,173 --> 01:44:04,210
'But I will still
kill you every day.'

1353
01:44:04,475 --> 01:44:07,217
'The more you try
to embrace death...'

1354
01:44:08,045 --> 01:44:09,991
'...the longer you'll live.'

1355
01:44:19,757 --> 01:44:21,737
'She was pregnant.'

1356
01:44:23,394 --> 01:44:24,998
'You killed my baby.
She was pregnant.'

1357
01:44:27,064 --> 01:44:28,236
'I'm pregnant.'

1358
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:30,772
'I want to give birth to this baby.'

1359
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:35,041
'Guru!'

1360
01:44:38,276 --> 01:44:40,051
My husband is the most kind...

1361
01:44:40,745 --> 01:44:45,057
...truthful and decent
man in the world.

1362
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:48,054
He would murder someone...

1363
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,564
That's impossible.

1364
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:56,434
This is Guru's conspiracy.

1365
01:44:57,762 --> 01:45:02,074
Maybe, he killed his wife too.

1366
01:45:03,067 --> 01:45:05,069
And also those women.

1367
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,981
I'm telling you.

1368
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:09,746
Even the police
are involved in this.

1369
01:45:10,675 --> 01:45:12,279
They are involved with Guru.

1370
01:45:14,545 --> 01:45:18,516
They will kill my husband
and accuse him of everything.

1371
01:45:20,318 --> 01:45:23,128
I beg of you.

1372
01:45:23,788 --> 01:45:25,267
Please save my Rakesh.

1373
01:45:26,524 --> 01:45:27,696
Please save my Rakesh.

1374
01:45:30,127 --> 01:45:31,105
Lord!

1375
01:45:33,597 --> 01:45:36,077
Please send my Rakesh back to me.

1376
01:45:37,368 --> 01:45:39,041
I promise You.

1377
01:45:40,271 --> 01:45:44,242
I will never ask him to leave the house.
I'll never fight with him.

1378
01:45:47,311 --> 01:45:50,520
Please send my Rakesh
back to rne, God!

1379
01:45:58,089 --> 01:45:59,329
I love you, Rakesh.

1380
01:46:02,126 --> 01:46:03,104
Are you listening?

1381
01:46:04,462 --> 01:46:05,736
Please come back home.

1382
01:46:05,796 --> 01:46:06,536
Sulu..

1383
01:46:07,064 --> 01:46:08,634
Wherever you are,
please come home.

1384
01:46:10,634 --> 01:46:12,045
Come back.

1385
01:46:15,272 --> 01:46:16,717
I love you, Rakesh.

1386
01:46:16,774 --> 01:46:18,617
<i>Hove you, Sum.</i>

1387
01:46:20,778 --> 01:46:23,019
Yes, sir. He's been bailed.

1388
01:46:23,347 --> 01:46:25,657
I'll ask him to talk to you.
Hold on, sir.

1389
01:46:25,716 --> 01:46:28,424
Sir, phone.
It's Caesar sir's call, sir.

1390
01:46:33,824 --> 01:46:35,030
Aisha Verma.

1391
01:46:35,693 --> 01:46:39,470
Sai Kripa Society. Versova.

1392
01:46:40,831 --> 01:46:42,504
This was her address, right?

1393
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,373
When I learnt that she's pregnant...

1394
01:46:46,237 --> 01:46:47,716
...l was as happy as a person gets...

1395
01:46:48,038 --> 01:46:50,609
...on knowing about
a buy 1 get 1 free offer.

1396
01:46:51,142 --> 01:46:53,679
Buy a shampoo and
get a soap bar free.

1397
01:46:54,345 --> 01:46:57,622
Kill the mother and the son
or the daughter is killed for free.

1398
01:46:58,315 --> 01:46:59,988
I won't punish you now.

1399
01:47:00,251 --> 01:47:01,423
I'll kill you.

1400
01:47:01,485 --> 01:47:05,365
Sorry, but my life
was on a limited offer.

1401
01:47:06,123 --> 01:47:08,034
Till stocks last only.

1402
01:47:08,526 --> 01:47:10,437
You wanted to play with me.

1403
01:47:11,162 --> 01:47:16,441
But now you'll realise what a big
mistake you made by sparing my life.

1404
01:47:16,767 --> 01:47:21,307
You want to take my Sulo
and my son away from me, right?

1405
01:47:21,372 --> 01:47:25,343
Before that, I'll lake the
rest of your family away from you.

1406
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:29,580
You like to save people
from being killed by me, right?

1407
01:47:30,247 --> 01:47:31,590
To interfere.

1408
01:47:32,183 --> 01:47:34,060
But you have a strange talent.

1409
01:47:35,186 --> 01:47:36,665
You save the outsiders...

1410
01:47:37,755 --> 01:47:39,098
...but not your family.

1411
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:54,343
Send police to Aisha's
father's house immediately.

1412
01:47:54,405 --> 01:47:56,248
Rakesh has come to know who I am.

1413
01:47:56,307 --> 01:47:59,117
Save him. I'll do whatever you want.
Just save him.

1414
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:20,272
Tell me.

1415
01:48:24,635 --> 01:48:25,670
<i>S aw an“!</i>

1416
01:48:26,103 --> 01:48:27,776
Stop! Where are you going? Stop!

1417
01:48:27,838 --> 01:48:29,340
Where are you going?

1418
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,416
Stop! - Stop!

1419
01:48:32,476 --> 01:48:35,480
Hey! Leave him. Let him come.

1420
01:48:44,288 --> 01:48:45,096
Don't kill me.

1421
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:28,071
Sir, before Guru finds me
and kills me, I want to surrender.

1422
01:49:31,435 --> 01:49:32,573
Where are you right now?

1423
01:49:44,348 --> 01:49:46,760
I've seen many rogues
in my career as a policeman.

1424
01:49:47,084 --> 01:49:48,995
But I've never come
across such an insolent before.

1425
01:49:51,055 --> 01:49:52,534
If he gets away because of me...

1426
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:55,998
...then neither God, nor
I will be able to forgive myself.

1427
01:49:58,429 --> 01:50:00,204
I've always been
an obstacle for you.

1428
01:50:01,799 --> 01:50:03,608
I've been the villain of your life.

1429
01:50:05,302 --> 01:50:06,713
But I'm saying this to you today.

1430
01:50:07,771 --> 01:50:10,581
Go and kill him.

1431
01:50:12,743 --> 01:50:15,519
He's taking shelter in the
place where he committed the crime.

1432
01:50:17,114 --> 01:50:19,151
He's in Aisha and your house.

1433
01:50:32,296 --> 01:50:33,741
Aisha was wrong.

1434
01:50:39,503 --> 01:50:44,077
I fought death and
got life back for Aisha.

1435
01:50:44,742 --> 01:50:47,188
I got light back into my life.

1436
01:50:50,247 --> 01:50:54,286
But by killing her,
you've spread darkness again.

1437
01:50:58,455 --> 01:50:59,763
Aisha was wrong.

1438
01:51:01,458 --> 01:51:04,132
No lamp can bring
light into this darkness.

1439
01:51:04,194 --> 01:51:07,073
Only the fire of your
pyre can bring light back.

1440
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:11,775
Aisha was wrong.

1441
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,040
Aisha was wrong.

1442
01:51:16,306 --> 01:51:17,546
Aisha was wrong.

1443
01:51:25,149 --> 01:51:28,756
Please let rne go!
Please forgive rne! Please!

1444
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:31,230
Please forgive rne! Please!

1445
01:51:31,288 --> 01:51:34,565
Please forgive rne!
Please forgive rne!

1446
01:51:44,168 --> 01:51:47,581
This is what you
wanted to hear, right?

1447
01:51:47,638 --> 01:51:51,142
You wanted me to beg for my
life just as your Aisha did. Right?

1448
01:51:51,775 --> 01:51:54,221
I won't.

1449
01:51:54,812 --> 01:51:58,123
What did you think?
That you found me here?

1450
01:51:59,183 --> 01:51:59,661
No.

1451
01:51:59,717 --> 01:52:02,357
I brought you here.

1452
01:52:03,187 --> 01:52:04,996
I called that policeman.

1453
01:52:05,422 --> 01:52:09,529
I knew that you would get
furious on knowing my whereabouts.

1454
01:52:11,528 --> 01:52:14,407
The place where I killed your wife...

1455
01:52:15,499 --> 01:52:18,036
I knew you would come running to me.

1456
01:52:18,302 --> 01:52:21,181
I made you what I could never be.

1457
01:52:21,238 --> 01:52:22,717
Employee of the year.

1458
01:52:22,773 --> 01:52:24,081
MY Employee.

1459
01:52:27,144 --> 01:52:30,785
If the police had caught me,
I would go to prison.

1460
01:52:32,516 --> 01:52:34,325
All my crimes would be proved.

1461
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,099
My Sulo would have hated me.

1462
01:52:37,154 --> 01:52:40,363
The end of my love story
wouldn't have been a happy one.

1463
01:52:47,564 --> 01:52:49,202
Take this. Take it.

1464
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,305
Kill me.

1465
01:52:50,768 --> 01:52:52,111
You'll kill me...

1466
01:52:52,603 --> 01:52:57,313
...and I'll become
a hero for my Sulo.

1467
01:52:58,242 --> 01:52:59,243
Kill rne!

1468
01:53:01,078 --> 01:53:03,149
Please don't kill me!

1469
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:05,116
I want to live!

1470
01:53:05,582 --> 01:53:07,528
I'm pregnant!

1471
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:11,162
I want to give birth to my baby!

1472
01:53:11,755 --> 01:53:13,462
I'm pregnant!

1473
01:53:18,829 --> 01:53:19,671
Look at this.

1474
01:53:20,397 --> 01:53:24,345
You and I are like twin brothers
who were separated in childhood.

1475
01:53:24,768 --> 01:53:25,746
We're the same.

1476
01:53:26,303 --> 01:53:30,115
You want to kill me for your wife.

1477
01:53:30,174 --> 01:53:34,122
And I was killing
everyone for my wife.

1478
01:53:37,581 --> 01:53:42,121
You have no idea what
A big favour you've done on me.

1479
01:53:42,186 --> 01:53:43,688
Because of your revenge story...

1480
01:53:44,254 --> 01:53:49,067
...my Sulo said in front
of everyone that she loves me.

1481
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,537
Thank you, my friend.

1482
01:53:56,733 --> 01:53:58,713
Hello, Guru,
Sir wants to talk to you.

1483
01:54:01,638 --> 01:54:04,084
I threw your wife from here.

1484
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:05,142
Throw me down.

1485
01:54:05,542 --> 01:54:07,419
Avenge your wife's death.

1486
01:54:08,045 --> 01:54:11,083
Kill me. Let me win.

1487
01:54:11,148 --> 01:54:14,152
Let rne be the hero of
this story and be the villain!

1488
01:54:14,685 --> 01:54:15,629
<i>Rakes!“!</i>

1489
01:54:16,053 --> 01:54:17,054
My husband is not here.

1490
01:54:17,387 --> 01:54:19,389
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1491
01:54:19,456 --> 01:54:22,027
Mother! - Manish!
Where are you taking my son?

1492
01:54:22,092 --> 01:54:23,230
Mother!
- Leave him!

1493
01:54:23,293 --> 01:54:24,738
Mother!
- Manish!

1494
01:54:24,795 --> 01:54:25,432
Leave him.

1495
01:54:25,495 --> 01:54:26,701
Why are you doing this to us?

1496
01:54:27,264 --> 01:54:30,268
Please spare my son!
I beg of you!

1497
01:54:30,334 --> 01:54:31,039
Guru.

1498
01:54:32,236 --> 01:54:34,409
Rakesh killed your wife.

1499
01:54:35,172 --> 01:54:37,152
What have we done to you?
- I'll kill his wife.

1500
01:54:37,207 --> 01:54:39,687
Sulo! - Please spare my son!
For God's sake!

1501
01:54:39,743 --> 01:54:41,245
<i>Rakes!“ - Leave me.</i>

1502
01:54:45,148 --> 01:54:47,287
Please spare my son! For God's sake!

1503
01:54:47,351 --> 01:54:48,227
Spare my son.

1504
01:54:48,285 --> 01:54:50,231
Let go off her.

1505
01:54:50,287 --> 01:54:52,289
Sulol Sulol
- Rakesh.

1506
01:54:52,356 --> 01:54:56,361
Sulo! - Let her go.
- Help! Rakesh.

1507
01:54:56,426 --> 01:55:00,499
Sulo! Sulo! Sulo!
- Manish!

1508
01:55:01,098 --> 01:55:02,509
Sulol - Manish.

1509
01:55:02,566 --> 01:55:03,704
Spare my son.

1510
01:55:03,767 --> 01:55:05,212
Please spare him...

1511
01:55:05,269 --> 01:55:07,510
Manish - Spare him.

1512
01:55:07,571 --> 01:55:09,278
Please“ please spare him.

1513
01:55:09,339 --> 01:55:12,183
Rakesh! Rakesh! - Sulo!

1514
01:55:12,676 --> 01:55:14,178
Sulo! - Mummy!

1515
01:55:17,514 --> 01:55:18,584
<i>Sum...</i>

1516
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:21,761
<i>Sum...</i>

1517
01:55:24,521 --> 01:55:26,660
Now, it's his son's turn.

1518
01:55:27,357 --> 01:55:30,167
But you'll kill him. I won't.

1519
01:55:31,695 --> 01:55:35,507
I'm waiting for you
at RakesWs house, Guru.

1520
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,535
<i>Come. - sum.</i>

1521
01:55:38,068 --> 01:55:39,411
Come home, Guru.

1522
01:55:48,045 --> 01:55:52,118
You killed my Sulo.
You killed my Sulo!

1523
01:55:53,583 --> 01:55:59,556
You killed my Sulol
You killed Sulo.

1524
01:55:59,623 --> 01:56:01,967
You killed Sulo.

1525
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:14,280
You killed my Sulo!

1526
01:56:15,372 --> 01:56:17,113
On this road...

1527
01:56:19,142 --> 01:56:25,286
...this story began.

1528
01:56:28,452 --> 01:56:30,454
Your wife was right.

1529
01:56:31,221 --> 01:56:34,430
Someone would die over here someday.

1530
01:56:35,525 --> 01:56:37,061
On this road...

1531
01:56:37,127 --> 01:56:38,629
<i>...I'll</i> kill <i>you...</i>

1532
01:56:39,129 --> 01:56:44,408
...and bring an end...

1533
01:56:45,302 --> 01:56:48,977
...to this story.

1534
01:56:58,548 --> 01:56:59,993
Who did this?

1535
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:01,222
I. I didn't do it.

1536
01:57:01,284 --> 01:57:02,991
Can't you drive properly?

1537
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,694
There was a pothole.

1538
01:57:04,755 --> 01:57:06,029
Car lost its balance.

1539
01:57:06,623 --> 01:57:08,432
What happened?

1540
01:57:08,492 --> 01:57:10,733
He is dead.

1541
01:57:33,683 --> 01:57:35,253
'Darkness cannot
drive out darkness.'

1542
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,024
'Only light can do that.'

1543
01:57:42,192 --> 01:57:43,569
'Hate cannot drive out hate.'

1544
01:57:44,494 --> 01:57:45,996
'Only love can do that.'

1545
01:57:49,699 --> 01:57:52,612
'That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...'

1546
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:55,015
'...is still over there.'

1547
01:58:01,445 --> 01:58:03,482
'He only needs someone's hand.'

1548
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:07,793
'Someone-'s support.'

1549
01:58:14,124 --> 01:58:17,401
'Someone who can pull him out of the
darkness and bring him to light.'

1550
01:58:26,269 --> 01:58:28,715
'Unless we share
someone else's pain...'

1551
01:58:29,539 --> 01:58:33,715
'...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.'

1552
01:59:32,335 --> 01:59:33,678
Do you want to hear a joke?

1553
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:37,684
Once, there was a beggar.

1554
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:40,121
He called up in the five star hotel“

1555
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,545
“and ordered for a burger..

1556
01:59:42,112 --> 01:59:44,615
“pizza and sweet dish.

1557
01:59:45,549 --> 01:59:46,619
Waiter asked him...

1558
01:59:46,683 --> 01:59:47,718
..in whose name
the order shall be placed?

1559
01:59:48,251 --> 01:59:49,423
Beggar said“

1560
01:59:49,753 --> 01:59:50,993
..give it in the name of God.

1561
02:00:05,101 --> 02:00:09,106
"This is where nightfall happens."

1562
02:00:10,407 --> 02:00:15,550
"This is where it's dawn."

1563
02:00:15,845 --> 02:00:20,794
"This is where I
have to live and die."

1564
02:00:21,284 --> 02:00:26,495
"This is where I find spirituality."

1565
02:00:27,724 --> 02:00:30,432
"Your home."

1566
02:00:30,493 --> 02:00:32,439

"You cry over my tears."

1573
02:01:11,568 --> 02:01:16,517
"Someone whispers in my thoughts."

1574
02:01:17,207 --> 02:01:21,781
"l feel your presence
even when you're not around."

1575
02:01:21,845 --> 02:01:26,845
"You are the cure to my pain."

1576
02:01:38,495 --> 02:01:43,535
"You're in my prayers."

1577

"Your home."

"What kind of a
relationship do we share?"

1584
02:02:33,083 --> 02:02:37,554
"It has no name,
but it's still so deep."

1585
02:02:38,521 --> 02:02:43,334
"These moments are priceless."

1586
02:02:44,027 --> 02:02:48,703
"We might lose them."

1587
02:02:48,765 --> 02:02:53,765
"Let this moment come to a halt."

1588
02:03:05,348 --> 02:03:10,297
