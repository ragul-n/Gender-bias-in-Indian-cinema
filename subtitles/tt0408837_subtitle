1
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,991
Our men found this
carpet on the creek.

2
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,995
We have a boat here. It
seems there's a corpse in it.

3
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,331
That's why we called the police.

4
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,462
We came here because
we received the call.

5
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,670
Hasan, carpet!

6
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:45,089
Ajay Rastogi!
He was missing. He's dead.

7
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,765
Lover boy! Majnu!

8
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:02,373
Rashid, yes. Send
an ambulance here.

9
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,045
There's a dead body, we've
to send it for post mortem.

10
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,379
Greetings!

11
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:16,394
After the post mortem, Hasan.
It's a lover's funeral procession.

12
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,730
It should be grand.
Don't worry, now...

13
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,297
...your murderer
would be in my grip.

14
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,164
Hello, madam!
- Yes? - Greetings, madam.

15
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,469
It's that we were
following you. - No, Hasan.

16
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,478
We weren't following her.
I saw her, here.

17
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,741
So, I thought of
talking to her. - Is that so?

18
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,076
You told me that we
were following her.

19
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,676
No! We don't follow girls,
Hasan. - Ok.

20
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,355
Anyway, why had you come here?

21
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,224
I had come here to give
my clothes in the laundry.

22
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,492
Very good. We should
wash our dirty clothes.

23
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,626
But, is there any stain?
- That of blood.

24
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:02,033
Hasan, it's wrong to talk
like this before proving the crime.

25
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,838
God won't forgive you.
Prove the crime, first.

26
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,775
And then you can say
whatever you want to.

27
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,438
Madam is with us.
Isn't it so, madam?

28
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,449
We found this envelope
from your coat pocket.

29
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,691
That photo is good. Let
me see, which one is that?

30
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,799
But, madam, why did
your face turn pale?

31
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,136
Then come, sit in our car.
- We'll drop you home.

32
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,138
We'll drop you
till your doorstep.

33
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,731
With this excuse, we'll once
again, have a look at your house.

34
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,610
Anyway, had Ajay ever
come to your house?

35
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,975
What kind of a question is this?

36
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,541
He wants to prove that you
had some relation with that boy.

37
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,416
Did you have any?
- Forget it, sir.

38
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,615
Why to ask all that here?
She isn't well, too.

39
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,148
Let's go to her house and talk.
- C'mon. C'mon, madam.

40
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,703
We've found Ajay
Rastogi's dead body.

41
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,643
We wanted to give you
this news at your house.

42
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,678
So that, if you needed support,
then you could use the walls.

43
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,513
And if you want, you
can sit as well. Please sit.

44
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,352
I'm absolutely fine. - Just
now, you weren't feeling well.

45
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,264
Moreover, did your boyfriend's
death come as a shock to you?

46
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:42,941
I love my husband. - Then
what were you doing with that Ajay?

47
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:52,140
Meeting? Or nights?
- Then prove it. Prove it!

48
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,379
Ok. Then, let's
start with your bag.

49
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,224
It's said that a woman's
world is hidden in her bag.

50
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,230
Then, maybe we would find a proof
of your relation with Ajay, here.

51
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,964
Bag?
- Bag?

52
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,405
Thank you.

53
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,086
Dear, they're checking my bag.

54
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,759
What? - Come. We'll
check the house as well.

55
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,531
Because, we've
found Ajay's dead body.

56
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,105
But, do you have any warrant?

57
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,007
Are you teaching us about
the law? - I'm telling you.

58
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:58,110
Ok. Then, I'll come prepared.
No criminal has...

59
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,621
...been able to
escape Rashid's hands.

60
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,779
Have you seen these arms?

61
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,857
Sir, think of you to be ruined.

62
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,465
When Rashid sir,
talks in English...

63
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,562
...then no one will be
able to save you. Goodbye!

64
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:56,669
I'm divorcing you.
Don't be so gloomy.

65
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:03,179
The police on one side, and
our personal life on the other.

66
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,842
What's happened
to our personal life?

67
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,084
Before doing all this,
didn't you even think...

68
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,522
...how would I feel when I
come to know of all this?

69
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:23,831
Be where you are. No one,
ever, has seen my tears.

70
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,704
Nor will anyone see.

71
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:38,648
It was my mistake.
- Now, everything over here.

72
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,551
The road to this place,
and this house, remind me of...

73
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,385
...the stain of betrayal,
and the past moments.

74
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,853
I'm buying 2 tickets.
Tomorrow itself.

75
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,887
We'll be going back to
India within the next 2 days.

76
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,629
No, don't buy
any tickets for me.

77
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,794
The police is
already doubting us.

78
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:03,072
If we buy two tickets, then they'll
feel that we're trying to flee.

79
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:11,244
They can arrest us anytime. I'll
come there, somehow within 15 days.

80
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:17,919
And yes, don't tell anyone in
the office that you're resigning.

81
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:23,157
Send them your resignation
letter, as soon as you reach India.

82
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,594
I'm so, sorry, your career...

83
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,509
Sapna and Raj. There relation,
today, has...

84
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,453
...reached the
verge of a divorce.

85
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:56,292
Once, it was a happy relation.
This story is of lust and love.

86
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:01,195
The battle of these two senses.
And it starts from here.

87
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:28,282
What are you doing?
- Ok. Then recite poetry.

88
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,083
Poetry? No.
- Then I won't get up.

89
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,630
Your gaze has stolen the
peace and tranquility of my heart.

90
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,433
I don't remember the next line.
- I look at you, think of you...

91
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,835
...desire for you,
again and again.

92
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,637
This is the one.
- After all he's a husband.

93
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:58,176
Meet him, he's Hameed. - I
know, he works in your office.

94
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,816
Even I used to
think that I knew him.

95
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,050
Why? Did you come to know
of any secret of his, today?

96
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,059
He's been going around with
someone else for the past 6 months.

97
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,089
His wife feels that he's
working overtime in the office.

98
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,921
Forget it, pal.
Order something to eat.

99
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,858
Raj, order something
vegetarian for her.

100
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,165
It's said that a lion may starve
to death, but won't eat grass.

101
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,537
I'm not a lion, pal.
- He keeps 2 women, satisfied.

102
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,102
Yet, he says
that he isn't a lion.

103
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,449
Where are you going?
- I'm getting bored.

104
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,615
Come, I'll introduce
you to my 2nd lion.

105
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:43,957
Lion, Sharin. He's not only
a lion, but a ferocious one.

106
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,691
Raj, now don't tease me.
- His lion-heartedness, has...

107
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,961
...been going on
for the past 2 years.

108
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,797
But, there's no way that his wife's
suspicion would ever be aroused.

109
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,377
Dear, I'm not a lion.

110
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,976
You're lucky, your
husband brings you to the disco.

111
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,645
He didn't bring me, I compelled
him to take me along.

112
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:17,547
'Your gaze has robbed the
peace and tranquility of my heart.'

113
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:36,735
'I look at you, think of you
desire for you, again and again.'

114
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:25,619
'Ln a slow heat, this heart
began to burn, what to do? '

115
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:34,790
'A slight smoke arouse
from my breath, what to do? '

116
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:44,636
I, too, understood,
why this restlessness is.'

117
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:54,316
'Come, I'll douse these sparks,
with dewdrops.'

118
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:03,990
'I'll be thankful
to you, all my life.'

119
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:16,961
'Ln my heart, now,
dear. There's anxiety.'

120
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:26,073
'I've, slowly, started
losing my peace of mind.'

121
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:36,184
'This anxiety says that we
should continue loving each other.'

122
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:45,921
'You remain crazy about me.
I'll remain crazy about you.'

123
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:55,336
'Maybe, it'll
never reduce, our love.'

124
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:09,337
Are you alright?
Come over to this side.

125
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,347
This driver must
surely be a Pakistani.

126
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:17,148
Else, everyone surely
stops on seeing a pedestrian.

127
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,487
You're bleeding.
- It's alright.

128
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,197
It's difficult to
get a taxi in this area.

129
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:30,099
I stay nearby, let's go
to my house and get the...

130
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,297
...wound treated,
lest it gets septic.

131
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,532
No, I'll go home and...

132
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,038
You'll be able to go home,
only when you get a taxi.

133
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:46,381
Come home. Get the wound treated,
by then, I'll get you a taxi.

134
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,713
And lunch hour,
too, would get over.

135
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,713
Come in.

136
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,243
This is my house. I'm a painter.

137
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,612
Don't feel shy, what's
wrong in looking at a body.

138
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:26,581
You sit, I'll get Dettol.
You're still bleeding.

139
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,917
Of course you'll. You
haven't applied Dettol, yet.

140
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:40,438
Sit. I'm a bachelor.
That's why these clothes...

141
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,813
I'll apply it myself. - No!
No one applies Dettol on them...

142
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,285
...properly, because it burns.

143
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,291
A wound gets cured
only when it burns.

144
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,958
There's a lot of
innocence on your face.

145
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm looking at in from
a painter's point of view.

146
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,980
Sit. I'll put a band-aid on it.
- No. I'll do it, myself.

147
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,307
What's the use if a
person treats his own wound?

148
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,319
What's the use if
one lives all alone?

149
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,889
It's a good poetry. But,
I've band-aid at my house.

150
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,084
Then, your coming
here has been a waste.

151
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,627
There is band-aid at your house.

152
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,892
But, there isn't any Dettol.

153
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,010
This moment is life, if you want
to live, then, live this moment.

154
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,081
It's written in this book.
I've read it a lot of times.

155
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,345
These are ideas about how to
live. On reading it, I feel...

156
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,017
...everyone should read
this book, at least once.

157
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:15,032
A small gift from me, to you.
- No... me...

158
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,037
Looking at your eyes, I feel,
you want to learn to live.

159
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,541
You feel that you can
read my eyes? - Absolutely.

160
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,375
Don't believe, so much,
in yourself.

161
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,381
You'll be cheated. - There
isn't a word, such as cheating...

162
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,222
...in my dictionary. Neither do
I promise anybody, and break it.

163
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,552
Nor do I make anyone promise,
and be cheated.

164
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,960
I shall take leave. - Ok. If
you're passing by, next time...

165
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:14,590
You!? You're at home, so early?

166
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:22,256
Where had you been?
You wives are lucky.

167
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:28,432
Go for shopping, roam around.
- You don't let me work.

168
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,440
Why do you need to work,
your highness?

169
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,346
I'm there for that. I toil day
and night, so that, we shift to...

170
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,284
...America, from Dubai.
Where, we'll have our own empire.

171
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:46,516
The company's flat,
cars and millions of dollars.

172
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,458
Why's America so
close to your heart?

173
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:59,366
Raj, we can go to India
and start our own business...

174
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,635
...as well, isn't it? - After staying
in Dubai, you want to go to India?

175
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,475
How did this happen?
- I fell down.

176
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:16,311
Did you get hurt? - I did.
But then, I found a good man.

177
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,822
His house was nearby. He
took me home and applied Dettol.

178
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,487
Who was that good man?

179
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,492
Feeling shy? - You don't
feel shy talking like this.

180
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:36,167
Darling, my name isn't Raj
Sharma(shy), it's Raj Mittal.

181
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,334
The jokes of us,
husband's are always sick.

182
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,071
And what about the wife's love?

183
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:50,747
That's always great. - You're saying
this by looking at your laptop?

184
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,182
Darling, try to
understand my work pressure.

185
00:24:53,525 --> 00:25:00,021
My boss is a British.
- And my love is Indian.

186
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,693
What's the matter? You seem to
be in a different mood, tonight.

187
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,471
After that, I've
to go to the site.

188
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,459
You've eaten your food,
now, go to the site.

189
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,127
What's this? - I had forgotten to
tell you, I had ordered this camera.

190
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,897
And it has been delivered,
only today.

191
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,590
You join me, too.

192
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,766
I'll shoot, now. You dance.

193
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,310
Ok. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

194
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,477
Where are you going?

195
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,586
Should I call him up or not?

196
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,706
I'm Sapna speaking.
- Sapna?

197
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:51,315
I had met you, accident
on the road, and Dettol.

198
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,328
I had called you up...

199
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,499
Come over, let's have a
cup of coffee, together.

200
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,171
No!
- Where are you? - City center.

201
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,775
It isn't far from my house.

202
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,730
What's this? A bag on your
shoulder, one in your hands.

203
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,745
Shall I tell you how
I made this painting?

204
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,753
I heard poetry. I meet you
such that, I become your attire.

205
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:34,155
You become an ocean,
and I shall become a thirst.

206
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,919
And that's how I made
this beautiful painting.

207
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:49,768
It's so hot, today. It's
the month of November. Yet...

208
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,767
It seems, my AC isn't
working properly.

209
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:07,451
I had given you a book, last
time. Did you read it? - No.

210
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,459
That's why your eyes are
still searching. - What?

211
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,588
Searching for life. Come,
I'll show you a glimpse of life.

212
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:23,963
No, why?

213
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,824
What's this?
- Look, how colorful life is.

214
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,486
Your eyes are
searching for this, only.

215
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,496
But, will they get washed off?
- Life hasn't become colorful, yet.

216
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,504
And you're already
thinking of washing it off?

217
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,497
But, I can't go home like this.

218
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,023
Has the color been
washed off your hands?

219
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:27,134
It seems you've to go, now.
- I was about to go.

220
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,934
Actually, I've to
go out somewhere.

221
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,872
And I knew that
you were about to go.

222
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,203
Then what was
the need to say so?

223
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,212
Before you could say, I said so.

224
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,551
There's no reason
for me to wait here.

225
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,812
There wasn't any reason
for coming here, either.

226
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,550
I just wanted to
thank you for that day.

227
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,884
If you want to meet again,
you can make up another excuse.

228
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,055
I don't have the habit
of making up excuses.

229
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,191
You'll learn.
- There's no need for that.

230
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,566
Whenever you'll smile, you'll
be reminded of my colors.

231
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,833
That's it. Enough. I don't
want to argue with you.

232
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:10,070
Do you want to hug me? - I had
thought of you, to be a gentleman.

233
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,746
Had I been a gentleman, you wouldn't
have come to meet me, again.

234
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,912
Now, I've come to
know your real character.

235
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,983
Fine. Then you'll come here,
frequently. - Never.

236
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,927
Those who run from themselves,
they usually...

237
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:33,266
...come into my arms.
She, too, will come.

238
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,941
How come you're here?
Today, so suddenly?

239
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,954
Yes. What else can I do? You
bring your office work, home.

240
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,287
So, I thought of bringing
our home to your office, today.

241
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,623
Come over here.
- Sit.

242
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,288
Of course I'll sit.
This is my office, after all.

243
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,097
What have you brought for me?

244
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:08,264
Can't you see, it's a shirt?
I just wanted to...

245
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,365
...see whether
it fits you or not.

246
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,111
Come on. Wear it and show.

247
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:21,173
Wear it and show, please. Then,
we can go out, together, for lunch.

248
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,050
Lunch? What made you think of
having lunch, together, today?

249
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,317
At least, I could
spend sometime with you.

250
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,984
Ok. Then, what'll
you like to eat?

251
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,652
Shall we go to eat Chinese?

252
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,133
Sorry, I didn't know
that Mrs. Mittal is here.

253
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,001
It's alright, Amit. Tell me.
- Sir, I forgot to tell you that...

254
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,337
...you have a meeting
with Mr. Johnson at 1.30pm.

255
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,008
You forgot to tell me about
a meeting with Mr. Johnson!?

256
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,180
Sorry, darling, I need to go.

257
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,013
Then, what about lunch?
- We can have lunch, anytime.

258
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,349
But, Mr. Johnson is my boss.

259
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,183
You take a cab and go home.

260
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,706
What were you thinking about,
dear? - No. Nothing.

261
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,713
You were surely
lost somewhere, that...

262
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,976
...you couldn't hear
my footsteps. - No!

263
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,711
Are you attracted to someone?

264
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,724
I'll get the dinner
ready in 15 minutes.

265
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,266
Isn't it a coincidence that
we're shopping in the same mall?

266
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,074
This can't be a coincidence.
- Since I've been...

267
00:36:56,147 --> 00:37:00,083
...caught, let me tell you the
truth. I've been going around...

268
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:04,383
...this mall, 5 times in
the last 5 days. - Why?

269
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,754
Last time, you had called me
up from this mall, that's why.

270
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,084
That doesn't mean that I should
come to this mall, only.

271
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,926
I've gone to 5-6
other malls, as well.

272
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,330
Do I go around shopping
in the malls, all day?

273
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,766
Those, whose husbands are rich,
and don't let them work.

274
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,461
They do nothing, but
shop around in malls.

275
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:26,236
Look, I don't want to...
- Argue with you. I know.

276
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:41,784
Sorry, for what? - I misbehaved
with you, last time.

277
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,798
You should come home
with me, at least once.

278
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,125
No way.
- At least for a coffee.

279
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:07,508
You look too innocent,
but you're really cunning.

280
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,919
Cunning? - Look, the
coffee is getting cold.

281
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,820
Coffee is getting cold?

282
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,449
I used to come to the malls everyday,
after making coffee for you.

283
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,155
Come on, please.

284
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,169
One day, I'll surely
make a painting of yours.

285
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:35,305
Your eyes are so beautiful.
Don't run away. I'm coming.

286
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,941
Why? - You ran away, last time.
- You drove me away.

287
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:50,654
What? - Eyes. Are you feeling
bad, because I'm praising you?

288
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,864
Can a girl feel bad
if someone praises her?

289
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,660
Shall I praise you more? - No.
This is enough for me, today.

290
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,870
It seems, you don't
have an admirer. - Why?

291
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,006
You are satisfied with,
just, this much.

292
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,605
Come, I'll show
you around my house.

293
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,203
You've only seen my
drawing room, and washroom.

294
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:32,634
Come. I'm sorry, we
came back. It's here.

295
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,956
This apartment isn't mine.
It's my friend's.

296
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,923
He went to Egypt, and
gave it to me, for staying.

297
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,254
This is a bedroom,
washroom, where you had...

298
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,926
...gone to wash
your colorful life.

299
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,305
This is the maid's room.
But, there isn't any maid.

300
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,003
This is my master bedroom.

301
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:49,703
' In your love, I've begun to perish.
I've began to cross every limit.'

302
00:41:49,773 --> 00:42:00,377
'Sometimes, I've begun
to live, sometimes, die.'

303
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,633
You!?

304
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,681
I was tired of
working in the office.

305
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,960
I was thinking of you,
I don't give you time.

306
00:43:54,665 --> 00:44:05,667
I do the wrong thing.
But now, I'll try my best.

307
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:12,873
I can't promise. Do you love me?

308
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:18,447
What kind of a question
is this? - Tell me. - Yes.

309
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:25,189
Come, I shall take you out for
dinner, today. - Some other time.

310
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:43,694
There's so much
attraction in your eyes.

311
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:49,603
I've become excited
on seeing you.

312
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:12,852
' Don't know what anxiety
is there in my heart... '

313
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:18,766
'... that I've started
melting in your arms.'

314
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:26,368
'Sometimes I burn,
sometimes I get doused.'

315
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:22,761
' Lonely evenings,
lonely mornings.'

316
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:28,965
' I've started getting
afraid of loneliness.'

317
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:52,793
'Sometimes I feel I've
started going astray.'

318
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:58,130
'Sometimes I feel I've
started getting scattered.'

319
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:12,980
'Since I've stated meeting you,
I've begun crossing all limits.'

320
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:16,535
There was a time when your
legs wouldn't go out of the house.

321
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,739
Nowadays, it doesn't
stay within the house.

322
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,566
What are you doing at home?

323
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:43,228
No. I can't come to meet you.

324
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,909
Please try to understand. - I'm
not going to try to do anything.

325
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:53,780
1.30, I'll be waiting at
Marbella club for you. - But...

326
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,593
Today, can I go out?
- What's there to ask in that?

327
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:15,131
No, then you shouldn't shoot
dialogues when I return.

328
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,798
No. You can go.
- But, come back soon.

329
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:40,885
No one will see.

330
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,967
Your husband isn't here.

331
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,997
Hameed, Mr. Johnson
hasn't come, yet.

332
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:29,809
He's never late for
his lunch appointment.

333
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:35,242
What happened, Hameed? In
whose thoughts are you lost?

334
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,980
Sir, I want to tell
you something. - What?

335
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:43,283
Sir, you please pay
attention towards your home.

336
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,154
You usually go home, very late.

337
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,288
What's there to pay attention,
at home, Hameed?

338
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,792
Work! As long as your work is
going on fine, everything's fine.

339
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,479
I'm coming, too.

340
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,103
The water's too cold.

341
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,288
The water's hot,
and she's feeling cold?

342
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:46,479
Nowadays, you
dress too selectively.

343
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:51,151
It's for your sake.
- For me? That too, during...

344
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,052
...the day, when I'm not at home.

345
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,560
Your started wearing makeup,
that too, during the day.

346
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,296
You've started commenting
a lot, these days.

347
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:11,329
Forget it. - No. I've an appointment
in the beauty salon, today.

348
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:16,305
At 12.30. - That means you'll have
your lunch with the beauticians.

349
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,374
Yes, just sandwich.

350
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:27,919
What's your beauty
salon's name? - Noor.

351
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:50,536
Mariam, find out about Noor
beauty salon, and give me a call.

352
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,204
I'm on the hold.

353
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,221
Sir, that beauty
salon's phone is ringing.

354
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:07,390
Noor salon.
- Yes, this is Raj Mittal, here.

355
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:15,102
Does Mrs. Mittal have an
appointment at 12.30, today?

356
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,469
No, sir. She doesn't
have any appointment, today.

357
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,704
Ok. She must've forgotten
to take an appointment.

358
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,253
How are you? Where
were you these days?

359
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,265
No phone call,
neither any meetings.

360
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,393
Neither that dancing.
Where are you going?

361
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,596
Have you become too busy?
- No, pals.

362
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,366
Just came for
some window shopping.

363
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,135
Window shopping, that too, here?

364
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,472
There are only
electronic shops here!

365
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,478
Since when did you get
interested in electronic goods?

366
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:00,141
No, pal. Just that...
- Anyway, forget it.

367
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:03,185
Come, let's go and have some
coffee. - No. That... - C'mon.

368
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,955
I'll be coming a little late.
I met some friends.

369
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,963
Where are you? - That coffee shop,
where we went that day, over there.

370
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,966
Near your house.
- Then, bring your friends, too.

371
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,317
Whom were you talking to?
- It seems you had

372
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,649
,, an appointment with someone.

373
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,321
We girls should get into one
or two affairs, after marriage.

374
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,325
Because after a few
years of marriage...

375
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,987
...our husbands
lose interest in us.

376
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,131
You don't get anything
other than pain, in that affair.

377
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,633
Why? Has anything
similar happened to you?

378
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:57,329
Yes, it has. We're all
together. C'mon, tell her.

379
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,334
What do I tell you,
pal? There was someone...

380
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,074
...like an intoxication
of a few months.

381
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,116
Then, the same pain.
- Where's he, now?

382
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,411
He got married
and went to Germany.

383
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,589
He must be happy with his wife.

384
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:20,219
Forget it. Let's talk
about something else.

385
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,824
But, our heart is crazy. It
wants to fall in love again.

386
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,692
Especially when a
boy is like that stud.

387
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,372
I'll be back from the washroom.

388
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:08,366
Someone might come.
- It has its own fun.

389
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:49,183
Where were you all this while? - 
Have you started timing this, too?

390
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:55,622
I feel, you were with that stud.
- Which stud? - The one behind you.

391
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,461
Life can be exciting if
there's a stud like this, with you.

392
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,469
Exciting but dangerous.

393
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:18,811
That was fun, lust! Hawas (lust).

394
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:26,154
What's the matter?
- Is this too written in my eyes?

395
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,485
This is written
from your head to toe.

396
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:34,656
Do you know, when I do not
meet you, I remain very restless.

397
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:40,635
And when you meet me?
- That day, I hate myself.

398
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,175
Finish this relationship.

399
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:54,908
Yeah, you are right.
Perhaps that will give me peace.

400
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,525
Don't dare speak a
single word against him.

401
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,541
How come the contract
went out of our hands?

402
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,551
If Mr. Johnson asks, it will
be I who will have to answer.

403
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,553
Sir, I thought the tender
date to be 26th of January...

404
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,714
...but it turned out to be 24th.

405
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,233
A person who is reckless
about his duties is of no use to us.

406
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,896
Sir, you are sacking me!?
- Yes.

407
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,736
I will get your visa cancelled
and you will be required...

408
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,970
...to go back to Pakistan again.

409
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,245
Sir, please, consider
about my wife and children.

410
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,577
You should have thought of
this before being reckless.

411
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,583
Sir, my son studies in school.

412
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,744
He will not get admission in
any school in Pakistan, in January.

413
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:08,584
I cannot take your blame on my head.

414
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,252
Sir, please, think at
least about my family.

415
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,594
What will you
consider about my family?

416
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,636
You cannot keep your
own family under control.

417
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,864
Go and see for yourself,
about your wife's whereabouts...

418
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,933
...during the daytime.
- I will pull your tongue out.

419
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,880
Pulling out the tongue
doesn't change the truth, sir.

420
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,355
You called me.

421
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,363
Yeah, very punctual!

422
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:59,363
Yes, the British taught so.

423
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,799
I want you to go behind someone.

424
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,361
Will you be able to do it?

425
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,371
Right now, I am standing
behind you only, sir.

426
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:12,710
That is my job! Will you continue
to stand like this or further...

427
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:17,378
Wanted to see my face, right?
Saw it?

428
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:23,823
Whom do you want
me to shadow upon?

429
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:41,576
Name? - This isn't
necessary for you to know.

430
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,907
Address?
- That I am going to tell you.

431
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,742
What does she do,
whom all she meets...

432
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,808
...and where all she goes...

433
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,218
...I want all the photographs.

434
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:56,418
It will require a shadowing
for at least 8-10 days.

435
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,157
It will cost you
around 2000 Dirhams.

436
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,422
I don't care for the cost.

437
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,894
Because personal life
and happiness are priceless.

438
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:11,762
Her address!

439
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,839
You aren't eating properly.

440
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,815
Hunger seems to have died.

441
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:28,883
Why? What happened?
- Worries for you.

442
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,791
For me? - Yes, what all
you do during the day...

443
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:35,820
...where all you go.

444
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,799
Why are you asking this?
- You are my wife, after all.

445
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,802
This makes me worry about you.

446
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:45,466
What can I do,
after all? Yesterday...

447
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,977
...went out for coffee
with Rita and Ramola.

448
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,476
Or I go out shopping.

449
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:55,814
Really?

450
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,816
I am going out for
3 days on business.

451
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:05,484
All of a sudden?
- I have sacked Hameed.

452
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:09,828
That's why you are so worried.

453
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,494
Lost my faith on him.

454
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,234
Actually, I have
lost faith on everyone.

455
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,855
If you are awake,
then listen to this.

456
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,625
I will reach the airport
at 5.30 a.m. On the 4th.

457
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:46,866
If possible, pick me up.

458
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,924
What's the matter?
You look very happy today.

459
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:48,260
You haven't read my eyes, as yet.

460
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:53,700
If not the eyes, the
breaths narrate it, baby!

461
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:06,104
Let's us go out somewhere.

462
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:10,214
Seem to be in a
holiday mood, today. - Yes.

463
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:14,950
A holiday of 3 days.
- 3 days? What does that mean?

464
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:22,954
Not you but I will ask the
question, today. - Go ahead.

465
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,795
Do you love me?

466
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:31,704
I do know how to make love,
but do not know to fall in love.

467
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:40,142
My heart holds so much
love but none to value it.

468
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,979
Come, let us hear
of your heart today.

469
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:48,012
What you feel and
wish to express in love!

470
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:25,017
'I would like to
meet you in such a way... '

471
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:29,690
'... that I become your attire.'

472
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:49,049
'Turning you into an
ocean let me become thirst.'

473
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:21,804
'Let me spread
myself in your embrace.'

474
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:31,809
'Let me immerse myself in
the depths of your heart.'

475
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:42,160
'Ln this atmosphere,
I can see only this.'

476
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:52,170
'Love is a storm, sweetheart
and you are the wave.'

477
01:11:53,008 --> 01:12:02,178
'You are my shore of love on
which I break myself everyday.'

478
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,167
Dilawar speaking, sir.
- Yes Dilawar, speak.

479
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,234
Sir they have gone to Kurfa Khan.
- Even I am there.

480
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:07,407
They are staying in Hotel Oceanic.
- Hotel Oceanic?

481
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:10,574
Room number?
- 412.

482
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:42,283
Why are you bothering me?
- You?

483
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:45,286
I've checked in today.
What is your problem?

484
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,288
Want to break the door?
What do you want?

485
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:56,124
That's it. Enough. I have
understood the meaning of love.

486
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:57,961
Really?

487
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,301
I've worn your
attire, haven't I?

488
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,303
You will never understand
the meaning of love.

489
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:11,979
Let go of me! I have to go.

490
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,380
Where? - Raj is arriving. I've to go
to pick him up at the airport. Let go.

491
01:14:56,525 --> 01:15:00,689
How are you?
- Alive. How are you?

492
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,761
I am okay.
- Were you in Dubai itself?

493
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,529
Yes, what makes you ask that?

494
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,366
What if I prove something else?

495
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:15,036
What are you saying? - Now I
will talk with evidences alongside.

496
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,035
What has happened to you?
- I feel like a volcano.

497
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:24,211
The day it erupts, don't know
whom all the suppressed lava...

498
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,379
...will burn to ashes. Even
I cannot assume how many.

499
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,384
Just waiting for the time.

500
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,710
Take a U turn.
- What, madam?

501
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,440
I say, take a U turn.
- Yes, madam.

502
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:58,237
Where must he have gone?

503
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:01,536
' I have given my heart to you!
You have given your heart to me! '

504
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,205
'Just don't know what
magic has happened, O'dear! '

505
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:25,556
'You have gone crazy!
I have gone lovelorn.'

506
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:29,229
'The heart has
become restless, O'dear! '

507
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:05,771
' People continued to say
that love is a punishment... '

508
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,777
'... but they do not know
how much fun is there in it.'

509
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:21,620
'You become my life,
I become yours! '

510
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:25,285
'This is the promise
we have made, O'dear! '

511
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:33,692
'Your gaze touched me and a
fire erupted in this body.'

512
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,696
' May I continue to burn
like this only, is the...

513
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,698
...desire that has arisen in me.'

514
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:49,867
'Our thirst is similar... '

515
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:53,711
'... this heart is thirsty, O'dear! '

516
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:22,801
How many girlfriends
do you have? How many?

517
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,472
I am not your husband that you
are asking such questions to me.

518
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:31,808
I had told you, neither do I
give my words nor do I betray.

519
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,876
It was a mistake to meet you.

520
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:40,888
Everything with you was a mistake.

521
01:23:58,963 --> 01:24:01,295
My name's Raj Mittal.

522
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:04,057
Sapna's my wife.

523
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:07,234
Come in.

524
01:24:11,476 --> 01:24:13,239
Please sit. What
would you like to drink?

525
01:24:15,413 --> 01:24:17,244
What if I say, your blood, then?

526
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,915
Then, I'll say that
you've a good sense of humor.

527
01:24:22,987 --> 01:24:25,353
This joke can cost you highly.

528
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:30,118
I don't care about the cost. This
life is nothing but a joke to me.

529
01:24:34,599 --> 01:24:37,432
Look, I know that
Sapna is your wife.

530
01:24:37,502 --> 01:24:41,268
But, I didn't compel
her to do anything.

531
01:24:41,339 --> 01:24:44,001
Whatever I did, I did
according to her wishes.

532
01:24:46,444 --> 01:24:48,674
There's nothing right
or wrong in this world.

533
01:24:49,013 --> 01:24:51,948
I'm a hero, not a villain.

534
01:24:59,624 --> 01:25:03,116
There must be
something lacking in you.

535
01:25:03,461 --> 01:25:06,453
That's why she came in to my arms.

536
01:25:07,298 --> 01:25:09,459
Moreover, whomever I want to
take in my arms, I do get her.

537
01:25:10,468 --> 01:25:12,629
I didn't even need to try.

538
01:25:16,307 --> 01:25:19,640
The iron was hot, I just
needed to strike at it.

539
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:24,979
I'm a frank kind of
a person, Mr. Mittal.

540
01:25:26,151 --> 01:25:27,982
Your marriage is over.

541
01:25:30,488 --> 01:25:35,482
Because I'm an expert in marriages.

542
01:25:37,662 --> 01:25:39,653
As, I, never married.

543
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:44,660
By getting married, do you assume
that the girl is your property?

544
01:25:46,504 --> 01:25:48,335
Wrong. Totally wrong.

545
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:52,332
I don't believe in the rules of
the society and that of the world.

546
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,513
I'm a free minded painter.

547
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:19,364
If you've come here, to
tell me to leave Sapna.

548
01:26:19,437 --> 01:26:21,530
Then, I'll tell you that
I've already left her.

549
01:26:21,606 --> 01:26:24,040
I'm with someone else. Shakira!

550
01:26:45,563 --> 01:26:47,394
Sapna has gifted this to me.

551
01:26:57,742 --> 01:26:59,073
Women give me a lot of gifts.

552
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:03,073
As I make them happy.

553
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,378
Moreover, you haven't
done anything good with her.

554
01:27:09,754 --> 01:27:11,722
She wanted to shower
you with a lot of love.

555
01:27:12,757 --> 01:27:14,088
But, you didn't have time for her.

556
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:23,560
But, I don't need her, or
anyone else's love, in life.

557
01:27:24,602 --> 01:27:29,630
My main business in
life is lust. Lust!

558
01:27:30,174 --> 01:27:33,109
Life isn't about love, but lust!

559
01:27:33,444 --> 01:27:36,845
That's what I aroused in Sapna.

560
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:58,544
It was a mistake to have met you.
I'm breaking this relationship.

561
01:30:00,925 --> 01:30:03,519
Anyway, there wasn't any
relation between the two of us.

562
01:30:05,596 --> 01:30:07,587
We'll never meet again.

563
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,262
I want to forget that we ever met.

564
01:30:13,337 --> 01:30:16,773
It was my loneliness that
brought me closer to you.

565
01:30:18,943 --> 01:30:22,606
I love Raj. And
will always love him.

566
01:33:00,605 --> 01:33:02,436
Where are you?
- Why?

567
01:33:02,506 --> 01:33:06,806
Don't you remember that it's
Khan's birthday party, today?

568
01:33:07,945 --> 01:33:11,437
Yes, we had to go to a party,
today. - Pal, come soon.

569
01:33:13,517 --> 01:33:16,714
Ok, you come soon. I'm
waiting for you. - I'll be there.

570
01:33:51,822 --> 01:33:55,656
Have you come?
- Khan, look who has come.

571
01:33:58,829 --> 01:33:59,818
Where are the flowers?

572
01:34:00,998 --> 01:34:02,829
Where are the flowers?
I forgot to bring them.

573
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,991
And flowers? - Actually, I
forgot to bring a gift, as well.

574
01:34:05,069 --> 01:34:06,832
Forget the gifts and flowers.

575
01:34:06,904 --> 01:34:08,963
Have you brought any
gift for your wife?

576
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:11,838
Gift?

577
01:34:16,013 --> 01:34:19,005
A gift for Sapna?

578
01:34:22,853 --> 01:34:24,718
You've become serious, mate!

579
01:37:28,205 --> 01:37:30,036
What's this?

580
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:45,955
Different shoes!? What's the matter?
You haven't done this before.

581
01:37:47,057 --> 01:37:51,221
How do I tell you, what all
I've done for the first time?

582
01:37:53,063 --> 01:37:56,726
You've started talking in
riddles for the first time.

583
01:37:57,801 --> 01:38:00,235
Life wasn't a riddle
earlier, either.

584
01:38:07,011 --> 01:38:09,002
What's troubling you?

585
01:38:11,415 --> 01:38:14,077
What do I say? What not?

586
01:38:14,818 --> 01:38:17,309
When I woke up, you
weren't even in the room.

587
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:20,551
You must've searched
the whole house. - Yes.

588
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:28,823
Last night, I wasn't able to
get sleep. So I went for a drive.

589
01:38:29,266 --> 01:38:33,828
This too, for the first time.
- Let me change my shoes, else...

590
01:38:33,938 --> 01:38:37,840
...the world would laugh at me,
that too, for the first time.

591
01:39:16,146 --> 01:39:18,307
Today, the police
had visited our house.

592
01:39:21,318 --> 01:39:23,809
Hasn't your husband come with you?

593
01:39:23,887 --> 01:39:28,153
My husband has gone on a
business trip to London.

594
01:39:28,225 --> 01:39:31,160
I know it, pal.

595
01:39:31,228 --> 01:39:34,629
He must be jiggling
with an English woman.

596
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:39,166
All these men belong
to the same breed.

597
01:39:39,236 --> 01:39:43,468
Yes. But, these days, things
are turning out to be different.

598
01:39:54,351 --> 01:39:57,843
Affairs aren't my
department, Rita.

599
01:40:17,207 --> 01:40:18,538
What did the police want?
- Someone's missing.

600
01:40:18,609 --> 01:40:19,598
They wanted to know about him.

601
01:40:55,412 --> 01:40:56,242
What happened?

602
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:21,561
That mean, you...
- Yes. I killed him.

603
01:41:31,448 --> 01:41:33,279
I killed him, accidentally.

604
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:39,078
Only if I could've made
you both writhe in pain.

605
01:41:39,289 --> 01:41:41,951
I have writhed in pain,
because of the two of you.

606
01:41:43,293 --> 01:41:46,626
You're a monster!
- And you? What are you?

607
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:50,466
You've betrayed my trust and love.

608
01:41:50,534 --> 01:41:52,297
You've cheated me.

609
01:41:54,638 --> 01:41:57,471
Did you think about
why I did all this?

610
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:59,702
Don't try to justify yourself.

611
01:41:59,776 --> 01:42:03,337
Did you ever try to find
out the reason for my deeds?

612
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,472
There isn't any reason
for committing a sin.

613
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:09,314
What you did was
nothing but raw lust.

614
01:42:09,386 --> 01:42:11,320
That too, with such a man.

615
01:42:12,156 --> 01:42:16,650
Yes. There's more to a marriage,
than just, love.

616
01:42:17,494 --> 01:42:22,989
In all these years, have you
ever touched me lovingly, even once?

617
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:27,394
Don't shout.
It will crack the walls.

618
01:42:29,673 --> 01:42:32,335
Don't try to dress up your
sins with the garment of words.

619
01:42:32,409 --> 01:42:36,004
What you did was nothing but a sin.

620
01:42:36,346 --> 01:42:39,338
Yes. I've committed a sin.

621
01:42:39,416 --> 01:42:42,544
But, if your friends do it,
they're considered to be lions.

622
01:42:42,619 --> 01:42:45,349
If the same thing is done by a woman,
she's considered to be a bitch.

623
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:54,356
Often, men lose to truth and
take the help of their strength.

624
01:42:56,366 --> 01:42:58,527
I just want a divorce.

625
01:42:59,369 --> 01:43:03,533
I wanted to go to America.
I had dreamt big dreams.

626
01:43:04,107 --> 01:43:06,473
But, now, we both
will go back to India.

627
01:43:07,377 --> 01:43:11,279
We'll get divorced there. We'll get
separated. Then, I'll go to America.

628
01:43:16,853 --> 01:43:18,047
I accept your punishment.
- But, there isn't any...

629
01:43:18,121 --> 01:43:20,783
...sign of repentance in your eyes.

630
01:43:20,857 --> 01:43:23,121
But, it's in my heart.
- But not on your lips.

631
01:43:24,394 --> 01:43:29,388
I'm thinking how could you let go
of me with such a meager punishment?

632
01:43:31,668 --> 01:43:33,431
The punishment for
what I've done should...

633
01:43:33,503 --> 01:43:35,437
...be nothing but a death sentence.

634
01:43:35,572 --> 01:43:39,064
Had it been within me, then I
would've given that to you.

635
01:43:39,576 --> 01:43:43,068
But, as of now, just a divorce.

636
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:46,142
'The pain that has been
aroused in this lonely heart... '

637
01:44:46,643 --> 01:44:52,138
'... has made me afraid
of all kinds of pain.'

638
01:45:10,767 --> 01:45:18,503
'Now, my condition is
such that, I've started...

639
01:45:18,575 --> 01:45:21,510
...doing all kinds of injustice.'

640
01:45:21,578 --> 01:45:28,746
'I've started bowing
before my heart.'

641
01:45:30,787 --> 01:45:36,350
'I've begun crossing all limits.'

642
01:46:19,903 --> 01:46:25,899
'We're so close, you and me.'

643
01:46:25,976 --> 01:46:31,573
'Even then, we've
begun staying apart.'

644
01:46:49,699 --> 01:46:55,467
'This betrayal is making me suffer.'

645
01:46:55,539 --> 01:47:00,602
'And I've started
bearing this gripping pain.'

646
01:47:00,677 --> 01:47:07,606
'I started crying, I've
also started laughing.'

647
01:47:09,786 --> 01:47:15,622
'I've begun crossing all limits.'

648
01:47:21,631 --> 01:47:27,627
'I've begun to perish in your love.'

649
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:36,306
'I've begun crossing all limits.'

650
01:48:02,839 --> 01:48:07,833
A mistake has brought
Sapna and Raj to that swamp.

651
01:48:08,678 --> 01:48:11,670
Coming out of which, is
very difficult, today.

652
01:48:11,748 --> 01:48:15,741
Divorce on one side, and
the police on the other.

653
01:48:52,889 --> 01:48:54,720
The pigeon wants to fly away.

654
01:49:31,761 --> 01:49:33,558
I heard that you're
fleeing to your country, India.

655
01:49:33,763 --> 01:49:35,560
I'm not fleeing, but going.

656
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,433
Can I know why you're going there?

657
01:49:39,502 --> 01:49:42,164
My mother is sick.
- May Allah keep her well!

658
01:49:42,606 --> 01:49:45,166
3 suitcases have been packed.
- I'm packing the fourth one.

659
01:49:45,775 --> 01:49:48,903
Are you going there for a year
or two? - No. Just for 15 days.

660
01:49:48,979 --> 01:49:51,504
With so many luggages, you're
going there for just 15 days?

661
01:49:51,948 --> 01:49:56,180
I've bought gifts for my relatives.
- We, too, are your relatives.

662
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:00,056
Do you want gifts, too?
- Trying to bribe us, eh?

663
01:50:00,123 --> 01:50:02,751
You're the one who is,
naming it as bribe.

664
01:50:03,526 --> 01:50:06,962
You've a habit of arguing.
- Since childhood.

665
01:50:07,797 --> 01:50:09,788
What to do? Not able
to correct it. - Because of a...

666
01:50:09,866 --> 01:50:13,233
...childhood habit, he may have to
spend his youth in jail, Rafique.

667
01:50:15,538 --> 01:50:18,132
Inspector! - You won't
interfere in the middle, madam.

668
01:50:18,808 --> 01:50:22,574
It's that, your sweet
voice melts Rashid's heart.

669
01:50:24,814 --> 01:50:27,806
Let you go? No, we will not.
- Why?

670
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:32,486
Will you force me? - Why? Don't
like that too, since childhood?

671
01:50:32,555 --> 01:50:37,652
How do I tell you what I like
and what I don't, since childhood.

672
01:50:37,727 --> 01:50:40,491
But, you've to tolerate it.
This is our country.

673
01:50:40,563 --> 01:50:43,498
Am I a prisoner here? - If you're not
a criminal, then you're a guest here.

674
01:50:43,566 --> 01:50:45,659
And if you commit a crime,
then a prisoner.

675
01:50:45,835 --> 01:50:50,067
I want to talk to your seniors.
- I'm the senior, too, sir.

676
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:52,836
There's only one above.

677
01:50:52,909 --> 01:50:54,900
But, he doesn't help criminals.

678
01:50:54,978 --> 01:50:57,947
You can't call me a criminal,
before proving the crime.

679
01:50:58,014 --> 01:50:59,845
I can arrest you right now...

680
01:50:59,916 --> 01:51:02,248
...for shouting at me.

681
01:51:17,033 --> 01:51:22,733
Yes, Khan. Take care of the office.
I'll be leaving in a few moments.

682
01:51:22,872 --> 01:51:24,533
Inspector, just a minute.

683
01:51:37,053 --> 01:51:40,545
I'll talk to Mr. Johnson
on reaching Mumbai.

684
01:51:54,904 --> 01:51:56,895
What did you tell them?

685
01:51:57,741 --> 01:52:01,006
I told them that you aren't
connected to this case, in any way.

686
01:52:01,911 --> 01:52:04,846
And they agreed?
- Why won't they?

687
01:52:05,915 --> 01:52:09,681
Anyway, you go, now.
It's time for your flight.

688
01:52:16,926 --> 01:52:18,917
I'll leave the car at the airport.

689
01:52:18,995 --> 01:52:22,396
Khan has a duplicate key. He'll come
home and give it to you, tomorrow.

690
01:52:23,933 --> 01:52:28,927
And somehow, you come
to India after 15 days.

691
01:52:29,939 --> 01:52:32,601
I know that you're in a
hurry to get a divorce.

692
01:52:32,675 --> 01:52:37,271
Don't worry, maybe you
won't need a divorce.

693
01:52:37,347 --> 01:52:41,113
What do you mean?
- I was joking.

694
01:53:22,992 --> 01:53:26,325
Speaking. I'm coming.

695
01:53:27,997 --> 01:53:30,261
Tell me. Which police station
should I come to?

696
01:53:30,333 --> 01:53:32,267
Bushera police station.

697
01:53:32,836 --> 01:53:34,667
I'll be there.

698
01:54:50,079 --> 01:54:53,071
I'm surrendering
myself to the police.

699
01:54:53,149 --> 01:54:55,743
I had told you that you
won't be needing a divorce.

700
01:54:56,085 --> 01:54:59,179
You'll get this letter in India.
Please forgive me.

701
01:56:02,151 --> 01:56:05,143
Sir, I've come.

702
01:56:09,225 --> 01:56:12,160
I had told you that,
as soon as he departs...

703
01:56:12,228 --> 01:56:14,890
...I shall come over
and tell you the truth.

704
01:56:20,336 --> 01:56:22,327
I was the one who killed Ajay.

705
01:56:24,173 --> 01:56:28,837
You can give me
whatever punishment you want.

706
01:56:30,646 --> 01:56:33,171
I accept it, sir.

707
01:56:41,257 --> 01:56:43,191
He's inside.

708
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:12,881
What are you doing?

709
01:57:13,222 --> 01:57:17,056
You! - What are you
doing here? C'mon. Hurry up!

710
01:57:22,231 --> 01:57:23,892
Sapna has arrived.

711
01:57:38,247 --> 01:57:40,238
Sapna isn't there.
- But she was here, a moment back.

712
01:57:42,985 --> 01:57:44,247
Hurry up and get in.

713
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:46,919
But, where will we go?

714
01:57:49,258 --> 01:57:50,247
Hey! Stop!

715
01:57:54,263 --> 01:57:55,924
Where are you running to!? C'mon!

716
01:57:57,266 --> 01:58:00,724
Hurry up. I'm going
to get him, today.

717
01:58:06,275 --> 01:58:08,266
Who was with Sapna
- Don't know.

718
01:58:12,115 --> 01:58:14,276
What were you trying to do?

719
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:16,477
I am asking, what
were you trying to do?

720
01:58:17,286 --> 01:58:19,948
Why didn't you go?
You should've gone.

721
01:58:20,623 --> 01:58:23,956
Are you trying to sacrifice?
What do you think of yourself?

722
01:58:26,028 --> 01:58:29,964
Drive faster. Else, they'll escape.

723
01:58:30,133 --> 01:58:32,624
Did you ever think, if you're
hanged by the government...

724
01:58:32,702 --> 01:58:34,636
...here, then what'll happen of me?

725
01:58:34,704 --> 01:58:36,968
Where could they have gone?

726
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:42,977
Control room! Inspector Rashid,
here. Alert all the units.

727
01:58:45,047 --> 01:58:46,981
Enquire in his house, too.

728
01:58:51,354 --> 01:58:53,322
He must have
directly gone to his house.

729
01:58:57,493 --> 01:59:02,328
Take the car to the airport.

730
01:59:03,332 --> 01:59:04,321
Azhar, they didn't go to their
house. - They can't go there.

731
01:59:56,385 --> 01:59:59,377
Raj Mittal and Sapna
Mittal are traveling to Mumbai.

732
01:59:59,455 --> 02:00:01,047
The airlines by which
they're traveling... - Stop them!

733
02:00:01,123 --> 02:00:02,715
They're being ordered to stop them.

734
02:00:02,792 --> 02:00:04,384
They shouldn't be allowed to board.

735
02:00:50,439 --> 02:00:53,602
Azhar, they aren't in terminal A.
Let's go and check in terminal B.

736
02:01:17,466 --> 02:01:20,458
Azhar, let's go to the diriment.

737
02:01:50,499 --> 02:01:55,493
Rashid, I've never seen
you laughing like this.

738
02:01:57,506 --> 02:01:59,667
That too, when the criminal escaped.

739
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:05,344
When God himself, let them go, then
who are we followers, to stop them?

740
02:02:06,515 --> 02:02:09,848
Azhar, I feel, this was an accident.

741
02:02:09,919 --> 02:02:12,183
Not a murder.

742
02:02:13,522 --> 02:02:18,255
You're right, Rashid. Else, how could
they've escaped our hands? - Right.
