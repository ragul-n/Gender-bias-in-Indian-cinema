1
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,456
Goddess Durga is my Mother...
Goddess Ambe is my Mother...

2
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,461
Sing with me, Gopal and Rupa.

3
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,359
Your brother has arrived, Rupa!
- Really?!

4
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,856
Are you speaking the truth?
- I swear it on our love!

5
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,527
God bless my soul!
Let's go...!

6
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,196
Rupa! You mustn't walk out
on the Goddess's prayers!

7
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,366
The Goddess is my friend...
my Mother!

8
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,542
She'll understand.
My brother has arrived!

9
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:05,650
Villagers! I can never forget the
love and affection you have...

10
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:10,688
bestowed on orphans like me
and my sister Rupa.

11
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,024
So I seek your forgiveness...

12
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:23,862
for I have taken a decision for
my sister, without your consent.

13
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,867
Skip the riddles.
What have you decided?

14
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,370
I have fixed my sister,
Rupa's marriage.

15
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,044
Who is the bridegroom?

16
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,878
What does he do?
Where does he live?

17
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:43,215
He's my colleague's cousin.
Surinder Pratap Singh.

18
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,882
He lives in Belapur which is
in district Ramgarh.

19
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,424
He's a police officer
and Rupa will...

20
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,098
Rupa...

21
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:04,371
Open the door, Rupa!
Or else, I'll go away...

22
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,371
and won't return for the next fair!
- Look at him!

23
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,880
What's up, little one?
Are you angry with me?

24
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:21,253
Why must you get me married and
cut me off from yourself?

25
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,260
Silly girl! Can you ever
be cut off from me?

26
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,094
But every girl has to marry
someday, my little doll.

27
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,939
Or her life remains incomplete.
- That's a bloody cliche!

28
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,901
Vidhyavanti has not yet
got married. And Bulbul...

29
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,104
Come here! Tell my brother...
do you want to get married?

30
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:45,443
No, right? There! She doesn't
want to leave the village either!

31
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,819
But you want to drive me
out of the village!

32
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:53,154
Bulbul is responsible
for her old parents.

33
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,827
But you have your
brother's blessings.

34
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:01,830
Do you want me to get a bad name
for not getting you married?

35
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,667
Is marriage so necessary, brother?
- Yes.

36
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,175
Why is it so?
- Every girl needs a life mate.

37
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:20,019
A man who will protect his wife

38
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,847
You will protect me, brother!
I don't need anyone else!

39
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,890
And what if I die on the Front?
- Brother!

40
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:33,565
Death be to your enemies, brother!
Nothing will happen to you!

41
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,571
So don't snatch
my rights from me.

42
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,406
Okay. As soon as this fair's over,
we'll leave for Belapur.

43
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,749
I've met him just once, actually.
I don't know him well.

44
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,587
All right. We'll decide on the
wedding only if you like him.

45
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:01,551
Is that all right?
- Agree with your brother, brother!

46
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,729
She has always been
a stubborn girl!

47
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:09,560
Let her take her decision, guys!

48
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,233
She's a modern girl. Like me!

49
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,569
See what Vidyavanti says?
So... what have you decided?

50
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,914
My brother!

51
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:28,083
Let me go, mother...
- What happened?

52
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,314
Let me go, mother...
- No, Gopal...

53
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,582
Let me go, I say...

54
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:40,466
You aren't going to marry anyone!
You will marry only me!

55
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,471
You're not going anywhere!

56
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,302
Don't we have such
a happy village!

57
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:59,110
No... may no evil eye ever
be cast on our happiness!

58
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:09,454
Welcome, Minister!
This way, sir...

59
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:14,963
We have organised a fair specially
for you, sir! Welcome, sir...!

60
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:20,635
Give the Minister a big hand!
Welcome, sir...

61
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,637
We've organised a fair
for you, sir... welcome!

62
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,312
Dance, folks!
Give him a big hand!

63
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,646
Our good-fortune, sir...

64
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,857
Welcome, sir...
This fair is for you!

65
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,535
Welcome...
The stage is this way.

66
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,982
Give him a big hand!

67
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,686
Please sit down!

68
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,654
Minister!

69
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,696
The terrorists are here!

70
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,313
Out of my way...

71
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,819
C'mon, Rupa...!

72
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,370
Watch out, son!

73
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:31,368
Gujjar Singh is no ordinary thief!

74
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,378
There's a reward of
millions on his head!

75
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,706
So watch your step!

76
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,714
Let go of my sister!
Let her go!

77
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,382
Brother!

78
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,885
Go on in, Rupa!
- No...

79
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,054
Go on inside, I say!

80
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,952
Put all the guns together!

81
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:59,292
Villagers! Chief!
Come on out! Don't be scared!

82
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,034
Come on... Don't be scared!

83
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,768
Pick up those guns...
Don't be scared!

84
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,770
Look at that, Gujjar!

85
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,443
Once people are rid of
this fear, this terror...

86
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:24,448
no animal like you nor a
terrorist will ever rule again!

87
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:38,164
If only... people were
to be rid of my terror!

88
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,338
What say, lame duck?
- Long live, Gujjar!

89
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,296
No...

90
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:10,160
Kali! Give me the belt!

91
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,674
Get up! On your feet!

92
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,507
You dare raise your
hand at Gujjar!

93
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,184
No... leave my brother alone!

94
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:39,893
Know what, soldier? Your sis
will set whoredom aflame!

95
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,456
She'll be a great whore!

96
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:46,228
Gujjar! I'll have your blood!

97
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,892
Brother... My brother!

98
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,249
Brother!

99
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,415
That's enough...
now come along!

100
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,931
I will destroy you!

101
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:55,633
You will destroy Gujjar, eh?
Your only support...

102
00:27:55,774 --> 00:28:00,575
your brother, has been destroyed,
in trying to take me on!

103
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,574
Which man will you
now look up to?

104
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,084
Rupa! I will help you!

105
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,085
Let my Rupa go!
Leave her alone!

106
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:21,090
Fantastic! Looks like he's the
only real man around!

107
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,303
No...
- Let Rupa go, or else...

108
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,305
You're a kid!
- I'm no kid!

109
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,858
Help!

110
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,138
You will destroy Gujjar, huh?

111
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,471
There's a lot of fire in you.

112
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,807
You have yet to see the fire!

113
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,818
For the treatment you have
meted out to my brother...

114
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,990
I will give you a 100 times
more horrifying death!

115
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,193
Or I won't ever claim to be
my brother's little sister!

116
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:34,699
Sister? You will not be able
to call yourself sister again!

117
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,705
Know what I'm going
to make out of you?

118
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,869
You're going to be my whore!

119
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,878
You won't be able to call
yourself anyone's sister again!

120
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,720
You'll never be a wife ever!
- No! Never!

121
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,759
Wait there, Rupa!

122
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:02,723
There's death ahead!
- I will embrace death, Gujjar!

123
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,266
But I will never live the life of
shame you want me to lead!

124
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,944
Should I be born again,
I will return...

125
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,279
and I will
annihilate you, Gujjar!

126
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:27,621
Silly girl! She was out
to annihilate Gujjar!

127
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:32,094
The man who will annihilate Gujjar
is yet to be born!

128
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,924
Who's that?! Where am I?
- You're on the ground.

129
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,104
C'mon... this isn't a show
or the world of your dreams.

130
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,441
This is a godown.
Get to work!

131
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:41,608
Shankar Shahne! Damn you!
Bloody truck driver!

132
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,782
Who do you think you are?! You
don't dream and don't let me too!

133
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:52,649
And what a beautiful dream I had!
There was beauty all around...

134
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,159
and I was the centre of attraction!
Kishan Pyare... the performer!

135
00:34:56,895 --> 00:35:01,093
I was the star!
- Get down!

136
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,935
We live off this truck.
Not your bloody plays!

137
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:11,109
Wrestler boy! The day I'm a star,
you'll forget your measly meal!

138
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,943
You'll feast on Chicken tandoori!
- Absolutely right!

139
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:19,617
How right you are...
and how sweetly you speak!

140
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,984
Why're you always messing
with your friend, Shankar?

141
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:29,819
Your friend is a really hero!
- Thanks, Patil Rao!

142
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:36,830
This friend of yours will someday
give you the throne, Shankar!

143
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,995
Really? He's more likely
to topple the bloody throne!

144
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:45,335
No... don't say that.
- That's enough, smart ass!

145
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:50,344
I'll present a show in Khanpur...

146
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,050
...that will leave the
audience gaping!

147
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,218
Nobody will watch it!

148
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,681
Nobody will watch it!
And I bloody well say that!

149
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,159
Seth Chaturdas Popatlal...
Welcome!

150
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,825
Return the advance!

151
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:10,162
Your Khanpur show is cancelled!
- Why, sir?

152
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,162
I was slippered at the last show!

153
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:18,501
You always promise me a girl
and dress up a male for the act!

154
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,845
I want a real heroine this time!
A real bloody heroine!

155
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,514
We have the heroine ready!
- Where is she?

156
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:30,217
She lives on the way to Khanpur;
just two hours away!

157
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,013
What a heroine, sir!
She's explosive!

158
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,223
Young and tender...
with a slender waist!

159
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:42,896
She's young and tender? Really?
- I swear it on your paunch!

160
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:47,571
You have sworn on my paunch.
I'll give you another opportunity.

161
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,230
That's something!
- But remember...

162
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:53,406
if they hurl rotten tomatoes
and slippers at me again...

163
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:58,742
you're going to be shot!
- Don't you worry, sir!

164
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:03,184
Go and sell the tickets and rake
in the dough. I'll follow you!

165
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,883
Remember... a real heroine.
- Sure. The real heroine!

166
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,722
No make-believe!
- No, sir! Not at all!

167
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:15,725
The fraud! You've conned
him again, haven't you?

168
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,231
Why did you lie to him?
- And Why not?

169
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,729
He'd have cancelled the show and
put an end to my dreams!

170
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,907
Where are you going to find
the heroine now? Where?

171
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:28,405
On the way to Khanpur, of course!

172
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:34,579
God often listens to what people
say, as He has heard you today.

173
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:39,285
What does that mean?
- Champakali! She lives on the way!

174
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:46,297
My niece! What a dancer she is
and what a fabulous singer too!

175
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,962
Looks like she was born
to perform in your shows.

176
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:53,804
All she needs is an opportunity.
Just the one you have!

177
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,132
Give me the address and I'll
give her the opportunity!

178
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,569
Thank you, God!
You'll certainly make it someday!

179
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:06,417
Let's go, smart-ass!
Load the stuff and hit the roads!

180
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,949
Looks like destiny is going
to smile on me at last!

181
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,624
Stop!

182
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,632
What have you stopped here for?
- For a bath.

183
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,629
I'll have a bath, freshen up
and go after the girl!

184
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,638
Bathe here now? But you bathed
last week, didn't you?

185
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,973
Smart-ass! You wouldn't know
about the girls!

186
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,976
A guy's got to look good
to woo the girl!

187
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:42,820
Look! My red trousers and the
yellow shirt to meet Champakali!

188
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:55,358
Shankar! Take a dip!
The water's just great!

189
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:31,531
You're alive, Rupa...

190
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,704
But what for?

191
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:39,869
"You have nothing left...
you are finished!"

192
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:44,043
Your brother has been killed

193
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,376
"You have nothing to live
for, Rupa. No one at all"

194
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:54,083
"You're all alone, Rupa...
you're on your own"

195
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,434
"No, Rupa!
This is no time to despair"

196
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:10,607
"This new lease of life is
a boon to destroy the enemy"

197
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:15,438
"He has ruined you... he has
snatched your brother from you"

198
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:20,951
"You must avenge your
humiliation, Rupa"

199
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,778
How will you accomplish it?

200
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,485
Who will help you?"

201
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,493
There is someone! Your fiancée.

202
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,499
The man your brother chose for you

203
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:41,163
"He will accept you...
he will protect you"

204
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:45,839
"And he will make sure
that you are given justice"

205
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,559
Hey frog! Are you coming out
or must I leave?

206
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,162
Here I come...

207
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,663
He won't even let me
bathe in peace!

208
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:17,500
"These clothes I choose
for you, Champakali..."

209
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,009
"A few short ones;
a few fat ones..."

210
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,553
Kishankali!
Don't you look gorgeous!

211
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,395
Blame the waters!
It turns a man into a woman!

212
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,397
Where are my clothes, smart-ass?
- I don't know. I was asleep.

213
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:48,230
And my clothes vanished, eh?
- An animal could've taken them.

214
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:51,235
Why would an animal
steal my clothes?

215
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,576
They go around in the nude.
And this is...

216
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,413
Wait a minute!
This is a ghagra-choli!

217
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,850
It was no animal!
It was a girl!

218
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,721
The bloody thief has made away
with my new trousers and shirt!

219
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:09,051
She left these tatters for me...
What the hell were you up to?

220
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:14,728
Shut up! My wallet was lying in
my trousers! She stole that too!

221
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,567
Hey thief!

222
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:28,571
You have a lot of money, lady...
what will you eat?

223
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,574
Pancakes? Beans?
What will you have?

224
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,908
Get me anything.
- In a jiffy.

225
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,482
Excuse me...
- Anything else?

226
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:41,621
How do I get to Belapur?
- It's an 18-hour journey.

227
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:47,123
There's a bus for Khanpur. From there
you take another bus to Belapur.

228
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:51,634
But today's bus has left.
You will get a bus tomorrow.

229
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,808
Look there, boss!

230
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,239
What stuff!
- She's delicious!

231
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:13,118
Like liver-fry!
- She's a whore.

232
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,450
A whore?
- Of course.

233
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,960
Look at her counting the money.
How'd she get so much of money?

234
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:26,799
That girl stole my clothes
and you didn't even notice!

235
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,299
You notice girls.
I don't.

236
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,141
Just shut up now
and let's eat. C'mon.

237
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:41,311
Can you think of anything but food?
- Can you think of anything but girls?

238
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:45,813
C'mon! How can you compare food
with girls! That's a sin!

239
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,683
Girls are...

240
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,025
Damn her! Shankar!
Look there!

241
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,102
A girl again?
- Look at her clothes!

242
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:02,133
She's the one who stole my clothes
and she's wearing them, too!

243
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,465
The same red trousers
and yellow shirt.

244
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,308
I'll go and get her.
- Relax.

245
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:12,649
Why score with every girl you see?
- Damn it! You suspect me?!

246
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:15,018
There! She has my wallet too!

247
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:20,520
I can't take this anymore...
I'll push the whore into business.

248
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,692
The bloody thief!
I'll get her right now!

249
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,703
Gotcha! You sit here
counting my money!

250
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,701
What did you think?
That I wouldn't catch up with you?

251
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,707
Shankar! The wallet!

252
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:46,709
You don't know who I am!
Kishan Bindas, the school drop-out!

253
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:50,879
Step out of those clothes...
Go on! Strip!

254
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:56,085
What the hell are you doing?
Get lost!

255
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,188
This yellow and red is mine!
- Where have You sprung from?

256
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:04,360
The red and yellow is mine!
- I saw her first!

257
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:08,036
So does it belong to you?
I bought it in Bhopal!

258
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,373
I've paid 300 bucks for it!

259
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:17,043
I'll pay 600.

260
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,374
No... it's not up for sale.

261
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,919
Shut up, jerk!
C'mon...

262
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:28,251
Don't you touch her!
You'll spoil the crease!

263
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,586
The crease?
- Sure. It costs money!

264
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,764
And it looks great.
- What crease, punk?

265
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:40,263
Narinder! Isn't he crazy?
- Forget him. Go for the babe.

266
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,766
The babe, eh?

267
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,549
You have torn my yellow shirt!

268
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,655
Godamn you!

269
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:17,770
One, two... six of them!
That's one too many!

270
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:23,772
It's time for my lunch!

271
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,944
What are you talking about?
I'll get killed!

272
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,552
You hit me when I'm
talking to someone...!

273
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:53,176
I'm getting a beating and you're
enjoying a yogurt-drink!

274
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,011
You messed with them.
So you handle them.

275
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,165
You aren't a friend!
You're an enemy!

276
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,825
Rather than...
- Okay. Let me eat.

277
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,685
Don't watch! Kill him!

278
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:44,556
You've joined me, Shankar!

279
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:29,231
Man in the beard!
Wait!

280
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,906
Why bash me up?
The girl's vanished!

281
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,245
She has vanished!

282
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:44,284
To hell with you, you thief!

283
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:49,955
She has fled with my
trousers and my shirt!

284
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,126
But we've saved the wallet.
Give it to me.

285
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:04,072
Who's going to pay for the losses
you've caused at the eatery, son?

286
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,401
Why must I?
The chap in the beard...

287
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:11,638
Where are you?!
They've both fled!

288
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,783
But you're here...
give me the money.

289
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,753
But...
- He has suffered losses...

290
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,621
and you must compensate for it.
- He's right.

291
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,694
Do drop in everyday!

292
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,629
I'll knock her teeth out
if I get my hands on her!

293
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:33,469
I've told you not
to mess with girls.

294
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,468
They don't have brakes...
the accident is inevitable.

295
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,971
Girls are trouble.
They're a total loss...

296
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:43,476
Shut up, smart-ass! And hurry.
The girl's waiting for us.

297
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:48,477
A girl again?
- The heroine! Champakali!

298
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,646
Hurry! We've got to reach
Khanpur with her.

299
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:56,860
"They're going to Khanpur from where
you'll get a bus to Belapur"

300
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,358
"Don't waste time.
Go with them"

301
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:12,033
Stop the truck, Shankar.
- What for?

302
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:18,874
I want to pee. My bladder's full.
- No. The truck won't stop.

303
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,917
What nonsense? Stop it!
It's an emergency!

304
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:27,389
No, I say! I will stop
only at Khanpur now.

305
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:32,094
Khanpur?! That's four hours away!
My bladder will burst!

306
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,761
Stop the truck, please!
- No.

307
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,435
You're at the wheels.
So you act smart! Bloody...

308
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:45,772
Watch it! It's worse
on those pot-holes!

309
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,951
What are you doing?!
We drink from that!

310
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,755
We won't anymore.
- When are You going to change?

311
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:06,429
Hand me the other bottle!
Quick!

312
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,425
Hurry!
- You're a bloody animal!

313
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:15,438
Didn't I say it'd burst?
What an idea!

314
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,773
We no longer have to
stop the truck.

315
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:24,438
You're the eternal beast!
- Why have You stopped now?

316
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:28,618
Look ahead.
- My word! The police?

317
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:45,501
Hello, Constable!
- I'm not a Constable!

318
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:50,840
I'm Inspector Pakkad Singh!
- Fantastic! Great name!

319
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:56,171
Inspector Pakoda Singh.
- No! The name is Pakkad Singh!

320
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,650
I know all about the
smuggling in explosives.

321
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,320
What are you carrying?
- Why must You check our truck, sir?

322
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,990
We're decent guys.
- Decent guys indeed...

323
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:14,994
Decent? You drive after drinking!
What's that?

324
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,666
This isn't liquor, sir!
It's something else.

325
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,995
I'm a cop!
I can tell from the colour!

326
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,172
Give it to me.

327
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:32,348
Strange! Foreign liquor
in an Indian bottle!

328
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,312
I must taste it...
- No, sir. Please don't...

329
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,486
Shut up!

330
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,026
I'm going to get beaten up!

331
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,559
Fantastic stuff!
What liquor is this?

332
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:54,226
Absolutely fresh, sir.
Straight from the source.

333
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:59,238
Are you carrying some in the truck?
- No, sir. Only oranges.

334
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,669
I see! The local stuff
in the truck, eh?

335
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,847
I will check!

336
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:18,061
What are you carrying?
Liquor and girls?!

337
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,393
What's the girl doing there?
- Which girl?

338
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:25,725
The one you've hidden!
Get down!

339
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,732
Now what's this?

340
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,243
Where's the girl?
- She was here! Where's she now?

341
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,905
You are drunk, Inspector.

342
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:42,285
Go on, guys...
get on with your work!

343
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,622
There was a girl here...
where has she gone?

344
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:49,458
Am I really drunk?
This is great stuff.

345
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,626
Where's the other bottle?
- Well, sir...

346
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:58,798
Give me the other bottle!
- Go ahead. You Can make more.

347
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,728
Here you are, sir.
Have a nice time!

348
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,406
Good bye, Mr Pakoda Singh.
- The name is Pakkad Singh!

349
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,246
Go on... get lost!

350
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,385
What stuff is this that I
imagine girls after drinking it?

351
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:28,293
See the power? He was drunk
and imagined a girl in the truck!

352
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:32,465
Wouldn't life be made if we had one?
- There is a girl In The truck.

353
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,797
Are you drunk too?
- Didn't you see the orange peels?

354
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,304
Must've been the work of rats.
There was no girl there.

355
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,474
She's up there.
- Where?

356
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,476
There. Take a look!

357
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,686
Damn you! It's the thief!

358
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:59,187
Get down, you bloody thief!
Give me my clothes! C'mon!

359
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,624
What will she wear if
she gives you the clothes?

360
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:06,302
What were you doing in the truck?
Tell us!

361
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,638
I want to go to Khanpur...
- So you know we're headed there!

362
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,134
What will you do in Khanpur?
Have you committed a theft?

363
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,646
I am not a thief.
I have other compulsions.

364
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:22,144
What compulsions?
- Oh mother...

365
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,517
Mother?
- I have a mother In the village.

366
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,356
So does everybody.
What's new?

367
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:35,022
I have a step-mother.
- A step-Mother?

368
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:42,702
She's forcing me to marry
an old man, a drunkard.

369
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:46,868
An old tyre for a new car?!
A wicked step-mother, all right!

370
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,541
Don't worry. We'll take you
to Khanpur. Come...

371
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,874
My foot! She's lying!
I've heard those tales!

372
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,209
Get the hell out of here, lady.
Go on!

373
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,750
What are you saying, Shankar?
- I'm not going to mess with girls!

374
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:01,351
Go on... get lost!

375
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,350
You come with me!

376
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,854
Where will the poor girl
go in the forests?

377
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:11,200
There... she's crying!
- She's like the unseasonal rains.

378
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,032
She cries today...
she'll make you cry some day.

379
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,370
Go ahead and call her!
The bloody jester!

380
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:22,378
What did you say?
Jester?!

381
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,514
Wait there, you thief!

382
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,377
I've found her!
Oh yes, I have!

383
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:34,416
Want to go to Khanpur?
- Yes...

384
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,759
We'll take you there!
But I have a condition!

385
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,095
You'll have to perform
with me in a show!

386
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,761
Perform in a show?
- Yes! Can You sing?

387
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:48,430
And dance? Like this...
sway your hips? Can you do it?

388
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,767
We'll take you to Khanpur if
you perform with us in the show.

389
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,611
I can do it!
I will perform with you!

390
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,781
Will you?
- Yes, I will!

391
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,751
We've found our heroine, Shankar!

392
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,689
Count this, Shankar.
It's 5000 Rupees.

393
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,352
Here you are.
- What's this for?

394
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:11,427
One of the crates has
less of oranges and apples.

395
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:15,764
You're an honest man.
- I charge only for what I do.

396
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,095
Is there anything else?
- A delivery Of oranges And apples.

397
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,940
To Haripur. Want to go?
- It's pretty far away.

398
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,608
It'll cost you a lot of money.
- Don't worry about the money.

399
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,779
But you must leave today.
- My friend has a show tonight.

400
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,442
All right. I'll leave
immediately after the show.

401
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,819
Okay?
- Okay.

402
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,333
Kali! It's ages since
I've seen you. What's up?

403
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,835
The men in uniform
seem to be everywhere.

404
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:00,274
You're right.
- Is My stuff ready?

405
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:04,446
Absolutely. Come with me.

406
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:11,180
Here you are... take a look.
- But these are apples.

407
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,823
If that's an apple...
what's this?

408
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:21,163
Apples are good for health.
- Oh yes. They're excellent!

409
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:24,830
Have the stuff loaded.
I'll go and have some apple-juice.

410
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,902
Go ahead...

411
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:32,671
Load the white crate
in Kali's truck...

412
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,844
and the black crate in
Shankar's truck. Okay?

413
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:42,509
The white one in Kali's truck
and the black one in Shankar's!

414
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:47,856
Bloody drunkard! You'll get
a thrashing if you mess up!

415
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:03,997
"Kali's truck gets
Shankar's crates..."

416
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:07,774
"and Shankar's truck
gets all the rest"

417
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,227
Get a hold on your hearts, folks!

418
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:30,228
I will present to you a girl...

419
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:35,230
whom the Lord has taken
His own time to make!

420
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:36,628
Give her a big hand!

421
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,237
Hurry up, madam...
it's time for the show!

422
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,246
Why's she taking so much of time?
Maybe because she's the heroine!

423
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,746
Step aside, mister...

424
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,632
Ye lovers of beauty...

425
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,639
How do I describe her cheeks...

426
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:15,644
her flowing hair, her gait...
they're all so wonderful!

427
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:19,808
Her looks could kill!

428
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:26,481
Her wrists are so soft...
by God!

429
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,184
Stop it... you're in
for a thrashing.

430
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:33,688
Her body is like the roses
blooming in the gardens!

431
01:00:34,598 --> 01:00:39,695
Her eyes are golden!
Give her a big hand!

432
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:48,203
See the applause?
- Wait For The brickbats.

433
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:53,712
Nobody can stop me today!
The artist in me has awakened!

434
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,711
And your heroine has bolted.
- What nonsense?!

435
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,018
Take another look!
She must be in the loo!

436
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,353
We looked everywhere...
she has fled.

437
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,527
Has she? I've had it!

438
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:12,367
This is a terrible crowd!
They'll treat me like an egg!

439
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,862
And that chap will make
mincemeat out of you.

440
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:19,368
If I go bust today...
you won't live anymore!

441
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:21,842
So what am I going to do?

442
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:29,214
Friends! Before starting the show...

443
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,753
I want to say something to you.

444
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:37,088
A man must never lose
sight of humanity!

445
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:41,263
No matter what happens, man must
not behave like a beast!

446
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:45,594
Cut the crap and start the show!
Take that!

447
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:52,601
I'm overcome with emotions
at your show of affection.

448
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,946
What else can an actor
ever want...

449
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:01,207
if he has a sympathetic audience
like you on his side?

450
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,419
All we want is the girl!
Get the girl here, punk!

451
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,922
Where am I going to
get the girl from?

452
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,922
Where's the bus-terminus?
- I don't know.

453
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,937
Mister... where's the
bus terminus?

454
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,318
Do something, smart-ass!
Save me!

455
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,825
Why do you mess with girls?
She has fled!

456
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,155
She has arrived!

457
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:58,166
Step aside... my heroine
has arrived!

458
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:08,117
Our heroine is here, friends!
Give her a big hand!

459
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:13,484
Where the hell were you?
- I...

460
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,317
Stop bleating like a goat
and dance!

461
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,087
I don't know any dance!
- You said you knew it!

462
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:23,165
So what's wrong now?
- I had lied to you!

463
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:27,161
Let me go... please!
- You can't run away like this!

464
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,835
You lie to us at every step! Go
ahead and start the show, Kishan.

465
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,510
Let me see how she
refuses to dance!

466
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:33,420
Welcome, Inspector!
I'm glad you have arrived!

467
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:37,418
There's darkness everywhere, sir!
Only you can shed some light!

468
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,755
Who was she?

469
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,438
You?!
What are you doing here?

470
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:58,440
You have recognised me...
- The name is Pakkad Singh!

471
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,183
I don't recognise anyone
when I'm on duty!

472
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,587
So who was she?

473
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:10,724
Well... she was the one you
saw in the truck!

474
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,755
Was she? But you said there
was no girl in the truck!

475
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,258
It's like this; she was there
when you saw her.

476
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:21,265
We thought she wasn't there
because we didn't find her there.

477
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,099
But we realised that we thought
she wasn't there, while she was!

478
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:30,605
I can't understand this...
She was there when I saw her?

479
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,110
Yes, we thought she wasn't there.
- Didn't you see her?

480
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:36,946
But she was there!
- Cut this crap of there and not!

481
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:40,780
Are you trying to fool me?
I'll have you thrown in the cell!

482
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:42,615
What's his crime?

483
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,757
Does he have the weapon?
- No.

484
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:48,159
Have you found the body?
- No.

485
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:52,159
So how will you arrest us?
- A smart-ass, isn't he?

486
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:55,998
That he is, Inspector.
- I'm Pakkad Singh!

487
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:59,332
The day I get the evidence,
you go straight to the cell!

488
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:03,102
The name's Pakkad Singh...
she was there and wasn't! Damn it!

489
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:08,443
Come here.
- What is it, Inspector?

490
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:11,949
Do you have some more?
- More Of what?

491
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,282
That heady stuff you gave me...?
- Inspector!

492
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,661
You're 5 minutes late. I'd have
given you half a dozen bottles!

493
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:24,825
Will another brand do?
- That stuff You gave me...

494
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,829
there's nothing that
stands up to it!

495
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,503
I'll come back with the
evidence, smart-ass!

496
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:37,008
The next show I perform
for you...

497
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,845
Shut up! Have you had enough?

498
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,722
Didn't I tell you
girls are trouble?

499
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:52,219
I'll knock your teeth out if you
even talk about a girl again!

500
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:56,557
You're right! I'll never
even look at a girl again.

501
01:13:57,133 --> 01:14:01,331
Girls are trouble, all right!
But she was beautiful trouble!

502
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,902
"My swaying hips...
watch out, mister"

503
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:08,009
There you go again!
- Let's go. We're getting late!

504
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:12,441
God's angry! I wonder who's
going to take the lightning!

505
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,057
This is Belapur!

506
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:46,581
Who is it?
- I'm Rupa.

507
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:54,288
I'm Ram Singh's sister

508
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:58,582
What're you doing here all alone?
And where's Ram Singh?

509
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:05,298
He's dead...
he has been murdered!

510
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:10,238
Don't cry, girl...
come on inside.

511
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:24,912
And thus, everything was destroyed.

512
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:30,618
I have nothing left now!

513
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,621
My brother was mercilessly killed.

514
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,467
My little friend was murdered!

515
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,568
They have inflicted many
atrocities on us!

516
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:46,801
All right... that's enough.
Everything will be all right.

517
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:52,977
I've come to you with great hopes.
I expect you to help me!

518
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,977
You are the one my brother
had chosen for me, aren't you?

519
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,911
The one who will protect me
and be my companion for life?

520
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:05,790
You will protect me and help me
take revenge, won't you?

521
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:11,959
You sure are a hot one!
You're devastatingly beautiful.

522
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,470
It's okay if you're a bit crazy.

523
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:21,810
Listen... forget the past.

524
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:24,979
Forget your brother and Gujjar.

525
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:27,982
Always look ahead in life!

526
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:34,419
Life is supposed to be enjoyed.

527
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,686
We'll have a lot of fun...
- No...

528
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,693
We'll get married, too.
- No...

529
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:49,696
Feeling cold?
Have a sip... Go on.

530
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,772
No...
- Have some!

531
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:56,200
Snooty bitch! I was the one your
brother had chosen for you!

532
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:59,708
Let me go... No!

533
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,488
Wait!

534
01:17:20,436 --> 01:17:21,698
Wait there, you bitch!

535
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,211
Where will you go?!

536
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:33,103
I've been defeated...
I have lost, Mother!

537
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:40,444
But if I am weak today...
You shall be weak too!

538
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:43,109
Every woman in the world
will weaken!

539
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:50,484
Do You want that
to be true, Mother?

540
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:52,826
You?

541
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,657
Do not inflict any more
atrocities on me!

542
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:04,934
Help me!
Show me the way, mother...

543
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:11,943
Show me the way!

544
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:22,290
Help me, Mother!

545
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:31,662
C'mon!
- Mother!

546
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:37,330
C'mon, I say!
- Let me go! Leave me alone!

547
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,344
Stop the truck, smart ass!
A girl's calling out to me!

548
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:57,024
Shut up! Where would a girl
spring from at this hour?

549
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,723
Didn't I tell you not to
even talk about girls?

550
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:04,899
There! She knows you too!
She's calling out to you!

551
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:11,568
Kishan? Shankar?
I hope it's not a ghost!

552
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,577
Look there!
On the steps of the temple!

553
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,573
Damn those rotten...
That's our heroine!

554
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,078
And it's the cave-man she
had stabbed at the show!

555
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:30,749
I think this is serious!
Stop the truck and...

556
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:36,627
No! Why must we mess
with a girl?

557
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:39,800
Don't stop the truck...
take a left, let's go.

558
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:43,304
Help! Kishen!

559
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:47,967
I think those beasts will rape her.
They might even kill her.

560
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:51,141
What do you think?
...but why must we bother?

561
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:55,643
We won't mess with girls!
Let's go! Don't stop the truck!

562
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:00,418
It's okay if you've stopped...
but let's not drive back.

563
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:09,130
It's okay if you've driven back,
but just don't step down!

564
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,958
We mustn't mess with girls...
- Shut up!

565
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,636
He's gone! It's my turn now!

566
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:39,521
Let me go!

567
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,693
Hey, lady... leave her alone!

568
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:48,926
"What are you scared of,
when we're with you?"

569
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:53,434
"What are you thinking about,
silly girl?"

570
01:24:00,002 --> 01:24:01,435
Freeze!

571
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:06,937
Cave-man! You want to
play around with guns, eh?

572
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,110
You're a dangerous man!

573
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:32,832
Look, Rupa!

574
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:36,836
"Your saviours were with you and
you couldn't recognise them!"

575
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:43,509
"They are the duo who will
avenge your humiliation!"

576
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,346
"This is the way the
Goddess Mother has shown you"

577
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,841
But why will they help you?

578
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:53,520
"Nobody helps anybody
without a good reason"

579
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:58,358
"They will help you only when
you forge relations with them"

580
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,327
"Your beauty has always
been a curse for you"

581
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:05,165
"But now, it will be
your greatest weapon"

582
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:10,497
"Look at Kishen;
the eternal romantic"

583
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:14,675
"Cast the trap of love...
and he'll fall into it"

584
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,177
And look at Shankar...

585
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:19,680
"The real friend,
companion and comrade"

586
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:23,016
"The combined strength
of these men..."

587
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,052
"will take you to your goal."

588
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,197
What did you say?
The girl's alive?

589
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,570
Yes, Gujjar. She's alive!

590
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:31,077
You're stupid and blind!

591
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:36,586
Don't you remember?
She fell off the cliff.

592
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:41,625
But she has survived.
Ask them, if you don't believe me.

593
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,123
That's right, Gujjar.

594
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:59,313
And you guys return empty-handed?
Without her?!

595
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:04,247
I had caught her, Gujjar.
But she stabbed me and escaped!

596
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:05,418
She gave me a wound!

597
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:13,291
It's me she has given a wound to.
A wound that hasn't yet healed.

598
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:18,132
She's a hot one!

599
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:28,135
My wound will heal only when
I quench her fires!

600
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:31,145
The butterfly!

601
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:39,814
She will return to me!

602
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:45,316
There are no explosives!
There are apples in the crate!

603
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:52,291
Look again! D'you want

604
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:56,370
Blind bat! The explosives are
under the apples and oranges!

605
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:59,972
They're only fruits.
- Look again.

606
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:16,683
So you've bought fruits

607
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:22,487
I had bought arms!

608
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:35,705
Whom must I ask now?
- Forgive me, Gujjar! Please!

609
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:40,278
I think it's the girl's doing!

610
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:43,884
She wasn't alone.
She had the two boys with her!

611
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:48,546
So the boys have
found the girl, eh?

612
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:54,758
If you love your life, Kali...

613
01:28:54,996 --> 01:29:00,628
you must find the explosives
and the girl for me.

614
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:05,865
I want both...
both!

615
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:10,207
Please trust me!

616
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:14,211
He was the one my step-mother
wanted me to marry.

617
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:17,710
It was the monster I've
been running away from!

618
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:23,053
That's the truth! Believe me!
That is really my story...

619
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:29,562
Stop crying...
everything's going to be all right.

620
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:33,597
What's going to be all right?
I'm all alone...

621
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:36,599
I have no one of my own!
- Don't say that.

622
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:40,270
We're with you...

623
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:42,601
What say, Shankar?

624
01:29:43,345 --> 01:29:49,944
I found real happiness the day
I performed with you at the show!

625
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,781
I was so thrilled!
- Really? Are you fond of acting?

626
01:29:54,022 --> 01:29:57,219
Very much. This is the way that

627
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:01,658
Really? Will you be forever

628
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:06,299
Your heroine? I?!
- Of course!

629
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:09,335
Won't it be fun when two
jesters get together?!

630
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:13,507
Sucker!
You're letting her con you!

631
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:17,503
Don't believe her stories! She
changes colour like the chameleon.

632
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,839
What's wrong with you,
stone-hearted man?

633
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,012
Your heart is black
after all that driving!

634
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:26,854
Didn't the poor girl's
sad story, move your heart?

635
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:31,024
Poor girl, eh?
She's going to sell us both!

636
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:33,556
She's no wax-doll...
she's plain trouble!

637
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:36,059
Let's go. Leave her alone.

638
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:41,063
No! My heroine will accompany
me, everywhere I go. Okay?

639
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:42,401
C'mon...

640
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:49,736
She won't sit in that truck!
- Why not?

641
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:53,414
Because I say so!

642
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:57,084
I own the truck!
- I see!

643
01:30:58,153 --> 01:31:00,178
You've really stooped to

644
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:04,691
And you call me your friend!
Your best friend!

645
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,890
I don't want to argue
with you, Kishan.

646
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,393
But there's no place for
this cobra in my truck!

647
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:15,236
Whom did you call a cobra?
Watch your tongue! Or else...

648
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:18,068
What are you going to
do about it?

649
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:23,403
What, huh? I'll show you!

650
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:30,080
See? How's that?
- Idiot! What've you done?!

651
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:35,589
You hit me so hard, eh?

652
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:39,458
That hurt, didn't it?

653
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:43,421
Threatening me, are you?

654
01:31:47,202 --> 01:31:48,794
I've had it!

655
01:31:58,213 --> 01:32:01,341
Shankar! My back is broken!
Give me a hand...

656
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:09,415
Wasn't that great acting?
Hit me, eh...?

657
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,793
What are you doing?!

658
01:32:13,962 --> 01:32:18,126
You'll break my head!

659
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,804
Now take this!

660
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:31,301
Don't you dare, Shankar!

661
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,316
Wait! Why are you fighting
over me?

662
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:45,322
Shut up! This is between us!
Keep the dramatics out, okay?

663
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:49,190
Talk to me, smart-ass!

664
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:53,332
I've taken enough! Will you let

665
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:58,368
I said 'no'!
- Good bye! Our friendship is over!

666
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:01,799
You go there and I'll go there!

667
01:33:02,544 --> 01:33:07,641
Who does he think he is?

668
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:10,817
You've been the best of...
- Don't worry. Just keep walking.

669
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:14,821
He's a buddy! I know him well!

670
01:33:15,223 --> 01:33:17,316
He can't spend a
moment without me!

671
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,527
Take a look at him...
He must be scowling at me!

672
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:27,026
Yes, he's scowling.

673
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:34,703
Yes, he has kicked it!

674
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:40,708
How did you know that?
- He has the dirty habit!

675
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:44,385
He'll now start the truck,

676
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,551
Yes, he's coming to us!
- So let him.

677
01:33:57,332 --> 01:34:00,859
He's gone!

678
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:06,202
Sure! He has stopped!

679
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:28,925
He'll now say, "Skip the act

680
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:32,597
That's enough, jester!

681
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:36,266
How about my heroine?

682
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:40,099
All right. I'll get in
since you say so...

683
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:41,432
The bloody idiot!

684
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:45,771
Shall we go?
- Let's go.

685
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:49,612
God bless my soul!

686
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:59,591
What a great joke!
I have never laughed so much!

687
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,592
I've never made someone
laugh so much either.

688
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:04,220
You have to weep after
you have laughed.

689
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,427
I was stunned to see you handle

690
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:13,273
You were great! Where did you
learn such marksmanship?

691
01:35:13,508 --> 01:35:16,443
My uncle was a soldier!

692
01:35:16,678 --> 01:35:20,114
He gave me a gun when I was a kid.
And I became an "export".

693
01:35:21,516 --> 01:35:25,782
Where did you learn it, Shankar?
- His uncle was my father.

694
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:28,284
All right.
Stop spinning a yarn!

695
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:33,286
He's jealous of me!
- You have a unique friendship.

696
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,257
Don't be formal with me.

697
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:40,333
All right. I won't be formal
with you anymore, Pyare.

698
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,495
What did you call me?
- Pyare (loved one).

699
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:46,267
Say that again!

700
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:51,170
Gawd! No one has ever
called me that before!

701
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:54,506
But I will call you that.
Pyare...

702
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,180
Will that do?
- Of course. It'll do!

703
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:02,446
Lt'll more than do!
- Shut up!

704
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:05,992
Don't take him seriously...

705
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:09,955
You haven't told us your name!
What's your name?

706
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:15,498
My name...?
- Think It over.

707
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:20,333
Decide on a nice name.
- Shut up! What's your name?

708
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:25,171
Your name is Kishan.

709
01:36:26,748 --> 01:36:30,514
My God!

710
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:33,015
You're flat and so's the tyre!

711
01:36:34,756 --> 01:36:37,520
We have a puncture.
So come down to earth!

712
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:44,863
Take the tyre and the standby.
Go and get the puncture fixed.

713
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:48,398
Why must I? You go on!

714
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:53,733
It's your turn now.
- Did you? All right.

715
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,737
He's always scolding me...

716
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:13,851
What's wrong with you?

717
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:17,495
My stomach! It has a headache!
- Your stomach has a headache?!

718
01:37:17,632 --> 01:37:20,396
Yes...
- I know your excuses well!

719
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:24,060
I'm speaking the truth!
- All right. I'll go on.

720
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:26,501
But you will take

721
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:29,405
I might return at dusk.
- Come in the night, no problem!

722
01:37:29,644 --> 01:37:30,906
Take your own time...
we are in no hurry!

723
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,746
I'll take care...
what a buddy!

724
01:37:38,386 --> 01:37:40,320
I conned him, all right!

725
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:19,378
Go on, Pyare...

726
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:30,086
You were scared, Pyare!
- Obviously! What joke is this?

727
01:40:30,324 --> 01:40:32,258
What if you had drowned?
- So what?

728
01:40:32,827 --> 01:40:35,421
Drowning has its own fun...

729
01:40:37,999 --> 01:40:43,938
Damn it! You're very fond
of drowning, aren't you?

730
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:50,777
Is there anything wrong in drowning?
- No... a bit of a danger, however.

731
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:56,479
You're afraid of dangers.
- I'm scared of nothing!

732
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:01,245
Really? Aren't you scared
of anything?

733
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:09,759
So hold my hand, Pyare.
- Think it over, lady!

734
01:41:10,831 --> 01:41:14,426
I won't leave the hand,
once I've held it.

735
01:41:16,704 --> 01:41:20,265
How about holding it first?

736
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:24,140
Damn it...

737
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,815
C'mon, Pyare... C'mon!

738
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:36,080
See? It isn't so easy
to get hold of my hand!

739
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:39,656
Really? Wait till I show you!

740
01:42:01,549 --> 01:42:06,486
Yes... but please let go.

741
01:42:08,556 --> 01:42:12,652
It hurts! Please let me go!

742
01:42:14,729 --> 01:42:18,825
Gawd! She's dangerous!

743
01:42:29,944 --> 01:42:32,708
I could die for you!

744
01:42:35,616 --> 01:42:37,880
But why are you staring at me?

745
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:33,709
They've taken the goods
and gone towards Haripur!

746
01:47:34,615 --> 01:47:40,383
What's the truck's licence number?

747
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:43,055
What are their names?

748
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:49,718
Kishan... and Shankar.

749
01:47:56,336 --> 01:48:00,033
Shankar! How are you,
my friend?

750
01:48:00,274 --> 01:48:03,141
What's up? You've remembered

751
01:48:03,277 --> 01:48:07,213
How can you say that, chum?
I'm always worried about you.

752
01:48:08,115 --> 01:48:10,549
So I've taken a decision today.

753
01:48:11,285 --> 01:48:14,379
5,000? You've become a spendthrift

754
01:48:14,955 --> 01:48:17,287
You want money for clothes

755
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:21,224
Must you treat me like a bank?
- I treat you as my own, buddy.

756
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:24,759
What's wrong with your body?
You've lost weight!

757
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,933
You used to look like a wrestler!

758
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:35,438
All because we eat in the hotels...
sleep at unearthly hours!

759
01:48:35,576 --> 01:48:39,273
This isn't any life, is it?
We have no system at all!

760
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:44,784
I want you to get a glass of lassi

761
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:48,450
You must get pancakes for breakfast.
As for lunch...

762
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:54,787
you deserve the best
of delicacies!

763
01:48:55,395 --> 01:48:58,455
Are you turning a cook?
- Stop kidding!

764
01:48:58,732 --> 01:49:01,758
I want you to settle down.

765
01:49:02,002 --> 01:49:06,769
Yes. It's simple. With the money,
I'll summon a priest...

766
01:49:07,007 --> 01:49:11,603
buy a mangalsutra and take the
vows with a band playing for us.

767
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:14,613
The moment I'm married,
you'll be settled.

768
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:18,113
I get it. You plan on getting

769
01:49:19,686 --> 01:49:23,782
Radha!
- You nut! Are you crazy?

770
01:49:24,191 --> 01:49:26,455
It's 4 days since you've met

771
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:29,829
That fraud of a girl...
- Don't start that again!

772
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:32,827
She respects you so very much.

773
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,333
I won't spend a penny for

774
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:41,174
Really? Is that decision final?
- Absolutely final!

775
01:49:44,745 --> 01:49:49,682
Friends! Look at this man!

776
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:54,679
Shankar Shahne!
He calls himself my best friend!

777
01:49:55,088 --> 01:49:57,522
But he won't spend a penny
on my welfare!

778
01:49:57,758 --> 01:50:00,522
Actually, it's more
his welfare than mine!

779
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:03,354
Who's going to drink the lassi?
Him!

780
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:05,996
Who's going to have the pancakes?
Him!

781
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,733
But he won't spend a penny!

782
01:50:08,802 --> 01:50:13,239
"I know my friends now...
they've all drifted"

783
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,744
Listen, clown!
Put a silencer on your mouth!

784
01:50:25,152 --> 01:50:27,086
Take that!

785
01:50:29,323 --> 01:50:33,760
He's a real friend, you know!
Bravo!

786
01:50:34,528 --> 01:50:36,962
The wedding's at the Shiv temple

787
01:50:37,197 --> 01:50:42,464
Go and hang if you wish to!
I won't come to watch the farce!

788
01:50:42,703 --> 01:50:44,364
You will, of course.
- No, I won't.

789
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:47,806
You will, of course!

790
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:51,309
I won't come, you jester!

791
01:50:51,778 --> 01:50:54,975
C'mon...!
- Where Are We going?

792
01:50:55,215 --> 01:50:57,581
What are the new clothes
and everything else for?

793
01:50:57,718 --> 01:50:59,652
You'll know in a moment.

794
01:51:22,209 --> 01:51:23,972
Is there a wedding?
- Yes.

795
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:27,145
Whose is it?
- A bride and a bridegroom's.

796
01:51:27,281 --> 01:51:30,478
Who are they?

797
01:51:30,717 --> 01:51:34,483
C'mon!
- I'm tired!

798
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:40,326
Shankar! My friend!

799
01:51:41,928 --> 01:51:45,989
I knew you'd come!
You couldn't keep away! C'mon!

800
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:49,368
Shankar's here, Radha!

801
01:51:49,603 --> 01:51:52,037
How would I ever marry
without Shankar around?

802
01:51:54,775 --> 01:51:59,371
Your marriage?
Whom are you marrying?

803
01:51:59,613 --> 01:52:01,478
Shocked, aren't you?

804
01:52:02,215 --> 01:52:04,479
I'm marrying you, you silly girl!
Who else?

805
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:09,985
Come here and take a look!

806
01:52:10,223 --> 01:52:12,657
That band, the rose petals

807
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:18,663
We're going to be one forever.
- What joke is this, Kishan?!

808
01:52:18,932 --> 01:52:24,370
This is no joke...
I will marry you, Radha. Really!

809
01:52:24,938 --> 01:52:26,872
Come... get started, priest.

810
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:35,206
Wait... look at what
I've got for you.

811
01:52:38,018 --> 01:52:41,476
Gawd! Aren't you beautiful?!

812
01:52:42,622 --> 01:52:43,884
What say, buddy?

813
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:46,316
Sit down, darling...
Sit down, Shankar.

814
01:52:47,494 --> 01:52:52,898
Start the ceremony, priest.

815
01:52:53,667 --> 01:52:57,603
She is an orphan like me.

816
01:52:58,338 --> 01:53:00,863
If there's anyone we have,
it's my friend, Shankar.

817
01:53:01,441 --> 01:53:05,537
You will give Radha away, Shankar.

818
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:22,594
No!

819
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:27,260
What happened, Radha?!

820
01:53:28,668 --> 01:53:33,105
I can't get into this marriage.
I can't marry!

821
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:37,276
But... how can you

822
01:53:37,677 --> 01:53:41,943
We love each other!
- I don't love anyone!

823
01:53:42,682 --> 01:53:48,279
I'm only capable of hating!

824
01:53:49,523 --> 01:53:53,892
But you're in love with me, Radha!
- I had lied to you!

825
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:57,496
That was a game I was playing!
It was just a pretence!

826
01:53:58,732 --> 01:54:01,599
Let go of my hand!

827
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:35,998
What did you say? You have

828
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:37,502
You only toyed with him!

829
01:54:42,409 --> 01:54:45,845
I've never seen Kishan shed tears.

830
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:49,173
I always found him laughing

831
01:54:49,583 --> 01:54:53,349
But you've made him cry today!
Why? Why did you do it?!

832
01:54:53,587 --> 01:54:55,680
Tell me, or I'll wring your neck!

833
01:54:56,590 --> 01:55:02,119
Sure! Go ahead!
But you can't kill the dead!

834
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:05,493
You will only bury a corpse!

835
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:10,499
Do you have the courage to
know why I did that? So listen!

836
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:14,332
My name is Rupa... not Radha.

837
01:55:16,076 --> 01:55:18,340
I'm from Chandanpur.

838
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:25,680
I used to have a world of my own;
I had my dear ones, too.

839
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:30,181
Do you know what was

840
01:55:46,473 --> 01:55:50,409
This is my true story.

841
01:55:51,478 --> 01:55:55,744
I got a new lease of life
only to destroy Gujjar Singh.

842
01:55:57,484 --> 01:56:01,352
The two of you are the

843
01:56:02,756 --> 01:56:07,022
You are the only ones
who can lend strength...

844
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:10,729
to a woman's frail arms.

845
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:18,393
That's nature for you.
And the Goddess's boon, too.

846
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:23,572
You will help me...
won't you?

847
01:56:26,646 --> 01:56:31,083
Lies! You are lying!

848
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:37,586
You are lying! She's lying!

849
01:56:37,824 --> 01:56:40,793
She fabricates a new lie

850
01:56:41,027 --> 01:56:45,430
She gives us those sob-stories!
She's a cobra!

851
01:56:45,865 --> 01:56:46,422
A cobra who stings hearts

852
01:56:50,537 --> 01:56:52,801
And she sets out to look

853
01:56:53,873 --> 01:56:57,138
Everything about her is a betrayal!

854
01:56:58,712 --> 01:57:03,740
You were right, Shankar!
Women are unfaithful!

855
01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:12,587
She was toying with me...

856
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:20,598
You've always wanted me to

857
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:27,139
So take me away from her...
Faraway... C'mon!

858
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:31,806
No, Kishan! She isn't lying now.

859
01:57:33,546 --> 01:57:36,140
What? You're saying that?

860
01:57:36,383 --> 01:57:40,649
Yes! She's speaking the

861
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:44,756
She spoke from the depths
of her heart today.

862
01:57:46,926 --> 01:57:50,987
You have been subjected to

863
01:57:52,766 --> 01:57:56,167
But let me tell you something.
God, who created this world...

864
01:57:57,771 --> 01:58:02,140
opens many doors for man,

865
01:58:03,209 --> 01:58:10,138
Even in the darkness of despair,

866
01:58:11,718 --> 01:58:15,484
We will tread the path
God has shown you.

867
01:58:16,222 --> 01:58:20,158
We will help you. We will

868
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:25,664
What're you talking about?!
You're falling for her yarn?!

869
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:31,533
She is a cheat! She's lying!

870
01:58:32,272 --> 01:58:35,867
It becomes our duty

871
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:38,543
We must go with her, Kishan.

872
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:42,877
I won't give her any help!

873
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:45,380
I will go with her,

874
01:58:50,123 --> 01:58:52,057
This is what women are!

875
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:54,885
They trap another, even as
they stand exposed before one!

876
01:58:55,161 --> 01:58:57,595
What nonsense are you

877
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:02,028
It's not only a husband or a
lover who protects a woman.

878
01:59:02,602 --> 01:59:06,038
There's another facet to man...
that of a brother!

879
01:59:09,943 --> 01:59:15,381
I'm your brother now, Rupa.

880
01:59:25,792 --> 01:59:29,228
You're not in your senses!

881
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:32,389
Listen to me! Come along!

882
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:35,767
Only Rupa will

883
01:59:41,508 --> 01:59:47,105
Very well. I'll go my way then.

884
01:59:48,181 --> 01:59:50,115
Never to meet you again!

885
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:54,217
Think it over! You're breaking
your relationship with me!

886
01:59:55,855 --> 01:59:59,291
No, friend.
I'm not breaking any ties.

887
02:00:07,901 --> 02:00:12,338
He's leaving... stop him!
Please stop him!

888
02:00:12,906 --> 02:00:18,503
Let him go. He won't stop now.

889
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:52,073
I'm alive, Bulbul...
Look, I'm alive!

890
02:00:52,812 --> 02:00:56,578
I know it. The whole village
knows that you're alive.

891
02:00:57,483 --> 02:01:04,013
But... why have you returned?
- Are you saying that, Bulbul?!

892
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:10,059
Yes. Do you know what I mean?

893
02:01:10,797 --> 02:01:13,061
His men come here every day

894
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:18,237
He has terrorised the village.
If we don't hand you over to him...

895
02:01:18,638 --> 02:01:23,405
They'll set us afire!

896
02:01:24,811 --> 02:01:28,577
You don't know.

897
02:01:28,982 --> 02:01:34,079
We've been in mourning because
Gujjar has been terrifying us.

898
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:38,256
Why've you returned, dear?

899
02:01:38,391 --> 02:01:40,757
Go away, or else that

900
02:01:41,361 --> 02:01:44,922
You shouldn't have returned...
Go away from this hell! Go on!

901
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:49,601
No, teacher.

902
02:01:51,537 --> 02:01:53,471
Not to run away.

903
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:58,401
How will you face him?
- I'm here to destroy him!

904
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:00,408
What are you blabbering about?

905
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:04,916
You? You will take on the
mighty Gujjar, will you?!

906
02:02:05,318 --> 02:02:06,910
Don't you know what
Gujjar has said?

907
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:10,418
He will kill us all

908
02:02:10,657 --> 02:02:13,421
We have nothing to do
with your revenge, girl!

909
02:02:14,027 --> 02:02:17,087
This obsession of yours
will spell doom for us!

910
02:02:17,864 --> 02:02:20,799
Not a word from you!
Chief...

911
02:02:21,868 --> 02:02:24,132
throw her out!

912
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:31,977
Please, Roopa... Go away.

913
02:02:42,555 --> 02:02:48,494
You're back, Rupa!
You're back!

914
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:59,970
Where is Gopal?
...where is he?

915
02:03:01,874 --> 02:03:03,808
The two of you have

916
02:03:04,544 --> 02:03:08,310
Stop it now... and tell me.
Where've you hidden Gopal?

917
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:12,143
Father! Gujjar's men

918
02:03:13,653 --> 02:03:17,214
They've come for you, Rupa!

919
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:20,985
No!
- Be sensible, Rupa.

920
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:22,818
They must be carrying weapons.

921
02:03:23,096 --> 02:03:25,360
Go and hide, Rupa...

922
02:03:45,618 --> 02:03:49,384
Hey, chief!

923
02:03:49,622 --> 02:03:53,058
No, sir... we have no news!

924
02:03:53,659 --> 02:03:58,426
Tell us the truth, merchant!
Or we'll set your shop on fire!

925
02:04:02,335 --> 02:04:05,532
No, sir... we have no news!

926
02:04:05,772 --> 02:04:11,210
I'll tell you...!

927
02:04:11,611 --> 02:04:13,545
I know it!

928
02:04:13,946 --> 02:04:15,880
Where is she?
- She's mad, sir...

929
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:20,384
I'll tell you!
- Where is Rupa?

930
02:04:21,954 --> 02:04:28,382
First tell me where my son is.
Where is Gopal?

931
02:04:29,495 --> 02:04:33,761
Do you want to know?

932
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:37,268
Gujjar made a sieve out of...

933
02:04:37,403 --> 02:04:41,601
his little body! He's dead!

934
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:48,578
Bitch!
- No...

935
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:55,615
Don't hit her, please!
She's mentally ill!

936
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:05,259
Those who inflict atrocities on

937
02:05:05,665 --> 02:05:08,600
And beasts that get out of
control, ought to be shot!

938
02:05:53,246 --> 02:05:56,010
You're not hurt, are you?

939
02:06:01,687 --> 02:06:04,952
What have you done?
What the hell have you done?!

940
02:06:05,691 --> 02:06:07,784
You have killed Gujjar's men!

941
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:13,297
Rupa! What harbinger of death
have you brought with you?

942
02:06:13,566 --> 02:06:18,663
Who's this man you've brought?
- Haven't you recognised him?

943
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:25,336
It's my brother, Ram!
My brother, Ram!

944
02:06:25,611 --> 02:06:29,843
See? A stranger is
willing to protect us!

945
02:06:30,416 --> 02:06:34,853
And you, our fathers and brothers,
are squirming like cowards!

946
02:06:36,088 --> 02:06:41,856
I might not have the strength,
brother. But I have the spirit.

947
02:06:42,628 --> 02:06:46,029
I'm with you!
- You're not alone, Bulbul!

948
02:06:46,199 --> 02:06:50,067
I'm with you too! Women of this
country are no less than men!

949
02:06:50,303 --> 02:06:54,569
Praise the women!

950
02:06:54,974 --> 02:07:00,344
Hear, hear! An army of eunuchs and
women will now fight Gujjar!

951
02:07:01,147 --> 02:07:04,674
Shut up! Whom have you
called an eunuch?

952
02:07:05,251 --> 02:07:10,348
Don't you think I'm a man?
And what man are you!

953
02:07:10,756 --> 02:07:12,690
You can't save your own
women and children...

954
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:18,522
you'd rather wear those anklets
and dance like eunuchs!

955
02:07:18,798 --> 02:07:22,199
What fools are you
talking to?

956
02:07:22,802 --> 02:07:26,738
I swear it!
They'll die the death of dogs!

957
02:07:27,139 --> 02:07:31,075
Let's get rid of the bodies, Chief.
There're going to be many more.

958
02:07:35,815 --> 02:07:39,751
Do not lose hope, Rupa. When we
arrived, there were just two of us.

959
02:07:40,653 --> 02:07:42,587
But we have found friends now.

960
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:46,754
We had no guns...
but we have some now.

961
02:07:47,526 --> 02:07:49,460
Our goal is not far away now.

962
02:07:50,696 --> 02:07:54,598
Yes. The goal is not very far.

963
02:07:55,868 --> 02:07:58,132
We're inching towards it.

964
02:07:59,538 --> 02:08:03,736
We're all here together...
except him.

965
02:08:12,151 --> 02:08:16,417
"What have you done, Rupa?
You've played with his feelings!"

966
02:08:17,657 --> 02:08:21,423
"Don't you know it's a sin to
break someone's heart?"

967
02:08:22,194 --> 02:08:24,253
You have committed the sin

968
02:08:25,197 --> 02:08:27,791
"You have caused that
carefree man a lot of anguish"

969
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:31,799
"lmagine what he must
be going through"

970
02:08:32,204 --> 02:08:35,469
"What sufferings must he
be facing... all because of you"

971
02:08:36,208 --> 02:08:42,477
"But why must I think of all that?
Why get carried away in emotions?"

972
02:08:44,216 --> 02:08:46,707
"Have I fallen in love...
have I?"

973
02:14:09,608 --> 02:14:15,205
"Be it a heart or glass...
it eventually break"

974
02:14:20,285 --> 02:14:24,881
"There's always a slip between
the cup and the lip"

975
02:14:27,459 --> 02:14:30,622
Repeat! I want another bottle!

976
02:14:30,796 --> 02:14:36,234
Another bottle? Looks like
you've been badly jilted!

977
02:14:39,171 --> 02:14:43,437
"It was with great humiliation
that I left her place"

978
02:14:49,181 --> 02:14:53,277
I was always in love with her...

979
02:14:54,687 --> 02:14:56,621
and yet, she was unfaithful

980
02:15:01,627 --> 02:15:06,894
"Like the one whom the breeze
ardently guards..."

981
02:15:09,668 --> 02:15:14,935
"how can anyone extinguish
a lamp that the Lord protects?"

982
02:15:18,844 --> 02:15:21,938
Shake the Kutab Minar...

983
02:15:23,348 --> 02:15:26,283
if you can, O host

984
02:15:28,687 --> 02:15:32,282
If not, sit here with me...

985
02:15:32,858 --> 02:15:37,955
"have a couple of drinks
and watch Kutab Minar sway"

986
02:15:38,397 --> 02:15:43,664
Fantastic! Excellent!

987
02:15:47,740 --> 02:15:50,834
Kishan Kumar, the actor!

988
02:15:53,946 --> 02:15:58,007
Not Pakoda Singh, my boy!
It's Pakkad Singh!

989
02:15:58,417 --> 02:16:00,282
That's it, actually.

990
02:16:01,854 --> 02:16:07,622
What are you doing here?
Where's your partner?

991
02:16:08,227 --> 02:16:13,460
"My friend is no longer a friend;
my love is no longer my love"

992
02:16:15,067 --> 02:16:19,470
"I have nothing to do anymore
except drink"

993
02:16:22,741 --> 02:16:25,676
And what are you doing here at
the liquor-den, Pakoda Singh?

994
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:30,006
It's Pakkad Singh!
- Yes. That's right.

995
02:16:30,415 --> 02:16:32,349
I'm no longer an inspector.

996
02:16:33,085 --> 02:16:36,680
The Commissioner took my uniform
away! He has suspended me!

997
02:16:36,922 --> 02:16:39,516
Suspended? What for?

998
02:16:40,259 --> 02:16:43,695
I locked up a guy thinking
he was a terrorist.

999
02:16:44,429 --> 02:16:46,693
He turned out to be the
Commissioner's brother-in-law!

1000
02:16:46,965 --> 02:16:51,527
Really? You locked up
his brother-in-law?!

1001
02:16:52,471 --> 02:16:57,568
What'll you do now, Pakoda Singh?
- Damn it! It's Pakkad Singh!

1002
02:16:58,811 --> 02:17:04,010
I won't give up easily!
I'll prove it to the Commissioner...

1003
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:07,514
that I can nab a real
terrorist someday!

1004
02:17:07,753 --> 02:17:13,020
Or I'm not Pakoda Singh!
- Damn it! It's Pakkad Singh!

1005
02:17:13,258 --> 02:17:14,953
Did I say Pakoda?
- Yes.

1006
02:17:15,093 --> 02:17:17,027
I'm going crazy!

1007
02:17:17,930 --> 02:17:24,233
Should I get my hands on a terrorist
like Gujjar Singh someday...

1008
02:17:24,970 --> 02:17:28,064
I'll be a Commissioner
directly!

1009
02:17:30,309 --> 02:17:34,075
What was that?
What was the name?

1010
02:17:34,246 --> 02:17:39,582
Gujjar Singh! He killed a minister
at Chandanpur some days ago.

1011
02:17:39,818 --> 02:17:42,753
That's the one!
- Gujjar Singh!

1012
02:17:44,156 --> 02:17:48,752
Which means she spoke the truth!
- Who spoke what?

1013
02:17:50,829 --> 02:17:54,765
Where exactly is Chandanpur?
- It's 500 kms. Away.

1014
02:17:55,534 --> 02:17:57,468
Is Gujjar Singh a bandit?

1015
02:17:57,870 --> 02:18:01,067
The Government has announced a
reward of 10 million on his head.

1016
02:18:01,807 --> 02:18:04,071
Now tell me something.

1017
02:18:04,877 --> 02:18:07,402
Why did you sober down,
the moment you heard of Gujjar?

1018
02:18:08,146 --> 02:18:10,580
You don't know where
he is, do you?

1019
02:18:40,212 --> 02:18:44,308
Where is Rupa?
Tell me! Speak up!

1020
02:18:52,557 --> 02:18:54,821
Where is she?

1021
02:18:57,562 --> 02:19:00,759
Let him go!

1022
02:19:01,199 --> 02:19:04,464
Are you human, Godzilla?!
To hell with you!

1023
02:19:23,388 --> 02:19:26,824
Hey, actor!
Save me from this monster!

1024
02:19:36,601 --> 02:19:39,035
The bloody dino from
Jurassic Park!

1025
02:19:39,271 --> 02:19:42,365
Who the hell is he?
- He's Gujjar's man.

1026
02:19:45,277 --> 02:19:48,713
So I'm going to be promoted

1027
02:19:50,615 --> 02:19:53,550
Where can I find Gujjar?
- In Chandanpur village.

1028
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:59,716
So you have the address!

1029
02:20:00,625 --> 02:20:04,391
Shut up! No one can stop me

1030
02:20:04,629 --> 02:20:07,598
But I'm terribly hungry.
- Eat the apples in the truck.

1031
02:20:07,733 --> 02:20:10,725
Are you carrying apples?
Excellent!

1032
02:20:13,672 --> 02:20:16,937
This looks like a custard-apple!
Great...

1033
02:21:07,025 --> 02:21:10,290
Rupa! So you're back, eh?

1034
02:21:12,397 --> 02:21:14,627
You have returned
to destroy Gujjar!

1035
02:21:16,735 --> 02:21:21,832
But where is your army?
Let me see your army too!

1036
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:43,091
Sing glories of the Lord!

1037
02:22:26,638 --> 02:22:27,570
Brother!

1038
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:01,732
Brother!

1039
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:05,576
Brother? You have yet
another brother, do you?!

1040
02:23:09,981 --> 02:23:14,918
Brother indeed!
Give me the belt!

1041
02:23:20,825 --> 02:23:23,089
Brother, are you?

1042
02:23:24,496 --> 02:23:26,464
Won't you perform the
duties of a brother then?

1043
02:23:27,199 --> 02:23:29,133
Won't you get beaten up
for your sister?!

1044
02:23:31,136 --> 02:23:32,103
No... Don't!

1045
02:23:37,375 --> 02:23:41,812
Brother, eh?
- No! Don't hit him!

1046
02:23:55,393 --> 02:23:57,190
Hang the bastard!
Break his neck!

1047
02:24:07,205 --> 02:24:08,797
Damn you, you bastards!

1048
02:24:59,024 --> 02:25:01,151
Are you okay, Kishen?
Show me your wound!

1049
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:05,825
What you did was worse than
this wound! You walked out on me!

1050
02:25:06,598 --> 02:25:08,828
What would've happened of you
had I not come on time today?

1051
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:12,501
Nothing! Can anyone do harm to
Shankar till Kishan is alive?

1052
02:25:13,438 --> 02:25:16,703
I knew you would come!
- Sure! You know everything!

1053
02:25:17,275 --> 02:25:19,869
You're a smart-ass, aren't you?
Bloody ass!

1054
02:25:21,112 --> 02:25:25,048
You look beautiful, wrestler!
What's your name?

1055
02:25:26,284 --> 02:25:29,048
Bulbul.
- Bulbul? Let's embrace!

1056
02:25:33,792 --> 02:25:35,726
Come here...

1057
02:25:43,335 --> 02:25:46,930
Nothing happens to me
when I embrace you.

1058
02:25:47,339 --> 02:25:49,933
Why do the bells ring
when I embrace him?

1059
02:25:50,342 --> 02:25:54,278
Inspector! What do you expect
when you embrace a girl?

1060
02:25:56,348 --> 02:25:59,681
Is she a girl? Really?
- What else?

1061
02:25:59,851 --> 02:26:05,721
Of course!
- Bulbul! Entangle Pakkad!

1062
02:26:11,096 --> 02:26:13,894
Sit here and take off your jacket.
Show me the wound.

1063
02:26:14,165 --> 02:26:17,931
It's okay. It's not serious.
- But you've been shot!

1064
02:26:18,069 --> 02:26:22,938
Let me see the wound...
- Don't touch me!

1065
02:26:23,675 --> 02:26:27,441
Try the false sympathy on someone
else... it won't work on me anymore!

1066
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:33,116
You pretended to be in

1067
02:26:34,018 --> 02:26:37,454
So you'd reach your goal and
have your enemy at your feet?

1068
02:26:38,356 --> 02:26:42,292
Okay. I'm crazy. And I will
fulfill my duty as a lover.

1069
02:26:42,861 --> 02:26:44,795
I will actually take
you to your goal.

1070
02:26:45,697 --> 02:26:47,961
But I will never look back
at you again!

1071
02:26:50,068 --> 02:26:52,502
And don't be under the illusion
that I came here for you... no!

1072
02:26:53,405 --> 02:26:56,499
I've come here for my friend...
my best friend!

1073
02:27:01,846 --> 02:27:05,282
He's lying! He has come here
only for you, Rupa.

1074
02:27:06,684 --> 02:27:08,618
I know him well!

1075
02:27:09,354 --> 02:27:12,619
Know something?
He possesses a heart of gold.

1076
02:27:13,691 --> 02:27:15,625
You'll never find anyone
like him again.

1077
02:27:17,028 --> 02:27:19,462
I know, you're burning
in the fires of hatred.

1078
02:27:21,399 --> 02:27:25,665
But somewhere in your heart...
you must give love a chance.

1079
02:27:27,071 --> 02:27:31,508
Okay?
...Pyare! Listen!

1080
02:27:32,243 --> 02:27:37,510
You pretended to love me
so you'd find your goal!

1081
02:27:37,749 --> 02:27:40,013
I'm crazy. As a lover
I will fulfill my duty!

1082
02:27:40,418 --> 02:27:44,684
I will take you to your goal. But
I'll never look back at you again!

1083
02:27:46,257 --> 02:27:48,691
Tell us!
Where will we find Gujjar?

1084
02:27:50,762 --> 02:27:54,528
Terrorists like us never
stay at one place.

1085
02:27:55,633 --> 02:28:00,127
Gujjar has no
fixed place either.

1086
02:28:01,072 --> 02:28:03,836
He keeps changing his
place and disguises.

1087
02:28:04,909 --> 02:28:08,675
He spends the night somewhere,
and is elsewhere in the morning.

1088
02:28:09,747 --> 02:28:11,681
You can't find Gujjar!

1089
02:28:12,250 --> 02:28:17,688
He's a tiger you will find only
when he's out hunting for prey.

1090
02:28:19,591 --> 02:28:22,355
He's no tiger. He's a jackal
in a tiger's garb.

1091
02:28:23,428 --> 02:28:25,692
He attacks only when there is a
crowd... not when someone's alone.

1092
02:28:27,799 --> 02:28:30,734
He'll attack when there's a fair.
- A fair?

1093
02:28:33,304 --> 02:28:35,397
Should you want to
hunt Gujjar down...

1094
02:28:36,641 --> 02:28:39,576
you must again organise
a fair in this village.

1095
02:28:39,811 --> 02:28:45,579
A fair?!
- Yes. Are you folks willing?

1096
02:29:06,638 --> 02:29:10,039
They have rebelled, Gujjar!

1097
02:29:10,475 --> 02:29:12,409
They have ignited the fire

1098
02:29:12,544 --> 02:29:15,069
but their fires
still aren't out!

1099
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:19,746
They're out to use our arms
and ammunition against us!

1100
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:23,746
They built a higher effigy
for you than that of Ravana...

1101
02:29:23,888 --> 02:29:26,755
and made a sieve
in it with bullets!

1102
02:29:26,991 --> 02:29:32,258
Do you know what trap the fox
has laid to trap the tiger?

1103
02:29:32,530 --> 02:29:34,521
The fair! They will organise
a fair in Chandanpur!

1104
02:29:38,202 --> 02:29:42,798
There's going to be another
fair in Chandanpur! A fair!

1105
02:36:06,691 --> 02:36:08,386
The bastard is here!

1106
02:36:53,704 --> 02:36:55,137
Gujjar has been hit!
Let's go!

1107
02:37:01,345 --> 02:37:03,279
Let's go!

1108
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:46,857
Don't let him escape!

1109
02:37:59,270 --> 02:38:02,967
Get him! Don't let him escape!

1110
02:39:26,824 --> 02:39:28,257
No!

1111
02:40:06,497 --> 02:40:08,158
Don't, Gujjar!

1112
02:40:08,299 --> 02:40:14,169
You are my enemy!
Don't hit them! Don't!

1113
02:40:16,574 --> 02:40:21,011
So whom will I thrash?
Whom? You?!

1114
02:40:25,282 --> 02:40:28,046
Gujjar, you coward! You raise
your hand on a woman!

1115
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:33,214
Right! I mustn't
hit a woman.

1116
02:40:33,557 --> 02:40:34,888
No!

1117
02:40:35,526 --> 02:40:40,225
Remember what I
had told you, Rupa?

1118
02:40:41,465 --> 02:40:46,903
You will never be anyone's sister
again... nor anyone's wife!

1119
02:40:50,474 --> 02:40:55,070
You'll only be a whore!
My whore!

1120
02:40:55,346 --> 02:40:57,280
No!

1121
02:41:12,963 --> 02:41:14,897
No, Shankar...

1122
02:41:17,034 --> 02:41:20,902
Brother! No! Don't!

1123
02:41:31,015 --> 02:41:32,573
Let me go!

1124
02:41:34,418 --> 02:41:37,785
No...
- Well?

1125
02:41:39,023 --> 02:41:42,618
A brother and a lover, eh?

1126
02:41:45,029 --> 02:41:46,963
Your lover, isn't he?

1127
02:41:47,364 --> 02:41:48,797
Hang the bastard!

1128
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:58,304
The lover boy!
And the love!

1129
02:41:59,576 --> 02:42:01,737
You value your chastity, lady,
isn't it?

1130
02:42:02,846 --> 02:42:04,780
And you even staked
your life for that!

1131
02:42:05,349 --> 02:42:07,112
I want to see now...

1132
02:42:07,351 --> 02:42:12,948
if your honour is more precious
than your love!

1133
02:42:24,535 --> 02:42:27,629
Your love it is!
- Gujjar! No!

1134
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:33,976
I'll have your blood, you swine!
Leave her alone!

1135
02:42:35,746 --> 02:42:37,008
That's love!

1136
02:42:38,148 --> 02:42:39,080
No!

1137
02:42:44,288 --> 02:42:45,220
Brother!

1138
02:42:49,159 --> 02:42:50,353
Brother!

1139
02:45:15,839 --> 02:45:20,105
Praise the Lord!

1140
02:46:04,221 --> 02:46:08,817
See, Gujjar?
You are at my feet.

1141
02:46:10,394 --> 02:46:13,659
I have won, Gujjar...
and you have lost!

1142
02:46:15,732 --> 02:46:18,826
Because it's always God who
triumphs... not the devil!

1143
02:46:19,570 --> 02:46:23,666
You said I'd never
find a brother!

1144
02:46:24,775 --> 02:46:27,835
Here's my brother!
He has returned for good!

1145
02:46:28,545 --> 02:46:33,380
You also said I could
never be anyone's wife!

1146
02:46:33,951 --> 02:46:36,545
You are wrong, Gujjar!
You have been proved wrong!

1147
02:46:37,454 --> 02:46:39,888
Here's my man!

1148
02:46:43,226 --> 02:46:48,220
Yes, Kishan! I say this today
in front of my enemy...

1149
02:46:49,633 --> 02:46:51,897
and my village! You're the
only one I have loved!

1150
02:46:54,571 --> 02:46:56,903
But you hate me now...
don't you?

1151
02:46:58,308 --> 02:47:00,833
What I did with you
was very bad!

1152
02:47:02,279 --> 02:47:04,213
No human being has the right...

1153
02:47:04,615 --> 02:47:10,554
to toy with another's emotions
to reach his goal and destination!

1154
02:47:11,288 --> 02:47:13,222
Because one has
borne atrocities...

1155
02:47:14,958 --> 02:47:16,482
must one inflict
injustice on another?

1156
02:47:18,562 --> 02:47:21,224
You had said you'd lay
my enemy at my feet!

1157
02:47:22,633 --> 02:47:24,066
But you'd never
look back at me again.

1158
02:47:25,702 --> 02:47:27,636
I won't stop you either.

1159
02:47:27,804 --> 02:47:31,240
But once... just once...

1160
02:47:32,509 --> 02:47:34,443
...tell me that you
have forgiven me!
