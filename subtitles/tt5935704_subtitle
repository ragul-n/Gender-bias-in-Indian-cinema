1
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,870
Look at our Commander!

2
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,660
Seems like he's travelled all the way from
Delhi to Gazni only to eat and sleep!

3
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,830
Shareef Pasha, he has come here to get us...

4
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,660
...his intentions are that we attack Delhi together.

5
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,740
Oh Lord, so now the Commander
wants to become the Sultan of Delhi!

6
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,220
Revolt against the Sultanate?!

7
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,620
-This is not a rebellion...

8
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,450
...it's all about our desires.

9
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,660
-Yes!

10
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,450
How long will we serve the Sultanate?

11
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,130
Now I desire to be the Sultan!

12
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,330
Indeed!

13
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,490
Who is this insolent fool?

14
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,210
Marvellous!

15
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,240
Alauddin! What have you brought?

16
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,370
Uncle, you asked me to get it!!

17
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,660
When did I ask you to get an ostrich?

18
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,330
I do not remember.

19
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,200
But Alauddin never forgets.

20
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,240
I respect you so much. You asked for a feather,
I got you an ostrich instead.

21
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,620
Feather?
Oh yes! Now I remember...

22
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,660
Now you remember!

23
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,860
For my beloved Mehru!

24
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,950
Yes, for Mehru!

25
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,660
Mehru!

26
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,450
Mehru!

27
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,990
Mehru!

28
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,500
Yes, Father?

29
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,950
Look what I got for you as a gift.

30
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Allah! An Ostrich!

31
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,700
I really love you a lot, Father!

32
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,330
Me too.

33
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,990
I'd like to reward you
for fulfilling my daughter's wish.

34
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,700
What do you want?

35
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,200
I risked my life to fulfill your wish.

36
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,370
Now, I want your life in return!

37
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,560
No...no...

38
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,010
I want your daughter Mehrunisa to be my wife.

39
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,660
Aren't you clever? For one precious
gift you want another in return.

40
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,910
Everything precious belongs only to Alauddin.

41
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,450
Says who?

42
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,370
Alauddin!

43
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,540
Mehrunisa, daughter of Jalaluddin Khilji...

44
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,330
...do you accept Alauddin Khilji as your husband?

45
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,030
She accepts!

46
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,790
Shareef Pasha, where is the groom?

47
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,790
Tell him that I've called him.

48
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,740
I'll get him right away.

49
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,540
Alauddin!

50
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,700
Alauddin!

51
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,490
What are you doing?
It's your wedding night!

52
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,660
If the Commander finds out,
he will have you beheaded.

53
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,540
Who will tell him?

54
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,580
You?

55
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,700
You won't tell him.
You are my childhood friend!

56
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,580
My confidante.

57
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,660
You will never tell him.

58
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,660
Never.

59
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,330
Never.

60
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,140
Allah!

61
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,120
Alauddin's greed to possess everything precious,
made Mehru and the skies above shudder with fear.

62
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,960
He believed that anything precious
was rightfully his...

63
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,660
...but was unaware,
that thousands of miles away across the oceans...

64
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,790
...lived the most precious beauty on earth...

65
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,610
...the Princess of Singhal.

66
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,560
Your arrow hit it's mark!!

67
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,740
-Is anybody out there?

68
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,290
Is anybody out there?

69
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,990
Wardhan!

70
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,240
What are you doing here at this hour?

71
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,040
Our state guest, King Ratan Singh of Mewar
had set out on a hunt.

72
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,660
It seems he has lost his way in the jungle.

73
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,700
The King has given orders to search for him.

74
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,740
Inform the King, the guest is safe
and is resting in the caves.

75
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,540
I shall.

76
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,160
Everyone back to the Palace!

77
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,330
-Do you know what those pearls meant to me?

78
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,660
-You could've gifted him a few villages instead.

79
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,580
Why did you have to give him that necklace?

80
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,620
What are you trying to say?

81
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,540
I want that necklace back.

82
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,120
-It was gifted to you on our wedding
and you gave it away!

83
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,990
Do not worry,
I'll have a similar necklace made for you.

84
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,370
Would you cross the ocean for those pearls?

85
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,240
-Those pearls were especially brought from Singhal.

86
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,080
-Neither can anyone bring those pearls back...

87
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,430
...nor will I ever get that necklace again.

88
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,790
Have you come to apologize?

89
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,910
Your aim is remarkable.

90
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:21,450
You wounded this hunter instead of the deer.
First with your arrow and now with your eyes!

91
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,000
Our meeting was a coincidence
but sometimes coincidences are beautiful...

92
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,290
...just like this place of yours!

93
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,700
Everything here is so mesmerising.

94
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:39,160
I have been talking for a while,
but we know nothing about each other.

95
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,990
You are Ratan Singh, the King of Mewar.

96
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,540
How do you know?

97
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,370
Because you are our guest.

98
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,080
And that's how you welcome your guest.

99
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,540
What brings you to Singhal?

100
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm here to buy pearls.

101
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,740
Here, you don't buy pearls.
You find them if you're lucky.

102
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,540
Just like I found you.

103
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,830
So tell me about yourself.
Who are you?

104
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,280
What is your name?

105
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,990
Every leaf here knows my name.

106
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,830
I'm sure you'll find out.

107
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,120
She is the Princess of Singhal...

108
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Padmavati.

109
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,620
She has been looking after you
for the past two days.

110
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,950
Padmavati.

111
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,580
My apologies, King Ratan Singh.

112
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,040
Before you could enjoy our hospitality,
you got injured.

113
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,740
My daughter made a grave mistake.

114
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,330
It was not Padmavati's fault,
King Gandharvasen.

115
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,540
I glanced upon her during my hunt.

116
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,330
I followed her and the arrow hit me.

117
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,990
I have come to take you back.

118
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,660
Please return to the Palace.

119
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,490
I have stayed in palaces all my life.

120
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,740
I like the tranquility of the forest.

121
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,830
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay here for a few days more.

122
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,660
King Ratan Singh,
you came here as our state guest...

123
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,700
...but now you're more like family.

124
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,480
I would like you take
pearls back from Singhal and not the wound.

125
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,700
-Pearls from Singhal.

126
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,450
Aren't these the ones you were looking for?

127
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,080
What are you thinking?

128
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,620
Now that you've got what you wanted,
you'll return to Mewar?

129
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,790
I must go back.

130
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,080
You can't leave.

131
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,700
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

132
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,340
Would you come with me to Mewar, Padmavati?

133
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,450
As my wife!

134
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,790
With the blessings of her father,
King Gandharvasen...

135
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,870
Princess Padmavati got married to King Ratan Singh
and left for Chittor.

136
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,500
-All rise!

137
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,870
-King Ratan Singh is arriving in the court.

138
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,630
All hail Queen Padmavati!

139
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,490
All hail King Ratan Singh!

140
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,200
While Chittor celebrated the
arrival of it's new Queen...

141
00:20:51,740 --> 00:21:00,580
Jalaluddin revolted against the Delhi Sultanate
and established the Khilji dynasty.

142
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,700
He declared himself
the new Sultan of Delhi.

143
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,450
Sultan of Delhi, Jalaluddin Khilji...

144
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,830
Glory to him!

145
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,660
But Alauddin had his eyes set on
the precious throne of Delhi too.

146
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,290
The throne looks beautiful from afar,
but don't be deceived.

147
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,410
Along with it comes it's fair share of troubles.

148
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,700
We are surrounded by enemies
but the most immediate threat is from the Mongols.

149
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,620
Sultan, defeating the Mongols
in battle is impossible.

150
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,990
Our army is half their strength.

151
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,120
But our courage is far greater than theirs.

152
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,870
So, will you fight the Mongols?

153
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,350
For the sake of Khiljis I can even fight God.

154
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,290
Well said!

155
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,620
Keep your ambitions in check,
lest you get burried under their weight.

156
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,400
Pardon me, but there's nothing that can
come in the way of Alauddin's ambitions.

157
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,240
I don't want your tall claims,
only victory!

158
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,700
I will fight the Mongols.

159
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,080
Sultan, your belief in me is my victory.

160
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,350
Charge!

161
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,860
Alauddin defeated the Mongols
and won Delhi over.

162
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,830
Meanwhile, Queen Padmavati was
winning hearts in Chittor.

163
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,970
Careful Suraj Baisa. Your days of doingGhoomar (traditional folk dance) are long gone.

164
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,660
You might hurt your back.

165
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,490
Now the new Queen will perform Ghoomar.

166
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,790
My Queen, you must
put up a grand performance.

167
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,620
It sure will Suraj Baisa,
because I will play the drums.

168
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,260
Greetings, My Queen.

169
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,880
Kunwar Baisa, your talkative son
has spoken out of turn again.

170
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,580
Leave alone playing the drums Badal...

171
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,910
...no man except the King can be present
during the Queen's performance.

172
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,200
Son, you can beat the drums
all you want at your wedding.

173
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,290
-All rise for King Ratan Singh.

174
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,870
Are they troubling you, My Queen?

175
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,740
The Royal Guru is expecting you at the temple.

176
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,450
Shall we?

177
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,180
Welcome, My Lord!

178
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,700
Padmavati, meet the Royal Guru
and my mentor, Raghav Chetan.

179
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,530
He's the answer to all our questions.

180
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,400
Please take his blessings.

181
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,110
Your beauty is divine!

182
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Not just beauty, but she's also
blessed with great intelligence.

183
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,570
Hmm...

184
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,780
So what is more important to the new Queen?
Beauty or skill?

185
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,150
Careful My Queen, you're being tested!

186
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,950
Please answer his question.

187
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,400
Skill.

188
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,650
And beauty?

189
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,820
That lies in the eye of the beholder.

190
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,200
Please explain.

191
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,200
Some see God in every object,
while some see God as another object.

192
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,240
-Hmm...

193
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,320
Describe life in three words.

194
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,740
Spirituality, love and sacrifice.

195
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,320
What is love?

196
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,650
A tear of joy falling from God's eye.

197
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,860
What are tears?

198
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,320
The thin line between sorrow and happiness.

199
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,450
What is happiness?

200
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,280
An illusion.

201
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,730
I hear you're well versed in the art of warfare.

202
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,780
Yes.

203
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,110
What is the greatest weapon in the battlefield?
-Courage.

204
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,200
Which is the most difficult moment in life?

205
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,070
Awaiting results after examination.

206
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,880
And the biggest gift?

207
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,400
Blessings!

208
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,100
Come, My Queen.

209
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:30,950
To grace this occasion...

210
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,820
The Queen is arriving.

211
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,360
To play a round of Ghoomar...

212
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:49,150
We welcome you our Queen.

213
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,370
Join us in a round of Ghoomar.

214
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,180
Spin around as we play the Ghoomar.

215
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,070
Your beloved is waiting for you too.

216
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,280
You blush in a new bride's glow.

217
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,570
Your heart skips a beat.

218
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,370
Your anklets tinkle as you walk.

219
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,200
Come, My Queen...

220
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,650
...let's play a round of Ghoomar!

221
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,740
Adorning the veil of love...

222
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,770
...she spins in the dance of Ghoomar.

223
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,320
Without a care in the world...

224
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,520
...she spins in the dance of Ghoomar.

225
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,490
Her beloved is the most special.

226
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:48,740
She spins in the dance of Ghoomar.

227
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,030
I am lucky indeed...

228
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,320
I went to Singhal looking for pearls and found you.

229
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
I am lucky too...

230
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,400
I was hunting for a deer and found a lion instead.

231
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,650
I want to give you every happiness
that you enjoyed in Singhal...

232
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,360
...but I can't give you this one thing...

233
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,740
I cannot give you the ocean in this desert.

234
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,670
Your eyes are deeper than the ocean.

235
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,860
Mewar seems to be growing on you.

236
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,730
Mewar has found a place in my heart.

237
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,610
What happened?

238
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,200
Is someone watching us?

239
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:13,400
Must be the moon,
envious of all your extols.

240
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,610
Who could it be?

241
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,320
I smell sandalwood.

242
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,440
And there is only one person in Chittor
who uses this fragrance.

243
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,450
Why have I been summoned
at this hour, My Lord?

244
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,860
An offender needs to be punished.

245
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,820
Is that all?

246
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,780
This could have waited till morning.

247
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,570
The crime is serious,
the verdict must be given now.

248
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,950
Who is the culprit?

249
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,650
You!

250
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,610
The one whose piousness
Mewar vouches for, is a culprit?

251
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,650
The one who taught you to be
the King you are today, is a culprit?

252
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,150
What is my crime, My Lord?

253
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,200
You dared to pry upon the King
when alone with his Queen.

254
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,200
This is a lie.
What proof do you have?

255
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,210
Sujaan Singh.
- Yes, My Lord.

256
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,970
That wound is from my dagger.
And your blood is all the proof one needs.

257
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,320
I thought you were my mentor, I believed in you.

258
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,530
I thought you were pious, but you
turned out to be a wolf in sheep's guise.

259
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,950
I can sentence you to death right now...

260
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,440
...but killing a Brahmin is against my principles.

261
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,860
Imprison him. The darkness of the dungeon
might teach him some decency.

262
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,650
-Pardon me, My King.
But I would like to say something.

263
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,150
When one's piousness is tainted,
he should be distanced from the land.

264
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,110
There's only one punishment for his crime.

265
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,610
Banishment.

266
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,990
I agree with the Queen.

267
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,150
You question my piousness?

268
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,600
There, I have swallowed this humiliation.

269
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,610
But this fire raging in my heart
will reduce Chittor to ashes.

270
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,740
Before I leave, won't you
touch my feet and take my blessings?

271
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,030
Sujaan Singh.
-Yes, My Lord.

272
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,860
I am going far away from this land.

273
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,140
But if I don't bring Mewar down to it knees...

274
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,900
...then you may assume,
that Raghav Chetan never existed.

275
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,150
He was a mere thought that disappeared in thin air.

276
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,820
Uncle, since you gave the dominion of Kara to
Uncle Alauddin, his attitude has completely changed.

277
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,030
He attacked Deogiri without your permission...

278
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,530
...and instead of returning to Delhi with the loot,
he rode straight to Kara.

279
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,350
I agree with Itaat.

280
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,740
He may one day revolt against you.

281
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,950
While Alauddin wields
his sword for the Sultanate, My dear...

282
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,780
...we sit here and make idle talk.

283
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,870
But Uncle, you should be wary of him...

284
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,970
Alauddin is just a tool to fill the coffers of Delhi.
And that's it.

285
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,740
I will set sail for Kara tomorrow.

286
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,950
And bring back what is rightfully mine.

287
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,320
-Glory be to God!

288
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:56,500
Your beauty is so enchanting,
it has turned these shackles to gold.

289
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:02,590
You will be very happy in my harem, Chitai.

290
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,360
You're a slave, not a King.

291
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,330
You can never make the Princess of Deogiri happy.

292
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,110
Well said!

293
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,900
Such arrogance inspite of all these atrocities!

294
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,030
You have won my heart.

295
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,530
Chief!
-Hmm...

296
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,240
Your plan has succeeded.

297
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,650
Splendid!

298
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,490
You wanted the Sultan
to come to Kara, and he has.

299
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,900
Long live the Khiljis!

300
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,610
-Long live!

301
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,860
Alauddin welcomes the Sultan of Delhi.

302
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,820
Stay blessed!

303
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,900
I am elated, as well as surprised.

304
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,820
What brings you to Kara without prior notice?

305
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,990
That's exactly my question to you.

306
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:02,280
Why have you come to Kara
instead of returning to Delhi with the loot?

307
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,950
So the Sultan doesn't trust me anymore?

308
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,110
I've won all these treasures only for you.

309
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,150
And this stone?

310
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,150
It's precious.

311
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,150
A gift I gave myself.

312
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,400
Glory be to God!

313
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,360
This precious gem belongs in the Sultan's crown.

314
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,320
But don't be disheartened Alauddin.

315
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,980
I've brought a precious gift for you too.

316
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,070
This slave!

317
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,820
Especially bought for you.

318
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,200
He has the guile of a wolf and
the agility of a cheetah.

319
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,900
He will serve you in every way possible.

320
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,450
You can put him to test.

321
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,360
Hmm...

322
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,870
What's the name?

323
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,320
Malik Kafur, Sire.

324
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,780
Not your's. The perfume you're wearing.

325
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,650
Jannat-ul-Firdaus.

326
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,860
What can you do for me?

327
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,650
Anything.

328
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,780
I can give my life for you.

329
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,570
Can you take a life for me?

330
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,950
Yes, Sire.
-Hmm.

331
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,450
Then kill these men.

332
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,720
Kill them?

333
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,100
They are my ministers!

334
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:48,160
Jokes apart.
I want you to march South with your army.

335
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,110
Anything else, Sire?

336
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,650
What have you done?

337
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,590
You wanted me to put him to test.

338
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,410
Uncle, I am really pleased with your gift.

339
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,030
But don't be disheartened.
I have a gift for you too.

340
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,150
Ikhtiyaar!

341
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,800
My dearest Uncle!

342
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,860
Long live the Khiljis!!

343
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,240
Long live!

344
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,990
So finally you did revolt against the Sultanate?

345
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:26,270
History will never forgive you for
murdering my Uncle.

346
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:30,150
What will history say Amir Khusrau?

347
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,650
History will term it the need of the hour.

348
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,570
You're absolutely right.

349
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,320
Itaat, my boy...

350
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,050
...the Sultanate needs fresh blood to expand
it's frontiers and to keep it's people happy.

351
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,990
And that is why I have seized the throne.

352
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,270
And now, Jalaluddin Khilji should be
buried in a manner befitting a Sultan.

353
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,450
Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji...

354
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,280
Long live!

355
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji...

356
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,820
Long live!

357
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,490
I am the new Sultan!

358
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,400
This is the precious stone which
your father took from me...

359
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,360
...and today I took away his throne.

360
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,110
It's the tradition of every Sultanate.

361
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:59,280
There's one more tradition,
to bow before the Sultan.

362
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,780
Hmm...

363
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,990
No...no...

364
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,320
Stand up.

365
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,820
May the Sultan's glory prevail.

366
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,570
Why do you look upset?

367
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,530
You're now the Empress of India!

368
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,570
And your husband...

369
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,030
See.

370
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,280
See what?

371
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,280
This crown?

372
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,490
I've seen it many a times before,
on my father's head.

373
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,110
This crown is unfaithful.

374
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,280
Always changing heads.

375
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,820
From your father's head to mine.
And now on yours!

376
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,670
On this joyous occasion,
make unabashed love to your Sultan.

377
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,570
Now!

378
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,360
Kafur!

379
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,450
Malik Kafur!

380
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,820
Yes, Sire!

381
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,490
Yes, Sire?

382
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,110
Can you hear these strains of flute,
or is it just me?

383
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,570
I do hear it.

384
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,610
Who is playing the flute at this hour?

385
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,500
Should I silence him for good?

386
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,400
No. His notes are precious.
Bring him to me tomorrow.

387
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,530
Yes, Sire.

388
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,920
Any other service?

389
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,880
Exquisite!

390
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,630
Ethereal!

391
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,730
I can conquer everything precious,
except for your talent.

392
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,590
What did you say your name was?
Raghav Chetan.

393
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,260
Whoever you are.
Wherever you've come from...

394
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,090
...now on you will be the pride of my court.

395
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,510
What are you looking at?

396
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,910
Your past!

397
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,600
Ostrich feathers smeared with blood.

398
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,460
A red stone studded crown.

399
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,900
A crown that will rule the world!

400
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,960
Alexander the Great!

401
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,070
You will be the next Alexander!

402
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,670
But this is only possible when she is with you.

403
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,210
Who?

404
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,800
She's an illusion!

405
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,470
A creation of God.
Her face glows like moonlight.

406
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,630
Her luminous beauty radiates far and beyond.

407
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,170
She is the essence of life.

408
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,550
A mere glimpse of her shadow
would make you desire her.

409
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,440
Such beauty can exist only in dreams.

410
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:55,110
I assure you. One look at her and you'll
never be able to get her off your mind.

411
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,670
She will change your destiny.

412
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,590
If you win her over...

413
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,710
...Mewar will be yours!

414
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,590
India will be yours!

415
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,110
The world will be at your feet,
even paradise!

416
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,880
Without her, you'll have nothing.

417
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,130
Whatever she touches, turns to gold!

418
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,800
She will make you immortal!

419
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,590
She is the most precious.
But just as impossible to possess.

420
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,340
What's the name of Alauddin's destiny?

421
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,690
The Queen of Chittor, Padmavati.

422
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,410
Padmavati!

423
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:38,060
Greetings to King Ratan Singh of Mewar
from the Sultan of Delhi.

424
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,510
I send this invitation to you
on the occasion of my birthday.

425
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,420
Please grace the event along with your family.

426
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:50,640
Share a meal and enjoy our hospitality.

427
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,200
So that like other kings...

428
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,170
...you and Mewar stay protected under the sovereignty
of Sikandar-e-Sani (Alexander-the-Second).

429
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,380
Your well-wisher, the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji.

430
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,710
Read it once again.

431
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,570
Greetings from the Sultan...

432
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,380
Please inform your Sultan, we have more steel
in our nerves than in his entire armoury.

433
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,050
We're safe without his refuge.

434
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,630
Long live the Khiljis.
-Hmm.

435
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,040
Sultan, The King of Chittor
has declined your invitation.

436
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,880
Then summon the troops and declare war.

437
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,300
You should fear God, Sultan.

438
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,300
Padmavati is someone's wife.

439
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,840
Malik Kafur, ask the Empress
what will she serve for dinner.

440
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,010
Venison, Kabuli pulao,
korma, aloo bukhara, shahi...

441
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,590
With a feast like that
I've no appetite left for fear.

442
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,010
Hmm?

443
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,010
It's hard to believe,Sikandar-e-Sani will wage war for a woman.

444
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,130
I am done extending my boundaries.
It's time to extend my arms.

445
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,050
A war in the name of beauty!

446
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,800
What's the matter Tejveer?

447
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,760
Why have you rushed to the fort from the frontier?

448
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,590
I have a message.

449
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:50,190
Sultan Alauddin Khilji and his army
are on their way to attack Chittor.

450
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,190
The Khilji army will reach Chittor soon, My Lord.

451
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,130
I know. We will welcome them
in true Rajput manner.

452
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:03,010
Alert the troops
and fill the granaries with supplies.

453
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,760
But the people are scared.
-There is nothing to fear.

454
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:09,800
Gather all women and children from the villages
and bring them inside the fort.

455
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,170
Send a message to all the neighbouring Kingdoms...

456
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,170
...that if we all unite, Alauddin can be defeated.

457
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,210
Otherwise, he will annihilate us one by one.

458
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,340
Yes, My Lord!

459
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,380
My Lord?

460
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,660
Attack!

461
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,860
Malik! Now this war is justified.

462
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,800
Absolutely, Sultan.

463
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:31,670
Commander Ulugh Khan, what is your opinion?
Should we send some of our troops?

464
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,550
Certainly, Sire.

465
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:37,340
But Ulugh Khan, it's impossible
to scale the walls of Chittor.

466
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,260
Whoever tried, has only faced defeat.

467
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,630
Khiljis have never accepted defeat.

468
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,090
Send some troops before sunset.

469
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,260
Let's gauge the ability of these Rajputs.

470
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,260
I don't understand their tactic of
sending a handful of soldiers, My Lord.

471
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,210
With your permission, should we engage them?

472
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,520
Let them come.

473
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,510
You summoned me, Sultan?

474
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,550
It's time to kill you!

475
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,800
Our decision to attack was not correct.

476
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,130
I had warned Ulugh Khan...

477
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:14,840
Let the universe be warned, the Rajput Sun
will soon be eclipsed by the Khilji Crescent.

478
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,130
Pardon me, Sultan.

479
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,630
But passion isn't enough
to break down the walls of Chittor.

480
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,090
This passion is what helped me
conquer half of India.

481
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,050
The walls of Chittor cannot stop me.

482
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,000
But the real question is...

483
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,610
...if Padmavati doesn't turn out
to be as precious then...

484
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:44,410
...the number of soldiers that have died today...

485
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,190
I'll cut you into the same number of pieces!

486
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:55,590
The Sultan is getting hungry.
Bring me food.

487
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,980
-Looks like Alauddin has set up
all of Delhi here, My Lord!

488
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:13,050
This is his strategy.
Show your might and shatter the enemy's morale.

489
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,590
When is Diwali (Festival of Lights)?

490
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,010
Next week, My Lord.

491
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,300
This year's Diwali celebrations
will be so grand...

492
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,880
...that they will lose half the battle
watching us rejoice.

493
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:24,170
Yes, My Lord.

494
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,530
Queen, why are you sitting here all alone?

495
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:25,550
All of Chittor is celebrating Diwali.
Everyone's looking for you.

496
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,800
They have lost their minds!

497
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:32,840
The enemy has us surrounded
and we're celebrating Diwali!

498
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,130
Why do you think of them as our enemy?

499
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:39,590
Think of them as the new guards of Chittor.

500
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:46,070
They can't leave, or come inside,
but can only stand guard.

501
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,340
Long live the Khiljis!
-Hmm.

502
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,340
Sultan, if you're busy we'll come back later.

503
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,840
No, these are some historical records.

504
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,300
I was burning the ones
that don't mention my name.

505
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:08,950
Some of these are
written by you too Khusrau.

506
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,630
But Sire...

507
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:16,010
I want history to remember only me!

508
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,550
Ulugh Khan, have you cut off all
supplies of food and water to Chittor?

509
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,170
Yes, Sire.

510
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,440
Did you block their secret tunnels?
-Yes.

511
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,800
And plundered the neighbouring villages?
-Yes, Sire.

512
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:35,460
Now send a message to all the Rajput kings
that helping Mewar will invite the Sultan's wrath.

513
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,800
Yes, Sire.

514
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,050
Dismissed.

515
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:43,760
Sultan, it's been days since any combat.
The soldiers are getting restless.

516
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,420
But the war is on!

517
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,920
Between their hunger and our patience.

518
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:56,710
But we must motivate our soldiers.
Keep them entertained.

519
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,760
Wrestling!

520
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,510
Announce a wrestling bout.

521
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,840
I will also fight tomorrow.

522
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,380
Let's wrestle!

523
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:06,050
Sultan!

524
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:13,630
Hunting games in the morning,
wrestling in the evening...

525
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,760
Music and debauchery at night!

526
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:19,790
It's a unique way to keep the army's spirits up.

527
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,210
But you must consider, Sultan...

528
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,340
It's been two months since
we've been away from Delhi.

529
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,050
But we're getting closer to Padmavati.

530
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,620
Like the beauties of Egypt...

531
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:40,760
...here's a celestial beauty too
whose heart beats for you.

532
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:12,760
In the land where beauty lies,
beats a heart that yearns for love.

533
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,630
I feel a deep burning desire within.

534
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,670
What news have you brought Sujaan Singh?

535
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,590
When are the troops of other Kingdoms arriving?

536
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:28,670
Every Kingdom has refused to support us.

537
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,630
No one wants enmity with Alauddin.

538
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,760
What should we do now Gora Singh?

539
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,260
Declare war.

540
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,670
My Lord, please reconsider.

541
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,660
The decision is made.
Chittor will fight it's own battle.

542
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,820
Sultan!

543
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,630
Sultan!

544
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:44,540
Wake up, Sultan!

545
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,040
The Rajputs have set all our camps on fire!

546
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,180
Then put out the fire.
Wake me up when it is done.

547
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,840
Let's go, Sultan...
-You fool, my birds!

548
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,670
They are precious!
They shouldn't be harmed.

549
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,630
Stop joking...

550
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,960
Here are your cages!

551
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:40,760
Long live the Khiljis.

552
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,630
The troops are growing restless, Sultan.

553
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:50,580
Our camps, food and other
reserves have burnt to ashes.

554
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,090
The troops are dying of thirst.

555
01:05:55,630 --> 01:06:02,460
I have a request to make, Sire.
If you could meet with the troops once.

556
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,510
Your army is on the verge of mutiny.

557
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,800
We won't stay here any longer.

558
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,150
We will go back to Delhi!

559
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:35,800
Whoever wants to go back, step forward.

560
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,130
Embrace your Sultan and return to Delhi.

561
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,820
Ulugh Khan?

562
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:16,630
We Khiljis saw a dream together.

563
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:21,010
That one day our flag
will soar all over the world.

564
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:26,260
We swore to stand by each other,
come what may.

565
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:34,380
And during these troubled times,
you want to give up!

566
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,300
Then forget our dream!

567
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:53,590
Long live the Khiljis.
-Long live!

568
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:04,340
Sikandar-e-Sani...
-Long live!

569
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,510
My Lord, Greetings on Holi (Festival of Colours)!

570
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:27,050
Wish you the same.

571
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,260
I am just returning from the granary.

572
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,010
We only have a few days' supply left.

573
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:33,300
But this should remain only between us.

574
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,010
Our people shouldn't know.

575
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,210
Our difficulties are growing, My Lord.

576
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,670
Difficulties will also grow for our enemy.

577
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,670
This scorching heat will force
Alauddin to retreat.

578
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,050
Just a few more days.

579
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:53,010
Please enjoy Holi. I'll go and wish
the new Queen on her first Holi here.

580
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,550
Please don't ignore the reality, My Lord.

581
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,210
This is a matter of grave concern.

582
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:03,170
You seem to have forgotten, Gora Singh.

583
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,710
One who braves any situation, is a Rajput.

584
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:13,340
One who dares to walk
on burning embers, is a Rajput.

585
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,890
One who accepts all challenges and
emerges victorious, is a Rajput.

586
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:26,170
The one who fights the enemy
till his last breath, is a Rajput.

587
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,590
Sultan!

588
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:33,880
These people have lost their minds!

589
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:38,340
They celebrate despite the siege.
I see colours flying from the fort!

590
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,850
-Colours are bound to fly in Chittor.
Today is Holi!

591
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:46,460
People colour each other and express their love.

592
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,800
And even embrace their enemies?

593
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:50,170
Yes, Sire.

594
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,760
Then let me play with the enemy too!

595
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:55,330
With colours or blood?

596
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:05,010
Before this weather turns against us,
send a message of truce to the fort.

597
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,090
Truce with Chittor?

598
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:11,050
Why did your face turn pale?
-Absolutely not!

599
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,630
I will deliver this message...

600
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:15,460
Not you, Malik Kafur will go.

601
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:16,630
As you wish.

602
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,170
So today is Holi!

603
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,710
Someone colour me too.

604
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:18,420
The Festival of Colours is here.

605
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,170
I will play Holi with my beloved.

606
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:35,420
And colour him with my love.

607
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,630
Chief, look!

608
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:31,720
Should I knock him down?

609
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,630
Let him come, Badal.

610
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,180
This is Malik Kafur, My Lord.

611
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,880
Alauddin's most trusted.
Some even call him his consort.

612
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,380
Greetings to King Ratan Singh
from the Sultan of Delhi.

613
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:05,760
I've understood that the Rajputs of Mewar
don't bow their heads or swords.

614
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,880
Your determination is truly commendable.

615
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,800
I would like to extend my
hand in friendship towards you.

616
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:17,760
Before returning to Delhi, I would like to
experience Chittor's hospitality.

617
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,470
I hope you will accept my message of truce.

618
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,880
I will definitely meet Alauddin.

619
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,430
Marvellous!
The Sultan will be very pleased!

620
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,760
But before we meet,
I have certain conditions.

621
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,630
We accept all your conditions.

622
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,780
At least listen to the conditions.

623
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:51,510
This proposition could be a conspiracy.

624
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,510
Could be.

625
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,050
Then why invite the Sultan to the fort?

626
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,680
I accepted his proposal and rejected it as well.

627
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,930
How is that?
-I proposed two conditions.

628
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:08,510
First, his army must return to Delhi.

629
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:16,180
Second, if he would like to meet me,
he must come to the fort alone and unarmed.

630
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,720
What if he accepts your conditions?

631
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:23,130
A man who came all the way from Delhi
and spent six months in the scorching heat...

632
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,880
...would definitely accept your conditions.

633
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:26,930
I don't think so.

634
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,590
Lord Ram too never thought that
Raavan will come disguised as a sage.

635
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,550
Greetings, My Lord.
Pardon me for my untimely interruption.

636
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:39,760
What is it Gora Singh?

637
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,630
The Sultan has sent a message.

638
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,720
He has accepted both our conditions.

639
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:50,300
Let him come.

640
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:06,880
Prayer chants...

641
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,430
Is the army ready to return to Delhi?

642
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:16,430
Is the Sultan really sending
the army away from Chittor?

643
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:20,010
Away from Chittor's sight
but not from their land!

644
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,550
Pardon me, Sultan.

645
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:25,340
But entering the enemy's fort
unarmed can be dangerous.

646
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:41,260
Danger!

647
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,510
I accept!

648
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:56,590
Every danger that takes Alauddin closer to Padmavati.

649
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,630
I accept.

650
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,340
I accept.

651
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:28,430
By the way Sultan,
Delhi's throne is in danger too.

652
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,180
Itaat Khan!

653
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:36,340
His eyes are full of hatred for you
and greed for the throne.

654
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,970
He wants to be the next Sultan.

655
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:58,550
Every star wants to be the moon
but never succeeds.

656
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:05,180
Like I am so close to you,
but can never take Padmavati's place.

657
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,660
Queen Padmavati!

658
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,220
Welcome to the fort, Sultan.

659
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,630
King Ratan Singh!

660
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:42,300
Pardon me, but I am the Commander of Mewar's army.

661
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,260
Gora Singh.

662
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,590
So where is your King Ratan Singh hiding?

663
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,800
He's waiting for you inside.

664
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:30,010
I feel elated today!

665
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:34,300
I feel on top of the world today!

666
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,590
Wonderful!

667
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:43,590
Pardon me, but I am overwhelmed to see you.

668
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,300
After months of waiting,
we finally meet!

669
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:53,550
Now that you're here,
how would you like to be welcomed?

670
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,430
Like a dear friend!

671
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,470
I've got you a precious gift!

672
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,970
You're gifting a sword to a friend?

673
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:17,010
It was one of your conditions, wasn't it?
To come alone and unarmed.

674
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:21,010
Here. Now I am unarmed.

675
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,760
I've heard it's very beautiful...

676
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:30,390
...the Fort of Chittor!

677
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,260
God has truly blessed Rajputs with abundance.

678
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:37,050
Abundant skills! Such grandeur!

679
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:39,930
And an unmatched enemy too!

680
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:43,720
Shall we?

681
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:56,050
Prayer before meal.

682
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,180
-Your move.

683
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,380
Sultan!

684
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,430
Hmm...

685
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:55,510
Careful King.
Your Queen is in danger!

686
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,380
There...

687
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,180
I saved my Queen.

688
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,340
Hmm...

689
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:10,590
What are you looking at?

690
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,800
It's almost sundown.

691
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,140
I guess Chittor and Delhi will have to
reconcile in this game as well!

692
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,800
Well then, allow me to take your leave.

693
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:21,760
As you please.

694
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,880
But before I leave you must
introduce me to your family.

695
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:29,590
I've introduced you to everyone.
This is my family.

696
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,720
Yes, of course they are.

697
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,380
But I was referring to the
pride of Chittor...

698
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:35,620
Queen Padmavati.

699
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:42,720
What's wrong?
Was my request unreasonable?

700
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,050
That was a disgraceful thing to say Alauddin.

701
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:54,590
We treat our guests like God in Chittor,
otherwise you would be beheaded right away!

702
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,930
Now the King is in danger too!

703
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,760
Check.

704
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:23,630
Reconsider your decision, My Queen.

705
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,760
I will never agree to this.
This is wrong.

706
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,840
My decision is right for Mewar, Kunwar Baisa.

707
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,840
But, the King...

708
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,680
Which decision of yours is right?

709
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:42,180
-I am aware...
-You may be the Queen of Mewar but...

710
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,180
...you have no right to take political decisions.

711
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,470
It is my right!

712
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:50,340
Especially, if I am the reason
for Chittor to go to war.

713
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:53,380
So let there be a war!
We will fight them in the battlefield.

714
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:57,930
But never make the mistake of taking
these decisions yourself.

715
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,300
Never, My Queen.

716
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,720
You made a mistake too.

717
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,130
When you drew your sword,
you should've beheaded him.

718
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,590
You had your opportunity to change history.

719
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,550
What are you saying, My Queen?

720
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:17,970
You know that I could've never struck
an unarmed guest in the fort.

721
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,050
Even if it's the Devil himself.

722
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:25,630
History can turn its page
but Rajputs don't budge from their principles.

723
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:36,130
Then take your sword and behead me.

724
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:40,180
Rajput principles and honour
will remain intact.

725
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:44,090
No one will ever understand
your decision of showing him your face.

726
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,800
Future generations will hold you accountable.

727
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,180
So let them.

728
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:52,380
If I can save even one life by showing my face,
then I accept this humiliation.

729
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,760
Let me fulfill my duties as the Queen.

730
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,050
Wait here.
The King shall join you shortly.

731
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,680
Here?

732
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,340
Lord Shiva drank poison
to save the world.

733
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,880
Today you're taking this
difficult decision for Mewar.

734
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,590
Keep this with you, My Queen.

735
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,590
This holy smoke will protect you
from the Sultan's evil-eye.

736
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:27,800
King Ratan Singh!

737
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:31,010
A thought crossed my mind while waiting...

738
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:35,930
Gora Singh...

739
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,720
Yes, My Lord.

740
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,720
You may leave, Alauddin.

741
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,970
Yes, I can.

742
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:23,720
But before I return to Delhi,
allow me to show you my hospitality as well.

743
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,760
Tomorrow.

744
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:29,180
I'll be waiting.

745
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:52,840
Keep your sword with you.

746
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:56,550
I've been invited for a meal,
not for battle.

747
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:00,720
A storm is expected outside.
Think about this again.

748
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,050
Do you have to go?

749
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:07,800
Would you like history to remember that
Alauddin Khilji came to Chittor unarmed...

750
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,510
...but King Ratan Singh
was too scared to venture out.

751
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,630
I understand your concern.

752
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:16,590
But he is all alone.
His army has gone back.

753
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,510
But it can come back too.

754
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:27,550
I shall be back before the moon rises.

755
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,050
Hmm.

756
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,780
Sultan!

757
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:16,130
Oh...

758
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:20,720
Welcome, my friend!

759
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,220
I thought you might not
show up in this storm.

760
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:25,720
Storms like these can never stop me.

761
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,340
Of course!

762
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,470
Take a seat.

763
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,260
Here?

764
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,260
Yes.

765
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:39,970
Today is my last day in Chittor.
I am overwhelmed.

766
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,340
Hmm...

767
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:43,760
I have so many memories of this place.

768
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:50,300
Many of my soldiers died here,
right before my eyes.

769
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,380
Do you remember?

770
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,130
The day you stood watching from the fort.

771
01:30:58,510 --> 01:30:59,760
Poor men!

772
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:02,550
Poor Dilnawaz!!

773
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:05,590
My precious little bird!

774
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:13,260
The day you burnt our tents,
he too perished in that fire.

775
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:21,220
Had he been alive, you would have
heard his screams in this storm.

776
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,760
Anyway...

777
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:35,220
I feel a strange connection to this soil.

778
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,550
I want to take it back with me...

779
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,450
...and you too!

780
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:58,180
So this is the Khilji hospitality?

781
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,180
Your principles?

782
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:05,340
I made a mistake
of trusting you again Alauddin.

783
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,760
Even God doesn't trust Alauddin!

784
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:14,300
You broke my trust too!

785
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:18,050
You dropped the curtains so quick that
I couldn't even see the Queen's face.

786
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,510
Now please don't refuse to come with me.

787
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:25,010
Because you're the bait that will
draw Queen Padmavati to Delhi.

788
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:29,340
And if that doesn't happen,
I will take Chittor away from you.

789
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,630
You will take away Chittor?

790
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:35,840
You can take me away from Chittor,
but not my pride.

791
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:39,430
You can steal a diamond,
but not it's sparkle.

792
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:41,680
Imprison him.

793
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:52,930
You may imprison me, but can you
contain the storm rising from Chittor?

794
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:56,630
-Long live the Khiljis!

795
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:58,930
Long live!

796
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:10,550
Greetings, My Lord!

797
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:32,590
My Queen, please return to the Palace.

798
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,620
A storm is gathering outside.

799
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:38,930
And do not worry.
God's blessings are with the King.

800
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,720
He will return safe and sound.

801
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,260
No, Kunwar Baisa.

802
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,430
I will wait here until the moon rises.

803
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:49,250
But the moon won't rise, My Queen.
Tonight is a new moon!

804
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:25,680
My Lord!

805
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:29,470
Gora Singh, are you looking for your King?

806
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,380
The storm blew him away to Delhi.

807
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,720
He's been banished from his own kingdom!

808
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:41,880
So you're the one who
brought Alauddin to Chittor!

809
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:45,590
Traitor!

810
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,680
If you even lay a finger on me,
your King will lose his life.

811
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,380
There's a message for Queen Padmavati.

812
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:57,720
If she wishes to see her King alive,
she must come there!

813
01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:25,800
O Motherland! Give us the strength;
to defend the pride of Rajputs.

814
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:38,500
The hills of Mewar;
uphold our honour now.

815
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:57,570
Hurry! The Queen has called us.

816
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:05,900
Queen Nagmati has asked all the women...

817
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,270
What's this?

818
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,150
Why are you smearing mud on the mirrors?

819
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:14,440
Until the King returns,
I won't see my face in the mirror.

820
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,480
But, My Queen...
-What is it?

821
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:20,020
Queen Nagmati has called
all the women.

822
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:21,690
And you too.

823
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,650
Why have you called us?

824
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:45,650
Go away!

825
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,040
Queen, did you call me?

826
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,190
At least let me grieve in peace!

827
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,940
If you hadn't banished the Royal Guru,
he wouldn't have joined hands with Alauddin.

828
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,360
And Chittor would not be under threat!

829
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:03,020
Today our King is in the enemy's clutches
and it's entirely your fault!

830
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:05,220
Your beauty is to be blamed!

831
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,520
What about the beholder?

832
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:10,940
And his sinful gaze?

833
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:14,770
They too are at fault.
And Mewar is paying the price for that.

834
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:16,900
But you should face punishment too!

835
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:21,270
How to punish someone
who is not at fault?

836
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:25,400
Poison her? Throw her in the well?
Or imprison her?

837
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:29,650
We should accept the Sultan's condition
and send Padmavati there.

838
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:35,940
My Queen! How can you say that
being a woman yourself?

839
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:37,980
Send her there?

840
01:37:38,610 --> 01:37:41,440
Hand her over to the Sultan?
Impossible!

841
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:46,730
If we don't comply, neither our King
nor Mewar will survive!

842
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,400
-My Queen!

843
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,770
If the time comes
for such desperate measures...

844
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:59,360
...then every woman in Chittor will
jump into the fire to protect her dignity.

845
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:02,230
We'll perform Jauhar!
(Mass self-immolation).

846
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,650
But we will never let our Queen
set foot out of this fort.

847
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:12,660
How do I explain my grief to you all?

848
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:18,910
I shall go.

849
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,360
What are you saying, My Queen?

850
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,860
Even the Goddess had to descend
from her abode to slay the demons.

851
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:33,230
Who am I? A mere mortal.
I will only cross the threshold of Chittor.

852
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,980
And you forget, My Queen.

853
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:41,860
Rajput women are just as much
warriors as their men.

854
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:14,520
-My Lord!

855
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:18,860
I had told you!
I will bring Mewar down to its knees.

856
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:22,980
I can feel your pain.
That's why I play the flute.

857
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:24,900
Raag Yaman!
(Classical melody)

858
01:39:25,190 --> 01:39:28,320
Did it alleviate some of your sorrows?

859
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,940
It can't.

860
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:34,070
Your music once felt like sandalwood.

861
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:35,360
And now?

862
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,690
It stinks!

863
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:39,480
Stinks of treason.

864
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:43,360
You've lost your crown,
but not your pride.

865
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:47,960
Not until I have the enemy's head at my feet.

866
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:49,650
That's impossible!

867
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:56,610
Raghav Chetan's fury has turned
your stars unfavourable for you.

868
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:01,160
You will have to bow before the Sultan.

869
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,360
Play on!Yaman.

870
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,360
Greetings, My Queen.

871
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:31,150
This sword had sworn to protect Mewari pride.

872
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,770
But you've decided to go there.

873
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,400
You have embarrassed us.

874
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:38,230
Take this sword and behead me.

875
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:41,270
This is the only way to bring our King back.

876
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:46,650
Don't you trust
our ability to bring our King back?

877
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:48,190
I do!

878
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:52,860
But not every war is won with might.
This time we'll have to use a different strategy.

879
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:55,260
Our swords...
-Send a message to the Sultan.

880
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:57,690
I don't agree with your decision.

881
01:40:58,110 --> 01:41:00,320
As your brother...

882
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:05,570
This is not a request from a sister,
but an order of the Queen of Mewar!

883
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:15,270
For the sake of King of Mewar's safety,
Queen Padmavati has agreed to come here.

884
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:17,650
Congratulations Sultan!
Your wish has come true.

885
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:19,690
Keep reading...
-Yes.

886
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,070
But she has few conditions.

887
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:25,020
The Queen will bring
eight hundred maids along.

888
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:26,190
Agreed.

889
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:30,980
They will stay at the women's chamber,
where no men can go.

890
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:32,360
Agreed.

891
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:38,520
Upon her arrival, she will meet the King first.
And meet the Sultan only after the King is released.

892
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,520
Agreed.

893
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,270
And her last condition...

894
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,730
This is not possible, Sultan.

895
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:49,020
What does she want?

896
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:55,980
That palanquins won't leave Chittor until
Raghav Chetan's severed head is delivered to her.

897
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,900
Agreed!

898
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:03,270
This is unfair, Sultan.

899
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:06,360
Don't forget that Queen Padmavati
will soon be yours only because of me...

900
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:07,900
Agreed!

901
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,860
Greetings, My Queen.

902
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:22,860
What happened, Gora Singh?

903
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:25,020
Khiljis have sent a reply to your message.

904
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:28,400
Alauddin has accepted all your conditions.

905
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,560
And has also sent a gift for you.

906
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:43,170
Forgive me, My Queen.
We doubted your acumen.

907
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,320
You eliminated our enemy
sitting here in Chittor.

908
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,610
And now it's the Sultan's turn.

909
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,730
But it's an impossible task without your support.

910
01:42:54,110 --> 01:43:02,070
We swear on the Almighty.
Every Rajput sword will now obey your command.

911
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:06,360
Then take out the palanquins.
We will leave tomorrow.

912
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:07,820
As you say, My Queen.

913
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,980
I haven't seen the King's face in a long time.

914
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,860
My heart is aloof from the world!

915
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,400
My heart is aloof from the world!

916
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,620
Well said!

917
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,820
Ever since I'm consumed by love!

918
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:17,190
Well said! Very nice!

919
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:18,860
Now pay attention, Khusrau.

920
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,570
All my heart strings are tugged.

921
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:26,110
I've lost all slumber and peace.

922
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:30,480
My eyes are clouded with dreams!

923
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,940
Well said! Marvellous!

924
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:36,650
Did you notice?

925
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:41,740
Our most renowned poet,
Amir Khusrau praised my poetry.

926
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:44,520
But it seems Itaat Khan didn't quite like it.

927
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:48,610
Sultan, I don't understand such poetry.

928
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:51,150
Because you don't understand love!

929
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,470
You're not a poet, you're a coward!

930
01:44:57,570 --> 01:45:00,690
There's no reason to feel offended
by the Sultan's words.

931
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,650
That was no joke, it was an insult Ashfaq.
I cannot tolerate this anymore.

932
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:06,150
Now either the Sultan will live or me.

933
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:07,480
What do you want to say?

934
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:13,150
The court will celebrate tonight.
It's the right time to seize the throne!

935
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:51,470
My heart is soaring in the skies!

936
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:58,690
My heart is soaring in the skies!

937
01:46:02,190 --> 01:46:05,650
My beloved!

938
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:16,480
Ever since I'm consumed by love!

939
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:22,940
My heart is aloof from the world!

940
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:47,230
May Allah accept our prayers.
-Amen.

941
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,250
Physician!

942
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:51,570
How is the Sultan doing?

943
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,820
He is still unconscious.

944
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:54,940
Hmm...

945
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:59,520
The arrows were poisoned.
But by Allah's grace he's still breathing.

946
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:05,360
Prayer chants...

947
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,450
Uncle, I am here to inquire about your health.

948
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:43,320
You killed my Uncle for the throne.
And I killed you, Uncle!

949
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:46,900
Now Itaat Khan will be the new Sultan.

950
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:25,440
To become the Sultan,
you need strong ambition and a stronger will!

951
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,230
Praise be to Allah!

952
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,570
The Sultan is conscious again!

953
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:42,980
Praise be to Allah!

954
01:50:44,150 --> 01:50:46,230
Long live the Sultan!

955
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,730
Long live!

956
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:58,610
Greetings, My Queen.

957
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:00,360
The palanquins are ready to leave.

958
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:02,570
By tonight we must...
-Tomorrow morning.

959
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:07,690
We will reach when the
Khilji army is busy praying.

960
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:12,230
It will be easier to get to the King.

961
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:15,360
What are you doing, My Queen?

962
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,570
The map of Khilji's fort.

963
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,610
When Rajputs don the saffron colour,
they bathe their enemy in blood.

964
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:31,150
Sultan!

965
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:33,900
Congratulations!

966
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:36,110
You fool!
Mind the wounds.

967
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,020
There's good news!

968
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:40,980
The palanquins from Chittor
have reached our borders.

969
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:45,190
Queen Padmavati will reach
by tomorrow morning.

970
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,770
Glory be to God!

971
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,270
Glory be to God!

972
01:51:50,690 --> 01:51:54,070
She's arriving at a time when I am not
in a condition to welcome her personally.

973
01:51:54,150 --> 01:52:00,150
Don't worry Sultan. I will personally
escort her to you, with great fanfare!

974
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:05,570
I will welcome her in the Sultan's absence.
Not you!

975
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,840
If the Sultan wishes so.

976
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,520
Even I don't want any man
to go near Queen Padmavati.

977
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:12,230
Her decision is apt.

978
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:13,900
As you wish, Sire!

979
01:52:14,230 --> 01:52:18,940
The Empress of India will welcome
the Queen of Chittor.

980
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:20,940
Wonderful!

981
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:34,630
Islamic call to Prayer...

982
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:07,600
Inform the Queen of Chittor that Mehrunisa,
Empress of India, is here to welcome her.

983
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:23,680
You're truly a miracle of God!

984
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,640
Such beauty can even make
angels have a change of heart.

985
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,890
The Sultan is only human.

986
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:30,560
And a culprit too.

987
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:35,560
As per my conditions,
I will first meet the King.

988
01:53:35,930 --> 01:53:40,810
And until he is set free,
Gora and Sujaan Singh will be by my side.

989
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:43,350
Please come this way.

990
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:51,640
All maids, step out of the palanquins.

991
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:56,220
Malik...

992
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:57,430
Yes, Sire?

993
01:54:57,850 --> 01:55:01,310
Can you see any wound
other than my bleeding heart?

994
01:55:01,390 --> 01:55:02,390
No.

995
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:07,240
Remember, no guard should be around,
when the Queen arrives.

996
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:11,760
Be rest assured, Sire.
Your solitude will not be interrupted.

997
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:28,850
Islamic Prayer...

998
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:33,810
Greetings, Your Highness.

999
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:46,360
My King!

1000
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:53,720
Has Mewar bowed down to the enemy?

1001
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:56,090
No.

1002
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:58,350
Have you accepted the Sultan's conditions?

1003
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:00,510
No.

1004
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,350
Then why are you here?

1005
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:05,810
I am here to set you free.

1006
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,680
Mewar needs you.

1007
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:13,430
Empress, now that I have arrived.
Please release him.

1008
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:14,760
Most certainly.

1009
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:20,440
Hajuriya, please inform the Sultan
that I will bring the Queen to him shortly.

1010
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,810
Certainly.

1011
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:27,260
Now listen to me carefully.
We don't have much time.

1012
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,930
I will take you both to the secret tunnel.

1013
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:32,560
It will get you across our borders.

1014
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,680
Why are you helping us?

1015
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,560
I am doing this for myself.

1016
01:56:39,010 --> 01:56:41,890
I am saving my Sultan from
committing a heinous crime.

1017
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:54,060
-The prayers will soon be over.
We need to hurry!

1018
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:58,970
You need to leave before the guards are back.

1019
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,890
Wait, My Queen.

1020
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:03,720
I won't leave without meeting Alauddin.

1021
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,760
That could be dangerous for you.

1022
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:08,390
Your life could be in danger too.

1023
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:09,760
Allah is my protector.

1024
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:12,760
For God's sake you must forsake this thought.

1025
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:19,010
Empress Mehrunisa, I am a Rajput.
We never leave with our backs turned.

1026
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:57,720
Oh!

1027
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:03,510
King Ratan Singh!
How did you get to my court?

1028
01:58:03,590 --> 01:58:07,970
I had warned you.
You won't be able to stop the storm rising from Chittor.

1029
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:15,640
I am so unfortunate. Each time I dream of
meeting Queen Padmavati, you interrupt me.

1030
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:22,220
And you're so unfortunate that
I cannot show you my hospitality today.

1031
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:25,560
You were never worthy of being a host.

1032
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:28,560
Now you are not even worth
being my enemy.

1033
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,760
But you're still worthy, aren't you?

1034
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,930
Here...

1035
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:36,180
Today is your opportunity.
Pick up this sword and sever my head.

1036
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:41,900
Because if you leave me alive today,
you'll regret it forever.

1037
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,890
You're lucky your enemy is a Rajput.

1038
01:58:48,890 --> 01:58:51,760
We don't attack the wounded and helpless.

1039
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,760
You are so nice!
And so are your ethics!

1040
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:00,390
You should learn some ethics too Alauddin.

1041
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:02,640
They will make you into a human being.

1042
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:07,470
My dear, there are no rules in love and war.

1043
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:11,010
Without rules, your battle will be
remembered as a blemish in history.

1044
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:12,850
I will set that page in history on fire.

1045
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:17,810
History isn't just written on paper
which you can burn.

1046
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:24,060
The day you're able to lift that sword
we shall meet in the battlefield.

1047
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:35,260
I am leaving with my pride, my Queen,
from your fort and right in front of your eyes.

1048
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:39,760
These wounds will take time to heal.

1049
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:43,890
Until then my sword hangs over your head.

1050
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:55,850
Ulugh Khan!

1051
01:59:56,510 --> 01:59:59,310
Ulugh Khan!

1052
01:59:59,930 --> 02:00:03,970
The Sultan has issued orders.
Troops will be here any moment.

1053
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,810
Please leave immediately through the tunnel.

1054
02:00:10,930 --> 02:00:12,020
Gora Singh, let's go.

1055
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,470
You proceed, My Lord.

1056
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:16,390
I'll stop the enemy's army from following you.

1057
02:00:16,850 --> 02:00:17,930
We shall meet at Chittor.

1058
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:19,850
Hail Almighty!

1059
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:23,060
Hail Almighty!

1060
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:28,810
Dilawar!

1061
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:30,760
Dilawar!

1062
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:33,810
Dilawar! Seal the gates!

1063
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:35,290
What happened Commander?

1064
02:00:35,370 --> 02:00:37,850
We've been deceived.
The enemy is within the fort.

1065
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:40,760
Charge!

1066
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:02,560
Goodbye.

1067
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:15,890
Charge!

1068
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:26,590
War Cry!

1069
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:46,720
Bad news, Sultan.

1070
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:49,220
The Empress has foiled our plans.

1071
02:01:49,950 --> 02:01:52,470
Queen Padmavati and Ratan Singh
have escaped.

1072
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:58,220
Is love written in my destiny?

1073
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:06,680
Can you write it for me?

1074
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,510
No.

1075
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:58,310
The glorious warriors
who wielded their swords.

1076
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:04,810
The brave-hearts who fought valiantly.

1077
02:03:07,810 --> 02:03:16,720
We salute the fearless Gora and Badal...

1078
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:22,720
Who guarded the honour of Mewar.

1079
02:03:38,430 --> 02:03:39,640
Sultan.

1080
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:41,930
Now what should we call her?

1081
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:45,260
Empress or a traitor?

1082
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:13,060
My own people have deceived me.

1083
02:04:15,310 --> 02:04:18,010
Itaat's arrows have injured me all over.

1084
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:21,720
But your disloyalty broke my heart.

1085
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:27,930
I loved you immensely but you betrayed me.

1086
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:33,470
You took away my life's biggest dream.

1087
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:36,950
Now I shall take away your identity...

1088
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:41,930
...your imperial title,
the joy out of your life.

1089
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:50,390
Before I leave for Chittor,
my last wish for you.

1090
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:54,260
As I loved you immensely.

1091
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:59,760
May you stay happy, prosperous...

1092
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:02,220
...and blessed always.

1093
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:12,220
Malik!

1094
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,930
Yes, Sire.

1095
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:19,140
Before my rage buries her alive...

1096
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:22,720
...take her to the dungeons.

1097
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:24,890
As you say.

1098
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:29,470
Before I leave, I'll make a wish for you too.

1099
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:32,720
May all your dreams realise.

1100
02:05:34,810 --> 02:05:38,350
But your dream of getting Padmavati
shall never come true.

1101
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:11,850
-All hail Queen Padmavati!

1102
02:06:12,170 --> 02:06:15,390
All hail King Ratan Singh!

1103
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:33,140
-My Queen...

1104
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:36,930
The King and Queen Padmavati
have entered the fort.

1105
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:39,510
Everyone's making preparations
to welcome them.

1106
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:41,510
When everyone's busy welcoming them.

1107
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:43,220
Then what should I do?

1108
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:45,470
Welcome them.
What else?

1109
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:48,810
Queen Padmavati achieved
what she set out for.

1110
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:50,430
That is no ordinary feat.

1111
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:53,810
So I'd suggest that you come along
and welcome them too!

1112
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:56,010
You're not going anywhere, Kesar.

1113
02:06:57,510 --> 02:07:00,760
Go and get me a needle and thread.

1114
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:04,620
I will. But first I must touch
Queen Padmavati's feet.

1115
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:11,350
My Lord, we have all heard the legend of Savitri.

1116
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,510
Who fought the Lord of Death
and brought her husband back to life.

1117
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:20,850
Today I've started believing in that tale.

1118
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:36,220
All hail Queen Padmavati!

1119
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:37,810
Welcome back, My Queen!

1120
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:48,680
Today you must not cheer for us...

1121
02:07:49,150 --> 02:07:53,140
But those martyrs,
who laid down their lives for Mewar.

1122
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:57,850
Those who sacrificed their lives to save ours.

1123
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:00,970
As long as Chittor exists...

1124
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:03,930
...Gora and Badal's names will be remembered.

1125
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:08,140
All hail the late Commander, Gora Singh!

1126
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:11,970
All hail the brave Badal Singh!

1127
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:16,720
Congratulations, My Queen.

1128
02:08:17,390 --> 02:08:19,060
You brought our King back.

1129
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:23,060
You can look in the mirror again.

1130
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:26,700
Now everyone will worship
you like a Goddess...

1131
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:28,350
We couldn't save Badal!

1132
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:35,010
The Rajputs who lay down their lives
in the battlefield never die.

1133
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:37,010
They become immortal!

1134
02:08:37,810 --> 02:08:41,760
It was my son's duty to fight for Mewar.

1135
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:44,140
He attained martyrdom.

1136
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:49,220
Shedding tears for him...

1137
02:08:51,330 --> 02:08:54,260
I finally realised why Rajputs
are called brave-hearts...

1138
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:58,040
...because they have such brave mothers.

1139
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:04,350
This evening has come after a long time.

1140
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:08,900
You must look your best
when you meet the King.

1141
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:31,060
Khusrau, the river of love,
runs in strange directions.

1142
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:35,600
Whoever takes a plunge, drowns,
And those who drown, find a shore.

1143
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:36,890
Marvellous!

1144
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:41,180
You're fortunate that you can narrate your pain...

1145
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:44,510
...while I feel suffocated.

1146
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:48,510
I cannot bear this failure anymore.

1147
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:51,350
Sultan, what can I do to ease your pain?

1148
02:09:51,950 --> 02:09:54,720
As soon as we reach Chittor,
write a message.

1149
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:59,810
Maybe you can narrate
my emotions with your poetic touch.

1150
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:01,560
What do I write, Sultan?

1151
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:03,310
That...

1152
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:06,930
I will only wait for one more night.

1153
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:09,720
Fulfill the Sultan's wish, or else...

1154
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:12,340
...be ready to face his wrath.

1155
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:33,970
-There you are!

1156
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:38,640
What I feared has come true.
Alauddin has returned.

1157
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,600
This time with an even bigger army!

1158
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:53,680
You rubbed salt on his wounds.

1159
02:10:54,930 --> 02:10:56,470
This was bound to happen.

1160
02:12:30,510 --> 02:12:33,390
Be patient Sultan.
They will reply soon.

1161
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:36,640
Give the Rajputs some time to think.

1162
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,010
How much more time do they want?

1163
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:44,220
They'll have no option but to present
Queen Padmavati to you by tomorrow morning.

1164
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:50,720
I will wait from now on...

1165
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,140
Under the scorching heat?

1166
02:12:54,220 --> 02:12:59,010
I don't want to miss the moment when
the doors of the fort open and she comes out.

1167
02:12:59,090 --> 02:13:02,560
I want to be the first one to see her.

1168
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:24,850
Sanskrit Prayer chants...

1169
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:42,870
Hail the Goddess!

1170
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:00,180
What happened?

1171
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:03,850
My sword looks stunning in your hands.

1172
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:07,310
The sword is the most
precious jewel of warriors.

1173
02:14:10,090 --> 02:14:12,390
It's our pride.

1174
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:15,310
If it's our pride,
then why are your eyes moist?

1175
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:18,510
Do you fear that I might
not return from this war?

1176
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:21,760
Padmavati has never feared anything in her life.

1177
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,680
Can I ask you for something tonight?

1178
02:14:27,550 --> 02:14:31,470
There's nothing more you can ask for
except for my heart.

1179
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:32,890
I can.

1180
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:41,760
The right of Jauhar.

1181
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:48,710
I cannot even die without your permission.

1182
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:29,330
One heart.

1183
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:34,960
One life.

1184
02:15:36,130 --> 02:15:49,690
I shall sacrifice for you.

1185
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:56,980
There's me.

1186
02:15:57,230 --> 02:16:02,400
And my faith.

1187
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:14,270
I shall sacrifice for you.

1188
02:16:14,690 --> 02:16:20,400
One heart.

1189
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:10,730
Fire!

1190
02:18:45,630 --> 02:18:49,340
What is this?
I've never seen a weapon like this before!

1191
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:22,100
It's time for me to leave.

1192
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:26,190
Hmm.

1193
02:20:06,450 --> 02:20:09,230
It's the right time to move
our army forward, Sultan.

1194
02:20:09,310 --> 02:20:10,310
Not yet.

1195
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,810
The walls of the fort are crumbling.

1196
02:20:14,670 --> 02:20:20,980
Soon they will have no choice
but to face us in the battlefield.

1197
02:21:30,100 --> 02:21:34,600
My Lord, the army is waiting
for your orders to attack.

1198
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:36,060
No, Sujaan Singh.

1199
02:21:36,270 --> 02:21:37,600
I will go alone.

1200
02:21:38,230 --> 02:21:38,690
But My Lord...

1201
02:21:38,770 --> 02:21:42,310
This battle is between Alauddin and me.

1202
02:21:46,810 --> 02:21:50,020
Sire, why is he riding alone?

1203
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:52,310
To fight the Sultan, what else?

1204
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:53,690
Shall I go...?

1205
02:21:53,770 --> 02:21:54,730
No.

1206
02:21:55,810 --> 02:21:58,520
Only a diamond can cut diamond.

1207
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:17,230
In every age, a war for righteousness
is fought between good and evil.

1208
02:24:17,710 --> 02:24:20,270
Like the one between Lord Ram and Raavan,

1209
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:24,690
between the Pandavas and Kauravas
and now between the Rajputs and Khiljis.

1210
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,850
And each time, the good triumphs.

1211
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:35,060
Today, thousands of Rajputs have set out
to protect our dignity.

1212
02:24:35,810 --> 02:24:42,270
Chittor's walls have always shielded us.
But today our soldiers stand guard.

1213
02:24:46,580 --> 02:24:48,560
For us, they are no less than God.

1214
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:55,480
-When a Rajput fights for his motherland,
the echo of his sword resonates through the ages.

1215
02:24:57,520 --> 02:24:59,650
-Whenever darkness engulfs the earth,

1216
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:06,480
-Rajputs sacrifice their lives to spread light
and uphold truth and freedom.

1217
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:29,400
No, Malik Kafur.
This is against the rules of warfare.

1218
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:32,020
All is fair for the Sultan's victory.

1219
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:47,600
You could've at least fought
this battle with integrity.

1220
02:26:48,990 --> 02:26:51,270
There's only one rule in the battlefield...

1221
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:54,600
Victory!

1222
02:27:08,190 --> 02:27:09,560
Attack!

1223
02:27:12,350 --> 02:27:13,790
Charge!

1224
02:27:28,730 --> 02:27:34,940
-If our brave-hearts attain martyrdom today,
the enemy would still not be victorious.

1225
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:40,440
Chittor will witness another war,
one that is unseen and unheard of.

1226
02:27:40,650 --> 02:27:42,550
And that war will be fought by us women!

1227
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:49,520
Our enemies shall watch how we
turn our agony into victory.

1228
02:27:50,510 --> 02:27:56,310
It is time to reignite the holy fire that stood witness
to our oath, that only death will do us apart.

1229
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:04,020
We shall offer ourselves to the holy fire
and perform Jauhar!

1230
02:28:09,010 --> 02:28:13,940
Those who lust for our body,
would not even get their hands on our shadows!

1231
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:19,980
Our bodies will be reduced to ashes,
but our pride and honour will remain immortal.

1232
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:25,440
And that will be the biggest defeat
of Alauddin's life!

1233
02:28:26,690 --> 02:28:27,940
My Queen...

1234
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:30,310
Our King is no more!

1235
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:43,520
The time has come
to don the veil of fire.

1236
02:28:46,900 --> 02:28:49,060
Shut the gates of the fort.

1237
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:53,650
Shut the gates!

1238
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:15,150
Charge!

1239
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:46,690
Charge!

1240
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:11,110
Hail the Goddess!

1241
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:56,520
Queen Padmavati's Jauhar was
the biggest defeat of Alauddin's life.

1242
02:37:56,770 --> 02:37:59,060
And Chittor's greatest victory.

1243
02:37:59,950 --> 02:38:07,110
Centuries later, the tale of her
valour and sacrifice echoes in the heart of India.

1244
02:38:07,810 --> 02:38:14,690
To this day, she is worshipped as the Goddess Queen,
the destroyer of evil.
