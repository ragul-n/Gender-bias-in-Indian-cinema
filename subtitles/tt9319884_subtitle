1
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:26,641
'World famous Natasarvabhouma 
Mr. Nandamuri Tarakarama Rao..'

2
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:31,141
'..established a political party 
by name Telugu Desam..'

3
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:36,465
'..just in 9 months, like nobody has 
ever seen or heard of it,..'

4
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:39,870
'..on January 9th, 1983..'

5
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,654
'..he became the Chief Minister 
of Andhra Pradesh.'

6
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:47,452
'But in the next 
elections held in 1989..'

7
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:51,101
'..he lost for many unexpected reasons.'

8
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,239
'Because of that failure, 
his friends,..'

9
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,199
'..his family, his children, 
his party cadre..'

10
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,509
'..and all those who were near 
to him left him.'

11
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:07,307
'At that time a lady entered 
into his lonely life.'

12
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,238
'Her name was Lakshmi Parvathi.'

13
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,481
Who is it? 
- My name is Lakshmi Parvathi.

14
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,021
I spoke to Mr. Rama Rao on phone 
and took an appointment.

15
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:49,426
He is not feeling well. 
He is sleeping. It will take time.

16
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,899
That's fine. 
I will wait till he is awake.

17
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:54,399
Okay.

18
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:16,167
(Thunder crashing)

19
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,242
(Thunder crashing)

20
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,252
(Call bell rings)

21
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:25,540
(Anklets tinkling)

22
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:43,979
Swamy, I am Lakshmi Parvathi, 
who spoke to you on phone.

23
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:46,101
You gave me appointment.

24
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,776
Tell me, Lakshmi Parvathi.

25
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:53,115
Why did you want to meet me?

26
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:57,575
Swamy since I know,..

27
00:06:57,912 --> 00:07:01,548
..I have a lot of 
affection towards you,..

28
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:04,048
..your movies and your personality.

29
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:08,710
I never slept a day 
without thinking of you.

30
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:12,129
You influenced me so much.

31
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:16,170
I have seen many students,..

32
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,575
..who implemented what 
I told them about you..

33
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:21,062
..and have dreams of 
reaching great heights..

34
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:22,609
That's why..

35
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:29,616
..many things about 
your political career..

36
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,468
..to convey it to 
the future generations..

37
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:36,076
..it's my wish to write 
your life history as a book.

38
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:40,752
That's why I came here 
to seek your permission.

39
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:44,874
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi..

40
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:54,022
My life is as hills, abyss, ocean.

41
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:59,928
With the point of view 
that every human sees..

42
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,644
..its form changes.

43
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,794
Yours is a very early age.

44
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:09,050
To understand me..

45
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,348
..your experience is not enough.

46
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,563
My age might be smaller 
than yours, Swamy.

47
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:24,211
If you are a mountain, 
I am just a small stone.

48
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,126
But in my limits,..

49
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,331
..with all strength I have,..

50
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:32,860
..since my childhood..

51
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,622
..even I have been trying 
to swim against the stream.

52
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,092
What did you study?

53
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:45,520
MPhil, gold medalist 
in Telugu literature.

54
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,271
Oh.

55
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:51,293
From there, 
you have this deep awareness.

56
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:55,455
When I was making 
my mythical movies,..

57
00:08:56,893 --> 00:09:00,428
..I used to have wonderful 
discussions with scholars.

58
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:04,958
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi, 
please come inside.

59
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:07,617
The writer of your movie, 
Daana Veera Soora Karna,..

60
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:12,396
..Mr. Kondaveeti Venkatakavi, 
I have a lot of respect for him, Swamy.

61
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:14,829
Please come.

62
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,634
Forgive me. I made you wait outside.

63
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:42,135
Since I was feeling weak, 
I slept for a while.

64
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,827
Swamy, please don't say like that.

65
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:49,280
I can't hear the word, weak, from you.

66
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,901
NTR means power.

67
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,021
I always feel you as power of power.

68
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:01,259
I didn't wish for the power. 
People gave me.

69
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:06,113
I came to politics to serve them.

70
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,329
They trusted me and gave me power.

71
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,313
But, today, they didn't want me..

72
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:20,333
..and took back my power.

73
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:26,568
Now I don't have any desire on these..

74
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,964
..powers and seats, 
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi.

75
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:33,331
Swamy, there might be a 
number of reasons..

76
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:35,692
..for taking back what they gave you.

77
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:38,780
But what you gave them..

78
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,600
..can never be forgotten by them.

79
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:44,765
That might be, rice for two rupees,..

80
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,040
..or the construction houses for poor,..

81
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,756
..or the ban of alcohol..

82
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,255
..or can be some other thing.

83
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:56,191
Some, what you thought..

84
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:58,180
..what you implemented..

85
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:01,623
..might not have 
happened as they thought.

86
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,304
For that not happening like that..

87
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:07,971
..your subordinates not implementing 
properly might also be a reason.

88
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,323
Swamy..

89
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,800
..how many kings have lost in wars?

90
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:17,311
But with doubled courage, 
they tried again..

91
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,110
..and won in the war.

92
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:23,452
Victory and losing are just 
in our thoughts..

93
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:27,345
..and you know this very well.

94
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:31,869
"Victory or losing are just the 
thoughts that are in our mind."

95
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:37,343
"They both are just a part of life."

96
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:42,938
"The west sword stands against 
the Sun and defeats it."

97
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:48,093
"East comes and gives 
victory in the mornings."

98
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:53,818
"If eyes look forward, 
the victory will be yours."

99
00:11:53,898 --> 00:12:01,222
"Someone will come together and become 
light in darkness and umbrella in rain.."

100
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:06,627
"Someone will come in front."

101
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:10,996
"Someone will step forward."

102
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:22,533
"Even if fire rises, won't the 
summer tiredness go away?

103
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:27,550
"The rain drops fall slowly.."

104
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:33,422
"The clouds in the sky go 
away when air blows."

105
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,677
"Moonlight on the Earth 
makes everything sprout."

106
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:43,515
"At the time of the crops sprouting.."

107
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:48,557
"..won't the rain drops help it out?"

108
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:57,139
"The day when fought together, 
someone will come as a pair."

109
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:08,347
(Music)

110
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:15,344
"Sea will flow with new energy."

111
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:20,050
"When the full moon comes."

112
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:25,888
"When yagnam ends 
and the fire is warm,.."

113
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:31,052
"..it will fire again when the 
air becomes associate."

114
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,388
"When the cuckoo sings.."

115
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:41,672
"..will the autumn not be associate?"

116
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:49,797
"The day stay together, someone 
will come as your support."

117
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:56,773
So much of depth in meaning, 
awareness..

118
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,670
..in this age, how did you get it, 
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi?

119
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:01,690
By studying you, Swamy.

120
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,701
(Chuckles)

121
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,104
That means..

122
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,036
..is it that I couldn't 
understand myself?

123
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:10,938
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi..

124
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:15,859
I got full confidence..

125
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,920
..on your knowledge, 
on your personality,..

126
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,645
..on the way that you understood me.

127
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:24,940
You start writing the book.

128
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:28,314
I will give you the 
necessary information.

129
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:54,207
(Harmonium playing)

130
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:00,419
What is it, Lakshmi? 
Why are you so happy?

131
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:07,096
The dream that I have been dreaming of 
for so many years has come true today.

132
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:09,457
That's why I am very happy. 
- What dream, Lakshmi?

133
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,130
To meet Mr. Ramarao..

134
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:15,002
..and write a book about his life..

135
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:18,055
..my wish to convey his life 
to future generations..

136
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,888
..and dream has come true today.

137
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,795
Oh, did Mr. Ramarao agree for..

138
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,862
..writing his book? 
- Yes, dear.

139
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:27,102
What a great news, Lakshmi.

140
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,117
Such a great man's history..

141
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:31,902
..is being written by my wife. 
I am proud to say that.

142
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,947
I can imagine how you 
would be feeling about it.

143
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:37,049
You are feeling proud of it.

144
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,859
But I am going to 
feel as a responsibility.

145
00:15:40,454 --> 00:15:41,265
(Chuckles)

146
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:45,177
(Phone rings)

147
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,975
Hello. 
- Is it Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi?

148
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,601
The complete information that 
you need will be given by..

149
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,135
..my PA Mohan, and I told him.

150
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,833
He will call you.

151
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:02,673
Swamy, just now I was telling 
my husband about you.

152
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,629
He was overwhelmed when I told him 
that I am writing a book about you.

153
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:11,063
Swamy, please talk to him once.

154
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:17,048
Sir, greetings. 
- How are you?

155
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:18,501
We are very good, Sir.

156
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:23,353
Just now Lakshmi told me that you 
agreed to write a book on you.

157
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:25,048
Yes.

158
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:28,300
Not just on my life,..

159
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:31,128
..even on human's life..

160
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:35,280
..the deep awareness and thought 
that she has..

161
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,204
..I liked it so much.

162
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:40,254
That's why I agreed.

163
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:42,053
Very happy Sir.

164
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,546
'Not willing to kill..'

165
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,538
'I don't want victory 
and happiness of a king..'

166
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:58,046
'..and left down the bow and arrow.'

167
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:01,159
'Seeing Arjuna doing this, 
Lord Sri Krishna..'

168
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:11,538
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi..

169
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,670
..after you spoke to me the other day..

170
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:19,028
..my heart was at peace.

171
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:24,615
After so many years of 
struggle and tiredness..

172
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:29,691
..with a happiness that I got a 
person who understands my mind..

173
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,602
..after so many days..

174
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:33,306
..I got some heal to my heart.

175
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,894
Swamy, if you speak like this..

176
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,132
..I don't know why but my 
heart is sad, but never happy.

177
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,566
I am always your devotee.

178
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,683
You have to accept our service, but..

179
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,485
..never be disappointed alone.

180
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:04,735
Even now, your words,..

181
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:08,679
..are giving peace to my heart, 
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi.

182
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:13,281
I am giving you peace 
at this time means..

183
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:17,251
..I am happy from one side, 
but sad as well.

184
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:20,718
Swamy,..

185
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:23,045
..I have a request for you.

186
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,774
Tell me.

187
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,366
I want to see you in power again.

188
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:36,925
I already told you Mrs. 
Lakshmi Parvathi..

189
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:40,211
..that I don't have any..

190
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:44,000
..craze for power or seat.

191
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:51,747
Swamy, because of the 
inability of current government..

192
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,359
..people are suffering a lot.

193
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,181
I heard many saying that 
you are 1000 times..

194
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:00,361
..better than them.

195
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:04,745
It is your responsibility to save 
your people, Swamy.

196
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,796
You call for the cadets 
of different districts,..

197
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:12,045
..and party heads, speak to them..

198
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,614
..and listen to the situation 
in the State.

199
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:17,891
In this situation, for this state..

200
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,619
..your dream of eradicating poverty,..

201
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:23,825
..only you can do it.

202
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:27,431
Please ask everyone 
with a little patience..

203
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,732
..try to know everything 
and think about it.

204
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:33,338
On behalf of normal people like me..

205
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,897
..this is just my request.

206
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:56,931
Greetings, Babu Sir.

207
00:19:57,874 --> 00:20:00,036
What is it brother, how are you? 
- I am good.

208
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:04,490
Elder brother..

209
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,711
Greetings, elder brother.

210
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,144
What brother, how are you?

211
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:15,016
If we have your blessings, 
we will be great.

212
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,194
(Chuckles)

213
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:20,352
Her name is Lakshmi Parvathi. 
She is writing my biography.

214
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:22,566
You are doing a good work.

215
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:26,051
People need the history 
of elder brother.

216
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:29,709
Elder brother, you have to 
act in our next movie.

217
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:32,910
No, brother.

218
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:34,968
I am not interested.

219
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:38,566
Elder brother, please, listen to me once. 
- Hmm.

220
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:42,622
Swamy, you told this many times.

221
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:45,372
You are for the people..

222
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:49,048
..and your service is not 
just through politics..

223
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:52,127
..but has to be done through movies also. 
- Hats off.

224
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:56,045
You said it very well. Elder brother, 
don't say anything else.

225
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:59,418
You are doing this movie. I will go 
and make necessary arrangements.

226
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:01,548
Our movie will be a super hit, 
elder brother.

227
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:09,114
Srimannarayana.

228
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:11,872
Dear.

229
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,943
You don't know how pure he is at heart.

230
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:19,552
I wonder if such pure persons 
will be there in this world.

231
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,086
But, such person..

232
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,208
..was left by his own family.

233
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:28,572
I think, because of 
the defeat in elections..

234
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:32,541
..or because he was depressed, 
they might have parted a bit.

235
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:36,805
What is it, Lakshmi? 
It is in bad time that..

236
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,872
..his family should be with him.

237
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,078
Yes, but..

238
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:44,563
..why do we need his personal details?

239
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:49,337
At least speaking about 
the book I am writing,..

240
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:52,338
..he is coming out of it again.

241
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:56,421
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

242
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:59,084
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

243
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:01,557
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

244
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:59,632
How are you? 
- I am good.

245
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:16,916
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

246
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:22,765
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

247
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,385
Please pardon me, father-in-law.

248
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:43,906
I was late because of party work.

249
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,740
That's fine. How is party work going on?

250
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,101
They are going well. 
They are recovering now.

251
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,834
Her name is Lakshmi Parvathi.

252
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:02,250
She is writing my biography.

253
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:04,447
He is my younger son-in-law, Babu.

254
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:06,372
Greetings. 
- Greetings.

255
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:11,795
Babu, in the coming elections..

256
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,403
..we should take care that no mistakes 
happen from low level.

257
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:22,065
Sure. - I was discussing on it 
with them till now.

258
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:26,593
Explain Babu about 
all that we discussed.

259
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:33,266
One more thing. I am participating 
in movie shooting very soon.

260
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:09,178
She is cooking and other works 
at home, it seems.

261
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,087
Some of our people are saying..

262
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,059
..both are spending time at home itself, 
from morning to night.

263
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,968
They are discussing something always.

264
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:24,516
'Greetings everyone.'

265
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:27,354
'Sumalatha is the one reading news.'

266
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:29,567
'All India Radio, Hyderabad center.'

267
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:31,982
'Now the time is nine in the night.

268
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:35,783
Since there was continuous rain 
from evening in Hyderabad..

269
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:37,455
..some roads were broken.

270
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:39,870
So, some travels were objected. 
- (Thunder crashing)

271
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:41,509
People has to take necessary care..

272
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:43,637
It's raining heavily outside.

273
00:26:43,924 --> 00:26:46,019
They are saying that roads got blocked.

274
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:49,127
It's not safe for 
you to go at this time.

275
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:53,299
I will call to your home 
and inform your husband.

276
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,192
(Phone rings)

277
00:26:56,272 --> 00:26:57,597
(Thunder crashing)

278
00:26:57,677 --> 00:27:02,710
(Phone rings)

279
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:08,909
Hello. 
- Mr. Rao, this is Ramarao.

280
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:12,642
Sir, you called at this time?

281
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,091
Is Lakshmi fine, Sir?

282
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:18,317
I called you to inform the same.

283
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:21,071
It's raining heavily outside.

284
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,842
They are saying that 
the roads are blocked.

285
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,977
That's why I am arranging 
her stay here itself.

286
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:32,372
Okay, Sir. 
I can understand the situation.

287
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:33,959
Thanks, Sir.

288
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:37,782
(Call bell rings)

289
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,402
Mohan. 
- Sir.

290
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:47,423
Arrange a room for 
Lakshmi Parvathi downstairs.

291
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:50,092
Okay, Sir. Please come, madam.

292
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:01,037
It seems, she is with your 
father even in the nights.

293
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,308
Where did she come from and hung here?

294
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:10,599
She must be brought on road and peel her. 
- Who is that dare enough?

295
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:15,397
Who is her? We are many children 
and can't we do anything to her?

296
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,758
What can we do?

297
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,626
(Chuckles)

298
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:42,502
You said Kalakendram is ready. 
When is first kacheri?

299
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:44,746
I thought to discuss the same with you.

300
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,719
Everything is done. 
On the day of first show,..

301
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,881
..you have to see that Mr. Ramarao..

302
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:52,043
..will be there as chief guest.

303
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:53,557
I will ask him for sure.

304
00:28:53,637 --> 00:28:57,936
He also loves arts and artists.

305
00:28:58,107 --> 00:29:00,010
(Chuckles)

306
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,152
I will leave now, elder brother.

307
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:21,963
Swamy.

308
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:26,477
I don't know if this is right 
time to raise this request.

309
00:29:27,652 --> 00:29:30,287
I even don't know if 
I am eligible for it or not.

310
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:33,531
What are you talking about, 
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi?

311
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,274
You have the familiarity that 
you can ask for anything.

312
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:37,896
Ask it with courage.

313
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:41,288
Swamy..

314
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:43,870
..my husband has 
constructed a Kalakendram.

315
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:46,937
We wish that the inauguration 
should be done..

316
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:48,559
..on your hands.

317
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:52,639
What's in that?

318
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:56,180
I will happily come. 
You make arrangements.

319
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:07,017
Hail NTR.

320
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:13,301
Hail NTR.

321
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:28,287
Hail NTR.

322
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:33,193
Hail NTR.

323
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:42,584
(Applause) 
- Hail NTR.

324
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:51,189
Hail NTR.

325
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:57,946
Hail NTR.

326
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:07,999
(Applause) 
- Hail NTR.

327
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,116
I salute all those sisters,..

328
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:54,899
..and brothers of mine..

329
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,521
..who are here today.

330
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,985
Great salutes, salutes by an artist.

331
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:04,639
(Applause)

332
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:08,941
Today, I am here as an artist,..

333
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,955
..as a person who loves art.

334
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:20,563
Mr. Veeragandham Subbarao constructed 
this Kalakendram with an ambition.

335
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:26,206
With respect on his ambition, 
I came here.

336
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:33,006
(Applause)

337
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,968
Mainly..

338
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:38,293
..the respect and honour that I have..

339
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:43,780
..to Mr. Veeragandham Subbarao's wife,..

340
00:32:44,105 --> 00:32:46,402
..Lakshmi Parvathi, made me come here.

341
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:51,213
This couple has interest in arts..

342
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,774
..and the perseverance 
to do something to society.

343
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,897
Seeing this, I was very happy.

344
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:59,653
(Applause)

345
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:03,322
There is an artist in every human.

346
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:08,038
There is an artist in every one 
of you, who is here today.

347
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:14,133
I appreciate Veeragandham Subbarao..

348
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:19,349
..and Lakshmi Parvathi couple, 
who constructed this Kalakendram,..

349
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:21,816
..which enhances the 
talents of the artists.

350
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:23,038
(Applause)

351
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:32,241
Some after all person did some Kacheri..

352
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:34,363
..you went there that she invited you.

353
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,187
Without writing a name directly..

354
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:42,498
..some papers already started 
writing about them both.

355
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:45,376
Whispers started even in the party, Sir.

356
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:54,011
Just listen to the whispers. 
Don't react now.

357
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:56,308
Have some tea.

358
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:02,876
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi, 
why do you seem like this?

359
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:09,646
Swamy, was there any obscenity,..

360
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:11,984
..in our behaviour or in words?

361
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:15,673
Why are they writing about us in papers?

362
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:21,998
When we are sharing our 
thoughts with each other..

363
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,106
..with pure hearts with clean words 
and many spiritual things.

364
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,106
Why are they writing in 
newspapers like that..

365
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:34,146
..as if we did some wrong thing..

366
00:34:35,078 --> 00:34:37,619
..so baselessly? 
- Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi..

367
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:44,295
..every human who is getting 
good name, faces some issues..

368
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,241
..and this is also one.

369
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:48,984
How, if you feel sad 
for such small thing?

370
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:53,956
When we both know 
what it is for both of us..

371
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:57,037
..why should we consider about others?

372
00:34:57,117 --> 00:35:01,429
In Dana, Veera, Soora Karna, Mr. 
Kondaveeti Venkatakavi gave a dialogue.

373
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,591
Street dog..

374
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:07,861
..shouts with no knowledge 
of good and bad.

375
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,329
(Chuckles)

376
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:12,415
In my cine and political life..

377
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:14,227
..I have seen many things like this.

378
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:18,456
Not just newspapers and opposition..

379
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:20,929
..even my family members..

380
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,929
..and my dear ones as well..

381
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:29,591
..always tried to insult me 
and my personality.

382
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:32,699
What you have to understand is..

383
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:35,699
..we live for ourselves.

384
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:38,604
Not for others who don't understand.

385
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:45,617
Don't know, Swamy. The stableness that 
you are showing in this matter..

386
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:48,428
..I am unable to maintain it for myself.

387
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,334
It might be for the reason that 
I am facing it for the first time.

388
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:57,050
But this is not for me.

389
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:02,929
Who am I? But on you..

390
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:06,146
..with such blames on you, 
I am unable to bear it.

391
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:12,146
Lakshmi, the fame that I have will not 
become disgrace, because of you.

392
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:14,781
Don't care such thoughts.

393
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:19,497
These are very normal in politics. 
Unnecessarily..

394
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,875
..don't think much about 
it and spoil your heart.

395
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,875
If you feel sad, I can't see it.

396
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,781
But the people won't believe the news that 
comes in this newspaper. They know..

397
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:34,416
..what's truth and what's lie. 
Listen to me.

398
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,226
Stop feeling sad.

399
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:45,037
I can't see the tears in your eyes.

400
00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:52,078
Lakshmi, as he said, 
some say many things.

401
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,877
Don't consider anything.

402
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:59,565
When we know what we are, 
why care if others say other things?

403
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:18,605
"Your existence is the 
meaning of my life."

404
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:26,646
"Your entry is like a heaven to me."

405
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:36,200
"Your poems are like sandal smell 
of flowers."

406
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:39,510
"Your words.."

407
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:45,012
"..are like a book of friendship to me."

408
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:54,171
"This relationship is blooming 
and showering nectar."

409
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:59,779
"Only the lighting 'diya' is left, my 
dear friend, you are everything to me."

410
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:05,711
"This relationship is blooming 
and showering nectar."

411
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:11,604
"Only the lighting 'diya' is left, my 
dear friend, you are everything to me."

412
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:19,718
(Music)

413
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:40,536
"Like a morning for the rays,.."

414
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:46,198
"..you are like movement to my heart."

415
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:51,900
"Like a victory to movement, 
like an ending to a story.."

416
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:56,332
"..you are the same for the heart."

417
00:38:56,899 --> 00:39:02,575
"The life is blooming and 
the confluence is happy."

418
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:07,778
"It's a celebration with no ending."

419
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:19,932
"You are everything to me."

420
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:30,904
(Music)

421
00:39:54,937 --> 00:40:00,372
"Like the world to sky, 
like the wind to the world,.."

422
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:05,926
"I will always stay in you only."

423
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:11,940
"Like a sound in my heart, 
like a 'diya' in my heart temple.."

424
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,495
"..you are in my thoughts, you know?"

425
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:22,711
"Wow this moment is very beautiful."

426
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:27,237
"it's an unbeatable nectar."

427
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:39,240
(Music)

428
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:45,628
"This relationship is blooming 
and showering nectar."

429
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:52,237
"Only the lighting 'diya' is left, my 
dear friend, you are everything to me."

430
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:59,156
Lakshmi, for the many conflicts 
that I am facing..

431
00:40:59,913 --> 00:41:02,701
..I see you as a solution to those.

432
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:09,210
When and how will the life turn..

433
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,156
..is unknown to anyone.

434
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:17,561
But, some turns give meaning to life.

435
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,008
..and give memories, happiness 
and peace with only few.

436
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:27,373
That peace is felt by me, 
in every moment I talk to you..

437
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:32,914
..and every moment I 
see your smiling face.

438
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:39,130
Many times..

439
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:44,968
..I regret for entering politics.

440
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:48,522
My wife, Tarakam warned me.

441
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:52,630
Why do we need these politics?

442
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:55,873
Act as many days as you want..

443
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:59,454
..and stay at home happily after that.

444
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:03,467
Oh no. Don't say like that, Swamy.

445
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:08,048
Not to stay at home..

446
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,737
..your incarnation is to win this world.

447
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:22,088
He is getting closer to her, 
day by day and month by month.

448
00:42:22,305 --> 00:42:25,683
But what do they talk 
daily for hours together?

449
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,305
There will not be any words to speak 
when a male and female come together.

450
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:35,968
But, he, who has contacts with beautiful 
ladies, Sridevi, Jayasudha, Jayaprada..

451
00:42:36,197 --> 00:42:37,751
..what did he find in her?

452
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,805
We have to do something soon.

453
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:42,022
Correct time should come for anything.

454
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,481
Time will not come. We have to bring it.

455
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:50,062
If you say yes, 
I will go and talk to him.

456
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:18,589
I am not as great as to 
interfere in your personal matters..

457
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:22,048
..but it's a unavoidable situation.

458
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:26,886
I am here to speak to you on behalf 
of family members and party cadre.

459
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:30,333
You are a big star. 
But a bigger politician.

460
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,739
For great people like you, there's no 
chance to know what's happening behind.

461
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:40,875
Only small people like us will know it.

462
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,524
She is not a good lady, like you think.

463
00:43:47,821 --> 00:43:50,253
I came to know when enquired.

464
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,131
She has affairs with many, before.

465
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,320
Leave about her affairs.

466
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:04,023
Tell me about your affairs 
that you are doing..

467
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:08,415
..with my political enemies.

468
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,118
Remember one thing.

469
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,577
If you point one finger to others..

470
00:44:16,212 --> 00:44:18,612
..four fingers point you.

471
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:20,980
I don't need the report..

472
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:23,693
..that you or your spies..

473
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:25,898
..give me.

474
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:31,013
I am not a fool to not understand..

475
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,142
..a person's inner feelings.

476
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:40,202
He is blindly supporting her, means..

477
00:44:42,678 --> 00:44:44,754
..not just politically..

478
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:50,213
..but even personally means dead.

479
00:44:53,013 --> 00:44:54,256
Lakshmi.

480
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:57,521
I can't just ignore that 
everyone says anything.

481
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:03,716
Because of me, I don't want your name 
to be smashed by any idiots.

482
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:09,986
Lakshmi, I need to talk to you 
about an important matter.

483
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:18,572
(Song playing on radio)

484
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:21,210
(Thunder crashing)

485
00:45:27,284 --> 00:45:29,608
I need to talk to you 
about an important matter.

486
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:32,430
Why do you hesitate to tell me?

487
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:34,128
Tell me, Lakshmi.

488
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:37,663
Mr. Ramarao asked me to marry him.

489
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:46,701
What did you say, Lakshmi?

490
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,788
I said I will think about it.

491
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:52,702
What is there to think, Lakshmi?

492
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:54,702
Don't you know that you are married?

493
00:45:55,275 --> 00:45:56,810
Don't you know that you have a son?

494
00:45:58,691 --> 00:46:01,837
I don't know if it's right or wrong.

495
00:46:02,356 --> 00:46:03,783
Only thing I know..

496
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:07,750
..is that more than you, me or my son..

497
00:46:08,972 --> 00:46:10,572
..I care for his happiness only.

498
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:13,601
(Thunder crashing)

499
00:46:21,684 --> 00:46:24,311
The moment you told me about marriage..

500
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:28,517
..I got separated from my husband 
physically and mentally.

501
00:46:30,193 --> 00:46:34,106
Now, there's necessity to 
get separated lawfully.

502
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:12,216
I decided to marry Lakshmi.

503
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:26,508
Only after deciding that she is 
perfect for me, in all ways..

504
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:28,929
..I came to this decision.

505
00:47:29,102 --> 00:47:32,908
I expect you all to respect my decision.

506
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:35,352
Father. 
- Hmm.

507
00:47:37,178 --> 00:47:38,324
Look.

508
00:47:38,702 --> 00:47:41,081
She is not expecting anything from me..

509
00:47:42,064 --> 00:47:44,032
..other than my happiness.

510
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:47,783
From the day of your mother's death..

511
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:52,605
..don't you know the loneliness 
that I had experienced.

512
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:59,361
As a father, 
I did all responsibilities of mine.

513
00:48:00,518 --> 00:48:02,518
I am marrying her..

514
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:05,729
..only for myself.

515
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:07,469
Because of this..

516
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:10,929
..except getting support in this age..

517
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:14,994
..nobody will get any kind of loss.

518
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:18,854
Father, if you have desire for ladies, 
even at this age..

519
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,983
..we will get you a good lady.

520
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:23,484
But not like her.. 
- Shut up.

521
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:31,934
I am leaving you just with 
respect on your mother.

522
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:38,701
How dare you talk to me like that, 
about a lady I respect?

523
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:44,647
Get lost. Please go away.

524
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,145
Don't show me your faces again.

525
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:10,269
Lakshmi.

526
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:16,216
I told them, not for their permission.

527
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:21,577
Just because it's my responsibility to 
convey them the matter, as a father.

528
00:49:22,702 --> 00:49:27,869
They are not matured to understand 
the sacred relation between us.

529
00:49:28,864 --> 00:49:31,058
Why do you think of them?

530
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,593
I expect only one thing from you.

531
00:49:35,414 --> 00:49:39,057
Tomorrow if they come face to face 
and say something..

532
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:41,566
..do not feel bad for it.

533
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:48,019
Swamy, the love that you have on me..

534
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:49,857
..is great strength to me.

535
00:49:50,441 --> 00:49:52,051
But since I am an outsider..

536
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:56,387
..and your family is parting 
from you, because of me.

537
00:49:57,197 --> 00:49:58,602
Lakshmi.

538
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:02,354
I know who is mine 
and who is an outsider.

539
00:50:09,152 --> 00:50:12,644
She must have trained him 
on what to talk to us.

540
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:16,990
He took this decision, 
without even informing us. That means..

541
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,995
She trapped him by saying 
some magical words.

542
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:23,660
The question is..

543
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,822
..if she did it or he made her do it?

544
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:28,492
Whatever it is, 
we have to do her something.

545
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:34,287
If we want to do, 
we should not delay.

546
00:50:42,611 --> 00:50:45,638
Come, dear. Father is upstairs. 
I will call him right away.

547
00:50:45,718 --> 00:50:47,552
Stop your drama.

548
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:50,990
Don't try to cheat us, 
like you cheated our father.

549
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:53,443
What did I do? 
- Shut up.

550
00:50:53,523 --> 00:50:56,081
You did everything and 
asking what you did?

551
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:57,853
What an acting..

552
00:50:58,026 --> 00:51:00,697
You did black magic on our father 
and turned him to you.

553
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:03,454
I will kill you. Not like this..

554
00:51:03,534 --> 00:51:06,708
If you don't leave the house, 
you will die in our hands.

555
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:08,266
Did you understand?

556
00:51:08,616 --> 00:51:10,973
(Gasps)

557
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,568
Lakshmi, what happened?

558
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:28,071
Nothing. Some bad dream.

559
00:51:29,898 --> 00:51:31,055
What dream?

560
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:34,882
Some dream. I forgot.

561
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:38,298
Look into my eyes and tell me the truth.

562
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,200
Promise on me.

563
00:51:41,995 --> 00:51:45,876
In my dream, your family 
threatened to kill me.

564
00:51:46,308 --> 00:51:48,265
But this is just a dream.

565
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:49,794
(Chuckles)

566
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,492
What's surprising in this?

567
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:56,362
We should be surprised 
if they don't do it.

568
00:51:56,913 --> 00:52:00,816
I felt very ashamed listening 
to what they said about you.

569
00:52:01,453 --> 00:52:04,329
If they had still crossed their limits, 
I would have beat them.

570
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,037
But who are they to..

571
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:10,217
(Groans)

572
00:52:10,652 --> 00:52:12,587
Swamy, Swamy.

573
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,755
What happened, Swamy?

574
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:19,572
Swamy, what happened?

575
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,219
Swamy. Sister Kamala..

576
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:24,717
Swamy, Swamy.

577
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,279
Sir. 
- Swamy.

578
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:32,965
Sir. What happened? Please get up.

579
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:35,527
Please get up.

580
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:38,662
What happened Sir? Hold me, Sir.

581
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:42,348
What happened Sir? Sleep here, Sir.

582
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,759
Sir, what happened?

583
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:50,122
Sir. Okay, madam. 
- Call the doctor immediately.

584
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:32,207
What happened doctor?

585
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:36,012
Doctor.

586
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,482
Can you please stay 
outside for ten minutes?

587
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:59,901
(Crying)

588
00:54:03,818 --> 00:54:06,002
Doctor, what happened? 
- It's a mild stroke.

589
00:54:06,272 --> 00:54:09,440
Let's shift him to hospital immediately. 
I will go and make arrangements.

590
00:54:14,283 --> 00:54:16,056
Don't worry, Lakshmi.

591
00:54:16,499 --> 00:54:19,807
Crying is never a solution to a problem.

592
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:23,223
Sir, I need to make arrangements 
to admit you in hospital.

593
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:29,569
Mohan, this matter should not 
be leaked out at any cost.

594
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:30,758
Sure, Sir.

595
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:32,023
What is this?

596
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:36,455
Mohan, go out and close the door.

597
00:54:37,158 --> 00:54:38,164
Okay, Sir.

598
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:43,407
Lakshmi, my fear is..

599
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:48,780
..if they know that I am very sick..

600
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:52,391
..when I am in hospital..

601
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:55,613
..and in operation room..

602
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,537
..they might fulfill your dream.

603
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,947
I am unable to bear 
even the thought of it.

604
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:08,239
Lakshmi.

605
00:55:08,996 --> 00:55:11,631
Listen carefully to what I am saying.

606
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:14,564
Don't mistake the words I say,..

607
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:16,996
..or my love..

608
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:20,650
..or the meaning behind my words.

609
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:23,991
Please don't mistake me.

610
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,467
Lakshmi.

611
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:32,435
If I get a stroke again..

612
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:37,462
..there is a chance that I may die.

613
00:55:40,695 --> 00:55:41,960
Lakshmi.

614
00:55:42,311 --> 00:55:47,084
Listen to what I am saying and go back..

615
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:50,501
..to him and your son.

616
00:55:51,344 --> 00:55:53,117
If you stay with me..

617
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,420
..the day I can't protect you..

618
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:02,339
..they will surely kill you.

619
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:06,592
(Crying)

620
00:56:07,857 --> 00:56:12,804
Swamy, good or bad, 
there is a bond between us.

621
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,053
We reached here, 
crossing many obstacles.

622
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:21,766
You know that I didn't 
come into your life..

623
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:24,949
..seeing your glory.

624
00:56:25,738 --> 00:56:30,805
I don't care what everyone says.

625
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:36,308
For this life, life or death 
is only with you, Swamy.

626
00:56:37,757 --> 00:56:41,314
Leaving you alone is 
more than death for me.

627
00:56:42,351 --> 00:56:47,702
Please don't punish me like this, 
for the crime that I didn't commit.

628
00:56:49,313 --> 00:56:50,362
Lakshmi.

629
00:56:53,022 --> 00:56:55,800
I decided not to die.

630
00:56:58,147 --> 00:56:59,866
As long as you are alive..

631
00:57:01,725 --> 00:57:05,336
..I promise that I will be alive.

632
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:08,590
Till now..

633
00:57:09,487 --> 00:57:11,195
..we came together.

634
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:14,666
From now, we will fight together.

635
00:57:17,196 --> 00:57:19,315
Let's go to hospital.

636
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:25,163
Sir had a mild stroke.

637
00:57:25,336 --> 00:57:26,871
They are doing some tests.

638
00:57:27,228 --> 00:57:29,023
If needed, they will do a small surgery.

639
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:31,801
There is nothing to worry.

640
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,444
For now, he is fine. Let's see.

641
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,648
Many elders will come to see him.

642
00:58:42,113 --> 00:58:45,259
If they see you here, 
it will be a problem.

643
00:58:49,702 --> 00:58:51,875
What sin did we do? 
Why are you killing us like this?

644
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:53,670
Will you not leave unless you kill him?

645
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:56,113
She is not the type who listens 
to words, brother-in-law.

646
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:59,680
Hey, if you don't go away, 
I will hold your neck and push away.

647
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,929
If you beat or stab or kill me..

648
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:09,452
..I am here only to serve him.

649
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:15,560
Unless he says..

650
00:59:15,874 --> 00:59:17,376
..I will listen to anyone else.

651
00:59:17,456 --> 00:59:19,387
Hey. 
- Lakshmi.

652
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:32,900
What is it, Swamy?

653
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,084
This is my last warning to you all.

654
00:59:41,462 --> 00:59:46,002
There is no necessity for any of you 
to come here to see me.

655
00:59:49,182 --> 00:59:51,009
Go away from here.

656
01:00:10,008 --> 01:00:14,581
(Heart Monitor beeping)

657
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:31,236
Greetings, Sir.

658
01:00:53,713 --> 01:00:56,307
Greetings, elder brother. 
Greetings, dear.

659
01:00:56,772 --> 01:00:59,150
Is your health fine now? 
- It's better.

660
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:02,805
What is it, Babu? What's the matter?

661
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:05,259
By the blessings of Shirdi Sainath..

662
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:07,519
..everything is going fine, 
elder brother.

663
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:09,595
Our movie, Major Chandrakanth..

664
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,433
..is successful, and on this event..

665
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:14,265
..we have decided to do 
an event at Tirupathi.

666
01:01:14,556 --> 01:01:18,513
I came here to check for the date 
which is comfortable for you..

667
01:01:18,783 --> 01:01:20,491
..and arrange it accordingly.

668
01:01:21,988 --> 01:01:23,918
Do you think people will 
come for Tirupathi event?

669
01:01:26,544 --> 01:01:28,868
Since the movie is a great hit..

670
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,933
..even now, people has..

671
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,863
..craze on him.

672
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:40,360
Sir. Leave about the decrease in craze..

673
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:45,462
..our cadre is saying that 
the craze has increased.

674
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:49,311
As per Tirupathi guys, 
the estimate is that..

675
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:51,062
..people will be there in huge numbers.

676
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:54,359
Then, to our party, which lost..

677
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:58,424
..let's use that 
stage to get new energy.

678
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,835
Since he is not in a 
stage to listen to us..

679
01:02:07,342 --> 01:02:09,786
..let's ignore what happened..

680
01:02:10,543 --> 01:02:13,786
..stay close to him and respecting him.

681
01:02:14,478 --> 01:02:15,894
I feel that would be better.

682
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:18,921
We totally agree with what you say, 
brother-in-law.

683
01:02:25,202 --> 01:02:26,495
Give me that file.

684
01:02:30,618 --> 01:02:33,256
Elder brother, 
to sit on the stage tomorrow..

685
01:02:33,857 --> 01:02:35,732
..I thought of them as guests.

686
01:02:41,754 --> 01:02:43,397
Babu, give me a pen.

687
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:10,499
Why did you come here?

688
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:12,034
At first, on behalf of all of us..

689
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,715
..we came here to ask for excuse 
for whatever happened till now.

690
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:16,477
We couldn't understand then.

691
01:04:16,661 --> 01:04:18,683
But now we understood.

692
01:04:19,331 --> 01:04:22,531
But we doubt if the people 
will understand or not.

693
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:25,050
What does that mean? 
- That means..

694
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:28,013
..we saw the list who will 
be sitting on the stage.

695
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,067
Her name is also there in it.

696
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:35,472
Already there is news that you both 
have some relation, in newspapers..

697
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:39,234
..in party and in opposition, 
there are different news.

698
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:42,327
If they see her beside you now..

699
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:44,759
..those news will be proved as truth.

700
01:04:45,192 --> 01:04:47,552
After the defeat 
in previous elections..

701
01:04:47,632 --> 01:04:50,911
..we are gaining the status, 
and it'll be lost.

702
01:04:51,116 --> 01:04:54,554
With your image and age in your view, 
please think about it.

703
01:04:55,498 --> 01:04:59,195
Father, if you want, 
let her sit in the people below stage.

704
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:01,368
But not on to the stage.

705
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:05,854
If people see her on stage, we need 
not be surprised if they spit on us.

706
01:05:06,438 --> 01:05:10,308
They might even come 
on stage and might assault.

707
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:25,660
'My land is great and I salute it.'

708
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:31,833
'My land is worth and 
I always remember it.'

709
01:05:32,882 --> 01:05:37,012
'My land is great and I salute it.' 
- (Applause)

710
01:05:37,092 --> 01:05:41,044
'My land is worth and 
I always remember it.'

711
01:05:41,124 --> 01:05:45,087
'My country is my 
mother and I salute it.'

712
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:49,195
'My country is mother food and 
I always remember it.'

713
01:05:49,275 --> 01:05:53,314
'My country gave birth to 
a number of great people.'

714
01:05:53,394 --> 01:05:57,552
'My country has a great 
history, yes, my country.'

715
01:05:57,931 --> 01:06:01,493
Hail NTR.

716
01:06:01,573 --> 01:06:07,566
Hail NTR.

717
01:06:07,646 --> 01:06:12,171
Hail NTR.

718
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:15,190
Hail NTR.

719
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:20,931
(Applause)

720
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:32,347
(Applause)

721
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:42,010
I thank you all who 
upheld this movie like this.

722
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,372
I expected such a 
great hit of this movie..

723
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:56,079
..when elder brother 
agreed to do this movie.

724
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,219
Hail NTR.

725
01:06:58,299 --> 01:07:01,948
For giving me such a luck..

726
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:05,483
..I am thankful to elder brother.

727
01:07:07,782 --> 01:07:15,190
Hail NTR.

728
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,117
Now, elder brother 
will share his feelings.

729
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:21,320
Hail NTR.

730
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:42,282
Hail NTR.

731
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:44,866
All your hearts..

732
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:48,088
..are very happy and I know that.

733
01:07:49,201 --> 01:07:51,763
To say about Major Chandrakanth..

734
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:55,915
..regarding the plans 
for coming elections..

735
01:07:56,174 --> 01:07:59,266
..there is a necessity 
to speak about many matters.

736
01:07:59,698 --> 01:08:03,244
But, before everything else..

737
01:08:03,774 --> 01:08:05,979
..at this time of happiness..

738
01:08:06,152 --> 01:08:08,206
..in this sacred place of Tirupathi..

739
01:08:08,286 --> 01:08:10,963
..at the feet of that Edukondalu..

740
01:08:11,169 --> 01:08:14,034
..I need to share a very important 
matter with you all.

741
01:08:17,114 --> 01:08:20,574
I am going to invite 
a person on to the stage.

742
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,448
Lakshmi.

743
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:30,823
Who is Lakshmi? 
- Who is it?

744
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:00,507
Her name is Lakshmi Parvathi.

745
01:09:02,377 --> 01:09:04,626
I met her a few days back.

746
01:09:05,469 --> 01:09:07,955
We shared our hearts.

747
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:11,772
We decided to get married.

748
01:09:14,744 --> 01:09:16,485
We need your blessings.

749
01:09:16,565 --> 01:09:21,252
Hail NTR.

750
01:09:21,332 --> 01:09:25,966
Hail NTR.

751
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:30,680
Hail NTR.

752
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,890
Hail NTR.

753
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:39,263
Hail NTR.

754
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:06,861
Hail NTR.

755
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:13,158
Hail NTR.

756
01:10:13,238 --> 01:10:23,532
Hail NTR.

757
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:29,980
Hail NTR.

758
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:04,083
Lakshmi, go and get ready.

759
01:11:04,403 --> 01:11:06,850
I will tie you knot 
in front of everyone.

760
01:11:09,693 --> 01:11:12,039
"Righteously.."

761
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,759
"..financially.."

762
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,413
"..by desire.."

763
01:11:20,463 --> 01:11:24,073
"I will not walk away."

764
01:11:24,521 --> 01:11:32,002
(Music)

765
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:36,052
"Vasantha raag for winter.."

766
01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:40,658
"Cuckoo sing in winter night."

767
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:45,242
"The eclipse leaves the lonely heart."

768
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:50,237
"Getting married to lovable person."

769
01:11:50,317 --> 01:11:54,744
"This bond is of which birth"

770
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:59,047
"This is a sweet sandal."

771
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:03,231
"The destination shows the way.."

772
01:12:03,491 --> 01:12:07,848
"This marriage is conducted by heaven."

773
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:12,507
"This marriage is conducted by heaven."

774
01:12:13,072 --> 01:12:21,764
(Music)

775
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:31,048
"Like a God in silver curtain.."

776
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:35,535
"You are the shining star."

777
01:12:35,615 --> 01:12:39,621
"The only intention is 
to rule righteously."

778
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:44,496
"You are the walking 
Rama in this Kaliyug."

779
01:12:44,576 --> 01:12:49,015
"You are the star and you are Rama."

780
01:12:49,095 --> 01:12:53,383
"You are the Taraka Rama."

781
01:12:53,463 --> 01:12:59,188
Hail NTR.

782
01:13:07,871 --> 01:13:09,547
He did what he said.

783
01:13:10,756 --> 01:13:12,302
What do we do now?

784
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:15,124
In front of the craze 
that he has in people..

785
01:13:15,362 --> 01:13:19,329
..whatever we say or do, 
there is no use.

786
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:23,178
In the situation that we are in, 
except waiting for time..

787
01:13:23,535 --> 01:13:25,114
..there is nothing else to do.

788
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:28,033
I am frustrated to even 
imagine her beside him.

789
01:13:28,216 --> 01:13:30,800
From tomorrow, we have to 
see her in papers and TV.

790
01:13:31,179 --> 01:13:32,206
Disgusting.

791
01:13:36,974 --> 01:13:40,822
Elder brother, I take the responsibility 
of Rajamundry meeting.

792
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,444
But a small request.

793
01:13:42,941 --> 01:13:45,438
Please bring sister-in-law 
to this meeting.

794
01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:46,897
Why me?

795
01:13:47,243 --> 01:13:48,941
Why, madam. You have to come.

796
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,292
Lakshmi, you are my wife.

797
01:13:52,584 --> 01:13:54,951
Wherever I am, you should be there.

798
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:04,077
They are arranging a 
meeting in Rajamundry.

799
01:14:04,157 --> 01:14:05,882
She gave that idea, it seems.

800
01:14:05,962 --> 01:14:08,974
He is starting holding 
her saree in hand.

801
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:31,699
Hail NTR.

802
01:14:32,056 --> 01:14:38,856
Hail NTR.

803
01:14:39,202 --> 01:14:44,900
Hail NTR.

804
01:14:45,224 --> 01:14:49,970
Hail NTR. 
- Speak along with sister-in-law.

805
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:54,868
Speak along with sister-in-law.

806
01:14:55,095 --> 01:15:03,311
Speak along with sister-in-law.

807
01:15:10,189 --> 01:15:13,800
My husband, who is on stage, Mr. NTR..

808
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:16,909
(Applause)

809
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:21,868
..to the elders who came here, 
to those who arranged this meeting..

810
01:15:22,732 --> 01:15:26,691
..to the cadets of 'Mana Desam Party', 
to the leaders..

811
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:32,002
..I salute to the people who admire 
and respect Mr. Ramarao.

812
01:15:32,383 --> 01:15:36,344
Hail Mana Desam. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

813
01:15:36,424 --> 01:15:37,875
Hail Mana Desam. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

814
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:41,403
Hail Lakshmi Parvathi.

815
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:46,082
Seeing you all today, I remember..

816
01:15:46,437 --> 01:15:48,824
..a poem written by Mr. Jashua.

817
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:55,457
With what work he 
stepped into this world..

818
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:58,441
..he has to be asked immediately 
after he starts walking.

819
01:15:58,796 --> 01:16:01,771
With what work he 
stepped into this world..

820
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:05,222
..he taught everything 
even before asking.

821
01:16:24,301 --> 01:16:28,564
If her status in the party increases 
with same rate..

822
01:16:29,343 --> 01:16:32,966
..my political life will be submerged.

823
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:35,068
I don't care what you do.

824
01:16:35,266 --> 01:16:39,504
Number of news against 
her should come out.

825
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:45,360
For that, when I become 
the Chief Minister..

826
01:16:45,896 --> 01:16:47,704
..you will get what you have to get.

827
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:50,662
Okay.

828
01:16:53,033 --> 01:16:54,823
Leave it to me. I will take care of it.

829
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:07,650
Send information about 
Kurnool meeting to everyone..

830
01:17:08,299 --> 01:17:10,201
..even to party heads.

831
01:17:10,937 --> 01:17:14,777
We've to start victory from this meeting. 
- Swamy.

832
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:21,660
Now you can leave. 
- Okay Sir.

833
01:17:26,045 --> 01:17:27,420
What is this Swamy?

834
01:17:28,259 --> 01:17:30,430
I am running domination in the party..

835
01:17:31,027 --> 01:17:35,447
..and they wrote that Rajamundry meeting 
is Lakshmi Parvathi's entry to politics.

836
01:17:35,802 --> 01:17:39,235
I have been thinking of asking you 
about this since many days.

837
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,703
But now, since it is time, 
I am asking you.

838
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:45,497
What is the reason behind the gap..

839
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,841
..between you and 
the owner of this paper?

840
01:17:51,136 --> 01:17:52,891
When I became the Chief Minister..

841
01:17:53,713 --> 01:17:56,793
..he tried to do authority on me.

842
01:17:57,225 --> 01:17:59,430
But I didn't agree for that. So..

843
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:02,501
..now, he is doing wrong campaign on me.

844
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,866
Enmity with media is not good for..

845
01:18:06,567 --> 01:18:08,503
..you and the party, Swamy.

846
01:18:08,762 --> 01:18:11,184
If you meet and speak, 
that would be better.

847
01:18:11,703 --> 01:18:12,698
Lakshmi.

848
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:16,815
I have seen many jackals like him.

849
01:18:18,579 --> 01:18:20,879
If they growl..

850
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:24,252
..there will be no loss 
for me and my party.

851
01:18:25,152 --> 01:18:27,245
For me, people are important.

852
01:18:28,067 --> 01:18:29,961
Thinking that some people are able..

853
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:32,953
..I left some decisions to them.

854
01:18:33,393 --> 01:18:36,403
But, that ability went wrong way..

855
01:18:37,233 --> 01:18:39,681
..and the corrupt politics 
that they played..

856
01:18:40,408 --> 01:18:42,354
..gave a great loss to the party.

857
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:44,801
I ignored whatever they did..

858
01:18:44,881 --> 01:18:46,704
..all these days.

859
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:49,265
But by the next elections time..

860
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:53,078
..the corruption and 
the bribery in the party..

861
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:55,430
..has to be removed completely.

862
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:58,509
I will concentrate myself on it.

863
01:18:58,734 --> 01:18:59,737
That's it.

864
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:02,548
Not on the people 
who publish wrong news.

865
01:19:09,476 --> 01:19:11,940
He doesn't take bribes.

866
01:19:12,555 --> 01:19:14,310
So if he doesn't allow others to take..

867
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:16,516
..then how will we lead our lives?

868
01:19:17,346 --> 01:19:19,456
He kept the complete 
power in his hands..

869
01:19:19,663 --> 01:19:23,322
..and leaving us with such popularity, 
he is trusting those who are not known.

870
01:19:24,403 --> 01:19:25,865
Some Atchaiah Chowdary it seems.

871
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:30,129
Under his leadership, some meeting 
is being conducted at Khairatabad.

872
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,524
Devi, go there tomorrow..

873
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,010
..create pandemonium 
and enrage his razzle.

874
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:43,458
What if I enrage?

875
01:19:43,538 --> 01:19:47,704
In the rage of anger, 
he will take some decision.

876
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:49,425
What kind of decision?

877
01:19:49,807 --> 01:19:52,842
Devi, listen to me carefully.

878
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,586
Elder brother said that he will take 
care to resolve many pending plans.

879
01:20:14,924 --> 01:20:20,079
Even we go in his way and.. 
- Who gave permission for this meeting?

880
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:23,010
Go away. 
- What is this? Are you threatening us?

881
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,631
Who asked you to conduct this meeting? 
- What is this?

882
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:29,401
Mr. NTR. 
- This is my office, my area.

883
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:31,693
The authority of this 
complete area is mine.

884
01:20:31,773 --> 01:20:36,354
Without my permission, who are you 
and that NTR to conduct this meeting?

885
01:20:36,434 --> 01:20:38,576
Talk properly.

886
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:42,935
Don't you have respect for him? 
- Why should I respect you and him?

887
01:20:43,091 --> 01:20:46,084
You conduct meeting at my 
office, without my permission?

888
01:20:46,164 --> 01:20:48,376
Go away? What is it, man? 
- Leave me.

889
01:20:50,347 --> 01:20:51,627
Leave my shirt first.

890
01:20:53,435 --> 01:20:55,052
Hey, I will break you.

891
01:20:55,753 --> 01:20:57,275
I am telling you.

892
01:21:14,675 --> 01:21:15,791
What happened brother?

893
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:32,699
I will suspend from 
the party immediately.

894
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:36,029
Mohan. 
- Swamy, please don't be emotional.

895
01:21:36,228 --> 01:21:37,914
Take decision peacefully.

896
01:21:38,286 --> 01:21:40,560
Such a big punishment 
to suspend from party?

897
01:21:40,846 --> 01:21:42,195
You don't know Lakshmi.

898
01:21:42,506 --> 01:21:43,535
You don't interfere into this.

899
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:45,230
Suspension has to be done.

900
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:48,612
Just because Lakshmi Parvathi said..

901
01:21:48,854 --> 01:21:51,077
..NTR suspended me from the party.

902
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:53,620
NTR is not in that party. 
- (Camera clicks)

903
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,168
Only she is there.

904
01:21:55,643 --> 01:21:58,420
She is making NTR play like a doll.

905
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,421
That's it. Party will get destroyed. 
Go away. - (Camera clicks)

906
01:22:09,478 --> 01:22:10,743
(Camera clicks)

907
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:13,504
For physical relation..

908
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:17,578
..or for some personal perpetration..

909
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:20,078
..I didn't marry her.

910
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:24,783
I married her for my mental peace.

911
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:29,376
For that, so many accusations on us?

912
01:22:30,275 --> 01:22:34,349
Devi insulted me and my party.

913
01:22:35,214 --> 01:22:38,060
That's why I suspended 
her from the party.

914
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,910
Is it wrong?

915
01:22:40,128 --> 01:22:42,964
It's very wrong to point Lakshmi..

916
01:22:43,189 --> 01:22:45,247
..and talk for this.

917
01:22:46,225 --> 01:22:50,039
She says and you believe 
it and write in paper.

918
01:22:50,463 --> 01:22:52,227
At least from now..

919
01:22:52,391 --> 01:22:54,501
..in any matter..

920
01:22:54,934 --> 01:22:57,762
..don't publish anything 
without knowing the truth.

921
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:01,602
Her suspension should 
be a lesson to all of you.

922
01:23:02,147 --> 01:23:05,355
I should never hear about 
group politics in the party.

923
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,745
That's why I am cancelling 
the State committees.

924
01:23:09,334 --> 01:23:11,401
From now any decision in the party..

925
01:23:11,481 --> 01:23:14,289
..will not take place 
without my knowledge.

926
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:16,572
That's why I am establishing 
the Adhoc committee.

927
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:19,003
This time, even in the 
case of seats as well..

928
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:21,546
..I will give the decision by myself.

929
01:23:22,091 --> 01:23:24,140
My decisions will be 
declared to you very soon.

930
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:28,897
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

931
01:23:29,165 --> 01:23:35,980
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

932
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,159
Hail NTR. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

933
01:23:47,015 --> 01:23:49,471
All the decisions that she 
tells him in the bedroom..

934
01:23:49,869 --> 01:23:51,711
..are being declared in the hall by him.

935
01:23:53,596 --> 01:23:58,067
But still, what experience does 
she have to take such decisions?

936
01:23:58,147 --> 01:24:01,207
Is experience required to say rubbish?

937
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:03,144
Are we part of the party?

938
01:24:03,412 --> 01:24:04,701
If all decisions are taken by..

939
01:24:05,271 --> 01:24:07,018
..her in the kitchen, then why us?

940
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,354
(Phone rings)

941
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,554
(Phone rings)

942
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,919
I am announcing the candidates list.

943
01:24:19,464 --> 01:24:21,064
You all come home.

944
01:24:21,661 --> 01:24:22,708
Okay, sir.

945
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:26,297
With respect on me and my party..

946
01:24:26,548 --> 01:24:28,494
..those who worked with commitment..

947
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,071

Bobbili - Ramappa Naidu.

959
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:12,893
After so many years, 
we are left with mud.

960
01:25:13,845 --> 01:25:16,820
There is not even one 
more than 10-15 persons..

961
01:25:17,019 --> 01:25:18,645
..from the list.

962
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:23,219
That means, does he feel 
that we are useless?

963
01:25:23,928 --> 01:25:25,130
Not, that means.

964
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:27,681
It is.

965
01:25:37,636 --> 01:25:39,703
Publicise the news that..

966
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,365
..she gave all the names..

967
01:25:41,555 --> 01:25:43,466
..and publish it in your paper.

968
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:44,781
Okay.

969
01:25:54,422 --> 01:25:59,957
(Crying)

970
01:26:02,769 --> 01:26:04,628
I already told you, right?

971
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,367
Whatever anyone says..

972
01:26:06,952 --> 01:26:08,365
..whatever anyone writes..

973
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,294
..people are on our side.

974
01:26:11,972 --> 01:26:14,411
Let's concentrate on elections.

975
01:26:18,147 --> 01:26:23,086
NTR. 
- NTR.

976
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:29,711
NTR. 
- NTR.

977
01:26:29,791 --> 01:26:34,719
NTR.

01:26:55,803 --> 01:26:57,039
"Roar."

981
01:26:57,494 --> 01:26:59,003
"It's the roar of a lion."

982

"Let's beat corruption very hard, 
with our right to say no."

983
01:27:04,747 --> 01:27:09,138

groups of Mushkara and Taskara."

984

red eyes, who disturb us."

985
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:17,890

who sat in the seats."

986

let's make them fall hard."

and beat our target hard."

"The blood in hands boil like fire.."

995
01:27:54,093 --> 01:27:57,977
"The nerves get twisted with 
ego and be angry."

996
01:27:58,591 --> 01:28:02,448
"It becomes a big war of words 
and the world shakes."

"The ruthless persons, who beat 
their laps should be finished."

998
01:28:07,586 --> 01:28:11,979
"The idiots necks should be bent 
and regain the lost glory."

999
01:28:12,059 --> 01:28:16,477

with our right to say no."

the enemy will shake with fear."

"This is the truth that is 
held on the Earth."

1004
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:56,590
"The war of standing in history and 
supporting has begun now."

1005
01:28:56,910 --> 01:29:00,188
"Like a roar to become a 
group and get stronger."

1006
01:29:01,113 --> 01:29:05,722
"Let's go against the reckless demon 
wings and crush it down."

1007
01:29:05,895 --> 01:29:10,297
"Let's throw it in different directions 
by becoming the thunder."

1008
01:29:10,377 --> 01:29:11,499
"Roar."

Hello.

Is it? Okay.

victory, it's a great victory."

1043
01:31:45,261 --> 01:31:49,136
"Victory, victory, it's a good time."

1044
01:32:09,676 --> 01:32:12,729
"Celebration kisses the sky."

1045
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:17,823
"The heart turned out to be a garden."

1046
01:32:17,987 --> 01:32:21,663
"The flag flying like a king.."

1047
01:32:22,053 --> 01:32:25,867
"Like a signature of the Lord."

1048
01:32:26,075 --> 01:32:30,122
"The kingdom called us 
and made you stand like a king."

1049
01:32:30,202 --> 01:32:32,639
"Good song bloomed out.." 
- Lakshmi.

1050
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,446
What are you writing?

1051
01:32:36,617 --> 01:32:39,194
I am writing about the victory 
you achieved, Swamy.

1052
01:32:39,549 --> 01:32:43,527
How many accusations 
did they do about you?

1053
01:32:43,888 --> 01:32:46,554
This great victory is like a 
slap on all their faces.

1054
01:32:47,539 --> 01:32:49,736
Lakshmi, you are my Goddess.

1055
01:32:49,926 --> 01:32:54,216
You brought back my happiness, 
my health and my authority.

1056
01:32:54,657 --> 01:32:56,767
Truly, you came into my life..

1057
01:32:56,932 --> 01:32:58,402
..like goddess Lakshmi.

1058
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:09,196
"Happiness rouse in the hearts today."

1059
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:17,347
(Music)

1060
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:26,491
Me..

1061
01:33:26,571 --> 01:33:29,172
I, Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao,..

1062
01:33:29,414 --> 01:33:31,377
..do swear in the name of 
God/solemnly affirm that..

1063
01:33:31,457 --> 01:33:33,393
..do swear in the name of 
God/solemnly affirm that..

1064
01:33:33,473 --> 01:33:36,662
..as per the Constitution of India.. 
- ..as per the Constitution of India..

1065
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:40,052
..that I will bear true faith 
and allegiance..

1066
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:43,953
..that I will uphold the sovereignty..

1067
01:33:44,255 --> 01:33:46,737
..and integrity of India,..

1068
01:33:47,896 --> 01:33:50,663
..conscientiously discharge my duties..

1069
01:33:51,528 --> 01:33:54,797
..as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh..

1070
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,816
..without fear or favour,..

1071
01:33:58,578 --> 01:34:00,515
..affection..

1072
01:34:01,138 --> 01:34:03,490
..or ill-will..

1073
01:34:03,767 --> 01:34:06,976
..in accordance with the 
Constitution and the law..

1074
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:10,704
..that I will do right to 
all manner of people..

1075
01:34:11,353 --> 01:34:13,896
..I swear this with my pure heart.

1076
01:34:13,976 --> 01:34:21,281
Hail NTR. 
- (Applause)

1077
01:34:27,925 --> 01:34:29,170
I will take care of it.

1078
01:34:31,928 --> 01:34:34,065
What is he thinking..

1079
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:36,556
..what decision is he taking..

1080
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,104
..I am unable to understand it.

1081
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:41,381
There is no use even after winning.

1082
01:34:43,388 --> 01:34:45,126
The main matter more 
important of these..

1083
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:47,626
..is, for every meeting..

1084
01:34:47,842 --> 01:34:50,351
..he is taking her with him. So..

1085
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,677
..these foolish people are..

1086
01:34:53,222 --> 01:34:56,249
..thinking that she is the 
political heir of him.

1087
01:34:56,979 --> 01:34:58,775
After his death..

1088
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:01,196
..she might become the leader.

1089
01:35:01,456 --> 01:35:04,388
Then, how to separate her?

1090
01:35:07,511 --> 01:35:09,206
Even I don't understand the same.

1091
01:35:12,855 --> 01:35:16,885
These days he is not even 
allowing me near him.

1092
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:44,128
Greetings, Sir. That's fine. 
- Sorry Babu, I got late in the court.

1093
01:35:44,967 --> 01:35:46,913
What is it, 
Babu, you came here suddenly?

1094
01:35:50,727 --> 01:35:53,650
What is it? 
You seem like you are tensed.

1095
01:35:56,176 --> 01:35:58,874
Sir. For the mistakes I did..

1096
01:35:59,143 --> 01:36:01,383
..Mr. Ramarao is not talking to me.

1097
01:36:02,032 --> 01:36:04,687
May be for what I said long 
back about Lakshmi Parvathi.

1098
01:36:05,742 --> 01:36:07,316
What is there that you don't know.

1099
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,974
I need your help at this time.

1100
01:36:11,796 --> 01:36:14,166
You are very close to 
Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi, right?

1101
01:36:15,929 --> 01:36:17,382
You just speak to her once.

1102
01:36:28,162 --> 01:36:31,066
(Phone rings)

1103
01:36:35,985 --> 01:36:38,882
Hello. 
- Hello, sister, how are you?

1104
01:36:39,946 --> 01:36:42,152
I am good, brother. How are you?

1105
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:44,703
I am first class. We are all good.

1106
01:36:45,257 --> 01:36:47,955
Tell me, brother. You called 
me after so many days.

1107
01:36:48,481 --> 01:36:51,744
I will ask you something. 
Can you do me that favour?

1108
01:36:52,859 --> 01:36:54,252
Why do you say like that, brother?

1109
01:36:54,537 --> 01:36:57,331
If I can do it, 
I will surely do it. Tell me.

1110
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:00,626
His father-in-law 
is not talking to Babu..

1111
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:04,431
..so to explain few things, 
he want to talk to you, sister.

1112
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:09,759
Just for my sake, 
talk to him about everything..

1113
01:37:10,243 --> 01:37:12,379
..and I request to clear all 
the misunderstandings.

1114
01:37:13,522 --> 01:37:15,623
I am handing him the phone. 
Please talk to him.

1115
01:37:26,157 --> 01:37:26,858
Hello.

1116
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,207
Tell me, Babu.

1117
01:37:32,522 --> 01:37:36,371
Madam, for what I said to 
him long back against you..

1118
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:39,771
..he is very angry with me.

1119
01:37:41,475 --> 01:37:43,031
I mistook and..

1120
01:37:43,455 --> 01:37:45,695
..I spoke on behalf of everyone.

1121
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,152
But I didn't do it intentionally.

1122
01:37:50,893 --> 01:37:53,946
If I am kept away from 
party works at this time..

1123
01:37:54,465 --> 01:37:57,319
..I don't find another way 
other than going back..

1124
01:37:57,855 --> 01:37:59,291
..to Chittoor and do some business.

1125
01:38:02,248 --> 01:38:05,007
He should forget all that 
I said to him listening..

1126
01:38:05,587 --> 01:38:06,582
..to some bad people.

1127
01:38:07,308 --> 01:38:09,038
Please.

1128
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:11,598
No, Babu.

1129
01:38:13,259 --> 01:38:15,205
Some day you will know the truth..

1130
01:38:15,568 --> 01:38:16,900
..and he is eagerly waiting for it.

1131
01:38:17,739 --> 01:38:19,053
I didn't do anything wrong.

1132
01:38:19,537 --> 01:38:20,748
I stepped into your..

1133
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,628
..father-in-law's life very sacredly.

1134
01:38:24,337 --> 01:38:27,702
For what I said against you, 
please excuse me.

1135
01:38:29,008 --> 01:38:30,884
Very happy, Babu.

1136
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:34,388
My quest is that he should get 
close to his family members.

1137
01:38:35,553 --> 01:38:39,188
If we all get together, 
he will be at peace.

1138
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:42,890
His health will recover even speeder.

1139
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:47,950
Babu, I don't know about 
these political issues.

1140
01:38:49,031 --> 01:38:51,755
I am just his associate.

1141
01:38:53,381 --> 01:38:55,015
Tell me what should I do.

1142
01:38:56,045 --> 01:38:57,905
You have to speak to him somehow.

1143
01:38:59,366 --> 01:39:01,580
Please. 
- I understood.

1144
01:39:02,618 --> 01:39:05,628
But he has many distrusts on you.

1145
01:39:06,588 --> 01:39:09,373
There is a necessity to 
prove your commitment.

1146
01:39:10,817 --> 01:39:12,624
Please promise me first..

1147
01:39:12,901 --> 01:39:15,920
..that you will not harm 
as long as he is alive.

1148
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,376
If he is not there, 
I don't exist, madam.

1149
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:22,078
I promise on my son, Lokesh, 
that I will never do..

1150
01:39:22,969 --> 01:39:25,468
..anything that hurts him.

1151
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:39,558
Your son-in-law spoke to me.

1152
01:39:40,612 --> 01:39:42,136
(Coughs)

1153
01:39:48,674 --> 01:39:49,634
Who?

1154
01:39:50,231 --> 01:39:50,931
Babu?

1155
01:39:51,554 --> 01:39:53,777
Yes. He asked me to pardon him.

1156
01:39:54,079 --> 01:39:54,936
Why is that?

1157
01:39:55,558 --> 01:39:58,049
Did you become good, all of a sudden?

1158
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:01,301
For everyone's good, 
we have to adjust ourselves.

1159
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:07,226
Did you forget, what he did and 
what he said about us?

1160
01:40:07,598 --> 01:40:09,034
Poor lady.

1161
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:11,792
What do you know about these politics?

1162
01:40:12,545 --> 01:40:15,494
Your character is like who imagine 
that all that is white is milk.

1163
01:40:17,414 --> 01:40:19,083
He is an expert in this.

1164
01:40:19,163 --> 01:40:22,473
He is of the type who catches hair, 
when he reaches or feet when he can't.

1165
01:40:24,013 --> 01:40:25,941
He used to say very 
bad things about you.

1166
01:40:26,538 --> 01:40:29,358
Instead of feeling 
ashamed to come near you..

1167
01:40:30,223 --> 01:40:32,004
..that is his politics.

1168
01:40:33,318 --> 01:40:36,354
He prays to the feet and pulls the legs.

1169
01:40:37,668 --> 01:40:40,159
Instead of thinking about yourself..

1170
01:40:40,341 --> 01:40:41,993
..why do you bother about someone else?

1171
01:40:43,343 --> 01:40:44,233
Poor lady.

1172
01:40:45,021 --> 01:40:48,809
What happens if you rear a snake, 
pouring milk? It will bite you back.

1173
01:40:48,889 --> 01:40:50,176
That is his nature.

1174
01:40:50,712 --> 01:40:53,799
Look. Now the party is in authority.

1175
01:40:54,309 --> 01:40:56,350
The papers are publishing 
whatever they want about our family..

1176
01:40:56,581 --> 01:40:58,011
..in papers every day.

1177
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:03,330
In this situation, we have to adjust 
little for the good of everyone.

1178
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:06,401
My good got mixed with your good.

1179
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:10,181
After our marriage, 
if there is any loss for you..

1180
01:41:10,466 --> 01:41:12,161
..I will be the one who will be sad.

1181
01:41:12,957 --> 01:41:14,851
He promised on his son.

1182
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:17,108
He will be trusted associate of yours.

1183
01:41:17,843 --> 01:41:20,749
Please pardon him for this time.

1184
01:41:22,616 --> 01:41:23,498
Okay.

1185
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:26,283
You are asking me for this.

1186
01:41:27,053 --> 01:41:29,189
So I will pardon him for your sake.

1187
01:41:29,838 --> 01:41:31,057
Ask him to come here once tomorrow.

1188
01:42:17,829 --> 01:42:20,467
Father-in-law, please pardon me.

1189
01:42:22,604 --> 01:42:26,245
From now, I will never involve in..

1190
01:42:27,352 --> 01:42:28,882
..your personal matters.

1191
01:42:29,807 --> 01:42:31,528
If you stay good..

1192
01:42:32,341 --> 01:42:34,495
..why will we stay away from you?

1193
01:42:35,213 --> 01:42:37,565
Leave personal matters.

1194
01:42:38,836 --> 01:42:41,976
Don't forget that 
we are here for people.

1195
01:42:43,109 --> 01:42:45,651
Let's all work together unitedly.

1196
01:42:46,084 --> 01:42:47,710
Sure. Greetings.

1197
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,027
I am not habited to coffee and tea.

1198
01:42:58,175 --> 01:42:59,126
What's your plan..

1199
01:42:59,282 --> 01:43:02,473
..in gaining his confidence 
by working hard, Sir?

1200
01:43:02,733 --> 01:43:04,852
If we stay close to enemy..

1201
01:43:05,587 --> 01:43:07,014
..we can hit him hard.

1202
01:43:26,343 --> 01:43:27,856
Greetings, madam. 
- Greetings.

1203
01:43:27,936 --> 01:43:30,460
Please come. Come, madam.

1204
01:43:39,185 --> 01:43:40,241
Tell me. What happened?

1205
01:43:40,898 --> 01:43:42,057
Something is bad in eyes.

1206
01:43:42,137 --> 01:43:44,253
Since when? 
- Since this morning.

1207
01:43:44,893 --> 01:43:46,156
Please come once. I will check.

1208
01:43:55,868 --> 01:43:57,805
She went to hospital for pain in eyes.

1209
01:44:12,231 --> 01:44:16,019
We got confirmed news that..

1210
01:44:16,236 --> 01:44:18,096
..she went to hospital for 
confirmation on pregnancy.

1211
01:44:19,644 --> 01:44:21,867
If she gives birth to a boy..

1212
01:44:22,032 --> 01:44:24,047
..your complete family will finish.

1213
01:44:24,127 --> 01:44:27,437
Because, he will become the heir.

1214
01:44:27,671 --> 01:44:30,551
He will write all the assets to him.

1215
01:44:30,879 --> 01:44:34,235
Your inheritance will be given to him.

1216
01:44:34,416 --> 01:44:37,218
With that, your complete 
family will be gone.

1217
01:44:42,832 --> 01:44:46,724
For you, 
in the efforts of stopping her..

1218
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:49,018
..I need 100% support.

1219
01:44:49,098 --> 01:44:51,594
Not just 100%, you will get 1000%.

1220
01:44:52,225 --> 01:44:53,722
I am also with you, brother-in-law.

1221
01:44:57,786 --> 01:45:01,280
With this, the complete 
family will be in my fist.

1222
01:45:02,085 --> 01:45:04,152
They will listen to only what I say.

1223
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:06,695
What an idea, Mr. Babu. 
Why don't I get these?

1224
01:45:07,215 --> 01:45:10,769
If you also get them, you would 
have been in my place, right?

1225
01:45:12,508 --> 01:45:14,307
At first, what we need to do is..

1226
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:17,801
..to campaign negatively about them.

1227
01:45:18,944 --> 01:45:21,002
With some MLAs,..

1228
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:23,779
..we have to start rebelling.

1229
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,333
Look about it.

1230
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:33,353
Swamy.

1231
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:44,180
In TV and papers, they are saying that..

1232
01:45:44,803 --> 01:45:46,446
..I am the reason for the 
dissatisfaction in the party.

1233
01:45:47,052 --> 01:45:49,205
I will leave for few days, Swamy.

1234
01:45:50,183 --> 01:45:52,639
Lakshmi don't talk like stupid.

1235
01:45:53,089 --> 01:45:55,632
You are a wedded wife of mine.

1236
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:58,538
For the dramas that they 
are playing for expedience..

1237
01:45:58,832 --> 01:46:00,546
..why should we bend our heads?

1238
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:04,540
Not that, Swamy. 
Disgracing you for my sake..

1239
01:46:05,224 --> 01:46:06,789
..I am unable to bear it.

1240
01:46:07,991 --> 01:46:09,340
If I alone am not there..

1241
01:46:09,807 --> 01:46:13,146
..your family and your party cadre 
will be with you only, right?

1242
01:46:13,915 --> 01:46:14,711
Lakshmi.

1243
01:46:15,768 --> 01:46:17,418
You don't understand these politics.

1244
01:46:17,798 --> 01:46:18,923
I told you many times.

1245
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:21,483
You are raising the same 
conversation again and again.

1246
01:46:22,054 --> 01:46:23,649
Please try to understand.

1247
01:46:23,871 --> 01:46:27,260
They are repeatedly poking 
like crows. What do I do?

1248
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:29,276
I will go away, Swamy.

1249
01:46:29,526 --> 01:46:30,573
Lakshmi.

1250
01:46:34,517 --> 01:46:36,324
You asked me not to get defeated..

1251
01:46:36,574 --> 01:46:39,377
..and is it lawful for you to 
step backward? Lakshmi.

1252
01:46:40,025 --> 01:46:42,940
To make us suffer and to defeat us..

1253
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,929
..this is the plan of the opposition.

1254
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:48,319
If you leave because some 
guy wrote useless things..

1255
01:46:48,778 --> 01:46:50,585
..it will be like killing our soul.

1256
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:53,802
For this life, you are my wife.

1257
01:46:55,246 --> 01:46:57,867
I say this with proud and without fear.

1258
01:47:17,274 --> 01:47:19,289
You leave. He will check it.

1259
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:21,218
We will leave now, Sir.

1260
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:26,711
Please sit down.

1261
01:47:29,877 --> 01:47:31,987
What is Mr. Elder saying?

1262
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:42,323
All the works that 
we planned with eight MLAs..

1263
01:47:42,487 --> 01:47:45,445
..against the party came to his notice.

1264
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:48,974
He came to know about all 
the works that we planned for.

1265
01:47:53,099 --> 01:47:55,330
I could know that he is in doubt that..

1266
01:47:56,212 --> 01:47:58,132
..I am behind all this.

1267
01:48:04,367 --> 01:48:06,460
Today it happened to you eight of them.

1268
01:48:07,143 --> 01:48:09,011
Tomorrow it might happen 
to others as well.

1269
01:48:10,361 --> 01:48:12,765
Since you all are dear to me..

1270
01:48:13,197 --> 01:48:14,451
..I am telling you.

1271
01:48:15,178 --> 01:48:16,536
You spent so much money..

1272
01:48:17,064 --> 01:48:18,638
..in elections..

1273
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:20,851
..and to get them back..

1274
01:48:21,085 --> 01:48:24,691
..if you don't get what you need, 
then what is the way?

1275
01:48:25,461 --> 01:48:27,839
The confirmed news that came to me is..

1276
01:48:28,082 --> 01:48:29,604
..the whole money..

1277
01:48:30,054 --> 01:48:32,700
..is being eaten by 
Lakshmi Parvathi alone.

1278
01:48:33,876 --> 01:48:37,517
If it goes like this, 
then we are finished.

1279
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:41,262
So, removing him from his seat,,

1280
01:48:41,342 --> 01:48:43,407
..is the only way.

1281
01:48:43,892 --> 01:48:45,397
That is impossible.

1282
01:48:45,682 --> 01:48:49,591
You are saying this Babu, after seeing 
the popularity that he has in people?

1283
01:48:51,104 --> 01:48:54,529
There is only one way 
to make people believe.

1284
01:48:54,849 --> 01:48:58,334
Let's use Lakshmi Parvathi,..

1285
01:48:59,018 --> 01:49:00,687
..whom he believes a lot, as a knife.

1286
01:49:01,413 --> 01:49:02,468
How is it, Babu?

1287
01:49:03,074 --> 01:49:04,553
I will tell you. Listen to me.

1288
01:49:04,633 --> 01:49:07,433
First you three go and speak to him..

1289
01:49:07,513 --> 01:49:10,589
..that if she is not kept 
aside from party works..

1290
01:49:10,832 --> 01:49:12,968
..tell him that there will be 
disturbance in the party.

1291
01:49:13,048 --> 01:49:14,923
Tell him that there will be opposition.

1292
01:49:20,354 --> 01:49:22,283
We had to tell you 
as it is, elder brother.

1293
01:49:22,715 --> 01:49:25,041
That is, elder brother. 
Some people in the party..

1294
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,998
..are against you. 
The only reason for this is..

1295
01:49:30,394 --> 01:49:32,539
..Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi 
taking authority.

1296
01:49:32,619 --> 01:49:34,572
Lakshmi's authority? Where?

1297
01:49:35,099 --> 01:49:36,120
In which matter?

1298
01:49:36,447 --> 01:49:38,048
Can you tell me on whom did she show it?

1299
01:49:39,207 --> 01:49:41,317
With a frustration that I 
suspended them from party..

1300
01:49:41,706 --> 01:49:43,496
..as they couldn't 
say anything directly..

1301
01:49:43,964 --> 01:49:45,936
..they are talking with 
Lakshmi as the reason.

1302
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:48,436
But listening to someone else..

1303
01:49:48,516 --> 01:49:51,471
..do you think I am a 
fool to take decisions ..

1304
01:49:51,722 --> 01:49:53,123
..about party and people?

1305
01:49:53,468 --> 01:49:56,175
The only thing they want 
is authority and money.

1306
01:49:56,859 --> 01:49:59,332
Using that, they will 
steal people's money.

1307
01:50:00,873 --> 01:50:03,052
Since I am an obstruction to 
them, they are doing all this.

1308
01:50:03,649 --> 01:50:06,650
If Lakshmi was not there, they would 
have searched for some other reason.

1309
01:50:20,056 --> 01:50:21,405
It all happened as you said.

1310
01:50:21,743 --> 01:50:23,446
He didn't agree to send her away.

1311
01:50:25,081 --> 01:50:26,863
If he had agreed to it..

1312
01:50:27,218 --> 01:50:28,696
..what would have happened 
to our main purpose?

1313
01:50:31,681 --> 01:50:34,569
I sent you because 
I didn't want him to agree.

1314
01:50:37,804 --> 01:50:39,707
If this comes out any time..

1315
01:50:40,321 --> 01:50:45,224
..we will get a fame 
that we gave him a chance.

1316
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:13,106
Governor Sir, there is a lot 
of opposition against him.

1317
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:17,032
I have the majority of 
support in the party.

1318
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:23,112
No problem. The centre already 
asked me to support you in this matter.

1319
01:51:25,171 --> 01:51:26,494
Thank you, Sir.

1320
01:51:48,055 --> 01:51:50,096
It is true that there is 
opposition in the party, but..

1321
01:51:51,073 --> 01:51:52,950
..I doubt if they will oppose..

1322
01:51:53,512 --> 01:51:57,214
..him directly and support me.

1323
01:51:59,454 --> 01:52:02,775
The confirmed support 
that I have in MLAs..

1324
01:52:03,026 --> 01:52:04,609
..is only a few of them.

1325
01:52:04,851 --> 01:52:09,002
But the news that they are 
increasing hour by hour..

1326
01:52:09,305 --> 01:52:12,479
..should be publicised, using..

1327
01:52:13,041 --> 01:52:14,866
..your TV and paper.

1328
01:52:16,094 --> 01:52:18,939
Okay. 
- If you support me in this matter..

1329
01:52:19,387 --> 01:52:23,117
..not just in the form of 
money, but in other ways..

1330
01:52:23,393 --> 01:52:25,305
..also, I will give you that 
you can't even imagine.

1331
01:52:33,745 --> 01:52:37,429
In Viceroy hotel, with a tension 
that there are many MLAs..

1332
01:52:37,759 --> 01:52:39,869
..some more MLAs also..

1333
01:52:40,067 --> 01:52:41,261
..are changing their minds..

1334
01:52:41,341 --> 01:52:42,965
..and going to that hotel.

1335
01:52:43,045 --> 01:52:46,277
If this continues, from 
Mr. Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao..

1336
01:52:46,606 --> 01:52:49,261
..the power will change hands. 
This is experts thoughts.

1337
01:52:49,694 --> 01:52:52,859
There are many on Babu's side.

1338
01:52:52,939 --> 01:52:54,526
Observing all this.. 
- Sir, the situation..

1339
01:52:54,606 --> 01:52:56,688
..is going out of hands.

1340
01:52:56,768 --> 01:52:58,350
We need to find a solution 
for this problem.

1341
01:52:58,701 --> 01:53:02,796
Brother. I believe my MLAs.

1342
01:53:03,781 --> 01:53:07,538
All that is coming in TV is by 
that newspaper owner..

1343
01:53:07,984 --> 01:53:09,808
..and that cheater together..

1344
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:12,740
..is the drama that is being 
played to fool the people.

1345
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:16,821
The MLAs who won on my 
name will not cheat me.

1346
01:53:17,889 --> 01:53:20,294
Sir, more than the 
thought of cheating you..

1347
01:53:20,538 --> 01:53:22,876
..with the fake news 
coming in TV and paper..

1348
01:53:23,146 --> 01:53:25,484
..many MLAs will believe that..

1349
01:53:25,686 --> 01:53:29,538
..if all MLAs shift to Babu, 
they fear that they will be left alone..

1350
01:53:29,862 --> 01:53:32,443
..and it is known that everyone is 
joining Babu individually.

1351
01:53:32,523 --> 01:53:35,524
'What will Mr. NTR do 
in this situation is ..'

1352
01:54:19,483 --> 01:54:23,429
Chandrababu's leadership should win.

1353
01:54:23,509 --> 01:54:28,956
Chandrababu's leadership should win.

1354
01:54:29,186 --> 01:54:31,254
He demanded the Governor 
that he will prove that..

1355
01:54:31,334 --> 01:54:33,781
..he has the support 
of majority of MLAs.

1356
01:54:33,861 --> 01:54:36,538
The Governor has agreed for..

1357
01:54:36,618 --> 01:54:38,768
..floor test to prove his majority.

1358
01:54:41,187 --> 01:54:44,079
With a fear that they might change 
their minds listening to someone..

1359
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:46,876
..to keep them away from 
meeting anyone till floor test..

1360
01:54:47,241 --> 01:54:51,228
..all the MLAs were tied up in Viceroy 
hotel like a herd of sheep.

1361
01:54:57,931 --> 01:55:00,269
Swamy, you have to go there immediately.

1362
01:55:01,593 --> 01:55:04,458
Where? 
- To Viceroy hotel.

1363
01:55:04,701 --> 01:55:08,404
Tell them the matter and 
only you can bring them out.

1364
01:55:09,067 --> 01:55:13,458
Lakshmi, they were all selected by me.

1365
01:55:15,012 --> 01:55:17,660
They are the MLAs who 
won the elections on my name.

1366
01:55:18,417 --> 01:55:21,755
Should I beg them to stay with me?

1367
01:55:22,146 --> 01:55:26,335
Swamy, they are doing this either 
with fear or without knowledge..

1368
01:55:26,646 --> 01:55:29,146
..or by mistake, how do you know it?

1369
01:55:29,457 --> 01:55:30,876
Since they are your MLAs,..

1370
01:55:30,956 --> 01:55:33,646
..only you can explain them the matter.

1371
01:55:33,916 --> 01:55:35,767
What sister-in-law said is true.

1372
01:55:35,957 --> 01:55:37,578
Only you can do it.

1373
01:55:40,929 --> 01:55:42,118
Then fine.

1374
01:55:42,753 --> 01:55:43,577
Come.

1375
01:55:43,657 --> 01:55:48,172
Swamy, no. When they are saying 
that this issue is because of me..

1376
01:55:48,252 --> 01:55:50,780
..if I come even there, 
then it will do no good.

1377
01:55:51,023 --> 01:55:54,537
Lakshmi, my life is an open book.

1378
01:55:55,130 --> 01:55:58,603
Regarding me or regarding 
what I believe..

1379
01:55:58,793 --> 01:56:01,739
..if I hide anything, it will be 
like hiding me from myself.

1380
01:56:01,956 --> 01:56:05,037
For just seat if I hide this 
truth from the people..

1381
01:56:05,361 --> 01:56:07,402
..then, what is the difference 
between him and me?

1382
01:56:07,713 --> 01:56:10,091
Don't say anything. Just come with me.

1383
01:56:10,632 --> 01:56:15,429
Hail NTR.

1384
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:38,334
Babu, down, down.

1385
01:56:38,414 --> 01:56:42,646
Babu, down, down.

1386
01:56:42,726 --> 01:56:48,241
Babu, down, down.

1387
01:56:48,321 --> 01:56:53,876
Babu, down, down.

1388
01:56:53,956 --> 01:56:58,187
Babu, down, down.

1389
01:56:58,267 --> 01:57:00,903
Babu, down, down.

1390
01:57:00,983 --> 01:57:04,551
Babu, down, down. 
- The Chief Minister is here. Open gates.

1391
01:57:04,631 --> 01:57:08,686
This is a private place. 
You can't go inside. This is an order.

1392
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:11,889
You are all my brothers.

1393
01:57:12,118 --> 01:57:15,308
I selected you all with lots of love.

1394
01:57:15,388 --> 01:57:18,172
I am the one who made you stand 
in elections and gave you victory.

1395
01:57:19,226 --> 01:57:21,253
Don't believe his magic words.

1396
01:57:24,847 --> 01:57:27,658
There is nothing to be afraid of.

1397
01:57:28,322 --> 01:57:31,793
Come out with courage. 
I will explain you.

1398
01:57:35,252 --> 01:57:41,374
Babu, down, down.

1399
01:57:44,841 --> 01:57:47,670
How can you do injustice to me?

1400
01:57:50,374 --> 01:57:54,266
You grew up in my 
hands like my children.

1401
01:57:55,320 --> 01:58:00,104
You are living life given by me and now, 
you are combining hands with that cheater.

1402
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:04,644
Just look into yourselves once.

1403
01:58:06,185 --> 01:58:09,523
The history will never forget 
this betrayal of yours.

1404
01:58:10,293 --> 01:58:13,739
This cheating will be there lifelong.

1405
01:58:55,953 --> 01:58:59,588
Stop it. Swamy.

1406
01:59:06,116 --> 01:59:08,559
Who is it?

1407
01:59:26,601 --> 01:59:27,831
They killed me.

1408
01:59:29,669 --> 01:59:32,074
They killed me.

1409
01:59:32,777 --> 01:59:35,182
They killed me when I am alive.

1410
01:59:37,534 --> 01:59:39,074
In spite of being my sons..

1411
01:59:40,345 --> 01:59:42,088
..in spite of being my daughters..

1412
01:59:42,777 --> 01:59:44,831
..in spite of being son-in-laws..

1413
01:59:45,534 --> 01:59:48,710
..in spite of being the MLAs 
whom I gave victory..

1414
01:59:49,777 --> 01:59:53,034
..everyone combinedly.. 
- Swamy.

1415
01:59:53,114 --> 01:59:55,885
..hit me with slippers and killed me.

1416
01:59:56,668 --> 01:59:59,101
They killed me by hitting with slippers.

1417
01:59:59,181 --> 02:00:03,276
"Imposture, imposture."

1418
02:00:06,209 --> 02:00:08,574
"Cheating."

1419
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:14,614
"The belief, the belief.."

1420
02:00:15,845 --> 02:00:20,115
"They stabbed in the back."

1421
02:00:21,372 --> 02:00:30,237
"Insulted, insulted and 
stabbed in the back."

1422
02:00:32,101 --> 02:00:36,425
"Conspiracy, conspiracy."

1423
02:00:41,168 --> 02:00:45,074
"They hid and attacked fiercely."

1424
02:00:45,154 --> 02:00:49,060
"They spit the poison 
of dirty politics."

1425
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:53,141
"They showed fake love acting.."

1426
02:00:53,221 --> 02:00:56,721
"They gathered like 
Sakunis in kaliyugam."

1427
02:00:57,140 --> 02:01:01,019
"The atrocity was fired.."

1428
02:01:01,099 --> 02:01:05,019
"Is it possible to pardon?"

1429
02:01:05,221 --> 02:01:08,856
"Imposture, imposture."

1430
02:01:09,259 --> 02:01:20,020
(Music)

1431
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:25,492
"The dear ones fulfilled 
their necessity and left."

1432
02:01:26,088 --> 02:01:31,533
"They showed their originality 
and then bit mercilessly."

1433
02:01:31,857 --> 02:01:35,479
"They made lonely and 
attacked as a group.."

1434
02:01:35,992 --> 02:01:39,938
"They exiled from own house."

1435
02:01:40,127 --> 02:01:44,019
"Imposture, imposture."

1436
02:01:54,181 --> 02:01:56,465
I am very sad for what happened to you.

1437
02:01:56,965 --> 02:01:58,924
I know Babu well but..

1438
02:01:59,168 --> 02:02:01,857
..I didn't expect that he will 
stab you in the back like this.

1439
02:02:02,816 --> 02:02:04,397
It's not late even now.

1440
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:09,046
If they have to come under your 
control, you can do one thing.

1441
02:02:09,886 --> 02:02:12,627
What do I do? 
- Abolish the government.

1442
02:02:14,775 --> 02:02:15,937
What if I abolish it?

1443
02:02:16,017 --> 02:02:19,032
If you abolish it, everyone will lose the 
membership and elections will be re-held.

1444
02:02:20,254 --> 02:02:22,005
Your strength is people.

1445
02:02:22,288 --> 02:02:24,572
So you will be elected 
as Chief Minister again.

1446
02:02:25,208 --> 02:02:26,897
This will be a lesson for them.

1447
02:02:26,977 --> 02:02:28,762
If you give it in written form,..

1448
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:31,086
..I will go to Delhi, 
meet Prime Minister..

1449
02:02:31,166 --> 02:02:33,018
..and will recommend Governor.

1450
02:03:05,181 --> 02:03:06,654
Our action plan is ready.

1451
02:03:07,357 --> 02:03:09,316
I made him sign it.

1452
02:03:31,465 --> 02:03:33,708
Sir, your signature 
was used in other way.

1453
02:03:33,924 --> 02:03:38,722
If Assembly is dissolved, with a fear 
that you will not give them tickets..

1454
02:03:38,952 --> 02:03:41,425
..with the insult that 
you faced at Viceroy hotel..

1455
02:03:41,668 --> 02:03:44,857
..even the MLAs who changed 
their opinion supported Babu.

1456
02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:47,573
Even center needed the same. So..

1457
02:03:47,653 --> 02:03:49,884
..the Governor, without 
dissolving the government..

1458
02:03:49,964 --> 02:03:54,168
..Babu was given a chance 
to prove majority.

1459
02:03:57,047 --> 02:04:04,060
"You smashed the fort of 
justice and burnt it."

1460
02:04:07,704 --> 02:04:14,924
"You dig a pit and buried the justice."

1461
02:04:18,374 --> 02:04:22,856
"They hid like a jackal and.."

1462
02:04:23,769 --> 02:04:28,977
"..killed the self honor and burnt it."

1463
02:04:29,057 --> 02:04:32,923
"Imposture, imposture."

1464
02:04:33,769 --> 02:04:42,915
(Music)

1465
02:04:52,829 --> 02:04:57,229
(Crying)

1466
02:05:05,694 --> 02:05:07,789
Why are you crying Lakshmi?

1467
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:17,534
Seeing your situation, 
I am unable to bear it, Swamy.

1468
02:05:25,264 --> 02:05:29,183
Lakshmi, everyone is concerned 
about their selfishness.

1469
02:05:30,170 --> 02:05:31,845
Look at my children.

1470
02:05:32,845 --> 02:05:36,102
They combined hands with the 
one who stabbed me in the back.

1471
02:05:37,845 --> 02:05:39,561
Is it for them that..

1472
02:05:40,223 --> 02:05:42,845
..I melted myself..

1473
02:05:42,925 --> 02:05:45,534
..and gave out my life?

1474
02:05:46,385 --> 02:05:48,993
What wrong did I do?

1475
02:05:49,898 --> 02:05:52,912
Why are they torturing me like this?

1476
02:05:53,181 --> 02:05:55,073
Your heart knows..

1477
02:05:55,397 --> 02:05:56,992
..that you did no wrong.

1478
02:05:58,262 --> 02:05:59,762
Even now, I can't understand..

1479
02:06:00,168 --> 02:06:03,708
..the loss that I did to the party.

1480
02:06:04,681 --> 02:06:07,843
Lakshmi, the mouth of lies is bigger.

1481
02:06:08,141 --> 02:06:09,952
The hands of injustice are longer.

1482
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:14,411
Even if you were not in my life..

1483
02:06:15,263 --> 02:06:19,276
..they might have cheated 
me in some other way.

1484
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,168
Now they used you. That's it.

1485
02:06:31,006 --> 02:06:32,357
Don't cry.

1486
02:06:33,452 --> 02:06:37,992
Swamy, I am unable to see you..

1487
02:06:38,797 --> 02:06:41,032
..crying like this.

1488
02:06:43,937 --> 02:06:46,897
There is only one solution 
for this problem.

1489
02:06:47,803 --> 02:06:52,046
People believed you and voted for them.

1490
02:06:52,938 --> 02:06:55,397
They stabbed in the back,..

1491
02:06:56,208 --> 02:06:58,722
..but it's not you that they 
stabbed but the people.

1492
02:06:59,952 --> 02:07:01,925
The people who gave you authority..

1493
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:06,438
..you have to tell them about this.

1494
02:07:17,223 --> 02:07:22,331
The dirty politics 
is worse than adultery.

1495
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:25,710
It is a crime against people.

1496
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:28,858
It is bigger crime than 
betraying the country.

1497
02:07:29,386 --> 02:07:34,846
I am not myself. I am my people.

1498
02:07:35,387 --> 02:07:37,982
Those people made me this today.

1499
02:07:38,861 --> 02:07:41,644
But, today, he,..

1500
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:46,388
..with dirty politics, 
with machination and deceived..

1501
02:07:47,077 --> 02:07:49,036
..they stabbed me on my back.

1502
02:07:49,523 --> 02:07:53,780
He stabbed not my back but my people.

1503
02:07:54,469 --> 02:07:58,185
That's why, to explain the 
injustice done to my people..

1504
02:07:58,265 --> 02:07:59,942
I am going to roar like a lion.

1505
02:08:02,956 --> 02:08:05,632
I will invite lakhs of people..

1506
02:08:05,712 --> 02:08:08,754
..and will disclose his actual 
figure in that meeting.

1507
02:08:08,997 --> 02:08:13,564
Hail Mana Desam. 
- Hail Mana Desam.

1508
02:08:18,104 --> 02:08:21,550
There's meet in evening. 
Make arrangements. - Greetings, Babu.

1509
02:08:22,365 --> 02:08:23,383
What happened?

1510
02:08:23,463 --> 02:08:25,793
There's meet in Vijayawada, 
Simhagarjana.

1511
02:08:25,873 --> 02:08:28,292
On the political issues that 
happened in last few days..

1512
02:08:28,372 --> 02:08:31,711
..because of media support, 
our intelligence says that..

1513
02:08:31,791 --> 02:08:33,441
..many people will be attending it.

1514
02:08:33,521 --> 02:08:36,292
When he declared in the meeting, 
that he will marry Lakshmi Parvathi..

1515
02:08:36,752 --> 02:08:39,063
..seeing the response he got..

1516
02:08:39,684 --> 02:08:44,712
..after Simhagarjana meeting, 
people will attack us like an eagre.

1517
02:08:47,941 --> 02:08:49,901
What if we don't give 
permission for meeting?

1518
02:08:50,252 --> 02:08:53,293
It will be like, we declaring 
the stabbing by ourselves.

1519
02:09:01,589 --> 02:09:03,440
People are his strength.

1520
02:09:04,210 --> 02:09:06,075
You have to keep them 
at a distance from him.

1521
02:09:07,899 --> 02:09:12,237
Rama, Rama, Ram.

1522
02:09:12,317 --> 02:09:16,656
Rama, Rama.

1523
02:09:16,736 --> 02:09:21,129
Rama, Rama.

1524
02:09:21,345 --> 02:09:25,872
Rama, Rama.

1525
02:09:26,169 --> 02:09:30,426
Rama, Rama.

1526
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:36,480
To stop our meeting 
and our arrangements..

1527
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:38,615
..it came to our knowledge that 
they are planning differently.

1528
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:44,939
Then, there is no need of making 
any kind of arrangements.

1529
02:09:45,385 --> 02:09:49,939
Directly, I will talk to my 
people from my van.

1530
02:09:50,479 --> 02:09:52,370
We have truth on our side.

1531
02:09:53,479 --> 02:09:55,883
Nobody can stop truth.

1532
02:09:55,963 --> 02:09:58,802
As per my view, it is better 
if you don't conduct the meeting.

1533
02:09:59,435 --> 02:10:02,072
Why that? 
- People might not come at all.

1534
02:10:03,438 --> 02:10:05,546
Why will people not 
come for his meeting?

1535
02:10:05,788 --> 02:10:08,950
Because when they come from different 
places to attend your meeting,..

1536
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:10,842
..and after hearing your words..

1537
02:10:11,031 --> 02:10:14,234
..the people might rebel on 
them and with this fear..

1538
02:10:14,423 --> 02:10:17,126
..we came to know that he is going to 
use goons and police for this.

1539
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:27,600
In my age of more than 70 years..

1540
02:10:28,843 --> 02:10:32,776
..if I turn back and 
look at my life once..

1541
02:10:33,870 --> 02:10:37,911
..the only mistake that 
I did in my whole life..

1542
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:42,019
..is trusting him.

1543
02:10:43,398 --> 02:10:46,776
For believing that single cheater..

1544
02:10:47,276 --> 02:10:49,979
..I came to this position.

1545
02:10:50,884 --> 02:10:53,587
The MLAs who won with my name..

1546
02:10:54,073 --> 02:10:55,979
..he converted them as his weapon.

1547
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:59,492
My children..

1548
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:03,506
..and my family went against me..

1549
02:11:06,087 --> 02:11:07,830
Swamy. 
- Brother.

1550
02:11:08,939 --> 02:11:11,510
Swamy.

1551
02:11:12,074 --> 02:11:13,504
Swamy.

1552
02:11:13,584 --> 02:11:21,191
(Crying)

1553
02:11:21,655 --> 02:11:22,655
Swamy.

1554
02:11:24,439 --> 02:11:26,911
I can't bear seeing you like this.

1555
02:11:28,305 --> 02:11:32,317
I will die, if I see you like this.

1556
02:11:35,364 --> 02:11:37,681
Even when you said, 
I didn't hear you..

1557
02:11:37,924 --> 02:11:40,830
..and for asking you to take him back,..

1558
02:11:41,384 --> 02:11:45,667
..please pardon me for this.

1559
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:48,113
No, Lakshmi.

1560
02:11:50,167 --> 02:11:53,573
I know that you told this for my good.

1561
02:11:55,303 --> 02:11:59,181
But he is a snake who 
drinks milk but spits poison.

1562
02:12:01,249 --> 02:12:05,695
Even after knowing that, 
if I made him join my team..

1563
02:12:08,088 --> 02:12:10,100
..that means, should I sold my wit..

1564
02:12:40,185 --> 02:12:43,453
(Crying)

1565
02:12:59,437 --> 02:13:00,639
Lakshmi..

1566
02:13:02,995 --> 02:13:05,193
..sleep beside me today.

1567
02:13:36,618 --> 02:13:37,640
Mother.

1568
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:45,802
Come here and sleep on my chest.

1569
02:13:59,694 --> 02:14:01,816
Are you sad, dear?

1570
02:14:07,505 --> 02:14:11,992
As long as you are beside me, 
I will not have any sadness, Swamy.

1571
02:14:15,803 --> 02:14:17,060
Lakshmi.

1572
02:14:18,897 --> 02:14:22,965
I lived well in my life.

1573
02:14:23,573 --> 02:14:26,870
I gave entertained 
people, as an actor.

1574
02:14:28,013 --> 02:14:32,397
I gave true rule, as a leader.

1575
02:14:32,870 --> 02:14:36,114
I always tried for their safety.

1576
02:14:37,627 --> 02:14:40,289
But, only one..

1577
02:14:42,114 --> 02:14:45,992
..for believing one person, 
I ruined myself.

1578
02:14:50,553 --> 02:14:53,479
I feel like vacuum.

1579
02:14:55,736 --> 02:14:57,506
Lakshmi.

1580
02:14:58,114 --> 02:15:02,438
Don't go anywhere, anytime, leaving me.

1581
02:17:39,201 --> 02:17:40,112
Swamy.

1582
02:17:41,666 --> 02:17:42,747
Swamy.

1583
02:17:45,801 --> 02:17:48,044
Swamy, Swamy.

1584
02:17:49,368 --> 02:17:50,557
Sister Kamala.

1585
02:17:51,807 --> 02:17:53,274
Swamy.

1586
02:17:58,056 --> 02:17:59,288
Swamy.

1587
02:18:12,976 --> 02:18:15,440
Sir, oh, no. 
- Doctor.

1588
02:18:16,089 --> 02:18:19,544
Sir, what happened?

1589
02:18:19,624 --> 02:18:22,327
Say something, Sir.

1590
02:18:23,764 --> 02:18:27,436
Swamy, say something. 
- Sir.

1591
02:18:30,446 --> 02:18:32,133
Swamy please get up.

1592
02:18:38,058 --> 02:18:41,398
Yes, Sir. He is not speaking.

1593
02:18:46,314 --> 02:18:48,963
Doctor, Swamy.

1594
02:18:50,317 --> 02:18:52,152
Let me check.

1595
02:19:00,677 --> 02:19:01,388
Sorry.

1596
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:07,298
Swamy.

1597
02:19:09,839 --> 02:19:12,664
Swamy please get up once.

1598
02:19:13,183 --> 02:19:17,420
(Wailing)

1599
02:19:37,864 --> 02:19:39,030
Swamy.

1600
02:19:40,643 --> 02:19:41,962
Daddy.

1601
02:19:50,395 --> 02:19:53,420
Swamy 
- Daddy.

1602
02:19:54,222 --> 02:19:55,461
Swamy.

1603
02:19:57,498 --> 02:20:02,741
(Wailing)

1604
02:20:10,136 --> 02:20:11,920
Swamy.

1605
02:20:23,068 --> 02:20:26,920
Move away. Move.

1606
02:20:28,095 --> 02:20:29,217
Daddy.

1607
02:20:31,122 --> 02:20:32,528
Swamy.

1608
02:20:43,715 --> 02:20:44,881
Move.

1609
02:22:29,113 --> 02:22:36,497
(Wailing)

1610
02:22:36,703 --> 02:22:38,122
Swamy.

1611
02:23:02,461 --> 02:23:03,718
Swamy.

1612
02:23:13,867 --> 02:23:15,380
Swamy.

1613
02:23:25,502 --> 02:23:29,638
Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama.

1614
02:23:30,042 --> 02:23:34,286
Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama.

1615
02:23:34,677 --> 02:23:38,488
Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama.

1616
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:45,421
For this life, life or death 
is with you, Swamy.

1617
02:23:47,029 --> 02:23:50,489
Leaving you is like 
more than death to me.

1618
02:23:51,556 --> 02:23:56,935
Please don't punish me for 
the mistake that I have not done.

1619
02:23:58,583 --> 02:24:05,179
Lakshmi. I decided not to die.

1620
02:24:07,395 --> 02:24:09,287
As long as you are alive..

1621
02:24:10,936 --> 02:24:14,665
..I promise that I will be alive.

1622
02:24:19,071 --> 02:24:26,531
"Pardon me, Lakshmi. 
Pardon me, Lakshmi."

1623
02:24:27,332 --> 02:24:31,030
"Pardon me, Lakshmi."

1624
02:24:32,180 --> 02:24:42,436
"I gave you a word but couldn't 
stand by it. I am leaving now."

1625
02:24:43,170 --> 02:24:52,679
"I had to leave my dear's 
love and leaving away."

1626
02:24:53,787 --> 02:25:01,097
"Pardon me, Lakshmi. 
Pardon me, Lakshmi."

1627
02:25:02,745 --> 02:25:07,961
"I was crushed in the bad wits.."

1628
02:25:08,041 --> 02:25:12,028
"..and I am setting now."

1629
02:25:12,218 --> 02:25:17,434
"Leaving the net of 
conspiracy and tricks.."

1630
02:25:17,602 --> 02:25:21,528
"..I am leaving now."

1631
02:25:22,262 --> 02:25:29,991
(Music)

1632
02:25:30,435 --> 02:25:38,001
"Leaving you alone and 
pushing you into sadness.."

1633
02:25:38,284 --> 02:25:47,974
"..I broke my heart and leaving crying."

1634
02:25:48,337 --> 02:25:52,407
"I am leaving now."

1635
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:56,515
"Pardon me, Lakshmi."

1636
02:25:56,906 --> 02:26:00,190
"Pardon me, Lakshmi."

1637
02:26:09,961 --> 02:26:12,648
His body must have died..

1638
02:26:12,851 --> 02:26:19,756
..but a great man's soul always 
lives in the hearts of people.

1639
02:26:20,176 --> 02:26:22,811
For authority and for glory..

1640
02:26:22,891 --> 02:26:27,257
..under the leadership of a man, 
seeing whom even demons feel shy..

1641
02:26:27,635 --> 02:26:35,163
..because of the betrayal 
done by some animals..

1642
02:26:35,498 --> 02:26:39,191
..who are in the incarnation of humans..

1643
02:26:39,271 --> 02:26:42,239
..a great man like Rama, Mr. NTR..

1644
02:26:42,595 --> 02:26:46,771
..was sacrificed for the mental torture 
and the true replica is..

1645
02:26:47,028 --> 02:26:48,584
..this Lakshmi's NTR.
