1
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,240
Arti!

2
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,200
Arti!

3
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
Where are you, Arti?

4
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Where are...?

5
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,960
So you are here!

6
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,560
I know the reason why you pretend
to be reading the 'Ramayana'.

7
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,160
You don't visit tempIes,
but read the 'Ramayana'.

8
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,080
I know you've hidden your
son's photograph in it.

9
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,800
Haven't you?

10
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,200
It has been six years now.
He isn't going to return now.

11
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,560
Forget him.

12
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,080
Stop such siIIy acts.

13
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,880
What's the use of keeping Ravana's
photograph in the 'Ramayana'?

14
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Moreover, why shouId one feeI
so much for a son...

15
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,320
...who is responsibIe for
his own father's death?

16
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,880
For one who has deprived you
of your husband!

17
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,640
Now Iook...a chiId who has entered
the worId of crime once...

18
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,720
...he never returns home.

19
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,680
AII gIories to our
Ieader Hari Prasad.

20
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,120
I don't want to thank you just
because you've got me eIected.

21
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,880
I want to thank you because
you have eIected me...

22
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,080
...despite the Iure of weaIth
and the threat of Iife.

23
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,360
My victory marks the defeat
of the gun.

24
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,280
My victory is a defeat for those
who want to misIead...

25
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,320
...the youth of our country and turn
them against there own motherIand.

26
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,040
I chaIIenge aII those who have
compromised their patriotism...

27
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,400
...in exchange for arms
and ammunition...

28
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,680
...they couId perhaps pierce
our hearts with their arms...

29
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,520
...but they can never
shatter our unity.

30
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
Unity is the need of
the hour today.

31
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,360
Father!

32
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Father!

33
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
Move away!

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,000
The bike is not working.

35
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
He is a youth of our country.

36
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,960
There's fury and hatred
in his eyes.

37
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,520
He has murdered four Ieaders,
committed nine dacoities...

38
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
...and Iooted twenty
eIection booths.

39
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,360
So many crimes at
such a young age!

40
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,960
The question whether he has
become a criminaI on his own...

41
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,680
...or has he been Ied into it.
DefiniteIy, he has been Ied into it.

42
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
And a foreign power and a
speciaI gang is behind it aII...

43
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,560
...which is enticing youth
aged between 15 and 22 years...

44
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
...and giving them guns. And
especiaIIy during eIections...

45
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,560
...in the name of reIigion or caste,
or under some other pretext...

46
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,480
...they cause riots
and vioIence.

47
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
Why do these outside powers
come to our country?

48
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,720
If there are traitors within
our own country...

49
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,840
...a foreign power is bound
to take advantage of it.

50
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,760
You are a recognized officer
of the secret service.

51
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,760
You're the pride of our country.
But is it not a matter of shame...

52
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,640
...that your poIice department hasn't
been abIe to identify the gang too.

53
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,160
You've just arrested one
youth named BaIIu.

54
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
But he's not an ordinary youth.

55
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,640
His arrest is our first step
towards the goaI.

56
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,440
And it's my promise...

57
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,400
...and aIso that of the poIice
department to my countrymen...

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,880
...that we wiII soon eIiminate
this dangerous gang...

59
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,600
...and restore peace in our country.

60
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,680
Does this BaIIu BaIram
have his parents?

61
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,320
Investigations are under progress.

62
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,480
There's a Iimit to siIIiness.

63
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,200
It has been six years but the son has
not even enquired for her weII-being.

64
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,240
But his mother washes his cIothes
every fourth day waiting for the day.

65
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Why so?

66
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,560
So that when BaIIu comes and goes to
work, his cIothes shouId be cIean.

67
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,600
Aren't you peopIe ashamed?

68
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Her famiIy has been ruined.
Her onIy son has Ieft her.

69
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
- And you're Iaughing on her?
- The onIy son?

70
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,560
The one who shoots
peopIe at random?

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,360
I wouId've kiIIed such a son
without a thought.

72
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,760
You don't have a son.
That's why you can say that.

73
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,720
You wouId know when
you become a mother.

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,920
- Is there any news about BaIIu?
- Let's go home. I wiII teII you.

75
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,440
According to BaIIu's statement...

76
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,880
...neither does he have parents,
nor brothers or sisters.

77
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,240
But he does have a Iover.
Her name is Sophia.

78
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
EarIier, she was into modeIing
and dancing in New DeIhi.

79
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
- Where is she now?
- She is missing.

80
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Find her.

81
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,840
I'm Sophia speaking. If BaIIu is
hanged to death...

82
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,080
...I wiII commit suicide.

83
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,200
Don't be crazy. BaIIu is
our dearest soIdier.

84
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,520
And he is my heartbeat.

85
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,640
He's our first soIdier who was caught
because of a fooIish person.

86
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,000
I know that the Secret Service,
scared of us...

87
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,160
...is shifting BaIIu from one
jaiI to another continuousIy...

88
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
...so that we don't get to know in
which jaiI he has been Iodged.

89
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,840
But they don't know that BaIIu
reaches farther than the Iaw.

90
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,000
So he wiII return.
He wiII sureIy return.

91
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Anyway, I'II be coming
over to see you.

92
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,640
Mr. Prakash...I wiII ensure your
victory in the eIections.

93
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,280
But it wiII cost you
two crore rupees.

94
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,080
BaIIu's arrest can be
dangerous for you.

95
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,000
I was born in a house which
was caIIed danger.

96
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,640
I'm teIIing you the truth.
My motor-bike went out of order.

97
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
- By then, the poIice arrived.
- But the motor-bike beIonged to you!

98
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,960
Because of your smaII mistake,
I suffered such a big Ioss.

99
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,080
Forgive me.

100
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,160
Does one ask forgiveness Iike this?

101
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,520
Forgive me. I won't commit
such a mistake again.

102
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:04,760
It happens. It happens.
That's the way it is.

103
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,640
- Where's Munna?
- He's missing.

104
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes. It has been reported on
teIevision that...

105
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,800
...the court has sentenced BaIIu
to twenty years imprisonment.

106
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,520
He has been sentenced to twenty
years imprisonment.

107
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,680
It wouId've been better if he
had been hanged to death.

108
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,680
At Ieast you wouId've stopped weeping
and waiting for him every day.

109
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,760
Now you shouId assume
your son as dead.

110
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,280
And now you are aIso
dead for him.

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
He has even said in his statement
that you are dead.

112
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,080
A scoundreI who decIared his
Iiving mother as dead...

113
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,240
...forget such a
rascaI son!

114
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
How can I forget? How?

115
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
He's my son!

116
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,720
In every drama of Iife...

117
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,720
...there is the hero.
And there is a viIIain.
118

118
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,520
Wasn't I right when I said that...

119
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,720
...BaIIu wouId never reveaI my
whereabouts at any cost?

120
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,760
I hear that the Chief of the Secret
Service is a smart pIayer.

121
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,360
There is no pIayer in India
who couId defeat BaIIu.

122
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
After aII, BaIIu is my discipIe.

123
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
You're the first criminaI in my
career who I'm reaIIy fond of.

124
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,720
What did you find so
attractive in me, Sir?

125
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,040
- Your honesty.
- What do you mean?

126
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm a viIIain. And
you're a hero.

127
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:36,400
It's a matter of our professions.
Both are honest about it.

128
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,640
That's the reason why I want to
make an honest deaI with you.

129
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,800
- DeaI?
- Yes.

130
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,760
Of mutuaI benefit.

131
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,280
If it's beneficiaI,
teII me quickIy about it.

132
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,080
Mr. Pandey, teII him.

133
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,240
Look, the deaI invoIves a give
and take from both parties.

134
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,800
Mr. Ram wiII get your 20-year
imprisonment reduced to 2 years.

135
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,240
- 2 years?
- How is that to be done...

136
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,240
- ...is entireIy Mr. Ram's outIook.
- Then what wiII I have to do?

137
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:33,480
You'II have to teII your bosses' name
and address to us in confidence.

138
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,120
This matter wiII be restricted
between the three of us.

139
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
- That's my guarantee.
- How wonderfuI!

140
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,880
This is a deaI between
the hero and the viIIain.

141
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,480
ReveaI now, and go home
two years Iater.

142
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,160
SIeep, and Iet sIeep.

143
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,920
ShaII I pIace my trust?

144
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,200
If you don't want to, don't reveaI.
We've other ways of knowing.

145
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,240
No, Sir. This is a
profitabIe deaI. But...

146
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,160
Anyhow, pIease come...

147
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,520
- Where?
- Pick a pen and paper.

148
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,120
Write down.

149
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,600
First go to DeIhi. From DeIhi,
go to Srinagar in Kashmir.

150
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,120
From Srinagar, one has to go to
PahaIgam in a jeep.

151
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,280
From PahaIgam, go to KhiIanmaI. From
there, waIk for about 30 kiIometers.

152
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,080
- Where?
- Up above the mountain...

153
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,760
-...there's a tempIe.
- A tempIe!

154
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,520
- Amarnath's tempIe.
- Yes.

155
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,480
One has to go there crawIing.

156
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,080
Further down, you wiII find
an idoI of Shiva made of ice.

157
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,520
You wiII have to rub your nose
in its presence for nine times.

158
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
And you wiII have to pray to Lord
with cIosed eyes...

159
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,760
- Pray what?
- That 'O Lord...'

160
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,400
'...pIease make this fooI
BaIIu to reveaI to you...

161
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,160
...the whereabouts and
identity of his boss...

162
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,680
...and if there is some miracIe
from there, I wiII teII you.

163
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,000
What's this, ChoteIaI?
Is this home-made bread?

164
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Sir, the bread is home-made.
But the fIour is from jaiI.

165
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,200
- Are you Iistening?
- Yes, I'm Iistening.

166
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,160
Your daughter has sent this
photograph from America.

167
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,880
- See?
- Yes, I see.

168
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,600
She writes that she wouId marry
none other Ram Kumar Sinha. Or eIse...

169
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,120
...wouId she commit suicide?
Ask her to wear cIothes first.

170
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,240
In America, this is how peopIe dress
up. She's a modern girI, after aII.

171
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,560
But Ram is not modern. He has given
his heart to Ganga since ages.

172
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,520
To heII with Ganga.
Is that how a girI is?

173
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,480
- Is she a boy then?
- Yes, she's a boy.

174
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,000
- Which boy are you taIking of?
- PIease be seated.

175
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,520
She was saying that...

176
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,200
...even if we are your distantIy
reIated UncIe and Auntie...

177
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,600
...stiII, we've come so cIose to
each other in a matter of one month.

178
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,360
Yes, I'm giving you
so much troubIe.

179
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,520
Not at aII.

180
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm yours. UncIe is yours.
And Tiny is yours. Look!

181
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,480
- No!
- Why?

182
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,440
- No, it's nude.
- I'm nude?

183
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,840
I'm nude. I mean...It's nude!

184
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,640
What're you doing, UncIe?

185
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:44,520
ActuaIIy, she wants to know
when you intend to marry.

186
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,000
Look, UncIe. TiII I don't arrest
BaIIu's boss...

187
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,520
...I've taken a pIedge
not to marry tiII then.

188
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,400
Why did you caII me, Sir?

189
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,240
Do you recognize this boy?

190
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,760
TeII me, yes or no?

191
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,160
What shouId I say?
Yes or no?

192
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,400
It's me!

193
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,560
Hey! He's Munna. He's my Munna!

194
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Yes, he's your Munna, who
works in your gang.

195
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,000
He doesn't know your Ieader.
He knows you.

196
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,000
And today he has stated that
on the coming 19th...

197
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,480
...you and your gang wouId've
murdered the High Court judge...

198
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,120
...and on the 21st, you wouId've
bombed the CoIIege buiIding.

199
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,920
TeII us, is it true or faIse?

200
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,440
Munna, you toId them the truth?

201
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,880
Yes, he aIso said that
you've a mother...

202
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,360
...who's Iiving, and who
stays in some viIIage in U.P.

203
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,440
But you've aIways maintained that
your parents died five years ago.

204
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,600
- It's correct.
- Then is he Iying?

205
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,640
I don't say that he's Iying.
He's a fooI. He's a kid.

206
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,960
Munna, the oId woman that you
met that day, she's not my mother.

207
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,560
Sir, I address any oId
woman as my mother.

208
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,720
I'm an orphan. So sometimes I Iike
to use the word Mother.

209
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,560
And just Iook at him...Munna, you got
scared of a few of their beatings.

210
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,360
Look how much they've beat me.

211
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,440
It's their job to beat, and
our job is to bear the beatings.

212
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,640
It's not our job to
turn a state witness.

213
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,240
And Sir, you are beating
such a young feIIow?

214
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,200
Even his face is swoIIen.

215
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,320
If you wanted to, you couId
have beaten me. Why beat him?

216
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,560
Don't worry. Don't weep.

217
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,440
You couId've beaten me, Sir.

218
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,360
ScoundreI, you've
become a state witness?!

219
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,680
Leave him!

220
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,280
ScoundreI!

221
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,600
KiII me.

222
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,760
My job has been done!
KiII me. KiII me!

223
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,240
I've kiIIed your witness.

224
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,160
I've kiIIed your witness.
My job has been done.

225
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Thank you for having
brought me here.

226
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,840
My job has been done.

227
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,160
The government has expressed
concern upon the murder...

228
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,560
...of Munna Yadav, who had
turned a state witness.

229
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,760
The government has stated that it is
doing its best to catch the gang.

230
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,440
- Yes?
- The speciaI news...

231
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,000
...is that the poIice had
arrested Munna from Kanpur...

232
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,920
...and had taken him
to Mumbai from Kanpur.

233
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,520
You beat me so much! Sometimes, you
shouId serve Iiquor too with food.

234
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,720
Have you seen this stick
of the Iaw?

235
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,760
If you ask for Iiquor, Mr. Ram wiII
thrust the stick down your throat!

236
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,880
Is this a stick of the Iaw?
Let me see it.

237
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,640
- Is it Mr. Ram's stick?
- Yes.

238
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,280
Give it to Mr. Ram. Ask him to take
it home and pIay it Iike a fIute.

239
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,720
- ScoundreI!
- You caIIed me a scoundreI?

240
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,720
- Yes. I caIIed you a scoundreI.
- You caIIed me a scoundreI!

241
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,440
He has become very carefree
these days, Sir.

242
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,720
Fetch a Iiquor bottIe from
the viIIage nearby.

243
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
- You've a Iot of strength, do you?
- What happened?

244
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,840
- You're feeIing very haughty!
- TeII me what's the matter?

245
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,320
You're feeIing very excited!
You attack a cop? You act bossy?

246
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,160
Move back!

247
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,600
You act very bossiIy, is it?

248
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,680
You want to drink Iiquor?

249
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,400
Come on, drink it!

250
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,240
You want more?

251
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,720
You're feeIing very haughty!
Show me your muscIes!

252
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,640
Look at the physique
of the cop too!

253
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,000
Look! Look at this!
Look at the cop's physique!

254
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,800
Now Iook at the cop's strength!
You've beaten a Iot of peopIe!

255
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
You kiIIed Munna with these
very hands, didn't you?

256
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,120
Show me your strength!

257
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,440
Come on! Show me your strength!

258
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,320
Show me your strength, ScoundreI!

259
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,360
Eat it! You want
Iiquor with food?!

260
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,680
You beat the constabIe, didn't you?

261
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,200
You beat the constabIe!

262
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,160
You kiIIed Munna!
Now feeI the suffocation of death!

263
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,000
This is how the
suffocation of death is!

264
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,600
How dare you hit a cop!

265
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,680
Sir, this is improper!

266
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,520
Never raise your hand on a cop!

267
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,160
Understand! Don't you?

268
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,280
Did you get any Iesson?

269
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,120
First teII me why he beat me?

270
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,200
He beat you because
you beat a poIiceman.

271
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:35,640
Then teII him that BaIIu
beat a poIiceman again!

272
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,120
- Is it painfuI?
- No, it's enjoyabIe.

273
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,560
- Mother!
- You remembered mother?

274
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,120
If you mess around with the poIice,
you'II remember your grandma too!

275
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,160
Give it. Stand outside.

276
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,320
Come on, get up! Get up.
Drink miIk. Come on!

277
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,360
You're feeding miIk
to a snake.

278
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm feeding miIk to a person
who's trying to be a snake.

279
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,200
Drink.

280
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,680
You've a unique styIe!

281
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,600
Sometimes this...sometimes this.

282
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,680
How wonderfuI!

283
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,440
I respect your mind
and you're daring.

284
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,280
AIas! OnIy if you were my brother,
I wouId've asked you...

285
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,080
...whether or not you reaIize
what you are doing?

286
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,240
You're acting as a tooI for
the nation's enemies...

287
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,960
...you're stabbing your
own motherIand.

288
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,160
Mr. Ram, since you've addressed
me as your brother...

289
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,120
...you shouId hear
my true feeIings.

290
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,960
Look, you are a government officer.

291
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,160
So you wiII speak of your country
and the motherIand.

292
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,640
But there are so many government
officers and Ieaders...

293
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,440
...who fiII their own pockets
in the name of the motherIand...

294
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,560
...who fire buIIets at poor peopIe,
and deprive them of their Iiving.

295
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,680
You know that, and so do I.

296
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,760
You cannot use the dishonesty
of some peopIe...

297
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,080
...and use it as a defense for your
turning into a traitor...

298
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,200
...and nor can you estabIish what
is wrong to be right.

299
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,400
A wrong is aIways wrong.

300
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,200
Wrong and right...it's onIy
an individuaI's perception.

301
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,800
In your view, I'm a viIIain.

302
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,840
In my view, you're a viIIain.

303
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,400
Your devotion and dedication
is your country, your government.

304
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,280
My devotion and dedication
is my gang, my boss.

305
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm not a hero,
I'm a viIIain.

306
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,760
What're you thinking?

307
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,160
Someone has poisoned your
mind to such an extent.

308
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,320
I've reaIized today how
dangerous that monster must be.

309
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,720
I swear...I wiII see to it that
I wiII make you reveaI.

310
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,040
I'II eIiminate that scoundreI!

311
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,320
Then you had better
hear my warning too.

312
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,760
The one whom you consider as a
monster, I treat him as my guru.

313
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,360
And I take my guru's oath...

314
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,200
...exactIy five days from now,
I'II escape from your jaiI.

315
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,960
On 10th October at 10 o'cIock,
I'II vanish from your prison.

316
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,600
Because I've taken an
oath of my mother!

317
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
You'II meet that monster after
escaping from the jaiI.

318
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,040
This desire of yours
wiII never be fuIfiIIed.

319
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,040
And if you do escape...

320
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:06,720
...Ram Sinha wiII forget his worId,
his peace of mind.

321
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,600
The onIy objective of my Iife
wiII be to bring you back here...

322
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,960
...Iiving or dead.

323
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,040
10th October. At 10 in the
night. I wiII be out.

324
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,840
You'd better tighten
the security.

325
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,320
Tighten security?

326
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,600
There's no need to tighten any
security. He's just threatening.

327
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,000
Threatening?

328
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,160
The waIIs of my jaiI are weak,
the Iocks are weak, I'm weak.

329
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,000
If he does escape on 10th October...

330
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,200
...I'II Iose my job, my house,
and my wife too.

331
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,680
- How wiII you be deprived of me?
- That's because you've become used...

332
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,440
...to feasting on free fruits,
provisions and butter at the jaiI.

333
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,480
TeII Verma that before
9th October...

334
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,440
...aII the waIIs, bars, and the
bricks shouId be strengthened.

335
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,360
It's an order!

336
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,920
Mr. BaIIu!

337
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,600
Today, it is 1 1th October,
2 o'cIock in the night.

338
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,240
These peopIe are waiting
for you to escape.

339
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,200
I used to think that you peopIe
have been appointed here...

340
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,360
...because of your capabiIities
and your inteIIigence.

341
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,560
I didn't know that you wouId take
a prisoner's oath so seriousIy.

342
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
What do you mean?

343
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,520
Mr. Pandey, you peopIe
thrashed me so severeIy...

344
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,480
...you made Iife miserabIe for me.

345
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,920
So I thought of a way of making
Iife miserabIe for you.

346
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,760
I got the opportunity and
I chaIIenged you of my escape.

347
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,880
And you got taken in by it.

348
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,440
You got down to the job
for five days.

349
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,480
You continued to work and
I continued to think.

350
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,160
Congrats.

351
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,600
I'm not a hero,
I'm a viIIain.

352
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm not a hero,
I'm a viIIain.

353
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,120
- HeIIo, ViIIain.
- What is it, Vamp?

354
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,880
TeII me, when wiII you speak to
Ram about Tiny's marriage?

355
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,560
- I wiII speak to him.
- When wiII you speak to him?

356
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,080
Over there, Ram is speaking to
Ganga in Nasik on the phone.

357
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,800
How dare you caII me a bitch!

358
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm Joseph speaking.

359
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,760
I'm Ram Sinha speaking.
CaII Ganga over the phone.

360
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,800
She cannot come here. But
the phone can go to her.

361
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,280
Here it goes...it's going.

362
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,760
Here...Iisten now.

363
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,200
This woman caIIs me a bitch!

364
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,400
AII these are abuses of
the oId times.

365
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,040
What kind of a woman are you?

366
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,040
I'm this kind of a woman.

367
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,760
And if you make me more angry,
I wiII hang over upside down.

368
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,960
This is not your home that
you puII at each other's hair.

369
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
- What is it?
- It's a phone.

370
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,440
Say that I'm not here.
Ganga is dead and gone.

371
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,560
- Have you heard, Sir?
- Yes, I have heard.

372
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,680
PIease hoId on. She wiII
sureIy come. She wiII herseIf come.

373
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,760
Why wiII I come myseIf?
Am I maidservant?

374
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,200
Mr. Ram's eyes are
weIIing with tears.

375
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,280
What is it? Why do you have
to shed tears over this?

376
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,800
It has been 10 days. You didn't
even teIephone once!

377
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,960
I know what duty is.
I too perform my duties...

378
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,320
Keep those rascaIs tied up.

379
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,760
- Listen...
- What shouId I Iisten?

380
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,800
- Keep standing!
- AII right. I've stood up.

381
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,840
I was saying that...

382
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,160
I don't want to speak
to you about anything.

383
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,560
- It's UncIe speaking.
- My greetings.

384
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,840
BIess you!

385
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,480
Ram is very worried.

386
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,160
I wasn't teIIing you.

387
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,960
I was addressing the constabIe
who was standing behind me.

388
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,520
He's coming to meet you
at Nasik this evening.

389
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,000
UncIe! TeII him there's
no need to come here.

390
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,720
As it is, I'm attending my
friend's marriage tonight.

391
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,960
Yes, the marriage tonight...

392
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,400
- If you receive a nice thrashing...
- It's meant for you.

393
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,920
I don't want to hear anything.

394
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,720
Whatever you want to say,
come here and say.

395
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,280
This evening, I wiII...

396
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,560
Ganga has arrived.

397
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,640
So you've come, Ganga!
But you've been deIayed!

398
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,760
We got deIayed whiIe returning
from the tempIe.

399
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,160
Ganga is appearing
very beautifuI today.

400
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,880
She shouId. After aII, it's the
marriage of our friend.

401
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,840
Why not? AII you friends are the
pride of the marriage.

402
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,080
Ganga, you wiII be dancing and
singing today, won't you?

403
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,760
Why me? It's Champa who is
a master in dancing.

404
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,880
She goes to every viIIage
with her dance troupe.

405
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,760
I've Iearnt dancing from her.

406
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:42,280
She Iearnt dancing so weII that she
won the goId medaI too this time!

407
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,040
Ganga's Ram has arrived.

408
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,400
- Where?
- There!

409
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,440
- O Lord! I'm Ieaving.
- Listen...

410
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,040
- Let's get him today.
- Yes, Iet's go.

411
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,680
- Where's Ganga?
- Ganga is not here.

412
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,080
Yes, she's not here.

413
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,640
I know that she's here.

414
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,280
Don't fooI around with me.
I've to return soon.

415
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,720
If you don't teII me,
I'II go away.

416
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,320
Listen....we wiII have
to find her a IittIe.

417
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,440
- What do you mean?
- Come aIong with me.

418
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,040
Where are you taking me?

419
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,320
- Where is she?
- Be seated here.

420
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,640
- We wiII go and find her.
- PIease don't fooI around with me.

421
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,480
I've to go back.
I'm in a hurry.
423

422
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,600
This is not right.

423
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,760
You come and go away. But Ganga has
to hear peopIe's criticisms.

424
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,000
- What's the matter?
- That Ram has made so much...

425
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,360
...progress in the past five years
that he wouIdn't marry Ganga now.

426
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,560
- Ganga is no better than a keep.
- Auntie!

427
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,080
Then what? Ganga's mother
died in her chiIdhood.

428
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,840
Then her father got kiIIed. She has
been working ever since...

429
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,320
...and Iiving with her auntie. How
Iong couId she continue Iike this?

430
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,520
Remember, after a certain
point of time...

431
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,120
...a young girI Iiving with her
guardians is acceptabIe...

432
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,560
...onIy if she has
aIready got married.

433
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,360
Now you've to think
about it, not me.

434
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,160
Don't mind what auntie said.

435
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,120
She has Iost her sense of thinking
working in the hospitaI.

436
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,360
Auntie is right.

437
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,600
If appIying vermiIion is marriage,
then I'II appIy it right away.

438
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,960
TeII everybody that Ganga has
become Ram's wife from today.

439
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,920
There's a message for you at
the poIice station here.

440
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,000
- What's the message?
- BaIIu has escaped from the prison.

441
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,000
He escaped by throttIing to death
the constabIe neck...

442
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
...who used to visit him every
night to serve miIk.

443
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,440
Then he donned his uniform and
sIipped out of the jaiI in the night.

444
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,360
BaIIu has escaped from
the government's prison.

445
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,720
It's the wonder of my cats!

446
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,480
BaIIu has come out.

447
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,560
BaIIu escaped from prison.
Who's responsibIe for it?

448
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,120
Is it you, the poIice department
or the jaiI empIoyees?

449
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Let us do our duty. We wiII
teII everything at the right time.

450
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,880
You and the poIice department shouId
hang your heads in shame.

451
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:00,400
- Is the government suspending you?
- Ask the government.

452
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,600
Is it not true that on the day
when BaIIu escaped from prison...

453
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,200
...you were roIIicking
in your Iover's arms?

454
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,600
I am aware of my duty.

455
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,680
You've no right to attack
my personaI Iife.

456
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,320
Aren't you ashamed of misusing
the power of the pen?

457
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,080
You caught hoId of a
journaIist by the neck?

458
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,080
- You manhandIed a press person?
- You raised your hand on him!

459
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,200
Ram Sinha! Shame!

460
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,520
We're ruined. That scoundreI
ran away and destroyed Ram.

461
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,480
Nobody can destroy Ram. I wiII
go and catch BaIIu.

462
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,040
You?

463
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,480
Yes, you can bring him. You've
caught criminaIs earIier too.

464
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,000
For the sake of Iove,
take the pIunge.

465
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,000
No, we cannot assign you
this responsibiIity.

466
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,880
We wiII need the heIp of many
states to arrest him.

467
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,760
- But sir...?
- Just a minute.

468
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,600
The Iatest is that he's hiding
somewhere in our state itseIf.

469
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,160
Continue the search.

470
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,800
What're you saying? You want
to jump in the weII of death?

471
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:31,720
Yes. I can do anything
for my Ram's respect.

472
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,400
I want your heIp.
WiII you heIp me?

473
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,080
The poIice is on the aIert...

474
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,600
...on aII airports, raiIway stations
bus stands and highway check-posts.

475
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,960
So you'II have to proceed by stopping
at the pIaces of the peopIe...

476
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,080
...mentioned on this paper,
exactIy as per scheduIe.

477
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,920
After about 15 to 20 days,
we wiII reach Vishakapatnam.

478
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,040
From there, Roshiba
and Sophia wiII...

479
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:05,000
Did you get to know anything
about my mother?

480
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Yes. She has Ieft your
actuaI viIIage...

481
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,600
...and has gone to another
viIIage with a Mr. Shaukat.

482
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,400
It is not known which
viIIage she has gone.

483
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,520
Who is he?

484
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,000
He is an oId foIIower
of our boss.

485
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,200
He's aIso the Ieader
of this region.

486
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,800
We had ensured his victory
in the previous eIections.

487
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,760
Today, he has come to
invite us to his home.

488
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,840
Sir, at my bungaIow today, the most
beautifuI dancing girI...

489
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,120
...wiII be performing her act. It
wiII be my good fortune if you come.

490
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,280
A dance and a dancing girI?
Not at aII. I'd better stay away.

491
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,320
I hear that the
dancer is sensationaI.

492
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,560
Is it? SensationaI?!
495

493
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,000
- My pistoI with you? How come?
- I found it in your suitcase.

494
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,360
- You opened my suitcase?
- Yes.

495
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,760
What do you want?

496
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,760
I Iike you a Iot.
WiII you come with me?

497
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,360
How is that possibIe?
First teII me who you are.

498
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:12,640
I'm a ruffian, a kiIIer.
A criminaI on the run.

499
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,200
The decent peopIe caII me a viIIain.

500
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,880
You appear to be
a truthfuI person.

501
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:33,280
So what? Even I'm addressed by
decent peopIe as a prostitute.

502
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,360
This type of a prostitute?

503
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,720
Who is beautifuI, brave, and
who keeps a pistoI too?

504
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,960
Who knows when one comes
across a scoundreI.

505
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,320
It's empty. Keep it there.

506
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,920
I keep it for my protection,
what eIse?

507
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,480
But I've Iiked you.
How much do you earn?

508
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,560
100 rupees. For dancing
for a night. Why?

509
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,920
- WiII you accompany me?
- Where?

510
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,760
- To Singapore.
- To ShoIapur?

511
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,600
To Singapore. Its
outside India.

512
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,640
What's the use?

513
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,720
A thousand rupees for
one night's dance.

514
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,120
In a big hoteI. I've pIenty of money.
I've cars, a big bungaIow.

515
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,040
I've everything.

516
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,360
And what if I don't come?

517
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,560
I wiII take you by force.

518
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,840
You don't even know
how to woo a girI!

519
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,480
Open your other eye too.
Look me into the eyes.

520
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,640
AII right. Now, teII me.
WiII you accompany me?

521
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,360
- You won't cheat on me?
- No.

522
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,040
- Take an oath.
- OnIy Iiars take oaths.

523
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,400
You are right.

524
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,400
The poIice is reaching here
within 15 minutes.

525
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,560
TeII me, darIing.
Now or never.

526
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,600
My advance first.

527
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,280
Give her troupe a sum
of 30,000 rupees.

528
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,080
But why are you taking
aIong this beauty?

529
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,040
BaIIu has become fond
of this beauty.

530
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,200
The journey wiII be enjoyabIe.

531
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,640
- ReaIIy?
- Yes.

532
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,720
She herseIf took the pIunge
in this dangerous game.

533
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,600
I tried my best to convince her.
But she didn't Iisten.

534
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,080
We performed dances
in severaI homes.

535
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,440
FinaIIy, we found him there.

536
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,200
And when we found him,
the poIice reached Iate.

537
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,440
- By then, she had gone with him.
- She hasn't done the right thing.

538
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,000
You don't reaIize what a
dangerous criminaI he is.

539
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,440
I just know that Ganga can pIay with
aII kinds of danger for your sake.

540
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,200
And she is aIready
pIaying with danger.

541
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,280
Who served beer to Ganga?

542
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,840
Speak up, drunkard!

543
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,560
Give me a pistoI.

544
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,440
What kind of a
constabIe are you?

545
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,360
- Why did you make our girI weep?
- Just a minute. Listen to me.

546
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,280
- I'm not a constabIe.
- Then who are you?

547
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,560
I'm a fiIm actor.

548
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,600
I'm performing a constabIe's roIe
in the shooting that's going on.

549
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:10,320
- I'm Ganga.
- Ganga who?

550
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,000
Your mother!

551
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,680
Mother? Mother!

552
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:23,000
It has been years since you passed
away. Where are you caIIing from?

553
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,320
You oId man! Give the
phone to my BabuI!

554
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,640
What's this combination
of Ganga and BabuI?

555
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,480
I'm Ganga!

556
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,200
PIease caII my BabuI.

557
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,840
I'm Ram speaking.

558
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,760
I swear, this Ganga is yours.
And she wiII aIways be.

559
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,120
So what if I've run
away from home?

560
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,520
I'II return home some day.

561
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,440
Are you aII right?

562
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,120
- I'm perfectIy fine.
- In whose company are you?

563
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,440
I'm in Mr. BaIIu's company.
He's a very nice person.

564
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,240
Yes, I'm in safe hands.
Don't worry at aII.

565
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,560
Come back. Come back.

566
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,720
This game is not meant for you.
It's not a good game.

567
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,040
Where are you?

568
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,720
I'm caIIing from Kinara HoteI
on the BeIapur Road.

569
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,040
- How Iong wiII you be there?
- We are going to Mirzapur now.

570
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:02,240
We aren't going to Mirzapur,
but to DhoIpur in Gujarat.

571
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,400
- Who are you?
- I'm the Gangaram of your Ganga.

572
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,800
My name is BaIIu.

573
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,520
Why did you Iie to my BabuI
that we're going to DhoIpur?

574
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,960
DarIing...we are criminaIs
on the run.

575
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,280
Even the poIice can hear
our conversation over the phone.

576
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,240
Ah, yes!

577
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,560
He is with her.

578
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,440
He wiII sureIy go to Mirzapur.
582

579
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,480
It wiII be dawn soon. And you
haven't stopped boozing stiII?

580
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,960
You were Iooking very
beautifuI Iast evening.

581
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,520
- So?
- I couIdn't sIeep the whoIe night.

582
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,640
Why?

583
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,120
- I was thinking about you.
- What were you thinking?

584
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,040
I was thinking as to
what is this Ganga?

585
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:43,680
Is she eIegance, stirring, kindness,
nobiIity, divinity, rebeI...

586
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,720
...fire, water,
breeze or a fIood?

587
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,840
What exactIy is this Ganga?

588
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,280
Then I thought...whatever it is,
it is something known as Iove.

589
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:06,240
And today this BaIIu is going
bonkers about this sensation.

590
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:08,960
What are your intentions?

591
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,080
To embrace you and die.

592
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,680
Move away! You've boozed
a Iot. Go and sIeep.

593
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,240
You Iove me, don't you?

594
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,120
- Yes.
- I too Iove you.

595
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,080
I'II take you to a tempIe
tomorrow and marry you.

596
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,280
You'II become my wife.

597
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,760
- I wiII. But tomorrow.
- No, today.

598
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,440
Today BaIIu has come
to you Iike a bee.

599
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,800
You're my rose-petaI!

600
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,080
You may assume that we are
aIready married. AII right?

601
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,320
The poIice has surrounded us
from aII sides.

602
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,520
Get up, Ganga. The enemy
has attacked.

603
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,960
Now we've to take the same pIedge.
We'II Iive and die together. Right?

604
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,640
- Yes.
- Let's go.

605
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,720
Let's go.

606
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,080
Come on.

607
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,040
He has escaped.

608
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,400
- Come here.
- He is trapped.

609
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,240
The poIice has surrounded us.

610
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,960
Where were you?

611
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,680
- Come on. Come with me.
- Me? Where?

612
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:13,920
Look, our Iives are in danger.
Stay cIose to me.

613
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,000
No, Ieave me.

614
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,840
Leave you? Didn't we take a
pIedge to Iive together?

615
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,560
Come on.

616
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:29,200
Don't misunderstand me, Sir.

617
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:34,400
She's Ganga, my wife.
If you wish, you may fire.

618
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:39,240
But the first buIIet wiII hit her.
It wiII hit a woman.

619
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,600
You saved me weII.

620
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,040
These are poIicemen. They
can never fire at a woman.

621
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,560
ShaII I fire?

622
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,120
Bravo!

623
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,040
Come on! Come on!

624
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,920
He has run away!

625
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,640
Where is BaIIu? If you don't,
I wiII make Iife miserabIe for you.

626
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,880
He hasn't returned home
since the past six years.

627
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,840
- TeII me!
- I don't know anything.

628
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,040
Any of his friends.
Somebody must've come.

629
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,640
- Nobody came.
- You're Iying.

630
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:26,480
I'm not Iying. I don't
know where BaIIu is.

631
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,760
I don't know. I don't know.

632
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,480
- You are...
- What're you doing?

633
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,880
What say, Ganga? You wouId
marry me, won't you?

634
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,160
Come on. Let's get married
in this tempIe itseIf.

635
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:08,440
But before that, you wiII have
to teII me about your famiIy.

636
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,600
Why? Don't you know?

637
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,600
I'm a dancer!

638
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:19,480
- A dancer?!
- Yes.

639
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,200
Or one who makes other dance?

640
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:32,520
TeII me truthfuIIy. Your name,
your work, your residence.

641
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,000
You won't? I wiII teII you.

642
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,600
ShaII I teII you the
reaI name of this dancer?

643
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,040
- Yes, go ahead.
- Look...

644
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,160
It is an officiaI card.

645
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:55,160
And it contains her photograph too.

646
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,160
And it indicates her reaI name.

647
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:07,600
Profession: Sub-Inspector
in Nasik JaiI.

648
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:17,000
Now you wiII ask me how I got
hoId of this identity card.

649
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,240
That night, when you were singing
this song, I entered your room.

650
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,880
I found the pistoI in your suitcase,
and the identity card was under it.

651
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,240
You continued to pIay with me,
and I continued to pIay with you.

652
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,560
The way you protected me today,
I Iiked it a Iot.

653
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:48,720
Keep protecting us Iike a
shieId just Iike this.

654
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,160
And if the poIice comes,
you face the first buIIet.

655
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,840
I'II face the second one.

656
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,440
We wiII Iive together.
We wiII die together.

657
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,280
TeII me, wiII you deceive me?

658
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,040
WouId you deceive me?

659
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,400
No! You won't!

660
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,720
She won't deceive! She won't!

661
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,800
Come on...weIcome her!
WeIcome Ganga, the poIicewoman.

662
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,720
Sound the beIIs!

663
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:59,440
It has been wonderfuI! BaIIu is
in demand aII over the worId.

664
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,280
BaIIu wiII be owner of miIIions
once he reaches Singapore.

665
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,640
And you wiII be his darIing.

666
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,880
He's in Maan Singh's mansion right
now, 800 miIes from here.

667
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,760
Didn't I say that I wiII
not eat the food? Never!

668
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,400
TeII BaIIu that when
Ganga Ieft home...

669
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,760
...she was prepared
for death.

670
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,320
And today too, I am
not scared of death.

671
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:25,920
I dare you Iift the gun
and eIiminate me right away!

672
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,560
- You mean you won't eat food?
- No, I won't.

673
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,200
I won't eat the food of you sinners
even tiII my Iast breath.

674
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:39,400
She wiII eat the food.
She wiII sureIy eat.

675
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,680
Do you think that an indication
of friendship is a man's weakness?

676
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,920
Neither wiII I kiII you with
a gun, nor with a sword?

677
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:40,120
Look at this! Do you
know what it is?

678
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,400
It's a bIade.

679
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:48,880
With this bIade, I wiII first
cut your Iips from here...

680
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,640
...then from here, then from
here, and then from here.

681
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,000
I wiII ruin your face and
then burn you aIive.

682
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,040
No!

683
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,080
Look!

684
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,200
You're a decent poIicewoman.

685
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,520
Be decent and Iet us reach
our destination...

686
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:08,520
...and then we wiII
Iet you go aIive.

687
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,840
There's aIso a 50 per cent chance...

688
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:18,480
...that you couId get us arrested
in the name of friendship.

689
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,280
Serve food to her.

690
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,480
Listen to me carefuIIy.

691
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,240
This voice is of BaIIu's boss...

692
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:58,520
...who has forced you and your
men to roam about aII over.

693
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:03,400
You'd better reIease the four men
that you've arrested recentIy.

694
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,240
BaIIu has just caused you
sIeepIess nights.

695
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:09,080
But I wiII make your Iife miserabIe.

696
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,400
So what if you may have not one
but 200 bodyguards.

697
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:19,240
You mad dog! What's the daring
in barking over the phone?

698
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:23,640
Come face to face!

699
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,520
Come to my home, come
to my office...

700
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:31,120
...come on the open road.
But do come!

701
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,520
And you won't find any bodyguard.

702
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:38,160
You wiII just get
Ram Sinha's body.

703
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,840
He disconnected the connection.
He disconnected it!

704
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:55,120
You coward! Dog! ScoundreI!
TeII me where you want to come?

705
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:00,600
TeII me, ScoundreI!

706
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,880
TeII me, where do
you want to come?

707
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:19,400
- An urgent report.
- What is it?

708
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:24,160
BaIIu's mother is aIive.
She's in our custody presentIy.

709
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,920
This is her fiIe and
her photographs.

710
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,280
How wiII it be of any heIp?

711
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:35,760
You wiII keep his mother
in your custody?

712
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,760
You wiII make announcements
on teIevision or radio?

713
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,000
You think that the heartIess
man wiII be infIuenced?

714
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,080
A monster who decIared her
Iiving mother as dead...

715
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,600
...why wouId he bother
about her mother?

716
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,000
- But Sir, if his mother...?
- The same nonsense again?

717
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,280
Throw it away!

718
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,680
I won't spare you!
You know everything!

719
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:25,440
Answer me! You'II have to speak!

720
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,280
Who came to meet you?
Where is your son?

721
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,960
TeII me. I wiII kiII you.

722
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,880
What is this method of
conducting an enquiry?

723
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,600
She's BaIIu's mother. She's
the mother of a terrorist.

724
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:53,760
Yes, I am BaIIu's mother.
I'm a sinner's mother.

725
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:58,760
KiII me. Hang me to death.

726
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:06,120
Hang me to death.
KiII me! KiII me!

727
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:12,160
This woman won't stay here.
She wiII Iive at my home.

728
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,520
How can he take the mother of such
a dangerous criminaI to his home?

729
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:22,840
He can. Because BaIIu's case is in
the hands of C.B.I. and Ram Sinha.

730
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:27,320
- What couId be his intention?
- There must be something.

731
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,560
But this secret shouId
be restricted to us.

732
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,520
Why did you get the
doors cIosed?

733
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:45,120
Because I want to speak
to you in private.

734
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,960
CaIm down. Take these medicines.
I wiII expIain everything.

735
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:51,680
My son, BaIIu, has Ieft me
six years ago.

736
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:55,560
- I don't know anything.
- Take the medicine at Ieast.

737
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:01,040
I don't want medicine. PIease
Iet me go to my viIIage.

738
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:02,560
ViIIage? Where?

739
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,880
Yes.

740
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,080
To Mr. Shaukat's pIace
or to Shambhu Master?

741
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,400
Do you know him?

742
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,520
Look at this! Look!

743
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,200
Isn't he Shambhu Master?

744
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,840
The one who used to sing the
song 'O Maa Tujhe SaIaam'?

745
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,040
And this is you?!

746
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:32,320
Yes...I was a teacher, Sir.

747
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,840
And he's your son, BaIIu?!

748
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:40,160
Yes, my son BaIIu.

749
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,360
And this is BabIa...he was
his friend, wasn't he?

750
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,280
Yes, I used to teach
both of them.

751
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,600
And I am that BabIa!

752
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,400
Yes.

753
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:06,640
Yes, the same orphan who couId
study tiII the eight standard...

754
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,680
...with the fees paid by you
and with books given by BaIIu.

755
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,840
Then he came to the city
and became an officer.

756
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,800
- You became an officer?
- Yes.

757
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,320
And the same officer is
searching for your son.

758
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,960
In that case, you can
save him, can't you?

759
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,320
Yes, but I wiII need your
heIp for this.

760
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,080
Where is he now?

761
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,760
I wiII be staying for
2 to 3 days with the madam.

762
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,720
Keep me informed here.

763
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,520
We wiII meet BaIIu tonight
at the farmhouse.

764
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,480
EIections are in progress
at Sheikhpura.

765
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,560
BaIIu wiII pass through that
area in a poIiceman's uniform.

766
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,640
RascaI! You dared to go and vote
against our candidate!

767
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,520
Everybody has been ordered
not to come out of their homes.

768
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,680
We wiII have to go through
from here.

769
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,600
HeIp us, Inspector. Saraswati's son
is being beaten up by crooks.

770
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,760
- Why are they beating him?
- MaIIu Singh...

771
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,080
...the most notorious crook
of this viIIage...

772
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,880
...is contesting the eIections
against this viIIage's Sarpanch.

773
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,200
He has restricted viIIagers
from casting their vote.

774
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,720
Crooks are stamping the papers
on their own.

775
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:28,160
Somebody pIease save my son!

776
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,160
Brother!

777
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:34,400
We'II not get invoIved in this
compIication. Let's go.

778
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:39,040
Inspector, pIease save my son.
Or they wiII kiII him.

779
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,720
PIease save my brother!

780
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,080
Beware! Don't beg for heIp
from the cops!

781
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:51,120
What was the crime of my son?

782
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,720
He had gone onIy to
cast one vote.

783
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,120
I wiII sureIy go. MaIIu Singh
is a crook. He's a dacoit.

784
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:03,400
Sukhram is a nobIe person.
Every person has a right to vote.

785
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,200
You can scare other
viIIagers, not me.

786
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:08,040
What did you say?

787
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:13,120
Look, he has been beaten enough.

788
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:18,160
Now you may go, stamp the papers,
induIge in Iooting, enjoy yourseIves.

789
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,520
Get Iost, wiII you? Don't you know?

790
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,880
The cops have been given
a Ieave of two hours.

791
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,880
- Listen to me, at Ieast.
- What did you say?

792
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:32,920
ScoundreI! How dare you raise
your hand on a cop?

793
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,920
Keep your mouth shut.
Or you too wiII be deaIt with!

794
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,400
- Get Iost from here!
- What did you say, BaIdy?

795
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:57,040
MaIIu Singh! Shame Shame!

796
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,760
AII gIories to
the Inspector!

797
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:07,680
- MaIIu Singh! Shame Shame!
- AII gIories to the Inspector!

798
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:13,360
MaIIu Singh! Shame Shame!
AII gIories to the Inspector!

799
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,440
I'm cornered!

800
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,040
Brother!

801
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:13,040
- I've removed the buIIet!
- It's paining severeIy.

802
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,320
CouId the poison have spread?
You're suffering from high fever.

803
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,720
Did you get to know anything
about a doctor or a hospitaI?

804
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,320
The neighboring viIIage is under
curfew. There are cops aII over.

805
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:31,400
Where is Ganga?

806
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:37,480
- Ganga escaped with the motor-cycIe.
- What? Catch her!

807
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,840
Dead or aIive! Go!

808
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,080
I've brought the doctor.

809
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,760
But why are you standing here?
Come on...Iie down.

810
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,400
- And you...pIease come.
- Yes, yes.

811
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:38,880
She's not here.

812
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,360
Mother!

813
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,480
Mother!

814
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:53,800
Mother!

815
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:10,400
-Underneath Your Bed...
-There is a bottIe of Iiquor.

816
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:14,760
,- Give it to me.
- I won't Iet you drink today.

817
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:16,120
Give me the Iiquor!

818
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:36,800
Whatever you have done for me today,
I thank you for that.

819
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:43,680
But if you think that I wiII
Iet you go home, you're mistaken.

820
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,040
AII right?

821
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,600
- ShaII I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

822
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,680
Looks Iike you Iove
your mother a Iot.

823
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:58,440
How can you be so sure?

824
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,520
When you were screaming with pain,
you were caIIing out for your mother.

825
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,760
So?

826
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:06,880
In times of pain and misery...

827
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:11,360
...one caIIs out the name of a
person who is most dear to him.

828
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:16,000
- Who toId you that?
- Ram says so.

829
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,360
Ram who?

830
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:24,120
You mean Lord Rama?

831
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:30,320
- So you beIieve in Lord Rama?
- Yes, he's my Iord.

832
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,480
You Iove your mother
a Iot, don't you?

833
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,200
I don't know.

834
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,280
I suppose your mother is aIive.

835
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:44,120
- She is. And she is not.
- I don't understand.

836
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,440
It has been 6 years since I saw her.

837
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:52,640
He can forget me.
But I can't forget him.

838
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,280
It means BaIIu didn't come
to see you since 6 years?

839
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,760
He hasn't.

840
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,960
- Any of his friends. Any message?
- None.

841
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,560
What happened 6 years ago?
Why did he Ieave you and go?

842
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,600
- The worId of crime.
- The worId of crime?

843
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:09,040
How did he enter the worId
of crime? Through his father?

844
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:14,160
His father? His father was a
respected Iawyer.

845
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:18,920
His grandfather had sacrificed
his Iife for the country's freedom.

846
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,720
Then why did BaIIu start
kiIIing others?

847
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:26,720
A monster had cast his eviI
eye on him since his chiIdhood.

848
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:29,520
Which monster?

849
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:36,880
- Who is he?
- His Master.

850
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:41,080
I stiII remember...when
BaIIu was very young...

851
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:46,680
...that monster had visited
our home on a DiwaIi day.

852
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,720
Greetings, Madam.

853
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,880
- What is aII this?
- It's nothing.

854
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,960
It's just sweets and
crackers for the chiIdren.

855
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,560
Speak cIearIy.
What's the matter?

856
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:06,800
That poIice commissioner
has accused me...

857
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:10,640
...of having incited vioIence
and having burnt down coIonies.

858
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,680
You're representing the
government in this case.

859
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,400
If you Iike, you can save me.

860
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,520
You mean you are trying
to bribe me?

861
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,920
Trying? I'm not trying.
I'm offering you bribe.

862
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:28,720
We are poor peopIe. But
we are not a broken tree.

863
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,920
Our famiIy roots are very strong.

864
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,200
Even my roots were very strong.

865
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:41,280
But after freedom, the storm
of weaIth uprooted my roots.

866
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:48,480
But my roots are strong.
And they wiII continue to be.

867
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:54,520
Court matters are discussed
in courts, not at home.

868
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,720
Is it?

869
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,240
Come on, pick up everything.

870
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,320
Greetings.

871
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,880
Hey, why are you hiding it?

872
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:13,520
Son, take this. Take aII of this.
I had brought aII this for you.

873
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,200
But...

874
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:19,800
It doesn't matter.

875
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:23,280
It happens. It happens.
That's the way it is.

876
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,400
The roots are strong.

877
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:31,920
I don't know whether
they wiII remain strong.

878
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:38,280
Greetings to aII of you.

879
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:41,600
May you Iive Iong.
Good Iuck, Son!

880
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:48,040
Mother!

881
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,880
He's just a kid!

882
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:52,960
He embarrassed me in that
thief's presence.

883
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:56,360
AII kids fire crackers
on the DiwaIi day.

884
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,120
If you don't bring crackers
for him, what wiII he do?

885
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,920
Your bIind Iove wiII ruin him.

886
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,560
One day, you wiII hear dynamite
in these very crackers.

887
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:13,960
Don't weep, BaIIu. Don't.

888
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:23,480
She aIways Iied to father
for my sake.

889
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:31,760
Mother Ioved me too much.

890
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:35,960
And father hated me too much.

891
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:39,960
If there was anybody who understood
me correctIy to some extent...

892
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,160
...it was my eIder sister,
who was a sociaI worker.

893
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,240
Is it true that you had gone
for a job with Roshan Mahanta?

894
01:56:58,600 --> 01:56:59,640
Yes, it is true.

895
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,360
You know, don't you, that he has
served a 6-year imprisonment?

896
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,760
I know.

897
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:09,000
And that he makes young boys
seII hashish and cocaine?

898
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,600
- I know.
- StiII you wiII work for him?

899
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,360
Yes, I wiII.

900
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:19,760
- Why?
- Because I've ten expIanations.

901
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:23,840
One, mother has grown oId
teaching at schooI.

902
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:28,200
Two, peopIe have rejected
father being an honest Iawyer.

903
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:31,600
Three, you haven't got a job
since the past two years.

904
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:35,400
Four, Father can recommend,
but he won't...

905
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,720
...because he is the son of
Mahatma Gandhi's friend.

906
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:44,080
- You wiII work for Roshan Mahanta?
- Yes, I wiII.

907
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,760
The grandson of Jagannath Prasad,
India's revoIutionary...

908
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:54,480
...wiII seII cocaine for
Roshan Mahanta?

909
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,080
That sign on the road
is of your father.

910
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:09,720
...whose rent hasn't been paid
since the past 10 months.

911
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,720
...whose son hasn't received
admission in coIIege since 2 years.

912
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:17,360
You are sitting under
this famiIy sign.

913
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,720
I want to sit on a sign where...

914
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:24,000
...everybody, from a peon to
a minister, makes money.

915
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:25,600
OnIy money!

916
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:42,480
Ever since that day, he became
a sIave to Roshan Mahanta.

917
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:48,160
Yes! I preferred Roshan
Mahanta's sIavery...

918
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,080
... than being a sIave to poverty.

919
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,760
Once I was jaiIed. And my own
father refused to baiI me out.

920
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:58,520
Roshan Mahanta had come
to reIease me.

921
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:04,080
That was my Iast day.

922
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:09,400
I asked mother if she
wouId come with me.

923
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:12,920
- She said...
- No!

924
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:19,360
A woman's reaI home is
her husband's home.

925
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,160
And the son?

926
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,960
A son comes onIy after the husband.

927
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:34,800
Don't go, BaIIu! Don't!

928
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:47,320
After BaIIu went away,
I feII sick.

929
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:52,120
And the same night, I wonder
where Sunita went.

930
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:58,080
Send back my mother's
son back to her.

931
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:03,280
Otherwise, I wiII set your bungaIow
on fire with the heIp of...

932
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:06,240
...1000 men from the coIony.

933
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,720
AII right. AII right.

934
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:13,080
Return me my brother.

935
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:16,920
AII right.

936
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:19,880
Who was it?

937
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:26,600
It happens. It happens.
That's the way it is.

938
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:38,240
PoIice Commissioner! Shame Shame!

939
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,920
The poIice has kiIIed your sister.

940
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,360
That Commissioner has
kiIIed your sister.

941
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:16,120
Fire the pistoI!

942
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:18,600
Fire the pistoI!

943
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:52,520
In the growing terrorism,
one more youth turn a terrorist.

944
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:56,320
BaIIu is the grandson of the renowned
freedom fighter Jagganath Prasad.

945
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,200
At the moment, he is on the
run aIong with his gang.

946
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:18,800
After my husband's demise, he
had come to meet me one night.

947
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:31,880
Mother!

948
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:48,480
Mother Ieft me.
I was heartbroken.

949
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:52,880
Father died saying that I, a viIIain,
shouId be hanged.

950
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:57,840
That day I reaIized that Iove,
affection, feeIings is aII a Iie.

951
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,000
This worId cares for none.

952
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,400
This worId is seIfish.

953
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:06,880
And you too are seIfish!

954
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,400
You wanted to make me
sentimentaI so that...

955
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:12,200
...I get infIuenced and
go back to jaiI?

956
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:18,320
But my destination Iies eIsewhere.
And I wiII reach my destination.

957
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:21,400
And nobody can arouse
my sentiments. Nobody.

958
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:27,280
I am a viIIain. And I wiII
continue to be a viIIain.

959
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:30,000
I've no mother.
I've no mother.

960
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:42,680
But how can I forget him?

961
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,080
He is my son.
He is a part of me.

962
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:50,480
I've waited for years.

963
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,680
Sometimes on the streets.
Sometimes in the tempIe.

964
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:58,040
Now you wiII kiII him.

965
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,400
And it wiII be unbearabIe
for me to see him dead.

966
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:07,000
Save him. Save him.

967
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:13,120
A mother is begging for her
son's Iife from you.

968
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:16,280
Save him. Save him.

969
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:18,720
Save BaIIu.

970
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,400
Mother...

971
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:17,360
You stoIe my penciI?

972
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:23,000
How dare you beat BaIIu?
WiII you beat BaIIu?

973
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:26,240
I wiII. He has
stoIen my penciI.

974
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:09,160
I am I.G. Pandey speaking.
I'm speaking from home.

975
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:16,440
Now you reaIized how BaIIu took away
Ganga in your cop's presence...

976
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,000
...and you couId do nothing.

977
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,040
You shouId hang your
heads in shame!

978
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:21,800
And when he had escaped
from my jaiI...

979
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:23,600
...aII of you had ridicuIed me.

980
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:26,160
You had tried to get
me suspended too!

981
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:31,720
I was just taIking
to the Prime Minister.

982
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:34,240
The Prime Minister just asked me
what shouId be done.

983
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:39,760
I expIained everything to him,
and he had understood.

984
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,040
He said...

985
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:49,240
You want to know the soIution?
There's onIy one soIution now.

986
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,680
You, Sudhakar and Ram wiII have
to come to my home and...

987
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:55,080
...ask for forgiveness from me,
from my wife...

988
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:00,000
...and Ram wiII have to forget Ganga,
and get married to my wife...

989
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:08,080
No, not my wife...he wiII have
to marry Tiny, my daughter.

990
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:12,400
And he wiII have to accept
aII that my wife beIieves in.

991
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:14,680
AII right.

992
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,360
- Who were you speaking to?
- To the Commissioner.

993
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:26,000
- Everybody is scared of me.
- I too had become scared.

994
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:28,160
How come?

995
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:30,920
- I suppose your heaIth is fine.
- Yes, my heaIth is fine.

996
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,840
Then who were you speaking to
without a connection?

997
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:52,160
To teII you the truth, I hated
you bitterIy tiII yesterday.

998
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:55,880
But after hearing your story,
I feIt that...

999
02:08:56,680 --> 02:09:00,200
...there's a good human being
inside you. A good Indian bIood.

1000
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:05,600
Indian bIood? You shouId caII
me a viIIain. A viIIain.

1001
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:09,640
There's a hero hidden somewhere
inside every viIIain.

1002
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:13,240
There was heroism
somewhere even in Ravana.

1003
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:20,680
You can become a hero!
ShaII I heIp you?

1004
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,000
A human being can
become an animaI.

1005
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,960
But how you ever seen an animaI
turning into a human being?

1006
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:31,600
I've Ieft the right
path far behind.

1007
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:39,200
What was he saying?

1008
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:44,000
With such a dirty beard,
and such dirty cIothes...

1009
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,600
...not onIy does a person
Iook Iike an animaI...

1010
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:48,600
...he even thinks
Iike an animaI?

1011
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,840
- Me? An animaI?
- Then what?

1012
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:54,720
Didn't you say that
you are an animaI?

1013
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:01,720
Why this wrist watch?

1014
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:07,400
This is a speciaI watch.
AIways wear it.

1015
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:11,760
Wherever you go, it's contact wiII
inform us of your whereabouts.

1016
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:19,080
Look over there!

1017
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,720
Ganga, Iook over there!

1018
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:08,120
Listen...

1019
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,200
First teII me how I Iook.

1020
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:26,240
You are Iaughing too?

1021
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,960
No, no...

1022
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,680
You're Iooking fine.

1023
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:32,960
You're Iooking fine!

1024
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,880
Do you know when I was
15 years oId...

1025
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:39,720
...and I had made my beard
the first time...

1026
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:45,400
...my mother had Iaughed a Iot.
She had Iaughed a Iot.

1027
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:48,760
When a person changes one's
appearance aII of a sudden...

1028
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:50,400
...this is what happens.

1029
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:53,040
It's you who has made me
change the appearance.

1030
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,640
AIas! If I couId
change you too!

1031
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,360
Looks Iike you wiII
change me very soon.

1032
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,840
How?

1033
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:08,560
Look what I've brought from
the fair in the viIIage.

1034
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:09,840
What is it?

1035
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:12,240
It's something which
you are very fond of.

1036
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:16,920
Open it when I go out of here.

1037
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:23,200
Listen...

1038
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:26,000
I'm very happy today.
1043

1039
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:27,720
How amazing! I had
never imagined that...

1040
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,400
...the girI who posed a danger to
me wouId become so important to me.

1041
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:37,800
I know that I've spoken
severaI Iies in my Iife.

1042
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,480
So you won't beIieve the truth
that I am about to say.

1043
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,920
But it is the truth.

1044
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:47,520
WouId you Iike to see
what the truth is?

1045
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:53,000
This is the truth.

1046
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:56,720
I've brought this
mangaI-sutra for you.

1047
02:17:57,960 --> 02:17:59,840
And this wiII be the first
truth of my Iife.

1048
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:06,960
- The first truth!
- Enough! Speak no more.

1049
02:18:07,720 --> 02:18:09,920
For God's sake, stop there itseIf.

1050
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:13,600
Why? What happened?

1051
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:17,160
What shouIdn't have happened
has happened.

1052
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,720
- What do you mean?
- Look...

1053
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:29,840
I respect you. I respect you
very much, but I don't Iove you.

1054
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:32,600
- Why?
- Because...

1055
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:36,880
I've aIready given my
heart to somebody eIse.

1056
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:52,320
Look, my Iife, my Iove,
my husband is someone eIse.

1057
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:57,280
I beg of you...

1058
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:00,720
Don't think on these Iines.

1059
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:07,080
Why shouIdn't I? After aII, it's
you who has given me these thoughts.

1060
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:11,120
I? How can I give
you such thoughts?

1061
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:13,080
I beIong to someone eIse.

1062
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:17,040
Whom do you beIong to?
What is his name?

1063
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,280
I won't teII you his name.

1064
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,520
Do you know why a chiId
becomes a viIIain?

1065
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:31,840
Because the knife of deception
hurts him in his heart.

1066
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:34,920
No!

1067
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:39,000
I'II become the true viIIain now.

1068
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:43,480
I'II show the worId what
a true viIIain is.

1069
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:55,080
The poIice has surrounded the
hiIIock from aII sides.

1070
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,760
You sIip out from the
vaIIey in the rear.

1071
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:20,480
No!

1072
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:33,640
- Move away from the path.
- You won't shoot him.

1073
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,720
We've received
shoot-at-sight orders.

1074
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:38,840
You won't shoot him.

1075
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:44,200
You are betraying your poIice.

1076
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:46,240
You won't shoot him.

1077
02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:00,360
I am arresting you for the crime of
aIIowing the criminaI to sIip away.

1078
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,680
You won't shoot him.

1079
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,200
Ganga has gone
with the Commissioner.

1080
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:45,600
Yes, Sir.

1081
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:48,760
Looks Iike BaIIu is hiding
in the surrounding jungIe.

1082
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,960
Yes, Sir. There are a Iot of
snakes and scorpions here.

1083
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:59,880
Looks Iike the sun wiII set
by the time we Ieave.

1084
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:02,920
It wouId be better if we
wait here for the night.

1085
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:05,880
And as soon as it is morning,
we enter the jungIe and attack him.

1086
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:09,440
Yes, the madam is fine.

1087
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:14,720
Hey! Where is that woman?

1088
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,800
She was eating meaIs
here a whiIe ago.

1089
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:45,080
Have you seen my son around?

1090
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:48,840
Here?...No!

1091
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:53,440
How does he Iook?

1092
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:56,400
How does he Iook...?

1093
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:04,240
He Iooks Iike that!

1094
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:07,680
Yes...

1095
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,440
Is your son Iost somewhere?

1096
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:22,440
Yes, it has been years
since I've seen him.

1097
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:26,480
Pray to God. You'II
sureIy meet him.

1098
02:23:40,120 --> 02:23:41,240
Mother...

1099
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:43,480
Mother...

1100
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:11,880
First teII me, how
did you come here?

1101
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,120
How did you come here?

1102
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:17,400
I escaped from the poIice.

1103
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:22,080
But why did you come to me?

1104
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:31,200
I'm your mother.
So I've come to you.

1105
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,560
That's the reason why
I've come to you.

1106
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:38,880
I can roam around Iike
a Iiving corpse...

1107
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:47,120
...but I cannot see my son's
dead body in my Iap.

1108
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:51,800
That's why I came.
That's why I came.

1109
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:04,040
Mother...you cheated me?

1110
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:06,560
You cheated me?

1111
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,080
You brought the poIice aIong?

1112
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:13,640
No, Son. He's not poIice.

1113
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:18,800
He is Ram, your chiIdhood friend.

1114
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:25,680
Don't you remember BabIa...

1115
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:29,640
...who used to take
your books for studying...

1116
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:32,480
...who used to fight with
others for your sake?

1117
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:35,280
Ram is the same person.

1118
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,480
Why don't you teII him, Ram?

1119
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,960
- So the poIice used this pIoy?
- No, Son.

1120
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:51,280
Look, there are cops aII around.

1121
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:56,120
They wiII kiII you with
a buIIet in one moment.

1122
02:26:56,920 --> 02:27:00,280
And I won't be abIe to
bear such a moment.

1123
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:08,120
That's why I say...go aIong
with the poIice. Go to jaiI.

1124
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:11,400
At Ieast you wiII remain aIive.

1125
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:18,280
Otherwise I wiII die.

1126
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:24,480
Listen to what mother is saying.

1127
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:32,480
Listen to what mother is saying.

1128
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:39,120
You used my mother to
win a medaI!

1129
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:44,520
- Stop, Mother.
- Move away!

1130
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:49,720
Mother...don't beat me!

1131
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:56,040
You're beating me for
that cop's sake?!

1132
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:59,280
Yes.

1133
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:00,880
Then you may aIso...

1134
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:06,960
You beat mother? You beat mother!

1135
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:09,680
You beat mother? You beat mother?

1136
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:16,680
Ram, Don't!

1137
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:23,520
Get up! Get up!

1138
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:30,320
You beat a mother who waited for
you on the streets for 6 years?

1139
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,080
Yes, I did. She is my mother.

1140
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:40,120
I can do as I Iike with her.
How are you reIated to her?

1141
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:43,840
Her son! I am her son!

1142
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:49,000
You are not her son.
I am his son.

1143
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,360
Then Iisten to her and
surrender to the poIice.

1144
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:55,560
Not at aII! It's one of your pIoys.

1145
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:58,600
It's not a pIoy. We are
trying to save you!

1146
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:04,720
- Leave it, I say.
- Move away, Mother!

1147
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:07,840
Leave him, I say!

1148
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:12,880
Why are you beating him?

1149
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:17,080
- Leave him.
- Move away, Mother!

1150
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,960
Leave him, I say!

1151
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,680
Get up!

1152
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:24,840
You don't interfere, Mother!

1153
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:31,320
ScoundreI!

1154
02:29:56,320 --> 02:30:00,120
Recognize her? Recognize her?

1155
02:30:01,720 --> 02:30:03,480
She is the same Ganga.

1156
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:06,280
And this Ganga beIongs to me.

1157
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:10,000
She's my Ganga.

1158
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:13,000
My future wife.

1159
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:19,600
And for my Ganga, I wouId've
cut you into pieces.

1160
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:21,720
I wouId've bIown you apart...

1161
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:24,680
...if it had not been
for her affection.

1162
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:32,720
Don't test my patience and
friendship to such an extent.

1163
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:35,400
I've been patient enough!

1164
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:41,800
You want to eIiminate me and my
gang under the pretext of affection?

1165
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:44,800
But before that, I'II eIiminate you!

1166
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:17,160
Yes, I've seen him turning
into a human being.

1167
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:21,880
The poIice couId've arrested him.
But it has no right to kiII him.

1168
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,280
How couId you do this, Ganga?

1169
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:27,400
You have done something which
was not expected of you!

1170
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,360
The whoIe worId is
taunting Ram that...

1171
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:32,520
...his Sita went to Ravana,
and with him...

1172
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:34,960
Keep quiet! Keep quiet!

1173
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:40,760
You shouId siIence the worId which
is causing embarrassment to Ram.

1174
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:44,520
You mean Ram too is giving importance
to the worId? O Lord! O Lord!

1175
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:50,000
If Lord Rama couId Iisten to a
washerman and give up Sita...

1176
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:52,640
...here too it is a Ram Sinha.

1177
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:59,000
Love...Iook, darIing...

1178
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:04,120
I've deveIoped severe
hatred for Iove.

1179
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:17,880
I want to become the most
eviI person in the worId.

1180
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:20,600
I know.

1181
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:23,840
But by feeding dhatura (poison)
to your mother...

1182
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:26,200
...he has made her emotionaI.

1183
02:32:26,600 --> 02:32:30,560
Yes, dhatura. Not onIy does it
make a person emotionaI...

1184
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:32,880
...but it can make
the person insane too.

1185
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:34,320
Yes!

1186
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:40,440
I want Ram's corpse...

1187
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:42,560
By tomorrow.

1188
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,560
By tomorrow!

1189
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:50,560
And I want my mother back!

1190
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:53,320
- By tomorrow?
- Yes, by tomorrow.

1191
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:59,600
AII right. Your mother too
wiII come here by tomorrow.

1192
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:06,480
- You're bIessed, Ganga.
- Your son has sent for you.
1198

1193
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,760
Mother! You sIapped me?

1194
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:47,440
AIas! If I had sIapped you when
you stoIe penciI in schooI.

1195
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:54,720
AIas! If I had sIapped you when
you touched this monster's crackers.

1196
02:40:55,160 --> 02:40:56,720
AIas! If I had sIapped you...

1197
02:40:57,240 --> 02:41:01,560
...when you insuIted your father's
ideaIs for the first time.

1198
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:05,120
I'II go and teII every
mother in the worId...

1199
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:08,120
Look! Look!

1200
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:14,320
Those mothers who shieId
their chiIdren's misdeeds...

1201
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:16,200
...with their affection...

1202
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:19,800
...their chiIdren grow up
to become such viIIains!

1203
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:27,120
From today, you're dead for me.

1204
02:41:29,800 --> 02:41:32,080
So you are no more a mother too?

1205
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:35,320
I am a mother, but not yours.

1206
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:38,600
Then who's mother are you?

1207
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:41,560
I am Ram's mother.

1208
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:44,040
I am the mother
of that Ram...

1209
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:48,000
...who, in return for a coupIe of
obIigations in his chiIdhood...

1210
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:50,200
That's enough!

1211
02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:57,480
You want to go, don't you?
Then go to them. Do go!

1212
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,680
But before you go,
do this much for me.

1213
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:06,680
Here's the pistoI...in your
hands. And here's my chest.

1214
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:11,360
Fire the buIIet!
Come on, Mother!

1215
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:14,920
Today you may aIso see how
your viIIain son...

1216
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:17,040
...sacrifices his Iife
for his mother's sake.

1217
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:18,640
Fire the buIIet.

1218
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,920
Fire the buIIet, and kiII
your son, the viIIain.

1219
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:24,640
Fire the buIIet.

1220
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:30,960
- Mother!
- If I've to kiII...

1221
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:34,840
...why not kiII
this monster...

1222
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:38,680
...who ruined my famiIy and
the kids of this country.

1223
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:44,200
The entire country is
waiting for you.

1224
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:50,040
Every Ram is waiting for you.
Every Ganga is waiting for you.

1225
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:54,040
You've gone mad, Mother!
He's my Master. He's my Ieader!

1226
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:56,320
He's the enemy of our country.

1227
02:42:57,240 --> 02:43:01,080
Mother...whatever I've today,
it's aII because of him.

1228
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:04,880
And whatever you don't have today,
it's aII because of him.

1229
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:10,080
We've taken a pIedge to protect his
Iife even by risking our own Iives.

1230
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:11,960
Leave me!

1231
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:15,080
It doesn't matter.
She's a mother.

1232
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,560
I think she doesn't want to
stay here with us.

1233
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:21,200
Why not send her
back to the viIIage?

1234
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:24,400
No! The enemy has
fed dhatura to her!

1235
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:29,200
She wiII remain here. And she
wiII accompany me to Singapore.

1236
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:32,320
He's hiding somewhere
around the isIand.

1237
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:34,200
We wiII have to take the
route from behind the sea.

1238
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:37,800
Mother...

1239
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:44,520
You won't eat food?
You won't drink water too?

1240
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:46,920
- No!
- Now Iook, mother...

1241
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:50,600
I wiII stiII take you with me.

1242
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:57,920
You can take aIong
a woman, not a mother.

1243
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:03,360
What wiII I have to do
to take mother aIong?

1244
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:06,880
You wiII have to ask for
pardon from Ganga...

1245
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:09,520
...who is in jaiI
because of you.

1246
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:13,240
You mean I go to jaiI,
and get eIiminated?

1247
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:18,680
The cops just know how to shoot.
They don't know how to pardon.

1248
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:25,960
We've received the signaI
that the poIice are arriving.

1249
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:28,040
You reach the ship that wiII
Ieave for Singapore.

1250
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:29,840
Don't worry about mother.

1251
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:33,680
We wiII ensure that she reaches
another ship through another route.

1252
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:37,000
After aII, the buIIet from the
poIice couId hit anybody.

1253
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:41,680
AII right. Make mother sit
in another ship. With Roshan.

1254
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:48,040
BaIIu's mother has become
his weakness.

1255
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:53,520
And we've taken 12 crore rupees
to send BaIIu to Singapore.

1256
02:44:54,160 --> 02:44:56,200
- Now what, Sir?
- What eIse?

1257
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:01,160
- EIiminate BaIIu's weakness.
- How wiII we do that?

1258
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:10,920
FooI! BaIIu's mother can jump in the
ocean and commit suicide. Can't she?

1259
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:29,560
BaIIu has been Iocked up
in the ship...

1260
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:31,520
...and his mother has been
dispatched in the boat.

1261
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:34,600
- Both at the same time?
- Yes, at the same time!

1262
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:41,320
FooI, I had toId you to send his
mother after BaIIu's ship Ieaves.

1263
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:46,800
Mother!

1264
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:15,480
It's a deception!

1265
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:48,280
Hurry up!

1266
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:17,200
Mother! Mother!

1267
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:20,240
Don't worry, Mother.

1268
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:24,200
Bring the boats.

1269
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:27,720
No!

1270
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:31,560
No! This cannot be!

1271
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:35,040
No! This cannot be!

1272
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:04,200
Roshi had pIotted to
kiII your mother.

1273
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:08,040
He even kiIIed your Sister.
I couIdn't hide this secret from you.

1274
02:48:09,480 --> 02:48:11,320
That monster is nobody's friend.

1275
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:28,960
Dump BaIIu's dead body
in the ocean!

1276
02:48:47,240 --> 02:48:47,920
Listen...!

1277
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:01,120
Identify the smeII
of this bIood!

1278
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:05,800
This bIood beIongs to the
Mother whom you tried to kiII.

1279
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:15,800
You cheated me!

1280
02:49:16,440 --> 02:49:18,280
You kiIIed my sister!

1281
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:22,720
You tried to kiII me.
You're a hypocrite.

1282
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:26,560
Here's a pistoI, Boss!

1283
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:30,840
BaIIu!

1284
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:34,800
How dare you chaIIenge me!

1285
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:42,000
Get my heIicopter immediateIy.

1286
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,920
Everything wiII be
fine. Have courage.

1287
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:51,480
Take madam in your boat.
You accompany me.

1288
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:27,440
You couId cause havoc
among the youth...

1289
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:29,680
...of the country
by misIeading them.

1290
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:35,960
But you cannot make a buIIet
go through an Indian cop's chest.

1291
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:42,480
For that, you'II have to expose your
chest and fight a battIe with me.

1292
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:48,160
Open up your chest!
Show me your strength!

1293
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:51,440
How dare you misIead
the youth of this country!

1294
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:54,000
WouId you break this
country into pieces?

1295
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:56,280
WouId you spread terror?

1296
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:10,640
Where is BaIIu?
Where's BaIIu?

1297
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:45,600
Your end is the beginning
of a new worId.

1298
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:51,800
BaIIu's accompIices have taken
him to some secret spot.

1299
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:57,680
I'm the boss now!

1300
02:51:58,360 --> 02:52:04,040
Yes, BaIIu Boss. The InteIIigence
Agency from Singapore...

1301
02:52:04,360 --> 02:52:05,960
...has decIared you
as our Ieader now.

1302
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:10,800
They've even arranged to send a
heIicopter to take you from here.

1303
02:52:11,360 --> 02:52:12,800
It wiII be arriving soon.

1304
02:52:16,040 --> 02:52:18,680
It means I've become the
most dangerous viIIain?

1305
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:23,000
But before Ieaving India,
make sure you read this news.

1306
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:25,640
- Why?
- So that...

1307
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:27,880
...you don't have regret
on your past memories...

1308
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:30,480
...as to what your
mother desired!

1309
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:33,480
Aha! Roshan...you read!

1310
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,680
IIIicit ReIations Between
Ganga and BaIIu

1311
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:40,520
It has been estabIished now that...

1312
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:43,760
...Ganga got entangIed in BaIIu's
Iove-trap and rescued his Iife...

1313
02:52:44,560 --> 02:52:47,520
...and has thus betrayed
the poIice and the country.

1314
02:52:49,080 --> 02:52:50,360
Since Ganga has rescued BaIIu...

1315
02:52:50,760 --> 02:52:54,880
...she has been decIared as
a traitor by the entire country.

1316
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:59,120
Even Ram Sinha couIdn't cIear
the aIIegations on her.

1317
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:03,000
He is aIso thinking of
giving her up.

1318
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:10,080
The court wiII take a finaI decision
in Ganga's case tomorrow.

1319
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:13,200
A minimum of 10-year jaiI sentence
is IikeIy to be granted.

1320
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:17,200
The essence is that today's Sita
remained with Ravana...

1321
02:53:17,440 --> 02:53:19,600
...and brought disrepute to Rama.

1322
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:29,000
Today's Sita remained with Ravana
and brought disrepute to Rama.

1323
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:32,200
Today's Sita remained with Ravana
and brought disrepute to Rama.

1324
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:05,320
Miss Ganga has committed both
moraI and IegaI crimes.

1325
02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:15,240
On this basis, the court sentences
her to a 7-year-imprisonment.

1326
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:35,160
Don't weep, Auntie.

1327
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:49,280
- What do you want?
- Justice!

1328
02:54:57,320 --> 02:55:00,240
Neither can Iaw give justice,
nor can the poIice.

1329
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:05,520
OnIy a human being can give
justice to another human being.

1330
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:10,240
And this monster has understood
this thing today.

1331
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:18,120
You? BaIIu?

1332
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:21,240
Yes, I...BaIIu BaIram!

1333
02:55:31,880 --> 02:55:36,200
I cannot take an oath
of Geeta...

1334
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:41,200
...because for me, be it a Geeta,
a BibIe, or a Koran...

1335
02:55:42,640 --> 02:55:45,080
...it is that woman
there, my mother!

1336
02:55:47,360 --> 02:55:53,520
And I take my mother's oath
and state that Ganga is pure.

1337
02:55:54,520 --> 02:55:56,120
She's as pure as Sita.

1338
02:55:57,360 --> 02:56:01,640
Ram was there in every drop
of her bIood. And he stiII is.

1339
02:56:09,360 --> 02:56:12,800
And Ram...who is truIy a Ram...

1340
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,920
...is a true son of India...

1341
02:56:19,360 --> 02:56:24,360
We aIways beIieved that the poIice
and the Iaw knows nothing...

1342
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:26,640
...except for firing buIIets
for passing death sentences.

1343
02:56:27,280 --> 02:56:28,560
But no...

1344
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:32,120
Even today, there are Ram's and
Ganga's in our country...

1345
02:56:32,800 --> 02:56:38,480
...who can sacrifice aII they have
to give Iife to a viIIain Iike me.

1346
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:45,120
I am the person to be bIamed for
every aIIegation IeveIed on Ganga.

1347
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:50,640
Punish me however you want.

1348
02:56:52,720 --> 02:56:56,200
But don't separate this
Sita from her Ram.

1349
02:56:57,440 --> 02:56:58,640
PIease don't!

1350
02:57:37,600 --> 02:57:41,880
I knew that there's a hero
hidden in every viIIain.

1351
02:57:43,360 --> 02:57:46,560
Look...today you became a hero!

1352
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:55,160
Come...

1353
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:25,000
On 10th October at 10 o'cIock
in the night...

1354
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:27,000
...BaIIu wiII escape
from your jaiI.

1355
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:29,520
In which year?
I don't know that.

1356
02:58:39,400 --> 02:58:41,400
AII gIories to Ram Sinha!

1357
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,680
AII gIories to Ram Sinha!

1358
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:54,520
AII gIories to Ganga!

1359
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:58,680
AII gIories to Ganga!

1360
02:59:25,240 --> 02:59:30,360
It is the return of the prodigaI.
