2
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:45,521
- The groom's here.
- Really? Let's go and see him.

3
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:07,629
Madhu, take this.
A gift for you.

4
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:12,640
Your love letters. Just returning
the memories of the days gone by.

5
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:17,682
Because out of jealousy, this hurt
mind may not do something bad.

6
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:23,284
I've no right over you from today.
You belong to somebody else now.

7
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:30,446
But when you go around the
holy fire, with your husband...

8
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,073
...think this to be a funeral
pyre of my love. Yours, Kailash.

9
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,207
No, Kailash. No!

10
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:43,612
Why not? I haven't
wetted my throat as yet.

11
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:49,765
- Want to drown your sorrow?
- Sorrow? What sorrow?

12
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,947
Your Madhavi is marrying
somebody else today, isn't she?

13
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:02,745
I've enjoyed and sent packing
countless such girls in my life.

14
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:10,388
I regret just one thing. I lost
access to her uncle's wealth.

15
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:15,289
So you wish to burn this ache
with the fiery embers of liquor?

16
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:23,742
The fire that I ignite...
I know how to douse it too.

17
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:28,069
Let me go.
What are you doing?

18
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:42,727
Who can it be so late
in the night?

19
00:02:56,994 --> 00:03:01,333
- I'm back, Kailash.
- But, you were to wed today!

20
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:07,272
Yes, but I threw all the social
norms to the wind, and ran away.

21
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:13,956
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't... your love did it.

22
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:20,221
Your letter gave me such confidence
that before entering the pandal...

23
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,976
...I came to you.
Burning my boats!

24
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:26,923
You shouldn't have done that.

25
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:33,811
Your uncle will never forgive you
for this blunder you've committed.

26
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:38,821
You've done this impulsively.
Better leave me alone and go back.

27
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,899
This will be better for us.
- Please don't say that.

28
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:49,186
I'll be better off here,
loving you all my life.

29
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,435
Love and wealth have their own
places. Both are essential in life.

30
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:59,345
- You're saying funny
things today. - I was just...

31
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:04,550
I mean if you run away like this,
your uncle will disown you!

32
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:10,461
I love you, that's why
I can never bear...

33
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:16,698
...any injustice done to you.
Had your uncle given his consent...

34
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:22,435
...his wealth would've
helped us in our new life.

35
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:36,823
So this is the real you!
Betrayer!

36
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,515
Fraud! Gold digger!

37
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:45,688
Under the pretext of love,
you've been cheating on me!

38
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:50,700
Why weren't you unmasked just
one day before? Don't touch me!

39
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:56,194
Don't even take my name!
I hate you!

40
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:58,488
I hate you, I say!

41
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:40,286
She might as well commit suicide!
She has brought shame...

42
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:45,122
- ...to the uncle who reared her!
- She looked so naive!

43
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:48,816
But see what she did.

44
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:53,473
Her uncle will have to hide
his face in his old age now!

45
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:04,720
Forgive me, uncle.

46
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:09,591
I've reduced the respect
you commanded, to dust.

47
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:15,431
The mistake that I've committed,
is not a mere error, it's a sin!

48
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,827
You better throttle this
niece of yours now!

49
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,836
Death is the only way
to make up for my sin!

50
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:33,090
Why don't you say something, uncle?
Say something! Answer me!

51
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:41,888
No!

52
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:01,613
If I'm not mistaken, aren't
you Madhavi, niece of Baburam?

53
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:06,587
You jilted your groom!
Want to try a hand at others?

54
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:38,742
Hey! Madhu?
Recognize me?

55
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,503
- I have seen you after long.
- Where are you going? Your...

56
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,336
What...?

57
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:58,980
No!

58
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:04,405
- No, Poonam. This can't...
- It's true. It's 6 months now.

59
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:06,978
In a jeep accident.

60
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,265
How cruel God is!

61
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:17,171
Those who need mercy,
He does injustice to them!

62
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:22,874
- Where are you going?
- Nainital.

63
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,218
My in-laws live there.
I'm going for the first time.

64
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,079
To your in-laws for
the first time?

65
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,123
Yes.

66
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,520
We had married against his father's
wishes. I wouldn't have gone now.

67
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,548
But I'm going
only for his sake.

68
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:50,132
You didn't tell me anything about
yourself. I heard you were to marry.

69
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:55,696
- I was to marry, but
I didn't. - Why not?

70
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,527
It's a long story.

71
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:05,086
Okay. Now tell me,
where are you going?

72
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:11,590
What does a leaf in a storm
know of its destination?

73
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,519
I can't leave you alone
without a shelter like this.

74
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:21,356
- Come to my in-laws with me.
- No. What will they say?

75
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,468
Nothing. I'll tell them
you're my sister.

76
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,570
I've no other blood relation anyway.
So I brought you along.

77
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:33,809
- Suppose they find out the truth?
- We're not lying, my dear.

78
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,239
You're my childhood friend.
And they've never seen me.

79
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:42,990
They're strangers to me,
and I'm unknown to them!

80
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:49,317
We'll share our joys and sorrows
and spend our life, rearing him.

81
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:54,000
- Your train's coming.
- All right.

82
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,903
You'll have to come!
Let's go.

83
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:14,920
- What are you thinking about?
- Had you not helped me...

84
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,571
...what would I have done?

85
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:22,529
Forget all that now. Come.
I'll show you some photographs.

86
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:33,831
This is my son's birthday photo
and these are our wedding ones.

87
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,807
How handsome your husband was!
What was his name?

88
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,606
Shekhar.

89
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:46,663
Now I live only on his memory.
These are his letters.

90
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:51,983
Which make me feel as
though he's always near me.

91
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:56,923
And this letter is from my
father-in-law. He's written...

92
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,932
God has snatched
our son from us...

93
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:08,088
...only to punish us for our error.
But now, I'll just say this.

94
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:14,930
You have our family's heir.
If you can, forgive us, your in-laws..

95
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:21,021
 ... and come with him to us.
Our house will always await you.

96
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,614
Sounds as though he has penned
this with a grieving heart.

97
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:29,722
Good that you decided
to go and meet them.

98
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:16,175
This is an emergency hospital.
Your train had an accident.

99
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:22,431
- Where's Poonam?
- We don't know anybody's name.

100
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,870
- When you get well, see for
yourself. - I'm perfectly well.

101
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:01,929
- Who are you?
- Her sister.

102
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,391
Good thing you're here.

103
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:07,979
She's very critical.
She tried to swallow poison.

104
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:10,758
- I've sedated her now.
- Come, doctor.

105
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:14,100
Look, we're short of staff.
You better sit with her.

106
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:22,945
Kill me.
Please let me die.

107
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,421
No, Poonam.

108
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:31,984
- Who is it?
- It's me, Madhu.

109
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,172
Your friend.

110
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,971
My son...?

111
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:41,449
He's sleeping.
Look over there.

112
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,400
My darling!

113
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:54,865
Madhu... Come closer.

114
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:00,629
- I am right here. Yes?
- I'm going now.

115
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,362
No, don't say that.

116
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,632
Promise me, Madhu.

117
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,646
That you'll take care of
him and bring him up.

118
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:18,514
- We'll both bring
him up together. - No.

119
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,855
He's yours now, and
you're his mother.

120
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:28,698
No, dear friend.
You'll be well soon.

121
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:34,439
No! No!
My legs are amputated.

122
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:40,105
Yes!
My in-laws...

123
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:44,658
...they'll never give an invalid
the status of a daughter-in-law.

124
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,429
You go there in my place.

125
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:57,045
No! It's not possible.
I can never do this.

126
00:15:57,534 --> 00:16:03,615
Will you leave him as an orphan?
Won't you bring him up?

127
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:09,699
- It's not that, but I...
- Promise me, Madhu.

128
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:15,819
Promise that you'll live
there like his mother.

129
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:17,969
- No!
- Promise me.

130
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,993
I won't die
peacefully otherwise.

131
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,495
Promise me...

132
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,221
Please come.

133
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:51,167
Very sorry about your sister.
What's your name?

134
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:55,655
And your son's?

135
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:59,515
Where will you go now?
Your address?

136
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:28,171
How much more do we travel?
- About an hour or two, madam.

137
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:32,446
An hour or two?
Stop at some hotel en route.

138
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,712
- We need some milk.
- Right, Ma'am.

139
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:52,577
Give it to me.

140
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:16,370
- Where are you taking us?
- We'll reach earlier this way.

141
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:21,519
- Before evening, in fact.
- This is a jungle! Turn back.

142
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,822
Turn back, I said!

143
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,714
Turn back!
Can't you hear?

144
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:34,838
- Get aside!
- Stop the car!

145
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,234
- Else, I'll jump off!
- Really? With this kid?

146
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:49,505
- Give me all the
money you have! - Help!

147
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:59,376
Help!

148
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,462
- Your purse.
- Thank you.

149
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:39,761
- If you hadn't...
- Mention not.

150
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:42,961
You can't go in this taxi, but
I could drop you in my jeep.

151
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,569
- Where do you want to go?
- Nainital?

152
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:51,927
- This road goes to Almora.
- The driver took the wrong road.

153
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:57,417
You shouldn't go alone in this weather.
Going further is impossible.

154
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:02,493
The mountain streams overflow,
and the road is closed at night.

155
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:06,605
What! Then, how...
how will I...?

156
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:11,016
Don't panic. I'm a forest officer.
And my house is near by.

157
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:16,612
If you trust me, spend the night
in my house. I'll take you tomorrow.

158
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:41,111
- Has Munna slept?
- Yes.

159
00:22:46,294 --> 00:22:50,076
- You're fond of poetry too?
- Pardon?

160
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,949
Yes, a long time ago. I not only
read them, but wrote them too.

161
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,427
The last one was a song.
But that too remained unfinished.

162
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,766
Neither is there any emotion...
Nor there is any desire.

163
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:06,978
My life is nothing but
a felled, drifting kite!

164
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:09,848
Beautiful!

165
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,927
But when I realized,
life's harsh reality...

166
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,581
...it ended the delicate
inspiration of poetry. And now...

167
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:23,456
...now I like these dense forests,
perilous atmosphere and wild animals.

168
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,714
Anyway, forget it.
I want to ask you something.

169
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:31,864
Go ahead.

170
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:37,888
Ever since I've met you, I feel
as though I've seen you somewhere.

171
00:23:40,745 --> 00:23:45,605
Sometimes, after seeing a person,
he seems an old acquaintance.

172
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,707
What did you say your name was?
Where do you stay in Nainital?

173
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:55,125
I don't stay there. I'm going for
the first time. To my in-laws.

174
00:23:55,662 --> 00:23:59,466
The in-laws live there, and going for
the first time? I don't quite follow.

175
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:05,280
My husband married me against
their wishes. That's why.

176
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,345
I see. May I ask you
who they are?

177
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:13,554
The retired collector there
is my father-in-law.

178
00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:18,605
The owner of "Lake View"?
You're Shekhar's wife?

179
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:22,841
- But that train accident...
- She survived it!

180
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:29,446
- Ironic, isn't it?
- It's wonderful!

181
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:34,418
- How do you know my in-laws?
- It's my second home.

182
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,619
My father and he
are like brothers.

183
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:41,619
In childhood, Shekhar and I
played and studied together.

184
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:47,258
But we parted ways when we grew up.
Then I went to Germany.

185
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:51,215
When I returned, I heard
that Shekhar had married.

186
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:56,187
And then... that accident.
Life is so quaint!

187
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,708
Today I'm seeing my friend's
wife for the first time.

188
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,463
That too, as a widow!

189
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:13,890
Such a close relation. No wonder
I felt that I had seen you before.

190
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,576
What are you thinking?

191
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:23,277
What will my in-laws say
and think when they see me?

192
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:29,961
What else, except absolute joy
when they see their heir with you?

193
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:34,924
And then, you're their only
support in their old age.

194
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:41,017
- Shall I serve the food, master?
- Oh yes. She must be hungry.

195
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:47,553
Listen. She's not just my guest, but
the daughter-in-law of Diwanji too.

196
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,515
Neither she nor Diwanji should
get a chance to complain.

197
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,538
But of course!
I'll be only too pleased.

198
00:25:56,217 --> 00:26:00,734
It's impossible to go in this rain.
So I'll escort you in the morning.

199
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,758
- See you in the morning.
- Are you going somewhere?

200
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:11,722
Can't help it. There's a
party on. I'll have to go.

201
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:15,922
If I'm late in returning,
don't worry. Feel at home.

202
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,112
- Did you keep the crate
in the car? - Yes, I did.

203
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,370
Listen.

204
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:32,482
I don't ask where and why you go.
But it's a stormy night.

205
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:36,099
You also have a guest.
Will it matter if you don't go?

206
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:40,865
You've been sent here to work.

207
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:45,482
So don't meddle in my affairs.
Go and do your chores.

208
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:50,846
Go and work he says! I reared
him, and now he bosses me!

209
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,318
Come, my dear.
Have your dinner.

210
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,569
Come.

211
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:11,699
Does your master
go out every night?

212
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:14,763
I try and convince him,
but he doesn't heed me.

213
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:19,287
He's busy the whole day and
gets restless towards the evening.

214
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:23,313
He goes to the club or
wanders in the jungles too.

215
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,450
And tries to drown
his sorrow in drinks.

216
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,676
Does he booze too?

217
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:33,753
He never touched it before.
Even when he was abroad.

218
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,083
- But now...
- What happened?

219
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,047
You could say nothing,
or everything too!

220
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:45,258
Sincerity brought him betrayal!
Ever since, he's a broken man.

221
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,028
Who betrayed him?

222
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:50,369
- A girl!
- A girl!

223
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,569
Yes. Why keep it from you?

224
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:59,486
His father had chosen a girl.
He agreed without seeing the girl.

225
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:02,752
- Then?
- Then something queer happened.

226
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:07,965
When they went to the girl's
house, she had run away.

227
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:13,319
What... are you saying?

228
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:18,812
That girl must be a devil to
have ditched such a gentleman!

229
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:21,736
- Where was the wedding?
- In Gangapur.

230
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:42,589
<i>Love...</i>

231
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:46,895
<i>is meant for those...</i>

232
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:55,579
<i>who, with the beloved's
name on their lips...</i>

233
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:01,160
<i>will die, will
be destroyed...</i>

234
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:06,441
<i>and get a bad name
for themselves.</i>

235
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:11,387
<i>Forget it, friends...</i>

236
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,998
<i>I won't ever
fall in love.</i>

237
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:47,277
<i>A lost drink one can
always retrieve...</i>

238
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:51,512
<i>but may no one ever
play with someone's heart.</i>

239
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:09,950
<i>Should one be heart-broken...
the things that can happen.</i>

240
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:12,139
<i>Love...</i>

241
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,483
<i>is meant for those...</i>

242
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:25,829
<i>who, with the beloved's
name on their lips...</i>

243
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:31,838
<i>die, destroy themselves...</i>

244
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,687
<i>and get a bad name.</i>

245
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:44,193
<i>Never mind, forget it...
I'll never fall in love.</i>

246
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:12,501
<i>I'm afraid I might be hooked
when I look into their eyes.</i>

247
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:16,804
<i>The lanes of the beautiful
girls, I walk by...</i>

248
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:34,721
<i>with a distant salute.</i>

249
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,537
<i>Love...</i>

250
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,978
<i>is meant for those...</i>

251
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:51,044
<i>who, with the beloved's
name on their lips...</i>

252
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:56,494
<i>will die, will
be destroyed...</i>

253
00:31:57,336 --> 00:32:01,563
<i>and earn ill-fame.</i>

254
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:09,653
<i>Forget it, friends...
I'll never ever fall in love.</i>

255
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:18,438
<i>Never mind...
I'll never fall in love.</i>

256
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,396
- You're early, aren't you?
- I know I'm late.

257
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:36,800
Tell Poonam I'll
take her now.

258
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:39,026
- She has gone!
- Gone?

259
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:43,720
Then? What she must think!

260
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:46,642
- But how and where did she go?
- Home, where else?

261
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,437
I tried to stop her, but she...
Eventually I put her in a truck.

262
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,197
That's very bad.
You should have gone with her!

263
00:32:55,268 --> 00:33:00,234
- She stopped me! She left this.
- A letter? You may go.

264
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:10,563
I'll never forget the trouble
you went through because of me.

265
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:15,427
Your last poem is the
story of my life.

266
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:18,492
There's no hope,
no emotion within...

267
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,898
My life is like a
felled drifting kite.

268
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,659
- This is Diwanji's mansion.
- Thank you very much.

269
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:56,047
Where the hell is everybody?
Anybody there?

270
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,879
- What's the matter, sir?
- Is this breakfast? Without salt?

271
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:06,508
- The doctor said it was harmful.
- Then go and feed him this!

272
00:34:16,897 --> 00:34:18,427
Who's there?

273
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:26,160
What the...
Who are you?

274
00:34:26,687 --> 00:34:31,997
I'm Poonam.
Your daughter-in-law.

275
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:38,378
- What! - And here's
the letter you wrote.

276
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:47,761
Daughter-in-law...
You're Shekhar's wife?

277
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,481
And this is your treasure.
His heir.

278
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:59,573
My son's son?
Am I dreaming, my dear?

279
00:35:00,522 --> 00:35:02,430
- You're telling the truth?
- Yes, father.

280
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:08,262
That train accident...
You survived it!

281
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:13,267
Yes. I survived to
take care of you...

282
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:17,685
...and to hand over the
heir to your lineage.

283
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:26,830
My darling!
My grandson...

284
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:32,385
Look who's here!
Our daughter-in-law. Our grandson!

285
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:37,172
Go and call your mistress...
My darling grandson.

286
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,890
What is it?

287
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:44,721
Come downstairs. Your son's
wife, her son are here.

288
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,308
My son's wife? Her son?
What are you talking about?

289
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:54,141
Come downstairs and see how lovely
your son's wife and the baby are!

290
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,811
Come.

291
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:04,568
Look, my dear, our son's wife,
our dear grandson are here.

292
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:09,167
My daughter-in-law!

293
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:12,715
- Mother!
- My grandson!

294
00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:20,081
You're my son's wife!
My daughter-in-law.

295
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:26,127
My grandson!

296
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:34,236
See? How strange
are the ways of God.

297
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:39,341
Sometimes He takes away everything,
and at times, He gives so much!

298
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:44,174
We made a great mistake in
rejecting a daughter-in-law like you.

299
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:49,980
Today we've atoned for our sins.
You came, so did our grandson.

300
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:53,871
Our gloomy house is bright
with light once again.

301
00:36:57,491 --> 00:36:58,699
May I come in?

302
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:01,267
Come in.

303
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:06,564
Bless you. You've come
at the right moment.

304
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:10,452
Look who's here.
Shekhar's wife and son.

305
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,975
- I've met them before.
- How come?

306
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,384
Her taxi-driver was wanting
to rob her of her money.

307
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:24,223
I happened to reach in time, and
that rascal ran away. Last night...

308
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,524
... due to the storm,
I took them home.

309
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,304
Bless you.

310
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:34,305
It's due to his goodness
that I'm now here before you.

311
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:38,893
Come. You must be tired.
Rest a while.

312
00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:45,394
Don't go, Kamal. Give him tea,
and then bring the case upstairs.

313
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,304
- Okay, ma'am.
- Come, my dear.

314
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,196
You've come after days, son.

315
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:53,704
- Let's play chess.
- Will do, uncle.

316
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:01,566
This is Shekhar's room.

317
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:07,512
Ever since he left, everything
here has been as it was.

318
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:12,727
As if he were
about to return.

319
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:18,421
But it's all an illusion.
False hopes.

320
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:28,790
Give it to me.
I'll keep it in the cupboard.

321
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:32,893
If you see it, it'll only
make you unhappy.

322
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:38,726
No! He left me
and went away...

323
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:44,289
...now if I can't see his photograph,
it'll be difficult to pull on.

324
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:51,385
True. We have but past memories
to go on living now.

325
00:38:53,438 --> 00:38:57,918
Freshen up a bit, and
I'll make you some snacks.

326
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:04,173
- Yes?
- Run a bath for her.

327
00:39:07,968 --> 00:39:09,733
- May I say something?
- Yes?

328
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:12,517
I got a chance
to say it now.

329
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,530
Young master was right when he said
his wife was as lovely as a full moon!

330
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:22,946
But now the moon
is blemished.

331
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:27,600
What nonsense! Okay, tell me.
Do you like the house?

332
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,944
- I've not...
- I simply forgot!

333
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,124
You haven't even seen it as yet.
Come on. I'll take you around.

334
00:39:35,534 --> 00:39:40,216
See this. A lake in the front.
Hills behind. Jungle all around.

335
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:45,533
Everyone says this house is
the crown of Nainital. But...

336
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:50,925
...somebody cast an evil eye.
And the young master never returned.

337
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,864
Master fell ill. He was a quiet man,
but now he gets irritated easily.

338
00:39:56,078 --> 00:40:00,381
Madam was very hot tempered.
But now she's very quiet.

339
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:05,070
Chatting away again? You are
wanted downstairs. She's my sister.

340
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,762
- A born chatter box!
- Shut up!

341
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:12,235
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar!

342
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:18,637
Shirker! Less work, more noise!
Honestly, I've to do all the work.

343
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,696
Really? Then you're a good boy.
What's your name?

344
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:30,168
I came to call her and got chatty.
I forgot I've to polish shoes.

345
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:32,048
I'll go now.
See you later.

346
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:43,566
What's going on?
Have you lost your senses?

347
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:46,102
Not at all.

348
00:40:46,803 --> 00:40:50,655
Try being a "horsey" one day.
You'll have fun!

349
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:58,204
- Your breakfast, father.
- Why you, dear? Where's the maid?

350
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:03,556
You don't like servants making
food, so I made it myself.

351
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:09,322
- Taste it. I think you'll like it.
- Of course I will.

352
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:15,202
Eat slowly, friend. You're eating
as though you're starving for a week!

353
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:21,138
You have a long life.
We were just talking about you.

354
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:22,526
Have a seat.

355
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:26,488
I heard that your son's wife, and
son are here. Thought I'd meet them.

356
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:31,365
This is my daughter-in-law.
And this is Munna, my grandson.

357
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,946
This is my doctor. But more
of a friend than a doctor.

358
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:44,219
Honestly, you have a very
beautiful daughter-in-law.

359
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:51,310
Don't cast your evil eye on her!
And today instead of taking my B.P...

360
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,490
...better check your own.
Now I don't even think that I'm ill.

361
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,218
That's very good. And now, stop
all the medicines, and take a tonic.

362
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,123
- Forget it!
- Doctor, don't you worry.

363
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:10,500
I'm responsible for his welfare now.
I'll get the tonic.

364
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:16,415
Keep these, and if any other
brand comes, keep that too.

365
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:21,727
Don't tell him, tell me!
He doesn't know that...

366
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:26,002
-.. "scotch" is a black market item.
- Then buy it in "black" for me!

367
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:29,720
Really? Too good!
What will it be? "Black Dog"?

368
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:32,266
You idiot! What are
you blabbering?

369
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:34,838
Welcome, Madam.
What do you want?

370
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:39,700
- You? - I had come
for some tonic.

371
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:41,407
Too good! I'll just get it.

372
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:45,958
- How come you're here?
- Madhavi? You, here?

373
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:51,488
- You meant me?
- Yes. Didn't you recognize me?

374
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:58,403
I'm Rakesh. We studied together
in the Lucknow University.

375
00:42:59,071 --> 00:43:02,472
You've forgotten, that I had failed
for 3 years and yet reached the final?

376
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:07,481
- Well, I...
- Better change your glasses.

377
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,825
She's Poonam. Shekhar's wife,
and daughter-in-law of Diwanji!

378
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:17,795
But how can that be?
The same face, same complexion...

379
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:23,222
-... same eyes, same voice!
- Don't get shocked. You're mistaken.

380
00:43:23,473 --> 00:43:26,566
Sometimes two people
can have same features.

381
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,590
I suppose so.

382
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:34,315
- Here are your things, and the bill.
- It can be paid later.

383
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:39,010
- Haven't you packed those bottles?
- I'll pack them now.

384
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,510
- A real sample!
- Your brother too!

385
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:42,936
Step aside, please.

386
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,735
I wish to ask you something.
- Yes?

387
00:43:48,223 --> 00:43:54,197
Need man take support of deceit for
peaceful living and satisfaction?

388
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:56,450
I don't get you.

389
00:43:56,844 --> 00:44:01,490
Every man has some sorrow. If liquor
could erase all the sorrows...

390
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,514
...every man would
be an alcoholic.

391
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:10,005
Good bye.

392
00:44:10,122 --> 00:44:12,373
Here's your whiskey, sir.

393
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:18,245
- Cancel it!
- Very strange!

394
00:44:19,648 --> 00:44:21,627
Pappu! Where are you?

395
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:29,896
- Where are you?
- Say "I'm here". Come let's run.

396
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,216
Mummy's coming...

397
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:39,035
- Where are you?
- I'm here! Let's go...

398
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:49,155
Had I not seen with my own eyes,
I wouldn't have believed it!

399
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:55,727
That you can laugh and play too!
- Pappu forced me to play.

400
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:58,257
I forgot everything
in this madness.

401
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:04,792
Madness? Joy is a ripple in
the mind. Nobody can stop it.

402
00:45:07,242 --> 00:45:12,967
Poetry can entertain the mind,
but not convince it.

403
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:18,674
A mind that has been crushed
by misfortune and social norms...

404
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:20,823
...why console it
with false sympathy?

405
00:45:22,398 --> 00:45:26,807
You don't know the power of the mind!
A mind that has feelings...

406
00:45:26,882 --> 00:45:29,999
... determination, can break
every kind of bondage.

407
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:36,264
And what about the mind that
has no hope or emotion within?

408
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:39,843
Whose life is like
a cut, drifting kite?

409
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:48,771
- These words are from your poem.
- That's my unfinished poem.

410
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:55,002
Even a finished poem can't change
the fate of a kite, once it's cut!

411
00:45:55,978 --> 00:46:02,295
Its sorrows drift it here and there
with no direction or destination.

412
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:18,527
- When did you come, Kamal?
- Great! You've begun to step out.

413
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,805
I deliberately took him
to the lawyer. The doctor said...

414
00:46:23,057 --> 00:46:26,529
- ...he must go out a bit.
- His treatment seems to be working.

415
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:31,041
- His treatment? Say her care.
- You're right.

416
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:35,806
She and her son have brought
liveliness and joy to your home.

417
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:38,835
Please sit down.
I'll just send some coffee.

418
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:44,394
So! Why are you here
and how are you?

419
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,084
I'm fine. Actually,
I came to invite you folks.

420
00:46:48,294 --> 00:46:51,138
- What for?
- My birthday party.

421
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:53,537
- Thought you should come too.
- Bless you.

422
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,353
Congratulations.

423
00:46:57,124 --> 00:47:01,082
But as you know, we
don't go to any party.

424
00:47:01,225 --> 00:47:04,698
If none of you come, my
party will be incomplete.

425
00:47:05,015 --> 00:47:08,866
Do one thing. Talk to Poonam.
If she agrees, we won't mind.

426
00:47:08,977 --> 00:47:15,295
She never steps out! I've told her
many times. But she doesn't listen.

427
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:19,324
She doesn't listen to her.
You try. She may agree.

428
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:24,093
Where's the harm in trying?
It'll do her good. She'll enjoy it.

429
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:30,603
- Then I'll try my best!
- Look, you also talk to her.

430
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:36,392
You?

431
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:38,867
- May I come in?
- Of course.

432
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:42,625
- I hope I didn't disturb you.
- No. Sit down.

433
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,209
Thanks. Your in-laws were
complaining about you.

434
00:47:47,806 --> 00:47:50,650
About me?
What wrong did I do?

435
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:54,406
They said you
don't go anywhere.

436
00:47:56,357 --> 00:48:00,316
- Not even to your neighbors.
- It's become a kind of habit.

437
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,130
I just don't feel
like going anywhere.

438
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:09,972
- If you're invited out of love...
- Then I'll ask to be excused.

439
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:16,972
- But why are you asking all this?
- I'm having a party at the club.

440
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:22,219
Thought I'd ask you,
and that you won't refuse.

441
00:48:24,306 --> 00:48:28,644
The question of my attending
your party simply doesn't arise.

442
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:33,263
It's nothing special.
Some friends and officers will come.

443
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:36,617
Actually, it's my birthday.

444
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:40,615
Really? My best wishes.

445
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:44,949
Just best wishes?
Won't you come?

446
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:50,401
- I'm sorry.
- Your in-laws have no objection.

447
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,264
If you're willing,
they don't mind.

448
00:48:54,688 --> 00:48:59,310
They mustn't have thought
of the wagging tongues!

449
00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:05,810
I thought I'd convince you.
If what people say...

450
00:49:05,882 --> 00:49:11,226
... means more than your dear ones,
I leave the decision to you. Bye!

451
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:27,049
- Whom are you waiting for?
- For us! We're here.

452
00:49:35,428 --> 00:49:38,095
- These garlands of flowers...
- Please accept as yours.

453
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:41,577
What nonsense is this!
Idiot!

454
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:47,479
- You know us all right!
- Actually, the world calls us that.

455
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,310
Welcome, Poonam.
I knew you'd come.

456
00:50:00,387 --> 00:50:05,460
- My in-laws forced me to come.
- How happy I am to have you here.

457
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:12,719
She is Diwanji's daughter-in-law
and my childhood friend's wife...

458
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:14,848
Poonam.
And this is...

459
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:24,020
We've already met. I think,
you better be born fast.

460
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:28,290
Cut the cake quickly.
My stomach's rumbling.

461
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,758
That day you may have
felt bad about what I said.

462
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:40,775
But honestly, Madhavi was just
like you. I've a group photo too.

463
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:44,878
- I'll find it for you. - Show it
to her and confuse her more.

464
00:50:46,307 --> 00:50:47,730
Cut the cake.

465
00:50:58,301 --> 00:51:00,517
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

466
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:06,634
Friends, from all
of us here...

467
00:51:06,712 --> 00:51:09,485
...hearty congratulations
to Kamal on his birthday.

468
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:16,860
But on this joyous occasion
we've a request for him.

469
00:51:16,932 --> 00:51:21,057
- That he recite one of his poems...
- In his sweet voice...

470
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:27,326
... with melodious music,
and oblige us all.

471
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,494
- You'll have to recite it now.
- In front of all...

472
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:35,111
They're all insisting,
so sing it for them.

473
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,035
Since you're asking
me to, I'll oblige.

474
00:51:44,082 --> 00:51:47,377
Friends, I had stopped
penning poetry.

475
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:52,662
But for some days now, I felt my
dormant emotions awaking.

476
00:51:53,745 --> 00:51:55,368
My desires aroused.

477
00:51:56,805 --> 00:52:00,241
The shape those emotions and
desires have given birth to...

478
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,376
I'm presenting before
you as a song.

479
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:32,884
<i>Love is blind and crazy.</i>

480
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:40,439
<i>It's above all
joys and sorrows.</i>

481
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:20,719
<i>It's like
playing with fire.</i>

482
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:28,173
<i>Which burns everything.</i>

483
00:53:45,124 --> 00:53:51,244
<i>Even then people
dare to love.</i>

484
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:59,134
<i>It's above all
joys and sorrows.</i>

485
00:54:00,815 --> 00:54:06,864
<i>Love is blind and crazy.</i>

486
00:54:08,642 --> 00:54:14,371
<i>It's above all
joys and sorrows.</i>

487
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:42,577
<i>Love cannot be hidden...</i>

488
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:50,055
<i>even if one wants to.</i>

489
00:55:07,195 --> 00:55:13,609
<i>The heart finds
its own match.</i>

490
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:21,262
<i>It's above all
joys and sorrows.</i>

491
00:55:50,668 --> 00:55:57,476
<i>Listen to what
this poet once said...</i>

492
00:55:58,096 --> 00:56:04,854
<i>even the world cannot
stop its flow.</i>

493
00:56:21,074 --> 00:56:27,396
<i>It pours out
automatically.</i>

494
00:56:28,462 --> 00:56:34,618
<i>It's above all
joys and sorrows.</i>

495
00:56:36,115 --> 00:56:42,307
<i>Love is blind and crazy.</i>

496
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:49,993
<i>It's above all
joys and sorrows.</i>

497
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:04,942
The silence of this street seems
so nice after that noisy party.

498
00:57:07,142 --> 00:57:08,422
What were you lost in?

499
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:16,110
I'm trying to free myself from your
beautiful poetry and sweet voice.

500
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,177
- This means you liked my song.
- Very much!

501
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:26,433
Truly, had I not come today, I'd
have never known how well you sing.

502
00:57:26,686 --> 00:57:31,547
Good enough! I'm happy
that you enjoyed my party.

503
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:37,222
I was scared that in your
party there wouldn't be...

504
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:38,323
What?

505
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:42,294
...what usually happens in parties.
Chaos and getting drunk.

506
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:49,076
Does man need a false support for
peaceful living and satisfaction?

507
00:57:49,464 --> 00:57:50,494
What?

508
00:57:50,577 --> 00:57:52,308
Didn't you say this
in that general stores?

509
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,994
Since then I've given up
the false support of alcohol.

510
00:57:58,158 --> 00:58:01,762
Can anybody leave liquor
at somebody's request?

511
00:58:03,722 --> 00:58:05,868
There's a difference between
anybody, somebody and you!

512
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:16,723
A small gift...

513
00:58:17,249 --> 00:58:19,300
On your birthday.

514
00:58:20,032 --> 00:58:22,462
I felt awkward giving it
to you in front of everyone.

515
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,657
This will be my most valuable gift,
because you gave it to me.

516
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:33,202
Forgive me. I came to
you on first terms.

517
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:38,799
One is not formal with those
who are younger. And then...

518
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:41,934
...informality has
its own intimacy.

519
00:58:42,844 --> 00:58:48,441
I've learnt one thing from you.
One needn't marry to come close.

520
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:52,850
Whomever you get intimacy
from is your very own.

521
00:58:57,946 --> 00:58:58,976
Let's go.

522
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:03,422
There you are!
We were waiting for you.

523
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:07,975
- How was the party?
- Fine. But I missed you both.

524
00:59:08,056 --> 00:59:12,087
- Poonam made up for us.
- True. Okay, I'll go now.

525
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,649
- There's a letter from your father.
- Me too. Same old story. Marriage!

526
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:21,328
That's all very well, but
you'll have to accept it one day.

527
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:25,125
The girl's coming with her mother.
See her and decide.

528
00:59:25,283 --> 00:59:30,693
He knows it. You also pen him.
I'm not interested in marriage!

529
00:59:31,808 --> 00:59:32,839
Bye.

530
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:39,798
- This boy will never heed.
- He's been wronged.

531
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:44,080
- Can't he forget her?
- Do you know about him?

532
00:59:44,744 --> 00:59:48,384
Yes. His servant
told me everything.

533
00:59:49,682 --> 00:59:54,271
Do one thing. Find out what's
on his mind when you chat.

534
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:58,756
He may listen to you.
We've given up convincing him!

535
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:00,485
Okay.

536
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:05,916
Look, my dear. Behave properly.
Kamal is an excellent boy.

537
01:00:07,218 --> 01:00:10,727
Boys are all the same.
I know how to handle them.

538
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,266
Don't be childish however.
Here they come.

539
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:19,725
- This is Kamal.
- Greet her...

540
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:22,301
Bless you.
Come this way.

541
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:28,068
This is my daughter.
And her pet name is Munni!

542
01:00:28,527 --> 01:00:33,981
She's always spoiling my name!
I'm not a kid anymore.

543
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:37,600
Meet this gentleman.
He's Mr. Kamal Sinha.

544
01:00:39,028 --> 01:00:42,431
What's "Hi"?
She's Mrs. Shekhar.

545
01:00:43,132 --> 01:00:45,634
Why are you standing?
Come and sit.

546
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:46,948
Yes. Let's sit.

547
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:56,165
- Is this your first visit here?
- Not for me, but it is, for her.

548
01:00:56,381 --> 01:00:59,985
It's my second visit!
I had come when I was a kid.

549
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:02,457
But it's your first visit
since you've grown up.

550
01:01:04,102 --> 01:01:06,770
Who told you that your
daughter's grown up?

551
01:01:08,353 --> 01:01:12,064
- You seem a jovial man.
- Yes, I pull legs now and then!

552
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:14,845
- What will you have?
- Tea.

553
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:17,591
- And you?
- Same, what about you?

554
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:21,598
I'll tell you her choice.
A double "Tootie-frootie"!

555
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:27,826
- How did you guess?
- Children usually like such things.

556
01:01:29,844 --> 01:01:34,598
- You're teasing me already!
- Naturally! Who else will he tease?

557
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:40,168
- Then has he liked my Munni?
- So you thought her Munni...

558
01:01:44,966 --> 01:01:46,762
Please start...

559
01:01:54,282 --> 01:02:01,551
<i>My name is Shabnam.</i>

560
01:02:03,538 --> 01:02:06,894
<i>People fondly
call me Shabbo.</i>

561
01:02:30,089 --> 01:02:32,405
<i>Recognize me?</i>

562
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:35,693
<i>We've met.</i>

563
01:02:37,402 --> 01:02:38,713
<i>That night...?</i>

564
01:02:40,487 --> 01:02:41,514
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

565
01:02:43,883 --> 01:02:45,501
<i>It's a secret.</i>

566
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,455
<i>And the secret
will remain a secret.</i>

567
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,918
<i>My name is Shabnam.</i>

568
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:56,983
<i>People fondly
call me Shabbo.</i>

569
01:02:58,199 --> 01:02:59,617
<i>What's your name...?</i>

570
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:06,336
<i>Meena, Leena,
Anju, Manju...?</i>

571
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:10,883
<i>or is it Madhu?</i>

572
01:03:30,642 --> 01:03:35,524
<i>The bridal
music all night.</i>

573
01:03:37,262 --> 01:03:40,583
<i>There I was.
So were you...</i>

574
01:03:42,115 --> 01:03:43,142
<i>and...</i>

575
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:48,587
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

576
01:03:49,741 --> 01:03:50,768
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

577
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:55,243
<i>I'm not going
to tell anyone.</i>

578
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:01,276
<i>Know what...?
My name is Shabnam.</i>

579
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:06,065
<i>Out of love, people
call me Shabbo.</i>

580
01:04:07,522 --> 01:04:09,046
<i>And what's your name...?</i>

581
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:14,902
<i>Meena, Leena,
Anju, Manju...?</i>

582
01:04:17,886 --> 01:04:19,234
<i>or is it Madhu?</i>

583
01:05:10,728 --> 01:05:18,015
These stains can be washed away, but
what about the one's on your soul.

584
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:36,608
How long will I pay for my mistake?
I'm not asking anything from You.

585
01:05:37,035 --> 01:05:41,549
But please don't take the
peace of mind you've given me.

586
01:05:43,602 --> 01:05:47,939
Peace of mind lies in love.
And love is no mistake.

587
01:05:49,232 --> 01:05:50,262
You?

588
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,801
I phoned your place and
was told you had come here.

589
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:56,248
Anyway, today I saw the
deity and her devotee!

590
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:02,605
Last night you came away, and I got
caught between that Munni and Mummy!

591
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:07,197
I deliberately left, so that
you all could chat comfortably.

592
01:06:07,823 --> 01:06:11,817
Comfortably? They forced
me to dine with them.

593
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,034
It was very late, so I
went home and slept.

594
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:16,709
- You slept at least.
- Meaning?

595
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:19,700
I meant Munni mustn't
have slept at all.

596
01:06:20,022 --> 01:06:24,358
- Both were dozing while eating.
- Really? Then what was decided?

597
01:06:24,436 --> 01:06:27,243
- That's left to you.
- Congratulations!

598
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:32,841
- You'll make a first class couple!
- You're very right.

599
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:37,770
But remember, my salary is less and
that fatso's ice creams cost more.

600
01:06:42,993 --> 01:06:45,137
You look so beautiful
when you laugh!

601
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,728
I've been thinking a lot about
one thing since yesterday.

602
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:57,854
- What about?
- Do you have a twin?

603
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,933
That shopkeeper mentioned it,
and so did that cheap dancer.

604
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:07,688
And the strangest thing is,
the girl that I was to wed...

605
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:08,978
her name was Madhu too!

606
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:16,517
If you meet that Madhu again,
will you be able to forgive her?

607
01:07:21,427 --> 01:07:26,048
I've nothing against her today.
The pain she gave...

608
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:28,193
...has been over-shadowed
by somebody else.

609
01:07:29,906 --> 01:07:32,609
- Who?
- You!

610
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,893
May I go now?

611
01:07:54,128 --> 01:07:57,220
We're going to the same place,
by the same road, but in 2 boats.

612
01:07:57,881 --> 01:08:00,689
Isn't it possible for us
to walk together?

613
01:08:36,922 --> 01:08:42,115
<i>A place where
you do not live...</i>

614
01:08:42,682 --> 01:08:47,841
<i>I wouldn't even
walk across, my love.</i>

615
01:08:48,547 --> 01:08:54,226
<i>A path that does
not lead to you...</i>

616
01:08:54,307 --> 01:08:59,406
<i>I wouldn't ever
step on it.</i>

617
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:05,468
<i>A place where
you do not live...</i>

618
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,824
<i>For all the merriment
life offers...</i>

619
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:36,920
<i>for all the colorful
flowers that blossom.</i>

620
01:09:55,319 --> 01:10:00,454
<i>And so much for
what Spring offers...</i>

621
01:10:00,872 --> 01:10:06,349
<i>the garden where a
thorn pierces your feet...</i>

622
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:20,650
<i>from that garden, a flower
I'd never want to have.</i>

623
01:10:21,476 --> 01:10:26,670
<i>A place where
you do not live...</i>

624
01:10:44,795 --> 01:10:50,273
<i>Break all norms
and customs...</i>

625
01:10:50,348 --> 01:10:55,683
<i>come to me,
draped in love.</i>

626
01:11:13,805 --> 01:11:18,963
<i>Or I will leave
this world itself.</i>

627
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,901
<i>A place where your
memories torment me...</i>

628
01:11:34,175 --> 01:11:39,369
<i>I wouldn't want to
spend a moment there.</i>

629
01:11:40,178 --> 01:11:45,371
<i>A place where
you do not live...</i>

630
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:50,828
<i>that place, I'd never
want to even pass by.</i>

631
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:11,156
I'm stepping out after a long time!
This lake. That temple...

632
01:12:11,262 --> 01:12:14,628
this club. Everything is
as it was to the world.

633
01:12:15,745 --> 01:12:19,454
But after Shekhar's death,
nothing was the same for us!

634
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:26,552
See those boats? Look how they're
playing around with the waves.

635
01:12:27,006 --> 01:12:29,329
- It's the first time...
- You, my friend?

636
01:12:31,281 --> 01:12:36,423
- How did the sun rise in
the West? - She forced me!

637
01:12:36,494 --> 01:12:39,896
Good thing too!
I was tired of lecturing him!

638
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:45,318
He just refused to go out, or
meet anyone! He invited illness.

639
01:12:45,983 --> 01:12:49,798
- From today make it a rule!
- Lecturing again? Sit down!

640
01:12:49,911 --> 01:12:53,098
Sit, eh? You get up!
There's the club.

641
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:58,629
To pass time we'll play cards.
Old friends will be happy to see you.

642
01:12:58,947 --> 01:13:03,177
- No. I... - Go on, father.
You'll enjoy yourself.

643
01:13:03,257 --> 01:13:06,409
- That's what I mean too.
- Okay. Let's go.

644
01:13:07,462 --> 01:13:11,385
You'll get bored sitting here.
Munna's alone, so go home.

645
01:13:11,807 --> 01:13:13,786
- I'll come with him.
- Okay.

646
01:13:18,411 --> 01:13:21,325
Your daughter-in-law
is really an angel.

647
01:13:21,886 --> 01:13:25,465
She has changed the scene totally.
She has made you forget your tragedy.

648
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:30,814
When I think about her,
my heart literally breaks!

649
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:35,119
- What'll happen to her after I die?
- May I say something?

650
01:13:36,623 --> 01:13:40,166
If I was in your place,
I'd have got her remarried.

651
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:45,583
- Why get so cross about it?
- Why did you say such a thing?

652
01:13:45,868 --> 01:13:49,612
I just suggested it.
If you're offended, I'm sorry.

653
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,740
Come on, let's go.

654
01:14:00,048 --> 01:14:01,885
Take the car back.

655
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,161
Toys?

656
01:14:09,503 --> 01:14:12,275
- Who brought these toys?
- I did!

657
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,666
- For your son.
- You?

658
01:14:19,129 --> 01:14:22,387
Thank God you remember me.

659
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:25,870
Why are you here?
What was the need?

660
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:31,008
I missed you. Came to know
you were here, so I came.

661
01:14:31,606 --> 01:14:34,451
- Go away from here!
- So soon?

662
01:14:35,882 --> 01:14:40,148
But it'll take me some
time to tell my story.

663
01:14:41,616 --> 01:14:44,673
She's making tea for me.
There's nobody else at home.

664
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:49,566
Honestly, Madhu.
I'm really repenting.

665
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:54,022
That day I couldn't value
your love. Please forgive me.

666
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:58,010
- That Madhu is dead! - Then so
is that Kailash you knew.

667
01:14:58,671 --> 01:15:03,480
Look. I know
everything about you.

668
01:15:03,512 --> 01:15:08,063
- Why not start a new life together?
- Don't talk nonsense!

669
01:15:08,343 --> 01:15:12,372
I hate the sight of you!
Get out of here! Go!

670
01:15:13,036 --> 01:15:16,128
Go! Go, I say!

671
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:23,313
- Peace! Peace!
- You?

672
01:15:25,095 --> 01:15:29,219
Thank God your wrath hit my foot.
Had it hit my head...

673
01:15:29,997 --> 01:15:31,027
Who are you?

674
01:15:31,108 --> 01:15:35,481
I'm Kailash.
She's my distant relation.

675
01:15:36,217 --> 01:15:39,309
- Very happy to meet you...
- I'm Kamal.

676
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:45,564
Now tell me, her aunt sent
some toys for her son...

677
01:15:45,637 --> 01:15:47,189
Where have I erred in this?

678
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:53,097
- Why lose your temper over this?
- But she's right in a way.

679
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:57,828
When she was widowed, her
Aunt didn't care about her.

680
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:02,732
When she found out Poonam had
married well, she apologized.

681
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:08,435
This is common in relatives.
Poonam, keep this toy to please him.

682
01:16:12,224 --> 01:16:16,325
- Get the tea here.
- I'm very obliged to you.

683
01:16:16,847 --> 01:16:20,426
If you hadn't come, I don't know
how this relation would've remained.

684
01:16:22,338 --> 01:16:25,810
- Sit down. Have some tea.
- Excuse me...

685
01:16:25,883 --> 01:16:28,454
It's against norms to drink
water, let alone tea from...

686
01:16:28,525 --> 01:16:33,455
...the house of a girl
you've given away in marriage.

687
01:16:36,068 --> 01:16:38,911
I'm putting up at
The Hotel Politana.

688
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:42,038
Phone and tell me if your
son liked the toys or not.

689
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:49,447
Very interesting and over smart
this relation of yours.

690
01:16:49,657 --> 01:16:54,303
- He's not my relation. I'll pour.
- Where's everybody?

691
01:16:54,661 --> 01:16:58,620
Mother has taken Munna out.
And father, to the doctor.

692
01:16:58,693 --> 01:17:03,693
I had come to meet him, in fact.
He had to sign an agreement.

693
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:10,262
I've barred you to play this game.
It brings ill-luck!

694
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:13,426
That means you've
been lucky!

695
01:17:14,507 --> 01:17:18,216
- I've just offered a peanut today.
- Congratulations!

696
01:17:18,852 --> 01:17:22,146
- Did the bird eat it?
- Of course! What else will she do?

697
01:17:22,919 --> 01:17:24,649
It's golden.

698
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:30,243
There's a lot of difference between
this wealth and Madhavi's uncle's.

699
01:17:31,016 --> 01:17:34,939
- And what about Madhavi and me?
- My darling...

700
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:40,851
She a flower. You, a fruit.
A flower's scent fulfills the heart.

701
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:44,286
And the fruit sates hunger!

702
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:52,275
A flower is smelt and discarded.
But a fruit is good for health.

703
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:57,291
Then my dear, fix me a
drink with your own hands!

704
01:17:57,396 --> 01:17:58,534
I'll just get it.

705
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:07,367
You're so enticing! I can
forget everyone, but not you.

706
01:18:08,657 --> 01:18:10,767
What are your further plans?

707
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:14,209
I don't think myself.

708
01:18:15,678 --> 01:18:18,770
I make others think for me!

709
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,800
Madhavi's plans...

710
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:25,575
... will be known,
tomorrow at 6 p.m.!

711
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:31,555
Welcome Madhu...
I mean, Poonam.

712
01:18:32,812 --> 01:18:36,142
- I knew you'd definitely come.
- Why have you called me?

713
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:38,964
Still playing a game of
hide and seek with me?

714
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:46,777
But honestly, how lovely you
look in these white clothes!

715
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:49,351
- Shut up!
- Okay.

716
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:54,455
Think my lips as sealed.
And if you wish...

717
01:18:54,535 --> 01:18:57,794
- ...I'll keep silent forever.
- What the hell do you want?

718
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:03,525
I hear that your in-laws
are worth 800,000 to a million!

719
01:19:04,788 --> 01:19:09,789
- What!
- Actually it's not yesterday...

720
01:19:09,862 --> 01:19:13,820
... that worries me, it's
tomorrow. It's just that...

721
01:19:14,172 --> 01:19:18,367
Half the share is mine in
the hand that you've played!

722
01:19:19,108 --> 01:19:22,438
I never thought
you'd be so mean!

723
01:19:23,348 --> 01:19:27,934
But remember, I'll never let you
succeed in this evil plan!

724
01:19:28,074 --> 01:19:32,067
Great! You weren't with
me, even in true love.

725
01:19:32,662 --> 01:19:34,677
And now you want to turn
away from unholy plans too?

726
01:19:35,754 --> 01:19:41,064
Don't shout! I'm told,
even the trees have ears!

727
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:46,382
Suppose somebody finds out you're
not the real daughter-in-law?

728
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:51,941
Let go of me! And if you try
to meet me again, you had it!

729
01:20:16,255 --> 01:20:19,160
- Had you gone out?
- Yes.

730
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:22,356
Behind the compound.
Near the lake.

731
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:25,928
But why are you scared?

732
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:29,838
I think there was a wild
animal in the bushes.

733
01:20:30,885 --> 01:20:33,319
Possible. A wolf often
visits that area.

734
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,380
Yes. It was a wolf!

735
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,622
Don't go alone
there henceforth.

736
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:46,126
Here are Rs.5000.
Keep them safely with you.

737
01:20:46,903 --> 01:20:49,288
You keep it, mother.

738
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:55,991
I'm going on a pilgrimage soon.
Also, now it's your responsibility.

739
01:20:57,108 --> 01:20:58,141
Here.

740
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:13,972
- What is it? - Nothing.
I just wanted to ask...

741
01:21:14,051 --> 01:21:17,566
- Was the wolf small, or huge?
- Why are you concerned?

742
01:21:17,638 --> 01:21:22,021
- Go and do your work!
- All right. Why do you get angry?

743
01:21:30,332 --> 01:21:33,919
What's this? You've begun
without me? Such desperation?

744
01:21:34,234 --> 01:21:37,191
You don't come, so...
When did you come, my dear?

745
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,470
This is Kamal's sister.

746
01:21:42,071 --> 01:21:45,931
My brother praises you a lot.
But his praise falls short!

747
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:51,364
- You're more beautiful.
- You all sit. I'll get some tea.

748
01:21:51,685 --> 01:21:54,987
Some tea will not do.
We're here for dinner. Period.

749
01:21:56,457 --> 01:22:00,661
My wife left on a pilgrimage today.
Else you'd have met.

750
01:22:00,811 --> 01:22:05,787
Why did she take the trouble, when
her daughter-in-law is an angel?

751
01:22:05,966 --> 01:22:10,039
- That's why I stayed back.
- How long will you be here?

752
01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:14,492
- Till Holi. I've friends with me.
- She'll bore you for 3-4 days!

753
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,952
- What! I'll bore you?
- They're going on a picnic tomorrow.

754
01:22:19,412 --> 01:22:22,855
- You join us too.
- I don't go anywhere anyway.

755
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:28,258
- And I'm not fond of picnics.
- So what? Just give us company.

756
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:33,031
This is once in a while.
And you're always cooped up in here.

757
01:22:33,205 --> 01:22:35,710
- You'll like it also.
- Very true.

758
01:22:36,244 --> 01:22:38,014
Now no excuses will do!

759
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:48,298
- Why did you throw that flower?
- I was just looking at it.

760
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:56,861
Flowers look nice only at two places.
At the feet of the Lord...

761
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,177
...and in a woman's hair.

762
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:02,365
Not in every woman's hair!

763
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,699
- May I ask something?
- Yes.

764
01:23:08,504 --> 01:23:10,344
You were having
fun some time back.

765
01:23:11,464 --> 01:23:16,892
It seemed your past was like
this stream... bubbly!

766
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:19,994
- And today?
- Today?

767
01:23:20,764 --> 01:23:23,923
It's like this lake.
Silent on top...

768
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,474
... but, with countless
desires in its depths!

769
01:23:29,124 --> 01:23:32,842
In life, these depths of the
lake are not everything.

770
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:36,328
There is much more.
Like...

771
01:23:36,752 --> 01:23:40,090
- ...these flowers that smile.
- And wilt away too!

772
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:44,763
- This evening that is enchanting.
- And then gets lost in the dark!

773
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,248
If you want to, you can
get out of this dark...

774
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:56,531
... and touch the glory of the sky.
- For that, one needs strong arms.

775
01:23:59,603 --> 01:24:02,452
True love is the biggest
support in life.

776
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:05,072
Hey...

777
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:17,056
The stream is below and the picnic
spot is behind. So, why look up?

778
01:24:17,972 --> 01:24:19,706
- I was watching a kite.
- Kite?

779
01:24:21,072 --> 01:24:24,826
Trees are blossoming, flowers are
glowing and the coffee-pot is steaming!

780
01:24:25,148 --> 01:24:27,298
- We came for you.
- Let's go.

781
01:24:28,701 --> 01:24:32,560
Why did you prepare the coffee?
We brought you here to have fun.

782
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:36,568
- But I think you're bored.
- Your brother's bored.

783
01:24:36,852 --> 01:24:39,428
- Do something about him.
- Why, what happened?

784
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:45,236
Insult! Are we so bad looking for him
to stare at a kite in the sky?

785
01:24:45,386 --> 01:24:48,307
You're unbiased.
You decide on this.

786
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:52,244
It could be that
some people like kites.

787
01:24:52,735 --> 01:24:55,371
As compared to us?
Tell us, sir...

788
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:59,110
...what's so special in a kite
for it to attract someone?

789
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:04,472
Attracting someone is no skill.
Getting closer to someone is.

790
01:25:05,519 --> 01:25:08,963
A skill that a kite possess.
Colored like a rainbow.

791
01:25:09,385 --> 01:25:13,982
Having the flight of imagination.
Sways in the wind, kisses the clouds.

792
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:18,085
Agile as lighting.
A beautiful dancer is a kite!

793
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:23,344
Wonderful! Today I realized that
a kite is a poem. What say you?

794
01:25:23,805 --> 01:25:27,321
A kite is not a poem.
But he has made it one!

795
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:33,731
Poetry is not made, it just comes.
When somebody's beauty...

796
01:25:33,977 --> 01:25:35,853
... reflects through the eyes,
into the heart and stays there.

797
01:25:38,401 --> 01:25:43,971
Beauty is that which pulls anyone
towards it, with its fragile string.

798
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,282
Which intoxicates, and makes
you forget everything. Like...

799
01:25:48,362 --> 01:25:50,132
...a beautiful evening
or a stream.

800
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:19,945
<i>This beautiful evening...</i>

801
01:26:20,514 --> 01:26:23,810
<i>drives me out
of my senses.</i>

802
01:26:24,687 --> 01:26:27,983
<i>A string pulls me...</i>

803
01:26:28,476 --> 01:26:31,950
<i>drawing me closer to you.</i>

804
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:40,289
<i>This beautiful evening
drives me out of my senses.</i>

805
01:26:41,343 --> 01:26:48,505
<i>A string pulls me
closer to you.</i>

806
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:05,616
<i>Why do you
keep a distance?</i>

807
01:27:05,999 --> 01:27:09,580
<i>Why don't you
come closer to me?</i>

808
01:27:10,485 --> 01:27:14,302
<i>Your lips...</i>

809
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:18,091
<i>don't ever thirst...</i>

810
01:27:19,353 --> 01:27:26,645
<i>it seems as if you're happily
swallowing a poison.</i>

811
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:34,468
<i>This beautiful evening
drives me out of my senses.</i>

812
01:27:35,384 --> 01:27:42,404
<i>A string pulls at me,
drawing me closer to you.</i>

813
01:28:02,509 --> 01:28:06,362
<i>When I begin to speak...</i>

814
01:28:06,438 --> 01:28:10,042
<i>why do you interrupt me?</i>

815
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:18,147
<i>Why do your beautiful
eyes admonish me?</i>

816
01:28:19,688 --> 01:28:23,364
<i>Your shyness
and modesty...</i>

817
01:28:23,444 --> 01:28:27,297
<i>put a seal on my lips.</i>

818
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,913
<i>This beautiful evening is
driving me out of my senses.</i>

819
01:28:35,545 --> 01:28:42,707
<i>I seem to be pulled by a
string and drawn closer to you.</i>

820
01:29:09,382 --> 01:29:17,178
<i>Like destiny
that has fouled...</i>

821
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:24,492
<i>you are quiet,
like a picture.</i>

822
01:29:25,935 --> 01:29:29,824
<i>Your eyes give you away...</i>

823
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:33,618
<i>and convey your feelings.</i>

824
01:29:33,933 --> 01:29:40,882
<i>This beautiful evening is
driving me out of my senses.</i>

825
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:48,983
<i>It's like a string pulling me,
driving me towards you.</i>

826
01:30:16,074 --> 01:30:17,462
There she comes.

827
01:30:19,587 --> 01:30:22,682
Come. Kailash has been
waiting for you for hours.

828
01:30:23,692 --> 01:30:28,208
He said you had gone on a picnic.
You're so lucky, Poonam.

829
01:30:28,664 --> 01:30:32,767
That you got such a fine
father-in-law. Else, nowadays...

830
01:30:32,838 --> 01:30:36,242
...who allows his widowed
daughter-in-law to move so freely?

831
01:30:37,012 --> 01:30:40,071
I just wish that she be happy.

832
01:30:40,594 --> 01:30:44,235
That she enjoy herself.
Else, she doesn't step out at all!

833
01:30:44,838 --> 01:30:48,549
Wonderful, sir.
Such advanced thoughts!

834
01:30:49,045 --> 01:30:50,575
What brought you here?

835
01:30:51,725 --> 01:30:54,713
See, sir? Didn't I say she
was still cross with me?

836
01:30:55,237 --> 01:30:59,269
Anyway, I came to do my duty.
That too in Madhavi's name.

837
01:31:01,567 --> 01:31:06,713
Don't you remember? My wife.
Your childhood friend.

838
01:31:08,314 --> 01:31:12,346
She writes in her letter
that Aunt's pretty serious.

839
01:31:12,627 --> 01:31:16,933
- She's insisting that I take you.
- I don't want to go anywhere!

840
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:21,868
She can't go at present.
My wife's away and I keep unwell.

841
01:31:22,401 --> 01:31:25,910
I forgot. Never mind.
Some other time.

842
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,288
She has sent an
ordinary gold chain.

843
01:31:30,504 --> 01:31:35,403
- My wife has, that is, for Munna.
- Why did she bother?

844
01:31:35,826 --> 01:31:38,494
I don't want the baby
to wear any gold.

845
01:31:38,547 --> 01:31:40,076
Think, Poonam.

846
01:31:40,321 --> 01:31:45,148
It'll break her heart. She has
got it blessed by the Lord.

847
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:50,750
- If that's so, then take it.
- Okay, if you say so.

848
01:31:52,112 --> 01:31:55,302
- Come and put it
on him yourself. - Go.

849
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:04,629
- Your baby is so sweet.
- Don't touch him!

850
01:32:06,789 --> 01:32:10,751
Okay. Put this on him
with your own hands.

851
01:32:13,084 --> 01:32:16,274
Listen carefully.
I don't like you coming here.

852
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:19,969
But I like to!

853
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:24,176
When I have nothing to do with you,
why should you come and go?

854
01:32:25,188 --> 01:32:28,936
- To continue the old ties.
- I know your intentions very well.

855
01:32:29,432 --> 01:32:32,420
You want to defame me
and take advantage...

856
01:32:32,492 --> 01:32:33,523
Excuse me.

857
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:37,176
But you're also taking advantage
of somebody's helplessness!

858
01:32:40,517 --> 01:32:44,229
Don't you feel sorry
for me, at all?

859
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:50,390
That's more like it!
But my pity has a price, Madhu.

860
01:32:51,474 --> 01:32:55,921
I mean, Poonam. Pay the
price and I'll vanish forever.

861
01:32:56,413 --> 01:32:59,745
And I'll never show you
my dirty face again.

862
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:03,949
Think it over.
Shall I come again?

863
01:33:07,064 --> 01:33:08,937
No need!

864
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:24,521
I've just 5,000/- on me.
I was entrusted with it. But...

865
01:33:24,593 --> 01:33:28,341
Thank you!
Believe me...

866
01:33:28,697 --> 01:33:31,816
if I was not in difficulty,
I would've never troubled you.

867
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:36,794
Really, how great you are!
And I'm so lowly...

868
01:33:37,114 --> 01:33:39,687
You can go now.
And don't forget your promise!

869
01:33:39,863 --> 01:33:43,894
I'll never show you
my face again! Okay...

870
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:50,111
Oh yes! Remember! Don't let
anyone have this chain tested.

871
01:33:50,783 --> 01:33:55,053
Looks golden,
but is of brass!

872
01:33:55,862 --> 01:33:59,989
Just like you! Actually Madhavi,
but impersonating as Poonam!

873
01:34:31,051 --> 01:34:34,561
- Why are you laughing?
- It's funny, that's why.

874
01:34:35,016 --> 01:34:38,040
You gave it so lovingly
and she threw it away.

875
01:34:38,737 --> 01:34:43,291
No matter. I bought it lovingly,
you keep it lovingly.

876
01:34:45,519 --> 01:34:48,365
A golden chain, and
you gave it to me?

877
01:34:49,206 --> 01:34:52,051
Because I'm beginning
to like you.

878
01:34:52,823 --> 01:34:56,463
But don't flaunt it.
Else it'll arouse jealousy!

879
01:34:57,032 --> 01:35:00,958
I won't show it to anyone.
I'll hide it in my trunk.

880
01:35:01,727 --> 01:35:06,210
- When will I see you again?
- Why? Do you have a letter for...

881
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:08,335
- Forget her!
- Sis!

882
01:35:11,222 --> 01:35:15,289
Sis! Where are you?
The milk is boiling over.

883
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:21,823
- Whom were you talking with?
- No one. I was shutting the door.

884
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:26,098
Shut up! Liar! Give milk
to the baby and serve food.

885
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:33,288
Brother! I've brought
you some coffee.

886
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:40,243
- How long will you stay up?
- Till my work is done. I went out...

887
01:35:40,322 --> 01:35:43,511
These papers are so important
if I don't get them ready...

888
01:35:44,069 --> 01:35:48,549
Brother, had you a wife, she'd
have pushed aside the papers...

889
01:35:48,599 --> 01:35:52,524
... ordered you to go to bed,
and said "You're to get up early".

890
01:35:53,015 --> 01:35:55,896
And you'd have hit
the sack in a jiffy!

891
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:57,036
Really?

892
01:35:57,988 --> 01:36:01,106
And if our mother was
here, she'd have said...

893
01:36:01,778 --> 01:36:05,631
Son, if one unknown girl
has let you down...

894
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:10,181
... and run away before marriage,
why do you become a celibate?

895
01:36:11,654 --> 01:36:17,346
Who's becoming a celibate?
Thank God she ran before marriage!

896
01:36:17,532 --> 01:36:21,171
Had she run after, then I'd have
been humiliated even more!

897
01:36:21,857 --> 01:36:26,082
- Now, how did you like my friends?
- They're nice. Very nice.

898
01:36:26,294 --> 01:36:29,697
Really? Then tell me whom
do you like the best?

899
01:36:32,067 --> 01:36:34,842
Just take her name, and we'll
have you married, like this!

900
01:36:37,215 --> 01:36:41,732
The girl who could become my
life-partner is not among them.

901
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:45,549
Then who is it? Whoever
it is, I'll convince her.

902
01:36:46,152 --> 01:36:51,120
Dad's wish will be fulfilled
and your life will be better.

903
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:54,525
Who is she?
Please tell me.

904
01:36:57,001 --> 01:36:59,882
Her name is...

905
01:37:01,627 --> 01:37:04,401
Shekhar's widow!
A mother of a child?

906
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:09,895
Are you mad? Are all the
unmarried girls around dead?

907
01:37:10,634 --> 01:37:13,692
Or has she been luring you
behind those widow's weeds?

908
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:18,316
I would've never thought even...

909
01:37:18,389 --> 01:37:21,862
...that my sister can't differentiate
between muck and holy water!

910
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,052
You may go!

911
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:48,092
<i>There is no desire...
there is no emotion.</i>

912
01:37:49,019 --> 01:37:57,012
<i>What is my life after all? It's
like a detached, drifting kite.</i>

913
01:37:58,461 --> 01:38:06,353
<i>There is no desire,
there is no emotion.</i>

914
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:15,408
<i>What is my life...? It's a
detached, drifting kite.</i>

915
01:38:16,661 --> 01:38:20,372
<i>There is no emotion...</i>

916
01:38:40,213 --> 01:38:48,705
<i>From the skies, I once fell,
my ties broken off.</i>

917
01:38:58,691 --> 01:39:02,758
<i>How has the world...</i>

918
01:39:03,074 --> 01:39:12,066
<i>how has the world
plundered me ever since.</i>

919
01:39:12,254 --> 01:39:19,946
<i>I have no company,
there's no one with me...</i>

920
01:39:21,435 --> 01:39:29,462
<i>what's my life, after all? It's
a broken off, drifting kite.</i>

921
01:39:30,615 --> 01:39:33,912
<i>I have no emotions.</i>

922
01:39:54,124 --> 01:40:02,716
<i>O Lord of my dreams...
what will I give you?</i>

923
01:40:12,311 --> 01:40:16,343
<i>I'm like the leaves
of autumn...</i>

924
01:40:21,318 --> 01:40:25,207
<i>I'm a picture of tears.</i>

925
01:40:26,117 --> 01:40:29,449
<i>This is the real me.</i>

926
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:34,213
<i>This is what I am.</i>

927
01:40:35,193 --> 01:40:39,426
<i>This is my life,
after all...</i>

928
01:40:39,505 --> 01:40:43,109
<i>a detached, drifting kite.</i>

929
01:40:44,096 --> 01:40:47,914
<i>I have no emotions.</i>

930
01:40:55,021 --> 01:40:59,354
- Did you call me? - Yes.
These are the insurance papers.

931
01:40:59,952 --> 01:41:05,741
- Policy papers? - Yes.
They've been redirected here.

932
01:41:07,313 --> 01:41:11,611
- Sign where they've marked it.
- I have to sign?

933
01:41:11,723 --> 01:41:17,441
- Yes. They are on your name.
- So? You sign, as his father.

934
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:22,337
- This won't do in such matter.
- But the thing is...

935
01:41:22,418 --> 01:41:27,000
I know how you feel.
But you will have to sign!

936
01:41:27,243 --> 01:41:32,097
Sign them and send them to Kamal.
He has contacts there...

937
01:41:32,175 --> 01:41:34,223
...the work will be done
quicker. Here you are.

938
01:41:52,313 --> 01:41:57,310
Now what will you do?
Forge Poonam's signature?

939
01:41:58,077 --> 01:42:01,333
Know the consequences?
Jail!

940
01:42:04,015 --> 01:42:07,591
Don't be afraid.
Nobody knows me.

941
01:42:08,425 --> 01:42:11,752
You're Poonam now.
Daughter-in-law of this home.

942
01:42:12,695 --> 01:42:16,472
This is your last responsibility,
and you'll have to fulfill it.

943
01:42:17,592 --> 01:42:20,575
Don't forget, Madhu.
You had given me your word.

944
01:42:21,029 --> 01:42:23,657
You had promised me!

945
01:42:31,385 --> 01:42:36,725
That's it, isn't it Madhu...
Poonam. I just know this...

946
01:42:36,802 --> 01:42:41,619
... that the move you've made,
50 percent of it, belongs to me!

947
01:42:44,467 --> 01:42:49,604
Break these bonds of helplessness.
Your place is at your Kamal's feet.

948
01:42:50,128 --> 01:42:55,229
Tell him the truth and
make your final decision.

949
01:43:18,121 --> 01:43:22,798
- Where are you off to?
- I've been given these papers.

950
01:43:23,157 --> 01:43:26,696
- I'll give them to the driver.
- Must be the policy papers.

951
01:43:28,538 --> 01:43:30,586
Let's see whether she has
signed them properly.

952
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:50,015
Here. Go give them.

953
01:43:58,774 --> 01:44:01,994
Man of my dreams,
today I'm daring to...

954
01:44:02,072 --> 01:44:05,126
...break my
shackles before you.

955
01:44:06,031 --> 01:44:08,244
I want to come clean.

956
01:44:09,156 --> 01:44:14,601
You think I'm Poonam
but in fact, I'm Madhavi.

957
01:44:15,059 --> 01:44:19,179
The same girl who brought
misery in your life.

958
01:44:20,753 --> 01:44:24,944
I made my biggest mistake
when I ran away from the pandal.

959
01:44:46,621 --> 01:44:49,190
- Your dinner's served.
- I'm not hungry.

960
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:52,170
What is it? You ate nothing
in the morning too.

961
01:44:52,838 --> 01:44:53,866
Didn't feel like it.

962
01:44:53,948 --> 01:44:57,759
- Shall I make something else?
- No. I've decided...

963
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:01,608
...that as long as I'm alive.
I won't trouble anyone.

964
01:45:02,316 --> 01:45:04,980
- Go and rest.
- What do you mean?

965
01:45:05,442 --> 01:45:09,218
I don't mind taking care of you.
In fact I feel happy.

966
01:45:09,955 --> 01:45:13,625
Come and eat something.
Come along.

967
01:45:17,317 --> 01:45:18,345
Sit.

968
01:45:20,616 --> 01:45:23,599
An old man is
like an old wall.

969
01:45:24,226 --> 01:45:29,294
- Who should be very careful.
- We depend on this old wall.

970
01:45:29,851 --> 01:45:34,219
For my sake. Don't be adamant.
Eat something.

971
01:45:34,921 --> 01:45:38,070
She's feeding you like a baby.

972
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:43,839
- She's force-feeding me!
- Your papers have come.

973
01:45:43,914 --> 01:45:47,028
- You'll have to sign them.
- Me?

974
01:45:47,281 --> 01:45:49,566
To verify her signature.

975
01:45:50,025 --> 01:45:53,801
Because they're always scared, the
money may go to the wrong man.

976
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:00,440
Even after all this, money always
falls into the wrong hands.

977
01:46:01,657 --> 01:46:05,812
- I'll make some tea.
- No tea. We've come to take you.

978
01:46:06,206 --> 01:46:10,196
- Me? - Yes. It's
Holi in the village.

979
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:13,977
It's a grand affair.
Her friends are coming too.

980
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:16,370
And they insist,
you come too.

981
01:46:17,248 --> 01:46:20,231
- But how?
- Why not?

982
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:23,417
Didn't I say she'll refuse?

983
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:28,558
No. It's not that.
Father is alone. And...

984
01:46:28,637 --> 01:46:32,756
Uncle, we're going tomorrow.
Please send her.

985
01:46:32,907 --> 01:46:37,939
When have I refused?
She has her own will.

986
01:46:38,984 --> 01:46:43,139
- Let her go wherever she likes.
- Come. Hurry up and get ready.

987
01:46:58,204 --> 01:47:01,708
<i>Hey mister... it's the
festival of colors.</i>

988
01:47:38,293 --> 01:47:40,993
<i>I'm not sparing
you today...</i>

989
01:47:45,518 --> 01:47:52,043
<i>I'm not sparing you today, my love.
I'll douse the colors on you.</i>

990
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:06,479
<i>Even if your veil is
drenched, or your blouse...</i>

991
01:48:06,557 --> 01:48:09,364
<i>I'm going to spray
the colors on you.</i>

992
01:48:30,036 --> 01:48:36,906
<i>Each one has his destiny...</i>

993
01:48:36,983 --> 01:48:41,601
<i>...someone laughs and
someone sheds tears...</i>

994
01:48:51,362 --> 01:48:58,515
<i>...if one drenches
another in color...</i>

995
01:48:58,586 --> 01:49:02,813
<i>...yet another wets
her eyes with tears.</i>

996
01:49:12,097 --> 01:49:14,347
<i>Let the excuses be...</i>

997
01:49:15,361 --> 01:49:17,718
<i>what can the
world do anyway?</i>

998
01:49:19,078 --> 01:49:21,150
<i>You're so naive...</i>

999
01:49:21,995 --> 01:49:24,767
<i>I'm going to play
colors with you.</i>

1000
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:32,303
<i>I'm not sparing you today, my love.
I'll douse the colors on you.</i>

1001
01:49:50,659 --> 01:50:03,855
<i>Happiness has broken
off its ties with me.</i>

1002
01:50:11,154 --> 01:50:23,838
<i>Like a fire raging,
left behind by gypsies.</i>

1003
01:50:31,703 --> 01:50:33,953
<i>Grief is but a spark.</i>

1004
01:50:34,725 --> 01:50:37,425
<i>With this spray...</i>

1005
01:50:38,476 --> 01:50:43,958
<i>...here come the revelers...
to spray the colors.</i>

1006
01:50:51,552 --> 01:50:59,318
<i>I'm not sparing you today, my love.
I'll douse the colors on you.</i>

1007
01:51:02,711 --> 01:51:09,509
<i>Even if your veil is
drenched, or your blouse...</i>

1008
01:51:09,589 --> 01:51:12,608
<i>I'm going to spray
the colors on you.</i>

1009
01:52:03,007 --> 01:52:04,038
Why did you do that for?

1010
01:52:06,992 --> 01:52:10,579
You'll wipe it?
It was a signal from God.

1011
01:52:11,525 --> 01:52:13,954
This red powder which is
in your hair now...

1012
01:52:14,688 --> 01:52:17,746
...will shine forever as
an omen for you to be a bride.

1013
01:52:34,503 --> 01:52:36,790
Haven't you slept yet?

1014
01:52:37,771 --> 01:52:41,481
When a young widowed
daughter-in-law regales...

1015
01:52:43,055 --> 01:52:46,243
...then how can an old
father-in-law sleep?

1016
01:52:50,981 --> 01:52:55,840
I've been noticing that you're
out to have a good time.

1017
01:52:56,266 --> 01:52:59,868
How can you say that?
They deliberately put color on me.

1018
01:53:00,332 --> 01:53:03,390
- I shouldn't have gone.
- If you hadn't...

1019
01:53:03,461 --> 01:53:07,728
...then how will this red powder
have shone in a widow's hair?

1020
01:53:08,016 --> 01:53:12,247
What kind of acid-test
do you want me to undergo?

1021
01:53:12,813 --> 01:53:17,921
- I want to know the real you!
- The real me is my luck...

1022
01:53:17,993 --> 01:53:20,008
...which has taken
away everything!

1023
01:53:20,739 --> 01:53:24,450
And now, you want to use
Kamal to set it straight?

1024
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:31,229
- What's this?
- My letter!

1025
01:53:32,003 --> 01:53:38,771
Yes! Your secret! Your
betrayal, your deception!

1026
01:53:39,859 --> 01:53:43,745
I thought you were divinely good.

1027
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:47,954
I gave you love thinking
you were my daughter-in-law.

1028
01:53:48,654 --> 01:53:53,822
I thought you'll be my support.
Gave the child in your care.

1029
01:53:54,495 --> 01:53:58,904
I handed over this household's
prestige, money, everything to you!

1030
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:00,951
And you... you...

1031
01:54:01,031 --> 01:54:06,969
...betray me so badly?
Why? Why? Tell me!

1032
01:54:07,044 --> 01:54:11,204
- You want money, estates?
- No...

1033
01:54:11,285 --> 01:54:13,572
What the hell do you want?

1034
01:54:22,583 --> 01:54:23,792
Happy Holi.

1035
01:54:28,042 --> 01:54:30,223
You! And here?

1036
01:54:32,978 --> 01:54:36,617
Leave it.
There won't be any light.

1037
01:54:37,532 --> 01:54:41,491
- I had pulled out all
the wires! - Rascal!

1038
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:51,921
I couldn't see you out in the open
so I hid here in the dark.

1039
01:54:52,272 --> 01:54:55,946
You devil! You call it decency
to hide in other people's room?

1040
01:54:58,077 --> 01:55:02,201
Great! One thief expects
decency from another one?

1041
01:55:02,909 --> 01:55:07,389
Your father-in-law insulted
me and threw me out!

1042
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:11,530
So I thought I'd go to
someone who was my own.

1043
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:16,116
I know. You want to use my secret
as a shield and loot these people.

1044
01:55:16,189 --> 01:55:23,479
No! I came here today because
it's Holi. A day for lovers.

1045
01:55:24,046 --> 01:55:26,784
I don't want your wealth,
but your heart now.

1046
01:55:27,106 --> 01:55:28,693
You mean rascal!

1047
01:55:32,006 --> 01:55:33,037
You want my heart, eh?

1048
01:55:36,178 --> 01:55:40,895
You've burned my
life to embers!

1049
01:55:41,358 --> 01:55:44,381
Swept away all my desires like
a blade of grass in the wind!

1050
01:55:45,043 --> 01:55:50,495
But today all the veils drawn
on my life are removed.

1051
01:55:51,093 --> 01:55:54,874
Everybody has come to
know who and what I am!

1052
01:55:55,715 --> 01:55:59,674
I just wanted to start anew.
Forget the past.

1053
01:56:00,826 --> 01:56:06,729
Forget, eh?
You lowly rascal!

1054
01:56:07,952 --> 01:56:13,025
You want to mar the purity of a
woman with your dirty motives!

1055
01:56:13,688 --> 01:56:17,090
But there's still my decision!

1056
01:56:19,251 --> 01:56:23,103
I'm going to brand your
cunning eyes with this fire!

1057
01:56:25,161 --> 01:56:28,562
These eyes must have
ruined countless girls.

1058
01:56:28,775 --> 01:56:31,240
Today I'll close
these eyes forever!

1059
01:56:35,972 --> 01:56:37,323
Have you gone mad?

1060
01:57:01,002 --> 01:57:05,067
- What happened?
- Nothing. Kailash was here.

1061
01:57:05,173 --> 01:57:07,532
Him? He dared to do this?

1062
01:57:07,607 --> 01:57:09,480
- I'll phone the police.
- No!

1063
01:57:10,492 --> 01:57:13,585
- Don't make it public, please.
- Madam! Madam!

1064
01:57:13,655 --> 01:57:16,015
He woke up screaming, and
not quieting either.

1065
01:57:16,854 --> 01:57:18,549
My darling!

1066
01:57:25,927 --> 01:57:27,943
Go to sleep now.
Don't cry.

1067
01:57:28,014 --> 01:57:30,514
No, my darling...
don't cry.

1068
01:57:36,948 --> 01:57:39,792
Don't cry, Pappu.
Please don't.

1069
01:59:22,629 --> 01:59:26,137
I knew you'd try to go.

1070
01:59:27,252 --> 01:59:34,471
But I'm not taking anything.

1071
01:59:52,177 --> 01:59:55,650
The one whose memory
you're taking with you...

1072
01:59:55,898 --> 01:59:58,363
when he asks about you,
What will I tell him?

1073
02:00:00,417 --> 02:00:03,996
When the baby cries for you;
when my wife will want to know.

1074
02:00:05,075 --> 02:00:07,955
When people will ask why and where
our daughter-in-law has gone?

1075
02:00:08,726 --> 02:00:15,708
- What shall I say?
- Tell them, the real one is dead.

1076
02:00:16,547 --> 02:00:20,328
And the impostor ran off
when the truth was revealed.

1077
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:23,981
But they won't believe it.
They'll say, we maligned you...

1078
02:00:24,057 --> 02:00:28,537
to save our reputation.
We made up a lie!

1079
02:00:29,444 --> 02:00:33,119
Then what shall I do?
I can't bear it anymore.

1080
02:00:33,616 --> 02:00:38,334
- I want to die!
- You died that day...

1081
02:00:38,588 --> 02:00:43,934
- ...when you came here as Poonam.
- But that farce is over now.

1082
02:00:44,637 --> 02:00:48,383
The farce may be over,
but your life isn't!

1083
02:00:49,469 --> 02:00:52,527
What's there to live for now?

1084
02:00:53,501 --> 02:00:58,147
Everything. It's the same child
who needs a mother's love.

1085
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:03,372
Same mother-in-law, who is on
a pilgrimage having accepted you.

1086
02:01:03,931 --> 02:01:09,276
And the same old me, who
to save his family prestige...

1087
02:01:09,354 --> 02:01:13,620
-... stand before you,
imploring. - Father!

1088
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:19,355
Don't try to give a
rebirth to Madhavi today.

1089
02:01:21,452 --> 02:01:24,675
You came as Poonam.
So be Poonam.

1090
02:01:25,727 --> 02:01:28,192
Father, you've forgiven me?

1091
02:01:29,412 --> 02:01:30,728
Get up, my dear.

1092
02:01:32,401 --> 02:01:35,281
I won't go anywhere now!

1093
02:01:41,063 --> 02:01:44,086
I thought you'd change
your luck on Holi day.

1094
02:01:44,436 --> 02:01:47,210
But you came,
with your face burnt?

1095
02:01:49,408 --> 02:01:51,388
My wounds will heal.

1096
02:01:52,225 --> 02:01:56,873
But my heart will be mended
when I turn her desires to ashes!

1097
02:01:57,196 --> 02:02:00,908
Every jilted lover says this!

1098
02:02:02,899 --> 02:02:07,797
Had I not told you about Madhavi,
you wouldn't be so upset today.

1099
02:02:08,289 --> 02:02:10,754
No. In fact you've
done me a favor.

1100
02:02:11,975 --> 02:02:18,852
You don't know my plans.
I'm dying for that day...

1101
02:02:18,929 --> 02:02:23,161
...when the ashes of her
hopes make you a bride!

1102
02:02:23,867 --> 02:02:29,427
- Will that day ever come?
- Yes! I know how to turn tables.

1103
02:02:30,369 --> 02:02:33,487
This game of yours may
prove to be a burden to me!

1104
02:02:34,542 --> 02:02:36,522
I'm pregnant!

1105
02:02:36,733 --> 02:02:38,286
- What!
- Yes.

1106
02:02:38,889 --> 02:02:40,477
- No!
- It's true!

1107
02:02:44,035 --> 02:02:47,153
This one truth can
undo all our plans.

1108
02:02:47,373 --> 02:02:49,246
All our dreams
will be finished!

1109
02:02:51,267 --> 02:02:56,235
We belong to each other, but
we don't need a child now.

1110
02:02:57,179 --> 02:03:01,281
We must consider your
figure, youth and beauty...

1111
02:03:01,352 --> 02:03:05,382
- ...till I grab that wealth!
- Why don't you understand?

1112
02:03:05,593 --> 02:03:10,146
You want kids, right?
When the time comes, you will.

1113
02:03:10,705 --> 02:03:15,186
But not now.
Everything will be fine.

1114
02:03:21,485 --> 02:03:23,594
- You'll be happy to know...
- I know!

1115
02:03:25,517 --> 02:03:29,026
I'm going to be a mother.
But I don't want to be one.

1116
02:03:29,656 --> 02:03:30,687
Why not?

1117
02:03:30,769 --> 02:03:33,756
You may not be knowing,
but I'm a dancer.

1118
02:03:34,767 --> 02:03:38,692
if you were so fond of your
profession, why did you marry?

1119
02:03:39,184 --> 02:03:43,488
Life has its own compulsions.
You'll have to help me.

1120
02:03:44,018 --> 02:03:48,842
- I'll pay you whatever you say.
- What! You'll pay me?

1121
02:03:49,754 --> 02:03:55,800
You've come to the wrong place.
My job is to give life, not kill!

1122
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:58,892
- You may go.
- But...

1123
02:03:58,968 --> 02:04:00,592
I said you may go!

1124
02:04:09,644 --> 02:04:11,173
- What happened?
- He refused.

1125
02:04:11,244 --> 02:04:13,389
- But did you...?
- I tried.

1126
02:04:13,781 --> 02:04:16,354
But he refused to go against
his principles for money.

1127
02:04:21,605 --> 02:04:24,724
Don't fret so.
I'll manage everything.

1128
02:04:25,952 --> 02:04:30,078
You go on home.
I'll go elsewhere and come.

1129
02:04:37,357 --> 02:04:41,803
- Greetings, uncle.
- Come in. I was awaiting you.

1130
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:44,995
Why did you send for me?
You're keeping well, I hope.

1131
02:04:45,807 --> 02:04:49,315
Old age is a disease in itself.
Who knows about tomorrow?

1132
02:04:50,187 --> 02:04:54,148
That's why I want to carry out
one of my responsibilities.

1133
02:04:55,473 --> 02:04:58,497
- Which responsibility?
- My daughter-in-law.

1134
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:02,489
I often wonder what will
happen to her after me?

1135
02:05:02,845 --> 02:05:04,303
Don't say that.

1136
02:05:04,723 --> 02:05:08,754
You're keeping well and
we're no strangers to you.

1137
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:14,838
I wanted to hear the same
from you. Isn't it possible, son...

1138
02:05:14,911 --> 02:05:18,942
...that some decent boy
may accept her hand in marriage?

1139
02:05:19,188 --> 02:05:23,218
You wish to get her
married again?

1140
02:05:23,986 --> 02:05:28,362
Yes. When I think of her,
my heart is overwhelmed.

1141
02:05:29,271 --> 02:05:31,807
God has been so unfair to her.

1142
02:05:32,714 --> 02:05:37,054
- God widowed her in her prime.
- May I say something, uncle?

1143
02:05:38,799 --> 02:05:43,731
If a young man unknowingly puts
red powder in a widow's hair...

1144
02:05:43,806 --> 02:05:49,438
... and if that girl has accepted,
then can they both marry?

1145
02:05:50,135 --> 02:05:53,430
Why not? If both are willing,
of course they can wed.

1146
02:05:54,342 --> 02:05:56,594
Well then, that boy is me.

1147
02:05:57,611 --> 02:06:00,076
And the girl is Poonam!

1148
02:06:03,592 --> 02:06:06,021
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, uncle.

1149
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:12,030
I'll consider myself lucky, if you
give her hand to me in marriage.

1150
02:06:12,493 --> 02:06:18,255
What can make me more happy?
Send a telegram to Vishnu today.

1151
02:06:18,613 --> 02:06:21,803
I can't wait any longer.
Go, son go.

1152
02:06:40,728 --> 02:06:43,609
- Poonam...
- You?

1153
02:06:44,171 --> 02:06:45,201
Where were you?

1154
02:06:45,875 --> 02:06:50,628
I was watching that falling kite.
Where will it go? What will happen?

1155
02:06:51,472 --> 02:06:54,591
What can happen? Someone will
come forward and take care of it.

1156
02:06:55,298 --> 02:07:00,989
Who knows? Gusts of the wind
and branches may tear it to pieces.

1157
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:04,159
Never! Look!

1158
02:07:04,687 --> 02:07:08,990
The gardener's son has claimed it.
Now he'll retie it.

1159
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,709
Fly it in the open sky.
It's his now.

1160
02:07:13,623 --> 02:07:15,460
He'll never let
it be cut again.

1161
02:07:16,961 --> 02:07:21,715
- Even then, it'll be a felled kite.
- So what? Nothing wrong with it.

1162
02:07:22,002 --> 02:07:26,128
It is no less. She'll fly
again on a new string.

1163
02:07:26,558 --> 02:07:30,482
- With a new bondage.
- Who'll bind with her?

1164
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:35,795
I will! Like that one, I'll also
tie my kite with a new string.

1165
02:07:36,747 --> 02:07:37,777
Your kite?

1166
02:07:42,135 --> 02:07:44,186
You! Yes, dear.

1167
02:07:44,952 --> 02:07:47,489
I wish to make you mine
and give you a new life.

1168
02:07:51,489 --> 02:07:53,540
I've opened my heart to uncle.

1169
02:07:54,688 --> 02:07:59,337
He has asked me to wire my father.
Everything will be fixed then.

1170
02:08:00,565 --> 02:08:02,781
Uncle has accepted our love.

1171
02:08:03,764 --> 02:08:05,981
- Really?
- Really!

1172
02:08:07,832 --> 02:08:12,136
No! You must be mad!
Firstly, she's a widow.

1173
02:08:12,214 --> 02:08:16,518
Then she has a son.
Why are you doing this to me?

1174
02:08:17,047 --> 02:08:19,122
Are you mad?

1175
02:08:19,516 --> 02:08:23,297
Without weighing, and valuing,
you're discarding such a divine girl?

1176
02:08:23,375 --> 02:08:27,406
You keep her. Pray to her.
Why are you...

1177
02:08:29,565 --> 02:08:33,039
Come, my dear.
This is Kamal's father.

1178
02:08:34,745 --> 02:08:37,413
My dearest friend.
Means more than a brother.

1179
02:08:39,162 --> 02:08:43,288
- Bless you.
- He doesn't take tea...

1180
02:08:43,369 --> 02:08:47,257
- ...but hogs sweet-meats!
- I'll just get some.

1181
02:08:52,063 --> 02:08:56,058
Well? Got startled seeing such
a lovely and decent girl?

1182
02:08:56,860 --> 02:09:01,306
It's not that.
I think I know her.

1183
02:09:01,903 --> 02:09:05,507
- I've seen her somewhere.
- You're right.

1184
02:09:06,284 --> 02:09:09,402
She's not my daughter-in-law.
She's your keepsake.

1185
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:13,684
What! - Yes.
My daughter-in-law is dead.

1186
02:09:14,526 --> 02:09:17,370
She's your friend's
niece, Madhavi.

1187
02:09:19,671 --> 02:09:21,746
But she had run away
from the marriage-pandal.

1188
02:09:22,627 --> 02:09:25,721
She has paid more than
enough for that one folly.

1189
02:09:26,209 --> 02:09:29,504
Here's the letter, she
had written to Kamal.

1190
02:09:30,277 --> 02:09:35,695
After reading it you'll know.
She's as pure as the Holy water...

1191
02:09:35,771 --> 02:09:37,609
...and serene
as the moonlight.

1192
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:44,111
We haven't done many virtuous deeds.
Today we have a chance.

1193
02:09:44,742 --> 02:09:47,931
Unite two separated souls and
earn a blessing from God.

1194
02:09:49,714 --> 02:09:53,816
- Does Kamal know this?
- No, and he must never know it.

1195
02:09:54,444 --> 02:09:57,040
It's better this secret
remains a secret.

1196
02:10:00,724 --> 02:10:02,312
Come, my dear.

1197
02:10:05,346 --> 02:10:07,880
Here's your favorite sweet.

1198
02:10:08,439 --> 02:10:12,582
- Come on, open your mouth.
- You'll have to eat too, friend.

1199
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:33,106
- That's what I've got for you!
- How you scared me!

1200
02:10:33,705 --> 02:10:39,713
I'm scared too for now.
That day she had thrown me out.

1201
02:10:40,099 --> 02:10:44,471
- Suppose she sees
me with you? - Dear sir...

1202
02:10:44,548 --> 02:10:47,935
- That fear will soon go now.
- How come?

1203
02:10:48,406 --> 02:10:52,707
She's getting married
to Master Kamal. - What?

1204
02:10:53,201 --> 02:10:56,803
I've heard it too.
It was fixed just today.

1205
02:10:57,580 --> 02:11:03,031
Oh? Anyway...
Look what I've got you.

1206
02:11:03,697 --> 02:11:06,884
How lovely?
Is it for me?

1207
02:11:07,347 --> 02:11:11,056
Like it?
Give me a hug then.

1208
02:11:11,411 --> 02:11:14,485
And see what all I bring.

1209
02:11:16,208 --> 02:11:19,265
- What a nice girl.
- What are you doing, sir?

1210
02:11:20,379 --> 02:11:23,709
Hide here, sir.

1211
02:11:25,869 --> 02:11:28,156
What are you doing?
Isn't the milk ready as yet?

1212
02:11:28,753 --> 02:11:32,391
- Just cooling it. I've put sugar.
- Give it to me.

1213
02:11:38,763 --> 02:11:41,465
Please go now.
My heart's hammering.

1214
02:11:42,308 --> 02:11:46,537
Okay. But remember...
keep quiet about it.

1215
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:54,702
- Why was that man here?
- What man?

1216
02:11:54,923 --> 02:11:58,359
Liar! Whom were you talking to?
Why was he here?

1217
02:11:58,677 --> 02:12:00,619
I don't know.
He came and went.

1218
02:12:10,493 --> 02:12:13,751
My wife has wired that she's
coming in the morning.

1219
02:12:15,046 --> 02:12:18,446
And I've asked Kamal
to pick her up at the station.

1220
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:22,862
- Have your milk.
- Later. Come and sit.

1221
02:12:23,943 --> 02:12:25,294
I've to tell you something.

1222
02:12:28,877 --> 02:12:33,772
I've written my will and bequeathed
everything in the kid's name.

1223
02:12:34,542 --> 02:12:38,287
- Good that you did.
- And you're his trustee.

1224
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:40,588
- Me?
- Yes.

1225
02:12:41,979 --> 02:12:46,080
And as per this will,
till he's 20 years old...

1226
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:51,351
... all this estate, and its
responsibility, is with you.

1227
02:12:53,074 --> 02:12:57,695
Why just 20 years?
It's my life-long responsibility.

1228
02:12:58,392 --> 02:13:01,686
I know. But then
I think this too.

1229
02:13:02,797 --> 02:13:06,577
One day you'll get married
and go to your own home.

1230
02:13:07,767 --> 02:13:10,503
My divine daughter
will go away from us.

1231
02:13:12,528 --> 02:13:15,335
- How will we cope then?
- Father...

1232
02:13:16,108 --> 02:13:20,515
New ties need not
break one's old ties.

1233
02:13:21,286 --> 02:13:25,871
That's okay. But you'll have new
joys of a new life before you.

1234
02:13:26,811 --> 02:13:31,041
Those joys will not make you
forget your Munna, will they?

1235
02:13:31,677 --> 02:13:35,219
How can you say that?
Munna is mine!

1236
02:13:35,778 --> 02:13:37,401
And he'll always remain mine!

1237
02:13:39,497 --> 02:13:42,483
I was hoping you'd say that.

1238
02:13:44,258 --> 02:13:48,903
Today I'll sleep
very peacefully.

1239
02:13:50,375 --> 02:13:52,449
Give me the milk now.

1240
02:14:28,637 --> 02:14:29,667
Father...

1241
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:34,359
Father...

1242
02:14:50,846 --> 02:14:53,618
- What is it, Ma'am?
- Nothing.

1243
02:15:04,886 --> 02:15:07,101
Doctor, father is very ill.

1244
02:15:11,628 --> 02:15:15,029
I'm lnspector Tiwari.
Are you Mrs. Poonam?

1245
02:15:15,415 --> 02:15:20,310
I mean Shekhar's wife.
I was a sub-lnspector earlier.

1246
02:15:21,150 --> 02:15:25,249
I've just come here from Lucknow.
Where's Diwanji?

1247
02:15:25,424 --> 02:15:28,481
- He's sleeping.
- Never mind.

1248
02:15:29,074 --> 02:15:31,088
It's urgent work,
so I'll wait.

1249
02:15:31,611 --> 02:15:32,997
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1250
02:15:35,086 --> 02:15:36,578
Why hide from you?

1251
02:15:37,657 --> 02:15:40,500
Somebody has tried to tarnish
this family's reputation.

1252
02:15:41,029 --> 02:15:43,103
- Who?
- It's a woman.

1253
02:15:43,566 --> 02:15:46,517
She claims you're not the
daughter-in-law, but she is!

1254
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:50,133
- No! That's a lie.
- You're right.

1255
02:15:50,482 --> 02:15:52,556
But we've to
listen to everybody.

1256
02:15:52,776 --> 02:15:55,026
You'll have to come to
the Police Station.

1257
02:15:56,598 --> 02:15:58,150
- But...
- Never mind.

1258
02:15:58,509 --> 02:16:00,204
When Diwanji wakes, tell him.

1259
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:06,426
What's happened to him?
I didn't get to speak to you.

1260
02:16:06,886 --> 02:16:09,030
- How is he?
- Actually, doctor...

1261
02:16:09,909 --> 02:16:13,583
- lnspector! You, and here?
- I had come to meet him.

1262
02:16:13,662 --> 02:16:16,197
- Where is he?
- In his room. Come along.

1263
02:16:35,661 --> 02:16:38,647
Father! Oh Father!

1264
02:16:41,708 --> 02:16:42,738
Go out please.

1265
02:16:50,535 --> 02:16:52,230
You said he was sleeping.

1266
02:16:54,323 --> 02:16:58,387
Tell everybody not
to touch the body.

1267
02:17:02,004 --> 02:17:05,855
Please come
out of the room.

1268
02:17:14,759 --> 02:17:16,701
You'll have to come to
the Police Station with me.

1269
02:17:18,339 --> 02:17:20,696
I'll have to take your
statement on this issue too.

1270
02:17:21,745 --> 02:17:25,216
- After some time may be?
- You'll have to come now.

1271
02:17:26,713 --> 02:17:27,744
Come, my dear.

1272
02:17:31,474 --> 02:17:33,489
Till the body is not sent
for the post-mortem...

1273
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:37,411
...stand outside the room.
And let nobody enter it.

1274
02:17:38,112 --> 02:17:39,143
Come, let's go.

1275
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:45,850
Let's go, my dear.

1276
02:17:51,736 --> 02:17:52,766
Sit, please.

1277
02:17:55,454 --> 02:17:58,511
Don't be scared.
Go and give your statement.

1278
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,109
I'll wait here till then.
Now go on.

1279
02:18:19,932 --> 02:18:23,571
- That jeep. Everything's okay?
- What's the matter?

1280
02:18:25,739 --> 02:18:26,770
Go in. I'll tell you.

1281
02:18:36,068 --> 02:18:39,186
- Why are you crying?
- Madam...

1282
02:18:39,302 --> 02:18:42,254
Why don't you say something?
Why is this constable here?

1283
02:18:42,919 --> 02:18:44,578
Where have they taken Poonam?

1284
02:18:45,074 --> 02:18:47,149
- Where's the baby?
- What is it?

1285
02:18:49,143 --> 02:18:52,890
- Last night, Shekhar's father...
- What happened to him?

1286
02:18:53,073 --> 02:18:56,749
- He has left us forever!
- No! No!

1287
02:18:57,559 --> 02:19:00,369
- You can't go in!
- Get aside! Oh no!

1288
02:19:15,625 --> 02:19:20,214
- It's a lie! I'm Poonam.
- She's telling the truth.

1289
02:19:20,589 --> 02:19:23,778
Come sir. We have
a complicated matter here.

1290
02:19:24,345 --> 02:19:28,685
She says she's the real Poonam,
and not this one here.

1291
02:19:29,491 --> 02:19:34,246
She's lying! I know her well.
She's a cabaret-dancer.

1292
02:19:34,847 --> 02:19:36,958
And such a cheap woman can
never be from a decent family.

1293
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:43,017
I've already stated that
I used to dance on stage.

1294
02:19:44,062 --> 02:19:47,809
And that's why his father had
broken his ties with him.

1295
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:51,184
Sure he had broken his ties,
but that doesn't mean...

1296
02:19:51,261 --> 02:19:55,601
...any cheap woman can
claim to be his son's wife.

1297
02:19:55,782 --> 02:20:00,952
This is a plot. I'm Poonam.
Munna's mother.

1298
02:20:03,219 --> 02:20:04,250
I'm Kailash.

1299
02:20:06,279 --> 02:20:09,195
I always said bad deeds
always give bad results.

1300
02:20:09,549 --> 02:20:11,422
Law caught up with you
didn't it, Madhavi?

1301
02:20:12,643 --> 02:20:17,883
Yes sir. That's her real name.
She may be Poonam to you.

1302
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:21,126
But to me she was Madhavi
and will always be so.

1303
02:20:22,867 --> 02:20:25,891
I think it my duty to reveal
the truth in the presence of Law.

1304
02:20:26,970 --> 02:20:30,480
- Truth?
- The truth is...

1305
02:20:30,553 --> 02:20:33,433
...she's not Diwanji's son's
wife but my own wife!

1306
02:20:33,613 --> 02:20:38,581
Liar! Schemer! Rascal!
I've nothing to do with him.

1307
02:20:38,794 --> 02:20:41,782
You scum! Aren't you ashamed
to malign a decent lady thus?

1308
02:20:41,854 --> 02:20:43,692
This is a police-station.

1309
02:20:45,158 --> 02:20:47,209
How can I tolerate
her being insulted?

1310
02:20:47,731 --> 02:20:50,435
If he's telling the truth...

1311
02:20:50,687 --> 02:20:54,363
...then why didn't he tell
Diwanji when he was alive?

1312
02:20:55,625 --> 02:20:59,301
You can argue in the court.
Let us get on with our job.

1313
02:21:00,233 --> 02:21:03,866
- Carry on, sir.
- As I was saying...

1314
02:21:03,941 --> 02:21:09,343
we both were traveling together
and she and her child were with us.

1315
02:21:09,414 --> 02:21:13,073
- He's lying!
- Please keep quiet! Go on.

1316
02:21:14,091 --> 02:21:18,360
She told her tragic tale to her.
They became friendly.

1317
02:21:18,925 --> 02:21:23,478
Then we had an accident, and
we both and her kid survived.

1318
02:21:23,724 --> 02:21:27,328
I tried to find this lady,
but I didn't find her.

1319
02:21:28,314 --> 02:21:32,690
That very night my wife look
her child and ran away.

1320
02:21:33,044 --> 02:21:36,755
No, sir.
Don't believe him.

1321
02:21:37,565 --> 02:21:40,683
One has to believe the truth.

1322
02:21:41,007 --> 02:21:44,861
I don't want anything.
Just give me my baby.

1323
02:21:45,146 --> 02:21:49,379
Patience. Inspector will
return your child to you.

1324
02:21:50,153 --> 02:21:53,792
When I came here, my doubt
was proved to be correct.

1325
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:59,777
Madhavi was impersonating Poonam
and eying the money. I told her...

1326
02:21:59,856 --> 02:22:04,018
I reasoned with her, but
she didn't listen. Actually...

1327
02:22:04,098 --> 02:22:06,422
... that's what we were
fighting over that day, Kamal.

1328
02:22:06,532 --> 02:22:11,986
His every word is a lie!
He's taking some old revenge!

1329
02:22:12,722 --> 02:22:15,318
These two are trapping me!

1330
02:22:15,401 --> 02:22:16,894
Then what is the truth?

1331
02:22:21,382 --> 02:22:28,674
The truth is that, the real
daughter-in-law of that house...

1332
02:22:29,728 --> 02:22:30,759
...is dead!

1333
02:22:58,117 --> 02:23:00,097
Now this case is even
more complicated.

1334
02:23:00,969 --> 02:23:07,668
Diwanji died, not of a
heart attack, but poisoning!

1335
02:23:11,471 --> 02:23:15,668
My wife can impersonate
Poonam for money...

1336
02:23:15,748 --> 02:23:20,053
... but not kill!
No, sir. It's a lie.

1337
02:23:20,130 --> 02:23:23,876
Excuse me, but with present
circumstances, she'll have to stay.

1338
02:23:35,222 --> 02:23:36,253
Come.

1339
02:24:00,539 --> 02:24:05,613
Murderess! What do you want?
What farce you want to do now?

1340
02:24:06,764 --> 02:24:10,724
I'm innocent...
I'm innocent, I say.

1341
02:24:11,319 --> 02:24:16,394
Go away! You made me a widow.
You ruined my home.

1342
02:24:16,848 --> 02:24:21,223
- Go away! Go away!
- Be calm, please.

1343
02:24:22,413 --> 02:24:24,036
Come, let's go.

1344
02:24:44,347 --> 02:24:47,679
I thought your act was over.
Why are you here now?

1345
02:24:50,016 --> 02:24:53,454
The house which sheltered you,
you broke that very house?

1346
02:24:53,702 --> 02:24:58,113
Don't say that.
He was like a father to me.

1347
02:24:58,674 --> 02:25:01,793
- Please believe me!
- Believe?

1348
02:25:02,569 --> 02:25:08,296
And you?
No. Not any more.

1349
02:25:09,698 --> 02:25:14,073
I thought you were a Goddess.
But you let me down.

1350
02:25:15,088 --> 02:25:17,554
You hid the truth, and
played with my emotions.

1351
02:25:18,218 --> 02:25:22,664
Why? Answer me!
What was the need?

1352
02:25:25,765 --> 02:25:31,077
I know I've fallen in your eyes.
Whatever I tell you...

1353
02:25:31,155 --> 02:25:33,407
...you won't believe it.

1354
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:44,253
I've never asked anything from you.
But today, I ask just this...

1355
02:25:44,508 --> 02:25:49,298
if you can, just wipe the
stigma that I'm branded with!

1356
02:26:10,581 --> 02:26:14,506
Take it easy now.
Just be quiet.

1357
02:26:21,153 --> 02:26:22,183
Who are you?

1358
02:26:24,595 --> 02:26:27,096
Your real daughter-in-law.
Munna's mother.

1359
02:26:27,169 --> 02:26:33,525
Shut up! I've no daughter-in-law.
I hate that word! Now get lost!

1360
02:26:33,602 --> 02:26:36,518
Calm down.
Let's go in.

1361
02:26:38,497 --> 02:26:42,078
- Why are you here?
- For the love of my son.

1362
02:26:42,148 --> 02:26:47,081
Where was your love till now?
Did uncle's death suddenly evoke it?

1363
02:26:48,999 --> 02:26:52,473
She too must have some motive.
Throw her out, I say!

1364
02:26:53,972 --> 02:26:56,023
Hear that?
Now get out.

1365
02:26:57,380 --> 02:26:59,455
Okay, I'll go away.

1366
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:12,127
- This woman. Why was she here?
- She is the one...

1367
02:27:12,202 --> 02:27:13,791
...who claimed to be the
real daughter-in-law!

1368
02:27:13,872 --> 02:27:14,903
This woman?

1369
02:27:16,724 --> 02:27:22,142
She's a loose woman. She came for
an abortion, but I threw her out!

1370
02:27:23,505 --> 02:27:26,621
Such a woman can never be
a daughter-in-law of this house!

1371
02:27:26,835 --> 02:27:31,803
You think rightly. For I know,
Shekhar's real wife is dead.

1372
02:27:32,086 --> 02:27:36,082
Then why did Madhavi fool us
by taking Poonam's place?

1373
02:27:37,476 --> 02:27:40,808
To keep a promise given to her
friend and to atone her mistake...

1374
02:27:40,884 --> 02:27:44,322
... she committed, unknowingly.

1375
02:27:46,031 --> 02:27:48,177
What mistake?
What atonement?

1376
02:27:50,308 --> 02:27:54,125
She's the same girl
you were to marry.

1377
02:27:55,490 --> 02:27:59,237
- What are you saying, father?
- Your uncle told me everything.

1378
02:27:59,663 --> 02:28:01,809
- And that Kailash...
- All lies!

1379
02:28:02,931 --> 02:28:04,804
She's not involved with anyone.

1380
02:28:05,262 --> 02:28:08,356
She's pure.
And bright like a star.

1381
02:28:09,052 --> 02:28:14,720
How strange! You knew it all.
But why did not she tell me?

1382
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:19,793
She did! In her letter.
Here, read it.

1383
02:28:21,536 --> 02:28:27,298
It fell in your uncle's hands.
He thought you'd hate her...

1384
02:28:27,378 --> 02:28:31,860
... so he hid it. He, who
would've been the happiest...

1385
02:28:31,934 --> 02:28:35,573
... uniting you both,
has gone to his Maker.

1386
02:28:36,664 --> 02:28:40,481
And this poor girl
is accused for it.

1387
02:28:43,722 --> 02:28:46,082
How I wish I had got
this letter earlier!

1388
02:28:48,078 --> 02:28:50,438
Give the bottle, Pappu.

1389
02:28:52,217 --> 02:28:53,247
What is it?

1390
02:28:53,573 --> 02:28:56,905
He has a broken bottle,
and he's not parting with it.

1391
02:28:57,189 --> 02:28:59,857
Come here pet.
Let's see...

1392
02:29:06,231 --> 02:29:12,101
How's it here? I hadn't prescribed it.
And it can be fatal too.

1393
02:29:13,186 --> 02:29:16,825
Is it possible that this
caused uncle's death?

1394
02:29:17,707 --> 02:29:20,766
- Where did you find this?
- Outside the kitchen's window.

1395
02:29:24,349 --> 02:29:25,380
Coming sir.

1396
02:29:25,949 --> 02:29:28,688
Last night, who gave
uncle his milk?

1397
02:29:30,356 --> 02:29:32,752
- I mean who had made it?
- I sir.

1398
02:29:33,069 --> 02:29:35,180
- Had anybody else come?
- No, sir.

1399
02:29:35,434 --> 02:29:38,138
Liar! Hadn't that man come?

1400
02:29:38,354 --> 02:29:39,848
- Kailash?
- Yes, sir.

1401
02:29:42,910 --> 02:29:44,534
- Was Kailash here?
- No...

1402
02:29:44,614 --> 02:29:46,310
- You're lying!
- No, sir.

1403
02:29:46,388 --> 02:29:49,791
- You're lying!
- Yes, he was here.

1404
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:54,001
He gave me earrings. And went away.
I know nothing else.

1405
02:29:54,186 --> 02:29:56,474
I'll come to know the
rest myself!

1406
02:30:04,792 --> 02:30:05,823
You!

1407
02:30:10,982 --> 02:30:14,136
Won't you say anything?
Or even talk to me?

1408
02:30:15,712 --> 02:30:20,229
Won't you ask why I'm here?
I got your letter!

1409
02:30:23,849 --> 02:30:29,232
The truth came to light.
I've come to promise you...

1410
02:30:29,484 --> 02:30:31,879
...that somehow I'm going
to erase that stigma on you.

1411
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:38,383
It's too late now.
I've nothing to live for now.

1412
02:30:39,186 --> 02:30:42,304
I'm a liar; A branded-woman,
I murderess!

1413
02:30:43,185 --> 02:30:48,710
I can't bear it anymore.
I just want to die!

1414
02:30:49,966 --> 02:30:54,448
You never lived for yourself before
anyway. You lived for others.

1415
02:30:55,217 --> 02:31:00,457
Now you'll have to live
for yourself. Just yourself!

1416
02:31:09,544 --> 02:31:11,346
What do you think
will be the outcome?

1417
02:31:12,326 --> 02:31:16,558
Looks like we'll have all
the wealth at our feet soon.

1418
02:31:23,003 --> 02:31:24,033
You!

1419
02:31:27,384 --> 02:31:30,716
- Why have you sneaked in here?
- To meet Kailash.

1420
02:31:31,801 --> 02:31:35,382
- But I don't live with her.
- When did I say that?

1421
02:31:35,696 --> 02:31:40,664
Anyway. I've some urgent news.
Madhavi has confessed her crime.

1422
02:31:41,363 --> 02:31:43,723
- Why did she do that?
- To save someone.

1423
02:31:43,798 --> 02:31:46,857
- Who? - She didn't
say, but I know.

1424
02:31:46,928 --> 02:31:48,871
- Who? - He who
impregnated you!

1425
02:31:49,397 --> 02:31:51,543
Don't shout!
I have proof.

1426
02:31:57,673 --> 02:32:00,447
Look! The photograph of
the father of the child.

1427
02:32:03,550 --> 02:32:06,360
You're accusing me and
want to spoil my reputation.

1428
02:32:06,645 --> 02:32:08,447
I've never seen this
person in my life!

1429
02:32:08,628 --> 02:32:09,943
Strange!

1430
02:32:10,192 --> 02:32:13,215
You've never seen your husband,
Diwanji's son, in your life?

1431
02:32:13,914 --> 02:32:17,839
This is Poonam's husband.
Diwanji's son, Shekhar!

1432
02:32:17,947 --> 02:32:19,121
What?
- Yes!

1433
02:32:19,269 --> 02:32:23,750
This proves that you've
no relation with that family!

1434
02:32:24,102 --> 02:32:27,256
If you do have any relation,
it's with Kailash here.

1435
02:32:29,527 --> 02:32:31,602
You know too much!

1436
02:32:32,449 --> 02:32:36,124
- Your intention isn't good.
- Of course it isn't.

1437
02:32:36,691 --> 02:32:39,228
- But our aim is the same.
- What aim?

1438
02:32:39,856 --> 02:32:44,266
Diwanji's wealth! For which
you took her help to procure...

1439
02:32:44,341 --> 02:32:47,400
... and I, I used Madhavi!
- You mean...

1440
02:32:47,681 --> 02:32:52,684
The meaning is clear. Shekhar
was my friend and I was trusted.

1441
02:32:52,897 --> 02:32:56,086
When I went to collect Poonam
and her child, she was dead!

1442
02:32:56,792 --> 02:32:59,328
Then I met a destitute
girl, Madhavi.

1443
02:33:00,026 --> 02:33:04,258
I made her aware of parental
love and the life of the kid.

1444
02:33:04,824 --> 02:33:08,120
I put fear in her and under
that pressure, she agreed.

1445
02:33:08,614 --> 02:33:12,124
And the family accepted her
as their son's wife. Then...

1446
02:33:12,197 --> 02:33:16,607
...I began to woo her.
She needed love and support...

1447
02:33:16,682 --> 02:33:20,050
...and I, Diwanji's wealth!
- I see.

1448
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:25,306
I know you're sensible. But whatever
you've done, has undone my plans.

1449
02:33:25,689 --> 02:33:29,293
And I'll never keep quiet
while you enjoy all the luxury.

1450
02:33:29,585 --> 02:33:33,747
- What do you want?
- I'll keep everything to myself.

1451
02:33:34,001 --> 02:33:37,297
- But on one condition.
- What?

1452
02:33:37,583 --> 02:33:42,480
50 percent of Diwanji's wealth.
Which is worth minimum 2 million!

1453
02:33:43,425 --> 02:33:45,405
2 million?
- Yes!

1454
02:33:45,546 --> 02:33:48,535
If I hint, that you're
the real Poonam...

1455
02:33:48,606 --> 02:33:52,353
... then Diwanji's wife will accept
you, and all the wealth will be yours!

1456
02:33:53,544 --> 02:33:56,532
Agree? Think it over.
I'll come again tomorrow.

1457
02:33:57,405 --> 02:34:00,357
- I agree.
- Let's shake on it then.

1458
02:34:03,246 --> 02:34:05,915
- Let's celebrate on this.
- I'll get it.

1459
02:34:08,741 --> 02:34:12,038
- Who could it be at this time?
- You both go in. I'll see.

1460
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:28,520
- But you...
- God heard me. I'm innocent.

1461
02:34:29,398 --> 02:34:31,449
But you had admitted
to the crime.

1462
02:34:31,554 --> 02:34:33,142
Yes. Only because...

1463
02:34:33,397 --> 02:34:38,294
... I didn't want to live with this
stigma, but they got the killer.

1464
02:34:38,787 --> 02:34:42,627
- And they acquitted me.
- Killer? Which killer?

1465
02:34:45,638 --> 02:34:49,182
The maid! She confessed that
she had poisoned the milk.

1466
02:34:50,054 --> 02:34:54,679
And she dragged you into it too.
Said you gave her the bottle.

1467
02:34:54,749 --> 02:34:58,353
- That's absurd! A lie!
- May this all be a lie, but...

1468
02:34:58,435 --> 02:35:05,170
...I don't want you to get into
trouble. I have nobody but you.

1469
02:35:05,842 --> 02:35:12,127
Before the police come here,
let's run away. Come on...

1470
02:35:12,207 --> 02:35:17,140
- Take your hands off him!
- So! You're still around, eh?

1471
02:35:17,736 --> 02:35:22,490
You think you'll take him away from
me by scaring and threatening him?

1472
02:35:24,726 --> 02:35:28,887
By claiming to be the real Poonam,
you've deprived me of everything!

1473
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:33,968
- Today I've come to claim my right.
- You hated him till yesterday.

1474
02:35:34,324 --> 02:35:38,106
- And now you talk of right
and love? - And why not?

1475
02:35:38,461 --> 02:35:42,730
He has stated to the police,
that we are husband and wife.

1476
02:35:42,913 --> 02:35:45,865
He said that for my sake.

1477
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:50,693
He can't marry anyone. He's mine.
The father of my expected baby!

1478
02:35:56,371 --> 02:36:01,932
We wanted to hear this from you.
It's not so easy to fool the law.

1479
02:36:06,421 --> 02:36:08,472
You're under arrest
for murdering Diwanji...

1480
02:36:08,543 --> 02:36:14,234
... and for plotting to swallow
his wealth! You too, Madam.

1481
02:36:16,993 --> 02:36:20,147
What's all this?
I'm innocent. I know nothing.

1482
02:36:20,818 --> 02:36:24,199
He's right. He knows nothing.
But for his information...

1483
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:29,362
... I've taped his, and his
mistress's statement.

1484
02:36:29,442 --> 02:36:33,747
If you wish, shall I play it
so that he comes to know too?

1485
02:36:36,467 --> 02:36:39,585
The game is over.
Take them both away!

1486
02:36:45,370 --> 02:36:47,350
We caught a dangerous
criminal today, thanks to you.

1487
02:36:47,977 --> 02:36:50,265
And an innocent woman's
dignity was restored.

1488
02:36:52,081 --> 02:36:55,378
I don't have the words
to thank you. - What for?

1489
02:36:56,323 --> 02:36:59,239
The obligation you've done
by removing the stigma on me...

1490
02:36:59,314 --> 02:37:05,741
-..is something I'll never forget.
- It's was no obligation, but duty.

1491
02:37:05,887 --> 02:37:09,005
Sorry, but she'll
have to come with me.

1492
02:37:09,747 --> 02:37:13,351
But tomorrow you can bail
her out. Come, madam.

1493
02:37:24,631 --> 02:37:27,725
- Come in.
- As per your word...

1494
02:37:27,795 --> 02:37:29,039
But she's released.

1495
02:37:30,264 --> 02:37:32,339
- I've come to take her.
- But she has gone.

1496
02:37:34,055 --> 02:37:35,892
- Where?
- I don't know that...

1497
02:37:35,967 --> 02:37:37,875
but she left this
letter for you.

1498
02:37:43,652 --> 02:37:46,984
My shadow has always
eclipsed your life.

1499
02:37:47,965 --> 02:37:52,913
So I'm going away.
Please forgive me, if you can.

1500
02:38:38,424 --> 02:38:41,412
Where are you going?
I've come to take you home.

1501
02:38:42,215 --> 02:38:47,005
Home? Whose home?
Which home?

1502
02:38:47,883 --> 02:38:51,392
The same house where you found
shelter and peace of mind.

1503
02:38:51,986 --> 02:38:55,010
Where you dreamt of
Munna's future.

1504
02:38:55,707 --> 02:38:59,288
Where uncle had decided
to give you a new life.

1505
02:38:59,914 --> 02:39:03,661
No, don't say that.
Oh please don't.

1506
02:39:03,949 --> 02:39:09,059
Yes, the same home where aunt's
broken heart is begging for mercy.

1507
02:39:09,304 --> 02:39:14,378
A home which was your in-laws'
home, but now, your own.

1508
02:39:14,764 --> 02:39:20,112
No! That's impossible.
It cannot be...

1509
02:39:27,283 --> 02:39:32,975
<i>Break every
norm and mores...</i>

1510
02:39:33,056 --> 02:39:38,296
<i>come to me,
draped in my love.</i>

1511
02:39:38,599 --> 02:39:44,044
<i>Or else, I'll leave
this very world.</i>

1512
02:39:44,336 --> 02:39:49,948
<i>Where your memories
torment me...</i>

1513
02:39:50,283 --> 02:39:55,622
<i>I'd not like to
spend a moment.</i>

1514
02:39:55,950 --> 02:40:01,598
<i>The place where
you do not dwell...</i>

1515
02:40:01,759 --> 02:40:07,264
<i>I'd never set
foot, my love.</i>

1516
02:40:12,388 --> 02:40:17,388
