189
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,784
Good pressure play by United.

190
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,320
Varun I'm clear, Varun!

191
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,347
No.. no.. no.. no.. NO!
Varun panics and shoots...

192
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,018
No man! What the hell was that?
-Misses the shot!

193
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,726
Have you lost it? Do you not
know how to play? What is wrong with you?

194
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,198
Final score, 60-61 in favour
of United Public School.

195
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,338
We'll get them next time!

196
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,517
Mihir...

197
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,449
Relax man, dude... We'll show
them next time!

198
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,751
Like hell next time man!

199
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,553
I was open!

200
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,193
I had a clear shot.

201
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,430
Do you not know how to play?

202
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,322
Dude, calm down.

203
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,125
What's done is done. Chuck it.

204
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,237
The defence was on you,
I had the shot Mihir.

205
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,763
Yes, you always have the shot,
right?

206
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,673
Mihir, you are not the only one
in this team all right!

207
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,109
I don't know which World you
live in!

208
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,113
Everything has to be about you
always! Right?

209
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,842
Stop it Mihir!

210
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,919
This is not just about today...
He's always...

211
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,044
What?

212
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,725
Mihir relax man! It's okay!

213
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:53,992
Chill.

214
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,394
It's a daily thing with him man!

215
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,171
<i>Oye Gaurav!</i>

216
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,038
What just happened?

217
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,850
Lover's quarrel?

218
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,854
Dude, were you guys pain or
pleasure?

219
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,445
How do you intend on performing
the song?

220
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,650
Why are you so worried?

221
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,624
It's only one song!
We will be fine!

222
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,717
We will be screwed.

223
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,493
Anyway, listen...

224
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,388
Zoravvafis girlfriend plays the
keyboard right?

225
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,858
Who? Riya?
-Yeah!

226
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,532
Should we call her?

227
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,625
But she's in the 12th grade!

228
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,398
So what? We'll convince her...

229
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,563
Zorawar is going to beat all of
you up!

230
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,171
Oh forget it!

231
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,143
Dude...

232
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,676
Tanvi plays the drums man!

233
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,804
You too?

234
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,941
Look there... look who's
standing next to her!

235
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,651
You just... let it be!

236
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,124
What happened?

237
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,137
Pankaj...

238
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,145
Pankaj, please see who it is.

239
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,583
Why do I have to do everything?

240
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,093
Where's Babloo?

241
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,629
How do I know where he is?

242
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,424
How about a hello?

243
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,329
Hi Dad!

244
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,764
Hello.
-Hi Handsome.

245
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,161
Shobha, did you order some
local child musicians?

246
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,966
Hi aunty!
-Hi

247
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,404
What are you doing with these
guys?

248
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,440
Don't ask!

249
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,102
Hello uncle.

250
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,269
Dad, this is Keith...

251
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,208
and this is Tanvi.

252
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,177
'Evening uncle.

253
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,737
Hi, come on in.
-Hello uncle

254
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,809
Babloo!

255
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,886
I don't where he vanishes to all
the time!

256
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,883
Oh careful yeah?

257
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:00,753
Sorry!

258
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,552
Gaurav amp!

259
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,255
Dude...

260
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,067
Are you going to play that?

261
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,798
Yeah... why?

262
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,769
Casting pearls before a swine!

263
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,970
What?
- What was that?

264
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,632
I don't know! Just slipped out
of my mouth!

265
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,937
Ananya.

266
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,805
Why don't you make yourself a
little useful and

267
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,443
Get us
something to eat?

268
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,538
No!

269
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,344
Please

270
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,815
Please!
-No man.

271
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,113
Ananya please?

272
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,251
Fine!

273
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,753
Oh if Gaurav asks then,

274
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,518
how can she refuse!

275
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,076
Right!

276
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:33,946
WOW!

277
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,642
That sounded am...

278
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,151
Amazing!

279
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:36,811
Thank you!

280
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,514
Have you guys thought about what
to do in the assembly?

281
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,547
How about we try something
original?

282
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,682
Our own?
-Woah! Woah!

283
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,226
Aren't we getting a little ahead
of ourselves?

284
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,387
No, why not?

285
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,554
We should at least give it a
shot!

286
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,394
Yeah, Gaurav, pen and paper?

287
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,960
Where do I find a pen and paper
in this jungle now?

288
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,505
Thank you
-Can you get a chair as well?

289
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,943
Right, so...

290
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,238
We can open with the guitar...

291
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,509
But...
Thanks

292
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,676
Before that, what should be the
theme?

293
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,050
Dude, run... she is crazy!

294
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,044
What?

295
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,986
Ah.. life!

296
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:12,646
Yeah!

297
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,519
Our life...

298
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,290
Ahan...

299
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,155
You know, how they do it in
'Rock on'

300
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,154
'Blue blue skies, wet wet
water'?

301
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,757
Very original!

302
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,389
Ah, Riya why don't you try
something.

303
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,433
Ok, so I was thinking...

304
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,970
We can do, like a 'G' 'G' 'B'
'B' 'A' progression.

305
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,674
Yeah?

306
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,769
One second...

307
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,010
Should we try something like
this?

308
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,482
<i>.6. M.A.</i>

309
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,845
Hey Play it properly!

310
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,689
Yeah, yes! Right.

311
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,724
.G.

312
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,853
Yeah, that sounds good.

313
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,122
On an 'A'
-First you hold it like this.

314
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,360
What's an 'A'?
-No, no, wait...

315
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,663
Wait. Guys!

316
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,610
What happened?

317
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,849
We had that game in the bag!

318
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,417
That's fine, but it Wasn't
Varun's fault alone...

319
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,193
Both of you were arguing like girls!

320
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,636
Why are you getting so worked
up?

321
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,072
What do you mean we were
arguing like GIRLS?

322
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,103
You keep talking nonsense.

323
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,537
Let it go, why are you
overreacting?

324
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,375
I'm not!

325
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,539
You are!

326
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,309
Let it go, it was just a game.

327
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,881
How does it matter?

328
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,420
It matters to me...
-Mihir.

329
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,702
The whole school was watching.

330
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,771
Chill man...

331
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,209
It Wasn't Varun's
fault alone!

332
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,171
It's a team game.

333
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,083
Why are you getting angry at
him?

334
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,679
I'll speak to him.

335
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,799
What are you doing guys?
Pass the ball properly.

336
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,631
Zorawar pass the ball cleanly.

337
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,601
I'm sorry man.

338
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,729
It's okay.

339
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,744
Oh come on, let it go. They boy
is admitting his mistake.

340
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,272
Mihir. Any problem?

341
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,813
No Sir.

342
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,439
<i>Then tighten your defiance.</i>

343
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,539
<i>Defiance!</i>

344
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,184
Seriously man. I mean it.
It was just misplaced anger.

345
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,557
It's fine, it happens.
-Zorawar go in, rebound!

346
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,822
What's going on?

347
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,226
Pass the ball.

348
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,730
No! Why are you playing solo?

349
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,290
Don't you know how to pass the ball?

350
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,002
Mihir, switch to offence, Varun,
defence.

351
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,061
Come on Zorawar, star-t again.

352
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,801
Yes Sir... Come on guys.

353
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,479
Wing, climb up and defence.
Spread your hands.

354
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,949
I said I'm sorry!

355
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,950
Dude, the whole school was
watching...

356
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,052
Whenever you feel like it, you
scream...

357
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,150
Whenever you calm down,
everything should be fine?

358
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,722
Is it a joke or what?

359
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,531
If you two are done with your
little love story...

360
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,032
should we get back to the game?
Yes?

361
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,802
All right fine! I'm sorry!
What do you want?

362
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,406
Do you want me to kiss you now?

363
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,345
What?

364
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,473
You've never given me a kiss!

365
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,246
Don't miss it Varun! Girls would
die for an opportunity like this.

366
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,543
Come here you! Let's me give you
a kiss!

367
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,915
Mihir! What's going on?

368
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,023
Sir... sorry... post...

369
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,117
Star-t becoming a little more
serious in life.

370
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,197
Zorawar, come here.

371
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,801
Boys, line up.

372
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,441
What's going on there?

373
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,375
Juniors, line up.

374
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,806
Sorry!

375
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,374
It's okay.

376
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,741
Go... Line up!

377
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,650
Girls have become more important
than the game for you!

378
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,423
The rest of you also better mend
your ways.

379
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,318
Junior team... Break off!

380
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,701
Bye sir!

381
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,243
Zorawar...

382
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,302
Yes Sir.

383
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,305
Stan concentrating on your
game!

384
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:06,883
Yes Sir.

385
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,144
Enough with the distractions...

386
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,151
Sorry sir.

387
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,414
Won't happen again.

388
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,081
Senior team...

389
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,753
Break off.

390
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,564
Dude, I'm supposed to play 'B' right now!
-What?

391
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,632
Why will I play 'A'?

392
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,633
What's going wrong?

393
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,600
Change the progression.

394
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,602
What nonsense man! I have such a
headache now!

395
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,366
Why don't we do, 'B minor'...

396
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,737
Then, 'G major'

397
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,208
And then 'A major'.

398
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,700
What happened?

399
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,205
Nothing!
-Thank you.

400
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,022
Come, I will give you guys an
idea.

401
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,755
Sing your song...

402
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,521
Dad please go away!

403
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,565
Uncle, Why are you torturing the
poor kids?

404
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,395
<i>Torture'?</i>

405
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,489
I'm trying to help them!

406
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,364
Yeah, so then why don't you only
come and play in school?

407
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,664
Yeah yeah! Why not?
-Sure...

408
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,170
Hello...

409
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,330
What are you guys playing?

410
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,732
They're trying to compose their
own song!

411
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,503
Wow! Rockstars!

412
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,004
With this thing?

413
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,306
Thank you!

414
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,545
Dad...

415
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,387
Come home tomorrow and take my
guitar...

416
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,080
Cool...

417
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,121
Okay, now leave Dad, please!

418
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,922
Come Uncle, let's go make
dinner.

419
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,325
Hey, let's go out.

420
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,158
What?

421
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,220
Kanika just texted...

422
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,527
Then how can you not go?!

423
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,532
Can we also come?
-Dad...

424
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,502
Maybe after a couple of years!

425
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,470
Come on Dad!

426
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,474
Dad, let them come!
What's the issue?

427
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,564
Please...

428
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,736
Please... please...

429
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,042
But he's your responsibility then.
-Okay!

430
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,376
(We are crazy)

431
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,939
Come you guy's also come.

432
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,143
No no, I'll just go home.

433
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,810
Why?
-it's getting late.

434
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,411
(We are crazy)

435
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,387
Let her be Uncle, she takes too
long!

436
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,480
ZorawarH

437
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,925
I'll just walk home.

438
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,701
Please... Please...

439
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,898
Please fasten your seatbelt.

440
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,496
Why?

441
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,040
Shut up and wear your seatbelt.

442
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,539
(Each road has two directions to
go to...)

443
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:20,082
(Still every traveller wants
to reach the same destination)

444
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,712
(When you are tired, the journey
ahead appears stationary...)

445
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,279
(Why are you so afraid?)

446
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,485
(This is all just a pad of
life!)

447
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,596
(From one mountaintop...)

448
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,599
(to another...)

449
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,637
(From the peak of our head...)

450
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,866
(Into the bottom of deep
valleys.)

451
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,832
(We are together...)

452
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,376
(We are crazy...)

453
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,207
(We are together!)

454
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,939
(We are together...)

455
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,345
(We are crazy...)

456
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,315
(We are crazy!)

457
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,949
(We are crazy...)

458
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,522
(We are crazy...)

459
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,421
(We are crazy!)

460
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,331
(On delhi road, the trick is to
walk arrogantly.)

461
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,603
(The steering wheel in one
hand...)

462
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,439
(A bottle in the other.)

463
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,739
(They want the hottest
girls...)

464
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,507
(As hot as Sunny Leone.)

465
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,673
(After every sentence they plug in...)

466
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,409
(Don't you know who my father is?)

467
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,350
(The music is on full volume...)

468
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,246
(They have a bar in the trunk
of their car!)

469
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,316
(They have informed their
fathers...)

470
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,361
(The cops have all been bribed!)

471
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,421
(They sleep peacefully in the
night...)

472
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,965
(They wear goggles in the
night...)

473
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,192
(They roam free on the roads...)

474
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,065
(Act like body guards to all the
girls...)

475
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,764
(The chill of the Delhi's winter
has gone to their heads...)

476
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,108
(Haven't achieved a single thing
in life, yet have a huge ego!)

477
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:57,806
(We don't pause and move like
the hands of a clock...)

478
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,010
(We flow like a wave!)

479
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,478
(Don't think we are innocent or
naive...)

480
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:09,856
(If need be... We are the
mascots of mischief.)

481
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:15,862
(This story that we voice...)

482
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,959
(In both it's glory...)

483
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,163
(... and it's destruction...)

484
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,168
(We are together...)

485
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,572
(We are crazy...)

486
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,507
(We are together!)

487
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,169
(We are crazy...)

488
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,737
(We are crazy...)

489
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,784
(We are crazy!)

490
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,946
(We are crazy...)

491
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,681
(We are crazy!)

492
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,120
(We are crazy...)

493
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,957
(We are crazy!)

494
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,530
(We are crazy...)

495
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,659
(We are crazy!)

496
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,764
Someone please get some roti...

497
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,368
This is... ah... nice...

498
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,174
Oh the food totally makes up for it!

499
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,078
Who do you keep texting again
and again?

500
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,379
Who else will he text?

501
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,507
Ananya!

502
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,519
That's right! You guys just
need an excuse to start this.

503
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,649
You guys are cute...
l-low'd you star-t dating'?

504
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,382
Oh!

505
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,822
He would like that!

506
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,490
Ya right! We are just friends!

507
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,118
Oh! So now... "we are just
friends!"

508
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,288
"Good" friends!

509
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,230
How about we talk about you and
Tanvi?

510
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,160
What?

511
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:24,961
Nice group!

512
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,093
I'll say!

513
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,266
Good friends right?

514
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,905
Then I'm sure you don't mind me
reading your messages?

515
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:31,906
Fine!

516
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:32,998
Let's say I like her...

517
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,242
Now what?

518
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,072
How do you tell if a girl likes you?

519
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,477
Yes! Mr. Expert...

520
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,570
Elaborate!

521
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,115
Well...

522
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,116
You know...

523
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,379
You come to know...

524
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,020
You feel awkward sometimes...

525
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,084
But when you close your eyes...

526
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,147
You see her!

527
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,759
It's kind of strange... but...

528
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,964
You feel like spending time
together...

529
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,732
Like you want to be with them.

530
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,530
You know... be with them all
the time!

531
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,232
And you would not like it...

532
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,805
If there is any other guy around her.

533
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,508
That was so gay!

534
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,776
No way man.
-I was asking about girls!

535
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:10,972
You know what...

536
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,141
All of us... each and every one
of us...

537
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,777
are simply put... victims of
desire.

538
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,512
Desire?
-Victims of what?

539
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,577
You know...

540
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,816
Sex... physical attraction...
reproduction?

541
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,687
What's wrong with her?
-Circle of life!

542
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,125
Oh nymphomaniac! There are kids
on this table!

543
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,194
Tell you what...

544
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,094
We could use a few more gay men
in India.

545
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,427
Gay men?

546
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,262
There is something known as
protection?

547
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,028
Guys...

548
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,763
But that's not real sex!

549
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,702
I give up... I give up...

550
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,165
Where have you guys taken this
conversation?

551
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,301
We were talking about Gaurav and
Ananya.

552
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,936
Oh you shut up and have some
carrots.

553
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,906
Go, eat a carrot.

554
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,443
Carrot!

555
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,107
So... did you like the dhaaba?

556
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,448
It was good, but I still want pasta.

557
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,318
All right, next time.
-Okay.

558
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,823
So, that was great man.

559
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,352
See you Varun.

560
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,156
All right romeos... good night.

561
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,627
Can I come and take the guitar now?

562
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,354
Gaurav, let it be. It's getting
late.

563
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,728
There's nothing wrong with your
guitar.

564
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,096
You've seen the condition of my
guitar...

565
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,796
Are you mad? His parents will
skin him alive.

566
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,462
Come, take it.

567
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:11,730
No, no, chuck it.

568
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,771
You want it right?
Come.

569
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,639
It will only take two minutes.

570
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,372
Okay wait, I'll also come.

571
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,382
Will you drop Tanvi home?
-Yeah.

572
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,208
Okay, guys, see you, good
night... bye... take care.

573
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,480
Bye
-Bye Tanvi.

574
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,885
Bye guys, see you.
-F'ut on your seat belt.

575
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:26,786
See you.

576
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,864
Is this the time to come home?

577
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,202
Dad, I told you I'll be late...
-Keep quiet!

578
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,464
Get inside.

579
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,198
Get inside, why are you standing
there?

580
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,105
Kids... It's late, you people
leave.

581
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,147
Yes uncle.

582
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,513
Dad...

583
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,079
There is no need to talk like
that in front of my friends.

584
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,227
You imbicile... get inside, come on.

585
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,659
You've become too big for your
boots.

586
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,058
Wow! Is he always like that?

587
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,326
Chuck it.

588
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,105
This shop has really good stuff.

589
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,375
Woah! There, that one there.

590
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,314
There?

591
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,716
Oh Dude!

592
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,918
This is beautiful.

593
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:33,853
No man, it's okay...

594
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:34,913
Guys, guys, guys...
-No, really?

595
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,583
There's one there... you have to
see it!

596
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:37,922
Where?
-Here...

597
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,495
Hey, I also want to see.

598
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,362
This one!

599
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,696
Ooh nice!
-Oh wow, that's a good choice.

600
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:44,698
I know, right?

601
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,133
Mihir, this one's better...
-This is better.

602
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,931
This is classy, but this is more
rockstar.

603
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:48,868
But, this is more rockstar.
- I know, right?

604
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,166
I like this one!
-Take this one.

605
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,603
He's going to love it.

606
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,506
Thanks.

607
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,146
Try a 'r"r1inor'.

608
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,715
No, no, 'B minor'.

609
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,186
Yeah...

610
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,921
(Your hand slipped out...)

611
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,693
(You left my side...)

612
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,463
(All your promises were a lie...)

613
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,996
(You gave me pain and pushed me away.)

614
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,706
Hello cook sir...

615
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,076
I could smell the food all the
way to my house.

616
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,443
You guys' had to come...

617
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,675
Why am I not surprised?

618
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,445
Now, if you invite and I don't
show up?

619
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,610
How's that possible?

620
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:38,752
Gaurav...

621
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,482
Oh, thanks man!

622
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,525
Sorry about the other night.

623
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,616
Don't be funny.

624
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,027
Enjoy.

625
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,062
Hello Uncle...
-Hey...

626
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,062
Why do you look so upset
Zorawar?

627
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,597
No, nothing,

628
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,897
He's sulking.

629
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,797
The basketball court thing?

630
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,736
What happened?
-What do you think?

631
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,236
Same F'.K. nonsense.

632
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,402
Chucked him out of the team.

633
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,807
"Disciplinary reasons"

634
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:05,347
Everyone knows what the
"disciplinary reasons" are.

635
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,009
Who told you people to go
parading around school?

636
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,915
Morn, it's not that.

637
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,051
When you are dating, it's
obvious...

638
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,450
You spend time together...

639
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,923
Go to the movies together...

640
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,252
Have dinner together...

641
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,517
Everyone does it.
-He has a point.

642
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,860
People do what they want to do.

643
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,666
I mean, would you rather be in
the know, or in the dark?

644
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,632
What is the point of all these
sex-ed classes...

645
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,672
When the attitude is so old
school.

646
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,036
Yeah, exactly!

647
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,803
Boys and girls have separate
lines...

648
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,502
Sit separately...

649
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,375
No boyfriends or girlfriends allowed.

650
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,813
If they don't want to mix boys
and girls...

651
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,850
Then what is the point of a
co-ed school?

652
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,214
It's not like that...

653
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,719
Stop exaggerating.

654
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,684
There is something known as
discipline.

655
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,451
What has discipline got to do
with it?

656
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,391
Their lives, their decisions.

657
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,291
Exactly! It's simple.

658
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,125
Anyway, let it be.

659
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,392
You got this right?
-Yeah!

660
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,168
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

661
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,007
Come... help me get refills.

662
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:05,973
I also want some.

663
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,906
Come.

664
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:10,906
Have you done anything yet?

665
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:11,946
About what?

666
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,478
He's your brother! He's probably
a coward like you!

667
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,975
Good one.

668
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,543
Okay, I have an idea... listen.

669
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,385
You and your ideas!

670
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,685
Well, you said so yourself...

671
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,125
He's my brother...
He has to have my style.

672
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,590
Rohan, listen...

673
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,889
In the assembly song, I think.
he should...

674
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,065
Good morning everyone.

675
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,768
Today's special assembly is
brought to you by 9th graders,

676
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,812
And a little bit of us, 12th
graders.

677
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,211
So, Kindly put your hands
together for Keith...

678
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,978
Gaurav... Rohan... Riya... and Tanvi.

679
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,182
Now all we have to do is tell
Ananya.

680
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,360
(Everyone takes the main road...)

681
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,455
(but we will go through the by
lanes.)

682
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:13,136
(Meet new people... discover new
colours.)

683
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:23,014
(The books we carry...
exhaust us.)

684
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:31,760
(Our minds are empty and
the school bags are heavy)

685
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:38,233
(Our minds are empty and
the school bags are heavy)

686
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,066
(We all are in one team...)

687
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,871
(But we are still
competing against each other.)

688
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,006
(No one has reached anywhere)

689
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:56,176
(But are returning from a place
unknown.)

690
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:05,523
(A loud horn honks in the
traffic of our cluttered minds)

691
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:14,102
(Our minds are empty and
the school bags are heavy)

692
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:21,337
(Our minds are empty and
the school bags are heavy)

693
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:43,360
(In big bold fonts
all the norms are written.)

694
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:50,064
(There is no colour, all of us
wear the same uniforms.)

695
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:56,169
(We flow slowly like a river...)

696
00:33:56,234 --> 00:34:03,448
(We adjust in situations
easily like the sunlight)

697
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,117
(But sometimes we
think to ourselves)

698
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,315
Ananya... I need to tell you
something.

699
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,783
Gaurav really likes you.
-(When will we grow up?)

700
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,451
What?

701
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,756
Yeah! Give it a thought.
-(When will we grow up?)

702
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,057
Wait a minute... what?
-(When will we grow up?)

703
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,065
(Amidst such chaos...)

704
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,330
(One must seek relief.)

705
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,701
(And when everything feels
lost...)

706
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,604
(One must find some hope.)

707
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:33,274
(The load on our shoulders mocks us...)

708
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:42,048
(Our minds are empty and the
school bags are heavy.)

709
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:50,798
(Our minds are empty and the
school bags are heavy.)

710
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:58,136
(Our minds are empty and the
school bags are heavy.)

711
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:05,941
(Our minds are empty and the
school bags are heavy.)

712
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,150
That was awesome!

713
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,588
It was the best performance ever.
-That was so good.

714
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,955
Dude... I loved the reactions.
-it was really good. Was crazy.

715
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,426
Did you see the crowds?
-Their reactions!

716
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,220
Yeah man. It was really good.
-They were... jumping up.

717
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,028
And not just that... the chord
improvisation on stage!

718
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:25,794
That was amazing!

719
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,891
I don't know
what I did in the middle... but...

720
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,440
Hi...

721
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,441
Hi.

722
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,006
Nice song.

723
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,010
So, you liked it?

724
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,386
Yeah...

725
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:46,844
No.

726
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,221
What?

727
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,551
Okay...uh...

728
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,821
Gaurav... What was that?

729
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,061
What?

730
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,092
Gaurav...

731
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,758
The... the song?

732
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,825
The... I thought...

733
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,598
I thought...
-You thought what?

734
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,726
I thought...

735
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,000
Thought what'?
-I... I thought, we were just...

736
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,369
I thought we were just... friends.

737
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,341
You... You like me?
-Yeah!

738
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,784
Gaurav this is all too sudden.
-For crying out loud Ananya!

739
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,588
I just need some time to think.

740
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,336
We saw above that the cell
has special components

741
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,171
called organelles.

742
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,669
L-low is <i>it...</i> l-low is a cell
organised.

743
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,077
If we study a cell under a
microscope...

744
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,271
What did she say?

745
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,707
Who is talking?

746
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,810
If we study a cell under a
microscope...

747
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:51,785
you would come across three
features in almost every cell.

748
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,018
Plasma membrane...

749
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,112
nucleus and cytoplasm...

750
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,353
Forget about it.
It was a bad idea.

751
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,492
And interactions of the
cell...

752
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,792
with its environment are...

753
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,033
possible due to these features.

754
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,796
Let us see how.

755
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,230
(Meet me after school?)
-5.2.1. Plasma membrane

756
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,501
or cell membrane.

757
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,272
This is the outermost covering
of the cell...

758
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,940
that separates the contents of
the cell...

759
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,574
from its external environment.

760
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,382
The plasma membrane allows or
permits the entry...

761
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:29,989
and exits of some materials in
and out of the cell.

762
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,757
It also prevents movement of
some other materials.

763
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,689
The cell membrane, therefore
is called...

764
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,532
A selectively permiable
membrane.

765
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,968
Okay class. For tomorrow, read
chapter five...

766
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,440
There's going to be a test.

767
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,841
I can't do this with you Gaurav.

768
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,045
I'm... I'm sorry...

769
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,790
Why are you apologising?

770
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,324
Because... because, you are my
best friend... and...

771
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,133
So what's your point?

772
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,232
The song.

773
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,344
I Wasn't asking you out.

774
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,880
Gaurav stop your nonsense.
Mihir's girlfriend...

775
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,542
Can't I sing two lines without
you making it a love song?

776
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,484
I...

777
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,247
Listen. I'll see you at
practice. Yes?

778
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,549
No. Wait. I need to...
-Okay.

779
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,588
No!

780
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:26,771
So?

781
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,677
I don't get it man.

782
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,641
I thought. there was something
there.

783
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,384
Look, I know there is.

784
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,726
Give her some time?

785
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,030
Even you know there is! Right?

786
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,298
Yeah!

787
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:56,466
Exactly! She is a little slow.
She will come around.

788
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:58,696
But she...

789
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,405
Forget it. I'm going home.

790
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,272
Practice?

791
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,742
Make some excuse to coach F'.K.

792
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,563
Brother...
-Oh Shit.

793
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,635
Oh Shit.

794
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,533
Dude...
-Gaurav

795
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,831
What are you doing?

796
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,364
Oh shit... Gaurav!

797
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,884
Gaurav...

798
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,819
Gaurav... Brother, please...
Listen to me.

799
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,384
Brother, I need to talk to you!
Please don't do this man.

800
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,858
Mihir!
-Gaurav, come out... Gaurav...

801
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,020
Speak to him!

802
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,119
You just...

803
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,230
Brother please, let me explain
myself.

804
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,733
I don't want to talk to you
right now.

805
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,326
Gaurav, hear us out!

806
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,665
Mihir, make him understand!

807
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,035
Brother, I need to
-Mihir just leave me alone!

808
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,539
Gaurav, you are over reacting

809
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,168
At least hear me out.
Give me a chance! Please!

810
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,982
Gaurav please...
Just speak to me once. Please.

811
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,149
Brother...

812
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,648
Brother I need to talk to you.
Please don't do this.

813
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,517
Hello... Hello...

814
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,526
Gaurav... you there?

815
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,497
Yeah.

816
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,557
You... is everything okay?

817
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,898
Do you have anything important
to say'?

818
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,936
Gaurav... brother... please!

819
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,097
Why are you getting so angry?
I just...

820
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,606
You think I care?

821
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,203
What's done is done. I'm sorry!

822
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,338
Take all the time you need!
I couldn't care less.

823
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:01,314
Gaurav...

824
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,409
Gaurav open the door!

825
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:08,920
Gaurav!

826
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,617
Mihir... relax.

827
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,222
What relax man?

828
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,194
He's a kid... he won't
understand!

829
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,198
Whatever will happen, we are in
this together!

830
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,595
It's not easy man.

831
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,594
Hello... Shobha...

832
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,664
Shobha...

833
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,428
Where were you roaming?

834
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,024
I Wasn't really roaming around...

835
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,165
I too have work sometimes.

836
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,670
Sometimes' is correct.

837
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,798
Where are the boys?

838
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,300
The young prince is asleep.

839
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,534
And what about his elder
brother?

840
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,637
Glad to be of service,
your Highness.

841
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:39,908
I'm impressed!

842
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,277
Come, give me a foot massage.

843
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,848
Yeah, right!
-I hope you're noticing this, Shobha...

844
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,716
You've really spoilt these two brats.

845
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:46,844
Now what do I say?

846
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,184
Like father, Like son.

847
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:48,881
Oh, shut up!

848
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,186
Where is your brother?

849
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,527
Go, call him. Dinner is ready.

850
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,392
Oh, Morn. He'll come on his own.

851
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,761
Get up Lazy Bones!
Go, call your brother.

852
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,123
Okay, Alright. I'm going.

853
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,691
You seem to be in a very good
mood.

854
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,134
Yes. Had a good meeting today.

855
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,865
I think I'll bag this project
for sure.

856
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,769
How nice!

857
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,551
Brother...

858
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,748
G...Gaurav

859
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,153
What?

860
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,253
<i>What do you want MMM?</i>

861
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,930
Mom's calling you for dinner.

862
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,629
Tell herl am not hungry.

863
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,174
Gaurav Please, don't create a scene.

864
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,609
Brother... why are you doing
this to me?

865
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,147
What am I doing Mihir?

866
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,351
Gaurav, please promise me...

867
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:27,321
You... you won't tell Mom and Dad.

868
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,022
For once at least hear me out!

869
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,857
Fine, Talk.

870
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,505
Look...

871
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,149
<i>Today...today...</i> What <i>you...</i>

872
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,846
Whatever you are... thinking...

873
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,924
There is nothing like that.

874
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,862
Mihir, I may be a kid but I am
not stupid.

875
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,792
Gaurav, it's a difficult
situation to be in...

876
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,428
What situation Mihir?

877
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,237
You and Varun?

878
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,302
You and Varun are supposed to be
friends...

879
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,741
Not in Bed.
-Gaurav...

880
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,343
Look, it is what is.

881
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,813
It's for easy for me either.

882
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,042
And what about me?

883
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,484
I looked up to you man.

884
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,519
Nothing has changed Gaurav.

885
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,751
Everything has changed Mihir

886
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:40,550
Look... Brother...

887
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,959
How do you know when you like a girl?

888
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,159
Don't talk about liking girls,
Mihir.

889
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,734
Stop trying to preach others.

890
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:51,772
<i>Brother...</i>

891
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,310
Gaurav...
-No, Mihir

892
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:58,638
You tell me...

893
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,173
How DO you know when you like a girl?

894
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,208
Maybe I'm not supposed to like
girls either...

895
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,344
Maybe this is the way its
supposed to be...

896
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,080
Right?

897
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,680
Gaurav, please understand man!

898
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,320
Understand what?

899
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,362
Nothing

900
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,402
Dinner is ready. Come...

901
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,065
Morn, I'm not hungry.

902
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:25,137
Why?

903
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:26,972
Morn, I am not hungry

904
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,065
Come on.

905
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,648
Gaurav, what happened yesterday?

906
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,287
What happened?

907
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,163
Are you all right?

908
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,127
What's the matter?

909
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,496
Gaurav...Tell us.

910
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:58,865
What?

911
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,034
Why are you shouting?
What's your problem?

912
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,678
Good morning, Ma'am.
-Good morning everybody.

913
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,346
Please settle.

914
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,909
Thank you Ma'am.

915
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,346
How are we today?

916
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,891
Fine, Ma'am.

917
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,155
So, who'd like to give me a
brief up about...

918
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,664
What we did yesterday?

919
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,462
Would anybody like to volunteer?

920
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,968
How about you Prapti?

921
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,793
Would you like to give me a
quick brief up...

922
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,099
About what we did yesterday?

923
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:31,935
Yes Ma'am.

924
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,771
Yesterday we studied about, what
is psychology...

925
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:35,508
Okay- --

926
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,111
And what are the...

927
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,374
Ummm...different branches of
psychology...

928
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,439
Just give me two brief points...

929
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,729
So, what's up?

930
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,500
Nothing. Not much.

931
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,144
I forgot to ask...

932
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,538
How was the song?

933
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,309
Hmmm, it was awesome.

934
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,578
You guys should have seen the
school's reaction.

935
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,813
Well, that's great. Good job, my
friend.

936
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,490
What happened?

937
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,385
It was okay.

938
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,427
I mean, they want us to play in
the fest.

939
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,656
Wow, that's a good thing, right?

940
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,095
But that's awesome.

941
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,362
So, the new guitar did the job?

942
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,830
Sure did!

943
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,136
How did Ananya like the
song?

944
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,168
How would I know?

945
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,477
Have you two had a fight or what?

946
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,309
What's going on here?

947
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:48,976
<i>Gaurav'?</i>

948
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,285
Can I have some water, please?

949
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,688
Gaurav!

950
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,225
Thanks.

951
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,206
What happened in school today?

952
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,140
The usual. Fun day.

953
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,341
What happened now?

954
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,216
No, Morn. I'm not hungry anymore.

955
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,875
What's happening?

956
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,215
Today you are not hungry...

957
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,017
The other day Gaurav Wasn't
eating dinner?

958
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,613
What's the matter?

959
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,623
Nothing Morn.

960
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,492
You've given too much leeway to
the kids.

961
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,463
It's okay. They're growing up.

962
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,328
You keep giving them leeway...

963
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,832
One day, they'll get out of
hand.

964
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,670
What happened?

965
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,439
Nothing.

966
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,810
Yeah. Very good.

967
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,883
What will you achieve by getting
angry?

968
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,180
I'll be fine.

969
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,026
Gaurav...

970
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,133
What's going on with you?

971
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,241
Okay. Fine. Alright

972
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,906
If you're upset, don't speak to
anybody.

973
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,183
Why can't you tell me?

974
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,519
What do I tell you?

975
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,251
There is some problem at home.

976
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,458
What happened? Are Uncle and
aunty getting a divorce?

977
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,927
No, Man.

978
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,524
I wish.

979
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,299
Then what is the issue?

980
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,594
Rohan. Leave it, man.
Just let it be.

981
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,774
Look, Ananya likes you

982
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,434
And how do you know that?

983
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:29,839
I'm telling you so.

984
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,243
Rohan, these things are all
irrelevant.

985
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,117
Let's call it a day.

986
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,681
My mind isn't working anymore.

987
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,984
We need to practice.
-Yes, we can continue right now.

988
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:44,184
Yeah, but...
-What is his deal.

989
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,057
Only God knows about him and
his deals.

990
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,110
Ananya...

991
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,851
Gaurav...Listen...

992
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,886
I'm really sorry about the way I
acted...

993
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,490
It was stupid. Extremely stupid.

994
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:23,892
The thing is...

995
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,925
I like you.

996
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,360
I really like you.

997
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,829
And I'm in.

998
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,834
Completely in.

999
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,371
So... let's make this happen?

1000
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,540
What do you say?

1001
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,379
Ananya...

1002
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,574
I like you.

1003
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,951
I like you a lot.

1004
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,451
But...

1005
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,056
I can't...

1006
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:33,824
Not...Not right now.

1007
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,577
What do you mean... you can't?

1008
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,752
There is just too much going on
right now...

1009
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:01,788
And I...

1010
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,558
I can't even tell you.

1011
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,294
And...

1012
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,868
I'm not sure about things.

1013
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,868
I myself can't understand what
is happening with me.

1014
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,416
Not sure of things...

1015
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,196
That makes... sense!

1016
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,892
<i>This is... Ul"I"ll"I"'ll"I"'l...</i>

1017
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,302
Awkward.

1018
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,207
I guess I'm going to leave!

1019
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,771
Ananya, Wait!

1020
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,677
(Someone close...)

1021
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,442
(you are to me.)

1022
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,212
(Someone, about whom little is
spoken...)

1023
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,022
(And little is hidden.)

1024
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:16,302
(You too, know the secret)

1025
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,830
(What this moment...)

1026
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:25,268
(is unravelling...)

1027
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:29,845
- Mihir, what will people say?
(That my head is yours...)

1028
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:34,752
- Oh, you guys are Gay.
How cute, like that's adorable.

1029
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,652
- Let's go out and celebrate!
(You belong to me...)

1030
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,522
- Varun, just shut up man.
(You belong to me...)

1031
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,893
I don't want my parents to walk
in on us.

1032
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,159
Walk in on you and Varun?

1033
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,027
Are you cheating on me?

1034
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:48,933
Find out what?

1035
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,528
(You belong to me...)

1036
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:55,599
Guys, Varun and me need to tell
you something.

1037
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,938
Mihir...

1038
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,172
Okay- --

1039
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,210
Till now, Me and Mihirwere a
couple...

1040
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,377
...but now he's with Varun.

1041
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,014
Zorawar. Dude, Shut up man.

1042
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,360
Dude, I am done with girls!

1043
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,903
They are beyond the scope of my
understanding!

1044
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,498
<i>Gaurav'?</i>

1045
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,976
So last night I take Tanvi
out for dinner, okay...

1046
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:33,036
But NO... Why would we go to
some fancy restaurant...

1047
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,892
Gaurav, all cool?

1048
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:49,196
(Your eyes, when they see you
in the mirror...)

1049
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:55,964
Me and Varun... We are sod
of... together.

1050
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,096
Dude, seriously man?

1051
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,465
Kanika, I'm not joking.

1052
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,838
No, no, no.. Kanika Listen to me

1053
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,935
(I have lost my way...)

1054
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,243
You are my best friend and...

1055
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,714
- Best friends, Mihir? That's it?

1056
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,310
That's all we are?

1057
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,516
- And you are gay? That's what
you are saying? You are gay?

1058
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,156
- Dude, was I just... an excuse
for you?

1059
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,293
Kanika no. Please understand...

1060
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,162
Understand what?

1061
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,799
Understand that the guy who I am
in love with is gay?

1062
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,428
(Give my eyes the permission)

1063
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,936
(Just for once, with a smile...)

1064
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:41,213
(Call me your own.)

1065
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,844
(To hear this from you...)

1066
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:49,583
(With bated breath...)

1067
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:54,459
(My entire World awaits.)

1068
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:59,029
(My head is completely yours.)

1069
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:10,604
Hey...

1070
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,043
Hi.

1071
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,422
Is Mihir at home?

1072
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:23,718
He's in his room.

1073
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,823
Are you okay?

1074
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:30,626
Why would I not be okay?

1075
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,365
Gaurav, I know it's very
difficult to digest but...

1076
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,765
Mihir is in his room.

1077
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:57,948
When did you find out?

1078
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,887
What?

1079
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,927
That I'm gay?

1080
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,732
Forget it. It's not important.

1081
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,836
Class 10th. CBSE tournament.

1082
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,236
That long?

1083
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,275
It's not a joke Kanika!

1084
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:19,405
I couldn't sleep at night.

1085
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,213
I just couldn't understand what
was going on.

1086
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,788
This one tournament...

1087
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:34,484
Finally, when I spoke with Varun
for the first time.

1088
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:41,490
For the first time I felt...
there is someone who gets me.

1089
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,135
How did you know that even he...

1090
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,369
I didn't

1091
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,356
How do you know that you like me?

1092
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,627
Can you explain it?

1093
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,366
Exactly.

1094
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,104
Kanika...

1095
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,342
I've realised one thing.

1096
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,718
If anyone ever finds out...

1097
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,787
Then my entire life I'll have to
hear things like...

1098
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,262
"Oh you poor thing, you are sick."

1099
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,632
"These things happen..."

1100
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,367
"It's a phase..."

1101
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:51,969
"Time will heal you."

1102
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,341
Everyone will just presume...

1103
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,243
That it's their birth right...

1104
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,215
To make me understand...
who I am!

1105
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,017
Come.. let's go out somewhere.

1106
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,156
No, I don't feel like it.

1107
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,487
Come on...

1108
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,288
Come.

1109
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:59,169
You don't have to live like this
Mihir.

1110
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,333
Who cares about what people
think?

1111
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,470
You have us!

1112
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,782
You have a support system.
We are there for you.

1113
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:16,047
Have you told your mom and dad?

1114
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,352
Have you spoken with Gaurav?

1115
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,294
He's a kid...

1116
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,765
What do I say to him?

1117
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,327
What do I say to mom and dad?

1118
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,899
You'll have to tell them sooner
or later!

1119
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:32,462
Why?

1120
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,906
Or else, they'll find out from
someone else!

1121
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,906
It's not that easy.

1122
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,779
It's easy to preach all this.

1123
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,647
It's a whole other thing when
you have to practice it yourself.

1124
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:53,958
At least try?

1125
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,497
So never?

1126
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,768
Dude...

1127
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,498
Jeez, sorry! Who's the girl
here?

1128
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,910
What happened?

1129
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,849
Why are you sitting here?

1130
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,248
Nothing.

1131
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:25,787
Tell me!

1132
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:28,824
I was just thinking about
something.

1133
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,056
What?

1134
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:37,567
Maybe... I should tell mom and
dad?

1135
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:43,001
You... Have you gone mad?

1136
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,975
I told you not to tell anyone!

1137
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,545
Then...

1138
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:58,557
Who... Who gave you this
brilliant idea?

1139
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:02,987
Mihir?

1140
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,730
Kanika.

1141
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:14,736
Kanika...

1142
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:16,975
Okay- --

1143
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,203
And when?

1144
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,144
Yesterday... She came home
yesterday evening.

1145
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,583
She came home...

1146
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,724
Awesome!

1147
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,462
Why don't you go ahead and take
her advice!

1148
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,628
I told you there is no need to
tell anyone.

1149
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,840
But why would you ever listen to me?

1150
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,045
Varun, she has a point man.

1151
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,447
Whatever Mihir.

1152
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,685
Do whatever you want.

1153
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,444
Varun...

1154
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,515
Varun...

1155
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,585
Varun...

1156
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:07,760
What happened?

1157
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,588
What kiss was she talking about?

1158
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,425
Kiss?

1159
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:16,036
That day, when you decided to
tell the whole world...

1160
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,638
It meant nothing Varun.

1161
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,135
I'm sure.

1162
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,764
Varun...

1163
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:23,971
I didn't do anything...

1164
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,572
She came and kissed me!
What was I supposed to do?

1165
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,444
Really? Then when were you
planning on telling me?

1166
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:32,510
It meant nothing!

1167
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:36,318
Did you kiss her back?

1168
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,216
No! Can we please drop it?

1169
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,458
Varun... man.. Varun...

1170
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,862
How... How long do you want to
live like this?

1171
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,594
Not my parents!

1172
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:51,266
Okay! They will never understand.

1173
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,901
At least try once! Who knows...?

1174
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,637
Look if you want to do it, go
ahead!

1175
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,239
Don't drag me into Kanika's
brilliant ideas.

1176
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,283
Varun...

1177
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,444
Fine?

1178
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,048
Varun...

1179
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,735
What do you mean fine?

1180
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,499
Have you lost your mind?

1181
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,573
I told you!

1182
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,075
Keep giving them leeway...

1183
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,048
They'll come back and
bite you.

1184
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,813
What do you mean bite you?

1185
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:43,719
I said I'm gay... not a... rabid
dog!

1186
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:44,883
Mihir!

1187
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:46,425
Shut up!

1188
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,992
If only you took some time
off from your work...

1189
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,732
Maybe Mihir Wouldn't be in this
condition today!

1190
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:01,365
If only you ever did some
work...

1191
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,774
Maybe I would have some spare
time in life!

1192
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,277
Yeah! It's all my fault.

1193
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,112
Silence that damn thing.

1194
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:12,313
All this is your friends'
influence.

1195
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,154
Running around like hooligans all day.
-Dad...

1196
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,185
All my friends are supportive.

1197
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:18,782
Unlike you, they don't pretend
to be liberal!

1198
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,383
How dare?
-F'ankaj!

1199
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,200
What is the point of yelling now?

1200
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,704
Imbicile! Thinks he can raise
his voice at me.

1201
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,662
Morn... Can I talk to you?

1202
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,435
Yeah son...

1203
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:11,805
Come.

1204
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,581
What happened?

1205
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,219
Morn, why is all this happening
morn?

1206
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,588
I don't know.

1207
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,856
<i>But. .. why MMM?</i>

1208
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,329
I'm... I'm 14!

1209
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,395
I'm supposed to think about
stuff like... My exams...

1210
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,631
My homework...

1211
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:42,438
Not... my brother being
attracted to guys!

1212
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,802
How does that even work?

1213
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,908
Calm down son.

1214
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,576
It's a phase.

1215
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,044
It'll pass.

1216
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,714
What phase morn?

1217
01:11:58,447 --> 01:11:59,983
He's my brother!

1218
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:03,352
I don't even know how to talk
to him anymore.

1219
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,000
You tell me...

1220
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:12,395
He keeps trying to talk to me.

1221
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,973
What do I say to him?

1222
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,371
Your brother is confused...

1223
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:22,343
He'll become okay.

1224
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,882
Gaurav...

1225
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,383
Go and sleep now.

1226
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,620
Good night.

1227
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,745
Shift...

1228
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:00,552
Shift...

1229
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:51,505
I told you so many times that
there is no need to tell anyone.

1230
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,114
What did mom dad say?

1231
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:06,880
What will they say?

1232
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:08,983
They pretend to be so open
minded!

1233
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:10,819
Fake-ass people.

1234
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,422
Mihir...

1235
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,993
It's not easy.

1236
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,599
They're your parents.

1237
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,530
Don't talk like that.

1238
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,469
Dude...

1239
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,440
What will we do now?

1240
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,646
Mihir...

1241
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:44,950
It'll work out.

1242
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,494
It always does.

1243
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,029
L-lrnmm...

1244
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,175
Gaurav...

1245
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,413
Do you want to talk?

1246
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,247
Forget it Mihir...

1247
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,918
How does it matter?

1248
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:27,828
Exactly!

1249
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,067
How does it matter?

1250
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:37,802
Who does he think he is?

1251
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,577
I keep trying to talk to him!

1252
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,042
I've had enough!

1253
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,418
My life... my choice!

1254
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,993
Hello Mrs. Aggan/val, how are
you?

1255
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,223
Hello Mrs. Joshi.

1256
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,058
Mr. Joshi...

1257
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,565
I hope you didn't have any
issues finding the house?

1258
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:01,760
No, no, Mr. Aggan/val, it was
okay.

1259
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:02,528
Oh okay.

1260
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:03,763
I thought maybe you don't
come this side very often.

1261
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,600
No I frequent this area a lot.

1262
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,804
How is work Mr. Agganlval?
-All well.

1263
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,811
It's a lovely house that you
have.

1264
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:14,711
Beautiful.

1265
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:16,680
Morn, dad, can I talk to you
please?

1266
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,843
Hello Mihir, how are you?

1267
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:19,908
Hello aunty.

1268
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,682
Mihir, go to your room.

1269
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,779
I'm not going anywhere!
What are you trying to prove?

1270
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,553
Mihir you are not that old yet,
go to your room.

1271
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,253
You guys are the limit.
You have no right!

1272
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,819
Mihir... get out!

1273
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,798
What happened Mr. Agganlval?
Is everything okay?

1274
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:34,995
Ah, any problem?

1275
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,231
You look upset...

1276
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:41,303
Do you want to tell them?

1277
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,877
Mr. Joshi... I don't want my son
to hang around with yours anymore.

1278
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,140
I don't understand Mr. Aggan/val,
hang around?

1279
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:49,408
Your son has spoilt my son.

1280
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,678
I don't understand... spoilt
your son?

1281
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,051
My son made your son gay?
What are you saying Mr. Agganlval?

1282
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,986
Your son is misleading our son.

1283
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:58,820
Mrs. Aggan/val, I beg your pardon.

1284
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,723
My son misleading your son?

1285
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,456
It is your son who is
misleading my son!

1286
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,828
He drives around in posh cars,
takes him to pariies...

1287
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:06,763
Exactly.

1288
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,529
More than your son, you are at
fault here.

1289
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,126
What are you saying Mr. Agganlval?

1290
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:11,262
At least think before you talk!

1291
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,431
I have given this a lot of thought.
-This had to happen!

1292
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:16,533
Your children roam around like
hooligans all day...

1293
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,608
Spoilt our poor boy as well.

1294
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:22,638
Mrs. Joshi... your son is no
saint in White clothes either!

1295
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,308
Sarita, come, get up.
Let's leave.

1296
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,317
I don't intend on staying here
and getting insulted anymore.

1297
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,719
Mr. Aggan/val, please do come to
our house for dinner sometime.

1298
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,790
We will show you how to treat guests.

1299
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,489
Why don't you also become like
your brother!

1300
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:39,027
He's your idol isn't he?

1301
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,101
Why are you yelling at him?

1302
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,298
If you have something to say
come and say it to me.

1303
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:45,799
What's Gaurav's fault in this?

1304
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:46,929
Why are you venting my anger on
him?

1305
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,441
The two of you think you are too
grown up!

1306
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,406
Whatever mom.

1307
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,548
Sorry. My.. ah... honest
mistake.

1308
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,422
Dude Gaurav, what are you doing man?

1309
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,085
Keith, relax man.

1310
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:09,888
Let's do it again.

1311
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,472
My bad, my bad.

1312
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,110
The competition is in a couple
of days...

1313
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:30,378
And all we seem to be practicing
are Sir Gaurav's issues.

1314
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,543
What is your problem?

1315
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:33,711
My problem? What's my problem?
Dude it's...

1316
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,289
Okay you guys, can we please do
it from the chorus again?

1317
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,168
They will search...

1318
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:03,667
The birds will search for a new
dawn...

1319
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,541
Gaurav... wait!

1320
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:58,697
Gaurav...

1321
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:01,531
He's gone mad!

1322
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,937
Why did you run off and come here?

1323
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,371
So, this is what's been messing
you up?

1324
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,655
Oh, wow!

1325
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,186
When did you find out?

1326
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,851
That day...

1327
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,591
The day of the assembly song.

1328
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,732
I walked in on Mihir...

1329
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,103
With... Varun.

1330
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,434
Walked in on them? Meaning?

1331
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,802
They were in the room.

1332
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,080
Doing what?

1333
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,443
Rohan, what do you want me to say?

1334
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:45,383
Why are you being so thick?

1335
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,355
Mihir likes Varun... like...

1336
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,856
You like Tanvi.

1337
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,294
Why didn't you tell us before?

1338
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,266
This isn't some kind of gossip!

1339
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,800
I'm telling you now.

1340
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:09,737
<i>OKBV-</i>

1341
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,102
Even if he does, you know...

1342
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,312
Like guys...

1343
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:17,083
Then, that's his personal
decision, right?

1344
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,511
Until when will you be upset
with him?

1345
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,611
Ananya, even I used to
think the same way.

1346
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,922
It's all cool, it doesn't matter.

1347
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,259
But, it's easy for people to say
it...

1348
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:32,356
But when it comes to yourself,
then shit gets real.

1349
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:43,943
Sorry.

1350
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,008
I just can't understand...

1351
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:50,079
Why didn't he simply come and
talk to me about it?

1352
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:06,525
It will be fine.

1353
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:08,665
It's okay.

1354
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:31,890
<i>Gaurav'?</i>

1355
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:38,691
<i>Gaurav'?</i>

1356
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:42,533
What are you searching for?

1357
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,310
Let's do this!

1358
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:12,123
Don't argue with me on this.

1359
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:13,928
But...Sir...Why?
-We are forfeiting the game.

1360
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,801
Sir... At least tell us why?
Sir...

1361
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,834
Dude, let's go... Please!

1362
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:23,835
Varun?

1363
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:26,503
What happened?

1364
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,657
(Come to me)

1365
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:45,061
(o Wanderer)

1366
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:48,693
(Come to me, O wanderer)

1367
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:51,738
You guys need to see the crowd
outside.

1368
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,669
-It is amazing!
(Come to me, Come to me)

1369
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,729
Really?

1370
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:56,906
Listen...
-Again, again.

1371
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,842
Listen, listen Rohan...Where's
Gaa..Where's Gaurav?

1372
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,412
He'll come. He's outside.

1373
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:01,609
(laughs) Gaaarav!

1374
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:02,909
All right Synergy.

1375
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,245
After that scintillating
performance...

1376
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,787
The band that all of you have
been waiting for!

1377
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:21,094
What up? What up Synergy?

1378
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:25,102
Today we have a story for you.

1379
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,306
In the morning, I woke up.

1380
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:31,501
Brushed and bathed.

1381
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,770
Went to school.

1382
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,483
At school, my teacher told me...

1383
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,148
How and what I should study.

1384
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:42,945
My coach told me...

1385
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,991
What and how to play.

1386
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:47,249
And in the evening...

1387
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,585
In the evening, the news told me...

1388
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,362
How and what I should be
thinking!

1389
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:04,243
Ever happened to you?

1390
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:07,377
Have you experienced it?

1391
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,776
(Have you really tried to find
yourself? )

1392
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:13,342
(Discovered who you really are?)

1393
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,051
(The entire World asks you...)

1394
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:20,218
(Asks you the same question.)

1395
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:24,259
(Amongst the noise of this
crowd...)

1396
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,391
(Pay attention to your own
voice.)

1397
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,364
(Among the multitude...)

1398
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:36,739
(Choose your own voice!)

1399
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,868
(We will speak up...)

1400
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:43,177
(Speak up to free ourselves.)

1401
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,810
(We will open the doors...)

1402
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,645
(Of the cage that curbs our
freedom.)

1403
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:52,949
(We will speak up)

1404
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,558
(Speak up to free ourselves)

1405
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,532
(We will open the doors...)

1406
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:03,899
(Of every cage that curbs
our freedom.)

1407
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,335
Mihir won't be allowed to play
today's game!

1408
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,541
Sir, how long is this going to
go on?

1409
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,948
I don't have an answer for your
question.

1410
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:17,773
Either we all play as one
team...

1411
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:18,943
or else, no one will play.

1412
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,358
(My answer...)

1413
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,957
(Where is my answer stuck?)

1414
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,121
(My answer...)

1415
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,926
(Why is my question...)

1416
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:35,229
(So difficult for you to
answer?)

1417
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,967
(A mature mind...)

1418
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:43,531
(Finally comes face to face with
innocent questions.)

1419
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:46,106
(Maybe, we don't really know...)

1420
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,942
(What is right or wrong...)

1421
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:49,777
(But, a half baked truth...)

1422
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:53,307
(Is not something that we will
accept.)

1423
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,853
(We will speak up...)

1424
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:59,188
(Speak up to free ourselves.)

1425
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,990
Excuse me ma'am, F'.K. Sir's
asking for you. (We will open the door...)

1426
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:07,124
(Of every cage that curbs
our freedom.)

1427
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,430
(We will speak up...)

1428
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:13,536
(Speak up to free ourselves.)

1429
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:15,307
Ma'am, times are changing now!

1430
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,376
And we must move ahead with
current times.

1431
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,276
My team will not play without
its Captain.

1432
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:22,042
The rest of the decision is yours!

1433
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:10,162
Encore... encore... encore...

1434
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:14,597
Once more... once more... once more...

1435
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:17,169
I'm Glad you guys enjoyed that
performance...

1436
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:20,229
Now let's wait for the judge's
results!

1437
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:22,933
Gaurav. That was...

1438
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:24,840
That was... that was amazing!

1439
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:28,106
With the whole... the crowd and
the... the whole place...

1440
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,375
<i>It was just...it was...</i>

1441
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:31,974
Holy Crap, Dude!

1442
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,452
Wow, Finally!
-I'm impressed.

1443
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:35,647
Thank You!
-Once more... Once more..

1444
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:38,990
What say g uyg?

1445
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,923
Mihir's been kicked out of the
team?

1446
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:41,960
What?

1447
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:44,389
Aaa... Mihir's been kicked out
of the team!

1448
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:46,864
Now that is more like the
energy we like to see.

1449
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:47,956
Oye, Gaurav. Let's go...

1450
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:51,629
Give it up one more time for
the band from Synergy.

1451
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:54,037
Yo, Yo Synergy!

1452
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:56,575
Are we having a good time?

1453
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,835
This one's for you!

1454
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:02,876
What will I achieve by playing
like this?

1455
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,475
My own brother isn't speaking to
<i>me...</i>

1456
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,550
My parents aren't talking to me
either...

1457
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,144
and look at Varun's condition.

1458
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:11,814
My so-called family.

1459
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,190
I have a question for all of
you.

1460
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:22,458
School is the time to figure
yourself out, right?

1461
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:24,968
To get to know yourself?

1462
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:27,702
But how do you when you like
someone?

1463
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:31,204
I think I've figured it out!

1464
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,137
What happened?

1465
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:35,045
Rohan you handle it.

1466
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:36,275
Where are you going now?

1467
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:43,487
(Yes, your hand slipped away...)

1468
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:46,388
(But you never left my side.)

1469
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:49,457
(It Wasn't a lie...)

1470
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:54,397
(Your promise was not a lie.)

1471
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,457
(You called me your friend...)

1472
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,434
(Yet you pushed me away...)

1473
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:01,599
(It was a painful time.)

1474
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:05,667
(All the fun times we had
together...)

1475
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:10,375
(Why did you let them all
fade away?)

1476
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:18,616
(They will search...)

1477
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:23,827
(The birds will search for a new
dawn.)

1478
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:26,465
(They will break...)

1479
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:31,869
(All the boundaries that
imprison them.)

1480
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,626
(They will search...)

1481
01:30:56,684 --> 01:31:01,429
(The birds will search for a new
dawn.)

1482
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:03,799
(They will break...)

1483
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:08,533
(All the boundaries that
imprison them.)

1484
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,507
(We will speak up...)

1485
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:15,071
(Speak up to free ourselves.)

1486
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,579
(We will open the doors...)

1487
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:22,914
(Of every cage that curbs
our freedom.)

1488
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,718
(We will speak up...)

1489
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,451
(Speak up to free ourselves.)

1490
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:32,596
(We will open the doors...)

1491
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:37,295
(Of every cage that curbs
our freedom.)

1492
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:39,429
(We will speak up...)

1493
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:44,536
(Speak up to free ourselves.)

1494
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:46,476
(We will open the doors...)

1495
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:51,813
(Of every cage that curbs our
freedom.)

1496
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:53,749
(We will speak up...)

1497
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:58,213
(Speak up to free ourselves.)

1498
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:01,117
(We will open the doors...)

1499
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:05,259
(Of every cage that curbs
our freedom.)

1500
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:08,599
(Yes, we will speak up.)

1501
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:13,263
(Give us our freedom!)

1502
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,238
(We will open the doors...)

1503
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:17,867
(Of every cage that curbs our
freedom.)

1504
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:24,315
(Yes we will open them!)

1505
