00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
Greetings

2
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,560
As a boy I was always interested in the abnormal.

3
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,360
I liked to imagine

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,360
the history of each scar and imperfection.

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
When touching the scars

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,720
I felt that there was a story

7
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,720
beneath every wound.

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,080
A small abnormality to me

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
was something to contemplate.

10
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,800
What is this?

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
Why are you all here?

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Calm down, calm down...

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,960
This is my territory

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,120
If we settle,

15
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,840
it means no more Yakuza
trespassing into this area.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,360
They say this is their turf.

17
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,000
Then it's our fault.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,480
You are idiots!

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,840
What the hell did you say?

20
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,800
Are you a fool??

21
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,120
Stop!  Don't do it!

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Don't move!

23
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,120
That's enough.

24
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,200
The money on the table is payment

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,560
for my men's results.

26
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,080
We won't invade your turf again.

27
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,960
You have received a warning.

28
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Be careful where you do business.

29
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,240
I don't want to run into you again.

30
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
I am interested in childhood traumas.

31
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,920
How much left?

32
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960
Twenty thousand.

33
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,960
This is only the interest.
When will you pay every cent?

34
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,160
Please sir, don't do this!

35
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,840
I don't have the money

36
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,000
to pay you now.

37
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,960
I'll find a way to pay all of it back.

38
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,960
So you're in love with him?

39
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
It will be very difficult if you choose

40
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,600
to do this again.

41
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,720
There won't be a next time

42
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,720
if I see you both together again.

43
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Remember what I said.

44
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
You should go back to Japan

45
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
and we won't see each other again

46
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I see.

47
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
"CHOCOLATE"

48
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,440
I've checked everything

49
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
and I think she has problems
with her brain development.

50
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,840
This doll is a reminder of my father.

51
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Look after it carefully.

52
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
Your daughter's condition is not that bad.

53
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,720
Zen's condition is stable

54
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
but she will need special care

55
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
so that she can be as normal
as possible.

56
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Some things will not come easily to her.

57
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,840
Although time has passed,
you should know,

58
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
there is a reason as to why
I let you go that day.

59
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
It is so difficult to look after our
daughter, but I am happy

60
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
because when I see her,
I see you.

61
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Zen is not like other kids.
She needs special care and attention.

62
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
My life is devoted to her.
I will always love you... Zin.

63
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,600
Zin and that Japanese are
contacting each other again.

64
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
What should we do?

65
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,200
Having fun playing by yourself?

66
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,680
Zen!

67
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Let's chat, have a seat.

68
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,440
You're Zen?  Japanese name

69
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,080
just like her father.

70
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
Can you speak Thai?

71
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
What do you want?

72
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,360
Leave her alone!

73
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Sit down!

74
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,960
You know what this is called?

75
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Hmmm?

76
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,920
Do you know?

77
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
I said leave her alone!

78
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
Let me tell you,

79
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,080
losing a toe can change

80
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,080
your way of life...

81
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,080
When you walk... when you run...

82
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,560
you're constantly reminded

83
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,960
of the past.

84
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I should have done this to you then.

85
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,360
so you wouldn't have to be reminded

86
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,120
of the pain

87
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,120
every day.

88
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Actually this place is quite convenient.

89
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
It can be a bit loud, but you'll get used to it.

90
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,720
Owww!!

91
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,680
It hurts!!

92
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you...

93
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,360
That was Zen performing

94
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,960
Thank you for the applause...

95
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Thank you for the encouragement...

96
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't be shy...

97
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,280
Check those pockets for coins...

98
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
Thank you...

99
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Thanks very much...

100
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,360
Any more Maam?

101
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you everybody

102
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,800
Thanks very much...

103
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,480
Any more coins?

104
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,560
Thank you...

105
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,080
Now for our second performance

106
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,440
Anybody want to test Zen's abilities?

107
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Think of it as helping out the kid.

108
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
It's not taking advantage of her,

109
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,840
come on.. this way a little bit..

110
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,840
I'll also give you a try...

111
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Zen?!?

112
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,680
Hey!!

113
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,320
That was a stupid thing to do!

114
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,800
What if her hand gets
chopped off?

115
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Which coward did this?

116
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, I thought she was really tough.

117
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,120
What else can she do?

118
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,480
Nothing...

119
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,960
It's OK, let's go...

120
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,360
It's OK, let's go...

121
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,600
Hey, hey hey, where are you going?

122
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Hey, hey hey, where are you going?

123
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,960
You're dead, fat man!

124
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Don't tell Zin about your leg, OK?

125
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,440
Are you OK?

126
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm OK.

127
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,240
Not everything can be
caught in your hands.

128
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,840
Not everything can be
caught in your hands.

129
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,240
Let's do this, if you cannot catch
it with your hands,

130
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,120
Let's do this, if you cannot catch
it with your hands,

131
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll yell...

132
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll yell...

133
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,440
They're all gone now... all gone.

134
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's do this.  Next time it's dangerous,
I will yell...  Flies!

135
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,680
Let's do this.  Next time it's dangerous,
I will yell...  Flies!

136
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,200
Let's do this.  Next time it's dangerous,
I will yell...  Flies!

137
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
OK.

138
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Flies!

139
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,600
Oops...

140
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
Zen?

141
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Did you understand any of that?
You're supposed to duck.

142
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Flies!

143
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,680
OK Zen, for real now, OK?

144
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,320
Moom!!

145
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
What are you doing?

146
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,480
Moom, you know she's not normal
like the other kids.

147
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
Why do you have her risk
doing stuff like that?

148
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,120
Come on, it's good practice for her.

149
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,960
This way she can protect herself

150
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,480
when she needs it.

151
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,720
And we want to make money...

152
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,600
I know you mean well,

153
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,560
but it's not much money.

154
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Well, it's enough to pay your doctor's bills.

155
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,320
The medicine you want

156
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,920
can have strong side effects

157
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,920
and they can be pretty bad.

158
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,120
I know.

159
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,120
But, you may be lucky
with minimal side effects.

160
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,960
Why don't you head on home now?

161
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,440
Let's go out

162
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,080
Hmmm...

163
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,200
Zen,

164
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
Mum will call tomorrow.

165
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Let's go out!

166
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,800
Brush your teeth after you snack too, OK?

167
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,560
OK?

168
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,560
OK.

169
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,720
Let's go out!

170
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,160
Let's go..

171
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,120
NO!!!

172
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Catch the ball.. It's for Zen...

173
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
Do you want to try?

174
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,720
Do it for Zen,

175
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,680
Come, give it a try,

176
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you...

177
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Thank you, very grateful..

178
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Thank you, thank you......

179
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Moom, why is Mum not coming with us?

180
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,680
Because we don't have enough money.

181
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,680
We need lots of money to pay
for medicine for auntie

182
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,960
We need lots of money to pay
for medicine for auntie

183
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,680
so when she's well,
she can be with us.

184
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,680
so when she's well,
she can be with us.

185
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,360
Why lots of money?

186
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Zen!  Look at this!

187
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Looks like a lot of people owe money
to auntie Zin.

188
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, Zen, I'm so sorry,

189
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,240
I forgot to tell you that
we cannot go out today.

190
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,480
But today is the day to go out.

191
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,600
I know.

192
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Today is the day to go out.

193
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,840
Go out today!  Go out today!

194
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,200
Zen...

195
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,680
Today!  Today!

196
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,800
Sorry.. sorry..

197
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Today!

198
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,560
Today!

199
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,800
Today!

200
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Zen!

201
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Don't be afraid of your mother!

202
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,440
Zen!  Please stop!

203
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Look at me, it's Mum!
It's OK!

204
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Hi, can you tell me where the owner is?

205
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,720
Let's leave your mother to rest.

206
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,720
OK?

207
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,440
You little bastards!

208
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,560
Who says I owe her money?

209
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,080
Why don't you go home
to your mummy!

210
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,960
Why don't you go home
to your mummy!

211
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,920
I'll be damned if I'm going to pay you a cent!

212
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,960
Idiot!

213
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
But you said you know her.

214
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,120
That doesn't mean I owe money
to everybody I know!

215
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,720
Get outta here!

216
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Hang on... she's sick!
Listen to me!

217
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,360
She needs money for a doctor!

218
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,240
Hey....

219
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Ouch!!

220
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,960
What a cold hearted fool.

221
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,080
How does auntie Zin know these people?

222
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,120
Bunch of criminals.

223
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,120
You know Zen,

224
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,000
these people owe your mum lots of money.

225
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,480
If we cannot get them to pay,

226
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,360
she will be in hospital for a long time.

227
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,960
We will try again later.

228
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,240
Mum in hospital?

229
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,800
It's a lot of money, Zen!

230
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Lots of money.

231
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Zen?  Hey?

232
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,920
Mum's money.  Mum's in hospital.

233
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,440
Give it to me now.

234
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
Give it to me now.

235
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Now!

236
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,960
Fast

237
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
Hey Zen!  Let's go!

238
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,600
Money!!

239
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,080
Need Mum's money!

240
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Let me go!  Let me go!

241
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,440
That kid is back asking for money again.

242
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Money.

243
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,800
Give me money!

244
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,720
Mhong, show her where the money is.

245
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,960
Why should I give you any money?

246
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Money!

247
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Give me money!

248
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
I'll take you to get the money.

249
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Get out!

250
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:02,560
Money.

251
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Mum's money.

252
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,920
Give me money...

253
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,680
Mum's money!

254
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
Mum is in hospital!

255
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
Need lots of money!

256
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,080
Let's just see how it goes today Zen.

257
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,360
If he seems nice, then we'll ask for money.

258
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,000
If he pays us back,

259
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
we can pay for all the medicine.

260
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,560
Excuse me...

261
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,320
What?

262
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,560
Who are you here to see?

263
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,920
We are here on behalf of Zin,

264
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,800
to collect money you owe her.

265
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,080
Zin?

266
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,440
Oh!  I forgot, how much do I owe her?

267
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,680
But just by coincidence,

268
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,800
I have no money with me today.

269
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,960
The total is eighty five hundred.

270
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,360
8,500... hang on...

271
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Here you go...

272
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,480
Ahh, how about just the interest for now?

273
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,960
Well...

274
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Here it is...

275
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,960
You idiot!  You think I'm stupid?

276
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Hey, Chun?

277
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,920
Teach them.  Let them know

278
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,320
that I won't pay back that money.
Ever.

279
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,320
that I won't pay back that money.
Ever.

280
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,680
Hey hey hey... don't even try, Shithead!

281
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,440
You should get out right now!

282
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,120
Shithead!

283
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,120
There, fetch!

284
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Too slow!  hahaha...

285
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Hahaha, don't let him get it.

286
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
If he does, it's coming out of your pay!
All of it!

287
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,200
This is what they call Hot Potato!

288
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Hey fatty, it's over there!

289
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,680
Throw it here, quick...

290
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,720
Hey!  Over here!  Oi!!

291
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Let's get outta here Zen!

292
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,960
Hey!  Follow them!  Get the money back!

293
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
Hey!  After them!

294
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
They took the money!

295
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
Hey!

296
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,120
Did you get the money?

297
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Yes, got it.

298
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,320
Moom!

299
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,960
I've ordered the prescription.

300
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,480
You can get it downtown.

301
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,360
Why don't you take her home for the day?

302
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,240
I'll make another appointment for her

303
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,840
when you have more money.

304
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,080
And don't forget to make her

305
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,560
take her medicine.

306
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,960
She is very weak,

307
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,440
so make sure she gets lots of rest.

308
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Thank you so much, doctor.

309
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,440
How are you, auntie?

310
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,440
She's that good?

311
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,320
Yes, she's extraordinary and crazy.

312
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,600
Thomas, go and play somewhere else.

313
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,480
What is this Zin up to?

314
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
What's she planning?

315
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Just keep an eye on her.

316
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,960
Excuse me sir,

317
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,080
is there someone named Guang here?

318
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,120
He should be here.
Go and look inside.

319
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Don't be afraid! Let's go home.

320
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,480
Gotta get money...

321
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,120
Come here

322
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,920
Mum's money...

323
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
Sit down.

324
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Don't go.

325
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,920
You'll only see the flies again.

326
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,680
No!  Gotta get Mum's money!

327
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,440
Take me back there now!

328
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,560
What's all the noise?

329
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Nothing auntie.

330
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,960
What did you say?

331
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,720
It's been two weeks already and
still not finished?

332
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,600
Stop the nonsense!

333
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Tell him if it's not ready tomorrow,

334
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,600
he'll have the same fate as his brother.

335
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Hey, do you know what you're doing?

336
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Give it here.  I'll show you.

337
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Zin's daughter?

338
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,360
My mum's money!

339
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,200
Get it if you can!

340
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,680
Get them!

341
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,960
Come down here and help!  Hurry!

342
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,840
Give me mum's money

343
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,840
It's only 5,000, why do you have to do this?

344
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,560
Take it!

345
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,560
We have confirmed the chemotherapy.

346
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,600
Oh, by the way, somebody
left this candy for your sister.

347
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,360
The person was just here.

348
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,480
Who was it?

349
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,480
I don't remember.

350
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,200
Here, someone left you a treat.

351
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,320
Moom, can you come here?

352
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,720
What did you guys do?
Why are you covered in bruises?

353
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,720
Where did you get all the money?

354
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,720
Uhhhmmm.....

355
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,200
How did this get here?

356
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,560
What did you do?

357
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,800
Nothing, I went to the hospital.

358
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,840
I asked, who did you go to see?

359
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,960
Nothing, I went to the hospital and...

360
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,960
And what?!?

361
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,840
Listen to me auntie!

362
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,480
What's your excuse?

363
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:57,960
I asked you to take care of Zen,
but what did you end up doing?

364
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,960
I asked you to take care of Zen,
but what did you end up doing?

365
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,920
What do you want me to do?

366
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,320
I found your book with all the names
of people who owe you money.

367
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,960
It's all your money, isn't it?

368
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,960
However, I didn't know the full story.

369
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,800
We don't have enough money
to pay for your medicine.

370
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,800
It is so expensive.

371
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,440
You're dying, and Zen is mentally handicapped.

372
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,960
We need the money!

373
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,960
What else are we to do?

374
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,480
Who did you go and see?

375
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,000
The people in the book.

376
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
What's going on?  Who are they?

377
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,840
Did you have trouble with them?

378
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,680
We need this money,

379
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,680
it could save your life.

380
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,440
Moom, can you do me a favour?

381
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,800
Can you take a letter to Nishi San restaurant.

382
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Tell him it's extremely important.

383
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,480
Thanks.

384
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,960
Sorry to trouble you.

385
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
I'll try to reach him.

386
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,960
If I can reach him, I'll call you.

387
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,680
Hang on!

388
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,440
Zin is trying to send this letter to her husband.

389
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,440
What should we do this time?

390
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,600
Just send it.  We can then
settle this once and for all.

391
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,640
It looks like he may return to Thailand.

392
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,200
I need to return to Thailand immediately.

393
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,000
Hello?

394
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yes...

395
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,960
I understand.

396
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,960
I'll be there immediately.

397
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,960
See you there.

398
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,440
Hello?

399
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,440
I thought you said they were next door.

400
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,800
I haven't seen a single soul!

401
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,000
More silent than a cemetery.

402
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Wait for me there.

403
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,480
OK, I'll be here.

404
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,480
Just hurry.

405
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,120
Oh... this is ruining my mood...

406
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,120
Can you change the channel?
I don't like it.

407
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,840
Ah...

408
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,000
They already left before I got here.

409
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,040
They're not here but they
should still be alive.

410
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,240
Ah...

411
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,360
But the gang was here waiting for them.

412
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,920
I'll try the store.

413
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,920
Ah...

414
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,920
I will go..

415
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,120
It's me, remember?

416
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,960
You know there's no escape.

417
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,960
I am not afraid to kill him.

418
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,720
Brother Moom, where are you?

419
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,480
Let's catch up.

420
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,000
It's been a long time.

421
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
We miss you here.

422
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,240
Haven't seen you in a while.

423
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,240
You look horrible.

424
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,960
Give me back my brother.

425
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,960
I want to go home.

426
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,200
Wouldn't that be nice.

427
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,920
If he cared for your kid at all,

428
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,800
she wouldn't be going around

429
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,800
robbing people.

430
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,960
It's my money.

431
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,320
It's our money.  It's our business.

432
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,320
It was our agreement.

433
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,360
Nothing was ever yours.

434
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,120
That all ended already.

435
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,600
But it's not finished with me.

436
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,600
Your kid went around beating up my guys.

437
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,120
My people were killed by your husband.

438
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,120
Then let's end it all here today.

439
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,680
Mum... Where's Moom?

440
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,680
So you really want to see him?

441
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,680
I can arrange that.

442
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,960
Moom!  Moom!

443
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,680
If you hadn't gone with that Japanese,

444
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,800
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

445
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,840
Now I'll have to kill you.

446
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
Zen!

447
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,200
Come here!

448
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,080
Zen!

449
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,480
You bastard!

450
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,240
This is between us now.

451
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,240
Just you and me.

452
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,960
Great great!

453
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,960
Come on!!

454
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:04,320
Zen!

455
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:41,720
Mum!!

456
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,720
Mother...

457
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,680
Stop it!  Let Zen go!

458
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,840
Flies!

459
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,600
Mum!!  Mum!!  Mum!!

460
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,600
Mum......

461
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,800
In reality,

462
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,440
any life

463
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,960
can never be perfect.

464
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,080
But I discovered that

465
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,080
one thing can make things less imperfect,
one thing can bring life close to perfection.

466
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,120
one thing can make things less imperfect,
one thing can bring life close to perfection.

467
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,600
It is love.
We must find love.

468
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,600
It is love.
We must find love.
