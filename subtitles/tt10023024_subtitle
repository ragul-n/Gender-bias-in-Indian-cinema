1
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,791
Why are you following me?
Tell me right now! Why?

2
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,833
-No.
-No? So, you're denying it?

3
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,916
You mean to say that you haven't been
following me for a month and 13 days?

4
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,875
-No...
-You're denying it again!

5
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,833
-I mean...
-Yeah, tell me!

6
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,166
I'll stop following you.

7
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:38,750
Did I tell you to stop following me?

8
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,625
-No.
-Then?

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,875
Damn!

10
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,916
Tell me!

11
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,666
You rejected me.

12
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,208
But still
you've been following me.

13
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,583
What are you up to?

14
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,958
You're not just any girl.

15
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,333
What?

16
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,458
How do I tell you that you're special?

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,958
Do I need to explain that as well?

18
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,583
If I must explain how special
I am, then what will you do?

19
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,416
Aren't you supposed to know that?

20
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,333
What do you mean?

21
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,833
<span style="style.center_1">The internet experts know</span>

22
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,000
<span style="style.center_1">Who Kabir and Rumi are</span>

24
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,791
<span style="style.center_1">Fill my head</span>

25
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,708
<span style="style.center_1">You think you know it all</span>

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,750
<span style="style.center_1">You think you're ready</span>

27
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,708
<span style="style.center_1">But when your time comes...</span>

28
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,166
<span style="style.center_1">Your body trembles</span>

29
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,041
<span style="style.center_1">Life turns upside down</span>

30
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,125
<span style="style.center_1">There's a pounding in your chest</span>

31
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,833
<span style="style.center_1">My heart beats fast</span>

32
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,541
<span style="style.center_1">Your heart beats fast</span>

33
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,541
<span style="style.center_1">The knocking, the locking</span>

34
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,458
<span style="style.center_1">The talking, the chatting</span>

35
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,291
<span style="style.center_1">Our racing hearts</span>

36
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,291
<span style="style.center_1">They don't know how to slow down</span>

37
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,833
<span style="style.center_1">Right here, right now</span>

38
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,791
<span style="style.center_1">Everywhere...</span>

39
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,666
<span style="style.center_1">Till the end of the world</span>

40
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,291
<span style="style.center_1">I have to live like this</span>

41
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,541
<span style="style.center_1">Some say love is taking</span>

42
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,166
<span style="style.center_1">Others say love is giving</span>

43
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,291
<span style="style.center_1">Love has a million definitions</span>

44
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,750
<span style="style.center_1">Though it cannot be defined</span>

45
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,500
<span style="style.center_1">It might be artificial or original</span>

46
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,541
<span style="style.center_1">The problem is eternal</span>

47
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,000
<span style="style.center_1">A day will come when you</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Won't be able to escape</span>

00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,791
<span style="style.center_1">Your beguiling heart</span>

49

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,625
<span style="style.center_1">My heart beats fast</span>

51
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,500
<span style="style.center_1">Your heart beats fast</span>

52
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,375
<span style="style.center_1">The problems, the limitations</span>

53
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,250
<span style="style.center_1">The uncontrollable emotions</span>

54
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,041
<span style="style.center_1">Our racing hearts</span>

55
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,875
<span style="style.center_1">They're not ready to listen</span>

56
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,500
<span style="style.center_1">They keep beating faster</span>

57
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,541
<span style="style.center_1">Till the end of the world</span>

58
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,166
<span style="style.center_1">I have to live like this</span>

59
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,125
-This isn't right.
-What?

60
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,541
We're not fully utilizing the situation.

61
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,000
Listen, you're getting me wrong.

62
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,083
Can I get your number?

63
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,291
I saw him again.

64
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,500
He's drinking a soda... alone.
I mean, who does that?

65
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,333
No, he doesn't like me.
He's just weird.

66
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,833
<span style="style.center_1">You know, in case he pops up again.</span>

67
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,416
-You?
-Yes, me.

68
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,041
Yes.

69
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,791
-Do you rent this place?
-Is that a problem?

70
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,500
Do you want it?

71
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,625
I'm a software programmer.

72
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,916
I need a place to work.
I work all day long without a pause.

73
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,208
Where?

74
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,208
-Anywhere. Sit there.
-No, I'll just...

75
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,375
What's going on?

76
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,166
The moment you feel
I'm troubling you...

77
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:42,750
I'll go away.

78
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,458
Oh, yeah? You wish!

79
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,583
Can you come out for a moment?
Come on, let's meet outside the cafe.

80
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,375
What the hell's going on?

81
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,083
You reject me.

82
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,000
And ever since, you've been following me.

83
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,291
What's going on in your silly mind?

84
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,791
How do I tell you that you're special?

85
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,250
So, I need to explain that as well?

86
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,750
What will you do then?
Aren't you supposed to know that?

87
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,166
So... all good?

88
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,500
Where are you going?

89
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,166
-How are you going?
-By cab.

90
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,875
Why do you guys always go the wrong way?

91
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,333
Can you see my location?

92
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,666
Go on, tell me.

93
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,666
-Where are you going?
-Anywhere.

94
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,250
The cab's taking forever.

95
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,833
-I'm going to Champa Gali.
-Oh, I'm also going there.

96
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,000
-I don't need you for sex.
-What?

97
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,583
I can have sex with any girl.

98
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,208
You're something else!

99
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,750
Maybe, you're the one!

100
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,416
I'm here on a date.

101
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,208
-So?
-So, nothing.

102
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,458
I'm just informing you.

103
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,875
-This cannot happen.
-What?

104
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,041
You cannot thank me.

105
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,083
Don't get too excited.

106
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,750
There's something about you.

107
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,625
No, there's something about you.

108
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,000
Not so close!

109
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,458
-I'm like this with all the girls?
-Aren't you?

110
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,833
I don't bring just anyone
to an expensive joint like this.

111
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,000
You're special, you know?

112
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,666
Do you know how much
a glass of tequila costs here?

113
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,000
Where are you going?

114
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,916
Take it back. I haven't touched it.

115
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,541
Hey, wait!

116
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,333
Watch me go!

117
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,583
-Zoe, that was a better joint.
<span style="style.center_1">-What's going on in your silly mind?</span>

118
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,166
Come on. We'll have fun.

119
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,291
Let's go in there!

120
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,291
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, yeah? You wish!</span>

121
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,458
<span style="style.center_1">Aren't you supposed to know that?</span>

122
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,291
<span style="style.center_1">And ever since, you've been following me.</span>

123
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,708
He must be here somewhere.

124
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,708
Hey, brother! Is this your bike?

125
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,500
Are you blind? Can't you see my car?

126
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,333
Excuse me, can you hear us?

127
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,791
Maybe, his ears are blocked.

128
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,791
I swear!

129
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,000
-Hit that scoundrel! Come on!
-Hit him!

130
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,458
Let him go! He's a kid.
You'll kill him. Stop!

131
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,125
He hit me first.

132
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,375
Hey, you...

133
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,125
Hey, leave him alone.

134
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,208
Can you give me a tablet for a headache?

135
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,875
Please, allow me!

136
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,375
-My special drink.
-What's that?

137
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,291
You see, I have years
of drinking experience.

138
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,625
I have an important meeting today.

139
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,791
So, how was your date?

140
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,166
You know... the bike guy?

141
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,250
You went with the guy
who came here for you, right?

142
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,666
It's none of your business.

143
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,541
What?

144
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,458
"Second of all" is wrong.
It's "Secondly."

145
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,541
I was not on a date with him.

146
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:45,250
He gave me a lift,
so I could meet my date on time.

147
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,083
The poor sucker!

148
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,125
You should've dated the biker instead.
He's cool.

149
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,791
He is just... okay.

150
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,500
He's serious about you.

151
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,541
That's it! That is the problem.

152
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:01,958
He's too serious.

153
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,750
That's a problem?

154
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,750
Leena, I'm serious about you.

155
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,166
He's serious about you
and that's a problem?

156
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,958
I'm not fooling around with you.
No matter what people tell you.

157
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,291
Can you please tell me
how it is the problem?

158
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,916
Being serious is a good
thing from where I come.

159
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,875
And where's that?

160
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,416
Old India... from many years ago.

161
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,875
Okay, so now...

162
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:35,375
after many years, there's this
22-year-old girl in new India...

163
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,583
who--

164
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,250
How do you say "one and half" in Hindi?

165
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,125
<span style="style.center_1">-Dedh.</span>
-She hasn't even had <span style="style.center_1">dedh</span> boyfriends yet.

166
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,041
So, that's why, she isn't interested
in a serious relationship.

167
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,458
It's time for fun and exploration!

168
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,458
I'm focusing all my energy on my career.

169
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,083
Five years from now...

170
00:18:55,208 --> 00:19:00,291
when my event management company will be
doing well and I'll be earning enough...

171
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,916
then I'll have my first
serious relationship.

172
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,791
You think all this will go
according to your plan?

173
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,875
Time passed. Everything changed.

174
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,041
This time shall also pass.

175
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,125
And things will change again.

176
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,208
This idiot...

177
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:30,166
is new...
because he hasn't changed one bit.

178
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,125
-Who?
-Him, who else?

179
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,500
You know he's just like me.

180
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,041
No, no... sorry!

181
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,208
He's not like me.

182
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,791
I was like him...

183
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,333
<span style="style.center_1">Kulfi...</span>

184
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,958
<span style="style.center_1">Kulfi</span> for sale!

185
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,041
<span style="style.center_1">My crazy heart</span>

186
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,625
<span style="style.center_1">Knows no peace</span>

187
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,875
-<span style="style.center_1">Without my lover</span>
-<span style="style.center_1">Kulfi</span> for sale!

188
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,916
<span style="style.center_1">My crazy heart</span>

189
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,291
<span style="style.center_1">Knows no peace</span>

190
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,916
Hurry up, brother!

191
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,291
-You're taking so long.
-I'll just be there.

192
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,333
<span style="style.center_1">It never listens to anyone</span>

193
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,541
<span style="style.center_1">Kulfi...</span>

194
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,458
<span style="style.center_1">This heart is crazy</span>

195
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:37,041
<span style="style.center_1">It never listens to anyone</span>

196
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,083
Buy it for one rupee, two rupees.

197
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,333
And there was a girl...
just like me?

198
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,166
She was not at all like you.

199
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,625
Ten...

200
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,291
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

201
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:06,916
Nine, ten...

202
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,791
11... 13, 14, 15, 16...

203
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,333
-Do you have her photo in your phone?
-There were no phones then.

204
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,041
How did you manage without cell phones?

205
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,458
Just like that.
It didn't make a difference.

206
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,458
This communication boom...

207
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:35,500
"I said everything else... except
the thing that I was supposed to say."

208
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,375
Oh, wow!

209
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,125
Then, tell me what you could not say.

210
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,708
Oh!

211
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,166
-He's here!
-How's my cravat?

212
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,125
-Hey, Raghu.
-Is that her?

213
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,791
Wow, boy! You're lucky!

214
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,666
-Go on, Raghu!
-This is your chance.

215
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,125
Go, Raghu!

216
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,875
Don't back down, Raghu.

217
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,916
-Keep going!
-Go, Raghu. Go.

218
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,375
Yes?

219
00:24:55,333 --> 00:25:01,083
<span style="style.center_1">Perhaps, I'll never speak the unspoken</span>

220
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:07,250
<span style="style.center_1">Perhaps, you'll understand anyway</span>

221
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:15,208
<span style="style.center_1">Perhaps, I'll find you in my dreams</span>

222
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:21,166
<span style="style.center_1">Perhaps, we'll find a meeting ground</span>

223
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,916
<span style="style.center_1">I am nothing</span>

224
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,583
<span style="style.center_1">Without you...</span>

225
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:37,041
<span style="style.center_1">I am nothing</span>

226
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:41,250
<span style="style.center_1">I want nothing more than you</span>

227
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,958
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing less than you</span>

228
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,750
<span style="style.center_1">Without you...</span>

229
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,875
<span style="style.center_1">I am not myself</span>

230
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,833
<span style="style.center_1">Without you...</span>

231
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:58,208
<span style="style.center_1">I am not myself</span>

232
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:02,375
<span style="style.center_1">I want nothing more than you</span>

233
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,500
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing less than you</span>

234
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:11,333
I used to do just one thing
after returning from school...

235
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,666
You were fine until yesterday.

236
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,916
-Tell me, how did it happen?
-It's nothing.

237
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,208
Shut up, let me check!

238
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:22,333
<span style="style.center_1">I fill my eyes with dreams</span>

239
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:25,833
<span style="style.center_1">Asking myself questions</span>

240
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:29,625
<span style="style.center_1">Answering them myself</span>

241
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,958
<span style="style.center_1">On your behalf</span>

242
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,541
<span style="style.center_1">I pretend to run errands</span>

243
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,041
<span style="style.center_1">But wherever I go</span>

244
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,583
<span style="style.center_1">I make sure to pass your street</span>

245
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:53,250
<span style="style.center_1">I'll never stop trying</span>

246
00:27:54,375 --> 00:28:00,333
<span style="style.center_1">I'll never stop trying</span>

247
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:05,333
<span style="style.center_1">I want nothing more than you</span>

248
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,208
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing less than you</span>

249
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:12,083
<span style="style.center_1">Without you...</span>

250
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:15,416
<span style="style.center_1">I am nothing</span>

251
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,000
<span style="style.center_1">Without you...</span>

252
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,416
<span style="style.center_1">I am not myself</span>

253
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:26,291
<span style="style.center_1">I want nothing more than you</span>

254
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,416
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing less than you</span>

255
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:35,583
<span style="style.center_1">Without you...</span>

256
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:40,958
Careful, brother!

257
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,333
I can't take it anymore!

258
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,541
I can't hold back.

259
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,833
Now, no one can stop this from happening.

260
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,625
What are you talking about?
What's going to happen?

261
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,458
Tell us! What can't you hold back?

262
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,000
This is cheating.

263
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,541
This is cheating.

264
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,833
I don't get those cute feelings.

265
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:19,750
You know, like how they describe
in romantic movie songs!

266
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,250
They just mislead you.

267
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:23,666
I'm not happy.

268
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,125
Where's the happiness?

269
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,791
At night, I feel someone's strangling me.

270
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,208
It's like I have a fever.

271
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,125
I can't breathe.

272
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,958
Someone strangles me. Like this!

273
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,541
No, Raghu! No!

274
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,541
That's it! I'm telling her.

275
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,958
Sit here. Calm down, man.

276
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,541
Come on, have tea.

277
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:44,833
Driver, I'm in a big hurry.
Just tell me! Can you see my location?

278
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,708
Which turn are you talking about?

279
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,083
Are you trying to scare me?

280
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:58,083
How do you always have to go
to the same place where I'm going?

281
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,541
-The moment you think--
-Yeah! I know.

282
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:04,833
I was also going--

283
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,666
-Do you have breathing problems?
-Sorry?

284
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,625
Do you feel like someone's
strangling you at night?

285
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,875
No.

286
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,125
You mean you're sleeping well?

287
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:39,333
I mean I sleep as soon as I hit the bed.

288
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,333
But I get up exactly an hour later.

289
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,708
Then, I can't go back to sleep until dawn.

290
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:55,208
What?

291
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:59,583
Next time, when you're unable to sleep,
you can message me.

292
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,958
No need for flattery.

293
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,166
And you can't be flattered.

294
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,875
You haven't organized
a single corporate event.

295
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,291
Who called you?

296
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,916
Sir, I'm aware that I haven't organized
a corporate event before.

297
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,750
But if you look at our plans--

298
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,791
You make plans as well?

299
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:57,833
I have it all planned
until I retire at 55.

300
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,416
All the milestones are
clearly marked, sir.

301
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:05,875
Before you entered the room,
you unbuttoned your shirt.

302
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,250
Is that also a part of the plan?

303
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:17,666
Well?

304
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,750
Yes.

305
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,791
I unbuttoned my shirt
'cause I wanted to make a good impression.

306
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,791
Is that how you make a good impression?

307
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,875
By flaunting your body?

308
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:35,375
I couldn't leave my body
at home while coming here.

309
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,500
I have to take it everywhere I go.

310
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:43,291
So, I do my best to look attractive.

311
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,208
When I look attractive, I feel confident.

312
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,833
And my work improves because of that.

313
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,791
So, I unbuttoned my shirt for myself,
not for anyone else.

314
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,041
Should everyone shut their eyes then?

315
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,708
-Everyone will look at you, right?
-Yes. Let them look at me.

316
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,375
What does it matter?
I am okay with that.

317
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,750
If they have a problem...

318
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,666
it's because they have outdated
and conservative ideas.

319
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,000
And I can't do anything about it.

320
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,083
They have to sort themselves out.

321
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,125
I don't know what happens to me.

322
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,166
Will I ever be able to control
this "bitch" inside me?

323
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,875
You should let it out,
because that's what you are.

324
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,708
Discover yourself.

325
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,208
Who cares about the job!

326
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,166
Who cares?

327
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:03,166
If I didn't care, I wouldn't have
spent months trying for it.

328
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,541
It's the Mehta Group.

329
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,791
Okay, but you must do what feels
right from the inside.

330
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,041
From the inner you.

331
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:16,500
Every journey eventually
leads to your inner self.

332
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,375
Who tells you these things?

333
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,541
Don't you get forwards on your phone?

334
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,458
Wise words are everywhere. On pens,
books, stationery, truck stickers.

335
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,708
You'll find mind-blowing quotes.

336
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,791
A new bar has just opened where I live.

337
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,500
Their coasters have
such wise quotes on them...

338
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,333
You and I aren't happening.

339
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:52,833
If you like me, you better
stop that right now!

340
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,708
To hell with my inner self!

341
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't give a shit about Life's Truths.

342
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,416
I just want to get my career going.

343
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,708
I'll be so successful that
I'll never need to depend on any guy.

344
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:08,041
I don't want to have any regrets in life
about the things that I want to do.

345
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:10,833
Okay. That's good.

346
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:17,666
And what do you want
to do... with your life?

347
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,291
-Are you trying...
-What?

348
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,250
Are you trying to make fun of me?

349
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,750
I think I should keep my mouth shut.

350
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,791
When you go for an interview...

351
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,291
do you spout wise quotes
off truck stickers?

352
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,875
But this app is India-centric.

353
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,625
Won't Indian farmers use the app
to import foreign technology?

354
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,000
He's gone for a job interview...

355
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,125
and he's picking holes in the job?

356
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,333
Won't it reduce manpower?

357
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:54,666
This technology will make sure that
five workers take the place of a 100.

358
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:57,583
Where will the other 95 go?

359
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,291
He's been scouted three
times by US firms.

360
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:04,166
He gives them some
silly excuse and says no.

361
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,625
Who the hell is he?

362
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,875
What is India's population?

363
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:10,541
Let's just say it's high.

364
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:15,416
Manpower is not our problem. Insufficient
labor is the western countries' problem...

365
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:19,458
which we'll be importing
by using this app.

366
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,416
And you want me to make
the app India-centric?

367
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,000
He thinks he's doing the right thing.

368
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:30,916
I wish I was like him.

369
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,708
What?

370
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,833
It's intoxicating.

371
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,625
He knows he's taking a risk...

372
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:44,500
but he wants to follow his heart
and take a leap of faith.

373
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,416
I had that power once.

374
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,083
It's gone now.

375
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,250
You know you should thank
God that you lost it.

376
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,750
That's why you own this business.

377
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,458
I wish he'd also lose that "power."

378
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,750
So that, he can be normal.
How long will he stay stupid like that?

379
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:22,625
I wish all this would vanish.

380
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,333
So that, I could be stupid again.

381
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,916
Please, come!

382
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,666
He's here.

383
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,666
Go ahead.

384
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,458
Let's go!

385
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:07,625
<span style="style.center_1">The season of separation...</span>

386
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:11,041
<span style="style.center_1">Is about to end</span>

387
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,041
Where are we?

388
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,958
I've never been here before.

389
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:17,875
I come here often.

390
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:21,833
Alone.

391
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:27,791
I mean it's the first time...
I've come here.

392
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,416
-Go on.
-What?

393
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:34,916
-Raja said you wanted to talk to me.
-Yes.

394
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,750
What is it?

395
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,875
-I'm not here to kiss you.
-What?

396
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,000
I mean, that's not the main motive.

397
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:52,958
What's happening to me?

398
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,375
Is that how it is?

399
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,583
I didn't know.

400
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:03,333
When you are not with me,
I can still feel your presence.

401
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:08,083
-Now that you're here--
-You could've talked to me on the phone.

402
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,875
What's going on?

403
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:29,250
Everyone has their own unique DNA, right?
Getting caught is in my DNA.

404
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,083
Go on, run!

405
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,625
-Sir, you've got it wrong.
-What you're doing is wrong.

406
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,833
You think this is a brothel?

407
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:47,083
What did you say?

408
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,416
Because of me...

409
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,291
One minute.

410
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,416
What did you just say?

411
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,458
Don't you dare!

412
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,583
Should I teach you manners?

413
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,416
Tell me!

414
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,875
How dare you talk like that!

415
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:08,041
Leena, I'm just scaring him.

416
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,083
How dare you say that, motherfucker!

417
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,666
-Raghu, stop!
-Go on, say it again!

418
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,583
Hey...

419
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,166
Stop it! Raghu, no!

420
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,833
He shouldn't have said that.

421
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:22,750
He didn't give me an option.
He needs a beating!

422
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,416
Raghu, he's a cop. You can't hit him.

423
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,041
You should leave, otherwise
you might get in trouble.

424
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,291
-Raghu's just scaring him.
-That's not what he's doing.

425
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:33,208
There's going to be a big problem.
Please, go!

426
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,416
-Hey, get lost!
-I have to hit him!

427
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,500
He assaulted me.

428
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,000
What's happening over here?

429
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,791
-I'm done.
-He assaulted me.

430
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,125
-He hit me.
-Check if he's hurt.

431
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,625
-This isn't a minor offense.
-I'm so grateful to you.

432
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,208
Look at the rich doctor's boy!

433
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:13,916
Got bail in no time.
If he was a poor man like me...

434
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:16,125
he'd be rotting in jail
for attempted murder.

435
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,625
Who was the girl?
Was she also punished?

436
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:22,125
The doctor's son did it
with the capitalist's daughter.

437
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,791
-You mean they went all the way?
-Of course!

438
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,750
I can't believe that girl
would do such a thing.

439
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:29,833
She must have done it.

440
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:32,875
Otherwise, why would the doctor's son
take her to those ruins?

441
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:35,958
Sister, it's such a depraved behavior.
How can I talk about it?

442
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,166
But what did he do?

443
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,250
The same thing that every man
wants to do with a woman.

444
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,708
Goyal's daughter was vomiting
the other day.

445
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,750
-What?
-Yes.

446
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:47,000
-Is this really true?
-True or false, find out for yourself.

447
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:49,750
Goyal's daughter...

448
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,916
<span style="style.center_1">Your brother was thrown into jail.</span>

449
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,125
<span style="style.center_1">He did an inappropriate</span>
<span style="style.center_1">thing with that girl.</span>

450
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,250
<span style="style.center_1">To get caught with a girl</span>
<span style="style.center_1">at such a bad place...</span>

451
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,083
<span style="style.center_1">Have you heard the gossip that's</span>
<span style="style.center_1">spreading in Udaipur?</span>

452
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,791
<span style="style.center_1">You can't stop wagging tongues.</span>

453
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,583
<span style="style.center_1">-We know our daughter.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-No, we don't.</span>

454
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,750
Don't go by her innocent face.

455
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,500
She must've done it. Otherwise,
why would they talk about it?

456
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:19,583
Stay awake!

457
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,416
-Here?
-Yes, come on.

458
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:00,458
-What's going on?
-Leena, I'm serious about you.

459
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,833
I'll never leave you as long as I'm alive.

460
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,291
I'll take care of you.

461
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:06,791
I'm not fooling around with you.

462
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,583
No matter what people tell you.

463
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,000
You started talking again?

464
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,458
-Your mother is here.
-Oh, no!

465
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:26,875
-Let's elope.
-What?

466
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,666
Get out of here!

467
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:30,750
Sorry.

468
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:35,833
Who the hell is this boy?

469
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:39,041
Hey, boy! What are you doing?
You'll fall down.

470
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,125
-Is Leena upstairs?
-I don't know.

471
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,166
You'll fall down!

472
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,541
-Hey, careful!
-This boy...

473
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,666
Hey, that's him. The doctor's son.

474
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,458
Someone stop him!

475
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,333
Hey! Hey, boy! Stop.

476
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,208
He's the doctor's son.

477
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,500
So, it's settled, right?

478
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,583
How many times must I tell you, Sushil?

479
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,083
Take Leena to Delhi right away.

480
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,708
If she stays here,
she'll bring more shame on us.

481
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,833
Her parents decided to send her to Delhi.

482
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,000
So that they can keep her away from me.

483
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:40,500
I was studying medicine.

484
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:45,208
I always dreamed of being a doctor...
like my father.

485
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:12,500
Dad... I've been thinking.

486
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,458
I want to leave medical college.

487
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:21,875
And you did?

488
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,375
You gave up your career in medicine?

489
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:28,541
And then?

490
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,208
Look straight ahead.

491
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:48,958
Don't worry, brother.

492
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:52,166
Sit down!

493
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,833
<span style="style.center_1">Yes, it's you</span>

494
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,000
<span style="style.center_1">No, it's you</span>

495
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:03,541
<span style="style.center_1">You're the silence in me</span>

496
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:07,416
<span style="style.center_1">Whether you say it</span>

497
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:10,833
<span style="style.center_1">Or you don't say it</span>

498
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:15,250
<span style="style.center_1">You'll always be mine</span>

499
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:22,333
<span style="style.center_1">You'll always be mine</span>

500
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:26,708
<span style="style.center_1">You'll always be mine</span>

501
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:42,541
<span style="style.center_1">Steal me from my path</span>

502
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:48,500
<span style="style.center_1">And take me along</span>

503
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:54,333
<span style="style.center_1">Make some space for me</span>

504
00:49:54,708 --> 00:50:00,416
<span style="style.center_1">Where your shadow falls</span>

505
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,791
<span style="style.center_1">I'll meet you wherever you say</span>

506
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:11,000
<span style="style.center_1">I'll abide by you</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I'll always be yours</span>

507
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:16,500
<span style="style.center_1">Belonging only to you, only you</span>

508
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:23,250
<span style="style.center_1">If there's you, there's me</span>

509
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:27,833
<span style="style.center_1">My need for you will never fade</span>

510
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:31,041
<span style="style.center_1">Whether you say it</span>

511
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:34,750
<span style="style.center_1">Or you don't say it</span>

512
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:40,416
<span style="style.center_1">You'll always belong to me</span>

513
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,500
<span style="style.center_1">You'll always belong to me</span>

514
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:50,583
<span style="style.center_1">You'll always belong to me</span>

515
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:57,041
<span style="style.center_1">You'll always belong to me</span>

516
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:29,750
Please, go away.

517
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,708
What's wrong?

518
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,375
Let me be.

519
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:41,833
Go away!

520
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,833
I've had it.

521
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:09,416
I never thought this would happen.

522
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:14,000
So perfect.

523
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:23,833
I was terrified...
this would happen one day.

524
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:28,750
I made so many plans,
had so many goals...

525
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,416
to save myself from this.

526
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:37,250
The real Zoe wanted nothing but this.

527
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:44,125
I wanted to let myself go! Fuck!

528
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,041
To let myself go.

529
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,541
This is what I want now, Veer.

530
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,458
I'm trapped.

531
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:12,166
The moment you feel
I'm troubling you...

532
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,583
What's wrong with you?

533
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,583
There's no fucking way you can trouble me.

534
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,916
I can... because we've become close now.

535
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,625
No stranger can do that, right?

536
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:27,208
Only those who are close
to you can hurt you.

537
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:35,541
So, the moment you feel
I'm troubling you...

538
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,333
-That was scary.
-Get used to it.

539
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,291
Are we fully utilizing the situation now?

540
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:01,500
Totally!

541
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,125
Barnali called and told me.

542
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:27,791
Start packing now.

543
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:31,375
It's great for my ego.

544
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,625
Especially after
the Mehta Group rejected me.

545
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,875
But I'm saying no.

546
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:40,375
-What?
-I've thought it over.

547
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,333
It's not the right time
for me to relocate.

548
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,833
I'll wait for better options.

549
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:47,958
And what are they?

550
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:53,958
Have you really thought this through?
What are the better options?

551
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:59,458
Roaming about with that boy
on his bike is a better option?

552
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:01,041
What has he got to do with it?

553
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,458
You mean he hasn't?

554
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:07,125
What are you saying, Ma?
Who do you think I am?

555
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:12,041
I know you inside out, Zoe.
You know what I'm saying.

556
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,625
Don't use that word in front of me!

557
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,750
If I hadn't given up my career
to marry your father...

558
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,583
and if I had refused to "chill"...

559
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:26,083
I would not be kneading bread every day.

560
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:29,458
Is it necessary for you
to repeat that every day?

561
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:32,416
I say it because that's my life now, Zoe.

562
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:35,833
I have to swallow my ego, every day.

563
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,833
I have to wait until your father sends
money to pay the gardener.

564
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:41,916
Not the gardener again!

565
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,916
Why do you keep telling me that?
Don't you think I know it already?

566
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,833
Seher also knew that,
but what did she do?

567
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:52,333
And now, you're changing.
Don't you think I can see it?

568
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:54,791
What can you see?
Tell me! What can you see?

569
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:59,166
Everyone goes through this phase.
You're not alone, dear.

570
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,791
You're being delusional.

571
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,750
I also felt that and so did your sister.

572
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:09,208
Now, it's your turn.

573
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:14,250
You're making a mistake
that you'll regret forever.

574
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,541
I've had enough.

575
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:20,000
I'm calling him right now
and I'm going with him!

576
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:25,000
I can't take it anymore.
I've had it up to here.

577
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:31,041
-What are you doing? Listen!
-I can't take it anymore!

578
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:32,750
Hear me out!

579
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:45,208
You are not taking it slow, are you?

580
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:47,791
This is temporary.

581
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:53,208
You're moving in
with your clothes and baggage.

582
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:55,791
Yes, I'm moving in with him. So?

583
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,125
So, nothing! Enjoy!

584
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:01,083
My dad would've killed
me if I had done this.

585
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,041
Everything's happening so fast.

586
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:16,791
I'm sure I'll feel better
once I speak to Raj.

587
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,458
He'll talk about romance
and I'll feel better.

588
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,166
-I'll let Mr. Raj know.
-Is he in his cabin?

589
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:24,958
Ma'am, he's busy.

590
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,250
One second.

591
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,916
You can't imagine how excited
I am to see you here.

592
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:58,833
It's just what I've been looking for.

593
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:04,833
You don't know me,
but I know everything about you.

594
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:10,541
Your meetings on the balcony,
the scooter, the terrace.

595
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:14,166
The guard who caught you at the ruins.

596
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,250
The romantic movies... everything.

597
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,500
-I shouldn't have barged in like that.
-Sorry, dear.

598
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:26,666
Why are you apologizing?

599
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,541
I spoiled your fairytale.

600
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:35,250
I didn't want to disappoint you.

601
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,416
You drove me crazy.

602
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:45,958
By telling me your
sweet romantic stories...

603
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,750
you made me believe that this is possible.

604
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,208
And now, you are with someone else?

605
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:00,875
Things happen in life.

606
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:04,250
What do you mean?
Did Leena die?

607
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,041
You left home for her.

608
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,416
You left medical college.
You abandoned your career...

609
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,708
your city, everything.

610
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:24,333
What went wrong?

611
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,291
I started working at a restaurant...

612
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,791
I needed to earn some money.

613
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,916
I worked 16 hours a day,
slept for four.

614
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,083
Then, I used to see Leena for two hours.

615
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,541
But the last ten minutes...

616
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,250
just before sleeping...

617
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,416
was my time.

618
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:07,208
I used to just sit there and think...

619
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,250
about Leena.

620
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,166
Why are you telling me all this?

621
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,166
What happened?

622
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,208
One day...

623
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,750
Leena came to see me at the restaurant.

624
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,333
That'd be the first recommendation.

625
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:26,625
Hey, Raghuvendra! Your girlfriend is here.

626
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:27,625
All right!

627
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:29,750
You came by bus?

628
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:33,583
Ma'am, this way.

629
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,291
Another girl?

630
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:48,000
-Who was she?
-Who was I?

631
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,583
Don't you have to meet your girlfriend?

632
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:57,833
No. Her hostel closes at nine.

633
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,416
Do you miss her?

634
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,333
Yes. A lot.

635
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,958
You know... I also miss my boyfriend.

636
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,708
Where is he?

637
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,000
Again, tomorrow...

638
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:54,083
The one thing you know you'd never do...

639
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,166
one day, you do it.

640
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:07,625
Then?

641
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,708
Then, there was another girl.

642
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,250
Then, another.

643
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,833
And another.

644
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,833
Why?

645
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:24,916
It's hard to explain now.
Back then, I never used to meet any girls.

646
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:28,750
In Udaipur, there was only Leena
and I was crazy about her.

647
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:32,833
I was totally committed to her,
I promised her everything.

648
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,125
Then, I came here
and discovered a different world.

649
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,000
I had so many options.

650
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:45,041
Then, I figured I was extremely rash
to have committed myself to her.

651
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:47,875
I made a mistake.

652
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:05,458
Did you tell Leena?

653
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,791
I didn't tell her anything.

654
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:16,750
I kept the farce going, spoke
the same romantic dialogues.

655
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,541
I started giving her flowers.

656
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:26,916
Then one day, she caught me with a girl.

657
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,250
Leena, I don't know what you saw,
but it's not how it looks.

658
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,125
You're the person...

659
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,875
who left everything behind...

660
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:19,083
and came here for me.

661
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:22,875
You gave up your whole world...

662
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:26,250
for me.

663
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:28,458
Do you think...

664
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:33,750
I could ever have doubts about you?

665
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,458
Is that possible?

666
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,666
I know you.

667
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,875
You're Raghu.

668
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:50,625
You belong more to me... than to yourself.

669
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:06,083
<span style="style.center_1">That day, I decided I would leave Leena.</span>

670
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,875
<span style="style.center_1">I couldn't be with her anymore.</span>

671
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,500
<span style="style.center_1">I used to feel guilty around her.</span>

672
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:16,625
I started avoiding her. I started
making excuses.

673
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,708
I created situations with
a hope that she'd leave me.

674
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,333
<span style="style.center_1">You haven't seen me in a whole month.</span>

675
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:28,000
Can't you get two hours off?

676
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,791
It's a new job, Leena.

677
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:31,875
Are you not allowed to call anyone?

678
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:33,875
-Is Raghuvendra there?
-No.

679
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,666
-When will he be back?
-I don't know.

680
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:37,833
I'll tell him to call you when he's back.

681
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:54,708
Do you know that my parents were here?

682
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,958
They were asking for you.

683
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,666
They know about us.

684
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:02,583
They wanted to meet you...
but you weren't answering my calls.

685
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,041
They want me to move to Mumbai.

686
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,458
Do you know what I'm going through?

687
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,833
Don't worry, Leena.

688
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,416
I feel terrible.
Stop seeing me.

689
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:23,500
One day, I came to work
and she was already there.

690
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:27,458
She looked different.

691
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,708
I've heard enough.

692
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:37,541
It has got nothing to do with me.
Why am I getting involved in this?

693
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:40,291
It's your life.

694
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,125
And you mean nothing to me.

695
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,375
You're here?

696
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:26,958
Do you get attracted to girls?

697
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,791
Don't you get attracted to boys?

698
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,333
Sometimes, I feel like drinking petrol.

699
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,708
-What's the issue?
-You...

700
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:58,500
and me.

701
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,916
Whatever it is... we'll sort it out.

702
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,250
First, let's sort out my mom.

703
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,083
-That's no big deal.
-What?

704
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,416
She has invited you for dinner.

705
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:19,041
She knows about us. Dad's also in town.

706
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:24,666
You can say no.
I haven't informed them anything yet.

707
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,791
-Why would I say no?
-Because you seem tense.

708
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,666
Of course, I'm tense.

709
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,958
My clothes are at my mom's.
I'll have to get dressed there.

710
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:39,625
-Zoe, do you wanna go?
-Don't you?

711
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,041
What should I wear?

712
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,791
Come on! You're irritating
me now. Tell me what should I wear.

713
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,166
Let me see.

714
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:22,000
I know it's an important day for you.

715
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:28,000
I am sorry... I kept nagging
you to have a career.

716
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:31,375
I ended up putting you off it.

717
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:40,500
You're my daughter, after all...
and as if I ever listened.

718
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,458
Whatever is meant to happen, will happen.

719
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:47,291
-Have a good time, okay?
<span style="style.center_1">-If I hadn't given up my career</span>

720
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:50,166
to marry your father
and if I had refused to "chill"...

721
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,458
I would not be kneading bread every day.

722
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:54,375
One mistake...

723
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,291
and your entire life slips
through your fingers.

724
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:00,666
You will never be able to rewind it.

725
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:06,250
Everything seems beautiful
at the beginning. You'll feel it's fun.

726
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:10,666
Give me an example of a couple
having as much fun later.

727
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:13,166
Money is very important, child.

728
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,250
Never compromise on your ability to earn.

729
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,916
Don't be a fool.

730
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,833
You can't depend on anyone.
In life, you are on your own.

731
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,833
I had gotten the job at Onyx.

732
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:42,708
The company was second on my list
after Mehta industries.

733
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,208
But I deleted their email.

734
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:48,625
I didn't tell anyone.

735
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:50,500
Not even you.

736
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:55,083
-If you didn't want the job--
-Can't you hear me?

737
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,125
Of course I wanted it.

738
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,875
I was waiting for it so desperately.

739
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:04,875
My career is everything to me.

740
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I am killing my career and hiding my
ambition from everyone including myself.

741
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,250
Already.

742
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:17,166
This is the first time my son
is introducing us to a girl.

743
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,500
All for you.

744
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,958
To be with you.

745
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,791
How can I go to Dubai now?

746
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:32,750
Now, the air is pink, the sky is purple.
We're having such fun.

747
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,625
Zoe, let's talk later.

748
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:39,416
Why? Why talk later?

749
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:46,333
Veer, we're making a mistake.

750
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,333
Something had happened and I got hyper.

751
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:07,916
It's okay, child.

752
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:15,000
Now, you're making a mistake
that you'll regret forever.

753
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:21,333
My parents were here, you know?

754
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,708
Can you imagine what I'm going through?

755
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:27,000
One day, when I came home
after an official two-month trip--

756
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:29,166
You know, I'm a bit tense.

757
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:38,333
Veer, let me just say it.
This is a compromise.

758
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,625
I'm compromising.

759
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:44,041
Zoe, you're overreacting.

760
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:45,875
Of course, I'm overreacting!

761
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:54,041
The one thing you know you'd never do...

762
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,666
one day, you do it.

763
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,541
I really wanted to impress you both.

764
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,666
I've messed it up.

765
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,250
whatever it is, we'll sort it out.

766
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:26,458
No. It cannot be sorted, Veer. It's done.

767
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,416
What's done, Zoe?
Nothing has happened!

768
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:32,416
It's fine.

769
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:35,250
It's over, Veer.

770
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,333
You have started troubling me.

771
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,583
I'm moving to Mumbai.

772
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,416
-When?
-Next week.

773
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:05,500
I'll drop you to the station.

774
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:22,541
<span style="style.center_1">It's difficult to decide</span>

775
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:27,458
<span style="style.center_1">Do I tell you what I feel or stay silent?</span>

776
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:31,333
<span style="style.center_1">If I come close...</span>

777
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:36,666
<span style="style.center_1">It may drive you away</span>

778
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:40,375
<span style="style.center_1">I come with...</span>

779
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:45,541
<span style="style.center_1">My wounds and sufferings</span>

780
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:49,166
<span style="style.center_1">And undo the things</span>

781
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:54,125
<span style="style.center_1">I dream of doing</span>

782
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:59,958
<span style="style.center_1">What did I get in place of closeness?</span>

783
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,791
<span style="style.center_1">These distances</span>

784
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:13,458
<span style="style.center_1">These distances</span>

785
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:14,666
Hello, driver.

786
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,625
<span style="style.center_1">These distances</span>

787
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,416
<span style="style.center_1">They say all your feelings...</span>

788
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:29,750
<span style="style.center_1">must be reserved for only one woman.</span>

789
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:32,083
<span style="style.center_1">That's impossible for me!</span>

790
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,958
<span style="style.center_1">My eyes kept wandering.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">They used to see one woman after another.</span>

791
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:39,250
<span style="style.center_1">My bull can mate with ten cows.</span>

792
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:45,166
<span style="style.center_1">I have a goat.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I've never heard it say,</span>

793
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:47,791
<span style="style.center_1">"okay sorry, I am in a committed</span>
<span style="style.center_1">relationship." Never.</span>

794
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:53,375
<span style="style.center_1">In fact, if it sees another goat,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">it bleats, "me, me."</span>

795
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:57,875
<span style="style.center_1">And me? If I talked like that,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I'd be labeled a sinner.</span>

796
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:01,666
<span style="style.center_1">Is this fair?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Is this the world you've created?</span>

797
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:06,000
<span style="style.center_1">You're made to feel guilty</span>
<span style="style.center_1">25 times in 24 hours.</span>

798
01:18:06,083 --> 01:18:09,083
<span style="style.center_1">I don't want to feel guilty.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Why should I feel guilty?</span>

799
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,791
<span style="style.center_1">It's just lust.</span>

800
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:18,375
<span style="style.center_1">Brothers, I bought lust</span>
<span style="style.center_1">at the grocery store!</span>

801
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,375
<span style="style.center_1">No! It's a gift from God.</span>

802
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
<span style="style.center_1">Everyone lusts. You do, I do.</span>

803
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:25,500
<span style="style.center_1">And my bull does as well.</span>

804
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:30,333
<span style="style.center_1">God has given us all</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the same private parts, right?</span>

805
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:34,916
<span style="style.center_1">But my bull roams about stark naked</span>
<span style="style.center_1">while I must stay all covered. Why?</span>

806
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:41,208
<span style="style.center_1">Justice Chaudhary says,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">"Objection, milord!"</span>

807
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:44,291
<span style="style.center_1">If my bull can roam about naked...</span>

808
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,416
<span style="style.center_1">why should I hide my private parts?</span>

809
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:52,125
<span style="style.center_1">Hey, you!</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This is your love story</span>

810
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,583
-<span style="style.center_1">Listen carefully!</span>
-#TODAY. #TOMORROW.

811
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:58,916
<span style="style.center_1">You saw her, she saw you</span>

812
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,291
<span style="style.center_1">Fell head over heels</span>

813
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:05,583
<span style="style.center_1">Her eyes pierced your heart</span>

814
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:09,166
<span style="style.center_1">Love's in the air</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Heart's in the 4th gear</span>

815
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:12,583
<span style="style.center_1">You'll never leave her</span>
<span style="style.center_1">You promised</span>

816
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,541
<span style="style.center_1">Stress will bring you closer</span>

817
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,125
<span style="style.center_1">Wow! Two bodies, one soul</span>

818
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,666
<span style="style.center_1">You're where she is</span>

819
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:23,083
<span style="style.center_1">Like a trailing shadow,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">She's on top, you're below</span>

820
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:26,625
<span style="style.center_1">You'll fight, you'll commit</span>

821
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:30,083
<span style="style.center_1">See that trap?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Now, you've fallen into it</span>

822
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:33,583
<span style="style.center_1">Our rituals, our traps</span>

823
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:36,875
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

824
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:40,416
<span style="style.center_1">Social tyrants, fake humans</span>

825
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:45,125
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

826
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:50,666
<span style="style.center_1">Our guilt, our shame</span>

827
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:54,083
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

828
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,541
<span style="style.center_1">You're in heaven,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The world's a doghouse</span>

829
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:02,333
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

830
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,083
<span style="style.center_1">These sham show-offs</span>

831
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:08,708
<span style="style.center_1">This phony talk</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I'll kick you on the butt</span>

832
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:11,291
<span style="style.center_1">If I was a donkey,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I'd sleep where I please</span>

833
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:14,708
<span style="style.center_1">No one scolds my bull,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">He roams about stark naked</span>

834
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:18,125
<span style="style.center_1">Shackled we are, decked in clothes</span>

835
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,958
<span style="style.center_1">Wake up and run!</span>

836
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:24,125
<span style="style.center_1">Get yourself another lover</span>

837
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:26,958
<span style="style.center_1">Why are you stuck on monogamy?</span>

838
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:30,375
<span style="style.center_1">Why flounder in romantic confusion?</span>

839
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:34,125
<span style="style.center_1">Why get stuck in inorganic equations?</span>

840
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:38,541
<span style="style.center_1">They bind us with their rituals</span>

841
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,291
<span style="style.center_1">Some will break down</span>

842
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:45,458
<span style="style.center_1">They trap me and make me what I'm not</span>

843
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:48,833
<span style="style.center_1">They've cheated me, milord</span>

844
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:52,333
<span style="style.center_1">Our rituals, our traps</span>

845
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:55,583
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

846
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:59,291
<span style="style.center_1">Social tyrants, fake humans</span>

847
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:03,916
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

848
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:09,500
<span style="style.center_1">Our guilt, our shame</span>

849
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:12,458
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

850
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:16,416
<span style="style.center_1">You're in heaven,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The world's a doghouse</span>

851
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:21,083
<span style="style.center_1">O Lord!</span>

852
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,291
So early?

853
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,041
She's not here yet.

854
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:44,458
Can I leave this here?
She'll pick it up later.

855
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:45,791
Going somewhere?

856
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,166
I'm not coming back.

857
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:52,958
I want to close my account.

858
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,375
-I'll go to the counter and--
-What's wrong?

859
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,208
Tell me!

860
01:21:58,041 --> 01:21:59,875
What did she do?

861
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:05,875
There's no point getting
into all that now.

862
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:08,750
I think I'm already in it.
So, what did she do?

863
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:11,458
No, it's alright.

864
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,458
She must follow her heart.

865
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:22,458
Is she that silly? Making a mountain
out of a molehill! Idiot!

866
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:24,958
Let me talk to her.

867
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:28,291
Please, don't.

868
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:29,833
Of course, I will.

869
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:31,625
Then, she'll come back to me.

870
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:34,958
Because you told her to.

871
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:40,375
Then, she won't get the chance
to come back because she wants to.

872
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:43,375
She's right.

873
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:51,500
That's the advice for other people.

874
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:54,666
It's not for ourselves.
The world is not perfect.

875
01:22:57,916 --> 01:23:00,000
I've been around 20 years longer than you.

876
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,958
I can guarantee this world
is far from perfect.

877
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,500
I know you're sincere.

878
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:13,208
But there are some lessons
I want to learn for myself.

879
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:18,458
What if you lose her?

880
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,833
What if she doesn't come back?

881
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,958
You don't have to play
the brave guy, dude.

882
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,791
Everything can go downhill from here.

883
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:30,333
I know. You think I don't know that?

884
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:36,041
But I don't want her back
if I'm going to lose her again.

885
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:41,875
There are so many couples
who live together...

886
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,583
but aren't together.

887
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,666
I won't be able to bear that.

888
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:56,083
I got it.

889
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,791
Don't push her.

890
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:01,125
It'll be a mess.

891
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:27,458
As you can see,
no bike came to pick me up.

892
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:29,416
I'm not your enemy, dear.

893
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:34,208
The '80s are over. Or you could've
been a hit movie dialogue writer.

894
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:38,416
-You missed your chance.
-Don't miss yours.

895
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:11,708
I thought I'd killed my chances the
last time and you'd never call me back.

896
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:20,041
And because we value those qualities...

897
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,833
we want you to organize an event
we think you're bound to mess up.

898
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,125
<span style="style.center_1">Don't wait for me.</span>

899
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:29,125
I'm calling from
the Mehta Group Head office.

900
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:33,458
Yes, the same! I'm joining immediately.
Barnali is calling all the vendors here.

901
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:35,958
The chairs are being set up.

902
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:38,083
In two hours, the AV system will be here.

903
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,291
You've gone through the checklist twice.

904
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,375
Did you ever think we'd get
a Mehta Group event?

905
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,958
So? Are you ready to fail?

906
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:56,750
I must say your dress code
is rather unexpected.

907
01:25:57,166 --> 01:26:00,291
I'll check everything one last time,
then I'll get changed.

908
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:03,833
We'll need this much space.

909
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:06,166
It's fine if the client wants
an open-air event...

910
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,541
but in an open mall
or a mill compound?

911
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,375
Is this okay?

912
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,291
So, we'll ask them.

913
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:20,875
Pragati Maidan or Cyber City?

914
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:34,916
it must roll from one end
to another, no matter what.

915
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,750
Why isn't she working full-time for us?

916
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,541
Why aren't you working full-time for us?

917
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:03,791
Wasn't that Harshvardhan Mehta?

918
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:06,166
What did he say?

919
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:13,666
Are you happy?

920
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:16,000
Maybe.

921
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:17,708
Maybe?

922
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:23,000
You don't know if you're happy?
Everything's going so well.

923
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,916
Your career is taking off.

924
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,291
So, I must be happy.
I don't know.

925
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:52,541
That's my new line.

926
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:56,166
Whenever anyone asks me,
that's what I say.

927
01:27:57,791 --> 01:28:01,250
Mom asked me if I was happy.

928
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:05,333
I thought...

929
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:11,250
I don't even know.

930
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,291
I can't feel anything these days.

931
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:19,208
I've become someone else.

932
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,916
I've invented a new detox drink.

933
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:28,458
-How did you do it?
-Sorry?

934
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:32,916
You own four restaurants
and this cafe as well.

935
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:35,250
You started from scratch.

936
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:40,000
I'm finding it so tough.
I'm becoming a robot.

937
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,250
How did you manage it?

938
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:48,541
As if I did.

939
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:10,791
When my boyfriend
and your girlfriend are far away...

940
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:13,541
we make do with one another.

941
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:19,791
Besides, Tuteja has us working like dogs.

942
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:21,958
So, we deserve some fun.

943
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,375
Life, yeah?

944
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:36,375
I'm learning.

945
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:40,208
Don't learn too much.

946
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:47,166
It's not like you bought lust
from a grocery store.

947
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:49,458
What?

948
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:54,000
What you felt came naturally.

949
01:29:56,875 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm not going to spin you some yarn
to justify what I've done.

950
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,458
What I did was wrong.

951
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:08,833
What's right, what's wrong?

952
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:13,333
These rules are made by society.
They keep changing.

953
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:17,083
Some years ago, gay relationships were
unacceptable. Now, they're accepted.

954
01:30:17,916 --> 01:30:20,500
So, you did what you felt was
natural according to you.

955
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:24,416
All this love and passion for one person.

956
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,625
To love one person for a whole lifetime,
it's not natural.

957
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:30,958
All this romantic bullshit
is just fed to us.

958
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:34,375
So that we stay in line.
It's kind of a mental jail.

959
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:38,666
You're taking it too far.

960
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,666
Balancing life and a career is hard...

961
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:46,875
and I'm unable to do that.

962
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:49,000
My personal life is zero.

963
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:54,083
How have you managed such
a colorful personal life?

964
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,250
Remember? Getting caught is in my DNA.

965
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,833
Again?

966
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:05,333
You scum!

967
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:09,583
What were you thinking?
Is this a brothel?

968
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:12,916
Come downstairs right now!

969
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:15,000
Leave this door open!

970
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:18,583
Let everyone see your nakedness.
Come down!

971
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,875
Take a good look at them!

972
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:31,083
And you, Raghuvendra!

973
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:35,625
Day and night you've bored me
with the stories of your girlfriend.

974
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:38,333
And this is what you're up to?

975
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:41,375
I'm talking to you!
Have you no shame?

976
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,125
-I'm standing right here.
-What?

977
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:44,875
You don't need to shout.

978
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,333
How dare you talk to me like that!

979
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,916
That's it, get out! Out!

980
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:52,541
Hey, you! Don't be jealous.

981
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:58,208
-Turning green!
-I know what "jealous" means.

982
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:01,541
That's it, you also get out. Out!

983
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:05,333
Sweetu, the owner of Zenith
offered me 10,000 rupees a month.

984
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:06,791
I'm gonna ask for 15,000.

985
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:09,458
-You--
-Come with me, we'll talk to him together.

986
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:12,125
He's opening a new section.
He'll need another manager.

987
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:14,291
Stealing staff from under my nose--

988
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:16,833
-Who wants higher wages?
-Hey, you!

989
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:18,083
Come with us.

990
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:21,625
Get this fella out of here!
You dog, you lowlife!

991
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,875
Throw him out right now!

992
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:27,291
Are you deaf?

993
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:36,125
If you don't pay me 25,000,
I'm not coming back.

994
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:41,541
Did you really say all that?

995
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,958
He came back to me a month later
with an offer of 25,000.

996
01:32:45,916 --> 01:32:47,416
-So, you went back?
-No.

997
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:51,208
Because another restaurant
offered me even more.

998
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:57,375
But the point is when I came to Delhi,
I changed.

999
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:58,750
I became street-smart.

1000
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:00,750
I became familiar with the market rates.

1001
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:05,083
I worked in many restaurants.
My wages kept rising.

1002
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:09,625
A few years later, an investor
suggested I open my own place.

1003
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:18,458
And you went from girl to girl
with no girlfriend to stop you.

1004
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,000
Then, I opened this cafe.

1005
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:23,750
And another girl...

1006
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:25,458
I dislike her habits.

1007
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:26,958
-She keeps changing her mind.
-Oh!

1008
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:28,666
-She said, "Let's take a bus."
-Oh!

1009
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:31,250
When we got on the bus, she said,
"It's too crowded." How odd!

1010
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:33,666
I don't understand one thing--

1011
01:33:57,916 --> 01:33:58,958
Can I follow you?

1012
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:03,291
-I'm not on social media.
-Didn't you work on their app?

1013
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:05,375
I did. That's why,
I'm not on social media.

1014
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:10,500
If your work's done,
shall we grab a beer?

1015
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,666
That's the only way I can follow you.

1016
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:16,250
-You're wasting your time.
-Why?

1017
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:19,750
I'm focusing on my career.

1018
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:22,250
-Your mom told you to do that?
-No, my ex.

1019
01:34:23,166 --> 01:34:25,000
Why bother about your ex?

1020
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:28,125
Because I haven't moved on yet.

1021
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:31,250
Take me on the rebound.

1022
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,458
You're cute.

1023
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:38,875
-But I can't do it.
-Leave that to me.

1024
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:42,125
Okay... let's try.

1025
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:44,250
For real?

1026
01:35:03,166 --> 01:35:07,375
This is possible without you.

1027
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:12,250
I mean it's possible without a girl.

1028
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:21,208
Beer? We can still grab one.

1029
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:23,583
Let's go!

1030
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:32,416
You get so many job offers.
So, what's the problem?

1031
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,833
I don't want those kinds of jobs.
I don't know what I want.

1032
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:05,291
Plastic is a crime committed by everyone.

1033
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:07,500
Do you know what is
the punishment for this?

1034
01:36:16,583 --> 01:36:17,458
Nothing, right?

1035
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:23,500
We are doing so well.
Another date is guaranteed.

1036
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:28,416
You know China makes plastic rice.

1037
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,458
We could go all the way after a few dates.

1038
01:36:33,416 --> 01:36:34,583
After that, it's the usual.

1039
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,458
Plastic was born from
man's greed for money.

1040
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:44,291
Money, money, money.

1041
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,958
Do you know what bank notes are made of?

1042
01:37:11,916 --> 01:37:14,625
You say "baby" like you're
gonna have one.

1043
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:17,750
For that we'd need to do
something first, Zoe!

1044
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:19,708
<span style="style.center_1">Dance, baby!</span>

1045
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,541
<span style="style.center_1">I wanna see you dance, baby!</span>

1046
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,458
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, yeah! Dance, baby!</span>

1047
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,166
Take it. I haven't touched it.

1048
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,375
<span style="style.center_1">Dance, baby!</span>

1049
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:35,250
<span style="style.center_1">I wanna see you dance, baby!</span>

1050
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:39,000
<span style="style.center_1">Dance, baby!</span>

1051
01:37:40,458 --> 01:37:43,875
<span style="style.center_1">And shake your... dance, dance...</span>

1052
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:47,625
<span style="style.center_1">And shake your... dance, dance...</span>

1053
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:57,625
<span style="style.center_1">Dance, baby!</span>

1054
01:37:58,958 --> 01:38:00,166
<span style="style.center_1">I wanna see you--</span>

1055
01:38:12,708 --> 01:38:14,875
-Where are we going?
-Home.

1056
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:18,666
No, I said my home.

1057
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:21,458
Does it matter whose home it is?
Home is home.

1058
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:27,375
You've got it wrong.
Turn the car around.

1059
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:34,750
What are you doing?
I told you I was feeling dizzy.

1060
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,375
Enough, just stop.

1061
01:38:37,541 --> 01:38:40,208
You're such a sweet cute little baby.

1062
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:42,750
-You don't get it, do you?
-What do you mean?

1063
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:45,250
I've been flattering you for months.

1064
01:38:45,666 --> 01:38:49,166
I've taken you to one expensive joint
after another. What for?

1065
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:53,916
Look! I'm feeling sick.

1066
01:38:55,208 --> 01:38:57,708
I'm going to throw up.
My head's spinning.

1067
01:38:58,041 --> 01:39:00,000
You should get an Oscar, by God!

1068
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:06,291
Please, just drop me home now.

1069
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:09,166
We'll talk tomorrow.

1070
01:39:09,416 --> 01:39:12,875
You're hot, but not that hot.
Don't act so pricey.

1071
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:16,750
Girls should throw tantrums,
but they should know their limit.

1072
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:23,083
Please, please, drop me home.

1073
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,416
This car's heading to my place.

1074
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:28,541
The rest is your call.

1075
01:39:38,625 --> 01:39:41,916
Next time, I'll pay a whore
ten grand instead.

1076
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:43,625
She'll be better than you.

1077
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:51,250
I shouldn't have called you.

1078
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,500
Were you headed this way?

1079
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:09,916
-<span style="style.center_1">I yearn for a place of peace</span>
-Keep looking, okay?

1080
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,208
<span style="style.center_1">It's something I've often wished</span>

1081
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:19,791
-<span style="style.center_1">But I have never found peace</span>
-Look at me, okay?

1082
01:41:19,875 --> 01:41:23,375
<span style="style.center_1">My heart is reasonable</span>

1083
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:29,958
-<span style="style.center_1">Why do I not get...</span>
-Don't close your eyes.

1084
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:34,000
<span style="style.center_1">To the place I yearn for?</span>

1085
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:38,250
<span style="style.center_1">Where did I lose myself?</span>

1086
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
<span style="style.center_1">What has come over me?</span>

1087
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,000
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, companion!</span>

1088
01:41:47,583 --> 01:41:49,541
<span style="style.center_1">What did you gain...</span>

1089
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:54,166
<span style="style.center_1">By being apart from me?</span>

1090
01:41:54,666 --> 01:41:57,083
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, companion!</span>

1091
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,500
<span style="style.center_1">What did you gain...</span>

1092
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:03,958
<span style="style.center_1">By being apart from me?</span>

1093
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:09,208
<span style="style.center_1">I have lost myself</span>

1094
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:14,208
<span style="style.center_1">I have lost myself</span>

1095
01:42:14,458 --> 01:42:19,083
<span style="style.center_1">Nor could I find you</span>

1096
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:21,708
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, companion!</span>

1097
01:42:22,291 --> 01:42:24,125
<span style="style.center_1">What did you gain...</span>

1098
01:42:24,291 --> 01:42:28,958
<span style="style.center_1">By being apart from me?</span>

1099
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:50,000
I miss you every day and every moment.

1100
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:05,916
You haven't come back to me.

1101
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:08,291
You're just feeling vulnerable.

1102
01:43:14,916 --> 01:43:17,916
-This is a compromise, Zoe.
-Will you be quiet?

1103
01:43:26,291 --> 01:43:28,375
You were right.

1104
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:30,708
We're not fully utilizing it.

1105
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:33,083
You were right.

1106
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:36,500
Only those who are close
to you can hurt you.

1107
01:43:37,125 --> 01:43:38,625
But what's the point?

1108
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:42,083
We still left each other, right?

1109
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:45,458
Now, you're here.

1110
01:43:48,208 --> 01:43:49,166
And I'm here.

1111
01:43:50,916 --> 01:43:55,916
It's possible for us
to melt into this moment...

1112
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:59,291
and stay here with each other for a while.

1113
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:03,625
Bring each other some relief.

1114
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,666
Do you have to keep talking
about inner truth...

1115
01:44:12,041 --> 01:44:13,916
and ruining the moment again?

1116
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:16,666
But again you'll go away, Zoe.

1117
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:20,916
You're not fully with me.

1118
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,208
What's your problem?

1119
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:26,958
Yes, I have a problem.

1120
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,208
I didn't need you for sex.

1121
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:38,625
And if I wanted to compromise
in a relationship like my parents...

1122
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,125
I would have done that with anyone.

1123
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:44,250
But I wouldn't do it with you.

1124
01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:47,500
I want all of you, Zoe.

1125
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,000
The inner Zoe, the outer Zoe,

1126
01:44:50,208 --> 01:44:52,208
career-oriented Zoe,
family-loving Zoe.

1127
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:58,333
Not the one who has to hide
behind alcohol to see me.

1128
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:02,666
You'll always be as stupid.

1129
01:45:05,375 --> 01:45:09,458
I try hard, but I can't change.

1130
01:45:12,541 --> 01:45:15,083
Maybe, everyone else is right...

1131
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,916
and I'm the only one...

1132
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:28,500
who believes that there's more
to the world than what it offers.

1133
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:31,541
It's possible...

1134
01:45:35,416 --> 01:45:37,000
to be happy with someone.

1135
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,791
An ideal relationship is possible.

1136
01:45:41,916 --> 01:45:43,125
But if I'm right, Zoe...

1137
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:51,875
then this is the only chance for us.

1138
01:45:53,208 --> 01:45:55,291
You and me.

1139
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:58,583
I'm not wasting that chance.

1140
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:02,000
Be with me fully...

1141
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,541
or don't be with me at all.

1142
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:14,416
Then, go! Be alone.

1143
01:46:16,541 --> 01:46:20,500
The world's problems are
not meant to be solved.

1144
01:46:22,791 --> 01:46:26,500
You'll discover
the ultimate truth someday.

1145
01:46:28,291 --> 01:46:31,375
Thank you for bringing me home.

1146
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:39,125
And I hope I never feel so weak in life.

1147
01:46:43,166 --> 01:46:45,458
So that I don't have
to see you ever again.

1148
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:13,666
There's more to the world
than what it offers.

1149
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:20,833
That's what Mark and Romeo wanted.

1150
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,791
And now, Veer as well.

1151
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:28,666
That's not how things work here.

1152
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,750
There is no magic.

1153
01:47:31,416 --> 01:47:32,333
Who knows!

1154
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:36,625
Maybe, he'll find magic.

1155
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,916
Did you meet again?

1156
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:46,833
Driver, where are you?

1157
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:51,625
I'm waiting outside.

1158
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:55,625
I wanted to thank you.

1159
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:58,333
When you broke up with me...

1160
01:48:00,166 --> 01:48:01,833
I felt terrible.

1161
01:48:04,166 --> 01:48:05,625
But it taught me something.

1162
01:48:07,416 --> 01:48:09,625
You broke up with me because
you wanted a career.

1163
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:15,000
Then, I thought what about my career?

1164
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:18,416
I was so obsessed with you that...

1165
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:20,375
I never gave my career a thought.

1166
01:48:22,166 --> 01:48:25,750
Life is not just
about being in a relationship.

1167
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:30,916
Thanks to you I started looking for work.

1168
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:35,708
And I finally found
the job I really want to do.

1169
01:48:36,625 --> 01:48:39,250
-In an American company?
-In the Himalayas.

1170
01:48:40,541 --> 01:48:42,750
It's a multi-purpose project,
water harnessing.

1171
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:44,958
It's a two-year project.

1172
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,375
I'm moving there, so...

1173
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,833
So?

1174
01:48:55,458 --> 01:48:57,875
It's not as though
I don't want to see you.

1175
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:01,208
We may not get another chance.

1176
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:05,958
So, take a good look.

1177
01:49:30,375 --> 01:49:32,708
<span style="style.center_1">There's you</span>

1178
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:35,958
<span style="style.center_1">And only you</span>

1179
01:49:36,416 --> 01:49:41,666
<span style="style.center_1">Every moment is spent in a thought of you</span>

1180
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:46,375
<span style="style.center_1">Why did you walk</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The long road with me?</span>

1181
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:52,833
<span style="style.center_1">You were unaware</span>

1182
01:49:53,375 --> 01:49:58,208
<span style="style.center_1">You are in my every moment</span>
<span style="style.center_1">You walk on my every path</span>

1183
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:03,833
<span style="style.center_1">Why did you take me so far?</span>

1184
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:10,875
<span style="style.center_1">I would never have made promises to you</span>

1185
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:15,625
<span style="style.center_1">Or would I have forgotten them</span>

1186
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:21,958
<span style="style.center_1">In my search on every road</span>

1187
01:50:22,666 --> 01:50:27,250
<span style="style.center_1">I see you</span>

1188
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:33,166
<span style="style.center_1">Your presence makes</span>

1189
01:50:33,916 --> 01:50:38,541
<span style="style.center_1">Your absence feel sharper</span>

1190
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:31,416
<span style="style.center_1">There's you</span>

1191
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:34,916
<span style="style.center_1">And only you</span>

1192
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:45,458
<span style="style.center_1">By now, I know you well</span>

1193
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:48,583
<span style="style.center_1">If you're not by my side,</span>

1194
01:51:48,666 --> 01:51:51,875
<span style="style.center_1">Free my thoughts of you</span>

1195
01:51:51,958 --> 01:51:57,000
<span style="style.center_1">If you must leave me, let me go</span>

1196
01:51:57,583 --> 01:52:02,625
<span style="style.center_1">Why can't I get you off my mind?</span>

1197
01:52:04,208 --> 01:52:09,250
<span style="style.center_1">A lonely life is no life</span>

1198
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:14,291
<span style="style.center_1">It's like a death without dying</span>

1199
01:52:15,583 --> 01:52:20,916
<span style="style.center_1">This life is no life</span>

1200
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:26,750
<span style="style.center_1">If it's filled with tears</span>

1201
01:52:26,833 --> 01:52:31,208
<span style="style.center_1">Your presence makes</span>

1202
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:37,500
<span style="style.center_1">Your absence feel sharper</span>

1203
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:03,708
Oh! No, sir!
This is your office.

1204
01:54:03,916 --> 01:54:05,291
It's Saturday night.

1205
01:54:06,416 --> 01:54:08,291
Why isn't your boyfriend
taking you out?

1206
01:54:10,375 --> 01:54:12,958
Don't tell me you don't have a boyfriend.

1207
01:54:13,625 --> 01:54:15,541
Sir, work is my boyfriend.

1208
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:17,875
That's a line for your clients.

1209
01:54:18,166 --> 01:54:20,333
Sometimes, we tell them the truth, sir.

1210
01:54:23,416 --> 01:54:28,416
You're too young to think like that.

1211
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:34,125
Why have you made your
work your boyfriend?

1212
01:54:35,083 --> 01:54:37,000
Because it's always there for me.

1213
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:39,625
It doesn't waste my time.

1214
01:54:40,041 --> 01:54:41,791
And it pays the bills.

1215
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:46,083
It guides me. It's completely safe.

1216
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:53,333
So, whenever I feel lonely,
I go and hug him.

1217
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:27,458
Harshvardhan Mehta...
dropped by last night.

1218
01:55:29,791 --> 01:55:31,708
He met me in my cabin the other day.

1219
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:34,666
But why did he come here?

1220
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:41,625
What's going on?

1221
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:52,750
wants you to marry his grandson,
Rishabh Mehta.

1222
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:55,708
He said you two have met...

1223
01:55:55,791 --> 01:55:57,125
and you get along well.

1224
01:55:57,416 --> 01:56:00,416
These rich business families
believe in marrying young.

1225
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,166
Anyway, he had come here.

1226
01:56:02,625 --> 01:56:06,333
He said everyone in his family
likes you very much.

1227
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:11,125
So now, it's okay to give up my career?

1228
01:56:13,166 --> 01:56:15,291
Now, I no longer need to be independent?

1229
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:21,500
Now, I can forget what you've
drummed into me all my life?

1230
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:27,625
Zoe... your life and my life...

1231
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:29,208
are not alike.

1232
01:56:30,666 --> 01:56:33,500
No rich Mehta ever proposed to me.

1233
01:56:36,458 --> 01:56:41,166
Then, I'll tell Rishabh to marry you
instead of marrying me.

1234
01:56:41,750 --> 01:56:45,416
Besides, my mother is
prettier than I am. Right?

1235
01:56:45,625 --> 01:56:47,000
Bravo, Ma!

1236
01:56:50,083 --> 01:56:53,000
I can only tell you and your
sister what I believe is right.

1237
01:56:54,708 --> 01:56:56,416
Maybe, I'm not always right.

1238
01:56:57,250 --> 01:57:00,375
Sometimes, I off-load my
insecurities on you.

1239
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:23,250
<span style="style.center_1">I guess we end up</span>
<span style="style.center_1">parenting our parents.</span>

1240
01:57:23,333 --> 01:57:25,291
It's damn confusing, babe.

1241
01:57:25,916 --> 01:57:29,791
You spend your life
believing a certain truth...

1242
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:33,333
then suddenly, everything changes!

1243
01:57:33,666 --> 01:57:35,875
<span style="style.center_1">Practical needs never go away.</span>

1244
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:41,250
<span style="style.center_1">Love with your heart,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">but marry with your head.</span>

1245
01:57:41,708 --> 01:57:44,958
<span style="style.center_1">Marriages that last are practical ones.</span>

1246
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,666
This world will always be complicated.

1247
01:57:57,833 --> 01:58:00,666
It'll keep creating new situations
to drive me crazy.

1248
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:04,666
Whichever road I take,
I'll see a "No Entry" sign.

1249
01:58:04,875 --> 01:58:07,208
So, I give a...

1250
01:58:17,291 --> 01:58:19,000
Just tell me a story, dude.

1251
01:58:20,666 --> 01:58:24,125
A romantic... Leena story.

1252
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,208
Transport me to a distant place.

1253
01:58:30,333 --> 01:58:31,583
At least, for a while.

1254
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,541
So...

1255
01:58:45,083 --> 01:58:47,958
four years after Leena left...

1256
01:58:49,208 --> 01:58:53,458
I was in a hotel.
There was a girl was with me.

1257
01:58:54,416 --> 01:58:56,250
I don't want to hear
about your escapades.

1258
01:58:56,625 --> 01:58:58,500
You want to hear about Leena, right?

1259
01:59:03,041 --> 01:59:04,583
This part is the most romantic.

1260
01:59:17,541 --> 01:59:19,000
Four years later?

1261
01:59:20,791 --> 01:59:21,833
Out of the blue?

1262
01:59:22,875 --> 01:59:23,875
Out of the blue.

1263
01:59:26,958 --> 01:59:28,125
Let's watch the match, Leena.

1264
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:34,583
I ignored it three times.

1265
01:59:35,916 --> 01:59:39,500
I'm fed up of you calling me "Leena!"
Go to her.

1266
01:59:42,541 --> 01:59:43,708
There was no reason for it.

1267
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:48,708
It wasn't as though I was alone.

1268
01:59:51,125 --> 01:59:54,208
I spent almost every night with a girl.

1269
02:00:17,958 --> 02:00:19,541
Weren't you in touch with Leena?

1270
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:25,500
All I knew was that
she was in Mumbai.

1271
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,958
Stay longer.

1272
02:00:27,083 --> 02:00:29,625
No, buddy. Sorry, guys, gotta go.

1273
02:00:31,083 --> 02:00:32,041
Personal stuff.

1274
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:56,500
I never understood Leena's effect on me.

1275
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,875
What was so special about her?

1276
02:01:01,916 --> 02:01:03,458
I spent time with so many girls.

1277
02:01:06,333 --> 02:01:08,000
But Leena had something...

1278
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:12,125
that belonged to me.

1279
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:20,291
I kept making excuses
to escape, from girls as well.

1280
02:01:21,583 --> 02:01:23,708
I'd say I had personal stuff
to sort out and go.

1281
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,416
But the last ten minutes...

1282
02:01:29,875 --> 02:01:31,875
before I'd fall asleep...

1283
02:01:34,541 --> 02:01:35,708
was my time.

1284
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:38,458
I used to just sit there...

1285
02:01:38,875 --> 02:01:42,666
and think about Leena.

1286
02:01:46,083 --> 02:01:47,166
Personal stuff!

1287
02:01:51,958 --> 02:01:53,083
Isn't this story romantic?

1288
02:01:54,625 --> 02:01:57,166
Didn't you try and reach out to her?

1289
02:01:58,208 --> 02:02:00,208
A friend always pops up
in a story like this.

1290
02:02:02,208 --> 02:02:05,458
-And this one came from America.
-Welcome home!

1291
02:02:06,125 --> 02:02:07,791
We both got sozzled...

1292
02:02:09,166 --> 02:02:13,708
and like typical Indians,
we started fighting over the bill.

1293
02:02:19,166 --> 02:02:20,916
The story gets even more romantic.

1294
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:22,541
Let me treat you.

1295
02:02:27,666 --> 02:02:31,541
Rathore knew Leena's whereabouts.
Some friends were in touch with her.

1296
02:02:32,208 --> 02:02:33,875
She was running a cafe in Mumbai.

1297
02:02:34,791 --> 02:02:38,166
Go, man! Go to her.

1298
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:40,958
I can't show her my face.

1299
02:02:41,666 --> 02:02:45,125
I behaved so badly.
I was so cruel to her.

1300
02:02:45,916 --> 02:02:50,333
You're sitting here with her photo,
dying to see her again.

1301
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:53,541
Then, you should die! You deserve it.

1302
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:55,416
You did wrong.

1303
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,333
But what did she do wrong?

1304
02:02:59,708 --> 02:03:01,000
Why should she suffer?

1305
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:07,166
If you behaved badly,
you should make up to her.

1306
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:11,666
Spend your life looking after her.

1307
02:03:12,583 --> 02:03:14,083
Just like you wanted to.

1308
02:03:16,125 --> 02:03:18,083
It's been five years
and three months, Rathore.

1309
02:03:18,458 --> 02:03:21,750
Life is much longer than that.

1310
02:03:22,208 --> 02:03:25,833
You and Leena were made for each other.

1311
02:03:26,541 --> 02:03:27,958
We knew that since school.

1312
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:37,208
Go, Raghu! Go!

1313
02:03:37,666 --> 02:03:39,000
Did you go?

1314
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:45,166
Mumbai, first flight.

1315
02:04:11,333 --> 02:04:13,458
Leena? Was she there?

1316
02:04:14,041 --> 02:04:14,916
Yes.

1317
02:04:16,625 --> 02:04:17,541
She was.

1318
02:04:19,583 --> 02:04:20,875
She was sitting inside.

1319
02:04:22,583 --> 02:04:25,500
The same... Leena.

1320
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:35,416
The man I am...

1321
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:40,458
and the man I wanted to be...

1322
02:05:44,291 --> 02:05:45,708
were two separate people.

1323
02:05:49,166 --> 02:05:50,666
They could never be one.

1324
02:05:56,208 --> 02:06:00,500
I didn't lose Leena that day.

1325
02:06:03,916 --> 02:06:04,833
But that day...

1326
02:06:08,916 --> 02:06:10,000
I lost...

1327
02:06:12,958 --> 02:06:13,916
the person I once was.

1328
02:06:22,666 --> 02:06:26,000
<span style="style.center_1">Love is not a promise</span>

1329
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:29,416
<span style="style.center_1">Love is not a ritual</span>

1330
02:06:29,666 --> 02:06:33,250
<span style="style.center_1">My heart is not mistaken</span>

1331
02:06:33,333 --> 02:06:36,708
<span style="style.center_1">It's you I want</span>

1332
02:06:36,791 --> 02:06:40,166
<span style="style.center_1">The rare path</span>

1333
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:43,791
<span style="style.center_1">That leads to a place of dreams</span>

1334
02:06:43,875 --> 02:06:47,333
<span style="style.center_1">In that place called love</span>

1335
02:06:47,416 --> 02:06:50,791
<span style="style.center_1">It's you I want to find</span>

1336
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:54,375
<span style="style.center_1">Wherever you go</span>

1337
02:06:54,458 --> 02:06:57,750
<span style="style.center_1">You'll find me there</span>

1338
02:06:57,916 --> 02:07:01,416
<span style="style.center_1">Wherever you go</span>

1339
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,583
<span style="style.center_1">You'll find me there</span>

1340
02:07:05,083 --> 02:07:09,083
<span style="style.center_1">I want nothing more than you</span>

1341
02:07:09,166 --> 02:07:11,958
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing less than you</span>

1342
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:15,541
<span style="style.center_1">Without you...</span>

1343
02:07:15,625 --> 02:07:18,958
<span style="style.center_1">I am nothing</span>

1344
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:23,041
Now, I look for myself...

1345
02:07:25,208 --> 02:07:26,166
in others.

1346
02:07:28,125 --> 02:07:32,583
I'm constantly looking
for myself in everyone I meet.

1347
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,416
In you.

1348
02:07:38,916 --> 02:07:40,416
Who are you to me, really?

1349
02:07:41,708 --> 02:07:45,083
What difference does it make
how your story turns out?

1350
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:50,625
Why do I feel...

1351
02:07:52,208 --> 02:07:53,916
that you should not lose what I have lost?

1352
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:01,666
You might find him,
but I know I'll never have...

1353
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:04,041
my Leena back.

1354
02:08:39,375 --> 02:08:43,000
<span style="style.center_1">Eyes swell with tears</span>

1355
02:08:43,083 --> 02:08:48,041
<span style="style.center_1">Make the path ahead hazy</span>

1356
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:51,875
<span style="style.center_1">The desires of my heart</span>

1357
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:56,416
<span style="style.center_1">Are no longer within my reach</span>

1358
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:00,583
-Ma'am, he's gone.
-<span style="style.center_1">Perhaps, I will find...</span>

1359
02:09:00,875 --> 02:09:05,875
<span style="style.center_1">Who I once was</span>

1360
02:09:05,958 --> 02:09:09,666
<span style="style.center_1">Perhaps, I will know...</span>

1361
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:14,291
<span style="style.center_1">This path is not for me</span>

1362
02:09:14,375 --> 02:09:20,375
<span style="style.center_1">What did I get in place of closeness?</span>

1363
02:09:22,625 --> 02:09:26,791
<span style="style.center_1">These distances</span>

1364
02:09:31,708 --> 02:09:35,583
<span style="style.center_1">These distances</span>

1365
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:22,666
You're here?

1366
02:10:23,916 --> 02:10:26,083
With all the old problems.

1367
02:10:28,250 --> 02:10:29,416
Nothing has changed.

1368
02:10:32,458 --> 02:10:36,541
I'll never strike a balance
between my career and you.

1369
02:10:38,875 --> 02:10:40,458
I don't know what balance is.

1370
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,666
But how can I stay apart from you?

1371
02:10:50,375 --> 02:10:54,916
Whether it's natural for two people
to always stay together or not...

1372
02:10:56,125 --> 02:10:57,375
I don't know.

1373
02:10:59,875 --> 02:11:03,208
Sometimes, I ask myself...

1374
02:11:05,125 --> 02:11:06,583
am I making a mistake?

1375
02:11:15,458 --> 02:11:18,666
Is there anyone else in the world...

1376
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:23,750
with whom you'd rather make this mistake?

1377
02:11:27,166 --> 02:11:28,291
No, Veer.

1378
02:11:31,958 --> 02:11:36,041
But in the beginning,
everything's wonderful.

1379
02:11:39,458 --> 02:11:41,083
The beginning is so much fun.

1380
02:11:44,458 --> 02:11:49,083
But what if my feelings for you...

1381
02:11:52,583 --> 02:11:54,041
change someday?

1382
02:11:55,416 --> 02:11:57,166
What if it ends?

1383
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:00,875
It will.

1384
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,000
Everything ends one day.

1385
02:12:07,875 --> 02:12:08,791
Then, what?

1386
02:12:12,541 --> 02:12:14,333
Someday your life will end, right?

1387
02:12:18,083 --> 02:12:19,583
The world will end as well.

1388
02:12:22,708 --> 02:12:23,916
But that day is not today.

1389
02:12:26,041 --> 02:12:29,541
Today, I want to make this mistake.

1390
02:12:32,083 --> 02:12:37,833
I want to climb the mountain top...

1391
02:12:39,166 --> 02:12:40,916
and jump off it.

1392
02:12:44,083 --> 02:12:48,125
Zoe... will you jump with me?

1393
02:12:50,666 --> 02:12:51,500
Let's go.

1394
02:13:00,958 --> 02:13:02,875
Now, we're on.

1395
02:13:33,541 --> 02:13:34,666
<span style="style.center_1">Yes, I'm wrong</span>

1396
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:38,333
<span style="style.center_1">My words are wrong</span>

1397
02:13:38,666 --> 02:13:41,958
<span style="style.center_1">The world was created by mistake</span>

1398
02:13:42,833 --> 02:13:46,291
<span style="style.center_1">No one is completely right</span>

1399
02:13:46,791 --> 02:13:49,791
<span style="style.center_1">Let me warn you</span>

1400
02:13:50,916 --> 02:13:54,875
<span style="style.center_1">Do as your heart pleases</span>

1401
02:13:54,958 --> 02:13:58,291
<span style="style.center_1">Do as your heart pleases</span>

1402
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:00,708
<span style="style.center_1">The stage is set and the place is big</span>

1403
02:14:18,208 --> 02:14:19,416
<span style="style.center_1">Yes, I'm wrong</span>

1404
02:14:21,291 --> 02:14:22,791
<span style="style.center_1">You can also be wrong</span>

1405
02:14:23,458 --> 02:14:26,708
<span style="style.center_1">Let's be wrong together</span>

1406
02:14:27,416 --> 02:14:31,291
<span style="style.center_1">Cowards are never right</span>

1407
02:14:31,541 --> 02:14:34,625
<span style="style.center_1">Many miss the boat</span>

1408
02:14:35,708 --> 02:14:36,833
<span style="style.center_1">The sky tears apart</span>

1409
02:14:37,708 --> 02:14:39,041
<span style="style.center_1">The world turns its back</span>

1410
02:14:39,791 --> 02:14:41,125
<span style="style.center_1">The sky tears apart</span>

1411
02:14:41,708 --> 02:14:43,083
<span style="style.center_1">The world turns its back</span>

1412
02:14:43,208 --> 02:14:45,500
<span style="style.center_1">The stage is set and the place is big</span>

1413
02:15:07,083 --> 02:15:11,791
<span style="style.center_1">My unique character,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Your unique traits</span>

1414
02:15:11,875 --> 02:15:15,458
<span style="style.center_1">We'll break, scatter,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Falter and steady ourselves</span>

1415
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:19,708
<span style="style.center_1">Don't judge the wishes of the heart</span>

1416
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,250
<span style="style.center_1">If we go by our minds, we'll stumble</span>

1417
02:15:23,333 --> 02:15:28,083
<span style="style.center_1">My unique character,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Your unique traits</span>

1418
02:15:28,166 --> 02:15:31,666
<span style="style.center_1">We'll break, scatter,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Falter and steady ourselves</span>

1419
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:36,125
<span style="style.center_1">Don't judge the wishes of the heart</span>

1420
02:15:36,333 --> 02:15:39,666
<span style="style.center_1">If we go by our minds, we'll stumble</span>

1421
02:15:40,791 --> 02:15:44,708
<span style="style.center_1">Do as your heart pleases</span>

1422
02:15:44,791 --> 02:15:48,166
<span style="style.center_1">Do as your heart pleases</span>

1423
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:50,583
<span style="style.center_1">The stage is set and the place is big</span>
