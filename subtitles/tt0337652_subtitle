477
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:33,966
Nice sTory, no?
GreaT sTory... yreaT

478
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,881
Thank you walkman,
you jusT saved my life

479
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:52,455
Channel Sinyh's 1 6Th anniversary!
Live iT up

480
01:04:00,452 --> 01:04:02,352
You're looking lovely

481
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:04,689
May l say a couplet?

482
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:10,686
''What if the one l pine for...''

483
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,694
''were to transpire before my eyes?''

484
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:22,061
l've been looking for you forever!
l want to introduce you to my boyfriend

485
01:05:38,817 --> 01:05:42,583
Beautiful house, Mr Malhotra!
- God's gift

486
01:05:50,829 --> 01:05:55,129
Sister, you're looking exotic!
Your suitor will go nuts

487
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:57,802
l'm scared.
- Why?

488
01:05:58,837 --> 01:06:02,466
My friend's sister
was supposed to get married

489
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:07,470
And she was so happy. Then, just
a day before they were to get married...

490
01:06:07,846 --> 01:06:14,615
the boy called off the wedding.
She committed suicide

491
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:20,513
What if it happens to me? Even l...
- Are you crazy?

492
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,828
Don't you ever get these ideas

493
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:28,492
Come on, Priya. Karan,
you aren't dressed yet?

494
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:31,165
Hurry...
- l'll be there in a moment

495
01:06:33,638 --> 01:06:35,401
You're looking lovely

496
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,502
Don't be apprehensive

497
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:41,636
Come my child

498
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,507
My daughter.
- Greetings, my child

499
01:06:43,882 --> 01:06:45,850
Greetings.
- Come, sit with us

500
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:51,983
Beautiful, isn't she?

501
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:59,925
Mr Malhotra, l think
we approve of the bride

502
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:03,527
Consider this offer firm.
- Many thanks

503
01:07:03,902 --> 01:07:08,532
The girl and the boy ought
to meet each other, so we came

504
01:07:08,907 --> 01:07:13,071
l always wanted my son's bride
to belong to cultured family...

505
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:15,413
like yours.
- You are kind

506
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,544
We received proposals
from rich families

507
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:24,549
Then we found out about
wayward brothers and bad fathers

508
01:07:24,923 --> 01:07:28,552
But you'd never want an alliance
with families of that sort...?

509
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,360
But of course...

510
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:32,897
Come son.
This is my son

511
01:07:42,807 --> 01:07:43,899
You...?

512
01:07:45,944 --> 01:07:48,139
This ruffian! He is your son?

513
01:07:50,949 --> 01:07:54,908
What are you saying?
My son is a perfect gentleman

514
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:59,714
l saw that with my own eyes,
when he wrecked my car

515
01:08:00,959 --> 01:08:05,555
What is he saying, son...?
- Daddy, it was a mistake...

516
01:08:05,964 --> 01:08:09,593
Mistake...? Gentlemen might make
mistakes. What ruffians do, aren't

517
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:14,731
Let's leave. We won't have
anything to do with them

518
01:08:22,914 --> 01:08:24,279
l apologise

519
01:08:24,783 --> 01:08:29,720
Please do not annul this alliance!
l beg of you! My sister is a gem

520
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:36,617
Karan, what are you doing?

521
01:08:37,128 --> 01:08:38,755
Out of my way

522
01:08:44,702 --> 01:08:49,639
lf you have any reservations about
my sister, l'll tell you a fact

523
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:51,976
l'm not her brother

524
01:08:53,311 --> 01:08:57,304
Let me speak, Daddy.
This concerns my sister's life

525
01:08:57,782 --> 01:09:02,685
lt's too wonderful a match to be spoilt
because of me! Believe me, sir...

526
01:09:03,154 --> 01:09:08,251
l'm an orphan!
They fostered me...

527
01:09:10,028 --> 01:09:13,987
they cared for me like a son!
But l am not her brother

528
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:20,670
Certainly not!
- Not only a ruffian...

529
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:23,473
you are also a bastard!
- Khanna...

530
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:32,807
You have spoken enough,
you made my son grovel

531
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:37,349
Scoundrels like you
aren't welcome

532
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:39,723
l'd never give you
my daughter

533
01:09:51,068 --> 01:09:56,529
Why are you glum?
Get on with your drink

534
01:09:57,074 --> 01:10:02,706
Dad, you know. l don't drink.
- l know. But l'm trying...

535
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:08,040
and l've nearly had a whole quart.
And you haven't touched it? Come on

536
01:10:11,088 --> 01:10:12,055
Drink up

537
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:18,721
At least drink that much.
Come on, that's my boy

538
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:21,460
A wee bit more

539
01:10:25,202 --> 01:10:29,070
l know, a father mustn't
make his son drink

540
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:42,079
Now touch your heart,
tell me who am l...?

541
01:10:46,123 --> 01:10:49,388
And who are you to me?
- Son

542
01:10:50,227 --> 01:10:55,096
Why did you tell Khanna
that you aren't my son?

543
01:10:57,201 --> 01:11:02,434
The situation was so compelling.
- Compelling situation?

544
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:10,772
Would that make a son deny his father?
Can compulsions wreck relationships?

545
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:17,917
You'd rather stab me in the heart.
- l didn't mean to hurt you, Dad

546
01:11:18,322 --> 01:11:22,122
You didn't? But you tore
my heart to pieces

547
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:29,430
Swear it by me,
have l ever denied you my love?

548
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:32,725
Never...
- Then why...?

549
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:43,478
Never will l speak it again, l swear.
- lf ever you say it again...

550
01:11:43,848 --> 01:11:48,148
you will kill your Dad. Aemember.
- No... no...

551
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:55,454
Let's go home

552
01:11:57,194 --> 01:11:58,491
Help me up

553
01:11:59,897 --> 01:12:02,730
Can't walk on my own anymore

554
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:10,504
Where's our car?
- Over there

555
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:18,375
ls the car drunk too?
Look, l'm driving

556
01:12:19,283 --> 01:12:23,652
No Dad, l'm driving.
- Silly! You're drunk

557
01:12:24,021 --> 01:12:29,425
l'm driving safely.
- No, l'm driving

558
01:12:30,227 --> 01:12:35,859
lf you insist... all right.
l'll sit here...

559
01:12:36,233 --> 01:12:38,531
or is this the boot?

560
01:12:40,938 --> 01:12:44,203
Not the boot. Go on

561
01:12:49,246 --> 01:12:54,206
Daddy, comfortable speed?
- Yes

562
01:12:55,052 --> 01:12:57,384
lf you come across Khanna,
run him over

563
01:12:58,255 --> 01:13:06,720
l drink because my wife heckles me!
- She drives you mad?

564
01:13:07,264 --> 01:13:11,564
Yes, endlessly.
- Why?

565
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:16,906
Because l'm hustling
the neighbour's wife

566
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:22,906
Why?
- Because l like her. Excuse me

567
01:13:25,149 --> 01:13:29,711
Seema, you're way out!
You come up with such fresh ideas

568
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:35,047
This episode on drunkards is a hit.
- Enough of drunks. Let's pack up

569
01:13:41,298 --> 01:13:44,665
Look, 2 drunks travelling
in a stationary car

570
01:13:45,302 --> 01:13:47,270
Let's interview them

571
01:13:49,206 --> 01:13:51,800
Goodness! That's Karan

572
01:14:04,121 --> 01:14:05,850
Please take him to my car

573
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:10,989
Great story. And climax?
- lt'll take time

574
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:57,067
That watch... where did you get it?

575
01:14:59,276 --> 01:15:00,641
Nice, isn't it?

576
01:15:02,379 --> 01:15:04,347
From my boyfriend

577
01:15:11,188 --> 01:15:13,019
Who...?
- Karan

578
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:16,018
l introduced you to him
at the party

579
01:15:19,263 --> 01:15:21,356
Great guy

580
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:29,031
How long have you been in love?
- Ever since we met

581
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:32,500
l fell in love at first sight

582
01:15:35,713 --> 01:15:44,087
l missed reading your story.
So is it your real love story?

583
01:15:48,225 --> 01:15:51,388
Who is he?
- He was

584
01:15:53,297 --> 01:15:56,858
What do you mean?
- Now he belongs to someone else

585
01:15:58,235 --> 01:16:03,969
Strange! You wrote your story despite
knowing that he loves someone else?

586
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,178
Are you so deeply in love?

587
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:11,544
Yes, dearly

588
01:16:14,451 --> 01:16:16,146
That's a great love

589
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,081
But what about that guy
who belongs to someone else now?

590
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:27,556
He never understood you.
My Karan would never do that to me

591
01:16:35,472 --> 01:16:37,770
l pray to God,
whatever happened to me...

592
01:16:38,142 --> 01:16:40,076
may never happen to you

593
01:17:37,968 --> 01:17:40,801
Karan, l have one of your possessions

594
01:17:41,205 --> 01:17:42,763
What is it?

595
01:17:46,677 --> 01:17:51,205
Where did you find that watch?
- Last night you weren't in your senses

596
01:17:51,815 --> 01:17:55,581
Where are you at the moment, Seema?
- Central Library

597
01:17:56,186 --> 01:17:57,915
l'll be right there

598
01:17:59,623 --> 01:18:03,582
Karan, you have no idea
how much l love you

599
01:18:07,364 --> 01:18:09,389
And today l'm going to tell you

600
01:19:06,824 --> 01:19:12,057
Please give me the watch, Seema.
- Pining for a watch so trivial?

601
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:18,462
lt's not something trivial.
lt holds my heartbeats. lt's my life

602
01:19:19,436 --> 01:19:23,065
So your life's in my hands.
lf l wish, l won't ever let go

603
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,103
No... l can't give my life to anyone

604
01:19:29,746 --> 01:19:33,682
Because, it holds my love.
- Love...?

605
01:19:34,718 --> 01:19:37,744
l and Pinky loved
each other dearly, as kids

606
01:19:39,656 --> 01:19:44,355
That's when she gave me this memento.
And suddenly one day we had to part

607
01:19:46,463 --> 01:19:48,431
Ever since, l've been looking for her

608
01:19:51,802 --> 01:19:55,363
What if you don't find her?
- l will find her, for sure

609
01:19:56,306 --> 01:20:00,208
l'm dead sure
l'll find my love someday

610
01:20:01,745 --> 01:20:05,272
We made a promise when we were children.
- Promise...?

611
01:20:05,849 --> 01:20:07,817
You live only for me

612
01:20:08,752 --> 01:20:10,720
And l live only for her

613
01:20:18,495 --> 01:20:21,896
What...? You want to
go abroad again to study?

614
01:20:22,766 --> 01:20:27,726
Yes Papa.
- But you had decided to study here

615
01:20:28,772 --> 01:20:34,142
Aight. But after watching things
shape up, l now know that...

616
01:20:34,511 --> 01:20:38,003
my aim will not be achieved here.
- What aim?

617
01:20:38,382 --> 01:20:41,545
l want to progress,
l want to achieve something

618
01:20:43,954 --> 01:20:46,752
l'm glad my daughter thinks so high

619
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:16,442
Puja? Seema here

620
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:20,779
Puja, don't forget to come
to my birthday party tomorrow

621
01:21:21,425 --> 01:21:23,416
l can't make it.
- What?

622
01:21:23,827 --> 01:21:28,594
l'm flying out tomorrow.
- l don't care. You must come

623
01:21:28,999 --> 01:21:31,968
No, l can't come.
- Please Puja, for my sake

624
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:20,511
Tell us about your love,
and sing a romantic song

625
01:22:39,903 --> 01:22:44,863
You landed your boyfriend in a fix.
- Not mine, he's someone else's

626
01:22:45,942 --> 01:22:49,878
But the other day, you said...
- Misconception

627
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:53,341
Karan is in love with some Pinky,
since childhood. For years...

628
01:22:53,717 --> 01:22:58,552
he has held her memento, a watch,
close to his heart, pining to meet her

629
01:23:40,764 --> 01:23:48,933
''l wish these years fly swiftly...''

630
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:54,609
''just remember this...''

631
01:23:57,914 --> 01:24:01,077
''you live only for me''

632
01:24:06,156 --> 01:24:10,957
''Swear it,
and live only for me''

633
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:23,963
''l wish these years fly swiftly...''

634
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:30,746
''just remember this...''

635
01:24:33,784 --> 01:24:36,981
''you live only for me''

636
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,553
''l wish the passion never ceases...''

637
01:25:21,064 --> 01:25:25,125
''let this obsession grow''

638
01:25:30,874 --> 01:25:34,742
''l wish we love each other
more than anything else...''

639
01:25:35,178 --> 01:25:39,615
''let this companionship be forever''

640
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:48,047
''When a million questions are asked
about our love...''

641
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:54,059
''let's just remember...''

642
01:25:57,033 --> 01:26:00,469
''we live for each other''

643
01:26:05,108 --> 01:26:10,068
''Swear it,
and live only for me''

644
01:26:34,938 --> 01:26:39,307
''Take my hand,
walk beside me forever''

645
01:26:39,843 --> 01:26:44,109
''Let seasons come and go,
but you must never change''

646
01:26:49,152 --> 01:26:53,521
''l wish our bond is never severed''

647
01:26:54,024 --> 01:26:57,926
''l wish we never break up''

648
01:26:58,361 --> 01:27:06,894
''ln happiness,
in sorrow...''

649
01:27:08,071 --> 01:27:13,134
''let's just remember...''

650
01:27:15,412 --> 01:27:19,143
''we live for each other''

651
01:27:23,653 --> 01:27:29,148
''Swear it darling,
only for me''

652
01:27:34,097 --> 01:27:42,163
''l wish these years fly swiftly...''

653
01:27:43,974 --> 01:27:48,172
''just remember this...''

654
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:54,380
''you live only for me...''

655
01:27:56,019 --> 01:27:58,852
''only for me...''

656
01:27:59,222 --> 01:28:00,849
''swear that''

657
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:16,202
Puja, you had promised me that
you'd tell me before you tell him

658
01:28:20,043 --> 01:28:22,603
''You live only for me''

659
01:28:32,722 --> 01:28:36,556
True love wins finally, Neeta.
l have found my childhood sweetheart

660
01:28:36,793 --> 01:28:40,889
And l've kept my promise too.
l'm breaking the news to you

661
01:28:41,331 --> 01:28:46,359
What...? Aeally? How does he look?
- He's so handsome

662
01:28:46,736 --> 01:28:50,228
Know what? He loves me
as much as l love him

663
01:28:50,607 --> 01:28:54,873
He was as desperate to meet me
as l was desperate to meet him

664
01:28:55,311 --> 01:28:57,279
But l won't tell him
that l'm his Pinky

665
01:28:57,614 --> 01:29:00,913
l pined to find my sweetheart.
Now l'll stay close to him...

666
01:29:01,284 --> 01:29:03,582
and find out how much he pines
for me. l want to enjoy it

667
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:09,581
Karan, l've found you. But until
you find me and profess your love...

668
01:29:09,959 --> 01:29:14,259
l won't tell you that l'm Pinky.
l'll wait

669
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:17,393
Yes! lt'll be fun

670
01:30:24,367 --> 01:30:25,493
You...?

671
01:30:29,372 --> 01:30:31,431
lt's you. l just remembered

672
01:30:32,175 --> 01:30:37,545
Are you here to buy a Valentine card?
- Obviously, it's Valentine Day today

673
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:43,444
And you?
- Obviously, l'm here to buy one too

674
01:30:46,189 --> 01:30:50,683
You got a girlfriend?
- Yes, and no. l mean...

675
01:30:52,195 --> 01:30:57,462
The day l find her, l'll give her all
the Valentine cards l've been collecting

676
01:30:58,401 --> 01:31:02,770
Who is your friend?
- He's right before me

677
01:31:03,173 --> 01:31:07,701
Well...?
- l mean, the day l find him...

678
01:31:08,144 --> 01:31:10,544
l'll give him all the Valentine cards
l've been collecting

679
01:31:10,914 --> 01:31:15,817
Which means, you and l are alike.
- No, we are one

680
01:31:16,219 --> 01:31:20,588
Well...?
- How about eating something?

681
01:31:27,463 --> 01:31:31,729
ln only our second meeting, l brought
you here. l hope you don't mind?

682
01:31:32,168 --> 01:31:37,196
Nothing of that sort. But l'm surprised
as to what attracted me towards you

683
01:31:42,245 --> 01:31:44,839
We read your story
published in P9 magazine

684
01:31:45,215 --> 01:31:48,082
You're a great writer.
- May l have your autograph, please?

685
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:55,948
We're excited to know the climax.
- l too am excited to write the climax

686
01:31:56,459 --> 01:32:02,659
When is it being published?
- Well... l'm working on it

687
01:32:08,271 --> 01:32:15,234
That story in P9? You wrote it?
- Yes, but l don't think you've read it

688
01:32:15,778 --> 01:32:20,010
No. But my sister has read it.
She's a big fan of yours

689
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:22,543
She'll be happy to meet you

690
01:32:27,557 --> 01:32:29,115
Aecognise her?

691
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:40,463
Silly girl! What have you done?
Moron

692
01:32:43,506 --> 01:32:47,636
l'll take her inside.
- Hurry up. Wash it up

693
01:32:49,512 --> 01:32:50,638
Silly girl

694
01:32:51,247 --> 01:32:52,805
Brother's washroom

695
01:34:02,452 --> 01:34:07,116
''Sixteen? Or seventeen?
You're terrific''

696
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:10,559
''l've fallen for you''

697
01:34:16,599 --> 01:34:22,162
''Seventeen? Or eighteen?
You're terrific''

698
01:34:22,605 --> 01:34:25,574
''You have invaded my heart''

699
01:34:55,638 --> 01:35:00,268
''lntoxicating eyes,
breathtaking style''

700
01:35:00,643 --> 01:35:05,410
''l fell for you at first sight''

701
01:35:10,653 --> 01:35:14,953
''You're obsessed,
and l'm lost too''

702
01:35:15,358 --> 01:35:20,386
''My love, l've fallen for you''

703
01:35:25,435 --> 01:35:30,099
''Fair cheeks...
you're terrific''

704
01:35:30,473 --> 01:35:33,636
''l've fallen for you''

705
01:35:39,849 --> 01:35:45,253
''Seventeen? Or eighteen?
You're terrific''

706
01:35:45,688 --> 01:35:49,454
''You have invaded my heart''

707
01:36:14,484 --> 01:36:19,012
''You're the only one,
you're beyond compare''

708
01:36:19,422 --> 01:36:23,859
''Yours is the name
in every tale of mine''

709
01:36:28,998 --> 01:36:33,298
''You are in my eyes,
in every dream of mine''

710
01:36:33,736 --> 01:36:38,696
''You have robbed me off my peace...
oh that sway''

711
01:36:43,746 --> 01:36:49,150
''My gait seduces?
But you're terrific''

712
01:36:49,552 --> 01:36:52,715
''You have invaded my heart''

713
01:36:58,694 --> 01:37:04,132
''Sixteen? Or seventeen?
But you're terrific''

714
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,401
''l've fallen for you''

715
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:48,901
So long? Priya must've
chewed her brains

716
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:52,941
Go, save Puja before she quits writing.
- Aight away, Ma

717
01:37:55,551 --> 01:37:57,781
That's brother's night suit

718
01:37:59,822 --> 01:38:06,193
My sleeping suit...?
- My dress is stained

719
01:38:06,629 --> 01:38:10,121
No problem. Come, have tea.
- No, thanks. l'll leave now

720
01:38:10,499 --> 01:38:13,263
Have something before you leave, dear.
- Next time

721
01:38:13,636 --> 01:38:17,003
Do come.
- Would you drop me home?

722
01:38:23,946 --> 01:38:26,506
Stop.
- Let us in

723
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:56,840
Won't you come in?
- Next time

724
01:38:59,782 --> 01:39:03,912
l'll return your dress.
- No need. lt suits you fine

725
01:39:50,933 --> 01:39:53,697
Papa, he...
- l'm not asking you anything, dear

726
01:39:55,805 --> 01:39:59,297
l want to explain some things

727
01:40:00,242 --> 01:40:05,145
l could've built this grand bungalow
anywhere in the city

728
01:40:05,948 --> 01:40:11,580
But why here? Because this is
the costliest place

729
01:40:12,955 --> 01:40:15,924
lt speaks of our status

730
01:40:16,759 --> 01:40:20,251
l could've got the furnitures made
anywhere in lndia

731
01:40:20,963 --> 01:40:26,731
But why from ltaly? Why from
the world's best furniture company?

732
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:32,532
To display our status.
Come, Puja

733
01:40:40,983 --> 01:40:43,952
My vehicles... top of the range,
latest models

734
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:48,622
Because l know,
those who own such vehicles...

735
01:40:48,991 --> 01:40:52,358
their status and lifestyle
stand out

736
01:40:53,996 --> 01:40:58,956
Of all the Universities,
why did l send you to Oxford?

737
01:41:03,706 --> 01:41:07,198
Oxford's stamp is
on your degree certificate

738
01:41:13,783 --> 01:41:16,775
Change the dress

739
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:39,473
Don't cry, my baby.
Smile like your mummy

740
01:41:42,812 --> 01:41:44,404
l'll dice them

741
01:41:49,051 --> 01:41:53,454
You didn't believe me

742
01:41:54,857 --> 01:41:58,349
Come over, and see for yourself

743
01:41:59,829 --> 01:42:05,028
See what?
- Your husband

744
01:42:06,068 --> 01:42:08,832
He's sitting with his family number 2

745
01:42:10,806 --> 01:42:16,836
l can't find words to describe.
Whatever is to be done, is upto you

746
01:42:29,892 --> 01:42:34,625
What are you staring at?
- Today, l'm watching

747
01:42:35,097 --> 01:42:37,725
Tomorrow, the world will watch.
- What do you mean?

748
01:42:38,133 --> 01:42:41,193
Look...
- lt's her!

749
01:42:42,104 --> 01:42:48,805
But who's baby it is on Daddy's lap?
- His second son. Your little brother

750
01:42:49,178 --> 01:42:54,138
What nonsense!
- You don't believe your eyes?

751
01:42:55,918 --> 01:42:58,079
Look at him

752
01:42:58,721 --> 01:43:05,627
The affection he's showing on his second
son, he must've never shown on you

753
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:12,199
You mustn't grieve, Karan. Okay?
But you are a goner

754
01:43:13,802 --> 01:43:16,100
A shareholder to your properties
has sprung up

755
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:24,170
He might usurp it all, you never know.
Maybe another son is at home

756
01:43:25,214 --> 01:43:28,115
Another on the waiting list,
and one more...

757
01:43:33,022 --> 01:43:34,785
Stop

758
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:39,787
Ma...? How did Ma come here?
- l called her over

759
01:43:46,635 --> 01:43:49,570
Damn! Aren't you ashamed
to pee on me?

760
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:51,873
You ought to be ashamed

761
01:43:54,476 --> 01:44:01,473
Now l know where your money goes
and where you go on holidays

762
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:07,686
Gayatri, she...
- Why didn't l drop dead?

763
01:44:08,991 --> 01:44:16,864
How foolish of me!
l worshipped you

764
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:22,769
And you...? You're producing babies
with the other woman?

765
01:44:23,205 --> 01:44:28,268
Sister, you suspect an angel?
You have gravely sinned

766
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:33,407
Don't you dare call me sister!
And of course, he's an angel to you

767
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:40,889
Yes, he's an angel to me and to
thousands of orphans like this baby

768
01:44:41,357 --> 01:44:45,191
lt is because of Mr Mahendra's help
that l rear them in my orphanage

769
01:44:47,029 --> 01:44:53,525
As for this baby, someone left him
at the gate of the orphanage last night

770
01:44:54,036 --> 01:44:57,403
l only brought him here
to show brother Mahendra

771
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:04,008
What! Good Lord!
l have gravely sinned...

772
01:45:05,047 --> 01:45:10,007
l suspected you.
Forgive me

773
01:45:11,987 --> 01:45:16,390
Sister, l've wronged you too.
Forgive me

774
01:45:17,059 --> 01:45:21,553
Not your fault. The real culprit
No problem, l'll fix him later

775
01:45:34,076 --> 01:45:38,240
He's crying. Let me hold him.
So cute!

776
01:45:40,549 --> 01:45:42,517
l approve of this alliance.
- Congratulations, Mr Sharma

777
01:45:43,285 --> 01:45:45,412
So we're related now

778
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:51,382
Mr Malhotra, let's hold the wedding
after the festival of Holi

779
01:45:52,294 --> 01:45:55,821
Hardly any time left?
1, 2, 3, 4...

780
01:45:56,298 --> 01:46:00,257
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 0...
only two days to go

781
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:15,275
''Showers of colours,
the festival of colours is here''

782
01:46:18,087 --> 01:46:21,955
Happy Holi, Puja.
- Happy Holi

783
01:46:22,925 --> 01:46:27,663
Not me. l don't play Holi.
- At least colour my cheeks

784
01:46:27,663 --> 01:46:29,494
Let me colour them

785
01:46:29,865 --> 01:46:32,959
Where's Karan?
- Karan hates colours

786
01:46:33,335 --> 01:46:36,964
Where is he?
- ln his bedroom. Some colour?

787
01:46:37,339 --> 01:46:38,806
No, no please

788
01:47:32,127 --> 01:47:34,186
Not Pinky, l'm Puja

789
01:47:38,167 --> 01:47:39,930
l thought you were Pinky

790
01:47:42,404 --> 01:47:46,033
Why are you laughing?
Am l a clown?

791
01:47:48,644 --> 01:47:52,080
This... you did?

792
01:47:53,282 --> 01:47:55,580
Don't mind. lt's Holi

793
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:01,883
''O fair lady, as your veil sways,
you blush''

794
01:48:02,291 --> 01:48:06,387
''Look behind, your lover
comes seeking you''

795
01:48:11,433 --> 01:48:16,735
''She sways and slithers...
l can't get her''

796
01:48:23,111 --> 01:48:27,070
''Naughty brat,
don't harass me...''

797
01:48:28,951 --> 01:48:30,077
''don't...''

798
01:48:30,452 --> 01:48:33,580
''don't harass me''

799
01:48:41,396 --> 01:48:42,590
Let go

800
01:48:43,165 --> 01:48:46,999
Think it over. lf you don't let go,
you'll have to hold my arm forever

801
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:20,464
''Slips... my red veil slips...''

802
01:49:21,503 --> 01:49:24,267
''sets hearts beating harder''

803
01:49:25,274 --> 01:49:30,075
''Ever since l entered youth...''

804
01:49:30,512 --> 01:49:33,481
''l've been wearing the veil''

805
01:49:34,049 --> 01:49:37,985
''My love, my veil''

806
01:49:57,539 --> 01:49:58,836
''Her veil''

807
01:50:27,536 --> 01:50:31,336
''Now l'm sixteen,
and in a bad shape''

808
01:50:35,978 --> 01:50:40,347
''Boys chase me, tease me,
harass me''

809
01:50:44,586 --> 01:50:48,215
''How do you l save myself?
Where do l hide?''

810
01:50:48,590 --> 01:50:50,854
''Oh, where do l hide?''

811
01:50:53,362 --> 01:50:58,095
''Ever since l entered youth...''

812
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:01,228
''l've been wearing the veil''

813
01:51:01,603 --> 01:51:05,562
''Yes, my love,
l've been wearing the veil''

814
01:51:09,511 --> 01:51:12,708
''My veil''

815
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:41,408
''Come, marry me,
l can wait no more''

816
01:51:45,447 --> 01:51:49,611
''Get me the bridal dress,
paint my hands in henna''

817
01:51:54,122 --> 01:51:58,183
''Get me bracelets,
marry me''

818
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,787
''Get me bracelets''

819
01:52:02,731 --> 01:52:07,725
''Ever since l entered youth...''

820
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:11,239
''l've been wearing the veil''

821
01:52:11,673 --> 01:52:15,632
''Yes my love,
l've been wearing the veil''

822
01:52:19,181 --> 01:52:22,639
''Her veil''

823
01:52:41,703 --> 01:52:44,399
You do know my daughter Puja?
- Very well

824
01:52:44,773 --> 01:52:48,470
She's one in a million.
- l know your son Aahul too...

825
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:51,679
who's one in millions.
Mr Khurana...

826
01:52:52,147 --> 01:52:55,674
l want our friendship to turn
into family relation

827
01:52:57,519 --> 01:52:59,214
So let's shake hands

828
01:52:59,788 --> 01:53:03,952
No, daddy. l can't get married to him
- Why not?

829
01:53:04,793 --> 01:53:08,194
Aahul is my friend's son.
He comes from a good family...

830
01:53:08,396 --> 01:53:12,093
which enjoys a good social status.
They're our equals

831
01:53:14,136 --> 01:53:17,697
Daddy, it isn't that.
- So what is it?

832
01:53:19,808 --> 01:53:24,302
There was someone l fell in
love with as a child, daddy

833
01:53:24,813 --> 01:53:29,716
And l've found him now.
- What childhood love? Who is it?

834
01:53:32,754 --> 01:53:35,222
Who's Karan?
- Try and recall, daddy

835
01:53:35,824 --> 01:53:40,727
You used to take me to Ooty during
my vacations every year

836
01:53:41,830 --> 01:53:48,235
There was this boy there. Karan.
- Karan! The vagabond! The orphan!

837
01:53:50,772 --> 01:53:54,538
He's no orphan, daddy. A
respectable family has adopted him...

838
01:53:54,776 --> 01:53:57,745
and give him its name.
They've made him their son

839
01:53:58,046 --> 01:54:01,538
Giving him a name or making him a son
does not change the blood in his veins!

840
01:54:03,785 --> 01:54:08,745
Daddy, Karan's love flows in my veins.
And l can't change that either

841
01:54:09,257 --> 01:54:10,747
Shut up, Puja!

842
01:54:12,394 --> 01:54:17,093
l'm your father and l'm taking the
important decisions in your life!

843
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,766
Daddy, please don't snatch
my love from me

844
01:54:21,169 --> 01:54:23,637
l've prayed for years
to have him back

845
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:26,500
l don't want to argue with you, Puja

846
01:54:29,911 --> 01:54:34,780
Listen to me very carefully. lf l
hear you utter Karan's name again...

847
01:54:35,116 --> 01:54:37,414
l'll wipe out every trace of him

848
01:54:39,888 --> 01:54:42,015
ln that case, listen to what
l have to say, daddy

849
01:54:42,224 --> 01:54:44,192
Your daughter's life lies
in Karan

850
01:54:44,426 --> 01:54:47,953
lf something happens to Karan,
your daughter won't live either

851
01:54:58,506 --> 01:55:02,408
''My beloved is dark-skinned...
to hell with the fair ones''

852
01:55:02,844 --> 01:55:06,211
''l'm good enough for him...
to hell with the fair ones''

853
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:13,514
Listen, midget. lf anyone has complaints
about food or anything else...

854
01:55:13,855 --> 01:55:16,824
l'm going to give you a beating
and reduce you to six inches

855
01:55:19,194 --> 01:55:21,162
l've brought it.
- What?

856
01:55:21,363 --> 01:55:23,331
The decorator will start
work tonight

857
01:55:24,132 --> 01:55:26,100
Here's what you'll do, son...
- Listen...

858
01:55:26,868 --> 01:55:29,564
Yes...?
- You ought to have met Mr Sharma

859
01:55:29,938 --> 01:55:32,099
Mr Sharma...? What for?
- What do you mean?

860
01:55:32,374 --> 01:55:36,834
We didn't ask him how he wanted
the wedding procession to be welcomed

861
01:55:39,014 --> 01:55:41,642
This is the last time you've
said something sensible

862
01:55:41,883 --> 01:55:44,647
The last time...?
- You need brains for a first time

863
01:55:44,886 --> 01:55:48,185
And you don't have any brains.
- What are you laughing for?

864
01:55:48,623 --> 01:55:50,591
Come with me

865
01:55:50,959 --> 01:55:54,190
Not among the ladies...
go and fetch the plates

866
01:55:54,963 --> 01:55:59,297
l told his mother that
Mr Sharma is a gentleman...

867
01:55:59,567 --> 01:56:02,866
he's not going to make any demands.
And you've honoured my word

868
01:56:03,905 --> 01:56:06,669
Mr Malhotra, you haven't had
any tea or soft drink...?

869
01:56:06,908 --> 01:56:09,206
lt's enough that you said it

870
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:31,626
Did you send for me, sir?

871
01:56:36,004 --> 01:56:39,371
Who were the two men
who were here to see you?

872
01:56:39,741 --> 01:56:42,301
lt was Mr Malhotra.
Didn't l tell you, sir...?

873
01:56:43,011 --> 01:56:46,242
l'm getting Aajesh married.
lt's with Mr Malhotra's daughter

874
01:56:46,948 --> 01:56:49,917
That boy with him... who was he?

875
01:56:50,318 --> 01:56:52,513
He's the bride's elder brother.
Karan

876
01:56:56,958 --> 01:56:59,426
What is the matter, sir?

877
01:57:27,655 --> 01:57:29,088
Seema, listen to this!

878
01:57:29,257 --> 01:57:32,158
lmpressed with the popularity of
Puja's story, our managing committee...

879
01:57:32,327 --> 01:57:34,295
has decided to make
a telefilm out of it!

880
01:57:35,997 --> 01:57:39,296
They've also decided that you will
handle the project and make the film

881
01:57:39,801 --> 01:57:41,769
Me...?
- Yes, you

882
01:57:42,003 --> 01:57:47,373
l haven't even read the story, sir.
- So go ahead and read it. Hurry

883
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:23,602
That's okay, but why are you crying?
- l'm not crying, Karan

884
01:58:26,047 --> 01:58:28,811
The Pinky from your childhood
has been found!

885
01:58:32,053 --> 01:58:34,817
Pinky...? Where is she?

886
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:38,689
Puja's your Pinky, Karan.
Look at this...

887
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:42,359
she wrote this story
only to find you

888
01:58:46,067 --> 01:58:51,027
Puja's... my Pinky?
- Yes

889
01:59:16,097 --> 01:59:18,463
Karan, my son...
- Yes, dad?

890
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:22,069
Come home immediately, son
- Why? What's up?

891
01:59:22,670 --> 01:59:27,471
Something very strange has happened.
Come home

892
01:59:28,643 --> 01:59:30,941
What happened, Karan?
- l don't know

893
01:59:31,112 --> 01:59:32,670
l've got to go home immediately

894
01:59:40,722 --> 01:59:42,087
Mom, what's happening here?

895
01:59:42,357 --> 01:59:47,090
My son, the bridal henna hadn't
even darkened on your sister's hands

896
01:59:48,630 --> 01:59:51,428
And our joys have been
struck by lightning

897
01:59:53,134 --> 01:59:56,900
Daddy, what's mother saying?
- lt's true, my son

898
01:59:57,572 --> 02:00:03,101
Mr Sharma called a little while ago,
he has turned down the marriage

899
02:00:06,681 --> 02:00:09,115
To how many people will we explain...

900
02:00:09,484 --> 02:00:13,113
why the groom's folks refused
to go ahead with the marriage...

901
02:00:13,488 --> 02:00:16,116
just a day before the wedding?

902
02:00:17,158 --> 02:00:20,127
But why did he do this, daddy?
- That's what l wanted to know...

903
02:00:20,328 --> 02:00:23,126
but he disconnected
the telephone

904
02:00:26,167 --> 02:00:29,136
All your father has earned
in his lifetime is respect, my son

905
02:00:30,171 --> 02:00:32,696
And l'm losing even that today

906
02:00:41,282 --> 02:00:43,147
Mr Sharma...

907
02:00:43,851 --> 02:00:45,944
you take a marriage for a joke?

908
02:00:46,287 --> 02:00:48,949
Because you're the groom's father
doesn't mean...

909
02:00:49,190 --> 02:00:51,750
you can play with our honour.
We are a respectable family too

910
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,485
And you have no right to
toy with my sister's life...

911
02:01:16,651 --> 02:01:19,620
lf you want to have
your sister married...

912
02:01:20,688 --> 02:01:26,923
you'll have to forget Puja.
You've got to decide this right now

913
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:31,926
Do you value your love more...
than your sister?

914
02:01:47,582 --> 02:01:49,812
l want to meet you right now, Puja

915
02:01:50,585 --> 02:01:52,553
Me...? What for?

916
02:01:53,254 --> 02:01:56,815
Today l want to tell you
how l feel

917
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:03,561
How he feels...?
l'm at the Marriot Hotel

918
02:02:04,065 --> 02:02:07,228
You can come over and meet me
at the poolside

919
02:02:15,343 --> 02:02:18,244
This is the day l've
always waited for

920
02:02:40,868 --> 02:02:44,599
''l've found the love of my life...''

921
02:02:45,106 --> 02:02:48,872
''Allah, Allah...''

922
02:02:49,377 --> 02:02:52,869
''My heart now finds peace...''

923
02:02:53,381 --> 02:02:57,283
''Allah, Allah...''

924
02:02:57,652 --> 02:03:01,281
''Spring this time
drives my heart crazy...''

925
02:03:02,056 --> 02:03:05,617
''Allah, Allah...''

926
02:03:06,227 --> 02:03:09,685
''what intoxication
takes over...?''

927
02:03:10,498 --> 02:03:13,956
''Allah, Allah''

928
02:03:36,357 --> 02:03:39,724
''l didn't tell anyone...''

929
02:03:40,361 --> 02:03:43,660
''but my heart always beat for you''

930
02:03:44,532 --> 02:03:48,332
''Without me, you were
in bad shape...''

931
02:03:48,736 --> 02:03:52,331
''and l pined for you''

932
02:03:57,378 --> 02:04:00,939
''Nowhere could l find peace,
my love...''

933
02:04:01,482 --> 02:04:05,077
''loneliness gnawed at my heart
every moment''

934
02:04:05,553 --> 02:04:09,080
''Everywhere around me...''

935
02:04:09,724 --> 02:04:13,683
''were memories of you''

936
02:04:26,073 --> 02:04:29,702
''l longed to meet you
every moment...''

937
02:04:30,411 --> 02:04:33,972
''Allah, Allah''

938
02:04:34,515 --> 02:04:37,973
''l've found the love of my life...''

939
02:04:38,519 --> 02:04:42,387
''Allah, Allah...''

940
02:05:09,083 --> 02:05:12,678
''Just one thing l prayed for
all days and nights...''

941
02:05:13,054 --> 02:05:16,615
''that we meet at the earliest''

942
02:05:17,458 --> 02:05:20,985
''May the bridal music play
at our union...''

943
02:05:21,462 --> 02:05:25,023
''may we have a bridal procession''

944
02:05:29,837 --> 02:05:33,933
''There's no one here,
except you and me...''

945
02:05:34,375 --> 02:05:37,776
''no shackles of the world
bind us anymore''

946
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:42,006
''Come, let me take you
in my arms...''

947
02:05:42,583 --> 02:05:46,451
''l can't take these
distances anymore''

948
02:05:59,066 --> 02:06:02,968
''My beloved is so very innocent...''

949
02:06:03,404 --> 02:06:06,805
''Allah, Allah, Allah''

950
02:06:07,508 --> 02:06:10,944
''l've found the love of my life...''

951
02:06:11,512 --> 02:06:15,278
''Allah, Allah...''

952
02:06:15,783 --> 02:06:19,480
''My heart now finds peace...''

953
02:06:19,921 --> 02:06:23,482
''Allah, Allah''

954
02:06:46,948 --> 02:06:49,109
l can't take it anymore, Karan

955
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:52,314
l know what surprise
you want to give me

956
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,526
Ever since l saw you at the party...

957
02:07:03,965 --> 02:07:07,264
l've fallen in love with you
- At the party?

958
02:07:07,635 --> 02:07:10,536
Yes, Puja. Your love
has driven me crazy

959
02:07:11,238 --> 02:07:13,433
l feel as if l just can't
live without you

960
02:07:18,579 --> 02:07:24,882
But... Seema told me that you live
only for Pinky, your childhood love

961
02:07:25,453 --> 02:07:28,752
l was a kid then. As a kid,
l made friends with Pinky...

962
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:31,354
we played together
and forgot all about it

963
02:07:31,726 --> 02:07:35,059
l was never in love with Pinky.
l met her as a child...

964
02:07:35,596 --> 02:07:39,362
maybe she belongs to someone else now.
And l'm not crazy, am l...?

965
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,761
to fall in love with her
without even seeing her?

966
02:07:42,003 --> 02:07:45,302
She could be fat and ugly
for all l know

967
02:07:47,608 --> 02:07:52,375
Which means you love a girl only
for her beauty... not for her heart

968
02:07:52,947 --> 02:07:56,849
Absolutely! lt's beauty you fall
in love with, because you see it

969
02:07:57,118 --> 02:08:00,747
You can't look in someone's heart
whether it's good or bad, can you?

970
02:08:01,622 --> 02:08:05,581
You're right. You can't
look in anyone's heart...

971
02:08:06,627 --> 02:08:08,595
to know how evil it is

972
02:08:13,634 --> 02:08:16,262
But why've you started crying, Puja?

973
02:08:16,971 --> 02:08:18,939
Not Puja. l'm Pinky

974
02:08:20,975 --> 02:08:24,934
Yes, the one you think is Puja
is actually Pinky

975
02:08:26,113 --> 02:08:28,741
l wish l had seen through you
as a kid...

976
02:08:28,983 --> 02:08:32,350
the one l love is not
worthy of even my hatred

977
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:37,783
What a mess! lf l knew you're Pinky,
l wouldn't have proposed at all

978
02:08:38,759 --> 02:08:41,626
But that's all right.
You're the one l love, after all

979
02:08:41,996 --> 02:08:44,794
Which is why l never separated
the token of your love from me

980
02:08:48,135 --> 02:08:51,627
No! The truth about you
has now been exposed to me

981
02:08:52,073 --> 02:08:54,405
You just can't fall in love
with someone!

982
02:08:55,509 --> 02:08:58,205
You have no right to keep
someone's token of love!

983
02:10:09,083 --> 02:10:12,052
What stuff are you made of...?

984
02:10:12,753 --> 02:10:15,722
For my sake, you won't
tell anyone about this

985
02:10:59,066 --> 02:11:01,762
Thank God, we have escaped
getting a bad name

986
02:11:02,136 --> 02:11:06,095
My son! This is a miracle.
l don't know who did it

987
02:11:06,807 --> 02:11:09,435
Mr Sharma telephoned and
apologised profusely

988
02:11:09,877 --> 02:11:13,779
Our honour has been restored.
- Go and meet Priya, son

989
02:11:14,215 --> 02:11:17,184
She just can't believe it.
Hurry up and go to her

990
02:11:29,096 --> 02:11:30,586
Brother!

991
02:11:40,374 --> 02:11:42,342
l'll be back, brother

992
02:11:53,954 --> 02:11:56,821
''Not to be offended...
it's the festival of colours!''

993
02:12:06,867 --> 02:12:10,496
Puja, we've decided to make
a telefilm on your love-story

994
02:12:10,938 --> 02:12:13,429
So quickly write the climax for it

995
02:12:13,941 --> 02:12:16,432
l'm sorry, Seema.
l can't write the climax

996
02:12:16,877 --> 02:12:20,176
Get someone else to write it.
- What...? But why?

997
02:12:20,948 --> 02:12:25,851
Seema, had l known what climax
my love-story would have...

998
02:12:26,287 --> 02:12:28,847
l wouldn't have started
writing my love-story at all

999
02:12:29,089 --> 02:12:30,750
l don't understand

1000
02:12:31,358 --> 02:12:36,853
Suffice it to say that my love-story
has ended before its climax

1001
02:12:50,044 --> 02:12:52,012
Here's everything for
the ceremony, priest

1002
02:12:52,179 --> 02:12:55,876
Sweets and fruits...
is there anything else you want?

1003
02:12:56,216 --> 02:12:59,185
No, nothing more.
- Do let me know if you need something

1004
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:01,785
Veer, where's Karan?

1005
02:13:03,023 --> 02:13:04,991
He's gone out

1006
02:13:05,359 --> 02:13:08,886
Veerji, you've been Karan's
childhood friend

1007
02:13:09,363 --> 02:13:11,331
He hides nothing from you

1008
02:13:11,999 --> 02:13:15,230
Karan and Puja have loved each
other from their childhood

1009
02:13:15,936 --> 02:13:18,461
And now, there's this problem?

1010
02:13:21,942 --> 02:13:27,574
Karan has bound me in an oath.
But l want to see him happy

1011
02:13:28,949 --> 02:13:33,249
lt's Puja's father who has
created all the problems

1012
02:13:33,687 --> 02:13:35,712
What do you mean?

1013
02:13:36,357 --> 02:13:40,919
The guy Karan's sister is marrying...

1014
02:13:41,395 --> 02:13:45,695
was educated and brought up,
thanks to Puja's after

1015
02:13:47,234 --> 02:13:50,260
His father works for
Puja's father

1016
02:13:51,038 --> 02:13:54,940
This is what Puja's father
took advantage of

1017
02:13:57,978 --> 02:14:00,276
And Karan made the sacrifice...

1018
02:14:00,981 --> 02:14:03,347
he sacrificed his love
for his sister

1019
02:14:11,492 --> 02:14:13,619
This is the truth, Puja

1020
02:14:14,995 --> 02:14:18,954
l'm proud of my love.
That Karan is such a great guy...

1021
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,764
Seema, l want to go to Karan
right now

1022
02:14:29,109 --> 02:14:31,304
What do you think my child?

1023
02:14:31,545 --> 02:14:35,709
l placed a special order with Tiffani
and Company for this necklace

1024
02:14:39,019 --> 02:14:40,782
Let's go, Seema

1025
02:14:42,089 --> 02:14:44,990
Puja, where are you going?
- To Karan. l'm walking out

1026
02:14:47,094 --> 02:14:49,790
You played dirty with me and tried
to snatch my love from me

1027
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:52,328
But now l'm going
to my love for good

1028
02:14:57,204 --> 02:14:59,001
Are you out of your mind?

1029
02:14:59,239 --> 02:15:03,005
You're leaving me and these luxuries
for that low-level life?

1030
02:15:06,046 --> 02:15:09,345
You got this swanky bungalow built
on the city's prime property

1031
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:12,610
Maybe it measures up to your level,
not mine

1032
02:15:13,053 --> 02:15:15,817
These Mercedes and Porsche cars
must belong to your level too

1033
02:15:16,123 --> 02:15:22,619
Not mine. This daughter of yours
is giving up things of your level...

1034
02:15:23,063 --> 02:15:25,031
and going to her love

1035
02:15:35,476 --> 02:15:41,437
The vows are over. You are now man
and wife in joys and sorrow

1036
02:16:04,972 --> 02:16:11,468
You shouldn't have come here, Puja.
- l've got to know the truth, Karan

1037
02:16:13,814 --> 02:16:17,079
My daddy played very dirty tricks
to separate us

1038
02:16:18,118 --> 02:16:21,610
He put pressure on Uncle Sharma and
had Priya's marriage annulled

1039
02:16:26,226 --> 02:16:31,892
For your sister's happiness, you
sacrificed the love of our childhood...

1040
02:16:32,466 --> 02:16:35,094
for which you and l have
always waited

1041
02:16:38,205 --> 02:16:43,108
Why did you do that, brother?
l could've married anyone else

1042
02:16:44,311 --> 02:16:47,109
But you wouldn't have
found your love again

1043
02:16:48,415 --> 02:16:53,614
Karan, my son...
you made such a great sacrifice?

1044
02:16:54,154 --> 02:16:57,055
My son, what debt have
you repaid me for?

1045
02:16:57,424 --> 02:17:01,724
What are you talking about, daddy?
Not even in seven lifetimes...

1046
02:17:02,162 --> 02:17:04,926
can children repay their
parents' debt

1047
02:17:05,432 --> 02:17:09,300
l didn't do anyone a favour...
l merely did my duty

1048
02:17:09,937 --> 02:17:13,134
But your sense of duty has enslaved
me to you for a thousand lifetimes

1049
02:17:13,507 --> 02:17:16,874
Not even my own son would have
made such a huge sacrifice

1050
02:17:18,178 --> 02:17:22,137
You're forgetting something, daddy.
You made me promise...

1051
02:17:22,583 --> 02:17:27,316
that l would never say such a thing.
So what makes you say it today?

1052
02:17:29,189 --> 02:17:32,158
l'm sorry, my son.
lt slipped out of my tongue

1053
02:17:43,370 --> 02:17:48,774
Bastard! You think you will
succeed in your designs?

1054
02:17:49,209 --> 02:17:52,838
Sir, l've done nothing.
- You have betrayed me!

1055
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:55,248
You are the one who
has betrayed us, daddy

1056
02:17:55,449 --> 02:17:57,178
What do you want to
achieve by all this?

1057
02:17:57,384 --> 02:17:59,181
ls this your way of giving
your daughter happiness?

1058
02:17:59,386 --> 02:18:02,514
No, you're instead snatching
her happiness from her!

1059
02:18:04,958 --> 02:18:07,188
Puja, come with me

1060
02:18:10,230 --> 02:18:11,788
Let me go!

1061
02:18:22,943 --> 02:18:24,911
Let go of me!

1062
02:18:25,345 --> 02:18:28,940
After the vows, the bride goes to her
husband's house. Not her father's!

1063
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:34,880
What rubbish are you talking...?
What vows? Which vows?

1064
02:18:37,257 --> 02:18:39,953
The vows you are
about to witness

1065
02:18:42,396 --> 02:18:44,364
Priest, solemnise the wedding

1066
02:20:01,341 --> 02:20:02,569
Karan, my son!
