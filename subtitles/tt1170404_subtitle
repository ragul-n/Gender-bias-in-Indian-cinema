Maybe a princess.

45
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,072
lf you're going to meet and see her
l'm not coming with you.

46
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,877
Look, Don't be so stubborn.

00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,221
Not because of that.

55
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,124
How many times are you going
to swear on my hand?

56
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,362

l can't understand that if you like the
girl then why don't you talk?

65
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,021
Look, listen to me

66
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,924
Groom should always look good
mannerd and shy.

67
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,901
And elders always ask the parents
for girl's hand in marrige.

68
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,503

Why should we waste our time?

110
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,679
Photo is worth nothing.

111
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,281
Photo can be deceiving.

112
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,048

You told me not to tell you my
name so l told his.

138
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,329
Now if he wants, he can tell my

00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,125
Take it off.

140
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,070

Who else is in your family?

142
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,081
Hey bastard.
What are you doing?

143
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,219
Close the gate.

144
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,014
You said, Take it all off.

145
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,257

00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,381
Rane is a widower since 30 years.

156
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,453
lt's not strange that a widower for
30 years started hitting on young girls.

157
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,660
How did this trophy came here?

158

Kids?

169
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,318
Didn't get time for that?
She took off at the wedding.

170
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,282
Atleast she was saved.

in a bit.

175
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,167
What are you looking?
Stand up straight.

176
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,312

ls ACP here?

178
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,785

00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,456

185
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,293
No,

186
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,363

187
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,261

189
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,010
Your old nieghbour.

190
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,381
Vicky's older sister, man.

191
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,418
Bhawani!

192
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,749
You ran away with the peon in collage,
your family brought you back.

193
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,090
What man?
Don't say it out loud.

194
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,551
Don't worry?
We won't tell anyone.

195
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,203
Are you here to file a complaint?

196
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,777
Just tell me the name.

197
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,710

198
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,645
Sister, No complaint.
l came here to get him out.

199
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,121
What's your relation with him?

200
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,321
Relation...

201
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,885
He's my cook.

202
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,390
He went to get vegetables in the
morning, l heard police have caught him.

203
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,464
And this nakes fellow.

204
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:48,869
l don't know him.

205
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,097
What?

206
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,870
You don't know me!

207
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,211
That much l know,
He cleans my toilet.

208
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,574
Sister, Let go of the cook.

209
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,276
How can l?

210
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,186
F.l.R has been filed.

211
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,182
Sister, l'll starve to death.

212
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,216
Nowadays you can get a father,
but not cook.

213
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,723
Okay,
Cook is free to go.

214
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,258
But, Shall l put this hald naked in
the lockup?

215
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,459
Make him do 200 sit ups.

216
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,072
Hang him upside down.

217
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,511
Go,
But...

218
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,915
Don't let me see you again in
front of the collage?

219
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,811
Rane, you're leaving me here...
Hey, stand right there.

220
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:49,591
lf l start quickly, l'll be free quickly.
So l can go with them in the car.

221
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,994
You've come in the police jeep,
You'll go in the ambulance.

222
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,369
Get started.

223
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,669
Now.

224
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,277
Thank god it came to my mind that
you're not my father, you're my cook.

225
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,623
l could've lost my respect in front
of Bhawani.

226
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:20,123
But, What the use of shouting at you?
lt's my fault.

227
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,623
Thinking that l have only one father.

228
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,628
l've raised you with too much love.

229
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,638
How many times l told you that
it was all Mathur's fault?

230
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,909
And how many times have told to
stop being friends with him?

231
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,210
What happened?
Cat got your toung?

232
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,856
Bapu, lf you don't know then
let me tell you.

233
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,395
Good friendship is which makes
people proud.

234
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,655
For example Gandhi and Nehru.

235
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,306
Each of them making the other
one proud.

236
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,873
l'm not saying that you should
become great like them.

237
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,276
But, day by day you're going in
the wrong direction.

238
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,983
What if l started going in
the wrong direction?

239
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,682
You should understand atleast one thing.

240
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:23,124
You started seeing me when you turned
26, but l'm looking at you since l was born.

241
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,620
Means my expereince is greater.

242
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,267
Sit

243
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,797
Sit right there.

244
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,603
l said sit.

245
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,207
l'm not done yet.

246
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,908
l'll get back to you.

247
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,150
Mudhu Uncle, didn't see you all day.

248
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,493
l went to south africa, couldn't get on
the train so l took the auto rikshaw.

249
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,659
What happened to you?
Accident?

250
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,124
Shut up

251
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,524
l can't even abuse you on your
father.

252
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,795
Because your father is my best friend.

253
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,469
Go and call him.
l want to talk to him.

254
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:09,996
You can't see him.

255
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,745
l'm trying to save him from bad
influence.

256
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,076
Then, what are you doing here?

257
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:17,773
What?

258
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,617
When we were in london,
your father Janardhan Rane...

259
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,950
...was a fun to be with, he got
croupted right when you were born.

260
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,886
Rane.
Not on step, l'll break your leg.

261
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,297
Did you do the same with your father?

262
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:37,863
Yes

263
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,307
And if you try to bring that boquete of
friendship here again...

264
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,379
...then l'll call Bhawani and have you
arrested again.

265
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,377
Out.
Rane, You've lost your son.

266
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,518
Do you know who was here just now?

267
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,184
Best friend.

268
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,528
Go ahead.
go with him

269
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,065
Let's give Bhawani a duty today.

270
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,526
l won't let go today.

271
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,936
l'll break your head.

272
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,872
Brother, you!

273
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,272
What's the drama?

274
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,345
He's holding a stick in his hand,
will you get it once he hits you.

275
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,540
l thought that Madhu Uncle came back
to meet Bapu.

276
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,231
Rupali!
Had to come.

277
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,758
lt's hard to hide my face in my own
house because of what people are saying.

278
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,533
What happened?

279
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,040
Why are you quiet now?

280
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,504
Speak.

281
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,469
Hold on

282
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,169
We know about you relatives
and their ranks.

283
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,502
Whatever was seen was right.
But lt wasn't what it seemed.

284
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,374
Police wasn't arresting him,
They were giving him a lift.

285
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,577
By hold his collar,
By dragging him.

286
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,511
She wasn't holding his coller,
she was hugging him.

287
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:36,780
You know who's our new ACP?
Bhawani Bhagmar.

288
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,456
Daughter of Mohammad Uncle.

289
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,758
Bhawani

290
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:50,457
Don't think l'm a fool,
You father and son can fool anyone.

291
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,192
Come if you want,
l'm going.

292
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:55,864
Brother.

293
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:01,174
Please don't get along with Mathur Unlce,
He always gets Bapu in trouble.

294
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,651
Mannu came on work today?

295
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,046
Mannu

296
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,990
Where were you yesterday?

297
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,924
My grandmother died.

298
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,529

So, you've forgotten my voice.

No it's not like that,

No one names Rose studied with me.

337
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,504
And now l'm busy,

a underwear is enough for a
guest like you

740
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,310
talking rubbish in front of girl.

741
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:35,545

sorry Uncle, to made Gorav fool, dont

if you would need and other drama
to made him fool i would be in.

749
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,016
yes you would do that, but something
is burning inside.

750
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,175
Oh.. my milk, be right back.

751
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:15,051
why you scare Bapu, why dont you
get some one for work?

752
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:20,018
you ask that by youself, he is
everything since i was very little.

753
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:26,602
sit, his law is what ever is going to
his son;s bally would be his.

754
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,062

whatever its too much, your mother?

756
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,840
since i was born, then why Bapu
didnt remarry?

757
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,307
everyone forced him but Bapu was
scared of step mother.

758
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:47,319
anyways, you are so lucky that you
got that kind of father.

759
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,183

son like me?

760
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,765

1167
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:22,890
he is gone old, some thing stupid
is cooking in his brain.

1168
01:48:24,764 --> 01:48:26,163
he is hiding some thing.

1169
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:28,557

when i introduce them..

1180
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:06,334
They were looking each other,
Both were amazed.

1181
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:10,101
Why Bappu will amaze?
When common people met each other

1182
01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:11,869
they don't behave like this.

1183
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:14,940
l am telling you something's between
them.

1184
01:49:16,316 --> 01:49:19,683
Bappu was trying to impress teacher.
l won't say that.

1185
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:24,653
But after marriage your fashionable
clothes are gone, his hair whitnenss

1186
01:49:24,824 --> 01:49:25,188
gone and he was dancing in home
like Shammi Kapoor.

1187
01:49:28,762 --> 01:49:33,165
My Bappu!
Listen! l think it's like that.

1188
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:36,035

She is just my Anu.

1274
01:57:40,987 --> 01:57:45,947
We were born in same village.

1275

We grown up to play together.

1276
01:57:52,432 --> 01:57:55,959
School bags were on our shoulders
then we decided that

1277
01:57:56,602 --> 01:57:59,196

Bappu's mistake?

1355
02:08:08,047 --> 02:08:12,074
He never left your village because he
never see you marry with someone else.

1356
02:08:14,586 --> 02:08:15,416
l agree that

1357
02:08:16,822 --> 02:08:20,781
l don't have much experience of life
but l know one thing

1358
02:08:22,261 --> 02:08:25,094
that everything is already written in
his book.

1359
02:08:26,598 --> 02:08:30,193
Bappu didn't sleep me in cot but
on his shoulders.

1360
02:08:30,903 --> 02:08:33,804
He still keeps me near like l am
his heart.

1361
02:08:36,241 --> 02:08:37,299
So much love.

1362
02:08:39,144 --> 02:08:40,668
l can't never give him back.

1363
02:08:43,315 --> 02:08:44,976
And without your yes,
Never.

1364
02:08:46,985 --> 02:08:49,351
because you are the only present
for my Bappu.

1365
02:09:21,987 --> 02:09:25,252
Hello!
Gaurav! Me!

1366
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,518
l think teacher didn't sleep whole
night.

1367
02:09:29,661 --> 02:09:32,323
Her room's light was on till morning.

1368
02:09:33,732 --> 02:09:36,496
After that she came to my room and
says,

1369
02:09:37,369 --> 02:09:39,929
What?
Shall we meet and talk?

1370
02:10:02,427 --> 02:10:04,861
l knew that she will defintely say
Yes.

1371
02:10:04,997 --> 02:10:07,830
l was just asking to God all night.

1372
02:10:08,734 --> 02:10:11,828
What a news, l just tell to Baapu.

1373
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:15,472
Gaurav!

1374
02:10:26,752 --> 02:10:27,377
What?

1375
02:10:31,857 --> 02:10:34,451
l want to tell you one more thing
from my side.

1376
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:41,194
Tell him that in his son's heart he
lot of love to his Baapu.

1377
02:10:42,234 --> 02:10:46,694
and ask him that from that love

1378
02:10:47,105 --> 02:10:50,370
can l get a little piece of cake.

1379
02:10:54,746 --> 02:10:58,546
Because l really like his son.

1380
02:11:23,876 --> 02:11:26,709
Where you've been?
You always told me your plans.

1381
02:11:27,079 --> 02:11:30,048
l called mall, mobile is in home and

1382
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:33,583
l am talking to you.

1383
02:11:43,228 --> 02:11:46,356
Come on, first eat your breakfast
what l made for you.

1384
02:11:46,531 --> 02:11:49,659
then start dancing.
What nonsense you wrote?

1385
02:11:50,402 --> 02:11:52,233
You wrote a message of love on air.

1386
02:11:53,705 --> 02:11:56,697
These kind of poets hung up on air.

1387
02:11:57,042 --> 02:11:58,942
like fan.

1388
02:11:59,077 --> 02:12:03,173
lf you want to get some real thing
then Gaurav's presence is necessary.

1389
02:12:03,615 --> 02:12:08,746
ln the climax, before the curtains
down.

1390
02:12:09,755 --> 02:12:14,590
Mr. Jaanu and Miss. Anu is going to
meet each other.

1391
02:12:15,127 --> 02:12:18,688
Listen! lt's not a game of dolls.
l know.

1392
02:12:18,864 --> 02:12:21,332
lt's a game old people what childrens
have to play.

1393
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,698
Before elders get their decisions
and childrens have to agree that.

1394
02:12:25,904 --> 02:12:30,500
But time has changed, Now childrens
will decide and elders will obey.

1395
02:12:32,511 --> 02:12:34,536
l think you've gone mad,
Yes!

1396
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:40,784
Shikha told me, that teacher is agree

1397
02:12:59,171 --> 02:13:02,902
Baapu!
Shikha also said that

1398
02:13:05,210 --> 02:13:07,838
Baapu!
May l tell you?

1399
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:11,808
Yes!
She also said that

1400
02:13:14,052 --> 02:13:16,486
l have lot of love for you in my
heart.

1401
02:13:19,024 --> 02:13:20,958
l mean, she said that.

1402
02:13:22,194 --> 02:13:24,628
And then she ask that

1403
02:13:26,098 --> 02:13:29,693
Can she take a little share of love
too.

1404
02:13:37,776 --> 02:13:39,607
May l?
Really?

1405
02:13:46,785 --> 02:13:48,013
Not a little share.

1406
02:13:50,322 --> 02:13:51,380
Give her your complete heart.

1407
02:14:13,578 --> 02:14:14,340
Sit down

1408
02:14:19,017 --> 02:14:21,918
You know by that l'm Shikha's Dad.

1409
02:14:23,822 --> 02:14:27,656
l'm going to Tokyo for a bussiness.
Before coming here...

1410
02:14:28,026 --> 02:14:29,459
...Talked to Shikha on the phone.

1411
02:14:30,262 --> 02:14:32,662
She said that l should come here first.

1412
02:14:33,298 --> 02:14:34,424
lt's important.

1413
02:14:36,701 --> 02:14:38,862
l asked her what is it?
But she didn't say anything.

1414
02:14:45,143 --> 02:14:47,907
Now l know that you were that
important thing.

1415
02:14:57,923 --> 02:14:59,185
You're educated.

1416
02:14:59,791 --> 02:15:02,885
You're succesfull bussiness.
Nice family.

1417
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:07,826
After seeing you,
l'm impressed even more.

1418
02:15:13,038 --> 02:15:14,767
What more l should praise you?

1419
02:15:15,607 --> 02:15:19,737
There's not even a small chance of
saying no to my daughter.

1420
02:15:23,548 --> 02:15:26,949
Look, l forgot to have breakfast
while waiting for you.

1421
02:15:27,419 --> 02:15:28,977
Come on let's eat something.

1422
02:15:30,455 --> 02:15:31,752
You stay here.

1423
02:15:32,124 --> 02:15:35,252
We'll know eachother better
while having breakfast.

1424
02:15:39,231 --> 02:15:45,466
lt's been 20 years l'm in America,
But still a punjabi from inside.

1425
02:15:45,804 --> 02:15:49,433
l've always been in love with my
culture and land.

1426
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:50,699
Sit

1427
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:56,037
l don't like the culture and lifestyle
over there.

1428
02:15:58,183 --> 02:16:00,344
First they have children then they
get married.

1429
02:16:17,369 --> 02:16:18,666
What will you have?
No, l just had breakfast.

1430
02:16:38,223 --> 02:16:39,349
l am what l am.

1431
02:16:41,193 --> 02:16:45,755
So you tell me that how can l give
my daughter's hand in a family...

1432
02:16:46,231 --> 02:16:48,722
...where her father in law himself
is going on a honeymoon.

1433
02:16:57,175 --> 02:16:59,336
lf you want you can have your
father married.

1434
02:16:59,744 --> 02:17:02,110
lt's your choice.

1435
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:06,439
But then stop hoping that Shikha
will come back to you after studies.

1436
02:17:07,018 --> 02:17:08,918
l'll have to say no to her.

1437
02:17:09,621 --> 02:17:10,679
That's my choice.

1438
02:17:12,691 --> 02:17:15,717
And please it's better if this discussion
stays between us.

1439
02:17:16,161 --> 02:17:18,129
Shikha shouldn't know about it.

1440
02:17:19,564 --> 02:17:22,931
You'll have to respect a father's
selfishness.

1441
02:17:24,803 --> 02:17:26,134
Reason is clear.

1442
02:17:26,438 --> 02:17:30,738
lf Shikha finds out, She might not
agree to come with me.

1443
02:17:32,677 --> 02:17:35,805
Then l won't have any other option.

1444
02:17:37,749 --> 02:17:40,411
and l'll have to talk to your Bapu.

1445
02:17:43,822 --> 02:17:46,256
l'll have to talk to Anuradha too.

1446
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:51,395
And l don't think that by breaking
Shikha's relationship...

1447
02:17:51,796 --> 02:17:54,924
...Anuradha would even think about
her own marriege.

1448
02:17:56,534 --> 02:17:57,228
What do you think?

1449
02:18:03,208 --> 02:18:04,266
l'm just saying.

1450
02:18:05,443 --> 02:18:07,843
lt's all for your own good.

1451
02:18:10,382 --> 02:18:11,872
You have to make the decision.

1452
02:18:13,251 --> 02:18:14,912
Whose happiness is more important
to you?

1453
02:18:15,654 --> 02:18:16,279
Your own.

1454
02:18:17,055 --> 02:18:18,215
Or your Bapu's.

1455
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:24,851
l just have my only daughter.

1456
02:18:41,046 --> 02:18:43,276
What were you talking about?

1457
02:18:44,916 --> 02:18:47,908
Nothing.
Then why the long face?

1458
02:18:48,853 --> 02:18:50,013
No, lt's nothing like that.

1459
02:18:50,822 --> 02:18:53,484
Whenever l'm happy my face is
just like this.

1460
02:18:55,794 --> 02:18:58,888
You're the first man in the world
whose face is like that in happiness.

1461
02:19:00,098 --> 02:19:03,465
Do you know? what l do when
l'm happy.

1462
02:19:23,755 --> 02:19:27,020
Please come with me,
My father is calling me.

1463
02:19:33,798 --> 02:19:37,825
So all of you are here,
Are you cooking a surprise for kids?

1464
02:19:38,236 --> 02:19:40,636
Not for kids.
The discussion is about the elders.

1465
02:19:41,039 --> 02:19:42,666
He's worst than kids.

1466
02:19:43,708 --> 02:19:45,972
How ashamed we're feeling because
of you.

1467
02:19:46,845 --> 02:19:48,312
lt's you personal matter, but.

1468
02:19:48,947 --> 02:19:50,039
Who are we to say anything?

1469
02:19:53,385 --> 02:19:55,319
lt's all out our understanding.

1470
02:19:56,988 --> 02:19:59,252
How come you want to get married
in this age?

1471
02:19:59,557 --> 02:20:01,457
People are saying things.

1472
02:20:01,893 --> 02:20:03,155
How can we bare this?

1473
02:20:16,808 --> 02:20:18,969
Rupali one minute, listen to me.

1474
02:20:19,644 --> 02:20:21,271
He didn't even think about my
daughter.

1475
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:23,270
Don't know where did that evil
woman came from?

1476
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:27,707
She gave a wave,
And he fell for her.

1477
02:20:28,987 --> 02:20:31,649
What interest could she have in
60 year old man?

1478
02:20:32,056 --> 02:20:33,683
She's only interested in your wealth.

1479
02:20:34,859 --> 02:20:38,124
But he's fallen for her looks,
He's gone blind.

1480
02:20:38,997 --> 02:20:41,659
l won't let go off my daughter's
hand so easily.

1481
02:20:42,167 --> 02:20:42,758
l'm telling you.

1482
02:20:43,001 --> 02:20:44,662
People go for prayers at this age.

1483
02:20:45,170 --> 02:20:45,932
Not honeymoon.

1484
02:20:46,371 --> 02:20:47,770
lt's not nice.

1485
02:20:48,339 --> 02:20:50,637
You better not insult us like this.

1486
02:20:53,812 --> 02:20:54,836
Aren't you ashamed?

1487
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:58,114
You are son of your father,
before you became her husband.

1488
02:20:59,717 --> 02:21:01,014
How could you let this happen?

1489
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:06,522
l was with the kids,
l didn't know what was going on.

1490
02:21:06,825 --> 02:21:07,757
But l know.

1491
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:09,956
That what is going on in your
wife heart?

1492
02:21:12,063 --> 02:21:12,791
Bapu's new realtionship,
Means one more heritor.

1493
02:21:15,934 --> 02:21:17,492
She just thinking about that.

1494
02:21:19,337 --> 02:21:21,567
To hell with what she thinks,
Because l don't want anything.

1495
02:21:22,006 --> 02:21:23,303
l ready to write it down.

1496
02:21:23,475 --> 02:21:25,773
But, Someone playing with Bapu's
happiness...

1497
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:28,879
...l won't tolerate it.

1498
02:21:33,885 --> 02:21:35,580
Why fight because of me?

1499
02:21:37,155 --> 02:21:40,147
l'm also hurt because of it,
But there's also truth in their thinking.

1500
02:21:41,593 --> 02:21:44,255
She's a mother of a daughter,
and l'm her grandfather.

1501
02:21:49,968 --> 02:21:53,665
How can l be happy after ruining
their happiness?

1502
02:22:07,051 --> 02:22:08,382
l should've thought about it.

1503
02:22:11,155 --> 02:22:13,555
No Bapu, This decision will not change.

1504
02:22:14,325 --> 02:22:17,453
This relation is back on track after so
much trouble, Don't break it.

1505
02:22:17,762 --> 02:22:20,026
say whatever you want.
l'm not with you now.

1506
02:22:20,331 --> 02:22:22,731
And no one will talk about this
in this house anymore.

1507
02:22:34,279 --> 02:22:37,407
What are you doing?
Sleeping, usless man.

1508
02:22:38,583 --> 02:22:40,050
ls it true?
What l heard.

1509
02:22:40,952 --> 02:22:42,613
That your line broke.

1510
02:22:43,388 --> 02:22:44,753
Now let me go for it.

1511
02:22:45,356 --> 02:22:46,914
l'll be her groom.

1512
02:22:47,592 --> 02:22:49,321
When l saw her the first time.

1513
02:22:49,994 --> 02:22:51,393
l fell in love with her.

1514
02:22:52,096 --> 02:22:54,792
But l stayed quiet because you're
my friend.

1515
02:22:55,266 --> 02:22:58,463
lt's good that you backed off,
You can't handle her.

1516
02:22:59,737 --> 02:23:03,537
What if the fish is not in the net,
But it's still in our own pond.

1517
02:23:03,675 --> 02:23:06,143
Whenever you want to see the
fish, you can come to my house.

1518
02:23:06,444 --> 02:23:10,540
And just peak from the gate and
thats it.

1519
02:23:10,882 --> 02:23:11,906
Shut up.

1520
02:23:12,684 --> 02:23:13,673
You don't understand.

1521
02:23:13,985 --> 02:23:14,815

1522
02:23:15,186 --> 02:23:17,245
What is your son to me?

1523
02:23:17,488 --> 02:23:18,955
Son of my friend.
Meaning...

1524
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:20,286
My own son.

1525
02:23:20,825 --> 02:23:23,885
Just like this, What would be my
wife to you? Friend's wife

1526
02:23:24,062 --> 02:23:25,859
Meaning...
You're own sister.

1527
02:23:28,166 --> 02:23:31,329
Look, You older son has brought
me this proposal.

1528
02:23:31,603 --> 02:23:34,663
You were first in the line so
came for your permision.

1529
02:23:34,839 --> 02:23:35,931
Do whatever you want.

1530
02:23:50,521 --> 02:23:51,988
Go, get out from here.

1531
02:23:53,057 --> 02:23:54,718
l'll kill you if stay one more minute.

1532
02:23:55,126 --> 02:23:57,458
l can understand your anger.

1533
02:23:57,629 --> 02:23:59,256
l'm not blaming you.

1534
02:23:59,631 --> 02:24:02,156
But, My fisrt wedding card.

1535
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:18,704
What if you also think of love
like Bapu?

1536
02:25:21,679 --> 02:25:23,647
l don't want to live like another
teacher.

1537
02:25:25,616 --> 02:25:26,674
l'm sorry Gaurav.

1538
02:25:43,868 --> 02:25:45,165
Hindi is enough.

1539
02:25:45,603 --> 02:25:48,094
What do you say brother in law?
Hindi is enough, Right?

1540
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:52,475
You've written so much poetry.

1541
02:25:52,877 --> 02:25:54,811
Write a invitation.

1542
02:25:58,883 --> 02:26:00,976
People should just come draging.

1543
02:26:05,523 --> 02:26:08,253
See, What did l tell you?
See, how mad is he.

1544
02:26:08,693 --> 02:26:10,524
Look, l wanted...

1545
02:26:11,362 --> 02:26:14,092
...that you should come with me
when l go to see the girl.

1546
02:26:14,999 --> 02:26:17,832
But, He and his wife started babling.

1547
02:26:21,405 --> 02:26:23,805
l went to meet her this morning
at her house.

1548
02:26:24,175 --> 02:26:26,837
At Anu's.
Anu told me...

1549
02:26:27,111 --> 02:26:29,978
...that there's no need to
look and see process.

1550
02:26:30,248 --> 02:26:34,014
Enough. l just want to get married
as soon as possible.

1551
02:26:34,519 --> 02:26:37,352
She's was looking hot in yellow
sari.

1552
02:26:40,391 --> 02:26:41,119
Because...

1553
02:26:41,959 --> 02:26:43,586
That people are talking from
everywhere.

1554
02:26:45,363 --> 02:26:47,297
What else would she do?

1555
02:26:48,666 --> 02:26:50,964
That's why she said that
Mathur...

1556
02:26:51,335 --> 02:26:53,667
or anyone else.
Wedding should happen.

1557
02:27:04,549 --> 02:27:07,109
l even bought saris for the wedding.

1558
02:27:10,454 --> 02:27:13,890
And this is his wife's choice.

1559
02:27:14,392 --> 02:27:17,088
But not until you tell me your choice...

1560
02:27:17,395 --> 02:27:19,295
...How can l give sari to Anu?

1561
02:27:19,964 --> 02:27:21,591
Tell me which one do you like?

1562
02:27:21,933 --> 02:27:22,661
Tell me.

1563
02:27:23,467 --> 02:27:25,196
Tell me which one would
look good?

1564
02:27:26,370 --> 02:27:28,804
lf you ask me,
This one will look best on her.

1565
02:27:45,690 --> 02:27:49,524
We're not getting out of the room
not even for a day.

1566
02:27:55,533 --> 02:27:56,625
Tell me which l should l pick?

1567
02:27:57,468 --> 02:27:59,698
Okay, close your eyes and put your
finger on one.

1568
02:28:05,877 --> 02:28:07,469
Take this all away and get out
from here.

1569
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:10,012
You're not worth it.

1570
02:28:10,982 --> 02:28:13,951
Only l have the right to call her Anu.

1571
02:28:15,453 --> 02:28:17,785
Now get out of my house.
What are you saying?

1572
02:28:18,222 --> 02:28:20,315
You backed off, that's why he came.

1573
02:28:20,958 --> 02:28:22,448
Which right are you talking about now?

1574
02:28:22,693 --> 02:28:25,787
Look, You, your wife, your family.

1575
02:28:25,963 --> 02:28:28,625
each one of them are stupid.
Can't understand what's in my heart.

1576
02:28:28,933 --> 02:28:31,458
But l will get married.
l won't back off now.

1577
02:28:33,938 --> 02:28:34,962
You've changed.

1578
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:37,064
Are you in your sences?

1579
02:28:39,210 --> 02:28:42,043
You're not going to change your
decision again, Right?

1580
02:28:43,147 --> 02:28:44,079
Never

1581
02:28:46,083 --> 02:28:48,779
You call Shikha,
call her.

1582
02:28:49,287 --> 02:28:53,053
She left with a sad face,
l don't want you to lose her.

1583
02:28:53,591 --> 02:28:54,489
Call her.

1584
02:28:55,526 --> 02:28:56,857
l'm right here, Bapu.

1585
02:28:58,896 --> 02:29:00,523
l didn't go anywhere.

1586
02:29:09,206 --> 02:29:12,642
Forgive me friend.
To have you say yes.

1587
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:15,174
All of us played.

1588
02:29:55,486 --> 02:29:57,351
Have you lost your mind?

1589
02:29:58,255 --> 02:29:59,882
How can you even think...

1590
02:30:00,224 --> 02:30:02,784
That your Anu would marry someone
else.

1591
02:30:11,068 --> 02:30:13,195
We didn't even let her find out.

1592
02:30:13,604 --> 02:30:14,502
That you've said no.

1593
02:30:15,373 --> 02:30:16,567
What if she would done something?

1594
02:30:19,143 --> 02:30:21,475
Would l join my line by cutting your
line.

1595
02:30:21,946 --> 02:30:23,208
Shame on such a friendship.

1596
02:30:25,783 --> 02:30:26,306
What do you say?

1597
02:30:38,662 --> 02:30:42,928
She's going day after tommorow,
Let's get you married before that.

1598
02:30:45,903 --> 02:30:46,995
Forgive me, Bapu.

1599
02:30:47,905 --> 02:30:49,270
l listened to Rupali.

1600
02:30:50,508 --> 02:30:52,442
But after seeing Gaurav l became
strong.

1601
02:30:53,811 --> 02:30:57,269
So, Father and son has made me
guilty now.

1602
02:30:58,282 --> 02:31:01,445
You go home, l'll talk to you there.
l am going home.

1603
02:31:01,919 --> 02:31:02,851
But my mother's.

1604
02:31:03,788 --> 02:31:05,221
And taking the kids with me.

1605
02:31:05,990 --> 02:31:08,686
Everythings is right over here,
Stop interfering.

1606
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:10,859
Who am l to interfere?

1607
02:31:11,362 --> 02:31:12,920
l'll come in father in law's wedding.

1608
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:20,329
Every one is illitrate.
Get out of here.

1609
02:31:25,276 --> 02:31:26,470
Why did you do that?

1610
02:31:26,944 --> 02:31:29,310
l did what l was suppose to long ago.

1611
02:31:29,814 --> 02:31:32,009
Either she'll come to her sences
or l'll lose mine.

1612
02:31:38,856 --> 02:31:40,187
Who are the witnesess?

1613
02:31:40,958 --> 02:31:41,947
Sign here.

1614
02:31:53,104 --> 02:31:55,004
You and Shikha would have first...

1615
02:31:55,539 --> 02:31:56,767
No my father...

1616
02:31:57,108 --> 02:31:58,006
...you're first.

1617
02:31:59,977 --> 02:32:02,309
Everybody stand in line.
Happy Photo.

1618
02:32:07,485 --> 02:32:09,180
Hurry up,
l'll miss my flight.

1619
02:32:09,854 --> 02:32:12,220
l missed half of my life in search
of a wife.

1620
02:32:12,356 --> 02:32:14,415
You're worried about your flight.

1621
02:32:14,792 --> 02:32:16,089
And rest of the life...

1622
02:32:16,393 --> 02:32:18,554
...We'll be great.

1623
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:22,463
l've found a girl.
l used to go look for a girl...

1624
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:23,667
...and found her.

1625
02:32:24,135 --> 02:32:29,129
We spent so much time together at the
station that we started knowing eachother.

1626
02:32:32,676 --> 02:32:33,870
That's my girl.

1627
02:32:49,493 --> 02:32:51,427
Sorry Daddy,
l'm a little late.

1628
02:32:58,335 --> 02:33:00,895
This is my daddy.
and daddy this is Gaurav's Bapu.

1629
02:33:03,574 --> 02:33:05,303
Congratulation.

1630
02:33:06,810 --> 02:33:08,744
Her mom will be amazed when
she'll find out.

1631
02:33:11,015 --> 02:33:14,212
You're waiting here, We found out
when Shikha told us in the car.

1632
02:33:17,321 --> 02:33:20,757
We're going to Dehli first then
a connecting flight from there.

1633
02:33:26,363 --> 02:33:30,527
Now we should decide about our
kids.

1634
02:33:31,569 --> 02:33:35,005
Most important is to decide about them.

1635
02:33:35,773 --> 02:33:37,866
But before that l need to speak with
Gaurav.

1636
02:34:01,532 --> 02:34:05,229
You love your Bapu more than my
daughter.

1637
02:34:06,036 --> 02:34:06,593
Right?

1638
02:34:09,707 --> 02:34:11,538
l don't know how to choose between love.

1639
02:34:13,277 --> 02:34:14,244
lt's just that...

1640
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:17,470
By losing Bapu's happiness...

1641
02:34:18,315 --> 02:34:19,577
...l don't want anything for myself.

1642
02:34:21,552 --> 02:34:23,213
What you've lost?

1643
02:34:23,621 --> 02:34:25,885
You won't know the sorrow of it
just now...

1644
02:34:26,757 --> 02:34:27,746
All life.

1645
02:34:31,462 --> 02:34:32,724
l'm not going lose anything.

1646
02:34:34,832 --> 02:34:35,457
You'll lose.

1647
02:34:38,602 --> 02:34:39,466
Do you see that?

1648
02:34:44,842 --> 02:34:47,367
lt's because she doesn't know anything.

1649
02:34:48,445 --> 02:34:51,278
But after she finds out about it
in America.

1650
02:34:53,017 --> 02:34:54,951
Then you won't see that smile on
her face.

1651
02:34:56,053 --> 02:34:57,042
She'll know.

1652
02:34:57,755 --> 02:34:59,620
That how much pain is in
the heart.

1653
02:35:00,491 --> 02:35:02,721
lf l let her go without telling her
anything.

1654
02:35:04,161 --> 02:35:07,426
Then your play will go
upside down.

1655
02:35:08,632 --> 02:35:09,894
She'll come right back to me.

1656
02:35:10,868 --> 02:35:13,336
You think that l'll give her the
permision to to that.

1657
02:35:14,104 --> 02:35:16,095
She won't need anyone's permision.

1658
02:35:17,174 --> 02:35:18,300
lf the love is true.

1659
02:35:19,109 --> 02:35:21,134
Then nobody can separate the lovers.

1660
02:35:22,246 --> 02:35:24,339
And you can see the living example
in front of you.

1661
02:35:25,015 --> 02:35:26,107
My Bapu and Teacher.

1662
02:35:27,251 --> 02:35:29,651
l'll do what Teacher did.

1663
02:35:30,554 --> 02:35:32,613
l'll wait for Shikha all my life.

1664
02:35:33,991 --> 02:35:35,822
lf my love is true.

1665
02:35:36,393 --> 02:35:39,521
You can take her overseas and
lock her up.

1666
02:35:40,397 --> 02:35:41,421
She'll come back.

1667
02:35:45,002 --> 02:35:47,266
How can you be so sure?

1668
02:35:48,639 --> 02:35:50,197
You know how much she loves you.

1669
02:35:51,575 --> 02:35:54,100
But how much she loves her daddy.

1670
02:35:54,712 --> 02:35:56,373
Do you even know about that?

1671
02:35:57,981 --> 02:35:59,312
lt's useless to measure that.

1672
02:36:00,484 --> 02:36:01,849
Just need to trust your love.

1673
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:03,345
l trust my love.

1674
02:36:05,789 --> 02:36:07,086
Whole life is ahead.

1675
02:36:08,625 --> 02:36:09,887
Let's see, what happens.

1676
02:36:20,771 --> 02:36:21,465
So tell me.

1677
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:24,202
What have you decided?

1678
02:36:26,343 --> 02:36:27,503
l was proud.

1679
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:32,643
That l almost have the whole world.

1680
02:36:35,786 --> 02:36:38,016
But today l'm so jealous of you.

1681
02:36:39,923 --> 02:36:40,719
Beacause.

1682
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:45,525
l don't a son like Gaurav.

1683
02:36:51,468 --> 02:36:54,096
For a girl whose known for a
moment.

1684
02:36:54,805 --> 02:36:58,468
lf you would broken the heart of
your father, l would've been hurt.

1685
02:37:00,244 --> 02:37:02,906
You've changed the meaning of love
for me.

1686
02:37:06,483 --> 02:37:07,950
What were you saying?

1687
02:37:08,652 --> 02:37:11,382
You'll wait for Shikha whole life.

1688
02:37:13,323 --> 02:37:15,883
l won't let you wait for even a
moment.

1689
02:37:16,727 --> 02:37:19,093
She's yours.

1690
02:37:19,797 --> 02:37:20,695
Take her.
