1
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,967
This land wasn't always
so scorched..

2
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:38,834
..barren and parched.

3
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:40,765
There was a time..

4
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:44,206
..when clouds used
to roam here too.

5
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:48,168
And this land use to
be covered in green.

6
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,266
Crops used to grow here.

7
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:51,868
Flowers blossomed too.

8
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:56,065
And then one day a big
sin took place here.

9
00:02:56,471 --> 00:03:00,965
People say two lovers weren't
allowed to meet by the locals.

10
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,769
Their sacred love was called
sin and they were killed.

11
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:08,363
The day two innocents' blood
fell on this ground..

12
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,835
..the greenery of the
land turned pale.

13
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,795
Because clouds stopped
passing from here.

14
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,894
Plants withered.

15
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:19,827
Wells dried up.

16
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:22,838
And the green land turned barren.

17
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,929
Colonies were deserted.

18
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,367
People migrated to other places.

19
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,172
Now besides these old faces..

20
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:34,702
..and hopeless eyes,
nothing lies here.

21
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:38,298
These people keep looking
at the sky..

22
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:40,969
..in hope that a cloud..

23
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,171
..might bring rain..

24
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,736
..and the scorching land
might get some water.

25
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:02,395
I'll be back.

26
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:04,802
Where are you going?

27
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:06,929
Kunwar, do you see the temple?

28
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:10,342
A big sage lives here.
Thakur Baba.

29
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,035
Nobody passes from here without
seeking his blessings.

30
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:17,339
Listen to me.
You took seek his blessings.

31
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:21,139
What bloody nonsense, Sarju!
I don't believe in this.

32
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,154
What are you saying?
He's a accomplished sage.

33
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:25,477
He may be.

34
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,343
You can go.

35
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,977
Okay, sir.

36
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:37,949
Strange! Even today people
believe in these things.

37
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:40,310
Go away, fly!

38
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:50,761
Whenever I get life..

39
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:59,719
..I wish to get your
love every time.

40
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:08,519
..I wish to get your
Love every time.

41
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:21,117
Whenever I get life..

42
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:30,387
..I wish to get your
Love every time.

43
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:39,219
..I wish to get your
Love every time.

44
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,777
Suraj.

45
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,877
Who is there?

46
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:30,384
I never saw you earlier.

47
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:33,126
Sage, he's Kunwar.
He came with me.

48
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:35,620
But how did he come up?

49
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:05,891
You? You're Suraj.

50
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,082
Suraj.

51
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:10,859
Suraj, you've returned?

52
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:13,386
You returned to forgive us.

53
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,904
Please forgive us, Suraj.

54
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:20,313
What are you doing? I'm not Suraj.
You're mistaken.

55
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:22,906
No.. you're Suraj.

56
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:26,042
My old eyes can't be mistaken.

57
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,074
I've been waiting
for you for long.

58
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,940
I'm alive for this day.

59
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:33,974
Where is my Devi?

60
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:35,899
Devi?

61
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,776
Yes, my child.

62
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,437
If you're here,
why didn't she come?

63
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:42,277
Where did you leave her?

64
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:46,173
She promised me to come
back with you.

65
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,475
Where is my daughter? -Sir..

66
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,679
..I don't understand you.

67
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:53,874
I'm not Suraj.

68
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,915
My name is..
-Sage, he isn't what you think.

69
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,981
Let's go. -You're Suraj.

70
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,289
Suraj! Son.. don't leave me.

71
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:08,733
Tell me, where is my daughter?
Suraj! -Sage has lost his mind.

72
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:10,781
Sarju, I had told you all
this was nonsense.

73
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:12,436
Why was the sage calling me Suraj?

74
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,833
Sir, he's an accomplished sage.
He keeps ranting such things.

75
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,676
We can't understand them.

76
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,976
Shut up! This is 21st century
and yet you believe all this.

77
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,466
Ridiculous! Drive home!

78
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,938
Rana, my horse ate your rook.

79
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:33,113
Didn't anyone tell you that
horse is vegetarian.

80
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:37,473
If you even touch my rook,
you'll lose.

81
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,816
When we play we friends,
we're not alert.

82
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,180
I've lost to a friend.

83
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:46,197
So it makes no difference.

84
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:47,457
Greetings, brother.

85
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:49,397
Bless you. -Has Kumar come?

86
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:52,996
Why do you care?
You keep playing chess.

87
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,834
You should've been chess' father
instead of Kumar's father.

88
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:57,898
You should've thought of it.

89
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,232
Her majesty! Queen of my heart.

90
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:05,031
I've only arena of chess
to win and lose.

91
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:07,332
I'm a Rajput (warrior).
I can't quit fighting.

92
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,865
Son is coming,
not a Mughal army to prepare.

93
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,262
You go. I'll finish the game.

94
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:26,651
Mother.

95
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:27,756
Bless you, son!

96
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,693
What's this education
that won't end!

97
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:35,130
Mother craves to see
her son's face.

98
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:37,757
I've finished my studies.
I'll stay with you now. Okay?

99
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,663
Come in, son.

100
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:42,989
After many days..

101
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:44,922
Daddy.

102
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:46,022
Come, Kumar.

103
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,606
Bless you. -Greetings, uncle.

104
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:51,059
Bless you, son.
You made us wait very long.

105
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,352
I got bored of your studies.

106
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:54,831
Neha too is getting bored.

107
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:56,056
Come on, uncle.

108
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,357
Neha can bore others
not get bored.

109
00:09:58,941 --> 00:09:59,818
Hi, everybody.

110
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:00,922
She's here.

111
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,206
So the prince charming is here.

112
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:06,667
Can I ask,
why did you come so late?

113
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,122
Actually..

114
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:09,838
I've asked Sarju.

115
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,093
Neither there was flat
tyre nor accident..

116
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:15,064
..nor engine trouble.

117
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:18,828
Correct. But I came late to
escape from your rambling.

118
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,899
This is called check and mate,
child Neha.

119
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:25,106
No, dad. You're sadly mistaken.

120
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,579
He's tying to make light
of the matter.

121
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,429
I won't let it happen.

122
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,239
Why didn't you reply
to my last letter?

123
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,437
So what?

124
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:35,388
Let them fight. Let's go to study.

125
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:37,885
Bring chess there. -Come.

126
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:39,483
Son. You sit.

127
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,232
I'll get tea for you. -Okay.

128
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:43,997
Kumar. -Yes?

129
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,366
Tell me,
did you've any affair there?

130
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,285
I went to study..

131
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,696
..not for an affair.

132
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,198
Show me your suitcase. -Why?

133
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,468
Because since childhood you make
pictures of every you like.

134
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:00,385
I want to see..

135
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:03,176
..in four years how many pictures
of girls you made.

136
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,386
I neither made pictures of girls..

137
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,025
..nor of a tree.

138
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:10,355
I know you don't lie.

139
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,889
So I accept it.

140
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:14,871
So tomorrow you'll
make my portrait.

141
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,697
Okay, dear. Don't chew my brains.

142
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:23,663
Do you know when were in school..

143
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:26,307
..a photographer came to
take our group photo.

144
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:29,398
I kept making him laugh.

145
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,103
And he was getting so furious.

146
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:35,567
How long will I've to
sit like this, Kumar?

147
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,538
I've been sitting for an hour
and half. I'm bored.

148
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:40,721
Is this pose right?

149
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:43,597
Say something. Such concentration!

150
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,770
I think you're making
a master piece.

151
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,840
Tell me,
how do I look in your painting?

152
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,232
I can't sit for so long.

153
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,336
You didn't even look at me.

154
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:00,999
How are you making the portrait?
Let me see.

155
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,104
What did you make? Who is she?

156
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:11,425
Kumar.
Kumar.. whose portrait is this?

157
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,139
This..

158
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,839
Whose portrait did I make?

159
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,396
You made it and you don't know.

160
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:26,331
Are you kidding me?

161
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,439
No, Neha. I'm telling the truth.

162
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:30,903
I don't know how this happened.

163
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,371
I was making your photo.

164
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:36,896
So..

165
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:46,039
A gypsy waits for you.

166
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:54,814
When will you come, O traveller?

167
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:07,911
A gypsy waits for you.
When will you come, O traveller?

168
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:18,376
When will you come, O traveller?

169
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:23,808
Everyone has come except you.

170
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:37,302
When will you come, O traveller?

171
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:12,236
Is your county in
a faraway land?

172
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,867
Didn't you get my message?

173
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,205
Is your county in
a faraway land?

174
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:24,298
Didn't you get my message?

175
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:33,365
O prince charming!
Come without delay.

176
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:46,675
When will you come, O traveller?

177
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:25,548
I fear someone else might
take my palanquin.

178
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:35,226
I fear someone else might
take my palanquin.

179
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:40,972
I will die suffering.

180
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:47,802
When will you come, O traveller?

181
00:15:48,299 --> 00:16:07,754
A gypsy waits for you.
When will you come, O traveller?

182
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:47,345
You have shattered my dream.
You've left me pining.

183
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:54,354
You have shattered my dream.
You've left me pining.

184
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:03,475
Even the flowers feel
like embers.

185
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:16,801
When will you come, O traveller?

186
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:23,284
When will you come, O traveller?

187
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:28,127
Everyone has come except you.

188
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:41,364
When will you come, O traveller?

189
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:45,807
Reshma.

190
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:47,718
Reshma, where did you go
early morning? -Why?

191
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,254
Father is worried.
He was looking for you. Come.

192
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,777
Where did you go?

193
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:58,014
I was looking for you
since morning.

194
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:00,879
Don't go like this.

195
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:04,317
You know I get restless if
you're not in front of me.

196
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,183
What's there to be worried,
father?

197
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,350
If you mother had been alive,
it would've been different.

198
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:11,411
Let it be, father. Come.

199
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:15,120
Chief, why do you get so
worried for Reshma?

200
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:20,152
You know, Ambika, Reshma has
nightmare every Full Moon night.

201
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,570
And today is Full Moon night.

202
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:26,880
Ambika,
you know witchcraft and astrology.

203
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,007
Why can't you tell me
why this night..

204
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,710
..is so terrible for Reshma?

205
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:32,716
I don't understand anything,
chief.

206
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,117
We're going to Udaipur tomorrow.

207
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:37,888
A sorcerer will come
just Jaisalmer.

208
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:39,459
We'll take Reshma to him.

209
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,428
No. No, Ambika.

210
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,634
We're going to a shrine.

211
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,888
Gypsies from all over the
countries will come.

212
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:50,185
I don't want to create a scene
regarding my daughter.

213
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:54,876
I trust God. He'll cure her.

214
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,716
I wish this night passes
peacefully.

215
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:30,094
Come, O beloved!

216
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:01,196
Child! What happened, child?

217
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:04,622
Again the same dream, father!

218
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:09,438
What's enmity Full Moon
night has with me?

219
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,946
Nothing, child. Why fear dreams?

220
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:15,870
When you wake up, dreams vanish.

221
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:19,911
Why can't you see anything?

222
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:23,374
I think, chief, it's because
of some spirit.

223
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,312
Let's take her to Udaipur
to that sorcerer.

224
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:29,040
No, I don't trust them.

225
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:32,774
Not while going to Udaipur..

226
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,043
..but while returning we'll surely
going to Thakur Baba.

227
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:40,005
I think with his blessing,
Reshma will be cured.

228
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,774
We'll leave in the morning.

229
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:42,414
Welcome. Please sit.

230
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:48,115
Hail Bhawani! -Hail Bhawani!

231
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:50,041
Chief Dongar Singh. How are you?

232
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:54,906
Manik Singh, this is burden
of loyalty of 400 years..

233
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,180
..how long will you carry it?

234
00:21:57,846 --> 00:22:01,009
Chief, we're only wandering..

235
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:03,277
..so that people can know..

236
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:06,143
..there used to loyalty
too in this county.

237
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,237
That's why we meet every year
on this festival day.

238
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,881
People of Rana dynasty are
still grateful to us.

239
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,078
Because when elder Rana
was in trouble..

240
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:19,905
..our ancestors had helped him.

241
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:21,677
This is our identity.

242
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:25,840
The day we lose this identity,
we'll be lost too.

243
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,877
Come! Come, daughter! Serve here.

244
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:36,436
Bless you.

245
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:40,270
Come.

246
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,743
Come, chief. Sit down.

247
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:48,933
Manik Singh.

248
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,401
Is she Reshma?

249
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,795
Yes.

250
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:55,192
She has grown so big.

251
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:58,199
Did you think of her marriage?

252
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:03,103
I think.. but my daughter is ill.

253
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,592
So how can I make her
daughter-in-law of some tribe?

254
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,291
What's her illness?

255
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:11,132
It can't be called illness.

256
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:16,393
On Full Moon night she
sees a terrible dream.

257
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:19,126
And that dream troubles
her whole month.

258
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,934
Listen to me. Get her married.

259
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,532
All her illness will be cured.

260
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,894
I'm ready to get my son Shakti
Singh married to her.

261
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,792
I'll take everything in the dowry.

262
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:37,166
What are you thinking, chief?

263
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:38,728
Don't you know..

264
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:42,132
..his son had killed a lion
with his bare hands once.

265
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,995
So he was named Shakti
(power) Singh.

266
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:48,168
It'll be an honor for me too.

267
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,029
But.. Reshma will decide
about her marriage.

268
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,097
Listen.. send Shakti Singh
to my tent tomorrow.

269
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,396
They'll meet and our work
will become easy.

270
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,514
I'll send him tomorrow morning.

271
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:26,269
Greetings, chief. -Bless you.

272
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:28,768
I'm Shakti Singh.
Chief Dongar Singh's son.

273
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,895
Father sent me to you.

274
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,466
Yes, come in and have
some refreshments.

275
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:37,834
Chief, I'm here to meet Reshma.

276
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:38,991
Where is she?

277
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,494
Reshma will come too.
Please sit first.

278
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:47,661
Where did she go early morning?

279
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:56,402
A gypsy waits for you.

280
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:05,433
When will you come, O traveller?

281
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:15,836
A gypsy waits for you.

282
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:29,177
When will you come, O traveller?

283
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:34,227
Everyone has come except you.

284
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:48,208
When will you come, O traveller?

285
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:30,534
You fool!

286
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,891
How dare you sit on this chair!

287
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:35,434
You didn't recognize me.

288
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:37,991
Why would I know a fool like you?

289
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,225
Get up from chair.

290
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,231
Listen.. -Keep the grapes down.

291
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:44,464
Look, you're insulting me.

292
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:46,831
What else should I do?
Welcome you?

293
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:49,326
How did you come here
from playing cards?

294
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,290
Cards? -Yes.

295
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,091
Don't you look like a joker?

296
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:54,820
Get lost.

297
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,959
Don't talk rubbish.
Do you know me? -Who are you?

298
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,532
I'm chief Dongar's son..

299
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,164
..and to be son-in-law
of this tribe..

300
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:03,525
..Shakti Singh.

301
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,286
Fool!
My father won't marry his only..

302
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,433
..daughter to a fool like you.

303
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,097
Will you get lost or..

304
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,161
Reshma! Stop.

305
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,867
What are you doing, daughter?

306
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,100
I'll kill him, father.

307
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,953
He dared to sit on your chair
and smoke your pipe.

308
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:25,498
Chief.. look..
-Daughter, I had invited him.

309
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:28,523
I wanted you two to know
each other well.

310
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:30,600
So that I can talk of
your marriage? -What?

311
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:34,126
You found only this rat for me?
-Rat?

312
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,438
I had killed lion with
my bare hands.

313
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,420
What are you saying?

314
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,081
I'm abusing. I can't say it
loudly in front of father.

315
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,353
You can abuse as much as you want.

316
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:52,439
But when you'll come to
my tribes as my wife..

317
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,106
..I'll see how you abuse me.

318
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:55,828
Bye, sir. -Bless you.

319
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,418
This money wants to get married.
-Monkey?

320
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,314
Daughter.. -Of course.

321
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,572
Where did your son go early
morning? -He must be around.

322
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:06,846
He's here.

323
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,415
Good morning, dad.
-Good morning, son.

324
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,147
Where did you go early morning?

325
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,647
A strange thing happened.

326
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:16,417
When I woke up in the morning..

327
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:18,643
..I heard a girl singing
beautifully.

328
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:21,877
I felt as if the voice
was calling me.

329
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:26,039
I went out following her voice.

330
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,848
So did you find the voice?

331
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:31,290
No, when I reached there the
girl was missing. -Strange!

332
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:35,311
In this age everyone
hears such voices.

333
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,977
But you shouldn't run after them..

334
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:40,347
..but make them run after you.

335
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,419
I think you're missing
your youth..

336
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,285
Many gypsies have come here.

337
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:49,881
She must be a gypsy girl.

338
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,039
They sing very well. -Really?

339
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,917
Their voice has soul
of our desert.

340
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:56,819
Why did the gypsies come here.

341
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,552
They come here every year
from far away land..

342
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,886
..to celebrate the birthday
of elder Rana.

343
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:04,813
We too join their celebration.

344
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,314
In the ground opposite to
idol of elder Rana..

345
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,013
..there is a function of gypsies.

346
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,180
You too come with us.

347
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,311
Me? I'm going out today.

348
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:18,215
I've no time for such useless
programs. -Don't say that, son.

349
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:21,455
They come from far.
They respect us so much.

350
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,618
It's our duty to participate
in their program.

351
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:25,880
But dad.. -If not in the day..

352
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,383
..there is a dance
program at night.

353
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,042
You're especially invited.

354
00:29:30,122 --> 00:29:32,989
We all should go there.

355
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:34,413
Okay.

356
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:49,426
We change attires..

357
00:29:53,022 --> 00:30:01,293
We change attires,
we change land, but not hearts.

358
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:09,228
We don't change hearts.

359
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:19,893
We are gypsies! We're gypsies!

360
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:29,620
Come..

361
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:39,397
Come to me.

362
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:50,796
We're gypsies!

363
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:56,521
We change attires,
we change land..

364
00:31:56,955 --> 00:32:03,326
..but we don't remove the
one in our hearts.

365
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:08,551
We change attires,
we change land..

366
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:46,797
After many years this
day has come..

367
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:57,955
..when I saw you,
I remembered something.

368
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:09,297
A very old story..
which I had forgotten.

369
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:22,690
A very old saga..
which I had forgotten.

370
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:32,824
We change names,
we change glasses..

371
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:42,053
..but we don't remove the
one in our hearts.

372
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:47,925
We change attires,
we change land..

373
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:36,326
Strange face of the past..

374
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:42,790
..isn't more unknown.

375
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:54,065
A gypsy has come for a trade.

376
00:34:54,155 --> 00:35:04,474
Days and nights change..

377
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:13,255
..but we don't remove the
one in our hearts.

378
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:19,398
We change attires,
we change land..

379
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:03,865
Friends meet and separate.

380
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:10,345
This world keeps going round.

381
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:21,028
Love doesn't know
life and death.

382
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:34,749
For many lifetimes,
I've wandered in your lanes.

383
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:39,335
Colors and seasons change..

384
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:45,505
We don't change hearts.

385
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:58,869
Colors and seasons change..

386
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,804
Wow, son! Very good.

387
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:15,833
Come here, daughter.

388
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,065
Bless you.

389
00:37:24,787 --> 00:37:25,732
You sing very well.

390
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,535
What's your name?

391
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:29,801
Ah.. Reshma..

392
00:37:34,594 --> 00:37:36,484
Take this. -What is it, landlady.

393
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,672
Your prize. Take it.

394
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:07,391
What are you doing, Neha?

395
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:09,543
I too a surprised!

396
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,999
This portrait and that gypsy
girl are mysteries for me.

397
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,288
How did you make the portrait
without seeing the girl?

398
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:16,131
I'm asking the same
question to myself.

399
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:18,125
Look at this portrait.

400
00:38:18,568 --> 00:38:20,468
The face is the same,
but it's not of a gypsy girl.

401
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:22,132
These jewelries and clothes..

402
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,361
Whose portrait is this?

403
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,129
I don't know.

404
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:26,259
You're lying.

405
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:30,195
I never lie, Neha.

406
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:36,868
The day I find the truth of the
portrait, I'll tell you first.

407
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:38,492
Remember it!

408
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:45,492
You're looking very happy today.

409
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:48,835
Reshma.

410
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:51,500
Who told you to dance with
Kunwar yesterday?

411
00:38:53,368 --> 00:38:55,836
I don't need anyone's
permission to dance.

412
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:56,993
You need it.

413
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,026
Now you won't do anything
without asking me.

414
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:02,228
Why? Are you a policeman?

415
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,826
We're getting married.

416
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:07,130
Really? He wants to marry me.

417
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:10,166
Have you seen your face
in the mirror?

418
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:14,921
Ambika.

419
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:17,970
Chief,
look how happy Reshma looks today!

420
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:21,937
Yes.
But this happiness is short lived.

421
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:23,325
Why?

422
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:25,699
Today is Full Moon night.

423
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:29,198
Reshma will see the same
nightmare tonight.

424
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:32,863
And then she'll be in
the same condition.

425
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:13,092
Father.

426
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:15,692
Father.

427
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:21,067
Father.. it's morning. -Morning?

428
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:23,630
Yes.
Morning of the Full Moon night.

429
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:26,821
I slept soundly all night.
-I had no nightmares. -Really?

430
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:29,517
Father, I'm free from the custody
of that nightmare.

431
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:31,155
Thanks a lot, God!

432
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:32,259
Reshma.

433
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:35,927
Do you know Goddess Bhavani had
freed you from this nightmare?

434
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,170
Go to the temple and take
Goddess' blessings.

435
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:40,825
Hurry.

436
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:01,692
Hey..

437
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:13,467
Hey.. your clothes got dim.
-Forgive me, daughter.

438
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:15,367
No.. it's not your fault.

439
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:17,098
It's the fault of the driver.

440
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:18,867
Are you Reshma?

441
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:22,228
You were singing with my son
in yesterday's function?

442
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:24,118
Come with me.

443
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,429
I'll give you some
clothes to change.

444
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,520
No.. I'll change at my tent.

445
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,558
It means you didn't forgive me.

446
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,122
No, it's not so.

447
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:34,187
But father must be waiting for me.

448
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:37,592
Tell her father she's
going with me.

449
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:39,428
My car will drop her to the camp.

450
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:40,860
Okay, landlady. -Come.

451
00:41:40,962 --> 00:41:41,986
Take this.

452
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:46,159
Let's go.

453
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:02,858
You recognized Kunwar.

454
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,456
Why won't I recognize him?

455
00:42:06,017 --> 00:42:07,357
Just yesterday..

456
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:09,658
..he was dancing so
merrily with you.

457
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,557
Come, daughter.

458
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:15,355
Come inside, daughter.

459
00:42:39,795 --> 00:42:41,194
This doesn't suit you.

460
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:44,188
Not even they..

461
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,254
Yes.. this will be fine.

462
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:51,791
It will suit you very nicely.
Wear this.

463
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:58,353
Wear these too.

464
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:00,257
No, please..

465
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,953
Child, wear them. You'll look
very beautiful in them.

466
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:05,546
Wear them. I'll be back.

467
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:26,859
Turn around, Kunwar.
I want to change.

468
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,294
What are you looking at, Kunwar?

469
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,855
Didn't you recognize me?

470
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:55,656
Why not?

471
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:59,121
I couldn't think I would
find you here.

472
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,253
You're saying as if you were
looking for me for years.

473
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:05,509
And when you found me
you were amazed.

474
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:07,187
Can I say something?

475
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,385
I was making my friend's portrait.

476
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,157
You won't believe it.

477
00:44:12,695 --> 00:44:15,452
No.. I'll believe you.

478
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,957
I hadn't seen you.

479
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:19,952
When the portrait was complete..

480
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:21,384
..it wasn't of that girl..

481
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:23,171
..but yours.

482
00:44:24,008 --> 00:44:24,697
Me?

483
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:28,008
Yes.
But you weren't in gypsy attires.

484
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,805
I gave her these clothes, son.

485
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:33,661
You've totally changed.

486
00:44:34,277 --> 00:44:37,212
Kumar,
can anyone say she's a gypsy?

487
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,973
I'm gypsy, landlady.

488
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:42,297
When I'll change my clothes
in my camp..

489
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:44,347
..I'll be the same gypsy.

490
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,230
Okay, goodbye.

491
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,505
Wait. Our driver will drop you.

492
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,844
Mother, driver isn't there.

493
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,500
I'll drop her on my way.

494
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:53,901
Come.

495
00:44:53,981 --> 00:44:55,001
Bye, aunt.

496
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:02,968
Come.

497
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:34,835
Why do you keep staring me?

498
00:45:36,877 --> 00:45:38,174
Do you dream?

499
00:45:40,006 --> 00:45:41,308
Everyone dreams.

500
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:43,905
I'm talking of those dreams..

501
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:46,140
..which are special..

502
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:50,015
..and which keep repeating.

503
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:52,804
No. I don't have such dreams.

504
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:55,303
So how did you make my portrait?

505
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,319
I wanted to ask you.

506
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,834
Me? -Yes.

507
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:00,769
When I never saw you..

508
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:02,443
..so how did I make the portrait?

509
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,275
When I saw you in the function..

510
00:46:04,677 --> 00:46:05,803
..I was surprised.

511
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:09,530
I too was surprised to see
you in the function.

512
00:46:10,252 --> 00:46:11,134
Why?

513
00:46:12,677 --> 00:46:15,874
Because since childhood I
used to get one dream.

514
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,937
And only you used to
be in that dream.

515
00:46:19,412 --> 00:46:21,711
Me? In your dreams?

516
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:23,338
Yes.

517
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,175
When I saw you in the function..

518
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,373
..I never had that dream.

519
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:34,015
Strange! I made your portrait
without seeing you..

520
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:38,477
..and you used to dream of
me without seeing me.

521
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:42,005
What does that mean?

522
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,406
Who are you? Who am I?

523
00:46:47,982 --> 00:46:50,882
How did we lose our identities?

524
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:52,312
Why and when?

525
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,139
If we had known..

526
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:56,404
..you wouldn't have made
my portrait..

527
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,981
..and I wouldn't have
seen you in dreams.

528
00:47:10,014 --> 00:47:13,711
Reshma, did your feel bad?

529
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,934
About what?

530
00:47:15,014 --> 00:47:16,743
I sang and danced with you.

531
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:18,371
No.

532
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,812
And people of your tribes?

533
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:21,178
Who cares for them?

534
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:23,347
Wow! You're very brave.

535
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,199
I'm chiefs daughter.

536
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,998
Yes, it shows.

537
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:28,131
Tell me..

538
00:47:28,506 --> 00:47:32,170
..when I woke up one morning
I heard the girl singing.

539
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,139
When I went t the garden behind
the palace, nobody was there.

540
00:47:35,307 --> 00:47:37,241
But tomorrow when I
heard your voice..

541
00:47:37,943 --> 00:47:39,497
..it felt you were the one.

542
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:42,107
Yes, I was singing that day.

543
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:45,133
I'm singing that song
since I got mature.

544
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:48,260
But now I don't need to. -Why?

545
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,864
Why did you sing the song?

546
00:47:51,903 --> 00:47:53,031
To wait for someone.

547
00:47:53,506 --> 00:47:54,531
What happened now?

548
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:56,897
I think..

549
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:59,270
..my wait is over.

550
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:00,864
Whose wait?

551
00:48:01,877 --> 00:48:02,997
You don't know.

552
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:04,531
No.

553
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:11,464
Yours.

554
00:48:30,314 --> 00:48:32,071
Whom did you come to drop, Kunwar?

555
00:48:32,555 --> 00:48:33,431
Why do you care?

556
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:34,701
I care.

557
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,731
Girls of our tribes
aren't so cheap..

558
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:40,337
..that you can take them
around in your car.

559
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:41,999
You're mistaken.

560
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:43,501
I just came to drop her.

561
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,870
Henceforth Reshma shouldn't be
seen in this car. Got it?

562
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,764
Why?

563
00:48:53,873 --> 00:48:54,897
Do you own her?

564
00:48:55,707 --> 00:48:58,369
Even you don't own her.

565
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:03,039
I don't want to see your jeep
even close to her shadow.

566
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:05,038
Shut up and move aside!

567
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:07,169
Or else I'll throw you
out of the city.

568
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:08,331
Really?

569
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:09,906
Try it.

570
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,326
Come and touch me.

571
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,893
Stay within your limits.

572
00:49:12,973 --> 00:49:14,393
Have you gone mad?

573
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,064
Don't you know sir?

574
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:17,769
Forgive me, sir.

575
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:19,271
He doesn't know you.

576
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,729
Come to the tent, fool!
What happened to you?

577
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:26,794
You can't control a girl.

578
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,262
What else can you do in life?

579
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:29,491
What can I do, father?

580
00:49:30,031 --> 00:49:32,465
Whenever I talk to her,
she gets furious.

581
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:34,822
You've killed lion
with bare hands.

582
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,295
But you get scared of her
anger and you flee!

583
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:42,092
There is a difference between
a girl and a lion.

584
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:45,732
What does Reshma have?
What's so special about her?

585
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:47,129
You don't know..

586
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:49,731
..but she's own pearls
and diamonds.

587
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:52,091
Her father has a huge treasure.

588
00:49:52,765 --> 00:49:54,824
He has priceless diamonds
of old times.

589
00:49:55,431 --> 00:49:58,298
You can get them as dowry
if you marry Reshma.

590
00:49:58,831 --> 00:50:03,268
Then we'll make a palace bigger
than that of this Rana..

591
00:50:04,198 --> 00:50:05,358
..and live with pride.

592
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:07,765
Son, work hard.

593
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:09,722
Don't lose Reshma.

594
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:11,994
Or else you'll repent forever.

595
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:22,360
Today my Reshma looks
like a princess.

596
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:25,056
Where are you coming from?
-The palace.

597
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:26,486
Palace? -Yes.

598
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,865
And these clothes?
-Landlady gave them.

599
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:31,228
She's very nice. -It's true.

600
00:50:31,663 --> 00:50:32,993
I understood it yesterday..

601
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:36,099
..when she gave you her necklace.

602
00:50:36,898 --> 00:50:38,763
Who does this these days?

603
00:50:39,765 --> 00:50:42,063
But the happiness on
your face isn't..

604
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:44,122
..just because of these clothes.

605
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:49,112
I think there is some
other secret too.

606
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:50,335
Tell me.

607
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:52,409
I came to tell you that secret,
Ambika.

608
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:53,998
What's the secret?

609
00:50:54,078 --> 00:50:57,514
The one whom I used to see
in my dream is Kunwar.

610
00:50:58,331 --> 00:50:59,131
Kunwar?

611
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:00,303
Yes.

612
00:51:01,078 --> 00:51:03,239
I recognized him when I saw him.

613
00:51:04,245 --> 00:51:07,271
But.. today when I saw
him in the mansion..

614
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,276
..and he came to drop me here..

615
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:14,410
..I felt as if I know
him for years.

616
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:18,039
Then he told me something..

617
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:20,779
..which puzzled me.

618
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:22,978
You too won't believe it.

619
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:24,872
Really? What is it?

620
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:28,113
Without meeting me he
made my portrait.

621
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:29,973
Your portrait? -Yes.

622
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:31,235
He too is amazed..

623
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,479
..on how he made it
without seeing it.

624
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,844
What does this mean, Ambika?

625
00:51:36,144 --> 00:51:37,169
I don't know.

626
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:38,969
Let me think.

627
00:51:39,845 --> 00:51:40,903
Let me see.

628
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:43,745
The man who used to come
in your dreams..

629
00:51:44,178 --> 00:51:45,202
..is Kunwar.

630
00:51:46,178 --> 00:51:49,011
After seeing him,
you don't get that dream.

631
00:51:50,044 --> 00:51:53,208
And without seeing you,
he made your portrait.

632
00:51:54,347 --> 00:51:55,872
There is some story behind it.

633
00:51:57,011 --> 00:51:59,502
An incomplete story of your union.

634
00:52:00,587 --> 00:52:03,972
I think you both are
made for each other.

635
00:52:04,645 --> 00:52:05,968
No power of this world..

636
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:08,039
..can separate you now.

637
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:42,050
In the lanes of heart,
you rule for long.

638
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:52,716
I still have a faint
recollection.

639
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:01,396
It was you ages ago,
and you still are..

640
00:53:02,037 --> 00:53:11,379
I still have a faint
recollection.

641
00:53:11,846 --> 00:53:17,441
In the lanes of heart,
you rule for long.

642
00:53:18,143 --> 00:53:28,156
I still have a faint
recollection.

643
00:53:50,125 --> 00:54:00,556
I have made a portrait
from my old memories.

644
00:54:00,945 --> 00:54:06,198
The past has been full
of separation.

645
00:54:06,278 --> 00:54:12,649
There is still your thoughts
in my heart.

646
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:22,310
I still have a faint
recollection.

647
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:51,889
When will we belong to
each other, beloved?

648
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:56,910
We've met and separated
many times..

649
00:54:58,324 --> 00:55:02,641
..but this time we'll unite.

650
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:09,007
Our love is immortal.
Do you remember this?

651
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:19,235
I still have a faint
recollection.

652
00:55:52,859 --> 00:56:02,912
Breaking all the hurdles and
traditions of the world..

653
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:13,753
Breaking all the hurdles and
traditions of the world..

654
00:56:14,555 --> 00:56:23,986
..this season of vows
have come back.

655
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:33,414
Cage of sorrow has been
shattered to free love birds.

656
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:43,413
I still have a faint
recollection.

657
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:49,049
In the lanes of heart,
you rule for long.

658
00:56:49,376 --> 00:56:55,107
It was you ages ago,
and you still are..

659
00:56:55,724 --> 00:57:01,447
I still have a faint
recollection.

660
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:05,777
I still have a faint
recollection.

661
00:57:06,185 --> 00:57:14,617
I still have a faint
recollection.

662
00:57:15,483 --> 00:57:19,507
I still have a faint
recollection.

663
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:29,468
What's this? I think a very
big storm is about to come.

664
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:32,731
Don't worry.
It will stop after a while.

665
00:57:46,665 --> 00:57:48,326
What's a terrible storm!

666
00:57:49,225 --> 00:57:51,261
I feel suffocated.

667
00:57:54,882 --> 00:57:56,793
Please pull over.

668
00:57:59,748 --> 00:58:02,262
Let's go to that old mansion.

669
00:58:14,205 --> 00:58:16,426
Is anyone in? -Open the door.

670
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:19,027
Open the door, please.

671
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:21,625
Can we stay here until
the storm calm downs?

672
00:58:28,036 --> 00:58:29,390
The storm is fierce.

673
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,876
I think he's dumb.

674
00:58:43,744 --> 00:58:44,938
What are you doing, sir?

675
00:58:45,777 --> 00:58:46,971
I'm like your daughter.

676
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,035
I'm thirsty.

677
00:58:51,768 --> 00:58:53,336
Sir, can we get a glass of water?

678
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:02,904
This palace must've
been grand once.

679
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:07,253
He lives alone in this
deserted mansion.

680
00:59:12,502 --> 00:59:14,278
We'll leave when the storm stops.

681
00:59:18,877 --> 00:59:19,844
Thank you.

682
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:25,801
What?

683
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:29,544
What does he want to say?

684
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:30,635
I don't know.

685
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:39,968
It's me.

686
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,098
Sir, whose portrait is this?

687
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:46,102
How is it possible?

688
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:52,042
It's just the way I made
without seeing you.

689
01:00:05,364 --> 01:00:07,229
The portrait I made, Reshma..

690
01:00:08,215 --> 01:00:10,858
..wasn't of yours
but of this girl.

691
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:13,955
Is it possible..

692
01:00:14,497 --> 01:00:16,863
..that who aren't the girl
of the portrait..

693
01:00:17,302 --> 01:00:21,323
..I'm not the one you
saw in your dreams.

694
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:25,366
No, Kunwar. I used to see
only you in my dreams.

695
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,364
There is a secret behind this.

696
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,864
Maybe this storm has
brought us here..

697
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:36,496
..so that we see this portrait..

698
01:00:37,064 --> 01:00:38,704
..and search for our identities.

699
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:44,155
I'm scared, Kumar.

700
01:00:44,904 --> 01:00:48,899
What's this place?
And where is that man?

701
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,490
Girja, what is the matter?

702
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:06,060
What do you want to say?

703
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:09,188
Mansion.

704
01:01:10,703 --> 01:01:12,023
I didn't understand.

705
01:01:14,766 --> 01:01:16,023
I didn't understand.

706
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,155
What?

707
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:25,862
Devi has come.

708
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:28,430
Our daughter has come?

709
01:01:30,431 --> 01:01:32,262
Suraj is also along.

710
01:01:33,464 --> 01:01:37,025
I knew they'll surely
come one day.

711
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:40,994
Thank you, God!

712
01:01:41,737 --> 01:01:44,833
Now my sins will be atoned.

713
01:01:45,297 --> 01:01:47,060
I'll get salvation.

714
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:52,460
Let's go.
I'll meet my daughter after years.

715
01:01:52,866 --> 01:01:54,057
Come.

716
01:02:07,605 --> 01:02:08,755
Where are they?

717
01:02:13,459 --> 01:02:14,821
Where?

718
01:02:33,498 --> 01:02:34,955
Don't worry, Girja.

719
01:02:36,439 --> 01:02:40,164
Now they've taken second births.

720
01:02:41,997 --> 01:02:46,263
One day past will bring them here.

721
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,699
And Suraj had even come
to the tomb once.

722
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:54,223
You say that Devi
too was with him.

723
01:02:57,554 --> 01:03:01,765
Now you've taken second birth,
Devi.

724
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:07,727
Come to me with Suraj once.

725
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:13,329
So that I can repent for my sins.

726
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,261
It feels so strange, right?

727
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:21,729
Just a few days ago we didn't
even know each other.

728
01:03:22,156 --> 01:03:23,258
Why not?

729
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:27,998
I know you since I
started dreaming.

730
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,292
And if you hadn't known me..

731
01:03:30,964 --> 01:03:32,363
..how could you make my portrait?

732
01:03:32,764 --> 01:03:35,232
How did we know each other
without meeting?

733
01:03:35,796 --> 01:03:37,788
This is called love, Reshma.

734
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:40,984
When the river flows from
hills it doesn't..

735
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:42,861
..know it has to meet the ocean.

736
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,600
It doesn't know the ocean but yet
it runs towards the ocean.

737
01:03:47,173 --> 01:03:49,258
We too were running
towards each other.

738
01:03:50,098 --> 01:03:53,033
Now it seems we were born to meet.

739
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:55,300
Now will we separate?

740
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,196
We didn't meet to be separated.

741
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,662
But yet I've this strange fear.

742
01:03:59,765 --> 01:04:00,785
What fear?

743
01:04:00,865 --> 01:04:02,833
The fear of meeting stealthily.

744
01:04:03,797 --> 01:04:06,028
One day my caravan will shift.

745
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:09,162
And your palace will be left here.

746
01:04:09,265 --> 01:04:12,792
I loved you, not my palace.

747
01:04:12,898 --> 01:04:14,456
But when my tribes..

748
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:17,762
..and your family will know,
what will happen?

749
01:04:17,998 --> 01:04:19,465
They've to know.

750
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,999
Without it we can't unite.

751
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:24,166
Try to understand, Kunwar.

752
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,093
People of palace are proud.

753
01:04:26,566 --> 01:04:29,196
Even our tribesmen
are no less proud.

754
01:04:30,857 --> 01:04:32,825
Love is very proud too.

755
01:04:33,747 --> 01:04:35,222
We'll see what happens.

756
01:04:48,938 --> 01:04:50,048
It's fine.

757
01:04:50,742 --> 01:04:52,077
But where is the diamond set?

758
01:04:52,157 --> 01:04:54,057
Sir, it will be here by
day after tomorrow.

759
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,484
Actually this work is..

760
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,089
Don't delay this work.
Good that you came, Neha!

761
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:02,984
You've chosen the boy.
Now choose jewelries too.

762
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:12,757
What happened, daughter?

763
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:16,460
Dad, why are you spending
money on jewelries?

764
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:19,257
This wedding won't take place.

765
01:05:19,823 --> 01:05:20,882
What are you saying?

766
01:05:21,124 --> 01:05:22,148
The truth.

767
01:05:22,957 --> 01:05:25,323
Kunwar is in love with
that gypsy girl.

768
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:27,721
It can't happen.

769
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:29,422
You keep your wishful thinking.

770
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:33,387
No.. Kunwar can't dare to do this.

771
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:38,889
He knows proud Rajput won't
tolerate this humiliation.

772
01:05:39,823 --> 01:05:42,850
Entire city knows that Kunwar's
marriage is fixed with you.

773
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,289
So he'll marry only you.

774
01:05:46,456 --> 01:05:47,755
Don't worry, child.

775
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:51,860
I won't let Rana go
back on his words.

776
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,224
Come, Ranjit Singh!
You're right on time.

777
01:06:03,757 --> 01:06:05,925
This is Kasprov and Karpo's game.

778
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:08,954
I don't understand,
how did Karpo..

779
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,221
..moved the paw in this game.

780
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:14,648
To win a game..

781
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:19,625
..people even sacrifice the queen,
Rana Udaibhan Shishodia.

782
01:06:21,283 --> 01:06:23,091
I thought our friendship..

783
01:06:24,157 --> 01:06:26,596
..has buried our family feud.

784
01:06:27,757 --> 01:06:29,850
But now I know that
Shishodia Rajput..

785
01:06:30,857 --> 01:06:33,376
..can't forget friendship
not enmity.

786
01:06:34,376 --> 01:06:37,004
You live only for vengeance.

787
01:06:38,176 --> 01:06:39,473
What rubbish!

788
01:06:39,648 --> 01:06:42,974
I'm right, Rana.
You kept me in the dark..

789
01:06:43,376 --> 01:06:45,241
..that Kunwar will marry Neha.

790
01:06:46,009 --> 01:06:48,170
But this wasn't the voice
of your heart.

791
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:52,724
To humiliate us, you played
this lowly game. -Ranjit!

792
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:54,274
Don't shout, Rana!

793
01:06:54,876 --> 01:06:58,778
When you saw that entire
Rajput community knows..

794
01:06:59,127 --> 01:07:01,470
..that my daughter will
marry your son..

795
01:07:01,734 --> 01:07:03,763
..you give freedom
to your son to..

796
01:07:03,843 --> 01:07:05,834
..be in love with that gypsy girl.

797
01:07:06,143 --> 01:07:08,771
What nonsense are you uttering!

798
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:11,470
Every kid of the city knows this,
Rana.

799
01:07:14,942 --> 01:07:16,433
I couldn't even think..

800
01:07:17,009 --> 01:07:18,840
..that son of Shishodia clan..

801
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:22,875
..will humiliate the family
in such a way.

802
01:07:23,942 --> 01:07:25,069
Even after knowing..

803
01:07:25,176 --> 01:07:29,271
..I've decided to get you married
in a decent Rajput family..

804
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:34,214
..you dared to love a gypsy girl.

805
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:39,311
Dad, I never said I want
to or I'll marry Neha.

806
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:41,604
Who are you to say this?

807
01:07:42,776 --> 01:07:45,301
It's my work to say
whom you'll marry.

808
01:07:45,743 --> 01:07:47,233
And you've to obey.

809
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:51,482
Love is a game for which
I can forgive you.

810
01:07:52,076 --> 01:07:55,028
But how could you think
that I'll let my son..

811
01:07:55,108 --> 01:07:57,655
..marry a gypsy girl?

812
01:07:58,553 --> 01:08:00,104
You've the right to
be angry on me dad!

813
01:08:01,365 --> 01:08:03,710
But we Rajput have traditions..

814
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,671
..that honor is dear to us.

815
01:08:06,928 --> 01:08:10,778
With honor we lose our head too!

816
01:08:13,076 --> 01:08:17,809
Don't forget this mansion will
be yours only after my death.

817
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:22,105
As long as I'm alive, what I want
will happen in this mansion.

818
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:27,610
And you explain to your
son very well..

819
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:30,774
..that it's not important
for us to listen to him..

820
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:34,841
..but it's his duty to obey us.

821
01:08:44,383 --> 01:08:50,043
Mother, do you agree with dad too
like these lifeless mansion?

822
01:08:50,843 --> 01:08:53,243
Don't you value a living
human being?

823
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:55,241
It's not so, Kumar.

824
01:08:56,223 --> 01:08:59,090
But we're brought up in
a different tradition.

825
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:02,021
Learn to endure your father.

826
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:06,048
Don't bring me to a juncture son..

827
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:10,223
..where I've to chose
between your dad..

828
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,715
..and you.

829
01:09:14,456 --> 01:09:18,722
I.. can't live without any of you.

830
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:30,208
Sir, you summoned me?

831
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:31,914
Yes.

832
01:09:32,823 --> 01:09:34,532
I called you because..

833
01:09:35,393 --> 01:09:36,722
..I want to order you..

834
01:09:37,335 --> 01:09:40,287
..that before sunrise
leave the place.

835
01:09:41,856 --> 01:09:44,416
What crime this loyal servant do,
sir?

836
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:48,350
You forgot the loyalty of ages!

837
01:09:50,032 --> 01:09:53,275
Or you think we too ended
with monarchy.

838
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:58,349
Has the passage of time
dwindled the loyalty..

839
01:09:58,515 --> 01:10:01,415
..that use to be on
your lips once?

840
01:10:01,723 --> 01:10:02,781
What are you saying?

841
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:06,429
We don't even know the
meaning of disloyalty!

842
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,758
We've not spread carpet under
your ancestors' feet..

843
01:10:09,856 --> 01:10:11,221
..but our corpses..

844
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:14,224
..to save them from dishonor.

845
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:17,215
So how could you dream of
coming out of slums..

846
01:10:18,023 --> 01:10:20,218
..to settle in palace!

847
01:10:21,223 --> 01:10:23,817
If unknowingly we made
some mistake..

848
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,180
..so I promise to punish
the culprit.

849
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,254
Stop this charade of loyalty!

850
01:10:29,889 --> 01:10:33,121
You're using your daughter
to trap Kunwar.

851
01:10:33,723 --> 01:10:35,714
So that from the tent of loyalty..

852
01:10:36,184 --> 01:10:37,387
..you can seize this palace..

853
01:10:37,889 --> 01:10:40,916
..where past of our honor
and pride resides.

854
01:10:41,356 --> 01:10:44,987
Someone must've tried
to defame me, sir.

855
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:47,869
My Reshma doesn't
even know Kunwar.

856
01:10:48,401 --> 01:10:50,656
I knew you would say this.

857
01:10:51,588 --> 01:10:55,860
If Reshma doesn't know Kunwar,
what is this?

858
01:11:04,497 --> 01:11:07,817
This portrait is of Reshma, sir!

859
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:11,181
Kunwar made this portrait.

860
01:11:13,575 --> 01:11:15,756
If your daughter doesn't
know Kunwar..

861
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:18,036
..so how did he make
this portrait?

862
01:11:28,019 --> 01:11:29,237
It's some other girl, sir.

863
01:11:30,538 --> 01:11:31,818
Look at her attire.

864
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:33,948
It's of royal family.

865
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:36,369
Attire doesn't change the face.

866
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:41,351
Now before my anger forget
your sacrifices..

867
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:43,785
..go and explain to
your daughter..

868
01:11:44,237 --> 01:11:47,753
..not to step on the path
leading to the palace.

869
01:11:48,613 --> 01:11:51,348
Her entire life will passing
tying to reach the destination.

870
01:12:03,756 --> 01:12:06,816
You've humiliated our tribe!

871
01:12:07,175 --> 01:12:09,405
For the first time in ages..

872
01:12:10,008 --> 01:12:14,207
..I've been humiliated.

873
01:12:16,242 --> 01:12:17,937
Whatever I heard today..

874
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,243
..if someone else had said
it besides Rana..

875
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:25,743
..I swear,
I would've cut him into pieces.

876
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:26,968
What did Mr. Rana say?

877
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:31,671
He blamed me of dreaming
of getting palace.

878
01:12:31,775 --> 01:12:33,834
He said I'm using you..

879
01:12:33,942 --> 01:12:36,376
..my daughter to trap Kunwar.

880
01:12:36,742 --> 01:12:38,039
Since when do you know Kunwar?

881
01:12:39,175 --> 01:12:42,216
I saw him for the first time
in the function that day.

882
01:12:42,518 --> 01:12:43,709
Don't lie!

883
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,295
If you didn't know how could you..

884
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,266
..forget your sorrow seeing him?

885
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:51,374
How could Kunwar make your
portrait without seeing him?

886
01:12:52,425 --> 01:12:56,176
You know father, I don't lie.

887
01:12:57,344 --> 01:13:00,005
It's true that Kunwar made my
portrait without seeing me..

888
01:13:00,842 --> 01:13:03,329
..and that day when I saw
him in the function..

889
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:05,104
..I came out of depression..

890
01:13:06,286 --> 01:13:11,943
..because I've been seeing Kunwar
in my dreams for years.

891
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:14,202
What are you saying?

892
01:13:15,275 --> 01:13:16,936
Yes, father. It's true.

893
01:13:17,675 --> 01:13:20,616
I don't know the secret
behind this.

894
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,299
No.. I don't believe this.

895
01:13:24,903 --> 01:13:27,176
This is rubbish!
We'll leave today!

896
01:13:27,275 --> 01:13:30,267
No, father.
Don't do this or I'll die.

897
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:35,122
It means.. what Rana said is true.

898
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,860
You can think so,
but I can't live without Kunwar.

899
01:13:39,996 --> 01:13:43,540
How dare you talk to me like this!

900
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,274
Get one thing clearly..

901
01:13:46,907 --> 01:13:52,035
..if you even take Kunwar's name,
I'll cut your lips.

902
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,807
Do you want to say anything?

903
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,967
Dad,
you've always fulfilled my wish.

904
01:14:17,804 --> 01:14:20,135
I got more that I asked for.

905
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:23,102
Fulfil my last wish.

906
01:14:23,374 --> 01:14:25,274
Henceforth I won't
ask for anything.

907
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:26,964
I want..

908
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:31,837
For your stubbornness,
I can't forget..

909
01:14:32,072 --> 01:14:35,237
..our 900 years old and
proud family history.

910
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:39,167
You're talking of the past, daddy.

911
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,834
Don't I've the right to make
decision of my life.

912
01:14:42,332 --> 01:14:44,870
I take all the decisions
in this mansion.

913
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:48,241
As long as I'm alive, I'll do so.

914
01:14:49,593 --> 01:14:51,072
I've decided..

915
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,876
..you'll marry Ranjit Singh's
daughter Neha.

916
01:14:55,653 --> 01:14:56,634
Go..

917
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:59,675
..and learn to live
with my decision.

918
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:05,733
I didn't want such a time
to come in life..

919
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:08,668
..where I've to disobey you.

920
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,738
But you brought me
to that juncture.

921
01:15:12,445 --> 01:15:13,874
Now listen to my decision too.

922
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,971
I can't marry Neha or any
girl of your choice.

923
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:20,041
Insolent!

924
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,827
What are you doing?

925
01:15:21,907 --> 01:15:23,738
Does anyone raises hands
on a young son!

926
01:15:23,929 --> 01:15:28,174
On the son who wants to disgrace
the honor of the palace..

927
01:15:28,427 --> 01:15:29,764
..I can even..

928
01:15:29,844 --> 01:15:31,341
For a child's happiness..

929
01:15:31,973 --> 01:15:34,704
..parents sacrifice everything,
but you..

930
01:15:34,807 --> 01:15:37,799
People of Shishodia clan can
sacrifice life to a child..

931
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,735
..but they can't dishonor
the family for the child.

932
01:15:42,024 --> 01:15:43,965
If he has decided to
marry a prostitute..

933
01:15:44,451 --> 01:15:47,835
..and live an anonymous life..

934
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,233
..this palace has
no place for him.

935
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:55,973
An anonymous life is better..

936
01:15:56,729 --> 01:15:58,365
..than the place where
elders call..

937
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:01,167
..daughter-in-law a prostitute.
Bye. -Son, stop.

938
01:16:01,247 --> 01:16:05,336
Let him go.
I'll think we had no child.

939
01:16:07,918 --> 01:16:09,638
Kumar, where are you going?

940
01:16:11,518 --> 01:16:13,281
Away from these merciless walls!

941
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:16,215
I'm leaving this house for ever
breaking the traditions.

942
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,143
Don't talk like mad!

943
01:16:18,736 --> 01:16:21,411
Does anyone leave parents
and house like this?

944
01:16:21,985 --> 01:16:24,385
You'll forget your roots
for that gypsy girl.

945
01:16:25,485 --> 01:16:29,717
The root which ask for sacrifice
of my heart can't be mine.

946
01:16:30,068 --> 01:16:31,280
You're very angry right now.

947
01:16:31,492 --> 01:16:32,978
You don't know what you're saying.

948
01:16:33,204 --> 01:16:34,104
Come to my house.

949
01:16:34,184 --> 01:16:35,209
Neha..

950
01:16:35,385 --> 01:16:37,751
..maybe you're mistaken about me.

951
01:16:38,184 --> 01:16:40,278
I never promised to marry you..

952
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:42,478
..nor I saw you as my wife.

953
01:16:43,051 --> 01:16:46,316
If you thought so,
I can't be blamed.

954
01:16:46,951 --> 01:16:48,248
Get one thing clear..

955
01:16:48,351 --> 01:16:51,643
..we can't never get married.
Get it. Never!

956
01:17:22,152 --> 01:17:23,151
Where could they go?

957
01:17:51,657 --> 01:17:59,639
Our love saga is here..

958
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:04,787
..but you're not there..

959
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:17,821
Our love saga is here,
but not you.

960
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:25,891
I have your souvenirs..

961
01:18:26,215 --> 01:18:31,084
..but not you.

962
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:36,448
Our love saga is here..

963
01:18:36,548 --> 01:18:44,062
..but you're not there..

964
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:57,901
The love and youth is the same,
but not you.

965
01:18:57,981 --> 01:19:11,088
Our love saga is here,
but not you.

966
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,439
The cold breeze..

967
01:19:38,381 --> 01:19:42,843
..the shadow of sorrow..

968
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:49,012
The cold breeze,
the shadow of sorrow..

969
01:19:49,114 --> 01:19:54,280
..and the defamation of love..

970
01:19:54,484 --> 01:19:59,409
On one life..

971
01:19:59,605 --> 01:20:07,320
..there are so many problems,
but not you.

972
01:20:07,748 --> 01:20:21,355
Our love saga is here,
but not you.

973
01:20:47,633 --> 01:20:52,378
God is merciful.

974
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:57,409
If I pray to him..

975
01:20:58,147 --> 01:21:03,282
God is merciful.

976
01:21:03,381 --> 01:21:08,785
If I pray to him..

977
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:18,813
..what else can I ask from him?

978
01:21:19,467 --> 01:21:31,896
He has bestowed everything,
but not you.

979
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:45,318
Our love saga is here,
but not you.

980
01:22:33,826 --> 01:22:37,980
The feet are shackled.

981
01:22:39,148 --> 01:22:42,815
There is sorrow of separation.

982
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:49,704
The feet are shackled.
- There is sorrow of separation.

983
01:22:49,784 --> 01:22:55,063
There is ocean of grief.

984
01:22:55,143 --> 01:23:07,419
Tear come in the eyes day
and night, but not you.

985
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:20,155
Our love saga is here,
but not you.

986
01:23:21,432 --> 01:23:28,888
I have your souvenirs..

987
01:23:29,078 --> 01:23:34,044
..but not you.

988
01:23:34,591 --> 01:23:46,720
Our love saga is here,
but not you.

989
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:29,415
Listen.

990
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,495
Look..
- Where are you going?

991
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:40,009
You know me?

992
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:42,062
Your tribes.. where is Reshma?

993
01:24:42,142 --> 01:24:43,067
Kunwar..

994
01:24:43,147 --> 01:24:44,971
..if gypsies see you..

995
01:24:45,051 --> 01:24:46,369
Please go away.

996
01:24:46,905 --> 01:24:48,100
I should leave!

997
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:49,469
But why?

998
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:52,302
Because gypsies have
code of honor..

999
01:24:52,742 --> 01:24:55,210
It has limits too.

1000
01:24:55,868 --> 01:24:57,100
Reshma's crime is..

1001
01:24:57,563 --> 01:25:01,009
..she crossed her limits to
fall in love with you.

1002
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:02,737
And your crime is..

1003
01:25:03,233 --> 01:25:05,104
..you crossed that code of honor.

1004
01:25:06,139 --> 01:25:08,267
I don't accept this code.

1005
01:25:08,347 --> 01:25:09,635
Maybe you don't know..

1006
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:11,666
..Reshma has staked her life.

1007
01:25:12,203 --> 01:25:14,742
She's refusing to marry
Shakti Singh.

1008
01:25:15,067 --> 01:25:16,709
She has given up food and water.

1009
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:19,367
If she hadn't been the only
daughter of the chief..

1010
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,669
..council would've given
her death penalty.

1011
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:25,402
It means she needs me.

1012
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:27,896
Look..

1013
01:25:27,976 --> 01:25:29,204
..please take me to her.

1014
01:25:29,284 --> 01:25:32,369
I'll take her away from
both the families.

1015
01:25:32,713 --> 01:25:33,666
No, Kunwar.

1016
01:25:33,867 --> 01:25:35,534
You can't meet her.

1017
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:37,132
To meet her..

1018
01:25:37,351 --> 01:25:39,142
..you've to wait for
the next birth.

1019
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:40,504
No..

1020
01:25:41,676 --> 01:25:43,371
I can't wait.

1021
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:45,237
I can die..

1022
01:25:45,342 --> 01:25:46,536
..but I can't wait.

1023
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,033
It seems..

1024
01:25:49,309 --> 01:25:51,209
..you both have waited a long.

1025
01:25:51,715 --> 01:25:54,674
Look, Kunwar.
I can't take you to her..

1026
01:25:54,976 --> 01:25:57,911
..but I'll try to
bring her to you.

1027
01:25:58,109 --> 01:26:01,340
She won't let anyone come
closer in anger.

1028
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:03,443
I'll see you later. Bye.

1029
01:26:09,509 --> 01:26:10,533
Reshma.

1030
01:26:12,144 --> 01:26:13,233
Come in.

1031
01:26:15,442 --> 01:26:16,500
Keep it here.

1032
01:26:17,228 --> 01:26:19,073
Hurry up. Everyone, keep it down.

1033
01:26:20,142 --> 01:26:22,076
Now go out.

1034
01:26:27,704 --> 01:26:29,901
Reshma, eat food.

1035
01:26:31,176 --> 01:26:34,612
Look,
you need to eat even to be angry.

1036
01:26:35,042 --> 01:26:37,033
Look what I got for you.

1037
01:26:37,142 --> 01:26:38,439
That's chicken.

1038
01:26:38,754 --> 01:26:43,411
I caught it and made it.
Now I'll feed you.

1039
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,368
I knew..

1040
01:26:52,476 --> 01:26:55,710
..nobody can resist the aroma
of delicious food.

1041
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:57,468
When my mother died..

1042
01:26:57,575 --> 01:27:01,444
..my father cooked this food
and kept near her corpse.

1043
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:04,486
My mother got up,
ate food and died again.

1044
01:27:05,301 --> 01:27:06,366
Shake hands..

1045
01:27:06,648 --> 01:27:07,806
If you don't go out..

1046
01:27:08,176 --> 01:27:09,302
..I'll eat you.

1047
01:27:09,909 --> 01:27:11,934
Take your chicken and get out.

1048
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:13,805
Reshma, I made it with love.

1049
01:27:13,984 --> 01:27:16,096
Get out.
-This chicken is very good.

1050
01:27:16,176 --> 01:27:18,041
Get out! -Reshma!

1051
01:27:18,326 --> 01:27:19,336
Get out of here!

1052
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:20,941
What did you do?

1053
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,771
Get out! -Listen, Reshma.

1054
01:27:25,021 --> 01:27:26,000
Go away!

1055
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,338
Hey, I'm your to be..

1056
01:27:27,522 --> 01:27:28,466
Go!

1057
01:27:30,481 --> 01:27:31,573
I'm very dangerous.

1058
01:27:31,653 --> 01:27:32,908
Get lost!

1059
01:27:33,209 --> 01:27:34,982
Oh.. what a..

1060
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:38,000
What happened to you?

1061
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:40,237
Son, you went to fed Reshma.

1062
01:27:40,317 --> 01:27:43,311
Yes, but she did this to me.

1063
01:27:43,942 --> 01:27:47,469
Chief, your daughter has lost it!
She has gone mad.

1064
01:27:47,707 --> 01:27:50,457
No, son. It's not so.
-She's just hot tempered.

1065
01:27:50,537 --> 01:27:54,072
She's not the only one!
Arrange for my bath. -Son..

1066
01:27:56,455 --> 01:27:57,479
Chief.

1067
01:27:58,155 --> 01:27:59,349
This isn't just anger.

1068
01:28:00,062 --> 01:28:02,349
Anger of such a cute girl..

1069
01:28:02,938 --> 01:28:04,455
..can't be so dangerous.

1070
01:28:05,141 --> 01:28:08,418
I think she's possessed
by some spirit.

1071
01:28:09,555 --> 01:28:13,321
Look, your daughter will
be my daughter-in-law.

1072
01:28:13,816 --> 01:28:16,583
If I had been you, I would've
called witch-doctor Bhujangi.

1073
01:28:16,928 --> 01:28:18,489
Bhujangi? Who is he?

1074
01:28:18,851 --> 01:28:20,184
A skilled witch doctor.

1075
01:28:20,766 --> 01:28:22,255
I met him once long ago.

1076
01:28:22,653 --> 01:28:23,919
I've heard his praises.

1077
01:28:24,322 --> 01:28:25,482
With one puff..

1078
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:29,185
..he can perform exorcism
to control the spirit.

1079
01:28:29,622 --> 01:28:30,850
So call him.

1080
01:28:31,322 --> 01:28:33,415
Fine. I'll call him today. -Okay.

1081
01:28:38,611 --> 01:28:40,887
Sir, a flower in desert!

1082
01:28:40,988 --> 01:28:42,421
She's Ambika.

1083
01:28:42,843 --> 01:28:43,912
Where is Reshma?

1084
01:28:44,188 --> 01:28:46,816
She can't come. She's not well.

1085
01:28:47,226 --> 01:28:48,108
What happened?

1086
01:28:48,188 --> 01:28:51,282
I don't believe it,
but they say she's possessed.

1087
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:52,946
What rubbish!

1088
01:28:53,026 --> 01:28:56,120
Chief has called Bhujangi
tomorrow for exorcism.

1089
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,908
Bhujangi! -Yes.

1090
01:28:57,988 --> 01:29:00,855
Who is he?
-An accomplished witch doctor.

1091
01:29:01,021 --> 01:29:02,375
He performs exorcism with music.

1092
01:29:02,455 --> 01:29:05,108
He rides black horse. -What?

1093
01:29:05,188 --> 01:29:06,314
Black horse?

1094
01:29:09,455 --> 01:29:10,513
Bhujangi!

1095
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,012
Sir..

1096
01:29:18,122 --> 01:29:19,919
He's Bhujangi

1097
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,283
Disciple Surangi.

1098
01:29:22,463 --> 01:29:24,788
Yes, sir Bhujangi.

1099
01:29:25,605 --> 01:29:27,353
Give me an orange.

1100
01:29:27,788 --> 01:29:28,812
Orange?

1101
01:29:29,188 --> 01:29:31,520
My throat is parched.

1102
01:29:32,222 --> 01:29:34,486
I'm exhausted.

1103
01:29:35,321 --> 01:29:36,880
Do you've any fruit?

1104
01:29:37,069 --> 01:29:39,248
Sir, I've no fruit.

1105
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:42,090
But this drink.

1106
01:29:46,655 --> 01:29:49,146
We've reached here
thanks to Ambika.

1107
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:51,651
But how do deal with Bhujangi?

1108
01:29:52,106 --> 01:29:53,850
He himself looks like a ghost.

1109
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,654
What? Ghost!

1110
01:29:55,889 --> 01:29:56,946
Yes.

1111
01:29:57,121 --> 01:29:58,248
Yes, ghost.

1112
01:29:58,655 --> 01:30:01,175
Ghost will catch a ghost. -How?

1113
01:30:01,255 --> 01:30:03,189
You didn't get it. Come closer.

1114
01:30:06,621 --> 01:30:09,284
Hail Bhujangi!

1115
01:30:09,388 --> 01:30:13,347
Sir, I'll never leave you.

1116
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:14,479
Fool!

1117
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:16,385
The one you want to touch..

1118
01:30:16,588 --> 01:30:17,646
..is on this horse.

1119
01:30:20,088 --> 01:30:21,919
Don't worry, child.

1120
01:30:22,155 --> 01:30:25,454
This is the first step to heaven.

1121
01:30:25,701 --> 01:30:27,284
I plead to you, sage!

1122
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:28,582
Forgive me.

1123
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:29,947
Bless you.

1124
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:31,075
Be happy!

1125
01:30:31,155 --> 01:30:33,171
But I'm in trouble now.

1126
01:30:33,355 --> 01:30:37,008
My brother is possessed by
a spirit. -Spirit. -Yes.

1127
01:30:37,088 --> 01:30:39,488
I'll incinerate the spirit.

1128
01:30:40,288 --> 01:30:44,918
When music is played,
the ghost runs away!

1129
01:30:45,255 --> 01:30:47,416
But take care of your brother now.

1130
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:50,308
I've to go to the camps
of gypsies. -No..

1131
01:30:50,388 --> 01:30:53,516
A spirit is looming
over a gypsy girl..

1132
01:30:53,888 --> 01:30:55,947
..like a shadow.

1133
01:30:56,055 --> 01:30:57,249
I'll exorcist her.

1134
01:30:57,355 --> 01:31:00,381
Then I'll treat your brother.

1135
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:03,457
But sage, till then my brother..

1136
01:31:04,686 --> 01:31:06,555
My brother would've died.

1137
01:31:07,315 --> 01:31:11,522
Other merciful! If you leave
without treating my brother..

1138
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:14,455
..I'll die here.

1139
01:31:14,555 --> 01:31:15,575
Disciple Surangi.

1140
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:17,179
Yes, sir Bhujangi.

1141
01:31:17,288 --> 01:31:18,915
This child is stubborn.

1142
01:31:19,153 --> 01:31:22,520
Every child has the right to
be stubborn. -Son.. -Yes.

1143
01:31:22,789 --> 01:31:25,662
Take me to your brother.
-Come. -Let's go.

1144
01:31:25,742 --> 01:31:27,046
Come.

1145
01:31:30,665 --> 01:31:32,929
Come, sage.

1146
01:31:33,491 --> 01:31:34,457
Come inside.

1147
01:31:34,565 --> 01:31:36,552
Start now..
-The ghost will speak now.

1148
01:31:36,632 --> 01:31:38,657
I won't go.

1149
01:31:38,837 --> 01:31:40,092
I like this body.

1150
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:41,324
I like this body.

1151
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:45,061
I'll kill anyone who tells
me to leave this body.

1152
01:31:49,132 --> 01:31:51,083
Why did you come here?

1153
01:31:51,163 --> 01:31:53,358
I like this body!
Why did you come?

1154
01:31:53,465 --> 01:31:55,990
You brought him here.. -Calm down.

1155
01:31:56,098 --> 01:31:58,430
I'll go.. I'm going.. I've left.

1156
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,556
Brother.

1157
01:31:59,665 --> 01:32:00,962
Calm down.

1158
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:02,418
This ghost was very coward.

1159
01:32:02,498 --> 01:32:04,090
I had to take no trouble.

1160
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:05,222
Water.

1161
01:32:09,532 --> 01:32:11,693
Brother.. you're conscious.

1162
01:32:11,863 --> 01:32:14,330
Brother, I you hadn't woken
up, I would've fainted.

1163
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:17,552
Where am I, Sarju?

1164
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,532
Brother,
you're at Bhujangi's feet.

1165
01:32:19,632 --> 01:32:22,567
Seeing him the ghost fled.

1166
01:32:23,898 --> 01:32:26,628
Brother, now with his blessings..

1167
01:32:27,231 --> 01:32:28,927
..you'll have no hurdle.

1168
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:30,465
Really? Sage..

1169
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:33,357
I'm grateful to you. -Bless you!

1170
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:37,318
I've no words to say how grateful
I'm. -Never mind. -Sage.

1171
01:32:37,398 --> 01:32:40,299
I'll do anything for you.
-Ask for anything.

1172
01:32:40,379 --> 01:32:42,424
Child, what can you do for me?

1173
01:32:42,532 --> 01:32:43,794
Look, sage..

1174
01:32:44,326 --> 01:32:46,561
..I've special cocaine.

1175
01:32:46,716 --> 01:32:48,532
Sarju, bring it.

1176
01:32:49,165 --> 01:32:53,226
Sage, if you take one puff of it..

1177
01:32:53,555 --> 01:32:57,059
..you'll be flying in
the sky for free.

1178
01:32:57,503 --> 01:33:00,018
I'll try it. -Yes.

1179
01:33:00,098 --> 01:33:01,122
Sarju.

1180
01:33:02,897 --> 01:33:05,526
Hail.. -Sit down.

1181
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:07,189
Take this.

1182
01:33:07,532 --> 01:33:09,227
Take a puff.

1183
01:33:15,365 --> 01:33:18,198
Give one puff to the baldy!
-Hail Lord!

1184
01:33:23,201 --> 01:33:28,001
Sage Bhujangi! The world is
colorful. -He fainted too.

1185
01:33:28,098 --> 01:33:30,157
They're floored! -3 days.

1186
01:33:30,318 --> 01:33:31,756
They won't wake up before 3 days.

1187
01:33:31,865 --> 01:33:33,423
It's true. But Sarju..

1188
01:33:33,798 --> 01:33:35,573
..what about the beard
and moustache?

1189
01:33:36,032 --> 01:33:37,090
I'll arrange for it.

1190
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:38,928
Sure? -Yes. Come.

1191
01:33:51,386 --> 01:33:53,729
Once Reshma recovers..

1192
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:55,849
..fix the wedding date.

1193
01:33:56,286 --> 01:33:57,344
Now don't delay.

1194
01:33:57,453 --> 01:33:58,886
Of course.

1195
01:33:59,353 --> 01:34:01,844
Hail sage!

1196
01:34:02,056 --> 01:34:04,514
Chief, sage Bhujangi is here.

1197
01:34:04,698 --> 01:34:06,349
Now everything will be fine. Come.

1198
01:34:07,186 --> 01:34:10,644
Hail sage!

1199
01:34:11,186 --> 01:34:14,155
Sage, thanks for coming.

1200
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:19,884
But Bhujangi,
you seem to be shorter. Why?

1201
01:34:20,386 --> 01:34:24,652
Fool! I've returned from Kailash
mountain after 3 years.

1202
01:34:25,353 --> 01:34:28,652
I met Lord Shankar
after meditation.

1203
01:34:28,753 --> 01:34:32,382
He told me, Bhujangi, whatever
you like the most..

1204
01:34:32,687 --> 01:34:34,120
..give it to me.

1205
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,578
My form..

1206
01:34:35,686 --> 01:34:38,154
You call it height. -I liked it.

1207
01:34:38,486 --> 01:34:41,250
I give him my half height.

1208
01:34:41,353 --> 01:34:45,187
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1209
01:34:45,286 --> 01:34:49,474
Shut up! Who is he?
I think he's an impostor!

1210
01:34:49,868 --> 01:34:52,120
He's not the one you
were talking about.

1211
01:34:52,332 --> 01:34:55,155
Bloody fool!
Blind! You doubt sage.

1212
01:34:55,502 --> 01:34:57,561
If sage gets furious..

1213
01:34:57,668 --> 01:35:00,296
..he'll incinerate
you with his gaze.

1214
01:35:00,401 --> 01:35:01,945
Shut up. Don't talk rubbish.

1215
01:35:02,468 --> 01:35:05,869
Sage, he's my son.
He's a fool. Forgive him.

1216
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:08,967
But he doesn't seem
to be all right.

1217
01:35:09,401 --> 01:35:13,600
It seems his heart is
wooed by someone.

1218
01:35:14,468 --> 01:35:17,198
And that girl is in love..

1219
01:35:17,302 --> 01:35:19,236
..with someone else.

1220
01:35:20,201 --> 01:35:21,396
Right?

1221
01:35:22,235 --> 01:35:23,259
Correct!

1222
01:35:25,568 --> 01:35:28,560
Sage, you're great!

1223
01:35:28,884 --> 01:35:32,238
Don't worry.
From that girl's heart..

1224
01:35:32,335 --> 01:35:34,114
..I'll remove the old image..

1225
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:37,735
..and fix your image in it.

1226
01:35:37,835 --> 01:35:38,893
Thank you, sage.

1227
01:35:39,093 --> 01:35:40,321
Seek his blessing, fool.

1228
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:41,869
Where are his feet? -Here.

1229
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:43,765
You know what's in my heart.

1230
01:35:44,201 --> 01:35:49,455
Take me to the girl. But nobody
else will come with me. -Why?

1231
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:54,747
So that solitude won't be
disturbed. But you can come.

1232
01:35:55,691 --> 01:35:56,592
Thank you, sage.

1233
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:58,055
Take me to her.

1234
01:35:58,135 --> 01:36:00,083
Nobody will follow.

1235
01:36:00,163 --> 01:36:03,304
Hail sage Bhujangi! -Come, sage.

1236
01:36:03,384 --> 01:36:07,737
Hail sage Bhujangi! -Child..
-Sage.

1237
01:36:07,967 --> 01:36:09,326
Wait for me.

1238
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:11,671
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1239
01:36:12,276 --> 01:36:14,887
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1240
01:36:15,068 --> 01:36:18,055
Sage Bhujangi,
please get my work done.

1241
01:36:18,135 --> 01:36:20,330
Reshma, look who is here.

1242
01:36:22,192 --> 01:36:26,066
Child!
You're insulting sage Bhujangi.

1243
01:36:26,488 --> 01:36:29,064
Fool, I'll free you..

1244
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:31,731
..from the sorrow of separation.

1245
01:36:31,811 --> 01:36:36,593
I'll take you to your beloved
in the season of rain!

1246
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:38,043
You fool!

1247
01:36:38,518 --> 01:36:39,849
Sage Bhujangi!

1248
01:36:39,951 --> 01:36:40,975
Child.

1249
01:36:41,451 --> 01:36:42,471
Go out!

1250
01:36:42,551 --> 01:36:43,540
Sage Bhujangi!

1251
01:36:44,906 --> 01:36:45,838
Get lost!

1252
01:36:45,918 --> 01:36:46,976
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1253
01:36:48,518 --> 01:36:49,542
Go out.

1254
01:36:49,985 --> 01:36:52,453
Sage,
how much more will I get thrashed!

1255
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:54,571
Hail sage Bhujangi. -Child..

1256
01:36:54,651 --> 01:36:56,551
I can't see anything.

1257
01:36:56,851 --> 01:37:00,651
Don't worry, son.
You've passed the first test.

1258
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:02,241
Now you know..

1259
01:37:02,584 --> 01:37:04,417
Sage, it's blessing of your baton.
-True.

1260
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,848
Now keep going.

1261
01:37:07,339 --> 01:37:08,338
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1262
01:37:08,418 --> 01:37:10,215
Child.. no..

1263
01:37:12,485 --> 01:37:14,544
Calm down, child.

1264
01:37:15,285 --> 01:37:16,684
Bad time has passed.

1265
01:37:16,785 --> 01:37:17,809
You too get lost.

1266
01:37:18,451 --> 01:37:22,251
The earth and sky can leave,
but not this man!

1267
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:25,577
Why not! Get out of here.. -No..

1268
01:37:25,685 --> 01:37:26,709
My beard.

1269
01:37:45,351 --> 01:37:47,148
What? You're crying.

1270
01:37:47,982 --> 01:37:50,786
You don't know what
I went through.

1271
01:37:51,285 --> 01:37:53,185
I'm here.
Now everything will be fine.

1272
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:55,412
But.. why did you come here?

1273
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:56,917
They won't spare you alive.

1274
01:37:58,218 --> 01:38:00,152
I'll die even without you.

1275
01:38:01,384 --> 01:38:02,613
Don't say that.

1276
01:38:03,642 --> 01:38:05,213
If we're destined to die..

1277
01:38:05,961 --> 01:38:07,513
..then before you, I'll die.

1278
01:38:07,593 --> 01:38:08,911
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1279
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:10,745
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1280
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,218
How come my portrait is here!

1281
01:38:17,795 --> 01:38:20,176
I made it with my heart.

1282
01:38:22,952 --> 01:38:25,879
I heard you didn't
eat for many days.

1283
01:38:26,953 --> 01:38:28,616
I don't like anything without you.

1284
01:38:30,656 --> 01:38:31,782
Child Surangi.

1285
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:33,584
Yes, sage Bhujangi!

1286
01:38:33,689 --> 01:38:35,623
Bring food for the girl.

1287
01:38:35,956 --> 01:38:38,516
Child, did you see sage's magic!

1288
01:38:38,823 --> 01:38:40,313
The girl wants food.

1289
01:38:40,423 --> 01:38:42,180
Reshma has recovered.

1290
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:43,822
Sage has ordered not to come in.

1291
01:38:43,994 --> 01:38:45,390
You bring food.

1292
01:38:45,489 --> 01:38:48,356
Did you hear?
Reshma has recovered.

1293
01:38:48,531 --> 01:38:50,543
Bring food for Reshma.

1294
01:38:50,623 --> 01:38:52,921
I'll arrange for my drinks.

1295
01:38:58,656 --> 01:39:00,214
But how will we get out of here?

1296
01:39:00,294 --> 01:39:01,881
I'll find a way.

1297
01:39:02,823 --> 01:39:06,224
Trust sage Bhujangi!

1298
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:12,919
Tell me, will Mr. Rana accept you?

1299
01:39:17,289 --> 01:39:18,313
Reshma.

1300
01:39:19,423 --> 01:39:22,688
I've left my parents and house.

1301
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:24,313
What?

1302
01:39:24,656 --> 01:39:26,988
You left your house for me.

1303
01:39:28,456 --> 01:39:32,358
Not just the house, I can even
Leave the world for you.

1304
01:39:33,219 --> 01:39:35,416
Reshma has recovered!

1305
01:39:35,802 --> 01:39:37,651
My costume.. beard..

1306
01:39:38,724 --> 01:39:39,951
Lie down.

1307
01:39:40,222 --> 01:39:42,282
I.. where is my beard?

1308
01:39:44,389 --> 01:39:45,686
Reshma has recovered.

1309
01:39:47,289 --> 01:39:49,382
Reshma is sleeping.

1310
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:51,583
Hail sage!

1311
01:39:52,289 --> 01:39:57,921
Sage..
sage.. come out.. where is sage?

1312
01:39:58,473 --> 01:39:59,687
Did he vanish?

1313
01:40:00,289 --> 01:40:02,257
Very good.
There is no third wheel.

1314
01:40:03,178 --> 01:40:04,788
We don't need it.

1315
01:40:05,656 --> 01:40:09,114
Reshma is alone. I'm alone too.

1316
01:40:09,456 --> 01:40:13,688
We're in this tent!

1317
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:15,313
And some..

1318
01:40:16,714 --> 01:40:19,181
Hey.. who is it? Who hit me?

1319
01:40:19,289 --> 01:40:21,348
I won't spare you.
You attack from behind.

1320
01:40:22,151 --> 01:40:23,220
You hit me again.

1321
01:40:23,864 --> 01:40:25,122
What is it?

1322
01:40:26,289 --> 01:40:27,313
There is nobody.

1323
01:40:29,012 --> 01:40:31,188
Reshma is sleeping. Reshma!

1324
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:35,313
Reshma! I think I've lost my high.

1325
01:40:37,072 --> 01:40:38,117
It's empty.

1326
01:40:39,389 --> 01:40:42,415
Reshma.. Look who has come.

1327
01:40:42,856 --> 01:40:44,653
It's me.

1328
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,381
When you wake up..

1329
01:40:46,461 --> 01:40:49,550
..you'll see that we both
are alone in the tent.

1330
01:40:49,801 --> 01:40:51,860
It'll be fun.

1331
01:40:51,968 --> 01:40:54,766
Reshma, my dear.

1332
01:40:55,105 --> 01:40:57,692
How did it get filled?
I must've filled it.

1333
01:41:06,501 --> 01:41:07,525
Reshma.

1334
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:10,766
Come to my arms.

1335
01:41:10,867 --> 01:41:11,994
There is nobody..

1336
01:41:12,667 --> 01:41:18,265
What is it! Who is behind me?
Leave me or I'll kill you.

1337
01:41:18,367 --> 01:41:23,849
You attack from behind!
You hit me again!

1338
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:25,826
Who beat me?

1339
01:41:26,301 --> 01:41:28,326
Reshma. Reshma.

1340
01:41:28,434 --> 01:41:30,368
Hey. You hit me again.

1341
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:34,965
You hit me.

1342
01:41:37,128 --> 01:41:38,195
You?

1343
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:41,368
Hit me again!

1344
01:41:42,201 --> 01:41:45,500
Oh.. the photo hits me too.

1345
01:41:45,601 --> 01:41:46,795
I won't spare you.

1346
01:41:49,367 --> 01:41:50,494
Did it hurt?

1347
01:41:50,601 --> 01:41:52,161
Yes.

1348
01:41:52,434 --> 01:41:53,662
Reshma.

1349
01:41:54,168 --> 01:41:55,192
Reshma.

1350
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,526
Reshma.

1351
01:41:58,288 --> 01:41:59,258
You know Reshma.

1352
01:41:59,443 --> 01:42:01,598
Very well. Reshma.

1353
01:42:01,971 --> 01:42:03,734
So recommend me to her.

1354
01:42:04,334 --> 01:42:05,358
You? -Yes.

1355
01:42:05,534 --> 01:42:06,865
Okay.. take a step.

1356
01:42:07,601 --> 01:42:09,569
Ahead? -Here..

1357
01:42:09,843 --> 01:42:10,658
Look at me.

1358
01:42:14,231 --> 01:42:18,571
Ghost! I'm sure there is a ghost.

1359
01:42:35,903 --> 01:42:36,525
Surangi!

1360
01:42:36,691 --> 01:42:39,263
Yes, sage Bhujangi. -Where are we?

1361
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,460
Where we were before.

1362
01:42:40,924 --> 01:42:41,760
Where were we before?

1363
01:42:41,923 --> 01:42:42,949
Where we're now.

1364
01:42:43,782 --> 01:42:46,330
But we had to go to the
tents of gypsies.

1365
01:42:46,434 --> 01:42:47,458
Yes, sage.

1366
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:50,272
My baton.

1367
01:42:50,352 --> 01:42:51,369
My bowl.

1368
01:42:51,449 --> 01:42:52,602
Those two boys..

1369
01:42:59,338 --> 01:43:00,464
Our horse isn't here too.

1370
01:43:00,544 --> 01:43:01,568
You're right, sage.

1371
01:43:04,516 --> 01:43:06,739
Those two boys turned out
to be very naughty.

1372
01:43:07,877 --> 01:43:09,812
Hail sage Bhujangi!

1373
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:24,535
Sage.

1374
01:43:25,247 --> 01:43:26,470
Chief..

1375
01:43:27,519 --> 01:43:31,478
Sage, because of your mercy
my daughter is cured now.

1376
01:43:31,844 --> 01:43:33,471
I don't know..

1377
01:43:33,551 --> 01:43:34,636
..how to thank you.

1378
01:43:34,744 --> 01:43:36,268
You don't need to.

1379
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:40,011
I came here to solve your and
your daughter's problems.

1380
01:43:40,091 --> 01:43:41,191
Yes.

1381
01:43:41,271 --> 01:43:44,006
But I couldn't trust
she's cured so soon.

1382
01:43:44,183 --> 01:43:45,602
You did a miracle.

1383
01:43:46,436 --> 01:43:47,843
It's not a miracle..

1384
01:43:47,944 --> 01:43:50,936
..but way of Nature.

1385
01:43:51,044 --> 01:43:52,864
What? -Ways?

1386
01:43:52,944 --> 01:43:55,811
This is the essence of
knowledge of mankind.

1387
01:43:56,648 --> 01:43:57,364
Essence?

1388
01:43:57,444 --> 01:44:00,345
Oh.. -Inauguration! Vengeance!

1389
01:44:00,911 --> 01:44:01,969
You're great!

1390
01:44:02,666 --> 01:44:04,871
You did a big favor on us.

1391
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:07,997
To express gratitude, our tribe..

1392
01:44:08,077 --> 01:44:10,046
..has organized a
special function.

1393
01:44:10,819 --> 01:44:11,935
I hope..

1394
01:44:12,221 --> 01:44:13,503
..you'll surely come.

1395
01:44:13,811 --> 01:44:15,870
Will there be fire veneration
or prayer?

1396
01:44:16,077 --> 01:44:17,773
Sage, there will be dance.

1397
01:44:19,011 --> 01:44:21,275
It means, the girl will dance too.

1398
01:44:21,576 --> 01:44:22,668
Yes, sage.

1399
01:44:22,849 --> 01:44:25,071
I'll surely come. -Sage..

1400
01:45:23,999 --> 01:45:33,873
The traditions of tribes
won't change ever.

1401
01:45:34,478 --> 01:45:39,541
Foes and friends are forever.

1402
01:45:39,644 --> 01:45:49,610
The traditions of tribes
won't change ever.

1403
01:46:10,961 --> 01:46:15,510
High mountains and deep oceans..

1404
01:46:15,843 --> 01:46:20,907
..can't guard love.

1405
01:46:21,228 --> 01:46:31,281
High mountains and deep oceans
can't guard love.

1406
01:46:31,377 --> 01:46:36,315
Love breaks all hurdles.

1407
01:46:36,411 --> 01:46:46,377
The traditions of tribes
won't change ever.

1408
01:47:12,951 --> 01:47:17,806
God made our match.

1409
01:47:18,203 --> 01:47:23,248
This match can't be broken.

1410
01:47:23,344 --> 01:47:33,219
God made our match.
This match can't be broken.

1411
01:47:33,414 --> 01:47:38,427
..not just for one lifetime,
but for eternity.

1412
01:47:38,507 --> 01:47:49,242
The traditions of tribes
won't change ever.

1413
01:48:42,437 --> 01:48:46,797
Flowers and stars,
promises and vows..

1414
01:48:47,444 --> 01:48:51,898
..testify for me.

1415
01:48:52,989 --> 01:49:02,383
Flowers and stars,
promises and vows testify for me.

1416
01:49:02,983 --> 01:49:07,581
Even my anklets sing this song.

1417
01:49:08,149 --> 01:49:18,286
The traditions of tribes
won't change ever.

1418
01:49:18,511 --> 01:49:23,160
Foes and friends are forever.

1419
01:49:23,655 --> 01:49:34,243
The traditions of tribes
won't change ever.

1420
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:56,672
Who is this impostor?

1421
01:49:56,752 --> 01:49:59,493
Who has come here in my disguise?

1422
01:49:59,573 --> 01:50:01,846
I'll incinerate him. -Son Surangi.

1423
01:50:01,926 --> 01:50:05,180
Yes, sage. -Bring bowl of liquor.

1424
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,929
And you go out.

1425
01:50:07,009 --> 01:50:08,844
Because when I'll sprinkle
liquor on him..

1426
01:50:08,924 --> 01:50:12,496
..he'll be incinerated. -And if
the ashes goes in the eyes..

1427
01:50:12,597 --> 01:50:15,828
..even his 7 generations
will be born as blind.

1428
01:50:16,039 --> 01:50:16,982
Son Surangi.

1429
01:50:17,062 --> 01:50:18,081
Yes, sage Bhujangi.

1430
01:50:18,161 --> 01:50:19,588
What am I seeing?

1431
01:50:20,069 --> 01:50:22,864
Who is taking my place?

1432
01:50:23,345 --> 01:50:27,541
I'll rip him apart
with my mantras.

1433
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,593
Impostor!

1434
01:50:29,895 --> 01:50:34,567
Beggar! I'll.. abracadabra you!

1435
01:50:34,748 --> 01:50:37,010
You're enduring my insult
standing here.

1436
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:38,897
Get him out.

1437
01:50:40,537 --> 01:50:42,140
What are you doing, fool?

1438
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,192
You're pulling sage's beard.

1439
01:50:44,272 --> 01:50:46,091
His beard is real, chief.

1440
01:50:46,274 --> 01:50:47,648
He must've grown it.

1441
01:50:47,728 --> 01:50:49,956
But his soul is fake.

1442
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:53,294
He's the same naughty boy.

1443
01:50:53,374 --> 01:50:54,521
Yes, sage.

1444
01:51:07,397 --> 01:51:08,417
Leave him.

1445
01:51:08,497 --> 01:51:09,987
Move!

1446
01:51:10,332 --> 01:51:12,022
Reshma. Come here.

1447
01:52:01,967 --> 01:52:03,370
No!

1448
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:32,145
Leave me.

1449
01:52:34,035 --> 01:52:35,394
Move, I say.

1450
01:52:52,830 --> 01:52:53,854
Get back.

1451
01:53:01,203 --> 01:53:02,119
Bring my gun.

1452
01:53:02,199 --> 01:53:03,591
Let's get out of here.

1453
01:53:06,085 --> 01:53:07,922
Flee, kid.

1454
01:53:08,661 --> 01:53:10,393
He plays the drum nicely.

1455
01:53:10,736 --> 01:53:11,484
Follow them.

1456
01:53:11,564 --> 01:53:12,656
They shouldn't escape.

1457
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:17,063
Mr. Rana,
Kunwar's life is in danger.

1458
01:53:17,363 --> 01:53:18,888
I think all the tribesmen
will kill him.

1459
01:53:19,146 --> 01:53:21,465
Please come and save him.

1460
01:53:21,865 --> 01:53:23,798
Please come with me.

1461
01:54:07,692 --> 01:54:09,289
Get moving.

1462
01:54:17,882 --> 01:54:19,585
Where did they disappear?

1463
01:54:21,497 --> 01:54:22,654
What is this?

1464
01:54:22,734 --> 01:54:24,962
Open the door!

1465
01:54:29,697 --> 01:54:30,721
Come..

1466
01:54:33,797 --> 01:54:34,821
Girja.

1467
01:54:36,463 --> 01:54:37,556
Who has come?

1468
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:45,532
Hey. Devi..

1469
01:54:47,197 --> 01:54:48,528
Devi has come?

1470
01:54:48,985 --> 01:54:50,588
Suraj is with her too.

1471
01:54:50,874 --> 01:54:54,289
But kids, what happened to you?

1472
01:54:55,011 --> 01:54:58,331
Girja, don't just stand.
-Bring hot water.

1473
01:54:58,676 --> 01:55:00,797
Can't you see Suraj and
Devi are wounded?

1474
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,583
Sage, you're mistaken again.
-She's not Devi..

1475
01:55:03,663 --> 01:55:05,117
..but Reshma and I..

1476
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:06,556
I know.

1477
01:55:06,935 --> 01:55:10,595
But for me she's the
same small girl.

1478
01:55:11,143 --> 01:55:12,430
And you're Suraj.

1479
01:55:13,663 --> 01:55:17,259
I.. I'm your culprit.

1480
01:55:18,264 --> 01:55:21,233
Forgive me, kids. -No, sir..

1481
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:22,354
Open the door!

1482
01:55:23,230 --> 01:55:24,561
Open the door!

1483
01:55:25,165 --> 01:55:25,954
They're here..

1484
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:27,554
Girja.

1485
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:29,588
See who is there.

1486
01:55:29,668 --> 01:55:31,655
No.. don't open the door!

1487
01:55:31,764 --> 01:55:33,356
They'll kill us.

1488
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:35,361
Who will kill you?

1489
01:55:35,726 --> 01:55:36,654
My tribesmen.

1490
01:55:37,172 --> 01:55:38,464
Don't worry.

1491
01:55:38,697 --> 01:55:42,326
As long as I'm alive, nobody can
kill you in this mansion.

1492
01:55:42,663 --> 01:55:45,462
I'm living for you two.

1493
01:55:45,788 --> 01:55:49,191
It's my penance to protect you.

1494
01:55:49,564 --> 01:55:52,297
Girja, bring the gun.

1495
01:55:53,686 --> 01:55:57,864
One day I had raised
weapon to kill you.

1496
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:02,359
And today,
I'll raise weapon to protect you.

1497
01:56:04,571 --> 01:56:05,426
No, sir. Give me the gun.

1498
01:56:05,506 --> 01:56:07,829
No, son. Let me do my duty.

1499
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:09,158
You get back.

1500
01:56:11,155 --> 01:56:12,457
Where are they?

1501
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,105
They're here.

1502
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:17,657
Greetings, sage.

1503
01:56:18,230 --> 01:56:21,945
You and your men are welcome,
chief.

1504
01:56:22,884 --> 01:56:26,786
But is this the way to
enter the mansion?

1505
01:56:27,051 --> 01:56:30,714
The girl you're hiding behind
your gun is my daughter.

1506
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:33,416
Kunwar had kidnapped my girl.

1507
01:56:33,517 --> 01:56:35,883
He has tried to dishonor
the gypsies.

1508
01:56:35,984 --> 01:56:37,315
He's our culprit.

1509
01:56:37,417 --> 01:56:39,942
This mansion has sheltered
our culprit.

1510
01:56:40,499 --> 01:56:44,351
This girl has the right
on this mansion.

1511
01:56:44,922 --> 01:56:46,749
She has come home.

1512
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:50,586
And if you don't understand..

1513
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:54,980
..then think they both
are under my shelter.

1514
01:56:55,917 --> 01:57:00,752
To reach them,
you've to cross over my corpse.

1515
01:57:01,002 --> 01:57:04,343
It doesn't make a difference.
I can kill him too.

1516
01:57:06,684 --> 01:57:10,245
Whose corpse will lie here..

1517
01:57:10,584 --> 01:57:12,449
..isn't sure now, boy.

1518
01:57:13,284 --> 01:57:15,878
But first corpse can be yours too.

1519
01:57:16,231 --> 01:57:17,750
I've no enmity with you.

1520
01:57:17,978 --> 01:57:20,285
We just want Kunwar,
dead or alive.

1521
01:57:20,384 --> 01:57:22,716
If you even dare to take
Kunwar's name..

1522
01:57:23,384 --> 01:57:25,477
..I'll spread corpses here.

1523
01:57:25,817 --> 01:57:26,841
Mr. Rana.

1524
01:57:26,921 --> 01:57:28,384
This isn't your mansion.

1525
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:31,552
And you freed us from
your loyalty..

1526
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:33,482
Come to your sense, gypsy.

1527
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:37,381
You teach magic to your girls..

1528
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:40,871
..so that they can woo boys
of rich family. -Dad.

1529
01:57:40,951 --> 01:57:41,975
Be quiet.

1530
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:44,843
I'll shoot this girl.

1531
01:57:45,501 --> 01:57:46,782
Wait, Rana.

1532
01:57:47,762 --> 01:57:50,743
Bullets don't understand
relationship.

1533
01:57:51,551 --> 01:57:53,519
Once you shoot..

1534
01:57:54,031 --> 01:57:57,023
..you've nothing but repentance.

1535
01:57:58,082 --> 01:58:03,286
You're going to make the same
mistake that I did years ago.

1536
01:58:04,001 --> 01:58:07,378
And because of that,
for 50 years..

1537
01:58:08,551 --> 01:58:12,578
..I'm repenting for
Suraj and Devi.

1538
01:58:13,691 --> 01:58:15,380
Suraj? -Devi?

1539
01:58:16,261 --> 01:58:18,637
But sage,
she's my daughter Reshma.

1540
01:58:18,717 --> 01:58:20,509
Everyone says this.

1541
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:23,811
She too thinks so.

1542
01:58:24,477 --> 01:58:26,651
But I know..

1543
01:58:26,996 --> 01:58:28,851
..Girja knows..

1544
01:58:29,229 --> 01:58:32,418
..the old people of this
village knows..

1545
01:58:32,678 --> 01:58:37,344
..that 50 years ago she
was my daughter.

1546
01:58:40,421 --> 01:58:43,449
Look at this portrait, chief.

1547
01:58:43,814 --> 01:58:45,818
Maybe you'll understand.

1548
01:58:54,207 --> 01:58:55,679
This is the same portrait..

1549
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:59,887
..that my son had made without
seeing the girl.

1550
01:59:00,376 --> 01:59:04,544
Maybe the face of Devi
of previous life..

1551
01:59:05,294 --> 01:59:07,678
..is still remembered by Kunwar.

1552
01:59:07,899 --> 01:59:09,175
Previous life?

1553
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:10,841
Yes, Rana.

1554
01:59:11,706 --> 01:59:15,844
50 years ago,
they had previous life.

1555
01:59:18,519 --> 01:59:20,912
This area wasn't barren
at that time.

1556
01:59:21,705 --> 01:59:23,479
There was greenery.

1557
01:59:24,668 --> 01:59:27,252
When my daughter and Suraj left..

1558
01:59:27,688 --> 01:59:30,181
..they took greenery with them.

1559
01:59:31,438 --> 01:59:35,712
Chief, your daughter Reshma..

1560
01:59:36,932 --> 01:59:40,744
..was my only daughter Devi.

1561
01:59:41,626 --> 01:59:47,153
And Rana,
your son Kunwar used to be Suraj.

1562
01:59:53,751 --> 01:59:56,686
Suraj was son of gypsy Lakhiya.

1563
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:01,082
Lakhiya used to bring
herbs for me.

1564
02:00:01,545 --> 02:00:05,552
His son Suraj used
to come with him.

1565
02:00:07,213 --> 02:00:08,408
One night..

1566
02:00:09,575 --> 02:00:11,117
..Suraj came alone.

1567
02:00:12,299 --> 02:00:14,417
He had fear in his eyes.

1568
02:00:15,505 --> 02:00:17,575
His clothes were ripped.

1569
02:00:19,269 --> 02:00:23,080
I learnt that Lakhiya was
killed in family feud.

1570
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:28,617
And his enemies were looking
for his son Suraj.

1571
02:00:30,643 --> 02:00:32,708
To save Suraj's life..

1572
02:00:33,577 --> 02:00:35,379
..I sheltered him in mansion.

1573
02:00:37,126 --> 02:00:38,784
My daughter Devi..

1574
02:00:39,416 --> 02:00:43,576
..and Lakhiya's son Suraj
grew up together.

1575
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:48,445
But my proud eyes couldn't see..

1576
02:00:49,484 --> 02:00:54,148
..that their love too
was blossoming.

1577
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:42,118
Whenever I get life..

1578
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:52,522
..I wish to get your
Love every time.

1579
02:01:53,140 --> 02:02:13,665
Whenever I get life, I wish to
get your love every time..

1580
02:02:13,745 --> 02:02:19,583
Whenever I get life..

1581
02:02:40,443 --> 02:02:45,810
With some promises and vows..

1582
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:51,145
With some promises and vows..

1583
02:02:51,251 --> 02:02:59,404
..we're tied from lifetimes.

1584
02:02:59,484 --> 02:03:04,444
Whenever we separate and meet..

1585
02:03:04,551 --> 02:03:15,070
..I wish to get your
Love every time.

1586
02:03:15,150 --> 02:03:30,931
Whenever I get life, I wish to
get your love every time..

1587
02:04:13,223 --> 02:04:18,386
The flow of life..

1588
02:04:18,591 --> 02:04:23,251
The flow of life..

1589
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:28,653
..is like the flowing river.

1590
02:04:28,917 --> 02:04:33,547
..is like the flowing river.

1591
02:04:33,768 --> 02:04:39,055
We'll meet whether
here or there..

1592
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:43,952
We'll meet whether
here or there..

1593
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:54,222
..I wish to get your
Love every time.

1594
02:04:54,317 --> 02:04:59,254
Whenever I get life..

1595
02:04:59,350 --> 02:05:11,195
..I wish to get your
Love every time.

1596
02:05:11,943 --> 02:05:12,963
Thakur!

1597
02:05:13,043 --> 02:05:14,510
Why did you get up, Thakur?

1598
02:05:14,806 --> 02:05:17,604
Thakur Natwar Singh,
I got up because..

1599
02:05:17,969 --> 02:05:19,186
..you're our guest.

1600
02:05:19,266 --> 02:05:21,815
Or else your corpses would've
been lying here.

1601
02:05:21,895 --> 02:05:23,118
Thakur!

1602
02:05:23,198 --> 02:05:26,322
You want to marry your
son to my daughter.

1603
02:05:26,653 --> 02:05:28,156
He's still drunk.

1604
02:05:28,687 --> 02:05:31,391
He visits brothels.

1605
02:05:31,494 --> 02:05:33,428
These are hobbies of rich people,
Thakur.

1606
02:05:33,927 --> 02:05:37,886
Is it because of his
hobbies that..

1607
02:05:38,112 --> 02:05:40,581
..his first wife committed suicide
4 days after marriage..

1608
02:05:40,661 --> 02:05:42,253
..and the second one
after 6 months?

1609
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:45,418
I want a husband for my daughter..

1610
02:05:46,249 --> 02:05:48,594
..but your son is like
a wood of pyre.

1611
02:05:49,528 --> 02:05:53,024
Before I cremate both of you,
get out of my mansion.

1612
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:54,546
Go.

1613
02:05:54,626 --> 02:05:55,418
Come.

1614
02:06:05,627 --> 02:06:08,494
Girja, Devi isn't home.
Where is she?

1615
02:06:11,073 --> 02:06:13,095
Where is Devi?

1616
02:06:14,494 --> 02:06:17,088
Sir,
Suraj turned out to be disloyal.

1617
02:06:17,941 --> 02:06:20,962
He has wooed your daughter and
taken her to the riverbank..

1618
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:24,262
Gypsy Lakhiya's son
has dared so much!

1619
02:06:25,027 --> 02:06:28,360
He wants to dishonor this mansion.

1620
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:30,085
Girja.

1621
02:06:30,268 --> 02:06:32,595
Bring him to me.

1622
02:06:34,674 --> 02:06:37,324
But think of Devi too, sir.

1623
02:06:37,541 --> 02:06:39,258
What's there to think about her?

1624
02:06:39,961 --> 02:06:43,362
If she wants to enter filth,
will we let her?

1625
02:06:43,961 --> 02:06:47,658
Thakur's daughters are married
as per their parents' wish.

1626
02:06:49,094 --> 02:06:52,996
Next month I'll get Devi married
to Vir Singh's son.

1627
02:06:55,025 --> 02:06:57,086
Suraj's life can't be a problem,
sir.

1628
02:06:58,027 --> 02:07:00,996
If you command, I'll kill him.

1629
02:07:05,961 --> 02:07:06,985
Devi!

1630
02:07:07,759 --> 02:07:09,859
How could he even think
of killing Suraj?

1631
02:07:11,388 --> 02:07:13,957
And whose marriage are
you talking about?

1632
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:16,120
I'm talking of your marriage.

1633
02:07:16,875 --> 02:07:18,323
If Girja kills Suraj..

1634
02:07:18,994 --> 02:07:20,621
..then with whom will
you get me married?

1635
02:07:23,485 --> 02:07:26,886
You want to marry the gypsy who
has been living on our mercy.

1636
02:07:28,894 --> 02:07:29,918
Yes, father.

1637
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:34,019
You'll be tired of hitting me..

1638
02:07:35,075 --> 02:07:36,427
..but my answer won't change.

1639
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:38,892
Your answer won't change..

1640
02:07:39,472 --> 02:07:41,987
..so to protect the honor
of this mansion..

1641
02:07:42,625 --> 02:07:44,821
..I'll buy you alive
in this mansion.

1642
02:07:45,272 --> 02:07:48,260
You can try that too.
And if you do so..

1643
02:07:49,273 --> 02:07:51,289
..I'll take second birth
to get Suraj.

1644
02:07:51,975 --> 02:07:53,340
I'll pray to God..

1645
02:07:53,948 --> 02:07:56,241
..that I shouldn't be made daughter
of such a father..

1646
02:07:56,575 --> 02:07:57,735
..who loves mansion..

1647
02:07:58,406 --> 02:08:01,202
..more than his living daughter.

1648
02:08:08,669 --> 02:08:11,197
Sir, you're here..

1649
02:08:11,886 --> 02:08:13,470
You should have called me.

1650
02:08:26,323 --> 02:08:27,915
What can I do for you, sir?

1651
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:30,381
Your life..

1652
02:08:30,904 --> 02:08:32,982
..is my favor on you.

1653
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:34,421
You gypsy boy!

1654
02:08:37,323 --> 02:08:39,794
Devi should've been worthy
of worship for you.

1655
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:42,355
Because she's my daughter.

1656
02:08:43,057 --> 02:08:44,081
But you..

1657
02:08:46,211 --> 02:08:49,615
If my mercy hadn't raised you..

1658
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:53,087
..I swear,
I would've killed you today.

1659
02:08:55,362 --> 02:08:56,986
Get out of my area.

1660
02:08:58,699 --> 02:09:02,084
There is no place for traitors.

1661
02:09:03,191 --> 02:09:05,853
Henceforth if you're
seen in this area..

1662
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:08,517
..I'll burn you alive.

1663
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:11,214
As you say, sir.

1664
02:09:12,823 --> 02:09:14,381
I don't understand
what's my fault.

1665
02:09:14,785 --> 02:09:17,091
If I tell you your fault..

1666
02:09:17,585 --> 02:09:19,415
..then I've to shoot you too.

1667
02:09:20,047 --> 02:09:21,081
Get out!

1668
02:09:29,406 --> 02:09:31,777
Where did you go without
informing, sir? -Where is Devi?

1669
02:09:31,931 --> 02:09:34,474
She's in her room.
-Keep a close eye on her.

1670
02:09:35,038 --> 02:09:36,797
I'm going to meet
Thakur Vir Singh.

1671
02:09:37,068 --> 02:09:39,352
Devi should be married soon.

1672
02:09:39,638 --> 02:09:40,381
Listen..

1673
02:09:40,627 --> 02:09:43,463
..if Suraj is seen near
the mansion shoot him.

1674
02:09:45,667 --> 02:09:46,793
Don't worry, sir.

1675
02:09:47,567 --> 02:09:50,397
I don't have to worry
when you're here.

1676
02:09:50,697 --> 02:09:52,200
Your loyalty..

1677
02:09:52,397 --> 02:09:54,662
..is an example for everyone.

1678
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:39,892
You're here, Devi?

1679
02:10:40,734 --> 02:10:41,758
Did anyone see you?

1680
02:10:41,943 --> 02:10:43,125
What if they do?

1681
02:10:43,734 --> 02:10:45,599
Did I come to meet you
for the first time?

1682
02:10:46,392 --> 02:10:47,695
It was different earlier.

1683
02:10:48,567 --> 02:10:50,091
But now you're getting married.

1684
02:10:50,962 --> 02:10:52,329
If someone sees you with me..

1685
02:10:52,601 --> 02:10:54,466
..there will be a problem
in your marriage.

1686
02:10:55,161 --> 02:10:56,360
Do you think..

1687
02:10:56,609 --> 02:10:59,067
..I'll marry a stranger?

1688
02:10:59,592 --> 02:11:01,128
This is your father's decision.

1689
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:02,659
You know very well..

1690
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:05,168
..that when your father
makes any decision..

1691
02:11:05,434 --> 02:11:07,595
..then nobody can change it.

1692
02:11:08,734 --> 02:11:11,225
I want to know your decision.

1693
02:11:12,467 --> 02:11:13,491
My decision?

1694
02:11:13,734 --> 02:11:14,758
Yes.

1695
02:11:15,241 --> 02:11:17,258
Because father is high
on his pride and ego.

1696
02:11:17,872 --> 02:11:19,701
He can't judge you.

1697
02:11:20,517 --> 02:11:22,159
So you've only one way.

1698
02:11:23,047 --> 02:11:24,464
Elope with me.

1699
02:11:25,025 --> 02:11:26,398
What are you saying, Devi?

1700
02:11:26,564 --> 02:11:28,366
Try to understand me, Suraj.

1701
02:11:28,667 --> 02:11:30,066
We've no other option.

1702
02:11:30,244 --> 02:11:32,292
Father will never get
me married to you.

1703
02:11:33,425 --> 02:11:34,525
I know that too.

1704
02:11:34,883 --> 02:11:37,696
But it doesn't mean we should be
the reason for his suicide.

1705
02:11:39,734 --> 02:11:42,066
Your father won't be able to
endure this defamation..

1706
02:11:42,267 --> 02:11:44,428
..if you elope with his servant.

1707
02:11:45,052 --> 02:11:46,125
What do you want?

1708
02:11:46,734 --> 02:11:49,362
I should marry the man..

1709
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:51,200
..whom I never saw.

1710
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,021
No, Suraj.

1711
02:11:53,101 --> 02:11:54,125
It won't happen.

1712
02:11:54,853 --> 02:11:57,031
Suraj,
I've seen you as my husband.

1713
02:11:57,719 --> 02:12:00,192
I can be happy only with you.

1714
02:12:01,134 --> 02:12:03,659
Look tomorrow father is taking
marriage proposal.

1715
02:12:03,841 --> 02:12:05,702
We'll go very far before that.

1716
02:12:06,767 --> 02:12:07,908
Yes, Suraj.

1717
02:12:07,988 --> 02:12:10,592
We can run from here,
but not from ourselves.

1718
02:12:11,267 --> 02:12:12,785
My conscience will
always prick me.

1719
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,127
I'll lose my dignity.

1720
02:12:14,234 --> 02:12:17,032
The man who raised this orphan
like his own son..

1721
02:12:17,134 --> 02:12:18,601
..this is how I repaid his favor?

1722
02:12:19,467 --> 02:12:20,491
No, Devi.

1723
02:12:20,749 --> 02:12:21,659
By eloping with you..

1724
02:12:21,892 --> 02:12:23,463
..I can't insult him.

1725
02:12:23,871 --> 02:12:24,961
But..

1726
02:12:25,267 --> 02:12:26,996
..you can insult my love.

1727
02:12:29,043 --> 02:12:30,125
Fine.

1728
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:31,598
You repay your favors.

1729
02:12:32,334 --> 02:12:34,495
I'll jump in the river to repay
the price of my love.

1730
02:12:34,642 --> 02:12:37,161
What are you doing? -Leave me.
-What happened to you?

1731
02:12:37,267 --> 02:12:40,054
Let me die. -Devi.. come to
your senses. -Leave me.

1732
02:12:40,134 --> 02:12:41,426
I say leave me.

1733
02:13:06,274 --> 02:13:07,361
Forgive me, Devi.

1734
02:13:09,491 --> 02:13:12,165
Silly!
Marriage is a union of two bodies.

1735
02:13:12,967 --> 02:13:14,595
Union of hearts is
bigger than that.

1736
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:17,130
We've been in true love.

1737
02:13:17,541 --> 02:13:19,992
True lovers don't defame love.

1738
02:13:21,442 --> 02:13:22,258
Look..

1739
02:13:22,449 --> 02:13:25,543
..promise me that you
won't take any step..

1740
02:13:26,168 --> 02:13:27,302
..to defame..

1741
02:13:27,382 --> 02:13:29,680
..your father and our love.

1742
02:13:37,382 --> 02:13:38,406
Okay..

1743
02:13:39,516 --> 02:13:42,820
So Thakur refused my proposal
for this servant.

1744
02:13:44,887 --> 02:13:46,010
Never mind.

1745
02:13:47,027 --> 02:13:49,050
This girl can't be my wife..

1746
02:13:49,682 --> 02:13:52,116
..but today I'll make
her my slave.

1747
02:13:55,749 --> 02:13:56,773
Sir.

1748
02:13:57,066 --> 02:13:59,413
Forgive me.

1749
02:13:59,782 --> 02:14:00,806
What happened?

1750
02:14:00,886 --> 02:14:03,040
There is a disaster!

1751
02:14:03,516 --> 02:14:04,540
Where is Devi?

1752
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:06,308
She isn't in her room.

1753
02:14:07,087 --> 02:14:09,084
What? Where did she go?

1754
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:11,777
I think Suraj eloped with her.

1755
02:14:12,618 --> 02:14:17,317
No..
this can't be true. Bring my gun.

1756
02:14:41,059 --> 02:14:42,107
Leave me!

1757
02:15:38,098 --> 02:15:39,206
Leave me.

1758
02:17:10,013 --> 02:17:11,037
Suraj.

1759
02:17:14,002 --> 02:17:15,207
No, Suraj.

1760
02:17:15,313 --> 02:17:16,611
No, Suraj!

1761
02:17:23,226 --> 02:17:24,338
I'll take you home.

1762
02:17:26,648 --> 02:17:27,803
I won't go home.

1763
02:17:28,687 --> 02:17:29,838
No! -Devi.

1764
02:17:31,281 --> 02:17:33,000
Where are you going, Devi? -Stop!

1765
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:35,014
Only death is my option.

1766
02:17:35,337 --> 02:17:36,304
The one I love..

1767
02:17:36,517 --> 02:17:37,870
..didn't accept me.

1768
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:40,949
I'm not worthy to return to
the house where I was born.

1769
02:17:41,183 --> 02:17:43,072
Why not? That house is yours.

1770
02:17:43,499 --> 02:17:46,174
I can't go because I left
the house for you.

1771
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:47,611
How can I return?

1772
02:17:48,204 --> 02:17:50,967
What will I say for whatever
happened here?

1773
02:17:51,181 --> 02:17:52,207
I'm there to reply.

1774
02:17:52,614 --> 02:17:54,343
In that proud mansion
of egoistic Thakur..

1775
02:17:54,913 --> 02:17:57,934
..who will listen to gypsy Suraj.
-Let me go. -Devi..

1776
02:17:58,013 --> 02:17:59,320
..I won't let you go alone.

1777
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:00,679
You'll come home with me.

1778
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:03,010
I say leave me. -No..

1779
02:18:03,114 --> 02:18:05,912
Leave my hand. I won't go. -No.

1780
02:18:06,114 --> 02:18:07,497
Come with me.

1781
02:18:07,647 --> 02:18:08,739
I won't go.

1782
02:18:08,847 --> 02:18:10,597
Listen to me. -Leave me.

1783
02:18:11,293 --> 02:18:12,253
Leave me. -Devi.

1784
02:18:13,279 --> 02:18:15,000
Don't be mad! -No.

1785
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:16,274
You've to come with me.

1786
02:18:16,465 --> 02:18:17,571
Listen to me.

1787
02:18:17,947 --> 02:18:19,235
Come with me. -Leave!

1788
02:18:20,173 --> 02:18:22,548
Come with me.
Listen to me.

1789
02:18:22,628 --> 02:18:23,414
No, Suraj.

1790
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:27,541
Suraj.

1791
02:18:35,422 --> 02:18:36,681
Suraj!

1792
02:18:40,458 --> 02:18:42,513
Suraj! What happened to you?

1793
02:18:43,183 --> 02:18:44,910
Open your eyes, Suraj.

1794
02:18:45,558 --> 02:18:47,539
Devi, your father has come.

1795
02:18:47,647 --> 02:18:49,323
Now go home.

1796
02:18:49,505 --> 02:18:50,507
You're in no danger.

1797
02:18:50,736 --> 02:18:52,080
Don't say that.

1798
02:18:52,716 --> 02:18:54,731
No.. open your eyes, Suraj.

1799
02:18:56,482 --> 02:19:02,272
Suraj. Suraj! No!

1800
02:19:07,709 --> 02:19:10,671
Girja,
throw this scum's corpse down.

1801
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:12,145
Don't dare to touch him.

1802
02:19:12,385 --> 02:19:14,807
Devi, this was the punishment
of this lowly gypsy.

1803
02:19:14,977 --> 02:19:16,743
He tried to dishonor me.

1804
02:19:17,373 --> 02:19:19,096
Suraj wasn't dishonoring you.

1805
02:19:19,308 --> 02:19:21,844
Mahavir Singh tried
to dishonor you.

1806
02:19:21,924 --> 02:19:23,273
He brought me here.

1807
02:19:23,852 --> 02:19:27,245
If Suraj hadn't come,
you would've been dishonored.

1808
02:19:28,168 --> 02:19:29,508
To save my honor..

1809
02:19:30,125 --> 02:19:31,244
..Suraj killed him.

1810
02:19:31,873 --> 02:19:33,113
Look at his corpse.

1811
02:19:36,915 --> 02:19:38,506
You've done a big sin, father!

1812
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:40,741
You killed an innocent man.

1813
02:19:41,105 --> 02:19:44,980
You killed my Suraj.

1814
02:19:45,876 --> 02:19:46,806
Forgive me, Devi.

1815
02:19:46,913 --> 02:19:48,677
No! Don't touch me.

1816
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:51,445
Don't touch me.

1817
02:19:51,547 --> 02:19:53,201
Devi. Come with me.

1818
02:19:53,547 --> 02:19:57,189
I'm going with Suraj not with you.

1819
02:20:01,198 --> 02:20:02,004
No!

1820
02:20:08,775 --> 02:20:10,809
What did you do, child?

1821
02:20:11,355 --> 02:20:12,978
What have you done?

1822
02:20:13,297 --> 02:20:15,605
The only flaw in Suraj was..

1823
02:20:16,441 --> 02:20:17,657
..he was a gypsy.

1824
02:20:19,614 --> 02:20:22,105
Today with you as my witness..

1825
02:20:22,556 --> 02:20:23,681
..I pray to God..

1826
02:20:24,666 --> 02:20:26,480
..if my love is true..

1827
02:20:27,356 --> 02:20:29,740
..he should make me a gypsy
in every lifetime.

1828
02:20:30,152 --> 02:20:33,442
So that I can get my gypsy.

1829
02:20:34,629 --> 02:20:38,177
Devi! What have I done?

1830
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:39,879
If I had known..

1831
02:20:40,571 --> 02:20:43,768
..that to get Suraj you
would give your life..

1832
02:20:44,038 --> 02:20:45,972
..I swear..

1833
02:20:46,834 --> 02:20:48,981
..I would've made him
my son-in-law.

1834
02:20:50,359 --> 02:20:51,262
Father..

1835
02:20:52,004 --> 02:20:53,870
I can die in peace now.

1836
02:20:54,148 --> 02:20:55,563
I can die in peace now.

1837
02:20:56,171 --> 02:20:58,298
Promise me..

1838
02:20:59,705 --> 02:21:01,263
..that in next life..

1839
02:21:01,538 --> 02:21:03,199
..you'll unite us.

1840
02:21:03,685 --> 02:21:05,136
To get Suraj..

1841
02:21:05,705 --> 02:21:07,764
..I'll be born again.

1842
02:21:08,009 --> 02:21:09,702
Promise me.

1843
02:21:10,571 --> 02:21:11,902
I promise.

1844
02:21:12,113 --> 02:21:13,302
I promise.

1845
02:21:16,905 --> 02:21:18,839
I'll come back with Suraj, father.

1846
02:21:19,119 --> 02:21:19,962
With Suraj..

1847
02:21:21,443 --> 02:21:24,000
Devi! Devi!

1848
02:21:29,429 --> 02:21:34,242
I'll wait for both of you.

1849
02:21:35,314 --> 02:21:37,631
Because of me these kids died,
sir.

1850
02:21:38,401 --> 02:21:40,095
This tongue had lied.

1851
02:21:40,643 --> 02:21:42,898
I'll cut this tongue.

1852
02:21:43,004 --> 02:21:44,344
I'll cut this tongue.

1853
02:21:44,424 --> 02:21:45,731
No, Girja.

1854
02:21:46,287 --> 02:21:48,272
Girja!

1855
02:22:03,848 --> 02:22:07,739
Don't cy, Girja!

1856
02:22:08,838 --> 02:22:13,104
Today our penance is over.

1857
02:22:14,071 --> 02:22:16,505
Thank God..

1858
02:22:17,071 --> 02:22:21,701
..he give us a chance
to unite them.

1859
02:22:30,225 --> 02:22:31,129
Chief.

1860
02:22:32,533 --> 02:22:33,629
Rana.

1861
02:22:34,446 --> 02:22:37,938
We beg of you..

1862
02:22:38,738 --> 02:22:41,434
..the mistake we made..

1863
02:22:41,954 --> 02:22:43,705
..don't repeat it.

1864
02:22:44,471 --> 02:22:45,562
Thakur Baba.

1865
02:22:46,340 --> 02:22:48,701
You've saved me from a big sin.

1866
02:22:50,451 --> 02:22:51,562
But..

1867
02:22:53,138 --> 02:22:54,765
..I've promised Shakti Singh.

1868
02:22:55,971 --> 02:22:57,029
Thakur Baba.

1869
02:22:58,480 --> 02:23:00,005
Reshma is your daughter.

1870
02:23:00,466 --> 02:23:02,631
If you'll give away the
bride in marriage..

1871
02:23:03,971 --> 02:23:05,802
..I free chief from his promise.

1872
02:23:06,071 --> 02:23:07,702
Bless you, son.

1873
02:23:07,971 --> 02:23:08,995
Bless you.

1874
02:23:09,464 --> 02:23:10,596
Thakur Baba.

1875
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:12,663
Reshma is now your daughter.

1876
02:23:13,171 --> 02:23:14,934
Now it's between you and Rana!

1877
02:23:15,038 --> 02:23:16,630
No, chief Manik.

1878
02:23:17,517 --> 02:23:19,801
We learnt today..

1879
02:23:20,638 --> 02:23:22,196
..what we should have
known earlier.

1880
02:23:25,747 --> 02:23:28,799
Lovers have a code of honor..

1881
02:23:29,634 --> 02:23:31,536
..and a duty to fulfil.

1882
02:23:33,122 --> 02:23:37,135
Today I'm going to do something
a Rajput never did.

1883
02:23:40,744 --> 02:23:44,631
Forgive me, daughter.

1884
02:23:46,056 --> 02:23:49,466
I said many wrong
things about you.

1885
02:23:52,190 --> 02:23:53,029
Bless you.

1886
02:23:55,571 --> 02:23:58,199
One thing is decided..

1887
02:23:58,529 --> 02:24:01,463
..that Thakur Baba will
give away the bride..

1888
02:24:01,871 --> 02:24:05,864
..and marriage will be as per
the gypsy traditions..

1889
02:24:06,471 --> 02:24:07,961
..in your tent.

1890
02:24:10,372 --> 02:24:12,996
Did you hear?

1891
02:24:13,671 --> 02:24:14,695
Did you hear?

1892
02:24:15,267 --> 02:24:16,796
Clouds are thundering.

1893
02:24:17,471 --> 02:24:20,998
It seems after years
it will rain here.

1894
02:24:21,657 --> 02:24:25,163
This land will be free
from the curse.

1895
02:24:25,314 --> 02:24:27,694
There will be greenery again.

1896
02:24:27,774 --> 02:24:30,169
There will be greenery again.

1897
02:25:13,638 --> 02:25:18,769
Whenever I get life..

1898
02:25:18,871 --> 02:25:28,712
..I wish to get your
Love every time.
