00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:04,731
Hello.

3
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:40,967
Come. Come.

4
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,641
Get in and see.

5
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,738
Come with us.
- Sir, let me say something.

6
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,145
You need not say anything,
we will make you talk.

7
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,482
Rajesh..
- what, sir?

8
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,488
Isn't it quite late? Let them go to sleep.
- Go and sleep.

9
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,828
Then good night.

10
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,863
what happened to them?

11
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,757
When everyone got together
then they became softer?

12
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,594
Now it has become
a Mantrika police station, isn't it?

13
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,326
So they became soft.

14
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,175
Balachandra, did you have dinner?

15
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,674
Just when l was about to
have it l was brought here.

16
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,403
Hey, don't say that.
That is an accusation.

17
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,342
we were just bringing
you here, weren't we?

18
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,073
Sir.
- what?

19
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,445
l want to go to loo.
- Okay.

20
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,616
Sir, l too want to.
- Go ahead.

21
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:47,204
Since morning l was acting.
Now you can go and piddle.

22
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,042
Now l can sleep peacefully.

23
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,312
lf l wanted to steal, then should
l get in my own house, sir?

24
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,050
Own house?

25
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,226
This is not a lie, sir, l swear.
That is a house in which l stay.

26
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,625
l see, then you were practicing climbing
on the wall at midnight, isn't it?

27
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,000
lf you were in my state you
too would do the same. - why?

28
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,896
Since many months
l haven't paid rent, sir.

29
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,731
House owner locked the
gate and front door.

30
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,406
Shouldn't l lie down somewhere
and sleep?

31
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,906
lf people know that l have come, not only
the house-owner but all the lenders will come.

32
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,178
That is why l climbed
the wall at midnight.

33
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,848
Sir, his.. No, this sir's car has been brought.
The number plate is not genuine.

34
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,812
You want to go loo?
- No, sir.

35
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,748
Then you stole the car.
You must at least admit that. Please.

36
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,090
No, sir. Truly that is my own car.
l bought the car taking a loan.

37
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,425
But all l paid was just one installment.

38
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,362
So that the finance company people
should not come and take the car,

39
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,935
l have changed the number plate.

40
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,500
For taking so much loan did you
take some single number lottery?

41
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,765
Or did you go to a horserace?

42
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,944
No, sir. l founded an event
management organization.

43
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,443
what l had on hand, the amount
l took on high interest bank loan,

44
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,105
all together l put in for the first time
l conducted a star show.- Then..

45
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,445
The first programme itself flopped, sir.

46
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,622
Now l have a loan of about
4 million rupees.

47
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,697
Ha! My mother, l was not late.

48
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,959
when our relative Johnny told
l came to know about it.

49
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,637
immediately l sat in my car
and came here.

50
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,131
Sir, you must give him to me.
- what?

51
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,900
No, on bail.
Now no one else knows.

52
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,805
lf they find it out many others
who have lent him money..

53
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,640
will be here in no time to get him
out on bail. He is such a big man.

54
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,152
Sir, he is the one gives money
on high interest.

55
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,821
l have to give him 400000 rupees.

56
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,319
lf you give me to him..

57
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,822
..till the time l don't pay all his
money he won't show me daylight.

58
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,324
Sir, loom into his car.
All of them are goons.

59
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:56,495
He is a man who has helped me a lot.
l can only repay in such ways, isn't it?

60
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,499
Yes, you wait outside for a while.

61
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,171
when you have to sign on
the bail form l will call you.

62
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,234
who is this calling at this time?

63
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,043
Called many times, didn't you?

64
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,603
Surya.

65
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,844
The girl who l am engaged to.

66
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,688
You indebted man, with all this
you want to get married as well?

67
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,788
Sir.
- what?

68
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,356
lt is Mantrika station, sir.

69
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:26,824
Oh! when you've so much loans & problems
is it right to get married, Balachandran?

70
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,934
when l didn't have any loans
my family had fixed it.

71
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,694
From a big family in Tirissur.

72
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,030
when they came to know, l was down
they themselves decided not to go ahead.

73
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:40,736
in between we called,
met and came very close.- Then..

74
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,046
Love?

75
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,045
My age has gone beyond
all that, hasn't it?

76
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,619
Yet you can say it is
something like that.

77
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,056
it is four-five years since she
is opposing her father.

78
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,488
Shouldn't my problems get over?

79
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:00,727
Now no problem,
at dawn she is getting married.

80
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,398
Then why is she calling?

81
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,333
You go..

82
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,736
Sir..
- Go, man.

83
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,608
Then when the girl calls you
again you must pick up the phone.

84
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,281
it must be to say bye to you.

85
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,344
Sir, if you call Fareed inside
l can go out.

86
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,754
Fareed..
- Sir, did you call me?

87
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,588
Rajesh..
- Sir.

88
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,092
Call his friends inside
who are there in the car.- Okay sir

89
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,429
Sir...move a side.

90
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,265
Now sir, where is he going?
- He is going to pee.

91
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,767
My dear sir, don't let him go.

92
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,268
He isn't going to pee
He is going to run away.

93
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,771
Fareed, now if l have to leave you.

94
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,942
Two people should take you out on bail.

95
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,940
Call them quickly.
- what?

96
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,783
Surya, since l don't have anything special
to tell you l didn't pick up the call.

97
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,618
But l have to talk to you.
l have to tell you in person.

98
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,454
l am at the railway station.
- Here? Now at this time?

99
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,299
Came in the evening.
Since then l am calling.

100
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,401
l have booked two tickets on
the Delhi train in the morning.

101
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,303
lf you come before that we
both will go together.

102
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:20,309
Or l will go alone,
but it won't be to Delhi.

103
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,247
Hey, stop there.
Don't take it. Hey, hello.

104
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,496
what is it? what happened?

105
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,498
Sir, l need Rs.100 as a loan.
The recovery agent people took my car.

106
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,605
l see. Fareed, get me Rs.200.

107
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,332
Isn't 150 enough, after reducing first interest?
- Get it soon, man.

108
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,509
Here.

109
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,170
Here. Spend it carefully.

110
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,245
Hey, reduce one month's
interest get me out on bail.

111
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,353
Oh God!

112
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,513
Is the Delhi train gone?
- That is gone.

113
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:25,934
Central

114
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,648
Even after having so many problems..

115
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,723
..l had never thought of
committing suicide in life.

116
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,893
l am telling the truth,
now l feel like doing so.

117
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,884
Then l will wait till the next train.

118
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,222
Surya, listen to what l am saying.

119
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,661
Disobeyed my dad and said no to the
marriage and came out of the house.

120
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,731
That was not to commit suicide.

121
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,332
lf that was the case l had all the
necessary facilities at my house.

122
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,561
That is my problem.

123
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,673
l don't have a place or a house
even to commit suicide.

124
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,671
l am on the road now.

125
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,071
Surya, when my problem
with the bank is over..

126
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,247
and when l am able to sell my property
only that day my problems will be over.

127
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,813
Till then what you will do?

128
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,745
when l called last week what
did Balachandran say?- what?

129
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:13,914
The Berlin wall collapsed in no time.
ln one night the world war stopped.

130
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,753
You said some magical thing will
take place in our case also.

131
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,588
Isn't that what you said?

132
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,699
Just Balachandran, l too believe the same
that such a thing is going to happen.

133
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:26,031
Dear, l don't have such trust.
This is a game that has been left off.

134
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,933
Now itself your dad and relatives must
have gone all over in your search.

135
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,870
Along with them the police also.
l won't have an answer before them.

136
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:37,606
Let anyone come, dad or the
police all l need is just a string.

137
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,617
One holy thread.
Somewhere in the temple.

138
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:47,685
For my assurance and to
touch and show to anyone.

139
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,622
Hey, that is enough for
your assurance.

140
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,223
But on what assurance
do l take you with me?

141
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,458
Now you have become sure
that your luck will never change?

142
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,659
Don't you need a company?

143
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,703
why should you face all
these problems all alone?

144
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,144
Can't it be together?

145
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,976
Come.

146
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,322
where to?

147
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,928
Now totally how much
do you have in your bag?

148
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,662
Rs. 650 and some change.

149
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,497
Oh! we can get 10 cents
land next to the secretariat..

150
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,172
..and build a house with it. Come.

151
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,836
One single room bath attached.
- Rs. 600.

152
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,508
we just need it for two hours.
Just to freshen up.

153
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,444
Then give Rs. 300.

154
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,113
l will call later.

155
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,190
They too came to freshen up.
But they took only one hour.

156
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,032
Hey, all l have is that Kichu.
But he is not picking up the phone.

157
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,207
He is a production controller
in the films.

158
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,103
Maybe he is busy in shooting.

159
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,451
Madam, more energy.

160
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,326
Smile.

161
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,196
Stop it.

162
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,100
Girlie, what is this?
There is no excuse in the stage.

163
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,770
Neither the viewers not the judges
want to know your mental problems.

164
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:39,995
Sorry, sir.
- Sorry.

165
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,763
l don't think l will be able to do it, sir.

166
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,534
when sir insisted since l didn't
have alternative, l came to do it.

167
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,372
Hey! Cut. Nonsense, this the 12th take.
There is no timing or anything.

168
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,105
How many times should we tell you?

169
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,941
This is a very emotional situation.
You need not act and smash anything.

170
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,621
You just need to behave.

171
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,950
All around you people are
shooting a film, understood?

172
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,024
Chacko, let us try once again.

173
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,118
Should l see full or..
- No need.

174
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,453
what?

175
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:09,130
Look at the dialogue after Chacko.
- How much would that be?

176
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,394
From where did you get this one?
l will just throw it and leave.

177
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,801
weren't you insisting on a new face?
She had acted in a reality show.

178
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,805
Is it so? l didn't know that.

179
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,843
Actually what is wrong with
that girl in this?

180
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,980
weren't all her emotions correct?

181
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,540
Now will you get up and go
before my emotion changes?

182
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,651
This is what is ego.
- Oh!

183
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,082
Hey, man, who am l in this film?
- Producer.

184
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,384
l am, isn't it? Now go and tell him that.
- Okay.

185
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,489
Ah, ready. Chacko. Ready, take.

186
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,422
Take thirteen..
- Action.

187
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,260
Sorry, sir, l don't think l will be able to.

188
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,097
when sir insisted..
- Oh cut.

189
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,512
Sir should continue with this comedy?

190
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:57,849
Pack up.

191
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,620
Now we will be shooting only after
getting a girl who can perform well.

192
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,518
Call me after getting one.
- l will call your father and mother.

193
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:07,519
what?

194
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,188
l have pawned the papers of my
house and have started doing this film.

195
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,695
You only have to say
some damn thing and go.

196
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,696
l have three daughters.

197
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,530
My dear Paul, why should l fret if one
has to do something with any person?

198
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,968
First wish that we should
make a good film.

199
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,473
Now Reggie, what is the
problem with that girl?

200
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,374
we can't make her act. She is
good to take home and adopt her.

201
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,807
where is he?
That production controller.

202
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,212
My mother, is there such a
fortune line like this also?

203
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,446
Straight line from the moon
mount and a star mark.

204
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,218
Along with that a white spot.

205
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,894
Dear, you are very good girl.

206
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:47,657
To give you...that is not the word
no hesitation to present you.

207
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:51,833
Now let me see that of the
other girl. Get it here.

208
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,571
Right up to the Saturn area your
fortune is in the films.- Enough.

209
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,243
Now see my hand too.

210
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,505
Sakuntala, how many times l have
seen your hand and am fed up.

211
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,648
Now let me see of those
whose hand l haven't seen.

212
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,579
Then go. You will come to see again.

213
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,252
This is the problem with these women.

214
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,183
lf angry, then immediately
they will make faces.

215
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,981
lf they agree their tummy will come up.

216
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,751
l can see another area between
your moon area and controlling area.

217
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,327
Look at this hand, man.

218
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,091
See if my spots can be clearly seen you
the one who messes up my production.

219
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,098
The director said pack and went away.

220
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,533
what is the problem today?
- it seems that girl won't do.

221
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,105
Go somewhere and get a girl with
whom he will be able to manage.

222
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,767
l have even pawned my house
and am standing helpless here.

223
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,606
He doesn't want to know anything.

224
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,109
Sir, you don't fret.

225
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,613
There are scenes that are there
where the heroine isn't there.

226
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,115
That will be enough to shoot
for the next 2-3 days.

227
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,778
By then, this Kichhu will bring a good girl.

228
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,786
Is that enough?

229
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,288
l am walking with money
to buy a bottle of poison.

230
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,630
lf it becomes a problem l will mix it
and give all of you including you.

231
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,958
what have l done now?

232
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,734
You don't have to mix that.
it is not for getting married, is it?

233
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,874
Give that. it is for making
a heroine, isn't it?

234
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,978
You see l will get 4-5 best girls and
make them stand in front of you.

235
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,306
Take the one you want,
the rest you just send them back.

236
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,641
Is that enough?

237
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,820
Now from where will l get 4-5 of them?

238
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,422
ln my list only the half blind
Ambili Chechi is there.

239
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,426
Balu, shall l aIso come?

240
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,826
No, l will just see him and come soon.

241
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,829
Hey, Balu, Kunjacko Boban.

242
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,003
Call me tomorrow

243
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,829
Hey, talk in low voice.

244
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,003
Please, Balu take an autograph from him.

245
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,176
Hey, you will get something from me.
Just be quiet.

246
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,175
Okay, just move, let me see him.

247
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,846
Okay.

248
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,515
Hey, l am fed up of him.

249
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,687
Even after l cut fifty times can't
he stop calling? No respect.

250
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,016
Hey, how come you are here?

251
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,516
Then you called from local range.

252
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,629
Yes. To cut 50 times when l call,
l haven't taken any money from you, did l?

253
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,026
No. But l have to give you, right?

254
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,692
Hey, l don't have to give you 5 millions
to call me so many times, right?

255
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:10,204
Just Rs.2462, isn't it?
Now l will give it right now.

256
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,310
Hey. Hey. l didn't come for that now.
- Then?

257
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,210
You must help me now.
l have a small problem.

258
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,540
Problems are your birthright, aren't they?

259
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,718
A new check case has come,
must take you out on bail.

260
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,819
Now l don't have any more of that form.

261
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,717
Otherwise Kundakkadu Fareed and
his goons are coming to beat you.

262
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,825
My dear, Balu l can't get beaten
along with you anymore.

263
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,995
Hey, all that is not the problem now.
- Then?

264
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,060
l have to get married.

265
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,895
Aren't problems enough?
Now you want to get married aIso?

266
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,135
Have you gone mad or something?

267
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,567
Surya. Surya has come out with me.

268
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,739
lf l don't get rid of him
l will be in a mess.

269
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,836
l see, then l will surely
come for the marriage.

270
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,346
There will be three types
of sweet pudding, isn't it?

271
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,416
l am busy for the next two days, man.

272
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,851
Hey! You just listen to the matter.
- Only listening won't do son, will it?

273
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,422
Just tying the holy thread in the temple.
- That is alright.

274
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,820
The temple committee people say
that without relatives that is not possible.

275
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:04,519
l see.

276
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,857
lf you can supply some relatives..

277
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,590
Yes, l walk around with
your relatives in my pocket.

278
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,859
How many do you want?
- Not that, man.

279
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,004
You get relatives in hundreds for
a marriage in cinema, isn't it? - Yes.

280
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,868
ln my original marriage
can't you get ten relatives for me?

281
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:22,204
Okay. For the Junior artist you need
to pay Rs.350 per head as payment.

282
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,381
That l will give.

283
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,949
Then when you see the account between
us then the balance will come to me only.

284
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,517
And you needn't pay that to me aIso.

285
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,780
But one thing. with this
the help you want from me..

286
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,049
should stop once and for all.
Is that okay?- Okay

287
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,825
Then the rest l will take care.

288
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,360
Sebastian, ask 10 junior artists
to get in the van.

289
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,291
what's the movie?

290
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,891
Stupid groom and unconscious bride.
- who is the director?

291
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,125
Your father, start the van.

292
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,369
Stop. All of you get down quickly
and come with happiness.

293
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,567
Let us do away with peace
from one more man's life.

294
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,641
Shakuntala, if you get snack made
of ghee keep some aside for me.

295
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,814
l like it a lot.

296
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,576
why call people on rent and
disguise them as relatives?

297
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,647
As l had no other alternative,
l did so.

298
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,651
This is Kichhu. Kichhu boss.
Brother is our local guardian.- what?

299
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,326
The one called production
executive in cinema. He is that.

300
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:14,989
l manage and control the directors
and actors in the cinema. lt is a big job.

301
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,931
For now the mother, father uncles and aunts
of the bride and groom all of you come.

302
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,833
Here is the holy thread.

303
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,664
Just a minute.

304
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:25,331
while this thread is tied l will say action
then all of you shower on them flowers.

305
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,513
Sarasu, this is not a shooting,
hence there is no retake.

306
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,545
Now tie it. Action.

307
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,013
Now put this aIso on her.
That rite is aIso there.

308
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:44,552
Central

309
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,027
where to go, what to do?
All that we have to decide now.

310
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,267
Great. A couple who are
very farsighted.

311
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,702
lf only she had some job then l could
put her in the working women's hostel.

312
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,206
You shameless fellow,
even then you won't go to work?

313
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,545
lf you have a job which l can
do without being seen..

314
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,544
..by the people whom l owe,
then give it to me. l will do it.

315
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,548
Surya, what happened?

316
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,247
Father..

317
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,421
Hey, where?

318
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,590
Not that. l was thinking of him.

319
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,694
when there're so many things to be sad
about for now give your dad some holidays.

320
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,659
lf l could get 3-4 days time.

321
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,993
l would have seen her father pacify him
and at least send her to her house.

322
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,293
l won't go back.

323
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,369
Then what you want,
you newly married couple decide.

324
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,041
For now keep this with you,
as a gift from me.

325
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,646
Then sometimes you should think about me.
Only just think, don't come and trouble me.

326
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,315
My dear... Please.
- Hey, leave my hand.

327
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,984
Hey, you don't leave me in lurch.

328
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,552
lf l don't leave your hand now you won't
leave my hand for my whole lifetime.

329
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:48,283
A home, a job, cot expenses, childbirth
expenses, naming ceremony, etc. etc.

330
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,394
My dear, from this minute
l don't even know you at all.

331
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,461
But l know only you.

332
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:57,066
Don't give anything eIse, just give me a
place to stay for tonight. Only that you do.

333
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,829
You will say that now, Tomorrow morning

334
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,911
Now one day..
- Okay.

335
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,171
Not a day, just one night.

336
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,645
Some sort of round about game
is needed to be played.

337
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,478
Then we will see in the evening.

338
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,281
Till then adjust somewhere,
in some park, bar or shopping.

339
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,958
You have a lot of money, don't you?
Become a little lavish.

340
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,162
when he said hotel, l didn't think
it will be such a big hotel.

341
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,739
Very good. Very good.

342
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:38,637
Come.

343
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,412
God, the producer and
director shouldn't see.

344
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,480
Give that to me.
And quickly follow me.

345
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,477
Hold this.

346
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,555
There is a room that was booked
or the heroine in production expenses.

347
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,986
Since that woman was sent off
it is empty now.

348
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,285
lt is that room l am going to
adjust for you both now.

349
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,986

Come. Come.

352
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,105
Just for absolute necessity,
you must come out of room.

353
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,178
Don't order even a glass of lemon juice.

354
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,009
l will arrange food for you both
from the mess.

355
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,980
For today don't have non-veg.

356
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,915
Then if we could have some
sweet pudding aIso then..

357
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,612
Oh it is correct, today is
your wedding day, isn't it?

358
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:30,056
Then not only sweet pudding,
we will make it full 18 course meal.

359
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,924
lf it is not much trouble for you, then..

Hey, go in fast.
l will cut your hands.

363
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,983
Got saved, no one saw it.

364
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,750
Kichhu.
- Oh mother, what?

365
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,049
That packet.

366
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,057
Oh come quickly.

367
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,162
Sorry, l forgot to take it.
- This is now a grave for me.

368
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,544
Hey, you!
- l have lost my job.

369
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,909
Come here man.

370
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,417
Don't bit me.

371
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,755
You are really good.
You are the controller.

372
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:43,123
when you said you will get the heroine l didn't
think that you would get her so soon.

373
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,270
l saw her, she looks good, man.

374
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,772
Oh l see. lt goes that way?

375
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:53,604
But you don't become happy so soon.
Shouldn't we see if the director will like her?

376
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:59,114
Then not only this girl tomorrow the next day,
more beautiful girIs are coming.

377
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,548
when they all come, take their
interviews let the director decide.

378
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,382
That is the proper way to do it.
- That is not the way to do it.

379
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,751
Let that director see this girl
as soon as possible.

380
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,790
Call that girl here.
- what for?

381
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,691
To get to know her well.

382
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,421
Let me change my dress and come.

383
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,067
That won't do.
- what?

384
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,567
what if that girl has changed her dress?

385
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,070
That girl is doing yoga, Kukudasan.

386
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,535
Then let the director come.

387
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,143
Now for that the director
is not in his room.

388
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,245
He has gone for a big meeting.
He will be late.

389
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,176
Now let it be done tomorrow.
lt can be done tomorrow.

390
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,816
Call him on the phone.

391
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,516
l won't call.
- You don't, l will call.

392
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,212
He will make their first night a mess.

393
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,891
Hey, first night?

394
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:45,051
Yes. No, that girl came here and
it is her first here, isn't it?

395
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,457
l was telling that.

396
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,759
A marriage with other people's money
and a first night.

397
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,801
Now if we could get one honeymoon
aIso l'll be happy.

398
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,596
Then we will start our life.

399
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,671
what happened?

400
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,538
Tensed thinking what we will do
when it dawns tomorrow?

401
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,940
l have brought all my certificates.

402
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,806
lf only l get a small job,
then l can stay at the hostel, isn't it?

403
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,283
No use of hiding fearing the problems.
l will aIso try.

404
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,183
lf l get some job..

405
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,353
May l come in?

406
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,795
Has your first night begun?
- Not yet. what?

407
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,763
l am fortunate. Your first night
may become my last night.

408
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,402
That is what l am afraid of.
- what is it? Any problem?

409
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,265
Everything is gone from my hands.

410
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,840
You both will have to leave right now.
He and his jasmine flowers.

411
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,034
l will lose my job.

412
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,414
why did you ask me to
come with the camera?

413
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,584
Heroine selection.
- At midnight?

414
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,276
Or eIse the sky will fall.
Simply troubling people.

415
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,183
A heroine at midnight?

416
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,255
Heroine?
- Yes.

417
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,051
who? Her?

418
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,198
what a joke! l am a heroine
in the films?

419
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,033
True, if she starts acting
you will get beaten up.

420
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,904
Just stop it. You ground chillies on my
chest and you both keep laughing?

421
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,579
This is a matter in which
l will lose my job.

422
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,739
Then why did you go and tell such things?
- Then what eIse should l say?

423
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:17,012
Should l say l stabbed myself
for a friend of mine? Tell me.

424
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,754
You are my dear sister, aren't you?

425
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,756
Just come there and say anything what
you want in reply to what he asks.

426
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,759
Just don't say you didn't
come here to act.

427
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:31,300
Hey, l can't do that.
- Can't do? Just tell her, man.

428
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,093
She should agree..

429
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,439
He helped us so much and if he loses his job
because of us means it is not good, is it?

430
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,199
l am a poor man too.

431
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,776
Hey, why are you afraid?
we both will face it together.

432
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,744
we? Then what will l say who you are?

433
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,577
Husband.
- Yes, husband.

434
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,653
lf they come to know that the one who
l brought to act as a heroine is married..

435
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,119
they all will surround me and beat me.

436
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,122
Hey, without Balu l won't go anywhere.

437
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,887
My dear sister, l am there with you.

438
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,962
Isn't that enough, man?
- That is enough then..

439
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,061
Hey, this acting etc.
what they say is not such a big thing.

440
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,237
You've learned Bharatanatyam
for five-six years, isn't it?

441
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:08,998
Balu, but..

442
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,072
Just think if you don't succeed,
forget it. Just do it.

443
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,744
At the most even if they say no,
we can stay here for the night, isn't it?

444
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,004
Haven't you seen this, Manichithra Thazh?

445
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,613
Shobana's Nagavalli.

446
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,076
l won't leave you.
- Balu

447
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,085
You villainous dog, it is Durgashtami.

448
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,155
l will kill you..

449
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,990
How is my acting, man?

450
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,220
She can show something like
this, can't she?

451
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,958
You and your acting. My dear sisterjust
don't do anything as he did now.

452
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:43,437
The director keeps saying acting is not needed
only behaving is enough etc. 40 times an hour.

453
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,773
who is it? The producer.

454
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,444
Yes, sir.

455
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,509
He asked us to come there.
- My God!

456
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,117
This won't work.
You manage it somehow.

457
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,688
Surya, get ready.
we will leave right now.

458
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,957
You are going to be on the road, aren't you?

459
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,891
l will aIso come for company.

460
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,359
My job is aIso gone, isn't it?

461
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,533
Come.
- Balu.

462
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,199
Doesn't matter, what if l try it?

463
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,878
A divine woman who has come
to keep us awake at midnight.

464
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,847
Is she a winner at a reality show?

465
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,953
Now she will come, ask her personally.

466
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,491
when we go there,
the director will sitting like this.

467
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,217
He will look at you from top to bottom.

468
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,159
what is your name?

469
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,491
Then tell your name.

470
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,901
Do you know how to act?
lt will be a threatening style.

471
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,571
Don't be afraid.
- lf he threatens l will be afraid.

472
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,639
why should you be afraid?
lf he threatens just tell him to get lost.

473
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:54,141
Let us see what to do later.
- My brother-in-law, don't let me be killed.

474
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,175
Come.

475
00:31:55,647 --> 00:32:04,112
Central

476
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,052
Come.

477
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,032
what is your name?
- Surya

478
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,832
what?
- Surya

479
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,510
Do you know how to act?
- No.

480
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,703
Then?
- My throat is itching.

481
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,939
No, does one need acting in cinema?

482
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,583
lf you only behave, won't it do?

483
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,852
Excellent!

484
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,583
Are you confident that you can act?

485
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,351
Sir, she has learned Bharatnatyam
for six years.

486
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,185
But she has forgotten all the steps.

487
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:48,092
l told her that in your films
you will show her how to act.

488
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,002
whatever you heard is all correct.
But aIso it is wrong.

489
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:56,196
whoever it is who acts without
learning about my character

490
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,534
or the story situation whether it is
a superstar or a super heroine.

491
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,005
l will show them.

492
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,204
whatever sir acts and shows, even if you
do 1/10 of it, then it will be correct.

493
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,119
So you are saying
what l do is overacting?

494
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,982
That l think you know it
without me saying it, isn't it?

495
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,952
Just be quiet, man.

496
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,019
why did you laugh?

497
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,887
Laughing and crying do it in
front of the camera.

498
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,893
That too when l tell you.
Understood?

499
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,256
Then this is some game or something.

500
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,301
This is a thing where millions are invested
and many people have toiled too.

501
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,502
Only having ability and beauty is not
enough you need confidence aIso.

502
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,800
Do you have that?

503
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,700
Just open your mouth
and tell me, girl.

504
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,472
Just don't trouble all of us
at all after starting everything.

505
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:46,655
Sorry, sir, l can't do it. when insisted l came
as l had no alternative. Sorry, sir.

506
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,751
Just play this.

507
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:57,161
Sorry, sir, l can't do it. when insisted l came
as l had no alternative. Sorry, sir.

508
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,998
wonderful. Perfect entry.
This is what..

509
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,503
This is what l wanted.

510
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,341
Did you teach her the dialogue
in this time? Smart fellow.

511
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,406
Yes, but l could not teach her fully.

512
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,913
Surya, you are my heroine.
l am happy.

513
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,353
This is auspicious,
give her the advance.- Okay.

514
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,017
You should come for two days to the
set to see the shooting and learn.

515
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,692
Okay? Good night.

516
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,959
Oh lord, your games can't
be understood.- Kichhu..

517
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,366
Here. There is fifty thousand in this.

518
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,093
Advance.

519
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,293
Hey, l don't want it.

520
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,034
Madam, please.

521
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,437
Just consider this as a token advice what
you need l will get it for you. Please.

522
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,202
Hey, Kichhu!
- Just listen to what l say.

523
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,243
You will take it from and
give her what she asks?

524
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,144
who am l, your father?
Isn't she a new face, stupid?

525
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,978
Maximum remuneration
100000 rupees.

526
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,385
That won't do, sir.
Then leave this case.

527
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,991
without giving minimum 500000
you won't get this girl.

528
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,661
Now where to?

529
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,366
where to?

530
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,505
lf we stop this auto right now,
how much will l have to pay?

531
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:12,574
Rs. 20.
- Then stop it. Here take it.

532
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,676
Thus the last Rs. 20 which
l had is aIso finished.

533
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,210
lf it was some otherjob,
l would have tried.

534
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,515
But this one, me who hasn't
even climbed on a stage.

535
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,124
what does Balu think?
will l be able to do it?

536
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,157
Forget it.

537
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,558
lf you try it and if it doesn't work out then
that will be a bigger mess than this.

538
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,254
And we will be in soup.

539
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,362
Then what is the way out?
The sun will come up anytime now.

540
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,835
Now all we have is this cell phone.

541
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,941
lf l sell this one or two days
can be pulled on.

542
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,574
which is the make?
- what?

543
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,407
what make is it? NOKlA or..
- No, Hitachi.

544
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,675
Hitachi?
- You go, you..

545
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:54,715
Hey, Balu

546
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,047
we are not that bad to sell
the cell phone to a beggar.

547
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,282
Stop. Stop.

548
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,658
Here, Rs.100000 cash.

549
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,992
when l said the money is less and the girl
left the producer is not leaving.

550
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,728
At last l said he should give
Rs.500000 remuneration.

551
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,803
He even agreed for that.

552
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,540
what should l do now?

553
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,872
Balu,

554
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,479
l won't insist anything that
you don't want to do.

555
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,578
l don't know if it will be okay.

556
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,980
Anyway, let me try and see.

557
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:42,389
Central

558
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,065
Come.

559
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,737
Joseph, don't show all your antiques that you
showed to the heroine that we sent away.

560
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,343
There is a fellow with her,
he will punch you.

561
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,740
lf the outfit should be good,
then you must measure properly.

562
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,176
That is a part of my profession.

563
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,782
l told you that you shouldn't
get beaten for no reason.

564
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,513
Costumers, to take measurement.

565
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,819
what is this, shirt?
- Hey, that is my shirt.

566
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,019
Get the bag. Fast.

567
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,428
what is all this?
Is it an exhibition?

568
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,193
Madam, come here and stand.

569
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,462
Remove that shawl.

570
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,799
Now you can take measurement
without removing the shawl.

571
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,375
Then you do it.

572
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,879
Hey, Joseph, you do yourjob. Please.

573
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,978
Isn't there any woman to do all this?

574
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,012
There is one Kunjamma,
in my relation shall l get her?

575
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:41,825
My God.

576
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,194
what is this, Gyanakendra?

577
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,885
Your mother-in-law's.

578
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,020
Next..

579
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,298
30-30. You had seen once, isn't it?

580
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,370
30. Madam, this is a little more.

581
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,906
we should reduce this.

582
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,477
Madam, raise your hands.

583
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,741
This pig is doing a little too much.

584
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:10,678
Spread.
- That is 32. 32.

585
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,424
Hey, didn't l tell you it is 32?
- Balu.

586
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,923
Oh! Didn't l tell you before
you will get punched?

587
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,188
where did this come from?

588
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,899
when you banged on that wall.
- Just leave it.

589
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,533
Kichhu, l just touched him.

590
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,203
Didn't you see his legs shaking?
Early in the morning he is drunk.

591
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,997
Drunk, your father

592
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,197
lt is 16 years since l began this work.

593
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,104
Till no one did something like this to me.

594
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,280
l will show you, man.
You may be the boss of any place.

595
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
l will show what l can do to you.
Come.

596
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,376
Joseph, let me say..

597
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,347
what you want to say,
tell the director.

598
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,784
l want to know whether the costumer or
the bodyguard has more value on the sets.

599
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,389
Let him decide that.

600
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,320
Hey, let us.

601
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,358
Hey, kill me, man.

602
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:55,464
Villain, ruffian, when things come
around you spoilt everything.

603
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,601
l will..
He will just now call the director.

604
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,930
This fellow is the head of the Union.

605
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,230
Let him be any head or anything.

606
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,634
lf the director asks l will tell him..

607
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,741
He behaved without
any respect with my wife.

608
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,968
wife? Then if he asks who you are,
then what shall l say?

609
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,238
Husband.
- Husband.

610
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,847
Oh, so that is the problem now, isn't it?

611
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,244
Not only now, but it is
a problem at all times.

612
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,249
That is no one should know that
l am her husband that is all, right?

613
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:16,977
Yes.

614
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,248
Uncle's son, father's brother's son, like that
many other relations are there, right?

615
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,354
Then confirm any one of those.

616
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,323
Hello, when to come?

617
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,925
Uncle's son, that is enough.

618
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,259
when that is so, then when l give a couple
to such guys, then there is no problem.

619
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,561
A snap is to be taken to
give to the magazine.

620
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,260
They have come, get ready quickly.

621
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,100
Hey, magazine means will the
snap come immediately?

622
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,935
lt will come on the front page.

623
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,304
Oh God, seeing that immediately father
and uncle will come enquiring.

624
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,208
Then the work is over.
- why?

625
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,975
which uncle's son
whom they don't know.

626
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,516
Oh, as you said you are
the uncle's son now, isn't it?

627
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,256
The director is calling to get me.

628
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,681
Hello.

629
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,859
Okay, sir.

630
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,960
Yes.

631
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,225
Okay, sir.

632
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,159
Madam, before going to the scene
do you need to touch up?

633
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,975
Trolley forward.

634
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,537
Okay, good.

635
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,873
we will go for a scene.

636
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,259
Sir, he is the man who is coming.

637
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,833
Make-up man? l see.

638
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,339
Make-up man? Such a big ego?

639
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:52,278
Now don't mess up further.

640
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,541
Understood.

641
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,343
Stop. who is he?

642
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,145
Is he a touch up man or
a bodyguard for her?

643
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,379
He is a touch man, sir.
Didn't you see, bag, comb umbrella.

644
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,354
Got him after a lot of trouble.
- For what? To trouble me?

645
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,619
Here, touch up should
only do touch up.

646
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,490
Don't try to teach others
their work in this set.

647
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,463
Seeing his anger and his pride l thought he
is someone from her home or something.

648
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,361
Did you see, before reaching the sets
the home people start their messing up.

649
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,597
ldiot.

650
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,373
Even before starting to act fanfare
and troubling is their main interest.

651
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,045
No, sir, actually
- what?

652
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,305
what happened was..
- Balu..

653
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,711
Madam.

654
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,209
Really what happened was..
- what?

655
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,019
Sir, in front of so many people,
how to tell you?

656
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,716
That fellow is no good, sir.

657
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,189
Sir, l didn't do anything
as you think, sir.

658
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,559
You don't plead now. Your behaviour
wasn't good even before.

659
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,394
Now aIso.

660
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,070
what you got was good. Go.

661
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,803
Now if l come to know you have
raised on anyone..

662
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,334
Surya, come.

663
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,408
Don't wait to raise anything.

664
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,137
Before the film is over
l will get rid of yourjob.

665
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,838
Then not only on your nose,
l will puncture the place..

666
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,142
from where you piddle and you
will have to put cotton there too.

667
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,253
George, are all the reports
for the magazines, ready?

668
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,050
Yes, everything is ready. Now only
putting the name of the heroine is left.

669
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,123
The name is Surya.

670
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,191
There is already one actor by
that name. we don't want that?

671
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,556
which is your place?
- Andikkadu.

672
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,732
Then isn't Surya Andikkadu is not okay?

673
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,662
Adding the place's name
with the heroine's name?

674
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,199
From where has he come?
- Isn't there any?

675
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,394
There is, sir. Adoor Bhavani,
Kaviyur Ponnamma

676
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,937
lndu Vazhapuzha, Bina Kumbalangya.

677
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,769
Those are character artists.
This is a heroine, isn't she?

678
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,844
One minute.
what if we name her Amedya?

679
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,139
You give that name to your grandma.

680
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,976
George, write the name, Anamika.

681
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,845
what? Herding elephants?

682
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:40,513
Hey, Anamika, the one with no name.

683
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,560
Naming is over. Now when will the
feeding ceremony take place?

684
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,696
Very soon it will take place.

685
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:49,697
Did you see that?

686
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:54,030
That is touch up. Just see that and
try to understand how that is done.

687
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,967
Now there is no use of
just seeing, is there?

688
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,868
Shouldn't l learn its basics?

689
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,903
There is a way for that.
For that we have brother Lawrence.

690
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:14,252
Hey, if you say make-up did you think
it is some easy thing? lt is a big ocean.

691
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,858
lt can't be learned in five days.

692
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,053
Hey, you, if you try
you won't be able to do it.

693
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,559
Now if brother Lawrence thinks
it can be done.

694
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,564
That is why l openly told you everything.

695
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,169
lt is not to put make-up to
Kamala Hasan in Dasavataram.

696
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,464
lt is touching up for his own wife.

697
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,439
My Kichhu, what will l get from that?

698
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:38,439
Just getting me in trouble.
You don't play with me.

699
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,881
whichever wig brother places
on his head it matches well.

700
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,576
Hey, Subichhu..

701
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,649
My dear Lawrence,
please somehow teach him.

702
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,620
lf you want l will make him
hold your legs.

703
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,590
Hey, no need to hold my legs.
Isn't that bad?

704
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,787
Now do you want to learn
how to do make-up?

705
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,489
l wish to learn.

706
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,859
Then learn by putting make-up on my leg.

707
00:43:59,069 --> 00:43:59,865
On the leg?

708
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,039
No, l will give the face of Aiswarya Rai
to put make-up and learn.

709
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,832
Hey, put make-up on my leg, man.

710
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,843
Do you want pan stick or pancake?

711
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,512
l don't want any of those things.
Here take this.

712
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:13,945
This is one type of oil,
you apply this and do the make-up.

713
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,146
This will take time, l will come now.

714
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,981
Put on the make-up.
- Yes.

715
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,625
when l make my Balagopalan
massage with oil..

716
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,755
Your work is not only as a make-up man.

717
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,760
l will make you a masseur too.
- Masseur?

718
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,398
Yes, the one who massages the body.

719
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,468
Massage me well. Hey, don't go up
there it will get damaged.

720
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,497
Hey, Balu, now l am really afraid.

721
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,303
Now how shall l stay alone
in this room?

722
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,808
Hey, don't make me too afraid
by telling this often.

723
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:42,808
Just remember one thing.

724
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,981
Till daylight don't open the door
to anyone if they knock.

725
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,084
Even then if you are still afraid
you call me. My lodge is not that far.

726
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,221
why are you dying waking
at this hour?

727
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,859
Is there anyone to call you
at this hour?

728
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,823
what did you think of the
cinema people?

729
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,689
Brother please, oh!

730
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,957
For things to move smoothly
l have only this way.

731
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,192
Touch up on the face of the heroine.
Then what to do?

732
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,300
You lie down and go to sleep.

733
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,837
why don't you sing a song too?
And now l want to sleep.

734
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:15,774
lf you intend to keep talking till
dawn l will throw you out.

735
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,743
How is your room?
Do you have a/c?

736
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,949
why do you need a/c?
Here there is a good wind blowing.

737
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,951
Yes, of course, they have got
lot of air held in here.

738
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,022
Do you have somnambulism?
- what is that?

739
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,456
walking in sleep?
- l don't have any such habit.

740
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,687
But l have that habit.

741
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,860
l asked since l may dash
on you in sleep.

742
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:44,172
Can't even talk properly.
Balu, how long will this continue?

743
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:48,105
don't worry, dear. lf you don't
get sleep you take that scene,

744
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,873
look at yourself in the mirror say
that dialogue 3-4 times and practice.

745
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,141
You have shooting in the morning, isn't it?

746
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,115
And then, the money we receive
has all evaporated.

747
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,049
Okay, then, good night.
- Good night.

748
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:11,958
Central

749
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,333
Did you see? How is my idea?

750
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:24,105
Lighting that mosquito coil was not only for
mosquito but aIso to stop me in the night.

751
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,646
Dear sir, will you take your vehicle
into the shed and park?

752
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,681
l want to lie down and sleep.
- Okay.

753
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,018
Now l want to begin working auspiciously.

754
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,418
God, see that my hand doesn't shiver.

755
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,760
Softly. Softly.

756
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:46,159
ln this make-up work, what the hand
does the body shouldn't know.

757
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,430
And aIso, the hand shouldn't do the
work that the body doesn't know.

758
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,567
l will give you one blow.
what are you doing on the face?

759
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,176
Don't press so hard, do it softly.

760
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,573
Have you read all the dialogues?
Is it all okay? The director is fully agitated.

761
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,273
He is shouting at everyone.

762
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,578
Hey, Balu, tell this buffoon
not to scare me.

763
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,186
Just go from here.

764
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,252
And then..

765
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,287
And then..

766
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,026
Fill the jaw.
- Going to do Kathakali?

767
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,524
Do it properly, man.

768
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,161
This Anamika's stilIs have come out well.

769
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,160
And l am really impressed.

770
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,833
Now if my guess comes true,
may be she may surprise us.

771
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,493
Hey, if you don't get too surprised and say
pack up and go that is enough for me.

772
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,368
Shut up, l don't want to listen.
As far as..

773
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,043
Say the dialogue doing some modulation.

774
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,677
Shut up, l don't want to listen.

775
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,904
Hey, don't teach wrong things to her.

776
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:35,608
Dear, pay attention to me.
Shut up, l don't want to listen.

777
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,377
l will beat him and..

778
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,318
Surya, here.

779
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:46,118
This first nervousness and tension
is there in all actors' lives.

780
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,662
Once that is all done away with,
then it is okay.

781
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,093
Then the rest of the people
will get tensed.

782
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:55,567
Dear, you get good takes ten times then
all your tension will just fly away.

783
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,706
Anamika, shot ready.

784
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,571
Okay. Ready. Ready.
Ready. Ready.

785
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,781
Field clear.

786
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,916
Field clear.

787
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,247
The wig looks good.

788
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,924
lt is not a wig, it is original.
Then l will do good make-up.

789
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,183
Hell with him.

790
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,254
How is it?

791
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,190
Hey, man, what is going on?

All the best, okay?

795
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,271
Go that side.

796
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,271
Hey, sir, l am here.
wherever l go there is something there.

797
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,207
Okay. Silence, silence, let us see now.

798
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,210
Hey, don't. Don't.

799
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,281
what is it?
- Umbrella, sir.

800
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,542
Take it and go from here.

801
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,278
Hey, l am gone. Oh!

802
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,228
Ready, action.

00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,139
why are you shouting, that child
will get frightened, isn't it?

807
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,578
Surya, Anamika,

808
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,115
when you say shut up even without
himself knowing he should shut up.

809
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,979
You need that much energy.
Say that vibrantly.

810
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,580
we will do a take and see.

811
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,153

l agree that you are a master.

815
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,823
And l have given the
respect for that too.

816
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,626
lf you further interfere, then l will
say l don't want this show and quit.

817
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:32,460
Cut. Cut.

818
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:33,658
Excellent.

819
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:58,184
Central

820
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:10,535
who will give?
Now who will give a nest for a night?

821
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:16,771
who will give? Now who will give us,
a house with a good door and walIs?

822
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:22,577
ln the nest and in the dream house
when will we unite together?

823
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:29,350
when will we live happily
and sing over there?

824
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:40,565

Now who will give a nest for a night?

825
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:49,873
who will give? Now who will give us,
a house with a good door and walIs?

826
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:13,259
Central

827
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:26,178
Now we start our life.

828
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:32,288
The silence that is waiting
to break out in both us.

829
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:43,229
The various love songs that is waiting to be
sung in the accompaniment of golden lyre.

830
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:49,235
and string a sweet tune in that stringing
that lyre and sing a beautiful tune.

831
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:55,275
stringing that lyre and sing a beautiful tune
the love comes out in that like rain

832
00:51:55,479 --> 00:52:01,782
and it gets soaked.
as it does so in the dessert.

833
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:07,685
who will give? Now who will give,
a nest for a night?

834
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:14,558
who will give? Now who will give us,
a house with a good door and walIs?

835
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:38,344
Central

836
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:56,338
Though l see you, l can't be
with you to heart's content.

837
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:07,474
Though l hear you, l don't hear those love tunes
and the union for which we both long for.

838
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:19,391
to finish with the forced separation the heart
yearns for your company in this climate.

839
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:25,865
That come up and this disappears
will this dream come again?

840
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:31,837
who will give?
Now who will give a nest for a night?

841
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:37,981
who will give? Now who will give us,
a house with a good door and walIs?

842
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:43,778
ln the nest and in the dream house
when will we unite together?

843
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:50,392
when will we live happily
and sing over there?

844
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:51,955
Okay

845
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:58,560
Get that brush.

846
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,631
Blacken my beard.

847
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,266
where is Surya?
- She is inside, sir.

848
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:07,408
Okay

849
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,538
You were sitting here?

850
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,579
Got bored sitting alone?
- No.

851
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,683
lt will take a little more time for set up.

852
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,953
l have here, good romantic songs.

853
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,588
Listen to it when you get bored.

854
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,595
ln cinema there are good people like
me and aIso there are bad people.

855
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,091
There are a couple of good songs.

856
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:35,068
''Oh clouds shower flowers,
my beloved has come.''

857
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:39,402
''Oh clouds shower flowers,
my beloved has come.''

858
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,873
lt is a height in romance, isn't it?

859
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,512
He is not like that with everyone.

860
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,182
This is the first time he gave
a gift to a person.

861
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,648
Be careful.
He is not a good person.

862
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,619
Yes. Yes.
Then it will be his last half movie.

863
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,287
Ugh, oh.

864
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,864
Hey, what is this for?
- Father.

865
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:11,802
This is wig for father.
- Not that. That is her father.

866
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,000
Now, where is Surya?
- who?

867
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,406
Surya. The heroine in this cinema.

868
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,309
Her new name is, Anamika.

869
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,184
who are you?
- l am her father.

870
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,580
Father?
- Can't you believe?

871
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,016
Suddenly, l am believing.

872
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,689
For now madam..please, sit here.

873
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,256
You people are in shoot now.

874
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,325
You sit here, l..
Madam is in shoot now, here..

875
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,891
Believe what l am saying. Madam is ..

876
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,130
Hey sit down, listen to me first.

877
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,171
Sir.. this is my father.

878
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,611
Greetings, sir.

879
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:54,942
On the day of marriage you disappear
from home without any one knowing.

880
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,279
l am being made fun of saying the daughter
eloped and got married to someone.

881
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:05,861
Now will the people and family believe when
l say that she ran away to act in the films?

882
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,267
Father, this is the director.

883
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,699
what is this, sir?
Don't you have girl children in your house?

884
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,129
when a girl comes alone don't you
ask if there is anyone with her

885
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,399
has her family agreed
to her acting in films etc?

886
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:22,908
what is this Uncle?
Isn't this her wish? Let it go.

887
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,637
No, sir. l am upset.

888
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,816
Till today she hasn't told me
about this passion of hers.

889
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:30,383
l am saying this as a flattery.
Surya is a very talented girl.

890
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,817
Let it be so. l am not opposing it.

891
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,650
Hello, sir.. l am Deepak.
- Hi Deepak.

892
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,349
He is the one who is going
to marry my daughter.

893
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,390
l see.

894
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,326
Surya, first of all l am sorry.

895
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:46,298
Missing a day before marriage.
Some scandal about some prior relationship.

896
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,471
Quiet natural. A misunderstanding.

897
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:52,038
For that accept my unconditional apology.
Okay?

898
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,836
Now l am happy.
As l am going to marry a celebrity.

899
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,402
Stupid.

900
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,340
Ali..
- Sir..

901
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,978
Sir, l saw your film
'Pariyam Maranda Katha.' five times.

902
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,712
what is so great about that film
that you saw it five times?

903
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,613
Hey since sunrise you
started setting up lights.

904
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:09,849
Isn't it over till now?
- lt is ready, sir.

905
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,186
Then shouldn't you tell me?
Come, Surya.

906
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,524
Dad, have a seat.

907
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:24,830
Lawrence, see that those two
don't move from this place.

908
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,542
The director has a good sense of humour.

909
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:37,647
Central

910
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,215
l will get down and search for him.
when l see him l will whistle like this.

911
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,159
lmmediately you must come inside.
- Okay.

912
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,261
ln the next cinema l will give
you a good role.

913
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:52,299
Since you don't have much talent..

914
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,268
Have all these women come
to act in the films?

915
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,533
lf so?- How much would be
needed to make a film?

916
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,372
lf you are going to make a film then
money won't come it will only go.

917
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,705
Can't remember you, who are you?

918
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,746
l came searching for a man.
- whom?

919
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,483
This man.

920
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,812
who is this?
- My brother-in-law.

921
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,750
Oh, Vasu Mama.
- Not uncle Vasu. But uncle wareed.

922
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,517
Money lender.. Uncle wareed.

923
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:19,524
The one who l say is not the one
whom you are saying, okay?

924
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:23,256
Got saved. Is he following me?
Let me stand.

925
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,097
lt is enough that l see the man
you know, my son.

926
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:29,567
lf you point him out to me l will get him
out without anybody's knowledge.

927
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:32,764
Or eIse, l will make a big commotion
here and flush him out

928
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,807
and then l will get him with celebration.

929
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:36,603
Hey. Foolishness.
- what?

930
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,407
My dear wareed, don't show foolishness.

931
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,847
Principle and interest with
no reduction, leave that..

932
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,612
l guarantee that the whole amount
you will get in that bag.

933
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,949
How come you give that guarantee?

934
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,224
Here this girl is the guarantee.

935
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,825
The heroine in this cinema.

936
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,019
lt is Balu who owes me.

937
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,424
Now who is this one of his?

938
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,623
This is the girl who Balu is marrying.

939
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,701
This girl charges Rs. 1 .2 million
for one movie.

940
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,565
wareed's loan is just 600000.

941
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,171
when the movies is over
your loan aIso will be over.

942
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,170
Not enough?
- Is it true?

943
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,137
Then..

944
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,640
Hey wait. You are his friend, isn't it?

945
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,312
lt is not enough if you or he says.

946
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,638
This girl should tell me.

947
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,374
l will make her say.

948
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:19,617
Balu, l will manage this.
lf dad comes here..

949
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,620
Don't be afraid. Lawrence will see
that they don't come here.

950
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:25,988
Did you see him making her up?
They are so much in love.

951
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,562
Did you see, there below...there like that.

952
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,332
They are very much in love, isn't it?

953
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,931
Okay sir, ready. Take one.

954
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,401
Okay, get the umbrella out.

955
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,074
Jacob..
- Yes, ready..

956
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,576
Start camera.. action.

957
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,678
what l thought is not like
what you are thinking.

958
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,679
Now to make you understand
explaining it to you is difficult for me.

959
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,109
You must understand
my mental condition..

960
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,516
Hey go.. who are you?
- what minds you who l am?

961
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,249
For so long time you are wearing
a hat and are watching the shoot.

962
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,756
where are those security guards?
Get these useless people away from here.

963
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,292
why are you sending me out?

964
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,895
wareed, this is the director.
- Shouldn't he say who he is?

965
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,156
who is he?

966
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,355
He is producer's brother-in-law.

967
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,865
l thought so. Otherwise no one would
show so much stupidity.

968
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,059
Leave my hand. Leave my hand.

969
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,603
Please, clear this place and
go sit somewhere eIse.

970
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,275
As soon as this shot is over
l will get her immediately.

971
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,034
l will come.

972
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,278
A strong set up he has.

973
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,051
Hey. who?

974
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,150
who are you?
- Brother-in-law.

975
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:27,982
which brother-in-law?

976
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,852
l am the brother of the
producer of this film.

977
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,321
Go and prepare a tea for me.

978
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,052
That is great. without my knowledge
l have a brother-in-law?

979
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:38,393
Hey, did you marry my sister
or did l marry your sister?

980
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,569
Oh my God.

981
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,398
Sir, move this side.

982
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:46,666
Now who is my brother-in-law in this film?
Producer or director?

983
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:51,074
when your brother-in-law is such a big director
don't you know a single thing about cinema?

984
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,373
He is the brother-in-law of the director.
- Then who is he?

985
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,413
He is the producer.

986
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,084
He is his brother-in-law, isn't it?
- Yes.

987
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,413
Not simply.. the moment l saw his
ego and stupidity l thought so.

988
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:02,591
Stupid..
- Hey, come here. Come here.

989
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,931
whatever he said is true.

990
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,103
As soon as the shooting is over
immediately l will send the money.

991
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,362
Till then, don't trouble Balu.

992
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:17,504
Did you hear that?

993
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,538
Yes, l heard.
You will marry her, isn't it?

994
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:20,470
l will marry her.

995
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,939
l will give the money.
- what?

996
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,908
Even if you won't marry him
will you give my money?

997
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:24,704
She will give. She will give.

998
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:26,142
Then, let us go.

999
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,783
Then let us go l said.
Come.

1000
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,149
He is a man who women are crazy about.

1001
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,821
Go girIs, go.

1002
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,614
l want to make a film right now.

1003
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,452
lf you give some money and help me
l will make a movie for brother.

1004
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,992
Friend only money isn't enough,
you need brains too.

1005
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,859
l can only ask what you have, brother.
- Mmmm. Hugh?

1006
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,828
Shall we go, then?
Hey, come on.

1007
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,937
Shall l ask you something?
This Kunjakka.. how is he?

1008
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,403
He is not some digger, isn't it?
- what is this, Balu?

1009
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:57,102
l should know, isn't it? Oh, ho.
there he comes, Your father.

1010
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:00,808
Send them back soon.

1011
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:04,549
Dear, we are going now.

1012
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,312
You are not angry or troubled, isn't it?

1013
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,383
Now you should call everyday.
Not only me but him too.

1014
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,493
l will come in between and enquire.

1015
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,163
Doesn't she need a woman
as a company with her?

1016
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:18,094
l have an aunt in my relation.
l will send her here.

1017
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:19,495
Just for a help.

1018
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,397
Then, l am going dear.

1019
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,736
Okay.. see you soon.

1020
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,747
No one understands the
pain of my heart.

1021
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:36,646
Anyone can say anything and do.
But my love..

1022
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,754
Oh, what a stupid dialogue this is?

1023
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,584
Now when you say such dialogue
do you know what will happen in the theatre?

1024
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,283
There are some people who have come
only to shout in the theatre.

1025
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,725
lf they get this in their hands they will
shout and get your film down.

1026
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,023
Let anyone shout or break
or do anything.

1027
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,463
Somehow, l want to finish this
and escape from this.

1028
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:55,933
But l have a strong doubt that
before it finishes it will be a mess.

1029
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,733
Your father had a brought a man here.

1030
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,375
Some talks about some prior alliance.

1031
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,841
A misunderstanding.
lt is quite natural, pal.

1032
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:07,573
Demonic guy. He and his chain, bangle,
and earring and nose stud.

1033
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,876
l felt like punching him.

1034
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,645
Anyway he has to beg.
Let that be there.

1035
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,719
l am afraid of the other one.
- who?

1036
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,550
The demon with the cap, that director.

1037
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,124
His colouring his moustache,
making you hear songs..

1038
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:22,161
l will one day hold him against the wall by
his neck and give one slap on his cheek..

1039
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:26,233
he will start trembling like this
and say kaa..

1040
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,062
Hey, who must be that?

1041
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,933
Is it the director?
l will hide in the bathroom.

1042
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,631
Don't these cinema people
sleep in the night?

1043
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,235
The director is calling.

1044
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,477
where are you going at this hour?
lt is 8 o'clock now.

1045
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,720
l swear by my father.

1046
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,823
lf this goes on like this l will kill,
Balu and l will aIso die.

1047
01:03:57,633 --> 01:04:00,397
l am not a Shakespeare
to create new sentences.

1048
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:05,973
l don't know any line or sentence to convey
feelings of love to the woman whom l love.

1049
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:10,009
whatever l want to say
shall l it with a kiss?

1050
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,338
Now l will make you..

1051
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,709
Shall l consider your silence
as your agreement?

1052
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:14,814
what is it, pal?

1053
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,781
Do you.. Do you need some
juice or buttermilk?

1054
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,114
For me?
- For madam..

1055
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,622
Do you walk behind madam,
with juice and buttermilk?

1056
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,019
Just close the door and get out.

1057
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,991
Comes to serve buttermilk.

1058
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,959
Balu, just go now.

1059
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,793
we had come in a good mood
and he messed it all.

1060
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,628
lt was a dialogue?

1061
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,262
Hey, Hey, what is it?

1062
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,735
Now Surya has gone inside.

1063
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:42,342
Surya? From where did you
learn all this respect?

1064
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,639
You must say Surya madam,
or Surya Amma.

1065
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,706
lnstead of loitering here,
go to your lodge.

1066
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,186
Yes.
- Shall l come there?

1067
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,158
lf your are drunk don't come.
Or eIse come in.

1068
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:09,570
Oh, he and his scene discussion,
dialogues and acting and showing,

1069
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,399
l am not able to bear it anymore.
There is a limit to it.

1070
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:17,344
Balu, just say one word.
l will finish everything in just a minute.

1071
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,044
As if all this wasn't enough now he wants
me to go out for dinner with him.

1072
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,978
Let him take his wife.

1073
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:25,585
Did you see, that producer came
in with this cheque.

1074
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,983
why are you afraid?
- Afraid? what for?

1075
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,021
To go out for dinner?
- Not afraid.

1076
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,023
l can't go with that crazy guy.

1077
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,929
Dear, the dinner is at
the restaurant, isn't it?

1078
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,223
Only you two aren't there, isn't it?

1079
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,990
There are many others too, right?

1080
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,499
Now you know yourself,
even l know you.

1081
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,696
More than this what guarantee
do we both need?

1082
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,207
Ha.. Surya

1083
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,983
why are you here at this hour?
- That..

1084
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,211
l don't want your overseeing
and guarding in the room.

1085
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:03,449
At the time to read some dialogues and
practice he comes to disturb, nuisance

1086
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,388
Just go to your room
without turning back.

1087
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,661
Now here.. are you going there?
- To get my bag.

1088
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,390
To get the bag.

1089
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,660
Surya, you must keep the people
at their right place.

1090
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,394
These guys will act meekly now.

1091
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:19,631
lf you are lenient towards him
he will take advantage of it.

1092
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:29,841
Central

1093
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:33,419
But what shocked me is your
passion with your acting.

1094
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:37,649
The day before your marriage you leave
everything and runaway to act in cinemas.

1095
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,722
l can't remain without
appreciating that determination.

1096
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:41,988
Thank you, sir.

1097
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,390
This..

1098
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:47,769
Excuse me..

1099
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,230
Don't serve here, serve it there..
on that table.

1100
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:51,303
Okay, sir.

1101
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,899
That boring guy is coming here.
He will come, sit here and ruin our privacy.

1102
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,671
we will sit there.
Only we both are here.

1103
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,115
Sit.

1104
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,849
l don't see anything wrong
in what Surya, did.

1105
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,285
Marriage is not the biggest thing in life.

1106
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,460
lf that is so, then l should have
married five or six times.

1107
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,857
Is sir not married?
- Not so far.

1108
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,298
Excuse me.

1109
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,835
Stop your stupid chair play

1110
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:22,965
Give that pen here.

1111
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:26,802
Give it to him.

1112
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:28,971
An autograph.

1113
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,442
Sir.

1114
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,038
Go and sleep.

1115
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:38,175
Have you heard the story of the world
famous actress Julia Roberts.

1116
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:38,853
No.

1117
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:44,152
She came into the films accidentally
without expecting to do so.

1118
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,092
who is Julia Roberts?

1119
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:49,355
She got more that 40 awards
including Oscar,

1120
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,500
and has the most number of fans all
over the world than anyone eIse.

1121
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,503
we don't know what we will be one day.

1122
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,934
lt spreads itself.. open it before us.

1123
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,167
l will tell you one thing, there is an
extraordinary actress inside you.

1124
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,809
l have script with me which
l have kept aside

1125
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:10,509
since l did not get a heroine who can speak
good Malayalam and highly talented.

1126
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,119
My dream project.
Now l can make that film.

1127
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:17,019
You have a role in that which will give you
a chance to get you a national award.

1128
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:17,953
who is the hero, sir?

1129
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,399
Hello. what is it?
Should l come right now?

1130
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,195
what? Any problem?

1131
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,237
Okay. Okay. l am coming.

1132
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,169
Oh it has become a mess, my God.

1133
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,242
That is sure, there's no doubt about it.

1134
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:39,471
lt is a thing that a woman can't hide.

1135
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:41,445
what?
- Pregnancy.

1136
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,618
Or eIse what mess can happen to you?

1137
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:44,843
My dear, Lawrence..

1138
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:49,184
Don't man. The moment l saw
that stupid fellow..

1139
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:53,418
The job is not something
one gets every day.

1140
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,688
Hey brother, this is not the issue.

1141
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,628
l see. Then, what are you good for?

1142
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:01,064
l will come late tonight. See that you
don't latch the door from inside.

1143
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,602
Take some cashewnuts from here.
lt is very good.

1144
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,240
what for?
- For everything.

1145
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,070
Hey, what is this l am doing?

1146
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:29,354
Central

1147
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,394
Do you know who this, Julia Roberts?

1148
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,333
who?
- Julia Roberts.

1149
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,407
Ah yes, wasn't she the aunt
who went somewhere eIse?

1150
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:44,443
You called me at midnight for something
important and talking some old stories?

1151
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:49,175
Balu, shall l take this seriously?

1152
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,478
what?
- Acting.

1153
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,848
what happened? Did that demon hat guy,
brainwashed you?

1154
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:59,460
Not like that. l thought what
he said might be true too.

1155
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,222
lt is Hero Prithviraj in sir's next film.

1156
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:05,025
Do you know who the heroine is?
- who?

1157
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,294
He says, it is me.

1158
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,498
Sir, even told me the story.

1159
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:16,406
Oh, Balu a sweet love story.
And my character is..

1160
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,307
Now what are you showing?

1161
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:23,547
Just break all that and throw it.

1162
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,515
Now l will show you.

1163
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:26,551
Hey, don't run.

1164
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:30,521
Sleeping in that hotel with bed bedbugs...

1165
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,489
Hey don't run.

1166
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,871
which stupid fellow has come
at such late hour?

1167
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,273
Please, Balu.

1168
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:03,522
Didn't you sleep till now?
- No, sir. l have headache.

1169
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:07,753
Yes, you can't sleep.
l too can't get any sleep.

1170
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,431
Let us sit and talk for a while.

1171
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,692
l was just going to lie down
and take some rest.

1172
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:16,701
But it won't get cured.
l will tell you a good remedy.

1173
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:24,744
winter green leaves, basil leaves, herbal leaf
grind all leaves smoothly and apply.

1174
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,881
On the forehead.

1175
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,379
On the forehead.

1176
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,351
Did you say anything?
- No, sir.

1177
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,456
These villainous guys.

1178
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:49,770
Mmm. what is special? Are you okay?

1179
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,203
l am okay. l believe that you too are okay.

1180
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,400
Shall l leave?
- Okay go to sleep.

1181
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:57,312
This man..

1182
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,670
what is it?
- Nothing.

1183
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:00,678
Then go, Okay.

1184
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:03,215
l saw him coming here.
That is why l came.

1185
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:04,977
You don't seem to be well.

1186
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:08,413
l have a headache.
- Is it? Then take rest.

1187
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:10,886
lf you want you take rest
tomorrow till noon.

1188
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:14,324
You can come afternoon. Good night.
- Good night.

1189
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,257
whose shirt is this?
- Balu's.

1190
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,433
How come it is here?

1191
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:21,231
when the buttons broke he removed it.

1192
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:24,668
Buttons broke?
Buttons can't break that way.

1193
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,438
Tell him to come to my room in the morning
take this shirt and then come to the set.

1194
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:29,702
Okay, sir.

1195
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,509
He isn't aware of nature yet.

1196
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:39,915
l will beat him into a pulp.

1197
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,817
Balu. Now don't stay here.
Leave from here.

1198
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:42,786
lt will become a big mess.

1199
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,289
Hey how can l go?
He took my shirt, isn't it?

1200
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,193
No l am asking because l don't know.

1201
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:50,422
Tomorrow if l remove my jeans and
underwear will he take them away too?

1202
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:52,156
Is your director a washer man?

1203
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,300
Here take.
- what is it?

1204
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,799
Adjust with this.

1205
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:57,435
Think that it is a Kurta.

1206
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,470
They will think that l am going
for a tiger hunt.

1207
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:10,242
Hey, stop. Stop.

1208
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,113
who is it at this hour?
which place are you from?

1209
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,983
l am going to grind some
winter green and basil leaves.

1210
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,987
To grind and apply on forehead.

1211
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,820
lt is good. Go and do it.

1212
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,222
Hey stop there.

1213
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,330
Dance master Chandhni.

1214
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:34,572
Yes.

1215
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:38,844
what is it?

1216
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,279
lt seems sir wanted to see me.

1217
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:42,142
who said so?

1218
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:45,787
Now my shirt is in Anamika madam's room..

1219
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:47,421
Oh Anamika madam.

1220
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:50,421
You respect me only in your talks,
but can't find it in action.

1221
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,890
You put your dirty shirt and
underwear in her room..

1222
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,528
who is she? Is she related to you?
- Mmmm.

1223
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:55,355
what?

1224
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:57,589
Oh no, isn't madam my boss, sir?

1225
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,064
Oh then you know the matter.

1226
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,863
You feel that you are
a handsome bloke, isn't it?

1227
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,866
Now that is what you think, right?

1228
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,700
lt is not necessary that others
too should feel so.

1229
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:11,437
Many people who had such notions here
got a lot of other unwanted things.

1230
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,945
when l said others l intended
it to be woman.

1231
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:20,452
lf that is your intention in your play with Surya
l am telling you frankly, l will kill you.

1232
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:21,623
Okay.

1233
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,450
l will tell you what you are thinking.

1234
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,255
You think l am jealous..
or l am in love with her.

1235
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:32,366
l do both. Not with her,
but with her talent.

1236
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:36,060
Anything that disturbs that or anything
that affects her concentration,

1237
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:38,933
whoever it is l won't allow it.
Did you understand?

1238
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,132
Yes.
- Your shirt is lying there.

1239
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,638
who is it? l thought it was Surya.

1240
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,468
Oh.. should l sit here?

1241
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,610
To light a cigarette with lamp?

1242
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:18,442
Then what l don't know.

1243
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:19,677
what?

1244
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:21,575
An ant bit you?

1245
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,379
Oh was it this?
when she showed like this,

1246
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,714
l thought something that is said
from underneath the tongue.

1247
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:28,855
He caught me from behind.

1248
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:31,150
Hey, l don't have anything like that.
l mistook the person.

1249
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,295
Mistook the person?
Then why did you come and spread hands?

1250
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:35,690
Sister, this is my make-up man. Balu.

1251
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,833
Oh, greetings sister.
- Keep the greetings for yourself.

1252
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:42,036
Seeing his embrace it is like
that of Uncle.

1253
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:44,603
what does Uncle do?
- Uncle will do anything, go.

1254
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:46,967
Hey what is this? Come here.

1255
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,444
Balu, this is Deepak's aunt.
- She is a vamp.

1256
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,638
She has sent for some help.
You go.

1257
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:58,218
You send this thing as soon as possible.
Or eIse.. l will kill her in just one kick.

1258
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,717
we will see at the set.

1259
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:05,250
what? The bank agreed?
l am saved, my son.

1260
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,189
Then what? l am coming.

1261
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,523
Brother Lawrence, l won't be here
for a couple of days.

1262
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,858
Please, manage.
- l can't do it.

1263
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,001
He hasn't learned to work,
before that he wants leave.

1264
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:14,896
Hey not that.

1265
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,594
The bank agreed to sell the property
which was caught up in a case.

1266
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:21,469
lf l can sell it quickly l can finish of all my
loans and will have some money in my pocket.

1267
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,271
Hey, did you tell this matter to Surya?

1268
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,468
why do you ask?

1269
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:29,139
lf she comes to know that your problems are
solved she will leave and go right away.

1270
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,343
Don't tell this to her until
this film is made.

1271
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,522
Here comes the new twist.

1272
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,590
Now she is thinking to take up
acting seriously.

1273
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:41,524
She is saying that in her next film Prithviraj
is the hero she is jumping up and down.

1274
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:45,666
Then you will be her
make-up man, isn't it?

1275
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,892
Go and die.

1276
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,469
Hey friend, cinema is
a kind of addiction.

1277
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:55,302
Once you know the taste
then it is difficult to come back.

1278
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,638
Yes, l have seen many of them.

1279
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,019
Here, egg white and plantain
is a very healthy food.

1280
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,381
Uncle used to eat that always.

1281
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:09,250
Come over there after having it.

1282
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,421
Hey, what are you miming over there?
- No, l was asking whether she wants pancake.

1283
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,188
You only have that. His pancake.

1284
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,092
Don'tjust give her anything
and spoil her stomach.

1285
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,097
Now that pancake is not for eating.
- Is it for killing rats?

1286
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,270
No. lt is to apply on the face.

1287
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:23,435
Apply on the face.

1288
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:26,107
First you got in the room and created
chaos and now trying to teach me too?

1289
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,209
Now what do you know about
touch-up and make-up?

1290
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:32,005
without knowing anything you
drag the heroine and walk.

1291
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:35,047
Before one shows the head in a film..
people come saying aunty, this and that.

1292
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,945
You go old woman, you come with me.

1293
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,019
Hey, Amanika..

1294
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,682
The shooting will be over at four today.

1295
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,292
we will go out today.
l have something to tell you today.

1296
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,620
Can't you say that here?

1297
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,626
As l can't tell you here,
l said we will go out.

1298
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,662
l will come at seven, you be ready.

1299
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,836
Hey, that won't do.
lf any one sees us?

1300
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,095
So what if anyone sees us?

1301
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:57,464
So what if anyone sees us?

1302
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,642
Now even if someone does
we will tackle it at that time.

1303
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,777
That won't be right, Balu.
lt is me who has to answer all of them.

1304
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:06,311
Hey, if that is so.. then l too will
have say something.

1305
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,279
Not as the make-up man of the
heroine but as your husband.

1306
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:12,552
Okay, l will come.

1307
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:29,894
Central

1308
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:36,367
Mmm, you didn't need so much glamour.

1309
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:37,636
You are coming with me, right?

1310
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:40,007
Only a Churidar or a sari
would have been enough.

1311
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:43,413
You look beautiful in anything you wear.
Come.

1312
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,349
Hey who is it?
whoever it is tell them to call later.

1313
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:49,751
lt is the director sir.

1314
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:53,490
Sir, l have just come out.
l am coming now.

1315
01:18:57,132 --> 01:19:00,795
Balu, today it is the audio release
of Pritviraj's film.

1316
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,129
He insisted me very much
that l should go with him.

1317
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,703
He is waiting downstairs for me.

1318
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:11,139
Oh, then l don't have to wait. Isn't it?

1319
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,246
we can go there any time, right?

1320
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:19,451
Balu, please there is no other way.
Please, understand.

1321
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,254
when l came back
l will call immediately.

1322
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:43,104
Dear friends, people and fans are waiting
for the release of Prithviraj's film 'Cheers..'

1323
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:46,769
and l warmly welcome
all of you on the occasion.

1324
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:53,911
l request our loved director of Malayalam films
Siddhartha on the stage to receive the CD.

1325
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:05,927
Greeting sir, come.

1326
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,898
Now my script work is almost over.

1327
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,435
You haven't met the heroine, isn't it?
- No.

1328
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,301
Anamika. Please come.

1329
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,472
Meet our, Prithviraj.

1330
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:18,339
Hi.
- Miss Anamika.

1331
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,847
He praises you a lot.
Congrats.

1332
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:29,517
You come with me.
- Now what do l say?

1333
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,284
Leave me.
- Balu, Come with me.

1334
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,758
l said, leave me. ldiot,
see how he looks.

1335
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,124
Leave my hand.

1336
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,961
Isn't he, Balu?
Is he drunk or something?

1337
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,633
Hey Surya, even l am standing
fully mad here.

1338
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,309
ln between, if you hurt me again.

1339
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,673
ln what way did l hurt, Balu?
Because l didn't come with you?

1340
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,347
was it for that you made such a show?

1341
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,949
l didn't do it purposely.
lt happened. You know it.

1342
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:00,610
After coming into this mess how many
times l have faced insult, isn't it?

1343
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:05,691
Balu, all that wasn't only for me, right?
- l haven't said so, right? lt is for both of us.

1344
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:08,089
But.. But.. now even you have

1345
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,663
Tell me what l have done.
- You haven't done anything let it go.

1346
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:12,925
But one thing.

1347
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,568
Now l can't withstand this
pressure anymore.

1348
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,738
That is not complex, ego problem,
or any such thing.

1349
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,634
lt is the question of my identity.

1350
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:22,275
Now should l do whatever Balu telIs me to do?
Should l stand on the road and shout?

1351
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,877
Hey you don't have to take
that much effort.

1352
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,379
At least that director and producer
should know who l am.

1353
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:32,281
l will inform, but not now.

1354
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:34,114
But after the release of this film.

1355
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:37,519
lf they come to know now they will
feel that it was a big betrayal.

1356
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:39,792
what big betrayal?

1357
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:41,758
Did they ask you while they selected
you whether you were married?

1358
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:42,987
lf you say you are married
will they say no?

1359
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,893
lf so, then why did you
do such a disguise?

1360
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,998
As a make-up man.

1361
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,897
You should have told them then
that you were a husband.

1362
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:50,833
why do you think that
a husband is low?

1363
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,531
True, now l feel that way.
when l see such a bad complex.

1364
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,871
Have you gone mad?
- Yes. All of you are making me mad.

1365
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,876
Enough. Enough of it now.

1366
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:02,950
Your director and producer
are in the room, isn't it?

1367
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,778
l will break open everything today.

1368
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:06,817
Hey, Balu just hold on.
Listen to what l say.

1369
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,114
Just leave me.

1370
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,553
Hey you go.
Go and stop him. Oh God.

1371
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,936
Hey just don't rush in
and create a problem.

1372
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,469
Just listen to what l am saying.
- Stand aside.

1373
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:30,907
what is it?

1374
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,814
Are you suffering from memory loss?
You stare frighten the people?

1375
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:38,383
To break open the door and enter is
this your wife's house? lnsolent brute.

1376
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,383
You don't teach me manners.

1377
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:45,150
As long as l finish what l want to say
no one should speak one word here.

1378
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,662
l haven't come here to create
any problem.

1379
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:53,459
l have come here to let you
all know who l am.

1380
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:58,828
l see. Then you are drunk, isn't it?
l drink, sometimes he drinks too.

1381
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:04,842
Yet have you seen us talking
rudely like this with anyone?

1382
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:11,511
Okay, now even l am drunk.

1383
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,621
l am not talking as a make-up man.
l am speaking as the husband of Surya.

1384
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:19,754
Hey. Due to circumstances
l wore this disguise.

1385
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,121
Now you do shooting only after you
come to know everything.

1386
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,456
Just stop it. will you take him and go?

1387
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,723
we too are sitting here drinking.

1388
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,163
Now if he opens his mouth
l will start beating him.

1389
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:31,169
Before beating and kicking, you ask him
he was a witness to our marriage.

1390
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:32,203
Is it so?

1391
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,501
Hey, no. Hey, what am l hearing?

1392
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,769
Just because l am a friend should
you say such things?

1393
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:40,345
My dear sir, pardon me.
He is a little drunk.

1394
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,516
lt is because he is not used to it.

1395
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,283
Tell me, who is she to me?

1396
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:47,455
Leave him! what are you doing?

1397
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:48,679
lf not.. even that is not needed.

1398
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,824
l don't want to prove by your mouth.

1399
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,392
l have other proof with me.

1400
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,825
Here. See this. Our marriage photo.

1401
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,329
See if this fellow's face is in this?

1402
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,997
Just don't laugh,
just tell what the matter is.

1403
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,774
Sir did you see the relations
who came for the marriage?

1404
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:13,744
Sarasamma, Jisukutty, Vatsala,
Kochu Gunju, Vembayum, Purusum.

1405
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:16,473
You know all these people, isn't it?
All are junior artists, isn't it?

1406
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:20,085
You take a snap with all of them
and show it as your marriage snap?

1407
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:21,619
Hey, if you show your lowly class..

1408
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:22,755
Stand aside man.

1409
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,591
There, she will tell you.

1410
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,127
will you believe, if she telIs you?

1411
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,126
Enough.

1412
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,355
lf Surya says it is enough.

1413
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,557
Tell me, who is he to you?

1414
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:35,694
My..

1415
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,700
My make-up man.

1416
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,044
Surya.

1417
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,380
Apart from that is there any other
relationship between you two?

1418
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:52,549
No.

1419
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,852
Hey, just get out from here.

1420
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:02,052
l don't want to see you on
the sets anymore.

1421
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:15,359
Central

1422
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,829
Oh my God. You saved me.

1423
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:47,833
Siddarth. You did great.

1424
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,430
Let me kiss you.

1425
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,034
Thank you. Thank you.

1426
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,071
lt was good. Very good.

1427
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,038
Then you won't say anything eIse.

1428
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:58,075
You small thief.
- Get lost from here.

1429
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:00,373
Thank you. Thank you.

1430
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:02,243
This is what sir has done.

1431
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:11,520
Surya, this is your victory. Congrats.

1432
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,767
Thank you. Thank you.

1433
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,267
Chakochha, l am saved.

1434
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,496
There is no doubt..
it will run at least 100 days.

1435
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:27,734
Okay, bye.

1436
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:31,437
Every one said that it was very good.

1437
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,116
Balu.

1438
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:43,953
Hey, Surya.

1439
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,561
She must be coming with that director.

1440
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,629
Then let her come.
Aunt, you get in.

1441
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,864
Balu,

1442
01:27:58,139 --> 01:27:59,572
where were you till now?

1443
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,004
How many days l enquired about you?

1444
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,643
Even when l call you,
you don't answer my call.

1445
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,772
Come, l want to talk.

1446
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:09,643
To talk about what?

1447
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:12,945
lf a great actress like you starts
talking to people

1448
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,644
who are passing by then your image
will be tarnished.

1449
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:20,521
Now if the people who are here misunderstand
that l am your lover or husband etc..

1450
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:22,855
..then your future will be ruined, isn't it?

1451
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,733
Then because of you l learned a trade.

1452
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:28,959
what trade did she teach you?

1453
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,502
Sister, will you aIso teach us that trade?

1454
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,664
Hey don't do that.

1455
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,634
Balu, come let me tell you something.

1456
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:40,871
Leave it.
l heard a lot of what you had to say.

1457
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:43,277
who do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?

1458
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:46,180
Or Aishwarya Rai?
You have just done one film isn't it?

1459
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:47,115
Balu!

1460
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:50,450
Usually, when 5-6 films are over then they
remove people who are close to them.

1461
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,525
After that don't discard your own father.

1462
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:57,330
There are reasons for whatever l said.
- Yes there will be.

1463
01:28:57,432 --> 01:29:01,198
Even those women who sell their honour and
make a living aIso have many reasons to say.

1464
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:04,635
But don't serve all those before me.

1465
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:09,565
Balu. what a villainous thing
did you say now?

1466
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:10,869
Hey you most lowly person.

1467
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:12,979
Now if you open your mouth
you will get beaten by me.

1468
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:21,615
Stand aside all of you.

1469
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,524
People make a nuisance.

1470
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:29,856
Start the car. Start the car.

1471
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:31,997
Haven't you all seen cinema actresses?

1472
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:32,996
Stand aside now.

1473
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:33,997
Thank you.

1474
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:37,068
l thought that you will be
going with, Deepak.

1475
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:39,869
Shall we go?

1476
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:53,053
Surya, today evening we have
a celebration party of our movie.

1477
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:55,347
lf you want to invite any friends
of yours call them.

1478
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:10,594
Central

1479
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:16,907
Your acting was very good.
Congrats.

1480
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:17,702
Thanks.

1481
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:21,109
when l saw the applause and shouts
in the theatre l was a little afraid.

1482
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:25,718
whether this celebrity status
will affect ours lives or not.

1483
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,389
Now why don't you say anything?

1484
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:34,051
lt is Deepak's fear, isn't it?
what can l say?

1485
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:38,426
Surya, l want a decision.
Tell me, when is the marriage?

1486
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:39,861
whatever it is, it is not soon.

1487
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:43,264
Then? Should l walk behind
you like a buffoon?

1488
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,166
Did l say that you should do so?

1489
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:49,810
Deepak, now whenever a marriage takes place
my husband won't be, Deepak.

1490
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,544
l am sorry to have delayed
in saying this.

1491
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,410
l like a person very much.

1492
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:00,650
Did you hear what is in
your daughter's mind?

1493
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:05,892
when l was introducing you as the woman l am
going to marry couldn't you've told me earlier?

1494
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:08,584
ldiot.. Hmm.

1495
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:15,765
Dear, what is all this?
- Dad, please don't ask me anything more.

1496
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:18,264
The report is good from everywhere.

1497
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,233
Anamika is doing great.

1498
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:23,604
All the films that l did with new faces this's the
first time that l'm getting such a good report.

1499
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:25,108
Anyway, see the movie and
then call me.

1500
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:25,779
Thank you.

1501
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,782
You usurped the small girl, isn't it?
You great director.

1502
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:29,847
l usurped? whom?

1503
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:33,350
Do you know even before she became an
actress their marriage was fixed.

1504
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:36,521
To entrap the girIs who come to
act is your hobby, isn't it?

1505
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:38,123
Stop it. Don't talk nonsense.

1506
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,123
So, it was you and her who
spoke this nonsense.

1507
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,728
The director and heroine live together.
l won't come as a villain.

1508
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:43,794
what all are you saying?

1509
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,728
This is what she told us.
Your Anamika.

1510
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:57,008
Surya.
- Sir.

1511
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:01,815
That Deepak came and said
many things and went away.

1512
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:08,482
lf you don't like him don't.. but then to get rid
of Deepak, should you say such a big lie?

1513
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:12,484
lt is not a lie, sir.
what l said is 100% truth.

1514
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:16,094
l wanted to tell everything openly.
But l couldn't do so.

1515
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:17,491
Okay. Okay.

1516
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,463
Life is like that many times.

1517
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:27,904
The stories that we make for films stranger
events happen in real life than those.

1518
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,703
Now my outlook itself has
changed isn't it?

1519
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,506
Not from the cinema, but with life.

1520
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:35,681
Because of you.

1521
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:40,844
we will see in the evening.
Okay at the party. Bye.

1522
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,619
lf you say l cannot go in then?

1523
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:45,883
will you give me the principle
and interest?

1524
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:47,617
lt is quite a while that
l am running behind him.

1525
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,420
You can't go inside and that's final.

1526
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:50,289
l will go.

1527
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:54,262
A mother asked for 50 paise,
but this wareed did not give.

1528
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:54,868
what is it?

1529
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:57,196
One man is shouting there saying
he wants to see Anamika.

1530
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:58,565
A little violently.

1531
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:00,638
l see. lt must be him.

1532
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:02,069
Today l won't go without
getting my money.

1533
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:03,402
whatever anyone does.

1534
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:04,805
Isn't he the brother-in-law
of producer, Paul?

1535
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,742
which, Paul? Not only of Paul,
but aIso your brother-in-law.

1536
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:11,077
Brother-in-law, for now do one thing go
inside and get that Balu who is going..

1537
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:13,983
..to marry that,
Amanika no Anamika and her too.

1538
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:15,450
And then tell him to give a proper
answer for my money.

1539
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:17,180
Money? what is he saying?

1540
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:19,916
lt is notjust Rs. one or two.
lt is Rs. 600000 and its interest.

1541
01:33:20,962 --> 01:33:22,657
He is going to marry her after
the shooting is over.

1542
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:25,331
He would give when they get her money.
That is what he said the other day.

1543
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:26,625
Then they both didn't turn up at all.

1544
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:28,267
Brother-in-law, come here.

1545
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:30,001
Quotation.. wait.
- Okay.

1546
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:34,172
This man called Balu is a make-up man who
works on per day payment basis.

1547
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,434
A fraud who drinks and walks.

1548
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:40,940
we have fired him aIso.
lt is not he who is going to marry her.

1549
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:42,115
lt is me.

1550
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:43,875
Then will l get my money?

1551
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:46,781
l haven't taken any money
from you, isn't it?- No.

1552
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:50,280
lf you want to ask him or say anything
go and do that to him.

1553
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,521
Now if you are seen anywhere
around here..

1554
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:55,722
Nowjust take them and leave from here.

1555
01:33:57,164 --> 01:34:00,622
l lost the money that l had and
another man twisted my arm too.

1556
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:06,296
Hey, Balu now if ever l get you in my hand
Ah it is very painful, ah!

1557
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:10,967
The victory of a cinema lies 99.9% in
the hands of the production controller.

1558
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:13,146
Then the director..
- Sir, greetings.

1559
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:14,644
Now what is this?

1560
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,646
A total change in sir's outlook?

1561
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:19,581
who doesn't like a change?
- lt looks very nice.

1562
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:22,153
Thank you.
- l thought it is some male nurse.

1563
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:26,524
All of you please pay attention.

1564
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:28,427
l must be getting some dose.

1565
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,663
Shooting days increased,
budget increased it is all this.

1566
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:36,894
The cinema won,
l am happy for that. A little.

1567
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,664
Oh! Stingy in that aIso, Paul sir?

1568
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:44,342
Son, inside this l have two blocks.

1569
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:51,007
Then if l have to become happy then
my director should at least abuse me a little.

1570
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:55,884
During the shooting
l have troubled him a lot.

1571
01:34:56,957 --> 01:35:00,688
You must come, sir.
You must talk. Please.

1572
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:06,355
This Paul, is our producer
who provides food for all of us.

1573
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:08,626
The man is really a poor fellow.

1574
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:14,800
This director is still a much poorer fellow.
- Hey, be quiet.

1575
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:18,541
Did you see? Only the eyes of
people with a good heart well up.

1576
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:20,880
Quieten. Let it go. Doesn't matter,

1577
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,207
Okay. Okay. Brother Paul.

1578
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:29,884
He has two blocks.
May have to call the ambulance.

1579
01:35:30,157 --> 01:35:32,887
l don't have blocks.
lt is in the highway.

1580
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:38,461
Now then this happiness is not
the happiness of only this film.

1581
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:42,734
Along with this film a new star has risen.

1582
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:46,565
Anamika, whom l introduced to you.

1583
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:48,965
Anamika, please.

1584
01:35:54,749 --> 01:36:00,745
Along with the success celebration of her first
film Anamika, commits her next film aIso.

1585
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:05,915
ln my next film l have two heroines.
The main heroine is Anamika.

1586
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,266
Thank you.

1587
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:17,335
Since the Focus Channel is producing this film
this agreement and formalities etc are made.

1588
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,869
Kichhu. Come here.

1589
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:26,607
Here is 600000.
wareed's account should be settled.

1590
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:31,783
lf possible today itself.
l took it on his guarantee, isn't it?

1591
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,822
l will give one more
thing to give your friend.

1592
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,458
A yellow thread and a
rolled gold holy symbol.

1593
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:46,563
On the name of that Balu,
should not ever come before me.

1594
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,563
Did you do the work
of a man born in a family?

1595
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:56,309
A MBA graduate.

1596
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,137
The moment she saw you she came
running out of the house, isn't it?

1597
01:36:58,345 --> 01:36:58,811
And then what did you do?

1598
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:00,640
You put her to shame before many people.

1599
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:01,974
You are man who should be beaten up.

1600
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:03,912
Hey, it is you who should beaten up.

1601
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:06,985
lt was you before them to get
them married and stir them up.

1602
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:09,213
Oh, so now all the blame
is mine, isn't it?

1603
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,649
That day she eased me
out of there like a beggar.

1604
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,259
Then without feeling anything do you say
l should say sweet things to her?

1605
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:15,359
what do you want me to do?

1606
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:16,823
l too am a human being.

1607
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:19,261
Suddenly all what l had
inside me broke and came out.

1608
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:20,830
Even you said the other way, isn't it?

1609
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:22,161
Yes, l did change and said.

1610
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:25,338
you said you will bring everything in the
open and went to see the director isn't it?

1611
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:27,734
Do you know, since l told her
and frightened her..

1612
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:29,341
..she changed her statement that day.

1613
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:32,611
Surya, go and stop him.

1614
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,439
Hey if this play opens up may be
the shooting will be stopped.

1615
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:37,014
You know how the producer is, right?

1616
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:38,845
lf they ask we will even have
to give them compensation.

1617
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,086
Apart from many loans
what does he have in his hands?

1618
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:44,849
At last the husband wife may have
to lie down on the tracks and die,

1619
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:45,855
remember that.

1620
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:59,702
That day he just left. How many times
l and she called him alternatively.

1621
01:38:02,476 --> 01:38:05,604
Here, she gave you. To get rid
of the troubling Undakkadan..

1622
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:10,650
Here hold it.
Take it and pay of your loans.

1623
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:13,376
Don't throw what you get.
Just swallow it.

1624
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:24,226
where is Surya?

1625
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:26,899
why do you want her now?
She has cut your name off.

1626
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:30,662
She has said that you shouldn't see her
anymore ln the name of the holy symbol.

1627
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:37,070
She left. Do you know her next
film's location is, Hyderabad?

1628
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:40,076
You won't even get a chance
to see her and talk to her.

1629
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:41,578
You just leave her.

1630
01:38:42,616 --> 01:38:45,642
without knowing what was behind,
l left her once, isn't it?

1631
01:38:46,053 --> 01:38:49,318
Now after knowing everything,
l won't leave her brother, Lawrence.

1632
01:38:49,523 --> 01:38:51,423
Hyderabad is not in Antarctica, isn't it?

1633
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:56,255
Yes, go there. You will die after
getting beaten by the Andhra Police.

1634
01:39:13,347 --> 01:39:15,110
Do you know this face?

1635
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:18,110
Is this the one who is the criminal?

1636
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:32,462
Cut it, okay, good. Okay
- Okay, sir. Rewind it.

1637
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:34,133
Raju, you have done it well.
- Thank you, sir.

1638
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:35,131
what have you planned next?

1639
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:39,136
Next is.. a combination scene
of Raju, Chandra, and Anamika.

1640
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,137
Change this make-up
and become fresh.- Okay.

1641
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:43,810
Pramod, Anu..
- Sir.

1642
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:46,138
How is your new assistant?
- Okay, sir.

1643
01:39:46,347 --> 01:39:47,314
Take care of the madam very well.

1644
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:50,142
Surely, sir. Orange juice, Horlicks..

1645
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:53,081
..she is not having anything.
l am having everything.

1646
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:54,549
Shouldn't waste it, isn't it?

1647
01:39:54,755 --> 01:39:56,814
Yes. There is a costume change..
Come here.

1648
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,320
lf the costume is not comfortable
you must tell me. Okay?

1649
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:01,152
Okay sir.

1650
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:02,989
we will go to the location in my car.

1651
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:04,721
Now who is our second heroine?
- Chandra.

1652
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:06,991
Oh, very good acting.

1653
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:08,828
Now if you don't know English it
is very troublesome, isn't it?

1654
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:09,593
what happen?

1655
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:14,001
Yesterday l called downstairs
and ordered a fruit salad in English.

1656
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:17,666
They came in a minute and
cleaned the bathroom and went.

1657
01:40:18,078 --> 01:40:23,106
l asked a woman in housekeeping whether
she could change my bed sheet.

1658
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:26,047
She came running and
slapped me very hard.

1659
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:28,721
Now l said l won't come for
any shooting out of Kerala.

1660
01:40:28,922 --> 01:40:32,050
Either they should study Malayalam
or my dog will learn English.

1661
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:35,620
You look so cute, isn't it?

1662
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:38,562
we will use it in posters.
Or eIse no..

1663
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:39,824
Anu, you select.

1664
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,298
Hey no, it is okay if you select.

1665
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:47,231
Between people who are mutually interested
taking a liberty is a comfort, isn't it?

1666
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:50,899
Anu still behaves as if an artist
behaves with the director.

1667
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:53,173
l know that we are in a location.

1668
01:40:53,347 --> 01:40:55,713
Must be wondering what the
others will think, Isn't it?

1669
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:02,883
Don't waste time just like that.

1670
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:03,715
what?

1671
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:04,948
Sir, can we start the shooting?

1672
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:05,716
For that.. where is Chandra?

1673
01:41:05,926 --> 01:41:07,587
lt is quite a while since
she called from the airport.

1674
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:08,762
There she has arrived, sir.

1675
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:15,726
Hi sir.
- Hi..

1676
01:41:15,936 --> 01:41:17,927
hey..

1677
01:41:18,138 --> 01:41:19,105
Hi.. hi..

1678
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:46,289
Central

1679
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:51,800
This fellow? How is he here?

1680
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:54,803
Hey, l don't want to see his face.

1681
01:41:55,008 --> 01:41:58,205
Now he is a holder of the union card.

1682
01:41:58,412 --> 01:42:00,004
lf you send him off then
it will be a problem.

1683
01:42:00,214 --> 01:42:01,738
Then you know madam Chandra.

1684
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,315
She is one who protects the
people who are with her.

1685
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:07,112
Now if you send him off then that
is enough for her to throw it off and go.

1686
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:09,983
Sir, you don't make it a problem
l will deal with him.

1687
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:12,324
Now this is deliberate visit here.

1688
01:42:12,893 --> 01:42:15,418
Anu you should be careful.
He is a madcap.

1689
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:16,596
You know it, right?

1690
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:19,932
Now it is not very difficult
to get a reason.

1691
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,431
l will chase him away from here.

1692
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,631
Hi Chandra, how are you?
- Hi. l am fine, how are you?

1693
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:27,329
l am good. Did you read the script?

1694
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:29,270
Yes, it is beautiful.
- Thank you.

1695
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:31,000
Get ready soon.
- Okay.

1696
01:42:31,678 --> 01:42:32,576
wait.

1697
01:42:33,013 --> 01:42:35,538
Did you marry again?
- Yes, l couldn't call you.

1698
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:37,376
l will call you in my next marriage. Okay?

1699
01:42:37,584 --> 01:42:38,516
You must come to have food.

1700
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:43,022
l did not expect such a twist.

1701
01:42:43,624 --> 01:42:46,718
You are not a make-up man.
You are the hero.

1702
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:49,725
This is only a sample, now you see.

1703
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,591
Oh, God!

1704
01:42:58,805 --> 01:42:59,931
Hello.
- Hi.

1705
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:16,450
Hey, stand aside.

Centipede?

1710
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:30,262
which place?
- Kerala.

1711
01:43:30,737 --> 01:43:31,863
l am Surya madam's make-up man.

1712
01:43:32,072 --> 01:43:33,539
l am Chandra madam's make-up man.

1713
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,071
Keep in touch.

1714
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:47,985
This glamour shouldn't become a curse.

1715
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:51,147
Hey, did you talk to her
after coming here?

1716
01:43:51,358 --> 01:43:53,121
How could l?
Shouldn't l get a chance?

1717
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:53,816
lt is deliberate.

1718
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:56,154
when l go close,
she just escapes from there.

1719
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:00,495
Hey, she is alone there. Go.

1720
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:02,202
Go.

1721
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:04,336

what is he doing there?
- wait.

1723
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:14,379
You must listen to what l have to say.

1724
01:44:14,681 --> 01:44:17,275
Say it. Let them aIso hear it.

1725
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,450
Have you come to act here?
- No.

1726
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:24,123

This is okay.

Assistant director, isn't it?
- Yes.

1767

That day when you said about me

1797
01:50:06,366 --> 01:50:11,030
when that anger, heart broke and came out,
l did not see the people around us even.

1798
01:50:11,237 --> 01:50:12,534
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1809
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:31,647
Chandra Madam's make-up man..

This stupid Umbrella.

1814
01:50:44,938 --> 01:50:47,668

here to write the dialogue for my film?

1815
01:50:47,874 --> 01:50:48,704
what?

1816
01:50:50,877 --> 01:50:51,400
Did you see this?

1817
01:50:51,611 --> 01:50:53,169
He has done such a work for
which he can be beaten.

1818
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,404
Read this.

1819
01:50:56,950 --> 01:51:00,408
l had dismissed him from my last
film for troubling Anamika.

1820
01:51:01,388 --> 01:51:04,016
And now again he is.. idiot.

1821
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,884
Chandra please, l can't tolerate
this nuisance anymore here.

1822
01:51:07,093 --> 01:51:09,357
He has to be sent off from here.
- Okay.

1823
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:15,628
was this written by you?
- That.. huh..

1824
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:17,200
Yes or no?

1825
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:20,203
Yes, madam.
- Then get lost.

1826
01:51:20,407 --> 01:51:22,534
Madam, just..
- Get lost.

1827
01:51:24,344 --> 01:51:25,743
Settle his account.

1828
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:52,461
Kichha, before he goes ask
him to come and see me.

1829
01:51:53,006 --> 01:51:54,906
This is not the first issue.

1830
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:57,406
lt doesn't happen like that.
There is something in this.

1831
01:51:57,610 --> 01:51:58,577
lt is true, Raju.

1832
01:51:59,345 --> 01:52:01,142
There is a story fit for a film is behind this.

1833
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:21,924
Central

1834
01:52:36,015 --> 01:52:41,453
Considering my mental condition she shouldn't
take more than a minute to pardon me.

1835
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:44,517
lf she can't do that then
what should l understand?

1836
01:52:46,693 --> 01:52:50,686
Not that l don't know to slap her
and take her with me.

1837
01:52:50,897 --> 01:52:54,458
No, her career, fame,
acceptances..

1838
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:56,635
Amongst all that, l am a misfit.

1839
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:58,064
Now no one eIse need to know this.

1840
01:52:58,271 --> 01:53:00,330
Let us assume that this story ends here.

1841
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:02,531
l am leaving.
- You can leave later.

1842
01:53:03,676 --> 01:53:05,803
Raju, shall l get a violin?

1843
01:53:06,012 --> 01:53:08,708
To play the background music
for the dialogues he delivered.

1844
01:53:14,387 --> 01:53:17,015
what story l heard so far it
is not that boring.

1845
01:53:17,223 --> 01:53:20,715
But after struggling so much,
you shouldn't leave it like that.

1846
01:53:21,494 --> 01:53:23,826
Balu, l know.

1847
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:25,759
No matter how big star she is after
all she is a woman, isn't it?

1848
01:53:25,965 --> 01:53:28,092
There must be something left
in her heart.

1849
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:30,235
After knowing that you can leave.

1850
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:31,863
we are with you.

1851
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,567
Now only two more days are
left for shooting to get over.

1852
01:53:36,776 --> 01:53:42,578
For those two days, what if change his
post from that of a make-up man?

1853
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:44,882
A small promotion.

1854
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:48,012
what Chandra?

1855
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:51,320
what is this? lt is getting late.

1856
01:53:51,524 --> 01:53:53,924
Oh God! He must be very angry.

1857
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:57,792
Hey, where is Chandra? lt is two hours
since we are all waiting for her.

1858
01:53:57,997 --> 01:54:00,056
Did she go with that make-up man?
- Can't say for sure.

1859
01:54:00,266 --> 01:54:02,097
She had first fallen in love
with her driver.

1860
01:54:03,102 --> 01:54:04,763
You call her once more.
- Sir, l called.

1861
01:54:04,971 --> 01:54:06,939
She had already got out of her room
and gone to the lobby.

1862
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:11,708
How come Balu went to say this?

1863
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:16,442
Now he will be shocked.

1864
01:54:17,317 --> 01:54:18,716
Has she gone mad?

1865
01:54:19,152 --> 01:54:20,380
Hi, sir.

1866
01:54:23,323 --> 01:54:26,292
Did you see her reading her
father's horoscope?

1867
01:54:31,164 --> 01:54:32,597
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1868
01:54:36,936 --> 01:54:38,233
Yes.
- what is your intention?

1869
01:54:38,438 --> 01:54:39,268
Sir, one sec.

1870
01:54:39,472 --> 01:54:42,635
Hello. l have told you once.

1871
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:46,608
l can't do this petty bargaining those
things you can talk to, Balu.

1872
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:48,804
Yes, l will give. Balu..

1873
01:54:50,283 --> 01:54:50,749
Hello.

1874
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:53,780
Just hold on.

1875
01:54:54,187 --> 01:54:56,655
Sir, what did you ask?
- what is your intention?

1876
01:54:56,856 --> 01:54:58,346
we need a purpose for
this drama, isn't it?

1877
01:54:58,558 --> 01:54:59,684
Didn't l fire him?

1878
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:01,656
lt is me who has to fire him.

1879
01:55:01,861 --> 01:55:03,556
Even you wouldn't have fired him.

1880
01:55:03,763 --> 01:55:06,493
lf Balu had come in this manner.
lt is true..

1881
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:08,223
Balu had made a mistake.

1882
01:55:08,434 --> 01:55:13,098
An MBA man is not needed to hold a
mirror and umbrella to an actress.

1883
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:20,772
Due to Balu's circumstances
that was necessary.

1884
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:22,971
what circumstances?
what necessity?

1885
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:25,116
Now there is no need to tell that.

1886
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:27,777
Those needs are all over.

1887
01:55:29,322 --> 01:55:30,914
Balu, was my make-up man.

1888
01:55:31,124 --> 01:55:36,687
Now he's one who manages all my affairs but
if l say 'Manager' it will be very small for him.

1889
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:40,763
Now, what is he for me,
l don't know.

1890
01:55:41,734 --> 01:55:43,929
l don't care if he becomes someone of
yours or not do whatever you want.

1891
01:55:44,137 --> 01:55:45,695
This is my film, My location.

1892
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:50,535
Just shut up, you villain. Just stop your high
handedness and other things over here.

1893
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:53,143
Or eIse l will stamp and
twist your neck.

1894
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:56,544
why aren't you talking?
Has your tongue got tied.

1895
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:00,447
what is the problem here?

1896
01:56:00,653 --> 01:56:02,086
Are you doing some sort of show here?

1897
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:04,848
Sir, don't. Just forget it.
The shooting is getting over tomorrow.

1898
01:56:05,058 --> 01:56:07,549
Let's organize the pack up party
and let's all happily part.

1899
01:56:10,363 --> 01:56:12,024
You became a manager
for a couple of days.

1900
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:14,756
what did you make?
we are in the pack up party now.

1901
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:17,163
lnstead ofjust standing here,
just go and have couple of drinks.

1902
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:19,736
Then you must have a control like me.

1903
01:56:19,939 --> 01:56:21,566
Okay? Go.

1904
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:32,675
Central

1905
01:56:35,254 --> 01:56:37,688
Hello, sir. Come. Come.

1906
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:40,358
Though you said you would try
to come, l was sure.

1907
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,687
l am on a Delhi trip.
A two day programme.

1908
01:56:42,895 --> 01:56:43,884
lt is pack up, isn't it?

1909
01:56:44,097 --> 01:56:45,428
l said l will just touch and then leave.

1910
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:46,290
Didn't know.

1911
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:47,295
Raju..

1912
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:48,933
Everyone is seen only when
the shooting is over.

1913
01:56:49,135 --> 01:56:50,227
This is Rajan, Kuruvilla.
- Hello.

1914
01:56:50,436 --> 01:56:52,700
Chairman of Focus TV.
Producer of our film.

1915
01:56:52,905 --> 01:56:54,236
Greetings. l have heard
a lot about you.

1916
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:55,737
But haven't been able
to meet you till now.

1917
01:56:55,942 --> 01:56:57,739
Nice to meet you, Raju.
- Thank you.

1918
01:56:57,944 --> 01:56:59,502
This is the first production
of the channel.

1919
01:56:59,712 --> 01:57:03,375
Before release l have planned
a few promotional programmes.

1920
01:57:03,583 --> 01:57:04,880
All of you should co-operate.
- Sure.

1921
01:57:05,084 --> 01:57:07,644
Sir can plan anything, l will break it.

1922
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:08,445
what?

1923
01:57:08,654 --> 01:57:11,248
l mean l will make it a grand affair.
l can only do that.

1924
01:57:11,457 --> 01:57:12,253
Sir, one minute.

1925
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:13,015
Excuse me.

1926
01:57:13,226 --> 01:57:14,215
He didn't say excuse to me.

1927
01:57:14,427 --> 01:57:17,123
Hey, what is this Kichha?
Don't you want a place?

1928
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:19,628
what place?

1929
01:57:22,435 --> 01:57:25,700
Surya, just five minutes.
l have to talk to you.

1930
01:57:25,905 --> 01:57:26,894
what is it, Raju?

1931
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:29,906
Neither me or Raju want to talk.

1932
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:31,634
Balu, wants to.

1933
01:57:33,012 --> 01:57:36,243
Balu had told about things to
be told in only five minutes?

1934
01:57:37,517 --> 01:57:41,146
lf you have the heart to hear
l don't need even five minutes.

1935
01:57:42,188 --> 01:57:45,919
But if l hear it, shouldn't
l say anything?

1936
01:57:46,826 --> 01:57:49,693
Something that women who
sell their honour and live.

1937
01:57:49,896 --> 01:57:51,591
lt won't be over in five minutes.

1938
01:57:58,071 --> 01:58:02,474
Even after you sweated and
tried she didn't even stand.

1939
01:58:02,675 --> 01:58:04,666
Now, don't try any more.

1940
01:58:04,877 --> 01:58:10,611
Now say goodbye to her with
dignity then go your own way.

1941
01:58:11,317 --> 01:58:13,114
l feel very sad for you.

1942
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:16,148
Sir, one second.

1943
01:58:19,192 --> 01:58:26,030
Hey. Stand there.
l said, stand there.

1944
01:58:26,232 --> 01:58:29,030
l haven't come to say that you should
take me back as your husband.

1945
01:58:29,235 --> 01:58:31,135
l made a mistake.
when l came to know the truth.

1946
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:33,601
l thought of correcting that.
That is all.

1947
01:58:33,806 --> 01:58:34,636
Is it over?

1948
01:58:34,841 --> 01:58:36,468
lt is not over.
l have a lot more to say.

1949
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:38,405
Laying hands on my artists, you idiot?

1950
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:41,444
Ask him to stand aside or
eIse l'll beat him to pulp.

1951
01:58:41,647 --> 01:58:42,636
l see you have come to that stage?

1952
01:58:42,849 --> 01:58:45,079
Isn't there any security or police?
l will show you.

1953
01:58:45,284 --> 01:58:47,275
You don't want beating,
you need a good stamping on.

1954
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:49,810
Don't, sir.

1955
01:58:54,093 --> 01:58:56,891
why are you standing here?
Can't you leave?

1956
01:58:57,463 --> 01:58:58,930
Bygones are bygones.

1957
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:01,794
At least now can't you remain
without punishing me?

1958
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:13,411
You are in Bombay, isn't it?
- Yes, in Bombay.

1959
01:59:15,381 --> 01:59:18,009
we will see you at Trivandrum.
l will call you, bye.

1960
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:20,144
Sir.. l want..

1961
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:22,378
Sir, l am leaving.
- Okay, see you.

1962
01:59:22,588 --> 01:59:23,816
Bye, Siddharth.

1963
01:59:24,023 --> 01:59:26,685
Anu.. your father has come isn't it?

1964
01:59:27,059 --> 01:59:29,220
l won't see him now but later
l will come home and see him.

1965
01:59:29,428 --> 01:59:30,759
Formally. Okay

1966
01:59:33,132 --> 01:59:34,599
See you. Bye.

1967
01:59:36,302 --> 01:59:37,234
Hi, sir.

1968
01:59:37,436 --> 01:59:38,767
Hi James. How come you
are here in civil dress?

1969
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:40,529
l am on duty, sir. l have to catch a man.

1970
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:41,297
Pritviraj.

1971
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:43,134
Don't l know him? l am a fan of yours.

1972
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:46,106
James is in the police. He has shown
his face in a couple of my films.

1973
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:48,003
Okay James, thanks.
- Thank you sir, see you.

1974
01:59:48,214 --> 01:59:49,272
Call me later.
- Yes.

1975
01:59:49,949 --> 01:59:50,938
what, Raju?

1976
01:59:51,317 --> 01:59:53,877
Sir, five minutes at the coffee shop.

1977
01:59:59,258 --> 02:00:00,350
l..

1978
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:07,625
who is it? l don't know you.

1979
02:00:07,833 --> 02:00:09,232
we will know each other in detail.

1980
02:00:09,435 --> 02:00:12,268
For nowjust know that l am
police inspector. Come on.

1981
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:17,331
Sir, a character who loves
and respects everyone.

1982
02:00:17,543 --> 02:00:22,071
ln the name of one way love that man becomes
a buffoon by himself in a situation.

1983
02:00:22,281 --> 02:00:23,714
what does sir feel?

1984
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:26,407
lf in cinema there is a chance
of a good humour.

1985
02:00:27,987 --> 02:00:29,818
My intention wasn't in cinema.

1986
02:00:31,424 --> 02:00:34,052
You shouldn't become a joker in life.

1987
02:00:34,727 --> 02:00:38,356
Surya, came out escaping a marriage
was not to act in a film.

1988
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:41,431
lt was to live with the one whom she loved.

1989
02:00:42,668 --> 02:00:46,502
Surya and Balu got married
on that day itself.

1990
02:00:49,709 --> 02:00:53,941
ln the present fight between them though
both of them have their own reasons.

1991
02:00:54,146 --> 02:00:57,946
they are not that respectful
which can be forgotten.

1992
02:00:58,985 --> 02:01:01,249
ln this matter if you further go ahead
you will get a shock.

1993
02:01:01,454 --> 02:01:04,446
l am telling you this now only to
avoid that shock for you.

1994
02:01:06,859 --> 02:01:09,851
lt is Kichha who knows
more about them.

1995
02:01:19,939 --> 02:01:25,673
when you know so much, instead of marrying
a person who doesn't know what is cinema..

1996
02:01:25,878 --> 02:01:28,472
..wont it be better to marry her,
that is how l thought.

1997
02:01:29,515 --> 02:01:31,847
l don't think my feeling is wrong.

1998
02:01:32,051 --> 02:01:34,144
Because he doesn't deserve her.

1999
02:01:39,992 --> 02:01:43,155
Today is Friday, if you are remanded you will
be inside at least for three days.

2000
02:01:43,663 --> 02:01:45,290
Since it is a cheque case,
l am telling you.

2001
02:01:45,431 --> 02:01:48,195
lf you can give the full amount and settle
you call someone and get him here.

2002
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:49,060
Don't you know?

2003
02:01:49,268 --> 02:01:52,169
This man has got warrant handover from
the court and then l have held you.

2004
02:01:52,605 --> 02:01:54,368
Call. Call that Anamika.

2005
02:01:54,573 --> 02:01:56,165
Isn't she the one who you
are going to marry?

2006
02:01:56,375 --> 02:01:58,240
Does sir know, he is going
to marry Anamika.

2007
02:01:58,444 --> 02:02:00,503
That day he took time saying
when the shooting finishes

2008
02:02:00,713 --> 02:02:01,577
l will get my money.

2009
02:02:01,781 --> 02:02:04,113
Later l cam to know that he
is only her make-up man.

2010
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:06,342
l see. Then you are a great man.

2011
02:02:06,552 --> 02:02:08,645
How many people did you borrow
from on her name?

2012
02:02:08,854 --> 02:02:09,411
Tell me.

2013
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:12,523
Sir, l haven't told her name and
took any money from any one.

2014
02:02:12,725 --> 02:02:15,159
ln fact, Surya is my wife, sir.

2015
02:02:15,361 --> 02:02:16,020
Surya?

2016
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:17,786
Then you said you were going
to marry Anamika to him?

2017
02:02:17,997 --> 02:02:19,362
Sir her original name is, Surya.

2018
02:02:19,565 --> 02:02:21,590
The director named her Anamika
for cinema.

2019
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:24,599
Big liar. He is again making stories.
Don't believe him, sir. lt is all lies.

2020
02:02:24,804 --> 02:02:26,533
Sir if you want, you call Surya
and ask her.

2021
02:02:26,739 --> 02:02:28,536
You said it is a name that
the director gave, isn't it? - Yes.

2022
02:02:28,674 --> 02:02:30,403
l will call Siddharth sir
and ask him.

2023
02:02:33,145 --> 02:02:36,046
Sir, this is Sl James.
we met at the airport today.

2024
02:02:36,248 --> 02:02:39,411
Not for the chance, sir.
To know one thing.

2025
02:02:39,618 --> 02:02:42,553
The original name of actress
Anamika is the same?

2026
02:02:42,755 --> 02:02:44,017
why such a doubt now?

2027
02:02:44,223 --> 02:02:46,350
No sir, l have caught a person
in a cheque case.

2028
02:02:46,559 --> 02:02:49,892
Says he is Anamika's husband..
- who, Balachandran?

2029
02:02:50,096 --> 02:02:53,224
That he was Anamika's
make-up man is true.

2030
02:02:53,432 --> 02:02:55,957
Because of such behaviour
l dismissed him too.

2031
02:02:56,168 --> 02:02:59,228
Sir, if Anamika madam is nearby
can you give the phone to her?

2032
02:03:01,273 --> 02:03:02,297
One minute.

2033
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:06,635
Anamika, we will know now.

2034
02:03:09,915 --> 02:03:12,907
James, l spoke with Anamika.

2035
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:15,583
She is afraid that it may become a news.

2036
02:03:15,788 --> 02:03:17,187
Can James do a small help?

2037
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:20,325
Can you get in writing from him saying
he is in no way related to Anamika?

2038
02:03:20,526 --> 02:03:21,857
Sir that..

2039
02:03:22,061 --> 02:03:24,723
ln our next film there is
a role of a commissioner.

2040
02:03:24,930 --> 02:03:26,056
James should do that.

2041
02:03:26,265 --> 02:03:27,163
Okay, sir.

2042
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:30,267
l will make him write it well and get it.

2043
02:03:31,437 --> 02:03:32,369
You beggar.

2044
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:36,337
You not only behaved like a ruffian above
that you stand there say you are her husband?

2045
02:03:36,542 --> 02:03:38,601
Sir, give his snap and report in
the papers or a channel.

2046
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:39,539
Let it be known all over.

2047
02:03:39,745 --> 02:03:43,340
Then all the people who lent him
money will come here like a rally.

2048
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:46,211
Oh, you feel nice to put people from
the film in problem isn't it?

2049
02:03:46,419 --> 02:03:47,647
Shouldn't l get my money sir?

2050
02:03:47,853 --> 02:03:49,286
George, record the arrest.

2051
02:03:49,488 --> 02:03:50,648
Again?

2052
02:03:50,856 --> 02:03:54,189
Balu, Anamika is afraid that
this may become a news.

2053
02:03:54,393 --> 02:03:57,419
Hence, you must write in your
own hand and sign it saying

2054
02:03:57,630 --> 02:03:59,689
that you don't have any relationship
with her and give it to me.

2055
02:03:59,899 --> 02:04:02,197
George, give him a pen and paper.

2056
02:04:08,407 --> 02:04:10,204
Then you write.

2057
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:13,470
To whomsoever it may concern..

2058
02:04:13,913 --> 02:04:17,212
Balachandran, son of
Kalappuraikkal Madhavan Pillai

2059
02:04:17,483 --> 02:04:19,212
swears hereby what is written
below is true.

2060
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:26,381
l as a person served as a make-up man
to actress Anamika for two months..

2061
02:04:26,592 --> 02:04:31,928
and apart from that whether individually or
through family have no relationship with her.

2062
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:34,224
l swear it to be true.

2063
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:36,659
You know his handwriting, isn't it?

2064
02:04:41,207 --> 02:04:44,404
May be on getting caught in a case, must have
given in writing to avoid making news.

2065
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:46,441
l was greatly in love with Balu, sir.

2066
02:04:46,645 --> 02:04:51,981
without any interest l agreed to act in
one film and pay of his loans.

2067
02:04:52,184 --> 02:04:53,674
This Balu did not understand.

2068
02:04:53,886 --> 02:04:56,684
No, let it finish like this. That is all.

2069
02:04:56,889 --> 02:04:59,449
Balu was just a medium through
which you came into the films.

2070
02:04:59,658 --> 02:05:01,353
Surya should only think that.

2071
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:05,257
Shall daddy say a think which
you have to decide now?

2072
02:05:05,598 --> 02:05:08,396
Though accidentally you got
a career, that is cinema.

2073
02:05:08,601 --> 02:05:09,863
An environment of that.

2074
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:13,368
what you need now is a man
who likes and knows that field.

2075
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:24,706
Central

2076
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:30,011
Seeing your look you may feel
l just got out after a life imprisonment.

2077
02:05:30,222 --> 02:05:31,985
lt was only a picnic of 3-4 days.
That is all.

2078
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:34,056
How lightly you say all this.

2079
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:37,161
Hey man if you get drenched fully
then you don't feel cold.

2080
02:05:37,363 --> 02:05:40,491
Since l got wet, l have decided
to take a bath itself.

2081
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:42,690
She was afraid that it would
become a news isn't it?

2082
02:05:42,902 --> 02:05:44,164
You get into the car.

2083
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:46,235
Are you going to call for
a press conference?

2084
02:05:46,438 --> 02:05:47,666
l don't have to do that.

2085
02:05:47,873 --> 02:05:50,307
without calling the media
will come after me.

2086
02:05:54,947 --> 02:05:55,743
Hello.

2087
02:05:59,852 --> 02:06:01,979
Your voice control and
modulation was too good.

2088
02:06:02,187 --> 02:06:03,313
Keep it up.
- Thank you, sir.

2089
02:06:03,522 --> 02:06:06,423
Sir. There is some news on
the TV regarding Anamika madam.

2090
02:06:08,527 --> 02:06:12,588
He says he got married to Anamika
before she had become a star.

2091
02:06:12,798 --> 02:06:16,996
Yet that marriage which was not done
in the usual traditional manner..

2092
02:06:17,202 --> 02:06:20,103
and he wants that the marriage should
be cancelled and declared void.

2093
02:06:20,306 --> 02:06:23,104
Balachandran further states in his application
that he should be allowed to divorce her.

2094
02:06:30,316 --> 02:06:34,082
lf you think then we experience when
eyes and hands co-ordinate together.

2095
02:06:34,286 --> 02:06:38,017
Hence creative side and the
technical side should be alert.

2096
02:06:38,223 --> 02:06:39,190
Then..

2097
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:42,750
Okay we will continue later.
- Okay, sir.

2098
02:06:45,698 --> 02:06:47,461
There are many days for the
release of the film.

2099
02:06:47,666 --> 02:06:50,032
Do you have any idea as to how
this issue will affect the film?

2100
02:06:50,235 --> 02:06:51,429
lt will surely have an adverse effect.

2101
02:06:51,637 --> 02:06:55,471
That is sure.
what if we postpone the release?

2102
02:06:55,674 --> 02:06:57,471
Otherwise, l don't see any
other way out.

2103
02:06:59,078 --> 02:07:00,909
lf so we have found a way.

2104
02:07:01,146 --> 02:07:03,341
ln this channel competition our channel
was one channel was known

2105
02:07:03,549 --> 02:07:06,416
for so long for any famous
mentionable thing.

2106
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:09,281
Now, we got hot topic.
Haven't you heard the saying.

2107
02:07:09,488 --> 02:07:12,218
The cow will get relief from its itching.
The crow will get its meal.

2108
02:07:12,424 --> 02:07:14,892
The cow is our cinema.
The crow is our channel.

2109
02:07:15,861 --> 02:07:19,490
Our channel is going to take up this divorce
issue and take maximum mileage out of it.

2110
02:07:20,099 --> 02:07:20,929
That..

2111
02:07:21,133 --> 02:07:24,591
whatever Anamika has to say
will all be told only to our channel.

2112
02:07:24,803 --> 02:07:27,237
lnterview, talk show phone in programme,
in between thatjust like sauce..

2113
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:32,502
..for a dish we pepper the show with the video
clippings in which we covered our shootings.

2114
02:07:32,945 --> 02:07:34,640
ln that.. Balu will aIso come.

2115
02:07:34,847 --> 02:07:39,079
But in court either she or her lawyer agree
to what Balu says then everything is over.

2116
02:07:39,284 --> 02:07:40,615
They will get a divorce in just one day.

2117
02:07:40,819 --> 02:07:44,084
l know. But we shouldn't allow
her to do so.

2118
02:07:44,289 --> 02:07:49,192
Later in a manner which even she can't
change she herself object to this relationship.

2119
02:07:49,395 --> 02:07:50,919
ln the court and channel
she should refuse to so.

2120
02:07:52,898 --> 02:07:55,628
Now what if she doesn't do
as we think.

2121
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:58,667
She will have to agree to it.
l will tell you the way for it.

2122
02:07:58,871 --> 02:07:59,769
Let that be.

2123
02:07:59,972 --> 02:08:02,668
l heard about your interest
in Anamika from the location.

2124
02:08:02,875 --> 02:08:05,605
Now she was about to come
to that decision..

2125
02:08:05,811 --> 02:08:08,006
..but in between this came
and things went awry.

2126
02:08:08,213 --> 02:08:12,582
Don't worry man. lf this goes
ahead as we expect it..

2127
02:08:12,785 --> 02:08:14,878
..go ahead its climax will be
your marriage with her.

2128
02:08:17,256 --> 02:08:18,052
Yes, come in.

2129
02:08:19,224 --> 02:08:20,623
This is advocate Krishnakumar.

2130
02:08:20,926 --> 02:08:21,449
Hello.
- Hello.

2131
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:24,220
He will appear for Anamika.

2132
02:08:24,797 --> 02:08:27,129
You should make her sign on the written
papers to fight her case.

2133
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:32,470
Then the way to make her comply
that l will explain to you.

2134
02:08:36,008 --> 02:08:39,910
lt is 10.5 million that the company is
going to ask Surya as compensation.

2135
02:08:40,112 --> 02:08:41,443
what a mess this is?

2136
02:08:41,647 --> 02:08:43,945
Marriage is a personal affair
of individuaIs, isn't it?

2137
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:45,480
For that compensation for them?

2138
02:08:45,684 --> 02:08:48,517
what is typed in the
agreement is, Ms. Anamika.

2139
02:08:48,721 --> 02:08:50,211
Surya has signed on it too.

2140
02:08:50,422 --> 02:08:54,415
lf they had known that she was married,
they would have taken another heroine.

2141
02:08:55,294 --> 02:08:56,784
That is what they are saying.
l am really helpless.

2142
02:08:56,995 --> 02:09:00,192
Isn't Cinema a show business?

2143
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:04,096
Sir, l will see Balu, and
tell him to withdraw from this.

2144
02:09:04,303 --> 02:09:07,295
what did l do to Balu that
he's torturing me so much?

2145
02:09:07,506 --> 02:09:10,100
Now there is no use for you
to see Balu and talk.

2146
02:09:10,309 --> 02:09:11,674
This has already become a news.

2147
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:14,412
Oh God, even if l get
what people owe me and sell all

2148
02:09:14,613 --> 02:09:16,945
what l have l won't get
half the amount they ask.

2149
02:09:18,317 --> 02:09:22,651
Now for a move to avoid the
compensation the company is ready.

2150
02:09:22,855 --> 02:09:28,953
But Surya will have to take a very bold stand.
ln the court as well as outside.

2151
02:09:29,661 --> 02:09:32,152
l mean in channel and the media.

2152
02:09:32,364 --> 02:09:34,696
Such a marriage has not
taken place at all.

2153
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:37,960
what is immediately needed
is Surya's TV interview.

2154
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:39,603
You have to say this same
thing in it aIso.

2155
02:09:39,805 --> 02:09:41,830
Such a marriage hasn't
taken place at all.

2156
02:09:48,814 --> 02:09:51,305
ln a few moments the famous
cinema star Anamika.

2157
02:09:51,517 --> 02:09:55,009
will speak to the viewers regarding
her disputed marriage.

2158
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:57,085
Lawyer, you must listen carefully
what she is saying.

2159
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:57,812
lt is an interview.

2160
02:09:58,023 --> 02:10:00,651
Tomorrow in the court you will get
something to fry her with in this.

2161
02:10:00,859 --> 02:10:04,590
That you need not tell me specially.
l will do so.

2162
02:10:04,797 --> 02:10:06,389
An apt lawyer who can argue.

2163
02:10:06,598 --> 02:10:09,158
Now when you eat something does
this hiccup come there too?

2164
02:10:09,368 --> 02:10:10,198
Thank God, no.

2165
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:12,802
This hiccup is the victory
for lawyer Mathai.

2166
02:10:13,005 --> 02:10:15,735
while l argue l get time to think.

2167
02:10:16,041 --> 02:10:20,478
Our favourite star who impressed all in
her first film itself, Anamika is here to talk

2168
02:10:20,679 --> 02:10:24,513
about her personal life and marriage.

2169
02:10:24,716 --> 02:10:29,085
when l was doing the first film,
Balachandran was my personal make-up man.

2170
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:35,426
Since he misbehaved with the director on the
sets he was dismissed from there at that time.

2171
02:10:36,395 --> 02:10:41,423
Then in the recent movie he was the
make-up man for actress Chandra too.

2172
02:10:43,902 --> 02:10:49,534
Then there are chances that such a divorce
petition against actress, Chandra too, isn't it?

2173
02:10:50,843 --> 02:10:52,606
That possibility too is there, isn't it?

2174
02:10:53,245 --> 02:10:53,904
Yes.

2175
02:10:55,881 --> 02:10:57,542
Ram, call now.

2176
02:11:02,321 --> 02:11:05,916
Hello, Mr. Balachandran,
l am calling from Focus TV.

2177
02:11:06,325 --> 02:11:11,388
Our channel is interested to do an interview
with you regarding your divorce case.

2178
02:11:11,864 --> 02:11:15,095
l don't have any objection,
when so much has happened..

2179
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:18,463
l will tell what l would say in court
before you TV people.

2180
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:19,634
Okay.

2181
02:11:20,706 --> 02:11:23,470
Just in two days you see the rating of
the channel jumping to new heights.

2182
02:11:23,842 --> 02:11:27,300
The other channel's prime time shows and
reality shows will all fall on its face.

2183
02:11:27,512 --> 02:11:29,139
You people will keep playing
and make a mess of it.

2184
02:11:29,348 --> 02:11:33,478
You don't have to fear, the bonus that you
will get is the heroine herself isn't it?

2185
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:38,080
This wasn't for putting any one
in shame or to get them back.

2186
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:42,624
when she starts thinking about her new life
earlier marriage should not be an obstacle.

2187
02:11:42,828 --> 02:11:44,261
That is all my intention is.

2188
02:11:44,463 --> 02:11:47,398
lf Anamika wasn't a star,
this would have just another divorce case

2189
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:51,093
like other tens of thousands
of divorce cases.

2190
02:12:00,445 --> 02:12:00,968
what do you people want to know?

2191
02:12:01,179 --> 02:12:02,168
we want to ask Balachandran.
- Then ask me.

2192
02:12:02,381 --> 02:12:03,211
we don't have anything to ask you.

2193
02:12:03,415 --> 02:12:05,144
Then l don't have anything to say too.

2194
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:07,614
Isn't this case to defame, Anamika, isn't it?

2195
02:12:07,819 --> 02:12:09,684
Anamika, isn't your aunt's daughter, go.

2196
02:12:09,888 --> 02:12:11,856
Didn't you go to honeymoon
after marriage?

2197
02:12:12,057 --> 02:12:13,957
lf so then it would have been easy to prove.

2198
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:15,183
l will prove it, man.

2199
02:12:16,028 --> 02:12:17,689
Leave it man.

2200
02:12:19,331 --> 02:12:21,799
You wait there. when the case is
called you can come.

2201
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:28,233
You have again come to
disturb her, isn't it?

2202
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:33,901
You must withdraw the case and leave
or eIse l will make mess of you.

2203
02:12:34,112 --> 02:12:35,841
Hey sir, don't go.
Just one minute for me sir.

2204
02:12:36,048 --> 02:12:38,016
Please, come. For my sake, come.

2205
02:12:39,051 --> 02:12:40,177
what a big commotion is this?

2206
02:12:40,385 --> 02:12:43,718
Can't you allow the cinema people
to get divorce peacefully?

2207
02:12:45,057 --> 02:12:48,049
Sir, may l make a humble
submission sir?

2208
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:48,885
Yes.

2209
02:12:49,094 --> 02:12:52,723
l am the petitioner in the
case no. 812/2010, sir.

2210
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:56,094
lf l don't withdraw this case l will be put
in the lock up and hang me there.

2211
02:12:56,301 --> 02:12:58,826
That is the threat l just received from
this inspector standing here.

2212
02:13:01,373 --> 02:13:02,237
Come here.

2213
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:05,206
Show the power of Khaki in the station.

2214
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:07,173
Not in the court.
Understood?

2215
02:13:07,379 --> 02:13:08,004
Yes sir.

2216
02:13:08,213 --> 02:13:12,240
Mr. Krishnakumar, this court is
for solving the case.

2217
02:13:12,451 --> 02:13:14,749
Explain to your client not to threaten
or scare anyone.

2218
02:13:14,953 --> 02:13:16,682
lf l joke you don't understand?

2219
02:13:16,888 --> 02:13:19,755
Only now l understand that it
was a joke brother.

2220
02:13:20,025 --> 02:13:21,253
My lord,

2221
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:23,121
first of all my humble submission is

2222
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:27,992
this is a concocted case filed with an ulterior
motive to defame the respondent.

2223
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,497
we have read in the newspapers

2224
02:13:29,701 --> 02:13:32,135
about the women who become famous
are faced with such cases.

2225
02:13:32,337 --> 02:13:35,306
ln near past even against such a dispute
came up against Sania Mirza.

2226
02:13:35,507 --> 02:13:37,600
ln most of such cases
one thing is clear..

2227
02:13:37,809 --> 02:13:42,940
all the complainants were all mentally
affected people who were after cheap publicity.

2228
02:13:45,851 --> 02:13:47,045
Objection, your honour.

2229
02:13:47,252 --> 02:13:50,983
That statement is defamatory.
Defamatory.

2230
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:53,453
He is inferring that petitioner is mad.

2231
02:13:53,658 --> 02:13:57,389
lncluding the marriage photos and
other evidences are.. ..are ..are

2232
02:13:57,596 --> 02:13:59,257
Produced in the court.
- Yes.

2233
02:13:59,464 --> 02:14:02,126
Before taking the evidence please
don't allow such submissions.

2234
02:14:02,334 --> 02:14:05,064
Okay, okay. Don't get emotional.

2235
02:14:05,604 --> 02:14:09,040
Mr. Krishnakumar, whatever you
said isn't relevant in this case.

2236
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:12,142
lf you want you can file another
case for defamation.

2237
02:14:12,344 --> 02:14:13,902
Yes. Oh!

2238
02:14:14,513 --> 02:14:16,947
what a stupid man.
l will give him good fees.

2239
02:14:17,149 --> 02:14:18,912
Hey, don't pay him a single pie.

2240
02:14:19,351 --> 02:14:21,876
He shows such stupidity
and wants fees too?

2241
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:23,084
Saying he is a lawyer..

2242
02:14:23,288 --> 02:14:24,983
what is it?
- Nothing.

2243
02:14:25,357 --> 02:14:26,756
M. Balchandran.

2244
02:14:34,499 --> 02:14:39,402
There is case running that you owe Rs. 600000
to a person name Kundakkadan wareed.

2245
02:14:39,604 --> 02:14:40,468
Is it true?

2246
02:14:40,672 --> 02:14:43,436
Not only to wareed,
l have to repay many people.

2247
02:14:43,642 --> 02:14:46,110
Great, a good thing to be proud of.

2248
02:14:47,212 --> 02:14:47,906
Silence.

2249
02:14:48,113 --> 02:14:51,082
wareed, had come to the location
to take money from you.

2250
02:14:51,283 --> 02:14:52,272
Yes, he had come.

2251
02:14:52,484 --> 02:14:56,284
when wareed had come you were working
as a make-up man for Anamika.

2252
02:14:56,488 --> 02:14:57,182
Yes sir.

2253
02:14:57,389 --> 02:15:02,452
After how long wareed came to the location
from the date you said the marriage took place.

2254
02:15:02,661 --> 02:15:04,856
About a month and half later.

2255
02:15:05,063 --> 02:15:09,830
That time you told, wareed that you
were going to marry Anamika.

2256
02:15:10,035 --> 02:15:12,299
Not that marriage was over.
Is it true?

2257
02:15:12,504 --> 02:15:14,938
No. because l was in a situation where
l could not openly say that in public.

2258
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:16,300
Say yes or no.

2259
02:15:16,875 --> 02:15:18,103
Yes.

2260
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:21,370
This is your handwriting, isn't it?
- Yes.

2261
02:15:21,713 --> 02:15:23,146
This is a paper in which you have declared..

2262
02:15:23,348 --> 02:15:26,511
That you don't have any relationship
with Anamika and have signed it.

2263
02:15:26,718 --> 02:15:28,379
No but on that day the police..

2264
02:15:28,587 --> 02:15:32,148
Balachandran who had made a permanent
habit of borrowing in the name of Anamika..

2265
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:35,518
..and when he was caught in the case of
wareed he was afraid it would become a news

2266
02:15:35,694 --> 02:15:36,991
..and he himself wrote this note
in his own hand and signed it.

2267
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:41,097
This one document is enough to prove that
the argument of the petitioner is fully faIse.

2268
02:15:44,669 --> 02:15:46,261
l wasn't afraid that it would
become a news.

2269
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:50,567
lt was Surya's..
no it was Anamika's fear.

2270
02:15:52,444 --> 02:15:55,880
My lord, this is a paper written under threat
and signed at the police station.

2271
02:15:56,081 --> 02:15:57,742
l have witnesses to prove that.

2272
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:03,986
Hey you put me in trouble
and want to go?

2273
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:05,622
Don't go like that, sit there.

2274
02:16:05,824 --> 02:16:07,917
l have stopped acting. Sit there.

2275
02:16:09,995 --> 02:16:13,089
James. Have you acted in films?

2276
02:16:13,298 --> 02:16:13,821
Yes.

2277
02:16:14,032 --> 02:16:15,693
He had said he was an inspector.

2278
02:16:15,901 --> 02:16:18,267
He does both sir. Two in one.

2279
02:16:19,237 --> 02:16:24,106
Did you act in director Sidharth's films?

2280
02:16:24,309 --> 02:16:26,038
Yes, l have.
- what is you have?

2281
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:27,503
Leave that.

2282
02:16:27,712 --> 02:16:32,308
On whose say so did you make Balachandran
to write such a paper and give you?

2283
02:16:32,517 --> 02:16:33,950
On Sidharth's say so.

2284
02:16:34,586 --> 02:16:35,883
He said that when he told Anamika..

2285
02:16:36,087 --> 02:16:38,248
..she was afraid that this would
become a news and hence..

2286
02:16:38,456 --> 02:16:40,014
..l should get such a letter
in writing from him.

2287
02:16:40,225 --> 02:16:41,624
lt was director Sidharth who told me this.

2288
02:16:46,998 --> 02:16:48,556
when he said that you must
write this and give..

2289
02:16:48,767 --> 02:16:50,598
..what was Balachandran's reaction?

2290
02:16:50,802 --> 02:16:51,769
He didn't say anything special.

2291
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:54,632
Then when he was writing it
his eyes had welled up.

2292
02:16:59,010 --> 02:17:01,410
Did Sidharth sir say anything eIse?

2293
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:05,076
He had said he would give a role
of commissioner in his next film.

2294
02:17:06,351 --> 02:17:08,911
Poomuttrathy Kunjunna Nair's son Sidharth.

2295
02:17:10,822 --> 02:17:13,484
Have you married?
- No.

2296
02:17:14,159 --> 02:17:15,091
How old are you now?

2297
02:17:15,293 --> 02:17:16,317
lrrelevant question my lord.

2298
02:17:16,528 --> 02:17:17,722
Questions not connected.

2299
02:17:17,929 --> 02:17:19,863
Connections will be shown later.

2300
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:21,896
Question may be allowed your honour.

2301
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:23,658
Yes, allowed.

2302
02:17:23,868 --> 02:17:24,835
Age.
- what?

2303
02:17:25,036 --> 02:17:26,628
Age.
- 39.

2304
02:17:26,838 --> 02:17:29,170
why didn't you marry till now?

2305
02:17:29,374 --> 02:17:31,808
Do you have any problem?
- lndecent question mylord.

2306
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:34,001
My friend may be instructed
to keep the decorum of the court.

2307
02:17:34,212 --> 02:17:37,079
My intention was if there was
any love affair etc.

2308
02:17:37,282 --> 02:17:38,214
And not the other thing.

2309
02:17:42,654 --> 02:17:46,988
ln night times haven't you seen Balu,
in Anamika's room?

2310
02:17:47,492 --> 02:17:50,188
Now when he is her personal make-up man
- Have you seen him or not?

2311
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:51,220
l have seen.

2312
02:17:51,429 --> 02:17:58,631
Another night didn't you take Balu's shirt
which was lying in Anamika's room?

2313
02:17:58,937 --> 02:18:00,063
Answer the question.
- No..

2314
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:04,140
why were you often going into
Anamika's room every night?

2315
02:18:06,678 --> 02:18:08,236
what all things he is asking him?

2316
02:18:08,446 --> 02:18:09,413
Objection, My lord.

2317
02:18:09,781 --> 02:18:12,306
These questions are to defame
the character of Anamika.

2318
02:18:12,517 --> 02:18:13,643
This question may not be allowed.

2319
02:18:13,852 --> 02:18:19,484
No, your honour even the petitioner doesn't
have any doubt on Anamika's character.

2320
02:18:19,691 --> 02:18:22,819
The witness's character is
in question here.

2321
02:18:26,298 --> 02:18:30,029
Did Balachandran ever tell you
that Anamika is his wife?

2322
02:18:30,302 --> 02:18:33,897
He has. But at that time itself
Anamika had refused it aIso.

2323
02:18:34,205 --> 02:18:39,268
Did you tell anyone that you were going
to marry Anamika and not Balachandran?

2324
02:18:40,378 --> 02:18:43,506
Did you? - No. l haven't told like
that to any one.

2325
02:18:43,715 --> 02:18:46,946
My God! He did say,
this man told me so.

2326
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:53,286
Mr. say that when you are asked.
- Okay

2327
02:18:57,329 --> 02:19:01,857
wareed who had come to see, Anamika if l
say that you said so, do you object to it?

2328
02:19:02,067 --> 02:19:04,535
wareed? l don't know such
a person aIso.

2329
02:19:04,736 --> 02:19:06,704
Oh God, he is lying again.
- Mister...

2330
02:19:06,905 --> 02:19:08,702
l remember. l will answer when asked.

2331
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:13,475
why did you tell the Sl to take in
writing from Balachandran..

2332
02:19:13,578 --> 02:19:15,045
that he doesn't have relationship?

2333
02:19:15,246 --> 02:19:19,046
My intention was only to protect Anamika
from person who is troubling her.

2334
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:22,708
Did Anamika, know that you were going
to take such a thing in writing?

2335
02:19:23,254 --> 02:19:24,050
No.

2336
02:19:28,893 --> 02:19:30,383
That is all your honour.

2337
02:19:31,696 --> 02:19:36,895
Do you know anything that made you believe
that Balachandran & Anamika were married?

2338
02:19:37,102 --> 02:19:37,898
No.

2339
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:42,729
My lord the issue in this case is
whether the marriage took place.

2340
02:19:42,941 --> 02:19:45,569
My friend is trying to prove
something eIse.

2341
02:19:45,777 --> 02:19:46,903
No more questions.

2342
02:19:47,112 --> 02:19:50,570
Kaundakkaran wareed.
Kaundakkaran wareed.

2343
02:19:50,982 --> 02:19:52,916
who is that?
- Kaundakkaran wareed.

2344
02:19:55,553 --> 02:19:57,248
Oh! Ask. Ask. Ask quickly.
- Hey..

2345
02:19:57,455 --> 02:19:59,650
Court, only if l am asked l can
say what l want to say.

2346
02:19:59,858 --> 02:20:02,418
Do you lend money on interest?

2347
02:20:02,627 --> 02:20:05,596
Oh my lawyer, ask me about
the lies that the director told.

2348
02:20:05,797 --> 02:20:07,264
Just answer the question
you are asked.

2349
02:20:07,465 --> 02:20:11,993
Oh my God, yes l do lend money on
interest but none of them return it back.

2350
02:20:12,203 --> 02:20:15,468
lt is true, if you have any doubt
ask him.. no Him.

2351
02:20:16,808 --> 02:20:20,608
Did anyone eIse say that they will give
the money that Balachandran owes you?

2352
02:20:20,812 --> 02:20:23,781
Yes. The madam sitting there,
Amaish that Amanika said so.

2353
02:20:23,982 --> 02:20:25,108
They are going to get married.

2354
02:20:25,316 --> 02:20:27,113
They said they would give my money
after the shooting is over.

2355
02:20:27,318 --> 02:20:28,285
Then there was no further action.

2356
02:20:28,486 --> 02:20:31,284
when l went again to ask,
that director held my hand..

2357
02:20:31,489 --> 02:20:32,956
..twisted it and said that he is
going to marry, Anamika.

2358
02:20:33,158 --> 02:20:35,388
He said that he doesn't know me.
lt was a lie.

2359
02:20:35,593 --> 02:20:38,118
He had called me brother-in-law.
l too had called him brother-in-law.

2360
02:20:38,329 --> 02:20:41,298
Sir, whoever gives l don't mind.
l don't want interest.

2361
02:20:41,499 --> 02:20:43,967
lf l get my principle it is enough for me.
The court should tell him to pay back my loan.

2362
02:20:44,169 --> 02:20:47,138
Hey Mr. this court is not for
getting your money back.

2363
02:20:47,338 --> 02:20:50,967
That is great. Then so long for
what was l here for shaving?

2364
02:20:51,176 --> 02:20:52,643
Hey Mr. contempt of court.

2365
02:20:52,844 --> 02:20:57,304
You perjured and dishonoured the
court hence you are fined Rs.1000.

2366
02:20:57,849 --> 02:21:02,809
My God, what lie did l tell you?
Removing hair means haircutting.

2367
02:21:03,354 --> 02:21:05,822
lf you open your mouth again the
fine won't stop at Rs.1000

2368
02:21:13,031 --> 02:21:13,827
Brother..

2369
02:21:14,933 --> 02:21:18,494
Your balance has increased
by 1 1 12 along with the interest.

2370
02:21:21,773 --> 02:21:25,834
This is the copy of petition which
the company made against madam.

2371
02:21:26,044 --> 02:21:29,172
lf you get emotional and tell the truth
then we will have to file this.

2372
02:21:33,251 --> 02:21:36,414
Daughter these villains will
be after our blood.

2373
02:21:37,255 --> 02:21:40,588
For now you have no other option.
- Surya alias Anamika.

2374
02:21:43,728 --> 02:21:53,694
Central

2375
02:22:01,579 --> 02:22:04,548
Do you know the petitioner
Balachandran in this case?- Yes.

2376
02:22:04,749 --> 02:22:05,807
How do you know him?

2377
02:22:07,085 --> 02:22:11,613
He was my make-up man for some time.

2378
02:22:28,606 --> 02:22:32,235
Since when did Balachandran
began as your make-up man?

2379
02:22:35,346 --> 02:22:39,908
Anamika since when Balachandran
start his work as your make-up man?

2380
02:22:45,023 --> 02:22:49,255
Anamika..Did you hear the question?
- Huh, sorry sir...

2381
02:22:59,304 --> 02:23:03,604
Since when did petitioner Balachandran
began as your make-up man?

2382
02:23:07,612 --> 02:23:11,343
The next day after Balu tied
the holy thread on my neck.

2383
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:30,467
Anamika what is..

2384
02:23:30,668 --> 02:23:33,296
Mr. Krishnakumar the court
had asked the question.

2385
02:23:33,938 --> 02:23:38,966
Just as shown in this photo do you agree
that you were married to the petitioner?

2386
02:23:39,177 --> 02:23:39,802
Yes.

2387
02:23:40,011 --> 02:23:42,479
But, in the proof of this case
you have filed

2388
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:45,148
it is stated that the marriage
had not taken place.

2389
02:23:45,650 --> 02:23:49,677
For having faIse information to the court
a case of perjury may be filed against you.

2390
02:23:50,421 --> 02:23:54,152
Do you know, there is a punishment of
three years imprisonment for that crime.

2391
02:23:57,528 --> 02:24:01,988
Mr. Krishnan, l don't have any other option.
l am going to take action against her.

2392
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:07,832
However big a star she may
be a crime is a crime.

2393
02:24:08,106 --> 02:24:10,666
l am resigning from this case
as the defence counsel.

2394
02:24:23,321 --> 02:24:28,281
Tell him that l am withdrawing
my case. Tell him man.

2395
02:24:31,396 --> 02:24:34,695
what is it, Mathai? Now only Mathai
is left to go from this case.

2396
02:24:34,899 --> 02:24:37,868
No, your honour. The petitioner is
withdrawing from this case.

2397
02:24:38,069 --> 02:24:41,197
Please, don't initiate proceedings
against the defence.

2398
02:24:41,406 --> 02:24:43,966
l see, one lawyer for both
prosecution and defence?

2399
02:24:44,175 --> 02:24:48,874
Your honour, all this was a misunderstanding.
lt was here that got cleared.

2400
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:50,604
was it to correct their
misunderstanding

2401
02:24:50,815 --> 02:24:54,376
you wasted the valuable time of the court?
You can withdraw the case.

2402
02:24:54,585 --> 02:24:58,214
But l will initiate the criminal action
against her for perjury.

2403
02:25:00,358 --> 02:25:02,883
Your honour doesn't a husband and wife

2404
02:25:03,094 --> 02:25:05,460
have any right to have any
misunderstanding in married life?

2405
02:25:08,032 --> 02:25:11,729
Your honour both of them
don't want to separate.

2406
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:14,803
lf the court is adamant to
separate them then

2407
02:25:15,006 --> 02:25:17,907
Separate them. Only my counselling
is there isn't it?

2408
02:25:18,176 --> 02:25:20,406
l will resign from that.

2409
02:25:33,958 --> 02:25:34,925
Thank you your honour.

2410
02:25:37,628 --> 02:25:40,256
Don't say anything. lt is you who
made this so complicated.

2411
02:25:42,133 --> 02:25:45,364
Hey foolish director, the bomb without
any gunpowder was the compensation,

2412
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:48,471
has brought it to this extent isn't it?

2413
02:25:49,807 --> 02:25:53,971
with that my channel and film
got a lot of mileage.

2414
02:25:55,313 --> 02:25:59,113
You just leave it.
Can't you get any other women to marry?

2415
02:26:04,822 --> 02:26:05,686
Sir, will she continue acting?

2416
02:26:05,923 --> 02:26:07,948
No. if she stops acting you
won't see any cinema?

2417
02:26:08,159 --> 02:26:11,128
lt will be the honeymoon.
- why bring the court even over there?

2418
02:26:11,329 --> 02:26:13,126
Now will you marry as per
tradition and law?

2419
02:26:13,331 --> 02:26:15,959
why man? Don't you have marriage
and such things in your house?

2420
02:26:16,167 --> 02:26:18,863
Hey, quotation, start the car
they are going.

2421
02:26:21,172 --> 02:26:23,663
where to now?
- Ah!

2422
02:26:24,108 --> 02:26:25,632
Oh God!

2423
02:26:33,951 --> 02:26:35,885
Hey man just for Rs. 600000

2424
02:26:36,087 --> 02:26:38,419
you gave me trouble worth more
than Rs. 6 million.

2425
02:26:38,623 --> 02:26:40,853
l don't have the heart to return
your money.

2426
02:26:42,927 --> 02:26:45,760
l am going to make a film.
Anamika is the heroine in it.

2427
02:26:45,963 --> 02:26:48,727
who is the hero, sir?
- l will decide that at my will.

2428
02:26:49,634 --> 02:26:52,865
Now take the advance auspiciously.
Here is Rs. 600000.

2429
02:26:53,037 --> 02:26:56,006
Take it.
- No. l won't act from now.

2430
02:26:56,707 --> 02:26:59,835
l don't want anything that Balu doesn't like.

2431
02:27:00,378 --> 02:27:04,280
who told you that l don't like it?
Acting is your profession isn't it?

2432
02:27:04,549 --> 02:27:07,677
The profession that you like.
l won't object to that at all.

2433
02:27:07,885 --> 02:27:10,513
Oh God, l got saved.
Then there is no other obstacles isn't it?

2434
02:27:10,721 --> 02:27:11,847
Here take hold of it. Take it.

2435
02:27:17,061 --> 02:27:19,689
The account between us over with this.
Then we will see at the shooting spot.

2436
02:27:20,231 --> 02:27:20,856
Then wareed sir,

2437
02:27:21,065 --> 02:27:23,533
shouldn't we sit and decide about
the shooting location and the cast?

2438
02:27:23,734 --> 02:27:25,361
All that this production controller
will decide.

2439
02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:27,037
Then l am not the production controller?
- No.

2440
02:27:27,305 --> 02:27:31,639
Hello, the make-up man did not
get the advance.

2441
02:27:34,245 --> 02:27:37,612
Here. There is Rs.10000 in this.
A little more, yet you can keep it.

2442
02:27:38,249 --> 02:27:39,648
See you, Amanika.

2443
02:27:40,918 --> 02:27:42,044
Yes, Madam.
