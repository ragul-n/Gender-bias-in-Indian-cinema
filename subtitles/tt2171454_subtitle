00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,764
Master, Fauj isn't here,'

536
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:55,807
Don't take h s name,'

537
00:35:57,045 --> 00:36:00,173
Yes, They did ment on
the Master's name,,

538
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:06,477
By the way, only Satbeer's
called master in this village,

539
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,049
The dog,,

540
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:11,449
Come on, start the car,

541
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:12,617
Think before you leap,

Come along if you want to, or get ost,
- Fine, et's go,

Have you lost your m nd?

544
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:38,181
Master's the one who's gone crazy,

545
00:36:38,453 --> 00:36:42,890
How dare he attack my house!
- No, no,

546
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:44,921
Master cannot be behind this,

547
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:46,660
You're surely mistaken, Fauji,,

548
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:47,819
Let's sit and talk,

And on y Satbeer's ca ed master,

a respected man like master

And you know Fauj 's

Son, Fauji's your fr end,,

580

You can convince him,

00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:22,954
Why wil Satbeer do this with h m?

so, there's noth ng
to be afraid of,

Mother, listen to me,,

l didn't know you're
so scared of that Fauj ?

624
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:25,106
lt's your temper that scares me,
not him,

625
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:29,779
For my sake,
you won't step out unt l say so,,

626
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:32,517
That's not fa r, mother,,

You always bound me w th your oaths,,

00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:35,320
Brother, sten to what mother says,

l just don't get t,

630
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,324
Do we need that cha rman's
order to take revenge?

631
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,099
Let's wait unt tomorrow,

632
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:49,361
Otherwise, the chairman w say,,,

00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:51,199
that Fauj didn't respect his word,,

634
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:53,269
Try to understand,
- F ne,,

635
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:56,601
L sten to that chairman,

636
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:58,808
He says Stand up and you stand up,

00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:01,605
He says S t down and you sit down,;

638
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:05,046
Today that master
has spread his wings,

639
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:07,180
Tomorrow, it' be someone else,,

640
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:09,454
Mah ndri's absolutely r ght, brother,,

That master,
how did he grow so courageous?

643
00:41:16,798 --> 00:41:18,629
No need to think too much,

644
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:21,861
Let's kill him today,,,

he would've spoken to you about it,,

649
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:33,874
The longer you take,

What's he do ng here?

686
00:43:56,424 --> 00:43:57,755
Rashid's with me,,

687
00:43:58,626 --> 00:44:02,392
And, l don't th nk h s
presence should bother anyone,

688
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:06,397
So, Chairman, got your answer?

689
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:08,328
Go ahead, council, Start,

690
00:44:09,437 --> 00:44:11,905
Fauj , What's a this?,

691
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,109
We're a unhappy about
the attack on your house,,

692
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:18,344
But, you just can't
accuse anyone for it,,

693
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,842
And a man ike Satbeer,

694
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:21,445
You should be ashamed?

695
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:23,480
Why shou d l be the on y one?

696
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:28,716
And, l know what
the Master's thinking,

697
00:44:30,058 --> 00:44:31,889
Pardon me,
but l'd like to say someth ng

698
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,991
You won't say a word,,

699
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:34,992
You can do what you like,
but l will speak today,,

700
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:37,921
Are you ca ing Mahindr a liar?

701
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:42,099
She heard her attackers
take master's name,

702
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:44,068
And et me tell you the truth,,

703
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:47,167
Master has h s eyes on
brother-in-law's property,,

704
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,101
And, it wasn't possible
without getting rid of Fauji,,

705
00:44:51,346 --> 00:44:54,008
So he thought, Let's kill Fauji,,

706
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,776
and take over the property,

707
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:57,951
Rasca , don't try to teach me,

01:00:08,862 --> 01:00:11,023
Patience has crossed all im ts,

891
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:15,999
He's forsaken the pen and paper,

892
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,568
And now he' let
h s f st do the ta king,

893
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:24,039
Even if the snakes
are h d ng n the r burrow,

894
01:00:25,212 --> 01:00:26,372
Enem es tremble,

895
01:00:26,513 --> 01:00:27,445
Their breath shivers,

896
01:00:27,548 --> 01:00:30,847
They beg for their lives,

897
01:00:41,595 --> 01:00:47,192
Forsaking stud es,
he's out to wage war,

898

Forsaking stud es,

Roars, snarls,
but can't be over-powered,

901
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:06,784
The lion's out of the cage,

01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,912
Now sten to h m roar,

By hook or by crook,

But there's a strange
heat n the air here,'

,,but here,

There are just two p ayers

wh e the other's
running into bad uck,

971

Fauj , We'll have to
br ng that swine down,,,,

990

That Khalnayak movie spoiled all

They were teasing the g rls

Hello, Mr, Thakur,,

1315
01:33:34,232 --> 01:33:35,062
Satbeer,

01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,030

1317
01:33:36,101 --> 01:33:36,863
Come, sit,

01:33:43,008 --> 01:33:44,703
l'm not that popu ar yet,

1319
01:33:45,177 --> 01:33:46,872
There's a reward of one million
on your head,

1320
01:33:50,048 --> 01:33:52,243
What f l k l you now?

1321
01:33:53,885 --> 01:33:56,683
l've heard that Thakur's are
men of honour,,

1322
01:33:57,189 --> 01:33:58,121
Hey,,

1323
01:33:58,356 --> 01:33:59,948
Get tea for us,
- Yes, sir,,

1324
01:34:05,697 --> 01:34:10,157
You're daring,
- l'm sure you didn't ca me for just that,

1325
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:15,133
Thank you,

1326
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:28,044

l want him too,

1328
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,991
But, how can l help you?

1329
01:34:39,464 --> 01:34:40,988
You must have heard,

1330
01:34:42,601 --> 01:34:44,432
B rds of a feather
flock together,,

1331
01:34:46,505 --> 01:34:48,029
There's not much of a difference between you
two,,

1332
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,465
Then you must have offered
th s deal to Fauj as we ,

1333
01:34:52,644 --> 01:34:55,340
So? What went wrong?

1334
01:34:56,681 --> 01:34:59,172
l've done enough R&D on
you two,

1335
01:34:59,951 --> 01:35:01,418
There's something about you,,

1336
01:35:04,923 --> 01:35:08,757
When two hunters join hands,
the hunt becomes interest ng,

1337
01:35:10,962 --> 01:35:12,122
lt's ke this, Mr, Thakur,,

1338
01:35:13,465 --> 01:35:14,989
There's a saying in
my village,,

1339
01:35:16,868 --> 01:35:20,497
lt's not advisable to make fr ends
or enem es w th the police,

1340
01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:23,998
Can't say about enm ty,,,

1341
01:35:24,309 --> 01:35:27,938
but, only a chosen few get
to be Pritam Singh's fr end,

1342
01:35:32,851 --> 01:35:33,943
Come on,,

1343

our first meeting,,

1344

What happened, Fauji?

1348
01:35:51,636 --> 01:35:53,570
l haven't heard a gunshot
in two days,,

1349
01:35:54,072 --> 01:35:55,266
l can't sleep,,

1350
01:35:57,676 --> 01:35:58,700
Who k ed him?

1351
01:36:48,593 --> 01:36:49,355
Rasca ,,

1352
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:50,155
Let's get out of here,,

1353
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:52,563
Master s w th police,,

1354
01:36:59,738 --> 01:37:00,534
Look,

1355
01:37:01,806 --> 01:37:05,105
Let's see how ong can
Fauj run?

1356
01:37:14,386 --> 01:37:15,216

1357

Fauj , So?,

1359
01:37:25,897 --> 01:37:27,262
No more guts, Poo!

1360
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,898
He took Rastog! D dn't he?!

1361
01:37:33,338 --> 01:37:35,135
l suggest that you take
ret rement,

1362
01:37:35,407 --> 01:37:36,738
Get out of here, Go!

1363
01:37:36,941 --> 01:37:37,873
You've become a burden,

1364
01:37:38,943 --> 01:37:40,934
l asked you to keep h m in
the farmhouse,,,,

1365
01:37:41,079 --> 01:37:42,205
but you were scared-st ff,

1366
01:37:42,514 --> 01:37:43,674
Four of my men were k ed,,

1367
01:37:43,815 --> 01:37:44,782
Get lost!

1368
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,276
Fauj! Fauj! !

1369
01:37:46,484 --> 01:37:47,746
Tell him to speak to me,,,

1370
01:37:47,852 --> 01:37:49,149
on y when he's in his senses,,

1371
01:37:49,521 --> 01:37:50,351
Come on!

1372
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:53,250
He's gone ma! !

1373
01:37:54,092 --> 01:37:55,252
He's lost h s m n! !

1374
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:58,954
Pr tam Singh knew
where my h deout s,,

1375
01:37:59,364 --> 01:38:01,127
lf he had conducted a ra d,,,

1376
01:38:01,266 --> 01:38:05,396
then l could've never fought
the elect ons in Ghaziabad,,,

1377
01:38:06,671 --> 01:38:10,437
Rashid, Don't make th ngs worse,

1378
01:38:11,676 --> 01:38:13,166
We need th s brute,

1379
01:38:15,814 --> 01:38:18,806
You need to make fr ends,
not enem es,,

1380
01:38:19,217 --> 01:38:20,184
E ections are round the corner,

1381
01:38:20,785 --> 01:38:22,980
Just focus on the nom nat ons,
that's all,,

1382
01:38:24,522 --> 01:38:26,854
We' handle Pritam S ngh ater,

1383
01:38:36,401 --> 01:38:37,527
Narender,
- Yes, s r,

1384
01:38:37,669 --> 01:38:40,137
File an FlR against
Rashid and Fauji,,,

1385
01:38:42,073 --> 01:38:43,005
Behalf of Rastogi,,

1386
01:38:43,174 --> 01:38:45,506
S r, Let the FlR be,

1387
01:38:46,044 --> 01:38:47,136
Don't drag me in th s mess,

1388
01:38:48,713 --> 01:38:50,704
lt' anger Fauj ,,

1389
01:38:54,652 --> 01:38:58,611
lf you don't lodge an FlR,
then t'll make me angry,

1390
01:38:59,991 --> 01:39:02,858
And you can even lose your fe,,

1391
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,964
And, the report won't be odged
in any police stat on,

1392
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:10,693
Get that,,

1393
01:39:11,069 --> 01:39:12,366
That's unfair,

1394
01:39:25,683 --> 01:39:27,173
He wouldn't utter a word,,

1395
01:39:28,953 --> 01:39:31,581
But now, the rascal speaks
in a h gh-tone,,

1396
01:39:39,898 --> 01:39:43,265
Why do l come to you whenever
l'm worried?

1397
01:39:45,937 --> 01:39:47,734
Why do l find peace on y
when l'm w th you?

1398
01:39:53,244 --> 01:39:55,610
Because you ove me,,

1399
01:40:16,334 --> 01:40:18,302
He o,

02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:43,049
by dreaming about Rash d's death,

1768
02:11:43,886 --> 02:11:47,913
Fauj ,,,po tics is a d fferent game,,,

1769
02:11:48,624 --> 02:11:49,921
A po t cian and a gangster

You cheated me even
after taking two bill on,,

1775
02:13:45,408 --> 02:13:46,841
You showed the true
colours of the police,

1776
02:13:47,243 --> 02:13:48,767
You'll need a few more lifet mes,,,

1777
02:13:48,911 --> 02:13:50,742
,,,to understand the po ce,

1778
02:13:51,614 --> 02:13:53,479
But any number of
lifet mes aren't enough,,,

1779
02:13:53,616 --> 02:13:55,311
,,,to understand Pritam Singh,

1780
02:13:55,618 --> 02:13:57,586

Gandhij 's first pr nc p e

1784
02:17:47,817 --> 02:17:53,119
What bullets can't achieve,

1785
02:17:53,322 --> 02:17:54,311
Repeat after me,

1786

What bullets can't achieve,
sweet ta ks can!

1787

What bullets can't achieve,
sweet ta ks can!

Why don't you move to De h ?

1789
02:18:13,943 --> 02:18:16,070
Why don't you th nk
about your future?

1790

Here, b g brother,

02:19:01,991 --> 02:19:03,515
And shoot me,,

1796
02:19:16,272 --> 02:19:19,730
lt was against Pr tam Singh's
nature to et any cr mina ve,'

1797
02:19:21,076 --> 02:19:23,271
But, there was something
about Satbeer,,'

1798
02:19:23,412 --> 02:19:24,674
,,that touched my heart,'

1799
02:19:25,147 --> 02:19:27,581
And, for the f rst time,
Pritam S ngh,,'

1800
02:19:27,683 --> 02:19:29,378
,,got someone pun shed lega ly,,'

1801
02:19:29,518 --> 02:19:31,110
,, nstead of punish ng
him n h s sty e,'

1802
02:19:31,453 --> 02:19:35,890
Because, if l had k ed him,
God wou dn't have forgiven me,'

1803
02:19:41,931 --> 02:19:43,057
We're proud of you, Pr tam,
