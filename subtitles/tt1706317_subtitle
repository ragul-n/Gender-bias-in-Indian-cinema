1
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,789
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

2
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:25,004
The jury finds Mr. Aakash
Rana guilty on all accounts.

3
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,369
I just want to present my
side of the story to the court.

4
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,415
His Hindu marriage with British
nationalist Mrs. Nikita Malhotra

5
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:35,853
...is considered illegal
according to the laws of England.

6
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,513
Our marriage is not illegal.

7
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:43,722
The court orders to seize Mr. Aakash
Rana's assets and bank accounts.

8
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,661
But my visa is valid.
And I am married to a British citizen.

9
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,930
After hearing the appeal
of the UK border agency...

10
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:55,906
...the court orders to deport
Mr. Aakash Rana immediately.

11
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,374
We are not criminals.

12
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,503
And bars him from
returning to UK ever again.

13
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,081
See, I am not a criminal.

14
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,381
I want to take my wife along.

15
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,645
I wantjustice.

16
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,029
Hi.

17
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,833
Good to see you, sir.

18
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,307
How are you?

19
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,773
Still alive, sir.

20
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:05,085
But we faced really
terrible days since you left.

21
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,856
Did you get any news?

22
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,063
I've been looking for it
since a long time, sir.

23
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,231
God willing, we'll soon succeed.

24
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:21,965
Taxi!

25
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,307
This is a garage?

26
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,884
A garage of stolen vehicles.

27
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,144
They don't come here to
get repaired, but disappear.

28
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,882
Steal a car from a
posh locality in London.

29
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,250
Remove the parts and sell
them in the gray market.

30
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,887
All in two hours.

31
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,256
Hey.

32
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,194
Hey.
- Jojo.

33
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,164
You?
- Aadil.

34
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,968
Come on.
- Wait here for a moment.

35
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,844
Who is he?
- He's with me.

36
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,880
Do you have the packages?

37
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,025
Show me the money.
- Package first.

38
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,294
Show me the money.

39
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,021
Show me the stuff.

40
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,327
Show me the money.

41
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,268
Show me the stuff.

42
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,311
That's one hell lot of
C4s you got here, boys.

43
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,007
That shit could blow London sky high.

44
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,176
What's the idea?

45
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,718
You'll know soon.

46
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,222
Come on, man. Run.

47
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,716
Run. Run.

48
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,057
Cops. Run.

49
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,195
You brought a cop. - He's not a cop.

50
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,164
Move. Move. Move.

51
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,358
Team One, move in there.

52
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,805
Oh, no.
- My leg.

53
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,170
Let's all go down.

54
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,002
Team One, move.

55
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,839
Team One, move.

56
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,110
Move. Move.

57
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,290
Down!

58
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,423
Move.

59
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,532
Got him.

60
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,864
Move. Move. Watch it. Watch it.

61
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,969
Aadil run.

62
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,125
"Come on, everybody,
do you want to play?"

63
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,134
"Do you want to get hot?
Do you want to get wet?"

64
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,935
"At night if you have...
- Laila. Laila."

65
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,477
"If you have the company of...
- Laila. Laila."

66
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,173
"In your arms just...
- Laila. Laila."

67
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:21,412
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

68
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,282
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

69
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,054
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

70
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,461
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

71
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,362
"I am Laila.
Everybody's beloved Laila."

72
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,991
"Laila. Laila. Laila."

73
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,833
"Laila. Laila. Laila."

74
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,839
"I am Laila.
Everybody's beloved Laila."

75
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,307
"At night if you have...

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,072
"If you have the company of

"I am the talk of the town."

80
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,938
"I rule everyone's
dreams without a crown."

81
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,597
"If you spend a night with me."

82
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,207
"On fire your body will be."

83
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,075
"You'll never be able to forget me."

84
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:27,209
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

85
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,255
"Put up your hand in
the air and say Laila."

86
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,653
"Everybody say La momma Laila."

87
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,051
"She's a Laila."

88
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,252
"Where's a Laila?"

89
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,420
"Come on, my Laila.

90
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:08,058
"Every Friday
I apply kohl in my eyes."

91
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:13,955
"In a party when I look up..."

92
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,363
"Everybody if you see her.

93
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,526
"Tell me what you see."

94
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,694
"I want to shake your body.
Start it again."

95
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:24,102
"Every Friday
I apply kohl in my eyes."

96
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,670
"In a party when I look up..."

97
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,449
"16 to 55, no matter what's the age."

98
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,144
"To get me, everyone
has just one craze."

99
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,721
"Looking at me, hearts
beat faster in rage."

100
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:41,585
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

101
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,694
"Laila. Laila."

102
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,966
"I am Laila.
Everybody's beloved Laila."

103
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,198
"I am Laila. I am Laila."

104
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,332
"I am Laila. I am..."

105
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,740
"At night if you have...

106
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,480
"If you have the company of...

107
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,209
"In your arms just...

108
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:11,189
"I can make Majnu go crazy."

109
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,243
We're closed.
- Steve, they're with me.

110
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,834
So far whatever you
did for was for us.

111
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,638
Now it's our turn.

112
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,613
Nowadays, you don't
get respect easily.

113
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,374
You have to snatch it.

114
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,353
I hope we'll get our
share by tomorrow.

115
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:27,325
He's a combination of a
statesman and a film star.

116
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,323
He's companionate,
enthusiastic, humorous...

117
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,263
...and has a strong
sense of public duty.

118
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,403
That my friends, is Arjun Khanna.

119
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,136
Arjun, I personally feel that
you've decided to retire too early.

120
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,175
It is truly a loss for us, Arjun.

121
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,879
You'll be surely missed
by us and our community.

122
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,848
To Arjun Khanna,
policeman extraordinaire.

123
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,182
Thank you.

124
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,411
Thank you, Levi.

125
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,815
Thank you for saying such
wonderful things about me.

126
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,448
Now, can I have a copy of
the speech, for my in-laws?

127
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,219
In my entire life,
I've realized that...

128
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,855
...there are three things
you should never try to do.

129
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,293
First, never try to kiss a
girl leaning away from you.

130
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,895
Second, never climb a
friend leaning towards you.

131
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,608
And third, never try to keep
such a wonderful gathering...

132
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,271
...away from drinks and fine dine.

133
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,842
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in my memories.

134
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,243
Let's party.

135
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,878
Yeah!

136
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,281
Packed your books?
- Yes.

137
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,510
All of them?
- Yes, of course.

138
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,347
Packed your lunch?
- Yes, Daddy.

139
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,921
Make sure you have it.
Did you call your mother? - Yes.

140
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,650
You told her what time
she has to pick you up?

141
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,918
Yes, I did.
- Where is the ticket?

142
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,659
Daddy, don't worry.
I'm a big girl now.

143
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,786
I am all grown up now.

144
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,387
Okay.

145
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,244
Okay, big girl,
I've a surprise for you.

146
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,545
Surprise?

147
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,250
Wow

148
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,789
A new cell phone. Thank you, Daddy.

149
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,383
Here's the charger.
- Thank you.

150
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,320
I have added all the contacts.

151
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,893
Just in case. Okay?

152
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,265
Bye, Daddy.

153
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,407
I love you.
- I love you, too.

154
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,440
Go. Go. Go.
- Bye. Yeah.

155
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,754
If you could tell Suzan to
mail final presentations, too.

156
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,394
Come on.

157
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,599
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

158
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,401
This is your co-driver, Sean Sadler...

159
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,636
...welcoming you to
112 Virgin Train service.

00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,802

161
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:07,970

163
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:16,980

00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,579
Good morning, sir.

165
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,051
Morning.

166
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,051
Morning, Leno.

167
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,359
The forces tell me it's time
for me to go home to sleep.

168
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,693
Any updates? - I had a problem
on a train that had stalled...

169
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,132
...under Southampton country line.

170
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,496
I had to diverse some
passengers via Northampton.

171
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,818
Good morning,
Railway control security.

172
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,051
May I help you, please?

173
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,857
Just a moment.

174
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,021
Hello, this is the Railway
Security Chief speaking.

175
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,890
Hello.

176
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,161
There's a bomb on London-Glasgow 112.

177
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,166
If the speed drops
below 60 the bomb explodes.

178
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,906
Do not stop the train.

179
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,938
Do not stop the train.

180
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,779
Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?

181
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,477
You are needed inside, urgently.

182
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,416
Hi, guys.
- Good morning.

183
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,117
Hello, sir.
- Hey, Radhika.

184
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,718
How is your cold?
- Absolutely fine, sir.

185
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,057
We've a situation.

186
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,799
Good morning,
gentlemen. So, what's happened?

187
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,972
There's a bomb threat.
- Trigger station?

188
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,597
London-Glasgow. Train 112.

189
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,034
Did you say the
London-Glasgow express?

190
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,640
Radhika, there's a bomb threat on 112.

191
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,080
The bomb can explode if
its speed goes below 60.

192
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,448
Perhaps someone is playing a prank.
But I'm not taking any chances

193
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,747
What?

194
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,690
Okay, listen up, everyone. Guys.

195
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,892
Guys. Guys. Come on, listen up.

196
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,028
There's a bomb threat on
London-Glasgow Express, No. 112.

197
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,130
I want each and every
one of you to concentrate.

198
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,224
Radhika, keep the track of 112 clear.
- Yes.

199
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,696
John, get me the driver on the line.

200
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,828
Sir. You're needed inside, urgently.

201
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,837
I told you there's a
bomb on the train.

202
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,135
If you think it's a hoax then...

203
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,970
You...

204
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,506
Give me the phone.

205
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,510
Hello. Hello.

206
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,515
Just rewind. Quickly.

207
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,079
Stop. Play.
- 'It's a hoax then... '

208
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,618
'You... '

209
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,953
Hello. He's on line.

210
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,549
Who are you?

211
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,551
I just heard you abuse.

212
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,189
Who are you? What do you want?

213
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,623
Who are you?
- My name is Sanjay Raina.

214
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,226
Railway Traffic Controller.

215
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,026
My name isn't more important
than 500 passengers' lives.

216
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,798
But your good sense
could save their lives.

217
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,098
Hence, listen carefully.

218
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,635
If you this is a hoax then
I have planted a similar bomb...

219
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,578
...on London
Manchester Goods Train 509.

220
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,143
It is currently running
at the speed of 15m/hr.

221
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,743
In a while the train will ascend.

222
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,853
While ascending its
speed will reduce by 5 miles.

223
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,680
And the bomb will explode.

224
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,285
If you want to save the drivers...

225
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,223
...then they should jump off
it before the bomb explodes.

226
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:20,997
Hello.

227
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,639
A bomb. Come on, jump.

228
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,907
All the exchange points
that I am concerned about...

229
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,540
Sir, he hasn't lied.

230
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,220
Goods train just blew off.
There was a bomb on that train.

231
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,549
What about the drivers?

232
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,214
Sir, they jumped off
before the bomb exploded.

233
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,985
But there were minor injuries.

234
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,664
Find out the exact position
and speed of the train. Fast.

235
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,199
And John, I want the
position of all the trains...

236
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,824
...coming in the opposite direction.

237
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,027
Bring it over.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,866
Sir, it has just crossed
Chelsea on the North Line.

239
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,599
And the speed is 90m/hr.

240
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,766
Good. Ask the driver
to maintain the speed...

241
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,141
...and not to reduce it at any cost,
unless I say so. - Sir.

242
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:08,244
John, inform all stations, 112
will not be making scheduled stops.

243
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,650
Okay, sir.

244
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,658
Radhika, check all lines,
crossings and signals.

245
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,785
There shouldn't be any obstructions
on the track. - Right, sir.

246
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,229
Hi, sir. It's Richard speaking.

247
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,061
Sir, I've got the train driver
on the line.

248
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,225
What's his name, John?

249
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,633
Give me the headphones.
- Richard. - Richard.

250
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,173
Sir. - We have reason to believe
there is a bomb on your train.

251
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,702
We have no official confirmation yet.

252
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,209
But we are not taking
any chances, Richard.

253
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,840
Richard. Richard.

254
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,146
Richard, get a hold of yourself
and listen to me very carefully.

255
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,248
What is your speed right now?

256
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,683
110 miles per hour, sir.

257
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,058
We should be reaching our
next station in 20 minutes.

258
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,649
We could stop and do checks there.

259
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,955
No. No. No. No, Richard.
You'll do nothing of that sort.

260
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:55,264
If you reduce your speed to less
than 60m/hr the bomb will go off.

261
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,664
Do you hear me?

262
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,067
Radhika, how long will it take
to reach Glasgow at this speed?

263
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,205
Sir, approximately 10 hours.

264
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,934
Okay, Richard, now concentrate.

265
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,903
You bring your speed down to 70m/hr.

266
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,772
That will make yourjourney
to Glasgow to about 12 hours.

267
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,142
I'll speak to you later.
Wish you luck. - Sanjay.

268
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,306
Sanjay.

269
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,984
This is Sanjay Raina. Our
head traffic controller.

270
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,720
Hello.
- Detective Inspector Alan Fisher.

271
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,021
Senior investigative officer.
- Good morning.

272
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,128
Has the bomber called again?
- No, not yet.

273
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,356
Well, he might. So, we
need to be prepared.

274
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,693
Where's the control room?

275
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,959
It's this way, sir.

276
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,207
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.

277
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,674
Can I have a quiet word?

278
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,378
Sir, we've an emergency situation.

279
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,677
And this is an emergency
joining call for you.

280
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,451
When we go to Jammu
we'll do a lot of shopping.

281
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,852
You two will have to
go to India alone.

282
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,294
Why, is everything fine?

283
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,229
There's an emergency, Alka.

284
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,336
The department has called me
to the office for an urgentjob.

285
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,704
I am sorry, Alka.

286
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,933
I think I will have to
work for another day.

287
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,877
Mamma was right. You can never retire.

288
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,479
Why aren't we stopping?

289
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,252
Are we supposed to be stopping here?

290
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,347
How can this be? My ticket
is valid to this station.

291
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,290
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Where's the train manager?

292
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,991
Excuse me.

293
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,327
Could you tell us what's going on?

294
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,925
Yeah. Why haven't we stopped?

295
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,870
Please, be calm. There
is nothing to worry about.

296
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,734
You sure passed our
station without stopping.

297
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,105
How can you tell me not to worry?

298
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,404
Sir, please. Sit down.
- No. No. No. Shut up

299
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,412
...and tell us what's going on.
- Calm down. Calm down.

300
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,845
Excuse me.

301
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,112
Why didn't he tell
us why didn't he stop?

302
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,177
What's going on?

303
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,256
This is Chief Inspector
Shivan Menon, narcotics branch.

304
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,827
Please open the door.

305
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,772
Is there any problem?

306
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,034
Yes, sir.

307
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,508
The metropolitan police
have confirmed a bomb blast...

308
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,509
...that occurred this
morning on a Northern Railway.

309
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,909
That a Manchester bound
goods train exploded...

310
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,246
...this morning near York.

311
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,878
I am currently standing outside
Platform 10 at Euston station.

312
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,422
That a similar bomb
has been placed on...

313
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,459
...the London-Glasgow train
112 that left this morning

314
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,552
Police suspect this is
where the bomb was planted.

315
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,232
Sir, is there some sort of crisis?

316
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,970
Many trains have been stopped.

317
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:51,338
Sir, there was a blast on 509...
- No comments.

318
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,982
Are all the tracks ahead of it clear?

319
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,574
Sir, they are clear for
the next three stations.

320
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,548
But a lot of trains are getting
delayed because of these diversions.

321
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,413
There cannot be any issue
greater than this, at the moment.

322
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,888
See, I don't care.
- Sir...

323
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,857
Even if I've to cancel every
single train in the whole of England.

324
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,154
Excuse me, sir. Somebody's
here to see you. - Yeah.

325
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,819
If you do what I say...
- Sir, but... Sir.

326
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,124
Just do what I say.
- Arjun Khanna.

327
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,823
Counter Terrorism Command.

328
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,000
Sanjay Raina.
Railway Traffic Controller.

329
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,036
I heard that you spoke to the bomber.
- Yes.

330
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,902
You handled the
situation well, Mr. Raina.

331
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,275
In spite of you talking to
him he didn't stop the train.

332
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,872
Otherwise police's job
would have gotten easier.

333
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,407
Sir.

334
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,341
Excuse me.

335
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,409
Mr. Raina, how long will it
take the train to reach Glasgow?

336
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,011
About 101/2 hours.
- Yes, Miranda?

337
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,588
These are the trains that were
diverted to the south-east line.

338
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:41,916
And which is this one?

339
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,617
It's alright. Just give it to me.

340
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,055
Who could it be?

341
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,888
Not a terrorist.

342
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,293
If he would've been one, he
couldn't have called to inform.

343
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,070
He would've called after the
incident to claim responsibility.

344
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,330
If he is not a terrorist
then what does he want?

345
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,635
Get me that.
- You spoke to the bomber, Mr. Raina.

346
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,075
It's yourjob to give me the details.
- Fine.

347
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,937
Was he an Indian or a Pakistani?

348
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,073
I think an Indian.
- Why do you think so?

349
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,618
Because he was talking
in Hindi and not Urdu.

350
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,212
Which accent was he talking in?
Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi?

351
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,617
Look...
- Sir.

352
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,120
Sir, we have a huge problem here.

353
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,623
Train 308 is on our track
coming from the opposite direction.

354
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,630
Oh, God. - We diverted all the
other trains, except this one.

355
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,423
How far is 308 from the other one?

356
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,001
10 minutes. - Change the track.
- We can't do that, sir. - Why?

357
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,366
Because there are only
two tracks in that area.

358
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,906
And there is already a
stopped goods train on that track.

359
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,669
There should be an
exchange line before the station.

360
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,070
Ken, get me your aerial
feed on the large monitor.

361
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,643
Okay. This is our train.

362
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,218
And on the same track
308 is coming towards us.

363
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:46,117
And on this track there
is just one exchange line.

364
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,949
Sir, this is the maintenance line.

365
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,928
You cannot change the track with
the speed of more than 50m/hr.

366
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,658
The train will topple.
- Even I know that.

367
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,297
But railways, as a safety precaution...

368
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,425
...sets the limits 15-20 miles lower.

369
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,970
We'll have to take this turn
at the speed of more than 60.

370
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,562
We have to take that chance.
- But sir...

371
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,141
We have to take that chance, Radhika.

372
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,167
How long it will take for our
train to reach the exchange point?

373
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,640
Three minutes.

374
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,175
And 308?
- Sir, five minutes.

375
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,516
Sir... - If both the trains
have to cross safely then...

376
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,714
...both have to reach their
exchange point at the same time.

377
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,326
Radhika, tell the driver of
308 to come towards us at 97m/hr.

378
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,191
Are you sure, sir?
- Just do it, Radhika.

379
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,960
John, give me the headphones.

380
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,500
Richard, hear me carefully.

381
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,435
There's an inbound
train coming your way.

382
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,976
You have to reduce
your speed to 65m/hr.

383
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,241
Do it now, Richard. - But 65m/hr
is too close to the trigger point.

384
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,578
Damn it, Richard. You have to
take that risk or it's over.

385
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,277
Do it now.

386
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,747
Kevin, you be on your toes.

387
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,219
You make the change when
they give you the signal.

388
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,418
You hear me, Kevin?

389
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,304
Three. Two. One.

390
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,164
Now.

391
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,319
Now.

392
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,040
This is not yet the time to celebrate.

393
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,505
This is just the beginning, guys.

394
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,110
Please get back to work.
Thanks. Thank you.

395
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,718
Yes, Vikas? - Sir, I've
checked the database of all Indian...

396
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,293
...and Pakistani history-sheeters.

397
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,225
All of them are under the
watchful eyes of our officers.

398
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:08,054
I don't think he is one of them.
- Okay.

399
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,659
That means he's a new scoundrel.

400
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,534
Okay, do one thing.
Reach Railway's goods station.

401
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,797
I'll meet you there.

402
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,409
"Without you..."

403
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,576
"Without you I feel restless."

404
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,549
"I feel restless."

405
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,624
"Without you..."

406
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,629
"Without you I feel restless."

407
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,560
"I feel restless."

408
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:22,796
"You are my life."

409
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:30,373
"You are my happiness."

410
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:37,713
"You are my prayer."

411
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:47,194
He's get a British
citizenship if he marries you.

412
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,157
And also be the
proprietor of my wealth.

413
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,828
And yet, you want to
make him my son-in-law.

414
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,427
Whether or not you make
him your son-in-law...

415
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,870
...I surely want him to be my husband.

416
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,202
Oh, shut up.

417
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,638
What is his stature, after all?

418
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,345
Father, show some respect.

419
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,538
He's better educated than
you are. He's an engineer.

420
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,776
Nikita, if you want to
spend your life with them...

421
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,652
...then you'll have
to leave this house.

422
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:18,554
Aakash, come on.

423
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,840
"I swear. I swear, beloved."

424
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,581
"I am... I am crazy about you."

425
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,815
"How do I live?"

426
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,324
"How do I live, tell me."

427
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:51,918
"I can't die either."

428
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,591
"I swear. I swear, beloved."

429
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:59,396
"I am... I am crazy about you."

430
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,732
"How do I live?"

431
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,296
"How do I live, tell me."

432
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:09,310
"I can't die either."

433
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,443
"You are my life."

434
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:23,752
"You are my prayer."

435
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,934
"Without you... Without
you I feel restless."

436
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,430
"I feel restless."

437
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,302
"How do I say it? Where do I go?"

438
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,467
"Who do I worship?"

439
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,341
"Who do I worship?"

440
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,916
Excuse me. Manish Solanki.
He's in Ward A, bed four.

441
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,486
Okay. One moment.

442
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,554
The payment has to be
made before the operation.

443
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,330
Sir, I have checked
the entire CCTV footage.

444
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,093
I couldn't see anyone.
- Okay, when did the goods train come?

445
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,527
Here, sir. On this track.

446
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,343
This area, sir.

447
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,680
Forceps.

448
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,029
Vikas.

449
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,098
I want the footage of the
past 24 hours from this camera.

450
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,729
Is this your bike?

451
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,473
Yes, it is.
- How many bikes do you have?

452
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,598
Five in total.

453
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,643
And all five of them
were with you last night?

454
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,572
No, three of them were with me.

455
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,476
Two of them are in the
garage getting repaired.

456
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,672
Where's the garage?

457
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:35,141
The Alfa point center.
Over on Richard Street.

458
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,744
Thank you.

459
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,489
Railway Control Security.
May I help you?

460
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,682
I want Sanjay.

461
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,221
Yes, its ready. Take it.

462
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,219
Sanjay here.
- Stay close to the phone...

463
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,488
...or this train won't
stay close to the ground.

464
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,093
Okay. What do you want?

465
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,730
10 million euros.

466
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,996
Old currency.

467
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,533
Why this silence?

468
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,242
You aren't paying from your pocket.

469
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,706
10 million isn't much for 500 lives.

470
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,578
Listen...
- You have one hour.

471
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,164
Yes, Vikas? - Sir, the bomber
has asked for 10 million euros.

472
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,499
Then the bomb will surely blow.

473
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,866
The ministry won't pay up so easily.

474
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,229
What's the ministry's take on it?

475
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,029
They haven't taken any
decision as yet, sir.

476
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,071
Will they take a decision
after the bomb explodes?

477
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,268
Anyway, keep me posted.

478
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,512
The smoke meter's diaphragm...

479
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,078
Greetings. Welcome.

480
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,013
What happened? Your car stalled?
- Police.

481
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:45,183
Look, sir, I will tell you.

482
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,257
I am sure Mrs. Khanna must
have lodged a complaint.

483
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,158
Mrs. Khanna on purpose
wears skimpy clothes...

484
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,230
...and passes by my window.
I get compelled to whistle. I...

485
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,593
How many people work in here?

486
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,061
Here? Only six.

487
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,156
Everyone has a permit.

488
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,895
Everyone?
- Two don't.

489
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,227
It will come. I am trying.

490
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,266
Where are they?
- Here.

491
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,600
Novice. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Hurry up.

492
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,636
Hurry up.

493
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,214
Say hello to sir.
- Hello.

494
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,207
Where's the other one? The dark egg?

495
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,217
Sir, he didn't come today.
- He didn't?

496
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,087
I look at their innocent faces
and give them work and get trapped.

497
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,282
Where were you last night?
- I was with Mrs. Patil.

498
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,749
My wife, sir.

499
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,217
Where were you?

500
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,785
I was here, at work, sir.
- Alone?

501
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,862
Tell him. - No, sir.
Aadil was with me. - Who is Aadil?

502
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,332
The one I told you about.
The boy working without a permit.

503
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,128
The other mechanic.
- He was with you the entire night?

504
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,672
Yes. No.

505
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,570
He had left to test the bike.

506
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,701
What time?

507
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,105
At 10 or 11 pm.

508
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,647
Which bike?
- Chip Shop's owner's bike.

509
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,348
Fish and chips' bike?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

510
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,053
Do you know Aadil? His whereabouts?
Where does he stay?

511
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,588
Do you have his address?

512
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,252
Sir, he didn't have a permit.
I just appointed him.

513
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,124
So, now we don't have documents.

514
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,698
One day you too will go to
jail along with such boys.

515
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,323
Vikas. Immediately send a
sketch artist to Alfa Garage.

516
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,697
We need a sketch of a boy named Aadil.

517
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,135
Yes.
- I guess we have got our guy.

518
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,271
What? There's a bomb?

519
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,771
What? A bomb on the train?
- There's a bomb on the train.

520
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,275
Listen, everybody.
There's a bomb on the train.

521
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,645
Oh, my God.
- Are you sure?

522
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,911
Sir...
- It's all over the news.

523
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,953
Everybody, there's a bomb on
the train. - What? This...

524
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,612
How did he come to know?

525
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,782
Is there a bomb?

526
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,922
Move. Move, you.

527
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,619
Why did you hide it from us?
Why didn't you tell us?

528
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,755
Our lives are in danger
and you hid this from us!

529
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,826
Close the door.

530
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,335
Shut the door. And get inside.

531
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,699
Shut the door. Get inside.

532
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,272
Leave him!

533
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,806
Move!

534
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,168
Don't push it.

535
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,744
Go back to your seats
and sit down. Everybody.

536
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,715
Stop it.
- You get off him.

537
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,285
I'll blow your head
off if you touch anybody.

538
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,284
Okay? Go back to your seat.

539
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,013
Go.

540
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,163
Yes, there's a bomb on this train.

541
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:14,336
We can't stop or even
reduce the speed below 60m/hr.

542
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,229
Or the bomb will explode.

543
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,437
We can either panic right
now and make things hard...

544
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,345
...or we can stay calm...

545
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,676
...and trust the government
to get us out of this mess.

546
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,443
The position of the
British government...

547
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,810
...on terrorist acts is very clear.

548
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:35,021
There will be no
negotiation whatsoever.

549
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,193
Let's make it official.

550
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,260
All in favor raise your hands.

551
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,334
Mr. Khanna doesn't seem
to agree with our opinion.

552
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,403
May I ask you exactly
what do you have in mind?

553
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,710
I think we should
have the money ready.

554
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,978
Sir, all I am asking you to
is make the money visible.

555
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,314
It will be a tool for me to negotiate.

556
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,053
A way to get the boomer out in
the open. It will be just a bait.

557
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,960
And if you lose the
criminal and the money?

558
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:18,792
Sir...

559
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,227
You've believed in me for 23 years.

560
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,366
And I never failed to deliver.

561
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,238
You called me back from
retirement all because of your trust.

562
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,009
Just trust me one last time.

563
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,383
And I promise you,
I'll not lose the money...

564
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,381
...or the passengers on the train.

565
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,411
I'll get him.

566
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,751
Sir, Aadil's sketch has matched.

567
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,358
This is his file from
the immigration department.

568
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,352
Aadil Khan.

569
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,861
He came here from India, 7 years ago,
on a tourist visa, sir.

570
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,090
With a music troupe.

571
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,300
He neither went back nor
did he ever get caught.

572
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,802
Dispatch his photo and all his
details to all the police stations.

573
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,402
Bus stations. Police stations.
Airports. Everywhere.

574
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,407
Keep the police officers ready.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:42:58,809 --> 00:42:59,867
What's the news on the train?

576
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,768
The conductors have
checked all the compartments.

577
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:02,937
They didn't find any bomb, sir.

578
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,413
This means the bomb isn't
controlled by a lunatic.

579
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,009
This bomb is now controlled by speed.

580
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,377
Listen, Vikas.

581
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,549
From Railway Control Centre take
the details of the next bridge.

582
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,053
I need 4- 5 high speed
cameras under that bridge.

583
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,424
I ant clear pictures of
every compartment's base.

584
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,240
Dear, I'm a little busy. Can I...
- Daddy...

585
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,301
Am I going to die?

586
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,241
What are you saying, Pia?

587
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,576
Everyone here is saying that
there is a bomb in the train.

588
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,311
Everyone is going to die.

589
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,350
Nothing's going to happen to anyone.

590
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,854
I am concentrating only on your train.

591
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,155
I won't let anything happen to you.

592
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,988
Promise?

593
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,127
I promise.

594
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,371
Excuse me, Dr. Renu.
- Yes?

595
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,602
Please report to the front desk.

596
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,071
There's a telephone call for you.

597
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,537
Okay.

598
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,214
Hello.
- Hello, Renu? Renu, don't hang up.

599
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,148
Is Pia alright?

600
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,993
Renu, Pia is on a train.

601
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:29,427
And we've just got the news that
there is a bomb in that train.

602
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,865
Then stop the train and get Pia out.

603
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,895
We cannot do that.

604
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,366
Until I don't inform you
anything about the train...

605
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,339
...don't believe in
what anyone else says.

606
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,082
I'll keep in touch. Okay?

607
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,885
Got something for you, sir.

608
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,514
One moment.

609
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,050
Stop.

610
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,354
Now rewind.

611
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,989
Stop.

612
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,091
Zoom.

613
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,162
Bomb squad reports?
- That way, sir.

614
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,099
They say that the goods
train too had a similar bomb.

615
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,172
You see, sir, there is
an electronic dynamo.

616
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,245
It's sensor is attached
to the wheel of the train.

617
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,037
If the speed of the
train goes below 60...

618
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,951
...the dynamo will activate the
trigger and the bomb will explode.

619
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,345
It's all mentioned here, sir.

620
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,922
Under which compartments is the
bomb placed? - Four and seven.

621
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,115
Connect me to the
engineering department.

622
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,588
Send all the passengers in
the first three compartments.

623
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,127
Separate the rest of the
compartments from them.

624
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,163
I think that should work.
- I don't think that's possible.

625
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,356
What you are saying is impossible.

626
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,092
Why is it not possible?

627
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,469
If we switch off the main
hydraulics of the train then...

628
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,596
You don't understand.

629
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,401
This train runs on
an automatic system.

630
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,272
If you switch off the hydraulics,
the train will stop right there.

631
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,503
And that bomb will explode.

632
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,603
You mean to say there is
no way to stop the train?

633
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,081
There is no way you can stop
that train... - If there was any...

634
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,582
...I would've stopped it.

635
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,145
My daughter is on that train.

636
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,247
My daughter is on that train.

637
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,494
Hello.
- Sanjay.

638
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,592
Sanjay, my money?
- It's ready.

639
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,065
Do you have any idea of
how many innocent lives...

640
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,399
...you are putting in danger?

641
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,299
If you get caught you'll die.

642
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,738
Why are you playing with your life?

643
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,034
One shouldn't love life too much.

644
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,407
In the end, everyone has to lose it.

645
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,175
Look, I can help you if
you have been wronged.

646
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,253
You won't be able to catch
me even if you talk for long.

647
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,150
Give me my money... - Where do
you want the money delivered?

648
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,490
Who are you? - Arjun Khanna.
Counter Terrorist Command.

649
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,255
I'll get your money.
Where should I get it?

650
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,092
Mr. Khanna, put the money in a bag.

651
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,265
There should be no
tracking device in it.

652
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,127
Nor should there be
any officer with you.

653
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,992
You should come alone.

654
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,502
Till I don't get the money...

655
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,336
...no one will know the
way to defuse the bomb.

656
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,773
Glenalmond College.
Surrey. In 20 minutes.

657
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:33,206
Are you Mr. Arjun Khanna?
- Yes, Father.

658
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,745
Then I guess this belongs to you.

659
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,213
A gentleman delivered
it to us this morning.

660
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,288
He said you'll be
coming to collect it.

661
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,287
Did you happen to see his face?

662
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,592
Sorry, I didn't. He was
wearing some kind of helmet.

663
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,597
But he did seem to
be in a great hurry.

664
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,063
Hello. Mr. Khanna?

665
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,536
Speaking.
- Get into a car.

666
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,830
Get out through the
forth gate and take a left.

667
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,598
Go straight and take another left.

668
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,310
It will take you to an unpaved road.

669
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,435
Keep driving.

670
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,211
It was that scoundrel's call.

671
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,179
Vikas, I'm calling you.

672
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,114
You'll get this mobile's number.

673
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,211
As soon as the bomber calls again...

674
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,411
...trace his exact
location and tell me.

675
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,648
I'm taking this car.

676
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,630
Did you see "the inn" board?

677
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:29,730
Yes.

678
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,799
Turn right from there.

679
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,411
Half a kilometer away you will
see an "animal crossing" board.

680
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,414
Take a left from there.

681
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,289
Sir. Sir.

682
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,489
Yes, Vikas. Tell me.

683
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,292
Sir, the call got traced.

684
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,458
What's the exact location?

685
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,228
Alexandra, Bun No. 67 Hogway.

686
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,598
Okay. Go for him and get him alive.

687
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,331
I'll keep him busy.
- Okay, sir.

688
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,674
Come on, guys. Let's
get inside. Let's move.

689
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,439
Animal crossing road.

690
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,447
Got it. I got it.

691
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,489
Turn right.

692
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,767
Hello. I can't see any
Richards Farm's board here.

693
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,178
Mr. Khanna, I guess you
aren't paying attention.

694
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,912
I think I'll have to hang up.

695
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,374
Yes, I can see it. I can see it.

696
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,884
This is the police.
You've been surrounded.

697
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,983
Slowly come out with
your hands over your head.

698
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,588
There is no other way out for you.

699
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:44,832
Freeze.

700
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,312
Don't take a wrong
turn at any cost today.

701
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,309
It can prove to be dangerous.
Stop the car near the Rapid's board.

702
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,751
He watches a lot of English movies.

703
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,681
I'll have to give him that.

704
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,587
Will you tell us what to do next.

705
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:08,555
Get out of the car.

706
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,439
By now you must have
reached a riverbank.

707
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,908
Yes.

708
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,839
There, below a tree, there's
a yellow waterproof suitcase.

709
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,744
Got it?

710
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:40,755
Keep the money in it.

711
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,741
Now throw the suitcase in the water.

712
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:05,681
I said, throw the suitcase
in the water and walk away.

713
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,378
I want all units to setup a two
kilometer radius around this area.

714
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:05,676
All highway routes should be blocked.

715
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,750
No vehicle should be allowed
to pass without being checked.

716
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,050
Please go to shore.

717
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,722
Please stop otherwise we
will have to open fire.

718
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,662
This is your last warning.

719
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:27,867
Please stop otherwise we
will have to open fire.

720
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,498
This is your very last warning.

721
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,307
Every time I think you
cannot do anything more stupid...

722
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,438
...you prove me wrong.

723
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:53,913
Who the hell do you think you are?

724
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,483
Who told you to give in?

725
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,348
How are we going to
stop the train now?

726
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:00,286
Hey, look, if you can't handle it,
you should've left it to us.

727
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,448
You are an amateur.

728
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,017
It was an accident.

729
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,320
You coming back was the accident.

730
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,089
We needed him alive.

731
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:12,932
The bomber is still alive.

732
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,363
She was not the bomber.

733
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,633
She?
- Don't look confused.

734
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,943
There's more than one
person involved in this crime.

735
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:24,311
So, how do you intend to proceed?
What is the plan?

736
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,382
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

737
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,882
As you know, Alan, that investigations
are based on leads.

738
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,012
And I have one.

739
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,248
Vikas.
- Sir.

740
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,391
I got this hospital bill
from that girl's pocket.

741
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,150
Get all the details possible.

742
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,252
And do this fast. We
are running out of time.

743
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,212
Stop.

744
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,038
No. Please let me go.
Let me go, please.

745
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,138
Please. I have not done anything.

746
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,046
What's happening?
What's happening out here?

747
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,011
Please, don't hand
me over to the police.

748
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,516
They will send me
back to India. Please.

749
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,657
It's my... It's a question of my life.

750
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:48,323
Along with mine, my family's
life will also get ruined.

751
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:51,399
Please. Let me go. Please.

752
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,532
I haven't done anything wrong.

753
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,172
I'm scared for my life.

754
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,505
Please, sir.

755
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,488
Hello?

756
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,659
Did everything go well, sir?

757
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,260
Hello?

758
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,569
Where are you? Where is Megha?

759
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,298
Megha is dead.

760
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,438
No. Oh, God. No.

761
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,374
Aadil.
- No!

762
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:39,572
Aadil!

763
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,519
Moments ago, a high
speed chase on the M25...

764
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,321
...has resulted in the death
of the London railway bomber.

765
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:55,295
Authorities have said that the
bomber, a female in her twenties...

766
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,465
...was trying to
escape on her dirt-bike...

767
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,263
...and had a fatal accident
during the chase with the police.

768
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,668
Hello?
- Hello, Sanjay?

769
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,300
Sanjay, tell me the truth.

770
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,372
Everyone here is
telling me a different story.

771
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:16,218
I had told you, no matter what
anyone tells you about this train...

772
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,547
...don't believe in it.

773
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:22,247
But in the news they are
showing that the bomber is dead.

774
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,056
That train won't stop. Media...

775
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,760
Media has gone crazy.

776
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,829
The bomber is a guy.
He is still alive.

777
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,657
And I am talking to him.

778
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,669
I hope you are not saying
so just to calm me down.

779
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,396
Do one thing.

780
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,068
Talk to her. You'll feel better.

781
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,742
Hello?
- Hello.

782
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,614
Hello, Pia?
- Mamma?

783
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,713
Are you alright, dear?

784
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,222
Yes. But how did you get my number?

785
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,517
Your father gave it to me.

786
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,521
You spoke to him?

787
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,124
Yes, dear.

788
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,127
Hello?

789
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,233
The bomber is dead.

790
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,397
It's all over.

791
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,602
We are all going to die.

792
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,307
I'm not going to die like this.

793
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:16,172
I bet we can jump off this train.
- Please sit down.

794
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,112
How are you going to defuse the
bomb if the bomber is already dead?

795
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,613
The bomber is not dead.

796
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:21,774
How do you know?

797
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,478
My daddy is a chief of
railway control centre.

798
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,151
What's your name?
- Pia. Pia Raina.

799
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:28,789
Okay, Pia, what did your father say?

800
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:31,587
He told my mother that
the bomber is not dead.

801
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,355
Can I talk to your father?

802
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:50,906
I found sister-in-law's address.

803
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,288
She's a teacher in
some kindergarten school.

804
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,653
I didn't get any other information.

805
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,193
Megha's brother's
operation was to take place today.

806
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:12,759
Of what?

807
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,596
He has started lose vision.
Both his eyes.

808
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,668
The operation is very expensive.

809
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,542
And if he doesn't get it done,
he can go blind.

810
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,610
I think they have found
out that we are Indians.

811
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,760
Unit four, are you in position?

812
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,422
In position, sir. Shall I go in?

813
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,464
No. Hold your positions.

814
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,924
Nobody approaches the
target without my orders.

815
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:54,266
Aadil, run.

816
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:04,544
Hey.

817
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,224
Hey, stop.
- Stop. - No. Stop!

818
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,389
Stop.
- Stop.

819
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,016
Come on. Stop. Stop.

820
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,824
Stop!

821
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,894
Come on. Come on.
- Whoa, whoa.

822
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,826
Come on. Stop.
- There.

823
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:50,390
Get him. Get him.

824
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:51,633
Get him.

825
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,635
Just kill him.

826
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:09,777
Whoa, whoa.

827
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,368
Oh!
- Get him.

828
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:15,381
Watch it, man.

829
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,950
"Speed."

830
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,822
"Speed."

831
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:31,992
"Everybody... speed."

832
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,568
"Speed."

833
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,503
"Everybody... speed."

834
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:40,408
"Speed."

835
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,569
"Speed."

836
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,087
Stop, or I shoot.

837
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,859
Get down, everybody get down.

838
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:11,965
I've got him.

839
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,747
Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge.

840
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:32,652
Stop. I said stop.

841
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,457
Damn it.

842
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,519
Drive.

843
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,156
Good morning.
- Good morning.

844
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,201
Here. Have some sweets.

845
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:50,001
Sweets? What are we celebrating?

846
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,504
Remember, I had told you
about my brother, Manish?

847
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,109
He has got an admission in
an engineering college here.

848
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,702
Oh, that's nice.

849
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,605
But how did he come to UK?

850
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,117
He didn't come through
illegitimate means like us, sir.

851
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,685
He has come legally.

852
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:07,082
He has got student visa.

853
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,084
Then you deserve
double congratulations.

854
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,758
He'll be an engineer like me.

855
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,855
This has been possible
only because of you.

856
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:14,990
You had done a lot of favors.

857
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:19,264
My parents...
- Enough. Enough. Enough.

858
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:20,592
Give me the sweets.

859
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,279
This is a routine check.
Stay where they are.

860
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,571
This is the UK Border Agency.

861
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,809
Everybody stay where they are.

862
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:41,255
Wait a minute. Sir,
please. Plesae leave me, sir.

863
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,260
Sir, people from the
immigration department are outside.

864
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,689
They are checking everyone's papers.

865
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:51,925
What should we do?

866
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,697
...get away!

867
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,571
Aadil. You leave with Megha.

868
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,677
Sir, but you?

869
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,108
I'll take care of them.
You both leave.

870
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,137
But, sir, you too.
- Just stop it.

871
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,306
I said go.

872
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,617
Come on, Megha, let's go. Come on.

873
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:24,830
Yes, officer.

874
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:25,829
Is there a problem?

875
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:29,066
My name is Peter Harvey from
the Department of Immigration.

876
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,764
We've just been
checking your workers' papers.

877
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,933
And a few of them
don't seem to have...

878
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,600
...the proper
documentation to work in the UK.

879
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,310
I guess I am not aware of that.

880
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,041
What's yourjob here, sir?

881
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,377
I am the CEO.
- And who owns the company?

882
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,051
My wife.
- Can I see your papers, please?

883
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:50,618
I have applied for my
citizenship and work permit.

884
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,660
I have a copy of that.
- Sir, without citizenship...

885
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,161
...and work permit you
cannot work in this country.

886
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,198
I'm afraid you have to come with us.

887
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,650
It's okay. It's okay.
It's almost done.

888
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,244
Just relax.

889
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:21,882
May I know who he is?

890
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,762
Someone who has nothing to lose.

891
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,855
And you?

892
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,861
Someone who has lost everything.

893
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,260
Let's go.

894
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:43,836
Thanks, Doctor.

895
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,331
I think we should stop right here.

896
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:17,369
Why?

897
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,346
Our intention was to commit a
crime and get our lives back.

898
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,784
Without endangering anyone's life.

899
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,855
Megha has lost her life.

900
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,894
And you are injured.

901
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,034
I don't want the money at
the expense of your life.

902
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,898
It's no use backing out now, sir.

903
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:48,334
Megha is dead.

904
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:52,243
And if I didn't have the
hope that you would return...

905
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,746
...then I would've
hanged myself long back.

906
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:58,510
Who do we fear?

907
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:03,788
If we don't win,
what do we have to lose?

908
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,226
And if we win, we have
our lives ahead of us.

909
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:17,529
Give it here.

910
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,537
Yeah, Sanjay here. - Everyone in
this world wants to go to heaven.

911
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,337
But no one wants to
die to go to heaven.

912
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,538
Your mistake will today take
those passengers to heaven.

913
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:28,874
The deal is off.

914
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:41,022
Have you gone mad?

915
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,792
Who the hell do you think you are?

916
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,356
When the government had
given you the money...

917
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:49,869
...to give to the bomber then
why did you have to act smart?

918
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,433
You should have quietly given
the money and defused the bomb.

919
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,910
That money was a means
to catch those scoundrels.

920
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,809
Not to fulfill their demands.

921
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:02,043
Now just calm down.
- Now don't you tell me to calm down.

922
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:04,978
I've been trying my best to
save the train since morning...

923
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,146
...so that you get time
for your investigation.

924
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,452
A lot of time has been wasted,
but the little hope that we had...

925
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:11,821
...you have ruined that as well.

926
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,329
Mr. Sanjay, I understand.
- No, you don't understand.

927
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,295
Because you don't have
anyone close to you on that train.

928
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,368
Shut up. Everyone in that
train has a near and dear one.

929
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,299
I don't need a reason
to save people's lives.

930
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,066
It's my job. It's my duty.

931
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,871
He will call back.

932
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,169
Why will he call back?
How do you know so?

933
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,403
I'm telling you, he will call.
- Why will he call?

934
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:34,175
Because he won't leave without
taking his money. - He will not call.

935
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,408
It's him.
- He will call.

936
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:37,409
It's him.

937
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,586
Hello. - Take the money
and go St. Georges hall.

938
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:48,627
And don't do
anything stupid this time.

939
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,189
Last chance.

940
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,928
Excuse me, mister. This is for you.

941
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,897
Who gave you this? Hey, listen.

942
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,198
Put the bag in the
trash can behind you.

943
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,135
Keep an eye on the green dustbin.

944
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,439
I repeat...

945
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,611
Alpha Team, talk to me.

946
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,517
No, sir. Nothing yet.

947
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:23,090
Snipers. Keep an eye
on the green dustbin.

948
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,086
No fatal shots. I want
this guy alive. - Okay.

949
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,968
Here's your coffee, sir.
- Okay. Thank you.

950
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,127
Thank you.

951
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,110
Sir, I've just seen
something in his hand.

952
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,244
Bravo Team, do you see anything?

953
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,287
No sir, still looking. Nothing yet.

954
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:00,189
He will come. We will see him soon.

955
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,433
Target confirmed.
Approaching drop point.

956
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:14,270
Everyone, now, stay calm.

957
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,571
Be focused. Be focused.

958
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:23,044
Negative, sir.

959
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:22,534
"Hey, everybody pay"

960
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:30,476
"Hey days, days, days, p-p-pay"

961
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,546
Can I have a word with you, please?

962
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,177
They've found a suspect.

963
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:38,719
That's his picture.

964
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:46,886
'Do you have the packages? '

965
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,424
'What's the idea?
- You'll know soon.'

966
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:58,566
Stay back.

967
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,730
Move. Move. Move.

968
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:03,208
Hey. Where's the emergency brake?
- I don't know, man. Calm down.

969
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,905
Go ahead. You'll show
me the emergency brake.

970
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:06,304
Stay back.

971
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,219
Move. Move. Move. Stay down.

972
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,346
The emergency brakes have to be
put on anyhow before any station.

973
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,254
Where are the brakes?
- There.

974
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:22,456
Why aren't they working?

975
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:23,622
The driver has jammed the brakes.

976
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,596
Open up or I'll blow the door.

977
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,575
If you got to shoot someone, shoot me.

978
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,694
We got to get off this train.
We got to get off this train.

979
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,326
We got to get off this train.
We are going to die.

980
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,961
Shut up.
- We are going to die. - Shut up.

981
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:06,603
It's true. It's true.
- What's true?

982
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,336
I sold the explosives to him, okay?

983
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:12,641
I saw him at the railway station.

984
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:13,839
Saw whom?

985
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:15,474
The bomber.

986
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,710
You know him?
- Yes.

987
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:18,877
Who's he?

988
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:22,616
His name is Aadil Khan.
- Where does he stay?

989
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:30,992
Hello?
- Job's done.

990
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:32,560
Yes. Yes.

991
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:34,860
Yes.

992
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:36,697
How are you feeling?

993
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:38,767
Now I'm feeling great, sir.

994
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,939
Okay, I'm coming. I will
be back in five minute.

995
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:44,402
Okay.

996
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,687
Keep moving back. Back.
- Keep moving back. - Back.

997
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,628
Please. Come on.

998
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,529
Move.
- Move back.

999
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,368
Move back.

1000
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:42,766
Move back.

1001
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,374
Second floor, rear window.

1002
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,939
Repeat...

1003
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:04,448
Hello. - Aadil,
try leaving through the back door.

1004
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:07,824
No, sir. Police has
surrounded the place.

1005
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,396
Then I'll come upstairs.

1006
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:12,900
Don't try to save me,
you too will die.

1007
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:14,525
Then we will die together.

1008
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:15,694
Come on, move back.

1009
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:17,464
Please leave, sir.

1010
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:18,597
Just go.

1011
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:20,133
Get back.

1012
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:21,465
Get back.

1013
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,031
Team A, cover. Cover.

1014
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,151
Drop your weapons. You're arrested.

1015
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:09,922
Come out with your hands up.

1016
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:11,890
Come on immediately.

1017
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,791
Drop your weapons. You're arrested.

1018
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,796
Come out with your hands up

1019
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:18,726
Immediately.

1020
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:30,142
If you move, you'll die.

1021
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:33,878
Me or we?

1022
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:12,839
The investigation strategy
was to get the bomber alive...

1023
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,938
...defuse the bomb and
save the passengers.

1024
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:16,277
And what are you doing?

1025
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:19,085
Killing them one by one. Who
the hell do you think you are?

1026
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,313
Dirty Harry?

1027
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,323
He blew himself up.

1028
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:24,682
It was a suicide.

1029
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,852
Oh, so, now, what do
you suggest we do?

1030
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,226
Catch the real bomber.

1031
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:34,601
The man who has the money.
- Yeah.

1032
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:39,106
The idea of the money
was to use it as bait.

1033
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:43,909
Hey, he's lost all the money.
He's killing all the bombers.

1034
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,002
He screwed up the whole operation.

1035
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:49,208
For all we know, he could
be a part of the conspiracy.

1036
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:52,150
And gets his share of money
when he gets back to India.

1037
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:53,914
What did you say?

1038
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:55,886
Another word and I'll break yourjaw.
- Sir.

1039
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,355
I'll break yourjaw.
- Sir. Sir. No, sir.

1040
01:29:57,658 --> 01:29:58,784
Vikas, let go of me.

1041
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,258
Let me teach him a lesson.
- Sir, please. Please. Stop.

1042
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:02,659
What does he think of himself?
- Yes.

1043
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:04,959
Get him off me.
- You foreigner!

1044
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,227
Let it be, Vikas, I will show him.
- No, sir.

1045
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,996
Get him off me.
- Sir, let it be.

1046
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,264
Leave me.
- Sir. Let it be, sir.

1047
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:12,862
Listen to what he is saying.
- Let it be, sir. Please.

1048
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:16,369
We are getting defamed
because of such scoundrels.

1049
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:21,040
One man plants a bomb
and because of that...

1050
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:24,744
...his community and his
country gets slandered.

1051
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:33,888
Today it's either me or the bomber.

1052
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,326
Sanjay here.

1053
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,132
There's a restaurant at
Alford Lane. Delhi Darbar.

1054
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,399
There's a table booked in your name.

1055
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:48,174
You'll find an envelope on the table.

1056
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,074
It contains the instructions
on how to defuse the bomb.

1057
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,157
"I am dew."

1058
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:17,301
"You are my dawn."

1059
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:20,238
"I am love."

1060
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:22,241
"You are my world."

1061
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,143
"I am the speaker."

1062
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:29,841
"You are my prayer."

1063
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:32,914
"I am the ground."

1064
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,921
"You are my sky."

1065
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,882
"We met, in spite of
being worlds apart."

1066
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:42,724
That's my husband. He's my husband.

1067
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:46,027
"Nothing came between us."
- He's my husband.

1068
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:52,265
"Let me spend my
life with you, beloved."

1069
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:58,778
"Let me spend my
life with you, beloved."

1070
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,279
Aakash.
- "In your arms..."

1071
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:01,871
"In your path..."

1072
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:03,382
"In your arms..."

1073
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:04,974
"In your path..."

1074
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:08,055
"Let me spend my life."

1075
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:09,884
"With you..."

1076
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:15,486
"Let me spend my
life with you, beloved."

1077
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,780
I tried hard to look for you.

1078
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,520
Phone calls, letters, emails.

1079
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,452
But I didn't get any reply.

1080
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,825
Then I thought of asking your father.

1081
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,322
All I got was abuses.

1082
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:52,422
I was in prison for six months.

1083
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:57,937
The loan we took was in my name.

1084
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,004
After you left, I couldn't
repay the loan on my own.

1085
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:06,278
First I went under trial
and then I was imprisoned.

1086
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:15,921
Our child?

1087
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:19,424
He's playing outside.

1088
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:22,488
He?

1089
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:38,845
Daddy.

1090
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,293
How did he recognize me?

1091
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:03,901
I've been telling your son about
you since the last four years.

1092
01:34:04,905 --> 01:34:07,601
And everyday, he looks at
this picture and waits for you.

1093
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,969
What is your name?
- Aakash.

1094
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,246
Go out and play, Aakash.

1095
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,956
The name Aakash holds some hope to it.

1096
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,287
I wish you were here.

1097
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,356
I wish we were together.

1098
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:34,331
I couldn't find a name better
than Aakash to live with this hope.

1099
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:40,337
Nikita, I'm here to take you.

1100
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:53,220
Come back, man. Come back.

1101
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:01,054
The letter that you had
kept for us in Delhi Darbar...

1102
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:02,561
...got burnt with the restaurant.

1103
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:04,497
We are making an appeal.

1104
01:35:04,598 --> 01:35:09,001
Call us for the last time and
tell us, how do we disarm this bomb.

1105
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:10,127
This is an appeal.

1106
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:11,363
Thank you. That's it.

1107
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:14,134
How much time do we have?

1108
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:16,270
Sir, two hours.

1109
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:18,944
Okay. One second.

1110
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:22,273
Ask the rescue team,
if we run another train...

1111
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:25,144
...parallel to this one,
at the same speed...

1112
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:30,354
...can they transfer the passengers
from one train to another?

1113
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,982
Come on. Come on.

1114
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:01,384
Move your hand. Give me your hand.

1115
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:03,116
You need to help her.

1116
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,324
Grab my hand. Come on.

1117
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,457
Come on. Steady. Steady.

1118
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,092
Be careful.

1119
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:25,442
Come on!

1120
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:31,277
I can't.
- Don't look down.

1121
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:32,443
Keep moving.

1122
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:37,090
Please, go.

1123
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:53,098
Faster, faster.

1124
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:55,036
Give me your hand.

1125
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,110
You can do it.
- Faster, faster.

1126
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:00,774
Give me your hand.

1127
01:37:01,081 --> 01:37:03,481
Give me your hand.

1128
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:05,211
Faster. Give me your hand.

1129
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:20,231
Mr. Manish. Someone's come to see you.

1130
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:24,428
Who is it?

1131
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:28,404
I'm Megha's friend.

1132
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:32,474
She has told me about you.
And I came here to...

1133
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:34,610
You are here to pay the
fees for the operation?

1134
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:39,142
Yes.

1135
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,144
I'm here to pay the fees.

1136
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:43,256
You are brother Aakash, right?

1137
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:44,415
No, I'm Arjun.

1138
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:49,686
Which Aakash are you talking about?

1139
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:51,756
Aakash Rana.

1140
01:37:52,299 --> 01:37:55,166
My sister treated him like a brother.

1141
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,600
She had said that he
and brother Aadil...

1142
01:37:58,672 --> 01:38:00,367
...will come to meet
me before the operation.

1143
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:04,542
Surprising. Aadil never
told me anything about Aakash.

1144
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:09,507
Four years ago, he was their boss.

1145
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:12,845
Then, all of a sudden, he
had to shut down the company...

1146
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:14,313
...and go to a foreign country.

1147
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:17,481
I heard that he came
back a few days back.

1148
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:20,259
Yes, Megha was
saying something about it.

1149
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:21,753
I don't remember the company's name.

1150
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:23,421
What was the name of the company?

1151
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:24,823
Global services.

1152
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:26,793
Global services.

1153
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:28,793
Okay.

1154
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:35,204
Sister said she'll be
back before the operation.

1155
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:49,248
Hello, Vikas. Do a
background check on Aakash Rana.

1156
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:52,155
We deported him to
India 4-5 years ago.

1157
01:38:52,526 --> 01:38:55,495
He used to work here in a
company called Global Services.

1158
01:38:55,696 --> 01:38:57,163
I want details of his family,
his friends.

1159
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:58,731
I want details of his every move.

1160
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:04,860
Excuse me. Please
charge for Manish Solanki.

1161
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,839
I think it's Ward E, bed four.

1162
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:08,832
Sorry, what name?
- Manish Solanki.

1163
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:10,540
Oh, everything has
already been paid for, sir.

1164
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,811
By whom?
- Oh, he was just here.

1165
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:16,178
He left for the ward.
Just down that corridor.

1166
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:30,455
Vikas, that scoundrel is here.

1167
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:32,426
He just paid the hospital bill.

1168
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:35,235
I am getting all doors and
exits of the hospital closed.

1169
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:36,327
You quickly send backup.

1170
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:40,533
Please call security.

1171
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:49,646
This is Detective Arjun Khanna.

1172
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:50,910
Counter Terrorism Command.

1173
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,552
The train bomber has been
spotted in your hospital.

1174
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:56,222
Yes. The train bomber has
been spotted in your hospital.

1175
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:59,959
I want you to lock all your doors,
exits, anything to get of here.

1176
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,387
Nobody moves out of the
hospital till the police comes.

1177
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:05,356
Come with me, I want to see his face.
- Sorry?

1178
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:07,331
I mean I want you to identify him.

1179
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:08,899
I want you to identify him.
Please come with me.

1180
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,231
Okay.

1181
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:03,417
Please calm down.

1182
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:07,787
Please go home and wait.

1183
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:20,431
There he is.

1184
01:41:22,643 --> 01:41:23,701
He's gone that way.

1185
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:11,749
Police.

1186
01:42:13,827 --> 01:42:14,919
Come out.

1187
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:20,925
No.

1188
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:22,560
Open the boot.

1189
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:33,570
Sorry.

1190
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:16,682
CTC.
- Sir.

1191
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:17,948
This is Anne.

1192
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,592
She has seen the suspect and
she'll be able to identify him.

1193
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:23,891
I want every person, every car,
every boot to be checked, now.

1194
01:43:23,997 --> 01:43:25,055
Yes, sir.
- Yes.

1195
01:43:25,599 --> 01:43:26,657
Yes, Vikas?

1196
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,601
Sir, there are some Air
India tickets booked...

1197
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:30,931
...under Aakash Rana's name.

1198
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,096
The flight leaves at eight.

1199
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,037
Some Nikita Rana and
a child are with him.

1200
01:43:34,141 --> 01:43:35,631
Where are you? Where
are you at the moment?

1201
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:36,766
I'm going to the headquarters, sir.

1202
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,534
Go to the airport, right away.

1203
01:43:38,645 --> 01:43:40,044
And go directly to
the check-in counter.

1204
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:43,116
And see to it that no one boards
the flight using those tickets.

1205
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:44,809
Are you listening? I'm on my way.

1206
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:58,494
So, we went up to look
at the security cameras.

1207
01:43:58,599 --> 01:43:59,691
Then we came down here...

1208
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:16,107
Sir.

1209
01:44:18,685 --> 01:44:19,743
So far no man named Aakash Rana...

1210
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:20,912
...has showed up at
the check-in counter.

1211
01:44:20,988 --> 01:44:22,114
Now the counter has closed, sir.

1212
01:44:22,222 --> 01:44:24,122
And there is no booking on
this name on any other flight.

1213
01:44:32,065 --> 01:44:36,195
Thoroughly crosscheck any
Indian or Asian you come across.

1214
01:44:36,536 --> 01:44:37,560
Sir.

1215
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:41,666
Did you get any photo or ID of Aakash?

1216
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,508
That will take a little time, sir.

1217
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:45,871
Immigration department will send
us a photo as soon as they find it.

1218
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:57,146
If he isn't taking flight then...

1219
01:44:58,558 --> 01:45:00,048
...there is only one way
to get out of this country.

1220
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,523
When does the train to Paris leave?

1221
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:05,559
Sir, I think, the last train
leaves in an hour and a half.

1222
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:09,263
He has made a fool out of us.

1223
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:10,661
Come on, let's go.

1224
01:45:30,257 --> 01:45:32,987
'The letter that you had
kept for us in Delhi Darbar... '

1225
01:45:33,226 --> 01:45:34,716
'... got burnt with the restaurant.'

1226
01:45:35,062 --> 01:45:36,723
'We are making an appeal.'

1227
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:41,096
'Call us for the last time and
tell us, how do we disarm this bomb.'

1228
01:45:41,201 --> 01:45:43,863
'This is an appeal.
Thank you. That's it.'

1229
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,235
Sir, the ministry has sent orders.

1230
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:51,573
We'll have to stop the
train at Glasgow station.

1231
01:45:53,914 --> 01:45:56,644
Sir, according to them, they
have got the station vacated.

1232
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:59,151
And they have also sent
a 90-member rescue team.

1233
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,618
This is not possible.
They have lost their mind.

1234
01:46:01,722 --> 01:46:03,656
The train cannot enter
the station at this speed.

1235
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:05,588
Anyway, if the speed goes below 60...

1236
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:07,250
...the bomb will explode
before it reaches the station.

1237
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:09,720
No, sir. They aren't
reducing the speed.

1238
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:12,025
They want the train
to crash against...

1239
01:46:12,132 --> 01:46:13,827
...the break-ribbons and
sandbags at the speed of 60.

1240
01:46:14,134 --> 01:46:15,624
Sir, the fire
brigades is already there.

1241
01:46:15,736 --> 01:46:18,034
They have also started
spraying the anti-fire chemicals.

1242
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:21,138
Doctors, paramedics,
police. Everyone is on standby.

1243
01:46:21,641 --> 01:46:23,939
Even the passengers are being
shifted to the last compartment.

1244
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:25,807
That will kill more
than half the people.

1245
01:46:26,012 --> 01:46:28,606
Sir, they say that at least
some people will get saved.

1246
01:46:28,715 --> 01:46:30,046
This is ridiculous. This is stupidity.

1247
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:31,341
Sir, it's him.

1248
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:34,845
Yes. Sanjay.

1249
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:36,047
There is no bomb on the train.

1250
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:37,347
You can stop the train.

1251
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:38,954
No, no. You are lying.

1252
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:41,085
Bomb squad has confirmed it.

1253
01:46:41,194 --> 01:46:43,685
I saw the bombs under the train.

1254
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:46,626
Yes, there are. But
they aren't activated.

1255
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:51,363
I had written the same in the
letter I had send to the restaurant.

1256
01:46:51,805 --> 01:46:55,241
Listen, please, don't play
with the lives of innocent people.

1257
01:46:55,308 --> 01:46:57,139
I cannot say anything more than that.

1258
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:01,175
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1259
01:47:01,882 --> 01:47:03,042
The bomberjust called.

1260
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:05,180
He said that the bombs are
fake and that they won't go off.

1261
01:47:05,285 --> 01:47:06,650
He is a liar.

1262
01:47:07,721 --> 01:47:09,245
We can't take that chance.

1263
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:14,125
We follow the ministry's orders
and stop the train at Glasgow only.

1264
01:47:14,227 --> 01:47:15,285
To hell with the orders.

1265
01:47:15,695 --> 01:47:17,185
I am stopping the train right now.

1266
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:20,722
You cannot override the ministry.
You understand!

1267
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:21,926
Oh yes, I can.

1268
01:47:22,002 --> 01:47:23,936
I'm in-charge here.
These are my people.

1269
01:47:24,037 --> 01:47:25,902
And they will do exactly
what I tell them to do.

1270
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:31,005
But sir, why do you trust him?

1271
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:35,236
Had he been a liar, he
wouldn't have called.

1272
01:47:35,849 --> 01:47:36,941
What?

1273
01:47:38,018 --> 01:47:41,215
He wouldn't have called if it's a lie.

1274
01:47:42,322 --> 01:47:43,846
If this goes wrong...

1275
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,860
...you are going down for life.

1276
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:52,921
John, stop the train.

1277
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:08,839
Hello?

1278
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:10,777
I will wait for you at the station.

1279
01:48:11,985 --> 01:48:13,077
I hope you come.

1280
01:48:15,222 --> 01:48:16,314
Yes, I'm coming.

1281
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:58,189
Yes?

1282
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:02,095
Are you... Nikita Rana?

1283
01:49:02,402 --> 01:49:03,767
Yes?

1284
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:40,337
Nikita, take a good look.

1285
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:43,309
The lives of 500 people
now rests in your hands.

1286
01:49:43,843 --> 01:49:47,040
Inform me as soon as you spot him.

1287
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,084
Excuse me.

1288
01:50:02,963 --> 01:50:04,021
He's here.

1289
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:06,564
Okay, good. Move closer to him.

1290
01:50:08,001 --> 01:50:09,025
Go to him.

1291
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:13,302
Authorities have
confirmed that the bomb on...

1292
01:50:13,406 --> 01:50:15,499
...the Glasgow bound
train 112 was a hoax.

1293
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:19,002
The high tension ordeal
which lasted 14 hours today...

1294
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:20,306
...has finally ended.

1295
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:23,038
There were no reports of
causalities as passengers...

1296
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:25,982
...started disembarking the
express train minutes earlier.

1297
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:29,852
There was no bomb
connected to the train.

1298
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:31,150
Everyone's safe.

1299
01:50:31,257 --> 01:50:35,023
All the passengers of 112 have
alighted from the train safely.

1300
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:53,239
Don't look towards me.

1301
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:05,449
Nikita?

1302
01:51:05,925 --> 01:51:07,017
Nikita?

1303
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:10,890
Nikita, can you hear me? Nikita?

1304
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,104
Where is he?

1305
01:51:29,315 --> 01:51:30,577
I'm asking you, where is he?

1306
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:33,984
Please tell me where is he.

1307
01:51:34,387 --> 01:51:35,547
Sorry, that wasn't Aakash.

1308
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:37,286
What do you mean he wasn't Aakash?

1309
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:39,255
He wasn't Aakash but someone else.

1310
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,183
I know you saw him.

1311
01:51:41,294 --> 01:51:42,352
I saw you looking at him.

1312
01:51:42,462 --> 01:51:44,123
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me.

1313
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:45,663
You are the one lying to me.

1314
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:47,560
You told me he's a bomber.

1315
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:51,000
Yes. Yes. He's a bomber.

1316
01:51:51,271 --> 01:51:53,569
And this is your only
chance to save the passengers.

1317
01:51:53,673 --> 01:51:55,038
Once again you are lying.

1318
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:56,673
Everyone is safe.

1319
01:51:57,143 --> 01:51:58,405
All the news channels are showing it.

1320
01:51:58,511 --> 01:51:59,637
Someone was playing a prank.

1321
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,480
And you want to
punish my husband for it?

1322
01:52:02,982 --> 01:52:05,348
Just because if entered
this country illegally?

1323
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:08,351
Just because he wants to
meet his wife and child?

1324
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:11,450
Why are you not getting this?

1325
01:52:11,991 --> 01:52:13,583
He is a criminal according to the law.

1326
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:15,426
And you are helping a criminal.

1327
01:52:16,096 --> 01:52:18,064
Your law has given a
very harsh punishment.

1328
01:52:18,431 --> 01:52:20,490
He just wanted to help people.

1329
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:23,968
Do you have any idea how
many lives and families...

1330
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:26,402
...has your law ruined?

1331
01:52:27,307 --> 01:52:28,501
Let him go.

1332
01:52:29,008 --> 01:52:30,703
He wants to leave this place for good.

1333
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:32,709
I won't let that happen.

1334
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:34,612
I will arrest him.

1335
01:52:34,714 --> 01:52:36,011
It's my duty.

1336
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:38,974
You... you...
- I cannot help you in it.

1337
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:41,042
You can find him on your own.

1338
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:42,679
Please.

1339
01:52:43,289 --> 01:52:45,519
Please. Please try to help me.

1340
01:52:46,259 --> 01:52:47,385
No.

1341
01:52:59,205 --> 01:53:00,502
Daddy.

1342
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:07,110
No. No. That's not him.

1343
01:53:07,747 --> 01:53:09,044
That's not Aakash.

1344
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:11,343
That's not him.

1345
01:53:12,752 --> 01:53:15,152
That's not him. No.

1346
01:54:15,548 --> 01:54:19,245
The bomber is on level one.
Send back up immediately.

1347
01:55:53,546 --> 01:55:54,604
Can I go now?

1348
01:55:56,215 --> 01:55:57,477
You have go...

1349
01:55:59,218 --> 01:56:00,310
But to a prison.

1350
01:56:04,724 --> 01:56:06,385
Surrender yourself.

1351
01:56:09,595 --> 01:56:11,187
You don't have a choice.

1352
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:12,589
I still have a choice.

1353
01:56:13,466 --> 01:56:14,694
Don't compel me.

1354
01:56:15,702 --> 01:56:16,828
You are a criminal.

1355
01:56:18,671 --> 01:56:20,332
You cannot escape your punishment.

1356
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:23,334
You don't need to be a
criminal to endure a punishment.

1357
01:56:24,777 --> 01:56:26,210
It's the same even
if you are innocent.

1358
01:56:27,313 --> 01:56:28,439
What wrong had I done?

1359
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:31,374
I tried to fulfill a
dream of a good life...

1360
01:56:31,484 --> 01:56:32,883
...through hard work and honesty.

1361
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:35,253
It was called cheating. A fraud.

1362
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:37,216
I helped the ones in need.

1363
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:39,315
It was called sabotage. A murder.

1364
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:42,390
When I married the one I loved,
it was called rape.

1365
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:44,296
Yet I got punished.

1366
01:56:45,365 --> 01:56:46,923
Everyone was taken away from me.

1367
01:56:47,467 --> 01:56:50,265
My wife, my child, my friends,
my hopes, my future.

1368
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:51,428
Everything.

1369
01:56:54,407 --> 01:56:56,238
You, too, must be
having a wife, a child.

1370
01:56:56,876 --> 01:56:57,968
Ask your heart...

1371
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,904
...what would have you
done had you been in my place?

1372
01:57:03,282 --> 01:57:07,480
And still, if you think that
I am wrong then take the gun.

1373
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,251
And shoot me.

1374
01:57:11,824 --> 01:57:14,759
I am going, to my child.

1375
01:57:15,962 --> 01:57:19,693
I want to hug him and
sleep in peace for a night.

1376
01:57:22,769 --> 01:57:23,895
No.

1377
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:47,359
'We had a lot of dreams
which stayed as dreams.'

1378
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:52,329
'There was love, thank God,
it stayed intact.'

1379
01:57:54,467 --> 01:57:57,664
'Lf you are reading this
letter then it's certain... '

1380
01:57:58,771 --> 01:58:02,468
'... that I've gone
very far away from you.'

1381
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:06,872
'One man made a mistake
and two had to suffer.'

1382
01:58:07,947 --> 01:58:10,711
'For all my mistakes and all
the promises I didn't keep... '

1383
01:58:10,983 --> 01:58:12,041
'Please forgive me.'

1384
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:14,050
'And do me two favors.'

1385
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:16,852
'Tell Aakash that his father was...

1386
01:58:16,956 --> 01:58:19,447
...a good man caught up
in a bad situation.'

1387
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:22,794
'Who died fighting for
his love and his right.'

1388
01:58:23,863 --> 01:58:28,823
'And secondly, there is a
cheque enclosed with this letter.'

1389
01:58:29,435 --> 01:58:33,394
'Send half the amount to
Megha's brother and Aadil's mother.'

1390
01:58:34,474 --> 01:58:35,907
'And if we meet again
in the next life... '

1391
01:58:36,809 --> 01:58:40,370
'... I promise, that story
will have a beautiful ending.'

1392
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:42,404
'Until then... '

1393
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:44,474
'I love you.'

1394
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:28,689
"The road was leading ahead."

1395
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:34,931
"There was danger behind."

1396
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:47,138
"The road was leading ahead."

1397
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:53,583
"There was danger behind."

1398
01:59:53,886 --> 01:59:59,483
"Speedy sight said..."

1399
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:05,464
"...the one who got
scared was destroyed."

1400
02:00:05,565 --> 02:00:08,534
"It goes on fast and faster."

1401
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:11,536
"The game to fear of fear goes on."

1402
02:00:11,637 --> 02:00:16,836
"Everybody wants to win the race."

1403
02:00:16,943 --> 02:00:19,070
"Hey"

1404
02:00:19,545 --> 02:00:21,877
"Play with speed."

1405
02:00:21,981 --> 02:00:27,920
"Everybody... speed, speed, speed..."

1406
02:00:29,155 --> 02:00:31,180
"Play..."

1407
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:34,186
"Everybody plays."

1408
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:37,886
"Speed, speed, speed..."

1409
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:42,093
"Speed, speed..."

1410
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:59,146
"Speed, speed, speed..."

1411
02:01:00,052 --> 02:01:05,490
"Speed, speed, speed..."

1412
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:09,490
"Somewhere it is linked
and somewhere it turns."

1413
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:12,496
"The road is broken at places."

1414
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:15,659
"The land is lost. The world is lost."

1415
02:01:15,768 --> 02:01:18,794
"Relationships are lost."

1416
02:01:18,904 --> 02:01:24,536
"Life does not stop."

1417
02:01:24,977 --> 02:01:30,506
"Life does not stop."

1418
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:33,609
"It goes on fast and faster."

1419
02:01:33,719 --> 02:01:36,779
"The game to fear of fear goes on."

1420
02:01:36,856 --> 02:01:41,919
"Everybody wants to win the race."

1421
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:43,928
"Speed..."

1422
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:47,022
"Everybody... speed..."

1423
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:52,998
"Hey play..."
