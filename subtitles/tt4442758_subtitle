Take precautions while
travelling by road.

ln spite of our being careful,
still there could be many dangers.

10
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,715
Many people who had pinned their hopes
and lives on you...

We don,t understand what
life is unless it happens.

22

By looking at me, you understand that
someone has thrashed me badly, right?

23
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:53,039
Getting thrashed is
not a new thing for me.

Why do you get beaten
without beating him?

59

He is a policemanï Policemanï

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,156
Nine... ten..

68
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,194
Hey, why are you looking

00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:58,727

70
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,790
- l will quit.
- Quit?

71
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:06,902
l will wear...
l will wear police dress.

72
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:10,774
- l will become police.
- What will you become?

73
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,410
Do you know on whom
you are putting your hand?

74
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:20,484
To-be policeï

75
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,753
Remove the handï

76
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:39,304
,And then l became quite
determined to become police.,

77
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:42,303
,They said l should
study to become police.,

78
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:45,740
,l don,t have parents like
other for studying in school.,

79
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:50,383
,That,s why l worked during
the day and joined night school.,

80
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:53,815
,l wouldn,t study properly
but l want to become police.,

,l would see how luxurious
it is if l become policeman.,

82
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:59,057
Wrong route and moreover.

83
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,355
We can take Rs. 100
if there is no licence.

84
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,420
We can take half from the thief.

85
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,727
lf two people fight then
we can take from both.

86
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,268
Not only these,
we can trample anyone.

87
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:13,534
l used to practice dialogues too
by watching police movies at times.

88
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,435
,ln the neighbourhood
of this Kondaveeti...,

00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:21,072

,Heyï Heyï
lf you failed in first standard...,

94
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,522
,...then l studied degree.,

95
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:37,052
,lf there are bombs in your
house then l have guts inside me.,

96
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:40,464
,lf there is money in your pocket
then l have revolver in my pocket.,

97
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:43,094
,lf you take out this revolver
then it is illegal.,

98
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,762
,lf l take it out then it is legal.,

99
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,103
,lf you kill a person
then is called killing.,

100
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,267
,lf l kill then it is protection.,

101
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:52,312
,lf you twirl your moustache
then it is hooliganism...,

102
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:55,075
,...and if l twirl moustache
then it is heroism.,

103
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:03,017
,Shall we leave the station
and go to centre? Readyï,

104
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,485
,l am an lnspector
if l am wearing ,khaki, dress.,

105
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:07,993
,Otherwise l am a bigger goon than you.,

106
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:10,857
,Come onï
At which centre shall we fight?,

107
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,832
,Jagadamba? Market? Sangam? Tell meï,

108
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:14,959
Two idlisï

109
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,469
,Somehow l worked hard
and passed tenth standard.,

110
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:18,402
Heyï

111
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,997
Degree became very difficult after that.

112
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,973
,At one stage, l thought of giving up.,

113
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:27,844
,But every scam happening
in the country would inspire me.,

114
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:31,373
,l would feel sad by thinking
l am not there in it.,

115
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:36,620
,l wouldn,t sleep at nights by thinking
when l will grow and become police.,

116
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,690
Brother, l am unable to study.

117
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:42,591
They say it will take another five
years to finish degree. What to do?

118
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:46,224
Study. lf you work hard and study,
you will learn.

119
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,628
- What if l work hard and buy?
- What?

120
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,938
l will pay money and buy degree.

121
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:57,006
,Finally l bought the degree
by taking help from few people.,

122
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:59,773
,Only physical test l passed genuinely.,

123
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,214
,Finally, either because of
my good luck or your bad luck...,

124
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:06,809
,...l became Sub-lnspectorï,

125
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:12,518
,Jai Hindï,

Stopï Stopï

128
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,306
- Heyï
- Where will you run?

129
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,575
Why are you standing
there and watching? Come.

130
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:05,168
Why did God give the sea?

131
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,213
- For fishes?
- lsn,t it?

132
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:09,439
We go in boat to catch them.

133
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,882
Anyway we go so we
bring something in them.

134
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:14,716
Why does police call it smuggling?
Not only that...

135
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:16,517
...they are arresting
our boys every now and then.

136
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,455
That Sl arrested my brother today.

137
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:19,992
lt will take five minutes to kill him.

138
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,187
But they will bring another
strict officer if he gets killed.

139
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:23,560
l don,t want that.

140
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:28,658
Look, remove him and replace
him with the Sl who listens to me.

141
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:32,201
He shouldn,t have morality. He shouldn,t
know what honesty and sincerity.

142
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:35,742
ln short, he should be worse than me.

143
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:40,475
Worst than you is difficult, buddyï

144
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:45,918
Yesï There is oneï He is in Hyderabad.

145
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,989

then he belongs to different category.

00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,777
So why did you run after seeing me?

154
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:26,853
l am very much frightened of police.
l thought you must be police.

- Sir... sir.

156

The fear inside you
has made me police.

Heyï You?

162
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,874
Sorry, sir.
l didn,t think you will become police.

163

- Anyway, who was it running just now?

00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:53,310
- Don,t know? Youï
- l really don,t know.

- Where is the dead body?
- l will show you.

170

His gang and Shakeel,s
gang are at loggerheads.

00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:15,693
Shakeel,s gang tried to
kill him many times but failed.

We should keep such people inside.
We shouldn,t let them out.

00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:53,531
Sir, you only said to open the cell.

Hold it.

00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:52,571
Your parrot is nice.

416
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:54,401
This is not parrot. lt is macau.

00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,234
- ls it?
- Yes.

418
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:58,509
We call it macau. Does it know?

419
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:00,972
- lt doesn,t know.
- That is the problem.

420
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,048
Fishes don,t know
that we call them as fish.

421
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:04,845
Donkeys don,t know that
we call them as donkeys.

422
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,077
True.

423
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:07,619
- What is your name?
- Sanvi.

424
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:09,985
- Not its name.. your name.
- lt is my name.

425
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:12,114
Oh... so what is her name?

- He?
- Yes.

428
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,391
Now l have a doubt.

429
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,194
How do we know
if it is male or female?

430
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:24,535
Noï Not like our humans. lf we conduct
DNA test then we will know...

431
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:26,003
...whether it is male or female.

432
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:28,597
We know it if we conduct
DNA test but how do they know it.

433
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,835
They remember it naturally.

434
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,276
Feelings start automatically
after seeing each other.

435
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:35,041
Male will come after seeing female.

436
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:37,740
- So like us?
- Yes.

00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:39,250

We will meet whenever you come.

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,947
- Okay. Bye.
- Right. Bye.

451
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,755
Wait, l will bring a female to Bobby.

452
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:21,623
He will go behind her
and you will come behind him.

453
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:26,029
Look, Murthy.

457
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:39,100
She says she is an animal lover, Murthy.
Who is the animal here other than me?

00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:41,112
Go and find the details and set her.

459
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,709
Sir, l am not such a person.

Murthy, l am like that only.
What shall we do now?

461
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:48,682
Listen to me and go.
Set her... set her.

462
00:31:49,622 --> 00:31:51,180

She? Why do you want her, brother?

524
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:18,634
She puts chain around the dogs
but not on her neck.

525
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:20,262
Listen to meï

526
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:23,971

Orphan dogsï
Brother, they are very mild.

Our God trusted us and

00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,190
We have to complete this mission.

543
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:21,393
What shall we do now?

544
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:23,801
Thorn should be removed with a thorn.

545
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,100
- Bite the dog like a dogï
- Means?

546
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:29,941

How is your Bobby?

554
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:56,497
Not Bobby, last night thieves entered
my house and took all my babies.

555
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:58,729
- Babies?
- Children, sir.

556
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:00,396
- Do you have children?
- Oh noï

557
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:02,600

- Dogs theft?
- Yes.

560
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:10,344
Sir, someone has done it deliberately.

561
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,145
They have targeted with a purpose.

562
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:15,210
Sanvi, they will do with a purpose.
Who will do for nothing?

563
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:16,549
There is market for
it so they have done it.

564
00:36:17,223 --> 00:36:18,349
What market?

565
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:19,549
Don,t you know?

566
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:22,719
These days Koreans are eating
dogs by leaving chicken and mutton.

567
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:24,796
- Godï
- By the way...

568
00:36:24,864 --> 00:36:26,422

569
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:27,599
What?

570
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,657
Will Koreans eat my babies?

571
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:31,836
What is wrong with them, sir?

572
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:33,667

573
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:35,798

574
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:38,335

00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:43,108
Sirï Sirï Oppa Gangnam Styleï

577
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:51,152
Recently we attended
a Korean food festival here.

578
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:53,020
We even talked to chefs.

579
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:55,890
- Yes, mother?
- Those rascals looked good at that time.

580
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,429
What happened to them
during this time, sir?

581
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:00,021
Yes, their days are numbered.

582
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,260
l think by now they might
have been shipped to Korea.

583
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:05,629
Shipping?
Sir, Korea is very far, isn,t it?

584
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:06,830
Where do you think Korea is?

585
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:07,906
From Vizag, if we go in boat...

586
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:09,497
...to north then you will get North Korea,
if you go to south then South Korea.

587
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,599
So should l go this side
or that side in boat?

588
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,473
Why will you go?
Do you think l am dead?

00:39:25,644 --> 00:39:28,272
Grandmother,
yesterday is yesterday for us.

00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:29,814
For Koreans,
yesterday means day before yesterday.

Sir, l thought music class.

00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,366
They called up and
offered good payment.

770
00:45:32,444 --> 00:45:34,275
l came searching address using GPRS.

771
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:36,575
l didn,t know it is a brothel house.

772
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:39,207
Anyway, is this the location where
romantic people and drunkards come?

773
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:41,511
Ohï What do you think of us?

774
00:45:41,586 --> 00:45:43,713

- Don,t you know club dance?
- No, sir.

779
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:53,697
Don,t you know?
Rascalï You are doing the sameï

780
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:55,664
ln the last night raid
in brothel house...

781
00:45:55,734 --> 00:45:59,067
...a flutist by name Vennela Kishore
was caught red handed.

782
00:45:59,171 --> 00:46:01,002
The culture association
responded immediately...

783
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,667
...and banned his musical programs
all over the state.

784
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:08,007
Rascalï Had l trusted you
and got my daughter married to you...

785
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,444
...my daughter,s life
would have been destroyed.

786
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,722
Forget what has happened?

787
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:25,422
l think he is your to-be son-in-law.
You don,t worry.

788
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,088
l will see that no cases are filed.

789
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:28,393
You get your daughter married to him.

790
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:32,301
What should l do? l thought he
will sing solo songs with my daughter.

791
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:36,935
How do l know he likes
group songs and item songs?

792
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:39,340
Aunt, you are getting it wrong.
They have called me.

793
00:46:39,444 --> 00:46:41,412
They said they will give good payment
if l do solo performance.

794
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:43,947
- Will they make payment to you in return?
- Yes.

795
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:46,245
What is the payment made at midnight?

796
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:48,513
- Aunt, it is not that.
- Who is your aunt?

797
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,145

798
00:46:51,256 --> 00:46:53,156
- Leave it, mom.
- What should l listen to?

799
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:55,250
l listened to you and
agreed for this marriage.

800
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,522
You said he is very good. Now see.

801
00:46:57,596 --> 00:46:58,995
Aunt, l am a good person.

802
00:46:59,097 --> 00:47:01,998
Hey, if you call me aunt again then
l,ll make you bite with dogs. Be carefulï

803
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,762
- Aunt.
- No, sir.. You?

804
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,634
You will not ruin your life by getting
your daughter married to him, right?

805
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:09,105
- You have clarity?
- Absolutely.

806
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:10,970
- You leave.
- Sir, it is not that.

807
00:47:11,877 --> 00:47:13,242
- My fiancée, sir.
- Leaveï

808
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:15,677
- Sanvi, l will call and tell you..
- What will you call?

809
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:17,112
Sanvi, l will tell everything
that happened.

810
00:47:17,215 --> 00:47:18,182
What will you convince here?

811
00:47:19,317 --> 00:47:21,581
l will kill you
if you are seen near her.

812
00:47:21,653 --> 00:47:22,551
- Goï
- Sir, it is not that.

813
00:47:22,654 --> 00:47:25,282
lf you again stop or meet her,
you will die.

814
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,782
Anyway why do you get married to
the person who beats dogs with stones?

815
00:47:28,527 --> 00:47:30,757
What? Does he beat dogs with stones?

816
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:33,297
Yesï He wakes up the
sleeping dog and beats it.

817
00:47:33,365 --> 00:47:35,333
My blood boils by watching his deeds.

818
00:47:37,436 --> 00:47:39,700
Do you like dogs so much?

819
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:41,129
Like?

820
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:43,500
l was born in the midst of dogs,
l grew up with dogs...

821
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:45,008
...l worked in dogs, chemist.

822
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:47,010
What do you think a dog is?

823
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:51,280
Only dog loves us unconditionally.

824
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:55,051
lt loves human,s
more than fellow dogs.

825
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,884
Leave all that. We even search
for dogs in humans. Do you know?

826
00:47:57,989 --> 00:47:59,081
Dog like husband who obeys his husband...

827
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:00,681
...dog like wife who takes her
husband,s abuses.

828
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:03,123
Dog like driver, dog like maid.

829
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:06,925
Whether we are at home or not, dog like
old woman like her who guards the house.

830
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:10,196
These are not sufficient
and so we bring another dog.

831
00:48:13,538 --> 00:48:16,871
Sanvi, humans don,t need humanity.
They need dog,s behaviour.

832
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:19,206
,Dog,s behaviourï Dog,s behaviourï,

833
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:21,541
Look, if l were to marry...

834
00:48:21,947 --> 00:48:23,346
...l will become a dog to my wife...

835
00:48:23,448 --> 00:48:26,110
...and l will turn my wife into a dog.

836
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:28,317
Yesï

837
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:53,072
,,l fell on the spot
after watching you.,,

838
00:48:53,144 --> 00:48:56,272
,,l forgot myself on the spot.,,

839
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:02,681
,,l fell on the spot
after watching you.,,

840
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:05,848
,,l forgot myself on the spot.,,

841
00:49:05,957 --> 00:49:08,653
,,Like some magic
happened on the spot.,,

842
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,255
,,l fell for your words on the spot.,,

843
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:18,261
,,What have you done to me?,,

844
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,362
,,l don,t understand it at any cost.,,

845
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:27,842
,,You killed me by pulling and pinching
my heart.. you made me love you.,,

846
00:49:27,946 --> 00:49:31,473
,,One more time,
baby, one more time.,,

847
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,610
,,Tell the same word one more time.,,

848
00:49:34,686 --> 00:49:37,814
,,One more time,
baby, one more time.,,

849
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:42,849
,,Tell the same word one more time.,,

850
00:49:43,295 --> 00:49:50,633
,,One more time.,,

851
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:01,869
,,On the spot.,,

852
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:04,638
Yesterday Ceylon Subbarao came,
so l asked him.

853
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:07,317
He says there is only two hours difference
is there between them and us.

854
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:09,148
Grandmother,
that was before Korea got split.

855
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:10,585
Timings have changed
after they got split.

856
00:50:10,655 --> 00:50:13,681
- So why did Subbarao tell me like that?
- What does Ceylon Subbarao know?

857
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:15,726
He went to Ceylon. l went to Korea.

858
00:50:15,794 --> 00:50:17,887
Tell him to meet me once.
l will tell him Korea timings.

859
00:50:17,963 --> 00:50:19,954
Oh Godï Why does he shout like this?

860
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:21,123
Why doesn,t he tell that slowly?

861
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:26,461
,,You have hurt me with your eyes.,,

862
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:33,338
,,You have gestured with
lips and disturbed my sleep.,,

863
00:50:33,445 --> 00:50:39,179
,,My heart played swinging with you.,,

864
00:50:39,818 --> 00:50:48,283
,,Oh dear, l liked you in many ways.,,

865
00:50:53,098 --> 00:50:56,261
,,l fell on the spot
after watching you.,,

866
00:50:56,334 --> 00:50:59,098
,,l forgot myself on the spot.,,

867
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:09,606
Sir, for how many days
should l come like this?

868
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:12,582
l am shouting daily saying
my daughter is missing.

869
00:51:12,684 --> 00:51:14,777
But no police is reacting.

870
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,486
Who is Arun?

871
00:51:17,756 --> 00:51:19,121
Who is Arun?

872
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,522
My daughter,s friend.
They study together.

873
00:51:21,593 --> 00:51:23,993
- Where he stays?
- He stays at Gajuwaka.

874
00:51:24,062 --> 00:51:26,257
His house is behind
Yellamma temple in Gajuwaka.

875
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:28,891
He too is missing from
the day your daughter is missing.

876
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:30,958
Do you understand what happened?

877
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:33,334
Your daughter eloped with him.

878
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:37,302
They will return once his money and
your daughter,s jewellery are spent.

879
00:51:37,742 --> 00:51:39,039
Goï

880
00:51:40,045 --> 00:51:42,741
They shout unnecessarily at police
but don,t know to look after children.

881
00:51:43,214 --> 00:51:44,943
We will inform after finding.

882
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:48,516
- Hello.
- Friend.

883
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:51,447
- Tell me the matter.
- His name is Thota Venkat Rao.

884
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,248
He has a mangrove.

885
00:51:53,525 --> 00:51:55,925
l want it. l tried by threatening him.

886
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:58,059
He acted in haste and
informed the collector.

887
00:51:58,797 --> 00:52:01,163
My work should be done.

888
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,801
Murthy, take out the vehicle.

889
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:14,771
When did you buy the property, sir?

890
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:16,336
- 25 years ago.
- Ohï

891
00:52:16,414 --> 00:52:18,382
- How much it costed at that time?
- Two lakhs.

892
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,915
- Sir, what is the price in market now.
- lt is around five crores.

893
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:23,814
Ohï lt has increased a lot.
Wonderfulï Goodï

894
00:52:23,988 --> 00:52:25,819
So why are you not selling
when Voltaire Vasu is asking?

895
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,381
He threatened many
times to sell for 50 lakhs.

896
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:30,456
Anyway l don,t have
any intention to sell.

897
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:32,389
l have kept it for my granddaughter.

898
00:52:32,497 --> 00:52:34,124
Sir, your son will give
to your granddaughter.

899
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:35,826
Why do you take that tension?

900
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:38,501
My son and daughter-in-law
died in accident.

901
00:52:39,304 --> 00:52:41,169
Only l am there for my granddaughter.

902
00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:44,332
But why does Voltaire Vasu say papers
are with him and plot belongs to him.

903
00:52:45,276 --> 00:52:47,107
Sir, original papers are with me.

904
00:52:47,178 --> 00:52:49,408
But he too is showing
original papers, sir.

905
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:51,672
lf he goes to court by carrying
them then you too should go.

906
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:53,441
Will this matter get
settled anytime soon?

907
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:56,146
Will your granddaughter enjoy
the money from this property?

908
00:52:56,588 --> 00:53:01,116
Listen to me.
He is saying he will give 50, sign it.

909
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,126
Sir, this costs five crores.

910
00:53:05,597 --> 00:53:08,259
Sir, is it important than
your granddaughter,s life?

911
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,092
Five crores?

912
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:12,000
You know how big fool he is.

913
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:15,599
What if he kidnaps the
girl and keeps her somewhere?

914
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:18,005
What if he kills her?
Sir, why should we take these tensions?

915
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,175
Sign it.

916
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:24,103
Sir, understand what l am saying.

917
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:26,444
Sign it.

918
00:53:30,722 --> 00:53:32,781
Sir, someone has kidnapped the girl.

919
00:53:34,025 --> 00:53:38,155
Didn,t l tell you? Didn,t l tell you
that something like this will happen?

920
00:53:38,396 --> 00:53:40,455
Sir, they will kill the girl.

921
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,795
lf something happens to the girl
then neither you nor l can save her.

922
00:53:43,902 --> 00:53:46,496
Why do you need the property
that will kill your granddaughter?

923
00:53:46,738 --> 00:53:48,569
Listen to me and sign it.
Murthy, give the paper.

924
00:53:48,673 --> 00:53:50,197
Sign it, sir. Sign.

925
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:53,301
Sir, please understand
what l am saying.

926
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:56,312
Let us save the girl. Sign it.

927
00:54:56,274 --> 00:54:59,175
Cheating, sir... lnjustice, sir.

928
00:54:59,677 --> 00:55:02,908
Sir, how did you feel
like cheating the old man?

929
00:55:03,248 --> 00:55:06,240
ls this is not called a cold
blooded murder then what is it, sir.

930
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:10,213
Sir, don,t you feel anything?

931
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:12,222
- Don,t you have conscience?
- l have saved.

932
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,155
Otherwise they would have killed.

933
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:15,749
ln return l got 50 lakhs for him.

934
00:55:15,827 --> 00:55:17,761
There is one such angle, Murthy.
Why don,t you think?

935
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:21,560
Ohï ls there a reason
to your foolish deeds?

936
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:25,367
Sir, this is not correct.
You are committing mistake.

937
00:55:25,436 --> 00:55:28,030
Being a police officer,
for a loafer.

938
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:30,967
You are supporting Voltaire Vasu.

939
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:32,771
l am seeing from childhood.

940
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:34,367
He is a big criminal.

941
00:55:34,479 --> 00:55:36,845
lsn,t it? You are seeing him, right?

942
00:55:37,115 --> 00:55:38,548
You know he is a criminal.

943
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:40,550
You and he are staying
here since 25 years.

944
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:42,279
So why don,t you kill him?

945
00:55:42,654 --> 00:55:44,554
Take the gun. Go and shoot him.

946
00:55:45,857 --> 00:55:48,325
What will happen to you in return?
You will get hanged.

947
00:55:48,393 --> 00:55:51,089
Die. The justice that
you believe in will survive.

948
00:55:52,797 --> 00:55:56,995
lf you can do it then do.
Otherwise shut up and keep quiet.

949
00:55:57,068 --> 00:55:58,296
Don,t shout unnecessarily.

950
00:55:58,403 --> 00:56:00,803
Stay on that side or this side.

951
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,833
People like you who stay in between
are not of any benefit to the country...

952
00:56:03,942 --> 00:56:06,706
...or your family, Murthyï

953
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:11,411
Justice, honesty, country,
patriotism... stop the nuisanceï

954
00:56:11,516 --> 00:56:12,642
Learn to count
how many bundles of...

955
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:14,446
...500 and 1000 currency notes
are there in that bag.

956
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:17,511
Ughï lt is illegal moneyï
l will not touch it.

957
00:56:18,323 --> 00:56:21,986
Look... look,
this is your note and this is mine.

958
00:56:22,293 --> 00:56:24,090
This is justice and this is injustice.

959
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:26,297
Here... l have crushed them together.

960
00:56:26,597 --> 00:56:27,689
Tell meï Tell meï

961
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:30,131
Tell me which is your note and mine.

962
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:32,460
Tell me, Murthyï

963
00:56:33,471 --> 00:56:36,702
Murthy, the honesty inside
you is not there in this note.

964
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,373
Don,t shoutï

965
00:56:39,477 --> 00:56:42,412
The first witness for every injustice
that happens in the country.

966
00:56:43,147 --> 00:56:46,548
They have kept..
they have kept a photo on this.

967
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:51,946
Here... keep it... keep it and...

968
00:56:52,023 --> 00:56:54,321
- ...take that bag home.
- l don,t want.

969
00:56:55,259 --> 00:56:58,717
Okay, you are my bank.
l am depositing them with you. Keep it.

970
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:03,397
Heyï lt will be good
if a tsunami comes...

971
00:57:03,468 --> 00:57:05,493
...and you get drowned.

972
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,504
lt will be good if you dieï

973
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:11,705
Callï Call... call which
tsunami you will call... callï

974
00:57:12,043 --> 00:57:15,535
Pray to the God you worship.
l will sit here all nightï

975
00:57:15,613 --> 00:57:18,343
Yesï Tell the tsunami to come.
l will take it.

976
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,375
Murthy, it will not
come for me specially.

977
00:57:21,886 --> 00:57:23,285
When it comes, you, me...

978
00:57:23,354 --> 00:57:26,323
...Voltaire Vasu, old man,
his granddaughter and everyone will die.

979
00:57:26,824 --> 00:57:29,315
lt has no confusions like you and me.
lt has more clarity.

980
00:57:29,427 --> 00:57:32,191
lt will come, drown us and carry us.

981
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:35,490
Tsunami? Tsunami.

982
00:57:35,566 --> 00:57:37,466
l will sit here. Tell it comeï

983
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,394
Why doesn,t it come?

984
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:44,998
You are talking as
if l committed rapes or murders.

985
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:47,907
Why do you join the
department for nuisance.

986
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:56,283
Father.

987
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:01,948
Today is the last day.

988
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:05,462
lf l don,t pay the fees then
they will not allow me to write exams.

989
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:08,227
They will remove me from college.

990
00:58:15,106 --> 00:58:18,564
Use that money if you need anything.
l will not feel anything.

991
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:22,308
- How much has to be paid?
- 40,000.

992
00:58:22,413 --> 00:58:24,608
Dear, your father doesn,t
have so much money.

993
00:58:25,383 --> 00:58:28,750
Why should you wait till
they remove you? You quit college.

994
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:31,616
You quit college.

995
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:35,856
All the police families are doing well.
Only we are crying like this.

996
00:58:36,194 --> 00:58:39,925
Mother,s bad luck. You are born to a
father who couldn,t educate his daughter.

997
00:58:40,665 --> 00:58:43,327
People like you who stay in between
are not of any benefit to the country...

998
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:45,994
...or your family, Murthy.

999
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:51,901
Heyï

1000
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:02,547
Hiï

1001
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,115
- Happy birthdayï
- Thank you.

1002
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:09,989
Tell me. Ask me what you want.

1003
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:12,427
Will anyone ask like that?
You should give something.

1004
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:13,292
What should l give?

1005
00:59:13,364 --> 00:59:15,832
lf you don,t like what l give you now
then where should l keep it.

1006
00:59:16,134 --> 00:59:18,125
These saris and all...
l can,t do all that.

1007
00:59:19,537 --> 00:59:22,734
Mobiles? TV's? Electronic gadgets?

1008
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,070
Tell me anything from these smuggled
items. They will come in five minutes.

1009
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:27,234
l will ask if l want.

1010
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:31,008
But please don,t take
me in police jeep today.

1011
00:59:31,115 --> 00:59:33,640
Please. lt is minimum
common sense to bring a bike...

1012
00:59:33,718 --> 00:59:36,346
...when you take your
girl friend to movie.

1013
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,547
Correct... correct... correct...
what shall we do now?

1014
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,853
Why don,t l stop someone?
He is correct.

1015
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:44,553
Heyï Stopï Stopï Stopï Stopï Policeï

1016
00:59:44,629 --> 00:59:45,721
l have all papers.

1017
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,628
Who wants your papers? l want your bike.
Get down... get down...get down.

1018
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:49,791

- Why do you want? Get downï

1020
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:54,061
Talking of chase?

1021
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:56,297
Hey, come to the station
in the evening and take your bike.

1022
00:59:56,374 --> 00:59:58,239
- So what should l take now?
- Use my vehicle.

1023
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:00,209
Use my jeep... use it nicely.

1024
01:00:00,278 --> 01:00:02,746
- You sit.
- Sit, madam. Sit.

1025
01:00:02,847 --> 01:00:05,111
Hey, fill the tank and

01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:06,114
Full tank?

1027
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,781
Who is he?

1028
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,411
There are dogs in
your department, right?

1029
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:14,216
They are very trained
and intelligent, right?

1030
01:00:14,325 --> 01:00:15,758
Hmm.

1031
01:00:16,694 --> 01:00:18,753
We asked many times. They didn,t give.

1032
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:20,592
Our dogs are to be bred.

1033
01:00:20,698 --> 01:00:23,098
Will you arrange for it?

1034
01:00:23,734 --> 01:00:27,295
lt has been long time...
nobody cares for us.

1035
01:00:27,371 --> 01:00:29,271
lf dogs need it, you ask it decently.

1036
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:31,307
When we ask for it,
they look at us like dogs.

1037
01:00:31,742 --> 01:00:33,505
Let us set something.

1038
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:35,603
Don,t know this world.

1039
01:00:36,013 --> 01:00:38,311

We shouldn,t eat all
these if it is not there.

01:00:57,835 --> 01:00:59,826
- So should l eat?
- Noï

1049
01:00:59,904 --> 01:01:02,964
Anyway they are dead. lf they are thrown
into the sea again, sea will get dirty.

1050
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:06,271
You wait.

She is my life.

My girl friend.

1081
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,858

You come to the guest house.

1086
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,294
Sanvi, you don,t take any tension.

1087
01:03:45,703 --> 01:03:48,695
Tell your family members
that you fell down from bike.

1088
01:03:49,473 --> 01:03:50,770
Don,t fear.

1089
01:03:51,776 --> 01:03:53,107
Go and sleep.

1090
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,155
When did you come? What happened?

1091
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,091
l couldn,t sleep all night.

1092
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:20,494
lt happened by mistake. Forget it.

1093
01:04:23,174 --> 01:04:25,938
They tried to kill me by thinking
of me to be some other girl.

1094
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:28,441
But had they killed.

1095
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:31,078
What would have happened to you?

1096
01:04:31,148 --> 01:04:34,481
My mother, grandmother and our life..
what would have happened.

1097
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:36,315
Nothing happened now.

1098
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,911
Forget it as a nightmare.

1099
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:44,558
What if the girl they
are looking for is found?

1100
01:04:45,362 --> 01:04:46,886
They will kill her, isn,t it?

1101
01:04:48,899 --> 01:04:50,560
She has a life.

1102
01:04:51,101 --> 01:04:52,591
She must be having a family, right?

1103
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:55,897
lt is a mistake to kill a person, right?

1104
01:04:58,142 --> 01:05:02,545
l couldn,t sleep all night
by thinking of that girl.

1105
01:05:03,214 --> 01:05:05,045
l have been crying.

1106
01:05:07,818 --> 01:05:10,048
Daya, l don,t know who that girl is.

1107
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:12,411
But she should live.

1108
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:17,087
You should save her
as a sincere police officer.

1109
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:22,796
Her life is the birthday
gift that you will give me.

1110
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:27,528
Sanviï

1111
01:05:29,507 --> 01:05:32,408
He is a friend and she is girl friend.

1112
01:05:32,476 --> 01:05:35,070
l don,t know the
girl whom l should save.

1113
01:05:35,946 --> 01:05:37,436
Where are you?

1114
01:07:10,774 --> 01:07:12,298
Why are you here?

1115
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:14,377
l told you to come
to the guest house, right?

1116
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:20,714
Keep this gun with you.

1117
01:07:21,352 --> 01:07:23,513
lf anybody comes closer, shoot them.

1118
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:26,146
Heyï Heyï
Why are you giving the gun to her?

1119
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:28,750
Because of this girl,
your girl friend was beaten.

1120
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:30,417
- Leave this girlï
- What?

1121
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:32,562
Leave this girl, brother.

1122
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:35,197
Why? ls she too your girl friend?

1123
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:37,597
lf something happens to her
then my love will become a problem.

1124
01:07:37,668 --> 01:07:39,033
Problem only to your love.

1125
01:07:39,103 --> 01:07:40,832
lf l leave her then
it is a problem to my life.

1126
01:07:40,938 --> 01:07:42,269
Heyï Bring herï

1127

Didn,t l tell not to touch?

1129
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,327
Why did you show a new angle?

1130
01:08:08,966 --> 01:08:10,490
There are many more angles.

1131
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:14,560
Ohï Hey, there are
four dogs in my farm house.

1132
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:17,568
l give them pedigree and money to you.
That is the only difference.

1133
01:08:18,942 --> 01:08:21,536
Will you answer back to me?

1134
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:32,216
You have touched the wrong point.

1135
01:08:32,556 --> 01:08:36,151
Didn,t l already tell you
that ego surrounds me like wifi?

1136
01:08:36,593 --> 01:08:38,220

You are villain and l am hero.

1144

Your time has started.

Only Vizag will be there,
Vasu will not be there in it.

1149
01:10:03,914 --> 01:10:07,077

- With me.. will you fight with me?
- Heyï

1152
01:10:14,124 --> 01:10:18,060
lf two people fight with me then
it is war. lf one attacks alone...

1153
01:10:18,428 --> 01:10:21,488
...then it is attack.
This is Daya,s attack.

1154
01:11:07,711 --> 01:11:10,805
Brother, he is not in the station and
not in the house. What shall we do now?

1155
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:12,314
Call him.

1156
01:11:16,486 --> 01:11:17,748
He is disconnecting it.

1158
01:11:19,256 --> 01:11:20,780

You are villain, l am hero.

1163
01:11:39,476 --> 01:11:42,309
Murthy, l talked a lot.

1164
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:46,641
Murthy, everyone has ego.

1165
01:11:46,717 --> 01:11:48,912
Why should it be only to me like wifi?

1166
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,318
Why should only l talk anything?

1167
01:11:53,056 --> 01:11:54,614
He talked to the minister and...

1168
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:56,625
...brought here from some other place.

1169
01:11:56,693 --> 01:11:58,024
Murthy, do you know
what rubbish l talked?

1170
01:11:58,128 --> 01:12:01,894

l will make you lose your sleep.
l will sleep in your heart.

1173
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:11,867
He gave me a beautiful
flat for me to sleep.

1174
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:15,411
Murthy, why should l sleep in his heart
as if there is no place anywhere?

1175
01:12:15,812 --> 01:12:16,744
Will he not get hurt?

1176
01:12:16,813 --> 01:12:20,044
Attackï This is Daya,s attack.

1177
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:23,142
What is that word attack, Murthy?

1178
01:12:23,353 --> 01:12:26,379
l didn,t read it anywhere..
l didn,t watch in any movie.

1179
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:29,789
How do you think this word
came to my mouth? l lost my controlï

1180
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:34,454
Murthy, he is a good person.
Had it been me, l would have killed.

1181
01:12:34,631 --> 01:12:37,259
Attack? Attack? My hellï

01:12:37,668 --> 01:12:38,532
- Heyï

1183
01:12:38,635 --> 01:12:40,535

Ours is not a challenge

They say you don,t take

Forget what happened.

1212
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:01,310
l came to make you both compromise.

1213
01:14:01,385 --> 01:14:03,080
Poor boyï See how he is repenting.

1214

Poor kidï
Take him closer and console him.

1220
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:17,925
You both hug... hug each other.

1221
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:20,026
Come.. come.

1222
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:24,103
Don,t smell me. l feel irritated.

Ahï He bit meï He bit meï

Will you take revenge on me?

Wrong..

1231
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,190
Hey, you stop.
He is changing the topic.

1232
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:54,703
- Tell me. Where is the girl?
- Look.

1233
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:56,668
l never called anyone as brother.
l called only you.

1234
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,833
So will you declare
war on this brother?

1235
01:14:58,942 --> 01:15:00,409
Who started it? You or me?

1236
01:15:00,844 --> 01:15:02,835
You must have started. Otherwise
why will the boy say like that?

1237
01:15:02,946 --> 01:15:04,379
Who? ls he a boy?

1238
01:15:04,448 --> 01:15:05,972
He said he will give
life for friendship.

1239
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:07,243
Didn,t l give?

1240
01:15:07,951 --> 01:15:10,317
Where did l fire? l fired somewhere
in the air? Did l fire in your heart?

1241
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:12,047
What does it mean?

1242
01:15:12,122 --> 01:15:14,716

Should l do that?

1250
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:35,109
Should we call elder brother like that?
Aren,t you my elder brother?

1251
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:37,203
Should we call brother as sir?

1252
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:38,975
Why did he become
like this nowadays, sir?

1253
01:15:39,049 --> 01:15:42,610
Why do you have so much ego?
Why do you get so angry? Youï

1254
01:15:43,787 --> 01:15:46,221
Yes, Vasu.

Everything after drinking.

1259
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:54,261
Sit and drink.

Where is Laxmi?

Who is Laxmi?

1263
01:16:08,645 --> 01:16:10,704
You beat us and took her away.

1264
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,145
Ohï ls her name Laxmi?

1265
01:16:12,215 --> 01:16:13,580
So don,t you even know the name?

her for gift. l took and gave her.

1267
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:17,678
Who is your girl friend?

Let anything happen to Laxmi,

1273
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,565
You are important to me.

1274
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:34,570
lf l am important then l want Laxmi.

1275
01:16:34,838 --> 01:16:35,964
Who is he, sir?

1276
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,763
Why does he talk about girl

Hello, stop drinking.

What is the benefit that

What happened? Brothers got separated.

1284

You don,t know the matter.
You come by carrying a towelï Ughï

Hey, you don,t seem to understand
the seriousness in matter.

1344
01:22:24,654 --> 01:22:27,452
You must be thinking that you will
save her because your girl friend asked.

1345
01:22:27,957 --> 01:22:29,686
My brothers, lives..

1346

01:22:42,305 --> 01:22:44,705
You want girl or proof?

01:22:48,211 --> 01:22:50,702
- Will you leave her?
- Will she give you?

1355
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:56,719
lf she trusts anybody on
this earth now then it is me.

1356
01:22:57,887 --> 01:23:00,082
l will bring. Leave her.

1357
01:23:01,858 --> 01:23:03,450
My situation too is the same.

1358
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,958
lf l trust anybody
in this earth then...

1359
01:23:07,163 --> 01:23:08,790
...it is only you.

1360
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:11,160
My brothers, lives...

1361
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:13,726
l am leaving by trusting you.

1362
01:23:18,308 --> 01:23:20,833
- Murthy, take out the vehicle.
- Sir, what you are doing is wrong.

1363
01:23:21,044 --> 01:23:23,012
Cheating, sir. Don,t cheat that girl.

1364
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:25,479
Stop, Murthyï Don,t irritate me.

1365
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:27,013
Do as l say.

1366
01:23:28,418 --> 01:23:29,851
ls your fear lost?

1367
01:23:30,286 --> 01:23:32,982
You are crying since the time you came
but you are not telling what happened.

1368
01:23:33,323 --> 01:23:35,689
What happened? Who are they?

1369
01:23:36,025 --> 01:23:39,426
lf you trust me that l will
remove your problem then tell me.

1370
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:45,229
l work in New York.

1371
01:23:45,635 --> 01:23:47,796
Mother and sister stay here.

1372
01:23:48,171 --> 01:23:51,038
l came to lndian to see them.

1373
01:23:51,975 --> 01:23:56,207
Sister should have come
to the airport to receive me...

1374
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:57,879
...she didn,t come.

1375
01:23:58,815 --> 01:24:03,149
Don,t know what happened.
Mother and l searched extensively.

1376
01:24:04,287 --> 01:24:05,948
We didn,t know her whereabouts.

1377
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:09,190
One day we received a call.

1378
01:24:11,294 --> 01:24:14,491
Sister, l don,t know whether l will
stay alive or not by the time you come.

1379
01:24:14,731 --> 01:24:16,460
- Where are you?
- Don,t know.

1380
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,532
l was coming to the airport for you...

1381
01:24:19,602 --> 01:24:22,901
...brothers of Voltaire
Vasu brought me here.

1382
01:24:22,972 --> 01:24:24,371
Sister, l have seen hell.

1383
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:27,275
They said they will kill me today.

1384
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:30,043
Kill you?
What are you talking, Deepti?

1385
01:24:30,113 --> 01:24:31,774
Sister, you don,t know.

1386
01:24:31,848 --> 01:24:34,339
Death is much better
than these people.

1387
01:24:34,717 --> 01:24:37,447
They had shot everything
in video camera.

1388
01:24:38,054 --> 01:24:41,251
l have seen them keeping
that CD in lorry.

1389
01:24:41,491 --> 01:24:42,856
Phone too is not mine.

1390
01:24:46,996 --> 01:24:48,327
l am sending GPS.

1391
01:24:48,531 --> 01:24:50,624
Heyï Whom are you calling?

1392
01:24:50,933 --> 01:24:54,130
After that l went to
the address sent by Deepti.

1393
01:25:00,643 --> 01:25:02,042
Deeptiï

1394
01:25:15,692 --> 01:25:17,956
They killed my sister, sir.

1395
01:25:19,629 --> 01:25:24,430
Sir, Vasu,s brothers have
raped and killed my sister.

1396
01:25:27,403 --> 01:25:29,701
l trusted a media person by mistake...

1397
01:25:29,772 --> 01:25:32,172
...and told about the CD.

1398
01:25:32,675 --> 01:25:36,133
He is Voltaire Vasu,s man.
He cheated me.

1399
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:40,505
After that l got
frightened to tell anybody.

1400
01:25:41,718 --> 01:25:43,413
And then you saved me.

1401
01:25:44,487 --> 01:25:46,921
- Does mother have American Visa?
- Yes.

1402
01:25:47,256 --> 01:25:49,656
Then give me the CD and
go to America with mother.

1403
01:25:51,794 --> 01:25:54,763
Do you trust me? Do you trust me?

1404
01:25:55,098 --> 01:25:57,623
- l trust you.
- Come, let us go home.

1405
01:26:06,809 --> 01:26:09,778
Don,t tell this matter to mother.
She doesn,t know anything.

1406
01:26:10,113 --> 01:26:13,048
She says police told her
that Deepti eloped with some boy.

1407
01:26:13,816 --> 01:26:15,181
Mother believes it.

1408
01:26:26,763 --> 01:26:29,459
Sir, my daughter is
missing from four days.

1409
01:26:31,801 --> 01:26:33,860
Sir, did you get any
information about my Deepti?

1410
01:26:35,772 --> 01:26:37,239
Take mother inside.

1411
01:26:37,406 --> 01:26:40,170
Come, mother. There is an urgent
call from office asking to come.

1412
01:26:40,243 --> 01:26:41,505
We should leave for
America immediately.

1413
01:26:41,611 --> 01:26:43,272
America? Now?

1414
01:26:43,346 --> 01:26:44,540
Yes.

1415
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:50,317
Hello. Book two business
class tickets to America urgently.

1416
01:26:50,386 --> 01:26:51,944
l am sending both mother
and daughter there.

1417
01:26:52,054 --> 01:26:53,851
Hey... CD... what happened to the CD?

1418
01:26:53,956 --> 01:26:56,390
First book the tickets. CD will come.

1419
01:27:06,936 --> 01:27:08,403
Why are you watching like that?

1420
01:27:09,839 --> 01:27:11,534
Murthy, why are you
looking at me with disgust?

1421
01:27:12,775 --> 01:27:16,040
l am sending mother and
daughter to America safely.

1422
01:27:16,546 --> 01:27:19,640
From there l will go and
give the CD to Voltaire Vasu.

1423
01:27:20,116 --> 01:27:21,549
This is what is doing to happen.

1424
01:27:22,084 --> 01:27:25,520
Murthy, nobody can give
a better solution to this problem.

1425
01:27:26,255 --> 01:27:27,916
Stop watching like that.

1426
01:27:31,093 --> 01:27:33,960
What? Why do you
look at me with disgust?

1427
01:27:35,097 --> 01:27:36,758
Didn,t l tell you
not to watch like that?

1428
01:27:37,133 --> 01:27:40,830
You go. First you go to station.
Don,t stand in front of my eyes. Goï

1429
01:27:42,038 --> 01:27:43,130
Goï

- Tell me.

1437
01:28:11,868 --> 01:28:12,960
Not yet.

1438
01:28:13,035 --> 01:28:14,900
Take it immediately
and come to the guest.

1439
01:28:15,404 --> 01:28:16,496
Okay.

1440
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:24,410

We are going to America.

1443
01:28:48,804 --> 01:28:50,897
l think Deepti might come home.

1444
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:56,473
Tell her that l am not angry.

1445
01:28:57,079 --> 01:28:59,741
l will tell her.
l think you are late. Go.

1446
01:29:32,848 --> 01:29:34,975
Brotherï

1447
01:29:46,262 --> 01:29:49,789
40 days...
they have raped my sister for 40 days.

1448
01:29:52,134 --> 01:29:54,398
Brother, this is not rape and murder.

1449
01:29:54,637 --> 01:29:58,801
Burning... sister,
they are burning the entire body.

1450
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:01,372
They have burnt her with acid.

1451

-Supun@zoom.lk-

1454
01:30:19,595 --> 01:30:21,392
See that CD once, brother.

1455
01:30:22,531 --> 01:30:24,328
Don,t spare them easily.

1456
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,265
They should get punished
according to the law.

1457
01:30:26,602 --> 01:30:27,967
Entire country should know.

1458
01:30:28,037 --> 01:30:30,471
lf anybody tries to do it
again then should be die out of fear.

1459
01:30:32,508 --> 01:30:35,170
Brother, who have the freedom
for these animals to roam free...

1460
01:30:35,344 --> 01:30:37,812
...on roads in my country.

1461
01:30:46,288 --> 01:30:48,051
Brother, don,t spare such people.

1462
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:53,318
My conscience says justice
will happen only by you.

1463
01:30:54,397 --> 01:30:58,390
l will come again when it happens.

1464

01:31:19,555 --> 01:31:22,080
- Where are your brothers?
- They found a new bird.

1467
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:27,357
Sir, our daughter is

01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:35,268
Pick up the phone.

1469

Pick up the phone.

1472
01:32:08,838 --> 01:32:11,830
You are talking as if rapes
and murders happened because of me.

1473
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:13,807
Why do you join the
department for no reason?

1474
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:23,011
What is it, sir? You said
you will go to the guest house.

1475
01:32:23,719 --> 01:32:25,983
Why did you bring the CD here?

1476
01:32:29,425 --> 01:32:31,222
Sir, l think it is Voltaire Vasu.

1477
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,825
Will you talk?

1478
01:32:34,063 --> 01:32:36,554
Why are you like that, sir?
What happened?

1479
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,528
Sir, you are shedding tears.

1480

l never saw you like that.

1481
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:44,229
What happened, sir?

01:32:44,974 --> 01:32:46,669
Something happened

What happened, sir?

1484
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:51,236
lf nothing happened...

1485
01:32:51,514 --> 01:32:53,072
...then the vehicle should
have gone there directly.

1486
01:32:53,149 --> 01:32:55,310
Why did it come to the station?

1487
01:32:55,551 --> 01:32:58,418
lf nothing happened then the
CD that should be in his hands...

1488
01:32:58,521 --> 01:33:00,455
...how come it came here.

1489
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:04,587
lf nothing happened then
why are you not taking his call?

1490
01:33:04,894 --> 01:33:07,590
Sir, something is hitting meï
Sir, something is hitting meï

1491
01:33:07,696 --> 01:33:09,425

Murthy, l didn,t changeï

01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:20,472
l am a rogue who will commit
any mistake for a mistake.

1495
01:33:20,976 --> 01:33:23,501
l am Daya without
having any compassion.

1496
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:25,576
You don,t nag me.

1497
01:33:25,648 --> 01:33:27,445
- Stopï
- Sir, you are lying.

1498
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:28,812
You have changedï

1499
01:33:28,884 --> 01:33:30,442
l am saying noï

1500
01:33:30,553 --> 01:33:32,043

l will shoot youï

1504
01:33:42,198 --> 01:33:43,790
Don,t irritate me.

1505
01:33:44,266 --> 01:33:46,700
l am thinking because
you have wife and children.

1506
01:33:48,137 --> 01:33:50,071
Mr. Murthy?

1507
01:33:51,373 --> 01:33:53,898
Sir, did you remember
my age after so many days?

1508
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,681
Sir, since when did you start
thinking of neighbour,s family?

1509
01:34:02,318 --> 01:34:04,479
Sir, this is called change.

1510
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:07,116
You have changedï

01:34:07,223 --> 01:34:09,316
Sir, you have changedï

You have changedï

1513
01:34:18,133 --> 01:34:22,160
l don,t know how much you struggled while
taking birth from your mother,s womb...

1514
01:34:22,504 --> 01:34:24,734
...but in order to born from within...

1515
01:34:24,974 --> 01:34:28,705
...you are struggling a lot.
Sir, you are struggling a lot.

1516
01:34:34,216 --> 01:34:36,810
Sir, l am saying you have changed...

1517
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:39,353
...and you say you didn,t change..
debate is unnecessary.

1518
01:34:39,588 --> 01:34:41,215
They will say it.

1519
01:34:42,324 --> 01:34:46,488
lf those rascals go out
with CD then you are correct.

1520
01:34:46,829 --> 01:34:49,855
But only if their bodies go out...

1521
01:34:50,299 --> 01:34:51,994
...l am correct, sir.

1522
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:55,264
Sir, l will sit there and watch.

Heyï All these you have
seen a son born to corruption.

1548
01:38:53,609 --> 01:38:58,273
My mother... my mother law and
order too had given birth to a child.

1549
01:38:59,414 --> 01:39:02,281
Name is Daya. Dayaï

1550
01:39:02,618 --> 01:39:06,110
He will break your eyes
without showing any compassion.

1551
01:39:06,788 --> 01:39:09,120
He took charge just today.

1552
01:39:09,224 --> 01:39:11,886
Henceforth and your brothers...

1553
01:39:12,094 --> 01:39:14,619
...not even God can save them.

1554
01:39:14,763 --> 01:39:19,325
Ta-taï See youï Bye-byeï

Heyï Heyï What is that dialogue?

1556
01:39:23,338 --> 01:39:24,464
What is that dialogue?

1557
01:39:24,606 --> 01:39:27,097
Sirï We were on touch
till one hour back.

1558
01:39:27,209 --> 01:39:29,973
He told me to book two business class
tickets. He said he will bring the CD.

1559
01:39:30,112 --> 01:39:32,012
Now she shouted something and left.
What did he say, sir?

1560
01:39:32,147 --> 01:39:34,206
He said it very clearly.

1561
01:39:34,349 --> 01:39:37,477
He said his mother had
a child so he couldn,t come.

1562
01:39:37,619 --> 01:39:39,143
He should be with her
when the child is born, right?

1563
01:39:39,288 --> 01:39:41,449
You are talking of CD since long time.

1564
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:44,252
lf it is so important then
why did you give it to him?

1565
01:39:46,929 --> 01:39:48,760
- Who gave him Ministry?
- What?

1566
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,559
He has cheated usï

1567
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:52,896
He is not our man. He has changed.

1568
01:39:53,001 --> 01:39:54,901
You brought him and
kept him on my head.

1569
01:39:55,037 --> 01:39:57,767
You only said you wanted
a worst guy than you.

1570
01:39:57,906 --> 01:39:59,771
How come you drop in between?

1571
01:40:02,044 --> 01:40:04,103
Hey, first leave from here.

1572
01:40:04,179 --> 01:40:05,271
All of you go underground.

1573
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,347
- Okay?
- What will he do?

1574
01:40:06,448 --> 01:40:07,506
What will he come and do?

1575
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:08,811
What will he do?

1576
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:11,511
Hey, do you know what you did?

1577
01:40:11,687 --> 01:40:14,485
Murder should be like murder..
rape should be like rape.

1578
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:16,683
Leaving all that,
you shot it yourself with camera...

1579
01:40:16,758 --> 01:40:20,819
...and prepare CDs and keep it
on my head. Will you keep it? Rascalsï

1580
01:40:21,029 --> 01:40:23,156

,,You got to call him saviourï,,

1593
01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:33,697
,,You got to call him saviourï,,

1595
01:41:37,072 --> 01:41:40,132
,,You got to call him saviourï,,

1596
01:41:45,614 --> 01:41:47,741
Brother, he is not allowing
us to leave cross Vizag.

1597
01:41:47,816 --> 01:41:50,250
- What should we do?
- Don,t come outï

1598
01:41:50,519 --> 01:41:52,783
Don,t come out until l tell you.

1599
01:42:22,818 --> 01:42:23,910
Hello?

1600
01:42:23,985 --> 01:42:25,748
Mr. Venkatrao, you had a mangrove, right?

1601
01:42:25,854 --> 01:42:28,220
We want to buy it.
What do you say, sir?

1602
01:42:28,657 --> 01:42:31,182
l had it. l lost it in land grabbing.

1603
01:42:31,426 --> 01:42:33,986
Ohï ls it? Who did it, sir?

1604
01:42:34,463 --> 01:42:36,658
lt is natural for rowdies
to do land grabbing.

1605
01:42:36,732 --> 01:42:39,394
But a policeman who
should protect the public...

1606
01:42:39,501 --> 01:42:41,196
...has cheated.

1607
01:42:41,803 --> 01:42:43,327
So didn,t you get angry?

1608
01:42:43,605 --> 01:42:45,630
Didn,t you feel like doing
something to that policeman?

1609
01:42:46,007 --> 01:42:49,272
Anger? l wanted to give
him a tight slap and ask him...

1610
01:42:49,845 --> 01:42:52,473
...how did you parents
brought you up?

1611
01:42:56,084 --> 01:42:57,745
Sir, l don,t have parents.

1612
01:43:00,388 --> 01:43:02,549
Sir, l don,t have parents.

1613
01:43:03,191 --> 01:43:04,556
l am an orphan.

1614
01:43:05,927 --> 01:43:07,895
l was born to air and grew up in air.

1615
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,755
Sir, l had nobody
to teach me good and bad.

1616
01:43:11,133 --> 01:43:13,328
l believed what l saw is true.

1617
01:43:15,203 --> 01:43:17,262
Sir, there is no
mother to give food too.

1618
01:43:18,106 --> 01:43:19,835
My stomach would burn.

1619
01:43:20,342 --> 01:43:22,640
l thought how to survive but...

1620
01:43:22,978 --> 01:43:24,946
...l didn,t think how to live.

1621
01:43:25,013 --> 01:43:26,981
Sir, l don,t even know how l lived.

1622
01:43:27,616 --> 01:43:29,208
Sir, l committed a mistake.

1623
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:31,414
Just now you said
you will do something.

1624
01:43:32,854 --> 01:43:35,721
Do itï Beat me, sir.

1625
01:43:36,658 --> 01:43:39,092
When you beat me now then
l should go and beat them.

1626
01:43:40,796 --> 01:43:43,264
Beat me, sir. Beat meï

1627
01:43:44,866 --> 01:43:48,996
Why do you watch me when son
is committing mistake? Beat, fatherï

1628
01:43:50,972 --> 01:43:53,532
Beat me, fatherï Beat meï

1629
01:44:30,645 --> 01:44:34,809
By tomorrow morning if the papers are
no written in the old man,s name...

1630
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:39,784
...then there will be a bomb under
Vasu day after tomorrow early morning.

1631
01:44:40,155 --> 01:44:41,679
Tell him.

1632
01:44:42,958 --> 01:44:44,585
Sanvi, l am not a good person.

1633
01:44:45,427 --> 01:44:47,987
Everything l told you is a
lie and whatever l did was cheating.

1634
01:44:49,297 --> 01:44:50,889
But now l have changed, Sanvi.

1635
01:44:51,867 --> 01:44:53,562
You are the reason behind that change.

1636
01:44:54,536 --> 01:44:55,730
l am this.

1637
01:44:57,038 --> 01:44:58,369
Your wish after that.

1638
01:45:03,945 --> 01:45:06,106
Who told you to tell the truth?

1639
01:45:06,815 --> 01:45:08,476
You didn,t tell me
when should have told me.

1640
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:10,780
You told me when
there is no need to do.

1641
01:45:10,986 --> 01:45:13,318
Now l am in confusion.

1642
01:45:14,022 --> 01:45:16,320
Will you stay with me or not?

1643
01:45:17,626 --> 01:45:21,221
Actually l should leave you.

1644
01:45:22,731 --> 01:45:26,098
Since you said that my contribution
is major behind your change...

1645
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:27,395
...so little satisfaction.

1646
01:45:28,303 --> 01:45:31,067
Let us manage with this now.

1647
01:45:31,373 --> 01:45:32,806
What do you say?

1648
01:45:33,842 --> 01:45:35,173

They are showing Deepti,s
dead body again and again.

01:52:40,068 --> 01:52:42,866
Mother collapsed after seeing it.

1751
01:52:44,205 --> 01:52:45,900
Severe heart attack.

1752
01:52:46,407 --> 01:52:48,739
l had to admit her in hospital.

1753
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:51,708

Sir, they have brutally
raped and killed Deepti.

01:53:14,669 --> 01:53:16,864
This has become a
big issue in the country.

1761
01:53:16,971 --> 01:53:19,701
Whole lndia is waiting
for your judgement.

1762
01:53:19,807 --> 01:53:22,742
Please do justice to Deepti,
your honourï

1763

Produce the evidence.

1764
01:53:51,139 --> 01:53:54,472
What is this? The one
which you submitted as proof.

1765
01:53:54,809 --> 01:53:58,006
That CD is empty.
There is no data in it.

1766
01:53:58,079 --> 01:53:59,376
ls this your proof?

1767
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,914
There was data in the
CD when we produced it.

1768
01:54:01,983 --> 01:54:04,178
Your honour,
there has been some manipulation.

1769
01:54:06,087 --> 01:54:09,648
Sir, court doesn,t want ifs and buts.
lt wants evidence and truth.

1770
01:54:09,757 --> 01:54:12,590
By keeping a blank CD and
wasting the time of court...

1771
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:16,061
...they have framed my clients,
who are innocent, in a dangerous case.

1772
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:18,164
lt is a clear cut case, your honour.

1773
01:54:18,266 --> 01:54:20,734
l request the court to identify
my clients as not guilty...

1774
01:54:20,835 --> 01:54:23,030
...and release them.

1775
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:24,765
Sir, did you sell it?

1776
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:27,437
Did you sell the CD?
For how much you sold it?

1777
01:54:27,508 --> 01:54:29,032
Orderï Orderï

1778
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,506
Due to lack of evidence...

1779
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:37,778
...we declare these
four people as not guilty..

1780
01:54:37,852 --> 01:54:40,184
Sir, l have proof with me.

1781
01:54:42,957 --> 01:54:44,049
What proof you have?

1782
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:46,888
You take one day,s time.
l have proof with me.

1783
01:54:46,961 --> 01:54:48,690
lt is not that...
you don,t seem to understand it.

1784
01:54:48,796 --> 01:54:50,263
lt will become a big problem
if you extend the case...

1785
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:51,423
...and don,t produce any proof.

1786
01:54:51,666 --> 01:54:53,600
Sir, you take one day,s
time by trusting me.

1787
01:54:53,701 --> 01:54:55,794
l will definitely submit it.

1788
01:54:58,339 --> 01:55:01,035
Your honour, there is evidence.

1789
01:55:01,108 --> 01:55:03,474
l asked for one day,s
time to produce it.

1790
01:55:03,544 --> 01:55:05,068
l object your honour.

1791
01:55:05,146 --> 01:55:08,115
Until now they said CD and
now they are saying some proof.

1792
01:55:08,216 --> 01:55:10,650
Our clients have already
faced lot of damage.

1793
01:55:10,718 --> 01:55:13,846
Entire country is thinking
that my clients are accused.

1794
01:55:13,955 --> 01:55:16,856
Your honour,
it is not good to extend this case.

1795
01:55:21,095 --> 01:55:23,325
One day extension granted.

1796
01:55:23,998 --> 01:55:27,092
- Noï
- The court is adjourned.

1797
01:55:27,568 --> 01:55:31,732
Evidence goes missing in the court,
Deepti,s case postponed for tomorrow.

1798
01:55:31,839 --> 01:55:34,933
By the way, what is there with him?
Did he say something?

1799
01:55:35,977 --> 01:55:37,672
However l ask him,
he is not telling me.

1800
01:55:38,212 --> 01:55:41,545
There is something with him.
Otherwise he won,t look so confident.

1801
01:55:43,518 --> 01:55:45,076
Should l tell the truth?

1802
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,278
l don,t have any proof with me.

1803
01:55:47,822 --> 01:55:50,916
What is it? But you said you
will submit in the court tomorrow.

1804
01:55:51,092 --> 01:55:53,151
Had l not said like that
then they would have been left.

1805
01:55:53,261 --> 01:55:55,126
How did the CD get exchanged?

1806
01:55:55,196 --> 01:55:57,630
Sanvi, don,t l know this corruption?

1807
01:55:58,599 --> 01:55:59,827
All these years l believed that...

1808
01:55:59,901 --> 01:56:02,392
...l am the worst guy in department
and others are very good.

1809
01:56:03,037 --> 01:56:06,632
By believing it, l took that CD
and gave it to the lawyer.

1810
01:56:07,108 --> 01:56:10,373
Had l been like before then
l would have made many copies of it.

1811
01:56:14,048 --> 01:56:18,815
- What about tomorrow?
- Don,t knowï Don,t knowï

1812
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:42,934
Hey, cheaterï

Bottle?

1897
02:02:49,143 --> 02:02:53,477
l trusted brother Vasu
and was waiting for the bottle.

1898
02:02:54,148 --> 02:02:57,311
You not only cheated me,
moreover will you do manhandling.

1899
02:03:12,232 --> 02:03:15,201
Who beat me on ribs?

1900

Someone beat me in between

l didn,t like him.

1906
02:03:59,313 --> 02:04:01,042
Who is he?

1907
02:04:01,248 --> 02:04:02,647
Who is he?

Hey, if you don,t get me correctly.

1912

Who is the guy in shirt who

,l don,t know what to doï,

1919
02:05:31,205 --> 02:05:34,038
Only ten minutes are left
for the court session to begin.

1920
02:05:34,108 --> 02:05:36,406
Everyone is waiting for
the evidence Daya will bring.

1921
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:38,171
Will Daya come or not?

1922
02:05:38,245 --> 02:05:41,112
,,For the upliftment
of the good and virtuous.,,

1923
02:05:41,181 --> 02:05:43,513
Will Deepti get justice?

1924
02:05:43,584 --> 02:05:45,108
What is the proof he is having?

1925
02:05:45,185 --> 02:05:47,813
,,For the destruction of evil.,,

1926
02:05:48,055 --> 02:05:51,149

Last night our boys tried a lot.

1938
02:06:21,455 --> 02:06:22,922
lt didn,t work out well.

1939
02:06:23,257 --> 02:06:25,384
What do you think?
Do l have proof or no?

1940
02:06:25,492 --> 02:06:27,119
Don,t keep quiz programs at this time.

1941
02:06:27,227 --> 02:06:29,787
lf you have anything then give it to me.
l will give as much money as you want.

1942
02:06:30,664 --> 02:06:32,291
Tell me one figure that l like.

02:06:36,770 --> 02:06:38,237
- Didn,t like.
- 100 crores.

1945
02:06:38,305 --> 02:06:39,397
l didn,t like it.

1946
02:06:39,673 --> 02:06:41,971
Heyï Heyï Do you know
how much is 100 crores?

1947
02:06:42,042 --> 02:06:43,441
Even my entire property is
not sufficient.

1948
02:06:43,544 --> 02:06:44,738
l have to borrow 30 more crores.

1949
02:06:46,213 --> 02:06:47,805
How much you love your brothersï

1950

,,For the upliftment

02:06:57,858 --> 02:07:01,157
,,For the destruction of evil.,,

,,For the re-establishment

,,l will come, in every age.,,

1956
02:07:13,907 --> 02:07:16,341
Where is the proof that
you said you will submit?

1957
02:07:16,577 --> 02:07:18,807
Judge sir is asking for the proof.

1958
02:07:24,484 --> 02:07:26,281
Where is the proof?

1959
02:07:26,787 --> 02:07:28,721
Your honour, l am the proof.

1960
02:07:29,189 --> 02:07:31,851
- l am personal witness.
- Did you see?

1961
02:07:32,059 --> 02:07:33,549
Did you see those four people...

1962
02:07:33,627 --> 02:07:35,720
...raping Deepti?

1963
02:07:35,929 --> 02:07:37,988
Not four people, your honourï

1964
02:07:38,365 --> 02:07:41,766
Five people have raped
and killed Deeptiï

1965
02:07:45,005 --> 02:07:48,463
Fifth one is nobody but meï

1966
02:07:54,715 --> 02:07:56,740
We five people have kidnapped herï

1967
02:07:56,850 --> 02:07:58,078
Heyï Are you mad?

1968
02:07:58,185 --> 02:08:01,052
We five people have
tortured her badlyï

1969
02:08:01,121 --> 02:08:01,917
Sir, he is telling liesï

1970
02:08:02,022 --> 02:08:04,786
Sir, we had pierced her with needles,
we had cut her with blades.

1971
02:08:05,959 --> 02:08:07,722
Not one or two, your honourï

1972
02:08:07,794 --> 02:08:11,059
We showed her hell for 40 daysï

1973
02:08:11,898 --> 02:08:13,661
Sir, she would request us to kill herï

1974
02:08:13,734 --> 02:08:16,726
We all would feel happy
when she asked like that.

1975
02:08:17,704 --> 02:08:19,001
Sir, we are sadist roguesï

1976
02:08:19,706 --> 02:08:20,297
lsn,t it?

1977
02:08:20,374 --> 02:08:21,341
- Hey, psychoï
- Sir, he is telling liesï

1978
02:08:21,408 --> 02:08:23,672
- Sir, he is telling liesï
- Orderï Orderï

1979
02:08:25,212 --> 02:08:28,579
lf you are one of them then
why did you file case on them?

1980
02:08:28,649 --> 02:08:31,140
Sir, l asked for money.
They didn,t give it.

1981
02:08:31,218 --> 02:08:34,244
Sir, we fell out with each other.
l decided to do black mail to them.

1982
02:08:34,488 --> 02:08:36,718
l lied to them saying l have a CD.
They didn,t believe it.

1983
02:08:36,990 --> 02:08:39,288
l filed the case.
They feared and escaped.

1984
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:42,693
You all came to know that l have
kept a blank CD in court yesterday.

1985
02:08:42,929 --> 02:08:44,794
But still l lied saying
l have another proof.

1986
02:08:45,232 --> 02:08:49,168
Sir, they tried to get me killed
last time. They beat me very badly.

1987
02:08:49,469 --> 02:08:51,369
They left me by thinking l died.

1988
02:08:54,675 --> 02:08:56,870
Sir, when l was on
the verge of death...

1989
02:08:57,911 --> 02:09:00,471
...l understood the
hell that girl experienced.

1990
02:09:04,685 --> 02:09:06,448
l started repenting.

1991
02:09:08,055 --> 02:09:11,286
l should have died,
l thought why am l alive.

1992
02:09:12,059 --> 02:09:15,825
Millions of people..
temple like court.

1993
02:09:16,096 --> 02:09:17,723
God like you.

1994
02:09:18,332 --> 02:09:20,994
Sir, l felt l stayed alive
for telling the truth to you all.

1995
02:09:21,468 --> 02:09:23,868
Sir, even now too this
rascal tried to buy me...

1996
02:09:23,937 --> 02:09:25,632
...on the staircase outside the court.

1997
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:28,671
Sir, l don,t want money now.

1998
02:09:29,109 --> 02:09:30,701
l want truth.

1999
02:09:32,145 --> 02:09:35,046
Sir, we all committed
big crime on Deepti.

2000
02:09:36,016 --> 02:09:38,007
Don,t spare us.

2001
02:09:38,218 --> 02:09:42,814
Sir, actually we were not
supposed to kidnap Deepti that day.

2002
02:09:43,323 --> 02:09:45,621
lt was your granddaughter Sandhyaï

2003
02:09:50,497 --> 02:09:53,557
You don,t feel like believing it, right?
Sandhya, sir.

2004
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:56,496
Gitam,s college,
studying in second year.

2005
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:58,834
She goes to tuition to Gajuwaka daily.

2006
02:09:59,039 --> 02:10:01,735
ln fact we planned to trap
your granddaughter Sandhya, sir.

2007
02:10:02,409 --> 02:10:04,673
We had fixed it, sir.
Recce was done.

2008
02:10:04,778 --> 02:10:07,008
Exactly on the day of kidnapping...

2009
02:10:07,114 --> 02:10:08,706
...Sandhya didn,t come.

2010
02:10:08,949 --> 02:10:10,883
Deepti was found. l said no.

2011
02:10:10,984 --> 02:10:12,212
But Mani didn,t agree, sir.

2012
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:14,947
- Sirï Sirï He is telling lies.
- Let us kidnap Deepti...

2013
02:10:15,155 --> 02:10:16,281
...is she not a woman?

2014
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:17,880
We will see Sandhya later.
He said all this, sir.

2015
02:10:17,991 --> 02:10:20,084
Sirï Sirï He is telling utter lies.

2016
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:21,659
Sir, he is telling lies.

2017
02:10:22,062 --> 02:10:24,394
Sir, l think on Thursday or Friday...

2018
02:10:24,464 --> 02:10:26,728
...we came again for Sandhya.

2019
02:10:27,067 --> 02:10:29,592
But Sandhya was not there.
She went to Guntur.

2020
02:10:30,203 --> 02:10:33,366
l think to your brother,s house.
l think he lives there.

2021
02:10:36,309 --> 02:10:38,777
Didn,t you fear while
committing such crime?

2022
02:10:38,845 --> 02:10:41,313
Fear for what, sir? What will you do?

2023
02:10:41,848 --> 02:10:43,975
Maximum punishment will
be life imprisonment.

2024
02:10:44,584 --> 02:10:46,711
Sir, if not this court
then another court.

2025
02:10:46,953 --> 02:10:49,353
There are hundreds of sections..
there are hundreds of tricks.

2026
02:10:51,425 --> 02:10:54,917
Sir, we are able to rape
a girl immediately after seeing her.

2027
02:10:55,395 --> 02:10:57,329
Are you able to punish immediately?

2028
02:10:58,532 --> 02:11:01,365
Leave all that, sir.
We accept that we committed mistake.

2029
02:11:01,835 --> 02:11:05,430
Will you be able to
hang us in a day or two?

2030
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,530
lt never happened anytime in lndia...

2031
02:11:08,608 --> 02:11:10,508
...so how can we hang you within
two days, you will say this.

2032
02:11:11,478 --> 02:11:15,175
Sir, there are already 52 prisoners
in this country who got hanged.

no respect on them at all...

What you they do at the maximum level?
They will hang youï Dieï

02:12:52,078 --> 02:12:54,308
But the justice you
believe in will surviveï

2056
02:12:54,381 --> 02:12:57,407
Either stay on
that side or to this sideï

2057
02:13:17,037 --> 02:13:19,062
Why did you do this?

2058
02:13:19,139 --> 02:13:21,369
Why did you take the blame on you?

2059
02:13:21,441 --> 02:13:23,306
Daya, you committed a big mistake.

2060
02:13:23,543 --> 02:13:25,477

Sirï

2078

Sensational judgement in
the country for the first time.

2079
02:14:36,049 --> 02:14:38,381
Culprits are going
to be handed within a day.

2080
02:14:41,454 --> 02:14:44,082
Rascalï Are we psychos?

2081

Will they call us psycho in court?

02:14:57,737 --> 02:15:00,570
Like never before,

02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:02,733
...are waiting for the
scoundrels to die and...

- What? Food?
- Yes.

2090
02:15:11,117 --> 02:15:12,914
On one hand we are going

Along with this...

2096
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:25,990
...Samba asked for sambar
and papad compulsorily.

2097
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:30,694
Remaining four didn,t
eat food out of fear for death.

2098
02:15:31,137 --> 02:15:33,901
Only one hour and 25 minutes are left.

2099
02:16:19,052 --> 02:16:20,917
- Hello.
- What, Mr. Murthy?

2100
02:16:20,987 --> 02:16:22,545
What is happening?

2101
02:16:22,622 --> 02:16:24,749
Mother is unwell so l am in hospital.

02:16:26,626 --> 02:16:29,424
- How come they hang brother?

...so in order to get
justice for your Deepti...

2106
02:16:32,999 --> 02:16:34,864
...and by thinking that

02:16:34,968 --> 02:16:37,232
...he took the blame on himself.

2108
02:16:45,478 --> 02:16:47,241

First stop the hanging sentenceï

2114
02:17:03,630 --> 02:17:05,791
Daya is not related
to this crime at all.

2115
02:17:10,503 --> 02:17:12,630
Those four people
have killed my sister.

2116
02:17:12,839 --> 02:17:14,739
l have CD with me.

2117
02:17:15,275 --> 02:17:17,743
Pleaseï Telecast it urgently.

2118

lt is okay if those
four people are left...

2119
02:17:31,090 --> 02:17:33,217
...but don,t kill my brother.

2120
02:17:33,893 --> 02:17:36,361
He is making a sacrifice
which no brother will do.

Daya, we received orders
to stop you from hanging.

2125
02:18:03,356 --> 02:18:04,755
Didn,t you commit this crime?

2126
02:18:04,858 --> 02:18:06,758
Entire CD is being telecast on TV.

2127
02:18:06,826 --> 02:18:08,885
Sir, l don,t know
the matter of CD now.

2128
02:18:08,962 --> 02:18:11,328
Have they asked to stop
only my punishment or everyone?

2129
02:18:11,397 --> 02:18:14,525
- Only yours.
- So will you kill us by sparing him?

2130
02:18:16,336 --> 02:18:17,325

Sir, these rogues have

2134
02:18:27,046 --> 02:18:28,843
Don,t kill them with
two minutes punishment.

2135
02:18:28,915 --> 02:18:31,509
Sir, untie me for just
10 minutes and see what happens.

2136
02:18:31,751 --> 02:18:33,150

Anyway you will hang them.

2138
02:18:34,621 --> 02:18:36,589
Sir, leave them to me
for ten minutes before that.

Don,t write in book.

He didn,t fire the gunï

2144
02:18:46,532 --> 02:18:49,023
Our policemen didn,t receive
any bullets so you didn,t untie me.

2145
02:18:49,302 --> 02:18:51,133
This matter will remain
between four walls.

2146
02:18:51,204 --> 02:18:53,604
Listen to me and untie me, sir.
Only 10 minutes.

2147
02:18:53,673 --> 02:18:55,231
l will not use more than that.

2148
02:18:55,408 --> 02:18:56,898
These rogues don,t need it too.

2149
02:18:56,976 --> 02:18:59,376
- Untie me, sir.
