2
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,286
Those two must be
looking for you, right?

3
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,557
Let them...

4
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,735
Where do you find these kind?

5
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,063
Anywhere... everywhere.

6
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,117
Don't do it...

7
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,024
Please listen to me. Don't do it!

8
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,024
Let that cop show up...

9
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,464
I'll return your money.

10
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,096
I just got off the phone...
He'll be here any moment.

11
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,028
Killing me won't get you a thing...

12
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,236
Am I not your beloved "uncle", now?

13
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,513
What do you do?

14
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,214
Me?

15
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,406
Yeah?

16
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,383
Shopping...

17
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,545
I meant besides shopping.

18
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,585
I Party!

19
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,717
And who pays for it?

20
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,492
There's always someone eager to pay.

21
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,727
Why isn't he taking my call?

22
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,763
Who's not taking your call?

23
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,762
Uncle

24
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,666
Your dealer?

25
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,201
I'll be back.

26
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,082
You keep a gun?

27
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,149
You never know.

28
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,179
What do you do?

29
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,087
Shopping!

30
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,599
Uncle!

31
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,272
Open the door, uncle!

32
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,987
Uncle, I know you're inside.

33
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,622
Uncle!

34
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,519
Uncle...

35
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,525
That torch is blinding me!

36
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,760
Uncle's gone out. He'll be here.

37
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,236
Who are you? Have we met before?

38
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,073
Lower the damn torch!

39
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,277
Sir... you shaved off your beard?

40
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,740
He's crushed their
heads with a rock...

41
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,084
One's a drug dealer,
the other is his neighbor.

42
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,753
With a rock?

43
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,652
Yes, he's crushed both
heads with the same rock.

44
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,382
Sir!

45
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,348
Sir!

46
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,651
Sir!

47
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,648
Someone's sent this for you.

48
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,395
Hello!

49
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,166
Who do you want to talk to?

50
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,368
Sir.

51
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,401
There's some guy on the line...

52
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,002
Says he'll only speak to you
about the double murders.

53
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,115
Hello!

54
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,211
Mr. Raghavan?

55
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,583
Yes, speaking. Who is this?

56
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,998
Hello?

57
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,570
Hello!

58
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,340
Who was it, sir?

59
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,543
He hung up.

60
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,659
Who gave you this?

61
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,701
Some random guy.

62
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:15,534
Hello!

63
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,698
Sir...

64
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,503
A man named Sindhi Dalwai
is here to see you, Sir

65
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,578
He was sitting outside the police
station. I've seen him earlier.

66
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:28,084
He walked in and confessed to all
the 9 murders in last couple of years.

67
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,649
He hasn't spoken a word since.

68
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,655
He says he will only speak to you.

69
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,083
Get him to our 'safe house'. I will
be there with the commissioner.

70
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,764
I was quietly sleeping in my corner...

71
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,726
When this beat cop kicked
me off the pavement.

72
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:54,477
I didn't have money
to pay the bribe...

73
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,377
So I left for the train station.

74
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,040
Thought I'll catch the last train...

75
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,416
and spend the night
in the docking yard.

76
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,147
I've done this many times.

77
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,215
But it started raining
out of nowhere...

78
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:14,564
I took shelter under a tin roof.

79
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,397
When the rain stopped,
the train had left already.

80
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,044
If I could get a cigarette...

81
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,231
Is Sindhi Dalwai your real name?

82
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,467
Yes it is... for now.

83
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,664
I chose it myself.

84
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,535
Remember that famous
serial killer 'Raman Raghav'?

85
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,549
His real name was Sindhi Dalwai too...
That's why I chose this name.

86
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,618
You don't know about him?

87
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,022
That uncle from downtown...
He knew him well.

88
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,582
And how much do you know'?

89
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,200
He had a wireless radio...

90
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,662
He'd call it 'The World'...

91
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,436
He used the radio
to talk to God...

92
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,206
And God would guide
him whom to Kill next.

93
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,048
He was Death-God's
favorite messenger.

94
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,083
I've seen you somewhere.

95
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,296
But I see you everyday, sir.

96
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,162
On TV... newspapers.

97
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,493
I sit outside the police station,
right?

98
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,262
So I watch you go in
and out of the station.

99
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,231
I have my eyes on you.

100
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,069
You have it in you too.

101
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,575
What?

102
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,612
License

103
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,215
TO kill... at Will

104
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,142
Because you have the uniform.

105
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,380
It's the cops' job to clean up
the aberrations of God...

106
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,711
I do the same.

107
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,652
So technically,
we both are messengers of Death.

108
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,685
But government gives you
food to eat, house to live in.

109
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,032
But I see you...

110
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,709
I believe I know you
more than you know yourself.

111
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,083
Have you ever called
our police station?

112
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,255
Who me?

113
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,586
- Yeah?
- Nope.

114
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,024
Two years back?

115
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,288
I never called...

116
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,465
Didn't you ask for
a cop named Raghavan?

117
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,565
If I had a phone or the
number for the station...

118
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,105
why would I sit outside
waiting for you?

119
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,314
Leave the pack here.

120
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,591
So after the rain stopped,
I started walking again.

121
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,535
You know... I was born a nightcrawler.

122
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:46,409
Dad used to call me a fox. Apparently,
my eyes glow in the dark.

123
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:52,209
Sir, it's very unsafe to walk
the streets at night.

124
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,611
Lot of drunk drivers...

125
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:01,017
So I walk only on the pavement.
Sometimes on the dividers...

126
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,554
Where they lay out the chessboard?
Like this...

127
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,055
those black and white
chequered tiles on the road.

128
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,530
I only walk on the black tiles...

129
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,270
Stepping on a white
tile means game over...

130
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,140
And I count the tiles.
It helps me pass time...

131
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,601
So I started walking on my blacks...

132
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,509
And I reached the end, where there
were no more blacks...

133
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,015
But I don't like to lose the game,
right?

134
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,577
God has gifted me with this talent...

135
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,646
if I imagine hard, I can
conjure up anything.

136
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,626
I imagined a black & white
carpet and walked on it.

137
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,526
And he came out of nowhere...

138
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,556
I asked him to move
away from my tiles.

139
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,693
He just wouldn't budge.
He was too drunk...

140
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:50,500
I tried to reason but
he just wouldn't understand.

141
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,001
Initially,
I was really polite to him...

142
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,271
then the voices in my head
awoke the animal in me.

143
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,939
He just stood there staring at me...

144
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,344
He was standing on my black tile.

145
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,217
The road authorities didn't
lay out the tiles, right?

146
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,323
I laid them with my own imagination...

147
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,717
He really didn't know who I was...

148
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,363
So I told him,
"Look, I am Sindhi Dalwai"

149
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,622
He didn't get it...

150
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,532
So I had to push him and he fell...
on MY black tile

151
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,629
On my path. Obviously,
he had to be moved, right?

152
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,174
But he was too drunk
and wouldn't listen to me...

153
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,610
That rattled me... pissed me off!

154
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,270
I found a rock next to him...

155
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,440
I picked it up and
smashed his fucking head.

156
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,187
He died right there...
on MY black tile.

157
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,523
So I had to file a complaint...

158
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,563
which is why I came
to the police station.

159
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,644
When I reached the Police station

160
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,113
I figured the police
were looking for me...

161
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,183
so I surrendered...

162
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,223
to clear the misunderstanding.

163
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,227
I've killed... about 9 people so far

164
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,795
The details were in the newspapers...

165
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,504
that's how I found their names.

166
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,143
The thing is, Death-God
talks to me, right?

167
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,715
He said "Ramana...

168
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,616
"...you can't go on killing just
because you can't find a place to sleep"

169
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,185
He told me to come to you...

170
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,561
He said "in prison, you'll
get food and shelter..."

171
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,290
"...and you won't
need to kill for that."

172
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:01,361
Ask those newspaper vendors at the
train station. They'd know him..

173
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,268
He gets his stories from the morning
papers and claims he did it...

174
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,072
Obviously, he's been told...

175
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,034
that you get free food and
blanket in prison.

176
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,308
But sir, we've got
to crosscheck his story...

177
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,414
Forget it!

178
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,218
He says he killed them
all on the streets...

179
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,055
- How many bodies found on streets'?
- Two

180
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,022
- And the remaining 7?
- In the slums...

181
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,424
We'll lose the real killer
because of this idiot.

182
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,163
Lock him up and bust his balIs...

183
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,062
Starve him... keep him awake till
he admits he's bulIshitting...

184
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,500
These idiots think prison is a hotel.

185
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,529
Sir's here

186
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,673
Where did you find this loser?

187
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,402
Sir...

188
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,237
He came on his own...

189
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,805
Maybe he read it in the papers
and landed outside the police station

190
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,169
Are you hungry'?

191
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,303
Want to eat?

192
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,104
Come along...

193
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,384
Had I known this housing
complex was abandoned...

194
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,761
I would have slept here instead.

195
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,259
Nice place...

196
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,430
So how many people
have you killed so far'?

197
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,601
Nine...

198
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,705
- You killed 9, eh?
- I killed 9.

199
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,364
Not 1 or 2, but 9?

200
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,408
- Yes that is correct.
- Okay, come along.

201
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,077
<i>How many murders?</i>

202
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:51,806
Nine...

203
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,674
How many'?

204
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,717
Nine.

205
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,513
Don't bulIshit us.

206
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,119
Get his legs.

207
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,551
No! Let go!

208
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,636
I was quietly doing my thing...

209
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,613
Three men came in that day.

210
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,448
Asked me if I needed food...

211
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,247
I was hungry...

212
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,352
So I came along with them.

213
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,119
They beat me up so hard!

214
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,061
They beat me so hard!

215
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,429
They even strangled me!

216
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,768
Beat me to pulp for 3 days!

217
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,703
Without any food or water.

218
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,578
My throat is dry as a bone...

219
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,343
I just have a cigarette...

220
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,683
But I don't have a
bloody match to light it!

221
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,287
We were in full form,
they had to lose...

222
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,694
That's great. Too bad I missed it.

223
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,024
Who did you play against?

224
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,428
Is there someone out there?

225
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,033
I heard someone...

226
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,769
Who cares...

227
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,012
Is anyone there?

228
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,102
Again?

229
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,511
"Someone get me out of here!"

230
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,549
I think the voice came from there...

231
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,617
Is anyone there?

232
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,622
Fear the lord!
Help a man who's held captive here.

233
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,794
Is anyone there?

234
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,687
Has everyone gone deaf and mute?

235
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:57,403
Get me out of here!
Is anyone there at all?

236
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,472
Over here. I am here.

237
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,578
They've held me locked me in...

238
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,051
I was quietly doing my thing.

239
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,249
Three men came in...

240
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,091
Asked me if I needed food.
They got me here.

241
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,992
They beat me so hard!

242
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,765
Left me to rot without food and water.

243
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,270
My throat is dry as a bone.

244
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,765
I just have a cigarette...

245
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,178
But I don't have a
bloody match to light it!

246
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,140
Be careful... it's hot!

247
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,361
What do you want?

248
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,632
These pipes...

249
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,443
I need one of these...

250
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,703
They are just lying here, right?

251
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,311
Got any money?

252
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,038
No. But these are just lying here.

253
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,640
You want them for free?

254
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,177
Want one smashed on your head?

255
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,318
How about it'?

256
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,523
Totally free?

257
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,322
I'll get you the color tomorrow.
Promise!

258
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,794
You shouldn't get into fights...

259
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,596
If you're polite,
and keep your voice low...

260
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,470
Nobody will pick on you.

261
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,147
Why are you here?

262
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,377
Is that your kid?

263
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,781
He's really grown up...

264
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,083
Afraid of me?

265
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,187
Afraid of your own uncle?

266
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,127
Didn't you tell him
that I am his uncle?

267
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,062
Come here, son.

268
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,602
Mommy is going to be
with you in two minutes...

269
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:12,304
You stay inside. Don't be afraid.

270
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,135
You can't come inside...

271
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,480
Look at my face...

272
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,142
See how they beat me up.

273
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,616
Haven't eaten anything for 4 days...
I've walked all the way here.

274
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,554
You sit out here...
I'll bring the food.

275
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,356
Don't try to come in. Sit down!

276
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,531
I am not a beggar!

277
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,035
I've come to you because
you're my sister.

278
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,432
And you're treating
me like a filthy dog?

279
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,133
I live here. I don't want
your crazy shit here.

280
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,141
Keep it low!

281
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,540
I know you live here.

282
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:48,771
Don't start it here.

283
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,644
Have I ever come to you?

284
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,548
In all these 7 years?

285
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,515
I have a reason this time.

286
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,815
What reason?

287
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,350
Give me some food...

288
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,685
Let me wash up. Give me clean clothes.

289
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,630
I'll be on my way... I have a job.

290
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,599
How did you find my address'?

291
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,336
God is punishing me...

292
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,410
for all my sins!

293
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,512
For the past two years...

294
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,148
your brother's survived
by eating rats.

295
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,216
Wear your own trouser...
My husband's won't fit you.

296
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,289
Are you using my son's toothbrush?

297
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,098
You could have asked.

298
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,604
Coming...

299
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,605
Listen to me...

300
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,610
I've finally found the right man...

301
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,651
He's right at the door...

302
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,983
Please don't say anything
stupid in front of him.

303
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,113
- I beg of you!
- Laxmi!

304
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,121
Yeah...

305
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,586
I beg of you!
I finally have a decent life.

306
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,456
Please don't ruin it!

307
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,257
You won't, right?

308
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,159
No.

309
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,358
- Laxmi!
- I am coming...

310
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,398
Your siblings, right?

311
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,629
Yes

312
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,205
And this is your entire family?

313
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,579
Yes...

314
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,513
My brother lives abroad...
In Sri Lanka.

315
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,712
And my sister's in Dubai.

316
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,185
How sweet!

317
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,250
No matter where you go...

318
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,628
blood ties remain forever.

319
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,130
But your wife doesn't
understand that...

320
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,728
Not a single picture of mine here.

321
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,734
We do have a picture of you...

322
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,608
She's shown it to me...

323
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,140
It's inside somewhere.

324
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,973
Rice or bread?

325
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,143
Whatever there in the fridge...

326
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,982
I'm okay with cold food too.

327
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,082
The way you love your siblings...

328
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,052
She doesn't love me.

329
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,095
My picture is 'inside somewhere'

330
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,066
What love!

331
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,000
What have you done
to deserve her love, Sir?

332
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:28,997
What do you mean?

333
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,506
She's told me a lot about you...

334
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,110
None of it matters now.
Please have some food...

335
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,176
- Please serve him.
- Go serve him...

336
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,615
No. I have to know
what she's told you.

337
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,652
Or I'm not going to eat.

338
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,286
God bless you child...

339
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,156
What if she's poisoned my food?

340
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,261
I used to feed you
with so much love...

341
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,424
I've lost my appetite.

342
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,628
I'll leave.

343
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,350
He's gone finally...

344
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,264
He is gone.

345
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,740
He won't come back, right?

346
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,708
He won't.

347
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,315
Don't worry!

348
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,509
Have you lost it? Somebody stop him!

349
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,109
Shut up or I'll finish him off...

350
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,752
Wait!

351
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,586
Stay away...

352
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,596
Leave us alone!

353
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,560
What did she tell you about me?

354
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,603
I didn't say anything to him.
Not a word, I swear... - Nothing?

355
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,100
Then why did you say,
she's told you a lot about me?

356
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,574
Tell me or I'll smash your head!

357
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,035
No, please!

358
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,775
She said you used to beat her up...

359
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,484
when you were kids.

360
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,711
I used to beat her up?

361
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,253
Yes!

362
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,350
- That's all she said?
- Yes.

363
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,254
Then she's said nothing.

364
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,959
You're senior to me...

365
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,464
Doesn't affect me...

366
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:16,068
And yet you call me 'sir'?

367
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,574
That sort of politeness
is too cute for my taste.

368
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,633
Your kid is such a cry baby...

369
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,509
Been pampered a lot, eh?

370
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,271
Mommy walks you to school,
walks you back home...

371
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,049
Your mom had to walk
to school by herself.

372
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,651
She used to tail me all day.
Did you know I'm your uncle?

373
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,522
Are you sure he is your kid?

374
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,396
You can't really trust my sister.

375
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,662
She's fucked half the world
when she was only 15.

376
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,043
Doing the math?

377
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,308
Relax! I was just joking...
He *is* your son.

378
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,380
Stay quiet...

379
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,064
Make it fast!

380
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,226
Why didn't you tell me...

381
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,037
that you were the
housemaid in this house?

382
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,331
While his first wife was alive?

383
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,174
Was she really sick
or you poisoned her?

384
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,246
- Answer.
- Why'd you tie my son?

385
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,339
He talks a lot.

386
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,354
Untie him, please.

387
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,578
What if I hit him?

388
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,548
What if he dies?

389
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,458
Whose life do you want to save?

390
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,324
His or yours?

391
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,592
Answer me!

392
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,598
If I untie him...

393
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,395
and he screams...

394
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,999
I'll have to break his head
open with my carjack.

395
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,136
So tell me...

396
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,676
Was his wife really sick
or you killed her?

397
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,583
Don't be shy...

398
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,715
Were you guys already having fun
while she was alive?

399
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,618
Tell me...

400
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,422
Look what she's saying...

401
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,493
that you guys were sleeping
together before your wife died.

402
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,668
Let's get some detail here...

403
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,565
Where would you guys have sex?

404
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,371
You used to be at work...

405
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,441
and she was here with your sick wife.

406
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,547
So how did you manage to make out'?

407
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,817
I know things my sister can do.

408
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:57,814
NO!

409
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,614
You know nothing about your sister.

410
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,740
How much cash do
you have in the house'?

411
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,413
- Answer me!
- How much do you need'?

412
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,077
- How much do you have'?
- Depends on your need, right'?

413
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,679
I want a million. Do you have?

414
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,251
Don't act smart, how much do you have'?

415
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,793
Not much, actually.

416
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,028
About 1000 or 1200 maybe.

417
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:41,790
Go get it.

418
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,760
What exactly do you want?

419
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,664
Respect...

420
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,639
That your wife doesn't offer,
and your eyes don't show it.

421
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,110
See how quickly you went
from 'Sir' to 'Hey you!'.

422
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,775
- Your uncle is crazy.
- Sorry, I misunderstood you.

423
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,714
Don't scream if he unties.

424
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,252
As if you respect
me now that you know me.

425
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,586
I've personally prepared my sister...

426
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,219
much before she met you.

427
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,385
Thank me for not leaving
a baby inside her.

428
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,485
Look at your lousy face...

429
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,029
You believe everything I say.

430
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:20,660
This is all I have

431
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,062
I cleaned the chicken,
fire up the stove.

432
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,100
Exactly 1200, eh?
Always sure with money.

433
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,171
How much do you have'?

434
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,510
You're loaded man!

435
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:45,420
Let me see!

436
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,231
Need eggs or bread?

437
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,563
Nope.

438
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,492
Isn't sister around?

439
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,333
Sister died!

440
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:58,732
Sister died?

441
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,637
You want to die too?

442
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,266
Do you want to die?

443
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,176
No, sir... l'll come back later.

444
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,437
Hey, where are the red chilies?

445
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:39,740
Over there...

446
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:40,743
Get it!

447
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,557
- Give them to me.
- Why?

448
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,357
What will you do with these?

449
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,621
I'll wear them... Just do as I say.

450
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,721
Give...

451
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,372
How much gold do you have'?

452
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,299
Nothing left anymore.

453
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,236
And the wedding necklace?

454
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,068
Don't have it. I pawned it.

455
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,670
Why? Doesn't he earn enough?

456
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,146
What is it to you?

457
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,405
Eat the food and get out of here.

458
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,745
What he earns is
none of your business.

459
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,178
Don't lecture me...

460
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,488
Chicken needs time to cook.

461
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,257
- What do you want?
- What can you give me?

462
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,189
There's nothing to do around here.

463
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,419
You want to do with me?

464
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,993
Even his face Isn't
worth looking at...

465
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,553
- You want to do that?
- Or this pampered kid of yours?

466
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,622
Let's do it!
It must've been long...

467
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,435
Your son doesn't look
anything like your husband.

468
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,604
- Do you want to do it?
- Nor like you...

469
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,641
Just do it quick and leave.

470
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,540
Right here.. Let's do it.

471
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,044
Get off me!

472
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,307
Come on, take your shirt off...

473
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,211
Let go...

474
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:49,774
Don't look at him.
Come on, touch my bosom!

475
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,146
Let go off me or I'll kill you!

476
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:30,686
Sleight your hand, sever them ties

477
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:36,563
Dip your feet, poison them rivers

478
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:51,637
Man of muck,
are you really this worthy?

479
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,773
Worms crawl up your skin;

480
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,076
you're so damn filthy!

481
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,020
You're so damn filthy!

482
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:05,322
Born to lie, you're truly filthy

483
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,452
SO filthy!

484
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:10,259
Your mind reeks of mould,

485
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,061
you're that filthy!

486
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,467
Your blood is black as soot...

487
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,562
You're that filthy

488
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:21,633
You jab your wounds to pus,

489
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,143
Filthy...

490
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,215
You're so damn filthy!

491
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,350
Filthy...

492
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,081
Sleight your hand,

493
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,627
sever them ties

494
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,219
Dip your feet,

495
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,230
poison them rivers

496
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,160
Image is a lie,

497
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,770
shatter them mirrors

498
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,504
At the amber dawn,

499
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,770
smudge them skies

500
00:48:56,033 --> 00:49:00,982
Rotting from within,
aren't you lonely?

501
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:07,214
Worms crawl up your skin;
you're so damn filthy!

502
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,023
You're so damn filthy!

503
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,721
Born to lie, you're truly filthy

504
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,463
so filthy!

505
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,023
Your mind reeks of mould,

506
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,069
you're that filthy!

507
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,401
Your blood is black as soot

508
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,566
You're that filthy

509
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,601
You jab your wounds to pus,

510
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,340
Filthy...

511
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,013
you're truly filthy

512
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,541
So far I've sent 11
people to Death-God...

513
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,252
Which includes your parents.

514
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,146
Look, I keep an account.

515
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,516
Your mother, my sister, finished...

516
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:25,058
Your dad, who I'm not sure if
he really was yours, finished...

517
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,102
You... What's your name?

518
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,673
Pocket!

519
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,543
Since you're a little one...

520
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,780
If anyone wonders why I killed you...

521
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,405
I'll just say 'He was easy pickings.'

522
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:49,085
Our Police is completely brainless...

523
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,284
You know what I did?

524
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:56,056
I killed someone... then waited...

525
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,461
for the Police to find the body.

526
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,599
When the murder hit the newspaper...

527
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,227
I went and sat outside
the cops station...

528
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:11,272
When cops came and asked me,
"Did you do it?" I said 'Yes'

529
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,511
They asked me to go with them,
I went...

530
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:20,445
Then they took me to be an
idiot and didn't arrest me...

531
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,748
Now whatever I do...

532
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,422
They will never again
see me as suspect.

533
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,293
Right?

534
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,207
There are three victims...

535
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,110
A man, his second wife and a kid.

536
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,481
Victim used to own
a stationery store...

537
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,352
They've been dead for 5 days.

538
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,553
The door's been locked...

539
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,393
and none of the neighbors saw
anyone go in-out the house...

540
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,733
Please vacate the room. All of you.

541
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,660
Torch!

542
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,448
- How much did you add'?
- All of it

543
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,529
Yes, Sir!

544
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,572
No, we locked him
in an abandoned room.

545
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,515
The lock was found broken later...

546
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,345
We don't know where
he is at this point.

547
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,422
Usually the murder locations
are either slums or streets...

548
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,526
But this murder happened
in a low income neighborhood.

549
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,260
Victim's family picture has him in it.

550
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:59,798
An egg-seller is one
of our prime witnesses...

551
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:04,569
He said the man had
a scar across his face.

552
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,502
Yes sir, the same scar.

553
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,563
You're not going to find
anything in this woman...

554
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,267
However much you dig in.

555
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,137
I am God's very own CCT Camera.

556
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,977
What if I get pregnant again?

557
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,552
Nobody gets pregnant
after 3 abortions.

558
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:30,655
Who told you that?

559
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,455
I know it.

560
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,555
But what if I do get pregnant?

561
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,096
Then it's your wish...

562
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,335
Keep the baby, or kill it.
I don't care!

563
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,237
So you still won't use protection?

564
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:57,376
Will you marry me?

565
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,147
What is the matter?

566
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,265
I almost had him...

567
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,305
Who?

568
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,506
Him...

569
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,514
This man killed his sister,
husband and their only son.

570
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,053
Six year old son!

571
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,492
Even you've killed
three babies of mine...

572
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,132
Aren't you afraid of me?

573
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,763
Why?

574
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,337
Because I don't sleep...

575
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,177
I shoot shit up my nose and veins.

576
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,539
I always keep a loaded gun...

577
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,239
If you piss me off...

578
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,173
I can do anything.

579
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,646
When we first met,
what did we agree on?

580
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,280
You remember?

581
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,116
I told you, I don't want anything!

582
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,429
I told you, I don't want marriage.
Didn't I tell you this?

583
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,997
Then what did you say?

584
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,696
"Baby, why so serious?"

585
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:26,302
"I am in for the sex, baby.
Not the marriage."

586
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,568
Didn't you say it?

587
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,337
You want the baby, you keep it...

588
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,672
I don't want it.
What's the worse that'll happen?

589
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:36,978
You won't go in for abortion?

590
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,451
So I will hold this baby like this...

591
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,457
I'll load it,
shove it right here and..

592
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:44,750
One sec..

593
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,424
Hello!

594
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,527
Mom! Yeah... Tell me.

595
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:55,765
Can I talk to dad?

596
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:00,673
Dad!

597
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,667
What do you mean "why"?

598
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,441
You won't change your stubborn ways...

599
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,749
You want to turn me fatherless.

600
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,656
Dad, beer is poison for you...

601
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:21,318
One more sip and I'll
never see you again...

602
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,095
You won't hear from me either.

603
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,460
So it's a promise then?

604
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,803
Don't just say 'love you', dad.
Mean it!

605
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:33,532
Okay... Bye.

606
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,210
What were you saying?

607
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,550
Something with the Gun.. what was it?

608
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,630
At times I feel you
fancy a dangerous death...

609
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,267
May be it's not a death wish...

610
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,506
I could just be enraged
enough to kill you.

611
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,684
Why are you so sexy?

612
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,120
Because you're a loser...

613
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,423
Don't you hit me
or I will crash this car.

614
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:07,500
Hello...

615
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,300
Yes?

616
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,232
Hold him up...

617
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,374
Sir, I can't eat anymore
of these dumplings...

618
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:18,170
Eat...

619
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:22,080
Don't you whine you've
to feed us on the sly...

620
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:25,017
So you're lucky to be
fed by cops now...

621
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:25,779
I'm full

622
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,521
Eat!

623
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,188
Sir's here

624
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,201
Speak...

625
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,638
Sir, his name is Ramana...

626
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:48,070
He keeps calling himself Raman,
Ram and sometimes Raavan.

627
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,608
He said he was looking for a 'partner

628
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,169
I got confused...

629
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:54,673
He said, "What would
Raman be without Raghav."

630
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,810
Is Ramana his real name?

631
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,017
I have his name as
Ramana in my accounts...

632
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,622
I run a small restaurant
around here...

633
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,716
Pawn business on the side.

634
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,720
I offer loans to those
who have been denied by banks...

635
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,323
Honest, I only offer loans.
No dirty business, sir!

636
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,664
Your men were torture-feeding
me pancakes all this while.

637
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,635
I am going to throw up...

638
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,366
When was the last you saw him?

639
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:22,141
He met me two weeks back.

640
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,402
And after that no
communication whatsoever.

641
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,672
The first time he deposited a lot
of jewelllery as collateral...

642
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,481
I gave him the money.
Kept his jewellery.

643
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:36,013
He's bad at math and
that's profitable for me.

644
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:40,725
Had I known he was 'wanted, I'd
have personally called you...

645
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,023
What does he know?

646
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,420
Say it...

647
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,725
Your men told me that
he's killed someone...

648
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:50,093
Has that person died?

649
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:59,271
Did he ever tell you
how he'll find 'Raghav?

650
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,375
Last I spoke to him,
he said he's found him...

651
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,013
but he said that Raghav doesn't
know he is 'my Raghav'

652
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,293
I am clean and honest man...

653
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:22,330
I stay away from criminaIs.

654
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,069
Sir, please... Shut up!

655
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,007
Sir, this guy identified
him with a photograph...

656
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:32,509
I didn't lead him on. He told me the
'Raman Raghav' story by himself.

657
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:33,672
Thought I'd let you know...

658
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:39,509
Get lost!

659
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:43,515
Raman needs Raghav
and Raghav needs Raman...

660
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,425
<i>Mr. Asst. Commissioner!</i>

661
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,654
Hello!

662
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,158
- A FAMILY OF 3 SLAUGHTERED-

663
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,367
One tea please...

664
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,542
Are you a homo?

665
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,449
What's with those earrings?

666
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,513
Don't they look pretty?

667
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,784
So you have sex for money'?
or just pleasure?

668
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,454
How do you prefer'?

669
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,223
All of it up your a**?
Or a blow will do?

670
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,158
Wipe that smirk of yours...

671
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,056
or I'll smash your teeth in...

672
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,101
Didn't you read the papers?

673
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,038
"A family of 3, slaughtered"

674
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,673
She was my sister...
was disrespectful like you...

675
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,676
had to put her in her place.

676
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,376
This earring is her penance.

677
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,184
If you still don't get who I am,
I can explain in private...

678
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,718
money or pleasure, as you like it.

679
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:46,066
Ma'am...

680
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,605
I kept the food in the fridge...

681
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:48,368
Can I go?

682
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,471
I will come at 7 tomorrow...

683
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:51,439
<i>Okay!</i>

684
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,477
AIso, sir's medication was
in the bathroom lying down...

685
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,040
I kept it in that chest.

686
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,016
Okay, you can leave...

687
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,486
I am taking the house keys with me...

688
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,426
Ma'am, I understood that...

689
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:57,059
You came back from buying veggies...

690
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,127
- and stood by the door, right?
- Yes

691
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,969
And you saw the man
sitting with your grandson?

692
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,566
- He was feeding and putting him to sleep?
- Yes

693
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,637
- So you must've seen his face, right?
- Yes

694
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,014
Can you identify if it was him?

695
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,048
No!

696
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,740
- It wasn't him?
- No

697
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,086
See it carefully... Was it him?

698
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:15,246
I have seen...
I assure you it wasn't him.

699
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,981
If the man in this pic had a
long scar across his face...

700
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:21,084
No way... This is not the Killer.

701
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,060
Yeah?

702
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:28,727
Okay. Hold him up. We're on our way.

703
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,534
It was indeed the same man.

704
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,094
Like I said it wasn't this man.

705
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:33,706
Sir, we found him.

706
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,555
Ramana, I have checked the accounts...

707
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,218
You're due to pay the interest.

708
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:58,589
You already got the money
from your previous transactions.

709
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,565
I've made a note
in my diary on the 19th.

710
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,466
You gave me 500.

711
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:07,164
And on the 24th of June,
you gave me 1500.

712
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:10,136
So 5 and 15 makes it 25.

713
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:14,209
Keep 600 as interest and
give the remaining 2000 to me.

714
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:16,209
Which world are you living in?

715
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,377
15 and 5 means 20-hundred, that
is 2-thousand, not 20-thousand

716
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,615
2 thousand is what I want

717
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,455
Okay, but there will be an interest

718
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,646
Why?

719
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,422
See, I borrowed 15...

720
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:28,324
And 5 before that...

721
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,023
Okay, so I borrowed 5 and then 15.

722
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,393
So, how much is 15 and 5?

723
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:32,659
15 and 5 is 20

724
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:33,693
What the hell!

725
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,231
Hear me out.

726
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,261
- How much is this'?
- 5

727
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:47,669
s, 7, s, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15

728
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:51,743
15 and 5... 20... 20-hundred...

729
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:52,610
Z-thousand

730
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:56,155
How? See... 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

731
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:59,749
11,12,13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20...

732
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:00,584
It's 20. Not 2?

733
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,219
Twenty hundred. that is two thousand!

734
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,319
That's what I'm saying. 2000!

735
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,695
20,19,18,17,16,15,14,

736
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,729
13, 12, 11, 10, 9, s, 7, s,

737
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,630
5, 4, 3, 2, 1... 20-hundred.

738
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,198
- Z-thousand!
- Okay, I want 2000.

739
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:17,136
Okay, keep that 2000,
and give me these goggles.

740
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,235
- These?
- Yes.

741
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,009
You keep the 2000.

742
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:24,313
So, did you meet your Raghav?

743
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:27,752
Yes, he took good care of me.

744
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,181
What's up?

745
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,320
Don't see you outside the
police station these days.

746
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,156
Some more murders?

747
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:41,325
Not at all. We just wanted
to hang with you.

748
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,170
Come, let's have tea.

749
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,503
Move it!

750
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:01,382
Get hold of him!

751
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:33,543
Yes?

752
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,082
I am on my way

753
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:44,756
I'll look here.

754
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,499
You check over there.

755
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,446
What happened?

756
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:03,411
Why are these cops here?

757
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:05,575
Come down... The cops are gone.

758
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,208
Sir, did you see a man
with a scar on his face?

759
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:56,099
Dad comes to Bombay every month...

760
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,662
I can't skip work and pay his
holiness a visit every month!

761
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:03,703
Mom... at least listen to me!

762
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,442
I'm not a kid anymore.

763
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:10,209
Family and marriage is not for me.

764
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:13,486
It's the best if I
am caught and jailed...

765
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,579
Dad would be the
one losing face, not me.

766
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:19,024
Mom, for the last time,
don't make me promise.

767
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:23,060
Stop yelling, I promise,
I'll see him. Okay?

768
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:24,523
Mom, listen...

769
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:30,662
there's this girl I know,
her maid has been murdered...

770
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,330
I'm busy with that case. I'll
see dad if I find time. Happy?

771
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:37,700
Alright.

772
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,510
Take care of your knees.

773
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,115
Sir...

774
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,513
We couldn't find him, sir.

775
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,684
We couldn't find him in this maze.

776
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,528
The maid had my house keys.

777
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:00,061
Get forensic team to look for keys
- It's a single key.

778
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:02,760
So I am just someone you know?

779
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:05,066
As in?

780
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:08,072
You were telling your
mother on the phone...

781
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,032
"this girl I know"

782
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,412
What should've I said?

783
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:17,080
The truth, maybe.

784
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,118
That you're the girl I sleep with?

785
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:23,320
Oh, I thought you never sleep.

786
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:25,420
I've never seen you sleeping.

787
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,092
Cut the crap!

788
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,291
You decide right now..

789
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,360
If you want to grieve
your maids death...

790
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,095
Or throw cheap sarcasm at me?

791
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:43,804
Are you my steady girlfriend?

792
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:45,404
No.

793
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,570
That woman on the phone
is my exclusive' mother!

794
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,345
And I am her exclusive' son.

795
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,714
And for her,
you're just somebody I know.

796
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,583
You have a problem with that?

797
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:06,293
I think you have a problem with that.

798
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:07,356
I Will...

799
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,298
Walk madam to the car.

800
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,041
Please...

801
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,341
Hello Mam!

802
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:37,092
Sir... Ramanna's shirt...
had this diary...

803
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:41,327
It has details of people
he's murdered so far

804
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:47,368
Why... when... all the details.

805
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:39,278
Tell his ghost that 15
and 5 makes it 20, not 2.

806
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:17,317
Oh my god!

807
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:47,619
Hey buddy! How you've been?

808
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,514
Get a glass of water

809
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:51,521
What's up?

810
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:53,523
Oh, that's Violet.

811
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,689
My friend's daughter...
You couldn't recognize her?

812
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:01,961
Remember my friend at the movie
theatre I used to work? Never mind.

813
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,662
Where've you been?

814
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:05,033
What's up with you?

815
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:08,268
I work here in the day. At night
I'm a security guard in a mall.

816
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,644
All the kids want to work at the mall.

817
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:15,175
Showed them the "Shopping mall
sweatshop" film, by Vasanthbalan

818
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:17,139
to scare them from
working in the malIs...

819
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:18,382
I even said that one day...

820
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,620
the man who smashes
heads will come visit.

821
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,750
Remember how you
smashed that dog's head?

822
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:31,197
What was that you said,"Raman,
keep your Raghav away!"

823
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:34,290
Listen...
I came to you for something eIse.

824
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,703
I need an iron rod...

825
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,438
- I bought a shack in the burbs.
- Okay.

826
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,568
I need the rod for masonry work...
to redo walIs.

827
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,597
I want to get this moulded

828
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,331
Sure.

829
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:17,075
I want it bent here. Need a snout.

830
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,406
How much?

831
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:21,673
40 rupees.

832
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:26,014
There's 40.

833
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:28,012
But I want it right away.

834
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:30,247
We can't do it right now.
It's lunchtime.

835
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:31,583
No way. I'm in a hurry.

836
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:35,561
I need this in an hour
or my boss will fire me.

837
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:38,188
It's lunchtime.
We've put our gear away.

838
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:40,629
Okay, have your lunch. I'll wait here.

839
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,531
- Yes, wait for us.
- Okay.

840
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,487
Wait! What are you doing?

841
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,419
Told you, it's lunchtime.

842
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:07,119
- I want it right now!
- You'll ruin our gear!

843
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,319
Give me now!
I don't have time to spare.

844
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:11,990
- Just wait for 5 minutes.
- I want it right now.

845
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:15,228
If I had time to spare,
I'd be an iron smith.

846
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,459
Pull the car over there!

847
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:52,763
You guys carry on, I'll take a cab.

848
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:53,528
OK Sir!

849
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,471
I remember, you said first
Monday and last Monday.

850
01:28:56,998 --> 01:29:00,241
That month had five Mondays.
Normally, it's just four, right'?

851
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:01,243
Yes, four.

852
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:05,444
In the confusion of 1st and 4th,
I missed the auspicious day.

853
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,251
Come in.

854
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,384
Touch his feet for blessings.

855
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:13,316
Very proud of you!

856
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:14,685
Do you remember him?

857
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:18,362
Head of training for the
'Public Services Commission' exam?

858
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:20,698
Take Guru's blessings too.

859
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:23,301
God bless you, son!

860
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:25,629
Sit over there.

861
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:32,739
Come, sit.

862
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:37,271
What's with those sunglasses?

863
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,742
Trying to be too cool? Take them off!

864
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,380
Take them off, NOW!

865
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:43,689
Hello?

866
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:48,583
Something wrong with your eyes?

867
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:49,593
No.

868
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:50,722
What?

869
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:52,525
Nothing. I haven't slept enough.

870
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:53,588
Haven't slept enough?

871
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:57,628
Sir, does anyone ever sleep
in this mad city like Bombay?

872
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,299
- Especially, the police force.
- Put them back on.

873
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,110
Why aren't you sleeping enough?

874
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:12,449
Come over here.

875
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:14,311
Over here.

876
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:17,715
Come closer.

877
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:26,588
Don't move.

878
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:32,427
How will you ever get sleep?

879
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:36,765
Go sit outside.
I'll deal with you later.

880
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,070
I don't know how to discipline him.

881
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:42,807
Tried to school him a lot.

882
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,781
Being a police officer,
he is into drugs!

883
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:49,311
If he gets caught,
it will turn into a big scandal.

884
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,715
He'll be suspended... imprisoned...

885
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,623
and the shame he'll bring us!
The media will have a field day.

886
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:57,791
When he was a kid,
I caught him smoking weed once.

887
01:30:58,219 --> 01:30:59,630
I beat him up all day.

888
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:01,562
I had a thick leather belt.

889
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:04,125
I whipped him till
his whole body turned red.

890
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,035
He never smoked up after that.

891
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:10,769
Disgusting to see scales of
white powder in his nose.

892
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:43,706
Like it?

893
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:49,046
Should I get you
transferred closer home?

894
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,146
Father and son can snort together.

895
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,278
What say?

896
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,261
Where's that Nigerian?

897
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:19,327
Upstairs.

898
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:53,569
Hey!!

899
01:33:56,764 --> 01:33:59,244
Hold it!

900
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:07,447
Put the gun down.

901
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,486
He doesn't understand English?

902
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:13,489
<i>No</i>

903
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:21,558
Tell him to put the gun down.

904
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:29,669
...or my team will beat him till he
speaks all 480 languages of India

905
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:32,368
Tell him!

906
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:43,581
You have your passport, right?

907
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:45,246
Yes, I do.

908
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,187
Pick your passport,
pack the bags and sod off.

909
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:53,055
This isn't right.

910
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:56,295
What was his mistake?

911
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:05,338
Should I tell you what's right?

912
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:14,518
Spreading filth in my country...

913
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:16,987
and lecturing me on morality!

914
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:38,140
Bloody drug addict!

915
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:43,475
We never said no to you...

916
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:45,276
Still you killed him!

917
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:10,991
Am I blocking you?

918
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,731
Grocery cart... for you.

919
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:14,729
Thanks.

920
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:20,678
I'll manage.

921
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:23,477
Don't worry, madam.
I work here... at your service.

922
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,610
- I'll manage.
- I said do not worry.

923
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:36,761
Do you know...

924
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:39,060
It's both Dussehra (HINDU)
and Muharram (MUSLIM) today.

925
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:44,435
While the Muslims mourn,
Hindus celebrate.

926
01:37:44,658 --> 01:37:48,071
This year, the festival of Ganesha
and Bakr-Eid coincided too!

927
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:50,141
People sin so much...

928
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:53,509
...that they need
religion to hide behind.

929
01:37:54,068 --> 01:37:56,173
It's a carnival of
religions out there.

930
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,015
...so much that even God is
paraded on streets.

931
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:03,585
Each religion flaunting
its might of majority.

932
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:06,955
But we... real children of
God... converse with him.

933
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:08,550
Do you converse with God?

934
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,521
Do you? I definitely do.

935
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:16,464
For us blessed ones,
it's the year of holy union.

936
01:38:18,192 --> 01:38:18,670
Okay.

937
01:39:01,168 --> 01:39:03,580
- WI T H LOVE-

938
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:26,003
Limitless sky...
The vast unfathomed sky.

939
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:32,094
My feet clasped on a cloud,
held on to its cottony shroud.

940
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:48,984
The path of choice,
like an aimless happy river.

941
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:54,249
Relentless and undeterred,
my shadow moved the sun.

942
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:06,342
Then the smoke blinded me...

943
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:12,146
I fell unhooked from a star.

944
01:40:12,573 --> 01:40:17,573
Into a bottomless well, a rope
let loose, a bucket in free fall.

945
01:40:24,385 --> 01:40:32,600
That aimless happy river...

946
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:38,242
dried out in a vapor...

947
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:44,614
soul left like wind to paper.

948
01:40:46,507 --> 01:40:54,517
Limitless sky.
The vast unfathomed sky.

949
01:40:55,115 --> 01:41:00,326
Wiped out like a child's dream.

950
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:06,730
Night devours the morning beam.

951
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:13,028
Then the smoke blinded me,
I fell unhooked from a star.

952
01:41:19,006 --> 01:41:24,006
Into a bottomless well, a rope
let loose, a bucket in free fall.

953
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:37,365
Burnt as a molten ring,
flying off a torn wing

954
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:40,432
What gives?

955
01:41:41,662 --> 01:41:48,705
Hiding from eyes, losing to lies.

956
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:52,379
What gives?

957
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:07,497
Hi

958
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:54,143
Who's she?

959
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:30,441
What are you upto?

960
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:34,279
Don't look back.

961
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,016
Shut up!

962
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,428
<i>Motherf*****!</i>

963
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:46,113
Hi Piya!

964
01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:47,783
Are you OK Ankita?

965
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:17,580
Turn it off!

966
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:20,386
Turn it off or I'll
smash it into pieces!

967
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:25,691
Why did you get her here?

968
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,428
Can't I bring anyone here?

969
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:30,499
There are others who come here too.

970
01:45:31,124 --> 01:45:32,068
Nobody comes here.

971
01:45:33,694 --> 01:45:34,672
Nobody comes here!

972
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,071
Should I give you detailed list?

973
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:39,473
Who all come to you
and where all you go.

974
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,579
Whose car comes to pick you.

975
01:45:41,702 --> 01:45:45,115
And those shows you perform
for Dubai Sheikhs.

976
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:47,083
This is my house!
Get the hell out of here!

977
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,312
Damn woman!

978
01:45:53,246 --> 01:45:56,284
Don't ever talk to me like my dad!

979
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:13,268
Where the hell is my MDMA?

980
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:18,983
Where is the MD?

981
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:20,344
Did you finish it off?

982
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:22,076
Simmy, did you'?

983
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,754
Look, I'm not a nice
guy like you think I am.

984
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:26,591
I'll kill you!

985
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,524
Get out of here with your girlfriend!

986
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:32,287
And take your garbage along!

987
01:46:32,352 --> 01:46:35,231
What did I ask?
What the hell did I ask?

988
01:46:35,288 --> 01:46:36,631
Where is the MD?

989
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,192
You should know where it is!

990
01:46:38,358 --> 01:46:39,735
I don't bother to look at your stuff.

991
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:42,233
I told you the last time too.
You finished it off.

992
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,398
Idiot wears sunglasses at night!

993
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:46,102
Damn woman!!

994
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:50,110
Never talk to me in
that patronizing tone!

995
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:10,327
Simmy!

996
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:12,397
Ankita!

997
01:47:12,559 --> 01:47:19,033
Ankita, open the door.
Open the damn door!

998
01:47:41,021 --> 01:47:42,056
Ankita.

999
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:48,065
I can do anything to
you and get away with it.

1000
01:47:48,328 --> 01:47:52,606
So be calm and slide your phone
to me without turning it off.

1001
01:47:54,367 --> 01:47:58,213
It's all cool, Ankita. Slide the
phone from under the door.

1002
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:06,055
Ankita, slide the damn phone now!

1003
01:48:11,117 --> 01:48:12,357
Please!

1004
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:17,091
Shut up. Calm down!

1005
01:48:17,357 --> 01:48:21,635
I won't harm you, Ankita.
Relax and lie down.

1006
01:54:39,172 --> 01:54:39,650
Sir...

1007
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:43,643
If I wouldn't have lost him that day,

1008
01:54:44,444 --> 01:54:45,514
...madam would've been alive today.

1009
01:54:47,714 --> 01:54:49,785
It's all my fault.

1010
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:58,255
Tea.

1011
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:00,627
How much sugar did you put?

1012
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:02,563
Two spoons full.

1013
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:04,032
Cardamom?

1014
01:56:04,524 --> 01:56:05,468
Yes.

1015
01:56:06,292 --> 01:56:07,396
Cinnamon?

1016
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:08,698
Yes, that too.

1017
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:10,134
I was just checking.

1018
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:14,307
- May I leave?
- Yes

1019
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:27,385
What is this man?

1020
01:56:28,014 --> 01:56:29,084
Let's go sir!

1021
01:56:53,373 --> 01:56:55,444
So... why escape, and now surrender?

1022
01:56:56,075 --> 01:56:57,053
Sir?

1023
01:56:58,244 --> 01:57:00,019
Is he really required?

1024
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,624
Alright, what do you want to know?

1025
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:07,596
You tell me.

1026
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:10,425
I've confessed before
and I stand by it.

1027
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:14,168
I've seen everything in life...

1028
01:57:15,294 --> 01:57:16,705
except the noose...

1029
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:19,137
that a man makes for himself.

1030
01:57:20,533 --> 01:57:22,979
Such a death fascinates me.

1031
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:26,247
Death... a father offers his son.

1032
01:57:27,473 --> 01:57:29,248
A mother offers her daughter.

1033
01:57:29,308 --> 01:57:30,378
...death a man offers himself.

1034
01:57:30,676 --> 01:57:33,247
Because none have the courage
to embrace their dark side.

1035
01:57:33,613 --> 01:57:35,684
I merely offer them
a release from that fear.

1036
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:39,291
Why did you kill Smrutika?

1037
01:57:39,485 --> 01:57:40,520
Simmy?

1038
01:57:41,521 --> 01:57:43,262
I liked watching her.

1039
01:57:44,323 --> 01:57:46,030
The thing is...

1040
01:57:47,126 --> 01:57:48,571
I was too drugged.

1041
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:52,072
I needed a woman.
Everyone needs a woman, right?

1042
01:57:52,765 --> 01:57:55,507
Battles of Ramayana and Mahabharata
too were caused by women.

1043
01:57:56,436 --> 01:57:58,347
Ravana, a purist Brahmin,
turned into a villain.

1044
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:02,147
To abduct a woman, he actually
designed an airplane!

1045
01:58:02,942 --> 01:58:05,115
If not for them women...
we wouldn't have had airplanes.

1046
01:58:06,045 --> 01:58:07,991
Every time I see an airplane...

1047
01:58:08,548 --> 01:58:09,618
I tell myself...

1048
01:58:10,116 --> 01:58:11,026
"Hey Ramana...!"

1049
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:15,088
"Yet another Ravana is flying
off with someone’s Sita"

1050
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:17,131
"Time to bring him
back to the ground!"

1051
01:58:18,024 --> 01:58:19,196
I keep a count...

1052
01:58:19,525 --> 01:58:21,664
of the planes that fly
across the sky in a day.

1053
01:58:22,195 --> 01:58:24,106
Right above us. We hardly notice.

1054
01:58:24,464 --> 01:58:25,704
The more the planes...

1055
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:28,579
as many Ravens, Sitas and Rams.

1056
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:31,373
You've come here
to narrate the Ramayana?

1057
01:58:31,637 --> 01:58:34,675
Sir, will you ask him to leave?

1058
01:58:35,441 --> 01:58:37,216
Just doesn't relish conversations.

1059
01:58:39,178 --> 01:58:40,282
What a crushing bore!

1060
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,184
What happened last night?

1061
01:58:43,216 --> 01:58:45,628
You needed a woman...
so you killed Smrutika.

1062
01:58:45,985 --> 01:58:47,225
And I did score one.

1063
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:50,395
20 something buxom bomb!

1064
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:53,560
What was her name... uh, Ankita.

1065
01:58:54,193 --> 01:58:57,436
But I didn't have a
place to have sex with her.

1066
01:58:58,064 --> 01:59:01,273
So I took her to Simmy's house.
I had the keys.

1067
01:59:03,069 --> 01:59:04,548
Simmy opened the door...

1068
01:59:05,037 --> 01:59:07,677
I pushed her aside and rushed
Ankita into the bedroom.

1069
01:59:08,107 --> 01:59:09,415
I locked the room...

1070
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:12,022
and slapped Ankita real hard!

1071
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:14,354
I was so wasted...

1072
01:59:15,047 --> 01:59:16,185
...my penis wouldn't get hard.

1073
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:19,086
...and Ankita wouldn't stop giggling.

1074
01:59:19,352 --> 01:59:22,333
So I slammed her face
against the wall! Real hard!

1075
01:59:22,388 --> 01:59:23,594
Step out.

1076
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:25,660
Step out.

1077
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:27,329
Sir?

1078
01:59:29,061 --> 01:59:30,267
Leave us alone.

1079
02:00:19,345 --> 02:00:21,256
What do you want?

1080
02:00:22,114 --> 02:00:22,785
Nothing.

1081
02:00:23,416 --> 02:00:26,124
I just wanted to surrender.

1082
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:26,721
Why?

1083
02:00:27,286 --> 02:00:28,560
I got my high.

1084
02:00:30,456 --> 02:00:32,197
What gives you a high?

1085
02:00:32,758 --> 02:00:33,702
Drugs?

1086
02:00:35,094 --> 02:00:37,438
I have a whole brick
of coke in my bag.

1087
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:40,040
The one from Simmy's drawer.

1088
02:00:40,466 --> 02:00:42,070
What the hell do you want?

1089
02:00:42,368 --> 02:00:43,574
Why are you doing this?

1090
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:47,048
What's your game?
Why did you come here?

1091
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,317
To look into your eyes!

1092
02:00:51,377 --> 02:00:55,723
No drug can match the high
of locking eyes with you.

1093
02:01:26,379 --> 02:01:31,795
When I was a kid, I was told
the "Raman Raghav" story.

1094
02:01:33,219 --> 02:01:36,029
The act of killing in itself is
an unparalleled adventure...

1095
02:01:38,691 --> 02:01:41,035
Everyone has their moments
when they ache to kill...

1096
02:01:41,093 --> 02:01:43,801
...and they do find opportunities.
Like in a civil war... riots...

1097
02:01:45,798 --> 02:01:47,539
they merely vent hiding in a mob

1098
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,307
like in Syria...

1099
02:01:49,535 --> 02:01:53,574
People cross borders to
unleash their inner animal.

1100
02:01:55,107 --> 02:01:58,316
But I kill... alone

1101
02:01:58,511 --> 02:02:00,252
with no hesitation...

1102
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:01,758
No regrets whatsoever!

1103
02:02:02,615 --> 02:02:07,291
I've killed no man,
woman or child by accident.

1104
02:02:07,353 --> 02:02:08,627
I can guarantee that.

1105
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:11,727
Neither killed
hiding behind a uniform...

1106
02:02:12,124 --> 02:02:16,664
...nor a religion or
the cloak of humanity...

1107
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:18,474
I Killed...

1108
02:02:19,365 --> 02:02:20,708
...because I wanted to kill.

1109
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:25,012
I kill... like we eat,
shit, pray, love...

1110
02:02:25,771 --> 02:02:28,047
...naturally.

1111
02:02:33,245 --> 02:02:37,091
So... you killed Smrutika?

1112
02:02:37,783 --> 02:02:39,490
Why... did you'?

1113
02:02:40,252 --> 02:02:46,066
I give you my word:
Simmy's death is on me.

1114
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:52,741
But there's still a glitch
that can ruin all of this.

1115
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:54,776
...Ankita

1116
02:02:56,035 --> 02:02:59,812
She saw what happened last night...

1117
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:04,150
And Ankita must not die by accident.

1118
02:03:05,578 --> 02:03:11,119
She has to be killed...

1119
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:13,259
...intentionally

1120
02:03:16,088 --> 02:03:17,465
What's in it for you?

1121
02:03:18,424 --> 02:03:19,732
Contentment...

1122
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:24,004
My journey ends here...

1123
02:03:24,764 --> 02:03:27,267
Raman found his Raghav...

1124
02:03:29,602 --> 02:03:30,603
Why me?

1125
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:31,571
What?

1126
02:03:33,739 --> 02:03:34,717
<i>Why ME?</i>

1127
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:36,619
It's...

1128
02:03:37,576 --> 02:03:39,681
It's our destiny.

1129
02:03:40,179 --> 02:03:42,625
Each one in this world
has someone... somewhere...

1130
02:03:42,681 --> 02:03:44,456
that completes him

1131
02:03:45,117 --> 02:03:47,063
The mistake we make is in assuming...

1132
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:49,360
that soul-mate has to be a woman

1133
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:50,423
Perhaps...

1134
02:03:52,525 --> 02:03:55,335
it was my luck or your misfortune,

1135
02:03:56,128 --> 02:04:00,543
that you arrived as a good
omen on my first kill.

1136
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,590
Uncle!

1137
02:04:19,552 --> 02:04:20,587
'Uncle', as we'd like to call him...

1138
02:04:21,487 --> 02:04:23,364
used to bugger me as a child...

1139
02:04:24,223 --> 02:04:25,668
made me work like a dog...

1140
02:04:26,492 --> 02:04:28,631
One day,
he ran off with all our money.

1141
02:04:29,328 --> 02:04:30,705
I found him years later.

1142
02:04:31,564 --> 02:04:33,100
And killed him...

1143
02:04:34,033 --> 02:04:36,013
Before I could think of a way out...

1144
02:04:36,402 --> 02:04:37,380
Uncle!

1145
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:39,210
You walked in... a serendipity

1146
02:04:40,673 --> 02:04:42,550
Uncle's gone out. He'll be here.

1147
02:04:43,075 --> 02:04:45,783
Who are you? Have we met before?

1148
02:05:00,626 --> 02:05:04,472
While you wiped your fingerprints,
you removed mine too...

1149
02:05:07,967 --> 02:05:10,311
Then you removed Uncle's phone too...

1150
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:13,109
and next day you came back on the
scene as the investigating officer

1151
02:05:14,673 --> 02:05:16,550
Sir, you shaved your beard?

1152
02:05:16,609 --> 02:05:19,055
It was love at the first sight.

1153
02:05:19,245 --> 02:05:23,284
I knew then...
you were the one to set me free.

1154
02:05:23,716 --> 02:05:28,495
...but you were searching
for your freedom in a woman.

1155
02:05:32,024 --> 02:05:34,368
I've been waiting since that moment...

1156
02:05:35,761 --> 02:05:38,435
There's no salvation
without penance...

1157
02:05:39,331 --> 02:05:43,302
It is that divine patience that
brings your soul-mate to you.

1158
02:05:43,636 --> 02:05:46,776
The rest are just passing clouds...

1159
02:05:47,773 --> 02:05:49,753
I've done my duty...

1160
02:05:50,743 --> 02:05:52,723
...it's your turn now.

1161
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:57,056
Cigarette?

1162
02:06:31,083 --> 02:06:32,585
Matches...

1163
02:07:18,697 --> 02:07:20,108
Who is it?

1164
02:07:26,338 --> 02:07:27,681
Who is it?

1165
02:07:57,469 --> 02:07:58,641
Who is it?
