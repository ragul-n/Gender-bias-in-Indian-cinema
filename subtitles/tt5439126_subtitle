1
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:17,625
"Lord Ganesha!
The one who removes obstacles!"

2
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:25,708
"Oh, Krishna!
The dark complexioned Krishna!"

3
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:30,250
"There is nobody who can't
see you." - Hey, Modu Mutti!

4
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,166
You have become so fair.

5
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,125
Who is that?
- It's me, Kannan.

6
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,541
This scoundrel has appeared,
the moment I finished my prayers.

7
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,375
Will you not let me
live in peace? - How are you?

8
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,833
'How are you?'
Why are you here?

9
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,875
Why do you ask like that?
- Don't say a word!

10
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,208
How long are you
going to stay here?

11
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,916
I'll be here for seven days.
- You can stay even for a year.

12
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,500
But this shop will remain closed
until you are here.

13
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,625
Even I will not be there.

14
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,291
Modu Mutti!
- Leave me alone.

15
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,000
I've faced enough troubles
because of you.

16
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,291
I have never seen Kannan.

17
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,291
I do not know Kannan.

18
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,583
I have never seen Kannan,
the old building contractor.

19
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,250
Is this Kannan?

20
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,208
He has changed so much.
- He is rich now.

21
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,166
Yes.
- "Walking through the forests.."

22
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,250
Go, go, go, go.

23
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,750
Who is that? Who is honking like that?
- Can't he see the cattle?

24
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:21,125
Go, move, go. - Catch the cow.
- The cow is running away in fear.

25
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,041
Catch the cow.
I will be right back.

26
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,500
Who is honking like this
in the forest? - Let's check.

27
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,041
Crazy fellow! There is no one inside.
I don't see anyone inside.

28
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,041
What is this? Whose car is it?
- Uncle, I am here.

29
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,708
Have you lost it?

30
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,750
We are grazing the cattle.
- He looks like our Kannan.

31
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,041
What? Kannan?
You are not Kannan, are you?

32
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,541
Yes, he is Kannan indeed.
- I am Kannan.

33
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,583
Aren't you Nalla Thambi?
- I am not Nalla Thambi.

34
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,708
I am Chendurapandi.

35
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:45,041
I'll not come. I'm going on a pilgrimage.
- I've never met you.

36
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,333
I do not know who you are.
Leave me.

37
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,791
I was not born here.
- Nalla Thambi!

38
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,000
Wait! Listen to me.
- I am not from this town. Oh, God!

39
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,416
There is no connection
between Kannan and me.

40
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,416
<i><font color="white">They are all my friends.</i></font>

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,250
<i><font color="white">They are running away from me
and I am responsible for that.</i></font>

42
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,750
<i><font color="white">They have suffered a lot
because of me.</i></font>

43
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,791
<i><font color="white">Just like them, my village
has also changed a lot.</i></font>

44
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,000
<i><font color="white">But my feelings
haven't changed at all.</i></font>

45
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,750
<i><font color="white">Traveling across the globe</i></font>

46
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,500
<i><font color="white">and seeing the many wonders
of the world</i></font>

47
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,208
<i><font color="white">doesn't give me as much happiness</i></font>

48
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,083
<i><font color="white">as standing in front of my house</i></font>

49
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,458
<i><font color="white">and looking at Revathy's house does.</i></font>

50
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,416
<i><font color="white">I'm not at all a serious kind of a person.
- Two years ago.</i></font>

51
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,166
Oh, Lord Ram!

52
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,000
Why do I have such stupid friends?

53
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,833
Hello!
- Play the song.

54
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,000
Since they don't let me
sleep peacefully at home

55
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,541
I've come to the wedding hall.

56
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,041
You are disturbing my sleep here too.

57
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,000
Please play that song
for one last time today.

58
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:10,041
Because he is in love,
he is ruining my sleep.

59
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,416
"Oh! My heart is beating."

60
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,458
"The sky is freezing."

61
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,625
"There is lightning in my house."

62
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,958
"The moonlight is falling on me."

63
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,500
"The moment I saw you"

64
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,625
"I froze and could not digest
my food."

65
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,958
She's all come dressed up
just to entice me. - What?

66
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:49,000
1, 2, 3, 4.

67
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,041
"The rooster sounds like"

68
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,958
"it is calling out your name."

69
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,208
Pour the whole bucket of water on me
and make the drawing too.

70
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,833
Hey!
- Why did he have to come now?

71
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,875
Hey, you! Come fast,
I need to have coffee.

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,666
You're talking as if you've to go
to office after drinking coffee!

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,708
"The moonlight is falling on me."

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,041
Kannan!

75
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,000
What is it? - Will you get
a pumpkin flower for me?

76
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,250
A pumpkin flower?
It is available everywhere.

77
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,791
Give me two minutes.

78
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,750
Is this the way to treat me?

79
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,041
Run!

80
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,000
Be careful.

81
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,541
Give me that flower.

82
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,416
No, I will not give it to you.
Get lost!

83
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,000
You should not speak like that.

84
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,166
Please kid, give me the flower.

85
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,375
Take it.

86
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,041
Good girl.

87
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,375
The sun has risen.

88
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,250
This cow dung is way more
beautiful than your drawing.

89
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,958
You need a flower for this!

90
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,833
She will be impressed
as soon as she sees it.

91
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,625
Uncle! Those people
are blocking the path

92
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,916
and are building a fence.

93
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,833
Why are you shouting? We will break
the fence and kill them.

94
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,208
Uncle, ask our men to get
their vehicles and follow me.

95
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,333
Let's decide it once and for all today!
- Don't forget to kill those people

96
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,125
who have built the fence.
- Arumugam, get in.

97
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,458
The case is still going on
in the court.

98
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,416
In spite of that,
somebody is building a fence!

99
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,875
How dare he!

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,958
Take out the vehicle, I will come too.
- Brother! Come on!

101
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,625
Do not have a conversation,
just break the fence!

102
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,958
Get in. Get in.

103
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,166
All of them are going.
I should escape. - You!

104
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,791
All of you go, sir.
- You come too.

105
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,333
<i><font color="white">He's talking as if all of us
are going on a trip to Ooty!</i></font>

106
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,875
My stomach is upset.
I will get down. Please.

107
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,625
<i><font color="white">They are all standing.
There will definitely be a fight today.</i></font>

108
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,208
Why are you creating problems
early in the morning?

109
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,666
Don't you have anything else to do?

110
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,041
With whose permission
have you built the fence here?

111
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,291
It is my place. I will build the fence.
Who are you to question me?

112
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,791
There's a case pending in the court
regarding the ownership of this place.

113
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,416
Then how can you say
that it is your place?

114
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,375
It is my place
until the court passes a judgment.

115
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,208
I will do whatever I want.
Who are you to question me?

116
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,041
Just because you say it,
doesn't make it right.

117
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,083
Just because you've so many men to back you up,
doesn't mean you can say anything you want.

118
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,250
You are such a lowly man.
- Give me the stick.

119
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,958
There is no use talking to
someone so useless.

120
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,541
Don't spare them!

121
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,041
Why are you just standing around?
Hit them!

122
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,333
Come on!

123
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,875
Come on!

124
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,000
Perumal, don't spare them!

125
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,750
Kannan, they are beating up
our people so badly.

126
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,416
Why are you just watching? - You get beaten up
by your wife. Why did you come here? Get lost!

127
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,916
Hit him!
- Leave me. Don't hit me.

128
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:15,291
I'm on your side.
- How dare you build the fence!

129
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,541
Enough, let's go!

130
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,458
They are killing us!

131
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,791
Chase them away.

132
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Break the fence.

133
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,750
I don't want to see you here again.

134
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,166
Remove it.

135
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,416
I wonder, what happened.

136
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,625
You fought a lot, didn't you?
Go bathe.

137
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,541
I am bored after all the stunts!

138
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,375
What happened?
How come there's blood on your shirt?

139
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,541
Huge problem. I was fighting
with 40 people all alone.

140
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,666
I thrashed them all.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,958
Hadn't I been there,
your brother would have died.

142
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,083
You better understand that!

143
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,083
Is the matter resolved?

144
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,875
Yes. We drove them away
and broke the fence.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,958
You get me some hot water.
- Okay.

146
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:03,000
Kannan! Be careful.
Do not go to the market alone.

147
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,750
Let me know if you have any problems.

148
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,833
Okay.
- I'll talk to you later.

149
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,250
Were our men harmed?

150
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:13,166
Nothing happened. We are brave people.
What can happen to us?

151
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,041
We shouldn't have taken Kannan along.

152
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,625
He fainted the moment
he saw blood. - He is a young boy.

153
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,166
When I asked him to fight, he kept
staring as if a show was going on.

154
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,541
I should be blamed for having taken
cowards along with me to fight.

155
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,541
Do not ask questions. Get hot water.
- Why are you shouting at me?

156
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,166
Did I come on my own?
Father is calling.

157
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,125
He has kept cold water ready for me.
I will take bath and come.

158
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,250
My new shirt is dirty.
- Here is your coffee.

159
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,625
My father will ask so many questions now.
- What is this? Blood!

160
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,000
Nothing, leave it.

161
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,958
You stupid!
Fool!

162
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,666
They beat up our people.
Why did you go with them?

163
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,083
I did not go willingly.

164
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,375
I was just standing outside. They took me along.
You understand things very late.

165
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,166
He threatens to kill me
if I refuse to go.

166
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,541
And when I went there, the opponent
threatened to kill me.

167
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,625
Somehow, I have come back alive.

168
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,041
And you are talking like this!

169
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,000
I will send your husband one day.
Wait and watch.

170
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,958
You work for them.

171
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,166
Why shouldn't our son go with them?
- Exactly! - That's unfair.

172
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,583
Mrs. Ramaiah!
Working for them is different

173
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,791
than going along with them
for fights.

174
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,166
If your son gets stabbed
by them, he will die.

175
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,750
He has returned alive.
Keep quiet. You come, dear.

176
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,250
He is irritated in the morning itself.
Did you prepare coffee for him?

177
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,375
Carry on.

178
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,208
No one can save you.

179
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,791
Hey! Come here.

180
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,458
Aren't you the one who plays songs
at the temple early in the morning?

181
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,583
Yes.

182
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,083
You are playing film songs
during this holy month

183
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,041
when you should ideally
be playing devotional songs. Stupid!

184
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,541
You are having egg fritters

185
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,791
but your brain is empty!

186
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:41,958
Where is he?

187
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,041
Inside.
- Move.

188
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,375
You're in trouble.
Go.

189
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,875
I'd asked you to go to Rowther's house.
What are you doing here?

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,166
Have you done any work on time?

191
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,666
I will go, father. You carry on.

192
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,125
You need not go.
Go to the school directly.

193
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,791
Take money from sir

194
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,583
and go to the town in the afternoon
to place the order.

195
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,500
Until then, be there and see if the workers
are doing their work properly.

196
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,500
We have brought workers from another city.
Supervise properly.

197
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,875
Is that fine? - Sir, good morning!
- I will do it.

198
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,375
You are a useless father.
- Greetings! - Greetings!

199
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,875
I wonder how you can drink tea
at a place like this!

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,500
Please go! I wonder how people live
in buildings constructed by you!

201
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,916
Yes, come in.

202
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,041
Hi.
- Hi.

203
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,250
Sit for some time. I'm unable to find
the receipt. Let me look for it first.

204
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,833
"Oh, flower of Germany."
- Where did it go?

205
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,875
"You are the lovely girl of Tamil Nadu."

206
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,000
"Oh, flower of Germany."

207
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,125
"You are the lovely girl of Tamil Nadu."

208
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,291
Hello!

209
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,625
Phone!
- "You are the angel of love."

210
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,375
Tell me, sir.
- What are you doing there?

211
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,041
Come fast, you fool!

212
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,583
The ringtone is really nice.
- Thanks.

213
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,916
I have different ringtones
for different people.

214
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,083
Where could it be?

215
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,916
I'm having severe body ache.

216
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,958
You're just sitting around and watching!
Can't you help?

217
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,625
I am coming.
I was waiting for this.

218
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,708
Hey! What are you doing?
- I am helping.

219
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,833
Take that file from there.

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,875
I was talking about the file.
- Oh, by help, you meant this? - Yeah.

221
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,291
Take it.
- What do you want?

222
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,458
I have to buy cement and stones.

223
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,416
I am leaving for the town.
So, I have come to take money.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,041
You and your father are always keen
on extracting money from us.

225
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,958
It doesn't look like you'll finish
the work anytime soon.

226
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,625
Why are you talking like this, Revathy?

227
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,041
How else should I speak?

228
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,166
Come on, Revathy. Do you know, I'm working
day and night and on Sundays too?

229
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,041
We have brought workers from another city
since we weren't getting workers here.

230
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,291
It's easy for you to question us,
sitting in an air-conditioned room.

231
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,416
But if we say something, you get angry.
I mean.. Listen, Revathy..

232
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,875
You need not say anything.

233
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,291
When will you finish the work?

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,625
How much money do you need now?

235
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,791
I want 2/4, 3/2, in total..
Rs. 45,000.

236
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,916
Your father had asked
for Rs. 40,000 only.

237
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,250
Has he already told you?

238
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,291
Well, Revathy, the price of cement

239
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,125
and stones
keep fluctuating everyday.

240
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,083
My father must not have
included the transportation cost.

241
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,916
I will return the balance, if any.

242
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,500
As if you would!
Listen..

243
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,833
You can cheat your father
and my father

244
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,750
but you cannot cheat me.

245
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,750
I know you quite well since childhood.

246
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,041
When you were in the 10th grade

247
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,791
you said, you were going on a tour
and had borrowed Rs. 500 from me.

248
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,583
You never returned it.

249
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,375
When we were in the 12th grade

250
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,208
you lied and borrowed Rs. 1000 from me.

251
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,500
You never returned that as well.

252
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,000
Wow! You remember everything.
- Yes.

253
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,750
Do you remember,
when we were in the 8th grade

254
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,583
we shared an ice candy that we
bought from a vendor in front of the school?

255
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,375
Keep quiet! Do not change the topic.

256
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,041
Here's the cash.
- Big deal! Even I didn't ask for a check!

257
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,166
I hope the amount is correct.

258
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,458
Of course, it will be.

259
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,500
Also, if you could give me your vehicle keys..
I will return it once I'm back.

260
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,583
Do you need that too?
- Yeah.

261
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,583
Be careful.

262
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,500
It's okay even if you're hurt

263
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,458
but I should get my vehicle back
without any damages.

264
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,791
Revathy, I am going to the town.
Do you need anything? - Where are you going?

265
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,208
Karaikal.
There, you get everything for cheap.

266
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,958
I know what you get for cheap in Karaikal,
you go and come back safely.

267
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,666
Sure, I will.

268
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,083
By the way, you did not answer
my first question.

269
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,375
What did you ask, Revathy?

270
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,916
When will you complete
the construction work?

271
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,250
It can be completed
only if the work goes on smoothly.

272
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,416
You come and see the work.

273
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,250
If I do not complete the work in time,
you can question me.

274
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,916
And question only me.

275
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,958
Will you be there at the site?
- Yes, I'll be there.

276
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,875
Go. I will come.
- Sure, do come.

277
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,458
What are you watching so intensely?
Is it a girl's picture? Come on, play.

278
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,625
Hi, guys!

279
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,791
Why are you late?

280
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:47,958
Why?

281
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,250
It's bound to get late
when two lovers are talking.

282
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,166
Okay, but why are you late?

283
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,750
We were discussing about the future.

284
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,458
I know very well. You will die
after getting thrashed by her.

285
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,041
Shut up! Have you ever spoken
anything good?

286
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,666
He is my true friend.

287
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,250
He is helping me by playing songs
early in the morning.

288
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,250
Shake hands, buddy. - Get lost! Do you know
how many people have scolded me for that?

289
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Calm down.
I will name my first son after you.

290
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,375
Kannan! Don't talk like a fool.

291
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,000
That girl is educated.
She speaks that way with everybody.

292
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,416
Okay, she may talk like that
with everybody.

293
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,958
But will she give her handkerchief to someone
who's sweating, like she gave it to me?

294
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,333
Forget that.
My father had asked for Rs. 40,000

295
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,791
but she gave me an extra Rs. 5000
for my expenses.

296
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,791
Forget that too. She asked me, how I was going
to come here. When I told her, I'll come by bus

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,500
she immediately gave me
the keys to her scooty.

298
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,916
Would she give me all these things
if she wasn't in love with me?

299
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,541
Okay.. Good imagination.
This queen will not suit you at all.

300
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,541
Hey! I can easily win if I have four jokers.

301
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:57,375
He is right. By the by,
you both share a nice chemistry. - Really?

302
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,750
Yeah! - Just because you're playing cards
in the school campus

303
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,291
you think, you're talking
like an educated person.

304
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,083
The omen tells me that there is
going to be a problem.

305
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,500
Don't talk rubbish.

306
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,333
I can't bear
this tea vendor's nuisance anymore.

307
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,583
I'm done.

308
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,541
By talking, I've lost all the money!
- Two triple eights, one joker.. - Look at him!

309
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,958
How did she give you Rs. 5000?

310
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,083
That is love.
Forget all that.

311
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,125
I just saw her like ten minutes ago.

312
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,375
But very soon, she will definitely
come here to see me.

313
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
Will you believe me if she comes?
- Let us see.

314
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,541
If she comes, we will be happy.

315
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,000
If she comes here,
we will break this man's head.

316
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,541
Super idea!
- She's coming. - Come on.

317
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,083
Get lost!
- Revathy is coming.

318
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,625
Kannan, looking by the way
you're progressing

319
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,666
I think, very soon,
you'll start playing rummy with her.

320
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,291
Revathy! See properly. See, how
the construction work is going on.

321
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,791
Move, I want to tell her something.

322
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,916
Ma'am! If your kerchief is dirty,
give it for wash.

323
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,791
Do not give it away to any random person.
- Go away!

324
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,500
Why have they come here?
- Well..

325
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,708
Our friend is constructing the building.

326
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,458
We wanted to be
his pillars of strength.

327
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,583
What is this, Kannan! You'd given
an estimate of 50 bags of cement to my father.

328
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,875
Nothing has been used.

329
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,625
Is the construction work
going on or not?

330
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,166
We do not waste cement
like other contractors.

331
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,625
We use less of cement
and more of sand.

332
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,041
If you do that,
the building won't be strong.

333
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,500
Actually..
- You should have thought about it

334
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,166
before giving the contract
to these people. - Hey!

335
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,083
Keep quiet. - Just wait. I will start checking
everything from today.

336
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,416
Teacher, please stop your lessons.

337
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,958
Look, who is going.

338
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,833
Oh! Is it that girl?
- Yeah.

339
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:27,666
Jil! Jil.. Jil.. Stop there.
- Hey! It's that shop owner!

340
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,875
Come, Revathy.
- Look, how he is running!

341
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,625
Be careful.

342
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why are you here?

343
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,250
Is this what you meant

344
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,333
when you said you were bringing workers
from another city?

345
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,958
Not me, my dad has brought them.

346
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,541
His father is bringing
all the dancers

347
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,875
to enhance the beauty
of the construction!

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,958
Hey!

349
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,250
Oh, my God!
- Jil!

350
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,375
Why is there cement
on your powder coated face?

351
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,833
What to do? These days,
nobody is calling us to dance.

352
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,666
They only call those who dance
for TV shows and in movies.

353
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,625
So, we have lost our jobs
and have come for this work.

354
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,166
Okay, don't worry. You sing a song
for this Kayathur Modu Mutti.

355
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,583
"Hey, gal! There is nobody in the house,
you come in."

356
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,041
"Hey, gal! There is nobody in the house,
you come in."

357
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:32,916
"You help me live my life as I'm the plankton
that can't swim against a current."

358
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:40,500
"You help me live my life as I'm the plankton
that can't swim against a current."

359
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,583
"Oh, no! That is not possible."

360
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,041
"Oh, no! That is not possible."

361
00:20:56,166 --> 00:21:03,166
"Why would oil
like to be with water?"

362
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:11,083
"Why would oil
like to be with water?"

363
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:31,250
"Like Cauvery is for river,
do you epitomize love?"

364
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,291
"Like Cauvery is for river,
do you epitomize love?"

365
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:44,291
"A town should be like Thanjavur,
there is nobody like you here."

366
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:52,208
"A dance like this,
a person like you, a pearl like this."

367
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:56,041
"Do not shy away on seeing me."

368
00:21:56,166 --> 00:22:00,083
"Do not get excited and cling on to me
like a chewing gum."

369
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,416
"Tell me what love is,
else, stand aside quietly."

370
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:10,666
"Why are you going away?
Why are you ditching me?"

371
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,333
"Hey, gal! There is nobody in the house,
you come in."

372
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:26,083
"Hey, gal! There is nobody in the house,
you come in."

373
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:33,000
"You help me live my life as I'm the plankton
that can't swim against a current."

374
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:41,166
"Why would oil
like to be with water?"

375
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:54,041
"'Manorama' for mother
'Paappaiah' for debate.."

376
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,833
"'Manorama' for mother
'Paappaiah' for debate.."

377
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,500
"You are my breath, I need you."

378
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:07,125
"Be mine forever."

379
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:14,708
"A bunch means
a bunch of plantains."

380
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,125
"I will give you a hundred kisses."

381
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,583
"If I ever marry, it will be only you,
otherwise, I will become a sage."

382
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:26,125
"If you break my heart, I'll be shattered.
Do not go away leaving me."

383
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:33,333
"Do not grieve. Where will I go?
When will I become a mother?"

384
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:45,041
"Hey, gal! There is nobody in the house,
you come in."

385
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,541
"Oh, no! That is not possible."

386
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:55,333
"You help me live my life as I'm the plankton
that can't swim against a current."

387
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:03,583
"I am always in love with you."

388
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,666
Hello!

389
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,500
How come you are here, Revathy?

390
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,208
Kannan! Don't you have a brain?

391
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,208
Don't you know
what should be kept where?

392
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,916
What would have happened
if my father had seen it?

393
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:35,041
What? Where did I keep it?
What is happening?

394
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,875
This thing.
- Was it kept here?

395
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,916
I was searching for it all night.

396
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:43,000
Was there anything else
along with this liquor?

397
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:45,916
Will they give this
without any snacks?

398
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,916
Next time, when you ask
for my vehicle, I'll give that too.

399
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,333
I will ask for sure.
- What is that?

400
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,083
Buddy,
you have come with a full bottle!

401
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:58,666
It is her birthday, it seems. So, she has
given me this gift. Let me see it.

402
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,166
Buddy, have both of you
become so close to each other?

403
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,500
You are a true lover boy!

404
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,666
Everyday, you come to my shop
to waste time.

405
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,125
Shouldn't you eat something
from this restaurant

406
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,083
and improve my business?

407
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,541
Let it be.

408
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:17,000
Have you noticed the dog
that used to loiter around here?

409
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:20,333
Yes, all these years,
I never fed it anything.

410
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,083
But today, I gave it a fritter

411
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,791
and it went away wagging its tail,
in gratitude.

412
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:26,291
Why are you asking that?
- That dog is lying dead on the street.

413
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:27,458
Nalla Thambi!

414
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,708
You murderer!

415
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,958
For the last 9 years, that dog used to eat from
different houses and used to guard this town.

416
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,541
You killed it by feeding it
the fritters you had prepared.

417
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,750
You cannot escape from that sin.
- Oh, no!

418
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,416
Go carefully. - Bye.
- I'll leave. - Okay.

419
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,750
Modu Mutti!

420
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,875
I've been noticing.
Everyday, a new person is dropping her.

421
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,208
Could she be an escort?
- Hi!

422
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,625
What a beautiful escort!
Buddy!

423
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:55,458
With very less efforts,
you can woo her. - Okay.

424
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,083
Where are you going?
- To woo her.

425
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,791
She would be of your daughter's age!
You want to woo her, is it?

426
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,208
You will take the lead for everything.
- Comb your hair before going.

427
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,833
Just see, how I woo her.

428
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,875
Hey, girl! He is an accused.
Be careful while talking to him.

429
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:22,375
Hi. Are you going to college?
- Yes.

430
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,666
Which college?
What are you studying?

431
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,458
B.Com.
- What is your name?

432
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,625
Meenakshi.
- 'Meenakshi'.

433
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,375
My name is Nalla Thambi.

434
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,625
9 letters in Meenakshi and 11
in Nalla Thambi. Total, 20 letters.

435
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,458
According to my calculation,
it's a good number.

436
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,250
We are the best couple
in the entire district.

437
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:47,791
Who was the dark person
who dropped you?

438
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,500
My brother.
- Your brother?

439
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,166
Who was the person
who had dropped you yesterday?

440
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,250
He is my brother too.

441
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:58,208
Is it? Who was the person who had dropped
you the day before yesterday?

442
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,291
He is also my brother.
I have 8 brothers.

443
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,375
What do you want now?

444
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,125
From this moment,
you do not have 8 brothers.

445
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:08,041
You have 9, including me.

446
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,916
Hey!
Sacrifice a goat for our deity.

447
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:15,750
Modu Mutti!
- Come, dear. Did it work out?

448
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,416
Tell us.
- Tell us.

449
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,458
What's the matter?
- That girl has 8 brothers.

450
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,041
There are only seven days in a week.
- Yes.

451
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,166
Even if one person hits every day

452
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:30,125
one brother will still be left out.
How would it work out?

453
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,958
Nalla Thambi! Take a parcel
of 8 fritters for her family

454
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,125
and your job will be done.
- You mean, I should kill them?

455
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,750
Stupid! Are you planning
to send me to prison?

456
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,166
It's easy to get contract killers

457
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,916
but very difficult to get laborers
for construction work. It is my fate.

458
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,708
Idiot! It is Friday today.

459
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,000
Have you come
all the way to say that?

460
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,500
Are you joking? Banks are closed
on Saturdays and Sundays.

461
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,875
Didn't I tell you that the check
will be cleared on Monday

462
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,125
only if you deposit it today?

463
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,166
Is it always necessary for me to push
you to do things? - Ramaiah sir!

464
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,750
You have not brought him up properly..
- Keep quiet. - Move aside. - Correct.

465
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,416
Hey, you!
What is your age? And how old are they?

466
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,125
There should be some logic
in being friends with them, right?

467
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,041
I wonder, how your wife respects you!

468
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,208
Ask him to leave.
- Sir!

469
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,041
I will break your hands! - Ask him to leave
before something untoward happens.

470
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,000
I mean it!

471
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,916
Are you mocking me?
- It's nothing as such.

472
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,250
All useless persons
have assembled together.

473
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,958
Which wife respects her husband?

474
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,625
Why are you blaming me alone?

475
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,666
He yelled at you so badly.
Come, let us go to the bank.

476
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,166
He seems to have got you infuriated!

477
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,791
Where are you going?

478
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,541
When did you get down?
- When did I get on the bike?

479
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,875
Come.

480
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,666
Hello! How are you?
- What is this?

481
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:36,583
Why is he coming back?
Oh! It's for this girl!

482
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:37,875
Kannan!
- Revathy!

483
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,875
Where are you going?
- I am going to our school. I am in a hurry.

484
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,458
Even I am going there.
Come.

485
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,666
Me?
- You didn't believe when he said!

486
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,416
Kannan! You 'kappy',
sister 'kappy', I am 'kappy'!

487
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,791
You follow me.

488
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,291
You carry on.

489
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,000
You drive.

490
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,083
Hey!

491
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,833
Are you coming too?

492
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,708
You can hold my waist.
I will not say anything.

493
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:34,666
I am a very decent guy,
you know!

494
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:42,208
Hey! Hey, stop.
- Who is that?

495
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,041
It's me, your father.

496
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,583
I just asked you to go to the bank.
Why did you come here?

497
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:49,375
Well.. Father..

498
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,541
Revathy asked me to come.

499
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:52,833
Did you call him?

500
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,125
Yes, Mr. Ramaiah.
I asked him to come. - What for?

501
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,750
Nothing serious. Yesterday,
the account was not settled. So..

502
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,958
Revathy, do not give him any money.
I will speak to your father about it.

503
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,958
First, come inside.
- Speak to her quickly

504
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,125
and go to the bank.

505
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,500
I know everything.
Do your job.

506
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,083
Let's go, Revathy.

507
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,833
He is insulting me
in front of a girl!

508
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,416
I'm ashamed to call him my son.

509
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,708
You always lie!

510
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,333
Wait! Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

511
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,916
That is not a bathroom.
It is a cupboard.

512
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,375
Oh, yes! It is a cupboard.
I will go to the bathroom.

513
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,583
Hey! What do you think of yourself?

514
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,125
What happened, Revathy?

515
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,083
I felt sorry for you and so,
I asked you to come with me on my bike.

516
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,375
But your friends were teasing us!

517
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,958
They were not teasing us, Revathy.

518
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,958
I know who they were teasing.

519
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,458
Why are you asking if you know it?

520
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,000
Moreover, you held my waist,
when we were coming.

521
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,958
The road was so uneven.
So, for balancing..

522
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:44,291
So? Will you hold my waist?
- It was just for a grip, Revathy.

523
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,875
I am being too lenient with you.

524
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,958
No, you are not.

525
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,208
Forget that. Your father
has asked you to go to the bank.

526
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,750
Then, why did you come with me?

527
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,750
Come on, Revathy!
You always doubt me.

528
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:59,416
I'm not doubting you. I am convinced
that you are going wrong.

529
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,208
Hit him! Rascal! We just asked him to repay
the money he had borrowed from us.

530
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
How dare he go to the police station!

531
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,791
Listen.. Does he think
that we are scared of the police?

532
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,666
Hey! Don't let him go.

533
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,083
I will come and thrash him.
Now, hang up.

534
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,125
How dare he! - Revathy, where are
the car keys? - Revathy, where are the keys?

535
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,916
How come you are here?

536
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,041
I had come to collect money.

537
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,500
Have you collected it?
- Yes, more than it is required.

538
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,958
Okay. Finish the work soon.
- Okay. Sure.

539
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,958
Are they doing the work properly?
- Yes.

540
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,166
Okay, I will leave.
- Okay, uncle.

541
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,125
They have murdered the MLA!

542
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,083
Break the shops!
Set all the shops on fire!

543
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,333
There seems to be a riot.
Cars are not allowed to go that side.

544
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,583
Cars may not be allowed.
I will go on my bike.

545
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,250
Okay, start.
Hurry up. - Perumal..

546
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,541
Go carefully.
Bring the girl home safely.

547
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,125
You didn't listen to me
when I told you not to send her.

548
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,958
Mr. Perumal, where are you going in a hurry?
- I am going to the town.

549
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,208
How can you go? I came back myself
as it's highly impossible to go there.

550
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,083
Why do you want to go there? Revathy's stranded
at the town office. I have to bring her back.

551
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,750
Is that all?
Kannan has gone there.

552
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,041
If I tell him, he will bring her along.
- Okay, call him up.

553
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,125
Give him a call.
- The whole town is in a frenzy.

554
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,583
Are you going to carry the materials
on your head? First, try to reach home safe.

555
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:11,208
You understand my situation,
but my father doesn't.

556
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,375
He will shout at me saying that I'm not
efficient enough to do anything.

557
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,833
You have no idea about him.

558
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:18,125
See, I was talking about him
and he is already calling me up.

559
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,541
What a torture early in the morning! - Dad!
We will not get the bricks and stones today.

560
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:24,041
There is a riot going on here. Do not
torture me by calling up repeatedly.

561
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,666
Hey! Son of a fool!

562
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:26,791
Yes, you're right.
Tell me.

563
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:30,166
Listen, Revathy has come
to the town office.

564
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:33,500
The situation is very tense there.
You go and bring her back safely.

565
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,708
Respond, when I am speaking to you
over the phone.

566
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,416
Call me
as soon as you meet Revathy.

567
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,583
Okay?
Can you hear me?

568
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,500
Did you understand?
Hey, son of a fool!

569
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:09,333
"My heart makes a sound."

570
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:13,291
"My heart makes a sound."

571
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:18,541
"Stop and talk to me, hey, girl."

572
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:22,166
"Stop and talk to me."

573
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,500
"Both my eyelashes are flickering."

574
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:28,041
"I do not know what is happening."

575
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:32,291
"My heart is pounding,
I'm unable to complete my sentence."

576
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,833
"I am not able to sleep."

577
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:41,375
"I cannot bear it
if you go without talking to me."

578
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,833
"You have left me speechless."

579
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,750
"My heart makes a sound."

580
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:03,208
"My heart makes a sound."

581
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:08,833
"Stop and talk to me, hey, girl."

582
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:12,750
"Stop and talk to me."

583
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:45,666
"I do not need a rainbow
if you are there with me."

584
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,958
"You are the moon and the sun."

585
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:54,416
"You are the blooming garden."

586
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:58,291
"You are the stars too."

587
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:03,958
"You are my treasure."

588
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:08,250
"You are the God
who cannot be seen anywhere."

589
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:12,708
"I am attracted towards you."

590
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:17,375
"My heart makes a sound."

591
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,708
"My heart makes a sound."

592
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,583
"Stop and talk to me, hey, girl."

593
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,625
"Stop and talk to me."

594
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,750
"When you walk"

595
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,958
"the earth revolves at the same pace."

596
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:21,333
"It keeps an eye on you."

597
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:25,958
"To help you avoid losing the way"

598
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:30,458
"I will stand still
like a pillar in the temple."

599
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:34,291
"The world ends
where you stop walking."

600
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:39,458
"Even a barren land
will bear flowers because of you."

601
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:43,708
"Do not fight, I am attracted to you."

602
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,916
"My heart makes a sound."

603
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,750
"My heart makes a sound."

604
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,708
"Both my eyelashes are flickering."

605
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,291
"I do not know what is happening."

606
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,458
"My heart is pounding,
I'm unable to complete my sentence."

607
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:06,291
"I am not able to sleep."

608
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:11,666
"I cannot bear it if you go
without talking to me."

609
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:16,208
"You have left me speechless."

610
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:22,083
Kannan! Can you take the cement bags
from Rowther's shop

611
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,208
and deliver it at Karupur Seth's house?
After that, can you go to the lorry office

612
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,333
and check with them
as to when the iron load will arrive?

613
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:30,208
You take care of such petty work,
I have important work to do.

614
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,708
What is that important work?

615
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,708
Stop enquiring about my work.

616
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,750
You don't question your wife
who takes 3 hours to make 'Idlis'.

617
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,625
Instead, you are torturing me.

618
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,875
Hey, Kannan! - Yes, sir.
- Come here. - Coming, sir.

619
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:43,083
He is never ready to do anything
that I ask him to do

620
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,166
but he has no problem running around
doing errands for other people.

621
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:47,791
Go in and bring Kanguvai's documents.
Say that I've asked for it. - Okay.

622
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:50,708
Ma'am!

623
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,916
Ma'am! - My eyes are burning.
- Yeah, coming!

624
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,625
Who is it? Kannan!
What is it?

625
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,291
Sir has asked me to get
Kanguvai's documents.

626
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:05,666
That document!

627
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,791
I do not know where I have kept it.
I'll have to search for it.

628
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,958
Okay, you take a seat.
- Aunt! Where have you gone?

629
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,958
My eyes are burning.
Aunt!

630
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,291
She has taken the mug.
Aunt! What are you doing?

631
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,458
Ma'am!
Ma'am!

632
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,416
Aunt, come soon.
My eyes are burning.

633
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,541
Here I come.

634
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:27,625
This is not a mug.
It is my luck.

635
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:32,041
Oh! Where had you gone?

636
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:36,041
Come soon.
My eyes are burning. Pour water.

637
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,916
Quick!

638
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:44,208
You are just pouring water.
Won't you rinse my hair?

639
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You don't allow me to use shampoo.

640
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,958
The herbal powder
is causing my eyes to burn.

641
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,916
Well, Revathy!
Shampoo is not good for the hair..

642
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,291
Heck! When did you come inside?
Get out. - I came long time back.

643
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,875
I will finish my work in 5 minutes.
- Get out!

644
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,500
Ma'am! - Here are the documents,
you had asked for.

645
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:08,833
Okay, I'll take your leave.
- Where are you going?

646
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,750
Have a seat.
He is always in a hurry.

647
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,791
But you should go only after
having this milk pudding. Sit down.

648
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:16,541
Give me that document.
Have the pudding first.

649
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,291
She is offering it so affectionately.
It must be tasty!

650
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,458
Ma'am! The pudding is tasty.
It is tasty.

651
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,500
No, let it be.
- Your hair is not dry yet.

652
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,416
Enough, aunt.
- You may catch a cold.

653
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,041
I'm telling you, it is dry.
Leave me.

654
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,750
What a girl!

655
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,750
Stupid! Why are you laughing?
Are you mad?

656
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,333
You're coming and rinsing a girl's hair
when she is taking bath!

657
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:51,708
Don't you have a brain?

658
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:55,041
Come on, Revathy! These days you're losing
your temper for the smallest of things.

659
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,666
You have watched me naked

660
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:59,083
while taking bath in the river.
I never felt shy.

661
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,541
You are talking about something

662
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,166
that had happened when we were
in the 4th grade. Get lost! - Good Lord!

663
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,500
However, it was a good feeling!
- Oh, no!

664
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,833
Hey! I have told you guys so many times

665
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,500
not to steal stones from my
future brother-in-law's construction site.

666
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,958
We will be embarrassed
if he finds out.

667
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,416
Kannan! You are repeatedly
saying that he is your brother-in-law..

668
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,041
Can you please tell us,
what do you mean by that?

669
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:24,416
Buddy! Explain everything
whatever happened on the day of the riot.

670
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:30,458
Everyone, listen. We got stranded
because of the riot. On our way back

671
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,333
while crossing the river,
the water level was up to our hips!

672
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,916
She insisted me
to carry her in my arms.

673
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:39,500
Then, we romanced
near the riverside..

674
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:43,416
Buddy! Your clothes
must have got drenched. Right?

675
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:49,208
Yes, buddy! Then, she wore
my shirt and I draped her sari.

676
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:53,458
Horrible!
- It is divine love, you carry on.

677
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,208
Don't speak like that.
I will continue.

678
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,583
Then, while we were going
on the cart

679
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:04,166
she leaned on me,
placing her head here..

680
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,583
Buddy! Then, she must have bitten
the corner of your ears. Right?

681
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,291
Correct, buddy!
Give me a high five.

682
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,166
You are saying it
as if you've witnessed it.

683
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,541
Buddy, even I have fallen in love
when I was in the 5th grade.

684
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:21,041
Why are you looking at me?
Look at him.

685
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,208
Kannan!
- What is it?

686
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,708
She lives in the house opposite to mine.
Every time you come out

687
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:28,750
you have to face them.
You know what sort of people they are.

688
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,208
Listen! If Perumal

689
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,666
kicks you it's going to hurt a lot.

690
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,708
Moreover, his feet are so hard.

691
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,708
How did you happen
to see his feet?

692
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,958
I happened to see it when he smeared
the extra oil in his hands

693
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,791
after eating the fritters at my shop,
on his feet. Listen. - Yuck!

694
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,875
If you are really brave, do this.

695
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,041
What should I do?

696
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:50,708
Address Perumal as 'brother-in-law'.
He should hear it.

697
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,166
Listen to what he's asking you to do.
- If that happens

698
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,708
I'll be the first person
to sacrifice my life for your love.

699
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,791
I mean it.

700
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,500
Not just 'brother-in-law'.

701
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,208
He will address him
anything that you ask him to.

702
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,666
He will definitely accept your challenge.

703
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:02,083
Buddy! Go ahead
and address him that way.

704
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:07,041
Modu Mutti! Mark my words.
- Tell me.

705
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:12,500
I will address Perumal as 'brother-in-law'.
This is my promise.

706
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,791
I'm sure, he will.
- Take your hand off.

707
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:17,291
Have I lit camphor on my head
for you take a vow? You prove it.

708
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,708
What is that?

709
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,625
I am sorry.

710
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:36,791
Throw him away.

711
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:39,625
Sir, you go. We will take care.
You lift his legs. Lift him.

712
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,041
So many people!

713
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,625
Mother..
- What is it?

714
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,875
Why have so many people
gathered at the neighbor's house?

715
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,333
What is the problem?
- There's no problem.

716
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,958
The groom's family members have come
to ask for Revathy's hand in marriage.

717
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,458
Nobody informed me.

718
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,541
Are you related to them?

719
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,875
Why should they tell you?
Even I came to know only now.

720
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:09,958
Go and do your work.

721
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,333
Mother.. - Yeah.
- Mother!

722
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:15,750
What is it?
- Mother, listen to me.

723
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,541
She is our neighbor.

724
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:22,041
She is so close to you.
She could have told you, at least.

725
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,375
Every now and then,
she tortures me

726
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,291
by asking me to get her flowers,
butter and so on.

727
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,083
She could have told me about it.

728
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:34,625
What a family!
They do not know to give respect.

729
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:39,291
Do you think, she will be happy
after marriage? No.

730
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:42,291
Hey! Why are you cursing
that girl early in the morning?

731
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,916
She might be
unaware of the alliance.

732
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,666
How would it matter anyway,
even if we got to know about it?

733
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:53,083
Go. Brush your teeth and take bath.
Go. I wonder what he thinks of himself!

734
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:57,125
Nobody seems
to understand my plight.

735
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,083
Whom do I whine about it?

736
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,916
Why has he come here?
Has he found out the truth?

737
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,916
What is this? Somebody has
come with a marriage proposal.

738
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:16,000
I guessed it. You were so dull for two days.
- No, buddy. - Don't say anything. I get it.

739
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:19,041
That girl must have cried,
hugging you tightly.

740
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:22,166
She must have asked
you to stop the wedding.

741
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,333
You must be at sea,
not knowing what to do.

742
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:28,416
I can understand your feelings very well.

743
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,125
Do not worry.

744
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:36,625
I am there.
We will find a solution for this.

745
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,125
Definitely.

746
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:44,083
I don't worry about anything
when you are with me.

747
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,208
Okay, just listen to me.
- Kannan! Mr. Perumal is asking for you.

748
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:50,125
I'm coming, sir.
- What kind of a rebellious love is this!

749
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,541
Go and prostrate before them.

750
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,125
I've liked the girl a lot.

751
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,666
If you also agree,
let's fix the wedding date.

752
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:20,458
Look at her properly.

753
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:22,875
Later, don't complain
about the girl's looks.

754
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,958
Look at her properly.
- Keep quiet.

755
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,958
They just have to look at the girl once
to know that she is beautiful.

756
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,666
They have come here after enquiring
about the girl. Be quiet.

757
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,125
Dad! They have agreed for the wedding.
Finalize it.

758
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,333
Thank you so much.

759
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,583
If you have any date in mind

760
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:37,875
we can keep the wedding
on that day itself.

761
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Get that calendar.

762
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,916
Here.

763
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,458
The 15th day of the month 'Vaigasi',
a Sunday

764
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,333
is an auspicious day.
We can keep the wedding on that day.

765
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,416
The engagement could be done
on the previous day in the temple.

766
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,541
Do you all agree?
- Okay.

767
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,125
Only 30 days are left for the wedding.

768
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,916
The whole town should gather
and the celebration should be a grand one.

769
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,791
All of you should leave
only after having meals.

770
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,500
It's the bride's brother's request.

771
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,291
Kannan! Hold this bucket.

772
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,958
Let's go and get meat.
Come on.

773
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,000
If we don't hurry up,
we won't get fresh meat.

774
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,958
Are you not well?
Why do you look dull?

775
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:19,125
Not at all.
I am very happy today.

776
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:22,083
My daughter has also grown up
motherless, just like me.

777
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:26,708
I have never scolded her.
She always behaved well.

778
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:31,041
She has never put forth
unreasonable demands.

779
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,833
She should live happily.

780
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:35,291
That is why, I'm getting her married
into a rich family.

781
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:39,125
My daughter is going to live like a queen.
Just like a queen!

782
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,583
I've found a suitable alliance for her.

783
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:49,083
Revathy, are you going to get
your wedding dress tomorrow?

784
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:52,375
Yes, Shanti.
You should also come with me.

785
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,666
Okay. I will come.

786
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:59,166
Shanti! You all carry on.
I will join you soon.

787
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,458
We will wait outside.

788
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,291
I will be right back.
- Come fast.

789
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,833
Kannan!

790
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:16,500
We are going to buy dresses
for everyone tomorrow.

791
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:22,666
50 silk saris.
Loin cloth and shirt for your father.

792
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,875
Silk sari for your mother.

793
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,833
What do you want?

794
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:36,250
Shall I buy it
or will you buy it yourself?

795
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:40,708
If you want me to buy it,
you shouldn't complain later.

796
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:43,958
Otherwise, it's better if you go
and buy it yourself.

797
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:51,791
Take this money.

798
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,583
Revathy, will you marry me?

799
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:04,333
Tell me, Revathy.
Will you marry me?

800
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:08,333
Leave me.
My wedding is already fixed.

801
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,500
You are asking me now!

802
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:14,625
Mad fellow!

803
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:25,208
25..

804
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:33,416
We were classmates till the 12th grade.
I never had any such feelings for her then.

805
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:36,666
One day, she left for another city
for higher education.

806
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,041
She didn't come home
even during the holidays.

807
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:45,583
It was then that I started yearning
to meet her and talk to her.

808
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:49,666
She returned after 4 years
like an angel.

809
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,125
I fell for her.

810
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:54,666
I never expected that they will
fix her wedding somewhere else

811
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:56,791
within four months
of our courtship.

812
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:02,500
I cannot even think
of a life without her.

813
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,958
Calm down.

814
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,791
They have just fixed the wedding.
They are not married yet.

815
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,416
What else is left?

816
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,458
They have fixed the wedding.

817
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,166
The date is also finalized.

818
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:15,125
In spite of that,
you are writing 25

819
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,791
24 on the board
and creating tension!

820
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:21,958
Listen, do not say unnecessary things
and provoke him, you fools!

821
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,875
What do you know about love?

822
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:27,250
As if you know everything!
I'll thrash you!

823
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:32,583
If she loved him, why did she give
her consent to marry another guy?

824
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,666
Hey! You know about her family,
don't you?

825
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,708
How can that girl convince them?

826
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:41,500
I will thrash you and hang you.
You had slept off.

827
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:45,541
I will give you half a glass of milk.
Drink that and go to sleep.

828
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,208
Talking about creating a chaos!

829
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:52,958
Keep quiet!
She will die without me.

830
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,041
Hey! Don't worry.
I will do something.

831
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:58,166
You do whatever you want.

832
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,958
But don't do the planning
sitting in my shop.

833
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:04,750
Somehow I am making money
by selling stale food.

834
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,958
Do not ruin my business.

835
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,458
Hey! Where are we going?
- To Revathy's in-law's place. - And?

836
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,916
Take the case of actor Chandrababu.

837
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,416
When his wife told him
about her lover

838
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:14,791
on their wedding night

839
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:17,291
he immediately took her
to her lover and united them.

840
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:20,291
In Revathy's case, only the marriage is fixed.
Let's talk to them and see.

841
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:26,666
"Do not come from one place
to another and fall in love."

842
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,000
Hey! Make 3 cups of tea.
- 4 cups of tea.

843
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:31,458
We are only three of us.

844
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,041
I need two cups. - Of course!
After all, I'm the one paying for it.

845
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:36,791
"Brother, don't fall in love."

846
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:38,333
Hey! Can't you see, I am reading?

847
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:41,166
Big deal! Even I haven't taken it
for any other purpose!

848
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,875
Here, read it out.

849
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,291
By the way..
What's his name?

850
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:46,625
Mathur Narayanan.

851
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,333
Who is Mathur Narayanan here?

852
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,166
Looks like he has borrowed
money from everybody.

853
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,666
All of them look angry.
- Keep quiet.

854
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,583
Hey! Whom did you ask for?

855
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,250
Narayanan!

856
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,541
Hey!
Give some identification hints.

857
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:03,791
Oh! It is Narayanan. The moment
you see him, you feel like hitting him..

858
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:06,333
Oh! I think, he is deaf.
Come closer.

859
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:11,583
Narayanan..
Who is Mathur Narayanan?

860
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,166
Stop it.

861
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,416
Whom did you ask for?

862
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,166
Despite shouting so much,
he is not able to hear.

863
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,583
Keep quiet!
We are coming from Kayathur.

864
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:21,625
Narayanan's bride-to-be
is from our town.

865
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:24,750
If you could give us the directions
to his house, we will meet him and go.

866
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:27,416
Oh! So, you are from the bride's side!
You should have said so before.

867
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:29,500
Hey! Sit down. - Hey! Sit down.
- Hey!

868
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,750
Don't speak!

869
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:34,541
Don't call out sir's name
with disrespect.

870
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:38,166
If his men came to know of it,
they will kill you. Do you get it?

871
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,958
Go straight.
You will find a huge bungalow.

872
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:44,541
That is sir's house.
Go on.

873
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,500
Where is he?
Has he left?

874
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:51,333
Get lost! You told me that he can fight
with 10 people all alone. He has escaped.

875
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,125
I said, he will get scared
if 10 people came to fight.

876
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,500
You misunderstood it, what can I do?
- Fool! Okay, let us go.

877
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,041
Where to?
- To the groom's house.

878
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:01,333
Go there and do what?
- Stop Revathy's marriage.

879
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,666
The wedding will not stop.
We will stop breathing.

880
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:06,791
No matter what happens,
my love is important to me.

881
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,416
My life is important to me.

882
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:11,458
Hey! - My friend is also important.
Come on.

883
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,750
Kannan! You seem to be behaving
differently since last two days.

884
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:25,208
What's wrong?

885
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,166
What do you mean? Am I behaving
like a mad person? Do you think I am mad?

886
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,166
Why are you talking like that?

887
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:36,583
You look tired.
So, I thought, you must be unwell.

888
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,541
I am alright.

889
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:40,583
I just don't feel like staying
in this place.

890
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:43,791
Then ask him if he is ready to go abroad.
I'll make the arrangements.

891
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,750
You both are bent upon
sending me away from here.

892
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,458
Why are you saying like that?

893
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,708
Since you said that you didn't
feel like staying here

894
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,291
your father gave that suggestion.

895
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,000
Leave it.

896
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:57,750
The site engineer told your dad
that there is something going on

897
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,875
between you and Revathy.
- It's a lie, isn't it?

898
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:07,041
When you yourself are saying
that it is a lie, how can it be true?

899
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:12,125
We work for them. How can we ask
for their daughter's hand in marriage?

900
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:14,500
Okay, leave it.

901
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,708
There are so many girls in this town.

902
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:20,791
Only whatever is destined will happen.
You eat.

903
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:23,875
Hey! Your friends are stupid.

904
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,958
Do not listen to them and do
something drastic. I will kill you.

905
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:12,916
Why are you sitting here alone?

906
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,041
You have left me all alone.

907
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:19,958
There you go again!
I told you already.

908
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,666
Why are you bringing it up
again and again like a kid?

909
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,583
What? Like a kid?

910
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,625
I am confessing my love
to you so seriously

911
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,916
and you are calling me a kid!

912
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:35,958
What do you think of me?
- What do you want me to think?

913
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:38,375
What else can a girl think,
who is already engaged to somebody else

914
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,916
say, if you ask her to marry you?

915
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,708
Actually, Revathy..
That person, his face, mustache..

916
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:47,625
You are saying that you will marry him!

917
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,333
You are not even considering me.
What do you know about him?

918
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:52,958
Whether he is good or bad

919
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,625
whether he will take good care
of you or not..

920
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,958
You do not know anything.
But you know everything about me.

921
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,916
Just answer one question, Revathy.

922
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,541
Apart from being wealthy,
how is he better than me?

923
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:11,250
Revathy, one minute, please.
Understand my plight.

924
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:15,208
You reside in my heart.
You are my life.

925
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:17,666
You have a heart too.

926
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:21,125
Your heart will tell you,
whom you will be happy with.

927
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:23,250
Give it a thought, Revathy.

928
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,666
No matter how much I tell you,
you don't seem to understand.

929
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,041
Go away.

930
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:37,291
"Go, go, go.
Go wherever you want to go."

931
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:43,708
"Go, go, go,
I do not need you."

932
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:59,041
"I am not at all worried,
go, my dear, go."

933
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:04,916
"Marry whomever you want to,
I've no qualms, go."

934
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:09,916
"Go, go, go.
Go wherever you want to go."

935
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:15,833
"Go, go, go,
I do not need you."

936
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:21,041
"You are going to live like a queen,
every time you take birth."

937
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:26,500
"There is nobody like me.
You will say that for sure."

938
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:31,458
"Like a parrot, you flew away."

939
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:36,958
"Without telling me,
you have left me in the lurch."

940
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:42,125
"Go, go, go.
Go wherever you want to go."

941
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:47,833
"Go, go, go,
I do not need you."

942
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:19,833
"My dear, what am I lacking in?
Please say."

943
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:25,416
"My eyes are dry."

944
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:35,333
"We played on the swing
during our childhood."

945
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:40,541
"We spent time together
during our teenage."

946
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:45,833
"We have had so much fun together."

947
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:50,958
"We scolded those
who saw us as two different individuals."

948
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:54,208
"My love!"

949
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:59,583
"Go, go, go.
Go wherever you want to go."

950
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:04,833
"Go, go, go.
Go away from my life."

951
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:39,666
"I got no wounds
even after getting hit by stones."

952
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:45,208
"Now, I am wounded, justify that."

953
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:50,041
"I guarded love to be with you."

954
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:55,166
"I will die if you leave me and go."

955
00:58:55,291 --> 00:59:00,416
"There's no peace of mind
in living without you."

956
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:05,541
"It is your fate
if you do not accept me."

957
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:12,958
"It's your fate."
- Kannan!

958
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:16,083
Hey!
Why are you behaving like this?

959
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:29,333
"I am not at all worried,
go, my dear, go."

960
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:34,958
"Marry whomever you want to,
I've no qualms, go."

961
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:40,291
"Go, go, go.
Get married and go."

962
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:45,666
"Go, go,
I am a useless person."

963
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:51,166
"You are going to live like a queen,
every time you take birth."

964
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:56,666
"There is nobody like me.
You will say that for sure."

965
00:59:56,791 --> 01:00:01,583
"Like a parrot, you flew away."

966
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:07,833
"Without telling me,
you have left me in the lurch."

967
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:12,708
"Go, go, go.."

968
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,750
I knew this would happen, when I'd started
the car without performing veneration.

969
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,625
Why is he lying before our car?
- Get up.

970
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,041
Maybe he is fulfilling a vow.
We need to ask him alone.

971
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,416
Kannan!

972
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:21,791
What has happened to him?

973
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,000
We have come from Bombay to see him

974
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:27,416
but he has come and fallen
before our car.

975
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:31,583
Had he not applied the brake on time,
he would have died on the spot.

976
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:36,208
What's wrong with you? What made you
fall before the car, completely drunk?

977
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:39,291
Tell us.
- It's nothing. Forget it.

978
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:42,916
What should we forget?
Boss, I'll tell you what happened. - Okay.

979
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:46,583
Revathy and Kannan
are deeply in love with each other.

980
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:51,166
Yes, boss.
What can a girl do for her lover?

981
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,458
If you take her to a room,
she will agree.

982
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:56,125
That happens at your place.
This is our village.

983
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:59,875
It's true love.
She gifted him a liquor bottle

984
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:03,750
on his birthday.
That made him really happy.

985
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,791
She gives him money for his expenses.

986
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:07,833
Even I've been in love,
but my girl never gave me money.

987
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:11,291
Do you call that love?
That is not love.

988
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:14,541
She gave him her kerchief
as he was sweating.

989
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:17,166
No..
- Keep quiet, do not talk.

990
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:20,875
Only if you tell all this will they get to know
how deeply you're in love with each other.

991
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:25,291
Even he has loved her so much.

992
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:26,833
One day, there was a strike.

993
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,583
There were no buses.

994
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,375
She was stranded.

995
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:37,291
When he knew about it, he ran
to her rescue and lifted her in his arms.

996
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:40,583
Am I narrating a story?
I will hit you.

997
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,375
I am describing their love.
- Okay.

998
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,916
He lifted her in his arms
and pampered her.

999
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:50,416
No, I did not do..
- Wait.

1000
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:53,750
Don't speak.
How will they get to know otherwise?

1001
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,041
He brought her back home safe.

1002
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:59,125
Boss! Even I have read
about so many great lovers.

1003
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,583
Laila-Majnu, Ambikapathy-Amaravathi..

1004
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:04,166
I've read so many stories.
- Even their love is pure. It's nothing as such.

1005
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,666
Allow him to speak.
- Did you see that?

1006
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,208
That's how he is.

1007
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:09,291
He doesn't allow me to speak.

1008
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,000
So pure is their love!

1009
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:14,708
Does their love deserve such an ending?
Does their love deserve such an ending?

1010
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:17,750
This love should win.

1011
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,250
You villagers! You don't seem
to have progressed at all!

1012
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:22,125
Do you know the latest trend?

1013
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,500
It has become common to love a girl

1014
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:27,083
marry her and then, divorce her.
- Hey!

1015
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,666
Hey! Only two days are left.
Don't talk like a fool.

1016
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,041
Don't say 'Only two days are left'.

1017
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:34,750
Say that we have 48 hours in hand.
We can achieve so much within that time.

1018
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:37,833
What do you say, buddy? - Buddy, we will
deal with this matter in Bombay style!

1019
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,875
Kannan! We will manage the elders.
You talk to her

1020
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:42,250
and come back with a good decision.
- Give me a high five.

1021
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,125
Correct. - Superb idea! Come on.
- Okay.

1022
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,875
Ma'am, how are you?
Bless us. - God bless you.

1023
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,458
Why are you going this way?
Come that way. - Actually..

1024
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:52,958
Who are you?
I don't recognize you.

1025
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,083
We are from Bombay.

1026
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:57,166
Is it so? How are you?
- Be careful.

1027
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:59,500
What is happening?
- Everything is over. Go.

1028
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,916
This is how we go round the temple.

1029
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,791
Times have changed now. Now, they have
changed the procedure. - Who said so?

1030
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:05,500
You are fooling me. I won't agree.
I won't come with you.

1031
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,250
Kannan!

1032
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,208
Revathy, I do not know what else to do.

1033
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,333
Somebody might see.

1034
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:15,916
Please Revathy,
please accept my proposal.

1035
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:19,625
Oh, Kannan! Please get up.
I request you. - Please, Revathy!

1036
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:23,000
Please, Kannan!

1037
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:28,958
Come on, boys.

1038
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:33,083
Even I fall at your feet.
Please go away from here.

1039
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:35,000
Why has she fallen at his feet?

1040
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:40,333
I told you. Do you believe me now?
They are deeply in love.

1041
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,833
What is she saying?

1042
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:45,833
I beg of you.
Do not create any problems.

1043
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,416
I will tell you.

1044
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:55,166
'I beg of you. Take me away from here
and marry me.'

1045
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,750
Saying so,
she is pleading with him.

1046
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:03,500
Everyone has gathered for the wedding.
My relatives and all my near and dear ones.

1047
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:06,125
If they get to know
that you are talking like this

1048
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:07,750
they will kill you.

1049
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,541
Kannan! You are a very good person.
I do not have any feelings for you.

1050
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,541
What is she saying now?

1051
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,125
'Let's go away from this village.'

1052
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:20,708
'Even if all my relatives stop me'

1053
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,333
'I don't care.
You're important to me.'

1054
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,416
'I cannot live without you.'

1055
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:28,083
Just give your consent.
We can elope.

1056
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,666
What kind of a man are you?
You are talking like a crazy fellow.

1057
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:33,291
Find a nice girl and marry her.

1058
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:34,583
Everything will fall in place.

1059
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,416
I will say now.

1060
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:39,958
'If this marriage happens,
you will not see me alive.'

1061
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,541
How are you saying that?

1062
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:43,416
It is a feeling.

1063
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:44,708
What a love!

1064
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:49,250
Bombay boys! Did you see that?
Help. Help them.

1065
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:50,750
There he is.

1066
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,416
Buddy, we have decided.

1067
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:56,458
No, she is saying..
- You do not say anything.

1068
01:04:57,166 --> 01:05:00,958
We don't wish to see two lovers dying.
Come on, guys!

1069
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,791
The temple is providing free meals at 1 o'clock.
How about having it before leaving?

1070
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,291
Hit him.
He's always thinking about food!

1071
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:07,083
The Bombay boys
will take care of everything.

1072
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,000
Yes. The central and the state ministers
are coming for the wedding.

1073
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,625
The whole town should be decorated.

1074
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,416
Cutouts should be placed
everywhere.

1075
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,333
Don't drink and waste time.

1076
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:21,625
"My heart is fluttering
like a kite without seeing you."

1077
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,666
What a world this is!

1078
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:29,750
I have to struggle so hard
to live with the girl of my choice.

1079
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:39,041
You love me so much, but you
are ready to marry another person.

1080
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,416
Are you in your senses?

1081
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:48,458
The men in your house are all fools!

1082
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:51,791
They educated you
since they were uneducated.

1083
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
Despite that, you are a fool too, Revathy!

1084
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:59,041
Do you know?
I wake up every day

1085
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,250
only in the excitement
to see you.

1086
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,333
You will marry somebody and go off.

1087
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:08,291
Without you, the house
won't be the same anymore.

1088
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:10,750
It would be equivalent
to a deserted forest.

1089
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:15,791
How am I going to live
without seeing you?

1090
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:27,125
Kannan, calm down!
This phase will also pass.

1091
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,291
Let us see what happens tomorrow.

1092
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:35,125
Kannan! - Look at the location he has chosen
to drink liquor. So poetic! - Yeah.

1093
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,541
Be careful.
- Oh, no!

1094
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,291
Where he cannot finish one peg of liquor

1095
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,875
he has drunk a full bottle.

1096
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:44,916
He won't be able to wake up for two days
now. - He had this liquor! - Lift him. Careful.

1097
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:49,125
Bring him carefully.
- Slowly.

1098
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,708
I'll open the door.
- Open it quickly.

1099
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:53,833
Make him lie down.
- Slowly.

1100
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,500
At least, the car is big.

1101
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,916
Get in, hurry up.
- Be careful about his head.

1102
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:01,041
Get him in.
- Push him. Push him inside.

1103
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,541
Buddy!
Looks like he is serious about her.

1104
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:06,333
We have to do something.
What shall we do?

1105
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:09,458
The engagement is taking place
at the temple. You start the car.

1106
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:10,916
Let's plan it out in the car.

1107
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,208
Whatever we plan to do, let's ensure that
the rest of them don't get to know about it.

1108
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,791
Yes, they will spoil the plan
if they get to know about it.

1109
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:17,291
Hop on.

1110
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,375
Hey! Get into the car.
- Say like that.

1111
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:21,750
Fool! - I am too tense
to understand anything.

1112
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,333
Boss, somebody was climbing
on top of the car. - That was me.

1113
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,833
Boss, thrash him.

1114
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:43,875
Buddy, you speak to Revathy
and make sure, you bring her alone.

1115
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,541
We will ask her one last time.

1116
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,166
Did you see the crowd?

1117
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:50,208
The wedding is tomorrow.
What will she say if you ask her today?

1118
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,375
She will say that tomorrow
is the wedding.

1119
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:55,291
Are you joking? She will say
that she is really scared.

1120
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:00,750
Nalla Thambi! Whatever you
have spoken till now is different.

1121
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:02,875
What we are about to speak
to her now is something else.

1122
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:07,041
It is Bombay technique.
You won't understand. Go and bring her.

1123
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,458
Just watch the way we handle this,
from a distance. Go and get her.

1124
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,416
Very good!
- Very good.

1125
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:15,208
Will they fall at her feet
and request her?

1126
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:21,125
If this marriage happens,
my shop will be safe.

1127
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:28,000
Where were you? There are two bottles
of liquor. We can party tonight.

1128
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:30,666
Moreover, I have befriended
three people from the groom's family.

1129
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,875
Let's extract the maximum
from them in today's card game.

1130
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,958
I'm going to win
a year's income today.

1131
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:39,541
Buddy! They have prepared 18
types of dishes. Each one is so tasty.

1132
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,291
My mouth is watering.

1133
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,625
The 19th dish is rat poison
it seems.

1134
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:46,041
Eat that and die.
You are talking without any conscience.

1135
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:47,916
Kannan is suffering so much.

1136
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,250
What do you want us to do?

1137
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:53,291
Somehow, bring Revathy.
He wants to talk to her.

1138
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,250
I'm not with you.
Leave me alone.

1139
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:58,041
Hey, Modu!
Listen.

1140
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:00,500
Last night itself, Kannan decided
to leave Revathy.

1141
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:04,500
But he wants to give her one last gift.
Do something.

1142
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:08,208
Has Kannan changed his mind?
- Yes. - I am very happy to hear this.

1143
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:11,458
I will bring her because you are my friends.
- Okay.

1144
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,291
Whether Kannan gives her a gift
or kisses her..

1145
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,958
Ask him to put an end
to this matter today. - Okay.

1146
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,916
Look! I am jumping
from a risky place for your sake.

1147
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,583
Go, bald head.
- Go, get her fast.

1148
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,375
Look there, somebody is ogling at you.
- Who is it?

1149
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:32,000
Revathy..
Kannan wants to give you a gift.

1150
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,541
He is standing outside the temple.
Just meet him and come back.

1151
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:35,708
Now?
They will not allow me.

1152
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:38,833
Just say, you are going to get your pictures
clicked. They will believe you. Go.

1153
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:40,041
Go.

1154
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:43,458
Was it a love marriage
or an arranged marriage for you all?

1155
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:47,000
Love marriage.
- Wow! Dear, stay away from them.

1156
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:48,958
Okay, uncle.
- Good girl. You should be like that.

1157
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,625
Come, let us go.

1158
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,375
Why are you all coming?

1159
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,500
We are accompanying the bride.

1160
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,291
But that place
is full of drunkards and rascals.

1161
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:58,166
How can I alone protect you all?

1162
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:00,041
You all stay here.
We will go and be right back.

1163
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,166
Come.

1164
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,541
Who are you?

1165
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,666
We are from the groom's family.
We will come with the bride.

1166
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:09,166
Are you more responsible
than the bride's side?

1167
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,750
There are so many people outside the temple
who are calling us. Do you know that?

1168
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,666
Why are you shouting for that,
bald head? Take her and go.

1169
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:15,875
Matter clear.
Come, let's go.

1170
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:17,750
How many checkpoints to cross!

1171
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,291
Welcome!
- Please come!

1172
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:23,291
There they are. - We are Kannan's friends.
We have come from Bombay.

1173
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,958
Good boys. Good boys.
- Where is Kannan?

1174
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,708
He is inside.
- Welcome to Innova car. Come in.

1175
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,458
Go, he will give you a gift.
Go and take it.

1176
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:35,458
Just smell this kerchief
before getting in.

1177
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:37,666
Why?
- It is scented.

1178
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,875
Hey! Listen to me.
- Get her in. Hurry up.

1179
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:44,625
What is going on here?

1180
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,958
Don't you want Kannan
and Revathy to get married?

1181
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:49,000
Yes, but what are you
going to do to that girl?

1182
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:51,541
This is Bombay technique.
You will not understand. Get in the car.

1183
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:53,375
Hey! Hey.
- What are you doing?

1184
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,416
Do not shout.
You also come. We will go.

1185
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:57,958
I will lose business at the restaurant.
- If you stay back, you'll lose your life.

1186
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,583
Come fast.
- I'm leaving.

1187
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,500
Nalla Thambi! Do not go.
If you go, you will be in trouble.

1188
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,083
We will be in trouble
if we stay here.

1189
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,375
He is talking like a fool.
Tell him.

1190
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,500
He is not a fool. They are leaving
after landing us in trouble. We are fools.

1191
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:09,083
Hey! Where are they taking Revathy?

1192
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,833
I am telling you.
You have not seen anything.

1193
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:14,583
I have also not seen anything.
Remember that.

1194
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:18,291
Sir!
Where have you sent Ms. Revathy?

1195
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:21,875
Oh, my God!

1196
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:24,250
"To fulfill your duties.."

1197
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:30,791
"You have fallen in a trap
while fulfilling your duties."

1198
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:35,750
"Karna, Kannan is the culprit."

1199
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:41,875
"Karna, Kannan is the culprit."

1200
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:50,458
Yes, yes, hang up.
The wedding has been called off.

1201
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,208
I will talk to you later.
Hang up.

1202
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:55,333
Ramaiah! Come out.
I will hack you to death!

1203
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,166
You put sir's family to shame.
I will kill you.

1204
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:01,375
Innova car, metal grey color..
Yes. - Drop the knife.

1205
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:04,791
I do not know the number.
Send the information at all checkpoints.

1206
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,500
Check all the Innova cars.
Inform me immediately. Yes.

1207
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,041
Is that fine?

1208
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:16,333
Where have they gone?

1209
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,958
Honestly, sir.
We don't know anything.

1210
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:24,541
Tell, tell the truth!

1211
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:26,625
You are beating continuously
without allowing me to talk.

1212
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,958
I will kill you! - He is asking you something.
Answer him.

1213
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:32,250
We told you that we don't know anything.
Why are you hitting us?

1214
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:34,583
Buddy, you should not talk so rudely.

1215
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,791
How dare you speak so arrogantly!
- Stop it.

1216
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:38,083
Leave me.
- You are hitting them so softly.

1217
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:40,416
Hit them harder.
- Speak up!

1218
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:44,500
Patience!
Wait and watch, how I hit.

1219
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,541
Where is she? Speak up.

1220
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:52,708
Speak up.

1221
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,958
Hey! Tell the truth.

1222
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:02,208
You may hit us or kick us,
but honestly, we don't know anything.

1223
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:03,458
Don't lie.
- Listen..

1224
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,166
You can beat us whenever you want,
but for now, your wife is calling you.

1225
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:06,750
Ask her what she wants to say.
- What is it?

1226
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,541
Last night, this person spoke
to Revathy and took her along.

1227
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:11,416
Even you are saying that!

1228
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:15,500
Kannan wanted to give her a gift
and so, he asked me to bring her.

1229
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,833
But we did not know that he will
land us all in trouble.

1230
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:20,458
We really do not know anything.

1231
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:23,083
No, Revathy had said that she was
going to get her pictures clicked.

1232
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:25,000
This person is lying.

1233
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:28,083
Oh, no! Witnesses
are testifying strongly against us.

1234
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:29,625
Get up!
What is that?

1235
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:34,125
I thought, telling the real reason might put
us in trouble and so, I asked her to say this.

1236
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,250
The way you're hitting us,
I think, I will die tomorrow itself.

1237
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:38,541
Since how many days
have you been planning this?

1238
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:40,625
You've written numbers
in your tea shop. What is that?

1239
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,416
Kannan had written that.

1240
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:45,333
I ignored that at first, thinking
that it doesn't signify anything.

1241
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:48,708
We did not know, he was counting
the number of days for the wedding.

1242
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:53,791
Weren't you the one who used to play
songs in the temple to support him?

1243
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,375
I thought, it was a devotional song.

1244
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,125
But I played the wrong CD by mistake.
- Is it so?

1245
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,333
Wait.

1246
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:00,375
Wait, sir.
- I will kill you.

1247
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,041
All of them are involved
in kidnapping Revathy.

1248
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,208
If we ask them in this manner,
they will not reveal the truth.

1249
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,125
We will take them to the station

1250
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,875
file an FIR

1251
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,416
put them behind bars
and then, torture them in such a way

1252
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:13,750
that they will reveal the truth.

1253
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:14,916
What complaint will you file against them?

1254
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,958
Kidnapping case. - Good.
- Kidnapping case!

1255
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,375
That girl was in love with Kannan.

1256
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:21,833
She went on her own. Otherwise,
is it possible to kidnap sir's daughter?

1257
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,291
Hey, Modu! What are you looking at?
Say something. - You were simply watching

1258
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:25,750
when they were beating me up.
I will kill you.

1259
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,208
What did you say?

1260
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:32,250
Hey, useless people! Our girl won't do
anything wrong. May you all die a painful death!

1261
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,916
I will hit you.

1262
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:39,208
Hey! What sort of a son he is!
He has brought shame to our family.

1263
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,458
I'm going to kill him!

1264
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:43,833
Leave him. Leave him.
- I won't spare him!

1265
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:45,166
Let him do whatever he wants to do.
- Leave me!

1266
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:47,833
Let him kill us both for our son's mistake.
- I'm telling you! I'll kill him!

1267
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,583
I've severed all ties with my son.

1268
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:55,166
Hey! I will not spare you!

1269
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:12,166
"Like a fire which burns
brighter while fading out.."

1270
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,958
"Like the flowers
on the roadside.."

1271
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:18,250
I can hear music, am I right?

1272
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:24,666
"What a change this is,
it's God's wish."

1273
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,958
Modu! Do you have a kerchief?

1274
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:29,708
Why?
- The MLA's daughter has come.

1275
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:31,250
We were classmates.

1276
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:34,166
I will look better if I wipe
the blood off my face.

1277
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,000
Hey! Will you not do anything
in a simple manner?

1278
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:38,666
You can ogle at girls

1279
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,291
from poor or middle class families

1280
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:42,166
but you're straightaway
ogling at the MLA's daughter!

1281
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:43,875
Befriending the boys of this generation

1282
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,541
has landed me in big trouble!

1283
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,750
Are you laughing? Laugh.

1284
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,541
He laughed and brought
us to this state.

1285
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:49,791
I wonder what you are going to do.

1286
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:52,333
I would have been playing
cards at this time.

1287
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,625
He is bleeding and yet, he is ogling.
I wonder, how he does that!

1288
01:15:56,875 --> 01:16:01,208
Irrespective of wherever your daughter is

1289
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I will get her back
by tomorrow morning.

1290
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,541
My daughter would not
have committed any mistake.

1291
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:13,583
These people have a hand
in her kidnapping.

1292
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:20,000
I have brought up
my daughter well.

1293
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:23,125
Hey! The people of Kayathur
have deceived us.

1294
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,208
Yes. - The person who has kidnapped
the girl whom I was about to marry

1295
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,958
should not be allowed
to stay alive.

1296
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,000
We should not spare him alive!
Come on.

1297
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,208
She's gone.

1298
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:38,250
You were pampering her so much.
See what has happened now!

1299
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,791
She eloped, bringing shame
to the family.

1300
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,083
Whenever I said anything

1301
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:46,208
you silenced me by saying, she is motherless.
See what has happened now!

1302
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:49,625
Do not talk about her.
My brother is already worried.

1303
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,208
Hey!
- You are talking so much!

1304
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:52,458
Go inside!

1305
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:53,916
The guy who abducted her

1306
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:56,458
hack him to death!

1307
01:16:56,583 --> 01:17:00,625
My brother had utmost trust
in you, you broke it!

1308
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:08,708
I don't think, they will return
without killing our son.

1309
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,291
Why are you sitting quietly?

1310
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:13,333
Let's fall at their feet
and request them not to kill our son.

1311
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:16,375
Hey! Why are you asking
me to fall at their feet?

1312
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:19,125
If I get your son,
I will kill him myself.

1313
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:20,833
Scoundrel!

1314
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,125
Listen!

1315
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,125
Hey! Isn't that a shared auto?

1316
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,750
No, it is a lorry.

1317
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,208
I'm unable to make out anything
as I'm feeling sleepy.

1318
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,583
Pull over the car.

1319
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:36,833
Let's proceed
after washing our face.

1320
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:37,958
Okay.
You wake them up.

1321
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:40,250
Buddy!
Nalla Thambi!

1322
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:43,125
Where are we now?
- In Puzhal jail!

1323
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,041
We are in a safe place.
Do not get scared.

1324
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,583
Look, he must not have slept
so peacefully even on his mom's lap!

1325
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,333
We are struggling so much
to unite two lovers.

1326
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,666
I need to urinate.
You get him out.

1327
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,250
Nalla Thambi!
Wake him up.

1328
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:02,750
He is heavily drunk.
Wake him up. - Kannan!

1329
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,416
Kannan! Falling in love isn't enough

1330
01:18:04,541 --> 01:18:06,000
you should also be strong like us.

1331
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,708
Go and wake that girl up.
- Yes, go and wake her up.

1332
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,041
I wonder what will happen now.
- Wake up!

1333
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,750
Revathy! Revathy!

1334
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,125
I wonder, what they made her sniff.

1335
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,416
Revathy! Revathy!
- Wake her up.

1336
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:23,625
Look there, it is Kannan.
Rascal! Look at the way he is sitting.

1337
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:26,333
What are you looking at?
We have come very far.

1338
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:29,000
Nobody can catch you both now.

1339
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:31,833
And nobody can separate you both as well.
- Shut up, idiot! Hey, village boy!

1340
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,708
We brought her here with great difficulty
and you are trying to become a hero!

1341
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:37,708
Keep quiet.
Put your right foot forward and come.

1342
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,541
Put your right foot forward and come.

1343
01:18:39,666 --> 01:18:41,750
Why did you do like this?

1344
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:43,000
This is embarrassing!

1345
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,791
Why did you kidnap me?

1346
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:47,166
Sinners! Why did you do this?

1347
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:50,916
Wake up!

1348
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:54,000
Open your eyes! Look, who has come!
- Look, who has come!

1349
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:57,666
Your darling, your love..
- It's Revathy!

1350
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,791
Look at her.

1351
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,000
Did you deserve this?
Look at her. - Darn it!

1352
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,166
Revathy!

1353
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:09,625
I knew that somehow,
you will kidnap and bring me here.

1354
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,000
Who has kidnapped whom?
I am very much confused.

1355
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:13,333
Love means confusion.

1356
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:14,958
Oh, my God!

1357
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:19,000
Sinners! The auspicious time
must have got over.

1358
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,791
My family's prestige is tarnished!

1359
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:25,875
Why did you kidnap me?

1360
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,666
Have they kidnapped you?

1361
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:29,958
Who kidnapped you, Revathy?

1362
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:33,583
These people who are pretending as if
they don't know anything, kidnapped me.

1363
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,500
Yeah.
- Are you my friends?

1364
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,166
Why did you kidnap her?

1365
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:41,375
Hey! What is happening here?

1366
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,000
He is asking
as if he does not know anything.

1367
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,625
Even I am unable to understand,
what he is saying.

1368
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,625
Could we have kidnapped the wrong girl?
Is she that girl's sister?

1369
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,666
It's nothing as such.
Hey!

1370
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:53,166
We sacrificed our lives
and put in so much efforts

1371
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:56,458
to kidnap this girl for you.
Now, why are you asking like this?

1372
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,208
Hey, girl!
That day in the temple

1373
01:19:58,333 --> 01:19:59,625
you had said, you would die without him.
Now, what has happened to you?

1374
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:03,083
When did I say that I will die?
But now, I feel like dying.

1375
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:09,666
Revathy! You are blabbering in fear.
I know, how much you two love each other.

1376
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,875
Revathy! That day,
you bought him a shirt

1377
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:13,583
gave him money for his expenses

1378
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:15,625
gave him your kerchief
to wipe the sweat off his face

1379
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:19,958
and gave him a bottle of liquor
on his birthday. Is this not love?

1380
01:20:20,291 --> 01:20:21,625
Forget all that.
That day, in the temple

1381
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:28,041
you fell at his feet and pleaded with him
to marry you. Isn't it love?

1382
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:31,041
Oh, my God!
- What have you told them?

1383
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:35,250
Well..
The way I wanted us to be..

1384
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:40,083
I just exaggerated it a bit
and told them.

1385
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:44,041
You exaggerated it?
How much?

1386
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:45,333
Very little.

1387
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:46,708
Hey! Tell me now.

1388
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:49,041
Was she in love with you or not?

1389
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:54,958
She does love me.
But she is not expressing it.

1390
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,958
I do not have
any feelings for you.

1391
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:02,208
I kept refusing your proposal
till the end. What have you done!

1392
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:04,208
Oh, no!

1393
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:06,666
Buddy! We have slightly messed it up.

1394
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:09,333
Not slightly, but totally.

1395
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:11,500
Forget whatever has happened.

1396
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:13,250
Just say, in which temple,
would you like to get married?

1397
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:14,708
Crazy people!

1398
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,000
You should have got this slap.

1399
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:18,208
Revathy!
Wait, Revathy.

1400
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,333
Why are they walking so fast?

1401
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:20,875
Are they going to fix the marriage date?

1402
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
They are going to fix a date
for your funeral. Let them go.

1403
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:28,125
She is in a fit of rage.
If she files a complaint with the police

1404
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,958
all of us will be put behind bars
for kidnapping her.

1405
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:33,583
Kidnapping?
- Yes, I am scared.

1406
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:37,083
Let's try to explain to Revathy.

1407
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,958
Where is he?
- Das!

1408
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:45,000
Oh, no!
I do not know what to do.

1409
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:46,333
Das has escaped in the car.

1410
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:48,250
Who? Our Das?

1411
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,708
Come, let us also flee.
- Whereto?

1412
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:52,583
Anywhere.

1413
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,250
Bombay friends are not trustworthy.

1414
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,250
Only Tamil Nadu friends
stay till the end

1415
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,125
and unite the lovers, even if
it's at the cost of their lives.

1416
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,375
Kannan and Revathy should unite.

1417
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:04,958
I will not rest till they are united.
Do not spit. - Come.

1418
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,916
Revathy! Revathy! Revathy!
Wait, please.

1419
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,250
Where are you going?

1420
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,791
You can talk
only if you drop a coin in that.

1421
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:15,000
You know it, right?
Give me the money.

1422
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,791
Here.

1423
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:21,500
Tell your dad that you've
come on a tour. Please.

1424
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:23,708
There is nobody to pick up the phone!

1425
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:27,000
Hello!

1426
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:29,208
Aunt! This is Revathy speaking.

1427
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:32,458
Revathy? Who is Revathy?
Stupid girl!

1428
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:38,625
Why have you called? Because of you,
we have lost our prestige and respect.

1429
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:39,750
Aunt! Please listen to me.

1430
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,750
Do not come even if I die.

1431
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,708
I will not attain peace if you come.

1432
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:47,375
We have forgotten you.
You go and die!

1433
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:50,750
Hey! Who was it?

1434
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,958
It was Revathy.
- Revathy?

1435
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:55,458
Did you ask
about her whereabouts?

1436
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:57,458
Why should I bother about it?

1437
01:22:57,583 --> 01:23:02,166
You didn't ask! You! I will kill you!
- Don't do that, sir. - What do I do!

1438
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,625
Sir, what is this? You pick up the sickle
for anything and everything. - You will suffer!

1439
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,041
We have to put them in jail.

1440
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:08,541
But it looks as if you will
go to jail after killing her.

1441
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:09,875
I don't care!
- Sir, don't.

1442
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,291
I do not mind going to jail
after killing this fool. - Calm down.

1443
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:13,416
Doesn't she have a brain?
If she had spoken for 2 more minutes

1444
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,416
we could have traced her whereabouts.
- Have patience.

1445
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:18,625
So much for your unnecessary anger! - Calm down!
- At this age, sit quietly in a corner!

1446
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:20,208
My aunt is a fool.

1447
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:23,958
Ma'am, had you spoken for two minutes

1448
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,166
we could have found out where they are.

1449
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,458
Okay, leave it!
She will call again.

1450
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,583
Do not get tense. Be patient.
- Yes.

1451
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,791
Let me calm down.

1452
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:36,500
Why are you holding this
like a demon?

1453
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:45,500
Listen to me.
- Leave me.

1454
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:48,541
One minute.
- Leave me. You come here, sir.

1455
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:51,375
Sir, please be calm.
Talk patiently, softly.

1456
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,958
Are you advising me?
- Please, be patient.

1457
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,875
Shall I talk? Shall I talk?

1458
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:57,083
Wait, I'll talk.

1459
01:23:58,083 --> 01:23:59,750
Son! I will talk.
- Shut up!

1460
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,000
Why are you coming in between?
- I will talk.

1461
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,166
You are too much!
- I'll talk to him, be quiet.

1462
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:04,583
I will talk.

1463
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,458
Sit quietly. Sit.

1464
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,958
Revathy!
It is your brother talking.

1465
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:19,875
Brother-in-law!
This is Kannan speaking.

1466
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,416
I will beat you.

1467
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:24,708
Who is your brother-in-law? If you're
brave enough, tell me where you are.

1468
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,500
I will come and kill you.

1469
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:29,125
If I see you in person, I will kill you.

1470
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,708
What is he saying?

1471
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,041
He is calling me 'Brother-in-law'.

1472
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:35,458
If you would have spoken,
he would have called you 'Uncle'.

1473
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:38,208
How dare he call me
his brother-in-law!

1474
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:40,250
Why are you getting so tense?

1475
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,208
This happened because of you ladies.
You were with her.

1476
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:43,458
If you talk like this,
your blood pressure will rise.

1477
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:45,708
I don't care.
I am talking like this because of them.

1478
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,208
It's because of them.

1479
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:48,500
My head is spinning.

1480
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:51,041
Oh! He called me 'Brother-in-law'!

1481
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:52,333
'Brother-in-law'!

1482
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:53,958
'Brother-in-law'!

1483
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:55,750
'Brother-in-law'!

1484
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:58,083
He called me 'Brother-in-law'.
- What happened to him?

1485
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:00,041
Brother-in-law!

1486
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:04,041
Mr. Perumal!
Why are you blabbering like this?

1487
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,375
What's the matter?
Tell us.

1488
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,916
That Kannan! He called me
'Brother-in-law' over the phone.

1489
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:11,666
Is this the time to fulfill the vow?
- What are you talking about?

1490
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:13,500
Who has taken the vow?

1491
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,916
I haven't.
- Haven't you?

1492
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:16,125
What about you?
- I don't know.

1493
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,250
How about you?
- I haven't taken any vow.

1494
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:20,625
Have you? - I haven't.
- Even you haven't. - No, I haven't.

1495
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:21,708
In that case, I'll hit you all!

1496
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:27,583
Mr. Perumal! I will ask you something.
- What is it?

1497
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:29,416
Now, I'll ask him.

1498
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,208
What is it?
- What is this in your house?

1499
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:34,208
Love birds.
- You will keep love birds in your house.

1500
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:36,458
But will you oppose
if somebody is in love?

1501
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:39,416
You should ask like this.
Come, let us go home.

1502
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:40,833
Come, let's go.

1503
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:42,666
Hey, Modu Mutti!

1504
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:46,500
What is it?
- Why should I listen to your advice?

1505
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,625
That's but natural.
- Even dying is natural.

1506
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:51,375
Then, why have you kept
love birds in your house? Free them all.

1507
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:58,625
"The gentle breeze blowing
from the flowers touch me."

1508
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:03,750
"The gentle breeze blowing
from the flowers touch me."

1509
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:06,791
"I can smell the fragrance
of the flowers."

1510
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:09,250
"It seems as if they
are speaking to me."

1511
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:15,833
"I am so happy."

1512
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:22,166
"I am so happy."

1513
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:25,083
Hey! Does it look like
he has run away from his village?

1514
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:27,000
He looks as if he has come
to Munnar for his honeymoon.

1515
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:28,958
Buddy! Where are we going now?

1516
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:31,458
Why do you ask?
We are going to your house.

1517
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:32,916
What?
To my house?

1518
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:35,166
Buddy, whom do we have other than you?

1519
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:37,333
Yes, you will not find an idiot like me.

1520
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:39,208
Why are you talking like that?

1521
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:42,541
We can get two lovers married.

1522
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:44,208
But how can we stop a marriage

1523
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:45,500
and make two people
fall in love with each other?

1524
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,708
Then, why did you kidnap this girl?
- What?

1525
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,208
I will hit you if you say, I kidnapped her.

1526
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:51,416
Okay. Leave it.
All of us have kidnapped her.

1527
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:54,125
Poor girl!
Now, we cannot leave her in the lurch.

1528
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:56,583
Neither can we send her back
to her house.

1529
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:59,375
If we leave her now,
she may commit suicide.

1530
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:03,041
I should commit suicide
for being your friend.

1531
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:05,166
Since we are his friends,
that will surely happen one day.

1532
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:06,500
That is not important now.

1533
01:27:06,791 --> 01:27:08,958
We should go to your house now.
What should we do for that?

1534
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:11,958
Okay! On one condition.

1535
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:14,500
We have to lie
that their registered marriage is over.

1536
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:17,250
Okay?
- Lies? He will say that very easily.

1537
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:19,500
Buddy! You have to lie.

1538
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:22,625
Hey! Why are you asking me to lie?

1539
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:24,041
What did you just ask?

1540
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:26,666
I don't lie..

1541
01:27:26,791 --> 01:27:31,416
I will break your teeth. We are
in this state because of your lies. Fool!

1542
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:34,291
Leave it!
I just have to lie

1543
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,791
that our registered marriage is over,
right?

1544
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:38,500
Are you not worried at all?

1545
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:41,541
Why should I worry?
You have kidnapped the girl.

1546
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:43,541
He's killing us.
- Okay.

1547
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:50,583
Look at his performance!
- There is a problem.

1548
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,083
When we go to Nair's house

1549
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:59,250
we have to lie
that our registered marriage is over.

1550
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:00,583
Please.

1551
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,375
Alright.
Say whatever you want.

1552
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:07,208
Say that we have a child
who is in the hostel

1553
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:11,916
and that I am pregnant now.
Say whatever you want.

1554
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:14,750
Do I have to teach you how to lie?

1555
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:19,166
You all talk as if I am always lying.

1556
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:25,541
Buddy! Please listen to me
without getting angry.

1557
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:29,125
What is it?
- You can control your anger, but I..

1558
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,750
You.. - My bladder is full.
I can't control it anymore.

1559
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:34,208
If you can pull over for sometime

1560
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:36,291
I will pass urine and come back soon.
That's not possible.

1561
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,833
Then, give me a plastic bag.

1562
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:39,291
I will use that
and throw it outside.

1563
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:42,041
He may urinate in the car itself.
Pull over the car.

1564
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:44,833
Please pull over soon.
It's urgent.

1565
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:46,916
Get down, get down.

1566
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,500
If somebody tries to run away..

1567
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,833
Get down. Hurry up.
- ...I will kill him.

1568
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:53,583
Go, Go, Go.
- Go fast.

1569
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:57,958
I have lots of work to do.
Make it quick.

1570
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,208
What is it that you did till now?

1571
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:02,166
He is annoying me by addressing me
as his brother-in-law, over the phone.

1572
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:04,125
It was Modu Mutti
who had challenged Kannan

1573
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,125
to address you
as 'brother-in-law'.

1574
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,958
He said, he would help in uniting them
if Kannan won the challenge.

1575
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:11,625
I do not know anything. Oh, God!
- Revathy

1576
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:15,250
is responsible for whatever happened, uncle.
It is her fault.

1577
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:19,125
Hey! Look at that car.
It looks like Das's car.

1578
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,666
Yes, it is his car indeed.

1579
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:24,958
If I try to control it anymore,
my bladder will burst!

1580
01:29:27,041 --> 01:29:28,625
Oh, my God!
- It is Das indeed.

1581
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:30,333
Why is he urinating here?

1582
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:32,416
Didn't he find
any other place on this highway

1583
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:33,875
to urinate?

1584
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,041
Sorry, police.

1585
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:39,958
You all are here!

1586
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:43,875
Modu Mutti! How come you are here?

1587
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:48,916
I escaped from them.
Did you escape too?

1588
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:50,958
Why don't you speak?
Speak up. - They are behind us.

1589
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:53,166
Do you know something?

1590
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:56,166
What are you saying?

1591
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:59,291
That girl..
Well..

1592
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,500
"Let the conch blow."

1593
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,916
Your mustache is very nice.
Shall I go?

1594
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,666
Sir!

1595
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,833
Hey, Modu!
Could Sachin have hit a century?

1596
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:30,208
We are almost dead here
and you're worried about his century!

1597
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:33,875
This swelling looks like the cricket ball,
right? I will kill you!

1598
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,250
Modu Mutti!
I'm unable to see the bars before me.

1599
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:39,166
We haven't gone to jail yet.

1600
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:42,291
The people in your village
thrash very badly.

1601
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,583
They are quite skilled at that.

1602
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:47,125
Why are you not bleeding even after
getting thrashed so badly?

1603
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,708
I've suffered internal injuries.
I'm sure, I'm bleeding internally.

1604
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:51,791
That means, I can't
see you bleeding. - Shut up!

1605
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,625
Is that what you've come for,
from Bombay?

1606
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:58,083
As the time passes,
their urge to kill us is increasing.

1607
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:00,750
Hey! Do you know something?

1608
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:01,916
What?

1609
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,875
That girl never loved Kannan.

1610
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:08,625
That's what I've been saying
right from the beginning.

1611
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,583
People like us will understand things
only after getting thrashed.

1612
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,625
They have spared us alive

1613
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:15,333
only because they think
that Revathy loves Kannan.

1614
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:19,708
If they come to know of the truth,
they will kill us without any hesitation.

1615
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:23,458
Buddy, you didn't reveal the truth
even after getting thrashed.

1616
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:26,666
You have proved your friendship.

1617
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:31,250
Tea. It is okay. They will get us tea again
in the next village. I'll drink it then.

1618
01:31:31,375 --> 01:31:33,125
Come, let us go.
- Come on.

1619
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,291
Don't try to romance here.
Control yourself.

1620
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:40,208
As if she will romance with me.
- Shut up, you fool!

1621
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:43,375
I have told everything
to my mom alone.

1622
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:47,000
Who is that funny looking person?

1623
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,458
Don't you provide
uniform for the watchman?

1624
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:52,666
He is not a watchman.
He is my grandpa.

1625
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:56,416
He's a very cunning person.
Do not talk to him much.

1626
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:58,750
Just greet him
and come inside. Okay?

1627
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:00,875
He is drinking grape juice
in this cold weather.

1628
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,208
It is not grape juice.
It is rum.

1629
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:05,291
He is drinking it, using a straw
so that no one finds it out.

1630
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:10,125
Is it so?
- He looks innocent but he is very cunning.

1631
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:13,416
Buddy! Give me a hand shake.
- Why?

1632
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:16,583
We never knew that we will
get such a grand welcome.

1633
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:18,708
This welcome is not for you.

1634
01:32:18,916 --> 01:32:21,125
The festival begins tonight.
Everyone's getting ready for that. Come.

1635
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,666
Festival?
- He has too high expectations!

1636
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:25,291
Had we known about it earlier, we could
have asked Jil Jil Ramamani to come here.

1637
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:26,666
You..
Let's go.

1638
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:27,833
Okay.
- Come.

1639
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:31,958
My grandpa is an expert
in preparing herbal medicines.

1640
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:34,625
Greetings, sir! Bless me.
- Bless you.

1641
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:39,750
What is this? - Hi. - The three of you
have brought just one girl!

1642
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:43,458
You continue drinking this.
I will tell you the whole story later.

1643
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:46,250
Mom, sister!
They are my friends from Kayathur.

1644
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:49,000
She is my mother and she is my sister.
- Bless me. - God bless you.

1645
01:32:49,125 --> 01:32:50,541
Hey, she is my sister.
Does she look elder to you?

1646
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,041
I am good brother.
- Hi.

1647
01:32:52,291 --> 01:32:54,750
I am her own brother. Be careful.
- I wanted to say, I'm Nalla Thambi.

1648
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:59,375
Take them inside. Hurry up. - Ma'am..
- Come here. Speak to grandpa.

1649
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:01,666
I am Manju, his sister.

1650
01:33:02,416 --> 01:33:04,750
Dear, what is your name?
- Revathy.

1651
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:07,458
Why do you look so dull?

1652
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:09,625
Is it because
you are away from your family?

1653
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:12,375
Everything will fall in place soon.

1654
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:16,083
My grandson had told
that Kannan and Revathy

1655
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:19,625
had a registered marriage
after opposing her family.

1656
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,208
Grandpa! I am here.

1657
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:23,416
Okay.
I know, you're there.

1658
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:27,791
You do not worry.
You can stay in my guesthouse.

1659
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:32,041
I will offer you a job
in my construction company.

1660
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:33,375
Grandpa!

1661
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,875
You will be the chief engineer.

1662
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,333
What about me?

1663
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:40,833
I have thought of a good post
for you. - Good post?

1664
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:43,625
For the workers there, you..

1665
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,916
Grandpa!
- You will be the supervisor.

1666
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:48,708
Thank God.
- He is so naughty even at this age.

1667
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,500
I am very happy

1668
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,208
despite all the problems.

1669
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:55,666
Hey! You are standing idle.
Ask me, why I am happy. - Why?

1670
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:58,875
You are happy since you have settled
in a place safely without any ruckus.

1671
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,291
No.
- Then?

1672
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:04,416
My girl has come with me.
Moreover, I am drunk.

1673
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:07,166
Watch how I will dance during the festival
tonight. Let's enjoy!

1674
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:09,250
You don't have to dance. You've
messed up things back in our village.

1675
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:10,500
We cannot take it anymore.

1676
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:14,000
Shut up! I will check if she is ready.

1677
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:16,958
Grandpa, you asked us to come together.
Right? I will go and bring her. - Okay, go.

1678
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:18,583
Hey, Revathy darling!

1679
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:22,041
Come in for a moment. You're going to have it
from me. - She's calling me so affectionately.

1680
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:26,125
I'll be back. - You have only one minute.
Come fast. - Bye.

1681
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,250
Come.

1682
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:29,791
She is closing the door.

1683
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,208
Are you out of your senses?

1684
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,583
All these problems have arisen

1685
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:34,916
only because you were
drunk yesterday.

1686
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:37,125
Do you want to drink
and create problems here too?

1687
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,541
It's nothing as such, Revathy.

1688
01:34:38,666 --> 01:34:40,833
My wedding got called off
because of you.

1689
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:43,708
I am worried thinking
about the situation there.

1690
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:47,125
Wretched man!
Do you want to dance?

1691
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:51,125
Somebody is knocking
at the door.

1692
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,416
You are still here!

1693
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,166
Sir, I am not coming.

1694
01:34:57,291 --> 01:35:00,041
You go. I have something important
to do tonight.

1695
01:35:00,166 --> 01:35:04,125
Oh! I see.

1696
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:07,291
Do you always talk like a fool?

1697
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:08,708
What have I said wrong?

1698
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:11,166
I understand, I fully understand.

1699
01:35:11,291 --> 01:35:13,416
I understand completely.

1700
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:17,125
Today is your wedding night!
- Oh, God! - Enjoy!

1701
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:20,083
One more thing.
In this very room, my son, my grandson

1702
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:24,875
and I had celebrated
our first night.

1703
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:29,541
Even the cot must've become weak.
Enjoy. I won't disturb you.

1704
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:31,875
I will knock at the door
tomorrow morning.

1705
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But I will come very late. Okay?

1706
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:38,875
Sir!
- You fool!

1707
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:43,958
As it is, she scolds me for petty matters.
On top of that, sir is making things worse.

1708
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:47,958
Hello!
- Yes.

1709
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,333
That girl is waiting for you eagerly.

1710
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:54,125
Are you still here?
Go away!

1711
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:55,833
Oh, God!

1712
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:05,666
What is it?

1713
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:09,208
Go to sleep.
- And then?

1714
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:14,166
If you have a problem sleeping here,
you may sleep on the floor.

1715
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:18,958
What did you say?
- No, I meant, I will sleep on the floor.

1716
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:22,666
She keeps glowering at me
for everything.

1717
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:24,625
The bed is all yours.

1718
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,458
Kannan! Somebody is knocking
at the door.

1719
01:36:56,583 --> 01:36:57,708
Go and open it.

1720
01:36:58,083 --> 01:36:59,333
You go and open it.

1721
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,375
What if it's your father?

1722
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:04,875
Oh! What to do now?

1723
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:08,791
You run away from the backdoor.
I will open the door.

1724
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:09,958
Get lost!

1725
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:13,750
I should run away?
What an insult!

1726
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:18,250
Hey! I will take care.

1727
01:37:20,291 --> 01:37:22,750
Revathy is not at fault.
It's my mistake.

1728
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,708
I am responsible for everything.
Kill me if you want.

1729
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,583
Her brother will come
and kill you. Move aside.

1730
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,458
Grandpa, prepare soon.
- Hey, where are you going?

1731
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:33,541
A snake has bitten
one of the dancers.

1732
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:36,416
Poor guy. He should be given medicines.
Hurry up.

1733
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:39,166
Yes, that snake has to be treated immediately.
- What!

1734
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:42,541
The dancer has to be treated.
I came to take the medicines.

1735
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:44,791
Why should you come here for that?
- The medicines are in your room.

1736
01:37:44,916 --> 01:37:48,083
We have come to take it. Come, grandpa.
Let's not waste time. - Okay.

1737
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:50,833
Sit properly, else you'll die.

1738
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:52,458
It is hurting.

1739
01:37:52,916 --> 01:37:54,833
Which snake has bitten him!

1740
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,916
It's this snake..

1741
01:37:57,083 --> 01:38:00,833
Idiot! You are showing the snake
as if you are showing a glass of milk!

1742
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:06,708
Do not get scared.
Allopathic medicine can't cure this.

1743
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:08,250
It can cure
only specific types of snake bites.

1744
01:38:08,375 --> 01:38:10,541
Hence, I am giving him
herbal treatment.

1745
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:13,458
If you place the herb
on the wound and wrap it

1746
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:17,125
the poison will not affect him.

1747
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:21,541
However, there's a condition.
He should not sleep the whole night.

1748
01:38:21,666 --> 01:38:26,875
If he sleeps, this poison
will spread and he will die.

1749
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,208
Be careful.
Don't let him sleep.

1750
01:38:29,375 --> 01:38:30,833
Okay, Doctor.
- Even I will keep checking on him.

1751
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:34,666
Hey! Do not sleep,
open your eyes, do not sleep.

1752
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:37,791
Somebody start singing
so that he doesn't sleep.

1753
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:45,416
Sir.
- Yes, sir.

1754
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:46,583
I will kill you.

1755
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:48,375
If you sing, he will not survive

1756
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:51,541
but everyone here will die.
He will die after listening to your song.

1757
01:38:51,666 --> 01:38:53,291
Then, you sing.
- You stop singing.

1758
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,791
My friend will sing.

1759
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:57,041
Buddy! You sing.

1760
01:38:57,166 --> 01:38:58,875
Sing sir.
Sing a song.

1761
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:35,583
"There is nobody like you, here."

1762
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:40,125
"But you never loved me."

1763
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:43,833
"You never supported me."

1764
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:49,166
"You never supported me."

1765
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:53,375
"There is nobody like you, here."

1766
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:57,958
"But you never touched me."

1767
01:39:58,083 --> 01:40:01,500
"I kept staring at you
and could not sleep."

1768
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:05,750
"I kept staring at you
and could not sleep."

1769
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:27,166
"Your eyes are very bright
like the blazing fire"

1770
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:31,833
"but you never saw me."

1771
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:35,333
"You never spoke to me affectionately."

1772
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:39,375
"You never spoke to me affectionately."

1773
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:44,041
"I forced you to speak to me
and I winked at you lovingly."

1774
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:50,041
"I forced you to speak to me
and I winked at you lovingly."

1775
01:40:50,166 --> 01:40:54,875
"But you didn't speak to me at all."

1776
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,541
"You do not want to marry me."

1777
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:03,125
"You do not want to marry me."

1778
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:09,833
"There is nobody like you, here."

1779
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:14,208
"But you never loved me."

1780
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:19,041
"You never supported me."

1781
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,208
"You made me cry,
you made me look like a fool"

1782
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:51,791
"but you never accepted
my love."

1783
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:55,375
"I got lost,
but you never searched for me."

1784
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,250
"I got lost,
but you never searched for me."

1785
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:04,083
"You hid your love for me."

1786
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:10,166
"You hid your love for me."

1787
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:14,916
"But you never hid me
in your heart."

1788
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:18,541
"However,
I am still in love with you."

1789
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:22,791
"However,
I am still in love with you."

1790
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:31,666
"There is nobody.."

1791
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:35,125
"There is nobody like you, here."

1792
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:38,583
"But you never loved me."

1793
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:43,125
"She will certainly love you."

1794
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:46,875
"You never supported me."

1795
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,583
"You never supported me."

1796
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:55,791
"I kept staring at you
and could not sleep."

1797
01:42:55,916 --> 01:42:59,458
"I kept staring at you
and could not sleep."

1798
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:04,958
"She will certainly love you."

1799
01:43:21,666 --> 01:43:23,541
He has bought stuff only for me.

1800
01:43:30,458 --> 01:43:33,875
Can you help me?
- What is that?

1801
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,291
Please find a girl for me, here,
in Kerala

1802
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:40,500
and fix me up with her, the way
I helped to fix you up with Revathy.

1803
01:43:40,666 --> 01:43:46,416
If you do that, I'll work extra time
in the construction company

1804
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:48,208
and lead my life.

1805
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:50,541
Is it a bad idea?

1806
01:43:50,666 --> 01:43:53,666
No, it's not that.
Love is not an ordinary matter.

1807
01:43:53,833 --> 01:44:00,083
You need some maturity
to love and marry a girl.

1808
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:05,791
Mr. Gopalakrishnan!
- What is it?

1809
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:07,875
That girl does not love you.

1810
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,666
You are the one who's going behind
that girl shamelessly. Okay?

1811
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:17,958
Why that smile?
- You fool!

1812
01:44:18,083 --> 01:44:20,583
Do you know what happened yesterday,
on our wedding night? - What happened?

1813
01:44:20,916 --> 01:44:23,916
<i><font color="white">What is he thinking?
- Could he be lying again?</i></font>

1814
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:27,125
<i><font color="white">What happened, buddy?
- This is good.</i></font>

1815
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:32,166
She came to the room
with a glass of milk.

1816
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:35,333
Okay.
- I was lying on the bed.

1817
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:40,708
She kept the glass aside
and fell at my feet at once.

1818
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:43,000
I was shocked.

1819
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,041
Why should you be shocked?
You are her lover.

1820
01:44:45,166 --> 01:44:49,875
Listen. I asked her to lie down
on the bed.

1821
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:52,166
But she refused
and asked me to sleep on the bed.

1822
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:54,416
She said, she would sleep
on the floor.

1823
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:56,458
So, nothing happened between you both?

1824
01:44:56,583 --> 01:44:58,250
There were chances.

1825
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:00,666
She also agreed.
But I refused.

1826
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:02,208
You messed it up.

1827
01:45:02,333 --> 01:45:04,000
Why?
- Kannan..

1828
01:45:04,125 --> 01:45:07,208
If something would have happened
between you both last night

1829
01:45:07,333 --> 01:45:09,041
you would have had a baby.

1830
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:12,125
Then, when her family
comes here looking for you

1831
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:17,708
they will forget everything and be happy
after looking at the baby.

1832
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:20,458
Is it?
- Yes.

1833
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:25,791
Don't you have a brain?
Will you believe whatever he says?

1834
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:28,458
She is talking to you.
- Is it? You're right, Revathy.

1835
01:45:28,583 --> 01:45:33,166
He told me about the bed
and the glass of milk

1836
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:37,166
but he said that nothing happened
between you both. Who is he fooling?

1837
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:40,416
That means, Revathy is going
to be pregnant soon. - Idiot!

1838
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:42,208
Kannan! - He will lose his ear
for sure. - Get lost.

1839
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:46,250
I get slapped on the same cheek
every time. I will leave. Bye.

1840
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:49,208
I wonder,
on which cheek she will hit me!

1841
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:52,250
Hi!
- Reform yourself.

1842
01:45:52,875 --> 01:45:58,291
Revathy! My friends
say that I've ruined your life.

1843
01:45:58,666 --> 01:46:01,583
Moreover, in front of them,
you said that you don't love me.

1844
01:46:01,708 --> 01:46:05,000
Therefore, I'm pleasing myself
by saying such things.

1845
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:09,458
Revathy! Do whatever you feel is right.
I will not compel you.

1846
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:13,000
I will keep talking like this..

1847
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:18,458
All these little things
make our life beautiful.

1848
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:22,625
Was the dialogue outdated?

1849
01:46:32,041 --> 01:46:35,250
Hello!
- Mom! This is Kannan.

1850
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:39,333
Kannan! Where are you?

1851
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:42,791
How are you? Is that girl fine?

1852
01:46:42,916 --> 01:46:47,958
Mom, she is fine. There's no problem.
One important thing.

1853
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:49,666
Just a minute.

1854
01:46:51,166 --> 01:46:54,416
Tell me.
- How do you prepare fish curry?

1855
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:58,583
The whole village has gone
in search of you.

1856
01:46:58,708 --> 01:47:02,875
They are out to kill you and you're bothered
about the fish curry recipe!

1857
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,833
Do not talk unnecessarily.

1858
01:47:04,958 --> 01:47:07,833
Revathy has asked for fish curry.
I need to cook for her.

1859
01:47:08,125 --> 01:47:10,833
Just give me the recipe.

1860
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:14,458
Take small onions.

1861
01:47:14,583 --> 01:47:16,750
Okay.
- Take tomatoes.

1862
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:18,250
Okay.

1863
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:22,500
Fry onions and tomatoes in oil.
- Alright.

1864
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:24,666
Add tamarind pulp to it.

1865
01:47:24,791 --> 01:47:26,166
Done.

1866
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:30,000
Add salt, after it boils,
add fish and boil it for 5 minutes.

1867
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:32,458
I know that. Hang up
and continue crying.

1868
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:36,166
<i><font color="white">Hope she gets impressed
after having this fish curry. - Wow!</i></font>

1869
01:47:37,166 --> 01:47:41,333
Revathy! Are you ready?
First, let me serve you rice.

1870
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:50,041
Here's the special fish curry.

1871
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:51,375
Nice.

1872
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:57,083
Here, have it.

1873
01:48:00,333 --> 01:48:01,916
How is it?

1874
01:48:02,625 --> 01:48:04,833
It tastes just like the way
your mom prepares it.

1875
01:48:09,125 --> 01:48:11,916
"Let the flower-like face smile."

1876
01:48:12,041 --> 01:48:14,541
"Let the bee-like mind fly."

1877
01:48:14,666 --> 01:48:16,958
"Let the flower-like face smile."

1878
01:48:17,416 --> 01:48:19,625
"Let the bee-like mind fly."

1879
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:22,708
"Let it flutter for love
and yearn for the moon."

1880
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:25,041
"Let it forget this world."

1881
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:28,000
I can dance better than them.
- Is it so?

1882
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,708
The situation has changed.

1883
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:48,750
Hey! Enough, come.
- Sir.

1884
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:51,125
You dance really well.
- Thank you, sir.

1885
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:54,666
Your head looks like a tender coconut.
- Thank you so much, sir.

1886
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:56,416
Hey, Modu Mutti..
- What is it, sir?

1887
01:48:56,541 --> 01:48:59,583
You are a very nice person.
- Thanks. Let me drink some.

1888
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:03,041
Hey, you! You are also a very nice person.
- Can I go home, sir?

1889
01:49:03,291 --> 01:49:05,083
I told that you are a good person.
Did I ask you to go home?

1890
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:07,375
Did I ask you to go home?
- Keep quiet.

1891
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,041
Radha!
- Sir.

1892
01:49:10,166 --> 01:49:12,750
You are also a good person.
- Thanks.

1893
01:49:13,458 --> 01:49:14,416
Just now, I told you
that you are a good person.

1894
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:15,791
Can't a good person drink liquor?

1895
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:18,000
Hey, even you are a nice person.

1896
01:49:18,291 --> 01:49:20,666
Do you expect me to say that?
- Yes. - Idiot!

1897
01:49:20,791 --> 01:49:23,541
Weren't you the one who had gone
to the groom's house to stop the marriage?

1898
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:26,125
If you beat me anymore, I will die.
- Then, die!

1899
01:49:26,291 --> 01:49:28,125
Die!
- You are beating me alone.

1900
01:49:28,458 --> 01:49:31,875
Look! He is provoking him to hit us.
- He is a fool. - Stop crying!

1901
01:49:33,291 --> 01:49:35,833
How can you all be blamed
for Kannan's mistake?

1902
01:49:35,958 --> 01:49:38,000
My hands are aching hitting you.
Isn't it, Inspector? - Yes, sir.

1903
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:39,666
Sir, why don't you beat him,
for a change?

1904
01:49:39,791 --> 01:49:43,833
What did you just say?
- Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

1905
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:50,375
Tell me, father.
- Are you still searching for them?

1906
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,958
We will find her very soon.

1907
01:49:52,083 --> 01:49:54,333
Do whatever you want.
Spend as much money as you want.

1908
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:56,291
I should see my daughter
tomorrow morning.

1909
01:49:56,458 --> 01:49:59,250
If you cannot find her, leave it.
I will find her.

1910
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:01,333
Father! Do not talk like that.

1911
01:50:02,208 --> 01:50:05,583
I will come with his body.
Believe me.

1912
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:06,708
Hang up the phone.

1913
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:11,250
Get up. Get up.
- He's back to normal after that call.

1914
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,583
Tell me!
- Oh, God!

1915
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,708
Tell me!
- Don't hit me!

1916
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:20,083
Tell me!
- Look at me!

1917
01:50:20,791 --> 01:50:22,958
Look at me.
- I will kill you!

1918
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:26,375
You were the person who was
with them when they ran away.

1919
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:30,416
You know everything. Tell me the truth.
Otherwise, I will kill you.

1920
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:33,708
I was there with them. But they
went away leaving me behind.

1921
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:37,666
I had another friend with me.
His name is Nair and he is from Kerala.

1922
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:42,166
They might have gone to Kerala.
- Finally! - Sir, don't..

1923
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:45,541
Did you hear that, uncle? It was all planned.
He has taken them to Kerala. - Those two..

1924
01:50:45,666 --> 01:50:48,166
Take them along!
- Drive to Kerala!

1925
01:50:50,125 --> 01:50:51,916
Kannan! What's your qualification?

1926
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:53,375
Diploma, 7th year.

1927
01:50:53,583 --> 01:50:55,791
How could have I studied with friends
like your brother around me?

1928
01:50:55,916 --> 01:50:57,583
I heard, you failed
in the 6th standard.

1929
01:50:57,708 --> 01:50:59,458
You have to do something for me.

1930
01:50:59,875 --> 01:51:00,833
Tell me, ma'am.

1931
01:51:00,958 --> 01:51:04,000
We have got a good alliance
for my daughter.

1932
01:51:04,166 --> 01:51:08,208
The groom belongs to a rich family.
But I wonder, if she would be interested.

1933
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:12,375
Can you talk to her and find out
if she has anybody else on her mind?

1934
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:15,625
If I ask her, she may not tell.

1935
01:51:15,875 --> 01:51:18,166
So, I am asking you
to do me this favor.

1936
01:51:19,166 --> 01:51:20,750
Do not mistake me, ma'am.

1937
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:24,708
If Manju is in love with someone,
what will you do?

1938
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:27,208
Oh, that wouldn't be a problem at all.

1939
01:51:27,333 --> 01:51:29,916
If my daughter is in love with someone,
I'll agree for it.

1940
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:33,708
You need not fear.
Just ask her and let me know.

1941
01:51:33,833 --> 01:51:36,208
Okay, ma'am.
I will ask her and let you know.

1942
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,291
What are you thinking?

1943
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:47,166
Manju's mother wanted me to find out
if Manju is in love with somebody.

1944
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:49,000
Go and ask her directly.

1945
01:51:52,083 --> 01:51:55,375
Had my mom been alive, she too would
have asked me the same thing, right?

1946
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:58,333
Had she asked, would you've told her
that you love me?

1947
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:00,333
It's nothing like that.

1948
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:03,166
Stop pretending, Revathy.

1949
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:05,333
When I came to your office
the other day, I took your kerchief.

1950
01:52:05,458 --> 01:52:06,833
Did you not see it?

1951
01:52:07,583 --> 01:52:09,666
No, I did not see that.

1952
01:52:09,791 --> 01:52:11,791
Don't lie.
You did see it.

1953
01:52:11,916 --> 01:52:14,500
Next day, you returned
the liquor bottle.

1954
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:17,166
But why didn't you return my photograph
which was kept with it?

1955
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:20,750
Photo! I did not see it.
- Is it?

1956
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:24,041
Swear by me.
- Why should I swear?

1957
01:52:24,208 --> 01:52:27,208
Come on, Revathy! I came
to rinse your hair in the bathroom

1958
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:29,750
only after I saw my photograph
in your handbag.

1959
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:31,375
How dare you open my handbag!
- Even now..

1960
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:34,041
and not for looking at you
while you were taking bath. - You!

1961
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:35,583
I've hundreds of such facts to tell you.

1962
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,541
She hit me so hard.

1963
01:52:37,875 --> 01:52:40,041
Am I a fool not to realize

1964
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:43,833
whether a girl loves me or not.

1965
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:46,375
I don't know, how longer
we will have to stay here.

1966
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:49,750
Even if we go back tomorrow,
they may accept you.

1967
01:52:49,875 --> 01:52:52,000
But they will kill me for sure.

1968
01:52:52,125 --> 01:52:53,625
I am not worried about that.

1969
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:57,416
Before dying, I just want to hear
you say that you love me.

1970
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,125
I will die happily.

1971
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:04,291
I didn't want all this to happen

1972
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:09,833
and that is why,
I did not express my feelings.

1973
01:53:12,166 --> 01:53:16,750
Your prayers, your true love for me

1974
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:21,291
is what has united us.

1975
01:53:24,666 --> 01:53:26,916
I know you since childhood.

1976
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:28,583
You are a very good person.

1977
01:53:29,166 --> 01:53:31,083
You do not fight with anybody.

1978
01:53:31,916 --> 01:53:33,916
If I say that I am in love
with you

1979
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:36,791
you would come to my house
the very next moment.

1980
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:42,000
You would've got thrashed
by my father and brothers.

1981
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,125
You would have died.

1982
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,500
I do not have the courage
to see that

1983
01:53:49,291 --> 01:53:50,416
because..

1984
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:56,041
I love you so much.

1985
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:01,958
I did not hear it.
Say it again.

1986
01:54:03,791 --> 01:54:05,125
I love you.

1987
01:54:05,625 --> 01:54:08,083
For my sake,
say that in English once.

1988
01:54:09,458 --> 01:54:16,500
I love you..
I love you.

1989
01:54:16,791 --> 01:54:18,583
Are they your relatives?

1990
01:54:19,166 --> 01:54:20,291
I love you.

1991
01:54:20,416 --> 01:54:23,583
Yeah!
- Hey!

1992
01:54:34,958 --> 01:54:36,041
What?

1993
01:54:36,166 --> 01:54:38,083
This is the reason, I didn't
tell you about it, all these days.

1994
01:54:39,208 --> 01:54:40,291
Revathy..

1995
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:49,583
"What can I say?
The earth has stopped revolving."

1996
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:56,208
"What can I say?
I feel like jumping."

1997
01:54:56,791 --> 01:55:03,125
"In that one word of yours,
the world has become beautiful."

1998
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:09,291
"It seems as if the earth is encrusted
in a new layer of drizzles."

1999
01:55:09,875 --> 01:55:15,208
"O, friend.."

2000
01:55:15,458 --> 01:55:22,958
"O, friend.."

2001
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:50,250
"Here, in this very moment,
I agree to die even."

2002
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:54,291
"Say, why did you come
along with me?"

2003
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:57,458
"Your life
is the reason for my decision."

2004
01:55:58,375 --> 01:56:01,875
"I was barren before you professed
your love to me."

2005
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,208
"I came to life only after that."

2006
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:08,666
"I was as sweet as a sugarcane."

2007
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:11,250
"I started to bloom."

2008
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:14,583
"Wherever you go"

2009
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:18,833
"my heart follows you."

2010
01:56:18,958 --> 01:56:25,708
"What can I say?
The earth has stopped revolving."

2011
01:56:25,833 --> 01:56:34,375
"What can I say?
I feel like jumping."

2012
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:05,583
"O, friend.."

2013
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:13,000
"O, friend.."

2014
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:17,208
"I want to kiss you."

2015
01:57:17,333 --> 01:57:20,208
"I want to kiss you."

2016
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:23,791
"I yearn for something."

2017
01:57:23,916 --> 01:57:27,125
"I do not feel like sleeping."

2018
01:57:27,416 --> 01:57:30,916
"Don't I know about you?"

2019
01:57:31,041 --> 01:57:34,333
"I am attracted to you."

2020
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:40,375
"When will you
accept me completely?"

2021
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:43,750
"After I marry you.."

2022
01:57:43,875 --> 01:57:47,125
"I'll love you all my life."

2023
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:53,583
"O, friend.."

2024
01:57:53,958 --> 01:58:00,958
"O, friend.."

2025
01:58:22,083 --> 01:58:23,708
Brother, listen to me.

2026
01:58:23,833 --> 01:58:26,041
You don't deserve to live.
- Kannan is not at fault.

2027
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:28,083
Listen to me just once.
- Come quietly or I'll kill you. - Stop!

2028
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:33,791
Hey! Who are you?
Leave her. Otherwise, I will kill you.

2029
01:58:33,916 --> 01:58:37,708
I am taking my sister home.
Who are you to question that?

2030
01:58:37,916 --> 01:58:41,833
Shut up! If you'd come to take your sister home,
why do you have a sickle in your hand?

2031
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,583
First, drop it.
Otherwise, I will shoot you.

2032
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:49,083
Will you shoot me? - Sir, you never know.
He looks like a crazy fellow.

2033
01:58:49,208 --> 01:58:50,958
Drop the sickle.
Let's talk it out.

2034
01:58:51,125 --> 01:58:53,416
Drop it, sir.
Come on, drop it.

2035
01:58:53,958 --> 01:58:55,375
Revathy, come here.

2036
01:58:57,708 --> 01:58:59,083
Revathy!

2037
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:03,666
If Revathy wants to come with you,
you may take her along.

2038
01:59:03,875 --> 01:59:06,375
Otherwise, go away from here.
If you do not leave, I will kill you.

2039
01:59:06,583 --> 01:59:08,083
Revathy, come here.

2040
01:59:08,708 --> 01:59:10,333
Brother, just listen to me once.

2041
01:59:10,583 --> 01:59:12,208
Kannan is not at fault.

2042
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:15,166
Do not insult us.
Come with us, Revathy.

2043
01:59:15,916 --> 01:59:19,416
Please forgive me. - You heard
your sister's response. Now, go away.

2044
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:22,333
Revathy has refused to come.
You may go now.

2045
01:59:22,541 --> 01:59:27,250
Otherwise, I will shoot you.
Go.

2046
01:59:27,958 --> 01:59:31,083
This is not the right time.
Come, let us go.

2047
01:59:31,375 --> 01:59:33,500
Please come, let us think
of something else. Please come.

2048
01:59:34,375 --> 01:59:36,291
We know how to take you away from here.

2049
01:59:36,416 --> 01:59:37,708
Do you think, you've gotten away?
- Go away.

2050
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:40,208
I will deal with you later.

2051
01:59:40,666 --> 01:59:42,541
Do you know something?
- What is it?

2052
01:59:43,041 --> 01:59:45,833
Revathy loves me.

2053
01:59:48,583 --> 01:59:50,291
What happened?

2054
01:59:51,875 --> 01:59:52,958
I will die.

2055
01:59:53,083 --> 01:59:55,875
She really loves me.
- I will really die.

2056
01:59:56,083 --> 01:59:57,125
No.. You..

2057
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,583
I will write a suicide note holding you both
responsible for my death.

2058
01:59:58,708 --> 02:00:00,916
Please understand.
- You both will not unite till the end.

2059
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:05,291
There are so many in this world
who are in love.

2060
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:07,125
Are you the only person in love?

2061
02:00:07,916 --> 02:00:10,041
I beg of you.

2062
02:00:10,333 --> 02:00:12,791
I'm getting scared of her family.

2063
02:00:13,208 --> 02:00:15,333
Listen to me.
- I am there. Don't get scared.

2064
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:18,083
Even now, I feel that those people
standing in a group there

2065
02:00:18,208 --> 02:00:19,458
with a mustache
are her family members.

2066
02:00:19,583 --> 02:00:21,375
They will not come here..

2067
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:24,291
It's them.

2068
02:00:27,708 --> 02:00:31,416
Nalla Thambi!
How come they are here?

2069
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,083
I will handle them.

2070
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:35,083
He is coming. Do not turn back.

2071
02:00:35,208 --> 02:00:38,000
Be patient. Let him come.
- Slowly, come near the car.

2072
02:00:38,958 --> 02:00:40,833
Greetings, uncle.
Greetings, brother-in-law.

2073
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,958
Why are you standing here?
Come home.

2074
02:00:44,083 --> 02:00:45,208
Have food and go.

2075
02:00:45,333 --> 02:00:47,416
Brother-in-law, Revathy
will be very happy to see you all.

2076
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:49,416
Brother-in-law, is it?
- Yes, brother-in-law.

2077
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:52,625
Brother-in-law, is it?
Seriously?

2078
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:58,583
How dare you call me your brother-in-law!
- Do not beat me, brother-in-law. Please.

2079
02:00:58,875 --> 02:01:00,166
Revathy!

2080
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:02,208
Revathy!

2081
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:04,291
What is it?
- Sir!

2082
02:01:04,416 --> 02:01:08,166
Revathy's brothers are taking Kannan
away in their car. - Sir, don't run.

2083
02:01:08,291 --> 02:01:09,500
Why did you leave him alone?
- He..

2084
02:01:09,625 --> 02:01:12,000
He is a fool!
Have they come here for a feast?

2085
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:15,166
He is inviting them over lunch.
They are already in a fit of rage.

2086
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:19,208
They took him away.
- Sir! Shoot at the wheel.

2087
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:23,041
Crazy fellow!
Nobody can shoot with this gun.

2088
02:01:23,166 --> 02:01:24,166
Why?

2089
02:01:24,291 --> 02:01:26,375
There are no bullets in it.
- Look at him!

2090
02:01:26,875 --> 02:01:28,583
Shut up! Take out the car.

2091
02:01:28,708 --> 02:01:30,125
Somehow, you'll manage things.

2092
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:32,541
Come carefully.
You are the bride. You may fall down.

2093
02:01:32,708 --> 02:01:34,375
You may also fall down.
Come carefully.

2094
02:01:38,416 --> 02:01:41,041
How are you?
- You?

2095
02:01:41,166 --> 02:01:42,791
Forget about me.
Turn back and look.

2096
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:49,625
Modu Mutti!
When did you all come here?

2097
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:52,125
What are you saying!
We haven't been able to go anywhere!

2098
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:56,583
We've been in this car since you left.
We haven't gone home yet.

2099
02:01:56,916 --> 02:01:58,791
But these people are good.

2100
02:01:58,916 --> 02:02:01,500
They are providing us
with liquor and food on time.

2101
02:02:01,625 --> 02:02:05,833
But when they remember you,
they start beating us up. - Yeah.

2102
02:02:05,958 --> 02:02:09,208
But it was like a good tour,
searching for you in different places.

2103
02:02:09,875 --> 02:02:10,916
They took us to different places

2104
02:02:11,041 --> 02:02:12,041
and beat us up

2105
02:02:12,166 --> 02:02:13,166
and you're saying,
it was like a good tour!

2106
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:14,791
They were also drinking liquor often.

2107
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,458
Kannan! Do you know what it meant?

2108
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:20,958
They used to drink liquor
and thrash us.

2109
02:02:21,083 --> 02:02:24,291
What are you all murmuring?
Are you planning your escape?

2110
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,375
Sir, we are practicing
to entertain you.

2111
02:02:34,833 --> 02:02:37,458
You do not worry.
Nothing will happen to Kannan.

2112
02:02:37,708 --> 02:02:40,250
No, sir!
You do not know about my family.

2113
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:44,666
They are so angry that they might do
anything to Kannan.

2114
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:47,458
My aunt alone is capable
of doing anything.

2115
02:02:48,791 --> 02:02:50,875
Nair, drive fast.

2116
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:54,083
She sounds
as if she loves Kannan too.

2117
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:57,291
All our efforts shouldn't go in vain.
Drive fast.

2118
02:03:15,916 --> 02:03:17,541
Move. Move.

2119
02:03:23,958 --> 02:03:27,958
You put us to shame
before the entire village.

2120
02:03:28,083 --> 02:03:30,250
You took away my sister!
- No.

2121
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:33,458
Even if I kill you, my anger
will not subside. - Brother..

2122
02:03:33,583 --> 02:03:37,250
Leave Kannan. Please leave him.
He is not at fault. - Leave me.

2123
02:03:37,375 --> 02:03:40,958
Get away! It would be a shame on us
if we spared him alive.

2124
02:03:41,083 --> 02:03:42,958
Get away. Get lost!
- Brother!

2125
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:47,291
You refused to come with me when I pleaded
with you. Why have you come now?

2126
02:03:47,625 --> 02:03:50,875
I'll kill you!
- Leave him, uncle.

2127
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,666
Die!
- Kannan's not at fault, uncle.

2128
02:03:53,916 --> 02:03:56,291
Kannan is not at fault.
Leave him.

2129
02:03:57,916 --> 02:04:00,833
You've brought shame
to our family!

2130
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:05,791
Father! Ask them not to beat him.
Ask them not to beat him.

2131
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:10,625
He's not at fault, father.
Father, please!

2132
02:04:10,958 --> 02:04:14,333
I beg of you.
I will do as you say.

2133
02:04:14,458 --> 02:04:16,125
Ask them not to beat him, father.

2134
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:17,958
Father.
- Tell me.

2135
02:04:18,125 --> 02:04:19,833
You tarnished our dignity.
- Please, don't hit me.

2136
02:04:19,958 --> 02:04:21,208
Hey!

2137
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,250
We trusted you so much.
What made you do this?

2138
02:04:29,791 --> 02:04:31,625
Listen to me for a minute.

2139
02:04:31,833 --> 02:04:34,458
What do you want to say?
- I did not kidnap your daughter.

2140
02:04:36,041 --> 02:04:37,791
Are you trying to say
that she eloped with you?

2141
02:04:38,166 --> 02:04:41,166
Neither did I kidnap your daughter
nor did she elope with me.

2142
02:04:42,291 --> 02:04:44,208
It's situation that brought us together.

2143
02:04:44,375 --> 02:04:46,833
I knew that my daughter
wouldn't have eloped with you.

2144
02:04:48,291 --> 02:04:51,250
If she had eloped,
I would've committed suicide.

2145
02:04:51,916 --> 02:04:54,208
If it is true that your daughter
didn't elope with me

2146
02:04:54,666 --> 02:04:56,583
then, it's also true
that we both love each other a lot.

2147
02:04:58,083 --> 02:04:59,666
If she was in love with you

2148
02:04:59,875 --> 02:05:02,083
she would not have agreed
to marry the boy of my choice.

2149
02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:04,625
She did not utter a word against it.

2150
02:05:05,458 --> 02:05:07,000
She didn't go against you

2151
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:09,125
because of the love and respect
she has for you and the others in the family.

2152
02:05:09,833 --> 02:05:14,583
If her mother was alive, she would
have asked her for her opinion.

2153
02:05:15,416 --> 02:05:16,916
Did any of you ask her
for her opinion?

2154
02:05:17,291 --> 02:05:18,708
We know what is good for her.

2155
02:05:18,916 --> 02:05:22,791
You need not advise us. It's our mistake
that we haven't killed you yet.

2156
02:05:23,083 --> 02:05:26,166
Give me the knife.
He's talking too much!

2157
02:05:26,291 --> 02:05:28,666
Stop it! Please listen
to what I've to say.

2158
02:05:29,583 --> 02:05:32,958
The present generation is different
from our generation.

2159
02:05:33,083 --> 02:05:38,333
Will this girl be happy
if she marries a rich boy?

2160
02:05:38,666 --> 02:05:39,916
Even now, it is not too late.

2161
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:43,750
You should be very lucky to get
a groom like Kannan for your daughter.

2162
02:05:43,875 --> 02:05:45,916
Hey, you! - Let it be.
- This is not your place.

2163
02:05:46,041 --> 02:05:48,333
If you talk too much

2164
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:50,875
you'll get killed
along with him. Go away!

2165
02:05:51,125 --> 02:05:52,375
You behaved very indecently.

2166
02:05:54,041 --> 02:05:56,625
Hey! Why are you beating him so much?

2167
02:05:56,916 --> 02:05:59,625
I tolerated all your misbehavior
only because my son was at fault.

2168
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:01,208
You hit him
since he took away your girl. Right?

2169
02:06:01,375 --> 02:06:03,625
Now, she has come back.
You should not beat him anymore.

2170
02:06:04,125 --> 02:06:06,541
Forget her.
Come. Let's leave this place.

2171
02:06:06,666 --> 02:06:08,625
Father! Why should we leave this place?

2172
02:06:09,958 --> 02:06:12,833
When will you come
to your senses?

2173
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:15,208
At least, now, listen to me.
Come, let's go.

2174
02:06:15,583 --> 02:06:17,166
Father.
- Let's go. - Stop.

2175
02:06:17,333 --> 02:06:19,708
You think, you can pretend as though you're
consoling your son and take him away?

2176
02:06:19,875 --> 02:06:20,916
Do you think,
we will let him go so easily?

2177
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:23,625
Are you a judge?

2178
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:27,250
My anger will subside
only after I kill your son. - Leave me!

2179
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:15,208
<i><font color="white">I've no idea,
how these two years passed.</i></font>

2180
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:18,750
<i><font color="white">I am working
as a construction engineer in Oman.</i></font>

2181
02:07:19,875 --> 02:07:25,916
<i><font color="white">I got more than I expected in life,
expect for my Revathy.</i></font>

2182
02:07:27,375 --> 02:07:30,791
<i><font color="white">Unable to stay here anymore,
my parents left this place.</i></font>

2183
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:34,541
<i><font color="white">However, I did not want
to sell this house.</i></font>

2184
02:07:35,708 --> 02:07:40,583
<i><font color="white">I still believe, that some day
I will live in this house with Revathy.</i></font>

2185
02:09:01,916 --> 02:09:05,250
In the last two years,
didn't you ever feel like calling me?

2186
02:09:09,208 --> 02:09:10,333
Never mind.

2187
02:09:11,083 --> 02:09:14,125
I have been calling you
everyday at 5:30 a.m.

2188
02:09:14,875 --> 02:09:16,541
Didn't you even feel
like answering it?

2189
02:09:19,458 --> 02:09:23,083
For two years, everyday,
I would wake up at 3 o'clock

2190
02:09:25,583 --> 02:09:27,291
and wait for your phone call.

2191
02:09:29,875 --> 02:09:32,958
Everyone in my family knows
that it is you who is calling.

2192
02:09:33,541 --> 02:09:34,875
Do you know,
why I never answered it?

2193
02:09:35,333 --> 02:09:39,291
Had I attended your call, the phone
would have got disconnected.

2194
02:09:42,958 --> 02:09:43,958
Rev..

2195
02:09:53,375 --> 02:09:56,458
Even now, if my father
learns that you have come

2196
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,083
I fear, something wrong
might happen.

2197
02:10:00,833 --> 02:10:02,375
Please go away from here.

2198
02:10:03,708 --> 02:10:06,750
Within these two years,
if you had married somebody

2199
02:10:07,291 --> 02:10:08,583
I would not have come to see you.

2200
02:10:09,291 --> 02:10:12,250
You're yourself saying that you wake up
at 3 a.m. and wait for my call.

2201
02:10:14,625 --> 02:10:17,458
When you love me so much, why don't
you tell your father about it?

2202
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:21,416
You know about my father
and my family very well.

2203
02:10:23,166 --> 02:10:30,875
They love me immensely,
but they do not understand my feelings.

2204
02:10:33,541 --> 02:10:37,166
Till date, I haven't
asked my father for anything.

2205
02:10:38,708 --> 02:10:41,333
My father has done everything for me.

2206
02:10:43,375 --> 02:10:49,500
I won't be able to bear it if I asked
something and he refused it.

2207
02:10:50,375 --> 02:10:55,166
They know it very well that I will die
if they get me married to somebody else.

2208
02:10:56,083 --> 02:10:57,083
Hence, they won't force me for that.

2209
02:10:58,041 --> 02:11:01,250
Even for the next 60 years

2210
02:11:01,875 --> 02:11:06,041
they may keep me in this house,
but won't get me married to you.

2211
02:11:07,208 --> 02:11:11,208
There is a solution for everything.
You need to take a decision.

2212
02:11:11,375 --> 02:11:16,750
Even now, I can leave my family
behind and come with you.

2213
02:11:17,833 --> 02:11:19,375
But if I come with you

2214
02:11:20,041 --> 02:11:25,375
the affection I have towards my father
and my family will be proved wrong.

2215
02:11:28,041 --> 02:11:31,250
Though I was with you only for few days,
those happy memories

2216
02:11:32,166 --> 02:11:34,833
are sufficient for me to survive.

2217
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:40,500
Please go away from here.
Kannan!

2218
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:42,541
Please.

2219
02:12:09,166 --> 02:12:15,250
Go away. Go.
Don't stand before me.

2220
02:12:16,083 --> 02:12:21,458
I'd have killed you for what you spoke.
But my daughter's words stopped me.

2221
02:12:23,833 --> 02:12:25,875
When she had to make a choice
between her father and you

2222
02:12:27,041 --> 02:12:31,125
she chose her father.
That is enough for me.

2223
02:12:35,875 --> 02:12:40,750
I cannot accept you.
I cannot.

2224
02:12:41,916 --> 02:12:45,083
I am not magnanimous enough
to forgive you and accept you.

2225
02:12:50,041 --> 02:12:52,250
Go.

2226
02:12:54,041 --> 02:12:57,916
Go away.
Go to a faraway place. Go.

2227
02:12:59,791 --> 02:13:02,208
Take her also along with you.

2228
02:13:05,458 --> 02:13:06,666
Father!

2229
02:13:08,333 --> 02:13:11,375
Instead of thinking about him
and suffering everyday

2230
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:15,166
go and live with him.

2231
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:21,833
Go. Live happily.
Go.

2232
02:13:22,333 --> 02:13:26,416
Go from here before he changes
his mind. Take her.

2233
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:29,541
Bye.

2234
02:13:30,291 --> 02:13:31,291
One minute.

2235
02:13:32,166 --> 02:13:33,375
Brother-in-law,
we are leaving.

2236
02:13:34,583 --> 02:13:35,708
Hey! Go.

2237
02:13:36,625 --> 02:13:39,000
Hey!
- Brother-in-law!

2238
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:44,125
Grow your mustache long.
Okay? Go.

2239
02:13:44,666 --> 02:13:46,125
First develop your brain.

2240
02:13:46,416 --> 02:13:47,875
Put it in this.
- Look if someone is coming!

2241
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,583
No one's coming.
Make it fast. Hurry up! - Nalla Thambi!

2242
02:13:49,791 --> 02:13:52,916
They thrashed me 24 times
in these two years.

2243
02:13:53,041 --> 02:13:54,625
At least, you were able to count
the number of times you were thrashed.

2244
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:57,416
But I have been thrashed countless times.
- Is that so? - Not only that..

2245
02:13:57,541 --> 02:13:59,500
Hey! Why are you crying?

2246
02:13:59,666 --> 02:14:01,250
I had arranged
for a party tonight.

2247
02:14:01,375 --> 02:14:02,833
What for?
- It is my birthday today.

2248
02:14:03,041 --> 02:14:05,500
After some time, it will become
your death day. Keep everything inside.

2249
02:14:06,208 --> 02:14:09,416
Hurry up! - Keep it here. - Why are you keeping
it here? - To throw it on people and escape.

2250
02:14:09,541 --> 02:14:12,916
He is coming..
- Come on, hide yourselves. - Sir..

2251
02:14:13,041 --> 02:14:14,250
Don't hide.
- What is it?

2252
02:14:14,458 --> 02:14:15,458
A big function is going
to be held in Kayathur. - So?

2253
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:18,416
500 cups of tea.. - Then?
- 1000 cups of coffee, 2000 fritters.

2254
02:14:18,583 --> 02:14:20,458
What else? - It's a bulk order.
- Is that so?

2255
02:14:21,041 --> 02:14:22,958
Look at this..
Are you talking of bulk order!

2256
02:14:23,083 --> 02:14:25,750
Thrash him.
- Hold him tightly.

2257
02:14:25,875 --> 02:14:28,083
Not even a single person
has come to drink tea

2258
02:14:28,208 --> 02:14:29,375
or coffee all these years.

2259
02:14:29,625 --> 02:14:31,041
Now that I am shutting my shop forever,
I get a bulk order!

2260
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:34,041
Even If I am a little late
in packing fritters, they don't spare me.

2261
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:36,666
Just because I didn't give you salary,
will you fix my wagon?

2262
02:14:36,958 --> 02:14:41,166
Don't spare him. Hit him.
- They have come.

2263
02:14:41,375 --> 02:14:42,625
Lord Ayyappa!
Lord Ayyappa!

2264
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:43,750
Lord Ayyappa! Lord Ayyappa!

2265
02:14:43,875 --> 02:14:45,083
Lord Ayyappa! Lord Ayyappa!

2266
02:14:45,208 --> 02:14:46,416
Lord Ayyappa! Lord Ayyappa!

2267
02:14:46,541 --> 02:14:48,625
Lord Ayyappa! Lord Ayyappa!

2268
02:14:48,791 --> 02:14:51,291
Hey! Modu Mutti!
- Lord Ayyappa! Lord Ayyappa!

2269
02:14:51,958 --> 02:14:53,625
He has sold his shop. You can go.
- Lord Ayyappa!

2270
02:14:54,333 --> 02:14:55,541
Do you think,
I can't recognize this bald head?

2271
02:14:55,666 --> 02:14:57,166
He has seen me!
- What do you want?

2272
02:14:57,291 --> 02:14:59,000
Let's have tea and chat.

2273
02:14:59,125 --> 02:15:00,125
Sure, but I will parcel it for you.

2274
02:15:00,250 --> 02:15:01,583
Sit under that tree, have it
and run away from there.

2275
02:15:01,708 --> 02:15:06,416
Yes, buddy! I beg of you.
Please go away from here.

2276
02:15:06,541 --> 02:15:08,666
Hey! You are asking me to go!

2277
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:11,458
Wait, I will call her. Come.
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2278
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:19,125
This time, we should not go with him
anywhere. We have had enough.

2279
02:15:19,250 --> 02:15:21,541
Oh! He has brought this girl again.
By now

2280
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:23,250
her family members
would have called four cabs

2281
02:15:23,375 --> 02:15:24,916
and 40 people
would be ready with sickles in their hands.

2282
02:15:25,041 --> 02:15:30,416
Keep quiet.
This girl is going to marry me now.

2283
02:15:38,375 --> 02:15:41,958
"Oh! That is not possible."

2284
02:15:42,083 --> 02:15:45,416
"Oh! That is not possible."

2285
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:52,583
"Why would oil
like to be with water?"

2286
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:59,750
"Why would oil
like to be with water?"

2287
02:16:15,541 --> 02:16:20,583
"Like Cauvery is for river,
do you epitomize love?"

2288
02:16:23,125 --> 02:16:26,708
"Like Cauvery is for river,
do you epitomize love?"

2289
02:16:26,833 --> 02:16:33,708
"A town should be like Thanjavur,
there is nobody like you here."

2290
02:16:34,375 --> 02:16:41,708
"A dance like this,
a person like you, a pearl like this."

2291
02:16:41,875 --> 02:16:45,083
"Do not shy away on seeing me."

2292
02:16:45,541 --> 02:16:49,166
"Do not get excited and cling on to me
like a chewing gum."

2293
02:16:49,291 --> 02:16:52,791
"Tell me what is love,
