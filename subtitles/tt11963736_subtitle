1
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,083
Wait, wait...

2
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,167
Bring him out.

3
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,625
Nineteen seventy one.

4
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,917
A winter morning in Kolkata.

5
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:32,125
I was afraid.

6
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,208
Look ahead...

7
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,333
Chinese border.

8
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,458
Your chairman is sitting on a chair.

9
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,542
Go...

10
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,583
I'm letting you go... Go...

11
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,042
Run... Run!

12
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,208
Run!

13
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,667
I was thinking...

14
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,167
How fast do I need to run
to outpace the bullet?

15
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:18,583
KOLKATA 2020

16
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,917
Bultai! Bultai!

17
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,083
Come back.
Sir will be here.

18
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,708
It's ready!
I've written it.

19
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,917
Don't worry.

20
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,333
Sit down.

21
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,958
"DRACULA SIR"

22
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,292
It wasn't me, sir.

23
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,875
Do you know who wrote "Dracula"?

24
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,625
I know, sir.

25
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,708
Written by Haridas Bandyopadhyay.
This is Prakash's book.

00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,750
Ground floor room
next to the road.

"THE FLUTE"

32
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,125
The damp walls have chipped away.

33
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,667
The damp marks on the wall.

34
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:48,375
A picture bound in American canvas.

35
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:53,542
Along with a picture of Lord Ganesha
by the door.

36
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:57,125
Apart from me,
there's a another living being in the room.

37
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,125
Under the same rent.

38
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,000
That's a lizard.

AMOL SHOM
1951-1972

40
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,500
Today is Amol's birthday.

41
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,250
Comrade Amol Shom.

42
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,583
No one could find him.

43
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,208
Amol could not be found anywhere.

44
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,583
At that time...

45
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:40,167
like thousands of other young people...

46
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,167
Amol, too, was missing.

47
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:44,875
Just look at me...

48
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,125
I'm just wasting your time.

49
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,125
- Please forgive me.
- No, I came here on my own.

50
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,042
Thank you... Thank you...

51
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,167
Actually, you know...

52
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,958
Forgetting is human nature.

53
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,875
Who remembers?

54
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,375
It happened such a long time ago.

55
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,833
That was the last awakening
of the Bengalis.

56
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,583
The last wish.

CHAPTER 1
TENANT ON THE GROUND FLOOR

59
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,875
Raktim!

60
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,083
Oh, Raktim!

61
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,083
Have you gone deaf?

62
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,042
Who's going to switch off the light?
My father?

63
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,333
It was switched on all of last night.

64
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,750
You've difficulty paying just the rent.

65
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:32,417
Remember how much the electricity bill
was last month?

66
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,792
Raktim?

67
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,083
Oh, Raktim!

68
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,792
Hiding downstairs for sure.

69
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,375
- I'll switch it off.
- Why?

70
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,875
Why would you switch it off?

71
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,083
Is it your responsibility?

72
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,375
Is he paying you?

73
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,708
Hey, Sabita.
Let him know.

74
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,458
He should vacate soon.

75
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,667
Paresh's uncle...

76
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,375
He has told me.

77
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,208
He has promised to pay me double rent.

78
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,167
He'll move in at a minute's notice.

79
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,000
And after that I'll throw him out.

80
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,333
Just wait and watch.

81
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:07,958
Hey.

82
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,625
You aren't asleep yet?

83
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,042
Go to bed!

84
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,667
He won't fall asleep.

85
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,333
No matter how late it is.
He'll stay up.

86
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,917
He won't sleep.

87
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,833
Raktim!

88
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,542
Raktim!

89
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,000
What's happened?

90
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,875
Are you dead?
What the hell!

91
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,292
Raktim!

92
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,792
Have you seen what a sly man he is?

93
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,292
He isn't making a sound.

94
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,083
Raktim!

95
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,167
Hey, Raktim!

96
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,333
Were you calling me?

97
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,417
That was ages back.

98
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,000
I was in the bathroom.

99
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,792
This naughty boy is not falling asleep.

100
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,667
Put him to sleep.

101
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:06,125
Why do I have to repeat myself every day?

102
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,458
Bultai will go to sleep by himself.

103
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,375
Please don't give me that story.

104
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,208
Go.

105
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,375
Raktim, put him to sleep.

106
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,625
Son of a b♪♪♪h!

107
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,417
Only you can teach him a lesson.

108
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,500
Bultai...

109
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:34,250
Where are you off to?

110
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,750
Bultai.

111
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:14,750
- Come, come, come with me...
- Please let me go...

112
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,917
Let go of me.
I'm not feeling well today.

113
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,208
- Hey! Hey!
- Let me go.

114
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,042
When you eat you don't remember your body?

115
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,250
I'll show you. Wait!

116
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,583
You were rotting in a dump.

117
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,792
I got you out of there.

118
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,583
Was it for nothing?
Huh?

119
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,167
Get in!

120
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,375
Acting coy, huh?

121
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,667
Mom!

122
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,042
Where will you go?

123
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,542
Where will you run to?

124
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,417
How far can you run away?

125
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,291
Hello, Raktim?

126
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:15,292
Hello?

127
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,541
Please hold. One minute.

128
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,832
Sir... Dracula sir...

129
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,917
Hmm...

130
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,292
Hello, sir.

131
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,875
Is this Dracula sir?

132
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,750
My name is Raktim Chowdhury.

133
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,500
We've heard the name Dracula sir
so much...

134
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,917
Heard a lot about you from Head sir.

135
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,375
He gave me your number.

136
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,375
I wanted to talk to you.

137
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,708
Yes, tell me.

138
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,375
Well...

139
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,875
I make films.

140
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,750
Bengali films. Director.

141
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,083
There's a small role.

142
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,542
I have to act?

143
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,833
It's a very small role.
Just a day's work.

144
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,708
But it's highly impactful.

145
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,417
You'll appear in one scene
and steal the show. Simple.

146
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,417
No, no, no.
I can't act at all.

147
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,375
Leave that to me.

148
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,750
Manik could make anyone act.

149
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,292
No... I can't... Please believe me.

150
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,042
I really can't.
I can't act.

151
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,083
Listen... Listen...

152
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:10,750
Before you hang up,
you should consider...

153
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,333
who you are refusing.

154
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,292
DAINIK BARTA
ALAS VIDYASAGAR

155
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,500
Just look at the news, Swagata.

156
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,582
They have desecrated Vidyasagar's statue.

157
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,958
- Can I see that, madam?
- Here.

158
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,583
These are the dark days, sir.

159
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:37,708
- No respect for him in life or death.
- Disgusting! You're right.

160
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,916
- Our society is not civilized enough for him.
- The culture has gone for a toss.

161
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:41,917
You're correct.

162
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,792
Please remain sitting.

163
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,542
Have you seen the news?

164
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,750
What's your opinion about it?

165
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,083
Read it.

166
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:55,750
My opinion...

167
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:59,559
You'll spend the rest of your life
as the school's temporary Bengali teacher.

168
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,791
That's what you're thinking, right?

169
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,167
They're not making me permanent, sir.

170
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,667
Do you give tuition?

171
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,167
You don't? Why?

172
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,625
The parents are scared,
you might bite the kids?

173
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,458
You can't sustain
on a temporary teacher's salary.

174
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,458
You'll be homeless if you lose this job.

175
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,208
Sir, it would be great
if you could help me with the situation.

176
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,250
Subhankar is the son of our trustee.

177
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,601
You couldn't even honour his request.

178
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,833
I can't act, sir.
I can't do it.

179
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,083
Do you think
you know how to teach Bengali?

180
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,792
I try.

181
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,083
Try the acting thing too.

182
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,749
Then I'll try too...

183
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,917
so that you get a permanent position.

184
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,625
There might be something
in the handicapped quota.

185
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,833
Why don't you get a card
showing your teeth?

186
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,333
Call him and apologise.
It'll be good for you.

187
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,750
Hey Raktim!

188
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,791
You gave up the opportunity
to act in a film?

189
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,958
My daughter is still trying
to catch a break.

190
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,958
So what role did they offer you?
A monster or something?

191
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,917
Might be a mythological show.

192
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,958
Where will you go?

193
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,542
Where will you run to?

194
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,083
How far will you run?

195
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,750
Let's see...

196
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,833
Now this side...

197
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,792
Can you open your mouth wider?

198
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:29,083
It's looking a little bigger than before.

199
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,291
It's rare but this can happen.

200
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,207
I don't understand all that, Doc.

201
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,667
I just want to get rid of the teeth.

202
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,791
You have said that before too.
Came in twice before.

203
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,542
Then you just disappeared without a trace.

204
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,082
You can't be so scared.

205
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,457
I lost rest of the milk teeth except for
these two.

206
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:51,208
My mom asked me
not to get them extracted.

207
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,958
But now I've had enough.
Please take them out.

208
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,667
It's easier said than done.

209
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,666
There are lots of things to be done first.

210
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,666
We have to do X-rays.
See the teeth's positioning...

211
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,917
Isn't it?

212
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,083
You know what the other thing is?

213
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,333
Culturally, we are all scared
to be different.

214
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,500
We want to be alike.
In the same group.

215
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:17,583
We want to eat the same food.
We want to think alike.

216
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,874
We want to wear the same clothes.

217
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,416
We want to all look the same.

218
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,542
It's called mediocrity.

219
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,666
But if someone is a little different
then done.

220
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,332
People feel threatened.

221
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,083
Then everyone tries to get him
to their team.

222
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:38,124
And I'll try to help you in this endeavour
definitely.

223
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,624
That means I'll extract your teeth.

224
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,208
But think about it...

225
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,749
When the teeth have come into existence...

226
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,875
There must be a reason.

227
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,458
Those teeth
are trying to make you different.

228
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,333
There are definitely possibilities in you.

229
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,250
Please think about it.

230
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,292
Oh! You're here!

231
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:41,083
I got your photo last night.
I'm Trisha, the assistant director.

232
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,625
Please come with me.

233
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,000
How much longer...

234
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,583
Lunch is served.

235
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,167
Please eat.

236
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,333
Cut!

237
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,875
Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!

238
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,749
- Where is Dracula sir? Okay.
- I'll call him.

239
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,875
Where's the water?

240
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,292
Excellent! Excellent!

241
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,792
Romila, the next scene is with Dracula sir.

242
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,333
- Oh, the real Dracula!
- Yes, yes!

243
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,833
What are you doing here?
The shot is ready.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,083
Give me your plate.
You can eat later.

245
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,583
Come with me.

246
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,292
Please hurry up.

247
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,333
- Subhankar, I was looking fat.
- No, no. You were looking beautiful!

248
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,292
Sir... Dracula sir is here.

249
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,833
Oh wow!

250
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:41,875
The look is suiting you.

251
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,583
I'm Subhankar Banerjee, the director.

252
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:45,792
I had called you.

253
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,500
- Hope you've eaten.
- The next scene.

254
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,167
- Some tea... Production!
- No, no...

255
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,042
- Don't bother...
- I'm done... Mirror!

256
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,167
- Anyway...
- Okay!

257
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,726
Romila, then let's rehearse the scene.

258
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,583
Wait, Subhankar.

259
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,417
I have a scene with him.
Let me get to know him.

260
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,417
We should get comfortable before the scene.

261
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,250
Dracula sir!

262
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:05,583
Do you really have huge teeth?

263
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,707
Show them, please.

264
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,791
The heroine is asking you.
Show her.

265
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:10,916
Please show your teeth.

266
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:14,250
Actually, I really like looking
at rare things.

267
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,833
Please show me.

268
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,875
Please open your mouth and show me.

269
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:22,125
- Take his handkerchief.
- Give it me. Come on.

270
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,417
Please show me, sir.
It's okay.

271
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,832
You've here to show your teeth.
What's your problem?

272
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:31,292
Subhankar, he'll show it to us himself.
Isn't it, sir?

273
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,458
It's okay.

274
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,207
- Show us.
- Show us.

275
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,583
Just show it.

276
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:46,583
Oh my God! Scary, Subhankar!

277
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,833
It takes a lot of effort to make films.

278
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,833
Well, you know the budget
for graphics...

279
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:54,208
Good.

280
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,583
Okay, let's go for the scene.
Let me explain.

281
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,417
Raktim, should we start?

282
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,125
Okay, silence!

283
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:04,291
The crane will come down like this.

284
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,332
Here it comes...
It's right here...

285
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,291
The camera moves this way...

286
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:11,625
- Where's Romila?
- Right here. Tell me.

287
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:15,458
We'll capture the full moon
then we'll come down...

288
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,208
Then the camera moves to the car.

289
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,643
- You'll be driving the car.
- Okay, I'll be driving the car.

290
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,750
You're still driving.
You suddenly hit the brakes.

291
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:32,333
I've thought about crossing paths with you
so many times.

292
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,375
I'll hit the brakes when I see you.

293
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,125
The car will come to a screeching halt.

294
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,583
I'll walk towards you.

295
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,792
And you'll come to me.

296
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,374
And then...

297
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,083
Then...

298
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:52,541
Then what you do is...
You're going to kiss her...

299
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,083
But you don't.

300
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,999
You bite her on the neck. Okay?

301
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,667
What do you mean?
Tell him properly.

302
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,541
Don't actually bite.
You just have to pretend.

303
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,833
You have to do it very technically. Clear?

304
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,542
Then...

305
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,292
Then...

306
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,582
Hey! Idiot!

307
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,375
What are you doing?

308
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,707
Why are rubbing your nose on my neck?
Subhankar, come here!

309
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,082
- Come here!
- Get her tissues.

310
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,499
- What happened?
- See what he's doing.

311
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,059
Doesn't know the technique
and he's come to act!

312
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,916
I've told you not to cast me
in low budget films.

313
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,500
Who is he? Sort this out first
or I won't give the shot.

314
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,726
- No, I mean...
- Romila, wait...

315
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,041
Today is the only day we have the floor.
Romila, please...

316
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:35,583
I can't help it.
First, you teach him. Nonsense!

317
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,333
What did you do?

318
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,667
I told you to do it technically.

319
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:41,917
What are you doing?

320
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,375
Can't even do a simple thing.

321
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,333
Who casts these people?

322
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,000
Just showed up with his big teeth!

323
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,583
Where will you go?

324
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:57,499
Where will you run to?

325
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,292
"Chandana's Love"
32/1, take one!

326
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,083
And action!

327
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,708
How far will you run?

328
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,417
I've thought about crossing paths with you
so many times.

329
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:16,292
"This valley of death is not my country."

330
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,125
The car will come to a screeching halt.

331
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,874
"This immense graveyard
is not my country."

332
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,957
I'll walk towards to you.

333
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,583
And you'll come to me.

334
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,083
And then...

335
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,999
"This executioner's stage..."

336
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,583
Then...

337
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,332
"...is not my country".

338
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,833
Then...

339
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,833
And then...

340
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,875
Then...

341
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,458
Then...

342
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,958
You...

343
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:55,333
And I...

344
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:01,917
And...

345
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,749
- He bit me!
- Cut it!

346
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,375
He really bit me...

347
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,875
Call an ambulance!

348
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:29,667
Contemporary commotion surrounds the grave

349
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:36,417
The familiar criminal noise bursts out

350
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:43,042
Contemporary commotion surrounds the grave

351
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:49,916
The familiar criminal noise bursts out

352
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:56,833
One by one, the houses fall apart
The water comes closer

353
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:04,666
You are in my spirit
I move away hastily

354
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:10,667
The darkness makes the heart grow fonder
Forgive me if you can

355
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:17,958
I hope to see you again
Good night, darling

356
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:24,667
The darkness makes the heart grow fonder
Forgive me if you can

357
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,708
I hope to see you again
Good night, darling

358
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,416
There he is!

359
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:33,042
- Get off the car. Catch him!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

360
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,042
Hey! Stop right there!
Stop!

361
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,125
- Hey! Come here! Stop!
- Where are you going?

362
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,518
- Please, please...
- Running away?

363
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:41,957
- Running away after biting the heroine?
- I'm not running away.

364
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:44,125
- I didn't bite her on purpose.
- Oh you didn't!

365
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:46,457
- I'm sorry. I just want to go home.
- Where do you stay?

366
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,083
- No, I didn't...
- Where is your home?

367
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,916
- Give him a good thrashing.
- He bit her!

368
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,875
- I'll explain...
- Want to be Dracula?

369
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,542
- Beat him up!
- Don't spare him.

370
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,417
- Bloody swine!
- Let's go!

371
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,417
Hey!

372
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,375
Let him be!

373
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Enemies all around...

374
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,875
I'm tired of running.

375
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,708
Can you give me a place to hide, Manjari?

376
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,417
In your house?

377
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:44,625
Light and shadows play freely
in the night

378
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:51,208
The path seems distant
And all travel suspended

379
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:58,208
Light and shadows play freely
in the night

380
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:05,166
The path seems distant
And all travel suspended

381
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:12,667
The siren walks alone
There's silence in applause

382
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:19,375
Endless flowers bloom
in its fear of being extinct

383
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:25,457
I save a million words to describe you

384
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:33,083
I hope to see you again
Good night, darling

385
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:39,499
I save a million words to describe you

386
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,500
I hope to see you again
Good night, darling

387
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,042
Chapter 2
THE SOLDIER IN THE ATTIC

388
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,208
When did the attic come into existence...

389
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
or who discovered it?
I don't know.

390
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:19,250
But people have always used attics...

391
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,000
to hide things.

392
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:27,333
Everything that is old...
Everything that is a secret...

393
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,417
To protect it.

394
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:42,042
An attic in Kolkata in 1970
had to be dug up.

395
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,708
Where light can't penetrate.

396
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,292
I like the darkness, Manjari.

397
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,083
But I think I must leave now.

398
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,208
Where will you go?

399
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,875
Where will you run to?

400
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,792
How far will you run?

401
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:11,458
Our Chairman says
that death is heavy like a mountain.

402
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,667
Sometimes, I wish...

403
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,458
On a full moon night...

404
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,875
to lie under the open sky.

405
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,625
To count stars in the dark.

406
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,958
Fireflies would surround me.

407
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:31,917
After some time, it would be hard to tell
the difference between the stars...

408
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,458
and the fireflies.

409
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,958
My flute has lost it's music.

410
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,500
I had never imagined...

411
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,292
that I'll see you again
in a dark room like this.

412
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,292
I left you.

413
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,958
You didn't leave me.

414
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,667
You were following your dream.

415
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,583
Your dreams were very far away
from me.

416
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,917
How can that be your fault?

417
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:26,000
You still have memories of me.

418
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,667
I've saved you in my memories.

419
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,792
Do you want to see?

420
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,667
I brought you some clothes and...

421
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:59,667
Your late husband's clothes?

422
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:05,000
Let's hope they don't become
dead lover's clothes.

423
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,792
Please don't come to me like this, Manjari.

424
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,792
Leave the food near the stairs.

425
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,833
No need to come to the room.

426
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,833
Two. Three.

427
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,250
Four, five, six.

428
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:47,042
Baranagar, Purulia, Bahrampur, Naxalbari...
is on fire, Manjari.

429
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,250
Everywhere...

430
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,750
I know.

431
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:53,708
I stay up all night counting the shots
and the bombs.

432
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:55,667
I'm keeping an account.

433
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,167
I try to guess
which one was thrown by you.

434
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,750
Or which one hit me in the chest?

435
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,583
What's the point
of keeping count, Manjari?

436
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:10,542
Sooner or later,
the world will want to settle the score.

437
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,375
What if it doesn't?

438
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,083
I'll still keep counting.

439
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:18,125
And I'll feel that I was there with you
and the comrades.

440
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,000
You were there.

441
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,250
What are you doing here?

442
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,208
Just like that.

443
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,042
Me too.

444
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,708
The room stifles me.

445
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,625
Everyone seems very happy today.

446
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,167
Almost like the Kali festival.

447
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,125
Did India win a cricket match?

448
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,750
Aren't you happy?

449
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,958
I don't watch cricket.

450
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh!

451
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,125
Sabita!

452
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,792
Hey, Sabita!

453
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,500
Sabita!

454
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,250
Hey, Sabita!

455
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,792
The most heartfelt love letters
in the world...

456
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,333
were written from the battlefront,
Manjari.

457
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,875
In a trench.

458
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,417
Covered in the smell of gunpowder.

459
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,875
Under the cold shadow of death...

460
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,708
None of them reached me.

461
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:52,333
"This valley of death is not my country...

462
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:56,333
This blood soaked slaughterhouse
is not my country...

463
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,042
This executioner's stage is not my country.

464
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:06,417
This immense graveyard is not my country.

465
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,958
This valley of death is not country."

466
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,125
What kind of a man are you?

467
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,500
Don't you know
why I keeping coming close to you?

468
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,333
What... What are you talking about?

469
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,292
I can't...

470
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:45,708
I can't take it anymore.

471
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,375
What are you doing?

472
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,667
I'm looking for shelter.

473
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,750
I want to spend my life with you.

474
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,875
Will you give me asylum?

475
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:57,125
Please don't push me away.

476
00:36:57,167 --> 00:37:00,291
Please let go of me.
Please leave me.

477
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,809
What are you doing?
Please don't do this to me.

478
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,125
See...

479
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,667
The man that I am with right now
is no one to me.

480
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,542
He doesn't mean anything.

481
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,417
Every night...

482
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,917
is like a nightmare.

483
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,499
Let's run away, Raktim.
Together...

484
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,916
- Actually, my job...
- It's better to die than live like this.

485
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,625
I don't want any money.

486
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:27,958
I just need a human being.

487
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:31,625
You can't hide me here forever, Manjari.

488
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:37,667
You're national enemy if you do.

489
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll not let you go anywhere, Amol.

490
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,625
I'll get comfortable
if I stay with you here.

491
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:45,000
Is that why I'm not allowed
inside the room?

492
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,500
You're scared
that you'll be happy with me?

493
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:50,542
This is not happiness, Manjari.
This is compromise.

494
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:54,042
This is not the time for the moon,
stars or fireflies.

495
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:59,208
Please don't misunderstand me.
I'm an ordinary man.

496
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,750
Why would I misunderstand you?

497
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,458
It's my fault.

498
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,750
I'm a widow with a small child.

499
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,708
Your revolution has made you very lonely.

500
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,917
Just like you had left me alone.

501
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,083
Why would you take my responsibility?

502
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:37,000
After you get a permanent job,
there'd be many suitors.

503
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,499
There would be no dearth
of loved ones, then.

504
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,958
- No, no...
- Keep quiet.

505
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:44,042
I've figured you out.

506
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:49,083
You wanted to stay here for less rent
by scaring a kid.

507
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,708
Go on...

508
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,292
You think I don't know
how spineless you are?

509
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,708
Live the rest of your life like a worm.

510
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,208
Anyway, no one will come close
because of those teeth.

511
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,250
Fear...

512
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:30,500
Fear is like a lane.

513
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,417
Whose walls are marked with revolution.

514
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,916
COMRADE
PICK UP THE RIFLE

515
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,125
NAXALBARI WAY
IS OUR WAY

516
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,375
And conspiracy floats in the air.

517
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,083
Do you believe in rebirth?

518
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,458
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

519
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,417
I mean... Hey!

520
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,707
- Bloody idiot!
- Born again?

521
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,417
Who did Vidyasagar reborn as?

522
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:57,708
You know sometimes I think...

523
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:02,542
That I was Vidyasagar in my last birth.

524
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,958
What are you saying, Katu?

525
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:15,083
Not "Borno Porichoy",
the introduction to alphabets...

526
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,417
His real work was saving widows...

527
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:24,208
Do you know how many widows
there are in our neighbourhood?

528
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,750
- Huh?
- No.

529
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:29,417
Three and a half.
How many?

530
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,458
Three and a half.

531
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:34,500
- Why three and a half?
- This man knows everything.

532
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,750
- What?
- Why three and a half?

533
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:40,000
There were three widows.

534
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:43,000
I've rescued them.

535
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:47,458
There's half left.
Manjari.

536
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,417
Manjari.

537
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,750
But why half?

538
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,625
Why half?

539
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,292
Why half?

540
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,250
I had gone far away from you, Amol.

541
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,250
Why did you come back?

542
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:11,000
Why did you bring back the memories?

543
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:16,957
I know you'll be hurt

544
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:24,667
But I can't accept the pride
hidden in your lips

545
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,541
I know you'll feel like crying

546
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:36,542
Our tombstone will be a witness
to our distance

547
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,083
I know you'll be hurt

548
00:41:55,292 --> 00:42:02,833
But I can't accept the pride
hidden in your lips

549
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,625
I know you'll feel like crying

550
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:14,042
Our tombstone will be a witness
to our distance

551
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:21,500
I will be born again

552
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:29,583
I'll be the last to come home
Your time traveller

553
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:36,792
I will be born again

554
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:44,542
My face might change
But you'll know my voice

555
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:50,875
You can call me sorrow then

556
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:59,292
Let me be your sorrow then

557
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:04,875
You can call me sorrow then

558
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,083
MAHESHWAR HIGH SCHOOL
HOOGHLY ESTD 1970

559
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:15,333
Why do you want to be my sorrow?

560
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,292
There you are.

561
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:27,583
I was waiting for you.

562
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:30,000
Do you know what a huge loss
they've suffered?

563
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,542
Their shoot has stopped.

564
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,750
Any idea how much money they've lost?

565
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,750
They could have handed you over
to the police.

566
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,833
Who, in their right mind,
would actually bite?

567
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,875
It was meant to be acting.

568
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,542
You just bit her?

569
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,374
How can you bite the heroine?
Horrible!

570
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,125
I made a huge mistake, sir.

571
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,875
And your sorry is meant to pardon
seven murders?

572
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:53,125
You think this is the school
that will do whatever you want?

573
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:55,375
And everyone will tolerate you?

574
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,458
- Sir, I didn't so it on purpose.
- Let it be.

575
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,250
I've understood your scope.

576
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,500
You are very dangerous.

577
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:04,167
How can I retain you in a school
full of kids?

578
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,792
Sir, I love kids.

579
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,226
And you'll bite them if you don't, huh?

580
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,000
Sir, I'll beg for their forgiveness.

581
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,250
Who will you say sorry to?

582
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,875
The trustee board
doesn't want to retain you.

583
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,875
You've brought dishonour
and shame to the entire school.

584
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,124
Disgusting!

585
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,458
Here's the letter.

586
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,958
Take it!

587
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:27,625
You don't have to come here anymore.
You can settle your accounts another day.

588
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:31,083
Sir, sir... Please don't do this... Please.

589
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:36,708
- Please don't do this to me, sir.
- Why? You didn't think of it while biting?

590
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:40,083
Please go and live in a zoo.
Okay?

591
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,708
You shouldn't be allowed
in the civilized society.

592
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,832
Why don't you join a circus?

593
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,000
- Sir, please... Sir...
- Get lost!

594
00:44:54,375 --> 00:45:01,958
All the broken boats
They are never going to sail again

595
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:08,042
Memories are ancient

596
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:13,458
Your image becomes clear

597
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,374
You are a painful fiction

598
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:22,958
Just like the pain you suffer

599
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:31,000
All the broken boats
They are never going to sail again

600
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:39,375
Memories are ancient

601
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:47,125
I will be born again

602
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:55,208
I'll build you your playhouse

603
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:02,417
I will be born again

604
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:06,542
My face might change
But you'll know my voice

605
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:09,708
NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY DEATH
RAKTIM CHOWDHURY

606
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:17,208
You can call me sorrow then

607
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:24,583
Let me be your sorrow then

608
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:32,874
You can call me sorrow then

609
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:40,875
Why do you want to be my sorrow?

610
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,458
Sometimes I feel like...

611
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:50,583
To stand under the full moon night sky...

612
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,583
and count stars in the darkness.

613
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:58,125
Fireflies will surround me.

614
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,875
After sometime, it'd difficult to tell
the difference...

615
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:06,500
between the stars and the fireflies.

616
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:13,708
Manjari!

617
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:20,208
Are you trying to run away again, Amol?

618
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,583
How many times will you try to escape?

619
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,542
Don't leave, Amol.

620
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:45,167
CHAPTER 3
KOLKATA'S DRACULA

621
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,792
Bang! Bang!

622
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,667
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!

623
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:50,708
Bang! Bang!

624
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,917
- Hey, stop it!
- Bang! Bang!

625
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,417
Hey! I said stop it!
- Bang! Bang!

626
00:48:56,958 --> 00:49:00,125
Go and play on the terrace.

627
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:04,292
- Mom will come with me.
- No one will go with you.

628
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:05,625
You'll go alone.

629
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:08,083
Have I kept your mom
to only play with you?

630
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,500
You hurt my mom!
Bang! Bang!

631
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:13,792
- Bang! Bang!
- Wait you little imp!

632
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:15,917
- I'll get you!
- Bang! Bang!

633
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,226
- You bastard!
- What's going on?

634
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,958
- I'll slap you hard!
- Bang! Bang!

635
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,125
Let him be.

636
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,148
He's just a kid.

637
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:24,750
Oh really!

638
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:27,165
- He's not a kid!
- Bultai...

639
00:49:27,243 --> 00:49:30,753
- I'll drop him in the water tank below.
- Go play on the terrace.

640
00:49:30,878 --> 00:49:32,213
Look at him wasting water.

641
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:34,581
Hey, Dracula sir!

642
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:36,346
Just wait and watch
what I do to you.

643
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:37,583
Excuse me.

644
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,583
Raktim!

645
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:41,771
- Please come upstairs.
- Mom.

646
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:44,208
- This will teach you a lesson.
- Mom.

647
00:49:45,044 --> 00:49:47,417
Come as you are.

648
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:48,769
- Come fast.
- He's calling him again.

649
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:50,292
You're completely out of control.

650
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,542
Just wait.

651
00:49:51,752 --> 00:49:53,250
Now, you'll know.

652
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,708
Now see who's here.

653
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,917
Why are you hiding now?

654
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,541
Please let him go.

655
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:09,458
Just shut up, b♪♪♪h!
Move out of the way.

656
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:12,750
- Shut him in the room inside.
- Mom.

657
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:17,000
Just show him
what a scary monster you are.

658
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:20,542
He's out of control. Bastard!

659
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,875
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Forget about your mom!

660
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,749
- Let me go!
- Take him away!

661
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,625
Let go of me!
Mom!

662
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:44,833
- Yes, take him away!
- Mom! Mom!

663
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,542
- Lock him up!
- Let me go!

664
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:49,292
- Scare him properly!
- Please let me go.

665
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,250
Let me go.

666
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:54,667
I'm scared...

667
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,292
Mom! Mom!

668
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:04,000
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Feeling scared...

669
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:08,125
- Open the door!
- If he's scared properly, he'll calm down.

670
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:12,582
- I'm scared, Mom.
- Your job is done. Leave.

671
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,833
- I'm feeling afraid, Mom.
- Go!

672
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:20,333
- Hey! I'm asking you to leave!
- I'm scared, Mom.

673
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:22,583
Please let me go...

674
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,417
Come.

675
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:26,875
- Come.
- Let me go.

676
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,792
- Let me go.
- Open the door.

677
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,518
- Please not today.
- You have to come, b♪♪♪h!

678
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:32,208
- I beg you, please let me go!
- Mom!

679
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:35,707
- Please let me go.
- Come with me. Rubbish!

680
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:38,333
- Mom!
- Let me go!

681
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:41,917
- Let go of me. Not today...
- Shut up and come with me.

682
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,917
- Leave me alone!
- Mom...

683
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:53,583
- "Let's all go to the lotus pond, my beloved".
- Mom, please. Mom.

684
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:56,208
Open the door!

685
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:59,958
- Let's go the garden...
- Mom!

686
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:07,667
- "Let's all go to the lotus pond, my beloved".
- Mom, I'm scared, please...

687
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,708
I'm scared, Mom.

688
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,125
- This perfume is from Varanasi.
- Mom! Mom!

689
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:17,500
- This is the only interest I have in life.
- Mom! Please...

690
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:18,707
Open the door, please.

691
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:23,667
- "Let's all go, my beloved".
- Please open the door. Mom!

692
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:25,541
Comrade...

693
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:26,542
Pick up the rifle!

694
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:28,625
Mom!

695
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,416
Spread the revolution far and wide!

696
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:34,208
"All my life...

697
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:40,457
"Let's all go to the lotus pond,
my beloved".

698
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:46,375
"Let's all go to the lotus pond,
my beloved".

699
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:52,000
"In the cool breeze...
All my life..."

700
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:59,417
"Let's all go to the lotus pond,
my beloved".

701
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:07,917
"In the cool breeze...
All my life..."

702
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,958
"Let's all go to the lotus pond,
my beloved".

703
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,625
Lie down.

704
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:18,958
(humming)

705
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,625
Take it.

706
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:43,458
When the moon sets
When the night ends

707
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:46,874
The blind stars return home

708
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,042
What is this?

709
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:49,458
You?

710
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:51,333
Go on!

711
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:54,833
Finish off the class enemies.

712
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:57,042
Hey!

713
00:53:57,542 --> 00:54:00,083
Bloody swine!

714
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:01,875
Hey!

715
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,333
How dare you come into the room?

716
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,583
I'll throw you out!

717
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,833
The barrel of the gun
is the source of power.

718
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,749
Hey, hey!
How can you touch me?

719
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,333
What's the matter with you?
Hey! Hey!

720
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,124
It's still dark outside

721
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:31,875
Covers of magazines at night

722
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:39,417
Hundreds of whales being hunted
in a universal funeral

723
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:47,292
Time keeps flowing
You get along with anger

724
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:55,250
A thousand years spent in the attic

725
00:54:55,292 --> 00:55:03,082
Time keeps flowing
You get along with anger

726
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:08,000
A thousand years spent in the attic

727
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:11,292
I wanted to drown, Manjari.

728
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:19,250
Why did you stop me?

729
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:27,375
Everything is forgotten

730
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,791
Dracula sits by himself.

731
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:37,667
KOLKTA'S DRACULA
HARIDAS BANDOPADHYAY

732
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,792
He doesn't have any friends.

733
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:48,542
The clock on the GPO
strikes 12 at night.

734
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,333
It starts snowing...

735
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:56,375
It starts snowing in Kolkata.

736
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:16,333
The lonely monster won't return home

737
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:20,458
The dark night can't hold him back

738
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:27,208
Pillows will burst open to cover
the icy city with ash

739
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:35,083
Time keeps flowing
You get along with anger

740
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:43,125
A thousand years spent in the attic

741
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:51,250
Burnt lips and erased pain

742
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:59,333
The lonely monster looks for his home

743
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:03,333
Everything is forgotten

744
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:07,333
Everything is forgotten

745
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,542
Everything is forgotten

746
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:18,958
Everything is forgotten

747
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:21,792
The winter of 1971...

748
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:26,625
It snowed for the last time
in Kolkata.

749
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,750
What's all this?

750
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,417
What have you done to the place?

751
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,582
Why have you kept all the windows shut?

752
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,375
Don't open it! Don't open it!
Don't open it!

753
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:48,958
Don't open it! Don't open it!

754
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:54,750
I know why you did it.

755
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:59,333
I didn't want so much from you.

756
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:01,917
Bhuvan suffered a heart attack.

757
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:03,333
He's in coma since last night.

758
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:06,375
If he regains consciousness
he'll tell everyone.

759
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:12,042
I suggest you...
leave this place for some time.

760
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,958
Where... Where will I go?

761
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,417
To some friends or family, maybe?

762
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,875
I have no one.

763
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:23,458
Everyone is scared of me.

764
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,167
Everyone is...

765
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,542
What's wrong with you?

766
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,000
Oh my God!

767
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:31,625
You're burning up with fever.

768
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:34,708
- I'll get you some medicines.
- No, no, I don't need it.

769
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,458
Please leave...
I don't need anything.

770
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:40,625
What's wrong?
What happened to you, Raktim?

771
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:41,832
Tell me...

772
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,375
Please leave!

773
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,875
I'm going.

774
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:56,417
You'll be in trouble if you stay here.

775
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:17,208
CHAPTER 4
KOLKATA 71

776
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:23,917
"Let's all go to the lotus pond,
my beloved".

777
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:29,833
"Let's all go to the lotus pond,
my beloved".

778
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,707
Boss, that's exactly like Rajesh Khanna.

779
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:35,167
Oh come on!
Not completely.

780
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,250
A little.

781
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,250
What do you think of this fragrance?

782
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:45,250
I swear, boss. It's amazing!

783
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:48,042
You have a great collection!

784
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,792
I got it from Varanasi.

785
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:53,583
- Varanasi.
- Yeah

786
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:57,167
This fragrance will bring her out.

787
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:00,667
Oh! Boss, when will she come?

788
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:04,791
The fragrance will waft through the air.
Let it reach her.

789
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:09,833
Such a huge house, so many rooms...
A lonely young widow.

790
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:12,833
Maybe, she loses her way.

791
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:17,667
I can't see her despair anymore, Nata.

792
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,875
I have to do something about it.

793
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,292
I've to take her responsibility, you know.
Responsibility...

794
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:28,934
Three rounds of shots were fired
at the student's protest in Kolkata...

795
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,125
claims the police super.

796
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:34,042
The number of casualties is three...

797
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:47,000
I'll not let you go to war again, Amol.

798
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,875
Absolutely not.

799
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,875
I'll hide you with me forever.

800
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:43,917
You see, Katu...

801
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:47,250
there are strange noises
coming from the house.

802
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,958
I've told you
there are ghosts in the house

803
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,167
Hey!

804
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,500
There's a living ghost in the house.

805
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,583
A living ghost.

806
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,833
When the flute stops playing in tune...

807
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:39,917
It's a sign of impending danger.

808
01:02:40,292 --> 01:02:43,792
You can only belt out heavy dialogues
sitting here.

809
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:46,500
The most you'll go is till the door.

810
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:49,417
You won't be able to enter the house.

811
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:51,667
I'll go in.

812
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,792
I'll enter.

813
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:58,292
If she doesn't come down
looking for the scent...

814
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:03,333
Then the scent will reach her
where she is.

815
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:04,917
Amol, open the door.

816
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,125
You can't escape.
We've surrounded you, Amol!

817
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,208
Amol, open the door!

818
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:17,750
Just wait and watch
what we do to you at the station.

819
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:20,125
Hey, you bloody swine, Amol!

820
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,792
Amol is not here.

821
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:25,583
Please leave.

822
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:31,542
Amol is not here.
Please leave.

823
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:48,792
"Let the 70's be the decade of freedom."

824
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:54,124
Armed rebellion is the only way.

825
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,500
Down with imperialism!

826
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,957
Amol! Amol, what are you doing?

827
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,792
- Leave it.
- Leave me alone.

828
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:04,582
I have to practice.

829
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:07,083
When they arrest me
I'll have to endure their torture.

830
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,333
Have you lost your mind, Amol?

831
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,041
Armed rebellion is our only way.

832
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:13,375
You were right, Manjari.
I'm very selfish.

833
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:15,167
I only think about myself.

834
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,125
Wait here.
I'll clean you up.

835
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:18,624
- Sit.
- No, no!

836
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:21,832
You've judged me wrong, Manjari.

837
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:24,125
I'm a failed, injured soldier.

838
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:25,541
I'm hiding
because I don't want to get caught.

839
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:26,976
- No, Amol, you're not..
- And where am I hiding?

840
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,416
At my ex-lover's home.

841
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:32,625
I am a..
I am a bourgeoisie...

842
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:34,500
- I should be punished...
- No, Amol.

843
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:38,791
Manjari, Comrade Charu Majumdar.
They've killed him.

844
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,958
They'll kill me too.

845
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,374
- They won't spare anyone.
- Nothing will happen to you.

846
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:44,167
I won't let anything happen to you.

847
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:49,083
When they'll scoop out my flesh
I'll probably blurt out the names.

848
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:51,707
I'm not Rono. I'm not Dipen.
I'm not Atishi.

849
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:54,416
- I don't have their courage...
- Nothing will happen to you...

850
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:56,750
I have to...
I have to practice, Manjari...

851
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:59,000
- I have to practice.
- Amol!

852
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,666
Tell us who else was there.

853
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:03,917
You won't say it, right?

854
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,208
You won't?

855
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:18,250
- Why are you doing this...
- I'll tell them the names, Manjari.

856
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,875
Nothing will happen, Amol.

857
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,750
Amol, please calm down.

858
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:36,792
I can't go on living the life of
a failed revolutionary, Manjari.

859
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:40,333
The gun doesn't look good on you.

860
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,250
It doesn't suit you.

861
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,250
Your hands deserve the flute.

862
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:50,000
I know you'll be hurt

863
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:57,750
But I can't accept the pride
hidden in your lips

864
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:01,458
I know you'll feel like crying

865
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:08,958
Our tombstone will be a witness
to our distance

866
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:27,958
I know you'll be hurt

867
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:35,750
But I can't accept the pride
hidden in your lips

868
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:39,625
I know you'll feel like crying

869
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:47,333
Our tombstone will be a witness
to our distance

870
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:53,542
I will be born again

871
01:06:54,833 --> 01:07:02,625
I'll be the last to come home
Your time traveller

872
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,917
I will be born again

873
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:17,542
My face might change
But you'll know my voice

874
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:24,208
You can call me sorrow then

875
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:31,917
Let me be your sorrow then

876
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:40,250
You can call me sorrow then

877
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:48,167
Why do you want to be my sorrow?

878
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:49,167
Bhuvan, can you hear me?

879
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,625
I've made a huge mistake.

880
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:58,500
I've come to say sorry.

881
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:06,042
I'll never...
No, no no...

882
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:09,208
- Amol...
- No, no, no...

883
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:13,500
Please forgive me.

884
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:18,917
Please forgive me.

885
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:48,708
Don't you want to hear
the rest of the story, Amol?

886
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,708
I want to, Manjari.

887
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,625
Actually, I was really thirsty.

888
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:59,000
That's why...
That's why...

889
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,750
Have I really turned into a vampire,
Manjari?

890
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,958
A real life Dracula sir?

891
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,167
I don't know what you are, Amol.

892
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:21,708
I only know...

893
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,208
You don't have any weapon in this life.

894
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:28,958
No rifles.

895
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,417
No cartridges.

896
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,875
No pistols.

897
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:37,250
You just have your two special teeth.

898
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:41,667
That's your weapon, Amol.

899
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,458
Don't compromise.

900
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,042
Don't be comfortable.

901
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:54,042
Identify your enemies.

902
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:57,417
Mark them.

903
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,708
Finish them.

904
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:10,542
Here you are.

905
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:15,124
I just wanted to let you know
the door is open...

906
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:17,458
I'll shut the door.
You may leave now.

907
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,542
Are you annoyed?

908
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:22,042
These are really disturbing times.

909
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:25,958
People are dying in the neighbourhood.
Bomb blasts every day.

910
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,125
The police are always patrolling.

911
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:31,000
I just wanted to warn you.

912
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:39,000
Can I have some of that water?

913
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:41,625
Please leave.

914
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,042
- Oh!
- Yes.

915
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,917
And yes...

916
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:54,000
The nuisance that goes on
in that broken car in my courtyard...

917
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:56,750
if they don't stop soon...

918
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,917
I'll have to take some strong steps.

919
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:06,375
I'll tell Nata.

920
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:11,000
Goodbye.

921
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:15,125
I asked for water.
I didn't get it.

922
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:18,042
I am leaving with thirst.

923
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:20,958
I might have to come back.

924
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,708
I'll leave now.

925
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,333
(humming)

926
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:38,542
I know what happened after that, Manjari...

927
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:44,583
You took my gun to scare Katu away.

928
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:50,083
But the wreath Katu got for me that day...

929
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,417
He didn't have the courage
to give that to me.

930
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:58,375
Bloody coward, Katu!

931
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,042
What are you doing here?

932
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:23,542
I was waiting for you, Manjari.

933
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,542
I came to give you this.

934
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:31,375
All the florists are closed today
in the city.

935
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,125
Only flowers of mourning everywhere.

936
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:37,083
But at least they are flowers.

937
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:40,583
That's why I brought
in case you needed them.

938
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:42,708
Why would I need flowers?

939
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:45,458
To mourn the person
whose clothes you hang to dry.

940
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,042
Please give it to him.

941
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,458
Please take it.

942
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:49,917
Oh no!

943
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:55,500
KATU+
MAN

944
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:57,500
Those are my husband's clothes.

945
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,708
I had taken them out for a wash.

946
01:15:02,042 --> 01:15:06,708
- But should I give you any explanation?
- Why should you?

947
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:15,208
They are your husband's clothes.
You can do whatever you want with them.

948
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:21,042
Just put this wreath on him...

949
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,667
- Let go of me! Let me go!
- Manjari!

950
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,208
KATU+
MANJARI

951
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:35,917
Manjari, now you have to decide
if you want live with a dead man or me.

952
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,875
You have to decide if you want to
dry a dead man's clothes or be with me.

953
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:42,625
Don't come closer.
I'm warning you.

954
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:47,958
If Katu Mallick has decided to give flowers
to someone, he will.

955
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:50,333
His words have some value.

956
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:51,958
Please accept these.

957
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,792
Did you just hit me, Manjari?

958
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:01,417
So much anger?

959
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,250
Manju... Manju...

960
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:05,583
Manjari, that's a gun.
Give it to me.

961
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:08,332
No, don't do it.
Manjari, give me the gun.

962
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,208
Power lies in the barrel of the gun.

963
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,458
Manjari...

964
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:14,125
The barrel of the gun
is the source of power.

965
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,583
NATA+
MANJARI

966
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,292
Manjari...

967
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,917
What have you done, Manjari?

968
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:28,417
What did you do...

969
01:16:33,083 --> 01:16:34,250
Manjari!

970
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,625
Where are you going, Manjari?

971
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:37,958
Manjari!

972
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:40,208
- Manjari, open the door.
- What happened?

973
01:16:40,292 --> 01:16:42,833
- Get ready. You have to leave right now.
- Manjari!

974
01:16:43,167 --> 01:16:43,833
Why?

975
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:46,375
You wanted to leave anyway.

976
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:51,917
Between love and revolution,
revolution is your priority.

977
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:55,583
If you stay here you'll become lazy
and comfortable.

978
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,250
You'll be an anti-revolutionary.

979
01:16:58,792 --> 01:17:00,792
What are you waiting for?
Get ready.

980
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,333
- You're hiding something from me.
- Manjari!

981
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,292
- What's going on in this house?
- Manjari!

982
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,583
- They have...
- Open the door!

983
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:09,792
Seen you, Amol.

984
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,917
- Manjari!
- You have to leave right now.

985
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:18,125
You're not safe here anymore.

986
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,375
Nata!

987
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,833
Somebody open the door.

988
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:30,750
I've wasted a bullet.

989
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,417
The rest of them are there.

990
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,458
Go on!

991
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,500
Kill the class enemies.

992
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:41,500
Your fight is outside.

993
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,292
Your war is outside, Amol.

994
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,042
In the world.

995
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,542
Bloody!

996
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:15,958
Manjari!

997
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,750
Manjari!

998
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:42,292
A modern Krishna!

999
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:44,208
Bloody Naxal!

1000
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:46,417
I won't spare you!

1001
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,958
I'm not going to spare you.

1002
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:49,042
Hey!

1003
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,542
Hey!

1004
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:55,083
Manjari...

1005
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:57,125
Manjari...

1006
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:10,958
Naxalbari's red fire is burning bright!
Burning bright!

1007
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:14,750
The martyr's blood...

1008
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,250
You haven't seen me as a bride, Amol.

1009
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:19,499
Naxalbari's red fire is burning bright!
Burning bright!

1010
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,333
Dressed in gold...

1011
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:24,417
- The martyrs blood was shed...
- Not be in vain.

1012
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:26,999
Naxalbari's red fire is burning bright!
Burning bright!

1013
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,167
Can't I join your movement?

1014
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:30,708
You won't be able to do it, Manjari.

1015
01:19:30,792 --> 01:19:33,667
Chairman calls it death
as heavy as the mountain.

1016
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:36,624
- Naxalbari is up in arms.
- Down with capitalism!

1017
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:39,708
You think I won't be able to accept
death as heavy as a mountain?

1018
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:40,917
Have you gone crazy?

1019
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:43,666
Stop dreaming, Manjari.

1020
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:44,833
Naxalbari is up in arms...

1021
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:47,083
Who is dreaming, Amol?

1022
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,332
Me or you?

1023
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:58,333
- Your name, my name.
- Vietnam! Vietnam!

1024
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:08,667
Naxalbari's red fire is burning bright!
Burning bright!

1025
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:16,917
Naxalbari's red fire is burning bright!
Burning bright!

1026
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:26,417
Down with imperialism!

1027
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:29,875
Long live revolution!

1028
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:34,083
Let the '70s be the decade of freedom.

1029
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:47,083
Down with imperialism!

1030
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,708
Long live revolution!

1031
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:53,708
Let the '70s be the decade of freedom.

1032
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:55,750
Vietnam...

1033
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:57,750
Bangladesh...

1034
01:20:57,792 --> 01:21:00,958
Cambodia, India...
They are all on fire, Manjari.

1035
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:05,458
You didn't believe me.

1036
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:09,458
But I've learnt all your slogans.

1037
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,667
Look at these.

1038
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:15,000
These are my wedding jewellery.

1039
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:18,708
You wanted me to have a comfortable life.

1040
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:22,625
- Manjari, I...
- You should go away from here, Amol.

1041
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:26,042
Leave before they find you here.

1042
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:31,125
Let my comfort be with me.

1043
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,167
Will you wait for me?

1044
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:39,000
Long live your revolution, Amol!

1045
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,167
Tear gas...

1046
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:52,208
What a beautiful name!

1047
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:57,375
It'll make you cry
even if you don't want to.

1048
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:17,292
Nata!

1049
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,208
Katu, where are you going?

1050
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:27,250
Listen to me.
Don't act crazy.

1051
01:22:28,917 --> 01:22:30,000
Leave me alone.

1052
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:33,792
Katu...

1053
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:37,958
Did you see with your own eyes?

1054
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:40,125
- No, I mean...
- Tell me the truth.

1055
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:41,167
Katu...

1056
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:42,792
Tell me the truth.

1057
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:48,417
It was quite intense.
They were kissing and making out.

1058
01:22:57,792 --> 01:22:59,500
What are you doing?

1059
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:02,500
Police! Oh police!

1060
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:07,958
Before you meet Katu,
take off your hat.

1061
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:14,625
Chairman said death as heavy as
the mountain awaits.

1062
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:19,417
I can see that mountain-like death,
Manjari.

1063
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:25,417
Raktim!

1064
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,458
Raktim!

1065
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:33,250
He has not opened the door
for the last two days.

1066
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,208
Sabita, call the neighbours.

1067
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:38,000
Bultai! Hey, Bultai!

1068
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,208
Come here.

1069
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:42,667
- Hurry up.
- What happened, Mom?

1070
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,875
- Go and get some people.
- Okay.

1071
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,792
Sir! Raktim!

1072
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:58,417
- What happened?
- This won't work.

1073
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:01,167
- I think we have to open the door.
- Yes, break the door.

1074
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,625
You can't open it with your hands.
Use your shoulder.

1075
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:27,958
I am a threat to the nation.

1076
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:31,583
Because I keep talking about freedom.

1077
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,917
And I will... every time I come back.

1078
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:51,499
Mom, why is the police taking him away?

1079
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,500
Keep quiet.

1080
01:24:57,542 --> 01:25:00,583
Don't worry.
He's not a criminal.

1081
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:03,750
The police have taken him
for questioning.

1082
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:05,999
- What happened to him?
- Take care.

1083
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,708
(indistinct chatter)

1084
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,542
CHAPTER 5
DEATH AS HEAVY AS MOUNTAIN

1085
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:30,625
Our very own Che Guevara!

1086
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,500
F♪♪king revolutionary!
Huh?

1087
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:35,958
- Who else was there?
- Amol.

1088
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,125
- Come on, tell me.
- Amol!

1089
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:40,750
- Cat got your tongue?
- Where is he?

1090
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:44,250
Manjari, oh Manjari!
Beautiful Manjari!

1091
01:25:44,292 --> 01:25:49,458
Why is your heart crest fallen today?

1092
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:50,833
Amol!

1093
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:56,083
According to you people Rabindranath Tagore
is a bourgeoisie poet.

1094
01:25:56,458 --> 01:25:57,958
I've heard you are a widow.

1095
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Which classless society were you going
towards dressed up as a bride, Manjari?

1096
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:10,875
I've sent for hot boiled eggs.

1097
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,707
Hard boiled.

1098
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:19,749
If fitted in the right place,
words will come out involuntarily.

1099
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,167
- Spit it out!
- No.

1100
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:23,583
- I'll skin you alive, you swine.
- Amol, no...

1101
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:28,875
You can't...
No one can endure this torture.

1102
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,583
What is it, you pig?
Huh?

1103
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,083
You’re not going to talk, huh?

1104
01:26:34,292 --> 01:26:37,917
You people have turned the state
into a pig sty.

1105
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,500
- It was needed...
- What did you say?

1106
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:42,208
- It was needed...
- Speak up!

1107
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:45,292
For pigs like you...

1108
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:48,000
this pig sty was a necessity.

1109
01:26:49,208 --> 01:26:50,875
You find it funny?

1110
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,250
Someone get me the pliers.

1111
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,458
Let me warm up my hands.

1112
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:02,583
Your neck is looking very bare.

1113
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:07,500
Let me put this necklace around it.

1114
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:13,042
You have to talk now.

1115
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:17,041
How many people were you harboring
in your house, Manjari?

1116
01:27:17,042 --> 01:27:19,333
How many fugitives?
Tell me.

1117
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:21,667
Alright!

1118
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:23,667
Let me see.

1119
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,250
Open your mouth.

1120
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,208
Open it.

1121
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,542
Do you want some water?

1122
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:31,625
I've got some water for you.

1123
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:33,208
Open your mouth.

1124
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,083
Here you are...

1125
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:39,125
Easy... Don't shout... No...

1126
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:49,917
Will you tell me or not?

1127
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:53,125
The sooner you tell me...

1128
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,000
the sooner I can leave for home.

1129
01:27:56,167 --> 01:28:00,000
I have to listen to some music.

1130
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:05,250
How much darkness can I carry around?

1131
01:28:05,292 --> 01:28:09,125
I have to turn white...
White!

1132
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:11,792
I'll pull out your teeth!

1133
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,583
Now show me your teeth.

1134
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:16,625
Here... I have taken it out.

1135
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,708
See it for yourself.

1136
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,042
See...

1137
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,042
Here you go.

1138
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:30,458
Let's go.

1139
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:32,708
You have been released.

1140
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,500
Let's go.

1141
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,542
Bloody swine.

1142
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,000
Amol...

1143
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,542
Amol...

1144
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:49,750
It's burnt...

1145
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,250
Amol...

1146
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:54,375
- Who?
- Amol.

1147
01:28:55,042 --> 01:28:56,499
- Amol...
- Amol?

1148
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,208
Who Amol?
Amol is dead.

1149
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,792
Amol is dead.

1150
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:07,375
They had taken me away like this
that day.

1151
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:19,750
- What? You don't believe me?
- You're lying.

1152
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:24,917
- You're lying... Amol...
- Someone bring it in.

1153
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:28,333
Nineteen seventy one.

1154
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:31,917
A winter morning in Kolkata.

1155
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:33,500
Here you go.

1156
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:36,250
Can you recognise this?

1157
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:38,958
This is your Amol's blood.
Take a look.

1158
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:41,583
Amol's blood!

1159
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,583
I was feeling scared.

1160
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,208
I was thinking...

1161
01:29:47,792 --> 01:29:51,042
How do we still remember everything
after we die?

1162
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:12,625
CHAPTER 6
I WILL BE BORN AGAIN...

1163
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:16,833
Excuse me.

1164
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:20,208
I'm talking to you.
Can you hear me?

1165
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:23,292
What is your name?

1166
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:25,833
What is your name?

1167
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:28,833
Amol Shom.

1168
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:32,208
But the prescription says
it is Raktim Chowdhury.

1169
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,750
It's yours, right?

1170
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:35,458
Raktim is dead.

1171
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:37,125
Who killed him?
I mean...

1172
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:39,917
How was he killed?
Or how did he die?

1173
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:43,333
Amol Shom killed him.

1174
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:44,958
Why?

1175
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:51,167
Because Amol needs to stay alive
for a few more days.

1176
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,958
Raktim let Amol kill him?

1177
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,292
He didn't say anything to Amol?

1178
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
He wanted to help.

1179
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:02,208
Who was Amol helping?

1180
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:09,042
Come on, tell us.

1181
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:11,583
Who was Amol trying to help?

1182
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,750
Hello! I'm talking to you.

1183
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:21,458
Who are you talking to?

1184
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:22,333
Hmm?

1185
01:31:22,334 --> 01:31:24,208
Who are you talking to?

1186
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:26,583
Is there anyone else in this room
except for us?

1187
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:29,917
There are lots of people to talk to.

1188
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:34,083
Acute schizophrenia.

1189
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:36,999
But sir, there are other things
that are bothering him too.

1190
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Hmm...

1191
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:42,167
You just said
there are other people in the room.

1192
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:43,875
Is it one person or many people?

1193
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,375
You don't want to tell us?

1194
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:51,458
I'll tell you something.

1195
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,167
Amol Shom has passed away.
1972.

1196
01:31:55,417 --> 01:31:58,458
I think this is your imagination.

1197
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:00,625
Amol Shom doesn't exist.

1198
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:04,999
You... You're lying.

1199
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,457
I'm Amol Shom.
My name is Amol Shom.

1200
01:32:07,458 --> 01:32:08,917
Manjari said I'm Amol Shom.

1201
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:10,958
- Who is Manjari?
- Huh?

1202
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:12,750
Who is Manjari?

1203
01:32:12,792 --> 01:32:14,167
My...

1204
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,500
college friend.

1205
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:18,375
From the present or from the '70s?

1206
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,000
Did you love her?

1207
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,583
A lot.

1208
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:27,958
You loved her a lot?

1209
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:30,833
Who told you? Manjari?

1210
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:33,457
Amol knew.

1211
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:35,332
How did he know?
While shooting?

1212
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:37,208
Yes... shooting.

1213
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:40,917
Shooting... yes...
Because I have big teeth...

1214
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,708
That's why they dressed up
as Dracula for the shoot.

1215
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:45,832
Who did they dress up as Dracula?

1216
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:48,125
- Amol or Raktim?
- Me! Me!

1217
01:32:48,167 --> 01:32:51,167
And who is the "me"
you're talking about?

1218
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:54,750
After dressing up as Dracula,
who was that?

1219
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,792
Who changed?
Raktim or Amol?

1220
01:33:02,792 --> 01:33:05,332
There's no one called Manjari.
There's no Amol either.

1221
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:08,082
There's no Nata or Katu.
It's all your imagination.

1222
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,042
Oh, really! Huh?

1223
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:13,124
You haven't seen the memorial
at the school?

1224
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:16,083
The plaque reads Amol Shom.

1225
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:19,583
Whose school is it?
Raktim or Amol?

1226
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,958
You're making fun of me?

1227
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,708
You're kidding with me?

1228
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:29,750
You work for them.

1229
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:30,875
Who "them"?

1230
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:37,583
They shot down so many young people
with dreams. You belong to that group.

1231
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,625
We found a video on your phone.

1232
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,499
A shark being hunted in the sea.

1233
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,624
Yes, I watched it a lot.

1234
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,749
I used to love watching it.

1235
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,667
A few people hunting a shark
from a ship.

1236
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:51,042
Okay.

1237
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:55,000
- Is your observation report ready?
- Yes, sir.

1238
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:58,208
But I feel apart from
acute schizophrenia...

1239
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:01,083
he suffers from acute physical
and behavioral disorder.

1240
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:05,750
That's affecting him on different levels
along with the mental disorder.

1241
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:11,249
Listen carefully.
You are suffering from a disease.

1242
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:13,666
It's called schizophrenia.
Okay?

1243
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:15,249
It's quite common.
Don't worry.

1244
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:18,207
Take the medicines and attend counseling.
You'll be fine.

1245
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:21,333
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong with me.
Why should I take medicines?

1246
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:23,250
I don't need medicines.
I'm fine.

1247
01:34:23,417 --> 01:34:24,917
You are not fine, Raktim.

1248
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:25,958
What?

1249
01:34:26,167 --> 01:34:29,458
Why do you keep calling me Raktim?

1250
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:31,875
I'm telling you
my name is Amol Shom.

1251
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:36,917
Listen carefully. I am Amol Shom.
And she is Manjari.

1252
01:34:37,917 --> 01:34:39,917
Where is Manjari?
No one is there. See...

1253
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:40,958
What?

1254
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,458
Look closely. No one is there.

1255
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:43,917
Where is Manjari?

1256
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:49,000
Do you see anyone?

1257
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:50,875
Where did Manjari go?

1258
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:53,708
She doesn't exist.
She's part of your imagination.

1259
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,375
- There's no one called Manjari.
- What?

1260
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:57,541
- I'm telling you. Listen to me.
- She was there. Where did she go?

1261
01:34:57,542 --> 01:35:00,000
- Manjari isn't there. She doesn't exist.
- Manjari!

1262
01:35:00,833 --> 01:35:02,750
- Manjari!
- Listen to me.

1263
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:07,000
- Manjari, where did you go? Manjari!
- Amol, relax. Hear me out.

1264
01:35:07,042 --> 01:35:09,166
- Ward boys!
- Where did Manjari go?

1265
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,166
- Manjari!
- There's no Manjari. Relax...

1266
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:12,457
- Take him away.
- Manjari!

1267
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:15,417
- Give him sedatives and keep an eye on him.
- Manjari!

1268
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:17,208
He shouldn't get excited.

1269
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:22,333
Raktim...

1270
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,417
Excuse me, Raktim...

1271
01:35:25,958 --> 01:35:27,958
Raktim, time for your medicines.

1272
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:43,875
Did you have your medicines?

1273
01:35:44,167 --> 01:35:47,750
Your therapy will begin tomorrow.
You'll start feeling better.

1274
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:51,667
Go to bed.
Don’t stay up too late.

1275
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:54,542
I'll switch off the light. Okay?

1276
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,042
Good night, Raktim.

1277
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:58,750
Good night.

1278
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:35,625
Amol...

1279
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:44,000
Why don't you come to me all the time
like you used to, Manjari?

1280
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,042
I still come but you are always asleep.

1281
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,292
That's why you can't see me.

1282
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:55,000
They give me some medicine...

1283
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:57,250
that makes me sleepy all the time.

1284
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,708
But your job is still not done, Amol.

1285
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:03,292
Which job?

1286
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:05,792
You killed Katu.

1287
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:08,000
Aren't you going to kill Nata?

1288
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:09,292
Katu?

1289
01:37:10,542 --> 01:37:13,000
Who is Katu?
I killed him?

1290
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:30,917
You can do it, Amol.

1291
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:32,750
You'll take revenge.

1292
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:40,417
But wouldn't it be better, Manjari...

1293
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,000
if we run away together?

1294
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:47,250
Where will you go?
How many times will you escape?

1295
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:50,542
Why don't you go back home?

1296
01:37:51,667 --> 01:37:54,583
If you can forget me...
Forget Nata...

1297
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:56,374
If you can forget Katu...

1298
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:58,333
If you can forget your revenge...

1299
01:37:58,417 --> 01:38:00,333
Why are you talking like this?

1300
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,917
You don't get it, Amol.

1301
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:07,250
I'm your illness.

1302
01:38:08,417 --> 01:38:12,124
They're going to cure you with medicines.
You won't be able to see me anymore.

1303
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:16,333
No, no, no...
Don't say it, Manjari

1304
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:19,042
I won't be able to live without you.

1305
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:20,958
Can't live without you.

1306
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:27,083
But you left me
to join the revolution, Amol.

1307
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:31,292
You have never wanted
to take me with you, Amol.

1308
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:33,625
Please don't leave me, Manjari.

1309
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:36,458
Please don't go.

1310
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,750
Please don't leave me.

1311
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,792
Are you crying?

1312
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:49,833
This is...

1313
01:38:51,667 --> 01:38:52,792
tear gas...

1314
01:38:58,917 --> 01:39:02,375
Please don't leave me, Manjari.

1315
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:04,583
Please don't leave me.

1316
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,667
Don't go, Manjari.

1317
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:27,167
Light and shadows play freely
in the night

1318
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:33,958
The path seems distant
And all travel suspended

1319
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:39,208
Light and shadows play freely
in the night

1320
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:41,083
DEATH AS HEAVY AS THE MOUNTAIN
YOURS, AMOL

1321
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:47,833
The path seems distant
And all travel suspended

1322
01:39:47,917 --> 01:39:55,167
The siren walks alone
There's silence in applause

1323
01:39:55,292 --> 01:40:01,875
Endless flowers bloom
in its fear of being extinct

1324
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:08,375
I save a million words to describe you

1325
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:15,583
I hope to see you again
Good night, darling

1326
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:22,500
I save a million words to describe you

1327
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:29,707
I hope to see you again
Good night, darling

1328
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:36,291
I save a million words to describe you

1329
01:40:36,292 --> 01:40:44,292
I hope to see you again
Good night, darling

1330
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:46,042
Absolutely better!

1331
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:49,958
That's what I think
and he's responding very positively.

1332
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:52,542
- Please check.
- Okay, fine.

1333
01:40:52,625 --> 01:40:54,166
But don't get him too excited.

1334
01:40:54,167 --> 01:40:56,527
- Have you spoken to the school authorities?
- Yes, we have.

1335
01:40:56,667 --> 01:40:59,292
Raktim, let me introduce you to Dr. Das.

1336
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:01,999
He'll be the one giving you
the clean chit today.

1337
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,208
- I hope so.
- Oh sure... sure.

1338
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,957
- Mr. Chatterjee, government lawyer.
- Hello.

1339
01:41:06,958 --> 01:41:09,042
He's looking into your legal matter.

1340
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:14,292
I've taken a look at your case history,
therapy and medical reports.

1341
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:15,958
This is just a formality.

1342
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:18,833
Can you tell us your name?

1343
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:21,500
Raktim Chowdhury.

1344
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:24,958
Can you tell us which year this is?

1345
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:28,500
Twenty twenty...

1346
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,417
You mean two thousand twenty, right?

1347
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:32,708
Very good.

1348
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,000
Please drink the water.

1349
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,375
- Was there any problem?
- No.

1350
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:49,707
I had problem
drinking water before.

1351
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:51,624
You don't have to cover
your mouth while speaking now?

1352
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:53,750
No. I don't need to.

1353
01:41:53,833 --> 01:41:54,917
Great!

1354
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,333
Do you see that girl or anyone else?

1355
01:41:57,583 --> 01:42:00,375
No, I don't see anyone.

1356
01:42:00,542 --> 01:42:01,833
Brilliant.

1357
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:05,082
Such a quick recovery
in a case like this...

1358
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:07,333
It's just... It's just unexpected.

1359
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:10,375
Thank you, Mr. Sarkar.
You've cured Raktim.

1360
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,750
Don't thank me.

1361
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:14,625
You can thank my team.

1362
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:16,500
But your treatment will continue.

1363
01:42:16,542 --> 01:42:19,042
- You'll come in for therapy once a week.
- Not just that.

1364
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:22,875
Since you're a mental patient
and you've been given bail...

1365
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:25,750
you'll have to report
to the police station regularly.

1366
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:30,417
And the Human Rights Commission
has spoken to the school authorities.

1367
01:42:30,583 --> 01:42:32,393
- If you want you can join the school again.
- Right.

1368
01:42:32,417 --> 01:42:34,292
- They don't have any objection.
- Thank you.

1369
01:42:34,333 --> 01:42:35,667
You're most welcome.

1370
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:37,250
Please sign here.

1371
01:42:38,083 --> 01:42:39,833
Great! So, we're done here.

1372
01:42:40,042 --> 01:42:42,332
Raktim, let's get to work then.

1373
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:45,292
And you've promised me
that you'll start writing again.

1374
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:48,208
Next time you'll have to read something out. Okay?
- Of course.

1375
01:42:48,417 --> 01:42:49,917
- Okay, good luck.
- Okay.

1376
01:42:50,042 --> 01:42:51,875
Okay, all the best.

1377
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,125
Thank you.

1378
01:42:54,083 --> 01:42:56,042
Please try to be well.

1379
01:43:40,167 --> 01:43:42,417
Bultai, sit down and study...

1380
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,417
Oh Raktim?

1381
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:47,667
When did you come?

1382
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,917
Just a few minutes back.

1383
01:43:50,542 --> 01:43:52,792
- Are you okay now?
- Yes, I'm better.

1384
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:54,833
- They released you.
- Yes.

1385
01:43:55,333 --> 01:43:56,833
Can you give me some water?

1386
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,458
Yes, of course.

1387
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:10,416
From now on,
keep some water with you.

1388
01:44:10,417 --> 01:44:12,000
Okay?

1389
01:44:20,167 --> 01:44:21,792
I was very thirsty.

1390
01:44:24,542 --> 01:44:26,167
My keys...

1391
01:44:26,542 --> 01:44:27,750
What keys?

1392
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:32,708
There was new lock on my door.

1393
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:37,583
Actually, what happened, Raktim...

1394
01:44:37,792 --> 01:44:40,583
You were at the hospital...

1395
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:42,583
And Bhuvan also passed away...

1396
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:46,375
But I have to run the household,
you see.

1397
01:44:46,708 --> 01:44:48,292
That's why...

1398
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:51,500
I have rented out the place to a new tenant
who is paying more rent.

1399
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:55,208
I've kept all your things safely
in the storeroom.

1400
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:56,750
You can take it.

1401
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:02,458
- Do I have to take it today?
- No, no.

1402
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:06,875
You can take it whenever you want.
But do it soon.

1403
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:08,708
Because you can understand...

1404
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:11,958
People know what happened to Bhuvan...

1405
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:14,917
Everyone is quite irritated with you.

1406
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,625
Where's Bultai?

1407
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:25,333
He's at school.

1408
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:28,917
And now he...

1409
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,625
goes to bed by himself.

1410
01:45:34,667 --> 01:45:37,958
Okay then...
I'll get going.

1411
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,333
Please don't misunderstand me, Raktim.

1412
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:50,333
I'll never be able to repay your debt.

1413
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:54,625
Bhuvan's photo when he was young.

1414
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:56,167
Manjari!

1415
01:46:00,125 --> 01:46:02,458
I didn't have any other photo.

1416
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:07,417
This fragrance from Varanasi...

1417
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:13,792
All my life...

1418
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:15,375
Just lie down!

1419
01:46:16,958 --> 01:46:19,292
Mom, I'm hungry.
Give me something to eat.

1420
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:21,208
Bultai, keep quiet.

1421
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:24,542
Learn to identify your enemy.

1422
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:27,292
Finish off your enemy, Amol.

1423
01:46:27,458 --> 01:46:29,875
Who else?
Who is my enemy?

1424
01:46:30,042 --> 01:46:31,583
Aren’t you going to kill Nata?

1425
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:34,250
Don't you remember what he did?

1426
01:46:38,417 --> 01:46:41,208
Police... Oh police...

1427
01:46:41,458 --> 01:46:46,417
Before you meet Katu,
take off your hat.

1428
01:46:46,917 --> 01:46:49,583
Go and inform the police.
Hurry up.

1429
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:51,333
Have you left the police station?

1430
01:46:51,667 --> 01:46:53,417
Yes, come straight down that road.

1431
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:57,458
Sir... Sir, come with me quickly.

1432
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,875
There's two storied house on the left
with an iron gate.

1433
01:47:00,917 --> 01:47:03,041
Sir, there's a man living in the attic
in that house.

1434
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,375
Sir, Naxal! Sir, bomb!

1435
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:06,792
Please come fast.
I'm at the gate.

1436
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:09,625
I remember, Manjari.

1437
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:13,000
They've got me caught
time and again.

1438
01:47:39,667 --> 01:47:42,000
That crazy guy
must have bugged you a lot.

1439
01:47:42,667 --> 01:47:44,458
He didn't just bug me...

1440
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:46,833
he scared me with his teeth.

1441
01:47:47,708 --> 01:47:49,458
Even you'd be scared.

1442
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,542
Don't be scared, darling.
I'm here.

1443
01:47:51,583 --> 01:47:53,417
Yeah, right.

1444
01:47:54,625 --> 01:47:57,083
He loved you a lot, didn't he?

1445
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:58,792
Stop joking.

1446
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,375
I have to go now.

1447
01:48:01,417 --> 01:48:03,208
Why are you going?

1448
01:48:03,292 --> 01:48:05,500
- Bultai will wake up...
- Don't go, please.

1449
01:48:05,542 --> 01:48:07,125
- Come on...
- Let me go.

1450
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:10,792
I'm free in the afternoon tomorrow.
Will you come?

1451
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:12,707
I'll think about it later.

1452
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:14,667
Shut the door on your way out.

1453
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:16,875
And switch off the light.

1454
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:28,667
Raktim?

1455
01:48:29,875 --> 01:48:31,958
What are you doing here?

1456
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:34,542
Why are you dressed like a joker?

1457
01:48:36,292 --> 01:48:37,750
Leave!

1458
01:48:37,792 --> 01:48:39,250
Get out of here.

1459
01:48:40,708 --> 01:48:43,041
I'm asking you to leave right now.

1460
01:48:43,042 --> 01:48:51,042
When the moon sets
When the night ends

1461
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,374
The blind stars return home

1462
01:48:54,375 --> 01:48:58,458
Manjari, Katu, Nata
are part of your imagination, Raktim.

1463
01:48:58,708 --> 01:49:00,416
Amol Shom doesn't exist.

1464
01:49:00,417 --> 01:49:02,083
Go away.

1465
01:49:03,167 --> 01:49:07,332
You needed a story
to transform yourself into Dracula.

1466
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:08,832
A myth.

1467
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:11,624
Manjari, Katu, Nata...

1468
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:14,292
are all characters in that story.

1469
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:16,792
You're unwell, Raktim.

1470
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:19,208
You need treatment.

1471
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:23,875
Everything is forgotten

1472
01:49:24,208 --> 01:49:31,417
Everything that shines
is put to sleep

1473
01:49:32,333 --> 01:49:36,083
A lonely sleepless monster

1474
01:49:36,333 --> 01:49:40,166
The familiar illusions of the blue planet

1475
01:49:40,167 --> 01:49:43,999
Among the dusty stars
the flyover spreads its wings

1476
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,207
And fly away
on this night of reckoning

1477
01:49:47,208 --> 01:49:50,958
Whose forgotten call is it?

1478
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,124
Let it be his alone

1479
01:49:55,125 --> 01:49:59,417
Do you remember
where's Manjari's house, Raktim?

1480
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:01,667
Can you tell us the address?

1481
01:50:03,333 --> 01:50:09,667
Don't you remember the address of the house
you lived in for so long?

1482
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:19,250
The lonely monster
looks for his home

1483
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:23,458
Everything is forgotten...

1484
01:50:23,792 --> 01:50:28,542
CHAPTER 7
A REJECTED BOX

1485
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:31,833
How much will you pay for these?

1486
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,292
Ten rupees.

1487
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,833
I have get rid of my past tenant's stuff.

1488
01:50:37,417 --> 01:50:39,875
RECORD OF THE NAXAL MOVEMENT

1489
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,042
THE SEVENTIES

1490
01:50:51,167 --> 01:50:53,082
This valley of death is not my country...

1491
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:54,207
TO RAKTIM
FROM DAD

1492
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,832
THIS VALLEY OF DEATH IS NOT MY COUNTRY
NABARUN BHATTACHARYA

1493
01:50:55,833 --> 01:51:00,042
"This blood soaked slaughterhouse
is not my country."

1494
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:01,417
Amol used to say this.

1495
01:51:01,708 --> 01:51:04,250
You're talking about 1971.

1496
01:51:04,333 --> 01:51:07,083
But this book was published in 1982.

1497
01:51:09,292 --> 01:51:11,125
Charu Majumdar...

1498
01:51:11,208 --> 01:51:15,250
You talked about Charu Majumdar's death
in Manjari's attic.

1499
01:51:15,417 --> 01:51:17,332
That was the winter on 1971.

1500
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:20,958
And Charu Majumdar died in July, 1972.

1501
01:51:22,167 --> 01:51:25,083
Why did you bite Bhuvan?

1502
01:51:25,792 --> 01:51:26,958
He is Katu.

1503
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:28,458
How did you know?

1504
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:32,250
Katu, Nata... are all made up.

1505
01:51:32,292 --> 01:51:36,042
You're trying to justify yourself
with Amol's story.

1506
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:39,750
Bhuvan called me Amol.

1507
01:51:40,375 --> 01:51:41,500
Then?

1508
01:51:41,625 --> 01:51:42,749
Why did he call me Amol?

1509
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:45,208
Our report says Bhuvan was already dead.

1510
01:51:45,292 --> 01:51:48,042
Even before you reached the hospital.

1511
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:51,125
You imagined all of it.
Isn't it?

1512
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:59,792
Bhuvan, I made a mistake.
I have come to ask for your forgiveness.

1513
01:51:59,875 --> 01:52:01,583
No, no... No...

1514
01:52:02,417 --> 01:52:03,542
No...

1515
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:05,583
No...

1516
01:52:19,708 --> 01:52:21,625
DAINIK BARTA
ALAS VIDYASAGAR

1517
01:52:32,375 --> 01:52:35,208
Manjari brought me my flute.

1518
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:37,667
You must have seen that too somewhere.

1519
01:52:42,333 --> 01:52:45,749
"Following the sound of the flute

1520
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:52,292
The broken umbrella and the royal parasol
floats away towards heaven..."

1521
01:52:55,667 --> 01:52:59,207
You have no idea how they tortured us.

1522
01:52:59,208 --> 01:53:01,249
You don't know...

1523
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:04,083
They burnt her neck with cigar...

1524
01:53:04,333 --> 01:53:06,875
It left dark marks on her neck.

1525
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,917
You don't know anything.

1526
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:12,083
You must have seen it somewhere, Raktim.

1527
01:53:19,542 --> 01:53:20,542
Okay...

1528
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:24,833
The attic that you...
I mean Amol was hiding...

1529
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:26,500
Try to remember that.

1530
01:53:26,542 --> 01:53:28,833
Mirror... There was a mirror.

1531
01:53:29,083 --> 01:53:33,292
There was a light above the mirror.

1532
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:40,125
Where have you seen that room before?

1533
01:53:50,083 --> 01:53:51,166
That house is not there.

1534
01:53:51,167 --> 01:53:54,083
It doesn't exist.
It's all in your head.

1535
01:53:54,292 --> 01:53:56,624
Why can't you tell me
where Manjari's house is?

1536
01:53:56,625 --> 01:53:57,625
Give me the address.

1537
01:53:57,667 --> 01:54:00,542
If Amol has been there,
you must know the address.

1538
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:02,042
Jog your memory and tell me.

1539
01:54:12,667 --> 01:54:14,000
Tear gas...

1540
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:15,208
No...

1541
01:54:15,209 --> 01:54:16,542
What a beautiful name!

1542
01:54:51,542 --> 01:54:55,917
CONCLUSION

1543
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:14,875
Excuse me.

1544
01:55:16,375 --> 01:55:17,792
Can you hear me?

1545
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:22,000
Hello...

1546
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:28,083
You?

1547
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:29,917
I am Raktim.

1548
01:55:30,167 --> 01:55:33,167
You mean Raktim,
the school teacher?

1549
01:55:34,875 --> 01:55:38,792
Why are you wearing this strange costume?

1550
01:55:40,083 --> 01:55:42,250
They dressed me up like this.

1551
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:44,875
Who are you?

1552
01:55:45,458 --> 01:55:46,958
I am Amol.

1553
01:55:47,958 --> 01:55:49,500
Amol Shom.

1554
01:55:54,167 --> 01:55:56,250
Amol Shom...

1555
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:57,958
AMOL SHOM
1951-1972

1556
01:55:58,167 --> 01:56:00,000
Did you know Amol Shom?

1557
01:56:01,208 --> 01:56:03,208
I did.

1558
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:09,207
Actually, he chose revolution over love.

1559
01:56:09,208 --> 01:56:16,000
When the state machinery
finished off the revolution...

1560
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,292
He went back to Manjari for shelter.

1561
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:21,125
His ex-girlfriend.

1562
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:23,750
But Manjari couldn't hide him
for a long time.

1563
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:27,791
One day the police picked up
both of them.

1564
01:56:27,792 --> 01:56:30,458
I don't know what happened after that.

1565
01:56:30,958 --> 01:56:34,042
But I think, maybe on a foggy morning...

1566
01:56:34,458 --> 01:56:36,792
the police took him to the open grounds...

1567
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:38,917
shot him dead.

1568
01:56:40,833 --> 01:56:44,000
If Amol had really died...

1569
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:47,458
Then who are you?

1570
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:49,458
Amol didn't die.

1571
01:56:50,667 --> 01:56:52,958
He couldn't endure the torture.

1572
01:56:53,208 --> 01:56:55,458
He gave the police the names
of his comrades.

1573
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:59,292
Amol betrayed his revolution.

1574
01:57:00,208 --> 01:57:03,875
He became the state's witness.

1575
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:06,042
He was released after some time.

1576
01:57:06,208 --> 01:57:09,417
Out of guilt and shame,
he ran away.

1577
01:57:09,458 --> 01:57:12,000
He even went West.

1578
01:57:12,583 --> 01:57:17,583
When he came back he saw
that a martyr's memorial was built for him.

1579
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:20,958
That's why he didn't give
his real identity.

1580
01:57:21,583 --> 01:57:26,583
Actually when the two of us
were arrested...

1581
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:31,417
Manjari has been missing since then.

1582
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,708
Sometimes, I...

1583
01:57:33,958 --> 01:57:35,917
come here in the morning to check...

1584
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:38,583
if Manjari has returned.

1585
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:40,708
I know...

1586
01:57:40,958 --> 01:57:43,083
Manjari will come back one day.

1587
01:57:44,167 --> 01:57:46,458
But how did you get here?

1588
01:57:46,667 --> 01:57:49,500
I didn't tell you where Manjari's house is
that day.

1589
01:57:49,542 --> 01:57:51,500
I don't know.

1590
01:57:52,292 --> 01:57:56,417
I... I...
I really don't know.

1591
01:57:56,958 --> 01:57:58,458
Do you want to go inside?

1592
01:57:59,083 --> 01:58:00,792
No, no, no, no...

1593
01:58:01,458 --> 01:58:03,542
- I won't go... I have class.
- Okay.

1594
01:58:03,583 --> 01:58:06,125
- I can't go. I have class.
- What happened?

1595
01:58:06,208 --> 01:58:07,750
- I have class.
- Raktim?

1596
01:58:08,125 --> 01:58:08,917
I have class.

1597
01:58:08,958 --> 01:58:11,083
'As the "Sindhu" raga starts playing...

1598
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:15,666
The sky starts playing the eternal pain
of the universe.

1599
01:58:15,667 --> 01:58:17,875
Then in the moment is caught...

1600
01:58:17,917 --> 01:58:20,250
This lane is an illusion...

1601
01:58:20,833 --> 01:58:24,000
just like the raving of a miserable drunk.

1602
01:58:24,542 --> 01:58:27,000
Suddenly I realise...

1603
01:58:27,292 --> 01:58:34,042
There's no difference between
Emperor Akbar and clerk Haripada.

1604
01:58:34,458 --> 01:58:37,792
Along the melancholy tunes of the flute...

1605
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:42,333
The broken umbrella
and the royal parasol...

1606
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:45,208
float towards the same heaven.

1607
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,708
Where this song is true...

1608
01:58:47,833 --> 01:58:50,042
In the eternal sunset...

1609
01:58:50,167 --> 01:58:53,375
Flows River Dhaleshwari.

1610
01:59:01,292 --> 01:59:03,167
This is Manjari's house.

1611
01:59:03,792 --> 01:59:06,958
Whose address I couldn't tell you.

1612
01:59:08,542 --> 01:59:10,583
Amol was hiding here?

1613
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:14,875
But I'm not Amol.

1614
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:18,833
You are not Amol?

1615
01:59:19,542 --> 01:59:20,958
Then?

1616
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:24,708
Raktim, if you are not Amol...

1617
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:29,000
then you have to find a different character
in this story.

1618
01:59:30,625 --> 01:59:32,375
Did you find it?

1619
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:15,292
I know you'll be hurt

1620
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:22,917
But I can't accept the pride
hidden in your lips

1621
02:00:23,208 --> 02:00:26,750
I know you'll feel like crying

1622
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:34,750
Our tombstone will be a witness
to our distance

1623
02:00:49,958 --> 02:00:53,375
I know you'll be hurt

1624
02:00:53,583 --> 02:01:00,958
But I can't accept the pride
hidden in your lips

1625
02:01:01,333 --> 02:01:04,750
I know you'll feel like crying

1626
02:01:05,083 --> 02:01:12,458
Our tombstone will be a witness
to our distance

1627
02:01:12,542 --> 02:01:19,167
I will be born again

1628
02:01:19,875 --> 02:01:27,667
I'll be the last to come home
Your time traveller

1629
02:01:28,083 --> 02:01:34,750
I will be born again

1630
02:01:35,167 --> 02:01:42,125
My face might change
But you'll know my voice

1631
02:01:42,208 --> 02:01:45,124
But whether this story is true or false...

1632
02:01:45,125 --> 02:01:47,624
An illness or some memory
from an earlier birth...

1633
02:01:47,625 --> 02:01:51,417
Let that be unknown for now.
