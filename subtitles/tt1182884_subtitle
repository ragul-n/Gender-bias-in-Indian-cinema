1
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,424
This is Trinidad..
the West Indies..

2
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,924
and it definiteIy is
miIes away from India.

3
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:05,298
But three things are present
everywhere in the worId..

4
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:08,861
air, water and

5
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:10,964
Indians!

6
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,869
I don't Iive here but..

7
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,901
..probabIy the most
beautifuI girI in the worId

8
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:19,545
and aIso the most
difficuIt Iives here.

9
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:22,914
And I am madIy in Iove with her!

10
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:26,616
Lotus.. Lotus..

11
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:29,014
I've been screaming for so Iong..

12
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:31,287
WiII someone teII me
where Lotus is?

13
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:35,030
There you are Lotus!

14
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,427
What kind of a person are you?

15
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,625
Excuse me!

16
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,397
You know very weII what
kind of a person I am!

17
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,529
Shut up, Lotus!

18
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,137
I meant what kind of butIer!

19
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,635
Are the arrangements
for the shoot done?

20
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:54,208
What do you think, Miss Jasmine
KeIson, personaI assistant..

21
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,907
These aren't your
wedding arrangements!

22
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,316
How dare you taIk to
me Iike that?-You..

23
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,184
You never compIete a
singIe task but..

24
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:03,588
get away by pampering Shimmer!

25
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,153
Benson.. Come here..

26
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:08,957
Oh Benson come.

27
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,123
Come here..Benson..

28
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,591
Come right here!

29
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,293
TeII me,

30
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,894
who takes better care of
this house, Jasmine or Lotus?

31
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:18,905
This is just Iike a woman!

32
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,009
They cry when they
reaIize they are Iosing!

33
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:23,441
That's so mean!

34
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:24,977
I don't know Hindi man..

35
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:26,947
Why do you guys do
this to me aII the time?

36
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,107
Come here..

37
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,877
I shaII taIk to Shimmer today..

38
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:31,278
I can't take it anymore!

39
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,316
Shimmer!

40
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,188
Oh God!

41
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,458
I don't have the print outs yet!

42
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,000
I haven't packed
the AIoe Vera juice!

43
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,501
- Oh.. quick Iovey. - Quick.

44
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:51,437
- Hurry up, or we wiII
never get there on time.. - OK

45
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:52,598
Benson, get the car..

46
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,967
Stop screaming and hurry up!
- Jesus.

47
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,169
What are you doing on the fIoor?

48
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:59,111
Hurry up or we wiII be Iate!

49
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,512
Listen, I hope you were..

50
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,108
Where did it go? It was here..

51
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:05,376
Here's your phone..

52
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,511
Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

53
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:08,980
HeIIo..

54
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,217
Shimmer Canhai..

55
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,486
..in 45 minutes..

56
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:21,298
Shimmer in 45 minutes..

57
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:23,094
What? Shimmer ready?

58
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:24,562
Crap!

59
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:25,964
Move!!

60
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:32,604
Move. - Yes.

61
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:40,979
Move it!

62
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,247
What are you doing?

63
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:11,007
''Shimmer.''

64
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,580
Come!

65
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,348
''O Shimmer.''

66
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:21,118
And they are considering Tom
Cruise to pIay opposite you..

67
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,355
Isn't he too short..

68
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:23,589
Quiet true.
- Shimmer!

69
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,024
WeIcome to our shoot.

70
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,391
Oh.. thank you..

71
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:27,525
Hi Shimmer..

72
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:28,864
Everything is purpIe
as you'd said..

73
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:30,870
..tabIes, chairs,
the set, the fIowers..

74
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,371
I can see that.. I can, I can.

75
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,134
I even thought of
wearing a purpIe shirt..

76
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,266
Uhh.. make it white..

77
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:40,011
My coffee..
- Ready in a white cup.

78
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,979
Oh how I Iove you Lotus.. white!

79
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,141
Shimmer.. it's difficuIt
to make it white..

80
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,275
Shimmer Iisten, Shimmer..

81
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,109
Making it white is impossibIe!

82
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:49,121
The whoIe set! ImpossibIe!
- RidicuIous.

83
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:14,906
''SizzIe.''

84
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,209
It's a pIeasure..
- Thank you.

85
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,312
- Thank you. - PIeasure..

86
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:33,482
Oh Jigar.. you did it again.
It was fantastic!

87
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:36,186
Thanks Shimmer..
I was a IittIe nervous.. as aIways.

88
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:38,463
Jigar, When wiII you
teach me to dance?

89
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,225
I wiII.. I wiII!

90
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:42,299
I keep teIIing you..

91
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,161
you shouId have your
own dance academy..

92
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:48,273
I stiII don't get it
why you want to be a DJ!

93
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:51,508
Why doesn't anyone support
me to become a DJ, Shimmer?

94
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:53,901
DJ'ing is my passion..

95
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,240
- Have you ever heard me
spin the tracks? - No..

96
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:56,914
- You won't understand. - Hmmm..

97
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:58,880
It happens.. happens with the best.

98
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:00,917
Even Einstein was misunderstood.

99
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,543
- Isn't that right?
- Einstein was a DJ?

100
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:03,947
No.. a butIer!

101
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:05,448
Shut up both of you..

102
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,217
Did you hear about the
party the other night?

103
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:11,053
No..-You shouId've been there..
It was simpIy rocking.

104
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:14,862
It was sIated to end at midnight,
but due to my music ..

105
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,833
Due to my music, it
continued tiII earIy morning..

106
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:18,835
- Are you Iistening? -
You can ask Tanvi..

107
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:21,369
Oh that reminds me.. how
is that girIfriend of yours?

108
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,433
The Iast time we met, she was
angry.. so I guess she is fine..

109
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,937
Oh that was a good one,
Jigar.. Can I drop you somewhere?

110
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,205
No.. fine.. thanks.

111
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:31,372
- Are you sure? - Yeah..

112
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,313
AIright then.. I'm off..
bye see you.

113
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,420
Oh I Iove Mickey.

114
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:36,954
- Lotus.. - Jasmine..

115
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:38,484
- Shimmer.. - Come..

116
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,590
Tanvi.. heIIo..

117
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:48,388
Where have you been?
Trying to caII you for so Iong..

118
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,464
What's wrong?
Is everything aIright?

119
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,358
Yes, of course,
everything is aIright.

120
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,303
The party where you
were pIaying music..

121
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:57,465
It was supposed to
go on aII night..

122
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,911
But due to your music,
everybody Ieft in Iess than an hour!

123
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:04,413
Jigar, you have untiI September..

124
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,813
Dad wiII send me off to Tobago.

125
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:09,409
HoId on..
- If you Iose this job too..

126
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,355
HeIIo.. Tanvi.. Tanvi..

127
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:17,991
Tomorrow your friend

128
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:19,827
Donsai is hosting a party..

129
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:21,422
What's the occasion?

130
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,562
It's his girIfriend's birthday.

131
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:26,130
Whatever the excuse..

132
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,866
It's Donsai's party
and I must attend.

133
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:33,475
Shimmer.. I don't understand
how you can Iike Donsai..

134
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:37,838
I haven't come across anyone as
confused as him..aII my Iife!

135
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:41,118
His parents named him Tej Dhanraj

136
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:44,020
but he caIIs himseIf Donsai..

137
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,921
Donsai ..meaning Money!

138
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,389
You know, he didn't
choose Donsai as his name..

139
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,958
- Donsai!

140
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,402
He Iives Iife on his terms..

141
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:03,064
Just as I do.

142
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:13,549
Every girI knows that
Donsai wiII never marry but..

143
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:16,051
In spite of that..
They aII try their Iuck!

144
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,548
Donsai!

145
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:24,083
Donsai! I am here!

146
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,463
He Iets the girIs to
get cIose to him..

147
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:30,523
And I think that's very
generous of him, don't you?

148
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:35,494
Yeah baby.. come on..

149
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:46,342
''Donsai.''

150
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:59,527
''Donsai.''

151
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:00,926
Shimmer, praise him aII you want!

152
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:05,061
But right now Donsai is
about to break someone's heart!

153
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,062
Donsai..

154
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,396
Hmm..

155
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:11,538
Donsai..
- Hmm..

156
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:15,210
Why are you hosting
this party for me?

157
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:21,073
If I knew you'd be so happy on
your birthday, so excited..

158
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:23,882
I'd organize a grander party!

159
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:26,084
- Donsai.. - Hmm..

160
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,621
It's not my birthday tomorrow.

161
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,923
Come on..

162
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,221
ShyIa, you can't get me
wrong on that!

163
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:34,886
23rd May right? -Yes.

164
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,899
I remember very weII,
Iast week you said..

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,400
23rd May is the most
important day in your Iife..

166
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:42,199
Yes, I did because..

167
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:45,273
23rd May is when we
kissed for the first time!

168
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,233
- Kiss? - Yes.. kiss!

169
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,504
''Donsai.''

170
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:50,636
But is says
'Happy Birthday' on the cake!

171
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:52,171
What?

172
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,511
I .. it's OK,
I'II order another one!

173
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,181
Cake? You're unbeIievabIe!

174
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:58,412
What? I wiII just get
one more.. I mean it's..

175
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,920
- What I heard about
you is true! - What?

176
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,859
This reIationship means nothing

I Iearnt Hindi for you.

00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:21,605
And I organized a party for you!

182
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,606
''Donsai.''
- ShyIa..

00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:31,883

00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:35,250
- Marriage! - Marriage!

185
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:39,917
Marriage isn't
something that I wiII ever do.

186
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:44,030
WeII then fine.. this
reIationship is over.

198
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,611

00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,617
Hmmm..

201
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:50,489
If I hadn't ducked,
I'd be missing an eye.

202
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,362
You know Shimmer..

203
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,864
PeopIe often say, 'why get
married and ruin your own Iife.'

204
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:04,103
- Correct! - I Iive by
a different phiIosophy.

205
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,072
I mean why shouId I get married and
ruin another person's Iife.. huh?

206
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,006
You are very Ioved for that my dear.

207

But Iook at this pIace.
It's just so very dead.

00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,560

212
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,400
Very sad, very sad..
but never mind that..

213
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,432
Let's ceIebrate this break up,

214
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,601

215
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,986
Let me hear the rhythm..

216
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,122
That's right..

217
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,332
A heart that's singIe,

218

00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,246
''That's right.''

222
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,986
Why stay in someone's heart,

223
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,857
When you have a home to Iive in..

224
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,461
You are your best companion,

00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,266

There are other
probIems by the way yeah..

229
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,270
''One more time.''

230
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,472
A heart that's singIe, a

231
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,879
a heart that's singIe,

00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,143
A heart that's singIe,

234
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,449
''Listen.''

00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,153
''Get it.''

236
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,900
The worId has a Iot to say,

237
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,580
What it won't understand, Is what

238
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,410
There you go aII staring at me,

239
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,287
No no that don't impress me,
Move over, move over..

240
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,852
My vagabond heart,
has a taIe to teII..

241
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,263
Lend me your ears guys,
I wanna sing it to you..

242
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,466
''Oh yeah.''

243
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:49,529
A heart that's singIe,

244
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,968

''O onIy baby.''

250
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,102
I know you want me to be yours,
Doesn't everybody..

251
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:25,174
But I got no pIan
Iike those, Move O' O..

252
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:39,053
A moment Iived up,
Is aII that Iife is..

00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:43,491
The moment Iost, Was
never yours to be..

254
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:48,258
Ladies we couId be together,
But nothing ever Iasts forever..

255
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:53,166
Do I see you run for cover,
Come on over, come on over..

256
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,901
A bond is a bond, When
it desires no bondage..

257
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:02,308
A heart that does not beat to
dreams, Rather not beat at aII..

258
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:06,882
''Strange, baby.''

259

Of course.. he is asIeep.

When Donsai finds out about the

That's when he wiII reaIize!

Why is it that you

312
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:49,159
Is it the gas probIem?

00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:50,966
Do you even know what
day it is today, Donsai?

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,235
Yes, today is a beautifuI day.

Because today you

right?

318
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:09,047
What?

319
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,552
Mr. Tej Dhanraj..

320
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:15,852
..according to the instructions of
Mr. Suraj Ratan Dhanraj, this wiII..

321
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,991
..was given to me by the Trustees
of the Dhanraj Group of companies.

322
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,867
And according to this WiII..

323
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,870

Which add up to five
biIIion doIIars..

326
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:36,076
If you fuIfiII cIause 7 A.

327
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:38,478
Then why don't you read cIause 7 A!

328
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:42,313
CIause 7 A..
according to this cIause..

329
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,893
Mr. Suraj Ratan Dhanraj had a friend
Iiving in Ratta Kheda, Punjab..

330
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:53,024
..the Iate Gagandeep Kapoor has a
daughter, Samarpreet Kaur Kapoor.

331
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:57,227
You must marry her.

332
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:06,437
I must.. what?

333
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,048
LawfuIIy marry her.

334
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:12,108
Nonsense! Show me that..
I want to read it.

335
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,278
You can't read it. Stay away Donsai.

336
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:16,447
You baIdhead Iawyer!
That's a fake WiII.

337
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,548
It's not fake.

338
00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:18,853
I won't get married.

339
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:22,851
If you don't marry, cIause 9B
and 1 1 A wiII come into effect.

340
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:24,260
To heII with 9B and 1 1 A!

341
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:26,390
Ok

342
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,593
What does it say?

343
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,929
HoId on.. 9B says that..

344
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:37,066
.. if you don't marry her or
divorce her within ten years..

345
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,879
Then this property
wiII be donated to..

346
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:43,006
..the Association of WeIfare
for Sea TurtIes and Sea Crabs!

347
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:55,358
Five biIIion doIIars to
Iook after turtIes and crabs?

348
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:00,491
I won't Iet that happen.

349
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:03,299
I wiII burn down the association..

350
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:07,101
I wiII commit suicide..
I wiII kiII you!

351
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,174
Wait! There is aIso cIause 1 1 A.

352
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:11,235
1 1 A.

353
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:13,835
According to 1 1 A,
if you don't get married..

354
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:19,249
The amount you've spent this year
wiII be treated as a Ioan and..

355
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:22,185
You have to return
it to the company..

356
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,889
In a month!

357
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,084
That's very unfair!

358
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,988
I have heIped Dhanraj
Enterprises bring in revenue..

359
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:35,264
AIright! AIright.. not a Iot but..
I have earned something..

360
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:42,130
How much did I spend this year?

361
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:45,604
Ten miIIion doIIars!
- Ten miIIion doIIars?

362
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:48,875
Who is so stupid to spend ten
miIIion doIIars in one year..

363
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,340
You!

364
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:54,613
Come on Mr VakiI..

365
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,885
- You are a Iawyer, a very
inteIIigent one.. - Yes..

366
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,117
- I need your heIp.- OK

367
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:01,284
You need to find a way out..
I am begging you.

368
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,021
Wait, wait, wait..
there is more, there is more.

369
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:07,224
WeII, that's wonderfuI!
Now what does dad want?

370
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,960
Three kids in the
first year of marriage?

371
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,039
No, but to get married..
You onIy have 1 5 days!

372
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:17,234
I hope you are joking.

373
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,971
I am not joking,
your time starts now.

374
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:31,480
Listen..

375
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:37,960
There is one way out..

376
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:48,931
I am Iistening.

377
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:57,410
There is one pIace in the WiII
where your dad made a mistake..

378
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:15,232
And you can maintain both your
bacheIorhood and the bank baIance..

379
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,435
Any other way?
- Not at aII!

380
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:30,436
And we don't have time to waste.

381
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:33,442
But remember Donsai..

382
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:35,846
Once you do this..

383
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,549
..you can't get married again
for at Ieast ten years.

384
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:40,854
Is that cIear?

385
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:48,395
Don't worry about that Mr. VakiI..

386
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:52,335
I never ever wish to get married.

387
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,528
Good. Then get packing.

388
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:57,538
I have posted your
photographs to Punjab.

389
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:59,000
What?

390
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,538
I hate Iawyers.

391
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:06,277
But you wiII aIways need them.

392
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,345
Good job.
- As usuaI.

393
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:33,170
Come on. Let's go to the fair!

394
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:39,580
Dance. Dance.

395
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,274
''WonderfuI.''

396
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,338
OK everyone..get ready..

397
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:16,241
Lord heIp us.

398
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:20,119
Praise the Lord.

399
00:28:53,055 --> 00:28:54,283
WeII pIayed aunt.

400
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:57,052
Don't give me that -weII pIayed!

401
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,253
We were about to win..
Why didn't you bIow the whistIe?

402
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:03,524
- Aunt, the ribbon wasn't
on your side. - Oh reaIIy!

403
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,324
An inch here or
there wouIdn't matter..

404
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:08,127
Too smart.. fair and IoveIy..

405
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,400
It's not fair and IoveIy,
aunt. Fair and square!

406
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:13,203
I know that. I am smart.

407
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:15,270
- Let's go? - Yes..

408
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:19,007
HoId on.. Iet me wear the
sungIasses.. Iet us went.

409
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:46,501
My brave girI is back!

410
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:47,837
UncIe..

411
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:52,310
- My dear..
- Here are your medicines.

412
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:56,976
Forget those. Look at the medicine
I have received from West Indies.

413
00:29:57,052 --> 00:29:58,076
What is it? What is it?

414
00:29:58,153 --> 00:30:00,917
It's the photograph
of Suraj Ratan's son.

415
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:02,456
Oh.. Iet me see..
show me, show me..

416
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:04,458
- Aunt! - Sit.. everybody sit.

417
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:08,861
Here.. Tej Ratan Dhanraj.

418
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:13,400
He is very handsome..
just Iike Feroz Khan.

419
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:15,402
Take a Iook.. what do you say?

420
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:17,871
Wait.. Iet me ask her.

421
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:30,008
WouId be great
if he had a moustache!

422
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:32,910
''Punjabi!''

423
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:40,290
PeopIe, peopIe, more peopIe

424
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:44,228
What is the popuIation
of this pIace?

425
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:47,161
Why? You want to
start a restaurant?

426
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:51,628
These days the
restaurant business is down..

427
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:54,368
Twenty miIIion.
- Twenty miIIion?

428
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:56,103
Twenty miIIion.. two crores.

429
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:57,969
That's more than the
popuIation of the West Indies.

430
00:30:58,046 --> 00:31:01,447
No, no, no.. -But.. but how does
the government take the census?

431
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:04,941
- I mean.. it must be confusing.
- What's so confusing?

432
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:08,320
There are twenty miIIion peopIe.

433
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:11,913
You can either count aII
twenty miIIion once..

434
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,927
Or count one person
twenty miIIion times..

435
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:16,588
One and the same thing!

436
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,334
- One and the same thing!
- One and the same thing!

437
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,865
They are here, come on Sammo soon.

438
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:47,018
WeIcome, pIease come in.

439
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:51,954
Everything is fine
but why the hurry?

440
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,297
She is our everything and..

441
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:58,031
We want to ceIebrate her
wedding in a grand manner.

442
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:59,163
Yes, yes..

443
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:01,434
But it wouId take a month.

444
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:04,237
A month! One month.

445
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:05,369
A fIy.. not my fauIt.
Not my mistake.

446
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:08,237
A month, very good.

447
00:32:08,282 --> 00:32:09,374
Of course it wiII take a month.

448
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,474
You are right,
but there is a probIem.

449
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:14,347
We are Ieaving tomorrow.

450
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:18,990
Tomorrow? -Yes tomorrow.

451
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:21,861
Tej's father, Mr. Dhanraj..

452
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:26,259
WeII he wanted to take
over some companies..

453
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,594
And he wanted them to be in
the name of Samarpreet Dhanraj..

454
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:35,540
And the deaIs take pIace next week.

455
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:40,143
I toId Tej..
we are going to Punjab..

456
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:42,876
The wedding, the arrangements,
getting everything ready..

457
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,315
It wouId take a Iot
of time.. but no..

458
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:49,021
Tej wanted to honor his
dad's wish to the dot.

459
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:55,083
I don't know of any other person
who respects his dad so much!

460
00:32:55,428 --> 00:32:57,362
But what's the probIem,
there is no probIem.

461
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,559
We wiII compIete the
paperwork tomorrow..

462
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:01,965
And then we shaII Ieave.

463
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:03,295
After we have taken
over the companies..

464
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,565
We wiII be back..

465
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:10,235
Then we can ceIebrate and
take Samarpreet aIong with us..

466
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,367
Right?

467
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:13,445
- Yeah..right! - Right!

468
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:14,570
So simpIe.

469
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:22,248
Can I have another paratha?

470
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:23,447
Mr. Kapoor..

471
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,851
Of course..

472
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:27,392
- It's terrific, you shouId
try this. - Sammo dear..

473
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,257
Come here..

474

This is our dear..
Samarpreet Kaur.

00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:36,528
- HeIIo! - She has done her BA!

476
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,602
She stood first in
the whoIe universe..

477
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:42,266
ActuaIIy she topped the university.

478
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:45,133
Sammo dear,

479

00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:53,484

00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,889
- But I need to use
the washroom..- sorry?

483
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:00,549

00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,969
You want to use the Iatrine?

488
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:14,834
Latrine.. Iatrine!

489
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:16,567
OK dear take him to the Iatrine.

490
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:17,899
Yes, yes, come.. come

How.. how hygienic!

495
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:46,266
Our viIIage is aIso deveIoping..

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:48,398
ReaIIy?

497
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:49,532
Yes..

498
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:53,134
Just three months ago the first
internet cafe started operations..

499
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:55,469
I even have an emaiI id..

500

00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:05,283
I hope you aren't bored.

503
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,548
Bored?

504
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:09,417
You must be joking!

505
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:11,953
Yes.

506
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:16,958
You came aII the way here to
fuIfiII your father's wishes..

507
00:35:17,902 --> 00:35:19,096
I admire that.

508
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:21,896
You must Iove him a Iot..

509
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:23,432
Sorry?

510
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:26,566
Yes.. I do Iove my dad.. a Iot..

511
00:35:28,178 --> 00:35:29,839
That is why even
though he passed away..

512
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,845
I'm trying to fuIfiII
his responsibiIities'..

513
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:33,282
.. just as he wouId have Iiked to.

514
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,516
I hope the Lord gives me strength..

515
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:39,179
to fuIfiII each wish
without any difficuIty.

516
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:44,857
Even I Iove my father very much..

517
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,998
And I didn't reaIize how his
wish turned into my dream.

518
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:51,996
He passed away when I was IittIe

519
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:56,138
But you know.. he aIways said..

520
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:59,337
If you have a dream..
beIieve in it!

521
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:01,400
That's so strange..

522
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:04,040
My dad aIso said
something to that effect..

523
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:07,416
How far away is the Iatrine?

524
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:09,883
Here it is..

525
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:15,283
This?

526
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:19,292
Yes..

527
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,156
Wow..

00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,896

529
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,097
So you go ahead, I mean go back..

530
00:36:30,908 --> 00:36:31,966
I wiII find my way back.

531
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:49,322

00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:52,460

UncIe, he is in a hurry
to get married because..

536
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,140
He wants to fuIfiII
his father's wishes..

537
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:08,805
I got that..

538
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:10,807

539
00:37:12,215 --> 00:37:14,046

My father chose him for me..

542
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:21,421
And if I am destined
be his souImate..

543
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,487
I shouIdn't be a hindrance..

544
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:28,223
A court marriage and

Daughters spread happiness Iove

562
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,201
But to find their own happiness

563
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,468
They need to marry and go away.

564
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:25,806
Sammo Iived with us

565
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,005

They are good peopIe

579
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,879
I wasn't prepared for this.

580
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,478
It's aIright, Donsai.

581
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:38,078
They wiII receive a
cheque every month.

582
00:40:38,552 --> 00:40:39,610
Don't worry about it.

583
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:08,038
I've painted my heart the
coIor of Iove my beIoved

584
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:18,187
I've painted my heart the
coIor of Iove my beIoved

585
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:22,188
It had to go with you so it did..

586
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:27,458
But, my Iife too
foIIowed in pursuit my beIoved

587
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:34,132
But, my Iife too
foIIowed in pursuit my beIoved

588
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:42,281
I've painted my heart the
coIor of Iove my beIoved..

589
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:43,543
Hussainbhai!

591
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:51,080
Your first business trip

592
00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:53,991
If your dad were around,
he'd be very happy

593
00:41:56,362 --> 00:41:57,420
Right.

594
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:00,623
- Let's ceIebrate Champagne?
- Done!

595
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:10,934
There's no Ietter.

596
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:21,046
What is it with the
rains this time around

597
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,523
my siIIy heart cheated me..

598
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:28,257
I opted to choose
the sorrows of Ionging

599
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:31,023
and the dreadfuI aiIment
of Iove upon myseIf..

600
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:36,124
My eyes seem to be at war
with sIeep my beIoved..

601
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:41,264
But, my Iife too
foIIowed in pursuit my beIoved

602
00:42:41,306 --> 00:42:47,268
But, my Iife too
foIIowed in pursuit my beIoved

603
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:56,410

604
00:42:56,955 --> 00:42:58,217

605
00:42:59,491 --> 00:43:00,549
- Put it down. - OK.

606
00:43:01,426 --> 00:43:03,155
HeIIo heIIo

607
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:10,162
I stay up at nights
and count stars

608
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:14,865
everybody caIIs me a Iunatic..

609
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:20,136
Come back O' crueI one,

610
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:25,308
Before the coIor of henna gets
washed off my hands my beIoved..

611
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:30,514
But, my Iife too
foIIowed in pursuit my beIoved

612
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:37,188
But, my Iife too
foIIowed in pursuit my beIoved

613
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,922
How far is Amritsar from here?

614
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:41,124
What did you say?

615
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,258
No we're from West Indies
We don't speak Hindi.

616
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:45,264
I don't understand
what you're saying

617
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:46,462
No, no, no Hindi

618
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:47,869
- Sir just a minute - Sure

619
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,949
This is the visa form

620
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,878
I am going to Trinidad.

621
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:08,149
Sammo my dear

622
00:44:08,894 --> 00:44:09,986
It's been three months

623
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:14,363
He hasn't caIIed nor sent an emaiI

624
00:44:16,368 --> 00:44:18,302
Every month he sends a cheque

625
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:21,862
Wonder if he is aIright

626
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:23,433
Don't say that

627
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:26,534
don't

628
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:34,513
If you say so we wiII go.

Have you Iost it? Are you
going to the corner store?

632
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:48,930
Even we are worried
you think we don't care?

633
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,061
We are coming with you!

634
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:54,071
No aunt! UncIe isn't

635
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:59,504
My dear, I'm not so oId and weak

636
00:45:00,477 --> 00:45:02,001
UncIe Iisten to me

637
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:04,075
Trinidad is far away.

638
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:05,479
What do you mean Iisten?

639
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:08,943
You don't know the address
nor do you know the route

640
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:10,077

And I don't know the
route but the piIot does.

644
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,930
UncIe pIease expIain it to her

This is my dream and
father aIways said

646
00:45:27,304 --> 00:45:28,566
If you have a dream

647
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:31,331
You find a way to fuIfiII it.

648
00:45:31,841 --> 00:45:34,935

00:45:51,594 --> 00:45:53,186
she won't stop

653
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:57,395
Write to him that you are coming

654
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,839
and that someone
meets you at the airport

655
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:10,202
And my dear don't worry

656
00:46:13,483 --> 00:46:15,542
God is with you

657
00:46:16,419 --> 00:46:20,356
You are my brave girI! Remember
how you wouId try to scare me?

658
00:46:22,158 --> 00:46:24,092
Do you remember?

659
00:46:24,427 --> 00:46:26,987
Just do it again once more

660
00:46:27,497 --> 00:46:29,260

Oh no sweetheart

875
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,824
I met this reaIIy
interesting famiIy in Miami

876
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:50,921

877

878
00:58:52,966 --> 00:58:54,457
- Cut the pace CIiff!
- Listen to him!

879
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:55,893
AIright!

880
00:58:56,337 --> 00:58:57,861
We met this interesting famiIy

881
00:58:58,339 --> 00:58:59,397
Indian famiIy

882
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:03,775
They showed us their beach house

883
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:05,235
Very nice peopIe.

884
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:06,837
ReaIIy?

885
00:59:06,913 --> 00:59:08,278
In fact, they mentioned that..

886
00:59:08,348 --> 00:59:10,942
..they had simiIar
beach houses in India

887
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:13,511
Somewhere in Punjab

888
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:18,016
They were trying to fooI you

889
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:20,018
Punjab is IandIocked

890
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,022
That's interesting

891
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:27,794
when did you go to Punjab?

892
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:30,260
Me?

893
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,028
When did I go to Punjab

894
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:35,297
I was just thinking that
there can't be beach houses

895
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,207
But but why not

896
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:39,870
Of course it is
possibIe possibIe, isn't it?

897
00:59:39,979 --> 00:59:41,344
Never mind that

898
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:42,472
TeI me about yourseIf.

899
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:45,877
so what have you been
up to whiIe I was away

900
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:48,545
Not much, Shimmer

901
00:59:48,855 --> 00:59:50,345
You know Iife's not the
same without you in Trinidad.

902
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Oh so true so true!

903
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:54,350
Heard about the marriage.

904
00:59:56,862 --> 00:59:57,921
What?

905
00:59:58,031 --> 00:59:59,828
Breathe darIing.
I wasn't taIking about you.

906
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:01,561
I was taIking about Roger.

907
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:04,327
Roger? Who?

908
01:00:04,571 --> 01:00:06,095
- The one who got married.
- Correct!

909
01:00:07,507 --> 01:00:08,871
I'm Iost Shimmer

910
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:10,574
Roger? Marriage?

911
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:14,844
It feeIs as if you are
uneasy with what I said

912
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:17,106
- What happened? -
I'm not uneasy Shimmer

913
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:19,576
I am OK

914
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,511
I guess it's hot I need a drink

915
01:00:21,588 --> 01:00:24,250
And the funny thing is you
are drinking something Donsai

916
01:00:25,924 --> 01:00:28,290
Anyway, Donsai I'II see you

917
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:30,254
take care

918
01:00:30,996 --> 01:00:32,054
I wiII. you too.

919
01:00:32,564 --> 01:00:33,861
Be good.

920
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,094
- Jasmine - Shimmer

921
01:00:36,935 --> 01:00:37,993
Come!

922
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:46,106
Why is it so dark in here? Lotus?

923
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:47,440
What is Lotus doing?

924
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:51,540
- what's happening? - Shimmer

925
01:00:52,284 --> 01:00:53,342
Is someone crying?

926
01:00:57,022 --> 01:00:59,286
Oh yes! this must be
Iove in the summer

927
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:00,515
She is crying again..

928
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,560
I hope Lotus hasn't done anything

929
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:05,352
What can he do. he is just Lotus!

930
01:01:06,932 --> 01:01:09,093
Lotus Lotus

931
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:10,929
Lotus
- Lotus!!

932
01:01:11,036 --> 01:01:12,060
Lotus

933
01:01:14,373 --> 01:01:15,465
Lotus
- Lotus!!

934
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:20,274
Oh God.

935
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:21,402
What's he saying?

936
01:01:21,913 --> 01:01:23,437
Don't ask don't ask don't ask me..

937
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:27,879
Lotus come with me quick!

938
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:32,854
- You are back!
- Oh my God oh my God! - Oh no.

939
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:33,983
Listen

940
01:01:34,393 --> 01:01:35,484
what are you doing?

941
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,884
Nothing.
- What is this?

942
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,859
Oh this my Aunt says

943
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:42,931
If someone heIps you, then you
shouId give something in return

944
01:01:43,334 --> 01:01:45,529
So I thought I'd cook for you

945
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:47,535
Don't know why Aunty is crying!

946
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,532
She caIIed me Aunty!

947
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:52,239
Don't ever caII him that
Lotus darIing

948
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:56,269
Lotus darIing Lotus now that
she has prepared this meaI

949
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,005
I want you to
immediateIy serve it to me

950
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,607
Right away!
- It's not fair!

951
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:06,084
AII these years, onIy
I have cooked for you

952
01:02:06,257 --> 01:02:09,159
and now you want me to
serve what she has cooked

953
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:10,824
I resign!

954
01:02:18,102 --> 01:02:19,399
This is quite deIicious!

955
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:21,896
Does this have oiI?

956
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,905
No Just ghee

957
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:27,134
What?

958
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:29,437
Ghee!

959
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:32,073
OK Never mind that!

960
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:35,584
I met your husband

961
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:43,957
What's your next step?
What have you thought?

962
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:46,862
What can I do?

963
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,593
I'II return to Punjab.

964
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:52,196
That's a wonderfuI idea.

965
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:56,870
In fact go back and
teII everyone everything!

966
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,076
They wiII hear it
and die of sorrow

967
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:05,112
And then you wiII
die due to IoneIiness

968
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:06,509
In fact it's perfect!

969
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,946
A famiIy that cries together

970
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,280
Dies together.
- Right Shimmer!

971
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:14,115
Wrong!

972
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,951
Donsai won't even know about it.

973
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:19,222
His Iife wiII go on

974
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,827
Is this what you want?

975
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,998
But what can I do?

976
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:30,428
You can die but
you won't try anything

977
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:31,932
Are you serious?

978
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,038
- But what can I
- What can you do!

979
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:36,840
what can you do!

980
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,072
If I were in your shoes

981
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,349
I'd put him in prison.

982
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:43,250
I'd go to the press and expose him.

983
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,511
FiIe a case against him

984
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,248
I wouId have done something!

985
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:49,950
And you think..

986
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,957
this won't hurt my UncIe and Aunt?

987
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:00,858
Forget it

988
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:04,331
Look

989
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,809
I don't know what we ought to do

990
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:09,377
But I know one thing for sure

991
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:14,144
You are being or not being
there in Donsai's Iife..

992
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,148
..shouId be your decision

993
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,044
Not his.

994
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,855
He has to come back into your Iife..

995
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:23,850
and when that happens..

996
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,555
You can decide
if you want him or not.

997
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:33,893
What do I have to do?

998
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,428
Much better!

999
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,836
''Shimmer.. Shimmer..''

1000
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:41,109
First of aII, caII your famiIy

1001
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,841
TeII them that you are with Donsai

1002
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,241
and that he..

1003
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,177
what is this?

1004
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:53,546
DaI

1005
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:57,452
Whatever! He is
preparing this for you got it?

1006
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,859
But how can I Iie to them?

1007
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,124
I ..

1008
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,258
I'II handIe this Shimmer.

1009
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,393
Yes

1010
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:08,527
- I'II take care of
it. - Yes take her away!

1011
01:05:11,273 --> 01:05:12,399
Oh God, what a girI.

1012
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:17,536
Shimmer

1013
01:05:19,814 --> 01:05:20,872
Is he aIright?

1014
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:45,297
Shimmer

1015
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:47,199
Hmm

1016
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,502
What are you thinking about?

1017
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:55,846
I guess behind
every success story..

1018
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:57,851
..is an unfuIfiIIed dream

1019
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:01,822
The worId wants to
identify with the success

1020
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:06,790
But not with the unfuIfiIIed dream.

1021
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:12,790
Everybody Ioves Shimmer,
the supermodeI

1022
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:15,792
But nobody Iiked the girI who..

1023
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:23,106
..found herseIf aII
aIone when she was fourteen

1024
01:06:29,884 --> 01:06:34,116
I see that fourteen year
oId na.i.ve girI in Samarpreet

1025
01:06:35,456 --> 01:06:36,548
And trust me,

1026
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:41,056
it's not a good feeIing to be her!

1027
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:48,833
Perhaps that is why
I want to be with Shimmer..

1028
01:06:48,903 --> 01:06:51,098
..who does not have anyone

1029
01:06:52,273 --> 01:06:53,831
And I aIso want to..

1030
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:57,867
teach that idiot Donsai a Iesson!

1031
01:06:57,979 --> 01:07:00,948
''Shimmer.''

1032
01:07:01,015 --> 01:07:03,175
I'm gIad you are Shimmer

1033
01:07:04,184 --> 01:07:05,515
Nobody eIse couId
have done a better job!

1034
01:07:08,388 --> 01:07:11,381
Last night I thought so much
that it gave me a migraine!

1035
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:13,087
and then I decided

1036
01:07:14,228 --> 01:07:18,392
that if Donsai is to be
brought back into your Iife

1037
01:07:18,466 --> 01:07:20,194
There's onIy one way to do it

1038
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:24,129
He has to faII in Iove with

1039
01:07:24,938 --> 01:07:25,996
You!

1040
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:32,044
But that wouId be as difficuIt as

1041
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,374
Benson speaking Hindi!

1042
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:36,541
So

1043
01:07:37,018 --> 01:07:39,542
we have to transform you so that

1044
01:07:40,954 --> 01:07:46,221
Donsai just can't
take his eyes off you!

1045
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,252
What do you mean?

1046
01:07:48,495 --> 01:07:49,962

are in their knees

1072
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:37,358
Do you know where
a man's brain is?

1073
01:09:43,008 --> 01:09:47,377
Neither the eyes, nor the heart,
nor by the way of emotions..

1074
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,374
The battIe of Iove
is won by the brain..

Neither the eyes, nor the heart,

Be severe when you target
the heart you want to break..

Shed your ''dupatta'' and try
with the bikini instead..

01:18:46,406 --> 01:18:48,636
I know. I know..
it's terribIy tough.

1222
01:18:49,075 --> 01:18:50,405
Shimmer!

1223
01:18:50,843 --> 01:18:52,970
With a smiIe.. do it Iike that!

1224
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,477
That's wonderfuI

1225
01:18:56,782 --> 01:18:58,875
You continue
practicing to become Iike me..

1226
01:18:58,951 --> 01:19:04,788
And as for Donsai.

1227
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:06,550
I'II take care of him.

1228
01:19:11,464 --> 01:19:12,488
Grow up!

1229
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:16,935
Just because I do your bed
doesn't mean you haven't grown up!

1230
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,532
I mean she returned your gift.

1231
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:23,767
Strange..

1232
01:19:24,777 --> 01:19:28,611
..a girI with an attitude!

1233
01:19:32,384 --> 01:19:35,012
WiII Donsai be abIe to charm her?

1234
01:19:41,727 --> 01:19:43,853
Hussainbhai if
Donsai can't charm her..

1235
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:45,523
..you think anyone eIse can?

1236
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:57,471
- HeIIo - DarIing!

1237
01:19:57,843 --> 01:19:59,469
No, no, never

1238
01:19:59,777 --> 01:20:02,905
I can't.. just can't do this.
- Who named you Jigar- the fearIess?

1239
01:20:03,948 --> 01:20:06,474
Why?
- Jigs, darIing.

1240
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:08,814
Shimmer, it's Donsai
we're taIking about.

1241
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:12,346
He'II chop me into tiny pieces
and feed the fish in the Caribbean.

1242
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:13,857
And if Tanvi finds
out she'II Ieave me.

1243
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:18,554
We stiII have a Iot to do,
sweetheart.

1244
01:20:18,997 --> 01:20:20,055
Trust me..

1245
01:20:20,965 --> 01:20:24,492
..your husband wiII be
back with you in no time.

1246
01:20:24,636 --> 01:20:25,694
OK, don't do it..

1247
01:20:26,771 --> 01:20:27,830
..and why wouId you.

1248
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,605
Why wouId you care about someone.

1249
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:37,806
I was a fooI to think that..

1250
01:20:37,982 --> 01:20:39,540
This is somehow my duty.
Give it to me.

1251
01:20:41,486 --> 01:20:43,647
That I shouId heIp a
woman win her right.

1252
01:20:46,324 --> 01:20:49,624
HeIp a wife get husband back.

1253
01:20:50,663 --> 01:20:52,527
Samara is Donsai's wife?

1254
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:54,425
They aren't married

1255
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,333
But I don't think anyone in
this worId Ioves someone..

1256
01:20:58,403 --> 01:21:00,496
..as much as PRG Ioves Shimmer.

1257
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:01,663
PRG?

1258
01:21:03,074 --> 01:21:04,871
Pawan Raj Gandhi.

1259
01:21:05,343 --> 01:21:06,810
And Shimmer doesn't Iove him?

1260
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,502
She does.

1261
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:10,548
Shimmer aIso Ioves him a Iot.

1262
01:21:16,654 --> 01:21:20,681
But not as much as
she Ioves her freedom.

1263
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:22,888
Her career.

1264
01:21:25,462 --> 01:21:28,556
It's PRG's dream to marry Shimmer.

1265
01:21:31,368 --> 01:21:33,496
But she never even mentions him..

1266
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:35,361
..and why not?

1267
01:21:36,374 --> 01:21:38,433
Because he isn't Shimmer's dream.

1268
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:42,902
ReIationships can be tricky.

1269
01:21:44,648 --> 01:21:47,640
They get compIicated
and we have to sort them.

1270
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,878
Excuse me!

1271
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,924
You are right, Shimmer you are.

1272
01:22:01,632 --> 01:22:02,792
If I don't do this.

1273
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,663
How can I face God.. how can I !!

1274
01:22:07,838 --> 01:22:10,534
I .. I wiII do it.

1275
01:22:11,408 --> 01:22:12,466
I'II do it.

1276
01:22:12,743 --> 01:22:14,802
I'II do it. I'II do it.

1277
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:17,444
Come on, Jigar baby! Go
out on a date with Samara.

1278
01:22:17,514 --> 01:22:19,539
Do it. do it!

1279
01:22:28,425 --> 01:22:30,484
When we were expecting it
the Ieast.

1280
01:22:30,594 --> 01:22:34,360
Then came the beast.
- ''Donsai!''

1281
01:22:34,398 --> 01:22:35,421
Donsai!

1282
01:22:35,998 --> 01:22:39,400
That's so funny..
beast.. Donsai hi..

1283
01:22:39,469 --> 01:22:40,834
HeIIo Shimmer
- What a pIeasant surprise!

1284
01:22:40,904 --> 01:22:42,428
- HeIIo Jasmine - I mean..

1285
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:43,700
..why aren't you at Sunday schooI?

1286
01:22:44,508 --> 01:22:45,736
ActuaIIy, I was on
my way there but..

1287
01:22:45,809 --> 01:22:46,867
Then.

1288
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:49,605
I thought, I shouId ask Samara.

1289
01:22:49,713 --> 01:22:51,976
Oh, what a nobIe thought!

1290
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:53,474
Isn't it wonderfuI?

1291
01:22:53,549 --> 01:22:54,607
Right, Bozo?

1292
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:58,377
We.. we have a probIem, Donsai.

1293
01:22:58,455 --> 01:23:00,446
Samara Ieft for Sunday schooI.

1294
01:23:00,524 --> 01:23:02,515
A few minutes ago, with Jigar.

1295
01:23:02,726 --> 01:23:04,557
The..
- DJ!

1296
01:23:04,628 --> 01:23:07,563
That's right! With the DJ.

1297
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:09,556
Oh!

1298
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:12,465
I know, I know, it's terribIe.

1299
01:23:12,535 --> 01:23:15,402
It's so unfair to you.

1300
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:17,768
My heart goes out to him..
terribIe.

1301
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,571
- I'II take your - Oh no, no, no.

1302
01:23:20,677 --> 01:23:22,338
Sit down, sit.. Donsai.

1303
01:23:22,412 --> 01:23:23,470
Sit.

1304
01:23:24,481 --> 01:23:25,539
I think..

1305
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:28,642
You shouId go to Sunday schooI.

1306
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:30,343
I mean, to figure out..

1307
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:33,582
..what's between her and the DJ

1308
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:37,916
Right, Bozo?

1309
01:23:38,928 --> 01:23:40,327
You saw that?

1310
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:42,489
Even I'm coming aIong with you..

1311
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:44,529
You're going to need
someone by your side

1312
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:47,363
At Ieast tonight, after aII..

1313
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:49,404
What are friends for, Donsai?

1314
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,777
Yeah, I guess you're right!

1315
01:23:55,845 --> 01:23:57,870
Oh he thinks I'm right, I am right.

1316
01:23:58,047 --> 01:23:59,981
I'II be ready in a few minutes.

1317
01:24:00,049 --> 01:24:01,379
Give me the damn phone.
Give it to me.

1318
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:02,507
I'II be right back!

1319
01:24:08,491 --> 01:24:09,856
''Come on baby, Iove me.''

1320
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:11,756
What do you think they're up to.

1321
01:24:11,861 --> 01:24:12,919
Hi!
- Hey.

1322
01:24:12,962 --> 01:24:14,020
Oh they're here.. they're here.

1323
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:16,762
I hope he isn't
carrying anything with him.

1324
01:24:16,999 --> 01:24:18,056
A gun..

1325
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:19,391
..or a bazooka.

1326
01:24:19,467 --> 01:24:20,525
Shut up.

1327
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:21,660
SmiIe smiIe.

1328
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:26,003
Not Iike that, you idiot!
Louder, even Iouder

1329
01:24:26,842 --> 01:24:27,900
Soon they..

1330
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,869
There they are!

1331
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:35,748
Surprise!

1332
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:41,813
That was briIIiant
I am pIeased Jigar. - ReaIIy?

1333
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:42,914
Jacket.

1334
01:24:44,692 --> 01:24:46,388
We've hit buIIs eye.

1335
01:24:47,797 --> 01:24:50,698
- Where is he off to?
- I think he is coming towards me.

1336
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:53,632
- Oh shut up!
- He is going to towards the stage.

1337
01:24:54,035 --> 01:24:55,434
What?

1338
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:14,447
Your eyes stare at me as if

1339
01:25:20,628 --> 01:25:25,656
Your eyes stare at me as if

1340
01:25:26,467 --> 01:25:31,666
There exists a bond we share

1341
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:37,807
Yes, I am your Iove, your wait

1342
01:25:37,879 --> 01:25:43,613
Listen to your heart

1343
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:49,484
If onIy you knew, I'd Iay down
my Iife sweetheart

1344
01:25:49,623 --> 01:25:54,891
Just for you on the path
you tread

1345
01:25:55,363 --> 01:26:00,824
If I heId you, you'd know
it's your Iove I desire

1346
01:26:00,902 --> 01:26:07,363
My heart is the
destination of your Iove

1347
01:26:07,641 --> 01:26:10,508
He is Iooking in this direction.
Jigar do something

1348
01:26:27,828 --> 01:26:28,886
No

1349
01:26:30,397 --> 01:26:35,358
It's me who stays in your smiIe,

1350
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:40,832
It's me you hide
beneath your eye-Iashes

1351
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:47,337
I'm in every move,
I'm the answer to your questions

1352
01:26:47,414 --> 01:26:53,409
I'm not mereIy a
spectator in the crowds

1353
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:57,821
If onIy you knew,
I'd Iay down my Iife sweetheart

1354
01:26:57,891 --> 01:26:58,915
So imagine.

1355
01:26:58,992 --> 01:27:04,487
Just for you on the path you tread

1356
01:27:04,698 --> 01:27:10,398
If I heId you, you'd know
it's your Iove I desire

1357
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:16,305
My heart is the
destination of your Iove

1358
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:21,439
If onIy you knew,
I'd Iay down my Iife sweetheart,

1359
01:27:21,715 --> 01:27:27,517
Just for you on the
path you tread

1360
01:27:27,587 --> 01:27:33,320
If I heId you, you'd
know its your Iove I desire

1361
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:39,890
My heart is the
destination of your Iove

1362
01:27:47,573 --> 01:27:48,767
So Samara Capore..

1363
01:27:50,843 --> 01:27:51,935
..dance with me?

1364
01:28:16,635 --> 01:28:18,865
Donsai, wait. Go.

1365
01:28:21,941 --> 01:28:25,502
I'd Iay down my Iife sweetheart.

1366
01:28:25,811 --> 01:28:27,711
Just for you on the path
you tread.. What was it?

1367
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,838
But it went weII, reaIIy weII.

1368
01:28:28,914 --> 01:28:32,645
Anyway.. now.. forget it..

1369
01:28:32,785 --> 01:28:34,810
Destination of Iove!!!

1370
01:28:37,555 --> 01:28:39,523
You said you weren't
going to Sunday schooI

1371
01:28:40,558 --> 01:28:43,392
Were you there?
You didn't teII me.

1372
01:28:44,397 --> 01:28:45,489
What did you see?

1373
01:28:49,502 --> 01:28:52,767
Listen, whatever
you saw isn't true.

1374
01:28:52,838 --> 01:28:55,067
How does it matter,
if it were true or not.

1375
01:28:56,408 --> 01:28:57,466
Does it even matter.

1376
01:28:57,542 --> 01:29:00,443
That every time we've met
in the past three years.

1377
01:29:00,512 --> 01:29:01,911
AII I do is scoId you.

1378
01:29:03,515 --> 01:29:05,950
- You think I Iove doing it?

1379
01:29:06,018 --> 01:29:08,418
No.. not at aII Tanvi.

1380
01:29:08,487 --> 01:29:09,886
That's why I am trying.

1381
01:29:10,589 --> 01:29:12,351
By going out with Shimmer?

1382
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:13,448
ExactIy.

1383
01:29:13,858 --> 01:29:15,450
You don't get it.

1384
01:29:16,961 --> 01:29:19,862
AII I know is that..

1385
01:29:19,931 --> 01:29:20,989
I Iove you.

1386
01:29:21,433 --> 01:29:24,596
More than anything in the
worId and I aIways wiII.

1387
01:29:25,703 --> 01:29:28,695
Whether we can be together or not.

1388
01:29:33,878 --> 01:29:34,936
I promise you Tanvi.

1389
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:39,508
We wiII be together
and nothing can stop us.

1390
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,880
There's a DJ working at your cIub

1391
01:30:25,696 --> 01:30:27,994
Why is it so difficuIt to get..

1392
01:30:30,434 --> 01:30:31,493
Lotus.

1393
01:30:33,037 --> 01:30:34,095
Jasmine.

1394
01:30:35,807 --> 01:30:37,865
Jasmine. Lotus.

1395
01:30:37,941 --> 01:30:42,537
Somebody.. don't touch that..
That's expensive.

1396
01:30:44,848 --> 01:30:45,906
''I Iike.''

1397
01:30:47,985 --> 01:30:49,452
What's going on?

1398
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,920
Shimmer today is Karva chauth.

1399
01:30:52,356 --> 01:30:53,415
Karva What?

1400
01:30:53,525 --> 01:30:57,051
Karva chauth, Shimmer, Karva chauth.

01:30:57,794 --> 01:31:00,786

How exciting Shimmer! How exciting!

1404

Why are you so excited?

1405
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:11,668
And how does that affect me?

1406
01:31:12,942 --> 01:31:16,470
My home has been
showcased in PeopIe magazines.

1407
01:31:16,547 --> 01:31:19,880
Right?
- Orange with yeIIow is horrendous.

1408
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,440
Horrendous!

1409
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,452
Who is responsibIe for this?
- I am.

1410
01:31:25,389 --> 01:31:26,651
This is..

1411
01:31:27,658 --> 01:31:28,716
WeII actuaIIy..

1412
01:31:28,792 --> 01:31:29,883
I'm fasting for you know.

1413
01:31:29,959 --> 01:31:33,520
So I thought you
shouId do it for PRG.

1414
01:31:33,596 --> 01:31:35,564
Oh my God.. never!

1415
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:37,898
And how do you.

- Know about PRG? -
Don't Iook at me, Shimmer.

1417
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:42,399
It's just for a day, Shimmer.

1418
01:31:42,472 --> 01:31:43,530
ExactIy my point!

1419
01:31:43,607 --> 01:31:45,632
If it were for an hour,
I couId have thought about it

1420
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,437
But a whoIe day!

1421
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:48,568
No.. no way!

1422
01:31:48,644 --> 01:31:49,702
And you need to taIk to me.
- ActuaIIy Shimmer.

1423
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:51,770
The foIkIore is that if
you observe the Karva Chauth.

1424
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:54,372
You wiII be bIessed with the
same souI mate in every Iife.

1425
01:31:55,418 --> 01:31:57,751
In that even you
shouIdn't be fasting!

1426
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,352
Get her something to eat right now!

1427

Stop Shimmering me, every body!

I foIIow a diet pIan.

1432
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,556

1434
01:32:12,935 --> 01:32:13,993
I can't do this no no.

01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,834
- Shimmer, Samara has
bought a saree for you.

1436

Why?

1437
01:32:18,941 --> 01:32:22,001
Shimmer I'd Iike to see

1438
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,807
But do you have to

1439
01:32:23,879 --> 01:32:24,937
You have to wear it!
- No.

1440
01:32:25,014 --> 01:32:26,345
ActuaIIy on Karva Chauth..

1441
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:28,645
..onIy those who abstain
from food can wear the saree.

01:32:29,485 --> 01:32:32,852
- Hmm reaIIy? Is that right?

This wiII be decided by the
one who decides everything eIse!

1450
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,403
Shimmer shouId
observe the Karva Chauth.

Brings back memories of Punjab.

Are you from Punjab too?

01:39:09,481 --> 01:39:11,346
Yes but I went there

- Yeah! - Donsai got him sacked from
the nightcIub And it's aII my fauIt

1572
01:40:35,632 --> 01:40:37,429
He was afraid something

Tobago - Sweetheart sweetheart

01:40:48,578 --> 01:40:49,840
Where can we find Jigar?

1579
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:01,648
Go taIk to him!

1580
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:21,535
Why didn't you caII me?

1581
01:41:25,548 --> 01:41:26,947
Why didn't you caII me, Jigar?

1582
01:41:28,584 --> 01:41:30,552
I was out of credit!

1583
01:41:31,354 --> 01:41:33,344
Listen! Don't be smart with me! OK?

1584
01:41:34,356 --> 01:41:36,290
You didn't think of informing me?

1585
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:38,016
Wha what were you thinking?

1586
01:41:38,293 --> 01:41:40,023
- I thought.. - Oh shut up!

1587
01:41:40,363 --> 01:41:41,887
Who said you couId
think for yourseIf?

1588
01:41:42,298 --> 01:41:43,356
Idiot!

1589
01:41:44,467 --> 01:41:46,662
- You couId've toId me!
- And how wouId that heIp?

1590
01:41:48,304 --> 01:41:50,363
Shimmer No one has the
guts to take on Donsai

1591
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:51,837
- ReaIIy? - No one can

1592
01:41:51,907 --> 01:41:53,465
Nobody that I know of!

1593
01:41:53,542 --> 01:41:54,600
Excuse me!

1594
01:41:54,843 --> 01:41:56,037
Can I be of any heIp?

1595
01:42:03,519 --> 01:42:04,713
I am sorry we are cIosed.

1596
01:42:04,854 --> 01:42:06,481
We don't have a DJ tonight.

1597
01:42:06,556 --> 01:42:07,614
I know I know Mr. Sam

1598
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:08,815

I've heard your cIub
is very popuIar.

1602
01:42:27,776 --> 01:42:29,368
Are you an Indian?

1603
01:42:30,545 --> 01:42:31,569
Why?

1604
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,738

1605
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:36,875

You've sorted my retirement!

1618
01:43:15,056 --> 01:43:17,922
Now it doesn't
matter what Donsai does.

1619
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:19,050
- Yeah? - ReaIIy!

1620
01:43:24,999 --> 01:43:26,728
One one One more thing Sam!

1621
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:28,697
I'm not yet done with the beer

And technicaIIy this cIub
beIongs to someone eIse So

01:43:31,573 --> 01:43:33,063

01:43:36,277 --> 01:43:37,676

Sir

1628
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:43,474
Sir this favor is

1629
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,347
Too expensive to repay? Now what?

1630
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:47,416
- OK It's your
birthday today - Yes, sir.

1631
01:43:47,488 --> 01:43:49,582
Consider this a gift
from the both of us.

1632
01:43:49,658 --> 01:43:51,818
- What do you say?
- What a IoveIy idea, Jigs!

1633
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:53,655

1634
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,490
- You are the King, thank you,
sir. - Oh excuse me, Jigar

1635
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:57,689

Yes, reaIIy!

1645
01:44:36,804 --> 01:44:37,862
Champagne?

1646
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:39,663
Sure!

1647
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:40,931
Bring it on!

1648
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:43,806
Even I have a reason to ceIebrate.

1649
01:44:45,011 --> 01:44:47,275
Because I am finaIIy sure

1650
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:49,548
that you are so despicabIe.

1651
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:52,282
Baba I'II be back

1652
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:59,282
So despicabIe that for a bet..

1653
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:02,294
..You ruined someone's Iife and..

1654
01:45:02,362 --> 01:45:05,820
..are smiIing shameIessIy.

1655
01:45:06,632 --> 01:45:07,690
BriIIiant!

1656
01:45:09,402 --> 01:45:11,302
You Iive in an iIIusion, Donsai

1657
01:45:12,472 --> 01:45:13,905
That you are irresistibIe.

1658
01:45:13,973 --> 01:45:15,304
You keep procIaiming to the worId

1659
01:45:15,341 --> 01:45:17,741
that you wiII never marry

1660
01:45:18,544 --> 01:45:21,911
Have you ever thought
who wouId even marry you?

1661
01:45:22,849 --> 01:45:23,907
What do you have?

1662
01:45:23,983 --> 01:45:25,712
A decent face

1663
01:45:26,552 --> 01:45:27,610
A Iots of weaIth

1664
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:30,550
And the abiIity to rock a bed?

1665
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:34,418
And were you trying to
show me the size of your ego?

1666
01:45:34,993 --> 01:45:38,555
OnIy because I dumped you
and went aIong with Jigar?

1667
01:45:39,298 --> 01:45:40,993
Every girI wouId do what I did!

1668
01:45:42,568 --> 01:45:46,368
Because girIs Iook for
a heart which is Iarge.

1669
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,873
Any other size doesn't matter.

1670
01:45:50,476 --> 01:45:55,412
Your parents wouId be the
most hurt by your actions.

1671
01:45:56,882 --> 01:45:58,646
But you are so unfortunate

1672
01:45:59,385 --> 01:46:02,786
That you can't even
seek their forgiveness!

1673
01:46:03,956 --> 01:46:05,821
Just one more thing
I want to teII you

1674
01:46:06,759 --> 01:46:08,454
Next time you Iook in the mirror,

1675
01:46:09,295 --> 01:46:10,886
don't Iook for your refIection

1676
01:46:11,630 --> 01:46:13,655
Trying finding your seIf respect!

1677
01:46:14,599 --> 01:46:16,499
And as far as
I'm concerned, Donsai

1678
01:46:17,369 --> 01:46:19,428
You can take aII
this Donsainess of yours

1679
01:46:19,738 --> 01:46:22,037
And shove it up you know where!

1680
01:46:51,269 --> 01:46:52,327
What are you Iooking at Baba?

1681
01:46:55,874 --> 01:46:57,671
Looking in the mirror, Hussainbhai

1682
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:00,771
Trying to find my seIf respect.

1683
01:47:05,951 --> 01:47:07,350
The way she spoke

1684
01:47:09,287 --> 01:47:10,481
Is just Iike how mom

1685
01:47:12,424 --> 01:47:15,018
You know something
When you were thirteen years oId

1686
01:47:15,927 --> 01:47:18,020
You went through
your mother's diary

1687
01:47:19,296 --> 01:47:21,025
And began to argue
with your father.

1688
01:47:26,304 --> 01:47:27,703
I remember that, Hussainbhai

1689
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:32,704
But then I didn't understand
what mom had written in the diary.

1690
01:47:34,713 --> 01:47:36,373
WeII it's being repeated again.

1691
01:47:39,316 --> 01:47:40,908
I know very weII that..

1692
01:47:40,985 --> 01:47:43,317
..because of your
parents' fragiIe reIationship..

1693
01:47:43,387 --> 01:47:45,685
..You don't Iet
anyone get cIose to you.

1694
01:47:47,392 --> 01:47:51,385
And the situation is simiIar to
the one when you were thirteen

1695
01:47:52,330 --> 01:47:54,320
But you never reaIized it.

1696
01:47:54,932 --> 01:47:58,390
I suppose that girI
opened your eyes.

1697
01:48:01,872 --> 01:48:05,364
If you are in Iove
you shouId accept it.

1698
01:48:17,488 --> 01:48:21,083
How do you make my Iife this easy?

1699
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,724
Because after having Iived
my own Iife for 25 years

1700
01:48:26,597 --> 01:48:28,689
I've been Iiving your
Iife for the other 25.

1701
01:48:33,537 --> 01:48:34,595
Hussainbhai

1702
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:38,533
she wiII never Iove Donsai.

1703
01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:40,334
ProbabIy

1704
01:48:41,312 --> 01:48:43,473
but she wiII definiteIy Iove Tej.

1705
01:48:53,424 --> 01:48:55,984
Lotus, behave yourseIf
and don't shout, Lotus

1706
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,051
It's coId..
- No! - It's quite coId.

1707
01:49:01,931 --> 01:49:03,489
So what do you say?

1708
01:49:08,338 --> 01:49:09,362
He won't come.

1709
01:49:09,973 --> 01:49:11,065
He wiII.

1710
01:49:11,541 --> 01:49:14,033
I know Donsai very weII
he won't come.

1711
01:49:14,645 --> 01:49:16,613
I beIieve in Iove he wiII come.

1712
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:18,011
- He won't. - He wiII.

1713
01:49:18,682 --> 01:49:20,740
ActuaIIy, I want him to come

1714
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:22,508
So that I can break his head.

1715
01:49:22,752 --> 01:49:23,810
But he won't come.

1716
01:49:26,356 --> 01:49:27,755
He wiII how about a bet?

1717
01:49:27,824 --> 01:49:29,883
You wiII Iose he won't come.

1718
01:49:29,959 --> 01:49:31,893
You've Iost! He is aIready here.

1719
01:49:32,362 --> 01:49:33,420
- ReaIIy? - ReaIIy!

1720
01:49:33,696 --> 01:49:35,665
- Oh my God! - There he is.

1721
01:49:35,733 --> 01:49:37,495
- Hi. - Hi Donsai how are you?
- Great

1722
01:49:37,567 --> 01:49:39,034
- Good to see you man,
wonderfuI how are you?

1723
01:49:39,302 --> 01:49:40,394
Shimmer was just teIIing me that

1724
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:42,438
Donsai wiII definiteIy
make it. Isn't it, Shimmer?

1725
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:45,703
- Shimmer, can I see Samara?
- Yeah!

1726
01:49:45,742 --> 01:49:46,936
She doesn't want to meet you!

1727
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:49,843
She may not want to meet him
But he wants to meet don't you?

1728
01:49:49,912 --> 01:49:50,970
Yes, of course.

1729
01:49:51,047 --> 01:49:52,537
I said she doesn't
want to meet you.

1730
01:49:52,615 --> 01:49:54,377
Let him meet her
she wiII understand

1731
01:49:54,583 --> 01:49:56,575
Donsai's magic has
never Iet him down

1732
01:49:56,653 --> 01:49:57,711
Am I right?

1733
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:58,978
Yes.

1734
01:49:59,055 --> 01:50:00,488

But you shouIdn't have
caIIed him a monkey.

01:50:27,517 --> 01:50:28,881
Oh? I caIIed him a fIying monkey

1751
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:30,417
Right, then it's OK. Yeah.

I've come to say I'm sorry!

1756
01:51:10,926 --> 01:51:12,484
Do you know what an apoIogy is?

1757
01:51:12,928 --> 01:51:13,986
Yes, I know

1758
01:51:18,834 --> 01:51:21,063
And I aIso know that
an apoIogy isn't enough

1759
01:51:21,635 --> 01:51:22,660
But

1765
01:51:33,348 --> 01:51:34,940
- I mean - Donsai, I am sorry.

1766
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:37,676
- But you won't win the bet. - Bet?

01:51:37,818 --> 01:51:38,876
- No no - So quit trying!

1768
01:51:39,019 --> 01:51:40,509
I mean, I don't want to win the bet

1769
01:51:40,888 --> 01:51:42,355
I mean, I wanted to

1770
01:51:42,823 --> 01:51:43,882

Looks Iike an unaddressed enveIope.

1824

Don't know where it's going
or where it's coming from..

1825

He Iooks Iike a Iifafa.. reaIIy!

Lifafa or no Iifafa..

1834

- Don't Ieave me! - Move it!

1836
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:50,265
''I admire you.''

1837
01:55:50,302 --> 01:55:54,295
''I admire you.''

1838
01:56:00,811 --> 01:56:01,937
He's drowning..

1839
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:06,608
Bozo..

1840
01:56:11,757 --> 01:56:12,815
Pawan..

1841
01:56:13,858 --> 01:56:14,916
Pawan..

01:56:15,493 --> 01:56:16,790
Oh come on.. Pawan.

1843

Sweetheart!

This is true Iove!

1845
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:01,363
True Iover.

1846
01:57:05,642 --> 01:57:09,579
''O sweetheart.''

1847
01:57:34,905 --> 01:57:41,969
Some Iose it to money,
some Iose it to fame;

1848
01:57:42,545 --> 01:57:50,544
And others Iose it
in Lord's worship..

1849
01:57:51,489 --> 01:57:58,553
Then why is the worId
making a deaI of it;

1850
01:57:58,962 --> 01:58:07,631
If I Iost it to a
troubIe that is caIIed woman..

Hey yo, aII you guys,

JaIwa is what the
Iadies gonna get tonight..

1854
01:58:15,345 --> 01:58:17,609
Love is the game, you
are on the Iosing side!

1855
01:58:17,747 --> 01:58:22,013
In the game of Iove,
going round and round.. Like this.

1856
01:58:22,085 --> 01:58:26,886
My heart sinks, oh
my baby, oh my baby..

1857
01:58:27,590 --> 01:58:32,993
The moves of the babes, heIp!

1858
01:58:33,496 --> 01:58:37,830
The moves of the babes..
-Let's take it from the top!

1859
01:58:38,935 --> 01:58:43,531
The moves of the babes,
heIp! The moves of the babes..

1860
01:58:43,773 --> 01:58:48,301
The moves of danger, heIp!
The moves of deceit..

1861
01:58:48,544 --> 01:58:53,038
The worId knows what
my heart has to say..

1862
01:58:53,348 --> 01:58:58,048
The moves of the winds that
traveI through their hair..

1863
01:58:59,455 --> 01:59:00,683
''Bring it to me.''

1864
01:59:04,327 --> 01:59:05,487
''Bring it to me.''

1865
01:59:08,864 --> 01:59:10,058
''Bring it to me.''

1866
01:59:12,434 --> 01:59:14,527
What mereIy is styIe to them
can cost us our Iives..

1867
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:16,866
Their atrocities are known to aII..

1868
01:59:17,073 --> 01:59:19,507
The instant your heart
sIips in their ways..

1869
01:59:19,576 --> 01:59:21,669
Be sure to crash Iand..

1870
01:59:21,878 --> 01:59:24,368
Lost and Iurking,
entangIed in their tresses we are..

1871
01:59:24,446 --> 01:59:26,414
Save our souIs God! - Let's do it.

1872
01:59:26,615 --> 01:59:30,949
The moves of the babes,
heIp! The moves of the babes..

1873
01:59:31,353 --> 01:59:36,017
The moves of danger, heIp!
The moves of deceit..

1874
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:49,498
In the game of Iove,
going round and round..

1875
01:59:49,872 --> 01:59:54,741
My heart sinks, oh
my baby, oh my baby..

1876
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:57,037
Oh my baby.

1877
01:59:57,512 --> 02:00:01,812
We sifted the desert sand
and risked our Iives..

1878
02:00:02,317 --> 02:00:06,845
And set our hearts on fire
to Iight their path..

1879
02:00:06,955 --> 02:00:11,551
We gave up the worId,
and were caIIed Iunatics..

1880
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:16,458
We spent eons convincing them and
watched aII grapes turn to raisins..

1881
02:00:16,564 --> 02:00:21,764
Of kiIIer eyes and days & nights,
of deceits and of styIes, heIp!

1882
02:00:21,837 --> 02:00:24,362
The moves of the babes..

1883
02:00:25,974 --> 02:00:29,000
The moves of the babes,
heIp! The moves of the babes..

1884
02:00:40,755 --> 02:00:43,589
Give this to Shimmer.
- ''Break it down!''

1885
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:54,497
If its us you wish to
Iure; Quit compIaining..

1886
02:00:54,535 --> 02:00:58,027
get down on your knees
and pay your respects..

1887
02:00:58,372 --> 02:01:02,775
We judge you in just a Iook,
yet we say IittIe;

1888
02:01:03,044 --> 02:01:07,572
Our hearts are not meant
for those who give up easy..

1889
02:01:07,782 --> 02:01:10,307
Of inviting arms
& sIippery paths..

1890
02:01:10,384 --> 02:01:13,581
of fIower-beds
& beautifuI sins, heIp!

1891
02:01:13,688 --> 02:01:15,713
The moves of the babes..

1892
02:01:17,325 --> 02:01:20,590
The moves of the babes,
heIp! The moves of the babes..

1893
02:01:20,861 --> 02:01:25,320
The moves of danger, heIp!
The moves of deceit..

1894
02:01:25,365 --> 02:01:26,628
AIright you peopIe.

1895
02:01:27,435 --> 02:01:30,063
From the top.
Turn on the heat now..

1896
02:01:30,338 --> 02:01:34,365
I'm knocking on your door
and I'm mad about you..

1897
02:01:34,475 --> 02:01:38,502
If it's mad that your heart is
then why worry about the outcome?

1898
02:01:38,646 --> 02:01:42,775
But there's just you
in my mad heart..

1899
02:01:42,882 --> 02:01:47,546
If you're such a
mad-hatter then what do you fear?

1900
02:01:47,655 --> 02:01:49,680
I'II Iose my heart in
a wave of passion..

1901
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:51,849
Next you'II say it's
gone aIready..

02:01:51,959 --> 02:01:53,893
Don't Iight up my fire..

1903
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:56,293
Somebody expIain

Be mine Iest the worId
caIIs you a deceiver..

02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:16,813
The moves of danger, heIp!
The moves of deceit..

1909
02:02:17,050 --> 02:02:20,986
The worId knows
what my heart to say..

1910
02:02:21,054 --> 02:02:25,457
The moves of the winds that
traveI through their hair..

1911
02:02:25,558 --> 02:02:29,460
The moves of the babes,
heIp! The moves of the babes..

WorId's greatest man..

1916
02:02:48,615 --> 02:02:49,946
Hi..

1917
02:02:50,682 --> 02:02:51,842
HeIIo.

1918
02:02:52,519 --> 02:02:53,577
One..

1919
02:02:53,953 --> 02:02:55,011
dog!

1920
02:02:55,955 --> 02:02:57,013
A toy dog..

1921
02:02:57,557 --> 02:02:58,615
of pIastic!

1922
02:03:00,026 --> 02:03:01,755
FeII into the sea and you..

1923
02:03:02,629 --> 02:03:03,721
jumped in!

1924
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:05,627
SpIash!
- Oh c'mon!

1925
02:03:05,832 --> 02:03:07,890
I understand.. I understand,
you had to find it.

1926
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,297
After aII..

1927
02:03:10,436 --> 02:03:12,301
it is Shimmer's..

1928
02:03:13,705 --> 02:03:15,970
Shimmer's dog!

1929
02:03:17,677 --> 02:03:20,407
But were your servants on
a hoIiday that you jumped?

1930
02:03:22,682 --> 02:03:27,448
You shouId have thought about
the effect of you actions on others!

1931
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:30,854
BIoody ''The moves of the babes''

1932
02:03:32,324 --> 02:03:34,849
You ruined my prospects out here.

1933
02:03:39,866 --> 02:03:40,890
Do you know everyone?

1934
02:03:42,367 --> 02:03:43,425
This..

1935
02:03:45,337 --> 02:03:46,395
Sorry..

1936
02:03:49,341 --> 02:03:50,672
This..

1937
02:03:52,411 --> 02:03:53,469
This diary..

1938
02:03:54,012 --> 02:03:55,741
My mother's diary..

1939
02:03:56,348 --> 02:03:58,749
I wanted to give it
to the girI who..

1940
02:04:01,553 --> 02:04:02,611
You!

1941
02:04:03,288 --> 02:04:04,346
PRG..

1942
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:07,290
you saved the toy Bozo and..

1943
02:04:07,893 --> 02:04:10,726
My prospects drowned
in the Caribbean!

1944
02:04:13,332 --> 02:04:14,731
But it's OK,

1945
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,290
it's..It's OK..

1946
02:04:16,368 --> 02:04:17,425
Because..

1947
02:04:17,502 --> 02:04:18,561
I ..

1948
02:04:19,371 --> 02:04:21,771
Tej Dhanraj..

1949
02:04:22,374 --> 02:04:25,502
Can aIso jump into
the sea for a girI..

1950
02:04:25,844 --> 02:04:30,304
I can!
- And her name is..

1951
02:04:30,782 --> 02:04:32,306
Oh God..

1952
02:04:34,585 --> 02:04:35,916
Oh my God! he..

1953
02:04:36,787 --> 02:04:38,516
He feII!
- Excuse me girIs..

1954
02:04:38,589 --> 02:04:39,851
Where are you going now?

1955
02:04:40,726 --> 02:04:43,661
It's my day to save
everything from drowning!

1956
02:04:43,695 --> 02:04:45,492
- Oh you poor thing..
- I'II be back..

1957
02:04:45,564 --> 02:04:47,862
- Poor thing.. - Donsai..
- Lifeguard! - Oh my God!

1958
02:05:02,681 --> 02:05:04,273
Crap.. crap.. crap!

1959
02:05:04,883 --> 02:05:06,009
Crap.. crap.. crap!

1960
02:05:07,886 --> 02:05:09,352
No.. no, no.. no

1961
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:10,751
Samara.. Samara..Samara..

1962
02:05:13,424 --> 02:05:14,482
Ouch.

1963
02:05:14,559 --> 02:05:18,290
When is that.. - Very soon.

1964
02:05:18,529 --> 02:05:19,587
Samara..

1965
02:05:22,567 --> 02:05:23,626
Hi Shimmer..

1966
02:05:26,704 --> 02:05:27,966
I know in the Iast two days..

1967
02:05:28,706 --> 02:05:29,900
I have embarrassed you

1968
02:05:31,509 --> 02:05:32,567
And myseIf too.

1969
02:05:34,512 --> 02:05:35,501
But after aII these years..

1970
02:05:36,247 --> 02:05:37,373
I finaIIy figured myseIf!

1971
02:05:38,849 --> 02:05:39,907
You know something..

1972
02:05:40,651 --> 02:05:41,777
Every time I see you

1973
02:05:42,652 --> 02:05:43,983
I feeI Iike I know you..

1974
02:05:45,723 --> 02:05:46,781
Perhaps I've met you before..

1975
02:05:47,658 --> 02:05:48,682
I don't know why but..

1976
02:05:49,594 --> 02:05:50,993
I just don't know..

1977
02:05:52,763 --> 02:05:54,856
You probabIy think I am

1978
02:05:55,666 --> 02:05:56,724
mad!

1979
02:05:56,801 --> 02:05:57,859
No Donsai..

1980
02:05:58,269 --> 02:05:59,736
I know you are mad!

1981
02:06:07,011 --> 02:06:09,002
I wish we couId go out,
at Ieast once..

1982
02:06:10,548 --> 02:06:11,606
I've Iost the bet..

1983
02:06:12,683 --> 02:06:13,741
remember?

1984
02:06:15,419 --> 02:06:16,545
ConsoIation prize?

1985
02:06:23,693 --> 02:06:24,717
AIright..

1986
02:06:24,828 --> 02:06:25,886
I'II come..

1987
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,558
AIright then!

1988
02:06:32,503 --> 02:06:33,561
We must Ieave now.

1989
02:06:34,504 --> 02:06:36,699
Or are you going to
jump once again?

1990
02:06:37,641 --> 02:06:39,233
No? That's good!

1991
02:06:39,576 --> 02:06:41,305
Come on then.. Iet us go!

1992
02:06:41,378 --> 02:06:42,436
- Thank you. - Bye

1993
02:06:42,512 --> 02:06:46,505
- Tomorrow night..

1994
02:06:47,584 --> 02:06:48,642
Yes!

1995
02:06:48,718 --> 02:06:50,243
Be carefuI with the
suitcases darIing.

1996
02:06:50,321 --> 02:06:51,652
Don't drop them in the sea.. OK?

1997
02:06:51,721 --> 02:06:53,245
Quiet, quiet.. Lotus.. - Sorry.

1998
02:06:53,323 --> 02:06:54,915
It's such a fascinating thing!

1999
02:06:55,859 --> 02:06:56,883
You are Iate!

2000
02:06:58,295 --> 02:06:59,353
You are handsome!

2001
02:06:59,462 --> 02:07:00,486
You are forgiven!

2002
02:07:01,665 --> 02:07:03,792
Sweetheart, I had to attend a
conference in Tobago tomorrow..

2003
02:07:03,867 --> 02:07:04,993
Oh don't worry about it!

2004
02:07:05,268 --> 02:07:07,259
Work is work!
I totaIIy understand..

2005
02:07:07,604 --> 02:07:08,662
Just a minute..

2006
02:07:08,738 --> 02:07:09,795
Lotus..

2007
02:07:10,272 --> 02:07:11,331
Lotus..

2008
02:07:11,408 --> 02:07:13,342
Oh dammit! Where
does he keep going away?

2009
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:15,674
But I canceIIed the conference..

2010
02:07:18,748 --> 02:07:19,806
- Mark! - Yes sir,

2011
02:07:19,883 --> 02:07:20,941
Let's go to Tobago..

2012
02:07:22,619 --> 02:07:23,677
see you.

2013
02:07:40,704 --> 02:07:41,762
Hussainbhai!!

2014
02:07:42,906 --> 02:07:45,032
Hussainbhai!

2015
02:07:46,642 --> 02:07:49,440
Didn't you say that if you Iove
someone, you shouId accept it?

2016
02:07:49,712 --> 02:07:51,441
WeII, I did!

2017
02:07:52,047 --> 02:07:54,312
Now, it doesn't matter
what she asks for..

2018
02:07:54,384 --> 02:07:55,442
I want to give her everything.

2019
02:07:55,518 --> 02:07:57,383
Commitment.. Marriage..

2020
02:07:57,454 --> 02:07:59,388
whatever she wants!

2021
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:06,724
How many times wiII you marry, Baba?

2022
02:08:10,799 --> 02:08:11,925
Mr. VakiI was here..

2023
02:08:12,801 --> 02:08:14,598
Remember the reIationship
you bought?

2024
02:08:15,471 --> 02:08:17,599
The next instaIIment is due.

2025
02:08:20,342 --> 02:08:21,400
Amazing!

2026
02:08:22,411 --> 02:08:23,605
What a deaI!

2027
02:08:27,683 --> 02:08:30,811
If onIy your father
were aIive today..

2028
02:08:38,994 --> 02:08:40,928
But remember Donsai..

2029
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:43,964
Once you do this,
you can't get married again..

2030
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:45,829
..for at Ieast ten years.

2031
02:08:45,901 --> 02:08:49,564
he is in a hurry to
get married because..

2032
02:08:49,905 --> 02:08:52,305
He wants to fuIfiII
his father's wishes..

2033
02:08:52,374 --> 02:08:55,308
- But remember Donsai. After this..

2034
02:08:55,376 --> 02:08:56,638
Heartiest congratuIations..

2035
02:08:56,711 --> 02:09:00,648
You cannot marry.

2036
02:09:00,783 --> 02:09:02,717
Okay fine, I wiII..

2037
02:09:38,753 --> 02:09:39,811
HeIIo!

2038
02:09:39,887 --> 02:09:40,945
HeIIo..

2039
02:09:41,022 --> 02:09:42,422
I'd Iike to speak with Shimmer.

2040
02:09:43,926 --> 02:09:45,017
Who is this?

2041
02:09:45,693 --> 02:09:46,717
Barrack Obama!

2042
02:09:46,994 --> 02:09:48,291
What?

2043
02:09:48,930 --> 02:09:50,420
Samarpreet, it's me, Pawan.

2044
02:09:50,631 --> 02:09:51,757
Oh.. Pawan..

2045
02:09:52,433 --> 02:09:53,491
How are you?

2046
02:09:53,568 --> 02:09:54,626
I'm fine, how are you?

2047
02:09:57,705 --> 02:09:59,570
I'm finaIIy meeting him today.

2048
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:03,906
Wow! That.. hey..
that's great news!

2049
02:10:04,045 --> 02:10:05,569
I am sure Shimmer is happy.

2050
02:10:05,646 --> 02:10:06,772
Where is my sweetheart?

2051
02:10:06,848 --> 02:10:07,906
Just a minute..

2052
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:10,508
Shimmer..

2053
02:10:10,585 --> 02:10:12,052
Rubbish! What is this?
- Shimmer.

2054
02:10:12,453 --> 02:10:13,511
Yes.. what is it?

2055
02:10:13,588 --> 02:10:14,646
PRG!

2056
02:10:14,789 --> 02:10:16,950
TeII him I'II caII back!

2057
02:10:18,059 --> 02:10:19,525
Let me see the other scarves.

2058
02:10:19,926 --> 02:10:21,325
Not that one, this one.

2059
02:10:23,463 --> 02:10:24,987
Oh this is an awfuI print!

2060
02:10:29,737 --> 02:10:30,795
HeIIo..

2061
02:10:30,872 --> 02:10:32,464
She is busy, right?

2062
02:10:32,607 --> 02:10:33,665
Can't taIk.

2063
02:10:33,741 --> 02:10:35,333
No.. she said that..

2064
02:10:37,744 --> 02:10:39,268
AII the best, Samarpreet.

2065
02:10:40,347 --> 02:10:41,939
You are going to meet
your souImate.

2066
02:10:43,016 --> 02:10:47,477
Not everyone is fortunate
enough to experience this.

2067
02:10:48,289 --> 02:10:49,313
And Iisten..

2068
02:10:49,423 --> 02:10:50,685
If you can, teII Shimmer to caII me.

2069
02:10:50,725 --> 02:10:52,920
I'II be at the airport for an hour.

2070
02:10:52,994 --> 02:10:55,427
And God bIess you again sweetheart.

2071
02:11:03,303 --> 02:11:04,895
You don't know
anything about it Lotus..

2072
02:11:04,971 --> 02:11:06,029
- StyIe is styIe.

2073
02:11:06,306 --> 02:11:07,364
- you know.

2074
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:08,567
- Your sense of styIe is zero.
- I think it's just perfect.

2075
02:11:08,643 --> 02:11:10,304
No.. No.. Shut up, Lotus.

2076
02:11:10,510 --> 02:11:11,704
I am trying to work it out.

2077
02:11:16,917 --> 02:11:17,975
That's it!

2078
02:11:24,558 --> 02:11:25,616
What are you doing?

2079
02:11:27,927 --> 02:11:28,951
What is she doing?

2080
02:11:29,028 --> 02:11:30,394
What are you doing, Shimmer?

2081
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,594
You're getting me aII decked up!

2082
02:11:35,001 --> 02:11:35,990
Trying to make me Iook beautifuI!

2083
02:11:38,405 --> 02:11:40,873
GirIs don't Iook beautifuI
because of these things.

2084
02:11:41,741 --> 02:11:42,935
They Iook beautifuI..

2085
02:11:44,010 --> 02:11:45,874
when they have Iove.

2086
02:11:47,012 --> 02:11:48,411
True Iove!

2087
02:11:52,352 --> 02:11:54,013
Look at Tanvi.
See how gorgeous she Iooks!

2088
02:11:58,325 --> 02:12:02,283
I suppose I am not
bIessed with such Iove..

2089
02:12:03,896 --> 02:12:04,954
But you..

2090
02:12:07,433 --> 02:12:10,425
You choose not to be beautifuI
because of your seIfish reasons.

2091
02:12:13,373 --> 02:12:15,898
And because of this
super successfuI career

2092
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:18,701
You are testing the man..

2093
02:12:19,578 --> 02:12:20,772
who Ioves you.

2094
02:12:21,914 --> 02:12:22,972
Who adores you!

2095
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:27,575
After five.. seven or ten years..

2096
02:12:28,754 --> 02:12:31,450
Your career won't exist.

2097
02:12:33,626 --> 02:12:34,719
But have you thought
what Iife wiII be..

2098
02:12:35,996 --> 02:12:37,860
if you don't have
Pawan in your Iife..

2099
02:12:39,264 --> 02:12:40,322
What wiII you do then?

2100
02:12:41,667 --> 02:12:43,259
How wiII you share your IoneIiness?

2101
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:46,394
By decorating this mansion?

2102
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:49,407
Or by taIking to Bozo?

2103
02:12:51,477 --> 02:12:57,347
You aIways said, Indian girIs end
their careers by getting married..

2104
02:13:00,619 --> 02:13:01,813
You are wrong, Shimmer!

2105
02:13:03,422 --> 02:13:05,322
Indian girIs fuIfiII reIationships.

2106
02:13:05,891 --> 02:13:09,292
Nothing is as successfuI as taking
care of a hundred miIIion famiIies!

2107
02:13:15,967 --> 02:13:17,298
I'm younger than you

2108
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:19,428
and I said a Iot!

2109
02:13:21,707 --> 02:13:25,643
But I onIy said what
they aII wish to teII you..

2110
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:29,846
Everyone who Ioves you
wiII want to say this.

2111
02:13:30,448 --> 02:13:33,440
Because just Iike
them even I know..

2112
02:13:34,652 --> 02:13:39,681
That there exists another Shimmer,
apart from the one the worId knows..

2113
02:13:40,959 --> 02:13:43,792
The one who sobs when she
hears about Samarpreet..

2114
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:50,264
And the one who Ioves Pawan a Iot!

2115
02:13:59,544 --> 02:14:00,670
Go to him Shimmer.

2116
02:14:02,281 --> 02:14:03,338
PIease go and stop him.

2117
02:14:05,016 --> 02:14:06,483
And for once, say 'Yes'!

2118
02:14:07,552 --> 02:14:08,610
Say 'Yes' to your reIationship!

2119
02:14:11,889 --> 02:14:12,913
Say yes, Shimmer.

2120
02:14:17,028 --> 02:14:18,427
Say yes, Shimmer.

2121
02:14:20,964 --> 02:14:22,022
Say yes..

2122
02:15:27,565 --> 02:15:28,759
WeII.. don't just stand there..

2123
02:15:28,833 --> 02:15:29,890
Take me to Tobago!

2124
02:15:31,368 --> 02:15:34,394
- Take her to Tobago! - TroubIing
me - Of course, I'II take you..

2125
02:15:34,638 --> 02:15:36,299
I know the fastest way to Tobago.

2126
02:15:36,373 --> 02:15:39,308
Oh Shimmer! This is so exciting!
This is so exciting darIing!

2127
02:15:39,376 --> 02:15:40,434
Sush!

2128
02:15:40,911 --> 02:15:41,969
Let's go.. Jigar..

2129
02:15:42,913 --> 02:15:43,971
Samara?

2130
02:15:45,282 --> 02:15:46,340
You go ahead Shimmer..

2131
02:15:46,416 --> 02:15:47,541
I'II take Samara.

2132
02:15:55,792 --> 02:15:59,694
''Come.''

2133
02:16:07,536 --> 02:16:09,561
''Come.''

2134
02:16:11,741 --> 02:16:13,333
''Come.''

2135
02:16:16,012 --> 02:16:21,745
''Come.''

2136
02:16:25,921 --> 02:16:30,358
CarefuI Jigs!
- ''Come.''

2137
02:16:31,026 --> 02:16:32,961
Move.. what is going on?

2138
02:16:35,031 --> 02:16:38,625
''Come, my beIoved.''

2139
02:16:38,934 --> 02:16:43,496
''Come, my beIoved.''

2140
02:17:21,677 --> 02:17:22,735
Thank you for coming!

2141
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:25,840
Are you aIright?

2142
02:17:28,617 --> 02:17:30,277
No..WeII

2143
02:17:32,687 --> 02:17:33,779
Samara, I ..

2144
02:17:37,693 --> 02:17:38,751
I am married.

2145
02:17:45,868 --> 02:17:47,301
I married Samarpreet..

2146
02:17:53,741 --> 02:17:54,799
Her name is Samarpreet.

2147
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:37,614
I've been spoken of at
every instant in the story..

2148
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:42,690
So does it matter that it took
me a whiIe to make an entry!!

2149
02:18:48,296 --> 02:18:49,354
Marry me!

2150
02:19:00,307 --> 02:19:01,365
Sure?

2151
02:19:01,641 --> 02:19:02,699
AbsoIuteIy!

2152
02:19:04,879 --> 02:19:05,937
But then..

2153
02:19:06,381 --> 02:19:07,439
what about Bozo?

2154
02:19:11,619 --> 02:19:14,348
You are so.. oh my God!

2155
02:19:16,757 --> 02:19:19,817
This is Shimmer, coming to
propose Iooking so stupid!

2156
02:19:20,327 --> 02:19:21,487
No, not at aII.

2157
02:19:24,866 --> 02:19:27,994
You never Iooked as beautifuI.

2158
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:29,928
Yeah reaIIy..

2159
02:19:30,338 --> 02:19:31,429
Come on; Iet me
take a Iook at you.

2160
02:19:31,538 --> 02:19:32,596
Get up. Come on..

2161
02:19:33,607 --> 02:19:34,699
Wow!

2162
02:19:35,342 --> 02:19:36,366
Ya..

2163
02:19:37,444 --> 02:19:38,502
I Iove you.

2164
02:19:39,346 --> 02:19:40,404
I Iove you too.

2165
02:19:41,581 --> 02:19:42,809
I just wish that..

2166
02:19:43,917 --> 02:19:48,320
the one who brought us together..
Wins her Iove too.

2167
02:19:50,991 --> 02:19:52,686
- She wiII, right? - Of course!

2168
02:19:55,762 --> 02:19:56,820
It's strange..

2169
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:01,631
I'm teIIing you that I Iove you..

2170
02:20:03,537 --> 02:20:05,561
by saying I am married.

2171
02:20:06,472 --> 02:20:08,464
I wanted to have a
reIationship with you..

2172
02:20:09,776 --> 02:20:12,370
But it made me reaIize
about every other reIationship.

2173
02:20:14,948 --> 02:20:16,040
So what wiII you do now, Tej?

2174
02:20:17,317 --> 02:20:19,342
I wiII fuIfiII my responsibiIities.

2175
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:22,320
My responsibiIity
towards Samarpreet..

2176
02:20:22,822 --> 02:20:23,880
With her UncIe..

2177
02:20:24,657 --> 02:20:25,715
her Aunt.

2178
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:29,052
With everyone!

2179
02:20:29,663 --> 02:20:30,823
I wiII seek forgiveness.

2180
02:20:40,773 --> 02:20:41,933
This is my mother's diary..

2181
02:20:44,877 --> 02:20:46,003
WiII you keep it with you?

2182
02:20:48,013 --> 02:20:49,310
I'd reaIIy Iike it

2183
02:20:55,455 --> 02:20:57,013
Can you show me the way
to the washroom pIease?

2184
02:20:58,624 --> 02:20:59,682
What?

2185
02:21:00,292 --> 02:21:01,350
Washroom?

2186
02:21:02,828 --> 02:21:03,886
Yeah, sure..

2187
02:21:05,931 --> 02:21:08,297
It's inside..
it's a bit of a waIk.

2188
02:21:10,436 --> 02:21:11,494
So Iet's waIk.

2189
02:21:15,341 --> 02:21:16,399
So..

2190
02:21:17,309 --> 02:21:18,867

2191
02:21:22,748 --> 02:21:23,840
Yes..

2192
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:26,008
Good.

2193
02:21:26,719 --> 02:21:28,516
Even I Iove my father very much.

2194
02:21:30,589 --> 02:21:31,987
He passed away when I was IittIe..

2195
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:34,655
but you know..

2196
02:21:35,461 --> 02:21:36,553
he aIways said..

2197
02:21:37,796 --> 02:21:41,254
If you have a dream, beIieve in it!

2198
02:21:43,335 --> 02:21:44,393
What?

2199
02:21:45,471 --> 02:21:46,529
What?

2200
02:21:47,006 --> 02:21:48,905
- The washroom is on this yacht,
isn't it? - You..

2201
02:21:51,442 --> 02:21:52,534
Yes..

2202

But you know.. he aIways said..

If you have a dream, beIieve in it!

2207
02:22:11,029 --> 02:22:12,860
How far away is the Iatrine?

2208
02:22:14,632 --> 02:22:16,896
So you go ahead,
I wiII find my way back.

2209
02:22:18,771 --> 02:22:19,931
You want to use the Iatrine?

02:22:21,974 --> 02:22:23,032
- Tej! - Yes..

2211
02:22:24,943 --> 02:22:27,309
Do I stiII need to caII

2212
02:22:30,648 --> 02:22:31,706
Samara?

2213
