1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,125


3
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,000
I am suspicious whether
he has an affair with Kavitha

4
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:31,417
Don't have any doubt.

5
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,333
He roams around with Kavitha.

6
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,292
How can you bring home a girl
who is more beautiful than you?

7
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:43,083
Men get tempted easily.

8
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,125
Why don't you understand this?

9
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,875
You brought her for your company.
He accompanied her in ***

10
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:49,292
Cry nicely.

11
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,042
What is the use of crying now?

12
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:52,625
Don't cry.

13
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,667
I will cry as well, it seems.

14
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:54,958
Wipe your tears

15
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't cry

16
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,208
If my daughter pavalakodi
has come means it vil be a problem

17
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,833
I will think of you or
my daughter future?

18
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,042
(Tamil tv serial)
After a break.

19
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,958
I didn't inform him that
I bought this vehicle.

20
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,500
I should somehow tell him today.

21
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:33,458
What is this?

22
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,583
Look at this.

23
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:51,875
New model vehicle.

24
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,250
Isn't it good?

25
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,417
It's an limited edition

26
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,333
We have to order before even

27
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,000
We have to ask were she bouht the vechile?

28
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,542
hmm sure

29
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,875
Excuse me. May I know in
which showroom did you get this vehicle?

30
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,667
I foresaw this last week.

31
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,542
Didn't this happen now?

32
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,333
This is inappropriate.

33
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,333
I said don't cry

34
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,250
What shall i do now?

35
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:18,750
Dad!

36
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,667
I don't know what to do now.

37
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:21,833
Dad!

38
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,500
I don't know
what to do now.

39
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,792
I couldn't switch it off.

40
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,000
My dear boy!

41
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,083
Dad...How long should I call you?

42
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,583
Dad was here all this while.

43
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,000
I was wiping the television.

44
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,417
I went in just now, heard the
sound of TVS and returned.

45
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:32,833
You!

46
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,417
You were wiping TV?

47
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,042
Yes.

48
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,750
You go inside.

49
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,417
Why suddenly she became silent
and not talking anything.

50
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,708
You are always watching serials.

51
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,750
Go and prepare dosa soon.

52
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:44,625
I wanted to raise
my daughter like a man.

53
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
She changed me as a woman.

54
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,167
Marriage season started
for my daughter.

55
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:54,542
Astrologer wanted me to come to him
this month after visiting our family deity.

56
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,750
How do I tell this to my daughter?

57
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,542
How am I going to take her to the temple?

58
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,333
She is aging.

59
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:01,833
Dad,

60
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,292
you are aging.

61
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,958
You should get married soon.

62
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,292
She is voicing my thoughts.

63
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,917
You are matching horoscopes!

64
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,958
Why don't you speak up?

65
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,958
You are alone.

66
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,292
If you get married, both of
you can watch serials together.

67
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,792
Is she trying to make me speak?

68
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,208
I guess, no!

69
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,958
What if I get one of
my friends marry you?

70
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,333
I will not suffer step motherly treatment and
she will be an acquaintance to you.

71
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,750
Beautiful friends of you...!

72
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,875
Praba or Rohini...?

73
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,625
She has put words into my mouth.

74
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:39,958
She thrown it

75
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,292
How can i go like this?

76
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,458
She has defamed me
early in the morning.

77
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,375
Don't know what is in her mind.

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,042
Muruga!

79
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:57,542
You can't even sit or stand at your will.
How dare you name Praba or Rohini,

80
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:58,542
Did you notice?

81
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:01,125
Dad is becoming insane at this age.

82
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,792
Let's do something.

83
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,625
We shall visit our family deity

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,667
and pray that I should be alright.

85
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,333
You want me to take to the temple,
somehow...isn't it?

86
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,875
Is that a place?

87
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,583
We should walk 5 kms after
getting off a bus!

88
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,042
I won't come

89
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:13,250
Go...

90
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,833
Boy! You shouldn't say so.

91
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,333
Aren't we walking 14 kilometres around
Thiruvannamalai

92
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,167
This is our family deity. We must walk
the stretch to reach that temple.

93
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,542
I already told you I won't come.
Why are you torturing me?

94
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:22,542
Won't you listen to what I...

95
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:24,375
Don't shout.

96
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,417
What did the doctor say?

97
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,333
Eat this!

98
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:31,958
Ok. I will walk for you.

99
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,125
Success!

100
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,167
Why should you walk?

101
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,458
Let's go by our car.

102
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,833
Did you see my sister's call taxis?

103
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:44,958
Ok.

104
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,792
Go to your work.

105
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:46,792
Welcome dear.

106
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,750
Brother, you are looking too skinny.

107
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,125
Pavazhakodi..

108
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,625
Aren't you cooking for my brother?

109
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,000
Do I look skinny?

110
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,000
I am as heavy as a pillar.

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,250
Will you stop us at the door
and talk?

112
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,792
Come in. Come in brother!

113
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,208
See...She went in as soon as I told.

114
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,750
My sister listens to whatever I say.

115
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,083
Get lost.

116
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,750
Brother, what is the
purpose of your visit?

117
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,458
Nothing dear!

118
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,625
I am planning to visit our
family deity for prayers.

119
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,833
To our family deity, brother!

120
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,375
Yes sister!

121
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,208
I visited when we started
our call taxi business.

122
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,500
I am eager too.

123
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,292
When are you going?

124
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,000
Now!

125
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,375
That's why we are here.

126
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,958
Provide us with 15 cars.

127
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,625
Let's take our neighbours too

128
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,792
and visit in group.

129
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:22,458
Let people watch VK family tour.

130
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,792
You daughter in law will be elated.

131
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,583
How can you suddenly
ask for vehicles?

132
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,042
Our cars are too busy.

133
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,292
You know our company number.

134
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,583
Book cars quoting that
you are my relative.

135
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,917
I will ask them to
give you a discount.

136
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:34,917
Dad...

137
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:35,833
Come on. Let's leave.

138
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,625
Don't be in a hurry, boy!

139
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,375
Shall we leave?

140
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:40,583
What is going on?

141
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,792
They are going to visit our family deity,
it seems and wants car.

142
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:44,750
They have come to get the
vehicle free of cost.

143
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,333
They want car to visit temple today.

144
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,583
Do they know how to sit in a car?

145
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,375
Do they deserve a car?

146
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,417
Brother-in-law,

147
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,583
mind your words!

148
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,875
What do you mean?

149
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,042
How dare you say we have
come to take car free of cost?

150
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,417
After your parents' demise of cholera,

151
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:05,167
It was he who raised you like
parents and educated you,

152
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,417
A for Apple

153
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,375
and B for Ball

154
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,375
U have to study

155
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,542
He admitted you in
english medium school

156
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:14,083
He cycled you
13 kilometres to school daily!

157
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,667
When the girls of
your age were cooking,

158
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,250
He sent you to college.

159
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,458
What you have to do?

160
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,917
You should have learnt there.

161
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,292
Instead, what did you do?

162
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:22,792
Brother

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,458
You told your brother that
you are in love with a landlord

164
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:28,500
When he went to inquire,
it is found that he is not a landlord

165
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,750
but a shepherd in his home.

166
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,458
My daughter's flow is interrupted.

167
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,208
Dad...

168
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:35,958
Where did I stop?

169
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,958
On his face!

170
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,708
He mortgaged his home for your marriage

171
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,083
And gave you 50 sovereigns of gold,

172
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,625
He did a marriage for you.

173
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:48,042
And an ambassador car to
your husband who has no other means!

174
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,833
Your husband doesn't deserve
to ride even a bullock cart.

175
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,500
With that,

176
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,000
Keep multiplying things

177
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,708
he started this call taxi company
using all evil deeds.

178
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:01,042
Named your company as VK using
my dad's name Vairakannu...

179
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:06,167
The capital for our growth is my dad's
ambassador car,

180
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,250
his name and his fortune.

181
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:14,250
How dare you say he is
asking for a free ride?

182
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,292
Who are you to give me a discount?

183
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,375
Thangamani,

184
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,458
note this down!

185
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,708
She can't write.

186
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,083
Say louder. Dad will write.

187
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,583
We will buy a car,

188
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,000
start a call taxi company

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,917
and make it bigger...

190
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,750
If we don't ruin your empire,

191
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,333
my name is not Pavazhakodi.

192
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:33,333
Dad

193
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,458
My name is not Vairakannu!

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,667
Dad...

195
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:37,083
Come, let's go!

196
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:37,708
I am coming

197
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,917
Belly guy.

198
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,375
Are you my mother's child?

199
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,042
Monkey!

200
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,167
Crooked faced woman!

201
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,583
Bye...

202
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,792
Who are you?

203
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,542
How can u pay the money?

204
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,417
EMI or CASH?

205
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,292
We can apply a loan ?

206
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,708
What are we going to do with
100 sovereigns of gold at home!

207
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,958
We shall pay cash and buy!

208
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,292
No need of EMI!

209
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,750
Bed sheets are of low cost.
Please buy, madam

210
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,083
Who are you all?

211
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:29,875
What do you want?

212
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:31,625
Watchman!

213
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,083
NO. Don't do anything...

214
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,500
Please leave me.

215
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,292
Please leave me.

216
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,708
Please leave me.

217
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,333
There are newly married,

218
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,625
Look under the bed!

219
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,833
Only two chains are found!

220
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,042
Not all the jewellery?

221
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,125
Where are the 100 sovereigns

222
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,167
Where?

223
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,625
Her husband will come now!

224
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,583
He won't come now!

225
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,417
Time is already 10.

226
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:23,417
I thought she will get up at 5 to
wake me to implement the challenge made.

227
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,042
Are you sleeping till 10?

228
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,417
I shouldn't allow this.

229
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,292
Boy Pavazha!

230
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,125
Boy Pavazha!

231
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,833
Boy Pavazha!

232
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,625
Boy Pavazha!

233
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:49,792
Dad likes his sister Thangamani
more than you!

234
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,250
Dad...you are into spiritual mood
in the morning?

235
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,042
It's my prayer!

236
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,458
What is your prayer?

237
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,708
To get a kick from you!

238
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,750
Are you kidding?

239
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,250
Did I kick you?

240
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,333
Is this the time to play?

241
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,458
Boy Pavazha!

242
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,792
Did you forget
what happened yesterday?

243
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,333
What happened?

244
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,667
Do you ask me what happened?

245
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,417
Your aunt humiliated you.

246
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,208
Shouldn't you be angry?

247
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,375
Shouldn't we be angry?

248
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,333
You should have woke me
up early in the morning,

249
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,250
To buy a car for starting
a call taxi company...!

250
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,625
I just said that in a flow yesterday.

251
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,125
Should we start for sure?

252
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,458
Did you say that in a flow?

253
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,000
I was afraid that you were serious.

254
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:42,500
Leave it.

255
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,083
I am getting monthly pension.

256
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:44,667
Let's continue eating

257
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:45,375
and sleeping.

258
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,917
Let's continue sleep

259
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:46,250
and eating

260
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,042
ok?

261
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,167
was serious!

262
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,167
10, 20, 30, 40...

263
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,542
What are you doing?

264
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:55,875
Money to buy car...!

265
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,875
To buy a car!

266
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,375
A Toy car!

267
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,042
I will get you 2 or 3 toy cars
with this money for you to play.

268
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,667
Get all your savings!

269
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,375
I don't have any savings!

270
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:09,792
Shall I get it?

271
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,625
Why have you kept it in soil?

272
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:14,708
Soil!

273
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,000
That is mustard!

274
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,375
Is this mustard?

275
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,292
Where are you going?

276
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,667
How did you find
this out so easily?

277
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,000
I drank it for sorrow.
She might have had it to sleep,

278
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:32,625
i suppose!

279
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,625
Only we both live here.

280
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,042
Then, why did you
hide this in suspicion?

281
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,458
No suspicion!

282
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,375
I have hidden this for
safety from thieves.

283
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,750
You have taken all of
your father's wealth.

284
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:55,875
There is something else too.

285
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,875
What else is left?

286
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,833
This is a silver rope.

287
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,958
Pavazhakodi,

288
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,917
you have taken the
silver rope as well!

289
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,708
Bring that too!

290
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:07,917
Not that one!

291
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,292
Bring that I say!

292
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:10,667
Please!

293
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,542
Not that one!

294
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:12,417
Will you get it or not?

295
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:14,458
Ok. I will bring!

296
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,208
Without any kindness or compassion...

297
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,250
Try to touch your mother's
property after she is gone.

298
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:36,958
What?

299
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,250
Nothing!

300
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,333
while you were putting
me on the cradle...!

301
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:47,917
Why do you feel so much for a woman
who eloped with our neighbour

302
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:48,458
Give that!

303
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,458
She is your mother!

304
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,708
Get lost!

305
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,500
This is the newly
constructed apartment!

306
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,875
Only some are full.

307
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,958
They have done this
in their absence.

308
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,625
This is a brutal rape, murder

309
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,292
and theft!

310
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,417
At what time do you usually
return home after work?

311
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,417
I will go in the morning 8am
and return in the night 9pm.

312
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,500
Send the body
for post-mortem!

313
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,208
ok sir!

314
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,000
Kumar!

315
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,458
He is the landlord, sir!

316
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:57,958
Greetings sir!

317
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,875
You have constructed
such a huge apartment!

318
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,083
Can't you fix a
CCTV security system?

319
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,083
Only just a couple of days before,
they have marked for fixing CCTV cameras.

320
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,333
This happened before that!

321
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,792
Try to fix it as soon as possible.

322
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:08,458
Ok sir.

323
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,500
She is the maid
of that house.

324
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,167
At what time will you come
for work in the morning?

325
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:13,083
At 8 O' clock sir!

326
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,750
I will leave at 9 after finishing my work

327
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,333
and come back at 4 in the evening.

328
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,750
Did you see anybody
roaming around suspiciously?

329
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,208
No sir!

330
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,292
Who is their neighbour?

331
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,542
They are the neighbours.

332
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:21,875
Come here.

333
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,750
Did you hear any noise?

334
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:26,292
No sir!

335
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,167
What is your husband?

336
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,667
He is abroad!

337
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,417
Have you ever
spoke to that lady?

338
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,625
We don't talk to anybody.

339
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,042
We stay indoors.

340
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,375
Do not come out.

341
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,167
Because is good to
socialize with neighbours.

342
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,875
Did anybody heard noise

343
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:41,667
No sir,

344
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,958
or seen somebody
roaming here suspiciously?

345
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:43,583
No sir,

346
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,375
Aren't you going?

347
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,083
Sir.

348
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,125
Does Vegetable vendor,

349
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,750
Paper boy

350
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,167
or milk vendors

351
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,292
come inside?

352
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,667
Milk and paper boys
deliver in bulk and leave.

353
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,625
It is me who used to deliver
those to each apartment!

354
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,958
Where were you at
the time of murder?

355
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,958
I have gone to leave
the children at school!

356
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:16,750
Kumar!

357
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:16,958
Sir!

358
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,583
Inquire the neighbourhood

359
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,917
and come to the station with details
of people who are not in this apartment.

360
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:21,583
Ok sir!

361
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:23,708
Welcome sir!

362
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,250
A paunch belly!

363
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,125
He should be drinking
beer at nights,

364
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,000
I suppose.

365
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,208
Boy Pavala!

366
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:57,958
Why are you standing there?

367
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:58,875
What happened?

368
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,083
Nothing dad.

369
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:00,500
DonÃ­t know...

370
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,125
but I am anxious!

371
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,792
You lied and didnÃ­t eat
the breakfast I served.

372
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,792
Did you take the tablets?

373
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:06,583
Come on.
LetÃ­s go to the doctor!

374
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:07,292
No dad!

375
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:08,208
I am ok!

376
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:08,542
Come on.

377
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:09,042
Come on, I say!

378
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,167
No dad.

379
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,000
I am ok.

380
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,583
Come,

381
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:11,833
letÃ­s go!

382
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:15,792
What car shall we buy?

383
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,083
Come inside sir

384
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:16,458
Dad...

385
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,958
LetÃ­s buy trendy cars
like Innova, Swift or Indica!

386
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,792
Sir...This is ertiga car....

387
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,750
which is moving fast.

388
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,292
Moving fast!

389
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,583
2015 model!

390
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,792
It has good revalue, sir.

391
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,458
DonÃ­t tell about revalue
even before buying.

392
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,125
It has run just 10,000 kilometres.

393
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,250
This engine will give
you good mileage sir!

394
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:30,542
It should give good mileage!

395
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:31,208
It wonÃ­t cost you much!

396
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:31,958
Is it?

397
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,125
Why are you lying?

398
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,792
Will you tell these
many lies to sell a car?

399
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,542
Is this car ok, madam?

400
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,083
No. No this!

401
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,000
See this car, madam!

402
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:46,958
Full hi-tech model!

403
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,333
You will get this for
the rate you expect.

404
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:49,875
2013 model,

405
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:50,792
single owner!

406
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:51,917
It will give you good mileage!

407
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,375
This car looks good, dad!

408
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,875
It is good.

409
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,125
Enquire about its cost!

410
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,958
What is the bill amount?

411
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,042
Sir...I am looking
into the details of this!

412
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:01,958
I will tell you the
amount with tax!

413
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,500
I am waiting for you!

414
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:29,500
Dad!

415
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,042
Yes!

416
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,958
Shall we buy this car?

417
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:33,625
Which car?

418
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,625
This car!

419
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,500
Were is the strring?

420
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,208
ohh it's there...

421
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,375
This one!

422
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:39,042
Go da.

423
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:40,667
This must be placed in exhibitions!

424
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,042
This idiot has placed
it in the showroom!

425
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,542
Somebody should have exchanged
this eighty years ago!

426
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:45,583
DonÃ­t get fooled.

427
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,125
This is your dadÃ­s
hard earned money!

428
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:47,917
See dad!

429
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:48,750
What?

430
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,458
Dad!

431
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,083
Actually, generally,

432
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,000
All call taxi companies

433
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,208
will be owing normal cars
like swift, indica, innova...!

434
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:57,375
Yes. That is feasible.

435
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,667
But, what I am thinking
differently is,

436
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,208
What different...?

437
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,750
The car MGR used,

438
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,917
The car Shivaji used,

439
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,083
The car Kamarajar used...

440
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,125
PV ChinnapaÃ­s car,

441
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,750
Thiyagaraja BhagavatharÃ­s car,

442
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,708
AvvayarÃ­s car...!

443
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,833
Like that

444
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,667
Why donÃ­t we select antique cars

445
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,000
and start a call taxi company?

446
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What if we start?

447
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,833
If we do that

448
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:16,875
our customers will feel happy

449
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,375
The car Shivaji used,

450
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,708
The car MGR used,

451
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,333
that they rode in cars
used by celebrities!

452
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,292
Idea is different.

453
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,208
Tell me...is this different?

454
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,375
Think about my idea!

455
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,792
There will be no re sale
value for the old car.

456
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,417
No guarantee too!

457
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:32,583
You can get only dates in exchange!

458
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:35,500
Why do you want this, my boy?

459
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,708
This wonÃ­t work!

460
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,500
It will work!

461
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:39,958
I bought it!

462
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:40,667
Is it?

463
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:41,833
Do get tired of thinking all this!

464
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,167
I have got a superb punch
line for our call taxi.

465
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:43,833
What is that?

466
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:44,583
Listen!

467
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,250
We offer Juice for your thirst!

468
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,708
We donÃ­t compromise
in our quality!

469
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:48,792
Let me tell once.

470
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,000
We offer Juice for your thirst!

471
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,458
We donÃ­t compromise
in our quality!

472
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,417
IsnÃ­t it good?

473
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,667
Heard some noise!

474
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,625
Is that a cat?

475
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,625
The car key!
I have kept it here.

476
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:00,125
Tell me!

477
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:00,625
Please donÃ­t beat me!

478
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,292
Tell me!

479
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,417
Please donÃ­t beat me!

480
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:04,458
I will die if you continue to beat me!

481
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:05,833
Tell me!

482
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:06,875
Tell me!

483
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:07,417
Akilan!

484
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:08,625
Sir...

485
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,708
He keeps repeating
the same thing;

486
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,000
I have inquired thoroughly!

487
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,917
He has gone to leave children
at school on that time!

488
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,542
Do you want to inquire him?

489
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,000
Ask him to leave!

490
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:21,375
You can leave!

491
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,458
Thank yoy sir...

492
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:40,083
Somebody did this after keenly
observing the absence of watchman and husband...

493
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,000
Dad!

494
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:45,750
Come here.

495
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,583
Come here for a minute!

496
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:50,875
Did you notice!

497
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,542
I have pasted it
opposite their home!

498
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,125
Super dad!

499
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:53,917
Why are you shouting like this?

500
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:54,875
Look there!

501
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,375
This is not VK anymore.

502
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,792
PK! Pavalakodi Call Taxi!

503
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,667
Where is that bulky fellow?

504
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,000
If it is these many posters
in front of our home,

505
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,500
How much it would
be all over Tamilnadu?

506
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:14,125
Crooked face woman and bulky fellow
are finished from today!

507
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,458
I told you already,

508
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,375
if we have pasted 1000 posters
where people assemble,

509
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,958
We would have got many offers...!

510
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:44,792
What did you do?

511
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,667
You asked me to paste all posters
in front of your auntÃ­s home in anger.

512
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:51,708
What happened?

513
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:52,708
Did we get any call?

514
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:57,667
Is that a call?

515
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:58,083
Yes!

516
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,292
Let me attend the call!

517
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:00,292
Let me attend the call!

518
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,333
Let me attend the call!

519
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:01,958
Dad!

520
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,958
Welcome to Pavalakodi call taxi!

521
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,458
We offer Juice for your thirst!

522
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:10,875
We donÃ­t compromise in our quality!

523
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:12,625
Greetings!

524
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:13,250
Tell me!

525
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,167
There is a deadbody in Nesapakkam
to be carried to the Cemetery!

526
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:17,208
When can we expect the vehicle?

527
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,708
You expect the vehicle!

528
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:20,583
How dare...

529
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,375
You shouldnÃ­t scold the customer!

530
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,833
Customer!

531
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,958
Why this torture?

532
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:29,917
Dad!

533
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:30,208
Boy Pavala!

534
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,375
Dad is here!

535
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,625
Let it come in its pace.

536
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:33,667
DonÃ­t get emotional.

537
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,958
LetÃ­s entertain!

538
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:41,958
If we had wedge,

539
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,708
we would have got calls.

540
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,958
What?

541
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:49,167
I meant, the companies
flourish as they have wedge!

542
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:49,875
I donÃ­t get you!

543
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:50,625
Why donÃ­t you understand?

544
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,083
There are wedges
in the cell phone!

545
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,542
That is not wedge.

546
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,458
It is called app.

547
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,083
That is what I mean!

548
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,542
I shouldnÃ­t have educated you.

549
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,667
Treat your dad as a child.

550
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,208
No scolding.

551
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,583
Hello.

552
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,083
Welcome to Pavazhakodi call taxi!

553
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,250
We offer Juice for your thirst!

554
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,542
We donÃ­t compromise in our quality!

555
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,083
Tell me

556
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:17,625
Greetings madam!

557
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,958
I am calling from Tambaram!

558
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,250
We are planning to
visit Tirupathi Perumal!

559
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,083
Will you send your taxi?

560
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:25,917
Dad,

561
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,000
first trip is to Tirupathi!

562
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,167
Perumal has invited us.

563
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,125
Get ready soon!

564
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,625
Our car resembles a flight.

565
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,292
ThatÃ­s why dad is
wearing a pilotÃ­s costume!

566
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,083
Bye

567
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,250
Did you go to that apartment
last week to install CCTV camera?

568
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,000
Give me a pack of cigarettes!

569
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,583
Greetings sir!

570
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:26,958
Here it is!

571
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:29,917
ThatÃ­s ok sir!

572
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:30,292
Take it.

573
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,667
Do you know about a murder
that took place in the nearby apartment?

574
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,208
I heard about it sir!

575
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,667
Did you see anybody
roaming around suspiciously?

576
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:40,792
No sir!

577
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,083
How long are you running this shop?

578
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:42,917
For about three years!

579
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:45,167
Do you have a match box?

580
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,417
A lighter is there!

581
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,875
Take back your bed sheets!

582
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,167
ItÃ­s not even three days...

583
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,083
It is fading.

584
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,042
I will be dishonoured if I sell this!

585
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:57,708
Give my money back.

586
00:35:57,917 --> 00:35:58,583
No

587
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,417
Come later on!

588
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:00,000
No

589
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,417
Are you going to pay
my money now or not?

590
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:02,792
Why are you irritating me?

591
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,500
Wait.

592
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,667
Are you working in that apartment?

593
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:08,417
Yes sir!

594
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,208
Come here!

595
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Are you running a provision shop?

596
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,625
Or do you have
some other business?

597
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,167
No. I have a provision store!

598
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,458
Where do you get this bed sheet?

599
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,292
He wanted me to sell these
bed sheets for him.

600
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,333
It is fading within three days time.

601
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,083
ThatÃ­s why I have come to give it back
and get back my money!

602
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,667
There was a cycle here
with bed sheets on Friday!

603
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:35,917
I took 5 bed sheets from
that when no one was around!

604
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,667
I didnÃ­t do anything else sir!

605
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:38,750
I donÃ­t know anything sir!

606
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,083
How long was it here?

607
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,833
It was here from
9 OÃ­ clock in the morning.

608
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:44,542
Did you see the person?

609
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,583
I havenÃ­t seen him when he parked!

610
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,583
But I saw him when he left!

611
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:48,958
How does he look like?

612
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,083
He looked like a north Indian, sir!

613
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,833
Did you sell any bed sheet
in that apartment?

614
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:54,208
No sir!

615
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:55,125
Did you sell?

616
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:55,542
No!

617
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,667
The murder happened on Friday!

618
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,375
There was a cycle parked
here at around 9 in the morning!

619
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:02,167
He has taken it later.

620
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,000
There was an unused bed sheet at home!

621
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,333
The cycle was here with bed sheets!

622
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,542
But, they both havenÃ­t sold it!

623
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:09,125
Kumar!

624
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:10,083
Sir!

625
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:15,083
There was an unused bed sheet on a table
near the body in that apartment!

626
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:15,792
Bring that!

627
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:16,167
Yes sir,

628
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:25,583
Boy Pavala!

629
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:26,167
Dad...

630
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:27,625
Did you visit Tirupathi Perumal?

631
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,958
The customer who called
afternoon made me wait.

632
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,083
He has accepted to pay
the waiting charge.

633
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,458
The customer has come.

634
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:34,750
I will call you back,

635
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,250
Ok?

636
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,542
What?

637
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,000
Are you picking up
the customer just now?

638
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,917
I will call you back!

639
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:43,375
Sir...

640
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,417
Are you going to visit
Perumal at Tirupathi?

641
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,250
I donÃ­t go well with God!

642
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,250
Do you have any legal issue?

643
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,375
Why do you want to
go to Tirupathi Perumal?

644
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:09,208
Are you scared?

645
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,375
We are going on a long travel,

646
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,417
ThatÃ­s why I checked
whether you are brave or not!

647
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,625
You did that well.

648
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,042
You are very brave.

649
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:17,750
Go.

650
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,417
WHAT?

651
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,208
Your face already
looks masked.

652
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,292
Why do you use
a separate mask?

653
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:26,875
Sir..Shall I play music?

654
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,083
Shall I sing?

655
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,167
No sir!

656
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,333
Thank God. He unmasked
when the vehicle is at halt.

657
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,583
What would have
happened in motion?

658
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,208
People take the main road
to reach Tirupathi!

659
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,250
Not necessary.

660
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,375
I will take you in short cut.

661
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,167
Why do we use short cut
when there is a main road?

662
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:49,375
DonÃ­t talk louder. What if people
sleeping in the vehicle

663
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,667
wake up?

664
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,333
Sir...

665
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:57,250
Sir...

666
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,375
Hello

667
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,792
I am here, you blind!

668
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,375
He is churning me!

669
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,000
Why did you stop the
vehicle at the grave yard?

670
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,792
You want to meet
Tirupathi Perumal?

671
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:11,083
It is you who wanted to
meet Tirupathi Perumal!

672
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,417
Yes, I did.

673
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:13,708
So, letÃ­s meet!

674
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,667
He is Tirupathi!

675
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:22,417
Brother!

676
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,167
He is Perumal!

677
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,500
Why are you torturing me?

678
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,625
If a valuable customer calls you,

679
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,042
You can either accept

680
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,167
or decline,

681
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,167
Who is that girl,

682
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,667
who bombarded me that bad?

683
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,625
Come on.

684
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,708
Our next plan is to
visit Pazhani Murugan!

685
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,667
He will be the best man
who suits our plan.

686
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,708
Why doesnÃ­t it get started?

687
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:48,958
Something is standing
on the top?

688
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:55,417
Get away!

689
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:55,833
Leave me!

690
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,667
I am a poor thing!

691
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:07,208
Why do you look like
haunted by ghosts?

692
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:08,542
I am actually haunted!

693
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,083
Is he a man?

694
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:11,750
He took me to a grave yard!

695
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,458
Fox howls at the left side,

696
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,042
Dog barks at the right side

697
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,167
There is full of smoke in the front,

698
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,042
And there was a corpse that gets up
and sings while getting burned!

699
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:24,250
Take your shirt off

700
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:25,333
Why do you cry?

701
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,833
Why should have
started the car and left?

702
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:27,875
How do I start?

703
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,375
There is the key,
but it doesnÃ­t start!

704
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,417
The gear couldnÃ­t be operated!

705
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,625
I couldnÃ­t press
the accelerator too!

706
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,542
Window is
turning automatically

707
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,875
A ghost entered the car
and drove me here in reverse!

708
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,750
I was too terrified!

709
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,583
First trip itself was bad!

710
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,208
Shall we visit Bairava temple?

711
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:46,792
What?

712
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,875
Shall we visit Bairava temple?

713
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:49,583
This is good!

714
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:50,958
She herself initiates
going to the temple!

715
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,750
I should take her to the family deity

716
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,708
nd pray that her
marriage happens soon.

717
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:55,583
Dad...

718
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,542
Shall we go or not?

719
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,167
That old lady couldnÃ­t see properly
because of the light, it seems.

720
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,375
Switch it off for some time!

721
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Her ears too are not in
proper condition, it seems!

722
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,583
Where did you come?

723
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:34,625
Who accompanied you?

724
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,958
I have come with my daughter to
offer prayers for my family deity!

725
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:37,333
WhatÃ­s wrong?

726
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,208
This is not your place!

727
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,083
Go back!

728
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,333
What do you mean?

729
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:46,625
If you are thrashed by your
daughter-in-law at home,

730
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,417
Deal that at your home!

731
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:48,375
DonÃ­t counter argue!

732
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,083
Get lost!

733
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:51,500
Dad

734
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,333
She looks like a sage!

735
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,083
If she is wearing that costume,
will she become a sage?

736
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:59,500
Does a sage get boozed
and play around the forest temple?

737
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:00,542
This old woman is irritating!

738
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:01,167
If you keep standing,

739
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,542
I will run over the car on you!

740
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:03,208
Get lost!

741
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,792
Your wish wonÃ­t be fulfilled!

742
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:08,333
I have started a call taxi company
with my hard earned money.

743
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,333
How dare you say,
it wonÃ­t happen?

744
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,125
You witch, the time offered
to you is over. Get lost!

745
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:14,083
Your wish wonÃ­t be fulfilled!

746
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:17,875
Dad..

747
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:18,417
What is this?

748
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:19,000
Listen!

749
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,333
DonÃ­t get confused!

750
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,458
If she is into religious path,
she will speak soft!

751
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,875
This lady is cursing.

752
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:25,708
It wonÃ­t bother us!

753
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,333
Start the vehicle.

754
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,625
Dad...The car is not
moving at all!

755
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,667
This is a mud road.
It happens!

756
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:43,417
Come on. LetÃ­s walk!

757
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:10,708
It may rain, I suppose!

758
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,792
LetÃ­s offer our prayers and leave soon!

759
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,083
God Bairava!

760
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,000
My only daughter

761
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,417
should get married soon

762
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:22,000
and live happily.

763
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:22,750
Both of them

764
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,833
shouls live happily for many years.

765
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,708
God Bairava!

766
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:09,792
Brother!

767
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:10,208
Brother!

768
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:10,542
Brother!

769
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:14,417
Brother!

770
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:15,625
Brother!

771
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:25,500
Come on.

772
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:28,750
Come on.

773
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:22,417
Who is that?

774
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:26,042
Who is that?

775
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,292
Take the advance amount of 5 crores!

776
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,542
Please do the needful.

777
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:48,250
You knew about the money
and came here, right?

778
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:57,333
You were with me and betrayed me!

779
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,583
Leave me!

780
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,542
Take the money from the car
and leave the place

781
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:40,167
Is this your company bed sheet?

782
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,500
Yes sir!

783
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,875
I have come to interrogate in
connection with a murder case.

784
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,208
Your company bed sheet
is the only evidence.

785
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,667
Have you all plotted it together?

786
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:49,000
No sir!

787
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,208
We sell bed sheets on whole sale.

788
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:55,167
People take it for cheap price
and sell that as Rajasthan bed sheets.

789
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,292
Does north Indians buy
bed sheets regularly?

790
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,042

00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,083
4, 5 people come

792
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,208
Do you have that list?

00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:00,958

Hello.

This is the groom's father speaking!

799
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,250
We have started from home!

800
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,375
We will reach there in some time.

801
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:17,917
Who is that?

802
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:19,875
The groom's father!

803
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:22,042
Did you want me to
get ready for this?

804
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:24,875
Asked me wear sari early in the
morning for going to temple?

805
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:25,333
No.

806
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,500
I wanted to tell you yesterday.

807
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,542
Who asked you to arrange this?

808
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:28,958
Whose permission do I need for
arranging my daughter's marriage?

809
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,083
You should ask me!

810
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:30,667
Let them come.

811
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,667
I will humiliate them at the door
and send them back.

812
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:36,625
Don't just send them alone.

813
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,042
Send me too and stay here alone.

814
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,125
Your happiness alone is
important for you!

815
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:41,958
Hey!

816
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:43,875
You want me to get married.

817
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,000
Why didn't you get married
for the second time?

818
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:47,958
You thought she won't
take good care of me?

819
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:48,542
Boy Pavazha!

820
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:49,750
If you do something,
it is justified!

821
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,292
If I do the same thing,
is it selfishness?

822
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:51,833
No dear!

823
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:52,417
What no....?

824
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,292
Please try to understand!

825
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,625
A man can live alone in this world,

826
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,833
but not a girl!

827
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:58,833
Don't talk.
I may end up scolding you!

828
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,042
Scold your dad!

829
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:00,792
Look here.

830
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:05,292
Dad wants to see you get married
and live happily when I am alive.

831
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:08,125
Dad...

832
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:10,667
being with you is my happiness.

833
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,625
Boy Pavazha...

834
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:13,458
When Dad says something...

835
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,500
What is your problem now?

836
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,417
I want to get married,

837
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:17,958
isn't it?

838
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,667
Show somebody who is
ready to live in our house.

839
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,167
I will get married to him.

840
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:21,708
Is that ok?

841
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:23,917
Groom who stays with us?

842
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:25,583
Relieved

843
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:27,375
What?

844
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:30,042
How can your dad
cook for three people?

845
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,542
Dad can cook well!

846
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,542
You have agreed.

847
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:36,292
This is enough for me!

848
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,125
Good morning sir!

849
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,750
What Good morning?

850
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,750
Have you found out anything
regarding the apartment murder?

851
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,792
They have murdered in broad daylight!

852
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,250
No sir. I am inquiring.

853
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,333
Have you got any evidence?

854
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:51,875
No sir!

855
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:54,167
We are enquiring 8 people
at the station right now.

856
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,417
I am on the way to
the station now.

857
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:58,500
We should close that
case within this week.

858
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:01,875
The groom hasn't yet arrived.

859
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,958
He has gone outside.

860
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,833
He will reach now.

861
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:06,833

It was 8 people in the list.

867
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:14,458
Only 5 are here.

868
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:14,750
Where are the rest?

869
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,042
Two among the three
are out of station sir.

870
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:18,375
Another man's mobile
is not reachable.

871
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:19,333
Akilan,

00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,208

She will suit our son.

901
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:32,000
She is the right girl for our family.

902
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,625
Dad..

903
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:34,500

Send it soon.

914
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:56,833
Though we have 1000 vehicles,
there is shortage for services.

915
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,250
What did you ask?

916

928
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:23,792
Come on!

929
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:25,292
Who asked you to go there now?

930
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:25,750
Leave that place, now!

931
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,292
No!

932
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,708
Come and see the girl.

933
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:28,708
You will like her.

934
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:29,542
I am on duty now.

935
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:30,208
I cannot come.

936
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:30,792
Wait.

937
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:31,625
Talk to your dad!

938
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:33,500
What is this?

939
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,542
Don't humiliate us in
front of our relatives.

940
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,083
Come soon.

941
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,292
Only then we can leave this place.

942
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,542
Our son has come!

943
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:55,625
He is our boy!

944
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,125
See the girl!

945
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,417
I didn't like this girl!

946
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:03,625
Please leave now!

947
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,042
What...?

948
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:06,958
You didn't like her?

949
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:14,417
Have you ever seen a
more beautiful girl than me?

950
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,833
How dare you say,
you don't like me on my face!

951
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:18,208
Write it down!

952
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,083
I will take down.

953
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:21,750
1, 2, 3, 4...

954
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,958
There are many other
challenges too!

955
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,042
This is another one..

956
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:25,875
Let me write it in between.

957
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:26,917
How arrogant you are?

958
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:27,667
How arrogant you are?

959
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,167
Will you get married to
a more beautiful girl than me?

960
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,000
Will you?

961
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:30,292
Dad!

962
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:30,667
Dad!

963
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:31,375
What do you say?

964
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,083
Never!

965
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,167
Finish your challenge!

966
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,458
What if I do?

967
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,292
will stay a
virgin all my life!

968
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:36,958
I will!

969
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:38,083
This is a challenge!

970
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:38,583
Challenge!

971
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,125
She seems to be egoistic!

972
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,167
She seems to be egoistic!

973
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:42,250
She told this!

974
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:42,708
This won't be included in the challenge.

975
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:45,208
Leave. Fight won't follow immediately.

976
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:53,125
My daughter should
win this challenge.

977
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:53,583
Dad...

978
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:55,542
He said, he doesn't like me.

979
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:56,208
Leave him.

980
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,708
There are 40 people roaming
around the streets like him.

981
00:53:57,708 --> 00:54:00,333
You are only one in
the whole of south India!

982
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,333
Ok. You say something!

983
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,917
I am telling the truth.
You are just humble.

984
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:15,708
The phone is ringing.

985
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,917
Won't you attend?

986
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:18,125
Hello!

987
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,667
Welcome to Pavazhakodi call Taxi!

988
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:20,458
We have booked the taxi to Ooty!

989
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,417
Tell me, sir!

990
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:22,417
Will the car arrive?

991
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:23,458
It will come at 10pm.

992
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,208
What is the driver's number?

993
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,125
Driver's name is Anand!

994
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,375
He is contact you.

995
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:27,000
Ok sir.

996
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,958
Have a safe journey!

997
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:29,458
Dad...

998
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,708
I searched everywhere.

999
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:31,500
Did you see the key?

1000
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:32,250
No.

1001
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:36,583
Dad,

1002
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:37,833
did you misplace it somewhere?

1003
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,333
I don't know!

1004
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:45,208
Dad

1005
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,667
How come you are sitting
so irresponsibly?

1006
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:47,833
This is a 20 days tour.

1007
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,667
It's a huge order

1008
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,833
We can get 50,000 rupees.

1009
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:50,833
Won't you search?

1010
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,083
I won't.

1011
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:53,708
Dad...What happened to you?

1012
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,167
Greetings sir!

1013
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,083
I won't greet you.

1014
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:04,833
Who are you?

1015
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:05,333
Acting driver sir!

1016
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:06,792
Acting driver sir!

1017
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,125
Will you act like Arnold?

1018
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:11,042
You don't know English?

1019
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,083
Tell me madam!

1020
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,958
The car keys are missing.

1021
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:25,917
Can you start it with a spare key?

1022
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:27,125
Can you come please?

1023
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:28,542
There are a lot of vehicles in the shed.

1024
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:29,500
I am busy madam!

1025
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:31,125
Even if you are busy,

1026
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,708
Could you send
your assistant at least,

1027
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:33,042
please!

1028
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,042
Please!

1029
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:34,250
Ok. Ok.

1030
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,125
No need of an assistant,

1031
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:36,125
I will come now.

1032
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:36,750
Thank you!

1033
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:36,958
Thank you!

1034
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,167
Can you act like our own superstar?

1035
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:48,667
Sir!

1036
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,750
You are saying sir...sir
and giving a flat reaction!

1037
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,208
There is no other expression!

1038
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,500
And you claim
you are an acting driver!

1039
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,917
Does it look like ragging?

1040
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,375
Not looks like.

1041
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:01,792
I am ragging you.

1042
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:02,792
Greetings madam!

1043
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:04,250
What?

1044
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,292
Why do you say madam, all of a sudden?

1045
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:06,625
Why are you torturing him, dad?

1046
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:07,375
What do you want?

1047
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:08,792
Madam,

1048
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:10,833
please come and open the bonnet!

1049
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,208
I will start this car using my technique.

1050
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:20,833
Get a duplicate key on your way.

1051
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,750
How can he start the car without key?

1052
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,208
He is taking one rupee coin!

1053
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:32,917
He did some magic!

1054
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:37,833
I will leave, madam!

1055
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,875
Get a spare key and then start!

1056
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:40,250
Ok madam!

1057
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,083
Not necessary.

1058
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:42,833
I have the key with me!

1059
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:43,958
Dad!

1060
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,250
Why have you hidden the key?

1061
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,417
Aren't you responsible?

1062
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:47,833
You have snatched
the responsibility from me.

1063
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:51,292
I took you to Ooty, Kodaikanal
when you were young.

1064
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:52,875
Now you have grown up.

1065
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,417
Now you have grown up.

1066
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:55,875
Have you ever taken me out?

1067
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,333
You have appointed
an acting driver for this.

1068
00:56:57,708 --> 00:57:00,167
Are you planning to give
retirement to your active father?

1069
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,750
That's why I have
hidden the keys.

1070
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:03,333
Things are happening
beyond my capacity.

1071
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,792
I don't need the key.

1072
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:05,625
Get lost!

1073
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,542
Get lost boy Pavazha!

1074
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:10,250
Haven't you left yet?

1075
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,917
Gear is not working properly.

1076
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:11,625
It is struck.

1077
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:12,500
Start soon!

1078
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,542
Sir!

1079
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,208
Two among the three men left
to their place three months ago.

1080
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:40,792
The other one!

1081
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,208
Couldn't contact him sir!

1082
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,208
His number is not reachable.

1083
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,042
He has given a fake id.

1084
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,125
Was he buying bed sheets regularly?

1085
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:47,542
No sir.

1086
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:48,500
Not regular!

1087
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:49,833
He bought it only twice.

1088
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:50,958
Show his photo

1089
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:51,333
Sir.

1090
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:57,958
Fake id,

1091
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:01,875
didn't buy bed sheets regularly.

1092
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:06,625
We should nab him!

1093
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:06,958
Yes sir!

1094
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,292
Drive carefully.

1095
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,750
Drive carefully.

1096
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:01,125
The cyclist came on our way, sir!

1097
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:02,292
Drive safe.

1098
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,458
There are children around.

1099
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:04,458
Sorry madam!

1100
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,292
We believe in you and started our
10 days tour to Ooty and Kodaikanal.

1101
00:59:07,542 --> 00:59:08,083
If you drive like this here,

1102
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:09,458
How do you drive at the hills?

1103
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:10,375
Can't you tell him?

1104
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:11,417
Drive slowly!

1105
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:10,917
It is kodaikanal on left...
Ooty on the right.

1106
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,958
There is a bend in the middle.

1107
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:15,083
Put your seat belt.

1108
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,417
Otherwise, you will be gone.

1109
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,000
Who is vomiting inside the car?

1110
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:19,000
Dad...

1111
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:19,833
Dad...

1112
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:20,708
Dad...

1113
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:21,917
Go inside and sleep.

1114
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,125
It is not enough for me.

1115
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,542
Who is grabbing my bottle?

1116
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:32,875
Hello.

1117
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:33,792
Tell me Anand!

1118
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:35,167
Madam,

1119
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,167
something is in our car!

1120
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:37,292
There is trouble in this car!

1121
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,500
I got down from it.

1122
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:40,792
Hello. What happened?

1123
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:42,042
Is there any accident?

1124
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:43,542
Is anything wrong?

1125
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:44,167
What happened?

1126
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:44,833
We have escaped.

1127
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:45,708
All of us are safe.

1128
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,958
But this car has shown
us the fear of our lives.

1129
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,250
Something is in this car.

1130
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,625
We are afraid!

1131
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:52,667
Where is the car now?

1132
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:53,792
Where are you all?

1133
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:57,708
It is at the babul forest near
Madhurandhagam stone quarry!

1134
01:00:58,833 --> 01:00:59,208
Hello...

1135
01:00:59,458 --> 01:00:59,792
Hello..

1136
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:12,500
Dad...

1137
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,000
You swine!

1138
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:37,458
Who are you?

1139
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:38,083
Come here

1140
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:38,333
Bitch

1141
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,625
Banged on me!

1142
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:43,542
I won't spare you!

1143
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:45,000
Come here

1144
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:57,458
Dude

1145
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:18,417
Sir...He looks like the accused
we are searching for!

1146
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,625
He was run over by a car.

1147
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,583
But his body looks like it was acid attacked.

1148
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,375
But he was run over by a car, I believe.

1149
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,208
When did this happen?

1150
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:30,708
Just before 2, 3 hours!

1151
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:31,792
Did you find out his area?

1152
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:32,875
Not yet known sir!

1153
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,750
The provisional store near the apartment...

1154
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:36,125
Are you the one?

1155
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:36,375
Come on!

1156
01:10:36,917 --> 01:10:38,458
Is he the one who took
the cycle the other day?

1157
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:43,792
Yes sir.

1158
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:45,000
is that the guy?

1159
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:47,292
This is the one!

1160
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:48,500
Go!

1161
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:52,917
Does anybody of you know him?

1162
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,292
Does anybody of you know him?

1163
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:58,000
No sir! No sir!

1164
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:00,250
Why did you make people stand here?

1165
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,167
Ask them to leave!

1166
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:10,833
Inspector has reached the spot!

1167
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:23,083
Kumar!

1168
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:23,542
Sir!

1169
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,167
See...What is that?

1170
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:29,292
Sir...This looks like a radiator cap of a car.

1171
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,833
Leave. I asked you all to leave.

1172
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:43,125
Somebody followed us and killed Pawan!

1173
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,417
Police may track our number.

1174
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:49,375
Don't open your mouth if they ask something.

1175
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:51,750
Let us be silent and not operate for some time.

1176
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,958
I will contact you from any number.

1177
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,208
They have dashed him in a car

1178
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,375
They killed my friend

1179
01:12:05,667 --> 01:12:06,917
I won't spare you.

1180
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:13,042
I will kill you.

1181
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:21,708
Forward!

1182
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:28,458
Stop. Stop.

1183
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:30,125
Rewind.

1184
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:31,917
Play that!

1185
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:50,833
Kumar...play the footages!

1186
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,583
Where did you come?

1187
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,583
This is not your place.

1188
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:17,792
Your wish won't be fulfilled!

1189
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:30,583
A dog's spirit is on that car

1190
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:35,417
Dog's spirit!

1191
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:39,167
Dog's spirit won't leave
the car that easy!

1192
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,250
It has come searching for you!

1193
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,958
No granny. I searched for
this car and bought it!

1194
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:59,292
No. It must have called you!

1195
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:09,417
It won't leave you till
it finishes its work.

1196
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:13,792
There are many cars in this city.

1197
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,167
Why does the dog hopped
on to this car?

1198
01:14:20,417 --> 01:14:24,375
You have something closer
to that dog.

1199
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,708
Destroyed!

1200
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,375
Granny... What are you telling?

1201
01:14:27,542 --> 01:14:28,792
I can't understand anything!

1202
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,083
The two lights in front of
the car are its eyes!

1203
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:34,583
The two lights are its eyes!

1204
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:38,708
Four wheels of the car are its four legs!

1205
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,083
Wheels are its legs!

1206
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,750
Both mirrors are its ears!

1207
01:14:47,792 --> 01:14:49,917
The smoke tube at the back....

1208
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:51,375
Is its tail!

1209
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,792
Stop there!

1210
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:58,917
It would have communicated
in this manner with you!

1211
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,792
You wouldn't have understood!

1212
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,250
Dog is Bairava's vehicle!

1213
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:13,083
Keep this one rupee coin in the car.

1214
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,375
It should not be visible to anybody!

1215
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,542
Take it!

1216
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:25,125
After finishing its job,
it will leave you for sure!

1217
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:32,042
Sir...These are the tyre marks
of the place you told!

1218
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:39,458
We got his cycle at a distance of 500 metres
from the subway where murder took place

1219
01:15:40,917 --> 01:15:45,833
So, he must be chased to an unmanned
subway and was killed.

1220
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:54,500
The CCTV cameras in between were
jammed when he crossed.

1221
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,667
We just have two evidences.

1222
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,500
One is the cap of the radiator.

1223
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:00,792
Cars nowadays do not have
this type of radiator cap.

1224
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,625
Give me some time.
I will inquire.

1225
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:03,792
Our next clue

1226
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:04,833
is these tyre marks.

1227
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:08,042
We have found that he is an accuest after
that he was murdred by someone.

1228
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:10,000
Sir, there is traffic of many
cars in that route.

1229
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,875
It might be the cap of some other
car's radiator too.

1230
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:14,583
No Akilan! According to forensic report,

1231
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:19,167
the blisters on him are caused by
the boiling water from radiator.

1232
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:25,000
So, we should go in search of a car that
suits both the tyre marks and the radiator cap.

1233
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:33,958
A witch will give one rupee coin and keep
it in the car, it seems.

1234
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:35,208
But the spirit won't go.

1235
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,667
Why do you take that
old lady's advice seriously?

1236
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,083
Forget what she said...

1237
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,500
We shall seek the help of Kerala astrologers
to get rid of the spirit!

1238
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:49,583
From this minute, this car is
my new born baby!

1239
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:55,542
These are its eyes!
These are its eyes!

1240
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:58,917
This is the doom light of this car!

1241
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,833
I will take it off and feed the hens!

1242
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:05,042
These are its legs!

1243
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:08,375
The four wheels of the car are its legs!

1244
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:10,792
I will prepare a soup with these
legs and drink.

1245
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:14,583
These are the ears.

1246
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:18,667
I will bite it and spit.

1247
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,292
This is the tail! This is the tail!

1248
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,708
I will kick!

1249
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:31,792
Kerala Wizard! I have applied all
your ideas as such!

1250
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,708
I have kissed.

1251
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,958
Why does the lemon
fly high in the wind?

1252
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:48,375
How it automatically
started singing?

1253
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:53,708
The wiper sprays?

1254
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:59,375
God!

1255
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:28,292
Dad!

1256
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:31,708
Boy Pavazha!
Dad! Dad...!

1257
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:32,250
What happened?

1258
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,333
Look there.

1259
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,875
Listen carefully.
I should be in this house or that car!

1260
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,458
Decide it for yourself!

1261
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,208
Why are you torturing us like this?

1262
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:47,208
What do you want?

1263
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:48,917
What is the connection between us?

1264
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,000
Can you hear?

1265
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,792
Answer me...

1266
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:56,875
How are you?

1267
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,625
Do you know me, Grandpa?

1268
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:01,875
Yes, I know!

1269
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,333
Grandpa...! Grandpa...!
Stop the car!

1270
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:28,292
Grandpa...! Grandpa...!

1271
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:30,917
Shall we take this dog to our home?

1272
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Grandpa, please!

1273
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:33,250
Ok. Take it!

1274
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,292
Thank you Grandpa...!

1275
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,042
Dora!

1276
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,542
Do you like the name, Dora!

1277
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:54,875
Grandpa...! This will be called
Dora hereafter!

1278
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:06,375
Dora!

1279
01:21:06,417 --> 01:21:08,792
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

1280
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:15,125
Where do you take me Dora?

1281
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:22,000
You have leaned on my chest!

1282
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:28,417
You stood beautifully in front of my eyes!

1283
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:33,958
Do the languages we speak become one?

1284
01:21:34,417 --> 01:21:39,708
Is time enough for a sweet talk with
you closing my eyes?

1285
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:45,417
You are my parents who came in person!
Do you know that?

1286
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:51,000
Will you understand if
I explain about this affection?

1287
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:05,417
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

1288
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:08,250
Where do you take me Dora?

1289
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:11,000
You touched me and left!
You touched me and left!

1290
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,125
Don't leave Dora...Dora!

1291
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:25,417
By seeing you sleep listening to
my heart's beat,

1292
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:31,125
I forget to wake up early in
the morning!

1293
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:36,750
When I come near to get your kiss,

1294
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:42,250
I wish I should become like
you in my heart!

1295
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:48,250
You have come like a toy for me!

1296
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:53,500
You have become a
mother with your love!

1297
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:59,500
Life without you!
I don't want that!

1298
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:05,000
The world you live,

1299
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,333
What is this grandpa?

1300
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:35,583
Grandpa

1301
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:44,333
It's enough now!

1302
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:48,875
Dora..

1303
01:24:00,542 --> 01:24:01,958
Don't beat my Grandpa!

1304
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:06,375
Dora...Silence!

1305
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:07,917
I am afraid, Grandpa!

1306
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,417
Get lost!

1307
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:13,708
Granpa...Start the vehicle soon.

1308
01:24:14,167 --> 01:24:15,708
Dora...Don't shout.

1309
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:18,875
Dora...Please Dora...! Don't shout.

1310
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:21,625
Granpa...

1311
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:25,500
Grandpa! Start the car soon!

1312
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:29,125
What do you all want?

1313
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:34,750
Brother...Brother..please leave us.

1314
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:36,625
We gave you all that we had!

1315
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,417
We don't have anything else!

1316
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:42,458
Brother...! Who is your brother?

1317
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:44,250
Please brother! Leave us.

1318
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:47,125
Not brother! Call me uncle!

1319
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,750
You sinner!

1320
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,042
Don't beat my grandpa!

1321
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:59,417
Leave me! Leave me!

1322
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:06,458
Dora!

1323
01:25:57,667 --> 01:26:00,208
Stop the car! Stop the car!
That is the sound of the police vehicle.

1324
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:49,792
What have you done?

1325
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,500
Who are you all?

1326
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,833
Leave it

1327
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:42,208
A little girl! She must have been
raped by three people.

1328
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:46,000
We tried our level best.
But she is brain dead.

1329
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:52,167
Another girl is admitted in this hospital for
a blood clot in her heart.

1330
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,958
She needs a donor immediately.

1331
01:27:54,417 --> 01:27:59,000
Your granddaughter's blood group and
other parameters suit her.

1332
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,833
If you agree, your granddaughter can
live through another girl.

1333
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,458
Doctor!
Nothing to worry!

1334
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:16,292
Your daughter is in safe zone now
because we got a donor at the right time.

1335
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:17,292
It's God's grace.

1336
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,125
You have to be careful after this.

1337
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:21,917
She shouldn't talk louder or get tensed!

1338
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:23,667
She should take tablets regularly.

1339
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:24,917
I will take good care of her doctor!

1340
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:28,583
May I know the details of
my daughter's donor?

1341
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:30,583
Sorry! They declined to
disclose their details.

1342
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:13,875
The brutality faced by that little girl
shouldn't be known to the world...

1343
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,167
That's why I didn't report this in police.

1344
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,250
After the demise of my granddaughter,

1345
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:24,750
Dora died on that car
without eating anything.

1346
01:31:25,458 --> 01:31:29,083
As I couldn't see that car after that...
I sold it.

1347
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:50,167
Boy Pavazha!

1348
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,042
Both you and car are not found!
I was tensed!

1349
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:54,208
Where did you go?

1350
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,792
Why aren't you answering your dad?

1351
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:03,625
That girl isn't dead, yet!

1352
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:06,167
She is living in you!

1353
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:10,125
The dog's spirit thinks of you as that girl.

1354
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:14,500
That dog wants to kill those three men
in front of your eyes,

1355
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,708
That's why it has come to you.

1356
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:36,833
What you have given is 1980 model,
Austin Cambridge!

1357
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,875
There are only two Austin cars in
Tamilnadu as per RTO registration.

1358
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:45,042
One car was sent to scrap one year ago.

1359
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:47,542
Another one was registered in the name of
Pavazhakodi who resides in Maduravoyil.

1360
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:49,375
I have sent that details in WhatsApp.

1361
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:58,417
Kumar, Go to Maduravoyil!

1362
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:12,208
Tell me the truth!

1363
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,500
We have got the radiator cap of your
car near the murder spot.

1364
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:19,375
What were you doing there in
the middle of the night?

1365
01:34:19,542 --> 01:34:20,875
What is the connection between you both?

1366
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:23,292
Why did you kill him?

1367
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:24,958
Did I kill him?

1368
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:26,958
I don't know anything.

1369
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:30,542
You have brought me here by mistake I suppose.

1370
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:32,375
I have nothing to do with this!

1371
01:34:33,917 --> 01:34:35,208
Are you acting?

1372
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:36,292
What is happening here?

1373
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:38,417
Do you know about the pressure
from high command?

1374
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,708
A north Indian is killed!

1375
01:34:39,792 --> 01:34:42,083
I am inquiring regarding that sir!

1376
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,042
Who is this girl?

1377
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:45,958
I suspect her in the murder
of a north Indian man!

1378
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:47,333
Sir...I didn't do anything!

1379
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,667
We got a radiator cap of a
car near the murder spot.

1380
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:50,792
That car belongs to her.

1381
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:53,125
Sir....I have no connection with this!

1382
01:34:53,292 --> 01:34:53,958
Wait. Wait.

1383
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:54,833
Why are you crying?

1384
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:55,583
Tell me, what happened?

1385
01:34:55,792 --> 01:35:02,875
He jumped my wall at night and dragged
me here in the name of inquiry.

1386
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:04,125
Look at me sir!

1387
01:35:04,292 --> 01:35:05,875
He dragged me in night dress!

1388
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:08,208
Even my dad doesn't know
I am taken here.

1389
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:10,917
He must be searching for me!

1390
01:35:11,042 --> 01:35:14,708
My dad and I started a call taxi
company after a lot of struggle.

1391
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:18,125
He suspects me with some cap.

1392
01:35:18,292 --> 01:35:20,417
What I own is an old car sir!

1393
01:35:20,542 --> 01:35:23,083
Some parts break wherever it goes.

1394
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:26,417
Can I take responsibility for the crime
taking place in that area?

1395
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:28,625
See that cap, sir!

1396
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,542
Where is that cap?
Get that!

1397
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:35,583
It was me who killed him
at the subway!

1398
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,625
Is this considered as evidence?

1399
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,750
No sir...Just now!

1400
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:42,208
Listen! Can this be considered
as evidence?

1401
01:35:42,417 --> 01:35:43,417
Leave this sir!

1402
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:44,792
If he was killed by a car,

1403
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:48,250
There should be the tyre mark on the spot.

1404
01:35:48,417 --> 01:35:50,125
It should match my car's tyre mark.

1405
01:35:50,292 --> 01:35:52,333
Ask him whether he checked that!

1406
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:53,250
Did you check?

1407
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:54,250
Yes sir!

1408
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,958
But the tyre mark mismatches!

1409
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,625
Where is the tyre mark evidence?

1410
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:02,958
How does it match?
I have changed the tyre!

1411
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:04,667
Are you making drama in
the police station?

1412
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:07,250
The tyre marks doesn't match, right?

1413
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:10,500
Why do you inquire a woman without
proper evidence?

1414
01:36:11,042 --> 01:36:12,208
I was telling him the same.

1415
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:15,917
How can he inquire me without
the presence of a lady police?

1416
01:36:16,167 --> 01:36:19,542
If you continue to torture me,
I will go to the press and media.

1417
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:21,000
Ok. You can leave.

1418
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:24,083
Do you have any other proper evidence?

1419
01:36:24,292 --> 01:36:27,875
I beg you. Please leave me.
Don't torture me.

1420
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,083
Brother, there are two more people.

1421
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,000
Catch me if you can.

1422
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:32,958
I will nab you red handed.

1423
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:34,542
Sir...He is telling the same thing.

1424
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:35,917
What happened to you?

1425
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:36,875
You can leave.

1426
01:37:05,708 --> 01:37:09,083
Sir, I couldn't arrest her in spite
of collecting all evidences.

1427
01:37:12,083 --> 01:37:14,750
She made a drama telling cap,
tyre mark and escaped.

1428
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,375
If we could find out the other two men,

1429
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:19,625
She will be caught there.

1430
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:25,917
How come you pocketed dad's coins?

1431
01:37:26,042 --> 01:37:27,542
Your coins are just the same.

1432
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:31,208
Always dad is the winner.

1433
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:36,958
Don't know why.

1434
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:39,750
When I strike the red coin, I am anxious.

1435
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:42,917
What did you say?

1436
01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:46,292
I am anxious when I strike the red coin.

1437
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:06,833
Hello.

1438
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:07,542
Is this PK call taxi?

1439
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:08,833
Yes. PK call taxi. Tell me!

1440
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:09,833
We need a car!

1441
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,167
We don't operate for some time.

1442
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:13,000
We have an important work.

1443
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:15,333
Important issue too! We want to
ride an old car!

1444
01:38:23,417 --> 01:38:26,417
When Dora killed him in the subway...

1445
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:32,958
Can you hear me?

1446
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:36,917
When Dora killed him in the subway
for the first time,

1447
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:37,708
My heart beat increased.

1448
01:38:39,542 --> 01:38:43,458
Before that, when
I purchased this car,

1449
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:45,875
But I don't know why it increased there.

1450
01:38:47,167 --> 01:38:48,333
Was there anybody at that place?

1451
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:50,708
If yes, press the horn once!

1452
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:54,542
If no, press the horn twice, Dora!

1453
01:38:55,417 --> 01:38:56,292
Was there anybody?

1454
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:13,125
Dora...I took the roadside CCTV footage
where I bought the car.

1455
01:39:13,375 --> 01:39:15,625
Will you tell me when the man
we are searching for spotted?

1456
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:30,667
Him!

1457
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:10,375
I am selling pani puri in Guindy!

1458
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,958
At Perumbakkam housing board!

1459
01:41:18,667 --> 01:41:22,708
Dora...I thought I can get him easily
with the heartbeat.

1460
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:26,208
But, how do I find them.

1461
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:27,667
I don't know where they live.

1462
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:37,000
Dora...Where are you taking me?

1463
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:49,625
Dora...What did you do?

1464
01:41:54,292 --> 01:41:55,333
Dora...What do you want?

1465
01:42:24,292 --> 01:42:24,667
Dora...

1466
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:26,708
No one is around.

1467
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:28,417
Shall we kill him?

1468
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:42,000
Why did you stop?

1469
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,333
You should have killed him!

1470
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:49,208
What did you do?

1471
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:02,042
What is your problem?

1472
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:14,000
You have missed a great opportunity.

1473
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,917
You should have killed him!

1474
01:43:18,917 --> 01:43:20,000
What are you doing at
the residential area?

1475
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:20,917
I'm selling panipuri, sir.

1476
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,750
Do not stop here. Go to the main road!

1477
01:43:40,708 --> 01:43:41,333
Why did you stop?

1478
01:43:41,833 --> 01:43:42,750
You could have runover him!

1479
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:55,042
Thank God! Both of us would
have caught.

1480
01:43:56,167 --> 01:43:58,500
You are smart.

1481
01:43:58,708 --> 01:44:00,625
I was in haste.

1482
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:09,083
We shall plan something else for him, ok?

1483
01:45:03,417 --> 01:45:05,542
Sir, with the surveillance of that girl for
the past four days...

1484
01:45:05,667 --> 01:45:07,083
She was found roaming around places like

1485
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:09,250
Medavakkam cross road, Velachery,
where north Indians live...

1486
01:45:09,417 --> 01:45:11,000
But for the past two days,

1487
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
she was searching for somebody in
Perubakkam housing board.

1488
01:45:14,167 --> 01:45:16,042
We couldn't find him.

1489
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:19,500
She didn't go out of her house all day today.

1490
01:45:25,167 --> 01:45:30,333
If my guess is correct, she may come to
the place where north Indians live tonight.

1491
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:32,750
Shall we send police force to that area?

1492
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:37,875
Do we need police force to nab a woman?

1493
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:54,542
Sir, she started her car from home?

1494
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:55,917
Ok...Follow her in a safe distance.

1495
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:56,958
Start the vehicle. Come on.

1496
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:05,125
Sir...Car is enroute Perumbakkam!

1497
01:46:08,917 --> 01:46:11,667
Yes sir. Car is enroute Perumbakkam!

1498
01:46:12,458 --> 01:46:13,250
Don't miss her.

1499
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:16,083
Co-ordinate with the team of
Shekar Dhanraj in housing board!

1500
01:46:16,792 --> 01:46:18,417
Shekar...car is entering....

1501
01:46:18,542 --> 01:46:19,667
Watch it carefully!

1502
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:20,792
Ok sir!

1503
01:46:23,583 --> 01:46:26,833
Photos and all details of north Indians
who have come to work in contract basis are here.

1504
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,208
Give me one kulfi!

1505
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:49,000
Akilan....where is she now?

1506
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:50,250
She is eating kulfi!

1507
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:52,667
Ok. Follow her.

1508
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:12,125
Go. Go!

1509
01:47:23,708 --> 01:47:26,417
Dora...I have some work.

1510
01:47:26,917 --> 01:47:28,292
Please take care.

1511
01:47:41,917 --> 01:47:42,667
Just a minute!

1512
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:43,833
Go back.

1513
01:47:46,708 --> 01:47:48,917
Wait. Take his details.

1514
01:47:52,958 --> 01:47:54,667
How come the pani puri man...?

1515
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:55,958
What is your name?
Ram!

1516
01:47:56,292 --> 01:47:57,875
Which area?
Meenambakkam!

1517
01:47:58,583 --> 01:47:59,667
It says Guindy...!

1518
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:02,958
He told Meenambakkam!

1519
01:48:05,833 --> 01:48:07,167
Something is wrong!

1520
01:48:14,042 --> 01:48:14,583
Hello...Who is this?

1521
01:48:14,667 --> 01:48:17,250
Some time ago...you murdered a girl after rape.
Do you remember?

1522
01:48:17,333 --> 01:48:18,625
No. No. Not me!

1523
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:20,250
Police have come to encounter you.

1524
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:21,917
Not me. I don't know anything!

1525
01:48:22,042 --> 01:48:22,958
Go out and see for yourself!

1526
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:24,292
Don't do anything wrong.

1527
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:24,750
Hello.

1528
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:26,125
I am telling this for the sake of you.

1529
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:28,125
Your friend was killed by police.

1530
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:29,667
Escape through the back door!

1531
01:48:30,458 --> 01:48:30,750
Hello.

1532
01:48:35,458 --> 01:48:37,667
The car is going left to the B block.
Cover that!

1533
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:07,292
Brother...Police have surrounded
my house.

1534
01:49:07,417 --> 01:49:09,625
A girl called me and asked me to
escape through the back door.

1535
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:13,750
No problem, brother. Do what I say.

1536
01:49:14,083 --> 01:49:15,542
Escape through the back door!

1537
01:49:15,792 --> 01:49:16,875
Switch off your phone!

1538
01:49:17,125 --> 01:49:18,292
Police may track our calls.

1539
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:43,333
I am afraid. Brother, where are you?

1540
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:26,833
Hello, Akshay what happened?

1541
01:50:47,667 --> 01:50:48,292
Hello

1542
01:50:48,292 --> 01:50:48,958
Akshay

1543
01:50:48,958 --> 01:50:49,708
Bro

1544
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:51,083
Anything happened?

1545
01:50:51,083 --> 01:50:51,792
Akshay.

1546
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,917
Sir...She hasn't stopped anywhere.

1547
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:15,625
The car reached her house.

1548
01:51:15,917 --> 01:51:16,292
Ok.

1549
01:51:22,917 --> 01:51:25,417
Sir...A north Indian is found dead in
Perumbakkam housing board.

1550
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:15,208
Sir..He is the one who brings men
for construction work.

1551
01:52:15,375 --> 01:52:17,958
The bed sheet vendor and
the pani puri vendor are his friends.

1552
01:52:18,083 --> 01:52:20,042
All the three of them did those crimes together.

1553
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:20,917
This is his address.

1554
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:21,583
His name is

1555
01:52:21,792 --> 01:52:22,542
Mukesh yadhav

1556
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:27,333
Move...Move. What happened?

1557
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:28,125
I have enquired, sir!

1558
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:29,083
He left just now.

1559
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,917
Do you know Mukesh?

1560
01:52:31,042 --> 01:52:32,417
Yes, I know!

1561
01:52:32,625 --> 01:52:33,333
Where is he?

1562
01:52:33,458 --> 01:52:34,583
He is gone this way!

1563
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:37,792
Did you inquire properly? Is that him?

1564
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:39,792
Yes sir. I got the photo.

1565
01:52:39,958 --> 01:52:41,500
He has escaped from here.

1566
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:46,708
Check him in bus stand, railway station
and airport with our team.

1567
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:48,792
We should nab him before
he crosses the city.

1568
01:52:48,958 --> 01:52:50,750
Come to the station after
collecting the details.

1569
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,292
Kumar, come on!

1570
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:09,875
Hello.

1571
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:10,667
Do you know Hindi?

1572
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:13,083
Who is this?

1573
01:53:13,417 --> 01:53:14,292
Ok. Let me speak in Tamil.

1574
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:16,625
Your bathroom heater is burning.

1575
01:53:16,792 --> 01:53:17,583
What are you doing?

1576
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,083
Go fast and see.

1577
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:21,083
Who are you?

1578
01:53:22,542 --> 01:53:23,542
Is that important now?

1579
01:53:23,833 --> 01:53:26,000
Go fast and see!

1580
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:28,208
Don't be afraid!

1581
01:53:32,375 --> 01:53:33,708
Thank God. You have switched it off.

1582
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:35,250
What do you want now?

1583
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:36,792
Gas is leaking, it seems.

1584
01:53:36,917 --> 01:53:37,583
Go and see.

1585
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:38,917
Fast. Fast. Go.

1586
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:05,417
All the doors are open.
Didn't you lock it?

1587
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:20,125
What do you want? Tell me!

1588
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:24,750
You are a poor thing.
What do you do?

1589
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:27,208
If you have elders at home,

1590
01:54:27,625 --> 01:54:29,583
They would have done things for you!

1591
01:54:29,833 --> 01:54:30,917
Dad!

1592
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:35,458
Dad!Dad!

1593
01:54:40,625 --> 01:54:42,250
Where is my dad!

1594
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,250
Who are you?

1595
01:54:43,375 --> 01:54:44,708
Is he not found anywhere?

1596
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:50,458
I am your third target Mukesh Yadav!

1597
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:53,042
I followed him when the police come.

1598
01:54:53,417 --> 01:54:55,083
But police were behind you.

1599
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:56,750
You are caught now.

1600
01:54:56,917 --> 01:54:58,708
You often do things according to plan!

1601
01:54:59,042 --> 01:55:01,333
I have kidnapped your dad
with a proper sketch.

1602
01:55:01,458 --> 01:55:03,750
If anything happens to my dad,

1603
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,417
I will kill you!

1604
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:08,875
It won't take much time to come into
the house and kill you.

1605
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,042
You have killed two of my best friends.

1606
01:55:11,792 --> 01:55:12,375
You have killed

1607
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:15,833
You should know the pain of losing
people you love.

1608
01:55:16,125 --> 01:55:17,917
That's why I kidnapped your dad.

1609
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:20,000
Die searching for his where about!

1610
01:56:52,208 --> 01:56:55,833
Dora...could you sniff and find
the whereabouts of my dad!

1611
01:57:37,792 --> 01:57:38,458
Which system?

1612
01:57:38,625 --> 01:57:39,417
Sir...Here sir!

1613
01:57:43,417 --> 01:57:45,125
Were you able to track
his mobile network?

1614
01:57:45,250 --> 01:57:46,042
No sir. We couldn't do it.

1615
01:57:49,708 --> 01:57:50,375
Volume!

1616
01:57:52,875 --> 01:57:56,250
She is coming in search of you!

1617
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,958
To settle an old feud!

1618
01:57:59,958 --> 01:58:03,083
She is on the run for you!

1619
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:06,875
She will make you run for your life!

1620
01:58:20,333 --> 01:58:23,708
She is coming in search of you!

1621
01:58:23,708 --> 01:58:27,417
To settle an old feud!

1622
01:58:27,417 --> 01:58:30,542
She is on the run for you!

1623
01:58:30,542 --> 01:58:34,333
She will make you run for your life!

1624
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:37,542
Those were ears earlier.
They are the mirrors now!

1625
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:41,083
It comes searching to nab you!

1626
01:58:41,083 --> 01:58:44,583
Two eyes were changed into lights,
To brighten up the night!

1627
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:47,875
It will come behind to finish you!

1628
01:58:47,875 --> 01:58:51,083
Those were ears earlier.
They are the mirrors now!

1629
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:54,625
It comes searching to nab you!

1630
01:58:54,625 --> 01:58:58,125
Two eyes were changed into lights,
To brighten up the night!

1631
01:58:58,125 --> 01:59:01,542
It will come behind to finish you!

1632
01:59:01,542 --> 01:59:05,000
Try to confront!
It is Dora who attacks!

1633
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Come, do not stop!

1634
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,833
Dora has come in search of you!

1635
01:59:11,833 --> 01:59:14,750
Come in front!

1636
01:59:15,333 --> 01:59:18,542
Dora has come in search of you!

1637
01:59:18,542 --> 01:59:21,625
Come in front!

1638
02:00:07,542 --> 02:00:08,250
Dora

1639
02:00:09,083 --> 02:00:11,375
Can we drive on four wheel?

1640
02:00:24,625 --> 02:00:27,583
Try to confront!
It is Dora who attacks!

1641
02:00:27,583 --> 02:00:28,417
Try to confront!
It is Dora who attacks!

1642
02:00:28,417 --> 02:00:31,292
Come, do not stop!

1643
02:00:32,125 --> 02:00:35,208
Dora has come in search of you!

1644
02:01:10,667 --> 02:01:33,667

1645
02:02:51,417 --> 02:02:54,625
You are caught alone for
the love of your dad!

1646
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:56,292
You are caught!

1647
02:02:57,375 --> 02:03:03,250
I will tell you something.
I will kill you in my style.

1648
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:05,875
If you are a real man, try to touch me!

1649
02:03:12,708 --> 02:03:14,583
I won't spare you without killing.

1650
02:03:17,583 --> 02:03:18,125
Dora

1651
02:05:39,667 --> 02:05:41,667
Get down. Get down.

1652
02:05:42,542 --> 02:05:43,667
Get down.

1653
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,250
Stop!

1654
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,167
Stop!

1655
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:53,833
Get the keys!

1656
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:57,833
Get the keys!

1657
02:05:58,417 --> 02:06:00,250
Boy Pavazha. Don't take it!

1658
02:06:00,333 --> 02:06:01,542
Get the keys!

1659
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:05,792
Boy Pavazha. Don't take the keys!

1660
02:06:06,042 --> 02:06:07,333
Don't take the keys!

1661
02:06:07,875 --> 02:06:09,250
Get the keys!

1662
02:06:19,083 --> 02:06:20,708
Throw the keys!

1663
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:24,875
No

1664
02:06:24,875 --> 02:06:26,375
Throw it off!

1665
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,125
Boy Pavazha!

1666
02:06:33,333 --> 02:06:34,125
Dad!

1667
02:06:40,375 --> 02:06:42,375
Leave me!

1668
02:06:43,792 --> 02:06:46,000
Are you playing with this circus vehicle?

1669
02:06:46,708 --> 02:06:48,583
You have murdered two of my friends?

1670
02:06:52,917 --> 02:06:54,958
That is not a circus vehicle.

1671
02:06:56,375 --> 02:06:59,042
There is a spirit in that!

1672
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:10,708
Is that a ghost?

1673
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:15,667
I am terrified.

1674
02:07:15,792 --> 02:07:17,292
Don't kill me!

1675
02:07:18,667 --> 02:07:20,667
God, please save me!

1676
02:07:22,667 --> 02:07:26,583
Will that come and save you?

1677
02:07:28,292 --> 02:07:29,958
It won't spare you!

1678
02:07:33,375 --> 02:07:38,583
Will it save you? Call that!

1679
02:07:39,708 --> 02:07:41,958
Will it save you? Will it save you?

1680
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:59,208
Come on.

1681
02:08:00,958 --> 02:08:02,375
Call that!

1682
02:08:06,167 --> 02:08:07,000
Dora!

1683
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,542
It didn't come?

1684
02:08:12,917 --> 02:08:15,208
Call that! Call that!

1685
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:17,333
Dora!
Dora?

1686
02:08:18,458 --> 02:08:23,000
Dora!
Dora Buji!

1687
02:08:24,292 --> 02:08:27,542
Call that!

1688
02:08:36,042 --> 02:08:38,125
It will kill you!

1689
02:08:54,500 --> 02:09:01,625
Come on! Come on!

1690
02:09:10,958 --> 02:09:11,875
It won't come

1691
02:09:11,875 --> 02:09:13,167
It won't come

1692
02:09:13,167 --> 02:09:14,875
I will kill that

1693
02:09:30,167 --> 02:09:42,708
Die! Die! Die!

1694
02:10:57,917 --> 02:10:59,000
Were is it?

1695
02:11:00,333 --> 02:11:01,208
Why it didn't come?

1696
02:11:03,542 --> 02:11:04,500
Why it didn't come?

1697
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:08,833
I will kill you!

1698
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:20,875
Dora...

1699
02:14:25,167 --> 02:14:26,875
Kill him!

1700
02:15:31,042 --> 02:15:34,667
Dora's journey will continue...!
