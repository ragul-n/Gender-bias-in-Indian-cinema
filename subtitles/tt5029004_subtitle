1
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:20,917
Hey!

2
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,333
Bhaskar!

3
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,917
Get up!
Come on!

4
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,875
- Come.
- Has everyone slept?

5
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,292
- Yes, come on.
- I'm coming.

6
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,792
Come soon.
Be careful.

7
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,708
We can't get a better
place for Rs.100.

8
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,375
- Shut up!
- Okay. Now come.

9
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:33,792
Pull up the bed sheets.

10
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,333
Dude, I have the liquor...

11
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,917
...but nothing to mix with it.

12
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,250
What are you going
to mix it with?

13
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,792
Man made liquor..

14
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,917
mixed with the natural water,
gives us the real high.

15
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Try it.

16
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,833
Despite growing old...

17
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,750
I didn't know it.

18
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,667
No ticket.

19
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,542
You have run away from home?

20
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,083
Did you fail the exam?

21
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:25,833
Did you steal money
from your parents?

22
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,750
Did you kill someone?

23
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:31,833
I fell in love.

24
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,042
So you must have suffered a lot?

25
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,417
The almighty has to save you.

26
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,000
My birth was a funny incident.

27
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,583
Oh God!
Fool!

28
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,833
I asked you to get an auto rickshaw.
What are you doing?

29
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,917
Get up, man!

30
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,208
now move!

31
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,375
My wife is having labor pain.
Please help me.

32
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,000
Why should I help you?

33
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,375
Its getting late.
Please help.

34
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,833
Gosh! The liquor shops
will close soon!

35
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,542
I will give more than the
fare, please take us to the hospital.

36
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,625
I'm going to buy liquor.

37
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,958
I need to go to hospital.

38
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:07,792
Impossible.

39
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,417
Why?

40
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,750
Passengers have already boarded.
Take a look.

41
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,833
Who is that? Oh God!
- Hey!

42
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:14,750
When did you people get in?

43
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,542
Even her wife is pregnant.
- You too!

44
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,583
- I will adjust.
- What?

45
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,833
- There is no place.
- Come on!

46
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,083
Careful!

47
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,458
Get in.

48
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,250
2 pregnant ladies
in the first scene.

49
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,875
Director is conveying a
message.

50
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,792
What baby is it?
Boy or girl?

51
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,500
- Boy
- Then the other one is girl.

52
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,625
It seems to be a love story.

53
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:37,792
Stop talking.

54
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,708
Arrogant idiots.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,875
I'm helping you at the
risk of losing my liquor.

56
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,667
Are you showing off
your attitude?

57
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,167
Your turn is awaiting soon.

58
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,750
- Stop!!
- Here he comes.

59
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,125
- Hey Mr.
- What is it?

60
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,833
My wife is having the labor pain.

61
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,667
- Don't panic.
- Please help

62
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,458
- Please help!
- Don't blabber.

63
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,917
- I know all the heroes of Bollywood.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:03,375
- See I scared him with my English.
- Get in.

65
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,250
You too.
You got her conceived?

66
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,708
Get in, moron.

67
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,958
You don't deserve respect!

68
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,083
What is it, madam?
Boy or girl?

69
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,833
Girl.

70
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,833
Great!

71
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,875
A boy and 2 girls.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,500
Guess there is
a twist in the movie.

73
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,542
Probably a triangular
love story.

74
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,000
Who is crying?
I'll thrash you.

75
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,917
When the other two can bear it?
Why can't you?

76
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,792
Please sing the song.

77
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,167
How can I sing it now?

78
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,833
- Only when the song is sung..
- Oh God!

79
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,792
- the baby movement slows down
- Oh God!

80
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,875
Hey, Mr. sing that song.

81
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,458
I too can feel the vibrations.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,333
We have reached the hospital.

83
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,958
- Please get down.
- Doctor!

84
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,875
Doctor! wake up please.

85
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,083
- What happened?
- Three ladies are facing the labor pain.

86
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,875
- 3 ladies?
- Yes, Dr.

87
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,542
- But I'm the only one available.
- But there are 3 ladies.

88
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,667
Please take them to
another hospital.

89
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:53,833
We can't save their lives.

90
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,417
- What do you mean?
- I can!

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,542
They can be saved.

92
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,250
We must aid the women in need.

93
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,250
- That's humanity.
- But there are no rooms

94
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,625
- Take them to a ward.
- That's fine.

95
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,083
But, only 2 stretchers
are available.

96
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,667
I see..

97
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,875
Help me!

98
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,708
Have faith in God!
Don't worry.

99
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:21,542
Don't cry.

100
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,833
I'll not let the women cry.

101
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,833
- Oh God!
- What happened?

102
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,292
- Doctor?!
- Doctor?!

103
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,708
Are they safe?

104
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:37,583
The women have given
birth to 3 cute babies.

105
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,208
Thank you, very much Dr.

106
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,875
I was born along with 2 girls.

107
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:42,917
I was very happy.

108
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:48,667
- Where is my kid? - Where
is my kid?- Move aside.

109
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,625
- Where is my kid?
- Fools, look at the token.

110
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,000
- Token? - Here is my kid.
- My son!

111
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,417
- My darling!
- My cutie!

112
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,542
My lovely daughter.
Thank you, God!

113
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,042
You have given me an angel.

114
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,750
You will become a great doctor.

115
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,167
You will become a reputed engineer.

116
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,875
You will become a cop!

117
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,583
You will become a scientist!
My son!

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,667
My cutie, you are my replica.
- Hello! - Bro!

119
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,292
- My dear brother.
- Bro!

120
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,667
Look at our son.

121
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,875
Not ours! Its yours.
- Okay.

122
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,375
My son!!

123
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,833
- Look at him!
- My sweetie!

124
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,500
I will go visit Hema.
- Okay.

125
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,208
Teach him something good.
- I know.

126
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,833
You are a lucky chap!

127
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:29,750
You are sleeping beside 2 girls.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,458
But...

129
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,333
No matter what you become..
May be a doctor!

130
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,125
An engineer!

131
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,833
Or a great scientist!

132
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,167
But don't trust girls.

133
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,708
Learn from my mistakes.

134
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,500
I got dumped 'n' number of times.

135
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,833
Since my childhood, Aditi
and Ramya are my world.

136
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,083
We were brought up
in a same colony.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,458
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you!!

138
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,375
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to Ramya!

139
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,417
Happy birthday to you!

140
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,208
Give her a bite!

141
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,667
You too share it, girls!

142
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,208
Kiss Aditi!

143
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,000
- Aditi!
- Coming...

144
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,292
Kiss her!

145
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,333
- Ramya
- Coming..

146
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,042
Why are you looking dejected, Ramya?

147
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,083
I don't like to celebrate my birthday.

148
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:54,708
Why?

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,125
I would have got many gifts
had I celebrated at my home.

150
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,625
Here only you and
Aditi get gifts.

151
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,042
No issues, take whichever
gift you want.

152
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,042
I don't need it.

153
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,875
It's your birthday too!

154
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,042
Take whichever you like.

155
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,500
I want that one.

156
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,792
I can't give that.

157
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,042
My uncle had made it himself just for me.

158
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,083
You promised me.

159
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,833
I can't it give it.
Take any other gift.

160
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,000
- Jeeva.
- I'm coming, dad.

161
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,542
Seek blessings from uncle.

162
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,583
Ramya.

163
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,500
I liked the song.
What's it, dear?

164
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,833
That's my gift.
She stole it.

165
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,083
- Is it his gift?
- Oh no!

166
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,458
- Give it back to him.
- Give it.

167
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,917
- Give it back to him.
- Return it.

168
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,375
Jeeva!

169
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,750
- Why did you do so?
- I'm coming, mom.

170
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,792
2 ones are 2.

171
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,750
2 twos are 4.

172
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,917
2 threes are 6.

173
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,917
2 ones are 2.

174
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,958
2 twos are 4.

175
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,417
2 threes are 6.

176
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you Jeeva.

177
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:41,875
You gifted her?

178
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,458
What about mine?

179
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,750
I'll give it tomorrow, Aditi.

180
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:55,667
Moon is the closest
planet next to Earth.

181
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:56,917
Note that.

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,458
Uncle, I gifted Rajini box
to Ramya. - Okay.

183
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,125
But, now Aditi wants a gift.

184
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,458
Give me money.

185
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,417
I can't give money.

186
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,833
Don't provoke me.

187
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,167
Listen..

188
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,542
Uncle, lend me money.

189
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,250
Listen to me, sweetie.

190
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,333
Tell her that you will
gift her the moon.

191
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,167
And tell the moon will follow her.

192
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,042
Jeeva!

193
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,208
Where is my gift?

194
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,458
I have prayed to the God.

195
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,250
The moon is yours.

196
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,125
What?

197
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,542
The moon will follow
you everywhere.

198
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:42,917
What are you blabbering?

199
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,167
I swear.
Mark my words.

200
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,500
Moon will follow you.
Promise!

201
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,583
Are you ready?
We are going for shopping.

202
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,292
The moon will follow
you everywhere.

203
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,000
Thanks, Jeeva.

204
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,292
Ring-a-ring o'roses.

205
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,000
A pocket full of posies.
- A pocket full of posies.

206
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,958
I have to teach a lesson to Jeeva.

207
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,042
What are you going to do?

208
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,208
Ramya or Aditi.

209
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,167
I will make one among them
to fall in love with me.

210
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,667
You aren't smart
enough to do it.

211
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,292
How can you say that?
I will prove you wrong.

212
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,500
Let's see.

213
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,208
- Can I join you?
- Yes..

214
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,458
- Thank you.
- Ring-a-ring o'roses.

215
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:03,458
- A pocket full of posies.
- A-tishoo! A-tishoo!

216
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,250
We all fall down.

217
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,875
Go to hell!

218
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,083
We have to insult him.

219
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes. We have to scold him badly.

220
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,708
Teach us foul words.

221
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:27,500
Dog..

222
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,125
Pig..

223
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,667
Something worse than that Jeeva!

224
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:33,917
Useless fellow..

225
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,042
Buffalo..

226
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,083
More stronger..

227
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,167
Teach us more vulgar words.

228
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:44,125
- 'David Pulla'.
- 'David Pulla'?

229
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:50,833
My neighbour always abuses like
that when he is on the phone.

230
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,292
I did ask him.
He said...

231
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:58,375
If a boy talks with many
girls, he is 'David Pulla'.

232
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,333
If a girl talks with many
boys, she is 'David Pulla'.

233
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,792
- Why do you keeping pulling my cheeks?
- Because you are so bubbly!

234
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,500
Yes, he is a 'David Pulla'...

235
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:14,917
Jeeva!

236
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,167
We are going scold him.

237
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,500
Go ahead..

238
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,208
Joshua..

239
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:24,250
- What?
- You 'David Pulla'.

240
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,833
Yes, my dad is 'David'.

241
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,625
I am his son(pulla).
I am 'David Pulla'.

242
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,750
He agrees.

243
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,250
Did he?
Let him go.

244
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,667
I was leading a happy life.

245
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,833
Aditi went to Bangalore for a week.

246
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,750
Ramya and I were alone.

247
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,167
That was the first time my
hormones started working...

248
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,167
The day I attained my puberty.

249
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,250
Is everyone present?
- Aditi isn't absent.

250
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,583
Is everyone present?

251
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,750
Maintain silence till
the photoshoot is done.

252
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,417
Is it clear?
Okay.

253
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,917
- Sorry, Ramya.
Stand still. - Sorry.

254
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,167
- Don't fall on me, idiot.
- Stand still.

255
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,917
That touch changed my perspective
of looking at Ramya.

256
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,750
It was God's play to
send Aditi to Bangalore.

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,750
Ready...

258
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,542
Smile...

259
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,208
I wanted to check if Aditi
has the same feelings.

260
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,750
- Hey.
- Uncle.

261
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,208
What is real love?

262
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,958
Amidst heavy traffic...

263
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:37,375
... A fellow will scream your name.

264
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,833
You won't hear it.

265
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,875
In the same scenario...

266
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,292
A girl who is in love with you...

267
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,000
... will call you at a normal tone

268
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,417
You will hear it.

269
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,083
That's called true love.

270
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,208
Hello..

271
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,458
Is it audible?

272
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,500
- Let me get my work done.
- I am at the flour mill.

273
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,583
I'm waiting since a long time.

274
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,625
Yes, the one near your house.

275
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,500
I'll thrash you.
- Don't talk to me.

276
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,375
- Go to hell.
- How long should I wait?

277
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,708
Don't spoil my mood.
- Shut up.

278
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,083
This is the right place.

279
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,583
I will go sit there
and will talk to you.

280
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:21,917
Checkout if you can hear.

281
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,958
I love, Ramya.
- Is it audible?

282
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,417
No.

283
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,042
My love for Ramya is genuine.

284
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,792
No.

285
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,958
You idiot. I really love Ramya.
Can you hear it?

286
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:45,083
Isn't it audible?
- No.

287
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,333
None can hear anyone's
voice in this noisy place.

288
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,958
But, if I'm able to hear Ramya's voice...

289
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:01,375
...like the heroine's
voice from movies

290
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,417
Ramya is in love with me.

291
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,375
Ramya!

292
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,042
Ramya!

293
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,667
Ramya!!

294
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,167
Can you hear it?

295
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,542
There are people around!

296
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,208
Enough?

297
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,250
Jeeva!

298
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,250
Did you call me?

299
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,542
Yes.
Why did you come here?

300
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,208
To meet you.

301
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,208
Is it done?

302
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,167
Yes.

303
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,083
Then leave.

304
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,500
What have you decided about Jeeva?

305
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,000
Nothing yet.

306
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,292
Boys are like computers.

307
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,750
First come first served.

308
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,958
They don't differentiate between
good and bad girls.

309
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,875
They will accept the
proposal of the first girl.

310
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,167
Propose him before Aditi does.

311
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,167
It's farewell tomorrow.

312
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,417
I'm repeating it.

313
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,583
Aditi is not in the town.

314
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,667
This is the correct time.

315
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,167
I'm confused
whether it is real love!

316
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,708
Answer my question correctly.

317
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,625
Whose face do you remember
when you get excited?

318
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,208
Jeeva.

319
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,250
That's it, you are loving him.

320
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,708
This is the best time
for you to propose.

321
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,833
Once they enter college,
they will not be the same.

322
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,500
Whom do you like the most?
Aditi or Ramya?

323
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,625
I like Aditi...

324
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,833
But I like Ramya more than her.

325
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,333
Then don't waste the time.

326
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,833
Everyone's writing "ALL THE
BEST" on other's t-shirts..

327
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,250
Write ' I love you'
on her t-shirt.

328
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,083
Okay, dude.

329
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,292
It's easy to say 'yes'.

330
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:14,833
She is coming, write it.

331
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:15,958
Jeeva, for me?

332
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,208
Won't you write on my t-shirt?

333
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,417
- Do it. - I'm scared.
Write,

334
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,417
Turn. Now I'll.

335
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:42,875
Bye, Jeeva.

336
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,625
Buddy.

337
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:51,417
I got scared and wrote 'Good night..
sweet dreams'.

338
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,833
You totally spoiled it.

339
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,042
Did I ask you to propose orally?

340
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,417
I just asked you to
write it.

341
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:00,958
Useless.

342
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:07,250
You failed to propose to Ramya.
Can you propose it to Aditi?

343
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:11,042
Stop.

344
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,875
Why didn't you write it?

345
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
What's your problem?

346
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:17,833
You ruined it.

347
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,250
I did tell you that girls will
change after going to college.

348
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:22,708
Listen..

349
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,833
What..

350
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,375
Everyone is staring at us.

351
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,708
- Oh God!
- Jeeva?

352
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,208
Why is everyone staring at us?

353
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,542
Turn.

354
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,958
That was indeed a strong proposal.

355
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,208
It was heavenly!

356
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:17,250
I felt the happiness of watching
volumes of adult video.

357
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:22,208
You made Ramya to fall
in love with you.

358
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,125
Don't forget us.

359
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,208
I won't.

360
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,333
Give a substitute for 'friendship' which
is also a synonym for inseparable.

361
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,333
- A single word.
- A word?

362
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:33,792
Definition for 'friend'?

363
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,917
I'm the first syllable
- Okay.

364
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,417
You are the second syllable.

365
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,583
Dude, it's mind blowing.

366
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,417
This is an unique definition.

367
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,625
Where is the leg piece?

368
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:47,667
Just now I parceled
it to Ramya's house.

369
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,125
It's the routine reply.

370
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,875
Jeeva, you are concentrating in physics.

371
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,542
Try out mathematics as well.

372
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,792
Too much of academics.

373
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,042
Are you working out mathematics?

374
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,625
I have just started it.
- Concentrate on it.

375
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,542
Only then you can succeed.

376
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,500
At least try to clear it
in the upcoming exam.

377
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,208
It's very tough, mom.

378
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,750
Very very big problems.

379
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Leg piece!

380
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,708
- Who rang the bell?
- It's Dad. He bought chicken

381
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,000
Chicken?
That's a rarity.

382
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:16,250
- Hello. - Jeeva, come to the A2
water pipe immediately.

383
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,250
- It's 1 AM.
- What?

384
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,833
- I can't come.
- What do you mean?

385
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,125
My mom is sleeping next to me.

386
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,458
As a girl when I can do it,
why can't you?

387
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,833
Wear the green shirt that I
gifted and come downstairs.

388
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,958
What do you want?

389
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,125
How was the leg piece?

390
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,042
Did you come here to know that?

391
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:42,333
- Tell me.
- It was good.

392
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,292
Go! Someone might see us.

393
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,750
I have proposed through writing.

394
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,750
I wanted to propose orally.

395
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:51,542
Just words won't
make you understand.

396
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,208
- Wait a moment.
- What's it?

397
00:28:58,917 --> 00:28:59,708
What's it?

398
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,792
This is the leftovers
of my dad's drink.

399
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,917
You have it, only then you
will understand my feelings.

400
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,458
I never had rum.

401
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:09,500
Someday you will have
it because of a girl.

402
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,625
Let it be now.

403
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:11,750
Have it.

404
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,625
Ramya.

405
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,042
Drink Jeeva.

406
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,708
They mix it with something?

407
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,500
Nothing is available now!
Just drink.

408
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
What happened?

409
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,500
Side dish?

410
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,583
Side dish?

411
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,542
Jeeva, will you take
me to some place?

412
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,292
Where are we going?

413
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:54,333
I'm heedlessly going crazy.

414
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,875
The obscured eyes

415
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,667
is showing the signs of love.

416
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,833
The glistening and blooming flower

417
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,958
is wounded.

418
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,458
Your touch has

419
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,333
raised my temperature.

420
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,083
I shrivel in your thoughts

421
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,667
Your pursuit for me..

422
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:20,917
Let's stay together forever.

423
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,250
Let's get intimate and
enjoy the gloomy solitude.

424
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:31,375
Let me enjoy your painful
pleasures all night.

425
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:34,333
Your hushed eyes

426
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,833
make me go crazy.

427
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:42,083
I'll live with you through ebb and flow.

428
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:58,208
Lets culminate our dreams
and make it greedy dream.

429
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:03,708
Let's get lost in
the gloomy night.

430
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,167
Your love for me is making
spend sleepless nights.

431
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:14,583
Love makes one to
banish the boundaries.

432
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:19,500
Your eyes are the
reflectors of my love.

433
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:24,917
Awaken me before
the Sun does it.

434
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:07,667
You and me are synonymous with us.

435
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:13,042
My happiness is
just embracing you.

436
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:18,417
Let's get closer in the solitude.

437
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:23,833
I lost myself in absurdness.

438
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:29,125
Don't go crazy following me up.

439
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,792
Don't hurt your love.

440
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:39,708
I'm heedlessly going crazy.

441
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,375
The obscured eyes

442
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,875
is showing the signs of love.

443
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,917
The glistening and blooming flower

444
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,500
is wounded.

445
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,833
Your touch has

446
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,875
soared up my temperature.

447
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,833
I shrivel in your thoughts

448
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:01,167
Your pursuit for me..

449
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:06,500
Let's stay together forever.

450
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:11,667
Let's get intimate and
enjoy the gloomy solitude.

451
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:17,042
Let me enjoy your painful
pleasures all night.

452
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,833
Your hushed eyes

453
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,417
make me go crazy.

454
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:27,917
I'll live with you
through ebb and flow.

455
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,083
Renu is to be pitied.

456
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,625
She is suffering a lot.

457
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,375
What's that cut on your neck?

458
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,458
A cat pounced on me.

459
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Did you and cat make love?

460
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,083
Not cat.
It's Ramya.

461
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,125
- Did you do it?
- No.

462
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:56,458
What happened?
- Just petting.

463
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:00,917
Promise me that you won't disclose it.

464
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,125
None will share such things.

465
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:04,792
Promise me.

466
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:06,292
Done.

467
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,500
Yes, sir.

468
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,000
Chennai is horrible.

469
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:11,958
I got transferred.

470
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,625
Pack your things.

471
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,083
We are leaving in a week.

472
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,500
Dad, I am in 12th grade.
Don't you know it?

473
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,958
How can I join a new school?

474
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,875
I will not leave Chennai...

475
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:23,500
away from Jeeva..

476
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,000
My friends are in Chennai.

477
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,667
You can leave with mom.

478
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,708
I won't go anywhere.

479
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,167
My daughter is in twelfth grade.

480
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:41,000
Can you cancel the orders?

481
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:42,833
I'm sure.

482
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,542
Idiot, he promised not to
disclose to anyone!

483
00:35:58,792 --> 00:35:59,792
Ramya.

484
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,375
I asked you to propose.

485
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:04,167
- Did I ask you to make love?
- What do you mean?

486
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,917
Did you visit Jeeva yesterday?

487
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,833
The whole school knows it.

488
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,250
You have been disgraced.

489
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,458
What happened yesterday?

490
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,792
You got me punished for a
silly mistake.

491
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,417
Not just me, but the whole school
knows about your relationship.

492
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,708
- Get lost.
- Why are you crying?

493
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,250
He has spread
throughout the school.

494
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:24,417
He may spread it through
social media too.

495
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:25,958
Had I been in your shoes

496
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,083
I would have dumped him.

497
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,792
Wouldn't you do the same?

498
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,125
Where are you going?

499
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:40,292
Jeeva was lying that it was just a petting.

500
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,958
Uchcha!

501
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,167
Yes, Ramya.

502
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,000
Where is Jeeva?

503
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:44,708
I don't know.

504
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:45,750
Tell me, bloody.

505
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:50,500
- Great, buddy.
- Jeeva.

506
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,333
This is boys' urinal.
Get out.

507
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,750
Get out!

508
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,792
We will got to the girls' lavatory.
- Non sense.

509
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,833
Whole school knows it.

510
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:07,833
You thought Iím cheap as I proposed to you?

511
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,292
No, I didn't mean so.

512
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,417
Sorry, Ramya.
- Shut up.

513
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,958
This is the reason why girls
take time to accept proposals.

514
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:22,292
If you really loved me,
would you have shared it?

515
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,542
Did you know how
Dinesh humiliated me?

516
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:25,625
It was disgusting.

517
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:29,000
Sorry. I really love you, Ramya.

518
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
We didn't fall in love.

519
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,542
It was something else.

520
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,875
Get away from me.

521
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,958
We have crossed half the
path of a relationship.

522
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,792
How can you leave me?

523
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,833
We have been very intimate.

524
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,333
You will remember me when you
move closely with someone.

525
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:50,625
Just to forget you, I'll
move closely with someone.

526
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,792
Ramya, I have canceled the
transfer orders as per your wish.

527
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,708
Our next 4 years
will be in Chennai.

528
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:07,625
We are moving out of Chennai.
Act now. Got it?

529
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,208
As you wished, I canceled it just now.

530
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,542
Choose one.
Transfer or divorce.

531
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,792
What happened to her?

532
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:30,417
Rascal.

533
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:51,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,458
- Who is it?
- It's Jeeva.

535
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,958
You? Why are you calling
from a new number?

536
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,375
I have no talk time in my mobile.

537
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,083
Idiot.

538
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:03,125
Ramya is moving out of the colony.

539
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,542
Oh! what happened?

540
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,417
Everyone knows about our relationship?

541
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,792
How can do such things in school?

542
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,292
You are the first student to do so.

543
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,875
Idiot, I'm talking about my relationship.

544
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,500
- What?
- She dumped me, uncle.

545
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:23,875
Go to her and beg
her to forgive you.

546
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,542
Will she forgive me?

547
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,125
When we can get a liquor if
we plead the bar tender.

548
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,250
she will accept your apology
if you plead.

549
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,542
She is yours.

550
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,583
Rotten bud.

551
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,833
- Hello. - What?
- I did all the mistakes.

552
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:51,167
I didn't mean it.

553
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,917
Uchcha promised to
keep it a secret.

554
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,375
Hang the phone, scoundrel.

555
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,833
- I'll die without you.
- Go to hell, moron.

556
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,333
Moron?

557
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,292
How dare you call me names?

558
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:12,125
Are you leaving the town, Ramya?

559
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,833
Are you dumping me?

560
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Get lost.

561
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:22,417
Return my sweet moments.

562
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,750
Return my intimate moments.

563
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,583
You act according to
the situation and as you wish.

564
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,833
Why do you cheat innocent guys?

565
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,708
Return my sweet moments.

566
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:47,500
She returned it.
- My girl gave it yesterday.

567
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,833
Ramya..

568
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:01,917
Angel..

569
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,125
What did you say?
- Angel.

570
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,167
Are you dumping for
this silly thing?

571
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,042
Is it silly?
Take your hands off me.

572
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,417
We spent hours together.
Is it fake?

573
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,667
That's not love but lust.

574
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,208
Attraction..
Infatuation..

575
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:21,417
You started it.

576
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,000
You are my life's happy moments.

577
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,750
Don't pretend.
Leave me.

578
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,917
This is it? You are leaving
me for ever? - Yes.

579
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:38,083
Perverted..

580
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,292
My love for you is
indeed permanent.

581
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,083
You rejected me.

582
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,042
Go away.

583
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,792
Some one will hug you.

584
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:48,042
He will move closely.

585
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:51,333
Don't lament about it later.

586
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:53,250
- Bye, Jeeva.
- We are leaving.

587
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,583
- Idiots..
- Convey it to your mom.

588
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:02,875
The curse of virgin
boys will haunt you.

589
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,917
- Hello.
- Hello.

590
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,458
Jeeva..

591
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,958
Who is this?
- It's me Aditi.

592
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:23,417
I wanted to tell you in person,
but I'm saying it now.

593
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,708
'I love you', Jeeva.
I love you so much.

594
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,708
- Jeeva.
- Ramya.

595
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,333
Go to hell.

596
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:31,875
I love you, Aditi.

597
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,833
- I love you.
- I love you too.

598
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,708
Ramya.. I got rid of that hitch.

599
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,667
When we lose a beautiful girl

600
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,833
we must believe that we will
meet even more beautiful girl.

601
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,208
Aditi entered into my life.

602
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,958
I started dreaming
about my married life.

603
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:08,458
Yes madam, its Perfenol 250 mg.

604
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,125
It's a heavy dosage.

605
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:12,042
Okay.

606
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,208
Dude, give me 3 condoms.

607
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,375
You still owe me a
credit for 17 condoms.

608
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:18,667
My dad is questioning me.

609
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,250
Will he question even
for such things?

610
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:24,917
Next time when you don't
have money, buy a balloon. - What?

611
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,500
- Who is she?
- You don't know her.

612
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,208
- I will get acquainted.
- She is from other department.

613
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,458
Tell me her name.

614
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,375
You will feel bad if I reveal it.

615
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:37,625
Go ahead.

616
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,708
Ramya.

617
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:42,583
Accounts department.

618
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,125
It's because of you she left me.
How can you?

619
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,375
Why are you still lamenting
about the past?

620
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:55,125
When her name strikes my
mind, I want to thrash you.

621
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:59,708
I just shared your achievement
with one of my friend.

622
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,125
I didn't expect him to spread the rumour?

623
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,875
When did I make love to her?

624
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,792
Just because Ramya left you,
Aditi came closer to you.

625
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,375
I have indeed helped you.

626
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,750
She is calling me up, dude.

627
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,750
I'll see you later.
Hello, I got it, Ramya.

628
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:23,125
Don't rush, Sandhya.

629
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,042
I have just reached the drug shop.

630
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:26,542
I'll definitely get it.

631
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,083
Mr. is it available?

632
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,750
- Which one?
- Which one?

633
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,208
Are you newly recruited?

634
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:33,917
Condoms..

635
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,792
Don't you have vanilla flavor?
- Vanilla.

636
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:53,000
Where is the chocolate flavor?

637
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,250
Don't you have butter scotch?

638
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,583
Am I running a ice cream parlor?

639
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:02,458
It's not available, oldie.
- Oldie?

640
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:05,542
Give me the money.
- Rs.120.

641
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,250
Just 120?

642
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:09,208
I heard that If I buy three Iíll
get the fourth one for free.

643
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:10,792
Not fair.

644
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:16,667
Sandhya, I'm done
with my shopping.

645
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:34,500
- Hello, Aditi, are you alone at home?
- Tell me.

646
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,042
- No one is at home.
- Are you sure?

647
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:38,375
Except granny.

648
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:40,792
Why don't you mention it first?

649
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,375
You didn't specify it.

650
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:44,958
Why is she screaming?

651
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,458
She is searching for medicine
and screaming meanwhile.

652
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,333
Hi, Jeeva.
Get in.

653
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,458
Take your seat.

654
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:08,583
I heard that some boys boozed and
troubled the neighbors.

655
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:09,708
Elaborate it.

656
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:12,125
- I'm unaware of it.
- Are you sure?

657
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:13,917
Is Aditi in?
- Aditi?

658
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:17,375
Jeeva has come, dear.

659
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,542
What's it, granny?
- Nothing.

660
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,292
- This one.. - Forget it.
It's time for the medication.

661
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:36,458
You always put me
under medication.

662
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,083
Listen to me.
- Granny..

663
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,375
...how long will you take rest
when you are under the medication?

664
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,792
1 or 2 minutes.That's all.

665
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,042
Why?

666
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:44,417
This is an imported medicine.

667
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:45,792
Very powerful.

668
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:47,500
You shouldn't open
your eyes for an hour.

669
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,208
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?

670
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,375
- It's burning.
- Granny..

671
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,417
...you must stay idle for an hour.

672
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:55,208
You mustn't open your eyes.
Else you may lose eyesight.

673
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:57,583
What do you mean?
Idiot.

674
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,958
Come let's move to the kitchen.

675
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,542
Where are you going?

676
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:05,125
- Granny.
- I'm feeling bored.

677
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,792
How will you manage her?

678
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,667
She has her eyes closed.

679
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:13,458
Something bit me.

680
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:18,292
What did you do?

681
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,833
It had been a long time
since I last met you.

682
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:24,458
- I missed you a lot.
- Very nice. - Yes.

683
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,708
Kiss me one more time.

684
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:10,333
Your kisses are very
delicious, my sweet sorcerer.

685
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:15,458
I'm enjoying this palpation.

686
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:20,833
Your kisses are very
delicious, my sweet sorcerer.

687
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:26,125
I'm enjoying this palpation.

688
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:29,208
You are tempting me, baby.

689
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:31,542
I have a crush on you, sweetie.

690
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:35,583
You make go crazy with your lips.

691
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:38,458
My mind has become a spoiled brat.

692
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:44,667
Your kisses are very
delicious, my sweet sorcerer.

693
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:49,958
I'm enjoying this palpation.

694
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:16,958
I'll turn my heart
into a aquarium tank.

695
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:22,167
Swim in it as a small fish.

696
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,625
My heart has broke the shackles
and has gone outrageous.

697
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:33,000
Your anklets creates
a panic in me.

698
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:37,417
My mind is after you.

699
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:43,250
Your kisses are very
delicious, my sweet sorcerer.

700
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:48,583
I'm enjoying this palpation.

701
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:18,042
Your smile makes me
to behave weirdly.

702
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:23,375
My mood swings to an excited state.

703
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:26,000
The liquor didn't get me high.

704
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,458
The supplementary
too didn't help.

705
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:34,083
I have spent sleepless
nights thinking of you.

706
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:37,417
I'm going bizarre.

707
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:40,708
Your kisses...

708
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,083
Lips..

709
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,167
Melting..

710
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,792
On cloud nine..

711
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:55,375
Your kisses are very
delicious, my sweet sorcerer.

712
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,208
I'm enjoying this palpation.

713
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,000
Tell me, Aditi.

714
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:13,167
Jeeva.

715
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,208
Why are you crying?

716
00:51:15,292 --> 00:51:17,375
Come to Deepa beach
house at the earliest.

717
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:18,667
Deepa beach house?
- Yes.

718
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,750
Upper crust morons.

719
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,000
Is it the way to dress up?

720
00:51:31,042 --> 00:51:32,042
Why are you crying?

721
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,250
I was photographed
in an indecent way.

722
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,792
Who did?
- It's them.

723
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,500
It's fake.
- Why did you take her snaps?

724
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,583
- She was beautiful, so I took it.
- I took hers.

725
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,250
I took everyone's.

726
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:49,458
Give me the phone.

727
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Why do you want it?

728
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,958
Give me the phone.
- Get lost.

729
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,708
There are 10 important
things for a man.

730
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:10,792
If you learn the most important
one, you can reach heights.

731
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,083
Give me the phone.

732
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,208
Give me the phone.

733
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:38,625
What's the password?

734
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:39,542
Samantha.

735
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:43,542
Delete it.

736
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,167
They have taken 4 snaps, Jeeva.

737
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:46,167
Delete it.

738
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,708
Take it and leave the place.

739
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,167
Why do you go to such places?

740
00:52:56,292 --> 00:52:57,458
I was invited for
a birthday party.

741
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,708
I felt very bad.
- That's why I came here.

742
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,042
Bye, Jeeva.

743
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:02,792
Good night.

744
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:04,542
Jeeva.

745
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:07,500
Why didn't you see the photos?

746
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,250
Why should I see the photos?

747
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,708
I will see it in live.

748
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,083
My parents have gone out.

749
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:15,250
Are you sure?

750
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:16,792
But my granny is in.

751
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:19,708
Say that she is in.

752
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:23,250
She will suspect you,
if you come alone.

753
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:28,125
I have an idea.

754
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:31,750
We shall invite 5 boys and girls
from our the neighbourhood.

755
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,458
We shall create an illusion
that it's an group study.

756
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,208
Be ready.

757
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:38,583
Repeat it.

758
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:41,583
Be ready.

759
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:49,583
Hi, Jeeva.

760
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:52,833
Jeeva.

761
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:54,625
I love you.

762
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:58,125
Be ready.

763
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:05,250
Jeeva..

764
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,375
Leave me.

765
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:12,458
Jeeva.

766
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,708
What are you doing?

767
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,042
I have to prepare for exam.

768
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:20,542
To study or to booze?

769
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:23,042
I have to prepare, dad.

770
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:24,167
Prepare at home.

771
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,958
We have to prepare in a group.

772
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:28,125
Why are you crying?

773
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,333
Please, let me go..

774
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,083
You never worried about academics.

775
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:33,792
Please let me go once.

776
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:34,833
I'll be back very soon.

777
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,667
- What happened?
- Thank you, dad.

778
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:38,792
Idiot.

779
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,500
How long can I wait?
- Dude...

780
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:42,042
Have you got the liquor

781
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,125
It's your debut

782
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:44,458
this is what I could get.

783
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:46,292
What is this?

784
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,625
My granny prepared it.

785
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,583
Drumstick dessert.
It gives you stamina.

786
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,625
You are very affectionate on me.

787
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,875
You have got it prepared for me.

788
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,208
She misses my grandpa.

789
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,917
Who is next?

790
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,625
Is this what you do, when
your parents are away?

791
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,375
You too. Jeeva?

792
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Come inside.

793
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,750
Thank you very much.

794
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:40,125
Last 2 days were horrible.

795
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,083
This is my day.

796
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,208
I'll have a blast.

797
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:51,417
Granny is coming here. Atleast
act as if you are studying!

798
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,042
Where is the rest room, madam?

799
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:54,208
Rest room?

800
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,417
- It's over here.
- Okay.

801
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,625
I will have some water.

802
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,125
He bit me hard.

803
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:14,417
Have you worked on
those problems?

804
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,833
- Whose shirt is this?
- It's nothing to worry.

805
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:21,042
I'll talk to you later.

806
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,333
Hello, my son.

807
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:25,500
Send it fast.

808
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,083
Come to my room at
1 o' clock, baby.

809
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,583
I spoke to your dad.

810
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:47,583
He is coming tomorrow.

811
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,000
I'll be relieved from tomorrow.

812
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,042
- Dude.
- Yes.

813
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:20,250
As it's my first time,
I'm feeling tensed.

814
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:23,458
- So..?
- I'll practice it once.

815
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,750
Practice?

816
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:33,458
This is my debut.

817
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:35,625
I have no experience.

818
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:38,958
I'm scared.

819
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:42,500
Nothing to get scared.
Come closer.

820
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:48,167
I love you.

821
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:05,708
What are you doing to my doll?

822
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,250
Give it..

823
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,917
- Nothing.
- Won't you spare even a doll?

824
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:13,208
Insane.

825
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:57,500
Why is she lying here like this?

826
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,708
I have come well prepared.

827
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,708
Aditi..

828
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,417
Get up..

829
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:19,042
Sweetie..

830
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:21,083
Aditi.

831
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:23,458
Get up.

832
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:26,542
Why don't you wake up?

833
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,375
You invited me.

834
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,458
Get up, Aditi.

835
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:37,917
I guess you are my companion
for the whole life.

836
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,500
You did invite him?

837
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,375
Why didn't you wake up?

838
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,958
He is drunk.
I smelled it.

839
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:53,458
So?

840
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:58,083
Boys behave well only when
they are in a normal state.

841
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:01,708
Once drunk, they will
behave abnormally.

842
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:03,333
Don't you like that?

843
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,958
I'm scared of it.

844
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:06,542
So, I avoided it.

845
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:13,708
She made me suffer by sleeping
through the whole night.

846
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,667
I was hoping for a good debut.

847
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:19,167
I'm totally done with it.

848
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:22,875
If you can't do it now.
You can do it later.

849
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,750
- Is it?
- Yes.

850
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,708
Why are you crying, sir?

851
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:34,333
My girl friend's dad
insulted me very badly.

852
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,417
Teach me the most
offensive word.

853
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:37,583
I have to insult him.

854
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,125
!@#$%

855
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:40,208
Boss?

856
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:42,292
Call him !@#$%

857
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,708
That's the most offensive word.

858
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,208
Pass the phone to your dad.

859
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,542
You are a !@#$%

860
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,125
Superb..

861
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:04,125
Thanks.
You look like GV Prakash.

862
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:06,458
Greeting, sir.

863
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,458
Sorry for hitting you.

864
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,583
Don't say 'hit' but 'caught'.

865
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:15,417
It was your mistake.

866
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,083
- Why did you take indecent snaps?
- What?

867
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:18,542
Yes.

868
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,083
That was the point.

869
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:21,417
We are from a rural area.

870
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:23,167
We have never seen girls booze.

871
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,542
So, we took snaps.

872
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,208
What does he mean?

873
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:27,833
- Ignore him.
- Aditi doesn't booze.

874
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:32,208
- She did booze.
- He is irritating me.

875
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:32,667
He will get thrashed.

876
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:34,875
- Show him the snaps she forgot to delete.
- What is he talking about?

877
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:35,875
Aditi can't booze.

878
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:36,875
Take a look at it.

879
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:43,167
I don't need to lie.

880
01:01:43,292 --> 01:01:44,792
Lifestyle has changed.

881
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:46,625
Boys are preforming
well at academics.

882
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,458
Girls have started boozing.

883
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,250
Bye.

884
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,792
See you later.

885
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:00,375
Do you booze Aditi?

886
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:04,042
- What do you mean,Jeeva?
- Don't you get it?

887
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:05,417
Do you booze?

888
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,000
Yes.

889
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:13,250
Since when?

890
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:15,542
4 months.

891
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,542
Why didn't you share it with me?

892
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:23,208
Fearing that you won't allow,

893
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:26,083
When you know that I won't
allow, why did you booze?

894
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,125
You too booze.

895
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,833
Can women do what men do?

896
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,542
I will just lose my money if I get high.

897
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:39,458
Don't you know what will
you lose if you get high?

898
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:43,375
A real boy friend will not
allow her girl to booze.

899
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:47,333
Promise me.

900
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,750
Swear on love that
you won't booze.

901
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,042
I swear, Jeeva.

902
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:11,000
Henceforth I will not booze.

903
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:26,542
Aditi.

904
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I'm coming.

905
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,208
Aditi has chosen the wrong path.

906
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,000
I guess she is cheating me.

907
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,667
She is voiding me since I
asked her not to booze.

908
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,708
Why are you blabbering?

909
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:38,167
She is a good girl.

910
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:39,875
Something is fishy.

911
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,208
Happy birthday to Uncle!

912
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:45,375
Happy birthday to Uncle!

913
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:48,875
Thank you..

914
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:51,292
Why are you looking dejected?

915
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,500
Aditi boozes.

916
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,333
Just like me.

917
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:56,500
She has kept it as a secret.

918
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,000
This is very silly.

919
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:01,167
I can't accept a woman boozing.

920
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,375
You broke up with Ramya
for the same reason.

921
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,958
Don't annoy her.

922
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,500
She will dump you.
Okay.

923
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:09,792
I guess it will rain.

924
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:11,500
Shall we go the pub?

925
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:12,708
Pub?

926
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,292
I have never been there.

927
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:15,292
Money?

928
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,250
I'll spend.

929
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:20,917
We have to spend at least
on our birthday.

930
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,667
Come on, boys.
Let's enjoy.

931
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:26,333
You enjoy the most when
it's someone else's money.

932
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:30,500
- Happy birthday, uncle..
- Thank you..

933
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,458
My darling.

934
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,500
Isn't it a bit pungent?
Yes, it is.

935
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:39,500
We could have boozed at
 the regular place.

936
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:42,917
Why is this idiot calling up now?

937
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,625
Hello.
Yes.

938
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,083
Karuppu Kumar?
I expected it.

939
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,583
No problem.

940
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,500
I'll be there in 5 hours.

941
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:54,708
By road.

942
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,542
Manage.
Stop it.

943
01:04:57,417 --> 01:04:58,583
- Okay.
- What's it, uncle?

944
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:00,125
I can't speak English.

945
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:01,833
It's an emergency.

946
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:04,125
I have to immediately
leave for Kumbakonam.

947
01:05:04,292 --> 01:05:07,125
You take care of the party.

948
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:10,042
- Settle the bill with the money
you have. - Uncle?

949
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:13,625
Make sure that everyone is
safely reaching their house.

950
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:14,583
Okay, guys.

951
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,875
- Bye, guys.
- Uncle..

952
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,458
- Bye, uncle.
- I like you.

953
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,583
Be careful.

954
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:32,917
Jeeva.

955
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,750
Get up, dude.

956
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:38,292
Buy me a drink.

957
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:41,250
Where had you been for
the last 10 minutes?

958
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:43,833
I went to the other side.

959
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,750
There is a boozing bet.

960
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:47,250
- What do you mean?
- Yes.

961
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:49,125
- I want to see it.
- Get up.

962
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:50,333
Let's go watch it.

963
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,500
- Where?
- Get up.

964
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:53,750
Look at there.

965
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:56,375
Drink...

966
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:07,750
- What happened?
- It's my girl.

967
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:12,833
It's Aditi.

968
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,083
Why did you break the promise?

969
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:24,625
Let's go talk in private.

970
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Tell me now.

971
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,833
Tell me one reason to stop
boozing, I'll stop it.

972
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:33,875
My mom doesn't booze.

973
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,875
So do my sisters.

974
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:37,958
So, you mustn't.

975
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:42,000
Confirm about your
mother's nature with your dad.

976
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,042
You bloody.

977
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,083
Don't cross your limits.

978
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:48,958
When a man drinks

979
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:56,500
A woman should advise
him and mend his ways.

980
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,333
How will a family prosper
when both partners booze?

981
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:06,125
I can accept if my girl is seen in beach,
temple or in a theater.

982
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:14,667
How can I accept her spending
time in liquor shop and pub?

983
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:18,083
When I say 'don't booze'.
I mean it.

984
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,042
Who are you to control me?

985
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,250
Good.

986
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:27,500
I was sincerely in love with you for
3 years without expecting anything.

987
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,208
You are ought to do it.

988
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:30,917
What's the use?

989
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:33,792
- Have you ever took advantage
of it? - I didn't get you.

990
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,042
Have you been ever intimate?

991
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:36,625
No.

992
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:38,167
I did try the other day.

993
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:40,167
You slept.

994
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,708
I thought you don't like it.

995
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:43,917
You were drunk.

996
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,833
I don't mix up drink and love .

997
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:49,000
Who said that I don't like it?

998
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,708
Ramya dumped just because of it.

999
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:54,583
I was afraid that it
may repeat again.

1000
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:59,708
If you want to strengthen a
relationship, you need to be intimate.

1001
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:03,500
To put in simple words

1002
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,958
Love is lust and vice versa.

1003
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,500
Got it?

1004
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,500
I didn't know this shade of yours.

1005
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:15,625
I heard actor Vikram performed
well in the movie 'I'.

1006
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,000
You set a bench mark in acting.

1007
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,333
You oldie.

1008
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:23,625
Don't you have a family?

1009
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,167
Won't your husband worry about you?

1010
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,792
You are enjoying with someone else?

1011
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:28,833
- Idiot.
- You too.

1012
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,250
Dude, what's problem
when a girl boozes?

1013
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:32,500
Move aside.

1014
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,375
It's not a thing to boast of.

1015
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:40,583
Men won't get physical
if they get high.

1016
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,292
but women aren't like men.

1017
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:45,958
Bro, what are you trying to prove?

1018
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,208
Now they want to booze.

1019
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,042
Then would like to get cozy.

1020
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,917
Will you agree to everything?

1021
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,083
Don't drag me into it.

1022
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,000
It's my mistake to love
such a cheap minded fellow.

1023
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:57,792
Bloody...

1024
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,417
Boys..

1025
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:01,500
Who is single?

1026
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,500
Note my number.

1027
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,208
99-44-0...

1028
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:07,667
44-44-0.

1029
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,583
Tonight,  ping me in whats app.

1030
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,417
I'll accept if I like your
approach, else I will block.

1031
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:15,542
Don't ping her.

1032
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,000
Delete her number.

1033
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,000
It's a three years bond.

1034
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,417
Ramya dumped me for
crossing the limits.

1035
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:27,417
She is dumping for not crossing it.

1036
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Get lost.

1037
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:49,833
Party party all night long

1038
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,792
Party party sing my song

1039
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:55,667
Party party play along because
I am your girl tonight.

1040
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,500
Come on come on let me see you moving..

1041
01:09:57,667 --> 01:09:59,542
Come on come on let me see you grooving...

1042
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:04,042
Come on come on let me see
you going crazy my baby..

1043
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,083
You cheated me like a con.

1044
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:26,458
I truly loved her to
become her life partner.

1045
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:29,875
She happily came
to see me gloomy.

1046
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:33,750
She wrecked my my happy
and healthy heart.

1047
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,500
She dressed up well.

1048
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,708
But she dumped as well.

1049
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I got cheated by her.

1050
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:48,583
So I'm gonna get high.

1051
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:53,333
One more time now, one more
time now, one more time baby.

1052
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:57,542
One more time now, one more
time now, one more time baby.

1053
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:12,625
You deceived with your words.

1054
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:16,375
I'm no dog to obey your command.

1055
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:20,208
I will booze and get high.

1056
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:24,417
You will be thrashed to
death if you encounter me.

1057
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,458
Let me wanna take you home.

1058
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,917
I was behind without
knowing that...

1059
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,583
...you are a con.

1060
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:43,250
You dumped in half the way

1061
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:47,500
I curse you to get sick.

1062
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,667
Come on come on.
Let me see you moving.

1063
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:59,625
Come on come on.
Let me see you grooving.

1064
01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:03,333
Come on come on.
Let me see you going crazy, my baby.

1065
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:05,333
Come on come on
let me hear you thump it.

1066
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:07,333
Come on come on
let me hear you jump it.

1067
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:11,125
Come on come on like a noise
about it. Yeh my baby.

1068
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:12,917
She dressed up well.

1069
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,875
But she dumped as well.

1070
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,708
I got cheated by her.

1071
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,667
So I'm gonna get high.

1072
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:29,167
You cheated me like a con.

1073
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:32,333
I truly loved her to
become her life partner.

1074
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:35,500
She happily came
to see me gloomy.

1075
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,292
She wrecked my my happy
and healthy heart.

1076
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:42,042
One more time..

1077
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,583
One more time...
Come on..

1078
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:48,667
One more time...

1079
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:52,042
One more time...
Come on..

1080
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:03,250
Are guys facing such
problems from modern girls?

1081
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,167
Why are you leaving for Kumbakonam?

1082
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:11,708
I spent all my money in Chennai.

1083
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:15,000
My uncle owns a bar here.

1084
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:18,042
I'll booze there 24/7.

1085
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,958
You will prosper in life.

1086
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,833
We have reached Kumbakonam.
Get down.

1087
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,542
- Jeeva!
- Why did you come here?

1088
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:31,792
I was coming to our home.

1089
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:34,958
You always have the
habit of coming here.

1090
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,208
Your dad is screwing me.

1091
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,792
I have booked the return ticket.

1092
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:42,083
The same train departs
in 30 minutes.

1093
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,042
- Please leave.
- Uncle.

1094
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,875
2 girls have dumped me.

1095
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:46,750
If I see them again

1096
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:47,875
I'll kill them.

1097
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:52,083
You are used to it
since childhood.

1098
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,208
You fall in love with a girl...

1099
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:55,750
... and someone will
get closer to her.

1100
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,625
If a girl dumps you
follow another.

1101
01:13:58,750 --> 01:13:59,417
No.

1102
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:01,333
Henceforth..
No girls. No Chennai.

1103
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,667
I'll booze in your bar
and will stay with you.

1104
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,750
In my bar?

1105
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:08,917
I have advised you a lot
since you were a kid.

1106
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,417
- You.. - Uncle, it's Ramya.

1107
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,833
- They got transferred from Chennai.
- Why is she here?

1108
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,292
You mustn't see her.

1109
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:21,417
No, jeeva.
No..

1110
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It won't work out.

1111
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:26,000
I'm going to make to
fall in love with me.

1112
01:14:28,292 --> 01:14:30,417
I'm gone.

1113
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:32,500
Here I come.

1114
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,417
Why did you come to Kumbakonam?

1115
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:54,792
Aditi and I broke up

1116
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,333
She says that she
only likes to drink

1117
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,792
I spent all my money
drinking in Chennai

1118
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:03,458
That's why I came here
to drink in your bar

1119
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:04,583
Fool...

1120
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,208
She drinks...

1121
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:09,833
She would be willing to spend money
and you have no objection over it

1122
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,500
Then why did you come
here to take my life?

1123
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:14,542
This will not work...

1124
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,458
If you are going to talk like this,
nothing is going to work out for you

1125
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,167
But something good happened here

1126
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:19,792
What is it?

1127
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,500
God shows a girl to us only once

1128
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:23,167
Yes...

1129
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:24,917
But I had a chance to see
Ramya the second time

1130
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:26,917
Yeah I saw that disaster
happen in the station!

1131
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:28,333
Henceforth, she is my life.

1132
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,708
Dog barks...

1133
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,042
And man loves...

1134
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:36,708
Do any one of these...

1135
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:40,292
Okay...

1136
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:41,583
Why are we drinking here?

1137
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,292
Let's go to your bar

1138
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:45,333
Bar...

1139
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,000
Has gone away from my hands

1140
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,333
What are you saying?

1141
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,125
- Just for one beer...
- I will say that...

1142
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,833
Sit down. Listen to me

1143
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,458
I will tell you everything

1144
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:57,208
In bar...

1145
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:59,458
On Sunday, a lot of
people came to relax

1146
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:02,083
Kumar...

1147
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:04,042
Made a corpse to sit

1148
01:16:04,417 --> 01:16:06,333
Accusing that he passed away

1149
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:09,708
Only after drinking in our bar

1150
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:12,875
They canceled even the
license of our bar

1151
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,917
This is the story.

1152
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:18,042
This bar set up...

1153
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,833
I was drinking alone

1154
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:25,417
Now that you have come here,
I am even more stressed out

1155
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:27,083
Forget it. You will
get your bar back

1156
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,875
I wonder where is
he going to take me

1157
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,417
Hara Hara Mahadevaki...

1158
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,542
Lazy goose...

1159
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:42,917
Why are you standing and sleeping
in the middle of the road?

1160
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,625
Come. Milk might get over

1161
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:45,958
Why are you taking me along?

1162
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:49,250
There is a psycho
roaming around here

1163
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:55,083
He throws bricks at every one

1164
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:05,333
Do you see a mark on my face?
It's because of him

1165
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:08,542
That's why I am taking you
along as my bodyguard

1166
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,167
How can I be your bodyguard?

1167
01:17:12,167 --> 01:17:13,167
That creature...

1168
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,750
Hits only localities

1169
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:16,708
He doesn't hit outsiders. Come.

1170
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:19,083
He is coming....

1171
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:23,792
He is that psycho...Run...

1172
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:29,583
Uncle...

1173
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,875
Didn't I tell you...?

1174
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,958
He finds localities

1175
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,167
And hits...

1176
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,417
That's sad...Is it paining?

1177
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:43,083
- I am taking this.
- Please take it

1178
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:43,917
Hold this...

1179
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,958
How much did it cost for
yesterday's and today's?

1180
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,250
Sixty-six rupees

1181
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:50,250
You add water

1182
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:51,875
And increase the price as well

1183
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:11,250
Why did you squeeze it?

1184
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,917
It's a feeling
after seeing Ramya

1185
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,917
Such an irresponsible fellow...

1186
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:21,208
If you do this again,
I will make you repent for it

1187
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,542
What did I do?

1188
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:25,750
She made me do it

1189
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:28,792
We will have to go to
Ramya's house to get milk

1190
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:45,792
Jeeva...

1191
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:47,417
Don't you squeeze...

1192
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:49,833
Don't you squeeze..

1193
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:48,542
Ramya...

1194
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,125
Ramya...

1195
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:57,250
Don't tell me you came to
Kumbakonam to see me, Jeeva

1196
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:03,333
Are you still angry on me for
what happened in our childhood?

1197
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:06,000
Look...

1198
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,333
I have so much
hatred towards guys

1199
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:10,083
- Move
- Why?

1200
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:13,292
I broke up yesterday

1201
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:20,667
I broke up with my girl yesterday
and you broke up with your guy too

1202
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:23,000
Shall we become friends?

1203
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:24,708
Shall I tell you something?

1204
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:27,042
We might have watched a
horror movie by mistake

1205
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:29,792
We might have decided
not to watch it again

1206
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:33,042
You are the most disgusting
horror movie in my life

1207
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,042
I will never see you again

1208
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:35,833
Goodbye

1209
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,583
Are you calling me
a horror movie?

1210
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,083
You are a porn movie....

1211
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:49,375
I am falling head over
heels in love with you...

1212
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:51,125
When in love...

1213
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:53,625
Don't behave like this...

1214
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,667
Do behave like this...

1215
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:58,625
If he had obeyed whatever she had
said, this wouldn't have happened

1216
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:48,333
You get me excited with
your glamorous dress.

1217
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:52,375
I lose myself in your eyes.
Why don't you embrace me?

1218
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:55,000
Why do you taunt me?

1219
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:59,708
Bruising my heart is unfair.

1220
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:03,000
Please fill the vacuum.

1221
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:06,292
I'm your abhorrence.
You are my ecstasy.

1222
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,333
You are ecstasy.

1223
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:09,750
You are ecstasy.

1224
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:10,917
You are ecstasy.

1225
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:12,167
You are ecstasy.

1226
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:13,667
You are ecstasy.

1227
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,125
You are ecstasy.

1228
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,500
You are ecstasy.

1229
01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:37,458
She rides me with in
pillion, hugging me.

1230
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:40,333
And leans on me.

1231
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,250
She has extreme mood swing.

1232
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,708
Good chat ends up badly.

1233
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:48,542
I'm puzzled by her behavior.

1234
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:51,208
Either she sobs or cons.

1235
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,000
Beware of this ache.

1236
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:57,042
You will be cornered.

1237
01:22:57,333 --> 01:23:00,042
She make you melt in her words.

1238
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:03,333
She has extreme mood swing.

1239
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,500
You are my ecstasy.

1240
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:05,875
You are my ecstasy.

1241
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,250
You are my ecstasy.

1242
01:23:07,542 --> 01:23:08,542
You are my ecstasy.

1243
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:10,208
You are my ecstasy.

1244
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:11,458
You are my ecstasy.

1245
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:12,917
You are my ecstasy.

1246
01:23:14,292 --> 01:23:17,000
Your love is a history.

1247
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:19,708
Your bondage is broken.

1248
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:22,583
You lost money for lust.

1249
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:25,500
Embarrassment is
all that you have.

1250
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:39,667
Why did you forget our moments?

1251
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:42,417
You broke up though
I was sincere.

1252
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,375
I'm still the same lover.

1253
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:47,875
I still have the same emotions.

1254
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,708
I'm cursing you as a virgin.

1255
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:53,708
You will get married to a rogue.

1256
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:56,667
My love is gone.

1257
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:59,500
You defeated a wild tiger.

1258
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:02,125
Get lost from my heart.

1259
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:05,458
I will find another girl.

1260
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:06,917
You are my ecstasy.

1261
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,292
You are my ecstasy.

1262
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,792
You are my ecstasy.

1263
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:12,708
You are my ecstasy.

1264
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:14,042
You are my ecstasy.

1265
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:17,542
You are my ecstasy.

1266
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,250
Seems like you are the
first customer for today

1267
01:24:46,292 --> 01:24:48,000
Math was tough when
I was at school

1268
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:51,000
Now girls seem to be tough

1269
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,042
Come here...

1270
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,417
You might have worked
out calculation

1271
01:24:58,417 --> 01:24:59,708
Yet, you might have
not understood

1272
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:01,333
When you go for tuition,
you will get it

1273
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:02,833
But girls aren't like that

1274
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:05,625
They have some other
calculation in mind

1275
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:06,750
It will come naturally

1276
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It will take time

1277
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:09,167
Enjoy...

1278
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:10,667
Eat this curry...

1279
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:15,333
You cook so well

1280
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,500
Why don't you open a
fast food restaurant

1281
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,917
I will not open any
shop except wine shop

1282
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,250
I will slap you

1283
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,500
Whatever...

1284
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:28,042
Did you try any way
to get back your bar?

1285
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,125
Oh God...

1286
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,333
This guy is embarrassing me
asking too many questions

1287
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:39,583
Please give back my wine shop
or I will be put to shame

1288
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:43,542
Do you know any one
who sells pirated movie CD?

1289
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:48,667
You will find CD Ragunanthan in my phone's
contact list. Call up to that number

1290
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:01,375
Do you have any pirated movie CD?

1291
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,375
I don't sell pirated...

1292
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,542
I sell porn movies

1293
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,167
Okay...

1294
01:26:08,458 --> 01:26:11,292
Do you know anyone here who
sell pirated movie CD?

1295
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,958
What's the deal?

1296
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:15,042
I will tell you...

1297
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:19,375
Why is she here?

1298
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:24,625
Whatever she asks, tell her you
don't have it. Let me hide in here

1299
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:30,708
Do you have any Gothic song CD?

1300
01:26:32,417 --> 01:26:33,667
What about sad songs?

1301
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:35,583
What do you have?

1302
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:38,333
Midnight...

1303
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:39,958
Aunt's age...

1304
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,583
A big heart...

1305
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:44,208
Cool breeze...
Close the window..

1306
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:47,375
Bursting crackers...

1307
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,833
Do you need any of these?

1308
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:50,958
Stupid...

1309
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:55,792
I asked her what she wanted....

1310
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:59,208
- Let's go. We will have to buy pirated movie CD
- Let's buy

1311
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,833
Guys can live however they want

1312
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:09,042
But girls have to live with fear

1313
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:12,667
Because, if guys get spoiled
it's more like a wet cloth

1314
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,417
They will be all right very soon

1315
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:16,583
You may not know when
they get spoiled

1316
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:17,875
And when they are all right

1317
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,167
But if girls get spoiled

1318
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:20,667
It's like a torn cloth

1319
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,042
Even if you stitch it

1320
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:25,292
It's quite visible

1321
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:57,750
I am an outsider...Don't hit me

1322
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,708
Have you arranged
a goon to hit me?

1323
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:02,833
This is our old shop

1324
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:05,708
But I have stopped entering now

1325
01:28:06,417 --> 01:28:09,292
They get high and mock me

1326
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:12,125
Listen to me. I cannot
enter the place

1327
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:14,875
- I was once an owner of this shop
- Come inside

1328
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:19,708
Look at his face...

1329
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,667
Look...These guys
are yelling at me

1330
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,125
Don't you hit...

1331
01:28:24,917 --> 01:28:26,500
Now you know why I
don't come here

1332
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:27,667
How embarrassing...

1333
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Wait for two minutes...

1334
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,083
What are you going to
do in two minutes?

1335
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:43,958
Count 1...2...3

1336
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:46,125
3...2...1

1337
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:52,667
- Police has come. Let's go
- Sit down

1338
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,250
Superb!

1339
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,875
Raid...

1340
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
- Hello, sir
- Who are you?

1341
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,625
I am Kumar from kumbakonam

1342
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:06,708
I am the owner of this bar

1343
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:07,458
So...?

1344
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,042
Why are you raiding this place?

1345
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:11,292
I am so pissed off. Don't
you speak a word. Go

1346
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,167
Come...Did you get something?

1347
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:14,625
- Show it to me...
- What's this?

1348
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:20,208
You have got license for the bar, right?
Why are you having pirated CD?

1349
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,917
I know nothing about this. I have
got nothing to do with this

1350
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:23,917
This bar is yours, right?

1351
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:24,583
Yes...

1352
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:25,667
Come...Walk to the station...

1353
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:26,458
Come...

1354
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,375
Please take this...My business
is running pretty good

1355
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:31,542
Here is the money for
our friendship...

1356
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,208
These are pirated CD...

1357
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:35,875
Don't you know that I am
actor Vishal's relative?

1358
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,333
- I know very well
- You know, right?

1359
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:40,042
Then why are you bribing me?
Walk to the station

1360
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:45,125
They have arrested Kumar...

1361
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:48,375
Who do you think will be
the owner of this bar?

1362
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:58,000
Visu....

1363
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,500
Jeeva...How do you feel if you get
a bottle of drink for free now?

1364
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,708
I will feel happy

1365
01:30:10,792 --> 01:30:12,125
How about ten?

1366
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:13,917
I will feel extremely happy

1367
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,542
How about thousand at a time?

1368
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Jolly....

1369
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:19,292
This my gift...

1370
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:23,417
I don't need your chain...

1371
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,750
You are happy that you
have got back your bar

1372
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:29,000
I am frustrated that I am
unable to get along with Ramya

1373
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:32,000
Stupid....Fool..Nonsense...Idiot

1374
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:38,042
I have got an idea

1375
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:43,542
Ramya has got an aunty
who looks like dinosaur

1376
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:44,458
Aunty?

1377
01:30:51,708 --> 01:30:55,000
If you have a good
relationship with her aunty...

1378
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,875
Ramya will be at your fingertips

1379
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:04,375
- Okay....
- Superb, Jeeva. All the best

1380
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:12,333
Hello, Simran

1381
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:14,000
Hello. Who are you?

1382
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,917
I will have to talk something
important about Ramya

1383
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:17,958
Ramya?

1384
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:24,125
What?

1385
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,708
Why are you giving a
wash to this cow?

1386
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:28,917
Only if you serve cows, Goddess Lakshmi's
presence will be there forever

1387
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:30,875
Why are you giving
a wash to my cow?

1388
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:33,083
- What about my cow?
- Your cow is feeding on grasses

1389
01:31:33,292 --> 01:31:34,458
What?

1390
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:36,208
- Yes. It's there
- Didn't I tell you earlier?

1391
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,292
That this is not ours

1392
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:42,917
Our cow's udder looks big.
This has got a smaller one

1393
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:44,208
What's udder?

1394
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,625
So..You are in
love with Ramya...

1395
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:50,167
I have heard a lot about
you through Ramya

1396
01:31:50,792 --> 01:31:51,792
Things that happened in School

1397
01:31:53,042 --> 01:31:53,708
Yes, Simran

1398
01:31:54,167 --> 01:31:54,958
That's great

1399
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:57,458
You are in love with the same
girl ever since childhood

1400
01:31:58,583 --> 01:31:59,583
First..I loved Ramya...

1401
01:32:00,042 --> 01:32:01,083
Then she left me

1402
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:02,458
I loved Aditi

1403
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:03,833
She left me, too

1404
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:06,417
Once again I met Ramya

1405
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:07,958
I was right...

1406
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:10,750
Guys are always restless

1407
01:32:11,917 --> 01:32:14,000
From now, Ramya is
everything to me

1408
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:17,625
Hindi speaking girl and
Tamil speaking girl...

1409
01:32:17,917 --> 01:32:19,625
They are of two
different flavours...

1410
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:21,917
Okay...How are they different?

1411
01:32:23,042 --> 01:32:24,875
Hindi girls don't take bath

1412
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,375
Tamil girls don't respect

1413
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:29,458
It looks like she speaks Hindi

1414
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:31,208
You know Ramya very well, right?

1415
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,042
Then why are you
asking me for help?

1416
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,208
These girls are....

1417
01:32:34,417 --> 01:32:35,417
Like Android applications

1418
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:37,542
They get updated too often

1419
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,708
Quite tough to download them

1420
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:42,167
Okay...

1421
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,583
I will help you...

1422
01:32:45,917 --> 01:32:47,083
But...a deal

1423
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:48,708
What is it?

1424
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:51,000
Take a look at the paper

1425
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:52,958
Paper?

1426
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:03,042
Look...

1427
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Run...

1428
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:18,042
Did you get caught
in a wine shop?

1429
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:19,125
Yes...

1430
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:21,042
Okay...What's the deal?

1431
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,083
If you want Ramya, I need beer

1432
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:24,667
What? Beer?

1433
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:26,708
Why are you asking for beer?

1434
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:30,708
How long will I act so good?

1435
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:34,917
What? Beer?

1436
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:40,375
If a girl is asking for
beer in Kumbakonam...

1437
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:42,708
She must be wicked

1438
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,583
That's why her husband
might have left

1439
01:33:46,042 --> 01:33:47,875
An alcohol addict

1440
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:49,667
Okay...

1441
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,500
You have got your
bar back, right?

1442
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,875
Why don't you send the beer?

1443
01:33:53,167 --> 01:33:55,292
I will send a load of beer

1444
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:57,375
Now you buy tickets
for Kathi movie

1445
01:33:58,083 --> 01:34:00,958
Once I decide, I
will never change it

1446
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:06,375
Move...My uncle is coming

1447
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:11,083
Jeeva...

1448
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:11,917
Tell me, Simran

1449
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:14,375
You have gone to batter
packing machine shop, right?

1450
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:16,708
No...The one next
to her house...

1451
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,708
- Batter machine, right?
- That's what I told you

1452
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:19,917
I am in the same place...

1453
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:23,375
Let's see if some magic happens here too.
All the Best

1454
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:31,417
Please grind it soon..

1455
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:36,917
Ramya...

1456
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:39,208
Ramya...

1457
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:41,208
Ramya...

1458
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:43,125
When we were in 10th grade

1459
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,625
In Chennai...Batter machine...

1460
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:45,708
- Velu...
- What is it?

1461
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,917
Please tell him, I will switch off
this machine if he doesn't get out

1462
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,000
- Please go
- Why are you embarrassing me?

1463
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:52,667
Switch off the machine...

1464
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:58,000
Why are you messing up with her?

1465
01:34:58,208 --> 01:35:00,542
Go...

1466
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:03,167
Why don't you go?

1467
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:04,125
Ramya...

1468
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:05,917
Get out...

1469
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:26,250
Ramya is humiliating
me so much, Simran

1470
01:35:26,792 --> 01:35:28,042
I don't know what to do

1471
01:35:28,833 --> 01:35:31,083
We might have heard so
many songs in our life

1472
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:33,333
But only when we listen
to a specific song...

1473
01:35:33,917 --> 01:35:36,250
We get back the same feeling

1474
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:38,208
Is there any song like that?

1475
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:41,917
Bring the moon to my bed!

1476
01:35:41,917 --> 01:35:43,750
You will never change, right?

1477
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:45,042
Here...Talk to her

1478
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,667
But she will cut the call
off if she hears my voice

1479
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:49,958
Why don't you try?

1480
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:53,250
For girls...It's only until
guys start talking...

1481
01:35:53,917 --> 01:35:54,917
When they talk...

1482
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:56,375
You can impress any girl.

1483
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:03,042
Pick up the call...

1484
01:36:06,667 --> 01:36:07,292
What happened?

1485
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:24,250
- What happened?
- She is not picking up the call

1486
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:25,917
Try calling her again

1487
01:36:29,292 --> 01:36:30,792
What's this, mom?

1488
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:33,333
Don't you buy even
for a precaution?

1489
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:35,417
My stomach is aching...

1490
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,167
My head is spinning

1491
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,292
Don't you know I have my period?

1492
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:42,125
You know to leave
me alone at home

1493
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:44,917
Simran...Please do me a favour

1494
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:23,208
You have knocked the door...

1495
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:24,750
You have almost
entered her heart

1496
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,875
Even if Arya comes

1497
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,500
He cannot stop it

1498
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:31,125
Why..Arya?

1499
01:37:31,917 --> 01:37:33,375
Arya does cycling...

1500
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:35,917
If he begins at 3 in the morning

1501
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:38,000
He rides continuously
to Mahabalipuram

1502
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:40,375
You have done which
no guy would do

1503
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,708
Only when guys get personal

1504
01:37:44,042 --> 01:37:45,542
Girls will start
having soft corner

1505
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:48,208
When she cried, I
couldn't stop myself

1506
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:49,583
I noticed it

1507
01:37:50,292 --> 01:37:51,667
I was wondering if it was acting

1508
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:53,458
But you were honest

1509
01:37:53,917 --> 01:37:55,042
One per cent of my tears

1510
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,625
And the rest is
what I have for...

1511
01:37:58,042 --> 01:37:59,583
I have sent her a message

1512
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:01,625
Let me see if she replies

1513
01:38:07,542 --> 01:38:08,542
- Ramya...
- Ramya?

1514
01:38:08,792 --> 01:38:10,333
Yes...Go...

1515
01:38:12,417 --> 01:38:13,250
Ramya...

1516
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,833
Did I disturb you?

1517
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:15,750
What is it?

1518
01:38:15,917 --> 01:38:17,542
You have come home
after a long time

1519
01:38:17,792 --> 01:38:18,458
No...

1520
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:20,208
I need to talk to you...

1521
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:22,208
- To me?
- I am confused

1522
01:38:22,917 --> 01:38:24,292
What happened?

1523
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:26,458
I told you about the guy I
loved at school, right?

1524
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:28,000
- Jeeva...
- Jeeva?

1525
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:31,417
Yeah....You have...

1526
01:38:31,667 --> 01:38:33,083
He passed away in
an accident, right?

1527
01:38:33,417 --> 01:38:34,417
No...

1528
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:35,333
Go...

1529
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:36,583
Go...

1530
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:38,333
He is in Kumbakonam now

1531
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,750
Kumbakonam? Why?

1532
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:42,542
I don't know...

1533
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,500
He came to my office...

1534
01:38:45,292 --> 01:38:46,708
Then he followed
me to the temple

1535
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:48,500
And batter machine...

1536
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:50,625
I slapped him

1537
01:38:51,042 --> 01:38:51,917
I made him cry

1538
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:54,042
Yet he is following me...

1539
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,458
He is reminding about my past...

1540
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:57,917
He came home yesterday...

1541
01:38:58,208 --> 01:39:00,167
I was suffering from
stomach ache yesterday...

1542
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:02,792
I wasn't able to reach
my mom and neither you

1543
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:05,458
He did what my mom does...

1544
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,708
That's when I decided
to throw my ego

1545
01:39:11,708 --> 01:39:14,417
In life, everybody gives
different feelings...

1546
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:18,542
But when you get back the
old feeling, take it

1547
01:39:19,958 --> 01:39:21,833
I don't know if Jeeva
is good or bad...

1548
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:24,583
But both of you have
loved each other

1549
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:26,875
Don't you be too friendly

1550
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:28,917
Maintain distance...

1551
01:39:30,417 --> 01:39:31,833
You are already broken up....

1552
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,292
Deal with him as
much as you can...

1553
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:36,542
Then break up...

1554
01:39:37,917 --> 01:39:40,542
- Then I will agree to his proposal
- Go ahead...

1555
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,000
What are you going to do?
She agreed, right?

1556
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:50,625
I don't know...

1557
01:39:51,417 --> 01:39:53,042
Girls like adventure...

1558
01:39:53,667 --> 01:39:54,875
Try something daring...

1559
01:39:55,167 --> 01:39:56,542
Please believe me, Ramya.

1560
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,000
Please don't hurt me.

1561
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:04,500
During school time, I was
in a different mindset!

1562
01:40:05,167 --> 01:40:08,167
We need not be like how we used to be.
But give me a chance.

1563
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:12,417
Thank you...Please come...

1564
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:17,750
Whose marriage is this?

1565
01:40:18,333 --> 01:40:19,750
Who know?

1566
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:30,500
Having feast at an uninvited marriage
is the only adventure I know!

1567
01:40:40,042 --> 01:40:41,625
Jeeva, let's go...

1568
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:43,583
Let's eat and go...

1569
01:40:57,333 --> 01:40:58,333
Wait...

1570
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:00,917
We are caught...

1571
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:03,917
You are going without this...

1572
01:41:08,292 --> 01:41:10,333
Ramya..I have got a
surprise for you...

1573
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:13,833
I will leave....

1574
01:41:16,417 --> 01:41:17,375
Where are you going?

1575
01:41:17,458 --> 01:41:18,042
Home...

1576
01:41:18,375 --> 01:41:19,750
I told you I have
got a surprise...

1577
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:21,292
Yes. What is it?

1578
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,625
Close your eyes...

1579
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:24,917
Close your eyes...

1580
01:41:34,417 --> 01:41:35,125
Open your eyes...

1581
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:38,542
Do you remember him?

1582
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:40,375
I have brought him
here from Chennai

1583
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:43,875
Please play it...

1584
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:49,167
Do you remember, Ramya?

1585
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:50,750
That day...

1586
01:41:50,917 --> 01:41:52,208
Do you remember how we were?

1587
01:41:52,208 --> 01:41:53,208
He knows it

1588
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:54,792
How we loved each other...

1589
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
That night...

1590
01:41:56,292 --> 01:41:57,292
I cannot forget it...

1591
01:41:57,542 --> 01:41:59,667
I wanted to remind you about
that night...That's why

1592
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:00,708
I got him here...

1593
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:02,583
Dear ones....

1594
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:04,625
Were you like that, that night?

1595
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:06,083
You were like this...

1596
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:21,167
Take care...

1597
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:22,250
He is a virgin...

1598
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:23,458
Bye...

1599
01:42:24,417 --> 01:42:25,417
It was beautiful, right?

1600
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:27,417
The times we spent
during school days..

1601
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:28,875
Yes, Ramya

1602
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:31,750
I feel like hugging you

1603
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,500
We are just friends...

1604
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:35,750
What? Friend?

1605
01:42:36,167 --> 01:42:37,583
I am treating you
as my friend...

1606
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,250
I cannot treat you that way...

1607
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:40,000
Why?

1608
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:40,958
Madness...

1609
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:43,542
When I close my eyes,
you are different

1610
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:46,500
We weren't like this...

1611
01:42:47,167 --> 01:42:48,500
I have forgotten all that...

1612
01:42:48,792 --> 01:42:49,917
I cannot forget it

1613
01:42:51,792 --> 01:42:53,333
Nobody will be there
at home tonight...

1614
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:56,208
You come.. Do
whatever you want...

1615
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:57,917
And leave from Kumbakonam...

1616
01:42:58,917 --> 01:42:59,500
What?

1617
01:42:59,917 --> 01:43:01,708
You don't need me. You
only need my body...

1618
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,250
You are hurting me...

1619
01:43:03,792 --> 01:43:05,000
Truth hurts. Isn’t it?

1620
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:07,375
If you talk like this...

1621
01:43:07,917 --> 01:43:09,000
I will go out of this place...

1622
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:09,667
Get lost...

1623
01:43:16,542 --> 01:43:17,542
The way she speaks...

1624
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,625
Only if I leave,
everything will be fine

1625
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:26,458
What a bad timing....

1626
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,500
I will join you for
the protest...

1627
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:38,375
Protest for?

1628
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:39,667
Don't you know?

1629
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,500
Kumbakonam is in chaos

1630
01:43:42,292 --> 01:43:44,250
Price of alcohol has
been increased...

1631
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:47,625
Everybody is protesting now...

1632
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:48,833
Wait for me...

1633
01:43:48,958 --> 01:43:51,042
Let me wear black..and join you

1634
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:52,500
I am going to Sabarimala

1635
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:53,667
What?

1636
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:56,292
I have decided to get rid of
drinks, girls and everything...

1637
01:43:57,292 --> 01:43:59,167
Love is like a sweet...

1638
01:43:59,708 --> 01:44:02,250
You should taste it slowly

1639
01:44:02,542 --> 01:44:05,000
Just like drinking alcohol, if
you have it in one round...

1640
01:44:05,333 --> 01:44:07,167
You might get high
and get overdosed

1641
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:09,958
But...the decision you
have taken now...

1642
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:11,458
It's good....

1643
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:14,917
Go...He is waiting for you on top of
the mountain. He will take care..

1644
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,042
Oh God....

1645
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:20,833
Jeeva...Wait...

1646
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:23,042
- Please wait
- Doesn't matter...

1647
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:26,292
Please listen to
me and then go...

1648
01:44:26,583 --> 01:44:27,125
What?

1649
01:44:28,333 --> 01:44:29,417
Where are you going?

1650
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:30,292
Sabarimala...

1651
01:44:34,667 --> 01:44:36,583
Will you restrain from
everything for 30 days?

1652
01:44:37,417 --> 01:44:38,000
Yes...

1653
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:40,667
Will you stay
without watching porn?

1654
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:44,667
Are you pulling my legs?

1655
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:47,625
I will show you something. You
might not leave after seeing it

1656
01:44:48,917 --> 01:44:49,917
What is it?

1657
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,167
Do you remember this?

1658
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,083
You still have it?

1659
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:13,458
Do you like me?

1660
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,167
Then why are you ignoring me?

1661
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:17,167
Obviously...

1662
01:45:17,792 --> 01:45:19,792
When I get closer, you
want to hug and kiss me..

1663
01:45:19,917 --> 01:45:22,167
If you talk about this all
the time, who would like it?

1664
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,542
Even you irritate me,
treating me as your friend

1665
01:45:25,667 --> 01:45:27,125
Okay. I will not treat
you like that.

1666
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,958
Okay. I will not
talk about that.

1667
01:45:30,792 --> 01:45:32,833
Look...We are not friends

1668
01:45:33,917 --> 01:45:35,083
And not lovers...

1669
01:45:36,458 --> 01:45:37,917
Love doesn't come spontaneously

1670
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:39,167
It will take some time

1671
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,667
If you wish to wait,
then it's fine

1672
01:45:42,042 --> 01:45:43,125
Else you may leave

1673
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:45,875
This is enough...

1674
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:47,917
This is enough...

1675
01:46:10,042 --> 01:46:11,625
You were about to leave for Sabarimala.

1676
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:13,917
You are here just
because she said so

1677
01:46:14,292 --> 01:46:17,125
Do you think it is that simple?

1678
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:19,625
I decided to go thinking
she wasn't there

1679
01:46:20,042 --> 01:46:21,042
But she is back now

1680
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:22,875
why should I go Sabarimala?

1681
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:24,500
I am extremely happy

1682
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,083
You have made a deal with
God and decided not to go

1683
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:31,000
- Forget it
- Superb!

1684
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:33,250
Uncle...My hands are itchy...

1685
01:46:33,708 --> 01:46:35,458
Do you think I am
going to get money?

1686
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:36,917
You will get leprosy...

1687
01:46:37,208 --> 01:46:38,500
Go wash your hands with a soap

1688
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:40,458
Here...Take it

1689
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:46,417
Look what are they doing

1690
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,458
Run, Bhaskar....Run...

1691
01:46:49,542 --> 01:46:50,542
Run...

1692
01:46:52,125 --> 01:46:54,667
I told you to do business,
not prostitution

1693
01:46:55,875 --> 01:46:58,167
Ramya seems to be slowly
entering in your life...

1694
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,625
I have been noticing...

1695
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:02,917
That I have been
giving bottles of beer

1696
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:04,292
And you are stocking
it in the fridge

1697
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:05,208
But not drinking it

1698
01:47:05,417 --> 01:47:07,167
If girls drink in front of guys

1699
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,958
Guys will take advantage of it

1700
01:47:09,583 --> 01:47:10,583
That's for girls

1701
01:47:10,917 --> 01:47:11,667
You are an aunty...

1702
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:13,333
You are going to
get hurt real bad

1703
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:14,458
Switch on the AC

1704
01:47:15,792 --> 01:47:16,500
Is this the one?

1705
01:47:25,375 --> 01:47:26,083
Why...?

1706
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:29,042
Are you staying alone
in this house?

1707
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
My uncle told me...

1708
01:47:31,792 --> 01:47:33,583
That you are estranged
from your husband

1709
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:34,250
Vikram...

1710
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:36,583
He is a scientist

1711
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:38,583
I am going back to Kolkata

1712
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:41,750
What are you going to do there?
Durga Puja?

1713
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:42,625
So what...?

1714
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,708
You have been resting
in the lab for a year

1715
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,208
Why don't you take up
a job as a professor?

1716
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:49,292
One thing you should
understand...

1717
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:51,458
You get curd in a day
by fermenting milk

1718
01:47:51,667 --> 01:47:52,500
Beer isn't like that

1719
01:47:52,542 --> 01:47:53,542
It takes time

1720
01:47:53,792 --> 01:47:55,000
I can't wait any more...

1721
01:47:55,542 --> 01:47:56,833
Whatever...

1722
01:47:57,333 --> 01:48:00,458
You have waited long enough...Why
don't you wait for some more time?

1723
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:01,375
Can't you wait?

1724
01:48:01,667 --> 01:48:03,667
Time is money, Vicki...

1725
01:48:03,708 --> 01:48:05,292
I don't have money...

1726
01:48:05,833 --> 01:48:06,917
But I have more time...

1727
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:07,958
For you

1728
01:48:08,708 --> 01:48:12,750
Do you think I can
pay all the bills?

1729
01:48:13,042 --> 01:48:14,625
People are discovering
various things...

1730
01:48:14,917 --> 01:48:18,083
But you are trying to discover
beer with a formula...

1731
01:48:18,375 --> 01:48:18,792
Don't you break it...

1732
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:21,042
You are useless and whatever
you do is going wasted...

1733
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:21,750
Mental...

1734
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:24,083
My formula has a value

1735
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:25,542
My life can change anytime...

1736
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:27,792
Look....That's a good timing...

1737
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:29,000
Hello, sir...

1738
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,958
Hope everything is fine...

1739
01:48:31,542 --> 01:48:32,083
What?

1740
01:48:32,917 --> 01:48:33,917
Everything is gone...?

1741
01:48:34,042 --> 01:48:35,875
No...Nobody can
steal my formula...

1742
01:48:36,792 --> 01:48:37,917
I can file a case against....

1743
01:48:37,917 --> 01:48:39,208
Hello...Hello...

1744
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:50,583
You...said useless...
I have become that

1745
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:54,250
I love you...

1746
01:48:54,917 --> 01:48:56,250
Therefore, I leave you...

1747
01:48:58,167 --> 01:48:58,833
Vikram...

1748
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,208
So...I am waiting for
him to come back

1749
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:06,250
Do you think he will?

1750
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,292
True love is like dandruff...

1751
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:10,083
You may feel like it has gone...

1752
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,250
But it stays forever...

1753
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:16,458
Simran....It's Ramya...

1754
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:18,167
Attend the call...

1755
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:22,167
Tell me Ramya...

1756
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:23,042
Jeeva...

1757
01:49:23,542 --> 01:49:24,917
What happened?
Why are you crying?

1758
01:49:24,917 --> 01:49:26,333
Problem at home....

1759
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:28,500
Home is always like that...

1760
01:49:28,792 --> 01:49:29,417
No...

1761
01:49:29,792 --> 01:49:31,625
Dad got drunk...

1762
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:34,292
My mom beat my father

1763
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:36,625
Why are you all beating him?

1764
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,542
Drunkards are like babies

1765
01:49:38,917 --> 01:49:40,708
Search for your dad's
childhood picture...

1766
01:49:41,125 --> 01:49:42,375
Childhood picture? Why?

1767
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:43,750
Search....

1768
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:47,208
Did you find?

1769
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:50,625
Are you still searching?

1770
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:54,208
Yeah. I have found it

1771
01:49:54,208 --> 01:49:55,708
Take that photo and go to him

1772
01:49:56,917 --> 01:49:58,708
Place the photo next
to your dad's face

1773
01:50:00,708 --> 01:50:01,708
Have you?

1774
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,417
Do both the faces look the same?

1775
01:50:03,542 --> 01:50:05,333
Yes. They look the same

1776
01:50:05,583 --> 01:50:07,917
I told you, right? Drunkards
are like babies...

1777
01:50:08,458 --> 01:50:09,458
Please understand this...

1778
01:50:20,417 --> 01:50:21,000
Ramya...

1779
01:50:21,458 --> 01:50:22,542
Tell me, Jeeva

1780
01:50:23,208 --> 01:50:25,625
I am standing out

1781
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:26,667
What?

1782
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:28,167
I cannot come...

1783
01:50:28,708 --> 01:50:30,375
The other day when you
called me, I came

1784
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:31,375
- Come
- Okay. I will come

1785
01:50:38,625 --> 01:50:41,125
Did you watch Titanic
in CTV today?

1786
01:50:41,833 --> 01:50:43,250
Did you come here
to ask me this?

1787
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:44,625
Tell me...

1788
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I watched...

1789
01:50:46,417 --> 01:50:47,500
A beautiful feeling, right?

1790
01:50:47,708 --> 01:50:50,875
Both the girl and the boy stand on edge
of the stern and extend their hands

1791
01:50:51,292 --> 01:50:52,292
It's beautiful movie

1792
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:53,833
Do you wish to do that?

1793
01:50:59,708 --> 01:51:02,875
Wind blows in the movie,
but there is no wind here

1794
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:05,833
Think of someone you like

1795
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:07,625
Definitely you
will feel the wind

1796
01:51:07,917 --> 01:51:08,917
Turn....

1797
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,500
Close your eyes...

1798
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:14,500
Oh God! Let the wind blow

1799
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:16,875
Extend your hands

1800
01:51:19,292 --> 01:51:20,292
Open your eyes

1801
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:27,417
You came up as my ecstasy.

1802
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:30,292
We shall lead a blissful life.

1803
01:51:30,375 --> 01:51:33,083
Banish the emotions.

1804
01:51:33,167 --> 01:51:36,708
Embrace me and honor
me like a queen.

1805
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:45,167
- Whom did you think of?
- I will tell you later

1806
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,375
Come on my sweetie!

1807
01:51:47,417 --> 01:51:50,208
Let's become inseparable.

1808
01:51:50,417 --> 01:51:52,833
You are my life partner.

1809
01:51:52,917 --> 01:51:56,292
I'll become your pet at your nod.

1810
01:51:56,333 --> 01:52:01,542
You are my sweetie!!

1811
01:52:01,708 --> 01:52:07,042
You came like deer to
fill up my vacant heart.

1812
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:12,625
God created you just
for me to envy.

1813
01:52:12,875 --> 01:52:15,417
Come on my sweetie!

1814
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:18,333
Let's become inseparable.

1815
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:21,125
You are my life partner.

1816
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:24,583
I'll become your pet at your nod.

1817
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:31,583
My cutie pie!!

1818
01:52:39,875 --> 01:52:41,125
- Uncle...
- What?

1819
01:52:41,417 --> 01:52:43,250
Ramya hugs...

1820
01:52:43,542 --> 01:52:44,417
Kisses...

1821
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:45,833
She allows me to do everything

1822
01:52:45,958 --> 01:52:47,167
Then...What's your problem?

1823
01:52:47,417 --> 01:52:48,833
But she doesn't propose...

1824
01:52:49,792 --> 01:52:51,417
That's where is the barrier...

1825
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:54,000
If you take it out

1826
01:52:54,417 --> 01:52:57,958
She will be open...

1827
01:52:58,083 --> 01:52:59,792
To propose

1828
01:52:59,875 --> 01:53:00,583
Really?

1829
01:53:00,625 --> 01:53:01,625
It will work out

1830
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:13,208
Is it taking you too
long to open the door?

1831
01:53:13,583 --> 01:53:14,208
Wait...

1832
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:15,250
Get out...

1833
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:16,458
Why?

1834
01:53:17,125 --> 01:53:18,500
Where were you all these days?

1835
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:20,250
Ignoring my calls...

1836
01:53:20,917 --> 01:53:21,708
Sorry, Simran

1837
01:53:21,958 --> 01:53:24,000
After a long time, Ramya and I
are now spending time together

1838
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,250
Time flies...

1839
01:53:26,125 --> 01:53:26,792
But...

1840
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:28,167
If girls don't like...

1841
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:29,667
They throw guys away

1842
01:53:29,875 --> 01:53:30,958
But once they like...

1843
01:53:31,458 --> 01:53:32,417
They embrace us

1844
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:36,167
Did you say anything
about me to Ramya?

1845
01:53:36,208 --> 01:53:37,625
No. I am waiting
for the right time

1846
01:53:37,667 --> 01:53:38,792
But when I get time I will

1847
01:53:39,375 --> 01:53:40,583
Don't....Say

1848
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,500
Why?

1849
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:44,875
Already I lost my dignity
going to the wine shop

1850
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:47,417
Ramya isn't talking
to me properly

1851
01:53:47,958 --> 01:53:49,958
If she gets to know that
I am roaming with you...

1852
01:53:50,542 --> 01:53:51,833
Disgusting....

1853
01:53:53,167 --> 01:53:53,750
Promise me...

1854
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:56,833
Promise me you will not
talk about me to Ramya...

1855
01:53:57,833 --> 01:53:59,583
Promise isn't like this...

1856
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:01,958
Promise me...

1857
01:54:02,208 --> 01:54:02,792
Okay...

1858
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:04,542
Promise...I will not tell her

1859
01:54:05,125 --> 01:54:05,917
Forget it....

1860
01:54:06,542 --> 01:54:08,167
I have got two tickets
for Ajith's movie

1861
01:54:08,333 --> 01:54:08,917
Shall we go?

1862
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:10,417
Mental.....

1863
01:54:10,917 --> 01:54:13,000
If I come with you,
everybody will know

1864
01:54:13,542 --> 01:54:14,542
I have an idea....

1865
01:54:15,083 --> 01:54:16,208
It's pretty an old style...

1866
01:54:16,542 --> 01:54:17,542
But effective...

1867
01:54:37,208 --> 01:54:39,333
- Superb
- It was awesome, right?

1868
01:54:42,208 --> 01:54:43,208
- What?
- Who?

1869
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:45,250
How do I know?

1870
01:54:50,042 --> 01:54:52,750
He has done just as I told him.
Finally the plan has got successful

1871
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:01,708
How is it? He is back...

1872
01:55:05,417 --> 01:55:07,917
I have collected
beer bottles for you

1873
01:55:08,625 --> 01:55:09,875
So that you could start
your experiment once again

1874
01:55:09,917 --> 01:55:11,333
You are being foolish like me...

1875
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:15,417
It's possible to copy from one movie to the
other..But it's not possible with beer...

1876
01:55:15,458 --> 01:55:16,458
I did not go to Kolkata

1877
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:17,958
I knew...

1878
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:19,833
I knew you wouldn't go any where

1879
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:21,750
I knew you would come back

1880
01:55:22,042 --> 01:55:23,042
Next week...

1881
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,958
The ones who stole my formula...

1882
01:55:25,167 --> 01:55:27,458
I am going to have
out-of-court-settlement with them

1883
01:55:28,042 --> 01:55:30,042
I thought of meeting
you after that

1884
01:55:30,167 --> 01:55:30,750
Before that...

1885
01:55:31,167 --> 01:55:32,333
Jeeva....

1886
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:33,917
Please listen to me. Come

1887
01:55:34,125 --> 01:55:35,000
Why should I listen to you?

1888
01:55:35,042 --> 01:55:36,375
Listen to me...Come...

1889
01:55:36,417 --> 01:55:37,167
Okay...I will come

1890
01:55:40,875 --> 01:55:42,250
Sir....One second...

1891
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:43,458
I am at uncle's house...

1892
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:44,625
Ramya is calling me...

1893
01:55:44,792 --> 01:55:47,042
- I will go. Bye...
- You should have done this earlier

1894
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:53,458
Ramya...You said you
wanted to meet me urgently

1895
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:55,250
Where did you go this evening?

1896
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:56,250
Movie...

1897
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:57,500
With whom?

1898
01:55:58,375 --> 01:55:58,917
Friend...

1899
01:55:59,333 --> 01:56:00,125
Who is it?

1900
01:56:00,417 --> 01:56:01,417
CD Ragu...

1901
01:56:02,333 --> 01:56:02,917
CD Ragu?

1902
01:56:03,417 --> 01:56:04,708
- Yes
- Is this CD Ragu?

1903
01:56:06,708 --> 01:56:08,708
Oh oh! She has caught
me going with Simran!

1904
01:56:10,792 --> 01:56:11,333
Who is this?

1905
01:56:13,458 --> 01:56:14,708
Tell me who is this?

1906
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:15,833
I will not do anything...

1907
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:17,083
Tell me, Jeeva

1908
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:19,708
Promise me that you will not
talk about me to Ramya...

1909
01:56:20,292 --> 01:56:21,667
Promise...I will not say

1910
01:56:26,833 --> 01:56:28,417
I was about to propose to you...

1911
01:56:29,542 --> 01:56:30,917
God has saved me from you

1912
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:32,167
The second time...

1913
01:56:34,375 --> 01:56:35,833
Nothing will work out between us

1914
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,292
I don't need you...

1915
01:56:39,167 --> 01:56:40,292
Ramya...

1916
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:41,500
Ramya...

1917
01:56:41,917 --> 01:56:42,417
Ramya...

1918
01:56:42,958 --> 01:56:44,375
- Ramya...Come
- Leave me

1919
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:46,500
Such a fraud you are...

1920
01:56:58,750 --> 01:56:59,625
Hello...

1921
01:57:00,708 --> 01:57:01,917
Jeeva...

1922
01:57:04,292 --> 01:57:04,958
Who is it?

1923
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:07,417
Aditi here...

1924
01:57:08,125 --> 01:57:11,375
I shouldn't have broken
up with you, Jeeva...

1925
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:13,958
It's my fault...

1926
01:57:14,125 --> 01:57:16,083
I did not understand you...

1927
01:57:16,417 --> 01:57:18,000
Jeeva....I love you

1928
01:57:19,292 --> 01:57:21,833
Do you think all
guys love for lust?

1929
01:57:22,583 --> 01:57:24,042
Some people have true love

1930
01:57:25,333 --> 01:57:26,417
I am in love with Ramya

1931
01:57:27,542 --> 01:57:28,250
Cut the call...

1932
01:57:30,667 --> 01:57:34,000
What about the promises you made?

1933
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:37,875
Did you burn away your
promises in flame?

1934
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,542
My love is passed
like a hang over.

1935
01:57:45,375 --> 01:57:48,792
Did you love me
to get me dumped?

1936
01:57:48,917 --> 01:57:52,708
You betrayed my trust.

1937
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,917
You slayed my sincere love.

1938
01:57:59,417 --> 01:58:03,625
Why did you stay close to me?

1939
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:07,583
I hated my love because of you.

1940
01:58:07,958 --> 01:58:15,417
Did you go away to get
rid off the heavy love?

1941
01:58:22,292 --> 01:58:25,750
You disappeared all of a sudden.

1942
01:58:25,917 --> 01:58:29,458
I am crestfallen without you.

1943
01:58:29,625 --> 01:58:35,667
Life without you is a hell.

1944
01:58:51,292 --> 01:58:52,583
Run.....

1945
01:59:06,042 --> 01:59:10,333
Even though I change my dress,
he finds out and throws at me

1946
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:13,125
Psycho...

1947
01:59:13,375 --> 01:59:15,542
I wonder who gave birth to you

1948
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,250
Come...Good time

1949
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:25,917
What? Having fun, is it?

1950
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:28,292
It's been so long, right?
That's why

1951
01:59:32,042 --> 01:59:33,167
What happened to Ramya?

1952
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:34,625
I saw her last at
the bus stop...

1953
01:59:35,375 --> 01:59:37,000
It's been four days
since I spoke to her

1954
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,333
I am missing her, Simran

1955
01:59:40,458 --> 01:59:42,250
Imagine that you are
talking to Ramya...

1956
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,750
Whatever you have been wanting
to talk to her, tell me

1957
01:59:46,167 --> 01:59:46,667
How?

1958
01:59:47,667 --> 01:59:48,667
Did this in Vaali movie

1959
01:59:48,917 --> 01:59:49,917
I am trying it for you...

1960
01:59:54,083 --> 01:59:54,583
Pick up...

1961
01:59:56,542 --> 01:59:57,333
Hello..Tell me...

1962
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:58,500
What?

1963
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:00,333
Ramya...

1964
02:00:01,042 --> 02:00:01,750
Okay...Tell me

1965
02:00:02,667 --> 02:00:04,667
Ramya....I love you so much

1966
02:00:05,458 --> 02:00:07,375
It was your aunt Simran...

1967
02:00:08,083 --> 02:00:09,125
What? My aunt?

1968
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:10,167
Yes...

1969
02:00:10,458 --> 02:00:12,417
Then...why didn't you
tell me when I asked you

1970
02:00:12,458 --> 02:00:14,458
She promised me not to tell you

1971
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:16,208
Fool...

1972
02:00:16,417 --> 02:00:18,417
Is the promise that important?

1973
02:00:18,458 --> 02:00:19,458
Isn't like that...

1974
02:00:19,875 --> 02:00:22,833
Simran helped me a lot...

1975
02:00:24,042 --> 02:00:26,292
I like her as much as I like you

1976
02:00:30,708 --> 02:00:31,708
Sorry, Jeeva

1977
02:00:33,292 --> 02:00:35,500
You both don't have to be
separated because of me

1978
02:00:36,167 --> 02:00:37,667
I miss her a lot, Simran

1979
02:00:39,708 --> 02:00:40,458
Ramya...

1980
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,333
Were you feeling bad for this?

1981
02:00:59,417 --> 02:01:00,417
Life is a circle

1982
02:01:01,583 --> 02:01:04,583
The one who loves, will break up and
the one who breaks up, will love.

1983
02:01:08,417 --> 02:01:09,583
Coming...

1984
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:13,542
Was it you who re-united them?

1985
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:15,792
Yes...

1986
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:17,083
Did you buy beer for my aunt?

1987
02:01:19,417 --> 02:01:20,167
Yes...

1988
02:01:21,083 --> 02:01:21,875
Thanks, Jeeva...

1989
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,708
To bring my uncle here...

1990
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:24,958
Ramya...

1991
02:01:25,333 --> 02:01:27,292
We end up fighting
all the time...

1992
02:01:27,333 --> 02:01:29,125
We have so much of ego...

1993
02:01:29,417 --> 02:01:31,125
You know nothing about my past

1994
02:01:31,417 --> 02:01:33,292
So do I know nothing about you

1995
02:01:33,542 --> 02:01:34,875
Let's talk for five minutes...

1996
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:36,542
- Okay?
- Okay...

1997
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,708
I will ask you five questions...
Let's get it cleared...

1998
02:01:43,417 --> 02:01:44,583
Do you smoke?

1999
02:01:46,375 --> 02:01:48,000
Good girl...

2000
02:01:50,333 --> 02:01:52,292
Do you drink?

2001
02:01:53,292 --> 02:01:54,208
God....

2002
02:01:54,958 --> 02:01:55,708
Thank you...

2003
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:01,583
I drink a lot but if you
tell me to stop, I will

2004
02:02:03,417 --> 02:02:04,208
Third question...

2005
02:02:05,458 --> 02:02:09,250
Have you loved anyone before?

2006
02:02:09,417 --> 02:02:10,250
You?

2007
02:02:10,958 --> 02:02:12,125
After you, it was Aditi...

2008
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:13,500
That's all...

2009
02:02:15,042 --> 02:02:15,625
You....?

2010
02:02:16,958 --> 02:02:19,208
After you, I loved
someone else...

2011
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:21,958
You know it already.Stop
over reacting!

2012
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,958
Okay...Got compensated...

2013
02:02:27,667 --> 02:02:30,958
Have you kissed him?

2014
02:02:31,667 --> 02:02:32,333
You?

2015
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:34,083
Just once on the lips.

2016
02:02:36,042 --> 02:02:36,750
You?

2017
02:02:37,125 --> 02:02:38,458
Whenever I meet him...

2018
02:02:40,208 --> 02:02:42,500
My heart is paining...
I can't take it...

2019
02:02:43,458 --> 02:02:44,458
Last question...

2020
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,375
You and him...

2021
02:02:48,583 --> 02:02:50,458
Did you make love with him?

2022
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:58,458
Don't cry...

2023
02:02:59,417 --> 02:03:01,083
Sorry...Sorry...

2024
02:03:01,417 --> 02:03:03,125
You guys don't spare that...

2025
02:03:04,917 --> 02:03:06,000
You are leaving me, right?

2026
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,208
Go...

2027
02:03:08,542 --> 02:03:09,542
You will get a guy...

2028
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:19,833
Curses from guys will become true

2029
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:22,833
Why are you crying?

2030
02:03:23,667 --> 02:03:24,625
I will kill you...

2031
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:26,375
I told you because
you asked me...

2032
02:03:26,792 --> 02:03:28,208
So...Will you say all these?
You shouldn't...

2033
02:03:28,208 --> 02:03:30,333
Why are you making a big
deal out of a small thing?

2034
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:31,375
Is this a small thing?

2035
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:34,125
I will call Harish.
Let him come...

2036
02:03:34,750 --> 02:03:35,292
Call him...

2037
02:03:35,333 --> 02:03:38,208
Let him come. I will
murder you both

2038
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:40,458
Hello, Harish. Come
to my aunt's place

2039
02:03:42,333 --> 02:03:44,417
Jeeva and I are having
problems because of you...

2040
02:03:44,833 --> 02:03:45,833
You have to reunite us.

2041
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:04,417
Hi...Dear....

2042
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:10,708
You said it was something
important...

2043
02:04:12,042 --> 02:04:14,250
You look so beautiful

2044
02:04:14,458 --> 02:04:15,917
What's happening here?

2045
02:04:16,833 --> 02:04:17,542
Who is he?

2046
02:04:18,333 --> 02:04:20,625
- He is saying it's all because of you
- What problem?

2047
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:22,542
The other day...at your home...

2048
02:04:22,708 --> 02:04:24,208
Is that all? One minute...

2049
02:04:29,958 --> 02:04:30,667
Boss...

2050
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:31,375
What?

2051
02:04:31,417 --> 02:04:32,417
I did it just once...

2052
02:04:33,208 --> 02:04:34,958
What? What are you saying?

2053
02:04:35,958 --> 02:04:36,958
Just once...

2054
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:38,750
Just once...

2055
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:42,375
Jeeva...He is saying we did it just
once...Then what's the big deal?

2056
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:44,708
I will kill you...

2057
02:04:46,542 --> 02:04:48,000
Haven't you done at all?

2058
02:04:48,583 --> 02:04:49,458
No...

2059
02:04:50,417 --> 02:04:51,417
You have missed it...

2060
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:53,500
Why?

2061
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:00,417
Lot of people might
have sacrificed...

2062
02:05:01,042 --> 02:05:02,833
I cannot be like that...

2063
02:05:03,542 --> 02:05:04,542
Once...?

2064
02:05:04,792 --> 02:05:05,792
Once...?

2065
02:05:07,708 --> 02:05:09,042
How many times will he
say the same thing?

2066
02:05:09,083 --> 02:05:11,167
I confessed...But why
are you leaving?

2067
02:05:11,542 --> 02:05:14,125
Curse from a virgin
guy will come true...

2068
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,500
Why is he getting angry?

2069
02:05:17,917 --> 02:05:19,417
Okay...You sit down...

2070
02:05:20,792 --> 02:05:22,167
We broke up
unnecessarily, right?

2071
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:22,958
Yes...

2072
02:05:23,083 --> 02:05:25,042
- What happened?
- We are just talking...

2073
02:05:25,625 --> 02:05:26,625
Jeeva...

2074
02:05:27,583 --> 02:05:28,583
Jeeva...

2075
02:05:29,042 --> 02:05:30,542
What do you want?

2076
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,708
Do you think you can
do whatever you want?

2077
02:05:33,792 --> 02:05:35,208
I don't need girls...

2078
02:05:35,417 --> 02:05:37,000
One girl drinks with a guy

2079
02:05:37,458 --> 02:05:38,958
Another girl sleeps
with a guy...

2080
02:05:39,125 --> 02:05:40,000
I am a virgin guy

2081
02:05:40,083 --> 02:05:41,542
I need a virgin girl...

2082
02:05:41,917 --> 02:05:45,125
If you say that again,
I will slap you

2083
02:05:45,417 --> 02:05:46,125
Jeeva...

2084
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:49,542
Those times were all gone...

2085
02:05:49,833 --> 02:05:52,833
I am sure I will get someone

2086
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:54,875
I will find out...

2087
02:05:54,917 --> 02:05:59,583
Wait...God will
give you a hand...

2088
02:05:59,625 --> 02:06:02,292
You hold it tight...

2089
02:06:02,333 --> 02:06:03,792
The train is leaving....Move

2090
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:10,333
That was a waste of time...

2091
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:15,333
Open the door....

2092
02:06:16,375 --> 02:06:17,875
Even the train is leaving me...

2093
02:06:24,917 --> 02:06:27,542
God will give you a hand...

2094
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:30,958
If you hold it tight...

2095
02:06:43,375 --> 02:06:45,042
You should have watched
your steps...

2096
02:06:45,125 --> 02:06:46,125
I have....

2097
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,500
And now I am here...

2098
02:06:51,667 --> 02:06:52,917
Open the door...

2099
02:06:53,792 --> 02:06:56,042
If not Trisha, then Nayanthara

2100
02:06:56,333 --> 02:06:57,167
If not Nayanthara..?

2101
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:58,500
Priya Anand...

2102
02:07:02,125 --> 02:07:03,625
Where are you going?

2103
02:07:04,417 --> 02:07:06,333
Tiruchi...You?

2104
02:07:06,625 --> 02:07:07,958
Then I am coming to Tiruchi...
