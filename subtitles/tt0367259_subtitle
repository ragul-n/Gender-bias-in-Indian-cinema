00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,980


3
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,570
" Whoever believes in Allah and the last day "

4
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,720
" let him maintain strong family ties "

5
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,940
A Hadith that I came across which made me
decide to 

6
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,500
make a surprise visit to my sister in pennsylvania

7
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,380
when I read it I was overcome by shame

8
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,040
since the last time I actually saw my
sister was last year

9
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,500
when she asked me to babysit her
daughter Fatima

10
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,520
my sister asked me to take care of Fatima for a few days

11
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,020
as she was about
to give birth to a second daughter

12
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,320
to be completely honest I had no clue
how to take care of a baby girl

13
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,390
I could hardly take care of myself

14
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,350
but I couldn't say no to my sister.

15
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,860


16
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,180
when my brother-in-law dropped her off

17
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,800
she didn't even know how to say my name

18
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,020
I had no idea how I was supposed to entertain her

19
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,360
I didn't even know how to break the ice

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,580
so I started reflecting on how the Prophet Mohammed peace be upon

21
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,860
dealt with the children around him

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,740
 the Prophet Mohammed peace be upon him was

23
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,040
so loving to everyone

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,520
but at the same time he was particularly compassionate to children

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,860
he would constantly be seen playing with
them joking with them

26
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,980
embracing them visiting them when they
were sick

27
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,120
 lifting their spirits when they were down 

28
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,450
he would even try to speak to the
non-arab children in their own languages

29
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,090
just to show them that he loved them
just as much

30
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,910
and a young girl could take his hand in
walking all around Madina

31
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,710
without him letting go her hand until
she let go of his

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,640
When Al-Hasan and Al-Hussein used to jump on his back while he was he was praying

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,310
used to wait for them to come down and
then place them on his lap gently

34
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,370
he once said when I stand for prayer

35
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,769
I enjoyed prolonging it but once I hear
a child crying

36
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,829
I cut it short so that I don't cause
distress to the child's mother

37
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,780
we often get impatient with children
forgetting that were once them

38
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,790
and sometimes still act like them and
one day they will be like us

39
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,350
and hopefully show us mercy the way we
showed it to them

40
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,579
the Prophet peace be upon him showed
interest in their interests

41
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:51,590
he played with their toys even once
asked about one of the kids birds

42
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,590


43
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,000
 we seem to forget at times that
loving children is of the easiest sunnahs

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,540
and of the easiest ways by which we
gain Allah's love

45
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,819
for our Prophet peace be upon him said :
" that those who do not show compassion "

46
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,739
" will not receive it "  

47
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,159
compassion is a
natural part of our humanity

48
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,660
and it's even further enhanced through our islam

49
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,260
however if it isn't cherished and exhibited we may lose it forever

50
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,220
Imagine how different the world would be

51
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,699
if we're all just a little bit more loving and kind to our family members

52
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,500
and love is not only expressed through words

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,100
the Prophet peace be upon him

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,370
despite carrying the weight of the world
on his shoulders

55
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,530
still paid attention to the small things

56
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,910
like drinking from the same part of the glass

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,420
sneaking in a surprise kiss 

58
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,540
even
challenging you to a surprise race

59
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,720
there wasn't a chore to small nor moment
too quick for him 

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,940
to show you that he loved you

61
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,620
and was paying close attention to you

62
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,820
Oh Fatima

63
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,760
you have no idea how much I miss 

64
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,440
you may be young  but you've taught me so much

65
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,200
you've taught me how to follow the
example of our greatest teacher

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,490
in being loving and caring towards ones family

67
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,099
RasulAllah

68
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,079
I don't know how you did it

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,180
how you managed to care for the this ummah

70
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,539
the way you did all being anything but
neglectful to your family

71
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,500
your greatness as a husband and father

72
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,500
was just as remarkable as your greatness as a leader
