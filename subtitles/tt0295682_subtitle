1
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:23,272


3
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:17,760
Take me with you!

4
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,727
I will not bother you.

5
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,141
When you'll grow up.

6
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,851
Always you say that.

7
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,024
Turn.

8
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:42,248
Where is your knife?

9
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:50,659
How shall we make you a warrior
if you loose your knife all the time?

10
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:20,462
It was your grandfather's

11
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:26,762
He gave it to me,when I started
to work for the master.

12
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:33,390
Now it is yours.

13
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,061
I promise to take care of it.

14
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,854
Come, Katimba.

15
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,817
Inside.

16
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:08,641
It is doublefaced

17
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,184
-How much?
-Two hundred.

18
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:18,813
Two hundred each.

19
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:38,459
I'll take these.

20
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,134
You stay here.

21
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:49,644
Come and buy shawls

22
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:52,691
Madam,look that
beautiful sawl...

23
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,498
Next!

24
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:51,930
Master, we didnt have
monsoons this year...

25
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,684
Our village had very
poor field crop.

26
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,855
These are all we have.

27
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,858
Where are these from?

28
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,783
From the Tarag village.

29
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,992
Is that happened again before?

30
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:21,007
I am your faithful slave.
Please forgive me.

31
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,318
Next!

32
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,163
Come here...

33
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,095
Watch your step...
I said watch out.

34
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:18,147
Brother.

35
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,167
The Tarag village.
Give them a lesson.

36
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:30,408
They are peasents.
We'll have some fun.

37
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:05,445
Just follow the order.

38
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:09,040
You used to come before.
Forgot?...

39
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:13,295
Bring your horse!

40
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:24,394
Don't you ever talk back to me.

41
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,890
Ok.

42
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,547
Katimba...Come inside!

43
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:07,020
Come here...

44
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:15,782
What is going on?

45
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:42,356
No one leaves from my services.
No one.

46
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:47,113
I want his head till dawn.

47
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:49,734
If you'll not...

48
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:53,530
I'll cut off yours.

49
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:14,253
Protect us to the journey home.

50
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:16,791
I'll not draw a sword again.
Forgive me.

51
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:33,022
Don't lose it, Katimba.

52
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:35,573
I must leave.I'll be in trouble

53
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:38,029
- Where are you going?
- To Koulou.

54
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,416
Where is your father?

55
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:50,419
Where is he ?

56
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:03,865
- Him!

57
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:25,383
- I am not sure, he is.

58
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,813
Bring the boy.

59
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:32,717
Is that your father?

60
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:46,229
Is your father?

61
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:54,121
Answer!

62
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:02,536
Yes,he is my father.

63
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,524
They are coming!

64
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:27,900
I believed it was him.

65
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,773
They were heading home.

66
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,619
I think they are
at the ironmonger.

67
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:09,928
Faster!

68
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:26,646
Are you a gimpy?

69
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:03,449
Go back to your work, Riaz!

70
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:12,130
Back to work!

71
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:21,261
Pick it up. Bring it over here!

72
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:38,364
Are you still thirsty?

73
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:47,455
You want to drink more?...Do you?

74
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:29,343
Did you saw someone to pass by here?

75
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:32,182
Where did he go?

76
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:36,432
Over here!

77
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:11,968
- What do you want?
- Something cheap.

78
00:42:12,684 --> 00:42:15,806
You'll not find cheapest than here.

79
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:26,408
Potatos and ''tsapati''.

80
00:44:08,953 --> 00:44:11,195
What's your name?

81
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,334
Where are you heading?

82
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:35,934
- What's your name?
- Tumara. Yours?

83
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:39,818
Go home.

84
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:43,697
Why are you follow me?

85
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:54,215
Why those men stare at you?

86
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,321
Where are you going?

87
00:46:55,324 --> 00:46:58,326
Does not worry your parents
about you?

88
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:00,659
No.

89
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:03,658
Why?

90
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:06,079
Let it be.

91
00:47:07,047 --> 00:47:09,170
What happened?

92
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,351
What realy happened?

93
00:47:26,738 --> 00:47:28,866
I'll tell you...

94
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:32,651
When I was young, some men
came to our village.

95
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:36,365
Riding on horses. They put
fire to our houses

96
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:41,254
If people tried to escape,
they killed them.

97
00:47:41,715 --> 00:47:45,219
A man came to our house...

98
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:47,888
He had long hair...

99
00:47:47,888 --> 00:47:51,673
I saw him, but I was scared
and did nothing.

100
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:55,852
He...

101
00:47:57,024 --> 00:48:00,193
Killed my family.

102
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:12,163
Now you know.

103
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:21,583
I'll come back

104
00:50:01,553 --> 00:50:03,879
Are you ok?

105
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:10,606
I'm waiting for someone.

106
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:36,668
What are doing?

107
00:50:36,888 --> 00:50:40,305
- Do you steal?
-I'll pay...

108
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,428
- With what you'll pay?
- I have money...

109
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:48,936
- Where did you get the money?
- To whom they belong?

110
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:04,080
- I didn't steal them.
Let me go!

111
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:45,590
- Where are you going?
- To Koulou.

112
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,595
- Why?
- I was born there.

113
00:51:51,897 --> 00:51:55,017
- Do you have a wife, children?

114
00:51:55,985 --> 00:52:01,906
No? When I'll grow up I'll have
a wife,children,big house.

115
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:04,694
And a lot of chickens.

116
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,501
- Where are you going?
- To the Sacred Lake.

117
00:53:25,846 --> 00:53:29,216
- Where is that lake?
- On the mountains.

118
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:21,278
- Let me down.
I dont need your help.

119
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:24,746
- I'll continue alone.

120
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:31,296
Your face is written blood.

121
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:57,955
Shall I marry a rich woman?
Shall I have a big house?

122
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,791
A thief.

123
00:55:30,415 --> 00:55:34,545
She was right about me.
How about you?...

124
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,801
Who did you kill?

125
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:30,435
What are you waiting?

126
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:12,249
Did you know that he was coming?

127
00:57:22,512 --> 00:57:24,634
What are you doing here?

128
00:57:25,098 --> 00:57:29,676
She wants to go to the Sacred Lake
and him at Koulou.

129
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,857
And how about you?

130
00:57:31,857 --> 00:57:35,106
Someone has to take care of them.

131
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,074
Well?

132
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,245
What happened here?

133
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:19,546
What is wrong?

134
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:22,806
Go back! The warriors
 are here!

135
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:25,477
At the village...
They look for someone.

136
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,459
You are a warrior, right?

137
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:56,552
I was.

138
01:01:57,223 --> 01:02:00,641
How many have you killed?

139
01:02:06,485 --> 01:02:09,321
Did you kill?

140
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:56,034
Go on...Take them to the
Sacred Lake.

141
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,539
Be careful.

142
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:06,724
Come here...

143
01:03:18,286 --> 01:03:20,445
Take care.

144
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:38,300
What do you want?

145
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:44,591
Nothing left here.

146
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:51,353
We are only me and you.
Pick up your sword.

147
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:18,264
You look like peasant...

148
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:23,812
For that you left?
To be like that?

149
01:09:34,873 --> 01:09:37,791
You taught me that life.

150
01:09:38,335 --> 01:09:41,706
I will not let you to give it up.

151
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:14,187
- The money...
- I will not pay...

152
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:18,856
- It was disgusting
- But you ate it all.

153
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:21,785
I didn't like it.

154
01:12:38,224 --> 01:12:41,474
I dont care if you are poor.
I will not eat here again.

155
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:12,495
Tea?

156
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:35,097
We need some help here.

157
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:36,892
Mom...he woke up.

158
01:21:22,492 --> 01:21:25,495
She said you'll come.

159
01:21:41,558 --> 01:21:44,130
Take care of the fire.
