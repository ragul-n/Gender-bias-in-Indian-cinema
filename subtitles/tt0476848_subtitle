00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:21,251

He had the responsibility
of marrying off his sister.

29
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:12,299
Day and night this was the
thought that rode his mind.

55
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:06,412
'ln those days Gopal Narayan
Tiwari was very well known.'

56
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:08,920
'He was a very well known chef.'

57
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:13,426
'God has his ways. He
died in a kitchen too.'

58
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:16,428
'ln Jhullan's wedding he
was cooking green peas.'

59
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:19,431
'He breathed his
last holding his chest.'

60
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,434
'At that time Ramji
was 12 years old.'

61
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:26,438
'And Parvati his younger
sister was 7 years old.'

62
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:30,101
'At that time Ramji threw
his text books and note books..

63
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:32,440
..and got into his father's shoes.'

64
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:35,447
'He has turned out to be a
better chef than his father.'

65
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:37,449
'And he has just one dream..

66
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:41,451
..to wed Parvati lavishly.'

67
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:45,948
'He didn't even spend
a penny for himself.'

68
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,460
'He saved every penny
for Parvati's wedding.'

69
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,463
'And today is that day.'

70
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,462
'The wedding is so grand..

71
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:57,469
..that the entire
village is wide-eyed.'

72
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,801
What is this aunty,
Again the same story.

73
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:02,467
Grandpa, grandma, Pandey-ji is here!

74
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:05,477
Pandey-ji greetings! -
Tomorrow come over to the factory,

75
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,479
Greetings! - Welcome!

76
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:09,481
No. Right now, l'm
at a family function.

77
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,484
Where has this Radhe disappeared?

78
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:14,815
He'll totally ruin my reputation.

79
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,985
Congratulations Mishra-ji.

80
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,493
Hey Papua..
- Yes.

81
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:27,499
Did you see Radhe?

82
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:28,829
No. l didn't see him.
- Where the hell did he go?

83
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,852
Bless you.
- Be happy.

84
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,525
May God bless you with
lots of kids, child!

85
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:05,537
My son gave away all the money.

86
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:09,539
The Lord only knows, what
sacrifice my son has given..

87
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,542
..to collect so much money.
- Thank you very much.

88
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,547
Radhe.. Radhe..

89
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,550
What's the matter? Any problem?

90
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:21,551
l don't know where
the hell is that Radhe?

91
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,555
Radhe? The barber?
- Yes. - There, he is sitting.

92
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:26,558
He is still eating there.

93
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,560
l was tired looking for him and
he is sitting here and belching.

94
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,562
l will..!

95
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,154
Does the bride's
father-in-law need a shave?

96
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:35,065
l would be blessed if he
doesn't shave me off! - What!

97
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:39,571
What is it dear? So
much time to count it!

98
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,574
l think you're
counting it peacefully.

99
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,577
l'm not being able to face her father
-in-law since morning. - Why not?

100
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:50,576
l had to take the dowry money
from Radhe and give it to him.

101
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,916
Then what was that which l gave
him, wrapped in a red cloth. Ram-ji..

102
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,920
l'm almost finished. lt is 251 .

103
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,927
Have you confirmed that it is
the right amount? - Yes father.

104
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:05,590
Now keep it in the
cupboard and lock it, all right.

105
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,599
l'll go to the bank
tomorrow morning and deposit it.

106
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,601
ln a bank?!

107
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,933
l'm sorry to interrupt, father.

108
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,599
But there is no need to go that far.

109
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,606
We will call
Chaurasia-ji here and have it done.

110
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,611
Will you have raw
betel nut or roasted?

111
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,616
Betel nut!

112
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,615
Are you out of your mind?

113
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,620
You're the limit!

114
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:30,622
What had we decided?

115
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,956
l was ready to marry your daughter
without having a look at her. Why?

116
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,121
So that l could use the
dowry money you would give me..

117
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:38,960
..to pay for Parvati's dowry.

118
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,624
And you are not at all concerned!

119
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,634
Give me the money.

120
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:46,968
What is this? Bank draft!
You're the limit!

121
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:06,658
She eloped and took the
money along with her too.

122
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:10,662
She writes that she won't
marry a stinking chef like you.

123
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:18,670
Do you think l'm a fool, like you?

124
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:22,001
Did you think l won't know
the difference between..

125
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,667
..a betel leaf and a note?

126
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:31,673
Look Ram-ji, if l wish, l can
destroy your reputation right now.

127
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:35,687
Look at my son.. ls he
lying on the footpath?

128
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:38,016
He reads weather
report on television.

129
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:39,683
The weather condition..

130
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,695
The chief minister doesn't fly his
helicopter till he listens to him.

131
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:48,700
lf you had any problem,
you could have told me.

132
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,702
We could have
thought of something else.

133
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,703
But l don't
understand this betel leaf.

134
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,706
Forgive us.

135
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:00,712
We were hoping to get the money
from somewhere, but we didn't.

136
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,714
That's why this trouble.

137
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,215
He has arranged for everything..

138
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,718
..made the wedding
preparations beyond his means.

139
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,720
He has cooked the
feast himself and..

140
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,723
..desert and ice-cream
has also been arranged for.

141
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,725
Kulfi.. Kulfi..

142
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:16,887
Yes. Did you have it?
Someone get some kulfi for sir.

143
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,726
To hell with your kulfi!

144
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,056
You can get kulfi or an ice-slab.

145
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,897
But l'll not cool down. That's it.

146
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,231
Listen..
- What is it?

147
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,896
Pandey-ji is leaving.

148
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:27,735
Shouldn't we give
him the parting gift?

149
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,741
l'm coming. l'm coming. Come on.

150
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:37,749
Look Ram-ji, the wedding
has already taken place.

151
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,751
We'll take the bride with us.

152
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,753
l'm respecting you.
- Thank you very much.

153
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,254
No, no, no. The wedding is over..

154
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,756
..but it doesn't mean
that we have been duped.

155
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:49,761
We have a solution for all rituals.

156
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,760
He takes so much trouble.

157
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,769
Even when it rains, he
goes on his scooter to read..

158
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,771
..the weather report on television.

159
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:04,770
When he sits before the camera,
water drips from his hair.

160
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,779
Tell me, what is the solution?

161
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,275
Do you have any solution?

162
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,942
Do you?

163
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:14,782
We had bought a new
raincoat to go to the temple.

164
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:17,789
But if you wish we
can buy a new one.

165
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:20,790
You are talking about
umbrellas and raincoats!

166
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,795
Will he wear a
raincoat in the hot season?

167
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,797
He doesn't have to
sit in a kitchen..

168
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:29,795
..and cook throughout the day.

169
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:32,794
He appears on the TV.

170
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,806
All of Bihar watches him.

171
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:40,806
You should buy a nice
second hand car for him.

172
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:46,818
Listen, he may rot in Patna alone.

173
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:50,822
But till you don't
buy a car for him..

174
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,154
..they won't
celebrate their first night.

175
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:56,320
What are you saying father!
First night is a must.

176
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:57,829
Shut up!

177
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,832
Why do you interrupt when
two elders are speaking?

178
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,834
Get out from here!

179
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,995
The entire village got together
to get this wedding accomplished.

180
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,005
Now where will we find a used car?

181
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:09,837
There is no need to discuss anymore.

182
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,843
What l said is final.

183
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,846
Now you have to arrange for it.
- All right.

184
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,850
What has happened, Chhotu uncle!

185
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,855
We got involved with such people!

186
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:31,192
He is even ashamed
of my being a chef.

187
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,399
He says that if
their relatives ask me..

188
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,867
..then l should tell
that l'm a farmer.

189
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:42,868
Chhotu uncle, will our
Parvati be happy there?

190
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,873
Have a juice, chill out!

191
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,205
Have a juice, chill out!

192
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:50,040
Have a juice..
- Take a break!

193
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:53,051
Have fun! Have fun!

194
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,882
ls it juice or a cough syrup?!

195
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,218
There is no more than two
spoons full in every glass.

196
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,383
And you don't allow
finishing that too.

197
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,895
Do you know that Ramji is getting
his sister married by borrowing money!

198
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,896
When it is your daughter's turn, l'll
mix juice concentrate in the well..

199
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:07,899
..and make the
entire village drink it.

200
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,232
Give me now.. - l'll give
you an entire glass! Listen..

201
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:14,234
You look disturbed, Ramji.

202
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:15,899
Don't hesitate to ask me
if you need some help. - Yes.

203
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,900
Like you, she is our sister too.

204
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:21,913
No, nothing's the matter.
l'm just a bit tired.

205
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:24,245
lf something lacked in the
wedding arrangements, then..

206
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,252
Lacked..! You have done so well!

207
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,912
What is lacking?

208
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:31,252
Did you have food and
today's special item?

209
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,916
Yes l had. lt was very good. Oh
yes! l saw you taking it 3 times.

210
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:36,928
Ok. Thanks for coming. Bye!
- Bye!

211
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,930
Bye!
- Bye!

212
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:43,926
Kinsmen, l accept
that l made a mistake.

213
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,938
But l'll arrange
for the money anyhow.

214
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,439
At least don't insult
me before the guests.

215
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:52,943
So you have separated it!

216
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,947
ls my respect separate from yours?

217
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,949
Don't estrange me in this way.

218
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,952
Money does not matter to me.

219
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,955
You're more valuable to me.

220
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,952
Shall l call the doctor?

221
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,960
Good joke!

222
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:11,961
You are very fortunate!

223
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,965
Do you speak English?

224
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:15,957
Yes.. Somewhat.

225
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:17,969
Then come.. come with me.

226
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:20,972
Meet him.. Pandey-ji.

227
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,974
Pandey-ji, he is Ramji.
- Greetings!

228
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:28,980
Wow! How tasty!

229
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,984
lt feels like the Goddess of
Taste herself came down to earth.

230
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,318
What a cook you are, gentleman!

231
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,984
He speaks English too! Speak up.

232
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,993
No. l'm not a chef.

233
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,995
l'm a farmer.

234
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:48,998
Cook.. Cook? He has
cooked all this food.

235
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:52,333
All of you, say something!
- Yes.. Yes. He has cooked it.

236
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:55,169
He cooks all kinds of food,
English, lndian.

237
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:58,335
He cooks that too. What's
the name.. Spicy spaghetti.

238
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,014
Poodle.

239
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,011
Noodle.

240
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,024
Yes, that's it. He's a very
good chef! A very good chef!

241
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,026
Cook.. He is a cook!

242
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:18,029
All of you, say something.

243
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,531
No one can match him
in entire Bihar. - Yes.

244
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,363
He is a chef from childhood.

245
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,027
He is related from
Badki aunty's side.

246
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:27,038
His name is Advocate Choube.

247
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:31,042
After going there..

248
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,374
..he became Vicky Choube.

249
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:39,044
He has settled down well in London.

250
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:41,052
He has got an NRl card too.

251
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:49,060
When he had come here 6
months back, he was very troubled.

252
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:53,064
Eating the junk food over there,
he had grown fat all over.

253
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:59,060
That time he had mentioned
that he needs a vegetarian cook.

254
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,072
A cook!.. Vegetarian cook!

255
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,065
He will get 400

256
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:09,080
400! But Ramji gets 3500
/- even here, isn't it? - Yes.

257
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:12,413
lt's pounds. 400 pounds. Not rupees.

258
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,420
And one pound is worth Rs.
80/-. Now calculate.

259
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,082
Speak up son. Calculate.

260
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:20,585
Have you gone further then Chhapra?

261
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:26,097
That means 20-22000 rupees!

262
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,097
For a month or a year?

263
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,102
Not 20-22000 rupees.

264
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,105
lt's 30000 per month.

265
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,110
l was looking for a
cook since many days.

266
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,112
As soon as l dined here, l knew..

267
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,116
..my search is over.

268
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:50,115
When l enquired about the chef, l came
to know that he is the bride's brother!

269
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:53,124
He is here only for you! Take him.

270
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:56,127
There is no one else for him here.

271
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,129
Go on lad!

272
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,131
Listen, pack his bags.

273
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,134
No..
- No!

274
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:06,137
How can l..

275
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,140
Over there.. English would be..

276
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,145
l have not completed my studies too.
l'm just eighth standard pass. And..

277
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,474
What is this? Such educated people..

278
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:21,145
..are no match to my Ramji.

279
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:26,151
Listen son. Why are
you getting upset?

280
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:29,154
lf you feel right, then go.

281
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:33,164
And if you don't like it there,
come back by the next bus.

282
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,161
Why bus! lt is so close!

283
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,169
Ramji can walk back.

284
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:43,174
He'll have to go across
seven seas, isn't it Pandey-ji?

285
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:46,507
Look, l can easily send him.

286
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,173
But we should know his wish too.

287
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,173
So l have an advice. Think calmly..

288
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:56,517
..talk it over with the family,
and then tell me.

289
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,682
Are you not family!

290
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:02,193
What is there to ask! Take him away.

291
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:05,196
Our life will be made.

292
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:08,199
l mean his life will be made.
Such opportunities don't come often.

293
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:12,203
Who does he have here?
Just a sister.

294
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:15,206
Won't you go for her?

295
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:18,209
Come on! Arrange for
his departure! Come on.

296
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:22,211
So Ramji, what do you say?
Shall we make the arrangements?

297
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,228
ln whose name shall l offer prayers?

298
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,395
Gopal Narayan Tiwari.

299
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:45,233
'Oh Lord! l've served you for my life.
Sending him there to earn money..'

300
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:49,240
'Lord, please get rid of bad
omen from my wedding night..'

301
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:52,243
'Lord, my brother is going overseas
for the first time, take care of him.'

302
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:57,248
'Take care of Ramji. - My son's
future is connected to Ramji.'

303
00:18:57,316 --> 00:19:00,251
'You're sending me because
so many people wish me to go..

304
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,253
..you must have thought
of something good for me.'

305
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,255
'Take care of me.'

306
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,257
The couple looks good..

307
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:12,263
..but her in-laws seem to be greedy.

308
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,264
No sooner Parvati goes there..

309
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:18,269
..she'll win over
everyone's heart with her goodness.

310
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:20,271
Their greed will be forgotten.

311
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,270
Yes, their home
will become abundant.

312
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,275
But our house will become lonely.

313
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:26,277
Yes, everything will be lonely.

314
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,280
Hey, Pappua..

315
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:37,618
What happened? You look worried.

316
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:46,297
l'm tired.

317
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:51,632
Rest for a while. Your
heart will lighten up.

318
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:04,313
Cut it properly. Don't
you have a machine? - No.

319
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:07,477
And if there was a machine, would l've
pushed it in your nose. - Do your work.

320
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:11,319
ls everything fine? Abdul take
his measurement. And listen.

321
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,325
After that shave the
hair in his armpits too.

322
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,327
The skin burns by cutting there.

323
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:20,329
lt doesn't burn if your apply powder.
Apply powder & everything will be cool.

324
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,492
Brother, get up. l want
to take your measurement.

325
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:24,331
lf he gets up then
how will l do my work!

326
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,337
lf he doesn't get up then how
will l take his measurement!

327
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,666
ls there any problem in doing
both the work simultaneously?

328
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,676
Tell me one thing? lt
doesn't burn if you apply powder?

329
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:34,338
No, not at all. Then shave it.

330
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,347
What is this? The nose
work is not done.

331
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:38,349
He's taking the measurement. And the
armpit hair job is also going on.

332
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,678
lf he is wounded then don't tell me.

333
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,345
You're acting strangely.

334
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,685
l'm going abroad. And you
all are getting anxious.

335
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:47,351
Someone says shave it.
Someone says stitch it.

336
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,690
Why are you getting angry?
You only are going abroad.

337
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,354
But go like a human.

338
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,364
Where are you
going with this jungle?

339
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,366
Leave me, stupid.

340
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,698
From where did you get this sample?

341
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,362
Where's Mohammad?

342
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:02,532
Mohammad himself said that his son has
full information of the current trend.

343
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:05,702
Take him only. Look what a
stylish jacket he has worn.

344
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:07,370
l've myself stitched this.

345
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:11,380
When there was a shooting
in Baisonkot last year..

346
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,386
..then he only had stitched
Chunky Pandey's pant. Am l right?

347
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:17,388
There was a shot of
climbing on the horse..

348
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,890
..the horse was a wild one.
lt used to stagger on two feet.

349
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,553
When Chunky climbed the horse.
The horse threw him.

350
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,391
lt's good that the poor
person had worn only pants.

351
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,725
lf you call this
stitching than what is darning?

352
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,395
Okay, it's darning. But Chunky
Pandey shook hands with me only

353
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,732
Stupid!

354
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:35,399
You're saying that by
stitching clothes from you..

355
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:37,738
..one day Amitabh Bachchan will
come and say, shake hands with me.

356
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,573
Don't take Amitabh Bachchan's name.

357
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:42,409
l become very excited
when l hear his name.

358
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:44,742
l have only one wish.

359
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:47,752
As people know Amitabh
Bachchan due to his acting just..

360
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,415
..like that one day Amitabh Bachchan
should know me by my cooking skill.

361
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,583
He'll surely know you. He
is the super star of movies.

362
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:56,423
And you the super star of cooking.

363
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,760
Don't waste your time in chatting.
Take his measurement.

364
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:09,434
ln the water of foreign.

365
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,444
He'll get mixed.

366
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:17,446
ln the water of foreign,
he'll get mixed.

367
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:21,452
Your senses will
open up in foreign.

368
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,781
Don't forget, don't forget,
don't forget.

369
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,448
lf you apply powder it won't burn.

370
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:28,459
Don't forget, don't forget,
don't forget.

371
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,463
Don't forget, don't forget.

372
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,460
This is called passport.
Take it with you.

373
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,625
Keep it carefully with you.

374
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:40,467
This. - Yes. - l have to
take it with me. - Yes.

375
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,473
lt even has my snap.

376
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,475
So where do l take it?
Here or there?

377
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:47,808
Yes when they ask you there, open it &
show to them. Then close it and keep it.

378
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,815
There too? - Yes, there too.
- l'm confused.

379
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:54,475
Give it to me. lt's passport.
lt will get lost.

380
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,488
Don't give it to anyone.
Keep it with you safely.

381
00:22:57,823 --> 00:22:59,814
Keep it with myself?
- Yes.

382
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:03,487
Don't forget, don't forget,
don't forget, don't forget.

383
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:22,841
Don't forget, don't forget,
don't forget, don't forget.

384
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:26,510
Don't forget, don't forget,
don't forget, don't forget.

385
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:34,523
Let no one cast
an evil eye on you.

386
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:41,532
Let no one cast an evil eye on my Ramji,
let no one cast an evil eye on you.

387
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,536
Let no one cast an
evil eye on my Ramji.

388
00:23:55,614 --> 00:23:59,550
For how long we're waiting here
but the bus has still not come.

389
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,552
How much time is there
for this bus to come?

390
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,884
Once he sits on the plane then in 12
hours he'll reach London. - Really!

391
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:09,558
He will mess up
everything in this time.

392
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:11,562
What!

393
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,565
As if instead of wings he has
to fly by fluttering his hand.

394
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:18,569
The plane will fly. He only has to
sit inside wearing his seat belt.

395
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:23,574
Else? By the time we'll reach Patna,
we can watch atleast one movie.

396
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,906
Don't wait for the seat
by standing in the line.

397
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:27,741
Run and grab the window seat.

398
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,577
No, they were saying that
it's not the window seat.

399
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:33,914
And they've given me loads of
documents. l don't know what to do.

400
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,580
Ramji, take care of your
luggage while changing the flight.

401
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,919
There is a danger
of it getting stolen.

402
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,585
This problem must not
be in Singapore. - Why?

403
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,595
Because Nepali
people are very honest.

404
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,927
Nepalese? ln Singapore?

405
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,593
By the way, how did
Nepalese come in Singapore?

406
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,761
Then what. Don't you know..

407
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:55,204
..all flat nose people are there.

408
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:58,607
Flat nose? Are all
flat nose people Nepalese?

409
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:01,111
Our Sandeep's nose too is flat.

410
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,614
Does it make him a Nepalese?

411
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:06,617
How did Singapore come on the road?
- The bus has come! lt has come!

412
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:09,618
Okay, father, l'll take your leave.

413
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:11,619
l'll call you when l reach there.

414
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:14,619
Take care of Chutki. She's a kid.

415
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:17,956
lf she makes any mistake, then
forgive her like your own child.

416
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,123
Don't you worry, Ramji.

417
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,793
She's like a daughter. And
she'll remain like one. - Okay.

418
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:26,634
Take care of your diet.

419
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,639
Don't forget to send the money.

420
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:30,965
No, l'm going for that only.

421
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,637
Okay.
- Okay, l'll leave.

422
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:37,648
Pappu, l'm leaving too many
responsibilities on your shoulders.

423
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,644
Take care of yourself.

424
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:45,656
Keep this safely with you.

425
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,660
lt's not much. Just a little.

426
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:57,157
Count and bring the things
written in the list. Remember.

427
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:01,672
Chutki, why are you crying?

428
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,005
Brother, take care of yourself.

429
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:09,173
Look, l don't want to go
abroad seeing your crying face.

430
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:12,684
l'm doing all this for
you only. Now smile.

431
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:15,686
Yes.

432
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:19,184
And don't give your
in-laws a chance to complain.

433
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:20,691
And do write letter.

434
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,023
While writing letter,
don't complain about anyone.

435
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:27,691
lf someone reads it, then
it will create a problem.

436
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:32,703
lf there is some trouble,
write in pencil, l'll understand.

437
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,701
Okay, l'll leave.

438
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,714
Stop! Hurry up.

439
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:46,717
Give me my bag.
- Okay, my dear. - l'll leave.

440
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:49,720
Thank you.
- Take care of yourself.

441
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:52,723
Do write letter.

442
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:56,727
Ramji, remember my list.

443
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:58,729
lt's not very big.

444
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:01,061
Don't forget.

445
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:04,728
Hello. - Hello. - This way towards
the end. - Thank you. - Thank you.

446
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:10,068
Hello. Could you sit down over there?
lt's right down the end. Thank you.

447
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:13,734
Hello. Over there.

448
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:38,100
Hi.
- Say good things, brother.

449
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:42,102
No, l mean greetings.
- Oh! Greetings.

450
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,766
How are you? - Fine.
- Okay.

451
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:47,778
Did you lock it properly?
- Yes.

452
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:52,112
Wow! You've put the lock too.
- Yes. - And chain too? - Yes.

453
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:54,778
lt looks like you're a
regular traveler to London.

454
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:58,787
No, but why did you ask?

455
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:02,793
You've come fully prepared,
that's why.

456
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:08,128
Look, suitcase, chain, lock..
and pickle too.

457
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,794
Yes, the aroma is coming.

458
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:13,133
That's why it looks like
you're regular visitor.

459
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,799
No, l'm going there
for the first time.

460
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,138
But this is common sense.

461
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,304
You should be fully
prepared when you go out.

462
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:28,809
Why is she wearing
this strange coat?

463
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:32,823
She is saying that the life
jacket beneath your seat..

464
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:35,826
..by wearing that a
person doesn't drown.

465
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:38,158
lf this plane crashes
into the water, then.

466
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,822
Crashes?
- Yes. - ln water?

467
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,832
Yes, it will crash.

468
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,834
But l don't know
whether in land or water.

469
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,833
Excuse me, sir.

470
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,835
Sir, stand up, please.

471
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:52,843
Not now. Please, remove it.

472
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,846
No, l'll keep wearing it.
l'll give it to you later.

473
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:57,848
No, if we were to land in water,
it would help you.

474
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,851
Look, after falling in the water, where
will l search for you? So let me wear it.

475
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:03,012
No, sir, you don't understand.
You have to take it off.

476
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:06,023
No let me.. after landing there,
l'll give it to you. - Tell him.

477
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:08,025
You have to take this off. You have to
take this off. - Make them understand.

478
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:10,186
Pull it. - What's this?

479
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:12,853
What happened?
- God!

480
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:16,196
Remove it. - O my God! - No need
for the plane to crash in the water.

481
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:17,860
This only will suffocate me.

482
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,867
Remove it.
- Hold on.

483
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,894
Why are you looking at me? Go.

484
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,895
lt is very small.

485
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:54,905
What is this?
They've kept it higher.

486
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:57,908
You go, what are you looking at?

487
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,237
ls this for a human or a pigeon?

488
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,913
Excuse me, there is some
man in the toilet.

489
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:10,249
And we've been waiting for so long.

490
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:12,256
What's he doing for so long? - l'm
been waiting really long, ma'am.

491
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:14,918
Okay, okay. Don't worry,
let me see what's wrong.

492
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:19,253
Excuse me.
- Yes. - Hi, can l help you, sir?

493
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:21,265
What?
- Can l help you?

494
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:28,938
Do you have a tumbler?
- Tumbler? - Yes.

495
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:30,938
What tumbler?

496
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:35,105
l've checked. There is no mug or
vessel here. Can l get a tumbler?

497
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,946
No, sir. You'll have to
use the paper only. - Paper?

498
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:40,951
l can't use paper.

499
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:44,955
We consider paper to be a sacred
thing. We don't even stamp on it.

500
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:48,117
And you're saying.. - No, no.
Please, sir, you've to use paper only.

501
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:49,956
Many people are
waiting in the queue.

502
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:52,963
You people endure
it for a bit longer.

503
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:55,966
There is no wait here. lf
you come in, you'll get stuck.

504
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:57,968
l'm badly stuck.

505
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:02,473
Those idiots! They charge us so much &
they can't even keep a bathroom tumbler.

506
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,974
What a cunning business is this!

507
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,307
Sir.
- Yes, l'm coming. l'm coming.

508
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:10,974
Come on sir. - What are you

Go.

00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,989
O God!
- You people think it is a joke?

512
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,032
Why are they
searching everyone's luggage?

513
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:12,042
We're standing in this line for the past
1 and 1/2 hours. l can't understand it.

But they seem to
be from good family.

516
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:27,047
These are not robbers and dacoits.

517
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,060
They are illegal immigrants.

518
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:33,220
They're been deported.
- Report? - No, not report, deport.

519
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:36,062

00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:07,427
Eatable? No, no, not eatable.

531
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,091
Only touchable.

No tumble, no problem.
And paper finish also.

535
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,108
Oh no! ended up
with meeting a rogue.

536
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:24,108
What's the problem?
- You speak Hindi?

537
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:26,116
Yes. This is pickle.

538
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:30,114
lt's just a pickle
in a jar. lt's okay.

Yeah, it's fine. You can go now.

Where's the door?
The door is on the wrong side.

lt will move ahead or back? Now go.

546
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:54,144
No one came to pick me at the
airport. What kind of people are these?

547
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,146
The meter is running
faster than your car.

548
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,143
lt's so expensive.

549
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,154

Okay.

00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:46,196
So many people have
gathered over here.

562
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:48,198
He looks to be a big shot.

563
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:06,216
Mr. Vicky Chaube?

564
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:20,230
No.

565
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,232
This can't be.

566
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,246
What has happened?

567
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,247
Now what will l do?

568
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,252
Parvati.

569
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:48,255
Mr. Ramji?
- Yes.

570
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,419
Sorry, we couldn't come to
pick you from the airport.

571
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:53,259
You must have
understood the reason for that.

572
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:55,595
Actually we tried to
stop you from coming here.

573
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,261
But you'd already left.

574
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,271
All that is fine.
But what do l do now?

575
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,274
Excuse me.

576
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:07,277
Hello. Yes..

577
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:50,320
What is she saying?
Why is she so annoyed?

578
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:53,323
Tell her that whatever money she
offers me, l'm willing to take it.

579
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:56,326
l'll not only cook food, but
also take care of the whole house.

580
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:59,659
Look, Mr. Ramji, by eating
your lndian spicy food..

581
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:03,326
..her husband Mr.
Chauble died from ulcer.

582
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:05,335
Now they don't
want to keep you here.

583
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:07,667
Look, your return
ticket to lndia is ready.

584
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,502
Keep this money.

585
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,337
And you return to lndia immediately.

586
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:14,344
Look, l can't go
anywhere with this money.

587
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:16,346
This money is too
less to do anything.

588
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:20,851
My people in the village, my sister
Parvati is hopeful of my success.

589
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,352
lf l take this money and return,
then there will be a big problem.

590
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:25,355
l told you she won't
let you stay here.

591
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:27,357
l'll cook not only vegetarian
but non-vegetarian food too.

592
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,518
That is fine.
- l'll look after the whole house.

593
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,858
But..
- How will l face my people?

594
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,366
Listen to me, she won't let you stay
here. - How can you send me like this?

595
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,695
Listen to me.
- l'll look after the whole house.

596
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:24,408
'l'm planning to admit my
child in English school.'

597
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:27,417
'lt's expensive.'

598
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:30,420
'But with your blessings,
that too can be managed.'

599
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,422
'What do you say?
- Yes.'

600
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,921
Yes.

601
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:54,436
What happened?

602
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,644
What happened? Leave my bag.

Are you going to steal?

604
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,445
l won't let you do it.

605
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,453
lf you had been from my village, then
l would have taught you a lesson.

606
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,649
Spare my bag. My things are in it.

607
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:09,659
ls somebody here? - What do
you guys think you're doing?

608
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:12,455
Leave him alone.

609
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,995
Hey, officers. Come here.

610
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:20,463
Leave me. Leave me.

611
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:23,473
Will you steal my bag just like that?
- Hey man, are you all right? - Yeah.

612
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:56,704
My bag, my bag. Where is my bag?

613
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,776
Bag. Who took my bag?

614
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,503
Where's my bag?

615
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:30,674
Guru.
- Give it to me. - Almost done.

616
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,746
What is this? lt's a strange thing.

617
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,552
What happened? Whose child is this?

618
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:50,550
ls someone here?

619
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,886
O my God! Stop!

620

Stop! lt's a car! You'll get hurt!

621
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:02,030
You're very naughty.
Why are you laughing?

622
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:04,767
Whose child is this?
ls someone here?

623
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:07,571
Where is your family?
Here come your parents.

624
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:11,772
Sonu! Sonu! - Sonu! Sonu! Are

625
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:14,577
Are you fine?
- He's all right.

626
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:18,912
We're really, really very grateful
to you. Thank you. - Yeah, thank you.

627
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:22,920
Guru, why is he laughing? - He's
laughing because of my dilemma.

628
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:24,789
Nothing happened. He's fine.

629
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:26,726
But what kind of parents
are you? You left him..

630
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:30,063
..in the middle of the road.
lf he had got..

631
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:31,601
..rolled on the road, then it
would have been a big problem.

632
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:33,796
Be careful.

633
00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:35,599
We're really very sorry.
l don't know.

634
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,275
You are.. from Bihar?

00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,779
You're correct. You're correct.

636
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,810
We're very grateful. Thank you
so much. You saved Sonu's life.

637
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,017
lt's okay.
- Where do you live?

638
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:50,610
Right now l'm on the road.

639
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:52,619
Let's see what happens further.

640
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,619
No really.

641
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:57,617
Are you new in this country?

642
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,625
Yes. lt's been one day.

643
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:04,627
But in this one day, l've
seen the entire lifetime.

644
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:06,834
Raja the great.

645
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:09,700
Look at him.

646
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:12,636
Hey tiger! How are you?

647
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:16,643
Leave my hand. O my God!

648
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:19,646
Guru, he's bleeding. -
lt's nothing, you don't..

649
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:22,151
No. You come with us to our home. l'll
put the dressing. - No need for that.

650
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,651
What's the need to bring him home?

651
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:26,849
There's a hospital nearby.
l'll take him there only.

652
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,651
We'll take him home.

653
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:30,989
What's your name?

654
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:33,858
My name is Ramji.

655
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:37,660
Ramji, l'm Aparna, he's Guru.
- Greetings. - And this is Sonu.

656
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:40,201
Hey, son. You come with
us to our place. Okay?

657
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:44,271
Come.
- Okay. - Do come. - Come.

658
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:47,273
Come on. - Guru brother, is
there a tumbler at your place?

659
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:52,672
Tumbler? - Yes, for my
arrangements of the bathroom.

660
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:56,675
From the time l've come, l
haven't gone to the loo.

661
00:42:56,854 --> 00:42:58,685
My heartbeat increases
when l see the papers.

662
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:11,693
l'll do one thing.

663
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:15,871
l'll put this
pulses and rice for you.

664
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:21,038
You'll have to finish everything without
leaving a grain of rice. Understood?

665
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:22,704
You're a good boy.

666
00:43:24,115 --> 00:43:26,310
No, l won't feed you.

667
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:27,908
You'll have to eat
everything by yourself.

668
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:30,920
Then l'll tell you the
story of the four faced demon.

669
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:33,918
No, no, Ramji. He
can't eat all this stuff.

670
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:37,718
Can't eat?
- No. - ls there a problem?

671
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:40,329
He won't eat. You get up.

672
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:41,922
l've still not eaten my food.

673
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:44,125
l'll give you another plate.
You wash your hands.

674
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:46,733
Come.
- Okay.

675
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:50,738
l want to tell you something about Sonu.
- Sister, you're worrying unnecessarily.

676
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:52,742
All kids have the same problem.

677
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,402
lf you keep food in front of them, they
get so anxious and start doing drama..

678
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,744
Soap. - As if someone is
doing injustice to them.

679
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:01,876
But if they're really hungry.

680
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:05,753
Then keep the plate in front of them
and in 2 minutes it's completely clean.

681
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:09,757
Sonu is sick. He's not
like the other kids.

682
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:11,761
That l understood when l
saw him. But still l..

683
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,763
lt's not about how he looks Ramji.

684
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,764
Sonu.. can't even swallow his food.

685
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,766
lf l feed him..

686
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:22,769
Sonu! Sonu! Stop! Stop!

687
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,101
Guru! Guru!

688
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:28,236
What will he spit? Till now he must
have digested half of what he has eaten.

689
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:32,315
What was l saying? That if you keep
the plate in front of a hungry kid..

690
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,442
..then he'll finish off everything.

691
00:44:34,518 --> 00:44:36,383
Why, Sonu dear?
Wasn't l saying this?

692
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:38,948
Sonu! - He finished
off his food on his own.

693
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,784
What do you mean he ate his food? - l'd
gone to the kitchen for a minute.

694
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:45,317
Why did you leave him alone? - l'd just
gone to the kitchen for a minute, Guru.

695
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:49,127
What did he eat? - Nothing,
l'd given him pulses and rice.

696
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,794
He finished off everything.
- Who told you to do all this?

697
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:54,062
l thought..
- Guru. - What!

698
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:56,299
He has eaten his food for
the first time on his own.

699
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:59,002
Can you believe it? He's fine.

700
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:03,806
Appu. - ln this house
everyone says Appu only.

701
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:07,214
You're saying Appu, Appu. This naughty
boy too says Appu in the morning.

702
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,808
What's the matter?

703
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:10,820
Because my pet name is Appu.
And this naughty boy doesn't..

704
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,822
..say anything else other than Appu.

705
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,823
Really!
- Appu, Appu. - What?

706
00:45:15,893 --> 00:45:18,157
Better be careful.

707
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:23,300
ls Guru brother annoyed with me?

708
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:26,903
What did you say his name is?
- Ramji.

709
00:45:27,004 --> 00:45:29,837
Ramji. - He says that
he'd got all the papers.

710
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:32,332
He even had the work permit.

711
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:34,838
But a tragedy occurred at the
place where he was going to work. So..

712
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:38,442
After that he lost
his bag in the train.

713
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:39,847
That's why all the papers..

714
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,850
Do you believe him?

715
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:47,248
l don't think he's lying.

716
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:51,923
So Guru do you want to help him?

717
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:56,399
l..
- Guru.

718
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:59,063
He saved Sonu's life.

719
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:04,202
Well.
- Let's see what we can do.

720
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:07,867
Where's your Bihari guy?

721
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:12,882
Why Ramji? What happened?

722
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:17,210
What happened? l
feel like l'm in heaven.

723
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:19,355
ls this place a kitchen or a palace?

724
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:21,288
lt's as clean as a knife.

725
00:46:21,392 --> 00:46:22,882
l can't see any coal here.

726
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,894
Did you like it?
- Sister, not good, not good.

727
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:30,491
Very good. lt feels
as if l'm at home.

728
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:34,428
Very good. Guru and l are
outside in the restaurant.

729
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:35,972
These people will tell
you about your work.

730
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:38,075
Brother, where's the stove?

731
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:41,244
This is the microwave. Keep the food
inside, put the timer, press the button.

732
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:42,904
Okay, this is easy.

733
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,381
And this is the big oven. You can keep
many things inside it at the same time.

734
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,917
l've seen this once before.

735
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:53,917
Are you cooking gourd?

736
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,388
What happened? Why are you
putting so much of soda?

737
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,122
Stomach will get upset.

738
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,928
Grind some garlic and put in it.
lt will taste more delicious.

739
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:05,932
Did l ask you?

740
00:47:06,103 --> 00:47:07,934
Why are you getting annoyed?
l'm just telling you.

741
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:09,936
Don't interfere in my work.

742
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:11,404
l'm not interfering in your work.

743
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:13,409
l'm just showing you the
right way to cook it. Try it once.

744
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:15,942
Do you know more than me?

745
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:17,939
Cook it.
- Why are you getting annoyed?

746
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:20,549
No, you only cook it.

747
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:23,143
What is there in it? l'll cook it.
- Yeah, cook.

748
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:24,948
l used to cook everyday.
l'll show it to you. - Cook it.

749
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,348
Take a bit of turmeric.

750
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,484
And.. - Cook it. Why
are you showing it to me?

751
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:32,153
You know better than me, don't you?
- Okay, brother.

752
00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:33,958
What's so tough in it?
Brother, quickly get some..

753
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,965
..grinded garlic.
- l can't do this any longer.

754
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,962
Today l'll give you a
glimpse of the Goddess of taste.

755
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:43,170
What happened, Ramji?
- What happened?

756
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,309
Uncle told me to show him cooking.

757
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,971
So l thought to give
him a taste of Takipur.

758
00:47:49,146 --> 00:47:52,047
You too taste it.

759
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:54,977
Have it. Do have it.

760
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:07,160
What happened?
What happened, sister?

761
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:10,333
One minute, wait here only.

762
00:48:13,504 --> 00:48:16,337
lt's not education.. - Come here
soon. - What is so great about food?

763
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:19,467
Taste this. Just taste this.

764
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,410
Taste this now.
- Okay. - Greetings.

765
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:24,413
Are you Guru brother's friend?
You too taste it.

766
00:48:24,515 --> 00:48:27,075
Jai, come on, taste this.
- Thank you.

767
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:32,417
lsn't it great?
- You prepared all this?

768
00:48:32,523 --> 00:48:36,186
Not only this, l even know how
to make different types of snacks.

769
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:40,363
l even cook Gujarati,
Marathi and Madrasi food.

770
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:43,295
l even cook dosa,
uttapas and golgapas.

771
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:47,029
l even cook sweets without sugar.

772
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:50,173
Hey, brother, your
chef is also strange. Why?

773
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,232
He makes chapattis
too in the machine.

774
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:59,048
Sister, look, Sonu is eating food on
his own. - Sonu. - Delicious food, man.

775
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:01,650
Did you see Sonu?

776
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,249
l've never seen him so happy before.

777
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:07,254
He calls Appu, sister.

778
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:10,049
Everyone is happy with him. - Yeah.

779
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:12,392
l think l'll start the paper work.

780
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:17,056
Legally he shouldn't have
any problem in staying here.

781
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:19,395
lt could take time to get the visa.

782
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,401
Okay. - l'll start the
paper work of the embassy.

783
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:25,269
For the time being, if you want you can
keep him at your house as a guest.

784
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:30,242
But without work permit, you know..

785
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:34,246
..no body should know that
he's working in your restaurant.

786
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:36,079
Okay.

787
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:42,252
Till now l've never
done any illegal work.

788
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:47,094
But seeing Sonu's happiness..

789
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:50,260
You know l understand.

790
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,093
l'll see what l can do.

791
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,295
Just see to it that no
one comes to know about it.

792
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:57,101
That he works at your restaurant.

793
00:49:57,274 --> 00:49:59,105
That's it.

794
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:28,597
With fair people.

795
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:34,669
l've formed a bond.

796
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:40,144
The heart of a village guy.

797
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:43,643
Has transformed
into a London heart.

798
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:51,356
London's heart, London,
London's heart, London.

799
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:56,161
London's heart, London,
London's heart, London.

800
00:50:56,333 --> 00:51:01,566
London's heart, London,

00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:08,168

802
00:51:09,446 --> 00:51:14,383
East has met with the west.

803
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:20,683
London's heart, London,
London's heart, London.

804
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,591
London's heart, London,
London's heart, London.

805
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:31,191
The heart of a guy named Ram.

806
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,747
My heart used to
sigh and tattletale.

807
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:59,419
When l left my country for so
many days my heart was not with me.

808
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:03,761
My heart used to
sigh and tattletale.

809
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:09,236
When l left my country for so
many days my heart was not with me.

810
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:13,240
Now it has come, my friend.

811
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:19,444
Now it has come
with me, foreigner.

812
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:22,246
The heart's bell
has started ringing.

813
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:31,658
The heart's bell
has started ringing.

814
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:37,259
Heart.. heart.

815
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:42,796
My heart has
transformed into a London heart.

816
00:53:06,897 --> 00:53:11,300
l've started to like this
quarrel and being practical.

00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:16,296
Every vegetable has
started cooking better.

818
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:21,308
l've started to like this
quarrel and being practical.

819
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:26,306
Every vegetable has
started cooking better.

820
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:30,510
My style.. is melting today.

821
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:35,652
My pulses.. is cooked.

822
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:40,328

Life has become spicier.
Everything is buttery.

00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:55,936
My heart buttery...

The heart of a village guy has

00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:28,375
A bond is formed.

00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:37,911
Has transformed
into a London heart.

832
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:44,592
Guru brother, did you call me?
l've kept the pulses to cook.

833
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:46,387
Wait.

834
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:50,594
Take this. Your first salary.

835
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,802
What are you saying?

836
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:03,810
Guru brother, send this to
my village for my sister.

837
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:05,812
l'll keep this.

838
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:07,747
What will you do with so less money?

839
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:09,943
There is a temple nearby..

840
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,749
..no one takes proper care of it.

841
00:55:11,822 --> 00:55:13,414
l think l'll donate it there.

842
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:16,684
Sonu, Ramji uncle has
got his first salary.

843
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,489
Ask him whether
he'll give us a party.

844
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:21,428
Yes.
- Sonu, dear is like a prince.

845
00:55:21,832 --> 00:55:25,768
With God's grace we can

846
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:27,428
What do you say?
- God.

847
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:35,434
He has started talking.
What did you say?

848
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:38,839
Say it again. What

lt's all because of you.
- O no.

861
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:30,493
This is the grace of God.

862
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:33,895
You've brought
happiness in our lives, Ramji.

863
00:56:34,004 --> 00:56:36,973
No, no, no, sister. This is God's...

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,501
Party, party. This calls for a
party. This calls for a party.

865
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:43,839
Party.

866
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:54,523
Excuse me, darling. l need

867
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,523
Hi, Ramji.
- Hi, hi.

868
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:08,535
Well if some people want to do it
this way, l just don't believe... - Hi.

869
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:10,531
Hey.

870
00:57:12,709 --> 00:57:14,540

871
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:21,540
There are you, Sonu.

Appu, cake. - O my God! O

Amazing! He said cake! Congrats!

877
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:49,572
That's awesome! - lt's God's grace,
Sameera. lt's like a miracle.

878
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:53,579
Yeah. - l know him, another

879
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,049
Hello, Mrs. Malhotra.

00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:12,596
What happened?
- l need salt. lt's less.

883
00:58:12,936 --> 00:58:16,929
Salt is fine. l'd put
less salt in Sonu's food.

884
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:18,770
You must have eaten that food.

885
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:21,804
There was less salt in
my food. And that's it.

886
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:23,607
Can l have the salt, please?

887
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:28,143
Look, if you want more
salt then take it separately.

888
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:30,611
Don't talk rubbish about my food.

889
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:32,812
You're wearing
almost nothing as clothes.

890
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:35,619
Roaming around naked. Am l
saying anything about your clothes?

891
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:37,626
ldiot! How dare you!

892
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:40,629
You're the one who's daring. Take this.
Take as much salt as you want. Go.

893
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:43,629
Talking nonsense about my food.
- llliterate.

894
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,628
Witch!
- Silly! - Cat!

895
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,632

Were you helpless?

902
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:11,650
Was your marriage
fixed in childhood only?

903
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:13,654
Otherwise how you got
stuck with this woman.

904
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,861
Speak softly. She even bites.
- Yes, l saw that.

905
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:24,270
Greetings, do come.

906

l've not seen
Parvati after her marriage.

909
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:37,081
l've got some
'Dahi-Chura' (Curd & Rice-flake).

910
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:38,745
lt's good, it's good.

911
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:41,154
Sir, this watermelon is for you

912
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:44,884
Sir is only worthy of watermelon.

913
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:48,687
Where's son-in-law?

914
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:53,097
He has gone in his scooter, in this heat,
to spread the news of the world.

915
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:57,035
Greetings. Bless you.
- How are you, dear? - l'm fine.

916
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:02,701

Yes, l got the
money that you'd sent.

920
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:18,720
Chutki, can you easily make
a call to London from here?

921
01:00:18,895 --> 01:00:20,726
From brother's side.

922
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:23,195
Talk to Parvati first.

923
01:00:23,266 --> 01:00:25,734
Talk to Ramji.

924
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:27,062
Come.

925
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:33,139

l was delighted.
- How are you?

929
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:42,750
No, no, no. Don't
worry about me. l'm fine.

930
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:45,353
l'm staying with very good people.

931
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:48,084
Really brother! - Yes, they're
very good people. And listen.

932
01:00:48,224 --> 01:00:51,091
You take care of yourself. And
very soon l'll send you more money.

933
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:54,094
Don't send all of it.
Save some for yourself too.

934
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:57,358
And take care of your diet.

935
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:00,932
You remember, don't you?
Father's death anniversary is coming.

936
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,970
l remember everything.

937
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,975
l've called foreign pundit.
l'm meeting him today.

938
01:01:08,178 --> 01:01:09,907
What's the time over there?

939
01:01:10,947 --> 01:01:15,111
lt's almost dawn. Good bye.
- Good bye.

940
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:17,779
Beneath the tap?
What are you saying?

941
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:19,979
l don't want to do
father's death ceremony.

942
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:23,315
As it is, you're looking so modern.

943
01:01:23,393 --> 01:01:24,985
What worship will you do?

944
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:28,062
This cap, jacket, jeans, pants.
- Wait.

945
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:32,795
What happened? - ls this sufficient?

946
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:35,337
Or shall l start chanting mantras?
- Okay, okay.

947
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:39,808
But the death ceremony will be besides
the lake, not underneath the tap. - Ok.

948
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,069
And shall l get the things for the
death ceremony or you'll get it?

949
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:46,138
Not l.. you have to get the things.
l'll only do the worship part.

950
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:53,812
Hello, inspector. Hi.
- Hi.

951
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:55,818
Business is good.

952
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:59,018
Your chef brings in
a big lndian crowd.

953
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:01,824
How would l know?
lt's not my shop, mate.

954
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:04,097
Come, would you like to join me?

955
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,828
Thank you. After you.

956
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:11,838
l'll tell you something. l

957
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:14,342
And 7 of them were lndians.

958
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:18,239
l know, mate. One more
and you'll get promoted.

959
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:21,044
You know quite a bit, mate.

960
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:22,845
l practice law.

961
01:02:24,187 --> 01:02:25,848
Care for a smoke?
- No, thanks.

962
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:30,051
Excuse me. Guru, would you..
- Any problem?

963
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:33,388
He's suspicious. Send Ramji in.

964
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:35,858
Come here in the morning and..
- Ramji.

965
01:02:35,932 --> 01:02:37,866
No need to wear this. Go in.
- Guru.

966
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:39,868
Why?
- Yup, coming.

967
01:02:40,603 --> 01:02:42,867
The policeman has come.
- Yes, l know.

968
01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:48,403

How are you?
- You work here as a chef?

970
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:54,216
Chief? You're the chief?

971
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:56,081
Okay, so l'll say
chief inspector. Okay?

972
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,887
You go in. - What's the
need to stamp on my foot.

973
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:02,024
Will you have something to eat?

974
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:05,894
Do you have papers, mate?
- Paper, yes l have it.

975
01:03:05,962 --> 01:03:10,023
l have paper masala dosa,
mint paper masala dosa..

976
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,897
..and cheese paper masala dosa.
What would you like to have?

977
01:03:12,068 --> 01:03:15,435
No, permit. Work permit paper.

978
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:17,901
He's asking something else only.

979
01:03:18,308 --> 01:03:20,503
Guru brother, what is he talking?

980
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:23,910
He's telling you to shut
your mouth and go from here.

981
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,912
Okay, l'll take your leave.

982
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:30,917
This is Mr. Guru.
He owns this place.

983
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:32,915
Would you like to eat something?

984
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:58,008
Hey! check in the gate.

985
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:00,442
This grill is awesome, man.

986
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:18,966
Hey, what are you doing?

987
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:21,968
???
. . .

988
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:24,472
This is not garbage.
This is a sacred thing.

989
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:26,974
He's doing rituals
for his dead father.

990
01:04:27,143 --> 01:04:29,509
Give me 5 minutes.
l'll finish my rituals.

991
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,479
Ritual? Get the hell out of here.

992
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:33,976
Look there is some trouble there.
- Let's go.

993
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,380
Come. Didn't you see it?

994
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:38,181
What are they saying, pundit-ji?

995
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:40,983
What's the problem?
- What's going on?

996
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:46,322
lt's a free zone. - lt's a respect.
Doing a ritual for his dead father.

997
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:50,159
Now leave him alone.
Now leave him alone.

998
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,324
l told you to leave him alone.

999
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:02,601
Hey, hey, leave him alone.
- You rascal, get away from here!

1000
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:06,543
No manners!
- Ramji, you be seated.

1001
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:08,277
lt's inauspicious to get up
in between from the ritual.

1002
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,218
By doing this ritual, l'm
praying for my father's souls' peace.

1003
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,016
And here they are
spreading violence.

1004
01:05:22,365 --> 01:05:24,560
Police! Forgive me, Ramji.

1005
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:26,363
Hey, pundit-ji, where are you going?

1006
01:05:26,436 --> 01:05:29,030
O pundit-ji! Why are
you running! Listen!

1007
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:30,570
Listen, pundit-ji!

1008
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,040
lt's a great sin not
to complete the ritual.

1009
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:35,441
Sir. - Pundit-ji. - Sir,
you'll have to come with me.

1010
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:37,035
Pundit-ji ran away. l'm not
doing anything wrong.

1011
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:38,205
Sir, sir. You're coming with me, sir.

1012
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:40,044
What are you doing?

1013
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:42,514
ls it a sin in your country
to do father's death ritual?

1014
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:45,383
Leave me. l'm not doing anything
wrong. Where are you taking me?

1015
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:54,057
What happened?

1016
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:57,062
l was sitting by the riverside.

1017
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,124
Slowly shouting my mantras.

1018
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:03,561
Then these white guys, they come,
with their bad legs.

1019
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,073
And they kick my balls.

1020
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:09,074
All five balls.

1021
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:14,245
All my father's.
- What!

1022
01:06:14,617 --> 01:06:16,482
Rice balls. Rice balls.

1023
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:19,077
They kick my balls. The one that
l'd got for the ritual of the dead.

1024
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:21,079
And you interrogate me.

1025
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:25,086
What do you do?
- ls this the time.

1026
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:27,087
What do you do?

1027
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:30,090
Okay, so that is how do you do.

1028
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,436
l do cook. You know
Guru sir's restaurant.

1029
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:37,368
Curry Corner. l cook very good food.

1030
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:41,107
Where's your work permit?

1031
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:48,274
Where's your passport.. and visa.

1032
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:51,116
That is what l'm asking.

1033
01:06:51,454 --> 01:06:55,720
Where's your passport.. and visa.

1034
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:59,617
That is what l'm asking.
- No, no, l ask you. Where?

1035
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:02,323
lt's been so many
days since l lost it.

1036
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:04,127
And you're not even searching for it.

1037
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,462
Write a report. Why are you
looking at my face, you cap.

1038
01:07:05,535 --> 01:07:07,332
lf it had been my village Takipur.

1039
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,131
Then by now we would have
found the thief and made him..

1040
01:07:09,205 --> 01:07:10,604
..roam around naked on the street.

1041
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,402
Come Guru brother and Jai brother.

1042
01:07:12,475 --> 01:07:14,409
He's stupid.

1043
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:16,672
Making him understand is like
making an elephant wear underwear.

1044
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:18,680
What did you say? What did he say?

1045
01:07:18,748 --> 01:07:21,615
Keep quiet, Ramji.
- l'm not afraid of him.

1046
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:24,744
l said that to understand you..

1047
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:27,483
..the elephant wear underwear. Easy.

1048
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:30,355
Where did the elephant come from?

1049
01:07:30,426 --> 01:07:33,361
Officer, l have the
papers for this man's release.

1050
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:35,554
l want this man's
work permit papers..

1051
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:39,362
..his passport and his visa
on my desk tomorrow morning.

1052
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:42,704
Tomorrow morning?
You mean Monday, right?

1053
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:45,899
You don't work weekends.

1054
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:48,341
All right, Monday morning. But they
better be there and in order. - Right.

1055
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:50,707
All right, you can go.

1056
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:54,182
This man is so stupid.

1057
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:57,182
Have you gone mad!

1058
01:07:57,253 --> 01:07:59,244
What was the need to say
that you work in my restaurant!

1059
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:03,180
Guru brother, how was l to know
that l shouldn't say all these things?

1060
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:05,352
That officer was
already suspicious about us.

1061
01:08:06,362 --> 01:08:09,456
Now you'll be in trouble
and get us in trouble too.

1062
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,197
Why will you be in trouble?

1063
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:14,602
When the mistake is mine,
then l'll get the punishment.

1064
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:17,197
What's his crime?

1065
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:19,206
You should have let me
rot in the police station.

1066
01:08:19,275 --> 01:08:21,470
Why did you get me out?
Why did you get me out?

1067
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:26,545
Who told you that you're spared?

1068
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:29,209
You're just out on a bail.

1069
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,548
Whenever they want they
can put you behind bars.

1070
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:35,716
Look, Ramji. Understand one thing.

1071
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:40,219
lf you don't have your visa,
work permit, passport..

1072
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:43,226
..or some identification proof..

1073
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,560
..then you're a
criminal in this country.

1074
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:48,893
And you have nothing
from the mentioned things.

1075
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:50,438
And even l'll be in
trouble for employing such a person.

1076
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:52,770
This is the law.

1077
01:08:54,644 --> 01:08:56,236
Then what do l do now?
- Damn!

1078
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:58,744
You've messed up things, Ramji.
- What he screwed!

1079
01:09:03,653 --> 01:09:06,588
There is only one way to solve
this problem in any country.

1080
01:09:09,425 --> 01:09:11,256
Become the
son-in-law of that country.

1081
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:15,525
Marry a girl from that country.
- Yeah, Jai. Thanks Jai.

1082
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:18,260
But.. l know that.

1083
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:21,599
We're talking about a
practical not a legal thing.

1084
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:24,431
Tomorrow is Saturday.
Then will come Sunday.

1085
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:26,539
We'll have to submit
the papers on Monday.

1086
01:09:26,776 --> 01:09:29,267
And the court will take 30 days.

1087
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:31,470
To give the marriage certificate.

1088
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,811
Okay, assume that in the Penta
court church, we conduct the marriage.

1089
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:38,818
But friend, for
marriage we need a girl.

1090
01:09:38,888 --> 01:09:40,287
lmmediately.

1091
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:42,280
Leave that to me.

1092
01:09:43,626 --> 01:09:45,287
Though you might have
to spend some money.

1093
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:48,290
l'll manage money somehow.

1094
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:50,622
Just get me out of this mess.

1095
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,297
l don't want to lose
everything in this legal problem.

1096
01:09:54,804 --> 01:09:56,294
Just do something.

1097
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:58,305
l'll do something.

1098
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:01,307
How can you tell me to
marry some other person?

1099
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:04,844
Why are you giving it
the name of marriage?

1100
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:07,312
lt's just a technical agreement.

1101
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:09,808
Why do you have to be
so unhappy about it?

1102
01:10:09,986 --> 01:10:14,514
Unhappy? And it makes
no difference to you.

1103
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:17,318
Of course it does,
baby. Of course it does.

1104
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,855
Do you think it's easy for me?

1105
01:10:21,998 --> 01:10:24,933
l was just thinking that
with this small agreement..

1106
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:27,333
..so many people can gain.

1107
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:30,804
Other's gain. What about me?

1108
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:35,343
l'll have to stay with
that illiterate chef.

1109
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:37,879
That illiterate.
- Have you gone mad, Sammy?

1110
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:41,510
Do you think it's easy for me to see
you staying with some other person?

1111
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:44,346
No way, baby. No way.

1112
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:48,349
But l was just thinking.. that
tomorrow you'll marry in the church.

1113
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,952
After that he'll be in his
restaurant and you at your home.

1114
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:54,519
After 3 months, both
of you get divorced.

1115
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:56,531
And then everything
is back to normal.

1116
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:01,534
You make everything
sound so sweet and innocent.

1117
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:06,774
You don't realize, what a
big thing this is for a girl.

1118
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:11,711
l don't know. l don't know anything.

1119
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,445
l've become mad. - Jai.

1120
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,710
Why am l screwing up my
own happiness because..

1121
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:18,049
..l want to do some
good for another person?

1122
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:20,713
Forget it all.

1123
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,791
l just thought.. that Guru and
Appu won't have to go to prison.

1124
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:28,659
Poor Sonu won't be homeless.

1125
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:30,388
That's it.

1126
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:33,398
But forget about it.

1127
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:36,563
lf it's making you uncomfortable..
just let me just forget about it.

1128
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:51,416
You really want me to do this, Jai.

1129
01:11:57,893 --> 01:11:59,417
Not if you're unhappy.

1130
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:02,423
Guru brother, is this a solution!

1131
01:12:02,598 --> 01:12:05,032
lt's different to find a
solution for a problem..

1132
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,035
..and pushing a person in a well.

1133
01:12:07,637 --> 01:12:09,434
How will l answer my villagers?
How will l show them my face?

1134
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:11,630
Nothing will happen, Ramji.

1135
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:13,766
lt's not a real marriage.
lt's a matter of only 3 months.

1136
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:16,968
Real marriage? Then
what is fake marriage?

1137
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:18,843
ls this a play of dolls?

1138
01:12:18,948 --> 01:12:21,439
Look, Guru brother, l don't
understand what you're saying.

1139
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:23,917
Ramji, after 3
months file for a divorce.

1140
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:25,715
After that the girl will be at
her place and you at your place.

1141
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:29,989
Divorce! What new plan are
you scheming? Divorce her.

1142
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:33,786
lt's a great sin. What
will happen to that girl?

1143
01:12:33,963 --> 01:12:35,453
Nothing will happen to her.

1144
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:39,467
She knows everything. Look, for these
arrangements we've spend loads of money.

1145
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,660
That girl knows everything.

1146
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:44,963
She knows everything. The
girl has no qualms about it.

1147
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,802
What a country is this!

1148
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:49,672
She said yes because of money.

1149
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:53,881
lf she refused to divorce me for the
sake of money. Then l'll be stuck.

1150
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:56,951
This will not happen,
Ramji. She's a nice girl.

1151
01:12:57,019 --> 01:12:58,611
She knows me, she knows you.

1152
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:00,485
She is doing this to help us.

1153
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:03,085
She knows me?
- Yes.

1154
01:13:03,492 --> 01:13:05,756
Guru brother, who is this girl?

1155
01:13:06,896 --> 01:13:09,626
Sameera.

1156
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:13,100
Who? Jai brother's fiance?

1157
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:16,101
Yes. - lt means Jai brother's
fiance will now be my fiance.

1158
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:18,902
And after divorce my fiance
will become Jai brother's fiance.

1159
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:21,499
Yes. lt's a wrong thing to keep
changing the fiance again and again.

1160
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:23,636
Look, Ramji, l don't have
the time to argue with you.

1161
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:25,772
Tomorrow you have to go to the
church at 6 o'clock and get married.

1162
01:13:26,982 --> 01:13:29,041
Church? Why will l go to the church?

1163
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,517
lsn't there a temple here?

1164
01:13:31,854 --> 01:13:35,051
Actually.. l forgot to
tell you one thing, Ramji.

1165
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:40,852
For the marriage to take place quickly,
both of you will have to change ..

1166
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,797
..your religion become Catholics and
get married in the church.

1167
01:13:44,934 --> 01:13:47,528
Guru brother, are you joking?

1168
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:49,994
What plans are you
scheming one after the other?

1169
01:13:50,206 --> 01:13:53,141
First you said to marry, then
you said it's a fake wedding.

1170
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:55,541
Then you said to file a divorce and now
you're saying to change my religion.

1171
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:57,537
ls this a joke?

1172
01:13:58,013 --> 01:14:01,141
Look, other things are okay.
But l can't joke with religion.

1173
01:14:02,017 --> 01:14:03,609
l'm a religious person.

1174
01:14:03,953 --> 01:14:06,717
No, l respect other religion too.

1175
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:09,722
Jesus Christ is a
great God. l respect him.

1176
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,756
But how will l answer my God.

1177
01:14:12,061 --> 01:14:13,551
No, l can't do this. You
can say whatever you want.

1178
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:16,154
l'm returning.
- Okay, go.

1179
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:18,558
You want to go, then go.

1180
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:21,559
But understand one thing, Ramji.

1181
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:24,562
l never wanted to help you.

1182
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:30,769
But after you arrived, for the
fist time l saw my family happy.

1183
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:36,579
After our son was born, for the
first time l saw my wife smiling,

1184
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:38,783
l saw my son laughing so much.

1185
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,752
And for his family's happiness,
every person has the right to do..

1186
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,756
..whatever he can do.

1187
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:50,122
And l did a small illegal thing.

1188
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:55,798
You didn't have the right documents with
you. Still l employed you at my place.

1189
01:14:58,007 --> 01:15:00,601
But now the
conditions are such that..

1190
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:04,806
..if you don't help us, Ramji,
then everything will be ruined.

1191
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:09,075
They'll put me and
my wife behind bars.

1192
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:11,085
And separate our son from us, Ramji.

1193
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:15,885
And to evade all this if l
have to beg in front of you..

1194
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,823
No, Guru brother.

1195
01:15:18,794 --> 01:15:21,786
l'm ashamed. l made a big mistake.

1196
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:25,633
Forgive me.

1197
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:29,964
l don't know how l
became so selfish.

1198
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:33,300
l forgot that how
much you've helped me.

1199
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:38,043
l'll do whatever you say.

1200
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:40,640
Make me do whatever you want.

1201
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:45,653
ln the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

1202
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:46,714
Thank you very much, father.

1203
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:52,113
So, you think you've
got around the problem.

1204
01:16:53,122 --> 01:16:54,714
Officer, you've got your job to do.

1205
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,714
And l've got mine.

1206
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,725
Papers on your desk,
tomorrow morning.

1207
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:02,056
Before 9 30.

1208
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:08,253
Yes. May l help you?
- May l come in for a minute?

1209
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:11,322
Please do, certainly. Come in.
- Thank you.

1210
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:15,790
May l speak to Robert, please?

1211
01:17:16,063 --> 01:17:20,329
Robert, who's Robert?
- Your son-in-law.

1212
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:23,195
Which one?

1213
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:26,204
No, no, no. Unless Sameera
has been a naughty girl.

1214
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:28,138
l don't think she's married.

1215
01:17:30,077 --> 01:17:32,807
ln that case, may l
speak to Sameera, please?

1216
01:17:33,147 --> 01:17:34,978
Yeah, she's upstairs.
She'll be down in a minute.

1217
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:38,016
ln the meantime, can l get
you a nice cup of coffee?

1218
01:17:38,085 --> 01:17:40,280
Coffee would be great. Thank you.

1219
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:43,812
One coffee coming up. Who's Robert?
- No one.

1220
01:17:59,006 --> 01:18:00,371
Excuse me, officer. Can l help you?

1221
01:18:00,841 --> 01:18:02,103
What do you think you're doing?

1222
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:03,507
What do you think you're doing?

1223
01:18:04,044 --> 01:18:05,170
What do you mean by that?

1224
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:07,836
How did a nice young lady like you..

1225
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:12,113
..get involved into
something so illegal?

1226
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:14,183
l don't know what you're
talking about, officer.

1227
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:16,253
Are you married to Robert?

1228
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,257
- Yes.

1229
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:31,269
And does he live with you here?
- Yes.

1230
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:34,940
Well, Sameera, your
husband must be quite a man.

1231
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:39,202
Your grandmother has never
seen him. Quite a marriage.

1232
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,041
Look, officer. l don't need to
answer any of your questions.

1233
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:47,219
l suggest you speak
to my fiancee. Lawyer.

1234
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:52,156
lt's very unfortunate that
you got involved in this.

1235
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:56,388
lf charges are brought,
you'll be implicated as well.

1236
01:18:57,231 --> 01:18:58,425
Have a good day.

1237
01:19:01,235 --> 01:19:04,170
Oh, and you better
prepare for some visitors.

1238
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:07,230
Some immigration
officials will be calling..

1239
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:09,571
..around this evening
to verify your marriage.

1240
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:10,974
Thanks for the coffee.

1241
01:19:18,318 --> 01:19:21,116
Two days back l was free.
And now l'm married.

1242
01:19:22,089 --> 01:19:25,183
l got married to a
person whom l don't even know.

1243
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:27,587
And now l'll have to stay with him.

1244
01:19:28,262 --> 01:19:29,923
And on top of it,
l'll have to convince..

1245
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:32,329
..immigration officers
that we really are married.

1246
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:33,923
Otherwise l go to jail.

1247
01:19:35,335 --> 01:19:37,200
ln what a situation have
you got me struck, Jai.

1248
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:39,933
l can't handle it.
- Did someone force you?

1249
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:43,399
You yourself had
decided that we'll help them.

1250
01:19:43,477 --> 01:19:45,945
When we've decided that
we'll help them then..

1251
01:19:46,013 --> 01:19:47,947
..at the last moment you
can't say that l can't handle it.

1252
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,946
We only have to convince
immigration officers..

1253
01:19:52,019 --> 01:19:54,613
..that your marriage is
actually genuine. That's all.

1254
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:56,946
After that everything
goes back to normal.

1255
01:19:57,024 --> 01:19:59,151
Normal!
- Yes, normal. What else?

1256
01:19:59,426 --> 01:20:03,157
l can't understand.
We're in a legal problem.

1257
01:20:03,363 --> 01:20:05,160
And we have no other way out.

1258
01:20:12,573 --> 01:20:15,235
Guru and l really
appreciate what you're doing for us.

1259
01:20:16,243 --> 01:20:20,441
Jai, l'm sorry, but what
if they're not convinced?

1260
01:20:20,514 --> 01:20:24,382
Then we're in a big problem.
We'll handle that later.

1261
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:26,443
Right now it's more important..

1262
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,987
..to take Ramji to Sameera's house.

1263
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:29,986
Before the immigration
officers reach there.

1264
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,181
lf we get stuck in the traffic,
then we'll be in a mess.

1265
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,321
Oh, Appu, please
quickly pack Ramji's things.

1266
01:20:42,169 --> 01:20:44,000
Granny! Granny!

1267
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:46,463
With whom are you
talking to, in a closed house?

1268
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,007
What? - Please don't ask me
anything. l'll tell you later.

1269
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:50,541
Such strange customs..
- He'll stay with us for a few days.

1270
01:20:51,178 --> 01:20:53,203
Did she lock you in
the house and go away?

1271
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:54,405
So strange!

1272
01:20:54,514 --> 01:20:57,540
ln our Takipur, mischievous
kids are locked in this manner.

1273
01:20:58,352 --> 01:21:02,413
Did you do any naughty thing?
- Who are you?

1274
01:21:02,623 --> 01:21:06,081
My name is Ramji.
No, my name is Robert.

1275
01:21:06,293 --> 01:21:07,487
lt got changed yesterday only.

1276
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:10,029
Give me your blessings. And you?

1277
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:13,566
Only grandmother.
Granny is English name.

1278
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:16,035
lt is done? Okay,
Ramji you go up and..

1279
01:21:16,103 --> 01:21:17,229
No, Robert.

1280
01:21:17,304 --> 01:21:19,033
Okay, Robert you go upstairs and..

1281
01:21:19,106 --> 01:21:21,040
..put your clothes in
the cupboard. Be ready.

1282
01:21:21,308 --> 01:21:22,639
lmmigration officers must
be coming at any moment now.

1283
01:21:23,043 --> 01:21:25,637
Doctor has told you not to
eat sweet stuff. Spit it out.

1284
01:21:25,712 --> 01:21:27,043
You're a naughty grandmother.

1285
01:21:27,114 --> 01:21:28,376
Spit. They've come.
- Who?

1286
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:30,507
lmmigration officers. They're
parking their car. Hurry up.

1287
01:21:30,584 --> 01:21:32,518
But l've still not
changed my clothes.

1288
01:21:32,586 --> 01:21:33,644
Hurry up. Change your clothes later.

1289
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,654
l feel embarrassed. At
least let me dress up properly.

1290
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:40,056
Okay, take this. Put your legs up.

1291
01:21:40,227 --> 01:21:41,660
Relax properly. Read the paper.

1292
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:45,062
ln a relaxed manner
call me to open the door.

1293
01:21:45,232 --> 01:21:48,065
Sameera-ji, open the door.
- Loudly.

1294
01:21:48,235 --> 01:21:50,135
What difference does it make
whether l speak loudly or not?

1295
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:52,137
You want to open
the door, then do it.

1296
01:21:52,472 --> 01:21:54,599
l'll kill you. Do as l say.

1297
01:21:54,675 --> 01:21:57,405
Say loudly, coming.
Darling, open the door.

1298
01:21:57,577 --> 01:22:01,069
Okay coming, darling, open the door.

1299
01:22:02,249 --> 01:22:04,080
O God, help me!
- Now what happened?

1300
01:22:05,252 --> 01:22:07,083
One more thing. Put
this ring, quickly.

1301
01:22:09,256 --> 01:22:10,484
Granny, l'll open it.

1302
01:22:12,092 --> 01:22:15,084
Hello.
- We're from the immigration office.

1303
01:22:15,162 --> 01:22:19,496
Oh, darling,
immigration officers have come.

1304
01:22:19,599 --> 01:22:21,294
They want to investigate something.

1305
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:25,164
He's just so tired. He has
got back from work right now.

1306
01:22:25,238 --> 01:22:26,296
l understand.

1307
01:22:26,373 --> 01:22:27,431
l'm sorry. Can l see
him for a few minutes?

1308
01:22:27,507 --> 01:22:29,634
Sure. Please come in.
- Thank you. After you.

1309
01:22:31,178 --> 01:22:33,112
Honey, immigration officers.
- Thank you.

1310
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:37,650
Greetings, Bishambar Mehra.

1311
01:22:37,718 --> 01:22:40,118
Greetings, Ramji.. dhat, Robert.

1312
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:44,790
Dhat Robert? But in this
it's written only Robert.

1313
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:46,325
Yeah, it's Robert. Have a seat.

1314
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,325
Please be seated.
- Okay.

1315
01:22:51,465 --> 01:22:53,660
Congratulations on your wedding.
- Congratulations.

1316
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:55,133
Thank you.

1317
01:22:57,804 --> 01:23:00,329
Mr. Robert, you
were a chef in lndia?

1318
01:23:00,607 --> 01:23:03,405
What? - You were a chef
in lndia, weren't you?

1319
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:04,808
Yes, cook.

1320
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:09,311
And you studied up to the year 8th?
- Yes, 8th pass.

1321
01:23:11,151 --> 01:23:15,815
But why? ln my village
only up to 8th class.

1322
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:19,152
Plus two means you go to town.

1323
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:22,318
My father said, no,
you don't go to town.

1324
01:23:22,429 --> 01:23:24,420
You go to town means you drink bidi.

1325
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:30,560
Bidi? - Bidi, bidi. You know
cigarettes. Younger brother.

1326
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:33,704
Brown younger brother also.

1327
01:23:34,508 --> 01:23:35,634
Okay, tell me one thing.

1328
01:23:36,643 --> 01:23:38,338
You're less educated than your wife.

1329
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:42,575
So how did the two
of you get together?

1330
01:23:43,517 --> 01:23:45,382
Love is blind, you know.

1331
01:23:45,519 --> 01:23:48,181
Yes, and no doctor
for this blind also.

1332
01:23:48,388 --> 01:23:51,380
Yes, that is fine. But
tell me how did you meet?

1333
01:23:55,529 --> 01:24:03,197
You say, honey.
- You only tell them.. honey.

1334
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:10,872
lt was an accident.
- Oh, an accident.

1335
01:24:11,378 --> 01:24:13,812
Can you tell us more briefly
how did this accident happen?

1336
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,814
And when it happened?
- No. - No!

1337
01:24:17,617 --> 01:24:20,677
The case is still in the court..
we can't talk about that.

1338
01:24:21,388 --> 01:24:22,480
l handled the situation.

1339
01:24:27,561 --> 01:24:30,394
Darling.
- Oh, that one.

1340
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:33,394
Coming, darling, open the door.

1341
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:37,766
Was it okay? What happened?

1342
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:41,401
The phone is ringing.
- The phone is ringing?

1343
01:24:41,575 --> 01:24:43,839
Both the phones have
the same ring tones.

1344
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:45,710
So l get confused.
- Excuse me.

1345
01:24:48,415 --> 01:24:49,643
Hello. Jai.

1346
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:57,850
Where's the bathroom?
- What?

1347
01:24:59,793 --> 01:25:02,591
Where's the bathroom?
- Why?

1348
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:07,266
l want to play football.
l want to go to the loo.

1349
01:25:07,434 --> 01:25:12,531
Yes, you shouldn't try to
stop it. lt's there. - Where?

1350
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:15,536
Come, l'll show you.
- Okay.

1351
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:25,274
Bathroom is here.
- Thank you. Here!

1352
01:25:25,452 --> 01:25:27,283
We were going to
construct it here but..

1353
01:25:27,354 --> 01:25:30,812
..because of Vaastu
everything got messed up.

1354
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:34,292
And we thought we'll
have the bathroom here..

1355
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:38,821
..but this is so big, so
we couldn't built it here.

1356
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:44,299
So we thought why not
built the bathroom here.

1357
01:25:46,573 --> 01:25:47,767
Go. Even l want to use the loo.

1358
01:25:48,909 --> 01:25:50,843
Now l don't want to go.
- Why?

1359
01:25:50,911 --> 01:25:53,311
Just like that.
- Okay, so l'll go.

1360
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,641
When l've found it, then
it's better to use it.

1361
01:25:58,652 --> 01:26:00,916
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- No problem.

1362
01:26:04,724 --> 01:26:08,785
Look, our duty is to stop
illegal wedding in this country.

1363
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:10,328
And we came here because..

1364
01:26:10,397 --> 01:26:11,864
..we got a complaint against you.

1365
01:26:12,499 --> 01:26:14,330
And looking at this
house's atmosphere..

1366
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:16,335
..it seems this complaint
could be true to a certain extend.

1367
01:26:16,403 --> 01:26:17,734
Anyway, after two weeks..

1368
01:26:17,804 --> 01:26:19,396
..come to our office
for the interview.

1369
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,935
And l hope your marriage is genuine.

1370
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:28,339
And yes, please come
prepared this time.

1371
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:38,522
Sameera, try and understand, baby.

1372
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:42,760
There are still 14 days left.
We can fix this thing.

1373
01:26:44,764 --> 01:26:48,427
How will you fix it, Jai?
That too with that illiterate.

1374
01:26:48,768 --> 01:26:51,828
You know it's difficult.
- What's so difficult?

1375
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:54,839
We just have to create a
small love story. That's it.

1376
01:26:56,776 --> 01:26:59,040
What do you think?
They'll accept it.

1377
01:26:59,713 --> 01:27:02,910
Already they doubt us.
They've come to our house.

1378
01:27:02,983 --> 01:27:04,382
They're keeping a watch over us.

1379
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:06,385
And you're saying we can do it.

1380
01:27:08,855 --> 01:27:11,722
Sammy, please try
and understand, baby.

1381
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:14,552
We just have to create a love story.

1382
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:18,857
Okay, let's make a love story.

1383
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:21,395
A love story that's so simple..

1384
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:22,935
..that even that
illiterate understands it.

1385
01:27:23,003 --> 01:27:25,062
And he says exactly what l tell him.

1386
01:27:25,672 --> 01:27:26,866
Can you make such a love story?

1387
01:27:30,744 --> 01:27:35,738
Hey, l've got a great idea.
We'll tell them our love story.

1388
01:27:35,915 --> 01:27:39,407
The only difference is that..
you put him in my place.

1389
01:27:40,754 --> 01:27:44,588
Our love story? - Yeah.
What can be simpler than that?

1390
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:55,428
Sameera-ji, forgive me.

1391
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:57,431
But if we go to the
officers with this story..

1392
01:27:57,504 --> 01:27:59,904
..then they'll
immediately arrest us.

1393
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:04,434
Why? - Look, just now
you said that the lawyers..

1394
01:28:04,511 --> 01:28:08,845
..charge 20 pounds an
hour to solve your problem.

1395
01:28:09,616 --> 01:28:12,779
That's fine. ln the
beginning they used to meet at home.

1396
01:28:12,952 --> 01:28:19,448
Then they started meeting in
restaurants, cinemas, parks.

1397
01:28:19,726 --> 01:28:22,456
And their love story
progressed gradually.

1398
01:28:22,796 --> 01:28:26,129
But lawyers' meter was on each hour.

1399
01:28:26,733 --> 01:28:29,463
What happened is that
for falling in love..

1400
01:28:29,536 --> 01:28:32,130
..lawyer was charging money.

1401
01:28:32,539 --> 01:28:34,473
The person who
charges so much money..

1402
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:37,066
..he'll surely talk
about love and not hatred.

1403
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:41,637
Look, Sameera-ji, your
love story might be true.

1404
01:28:41,881 --> 01:28:43,473
But no one will believe it.

1405
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,811
We'll think about
some other love story.

1406
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:13,710
O God! O God, the floor is wet!

1407
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:20,513
What is this! God!

1408
01:29:31,798 --> 01:29:32,856
What the hell!

1409
01:29:34,934 --> 01:29:37,061
Ramji! Granny!

1410
01:29:37,704 --> 01:29:39,069
What happened?
- What happened?

1411
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:40,731
Why are you shouting?
- Why shouldn't l shout?

1412
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,737
What is this flag like
thing in my bathroom?

1413
01:29:47,947 --> 01:29:51,883
What is this?
- lt's my undergarments.

1414
01:29:53,153 --> 01:29:54,950
Can't you wear one of a man's size?

1415
01:29:56,823 --> 01:29:59,553
And granny look, the
floor is full of water.

1416
01:29:59,759 --> 01:30:01,750
Bathroom is the only
place where you find water.

1417
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:05,757
And where else do l dry my
undergarments? Here only.

1418
01:30:05,965 --> 01:30:07,023
lf l dry it outside the window..

1419
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,567
..then even more
flag will be hoisted.

1420
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:09,761
Am l right?

1421
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:13,734
l can't handle you
any more. Just go.

1422
01:30:14,641 --> 01:30:16,131
Jai, l really can't handle this man.

1423
01:30:16,209 --> 01:30:19,178
l simply can't live
with him. He's an animal.

1424
01:30:19,245 --> 01:30:21,110
He's ruined my whole house.

1425
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:24,575
Calm down, calm down.
But, what happened?

1426
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:25,843
What happened!

1427
01:30:25,919 --> 01:30:28,114
His one underwear is
bigger than my window's curtain.

1428
01:30:28,188 --> 01:30:30,053
And you know what. Every
time l go to the bathroom..

1429
01:30:30,123 --> 01:30:32,057
..his big underwear is
right in front of me.

1430
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:35,185
Jai, l don't care. And you
have to do something about it.

1431
01:30:35,762 --> 01:30:37,593
Where did it go?
- l have to rush now, okay. Bye.

1432
01:30:37,664 --> 01:30:38,995
Good morning.
- Good morning, granny.

1433
01:30:39,065 --> 01:30:40,123
lt was here only.
- Dear, have your breakfast.

1434
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,668
l don't want it. l'm getting late.
l'm leaving. Love you.

1435
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:46,136
Money all the time.
- Here it is.

1436
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,875
Where's Sameera-ji's bag?
- She left.

1437
01:30:49,943 --> 01:30:51,604
She left?
- Yes.

1438
01:30:52,011 --> 01:30:54,605
l'd kept a bottle of juice in
her bag. l'd gone to take the cap.

1439
01:30:55,148 --> 01:30:56,740
Cap!
- Yes.

1440
01:30:59,018 --> 01:31:00,679
Why did you keep the
juice bottle in my bag?

1441
01:31:00,954 --> 01:31:03,616
Sameera-ji, everyday you leave
without eating your breakfast.

1442
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:05,018
You might get
ulcer in your stomach..

1443
01:31:05,091 --> 01:31:06,149
..if you don't eat
anything for 6-8 hours.

1444
01:31:06,226 --> 01:31:08,956
Who told you to do all this?
l'd told you to do it?

1445
01:31:09,128 --> 01:31:12,291
Mind your business. You're a guest.
So behave like one.

1446
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:16,829
Granny, make him understand,
otherwise.. idiot!

1447
01:31:17,904 --> 01:31:19,633
What such big mistake l did?

1448
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:21,802
l was doing it for her sake only.

1449
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:25,974
Dear, the people in this
country are very independent.

1450
01:31:27,113 --> 01:31:29,047
They want to take
care of themselves.

1451
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:32,117
And if some other person
tries to take care of them..

1452
01:31:32,185 --> 01:31:33,812
..they become worried.

1453
01:31:34,053 --> 01:31:37,181
And doubt them.
Sameera too is like them.

1454
01:31:38,992 --> 01:31:42,155
But you're finished.

1455
01:31:44,063 --> 01:31:47,829
You're trying to frighten me.
- No, l'm just informing you.

1456
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:51,833
Sometimes in anger she
scratches with her nails too.

1457
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,068
You're a naughty grandmother.

1458
01:31:55,174 --> 01:31:57,199
That's why she locks you
in the house and goes.

1459
01:31:58,845 --> 01:32:00,210
Tell me of a way to pacify her.

1460
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,679
Or you'll continue frightening me.

1461
01:32:02,015 --> 01:32:07,009
There's a way. But why do l
tell you? What will l get?

1462
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,023
Will you eat this sweet?
You like it, don't you?

1463
01:32:12,091 --> 01:32:17,859
lt's futile. l can't eat it.
Doctor has told me not to have it.

1464
01:32:19,098 --> 01:32:23,865
No problem. This is sugarless.
You can surely eat it.

1465
01:32:24,103 --> 01:32:29,700
At least taste it. Eat it.

1466
01:32:33,313 --> 01:32:36,248
Did you like it?
- lt's delicious. Give it to me.

1467
01:32:36,316 --> 01:32:38,250
Now you've learned your lesson.

1468
01:32:38,318 --> 01:32:39,717
First tell me of a
method to pacify her..

1469
01:32:39,786 --> 01:32:41,720
..then l'll give it to you.

1470
01:32:41,988 --> 01:32:46,982
There is magic in your hands.
And you're asking me.

1471
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:51,995
Tonight prepare her
favourite food. She'll be pleased.

1472
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:57,727
Especially fish.
- Fish! But l'm a vegetarian.

1473
01:33:03,343 --> 01:33:06,801
What are you staring?
You'll have to touch it.

1474
01:33:06,913 --> 01:33:09,746
Catch it, catch it, catch it.
- No, no, grandma, no grandma.

1475
01:33:13,086 --> 01:33:15,748
Jackets, stacks of shirts.
- Where are you taking me?

1476
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:18,747
Socks, ties.
- l don't want to buy anything.

1477
01:33:18,825 --> 01:33:19,951
Wait here, wait.

1478
01:33:22,161 --> 01:33:26,291
What is this? - Ramji, try
to understand one thing.

1479
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:29,026
You've left your village
and come to live in London.

1480
01:33:29,168 --> 01:33:31,762
Learn to live like a London person.

1481
01:33:31,838 --> 01:33:34,932
Stop wearing curtain underwear.

1482
01:33:37,944 --> 01:33:45,180
Look, l can't wear this.
This is for ladies.

1483
01:33:46,185 --> 01:33:48,312
This is not for ladies.

1484
01:33:48,388 --> 01:33:50,788
ln London everyone
wears this only. See this.

1485
01:33:50,957 --> 01:33:52,515
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1486
01:34:01,134 --> 01:34:02,795
Wow!

1487
01:34:04,303 --> 01:34:05,793
Sameera-ji, l'm sorry for
what happened in the morning.

1488
01:34:06,272 --> 01:34:08,797
Come and have dinner.

1489
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:12,333
l'm not hungry. - Listen, l've
cooked special food for you.

1490
01:34:12,412 --> 01:34:14,812
l told you, l'm not hungry.

1491
01:34:14,981 --> 01:34:17,347
Dear, have a bite.

1492
01:34:18,151 --> 01:34:19,812
For your sake, today Ramji has..

1493
01:34:19,886 --> 01:34:22,013
..touched non-veg for
the first time in his life.

1494
01:34:22,088 --> 01:34:24,022
l've already eaten my dinner.
l'm not hungry.

1495
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:25,148
And please, don't force me.

1496
01:34:26,225 --> 01:34:30,218
Sameera, have a bite.
Even he has not eaten.

1497
01:34:30,363 --> 01:34:34,299
l'd told him not to eat? l'd
told him to prepare all this?

1498
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:36,832
Then? What is this new drama?

1499
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:39,229
Whenever a person wants,
he can have his food.

1500
01:34:39,338 --> 01:34:40,999
No need to wait for anyone.

1501
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:44,841
lt's only for 2 weeks. A
new drama every time. God!

1502
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:02,851
My room so neat and tidy.
Can't be granny.

1503
01:35:16,876 --> 01:35:19,208
Yes, l've reached.
- How did you know it's my call?

1504
01:35:19,412 --> 01:35:21,346
Who else can it be apart from you?

1505
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:24,279
Do you know, what is happening here?

1506
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:26,476
ls that villager
drying his underwear?

1507
01:35:27,053 --> 01:35:29,146
Tell me one thing.
- Yes.

1508
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:32,052
Have you ever waited
for me during meal time?

1509
01:35:33,226 --> 01:35:35,091
Have you ever made a
cup of tea for me?

1510
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:36,889
What has happened to you suddenly?

1511
01:35:37,296 --> 01:35:40,891
Candles are burning.
The room is spick and span.

1512
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:44,092
Dinner is ready. He's
proving to be an ideal husband.

1513
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:46,429
Learn something from Ramji.

1514
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:49,373
ldeal husband? Hey, hang on.

1515
01:35:49,442 --> 01:35:52,104
Are you trying to make
me feel jealous? - Maybe.

1516
01:35:53,513 --> 01:35:56,175
l'm just trying to tell you
l'm impressed. - lmpressed?

1517
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,912
The foolish thing is
that l've told them..

1518
01:35:59,986 --> 01:36:02,386
..that l've already
had my dinner with you.

1519
01:36:02,455 --> 01:36:06,118
And the truth is l'm really hungry.
- Then eat it.

1520
01:36:06,325 --> 01:36:08,919
l'll think about that.
- l'll see you in the morning, love.

1521
01:36:08,995 --> 01:36:10,121
Bye.
- Bye.

1522
01:36:36,956 --> 01:36:40,483
lsn't it good?
- Granny, what are you doing here?

1523
01:36:44,463 --> 01:36:47,955
Actually, l'm sorry. l'd lied.
l had not eaten my dinner.

1524
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:50,235
He cooks such scrumptious meals.

1525
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:57,307
What are you eating?
- Sweet.

1526
01:36:57,476 --> 01:37:02,641
What! Sweet. Doctor has
told you not to eat it.

1527
01:37:03,249 --> 01:37:11,657
lt's sugarless. He cooks good
health food too. - That is true.

1528
01:37:12,992 --> 01:37:15,392
But l've never eaten such
mouth-watering fish before.

1529
01:37:15,461 --> 01:37:18,988
Really! - He's illiterate.
But he cooks great food.

1530
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:27,999
Thank you. l heard everything.

1531
01:37:29,408 --> 01:37:32,002
lf you liked the food,
then you should have told me.

1532
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:37,012
lf l have your permission,
then l'll also eat.

1533
01:37:40,019 --> 01:37:42,010
l'm feeling dizzy because of hunger.

1534
01:37:50,429 --> 01:37:53,557
O God! What things you
people are making me do!

1535
01:37:59,305 --> 01:38:02,035
Such a big difference.

1536
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:05,569
lt's so tight that after
wearing it, l'll peel it to remove.

1537
01:38:06,646 --> 01:38:08,238
Where is that Ramji?

1538
01:38:08,447 --> 01:38:10,438
He has still not
brought the sandwiches.

1539
01:38:11,517 --> 01:38:15,578
Granny, he's not a servant.
- l know he's your husband.

1540
01:38:16,555 --> 01:38:19,046
That's why l'm making him serve me.

1541
01:38:19,225 --> 01:38:21,216
You won't listen. Forget it.

1542
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:25,658
What do l do? He doesn't listen.
He loves cooking.

1543
01:38:26,232 --> 01:38:28,063
Yeah, cooking.

1544
01:38:28,234 --> 01:38:30,668
You know what. Ritz hotel
has opened a new restaurant.

1545
01:38:30,736 --> 01:38:32,727
For which they've even
organized a competition.

1546
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:35,673
lf you say then we'll
sent his recipe of sweet.

1547
01:38:35,741 --> 01:38:38,073
Surely. Good idea.

1548
01:38:40,346 --> 01:38:42,075
What happened, Ramji?
Why are you standing there?

1549
01:38:45,251 --> 01:38:46,411
Hello.

1550
01:38:47,253 --> 01:38:48,743
What happened? Why are
you walking in this manner?

1551
01:38:48,821 --> 01:38:50,083
Nothing.

1552
01:38:50,489 --> 01:38:53,083
What happened, Ramji?
- l can't tell you about it.

1553
01:38:53,559 --> 01:38:55,618
Tell me, what happened?
Are you all right?

1554
01:38:55,695 --> 01:38:57,754
Yes, everything is all right.
- One minute, Ramji. - No.

1555
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:59,422
At least tell me.
- No.

1556
01:39:00,499 --> 01:39:02,262
At least you don't ask me.

1557
01:39:03,369 --> 01:39:05,098
Because of you, Jai has purchased..

1558
01:39:05,171 --> 01:39:07,105
..such a thing for me,
wearing which l feel as if..

1559
01:39:07,173 --> 01:39:09,107
..a particular part of
my body is stuck in marsh.

1560
01:39:12,278 --> 01:39:13,643
Yes, laugh.

1561
01:39:13,713 --> 01:39:15,112
lt is stuck to my waist so tightly..

1562
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:17,513
..that a design is
formed at that place.

1563
01:39:18,517 --> 01:39:20,576
Yes, laugh. What can l do?

1564
01:39:24,657 --> 01:39:26,124
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1565
01:39:26,192 --> 01:39:27,716
Do l catch a bus
for Benzer from here?

1566
01:39:29,528 --> 01:39:32,122
A3.
- A3, okay.

1567
01:39:32,465 --> 01:39:35,127
Are you new to London?
- New? Yes.

1568
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:41,302
Do you live here?
- Yeah, l live here close by.

1569
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:45,408
Where do you live?
- l also stay near by only.

1570
01:39:45,544 --> 01:39:48,138
Do you know Sameera-ji?

1571
01:39:48,314 --> 01:39:51,613
Sameera.. that hotie
from the travel agency.

1572
01:39:53,652 --> 01:39:57,611
l don't know about that.
But she's the fiancee of Jai.

1573
01:39:58,324 --> 01:40:01,157
Ajay. - Ajay, lawyer.
They're very nice people.

1574
01:40:01,327 --> 01:40:03,488
Jai Kapoor?
- Yes.

1575
01:40:03,696 --> 01:40:05,357
What did you say is the girl's name?

1576
01:40:05,631 --> 01:40:07,656
Sameera. Do you know her?

1577
01:40:07,767 --> 01:40:10,634
No. Just tell her to
be cautious of Jai.

1578
01:40:12,638 --> 01:40:15,664
To be cautious from Jai.
What do you mean?

1579
01:40:16,575 --> 01:40:19,635
Do you know Jai? He's a nice man.

1580
01:40:21,347 --> 01:40:24,180
He's a nice man that's
why for the past 4 years..

1581
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:26,184
..he hasn't seen his son's face.

1582
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:32,457
Son's face? No, you're mistaken.

1583
01:40:32,691 --> 01:40:35,353
This is some other Jai.
He's not even married.

1584
01:40:35,528 --> 01:40:42,457
Jai Kapoor. Lawyer. l know
him very well. l'm his ex-wife.

1585
01:41:33,586 --> 01:41:36,749
He's a beast, a monster.
- l'm telling you.

1586
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:40,458
He has a 4-year-old son.
Whom he has not even seen.

1587
01:41:40,659 --> 01:41:45,255
Ramji, look.. - He cheated her.
He married her for money.

1588
01:41:45,331 --> 01:41:46,662
And when the money got over..

1589
01:41:46,732 --> 01:41:48,256
..he abandoned the
mother and the child.

1590
01:41:48,767 --> 01:41:51,668
l'm telling you. This is what
he'll do with Sameera-ji too.

1591
01:41:51,804 --> 01:41:54,671
That is their personal matter.
No need for you to interfere.

1592
01:41:54,807 --> 01:41:56,866
And as it is, he has helped you.

1593
01:41:56,942 --> 01:41:59,740
Help. What help? He took
money for whatever he did.

1594
01:41:59,812 --> 01:42:01,279
You don't call this help.

1595
01:42:01,547 --> 01:42:04,277
And l'm sure the money that
you gave Sameera-ji from..

1596
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:06,818
..that he must have given not
a single penny to Sameera-ji.

1597
01:42:06,886 --> 01:42:08,615
Whatever kind of a
person he is, whatever he is..

1598
01:42:08,687 --> 01:42:10,279
..you mind your own business.

1599
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:12,281
You're not the real husband.

1600
01:42:12,691 --> 01:42:14,818
This marriage is just
to save you. Understood?

1601
01:42:14,894 --> 01:42:17,294
l know that l'm not the real
husband. l know it very well.

1602
01:42:17,463 --> 01:42:19,624
But what do you want?
That l just sit idle.

1603
01:42:19,698 --> 01:42:21,290
Ramji!

1604
01:42:25,638 --> 01:42:29,768
Hello. Curry Corner.
Just a minute. Take it.

1605
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,473
Hello. Father.
- Excuse me, sir. - What?

1606
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,572
How are you?

1607
01:42:35,648 --> 01:42:38,845
Congratulations.
l've heard great news.

1608
01:42:39,652 --> 01:42:43,588
l've heard that you've got married.

1609
01:42:43,656 --> 01:42:47,319
What do you think about
your sister's marriage?

1610
01:42:47,493 --> 01:42:50,860
Father, forgive me. l was in a mess.

1611
01:42:51,797 --> 01:42:53,856
Due to legal procedures,
my money was spend..

1612
01:42:53,999 --> 01:42:56,729
Look, Ramji. Make
the arrangements soon.

1613
01:42:56,802 --> 01:42:58,326
lt will be good for everyone.

1614
01:42:58,404 --> 01:43:00,338
Father.. father..

1615
01:43:03,676 --> 01:43:04,870
Honey, l've got work tomorrow.

1616
01:43:04,944 --> 01:43:07,344
Come on, Sam. Even l've
got to go in the morning.

1617
01:43:07,413 --> 01:43:10,610
Baby, come on. You need to listen..
- No. please, just go.

1618
01:43:10,816 --> 01:43:13,944
Get out. Didn't you
hear what she said? Leave.

1619
01:43:14,687 --> 01:43:17,884
Oh. - Get out. The
door is there. - Ramji!

1620
01:43:17,957 --> 01:43:19,356
Understand on your own,
otherwise l know very well..

1621
01:43:19,425 --> 01:43:20,619
..how to make you understand.

1622
01:43:20,693 --> 01:43:22,354
What happened? Are you drunk?

1623
01:43:23,629 --> 01:43:24,891
l'm not drunk but l know very well..

1624
01:43:24,964 --> 01:43:26,431
..how to bring a drunk
person to his senses.

1625
01:43:26,498 --> 01:43:27,829
Get out.
- Ramji!

1626
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,367
You stay out of this, Sameera-ji.

1627
01:43:29,435 --> 01:43:31,369
Who are you to throw
me out of the house?

1628
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:35,973
Her husband.
- Husband. Fake husband.

1629
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:38,373
l know very well who's
real and who's fake.

1630
01:43:38,544 --> 01:43:39,704
You get out.
- Stop it, Ramji.

1631
01:43:39,778 --> 01:43:41,370
Get out. And don't you
dare come here again.

1632
01:43:41,547 --> 01:43:42,980
l'll teach you a
nice lesson. Understood.

1633
01:43:43,115 --> 01:43:45,049
Hey, how..
- Leave it.

1634
01:43:45,651 --> 01:43:47,710
l don't know the
ways of your country.

1635
01:43:47,853 --> 01:43:49,912
But in our country,
we respect women.

1636
01:43:50,055 --> 01:43:51,579
We call them Goddess.

1637
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:54,987
And we beat the person who
betrays them in front of us.

1638
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,392
Hey you, what do you
think of yourself?

1639
01:44:07,673 --> 01:44:09,732
Smart. Very smart. l'm sorry.

1640
01:44:09,908 --> 01:44:11,739
l shouldn't have come in
between husband and wife.

1641
01:44:12,811 --> 01:44:16,008
Sorry. Good thinking, Ramji.
Good thinking.

1642
01:44:16,482 --> 01:44:17,676
ls he mad?

1643
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,628
Get out! Get out
right now! How dare you!

1644
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:37,766
You know who he is?
He's my fiance. And you..

1645
01:44:38,604 --> 01:44:39,696
Look, Sameera-ji.

1646
01:44:39,838 --> 01:44:41,635
What l was trying to
tell you about Jai is that..

1647
01:44:41,707 --> 01:44:44,767
About Jai. You'll tell me about Jai.

1648
01:44:44,977 --> 01:44:47,445
Tell me. What do you want to say?

1649
01:44:48,847 --> 01:44:51,441
What do you know about
Jai that l don't know?

1650
01:44:52,785 --> 01:44:54,446
l know him from the past 4 years.

1651
01:44:54,653 --> 01:44:57,451
And you from the past 4 weeks.

1652
01:44:58,857 --> 01:45:01,849
Just get out! Get out!

1653
01:45:38,964 --> 01:45:45,096
The roads are foggy.

1654
01:45:46,839 --> 01:45:51,833
Singing such gloomy songs.

1655
01:45:54,113 --> 01:46:00,848
What is life doing with me?

1656
01:46:09,862 --> 01:46:14,697
The roads are foggy.

1657
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:23,532
Singing such gloomy songs.

1658
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:31,545
What is life doing with me?

1659
01:46:47,733 --> 01:46:52,761
What l'd thought
will never happen.

1660
01:46:55,107 --> 01:46:59,635
l'll have to live
on other's condition.

1661
01:46:59,711 --> 01:47:02,578
This is not what l'd asked for.

1662
01:47:02,915 --> 01:47:09,844
ln what fog have l got lost?

1663
01:47:18,063 --> 01:47:23,592
Everything is so cold.

1664
01:47:26,004 --> 01:47:31,135
There is unbearable pain.

1665
01:47:33,011 --> 01:47:40,611
What is life doing with me?

1666
01:48:14,119 --> 01:48:16,053
Hello.
- Hi, love. Good morning.

1667
01:48:16,154 --> 01:48:18,987
Good morning.
- Give the phone to Ramji.

1668
01:48:19,825 --> 01:48:21,656
Ramji.
- Yes, Ramji.

1669
01:48:21,727 --> 01:48:22,921
l chucked him out of the house.

1670
01:48:22,995 --> 01:48:25,987
But why?
- You're asking me this?

1671
01:48:26,164 --> 01:48:28,257
Last night he
misbehaved so badly, still.

1672
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:30,999
Do you think he was
misbehaving with me?

1673
01:48:32,004 --> 01:48:34,268
No way. The police was
keeping a watch outside.

1674
01:48:34,339 --> 01:48:36,204
Police? - lf he'd seen
both of us in this manner..

1675
01:48:36,275 --> 01:48:38,209
..then we could have
been in a problem.

1676
01:48:38,677 --> 01:48:41,271
Why didn't Ramji tell me this?
- Didn't tell you!

1677
01:48:42,014 --> 01:48:43,743
You must have not given
him the chance to speak.

1678
01:48:44,216 --> 01:48:46,275
O God!
- l need to apologise.

1679
01:48:46,852 --> 01:48:50,015
l'll find out where he is.
l'll call you back, okay.

1680
01:48:50,088 --> 01:48:52,079
Okay, keep me posted. Bye.

1681
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:55,283
What! You chucked
Ramji out of the house!

1682
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,022
O God!
- You've gone mad, Sameera.

1683
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:00,960
Granny, it's a long story.
l'll just explain it to you.

1684
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:02,091
Please. One second.

1685
01:49:03,101 --> 01:49:07,697
Hello.. hello.. Appu. Hi. Sameera.
ls Ramji there?

1686
01:49:09,975 --> 01:49:13,308
Oh! Okay. No, no. Not to worry.
l'll call you back.

1687
01:49:13,712 --> 01:49:14,906
Take care. Yeah. Bye.

1688
01:49:15,113 --> 01:49:16,705
Sameera! Sameera!

1689
01:50:18,443 --> 01:50:26,976
Ramji.. Ramji.. Ramji.

1690
01:50:27,185 --> 01:50:35,183
Parvati! What are you doing here?

1691
01:50:38,063 --> 01:50:39,189
Ramji, l'm really sorry..

1692
01:50:39,264 --> 01:50:45,134
No, no, Sameera-ji.
The mistake is mine.

1693
01:50:48,306 --> 01:50:50,797
l'd forgotten that
between us there is not only..

1694
01:50:50,876 --> 01:50:53,811
..a difference of
6000-7000 miles but..

1695
01:50:53,879 --> 01:50:55,813
..a difference of
6-7 generations too.

1696
01:50:55,881 --> 01:50:59,817
You.. - ln our village if a
guy holds some girl's hand..

1697
01:50:59,885 --> 01:51:04,822
..then the whole village
forces them to marry each other.

1698
01:51:05,157 --> 01:51:07,819
But you after knowing
everything about Jai..

1699
01:51:07,893 --> 01:51:11,989
Look, Ramji. We'll talk
about this later. You look sick.

1700
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:14,994
What has happened to me?
l'm just the way as l was.

1701
01:51:15,367 --> 01:51:17,835
Yes, it's different if
you don't want to talk.

1702
01:51:17,903 --> 01:51:18,961
Ramji..

1703
01:51:19,037 --> 01:51:21,835
Ramji, no need to go to
work today. You're sick.

1704
01:51:21,907 --> 01:51:23,966
Tomorrow when you get well,
you can work day and night.

1705
01:51:24,042 --> 01:51:26,101
Sameera-ji, l'm well.
You don't worry about me.

1706
01:51:27,245 --> 01:51:29,839
Granny, why don't you stop him?

1707
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,846
How can l stop him? You're
his wife.. you stop him.

1708
01:51:33,051 --> 01:51:34,848
Listen, grandma,
you're pressing the..

1709
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,514
..husband-wife drama issue too much.

1710
01:51:38,023 --> 01:51:40,184
l'm all right. l'll see you later.

1711
01:51:40,358 --> 01:51:42,053
Ramji, listen.

1712
01:51:44,362 --> 01:51:46,057
O my God!

1713
01:51:49,034 --> 01:51:50,194
You tell me, what could l have done?

1714
01:51:53,271 --> 01:51:57,401
She knows everything.
l didn't know anything.

1715
01:51:59,478 --> 01:52:02,072
Unnecessarily l was
interfering in their matter.

1716
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:04,077
Sameera knows everything.
Are you sure?

1717
01:52:04,282 --> 01:52:05,874
Yes, sure, sure.

1718
01:52:07,385 --> 01:52:09,216
Not only does she know all this..

1719
01:52:09,287 --> 01:52:11,278
..but she has no
qualms about this matter.

1720
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:15,885
Now it's her life. She
can live the way she likes.

1721
01:52:19,231 --> 01:52:22,428
What happened?
- l feel a bit weak.

1722
01:52:23,235 --> 01:52:25,965
You've got fever.
- No, l'm fine.

1723
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:28,229
You can't even stand
how you can be fine.

1724
01:52:28,306 --> 01:52:29,898
You come with me. - Let it be.
The bus is about to come.

1725
01:52:29,975 --> 01:52:31,499
Come. l'll take you to
the doctor. Come with me.

1726
01:52:31,576 --> 01:52:32,907
Listen to me.

1727
01:52:41,319 --> 01:52:44,117
Sameera.
- Granny, there's good news.

1728
01:52:44,322 --> 01:52:47,382
Guess what? Ramji's
recipe has been selected.

1729
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:49,921
l've got a letter
from the organisers.

1730
01:52:50,095 --> 01:52:51,926
l've filled all the formalities.

1731
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:55,925
Sameera, can you come home soon?
Ramji is not well.

1732
01:52:56,268 --> 01:52:58,998
He has a high temperature too.
- Did you call the doctor?

1733
01:53:00,272 --> 01:53:02,604
Just give him the medicine
l've prescribed. - Okay.

1734
01:53:02,941 --> 01:53:05,000
He should be okay by tomorrow.
- Thank you doctor.

1735
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:06,939
Take care, young man.
- Greetings.

1736
01:53:08,213 --> 01:53:09,339
What was she saying?

1737
01:53:10,115 --> 01:53:11,548
She said, to take care of yourself.

1738
01:53:11,616 --> 01:53:12,947
You'll be well by tomorrow.

1739
01:53:13,018 --> 01:53:14,417
How will he not
take care of himself?

1740
01:53:14,486 --> 01:53:15,953
Now Ramji has to get well.

1741
01:53:16,021 --> 01:53:17,215
After all he has to
prepare for the competition.

1742
01:53:17,289 --> 01:53:18,347
Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

1743
01:53:18,423 --> 01:53:20,015
l've spent full 100
pounds for your entry fees.

1744
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:22,116
You've reached the
finals in the competition.

1745
01:53:22,494 --> 01:53:24,155
Congratulations.
- Wow!

1746
01:53:26,231 --> 01:53:29,166
Appu learn some good
recipe from Ramji quickly.

1747
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:30,962
Because he's going to
win the competition..

1748
01:53:31,036 --> 01:53:32,367
..and after that he'll
become a great chef.

1749
01:53:32,437 --> 01:53:34,496
And then he's not
going to come in our grasp.

1750
01:53:34,573 --> 01:53:36,040
Why are you joking, Guru brother.

1751
01:53:37,309 --> 01:53:39,436
l'm regretting taking an off today.

1752
01:53:39,511 --> 01:53:42,969
You just get well soon. Who
will read out a story to Sonu?

1753
01:53:43,148 --> 01:53:44,979
ln fact, l've myself become a story.

1754
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:47,109
Hey, if you both are here,
then who'll be in the restaurant?

1755
01:53:47,185 --> 01:53:48,243
No one.

1756
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,981
That's why l'm saying Guru
brother let me come with you.

1757
01:53:50,055 --> 01:53:52,182
Come on, you guys get back to work.

1758
01:53:52,324 --> 01:53:54,189
Sonu must be alone. l'll
manage the things at this end.

1759
01:53:54,259 --> 01:53:55,590
Okay, bye.
- Thanks. Ramji, take care.

1760
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,185
l should be thanking you. Bye.
See you. - Bye, Sam.

1761
01:54:00,065 --> 01:54:03,000
l forgot. Even l
should have thanked them.

1762
01:54:04,402 --> 01:54:07,200
Ramji, your bus stop friend
has come with the medicines.

1763
01:54:07,272 --> 01:54:08,330
Good girl.

1764
01:54:08,506 --> 01:54:09,996
Hi.
- Hi.

1765
01:54:10,275 --> 01:54:12,175
Now how are you feeling Ramji?
- Fine.

1766
01:54:12,277 --> 01:54:14,074
These are the medicines.
- l'll take it. Thanks.

1767
01:54:15,413 --> 01:54:19,008
He talks a lot about you.
- Really. Good or bad?

1768
01:54:19,184 --> 01:54:22,176
Mostly good.
- Why don't you sit down?

1769
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:24,012
Yeah, sure.
- Yes, do have a seat.

1770
01:54:27,292 --> 01:54:29,021
Congratulations for your engagement.

1771
01:54:29,494 --> 01:54:32,486
l hope you and Jai
have a good life together.

1772
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:35,632
Thank you so much. Do you know Jai?

1773
01:54:38,236 --> 01:54:39,362
Then what?

1774
01:54:39,437 --> 01:54:41,302
Would she have married
Jai without knowing him?

1775
01:54:47,646 --> 01:54:55,246
What?
- No she knows everything.

1776
01:54:57,455 --> 01:55:01,448
Sameera-ji, this is Avni-ji,
our Jai's first wife.

1777
01:55:13,471 --> 01:55:15,405
You said that you know everything.

1778
01:55:20,679 --> 01:55:23,671
Last night this is
what l was trying to..

1779
01:55:35,427 --> 01:55:36,485
Excuse me.

1780
01:56:11,396 --> 01:56:14,126
'What happened is that
for falling in love..

1781
01:56:14,199 --> 01:56:16,292
..lawyer was charging money.'

1782
01:56:16,534 --> 01:56:18,126
'The person who
charges so much money..

1783
01:56:18,203 --> 01:56:20,535
..he'll surely talk
about love and not hatred.'

1784
01:56:27,312 --> 01:56:28,609
lnsurance.. Excuse me.

1785
01:56:31,483 --> 01:56:34,145
Yeah, Sam. 9 o'clock Masti.
Yeah, okay.

1786
01:56:49,567 --> 01:56:53,435
Sameera, think properly
before you do anything.

1787
01:56:53,772 --> 01:56:56,366
Think from your head not your heart.

1788
01:56:56,641 --> 01:56:59,166
Understood. Okay, go dear.

1789
01:57:01,513 --> 01:57:04,175
Ramji, come. Go. Go.
- l go along with her?

1790
01:57:04,249 --> 01:57:05,682
Come, go, go with her. Go.

1791
01:57:06,451 --> 01:57:08,510
Sameera, listen..
- Don't touch me.

1792
01:57:09,587 --> 01:57:11,350
Look, Avni was a mistake.

1793
01:57:12,590 --> 01:57:16,185
And when l realised it, l ended it.

1794
01:57:17,462 --> 01:57:21,728
Oh, so Avni was a mistake.
And when did you realize it?

1795
01:57:24,602 --> 01:57:26,194
A few years after marriage.

1796
01:57:27,605 --> 01:57:31,200
Before Rahul was born.. or after?

1797
01:57:31,543 --> 01:57:36,879
Rahul. Rahul is not my son.

1798
01:57:40,885 --> 01:57:44,719
Really. So Rahul is not your son.

1799
01:57:53,631 --> 01:57:55,496
Don't insult my intelligence, Jai.

1800
01:57:57,502 --> 01:57:59,402
O God! You make me sick.

1801
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:05,234
l'd taken up the
courage to come here..

1802
01:58:07,512 --> 01:58:10,413
..because l'd thought at
least today you won't lie to me.

1803
01:58:13,585 --> 01:58:19,421
But you're such a bastard.
l feel ashamed of myself.

1804
01:58:21,993 --> 01:58:24,461
That l came so close
to a man like you.

1805
01:58:27,732 --> 01:58:29,256
A person who hasn't even seen..

1806
01:58:29,334 --> 01:58:31,268
..the face of his son
for the past 3 years.

1807
01:58:35,673 --> 01:58:37,732
By the way, how much
time will it take..

1808
01:58:37,809 --> 01:58:39,538
..for you to realize
that even l'm a mistake.

1809
01:58:41,613 --> 01:58:42,739
You're mistaken.

1810
01:58:49,454 --> 01:58:51,285
lf you have any self respect..

1811
01:58:51,456 --> 01:58:53,287
..you'll never come near me again.

1812
01:59:03,801 --> 01:59:05,826
Such imbecile men
don't have any effect.

1813
01:59:06,838 --> 01:59:09,306
ln spite so many
things have happened..

1814
01:59:09,374 --> 01:59:11,308
..he has threatened me and gone.
- Threat!

1815
01:59:11,776 --> 01:59:14,472
Yes. That he will get me imprisoned.

1816
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:18,305
And he will get Ramji
deported from the country.

1817
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:20,447
Hey! How can he throw me
out of the country like this?

1818
01:59:20,518 --> 01:59:22,918
After all he has taken so
much money from Guru. - Money!

1819
01:59:24,055 --> 01:59:25,317
For what?

1820
01:59:25,523 --> 01:59:28,583
ln order to remove Guru and me
out of these legal problems.

1821
01:59:29,594 --> 01:59:31,494
He was saying that he would
give all the money to you.

1822
01:59:31,796 --> 01:59:32,990
What a bastard!

1823
01:59:35,833 --> 01:59:38,734
Daughter, don't
underestimate his threat.

1824
01:59:39,404 --> 01:59:40,598
He can do anything.

1825
01:59:45,743 --> 01:59:50,510
Daughter, there is only one
way of being saved from all this.

1826
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:55,344
ln the immigration interview,
if you both will prove..

1827
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:58,355
..that your marriage is real
then not only Jai but the law also..

1828
01:59:58,423 --> 02:00:02,689
..will not be in a
position to harm both of you.

1829
02:00:02,961 --> 02:00:06,362
And that will be the
worst defeat for Jai.

1830
02:00:07,699 --> 02:00:10,691
Now you both have to know
everything about each other.

1831
02:00:13,771 --> 02:00:16,365
She was twelve or
thirteen years old when..

1832
02:00:16,441 --> 02:00:18,375
..she had won a
badminton tournament.

1833
02:00:18,543 --> 02:00:20,534
O my God! The trophy is too huge!

1834
02:00:22,714 --> 02:00:24,375
And this is her
childhood photograph..

1835
02:00:24,449 --> 02:00:26,849
..when she had an
allergy from bathing.

1836
02:00:26,918 --> 02:00:28,044
Granny, don't show this at least..

1837
02:00:28,119 --> 02:00:29,381
Yes. Yes. Don't show it to me.
Don't show it to me.

1838
02:00:29,587 --> 02:00:31,384
l don't know
anything about bathing..

1839
02:00:31,456 --> 02:00:33,651
..but she still has an
allergy of wearing clothes.

1840
02:00:34,859 --> 02:00:36,986
Hey! l was just joking!
Just kidding!

1841
02:00:37,462 --> 02:00:39,987
The number of her bike is BMWC1 .

1842
02:00:41,799 --> 02:00:43,790
ls it important to
know all this also?

1843
02:00:45,903 --> 02:00:47,894
Miss Sameera, what is your size?

1844
02:00:51,809 --> 02:00:54,004
34 B.
- 34 B!

1845
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:58,415
Hey! What are you saying?
This is an elephant's size.

1846
02:00:58,683 --> 02:01:01,413
ln my village, the maximum is..

1847
02:01:02,687 --> 02:01:04,746
Hey! lt is maximum 6 or 7.

1848
02:01:04,822 --> 02:01:06,016
Which size are you saying?

1849
02:01:09,827 --> 02:01:11,590
Are you sure about this, Mr. Kapoor?

1850
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:14,420
Yes. l am sure. l am
sure we will get..

1851
02:01:14,499 --> 02:01:16,433
..enough evidence to nail them.

1852
02:01:18,836 --> 02:01:21,031
Let's do it. We might get something.

1853
02:01:21,973 --> 02:01:23,440
l will teach a
lesson to those rascals.

1854
02:01:34,852 --> 02:01:35,978
My father's name was..

1855
02:01:39,724 --> 02:01:40,952
Hello.
- Hi Sammy!

1856
02:01:41,626 --> 02:01:44,117
Are you still angry with me?
- Jai!

1857
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:49,131
Thank God that you are
at least speaking to me.

1858
02:01:49,634 --> 02:01:51,932
l thought that you
would not even speak to me.

1859
02:01:52,637 --> 02:01:54,662
Please forgive me,
Sammy. l really love you.

1860
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,732
You are trying to prepare 'Jalebi'!

1861
02:01:56,974 --> 02:01:59,807
We will have kids. - Shall l
record it? - Exactly like you.

1862
02:02:00,878 --> 02:02:03,676
Please forgive me, Sammy. l
will explain everything to you.

1863
02:02:04,749 --> 02:02:07,479
l.. l cannot wait any
longer for our marriage.

1864
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:13,484
Marriage! Kids! l
have been married, Jai.

1865
02:02:13,825 --> 02:02:16,157
What rubbish! To
that illiterate man!

1866
02:02:16,828 --> 02:02:18,955
You have got married to him
only to save him from the law.

1867
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:20,088
Remember it.

1868
02:02:20,164 --> 02:02:23,497
And yes, honey that money
which you got for that marriage..

1869
02:02:23,568 --> 02:02:26,503
..l have deposited the entire
amount in our joint account.

1870
02:02:26,671 --> 02:02:28,571
You can withdraw that
money anytime you want.

1871
02:02:28,673 --> 02:02:30,766
That money does not belong to him.

1872
02:02:30,842 --> 02:02:32,503
And when these legal
matters will get over..

1873
02:02:32,577 --> 02:02:34,511
..then you divorce
that Pyaare fellow.

1874
02:02:34,912 --> 02:02:37,574
Then we both will get married.

1875
02:02:37,682 --> 02:02:39,582
l am very
desperately waiting for you.

1876
02:02:39,917 --> 02:02:41,509
Have you gone crazy?

1877
02:02:42,854 --> 02:02:44,515
About which money are you talking?

1878
02:02:44,856 --> 02:02:46,016
l don't understand you.

1879
02:02:46,691 --> 02:02:49,990
Listen Sameera, don't play
games with me. l am telling you.

1880
02:02:50,061 --> 02:02:53,519
Please Jai, l have
already been married.

1881
02:02:53,798 --> 02:02:55,698
And right now, Ramji is in my lap.

1882
02:02:55,867 --> 02:02:56,993
So please don't disturb us.

1883
02:02:57,802 --> 02:03:01,533
What? What is he doing on your lap?
- Coming darling, open the door!

1884
02:03:03,941 --> 02:03:06,535
With who are you talking, honey?

1885
02:03:07,945 --> 02:03:12,075
lt's nobody, darling. lt's just
Jai. - Fine. ls it brother Jai?

1886
02:03:12,717 --> 02:03:14,548
Why? ls it some important work?

1887
02:03:15,086 --> 02:03:17,554
When a husband and wife
are sleeping on their bed..

1888
02:03:17,622 --> 02:03:20,557
..and speaking about love then
you should not disturb them.

1889
02:03:20,625 --> 02:03:23,025
What do you think about it?
- Hey! Hey, Pyaare!

1890
02:03:23,094 --> 02:03:26,029
lf you will even touch
Sameera then l will kill you.

1891
02:03:26,964 --> 02:03:29,728
What is wrong with brother Jai?
- ls he drunk or what?

1892
02:03:30,835 --> 02:03:33,565
Hey honey! My waist
is paining a little.

1893
02:03:33,838 --> 02:03:35,567
Will you massage it a bit?

1894
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:37,731
Hey! What are both of you doing
over there? - Of course, sweetie!

1895
02:03:37,842 --> 02:03:39,571
Just remove the shirt
and lie down over here.

1896
02:03:39,844 --> 02:03:41,744
And what will l get in return?

1897
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:44,743
That which l give you every day.

1898
02:03:44,916 --> 02:03:46,975
Oh baby! Come here fast.

1899
02:03:50,988 --> 02:03:53,183
You bastards! You are
going to pay for this.

1900
02:03:53,257 --> 02:03:54,588
l am coming there.

1901
02:04:02,867 --> 02:04:04,801
He might be dreaming
about so many things now.

1902
02:04:08,873 --> 02:04:10,602
You are very naughty, Ramji.

1903
02:04:10,775 --> 02:04:11,867
And you are no less.

1904
02:04:11,943 --> 02:04:13,604
Look at your hand. There
are marks on your hand.

1905
02:04:13,678 --> 02:04:14,804
O my God!

1906
02:04:18,015 --> 02:04:19,141
Poor guy!

1907
02:04:34,899 --> 02:04:36,025
Will you have some coffee?

1908
02:04:36,167 --> 02:04:38,692
That's great! Will you
prepare the coffee today?

1909
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:41,165
lt will be worth watching.
- Shut up!

1910
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:43,800
l don't know whether
you will like it or no.

1911
02:04:45,977 --> 02:04:47,638
How can l dare to say that
the coffee is not good..

1912
02:04:47,712 --> 02:04:50,647
..when you have prepared it?
And l was saying that..

1913
02:04:52,984 --> 02:04:54,645
What else happens in your village?

1914
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:56,653
Hey! lf l will wear such
clothes and come out in the village..

1915
02:04:56,721 --> 02:04:58,655
..then the dogs will run after me.

1916
02:04:58,923 --> 02:05:01,653
All my friends will say
that a hero has come. A hero.

1917
02:05:01,926 --> 02:05:03,120
And the way the girls
dress up over here..

1918
02:05:03,194 --> 02:05:04,661
..if they will dress up in
the same way in the village..

1919
02:05:04,729 --> 02:05:06,321
..then there will be a huge fair.

1920
02:05:06,731 --> 02:05:07,925
To see the clothes!

1921
02:05:09,066 --> 02:05:10,658
But where do they wear the
clothes in order to see it?

1922
02:05:11,068 --> 02:05:12,660
Ramji.
- Yes, it's true.

1923
02:05:12,737 --> 02:05:15,137
By the way, l think that l
should wear this for the interview.

1924
02:05:17,842 --> 02:05:20,174
Give it to me. l
will help you wear it.

1925
02:05:21,078 --> 02:05:24,946
And won't you put
that ring on my finger.

1926
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:30,678
Wait l'll try it by myself.

1927
02:05:32,023 --> 02:05:35,151
There's something true..

1928
02:05:47,038 --> 02:05:51,031
ln the night also,
the firefly shines.

1929
02:05:52,877 --> 02:05:56,711
The fragrance is
spilled from your eyes.

1930
02:05:58,049 --> 02:06:02,110
ls it a dream or is it magic?

1931
02:06:03,988 --> 02:06:06,718
Do l know it or do you know it?

1932
02:06:08,059 --> 02:06:10,254
Look over there. He
is my first boyfriend.

1933
02:06:10,328 --> 02:06:12,387
Hey! Many people have
girlfriends and boyfriends in America.

1934
02:06:12,897 --> 02:06:15,263
Hey! Please tell me about Parvati.

1935
02:06:15,333 --> 02:06:17,324
ln my village l have a
sister named Parvati.

1936
02:06:17,401 --> 02:06:18,732
What do l tell you about Parvati?
She's very beautiful.

1937
02:06:19,070 --> 02:06:21,937
Yes. Nothing is strange actually.

1938
02:06:22,907 --> 02:06:24,738
Yes, you are right.

1939
02:06:41,092 --> 02:06:45,961
My mind has become very pleasant.

1940
02:06:49,166 --> 02:06:53,762
What is this miracle?

1941
02:06:58,042 --> 02:07:07,940
Look, that has happened to me
which never happened before.

1942
02:07:10,187 --> 02:07:14,123
The wind touches us softly.

1943
02:07:15,259 --> 02:07:19,787
lts asks us about our well being.

1944
02:07:21,132 --> 02:07:28,971
Somebody walks along with me
who is exactly similar to me.

1945
02:07:29,273 --> 02:07:33,801
Sameera, Ramji has reached
the finals of the competition.

1946
02:07:34,412 --> 02:07:36,209
Look at this.
- Wow!

1947
02:07:36,414 --> 02:07:38,006
But madam how is the hamper?
Please tell me.

1948
02:07:39,417 --> 02:07:40,975
Come on, l have to do
a lot of preparations.

1949
02:08:10,114 --> 02:08:14,847
The shade seems to
be very appealing.

1950
02:08:19,256 --> 02:08:24,023
The heat seems to
be very chilled now.

1951
02:08:26,263 --> 02:08:31,064
Come, lets have a discussion.

1952
02:08:33,137 --> 02:08:38,131
The night seems to be very sleepy.

1953
02:08:38,409 --> 02:08:42,140
What is this confusion?

1954
02:08:43,948 --> 02:08:48,078
Why is there this discomfort?

1955
02:08:49,353 --> 02:08:57,283
What is it that is
happening to us very slowly?

1956
02:09:15,379 --> 02:09:16,903
Hey Chutki! You have remembered..

1957
02:09:16,981 --> 02:09:18,915
..your brother after many days.

1958
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:21,309
Yeah. You are very naughty.

1959
02:09:24,455 --> 02:09:27,185
Respected brother, l
seek your blessings.

1960
02:09:27,258 --> 02:09:28,919
We are very well over here.

1961
02:09:29,093 --> 02:09:31,323
And we just pray for your happiness.

1962
02:09:31,428 --> 02:09:34,192
We are very happy. Take
care of yourself. - You too!

1963
02:09:34,331 --> 02:09:38,529
l am very happy to tell you
that my in-laws love me a lot.

1964
02:09:38,602 --> 02:09:39,933
Thanks a million to the Almighty.

1965
02:09:40,004 --> 02:09:41,938
They take good care of me.

1966
02:09:42,339 --> 02:09:45,536
You don't worry
about me. l am very fine.

1967
02:09:46,277 --> 02:09:48,939
l did not get the pencil. That
is why, l am writing with a pen.

1968
02:09:51,282 --> 02:09:52,943
l wish that
everything would be fine.

1969
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:56,945
'lf you will have more problems
then write the letter in pencil.'

1970
02:09:57,021 --> 02:09:58,215
'l will understand it.'

1971
02:10:01,358 --> 02:10:02,950
The in-laws are
taking good care of me.

1972
02:10:04,295 --> 02:10:06,160
l never experienced
such happiness before.

1973
02:10:08,365 --> 02:10:10,959
Parvati! Parvati!

1974
02:10:12,369 --> 02:10:13,495
Go, bride. Leave now.

1975
02:10:13,571 --> 02:10:16,131
Now l plead to you that
please leave from here.

1976
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:19,568
Look Parvati, now it is
not a question of money.

1977
02:10:20,144 --> 02:10:21,975
Now our patience has come to an end.

1978
02:10:22,046 --> 02:10:24,514
Your brother Ramji has
made a big fool of me.

1979
02:10:24,582 --> 02:10:26,982
He himself got married
and he ruined your house.

1980
02:10:27,184 --> 02:10:30,449
Father, don't say this.
At least listen to me.

1981
02:10:30,521 --> 02:10:32,182
Look Parvati, now
there is no other way out.

1982
02:10:32,456 --> 02:10:34,981
Before l become a beast and
do something evil to you..

1983
02:10:35,059 --> 02:10:38,654
..please spare us
and leave from here.

1984
02:10:44,068 --> 02:10:45,399
Hey! lts the limit of deceiving.

1985
02:10:45,469 --> 02:10:47,403
Then why did he promise us
to give the money on time?

1986
02:10:47,471 --> 02:10:48,529
We called up Ramji so many times.

1987
02:10:48,606 --> 02:10:50,198
But then too he did
not have the right sense.

1988
02:10:50,274 --> 02:10:53,209
Hello. l wanted to speak to Ramji.

1989
02:10:53,410 --> 02:10:57,210
He is not at home. And who
are you.. - Sister-in-law!

1990
02:10:58,349 --> 02:11:02,012
Parvati! - How did you
know that l am speaking?

1991
02:11:02,186 --> 02:11:04,416
The person who knows Ramji,
how will he not know you?

1992
02:11:04,521 --> 02:11:07,490
He speaks so much about you..
- Can l speak to Ramji?

1993
02:11:09,493 --> 02:11:13,224
Parvati, is everything
all right? Please tell me.

1994
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:16,297
Consider that you are
speaking to Ramji. Tell me.

1995
02:11:20,437 --> 02:11:22,302
They have thrown
me out of the house.

1996
02:11:24,441 --> 02:11:26,033
l am standing out in the night.

1997
02:11:27,511 --> 02:11:29,035
l am feeling scared also.

1998
02:11:31,448 --> 02:11:34,042
l called him up at Patna
also then they banged..

1999
02:11:34,118 --> 02:11:36,382
..the phone down
after hearing my voice.

2000
02:11:42,226 --> 02:11:46,060
l kept on saying that it has
delayed by a few days only.

2001
02:11:47,464 --> 02:11:49,398
After all Ramji is working hard.

2002
02:11:50,467 --> 02:11:53,265
But they did not listen to me.

2003
02:11:58,542 --> 02:12:02,239
l was thinking that l should die.

2004
02:12:04,481 --> 02:12:06,244
And put an end to all this mess.

2005
02:12:09,353 --> 02:12:14,256
But Papu saved me.
- Papu!

2006
02:12:14,491 --> 02:12:17,358
He is the childhood friend of Ramji.

2007
02:12:19,363 --> 02:12:25,097
l will.. Wait, talk to Papu you.

2008
02:12:27,504 --> 02:12:31,099
Greetings! - Whatever you did,
thank you for that.

2009
02:12:32,509 --> 02:12:34,443
Will you support Parvati?

2010
02:12:34,611 --> 02:12:37,774
Let anything happen. But l will
never let her cry after today.

2011
02:12:38,649 --> 02:12:40,116
Will you get married to her?

2012
02:12:40,284 --> 02:12:42,650
l already told you
that let anything happen.

2013
02:12:43,454 --> 02:12:44,648
She will not be sad now.

2014
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:47,248
l will support her
throughout her life.

2015
02:12:47,324 --> 02:12:50,316
But what about him? - Don't worry about
her. Just give the phone to Parvati.

2016
02:12:54,465 --> 02:13:00,131
Look Parvati, if anything will
happen to you then Ramji will die.

2017
02:13:01,472 --> 02:13:03,133
You have called me
your sister-in-law.

2018
02:13:03,607 --> 02:13:06,303
So now whatever l am telling you,
listen to me carefully.

2019
02:13:33,704 --> 02:13:35,695
Hello. Bank of London!

2020
02:13:35,773 --> 02:13:38,435
Bank of London customer services.
What can l do for you, madam?

2021
02:13:38,509 --> 02:13:40,374
Yeah. l just wanted to get
some money transferred to lndia.

2022
02:13:40,511 --> 02:13:42,172
Yes, sure. Could you
give me some details?

2023
02:13:42,379 --> 02:13:44,176
Could you brief me on that?
- Yeah, sure.

2024
02:13:44,248 --> 02:13:46,341
But that's impossible.
l mean how can that be?

2025
02:13:46,517 --> 02:13:48,246
Well, that's what is here, sir.

2026
02:13:48,652 --> 02:13:50,244
What seems to be the problem, sir?

2027
02:13:50,521 --> 02:13:52,512
Look, l have a joint
account in your bank.

2028
02:13:52,689 --> 02:13:55,180
But this gentleman says l
have no money in my account.

2029
02:13:55,259 --> 02:13:56,521
How's that possible.

2030
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:59,322
lt is very simple, sir. Your
partner has withdrawn all your money.

2031
02:13:59,396 --> 02:14:00,658
There is nothing we can do, sir.

2032
02:14:03,534 --> 02:14:05,195
You have betrayed me.

2033
02:14:05,602 --> 02:14:07,661
l love you so much.
And you ditched me..

2034
02:14:07,738 --> 02:14:09,797
..for that bloody illiterate man!

2035
02:14:10,541 --> 02:14:11,735
l will not spare you.

2036
02:14:12,476 --> 02:14:14,205
And l will not spare Ramji also.

2037
02:14:15,479 --> 02:14:16,605
Do you challenge me?

2038
02:14:17,714 --> 02:14:19,272
l will get you imprisoned.

2039
02:14:19,616 --> 02:14:21,208
l will get both of you imprisoned.

2040
02:14:22,619 --> 02:14:23,813
Just watch out. l will go in
the morning tomorrow and..

2041
02:14:23,887 --> 02:14:25,218
..inform the people in
the immigration officers..

2042
02:14:25,289 --> 02:14:26,415
..that what is the truth?

2043
02:14:27,758 --> 02:14:30,886
They both have
together ruined my life.

2044
02:14:32,629 --> 02:14:35,393
l just wanted to help you, Guru.
- Oh! Shut up, Jai!

2045
02:14:36,767 --> 02:14:41,227
You were betraying
Sameera and me. All of us..

2046
02:14:41,405 --> 02:14:43,498
Whatever you did, you just
did it for your own greed.

2047
02:14:44,708 --> 02:14:46,232
And l always considered
you as my friend, Jai.

2048
02:14:47,644 --> 02:14:49,635
l couldn't even think that
you would do such a thing.

2049
02:14:50,414 --> 02:14:56,649
Oh! So even you have
been misled by this chef!

2050
02:15:00,791 --> 02:15:04,249
Guru! Don't forget
that if l want then..

2051
02:15:04,328 --> 02:15:06,796
..l can get you also imprisoned.

2052
02:15:10,434 --> 02:15:13,267
lt will be better if you will
not speak about going to the jail.

2053
02:15:16,673 --> 02:15:21,667
Because if l want then l can
get you imprisoned right now.

2054
02:15:22,779 --> 02:15:24,269
The issue about our divorce,
Rahul's expenses..

2055
02:15:24,348 --> 02:15:27,283
..from the past three
years and you have not even..

2056
02:15:27,351 --> 02:15:29,683
..given anything
for my expense also.

2057
02:15:30,687 --> 02:15:32,621
l don't need your money.

2058
02:15:34,892 --> 02:15:38,293
But then too, l will
not step back from..

2059
02:15:38,362 --> 02:15:41,297
..getting you
imprisoned for this crime.

2060
02:15:44,635 --> 02:15:48,366
Jai, what are you doing?

2061
02:15:49,573 --> 02:15:50,835
What is wrong with you?

2062
02:15:51,775 --> 02:15:53,572
How much more will you stoop now?

2063
02:15:54,912 --> 02:15:56,504
How much more will you stoop?

2064
02:16:19,736 --> 02:16:24,332
My life is finished! Finished!

2065
02:16:24,408 --> 02:16:25,602

02:16:41,758 --> 02:16:43,419
Yes, it is Middlesex only.
You are right. Go ahead.

2072
02:16:43,493 --> 02:16:44,619
What type of a name is it?

2073
02:16:44,695 --> 02:16:45,889
lt is a very bad name. lt
is so vulgar. Middlesex!

2074
02:16:46,029 --> 02:16:47,894
Village is Takipur.

2075

Her father used to
work in Howard company.

2078
02:16:55,639 --> 02:17:00,702
Her father and her mother
died in a car accident in 1993.

2079
02:17:00,777 --> 02:17:01,903
The village is Takipur.

02:17:01,979 --> 02:17:05,847
His friend's name is..

Hey! The number of my village has
been connected! - Give it to me.

2084
02:17:14,725 --> 02:17:17,387
Hello! Hey! Did you call Papu or no?

2085
02:17:17,794 --> 02:17:20,786
No..
- Ramji! - Hey Papu!

2086
02:17:21,565 --> 02:17:25,399
Please forgive me, Ramji.
- Hey Papu! Let it be.

2087
02:17:25,469 --> 02:17:27,664
No Ramji. You might
have felt very bad.

2088
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:31,401
But we did not
have any other choice.

2089
02:17:32,743 --> 02:17:34,802
The whole village was
speaking about various things.

2090
02:17:36,013 --> 02:17:37,947
How could l hear so
much about Parvati?

2091
02:17:38,882 --> 02:17:40,406
How could l leave
her alone like that?

2092
02:17:41,585 --> 02:17:42,882
l took an advice from sister-in-law.

2093
02:17:44,888 --> 02:17:47,413
And with her permission, l
got married to Parvati..

2094
02:17:47,491 --> 02:17:49,925
..in front of the entire village.

2095
02:17:51,828 --> 02:17:55,559
lf you think that l have done
any mistake then please forgive me.

2096
02:17:55,766 --> 02:18:00,601
Hey! Actually l should
apologize to Parvati and to you.

2097
02:18:02,706 --> 02:18:03,832
l only could not understand it.

02:18:10,847 --> 02:18:14,442
Papu. Papu, please forgive me.

Hey! You don't worry at all. l

By the way, your mother's

2129
02:19:29,126 --> 02:19:30,855
Not Anumati but Arundathi.

02:21:15,131 --> 02:21:16,621
He loves her very much.

2159
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:17,892
What's her shoe size?

2160
02:21:18,034 --> 02:21:19,626
Her shoe size is 7.

2161
02:21:19,970 --> 02:21:21,961
For the first time when l
asked her the size of her shoes..

2162
02:21:22,038 --> 02:21:23,972
..then she told me
that the number is 34.

2163
02:21:24,140 --> 02:21:27,632
And then we came to know
that 34 is the number of her..

2164
02:21:27,711 --> 02:21:29,178
Her shoe size is 7.

2165
02:21:29,246 --> 02:21:31,646
Why did you both hurry up
so much in getting married?

2166
02:21:32,983 --> 02:21:35,645
What?
- Within two days.

2167
02:21:35,986 --> 02:21:38,716
Actually, granny was
suddenly not feeling well.

2168
02:21:39,055 --> 02:21:41,114
Granny was not at all
ready to listen to us.

2169
02:21:41,191 --> 02:21:44,649
She told us that before dying
she wishes to see our married.

2170
02:21:47,731 --> 02:21:53,670
Fine. Tell me that what did you
like the most about your wife?

2171
02:21:53,937 --> 02:21:56,667
Look, she has been very
independent since her childhood.

2172
02:21:57,274 --> 02:22:00,004
She has single-handedly
taken care of her family.

2173
02:22:01,011 --> 02:22:02,137
Exactly Like me.

2174
02:22:02,212 --> 02:22:04,203
What really drove me
towards him was his innocence..

2175
02:22:04,281 --> 02:22:05,680
..his simplicity.

2176
02:22:06,016 --> 02:22:08,678
The harder and tough
she looks from outside..

2177
02:22:08,752 --> 02:22:11,152
..she is very soft
and subtle from inside.

2178
02:22:11,221 --> 02:22:13,689
ln spite of being so simple,
his thinking ability..

2179
02:22:13,757 --> 02:22:16,021
..was much more than
many of the literate people.

2180
02:22:16,293 --> 02:22:18,693
Her mind is exactly
like a child's mind.

2181
02:22:19,029 --> 02:22:20,690
There is such an
understanding in Ramji..

2182
02:22:20,764 --> 02:22:23,858
..which simplifies the
most crucial problems.

2183
02:22:24,167 --> 02:22:26,032
She gets angry very quickly.

2184
02:22:28,171 --> 02:22:30,036
But she is very nice by heart.

2185
02:22:30,874 --> 02:22:34,970
Such an innocent smile which
spreads around everywhere.

2186
02:22:35,211 --> 02:22:39,113
When she gets angry then heavy
tears fall off from her eyes.

2187
02:22:43,119 --> 02:22:48,056
Before even l can realize,
Ramji realizes it..

2188
02:22:48,124 --> 02:22:51,184
..that what do l want
and when do l want it?

2189
02:22:54,197 --> 02:22:55,789
Just like my mother.

2190
02:22:56,066 --> 02:22:58,728
But if l will lovingly
caress her even once..

2191
02:22:58,802 --> 02:23:01,327
..then she becomes
extremely humble again.

2192
02:23:03,139 --> 02:23:10,011
Ramji made me realize that l
can once again live my childhood.

2193
02:23:12,248 --> 02:23:13,738
He is a wonderful man!

2194
02:23:19,155 --> 02:23:20,747
What a wonderful pair!

2195
02:23:21,925 --> 02:23:23,756
l am very jealous of you.

2196
02:23:24,094 --> 02:23:25,288
Congratulations!

2197
02:23:25,362 --> 02:23:27,922
Congratulations! And all
the very best. - Thank you.

2198
02:23:29,265 --> 02:23:30,357
Thanks!

2199
02:23:31,034 --> 02:23:34,765
Fine. Now a last question
on my behalf. On my behalf.

2200
02:23:35,171 --> 02:23:40,302
Don't worry. You are a chef from
a very small village of Bihar.

2201
02:23:41,044 --> 02:23:42,773
And Sameera has been
brought up over here. -Yes.

2202
02:23:42,846 --> 02:23:45,314
She is a travel agent.
She is completely western.

2203
02:23:45,448 --> 02:23:48,781
Do you think that she
will be able to fulfill..

2204
02:23:48,852 --> 02:23:52,788
..the responsibility of
a dutiful lndian wife?

2205
02:23:53,256 --> 02:23:55,121
l don't know
anything about all that.

2206
02:23:55,392 --> 02:24:00,261
But l definitely know this that
she never made fun that l am a chef.

2207
02:24:01,197 --> 02:24:03,791
And she has done a big
thing than that also.

2208
02:24:05,135 --> 02:24:07,194
Such a work for which
even l wouldn't have been..

2209
02:24:07,270 --> 02:24:09,135
..able to gather strength alone.

2210
02:24:13,343 --> 02:24:17,803
She single handedly got my
sister settled in her life.

2211
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:22,812
Hey! ln order to
settle Parvati's life..

2212
02:24:22,886 --> 02:24:25,821
..she sent all the
money to my village..

2213
02:24:25,889 --> 02:24:29,882
..which she had
received for becoming my wife.

2214
02:24:36,099 --> 02:24:38,294
Only an lndian wife
can fulfill this deed.

2215
02:24:50,246 --> 02:24:52,840
Ramji, you have flown with
your emotions and you have..

2216
02:24:52,916 --> 02:24:55,248
..said something more than
required. - What are you saying?

2217
02:24:57,253 --> 02:24:59,517
Fine. Regarding the money.

2218
02:25:00,123 --> 02:25:05,026
Brother, please don't do this.
l will be ruined.

2219
02:25:06,262 --> 02:25:08,457
Many people's life depends on it.

2220
02:25:10,133 --> 02:25:11,862
Please do something, brother.

2221
02:25:33,156 --> 02:25:35,056
Hey! l am your wife.
You can surely hug me.

2222
02:25:59,415 --> 02:26:00,905
Everything has been ruined.

2223
02:26:05,088 --> 02:26:07,921
Come up with me, please. Come.

2224
02:26:30,346 --> 02:26:32,143
Sameera, now you must talk to him.

2225
02:26:33,283 --> 02:26:34,944
At least let him know.

2226
02:26:35,485 --> 02:26:37,282
You have to tell him how you feel.

2227
02:26:38,221 --> 02:26:42,282
l don't understand anything.

2228
02:26:46,362 --> 02:26:48,956
Everything was going
on well. Everything.

2229
02:26:51,234 --> 02:26:52,428
And now..

2230
02:27:07,450 --> 02:27:08,974
Come on, Mr. Ramji. Please.

2231
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:13,983
l cannot understand that how
will l ever repay your favors?

2232
02:27:15,391 --> 02:27:17,325
Especially of Miss Sameera.

2233
02:27:17,527 --> 02:27:22,260
No son. This was a very
new experience for all of us.

2234
02:27:23,399 --> 02:27:25,264
We had some good time, son.

2235
02:27:27,403 --> 02:27:28,995
By the way, where is she?

2236
02:27:29,072 --> 02:27:31,597
Son, she did not come over here.

2237
02:27:33,409 --> 02:27:38,142
She couldn't gain the
courage to meet you.

2238
02:27:40,350 --> 02:27:41,476
l can understand.

2239
02:27:45,288 --> 02:27:48,018
Greetings, granny! l will leave now.

2240
02:27:53,296 --> 02:27:54,490
Come on.

2241
02:28:05,308 --> 02:28:07,037
Please let me bid
goodbye to the child.

2242
02:28:17,453 --> 02:28:20,445
Hey! Child Sonu, who will
tell stories to you now?

2243
02:28:22,525 --> 02:28:24,049
Won't you look over here?

2244
02:28:46,416 --> 02:28:48,350
Mr. Ramji! Mr. Ramji!

2245
02:28:48,484 --> 02:28:52,079
We are delighted to be able to
reveal that you are the winner..

2246
02:28:52,155 --> 02:28:55,420
..of the elephant brand 'atta'
dish with a different competition.

2247
02:28:57,427 --> 02:29:00,089
As a winner, you
have won 50000 pounds..

2248
02:29:00,163 --> 02:29:04,099
..and we will be more than happy
to offer you the job as head chef.

2249
02:29:04,267 --> 02:29:05,700
Hey! What are they saying?

2250
02:29:06,169 --> 02:29:08,569
He is telling you that you
have won the competition, Ramji.

2251
02:29:08,705 --> 02:29:11,640
What? - l mean that now
everything will be all right.

2252
02:29:12,275 --> 02:29:13,367
You have won the competition, Ramji.

2253
02:29:13,443 --> 02:29:15,638
You are the first lndian winner.
What is the secret?

2254
02:29:16,112 --> 02:29:17,511
Excuse me everybody!

2255
02:29:17,613 --> 02:29:20,104
Before this gets
any more confusing..

2256
02:29:20,183 --> 02:29:22,583
..this man is not allowed to
do anything in this country.

2257
02:29:22,652 --> 02:29:25,382
As he has been claimed
as an illegal immigrate.

2258
02:29:26,456 --> 02:29:28,390
Now allow me to take
him to the airport now.

2259
02:29:28,458 --> 02:29:30,119
As we are late already. - Hey!
Brother Guru, you were saying..

2260
02:29:30,193 --> 02:29:31,455
..that everything
has become all right.

2261
02:29:31,527 --> 02:29:33,119
Then why isn't this
inspector listening to me?

2262
02:29:33,196 --> 02:29:35,130
Ramji!
- Somebody please do something!

2263
02:29:35,198 --> 02:29:36,392
This is not fair.

2264
02:29:36,466 --> 02:29:38,331
How can they just take him away?
- Please ma'am.

2265
02:29:38,401 --> 02:29:40,130
This is a police matter.

2266
02:29:42,305 --> 02:29:44,671
He is our winner. You can't do
this. - Please Ramji. Please!

2267
02:29:45,408 --> 02:29:48,741
Please leave him, officer. How
can you take him away like this?

2268
02:29:48,811 --> 02:29:51,678
Just get out of the way, madam.
- No! No! Ramji!

2269
02:30:05,762 --> 02:30:07,161
Hi, this is Emilie.

2270
02:30:07,497 --> 02:30:09,328
Can l speak to the chairman please?

2271
02:30:09,565 --> 02:30:12,432
l have received the papers
from the lndian embassy. Yeah!

2272
02:31:39,589 --> 02:31:41,250
Excuse me, officer.
- Yes, my highness.

2273
02:31:42,325 --> 02:31:44,259
Mr. Ramji is not an
illegal immigrate.

2274
02:31:44,460 --> 02:31:45,791
He lost his passport
and his work permit..

2275
02:31:45,862 --> 02:31:47,659
..when he arrived in the country.

2276
02:31:48,531 --> 02:31:51,261
Yes, he has the copy of the
document and the verification..

2277
02:31:51,334 --> 02:31:53,928
..of their authenticity by
the lndian high commission.

2278
02:31:54,604 --> 02:31:57,437
And here is an
order for his release.

2279
02:31:57,874 --> 02:32:01,537
lt seems he has been
sponsored by a British company.

2280
02:32:02,445 --> 02:32:04,606
Hey! Does this guy
seem to be the owner?

2281
02:32:05,681 --> 02:32:07,672
l guess Mr. Ramji is a free man now.

2282
02:32:09,452 --> 02:32:11,283
What happened?
- Yeah! Wow!

2283
02:32:11,354 --> 02:32:14,881
Hey! What happened?
- Congratulations, Ramji!

2284
02:32:14,957 --> 02:32:16,288
They are saying that
you are absolutely free.

2285
02:32:16,359 --> 02:32:18,759
Well done! Here, we
appoint you as head chef.

2286
02:32:19,562 --> 02:32:20,620
What are they saying?

2287
02:32:20,696 --> 02:32:22,493
Hey! You are free.
They cannot arrest you.

2288
02:32:22,632 --> 02:32:24,293
lf you want then you
can even stay here.

2289
02:32:25,568 --> 02:32:26,626
Mr. Ramji, now that you have won..

2290
02:32:26,702 --> 02:32:27,828
..what are you going to
do with the prize money?

2291
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:29,496
They are asking you that what
will you do with the prize money?

2292
02:32:30,907 --> 02:32:32,704
Hey! Does this
money belong to me now?

2293
02:32:32,775 --> 02:32:34,504
The entire amount of money.
Every single penny.

2294
02:32:34,577 --> 02:32:35,839
And now you don't need to go.

2295
02:32:35,912 --> 02:32:37,311
lf you want then you
can stay over here.

2296
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:38,711
Everything will be all right.
- Yes Ramji.

2297
02:32:39,782 --> 02:32:41,306
Can l take this
and go to my village?

2298
02:32:50,726 --> 02:32:52,318
Go home. Money! My money!

2299
02:32:52,795 --> 02:32:54,319
Why will you go back now?

2300
02:32:54,730 --> 02:32:55,924
Why will you go back to the village?

2301
02:32:55,998 --> 02:32:57,329
Now that everything is
all right over here.

2302
02:32:57,667 --> 02:32:59,498
Yes, brother Guru.
Everything is all right.

2303
02:33:00,403 --> 02:33:02,337
Hey! l had come here to
settle Parvati's house.

2304
02:33:02,405 --> 02:33:03,599
Now Parvati's life is also settled.

2305
02:33:03,673 --> 02:33:05,607
Now with this money, l
will repay your debt also.

2306
02:33:05,741 --> 02:33:07,333
Hey! But why do you want to go back?

2307
02:33:08,411 --> 02:33:11,676
Hey sister-in-law! l had
not come here to earn money.

2308
02:33:12,949 --> 02:33:14,348
l had just come here
to solve a problem.

2309
02:33:14,417 --> 02:33:15,679
And it has been solved.

2310
02:33:15,851 --> 02:33:18,342
And in spite of that, if l
will continue to stay over here..

2311
02:33:18,421 --> 02:33:21,356
..then l will live over here for
the sake of my greed and money.

2312
02:33:22,758 --> 02:33:26,694
As you all are saying that
l will become a great chef.

2313
02:33:27,530 --> 02:33:29,020
And l will earn lots of money also.

2314
02:33:29,832 --> 02:33:33,529
And l will even buy an old
Mercedes like all of you.

2315
02:33:35,838 --> 02:33:39,365
But what is the use of that
Mercedes if l will not be able..

2316
02:33:39,442 --> 02:33:42,707
..to see my Parvati and
Papu roaming around in it.

2317
02:33:43,779 --> 02:33:46,373
Hey brother Guru! What
is the use of that car..

2318
02:33:46,449 --> 02:33:48,383
..until my villagers
don't see me on it?

2319
02:33:49,719 --> 02:33:53,382
Hey! What is the use of
that fame when uncle Chotu..

2320
02:33:53,456 --> 02:33:57,392
..cannot reveal
about it in the open.

2321
02:33:58,561 --> 02:34:00,722
Hey! l will be eager to
see them throughout my life.

2322
02:34:01,731 --> 02:34:03,722
But.. But my villagers
will never be able..

2323
02:34:03,799 --> 02:34:05,892
..to reap the
benefits of my success.

2324
02:34:07,003 --> 02:34:08,868
And in London, l will be
left as a successful chef..

2325
02:34:08,938 --> 02:34:10,997
..and an incomplete man.

2326
02:34:12,808 --> 02:34:15,402
But brother Guru, if l will
take this money and go home..

2327
02:34:15,478 --> 02:34:18,413
..then you don't have
any idea that the dreams..

2328
02:34:18,481 --> 02:34:21,939
..of so many people
will be fulfilled.

2329
02:34:23,419 --> 02:34:26,582
Hey! My villagers will
be very proud of me.

2330
02:34:28,758 --> 02:34:30,953
Hey! l will open an
English medium school over there.

2331
02:34:31,027 --> 02:34:33,689
So that after me, nobody
will be illiterate over there.

2332
02:34:37,767 --> 02:34:40,429
And then the people
over there will say that..

2333
02:34:40,503 --> 02:34:43,028
..look over there, he
is Ramji Londonwale!

2334
02:34:45,841 --> 02:34:48,435
Brother Guru, that is my identity.

2335
02:34:49,945 --> 02:34:52,436
And that is the most
important thing for me.

2336
02:35:13,803 --> 02:35:18,001
Ramji! ls it
necessary for you to leave?

2337
02:35:19,875 --> 02:35:22,469
There are a few times in
life when you have to..

2338
02:35:22,545 --> 02:35:25,480
..make a choice between
the most loving thing..

2339
02:35:25,548 --> 02:35:27,743
..and your responsibilities.

2340
02:35:28,751 --> 02:35:32,482
My heart says that
choose your most loving thing.

2341
02:35:33,756 --> 02:35:36,816
But my mind says that take
care of your responsibility.

2342
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:40,492
Hey! The specialty of my
most loving thing is that..

2343
02:35:40,563 --> 02:35:44,499
..when l close my eyes
then she comes in front of me.

2344
02:35:45,901 --> 02:35:48,495
Btu for the sake of
my responsibilities..

2345
02:35:48,571 --> 02:35:50,562
..l cannot close my eyes, right?

2346
02:35:51,974 --> 02:35:54,499
l will remember it
throughout my life..

2347
02:35:54,577 --> 02:35:56,670
..that l had met an angel in London.

2348
02:35:57,847 --> 02:35:59,508
Whatever you said, it is true.

2349
02:36:00,850 --> 02:36:02,715
But l want to say something.

2350
02:36:02,785 --> 02:36:05,845
No. No, Miss Sameera.
Please. Please don't say anything.

2351
02:36:05,921 --> 02:36:08,515
Look, l have gained strength
through lots of difficulties..

2352
02:36:08,591 --> 02:36:10,786
..in order to say this.

2353
02:36:11,927 --> 02:36:14,725
Look, whatever is right,
l am doing that only.

2354
02:36:15,931 --> 02:36:19,059
And l want you to
support me in this also.

2355
02:36:31,881 --> 02:36:32,939
l will leave now.

2356
02:36:39,889 --> 02:36:43,552
Hey!
- You are a very strange man!

2357
02:36:43,893 --> 02:36:47,021
l used to think that l understand
all the love stories very well.

2358
02:36:47,897 --> 02:36:49,558
But you have made me understand..

2359
02:36:49,632 --> 02:36:51,566
..a different
version of this love story.

2360
02:36:51,834 --> 02:36:54,166
By the way, all the love
stories do have a happy ending.

2361
02:36:54,236 --> 02:36:56,568
But the end of your story
is that the two lovers..

2362
02:36:56,639 --> 02:36:58,732
..separate from each other.

2363
02:36:59,108 --> 02:37:01,235
But then too, this ending
seems to be appropriate.

2364
02:37:02,178 --> 02:37:03,736
You are a very strange person!

2365
02:37:06,115 --> 02:37:07,582
Take care of yourself.

2366
02:37:08,984 --> 02:37:10,576
Greetings!
- Greetings!

2367
02:37:18,994 --> 02:37:20,859
Hey, police officer! This is yours.

2368
02:37:25,768 --> 02:37:27,929
lt's a pleasure to restore
your dignity to you, Mr. Ramji.

2369
02:37:28,771 --> 02:37:29,931
l was only doing my duty.

2370
02:37:30,005 --> 02:37:33,771
What?
- Been a privilege to know you.

2371
02:37:34,109 --> 02:37:36,600
And if you ever do
come back to England..

2372
02:37:36,679 --> 02:37:39,614
..then you have always
got a place to stay..

2373
02:37:39,682 --> 02:37:41,809
..and a friend to trust.
You take care.

2374
02:37:42,017 --> 02:37:43,882
What are you saying? l
cannot understand anything.

2375
02:37:45,888 --> 02:37:47,617
But a heart
understands the matter of heart.

2376
02:37:47,790 --> 02:37:49,018
You are saying something good only.

2377
02:37:49,892 --> 02:37:51,018
You are a very good inspector.

2378
02:37:52,027 --> 02:37:53,619
Greetings!
- Greetings!

2379
02:38:02,238 --> 02:38:08,643
Nobody should cast an evil eye.
- Ramji!

2380
02:38:08,811 --> 02:38:18,186
Nobody should cast an evil
eye on my Ramji. - Ramji!

2381
02:38:31,267 --> 02:38:32,666
Whatever has happened,
it has already happened.

2382
02:38:36,071 --> 02:38:37,663
l wish that l could tell him.

2383
02:38:40,943 --> 02:38:42,069
Just once..

2384
02:38:46,148 --> 02:38:48,139
But he did not give
me a chance, granny.

2385
02:38:54,223 --> 02:38:56,020
Now l will never meet him again.

2386
02:38:59,161 --> 02:39:04,690
l will miss him.
- l will miss you too.

2387
02:39:06,101 --> 02:39:12,700
l will miss both of you.
- What?

2388
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:17,704
You silly girl! ln life,
you just get one chance..

2389
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:21,238
..to meet a person like Ramji.

2390
02:39:22,985 --> 02:39:25,715
And then not to tell
him about your feelings..

2391
02:39:25,788 --> 02:39:27,983
..will be a very foolish thing.

2392
02:39:31,126 --> 02:39:35,119
Hey girl! Don't
lose this opportunity.

2393
02:39:39,902 --> 02:39:42,336
Take this. These are your
passport and your tickets.

2394
02:39:43,272 --> 02:39:47,868
Before it is too late, go for
it baby. He is the man for you.

2395
02:39:47,943 --> 02:39:49,740
Go for it. Come on.

2396
02:39:50,079 --> 02:39:52,206
Granny!
- Yes, my child!

2397
02:39:53,916 --> 02:39:55,747
Go for it. Go.

2398
02:39:56,151 --> 02:39:59,746
Go ahead, child!
Don't miss this chance.

2399
02:39:59,822 --> 02:40:01,756
Go for it. Go.

2400
02:40:34,990 --> 02:40:37,254
Hey! What is wrong with the baby?

2401
02:40:38,193 --> 02:40:39,319
Why is baby crying?

2402
02:40:42,331 --> 02:40:43,798
Will you go to your papa?

2403
02:40:44,133 --> 02:40:46,795
Hey! Look at him. He is
not keeping quiet at all.

2404
02:40:47,202 --> 02:40:49,261
Go back to your mother.
- Come on, give him to me.

2405
02:40:49,338 --> 02:40:50,805
You will experience all
these things when you will have..

2406
02:40:50,873 --> 02:40:52,067
..your own baby. You will have
to take care of him yourself.

2407
02:40:52,141 --> 02:40:53,267
Hey! ls anybody listening to me?

2408
02:40:53,342 --> 02:40:55,003
Hey, just bring the things
required for the prayer ceremony.

2409
02:40:55,077 --> 02:40:56,135
We are getting late.

2410
02:40:56,211 --> 02:40:57,803
Hey! You only cut the ribbon.

2411
02:40:58,280 --> 02:40:59,338
Why are you screaming?

2412
02:40:59,415 --> 02:41:00,973
There is still five
more minutes, right?

2413
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:02,811
Look Miss Sameera, five..

2414
02:41:05,220 --> 02:41:09,816
Honey! After all, granny has
come from London right now.

2415
02:41:09,892 --> 02:41:11,223
We will ask her only
to do the inauguration.

2416
02:41:11,326 --> 02:41:12,816
The auspicious time is passing by.

2417
02:41:13,095 --> 02:41:16,826
You are looking so cute!
- Hey! For whom are waiting?

2418
02:41:16,999 --> 02:41:18,830
Hey! A special
guest is going to come.

2419
02:41:19,368 --> 02:41:20,960
Special guest!
- Yes.

2420
02:41:21,036 --> 02:41:23,163
Who is this special guest?
- He will come now.. - Here he is.

2421
02:41:24,239 --> 02:41:26,833
What happened?
- l think that he is here.

2422
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:47,194
There's a shower
of vibrant colours.

2423
02:41:49,264 --> 02:42:05,374
There's a shower of vibrant
colours, colouring everyone.

2424
02:42:06,048 --> 02:42:16,891
There's a shower of vibrant
colours, colouring everyone.

2425
02:42:19,294 --> 02:42:30,068
Delicious food was
served on a gold plate.

2426
02:42:31,073 --> 02:42:34,304
..that will be devoured
by the damsel's beloved.

2427
02:42:34,510 --> 02:42:46,911
There's a shower of vibrant
colours, colouring everyone.

2428
02:42:47,089 --> 02:42:52,083
Why?

2429
02:42:54,530 --> 02:42:55,929
lt is myself.

2430
02:42:59,268 --> 02:43:00,394
This is the limit, isn't it?

2431
02:43:00,469 --> 02:43:02,130
You all can buy the
tickets anytime and watch us.

2432
02:43:02,404 --> 02:43:03,928
But you will not give
me a chance to eat..

2433
02:43:04,006 --> 02:43:06,406
..your world
famous 'Gajar ka halwa'.

2434
02:43:08,343 --> 02:43:10,402
An ordinary man's dream
can be fulfilled so much!

2435
02:43:11,346 --> 02:43:12,938
l had not dreamed
about this dream also.

2436
02:43:13,348 --> 02:43:15,282
Everything is possible, my brother.

2437
02:43:15,484 --> 02:43:17,952
You should just have the
determination within you.

2438
02:43:19,221 --> 02:43:20,950
Come on, l will do the inauguration.

2439
02:43:21,023 --> 02:43:22,957
Where is the scissors?
- Here.

2440
02:43:26,562 --> 02:43:27,961
Hey! Come on, everybody please clap.

2441
02:43:30,632 --> 02:43:33,362
Ramji, has spice for everyone..

2442
02:43:35,237 --> 02:43:36,363
Everything is possible!

2443
02:43:36,438 --> 02:43:39,032
Ramji, has spice for everyone..
