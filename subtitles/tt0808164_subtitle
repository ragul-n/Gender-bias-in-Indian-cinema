1
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:55,256
''Good evening.
- Good evening, sir''

2
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,588
''l'm sorry, you can't go in.
- Why not?''

3
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:02,861
''Only couples are allowed, sir.
- But l have the invite''

4
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,832
''Sir, the invite clearly
says: ''Only for couples''

5
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,265
l'm very sorry

6
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,701
''Look, l've returned to
lndia after 5 years''

7
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:12,467
You must let me inside.. c'mon

8
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,598
''l'm sorry, sir''

9
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:18,370
''But those girls are being let in?
- The club has a policy, sir.''

10
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:20,277
Single girls are allowed. Single
men are not allowed.

11
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:25,275
Let me in buddy. lt will take
me a minute to get a partner

12
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,786
''l'm sorry, sir''

13
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:30,314
l've been very politely
requesting you to let me in

14
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:32,256
lt's no big deal! You
first invite people..

15
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:34,318
''and when they get here,
you insult them!''

16
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:36,295
''This is not done! No, no, no..''

17
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,422
Hey.. there you go!

18
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:44,396
Couldn't you have waited
a little longer?

19
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:47,808
He's with me.

20
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:51,972
ls Tony around? Mr Tony will
be here any moment. Please.

21
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:54,941
Shall we..?
- Sure!

22
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:00,452
''Wow, thanks! You are..?
- You don't know me''

23
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,512
But l heard everything out there

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,354
''l thought l ought to help, since
you've returned after so many years''

25
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:08,918
''l like helping people in trouble,
you know.. The helpful sort ?''

26
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,330
Hey! So why don't you
help me a little more?

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,732
''Have a drink with me, really''

28
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:16,360
l do have limits to being helpful

29
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,302
You'll have to find someone
else to have a drink with

30
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:21,365
''There's someone waiting for me.
- By the way, l'm Nikhil Kapoor''

31
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,411
Hi Nikhil.
- At least tell me your name

32
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:38,387
Oh this accursed love

33
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:43,564
it means the world to me

34
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:51,402
''Now its here, now its gone..''

35
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,332
''But as long as it is here,
its like glimpsing paradise''

36
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,878
Looks like he can't take
his eyes off you!

37
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:00,438
But he's hot.. don't you think ?

38
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,974
Poor Farhad!

39
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,912
Cute butt.. what do you say?

40
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,594
Guys and girls! Give a big hand
to the next singer of the night..

41
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:23,535
Nikhil Kapoor! All
the way from Boston!

42
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:27,836
Let's see if he has actually learnt
something at the business school!

43
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,968
''Thank you, thank you everyone''

44
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:34,638
''lf l'm here today, it's all
thanks to this beautiful girl''

45
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,749
''lf not for her, l might still
have been languishing outside.''

46
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:41,382
And l dedicate this song
to that beautiful girl..

47
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:44,516
who has flatly refused
to tell me her name

48
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:46,421
lf she indeed cares for me..

49
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:49,862
she'll surely join me

50
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:54,526
Pretty Woman..

51
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,769
don't break my heart

52
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:10,509
You who have stolen my heart..

53
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:15,445
''Don't shy away from me,''

54
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:23,420
Having changed my life.

55
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:24,556
Oh my God.

56
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,862
''l hope you will never
change, my love''

57
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,724
What's love if not
a misdeamenour..?

58
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:59,198
''a sweet poison, a suffering..?''

59
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:02,828
''an obsession, a high..?''

60
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,772
an aching suppressed in the heart?

61
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:12,536
''Come, let's sway..''

62
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:16,105
let's forget about the
travails of love..

63
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:19,720
let's give ourselves
up to be shattered..

64
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:21,584
come..

65
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:26,823
''Come, let's sway..''

66
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:30,526
let's forget about the
travails of love..

67
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,159
let's give ourselves
up to be shattered..

68
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,635
come..

69
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:39,571
come unto me..

70
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:08,599
''for a moment, only a fleeting
moment, is this wonderful light..''

71
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:15,702
''for a moment, only a fleeting
moment, is this life of ours''

72
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:18,608
So let's make the best of it..

73
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:22,576
let's care not for the world..

74
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,678
let's do what the occasion demands

75
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:30,622
''Come, forget who you are..''

76
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:34,954
''let's waltz, matching each
other step for step..''

77
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,623
seeking refuge in this
beautiful night..

78
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,963
''oh, join me, please''

79
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:45,595
''Come, help me drive away
my loneliness..''

80
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,302
let's make the best of what
Spring has to offer..

81
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,835
let me be drunk on your beauty..

82
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:54,609
come..

83
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,742
''come to me, please''

84
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,957
Thanks

85
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,962
''Hey.. take a picture, please.
- Okay''

86
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,930
''No, no, no.. thank you''

87
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,137
Thanks

88
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:22,672
You dance well.
- l was inspired

89
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:25,646
Are you trying to charm me..?

90
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:28,740
Thanks for the dance

91
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:33,242
''Hey.. ready to leave?
- You go, babes..''

92
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,946
l'll join you a little later.
- Okay

93
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:40,684
l'm sure you can stay on too..?
- Oh.. no

94
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,128
''May l ask you your name? No, no..''

95
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,101
may l ask you your name
all over again?

96
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,697
''Sure, you may.
- Ooh l love her..''

97
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:54,138
That's not being fair!

98
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,200
Did l ever mention anything
about being fair..?

99
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:00,881
''Helpful, yes. Fair? Hmm..?''

100
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:04,708
''Okay, so.. then, will you please
help me with your name?''

101
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:10,851
l told you. l'm undoubtedly
helpful..

102
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,984
but l have my limits

103
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:19,700
Listen.. will you tell me your
name the next time we meet?

104
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,825
''Oh sure, absolutely''

105
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:24,836
We're bound to run into each other
in this small city anyway

106
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,738
''When you truly desire something,
you are sometimes granted your wish''

107
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:31,234
Really?

108
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:41,950
So let's find out how
true your desire is!

109
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,062
''Hey.. what's up, bro?''

110
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,774
Hey! Rahul!

111
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,209
Nikhil!

112
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,909
How did you get here?
- By Air lndia

113
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,384
''Well, well.. you and
your sense of humour!''

114
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:13,750
''l mean, when, where, how..?''

115
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,085
Last night. l thought
l'd surprise you

116
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,715
Where else could l catch
you on Sunday but BBC?

117
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,090
The good ol' basketball court

118
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,753
''ln fact, l kept trying your
number all of last night''

119
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,127
But it was unreachable.
- What was l doing last night..?

120
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:26,166
Seem to have a memory lapse water?

121
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,793
Memory lapse! Been naughty eh!

122
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,804
How long do you plan to be
away from your U.S. of A ?

123
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,866
For.. ever

124
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:39,871
''Don't tell me!
- At least, l hope so''

125
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:42,814
l'm working for lnfo lnternational.
l hope it works out

126
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:45,784
America seems to have
been good to you

127
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,822
Look at those muscles! Good ya..
- Thanks

128
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,787
''lf it wasn't for the colour of your
hair, l'd have complimented you too''

129
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,986
Why? You can too fake
a compliment like me!

130
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:04,032
To lose both of them at one
go.. must've been hell

131
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,133
Suddenly l was an orphan

132
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:15,077
But maybe it was best
that they died together

133
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,882
''Everything here has changed,
hasn't it?''

134
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,113
But it's good to be back

135
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,866
''Why don't you move in with me?
- No, thanks''

136
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:38,905
The company's paying for my stay.

137
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:40,838
So.. what else has been
happening in your life?

138
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,966
As if l'd have asked you
to move in with me..

139
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:44,203
if there was something
happening in my life

140
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,839
''Anyway, all interesting women
seem to be with idiotic guys!''

141
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,045
''Hey, l forgot to tell you, l met
this wonderful babe last night''

142
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:55,885
''lf you see her, you won't be able
to take your eyes off her''

143
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:58,186
What's the name of this
wonderful babe of yours?

144
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,821
Well.. l'll let you
know as soon as

145
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,058
l got to know her name
and whereabouts

146
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,161
What a place!

147
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,232
''Know what, Manoj?''

148
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:11,999
There used to be a rocking club
in this very hotel earlier

149
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:17,003
How l wish l had a small flat here

150
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:18,840
Here..? By the sea?

151
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:22,371
Your electronic gadgets
would stop working.

152
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:23,882
''Air conditioners, TV, fridge..''

153
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,853
''Sweetheart, if l had the money to
buy a flat here.. then l would have''

154
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:32,120
''enough money to keep changing my
AC, TV, Car, fridge every month.''

155
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:35,321
Now what are these?
- The plans for the ground floor

156
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,886
Show me the plans for
the bowling alley first

157
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,092
''Deepak, fetch the bowling-alley
plans, will you?''

158
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:43,927
Ginger tea for you.
- Thank you

159
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:47,201
When are the soil reports of
the Versova site arriving?

160
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,037
By tomorrow afternoon.
- l see

161
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,340
Oh! Mr Farhad!
- Mr Farhad..?

162
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,005
Hi sweetheart!

163
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,280
How did your trip go?

164
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,944
l'm actually bored making these
trips to Switzerland all alone

165
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,115
lf only someone came along..
- Why don't you take Kabir along?

166
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,919
He's been dying to go to Switzerland

167
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,220
Kabir.. no way!

168
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:09,925
l'm told you guys have been
partying away merrily.. without me?

169
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,962
So All lndia Radio has
been tattling on us..?

170
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,432
Absolutely

171
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,961
Farhad.. l was about to call you up

172
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,975
l can't go out for lunch today.
- Anamika.. not again!

173
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:29,006
Tell me something.. why do you
always ditch me at the last moment?

174
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:32,985
''Besides, why do you need
to work on a Sunday?''

175
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,018
''Okay, l'll tell you what''

176
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,957
''To make up for this, l'll cook a
fantastic dinner for you. Promise!''

177
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,960
''Madam, the plans for the penthouse''

178
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:51,961
''Well then, Anamika..
l'll make a move now''

179
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:54,065
See you.
- See ya

180
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:08,283
C'mon!

181
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:13,084
''What's up, Mr Casanova..?''

182
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,060
Looks like your magic hasn't
worked this time?

183
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,023
lt's only been ten days..
she's acting a bit pricey

184
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,126
''You mean to say, she didn't
find you irresistible?''

185
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,098
lt's the first time such a
thing has happened to me

186
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:32,012
l just can't get her out of my mind

187
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:36,210
l wonder if l've finally
fallen in love

188
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:41,044
''l'm serious.
- She must be something, man!''

189
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,047
You'd never understand. You
bloody boring businessman!

190
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,386
Yeah..?

191
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,051
Hey Steve!

192
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:52,294
''l'm sorry.
- Late again, huh?''

193
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,065
The old man's making me slog really
hard. - You always have an excuse..

194
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,070
Cut down on your booze buddy.

195
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:03,066
''Meet Nikhil, my friend from Doon.
Steve.. the big shot builder''

196
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:06,169
My dad's the big shot builder. Not me

197
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,009
''l've heard so much about you.
- Me too, about you''

198
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:10,107
How's Mumbai treating you?
- Great

199
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:15,044
''Actually, not so great. Join us?''

200
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,059
The gentleman has fallen
in love.. true love

201
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,423
Shut up and shoot..

202
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:24,087
Hey.. why get into that mess?
Take it from me..

203
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:28,328
love is delusion. Women
invite trouble!

204
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:32,072
l don't know what Rahul has told
you about me.. but l'm not into guys

205
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:36,605
Hey guys.. let's go out tonight

206
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,770
''No, not tonight.
- Why not?''

207
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:41,314
Got to go to the German consulate
tonight.. you'll have to excuse us

208
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:42,440
''Oh, it had slipped my mind''

209
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,507
Will you pick me up from home?

210
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:46,382
l'll pick you up at eight. Be ready

211
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,511
l guess l'll go out alone

212
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:53,116
Babes.. call up Anticlock

213
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,191
Hi Tony!

214
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:07,438
''How're you? Sounds like the place
is rocking tonight, huh?''

215
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:12,101
So has the Boston dude been coming?

216
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:15,206
Yes!

217
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,482
''Been busy, you know''

218
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:23,079
We'll drop by in a couple
of days. So long..

219
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:26,422
''yeah, thanks, good night''

220
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:30,830
So he's still at it! Not the
types to give up easily

221
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:35,164
''Anamika, for all you know, he's
there with someone else''

222
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,138
No.. no!

223
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,174
We ought to take Farhad
there. What say?

224
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,141
Farhad..? Are you crazy?

225
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:45,776
He thinks he owns you

226
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:47,143
He'll kick up a fuss
if he goes there

227
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,183
C'mon.. just think of it.
lt'll be so much of fun

228
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:55,485
Anamika! You'll get into serious
trouble some day..

229
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,114
''Oh, whatever..
- l'm telling you''

230
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:59,455
Look at these jokers! Hello!

231
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:02,287
''Move it, guys!''

232
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:05,188
''What's happening, losers!''

233
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,568
Steve.. are you okay?

234
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,887
Have some water

235
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:41,292
Are you all right?

236
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,673
l'm fine

237
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:52,235
What's gotten into you nowadays?
You always seem to be upset

238
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,884
l'm okay now..
- You drank so much again..

239
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:02,217
''Skip the lecture, please! My
dad does enough of it anyway''

240
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:06,226
l had a few more than l could
handle at a party..

241
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:11,288
''so what's your problem?
- l have no problem, my car does''

242
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,697
''Okay, l'll clean it up tomorrow''

243
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:17,760
And l'll never ask you for
a ride again.. happy?

244
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:21,639
lf you are through with your
dramatics.. can we leave?

245
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:26,576
l know lra's having an affair

246
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,309
The thought is driving me crazy

247
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,587
She doesn't even let me touch her

248
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:43,286
You know she has a problem
with your drinking

249
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,526
lf l stop drinking she'll find
some other problem with me.

250
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:21,995
You're okay? You're sure you'll
manage? - Yeah.. l'm fine

251
00:19:57,371 --> 00:20:01,637
l'm sorry about this evening.
You know l love you..

252
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:06,372
We can discuss that in the morning.
l'm terribly sleepy

253
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:14,581
''Steve, l'm sleepy''

254
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:17,624
''You're my wife. Damn it!
- Please, Steve''

255
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:24,854
''What's your problem with me?
- You're hurting me, Steve!''

256
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,057
Bitch!

257
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:32,429
You.. you are drunk!

258
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:36,465
So?
- Steve! Please!

259
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:02,431
''Why do you hate me so much, lra?
Can't you see what it has done to me?''

260
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:08,875
lt doesn't make sense for
us to live together anymore

261
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:14,910
''Don't say that, lra.. you
know how much l love you''

262
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:24,445
The first time you hit me..

263
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,587
something died inside me.

264
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:35,697
l can't take this anymore

265
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:43,541
Let me go. Please.. let me go

266
00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:47,470
lf you leave me.. l'll kill myself

267
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:52,509
Please don't leave me

268
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,682
''Stop it, Steve.. stop it''

269
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,950
Stop it.. please! Stop it

270
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,555
Can't we give it another chance?

271
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:08,497
We have been happy together.
Haven't we?

272
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:09,626
You've been happy too

273
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:11,766
You know that

274
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:17,068
''l.. l don't love you anymore, Steve''

275
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:21,478
All l feel for you now is pity

276
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:41,694
Who is he?

277
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:53,843
Same old story of insecurities

278
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:58,712
''Unsuccessful career, dominating
father, a beautiful wife..''

279
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:01,117
she was a Miss lndia. She
gave up everything for him

280
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:04,021
Have you tried talking to Steve?
- lt's no good

281
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:08,789
There he is

282
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,863
Oh shit.. looks like he's had
another fight with his wife

283
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:17,730
Does his wife beat him up?

284
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,062
Very funny

285
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,140
Hi..
- ls everything fine?

286
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:33,075
What happened?
- l don't want to discuss this

287
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:34,620
''Everything's okay, l hope?
- l told you, Rahul''

288
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:35,746
l don't want to talk about it

289
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:42,585
l think the two of you ought to
consult a marriage counselor

290
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:47,590
That's for us to decide. Okay?

291
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:51,594
Nikhil..
- Hey Steve

292
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,831
How're you doing?

293
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:55,575
What happened to your forehead?
- Nothing

294
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:58,607
My wife has her own unique
way of expressing love

295
00:23:58,678 --> 00:24:01,704
That's scary!
- How was it with you last night?

296
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:04,807
Any luck? - l've gotten used
to the idea of waiting

297
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:07,547
The manager's become a friend and
the guy who stopped me outside..

298
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:10,613
has invited me over to dinner
tomorrow. Just my luck!

299
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,783
Let's all go there today

300
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:16,187
''For all you know, l might
change your fortunes?''

301
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,961
Great!

302
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:22,659
Did you have to pick up
a fight with Remo now?

303
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,601
''Forget it, will you? Today's
Valentine's Day''

304
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,798
''l'm sure l'll find someone.
- Good evening, Ma'am''

305
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:28,636
Mr Tony asked me to tell you that
your friend is here tonight

306
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,836
Now who is this friend..?

307
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:34,278
Shall we..?
- We shall

308
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,644
Well.. what's going on?

309
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,644
That's Anamika's latest fan.
- Anu.. what rubbish is that?

310
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:45,680
Have you invited someone else here?
- You know she's kidding! Let's go

311
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,926
l can barely see.. l've had
too much to drink again

312
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:52,624
Rubbish! You look absolutely
sober to me

313
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:55,726
Another drink.
- No!

314
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:59,670
''No, no, no! Stop it, Steve! lt's
my car you always mess up!''

315
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,798
Look!
- What?

316
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:03,870
There she is!

317
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,007
She's indeed..

318
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,710
''Hey, hang on.. She's mine''

319
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,748
Doesn't look like it!

320
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,023
Who's that?

321
00:25:20,093 --> 00:25:22,687
Looks like your girlfriend has
brought her Valentine along

322
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,132
Excuse me..

323
00:25:29,703 --> 00:25:30,761
Hi.
- Oh hi!

324
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:35,937
''Didn't l tell you? When you truly
desire something, you sometimes get it''

325
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,702
''Meet my friend, Farhad.
This is Nikhil Kapoor''

326
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:42,773
Hi.
- Hi

327
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:46,117
You forgot to mention one name

328
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:47,244
Nice try!

329
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:50,986
How much longer will you
make me wait? - Wait..?

330
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:52,684
''What's he talking about, Anamika?''

331
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,124
Anamika? (the nameless one)

332
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:57,959
No wonder it took me so long
to get to know your name

333
00:25:58,031 --> 00:25:59,692
''Oh, whatever.
- Join me for a drink?''

334
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,735
No thanks. We are with
friends. Let's go

335
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:06,169
May l have the pleasure of
dancing with you tonight?

336
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,139
''No.. no, not today. Some other time''

337
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,699
Maybe later tonight?
- Anu.. excuse us

338
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,905
l've waited so many days to meet you

339
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,005
Just a dance.. please?

340
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,378
''Hey.. chill out, dude''

341
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:23,081
Looks like you've got it all
wrong. Anu's here with me

342
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,420
''Farhad, he's only asking
me for a dance''

343
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:27,756
How could you..? You've
come here with me!

344
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:30,955
So..? God! You men!

345
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:34,762
''Anamika, please don't get upset.
You can always ask him to leave''

346
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,962
What did you say..?
- Why're you butting in?

347
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:40,438
''Get going, will you?
- Didn't you hear me?''

348
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,771
Don't you bloody interfere!
- What are you going to do? What?

349
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:46,801
''What the hell is going on, guys?
l'm just going home!''

350
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,780
Where are you going Anu? He's
the one who should leave.

351
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:51,009
''Why're you leaving?
- Leave me alone, Farhad''

352
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:53,780
''You heard her.. leave her alone.
- Just shut up, okay?''

353
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:55,753
''Guys, just stop it! l'm going
home! Enough is enough!''

354
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,790
Anu! You're going nowhere!
You're staying right here!

355
00:26:57,857 --> 00:26:59,119
Who d'you think you're yelling at?

356
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:00,716
Who're you yelling at?
- Don't touch me

357
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:02,819
What are you going to do?

358
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:16,469
l told you to keep
your hands off me!

359
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:19,842
Didn't l tell you not to touch me?
Didn't l? You wouldn't bloody listen!

360
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:20,971
''Farhad, just stop it..
- Shut up!''

361
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:22,810
l told you not to touch me..

362
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:24,144
Leave me!

363
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:36,819
Whom do you think you were pointing
the gun at? You dare..

364
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:38,158
Stop it!

365
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:42,827
Leave me..
- Get out of here!

366
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:44,836
Just leave me!

367
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:01,878
''You think you're a stud, eh?''

368
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:04,321
You pick up a fight
with a cop's son?

369
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,892
No.. please.. don't hit me!

370
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:28,178
l'll be a bit late today

371
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:51,832
The accused faces charges
of attempted murder..

372
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:56,842
illegal possession of arms and unruly
behaviour in the police lock up

373
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,572
The accused's bail plea is rejected

374
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:03,377
The accused will be held in police
custody till the next hearing

375
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:05,976
Go on

376
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:23,368
''No, not here.. go there''

377
00:29:29,943 --> 00:29:33,435
What are you looking at?
l don't dig pansies

378
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:37,246
''Since when, Chandu-bhai?''

379
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:43,946
Well? What have you done?
Rape? Murder?

380
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:45,919
Did you steal a car or rob a bank?

381
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,928
Have you done something

382
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,259
or was it your love for
us that brought you here?

383
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,993
There was a fight in a pub

384
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:05,070
The gun went off accidentally

385
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:06,941
Wow! Come here..

386
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:12,144
come on.. l really fancy
the pub-going types. C'mon!

387
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:21,153
Sit down

388
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:25,021
l'm Swamy

389
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:28,024
You?

390
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:31,436
Nikhil Kapoor

391
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:33,973
Dammit! You've even
got a fancy name!

392
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,375
''The Kapoor's are into the
movies, aren't they?''

393
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:42,675
You must have underworld
connections then..?

394
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:50,053
''Just kidding. You got a
Gandhi on you, l hope?''

395
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:56,121
Gandhi..?
- Gandhi. 500-rupee notes

396
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,055
You got to have them to stay here

397
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:05,027
l don't want to stay here.
l want to get out

398
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:07,698
As if we want to stay here forever!

399
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:13,035
There's a lot of waiting
here. Take a look..

400
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:19,041
l've been here for five
years. Killed my wife

401
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:23,487
Haven't been sentenced
yet. Still waiting

402
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:11,298
Just lie back quietly
and enjoy yourself

403
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,074
Leave me alone!

404
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,552
What's going on in here?

405
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:44,194
lt's him..
- Did l ask you?

406
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:48,073
''Jerk, you start throwing your
weight around the moment you arrive?''

407
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:50,336
''But l've done nothing!
- Shut up, asshole!''

408
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:54,142
A couple of days in solitary
confinement will straighten you out

409
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:18,330
Hey.. don't you scream

410
00:33:19,172 --> 00:33:21,106
Look after Chandu-bhai and
you'll be taken care of..

411
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,232
is that understood?

412
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,225
Hi Nikhil.. how are you?

413
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:52,203
Okay. Any good news?
When's the hearing?

414
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:55,169
The court has put off your
hearing to a later date

415
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,304
Farhad's father has
sent him to Australia

416
00:34:03,216 --> 00:34:05,184
Meet Rahul and ask him
to state in court..

417
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,879
that whatever happened that
day was just an accident

418
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:11,247
But he's not even willing to meet me

419
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:15,217
''ln any case, Rahul is in no state
to attend the court right now''

420
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,198
Give me your phone

421
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,605
Rahul..?

422
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:35,647
''l'm sorry, Rahul. l'm very sorry..''

423
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:39,514
''you know, l didn't do anything
deliberately..''

424
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:45,349
''Rahul, l need your help''

425
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:48,591
lf you don't come to the court..

426
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:50,388
Rahul..?

427
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:57,430
Your bail application
has been rejected again

428
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:02,230
The police claim that you
get into brawls in the jail

429
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:14,617
Can you get my cell changed?

430
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:16,245
''That won't be easy, Nikhil''

431
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,815
Farhad's dad is a top cop

432
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:22,693
l'll need a lot of money
to arrange everything

433
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:26,322
Ask my uncle to see me

434
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:29,632
l'll talk to him

435
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,465
l need some money too

436
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:47,383
''Pankaj, do something.
Please do something''

437
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:34,478
''Know what, Swamy? Sometimes l
think l'm forgetting everything''

438
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:42,485
''What it is like to have a decent
meal, sleep on a comfortable bed..''

439
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:46,761
to see a good looking woman

440
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:51,470
That's the beauty of jail life

441
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:55,496
''You gradually forget everything.
The good things, the bad things''

442
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:02,613
But l can never forget her.
- You love her a lot?

443
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,011
l've survived for one year
just thinking of her.

444
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:13,822
l don't even mind solitary
confinement anymore

445
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:17,928
''l just lie there, thinking of her''

446
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,490
She hasn't even come
once to meet you

447
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:27,995
''Come here, Swamy? To a jail?''

448
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:33,569
lt was nothing short of magic..

449
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:37,607
that moment when we set
eyes on each other

450
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:46,615
''l've got to get out of here, Swamy.
She must be waiting for me''

451
00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:57,559
What obsession is this..

452
00:39:57,636 --> 00:40:02,767
you are the one l think
of every moment

453
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:08,678
What obsession is this..

454
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:14,048
you are the one l think
of every moment

455
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:18,921
To you l owe my breath..

456
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:24,859
for you are my very life

457
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:30,769
Lonely are my nights without you..

458
00:40:30,836 --> 00:40:33,600
my days are sheer torture..

459
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:39,941
''lf you wish from by heart,
you will get it.''

460
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,616
Come to me now..

461
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:48,619
for l wish not to live
without you anymore

462
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:52,623
l know how l have lived
without you..

463
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:56,650
only l know how l have lived

464
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:03,865
How have l lived without you..

465
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:07,970
''Oh, what life without you..''

466
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:31,018
How have l lived without you..

467
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:35,624
''Oh, what life without you..''

468
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:41,662
How have l lived without you..

469
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,708
''Oh, what life without you..''

470
00:41:43,776 --> 00:41:46,711
Hey..

471
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:49,680
the officer has sent
for you. Hurry up

472
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,010
Move it!

473
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:53,677
Since when have you been
working for this NGO?

474
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:59,681
''Nikhil, meet Mrs Malhotra.
She works with an NGO..''

475
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:04,218
and wants to ask you some questions
about your case.. sit down

476
00:42:05,698 --> 00:42:09,361
Hello Nikhil.. sit down

477
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:22,807
''Nikhil Kapoor, MBA, Boston
University. Right?''

478
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:32,824
''February 14, 2003. You and Farhad
were arrested for brawling''

479
00:42:36,462 --> 00:42:39,954
A pistol was recovered from you

480
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:44,726
You are accused of
firing at Rahul..

481
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:49,407
you even used force on Anamika.

482
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,719
Can l have a word with him alone?

483
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,083
Sure

484
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:12,754
''Nikhil, l will try to help you..''

485
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:16,758
but you'll have to cooperate with me

486
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:22,807
Why do you want to help me?

487
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:28,879
Because it's my job to help
under-trial prisoners like you

488
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:34,309
Can you get me out of here?

489
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:37,017
l can surely give it a try

490
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,815
What do you want to know?

491
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:26,828
You can't even imagine
what jail food is like

492
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:28,395
l can

493
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:44,254
Any idea where Anamika
and Rahul are?

494
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:50,852
And Steve? He was there too.
He saw everything

495
00:44:52,865 --> 00:44:57,893
Remember Nikhil.. you're
only out on bail

496
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:02,500
Don't do something that lands
you in trouble again

497
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:15,319
''l'll have to find Anamika,
whatever happens''

498
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,984
''Have you thought of what you're
going to do, or where you'll stay?''

499
00:45:22,895 --> 00:45:28,231
l can't go to my Uncle. l could
sense it from his tone

500
00:45:29,902 --> 00:45:33,895
l had called him up to tell
him about my release..

501
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:38,866
l'll manage something.
- There's this home for the aged

502
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:43,308
You could work there as
a volunteer for some days

503
00:45:43,382 --> 00:45:45,077
lt'll provide you a place to stay

504
00:45:59,932 --> 00:46:01,160
Come

505
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:02,962
Good evening everybody

506
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:05,995
How're you feeling?

507
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,135
''Good evening, Mrs Sharma''

508
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,935
Hey.. come on in.. come.
lt's just like home..

509
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:16,947
Hi lra..
- Hello Mrs Fernandes

510
00:46:18,016 --> 00:46:21,247
Whose cards are you reading today?
- My own!

511
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,951
l'm going to land something
special today

512
00:46:24,022 --> 00:46:28,152
''Really? Mrs Fernandes,
meet my friend. Nikhil''

513
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:30,627
Hello young man..
- Hello Mrs Fernandes

514
00:46:30,696 --> 00:46:32,960
Nikhil will be staying
here for a few days

515
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:36,967
''Oh! So you're my ''something
special''?''

516
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:41,963
The other oldies are all going
to be jealous of me now!

517
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:40,360
Hey Tony.. very good!

518
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:47,363
''Well played, guys''

519
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:56,207
Hi Rahul

520
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,347
Rahul..

521
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:13,657
l had no clue..

522
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:18,093
Have you ever thought
of anyone but yourself?

523
00:48:23,075 --> 00:48:27,239
l tried my best to contact
you. You know that

524
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:34,080
''lt was an accident, Rahul. l'm sorry''

525
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:36,086
''Go away, Nikhil''

526
00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:41,116
Don't say that. l'm
a friend of yours

527
00:48:42,094 --> 00:48:44,722
''You know, l'd never even
dream of harming you''

528
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,061
l've been rotting in
prison for 3 years

529
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:54,094
3 years? l'll have to spend
a lifetime in this wheelchair

530
00:48:58,176 --> 00:49:01,145
l know you didn't fire
at me deliberately

531
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:04,105
But you were responsible
for whatever happened

532
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:16,789
Please Nikhil.. don't ever
try to meet me again

533
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:26,127
Rahul.. any idea where Anamika is?

534
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:35,305
Hi..
- Hi

535
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,474
What's up? You look upset

536
00:49:40,152 --> 00:49:42,211
l met Rahul

537
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,289
Because of me..

538
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:51,158
''Nikhil, what happened was an
accident. lt wasn't your fault''

539
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:57,294
Maybe it was my fault too

540
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,263
l'm sorry.. water?

541
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:02,363
''Yeah, sure''

542
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:08,169
''l got some stuff for you. On my
way back, my car broke down''

543
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:10,840
''lmagine, just five minutes away''

544
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,180
You ought to have phoned me.
l'd have carried all this

545
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:16,482
''No, it's okay.. thanks''

546
00:50:17,923 --> 00:50:19,220
lra.. all this stuff..?

547
00:50:22,928 --> 00:50:25,192
''Nikhil, how do you find it here?''

548
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,191
You've gotten to be great
friends with Mrs Fernandes.

549
00:50:31,203 --> 00:50:35,196
She's very sweet. lra..
so much of stuff..

550
00:50:35,273 --> 00:50:37,605
what is this?
- You like it?

551
00:50:39,211 --> 00:50:41,338
''Yeah, l like it. Thank you''

552
00:50:41,947 --> 00:50:45,212
l thought l'd atleast
make your room liveable

553
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:48,218
''Liveable? Don't forget, l've
spent 3 years in jail''

554
00:50:50,222 --> 00:50:56,855
Can l thank you by taking you
out to dinner? Please..?

555
00:51:06,238 --> 00:51:07,432
Hi

556
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:12,540
Why're you sitting in the dark?

557
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,637
Just like that.
- Oh my God..

558
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:18,279
the traffic was a killer as usual!

559
00:51:20,252 --> 00:51:25,781
But guess what? Our lTC
presentation was simply superb

560
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:27,290
We'll definitely bag the contract..

561
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,423
''and maybe l'll get another
promotion. - Damn good, Anu''

562
00:51:33,498 --> 00:51:36,262
l know. We can then go to
Spain for our honeymoon

563
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,235
l met Sunita over lunch today

564
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:44,305
We've even decided on a menu for
our engagement. How about that?

565
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:50,277
Why do you leave me out of
everything? - My sweety..

566
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:53,909
l don't want to bother
you with small details

567
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,510
But it happens to be
my engagement too

568
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:00,258
Why must you say such things?

569
00:52:01,293 --> 00:52:02,590
l'm sorry

570
00:52:05,297 --> 00:52:11,702
Remember..? lt's exactly
3 years since we met?

571
00:52:24,316 --> 00:52:26,477
Remember Nikhil?

572
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:29,446
How can l ever forget him?

573
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,352
''You liked him, didn't you?''

574
00:52:34,326 --> 00:52:36,294
What kind of a question is that?

575
00:52:37,062 --> 00:52:38,996
All women used to
find him attractive

576
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:43,324
Well! At least he used to think so!

577
00:52:44,336 --> 00:52:46,395
But why talk about him?

578
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,364
Let's go out to dinner somewhere

579
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:57,907
''l'm terribly tired, Anu.
- Okay..''

580
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:01,712
''in that case, let's order
something at home. Pizza?''

581
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:06,723
l'm not hungry at all. Seriously.

582
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:12,325
''Don't be a spoilsport now!
- No, seriously.. l'm very sleepy''

583
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:14,730
l'll go to sleep

584
00:53:16,368 --> 00:53:20,998
Well.. l guess l'm
going to be off then

585
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:42,519
''Okay.. thanks, Nikhil.
- You're welcome''

586
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,392
l'm sorry we got so late. l had
no idea it would be so crowded

587
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:48,691
''Actually, l had forgotten
that it's Valentine's Day''

588
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:51,961
See you tomorrow.
- See you

589
00:53:54,406 --> 00:53:56,374
Bye.
- Bye.. good night

590
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:07,783
You.. weren't you supposed
to be back tomorrow?

591
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,480
l thought l'd give you a surprise

592
00:54:12,424 --> 00:54:13,652
But..

593
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:18,555
had a nice evening?

594
00:54:20,432 --> 00:54:22,457
l'm talking to you!

595
00:54:25,437 --> 00:54:27,462
Maybe you haven't noticed

596
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:30,641
l've been waiting to
have dinner with you

597
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:42,420
Who was it?

598
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:48,420
''What difference does it make, Steve?''

599
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:58,459
''You who have stolen my heart..''

600
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:08,845
''Don't shy away from me,''''

601
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:14,475
''Having changed my life.''

602
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:52,854
Hi babes! What's up? Partying?

603
00:55:52,924 --> 00:55:55,722
''No, l'm at home.
- What!''

604
00:55:55,794 --> 00:55:57,489
You're at home on Valentine's Day?
What's the matter with you?

605
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,498
That's just what l wanted
to talk to you about

606
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,534
''ln other words, you've given
number 13 the royal ditch!''

607
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:08,504
''No babes, this is serious''

608
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:14,501
l think.. l'm falling in love

609
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:19,209
What?! l'm coming right over!
Bye for now.. bye

610
00:57:42,634 --> 00:57:43,692
Anamika?

611
00:57:55,647 --> 00:57:56,807
Nikhil?

612
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:02,643
Weren't you in jail?

613
00:58:03,655 --> 00:58:05,646
l've been granted bail

614
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:10,821
How are you?

615
00:58:11,663 --> 00:58:13,631
l've been looking for you

616
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:21,333
''And l thought, where else could
l find you, but here..''

617
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:23,704
''this place, where we had first met''

618
00:58:25,677 --> 00:58:29,613
l suddenly feel as if the last
3 years didn't happen at all..

619
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:32,172
as if we've just met

620
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:34,709
How have you been?

621
00:58:37,689 --> 00:58:39,020
l'm good

622
00:58:40,692 --> 00:58:44,355
l got to be going.
- Please wait..

623
00:58:46,431 --> 00:58:49,025
l've waited for this moment
for 3 long years

624
00:58:50,702 --> 00:58:52,829
So please don't talk of leaving

625
00:58:53,705 --> 00:58:58,733
l thought of you every moment
l spent in jail..

626
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:01,974
Nikhil..

627
00:59:04,716 --> 00:59:08,049
everything has changed..
- Nothing has changed

628
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,917
''Else, you wouldn't have
been here today''

629
00:59:16,728 --> 00:59:17,888
l..

630
00:59:20,732 --> 00:59:23,030
''l'm in love with Rahul, Nikhil''

631
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:31,003
What!

632
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:35,810
We're getting engaged on
the 24th of this month

633
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,910
You must be joking

634
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:53,795
''That one shot you fired changed
everything, Nikhil''

635
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:02,871
Anamika..?
- Hi

636
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:07,775
''Hi. Mom, Dad.. that's Anamika''

637
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:09,745
''Come, dear. Sit down''

638
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:20,213
''Actually, l wanted to come
much earlier. But..''

639
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:23,260
What a pleasant surprise

640
01:00:24,796 --> 01:00:27,424
l didn't think you'd come at all

641
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,793
''Rahul, for whatever has happened..''

642
01:00:33,538 --> 01:00:38,134
l.. l just wanted to say sorry

643
01:00:40,812 --> 01:00:45,112
l always told you to
stay away from Nikhil

644
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,817
Please.. c'mon

645
01:01:15,847 --> 01:01:17,974
l'll be going home next week

646
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,978
May l come..? To take you home?

647
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,352
You don't have to bother.
Mom and Dad are here

648
01:01:25,857 --> 01:01:28,826
Would you mind.. if l came?

649
01:01:34,866 --> 01:01:43,001
''You know, Anamika.. it'll be difficult
to live with so much of pity''

650
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,905
l'm not pitying you-

651
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:50,877
l hold myself equally responsible
for whatever has happened. And so..

652
01:01:52,884 --> 01:01:55,148
l've been trying to
say that l'm sorry

653
01:01:56,888 --> 01:02:01,450
But looks like l haven't been
able to say it properly

654
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:07,228
''Thursday morning, ten o'clock.''

655
01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:18,274
l took Rahul home. l used
to go to meet him sometimes

656
01:02:19,911 --> 01:02:21,902
l had started liking him

657
01:02:23,915 --> 01:02:25,041
And then one day..

658
01:02:26,918 --> 01:02:28,909
we were in love

659
01:02:34,926 --> 01:02:36,985
l met Rahul this afternoon

660
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,125
He didn't say a word to me

661
01:02:45,937 --> 01:02:47,336
This afternoon..?

662
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,110
Anamika..

663
01:03:01,953 --> 01:03:04,285
l won't be able to live without you

664
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:06,253
Nikhil..

665
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,951
You actually pity him

666
01:03:11,963 --> 01:03:14,955
And you're mistaking
that pity for love

667
01:03:27,979 --> 01:03:29,139
Anamika..

668
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:32,973
Anamika..

669
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:56,030
''Wow! Old songs were so great,
weren't they?''

670
01:03:57,108 --> 01:04:01,010
''What lyrics, what tunes.. - What's
the problem with today's lyrics?''

671
01:04:01,078 --> 01:04:03,046
Kick up a fuss.. my heart
goes ding-dong..

672
01:04:03,114 --> 01:04:06,015
''Sure, tell me about it.
Ding-dong indeed''

673
01:04:07,018 --> 01:04:11,250
l have some nice wine
- imported

674
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:13,313
Wine? No thank you

675
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,052
Pamper me so much
and l'll become fat

676
01:04:15,126 --> 01:04:18,186
Become..? What do you think
you are right now?

677
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:21,163
Excuse me! Do you mean l'm fat?

678
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,996
And what do you have to
say about yourself?

679
01:04:25,036 --> 01:04:29,336
Lazy bum! You sit in that
chair all day and..

680
01:04:35,046 --> 01:04:39,176
''l'm sorry, that's not what l meant''

681
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:42,451
You did

682
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:46,285
You know l didn't mean it

683
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:49,053
''And you're right too. l'm getting
fat, sitting around all day''

684
01:04:51,062 --> 01:04:52,154
Rahul..

685
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:59,331
''Rahul, l..''

686
01:05:01,072 --> 01:05:03,199
oh my God!

687
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,411
All this..?

688
01:05:10,815 --> 01:05:13,340
lt's this lazy bum who has
done all this for you

689
01:05:14,085 --> 01:05:18,351
''l can't believe this. All
this, on your own..?''

690
01:05:18,823 --> 01:05:21,018
Can't be helped! Some
people are so stingy..

691
01:05:21,092 --> 01:05:24,186
they don't give their friends
a treat even on their birthdays

692
01:05:26,097 --> 01:05:27,496
Happy birthday

693
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:43,103
Have l done something wrong..?

694
01:05:46,117 --> 01:05:49,109
So.. why're you crying?

695
01:05:51,122 --> 01:05:54,216
Because l'm happy.
- What?

696
01:05:56,127 --> 01:05:57,253
Because l'm happy !

697
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:02,122
Looks like we'll have to celebrate
your birthday again next month

698
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,402
C'mon..

699
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:14,441
stop crying..

700
01:06:15,146 --> 01:06:17,307
and give me that gorgeous smile

701
01:06:18,149 --> 01:06:21,380
Love now smiles..

702
01:06:21,452 --> 01:06:25,388
''in you, l have found
a new lease of life''

703
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:30,150
l lived in the shadows..

704
01:06:30,895 --> 01:06:34,456
l led a lifeless existence
until l met you

705
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:43,197
Romance smiles..

706
01:06:43,274 --> 01:06:47,176
''in you, l have found life''

707
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:51,637
l lived in the shadows..

708
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:55,352
l led a lifeless existence
until l met you

709
01:06:56,187 --> 01:07:00,123
There were things l couldn't
dare imagine..

710
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:04,218
''and now, they're all l dream of''

711
01:07:04,295 --> 01:07:08,664
Why mustn't my heart crave then?

712
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:12,369
''Why mustn't it pine,
thirst for you?''

713
01:07:13,437 --> 01:07:17,305
''Why mustn't it pine,
thirst for you?''

714
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:38,252
Little did l know..

715
01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:42,459
that my prayers would bear fruit

716
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:46,232
That such a thing would
ever be possible..

717
01:07:46,971 --> 01:07:51,203
l'd have you face to face with me

718
01:07:52,243 --> 01:07:56,270
Look in my eyes..

719
01:07:56,347 --> 01:08:00,374
you'll see just how
crazy l am about you

720
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:08,483
''Why does the heart crave,
yearn, ache for you?''

721
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,825
''Why does the heart crave,
yearn, ache for you?''

722
01:08:32,283 --> 01:08:33,750
Rahul..?

723
01:08:36,287 --> 01:08:38,312
Did you meet Nikhil today?

724
01:08:47,298 --> 01:08:50,825
ls that why you asked me all those
strange questions this evening?

725
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:56,467
Meeting Nikhil today..

726
01:08:57,308 --> 01:09:03,474
drove me a bit crazy. l'm sorry

727
01:09:11,055 --> 01:09:15,992
l met Nikhil at Anticlock today

728
01:09:30,341 --> 01:09:33,310
What were you doing there?

729
01:09:35,346 --> 01:09:36,836
l..

730
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:40,482
''l was on my to Sunita's place, Rahul''

731
01:09:41,352 --> 01:09:43,320
As l drove past Anticlock..

732
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:46,356
''l don't know why, but l just
walked in to take a look''

733
01:09:50,361 --> 01:09:56,459
But isn't the place
shut for repairs?

734
01:09:56,533 --> 01:10:00,299
''l know, Rahul. l don't know why,
but it just slipped my mind''

735
01:10:00,371 --> 01:10:04,501
Sunita and l used to hang
out there a lot earlier

736
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:06,406
lsn't that also where
you first met Nikhil?

737
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:24,657
You used to like him a lot too

738
01:10:24,728 --> 01:10:27,390
l see! So this is what
you are so upset about!

739
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,369
''lt's hardly your fault, Anamika''

740
01:10:33,404 --> 01:10:37,397
''After all, l can't even
make love to you''

741
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:40,910
''Don't talk nonsense, Rahul! Please!''

742
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:50,410
Be honest with me. Didn't
you really like him?

743
01:10:52,423 --> 01:10:55,415
What's wrong with you..?
You're being mean!

744
01:11:01,432 --> 01:11:02,831
Tell me something

745
01:11:04,435 --> 01:11:07,063
why do you love me so much?

746
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:11,931
Can you tell me why
you love me so much?

747
01:11:16,447 --> 01:11:21,851
lt was difficult for me
to meet Nikhil today

748
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:29,450
''And instead of understanding
that, you're..''

749
01:11:31,462 --> 01:11:34,727
do you love me at all?

750
01:12:13,504 --> 01:12:15,472
''Sir, phone for you.
- Who is it?''

751
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,836
Anu didi

752
01:12:21,512 --> 01:12:22,877
Hi

753
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:27,575
The flowers are beautiful. Thanks

754
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:30,586
Flowers? What flowers?

755
01:12:30,654 --> 01:12:32,554
The ones you sent me

756
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:34,853
''l sent no flowers, Anu''

757
01:12:35,526 --> 01:12:36,584
Someone else must have

758
01:12:39,263 --> 01:12:42,027
Maybe it was a mistake then..

759
01:12:42,266 --> 01:12:45,531
there's someone at the door. Maybe
to take the flowers back

760
01:12:45,602 --> 01:12:47,797
l'll call you later

761
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,553
''Forgive me for the intrusion,
but please do not be so upset''

762
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:16,599
You look nicer when you smile

763
01:13:33,684 --> 01:13:36,778
Hi..
- Hi.. come

764
01:13:37,588 --> 01:13:40,580
''What happened, lra? All well? You
didn't come to the home today''

765
01:13:42,593 --> 01:13:45,153
There's been a slight problem

766
01:13:45,596 --> 01:13:48,793
My husband saw you dropping me home

767
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,592
He.. he thinks..

768
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:55,799
he's got it all wrong

769
01:13:57,608 --> 01:13:59,701
l could talk to him

770
01:14:01,612 --> 01:14:08,609
No. You don't know him..
he's a bit unstable

771
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:13,021
He could do anything

772
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:19,926
''May l ask you something, lra?
l hope you don't mind''

773
01:14:21,632 --> 01:14:25,124
Why are you with him? Why
don't you leave him?

774
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,633
''l gave up everything for him.
My career, my family..''

775
01:14:36,647 --> 01:14:39,639
we used to love each other so much

776
01:14:40,651 --> 01:14:43,643
And then
- what happened? - l don't know

777
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:51,628
''Our lives are pretty complicated,
aren't they?''

778
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:57,765
We'll look for a new place
for you tomorrow

779
01:14:58,402 --> 01:15:00,962
''Till then, l'll come there
only once in a while''

780
01:15:03,674 --> 01:15:05,665
Gotta leave now. Bye

781
01:15:07,411 --> 01:15:10,972
''No.. stay right here.
And be careful, please''

782
01:15:33,704 --> 01:15:35,729
l thought you didn't ever
want to meet me again

783
01:15:40,711 --> 01:15:42,770
Why're you bothering Anamika?

784
01:15:47,718 --> 01:15:51,711
''When l first saw you in the
wheelchair, l felt very bad''

785
01:15:54,725 --> 01:15:56,056
But not anymore

786
01:15:56,727 --> 01:15:59,059
Anamika means everything to me

787
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,028
You knew how much l loved her

788
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,727
And you knew there was nothing
between the two of you either

789
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:11,731
And now.. Anamika and
l love each other a lot

790
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:15,209
''lf you really loved her,
you'd have gone away''

791
01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:20,239
But you've found yourself a
pretty nurse for a lifetime

792
01:16:26,757 --> 01:16:31,421
Oh yes.. do tell Anu that she's
looking very beautiful today

793
01:16:31,762 --> 01:16:34,754
Hello chef!
- Hi

794
01:16:36,767 --> 01:16:40,931
Where's Narayan today?
- He had something to do in Colaba

795
01:16:41,004 --> 01:16:42,904
He hasn't returned yet

796
01:16:43,774 --> 01:16:46,140
''l felt hungry, so l thought l'd..''

797
01:16:46,777 --> 01:16:50,042
You ought to have told me. l'd have
picked up something on my way

798
01:16:51,782 --> 01:16:54,808
''l can't spend my life
waiting for you, can l?''

799
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:03,089
Why're you angry with me?

800
01:17:06,797 --> 01:17:08,992
Nikhil was right

801
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,100
You're really looking
beautiful today

802
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,866
So you met him again?

803
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:21,869
Rahul.. are you okay?

804
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:34,222
''Just leave me alone, okay? Please''

805
01:17:37,828 --> 01:17:40,456
l don't know what happens to me.

806
01:17:41,832 --> 01:17:44,824
''What have l done, Rahul?''

807
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:50,005
l'm sorry

808
01:17:54,845 --> 01:17:58,042
See what happens to me
when you're not around

809
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:03,012
You still can't bring
yourself to trust me

810
01:18:03,854 --> 01:18:08,018
That's not true! lt's just that..

811
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:11,857
l can't stop myself from thinking
about Nikhil and you

812
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:24,865
Are you sure you want to marry
someone who's lusting after Nikhil?

813
01:18:53,904 --> 01:18:55,064
Hello..

814
01:18:55,906 --> 01:18:57,567
hello?

815
01:19:01,912 --> 01:19:02,970
Hello!

816
01:19:45,956 --> 01:19:47,116
Nikhil..?

817
01:19:48,959 --> 01:19:50,927
ls it hurting a lot?

818
01:19:51,962 --> 01:19:53,122
What?

819
01:19:53,964 --> 01:19:57,923
Your foot.. does it hurt a lot?

820
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,961
How.. how do you know?

821
01:21:07,037 --> 01:21:09,005
l've decided to move to Dehradun

822
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,270
What will you do there?

823
01:21:13,043 --> 01:21:17,480
l have a friend there who has
got me a job in a school

824
01:21:18,048 --> 01:21:22,314
You need any help from me?
- Thanks

825
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:26,048
l've found a place for you.
lt's a bit far away..

826
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:29,649
but it'll do for now. You
can move in tomorrow

827
01:21:34,064 --> 01:21:37,727
''Thank you, lra. You've really
done so much for me''

828
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:41,401
l'm really indebted to you

829
01:21:42,806 --> 01:21:46,037
l wish l could go away
someplace like you

830
01:21:47,077 --> 01:21:49,102
But my life is right here..

831
01:21:51,081 --> 01:21:52,480
with her

832
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:56,382
Thanks again

833
01:22:06,096 --> 01:22:07,154
Shit!

834
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:12,159
Hello..

835
01:22:14,104 --> 01:22:15,332
Hello?

836
01:22:21,111 --> 01:22:22,271
Nikhil..?

837
01:22:22,345 --> 01:22:26,145
So he even calls you up now?

838
01:22:26,216 --> 01:22:28,150
''Oh stop it, Rahul!
There you go again!''

839
01:22:28,852 --> 01:22:33,152
He keeps calling you and you
won't even inform the police

840
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:40,222
Or is it that you've been
waiting for his calls?

841
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,165
Hi.
- Hi

842
01:22:52,242 --> 01:22:54,176
l'm making thukpa for dinner

843
01:22:58,148 --> 01:23:01,140
''Care for some tea?
- Yeah, sure''

844
01:23:06,156 --> 01:23:10,115
l saw the doctor today.
He wants to meet you.

845
01:23:11,161 --> 01:23:14,153
l've already told you.
l don't want a child

846
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:21,160
''l know, because of me..''

847
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:25,505
but..

848
01:23:27,177 --> 01:23:30,578
l don't have the courage
to lose another child

849
01:23:32,182 --> 01:23:37,518
''Besides, l don't want my child to
be brought up by an alcoholic''

850
01:23:37,587 --> 01:23:39,248
You know l'm trying my best

851
01:23:42,192 --> 01:23:47,289
''lf we have a child, maybe..
- lt's too late''

852
01:23:47,931 --> 01:23:52,231
''Steve, a child is not the solution
to a failed marriage''

853
01:24:15,225 --> 01:24:18,490
You can at least try lra? Please..?

854
01:24:19,229 --> 01:24:21,720
Haven't l tried at all?

855
01:24:26,236 --> 01:24:29,672
lt's because of you
that l drink so much

856
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:33,766
So why don't you leave me?

857
01:24:35,245 --> 01:24:37,805
''l can never leave you, lra''

858
01:24:38,982 --> 01:24:41,246
Nor can l let you leave me ever

859
01:24:45,255 --> 01:24:46,722
l want a child

860
01:24:50,994 --> 01:24:53,656
''C'mon Anu.. l've said
sorry, haven't l?''

861
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:57,222
Stop being angry now.
- l'm not angry

862
01:25:02,272 --> 01:25:04,297
You are

863
01:25:08,278 --> 01:25:11,645
This is for you

864
01:25:15,285 --> 01:25:19,688
''Wow! Quite nice, thanks''

865
01:25:22,292 --> 01:25:24,385
You're still angry with me?

866
01:25:39,309 --> 01:25:44,303
Can l.. bribe you?

867
01:27:54,444 --> 01:27:55,502
For you

868
01:27:56,446 --> 01:27:58,380
Nikhil..

869
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:05,444
all this..?
- lt's for you

870
01:28:05,521 --> 01:28:06,579
You've gone mad!

871
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,487
Just leave from here! Now!

872
01:28:45,495 --> 01:28:49,727
Nikhil.. you can't force
yourself on me like this

873
01:28:58,508 --> 01:28:59,634
Why not?

874
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:05,504
Are you afraid that you
might start desiring me?

875
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,044
Shit!

876
01:29:18,528 --> 01:29:20,860
This is not how..

877
01:29:23,533 --> 01:29:25,558
this is not how l wished to have you

878
01:29:34,644 --> 01:29:36,839
How you've made me stoop

879
01:30:03,573 --> 01:30:06,633
Manoharji.. hello!
- Hello

880
01:30:07,577 --> 01:30:09,602
''This is Nikhil, my friend.
- Hello''

881
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:12,807
Sorry you had to wait. There
was a lot of traffic

882
01:30:15,585 --> 01:30:17,610
She wouldn't do that

883
01:30:18,588 --> 01:30:19,919
Here you are

884
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:22,751
Thank you.
- Thank you

885
01:31:03,994 --> 01:31:06,224
''Why does it happen this way, lra?''

886
01:31:07,998 --> 01:31:12,025
Whenever someone gets close to me..

887
01:31:14,004 --> 01:31:16,302
l end up losing that person

888
01:31:21,011 --> 01:31:24,344
''Nikhil, there's something
l haven't told you''

889
01:31:25,015 --> 01:31:30,282
''l'm leaving tomorrow and before
l leave, l wanted to tell you..''

890
01:31:35,025 --> 01:31:37,391
that Steve is my husband

891
01:31:41,765 --> 01:31:48,193
What! Why didn't you
tell me that before?

892
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:57,037
Try and remember what happened
at the Anticlock that night

893
01:32:02,052 --> 01:32:04,111
Nikhil.. please!

894
01:32:11,061 --> 01:32:13,052
lt was Steve who fired the shot

895
01:32:15,065 --> 01:32:17,090
What are you talking about?
The pistol was in my hand

896
01:32:19,069 --> 01:32:21,731
The pistol was in your hand..

897
01:32:23,073 --> 01:32:25,268
but it was Steve who fired

898
01:32:26,076 --> 01:32:31,070
Don't mess with me! Steve..
leave me alone!

899
01:32:41,091 --> 01:32:44,083
Steve..? But why?

900
01:32:52,102 --> 01:32:53,160
lra..?

901
01:32:55,105 --> 01:32:59,439
What happened? Where's Steve?

902
01:33:02,112 --> 01:33:03,170
What happened?

903
01:33:07,117 --> 01:33:08,311
Tell me

904
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:14,250
l went to see a friend today

905
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:18,726
He used to study with
me in the same college

906
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:23,190
l even told Steve before going

907
01:33:24,868 --> 01:33:29,168
''When l got home, Steve
was very upset''

908
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:32,472
He.. he was drunk

909
01:33:33,143 --> 01:33:39,139
''And suddenly he turned violent.
l mean, he started..''

910
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:45,349
''lt's okay. l'll look for him,
okay? Come.. come on''

911
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:49,420
Thanks

912
01:33:52,162 --> 01:33:55,427
l.. l'm extremely sorry

913
01:34:02,172 --> 01:34:05,266
Sit down.
- Thanks.. thanks so much

914
01:34:06,176 --> 01:34:08,337
l'll fetch some water for you.
- Yeah

915
01:34:16,186 --> 01:34:20,282
''Did l hurt you, baby?
l'm so sorry, lra!''

916
01:34:20,357 --> 01:34:23,485
Please..
- l don't know what comes over me

917
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,690
l start getting weird ideas and..
l can't control myself anymore

918
01:34:27,764 --> 01:34:29,391
''Please Steve..
- Let her be, Steve..''

919
01:34:31,201 --> 01:34:32,862
she's hurt

920
01:34:32,936 --> 01:34:34,631
''Rahul, what brings you here?''

921
01:34:36,206 --> 01:34:37,468
You are the one..

922
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:42,171
who invited me to lunch.
Maybe you forgot

923
01:34:43,213 --> 01:34:47,877
''Sorry, man l don't know
what's happening today''

924
01:34:48,218 --> 01:34:56,353
l.. l'm really sorry about this
lt's okay. Some other time

925
01:35:18,248 --> 01:35:20,876
Hi.
- Hi.. what a pleasant surprise

926
01:35:22,252 --> 01:35:24,277
''Steve's away in Amsterdam, isn't he?''

927
01:35:24,354 --> 01:35:27,585
Yes..
- l see. ls everything okay?

928
01:35:27,991 --> 01:35:30,425
Maybe l shouldn't have
come here on my own

929
01:35:30,494 --> 01:35:35,261
''No, that's not what
l meant. Come on in''

930
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:44,365
Come Sit down

931
01:35:44,441 --> 01:35:46,432
''Give me a second, okay?''

932
01:35:55,285 --> 01:35:57,310
l'm sorry.. you were busy working

933
01:35:58,288 --> 01:35:59,619
That's okay

934
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,315
Narayan.. get some water

935
01:36:05,295 --> 01:36:08,389
''What will you have? Tea, coffee.. ?''

936
01:36:08,465 --> 01:36:11,298
''No, no thanks.
- Why not? Have something''

937
01:36:14,304 --> 01:36:17,296
Well.. nice purse.
- Thank you

938
01:36:19,309 --> 01:36:20,799
You..

939
01:36:23,313 --> 01:36:26,305
you must've felt strange
about the other day

940
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:30,479
Thank you

941
01:36:35,325 --> 01:36:40,490
l had no idea things between
the two of you were so..

942
01:36:40,564 --> 01:36:42,395
We work very hard..

943
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:45,563
on trying to look
like a happy couple

944
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,667
How long has this been going on?

945
01:36:48,338 --> 01:36:50,363
For a very long time now

946
01:36:51,341 --> 01:36:55,334
Ever since Steve's export business
had to be shut down..

947
01:36:55,412 --> 01:36:58,575
and he had to work
with his father..

948
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:02,375
things have really turned ugly

949
01:37:04,354 --> 01:37:09,724
l can only keep hoping that
everything will turn out well

950
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:15,491
But how can he raise his hand at
you? How can you let him do that?

951
01:37:23,373 --> 01:37:28,606
l'm sorry. l was feeling very lonely

952
01:37:31,381 --> 01:37:33,406
''lt's okay, lra''

953
01:37:37,387 --> 01:37:39,685
l've come from the doctor's

954
01:37:46,396 --> 01:37:47,658
What happened?

955
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:54,427
l was pregnant

956
01:37:55,405 --> 01:38:02,072
l lost my baby that day

957
01:38:05,415 --> 01:38:07,440
l lost my child

958
01:38:34,444 --> 01:38:35,502
Hi.
- Hi

959
01:38:36,446 --> 01:38:39,438
l hope l haven't come
at the wrong time?

960
01:38:39,516 --> 01:38:41,416
''No, it's okay..''

961
01:38:41,485 --> 01:38:44,454
''Well, since it's already
a week, l thought..''

962
01:38:45,455 --> 01:38:47,980
Come in.. come

963
01:39:01,071 --> 01:39:06,475
l thought l'd ask you to treat
me to a nice Sunday brunch

964
01:39:07,477 --> 01:39:08,808
But..

965
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:17,613
''Rahul, you've come to
check whether l'm okay''

966
01:39:18,488 --> 01:39:21,514
''Oh no, l'm really hungry..''

967
01:39:21,591 --> 01:39:24,492
and l don't want to eat alone

968
01:39:26,496 --> 01:39:30,523
You know l'm a great cook.
You must've heard

969
01:39:31,468 --> 01:39:32,901
Yeah

970
01:39:33,236 --> 01:39:36,433
''ln that case, l'll quickly
rustle up a meal..''

971
01:39:36,506 --> 01:39:39,498
while you.. go and take a bath?

972
01:39:41,511 --> 01:39:43,536
You don't have to
feel so responsible

973
01:39:46,249 --> 01:39:48,513
because l had a good
cry at your place

974
01:39:49,519 --> 01:39:53,455
l'm not feeling responsible.
lt's just that l want to..

975
01:39:53,523 --> 01:39:56,981
hear a bit of praise for
my culinary skills

976
01:40:11,274 --> 01:40:12,468
My cool breath..

977
01:40:12,542 --> 01:40:16,034
seems to be saying
something to you..

978
01:40:16,546 --> 01:40:19,538
if only you will pay heed

979
01:40:19,616 --> 01:40:21,948
if only you will pay heed

980
01:40:23,553 --> 01:40:25,521
My heart-beat..

981
01:40:25,589 --> 01:40:27,819
it's quickening

982
01:40:28,892 --> 01:40:31,554
What can l do..?

983
01:40:31,628 --> 01:40:34,222
What can l do..?

984
01:40:35,565 --> 01:40:39,558
''Tiptoeing into my heart,
stealthily going to my head..''

985
01:40:39,636 --> 01:40:43,128
is this heady feeling

986
01:40:43,573 --> 01:40:45,871
is this heady feeling

987
01:40:47,577 --> 01:40:49,602
''Slowly, gradually..''

988
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:54,582
this aching awakens a fragrance

989
01:40:55,585 --> 01:40:57,610
this aching awakens a fragrance

990
01:40:59,322 --> 01:41:00,619
What on earth is..

991
01:41:02,325 --> 01:41:05,590
coming over us?

992
01:41:07,597 --> 01:41:10,760
coming over us?

993
01:41:11,601 --> 01:41:16,004
What on earth is..

994
01:41:16,072 --> 01:41:18,597
coming over us?

995
01:41:19,609 --> 01:41:22,077
Whoever knows

996
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:40,653
These silent moments
seem to be humming..

997
01:41:41,364 --> 01:41:45,061
Time has come to a standstill

998
01:41:48,371 --> 01:41:53,809
''With a smile, Time bids us..''

999
01:41:55,645 --> 01:41:59,638
to forget about ourselves

1000
01:41:59,716 --> 01:42:03,652
Why's there a smokescreen.
a haze descends..

1001
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,951
all around us

1002
01:42:08,024 --> 01:42:09,685
all around us

1003
01:42:11,394 --> 01:42:14,659
What on earth..

1004
01:42:15,732 --> 01:42:18,792
is coming over us?

1005
01:42:19,869 --> 01:42:22,804
is coming over us?

1006
01:42:22,872 --> 01:42:27,673
What on earth..

1007
01:42:27,744 --> 01:42:31,305
is coming over us?

1008
01:42:31,681 --> 01:42:33,706
Whoever cares

1009
01:42:59,709 --> 01:43:05,113
''For a moment or two, we enjoy
this illuminating light..''

1010
01:43:05,448 --> 01:43:10,078
only to return to the
despairing darkness

1011
01:43:11,721 --> 01:43:16,749
''ln these moments, our lives..''

1012
01:43:19,729 --> 01:43:23,825
let's live to the fullest

1013
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:28,303
Apprehension clouds my mind.
Will l see you again..?

1014
01:43:28,371 --> 01:43:31,204
who knows

1015
01:43:31,741 --> 01:43:33,868
who knows

1016
01:43:35,745 --> 01:43:39,738
''This moment of restraint,
in my heart..''

1017
01:43:39,816 --> 01:43:41,784
awakens an aching

1018
01:43:42,852 --> 01:43:46,310
awakens an aching

1019
01:43:46,756 --> 01:43:54,288
Whatever's happening to us?

1020
01:43:54,764 --> 01:43:59,360
Who cares

1021
01:44:11,781 --> 01:44:13,840
His flight arrives at 8:30

1022
01:44:16,519 --> 01:44:18,453
So you're going to receive him?

1023
01:44:19,789 --> 01:44:24,283
l ought to go. Maybe

1024
01:44:25,795 --> 01:44:26,955
And later?

1025
01:44:33,803 --> 01:44:38,900
Life will continue. Like before

1026
01:44:43,813 --> 01:44:45,838
l'm going to Delhi for
a few days tomorrow

1027
01:45:05,835 --> 01:45:12,297
l can't stand the idea of
you going back to him

1028
01:45:12,842 --> 01:45:15,174
''So what am l to do, Rahul?''

1029
01:45:31,861 --> 01:45:34,159
Come with me to Delhi

1030
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:38,862
Just leave him

1031
01:45:41,871 --> 01:45:45,807
''You've come into my life
a bit too late, Rahul''

1032
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:48,867
l don't have the courage anymore

1033
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,849
Everything has become
far too complicated

1034
01:45:57,887 --> 01:46:00,082
We could at least give it a try?

1035
01:46:01,891 --> 01:46:04,257
But we'll never find peace

1036
01:46:07,630 --> 01:46:11,896
l'll always cherish the moments
we have spent together

1037
01:46:14,904 --> 01:46:20,103
''l'm afraid, l don't want
things to go wrong again''

1038
01:46:23,646 --> 01:46:29,243
Perhaps it would be best that
we don't meet ever again

1039
01:46:42,332 --> 01:46:44,095
Steve had got to know

1040
01:46:45,668 --> 01:46:47,932
And then that night at Anticlock..

1041
01:46:51,941 --> 01:46:55,502
He blurted out everything to
me in a drunken state one day

1042
01:46:58,948 --> 01:47:00,108
lsn't it strange?

1043
01:47:01,184 --> 01:47:03,880
Here's this girl who's the
root cause of everything..

1044
01:47:03,953 --> 01:47:07,320
isn't it strange that she's the one
you're about to get married to

1045
01:47:12,962 --> 01:47:14,987
Any news of Nikhil?

1046
01:47:15,064 --> 01:47:17,498
That's exactly why l
have called you here

1047
01:47:18,968 --> 01:47:20,993
Nikhil has been released from jail

1048
01:47:21,704 --> 01:47:25,936
No wonder you look so hassled. He
really had a thing for Anamika..?

1049
01:47:31,981 --> 01:47:34,074
Take a look at these

1050
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:50,096
''So, that's why you
got me out of jail''

1051
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,968
l wanted to tell you all
this earlier Nikhil..

1052
01:47:53,036 --> 01:47:56,005
So why tell me now? You want
me to kill Steve for you?

1053
01:47:56,072 --> 01:48:00,133
Or do you want me to bump off
Rahul for having jilted you?

1054
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:03,035
So that you can live
in peace ever after?

1055
01:48:03,112 --> 01:48:05,512
''Please, Nikhil.. don't
misunderstand me''

1056
01:48:05,581 --> 01:48:08,015
What do you want me to make of this
lra? What do you want to explain?

1057
01:48:15,024 --> 01:48:21,156
''You know, there was so much happiness
in my life only 3 years ago''

1058
01:48:24,033 --> 01:48:27,196
Everything appeared
so very clear to me

1059
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:32,706
l used to believe that l could
achieve anything l wanted to

1060
01:48:36,045 --> 01:48:37,205
But now..

1061
01:48:42,051 --> 01:48:45,487
l find myself a mere pawn
in your filthy games

1062
01:48:58,668 --> 01:49:00,568
''Sir, Nikhil is here''

1063
01:49:08,077 --> 01:49:13,014
''Go away, Nikhil. Don't compel
me to summon the police''

1064
01:49:14,684 --> 01:49:18,211
''Actually, l was here to
talk to you about lra''

1065
01:49:22,091 --> 01:49:26,084
''Strange, isn't it, that you
used to call me Casanova..?''

1066
01:49:30,099 --> 01:49:31,293
Does Anamika know?

1067
01:49:46,115 --> 01:49:51,246
Shoot.. go ahead! l don't have
anything to live for anyway

1068
01:49:53,122 --> 01:49:57,252
What could be better than dying
at the hands of my friend?

1069
01:50:22,151 --> 01:50:27,145
''lf l press your finger now, will
it mean you have shot yourself?''

1070
01:50:28,758 --> 01:50:33,752
The pistol was in my hand but it
was Steve who pulled the trigger

1071
01:50:35,164 --> 01:50:37,724
Steve squeezed my finger
and you know why!

1072
01:50:45,174 --> 01:50:52,103
l had implicit faith in you. l
thought you'd get me out of jail

1073
01:50:55,184 --> 01:51:00,178
But you did your best
to keep me right there

1074
01:51:05,194 --> 01:51:06,456
You want to see what happened to me?

1075
01:51:07,196 --> 01:51:08,458
Take a look! Look!

1076
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:11,791
Look at this!

1077
01:51:14,203 --> 01:51:18,367
''This is what you thought l
deserved, isn't it? This..?''

1078
01:51:48,237 --> 01:51:49,829
Chandu-bhai.. please! Please!

1079
01:52:12,261 --> 01:52:13,660
l was raped

1080
01:52:16,265 --> 01:52:17,789
''l was raped, Rahul''

1081
01:52:47,296 --> 01:52:51,790
''Hi Rahul.. what is it, Rahul?''

1082
01:52:52,301 --> 01:53:01,334
''Anu, can you come here? Now?''

1083
01:53:04,313 --> 01:53:07,441
''lt's important, please''

1084
01:53:07,516 --> 01:53:09,484
''Yes, sure..''

1085
01:53:20,329 --> 01:53:23,594
Sit down. Will you have some tea?

1086
01:53:23,666 --> 01:53:24,928
What's up?

1087
01:53:25,334 --> 01:53:28,326
l'll make some tea for you. Sit down

1088
01:53:30,339 --> 01:53:33,331
No Rahul.. what is the matter?

1089
01:53:33,409 --> 01:53:36,276
Why have you called
me here like this?

1090
01:53:39,348 --> 01:53:41,816
l'm trying to muster some courage

1091
01:53:44,353 --> 01:53:47,948
l don't know how l'm
going to tell you

1092
01:53:55,364 --> 01:53:56,626
Just tell me

1093
01:54:00,369 --> 01:54:02,303
Before l met you..

1094
01:54:04,373 --> 01:54:06,307
lra and l..

1095
01:54:09,378 --> 01:54:14,315
lra and l had an affair

1096
01:54:27,396 --> 01:54:28,988
l'm sorry..

1097
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:35,996
l didn't tell you earlier.
l thought..

1098
01:54:36,405 --> 01:54:38,339
We've been together for 3 years

1099
01:54:40,409 --> 01:54:43,572
Didn't you consider it necessary
to tell me about it?

1100
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:54,754
Do the two of you.. even now..?

1101
01:54:55,424 --> 01:54:57,016
No

1102
01:55:23,452 --> 01:55:27,115
Why're you telling
me all this today?

1103
01:55:28,457 --> 01:55:30,391
l met Nikhil today

1104
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:42,765
He wasn't the one who fired the shot

1105
01:55:45,474 --> 01:55:47,499
Wasn't him..?

1106
01:55:49,478 --> 01:55:51,412
The pistol was in his hand

1107
01:55:52,481 --> 01:55:59,148
But it was Steve who pressed
his finger on the trigger

1108
01:56:00,489 --> 01:56:05,825
That's why lra arranged
for Nikhil's bail

1109
01:56:16,505 --> 01:56:17,563
l'm going home

1110
01:56:23,512 --> 01:56:26,447
l can't figure out anything

1111
01:56:30,519 --> 01:56:33,010
l need to be alone

1112
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:04,542
l'm leaving Mumbai tomorrow..

1113
01:57:06,555 --> 01:57:10,082
and wanted to meet you before l left

1114
01:57:12,561 --> 01:57:16,554
Rahul has told me everything

1115
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:21,627
Come in

1116
01:57:33,582 --> 01:57:36,779
l wanted to talk to you about Nikhil

1117
01:57:42,258 --> 01:57:43,725
l know..

1118
01:57:45,594 --> 01:57:48,028
Nikhil has been bothering you a lot

1119
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:54,592
The things that have happened
in my life..

1120
01:57:54,670 --> 01:57:56,934
l can't figure out anything

1121
01:57:58,607 --> 01:58:02,873
''Nikhil had to spend 3 years
in prison, for no reason''

1122
01:58:04,613 --> 01:58:07,548
l can't imagine what he
must've gone through

1123
01:58:09,618 --> 01:58:14,555
He survived jail only because of you

1124
01:58:20,629 --> 01:58:24,065
''Anamika, he's very lonely..''

1125
01:58:25,634 --> 01:58:27,625
also very troubled

1126
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:35,575
lf you could meet him just once..

1127
01:59:16,685 --> 01:59:17,743
Anamika..?

1128
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:23,123
Hi

1129
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:47,649
You've gone through so much
of hardship because of me

1130
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:52,311
You must really be hating me?

1131
01:59:54,723 --> 01:59:56,816
Why're you making fun of me?

1132
02:00:00,729 --> 02:00:05,757
''l too had liked you, Nikhil..''

1133
02:00:07,736 --> 02:00:09,670
when we first met

1134
02:00:12,741 --> 02:00:17,678
Life has played a very
cruel joke on you

1135
02:00:37,766 --> 02:00:41,725
''So.. what do you want
from me, Nikhil?''

1136
02:00:48,377 --> 02:00:50,777
l used to often have
this dream in jail

1137
02:00:50,846 --> 02:00:53,781
That l wake up in the morning..

1138
02:00:53,849 --> 02:00:57,717
to find you lying beside me

1139
02:01:00,389 --> 02:01:03,790
There's a slight smile on your face.

1140
02:01:04,793 --> 02:01:07,455
l used to get a lot of
comfort from this dream

1141
02:01:13,802 --> 02:01:17,101
Will you make this dream
of mine come true?

1142
02:01:38,827 --> 02:01:39,885
How are you?

1143
02:01:42,831 --> 02:01:46,392
''l'm fine, and you''

1144
02:01:52,841 --> 02:01:54,775
We're meeting after ages

1145
02:01:56,845 --> 02:01:59,939
You didn't even come to
see me at the hospital

1146
02:02:00,849 --> 02:02:03,044
l went there several times..

1147
02:02:03,852 --> 02:02:09,381
but l never could muster
the courage to meet you

1148
02:02:14,796 --> 02:02:15,922
Are you mad at me?

1149
02:02:20,869 --> 02:02:25,863
You ought to have told
me everything first

1150
02:02:29,878 --> 02:02:35,111
l never had the guts for anything

1151
02:02:38,887 --> 02:02:44,086
l even told you that you had
come into my life too late

1152
02:02:49,898 --> 02:02:52,890
Maybe l've finally got
to be a bit brave

1153
02:02:55,904 --> 02:03:02,309
''l'm leaving Mumbai, leaving Steve..''

1154
02:03:02,911 --> 02:03:05,846
Where are you going?
- Dehradun

1155
02:03:07,916 --> 02:03:12,114
''Tell me, how could
l have gone away..''

1156
02:03:12,921 --> 02:03:15,355
without telling Nikhil the truth?

1157
02:03:24,933 --> 02:03:30,337
Don't hate me for being a weakling

1158
02:03:33,942 --> 02:03:39,244
lt'll be difficult to live
with such a lot of hatred

1159
02:04:03,972 --> 02:04:05,906
Oh my God

1160
02:04:08,977 --> 02:04:12,936
l have waited for this moment
for so many years.

1161
02:04:20,589 --> 02:04:22,921
lf only time would stop now..

1162
02:04:23,992 --> 02:04:26,654
Why do you love me so much?

1163
02:04:30,999 --> 02:04:32,660
l won't be able to explain

1164
02:04:57,025 --> 02:04:58,287
Why have you come here?

1165
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:03,497
To take revenge on Rahul?

1166
02:05:07,035 --> 02:05:08,627
Or is it out of pity for me?

1167
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:26,146
''l wanted to spend my entire
life with you,..''

1168
02:05:28,056 --> 02:05:31,992
so that l could give
you more love..

1169
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:33,994
than there is in this world

1170
02:05:41,069 --> 02:05:43,060
''You love Rahul very much, don't you?''

1171
02:06:00,088 --> 02:06:04,752
l'm all yours and always will be

1172
02:06:08,096 --> 02:06:11,088
But you were not mine..

1173
02:06:11,166 --> 02:06:14,192
and never will be

1174
02:06:17,105 --> 02:06:18,766
''Go away, Anamika''

1175
02:06:23,111 --> 02:06:30,608
l.. l'm sorry Nikhil. l'm sorry

1176
02:06:51,134 --> 02:06:55,070
''My dreams, shattered''

1177
02:06:55,138 --> 02:06:59,472
''My loved one, separated from me''

1178
02:06:59,542 --> 02:07:03,808
What season is this..?

1179
02:07:04,147 --> 02:07:07,810
that snatches all joy from me?

1180
02:07:11,154 --> 02:07:15,090
''My dreams, shattered''

1181
02:07:15,158 --> 02:07:19,185
''My loved one, separated from me''

1182
02:07:19,262 --> 02:07:23,824
What season is this..?

1183
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:28,200
that snatches all joy from me?

1184
02:07:29,172 --> 02:07:36,101
l was never in my
senses all my life

1185
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:43,551
l was never in my
senses all my life

1186
02:07:54,197 --> 02:07:58,190
Little did l know..

1187
02:08:02,205 --> 02:08:08,144
l would shed tears like this

1188
02:08:10,813 --> 02:08:14,146
How was l to know..

1189
02:08:14,217 --> 02:08:18,210
that my Eden was about
to be plundered

1190
02:08:18,288 --> 02:08:22,156
All that l would have..

1191
02:08:22,225 --> 02:08:25,160
is this solitary moment

1192
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:32,896
Never was l in my
senses all my life

1193
02:08:34,237 --> 02:08:41,234
never wasl in my
senses all my life

1194
02:09:03,266 --> 02:09:10,536
What you have left behind is
a tale of despairing hearts..

1195
02:09:12,275 --> 02:09:17,212
and where have you gone to?

1196
02:09:20,283 --> 02:09:23,309
ln an alien dwelling..

1197
02:09:23,386 --> 02:09:27,550
there's only loneliness ahead

1198
02:09:28,291 --> 02:09:34,230
This one moment.. the
wind blows the other way

1199
02:09:35,298 --> 02:09:42,534
Barely have l been in my
senses during my life

1200
02:09:42,972 --> 02:09:50,276
Barely have l been in my
senses during my life

1201
02:09:52,315 --> 02:09:55,910
''My dreams, shattered''

1202
02:09:56,319 --> 02:09:59,880
''My loved one, separated from me''

1203
02:10:00,323 --> 02:10:04,760
What season is this..?

1204
02:10:05,328 --> 02:10:08,923
that snatches all joy from me?

1205
02:10:09,332 --> 02:10:16,397
Barely have l been in my
senses during my life

1206
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:25,270
Barely have l been in my

What do you want? What did you
gain by shooting at Rahul?

You've already ruined my life.

1253
02:16:14,697 --> 02:16:18,633
Nikhil.. Nikhil..

1254

1266
02:18:10,813 --> 02:18:12,804
''l'm sorry, Rahul''

1267
02:18:15,818 --> 02:18:17,308
Because of me..

1268
02:18:19,822 --> 02:18:22,882
''Nikhil, nothing's going
to happen to you''

1269
02:18:23,826 --> 02:18:29,162
No.. l don't think l will make it

1270
02:18:29,231 --> 02:18:32,496
''Nikhil, please don't say that..''

1271
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:40,934
''Anamika, promise me something''

1272
02:18:43,846 --> 02:18:49,113
Don't you worry.. l won't
ask you to marry me

1273
02:18:51,787 --> 02:18:52,913
Promise me..

1274

''Remember, l'm the helpful types?''

Couldn't you have waited
a little longer?
