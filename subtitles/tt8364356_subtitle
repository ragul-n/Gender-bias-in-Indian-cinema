1
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,166
Till date you have lost ten ties…

2
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,625
Do you chew them up?

3
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,500
Yes… I like chewing ties…

4
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,666
You'll not get any more ties…
There's none left at school…

5
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,250
Not a single one?

6
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,916
No… I've told your mother…

7
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,125
She'll not buy you one either…

8
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,375
Chill ma'am…

9
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,791
I'll give this tie to Mom…

10
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:11,166
She'll Xerox them and send them to you…

11
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,166
Why didn't you complete
the colouring at home?

12
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,208
You don't know what a mess it is at home!

13
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,958
There is no peace at home.

14
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,666
Dad beats up Mom…

15
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,083
That's why she didn't make me
do any of this last night…

16
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,166
Went to bed without having dinner…

17
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,958
They said the forbidden 'word'…

18
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,500
Which word?

19
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,875
Witch… witch…

20
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,041
Witch?

21
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,333
Stitch…

22
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,791
Stitch…?

23
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,875
Ditch… ditch…

24
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:37,916
Really?

25
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,333
Oh… don't you get it?

26
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,208
No…

27
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,375
Pitch… pitch…

28
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,875
Pitch…?

29
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,000
Glitch...!
What is it?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,791
May I say it once?
No… I'm forbidding you.

31
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,333
Just once… No… no…

32
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,541
My tummy is rumbling!
You'll not say it!

33
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,916
My tummy… tummy is rumbling…
Don't say it...!

34
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,833
Please let me say 'bitch' once!

35
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,416
The word you forbade me to say...
just popped out!

36
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,333
Dear Nephew!

37
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,333
What happened?

38
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,416
Finished…

39
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,291
That was it?
Hmmm…

40
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,208
You finished playing the game of dice?

41
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,833
What are you thinking now?

42
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,750
What are you thinking?

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,625
Something running in your mind?

44
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,666
After thinking a lot...

45
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,166
I've decided to marry you.

46
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,541
A gentle kiss...

47
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,208
What's this Bhutu?

48
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,333
You couldn't wait to open your gifts?

49
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,375
But everyone has given only chocolates
and colouring pens…

50
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,458
Nothing else…

51
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,416
Why?

52
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,916
Here…

53
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:27,333
Papa has got you a new phone…

54
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Have a look…

55
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,333
First give your papa a kissy!

56
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,625
Should I?

57
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,666
Should I also give you a kissy?

58
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,833
No no… why kissy?

59
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,333
Kissy means you want something in return…
One kissy…

60
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,916
No way... I'm scared of your kisses …

61
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,916
Check this out…

62
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,500
Soma has sent photos on
the Whatsapp group…

63
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,583
Listen… see this…

64
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,416
They are going to Switzerland…

65
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,458
Oh God…

66
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,916
They're going to the Alps!
Look here…

67
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,875
Let us go to Switzerland…
See…I knew it…

68
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,750
A kissy means you're up to something!

69
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,000
Switzerland…
Didn't I take you to Andaman?

70
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,541
Papa!
What happened?

71
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,958
Can't make calls on this…

72
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,416
Who said so?

73
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,916
See… you have calculator
and Temple Run…

74
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,666
Where is Switzerland!

75
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,875
Where is Andaman! Nonsense!

76
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,250
Check out the games…

77
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,250
Go now, play!

78
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,125
Mr. Laltu!

79
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,000
This Soma! Soma will
be the end of me…

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,583
Then this whatsapp and facebook groups…

81
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:53,541
They keep sharing photos of trips…
jewellery… clothes…

82
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,458
And I'm losing my night's sleep…

83
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,375
Earlier, it was only outside the school…
now, it has entered my bedroom!

84
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,125
Danger group!
This is an echo group…

85
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,833
Mitali's son is naughty
naughty… naughty… naughty…

86
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,875
They are typing it and sharing it…

87
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,166
Soma has diarrhoea…
Type and share…

88
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,250
Find out first…

89
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,625
Switzerland… Switzerland… Switzerland…

90
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,750
No… no… no… no…

91
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,291
Kissy... kissy... kissy...

92
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,666
First stop celebrating your
son's birthday party with a live DJ…

93
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,250
My furniture shop will
soon run into losses…

94
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,958
Listen… the total headcount
at the birthday party was 100…

95
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,041
with 12% GST…
total comes to 58,100 rupees…

96
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,958
Thankfully, it was a child's
birthday…no liquor…

97
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,458
Then, add the payments for decoration…

98
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:55,500
Tomorrow, Bhutu's school friends
must be given chocolates…

99
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,333
Please let's…

100
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,333
Come on…

101
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,125
come here…

102
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,708
Walk in a line…
Look at these sets…

103
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,500
Tomorrow, you said,
The day went to bed...

104
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,833
The day after, did you say
Years passed in play...

105
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:23,333
Today did you say,
You ruled the world your way.

106
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,500
Yes… come here…

107
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,666
Okay kids… Study hard…

108
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,291
Okay kids… Study hard…

109
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,583
Come here, let me brush your hair…

110
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,833
Be a good girl...
Bye… bye…

111
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,375
Kindly come this side please…

112
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,750
Good morning…

113
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,208
Good morning…

114
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,791
Ma'am, Tanuruchi and her parents
are here…
should I call them in?

115
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,500
Let's get the basic interview done…
then she can join her class…

116
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,458
Please come in…
Come on… let's go…

117
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,958
Come on…children…

118
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:24,125
Chachajaan...
Bodhiswatto… how are you?

119
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,041
It was my birthday yesterday...
So?

120
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,125
Spread your palm…

121
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:36,958
You gave me sweets on your birthday…

122
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,125
I should also give you something
in return, right?

123
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,083
Wait wait… where did I put it…

124
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:50,625
Yes… here you go…
A very happy birthday to you…

125
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,916
Say thank you Thank you…

126
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,166
Come on…let's share this chocolate…

127
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,041
Happy Birthday dude…

128
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,291
Go ahead…

129
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,833
My father's name is Srinjoy Sen…
my mother's name is Rina Sen…

130
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,291
And my name is Tanuruchi Sen…

131
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,333
Very good…

132
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,416
So you have completely shifted over here?

133
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,833
Actually, after Rina's father's demise…
my mother-in-law had become very lonely…

134
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,708
It was difficult to keep traveling
between the two cities…

135
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,125
So, I thought we should
just move back completely from Delhi…

136
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Anyway, the academic schedule
of the university is very hectic…

137
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,208
The institute here will leave
me more time with research…

138
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,458
I'll also get to spend more
time with Tanuruchi…

139
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,916
There's just one thing…
regarding
the mandate that the board has given…

140
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:08,291
That all teaching and non-teaching staff…
have to go through a psychometric test…

141
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,750
Have you started that?

142
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,125
Yes… we do know about this order
from the board.

143
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,458
But it's just a matter of time…

144
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,416
It's just that…
she's a 'girl' child…

145
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:29,125
First Gurgaon… then Kolkata…
we're really scared…
all shaken up…

146
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,791
God knows
who has what on their mind…

147
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:41,583
Here we have a lot of old staff…
working for the past 30 years…15 years…

148
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,750
We have a lot of faith in them…

149
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,375
Also there aren't any adverse reports…

150
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:55,416
Imagine, someone working for 30 years,
going through a psychometric test…

151
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,916
reveals that he has a mental disease…

152
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:04,500
What do you do then?
Throw him out? Or keep him?

153
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:10,583
I can understand what you are saying…
I, too, am in the teaching profession…

154
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:15,625
That's why I feel that psychometric
tests should be compulsory…

155
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,708
If after 30 years…it is discovered...

156
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,375
That someone has a tendency...

157
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:26,166
which is harmful for a child…

158
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,583
At least, one child can be saved.
That's right…

159
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,791
Well, your school is really very clean…

160
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,416
Actually, in our university campus
peacocks flocked the grounds…

161
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,875
Tanuruchi's class will start…
Yes.

162
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,583
Should I take her there?
Sure…

163
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,166
Be a good girl, ok?
Hmmm…

164
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,291
Is this your only name?
My pet name is 'Chini'…

165
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,000
'Chini'… wow, that's
such a sweet name…

166
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,791
It was Bodhiswatto's birthday yesterday…
he has brought chocolates for everybody…

167
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,916
Happy Birthday Bodhiswatto…

168
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
Please sit…

169
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:26,291
Today, a new friend is joining your class…

170
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,541
She has a very sweet name…

171
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,833
Her name is Tanuruchi Sen….

172
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,916
Who wants to sit beside her?

173
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,541
Me… me… me…

174
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,625
Beside whom? Let's see…

175
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,875
Wow! Tanuruchi has made
so many friends on the first day…

176
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,250
It was Bodhiswatto's birthday yesterday…
So let her sit beside him?

177
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,583
Happy Birthday, Bodhiswatto…
Thank you ma'am…

178
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,958
Take her along… go ahead…

179
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,666
Carry on with your class…

180
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,791
Sit down, Tanuruchi…

181
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,916
So class… we have
5 pencils…
how many?

182
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,166
5...

183
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,541
From there, if you give away...

184
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,500
3 pencils to your friend…
How many will you have?

185
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,041
2...

186
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,916
Good...

187
00:16:55,916 --> 00:17:01,166
If your father gets you 10 chocolates…
and you give 5 of them to your friend…

188
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,166
Then, how many do you have?

189
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,708
5...

190
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:10,583
Write this down…
so, 10 minus 5 is…
5…

191
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,791
I don't need them… I told you…

192
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:41,000
Don't think, this is a toy
phone ok? It has a calculator…

193
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,125
games… clock…

194
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:49,208
Only Papa has said…
it is not allowed
to talk over the phone in school…

195
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,875
So I have left the connection at home…

196
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:57,416
I'll put it back when I go back
home…special phone!

197
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,875
Loads of cameras in school…

198
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,541
You'll give me right?
I will… first give me your tiffin…

199
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,041
Me too… me too…

200
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
Shhh…

201
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,750
Shotru(enemy) is coming…
don't say anything…

202
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:23,166
Hello… what are you hiding?
Let me see… come on…

203
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,875
What? What do you want?

204
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,333
Jhumur is here…

205
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:34,291
Dude… the new girl is
sitting alone and crying…

206
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,083
Come on… let's see…

207
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:52,375
She is crying…
She is still crying…

208
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,541
What happened?
I don't think
she understands Bengali…

209
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,333
She doesn't…

210
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,083
What?

211
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:07,250
First, when I came to school,
I cried a lot for home…

212
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,083
Used to be homesick…

213
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,625
I used to cry at the school gate everyday…

214
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,875
Mom would force me in…

215
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:22,416
Hello… hello all…

216
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,000
Sita… What?

217
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
In Ramayana,
when Ravan had kidnapped Sita…

218
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,625
Then Hanuman had
entertained Sita with his games…

219
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,291
Let us all become Hanuman…
Yes… yes…

220
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,041
We are monkeys now, ok?

221
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,583
Were you feeling unwell at
the assembly today?

222
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,666
Hmm… What happened?

223
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,875
I was feeling tipsy…

224
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,541
Tipsy?

225
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,083
How does that feel?

226
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,041
What's that in your hand?

227
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,708
Scotch…

228
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,083
Oh… scotch…

229
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,833
You get tipsy after drinking scotch…

230
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,375
So, who drinks scotch?

231
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,250
Daddy?
Hmmm…

232
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,708
Mummy?
Hmmm…

233
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,541
Last night…

234
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,875
Did you drink scotch last night?

235
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,375
I was inhaling scotch…

236
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,125
Manik uncle makes me
sniff it in the kitchen…

237
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,708
You get tipsy even then…

238
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,750
Ok fine… tell me something…

239
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,666
Does your father let you drive?

240
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,625
No…

241
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,666
Why?

242
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,458
He says that you can't
drive without a license…

243
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
You can get a license
only when you are older…

244
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,916
Correct…

245
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:21,708
You must be older than the boys
in high school…
You must be 18 years old…

246
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,250
Then only you can get the license…

247
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,166
Otherwise, the police will catch
you, if you drive…

248
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,875
Similarly, …

249
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,250
Even drinking scotch requires a license…

250
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,291
You have to grow up for that…

251
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,333
Otherwise, the police will catch you…

252
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,166
For sniffing also?
Yes…

253
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:50,041
I won't do it anymore…
I will never get tipsy again…

254
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,125
Will you remember?

255
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,666
Thank you…

256
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,250
Good boy… go ahead…

257
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,833
Come here… Sit at the back…

258
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,291
Okay… tata… go to that bus…

259
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:27,541
Office asked me to introduce her to you…
She'll be traveling in your school bus…

260
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,791
I have added some pickles with
the trinkets…
Such a hit!

261
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:36,208
We went to Siuri during the holidays…
We got all this from there…

262
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:41,000
Look here… mango, apple
and so many other fruits…

263
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:44,250
Have you heard of so many types of pickles?

264
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:50,458
Dot at 7.30 am ma'am…
You can rely on me completely…

265
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,541
The shop near the bus stand…
Nandadulal's shop…
I tied up with him…

266
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,958
Even Uttam Kumar
purchased pickles from there!

267
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,458
What attitude!

268
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,791
Blow the horn…

269
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:15,625
Just look at her… Too much!

270
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,375
Let me call you back…

271
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,500
The Councillor's wife, after all!

272
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,125
Take a small bite.

273
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,416
Is this even a whatsapp group?

274
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,666
The mothers are gossiping continuously…

275
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,458
Bitching about each other…
The whole day…

276
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,416
There aren't working mothers there…

277
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,833
Why don't you exit the group?

278
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,875
No no… they'll think I'm snobbish…

279
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,375
Other than that...

280
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,666
You get regular updates…

281
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,333
What's happening in school…

282
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,000
That's true… cheers…

283
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,333
We can stay updated.

284
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,583
I also had to post
our family picture in the group.

285
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
But what I was thinking is…

286
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,875
Was it a right decision to
bring Chini to Kolkata?

287
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,333
Even seats in Presidency is
being left vacant…

288
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,416
Ultimately, our children will leave…

289
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,750
Yeah… but where will they go? USA?

290
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,375
There they've stopped
issuing green card…

291
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,750
Oh… Arnab had called…

292
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,500
He had taken his daughter to
USA 10 years back…

293
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,166
Wasn't she Chini's age at that time?

294
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:24,791
Piu is 16 now…
Arnab was saying… he'll send her back.

295
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,541
They'll let her stay till she is 21…

296
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,208
Then for a green card
she has to wait till she is 70…

297
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,041
There you go...

298
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,833
She can't even stay on Arnab's visa…

299
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,791
So…now return to this country...

300
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,958
Apply Odomos
and adjust with dengue…

301
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,625
Dinner time…

302
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:51,125
Darling, did you tell Papa and Mom
about how many friends you made?

303
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
How many?
1…2…3…4…5…

304
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,791
5 friends…
5 friends! Good!

305
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:04,791
Chini's school bus has been sorted…
They'll call me after starting off…

306
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,958
Great!

307
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,083
Is the school good?

308
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,416
What have you brought for tiffin?

309
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,708
'Luchi' and veggies…

310
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,125
This is 'puri'…

311
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,666
What 'puri'? This is I'uchi'…

312
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:55,916
No dumbo… you don't know…
This is 'puri'…

313
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,500
This is 'luchi'…

314
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,333
No no… this is 'puri'…

315
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,583
Hey… tell me what is this?

316
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,375
'Luchi'…

317
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,416
Happy?

318
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,583
Ok…ok…

319
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:16,166
Tanuruchi's 'puri'… and my 'luchi'…
so from today, we'll call it 'luchipuri'…

320
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:19,000
So… 'Luchipuri' and 'kalojaam'…

321
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,416
Take it...

322
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,291
No… no… don't give me
the whole thing…

323
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,250
Listen… sweet is good…
You are sweet… so is the 'kalojaam'…

324
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,916
And this is called spaghetti…

325
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,041
This is fat noodles…

326
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,208
No… this is spaghetti…

327
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:51,041
This is fat noodles… fat noodles…

328
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,875
This is spaghetti…

329
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,166
Four pieces of bread
Let's make pairs please

330
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:12,083
French fries do make
Happiness at ease

331
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:16,125
Pea pods mean holidays too

332
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:20,166
Pasta penne must know you

333
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:24,208
A little snack... sweet breeze

334
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:29,833
Story unfolds
stone, paper, scissor days begin

335
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:34,166
My lunch box is always there for you

336
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:38,208
I shall share it just with you.

337
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:49,416
Will you be my friend?
Please let's be friends.

338
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:57,166
It's a treasure trove, my lunch box...

339
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,708
Give me four…

340
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,958
No… two, only two…

341
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,750
Two for me… two for Tanuruchi…

342
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:18,125
Hot fish fries...
do you wanna try?

343
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:22,166
Spicy pickles tasty tickles

344
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:26,166
Hidden away my playfulness

345
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:30,041
The dark confectionary
and spaghetti sweetness.

346
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,875
Shadows look for tenderness...

347
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,041
Fist fights...

348
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:40,083
Stone, paper, scissor days begin.

349
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:44,083
My lunch box is always there for you

350
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,708
I shall share it just with you

351
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,500
Will you be my friend?
Please let's be friends.

352
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:59,083
It's a treasure trove my lunch box...

353
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,958
Come on, lets recite the poem...
Bodhiswatto, what are you doing?

354
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,875
The palm tree stands on one leg...

355
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,750
Leaving all others behind...

356
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,208
Looks beyond the sky...

357
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,666
He thinks of going beyond the clouds...

358
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:20,375
Flying far far away...

359
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:23,000
But where will he get his wings?

360
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:30,625
So he uses his leaves...

361
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:34,958
He has brought a mobile
and is playing games...

362
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,375
What are you doing?

363
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:44,250
Stop... stop...

364
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,083
What is this children?
Mobile...

365
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,750
Can you bring mobile phones to school?

366
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,333
No...

367
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,375
Is it right?
No...

368
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,666
Everybody knows that...
still you've brought it...

369
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,125
Get up...

370
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:00,875
Get up, I said...

371
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,708
Quickly...

372
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,791
Don't you know mobiles
are not allowed in school?

373
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,416
We'll have to inform your parents...
Go and stand outside...

374
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,791
What you have done is very, very bad...

375
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:25,625
Go outside... and this phone
will stay with me...

376
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,958
Go out...

377
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,750
Leave..

378
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:48,291
So he uses his leaves...
To achieve his dreams...

379
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:52,958
He thinks those are his wings...

380
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
He doesn't care
about leaving home...

381
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It rains all day...

382
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,791
Trembling leaves...

383
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:12,958
Dude... my God...
I've never been thrown out of class...

384
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Shame, shame!

385
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,583
Teacher threw the dude out of class!

386
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,125
His parents have also been summoned...

387
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,708
Leave me... leave...

388
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,458
Fight... fight...

389
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,833
What is this!
Bodhiswatto, get up!

390
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,250
Chachajan, you leave him...
You fatso!

391
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,541
Suddenly, I saw the two of them
fighting...
one on top of the other...

392
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:03,291
We ran and separated them...
Even then they were fighting...

393
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:09,541
Hey... what happened?

394
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,083
Where is Bodhiswatto?
He didn't come out...

395
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,375
Where is Ajaatshotru?

396
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,750
Both of them were fighting...
Go to the first aid room...

397
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,000
They kept on fighting...

398
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,125
I couldn't understand what was happening!

399
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,750
May I come in?
Come in...

400
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:39,666
Me too...
Have a seat...

401
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:56,708
In class...
He was showing
this to one of his friends...

402
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,750
How do you allow bringing
mobile phones to school?

403
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,625
We didn't know...
we had no idea ma'am...

404
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:10,166
Actually, we didn't understand
that he'd bring it to school...

405
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,916
Is the school fit for such things?

406
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:17,750
We have told you a hundred times...
Any expensive gifts... toys...

407
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:21,166
Extra tiffin... excess stationeries...
don't give them all these...

408
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:25,166
You are not just spoiling him...
but other children too...

409
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:28,541
Won't the other children feel greedy too?

410
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,875
Tomorrow, onwards, they will
also bring such things...

411
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,291
It has been a mistake ma'am...

412
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,500
But you tell me...

413
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:38,375
Is it right to beat my son
the way Ajaatshotru did?

414
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,875
Do you know...
my Bhutu's elbow...

415
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:44,083
Ma'am, she's talking nonsense.

416
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,916
He has been bringing that mobile..
for the past seven days...

417
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,458
My son noticed it...

418
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,291
May be you didn't notice...
That is why he showed you...

419
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:55,208
Actually, my son is a lot like me...
Can't stand anything wrong...

420
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,958
His son is creating groups...
My son couldn't stand it...

421
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,208
You have to understand whose son he is...

422
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,375
Fighting in school is not allowed...

423
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:06,416
As I said... my son is
actually like me...

424
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:09,125
He must have been attacked...
He immediately defended himself...

425
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,166
He couldn't stand it...

426
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,250
Anyway, they are showing off their
new found wealth from furniture business...

427
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,958
Distributing chocolates...
Why? Can't I buy gifts?

428
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,708
I can buy new gifts everyday...
Fill up the whole school with gifts...

429
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,833
But we won't do that...
Because
his father doesn't like showing off...

430
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:28,041
Ma'am, actually,
we got a call from school...

431
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,791
For the mosquito spray and
pest control...
You must be aware...

432
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:36,708
I'm telling this to both of you...

433
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,125
Don't disrupt the school's
peaceful environment...

434
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:50,166
Come on... go inside.

435
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:58,250
Chachajaan...
Whoa! What is this?

436
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:03,833
Today is my birthday...
So I drew a picture for you...
!

437
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,416
This is so lovely...

438
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:09,333
But then you have to
listen to one of my poems...

439
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:17,416
The sun brought us light...
And the birds sang along...

440
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:21,208
You have heard birds sing, right?

441
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:27,541
And the flowers smiled and said
It is Jhumur's birthday today!

442
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,125
Happy birthday! Come on now...

443
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:40,375
Shut up and
get inside the car...

444
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:45,166
I'll buy this... yeah ok...

445
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:48,458
Oye... you dare complain about my son?

446
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,291
Shop keeper's wife...
shop keeper's family!

447
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:55,333
Have you even looked at yourself?

448
00:35:55,375 --> 00:36:00,875
I am so glad that my son gave a handful...
If I were there, I'd have given some more...

449
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:03,000
You get inside the car...

450
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:07,541
Come back here, you backbiter...
If you can, buy your son a mobile phone...

451
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:12,083
I'll smack you across your face...
Try laying a finger on me...

452
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,166
Don't you dare point fingers at me...

453
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,375
Leave! Leave her!
You dare hit me!

454
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,416
What is happening, pal?

455
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,208
You are cutting off the trees,
right when they are young...

456
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,250
Then you're polishing them…

457
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,750
All that you see here...

458
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,958
All these are compressed wood furniture…

459
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
From Sri Lanka.

460
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,500
Earlier we lived in joint families…
no shifting…

461
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:55,958
Father, son, grandfather all
jumping on the same bed…

462
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,791
Eating health food……

463
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:03,916
Remember the furniture from our childhood…
Big four poster beds we used to climb on…

464
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,500
Nowadays families keep shifting…
Today you're in north… tomorrow in south…

465
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:14,208
Day after to Behala and then to Bangalore…
From there you go to Hyderabad…

466
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,625
You may move to USA…
Then come back to Dubai…

467
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:23,250
Family is shifting… light as feather…
Furniture is also light as feather…

468
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,541
It's durable, right?

469
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:37,666
Biswas Furniture… always trustworthy...

470
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,583
My wife… my son…

471
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,291
We have the same furniture at home…

472
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,375
My son dances on top of them…

473
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,833
Come here, son…

474
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,083
Show them a little of
your Salman Khan steps…

475
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,541
That one?
Yes…

476
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,708
My son is pretty heavy…

477
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,833
Mom has beaten up Shyamoli Aunty…
smacked her right and left…

478
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,458
Chicken ate away all the bleaching powder!

479
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,916
I've made a blunder!
No, you tell me…

480
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,625
Chicken ate bleaching powder?

481
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,416
This is incredible!

482
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,583
Smell it...

483
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,875
No… please forgive…

484
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,000
Shut up!
Smell it…

485
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,500
You swine… eat it
the way your chicken ate it…

486
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,375
What do you think of me? What?

487
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,166
You dare play
dirty politics with me?

488
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,500
I am sorry… forgive me…

489
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:07,125
It will never happen again…

490
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:10,625
I referred you to the corporation…

491
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:14,458
I got him the tender…
thinking he is a needy man…

492
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,166
He knows very well…

493
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:20,416
That the market price for bleaching
powder is
no less than 80 to 100 bucks…

494
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:25,041
Instead, he bought flour for
2 bucks a kilogram…

495
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,583
He bought flour for 2 bucks, this swine!

496
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,416
Come inside once…

497
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,083
Yeah coming…

498
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,250
Then he sprayed that
in the neighbourhood…

499
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,208
Spraying flour instead of bleaching powder!

500
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:48,750
Now that flour is being eaten by…
goats, chicken, ants, mosquitoes…

501
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,750
Now, what will happen to me?

502
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:55,250
Mosquitoes will eat away my seat now…

503
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,333
What is this brother?
Are you even human?

504
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,791
Are you going to come inside or not?

505
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,500
Coming… I said…

506
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,833
Sir, you go in… I'll see to him…

507
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,750
Yes, what happened?

508
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,875
What is it? 'Prasad'?

509
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,458
This is my hair…

510
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,875
Hold it and sit tight…

511
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,625
What happened?

512
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:40,750
She got beaten up on the street…
Beaten up?

513
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,583
Who rubbed her the wrong way?

514
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,708
What happened, my dear?

515
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,875
Rubbed her face in!

516
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Councillor's wife!

517
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,750
Bloody back-biter!

518
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,416
We're done for!

519
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:09,750
Tonight, they'll dump the garbage
bin in front of my shop…

520
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:11,458
Nobody will be able to enter…

521
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,500
They'll put up a 'no parking' sign
in front of the building…

522
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,875
Customers will be unable
to park their cars…

523
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,166
We are done for!

524
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:25,041
4 officers will come down and find
several faults with the building…

525
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,791
Then start running to
the corporation for permission…

526
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,291
You won't even let me do
my business in peace?

527
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,583
They'll kidnap you from home!

528
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:39,166
I'm scared of you now…
You might just hit me someday…

529
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:47,041
I am feeling so uneasy…
I think, I have acidity…

530
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,583
Hey, do you have any medicine?

531
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:57,458
Hotels and restaurants
ask you which oil to use …

532
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,000
How water will be taken
out of the Ganges is decided by you…

533
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:06,708
And that football club…
you even decide their election…

534
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,583
Go away… go away… What go away?

535
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,208
You decide where to sell pre-cut fruits…

536
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,000
Eat this! Stuff your face!

537
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:20,750
Your wife was beaten up in front of
everyone…and pulled by her hair!

538
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:24,166
And what are you doing?
Sitting here and eating fruits?

539
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,500
Shame on you! Shame!

540
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,666
She beat me in front of 'Kuchumona'!

541
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,833
Yeah… he told me…

542
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:37,458
I will not stay here…
I will leave this neighbourhood…

543
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,750
Hey… what are you gaping at?

544
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,041
Aren't you the ganglord of
the neighbourhood?

545
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,416
They beat up your sister-in-law
and what did you do?

546
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,708
Get out of this house…

547
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,041
Get out!

548
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,625
That school is the main culprit!
Downtrodden school...

549
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:59,250
You have to find a solution
to this, I'm warning you!

550
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:02,625
Otherwise, I'll leave and
never come back,
do you hear?

551
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:07,458
Nobody is listening to me…
I'll go away!

552
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:10,916
Who is this?

553
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:13,250
Who is this woman?

554
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:17,291
Call her… let me have a look…

555
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,875
What… hair!

556
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,000
Laltu Biswas…

557
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:12,208
So, you are Laltu Biswas?

558
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,833
But why were you getting scared?

559
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:23,000
Your wife on the other hand…
Is doing such daring things…

560
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:26,625
And you are getting scared?
This isn't right, sir!

561
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,416
Why are you getting scared?

562
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:39,000
So, is your wife going to stand
for the elections this time?

563
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:39,791
No…

564
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:42,958
No? I thought she is…

565
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,458
Anyway… the reason I'm here…

566
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,666
Tomorrow exactly at 7pm…

567
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,750
Come down to our
Shahid Sangha Club… ok?

568
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:52,375
Do come… Yes…

569
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,333
Which club?
Shahid sangha!

570
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,958
Such a gentleman!
Gentleman...

571
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:13,958
Go ahead then…
Your family must be worried…

572
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:19,958
Let's go…

573
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,041
Coming…

574
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,250
Open up…

575
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,541
Coming… coming…

576
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,541
My god! Will you break it open?

577
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,458
Nonsense… Open up…

578
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,125
Give it to me…

579
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,250
Why were you thumping the door, so hard?

580
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:54,541
Weird!

581
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:10,291
Surely loose motions...
something must have happened…

582
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,458
God… my tummy
doesn't feel right at all…

583
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,583
Why? What happened?

584
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:29,958
I think acidity…

585
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,791
Tell me what happened…

586
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,291
Three guys rounded me up on bikes today…

587
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,458
What?
Said I have to go to...

588
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:40,666
Shahid Sangha Club tomorrow…

589
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,083
Why?

590
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,041
Whom do I complain to?

591
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:50,291
Is there anyone?

592
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,208
Can I tell anyone that my wife...

593
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,125
beat up the councillor's wife?

594
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,291
Everything was going so well…

595
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,958
So smoothly…

596
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,250
One after the other
the showrooms were coming up…

597
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,708
The sales... going up…

598
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,541
I thought we are, finally,
going to see good days now…

599
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,125
But no…

600
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,291
how will I be so fortunate?

601
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,250
What happened? Pick it up…

602
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,041
You pick up…

603
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,333
Unbelievable!

604
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,208
Can't you see I'm working?

605
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,625
Weird man! Let me see…

606
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,875
Hello…

607
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,541
… yes?

608
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,500
Yes… yes…

609
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:49,791
Yes, surely he'll go tomorrow…

610
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,666
Definitely…

611
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,208
From the councillor's residence...

612
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,583
Surely... he'll definitely go tomorrow.

613
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,291
They have summoned you
at their place tomorrow…

614
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,750
What were you assuring them about?

615
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,041
He was saying,
'we'll beat him into pulp…'

616
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,416
And you were saying 'Definitely!'

617
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:30,458
'We'll break his leg!'
You said, 'For sure…'

618
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,500
'Don't he dare say anything to anyone…'
And you said, 'Yes… yes…'

619
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,583
You are thinking too much!

620
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,791
Move now…

621
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:39,958
Oh my god…
there's water all over…

622
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,375
You'll fall down…
What are you even doing?

623
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:44,416
Get me medicine…

624
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:46,083
You just had some…

625
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,166
What are you even doing?

626
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,791
OCD!

627
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:54,666
Pregnant!

628
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:58,375
Oh my God, Khusi,
I can't believe this!

629
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,750
After 14 long years…

630
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,916
Yes… yes… I know… I know…

631
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:08,416
You tell Ma yourself…
Ma, Khusi has called…

632
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,458
Listen to her…
You tell Ma yourself…

633
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,125
What are you saying?
Srinjoy, I can't believe this…

634
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:20,375
What happened?
You won't believe what I heard…

635
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,625
My hands are shivering…
Khusi is pregnant!

636
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:27,625
What!
I'm still shivering…

637
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,125
After 14 years!
Fantastic!

638
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:33,791
No wine for tonight…
We shall celebrate with champagne…

639
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:36,541
Ok… let's toast it!
Champagne it is…

640
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,000
Listen to what Ma is saying…

641
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:42,166
Rina… what is Khusi saying!
She is pregnant!

642
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,125
Pregnant!
Champagne time!

643
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:47,041
Dad would have been so
happy, if he were alive…

644
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,916
Khusi is pregnant…
can't imagine!

645
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,583
This is the last time…
do remember that…

646
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,333
Don't come to me with
all this dirty politics…

647
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,833
I'll not be doing this again…

648
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,791
Is it clear?
Last time…

649
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,875
Sir, Laltu Biswas here…

650
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,583
Who Laltu Biswas?

651
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:26,875
Laltu Biswas, sir…

652
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:27,833
Who is he?

653
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:30,000
That one… Who?

654
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:33,416
Your wife… Oh… Oh my my!

655
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,833
You are such a great man…I mean

656
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:42,125
your wife is such a great man!

657
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:44,708
Where's my wife by the way?
She has gone out…

658
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,083
You are great!

659
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:50,416
The thing that I failed at…
my father-in-law failed at…

660
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,125
Your wife has succeeded in that…

661
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:54,458
I feel there is some mistake here…

662
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,833
No mistake…

663
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,875
Please sit… sit down…

664
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,958
Get him a glass of water…
Get rid of them…

665
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,500
Hey… come on… make a move…

666
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:07,958
Great!
Listen brother…

667
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:13,833
My wife is a rich father's only child…

668
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,458
Completely spoilt…

669
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:20,625
Before marriage, her father was tortured…

670
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:24,208
Then I married her…
same with me…

671
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,250
In this entire house…
my wife reigns…

672
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:32,000
It is her autocratic rule here…

673
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,500
Can you really say all this outside?
No no… you can't…

674
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:39,958
If there is one thing out of place…
My wife completely loses it!

675
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,041
It's such an embarrassment!
Nuisance!

676
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:46,375
At times, I feel like giving her…

677
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:50,083
a little lesson…

678
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:51,291
But...

679
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:54,541
I can't hit a woman, being a man…

680
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:57,125
On top of that…
I'm the councillor…

681
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,333
Sister in state… wife at home…

682
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,333
Complete female domination…

683
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,666
Amidst all this…

684
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,458
your wife…

685
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,291
Complete Warrior Queen…

686
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:18,916
Such a thrashing!
Hair in my hand…

687
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:24,125
Sir… here are some sweets from
Banchharam for you…

688
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:26,458
And a saree from Priyo Gopal Bishoyi…

689
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,500
No… no… none of this…
This is for your wife…

690
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,291
No no… we need nothing…

691
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,750
Today onwards, your wife
is like an elder sister to me…

692
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,500
No, but sir… you're
much senior in age…

693
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:40,625
Not age… it is about respect…

694
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,250
What is her name?
Mitali…

695
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:49,333
Mitali! See… Mitali Raj…
Captain of our Indian Cricket team…

696
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:54,916
Centre, state, field, home…
It is the 'M' that is ruling…

697
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,666
M stands for Master…

698
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:04,250
This saree and sweets are for Mitali…

699
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:07,833
But sir… all this is for you…

700
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:11,416
Get that... there's more!

701
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,416
Tell me later… Get that horse…

702
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:18,041
This is a small gesture on my side…

703
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,666
This horse is from my end…

704
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,291
Sir… your wife…

705
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,791
Take this… from my end…

706
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,166
Sir… but… What?

707
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,750
I'll skin you alive!
Break this on your head!

708
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,208
Break your head!

709
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,875
I'll break all your teeth and
throw your tongue in the river!

710
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:39,666
What do you think?
Sir… but you have changed!

711
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:42,583
Laltu Biswas…
This is how you treat people!

712
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:47,416
I'll murder you in broad daylight!
Sir... you've changed completely…

713
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,416
Even the sniffer dogs won't find you…
Is she gone?

714
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,416
You were such a nice person
a while back…

715
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:55,333
Sir… Shut up!

716
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,791
Dirty politics with me?
No…no… no sir…

717
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:01,208
Complete silence!

718
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,833
I will skin you alive remember!
I should never see you around.

719
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,958
You have no idea how
dangerous I am…

720
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,250
Beware! No smart acts!

721
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,958
Do you know whom you have touched!
Sir… sir…

722
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,083
I'll skin you alive...

723
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:19,708
I will throw you out of the city…
You were such a good man sir…

724
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,791
Shhh… sh…

725
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:24,500
Is she gone?
Why did you change like this?

726
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,166
Quiet… quiet…

727
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:30,041
Listen… please leave…
Take all these and leave…

728
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:37,500
Also just stay away from my wife…
The further you stay, the better…Please go…

729
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,708
I warn you! You stand warned!

730
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,666
You don't know me…

731
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,958
I shouldn't ever see you around!

732
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:48,791
Gone?
Yeah…

733
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,541
Get me some water…

734
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,916
Hey you… listen to me…

735
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:11,375
You're my love…
do you know that?

736
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:14,666
They sent these back?

737
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,791
No… no… no…

738
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,125
What did he say?

739
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:20,541
Councillor hugged me tight!

740
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,500
What did he say?

741
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,250
He has thanked you…

742
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,000
For beating his wife…

743
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,958
And has said that
you're his elder sister…

744
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,333
What?
Mitali!

745
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,375
O Mitali… O Mitali…

746
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,916
Have you gone completely mad?

747
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:51,208
You're the evening sky for me…

748
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,916
You're all that I want…

749
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:05,250
Actually Scar had pushed Mufasa down…

750
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:09,708
But when Simba saw that Nala has come…

751
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,666
Simba was really happy but
he couldn't recognize her at first…

752
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:18,750
Then when they were playing
together… Nala looked at him…

753
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:24,041
And Simba recognizes her…
his childhood friend…

754
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:30,333
Then they went to
the jungle to play…

755
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,875
Mummy, what is pregnant?

756
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:36,791
Tell me, Mummy…
what is pregnant?

757
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,833
What has happened to Khusi aunty?

758
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:51,416
Rono Uncle and Khusi Aunty
are going to have a baby…

759
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,541
How will that happen?

760
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:09,166
Rono Uncle, you see,
loves Khusi Aunty a lot…

761
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:15,500
So…Rono Uncle thought…
why not give her a gift?

762
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:22,833
After all, they are best friends…

763
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:26,291
So, Rono Uncle gave Khusi
Aunty a peck on the cheek!

764
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:30,875
Now, Khusi Aunty is pregnant!

765
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,583
So much fun! Yay!

766
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,208
Let's sleep…

767
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,416
Thank you…

768
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,791
Happy Friendship Day…

769
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,541
Where's mine?

770
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:58,208
Wait… I have
one for you as well…

771
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:13,250
Happy Friendship Day…

772
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:40,125
Ajaatshotru… what happened?

773
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,166
Ma'am…!

774
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:45,208
Bodhiswatto has
given Tanuruchi a peck!

775
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,708
What?

776
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,250
Bodhiswatto has given Tanuruchi a peck!

777
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,208
He has kissed her…

778
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,416
Kissed her...

779
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:00,375
so what?

780
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:02,583
I can, also, kiss you…

781
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,500
Haven't I kissed you?

782
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,791
Friends do kiss each other…

783
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,208
This is not the same kiss…

784
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,375
Not the same one? Then?

785
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,375
This is the BF –GF kiss…

786
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:19,875
What is that?

787
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,208
Oh god… you know nothing…

788
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:26,875
The one that a boyfriend
gives a girlfriend…

789
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:30,541
Boyfriend girlfriend kiss… Ajaatshotru…

790
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:36,125
I really didn't know about this…
I'm so sorry… come here…

791
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:44,958
The covered parts of our body…

792
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,208
are called private parts…

793
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:52,458
And the uncovered parts
are called outside parts…

794
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,916
Now, if someone touches you
on the outside part…

795
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,458
It's a good touch…

796
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,416
But, if someone touches your
private parts…
that's bad touch…

797
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:04,875
Now, we shall make a safety circle…

798
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:06,500
Safety circle…

799
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:08,916
within which we are safe…

800
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:12,166
All of us have a safety circle…

801
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,625
Who all belong there?

802
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:21,500
Our dad, mom, grandparents
and teachers… ok?

803
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,416
Understood?

804
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:24,625
Miss… Yes… tell me…

805
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:25,791
I'm pregnant…

806
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,166
What?

807
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,625
I'm pregnant…

808
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,083
Come on… properly…Hands straight, Ahana!

809
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:01,166
Tanuruchi…

810
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:07,958
So you're pregnant?
Hmmm…

811
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,708
How did you know that?

812
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,750
Mummy told me…

813
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:17,416
Mummy told you that
you're pregnant?

814
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,833
Hmmm…

815
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,916
Khusi Aunty is pregnant…

816
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:28,291
Mummy was happily telling everyone…

817
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:31,041
She was dancing with joy…

818
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,083
Then I asked Mummy,
what is pregnant…

819
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:37,916
Then she told me that
Rono Uncle and Khusi Aunty…

820
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:40,666
Both are best friends…

821
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:44,250
Rono Uncle loves
Khusi Aunty a lot…

822
01:01:44,291 --> 01:01:47,875
He kissed Khusi aunty
on her cheek and that's it…

823
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,000
Khusi aunty is pregnant.

824
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:52,625
Okay…

825
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:55,375
So, who kissed you on the cheek?

826
01:01:57,166 --> 01:01:58,875
Bodhiswatto…

827
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:01,750
Bodhiswatto and I are best friends…

828
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:05,916
I love him a lot… so does he…

829
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:10,083
Today is Friendship day…
I tied a friendship band on him today…

830
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:14,250
And he kissed me on my cheek…
That's it… I'm also pregnant…

831
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:20,833
Okay… you may go now…

832
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:30,541
Call Tanuruchi's parents over…

833
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:33,833
Also inform Bodhiswatto's parents…

834
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:37,750
Shouldn't we explain to her…
what is pregnancy?

835
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:41,583
See… I think we should
leave it at this…

836
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:44,541
If there is something more
to be explained…

837
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:46,625
It should be explained by her mother…

838
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,875
It's a very sensitive area…

839
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:52,291
If we say more…
she might get conscious…

840
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,625
And Bodhiswatto?
He has become insufferable…

841
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:58,166
Every issue is about him…

842
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,875
Why didn't you put
potato in the chowmein?

843
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,083
I put eggs, instead…

844
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,500
No… but why not potatoes?
I did put eggs…

845
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,958
No… Shh!

846
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,708
Tanuruchi's parents right?

847
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,791
Hey Kuchu… be careful…

848
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:20,166
Shyamoli Rakshit…
My husband is the local councillor…

849
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:20,875
Oh…

850
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:25,666
I heard about your daughter's case…
My son caught them…

851
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:27,250
What a mess!

852
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:29,666
What a dangerous child he is!

853
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:33,208
Bodhiswatto…
he has beaten up my child before…

854
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:37,958
And his mother…
such a disgusting lady…

855
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,500
She insulted me publicly…
even became violent…

856
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:45,791
Actually, nouveau-riche…
Not classy like you and me…

857
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:48,708
You lose your own respect
arguing with them…

858
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,083
Ask the principal to
rusticate Bodhiswatto…

859
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,916
Oh… the main thing…
I'll add you on whatsapp…

860
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:59,375
Kuchu… he is so naughty!
Wait for me.

861
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,708
Did you see her attitude?

862
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:12,291
Witch!

863
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:16,375
Can't stand her!
Backbiter!

864
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:21,208
So should we have a pizza treat today?
Yeah…

865
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,750
Which one do you want?

866
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:25,291
This is utterly shocking…

867
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,208
I can't even imagine…

868
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:32,666
A small child… as innocent as a flower…
A guy kissed her in school…

869
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:36,750
You are calling this a normal thing?
Hushing it up saying it's a simple issue..

870
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:41,875
I mean…scared of
your school's reputation?

871
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:45,500
I will be forced to take it
up on a public platform…

872
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:49,000
I think you might just be
overreacting a little…

873
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,750
See… first of all…
it's not a kiss…

874
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:56,375
Oh? it's not a kiss?

875
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,708
I mean… it is not
exactly a kiss…

876
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,666
What we usually mean by a kiss…

877
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,833
What is it then?

878
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,291
See in a child's world
this is just a peck...

879
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:12,250
I mean that is what
Tanuruchi told us…

880
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:16,625
And Ajaatshotru… the one who reported
the incident…
also said the same thing…

881
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:22,166
So, what is the actual difference
between these two?

882
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:30,958
See a peck is something that children,
playfully give on each other's cheeks.

883
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,750
It can be on the forehead…
it's more affectionate than anything else…

884
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,833
Man-woman passion is not evident here...

885
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:48,083
And a kiss is…
well, all of us are adults here…

886
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:52,833
A kiss is about that passion…

887
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:58,791
See… on friendship day…
everybody hugged each other…

888
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,500
They've exchanged friendship bands…

889
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:05,666
What happened as a result of
that shouldn't be taken seriously…

890
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:14,166
And if we delve further into this…
children will get, unnecessarily, curious…

891
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:17,208
We should, actually, drop it right here…

892
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:22,750
You must be celebrating
everything here?

893
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:26,791
Rose day, Friendship
day, Valentine's day...

894
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:29,666
What else will my daughter
learn and experience…

895
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:32,041
Is becoming a point of concern for me…

896
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:36,958
Mrs Sen… your daughter didn't learn
the word 'pregnant' from school…

897
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,625
That's perfectly normal…
No… just a minute…

898
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:44,166
Also, nobody explained
the word to her in school…

899
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,000
And the kiss?

900
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,375
Nope…

901
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:49,875
What was it?

902
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:51,541
A peck...

903
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:56,125
Yes… the affectionate
peck… that?

904
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:01,083
Where did she learn that?

905
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:05,166
See there are a lot of complaints
against this boy…

906
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,666
Many guardians informed us…

907
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,125
In fact, warned us against him…

908
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,083
You have to separate my
daughter from this boy…

909
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:17,666
I mean, they shouldn't be in
the same section anymore…

910
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:23,375
Stone… paper… scissor… cut…

911
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:29,875
Chini… come on…
where's your bag?

912
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:33,375
Mummy… he is Bodhiswatto…
My best friend…

913
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,666
Bodhiswatto?

914
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:41,416
You have a lot of tricks
up your sleeves, no?

915
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,833
What? What tricks?

916
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:49,541
Your son?

917
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:53,958
What do you do?

918
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,791
I run a furniture business…
I have a 1000 sq. ft showroom in Kasba…

919
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,333
And one at Howrah as well…

920
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,541
How could you do this?

921
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,500
Put these two children together?

922
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:11,250
A professor's child and a furniture shop
owner's child placed together…

923
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,500
Isn't it a little cheap?

924
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:17,375
I asked you to get your bag…
Let's go… come on..

925
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:19,291
Can I say something to you?

926
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,208
Being a professor yourself,
how could you say this?

927
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:22,958
Meaning?

928
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,166
We don't treat children
according to their background…

929
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:29,250
They also don't become friends,
according to status…

930
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:30,375
Thank you very much…

931
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:32,750
Okay… okay… Nice talking to you…

932
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:35,708
Come inside please…

933
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,208
Archana… please look after
Bodhiswatto for a while…

934
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,875
Ok ma'am…

935
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:47,041
Bodhiswatto… come with me…

936
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,666
Come on…

937
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,583
What's wrong?

938
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,250
Please sit…

939
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:11,958
Good… Come in…

940
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,666
Your son…

941
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,625
Is the Dude…

942
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,000
A Salman Khan fan…

943
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,500
Bodhiswatto Biswas means
towel dance…

944
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:38,083
What is he doing? Always fighting…

945
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,500
Spraying water on others…

946
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:43,500
Getting an expensive phone to school…

947
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:47,541
Not at all attentive in class…

948
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:53,041
He is kissing and
hugging other students…

949
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,333
All issues are about one person…

950
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:57,125
Bodhiswatto…

951
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,958
Can you tell me what to do with him?

952
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,875
There are so many complaints against him…

953
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,916
I'm sorry… but we can't keep him here…

954
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:07,875
Don't do this ma'am…

955
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,625
Please not this…

956
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:12,125
We got him admitted with
so much difficulty…

957
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,041
All will be lost…

958
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,166
Everything will be gone…

959
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,833
Bhutu is not to be blamed, ma'am…

960
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,291
All of it is my fault…

961
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:23,041
What are you saying?
Yes… it is all my fault…

962
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:24,708
He has got all of this from me…

963
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,625
What are you even saying?
Please let me talk…

964
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:29,833
I'm confessing today ma'am…

965
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,958
In front of you all…

966
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,250
That I was a very bad student in school…

967
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:37,708
I was a notorious child…

968
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,541
What are you doing?

969
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:43,875
Let me speak…

970
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,750
Ma'am...

971
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:50,208
After all, children carry
their parents' genes.

972
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:56,791
In school, I used to draw naughty
pictures in the washroom.

973
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:03,166
I got naughty books to school…
got caught also…

974
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:10,416
During Saraswati Puja
I went to the girl's school…

975
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:11,958
Been naughty there too…

976
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:18,375
Have stolen books from the school library…

977
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:22,750
Have stolen and sold off sweets during
Saraswati Puja...

978
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:24,791
Mr Biswas, please listen…

979
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:28,208
No, please, let me finish…

980
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,416
Ma'am… today I shall…

981
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:36,208
My wife doesn't know all this ma'am…

982
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,875
But, today, I'm confessing ma'am…

983
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:41,708
That I've cheated during exams.

984
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:46,583
I've been punished ma'am…

985
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:52,416
I used to get bruised
with all the punishments.

986
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,958
The teachers have pulled my sideburns…

987
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,833
Have broken canes on my back…

988
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:04,583
But, one thing, I can proudly say is…

989
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:08,083
I never got thrown
out of school ma'am…

990
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:11,166
Never been transferred…

991
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:15,041
Even today, when I meet my teacher…

992
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:19,125
He proudly hugs me…

993
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:24,083
He says there was innocence
in your naughtiness!

994
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:27,000
I ask him to pull
my side burns, once again.

995
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:36,083
One request ma'am…
don't throw my child out of school…

996
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,125
Beat him… scold him…

997
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:42,541
Punish him… do whatever…

998
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,375
He is, actually, your child, right?

999
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:47,833
Mr Biswas … please sit down…

1000
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:52,791
Please try and understand something…

1001
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:56,333
Times were different when
you were in school…

1002
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,375
It's a different time now…Right?

1003
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:03,291
Bodhiswatto's naughtiness…

1004
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:06,458
Why will other students and
guardians tolerate that?

1005
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,333
Ma'am…

1006
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,333
From today onwards…
Bodhiswatto's responsibility is yours…

1007
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,416
You are, after all, his mother, right?

1008
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:14,166
Yes…

1009
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:15,541
Hey… I'm his mother…

1010
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:16,666
Oh…

1011
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,208
No, I am not Bodhiswatto's mother…

1012
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:24,750
You're misunderstanding, Mr Biswas…

1013
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:28,791
See, as much as it is
the school's responsibility…

1014
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:32,833
50% of it is of the parents…

1015
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:36,083
This is his last chance…

1016
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,541
Today onwards…
no being the dude…

1017
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:41,666
No fighting…
no mobile…
and no TV…

1018
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:45,500
And Bodhiswatto has to be,
gradually, separated from Tanuruchi.

1019
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,750
There's one more thing…

1020
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:53,541
Naughty parents may not,
necessarily, beget naughty children.

1021
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:55,208
Exactly…

1022
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,875
Also Bodhiswatto is an intelligent child…

1023
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:59,833
Such an young age…

1024
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:03,875
This is when you need to discipline him…

1025
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:08,333
See, children are like sponge…

1026
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:13,000
It is very important what they are
hearing… and watching…

1027
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,958
And Mrs Biswas…

1028
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:19,958
If your son watches his mother…

1029
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,541
Fighting with someone else's
mother… abusing her…

1030
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,291
What will he learn?

1031
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:41,083
We have to handle Tanuruchi's
case, rather, carefully…

1032
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:43,500
Good afternoon ma'am…
Good afternoon…

1033
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,458
Our school trustee board…

1034
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:50,708
Mr Dalmia… our school's image… prestige…
everything is at stake…

1035
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:54,625
They are very well-connected…

1036
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:58,833
I think… she should be shifted
to another section…

1037
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,166
That'd be better…

1038
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:04,916
But ma'am… I have friends here…
I don't want to go…

1039
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,833
I know…

1040
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:09,083
but you will make more friends…

1041
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:13,375
But ma'am… I don't want to go…
I want to stay in this class…

1042
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:18,416
You'll make a lot of new friends there…

1043
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:22,208
All new ones…come along with me…

1044
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:28,458
Come…come on…

1045
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,291
So class, what were we studying?

1046
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,833
Tables!

1047
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:45,166
3x1=3

1048
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,333
3x2=6

1049
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,500
3x3=9

1050
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,791
3x4=12

1051
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:02,375
May I?

1052
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:04,208
I have a question to ask…

1053
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,916
You have questions about
everything…go ahead…

1054
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:11,708
Why did they take away Chini
to another class?

1055
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:13,458
How would I know that?

1056
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,375
Tell me why…

1057
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:16,750
How am I supposed to know?

1058
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,500
Is it because I kissed her?

1059
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:23,625
I wouldn't know…

1060
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,916
You also hug Mum…

1061
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:30,666
Kiss her…nobody separates you…

1062
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:34,875
Nobody is asking Mum to
stay in a different room…

1063
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:38,833
Everything has a rule…
come on eat.

1064
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:41,416
Mum and I are married…We are staying
together as a married couple…

1065
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:44,666
Grow up… I'll explain it to you…

1066
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:46,708
Open your mouth…

1067
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:57,166
And if I marry Chini?

1068
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:01,041
How terrible!

1069
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:05,375
It started with a kiss…
Now, he wants to marry…

1070
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,750
Hey… listen… look here…

1071
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,791
Look at me… what do you want?

1072
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:19,083
Because of all this nonsense…
nobody will sit or mix with you…

1073
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:21,583
He is becoming a know-it-all…

1074
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:23,791
Do you know?

1075
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:27,541
All because of you, we were
insulted by the Principal today.

1076
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:31,041
Let me make this clear, Bhutu…

1077
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:35,083
If you ever talk to that girl…
or play with her…

1078
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,541
I'll send you to a boarding school…

1079
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,083
Straight away…

1080
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:40,750
Now open your mouth… wide open…

1081
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:48,791
Wherever you are,
please come by,
Do look back.

1082
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:57,875
The cloudy heart is melting away
Across the skyline
wherever you are.

1083
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:24,041
However, run back to me
If you can...

1084
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:32,708
You are the solitary
tear
on my cheek...

1085
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:41,500
Lonely lunch times
Lonely school corridors...

1086
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:50,000
Fighting with my shadow
how do I see you...

1087
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:59,291
My lunch box is always there for you

1088
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:08,333
I shall share it just with you.

1089
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:35,375
Will you be my friend?
Let's again be friends.

1090
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:53,708
Memories of stone, paper, scissor
in my lunch box...

1091
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,041
Don't you want to talk to me?

1092
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:29,000
Why aren't you talking to me?

1093
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,708
Won't you speak to me?

1094
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,833
Your parents don't want me to talk to you…

1095
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:46,125
If I talk to you…
Your parents will complain…

1096
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:50,833
And if I play with you…
they will throw me out of school…

1097
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:55,375
And my mother has already told me…
they'll send me to a boarding school…

1098
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:50,958
Madam...

1099
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:54,416
An entire mob of guardians have
gathered at the school gate…

1100
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,583
They are trying to break down the gate…

1101
01:21:56,666 --> 01:22:00,041
Please ma'am… please check
once on the CC TV…

1102
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:02,583
Put the outer zone once…

1103
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:07,916
Oh God!

1104
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:08,958
Oh my God!

1105
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,125
Ma'am…

1106
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,541
Let's go…

1107
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,708
The school has been
surrounded by guardians…

1108
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,625
There's an angry mob outside…

1109
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,708
Come fast…let's go…

1110
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:39,416
Come down… come down at once…

1111
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:49,875
I want to go home.
Calm down everyone…
quiet please…

1112
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:52,958
Don't let the children out…
there's a lot of chaos outside…

1113
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:57,250
No talk... come out at once!

1114
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,875
Don't be afraid ...I'm here.

1115
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:27,000
Arundhati, call the police immediately…

1116
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,750
Just inform the police…

1117
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:35,291
Please… please listen…

1118
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:38,125
Silence please.

1119
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:39,708
If anybody is at fault…

1120
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:45,416
We shall ensure he gets punished…
But the children are getting scared…

1121
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:54,666
Please calm down a little…
the children are getting scared…

1122
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:57,875
You have to understand that…
we are giving you our word…

1123
01:23:57,875 --> 01:24:00,625
We shall, definitely, punish the offender…

1124
01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:13,916
The bus stopped in front
of the school gate…

1125
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:18,041
All the children got off…
just one small kid refused to do so…

1126
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:20,541
So, Chachajaan was trying to
get her to alight…

1127
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:25,916
Now, the guardians are insinuating that…
he has done something wrong…

1128
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:29,166
They are demanding that Chachajaan
should be
handed over to them…

1129
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,958
Post this on Facebook.

1130
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:35,208
The police is here…

1131
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:47,500
We'll look into it…
please calm down…

1132
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:56,625
He is here…
Who is the principal?

1133
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:58,500
I am…

1134
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:01,291
The child has to be sent to
the hospital immediately…

1135
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,208
Are her parents coming?

1136
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:03,916
Yes, they are.

1137
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:06,666
Doctor's report is required regarding
what exactly has happened…

1138
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,958
And I would need all the CCTV footage…

1139
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,541
We will have to take the driver
and the helper into custody…

1140
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,333
We are already taking her to the hospital…

1141
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:16,333
We don't have CC cameras on the bus…

1142
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:20,416
Otherwise whatever CCTV footage we have
in school…we can provide all that…

1143
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,416
Oh, my god!

1144
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:27,708
Please bring in extra force… the
situation is really getting out of hand…

1145
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:29,833
I have given instructions,
the area will be cordoned off.

1146
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,416
Don't worry at all…

1147
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:42,958
Please please… don't enter like this…

1148
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:46,666
Just a minute…

1149
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,000
What happened?
Where is my daughter?

1150
01:25:49,041 --> 01:25:50,291
Just a minute please…
Please come inside…

1151
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:51,833
No… but what are they saying…
What happened?

1152
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:53,875
No… but what are they saying…
what happened?

1153
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:55,875
Please, come inside.

1154
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:00,875
Please don't record all this…
Don't spread rumours… please…

1155
01:26:22,458 --> 01:26:24,625
Who is from Jhumur Pal's family?

1156
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:27,958
Jhumur Pal's family?

1157
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:30,375
Please come with me…

1158
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:39,625
The child doesn't have any sign of
molestation on her body…

1159
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:42,166
She is absolutely fine…

1160
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:46,791
There is no sign of any injury
or penetration…
nothing…

1161
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:52,958
But, actually, she is very traumatized…
she is scared for some reason…

1162
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,625
You may take her home…
but keep a watch on her…

1163
01:26:56,708 --> 01:27:00,708
Try to find out why she is traumatized…

1164
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:03,000
Please don't cry…

1165
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,166
The good thing is ma'am…
your daughter is completely fine…

1166
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:10,625
I'll write that down in the report…

1167
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:16,291
Thank you… Please don't worry…

1168
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:20,250
Arundhati… I think we should visit
the police station once…

1169
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:21,666
Yeah ma'am…

1170
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:28,416
Another case of sexual abuse
in a reputed school...

1171
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:32,541
Mummum… what
happened to Chachajaan?

1172
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:37,291
Why was everybody beating him?
Why?

1173
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:42,916
Parents and school authorites
get into heated arguments.

1174
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:46,958
Two people have been arrested.

1175
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:52,416
Complaint lodged about a Class 1
student being molested.

1176
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:55,750
What is molestation?

1177
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,625
Ma'am… like every other day…
the bus stopped…

1178
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:20,750
All the children got off…

1179
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:25,000
I went inside the bus, like I usually do…

1180
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:26,916
To check on the children…

1181
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:33,250
So, I saw one child sitting there,
hiding her face and crying…

1182
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,041
I went nearer and saw…

1183
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:37,791
She was hiding her face
behind the bag and crying…

1184
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:40,708
I lifted her face and
saw it was Jhumur Pal…

1185
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:47,291
That child used to get me
gifts on her birthday…

1186
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:51,500
So I asked her…
what is it darling?

1187
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:54,333
Why are you crying?
Has anybody scolded you?

1188
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:55,583
Won't you go to school?

1189
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,875
Then, I saw she was crying more…

1190
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:00,375
When I tried to pull her close,
she kept resisting…

1191
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:06,291
So I took her in my lap…
and asked
her, what is wrong, my dear?

1192
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:09,125
Has anybody scolded you?
Won't you go to school?

1193
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:12,416
Suddenly, a woman came inside…

1194
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:14,500
And started shouting loudly…

1195
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:19,583
"What are you doing?
Shameless… you should be ashamed!"

1196
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:23,500
"Don't you have a granddaughter?"
She started saying all that…

1197
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:25,416
I was so shocked…

1198
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:30,708
I lost my voice…

1199
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:35,083
These children at school
are like my grandchildren…

1200
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,500
What could I have answered?

1201
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:40,458
37 years…

1202
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,875
37 years…I have been
working here for 37 years…

1203
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:48,416
Nobody has asked me
such questions till date…

1204
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,125
Never…

1205
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:52,625
I haven't done anything wrong, ma'am…

1206
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:59,583
The child's mother has lodged
a complaint against them…

1207
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:05,166
Ask them to give me a copy of the medical
report and withdraw the complaint…

1208
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,833
Then, I can let them go…

1209
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:08,916
But that has to be done
as soon as possible…

1210
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:11,500
Ok… thank you… thank you

1211
01:30:11,583 --> 01:30:13,208
Let's go.

1212
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:27,083
Facebook and whatsapp
is full of this news…

1213
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:30,125
Even I'm getting them...

1214
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,833
There are 178 cameras in school…

1215
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:38,708
Every moment… every second
is being monitored…

1216
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,500
Tell me something, Arundhati…

1217
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:44,750
Are we teaching children…
or catching terrorists?

1218
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,791
Exactly so…

1219
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:50,041
Where were CCTVs in our days?

1220
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:53,375
Where were psychometric tests?

1221
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:57,458
All we had is trust…

1222
01:30:57,541 --> 01:31:00,291
Between parents and schools…

1223
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:05,208
What a difficult time this is...

1224
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:17,458
Actually...

1225
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,250
She had soiled her clothes…

1226
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:23,916
After all, she's a child...

1227
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:32,583
Her undergarments… skirt…
everything was wet…

1228
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:34,916
She was scared to get off…

1229
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:39,750
She was worried that her
friends would laugh…

1230
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:42,958
She started crying because of that…

1231
01:31:46,458 --> 01:31:48,791
If the teacher scolds…

1232
01:31:48,833 --> 01:31:51,291
she was worried.

1233
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:54,000
That is when… that…

1234
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:55,416
Chachajaan…

1235
01:31:55,458 --> 01:32:00,125
At that moment, Chachajaan went and
asked her what was wrong?

1236
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:03,541
She got all the more scared…

1237
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:06,916
She started resisting…

1238
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:11,125
Didn't understand what to do…

1239
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:15,000
No no… he did what
he should have…

1240
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:18,833
He was right in asking
what happened…

1241
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:24,375
She reacted so much…
cried so hard…

1242
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:33,541
That misled everyone…

1243
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:38,375
Obviously… she is a small child…

1244
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:39,708
How can she be blamed?

1245
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:58,416
We had a request…
now, that
you know the whole thing…

1246
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:01,833
You'll get the hospital reports.

1247
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:07,250
If you could, kindly, withdraw your
complaint from the police station...

1248
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:10,916
the driver and
the helper will be set free.

1249
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:24,458
Don't fold your hands like that…
please don't do that…

1250
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:27,291
You have been here in this school…
longer than I have.

1251
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:32,041
I've decided, ma'am…

1252
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:36,625
There's no point working somewhere…
where there is no trust…

1253
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:38,833
I don't wish to continue…

1254
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:44,458
Ok fine… come along with me

1255
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,000
Good morning, children…

1256
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:02,083
Good morning, ma'am…

1257
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:04,291
Who is standing beside me?

1258
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:06,125
Chachaji (uncle)…

1259
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,333
But Chachaji is leaving us today…

1260
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,083
Do you wish to say something to him?

1261
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:19,791
Yes…

1262
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:26,875
Beside me…
On the green grass meadow…

1263
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:32,916
The stories roll in laughter
At the love that we have for you…

1264
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:41,541
Buses drive past…
As the windows smile…

1265
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:46,125
At the love that we have for you…

1266
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:53,291
We forget which way…
Is your home…

1267
01:34:57,375 --> 01:35:02,625
As you disappear in the crowd…

1268
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:08,250
Will you not hold my hands?

1269
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,416
Dear Uncle…

1270
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:16,041
You're the dearest…

1271
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:37,791
All we can say that…
we will never... never... never

1272
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,291
Let you go…

1273
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:10,083
Tomorrow, you said,
The day went to bed...

1274
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:15,750
The day after, did you say
Years passed in play...

1275
01:36:15,791 --> 01:36:22,083
Today did you say,
You ruled the world your way.

1276
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:26,291
And you are off today…

1277
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:31,041
Whose hands are you holding now?

1278
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:38,583
Birthdays remember your gift…

1279
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:42,041
Won't you give another flower?

1280
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:51,916
Dear Uncle… you're the dearest…

1281
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:13,791
All we can say that…
we will never... never... never

1282
01:37:13,833 --> 01:37:17,541
Let you go…

1283
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:22,791
72% parents in India…

1284
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:25,875
Don't trust schools anymore…

1285
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:30,708
Even in our school... a very disturbing
incident has taken place recently…

1286
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:36,458
Actually… if there is no trust
between schools and the parents…

1287
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:38,833
Could you please pass the microphone?

1288
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:40,875
I have something to say…

1289
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:46,125
Why shouldn't we be having trust issues?

1290
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:51,041
We leave the children with you for 6 hours…

1291
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:52,583
Why?

1292
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,500
Because we believe that
the child will be safe…

1293
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,458
There were 44 children in class…
now, that has gone up to 65…

1294
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:03,625
Can you pay attention to everyone, equally?

1295
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:07,791
You yourself accept that you can't…

1296
01:38:07,833 --> 01:38:10,916
If a child gets hurt,
do you take responsibility?

1297
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:16,875
Before calling the guardian, you
plan the whole thing…

1298
01:38:16,916 --> 01:38:20,625
What will you say…
how much will you say…

1299
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:26,166
Then prepare the story in such a way…
that all the fault lies with the parents…

1300
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:29,000
Ma'am… you're teaching
safety circles in school…

1301
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:32,958
Who all belong to that group?
Parents…

1302
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,500
grandparents…and...

1303
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:37,166
Teachers!

1304
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:39,250
Oh my god!
But teachers aren't safe, nowadays…

1305
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,083
And non-teaching staff…

1306
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,875
bad…

1307
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:45,000
Then where is the safety?

1308
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,416
Whom do we trust?

1309
01:38:52,416 --> 01:38:54,583
I think… mic please…

1310
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:05,958
I think the CC cameras
can solve this…

1311
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,916
And, in the same context,
I would like to add...

1312
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:14,333
It'd be better if we could get
CC cameras, installed in buses as well…

1313
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:16,791
There'll be a constant monitoring…

1314
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:19,833
Also, you might agree to this…
lady attendants…

1315
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:21,500
Yes… yes right…

1316
01:39:21,583 --> 01:39:26,208
They touch the children…
there's an intimate connection…

1317
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:29,500
So, if we could get lady attendants…
thank you…

1318
01:39:30,791 --> 01:39:32,166
Okay…

1319
01:39:32,208 --> 01:39:35,083
178 CC cameras will become 225…

1320
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:38,583
And each bus will have 2 cameras…

1321
01:39:38,666 --> 01:39:40,250
… gprs system…

1322
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:44,375
Lady attendant will be made mandatory...

1323
01:39:44,416 --> 01:39:45,625
Thank you…

1324
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:50,958
But will close circuit
cameras solve the issue?

1325
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:58,500
I really don't think so…

1326
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:02,291
A prison or a correctional home…
doesn't have so many cameras…

1327
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:04,458
Yes, but the criminals there…thank you…

1328
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:07,916
The criminals in prisons…
are known criminals…

1329
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:13,875
The teaching or non-teaching staff…
or friends of same age group…

1330
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:17,791
If they have a criminal mentality…
or tendencies…

1331
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:20,750
That is unknown…
and that is very dangerous…

1332
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:25,791
I mean… an unwarranted
touch in the childhood…

1333
01:40:25,791 --> 01:40:30,333
A kiss… even sexual abuse…
so much is happening…

1334
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:32,625
That will scar a child for life…

1335
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:36,250
They will have to bear that
burden all their lives…

1336
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:39,416
So, please don't mix these up, kindly…

1337
01:40:40,958 --> 01:40:43,125
If required 500 CC cameras
might be needed to be installed.

1338
01:40:43,166 --> 01:40:45,916
Right… if it is for
our children's safety…

1339
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:47,958
That's all… thank you…

1340
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:55,833
See, all professions have a few bad elements…
and because of them, others have to suffer…

1341
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:57,916
But my question is…

1342
01:40:57,958 --> 01:41:02,333
For a few dishonest people and
a school's carelessness,

1343
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:06,666
should the entire system be mistrusted?

1344
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:10,500
Then, how will we, even, keep
the children in school?

1345
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:15,500
Believe me… teachers are
scared to teach these days…

1346
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:20,791
Non-teaching staff is scared
to touch the children…

1347
01:41:20,833 --> 01:41:23,083
They are not ready to take responsibility…

1348
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:27,208
Nowadays, education is no longer
the main focus in schools…

1349
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:31,416
Solving these issues have become
the main focus…

1350
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:34,375
I mean, academics has taken a back seat…

1351
01:41:34,416 --> 01:41:36,416
That's really unfortunate…

1352
01:41:37,708 --> 01:41:42,083
Come on… let's bring back the sacred
relationship of the earlier days,

1353
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:46,208
between teacher and student.
Where we will be able to teach…

1354
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:48,958
discipline them, without fear…

1355
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,916
Actually, I have something to say…

1356
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:53,500
Yes, please…

1357
01:41:57,291 --> 01:42:00,208
Can I just…?
Please…

1358
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,791
There she is…
Jhumur Pal's mother…

1359
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:11,041
May I?

1360
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:13,916
Is she that child's mother?
I guess so…

1361
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:18,291
A few days back, I received
a message on my whatsapp…

1362
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:25,000
There was photo which showed a girl… clicking
a selfie with her father's dead body…

1363
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:31,375
And the caption said…
'Shame! Selfie with father's deadbody?'

1364
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:35,458
Naturally, this got circulated…

1365
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:38,083
Even I've passed it on…

1366
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:41,125
5 minutes later…

1367
01:42:41,125 --> 01:42:45,416
I received yet another message…
the same photo from the same number…

1368
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:49,500
But this time it was written…
there has been a mistake…

1369
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:51,416
Remember that whatsapp message…

1370
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:56,166
The girl wasn't actually taking a photo
with her father's deadbody…

1371
01:42:56,208 --> 01:42:58,791
Her brother lives in Kuwait…

1372
01:42:58,833 --> 01:43:03,666
She was sending photos of
the last rites to her brother…

1373
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:08,250
But, by then, it had been shared by many…

1374
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:12,833
Shameful… disgusting…
such were the captions…

1375
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:19,833
Maybe a lot of people didn't
even share the next photo…

1376
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:26,000
My daughter's incident
is also a lot like that…

1377
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,791
That day, a lot of people
condemned the incident...

1378
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:35,583
Yes… even I did that…

1379
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:38,750
I've written about it on Facebook…

1380
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:42,291
I've sent messages on
whatsapp to a lot of people…

1381
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:45,416
But I didn't try to learn the truth…

1382
01:43:47,916 --> 01:43:52,333
Honestly, my daughter's
incident is like a mirror to me…

1383
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:58,375
None of us thought about the school…

1384
01:43:58,375 --> 01:44:03,458
About the school's respect… reputation…

1385
01:44:03,541 --> 01:44:07,041
About the rest of the school's students…

1386
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:11,375
and most, importantly…about the man…

1387
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:15,208
… who for the past 35 years…

1388
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:23,250
has been, lovingly and safely,
escorting our children to school...

1389
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:27,083
We never thought about him…

1390
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,250
10 years down the line…

1391
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:33,291
When one of the guardians,
seeing my daughter says…

1392
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:36,000
pointing in this manner..

1393
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:37,875
"Look at her… that's Jhumur Pal…

1394
01:44:37,916 --> 01:44:40,958
She is the one with whom that
incident took place…"

1395
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,375
That won't be right…

1396
01:44:42,416 --> 01:44:47,583
Because I want all of you to know...

1397
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:52,291
Nothing happened to my daughter…

1398
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:58,458
Damaging whatsapp!

1399
01:45:03,666 --> 01:45:06,333
Nobody has harmed her in anyway…

1400
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:08,875
The whole thing is...

1401
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:12,666
a misunderstanding…

1402
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:19,708
My daughter is fine…

1403
01:45:26,958 --> 01:45:27,625
Thank you…

1404
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:30,541
Then, what are we deciding?

1405
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:32,666
Are we bringing Chachajaan
back to school?

1406
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:33,500
I don't need it…

1407
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:35,041
Bringing back or not?

1408
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:36,625
Yes yes…

1409
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:39,291
So, whoever, supports this, please
raise your hands…

1410
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:41,208
We are with you…

1411
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:51,583
What are you doing with that phone?
Raise your hand…

1412
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:56,791
Protocol should have been followed...
a lady attendant was not kept!

1413
01:45:56,833 --> 01:46:00,583
It can set a precedence…
after all, a rule is a rule…

1414
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:03,208
Ma'am… We are all with you…

1415
01:46:03,208 --> 01:46:04,833
We are all with the school…

1416
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:06,791
Right? Yes...

1417
01:46:12,916 --> 01:46:16,916
Love of my life…

1418
01:46:19,541 --> 01:46:23,791
My heart cries for you…

1419
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:35,500
Why is love so helpless?

1420
01:46:35,583 --> 01:46:41,416
Heart breaks and loses all hope…

1421
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:50,958
Wonderful!

1422
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:55,583
You here watching films and crying…

1423
01:46:55,625 --> 01:46:58,250
And there, your son is
also watching the same…

1424
01:46:58,250 --> 01:46:59,833
Oh… really?

1425
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:02,666
How am I supposed to know, tell me…

1426
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:04,583
You won't know?

1427
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:06,666
Didn't the school ask you to
stop watching all this?

1428
01:47:09,541 --> 01:47:13,625
I've stopped watching TV serials
in the afternoon…

1429
01:47:13,666 --> 01:47:16,416
The film came on TV after so long…

1430
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:20,791
What a great movie!

1431
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:26,916
Excellent movie… brilliant!

1432
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:35,000
Hey..who are you to talk like this?

1433
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:38,583
Who watches all those
Salman Khan films at night?

1434
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:41,541
Don't you and your son watch all that?
Did you stop that?

1435
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:47,583
You are responsible for him
being spoilt, understand?

1436
01:47:47,625 --> 01:47:49,791
Hey… what are you doing?

1437
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,750
I'm not responsible…

1438
01:48:09,875 --> 01:48:11,041
Seen Tanuruchi?

1439
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:28,041
The day we went…

1440
01:48:28,041 --> 01:48:31,041
The red ladder I mentioned…

1441
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:32,375
The way it was rotating…

1442
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:33,458
Come here…

1443
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:39,375
So when we were there…
It was rotating both ways.

1444
01:48:41,625 --> 01:48:44,916
Whoever is on it will get surprised!

1445
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:46,125
Come here…

1446
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:49,958
Wait… I'll come back…

1447
01:48:51,041 --> 01:48:53,291
What happened?

1448
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:05,208
What?

1449
01:49:11,041 --> 01:49:12,208
Wait...

1450
01:49:16,166 --> 01:49:17,875
What is this?

1451
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:19,291
This is vermillion…

1452
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:20,708
If I marry you…

1453
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,333
We get to stay in the same class…

1454
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:24,625
Nobody can separate us…

1455
01:49:26,458 --> 01:49:28,750
Bodhiswatta, you are mad…

1456
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:49,250
What happened?
Why are you panting?

1457
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:56,416
Bodhiswatto has married Tanuruchi…

1458
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,000
What?

1459
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,416
Bodhiswatto has married Tanuruchi…

1460
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,125
Where are they?
There…

1461
01:50:05,208 --> 01:50:07,208
Why are you crying?

1462
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:16,125
What happened?
Why on earth are you crying?

1463
01:50:16,166 --> 01:50:17,958
Come here… let me see…

1464
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,500
What! What have you done?

1465
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:22,416
I've married her…

1466
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,583
From today onwards…
we can be in the same class…

1467
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:27,083
No… here here… nothing happened…

1468
01:50:27,083 --> 01:50:31,000
Come on, baby…
we'll wash your face…

1469
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:37,708
What? What is this?

1470
01:50:37,708 --> 01:50:39,250
Let me see…

1471
01:50:40,625 --> 01:50:43,625
There's nothing to be scared off…
Let me see…

1472
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:47,583
Nothing has happened…

1473
01:50:50,875 --> 01:50:52,541
What did just happen?

1474
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:55,000
Even I wish to know that...
what, really, did happen?

1475
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,833
You tell me…

1476
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:57,750
See... you asked me not to play with her…

1477
01:50:57,791 --> 01:50:58,416
Yes…

1478
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,583
I didn't play… neither did I speak to her…

1479
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:04,625
But you did speak…
even went and met her…

1480
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:06,416
Where did you get the vermillion?

1481
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:07,750
It's Mum's…

1482
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:09,750
They were showing it in a film…

1483
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:14,833
In the film, Rahul puts vermillion on
Priyanka's forehead and
marries her…

1484
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:17,916
Nobody is being able to separate her…

1485
01:51:17,958 --> 01:51:22,958
I thought… if I marry Chini…
then, nobody can separate us

1486
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,458
We can, then, stay in the same class…

1487
01:51:28,625 --> 01:51:32,458
But Bodhiswatto…
the problem is elsewhere…

1488
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,583
What problem?

1489
01:51:33,625 --> 01:51:37,708
You had said that you'd marry me…
hadn't you?

1490
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:40,625
I had… I did say that…

1491
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,875
You are marrying Tanuruchi…

1492
01:51:42,875 --> 01:51:44,958
You have proposed marriage to me…

1493
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,333
Quite a problem!

1494
01:51:48,166 --> 01:51:50,041
Quite a problem!

1495
01:51:50,083 --> 01:51:51,791
Fine, you will marry her…

1496
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:54,750
But do you know how much
responsibility comes with it?

1497
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:56,791
You have to earn money…
What responsibility?

1498
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:58,708
You have to go shopping!

1499
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,000
Shopping?

1500
01:52:00,708 --> 01:52:02,041
Yes...

1501
01:52:02,041 --> 01:52:04,500
Whoever gets married has to go shopping…

1502
01:52:04,583 --> 01:52:06,416
Also you have to...

1503
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:09,083
buy clothes for her…

1504
01:52:09,083 --> 01:52:11,375
You have to buy her toys…

1505
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:14,250
You have to buy everything she loves…

1506
01:52:14,708 --> 01:52:17,291
You have to prepare food for her…

1507
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:19,041
Have to cook spaghetti…

1508
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:20,333
Spaghetti?

1509
01:52:20,375 --> 01:52:24,583
But I'm not grown up yet…
how will I earn?

1510
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:27,708
How am I supposed to know that?
If you don't earn, how will you marry?

1511
01:52:34,375 --> 01:52:37,458
So I'll postpone the wedding for a while…
That you decide…

1512
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:42,291
But let me tell you…
marriage
means a lot of responsibility…

1513
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:44,625
Then you have to buy a house…

1514
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:46,041
A television…

1515
01:52:47,875 --> 01:52:50,125
Very difficult…
difficult indeed…

1516
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:56,458
So I'll cancel the wedding
for the time being…

1517
01:52:56,541 --> 01:52:58,083
I agree...

1518
01:52:58,083 --> 01:52:59,791
I'll get married later…

1519
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:02,000
Too much responsibility… my God!

1520
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:07,250
Have to earn… make spaghetti…
go shopping as well…

1521
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:10,291
So you aren't marrying now?

1522
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:11,500
No…

1523
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:13,083
I'll do it later…
So the wedding is being called off?

1524
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:14,083
As of now cancelled…

1525
01:53:15,583 --> 01:53:19,416
And this thing should remain
between the three of us… ok?

1526
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:21,875
Absolutely… between the three of us…
Shhh…

1527
01:53:21,875 --> 01:53:24,791
No one else…

1528
01:53:24,833 --> 01:53:26,666
So I'll leave now?
Yes, please…

1529
01:53:29,208 --> 01:53:32,875
Well…is making spaghetti,
compulsory for marriage?

1530
01:53:32,916 --> 01:53:35,083
Making spaghetti is a must!

1531
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:07,958
It's so surprising!
You didn't even scold him a bit?

1532
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,583
What will I tell him?

1533
01:54:10,666 --> 01:54:14,708
While teaching here…
I've been
proposed marriage 5 times…

1534
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:18,708
Received proposals of love 25 times…
sometimes with an 'I love you'…

1535
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:21,833
Or with a leaf from a plant…or a drawing…

1536
01:54:21,875 --> 01:54:26,416
Flowers… mother's jewellery…
I've kept them all…

1537
01:54:27,375 --> 01:54:29,125
I think of them as compliments…

1538
01:54:31,041 --> 01:54:34,833
And when these children grow up…
I tease them and say…

1539
01:54:34,875 --> 01:54:38,583
Hey… do you remember?
I'm your first girlfriend…

1540
01:54:38,666 --> 01:54:41,916
You had proposed to me…
I'm your first crush…

1541
01:54:43,541 --> 01:54:48,375
Then they tell me…Please ma'am…
don't remind us of all that…

1542
01:54:48,375 --> 01:54:50,125
Sohini…

1543
01:54:50,166 --> 01:54:53,000
Tell me, how old is he?

1544
01:54:53,041 --> 01:54:54,916
He is a child…

1545
01:54:54,958 --> 01:54:57,125
Does he understand the meaning of marriage?

1546
01:54:57,166 --> 01:55:00,000
He did it playfully…
he'll forget about it in a few days…

1547
01:55:00,041 --> 01:55:03,541
If we scold him severely…
he'll get scared…

1548
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:09,083
See… he might be slightly
advanced…compared to others…

1549
01:55:09,083 --> 01:55:12,416
But he definitely doesn't understand
what he's doing…
and as a counselor…

1550
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:18,791
I'll never give you an opinion…
I'll make you understand your situation…

1551
01:55:18,791 --> 01:55:21,916
You'll understand by yourself…
the way he understood it…

1552
01:55:21,958 --> 01:55:24,875
That marriage is a pretty serious business…

1553
01:55:24,916 --> 01:55:27,666
There're a lot of responsibilities…
you have to earn money…

1554
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:30,708
There's an age to it…
he cancelled it himself…

1555
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:32,458
See… that's all…

1556
01:55:39,625 --> 01:55:40,916
Hey…

1557
01:55:40,916 --> 01:55:42,958
Whom did you put vermillion on?

1558
01:55:44,833 --> 01:55:46,583
What? What happened?

1559
01:55:46,666 --> 01:55:48,458
Yeah… he took vermillion from home…

1560
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:51,875
Took your vermillion
and put it on someone…

1561
01:55:51,875 --> 01:55:54,166
What will I do with this boy?

1562
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:58,791
One day, he kisses someone...
another day, he puts vermillion…

1563
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,916
My god!

1564
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:05,750
What games he is playing at
7 years of age!

1565
01:56:07,208 --> 01:56:09,666
That's it! Done!

1566
01:56:11,625 --> 01:56:17,041
Bhutu, my dear, come here…

1567
01:56:20,166 --> 01:56:22,583
So, my dear… they'll no longer
keep you in school...

1568
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:26,500
Now, they'll throw you out completely…

1569
01:56:26,541 --> 01:56:30,125
They'll transfer you and the stuff
your 'talented' son has done…

1570
01:56:30,125 --> 01:56:33,208
No school will ever take him…

1571
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:37,833
What does he think he is?
No… no…

1572
01:56:39,708 --> 01:56:40,875
All because of you… Me?

1573
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:42,250
All of it because of you…
That day you said remember?

1574
01:56:42,291 --> 01:56:45,500
Ma'am it isn't his fault…
All of it is mine…

1575
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:47,708
Whom did you put vermillion on?
What?

1576
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:50,958
No no… tell me… who was it?
Same blood is flowing in both of you.

1577
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Your son is doing what you had done!

1578
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,583
In which class, did you do it?
Class 4, 6, 10 or 12?

1579
01:56:57,666 --> 01:56:59,666
Tell me… tell me…
Why are you stopping me?

1580
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:03,125
He has ruined everything…
What else is left?
He has ruined his future!

1581
01:57:03,125 --> 01:57:06,000
Bhutu… we won't be able to show
our face anymore…

1582
01:57:06,041 --> 01:57:08,041
What are you saying in front of a child!

1583
01:57:08,041 --> 01:57:11,541
You'll have to sit at home now…
Nothing to do…

1584
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:14,375
All my dreams are ruined…

1585
01:57:14,375 --> 01:57:17,708
He has done a mistake…
Don't be like this…

1586
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:23,833
It's spaghetti for you today…

1587
01:57:23,875 --> 01:57:25,875
Eat everything, alright?

1588
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,375
Hi… this is Shyamoli Rakshit…

1589
01:57:36,666 --> 01:57:40,166
My son is the one to catch them again…

1590
01:57:43,375 --> 01:57:44,583
Take the bag…

1591
01:57:44,666 --> 01:57:48,208
Started with a kiss…
now vermillion…

1592
01:57:48,916 --> 01:57:51,791
God knows what else is there to see…

1593
01:57:53,041 --> 01:57:55,583
Sumitra… make him drink his milk…

1594
01:57:55,666 --> 01:58:00,000
No … I won't drink milk…
You have to drink the milk…

1595
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:02,416
Hello…

1596
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:03,708
You know right?

1597
01:58:03,708 --> 01:58:07,750
Tanuruchi and Bodhiswatto…
have gotten married…

1598
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:13,291
I called you to warn you…

1599
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:23,666
Yeah… that whatsapp group…
it'll spread over there…

1600
01:58:23,708 --> 01:58:27,458
After all, it's shameful…

1601
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:29,833
What happened?
Are you fine?

1602
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:31,708
I'll hang up now…

1603
01:58:32,166 --> 01:58:33,875
Bye…

1604
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:47,833
Dirty politics again?
You'll get thrashed again!

1605
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:52,750
Deserved that!

1606
01:58:54,916 --> 01:58:58,000
Now what?
Now what?

1607
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:02,125
Has my daughter learnt this
vermillion thing at home?

1608
01:59:03,083 --> 01:59:06,250
I don't understand…
what is happening in this school?

1609
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:09,208
One after the other, things are
happening with my daughter…

1610
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:11,833
You could lose your license like this…
Do you realize that?

1611
01:59:11,875 --> 01:59:14,541
Do you even know what is happening
in this school?

1612
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:20,500
And I'm telling you, as well…
that was your last warning…

1613
01:59:20,583 --> 01:59:22,500
My daughter was clearly molested…

1614
01:59:22,541 --> 01:59:27,916
You said it's a kiss or a peck, something
kiddish…happened while playing.

1615
01:59:27,916 --> 01:59:29,541
Now, what do you have to say about this?

1616
01:59:29,625 --> 01:59:31,375
This is also kiddish, quite normal?

1617
01:59:31,375 --> 01:59:34,833
My daughter will return with vermillion…
I'll have to accept that?

1618
01:59:34,875 --> 01:59:36,333
Because it happened playfully…

1619
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:38,375
Don't you think it's too much playfulness?

1620
01:59:38,458 --> 01:59:39,750
The girl is to blame…

1621
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:45,916
The girl is to be blamed
for everything, ma'am…

1622
01:59:48,208 --> 01:59:52,666
My son has been here in this school
since nursery…
right?

1623
01:59:52,708 --> 01:59:56,541
Has there ever been any complaint like
this? And it has been co-ed since nursery…

1624
01:59:56,625 --> 01:59:59,625
What are you trying to say? I'm trying
to say that this girl is dangerous…

1625
01:59:59,666 --> 02:00:02,416
She has seduced my son, ma'am…

1626
02:00:02,458 --> 02:00:03,958
What?

1627
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:07,583
What did you say? Seduce?

1628
02:00:07,666 --> 02:00:11,208
What are you even saying?
She is a small girl…a little girl…

1629
02:00:11,208 --> 02:00:14,208
Do you even know what that means?
What language!

1630
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:17,458
You know nothing!

1631
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:21,875
Oho… now they'll teach me
language…hilarious!

1632
02:00:30,083 --> 02:00:31,000
Did you hear that?

1633
02:00:31,041 --> 02:00:35,958
Her daughter is a child…
and my son is a grandfather or what?

1634
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,833
You only tell me, ma'am…
please tell me…

1635
02:00:38,875 --> 02:00:42,791
If my son can "molest"... why can't
her daughter "seduce"?

1636
02:00:42,833 --> 02:00:45,208
You go take care of your daughter…
go… get lost!

1637
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:47,041
Please please… silence…

1638
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:49,416
I don't want to talk to them…Ma'am…
Even we don't want…

1639
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:51,333
Ma'am please tell them…
Neither are we interested in talking…

1640
02:00:51,333 --> 02:00:53,541
Listen to me… You listen…

1641
02:00:53,625 --> 02:00:55,541
We aren't here to talk to you…
Yes, exactly…

1642
02:00:55,583 --> 02:01:00,083
And why are you even talking to them?
Let's just call Mr Dalmia… that's all…

1643
02:01:00,083 --> 02:01:01,916
Who is 'Dalmut'?

1644
02:01:01,958 --> 02:01:05,375
Why aren't you calling?
Yes, I'll do that…

1645
02:01:05,458 --> 02:01:10,625
However… you have a policy…
you don't listen to rumours…

1646
02:01:10,666 --> 02:01:12,916
Because a lot of innocent people's
lives are at stake…

1647
02:01:12,916 --> 02:01:16,291
So we won't take
any action, without proof…

1648
02:01:16,333 --> 02:01:19,791
I'll call Mr Dalmia… only
after I see the CCTV footage…

1649
02:01:19,833 --> 02:01:23,041
Yes… yes… right…
You do have the footage right?

1650
02:01:23,083 --> 02:01:25,291
Even we want to…
watch the CC TV footage…

1651
02:01:25,333 --> 02:01:29,500
Even I want to see whose fault is it…
We'll see…
CC TV footage…

1652
02:01:29,583 --> 02:01:31,416
What nonsense!

1653
02:01:40,541 --> 02:01:46,291
See… see…
he is looking for Chini…
yeah, right…
look at that…

1654
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:56,916
Oh, my God…
my child has no protection…

1655
02:01:56,958 --> 02:02:00,250
Protection?
Is my son an animal that he'll bite?

1656
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:03,625
Protection?

1657
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,583
Pause… pause… pause it…

1658
02:02:09,833 --> 02:02:11,375
Look there…

1659
02:02:12,333 --> 02:02:15,458
The boy has caught hold of
my daughter's hand…is it clear?

1660
02:02:15,541 --> 02:02:18,000
First move is from the boy…
yes, first move…

1661
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,708
Here… right there…
She is signalling to him...
signalling!

1662
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:26,083
Clearly she made a sign.
What sign?

1663
02:02:26,125 --> 02:02:30,625
Why? Don't you know?
How girls give signals to guys…

1664
02:02:30,708 --> 02:02:34,791
Where is…not exactly
a signal…look properly!

1665
02:02:35,916 --> 02:02:37,958
I'm feeling unwell…

1666
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,541
Relax… relax…
You need to calm down…

1667
02:02:41,625 --> 02:02:45,625
Please drink some water…
Ok.. ok, no problem…

1668
02:02:45,625 --> 02:02:48,500
Should we be playing the footage anymore?

1669
02:02:48,541 --> 02:02:54,833
What? Yes… yes… absolutely…
We want to watch the whole thing…

1670
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:56,916
And you please cool down…
don't shout…

1671
02:02:59,166 --> 02:03:00,541
Again?
Again!

1672
02:03:00,625 --> 02:03:03,791
Please pause it…pause… pause…

1673
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:11,500
Please tell me something…
why do you even
have the CCTV surveillance?

1674
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:15,791
A boy… who had kissed my
daughter a few days back…

1675
02:03:15,791 --> 02:03:20,416
He is going to a private space
with my child…
and none of you…

1676
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,958
I mean what on earth were
you doing?
What were you doing?

1677
02:03:22,958 --> 02:03:29,208
One can clearly see here in the CCTV footage…
that the girl is being dragged to a corner…

1678
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:32,333
Why didn't you stop it, right then?
Yeah… right…

1679
02:03:32,375 --> 02:03:35,500
He dragged her…
the girl also started off immediately…

1680
02:03:35,583 --> 02:03:39,000
She is being taken to a corner…
She is going to a corner…

1681
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,125
Yeah right! She is such a sissy!

1682
02:03:41,166 --> 02:03:44,500
She doesn't understand anything! Nothing…

1683
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:48,000
I'm telling you ma'am…
she went willingly…

1684
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,125
She had every intention of
going with my son…

1685
02:03:52,166 --> 02:03:54,375
I'm telling you…
you are overreacting again…

1686
02:03:54,458 --> 02:03:56,708
You shut up!
You tell me…

1687
02:03:56,708 --> 02:04:00,708
Why did the wretched girl have to
join this school? To ruin my son's life?

1688
02:04:00,750 --> 02:04:05,000
No… I don't think…we should be
showing any more footage…

1689
02:04:05,041 --> 02:04:08,125
No… no… no…
Please please… ma'am…

1690
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:11,833
We wish to watch the whole thing…
Please…

1691
02:04:11,875 --> 02:04:16,041
Mr Sen… please don't take the whole matter
so seriously…
It's a childish incident…

1692
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:19,875
Very childish… It's playfulness…

1693
02:04:19,916 --> 02:04:24,291
You are again saying it's childish?
Playfulness?

1694
02:04:24,333 --> 02:04:25,375
Right…

1695
02:04:25,458 --> 02:04:27,541
Was the Ranikuthi incident also playful?

1696
02:04:27,583 --> 02:04:28,583
Right…

1697
02:04:29,250 --> 02:04:32,083
The negligence of these small incidents…
lead to bigger troubles…

1698
02:04:32,125 --> 02:04:34,166
You'll never get it…

1699
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:39,125
I'll show you how to play games…

1700
02:04:39,166 --> 02:04:42,291
You know Ranojoy Sen?
Ranojoy Sen, the journalist?

1701
02:04:42,333 --> 02:04:46,833
He is my brother-in-law…I'm calling him up…
there'll be a press conference here…

1702
02:04:46,875 --> 02:04:49,458
Let them watch the footage
and decide for themselves…

1703
02:04:49,541 --> 02:04:53,416
Yes… that is what we will do
… a press conference…

1704
02:04:53,458 --> 02:04:58,375
This footage will be shown there and
this will create history…
this is historical…

1705
02:04:59,583 --> 02:05:03,583
Yeah… history… geography and other
subjects…
teach whatever you want…

1706
02:05:03,625 --> 02:05:06,541
What will you prove in front of the press?

1707
02:05:06,583 --> 02:05:10,041
Even I'll say that your daughter
seduced my son…

1708
02:05:10,041 --> 02:05:13,458
After watching the footage…I'll prove that
your daughter is the main culprit…

1709
02:05:13,541 --> 02:05:17,250
We don't want to talk to you…
You please manage your wife…

1710
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:19,750
Where is Chini?
Why can't you tell them anything?

1711
02:05:19,791 --> 02:05:21,500
Why are you telling me?

1712
02:05:21,583 --> 02:05:24,500
Bhutu!
You can't handle your son…
trying to handle me…

1713
02:05:24,541 --> 02:05:25,833
Chini… Bhutu!

1714
02:05:27,708 --> 02:05:29,791
Where did she go?
Where will you look for her now?

1715
02:05:31,041 --> 02:05:34,625
Do you know where she is…
Please wait… we're looking…

1716
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:36,500
They were right here…
where can they go?

1717
02:05:39,666 --> 02:05:41,333
Have you seen two kids?

1718
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:43,125
They are there…

1719
02:05:43,166 --> 02:05:44,375
Where?

1720
02:05:44,458 --> 02:05:49,458
They are in the playground…
Chini… Bhutu!

1721
02:05:49,458 --> 02:05:51,458
We've found them… come on…

1722
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:55,125
Come on, let's catch Bodhiswatto…

1723
02:05:59,375 --> 02:06:01,625
Oh God… he fell down…
Wait a minute…
he has fallen…

1724
02:06:01,708 --> 02:06:03,875
Don't react... please…

1725
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:06,541
Just wait and watch for a second…
just be patient…

1726
02:06:09,583 --> 02:06:11,750
Be patient!

1727
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:14,041
My leg is hurting!

1728
02:06:14,083 --> 02:06:16,375
Nothing will happen…

1729
02:06:16,458 --> 02:06:19,291
It'll be okay…don't cry…

1730
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:24,583
Chini… Just wait…

1731
02:06:26,875 --> 02:06:31,958
Don't cry…even I got hurt
while playing…even I fell down…

1732
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:43,875
Wow…

1733
02:06:43,875 --> 02:06:46,000
Actually…

1734
02:06:46,958 --> 02:06:51,791
Their world is very innocent…
like a beautiful flower…

1735
02:06:51,833 --> 02:06:53,875
Very pure…

1736
02:06:53,916 --> 02:06:56,750
Why are you crying like a fool?

1737
02:06:56,791 --> 02:06:59,041
Quiet now…

1738
02:06:59,083 --> 02:07:04,083
Don't judge them as adults…
Look at them through their eyes…

1739
02:07:04,125 --> 02:07:07,041
For them a kiss is a sweet gesture…

1740
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:10,791
Nothing happened…

1741
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:15,875
This is so pure…

1742
02:07:15,916 --> 02:07:19,916
We'll not bother who is to blame…

1743
02:07:19,916 --> 02:07:23,458
We'll let them grow up,
in their own way...

1744
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:27,166
Come on… we'll play again…
now smile a little…

1745
02:07:27,166 --> 02:07:30,291
Come on, get up… let's play...

1746
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:46,250
Quarrel and arguments
Fights and disagreements

1747
02:07:46,250 --> 02:07:49,708
Everything simply washed away

1748
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:53,458
With a few friendly kisses.

1749
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:12,166
Stop warring right now
Give yourself a treat

1750
02:08:12,166 --> 02:08:15,625
Tastier and yummier than that...

1751
02:08:15,708 --> 02:08:19,708
With a few friendly kisses.

1752
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:38,000
A forest full of dreams
With a slight touch of sweetness

1753
02:08:38,041 --> 02:08:41,625
Love like magic unfolds...

1754
02:08:41,708 --> 02:08:45,375
We have planned to
Make friends all around

1755
02:08:45,375 --> 02:08:47,208
Who all agree to this?

1756
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:49,083
Will you take me in your team?

1757
02:08:49,125 --> 02:08:52,000
What?
Will you let me play with you?

1758
02:08:52,875 --> 02:08:54,583
Hey…

1759
02:08:54,666 --> 02:09:01,166
He is no longer an enemy…
he will be in our team… ok?

1760
02:09:03,458 --> 02:09:06,958
Add dollops of friendly kisses...

1761
02:09:11,083 --> 02:09:15,291
Oh, this is great.
Ok!

1762
02:09:15,333 --> 02:09:18,791
Oh… how are you?
Good… and you?

1763
02:09:18,833 --> 02:09:22,541
What personality! Warrior queen!

1764
02:09:22,625 --> 02:09:24,958
But you know…
You should be
involved in active politics…

1765
02:09:24,958 --> 02:09:25,958
What?
Yes...

1766
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,916
Have you ever thought about it?
May I say something?

1767
02:09:29,583 --> 02:09:32,083
Come on, let's join hands
and work together…

1768
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:40,000
Yeah… this one… thank you.

1769
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:43,000
Have you furnished your whole flat?

1770
02:09:43,041 --> 02:09:46,375
A beautiful rocking chair has just arrived…
let me set it up in your balcony…

1771
02:09:46,458 --> 02:09:48,500
Keep rocking then…

1772
02:09:50,083 --> 02:09:51,208
Have some…

1773
02:10:01,166 --> 02:10:02,458
What happened?

1774
02:10:03,375 --> 02:10:04,083
What?

1775
02:10:04,125 --> 02:10:06,750
Don't tell anyone…

1776
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:29,083
Let's hold hands and be friends

1777
02:10:29,083 --> 02:10:32,583
Play fun games like musical chairs...

1778
02:10:32,666 --> 02:10:36,500
Let's share our tiffin...

1779
02:10:36,541 --> 02:10:40,333
And rub our cheeks together.

1780
02:10:41,958 --> 02:10:45,583
Add loads of friendly kisses.

1781
02:10:48,041 --> 02:10:50,500
Listen, I have something to tell you…

1782
02:10:50,583 --> 02:10:52,375
To me?
Yes…

1783
02:10:52,375 --> 02:10:56,375
Listen… We'll now be
in the same class, right?

1784
02:10:56,458 --> 02:10:58,500
You don't have any objection, right?

1785
02:10:59,375 --> 02:11:00,541
No…

1786
02:11:01,458 --> 02:11:03,541
Then, bow down a little…

1787
02:11:09,708 --> 02:11:13,875
Add ninety one, ninety two,
Ninety five, ninety six,

1788
02:11:13,875 --> 02:11:17,041
Ninety nine,
a century of friendly kisses.
