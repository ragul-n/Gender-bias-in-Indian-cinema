1
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:55,962
Good Evening.
I am the Chorus

2
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,264
This...
what are you doing there?

3
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,786
This is my naughty...

4
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,240
- Your actress...
- True, true, actress

5
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:08,240
Dear, our public is waiting
for us to start 'Utsav"

6
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,429
What is it about?

7
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,584
About the Festival of Spring

8
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:17,884
About youth, flowers,
love and colour

9
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:23,089
And the love of
Vasantsena, the courtesan

10
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:24,942
A Courtesan! Ugh!

11
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,361
Do not sneer

12
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,330
We speak an era in which
courtesans were honoured

13
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,719
Not today's India then!

14
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:38,704
No. It was an age when
India was prosperous

15
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:45,311
- India of the 64 arts!
- What are they, sir?

16
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,731
Music, for instance

17
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:51,134
It was a national obsession

18
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:56,221
They lived, died and even
ruined themselves for music

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Like Charudatt, our hero,
the love of Vasantsena...

20
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,750
Rich once, he has
nothing left

21
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,853
Ah, the spell of art!

22
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:13,406
Another art, equally
obsessive, gambling!

23
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:19,847
Watch that man

24
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:21,798
A famous masseur once

25
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,284
He does nothing but gamble

26
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:42,837
Art! That!

27
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:45,371
- No less than stealing
- Stealing?

28
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,930
That is Sajjal, the thief

29
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,449
Unmatched in the art of stealing

30
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,962
What is he doing?

31
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,412
What else can a thief be
doing at night?

32
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,261
He can be doing "this"
at night!

33
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:29,983
There's another art for you.
Love

34
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:32,769
India celebrates the
art of Love

35
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:39,808
"Love" is painted, sung
and glorified in music

36
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:45,814
Vatsyayan is writing a book
on the art of Love

37
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,119
"Kamasutra"

38
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,672
- Can I meet him?
- Yes

39
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,841
When?
- When I dress up

40
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,228
Oh, it's you!

41
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,319
You were telling me about
the arts, sir

42
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,709
The art of politics

43
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,462
An evil king rules the city

44
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,515
People are unhappy

45
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:38,567
Aryak, son of a shepherd,
is planning a revolution

46
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,491
And his companion?
- He has no name

47
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:50,146
True, politicians are
always anonymous

48
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:58,437
Samsthanak
Brother-in-law of the king

49
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,173
He is chasing Vasantsena

50
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:03,493
Will no one help?

51
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:06,162
- People are afraid.
- Won't you help?

52
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:07,664
I am the Chorus

53
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:12,018
I start the show.
I don't interfere

54
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:23,414
Wait!

55
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,996
Where has she gone?
- Patience, sir. Guards!

56
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:46,203
Where did she go?

57
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:48,489
There!

58
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,838
Samsthanak loves you.
He will give you anything

59
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,412
Stop playing a coquette!

60
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:13,673
It is getting late

61
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,160
Haven't you gone yet?

62
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:20,297
Maitrey

63
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:26,635
Are you going or not?
- I refuse to go

64
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:31,106
You know what the streets
are like at night?

65
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:35,627
Full of thieves, pimps...
...assassins, terrorists!

66
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,753
And to take this maid
with me?

67
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:48,223
A poor Brahmin like me,
how can I protect her?

68
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:55,213
My wife needs the maid to
help her with the child

69
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,535
If you don't go, I shall

70
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:18,838
You don't have to go

71
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:22,743
Nor do I

72
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:28,431
It is a job for a servant

73
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:33,752
Four years ago, we had
so many servants

74
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:38,424
Today, not a single
one left!

75
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,978
Are you making up for my
wife's absence?

76
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,432
Go on.
Avoid facing the truth

77
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:48,034
You and your music

78
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,337
Your flute, veena
and drums

79
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,423
Where are your music-Ioving
friends now?

80
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:00,096
Flown away like birds

81
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,832
It is late.
Madam will be waiting

82
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,620
Your father-in-law
retires early

83
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,223
Who will open the door?

84
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,291
Come

85
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,372
This had to go out now

86
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,509
Go on. I'll light it
and come

87
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,659
There she is.
But, sir...

88
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:25,716
Help!

89
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,943
From Aryak, a present to
the King

90
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,316
You and your music!

91
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,590
You and your music!

92
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,929
So it's your turn now

93
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,919
"The evening passes from
the skies..."

94
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:26,101
"...and leaves us with our
Ioneliness"

95
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:32,642
"Birds of rays fly...

96
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,033
...away from our eyes"

97
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:25,227
"Young buds were peeping
from a net of leaves"

98
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:39,158
"Lost in the fragrant humming"

99
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:47,615
"Suddenly the sleepy eyes
are invaded by darkness"

100
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,439
"The buds have no companion
in their tears"

101
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:53,565
"The night comes draped in
a veil of glow-worms..."

102
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,962
"...and whispers the fragrance
of the night flowers"

103
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:23,813
You are still here?

104
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,750
Not gone yet?

105
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,519
Maitrey refused to take you?
He is becoming unsufferable

106
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,642
Alright, I'll escort you

107
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,430
My wife will be furious

108
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:49,054
Bring me that shawl!
Don't just stand there

109
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:51,374
That yellow one

110
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:53,943
Must be there somewhere

111
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:38,138
Who are you?

112
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:03,077
Pardon me for entering your
house without permission

113
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:04,948
I am Vasantsena

114
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,340
I am Charudatt, and you are
beautiful

115
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,098
The King's brother-in-law
was harrasing me

116
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:26,952
I took shelter in your house

117
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:32,106
A beautiful person like
you... alone... in the night

118
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:39,363
Usually, we have nothing to fear
He seems to have gone. I'll go now

119
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:43,152
Alone? I'll come with you

120
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:54,714
May I?

121
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,317
No, no. Wait.
I'll get a lamp

122
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:23,241
No oil. Even lamps don't
burn for pennyless men

123
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:27,295
Like us courtesans?
- No, no. I didn't mean that

124
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,250
Please don't worry.
People respect us

125
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:37,774
I'll go alone

126
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:55,474
Oh... the theives...

127
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:02,797
May I leave my jewellery
here for the night?

128
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:04,901
Here? Certainly

129
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:35,465
Please...

130
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:25,481
I am sorry to trouble you

131
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:30,937
It's all right

132
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,790
I meant my neXt piece of
jewellery. It's complicated

133
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:39,962
Where does one start?

134
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,682
The first hook is here

135
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:48,973
I said the road will be
infested with rascals. You...

136
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:07,693
Yes, the bananas

137
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,260
Perhaps we should lie down?

138
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:28,313
I wish be easier to take off

139
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,696
I wish Vatsyayan was here

140
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:06,701
He is in our house, writing
a treatise on love

141
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:11,274
The Kamasutra

142
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:14,325
You know how many postures
he has discovered?

143
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:17,646
Twenty-eight
- Twenty-eight!

144
00:25:21,635 --> 00:25:23,535
This is going to be the 29th

145
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:10,715
Sir, you are a source of
knowledge for us all

146
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:16,371
Your visit is a
great honour

147
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:23,127
I am not an immodest man,
but you are right

148
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:28,483
What is your house after all?

149
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:32,637
A house of pleasure...
a brothel?

150
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:40,144
In a hundred years, nobody
will remember it

151
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:42,865
Too true. It's all Maya

152
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:47,702
My Kamasutra will make
it immortal

153
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:53,408
It will be remembered as...

154
00:26:56,563 --> 00:26:58,263
...the creative workshop

155
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,833
The laboratory where
I researched

156
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,155
By God's grace!

157
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:11,492
This is why I insist these
girls listen to you

158
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:17,199
To learn your deep
metaphysics

159
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:20,402
Not only metaphysics,
but science!

160
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:25,339
To analyse the reactions
between man and woman

161
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:30,695
To classify and tabulate
the data

162
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:33,399
That is Science!

163
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:08,667
Doesn't your research...

164
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,387
...affect you personally?

165
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,326
A good question

166
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:20,729
For the scientific spirit

167
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,266
What's needed is detachment

168
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:26,518
What's essential is...
Objectivity!

169
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:31,673
That's why I am a bachelor!

170
00:28:34,494 --> 00:28:37,094
Celebrate! Love for me is a
matter of study

171
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,950
What is a "posture"
after all?

172
00:28:43,337 --> 00:28:44,987
Merely a state of mind!

173
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:48,825
Sir

174
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,810
Have you discovered any
new postures?

175
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:57,031
I am afraid not
I am still stuck at 28

176
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:00,635
The 29th continues to
elude me

177
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:05,622
The younger generation worries
me by it's lack of imagination

178
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:10,279
Sir, upstairs

179
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:13,766
Quick, sir, quick.

180
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:16,151
These novices...
so eXcitable!

181
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:32,316
Quick! It takes only
five minutes after all

182
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,109
Beautiful! Take it down!

183
00:30:00,914 --> 00:30:04,014
The man shoves his head in
the crook of woman's elbow

184
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,551
She touches his navel with
her nose and sneezes

185
00:30:11,091 --> 00:30:12,841
He bellows like a bull...

186
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:16,744
...and wraps his legs round
a column(pillar)

187
00:30:17,197 --> 00:30:19,197
Presses his elbow
into her back

188
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:25,087
She cackles like a swan

189
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,243
They fall to the floor
with a thud...

190
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:35,297
...on his left hip and...

191
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:39,167
...stare into each
other's eyes.

192
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,127
We shall call this...
THE COLUMN POSTURE (PILLAR)

193
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,527
I have discovered a
marvellous posture!

194
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:53,047
I must tell Vasantsena.
I have found the 29th!

195
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:56,819
Slaves for sale

196
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:16,305
Don't beat me

197
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:20,625
Give me time to
sell myself

198
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:25,163
Why gamble if you
had no money?

199
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:33,187
A masseur for sale!
I was the palace masseur

200
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,310
He can't even sell himself

201
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,679
Market is dull today

202
00:31:42,516 --> 00:31:43,816
Sell your father

203
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:47,020
- He is dead
- Sell your mother

204
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:49,020
Haven't got one
- Sell yourself

205
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,789
I am trying
Sir, will you buy me?

206
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:58,112
I was the King's masseur
I can revive the dead

207
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:03,619
What's he done?

208
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,720
He is ditching on payment

209
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,125
So he has to sell himself

210
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:25,156
Not deaf, is he?
Behind Vasantsena's house!

211
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,810
Let him go
The money first

212
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,626
Bravo!
- Lower your voice

213
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:05,196
You saved my life,
I am your slave for life

214
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:07,783
I swear

215
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:11,319
You'll follow me?
- Say the word

216
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:15,206
You knew Aryak?
- Who doesn't? Who doesn't?

217
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,692
I am his right-hand man

218
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:23,148
A tyrant rules this city

219
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:30,105
If you say so

220
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,090
It's time for a revolution

221
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:37,397
Day-after-tomorrow is the
Spring Festival

222
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,297
- Everyone will be drunk
- It's only once a year!

223
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:44,601
The whole palace will be
drunk. Sunk in revelry

224
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:47,271
We'll attack them.
It's the best time

225
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:55,479
As a known masseur, you can
easily enter the palace

226
00:33:57,484 --> 00:33:59,084
Enter the palace? Why?

227
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:01,219
As a revolutionary

228
00:34:02,656 --> 00:34:04,006
We count upon you

229
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:05,991
Me? Fight?

230
00:34:11,164 --> 00:34:13,064
Traitor! You can't
escape me!

231
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:16,051
I am a simple masseur

232
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:19,036
I'll massage the whole army
but I can't fight

233
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:24,526
You've heard our whole plan

234
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:26,562
Please, sir

235
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:29,763
Why don't we go in,
instead of loitering here?

236
00:34:31,518 --> 00:34:34,268
Vasantsena and her Mother
are both very greedy

237
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:42,176
Show them these presents.
They'll come to us

238
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:57,926
Help! Help!

239
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:01,345
He is a terrorist!
He is Aryak's man!

240
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:04,199
Wants to enlist me too!

241
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,020
Ha! Ha!
Me a revolutionary?

242
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:12,673
If I fight, who will
do the massaging?

243
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:17,579
We'll massage you

244
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,199
Don't kill him
A dead body fetches no price

245
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:01,522
Wait here.
I'll go to the front gate

246
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:14,386
Who are you?

247
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:24,895
You can't enter here.
Come by the main door

248
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:29,285
Sir

249
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,820
Where is Rishi Vatsyayan?
Quick, quick

250
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:42,247
- Third floor!
- So far up?

251
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:43,424
My book is for the
common people

252
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:48,295
This is eXtraordinary!
Sheer genius!

253
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:54,035
We shall pass over this
in silence

254
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:44,786
Thief! Thief!

255
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:07,759
Mother, you are strange!

256
00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:10,244
That brute chased me
through the streets

257
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,233
I wish he'd caught you

258
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:19,219
You are a courtesan, he the
brother-in-law of the King

259
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:24,775
Your concern is the money
not the man

260
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,249
Who doesn't want to fall
in love?

261
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,538
We all do

262
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:40,174
But it's not for
a courtesan

263
00:39:42,328 --> 00:39:43,078
Love!

264
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:45,997
That too with a
poor Brahmin!

265
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:50,984
Where you were last night,
I know everything

266
00:39:54,173 --> 00:39:56,023
What's his name...
Charudatt

267
00:39:57,777 --> 00:40:00,477
You left your jewellery there!
Why? As gifts?

268
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:05,249
I want it stopped instantly!

269
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:11,306
You there

270
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:15,226
Don't hide them
they are God's gift

271
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:24,034
Don't let her upset you.
She is like that

272
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:27,906
She is right

273
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:31,591
It's silly of me to think
of falling in love

274
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:37,148
But Charudatt is so
innocent so

275
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:41,603
What is it?

276
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:43,789
A thief!

277
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:47,208
No one's come in here

278
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:50,844
Then how come this bed
have five feet?

279
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:17,271
Help
I was a servant of Charudatt!

280
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:20,125
Stop

281
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:28,767
Let him go

282
00:41:30,536 --> 00:41:31,486
Come here

283
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,109
You, guards, go away

284
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:45,133
What do you do?

285
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:47,702
I am a masseur!

286
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:50,437
The owner of a gambling
den is after me...

287
00:41:51,457 --> 00:41:53,407
He will kill me for ten coins

288
00:41:56,796 --> 00:41:57,696
Madanika

289
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:00,882
Don't be afraid. Sit down

290
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:10,325
Tell me about him

291
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:13,393
Him? He is at the door.
He wants to sell me...

292
00:42:17,817 --> 00:42:20,267
Don't worry about him!
You are safe here

293
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:25,574
Safe!

294
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:37,301
Who is the owner
of the gambling den?

295
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:44,659
- I am.
- You?

296
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,261
Don't make eyes at me

297
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:51,397
Tell the masseur, I won't go
till I get my ten coins

298
00:42:55,021 --> 00:42:56,621
Here's fifteen! Now go

299
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,192
Fifteen! What a man!

300
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:04,862
Tell him his credit
is restored

301
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:12,854
Madanika!

302
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:16,806
- The way you creep up on me!
- I want to talk to you

303
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:20,146
Look at your clothes.
The guards wouldn't have let you in

304
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,696
I don't care for them

305
00:43:27,553 --> 00:43:29,603
- See you in your room
- Go away

306
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:33,425
Friend masseur

307
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:37,277
We're waiting to hear about
Charudatt. You're silent

308
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,250
You saved my life

309
00:43:47,406 --> 00:43:49,306
You are like my mother to me

310
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:52,810
I won't lie to you

311
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:56,047
I don't know any Charudatt

312
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,250
I heard his name when
you were quarreling

313
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:05,023
Forgive me

314
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:09,544
Give me leave to go

315
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:11,730
Where?

316
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:14,615
I am renouncing this world!

317
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:22,606
If a man's name can save me...

318
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:27,344
...what can't God's name do?

319
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:34,719
Bravo, Lord!

320
00:44:35,621 --> 00:44:38,421
You showed me the depth
of illusion in a flash!

321
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,291
I renounce this Maya

322
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:46,313
I surrender to the Infinite

323
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:55,806
The magic of Charudatt's name!

324
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:58,959
He surrenders to the
Infinite and I to love!

325
00:45:01,147 --> 00:45:03,147
"The sky turns a
sapphire glow"

326
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:11,739
"Birds of rays perch...

327
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:20,331
...on my eye-lashes"

328
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,430
"The bud was dozing on the
bosom of leaves..."

329
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:47,458
"How was it sleeping?"

330
00:45:48,194 --> 00:45:49,944
"Like this little parrot"

331
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,280
"Did it nod?"

332
00:45:53,866 --> 00:45:55,066
"Did it sway?"

333
00:45:56,402 --> 00:45:59,152
"It was lost in the emerald
glow of its dream"

334
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:01,955
"When it was touched by the
peacock feather"

335
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:14,535
"Where was it touched?"

336
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:20,324
"On the cheeks?"
- "On the hair?"

337
00:46:24,063 --> 00:46:26,213
"It was touched on the
eye-lashes"

338
00:46:29,735 --> 00:46:32,535
"And the magic made the bud
open into a flower"

339
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,057
"True, the birds of rays are...

340
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:42,329
...perched on her lashes"

341
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,540
"Striklets bloomed on the
feet of the Champa"

342
00:47:18,851 --> 00:47:20,601
"The twigs kept the beat"

343
00:47:24,457 --> 00:47:26,757
"The bee sings a song of
seven notes"

344
00:47:35,968 --> 00:47:38,268
"Who is in a state to
keep the beat?"

345
00:47:41,474 --> 00:47:43,224
"The birds of rays are...

346
00:47:46,812 --> 00:47:48,762
...perched on our eye-lashes"

347
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:17,952
I am Sajjal

348
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:29,729
- I have been waiting.
- How did you get in?

349
00:49:30,082 --> 00:49:31,782
The art of Guru Mooldev!

350
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:34,986
Run. The guards!

351
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:39,706
They'll catch you
- They, don't worry me

352
00:49:49,768 --> 00:49:51,318
I want to talk to you

353
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:54,171
- Where?
- The Drama Workshop

354
00:49:58,777 --> 00:50:00,077
Run! The guards!

355
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:04,547
It'll take 50 counts to
break down the door

356
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,051
I need 10 to go away.
So we've 40

357
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,340
Count!
- One-two-three-four-five

358
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:22,934
Forty!

359
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:34,779
Water!

360
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,800
Thief! Thief!

361
00:50:39,985 --> 00:50:42,485
Another one?
- Look! He escaped that way!

362
00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:53,896
The same mess here as well
I go away for two days

363
00:50:57,169 --> 00:50:59,519
And the whole house turns
topsy-turvey

364
00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:04,691
Couldn't some one have
picked this up?

365
00:51:17,022 --> 00:51:18,372
Give me the shawl

366
00:51:20,526 --> 00:51:23,276
- I told Maitrey to tidy up.
- And he told you

367
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:29,048
Talk! Talk! Talk!
That's all you men are good at

368
00:51:52,057 --> 00:51:53,357
What is in that?

369
00:52:05,237 --> 00:52:06,887
What is in this bundle?

370
00:52:15,414 --> 00:52:17,864
Some of your father's rubbish,
I am sure

371
00:52:27,593 --> 00:52:29,443
Rohit! Come! The musicians!

372
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:47,962
Charudatt, come here!

373
00:52:51,784 --> 00:52:53,784
- Keep it. My wife...
- Not me!

374
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:58,454
Sit on it, sleep on it.
Just keep it safe

375
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,430
Sajjal

376
00:53:18,143 --> 00:53:20,143
Puppet. Do you approve of her?

377
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:24,731
Careful! He is my friend
and guide

378
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:29,002
I'm sick of your tomfoolery

379
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:31,872
I've no time to waste

380
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:35,342
What do you want?

381
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:37,061
Marry me

382
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:44,952
- Impossible.
- Why?

383
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:47,388
Why he asks

384
00:53:49,842 --> 00:53:51,342
Because I am a slave

385
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,760
As a baby, I was bought
by Vasantsena's mother

386
00:54:03,188 --> 00:54:05,138
Don't worry.
I'll buy you back

387
00:54:07,025 --> 00:54:09,225
You, a pennyless thief
buy me back?

388
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,001
We have our own principles

389
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:21,587
My Guru says, steal for
a living, not for indulgence

390
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,610
I am an indulgence

391
00:54:27,646 --> 00:54:29,496
Go and find someone cheaper

392
00:54:32,217 --> 00:54:33,767
And satisfy your Guru

393
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:38,704
Sajjal never fails. Just
say "yes"...then you'll see

394
00:54:40,993 --> 00:54:42,793
I'll buy you back tomorrow

395
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,980
- Tomorrow? How?
- Somehow

396
00:54:51,403 --> 00:54:53,953
If you fail me... I'll never
see you again

397
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:56,991
I swear by Guru

398
00:55:03,415 --> 00:55:04,965
I am a silly woman...

399
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:12,122
You're too young he says

400
00:55:17,029 --> 00:55:19,929
It's Vatsyayana's disciple.
If he sees me here...

401
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:21,965
...he'll tell everyone

402
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:24,751
He takes all the credit

403
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,240
Only Vatsyayana is capable

404
00:55:33,111 --> 00:55:35,561
I spy, I take notes
I describe the poses

405
00:55:38,116 --> 00:55:41,266
He says, I can watch but I
cannot understand Kamasutra

406
00:55:44,289 --> 00:55:46,839
Let us see what is so
profound in the book

407
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:02,089
Four legs

408
00:56:14,653 --> 00:56:16,603
It's obscene.
It's distracting

409
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:21,408
I had better set it right

410
00:56:46,518 --> 00:56:48,018
I thought I saw four

411
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:09,088
Forgive me, Master, for
doubting your word

412
00:57:13,045 --> 00:57:15,345
I shouldn't have doubted
your Science

413
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,350
Forgive me. I'll never
question you

414
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,409
- Gone! Shall we go out?
- Am I heavy?

415
00:57:31,563 --> 00:57:33,763
- You are light as a flower
- Then?

416
00:57:37,569 --> 00:57:39,469
- What is it?
- You tickle me

417
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:25,048
Aren't you asleep yet?

418
00:58:29,788 --> 00:58:30,488
Come

419
00:58:55,981 --> 00:58:57,531
Did you go mad today?

420
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:02,019
Why?

421
00:59:05,824 --> 00:59:07,324
I am aching all over

422
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,446
No. When the public
collects here tomorrow

423
00:59:27,479 --> 00:59:29,346
They must admire his
artistry

424
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:02,162
That's it. Perfect!

425
01:00:05,383 --> 01:00:06,733
Good-luck, friend

426
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:24,235
All clear?

427
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:24,461
Is that you Charudatt?

428
01:01:25,463 --> 01:01:26,713
Take the jewels

429
01:01:31,803 --> 01:01:33,753
I can't sleep because of them

430
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,480
Oof! Now I can relaX

431
01:01:51,823 --> 01:01:53,273
Maitrey, who is it?

432
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:04,167
- What is it, Aditi?
- A thief!

433
01:02:10,842 --> 01:02:12,992
- Thief? In our house?
- I saw him

434
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:19,933
Why do you giggle, idiot?

435
01:02:20,852 --> 01:02:23,652
She is right. Even our
front door doesn't latch

436
01:02:48,546 --> 01:02:50,896
Aren't you glad if I
gave them to you?

437
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:56,002
What are you talking about?

438
01:02:57,055 --> 01:02:58,605
When you came here...

439
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:00,991
But I didn't

440
01:03:03,561 --> 01:03:04,511
- No?
- No

441
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,150
Then the thief took them!

442
01:03:12,904 --> 01:03:13,904
Took what?

443
01:03:16,408 --> 01:03:17,858
Vasantsena's jewels

444
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,210
What? The thief?

445
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:27,917
How can I face Vasantsena now?

446
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:36,793
You men are all the same

447
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:41,381
Always slobbering after women

448
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:44,366
But I only offered her
shelter in our house

449
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:51,906
And what else? She took off
her jewels just after shelter

450
01:03:55,947 --> 01:03:57,797
Don't give me those eXcuses

451
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,850
What a nice time
for shelter!

452
01:04:03,288 --> 01:04:05,790
I go to Father's house and
she gets shelter here!

453
01:04:05,823 --> 01:04:07,290
You are being unfair

454
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,560
Yes, I'm stupid. Not clever
like that woman

455
01:04:13,131 --> 01:04:14,681
Radha, are you ready?

456
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,550
You are not leaving
at this time of the night?

457
01:04:34,819 --> 01:04:36,219
I'll come with you

458
01:04:36,821 --> 01:04:39,321
Why, are you afraid
I may change my mind?

459
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:42,475
You wait for her here

460
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:47,013
I'll take Maitrey with me

461
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:49,449
Unless he too wants
to see her

462
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:52,786
No, no, I am coming

463
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:03,797
Take this

464
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,150
Please

465
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:13,805
It is the last piece left
from what Father gave me

466
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:18,411
Give it to Vasantsena

467
01:05:19,864 --> 01:05:21,314
Ask her forgiveness

468
01:05:24,536 --> 01:05:26,136
Say no one is to blame

469
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:12,765
Shy of soldiers,
aren't you?

470
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:14,718
Aryak!

471
01:08:52,577 --> 01:08:55,277
I should get two Madanikas
for this much gold

472
01:09:01,419 --> 01:09:03,869
Where did you find it?
- Oh well! Uhm...

473
01:09:05,256 --> 01:09:06,106
Tell me

474
01:09:07,258 --> 01:09:09,308
A brahmin... called
Charudatt...

475
01:09:11,763 --> 01:09:13,563
I hope you didn't kill him

476
01:09:31,115 --> 01:09:34,215
Do you take me for a killer?
I didn't even touch him?

477
01:09:43,795 --> 01:09:46,095
So you have found
another boy-friend!

478
01:09:48,466 --> 01:09:51,416
- I wish I had strangled him
- Sit down, you silly

479
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:01,210
You tickle me
- Where don't you tickle?

480
01:10:03,314 --> 01:10:04,164
Tell me

481
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:07,516
This jewellery was given
to him by Vasantsena

482
01:10:09,654 --> 01:10:12,354
- She loves Charudatt
- We are finished then!

483
01:10:14,659 --> 01:10:15,859
What do we do?

484
01:10:24,168 --> 01:10:27,218
Say that you, his servant
is been sent with the gold

485
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:31,573
But our marriage?
All my efforts wasted

486
01:10:32,009 --> 01:10:33,159
Just our luck

487
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:45,237
So you are Charudatt's servant?

488
01:10:48,526 --> 01:10:49,876
And he sent this?

489
01:10:53,364 --> 01:10:56,164
Suddenly, we seem to meet
his entire household!

490
01:10:58,035 --> 01:11:00,885
Yesterday, it was his
masseur. Today his servant

491
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:07,743
Don't you have any work?

492
01:11:10,548 --> 01:11:11,498
Thank you

493
01:11:17,388 --> 01:11:19,988
Give my thanks to Charudatt
for his concern

494
01:11:21,893 --> 01:11:24,743
The town is crawling with
thieves and tricksters

495
01:11:25,897 --> 01:11:27,047
Can I go now?

496
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,100
Wait

497
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:40,276
I had promised Charudatt

498
01:11:40,745 --> 01:11:43,845
I would give a present to
anyone who brings my jewels

499
01:11:52,256 --> 01:11:53,956
How is my present to you

500
01:11:57,762 --> 01:12:00,512
She was my maid, she
will be your life-partner

501
01:12:09,607 --> 01:12:10,807
Don't tease me

502
01:12:16,781 --> 01:12:18,481
Silly girl, go, be happy

503
01:12:24,288 --> 01:12:25,488
How I envy you

504
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:28,651
- Are you Sajjal?
- Perhaps

505
01:13:30,354 --> 01:13:31,304
Follow me

506
01:13:36,694 --> 01:13:39,594
The King's dogs have just
caught Aryak, our chief

507
01:13:43,367 --> 01:13:45,517
You are the best thief
in the city

508
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:47,770
No wall, no lock can
stop you

509
01:13:51,876 --> 01:13:53,576
You know the prison well

510
01:13:55,546 --> 01:13:57,446
You must free Aryak,
tonight!

511
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:01,301
Sorry, friend

512
01:14:04,388 --> 01:14:05,888
Please, put it away!

513
01:14:08,893 --> 01:14:11,693
This is my beloved, we
are about to get married

514
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:15,548
See you in a fortnight!

515
01:14:26,844 --> 01:14:28,594
Are you looking for this?

516
01:14:29,747 --> 01:14:32,247
Yes, I am the best,
but after a fortnight

517
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,820
How sad!

518
01:14:38,756 --> 01:14:40,106
Had you agreed...

519
01:14:42,593 --> 01:14:45,293
...you and your Guru would
have become famous

520
01:14:51,135 --> 01:14:54,035
You'd be called a political
magician, not a thief

521
01:14:55,606 --> 01:14:57,006
A committed artist

522
01:14:58,609 --> 01:15:01,009
Now the honour will go
to somebody else

523
01:15:06,283 --> 01:15:08,183
- Sure?
- History beckons you

524
01:15:21,966 --> 01:15:22,866
Let's go

525
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:27,535
Have you no eyes, idiot?
You men are all the same

526
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:39,915
I am Maitrey, friend
of Charudatt

527
01:15:41,485 --> 01:15:43,335
Another one from his house!

528
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:57,866
Go inside!
Don't you have any work?

529
01:16:03,674 --> 01:16:04,974
Please, continue

530
01:16:06,677 --> 01:16:09,727
You didn't know my friend
well... He is a gambler...

531
01:16:11,015 --> 01:16:13,165
He has gambled away
your jewellery

532
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:23,775
So this necklace has been
sent as compensation

533
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:25,912
By his wife

534
01:16:27,698 --> 01:16:28,998
- His wife?
- Yes

535
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,580
It's the last piece left
from her inheritance

536
01:16:47,885 --> 01:16:49,485
She gave this and left

537
01:16:52,223 --> 01:16:54,823
- Left? For where?
- For her father's house

538
01:16:58,229 --> 01:17:00,179
So she won't be home tonight?

539
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:04,149
No, knowing her temper...

540
01:17:07,238 --> 01:17:09,338
...she won't be
back for sometime

541
01:17:14,578 --> 01:17:15,528
Thank you

542
01:17:16,613 --> 01:17:18,363
Good evening, sir Gambler

543
01:17:31,595 --> 01:17:32,645
Listen, sir

544
01:17:34,932 --> 01:17:36,932
Tell him to wait for
me tonight

545
01:17:42,106 --> 01:17:44,056
You will tell him, won't you?

546
01:17:59,123 --> 01:18:01,673
How will she come in such rain,
I ask you!

547
01:18:24,315 --> 01:18:26,815
Maitrey, how long do we
wait in the rain?

548
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:31,187
Come

549
01:18:49,006 --> 01:18:50,456
Shall we go in too?

550
01:18:52,676 --> 01:18:54,626
But first, there is a problem

551
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,400
What is the value of
your wife's necklace?

552
01:19:05,856 --> 01:19:07,256
I don't know. Why?

553
01:19:11,862 --> 01:19:13,462
I have gambled it away

554
01:19:15,132 --> 01:19:16,882
Will this do in eXchange?

555
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:42,191
It's the same...

556
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:46,279
Will it do?

557
01:19:58,075 --> 01:20:01,375
This jewellery is difficult
to take off, and this rain...

558
01:20:02,746 --> 01:20:03,796
Not tonight

559
01:20:19,096 --> 01:20:21,546
The other hooks are only
for the thieves

560
01:20:34,278 --> 01:20:35,928
I'll tear her to pieces

561
01:20:36,613 --> 01:20:38,463
Throw her bones to the dogs

562
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:45,019
She dare defy me?
The brother-in-law of the King?

563
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:49,742
I'll twist her neck

564
01:20:53,297 --> 01:20:56,047
- Your highness, careful.
- Let me handle this

565
01:20:57,968 --> 01:20:59,068
Give it here

566
01:21:02,973 --> 01:21:05,373
You have hurt yourself.
You're bleeding

567
01:21:15,652 --> 01:21:17,902
You don't realise how
strong you are

568
01:21:23,827 --> 01:21:25,327
You are like a child

569
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:29,931
Chasing a woman won't
help to win her heart

570
01:21:33,337 --> 01:21:36,037
She drives me to it.
She mocks me, needles me

571
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:42,561
- What do I lack?
- Listen to me

572
01:21:45,282 --> 01:21:46,432
I'll whip her

573
01:21:48,852 --> 01:21:51,852
If you listen to me,
she will bare her back herself

574
01:21:56,527 --> 01:21:58,527
Send a covered chariot
tomorrow

575
01:21:59,863 --> 01:22:01,813
Wait for her in
Pushkara woods

576
01:22:04,034 --> 01:22:07,084
It's the Spring Festival
tomorrow. But I'll send her

577
01:22:13,877 --> 01:22:15,127
- Promise?
- Yes

578
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,480
One can't win a woman
by raving and ranting

579
01:22:21,885 --> 01:22:23,485
And look at your dress

580
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:29,841
Patience. That's the secret

581
01:25:36,847 --> 01:25:38,982
Hurry up! There's a
Revolution at stake

582
01:25:39,015 --> 01:25:39,932
Patience!

583
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:50,140
When the guards see this
they must appreciate my art

584
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,860
We have to free Aryak,
and you talk of art!

585
01:25:55,599 --> 01:25:57,934
Is there no place for
art in Revolution?

586
01:25:57,967 --> 01:25:58,534
No

587
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:03,253
The kind of people one has
to associate with for fame!

588
01:26:58,161 --> 01:27:00,611
Aryak, run away.
We'll handle the guards

589
01:27:32,529 --> 01:27:35,029
- What's that?
- It's the Spring Festival

590
01:27:35,632 --> 01:27:37,032
Don't you like it?

591
01:27:38,635 --> 01:27:39,585
Not today

592
01:27:42,038 --> 01:27:44,388
I want to spend the day
alone with you

593
01:27:50,881 --> 01:27:52,081
Some other day

594
01:27:57,554 --> 01:28:00,054
No, today. Let's go to the
Pushkara woods

595
01:28:02,726 --> 01:28:05,626
Everyone will be in the city.
No one in the woods

596
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,700
Poor fellow! This is the
festival of courtesans

597
01:28:13,236 --> 01:28:15,886
They won't let me go out
through the streets

598
01:28:16,072 --> 01:28:17,422
Everyone knows me

599
01:28:20,243 --> 01:28:22,643
I'll send you a covered cart.
Get ready

600
01:28:26,683 --> 01:28:28,683
A cart will be eXpensive today

601
01:28:31,254 --> 01:28:33,254
I'll give him this...
something

602
01:28:46,937 --> 01:28:48,937
Take this...
only for the cart!

603
01:28:55,445 --> 01:28:56,995
Don't gamble it away!

604
01:29:14,464 --> 01:29:17,014
- Are you Charudatt's maid?
- No, his wife

605
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:25,656
I have some sandal paste
for your bath

606
01:29:28,144 --> 01:29:30,944
There's nothing else in the
house worthy of you

607
01:29:36,152 --> 01:29:37,952
You are not angry with me?

608
01:29:43,994 --> 01:29:46,694
I thought you had gone to
your father's house

609
01:29:47,831 --> 01:29:49,681
I had gone... but came back

610
01:29:51,835 --> 01:29:54,885
This was my one chance to
meet the famous Vasantsena

611
01:29:59,509 --> 01:30:01,859
Once I was away, I knew
you would come

612
01:30:40,216 --> 01:30:42,266
"Why does the heart tremble..."

613
01:30:51,561 --> 01:30:53,661
"...in the middle of the night?"

614
01:30:54,564 --> 01:30:56,614
"Because the 'Bela' bloomed..."

615
01:31:01,404 --> 01:31:03,454
"...in the middle of the night"

616
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,720
"Who played the flute
in the middle of the night"

617
01:31:28,932 --> 01:31:30,832
"He who stole the moments...

618
01:31:35,605 --> 01:31:37,605
...in the middle of the night"

619
01:31:47,617 --> 01:31:49,867
- Mother!
- What do you want, Rohit?

620
01:31:53,957 --> 01:31:54,907
Come here

621
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:02,230
Can I go out and play?

622
01:32:04,134 --> 01:32:06,234
Yes. Here, here's a cart for you

623
01:32:13,476 --> 01:32:15,526
I made it for you
Isn't it nice?

624
01:32:18,314 --> 01:32:19,364
Rohit, come

625
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:24,319
You know who that it

626
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,890
- That too is your Mother.
- My Mother?

627
01:32:34,664 --> 01:32:37,114
Then how come she wears
so much of gold?

628
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:39,851
You talk too much

629
01:32:44,674 --> 01:32:47,374
Sorry, but he has never
seen me wear any gold

630
01:32:52,515 --> 01:32:55,215
Never? Then why not put
these on? For a while

631
01:33:00,857 --> 01:33:02,957
- Come, change
- Not here. Inside

632
01:33:26,216 --> 01:33:27,866
No, no, it is yours now

633
01:33:28,218 --> 01:33:30,418
No, it's yours...
will remain yours

634
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,006
It's pretty
Don't part with it

635
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,700
"The jewellery glistens...

636
01:33:49,906 --> 01:33:51,906
...In the middle of the night"

637
01:33:57,747 --> 01:33:59,347
"Guard it with care...

638
01:34:04,087 --> 01:34:06,087
...In the middle of the night"

639
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,410
"Oh, how I blush
in the middle of the night"

640
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:27,640
"May your marriage be safe.
In the middle of the night"

641
01:34:44,127 --> 01:34:47,227
Rohit! I don't want him
to see me like this. Help me!

642
01:35:01,477 --> 01:35:02,877
What is it, Rohit?

643
01:35:09,485 --> 01:35:11,835
The other children won't
play with him

644
01:35:12,322 --> 01:35:15,322
Because his is a clay cart.
They have carts of gold

645
01:35:19,829 --> 01:35:23,079
Don't cry. I'll tell Father.
He will get you a gold cart

646
01:35:26,836 --> 01:35:28,386
What is Mother doing?

647
01:35:30,673 --> 01:35:32,773
Changing. Don't cry,
I'll be back

648
01:36:08,378 --> 01:36:10,878
There is your cart of gold
Isn't it nice?

649
01:36:12,215 --> 01:36:13,065
Go play

650
01:36:17,887 --> 01:36:19,837
Aren't I like your
Mother now?

651
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:30,480
"Why does the heart tremble
in the middle of the night?"

652
01:36:33,102 --> 01:36:36,302
"Because the 'Bela' bloomed
in the middle of the night"

653
01:37:04,434 --> 01:37:06,134
Can I ask you something?

654
01:37:07,937 --> 01:37:09,637
Why don't you resent me?

655
01:37:15,945 --> 01:37:17,695
There are several reasons

656
01:37:21,617 --> 01:37:24,067
Firstly, rich men should
have courtesans

657
01:37:29,792 --> 01:37:32,192
A courtesan like you
makes me feel rich

658
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,800
What else?

659
01:37:41,137 --> 01:37:41,987
Nothing

660
01:37:53,983 --> 01:37:54,833
Tell me

661
01:37:58,821 --> 01:38:00,871
We have been married
seven years

662
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:04,458
He was... alright...
nothing eXciting

663
01:38:08,164 --> 01:38:10,014
It was getting quite boring

664
01:38:16,506 --> 01:38:19,006
But after he spent that
night with you...

665
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,429
...he was... like... like

666
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,820
Like that! Boom!

667
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:55,560
Any other reason?

668
01:38:56,045 --> 01:38:59,095
You're much older. If you
were young, I'd be jealous

669
01:39:19,902 --> 01:39:22,802
Are you the cartman of the
King's brother-in-law?

670
01:39:23,906 --> 01:39:24,906
Yes. I am!

671
01:39:28,177 --> 01:39:29,377
Madam regrets.

672
01:39:32,415 --> 01:39:34,765
Vasantsena didn't come
home last night

673
01:39:37,253 --> 01:39:39,053
That devil will eat me up!

674
01:40:06,782 --> 01:40:08,582
Is this Charudatt's house?

675
01:40:10,119 --> 01:40:12,819
Tell Vasantsena he has
sent this cart for her

676
01:41:04,774 --> 01:41:07,574
Out of the way, you
rascals! I am late already!

677
01:41:32,201 --> 01:41:35,251
I'm ready, Madam Vasantsena
I'll turn the cart round

678
01:41:49,885 --> 01:41:51,435
Good, Madam. Let's go

679
01:42:25,755 --> 01:42:27,305
- Anybody inside?
- No

680
01:42:27,757 --> 01:42:29,107
- Seen Aryak.
- No

681
01:42:32,762 --> 01:42:34,412
I must inspect the cart

682
01:42:45,274 --> 01:42:47,024
You are right. It's empty

683
01:43:19,141 --> 01:43:20,541
Quick! The mirror!

684
01:43:25,147 --> 01:43:26,547
It is not straight

685
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:29,400
Come here. You!

686
01:43:38,928 --> 01:43:40,578
- All right?
- Very nice

687
01:43:42,164 --> 01:43:44,914
She is coming... Those
idiots don't understand

688
01:43:46,502 --> 01:43:49,352
She'll come, I'm sure. I've
got myself an amulet

689
01:43:53,609 --> 01:43:54,859
It is very late

690
01:43:56,011 --> 01:43:58,111
I am sure the old
cartman is slow

691
01:44:01,684 --> 01:44:02,634
Keep calm

692
01:44:05,354 --> 01:44:06,954
I know, I am eXcitable

693
01:44:13,362 --> 01:44:16,262
So I got the court poet to
write lines of welcome

694
01:44:22,538 --> 01:44:24,038
Come
Come, Vasantsena

695
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,410
Light of my life

696
01:44:33,215 --> 01:44:34,065
Stop it

697
01:44:36,051 --> 01:44:37,451
Stop it, you idiot

698
01:44:37,887 --> 01:44:40,587
You are to start when
you see her cart arrive

699
01:44:43,959 --> 01:44:44,759
Listen

700
01:44:48,731 --> 01:44:49,431
Come

701
01:45:00,242 --> 01:45:01,492
Bunch of morons

702
01:45:05,581 --> 01:45:08,381
Why are you nodding your
head like a chameleon?

703
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,670
She is here! She is here!

704
01:45:32,775 --> 01:45:34,675
- Control yourself
- Yes, yes

705
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:39,548
Come, Vasantsena

706
01:45:39,581 --> 01:45:41,748
I'm sorry, Sir. But she
hasn't come

707
01:45:47,623 --> 01:45:49,023
She wasn't at home

708
01:45:55,297 --> 01:45:57,147
She didn't return all night

709
01:46:02,738 --> 01:46:05,938
You should've searched the
whole city, you old vulture!

710
01:46:43,512 --> 01:46:46,612
God, I came here in search
of Peace. But where is it?

711
01:46:50,352 --> 01:46:52,202
Not here. I'll go elsewhere

712
01:47:16,211 --> 01:47:17,411
You have come!

713
01:47:24,386 --> 01:47:26,086
You were only teasing me

714
01:47:27,556 --> 01:47:30,556
What an old fool I am!
I should've known you'd come

715
01:47:41,737 --> 01:47:43,187
Why are you so shy?

716
01:47:47,409 --> 01:47:50,159
We are alone. You know I
chased everybody away

717
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:03,490
Charudatt?
- Who's Charudatt?

718
01:48:16,939 --> 01:48:19,539
You came not for me,
but for somebody else?

719
01:48:21,443 --> 01:48:24,393
I send my cart, I wait.
You come for someone else!

720
01:48:27,116 --> 01:48:29,766
I won't let you go!
I'll tear you to pieces!

721
01:49:28,677 --> 01:49:30,277
Say you've come for me

722
01:49:37,853 --> 01:49:38,653
Say it

723
01:49:51,033 --> 01:49:52,283
Say it! Say it!

724
01:51:26,461 --> 01:51:27,111
Sir

725
01:51:32,968 --> 01:51:34,368
What's the matter?

726
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,490
Can I be of help?

727
01:51:40,976 --> 01:51:42,626
Go away. Leave me alone

728
01:51:52,154 --> 01:51:53,454
Did you call me?

729
01:51:55,324 --> 01:51:56,524
I am Charudatt

730
01:52:13,008 --> 01:52:14,108
So it is you

731
01:52:17,846 --> 01:52:19,396
It's for you she came

732
01:52:20,849 --> 01:52:22,499
She died because of you

733
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,320
You killed her

734
01:52:32,694 --> 01:52:34,394
Murderer!
You killed her!

735
01:52:38,367 --> 01:52:40,617
Arrest him.
He has killed Vasantsena

736
01:52:42,704 --> 01:52:44,604
Vasantsena hasn't
arrived yet

737
01:52:47,709 --> 01:52:49,109
But she went by...

738
01:52:51,546 --> 01:52:53,246
...in a cart a while ago

739
01:52:55,884 --> 01:52:57,084
There! He lies

740
01:52:59,888 --> 01:53:01,588
Go and look. She is dead

741
01:53:06,561 --> 01:53:07,861
I want witnesses

742
01:53:09,731 --> 01:53:12,781
We are posted here to look
for Aryak. We can't leave

743
01:53:13,835 --> 01:53:15,635
Damn Aryak. I order you...

744
01:53:21,743 --> 01:53:23,693
I am the King's
brother-in-law

745
01:53:39,761 --> 01:53:40,761
Poor thing

746
01:53:43,098 --> 01:53:44,798
And no jewellery on her?

747
01:53:45,867 --> 01:53:47,317
She has been robbed

748
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:54,640
That's right. He killed her
for the jewellery

749
01:53:57,112 --> 01:53:58,912
Come, you are my witnesses

750
01:53:58,947 --> 01:54:01,447
There's a shorter route
through the woods

751
01:54:04,953 --> 01:54:07,603
Good. The earlier we finish
this, the better

752
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:23,820
Charudatt looks so innocent

753
01:54:24,806 --> 01:54:27,056
Vasantsena was taken in
by his looks

754
01:54:33,148 --> 01:54:34,483
Where are the jewels?

755
01:54:34,516 --> 01:54:36,651
He must have smuggled them
out with the cartman

756
01:54:36,684 --> 01:54:38,253
But today is the Festival...

757
01:54:38,286 --> 01:54:41,003
Festival or not, I'll see
he is eXecuted today

758
01:54:45,994 --> 01:54:47,544
No Peace here either!

759
01:54:56,838 --> 01:55:00,038
What was the madman saying!
Charudatt killed Vasantsena

760
01:55:03,512 --> 01:55:04,862
Is that possible?

761
01:55:06,848 --> 01:55:09,498
No. The illusory world
is answering me again

762
01:55:13,855 --> 01:55:16,605
I reject this "Maya".
I'll go far and meditate

763
01:55:28,203 --> 01:55:31,153
Madam, we are late. He is
probably wandering about

764
01:55:33,375 --> 01:55:35,325
Please wait.
I'll look for him

765
01:56:13,748 --> 01:56:15,398
Who are you?
Stop! Stop!

766
01:56:26,428 --> 01:56:28,628
Where are you taking my
cart? Stop!

767
01:56:33,935 --> 01:56:36,985
I've had enough. I'll leave
this country and go away

768
01:57:21,149 --> 01:57:23,249
"My mind plays out like
the drum"

769
01:57:23,818 --> 01:57:25,818
"My body vibrates like
cymbals"

770
01:57:26,421 --> 01:57:28,621
"A strange ecstasy fills
the world"

771
01:57:29,157 --> 01:57:31,807
"For Eros has brought
colours of the Spring"

772
01:57:55,016 --> 01:57:56,116
She is alive

773
01:57:57,686 --> 01:57:59,436
"Maya" ensnares me again.

774
01:58:02,023 --> 01:58:03,423
I shall not resist

775
01:58:07,696 --> 01:58:10,096
God, I don't know if I am
a good hermit

776
01:58:13,868 --> 01:58:16,768
There must be some reason
why I am a good masseur

777
01:59:14,262 --> 01:59:16,912
"Oh fair maid, where are
you stealing away?"

778
01:59:24,773 --> 01:59:26,973
"What do you hide under
your veil?"

779
01:59:30,278 --> 01:59:31,778
"Yonder is green..."

780
01:59:41,122 --> 01:59:42,922
"How can I hide my youth?"

781
01:59:46,461 --> 01:59:48,461
"We shall catch you,
fair maid"

782
01:59:51,633 --> 01:59:53,933
"Hand over to us what you
are hiding"

783
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:00,790
Hear ye! The King
declares that...

784
02:00:06,314 --> 02:00:09,014
...Charudatt is condemned
to death for murder

785
02:00:12,821 --> 02:00:15,921
Brother, killing a man even
as punishment is not easy

786
02:00:28,503 --> 02:00:30,303
Vasantsena! Come and dance

787
02:01:04,539 --> 02:01:07,739
We're late. Streets are all
blocked by drunken revelers

788
02:01:11,379 --> 02:01:13,779
- We must attack the palace.
- But how?

789
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:18,250
I know a secret route
to the palace

790
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:19,919
Take about a dozen men

791
02:01:20,388 --> 02:01:23,038
Let the rest try their
luck with the streets

792
02:01:38,406 --> 02:01:40,806
- Good-bye
- Aren't you coming with us?

793
02:01:41,242 --> 02:01:44,242
No. Whoever the King, his
soldiers will be after me

794
02:01:45,413 --> 02:01:48,463
Hope the soldiers pursuing
me tomorrow will be yours

795
02:03:51,039 --> 02:03:53,289
Charudatt, make your final
statement

796
02:03:55,543 --> 02:03:57,843
Hurry up
- It's the Law, sir. Proceed

797
02:04:03,217 --> 02:04:05,467
I have made many mistakes
in my life

798
02:04:06,054 --> 02:04:08,454
But I have never wished
anyone any harm

799
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:13,342
I didn't kill her.
I loved her

800
02:04:15,730 --> 02:04:18,430
I must be paying for the
sins of my past life

801
02:04:20,401 --> 02:04:21,701
I accept my fate

802
02:04:36,584 --> 02:04:38,084
After you
- You first

803
02:04:38,686 --> 02:04:40,586
- No, it's your turn
- Your's

804
02:04:41,422 --> 02:04:43,472
- I did it last time
- Go, check

805
02:04:49,263 --> 02:04:50,463
Get on with it

806
02:04:51,432 --> 02:04:52,932
You are right. Pity!

807
02:05:01,943 --> 02:05:02,693
Stop!

808
02:05:13,955 --> 02:05:15,355
What is happening?

809
02:05:15,556 --> 02:05:17,556
Don't cry, Aditi.
It is my fate

810
02:05:22,463 --> 02:05:24,313
Mercy, sir.
He is not guilty

811
02:05:26,467 --> 02:05:28,667
She left her jewellery
at our house

812
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:35,290
You like this? This is why
I've been saying hurry up

813
02:05:37,912 --> 02:05:40,312
It's my fault. I accepted
the jewellery

814
02:05:44,986 --> 02:05:47,536
He didn't kill her
- He did, he killed her

815
02:05:49,490 --> 02:05:50,890
I'll not spare him

816
02:05:54,328 --> 02:05:57,178
Why humiliate ourselves.
Let me die with dignity

817
02:06:33,701 --> 02:06:36,551
Good-bye. Knowing you
are there gives me courage

818
02:06:46,547 --> 02:06:48,647
Behead me before my
wife recovers

819
02:06:51,552 --> 02:06:52,502
Your turn

820
02:06:58,726 --> 02:06:59,476
Stop!

821
02:07:04,899 --> 02:07:07,149
Get up! Get up!
Vasantsena is alive!

822
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:23,900
You are saved

823
02:07:26,754 --> 02:07:28,054
What's all this?

824
02:07:28,856 --> 02:07:31,956
He was accused of killing her.
She lives! Let him go!

825
02:07:35,596 --> 02:07:37,296
Truly? You are free then

826
02:07:40,434 --> 02:07:43,084
But the King's orders
mention no Vasantsena!

827
02:07:44,939 --> 02:07:47,389
Only a "courtesan"
- I am that courtesan

828
02:07:48,109 --> 02:07:49,409
Yes, this is she

829
02:07:50,444 --> 02:07:52,244
I should know. I saved her

830
02:07:53,447 --> 02:07:54,947
Let's ask Samsthanak

831
02:07:55,783 --> 02:07:58,233
He's here? Where?
He is the real culprit

832
02:08:04,959 --> 02:08:06,459
Vasantsena is alive!

833
02:08:12,466 --> 02:08:13,966
Bastard that I am...

834
02:08:14,802 --> 02:08:16,252
I tried to kill her

835
02:08:17,071 --> 02:08:18,921
Thank you, God!
She's alive!

836
02:08:23,477 --> 02:08:25,727
He's disappeared.
What do we do now?

837
02:09:09,123 --> 02:09:11,323
We are revolutionaries.
Let us pass

838
02:09:12,126 --> 02:09:14,226
Greetings! Aryak is
the new King!

839
02:09:15,863 --> 02:09:18,913
- Sajjal, one last favour.
- No, I must see Madanika

840
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:22,450
This drunken mob won't
listen. Change the flag

841
02:09:27,541 --> 02:09:29,241
All right. "Last favour"

842
02:09:48,229 --> 02:09:50,379
Sajjal, what are you doing there?

843
02:09:51,732 --> 02:09:54,032
I'm here. Waiting.
Come here at once!

844
02:10:32,606 --> 02:10:34,356
What grace! What agility!

845
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:42,780
We must keep our eyes on him.
A case worth tudying.

846
02:10:45,953 --> 02:10:46,703
Halt!

847
02:10:51,692 --> 02:10:52,592
Hear ye!

848
02:10:53,627 --> 02:10:55,927
There's been a revolution
in the city

849
02:10:55,963 --> 02:10:58,713
The tyrant is dethroned.
Aryak is the new King

850
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:05,920
Amnesty has been declared.
All prisoners are free.

851
02:11:16,984 --> 02:11:17,984
Lucky man!

852
02:12:02,296 --> 02:12:03,796
Where is Vasantsena?

853
02:12:05,032 --> 02:12:07,232
Let's go home.
Rohit will be crying

854
02:12:20,714 --> 02:12:22,964
Look! The brother-in-law
of the King
