- Let's go!
- Come on!

11
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,065
Why do you always cry
about going to school?

12
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,755
I won't take you
to school anymore.

13
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,155
Your father will take you.
Little rascal! Eat up!

14
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:26,925
You threw the food?

15
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,861
Uncouth brat! Do you know how many
people eat out of dustbins to live?

16
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:32,719
No more food for you.

17
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:40,448
Let's go and play after lunch break today.

18
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:42,268
Today I'll defeat you.

00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,609
(indistinct chatter)

20
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:29,666
Uncle, do you know where Mom is?

21
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,721
- She went home.
- Oh...

22
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:34,238
Hey!

23
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:36,978
What are these?

24
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:41,885
Mom!

25
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,775
Mom...

26
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,436
Mom!

27
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:48,968
Come.

28
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:52,372
Oh my!

29
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:54,413
What...

30
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:58,684
What are these, dear?

31
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,276
- Where did you find it?
- In the trash.

32
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,617
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

33
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:06,656
- Want some semolina?
- Yes.

34
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,530
Get some from Uncle Naru's shop
and I'll cook it.

35
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:10,805
Yes.

36
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:16,584
- Uncle Naru.
- Yes?

37
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:17,650
Semolina.

38
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,084
Semolina!

39
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,319
They have 360 bucks in debt
and he wants semolina!

40
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,267
Get lost!

41
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,156
Mom said that she will pay you.

42
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,671
Uncle Naru...

43
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,743
What are you watching on TV?

44
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:30,227
Boxing.

45
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,615
Ever seen it before?

46
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,774
The one who is punching
is Muhammad Ali.

47
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,441
And the one who is
getting punched is Foreman.

48
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,083
- You wanted semolina, right?
- Yes.

49
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,670
This is the last time.

50
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:43,202
Next time, don't come without money.

51
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,710
<i>Okay?</i>

52
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:57,838
Semolina?

53
00:05:58,377 --> 00:05:59,734
Boxing.

54
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,433
- Uncle Naru?
- Yes?

55
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,171
What are those ropes?

56
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:05,910
Those aren't ropes.

57
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,989
That's called a ring.

58
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:09,616
See how he's hitting him.

59
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,114
Wrong, wrong, wrong...

60
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:17,029
Not with two hands. One hand is needed to
guard the face and the other to punch.

61
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,061
I really loved it...

62
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:22,838
For real.

63
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,536
Ali, oh Ali!
My dearest Ali!

64
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:30,909
That thing they are
wearing on their hands...

65
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,361
I have a pair.

66
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:33,774
You have a pair?

67
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:34,877
Rubbish.

68
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:36,861
- I swear...
- Look at his feet.

69
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,916
Ali is the butterfly of boxing.

70
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,043
He flies like a butterfly,

71
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,059
And stings like a bee.

72
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:48,749
- He flies like...
- A butterfly.

73
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,645
- Butterfly...
- And stings like a bee.

74
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,457
He flies like a butterfly
And stings like a bee.

75
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:11,280
<i>The sweet truant
Can knock you out with a single punch</i>

76
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,933
<i>Come enjoy his show
Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

77
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,264
How many bulbs will you break?

78
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,922
Go practice outside.
Go!

79
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:23,311
<i>All may go where they please</i>

80
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:27,270
<i>But here he stays at ease
Shibaji!</i>

81
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:30,636
<i>These gloves make him a Champ
One blow ends the game</i>

82
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:32,620
<i>Oh my God!</i>

83
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:37,032
<i>Monkeys run right up the trees
And elephants run fast</i>

84
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:41,286
<i>Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

85
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:45,340
<i>The sweet truant
Can knock you out with a single punch</i>

86
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:51,292
<i>Come enjoy his show
Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

87
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,863
- Is Uncle Naru there?
- No.

88
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:11,228
<i>Come all, big and small
Come and watch his show</i>

89
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,291
<i>The punches are flying
Come and watch Muhammad's disciple</i>

90
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:23,146
<i>Come all, big and small
Come and watch his show</i>

91
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,099
<i>The punches are flying
Come and watch Muhammad's disciple</i>

92
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,064
<i>He's opening all doors
And walking to train every morn</i>

93
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,286
<i>That early in the morning?</i>

94
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,061
<i>Come and see
How he dances on his heels</i>

95
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:51,005
<i>Come all, young and old
Come and watch the game</i>

96
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,107
<i>Cycles "cring" "cring"
Rolling heavy</i>

97
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:59,576
<i>I don't want to get back on it
I just want to sink</i>

98
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:03,265
<i>Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

99
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:07,321
<i>The sweet truant
Can knock you out with a single punch</i>

100
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:11,329
<i>Come enjoy his show Shibaji!</i>

101
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:17,495
<i>And now at the very end
He is ready to go</i>

102
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,304
<i>Shibaji!</i>

103
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,712
<i>A second glance or sweep of air
And if you hit, you win</i>

104
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:24,820
<i>Oh my!</i>

105
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:29,214
<i>Monkeys run right up the trees
And elephants run fast</i>

106
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:33,319
<i>Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

107
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:37,303
<i>The sweet truant
Can knock you out with a single punch</i>

108
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:43,290
<i>Come enjoy his show
Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

109
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:47,223
<i>The sweet truant
Can knock you out with a single punch</i>

110
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:55,423
<i>Come enjoy his show
Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

111
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,735
Slowly...

112
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:09,282
Careful.

113
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,981
Get up.

114
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:19,460
Let's go.

115
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,625
You think I'll go
for free or what?

116
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:22,888
Get lost!

117
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,642
I beg of you.

118
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,317
If I don't get him to the hospital,
he will not make it.

119
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,150
So what can I do?
I will not move without money.

120
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:32,047
Please try and understand.

121
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,583
- I am helpless!
- Get lost!

122
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:34,697
Too much drama...

123
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,690
I promise I will pay
you back later.

124
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,195
- I beg of you...
- Just get lost!

125
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,907
- Please...
- Too much drama for the morning.

126
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,438
Don't cry. Just take a bus.

127
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,494
Please help me...

128
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,706
- Just get out!
- I promise to pay you back.

129
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,555
I have other passengers.
So leave!

130
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,730
What has happened to him?

131
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,587
He is very ill.

132
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,325
If he doesn't reach the hospital,
he will die.

133
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,975
Hey! This car runs on oil, not water.

134
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,887
- And you need money to buy oil.
- How much?

135
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,462
During the Durga festival,
it's a minimum of Rs.2000.

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,017
Drive fast.

137
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,345
But you needed the money
for your mother.

138
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,939
So what? It came to the aid
of another mother.

139
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,629
Hey, drive safely.

140
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:23,113
Everything will be fine.

141
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:25,232
- May God bless you.
- Bye.

142
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,699
Hey!

143
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:36,898
My bicycle!

144
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,585
Pull over.

145
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,329
Yes!

146
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,249
Won it!

147
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,256
- Hey.
- Hey...

148
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,542
What's your name?

149
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:29,700
Shibaji Sanyal.

150
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,089
Shibaji Sanyal...

151
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:32,486
Is your father a boxer?

152
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,304
- Are you trained in boxing?
- Who you are?

153
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:36,566
Samar Bagchi.

154
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,208
They call me Buro Bagchi.

155
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:40,330
Anyone in your family?

156
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,528
That's enough.

157
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:50,639
I am the boxing trainer
at the Maidan Youth Club.

158
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:54,853
I came here
to judge a sports tournament.

159
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:59,263
On my way back, I saw your son
fighting with his gloves on.

160
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,996
I observed him for a while.

161
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,291
He's a little crazy.

162
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:12,328
He's been doing this
ever since he got the gloves.

163
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,899
I have come to you with a request.

164
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:20,320
I think your son has the spirit
of a boxer hidden within him.

165
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,610
I want him to become a boxer.

166
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,729
If it's a job, then...

167
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,094
Mom.

168
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:33,656
We are very poor.

169
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,385
- Why, Mom?
- I want to take your son to Kolkata.

170
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,131
No, Mom.

171
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,372
He...

172
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,558
My son can't even
go to sleep without me.

173
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,958
He can't...

174
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:49,282
He has to stand on his own feet.

175
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,901
Sir...

176
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,830
Is there any money in boxing?

177
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,059
Uncle!

178
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,917
Leave that to me.

179
00:14:58,057 --> 00:15:00,186
One day, your son...

180
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,250
...will be great!

181
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,503
No, no...

182
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,479
How can I go to Kolkata?

183
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:08,392
Who will take care of my mother?

184
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:10,027
No, Mom.

185
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:12,185
You have to stand
on your own feet.

186
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:13,955
Don't you?

187
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:18,722
Your mother will
always be close to you.

188
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,669
Always.

189
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,000
Forever.

190
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,576
Come in.

191
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,785
All the windows are shut.

192
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,889
It's like a dark cave.

193
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,650
What are you looking at?
That thing?

194
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,327
That's a ventilator.
Used to clean the air.

195
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:13,890
And if it rains...

196
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:17,250
Then I will fit this here.

197
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:19,836
The world will give you nothing.

198
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,523
You will have to adjust to that.

199
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,129
Now he's in for it!

200
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,041
Shibaji.

201
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:33,608
Boxer!

202
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:36,402
- Another one?
- Yes, another one.

203
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,208
Your face will need reconstruction, dude.

204
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,756
Don't listen to this man.

205
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,975
No one knows what
life may throw at us.

206
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,459
Life here works
in a different style here, boss.

207
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:47,872
My sister.

208
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:52,546
Sathi.

209
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:57,555
A junior artist
in the film industry.

210
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:58,878
My brother is a boxer.

211
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:01,029
And this house is...

212
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,680
...the House of Dreams.

213
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,585
You could call it
the launching pad.

214
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,968
All the best, boss!

215
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:14,914
God forgot to tell her
that she is a girl.

216
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:17,956
Tell me.

217
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:21,292
This is the boy I was
talking about. Shibaji.

218
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,941
- Hello.
- Very talented.

219
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:27,011
For now, around Rs. 20,000
should be good.

220
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:29,789
He needs to buy new gloves
and training costs money.

221
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,064
Just shut it!

222
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,471
You keep bringing these boxers
and they disappear in no time.

223
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,423
But sir, he is different.
He is a diamond!

224
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,475
Who knows if he's a diamond
or a just coal?

225
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,670
Tell me?

226
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:41,804
Listen.

227
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:46,967
I could have sponsored him.
But the market is in terrible shape.

228
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,892
At a time like this,
no one will agree...

229
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:54,630
to sponsor a "no one" like him.
Not even for 20 bucks, let alone 20,000.

230
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:58,260
- Let's go.
- Your tea.

231
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:00,236
Maybe some other time.

232
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,656
Come.

233
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,187
Hello?

234
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,973
One minute.

235
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:20,306
I can manage to get you free
training at the Youth Club.

236
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:22,100
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

237
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:23,582
Let's go.

238
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,676
Practice for free, huh?

239
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,471
Taking pity on us.
Bloody ancient gym!

240
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,416
What a run-down shack.
Rubbish!

241
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,074
He called me "no one".

242
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,598
What do you mean?

243
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:36,463
It's because you are not known
in the boxing circuit yet.

244
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,152
Wow! Buro Bagchi.
What's the deal?

245
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:41,327
I am still working for
"Deenkhan Patrika".

246
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:43,890
Okay, that's good!

247
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:46,040
Could you do something?

248
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:48,112
Could you do something for him
as a journalist?

249
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,303
Backing?

250
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,740
He will go back himself.

251
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,683
An unsmart boy like him
will never be a boxer.

252
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,839
Don't talk rubbish!

253
00:18:58,482 --> 00:18:59,776
Play cricket.

254
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,363
Become the next Dhoni.

255
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,172
And you'll have your own film.
Dhoni Azhar.

256
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,553
Boxing, boxing...

257
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,084
Crazy people!

258
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,746
Go away.

259
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,377
Let it go.

260
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,579
Start practising first.

261
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:16,603
This is just the beginning.
Ignore it.

262
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:18,696
Rubbish talk! Let's go.

263
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,711
Come on.

264
00:19:44,352 --> 00:19:46,143

265
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,138

<i>You are the Champ</i>

<i>You are the Champ</i>

278
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:28,420
Wait. You first need to know
your target area.

279
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,010
The first area is the temple.

280
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:31,951
Then the chin.

281
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:34,145
And this area is the solar plexus.

282
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,630
We need to know the weak points.

283
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:37,201
These are the floating ribs.

284
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:40,074
We need to know where to hit.

285
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:51,017
<i>These turbulent times</i>

286
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:55,152
<i>Make the heart heavy</i>

287
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:58,502
<i>Not all doors are shut</i>

<i>As the past calls you back</i>

289
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:05,676
<i>I search for myself in a hole I dug</i>

290
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,838

- Shiba!
- Yes?

310
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,724
Come to eat.

311
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:51,417
Sit.
Take the flat bread.

312
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:53,803
Here you go.

313
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:56,121
Take some curry and pluses too.

314
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:57,900
And eggs.

315
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,313
Here.

316
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:02,257
Hold it, quick!
Or my food will get burnt.

317
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,519
Burnt!

318
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:06,691
So many eggs?

319
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,083
You need protein
to make the body solid.

320
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,215
You need those.
The National Trials are coming up.

321
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:14,405
Eight eggs on a regular basis.

322
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,072
Who are you thinking about?

323
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,126
Your mother?

324
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,059
My mom would cut
an egg with a thread...

325
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,311
...and make two halves.

326
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,285
I'd eat one half during the day,
and one half at night.

327
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:33,363
And I never asked her
whether she had eaten.

328
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:39,431
I have something for you.

329
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:40,916
I'll get it.

330
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:51,339
Here. See if you like it.

331
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:55,697
Open it!

332
00:23:57,454 --> 00:23:59,204
Do you like them?

333
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,883
- Boxing gloves! For me?
- Hmm.

334
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:07,972
You are doing so much for me.

335
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,823
Not me.

336
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:12,480
Look there.

337
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,313
She sold her gold necklace...

338
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:16,362
to buy your gloves.

339
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:18,043
Sathi!

340
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:19,508
Won't you eat?

341
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,116
Come on! Food is ready.

342
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:45,880
Eat up.

343
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,083
Come on.

344
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,446
You sold your necklace?

345
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,869
Hey, you have to return it.

346
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:10,640
When you...

347
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:14,886
become a famous boxer
with a lot of money.

348
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,695
Then you can return it.

349
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,656
And if I become a famous actress...

350
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,269
You can buy me a
thick, gold necklace.

351
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:25,132
Else, it will hurt my prestige.
Done! Deal!

352
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:30,799
The truth is that...

353
00:25:31,593 --> 00:25:33,635
We are both dwarves.

354
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:34,954
- Oh really?
- Hmm.

355
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,053
Trying to reach the moon.

356
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,712
That's true.

357
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,208
I want to tell you something else.

358
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:47,355
Go for it.

359
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:49,260
I won't say it now.

360
00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:51,538
Why?

361
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:54,324
When you become really famous...

362
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:57,833
Really, really famous...

363
00:25:57,877 --> 00:26:00,483
When you become the champion,
that's when I'll tell you.

364
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,401
Red!
Blue!

365
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,236
Bout number four.

366
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:13,334
In the red corner, Arijit Singh.

367
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,437
Blue corner, Shibaji Sanyal.

368
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:16,929
Ready for box?

369
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,294
First round!

370
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:25,186
Fantastic!

371
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,718
- Come on! Come on!
- Bravo!

372
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:40,215
End it fast!

373
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:44,462
Break.

374
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,128
Keep going, Shiba!

375
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:57,175
Break!

376
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:03,636
Sit down.
Fan him.

377
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,667
It's going well.
Very well.

378
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,325
But watch out.

379
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:10,413
He's keeping his left side open.
Take advantage.

380
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,744
Go on, full power!

381
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:33,562
Come on, do it!

382
00:27:37,361 --> 00:27:38,658
Break!

383
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,504
Stop!

384
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,283
Result, bout number four.

385
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,434
Winner, Red corner, Arijit Singh.

386
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:04,799
Yeah!

387
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:06,124
- Yes!
- What?

388
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:11,354
The one who played well! The best!
How can he lose?

389
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:15,519
- Go home! You can't do anything thing.
- This is politics! Bloody politics!

390
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,863
You are the reason
the country is in this condition.

391
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:19,634
The standard of our sports
has dropped so bloody low.

392
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,997
- This is why there is no progress!
- Get over it.

393
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:24,690
- No progress in sports!
- Stop blabbing. Get lost!

394
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:26,071
- Go home!
- Rubbish!

395
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:27,741
Damn it!

396
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:30,513
They cheated us with politics.

397
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,529
I convinced your mother
and brought you here...

398
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:38,251
And they got rid of you
in the first round of the Nationals?

399
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,879
Maybe all this is not for me.

400
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:44,541
I don't think I'm capable.

401
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:47,858
I'd better go back to the village.

402
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:49,590
Look at me.

403
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:51,897
Yes.
Do you know what Sathi does?

404
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:56,190
She says that she is a junior artist.
But that's a lie.

405
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:58,413
She is the actress' caretaker.

406
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:00,023
She carries her make up bags...

407
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,341
Holds her umbrella...

408
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,063
But she keeps fighting!

409
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:06,483
She believes she will make it
as an actress.

410
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,483
We all have to fight.

411
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:10,189
So what if you've lost once?

412
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,705
There will be trials again.
And we will fight again.

413
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,245
No problem.
Now let's go.

414
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,086
Let's go refresh our minds.

415
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,566
Let me show you
a different kind of boxing.

416
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:21,581
Don't stand around!
Let's go!

417
00:29:21,663 --> 00:29:22,774
Come on.

418
00:29:28,823 --> 00:29:33,862
Ten for Rs. 100.

419
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,805
A hundred for 500.

420
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,169
Come on!

421
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:14,510
Hey! Get up!

422
00:30:26,153 --> 00:30:27,485
Come on!

423
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:33,860
Hit him!

424
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:40,684
Is there anyone else...

425
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:43,284
...willing to fight me?

426
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,173
Hey, let's go.

427
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:46,507
Is there anyone?

428
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,712
Who can fight me?

429
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:51,116
Wait.

430
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,973
Go on, fight him.

431
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:54,180
Hey!

432
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:55,377
He won't fight.

433
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:57,329
Just get lost!

434
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:59,567
You've lost your mind.

435
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,916
Vishal, if this kid loses to you,
the odds will be 200 for 100.

436
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:06,958
If you lose to him,
the odds will be 500 for 100.

437
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,542
- Agreed?
- Damn right!

438
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:12,037
- Let's begin.
- You won't fight. Let's go.

439
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:13,602
Hey, you son of a b♪♪♪h!

440
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:15,061
Come in if you have the guts!

441
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:29,866
Come on!

442
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:37,469
Come on! Come on!

443
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:49,610
Take a moment to remember
your dad's name for the last time.

444
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,375
And you better pray...

445
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,619
because Shibaji is coming for you!

446
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:16,296
Beat him, Shiba!
Hit!

447
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:18,379
Place your bets!

448
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:25,395
There's my tiger!

449
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,418
How about 800 for 100?
Place your bets!

450
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:53,790
Hit him!

451
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:19,907
What a good fight, bro!
Here's 10,000 bucks. Have fun!

452
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,140
And come tomorrow night.

453
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,793
- Earn every night...
- Hey! Move!

454
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:25,209
Hey, Buro Da.
Is he new?

455
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,968
He is not from here.

456
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:29,047
He fought only because
he pissed him off.

457
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:31,682
What are you talking about?
He is hot property!

458
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:32,788
Get him to fight.

459
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:36,330
We can all make money.
Let him fight!

460
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:39,040
Don't talk rubbish!
Shut up!

461
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:40,738
- Buro Da?
- Let's go!

462
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,551
Eat all the unhealthy food you want today.

463
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,447
Tomorrow you'll run five miles extra.

464
00:33:51,472 --> 00:33:53,369
You'll need to lose the calories.

465
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:54,930
- Tell me, Buro Da...
- Yeah?

466
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:57,083
What kind of boxing is this?
So much money!

467
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,430
Is gambling.

468
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:00,319
It's not official boxing.

469
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,180
There is another kind
of official boxing.

470
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:05,533
It's called professional boxing.

471
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:08,688
Professional boxing?

472
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:12,292
Nationals, Olympics...
That's amateur boxing.

473
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,576
The entry into amateur boxing
is very difficult.

474
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:18,086
Getting in to professional boxing
is much simpler.

475
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,749
Much easier.
But there's more risk and more action.

476
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:22,757
Professional boxing has three divisions.

477
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,850
National, Continental
and World Championship.

478
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,495
If you win at the National level,
you can play the Continental matches.

479
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,344
If you win at the Continental level,
you can compete the World Championship.

480
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,361
If you can make a name for yourself
in the professional boxing circuit...

481
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:38,974
...you'll start getting many sponsors.

482
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:40,628
There will be betting.

483
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:42,263
And betting brings money.

484
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,306
In India.boxing was introduced
by a Bengali.

485
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,120
Paresh Lal Ray.

486
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:51,066
If you ask me...

487
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:57,297
I would want a Bengali from Kolkata
to be the World Champion.

488
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,761
So, do you want to be
the World Champion?

489
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:17,565
<i>Akram attacking.</i>

490
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:20,612
<i>Straight on.
Right to the face. Left uppercut!</i>

491
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:22,398
<i>Tough situation.</i>

492
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:25,573
<i>Akram Khan straight to the left hook
and then right hook!</i>

493
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,596
<i>And Shibaji Sanyal has fallen back.</i>

494
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:32,802
You were hitting from a distance.

495
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,433
Don't be orthodox.

496
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,637
Change your technique.

497
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:39,190
You have 20 seconds.

498
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,635
Finish him by then, okay?

499
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:46,365
<i>Shibaji dodged Akram's punch.</i>

500
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,016
<i>Shibaji hit him with a left hook.</i>

501
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:50,998
<i>Shibaji's counter attack.</i>

502
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,603
<i>Right hook to the chin.
Akram Khan knocked out!</i>

503
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,460
<i>Shibaji Sanyal is the winner.</i>

504
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:07,720
Buro Bagchi?

505
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:10,814
Wait a minute.

506
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,790
You saw the last match?

507
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:15,013
Saw him win?

508
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:17,414
Hmm. Fluke.
Fluke?

509
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:20,168
Bengalis cannot box.

510
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,946
Get him to play cricket.

511
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,830
Boxing!

512
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:26,548
- Shantanu.
- Don't bulls♪♪t me!

513
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:29,429
Don't bulls♪♪t me.
I've been in this line for 22 years.

514
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:31,845
I've got a headache
from all the bulls♪♪t.

515
00:36:32,186 --> 00:36:35,281
And imagine my luck.
I have to cover this sport to survive.

516
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,607
Shantanu, don't forget
to watch the title match.

517
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,981
- He'll win the belt?
- Of course he will.

518
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:44,941
He can't even move
his hands and legs properly.

519
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:46,420
Know who your opponent is?

520
00:36:46,452 --> 00:36:47,738
Prashant Singh.

521
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,587
You'll piss yourself in the ring.

522
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,865
You may leave.

523
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,198
Why?

524
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:54,079
I'm finding it hard to practice.

525
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,808
Your kid has become
a real prima Donna.

526
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,241
You know who I am?

527
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,019
Does he know who I am?

528
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:03,459
Check out the headlines tomorrow.
"The Bengali's defeated!"

529
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,007
You are really something...

530
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,640
I swear!

531
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,831
You Should've kept quiet.

532
00:37:10,337 --> 00:37:11,462
Continue.

533
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:14,062
Hit hard.

534
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,407
<i>Natural pro, Shibaji Sanyal
versus Prashant Singh.</i>

535
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:33,416
Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!

536
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:35,264
<i>...opponent Shibaji Sanyal.</i>

537
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,048
Shibaji!

538
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,774
Yes! Yes!

539
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,053
Red corner, Prashant Singh.

540
00:38:14,078 --> 00:38:16,863
Blue corner, Shibaji Sanyal!

541
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,204
Hey, you Bengali!
You're going to fight me?

542
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:20,948
Run home to your fish and rice!

543
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:25,696
<i>Shibaji attacks immediately.</i>

544
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:29,288
<i>Prashant's counter attack
gets Shibaji's left hook...</i>

545
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:30,546
Hit back!

546
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:31,855
<i>And right hook!</i>

547
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:34,339
<i>Prashant serves two consecutive blows.</i>

548
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,164
<i>Right hook..Shibaji's left hook!
Thrown back to the ring!</i>

549
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,839
<i>What a shot!</i>

550
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:42,283
- Shantanu.
- Yes?

551
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:45,125
- What do you think?
- A Bengali boxer? Hmmph!

552
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,791
He'll do it! Just watch...

553
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,307
Yes!

554
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,925
<i>Consecutive attacks.</i>

555
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:56,727
<i>Now comes Prashant Singh's counter attack.
He's like a machine gun firing!</i>

556
00:38:56,783 --> 00:39:00,975
<i>Shibaji is down in the red corner
and there goes the bell.</i>

557
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:02,544
What do you think?

558
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,417
Will Shibaji come out alive?

559
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,811
He'll win for sure.
Just wait.

560
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:10,526
Target his left jaw.

561
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:13,708
Shibaji, Shibaji...

562
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,134
Shibaji, Shibaji...

563
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:23,024
Shibaji, Shibaji, Shibaji!

564
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:25,857
What are you doing?
It will start now.

565
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:28,792
- Shibaji, Shibaji!
- Stop it!

566
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,020
Shibaji! Shibaji!

567
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:36,115
(all cheering) Shibaji! Shibaji!

568
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:45,350
<i>Next round.
Shibaji attacks from the left.</i>

569
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,771
<i>Singh resists.
Prashant counter attacks.</i>

570
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,415
Focus, Shiba! Focus!

571
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,137
Don't look at anything else.

572
00:39:53,614 --> 00:39:56,423
Only his forehead, nose and jaw.

573
00:39:56,693 --> 00:39:59,844
<i>Shibaji attacks with a right hook
and Singh... No!</i>

574
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,868
<i>Singh moves and ducks.
Left hook!</i>

575
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:05,543
Shibaji!
Come on!

576
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:07,845
(all cheering) Shibaji, Shibaji!

577
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:21,004
<i>Shibaji Sanyal attacks with right punch
but Singh hits with right uppercut.</i>

578
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,068
Get up!

579
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:24,653
<i>Sanyal has been knocked down.</i>

580
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:28,915
<i>Shibaji Sanyal is on the back foot
in tactic and experience.</i>

581
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:33,455
Fight! Fight, Shiba! Fight!

582
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:35,933
Don't get punched anymore.
Deliver the punches now.

583
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,123
Will you remember?

584
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:40,234
Fly like a butterfly
and sting like a bee!

585
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:41,408
Get him!

586
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,241
Yeah, hit him!

587
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:46,297
<i>...right hook!
Singh is on the hook!</i>

588
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,797
<i>Shibaji is like a tiger out for blood!</i>

589
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:51,026
That's it!

590
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:53,773
<i>Sanyal rains punches
at lightning speed.</i>

591
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:00,851
<i>And Prashant Singh,
title defender, knocked out!</i>

592
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,699
Yay! Shibaji!

593
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:09,265
You're the Champ! Yes!

594
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:15,325
<i>And the new title winner...</i>

595
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:17,818
<i>Shibaji Sanyal!</i>

596
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:19,095
Wonderful!

597
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,900
No looking back.

598
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,487
Now only forward!

599
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:25,340
Shibaji, Shibaji Shibaji!

600
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:26,781
This is for you.

601
00:41:26,806 --> 00:41:30,206
(all cheering) Shibaji, Shibaji, Shibaji!

602
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:43,222
Here's the Champ!

603
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:44,920
- Yes!
- Yeah!

604
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:47,296
DEENKHAN PATRIKA
BENGAL TIGER WINS WORLD PROFESSIONAL BOXING

605
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:49,841
Bengal Tiger wins the title
in World Professional Boxing.

606
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,290
Tiger?

607
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:54,950
I see that our paper is selling
cockroaches as birds.

608
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,375
Delete it.

609
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:57,813
Why?

610
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,396
A young guy is rising...

611
00:41:59,454 --> 00:42:02,287
Yes! And he will uproot our
entire newspaper with him.

612
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:05,578
Write...

613
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,490
The World of boxing...

614
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,228
...sees the decline of Prashant Singh.

615
00:42:09,603 --> 00:42:10,982
It's the same thing.

616
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:12,850
If you call Shibaji Sanyal a tiger...

617
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:15,212
...will people recognise him?
Change it.

618
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,378
Dad?

619
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:19,870
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

620
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:21,442
Have you seen this?

621
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:22,434
DEENKHAN PATRIKA WORLD
PROFESSIONAL BOXING SEES SINGH'S DEFEAT

622
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:26,708
A Bengali guy is rising.
He fought hard!

623
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,506
And he's not even in the headlines.

624
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,298
The loser made the headlines!

625
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:31,608
Prashant Singh.

626
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,417
Is this even reporting, Dad?

627
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:34,820
- Quite natural.
- Is this...

628
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:35,852
Huh?

629
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:37,344
Prashant should be
in the headlines.

630
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:38,666
Wow, Dad!

631
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,083
Shibaji's fight means nothing?
Why?

632
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:44,129
Just because he's a Bengali? Huh!

633
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:46,113
Fine, I'll tell Shantanu.

634
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:49,160
No, no. You don't have
to tell him anything.

635
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,303
One day, Shibaji will give a fitting reply.

636
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:55,025
Okay, we'll see.

637
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:57,065
Oh, shoot!

638
00:42:57,864 --> 00:43:00,281
I have a meeting!
Bye.

639
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,583
Just you watch!
Shibaji will show us what he's made of.

640
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,294
- Waiting for that day.
- Okay, bye!

641
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,943
I love you.

642
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:14,350
I swear it, Shiba!

643
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:17,571
I love you more than my own life!

644
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:21,319
Shiba!

645
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,809
I love...

646
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:42,740
I am waiting...

647
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:45,450
for the day...

648
00:43:45,654 --> 00:43:46,742
...for the day I tell you.

649
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:48,236
Shiba!

650
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,307
I love you!

651
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:04,252
Hi.

652
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,000
- I ordered when I saw you guys.
- The coffee is really good.

653
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:16,180
- Are your semester exams over?
- No, next month.

654
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:18,815
- How many are down...
- Hey guys, look. Shibaji!

655
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,196
Sir, one selfie, please.

656
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,322
This way.

657
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:24,034
- Sir, one selfie.
- Sir, one autograph.

658
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:25,981
Let's keep it moving.

659
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:28,010
No more, sorry.
Let's go!

660
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:29,482
Oh my God!

661
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:31,119
Let us through.

662
00:44:31,783 --> 00:44:33,188
- Good morning, please come.
- Good morning.

663
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,203
He's so handsome!

664
00:44:35,377 --> 00:44:38,053
- Do you know him?
- No.

665
00:44:38,096 --> 00:44:42,792
- You guys wait. I'll take a selfie.
- What? It's embarrassing!

666
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:45,208
Our client is Top Tech TMT Bars.

667
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,081
They manufacture the iron bars
needed for building construction.

668
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:50,144
Okay.

669
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:54,393
And the company wants sir
to be their brand ambassador.

670
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:55,967
I'm a huge fan.

671
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:57,269
- Alright.
- Can I get a selfie?

672
00:44:57,351 --> 00:45:00,650
At the moment,
his world ranking is pretty high.

673
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,705
After this is the Asia Pacific
and then the World Championship.

674
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,856
I'm sure you understand.

675
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,947
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

676
00:45:05,972 --> 00:45:09,388
Before offering, please consider...

677
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:14,838
...that the minimum amount
should not be less than...

678
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:16,973
Show me!

679
00:45:17,663 --> 00:45:18,670
She's so lucky.

680
00:45:18,695 --> 00:45:20,142
Don't worry about the advance.

681
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,333
Just quote the amount.
No problem.

682
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:24,981
- How much?
- One.

683
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:26,592
One lakh rupees?

684
00:45:27,263 --> 00:45:28,638
One crore rupees.

685
00:45:32,203 --> 00:45:32,703
Papers?

686
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:34,250
Today was so much fun.

687
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:36,333
I swear! We should
really do this more often.

688
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,845
- And the coffee was great!
- Seriously! It was so good!

689
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,267
Anyway, where's your car?

690
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:42,664
I think it's in the parking lot.
No problem, I'll find it.

691
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,003
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!

692
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:45,861
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, bye!

693
00:46:01,113 --> 00:46:04,042
- How are you, Jaya?
- I'm good. How are you?

694
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:05,518
Surviving.

695
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,343
Know who she is?

696
00:46:08,634 --> 00:46:10,947
Narottam sir's daughter, Jaya.

697
00:46:10,972 --> 00:46:12,121
Oh.

698
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:13,875
- Hi.
- Hello.

699
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,974
Oh.
Hello.

700
00:46:17,264 --> 00:46:18,820
I'm going home.
You come later.

701
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:34,330
Hey...

702
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:36,425
- Thank you.
- Huh?

703
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:43,179
You were my only supporter
in the match against Prashant Singh.

704
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:46,424
No, no... You fought so well that...

705
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:49,400
...everyone was
bound to support you.

706
00:46:49,425 --> 00:46:50,925
Maybe.

707
00:46:51,465 --> 00:46:53,575
But you were my first supporter.

708
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:55,458
Thank you.

709
00:46:55,673 --> 00:46:56,804
One selfie?

710
00:46:56,829 --> 00:46:58,579
- No, no, it's okay...
- I want one.

711
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:02,663
- You want one with me?
- Yes.

712
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:07,206
If you cold come a little closer...

713
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:18,118
Your car?

714
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:20,063
I'll take a cab.

715
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:21,168
Oh...

716
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:22,773
Your car?

717
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:25,248
I'm catching a cab too.

718
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,491
Cabbie!

719
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,728
In the title match
against Prashant Singh...

720
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,420
...you fought really well!

721
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:41,705
Oh.

722
00:47:42,883 --> 00:47:46,134
No, I don't understand boxing at all.

723
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:49,680
It's just that my Dad said...

724
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,355
...that a Bengali boxer rising fast.
Shibaji Sanyal.

725
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:56,948
A Bengali boxer?
Sorry to say...

726
00:47:57,061 --> 00:47:59,538
...but very unusual combination.

727
00:48:02,502 --> 00:48:04,022
Are you from Kolkata?

728
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:06,022
No.

729
00:48:06,768 --> 00:48:09,375
I'm from a village
called Lagda in Purulia.

730
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,196
- Purulia?
- Hmm.

731
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:14,884
So, why boxing?

732
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:18,675
That's a long story.

733
00:48:25,686 --> 00:48:27,139
<i>I am here because of Buro Da.</i>

734
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:34,332
So... what are you planning next?

735
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:36,352
I just won the title.

736
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:39,101
Next is the Continental Championship.

737
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:41,306
But before that, I have
a few regular matches.

738
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:44,058
The Asia Pacific Championship.

739
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,467
Wow! Asia Pacific title?

740
00:48:47,196 --> 00:48:50,775
That means the next step
is the World Championship, right?

741
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:54,751
Even better! A Bengali World Champion!

742
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,229
Amazing!

743
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:59,316
Madam
Let me win the Asia Pacific first.

744
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:02,267
Listen.
I truly believe...

745
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:05,355
...that you will be
the World Champion one day.

746
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:27,719
Bye.

747
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:29,148
Bye.

748
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:32,163
This is my house.

749
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:33,471
Oh...

750
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:40,745
So, text me once you reach?

751
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:41,999
Yes.

752
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,940
But I don't have your number.

753
00:49:47,476 --> 00:49:48,824
It's 9830-

754
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:50,110
One minute...

755
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:55,800
It's 9830235342.
Okay?

756
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,831
- Yes.
- Bye.

757
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,260
Bye.

758
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:42,432
What happened?

759
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:51,773
Good morning.

760
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:52,975
<i>Good morning.</i>

761
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:54,019
How are you?

762
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:55,396
<i>I'm good.
What's up?</i>

763
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,701
I'm...

764
00:50:57,745 --> 00:50:58,868
I...

765
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:01,486
...was thinking about you.

766
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:02,850
<i>About me?</i>

767
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:03,891
What are you doing?

768
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:08,098
<i>Even I was...
I mean I'm thinking about your next match.</i>

769
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,082
You were thinking about me?

770
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:12,568
<i>Why not?</i>

771
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:16,988
<i>What's wrong?
Any problem?</i>

772
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:18,298
Yeah, I mean...

773
00:51:20,817 --> 00:51:22,481
Hello?
Hello?

774
00:51:22,506 --> 00:51:24,711
The Asia Pacific match
is up next.

775
00:51:24,926 --> 00:51:26,672
You have to be there to help me win.

776
00:51:26,926 --> 00:51:28,307
<i>For sure.</i>

777
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:30,568
Thank you.
Can I call you later?

778
00:51:30,882 --> 00:51:32,084
One second.
I'll call you back.

779
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:32,870
<i>Yeah, bye.</i>

780
00:51:32,895 --> 00:51:34,147
Bye!

781
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:41,321
What's the matter, Miss Actress?

782
00:51:41,346 --> 00:51:42,805
What's with the attitude?

783
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,456
Who are you angry with?

784
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:48,110
Let me go. I have work.

785
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:52,480
So much work, huh?

786
00:51:53,232 --> 00:51:54,429
Wait.

787
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:11,180
Take it.

788
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:16,338
All debts have been cleared.

789
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:19,656
You think you can clear all debts?

790
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,672
What else have you loaned me?

791
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:25,265
<i>My heart, Shiba.
But you never accepted it.</i>

792
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:26,545
Hey!

793
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,767
Why the hose pipe?

794
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:32,323
You had something to say.
Tell me.

795
00:52:40,442 --> 00:52:42,359
Keep your hand on my head.

796
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:45,162
Bless me so I may win like you.

797
00:52:45,187 --> 00:52:49,062
Or else, I will keep losing
to people my entire life.

798
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:51,169
And listen...

799
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:56,952
For your next match...
All the best, boss!

800
00:52:58,461 --> 00:52:59,915
You won't come?

801
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:05,030
<i>The fight is between Carlos Ottawa
and Shibaji Sanyal.</i>

802
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:07,633
<i>A huge round of applause
for the masters over here.</i>

803
00:53:07,689 --> 00:53:09,625
<i>Carlos, straight blow to the chin.</i>

804
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,856
<i>An uppercut to the body.</i>

805
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:13,881
(commentary continues)

806
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:18,844
Come on!

807
00:53:24,189 --> 00:53:25,952
Back! Back!

808
00:53:35,081 --> 00:53:36,295
Oh yes!

809
00:53:37,136 --> 00:53:38,136
Yes!

810
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,534
Ready to box?

811
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:45,080
Box!

812
00:53:50,945 --> 00:53:55,278
<i>Carlos knocked out unconscious
and out of form.</i>

813
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,065
You were fantastic today.
Amazing!

814
00:54:06,364 --> 00:54:07,447
Knock out!

815
00:54:07,472 --> 00:54:09,222
It's becoming your style.

816
00:54:12,347 --> 00:54:13,491
- Well done.
- Thank you.

817
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,766
Narottam sir, meet Shibaji.

818
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:17,886
- The wonder boy!
- Wish him.

819
00:54:22,271 --> 00:54:23,521
Hello.

820
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:27,533
Congratulations.

821
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,655
Let's move?

822
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:35,252
Bye.

823
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:36,860
- Bye.
- Bye.

824
00:54:43,522 --> 00:54:44,522
WHAT'S UP?

825
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,116
WHAT'S UP?

826
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:49,156
THINKING ABOUT YOU

827
00:54:49,196 --> 00:54:50,894
THINKING ABOUT YOU

828
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,116
REALLY?

829
00:54:54,403 --> 00:54:55,712
YES, REALLY

830
00:54:56,784 --> 00:55:00,322
<i>There was a lot unsaid
Like a starlit evening</i>

831
00:55:00,385 --> 00:55:03,544
<i>And then in a hurry
The stars started calling me</i>

832
00:55:03,912 --> 00:55:10,718
<i>In the bed of grass
The kiss of sleep puts the night out</i>

833
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:18,035
<i>Sleep eludes us and stays at bay
As the mast stands alone</i>

834
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:25,344
<i>I kept my promise, I came to you
And your presence drove away all the wrong</i>

835
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:32,455
<i>Jaya, a touch of your finger
Helps the flowers bloom</i>

836
00:55:32,655 --> 00:55:40,161
<i>Jaya, a touch of your finger
Helps the flowers bloom</i>

837
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,082
A GORGEOUS KNOCK-OUT

838
00:55:54,547 --> 00:55:58,705
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

839
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:05,860
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

840
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:13,126
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

841
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:20,277
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

842
00:56:23,577 --> 00:56:26,934
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

843
00:56:38,581 --> 00:56:42,216
<i>I had some thing to say to you
You had told me the story before</i>

844
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:45,700
<i>With you all over my thoughts</i>

845
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:52,653
<i>A light smile on the lip, a look in the eye
And the good times seemed to flow over</i>

846
00:56:52,678 --> 00:56:59,929
<i>Sleep eludes us and stays at bay
As the mast stands alone</i>

847
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:06,708
<i>I kept my promise, I came to you
And your presence drove away all the wrong</i>

848
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:14,360
<i>Jaya, a touch of your finger
Helps the flowers bloom</i>

849
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:22,427
<i>Jaya, a touch of your finger
Helps the flowers bloom</i>

850
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:23,947
<i>As the conch blows
And the fragrance spreads it's aura</i>

851
00:58:23,972 --> 00:58:27,328
<i>The dusk sky falls at your feet</i>

852
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:29,524
<i>As you murmured sweet nothings in my ears</i>

853
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:34,370
<i>Took me to you, my lovely girl
As I read the hints that you left</i>

854
00:58:34,395 --> 00:58:41,521
<i>Sleep eludes us and stays at bay
As the mast stands alone</i>

855
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:48,912
<i>I kept my promise, I came to you
And your presence drove away all the wrong</i>

856
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,321
<i>Jaya, a touch of your finger
Helps the flowers bloom</i>

857
00:58:56,346 --> 00:59:03,527
<i>Jaya, a touch of your finger
Helps the flowers bloom</i>

858
00:59:03,591 --> 00:59:10,854
<i>Jaya, a touch of your finger
Helps the flowers bloom</i>

859
00:59:10,928 --> 00:59:15,123
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

860
00:59:18,147 --> 00:59:22,226
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

861
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:26,753
<i>Jaya, you...</i>

862
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:40,407
Good morning!

863
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,081
Good morning.

864
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:45,510
Why did you call so early?

865
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:47,311
Let me give you some good news.

866
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,938
<i>The date for the World Championship
has been fixed.</i>

867
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,725
<i>Garry Basseils' manager
has confirmed the date.</i>

868
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,287
When?

869
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:55,573
Next week.

870
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:57,604
Cancel it.

871
00:59:58,755 --> 01:00:00,731
<i>Next week I have an
ad shoot in Switzerland.</i>

872
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:03,083
I've thought of honeymooning there.

873
01:00:03,746 --> 01:00:04,437
Sorry, Buro Da.

874
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:06,330
Shibaji...

875
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:07,658
<i>Cancel it.
Talk to you later.</i>

876
01:00:18,273 --> 01:00:19,565
Good afternoon.

877
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,199
Good afternoon.

878
01:00:29,317 --> 01:00:31,579
You skipped boxing
for an ad shoot?

879
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,936
You are giving up boxing
just for some little money?

880
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,134
What are you trying to say?

881
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,773
It's not just some money, Buro Da.

882
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:44,630
Millions.

883
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:48,625
Do you know how much
I pay each month for this flat?

884
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:52,494
I bought a Mercedes.
Booked an Audi for Jaya's birthday.

885
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,308
I need money.

886
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,297
I need a lot of money.

887
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:00,125
Money has consumed you.

888
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:04,239
It's the other way round.

889
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:10,321
Remember what Mr. Mitra had said when
you had asked him for 20,000 bucks?

890
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:11,850
"No one".

891
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:15,287
Our shoes wore out
in our effort to chase sponsors.

892
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,065
And that reporter Shantanu.

893
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:21,375
He used to bark at me
every time we met. But today...

894
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:24,295
He stands in queue
for my interview.

895
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:27,042
I have earned this, Buro Da.

896
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:31,188
The World Championship
will have to wait for me.

897
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:33,615
Before that ad shoots,
commercials, sponsors...

898
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,790
I need to earn a lot of money.

899
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:38,322
Jaya has cooked.

900
01:01:39,108 --> 01:01:41,160
Please stay for lunch, okay?

901
01:01:49,863 --> 01:01:51,071
Jaya!

902
01:01:52,218 --> 01:01:53,301
Jaya!

903
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:55,927
Hey!

904
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,577
Why are you doing all this?

905
01:01:57,746 --> 01:01:59,704
We have servants.

906
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:01,458
- Listen.
- Hmm.

907
01:02:03,964 --> 01:02:05,922
Make sure Buro Da eats well.

908
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:08,545
What did you tell him?

909
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:11,972
You won't fight the
World Championship match now?

910
01:02:11,997 --> 01:02:13,537
Millions are coming in.

911
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,639
If I don't do the ad shoots,
how will I expand my reach?

912
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,163
People have neglected you Shibaji

913
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:23,656
Respond to that...

914
01:02:24,042 --> 01:02:25,702
...by becoming the World Champion.

915
01:02:28,234 --> 01:02:31,376
Besides, I didn't marry Shibaji the model.

916
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:33,092
I think...

917
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:37,434
I married the boxer Shibaji.
The Champ!

918
01:02:37,464 --> 01:02:38,673
Isn't that so?

919
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,129
And what will I tell Mom?

920
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:47,042
Your son refused to fight
just for some money and his honeymoon?

921
01:02:47,247 --> 01:02:48,548
Not cool!

922
01:02:50,886 --> 01:02:52,064
Listen...

923
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,332
I don't want to go to
Switzerland for my honeymoon.

924
01:02:57,642 --> 01:02:58,967
For me...

925
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:01,563
...your boxing is much
more important!

926
01:03:01,822 --> 01:03:03,197
So please...

927
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:06,451
...I want to see you as
the World Champion!

928
01:03:07,614 --> 01:03:08,824
Please?

929
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:10,570
For me?

930
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:11,983
Come on!

931
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,450
Okay.

932
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:16,829
Yay!

933
01:03:18,133 --> 01:03:20,133
(commentary)

934
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,160
(commentary)

935
01:04:35,368 --> 01:04:37,490
What is he doing?!
Slow down! Slow down!

936
01:04:42,857 --> 01:04:46,180
Stop!
Move back.

937
01:04:47,461 --> 01:04:49,278
(commentary)

938
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:25,852
What's the hurry?

939
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,288
Go slow.

940
01:05:27,363 --> 01:05:28,423
Buro Da.

941
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:30,232
Don't talk too much.

942
01:05:30,257 --> 01:05:31,566
What are you saying?

943
01:05:31,622 --> 01:05:33,256
I'll knock him out
in the next round.

944
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:41,332
Box!

945
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,991
(commentary)

946
01:06:19,615 --> 01:06:20,694
One.

947
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,043
Two.

948
01:06:22,092 --> 01:06:23,234
Three.

949
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:24,845
Four.
Okay.

950
01:06:25,592 --> 01:06:26,750
Box.

951
01:06:27,242 --> 01:06:29,710
(commentary)

952
01:06:44,112 --> 01:06:45,737
Move up!

953
01:06:49,564 --> 01:06:51,303
I'm telling you once again...

954
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:53,628
You are playing a very open game.

955
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:56,056
Don't do that.

956
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,803
He'll take advantage.

957
01:06:58,487 --> 01:07:00,033
Remember this.

958
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,746
(commentary)

959
01:07:09,252 --> 01:07:10,460
Slow, slow!

960
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,395
(commentary)

961
01:07:50,684 --> 01:07:51,759
Shiba...

962
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,283
One.

963
01:07:53,308 --> 01:07:54,383
Two.

964
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:55,225
Three.

965
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:56,401
Four.

966
01:07:56,426 --> 01:07:57,496
Shibaji, get up.

967
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:58,712
Five.

968
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:00,259
Come on, get up...

969
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:03,743
Get up!

970
01:08:03,823 --> 01:08:05,434
(commentary)

971
01:08:17,908 --> 01:08:22,955
<i>And Shibaji Sanyal
has been declared the winner!</i>

972
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:25,749
<i>Shibaji Sanyal... What!</i>

973
01:08:26,026 --> 01:08:27,756
<i>Shibaji! He fell down!</i>

974
01:09:11,364 --> 01:09:13,931
Madam, we were all discussing.

975
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:17,183
- The extent of Shibaji's injury...
- Is Shibaji alive?

976
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:19,478
Actually, his skull
has been damaged.

977
01:09:19,503 --> 01:09:23,923
Two ribs have been cracked
and one lung has been punctured.

978
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:25,844
I feel bad to say it but...

979
01:09:26,003 --> 01:09:27,844
<i>He can never go back to boxing.</i>

980
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,184
<i>The Champ is finished.</i>

981
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,807
DEENKHAN PATRIKA
SAY GOODBYE TO THE INJURED SHIBAJI

982
01:10:00,204 --> 01:10:01,227
Wait.

983
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:03,777
I want to change.

984
01:10:06,943 --> 01:10:08,872
We'll get in to the car right now.

985
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:09,704
Jaya!

986
01:10:09,769 --> 01:10:11,937
My fans are waiting for me outside.

987
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:15,476
Mom, you think people will
want to see your Champ like this?

988
01:10:55,247 --> 01:10:57,753
You'll lose it in no time.
It's okay.

989
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:00,507
I'll get you your t-shirt.

990
01:11:06,766 --> 01:11:08,163
(all cheering) Shibaji! Shibaji!

991
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:34,058
No one knew that their Champ
will be released now. Right?

992
01:11:34,902 --> 01:11:37,804
That's why they may
have gone for lunch or...

993
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,455
Hey!

994
01:12:29,404 --> 01:12:30,476
Mom...

995
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:38,450
Shiba?

996
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:39,928
Shiba...

997
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,673
What's wrong, my dear?

998
01:12:58,726 --> 01:13:00,142
What does the doctor know?

999
01:13:00,403 --> 01:13:01,948
The doctor said...

1000
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:04,035
...that I can never step
in to a ring again?

1001
01:13:05,702 --> 01:13:07,375
My sweet boy...

1002
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:09,545
What you have done is a lot.

1003
01:13:10,604 --> 01:13:13,062
What more could a mother want?

1004
01:13:14,787 --> 01:13:18,795
You know, when I walk down the street...

1005
01:13:19,113 --> 01:13:20,898
People point at me and say...

1006
01:13:21,104 --> 01:13:23,125
"Look! That's Shiba's mother."

1007
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:24,750
Shiba's mother.

1008
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:27,501
I feel so proud of you.

1009
01:13:27,683 --> 01:13:29,500
- But Mom...
- What's the matter?

1010
01:13:29,682 --> 01:13:31,492
What are you mother
and son talking about?

1011
01:13:31,517 --> 01:13:32,755
Buro Da...

1012
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:34,825
Buro Da...

1013
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:36,675
Please make Mom understand.

1014
01:13:36,774 --> 01:13:38,865
That the doctors said I can't
do boxing anymore.

1015
01:13:39,058 --> 01:13:40,475
They know nothing about boxing.

1016
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,753
Do they even know what boxing is?

1017
01:13:41,778 --> 01:13:43,706
Will they decide my fate?

1018
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:45,539
I am fine!

1019
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:46,839
I am fit!

1020
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:48,015
Really!

1021
01:13:50,755 --> 01:13:52,340
What about the medicines?

1022
01:13:55,678 --> 01:13:57,470
You don't believe me?

1023
01:13:59,275 --> 01:14:00,400
Fine.

1024
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:03,212
I'll show you!

1025
01:14:03,446 --> 01:14:04,974
I'll show you that I'm fit.

1026
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,808
Shiba...

1027
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:18,633
- Shiba, don't do this.
- Come.

1028
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:20,236
I'll show you how fit I am.

1029
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:21,688
Come on!

1030
01:14:25,272 --> 01:14:26,664
Don't act crazy, Shiba!

1031
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:28,506
- I am fit!
- Don't do this.

1032
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:30,438
- Don't...
- See if I'm fit or not.

1033
01:14:30,463 --> 01:14:32,228
- Don't do it.
- Come on!

1034
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,225
Okay.
Let's do it.

1035
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,661
Shiba...

1036
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,979
Hey, Shiba!

1037
01:14:38,116 --> 01:14:39,544
- Where did you hurt yourself?
- Fit!

1038
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:41,148
- Shiba!
- I am fine.

1039
01:14:41,217 --> 01:14:42,790
- Do I look like...
- Shibaji, stop it!

1040
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,838
Enough is enough!

1041
01:14:46,068 --> 01:14:47,443
I can't take it anymore!

1042
01:14:47,677 --> 01:14:49,019
For one whole month...

1043
01:14:49,063 --> 01:14:52,725
...you had been fighting
death for a month.

1044
01:14:54,093 --> 01:14:56,672
Your ribs had broken
and punctured your lungs!

1045
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:58,330
And your mother...

1046
01:14:58,418 --> 01:15:01,640
She's had a minor heart attack
because of this!

1047
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:04,113
You want to see?
Buro Da show it to him!

1048
01:15:04,138 --> 01:15:06,027
Please see.
Show it to him!

1049
01:15:08,364 --> 01:15:09,503
Mom?

1050
01:15:10,476 --> 01:15:12,433
None of you told me?

1051
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,471
Who will tell you?
Who?

1052
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:16,559
Where were you?

1053
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:18,979
Where were you?!
You were in a coma!

1054
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:22,304
No one thought that you
would make it out alive.

1055
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:23,764
But we managed it.

1056
01:15:24,177 --> 01:15:25,976
We have managed to get you back.

1057
01:15:26,059 --> 01:15:27,716
But it is true...

1058
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:30,308
...that we have got you back
in exchange for boxing.

1059
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:32,094
Now you have to understand...

1060
01:15:32,184 --> 01:15:34,897
That if you go back to that ring, do it.

1061
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:37,083
But also know that
you are finished!

1062
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:39,266
- Jaya, my...
- One second!

1063
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:40,983
The word is not "finished", Shiba...

1064
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:42,259
...it's dead!

1065
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:45,371
Shibaji Sanyal, you will be dead!

1066
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:48,126
- Jaya...
- I don't want to hear a thing.

1067
01:15:49,452 --> 01:15:51,915
For heaven's sake, stay alive.

1068
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:53,542
And let us live in peace.

1069
01:15:53,638 --> 01:15:54,860
Please!

1070
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:59,803
Because without you,
we won't be able to survive.

1071
01:16:01,011 --> 01:16:03,183
- I don't want to live without you!
- Jaya...

1072
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,750
- I am fine, Jaya...
- Jaya!

1073
01:16:04,845 --> 01:16:05,819
Jaya...

1074
01:16:05,982 --> 01:16:07,493
- Don't get...
- Jaya...

1075
01:16:09,206 --> 01:16:10,264
Mom...

1076
01:16:10,297 --> 01:16:11,692
It's all my fault.

1077
01:16:12,533 --> 01:16:14,739
I got you into the boxing circuit.

1078
01:16:14,918 --> 01:16:16,210
But that's it.

1079
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,088
I'm leaving.

1080
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:21,176
Somewhere far away.

1081
01:16:39,758 --> 01:16:40,902
Philippe Croizon...

1082
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:42,758
Who doesn't have two limbs...

1083
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,084
He managed to swim across
the English Channel.

1084
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,258
Arunima Sinha...

1085
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:51,043
She has only one leg.

1086
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:53,472
She conquered Mount Everest.

1087
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:56,426
Why can't I do it?

1088
01:16:57,756 --> 01:16:58,956
My boy...

1089
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:01,202
Look.

1090
01:17:02,012 --> 01:17:03,543
Didn't you see that X-ray?

1091
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:05,471
Your rib has been fractured...

1092
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,375
...and is touching your lung.

1093
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:09,614
We may lose you at any moment.

1094
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,566
Your lungs can't
retain enough Oxygen.

1095
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:14,288
There is nothing more to do.

1096
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:15,883
The game is over.

1097
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:18,472
But I can't...

1098
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:21,380
...see my Champ like this.

1099
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:23,683
And so, I'm going.

1100
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,050
Far away.

1101
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:26,882
I've got a job at a tea estate.

1102
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:30,962
Buro Bagchi was
wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

1103
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:34,351
You can't win only with
passion and honesty.

1104
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,542
You need luck too.

1105
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,672
And I don't have luck on my side.

1106
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:43,632
But I never realised it.

1107
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,751
Bye.

1108
01:17:51,015 --> 01:17:52,349
Don't leave me.

1109
01:17:52,595 --> 01:17:53,980
Don't do this.

1110
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,218
I'm sorry.

1111
01:17:57,014 --> 01:17:58,764
I'm very sorry.

1112
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,458
But I have to go.

1113
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:03,429
If possible...

1114
01:18:04,302 --> 01:18:08,214
please forgive this worthless brother
of yours.

1115
01:18:09,478 --> 01:18:11,034
That's all I ask.

1116
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:14,478
Bloody fate!

1117
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:15,962
It's all fate...

1118
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:19,167
It's only fate! Bloody fate!

1119
01:18:22,924 --> 01:18:26,591
Why doesn't anyone believe that I'm okay?

1120
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,246
I am fit!

1121
01:18:46,053 --> 01:18:48,451
- That's Shibaji Sanyal.
- Who cares?

1122
01:18:58,492 --> 01:19:00,034
How are you, Shantanu?

1123
01:19:01,047 --> 01:19:02,755
Should I be doing badly?

1124
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,355
Just say what you have to.

1125
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,820
Did you need to write all this?

1126
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:10,124
What is it?

1127
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:11,408
Oh...

1128
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:12,865
"Say goodbye to the injured Shibaji."

1129
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:15,568
Our eyes have been trained, okay?

1130
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:18,116
We know who can make it...

1131
01:19:19,095 --> 01:19:20,345
And who can't...

1132
01:19:20,597 --> 01:19:21,917
We know it.

1133
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:24,750
What will you do now?
Get a job?

1134
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:25,850
No...

1135
01:19:25,906 --> 01:19:28,189
I'm thinking about
becoming a boxing coach.

1136
01:19:28,214 --> 01:19:29,235
Hmm?

1137
01:19:30,552 --> 01:19:31,846
You'll become a coach?

1138
01:19:32,044 --> 01:19:34,283
You aren't even a proper fighter
and now you want to be a coach?

1139
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:38,659
Thank you, Shantanu.

1140
01:19:40,454 --> 01:19:41,746
Thank you.

1141
01:19:42,608 --> 01:19:43,715
Hello...

1142
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,433
- How are you, sir?
- Hello, how are you?

1143
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:48,449
Hi!

1144
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:54,169
- Shantanu, doing well?
- How are you?

1145
01:19:54,993 --> 01:19:56,153
Hey, Shibaji!

1146
01:19:57,471 --> 01:19:59,391
Shibaji Sanyal.

1147
01:20:00,233 --> 01:20:01,525
So sad...

1148
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:04,874
The punch that punctured your
lungs is Gary's style!

1149
01:20:04,962 --> 01:20:06,993
If I get you in the ring...

1150
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,682
...I'll finish you.

1151
01:20:09,021 --> 01:20:11,146
- Do it.
- Oh really?

1152
01:20:12,872 --> 01:20:15,706
- Challenging me?
- Calm down.

1153
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:18,704
This is not a boxing ring.

1154
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,159
You can take a fish out of the water
but it will always swim...

1155
01:20:23,059 --> 01:20:24,684
You want a selfie with me?

1156
01:20:25,508 --> 01:20:27,133
Move aside!

1157
01:20:36,762 --> 01:20:39,800
Shibaji Sanyal had
risen from a dustbin.

1158
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,587
He is a boxer by breed, Shantanu!

1159
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:47,323
You know the rope-a - dope?

1160
01:20:48,294 --> 01:20:51,014
With a single punch,
Fate can pin you to the ropes.

1161
01:20:51,966 --> 01:20:53,315
But then again...

1162
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:57,886
One can hit back with six punches
to the jaws of Fate.

1163
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,771
I make a promise today, Shantanu.

1164
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:05,334
You will see me in the ring.

1165
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,379
Mark my words.

1166
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:16,767
Sorry, sorry, just a little more.

1167
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:18,015
A little more...

1168
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:19,475
It's nearly done.

1169
01:21:21,036 --> 01:21:23,420
I don't want to hear anymore
about boxing, Shiba.

1170
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:25,079
Haven't you had enough?

1171
01:21:25,488 --> 01:21:26,759
Please forget it.

1172
01:21:26,805 --> 01:21:28,934
We could do something else.

1173
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:30,751
But not boxing.

1174
01:21:30,898 --> 01:21:33,267
I need to get a
good doctor for Mom.

1175
01:21:38,778 --> 01:21:39,862
Give me my phone.

1176
01:21:39,933 --> 01:21:41,017
Now?

1177
01:21:41,042 --> 01:21:43,743
Who will you call
so late at night?

1178
01:21:50,145 --> 01:21:51,242
Hello, Pratim?

1179
01:21:51,847 --> 01:21:53,178
It's Shibaji...

1180
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:54,169
No...

1181
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,860
No, no, it's alright.

1182
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:00,256
I'll call you later.

1183
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:04,076
Your medicines.

1184
01:22:04,703 --> 01:22:06,616
- Medicines...
- One minute, please.

1185
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:17,774
Rahul, this is Shibaji.

1186
01:22:18,602 --> 01:22:19,894
No, no...

1187
01:22:20,374 --> 01:22:21,920
Much better than before.

1188
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:23,920
<i>Remember I had two ad shoots...</i>

1189
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:25,031
The one that...

1190
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:26,991
I'm really busy right now.

1191
01:22:27,016 --> 01:22:30,058
<i>I'll be busy in 10 days.
Won't get the time.</i>

1192
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,245
You know how it is.

1193
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:33,770
Training, World Championship and...

1194
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:37,500
Hello?

1195
01:22:38,545 --> 01:22:39,795
Rahul?

1196
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:42,705
Ra...

1197
01:22:44,503 --> 01:22:45,689
What happened?

1198
01:22:45,946 --> 01:22:47,363
Anything serious?

1199
01:22:48,437 --> 01:22:49,541
No, no...

1200
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:51,484
Nothing...

1201
01:22:51,509 --> 01:22:54,009
I need to tell you some...

1202
01:22:54,982 --> 01:22:56,115
So...

1203
01:23:03,306 --> 01:23:03,938
<i>You know...</i>

1204
01:23:03,962 --> 01:23:05,730
...who just called me?

1205
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:07,333
Boxer...

1206
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:10,952
Sorry, ex-boxer, Shibaji Sanyal.

1207
01:23:11,521 --> 01:23:13,312
He called me too.

1208
01:23:13,714 --> 01:23:16,133
What can he do?
He's out of work.

1209
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,558
A dead elephant is worth millions.

1210
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:21,558
A dead elephant is worth millions.

1211
01:23:21,959 --> 01:23:23,689
This is a dead boxer!

1212
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,118
Completely zero value!
Zero!

1213
01:23:26,467 --> 01:23:28,475
Someone explain it to him.

1214
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,030
Hey.

1215
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:32,333
What's wrong?

1216
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,664
You seem tense.

1217
01:23:34,752 --> 01:23:36,625
No, no...
It's nothing.

1218
01:23:36,839 --> 01:23:38,005
Sure?

1219
01:23:38,196 --> 01:23:39,196
Hmm.

1220
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:44,093
Listen...

1221
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:47,625
I have something to say to you.

1222
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,370
What?

1223
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,337
Guess!

1224
01:23:52,488 --> 01:23:55,100
How will I know, Jaya?

1225
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:56,591
Okay...

1226
01:23:57,841 --> 01:24:02,138
I had been to the doctor today.

1227
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,482
Really?

1228
01:24:07,618 --> 01:24:08,660
Yes!

1229
01:24:10,969 --> 01:24:12,132
Seriously?

1230
01:24:12,241 --> 01:24:14,033
Yes, I'm pregnant!

1231
01:24:16,668 --> 01:24:17,686
I am very happy!

1232
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:18,850
Okay, listen.

1233
01:24:19,246 --> 01:24:20,329
Choose.

1234
01:24:20,642 --> 01:24:21,817
What is this?

1235
01:24:21,842 --> 01:24:23,592
Choose! I'll tell you later.

1236
01:24:27,357 --> 01:24:28,453
Baby girl.

1237
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:29,834
Just like me!

1238
01:24:30,113 --> 01:24:31,946
She can have your eyes.

1239
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,089
Are you happy?

1240
01:24:35,499 --> 01:24:36,749
Are you?

1241
01:24:37,718 --> 01:24:39,093
Thank you, Jaya.

1242
01:24:46,043 --> 01:24:47,169
Yes, Brotin?

1243
01:24:49,435 --> 01:24:50,328
Tomorrow at 11 a.m.?

1244
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:53,391
Good morning!

1245
01:24:53,771 --> 01:24:56,216
- Hey, morning.
- Morning.

1246
01:24:57,915 --> 01:24:59,112
- So?
- You look fit.

1247
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:00,534
Yes! Always.

1248
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:01,659
What's the product?

1249
01:25:01,684 --> 01:25:03,010
Actually...

1250
01:25:03,073 --> 01:25:07,770
I can't endorse alcohol, cigarettes
and tobacco products. Okay?

1251
01:25:07,795 --> 01:25:10,343
- You don't need to do a thing.
- Nothing like that at all.

1252
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:14,142
The sponsors had given you a
lot of money in advance. Remember?

1253
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:17,477
For the World Championship
many companies had...

1254
01:25:17,564 --> 01:25:19,763
...invested a lot of money in you.

1255
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:21,990
- So?
- You need to return the money.

1256
01:25:24,392 --> 01:25:25,879
I need to return it?

1257
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:27,251
Why? Where is it written?

1258
01:25:27,276 --> 01:25:28,559
In the agreement.

1259
01:25:29,217 --> 01:25:30,716
There's a clause
here which states...

1260
01:25:30,741 --> 01:25:34,059
In case of any
unforeseen circumstances...

1261
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,305
You have to pay back everything.

1262
01:25:36,392 --> 01:25:37,596
All your advances.

1263
01:25:37,621 --> 01:25:42,249
I don't want the companies
to stand against you in court.

1264
01:25:42,732 --> 01:25:43,907
So...

1265
01:25:52,028 --> 01:25:53,319
How much money?

1266
01:25:53,905 --> 01:25:55,571
Near about Rs. 50 crores.

1267
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,677
What are you doing?

1268
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:34,609
Who are you all?

1269
01:26:35,009 --> 01:26:37,142
What are you doing?
Who are you?

1270
01:26:37,168 --> 01:26:39,136
- Who are they?
- Where are you taking...

1271
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:40,750
One second, Mom.

1272
01:26:40,919 --> 01:26:42,025
Shiba!

1273
01:26:42,128 --> 01:26:43,835
- Shiba!
- Who?

1274
01:26:44,558 --> 01:26:45,708
Shibaji?

1275
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:46,700
Who are they?

1276
01:26:46,786 --> 01:26:48,994
Where are they
taking away our stuff?

1277
01:26:49,477 --> 01:26:51,627
Excuse me! Put that down!

1278
01:26:51,652 --> 01:26:53,596
What is this, Shiba?

1279
01:26:53,636 --> 01:26:55,552
If anything breaks...

1280
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,366
Shibaji, I am talking to you!

1281
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:58,936
One second...
Excuse me!

1282
01:26:58,961 --> 01:27:01,205
Shibaji say something!
What is happening?

1283
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:03,309
Excuse me, where are you from...

1284
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,992
Let them be, Jaya.

1285
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:08,587
What do you mean?

1286
01:27:09,504 --> 01:27:11,243
Where are they
taking our things?

1287
01:27:13,879 --> 01:27:14,981
Son...

1288
01:27:16,424 --> 01:27:19,466
Why are they taking away our things?

1289
01:27:27,485 --> 01:27:30,235
A lot of companies
had invested in me.

1290
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:33,959
In the hope that I would win
the World Championship.

1291
01:27:34,512 --> 01:27:35,998
It was a lot of money.

1292
01:27:36,023 --> 01:27:37,273
And I...

1293
01:27:37,589 --> 01:27:39,214
And I took it all in advance.

1294
01:27:41,169 --> 01:27:43,086
But now the Champ is finished.

1295
01:27:43,278 --> 01:27:46,528
I can't even go near a
boxing ring anymore.

1296
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:50,770
So I have to give
the money back.

1297
01:27:51,902 --> 01:27:53,402
And I have no money.

1298
01:27:53,994 --> 01:27:56,077
That's why our things...

1299
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,042
Sir, please let this be.

1300
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,317
Shiba...

1301
01:28:23,936 --> 01:28:25,603
Don't let it break you.

1302
01:28:26,406 --> 01:28:28,391
We are with you.

1303
01:28:29,379 --> 01:28:33,462
We can start afresh.

1304
01:28:35,462 --> 01:28:37,587
Please don't break down.

1305
01:28:38,177 --> 01:28:39,506
Please, Shiba.

1306
01:28:58,540 --> 01:28:59,997
<i>Hello, Shibaji.</i>

1307
01:29:00,271 --> 01:29:01,600
<i>I'm calling from the bank.</i>

1308
01:29:01,863 --> 01:29:04,111
<i>Six of your cheques have bounced.</i>

1309
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,829
<i>We are forced to take
custody of your house.</i>

1310
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:09,406
<i>Please shift within seven days.</i>

1311
01:29:28,866 --> 01:29:30,033
- Mr. Shibaji.
- Yes?

1312
01:29:30,058 --> 01:29:31,502
Could you please come with me?

1313
01:29:33,025 --> 01:29:36,858
We have some basic formalities
and you need to sign.

1314
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:40,956
A cash deposit for bed number 865.

1315
01:29:42,707 --> 01:29:44,568
- Does your mother have mediclaim?
- Huh?

1316
01:29:44,593 --> 01:29:46,089
Does your mother have medical insurance?

1317
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:47,168
No.

1318
01:29:47,193 --> 01:29:50,167
Then deposit one lakh rupees here.

1319
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:53,230
One lakh?

1320
01:29:54,076 --> 01:29:55,675
Sir, I don't have any money now.

1321
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:57,040
You don't have money?

1322
01:29:57,127 --> 01:29:58,553
Then why have you come here?

1323
01:29:58,578 --> 01:29:59,925
Go to a government hospital.

1324
01:29:59,991 --> 01:30:00,988
Sir...

1325
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:05,314
Fast! Please!

1326
01:30:05,845 --> 01:30:07,970
Mom, it'll be okay.

1327
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:10,292
- Mom...
- Wait a second.

1328
01:30:10,407 --> 01:30:13,650
You go get the ticket
and I'll stay with her. Go!

1329
01:30:13,721 --> 01:30:15,681
- Mom...
- I'll take care of her. Let's go!

1330
01:30:15,706 --> 01:30:17,414
- It'll be okay...
- Go fast.

1331
01:30:18,728 --> 01:30:20,843
Sir...
A patient for the Operation Theatre.

1332
01:30:21,355 --> 01:30:23,567
- I need a doctor's ticket.
- Patient's name?

1333
01:30:23,629 --> 01:30:24,742
Gita Sanyal.

1334
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:27,440
Ticket.

1335
01:30:27,743 --> 01:30:29,146
Where's Mom?

1336
01:30:29,234 --> 01:30:31,035
They've taken her inside.

1337
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,670
Shiba, the doctor
has asked us not to go in.

1338
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:41,772
- Please calm down...
- Jaya!

1339
01:30:43,486 --> 01:30:44,986
Mom will be okay, right?

1340
01:30:45,097 --> 01:30:47,358
What are you saying?
Of course she'll be okay.

1341
01:30:47,383 --> 01:30:49,026
She's being taken care of.

1342
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:06,630
She had very little time.

1343
01:31:07,845 --> 01:31:10,032
Why did you roam around with her?

1344
01:31:10,553 --> 01:31:12,397
From one hospital to another?

1345
01:31:12,602 --> 01:31:14,556
She couldn't bear the strain.

1346
01:31:20,478 --> 01:31:21,380
Mom...

1347
01:31:21,405 --> 01:31:23,977
Your mother.
She is no more.

1348
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:02,085
<i>You can't even go to sleep
without your mother.</i>

1349
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:05,608
How will you sleep
when I'm gone?

1350
01:32:10,009 --> 01:32:11,842
Will you remember me?

1351
01:32:12,597 --> 01:32:14,962
- You won't forget me, will you?
- Mom!

1352
01:32:15,819 --> 01:32:17,569
Where will you go?

1353
01:32:20,242 --> 01:32:22,901
You can never leave me.

1354
01:32:34,204 --> 01:32:36,787
Please forgive me...

1355
01:32:38,196 --> 01:32:40,336
Forgive me...

1356
01:32:57,454 --> 01:32:58,517
Mom...

1357
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,086
- Shiba?
- Hmm?

1358
01:33:48,197 --> 01:33:50,641
Remember Protima?

1359
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:54,530
She has a food delivery business.

1360
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,545
So she was asking if I...

1361
01:33:57,982 --> 01:33:59,940
...would like to join her.

1362
01:34:00,535 --> 01:34:02,591
What do you think?

1363
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,242
Easy...

1364
01:34:04,626 --> 01:34:07,527
Our family situation right now...

1365
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:10,398
And the rent...

1366
01:34:10,513 --> 01:34:12,753
- So I was wondering...
- Go back.

1367
01:34:12,778 --> 01:34:14,065
What?

1368
01:34:15,368 --> 01:34:17,382
Go back to your father.

1369
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:20,176
- Shiba...
- What have I given you?

1370
01:34:21,373 --> 01:34:23,708
You have grown up in luxury.

1371
01:34:24,906 --> 01:34:26,153
And I...

1372
01:34:27,684 --> 01:34:30,526
And I couldn't even
save my mother!

1373
01:34:30,551 --> 01:34:31,771
Shiba...

1374
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:35,057
If I had given the money in time
my mother would be alive.

1375
01:34:35,271 --> 01:34:38,405
No, no, no.
What are you saying?

1376
01:34:39,366 --> 01:34:41,808
Do you even know
what you're saying?

1377
01:34:41,888 --> 01:34:43,639
It doesn't befit you.

1378
01:34:43,664 --> 01:34:46,770
How are you to blame
for what happened?

1379
01:34:47,419 --> 01:34:51,936
Shiba, I left everything for you.

1380
01:34:52,905 --> 01:34:54,447
I am yours.

1381
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:56,183
And this child...

1382
01:34:56,327 --> 01:34:57,952
It's ours.

1383
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:05,515
No matter in what condition,
I will only be happy with you.

1384
01:35:06,228 --> 01:35:08,561
I'm very happy, Shiba!

1385
01:35:26,169 --> 01:35:31,956
<i>This broken sadness
Suddenly crowds around</i>

1386
01:35:33,059 --> 01:35:38,924
<i>And the lonely tears
Accompany it</i>

1387
01:35:46,815 --> 01:35:52,671
<i>This broken sadness
Suddenly crowds around</i>

1388
01:35:53,593 --> 01:35:59,664
<i>And the lonely tears
Accompany it</i>

1389
01:35:59,933 --> 01:36:03,131
<i>Who leaves me?</i>

1390
01:36:03,417 --> 01:36:06,552
<i>What do they say?</i>

1391
01:36:06,784 --> 01:36:13,451
<i>And all who return
Are but a dream</i>

1392
01:36:13,721 --> 01:36:17,276

01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:15,944
<i>Its windows shall be closed</i>

1402
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:18,260
<i>Darkness</i>

1403
01:37:18,786 --> 01:37:21,994
<i>There is no light</i>

1404
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:26,030
<i>Where will I find that life?</i>

1405
01:37:26,229 --> 01:37:29,601
<i>With loved ones I have lost</i>

1406
01:37:29,705 --> 01:37:35,608
<i>This life is not good.</i>

1407
01:37:36,561 --> 01:37:39,203
<i>These tears reached you by mistake</i>

1408
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:40,600
Dad!

1409
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:42,985

<i>My Maula...</i>

1438
01:40:20,754 --> 01:40:22,129
Excuse me?

1439
01:40:27,993 --> 01:40:29,243
Excuse me?

1440
01:40:32,513 --> 01:40:34,652
If you don't mind...
Could you please push my car?

1441
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:38,888
- What's wrong?
- It's not starting.

1442
01:40:39,542 --> 01:40:40,940
Could you please help push it?

1443
01:41:08,137 --> 01:41:09,462
Here. Start the car.

1444
01:41:09,527 --> 01:41:10,788
It's fixed?

1445
01:41:56,746 --> 01:41:57,832
BROTHER

1446
01:42:18,129 --> 01:42:19,212
Jaya?

1447
01:42:20,864 --> 01:42:22,698
- Jaya?
- Coming!

1448
01:42:27,482 --> 01:42:31,208
You're completely drenched!
You could've taken shelter somewhere.

1449
01:42:32,766 --> 01:42:34,593
Why did you let yourself get drenched?

1450
01:42:34,775 --> 01:42:36,062
You'll catch a cold.

1451
01:42:36,087 --> 01:42:38,299
- You have many restrictions, Shiba.
- Jaya...

1452
01:42:40,471 --> 01:42:42,971
Our factory has been
locked out from today.

1453
01:42:44,974 --> 01:42:48,599
I don't know when
I'll get this month's salary.

1454
01:42:51,884 --> 01:42:53,426
Have you eaten?

1455
01:42:53,636 --> 01:42:55,053
No... Yes...

1456
01:42:56,388 --> 01:42:58,680
- I ate out.
- Oh, okay.

1457
01:42:59,734 --> 01:43:01,259
How is your health?

1458
01:43:02,369 --> 01:43:03,750
- Fine...
- Have you eaten?

1459
01:43:03,798 --> 01:43:07,083
Yeah, I'm full...

1460
01:43:07,238 --> 01:43:09,869
Wait, I'll get something for you.

1461
01:43:53,458 --> 01:43:54,517
Shiv...

1462
01:43:57,083 --> 01:43:58,398
Shiba!

1463
01:44:03,707 --> 01:44:05,167
Shiba!

1464
01:44:07,071 --> 01:44:08,366
Jaya?

1465
01:44:08,892 --> 01:44:11,064
- What's wrong?
- Hospital...

1466
01:44:11,976 --> 01:44:13,402
I'm right here.
Don't worry.

1467
01:44:13,715 --> 01:44:15,010
Fast! Please!

1468
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:17,415
Everything will be fine.

1469
01:44:19,892 --> 01:44:21,783
Jaya Sanyal's family?

1470
01:44:21,808 --> 01:44:23,109
- That's me.
- You are?

1471
01:44:23,134 --> 01:44:24,658
I am Jaya's husband.

1472
01:44:24,714 --> 01:44:26,355
Admission is Rs. 60,000.

1473
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:28,158
Cabin charge is
Rs. 3000 per day.

1474
01:44:28,222 --> 01:44:30,291
Please clear the bills
on a daily basis.

1475
01:44:37,293 --> 01:44:37,995
<i>The labourers' demands...</i>

1476
01:44:38,019 --> 01:44:39,530
...must be met!

1477
01:44:39,555 --> 01:44:41,015
Must be met!

1478
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,388
The labourers demands'
must be met!

1479
01:44:43,413 --> 01:44:45,333
Must be met!

1480
01:44:46,055 --> 01:44:47,571
Shibaji, why so late?

1481
01:44:47,596 --> 01:44:49,897
- What is this?
- We labourers are on strike.

1482
01:44:51,095 --> 01:44:52,126
When will the factory reopen?

1483
01:44:52,151 --> 01:44:55,134
When the owners
meet our demands.

1484
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:56,634
How long will they
take advantage of us?

1485
01:44:56,659 --> 01:44:58,522
- No...
- Join our procession.

1486
01:44:58,547 --> 01:45:01,125
No, no. Has the man
with the cash come?

1487
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:02,942
Jaya has been admitted
to the hospital.

1488
01:45:03,514 --> 01:45:05,399
The doctor has asked for
Rs. 60,000 immediately.

1489
01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:07,049
Rs. 60,000!

1490
01:45:07,808 --> 01:45:09,311
Yes, I mean...

1491
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:11,160
If I got this month's salary...

1492
01:45:11,185 --> 01:45:15,858
If they don't reopen,
we can get nothing.

1493
01:45:16,271 --> 01:45:18,794
Instead of wasting time here,
try somewhere else.

1494
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:21,064
The labourers' demands
must be met!

1495
01:45:21,089 --> 01:45:22,652
Must be met!

1496
01:45:22,676 --> 01:45:25,033
(protesting)

1497
01:45:33,964 --> 01:45:35,681
WORKERS' STRIKE AGAINST LOW WAGES
ALL INDIA WORKERS UNION

1498
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,075
(indistinct chatter)

1499
01:46:00,412 --> 01:46:01,704
Why is he here?

1500
01:46:02,359 --> 01:46:04,784
- Did the club invite him?
- You think so?

1501
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:07,957
What is he doing here?

1502
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:09,902
Jaya is pregnant.

1503
01:46:10,659 --> 01:46:12,409
She's admitted to the hospital.

1504
01:46:14,003 --> 01:46:15,640
I need Rs. 60,000.

1505
01:46:17,732 --> 01:46:19,316
But I have nothing.

1506
01:46:19,895 --> 01:46:22,811
That's why I am standing
before you all.

1507
01:46:23,815 --> 01:46:28,703
There was a time when I spent
blood and sweat to make you happy.

1508
01:46:30,677 --> 01:46:32,782
But today, I am nothing.

1509
01:46:34,589 --> 01:46:37,047
That's why I have no one with me.

1510
01:46:38,826 --> 01:46:41,035
I haven't come for your pity.

1511
01:46:41,377 --> 01:46:45,711
I know that I am
no longer needed.

1512
01:46:45,736 --> 01:46:47,694
But it's also true...

1513
01:46:49,292 --> 01:46:51,667
...that if you do not
help me today...

1514
01:46:54,255 --> 01:46:58,431
I will not be able to save
my wife and child.

1515
01:47:01,121 --> 01:47:04,329
So, Rs. 60,000...

1516
01:47:15,377 --> 01:47:19,335
Please do not consider
this to be begging.

1517
01:48:18,614 --> 01:48:21,114
Sorry, I don't have change.

1518
01:48:21,605 --> 01:48:22,961
Please give him 10 bucks
on my behalf.

1519
01:48:22,986 --> 01:48:25,273
Let it be.
You don't have to give.

1520
01:49:07,565 --> 01:49:08,815
Hey, Shibaji.

1521
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:11,880
One minute.

1522
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:19,182
Is your wife admitted?

1523
01:49:23,201 --> 01:49:24,993
The bidding is over
for tonight's match.

1524
01:49:25,379 --> 01:49:26,523
But...

1525
01:49:27,222 --> 01:49:30,451
one of the fighters
had a bike accident.

1526
01:49:31,512 --> 01:49:33,387
Rs. 60,000 cash.

1527
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:35,506
Will you fight?

1528
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:38,962
- Boxing?
- Hmm.

1529
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:40,704
Are you joking?

1530
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,178
Out of practice...

1531
01:49:44,169 --> 01:49:45,597
I might not even win.

1532
01:49:48,125 --> 01:49:51,292
I know that you won't win!

1533
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:54,629
But you are losing to life.

1534
01:49:54,724 --> 01:49:56,914
At least, do something
for your wife and child.

1535
01:49:57,436 --> 01:49:58,612
So?

1536
01:50:02,271 --> 01:50:03,855
Will the money reach her?

1537
01:50:06,052 --> 01:50:08,437
Get knocked out
in the fourth round.

1538
01:50:08,781 --> 01:50:11,128
I will take the cash
to the hospital. Okay?

1539
01:50:11,597 --> 01:50:12,683
Oh!

1540
01:50:14,019 --> 01:50:15,627
Your opponent is...

1541
01:50:25,575 --> 01:50:27,075
All okay?

1542
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:29,444
Don't worry.
In the fourth round...

1543
01:50:29,594 --> 01:50:31,784
...take a punch from Prashant Singh
and fall over.

1544
01:50:31,901 --> 01:50:34,442
- The money?
- I will get you the money!

1545
01:50:35,932 --> 01:50:38,198
(all cheering) Prashant! Prashant!

1546
01:50:53,163 --> 01:50:56,900
<i>Prashant Singh and Shibaji Sanyal
face off one again.</i>

1547
01:50:56,948 --> 01:50:59,284
<i>The crowds are cheering for Singh...</i>

1548
01:50:59,308 --> 01:51:03,216
<i>because Shibaji Sanyal is no longer
a name in the boxing circuit.</i>

1549
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,812
My friends!

1550
01:51:08,376 --> 01:51:11,209
Has he been recovered
from the graveyard?

1551
01:51:14,081 --> 01:51:16,470
What happens when the fox wants to die?

1552
01:51:18,069 --> 01:51:20,057
He comes to Prashant Singh.

1553
01:51:21,347 --> 01:51:22,363
Second round.

1554
01:51:22,387 --> 01:51:23,933
<i>Singh is moving much faster.</i>

1555
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:26,537
<i>I don't know why
Sanyal attempted to box again.</i>

1556
01:51:29,824 --> 01:51:32,792
<i>Prashant left hook.
Again! Right hook!</i>

1557
01:51:32,816 --> 01:51:34,879
<i>And Shibaji Sanyal knocked down.</i>

1558
01:51:39,585 --> 01:51:45,207
<i>How an out-of-touch boxer
entered the ring to face Prashant Singh...</i>

1559
01:51:45,231 --> 01:51:46,294
<i>I simply just don't know.</i>

1560
01:51:53,523 --> 01:51:58,405
<i>Prashant's raining punches.
Shibaji Sanyal can barely keep standing.</i>

1561
01:51:58,429 --> 01:52:01,044
<i>We don't know how this fight will end.</i>

1562
01:52:01,727 --> 01:52:05,875
<i>Prashant is deadly with
his left hook-right hook combination.</i>

1563
01:52:05,987 --> 01:52:08,502
<i>Shibaji cannot hold his own.</i>

1564
01:52:30,337 --> 01:52:32,107
- Has the money reached?
- What?

1565
01:52:32,132 --> 01:52:34,244
- The money?
- I will send it! Now lose!

1566
01:52:34,269 --> 01:52:35,365
Come on!

1567
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:40,575
Welcome back, Shiba.

1568
01:52:43,083 --> 01:52:44,625
You're losing to him?

1569
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:46,386
To him?

1570
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:49,398
You're the Champ.
One upper cut right here!

1571
01:52:49,755 --> 01:52:51,446
- Knock out.
- Buro Da...

1572
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:53,863
I haven't come here to win.

1573
01:52:54,436 --> 01:52:56,667
- I have come to lose.
- What do you mean?

1574
01:52:56,982 --> 01:52:59,773
Jaya's pregnant and I need
Rs. 60,000 for the delivery.

1575
01:53:00,364 --> 01:53:02,428
Khoka will give me the money.

1576
01:53:03,503 --> 01:53:05,461
Please forgive me, Buro Da...

1577
01:53:06,503 --> 01:53:08,044
...for the last time.

1578
01:53:08,748 --> 01:53:10,641
I need to fight for my child.

1579
01:53:10,727 --> 01:53:12,519
But you are a champion.

1580
01:53:12,966 --> 01:53:14,427
The Champ never loses.

1581
01:53:16,547 --> 01:53:18,075
I was the Champ.

1582
01:53:18,867 --> 01:53:21,867
But now I am a
husband and a father.

1583
01:53:22,647 --> 01:53:24,131
Not your Champ.

1584
01:53:28,432 --> 01:53:31,213
<i>Prashant has cornered Shibaji...</i>

1585
01:53:31,238 --> 01:53:32,757
Upper cut! Bloody upper cut!

1586
01:53:32,877 --> 01:53:33,781
<i>Shibaji on the rope!</i>

1587
01:53:33,805 --> 01:53:35,805
Stop! Leave the rope!

1588
01:53:36,061 --> 01:53:37,170
Shiba!

1589
01:53:43,512 --> 01:53:47,282
<i>Singh punches again.
Shibaji knocked down!</i>

1590
01:53:48,710 --> 01:53:49,750
Get up!

1591
01:53:49,775 --> 01:53:51,744
He has come to lose!

1592
01:53:51,769 --> 01:53:54,398
Bloody bugger!
The Champ never loses.

1593
01:53:54,616 --> 01:53:56,025
The Champ only wins!

1594
01:53:57,525 --> 01:53:58,652
Hit him!

1595
01:54:00,711 --> 01:54:01,972
Shibaji Sanyal.

1596
01:54:02,248 --> 01:54:03,790
Bury him in the ring.

1597
01:54:05,809 --> 01:54:07,017
I'm telling you!

1598
01:54:10,313 --> 01:54:12,257
Buro Bagchi is telling you.
Now hit him!

1599
01:54:13,458 --> 01:54:14,666
Hit!

1600
01:54:17,374 --> 01:54:18,415
No!

1601
01:54:20,264 --> 01:54:21,446
<i>Singh is getting punched relentlessly.</i>

1602
01:54:21,471 --> 01:54:22,471
Stop!

1603
01:54:22,511 --> 01:54:23,772
<i>And there goes the bell.</i>

1604
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:29,113
Hey! You are Shibaji, huh?
The Champ, right?

1605
01:54:29,732 --> 01:54:31,767
I'll show you what Prashant Singh is.

1606
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:34,612
I will bury you!

1607
01:54:34,676 --> 01:54:36,922
- Hey you bloody bugger!
- Not so loud!

1608
01:54:36,947 --> 01:54:38,271
Just shove it!

1609
01:54:38,296 --> 01:54:40,787
Shiba, I will give you the money.

1610
01:54:41,257 --> 01:54:43,413
That idiot has learned
boxing from you.

1611
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:47,008
Show him who's boss!

1612
01:54:47,226 --> 01:54:48,858
Beat the hell out of him!

1613
01:54:48,971 --> 01:54:50,579
Shiba is Shiba!

1614
01:54:50,862 --> 01:54:52,207
Get him!

1615
01:54:52,564 --> 01:54:55,263
<i>Shibaji sanyal is aggressive.
Singh is aggressive too!</i>

1616
01:55:00,842 --> 01:55:03,468
<i>Both are fighting to death!</i>

1617
01:55:10,635 --> 01:55:13,864
<i>Again, Singh...
The referee broke them free.</i>

1618
01:55:20,410 --> 01:55:22,543
<i>Both looking for an advantage...</i>

1619
01:55:38,855 --> 01:55:40,950
Shiba!

1620
01:55:48,308 --> 01:55:51,941
<i>Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

1621
01:55:53,986 --> 01:55:54,603
Five...

1622
01:55:54,628 --> 01:55:56,925
- Six... seven...
- You won't get a single penny!

1623
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:59,422
Eight... Nine... Ten.

1624
01:55:59,462 --> 01:56:01,882
<i>(all cheering) Shibaji! Shibaji! Shibaji!</i>

1625
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:03,500
Yes!

1626
01:56:03,805 --> 01:56:05,606
Jaya Sanyal's family?

1627
01:56:11,125 --> 01:56:12,701
Are you from Jaya Sanyal's family?

1628
01:56:12,939 --> 01:56:14,026
Yes.

1629
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:17,185
Rs. 72,000.

1630
01:56:28,966 --> 01:56:30,390
I won't go in.

1631
01:56:31,069 --> 01:56:33,183
Please give this to the baby.

1632
01:56:33,311 --> 01:56:34,545
And say...

1633
01:56:35,444 --> 01:56:37,172
...it's from another mother.

1634
01:56:41,158 --> 01:56:42,307
The bill?

1635
01:56:45,164 --> 01:56:46,925
Give that to Shibaji.

1636
01:56:47,224 --> 01:56:48,449
Thank you.

1637
01:57:19,292 --> 01:57:21,736
- The two of us...
- Hush!

1638
01:57:25,546 --> 01:57:27,146
Crossing the road...

1639
01:57:28,371 --> 01:57:29,730
When a bull...

1640
01:57:31,452 --> 01:57:32,650
...attacked.

1641
01:57:43,893 --> 01:57:45,083
Careful.

1642
01:57:54,395 --> 01:57:56,269
It's like Mom is back, Buro Da.

1643
01:58:09,969 --> 01:58:11,168
So...

1644
01:58:11,894 --> 01:58:13,519
What do we name her?

1645
01:58:14,128 --> 01:58:16,072
- I was thinking...
- Sathi.

1646
01:58:19,352 --> 01:58:20,644
Her name will be...

1647
01:58:22,076 --> 01:58:23,276
Sathi.

1648
01:58:23,575 --> 01:58:24,712
Sathi...

1649
01:58:36,765 --> 01:58:37,783
Hey!

1650
01:58:38,185 --> 01:58:41,592
What are you two
reading so intently?

1651
01:58:45,690 --> 01:58:46,857
Let me see...

1652
01:58:47,409 --> 01:58:49,131
"The Champ is back."

1653
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,742
Whose idea was this?

1654
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:55,622
What if your rib cage broke again?

1655
01:58:55,796 --> 01:58:58,693
You were boxing
while I was at the hospital?

1656
01:58:58,789 --> 01:59:02,622
I swear I only did it to pay the bill.

1657
01:59:02,868 --> 01:59:04,875
But nothing happened to me.
See!

1658
01:59:05,177 --> 01:59:07,169
- Oh, nothing happened?
- No.

1659
01:59:07,208 --> 01:59:08,637
What about these scars?

1660
01:59:09,411 --> 01:59:11,026
- These scars?
- Yes!

1661
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:13,512
- It was a goat.
- No, a bull.

1662
01:59:14,331 --> 01:59:15,417
- A bull.
- Oh.

1663
01:59:15,442 --> 01:59:17,926
- That bull again? I see.
- Yes, the same old bull.

1664
01:59:17,956 --> 01:59:20,767
The bull was on the road.
He went near it and...

1665
01:59:20,822 --> 01:59:22,330
- Got hit.
- Yes.

1666
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:24,383
It's a cock and bull story!

1667
01:59:24,408 --> 01:59:25,798
What is this?

1668
01:59:26,377 --> 01:59:27,175
Buro Da?

1669
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,116
Shiba, I'm telling you...
Shiba?

1670
01:59:29,746 --> 01:59:31,357
Shiba?
Shiba!

1671
01:59:31,786 --> 01:59:32,857
Breathe.

1672
01:59:34,985 --> 01:59:36,119
Okay.

1673
01:59:37,151 --> 01:59:38,770
You may get up.

1674
01:59:39,024 --> 01:59:40,237
Carefully.

1675
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:46,530
(Announcement on PA system)

1676
01:59:57,361 --> 01:59:58,660
- Sit down.
- Amazing.

1677
01:59:58,884 --> 02:00:00,342
It's completely healed.

1678
02:00:00,722 --> 02:00:02,144
- He says it's healed.
- Yes.

1679
02:00:03,417 --> 02:00:09,004
- But two areas still need to heal.
- Where?

1680
02:00:09,139 --> 02:00:10,443
Third and fourth.

1681
02:00:10,739 --> 02:00:12,015
Vital spots.

1682
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:14,041
Near very vital organs...

1683
02:00:14,176 --> 02:00:15,214
- One minute!
- Heart...

1684
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:17,381
You just said it's amazing
and completely healed?

1685
02:00:17,406 --> 02:00:19,152
It's almost healed...

1686
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:23,357
I mean if it breaks
then it may be a problem.

1687
02:00:23,397 --> 02:00:27,084
Do some breathing exercises
for faster healing.

1688
02:00:27,109 --> 02:00:29,088
I'll show you.

1689
02:00:37,609 --> 02:00:38,943
Will I be able to box?

1690
02:00:40,714 --> 02:00:42,297
- Boxing?
- Yes.

1691
02:00:42,928 --> 02:00:44,064
Is he crazy?

1692
02:00:45,061 --> 02:00:46,682
He says it all the time.

1693
02:00:46,902 --> 02:00:48,568
I want to box...

1694
02:00:49,153 --> 02:00:51,528
How will you box?

1695
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:52,865
Let's go.

1696
02:00:53,467 --> 02:00:54,884
Let's go sing devotional songs.

1697
02:00:55,204 --> 02:00:57,061
You can't say no.

1698
02:00:57,291 --> 02:00:58,585
When he sings...

1699
02:00:58,647 --> 02:01:01,251
...I'll send you a pass.
Please go and watch.

1700
02:01:01,291 --> 02:01:02,601
Free pass!

1701
02:01:02,736 --> 02:01:06,792
(singing)

1702
02:01:11,182 --> 02:01:12,520
The heart of a lion...

1703
02:01:12,573 --> 02:01:14,520
...and the ribs of a chicken.

1704
02:01:14,817 --> 02:01:18,202
If you could just seal it with cement.

1705
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:19,647
Absolutely!

1706
02:01:20,029 --> 02:01:21,595
Seal it somehow!

1707
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:24,849
Do something!

1708
02:01:24,972 --> 02:01:26,349
Not possible...

1709
02:01:26,738 --> 02:01:27,999
Buro Da...

1710
02:01:28,494 --> 02:01:30,119
How many bones are there
in the human body?

1711
02:01:30,230 --> 02:01:32,855
Something around 206.

1712
02:01:34,302 --> 02:01:35,719
- Two hundred and six?
- Yes.

1713
02:01:35,855 --> 02:01:38,316
That means 204 are still okay.

1714
02:01:39,873 --> 02:01:41,039
I am fit, Buro Da.

1715
02:01:41,277 --> 02:01:42,485
Fit?

1716
02:01:42,659 --> 02:01:45,482
- Yes. Don't you believe me?
- No.

1717
02:01:45,733 --> 02:01:46,808
Hey...

1718
02:01:47,686 --> 02:01:49,696
Get up! Stop the drama.

1719
02:01:50,677 --> 02:01:51,823
- Buro Da.
- Yes?

1720
02:01:51,904 --> 02:01:53,537
Just convince Jaya.

1721
02:01:54,333 --> 02:01:55,907
I can do it!
I beg you...

1722
02:01:55,932 --> 02:01:57,917
Not again! Get up!

1723
02:01:58,046 --> 02:01:59,338
Get up!

1724
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,424
<i>What happened to you?</i>

1725
02:02:03,042 --> 02:02:05,725
We stay together.
In close quarters.

1726
02:02:05,781 --> 02:02:07,446
So am just checking.

1727
02:02:08,468 --> 02:02:09,692
Maybe it's contagious.

1728
02:02:10,526 --> 02:02:12,401
It's not contagious.

1729
02:02:12,426 --> 02:02:15,640
Please put your hands
to the side.

1730
02:02:15,736 --> 02:02:19,204
- And take a deep breath when I tell you.
- Okay.

1731
02:02:19,996 --> 02:02:21,726
- Now.
- Should I breathe?

1732
02:02:21,779 --> 02:02:23,694
Take a deep breath.

1733
02:02:24,385 --> 02:02:25,417
Yes.

1734
02:02:25,544 --> 02:02:26,639
It's done.

1735
02:02:27,297 --> 02:02:28,734
Completely healed?

1736
02:02:32,954 --> 02:02:35,123
Let's see what the reports say.

1737
02:02:41,363 --> 02:02:43,363
Dr.Sen said you can box?

1738
02:02:44,235 --> 02:02:45,731
That's what he wrote.

1739
02:02:46,809 --> 02:02:48,219
Are you telling the truth?

1740
02:02:48,417 --> 02:02:51,833
- You could call him...
- No, no. It's not that...

1741
02:02:52,507 --> 02:02:53,507
Healed?

1742
02:02:53,547 --> 02:02:56,070
The World Pro Boxing
Championship is in two months.

1743
02:02:56,212 --> 02:02:57,337
So?

1744
02:02:59,725 --> 02:03:00,975
Can I participate?

1745
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:02,618
With this body?

1746
02:03:02,975 --> 02:03:04,534
I'll lose the calories in no time.

1747
02:03:05,408 --> 02:03:06,630
You had said so.

1748
02:03:07,465 --> 02:03:08,519
Yes...

1749
02:03:10,947 --> 02:03:12,344
All the best.

1750
02:03:12,472 --> 02:03:13,975
If you say it like that, I won't go.

1751
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,587
- Yeah, I won't go.
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

1752
02:03:16,635 --> 02:03:18,801
Yes, all the best!

1753
02:03:19,881 --> 02:03:21,006
Really?

1754
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:24,288
Okay, I believe you.

1755
02:03:25,037 --> 02:03:26,153
Thank you.

1756
02:03:27,224 --> 02:03:29,100
- I love you.
- Be careful.

1757

Evan Terryjobs.

1789
02:05:30,562 --> 02:05:32,179
American boxer.

1790
02:05:32,819 --> 02:05:35,846
The very thought of
him makes me shiver!

1791
02:05:36,457 --> 02:05:38,576
So I was thinking...

1792
02:05:38,814 --> 02:05:42,282
...we should visit Dr.Sen
before the World Championships.

1793
02:05:42,575 --> 02:05:46,266
But the doctor has cleared him for boxing.

1794
02:05:46,638 --> 02:05:50,043
Just a precautionary measure.
It will give me peace...

1795
02:05:50,068 --> 02:05:51,511
- What happened?
- There, you've done it.

1796
02:05:51,559 --> 02:05:53,333
- Nothing.
- What happened?

1797
02:05:53,638 --> 02:05:54,683
Shiba?

1798
02:05:54,921 --> 02:05:55,987
You okay?

1799
02:06:54,594 --> 02:06:55,999
How are you, Jaya?

1800
02:06:57,021 --> 02:06:58,420
You...

1801
02:06:58,589 --> 02:07:00,798
Please come in.

1802
02:07:01,854 --> 02:07:04,646
I thought I'd drop by for tea.

1803
02:07:05,173 --> 02:07:06,839
- Could I get some tea?
- What?

1804
02:07:07,125 --> 02:07:08,942
- Tea.
- Yes, of course.

1805
02:07:12,188 --> 02:07:13,521
What's the need?

1806
02:07:14,563 --> 02:07:18,544
The World Championships
in this condition?

1807
02:07:19,394 --> 02:07:21,061
What if you die?

1808
02:07:21,411 --> 02:07:22,911
It'll be disastrous!

1809
02:07:26,077 --> 02:07:27,369
Shantanu...

1810
02:07:27,877 --> 02:07:30,210
You just can't stand my success, can you?

1811
02:07:31,042 --> 02:07:32,432
What do you think?

1812
02:07:32,826 --> 02:07:34,600
You think Evan Terryjobs...

1813
02:07:34,678 --> 02:07:36,344
...will just suck it up in the ring?

1814
02:07:36,417 --> 02:07:38,654
Think he'll let you punch him six times...

1815
02:07:38,712 --> 02:07:41,295
...and send you dancing home
with Buro Da?

1816
02:07:44,512 --> 02:07:46,096
Do you know who he is?

1817
02:07:47,798 --> 02:07:49,479
Ever seen him fight?

1818
02:07:51,292 --> 02:07:56,605
He has killed eight boxers
in the ring last year,

1819
02:07:56,733 --> 02:07:58,296
He enters the ring to murder.

1820
02:07:58,402 --> 02:07:59,860
Do you have any idea about him?

1821
02:08:04,353 --> 02:08:06,603
I don't think your coach has
seen him fight either.

1822
02:08:08,678 --> 02:08:10,220
Keep this DVD.

1823
02:08:10,577 --> 02:08:15,494
This has many of his fights.

1824
02:08:15,771 --> 02:08:18,313
Study his technique.
It might help.

1825
02:08:18,844 --> 02:08:20,136
Take it.

1826
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:25,845
I am not saying this
will help you in the fight.

1827
02:08:26,542 --> 02:08:29,500
But if you do survive...

1828
02:08:30,125 --> 02:08:31,875
then my headlines will read...

1829
02:08:32,917 --> 02:08:35,397
"Shibaji Sanyal!
World Champ!"

1830
02:08:37,962 --> 02:08:39,591
- Good night.
- Here's your...

1831
02:08:40,306 --> 02:08:41,472
Your tea...

1832
02:08:47,013 --> 02:08:48,234
Go to bed.

1833
02:09:22,136 --> 02:09:22,561
<i>How many...</i>

1834
02:09:22,585 --> 02:09:24,125
...bulbs will you break?

1835
02:10:13,933 --> 02:10:16,219
My son can't even
go to sleep without me.

1836
02:10:17,755 --> 02:10:19,616
<i>I'm not well, Mom.</i>

1837
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:23,693
<i>My life's dream lies before me...</i>

1838
02:10:24,033 --> 02:10:26,324
<i>The World Championship match.</i>

1839
02:10:26,641 --> 02:10:28,862
<i>Why am I becoming so weak?</i>

1840
02:10:31,357 --> 02:10:34,107
<i>Why does it seem like
I'm being unfair to Jaya?</i>

1841
02:10:36,221 --> 02:10:38,284
<i>Am I betraying Jaya?</i>

1842
02:10:41,259 --> 02:10:42,967
<i>I really miss you, Mom.</i>

1843
02:10:43,253 --> 02:10:45,428
Your mother will always be close to you.

1844
02:10:50,346 --> 02:10:51,872
<i>Will you please stroke my hair, Mom?</i>

1845
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,283
<i>Please, Mom.</i>

1846
02:11:12,886 --> 02:11:14,220
My dear boy...

1847
02:11:15,729 --> 02:11:17,091
My dear boy!

1848
02:11:23,625 --> 02:11:24,958
My dear boy...

1849
02:11:25,305 --> 02:11:27,772
...your mothers sewing box...

1850
02:11:28,083 --> 02:11:31,500
...and this copy were with me.

1851
02:11:31,769 --> 02:11:32,947
Take it.

1852
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:46,333
- Uncle.
- Yes?

1853
02:11:47,128 --> 02:11:48,920
How is the uncle at the grocer's?

1854
02:11:50,537 --> 02:11:52,579
He has cancer.

1855
02:11:53,003 --> 02:11:54,818
He's hosptalised.

1856
02:12:03,934 --> 02:12:06,315
Uncle.
This is Shibaji.

1857
02:12:06,669 --> 02:12:07,791
Who?

1858
02:12:09,238 --> 02:12:09,863
Your darling boy.

1859
02:12:11,285 --> 02:12:14,868
My boy!
How much you have grown...

1860
02:12:14,936 --> 02:12:17,812
You have so many pictures
in the newspapers.

1861
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:21,529
I tell the doctors
all about you.

1862
02:12:23,087 --> 02:12:24,363
Uncle...

1863
02:12:25,958 --> 02:12:27,918
Why didn't you tell me?

1864
02:12:28,697 --> 02:12:31,184
No, I'm okay.
Totally fit!

1865
02:12:31,374 --> 02:12:32,505
Uncle...

1866
02:12:36,295 --> 02:12:38,735
Today I fight in the
World Championship boxing match.

1867
02:12:41,465 --> 02:12:43,107
Please bless me.

1868
02:12:43,569 --> 02:12:45,902
Who am I to bless you?

1869
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:48,663
The people of the country
are blessing you.

1870
02:12:49,301 --> 02:12:50,163
You will win.

1871
02:12:51,016 --> 02:12:53,659
<i>You will win.</i>

1872
02:12:55,095 --> 02:12:57,174
<i>Fly like a butterfly...</i>

1873
02:12:57,739 --> 02:12:59,569
And sting like a bee.

1874
02:13:40,293 --> 02:13:41,877
These are Mom's things.

1875
02:13:42,088 --> 02:13:43,748
Today...
Jaya?

1876
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:00,883
Feeling unwell?

1877
02:14:04,292 --> 02:14:06,153
You are unwell.

1878
02:14:07,083 --> 02:14:08,392
Aren't you?

1879
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:12,194
Me? What?

1880
02:14:12,613 --> 02:14:13,813
Not at all.

1881
02:14:14,823 --> 02:14:16,172
One minute.

1882
02:14:23,877 --> 02:14:25,293
What is this?

1883
02:14:25,625 --> 02:14:27,881
- Who are you trying to fool?
- Jaya...

1884
02:14:27,905 --> 02:14:29,813
I had called Dr. Sen.

1885
02:14:30,092 --> 02:14:32,384
Your rib cage is still broken.

1886
02:14:32,652 --> 02:14:33,861
I'm okay.

1887
02:14:34,015 --> 02:14:36,348
You are bleeding
from the nose and mouth!

1888
02:14:37,603 --> 02:14:39,603
Who are you trying to win for?

1889
02:14:40,752 --> 02:14:43,835
You have a daughter!
And a family!

1890
02:14:44,330 --> 02:14:45,553
And you...

1891
02:14:46,348 --> 02:14:47,744
Disgusting!

1892
02:14:48,578 --> 02:14:49,754
Jaya...

1893
02:15:07,736 --> 02:15:10,111
Jaya, I'm a fighter.

1894
02:15:11,089 --> 02:15:14,541
I was fighting
even when I lost everything

1895
02:15:14,609 --> 02:15:16,057
And I am still fighting.

1896
02:15:17,122 --> 02:15:20,585
Life has given me
another chance to win.

1897
02:15:21,676 --> 02:15:23,601
Please support me.

1898
02:15:33,194 --> 02:15:35,791
Everyone is fighting
in their own way, Jaya.

1899
02:15:37,627 --> 02:15:39,084
Some wear gloves...

1900
02:15:40,167 --> 02:15:41,552
...and some don't.

1901
02:15:43,275 --> 02:15:45,338
I may fall behind today.

1902
02:15:46,616 --> 02:15:50,528
You left your father and your wealth...

1903
02:15:50,787 --> 02:15:53,345
...and fought for me
with barely enough to eat.

1904
02:15:55,458 --> 02:15:58,059
What have I given you in exchange?

1905
02:15:58,084 --> 02:15:59,334
Shibaji.

1906
02:15:59,954 --> 02:16:02,336
I only want you.

1907
02:16:03,233 --> 02:16:04,525
I know.

1908
02:16:05,301 --> 02:16:07,384
But what will I tell my daughter?

1909
02:16:07,792 --> 02:16:10,772
I want to show her
my World Championship belt.

1910
02:16:12,761 --> 02:16:14,383
I want to tell her about my fight!

1911
02:16:14,417 --> 02:16:17,438
- But the doctor is saying that...
- Let him!

1912
02:16:18,013 --> 02:16:20,180
Why are you being so stubborn?

1913
02:16:20,346 --> 02:16:21,415
Why?

1914
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,081
This is all I have left, Jaya.

1915
02:16:26,166 --> 02:16:28,000
Only this.

1916
02:16:31,665 --> 02:16:34,708
House, cars, money, pride...

1917
02:16:35,872 --> 02:16:38,538
Everything has all been washed away.

1918
02:16:40,072 --> 02:16:42,989
The only thing left is my stubborn will.

1919
02:16:45,636 --> 02:16:47,647
Please be by my side.

1920
02:16:49,035 --> 02:16:51,244
This is a fight for my life, Jaya.

1921
02:16:52,913 --> 02:16:54,090
Not boxing.

1922
02:16:54,301 --> 02:16:56,392
But if something happens to you...

1923
02:16:57,458 --> 02:16:59,625
...how will we live, Shiba?

1924
02:17:05,695 --> 02:17:07,028
Listen...

1925
02:17:11,237 --> 02:17:13,034
Nothing will happen to me.

1926
02:17:13,133 --> 02:17:16,008
Please, Shiba.
Please!

1927
02:17:17,598 --> 02:17:18,732
Please...

1928
02:17:33,402 --> 02:17:35,639
Tell my story to my daughter.

1929
02:17:36,303 --> 02:17:41,795
Tell her that I loved you intensely
till my last breath.

1930
02:17:44,167 --> 02:17:45,929
And loved her too.

1931
02:17:49,228 --> 02:17:51,595
Tell people like me who are broken...

1932
02:17:52,236 --> 02:17:54,746
...not to worry.

1933
02:17:56,583 --> 02:17:59,583
But to face their fears
with fists up.

1934
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:02,515
And punch as hard as they can.

1935
02:18:02,986 --> 02:18:04,690
One-two-two.

1936
02:18:07,505 --> 02:18:09,505
I have to win, Jaya.

1937
02:18:17,810 --> 02:18:21,865
<i>This is the World Boxing Championship
at Kolkata Netaji Indoor Stadium...</i>

1938
02:18:21,890 --> 02:18:26,239
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
World Championship Boxing.</i>

1939
02:18:26,263 --> 02:18:28,580
(commentary)

1940
02:18:30,179 --> 02:18:34,893
<i>The World Championship is set to begin.
There will be fireworks in the ring today!</i>

1941
02:18:34,917 --> 02:18:38,226
<i>On the one hand is Shibaji Sanyal
and on the other, is defender...</i>

1942
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:40,330
<i>...Evan Terryjobs!</i>

1943
02:18:47,616 --> 02:18:48,878
<i>...he has 69 wins.</i>

1944
02:18:48,902 --> 02:18:54,116
<i>And 59 of his opponents
have nearly died in the ring.</i>

1945
02:19:19,918 --> 02:19:21,408
Red corner.

1946
02:19:21,638 --> 02:19:25,351
<i>Everyone is eagerly waiting.
The first round is about to begin.</i>

1947
02:19:25,376 --> 02:19:26,543
Blue corner.

1948
02:19:26,568 --> 02:19:28,235
Ready to box?

1949
02:19:29,622 --> 02:19:31,220
Box!

1950
02:19:38,297 --> 02:19:39,381
One.

1951
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:40,833
Two.

1952
02:19:41,015 --> 02:19:42,241
- Get up!
- Three.

1953
02:19:42,535 --> 02:19:43,630
<i>Four.</i>

1954
02:19:44,136 --> 02:19:45,360
<i>Five.</i>

1955
02:19:45,823 --> 02:19:47,055
<i>Six.</i>

1956
02:19:47,996 --> 02:19:49,245
<i>Seven.</i>

1957
02:19:50,134 --> 02:19:51,618
Ready to box?

1958
02:19:54,337 --> 02:19:55,297
Punch him hard!

1959
02:19:55,321 --> 02:19:59,543
<i>Both are continuing to attack
and dodge the other's punches...</i>

1960
02:19:59,568 --> 02:20:00,250
Hit!

1961
02:20:00,544 --> 02:20:02,353
<i>Shibaji wants to take it slow.</i>

1962
02:20:02,378 --> 02:20:06,218
<i>But he didn't get the time.
One solid shot send him to the ground.</i>

1963
02:20:06,258 --> 02:20:09,361
<i>Shibaji is in for a tough fight.</i>

1964
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,251
One.

1965
02:20:14,378 --> 02:20:17,005
A Bengali should only
play cricket or football!

1966
02:20:17,907 --> 02:20:19,236
Boxing! Hmmph!

1967
02:20:20,236 --> 02:20:22,225
Don't fight like a soft Bengali!

1968
02:20:22,424 --> 02:20:23,768
Fight like a tiger!

1969
02:20:24,768 --> 02:20:26,288
Fight like a tiger!

1970
02:20:32,370 --> 02:20:37,196
