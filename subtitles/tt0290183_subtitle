1
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,185
Mother, hurry up and bless your son and...

2
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:14,385
..place a hundred rupee note on my palm.

3
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:16,185
Why? Why the money?

4
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:20,285
Mother, I'll get a job with your blessings,
and a girl with the money.

5
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:21,785
And..
- What happened?

6
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,895
Mother, you are also looking stunning today.
- You naughty!

7
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:31,495
If some girl falls yor your handsome son, and like her too..

8
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:36,095
..then to discuss romance, we'll have to drink coffee.

9
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:37,995
And money is required for coffee.

10
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,999
Dear, here you are,
and have the breakfast now.

11
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,399
Mother, I've had my breakfast!

12
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,772
I'll go, and meet father. By the way,
how's the A.C.P's mood?

13
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:50,372
What was the need to
displace the file?

14
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:52,472
- Sir, I tought..
- Why did you think so?

15
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,987
You presume things on your own!

16
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:58,181
Dad..
- Yes.

17
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:01,204
Blessings. I see.

18
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:03,636
You are going for the interview, right?
- Yes.

19
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,693
Why are you wearing such a shirt?

20
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:08,493
Actually..
- You too are strange!

21
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:10,993
What's wrong with the shirt?
It's looking good.

22
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:15,993
It's not bad; I was just pointing
out the color.

23
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,961
Wait a minute. Wear a tie with it.

24
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,161
Mother, again!

25
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:23,361
Yes. This color would suit.

26
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,281
Button it.
- Sure.

27
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:30,854
Vishaal, it's dress that makes
the first impression.

28
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:34,551
The way you dress up says a lot
about your character.

29
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,651
It makes a statement about your personality too.

30
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:41,427
Thank you dad!
- Best of luck!

31
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,025
Ok, mummy!
- All the best, son.

32
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:47,552
Did you make your son understand?

33
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:50,052
He should've control over his anger
during the interview?

34
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:51,752
He fights with everybody.

35
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:54,652
He's taken the trait from you.
But he looks so handsome!

36
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,306
He is my son after all.

37
00:03:57,506 --> 00:04:00,106
So you'll take the credit for this too?

38
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,200
Sit down man!
Why do you ask for water all the time?

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,800
There a shortage of water over here.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Brother, wenn will the Boss arrive?

41
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,989
How many times do I have to tell you?

42
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,989
Go and sit over there!
Bothering me so much.

43
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:17,489
Why do you come here daily when
the boss is not interested in meeting you.?

44
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:18,689
Is it any 'Flora-fountain'?

45
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:19,489
What's happening?

46
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,289
Sir, he..

47
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:25,583
Listen, you're avoiding
me for past three days.

48
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,881
I've spent 35 years of
my life in this company.

49
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:35,289
I've toiled for this company.
You got me out so easily.

50
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:38,289
Had your Brother been here,
he'd not have got me out in this manner.

51
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:40,489
Mr. Gupta, we need
people here that can work.

52
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:44,589
I can't pay salary to people sitting idle.
Moreover you can't even see properly.

53
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,289
Mr. Khanna, I've got a new glass made.
I won't have any trouble now.

54
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,001
I won't give you any chance to complain.

55
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,801
I've got two grown up girls.
Let me work for a few..

56
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,501
You're wasting my time.
I've done for you what I had to.

57
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,501
Babu, show him the way out!
- Yes Boss!

58
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,465
Didn't I tell you beforehand? Move! Move!
- Mr. Khanna!

59
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:07,284
You're weakening the company
by chucking out people like me!

60
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:10,084
Mr. Khanna, this isn't fair.
This isn't fair.

61
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,419
Mr. Vishal Chaudhary.

62
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:21,907
The children who are to be awarded here today..

63
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,740
..are the foundation stones of our country.

64
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:31,762
Children, I'll narrate you a true
story of a child's bravery:

65
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:34,807
There were many people
travelling in a city bus once.

66
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,079
Suddenly, a goon brandished a big knife..

67
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,579
..and tried to snatch a woman's gold chain

68
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:50,297
A child in the bus saw this.

69
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:53,297
He hit the goon on his
head, with his tiffin-box.

70
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,521
The goon then dropped the knife.

71
00:05:57,785 --> 00:06:01,985
And the other passengers overpowered him.

72
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:05,085
This way, the brave child prevented

73
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,680
..the gold chain from being stolen.

74
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,180
That boy is Manish Sawant.

75
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,711
Tell me one thing.

76
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:28,998
What do you want to be when you grow up?

77
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,698
I'll become an officer like you
and punish all the hooligans.

78
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:38,716
Mr. Chaudhary I am not against
attending any function.

79
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,389
But a such times when our police dept is being questioned

80
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:46,174
..it doesn' look proper to stand on stage, garlanded,..

81
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,974
..and listen to people' applaiuse.

82
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:52,244
Sir, I'd not gone there
to get myself garlanded.

83
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,100
I didn't even go to accept
any medal or shield.

84
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:58,143
I had simply gone
to encourage the children..

85
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,332
Hello! Mrs. Bharucha?

86
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:05,651
Oh yes Mrs. Bharucha, yes!
How are you doing?

87
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,591
What would I do in the
inauguration of a beauty parlour?

88
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:12,245
My wife will be coming.

89
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,368
All right. All right, Mrs. Bharucha.
I too shall join.

90
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:24,346
Daddy, I can't work with such people.
I can't tolerate such tings.

91
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:26,834
Dear, what's it that you can't stand?

92
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,433
What do you think you are?

93
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:34,733
Bring a little flexibility to your temperament.

94
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:38,072
It's now that you'll face the real world.

95
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,866
When you occupy yourself in some work,
you'll understand this.

96
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:47,866
Wonderful! I can't stand all this!

97
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,618
I've got a class early morning.

98
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:55,284
Mother, what does daddy
think about me?

99
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,860
Doe's he think I' am his daughter-in-law?

100
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:00,397
When I've already come into this world, I will get to see everything.

101
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:03,318
Unnecessarily!
He keeps lecturing me all the time!

102
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,918
Vishal!
- Gone case!

103
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,618
Vishal, my file was lying here?
- Yes! Yes daddy!

104
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:10,418
Here!
- Oh! Alright!

105
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:11,618
I'm going.
- Yes.

106
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:17,184
It's good he left.
If not then I was about to tell him.

107
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,184
Do I fear him?
- No, no.

108
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:20,884
He fears you.
- What else?

109
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:23,505
By the way, what happened to the money I gave?

110
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:26,989
Did you ask someone out for a coffee?
- No, mother!

111
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:28,989
I never get any job or girl
- Keep quiet!

112
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,077
Marriages are made in heaven.

113
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,077
There must be a beautiful girl for you to.

114
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,256
Oh God!
- Oh God

115
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:56,929
Oh God!
- Oh God

116
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,771
O Lord, when would you notice me?

117
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,243
When would my prayers be answered?

118
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:06,337
O' Almighty! Please give me one chance!

119
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,397
I'll prove myeslf the best
amongst the heroines.

120
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:12,956
My obeisances to Mr. Dev Anand!

121
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:23,678
Do you see? This madness for films will ruin her.

122
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,678
She'll land herself in a big mess.

123
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:28,578
Ask her to pray a little to God.

124
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:33,478
She'll be on track. She's still a kid.
- She's still a kid.

125
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,678
What's this?
- Mohini's breakfast. - Is this breakfast?

126
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:41,499
Boiled potatoes and..
- Lukewarm water with honey.

127
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:43,305
Nowadays I'm on a diet.

128
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:48,005
Dad, actually we artists
have got to look after our figure.

129
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,164
But why have you left eating?

130
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,639
Even I don't get it. She
stopped eating all of a sudden.

131
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,683
I tell you. Take her to some doctor.

132
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:00,583
Am I crazy to take her to a doctor?

133
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,083
She'll get the doctor bedridden.

134
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:05,248
Daddy, I was thinking of something.

135
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:08,648
Suppose I got exchanged with a

136
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:10,548
..rich man's daughter in some nursing home.

137
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:11,748
Just like the film 'Bhagyawaan'..

138
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,170
I'd have been brought up over there.

139
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,770
Bungalow, cars servants...wow!

140
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:22,086
And she? Over here.
In this house of yours.

141
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:26,006
Enough. I am going.
You tolerate her.

142
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:28,644
Daddy, please give me 200 rupees.

143
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,641
You take these from that millionare.

144
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,216
Daddy, please give! I've got to visit the beauty parlour.
- No!

145
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:40,658
Don't you feel shy wearing these
clothes borrowing from people?

146
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:44,651
They are nice, right? Daddy,
I've got to have a face massage.

147
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:45,978
Please give me the money.

148
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,178
Shut up! I am not one
of the corrupt policeman..

149
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:52,378
..to give you 200 rupees for
a face massage in a salary of 1400 rupees.

150
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:55,478
Listen. Please
don't break her heart.

151
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:56,902
Take these bangles..

152
00:10:57,102 --> 00:11:00,202
..give her 200 rupees by mortgaging them.
- No, mother!

153
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:03,302
No, mother! No, mother!
Don't do this!

154
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,502
I'll only make some way out.

155
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,303
Hey!...What nonsense are you talking?

156
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:11,343
Nothing. I was dreaming actually.

157
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:14,343
Look. You don't get
yourself in any other trouble.

158
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:15,943
I am always scared of you.

159
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,909
That, due to you I may get transferred to Junagadh.

160
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,023
I dont wish to go to Junagadh at this age.

161
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,623
Before your duty, understand
the significance of this place.

162
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,190
What a condition this police station is in!

163
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:32,871
This..What files are these over here?

164
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:34,171
Sir, Ill get them sorted out in a short while.

165
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,593
This is really shameful!

166
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:39,124
Please get this mess cleaned.

167
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,620
Whats this?

168
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:48,735
F..F..
- Its the F.I.R. register.- Yes.

169
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,435
You register the report in it.

170
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:55,352
Mr. Devki Nandan, Ive got your transfer stopped twice.

171
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:58,362
Ill get you sent straight to
Junagadh this time. Junagadh!

172
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,061
Do you know why the A.C.P keeps threatening

173
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,061
.. to transfer me to Junagadh?

174
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:14,037
Hes gone through my fathers file.

175
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:16,237
My father had killed the bandit Bhupat.

176
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,337
And Bhupat's grandson is
waiting for me at Junagadh.

177
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,237
If I happen to go there, then Ill be..

178
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,830
Ill only be going to Junagadh, but never returning back.

179
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,145
Now I'll have to do your work too.

180
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,300
Lift.Lift.

181
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:35,406
Idiot. What do they think they are? Oh no!

182
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,710
Lift.Lift...Yes.

183
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:49,812
Hi!

184
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:52,914
Will you give me a lift?

185
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,114
Yes, yes. Please be seated.

186
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:57,197
Please come! Its all yours!

187
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,397
Thank you. Thank you very much!

188
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:06,691
Take right from here.

189
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,381
Dont worry.
- Left?

190
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:13,614
I asked you for right!
 Yes.

191
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:14,414
Not an issue.

192
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:16,524
Where are you taking me to?

193
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:17,992
Keep sitting quietly.

194
00:13:19,138 --> 00:13:23,038
I took a wrong lift.
Brother, please drop me ahead.

195
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:24,938
Please. Actually..Actually..Look, I..

196
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,329
Please drop me at the side of the road!

197
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,773
No..
 Dont panic. Think this to be your own house.

198
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,873
Leave me! I am telling you! Leave me!

199
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:37,973
Sit, my Queen! Where are you going?

200
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:47,133
Oh no! Brother please let me go. Please!

201
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,790
I am like a sister to you, right?

202
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,290
Even I am like your husband, right?

203
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,409
You won't agree, scoundrel!

204
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:09,841
How can you escape? Its my 25th rape.
Ill celebrate a jubilee. Jubilee!

205
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,958
Save me! Leave me!

206
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,334
Leave me! Help!

207
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:35,532
Is somebody there?

208
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,699
Save me! Help! Help! Save me!

209
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,467
Save me!

210
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:55,971
Save me! Somebody save me! Save me!

211
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:05,542
Dont hit me! Buddy, dont hit me!

212
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:08,042
Ive committed 24 rapes and
nobody hit me.You dont do that too.

213
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,108
Dont hit me.
 You cheap!

214
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:12,308
Mummy!

215
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,747
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Move. Move I said!

216
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:26,948
Mr. Hero!

217
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,390
Mr. Hero! Mr. Hero! Please wait!

218
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:33,072
Whats it?

219
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,340
Wonderful! You made entry at the perfect time.

220
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Just like in the films.

221
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,170
How did you know a rape was going on?

222
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,370
Were you standing nearby?
 Leave me aside.

223
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,370
You tell me, what are you doing
in this isolated place?

224
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:47,068
I! I didnt come here on my own.

225
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:48,468
I was brought to this place.

226
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:50,668
Actually, Id asked him for a lift and..

227
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,243
Anyway! Whatever the God does,
he does it for the good.

228
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:56,743
Moreover there has to be a situation in the..

229
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,043
..films that the hero and heroine meet.

230
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:01,486
This situation has always been a hit.
Its been a hit, right?

231
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:03,286
Ok come on. Now drop me home fast.

232
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,333
Have a cup of tea and meet my mother.

233
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:09,347
It appears as if shes crazy.

234
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:10,647
What are you waiting for? Lets go, dear!

235
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,178
Yes. Anytime later.

236
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:14,878
Dont do this please.
How would I go home?

237
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,721
Take a lift.

238
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,067
He's leaving! It never happens like this!

239
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:25,187
Dear, how did you sprain yourself?

240
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:28,587
Mother! Something extraordinary
happened. Just like in films!

241
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,487
A girl ask for a lift from somebody.

242
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:36,387
The girl sits in the car as
the car comes to a halt.

243
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,087
By then the drivers intention changes.

244
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:45,372
The girl realizes this. She tries to escape
but the man grabs her hand.

245
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,572
He holds her hand!

246
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:50,296
But what were you doing there
while this was happening?

247
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,196
Mother, I was that girl!

248
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,562
Again a new story!

249
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,904
Oh God!..Then?

250
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,060
Then the girl escapes from
the cluthes of the villain.

251
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,260
The villain runs after her. Hes able to get hold of her.
 Then?

252
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:10,614
Then the hero enters the scene on time,
in front of the camera.

253
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:15,012
After that its, all fisticuffs!

254
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:18,312
Mother, he bashes up the villain.

255
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,812
He was such hero! Wow!

256
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,912
The Almighty mustve sent him!

257
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:27,793
Or else we wouldve lost our dignity today.
 Absolutely!

258
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,593
Else Itd have been the headline
of tomorrows newspaper.

259
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:32,593
That the daughter of head
constable Devki Nandan..

260
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:35,093
..becomes a victim of rape.

261
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:38,193
Look. You better srop these
nonsense acts of yours.

262
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,580
Or else Ill get it published int he
papers that we share no relation.

263
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,880
Please dont do this.
Shes still a kid.

264
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,069
Whats her age after all?

265
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,380
Shes the only daughter of ours.

266
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,380
She is my only mistake.

267
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:54,919
Ive been listening to the same dialogue for the past 19 years.

268
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,319
Shes still a kid! Shes still a kid! Shes still..

269
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,639
Dear, you shouldve brought him home.

270
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,450
Mother, he was a very strange boy.

271
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,850
He didnt give any importance to me at all!

272
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,050
The hero surely comes to drop the heroine to..

273
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,250
..her house in such a situation.

274
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,353
Id to come by a bus.

275
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:16,182
Mother, you dont worry.
Hell meet me again.

276
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,770
Mother, hes still got to sing songs with me.

277
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,707
My heart cried!

278
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,740
My heart cried!

279
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,883
Weve begun our love and youre still smoring!

280
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,883
My heart cried!

281
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:58,661
Ive become crazy
for such a crazy guy.

282
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:03,973
Ive become oblivious
of the whole world.

283
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:09,396
Ive become crazy
for such a crazy guy.

284
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,590
Ive become oblivious
of the whole world.

285
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,090
Do let me know your
hearts intentions.

286
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,227
My heart cried!

287
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:33,477
"Weve begun our love
and youre still snoring!

288
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:35,377
My heart cried!

289
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:16,967
Youve got to marry me
one day for sure.

290
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:21,967
We have got to put
up with each other.

291
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:27,692
Youve got to marry me
one day for sure.

292
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:32,843
We have got to put
up with each other.

293
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:38,443
The one that the boys do is being done by a girl.

294
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,397
My heart cried!"

295
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:51,539
"Weve begun our love
and youre still snoring!

296
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:53,239
My heart cried!"

297
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:04,408
My heart cried!"

298
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:10,572
Daughter, is it some new devotional song?

299
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,390
MyYes priest.
You wont understand.

300
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:19,811
For that, your mind has to be excited, romantic,

301
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:24,357
..and youthful.

302
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:30,304
Priest, a dashing hero has entered in my life.

303
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,380
Tell God to do something. Please.

304
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,180
Its Monday today.

305
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,080
Your wish will surely
come true if you come..

306
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,580
..and worship for seven Mondays.

307
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,266
Is it true?
 Dear, don't doubt the greatness of God!

308
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:51,604
Sorry!

309
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,599
You? Wow!

310
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,600
The very first Monday has
begun to show its effect.

311
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:03,444
What are you doing here?

312
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:04,644
I keep frequenting this temple.

313
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:07,444
Is it! Alone?

314
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:09,484
No. With my mother.

315
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:10,884
But she comes separately.

316
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:12,307
Why separately?

317
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:15,507
She comes to ask for a
daughter-in-law and I for a job.

318
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,507
The wish of your mother has come true.

319
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,448
Your mother has found her daughter-in law.

320
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:22,883
I'll pray every Monday for your job.

321
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,083
Wait a moment!

322
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:26,183
What do you mean that she's
found a daughter-in-law?

323
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:28,054
Yes! It's me!

324
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,916
Priest, what do you have to say?

325
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,275
How do we look as a couple?

326
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:36,993
The woman has become so straightforward!
Heavens! O heavens!

327
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,404
Did you hear? I am Radha
and you are my Krishna.

328
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:42,604
Lets go and sit somewhere.

329
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:44,204
No, no. Ive got to make an important call.

330
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:46,904
Address, location, telephone number something..

331
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:48,504
A.C.P. Chaudhary is may dad.

332
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,090
Ill find out your telephone number.

333
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:58,994
Yes, yes. Ill surely meet you.
Yes, brother Vijay.

334
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:01,994
Please make it fast, man!
- Two minutes.

335
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:03,394
Two minutes! Its been half an hour.

336
00:24:03,594 --> 00:24:04,694
Hello. Yes.

337
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,299
Doctor, treat him fast and save him!
- What happened to him?

338
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:44,599
Ive no idea who they were!

339
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,799
They came in a van and run him down.
Doctor, please save him!

340
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,899
Its an accident case.
Gupta, please call up the police.

341
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,599
Doctor, this man shall die till the police arrive!

342
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,099
What can we do?

343
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,199
You cant do anything, but I can.
 Stop!

344
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:01,628
Vishal, what are you doing? Leave him.

345
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,539
Look! Look!

346
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,436
He too is a human being.
Hes got a soul too! He..

347
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:21,173
He's dead.

348
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:26,048
He died! He died!
 Vishal!

349
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,405
Do accept the mistake youve made.

350
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:31,805
Yes! Ive made mistake.

351
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,890
A man was suffering severely in a pool of blood.

352
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,190
I made mistake by taking him to the hospital.

353
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:39,824
I shouldnt have done it. Right?
 Vishal!

354
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:41,324
Mother, I ought not to have done it.

355
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:43,924
I ought to have left him there to die.

356
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:46,705
Just the way people went away
leaving my brother. Isnt it?

357
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:50,031
Dad, had someone made a similar mistake..

358
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:51,894
..my brother wouldnt have died.

359
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:53,203
He wouldve been alive.

360
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:04,437
Itd be difficult to ascertain
that this man belonged..

361
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:06,437
..to Baba Khan or Mana Shetty.

362
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,757
His face has been..
 Its burnt by acid.

363
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:14,085
Who did the other corpse belong to?

364
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,585
Sir, his name is Waman Chaurasia.

365
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:17,685
He lives int he nearby slum of Shanti Nagar.

366
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:19,729
Have you informed his relatives?

367
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:21,129
Sir, hes got only one son.

368
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,829
Hes in coma at Cooper hospital.

369
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,329
Going to buy medicines for him,
he was crossing the road and..

370
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:30,709
Whatever is happening between Baba Khan and Mana Shetty.
 Yes sir.

371
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:32,709
Its all the result of that.
 Yes sir.

372
00:26:33,214 --> 00:26:36,514
Thats why keep an eye on the men of both the parties.
 Right, sir.

373
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:39,614
Somebody call my boss.
Ill die!

374
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:42,814
Why are you crying like a whore?
Nothing will happen to you!

375
00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:46,954
Just shut up! You crying like a girl!

376
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:50,254
Brother, please call the boss. Ill die!

377
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:51,454
Shut up!

378
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:09,032
I cant bear it! Call the boss!

379
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:27,978
Ive removed the bullet and hes out of danger.

380
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:30,493
But a rod will have to be fitted into the leg.

381
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:33,551
He won't be able to walk again

382
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:36,651
There is nothing without movement.

383
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:40,551
Boss, please save me!
- Dont worry Babba!

384
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,300
Time never remains constant.

385
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,200
Its all natural movement.

386
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:48,515
Morning, evening, night and again morning.

387
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,544
Everything keeps rolling from time to time.

388
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:56,719
A man should face each and every moment.

389
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:02,075
Youve done a big job by splashing acid on Masoods face.

390
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,947
Dont worry about the police.

391
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:08,415
Babba, the past seven year record of yours has been commendable.

392
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:14,072
On oct. 2 you killed constable
Sharma at Kherwadi.

393
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:16,672
You got arrested on 19th November..

394
00:28:16,972 --> 00:28:20,572
.. remanded for 3 days, and bailed on nov. 23.

395
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:26,174
The file of Sharmas murder
got closed on 26th January.

396
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
After this you faultlessy committed 7 murders.
after this without leaving any trace.

397
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:36,864
Babba, one enters a goverment
service at the age of 25,..

398
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:39,764
..the tenure is of 30 years and
the retirement age is 55.

399
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:45,026
We have no fixed age for getting a job
or one for retirement in our profession.

400
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:47,828
I'll retire you now.

401
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:50,428
No, boss! Boss, please forgive me!
Please forgive me!

402
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:56,328
No, Babba.I can't keep you
in a corner like broken furniture.

403
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:08,896
He ran away from the battlefield
like a coward.Hopeless creature!

404
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,326
He used to talk could only wrestle with women.

405
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,040
He was, in fact, a coward for sure.

406
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:24,046
Because of this bastard, Mana Shetty
must be beating his chest like this.

407
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:25,846
Like this! Like this! Like this!

408
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:32,126
He thinks he can fight Khan. With Khan.

409
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:35,517
The one that gave him the
first bread in this city..

410
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:37,016
..he dares to fight him!

411
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,216
Mana, what are you talking?
Whats this youre talking?

412
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:42,393
This violence and blood shedding!

413
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:45,493
What would you gain out of it? Tell me!

414
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,682
Hey uncle! Do not teach Mana.

415
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:51,982
I know everything.
I know everything.

416
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:55,082
What do you know? To shoot people?

417
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:58,153
You shot him today
and shoot him tomorrow.

418
00:29:58,353 --> 00:30:00,953
You may shoot your brother tomorrow, right?
 Yes, I will.

419
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:06,478
Id told everyone before they
entered this profession.

420
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:10,078
Mana. Hey Mana! I fail to understand you!

421
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:14,557
Youll shoot everyone.
Youve gone mad! Mad!

422
00:30:14,757 --> 00:30:19,457
Hey, uncle! Shut your mouth.
Or else Ill shoot you.

423
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,280
Mana Shetty knows only one thing.

424
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
He should control the other
channels of the crime world.

425
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,080
Parvati, Id got my transfer stalled.
Where are those papers?

426
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:39,292
Mohinis diary! 629029

427
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,650
This number sounds familiar.
Dutta Maternity Home.. No!

428
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,050
Mohini is not married yet. 629029!

429
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:54,165
Its the number of Mr. Chaudharys residence.

430
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:57,771
Mr. Chaudharys number! In Mohinis diary!
 Daddy!

431
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:00,371
How many times Ive told you that its my personal diary.

432
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:01,471
You too..

433
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:05,024
How did the number of Mr. Chaudhary
got mentioned in your diary?

434
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:07,521
Listen! Mohini! Heavens!

435
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,159
Hello.
- Hello. Is Vishal at home?

436
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,259
Whos speaking?
 I..I..Actually..

437
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:46,218
I got it. Vishal.
 Mother, coming.

438
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:47,418
Its a call for you.

439
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:49,724
Whos it mother?

440
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:52,524
Ive no idea. Its some that!
 That!

441
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:57,751
Yes, hello.
 Beloved, how do you do?

442
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,450
Are you wondering
from where I got your number?

443
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:05,528
Everything is possible.

444
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,700
Only the love should cross the limit.

445
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,908
Mother, its an old friend.
Very nice friend.

446
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:12,581
Yes, hello!

447
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:16,044
What happened?
Is aunt standing near you?

448
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:17,344
No. Shes sitting.

449
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:22,776
So what? You tell her that
youre speaking to your..

450
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,976
..beloved, your lover and your life.

451
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,376
Yes, of course. Of course.

452
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:27,576
Whats yes of course? Listen. Look.

453
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:31,576
We'll have to drive our car of love
with the speed of this age.

454
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:34,476
Thats why an emergency meeting is very..

455
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:35,827
..important for the future planning.

456
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:39,049
Mother, she is asking about book.

457
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,924
Yes, Ive given that book to someone.

458
00:32:43,736 --> 00:32:46,336
I dont know. Yes, Ill find out. Yes, Ill let you know.

459
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:47,536
Thats not rquired.

460
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:50,418
Ill meet you at the same spot where we meet for the first time.

461
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:56,827
By the way, I hope
this book is not a love story.

462
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,479
Reading such books make one perspire so much!

463
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:01,943
Move away, you naughty!

464
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:06,788
So? Didnt fast formula work?
- What formula?

465
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:10,588
Just see. We have come so close in just a few meetings..

466
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,933
..or else it takes years over
here to make the eye contact.

467
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,133
Yes, what you say holds true.

468
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:18,575
Love anyway shouldn't
be stretched out for too long.

469
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:20,402
Earlier the heroine..

470
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:22,602
..and the hero used to meet in
a veil and in Indian attire.

471
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:24,394
The books used to fall down.

472
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:26,394
Both used to bend
to pick up the books.

473
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:28,494
The head used to collide and then..

474
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:36,592
My beloved I swear my love for you..."

475
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,099
These things dont
work in todays time.

476
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:43,199
Nowadays they meet,
the hearts melt, they hug and..

477
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:44,899
Juma, give me a kiss!

478
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:15,137
It was morning and
then came evening.

479
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:19,037
The heart kept remembering you.

480
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:22,737
It was morning and
then came evening.

481
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:26,537
The heart kept remembering you.

482
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:29,537
The crazy in your love...

483
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:33,237
Yes, the crazy in your love...

484
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:36,937
..did remember you every
second and each moment.

485
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:40,837
It was morning and
then came evening.

486
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,437
The heart kept remembering you.

487
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:48,137
It was morning and
then came evening.

488
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:51,637
The heart kept remembering you.

489
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:55,118
The crazy in your love...

490
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:58,718
Yes, the crazy in your love...

491
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:02,618
..did remember you every
second and each moment.

492
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:06,218
It was morning and
then came evening.

493
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:09,818
The heart kept remembering you.

494
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:42,394
Id never thought.

495
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:46,094
That so happens in love even.

496
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:49,681
Id never thought.

497
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,281
That even this happens in love.

498
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:57,172
I and my soul have separated.

499
00:35:57,372 --> 00:36:00,572
The heart keeps crying and laughing.

500
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:04,311
The past that I spent with you.."

501
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:07,811
".. happened to remember me.

502
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:11,411
It was morning and
then came evening.

503
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:15,111
The heart kept remembering you.

504
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:18,711
It was morning and
then came evening.

505
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:22,211
The heart kept remembering you.

506
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:06,971
When the cold breeze begins to blow.

507
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:10,372
I take hold of my heart.

508
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:14,272
When the cold breeze begins to blow.

509
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:17,525
I take hold of my heart.

510
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:25,103
I pray so that we
unite at the earliest.

511
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:32,349
The fragrance floating in
the air did remember you.

512
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:36,049
It was morning and
then came evening.

513
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:39,649
The heart kept remembering you.

514
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:43,549
It was morning and
then came evening.

515
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:47,049
The heart kept remembering you.

516
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:50,749
The crazy in your love...

517
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,349
Yes, the crazy in your love...

518
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:58,049
..did remember you every
second and each moment.

519
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:01,449
It was morning and
- then came evening.

520
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:04,949
The heart kept remembering you.

521
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:08,669
It was morning and
- then came evening.

522
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,369
The heart kept remembering you.

523
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:16,346
Do you now understand..

524
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:17,546
..why did Mohini have the number of Mr. Chaudary?

525
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:23,146
She was singing a song with Mr. Chaudarys son Vishal.

526
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:25,263
Thats fine. At least she liked a boy.

527
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:29,408
She's of age now.
 I see!

528
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:34,332
She was a kid until yesterday and shes a grown up person today!

529
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:39,232
You're great! I salute you.

530
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:42,032
Please meet Mr. Chaudary and speak about their marriage.

531
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:44,482
You remained a duffer.

532
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:48,082
Hes an A.C.P. and I am a head constable.

533
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:49,582
Well become in-laws?

534
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:53,685
Well embrace each other tying the turban? Talk to him!

535
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:59,285
Daddy! Daddy, whose marriage? Youll marry?

536
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:03,849
Mother! Youll bring another woman in this house?

537
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,049
I am discussing about your marriage.

538
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:09,049
About your future with Vishal.

539
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,449
Have you given a thought to it?

540
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:15,049
Daddy, I know that therell be a turn in my love story.

541
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:18,249
Thats why Ive got my dialogues ready beforehand.

542
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:21,949
Daddy, love is blind.

543
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:25,149
It doesn't differentiate between high and low.

544
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:28,249
Moreover it happens in every story.

545
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,949
Seth Karorimal's daughter Radha..

546
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:33,649
..always falls in love with a poor boy Kishen.

547
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:37,491
Mother, have you seen the film, Sawan Ko Aane Do?

548
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:40,691
Dear, Ive seen only one film. Mother India.

549
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:43,091
So you've become like Mother India!

550
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:44,994
Daddy, why didnt you show her a romantic film?

551
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,980
Shes watching your film now. Isnt it?

552
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
Whatever happens to your love story..

553
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,480
..the end is bound to take place at Junagadh.

554
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:15,598
Don't leave him!
He's a murderer!

555
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:17,598
Dont free him! No! Get hold of him!

556
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:20,022
Leave me and catch him!

557
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:21,651
Hes committed a murder!

558
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:24,873
Dont talk to me at a high pitch!

559
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,862
I've seen the result
of my leniency with you!

560
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,719
Quarrels and fights everyday

561
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:33,059
Do you realize the meaning of whatever you did..

562
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:35,099
..in front of the police station?

563
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:38,399
Let it be done with. Hes a kid after all.
 You keep quiet!

564
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:41,846
Even you are responsible
for his waywardness

565
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:50,944
Daddy, hes the same man that run down the man.

566
00:41:51,547 --> 00:41:53,047
That man did have a revolver also with him.

567
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:55,751
The police couldn catch him.

568
00:41:56,938 --> 00:41:59,238
One.. a murderer kept openly
roaming on the streets.

569
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:00,438
But your police..

570
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:04,343
Don't teach me police work!

571
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:08,267
Aren't you concerned about my reputation?

572
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:11,467
Dad, I know how concerned
you are about our home and us.

573
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,067
I am aware of it.
- Vishal!

574
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:14,267
Mother, let me speak!

575
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:21,106
Dad, you bother only for
your reputation and name.

576
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:27,337
Look. Look at this picture!
Do you have any relation with it?

577
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,917
Hes your elder son Vikas Chowdhary.

578
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:35,284
Two years back, the police
had found his crushed body.

579
00:42:35,484 --> 00:42:38,184
Calling it an accident,
the police got rid of the case.

580
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:41,867
Dad, tell me. If this was an accident then..

581
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:45,567
.. why couldnt the police trace
the car and the driver?

582
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:47,913
By the way, what police and what law?

583
00:42:48,113 --> 00:42:51,713
When the Police Commissioner couldn't
get justice for his son's death..

584
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:53,513
...what justice can an ordinary
person hope for?

585
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,918
He's your brother afterwards, and our son first!

586
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:03,148
Hes his father! Go! Go away from here!

587
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:13,744
Ive no complaints with you.
No complaints.

588
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:17,643
I understand your difficulty.
Whatever he said..

589
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:22,909
No, Revathy. What Vishal said is right.

590
00:43:25,214 --> 00:43:28,414
It's true that I've separated myself from
this house to quite some extent.

591
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,210
I am never able to give you time.

592
00:43:36,174 --> 00:43:38,674
The situation of this city
is worsening day by day.

593
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:43,883
Some powerfull outlaws are playing
with our law and system.

594
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:50,428
I keep saying that everything's all right.

595
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:52,888
Everything is under control.

596
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,098
Revathy. The truth is that..

597
00:43:57,655 --> 00:44:00,155
..we are gradually losing everything.

598
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,906
Ive got so indulged..

599
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:08,393
..that Ive forgotten my sons demise.

600
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:53,101
Greetings, Mr Chaudhary. Greetings.

601
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:59,199
I could meet you at your office also.

602
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:04,799
But you know that I do everything
outside the law's premises.

603
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:07,799
Khan, good that you meet me outside.

604
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,270
If not, Id not have given
you the chance to speak so.

605
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,520
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has
beaten up my man in open.

606
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
Hes displayed his outlaw skills.

607
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,840
Look. I am aware of whom he beat and why.

608
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,240
Yes, yes. Hes surely not
a priest or a clergyman.

609
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:29,516
Hes a murderer. Murderer.

610
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:33,182
Then issure an arrest warrant
on his name. Issue!

611
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:37,699
Ive never stopped the police. Isnt?

612
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:42,454
Then, itd be only Vishal
to witness int he court, right?

613
00:45:42,654 --> 00:45:43,654
Let's go.

614
00:45:45,936 --> 00:45:50,136
Khan, Ive got some legal limits.

615
00:45:51,254 --> 00:45:54,054
Or else, people like you..
- Should be shot.

616
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:58,069
We should be sprayed with machine gun bullets.

617
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:00,509
Mr. Chaudhary, the idea is nice.

618
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,971
Do keep one thing in mind.

619
00:46:03,171 --> 00:46:07,571
You can say your bad
time is about to arrive..

620
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:09,571
Khan, your days are numbered now.

621
00:46:10,886 --> 00:46:13,486
Maybe, I dont get any proof against you.

622
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,013
The day youll break my tolerance level..

623
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:23,813
..I'll turn you into such a state,
that you'll shed your misconception of being a man.

624
00:46:26,796 --> 00:46:27,396
Lets go.

625
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:35,974
Khan heart says that well together weave a story for sure.

626
00:46:36,174 --> 00:46:37,374
Daddy!
- Shut up!

627
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:41,711
How could you imagine that
you could marry my son?

628
00:46:42,464 --> 00:46:45,864
I think Devki Nandan Sharma
is behind all this

629
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:48,799
He couldnt get promoted int he department.

630
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:52,399
Now he wants to become my in-law
getting his daughter married to my son.

631
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:56,772
My in-law! The in-law of A.C.P.,
a head constable!

632
00:46:56,972 --> 00:46:59,172
Ill get him transferred.

633
00:46:59,892 --> 00:47:01,892
Ill get him sent to Junagadh. Junagadh.

634
00:47:02,092 --> 00:47:05,192
I wont go to Junagadh!
I wont go to Junagadh!

635
00:47:05,392 --> 00:47:06,392
I wont go to Junagadh!

636
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:07,592
Whats wrong with you?

637
00:47:08,664 --> 00:47:12,064
Whether youre awake or asleep,
you keep mentioning Junagadh all the while.

638
00:47:12,942 --> 00:47:15,042
I am afraid its related to
some supernatural force.

639
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:17,278
Get a talisman from the priest.

640
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:20,989
Get a talisman for our daughter. Call her.

641
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:22,289
I want ask her something.

642
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:23,489
She went somewhere in the morning,
looking really happy.

643
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:25,689
She looked very happy today!

644
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:27,727
She looked happy!
- Yes.

645
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:29,664
She was even humming a song.

646
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:32,886
She was even humming a song.

647
00:47:34,026 --> 00:47:35,526
Sing it. Sing it. Which one?

648
00:47:35,726 --> 00:47:39,126
Love is crazy and uncontrolled.

649
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,126
Love is crazy..  Its done.

650
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:44,726
What!
 The transfers done. Its done.

651
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:48,175
Even the letter mustve got typed by now.

652
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:53,809
Only God can save me now! Oh God!

653
00:47:55,353 --> 00:47:57,053
Its the eight Monday. Eight!

654
00:47:57,706 --> 00:48:02,706
People over here say that
the wish comes true in seven.

655
00:48:02,906 --> 00:48:06,506
I thought maybe I committed some
error during one Monday.

656
00:48:06,742 --> 00:48:08,342
Thats the reason
Ive come again today.

657
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:12,151
Moreover Ive not asked for, car,
bungalow jewellery os diamonds from you.

658
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:14,551
Ive asked only for my love.

659
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:18,051
Cant you bestow this happiness to a woman?

660
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:21,551
Look! Youve seen only my devotion.

661
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:23,316
Youve not witnessed my anger.

662
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:29,130
If my wish is not fulfilled,
I'll keep banging my head on this sill

663
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,959
Yes! Ill die banging
my head on this temple.

664
00:48:38,428 --> 00:48:41,628
Ill die but your image shall suffer.

665
00:48:42,228 --> 00:48:45,028
You'll keep pining for all these sweet offerings.

666
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:48,128
Youll crave for it then. Yes!

667
00:48:48,817 --> 00:48:52,417
Enough, enough.. How far would you threaten Him?

668
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:55,591
Whats the matter?
Why are youre so angry with God?

669
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,390
Actually, Mother.. Can I call you Mother?

670
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,690
Yes yes
- Yes.

671
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,890
That, which happens to everyone at this age,..

672
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,020
..has happened to me too.

673
00:49:07,324 --> 00:49:08,024
What!

674
00:49:08,224 --> 00:49:10,224
That which happened to Dimple in 'Bobby'..

675
00:49:10,424 --> 00:49:11,724
..Meena Kumari in Pakheezah.

676
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:14,224
Dear, what but?
 Love, aunt! Love!

677
00:49:14,624 --> 00:49:16,624
Aunt, I am in love with someone.

678
00:49:16,824 --> 00:49:20,324
Isn true that love is sacred?
That love is worship?

679
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,324
Its true? Isnt it, aunt?
 Absolutely true!

680
00:49:23,524 --> 00:49:25,924
Aunt, you too mustve prayed for that.

681
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,567
You pay your attention over here.

682
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:34,767
I felt as if you were to go into a flashback. Yes!

683
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:37,267
So I hope I havent committed any crime by falling in love?

684
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:38,867
No. You havent committed any crime.

685
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,567
Thats what I was telling daddy.

686
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:42,767
He says that I cant marry him..

687
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:45,867
..as the boy is a much higher
status compared to us.

688
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:50,089
Aunt, does love care for
status and social standing?

689
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:52,089
Isn it?
 Not at all.

690
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:53,806
Thats what I was saying.

691
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,424
Can I take support on your shoulders?

692
00:49:56,624 --> 00:49:57,624
Yes, yes. Sure.

693
00:49:57,824 --> 00:50:00,624
At such times one needs shoulders..

694
00:50:00,946 --> 00:50:02,846
..to cry on.

695
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:07,361
Aunt, isnt it that an Indian
woman falls seriously..

696
00:50:07,561 --> 00:50:09,861
..for someone only once in life?

697
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:10,761
Of course!

698
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:14,061
Then how can I marry somebody else?

699
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,261
After all, I am an Indian women, right?

700
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:17,861
Yes, but whos that guy?

701
00:50:18,771 --> 00:50:20,671
Hes the son of A.C.P. Chaudhary.

702
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:25,082
His name is Vishal.
My dad is a head constable.

703
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:26,282
Devki Nandan Sharma.

704
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,824
He says that this marriage cant take place.

705
00:50:29,775 --> 00:50:33,575
Aunt, its got nothing to do with the department
as this problem is related to heart.

706
00:50:36,006 --> 00:50:39,306
Your case is really serious. Come to my home.

707
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:40,606
Everything shall be fine.

708
00:51:16,363 --> 00:51:17,863
Tea without sugar.

709
00:51:18,063 --> 00:51:20,063
I want two spoons of sugar.

710
00:51:23,994 --> 00:51:26,194
Shes our daughter-in-law.
 I see.

711
00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:28,137
Daughter-in-law?

712
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:30,542
Hows she?

713
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:32,687
Shes beautiful for sure.

714
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:35,887
Yes, I always look beautiful
in borrowed clothes.

715
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,280
But..How and when did this happen?

716
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,280
Its Vishals choice. Shes
the daughter of Mr. Devki Nandan.

717
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,580
I see.. Devki Nandan?

718
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,308
Devki Nandan Sharma.
- Yes.

719
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:58,092
Head constable.
- Yes.

720
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:03,486
Yes. I mustve seen her when she was a little child.

721
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:06,686
Yes, very right. Ive played
on your lap. Father was telling me.

722
00:52:09,464 --> 00:52:12,164
Good. Vishal has done a commendable job.

723
00:52:12,814 --> 00:52:15,414
He has eased our burden But where he?

724
00:52:16,923 --> 00:52:21,623
You stupid! Why did you hide our daughter-in law from us?

725
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,722
Then there should be no delay in this. Right?

726
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:31,281
You meet Mr. Devki Nandan and take up the subject.
 Yes.

727
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:35,481
But what can I do? Who should
I explain the things to?

728
00:52:35,681 --> 00:52:36,681
And daughter..

729
00:52:40,025 --> 00:52:40,825
Mr. Sharma.

730
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:42,444
Yes, sir!

731
00:52:42,544 --> 00:52:44,044
Please come here. I want to talk you.

732
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,244
Sir, to me.

733
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:48,344
Yes, you please come here.
Please sit.

734
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:51,873
Not in front. Sit on the rear.

735
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:53,567
Backside!

736
00:52:54,443 --> 00:52:56,543
Yes. Driver, take us towards the headquarters.

737
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:07,081
Mr. Devki Nandan, I didnt expect this from you.

738
00:53:07,346 --> 00:53:11,546
That youll such..
 I'll be transferred now!

739
00:53:12,036 --> 00:53:13,736
Think that you're already transferred.

740
00:53:15,174 --> 00:53:19,174
Sir, I am not at fault in this.
I did explain to her a lot.

741
00:53:19,374 --> 00:53:20,574
But she wouldn' listen.

742
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:25,248
I told the fool about positions between the two of us..

743
00:53:25,574 --> 00:53:28,074
I scolded her, rebuked her..

744
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:29,874
I warn you if you say anything to her!

745
00:53:30,504 --> 00:53:32,404
Shes to become our daughter-in-law.

746
00:53:34,436 --> 00:53:35,536
Daughter-in-law?

747
00:53:38,984 --> 00:53:40,784
Then we have become in-laws.

748
00:54:20,638 --> 00:54:25,138
From where should I begin the love?

749
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:28,776
I wont let you begin it.

750
00:54:31,743 --> 00:54:34,043
From where should I begin the love?

751
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:39,231
Theres no spot free as theres eye-liner
and the make-up elsewhere.

752
00:54:39,431 --> 00:54:44,731
Theres no spot free as theres eye-liner
and the make-up elsewhere.

753
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:50,031
Do let me know of what I should be doing.

754
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,090
I wont let you begin it.

755
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:01,439
I wont let you begin it.

756
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:06,739
The skirt, the bangles, the ear-ring
the eye-liner and the make up.

757
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:09,739
 They guard me all the time.

758
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,139
They look after me.

759
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:17,573
I am scared of your intentions.

760
00:55:21,129 --> 00:55:23,629
From where should I begin the love?

761
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:29,042
I wont let you begin it.

762
00:55:57,266 --> 00:56:02,566
Promising and then not fulfilling it.

763
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:13,098
Promising and then not fulfilling it.

764
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:18,686
You make me crazy by cracking up dialogues.

765
00:56:18,886 --> 00:56:21,086
To make me feel impatient.

766
00:56:21,286 --> 00:56:24,186
Youve happened to call me here.

767
00:56:24,386 --> 00:56:26,686
Give me love now.

768
00:56:26,886 --> 00:56:29,386
Let me know where you have hidden it.

769
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:34,086
"I am extremely impatient about it.

770
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,240
From where should I begin the love?

771
00:56:43,284 --> 00:56:45,784
I wont let you begin it.

772
00:57:18,984 --> 00:57:24,284
How do I tell you about the love spot?

773
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:34,946
How do I tell you about the love spot?

774
00:57:35,146 --> 00:57:40,346
Youre a nave and I am a minor

775
00:57:40,546 --> 00:57:45,746
Beloved, the heartbeats
never get separated.

776
00:57:45,946 --> 00:57:51,046
Ill give away my heart
to you, I swear on love.

777
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:56,246
You nave! Begin
the love from the heart.

778
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,951
From where should I begin the love?

779
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,048
Begin it from the heart.

780
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:12,148
The skirt, the bangles, the ear-ring
the eye-liner and the make up.

781
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:14,948
 They guard me all the time.

782
00:58:15,348 --> 00:58:17,848
They look after me.

783
00:58:18,048 --> 00:58:22,648
I apply make up only for you.

784
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:28,768
From where should I begin the love?

785
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:34,169
Begin it from the heart.

786
00:58:39,297 --> 00:58:43,397
Mana Shetty has trespasses my
region by collecting the weekly tax.

787
00:58:44,724 --> 00:58:50,324
Today its Teen Batti, then Golwaldi
and then Kali Chowki.

788
00:58:51,478 --> 00:58:53,278
He'll try to usurp every place.

789
00:58:54,869 --> 00:59:00,069
This is not a matter of money,
but the weights of our names!

790
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:05,052
Baba Khan. Mana Shetty. Reputation.
You understand the reputation of a name?

791
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:18,233
I could have sent this money through somebody.

792
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:25,054
But I thought the time has arrived
that we talk face to face.

793
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:34,741
I'm returning this money because I had called you "Boss " once.

794
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:37,541
..I had called you "Boss " once.

795
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:42,141
IYou had given me food and shelter once.

796
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:44,541
Thats what youre returning to me now.

797
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:48,071
Shetty, when I was sheltering you,..

798
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:53,043
..I never knew you'd bite me one day.

799
00:59:53,243 --> 00:59:55,743
Brother Khan, in our profession, people are not sheltered,..

800
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,926
..but kept like revolvers.

801
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:01,095
For your food,..

802
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:02,595
..I had to face death so many times.

803
01:00:03,356 --> 01:00:06,956
It was all done by me until yesterday
and the name was that of yours.

804
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:10,956
Today, its my name and my movement.

805
01:00:11,156 --> 01:00:15,056
By infringing on one region of mine, you think
youve become equal to me?

806
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:20,356
Shetty, one day you'll again have to wear
my collar around your neck!

807
01:00:20,556 --> 01:00:24,256
Mr. Khan, your collar will turn out
to be too small for my neck now

808
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:29,481
If I want to, I can dethrone you at once.

809
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,120
In politics and crime..

810
01:00:32,592 --> 01:00:35,292
..if theres no opposition, then theres no movement.

811
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:42,430
Brother Khan, we both are aware of one fact.

812
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,630
He rules in this profession,
who is the most powerful.

813
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:56,869
Punnu, you start killing each and every man of his.

814
01:01:57,206 --> 01:02:00,706
Shetty, you forced me to start this game.

815
01:02:00,906 --> 01:02:08,706
Prepare yourself to perform the last rites of all your men.

816
01:02:08,906 --> 01:02:13,306
Brother Khan, if you tonsure a dead man he doesnt become alive.

817
01:02:13,645 --> 01:02:18,045
The movement of Mana Shetty doesnt
get blocked by killing a couple of his men.

818
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,640
Nobody move!

819
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,440
I can get your movement blocked right away.

820
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:30,156
Youd once saved my life.

821
01:02:31,509 --> 01:02:34,709
By leaving you today I've repaid your debt

822
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,933
Moreover its important that you stay alive.

823
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:41,543
So that I can explain...

824
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,561
.. to you the meaning if rivalry and power!

825
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:57,401
Hello.
- Can I talk to the comissioner?

826
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:01,101
Hes asleep. He returned late at night.

827
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:03,501
Where had he gone?
 Hed gone to some party.

828
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:06,701
Oh! He must be very tired, right?

829
01:03:08,299 --> 01:03:11,199
Alright. Ill call up later.

830
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:22,147
This operation is undoubtedly
difficult, but well succeed.

831
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:27,047
Well try to get them caught alive.

832
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:32,590
Punnu Jadiya has mentioned these names in his statement.

833
01:03:34,135 --> 01:03:37,335
They are very dangerous and adept criminals.

834
01:03:38,198 --> 01:03:42,798
These people are hiding in this part of Chembur
as per the report from constable Salvi.

835
01:03:42,998 --> 01:03:45,998
And Pandey from barricade 7 and 11.

836
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,200
Vijay.
 Yes, sir.

837
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,000
Barricade this area..

838
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,100
..and start searching it!
 Right, sir.

839
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,500
Check properly at every liquor spot, motels, hotels..

840
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,700
..restaurants, shops, clubs and casinos.

841
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:18,199
Whats the position now?

842
01:04:18,399 --> 01:04:20,299
Sir, the place is found locked over there..

843
01:04:20,499 --> 01:04:21,599
.. of which we had the information.

844
01:04:26,294 --> 01:04:27,294
Vijay Singh.
 Yes, sir.

845
01:04:28,105 --> 01:04:29,905
You be in contact of Gupte.
 Yes, sir.

846
01:04:30,105 --> 01:04:32,305
Keep giving me the information about 7,3 and 2.
- OK, sir!

847
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:41,294
Break this lock.
 Yes, sir.

848
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,160
Move, Thakur! Move aside!

849
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:29,579
Move aside! Move aside!

850
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:40,932
Get aside!

851
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:01,369
Get aside!

852
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:16,038
Khan! Vijay, call the ambulance immediately!

853
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:29,707
Mr. Chaudhary! Its not a trivial issue.

854
01:06:30,225 --> 01:06:32,525
Its the result of your zeal and ignorance.

855
01:06:32,725 --> 01:06:37,125
I do know. I do know that has happened.

856
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:42,936
I am sorry, but I know my job better than you.

857
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:45,736
Mr. Chaudhary!
 Dont suppress my voice!

858
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:47,804
Please dont suppress my voice!

859
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,004
The whole city is sinking in murder and violence.

860
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:54,481
If a man is late in returning home,..

861
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:57,584
..his family prays for his life.

862
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,270
It might be a case of pride you..

863
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,350
..but its a matter of shame for me.

864
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:06,108
Thats because I do care
for my position and duty.

865
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:10,598
I was fighting their bullets
with my men when..

866
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:14,630
..you were trying to get over
with last nights hangover.

867
01:07:15,882 --> 01:07:18,682
I shouldnt have done this.
I shouldnt have done that.

868
01:07:18,882 --> 01:07:23,082
I shouldnt have gone to the function
and encouraged the children.

869
01:07:23,429 --> 01:07:27,429
You should go and inaugurate the beauty parlour.

870
01:07:27,629 --> 01:07:29,529
You should go to film premieres and..

871
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:32,629
..get your photos clicked with
the heroes and heroines!

872
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:36,029
Mr. Chaudhary! Its my personal life!

873
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:39,409
Youve no idea of what loss you can incur..

874
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,490
..due to the operation getting flopped.

875
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:42,990
Then what would you do?

876
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:48,274
Youll get me transferred?
Please do so!

877
01:07:48,574 --> 01:07:50,274
I don't care!

878
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:52,474
Sir, Iqbal Khan is dead.

879
01:07:56,212 --> 01:07:56,912
What?

880
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:09,321
Have courage.

881
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:13,809
The police force is with you in this crisis of yours.

882
01:08:25,295 --> 01:08:27,095
Mr. Chaudhary!
- No photographs please.

883
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,258
Mr. Chaudhary, what could be the reason of
the police failing int he operation?

884
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:35,858
Were 20 policemen not
enough to nab 4 criminals?

885
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,758
Is it that they had better weapons than yours?

886
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,558
Give me a chance to speak if you want the answers.

887
01:08:40,758 --> 01:08:43,658
At what distance were you when Iqbal got shot?

888
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:45,058
What do you mean?

889
01:08:45,258 --> 01:08:49,058
Mr. Chaudhary, is true that the police
ran away fearing their bullets?

890
01:08:52,323 --> 01:08:54,523
Look at him! Look at him closely.

891
01:08:56,179 --> 01:09:00,779
What do you think? Did he sacrifice his life
for 1419 rupees and 70 paise?

892
01:09:00,879 --> 01:09:01,479
No!

893
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,100
He died doing his duty dutifully.

894
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:09,676
Why? Why cant you people see all this?

895
01:09:10,553 --> 01:09:13,753
You can see only our drawbacks!
Not our sacrifices!

896
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:19,039
Ask the child!
Ask him what he has lost!

897
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,080
Ask his wife of what she has lost!

898
01:09:23,643 --> 01:09:27,443
Ask his old father what he has lost!

899
01:09:28,537 --> 01:09:31,037
You people only know to make issues!

900
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:34,910
Sorry!

901
01:09:37,585 --> 01:09:38,585
Please breathe!

902
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:47,870
Mr. Chaudhary, you shouldnt be
tense in this situation.

903
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:50,691
You need complete rest.

904
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:53,679
What's wrong with me after all?

905
01:09:53,879 --> 01:09:56,679
You doctors!
 Please agree on some issues.

906
01:09:56,879 --> 01:09:58,179
That too when the doctor says no.

907
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,320
Alright. Ill make a move then.

908
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,120
Thank you, doctor!

909
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:07,451
Hello.
 Vishal, handover to father.

910
01:10:07,651 --> 01:10:09,251
Sure, just a moment. Father, its your phone call.

911
01:10:11,604 --> 01:10:13,004
Hello.
 Vijay here, sir.

912
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:15,004
Tell me, Vijay.
 Sir, my doubt proved to be correct.

913
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:16,504
Thakur is involved with them.

914
01:10:16,704 --> 01:10:18,404
Are you sure?
 Yes, sir.

915
01:10:18,604 --> 01:10:20,704
We failed in that operation due to him, sir.

916
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,301
Suddenly he came in front of me and
gave them a chance to flee.

917
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:28,799
Where have you placed him? 
Right now hes here. In my office.

918
01:10:29,278 --> 01:10:31,978
Alright. Bring him to my office.

919
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:34,349
I'll be arriving right now.
 Right, sir.

920
01:10:35,424 --> 01:10:38,924
Is it necessary for you to go in this condition?
 Yes, Revathy.

921
01:10:39,124 --> 01:10:42,524
Dad, when the doctor has asked you not to..
 No, son.

922
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,930
How can I lie ont he bed at this juncture?

923
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,670
The whole city is observing our
police department right now.

924
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:51,094
Ok, Revathy!

925
01:10:54,814 --> 01:10:55,814
Sir.

926
01:10:56,014 --> 01:10:57,514
Where is he?
 Right in front.

927
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:07,816
Please, sir! I made a mistake.
Please forgive me!

928
01:11:08,016 --> 01:11:09,516
Please forgive me!

929
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:13,412
Youve got our department
stained in a way..

930
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:17,874
..that cant be washed away with any number
of sacrifices like that of Khans.

931
01:11:21,939 --> 01:11:23,739
Please, sir! Please forgive me!

932
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:26,239
You've insulted the policeman's uniform!

933
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:29,815
Youve ruined its dignity!
 Sir, I wont repeat it!

934
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,730
Take him to the hospital.

935
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,292
Its like an acid!

936
01:11:54,348 --> 01:11:55,248
Sharad.
 Yes.

937
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,490
Get the consignment delivered at the warehouse.
- Fine, brother Khan.

938
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:01,871
Speak, doctor.
 Look!

939
01:12:02,687 --> 01:12:05,387
I cant kill him! I am a doctor.

940
01:12:06,494 --> 01:12:08,194
I cant kill him!

941
01:12:08,294 --> 01:12:11,394
Dr. Vikas Chaudhary had
refused me int he same way.

942
01:12:12,052 --> 01:12:15,452
The police had to collect the pieces of his corpse for his identification!

943
01:12:15,552 --> 01:12:16,752
It was you that killed Vikas..

944
01:12:16,852 --> 01:12:20,552
Yes Id got him killed. Doctor, youll kill Thakur.

945
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:25,452
Or I'll do both the identification
and post-mortem of your corpse

946
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:29,290
Look! What would happen to
my career spanning 15 years?

947
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:31,269
If it gets disclosed, then my job..

948
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:36,969
Doctor, if you dont kill Thakur, then my men are ever ready..

949
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:43,095
..to kill and get themselves killed at my behest.

950
01:13:02,084 --> 01:13:03,484
Nothing will happen to you doktor.

951
01:13:05,143 --> 01:13:07,643
A woman is called a whore only if she's caught.

952
01:13:09,143 --> 01:13:12,243
The post-mortem report will show that
Thakur died, not because of you..

953
01:13:13,966 --> 01:13:16,266
..but due to Chaudhary's blows!

954
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:20,367
Hello! Hello. Bombay Times?

955
01:13:21,227 --> 01:13:23,027
Yes, I am press reporter Saxena speaking.

956
01:13:23,818 --> 01:13:25,618
Note a headline for tomorrows issue.

957
01:13:25,924 --> 01:13:30,124
The sub-inspector has died,
who was beaten-up by A.C.P. Chaudhary.

958
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:31,324
A.C.P. Chaudhary kills Inspector!

959
01:13:31,524 --> 01:13:35,024
Give me one!
 Here..Inspectors death..

960
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:46,377
Chaudhary, you finally killed my husband!

961
01:13:46,749 --> 01:13:48,449
Youve killed him finally!
- Constable.

962
01:13:48,849 --> 01:13:51,649
Why did you do this? Why?

963
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:53,949
Why weren't you shot dead?

964
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,871
Youve killed my husband! Why? Answer me!

965
01:13:57,071 --> 01:14:00,171
How will I bring up my children? How?

966
01:14:00,671 --> 01:14:02,771
From where will I bring food for them?

967
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:06,171
What will I do? Tell me! What will I do!

968
01:14:06,604 --> 01:14:08,404
Lets go.
- Answer me, Chaudhary!

969
01:14:08,604 --> 01:14:09,604
What do I do?

970
01:14:16,237 --> 01:14:17,437
Mother! Mother!

971
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:12,050
Let the eyes talk.

972
01:15:14,671 --> 01:15:20,171
Let the eyes talk.

973
01:15:20,371 --> 01:15:27,171
That what I couldnt say..

974
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:33,271

975
01:15:33,471 --> 01:15:39,671

Let the eyes talk.

981
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:13,771
The eyes.

982
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:59,547
The earth and sky.
The waves and the ocean.

983
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:06,029
The earth and sky.
The waves and the ocean.

984
01:17:06,782 --> 01:17:12,882
"They speak the language of love.

Let the eyes.."

1010
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:30,949
Vishal, what are you thinking about?

1011
01:20:31,686 --> 01:20:32,586
Nothing.

1012
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:39,835
I am unable to think.
I'm seeing everything!

1013
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,760
I am not sure what else Ive got to see.

1014
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:46,792
Everything..Vishal, everything shall be fine.

1015
01:20:47,465 --> 01:20:51,165
Uncle will return home,
and everything will be like before.

1016
01:20:51,443 --> 01:20:53,343
Why am I not able to convince myself about this?

1017
01:20:53,805 --> 01:20:57,705
Why do I feel that its the beginning of some war?

1018
01:20:58,252 --> 01:20:59,352
Vishal!
- Yes!

1019
01:21:00,054 --> 01:21:00,954
I feel as..

1020
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:05,929
..if I have placed my feet on a marsh I am sinking.

1021
01:21:06,706 --> 01:21:07,806
That I am drowning!
 Vishal!

1022
01:21:08,749 --> 01:21:09,949
I am drowning!

1023
01:21:12,437 --> 01:21:14,537
Who all were present..

1024
01:21:15,122 --> 01:21:17,322
..when Chaudhary hit Thakur? Their statement?

1025
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:20,467
Sir, they too have mentioned
of Thakur getting beaten up.

1026
01:21:20,845 --> 01:21:22,945
Even the post-mortem reports have revealed that..

1027
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:25,845
..its the injuries that killed him.
 Ok.

1028
01:21:27,264 --> 01:21:30,764
Dr. Gokhale, have you prepared Thakurs medical report?

1029
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:34,166
Yes, sir. Ive put those papers in this file.

1030
01:21:34,949 --> 01:21:37,449
Mr. Thakur didnt have any such disease.

1031
01:21:38,151 --> 01:21:40,651
I see! Hows Chaudhary feeling now?

1032
01:21:40,765 --> 01:21:42,665
He'll have to be in hospital for a few more days.

1033
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:45,304
Good evening, sir.
I am Shetty speaking.

1034
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:47,335
Yes, Shetty. Whats the matter?

1035
01:21:47,797 --> 01:21:51,797
Sir, one can understand if a goon kills a goon.

1036
01:21:52,303 --> 01:21:56,303
I couldnt understand a police
personnel being killed by another.

1037
01:21:56,401 --> 01:22:00,001
Yes, but why are you
so worried about this?

1038
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:02,378
Sir, nothing at all.

1039
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:05,439
This matter is being discussed by the entire city.

1040
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:07,970
Sir, we have got to keep an eye.

1041
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:10,805
The police keep an eye
on us and vice-versa.

1042
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,343
Do let me know if I can
serve you in any way.

1043
01:22:18,499 --> 01:22:20,799
Yes.
 I want to meet Mr. Chaudhary.

1044
01:22:20,926 --> 01:22:24,226
We have the orders from our seniors
that nobody can meet him.

1045
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:25,003
What do you say?

1046
01:22:25,548 --> 01:22:27,548
I am his son. Nobody can stop me.

1047
01:22:27,745 --> 01:22:33,145
Look, I can ever arrest you if
you force. Thats why..

1048
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:40,833
Hello, Vishal. What brought you here?

1049
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:46,689
Uncle, why am I not allowed
to meet my father?

1050
01:22:46,722 --> 01:22:50,622
You dont understand that hes been admitted in
the hospital as hes not keeping well.

1051
01:22:51,027 --> 01:22:53,727
The doctors say that he shouldnt be
allowed to meet anybody.

1052
01:22:54,659 --> 01:23:00,159
Son, Thakur's death has affected his mental balance.

1053
01:23:00,197 --> 01:23:01,897
But Thakur's death might have been an accident.

1054
01:23:02,193 --> 01:23:04,093
Ill be the happiest man
if Mr. Chaudhary happens..

1055
01:23:04,535 --> 01:23:06,235
..to get released from this case.

1056
01:23:06,799 --> 01:23:09,499
And our department will also
escape from a big disgrace.

1057
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:12,461
Defame!
 You dont bother yourself.

1058
01:23:12,895 --> 01:23:14,395
Everything will be fine in a couple of days.

1059
01:23:26,582 --> 01:23:27,482
Vishal, what happened?

1060
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:37,309
Hes fine I guess.

1061
01:23:38,282 --> 01:23:39,882
Till when will he be kept in hospital?

1062
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:41,582
Mother, I wasnt allowed to meet daddy!

1063
01:23:41,782 --> 01:23:42,482
Why?

1064
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,920
Vishal, you meet Desai and
talk to him at least!

1065
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,620
I meet Mr. Desai! He..

1066
01:23:51,249 --> 01:23:53,849
He doesnt bother about father, but his department!

1067
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:55,969
He was saying that everything will be fine!

1068
01:23:56,563 --> 01:23:58,463
Mother, I dont see anything right.

1069
01:23:58,915 --> 01:24:00,015
Everything is getting entangled!

1070
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:05,879
I don't understand who wants to do what with Daddy!

1071
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:19,234
Brother Khan, you say.
What do we do about Chaudhary?

1072
01:24:20,338 --> 01:24:22,738
I can fight case both ways.

1073
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,840
I hope youre getting what I am saying.

1074
01:24:27,685 --> 01:24:31,585
I can get Chaudhary awarded a life
imprisonment for Thakurs death.

1075
01:24:38,734 --> 01:24:40,834
And I can also prove him to be mad.

1076
01:24:41,336 --> 01:24:42,536
You tell me what to do.

1077
01:24:44,131 --> 01:24:45,631
Tell me about everything
you require for this case..

1078
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,190
..also of the papers that
I want from other offices.

1079
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:53,661
Ill manage things outside the court.

1080
01:24:54,841 --> 01:24:56,441
You manage the inside proceedings.

1081
01:25:19,955 --> 01:25:22,955
Doctor, take proper care of Chaudhary.

1082
01:25:38,122 --> 01:25:39,122
Ive seen the file.

1083
01:25:40,123 --> 01:25:41,923
There are many difficulties in this case.

1084
01:25:42,723 --> 01:25:45,023
Still Ill try.
 Do anything, advocate.

1085
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,523
Some way has to come out.

1086
01:25:47,918 --> 01:25:49,318
Well be very grateful to you.

1087
01:25:52,974 --> 01:25:53,974
I am Khan speaking.

1088
01:26:07,089 --> 01:26:09,789
Alright. Fine. Ill manage.

1089
01:26:13,092 --> 01:26:16,492
Look. Nothing can be done in this case.

1090
01:26:17,183 --> 01:26:18,583
Its a very weak case.

1091
01:26:19,432 --> 01:26:23,632
No lawyer would like to take up this case.

1092
01:26:23,832 --> 01:26:28,032
Why do you say so? You know legal procedures.

1093
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,960
It's your profession.

1094
01:26:30,692 --> 01:26:32,092
Please get him released for now.

1095
01:26:32,865 --> 01:26:34,465
Well then fight the case on our own.

1096
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:37,206
Hes not even keeping well these days.

1097
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:41,377
He can be given proper
attention if hes at home.

1098
01:26:43,133 --> 01:26:46,133
II beg of you!

1099
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:47,633
No, mother! No!

1100
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,633
Look. I do understand your problem.

1101
01:26:51,184 --> 01:26:54,384
I cant do anything in it.
Please forgive me.

1102
01:26:54,778 --> 01:26:57,578
Mother, lets go.
Theres no hope over here.

1103
01:26:58,268 --> 01:26:59,268
Theres no hope over here.

1104
01:27:02,672 --> 01:27:03,472
Hello!

1105
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:09,819
Who are you?
 I am Peter Dcosta.

1106
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,520
Do you have any Shakespeare book?

1107
01:27:17,514 --> 01:27:18,814
What!
 Shakespeare!

1108
01:27:19,014 --> 01:27:22,414
Any book! Please lend me,
Ill return after reading it.

1109
01:27:22,914 --> 01:27:25,814
You have come to a wrong place. Please go.

1110
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:31,010
Lett hat aside. I am articulate. Isnt it!

1111
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:33,810
My speech is very good.

1112
01:27:34,919 --> 01:27:36,319
Do you feel from my speech

1113
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:42,019
..am I Peter Dcosta? No! No!

1114
01:27:42,219 --> 01:27:47,219
Actually I am not Peter Dcosta!
Yusuf Khurram!

1115
01:27:47,419 --> 01:27:49,719
My name is Yusuf Khurram.
- Constable.

1116
01:27:51,075 --> 01:27:54,575
Kamat! Were you sleeping?

1117
01:27:55,623 --> 01:27:57,123
Go and call someone.

1118
01:27:57,453 --> 01:27:59,053
So that he can take him to the right place.

1119
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:03,510
Cigarette! You dont smoke this brand?

1120
01:28:07,466 --> 01:28:08,966
Can I use your match box?

1121
01:28:16,869 --> 01:28:17,569
Thank you.

1122
01:28:22,689 --> 01:28:24,589
My cigarette has fallen on the floor! Leave me!

1123
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:27,189
Wheres my cigarette!
Wheres my cigarette!

1124
01:28:27,389 --> 01:28:28,689
The cigarette is so costly!
My cigarette!

1125
01:28:29,753 --> 01:28:30,653
Take away this lunatic.

1126
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:34,111
Leave me! Leave! Leave!

1127
01:28:34,311 --> 01:28:37,411
Please get my cigarette
sent to room no.10 if you find it.

1128
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:39,011
My cigarette is lying there!

1129
01:28:39,224 --> 01:28:41,624
Doctor! Doctor, please do something!

1130
01:28:42,124 --> 01:28:45,624
Please save my child!
Hell die if he doesnt get blood!

1131
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,224
Don't trouble me!

1132
01:28:47,424 --> 01:28:48,824
The blood will be transfused
only when its available.

1133
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:49,724
Please be seated!

1134
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:52,924
Doctor, my child will die!
Please save him!

1135
01:28:53,124 --> 01:28:55,524
Oh no! What kind of crazy woman are you?
Please be seated!

1136
01:28:55,724 --> 01:28:58,724
Doctor, is this the way to talk?

1137
01:28:59,732 --> 01:29:01,232
Please explain to her understand properly.

1138
01:29:03,946 --> 01:29:06,746
You please be seated.
Hes making the arrangements.

1139
01:29:07,683 --> 01:29:08,583
PLease sit.

1140
01:29:09,935 --> 01:29:13,435
Mr. Chaudhary, let me introduce you to them.

1141
01:29:13,734 --> 01:29:17,534
Dr. Rastogi, Dr. Gupte, Dr. Sahay..

1142
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:20,550
..and dr. Khan right in front of you.

1143
01:29:22,249 --> 01:29:22,949
Hello.

1144
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,139
What prank you think you people are playing?

1145
01:29:39,334 --> 01:29:41,534
This man had entered my room yesterday as a lunatic.

1146
01:29:43,171 --> 01:29:48,071
Dcosta! After that Khurram..

1147
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:51,799
..now hes become Dr. Khan!

1148
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,000
Relax Mr. Chaudhary.
Relax. Please have some water.

1149
01:29:56,202 --> 01:29:57,202
I dont want to have water!

1150
01:29:57,448 --> 01:30:00,248
Mr. Chaudhary, you just asked for water.

1151
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:03,524
When did I ask for water?

1152
01:30:04,082 --> 01:30:07,182
You refused for coffee
and asked water instead.

1153
01:30:07,514 --> 01:30:08,414
What nonsense!

1154
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,804
Didnt I say that I didnt ask for water?

1155
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:16,268
When was I offered coffee?

1156
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:19,961
You can see as Ms. Rubina is
still standing with the coffee.

1157
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:32,188
This woman was fighting with this doctor yesterday.

1158
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:34,251
To get her child the blood transfused.

1159
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,500
What's all this?

1160
01:30:37,762 --> 01:30:39,762
Am I being tried upon to become insane?

1161
01:30:41,563 --> 01:30:43,263
Am I being subjected to some kind of fun?

1162
01:30:45,247 --> 01:30:47,347
Ill not spare anyone of you.

1163
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:51,041
Youre all an accomplice in this conspiracy.

1164
01:30:52,309 --> 01:30:55,909
You'll suffer for this!
I am saying it!

1165
01:30:56,777 --> 01:30:58,877
Boys, take him to his room.

1166
01:30:59,959 --> 01:31:00,959
Shut up.

1167
01:31:03,638 --> 01:31:05,338
Leave me! Leave me!

1168
01:31:06,025 --> 01:31:10,425
I am saying I dont
want this injection!

1169
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,370
I can sleep even without it!
Leave me!

1170
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:15,970
What's going on? Leave him.
Please leave him.

1171
01:31:16,552 --> 01:31:18,052
You dont have any idea of who he is!

1172
01:31:18,415 --> 01:31:21,815
Commissioner. Mr. Chaudhary.

1173
01:31:28,437 --> 01:31:29,737
Greetings, Mr. Chaudhary.

1174
01:31:29,937 --> 01:31:32,337
Khan! You!
 Yes, its me.

1175
01:31:33,089 --> 01:31:36,689
I knew that there will be a story with you.

1176
01:31:37,585 --> 01:31:40,285
I got Thakur killed in the hospital.

1177
01:31:42,446 --> 01:31:43,046
What!

1178
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:47,182
You got Thakur murdered?
 Yes.

1179
01:31:48,565 --> 01:31:50,565
You did have great pride over your law.

1180
01:31:51,335 --> 01:31:55,235
Now, Baba Khan will get
unveil your the law's real nature!

1181
01:31:56,204 --> 01:32:00,904
Ill prove that the law is governed by me.

1182
01:32:02,474 --> 01:32:05,474
I wont only be proved in the court
that you killed Thakur..

1183
01:32:07,582 --> 01:32:11,782
..but itll also be proved that youre cynical and mad.

1184
01:32:11,982 --> 01:32:14,382
Baba Khan! Leave me!

1185
01:32:21,037 --> 01:32:23,837
Chaudhary, this hot temper got you ruined.

1186
01:32:24,614 --> 01:32:27,214
I couldve got you killed
like your elder son.

1187
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:33,282
But instead of killing you, I want to make
you retire like a lame horse!

1188
01:32:37,304 --> 01:32:40,604
Youre the murderer of my son?

1189
01:32:42,715 --> 01:32:44,515
You killed my son?

1190
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:48,115
I ordered Mana Shetty
to crush him under a vehicle.

1191
01:32:48,288 --> 01:32:50,088
I got him killed.

1192
01:32:50,684 --> 01:32:54,284
Like you, even he was
fascinated by uprightness.

1193
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:58,769
A fake report was to be made and he refused.
 You swine!

1194
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:05,580
You ruined my life and my career! Ill..

1195
01:33:06,632 --> 01:33:10,432
Chaudhary, your health doesnt
permit you to get angry.

1196
01:33:11,381 --> 01:33:14,481
Administer the injection to him.
He needs rest.

1197
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:17,851
Youve even got to reach
to the court tomorrow.

1198
01:33:17,865 --> 01:33:20,265
Khan, your end has arrived!

1199
01:33:22,103 --> 01:33:27,903
You cant ruin the truth of law by bribing a few officials.

1200
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:35,201
The truth is always safe under the roof of law.

1201
01:33:36,553 --> 01:33:41,153
Khan, your joy of victory wont last for long.

1202
01:33:42,082 --> 01:33:47,482
Khan, I hope youre listening? Khan, I hope youre listening?

1203
01:33:47,933 --> 01:33:48,733
You..

1204
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,780
You honour, Ive been doing my duty
honestly for the past 25 years.

1205
01:33:59,744 --> 01:34:03,944
I've risked my life innumerable
times for the sake of duty.

1206
01:34:04,428 --> 01:34:08,628
Ive faced dangers several times.
endangering myself.

1207
01:34:10,519 --> 01:34:15,719
Your honour, look at this.
Look. The marks of bullets.

1208
01:34:16,219 --> 01:34:17,319
Its a proof to that.

1209
01:34:17,719 --> 01:34:22,319
My Lord, we are not here
to ascertain what..

1210
01:34:22,519 --> 01:34:24,619
..Mr. Chaudhary has done for his department.

1211
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:27,726
I do agree that hes done
a few commendable jobs.

1212
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,360
Hes shown exemplary feats
of courage and bravery.

1213
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:34,968
But even these events
pertain to the period..

1214
01:34:35,288 --> 01:34:37,588
..when he was mentally perfectly fit.

1215
01:34:38,084 --> 01:34:40,784
Unfortunately, for a couple of years..

1216
01:34:40,982 --> 01:34:45,582
..hes mentally imbalanced
since his son died.

1217
01:34:45,642 --> 01:34:48,642
Its a lie! Its wrong!
My dad is being plotted against!

1218
01:34:48,982 --> 01:34:50,182
You please be seated.

1219
01:34:50,453 --> 01:34:52,453
Do not interfere in the
proceedings of the court.

1220
01:34:53,085 --> 01:34:54,585
Vishal! Please!
 But..

1221
01:34:58,585 --> 01:35:04,085
My Lord, in a way, the police department got..

1222
01:35:04,338 --> 01:35:07,638
..saved from getting stained.

1223
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:11,036
Else something worse
could have happened.

1224
01:35:11,619 --> 01:35:14,919
Your honour, I am saying I am not
responsible for Thakurs death.

1225
01:35:15,569 --> 01:35:18,069
I want to say a few more things to the court.

1226
01:35:21,097 --> 01:35:21,797
But..

1227
01:35:21,803 --> 01:35:26,103
My Lord, Mr. Chaudhary has been committing
a few mistakes earlier also.

1228
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:27,858
Nobody paid any heed to those.

1229
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:33,140
But recently without any precise plan,
he took 20 policemen..

1230
01:35:34,403 --> 01:35:38,703
.. and clashed with dangerous criminals at a public place.

1231
01:35:39,481 --> 01:35:46,481
He didnt even feel the need to take advise
from the commissioner, Mr. Desai.

1232
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:51,339
Not only that, but he shot
at public place due..

1233
01:35:51,638 --> 01:35:55,938
..to which two people got injured and are
still under treatment.

1234
01:35:56,394 --> 01:36:01,494
And the young constable Khan also died in this mishap.

1235
01:36:02,759 --> 01:36:05,059
His ferocity crossed its limits..

1236
01:36:05,534 --> 01:36:08,934
..when he beat to death sub-inspector Thakur.

1237
01:36:09,729 --> 01:36:11,529
Inspector Sharma was present there when he..

1238
01:36:11,647 --> 01:36:13,147
..was beating up Thakur.

1239
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,920
Id like to have the permission
to call him as a witness.

1240
01:36:17,103 --> 01:36:18,003
Permission granted.

1241
01:36:19,364 --> 01:36:22,364
Inspector Sharma, were you present there..

1242
01:36:22,564 --> 01:36:26,064
..when Mr. Chaudhary merciressly
was thrashing Thakur?

1243
01:36:26,296 --> 01:36:29,096
Yes. I was present.

1244
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:34,369
But Thakur wasnt hit to the extent
that he could die.

1245
01:36:36,342 --> 01:36:39,142
I feel theres another reason of Thakurs death.

1246
01:36:40,415 --> 01:36:42,615
I am not asking you what you feel.

1247
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:44,315
Please say what you did see.

1248
01:36:44,515 --> 01:36:45,615
You get my point I guess.

1249
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:49,169
What was the need to take Thakur to the..

1250
01:36:49,369 --> 01:36:51,669
..hospital if he wasnt beaten up to that extreme?

1251
01:36:52,069 --> 01:36:55,369
You do agree I guess that you too felt the..

1252
01:36:55,569 --> 01:36:57,669
..need to take him to the hospital
seeing his condition?

1253
01:36:58,471 --> 01:37:00,071
Yes.
- You may go now.

1254
01:37:00,643 --> 01:37:04,243
My lord, I've put the entire case before the court.

1255
01:37:04,443 --> 01:37:07,543
Ive even presented the medical report of Mr. Chaudhary..

1256
01:37:07,743 --> 01:37:09,743
..that Dr. Thakker has prepared.

1257
01:37:09,943 --> 01:37:11,143
Which has - Enough!

1258
01:37:12,429 --> 01:37:13,929
Enough of this drama!

1259
01:37:14,888 --> 01:37:17,188
Stop it now! Stop it!

1260
01:37:19,682 --> 01:37:22,482
Mylord! The report is a false one.

1261
01:37:22,796 --> 01:37:25,496
Dr. Thakker too is a liar! Hes been bribed.

1262
01:37:25,991 --> 01:37:27,291
They all have been bribed!

1263
01:37:27,827 --> 01:37:31,127
I was continuously tried upon to make me
go insane int hat hospital.

1264
01:37:32,112 --> 01:37:34,912
One face was presented to me in two ways.

1265
01:37:35,379 --> 01:37:38,079
Firstly, a lunatic enters my room at night..

1266
01:37:38,466 --> 01:37:43,066
..and the next day hes introduced to me as Dr. Khan.

1267
01:37:44,224 --> 01:37:46,824
A woman ask for blood from the doctor.

1268
01:37:47,024 --> 01:37:48,324
She fights with the doctor.

1269
01:37:48,832 --> 01:37:52,332
The next day the same woman
comes to me as a nurse!

1270
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:54,832
If these are not ruses to make me go mad..

1271
01:37:57,134 --> 01:37:58,334
Shes the woman!

1272
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:01,848
My Lord! Shes the one!

1273
01:38:02,671 --> 01:38:04,371
Shes come as a lawyer this time!

1274
01:38:07,277 --> 01:38:10,377
My Lord, this action of Mr. Chaudhary..

1275
01:38:10,577 --> 01:38:12,477
..is the most important proof to the court.

1276
01:38:13,243 --> 01:38:15,643
He calls Mrs. Gupta, a lawyer, a nurse.

1277
01:38:16,305 --> 01:38:19,205
He might call me the priest of some temple.

1278
01:38:19,405 --> 01:38:21,905
He may even call you a film star
Dilip Kumar or Dharmendra.

1279
01:38:24,084 --> 01:38:25,384
Order. Order. Order.

1280
01:38:27,618 --> 01:38:28,618
This man!

1281
01:38:28,766 --> 01:38:31,666
Now youll say that hes the same lunatic that..

1282
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,120
..was later on presented as a doctor?

1283
01:38:33,212 --> 01:38:34,412
Yes, yes. Hes the one!

1284
01:38:36,373 --> 01:38:37,573
Order. Order. Order.

1285
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,660
My Lord, its all a sham!

1286
01:38:41,168 --> 01:38:43,768
Baba Khan has orchestrated it all.

1287
01:38:43,962 --> 01:38:46,662
I wanted to end his illegal empire.

1288
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:51,771
I beat up Thakur because he was an
accomplice of Baba Khan.

1289
01:38:52,073 --> 01:38:55,473
It was Thakur that was responsible
for the failure of our operation.

1290
01:38:55,746 --> 01:38:58,146
He was later killed by Baba Khans
men in the hospital.

1291
01:38:58,525 --> 01:39:00,225
So that I'd be blamed for that too.

1292
01:39:02,652 --> 01:39:04,052
Not only this, my Lord..

1293
01:39:05,061 --> 01:39:09,261
Baba Khan and Shetty are responsible
for the death of my elder son as well.

1294
01:39:11,355 --> 01:39:14,855
I didnt wish to disclose this to the court in..

1295
01:39:15,275 --> 01:39:17,075
..the presence of my family.

1296
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,400
No, mother!

1297
01:39:24,275 --> 01:39:27,775
If the court thinks I am lying and decides to..

1298
01:39:28,248 --> 01:39:30,548
..become a part of Baba Khans plot, then..

1299
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,920
My Lord! Why is my husband subjected
to this extent of torture?

1300
01:39:38,518 --> 01:39:40,918
What did he not do for the sake of his duty?

1301
01:39:41,533 --> 01:39:44,133
He endangered his own life on several occasions.

1302
01:39:45,129 --> 01:39:46,929
Today in this crowded courtroom, in this manner..

1303
01:39:50,141 --> 01:39:51,041
No!

1304
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:58,608
My Lord. I am now going to present a very crucial witness.

1305
01:39:59,011 --> 01:40:02,011
He got delayed due to an important meeting.

1306
01:40:03,035 --> 01:40:06,135
Hes the commissioner Mr. Desai.

1307
01:40:18,877 --> 01:40:21,077
When did you have a doubt that the Mr. Chaudhary..

1308
01:40:21,388 --> 01:40:22,688
..is mentally not stable?

1309
01:40:23,201 --> 01:40:26,701
I found his behaviour strange
on many earlier occasions.

1310
01:40:27,282 --> 01:40:28,282
I simply ignored.

1311
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:32,730
Like, one week after
his elder son's death..

1312
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:35,971
..he wanted to take me
to the premiere of some film.

1313
01:40:37,584 --> 01:40:38,884
I thought maybe..

1314
01:40:39,711 --> 01:40:41,911
..he wished to go there so that
he can forget that event.

1315
01:40:41,945 --> 01:40:43,145
This man is lying.

1316
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:45,567
He's framing my Dad!

1317
01:40:45,941 --> 01:40:49,041
This.. Desai is a part and parcel of Baba Khan!

1318
01:40:49,378 --> 01:40:51,078
Don't believe him!

1319
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,970
Look. You please abide
by the courts decorum.

1320
01:40:54,072 --> 01:40:56,772
You please speak when
youre called int he witness box.

1321
01:40:59,449 --> 01:41:01,849
Yes, Mr. Desai. Please speak up.
 Yes.

1322
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:06,230
One day he spoke to my daughter
about his carreer.

1323
01:41:06,574 --> 01:41:09,074
The number of times he was
transferred from city to city.

1324
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:12,783
Mr. Desai. possibly, your daughter
was quite close to him..

1325
01:41:13,346 --> 01:41:15,046
..that she took extra interest
in his conversation?

1326
01:41:15,989 --> 01:41:18,989
My Lord, my daughter is just two years old.

1327
01:41:19,544 --> 01:41:21,744
Then I began to keep an eye on him.

1328
01:41:22,033 --> 01:41:23,833
I even got my officers informed.
 You scoundrel!

1329
01:41:25,019 --> 01:41:27,719
You're my dad's enemy, you dog!
You too are a part of this plot!

1330
01:41:41,011 --> 01:41:41,911
Order

1331
01:41:50,403 --> 01:41:52,803
Vishal! What nuisance is this!

1332
01:41:54,251 --> 01:41:55,651
Vishal, youre int he court!

1333
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:57,402
Order. Order. Order.

1334
01:42:05,734 --> 01:42:06,434
Vishal!

1335
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:09,049
Vishal!

1336
01:42:18,366 --> 01:42:19,966
Leave him, Vishal! Leave him!

1337
01:42:29,369 --> 01:42:30,069
Mother!

1338
01:42:36,468 --> 01:42:41,568
On the basis of the witnesses proofs
and medical reports it has been proved..

1339
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:45,380
..that Mr. Chaudhary is mentally unstable.

1340
01:42:45,871 --> 01:42:50,271
Therefore a qualified doctor should treat him..

1341
01:42:50,295 --> 01:42:52,095
..at govt. expense.

1342
01:43:51,306 --> 01:43:52,106
Mr. Chaudhary.

1343
01:43:53,565 --> 01:43:55,565
Babu, open the door.

1344
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,280
Your son is absolutely fine.

1345
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:27,480
Everybody says hell be soon set free.

1346
01:44:30,911 --> 01:44:32,311
You felt so proud, right?

1347
01:44:33,302 --> 01:44:36,502
On your honesty and truth.

1348
01:44:38,796 --> 01:44:40,896
You've performed your duty so well

1349
01:44:43,519 --> 01:44:46,919
You collected so many medals and awards.

1350
01:44:48,857 --> 01:44:50,957
You kept bringing your bravery awards..

1351
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:54,386
..and Ill kept decorating the house.

1352
01:44:55,536 --> 01:45:01,636
The house where I feel so lonely today!

1353
01:45:06,123 --> 01:45:10,323
Your duty snatched away everything from me.

1354
01:45:12,346 --> 01:45:16,746
Am I feeling happy to see you in this condition?

1355
01:45:18,499 --> 01:45:21,299
Revathy, Vishal shouldnt have
done that int he court.

1356
01:45:22,868 --> 01:45:25,968
You dont think Vishal rightfully got angry?

1357
01:45:26,745 --> 01:45:29,245
You were insulted in full view of the court.

1358
01:45:30,055 --> 01:45:32,455
How could your son, who's grown up now..

1359
01:45:32,912 --> 01:45:34,912
..bear all this silently?

1360
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:39,541
Had he even killed Desai I'd have considered..

1361
01:45:39,816 --> 01:45:41,716
...him to have done the right thing!
 Revathy!

1362
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:44,240
How many more tests do I have to give?

1363
01:45:45,106 --> 01:45:48,706
How many more sufferings have
I to go through for being your wife?

1364
01:45:50,653 --> 01:45:54,153
The law that you swore
to all your life has..

1365
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:59,620
..struck havoc on my life today.

1366
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:04,029
You've been thrown into this darkness..

1367
01:46:04,341 --> 01:46:06,841
.. as a handicapped man...

1368
01:46:07,684 --> 01:46:09,484
..and my son..

1369
01:46:09,552 --> 01:46:12,252
My son..My son..

1370
01:46:13,228 --> 01:46:14,028
No!

1371
01:46:37,604 --> 01:46:39,904
You rogue! You hit police personnel?

1372
01:47:55,845 --> 01:47:56,645
What man!

1373
01:48:02,369 --> 01:48:06,469
What do you think? Only you know rowdyism?

1374
01:48:16,283 --> 01:48:16,983
You swine!

1375
01:48:18,295 --> 01:48:21,595
Youve not encountered someone like me!

1376
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:36,190
You rogue! Its a beginning.

1377
01:48:37,046 --> 01:48:39,846
Until I freeze your warm blood,..

1378
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:43,590
.. the court won't give a date!

1379
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:16,800
Mrs. Chaudhary!

1380
01:49:16,887 --> 01:49:21,787
Desai, don't think that I've come
to you with some request.

1381
01:49:22,064 --> 01:49:23,864
I've come to warn you!

1382
01:49:27,249 --> 01:49:29,449
Your time to get destroyed has arrived.

1383
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:33,323
If Vishal is my son..

1384
01:49:34,512 --> 01:49:36,312
..If hes my son..

1385
01:49:37,464 --> 01:49:42,164
..then no iron bars can keep him imprisoned.

1386
01:49:43,075 --> 01:49:48,275
The decision of sinners like you will happen
the moment hes out.

1387
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:49,381
Mrs. Chaudhary, you..

1388
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,500
You've drowned my life in tears.

1389
01:49:53,465 --> 01:49:56,965
If you can stop this hurricane
coming towards you.

1390
01:49:57,634 --> 01:49:59,134
Yes, Desai. Yes.

1391
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:02,159
I, the wife of Ramakant Chaudhary..

1392
01:50:02,723 --> 01:50:04,323
..and Vishals mother..

1393
01:50:05,438 --> 01:50:07,538
..declare the war today.

1394
01:55:34,589 --> 01:55:35,889
Special information.

1395
01:55:37,605 --> 01:55:44,205
Vishal Chowder, that got arrested on assaulting
the police commissioner..

1396
01:55:44,405 --> 01:55:47,205
..has escaped from the prison.

1397
01:55:48,774 --> 01:55:52,074
While the police were trying to nab him..

1398
01:55:52,242 --> 01:55:57,042
..Mr. Ramakant Chaudhary escaped
from Thanes Mental Asylum.

1399
01:55:58,789 --> 01:56:01,389
Mr. Ramakant Chaudhary was on a senior..

1400
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:03,271
..designation in the police force.

1401
01:56:03,682 --> 01:56:08,082
Recently, he was declared
unfit and removed from service.

1402
01:56:08,695 --> 01:56:13,095
He was kept at Thanes Mental Asylum
for treatment.

1403
01:56:13,689 --> 01:56:16,989
If anybody gets any information regarding..

1404
01:56:17,123 --> 01:56:19,223
.. Vishal Chaudhary or Ramakant Chaudhary..

1405
01:56:19,443 --> 01:56:22,643
..then they can get in touch with the local police station.

1406
01:56:23,145 --> 01:56:24,445
The announcement is over.

1407
01:56:31,789 --> 01:56:32,689
O God!

1408
01:56:45,901 --> 01:56:46,801
Take this.
 No!

1409
01:56:47,384 --> 01:56:48,484
Hold it and speak.

1410
01:56:49,722 --> 01:56:50,822
You cant kill me!

1411
01:56:51,491 --> 01:56:53,691
I can do anything.
 No!

1412
01:56:54,242 --> 01:56:57,042
A lunatic can do anything.
 No!

1413
01:56:58,723 --> 01:57:01,023
A lunatic can even commit a murder.
 No!

1414
01:57:01,063 --> 01:57:03,863
You want blood for your son, right?
 I dont!

1415
01:57:03,882 --> 01:57:06,682
You want blood for your son, right?
- No!

1416
01:57:06,764 --> 01:57:09,064
Will you go to the court as a lawyer?
 No!

1417
01:57:10,131 --> 01:57:11,031
Speak up!

1418
01:57:12,454 --> 01:57:13,354
Please forgive me!

1419
01:57:13,363 --> 01:57:15,963
You know who killed Thakur!

1420
01:57:16,657 --> 01:57:17,657
Spare me!

1421
01:57:18,384 --> 01:57:21,284
Disclose his name to me.
 Leave me!

1422
01:57:21,324 --> 01:57:24,224
Who killed Thakur!
 I..I am saying.

1423
01:57:24,335 --> 01:57:26,735
If Chaudhary can reach to lawyer Gupte..

1424
01:57:27,504 --> 01:57:29,204
..then hell look for Dr. Vivek too.

1425
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:32,930
Chaudhary shouldnt get any proof.

1426
01:57:34,482 --> 01:57:35,582
Kill the doctor!

1427
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,720
Vishal!

1428
01:59:18,761 --> 01:59:19,461
Dad.

1429
01:59:26,324 --> 01:59:28,024
Vishal! My son!

1430
01:59:47,715 --> 01:59:49,215
Sir, I deserved punishment.

1431
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:53,228
You saved me and my family.

1432
01:59:54,981 --> 01:59:58,281
Ill tell everything int he court.
Ill tell the truth.

1433
01:59:58,933 --> 02:00:01,833
Ill let it know how they made me kill Thakur.

1434
02:00:05,221 --> 02:00:06,821
Maybe, itd be my repentance.

1435
02:00:09,636 --> 02:00:11,736
Mr. Chaudhary, this place is
not safe for both of you.

1436
02:00:15,329 --> 02:00:17,629
Ive witnessed so much in life!

1437
02:00:18,738 --> 02:00:20,438
I saw the pyre of Vikas.

1438
02:00:21,356 --> 02:00:24,156
I happened to see your mothers tearful eyes.

1439
02:00:25,084 --> 02:00:27,184
Ive seen you..

1440
02:00:28,406 --> 02:00:32,906
..and even myself as a criminal.

1441
02:00:35,452 --> 02:00:37,652
I don't know what else I'll have to see.

1442
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:40,770
Dad.

1443
02:00:45,713 --> 02:00:48,213
Time has trampled my arrogance in such a way.

1444
02:00:51,515 --> 02:00:53,715
I had only interest since childhood:

1445
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:55,522
To run.

1446
02:00:56,832 --> 02:01:00,432
I don't know from where I'd get the strengh
to run in every competition.

1447
02:01:02,427 --> 02:01:04,727
Nobody could overtake me from any side.

1448
02:01:06,449 --> 02:01:09,049
I didnt allow anyone to pass from my left.

1449
02:01:10,962 --> 02:01:13,262
Where did I wish to reach running?

1450
02:01:14,929 --> 02:01:17,129
Which line mark did I wish to touch?

1451
02:01:19,526 --> 02:01:21,126
Ive understood it today.

1452
02:01:22,395 --> 02:01:24,395
Actually I was running all alone.

1453
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:30,059
I spent 32 years of my life
in this blind race.

1454
02:01:31,364 --> 02:01:32,464
What did I gain out of it?

1455
02:01:33,517 --> 02:01:36,117
Itd have been better
if the bullet had pierced my heart.

1456
02:01:36,483 --> 02:01:37,483
Id have died.

1457
02:01:39,185 --> 02:01:43,785
But I had to live to see this disgrace today!

1458
02:01:44,023 --> 02:01:45,523
Stop it, dad. Enough.

1459
02:01:46,679 --> 02:01:48,379
It wasnt you that got embarrassed.

1460
02:01:48,664 --> 02:01:51,264
Humanity and truth have been disgraced.

1461
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:56,422
Its not you, the victim, but the honesty
has been pushed into the darkness of disgrace.

1462
02:01:58,386 --> 02:02:00,386
Nobody can fiddle with your kind of recognition.

1463
02:02:01,837 --> 02:02:06,337
The people of the world shall always recall you as an example.

1464
02:02:07,936 --> 02:02:11,036
Yes dad. They shall always remember your name.

1465
02:02:12,046 --> 02:02:13,246
They shall always remember.

1466
02:02:18,792 --> 02:02:20,492
I dont want any excuse.

1467
02:02:21,010 --> 02:02:23,510
Kill them if you cant catch them alive.

1468
02:02:24,299 --> 02:02:26,499
I give you 24 hours.

1469
02:02:29,845 --> 02:02:31,345
What bad news have you brought now?

1470
02:02:31,609 --> 02:02:34,209
Sir, we have arrested Mr. Chaudhary.

1471
02:02:38,653 --> 02:02:40,153
Yes.
- Inspector Vijay, sir.

1472
02:02:40,694 --> 02:02:42,194
You mustve got the news.

1473
02:02:42,583 --> 02:02:45,083
Mr. Chaudhary has created a scene in the lock up.

1474
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:46,580
You please come over, sir.

1475
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:02,200
Sir, I am very glad today.

1476
02:03:02,338 --> 02:03:04,838
My transfer to Junagadh
has finally got permanently stalled.

1477
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:06,670
Sir, we both are to be promoted.

1478
02:03:09,594 --> 02:03:10,594
Yes, inspector Sharma.

1479
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:13,200
Sir, we have taken away the revolver from him.
 Good.

1480
02:03:16,926 --> 02:03:20,226
It appears that you didnt like
the environment of the mental asylum.

1481
02:03:21,172 --> 02:03:26,572
You forgot that I've cut all yours
links with the outside world.

1482
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:37,540
Whats happening?

1483
02:03:40,022 --> 02:03:41,222
Why did you lock the door?

1484
02:03:53,787 --> 02:03:57,087
They won't obey you anymore
Desai.

1485
02:03:58,505 --> 02:04:02,405
Because your dirty nature
has been exposed to them

1486
02:04:29,521 --> 02:04:32,421
You!
 Yes, its me.

1487
02:04:33,302 --> 02:04:37,302
After being slapped by truth just once,
everything seems blurred to you!

1488
02:04:39,537 --> 02:04:40,537
Did you recognize him?

1489
02:04:44,454 --> 02:04:48,954
Hes one of those sinners that
proved my father a criminal.

1490
02:05:13,393 --> 02:05:15,693
Hello. Khadapasi police station.

1491
02:05:16,242 --> 02:05:17,842
What! Mr. Desai?

1492
02:05:18,215 --> 02:05:20,015
Actually hes busy. Hes eating.

1493
02:05:20,531 --> 02:05:22,631
Yes. You call later?

1494
02:05:23,205 --> 02:05:25,505
Actually its like taking a chance.

1495
02:05:25,752 --> 02:05:27,052
Yes. Thank you.

1496
02:05:36,223 --> 02:05:38,723
Desai, now see my court!

1497
02:05:39,636 --> 02:05:42,336
Everything right from witness,
arguments to proofs..

1498
02:05:43,157 --> 02:05:44,557
..they are going to be presented right here today.

1499
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:47,960
If you love your life..

1500
02:05:49,607 --> 02:05:51,707
..then youll kill him.

1501
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:10,121
No! Mr. Desai, please dont kill me! No!

1502
02:06:10,259 --> 02:06:11,859
Mr. Desai, I did so much for you!

1503
02:06:12,052 --> 02:06:14,052
No, Mr. Desai! No!
 Shoot!

1504
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:26,600
Mr. Desai, sign these papers.
 Whats there in it?

1505
02:06:26,676 --> 02:06:29,976
Its an order to raid Khans
and Shettys locations.

1506
02:06:30,113 --> 02:06:31,313
I wont sign these papers.

1507
02:06:31,618 --> 02:06:33,318
Desai, youll sign for sure.

1508
02:06:34,014 --> 02:06:34,814
Look!

1509
02:06:37,185 --> 02:06:38,585
..this photopgraph and casette.

1510
02:06:39,762 --> 02:06:44,162
This photo will get published
within an hour if you dont sign.

1511
02:06:44,698 --> 02:06:49,298
The headline shall be, Commissioner Desai
shoots constable Gupta.

1512
02:06:49,651 --> 02:06:52,551
My job! My prestige!

1513
02:06:53,143 --> 02:06:55,143
Then sign on these papers.

1514
02:07:17,142 --> 02:07:18,242
Get hold of him!

1515
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:21,890
Remove all our consignments from the
warehouses at Chembur and Virar.

1516
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:25,900
Stop...stop!

1517
02:07:30,297 --> 02:07:30,997
License.

1518
02:07:37,545 --> 02:07:38,545
Check at the rear side.

1519
02:07:40,686 --> 02:07:43,986
Let them go. Let them go. Go.

1520
02:07:45,779 --> 02:07:46,579
Bring that van.

1521
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:54,480
Dont move! Dont move! Hands down!

1522
02:07:55,557 --> 02:07:56,457
Get hold of him!

1523
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:02,618
A big stock of drug got seized.

1524
02:08:02,755 --> 02:08:03,955
The police have done a commendable job.

1525
02:08:04,142 --> 02:08:05,642
Hard to believe! Marvellous job!

1526
02:08:05,937 --> 02:08:08,437
The police can do anything
if it decides to.

1527
02:08:08,687 --> 02:08:11,087
Twenty girls freed from
the clutches of pimps.

1528
02:08:11,652 --> 02:08:15,852
Police found 20 girls in a flat
a building in Anderi

1529
02:08:16,454 --> 02:08:19,154
This flat is said to be of some
close relative of Baba Khan.

1530
02:08:19,369 --> 02:08:21,869
Such people should be hanged
irrspective of who they are.

1531
02:08:21,973 --> 02:08:24,773
The police are decisively
after Khan and Shetty.

1532
02:08:24,895 --> 02:08:27,195
I heard some girls were found
in a flat belonging to Khan.

1533
02:08:27,293 --> 02:08:29,993
They are worthless people! They should be caught that way.

1534
02:08:30,107 --> 02:08:33,907
Mr. Desai, I believe Khan and Shetty
are out of their dreams?

1535
02:08:34,966 --> 02:08:38,566
The whole city has come
to know of their evil deeds.

1536
02:08:39,832 --> 02:08:44,732
I think its high time you sign
arrest warrants.

1537
02:08:45,007 --> 02:08:48,407
No. Please dont let me do this.
They will..

1538
02:08:48,666 --> 02:08:49,666
Please sign.

1539
02:09:00,124 --> 02:09:03,324
Sir, we should have tea on this occasion of you permit.

1540
02:09:03,814 --> 02:09:05,814
Mr. Desai, please have some tea.
Please.

1541
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:16,039
What!
 Now youll say hes the one that you killed!

1542
02:09:16,458 --> 02:09:18,858
Yes! Yes, hes the one!

1543
02:09:20,953 --> 02:09:26,253
Mr. Desai, even we know to play game.

1544
02:09:26,387 --> 02:09:30,287
The claim of nabbing them in 24 hours.

1545
02:09:36,352 --> 02:09:38,652
Shetty, today youve become
of equalled status.

1546
02:09:40,906 --> 02:09:43,406
Baba Khan! Mana Shetty!

1547
02:09:47,504 --> 02:09:49,004
It looks our weights look equal.

1548
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:54,499
Even the law holders have proved
that even our prices are the same.

1549
02:09:54,753 --> 02:09:57,753
Brother Khan, its not
the time for us to fight.

1550
02:09:58,118 --> 02:09:59,618
Its to befriend.

1551
02:10:01,995 --> 02:10:06,695
Brother Khan, Chaudhary and Vishal
want to stop both of us.

1552
02:10:07,651 --> 02:10:10,751
And the entire city 
police force is with them.

1553
02:10:11,239 --> 02:10:14,139
Brother Khan, that's why this meeting
of ours was most necessary.

1554
02:10:15,636 --> 02:10:20,136
Azt sem akarom, hogy a rendõrség
 valaha is vitassa az uralmunkat. 

1555
02:10:20,307 --> 02:10:23,307
The criminal and police shall
have a face to face fight now.

1556
02:10:23,846 --> 02:10:27,246
Shetty, our first attack should be on any..

1557
02:10:28,327 --> 02:10:29,827
..weak point of theirs.

1558
02:10:30,308 --> 02:10:35,208
The weakness is Chaudharys wife
and Vishals mother.

1559
02:12:16,393 --> 02:12:18,393
Chaudhary!
 No!

1560
02:12:19,904 --> 02:12:20,604
No, Shetty.

1561
02:12:22,839 --> 02:12:27,339
Brother Khan, the blood of my brother on the road..

1562
02:12:28,267 --> 02:12:31,467
..shall be washed away only with blood!

1563
02:12:32,601 --> 02:12:37,101
Chaudharys constable is
roaming openly on the streets.

1564
02:13:16,724 --> 02:13:21,124
Inspector Sharma.
Another soldier of that lot.

1565
02:13:22,136 --> 02:13:24,936
That has proclaimed a war against us.

1566
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:27,980
The police personnel roams
around alone at this hour..

1567
02:13:28,171 --> 02:13:30,871
..it implies that the reputation of crime world is in danger.

1568
02:14:09,497 --> 02:14:11,597
Id told you earlier that these people
can do anything.

1569
02:14:13,059 --> 02:14:15,659
Mr. Chaudhary, youre responsible
for inspector Sharmas death.

1570
02:14:16,204 --> 02:14:16,904
Its you!

1571
02:14:18,423 --> 02:14:20,823
People like you have empowered the people..

1572
02:14:21,449 --> 02:14:24,449
..that have murdered Sharma.

1573
02:14:25,647 --> 02:14:29,447
Mr. Desai, when a brave police personnel dies it
brings a sea change.

1574
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:34,470
The punishment to Shetty
and Khan is not imprisonment..

1575
02:14:34,915 --> 02:14:36,215
..but death.

1576
02:14:42,549 --> 02:14:43,949
Hello.
- Mr. Chaudhary.

1577
02:14:44,304 --> 02:14:47,904
Its for the first time that a police personnel
has tried to uproot our reign.

1578
02:14:48,867 --> 02:14:50,967
Youll have to bear its consequence.

1579
02:14:51,256 --> 02:14:54,956
Khan!
 You didnt give me any chance to save my brother.

1580
02:14:55,435 --> 02:14:58,935
Well surely give you a chance
to save your wife.

1581
02:14:59,819 --> 02:15:00,619
What! Revathy..

1582
02:15:01,107 --> 02:15:04,807
We'll leave your wife at the Fountain
 crossroad at one o'clock.

1583
02:15:05,027 --> 02:15:09,027
You both can witness our unabashed
display of rowdysm over there.

1584
02:15:12,341 --> 02:15:13,241
Dad, what happened?

1585
02:15:14,424 --> 02:15:15,824
Is mother ok? Dad!

1586
02:15:16,654 --> 02:15:18,154
Vishal, your mother is not well.

1587
02:15:20,024 --> 02:15:22,024
Weve got only an hour. Lets go!

1588
02:15:32,646 --> 02:15:33,446
Dad! Mother!

1589
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:36,790
Revathy!

1590
02:15:39,261 --> 02:15:41,061
Wheres she gone? Shes not to be seen.

1591
02:15:47,069 --> 02:15:48,069
Revathy!

1592
02:15:49,328 --> 02:15:51,028
Mother!
 Dont come close to me!

1593
02:15:51,058 --> 02:15:52,358
Dont come near me!
- Mother!

1594
02:15:52,468 --> 02:15:55,568
Dont get close to me! No!
Dont come close to me!

1595
02:15:55,685 --> 02:15:56,885
Mother, nothing will happen to you!
 No!

1596
02:15:56,929 --> 02:15:58,129
I promise you! I love you, mother!
 Vishal!

1597
02:15:58,318 --> 02:16:00,418
Dad, please save mother!

1598
02:16:00,576 --> 02:16:03,076
Stop them! Somebody stop them!

1599
02:16:03,346 --> 02:16:05,846
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!

1600
02:16:05,981 --> 02:16:08,281
Let me save my mother! Leave me!

1601
02:16:08,929 --> 02:16:11,329
Revathy!
 Save my mother!

1602
02:16:12,175 --> 02:16:14,275
No!
 Mother! I love you! I love you!

1603
02:16:14,596 --> 02:16:16,696
Mother, you wont get hurt! Mother!

1604
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:19,952
Mother, you wont be hurt!
Well return to our house.

1605
02:16:21,147 --> 02:16:22,747
No!
 Revathy!

1606
02:16:23,733 --> 02:16:27,033
Leave me! Leave me!
My mother will die!

1607
02:16:27,338 --> 02:16:28,738
My mother will die!

1608
02:16:29,871 --> 02:16:30,971
Free me!

1609
02:16:31,410 --> 02:16:33,410
Mother, you dont worry!
Well return to our house.

1610
02:16:33,843 --> 02:16:34,443
Mother!

1611
02:16:36,927 --> 02:16:38,027
Mother!

1612
02:16:39,066 --> 02:16:40,466
Revathy!

1613
02:16:44,764 --> 02:16:45,864
Mother!

1614
02:16:50,655 --> 02:16:53,255
Mother!
- Revathy!

1615
02:16:55,002 --> 02:16:56,102
Mother!
- Revathy!

1616
02:16:56,711 --> 02:16:58,211
Mother! Mother!

1617
02:17:00,384 --> 02:17:01,384
Mother!

1618
02:17:03,078 --> 02:17:05,578
Mother! Mother!

1619
02:17:06,401 --> 02:17:08,001
Mother!

1620
02:18:54,321 --> 02:18:56,121
You got my son killed, right?

1621
02:18:57,498 --> 02:18:59,498
You killed my wife!

1622
02:19:01,104 --> 02:19:03,004
My wifes killer!

1623
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:54,620
Hes Mana Shetty!

1624
02:19:54,738 --> 02:19:56,538
This devil has killed many helpless people!

1625
02:19:56,727 --> 02:19:58,327
Hit him!
 Kill him!

1626
02:19:58,528 --> 02:20:00,028
Catch him!
 Kill him!

1627
02:20:52,869 --> 02:20:53,669
No!

1628
02:20:55,947 --> 02:20:57,947
No, Chaudhary! Forgive me!

1629
02:20:58,443 --> 02:20:59,243
No!

1630
02:21:01,551 --> 02:21:03,651
No! No!..No!

1631
02:21:06,577 --> 02:21:07,777
No! No!

1632
02:21:13,226 --> 02:21:13,926
No!

1633
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:15,910
No!

1634
02:21:32,538 --> 02:21:34,938
Kill him! Kill him!

1635
02:21:46,185 --> 02:21:47,185
No!

1636
02:21:47,854 --> 02:21:48,554
No!

1637
02:21:50,691 --> 02:21:53,291
No, Chaudhary! Forgive me! No!

1638
02:21:57,252 --> 02:21:58,152
No! No!

1639
02:22:00,957 --> 02:22:02,457
No! No!

1640
02:22:08,956 --> 02:22:10,456
Kill him! Kill him!
 No!

1641
02:22:11,503 --> 02:22:13,103
Hit him! Kill him!
 No!

1642
02:24:20,221 --> 02:24:21,021
Brother Khan!

1643
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:25,140
Brother Khan!

1644
02:24:27,255 --> 02:24:30,055
Brother Khan, please save me!
 What?

1645
02:24:31,179 --> 02:24:34,079
The movement of my life can stop any moment.
 What!

1646
02:24:34,496 --> 02:24:36,396
Chaudhary has tied a bomb to me.

1647
02:24:38,305 --> 02:24:39,805
Brother Khan, please remove it.

1648
02:24:40,921 --> 02:24:42,521
Brother Khan, please remove it.

1649
02:24:43,279 --> 02:24:45,579
Or else Ill die.
 Then die! Youd kill me?

1650
02:24:45,753 --> 02:24:47,953
Brother Khan, please remove it. Brother Khan!
 Move away!

1651
02:24:48,489 --> 02:24:50,489
Brother Khan, save..
 Dont come close!

1652
02:24:50,683 --> 02:24:52,283
Brother Khan, please save me. Brother Khan!

1653
02:24:55,552 --> 02:24:57,052
Leave!
- Brother Khan, please save me.

1654
02:24:57,278 --> 02:24:58,678
Brother Khan, remove it.
 Leave me!

1655
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:01,460
Leave!
- Brother Khan, remove it. Or else we both shall lose our movement.

1656
02:25:01,734 --> 02:25:03,434
Brother Khan!
 Leave me!

1657
02:25:03,453 --> 02:25:05,653
Remove it soon!
 Leave me! I dont wish to die!

1658
02:25:05,735 --> 02:25:07,935
Brother Khan!
- Leave me! Shetty, leave me!

1659
02:25:08,205 --> 02:25:09,105
Brother Khan!
- Shetty, leave me!

1660
02:25:33,278 --> 02:25:35,578
Sir, they got Thakur killed through me.

1661
02:25:36,063 --> 02:25:37,363
Mr. Chaudhary is not guilty.

1662
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:01,900
Congrats!

1663
02:26:16,316 --> 02:26:18,216
Youre suspended, Mr. Desai.
