171
00:22:35,157 --> 00:22:36,852
. . heaven or hell.

172
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:40,017
Don't use your tongue
in any way you want.

173
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:42,722
lt might even kill you.

174
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,206
Long live. . -. . the leader of
granite lands' representative.

175
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:53,677
l am proud of you. .

177
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,339
Long live. . - Lokanatham!

178
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,885
''Sir, you think the granite
site's problem will be solved. . ''

179
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,988
. . after the stay order?
- Ask that question. .

180
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,716
. . to contractor Basi Reddy
and the state government.

181
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:05,086
What gave you
confidence to challenge. .

182
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:06,250
. . government's decision?

183
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,698
Just a few days ago you
bro-in-law bought half acre land.

184
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:13,924
How much did he buy it for?

185
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:16,168
You can say it.
Everyone knows about it.

186
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,498
6 million rupees. - You know
how much they got for that. .

187
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,763
''. . as per the GO?
- 90,000 rupees. ''

188
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:24,310
''Brother, even injustice has a limit. ''

189
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:27,005
When you cross that limit
it gets tough for everyone.

190
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:29,781
You are finding government's fault?

191
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:33,209
There is no government in
our country to find faults.

192
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:35,718
There's only hooliganism.

193
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:39,184
Move aside. Move aside.

194
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,091
''Greetings, sir. Mr. Basi
Reddy invited you for breakfast. ''

195
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,763
There's nice breakfast at
my home too this morning.

196
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:48,096
''Ask your Mr. Reddy to come.
- Ok, sir. - Greetings!''

197
00:23:48,935 --> 00:23:51,529
For breakfast? Where?

198
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:55,139
Thrash him. Thrash him.

199
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,411
''Hey, is there only one
solution for every problem?''

200
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:02,948
Hold your hands back
and learn to speak.

201
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:10,814
''Hey, even if your boss
comes to MLA's home. . ''

202
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:13,916
. . he will be
thrashed black and blue.

203
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:16,222
Ask him to pay the
right amount for our land.

204
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:19,830
Or else ask your boss
to go to hell. Get lost.

205
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:27,406
Stop smoking in front of me at
least for my reputation's sake.

206
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,472
They say there's no
scientific link between. .

207
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:30,941
''. . cigarette and reputation, father. ''

208
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:33,773
''And also, the reason
l picked this habit. . ''

209
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,111
. . as you smoked in front of me
since childhood. For heroism.

210
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,985
''Rubbish! And also, l
heard that you fought. . ''

211
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,521
. . with someone early in the
morning. What's the matter?

212
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,223
l thrashed him just now.
lt already reached you?

213
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,289
lf MLA's son thrashes people
it will first become SMS news. .

214
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:51,091
. . before it appears in newspapers.

215
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:55,526
Don't get involved
in such silly fights.

216
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:57,603
We have got men to do that.

217
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,932
l told you so many times to
give up those local cigars.

218
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,568
Both are as harmful.

219
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:19,447
''Greetings, MLA! l feels
like l am looking at sun. ''

220
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:22,153
''Father, he is Mr. Basi Reddy,
the contractor. ''

221
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:24,423
He wanted to meet you.
- No need for introductions.

222
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:28,559
l know your father from the
time he started out in politics.

223
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:31,466
l don't forget people if
you are not in ruling party. .

224
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,937
. . for two terms.

225
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:38,271
ln college your son and
my son are great friends.

226
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:42,006
''Kids, go outside and play caroms. ''

227
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:47,175
''What's the matter, Lokam?''

228
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:50,283
You are looking at
me as if l am a snake.

229
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:57,222
Congrats for getting temporary
stay order on granite sites.

230
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,197
l am left with no other option.

231
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,096
l came here for a compromise.

232
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:08,606
What's the matter? He
doesn't play caroms.

233
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,036
''He plays different games, Reddy. ''

234
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:16,042
lf you come straight to the
point time will move forward.

235
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,547
He says there's no scientific link. .

236
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:25,216
. . between cigarette and reputation.

237
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:30,653
You brought your son
will great love and care.

238
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:35,159
You are troubling people like me. .

239
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:41,434
lf you don't keep a watchful
eye forever it will be difficult.

240
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:43,436
You are destroying
huts and building homes.

241
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,945
lf we don't fast for a while
the system won't be balanced.

242
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:52,952
''You were born in the
computer age, but you talk. . ''

243
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:55,021
. . like a naxalite .

244
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,681
Wherever you go there is
only one rule you follow.

245
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,356
Snatch whatever you can
whenever you get a chance.

246
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,222
Then go and keep doing that.
What are you doing here?

247
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:11,570
From panchayat board's PA
to prime minister's PA. .

248
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:16,734
. . l greased every
idiot's palm to clear this GO.

249
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:21,613
And now your father passed
a stay order against it.

250
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:25,208
Even if he tries to be
Gandhi he won't get a vote. .

251
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:26,979
. . till he shows notes.

252
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:30,579
First remove your leg from my
booty and settle that matter.

253
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,250
l will provide as much
funding as required.

254
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,555
Senior politician
and kid politician. .

255
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:39,530
. . both of you think about it
well and take a good decision.

256
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,432
''Goodbye. - Reddy, direct that
funding towards this settlement. ''

257
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:46,366
We will take care of the votes.

258
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,000
Your son looks very sharp.

259
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:54,075
This is the age
where you lack maturity.

260
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,205
Keep it with yourself.

261
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,417
l am from Mangampeta.

262
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:05,749
lf we don't get leave we
branches and we don't get. .

263
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,654
. . braches we cut the roots.

264
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,395
How many more millions
do you want to earn?

265
00:28:17,504 --> 00:28:20,200
Will you take it with
you after your death?

266
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,502
No one who gets thrashed
by the labor prospers.

267
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,577
You will die with cancer.
Die with cancer.

268
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:25,736
Die with cancer. Die with cancer.

269
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:27,107
Durga.

270
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,145
lf you want to hit people like
him with sandals there are. .

271
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,314
. . thousands of crooks out there.
Will you thrash everyone?

272
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,618
We will at least
thrash the one we get.

273
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:50,830
You already started eating?

274
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,102
l asked you to wait till l
bring the holy offering.

275
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,804
''How does it matter when we
eat the holy offering, auntie!''

276
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,600
''l will be two rows
behind you in heaven, right?''

277
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,178
''Eat slowly, without gulping it once. ''

278
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:04,477
''He was born to gulp.
Rules won't work out, mother. ''

279
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:09,348
l studied hard. l am
not a dropout like you.

280
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,656
''Hey, l heard you are still
hanging out with college students. . ''

281
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:17,730
. . and overseeing elections.

282
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,193
''l am campaigning for him, daddy. ''

283
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,360
''He is Basi Reddy's son, right?
- Yes, sir. ''

284
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,195
Great. Fathers are at
each others' throat. .

285
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,672
. . and sons are best of friends.

286
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,776
Befriend some
low-class friends as well.

287
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:33,709
lt's good for you.

288
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:36,739
One wayward guy is
enough for this family.

289
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,216
Stop this roaming and
think of what to do next.

290
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,377
He's talking about you.
He called you wayward.

291
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,455
''You heard it?
- Greetings, uncle. ''

292
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:45,849
Suddenly your father
asked for a job for you. .

293
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,721
. . and l wondered
when you joined college.

294
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,697
Dharma. - Sir. - Appoint this
girl as the manager of our hotel.

295
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,394
''And the present manager, sir?
- Fire him and make him. . ''

296
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,471
''. . clean utensils at
your home, you drunkard. ''

297
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:02,598
''Thank you, uncle.
- Ok, dear. Savitri, send my dress. ''

298
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,744
''O really! Let's go now.
- Hey, learn to respect your guests. ''

299
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,406
''l can't tolerate it.
- O really! Hey, Chinna!''

300
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:12,312
My Sumo is yours from today.

301
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:15,217
Why? Has it become old for you?

302
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:20,385
Just kidding. You look like
Venky in the movie 'Laxmi'.

303
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:22,158
''By the way, thanks. ''

304
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:25,760
''Hey, first of all cut off your
links with that college. - Really!''

305
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,632
lf l don't maintain at
least these few links. .

306
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:30,294
. . my family's reputation
will take a huge beating.

307
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:31,461
Take it easy.

308
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:35,897
lt's already lunch time.
Will you end breakfast now?

309
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:40,906
ls sir there at home?
- Which sir?

310
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,808
Junior sir. - Father is
senior sir. He's junior sir.

311
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:48,513
And what am l? Pumpkin?
He's there inside. Go.

312
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:57,528
''What's the matter, dear? You
are crying outside home naked?''

313
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,391
Oh no!

314
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,462
Who did it? Your sister?
- Yes.

315
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:08,639
l guessed it right then.
ls she a woman or Mayawati?

316
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:10,773
''And what you did, dear?''

317
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,707
l just threw her
scooter's keys in the water tank.

318
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:18,714
''You did such a
nice thing? Why, dear?''

319
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,979
''l don't want to go to
the school today, uncle. ''

320
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:22,546
For cricket?

321
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:26,421
''Hey, idiot, l will beat you up.
Come and wear your pant. ''

322
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:29,660
You should be declaring
such matters in public.

323
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,560
You should quietly go to school.

324
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,662
You should come back as
soon as the school is over.

325
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:37,598
''Go and wear the pant, dear. Go. ''

326
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:42,967
''Hey, Surpanakha! Come downstairs. ''

327
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,834
Stripping a kid is not machismo. .

328
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,912
lf you have guts dare to strip me.

329
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:51,249
''Sorry, brother-in-law. ''

330
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:55,317
l couldn't reach the keys. That
is why l am emptying the tank.

331
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:56,683
You are dead meat.

332
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,848
You. .

333
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,555
You don't need to
waste so much water. .

334
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:04,630
. . to get the keys in the tank.
Out there people are. .

335
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:06,392
. . committing murders
for a pot of water.

336
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,758
Now see this. The water
is the tank is saved. .

337
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:09,994

You ruined my college dress.

340
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,304
Stop.

341
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:23,438
Why are you staring
at me in that way?

342
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,676
You have got such a firm figure.

343
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,483
''Sorry, girl. l got
a bit carried away. ''

344
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:35,857
''O God! Oh no! Who will

345
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,522
l am gong to throw you from here.

346
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,058
''Ok, l will marry you then.
- That's what l fear. ''

347
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:44,928
Leave me. - You are a
college dropout. You're a rogue.

348
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:46,403
Come to your sister. l
will show you what l can do.

349
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,474
lf you tell them about the
kiss they will definitely. .

. . get you married to me.
Go and take a bath. Go.

351
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:55,711
O God! He leaked the tyre.
- Great. - l'm getting late now.

352
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:57,476
Why are you after her
as soon as you came?

353
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:59,842
Alright. l am
getting late to the clinic.

354
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,011
Drop them at their school. Her too.
- What? At school?

355
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:05,022
''No, thanks. lnstead of
going with this goon. . ''

356
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:06,455
. . l will go on auto-rickshaw.

357
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,353
''l will break your teeth,
if you talk like that. ''

358
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:12,454
You're the goon in a girl's attire.
- Wow!

359
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:14,532
l said just one word
about her brother and look. .

360
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:17,626
. . how angry she got angry?
You know what he did upstairs?

361
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:22,803
Even when l see him it burns me.

362
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:24,570
Then use some nice lotion.

363
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,704
He will be your husband eventually.

364
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:30,043
You saw those brother
and sister's atrocities?

365
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:32,117
What happened?
- My condition is like that of. .

366
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:33,476
. . the crickets' on Australia Tour.

367
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,952
Leave it. l am getting
late to clinic. - l knew it.

368
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,750
And there are two little
monkeys to his company.

369
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:39,882
''What have you done?
- You know her, brother-in-law. ''

370
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:44,794
This sari shouldn't have come here.

371
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,798
Tell them not to waste
a betel leaf and nut. .

372
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,561
. . by inviting someone
who is not going to come.

373
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:49,965
Have you at least seen
what this invitation is for?

374
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:53,061
l saw it. l didn't throw
it even after l saw it.

375
00:33:53,172 --> 00:33:55,663
There's only one remaining
relation with that family.

376
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,573
Enough of dramas in
our lives till now.

377
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:00,441
At least now ask
them to stop these acts.

378
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:16,989
Let's go. - Actually in 1870
Bolsheviks revolted on Java. .

379
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,530
''Hey, your phone is with me, right?''

380
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:20,690
How are you talking on phone?

381
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,995
l see. Sorry. Sorry.
You are showing off?

382
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:31,667
Drop me as well. Wait.

383
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,840
Pawan. l have been
trying her since so long.

384
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,918
Has Sheela enquired
about me about me even once?

385
00:34:39,018 --> 00:34:40,076
She enquired about you.
- What did she say?

386
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:43,053
She asked the guy who
stands at our house everyday. .

387
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:47,923
. . and looks towards their house. .
Who is that idiot?

388
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:51,155
O Sheela! Did you tell
her l am writing lAS exams?

389
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:55,659
l told her that he asked me to
tell that he's writing lAS exams.

390
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,532
l will hit you. You don't
have any helping nature.

391
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:02,906
Hello! Stop there. l need to
pick up my friends. - Friends?

392
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:04,974
l won't see anyone
other than Sheela.

393
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:07,842
Friends? The look
like belly dancers.

394
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:11,778
''lf you don't have a fashion sense,
keep your mouth shut. ''

395
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:13,451
Bin Laden attacked
and Saddam was bombed.

396
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:15,521
He made a comment
and you thrashed me?

397
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,622
''Hey, what are you
doing in front of kids!''

398
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,927
''Hey, didn't l tell you not to
get smart in front of girls?''

399
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:33,235
Didn't l tell you not to
spit on my face while talking?

400
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,005
l am becoming a joke at every turn.

401
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,044
No one will take me seriously
till l commit a couple of rapes.

402
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:43,648
Hello! Why are you
driving like an old fox?

403
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:47,775
lncrease some speed in life.
He's driving it like a cart.

404
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:48,945
Buddy.

405
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:07,004
''Hey, when should l pick you up?''

406
00:36:07,106 --> 00:36:09,267
Goodbye to your ride and
goodbye to your speed.

407
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:12,635
''Buddy, are they going to college?
- l doubt it. ''

408
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,599
So that's the matter. Her
oxygen is in this campus.

409
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:38,864
Unless she is disgraced here
she won't come to my path.

410
00:36:39,939 --> 00:36:43,204
''Listen, go to your sister and
call her mother and trouble her. ''

411
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:47,143
l will take care of the rest.
- Mother. - Mother.

412
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,211
Mummy. Mummy.

413
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,977
Mummy. Mummy. Today we
shall go to the zoo with daddy.

414
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,576
''Hey, who's your mummy?
Who's your mummy?''

415
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:56,655
Go to your school.
What are you doing here. .

416
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,280
. . instead of going
to school? Go. Go.

00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,822
''Brother. Hey, brother. ''

''Brother. Hey, brother. ''

00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:08,822
''Brother. Hey, brother. ''

420
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,302
''Brother. Hey, brother. ''

421
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:13,930
Brother.

422
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:19,609
''During Y2K days, in
Vijayawada's summer, brother. . ''

''ln Kanuru center, in
Mannuru lanes, brother. . ''

424
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:28,615
''This beautiful
lady bowled me over. ''

425
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:32,020
''She came into my life
and became my wife. ''

426
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,720
''And ever since then she
made me mad. - Brother. ''

427
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:41,733
''During Y2K days, in
Vijayawada's summer, brother. . ''

428
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:48,265
''ln Kanuru center, in
Mannuru lanes, brother. . ''

429
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:10,687
''Brother. .
- ''''One day l was going on my bike. . ''

430
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,792
''. . l fell down from my bike. ''

431
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:19,704
''She laughed at me l was floored. ''

432
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:24,935
''She enticed me. She bedazzled me. ''

433
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:28,275
''She completely bowled me over. ''

434
00:38:28,781 --> 00:38:32,410
''She said ignore the caste,
you are mine. ''

435
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:58,673
Then what happen?
- Tragedy started.

436
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:02,373
''She made me do all
the household chores. ''

437
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:05,749
''She was busy with her make-up. ''

438
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:10,049
''She smeared my face with
grease and pushed me away. ''

439
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:13,353
''And she came to college
with scent on her dresses. ''

440
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:18,326
''She entices me. She teases me. ''

441
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:22,026
''l ask her to talk to me
and she fights with me. ''

442
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:25,762
''She threw the
nuptial thread at me. ''

443
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:30,307
But the tragedy l saw in
movies looks different.

444
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,967
The tragedies in
movies are different. .

445
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,046
''. . and the tragedies in real
life are different, buddy. ''

446
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:40,242
''During Y2K days, in
Vijayawada's summer, brother. . ''

447

''ln Kanuru center, in
Mannuru lanes, brother. . ''

448
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:50,290
Oh! l am not married.

449
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:53,726
How do l look?
- Wow!

450
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,460
You look like 'lron
Man' Vallabhai Patel.

451
00:39:55,568 --> 00:39:57,399
What? He too had a tail like this?

452
00:39:57,503 --> 00:39:58,902
Wait a minute.
l became such a big leader. .

453
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,405
. . and you think l don't
know how to drape the panchi.

454
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:03,041
Now?

455
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:05,538
''You look like a groom, father. ''

456
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,318
Do we need all this?

457
00:40:22,828 --> 00:40:23,920
l feel a bit embarrassed.

458
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:31,164
''Father, once you became a
groom for a shattered family. . ''

459
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,331
''. . in a low-key marriage.
This is all for you, father. ''

460
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,399
For your kind heart.

461
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:40,170
You must always keep your head high.

462
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,022
What? She didn't like the groom?

463
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:01,827
You should've told me that before.

464
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:08,469
She is upset as if she is
forced into the marriage.

465
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:09,899
Dharma.

466
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,235
''You may go now, priest. ''

467
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:23,882
''Good try, but it went a bit
overboard like a Tamil movie. ''

468
00:41:24,256 --> 00:41:26,417
''There are a few chords which
you should never touch, bro. ''

469
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,151
Remember it.

470
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:38,236
''Granny, you won't see my drawing?''

471
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:40,032
''Hey, enough of drawing. ''

472
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:42,107
Pack your books. You are
getting late for school.

473
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:48,307
l am getting late to the hospital.
l have to go now.

474
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:56,612
Don't come again
with tears in eyes. .

475
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,220
. . and trouble me and my kids.

476
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,454
Still l don't understand
what l have done wrong.

477
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:08,160
That's why whenever l
bring a mother's love here. .

478
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:10,235
. . l am sent back with scolding.

479
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:12,361
After six months of
your husband's death. .

480
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:14,370
. . you married another man.

481
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:17,505
l too feel ashamed
whenever l see you.

482
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:21,636
For whom did l get married?

483
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:25,311
lf it was for us you wouldn't
have given us a step brother.

484
00:43:04,156 --> 00:43:07,023
''l made a mistake by
approving this function, Savitri. ''

485
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:14,329
She says l made a
mistake by remarrying.

486
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,300
She says l became
gave her a step brother.

487
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:23,230
l had a child with you as it
wouldn't have been right. .

488
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:27,608
. . on my part to just use you
as a provider for this family.

489
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:32,380
l can't even tell her this.

490
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,650
Had l known that my
last child would give us. .

491
00:43:34,753 --> 00:43:35,981
. . so much heartburn l
wouldn't have given birth to him.

492
00:44:49,683 --> 00:44:52,083
They brought all the chicks
from town and kissing them.

493
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:54,153
Whose batch is that?
- Very influential batch.

494
00:44:54,254 --> 00:44:57,246
One guy is SP's son. One
guy is Basi Reddy's son.

495
00:44:57,357 --> 00:44:59,325
Another one is MLA's son.
They are changing. .

496
00:44:59,426 --> 00:45:01,394
. . Vijayawada's culture
with their dance and drugs.

497
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:07,165
''And that guy, is he
suffering from asthma?''

498
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:11,101
''lt looks like that, but
there are drugs inside it. ''

499
00:45:12,706 --> 00:45:15,038
''You are throwing the party,
but you are sitting here alone?''

500
00:45:15,142 --> 00:45:17,303
The floor is on swing. Come on.

501
00:45:18,912 --> 00:45:21,244
Who is he?
- Third year student.

502
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:23,305
He wants to join our gang.
- Really?

503
00:45:24,017 --> 00:45:27,646
ls our gang that famous?
- His father is Rajya Sabha member.

504
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:34,255
l don't want to know his
father's qualification.

505
00:45:34,928 --> 00:45:37,362
But my flow test's stamina.
You know the syllabus?

506
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:40,925
To get thrashed for 30
seconds with screaming.

507
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:52,874
''Buddy. .
- Hey, this is a public place. . ''

508
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:56,107
''Let's not get into all
this here. Hey, listen to me. ''

509
00:45:57,384 --> 00:45:59,079
We got a scapegoat
after a long time.

510
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:01,154
No. Chinna.

511
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:03,080
Listen to me.

512
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:06,851
''Ready, shoot. ''

513
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:13,363
Hey! Hey!
- O God!

514
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:15,125
Pack up!

515
00:46:18,205 --> 00:46:19,263
Get up.

516
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,872
You are still young
enough to drink milk.

517
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:24,301
You haven't become big
enough to come to the bar. .

518
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:25,469
. . and drink beer with us.

519
00:46:27,514 --> 00:46:30,108
Does everyone in your
family think that l am. .

520
00:46:30,217 --> 00:46:32,378
. . some idiot in Vijayawada?

521
00:46:32,886 --> 00:46:35,286
Yesterday your brother
with a gang and threatened. .

522
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:38,380
. . to burn this place and today
you came with another gang. .

523
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:43,259
''. . to shatter this place?
Hey, you think l am some idiot?''

524
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:44,990
You think l am some idiot?

525
00:46:56,343 --> 00:46:58,243
You doubt if the
bullet entered your body.

526
00:46:58,345 --> 00:46:59,869
''That will happen in
the next round, buddy. ''

527
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,345
This is just warm-up.

528
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:04,140
This place is stinking
of pee. Get it cleaned.

529
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:11,254
''And yes, what did
my brother warn you?''

530
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:21,189
Who is this heroine introduced. .

531
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:26,762
. . in a super successful film
last year? - Have it. Have it.

532
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:29,467
You wake up in the morning and
eat Attulu and parched rice. .

533
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:33,808
. . and read about
that beautiful heroine.

534
00:47:33,914 --> 00:47:35,882
And whenever you feel
bored shake your waist a bit. .

535
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:38,473
. . and roam on the road
calling yourself youth president.

536
00:47:38,585 --> 00:47:41,053
''Get lost, you. . You have
been in politics for 30 years. . ''

537
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:45,181
''. . but you couldn't even protect
your brother's bar, you idiot. ''

538
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:48,284
''What happened, kid brother?
Why are you shouting. . ''

539
00:47:48,395 --> 00:47:50,886
. . without telling me
what the matter is?

540
00:47:50,997 --> 00:47:53,465
When you get a
newspaper instead of reading. .

541
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:55,933
. . useless news you must read
the headlines on front page.

542
00:47:56,303 --> 00:47:58,066
''Brother-in-law, you
don't know this, do you?''

543
00:47:58,238 --> 00:48:02,140
MLA's son burned
down your brother's bar.

544
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:05,034
He is getting aggressive as
he doesn't know everything. .

545
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:08,137
. . but he can't do anything
even if he knows about it.

546
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:10,216
You have been blowing the
balloon of the same party. .

547
00:48:10,317 --> 00:48:13,377
''. . for 30 years, but till now
you couldn't even get one ticket. ''

548
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:16,478
And do you really need
brokerage after all this?

549
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,118
l am ashamed to tell
anyone that l am your brother.

550
00:48:20,994 --> 00:48:23,861
''Brother-in-law Bangaru,
will you wash your face. . ''

551
00:48:23,964 --> 00:48:26,125
. . or will you
maintain it for effect?

552
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:32,130
''You are making fun of me,
idiot? Ok, keep on doing it. ''

553
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:35,230
One day this comedy
character will become serious. .

554
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:37,833
. . and the lives of serious
characters will become a joke.

555
00:48:37,944 --> 00:48:39,070
Just keep watching.

556
00:48:39,412 --> 00:48:40,606
He wants to be a gang leader.

557
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:45,579
''Hey, you idiot! Since when
are you up to all these things?''

558
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:47,409
Father.
- Drinking. Fighting.

559
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,545
''Stop it, father. - Worthless
friends. Worthless deeds. ''

560
00:48:49,656 --> 00:48:50,953
l pay hundreds of
thousands of rupees as donation. .

561
00:48:51,057 --> 00:48:53,025
. . and get you
admission in college for this?

562
00:48:53,126 --> 00:48:54,855
''Father, stop it. l'm the
one who sent men to that bar. ''

563
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:56,121
''Hey, instead of
scolding him as a brother. . ''

564
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:58,595
''. . you are supporting him. l
will kill him. - Stop, father. ''

565
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:01,290
l am the one who sent
Basha to burn down the bar.

566
00:49:01,401 --> 00:49:02,459
You can ask him.

567
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,435
He happened to be there at
that time unfortunately.

568
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:07,563
''That's all.
- l am going. . - Come on, father. ''

569
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:09,564
Enough of whatever you did.

570
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:11,644
Now it's up to you if
you will study abroad. .

571
00:49:11,945 --> 00:49:14,175
. . or take care of business here.
l need an answer in a week.

572
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:18,041
lf you don't stop
doing such idiotic things. .

573
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:20,244
''. . l will break your hands and legs.
- Come on, father. ''

574
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:23,212
''Father, what's the difference
between that guy burning it. . ''

575
00:49:23,323 --> 00:49:26,918
. . and me burning it?
- What did you say again?

576
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:30,454
lf you talk without respect
again l am going to kill you.

577
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:32,528
''Come on, father.
- Hey, you leave me. ''

578
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:34,599
He does it after thinking
it about it a great deal. .

579
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:37,397
. . and you do it in the fit of rage.
That's the difference.

580
00:49:39,305 --> 00:49:41,000
Enough of roaming around.
Ask him to take care of. .

581
00:49:41,107 --> 00:49:43,268
. . the accounts in the
restaurant from tomorrow onwards.

582
00:49:43,443 --> 00:49:45,138
lt will mend his ways.

583
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:53,412
You could've called me and told me. .

584
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,578
. . before things reached this point.

585
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:57,546
The elections are nearing.
That's why he is a bit tensed.

586
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:00,422
Your drink's stink is
reaching downstairs.

587
00:50:02,462 --> 00:50:03,952
First go and take bath.

588
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:16,372
lf you bite the
hand that feeds you. .

589
00:50:16,476 --> 00:50:19,468
''. . it can even strangle
you to death, Naidu. ''

590
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:23,607
First you destroyed my political
career and now you ruined. .

591
00:50:23,717 --> 00:50:30,020
. . my brother's life.
My anger has hit the ceiling.

592
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:33,115
This time l will put my
entire property at stake.

593
00:50:33,226 --> 00:50:37,253
lf you can try to
get the party's ticket.

594
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:42,492
lt's better to have
such cunning fox. .

595
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:44,331
''. . in enemy's camp rather
than in our camp, father. ''

596
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:46,572
You saw in last election how
he created troubles for us. .

597
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:48,197
. . in spite of being by our side.

598
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:51,436
l am not thinking
about that buffoon.

599
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:54,538
But about the cancer
growing in our house.

600
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:57,106
Watching you and
me now Chinna also. .

601
00:50:57,217 --> 00:50:59,014
. . showing interest
to enter this field.

602
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,078
Every child born to a
politician grows with those dreams.

603
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,385
When they get a couple
of cronies around them. .

604
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:08,188
. . they think of
themselves as leaders.

605
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,028
lf there will be another leader
in this house it should be you.

606
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,733
You are a born leader.

607
00:51:16,436 --> 00:51:17,994
He is not cut out for this.

608
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:33,217
Greetings to party youth.

609
00:51:34,287 --> 00:51:39,418
Today we have gathered
here in this star hotel. .

610
00:51:39,526 --> 00:51:42,654
Cut. Cut. Cut. His mannerisms
are like that of a eunuch.

611
00:51:43,062 --> 00:51:45,087
lt's alright. We will get
women's votes as they will. .

612
00:51:45,198 --> 00:51:47,166
. . think he is a woman in a
man's body. - Then it's ok.

613
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:49,235
But your language is quite mellow.

614
00:51:49,335 --> 00:51:52,327
''Let's change it,
brother-in-law. Ready. Action. ''

615
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:55,631
Greetings to the gathering.

616
00:51:56,142 --> 00:51:58,235
Brothers and sisters. .

617
00:51:58,578 --> 00:52:02,446
''You boys and girls, the
future of this party. . ''

618
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:03,709
Will you bang your thigh now?

619
00:52:04,484 --> 00:52:05,781
They sound like a drama's dialogues.

620
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:09,684
When he moves in that way
the focus goes on to the belly.

621
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:13,418
You idiots! You find
faults in whichever way l speak.

622
00:52:14,294 --> 00:52:17,559
Stop worrying me here and tell
me party workers have arrived.

623
00:52:17,664 --> 00:52:19,427
They arrived a long ago.
They are having breakfast. .

624
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:20,794
. . in the lawn.
- Of course they will eat.

625
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,362
''But we arranged for
the meals here, right?''

626
00:52:22,468 --> 00:52:25,335
They will continue having
breakfast till lunch time. You. .

627
00:52:25,438 --> 00:52:26,666
Go and call them.

628
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,402
What we are about to
talk about right now is. .

629
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:11,882
. . we need a great change in
our constituency's leadership.

630
00:53:13,419 --> 00:53:16,718
ln order to get back
our party's lost glory. .

631
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:20,850
ln order to win the election and
bring back the party to the rule. .

632
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:27,258
. . all of us must. .
- Hello! First serve the meals.

633
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:29,528
We can get done with the lunch
along with listening to you.

634
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:30,762
''What do you say, Som Babu?''

635
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:35,538
He is not NTR or
Megastar . .

636
00:53:35,642 --> 00:53:38,634
. . that we would hear him
without moving our heads.

637
00:53:39,345 --> 00:53:42,781
''You are right, Som Babu.
We shall do the needful. ''

638
00:53:42,882 --> 00:53:44,850
''Ok, go ahead. You continue with it. ''

639
00:53:44,951 --> 00:53:46,919
We are all ears. Actually
Balayya's movie is releasing.

640
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,346
We are getting late
for the matinee show.

641
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:49,512
''That's how they talk,
brother-in-law. ''

642
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,782
Come to the point
before the matinee begins.

643
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:55,393
''Friends, what l am
saying right now is that. . ''

644
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:10,906
''Even after doing all this,
what has the party done for me?''

645
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,235
''Hit the table slowly, or
else the bottles will break. ''

646
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:17,305
lf it breaks l will get
another one. You continue.

647
00:54:28,294 --> 00:54:32,822
''Brother-in-law Bangaru,
now stop wavering. ''

648
00:54:32,932 --> 00:54:34,900
Tell me what we have to do.
- You all must go on a strike. .

649
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,969
. . demanding a seat
for my brother-in-law.

650
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,830
''Hey, you! Do we look like fools?''

651
00:54:39,939 --> 00:54:43,773
Do you think we will trade
our conscience for a meal?

652
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:45,434
What do you think?
- Let it be.

653
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:48,537
''We are getting late for
the matinee, Som Babu. ''

654
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:51,845
Think twice before
making a proposal.

655
00:54:52,352 --> 00:54:54,752
For succeed in politics one
must either have charisma. .

656
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:57,846
. . or money in hand.
You have got neither.

657
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:03,218
Our reception was a waste.

658

''You wait a minute, brother-in-law.
l will bring them back. ''

659
00:55:05,398 --> 00:55:08,595

My brother-in-law
doesn't even have a family.

666
00:55:25,785 --> 00:55:28,253
''He won't take along his wealth
with him after his death, right?''

667
00:55:28,354 --> 00:55:30,322

''Sorry, guys. l am late. ''

683
00:56:09,862 --> 00:56:11,454
What's this! The cake is so big.

684
00:56:11,564 --> 00:56:12,622
That's what l am worried about.

685
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:16,031
They said if there are personal
guests we can't serve liquor.

686
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,666
l will hit you. Who told you that?

687

You can go to another restaurant.

When did you join the restaurant?
- One week.

00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:37,515
So you never saw that
photo in this one week?

''And by the way, you are fired.
You go to some other restaurant. ''

comes to file his nomination. .

821
01:06:04,232 --> 01:06:05,358
. . time will be up.

822
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,334
You can quit politics and with a
couple of girls in Filmnagar. .

823
01:06:10,438 --> 01:06:11,928
. . you can shoot films.

824
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:15,073
''You won't be a secretary
for too long anyway, right?''

825
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,405
But where did you
get so much money from?

826
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:21,910
The one who has been in
politics for 25 years. .

827
01:06:22,016 --> 01:06:24,075
. . is bound to have that much money.

828
01:06:24,352 --> 01:06:29,153
Did you think he brought
it from Basi Reddy? - Hey!

829
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,418
ls it black money?

830
01:06:36,197 --> 01:06:38,222
Can't you see his color?

831
01:06:39,033 --> 01:06:42,434
''And also, no one gave so
many notes for a single note. ''

832
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:44,297
You broke all records.

833
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:52,103
lf you throw some money they
will even felicitate a donkey.

834
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:55,415
Selfless workers can't
survive in this day and age.

835
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:57,876
People out there quite selfish.

836
01:06:59,387 --> 01:07:01,218
''Your anger makes no sense, Dharma. ''

837
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:04,720
Selfishness is a human
being's real nature.

838
01:07:05,793 --> 01:07:07,818
Selflessness is a mere mask.

839
01:07:14,335 --> 01:07:17,133
ls your father in a
condition to pick the phone?

840
01:07:17,238 --> 01:07:19,035
lt depends on the idiot who calls.

841
01:07:20,408 --> 01:07:25,402
He lost his ticket to a buffoon.
My sympathies are with you.

842
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:29,040
Keep some of it with you. You
will need it post-elections.

843
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:32,853
Your father taught you to
keep confidence in tact. .

844
01:07:32,954 --> 01:07:34,922
. . even while losing.
- The difference between. .

845
01:07:35,022 --> 01:07:38,958
''. . a winner and a loser is the
confidence itself, Masi Reddy. ''

846
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:41,453
l will give you some free advice.

847
01:07:43,064 --> 01:07:47,330
Don't let your father go
outside till the nominations. .

848
01:07:47,435 --> 01:07:53,237
. . are filed tomorrow. His
planets are not in right position.

849
01:08:25,807 --> 01:08:26,933
Father. Father.

850
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,501
Hey! Hey!

851
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:33,976
Basha. Dharma.

852
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:39,215
''Hey! - Dharma, hold him.
Stop the blood flow. ''

853
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:29,502
We have to send boys
to bump off Bangaru.

854
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:31,902
''Hey, who asked you to go after him?''

855
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,137
This is Basi Reddy's conspiracy.

856
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:37,877
He knows we would win
even if we go independent.

857
01:09:39,046 --> 01:09:42,106
With the help of the
nomination he wanted to take. .

858
01:09:42,216 --> 01:09:45,208
''. . Bangaru on his side, so that
he can clean up the opposition. ''

859
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:47,287
Then l will kill him.
- Hey! lf any one of you touches. .

860
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:51,586
. . the knife till the
elections are over l will kill you.

861
01:10:03,571 --> 01:10:04,629
You got them?

862
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:06,631
l killed them.

863
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,341
Before police comes
here go to your village.

864
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:12,070
Father is fine now.

865
01:10:17,285 --> 01:10:19,549
''Mark 1 : 34 degrees horizontal,

866
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:22,646

''Third mark is close to the liver.
- Thank you, madam. ''

868
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:26,417
Thank you.

869
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:30,427
The bullet missed the chest.

870
01:10:31,165 --> 01:10:33,190
l think he will be ok.
You did the right thing. .

871
01:10:33,301 --> 01:10:35,269
. . by bringing him here
without losing too much blood.

872
01:10:35,636 --> 01:10:36,898
Take care of him.

873
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:48,911
You idiots! He was attacked
in the middle of the streets. .

874
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:51,644
. . in broad daylight.
What were you doing?

875
01:10:52,286 --> 01:10:56,484
Eating. Drinking. Sleeping.
That's what you do? ldiots.

876
01:10:57,525 --> 01:11:01,222
l should blame my father first.
He feeds these idiots.

877
01:11:01,362 --> 01:11:05,230
''Hey, all you old foxes can
take retirement and go home. ''

878
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,301
l know how to take care
of my father's security.

879
01:11:08,169 --> 01:11:09,431
What will you take care of?

880
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:12,697
Who among them looks
like his bodyguard. .

881
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:15,134
. . who works for salary?
Look at their faces once.

882
01:11:16,043 --> 01:11:17,203
They are not roadside
goons who follow you. .

883
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:18,369
. . for liquor and Biryani.

884
01:11:20,314 --> 01:11:22,214
They are idiots who put
their lives at stake for him. .

885
01:11:22,316 --> 01:11:23,442
. . who did something
for them ages ago.

886
01:11:25,353 --> 01:11:28,220
They ignore their home
and guard our homes.

887
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:30,651
With which program will you
compensate for their jobs?

888
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:36,453
They are not like you idiotic
cronies. - Stop your rubbish!

889
01:11:36,564 --> 01:11:39,294
Enough of raising your voice.
Now lower it. Lower it.

890
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:42,434
And why you behaving as
if you are his real son?

891
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:45,163
l am that father's real son.

892
01:11:47,274 --> 01:11:50,334
Either in politics
or for succession. .

893

894
01:11:55,182 --> 01:11:56,547

minutes' time to understand that. .

''. . these are just words of
aggression, not sensible words. ''

896

Get rid of that itch in your mind.

01:12:02,423 --> 01:12:03,981
Or else what will you do?
What will you do?

What will you do? What
will you do? Tell me.

You haven't seen this
brother before. Listen to me.

900

This is not some itch that
l acquire a few days back.

and now it reached my head.

Will you contest in
my place this time?

On a donkey. On a donkey.

This is Kadapa's bomb.
This is Mangampeta's granite.

998
01:17:59,013 --> 01:18:01,379
Put this in your mouth and
put this somewhere else.

''Come on, let's go.
Sir needs to take rest. ''

You don't get

The more you say 'no' the
more l get interested in it.

1043
01:20:25,092 --> 01:20:26,150
Then give it a try.

1044
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:29,152
But you won't get my support.

1045
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:33,757

''. . someone else's son.
Loki, you rogue!''

. . you also need
attention and ambition.

So he is more important
to you now. You idiot.

He grew right in front of
our house and threw me out.

You idiots! You just drink
and eat and live off me.

''Chinna, why are you
becoming like this?''

1109

My mother wanted to kill
me when l was in her womb.

1110
01:26:38,525 --> 01:26:41,517
Sister treated me
like an untouchable.

''l feel scared to see the
sky in darkness, grandpa. ''

Even though there
are so many stars. .

1137
01:28:41,939 --> 01:28:42,997
. . it's the darkness
that wins eventually.

1138
01:28:44,008 --> 01:28:46,738
Darkness is also a
fire that has doused.

1139

A human being too from
his birth to his death. .

Some people burn everything
that they touch with that fire. .

1144

. . and turn into demons.

1145
01:29:10,001 --> 01:29:13,300
And some others use that
fire to search the wisdom. .

the rest of the world.

Give some water. Give some water.

1151
01:29:46,837 --> 01:29:47,895
Give some water. Give some water.

1152
01:29:48,606 --> 01:29:53,009
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.

1153
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,045
Hey! Hey! Drive faster.

1154
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:02,308
''Give her the injection.
- Shut up, you idiot!''

1155
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:04,986
''Hey, stop it! Get rid of
her first. Stop the vehicle. ''

1156
01:30:05,089 --> 01:30:09,082
Stop the vehicle first. Stop it.

1157
01:30:21,705 --> 01:30:24,936
Buddy. .
- You idiot.

1158
01:30:32,316 --> 01:30:35,149
''Hey, you gave her the injection?''

1159
01:30:35,252 --> 01:30:37,345
''The dose that you gave her,
first-timers won't survive. ''

1160
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:38,746
Think of some other plan.

1161
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:41,849
This is what happens if
you experiment too much. .

1162
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:43,017
. . with different sort of drugs.

1163
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,125
''Hey, no! This may
become a murder case. ''

1164
01:30:45,229 --> 01:30:46,958
What we did till now is no
less than a murder case.

1165
01:30:47,064 --> 01:30:49,089
''Chinna, she won't survive anyway. ''

1166
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,095
lf she escapes alive all
of us will be arrested. .

1167
01:30:51,202 --> 01:30:54,194
''. . in drugs' case and rape case,
like in Pratyusha case. ''

1168
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,263
But who went to jail
in Pratyusha case?

1169
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,967
You don't know anything.
Shut up! ldiot.

1170
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:03,710
Stop. - Stop. Listen. -
lf he turns into ash. .

1171
01:31:03,814 --> 01:31:05,782
. . we have 50% chance of escaping.

1172
01:31:05,883 --> 01:31:07,214
''Chinna, don't listen to him. ''

1173
01:31:08,419 --> 01:31:11,411
Or else 100% we will turn into ash.

1174
01:31:12,022 --> 01:31:14,047
''Chinna, no. No, Chinna. ''

1175
01:31:16,227 --> 01:31:22,325
''Hey, no!
- Chinna. Chinna. ''

1176
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:26,164
Move aside.
- Just do it. - Stop.

1177
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:31,170
''No, Chinna.
- Come on. ''

1178
01:31:31,275 --> 01:31:35,974
''Chinna, you go and
file a missing complaint. . ''

1179
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,878
. . in the police station and
we will manage the waiter.

1180
01:31:40,484 --> 01:31:41,746
Let's go.

1181
01:31:57,368 --> 01:32:02,465
And people are following you
as they see that guiding light.

1182
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:07,210
Now it's up to you if you
see your gain in their faith. .

1183
01:32:07,311 --> 01:32:10,303
. . or if you understand
your responsibility. .

1184
01:32:10,414 --> 01:32:13,042
. . and burn like a guiding light.

1185
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:24,487
. . on the outskirts of Vijayawada.

1186
01:32:24,594 --> 01:32:27,529
A Tata Sumo was burning at
-10 feet from this dead body.

1187
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:29,689
According to the locals this
incident must've taken place. .

1188
01:32:29,799 --> 01:32:32,791
''. . after midnight. Along with
cameraman Ram, it's Shiv. . ''

1189
01:32:37,006 --> 01:32:41,102
My left profile is a bit fat.
Place cameras on the right.

1190
01:32:43,613 --> 01:32:46,673
Whoever is responsible
for this atrocity on. .

1191
01:32:46,783 --> 01:32:48,751
. . this innocent girl's life will
be caught and punished severely.

1192
01:32:49,118 --> 01:32:53,555
Our department won't rest in
peace till we catch the killer.

1193
01:32:56,025 --> 01:32:58,118
The Sumo is registered
on our MLA's son's name.

1194
01:32:58,227 --> 01:32:59,489
Our MLA?

1195
01:33:01,731 --> 01:33:04,461
''Sir, you think this is just
a murder or rape and murder?''

1196
01:33:04,567 --> 01:33:07,559
''Hey, if a girl is found dead by
the roadside with ruffled hair. . ''

1197
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:09,638
. . can't you think of anything else. .

1198
01:33:09,739 --> 01:33:11,502
. . other than rapes and murders?

1199
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:13,971
lt's like reviewing a
movie by watching its poster.

1200
01:33:14,077 --> 01:33:15,135
Go away. Go away.

1201
01:33:19,182 --> 01:33:22,208
''Sir, there's a problem. l
need to meet you urgently. ''

1202
01:33:28,558 --> 01:33:30,583
What's the matter? Has
something happened to Chinna?

1203
01:33:30,693 --> 01:33:32,593
Nothing happened to him. But
we must punish ourselves. .

1204
01:33:32,695 --> 01:33:33,957
. . for being his parents.
- Where is Chinna?

1205
01:33:34,063 --> 01:33:35,758
Send our men and
find out where he is.

1206
01:33:36,899 --> 01:33:40,062
l knew he would do something
when he challenged me and left.

1207
01:33:42,805 --> 01:33:43,965
The body went for post-mortem. .

1208
01:33:44,073 --> 01:33:45,165
''. . even before we got the lead, sir. ''

1209
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:47,805
Or else the matter would've
been in our control by now.

1210
01:33:51,247 --> 01:33:52,509
Who is the girl?

1211
01:34:05,762 --> 01:34:06,990
''The body is sent
for post-mortem, sir. ''

1212
01:34:54,644 --> 01:34:56,976
''lf you have any problem, do
not do the post-mortem, madam. ''

1213
01:34:57,313 --> 01:34:59,838
This is a gutter of a place.

1214
01:35:00,116 --> 01:35:03,643
lf you don't be
insensitive it's hard to work here.

1215
01:35:04,921 --> 01:35:08,550
Madam. Madam. . - What do
you think. . - What is. .

1216
01:35:08,658 --> 01:35:13,721
Can you tell us. . - Madam.

1217
01:35:24,841 --> 01:35:26,274
''My life is in this report, sister. ''

1218
01:35:30,813 --> 01:35:31,871
lt's you?

1219
01:35:33,316 --> 01:35:34,783
''Security, please. .
- Sister. Sister. Please, sister. ''

1220
01:35:34,884 --> 01:35:37,614
''Sister. Sister. Please. My life,
sister. . Sister, please. ''

1221
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,814
''Sister, l swear l
didn't do it intentionally. ''

1222
01:35:40,923 --> 01:35:42,220
l loved Navi a lot.

1223
01:35:43,259 --> 01:35:45,022
''lt happened under the
influence of alcohol, sister. ''

1224
01:35:45,862 --> 01:35:47,659
''We tried our best
to save her, sister. ''

1225
01:35:48,631 --> 01:35:49,689
But we couldn't.

1226
01:35:49,932 --> 01:35:52,924
''Sister, please. My life
is in your hands, sister. ''

1227
01:35:53,803 --> 01:35:54,861
''Sister, please. ''

1228
01:35:55,171 --> 01:35:56,604
''Please write 'drug
reaction' in the report, sister. ''

1229
01:35:56,706 --> 01:35:59,334
''Please save me,
sister. Please, sister. ''

1230
01:36:00,176 --> 01:36:02,610
''We are born to the
same mother, sister. ''

1231
01:36:02,778 --> 01:36:05,679
Right now it's not our
mother who is in front of me.

1232
01:36:05,948 --> 01:36:08,644
You sinner. Are you a
human being or an animal?

1233
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:11,083
How could you do such
a thing! How could you!

1234
01:36:11,387 --> 01:36:12,718
How could you do such a thing!

1235
01:36:13,823 --> 01:36:15,290
Get lost from here. Get lost.

1236
01:36:23,232 --> 01:36:26,065
You devil! You have been like
this ever since we were kids.

1237
01:36:26,169 --> 01:36:27,830
You always hated me.

1238
01:36:27,937 --> 01:36:30,770
Now that you got a
chance you want to destroy me.

1239
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,174
''l am your brother
after all, you devil. ''

1240
01:36:34,177 --> 01:36:35,235
Even if you walk
the path of justice. .

1241
01:36:35,344 --> 01:36:37,141
. . will that girl come back to life?

1242
01:36:38,681 --> 01:36:41,206
My misfortune. There are
hundreds of doctors in this city. .

1243
01:36:41,317 --> 01:36:44,115
. . but my case came to you.

1244
01:36:48,157 --> 01:36:50,022
My misfortune! My misfortune!
My misfortune!

1245
01:36:52,895 --> 01:36:54,920
Hey! How did l harm you!

1246
01:36:55,031 --> 01:36:58,091
Why are you all doing
this to me? Tell me.

1247
01:36:58,334 --> 01:37:00,700
''Hey, l will kill you.
- Take him away. ''

1248
01:37:05,975 --> 01:37:07,033
Hey!

1249
01:37:15,318 --> 01:37:17,013
What have you done to my daughter!

1250
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,978
What have you done!

1251
01:37:19,088 --> 01:37:22,216
l worked for your dad
like a dog for 30 years. .

1252
01:37:26,996 --> 01:37:29,988
''You are my father's dog, not mine. ''

1253
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:33,234
''Hey, Chinna! Have you gone mad?''

1254
01:37:33,336 --> 01:37:35,770
Don't come close to me. l
will slash your throats.

1255
01:37:35,871 --> 01:37:37,031
Don't come close to me.

1256
01:37:42,511 --> 01:37:44,035
Chinna.

1257
01:37:46,782 --> 01:37:48,875
Have you gone mad?
What are you doing?

1258
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:51,016
Are you out of your mind?

1259
01:38:15,311 --> 01:38:17,006
''Greetings, Naidu! ''

1260
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:22,414
Basi 'X-mark' Reddy's
second innings have begun.

1261
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:26,481
''Your son raped her alone,
but got my son as well. . ''

1262
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:30,384
. . trapped in the murder.

1263
01:38:33,796 --> 01:38:36,128
''There is an idea to
save your son, sir. ''

1264
01:38:36,832 --> 01:38:39,096
lf we choose the
less damaging option. .

1265
01:38:39,201 --> 01:38:41,396
. . we can divert the case
right now without any confusion.

1266
01:38:42,071 --> 01:38:44,164
The sumo is
registered in Mitra's name.

1267
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:48,400
''Gowda, before l get
up go so far away. . ''

1268
01:38:48,511 --> 01:38:52,038
. . that you don't
reach my hand or sandal.

1269
01:39:01,557 --> 01:39:04,117
Every time l see the
'X' mark in mirror. .

1270
01:39:04,226 --> 01:39:07,218
. . l think of your elder son.

1271
01:39:09,098 --> 01:39:11,362
Till l get even with him. .

1272
01:39:11,467 --> 01:39:14,868
. . l feel ashamed to see myself. .

1273
01:39:17,106 --> 01:39:18,801
''. . in the mirror, sir. ''

1274
01:39:34,557 --> 01:39:40,086
''l gave birth to a sinner,
but not to his sins. ''

1275
01:39:41,097 --> 01:39:43,327
ln this unfortunate
incident l got a double blow.

1276
01:39:43,933 --> 01:39:47,960
Both the tormentor and
the victim are my kids.

1277
01:39:50,873 --> 01:39:55,367
Basha is not just a
worker for me. He is family.

1278
01:39:57,646 --> 01:40:03,084
From today onwards l have
only one son and successor. .

1279
01:40:10,126 --> 01:40:12,993
How come he has such
great command over dharma. .

1280
01:40:13,095 --> 01:40:16,587
. . even though he didn't
even pass tenth standard?

1281
01:40:18,033 --> 01:40:20,297
''l think he exercises control
on meat and alcohol, bro-in-law. ''

1282
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,902
''lt's too late for that,
brother-in-law. You carry on. ''

1283
01:40:28,377 --> 01:40:29,537
He can't have even
one meal without meat. .

1284
01:40:29,645 --> 01:40:31,875
. . and prefers alcohol to water.

1285
01:40:32,181 --> 01:40:33,580
And he wants to know about dharma.

1286
01:40:34,417 --> 01:40:37,045
''Move aside. Move aside. No. No.
- Sir, sir, sir. ''

1287
01:40:37,153 --> 01:40:38,279
''Sir, sir, sir, just one question. ''

1288
01:40:38,387 --> 01:40:40,082
Just a while ago Mr.
Gowda said that the Sumo. .

1289
01:40:40,189 --> 01:40:42,054
. . was registered on Mitra's name.

1290
01:40:42,258 --> 01:40:44,226
That means you tried to
tinker with the evidences. .

1291
01:40:44,326 --> 01:40:45,987
. . even before the
matter became public?

1292
01:40:47,696 --> 01:40:49,391
Even if anyone tries to
tinker with the evidences. .

1293
01:40:49,498 --> 01:40:53,298
. . truth comes out eventually.
- Move aside. Move aside.

1294
01:40:53,402 --> 01:40:54,562
That's why since the matter
has become public anyway. .

1295
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:57,230
. . you are trying to dramatize
the issue and win the election.

1296
01:40:57,339 --> 01:40:58,397
Am l right?

1297
01:41:01,076 --> 01:41:03,101
ln our country
election is the biggest drama?

1298
01:41:03,946 --> 01:41:05,140
People are the greatest actors.

1299
01:41:05,948 --> 01:41:09,111
They know the difference
between drama and truth.

1300
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:13,447
You can write whatever you wish.
- Move. Move aside.

1301
01:41:13,556 --> 01:41:14,614
Move aside.

1302
01:41:20,162 --> 01:41:22,687
Oh no! l have never
seen such an incident. .

1303
01:41:22,998 --> 01:41:25,990
. . where one puts one's
real son in the jail. .

1304
01:41:26,101 --> 01:41:31,061
''. . and enthrones the stepson,
except in the movies. ''

1305
01:41:31,207 --> 01:41:33,141
lt pains me even when l think of it.

1306
01:41:34,143 --> 01:41:38,011
His father is quite busy
with the election drama.

1307
01:41:38,113 --> 01:41:40,377
He can't help him
escape from this case.

1308
01:41:40,483 --> 01:41:43,384
Arrange the bail papers.
l will sign them.

1309
01:41:58,367 --> 01:42:00,631
''How is Basha?
- l can't see him, father. ''

1310
01:42:02,771 --> 01:42:04,170
He is not there
even in the hospital.

1311
01:42:10,145 --> 01:42:11,373
Basha won't leave him alive.

1312
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:15,408
He won't leave him alive.

1313
01:42:19,788 --> 01:42:23,280
A man who has been
loyal for 40 years. .

1314
01:42:23,392 --> 01:42:26,691
. . is after my son's
blood after one incident.

1315
01:42:28,764 --> 01:42:32,598
''To save Chinna you
have to lose Basha, sir. ''

1316
01:42:37,806 --> 01:42:40,639
Killing is not the
only way to save a person.

1317
01:42:42,478 --> 01:42:43,570
You mind your work.

1318
01:42:53,088 --> 01:42:54,146
''Greetings, sir.
- Where is Chinna?''

1319
01:42:54,256 --> 01:42:56,281
''Mr. Basi Reddy took him out
on bail yesterday itself, sir. ''

1320
01:42:56,392 --> 01:42:59,122
Who is he to take him out?
And how could you leave him?

1321
01:42:59,228 --> 01:43:01,253
''What's this, sir! Am l the
root case of your family drama?''

1322
01:43:01,363 --> 01:43:03,558
He came and signed the
papers and he went with him.

1323
01:43:03,666 --> 01:43:05,133
Why are you blaming me for this?
- Mitra.

1324
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:10,138
You are MLAs sons.
You can do anything.

1325
01:43:10,339 --> 01:43:12,671
You can beat the policemen
and you can commit murders.

1326
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:14,266
You have got power in your hands.

1327
01:43:20,349 --> 01:43:21,407
''Sorry, uncle. ''

1328
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,711
Though l am from Kadapa. .

1329
01:43:35,588 --> 01:43:40,582
. . l am not a ruthless man to
kill a person for a minor issue.

1330
01:43:41,927 --> 01:43:46,728
lf you won't accuse
me of creating rifts. .

1331
01:43:46,832 --> 01:43:51,701
. . tell me after your father passes
away who will benefit the most?

1332
01:43:53,038 --> 01:43:56,030
He stays in your home.

1333
01:43:56,609 --> 01:44:02,479
He made his move right
before the nomination was filed.

1334
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:07,610
He would have become an MLA on
sympathy wave just like that.

1335
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:12,521
l didn't see such
conspirators even in TV serials.

1336
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:15,893
They got a chance and
that brother and sister. .

1337
01:44:15,995 --> 01:44:18,896
. . have completely ruined your life.

1338
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:22,362
l will do my best to get you out.

1339
01:44:23,002 --> 01:44:27,462
But the report your
sister has prepared. .

1340
01:44:27,573 --> 01:44:32,476
. . is a major hurdle for us.

1341
01:44:33,979 --> 01:44:37,813
Even if you escape
this case you have got. .

1342
01:44:37,917 --> 01:44:41,944
. . nothing is left for you.
When he becomes a leader. .

1343
01:44:42,054 --> 01:44:45,046
. . you will keep hailing
'long live brother Mitra'. .

1344
01:44:45,157 --> 01:44:48,058
. . 'long live brother Mitra' and
be his subordinate all your life.

1345
01:44:48,727 --> 01:44:52,493
That's final. Have a
couple of drinks for now. .

1346
01:44:52,598 --> 01:44:55,931
. . and have a sound sleep.
Sleep for now. Sleep for now.

1347
01:45:02,942 --> 01:45:04,910
ln the forthcoming elections
the current district MLA. .

1348
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:06,978
. . Lokanatham is
trailing behind with 12%. .

1349
01:45:07,079 --> 01:45:09,047
. . in the recent polls to his
nearest rival even though. .

1350
01:45:09,148 --> 01:45:11,639
. . his party is leading in the
remaining parts of the state.

1351
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:14,412
According to the experts
this political warhorse. .

1352
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:18,012
. . will definitely face defeat this
winner of four previous elections.

1353
01:45:18,123 --> 01:45:19,590
The chief reason seems to
be his son's involvement. .

1354
01:45:19,692 --> 01:45:22,456
. . in a murder case.

1355
01:45:22,561 --> 01:45:23,619
''Sir, phone. . ''

1356
01:45:28,434 --> 01:45:30,868
''Are you a bit worried, brother?''

1357
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:33,531
You want to know
about your younger tiger?

1358
01:45:33,639 --> 01:45:37,166
l brought your younger
tiger out of the cell. .

1359
01:45:37,476 --> 01:45:41,913
. . and kept him in my cage.
lt is very disturbed mentally.

1360
01:45:42,214 --> 01:45:45,775
''lf l unleash it, it will
bite whichever throat it sees. . ''

1361
01:45:45,884 --> 01:45:47,476
. . including yours.

1362
01:45:48,187 --> 01:45:52,715
''Look, Naidu, l always
support the ruling party. ''

1363
01:45:52,825 --> 01:45:56,056
Your party will
definitely win this election.

1364
01:45:56,562 --> 01:46:01,966
Even now your victory is more
beneficial to me than your defeat.

1365
01:46:02,835 --> 01:46:04,564
Let's join forces at least now.

1366
01:46:05,137 --> 01:46:08,595
With my muscle power
and financial power. .

1367
01:46:08,707 --> 01:46:13,041
''. . l can change the scenario in
no time, l swear on granite. ''

1368
01:46:20,819 --> 01:46:21,877
''Basha, take out the car. ''

1369
01:46:23,722 --> 01:46:25,553
Basha.
- Sir. .

1370
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:56,582
lt's him. Come on.

1371
01:47:36,161 --> 01:47:37,219
''Hey, stop!''

1372
01:47:37,362 --> 01:47:39,592
The silent operation will
turn into communal fight.

1373
01:47:40,599 --> 01:47:42,066
This dog can't escape.

1374
01:47:42,735 --> 01:47:43,997
lt can't go out of this area.

1375
01:47:44,336 --> 01:47:45,598
Keep your gun inside and move.

1376
01:48:26,111 --> 01:48:27,908
''They are throwing 1000
rupees for every vote, sir. ''

1377
01:48:28,313 --> 01:48:30,213
lf we don't throw money
we will be in trouble.

1378
01:48:31,049 --> 01:48:34,610
lt will save at least two
weeks' petrol. - What do you mean?

1379
01:48:35,988 --> 01:48:38,183
''We won't survive in politics
if we are too righteous, sir. ''

1380
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:39,689
''How did we survive till now, Durga?''

1381
01:48:39,792 --> 01:48:40,952
''This election is different, sir. ''

1382
01:48:43,028 --> 01:48:44,893
How many voters are
there in our constituency?

1383
01:48:44,997 --> 01:48:48,057
''At most 300,000. - How many
of them come to the booth?''

1384
01:48:49,067 --> 01:48:51,035
''About 200,000.
- ln the remaining 100,000. . ''

1385
01:48:51,136 --> 01:48:52,933
''. . there will be at least

1386
01:48:56,308 --> 01:48:59,368
''. . to the booth.
- That's not possible, sir. ''

1387
01:48:59,878 --> 01:49:01,743
Everything seems
like juvenile politics.

1388
01:49:02,114 --> 01:49:05,709
Shut up! lf you can't do it
shut your mouth and stay at home.

1389
01:49:06,318 --> 01:49:08,081
You guys are lazy and stupid.

1390
01:49:08,687 --> 01:49:09,745
And think of taking wrong paths.

1391
01:49:10,222 --> 01:49:11,814
Such people don't
have a place in my camp.

1392
01:49:12,157 --> 01:49:15,024
''Don't talk like that,
sir. ln last elections. . ''

1393
01:49:15,127 --> 01:49:17,095
. . even though our party's
condition was pathetic. .

1394
01:49:17,196 --> 01:49:19,892
''. . we helped it win
with 100,000 majority. ''

1395
01:49:20,299 --> 01:49:21,357
''This election is different, sir. ''

1396
01:49:22,067 --> 01:49:24,228
People have forgotten all
the good deeds we have done.

1397
01:49:25,304 --> 01:49:28,171
They don't remember
anything except what Chinna did.

1398
01:49:28,774 --> 01:49:32,710
''lf we lose the
elections l will die, sir. ''

1399
01:49:35,247 --> 01:49:37,875
''l will die, sir. l will die.
- Durga. ''

1400
01:49:39,084 --> 01:49:40,142
Durga.

1401
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:42,177
Durga!

1402
01:49:43,255 --> 01:49:45,223
One should cry not while competing. .

1403
01:49:45,324 --> 01:49:46,382
. . but while one is
still a human being.

1404
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,257
Don't forget that
you are also a leader.

1405
01:49:52,164 --> 01:49:53,290
Sit down. Sit down.

1406
01:49:53,398 --> 01:49:56,128
''Mitra, some party workers have some
questions regarding the posters. ''

1407
01:49:56,301 --> 01:49:57,359
Go and take care of them.

1408
01:50:01,306 --> 01:50:03,866
Leave the campaign of the
last two weeks to me. Go.

1409
01:50:04,142 --> 01:50:05,200
Dharma.

1410
01:50:12,885 --> 01:50:13,943
Durga.
- Sir.

1411
01:50:15,921 --> 01:50:17,388
How many voters are
there in your panchayat?

1412
01:50:17,789 --> 01:50:19,051
''About 25,000, sir. ''

1413
01:50:20,993 --> 01:50:22,051
Will this be enough?

1414
01:50:33,772 --> 01:50:35,467
''Do we have to fear
defeat so much, father?''

1415
01:50:38,443 --> 01:50:41,071
Politics is like riding a tiger.

1416
01:50:42,214 --> 01:50:44,148
Once we get on it we can't get down.

1417
01:50:44,883 --> 01:50:45,975
We can't survive.

1418
01:51:05,237 --> 01:51:06,499
As elections are nearing
in Gannavaram constituency. .

1419
01:51:06,805 --> 01:51:08,773
. . the contest
between Lokanatham and. .

1420
01:51:08,874 --> 01:51:10,899
. . Partha Sarathi is
intensifying with each passing day.

1421
01:51:11,209 --> 01:51:14,144
Experts are unable to
predict who is going to win.

1422
01:51:14,513 --> 01:51:16,003
There are whispers that Lokanatham. .

1423
01:51:16,114 --> 01:51:19,015
. . is also taking some incorrect
measures to win this election.

1424
01:51:20,452 --> 01:51:23,114
This evening the counting is
about to begin all over the state.

1425
01:51:23,355 --> 01:51:25,323
The election commissioner
said that by tomorrow morning. .

1426
01:51:25,424 --> 01:51:26,482
. . the results will be out.

1427
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,359
What's the matter? Has your
brother-in-law bought Benz?

1428
01:51:29,494 --> 01:51:31,359
l don't know.
- Did you guys pay the dowry late?

1429
01:51:31,463 --> 01:51:32,828
lnstallment lndian.

1430
01:51:33,131 --> 01:51:36,191
'l am the path. l am life.
l am the ultimate truth. '

1431
01:51:37,336 --> 01:51:39,361
l know you are Benz. Mercedes Benz.

1432
01:51:40,105 --> 01:51:43,097
Even if you are Benz you
shouldn't be so arrogant.

1433
01:51:43,208 --> 01:51:45,438
You mean other cars are not cars?
Are they bullock-carts?

1434
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:47,938
l am the path. l am the life.

1435
01:51:48,847 --> 01:51:50,178
''Buddy, l think there's
some religious fanatic inside. ''

1436
01:51:50,282 --> 01:51:51,544
lf we go inside we
will be converted.

1437
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:53,010
Let's go and hide
in the nearby temple

1438
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:54,176
lf you have faith in your faith. .

1439
01:51:54,286 --> 01:51:55,878
. . you won't be worried
about your conversions.

1440
01:51:56,989 --> 01:51:58,820
And what's wrong with
you guys? You look as if. .

1441
01:51:58,924 --> 01:51:59,982
. . it's Monday morning and
you have to go to school?

1442
01:52:00,092 --> 01:52:01,252
Have they also converted?

1443
01:52:02,627 --> 01:52:09,157
''Uncle, someone came from
America to marry sister. ''

1444
01:52:09,601 --> 01:52:12,161
What? - Same old story.

1445
01:52:12,571 --> 01:52:15,267
''Sister, with whose
permission did you set this match?''

1446
01:52:15,474 --> 01:52:18,272
Have you forgotten
that l am there for her?

1447
01:52:18,377 --> 01:52:19,571
Oh! They can hear you.

1448
01:52:19,878 --> 01:52:23,939
l too want him to leave.
- So nice.

1449
01:52:24,216 --> 01:52:27,617
God made you very beautiful.
- Thank you.

1450
01:52:27,919 --> 01:52:30,114
Thank you very much.
- What's wrong with him?

1451
01:52:30,288 --> 01:52:32,119
l thought he doesn't
belong to our religion. .

1452
01:52:32,224 --> 01:52:34,089
. . but he doesn't
even look like us. Oh!

1453
01:52:34,226 --> 01:52:36,319
His father is from Andhra
and mother is an American.

1454
01:52:36,628 --> 01:52:38,323
Your brother-in-law wants to
send her away to America. .

1455
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:39,624
. . no matter however her in-laws are.

1456
01:52:39,931 --> 01:52:41,956
They will definitely
be united in the climax.

1457
01:52:42,067 --> 01:52:43,125
Here is the fruit cake.

1458
01:52:43,235 --> 01:52:47,899
''Hey, go and play.
You can play this game. ''

1459
01:52:48,006 --> 01:52:49,906
Will she like him? - You
know it's enough for our girls. .

1460
01:52:50,008 --> 01:52:52,476
. . if the guy is fair. They
fall for fair guys in a second.

1461
01:52:52,677 --> 01:52:54,338
Move aside.
- You move aside.

1462
01:52:58,283 --> 01:53:00,410
''Hey, don't misbehave here. ''

1463
01:53:01,386 --> 01:53:02,444
You put your hand around me?
- Hello!

1464
01:53:03,155 --> 01:53:05,248
''John doesn't mind such things.
Right, John?''

1465
01:53:05,357 --> 01:53:06,619
Right. l am full of love.

1466
01:53:06,925 --> 01:53:09,621
You liked the white guy a lot?
- l told you about him.

1467
01:53:09,928 --> 01:53:11,987
''He's my cousin.
- Hey, nice to meet you, man. ''

1468
01:53:12,097 --> 01:53:14,190
My name is John Meyer.
God bless you.

1469
01:53:14,299 --> 01:53:16,529
l am a white skinned Telugu guy.

1470
01:53:17,235 --> 01:53:20,636
Ya. Ya. Ya. l am Mitra.
l am from Bejawada.

1471
01:53:20,939 --> 01:53:25,603
He is into hooliganism.
- Ya. l heard yours is a tough job.

1472
01:53:26,411 --> 01:53:28,379
Very tough. Without
missing the deadline. .

1473
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,448
''. . we have to oversee a fight
a day, a murder per a week. . ''

1474
01:53:30,549 --> 01:53:33,609
''. . and a rape every month, or
else we'll be considered weak. ''

1475
01:53:33,718 --> 01:53:36,653
Then you must come
to Lord's home once. .

1476
01:53:36,955 --> 01:53:38,980
. . and hear his message.
- Ok. Ok. Definitely.

1477
01:53:39,091 --> 01:53:41,355
But right now l have to
go to Superstar's movie. .

1478
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:43,121
The kids are a bit dull.

1479
01:53:44,996 --> 01:53:47,988
What have you done? You
avoided him ruthlessly.

1480
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:49,158
He hasn't done anything wrong.

1481
01:53:49,301 --> 01:53:51,929
He only fault was that he fell
for you and became a scapegoat.

1482
01:53:52,237 --> 01:53:55,229
''Uncle, you are in trouble now.
- What?''

1483
01:53:55,574 --> 01:53:59,442
You said 'l love you' to her first.
You've lost to her.

1484
01:54:00,445 --> 01:54:01,503
'And now there will be a song. '

1485
01:54:21,066 --> 01:54:25,400

deep down in my heart. ''

''l have seen your magic. ''

1501
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:06,366
''You make my heart skip a beat. ''

1502
01:56:06,471 --> 01:56:11,135
''How do l get over
this restlessness?''

1503
01:56:11,243 --> 01:56:15,577
''Even for a second. . ''

1504
01:56:15,847 --> 01:56:20,511
''l don't feel like
staying away from you. ''

l bore it even if they doubted me.

1513

l bore it even if they insulted me.

1514
01:57:07,265 --> 01:57:09,597
The love of my life. .

Mitra.
- Uncle. - Mitra. - Buddy.

1517
01:57:58,983 --> 01:58:00,541
Mitra. Mitra. Where are you?

1518
01:58:00,752 --> 01:58:02,617
You wait outside.
- Ok.

1519
01:58:32,851 --> 01:58:33,909
''Nikki, come fast. ''

1520
01:58:47,866 --> 01:58:48,924
''Hello, brother-in-law!''

1521
01:58:51,669 --> 01:58:55,332
What do you want?
- l was missing sister a bit.

1522
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:56,866
So l felt like dropping by.

1523
01:59:02,781 --> 01:59:06,808
lt's the Sunday evening.
You sent everyone out. .

1524
01:59:06,918 --> 01:59:10,285
''. . to spend quality time with
your wife? - Hey, get out now. ''

1525
01:59:10,822 --> 01:59:12,915
''l said get out of here.
Get lost, you idiot. ''

1526
01:59:13,591 --> 01:59:15,559
lt will be fine. Calm down.

1527
01:59:17,929 --> 01:59:19,260
Lift it. Lift the phone.

1528
01:59:19,364 --> 01:59:21,491
''What's this, brother-in-law,
you too treat me in this way?''

1529
01:59:22,634 --> 01:59:24,602
''l know l am step-in-law, but still. . ''

1530
01:59:24,702 --> 01:59:26,567
. . you shouldn't be
talking like that.

1531
01:59:26,671 --> 01:59:29,765
''You're psychiatrist, right? You
should treat me like a patient. ''

1532
01:59:29,874 --> 01:59:30,932
Okay?

1533
01:59:33,645 --> 01:59:35,670
Hello! Sister. Sister.

1534
01:59:36,347 --> 01:59:37,814
Sister. Sister.

1535
01:59:38,850 --> 01:59:41,614
What? You escaped alive?
- Chinna. Sister.

1536
01:59:41,719 --> 01:59:43,311
Mitra. Mitra.

1537
01:59:44,322 --> 01:59:46,552
Chinna.
- Then listen to me.

1538
01:59:46,891 --> 01:59:48,586
ln another five minutes
l will kill your sister. .

1539
01:59:48,693 --> 01:59:50,718
. . and if your brother-in-law
interferes l will kill him as well.

1540
01:59:51,563 --> 01:59:52,621
Without a miss.

1541
01:59:53,565 --> 01:59:56,864
''Chinna, don't harm sister.
- Hey! Hey! Chinna. ''

1542
01:59:56,968 --> 01:59:59,300
''Ever since childhood there's a
thorn in my heart, brother-in-law. ''

1543
02:00:00,538 --> 02:00:03,701
lt grew with age and it
infected my character.

1544
02:00:04,676 --> 02:00:07,474
Actually l left home
for its treatment.

1545
02:00:07,846 --> 02:00:09,837
''Brother-in-law, you haven't
grown up in 'action' settings. ''

1546
02:00:10,615 --> 02:00:12,014
Give it to me. Give me the bat.

1547
02:00:12,817 --> 02:00:14,717
''l will train you.
Give me, brother-in-law. ''

1548
02:00:15,453 --> 02:00:16,613
Give me. Leave it.

1549
02:00:21,993 --> 02:00:23,051
''Chinna, what are you doing there?''

1550
02:00:24,796 --> 02:00:25,854
Hey! What are you doing!

1551
02:00:28,533 --> 02:00:30,398
''Chinna, don't harm sister. Hey!''

1552
02:00:31,503 --> 02:00:33,869
We are born to the same mother.
- O really!

1553
02:00:34,606 --> 02:00:36,005
That's what irritates me too.

1554
02:00:36,107 --> 02:00:39,372
So till l kill both of
you l can't live in peace.

1555
02:00:39,477 --> 02:00:41,741
You thought by getting me trapped. .

1556
02:00:41,846 --> 02:00:44,508
. . you could enthrone your brother?
- Hey!

1557
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:48,014
Stop your atrocities at least now.

1558
02:00:48,853 --> 02:00:51,321
Let my husband live
at least for my kids.

1559
02:00:51,422 --> 02:00:53,447
''Chinna, please. No. ''

1560
02:00:56,528 --> 02:00:58,496
Your character doesn't change
even if you kill one person. .

1561
02:00:58,596 --> 02:01:01,497
. . and even if kill hundred persons.

1562
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:07,397
This is my character for this birth.

1563
02:01:11,142 --> 02:01:13,406
Human history became
with fight between brothers.

1564
02:01:14,379 --> 02:01:17,507
''For centuries weapons have changed,
but the wars didn't. ''

1565
02:01:20,652 --> 02:01:21,710
Chinna.

1566
02:01:27,525 --> 02:01:29,493
He is not my brother. Get lost.

1567
02:01:35,133 --> 02:01:36,760
lt can't happen.

1568
02:01:45,476 --> 02:01:46,534
''Hey, look at them. ''

1569
02:02:04,963 --> 02:02:06,794
No!
- Uncle.

1570
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:36,675
There will definitely
be recounting this time.

1571
02:02:36,812 --> 02:02:38,609
They are not
letting our agent inside.

1572
02:02:39,714 --> 02:02:40,976
You must talk to the collector once.

1573
02:02:41,783 --> 02:02:43,717
Where is Mitra?
- l am calling him since long. .

1574
02:02:43,852 --> 02:02:45,786
. . but not getting through.
- All of you look like. .

1575
02:02:45,921 --> 02:02:47,912
. . you are busy with vote-counting.

1576
02:02:51,793 --> 02:02:53,658
''l don't think there is enough
time to know the result, father. ''

1577
02:03:03,405 --> 02:03:04,872
''Mitra was attacked, sir. ''

1578
02:03:05,006 --> 02:03:07,702
''We don't know who they are,
but Mitra escaped. ''

1579
02:03:08,376 --> 02:03:09,843
Where did it happen?
- ln Alankar theatre.

1580
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:15,816
Among 500 people l designed
it with twelve 9 mm bullets.

1581
02:03:17,352 --> 02:03:19,286
l don't think your dear
son will die before giving. .

1582
02:03:19,421 --> 02:03:21,389
''. . fire to your pyre, father. ''

1583
02:03:22,791 --> 02:03:23,815
He escaped death.

1584
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:32,760
''Why are you shivering
in that way, father?''

1585
02:03:34,035 --> 02:03:35,263
l didn't even tell you
about your daughter's. .

1586
02:03:35,403 --> 02:03:36,734
. . and son-in-law's death yet.

1587
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:40,570
''You are wondering if l am
really your son or not, right?''

1588
02:03:40,709 --> 02:03:43,837
Look at me. Look at the
traitor you brought up.

1589
02:03:44,713 --> 02:03:47,739
Look at the ruthlessness of
your son whom you ignored.

1590
02:03:48,717 --> 02:03:50,685
You left your son and
supported an outsider.

1591
02:03:50,819 --> 02:03:52,377
Look what is left for you now.

1592
02:03:58,393 --> 02:03:59,417
ldiot.

1593
02:04:00,695 --> 02:04:06,031
''Hey, what do you know about
your father? ldiot. ldiot. ''

1594
02:04:06,368 --> 02:04:08,302
''Look at the properties,
FDs and dollar accounts. . ''

1595
02:04:08,436 --> 02:04:09,460
. . that l saved for you.

1596
02:04:09,738 --> 02:04:12,639
God defeated me by
sending you into my life.

1597
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:17,607
Because of you l mortgaged my

1598
02:04:23,652 --> 02:04:27,088
What would you achieve
by killing your kin?

1599
02:04:28,623 --> 02:04:31,820
l sent men to kill
my loyal Basha. Why?

1600
02:04:31,993 --> 02:04:35,019
For you. For you. O God!

1601
02:04:46,474 --> 02:04:48,999
What will you achieve
by joining politics?

1602
02:04:50,478 --> 02:04:53,675
You don't need that life filled
with bloodshed and conspiracies.

1603
02:04:54,883 --> 02:04:57,374
Let him live with that muck.

1604
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:07,017
Enjoy my immense wealth.
Live happily. Live happily.

1605
02:05:09,631 --> 02:05:11,861
l will have to save you
from him at any cost now.

1606
02:05:48,803 --> 02:05:52,102
''Hey! - Mitra. Mitra,
stop. - Father, leave me. ''

1607
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:54,504
''Mitra, listen to me. Stop.
- Father, leave me. - Mitra. ''

1608
02:05:58,880 --> 02:05:59,904
Hey!

1609
02:06:09,224 --> 02:06:10,452
Get into the van.

1610
02:06:10,859 --> 02:06:11,883
Leave me.

1611
02:06:13,128 --> 02:06:14,152
Hey!

1612
02:06:36,885 --> 02:06:41,788
l killed many a toughies
in my 20 years of service.

1613
02:06:41,923 --> 02:06:44,721
What chance do you have?
- Gowda.

1614
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,700
Don't forget that he is also my son.

1615
02:06:55,537 --> 02:06:56,561
He is like my son.

1616
02:07:06,981 --> 02:07:08,642
My heart is shattering into pieces. .

1617
02:07:08,783 --> 02:07:10,546
. . for whatever injustice happened.

1618
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:14,987
But we have to stop
this bloodshed here.

1619
02:07:17,058 --> 02:07:21,119
''lf we stop it here
dharma won't survive, father. ''

1620
02:07:30,772 --> 02:07:31,796
Then listen. .

1621
02:07:34,075 --> 02:07:38,842
However he is it's my dharma
as a father to save my son.

1622
02:07:45,653 --> 02:07:52,286
''l have no father
other than you, father. ''

1623
02:08:08,810 --> 02:08:15,238
lf you want to save your
son kill me right here.

1624
02:08:49,851 --> 02:08:51,842
ln Andhra Pradesh's
state assembly elections. .

1625
02:08:51,986 --> 02:08:54,955
. . Gannavaram's constituency's
verdict has been passed. .

1626
02:08:55,089 --> 02:08:57,284
. . after recounting the votes twice.

1627
02:08:57,425 --> 02:09:00,121
The present MLA
Lokanatham defeated his. .

1628
02:09:00,261 --> 02:09:03,230
. . nearest opponent Partha
Sarathi by just 32 votes.

1629
02:09:07,335 --> 02:09:08,927
lt's a fraud. lt's a fraud.

1630
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:11,197
lt's a bigger fraud than
George Bush's election in America.

1631
02:09:11,339 --> 02:09:13,967
They announced different
verdicts after each counting.

1632
02:09:14,175 --> 02:09:15,836
Finally as his
party came into power. .

1633
02:09:15,977 --> 02:09:20,107
. . he made this counting final.
This is injustice. lt's unfair.

1634
02:09:20,248 --> 02:09:23,342
They paid money and
influenced the counting.

1635
02:09:23,685 --> 02:09:25,152
lt's unfair. lt's injustice.

1636
02:09:25,286 --> 02:09:27,811

But revenge will keep
chasing him wherever we hide him.

To be on the safe side we
should take the first step.

Your death will reduce
the burden on earth. Hey!

''Did Basha kill him?
- lt's not Basha, sir. ''

1744
02:20:49,570 --> 02:20:52,903
Look what your son did to my son.

But in the end l
couldn't live for my son.

1750

Whom shall l live for now?

1757
02:22:07,781 --> 02:22:12,081

''This wound will never heal. ''

''lt has made me immune
to all other pains. ''

'Only till my son is
alive l am a father. '

l am an animal.

1769
02:23:27,961 --> 02:23:30,452
All these days we lived
for leaders and got fooled.

1770
02:23:30,631 --> 02:23:34,158
We need a leader who
would live for us.

1771
02:23:35,769 --> 02:23:38,966
We need a leader who has
ethics and compassion.

1772

''Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir,
stop. Please don't go inside. ''

''We are not new guests.
- Sir is not well, sir. ''

1774
02:24:57,262 --> 02:24:59,696
He didn't even drink
water since a week. - So?

1775
02:24:59,798 --> 02:25:01,163
You think we will let him die?

1776
02:25:01,266 --> 02:25:04,394
''We have invested a lot of him.
Move aside. - Your wish, sir. ''

1777
02:25:04,502 --> 02:25:07,130
You are going inside. l don't
know if you will come outside.

1778
02:25:10,642 --> 02:25:13,702
''Hey, my eyes are burning.
Close the doors. ''

1779

. . take the oath as the minister.

1781
02:25:28,293 --> 02:25:30,853
How can you sit here
in such a dull manner?

1782
02:25:31,329 --> 02:25:33,559
Will you also die along
with the one who died?

1783
02:25:33,932 --> 02:25:35,832
Listen. Drink water.

1784
02:25:36,501 --> 02:25:39,561
lf you keep mourning
here all day long. .

1785

son is snatching your men. .

1786
02:25:42,774 --> 02:25:45,470
. . and is becoming their leader.

1787
02:25:46,211 --> 02:25:49,908
Till you stand him
he can't be crushed.

1788
02:25:50,682 --> 02:25:55,278
Now it's up to you if you kill him. .

1789
02:25:55,386 --> 02:25:59,618
. . or give him the
reigns of power. That's all.

1790
02:25:59,724 --> 02:26:02,522
Stop it! Stop your
rubbish and sit outside.

1791
02:26:02,627 --> 02:26:05,619
That's not the thing. . - You
will be called when needed. Go.

1792
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:16,766
''Gowda, you stay there. ''

1793
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:37,585
''Don't mind what Mr. Reddy said, sir. ''

1794
02:26:37,695 --> 02:26:40,425
lt was a different
matter when Chinna was alive.

1795
02:26:40,732 --> 02:26:42,222
You are already mourning your son.

1796
02:26:42,333 --> 02:26:44,301
At this time you
need to think calmly. .

1797
02:26:44,402 --> 02:26:46,563
. . instead of getting aggressive.

1798
02:26:49,974 --> 02:26:51,305
You worthless fellow!

1799
02:26:52,310 --> 02:26:54,642
Only because you couldn't
finish the job l gave you on time. .

1800
02:26:54,746 --> 02:26:56,714
. . that my life has become like this.

1801
02:26:56,815 --> 02:26:59,807
What is left with
me to think calmly?

1802
02:26:59,918 --> 02:27:03,945
What is left with me?
What is left with me?

1803
02:27:05,757 --> 02:27:10,558
''You got angry?
- lt's alright, sir. ''

1804
02:27:11,763 --> 02:27:14,493
You are chasing me since
four years for promotion.

1805
02:27:14,599 --> 02:27:16,897
You would bear anything.
You would do anything.

1806
02:27:29,414 --> 02:27:31,780
''That amount is for you.
- l got it, sir. ''

1807
02:27:32,317 --> 02:27:35,445
''That amount is for you.

1808
02:27:35,553 --> 02:27:38,681
''That amount is for you.
- l got it, sir!''

1809
02:27:39,958 --> 02:27:44,895
What did you get? - That l
have to bring another dead body.

1810
02:27:45,763 --> 02:27:49,426
Till then have some
food and stay alive.

1811
02:27:49,534 --> 02:27:51,297
Two dead bodies.

1812
02:28:00,778 --> 02:28:01,836
Basha too.

1813
02:28:02,513 --> 02:28:05,573
lf l don't get
promotion in two months. .

1814
02:28:05,683 --> 02:28:08,675
. . you will be the third dead body.

1815
02:28:14,025 --> 02:28:17,483
ln a day or two there is
the granite sites' hearing.

1816
02:28:17,862 --> 02:28:20,660
''Kill that Durga as well,
while you are at it. ''

1817
02:28:21,332 --> 02:28:23,960
There will be no
villains left for this term.

1818
02:28:24,068 --> 02:28:25,433
lf dust settles down
there is a danger. .

son would join hands.

lt's you.

1823

uncle's clothes? - So what?

1825
02:30:41,072 --> 02:30:43,836
''They will get married.
- Get lost, idiot. ''

1826
02:30:44,876 --> 02:30:46,844
''Hey, what rubbish are you talking?''

1827
02:30:46,978 --> 02:30:48,639
Will you marry uncle?

1828
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:52,040
''Hey, if you don't stop talking
rubbish l will spank you both. ''

1829
02:30:52,116 --> 02:30:53,879
Come and remove the
clothes both of you.

1830
02:30:54,619 --> 02:30:57,679
We understood it with your
style of arranging clothes.

1831
02:30:58,089 --> 02:31:00,785
Shut your mouth and go. Go
and ask your uncle about it.

1832

Get lost.

1833
02:31:02,093 --> 02:31:03,651

1876
02:36:20,978 --> 02:36:23,776
Flash news. The stay order
passed by Supreme court. .

1877

Manikota granite lands. .

And in a separate incident. .

1879

. . the granite land
victims' representative. .

1880
02:36:32,156 --> 02:36:34,124
. . Durga Prasad has died.
Basi Reddy denied. .

1881
02:36:34,225 --> 02:36:37,217
. . his involvement in this incident.

1882
02:36:37,795 --> 02:36:40,229
So that's all for now. Goodnight.

1883
02:36:59,316 --> 02:37:00,442
O God!

1884
02:37:02,052 --> 02:37:08,514
They ruthlessly killed him
right in front of my child.

1885
02:37:11,295 --> 02:37:15,789
He worked tirelessly all his
life like a dog for those leaders.

1886
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,936
And now he abandoned us in this way.

1887
02:37:20,871 --> 02:37:22,532
The whole of Bejawada
must be turned upside down.

1888
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:25,104
lf we stay quiet they
will think we are cowards.

1889
02:37:25,309 --> 02:37:27,334
Basi Reddy must be
killed by morning.

1890
02:37:27,845 --> 02:37:30,439
He thinks only he can kill people.

1891
02:37:44,595 --> 02:37:46,495
''Look, she finished her
homework like a good girl. ''

1892
02:37:46,597 --> 02:37:48,155
What have you been
doing since morning?

1893
02:38:00,010 --> 02:38:01,602
This is the public
proposal on granite lands.

1894
02:38:03,247 --> 02:38:04,908
He is Durga's son. Now it's up
to you if tomorrow morning. .

1895

. . he holds a book
and goes to school. .

. . or holds a knife and
goes for Basi Reddy.

1897
02:38:10,387 --> 02:38:12,150
You too know that in this scam

. . they are some
influential politicians as well.

1899
02:38:14,325 --> 02:38:15,451
But today nothing is more powerful. .

1900
02:38:15,559 --> 02:38:17,220
. . than the fire of
revenge in their eyes.

1901
02:38:18,162 --> 02:38:23,361
''Collector, l am giving you 24
hours' time to stop this wave. ''

1902
02:38:25,135 --> 02:38:28,593
After that l will also hold
a knife and be one of them.

1903
02:38:32,309 --> 02:38:36,211
She is not a small girl.
She is a goon. - ldiot.

1904
02:38:41,352 --> 02:38:44,082
Someone's there. Someone's there.

1905
02:38:44,922 --> 02:38:46,480
Someone's there.
- Come inside. - Someone's there.

1906
02:38:47,057 --> 02:38:48,615
Who's there? Who's that?

1907
02:38:50,027 --> 02:38:53,463
''Hey! - Salaba, you go that side.
l will search here. ''

1908
02:38:54,131 --> 02:38:55,189
Who's there?

1909
02:39:06,110 --> 02:39:09,443
l have got nothing to
do with this. l swear.

1910
02:39:09,547 --> 02:39:12,345
What happened?
- l think there's some outsider.

1911
02:39:12,449 --> 02:39:15,043
Thrash him. - He doesn't
belong to this province.

1912
02:39:15,152 --> 02:39:18,383
''Buddy. Buddy.
- Hey, stop it!''

1913
02:39:19,056 --> 02:39:21,024
What's with you? Why did you
come at this time like a thief?

1914
02:39:21,125 --> 02:39:23,093
''l failed lAS exams, buddy.
- So earlier you thought. . ''

1915
02:39:23,193 --> 02:39:24,387
. . you would pass the exam?

1916
02:39:24,495 --> 02:39:26,190
Take him inside. .

1917
02:39:26,297 --> 02:39:28,094
''. . and give him a hot bath.
- Hey, leave me. ''

1918
02:40:17,481 --> 02:40:18,539
Basha.

1919
02:40:21,652 --> 02:40:22,710
Basha.

1920
02:40:25,656 --> 02:40:26,714
Basha.

1921
02:40:30,527 --> 02:40:31,585
''Basha, stop. ''

1922
02:40:38,602 --> 02:40:41,093
Hello!
- Target has missed.

1923
02:40:41,205 --> 02:40:43,605
Some Basha came to his rescue.

1924
02:40:46,543 --> 02:40:50,035
Basha ruined our lives.

1925
02:40:53,217 --> 02:40:56,380
l will go home and
send people to him.

1926
02:40:56,487 --> 02:41:00,082
You must stay inside
home and lock the doors. .

1927
02:41:00,190 --> 02:41:03,250
. . and be a bit careful.
- There's no need for that.

1928
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:04,418
''You go and sleep, Reddy. ''

1929
02:41:05,362 --> 02:41:09,298
My hunting is not for revenge.
Not even for life.

1930
02:41:10,668 --> 02:41:12,192
lt is to stop a truth.

1931
02:41:13,070 --> 02:41:15,504
lt's common to miss the target.

1932
02:41:15,706 --> 02:41:17,401
lf not today we
will get him tomorrow.

1933
02:41:17,508 --> 02:41:21,501
''There are no targets left, Reddy.
You go and sleep. ''

1934
02:41:48,772 --> 02:41:49,830
''Basha, stop. ''

1935
02:41:52,576 --> 02:41:54,407
We can't stop all accident in life.

1936

''l can't see you roaming
like a mad man, Basha. ''

''Keshava, we will reach
the hospital. Hang on. ''

02:45:04,635 --> 02:45:05,761
l stay here with you.

1963
02:45:06,603 --> 02:45:08,264
Your loyalty lies with your master.

1964
02:45:08,839 --> 02:45:10,329
My loyalty lies with my master.

1965
02:45:27,557 --> 02:45:28,615
''Start the van, Basha. ''

1966
02:45:29,059 --> 02:45:33,291
Talking about this
crime is more painful. .

1967
02:45:33,397 --> 02:45:36,389
. . than hiding this truth.

1968
02:45:38,335 --> 02:45:42,897
l couldn't carry this burden
anymore and so l told you.

1969
02:45:43,507 --> 02:45:47,876
''Basha. - l can't carry
this burden anymore, sir. ''

1970
02:45:48,679 --> 02:45:49,737
l can't.

1971
02:45:51,949 --> 02:45:53,007
l. .

1972
02:46:30,368 --> 02:46:31,392
Kill me.

1973
02:46:33,404 --> 02:46:35,838
Still l am in the
shock of the truth.

1974
02:46:37,542 --> 02:46:41,000
Before the truth sinks in kill me.

1975
02:46:43,414 --> 02:46:46,178
You are leaving me because
truth is more painful than death?

1976
02:46:57,128 --> 02:46:58,152
Twenty Five years. .

1977
02:47:00,431 --> 02:47:01,898
For 25 years you
have hidden your sin. .

1978
02:47:02,033 --> 02:47:04,160
. . in the home
where you committed it.

1979
02:47:09,207 --> 02:47:11,198
Even if we search all
the epics we won't find. .

1980
02:47:11,342 --> 02:47:13,936
. . a more sinister
character than you.

1981
02:47:17,114 --> 02:47:19,139
No punishment can equate your crime.

1982
02:47:20,585 --> 02:47:23,053
Look at those glorious epics once.

1983
02:47:25,189 --> 02:47:28,989
Except those who would do
anything to meet their motives. .

1984
02:47:29,126 --> 02:47:33,119
. . there are no heroes or
villains in these stories.

1985
02:47:34,398 --> 02:47:37,333
There is only one
deep-rooted dharma in everyone. Ego.

1986
02:47:39,737 --> 02:47:42,467
The only truth that
moves this world is Hunger.

1987
02:47:44,141 --> 02:47:47,599
Only one entity
dominates every soul. Greed.

1988
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:51,943
When greed dominates
your mind stops working.

1989
02:47:53,284 --> 02:47:57,584
Truth and integrity
become weak in front of it.

1990
02:47:59,423 --> 02:48:02,654
''That day, that moment. . ''

1991
02:48:05,062 --> 02:48:08,498
. . for a mistake l committed
overpowered by these feelings. .

1992
02:48:08,633 --> 02:48:12,399
. . l have been paying
for it all my life.

1993
02:48:14,105 --> 02:48:19,304
''As a father, as a
husband l am paying for it. ''

1994
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:23,440
lf it was a preplanned crime. .

1995
02:48:23,581 --> 02:48:26,277
. . l would've killed and
buried the truth that day itself.

1996
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:38,686
To cross this
juncture in my journey. .

1997
02:48:39,030 --> 02:48:41,624
. . both of you will have to die.

1998
02:48:42,700 --> 02:48:46,136
All the signs that would
remind me of my past. .

1999
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:47,703
. . should be destroyed.

2000
02:48:48,272 --> 02:48:49,296
Basha.

2001
02:48:53,210 --> 02:48:55,110
You will kill me? Kill me.

2002
02:48:57,081 --> 02:49:00,175
Take your revenge. Kill me.

2003
02:49:02,586 --> 02:49:05,282
l can't live in your light.

2004
02:49:07,758 --> 02:49:09,123
You turned me into darkness.

2005
02:49:11,228 --> 02:49:13,219
You have come to see this truth?

2006
02:49:14,398 --> 02:49:16,628
Look at me. Look at me.

2007
02:49:16,767 --> 02:49:19,031
Look at me and
swallow this darkness.

2008
02:49:19,337 --> 02:49:22,534
''Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
- l didn't come to kill you, father. ''

2009
02:49:29,680 --> 02:49:32,046
There's so much love
to sacrifice my life. .

2010
02:49:32,850 --> 02:49:35,341
''. . but still l don't get
enough anger to kill you, father. ''

2011
02:49:38,122 --> 02:49:39,282
You are my only truth.

2012
02:49:41,325 --> 02:49:45,557
lf you turn into a lie l
won't be able to bear it.

2013
02:49:46,597 --> 02:49:48,087
l am unable to bear it.

2014
02:49:49,700 --> 02:49:52,726
lf he was alive l
may not have loved. .

2015
02:49:52,870 --> 02:49:56,033
. . my father as well this much.

2016
02:49:58,175 --> 02:49:59,802
lgnorant about who my father was. .

2017
02:50:01,645 --> 02:50:03,510
''. . l held your finger and
roamed around, father. ''

2018
02:50:05,316 --> 02:50:06,374
But still if the fire of your
anger will be doused with my life. .

2019
02:50:06,517 --> 02:50:07,745
. . you can take it.

2020
02:50:15,659 --> 02:50:16,717
Take it.

2021
02:50:19,397 --> 02:50:21,228
l didn't understand what you said. .

2022
02:50:23,701 --> 02:50:31,403
. . but will you end this
story without dousing your fire?

2023
02:50:32,176 --> 02:50:36,613
Will you hide this
truth from my Goddess?

2024
02:50:48,459 --> 02:50:52,623
''The burning of
fire is an illusion. ''

2025
02:50:53,397 --> 02:50:57,731
''Every emotion in your
heart is an illusion. ''

2026
02:50:58,469 --> 02:51:02,530
''Karma is illusion.
Destiny is illusion. ''

2027
02:51:03,407 --> 02:51:10,677
''The biggest
illusion of all is life. ''

2028
02:52:25,556 --> 02:52:27,217
'Like darkness and light. . '

2029

'. . battle between good and
evil always go on inside us. '

2030

'That never ending
journey is this human journey. '

2031
02:52:37,535 --> 02:52:39,526
'What one sows is what one reaps. '

2032
02:52:41,272 --> 02:52:45,333
''Journey! Journey!''

2033
02:52:45,476 --> 02:52:49,242
''Let's march
towards our destination. ''

than heaven, brother. ''
