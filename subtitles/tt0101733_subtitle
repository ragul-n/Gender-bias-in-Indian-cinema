1
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,639
And I'm in trouble.

2
01:22:23,648 --> 01:22:24,979
The rascal has a pistol!

3
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,974
God knows what other
trouble you'll drag me into!

4
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,397
Quiet...

5
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,408
Go away...

6
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,480
Go...

7
01:23:07,959 --> 01:23:11,622
- Finding them is tough.
- Let's go back. - Yes.

8
01:23:17,969 --> 01:23:19,960
''See, there was no need to scream.''

9
01:23:25,977 --> 01:23:27,444
What...?

10
01:23:34,986 --> 01:23:36,476
Where is it?

11
01:23:36,988 --> 01:23:38,478
Scared of a cockroach!

12
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:44,393
Now...?

13
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,663
''I'll hold this cap up
and move it, they'll shoot''

14
01:23:53,004 --> 01:23:55,996
- And I'll die.
- Why? Don't die.

15
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:59,002
''I'll pretend. Then you stand
and scream, he's dead! ''

16
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:02,946
''The moment they come close to
catch you, I'll grab their gun.''

17
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:07,941
Let me know when they
are about 20 feet away.

18
01:24:27,705 --> 01:24:29,639
He's dead!

19
01:24:30,975 --> 01:24:32,374
Is that right? Dead!

20
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:38,972
He's dead! Very good Stay dead.

21
01:24:43,988 --> 01:24:46,388
40 feet.

22
01:24:48,993 --> 01:24:51,257
30 feet. Get ready.

23
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:56,992
''20 feet. Raghu, are you listening? ''

24
01:24:57,501 --> 01:25:00,436
10 feet! Get up.

25
01:25:03,941 --> 01:25:05,408
Get up!!

26
01:25:08,946 --> 01:25:10,937
''Raghu, get up! ''

27
01:25:16,954 --> 01:25:19,946
''- Enough, get up.
- Catch her.''

28
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:23,950
Don't touch me!

29
01:25:27,632 --> 01:25:29,623
- Get up!
- He's dead.

30
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:36,963
Coward! Scaredy cat!

31
01:25:41,979 --> 01:25:43,640
Hot air balloon!

32
01:27:02,493 --> 01:27:04,484
Excuse me...

33
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:12,162
you...? All alone over here?

34
01:27:13,504 --> 01:27:16,166
I left her with the aunt.
She was to have a baby.

35
01:27:16,507 --> 01:27:18,907
- What did you have?
- A girl - Great.

36
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:21,501
- Congratulations
- Congratulations

37
01:27:22,513 --> 01:27:25,505
- Have you seen her?
- Just now.

38
01:27:26,517 --> 01:27:28,508
- Some thugs carried her away.
- Thugs?

39
01:27:29,186 --> 01:27:30,517
I'll show you.

40
01:27:35,526 --> 01:27:37,517
Advance!

41
01:27:38,529 --> 01:27:40,520
Advance forward not back!

42
01:27:44,535 --> 01:27:47,470
''I said, I won't
call Daddy! Never! ''

43
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:55,877
''Look, don't scream.''

44
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,209
We're not bad characters.

45
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:02,475
You're hurt because you're kidnapped

46
01:28:02,887 --> 01:28:04,878
But we don't touch strange girls.

47
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:07,216
Don't touch girls! My foot!

48
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,950
You are scoundrels!
Rascals! Swindlers!

49
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:16,227
Quiet!

50
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:18,233
Why do you scream so loud?

51
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:27,501
If a rich father loses his child
he has to pay a lakh or two.

52
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:31,242
That is why tell us
your father's phone number!

53
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:35,508
So we're not in trouble.

54
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,014
- Tell us...
- You want the number?

55
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:40,922
Come close. I'll tell you.

56
01:29:14,491 --> 01:29:15,890
Hit!

57
01:29:35,512 --> 01:29:36,911
There...

58
01:30:07,478 --> 01:30:09,207
Hit him some more!

59
01:30:24,995 --> 01:30:26,895
Now where will you escape?

60
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,451
Lower! Down!!

61
01:31:27,491 --> 01:31:29,482
No...

62
01:31:35,499 --> 01:31:36,989
Duffer! No!

63
01:31:48,445 --> 01:31:51,107
Now where will you escape?

64
01:31:51,448 --> 01:31:54,781
- You thrashed us a lot.
- Bravo!

65
01:31:55,119 --> 01:31:56,780
What's in my hand?

66
01:32:00,457 --> 01:32:02,448
I'll blow you to smithereens.

67
01:32:41,498 --> 01:32:43,489
Save me!

68
01:32:51,442 --> 01:32:53,433
''Let go, you egg head! ''

69
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:59,446
- Let's go. - what?
- My cap!

70
01:33:00,451 --> 01:33:03,443
- No! Are you nuts?
- Let go!

71
01:33:37,888 --> 01:33:41,483
My heart is yours

72
01:33:42,493 --> 01:33:44,484
Cupid struck me

73
01:33:47,431 --> 01:33:50,923
My heart is yours

74
01:33:52,436 --> 01:33:55,098
Cupid struck me

75
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,432
''You are my heart, my life''

76
01:34:00,444 --> 01:34:04,437
Only you

77
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:10,181
My heart belongs to you

78
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:12,446
Cupid struck us

79
01:34:15,459 --> 01:34:18,451
''My heart, my breath,
my life, my love''

80
01:34:19,463 --> 01:34:23,456
Only you

81
01:34:53,697 --> 01:34:57,428
''My heart is desirous
since I set eyes on you''

82
01:34:58,435 --> 01:35:01,927
''My heart is desirous
since I set eyes on you''

83
01:35:03,173 --> 01:35:06,836
''You have no idea of
how much I love you''

84
01:35:07,444 --> 01:35:11,437
''You have no idea of
how much I love you''

85
01:35:12,049 --> 01:35:16,042
''I can relate the
story of love to you''

86
01:35:16,853 --> 01:35:19,947
I can tell you what's in my heart

87
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:24,950
I can tell you what's in my heart

88
01:36:16,513 --> 01:36:19,971
''You wouldn't know
what's in my heart''

89
01:36:25,922 --> 01:36:29,517
''I'm not to be blamed
if I fall for you''

90
01:36:34,531 --> 01:36:38,023
''You're a traveller and
I am your destination''

91
01:36:39,536 --> 01:36:43,028
''You are a song and
I am the gathering''

92
01:37:38,528 --> 01:37:40,257
Car... gone!

93
01:37:51,475 --> 01:37:53,875
What fun! How we fooled them!

94
01:37:54,478 --> 01:37:56,878
You're wonderful.
Risked your life for me.

95
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,480
- What if you'd died...?
- If I hadn't risked my life.

96
01:37:59,816 --> 01:38:01,147
You'd have died.

97
01:38:13,497 --> 01:38:15,829
- What's this?
- I don't know.

98
01:38:34,518 --> 01:38:36,986
Have you no shame calling
another's father your Dad?

99
01:38:43,527 --> 01:38:48,965
''Get this clear, you maybe
a big actor on big posters''

100
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,859
Or if stupid girls chase you...

101
01:38:52,469 --> 01:38:55,802
I have always hated you.

102
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:57,132
And I always will hate you.

103
01:38:57,474 --> 01:38:59,465
You've told me this a hundred times.

104
01:38:59,876 --> 01:39:01,468
I'll say it all my life.
Sit down!

105
01:39:03,814 --> 01:39:06,874
I don't give a damn
about what you say.

106
01:39:07,484 --> 01:39:09,952
Pooja loves me and
wants to marry me.

107
01:39:10,487 --> 01:39:12,148
You can't stop us.

108
01:39:12,823 --> 01:39:15,815
''Mr. Actor, these dialogues
won't affect me one bit.''

109
01:39:16,493 --> 01:39:20,896
Pooja has left you.
You've failed to get her back.

110
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,498
I haven't slept a wink
I'm missing my daughter.

111
01:39:25,902 --> 01:39:27,494
Tell me where she is.
I want to see her!

112
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:33,165
I give up. That's
why I've called you here.

113
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,842
2 dozen reporters are
waiting in my office.

114
01:39:36,513 --> 01:39:38,504
Tell them I accept
your marriage to Pooja.

115
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:40,510
Get Pooja from wherever she is!

116
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,511
There he comes.

117
01:39:49,726 --> 01:39:51,887
Mr. Dharamchand wants
to say something to you.

118
01:39:52,796 --> 01:39:55,458
I want to tell you that...

119
01:39:57,467 --> 01:40:00,129
Deepak and I have decided to make up.

120
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,960
Photo.

121
01:40:22,492 --> 01:40:24,756
Look here... the dynamo broke.

122
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,157
It will have to be welded.

123
01:40:30,166 --> 01:40:33,499
- Where will I get the cash?
- You'll pay me later for repairs.

124
01:40:34,504 --> 01:40:38,497
Pay for the welding too.
I'll go get it done.

125
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:42,501
- How long will it take?
- I'll be back soon.

126
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,451
Great number. Turn it loud.

127
01:41:10,473 --> 01:41:13,465
''I'm a traveller on the
path of love, don't stop me''

128
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:20,472
''I'm a traveller on the
path of love, don't stop me''

129
01:41:25,822 --> 01:41:29,485
''I belong to those
who meet me with love''

130
01:41:48,445 --> 01:41:52,438
I accept pain and succor

131
01:41:55,452 --> 01:41:59,445
I accept pain and succor

132
01:41:59,956 --> 01:42:03,448
''I weave every kind
of flower into a garland''

133
01:42:06,463 --> 01:42:10,957
''I weave every kind
of flower into a garland''

134
01:42:33,823 --> 01:42:37,953
''Sunlight was in my fate
that's how I lived my life''

135
01:42:40,497 --> 01:42:44,490
''Sunlight was in my fate
that's how I lived my life''

136
01:42:44,901 --> 01:42:46,493
Madam! Your picture
is in the paper!

137
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:51,106
See what this says. Deepak
and Dharamchand have made up.

138
01:42:51,441 --> 01:42:54,103
''Dear, come back home.
I accept your marriage.''

139
01:42:54,444 --> 01:42:55,843
Look...

140
01:42:57,781 --> 01:43:00,181
I knew you were not ordinary.

141
01:43:01,451 --> 01:43:03,851
''Madam, are you getting married? ''

142
01:43:04,054 --> 01:43:05,453
My wishes.

143
01:43:11,127 --> 01:43:12,458
Hurry up.

144
01:43:27,477 --> 01:43:29,069
- Come on.
- Found a room?

145
01:43:29,479 --> 01:43:32,073
- Agreed with great difficulty.
- Spoke about the money?

146
01:43:32,882 --> 01:43:37,148
I told him we'll stay a week.
We'll see what to say in the morning

147
01:43:37,487 --> 01:43:41,480
- You're great.
- Okay but I don't understand...

148
01:43:41,991 --> 01:43:43,822
Why are you insisting
on staying the night?

149
01:43:44,094 --> 01:43:46,085
''Lf we leave now, we'll
be in Bangalore in 3 hours.''

150
01:43:46,496 --> 01:43:48,430
Till yesterday you were
in a rush to reach Bangalore.

151
01:43:51,835 --> 01:43:55,168
Whom will we meet at 3 AM?
Everyone will be sleeping.

152
01:43:58,441 --> 01:44:00,432
All right. Come on.

153
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:08,110
Gave the room again
without taking advance!

154
01:44:08,718 --> 01:44:11,710
''I told you a hundred
times, don't trust anyone! ''

155
01:44:12,122 --> 01:44:15,455
''The boy is decent,
married owns a car.''

156
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:18,791
Such decent people
cheat and run away!

157
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:29,961
Last stage.

158
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,466
Tomorrow you'll reach home.

159
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,470
Into your husband's arms.

160
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:41,947
And you'll write for the paper.

161
01:44:46,756 --> 01:44:48,155
Strange story.

162
01:45:01,437 --> 01:45:03,166
Will you come to see me?

163
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,431
- No.
- Why?

164
01:45:07,777 --> 01:45:10,439
I don't meet married women.

165
01:45:13,449 --> 01:45:15,440
You can come to ask about me.

166
01:45:16,452 --> 01:45:17,942
No way.

167
01:45:19,455 --> 01:45:23,448
Does this mean we'll
never meet again?

168
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:27,190
What's the need to meet me?
Your job has been done!

169
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:30,198
You had to reach
Deepak and you did!

170
01:45:31,467 --> 01:45:34,459
That's all you wanted
from me! Talks nonsense!

171
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:36,463
What is wrong with you?

172
01:46:18,514 --> 01:46:23,508
I am afflicted by love

173
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:28,857
I am afflicted by love

174
01:46:31,527 --> 01:46:34,519
There's no hope for me

175
01:46:48,478 --> 01:46:52,881
People have started telling me

176
01:46:54,484 --> 01:46:58,477
People have started telling me

177
01:47:00,823 --> 01:47:04,224
There's no way I'll survive

178
01:47:54,811 --> 01:47:59,475
''Love burnt everything
and made me forget all''

179
01:48:00,817 --> 01:48:05,481
''Look at the state
love has reduced me to''

180
01:48:06,823 --> 01:48:09,155
I have lost myself

181
01:48:10,493 --> 01:48:12,484
A fire engulfs me

182
01:48:13,496 --> 01:48:17,899
''The world seems different
since I fell in love''

183
01:48:18,501 --> 01:48:22,904
My heart is not in control

184
01:48:25,508 --> 01:48:29,501
It doesn't hark my advice

185
01:49:31,908 --> 01:49:36,845
''Love made me;
love destroyed me''

186
01:49:38,014 --> 01:49:42,781
''Love made me, you and
the world come to its' knees''

187
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,511
Die for love

188
01:49:47,457 --> 01:49:49,186
Let's do something drastic

189
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:54,863
''Let's spread the
fragrance of love all around''

190
01:49:55,465 --> 01:49:59,925
''For your love, my love... ''

191
01:50:02,138 --> 01:50:05,733
I have given up the world

192
01:51:15,478 --> 01:51:17,469
It's only now that
I fully realise it.

193
01:51:18,481 --> 01:51:23,145
Don't ever leave me
I can't live without you.

194
01:51:25,154 --> 01:51:26,815
I know what you're thinking.

195
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:29,151
Don't think.

196
01:51:29,492 --> 01:51:31,221
Let's elope!

197
01:51:32,495 --> 01:51:33,894
Everything will be fine.

198
01:51:34,497 --> 01:51:35,987
Everything will be fine.

199
01:51:46,776 --> 01:51:49,438
Don't be mad! Go to sleep!

200
01:51:55,851 --> 01:51:57,443
Go!

201
01:52:57,446 --> 01:53:02,440
Everything you said outside...
do you really...?

202
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:06,452
Will you marry me?

203
01:53:19,935 --> 01:53:22,460
I'm going to Bangalore.
I'll be back by morning.

204
01:53:23,139 --> 01:53:25,869
Have to arrange
money to get married.

205
01:53:28,477 --> 01:53:31,810
I too love you and want to marry you

206
01:53:32,481 --> 01:53:36,144
Wait for me. I'll be back
real soon with the cash.

207
01:53:38,487 --> 01:53:39,886
''Yours, Raghu.''

208
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:00,102
I don't have money.
You may keep my bag.

209
01:54:00,443 --> 01:54:03,435
How will the bag help?
I too have a bag.

210
01:54:03,779 --> 01:54:06,771
- Know the price of fuel?
- Keep the spare wheel too.

211
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:09,782
When I return I'll give
you an extra 50 bucks.

212
01:54:11,454 --> 01:54:12,853
What?

213
01:54:13,456 --> 01:54:15,117
I don't have a cap.

214
01:54:21,197 --> 01:54:23,461
- Now fill her up.
- Right away.

215
01:54:45,488 --> 01:54:48,082
- You!
- Sir.

216
01:54:50,426 --> 01:54:52,917
You! Here!!

217
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:56,421
I don't want to see your face!

218
01:54:57,433 --> 01:54:59,697
- Listen to me...
- Anybody there?

219
01:55:00,436 --> 01:55:03,098
Get him out of here
and take me somewhere!

220
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:05,430
Calm down my dear Sharma.

221
01:55:06,442 --> 01:55:08,433
I'm not dear!

222
01:55:09,445 --> 01:55:11,436
Don't take away my
freedom of speech.

223
01:55:12,448 --> 01:55:15,440
- Speak on.
- I respect you.

224
01:55:17,453 --> 01:55:18,852
This city has many papers.

225
01:55:19,455 --> 01:55:22,447
I come straight here
with any exclusive news.

226
01:55:23,459 --> 01:55:27,452
To you. And now for
this year's greatest scoop...

227
01:55:27,863 --> 01:55:29,455
...is in my hands

228
01:55:30,466 --> 01:55:31,956
Shouldn't I come here to you?

229
01:55:32,735 --> 01:55:37,968
- Look into my eyes.
- Pooja is marrying Deepak.

230
01:55:38,474 --> 01:55:40,465
I know it.

231
01:55:43,145 --> 01:55:47,138
That's where you err
in knowing Raghu's genius.

232
01:55:48,484 --> 01:55:49,883
Meaning?

233
01:55:51,487 --> 01:55:56,481
Meaning if I throw a bombshell
that Pooja isn't marrying Deepak...

234
01:55:57,493 --> 01:56:00,223
Everything is settled
and she isn't marrying...

235
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,491
She's marrying another.

236
01:56:02,898 --> 01:56:05,162
Are you drunk? Yes?

237
01:56:05,501 --> 01:56:10,165
Tell me news that Pooja is
marrying another not Deepak

238
01:56:10,973 --> 01:56:13,168
Is it exciting or not?

239
01:56:13,509 --> 01:56:15,238
''Yes, it is. So...? ''

240
01:56:15,845 --> 01:56:18,507
Give me 10000 and
the news is yours.

241
01:56:20,115 --> 01:56:23,516
''You're a cheat, vagabond.''

242
01:56:24,019 --> 01:56:25,509
I don't trust you.

243
01:56:26,121 --> 01:56:29,522
If this news is false...
I'm dead meat.

244
01:56:29,859 --> 01:56:31,520
Use your brains.

245
01:56:32,127 --> 01:56:35,927
''Lf I give false news,
will I survive in this line? ''

246
01:56:36,532 --> 01:56:37,794
Who will give me a job?

247
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:40,866
''They could sue me,
send me to prison.''

248
01:56:41,537 --> 01:56:43,937
And I'll be the first
to send you to jail.

249
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:46,531
All right. I accept.

250
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,466
Whom is she marrying?

251
01:56:48,878 --> 01:56:51,938
''- Firs the cash.
- First the news, then the cash! ''

252
01:56:52,481 --> 01:56:53,812
Who is she marrying?

253
01:56:56,485 --> 01:56:57,884
Me.

254
01:57:03,492 --> 01:57:05,824
Get the car out.
I'm going home.

255
01:57:06,495 --> 01:57:07,985
It's true...

256
01:57:09,498 --> 01:57:11,489
Climb down from the
editor's seat for a minute.

257
01:57:11,834 --> 01:57:13,495
Look into my eyes.

258
01:57:13,836 --> 01:57:15,167
Am I lying to you?

259
01:57:24,513 --> 01:57:26,504
I met Pooja in a bus.

260
01:57:28,517 --> 01:57:32,248
We were together all the time
I fell in love with her.

261
01:57:34,523 --> 01:57:37,981
I love her
And she loves me.

262
01:57:39,528 --> 01:57:42,258
Right now I'm in a rush.
She must be waiting for me.

263
01:57:42,865 --> 01:57:45,527
She doesn't know I've
come to give you this news.

264
01:57:46,535 --> 01:57:49,470
Every minute is valuable.
And I have not a penny.

265
01:57:50,472 --> 01:57:53,873
''Under these circumstances, how
can I tell her I want to marry her? ''

266
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,472
''Yes, there is a story.''

267
01:58:02,484 --> 01:58:04,145
The story has essence.

268
01:58:05,487 --> 01:58:09,480
''Pooja, the daughter of the city's
richest man Dharamchand leaves... ''

269
01:58:10,492 --> 01:58:12,960
...home in a huff to meet her lover.

270
01:58:13,495 --> 01:58:16,487
En route she meets a
roadside Romeo.

271
01:58:16,899 --> 01:58:19,493
She falls in love with him.

272
01:58:20,502 --> 01:58:23,494
Yes! The story spins!

273
01:58:24,506 --> 01:58:26,497
Where is the story?

274
01:58:37,519 --> 01:58:39,510
Get up! Finally
what I said came true!

275
01:58:39,922 --> 01:58:42,516
The boy ran away in the
car without paying up!

276
01:58:43,525 --> 01:58:45,516
- I didn't know...
- How will you?

277
01:58:46,028 --> 01:58:47,461
- You're always sleeping!
- Funny...

278
01:58:48,464 --> 01:58:51,126
Let's go and see
what's the condition.

279
01:58:51,467 --> 01:58:52,798
Hope he hasn't
taken away the fans.

280
01:59:01,977 --> 01:59:03,467
What...? What's the matter?

281
01:59:03,812 --> 01:59:05,473
Where's the husband you came with?

282
01:59:06,482 --> 01:59:09,474
The one in whose car you came.

283
01:59:10,486 --> 01:59:13,148
''- Must be here...
- Taken the bag, luggage... ''

284
01:59:13,489 --> 01:59:15,218
- There's nothing here.
- What?

285
01:59:15,824 --> 01:59:17,485
Who will pay the rent for the room?

286
01:59:17,826 --> 01:59:21,489
She'll pay! She gets clients
to do business! Why won't she pay?

287
01:59:21,897 --> 01:59:23,888
What nonsense! What are you saying?

288
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,161
Pay the room rent.

289
01:59:27,670 --> 01:59:30,503
- I don't have money.
- Then get out of here!

290
01:59:32,508 --> 01:59:34,499
Get out!

291
01:59:35,511 --> 01:59:37,502
- Out
- But where will I go?

292
01:59:37,913 --> 01:59:39,972
None of our concern.
Go to hell!

293
01:59:40,516 --> 01:59:43,508
Drown yourself in a river
but get out of here!

294
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:47,455
Get out! Did you have to come to
this hotel for soliciting clients?

295
01:59:50,459 --> 01:59:53,451
Don't touch the telephone!
Nor show your face again!

296
01:59:54,463 --> 01:59:57,455
This hotel is for
decent people. Get out!

297
02:00:31,834 --> 02:00:34,997
What's the news?
What's wrong with your voice?

298
02:00:36,505 --> 02:00:39,099
Where are you my dear?
Why are you crying?

299
02:00:39,508 --> 02:00:41,999
Tell me where you are.
I'll come to take you!

300
02:00:44,513 --> 02:00:46,242
Stay there. I'm coming.

301
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:53,046
- You've made my life.
- Don't mention it.

302
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:55,787
Your pen has the power.

303
02:00:56,458 --> 02:00:58,187
What a picture you paint!

304
02:01:00,129 --> 02:01:04,463
You are somewhat greedy
but no writer like you.

305
02:01:12,474 --> 02:01:15,466
Where the heck are you?
No! That story won't be printed.

306
02:01:15,878 --> 02:01:20,247
This one will be. I want
a pretty picture of Pooja.

307
02:01:21,483 --> 02:01:23,974
Where's the cartoon?
Sent the cartoonist here.

308
02:01:24,486 --> 02:01:28,479
I want a cartoon of Deepak
standing near the wedding hall.

309
02:01:28,957 --> 02:01:31,949
And Pooja waves bye to him
and leaves with another.

310
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:34,985
''Good, isn't it? ''

311
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:41,492
Send somebody and compose this.
That story won't be printed.

312
02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:44,495
Just a minute...

313
02:01:45,908 --> 02:01:47,432
Don't disturb me. I'm busy.

314
02:01:49,444 --> 02:01:52,106
- I don't want to hear it.
- Pooja spoke to Dharamchand.

315
02:01:53,448 --> 02:01:55,439
Pooja spoke to Dharamchand.

316
02:01:55,784 --> 02:01:57,183
She's come back home.

317
02:01:57,853 --> 02:01:59,445
What...?

318
02:02:01,456 --> 02:02:04,448
He fleeced me for 10000.

319
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:09,453
I won't spare you!
Call the cops! Arrest him!

320
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:55,171
''You'll be the bride
and I'll be the groom''

321
02:02:56,712 --> 02:03:00,773
''You'll be the bride
and I'll be the groom''

322
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:06,853
''Wait for me, I'll come
for you in a procession''

323
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:46,757
''Drums, music, horses and
elephants will accompany us''

324
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:54,767
''Drums, music, horses and
elephants will accompany us''

325
02:03:55,837 --> 02:04:00,433
I'll envelop you in my arms

326
02:04:02,444 --> 02:04:06,437
When the night of union approaches...

327
02:04:07,783 --> 02:04:11,776
''With talks of
romance on my lips... ''

328
02:04:12,454 --> 02:04:17,448
I'll keep you awake all night

329
02:04:27,469 --> 02:04:31,462
''I'll be the bride
and you'll be my groom''

330
02:04:32,808 --> 02:04:37,472
''I'll be the bride
and you'll be my groom''

331
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:42,473
I will die with love for you

332
02:05:17,452 --> 02:05:23,448
''Since you stepped into
my heart, my life partner... ''

333
02:05:32,467 --> 02:05:37,461
''You've brought the love
of a lifetime with you''

334
02:05:38,874 --> 02:05:43,470
Since I first saw you...

335
02:05:44,479 --> 02:05:48,813
I asked God for you

336
02:05:50,485 --> 02:05:53,977
I can't live without you

337
02:07:05,494 --> 02:07:07,985
''Did you hear, Pooja
went back to her father? ''

338
02:07:08,497 --> 02:07:11,159
Deepak is swinging.
What a crazy girl!

339
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:23,171
Give this money to Sharma.

340
02:07:24,513 --> 02:07:26,845
''And tell him, I was joking.''

341
02:07:27,516 --> 02:07:29,006
There was no such news.

342
02:07:33,188 --> 02:07:34,519
The flush doesn't work.

343
02:07:34,923 --> 02:07:37,915
Everyone cheats me of
my money. Money...?

344
02:07:38,527 --> 02:07:40,927
- Raghu returned it.
- Why?

345
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:43,521
He said that was a lie.

346
02:07:44,533 --> 02:07:46,023
Where is he?

347
02:07:56,878 --> 02:07:59,472
What is this?

348
02:08:01,883 --> 02:08:03,874
Thought I'd pull your leg.

349
02:08:06,488 --> 02:08:08,149
But the story was good?

350
02:08:10,492 --> 02:08:12,892
It happens. This happens in life.

351
02:08:13,495 --> 02:08:15,895
Man plans something but
something else happens.

352
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:22,231
Keep this. Get back when
you're in the mood. We'll talk.

353
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:00,799
I knocked but you...

354
02:09:01,476 --> 02:09:02,966
I was thinking.

355
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:09,814
Everything is arranged.
Your marriage is being talked.

356
02:09:11,486 --> 02:09:15,980
I hear Deepak will come in
a chopper for the wedding.

357
02:09:16,491 --> 02:09:17,890
I too heard that.

358
02:09:19,494 --> 02:09:22,895
It's madness according
to me but it's all right.

359
02:09:23,498 --> 02:09:25,489
He can do what he thinks is right.

360
02:09:37,512 --> 02:09:39,980
''Dear, what's wrong? ''

361
02:09:40,915 --> 02:09:42,906
- What is wrong?
- Nothing.

362
02:09:44,919 --> 02:09:48,446
You seem upset since you came.

363
02:09:49,457 --> 02:09:51,118
I'm worried abut you.

364
02:09:52,794 --> 02:09:55,456
Are the marriage preparations fine?

365
02:09:57,465 --> 02:09:59,126
Have Deepak and you...?

366
02:09:59,801 --> 02:10:05,467
- No. - If there's
something... it's not too late.

367
02:10:05,874 --> 02:10:08,468
Do you know my real
feelings about Deepak?

368
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:13,913
My child...

369
02:10:16,484 --> 02:10:18,475
I want you to be happy.

370
02:10:19,888 --> 02:10:22,880
I want to give you
the world's happiness.

371
02:10:24,492 --> 02:10:25,959
What is the matter?

372
02:10:28,496 --> 02:10:29,895
My baby...

373
02:10:40,508 --> 02:10:43,238
Are you in love with another?

374
02:10:55,457 --> 02:10:57,448
Love! You love somebody else!

375
02:10:57,859 --> 02:10:59,451
Not Deepak? Fantastic!

376
02:11:00,462 --> 02:11:03,124
- Where did you meet him?
- In the bus.

377
02:11:03,865 --> 02:11:06,857
Bus...? Is he a bus conductor?

378
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:11,462
- No.
- Who is he?

379
02:11:12,474 --> 02:11:17,207
I don't know much about him
but I like him.

380
02:11:17,979 --> 02:11:20,470
You like the bus or him?

381
02:11:21,483 --> 02:11:24,475
- Him.
- Then why are you serious?

382
02:11:25,487 --> 02:11:26,977
No use.

383
02:11:27,489 --> 02:11:29,150
He hates me!

384
02:11:30,892 --> 02:11:34,157
- Hates...? - He thinks I'm the
spoilt child of a rich father.

385
02:11:35,497 --> 02:11:37,488
Spoilt child of a rich man?

386
02:11:37,832 --> 02:11:39,163
He thinks something
similar about you too.

387
02:11:40,502 --> 02:11:42,493
He says you're
responsible for spoiling me.

388
02:11:42,837 --> 02:11:44,498
You didn't raise me well.

389
02:11:45,006 --> 02:11:46,496
Where is he?
I want to meet him.

390
02:11:46,841 --> 02:11:48,172
- I want to meet him.
- Don't know.

391
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:52,111
I must meet him. It's urgent!
This wedding has to be stopped.

392
02:11:52,447 --> 02:11:54,438
Stop it. Stop!!

393
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:57,441
- This marriage is wrong.
- Daddy...

394
02:11:58,453 --> 02:12:00,444
Send the groom back!

395
02:12:02,457 --> 02:12:04,448
I want the boy!

396
02:12:13,868 --> 02:12:15,460
I don't want to trouble you more.

397
02:12:16,871 --> 02:12:20,739
The boy was right. I kept
running around without thinking.

398
02:12:21,476 --> 02:12:22,966
What did I want?

399
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:25,469
Now I must stop somewhere.

400
02:12:26,481 --> 02:12:28,073
I must hold somebody's hand.

401
02:12:31,486 --> 02:12:32,976
You've changed.

402
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:36,150
You were a kid when
you bolted from the ship.

403
02:12:37,892 --> 02:12:40,486
But you've returned as a woman.

404
02:12:41,496 --> 02:12:43,487
This boy must have a hand in this.

405
02:12:43,998 --> 02:12:46,831
- The boy! I want the boy!
- You won't find Raghu now.

406
02:12:47,435 --> 02:12:49,426
Who won't be found?

407
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,171
What's his full name?

408
02:13:03,785 --> 02:13:05,116
What is this?

409
02:13:05,453 --> 02:13:07,444
Nothing... no...

410
02:13:15,463 --> 02:13:20,059
''Mr. Dharamchand, I want to
talk to you about money.''

411
02:13:20,468 --> 02:13:22,459
Concerning your daughter.

412
02:13:27,475 --> 02:13:30,205
- Will you see him?
- I'll have to.

413
02:13:30,812 --> 02:13:33,940
He found you so I must reward him.

414
02:13:39,754 --> 02:13:42,746
Do meet him and don't
forget to reward him.

415
02:13:43,491 --> 02:13:45,482
He was good company
during the journey.

416
02:13:46,494 --> 02:13:48,155
And do tip him.

417
02:14:00,108 --> 02:14:01,439
Pooja...!

418
02:14:13,955 --> 02:14:15,946
- Where's Pooja?
- Upstairs.

419
02:14:24,799 --> 02:14:26,198
I've come to take you.

420
02:14:27,468 --> 02:14:30,130
Get dressed. We're
going to a grand party.

421
02:14:31,472 --> 02:14:33,463
''- You'll come, won't you?
- Yes.''

422
02:14:47,422 --> 02:14:49,890
What's wrong with you?
Why are you standing morose?

423
02:14:51,426 --> 02:14:53,826
Every year you're the life
of the party. What's it now?

424
02:14:54,028 --> 02:14:55,427
I'm not in the mood.

425
02:14:56,431 --> 02:14:59,889
''Forget it. At this age,
girls come and go.''

426
02:15:00,435 --> 02:15:02,835
''Lf one girl leaves, will
you mope all your life? ''

427
02:15:06,441 --> 02:15:10,434
Stand near the door and
receive all the guests.

428
02:16:04,999 --> 02:16:08,491
You are the love of one man

429
02:16:09,504 --> 02:16:13,497
But another man loves you

430
02:16:14,842 --> 02:16:17,936
You are the love of one man

431
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:22,516
But another man loves you

432
02:16:23,851 --> 02:16:26,945
One man likes you

433
02:16:28,523 --> 02:16:31,959
One man likes you

434
02:16:32,927 --> 02:16:36,522
But somebody else wants you

435
02:17:05,493 --> 02:17:08,758
''What is ours and
what belongs to others''

436
02:17:09,897 --> 02:17:13,298
What is fact and what is fiction?

437
02:17:14,502 --> 02:17:17,494
''What is ours and
what belongs to others''

438
02:17:19,107 --> 02:17:22,770
What is fact and what is fiction?

439
02:17:23,511 --> 02:17:27,504
Who in the world knows?

440
02:17:28,516 --> 02:17:31,508
Who in the world knows?

441
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:36,515
You are in one man's vision

442
02:17:37,525 --> 02:17:41,518
But another steals glances

443
02:18:38,519 --> 02:18:41,511
This often happens in love

444
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:46,248
''One laughs while
another sheds tears''

445
02:18:47,128 --> 02:18:50,461
This often happens in love

446
02:18:51,866 --> 02:18:55,233
''One laughs while
another sheds tears''

447
02:18:56,470 --> 02:18:59,871
One wins while another loses

448
02:19:00,474 --> 02:19:05,070
One wins while another loses

449
02:19:05,913 --> 02:19:09,474
You are the life of one

450
02:19:10,484 --> 02:19:14,215
''But somebody else
understands you''

451
02:20:10,144 --> 02:20:13,944
I wonder how I can keep mum

452
02:20:14,482 --> 02:20:18,475
''How can I bear the
pain in my heart? ''

453
02:20:19,487 --> 02:20:22,979
I wonder how I can keep mum

454
02:20:23,824 --> 02:20:27,487
''How can I bear the
pain in my heart? ''

455
02:20:28,496 --> 02:20:32,489
''How can I say
I'm facing a dilemma? ''

456
02:20:33,501 --> 02:20:36,834
''How can I say
I'm facing a dilemma? ''

457
02:20:37,905 --> 02:20:41,500
You are my only companion

458
02:20:42,510 --> 02:20:46,503
None other walks beside me

459
02:22:01,455 --> 02:22:02,854
''Yes, this is Raghu Jaitly''

460
02:22:05,459 --> 02:22:06,949
''No, I won't come home.''

461
02:22:08,462 --> 02:22:09,929
I want to meet you in the office.

462
02:22:11,465 --> 02:22:15,128
L; m going to Bombay in 2 days
Then I might go to America.

463
02:22:15,803 --> 02:22:18,795
''Before I leave, I want
to clear your account.''

464
02:22:19,473 --> 02:22:23,807
But I don't want to come
in the midst of the wedding.

465
02:22:24,478 --> 02:22:28,471
That's none of your concern.
Come straight to my personal room.

466
02:22:31,152 --> 02:22:32,483
All right.

467
02:22:33,487 --> 02:22:38,481
I want to see your son-in-law
comes for marriage or a circus.

468
02:22:40,494 --> 02:22:42,485
- I hear he'll come in a chopper
- Yes.

469
02:22:42,830 --> 02:22:46,493
Let's see this spectacle
What's the victory of love?

470
02:22:53,441 --> 02:22:54,908
Who is it?

471
02:22:57,445 --> 02:22:58,776
Yes.

472
02:23:10,458 --> 02:23:11,925
I got your letter.

473
02:23:13,461 --> 02:23:16,453
Pooja told me about you.

474
02:23:18,466 --> 02:23:21,458
She never told me how you
helped her in the journey.

475
02:23:22,470 --> 02:23:25,962
Your daughter is good
at forgetting favours.

476
02:23:28,476 --> 02:23:32,469
Don't mistake me. I meant
she didn't tell me till lately.

477
02:23:33,481 --> 02:23:36,917
''According to her,
you should get your dues.''

478
02:23:38,486 --> 02:23:40,477
Really? Full dues?

479
02:23:41,489 --> 02:23:42,956
That's good news.

480
02:23:44,492 --> 02:23:46,756
How should it be
according to you?

481
02:23:47,428 --> 02:23:53,196
I don't know. Must see what
right you have over the cash.

482
02:23:55,102 --> 02:23:57,434
I wouldn't come here
if I had no right.

483
02:24:00,441 --> 02:24:03,433
''Here, it's the complete account.''

484
02:24:05,446 --> 02:24:07,846
- Is it in English?
- You're holding it upside down.

485
02:24:10,451 --> 02:24:12,112
Sorry once again.

486
02:24:36,477 --> 02:24:40,470
''Hotel rent Rs. 45, iron Rs. 2,
toothpaste 9.30 I mean 9.50.''

487
02:24:40,881 --> 02:24:43,475
''Tooth brush 3.25,
repairing car Rs. 75.''

488
02:24:43,884 --> 02:24:46,751
''1 cap Rs. 35, 1 shirt 45,
2 pants Rs. 235''

489
02:24:47,087 --> 02:24:48,645
''1 bag 135, 1 shirt 135.''

490
02:24:48,822 --> 02:24:50,414
1 girl er... lungi 37.

491
02:24:51,091 --> 02:24:52,422
Total Rs. 699.55.

492
02:24:53,427 --> 02:24:54,917
699.55?

493
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:58,762
I even had to sell
my socks and shaving kit.

494
02:24:59,099 --> 02:25:00,430
I haven't charged for that.

495
02:25:00,834 --> 02:25:03,826
- That's fine but...
- What's it? This is less.

496
02:25:04,438 --> 02:25:06,906
One generally spends
a couple of 1000 on such trips.

497
02:25:07,441 --> 02:25:10,433
Just a minute. First
explain this to me...

498
02:25:10,844 --> 02:25:14,439
You want Rs. 699.55
apart from Rs. 100000?

499
02:25:15,449 --> 02:25:16,848
What lakh?

500
02:25:18,452 --> 02:25:21,444
- The reward.
- I didn't speak of that.

501
02:25:23,057 --> 02:25:26,720
I'm confused. Have you
come for the reward?

502
02:25:26,961 --> 02:25:29,930
I've only come for 699.55

503
02:25:30,464 --> 02:25:32,728
Pay up fast. I'm
getting suffocated here.

504
02:25:34,468 --> 02:25:36,060
You're quite a man.

505
02:25:37,471 --> 02:25:41,965
- We'll discuss it another day.
- Another man would come for a lakh.

506
02:25:42,476 --> 02:25:45,468
It's about principles.
You won't understand it.

507
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:50,883
When somebody makes a fool of me
and I have to pay the price...

508
02:25:51,485 --> 02:25:52,747
I don't accept that.

509
02:25:52,886 --> 02:25:54,478
Fool...?

510
02:25:55,889 --> 02:25:57,481
I was made a good fool.

511
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:02,492
- Will you pay or must I leave?
- Just a minute.

512
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:07,899
Rs. 700

513
02:26:10,504 --> 02:26:12,165
- What's this?
- 45 paise.

514
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:17,977
One moment.

515
02:26:19,246 --> 02:26:20,907
May I ask you one question?

516
02:26:21,515 --> 02:26:23,005
Yes.

517
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:28,010
Do you love my daughter?

518
02:26:32,526 --> 02:26:37,520
Any man who loves your daughter
should get his head examined.

519
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:41,531
That's not the answer.

520
02:26:42,536 --> 02:26:45,027
Your daughter has found
herself a good match.

521
02:26:47,074 --> 02:26:49,474
A strange specimen of today's times.

522
02:26:51,211 --> 02:26:55,477
Your daughter needs a man
who'll thrash her day and night.

523
02:26:57,217 --> 02:26:59,947
''Lf you had any sense, you'd
have done this a lot earlier.''

524
02:27:02,489 --> 02:27:03,979
Do you love my daughter?

525
02:27:05,492 --> 02:27:09,223
No simple man can live
with her and not turn mad.

526
02:27:09,830 --> 02:27:11,491
I want nothing to do with her.

527
02:27:11,832 --> 02:27:13,231
Do you love her?

528
02:27:13,901 --> 02:27:17,496
Yes but I can't be blamed.

529
02:27:19,506 --> 02:27:20,837
I too am crazy.

530
02:27:39,526 --> 02:27:41,517
- Hope you've got the money.
- Right.

531
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:45,930
- Congratulations.
- To you too.

532
02:27:46,533 --> 02:27:47,898
Won't you stay for the wedding?

533
02:27:48,469 --> 02:27:52,269
It will be fun. You probably
would never have seen it.

534
02:27:55,743 --> 02:27:57,870
I don't like watching dramas.

535
02:28:03,484 --> 02:28:05,816
- I spoke to Raghu.
- I don't want to hear a word.

536
02:28:06,487 --> 02:28:10,150
- Listen...
- I don't want to hear a word.

537
02:28:13,494 --> 02:28:14,961
But...

538
02:28:56,470 --> 02:28:58,199
''Come, my dear.''

539
02:29:15,489 --> 02:29:19,823
You're making a big
mistake marrying this man.

540
02:29:24,498 --> 02:29:26,159
Raghu is a good boy.

541
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:29,494
He didn't come for the reward.

542
02:29:30,504 --> 02:29:32,836
He wanted the money he spent on you.

543
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:40,505
Leave this marriage and run away.

544
02:29:41,915 --> 02:29:46,784
I'm probably the first father
to advise his child to elope.

545
02:29:49,456 --> 02:29:52,448
Before Raghu runs
away from your life...

546
02:29:53,193 --> 02:29:55,855
Sit in the car I've
parked behind and go away.

547
02:29:57,130 --> 02:29:59,189
Your father's honour is at stake.

548
02:30:07,474 --> 02:30:11,240
How can you marry such an ass?

549
02:31:26,486 --> 02:31:31,480
My heart won't pay heed

550
02:31:42,502 --> 02:31:48,907
Why am I feeling anxious?

551
02:31:50,177 --> 02:31:53,442
The heart is unaware

552
02:32:02,456 --> 02:32:05,914
- What's wrong?
- How can I marry an ass like you?

553
02:32:07,127 --> 02:32:08,458
What are you doing?

554
02:32:12,466 --> 02:32:15,458
''Run away, dear! ''

555
02:32:24,478 --> 02:32:28,141
''Stop, where are you going?
What is wrong with you? ''

556
02:32:29,483 --> 02:32:31,474
Run away!

557
02:32:39,993 --> 02:32:41,483
What's going on?
Where has Pooja gone?

558
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:45,897
She's always running away
so she ran away again!

559
02:33:01,448 --> 02:33:02,938
I want to go to Bombay.

560
02:33:03,183 --> 02:33:04,844
Will you please help me?

561
02:33:15,796 --> 02:33:20,460
God always gives generously.

562
02:33:26,473 --> 02:33:31,467
I love you

563
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:37,143
That's all I know

564
02:33:41,488 --> 02:33:47,825
I couldn't have lived alone

565
02:33:49,162 --> 02:33:52,427
Had I not found you...

566
02:33:56,770 --> 02:34:02,709
''Distressed eyes,
anxious breath... ''

567
02:34:04,444 --> 02:34:07,436
repeatedly say...

568
02:34:11,451 --> 02:34:15,444
My heart does not understand

569
02:34:18,458 --> 02:34:22,952
My heart knows no reason
