1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
All the world's a stage.

2
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,720
And all the
men and women merely players.

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,440
We all have our
entries and our exits.

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,320
And each man in his
life time plays many parts.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,160
Just like you Dad.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
My life is a single word
taken from the book of your life.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,000
Which now has its own story.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,160
I know...

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,720
You were not the richest, wisest...

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,480
...or the most successful

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,840
but you understood life
in a way none of us did...

12
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Good!

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,120
Here you go.

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
Don't forget your bags!

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
Oh yes!

16
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,640
not this one, the other one.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,000
oh yes off course!

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,200
No not this, the other one!

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,040
That one's mine!
- Where?

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,240
That one in your hand!

21
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,800
where? Oh no!
Here you go!

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,600
Not this one, the other one!
- This one's mine!!

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,480
First you say it's here then you say
its there... where is it?

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,720
In your hands!!

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,480
Here? oh!
here you go!

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
Not this one!!
The other one!!

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
Not again!!

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,920
Can I have some water?
- yes.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm really thirsty, are you?

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,040
Should I open it?
- No!

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,880
Should I open it?
- No! water will spill out!

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
Will it spill out?
- Yes!

33
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,000
Will it spill?
- Yes it will!

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,000
Will it spill?

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,000
Did it?
- It didn't!!

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,320
Wow!
How did you do that?

37
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,000
Alright, you cannot be late tomorrow,
like you were today.

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,880
You must be on time alright?

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
You kids..

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,640
Down!

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,960
Once more!
Please do that again!

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
once more!?
alright.. once more it is...

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
I shall show it you once more.

44
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,320
here we go kids!

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
You're really good at it!

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,760
It's nothing sir...

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,720
How was the cloth floating in the air?

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
Nothing really...I just...

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
Could you show it to us again
please?

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,880
oh no!

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,040
How do you do all this?

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,840
It's nothing really sir...
I used to work in the circus.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,320
You were in the circus?

54
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,680
Yes.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,760
Once a clown,
always a clown...

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,840
Whats your name?

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,080
Charlie...

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
Hey Charlie!!

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,440
Charlie!!

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
Ramsingh!

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,840
Chintu, I think you
should look for another job.

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,040
Why?
What's wrong dad?

63
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,960
You made so many mistakes today.
- Mistakes?

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,680
Ask your mother.
Was he smiling?

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,680
No.

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,840
I did!!

67
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Was his timing correct?

68
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,760
No.

69
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Of course it was!

70
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,000
What his energy up?
- Absolutely not!

71
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
It definitely was there Dad!!

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,240
How much can one teach?

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm thinking of getting
myself a new partner.

74
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,600
Dad, I'll train harder.

75
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
Let it be.

76
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,640
Your mother will gift us
another Chintu in 6 months...

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,480
But he will be the one training him.

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,080
Oh yes!

79
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,920
We are in a fix...

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
Chintu?

81
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,000
Will you train our little Charlie?

82
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,680
(Folk song)

83
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
Come here darlings...

84
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
My baby!
How have you been son?

85
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Uncle...

86
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,720
You have to have dinner
with us tonight.

87
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,280
Mom's cooking
something special...

88
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,960
And why is that?

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
Because Uncle Nabeel is here.

90
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Okay.

91
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,720
Uncle?

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,680
Where does the music come from?

93
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,200
from here? or here?

94
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,720
Son... Music comes from here..

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Magic lies within
the person who plays...

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
not in the violin.

97
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,280
Understood?

98
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm glad you guys are here.
Really!

99
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,960
So what's the plan?

100
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,760
When are
you guys taking over?

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,680
The circus
needs new ideas...

102
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,000
new energy.. understand?

103
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,240
I saw the formats of two, three
international circuses on youtube.

104
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
They were amazing!

105
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,120
AC tents, new acts, superb
performances, excellent!!

106
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,960
Nabeel...!

107
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,760
Coming!

108
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,120
Listen... we've called you
here for a meeting, not to clean up...

109
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,760
Hello... hello!

110
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,120
Settle down
please... settle down.

111
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,000
We appreciate you being here

112
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,000
and thank you for being
a part of Jango Circus.

113
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,000
If Mom has succeeded in making Jango
Circus one of the best in the country

114
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,400
it is only because
of your support.

115
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,960
And she hopes that you
continue to give your support

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
to her children

117
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
so that this circus can live on.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
But that's
not what I want.

119
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
Because sadly...

120
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,000
in today's day... the circus is dying.

121
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,960
Films, DVD's, internet, TV,

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,880
mobile phones have
all replaced the circus.

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,000
The circus audience is dwindling

124
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
but its expenses are not.

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,080
That's why after giving
it a lot of thought. I...

126
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,080
I mean mom and
all of us together

127
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,280
have decided

128
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,680
to shut the circus down.

129
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
Right mom?

130
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,120
I understand that the circus
is more than your bread and butter

131
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,800
I understand it's also your home.

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
But you also need to understand...

133
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,320
...that we're not making any profits.

134
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,280
And our family can no
longer bear these losses.

135
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,040
But in spite of the fact that we are
going through a huge financial loss,

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,680
we understand your rights as well.

137
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
and so we'll be paying you

138
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
3 month's salary in advance.

139
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,240
It's the least we can
do for all your support.

140
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,720
It is important for you
and the future of your children.

141
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,760
I hope you'll understand.

142
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,080
Everybody looks so happy.

143
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,720
After all they're
getting paid for 3 months

144
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,280
without doing any work.

145
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,480
I don't know why Charlie
hasn't taken his money yet.

146
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,000
The fool's still rehearsing.

147
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,080
He knows the circus is shutting down.

148
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Rehearsal to an artist
is like a prayer to a priest.

149
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,200
Destroying the church
won't stop him from praying.

150
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,200
Charlie!
Come, sit down.

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,280
No, no..Masterji..
- Oh come on!

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,720
you know I don't drink...

153
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,920
Recognize him?

154
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,160
Oscar sir...

155
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,040
The circus wouldn't have shut
if he was alive...

156
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,080
Do you remember...

157
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,680
once you threw a fit that
you wanted your own circus?

158
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,440
Your father told you
that this whole circus is yours.

159
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
So for two whole weeks
you sat on my chair

160
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,640
and I had to sit outside... remember?

161
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,400
Mom...

162
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,440
It feels good to watch your
child grow into your shoes.

163
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,960
But sometimes they
even outgrow those shoes.

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,120
This circus gave me everything...

165
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Money, success, Oscar, all of you.

166
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,200
One big family.

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Isn't it?

168
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,440
And now everything's over.

169
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,880
I know how we started this circus.

170
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,600
Your father was my first employee.

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
Actually... he wasn't an
employee...

172
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,200
he was like a friend.

173
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,760
we told him to become a partner.

174
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,080
But he said,

175
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
'I'm an artist.'

176
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,280
'If I do business,
the artist in me will die'.

177
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,000
Never met a man like him ever again.

178
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,000
He was the first man I gave a salary to

179
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,120
and today

180
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,600
I give his son the last salary.

181
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,120
No Masterji!
- Keep it son. Keep it!

182
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,960
Life ahead won't be easy.

183
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,800
The risks taken here are nothing
compared to the ones outside.

184
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,920
They don't have safety nets there.

185
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,040
This was a very small circus...

186
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,840
there is a bigger circus out there.

187
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,640
So what's next?

188
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,960
Will you work here
or go back to the village?

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
My father left everything behind.

190
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,640
How can I go back?

191
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,960
I'll do something here.

192
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,120
I know you will open
your own circus...

193
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
And I really want you to.

194
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,760
You are the son I never had...

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Masterji,

196
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,120
can I ask you something?

197
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,000
What? Tell me...

198
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Can I keep my Charlie costume?

199
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,880
It's not your costume.

200
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,120
It's your skin.

201
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,160
You can't go without it.

202
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,640
Ladies

203
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,480
and Gentlemen!

204
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,200
The circus is coming to
town for your entertainment...

205
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,960
India's circus no. 1

206
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,280
JANGO CIRCUS!

207
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,760
JANGO CIRCUS!

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
JANGO CIRCUS!

209
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,240
1000 bucks a week!

210
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
Even if you just stay two days,

211
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
you pay for the whole week.

212
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,800
That's expensive!

213
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,040
It's actually 1500.

214
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,280
since you've come through reference
I'm asking for 1000.

215
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,960
Anything for 4 or 5 hundred?

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,160
Will this do?

217
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,920
It's in the open

218
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
but I'll take 400.

219
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,880
We can't stay here...
- No... we'll take it.

220
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,480
It's just a matter of few days...

221
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Ok.

222
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,000
How long will you be staying?

223
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,640
A few days...

224
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,480
Advance?

225
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,040
Will 500 do?

226
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,280
I'll give you the rest later.

227
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,040
Name?

228
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Charlie..

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ramsingh..

230
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,800
I was at the circus.
They used to call me Charlie.

231
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,960
Joker!

232
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,840
What are you looking at?

233
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
The bigger circus...

234
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,920
getting ready for it.

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Swindler...Insane

236
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,200
This world,
is a city of tight rope walkers

237
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,600
Swindler...Insane

238
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,320
A game, a glittering funfair

239
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,000
Funfair, the world is a funfair

240
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,000
Unwary, everyone
walks on a tight rope

241
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:31,760
Funfair, world is a funfair

242
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,960
Swindler ... Insane

243
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,480
Swindler ... Insane

244
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,280
This world,
is a city of tight rope walkers

245
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,000
You are just a character,
and the curtains have gone up

246
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,800
Now play joy, play grief

247
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,400
Your body

248
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,840
Is just a beautiful toy

249
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,440
Everything is a game

250
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,040
listen .. listen ...
listen ... listen

251
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,080
From faraway,
someone is pulling strings

252
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,000
Of your heart, of your life

253
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,160
You are here to just entertain nature

254
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,600
From faraway,
someone is pulling strings

255
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,400
Of your heart, of your life

256
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,960
You are here to just entertain nature

257
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,240
swindler

258
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,960
Dumb head ... Insane is this world

259
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,680
Swings from one path to the other

260
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,760
Ramsingh... We're a full house.

261
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,120
There's no place for new acts.

262
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,000
You can see Charlie on TV

263
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
but my acts are exclusively
for this circus...

264
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,480
Sir, I'm sure there's
something you could do...

265
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,000
Would you work as a clown?

266
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,320
Charlie is a clown as well!

267
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,640
No sir, Charlie is not a clown...

268
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
But I can work as a clown,
I've done it before.

269
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,040
Alright then!

270
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
Our head clown...

271
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
He's looking for an assistant.

272
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,720
They are rehearsing inside.

273
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,840
Tell them I sent you.

274
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,280
I'll be there in a minute.

275
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
So you quickly run in
and grab the ball and bang!

276
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
He'll hit you. Perfect!

277
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,080
And after that...

278
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,920
Charlie Sir... you... here?

279
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,000
I mean... How are you?

280
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,840
What brings you...

281
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,320
Sorry sir...
I'm so happy to see you.

282
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,240
Guys... you know who he is?

283
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,160
My mentor...

284
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,640
Charlie sir.

285
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,840
Everything I know...

286
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,440
I've learned from him.

287
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,600
I had run away from home.

288
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
This man took my hand
and held me up.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,640
Taught me all the tricks.

290
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
And comic timing?

291
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,960
He's the one who taught me that.

292
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,800
He turned this man into a clown.

293
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,000
If you ever see his Charlie act,
you'll go crazy!

294
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,480
Everyone says the only
person who can outdo him

295
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,120
is Chaplin himself!!

296
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,240
Once...

297
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,960
I was so scared.

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,840
I refused to go on stage.

299
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,280
The manager was so angry.

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But he said, "I believe in you".

301
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,440
"You can do this."

302
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,320
I was tensed. I wanted to cry.

303
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,920
He said, "Then cry."

304
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
I cried like a baby.

305
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,440
But after that I gave
my best performance.

306
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,680
That's when I realized...

307
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,480
this man can teach you anything.

308
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,320
For me!

309
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,280
Raghunath Uncle sent it for you...

310
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,200
I met him at the circus today.

311
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,320
Really?
- He's a head clown now.

312
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,160
I was so happy to meet him.

313
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,440
He made me proud.

314
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,280
But I didn't tell him that I
was there for a job as his assistant.

315
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I know he'd leave his
position and give it to me.

316
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,240
I know him well enough.

317
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,000
I lied to him,
that I was just passing by.

318
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,200
This was the last circus.

319
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,320
I don't know what will happen.

320
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,280
It will...

321
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,240
It will all be fine.

322
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,480
Right Chintu?

323
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,720
What did you do? Do that again.

324
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,280
You're so tiny.

325
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,720
They couldn't wait to pop you out,
could they?

326
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,840
Once more please...

327
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,920
Come on, once more!
I'm asking you nicely...

328
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,320
Hey shorty... go ahead take it...

329
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,000
Keep it..
keep it... you guys were a blast!

330
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,320
Ya... I've just reached the hotel.

331
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll have a quick shower and call.

332
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,720
What are you doing here alone?

333
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,000
Nothing much...

334
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,720
What's your name?
- Chintu.

335
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,680
Chintu? Nice name.

336
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,320
Want toffees?

337
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,320
Wait I'll get some.

338
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,080
Come in.

339
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,840
Look so many toffees.

340
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,320
It's all yours.

341
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,480
Come take it.

342
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,000
Don't be scared.

343
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Come take it.

344
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
Take the chocolates.

345
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,000
I was just... this...

346
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
...Toffees.

347
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,960
Right chintu?

348
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Son leave.

349
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,200
He is...

350
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,280
...Such a cute kid.

351
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,480
I was offered a tailoring job.

352
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm thinking of taking it up.

353
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
We could use the extra money.

354
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
If I don't then we'll
even run out of what's left.

355
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So now you're going to earn money?

356
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,280
I'm not good enough?

357
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,320
In fact, why don't we
get Chintu a job as well.

358
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,000
Both of you can work
I'll sit and relax.

359
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,760
That's not what I meant...
- I know exactly what you meant...

360
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,040
I can be stupid sometimes...

361
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,680
I didn't realize what I was saying.

362
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,000
Would you do me a favor?

363
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,960
I know things haven't been easy

364
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,960
but right now I need more time.

365
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,720
If the little one wasn't
on the way it would be different.

366
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,440
But I think the right
thing to do now is that...

367
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,680
you take all the money
and go to the village.

368
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,960
Take care of yourself...

369
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,760
Take care of Chintu...

370
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,320
and come back with little Charlie.

371
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,720
I promise...

372
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,160
I'll make things okay by then.

373
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,240
just a matter of few months.

374
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,960
What did you say your name was?

375
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
Ramsingh Charlie...

376
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,920
Charlie!

377
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
Man!

378
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,640
This is what I like about artists.

379
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,000
You guys live your character.

380
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,040
I like artists!

381
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,920
What will I have to do?

382
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,480
One minute...

383
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,960
See this!

384
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,000
Do you understand?

385
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,080
This is Chicket!

386
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,800
Cricket with Chickens.

387
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,320
What's this?

388
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
Costume!

389
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,200
Your costume!

390
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
You wear this...

391
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,200
and play cricket for the kids.

392
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,160
But I won't be seen...

393
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,000
But your talent will be seen...

394
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,080
Talent!

395
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,160
What more can an artist want?

396
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,080
Anyone can do this.

397
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,640
Why do you need an artist?

398
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,840
Body language...!

399
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,240
Body language of a chicken...

400
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,400
only a true artist
like you would understand.

401
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,800
Look...

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,760
You play Charlie?

403
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,000
Similarly you'll play a chicken.

404
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,800
This is just a costume.

405
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
You will breathe life into it...

406
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,080
...with your true talent.

407
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,760
Trust me, you should do this!

408
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,800
I don't think I can.

409
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,720
We'll pay you 15000 for a month.

410
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,920
Working period, 5 days.

411
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,240
The rest is just a training period.

412
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
Trust me... you should do this!

413
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,760
The journey was good.

414
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,680
We're doing fine.

415
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,280
Listen, please don't get mad..

416
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,600
I left some money in your bag.

417
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,720
Take it.

418
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,040
It's good you did that...

419
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,440
because things have gotten worse.

420
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,680
I got a job...

421
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,040
and it pays 15000!

422
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,120
What?

423
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
What did you say?

424
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,720
15000!

425
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Was that for me?

426
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,080
No...

427
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,880
for Chintu...

428
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,240
Okay Chickens!

429
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,960
Time to lay eggs!

430
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,040
The costume you are
wearing is very expensive.

431
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,280
Too costly!

432
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,960
Once you wear the costume
and are out on the field then...

433
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,160
no removing of your head...

434
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,960
and no talking in public!

435
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,720
Because the kids believe
that you are a real chicken.

436
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,680
That you are Jenny the Hen.

437
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,440
If you remove the head
or talk to someone...

438
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,400
and the kids think..

439
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,840
hey that's not a chicken but a man.

440
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,880
then our brand's image will be?

441
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,000
Ruined!

442
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,640
What's your name?

443
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
Ramsingh... And yours?

444
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,080
Shahjehan!

445
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,960
I built the Taj Mahal...

446
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Move!

447
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,200
What the hell are you doing?

448
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,080
You've been wearing
this costume for 15 days

449
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,680
you still can't walk straight!

450
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,400
Look at him...

451
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,960
He's been here two days
and is better than all of you!

452
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
Learn something from him.

453
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Do one thing...
put on the Chicklet costume...

454
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,720
Ramsingh...
from today you're Jenny the hen...

455
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,200
Were you born in a chicken coop?

456
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,920
How'd you pick this up so fast?

457
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
I can't do it..

458
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,600
..in this stupid thing.

459
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,240
How do you do it?

460
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
It's easy.

461
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,960
If you work at it...

462
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,440
you will also pick it up.

463
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,800
I used to work at a circus

464
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,280
so I guess that helped.

465
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,640
Circus?

466
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,680
Are you a clown?

467
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,800
No...

468
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,040
...you're not a clown.

469
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,320
You're lying!

470
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,400
Really?

471
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,680
If you're a clown
then do something...

472
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,240
Woah!

473
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,400
You've set the place on fire!!

474
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,800
It's nothing really...

475
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,040
Brilliant!

476
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
What factory make are you?

477
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,400
Killer moves!

478
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,000
But what are you doing here?

479
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,160
The circus shut down so...

480
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,920
I sent my family to the village.

481
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,760
I'll work hard...

482
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,720
collect money,

483
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,320
I'll call them when things get better.

484
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,800
Where are you staying now?

485
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,120
I'm still looking for a place.

486
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,920
Look no further!

487
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,000
Come.

488
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,120
Hey, uncle!

489
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,960
It's a great place for a single guy.

490
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,440
Twenty bucks a day.

491
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,720
You can pay 200 every ten days.

492
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,000
No tension.

493
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
All the guys that stay
here are my friends...

494
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,960
He's going to stay here alright?

495
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,960
Ok.

496
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,480
Come...

497
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,880
Let's find you a spot...

498
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
They drive their rickshaws
all day and sleep soundly at night.

499
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,280
Okay...

500
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,000
Settle down here.

501
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,400
Okay...

502
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,720
I'll get going...

503
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,680
You don't stay here?

504
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,880
If I stayed here then Mumtaz
will get lonely at the Taj Mahal.

505
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,920
Bye.

506
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,480
Welcome to the Cricket
Match of the Century!!

507
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,000
The Aliens V/S The Chickens!!

508
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
Jenny the hen is on strike!

509
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Their fans are thronging the stands

510
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,440
Can the aliens get them out?

511
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Wow! He has scored a run.

512
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,720
Bro! Bring your hands together!

513
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,040
Oh ho ho ho ... it's a reverse sweep

514
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,200
A hook

515
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,400
Another solid hit

516
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,040
Four

517
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,800
Six

518
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,840
Four

519
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,240
But the spectators are pleading for more!

520
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,920
Chicklet is ready to face again

521
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,080
The alien's delivery is a real pain

522
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,080
And this wicket has been a real gain

523
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,720
This chicken's legs are on the grill

524
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
The alien is quite strong

525
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,000
For the chickens it's all going wrong

526
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,000
But Jenny the hen is still going strong

527
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Repeatedly

528
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,080
Explosive

529
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,480
And once again he has hit... a lofted shot

530
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,480
A swivel ... and a hit

531
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,680
A real solid hit

532
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,000
The crowd adores Jenny the hen!

533
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,120
And that brings us
to the end of the innings

534
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,760
Let's see who comes out
on top in the second innings

535
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,120
The Aliens and the Chickens
are both on top of their game

536
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,160
Let's see... who holds their nerves

537
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,400
And who will fold under pressure

538
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,640
A thunderous applause ... brings
an end to the (drinks) break

539
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,960
The alien has given it a mighty swing

540
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,160
The spectators have
started to dance and sing

541
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,160
One explosive shot after another

542
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,280
Are you paying attention at all?

543
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,120
Hey Jenny, there goes the ball!

544
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,640
The chickens are in
a round table conference.

545
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,920
A spinning delivery by Jenny

546
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
And the alien has been clean bowled

547
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,920
The chickens go cock a doodle doo

548
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,000
The chickens are back in the game

549
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,600
Hey! please get me some water

550
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
The aliens have not given up!

551
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,880
They are swinging at everything!

552
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
The pitch has become a dance floor

553
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
It's bhangra (balle balle) time

554
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,480
I think these aliens are from Punjab! Yo!

555
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,800
This match has become
extremely interesting

556
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,720
We are getting to see
some serious strategies

557
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,040
Will the chickens send
the aliens back to space?

558
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,200
Or will the aliens land
an egg on the chickens face.

559
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,320
Who will cross the finish line?

560
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Time will tell

561
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,320
And the alien takes a swing

562
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,000
But straight back to the chicklet bowler

563
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,960
A magnificent display of fielding

564
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,800
It remains to be seen

565
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,160
Will the aliens lose,
and go back to their barren planet?

566
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,280
Or will stay on and inhabit the earth

567
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,640
Chicklet is ready to fire in the next ball

568
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,960
He's bowled a full toss!

569
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,320
And the alien has taken a mighty swing

570
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,720
The ball's gone straight to Jenny the hen!

571
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,600
Jenny throws back the ball!

572
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,400
Wait a minute

573
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,120
That's not Jenny!

574
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,120
that's Johny!

575
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,880
Ohhhhhh

576
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,680
Johnny Johnny no papa!

577
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Jenny the hen has lost his face!
What a disgrace!

578
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,840
What the hell man!

579
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,960
Have you gone crazy?

580
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,680
You call that an event?

581
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,600
Don't you dare come for your payment.

582
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,040
Sir...

583
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,920
Sir... I was very thirsty...

584
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,320
I called the volunteer
but he didn't even look at me.

585
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,160
Tell me, what else I could have done.

586
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,000
Do one thing...

587
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,440
get out of here.

588
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,480
...before the manager loses it!
You should leave.

589
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,240
I'll leave... but my money?

590
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
Money?

591
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,320
Have you gone mad?

592
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,280
Thanks to your stupidity
we won't be paid in full.

593
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,040
And to top things
we've lost this client.

594
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,640
You should leave before
you get your ass kicked!

595
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,600
I wanted to remind
you about the due date.

596
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,720
Are you there?

597
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,080
Yes, I remember...

598
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,640
I'll send some money soon...

599
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,840
Don't send the money...

600
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,280
Bring it here yourself.

601
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,040
I want you to be the
first person our child sees.

602
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,280
He should play in your arms.

603
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,000
And be like you.

604
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,040
You are my hero...

605
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,920
Hello?

606
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Hello?

607
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,720
I'll come soon...

608
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm trying really hard

609
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,840
but I still don't make enough.

610
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,440
Any way you can help?

611
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,000
Help is my middle name.

612
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,040
I'll do something.

613
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,440
Ramsingh look...

614
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,840
it's Jenny the hen's egg!

615
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,720
Shahjehan,
I have to leave for my village.

616
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,720
So go.
- But there's a problem.

617
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,440
The bus leaves in 15 minutes.

618
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,960
I'll miss it if I drop
the rickshaw at the stand.

619
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
Anything else your majesty?

620
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,120
You'll do it, won't you?
- Okay I will.

621
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,640
You will do it right?

622
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,200
I said I will!

623
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,760
Nobody leaves empty handed
from Shahjehan's court.

624
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,800
Right, drop it please.

625
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,880
Now I'll get going.

626
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Hey...

627
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,120
Put this on my tab.

628
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,680
Ramsingh...

629
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,760
why don't you drop
this rickshaw to the stand?

630
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But I've never pulled
a rickshaw before...

631
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,640
If an animal can pull a cart...
I trust you're smarter than that?

632
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,080
Hey rickshaw! hold on!

633
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,200
Take me to the ghat...

634
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
Sir... I am not a rickshaw puller...

635
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,720
You're pulling a rickshaw and telling
me that you're not a rickshaw puller.

636
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,760
Gimme a break!

637
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,960
But I'm telling you the truth...

638
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Let's go... I'm running late
and I'm not asking for a free ride.

639
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,160
Come on...

640
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,960
Believe me, I'm not a rickshaw puller...

641
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
Come on...

642
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,040
This is good. You can stop here...

643
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,840
Stop here, this will do.

644
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,480
I got you here, but I'm telling
you I'm not a rickshaw puller.

645
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,920
Don't start off with that again.

646
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,720
Here you go. You know something?

647
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,640
I'm no Shah Rukh Khan either...

648
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,640
Charlie!

649
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,400
Hey Charlie!!

650
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,080
Ramsingh!

651
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,680
What are you doing here alone?

652
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,440
A new phone?

653
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,240
Looks like someone's making big money!

654
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,040
It's a good excuse to have a drink.

655
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,440
I don't drink.

656
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,720
Trust me,
it will make you feel better.

657
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,640
Believe me...

658
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,000
I really don't drink.

659
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,000
It's not much. Two lovely-lovely pegs!

660
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,280
But I've never had a drink...

661
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,040
Come on! Be a man!

662
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,280
But I...

663
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,240
Do you trust me?

664
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
Brilliant!

665
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,440
Quick... have some peanuts...

666
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,960
Feeling better yet?

667
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,400
Here... have another...

668
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,960
Wow!

669
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,320
I feel like you've just been baptized!

670
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,240
Rickshaw.

671
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,000
Hey Rickshaw.

672
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,880
Masterji, I'll give you a lift...

673
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,040
Charlie!

674
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,000
How are you Charlie?

675
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
What is all this?

676
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm doing great!

677
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,200
And this... was necessary...
Come on... I'll give you a lift...

678
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,880
No... I don't think
I can sit in your rickshaw.

679
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,760
All those years you took care of us...

680
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,040
This is the least I can do...

681
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,040
Careful...

682
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,000
Come... let's have some tea...

683
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,000
No... I'll get going...

684
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,760
You should stop by sometime...
It's good to see you...

685
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,800
Masterji, you don't have to do that...

686
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,640
Charlie...

687
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,000
If you ever want to follow
your dream again. Let me know.

688
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,640
Which dream?

689
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,440
...Of having your own circus.

690
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,720
I still have some circus equipment
that's of no use to my children.

691
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,120
Maybe you can put it to some use.

692
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,480
Reality can be very
different from your dreams.

693
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,840
I have understood that now.

694
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,160
But thank you!

695
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,680
Sorry.

696
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,800
For the delay in payment.
- That's alright...

697
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,960
What's wrong?
Where's my change?

698
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,680
But it takes fifty
rupees to get here...

699
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,480
You're new here?

700
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,000
Sir it costs fifty to get here...

701
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,720
I come here every day...

702
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
gimme back my money...

703
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,000
I don't have any change...

704
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,720
I'll take it some other time...

705
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,400
Dad.. I'm the only little
Charlie you'll ever have.

706
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,280
Let me speak to mamma...

707
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,000
Night oh night,

708
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,120
go away oh night

709
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:29,080
Night oh night,

710
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:36,280
go away oh night

711
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:49,080
My beloved,
seems like a stranger tonight

712
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,880
He seems asleep ...

713
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,080
He seems afar

714
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:04,480
Twist his ear ...

715
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:10,600
Ask him to talk

716
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,920
Night oh night,

717
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,120
go away oh night

718
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,240
Why do you worry about the rain,
oh fish of the sea

719
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:46,760
Drown, drown, drown,
darling, go on a colour spree

720
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:54,720
Slung on the hook,
stuck in your throat

721
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:05,480
Your dream has just
strayed from its path

722
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,720
Do you like it?

723
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,040
Gouri..

724
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,840
Look at your new house darling...
Do you like it?

725
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,760
why don't you open your
eyes and look at your papa?

726
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,400
I'm so happy to meet you and Chintu.

727
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,120
But your mamma doesn't
seem very happy to see me.

728
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,000
No...it's not that.

729
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,000
I just didn't expect to see you like this.

730
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,280
I'm absolutely fine!

731
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,040
I pull a rickshaw.

732
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,800
My feet are my engine.

733
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,960
The more I run, the more I earn.

734
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,320
I'm my own boss!

735
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,840
Come here...Look at this...

736
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,480
The kitchen has everything you need

737
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,120
and I even signed
Chintu up for school.

738
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,400
Every child comes with its own destiny

739
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,640
and we've been blessed
with this angel.

740
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,200
Right?

741
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,120
Soon your father will turn
1 rickshaw into 2 rickshaws,

742
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,120
2 rickshaws into 3 rickshaws,

743
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,640
3 rickshaws into 4 rickshaws...

744
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,960
There's no stopping us now.

745
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,480
Chintu, where are you going?

746
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,880
Heyyyy, my magician!
How are you?

747
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,680
I'm good.

748
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,400
Uncle, how have you been?
What are you doing here?

749
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,680
I'm playing the violin... as always.

750
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,600
So is this the little one?

751
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,200
Yes...Gouri.

752
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,880
Gouri! Looks just like Charlie.
One minute...

753
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,040
You don't need to do that!

754
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,640
But this is the first
time I'm meeting our angel.

755
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,000
You must come home.

756
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,160
I know Charlie would love it.
We'll all have dinner together...

757
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,440
You just cook and I'll
follow the smell to your house.

758
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,960
You should have asked
me before inviting.

759
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,960
I thought you would be happy.

760
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,320
Off course I am

761
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,640
But aren't we done with the circus?

762
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,160
Everyone has moved on with their lives.

763
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,840
Why are you bringing it up again?

764
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,040
Enjoy the dinner now
that you've invited him.

765
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,960
If I make it, great!

766
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,720
...or my sincere apologies...

767
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,800
It broke while changing houses.

768
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,320
After all that time
living in circus tents...

769
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,280
...it must feel good to
have four walls surround you...

770
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,600
But sometimes in moving on,

771
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,680
we forget the things
we cherish the most...

772
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,800
Dinner is ready. Let's eat...

773
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,480
Yes.

774
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,120
Charlie may take longer to return...

775
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,600
You're singing it all wrong!

776
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,280
Hello!

777
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,120
Take him inside...

778
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,240
Careful!

779
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,800
Please don't be angry...
We've overdone it tonight.

780
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,920
I know he doesn't drink but...
We were miserable, out of fear we drank.

781
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,080
Had a little joy left,
stirred it in and we drank.

782
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,080
Weren't born with
a bottle in our hands...

783
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,800
Saw the lonely bottle,
felt bad and we drank.

784
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,000
Wow!!

785
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,400
Now say Ciao!

786
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,880
Don't fall asleep here you drunks!

787
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,120
Alright then.. be seeing you!

788
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,480
What are you doing?

789
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,040
I'm getting out our Charlie costumes.

790
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,680
There's a competition at school...

791
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,240
and all the kids have
to perform with their dads.

792
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,840
And there are prizes!

793
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,320
Keep that back!

794
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Why?

795
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,440
Because I said so...

796
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,440
But how will we win
if we don't rehearse?

797
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,080
Didn't you hear what I said?

798
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,600
Keep that back!

799
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,280
What's wrong?

800
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,720
What happened?

801
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,640
All I wanted was my costume...

802
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,400
Didn't you hear? I said no!

803
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,760
Get out of here!

804
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,960
I've come to realize you're
not the same person I left behind.

805
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,160
What do you want from me?

806
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,640
You want me to beg?

807
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,240
I'm Charlie!
Please give me some work ...

808
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,760
I'm Charlie! Please give me some work!

809
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,080
I don't know about that..

810
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,440
..but that's the Charlie I loved.

811
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,320
You use to be my hero.

812
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,080
I wanted our children to be like you.

813
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,440
But not anymore.

814
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,120
Chintu will perform at school...

815
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,000
without you!

816
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,160
I'm scared when he's angry

817
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,680
But when I'm scared to be alone,

818
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,000
I hold his hand and
know that everything's fine.

819
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,120
He's hardly ever home,

820
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,600
But every evening I eagerly
wait for him to return.

821
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,200
That's my daddy.

822
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,160
He grows with me a little every day.

823
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,400
His hair is turning
grey with all my mischief.

824
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,040
That's my daddy.

825
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,440
He re lives his
childhood along with mine

826
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,800
He lets go of his
dreams to fulfill mine.

827
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,160
My little feet love to
find their way into his shoes.

828
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,320
The man I try to walk,
sit and look like.

829
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,920
The man who is my hero.

830
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,920
That's my daddy.

831
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,200
He says I can be anyone
I want to be.

832
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,880
And make all my dreams come true.

833
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,880
The one who I am like
and the man I want to be,

834
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,440
that's my daddy...

835
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,160
That's my daddy.

836
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:44,000
And our next participant
is Chintu Singh.

837
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,960
I can't do this mom...

838
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,200
You will... I know it...

839
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,720
All the performances
today have been beautiful.

840
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,720
But it's time to
distribute the prizes.

841
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:39,840
Without a doubt, first place goes to
Chintu Singh and his father Charlie.

842
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,960
Congratulations!

843
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,480
Well done!

844
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
Let's have a round of applause!

845
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,880
I'm very happy.

846
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,760
That's what I told everyone.

847
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,240
But I lied.

848
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,000
How can anyone be happy
in someone else's skin?

849
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:28,400
After a long time,
today, I'm truly happy.

850
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,680
You have no idea how
much I've missed you.

851
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,680
I kept you locked in a box

852
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,120
But it was me who was getting suffocated

853
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,680
though I never let it show.

854
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,680
Ever since I remember,
I was Charlie... Charlie...

855
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,680
Hey Charlie!

856
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,240
I didn't know who Ramsingh was.

857
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,280
And when I met Ramsingh...

858
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,960
I didn't like him.

859
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,440
I thought you were making me weak.

860
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,920
But I realize today..

861
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,920
..you are my true strength.

862
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,600
I've found the courage I'd lost...

863
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I found my family again.

864
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,000
Don't you ever leave me.

865
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,240
With you beside me,

866
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,960
I can fight the world...

867
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,200
What?

868
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,600
What?

869
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,920
Hey!
- Hey!

870
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,760
Say something...
- Say something...

871
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,160
Enough!
- Enough!

872
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,320
Where are you off to?

873
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,720
Where are you off to?

874
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,960
Answer me...
- Answer me...

875
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,080
Now what's this?
- Now what's this?

876
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,240
I'm going to meet Masterji....

877
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,960
Will be home early today...

878
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,320
Thank you...

879
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,040
For turning Ramsingh
into Charlie again!

880
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,280
Charlie is here to meet you...

881
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,920
Ramsingh?
- Yes.

882
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yes...

883
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,080
Alright...

884
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,720
You can go inside...

885
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,840
Sir...? Isn't Masterji here?

886
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,080
I thought you're
here because you came to know.

887
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,440
Mom is no more.

888
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,880
We lost her two weeks ago.

889
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,760
She'd started keeping
ill after the circus shut down.

890
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,480
We thought she would
relax without all that stress.

891
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,800
I don't know what happened.

892
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,320
So what brings you here?

893
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,880
I met Masterji a while ago.

894
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,200
She told me about the circus
equipment at the warehouse

895
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,640
and said that if I wanted,
I could have it.

896
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,160
What will you do with it?

897
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,160
I'll open my own circus Sir...

898
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,200
Alright...

899
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,760
Gives me a reason
to empty the warehouse.

900
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,920
I'll wait here, you go have a look.

901
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,000
I know you will open
your own circus...

902
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,000
And I want you to.

903
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,880
You are the son I never had...

904
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,000
Here's the list of equipment Sir...

905
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,800
By when do you want to take this?

906
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,440
Whenever you say so...

907
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,000
Alright...

908
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,720
Make arrangements for all this.

909
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,040
And collect a cheque of Rs.
1,50,000 from him.

910
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,160
Sir...

911
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,080
I'm not asking for much Ramsingh...

912
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,000
Had it been anyone
else I'd ask for much more.

913
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,640
But you're family.

914
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,280
If Masterji was alive she'd never
put a price on the circus equipment!

915
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,440
He kept saying that he didn't know why

916
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,320
Masterji was keeping ill.

917
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,800
Anyone would die if you
stop them from breathing.

918
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,440
I've pitched circus
tents since I was a kid.

919
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,400
I was born in a circus.

920
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,440
You don't teach a fish how to swim.

921
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,000
I'll do it all...

922
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,440
on my own. Everything..

923
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,840
Earn money, build the circus,
sell the tickets and perform!

924
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,840
I'll do everything!

925
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,480
Be it small...

926
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
...but we'll have a circus...

927
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,840
Our own circus!

928
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,440
What is this?

929
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,400
Half of your circus.

930
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,320
I don't understand...

931
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,400
He's my nephew...

932
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,760
Fahim.

933
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,880
My brother's sold our ancestral land.

934
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,960
He's brought my share.

935
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,760
But you know me...

936
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,400
I spend money like royalty.

937
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,680
Won't take long for
the money to disappear.

938
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,840
So I want you to keep it.

939
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,000
For your circus...

940
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,000
Know what an investment is?

941
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,720
I'm investing in your dreams.

942
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,200
There are very few
dreamers in this world

943
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,000
Those who chase their
dreams are even fewer.

944
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,760
And those who fulfil them
are like a needle in a hay stack...

945
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,160
They're tough to find.

946
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,160
I know he's amazing! Someday
the world will look at him and say,

947
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,160
"Woah! He's set the room on fire!

948
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,240
Keep it my friend.

949
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,200
Take my nephew under your wing.

950
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,440
He'll make something of his life.

951
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,000
Or he'll turn into
a no-gooder like me...

952
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,400
What say you?

953
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,000
Will you work at our Circus?

954
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Careful now!

955
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,320
There you go...Good!

956
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,400
Ramsingh?

957
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,440
Yes Sir...

958
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,960
It's Protima's birthday the day after.

959
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,040
I'm having a small
party for the kids..

960
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,840
Would you perform for them?

961
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,040
Me?

962
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,960
The circus tricks that you do.
The kids will love them!

963
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,200
I'd love to...

964
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,000
...but I can't afford to stop work.

965
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,840
No you won't have to do that...

966
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,000
I'll pay you...

967
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,640
Rs. 1000? Will that do?

968
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,920
Rs. 1000!

969
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,760
I'll do it...

970
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,840
Definitely!

971
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,840
What else do you need to live

972
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:40,840
but little intent

973
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:45,000
The night can be long

974
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:51,480
but with a promise of daybreak

975
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,480
So this is our workshop...

976
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,880
Like it?

977
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,440
It's temporary,
we'll get a fancy office later.

978
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,240
Life is in a habit

979
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,880
Of laughing, crying and getting upset

980
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,200
Go for it!

981
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,040
But no one's interested....

982
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,880
A true artist performs for himself

983
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,880
and then the world
watches him perform...

984
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,200
Inhibited desires

985
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,760
Hidden desires

986
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:42,040
Speak with mirrors,
they will tell you the truth

987
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:47,880
You are your destination,

988
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,760
you are your path,

989
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,640
rest all gods are a lie

990
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:55,960
Donald Duck?
- No...

991
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,400
What about Chhota Bheem?
- No.

992
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,640
PokeMon? Dora?

993
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,760
Would a 'Jenny the hen Chicklet' do?

994
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,680
Jenny the hen?

995
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,840
It's a cartoon sir!
Kids go bonkers about it!

996
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,320
Really?

997
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Alright then...

998
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,240
The event guys didn't
pay me my money...

999
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,880
so I kept the costume.

1000
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
What else do you need to live

1001
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:27,240
but little intent

1002
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,080
The night can be long

1003
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:38,160
but with a promise of daybreak

1004
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,040
They're having a Christmas
fair at the school grounds.

1005
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,080
A carnival!

1006
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,120
So?

1007
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,080
You didn't get it....
It's a carnival!

1008
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,040
5000 is all we have...

1009
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,640
But that's only 50%...

1010
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:56,120
Sir, how about you
give us a 50% discount

1011
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,000
And we'll give 50% discount
to your students on the tickets.

1012
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,880
Today we are nowhere,

1013
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,960
and stagnant

1014
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,440
But someday

1015
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,400
Wandering,
we will fly and become news

1016
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,880
Jaidev left you his violin.

1017
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,960
He said give it to
Charlie when he comes.

1018
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,240
Let trouble remain in our habits

1019
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,680
Weave

1020
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,200
Weave your dreams

1021
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,960
Choose your destination clearly

1022
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,800
And then shout loudly

1023
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,120
What else do you need to live

1024
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,720
but little intent?

1025
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:49,000
The night can be long

1026
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,920
but with a promise of daybreak

1027
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,320
Yes, like that! Great!

1028
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,600
So, what did you say your name was?

1029
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,640
Short...

1030
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,120
And yours sir?

1031
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,400
Cut...

1032
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,920
Short... Cut...

1033
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I just remembered a joke..

1034
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,400
Please do!
- Promise me you'll laugh...

1035
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,240
Once...

1036
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,640
Short and Cut go to a hooker.

1037
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,920
Short couldn't do anything
with his dysfunctional thermostat,

1038
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,920
so Cut goes to the room.

1039
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,400
A few minutes later Short's passing by

1040
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,920
and hears strange noises from inside

1041
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,720
like 1-2-3 aaaaah!

1042
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,800
1-2-3 Aaaah!

1043
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,960
Cut to next morning they meet.

1044
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,120
Short asks Cut "why you look so low?

1045
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,720
you had such a wild night."

1046
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,120
Cut tells him..

1047
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,040
..that he didn't do a thing.

1048
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,480
Short asks why...

1049
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Cut says... "All night I
was just trying to get on the bed!"

1050
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,640
If it takes that long
for you to get on the bed..

1051
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,920
What about your wife..?

1052
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,080
Are you going to pay Nabeel?

1053
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,880
Will we get the equipment?

1054
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,840
Where are you going
with all the money?

1055
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,120
Cut's in the hospital.
He needs money for treatment...

1056
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,640
What about the circus?

1057
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,000
We need to set up
in the next two days...

1058
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,960
What will you tell the
people who are working so hard?

1059
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,600
We'll have our circus.

1060
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,080
I promise you that.

1061
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,280
How and where the money
will come from?...I don't know...

1062
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,240
We will have our circus!
But right now,

1063
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,000
Cut needs me. I have to go...

1064
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,640
Ramsingh, I can't hold on
to the circus equipment any longer.

1065
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,760
The rent for that warehouse is
more than the cost of all the stuff.

1066
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,080
You asked for two
months and I agreed.

1067
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,800
But I can't wait any longer.

1068
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,400
If you need anything else,
let me know.

1069
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,880
I need the...

1070
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,200
Sorry... I didn't get that...

1071
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,760
When I was a kid my father...

1072
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,480
without any occasion
would bring new clothes.

1073
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:56,680
Not just one but
a bunch of new shirts...

1074
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,920
I'd wear them and show off.

1075
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,800
I wouldn't stop smiling
for days after that.

1076
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,320
Later I realized that

1077
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:15,000
they were your used shirts..

1078
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,760
..which Masterji used to give my father.

1079
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,480
Still that didn't make me any less happy.

1080
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,760
Even if they were your hand-me-downs,

1081
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,760
for me they were as good as new.

1082
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:33,640
Today, I'm asking
for that same old shirt.

1083
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,800
I know the circus equipment
is of no use to you.

1084
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,600
But it could give me a new life.

1085
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:50,680
If you take that away from me then just
like Masterji I won't last long either...

1086
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,000
Are you trying to say
mom died because...

1087
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,200
Get out!

1088
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,600
That's not what I meant...
- I said leave!

1089
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,800
Come one! Come all!

1090
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,680
For the first time in town...

1091
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,760
Presenting Charlie
performed by Ramsingh!

1092
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,640
Come on in...

1093
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,800
I hope they don't
fight over the tickets.

1094
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,240
Ramsingh...

1095
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,920
...where will we keep all this money?

1096
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,880
Look at that ruckus over the tickets!

1097
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,000
Actually...

1098
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,080
It's all my fault...

1099
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,280
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1100
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,840
I sold my ancestral land!

1101
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,280
You know where I got all that money from.

1102
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,480
Rs. 92,000!

1103
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,720
I want my circus now!

1104
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,120
Anyhow!

1105
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,760
I'm warning you...

1106
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,880
Look at me!

1107
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,000
Look at me!

1108
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:16,800
Where is my circus?

1109
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,640
You know why you
can't look me in the eye?

1110
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Because you're a cheat...

1111
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,600
Charlie.

1112
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,920
Ramsingh, I'm sending
you all the circus equipment...

1113
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,920
even things that weren't in your list.

1114
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,440
I know you will reopen the circus.

1115
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,040
I'm not doing this for you or me...

1116
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,080
I'm doing this for mom.

1117
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,920
I just have one request.

1118
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,000
If possible, name it Jango Circus.

1119
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,680
I'm sure it will make mom happy...

1120
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,800
Everything is in the truck.

1121
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,920
A few stolen moments
from the realms of dreams

1122
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,280
With renewed hope my heart gleams

1123
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,120
A new luminescence shines upon me

1124
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,960
This new dawn promises
a beautiful new story

1125
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:08,840
To a new beginning I have woken

1126
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:17,640
"I'm right beside you"
life has spoken!

1127
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,400
A few stolen moments
from the realms of dreams

1128
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:28,040
With renewed hope my heart gleams

1129
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:32,800
A new luminescence shines upon me

1130
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,600
This new dawn promises
a beautiful new story

1131
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:45,320
To a new beginning I have woken

1132
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,000
We've lost Cut...

1133
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,160
...he's no more.

1134
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,320
God bless his soul.

1135
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,000
But that was one expensive
ticket to heaven.

1136
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,720
He almost shut down my circus!

1137
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,040
It's only thanks to Nabeel
that we even have a circus.

1138
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,160
You want your money?

1139
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,600
I'll return it...

1140
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:22,880
Return it?

1141
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,480
How?

1142
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,160
By giving me back the salary I'll pay you?

1143
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,600
That's great! Good thinking!

1144
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,480
I'll pay you the money
but I won't work for you!

1145
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,760
Get out of here!

1146
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,280
I can buy midgets like
you for a dime a dozen!

1147
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,600
Leave!

1148
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,640
Get out!

1149
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,800
I was the one who took money from you...

1150
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,160
...and promised you a circus.

1151
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,640
Here's the circus...

1152
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,760
And it's all yours!

1153
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,800
The decision of not
performing at the circus...

1154
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,600
I don't know if it's right or wrong.

1155
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,480
All I know is that...

1156
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,000
...we don't make the circus

1157
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,000
the circus makes us.

1158
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,800
You were born to do this.

1159
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,720
Shahjehan may be wrong,

1160
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,160
but for the next one week,

1161
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,800
as long as the circus stands,...

1162
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:17,160
...you should perform.
I'll be happy if you do that.

1163
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,080
Forget Ramsingh Charlie!
It's Fahim Charlie. Wear this!

1164
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,120
They think we can't
run the circus without them?

1165
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,720
To hell with them!

1166
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,000
Here... put this on.

1167
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,400
Here's our Charlie..

1168
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,680
All you need is the right
moustache and some make up.

1169
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,280
Take this! Show me your Charlie walk.

1170
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:04,600
Sir...

1171
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,120
Sir... This wasn't my idea.

1172
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,400
Uncle told me that...

1173
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,760
you're not coming this evening

1174
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,800
and we have to do the show.

1175
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,000
And since I was always with you..

1176
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,160
I should do Charlie.

1177
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,760
I swear it wasn't my idea.

1178
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,760
I can never take your place.

1179
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:36,080
Sir...sir.. I was only trying
to look like you. Sir...

1180
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,800
Charlie sir!

1181
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,000
Why don't you stop him? Charlie sir!

1182
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,880
Charlie sir please don't leave!

1183
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,960
Dad never looked back after that.

1184
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,480
The whole world became his stage.

1185
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,960
Till the time he had air in lungs,
he kept his working boots on.

1186
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,280
Dad...

1187
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,440
like all of us, you had your weaknesses...

1188
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,000
but all you gave your
children were your strengths.

1189
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,720
I feel like I'm your shadow.

1190
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:15,160
It may not be seen in the dark,
but is always there.

1191
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,840
We eventually become the shadow
of the people our parents were.

1192
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,040
Not everyone wins this
marathon that we call life,

1193
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,240
but every father keeps
running till his last breath,

1194
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,680
so that he can give wings to his children.

1195
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,240
You always told me...

1196
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,600
that I could never lose...

1197
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,160
...because you'd lost
enough for the both of us.

1198
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,400
I know Papa that the
rickshaw you pulled as Ramsingh,

1199
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,280
was not ferrying anyone
else but our family

1200
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,160
As for Charlie he lives on through me,

1201
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,760
eager to perform on a new stage
and explore new dreams and aspirations.

1202
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:14,480
He still remembers that

1203
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,400
a true artist
performs for himself

1204
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,200
and then the world
watches him perform
