00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,669
<i>Quick-fix.</i>

3
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,755
<i>In Punjab, there's a quick-fix</i>
<i>for every problem.</i>

4
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,174
<i>Coming to the problem... </i>

5
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,803
<i>The biggest problem</i>
<i>amongst youngsters these days</i>

6
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>is getting married </i>
<i>according to their will.</i>

7
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,516
<i>But there's a quick-fix for that too.</i>

8
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,812
<i>A website... </i>
<i>and it's called Running Shaadi.</i>

9
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,232
{\an8}Love marriage only lasts
for a couple of months.

10
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,818
{\an8}Soon after they get fed up,
file for divorce.

11
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,194
{\an8}It's not advisable.

12
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,738
{\an8}It's spoiling the society.

13
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,032
{\an8}Parents always do the right thing.

14
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,285
{\an8}It's upsetting the apple cart.

15
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,121
{\an8}No, no. Running away
and getting married isn't right.

16
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,497
{\an8}<i>Why would anyone want</i>
<i>to run away and get married?</i>

17
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,251
{\an8}<i>Because their parents aren't allowing them</i>

18
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,878
{\an8}<i>or there are problems in the society,</i>

19
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,754
{\an8}<i>like caste and creed problems.</i>

20
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,965
{\an8}So I feel Running Shaadi is a good thing.

21
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,050
{\an8}At least they understand our problems.

22
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,302
{\an8}Parents will never agree.

23
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,803
{\an8}So, we'll have to run away
and get married.

24
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,972
If someone wants to run away,
they will run away.

25
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,349
So why not do it in a systematic way.

26
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,476
This is exactly why
Running Shaadi was created.

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,853
It's a great site.

28
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,897
I'll use it if I have to.

29
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,371
Have you lost your mind?

30
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,124
Don't you understand
what I am trying to say?

31
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,959
Don't worry about the price, madam.
We'll give you a good deal.

32
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,002
Just choose one.

33
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,129
Their entire wedding was ruined!

34
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,340
The driver didn't know the way.

35
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,842
Nimmi, come here.

36
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,763
What kind of skirt are you wearing?

37
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,681
Is this the way to go to school?

38
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,892
-Chotu.
-Yes.

39
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,101
Take her to the tailor

40
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,978
and ask him to stitch
a longer skirt for her.

41
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,938
Yes.

42
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,606
Uncle is in a really bad mood today.

43
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,276
He even gave a hard time to Tanny brother.

44
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,240
What's wrong with you?

45
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,866
That Jobanmeet Bajaj.

46
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,493
Did he tease you?

47
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,706
He proposed to me on Valentine's Day.

48
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,126
I went on a date with him.

49
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,172
I...

50
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,220
-I missed my period.
-Cover it up in the tuitions.

51
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,100
We had sex!

52
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,364
You're still too young to be doing that.

53
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,492
-But I--
-You're still in school!

54
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,622
Listen...

55
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,083
Listen, please...

56
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,961
If my father finds out,
I'll get in big trouble.

57
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,675
Please do something. Please.

58
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,565
What?

59
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,526
We're supposed to go play a match
on behalf of the school.

60
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,695
We leave in the morning
and come back the next day.

61
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,918
How many weeks has it been?

62
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,671
Ten.

63
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,386
I don't understand,
what do you boys have against condoms!

64
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,046
<i>There's something.</i>

65
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:08,386
<i>Because the winds have changed</i>

66
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,013
<i>There's something</i>

67
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:17,770
<i>Because I can feel a restlessness</i>

68
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,412
So Nimmi,
which course did you finally choose?

69
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,207
English Honors.
It's got the most amazing crowd.

70
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,587
<i>Life is smiling</i>

71
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:47,133
<i>The paths are tranquil</i>

72
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,762
<i>The dawn and dusk</i>
<i>Are meeting over the horizon</i>

73
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:57,643
<i>Something's definitely special</i>

74
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,409
Get down here. I'll go from here.

75
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,205
-I'll drop you.
-No, only students are allowed inside.

76
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:23,628
<i>Please stay, don't go</i>

77
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>Don't let me spend my evenings alone</i>

78
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,803
<i>Please stay, don't go</i>

79
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:38,226
<i>Don't let me spend my evenings alone</i>

80
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,648
<i>What is life trying to convey?</i>

81
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,985
<i>These moments are going away</i>

82
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,907
<i>My desires are scattered</i>

83
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:58,955
<i>And I'm trying to count my blessings</i>

84
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,429
You're obsessed.

85
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,889
You keep calling me every minute.

86
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,808
When I call, you goddamned pick up.

87
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,393
What do you want from me?

88
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,936
-You want me to sit on your lap all day?
-I...

89
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,854
Don't I have friends, don't I have a life?

90
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,148
-I just want to know who I am.
-What?

91
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,150
-Exactly, who am I?
-What?

92
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,902
-Yes, what?
-Let me tell you what you are.

93
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,904
You're an illiterate idiot,
that's what you are.

94
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,367
I think we should remain just friends.

95
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,498
That we already are.

96
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,669
Fine, then let's stay that way.

97
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,296
Fine!

98
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,990
-Kartar.
-Yes, brother.

99
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,325
Did you deliver Mrs. Dhillon's order?

100
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,534
It's ready.

101
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,425
-Are you okay?
-Absolutely fine.

102
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,473
-It's my birthday tomorrow.
-I know.

103
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,102
Dad's throwing a party
at Kings Retreat tomorrow.

104
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,270
I know.

105
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,230
Are you coming?

106
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,399
Are you asking me or inviting me?

107
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,862
It's an invitation.

108
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,368
You must come. I'll be waiting for you.

109
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,797
-Chotu.
-Uncle.

110
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,131
Where were you?

111
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,800
There's so much to do.

112
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,804
Hey, mister, you wanted
sauce and ajinamoto, didn't you?

113
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,097
Chotu...

114
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,516
I don't know what I was thinking.

115
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,434
I forgot to pickup the cake.

116
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,148
Excuse me, we had ordered for a cake.

117
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,650
-Is this the one?
-Yes, that's the one.

118
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,362
The catering guys didn't arrange for ice.

119
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,072
Uncle's screwing me for the goof-up.

120
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,263
Nimmi.

121
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,015
Happy birthday.

122
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,644
-Finally, you found time to come.
-I... I...

123
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,147
Nimmi, come on, it's your birthday party.

124
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,148
What are you doing?

125
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,316
-Just a minute, I'll--
-Everyone's waiting.

126
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,818
What's wrong with you? Come on.

127
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:26,972
Yes?

128
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,558
-Greetings, uncle.
-What is the matter?

129
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,188
Remember that girl from
Patna you spoke to me about.

130
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,566
-If she's still interested...
<i>-Then?</i>

131
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,653
It's a yes from me.

132
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,741
I'm hanging up now,
talk to you later. Bye.

133
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,159
Why are you calling me?

134
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,745
You guys mess up everything
and I have to face the music!

135
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,455
Mrs. Dhillon's been calling me.

136
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,165
This is not my job, get it?

137
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,293
Do you know to do your job or not?
What the hell are you doing out there?

138
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,586
Stop arguing and hang up.

139
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,505
The embroidery is just pathetic.

140
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,006
Even the delivery isn't on time.

141
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,258
This isn't the first
time we got it done from you.

142
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,385
Your earlier work was impeccable.
What happened now?

143
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,720
It's such a shabby job!

144
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,430
This is not even wearable.

145
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,807
I'll call Ratni.

146
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,350
How much is it going to be?

147
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,354
You guys don't do your job
and I get blamed for it!

148
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,648
Call the guy and tell him
to take his stuff back.

149
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,068
-What is this?
-You tell me uncle what's going on here.

150
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,154
You appointed a stupid supervisor
for quality control.

151
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,866
And cheap workers at half the rate

152
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,742
are not doing their job.

153
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,119
The order was bound to get rejected.

154
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,495
How did the order get rejected?

155
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,163
Were you sleeping?

156
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,832
This is your responsibility.

157
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,335
What are you saying, uncle?
What responsibility?

158
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,297
Even you know that you do what you like.

159
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,756
What are you saying?

160
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,675
There's no planning at all.
No one knows what to do.

161
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,051
I wonder how you're still in business.

162
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,887
-Nothing is happening.
-What planning--

163
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,555
You couldn't even
organize a birthday party properly.

164
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,056
-Birthday party?
-Of course.

165
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,433
What about the birthday party?

166
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,727
-Why not?
-What was the problem in the party?

167
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,686
What was your plan?

168
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,063
You employed a stupid caterer
only to save a few bucks.

169
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,107
It was your daughter's birthday after all.

170
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,026
You could've celebrated grandly
by spending a bit more.

171
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,319
But you had to be such a miser.

172
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,696
Everything was fine. Everyone enjoyed.

173
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,906
You guys were enjoying,

174
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,033
because I was slogging
like a donkey until midnight.

175
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,951
Get it. It was 1:00 a.m.

176
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,288
I brought the slab of ice at 1:00 a.m.
while you were drunk and dancing.

177
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,626
If I don't enjoy, then who else will? You?

178
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,961
Just because I give you a little credit,

179
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,546
you think you're my boss now.

180
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,883
If I hadn't picked you up
from the streets,

181
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,260
then you would've been out slogging
driving a rickshaw.

182
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,762
Get back to your work.

183
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,430
I said go.

184
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,432
We'll discuss this at lunch-time,
there are customers now--

185
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,391
Shut up!

186
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,147
I said go.

187
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,180
If Singh 'N' Singh can do without me,

188
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,391
then even I can do
without Singh 'N' Singh.

189
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,642
Then do it.

190
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,935
After working hard for so long,

191
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,645
he says drive a rickshaw.

192
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,564
Did I come here to drive a rickshaw?

193
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,984
Whatever happened was for your own good.

194
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,610
What was good about it?

195
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,071
What could you have possibly
achieved in Singh 'N' Singh?

196
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,533
You think he would've
made you his son-in-law?

197
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,910
You were treating them more like family.

198
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,375
This is exactly why I asked
you to join me two years ago.

199
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,253
But you were so loyal to him.

200
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,797
"They're like family."

201
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,424
Now you've to pay.

202
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,134
Try to understand, son.

203
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,760
It's a small city.

204
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,179
Everyone knows everyone here.

205
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,058
And if Ratni Uncle
isn't positive about you,

206
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,686
then no one will be willing
to support you in this market.

207
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:07,026
That's fine, uncle,
but why did you have to say all that?

208
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,986
You see son, that Sinha...

209
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,197
He was making such tall claims
about his daughter.

210
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,116
<i>And I didn't exactly lie to him.</i>

211
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,325
I just told him the truth.

212
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,537
After all, my nephew works
in Amritsar, Punjab.

213
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,414
So, what date did you fix?

214
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,666
The date is nine months later,

215
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,919
<i>-when she turns 18.</i>
-Eighteen?

216
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,255
There should be a decent gap in the age,

217
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,673
<i>for things to go smooth.</i>

218
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,552
You know what,
just add the girl on Facebook

219
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,888
and send her romantic messages.

220
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,807
-Understand?
-Okay, uncle.

221
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,100
This hand too...

222
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,562
Okay, I must take care of your cousin now.
He's messing things up.

223
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,398
I mean...

224
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,525
-You must show this--
-Show what?

225
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,527
-You couldn't shoot a small--
-Just one spoon at night,

226
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,945
and everything will be clear
in the morning.

227
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,614
All clear in the morning.

228
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,742
-Cut it!
-Constipation relieved. Stomach cleared!

229
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,535
Just one pill at night
and all clear in the morning.

230
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,745
Cut! Cut.

231
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,704
Very nice.

232
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,122
Hey, empty-hard disk.

233
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,959
Why is that guy
from Patna giving you his girl?

234
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,545
Don't they prefer IAS guys.

235
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,380
Now you're screwing with me too.

236
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,176
I am hungry, let's go eat.

237
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,221
There's a wedding, would you like to come?

238
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,265
-Whose?
-What do you care?

239
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,101
It's a non-veg party.

240
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,977
Free meal for us.

241
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,648
Isn't that guy from Patna
giving you a car or something?

242
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,650
I don't want anything.

243
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,949
What's your fetish with Russian salad?

244
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,997
I'll go get us a soft-drink.

245
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,089
So finally you got the time to call back.

246
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,549
I was a little busy?

247
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,342
Of course, I know where you've been busy.

248
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,303
You just got your wedding fixed.

249
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,517
Well, I can't be taking
your permission for everything.

250
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,236
Show me her picture?

251
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,541
I hope we're still friends.

252
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,134
If you ever need anything... call me.

253
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,469
Take care.

254
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,780
What?

255
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,372
Ran away!

256
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,293
How did she run away?
How did she run away?

257
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,754
I have invited over thousand guests.

258
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,631
And you're telling me she ran away.

259
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,673
Stop...

260
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,926
Stop the music!

261
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,054
Don't just stand there, go find her!

262
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,263
Go!

263
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,475
She shouldn't have run away so soon.

264
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,851
She did the right thing.

265
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,395
At least she had the courage
to keep her commitment.

266
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,857
Her guts made me miss my Russian salad.

267
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,027
Come on! Get down!

268
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,820
Who do you think you are?

269
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,407
Why are they bashing him up?

270
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,451
Wait...

271
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,744
How dare try to elope with the girl?

272
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,079
You don't need to get involved.

273
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,294
They were so close.

274
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,090
If only they had planned this out,

275
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,761
they could've run away and got married.

276
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,848
Well, the mind doesn't think
straight in such situations.

277
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,393
It's totally screwed.

278
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,603
How will they plan it out?

279
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,484
Well, see you in the morning.

280
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,669
Cyber... listen...

281
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,379
What was the name of that Windows guy?

282
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,757
Actually, he's still around. Bill Gates.

283
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,551
I have a really great idea, like he did.

284
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,721
Remember last night's incident?

285
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:53,061
If someone had provided a quick-fix
or planned for that boy and girl, then...

286
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,022
Then what?

287
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,316
They could've eloped successfully
and got married.

288
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:58,942
Meaning?

289
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,153
Meaning we provide a kind of a service

290
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,114
for those who want
to run away and get married.

291
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,700
Then all the problems will be solved.

292
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,828
Dot com!

293
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,461
Look, I have been thinking about

294
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,046
building a website like Facebook.

295
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,467
Let's combine both the ideas,
and make a website.

296
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,719
People make websites
for arranged marriage.

297
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,387
We'll make one for running marriages.

298
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,555
RunningShaadi.

299
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,395
Give me your card.

300
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,605
Card.

301
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,608
My card got stuck in the ATM last night.

302
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,039
Forget this ego.

303
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,750
Go and meet him once.

304
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,045
-What are you doing here?
-It's my father's shop.

305
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,547
But what are you doing here?

306
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,217
Trying to call Tanny,
but he isn't answering.

307
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,219
Papa sent him to Jalandhar for some work.

308
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,057
What is it?

309
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,352
I want to buy something from the internet,
I just needed his credit card.

310
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,480
-Buy from the internet?
-Yes, so?

311
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,399
-You?
-So?

312
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,068
I am sure you can.

313
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,780
After all, even you have
14 friends on Facebook now.

314
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,034
-Take my card.
-How can I take your card?

315
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,452
Do you want it or not?

316
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,502
What mess are you
two are getting into now?

317
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,587
What website is this?

318
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,174
-Mind your own business.
-Shut your mouth.

319
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,342
Will you be quiet?

320
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,635
Done?

321
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,103
-You should say thank you.
-Welcome not.

322
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,824
It's Bhangara-night (dance night) in my
college tonight.

323
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,492
Would you come?

324
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,077
What will I do there?

325
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,913
You'll be busy with your friends.

326
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,333
Fine. I'll go with Shunty instead.

327
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,295
He's been chasing me for a long time now.

328
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,755
Bye.

329
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,016
Dance nights with Shunty.

330
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,726
What do you care?

331
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,062
Make the website.

332
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,441
But first we must know
how will we help them elope?

333
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,529
I had to cancel my afternoon
date with Shunty for you.

334
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,450
Even we took a big risk
for you in the Jobanmeet case.

335
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,368
Shut your mouth
and mind your own business.

336
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,453
Control him.

337
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,455
Even if you don't take a bath,

338
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,123
-at least use a deodorant.
-She's right.

339
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,006
What's this now?

340
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,257
It's for our safety.

341
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,301
Aunt Neetu has seen me
many times at the shop.

342
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,260
What if she recognizes me?

343
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,178
Start.

344
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,055
Doesn't matter if it's 2013 or 2063,

345
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,765
parents never change.

346
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,600
Take Nimmi for instance.

347
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,851
Do you know her dad?

348
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,354
He's not going to ask
for her advice for her marriage.

349
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,564
Ratni's going to think

350
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,857
that he's the only smart guy around.

351
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,152
And that's why these lovers
run away and get married.

352
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,364
You know, Sweety and Ashu
from Sandhu colony,

353
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,407
their's was an internet case.

354
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,410
From chatting on Facebook,

355
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,454
we moved on to Skyping each other.

356
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,832
And without even a single meeting,

357
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,584
we knew we were made for each other.

358
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,213
-But our parents were old-fashioned.
-We were from different caste.

359
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,382
And so, we went to the Gurdwara in Ambala,

360
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,592
spoke with the priest and got married.

361
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,844
Later, the priest gave us a certificate

362
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,430
and we got the marriage registered.

363
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,352
So how did your family react to it?

364
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,645
Tell us...

365
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,189
How do you think
the family was going to react?

366
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,942
They sent Raje Mama after us.

367
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,568
The local gangster.

368
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,737
And he troubled us a lot. He was insane.

369
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,114
Chased us all over!

370
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,908
-Your sister-in-law is from Himachal.
-I see.

371
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,868
-Yes, yes.
-And I am from Punjab.

372
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,121
So that's an inter-state
and inter-caste problem.

373
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,624
But we booked our marriage
under the Special Marriage Act.

374
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,085
The lawyers do the maximum job.

375
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,879
If you can find decent lawyer,
he gets the job done for you.

376
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,258
Who's it going to be?

377
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,470
-How about him?
-He looks more like the bad guy.

378
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,638
Definitely not him.

379
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,975
Let's keep looking.

380
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,484
Is the guy local or NRI?

381
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,367
-He's local.
-And the girl?

382
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,119
You might say she's local too.

383
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,329
Well then, let's just say
she's local then.

384
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,580
You see, local's easier.

385
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,914
Lasts longer, you see.

386
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,042
Tell us the procedure.

387
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,336
Just get me the age proof
for the girl and boy.

388
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,005
Along with their photos and two witnesses

389
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,673
who should be their relatives as well.

390
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,674
That's all.

391
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,594
What if they don't have relatives?

392
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,803
No problem.

393
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,013
What are we here for?

394
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,015
We'll get the witnesses.

395
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,601
But... it will cost you extra.

396
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:30,857
Brother, what's the Special Marriage Act?

397
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,818
Special Marriage Act is an act
made by the Parliament of India,

398
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,279
according to which any girl of caste,
creed and color,

399
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,989
can marry any boy of any caste,
creed and color.

400
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,449
It is a very Orthodox
and ortho-modular law,

401
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,451
made by the parliament of India.

402
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,453
Sanctioned by Parliament of India.

403
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,998
I mean to say, for those special cases.

404
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,626
He looks greedy, he'll definitely say yes.

405
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,879
-Brother...
-Yes.

406
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,006
What's the matter?

407
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,428
That is a big matter,
it's a really big matter, brother.

408
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,140
Tell me something, brother.

409
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,102
How many cases do you get every day?

410
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,020
Summing up an average is difficult.

411
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:13,316
But I do see the judge twice a week.

412
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,318
What if we make you see him every day?

413
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,319
Every day?

414
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,071
You get an average of two to three cases.

415
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,364
How do you survive with that?

416
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,157
Who says it's enough to survive.

417
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,576
It's barely enough
to afford one square meal.

418
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,496
Exactly our point. We'll make sure that
you can't just afford full square meals,

419
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,123
but throw in a feast every day.

420
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,833
In fact, we'll make sure
sister-in-law enjoys it too.

421
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,670
Don't drag her into this! It's a very
touchy issue, I am warning you.

422
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,921
I won't do your job.

423
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,798
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

424
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,805
You just have to get us earlier dates

425
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,099
under the Special Marriage Act.

426
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,394
-And some priority.
-Yes.

427
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,770
Fine...

428
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,441
Deal... done!

429
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,413
Take their blessings first.

430
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,583
We're no less than Mark Zuckerburg
ourselves now.

431
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,675
What now?

432
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,761
Wait for people to upload their profile.

433
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,475
But how will the people
know about our site?

434
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,893
Hey, intelligent couples...

435
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,438
Whenever there's a sale at shop

436
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:38,610
Papa would go to that Popular Press guy,
for printing the pamphlets.

437
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,487
Yeah, I know.
I would take the design to him.

438
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,238
So do just that.

439
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,784
-She's right.
-I am always right by default, you fool.

440
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,953
Well, see you.

441
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,413
It's Shunty's birthday.

442
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,584
Best of luck for your ventures.

443
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,338
She's got only one thing on her mind.

444
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,174
"Shunty! Shunty! Shunty! Shunty!"

445
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,967
You've got work to do, don't you?

446
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,844
So stop doing Shunty!
Shunty! Shunty! Shunty!

447
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,765
Happy birthday to you.

Sit, sit.

484
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,670
Monkey caps?

485
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,967
Actually, our job is a little risky.

486
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,010
So this is for safety.

487
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,929
Intelligent, sir.

488
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,347
Cyber.

489
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,308
It's a Bengali and Punjabi case.

490
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,311
Thing is, when I was doing
my engineering from Delhi.

491
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,063
I met her for the first time.

492
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,107
And since then were together-together.

493
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,316
Great.

494
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,943
But now her family knows everything.

495
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,196
Her family has arranged her marriage
with a NRI person from Canada.

496
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,410
Tell me something,
what date is your wedding?

497
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,870
Tenth of next month.

498
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,377
By the way, madam, are you sure
that you want to marry him?

499
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,587
-I mean...
-What do you mean by this?

500
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,425
Shonku is the most brainiest person
I have ever known, okay.

501
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,137
-Stop racking your brain.
-Good mental, good mental.

502
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,182
-It's a good thing.
-Well, madam, tell me

503
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,020
why does your family have
a problem with such a brainy guy?

504
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,190
I don't know what allergy
does mom have against Bengalis.

505
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,570
But I have made it clear,
I am not going to marry any NRI.

506
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,780
-That was wrong.
-What?

507
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:59,245
Look, first go home,
and patch up with your family.

508
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,289
And assure them,

509
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,541
that you're ready to marry the NRI.

510
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,295
And then from tomorrow morning,
start jogging.

511
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,590
-Jogging?
-Yes, jogging.

512
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,301
From tomorrow, every morning
at 7:00 a.m. you must go jogging

513
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,886
in the park near your home.

514
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,137
Your parents will think that

515
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,264
you're trying to get healthy
for the wedding.

516
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,223
Preparing yourself.

517
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:20,892
They will relax.

518
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,436
And maintain this pattern
for the next couple of days.

519
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,688
And on the fourth day,

520
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,442
you'll see our red i10
parked next to the park.

521
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,570
Just go and sit quietly in the car.

522
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,990
<i>Run, Milky</i>

523
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,870

524
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:45,208
<i>Run, Milky</i>

525
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,961
<i>Run, Milky</i>

526
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,550
<i>You're destined to be made for someone</i>

527
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:58,638
<i>So just go find him yourself</i>

528
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,643
<i>You're destined to be sent off one day</i>

529
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:07,563
<i>So why not send yourself away?</i>

530
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:14,737
<i>Just convey what's in your heart</i>
<i>Without speaking a word</i>

531
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,492
<i>Run, Milky</i>

532
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,913
<i>Run, Milky</i>

533
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:29,710
<i>Just run, Milky</i>

534
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,506
<i>Run, Milky</i>

535
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:47,436
<i>Love should be kept away from the world</i>

536
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:56,737
<i>Do something to make love famous</i>

537
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,615
<i>You came in this world with bare-feet</i>

538
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:04,745
<i>So now you must run bare-feet, dear girl</i>

539
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,008
<i>Run, Milky</i>

540
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:22,054
<i>Run, Milky</i>

541
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,767
<i>Run, Milky</i>

542
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,730
<i>Run, Milky</i>

543
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:35,610
<i>Run, Milky</i>

544
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,758
{\an8}It's completely a filmy case.
Raj is Hindu and Shaziya is Muslim.

545
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,885
So it's the Special Marriage Act case.

546
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,263
My family is getting me
married forcefully.

547
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,432
Very big mess management package.

548
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,644
Believe that you're the real police.

549
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,103
Sit straight.

550
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,605
Bravo.

551
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,648
Now go.

552
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,443
Go on.

553
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,575
Straight

554
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,622
I'll slap you.

555
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,378
-Why is he sneaking in like a thief?
-Because he's stupid.

556
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,353
<i>All your troubles and love problems</i>

557
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,106
<i>All your troubles and love problems</i>
<i>Will be settled</i>

558
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,483
Have you seen a girl here, with a guy?

559
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,654
Cyber, get those two out from the back.

560
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,947
They seem like her brothers.

561
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,740
-Come on, come on.
-Hurry up.

562
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,158
Quickly, run. It's a bigger problem.

563
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,410
-Come on.
-Where are you taking them?

564
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,494
This is Hindu-Muslim problem.

565
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,954
It's a sensitive matter.

566
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,832
Do you have a place
to hide the boy and girl?

567
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:20,172
<i>When Dimpy runs away with Bunty</i>

568
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,342
<i>When Shunty elopes with Minty</i>

569
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,554
<i>When Dimpy runs away with Bunty</i>

570
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,558
<i>When Shunty elopes with cute Minty</i>

571
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,645
-Bro...
-Yeah?

572
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:40,609
-Hear me out. I have a request.
-Go on.

573
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,697
I want a runaway wedding as well.

574
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:53,039
Your future sister-in-law's
children are such rascals.

575
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,666
They don't agree to our wedding.

576
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,294
But I want to marry her.

577
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,926
Actually, we can't live
without each other.

578
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,305
But our parents,
they just don't seem to agree.

579
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,515
Can you do something?

580
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,604
Well, love doesn't
distinguish between genders.

581
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,772
{\an8}It just happens.

582
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,025
{\an8}<i>Nothing to worry</i>
<i>The roads are ready</i>

583
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,778
{\an8}<i>And the cops have been dealt with</i>

584
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,071
You're still a minor.

585
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,781
You two want to get married, don't you?

586
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,157
Come back next year.

587
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,116
Now go.

588
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,330
{\an8}<i>One day there will be screaming</i>
<i>And shouting and full on worry</i>

589
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,376
{\an8}<i>People will brandish their swords</i>
<i>And fire in the air</i>

590
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,339
Shit!

591
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,465
Brother.

592
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,551
Brother? But who told them where we are.

593
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,179
There's no time to think about that.

594
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,390
We must first think about their safety.

595
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,725
Or else they will kill us.

596
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,685
Here's the marriage certificate.

597
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,063
This is the marriage certificate.

598
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,691
Show it to this gentlemen as well.

599
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,110
Take a look.

600
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,906
So legally they are husband and wife.

601
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,659
You guys must stop fighting now.

602
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,702
And if you resort to any kind of violence,

603
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,705
they've already been
given police protection.

604
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,792
I think it's better that you two parties
reach a compromise.

605
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,335
Great.

606
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,379
Come on, stand up and shake hands.

607
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,298
Bravo, bravo, come on.

608
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,550
Do it.

609
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,094
A round of applause everyone.

610
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,973
Have sweets. Eat it.

611
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,102
He who utters the name of Guru,
victory is his.

612
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,562
We've a new problem.

613
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,816
Some Simran, who wants
a musical nite before she runs away.

614
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,568
Stupid.

615
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,195
These things are very important for girls.

616
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,282
They are right to demand
for a Bollywood style musical nite.

617
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,367
What to do?

618
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,417
Stop staring at me.

619
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,634
<i>The biggest problem </i>
<i>amongst youngsters these days</i>

620
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,511
<i>is getting married</i>
<i>according to their will.</i>

621
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,014
<i>But there's a quick-fix for that too.</i>

622
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:19,977
A website, and it's called RunningShaadi.

623
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,814
<i>Welcome to our studio.</i>

624
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,608
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,943
My first question, why a website?

626
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,529
You see, we never think why,

627
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,114
we think why not.

628
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,451
Marriage is a huge business
in our country.

629
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,662
There's already a number
of matrimonial websites.

630
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,207
This could be the only
new variation in matrimony.

631
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,291
RunningShaadi.

632
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:47,046
The youngsters are very
happy with this website.

633
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:51,175
At least they understand our problems.

634
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,886
Parents will never agree.
So we'll have to run away and get married.

635
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,971
If someone wants to run away,
they will run away.

636
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,140
So why not do it in a systematic manner.

637
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,644
But elders, they are not very happy.

638
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,437
It's not advisable.

639
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,606
It's spoiling the society.

640
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,317
No, no, running away
and getting married isn't right.

641
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,422
Get me some water.

642
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,217
And some fritters.

643
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:37,972
Hello, sir.

644
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,809
-Password?
-Sukhi31.

645
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,520
Hello.

646
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,899
So it was you guys
who helped Jaspreet elope?

647
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,401
Jaspreet Dhillon?

648
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,652
Yes.

649
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,529
I guess she referred you to us.

650
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,448
She is my sister.

651
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,286
Lucky, come out, guys.

652
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,328
-Brother...
-Run.

653
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,663
Take off their caps.

654
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,915
Let's see who they are.

655
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,542
Police.

656
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:29,982
Little.

657
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,567
Little, wake up.

658
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,236
Wake up.

659
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,700
What happened?

660
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,871
-There's a big problem.
-What happened?

661
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,541
Remember that lady doctor
from the Jobanmeet matter?

662
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,418
<i>The stupid wretch came to my shop.</i>

663
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,795
<i>Madam, she's my daughter.</i>

664
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,132
<i>-Your daughter?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

665
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,009
<i>She told dad everything.</i>

666
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,386
<i>My dad lost his mind.</i>

667
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,848
<i>There's some Gurwinder Bhatti</i>
<i>and he's fixed my marriage with him.</i>

668
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,808
I don't want to marry him.

669
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,856
What do you want to do?

670
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,028
-Love marriage?
-With whom?

671
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,655
With you.

672
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,076
Stop joking with me in the morning.

673
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,829
Yes, I was joking.

674
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,123
Who's going to marry you, stupid?

675
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,667
Have you seen your face?

676
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,960
I want to marry Shunty.

677
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,630
-Shunty?
-Yes.

678
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,132
You two have come this far,
you didn't tell me.

679
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,095
You want me to take your
permission for everything.

680
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,721
It's not about permission.

681
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,141
Your love's always too instant.

682
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,435
I can see that
Jobanmeet matter repeating again.

683
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,522
Stop lecturing me now.

684
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,360
Then why did you come here?

685
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,905
To invite me to your wedding?

686
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,951
Shunty is Tejpal uncle's son.

687
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,623
Great. Then uncle will
definitely get you two married.

688
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:12,626
How intelligent! That's exactly
why I came asking for your help.

689
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,296
-What can I do?
-RunningShaadi.

690
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,341
Help me run away.

691
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,468
Are you crazy? What can I do?

692
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,263
Stop behaving like that.
Didn't I help you out?

693
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,932
Try to understand, I can't do this.

694
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,560
Uncle will think I am just taking revenge.

695
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,270
And your brother, he's my friend.

696
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,522
Don't get me
involved in this mess, get it?

697
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,691
I don't get all this.

698
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,527
You're worried about uncle and my brother.

699
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,320
And I am trouble?

700
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,738
Great.

701
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,409
Nimmi, try to understand.

702
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,494
I understand.

703
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,456
Fine.

704
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,501
-Listen...
-What?

705
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,045
Even you ended up using me.

706
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,177
Fine, I understand. It's okay.

707
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,429
I'll handle it.

708
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,809
But, yes. Do me a favor.

709
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,854
Don't tell Tanny anything.

710
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,481
Can you do that much?

711
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,652
Thank you.

712
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,619
<i>That girl is like a virus in your life.</i>

713
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,204
<i>Don't be a fool.</i>

714
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,873
Don't let this fan the fire
between Uncle and you.

715
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,501
And isn't Tanny your friend?

716
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,127
You want to help her sister elope?

717
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,795
You're a weird guy.

718
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,882
And what about your own wedding?

719
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,343
You're supposed to leave
for Patna in two weeks.

720
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,553
Don't get in to this mess.

721
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,142
Dad misses you too.

722
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,938
You should meet him once before you go.

723
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,064
It'll be the right thing to do.

724
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,320
Tell me more.

725
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,706
How can you think like that, Nimmi?

726
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,173
Just quietly marry whoever
your father wants you to.

727
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,634
You'll automatically fall in love.

728
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,053
Stop lecturing me on love.

729
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,515
You said yes to that Bihari girl
out of desperation.

730
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,392
And now you're advising me.

731
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,104
I wasn't desperate.

732
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,110
I just didn't see a future with you,
so I quietly moved on.

733
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,405
Fine, so let me move on too.

734
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,116
I asked for a small favor,
and you couldn't do that either.

735
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,618
-Tanny is like a brother.
-Am I your enemy?

736
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,204
No attachment with me?

737
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,706
That's exactly why
I am trying to explain you.

738
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,166
You just recently met that guy.

739
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,876
Get to know him first.

740
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,171
-You're being hasty.
-How can you say I don't know Shunty?

741
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,923
You want to know?

742
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,092
-Have you met him?
-I don't want to meet him,

743
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,469
-you're the one getting married.
-But you're going to help me elope.

744
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,929
Let's meet him. Meet him once.

745
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,306
Now you're forcing me.

746
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,390
-Come on.
-But--

747
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,558
Let's go meet him.

748
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,484
He's here.

749
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:32,701
Hi, baby.

750
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,209
Hi. Myself Daljeet Kapoor,
also known as Shunty.

751
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,254
I have told him everything about you.

752
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,380
Don't let us down.

753
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,758
We want to elope day after tomorrow.

754
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,972
But where will you go?

755
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,974
We'll settle down in Delhi.

756
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,517
He's already got a job in an MNC.

757
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,269
And tomorrow is his induction.

758
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,562
He's an MBA.

759
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,401
Fine, I...

760
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,112
-I'll do something.
-Thanks.

761
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,530
Really appreciate it.

762
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,408
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

763
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,826
Sure?

764
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,371
Thank you.

765
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,123
Didn't I tell you he'll help us?

766
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,002
Even I am marrying someone else, right?

767
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,214
So even she has a right,
to move on in life.

768
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,840
Right.

769
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,927
Martyred lovers look good only in cinema,

770
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,845
in real life they are called assholes.

771
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,889
Fine, then I am an asshole.

772
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,392
-Asshole.
-I am a big asshole. Now what?

773
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,643
You're a bigger asshole.

774
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,290
Hey, asshole.

775
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,255
So, when does she want to elope?

776
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,260
Speak up.

777
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,810
Leave for Ambala tomorrow.

778
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,353
Why Ambala?

779
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,355
It's just too risky out here.

780
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,733
There's a court right next
to the Gurdrawa.

781
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,526
We'll get their marriage registered there.

782
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,863
Shunty has some introduction in Delhi,
he'll come directly.

783
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,616
And your virus Nimmi...

784
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,994
I am sure her father
is keeping a strict watch on her.

785
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,912
How do we get her out?

786
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,300
Hey...

787
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,218
Where?

788
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,139
Hen-party.

789
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,390
What's a hen-party?

790
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,518
Just like boys have a bachelor party
before their wedding.

791
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,811
This one's for the girls.

792
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,147
-Like a bachelors party.
-We don't want any party.

793
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,398
Please, uncle.

794
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,108
-Please, uncle.
-She will go to Ludhiana.

795
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,943
Please, uncle, we won't get
another chance.

796
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,945
If you want to party, then do it here.

797
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,614
No, no, no, uncle, it's not that.

798
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,824
It's a girls party, just us only.

799
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,243
Please, uncle, please, let us go.

800
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,411
-Tanny.
-Yeah?

801
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,329
Go with them.

802
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,414
Tanny? Uncle, what will he do with us?

803
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,665
It's a girls party, yeah, please.

804
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,000
No Tanny, no party.

805
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,668
-Fine.
-Come, Tanny.

806
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,682
Am I going to sit on your lap?

807
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,601
Tanny, let it be.

808
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,686
What will you do amongst girls?

809
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,814
Pick me up in the morning
from Arshi's home.

810
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,690
Papa asked me to keep a watch on you.

811
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,360
You don't trust me either.

812
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,195
Isn't that it?

813
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:56,905
Great.

814
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,616
Papa will screw me over,
try to understand.

815
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,786
I only have two days,
after that I'll go away.

816
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,329
Let me have some fun.

817
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,125
Please, brother. Can't you
do this much for your sister?

818
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,425
I'll pick you up at 7:00 a.m.

819
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,468
Fine.

820
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,679
-Go.
-Thank you.

821
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,763
Go carefully.

822
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,806
Bye.

823
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,816
Bye.

824
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,192
Be careful.

825
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,360
Thanks, thanks.

826
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,488
And, call me as soon as you get there.

827
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,843
Couldn't you park a little further?

828
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,974
But I told you,
I'll be sitting in a red i10 car

829
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,893
outside Avtaar Singh's flourmill.

830
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,521
They all look the same to me in the dark.

831
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,733
-What if someone had seen me?
-But no one did.

832
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,485
Are you waiting for someone
to see me? Let's go.

833
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,987
{\an8}You're with RunningShaadi,

834
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,280
{\an8}I am eloping you.

835
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,533
{\an8}-We are fool-proof.
-Shut up and drive.

836
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,959
Let's get a beer
on the way, stress-buster.

837
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,252
Are you crazy?
We're gonna drink a beer now?

838
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,545
Only crazy people drink beer?

839
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,671
Weird.

840
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,715
Did you run away to get married
or to have fun?

841
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,468
It's not every day
that I run away from home.

842
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,011
Let's enjoy all the way.

843
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,724
-Well, consider it a party from me.
-Great.

844
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,268
We'll reach drunk at the venue
and scare your groom away.

845
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,689
Shunty isn't like you, he's broadminded.

846
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,566
Fine, I am taking you to him.

847
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,250
Did you wash your hands?

848
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,589
Always wash your hands
after peeing, Little.

849
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,800
Learn some good manners.

850
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,765
Rascal.

851
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,517
What are you doing, Ratni?

852
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,019
Slapping your son.

853
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,854
I asked him to keep a watch on her.

854
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,313
How did she run away?

855
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,567
Nothing, the client's demand
is to eat first.

856
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,610
And we cannot refuse the client.

857
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,698
It's the consequence
of taking up a glutton like her.

858
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:27,866
Stop blabbering.

859
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,160
<i>-Is everything set out there?</i>
-Yeah.

860
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,786
Everything's set here,

861
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,664
but your brother-in-love Shunty's phone
is switched off.

862
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,750
He'll get there directly. Keep trying.

863
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,377
<i>And stop stuffing your face </i>
<i>with those fritters.</i>

864
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,881
-How did you know?
-Hang up.

865
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,720
Nimmi, Shunty isn't answering his phone.

866
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,181
He's got his Accounts exam today.

867
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,099
What kind of exam after a job?

868
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,101
Shunty is my senior in college.

869
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,979
And he put up this charade for me.

870
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,565
Meaning?

871
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:06,321
Meaning, I wanted to elope
with you, stupid.

872
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:10,992
You're joking, right?

873
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,787
Fine, I admit my mistake.

874
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,873
I got too carried away
by my college friends.

875
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:17,791
You were right.

876
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,667
But you know how they are?

877
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,879
-Are you mad?
-You lost your mind.

878
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,591
And you fixed your marriage
with that Bihari girl.

879
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,886
As a result, even I made up
a fake story about Shunty.

880
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,846
I thought I'll make you jealous.

881
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,223
I'll go with Shunty.

882
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,225
I had to cancel my date with Shunty.

883
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,935
It's Shunty's birthday.

884
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,856
Tell me something, you think I am crazy

885
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:47,654
to be running around with cards
and pamphlets of your Running Shaadi.

886
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,364
Don't I have better things to do?

887
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,327
I thought I'll spend some time with you.

888
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:58,123
Maybe you'll learn some sense
and cancel your wedding.

889
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,584
But you turned out to be
more stubborn than me.

890
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,089
Well, if I didn't have big ego,
I would've apologized myself.

891
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,590
Then why didn't you?

892
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,219
Why put up this charade?

893
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,429
I did.

894
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,973
-Love marriage.
-With whom?

895
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:15,932
You.

896
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,601
Did you see your reaction?

897
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,353
See your face?

898
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,480
It was a complete turn off.

899
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,067
And I made up that Shunty story.

900
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,610
You've lost your mind?

901
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,323
Why are you being so emotional? Chill.

902
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,993
The plan still remains the same.

903
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,786
We'll go to the Gurdwara and get married.

904
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,079
And then the registry.

905
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,540
All set. Don't worry.

906
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,791
Great, all set.

907
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,710
What a great plan you made.

908
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,717
How will I face uncle?

909
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,928
What about uncle?

910
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,306
He must know by now.

911
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,225
I left a letter before running away.

912
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,439
I wrote "I am running away
with Bharose and getting married."

913
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:16,326
Look, Little, I cannot go back now.

914
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,768
Father is so dumb.

915
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,144
Why will I answer his calls now?

916
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,938
And you're so smart, aren't you?

917
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,314
You couldn't think of a better idea.

918
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,441
I don't understand why
you're getting so emotional.

919
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,235
You should be happy.

920
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,653
I went through so much trouble for you.

921
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,571
Actually, it's bigger than you think.

922
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,240
And the timing is even worse.

923
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,866
It's a feeling.

924
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,117
It doesn't give you a
warning before it comes.

925
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,995
Yeah, great. Only you have
all the feelings, don't you?

926
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,497
Are you even aware of the consequences?

927
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,915
Where are you? I don't care.

928
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,084
Sit at the airport and check
who's coming and going.

929
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,586
The actual root of this mess is Youtube.

930
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,340
Great, man.

931
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,134
Uncle will have to change
the name of his shop,

932
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,136
from Singh 'N' Singh to Singh 'N' Bharose.

933
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,722
Let it be. That's never going to happen.

934
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,100
Your friend is a sissy.

935
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,812
If only my father
was the programmer at ETC Punjabi,

936
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,772
he would've definitely married me.

937
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,108
What's ETC got to do with this?

938
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,110
Shut up!

939
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,073
-You don't get it, do you?
-No, I don't.

940
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,367
I wasn't ready for such a big mess.

941
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,203
I have a commitment in Patna,
you know that.

942
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,871
Fine, go.

943
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,248
Go marry that illiterate Bihari.

944
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,457
She's fit for you.

945
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,750
-Fine.
-Great.

946
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,295
-Fine, go then. Go!
-Fine.

947
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,422
Relax, lovers.

948
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,218
Tell me clearly, do you
guys want to get married or not?

949
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:58,761
The priests are waiting.

950
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,179
No one's getting married.

951
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,683
Call your home now
and tell them everything you did.

952
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,644
Shut your mouth, you fool,
and lower your voice!

953
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,063
I am not calling anyone.

954
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,448
-Hello.
-Hello, mom.

955
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,575
What's all this charade, dear?

956
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,703
-Where are you?
-What difference does it make?

957
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,539
Let's not get into details.
I am coming back.

958
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,709
<i>No, no, no, don't come back right now.</i>

959
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,003
Papa and Tanny are in an awful mood.

960
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,090
<i>I suggest that you two go </i>
<i>to Aunt Neetu's airport manor.</i>

961
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,425
Stay there tonight.

962
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,054
I will try to convince your father.

963
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,101
I'll wait outside.

964
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,337
Nimmi...

965
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:04,971
Nimmi, I...

966
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,558
Best of luck for your commitment, Bharose.

967
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:37,920
Me?

968
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,469
-Where will you go now?
-Home!

969
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,845
Are you crazy?

970
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,307
If anyone spots you in the city,
they will beat you to a pulp.

971
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,895
-You two stay here tonight.
-It's all right, we'll manage.

972
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,023
Hey, management, you've nothing to lose,

973
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,483
but he'll get into deep shit.

974
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,694
Stay here tonight.

975
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,363
-Think of something in the morning.
-I'll tell him.

976
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,747
Let's stay. It's safe here today.

977
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,626
We'll think of something tomorrow morning.

978
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,011
Nimmi, are you okay?

979
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,137
Thank God.

980
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,851
How are you, son?

981
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,394
Come, come in.

982
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,621
Give me the car keys.

983
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,916
I left my moisturizer inside.

984
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:10,012
Like I said, she's the virus in your life.

985
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:16,853
I am leaving here.

986
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,273
What more can I do?

987
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:23,818
Fine.

988
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:30,908
Happy, look.

989
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,371
Run, Bharose, run.

990
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,260
-Nimmi, give me the key.
-What?

991
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,559
Catch him.

992
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:02,773
Come on, hurry!

993
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,610
Keep looking.

994
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,125
There...

995
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,752
Come on, let's go.

996
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,436
Look behind.

997
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,896
I think we left them behind.

998
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,874
-I think we're safe.
-What safe?

999
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,251
I told Nimmi this plan won't work.

1000
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:07,505
Shit!

1001
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,674
I told you don't be a stupid lover.

1002
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,342
We're in big trouble now.

1003
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,302
Nimmi, come out.

1004
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,096
You'll get me killed too.

1005
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,973
She's been shot!

1006
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,018
Nimmi. Nimmi.

1007
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,187
Shit! Get in the car.

1008
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,230
Get in the car, quick.

1009
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,127
Go, go, get the doctor!

1010
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,475
Was it one of those Haryana Roadways bus?

1011
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,605
-Yes.
-They drive pretty rashly.

1012
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,482
Is it serious?

1013
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,860
Some glass pieces
were lodged in the shoulder.

1014
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:15,239
She bled a lot, so she will have
fever for few days.

1015
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,200
How many bullets?

1016
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:24,665
Sorry, man.

1017
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,877
I was worried.

1018
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,756
Try to keep calm.

1019
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,765
Yes. The differential's
been damaged as well.

1020
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,558
Nothing serious.

1021
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:47,772
Tanny.

1022
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,483
Inspector.

1023
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:55,154
Shit, I wonder why they
had to involve the local goon.

1024
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:56,989
Let's get out of here.

1025
01:07:58,282 --> 01:07:59,784
This way, come on.

1026
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,873
Mister.

1027
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:08,626
Nimmi, eat something.
You've to take your medicines.

1028
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,178
There's a bus that leaves
for Dalhousie in ten minutes.

1029
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,514
What to do?

1030
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:49,291
<i>I want to run away with you</i>

1031
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:56,090
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>

1032
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:03,347
<i>The hearts set out on the path of love</i>

1033
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:10,521
<i>O Sun, illuminate my path</i>

1034
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,152
<i>I will patch these bonds</i>
<i>That are separate</i>

1035
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:19,613
<i>You will find me always</i>
<i>Standing behind you</i>

1036
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:26,745
<i>If you feel cold</i>
<i>I'll shield you with my warmth</i>

1037
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:34,545
<i>I feel lost along with you</i>

1038
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:43,095
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>

1039
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:57,735
<i>What dwells in my soul is your love</i>

1040
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:05,284
<i>Like the sun</i>
<i>Sailing in a boat over the river</i>

1041
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:09,914
<i>Don't waste your luminance</i>

1042
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:19,215
<i>Your sorrows are a burden to me</i>

1043
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,137
<i>My heart wants to keep beating for you</i>

1044
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:35,231
<i>I want to run away along with you</i>

1045
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:42,238
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>

1046
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:49,245
<i>The hearts set out on the path of love</i>

1047
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:56,961
<i>O Sun, illuminate my path</i>

1048
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:23,153
<i>The fire that burns in our bodies</i>

1049
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,740
<i>Is also fragrant like love</i>

1050
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:33,580
<i>My tresses are drenched</i>
<i>And the drops are like fire</i>

1051
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:39,628
<i>I can spend a lifetime like this</i>

1052
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:47,886
<i>With you, I feel complete</i>

1053
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:55,352
<i>Even the dust in my hands</i>
<i>Turned to vermillion</i>

1054
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:03,569
<i>I want to run away along with you</i>

1055
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:10,576
<i>I want you to always be in my destiny</i>

1056
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:17,416
<i>The hearts set out on the path of love</i>

1057
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:25,799
<i>O Sun, illuminate my path</i>

1058
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:31,597
<i>I will patch the bonds that have withered</i>

1059
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,728
Where are your manners?

1060
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,813
Sorry for disturbing your activities.

1061
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:43,359
But I just saw Raje mama
and his gang in the market.

1062
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,903
He was showing your photos
in every shop and inquiring.

1063
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,284
Sorry, man.

1064
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:53,994
I...

1065
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:00,709
I uploaded pictures
of Dalhousie on Facebook.

1066
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,587
Sorry.

1067
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,508
Now, we'll have to run from here too.

1068
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:10,135
How long will I keep
running with my Nimmi?

1069
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,389
My Nimmi.

1070
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:17,226
Rascal, you're marrying one

1071
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,436
and running away with another.

1072
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,355
What do you want?

1073
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,650
Right now, I want everyone's safety.

1074
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,949
We can get safety in Laloo's country.

1075
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,701
-Patna?
-Yeah.

1076
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,370
It's a stupid idea.

1077
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,415
You know his wedding's been fixed.

1078
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,833
But that's his area.

1079
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,252
No one can touch him out there.

1080
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:44,920
That's a fact.

1081
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,220
And will you take me there
as your wedding guest?

1082
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:58,725
Nimmi...

1083
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,606
I... I'll think of something.

1084
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,346
Stop, stop, stop here.

1085
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,806
Uncle.

1086
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,685
Bharose.

1087
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,313
-How are you?
-Just fine.

1088
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,772
You were supposed to come after a week.

1089
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:46,899
You could've at least informed me.

1090
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:47,858
Doesn't matter.

1091
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:49,568
Mukundi would've
picked you from the station.

1092
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,362
Well, I wrapped up work soon,
so I came early.

1093
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,323
Nimmi. Cyber. She's Cyber's sister.

1094
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:56,909
-Brother and sister?
-Yes.

1095
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,452
Very nice.

1096
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,330
-I am heading to the studio?
-Are you shooting something?

1097
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,457
I am making an ad for phenyl.

1098
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,626
Cockroach Clean Phenyl.

1099
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,961
Fine, uncle, you leave, we'll take a nap.

1100
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,379
See you in the evening.

1101
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,672
Why evening?

1102
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,633
Come in the afternoon,
we'll have lunch together.

1103
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:15,511
-Fine, then I'll freshen up.
-Take a bath?

1104
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:16,803
No, no, no, it's okay.

1105
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,764
Of course we will, we'll take a bath.

1106
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,599
It was a long journey, we'll take a bath.
Isn't there any water?

1107
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:21,767
Of course there's water.

1108
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,185
The geyser's working too.

1109
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,562
But it blows up after 10-12 minutes.

1110
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:29,525
Fill up a bucket and use that for bathing.

1111
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,734
Uncle, you're just...

1112
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:32,986
I am waiting there, okay?

1113
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,571
Nice.

1114
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,866
Get some rest, enjoy.

1115
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,910
Should I give it a push?

1116
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:41,537
-Push?
-Yes.

1117
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,247
You're still hogging this piece of junk.

1118
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,456
Why don't you buy a new one?

1119
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,917
I will, this is just for now.

1120
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,586
I just fueled her up.

1121
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:50,963
It's runs really smooth.

1122
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,590
Just watch it sail smoothly.

1123
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:57,511
Yes... yes... yes...

1124
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:02,432
Bravo...

1125
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:06,687
Bharose... thank you.

1126
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,529
Ujala Babu.

1127
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,366
Ujala Babu.

1128
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,702
Who could that be at this early hour?

1129
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,371
It's so dark in Ujala Babu's house.

1130
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,331
Ujala Babu.

1131
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,208
Ujala Babu.

1132
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:30,836
Ujala Babu.

1133
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:33,714
Ujala Babu.

1134
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:34,840
Brother-in-law.

1135
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,428
Oh, my God. I can't believe.

1136
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:40,971
Brother-in-law, when did you arrive?

1137
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,889
You were supposed to come after four days.

1138
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,351
-Well, work finished early, so...
-But, this is not done.

1139
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:51,064
We would've come to pick you up,
with special arrangements.

1140
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,483
Sit, sit. Calm down.

1141
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:56,403
-How about some water?
-This is bad.

1142
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:57,613
You should've informed me before.

1143
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,907
-Water?
-Yes, yes, water. Give me some water.

1144
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,493
I can't believe it.

1145
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,168
Nimmi, stay inside.

1146
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,803
-Water?
-Yes.

1147
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,265
Who is the lady?

1148
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,937
She's my friend's sister,
here to attend my wedding.

1149
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,773
-Any problem?
-No, no.

1150
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:33,899
-Any objection?
-No.

1151
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,484
My friends can attend my wedding,
can't they?

1152
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,277
What's to object?

1153
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:42,240
I'm just see a new face,
that's why I am telling you. No big deal.

1154
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,744
I came to tell you, that the DJ...

1155
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,704
-Mithilesh?
-Yeah, Mithilesh...

1156
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:49,998
He's just awesome.

1157
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,085
When he plays his music,
even the dead start dancing.

1158
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,795
-That's how good he is.
-Is he?

1159
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,129
Yeah.

1160
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,923
I'll get you something to eat, wait.

1161
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,551
I won't eat.

1162
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:06,264
I want you, your family.
along with your friends

1163
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,725
to come over for a meal.

1164
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,269
Why friends? It's a family matter.
We'll come.

1165
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,021
Your friends will come,
we'll get to know each other.

1166
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,398
We'll maintain a relation with her.

1167
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:18,235
If uncle finds out,
he'll say why I didn't invite them too.

1168
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:19,611
-Okay?
-Okay, I get it.

1169
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,655
-I'll get them too.
-You get it.

1170
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,906
Can I leave now?

1171
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:25,492
-With your permission?
-Of course.

1172
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,577
Okay. I am so happy to see you.

1173
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,537
Great.

1174
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,663
Do come.

1175
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:31,081
-Okay.
-See you.

1176
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,796
Savita, when I say action
pour a capful in the bucket.

1177
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:39,589
This phenyl company,

1178
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:43,093
hasn't paid me
for my last four ad campaigns.

1179
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:46,221
His phenyl isn't selling
and he blames my ads for it.

1180
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:48,306
But that's not my fault.

1181
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,933
Back home you would
drink even ground water

1182
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:51,393
and out here you want mineral water.

1183
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:52,769
Go sit in the cow-shed.

1184
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,688
What's your scene with that girl?

1185
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,233
-What girl?
-That girl who came here with you.

1186
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:01,403
-Nothing.
-Did you two do it already?

1187
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,448
-What are you saying, uncle? Why would--
-No, even if you did, just leave her.

1188
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,699
I don't know you.

1189
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,743
Mistakes happen.

1190
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,954
Soon you'll get married, son. Right?

1191
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,581
Take care.

1192
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,084
Uncle...

1193
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:20,255
I have submitted a pilot episode
in DD Patna.

1194
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,007
Now it's in Sinha sir's hands.

1195
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,678
But you're in my hand, aren't you?

1196
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:32,017
Your aunt has made
a heavy investment for the Pilot.

1197
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:33,727
Look at that, you're piling on weight.

1198
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,312
You won't be able to work properly.

1199
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:36,813
Look at your aunt.

1200
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:42,611
How she's cutting corners
on the Unit member's lunch.

1201
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,112
You two are brothers, right.

1202
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,157
Eat together, come on.

1203
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,992
Uncle... I...

1204
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:56,750
-I have a doubt about Neha.
-What?

1205
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,084
What doubt?

1206
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:03,173
She is a very beautiful, gentle lady.

1207
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,926
I knew it right away,

1208
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,094
that she is made for you.

1209
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,513
Only.

1210
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,141
Think only about Neha,

1211
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,937
otherwise the entire family
will be out on the street.

1212
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:19,731
I beg you.

1213
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:25,111
How are you?

1214
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,196
Yeah, I'm fine.

1215
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,323
Swine.

1216
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,326
Never pays on time.

1217
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,037
Just act smart.

1218
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,622
See the guy in the black coat?

1219
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:38,375
I am sure he alone drinks up
all of the phenyl.

1220
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,043
Nothing must be left for the company.

1221
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,586
I'll go meet the swine.

1222
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,213
Yes, I'm coming.

1223
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,507
You wait here till then, I'll be back.

1224
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,050
Have your tea.

1225
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,511
Yeah, sir, I am waiting for you.

1226
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,264
You're looking a little weak.

1227
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,641
You didn't tell your uncle, yet.

1228
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,935
Speak softly, he'll hear you.

1229
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,521
It's a very complicated matter.

1230
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:02,482
Muktiyar, this will go in
"the Very Big Mess" package.

1231
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,901
Are you taking me along
to be a part of your happiness?

1232
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:08,989
Try to understand.

1233
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:12,075
If you don't come, they will
ask me couple of more questions.

1234
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:13,368
Let's go, please.

1235
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:16,121
Tell you what, you pay for everything now.

1236
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,373
We'll settle the accounts
when we get back.

1237
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:19,541
Do what you want?

1238
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,794
Just don't go get married to that girl.

1239
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,380
Next, you'll see me
dancing in your wedding.

1240
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,384
Is she coming along... that girl,
Nimmi and that boy, her brother?

1241
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,261
Why are you so interested?

1242
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:32,679
I am not.

1243
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:36,182
The more the people,
the better the impression.

1244
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,727
Let's cheers. Come on.

1245
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,775
Now that way, this way.

1246
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,027
You're gonna bump someone.

1247
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,862
I am driving an ambassador,
it's not a joke.

1248
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,739
Left...

1249
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:52,782
-Two-two-two-two...
-What's two-two-two-two.

1250
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:57,287
If you would have played
you would have lost two kilos.

1251
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,291
Turn this way, this way.

1252
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,792
I have had enough of you.

1253
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,961
Why should I turn that way?
I'll follow the road.

1254
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:07,631
You guys should stand aside.

1255
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:10,008
You see, he's not too good
with the steering.

1256
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,260
-Is he driving himself?
-He's already been in three accidents.

1257
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:15,347
He broke the Doordarshan wall.
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

1258
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,767
Bantu... Bantu, put a brick under the car.

1259
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:22,604
-Prakash, you're so naughty.
-Come, come.

1260
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,648
I am naughty.

1261
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,858
Put a brick under it.

1262
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,402
-How are you?
-Great.

1263
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:31,655
Just great.

1264
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:33,823
Come, welcome.

1265
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,242
Come in.

1266
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,286
Hello, Nimmi.

1267
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,454
Come in, please.

1268
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:42,207
Nimmi, help yourself with the sweets.

1269
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,626
Nimmi, it's special sweet, please.

1270
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,294
Slowly.

1271
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,754
Now that's called love.

1272
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:49,547
He's my nephew,

1273
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,299
but I have always treated him like a son.

1274
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,926
After all, he's my sister's son.

1275
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:53,969
Great.

1276
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,221
Well, I think the boy
and girl should meet now.

1277
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,598
Dear, if she's finished decking up,
then call her out.

1278
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,352
-Look, here she is.
-There she is.

1279
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,437
-She's here.
-Very nice.

1280
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:07,190
Seems like an angel
descending from heaven.

1281
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:09,275
Take blessings, dear. Go on.

1282
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,444
-Take your shoes off.
-It's all right.

1283
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,654
-Bless you, dear.
-Take your shoes off.

1284
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:14,739
-Bless her properly.
-It's done.

1285
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,241
We're modern people,
we don't believe in these things.

1286
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,325
They are modern too.

1287
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,868
Let Neha sit there.

1288
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,996
Sitting there like an ox.

1289
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:24,249
-Whose son is that?
-I told you, he's...

1290
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,292
-It's their family matter.
-There's a history behind it.

1291
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:27,836
I'll tell you some other time.

1292
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,714
You're being shy, how does she look?

1293
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,090
It's their first marriage, after all.

1294
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,800
Just beautiful. Who chose her after all?

1295
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:34,884
She's my choice.

1296
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,846
-And Neha sings so well.
-Yeah.

1297
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:39,764
She sings almost like a nightingale.

1298
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,558
Come on, sing a song.

1299
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:43,893
What would you prefer?

1300
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:47,439
-Classical, folk, western--
-Modern.

1301
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:48,898
-Sing a modern song, dear.
-Yes.

1302
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,775
Dear, sing a modern song for them.

1303
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:52,485
Artists always need freedom.

1304
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:53,737
Artists always need freedom.

1305
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,238
Go ahead, sing.

1306
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:56,197
Sing.

1307
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,491
I'll play and you sing.

1308
01:23:58,575 --> 01:23:59,701
Come on, start.

1309
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:03,163
<i>One-two-three-four</i>
<i>Get on the dance floor</i>

1310
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:04,622
<i>Bum-shake... Bum-shake</i>

1311
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,963
<i>Gilli-gilli-gilli-gilli dumbo</i>

1312
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,216
Clap.

1313
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,510
Great, wonderful.

1314
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,095
-So, she's done?
-Yeah.

1315
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:22,849
Let Neha and Bharose
get to know each other.

1316
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:24,309
Let them talk.

1317
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,810
Just talk.

1318
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,771
Go on, go on...

1319
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,773
There's a big garden up ahead.

1320
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,232
Just go take a look.

1321
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:32,734
Go on, son.

1322
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,027
He's a bit shy.

1323
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,570
Go, talk openly about everything.

1324
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:36,738
Tell him about your education too.

1325
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,657
-Send two cups of tea for the children.
-Yes.

1326
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:43,495

<i>Bum-shake... Bum-shake</i>

1328
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,292
Neha's so talented, isn't she?

1329
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,002
I am really confused.

1330
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:53,171
Is she better or her?

1331
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,507
Even I am confused,

1332
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:57,884
should I slap you, or give you a whack?

1333
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:00,512
You're jealous, that's all.

1334
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:03,139
I am not jealous at all.

1335
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,975
You guys don't know anything.

1336
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:07,727
Did you see her face?

1337
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:09,437
She was sad.

1338
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:13,024
She's right, something's wrong.

1339
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,528
That Sinha looks over-exited

1340
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,613
and his daughter doesn't even talk to me.

1341
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:19,781
See.

1342
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,244
Let's investigate this case.

1343
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:26,621
Let's find out everything,

1344
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:30,959
like where she goes,
when and who she goes out with.

1345
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,128

Gone.

1354
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,180
She will take at least a couple of hours.

1355
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:26,598
She takes so long.

1356
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:28,141
She needs it.

1357
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:30,685
How about a cup of tea? Come.

1358
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,647
At least her brothers
aren't standing guard anymore.

1359

-Yeah.

01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,197
Rascal...

1401
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,699
-My future wife.
-Wait!

1402
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,326
Wait, don't scare him.

1403
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:34,619
Don't scare him.

1404
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:36,913
Do you love her or not? Tell me.

1405
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,540
-I do, a little.
-What? Little...

1406
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,667
-No, no!
-Little...

1407
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,711
You love her a little?

1408
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,171
I love her a lot.

1409
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:47,173
That's exactly why
I went to see her one last time.

1410
01:29:47,256 --> 01:29:50,885
-Will you marry her?
-How can I marry your future wife?

1411
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:53,012
We're not asking, we're telling you.

1412
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:54,430
You're going to marry her.

1413
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:55,598
Don't worry, come on.

1414
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:58,559
Don't worry, I said I won't hit you. Come.

1415
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,186
What's your name? Tell me your name?

1416
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,813
You're sweating. Wipe your sweat.

1417
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,564
-Amit Kumar.
-Look, Amit Kumar.

1418
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,650
She's a nice girl, marry her.

1419
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,904
-That's fine, but, Neha's father...
-Yeah?

1420
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:13,825
That old man has taken her phone,
internet connection, Twitter, everything.

1421
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,076
How will I get there?

1422
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,911
Don't worry, I am there.

1423
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,412
I'll arrange everything.

1424
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:19,580
Are you crazy?

1425
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:22,917
Why take the risk of eloping her
from her wedding?

1426
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:24,544
Let's do it before that.

1427
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:25,962
You don't get it, don't you?

1428
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:27,880
If the wedding procession doesn't
get there, uncle will be ruined.

1429
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,340
His serial will be scrapped.

1430
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:32,510
Why are you so concerned
about your uncle's serial?

1431
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,929
What about our life that's
turned into a daily soap?

1432
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,889
When I was a kid, I had no parents,
uncle was everything for me.

1433
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:38,724
He always stood behind me.

1434
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:41,561
And now that he needs me,
I must stand with him.

1435
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:42,728
I will have to help him.

1436
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:44,313
I can't just leave him alone.

1437
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,067
And Neha...

1438
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:55,533
Nimmi, we'll need your help. Understood?

1439
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,536
<i>Go to Neha Sinha's home tomorrow morning.</i>

1440
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:00,371
<i>It's her 18th birthday.</i>

1441
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,207
<i>Go meet her under the pretext </i>
<i>of wishing her</i>

1442
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,750
<i>and show her Amit Kumar's video.</i>

1443
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:09,297
<i>Convince her that sissy</i>
<i>is ready to marry her.</i>

1444
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:11,465
<i>Okay?</i>

1445
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:12,884
<i>And at any cost...</i>

1446
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:16,512
<i>And at any cost,</i>
<i>convince her for our plan.</i>

1447
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:21,601
When the wedding procession leave,
you and Amit Kumar will disappear.

1448
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,813
You two must get there
before we do with the guests.

1449
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:29,942
<i>Neha Sinha will be waiting for you in </i>
<i>one of the rooms in Pataliputra Heritage.</i>

1450
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:32,153
<i>Pick her up from there.</i>

1451
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:35,114
<i>I'll hire a white ambassador</i>
<i>and tell him to park downstairs.</i>

1452
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:36,782
Take the taxi to Bodh Gaya,

1453
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:40,870
<i>where Dadua will get you</i>
<i>two married and get it registered.</i>

1454
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:43,414
And when we arrive with the guests,

1455
01:31:43,497 --> 01:31:45,041
things would've already gone awry.

1456
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:48,794
After Neha Sinha disappears,
Sinha will be embarrassed.

1457
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:51,005
Okay? He'll quietly approve the serial.

1458
01:31:51,088 --> 01:31:52,381
Uncle will be happy too,
everything will be fine.

1459
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:54,258
And anyway,
it's only for a couple of months.

1460
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,261
Sinha and Family
will finally accept Amit Kumar.

1461
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:01,307
-Just like Milky-Shonku case.
-Wow, Little, proud of you.

1462
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:02,266
What a plan.

1463
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,060
Here... have a peanut.

1464
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,021
-Mithilesh?
-Yes.

1465
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:08,439
Uncle, I have finished
all the arrangements.

1466
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:10,358
-Everything is okay.
-Okay.

1467
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:12,109
It's going to play,
it will blow everyone out.

1468
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:14,654
Look here, I have finished
all the lighting as well.

1469
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:17,448
Take a look, see, it looks so beautiful.

1470
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:21,786
What happened?

1471
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:23,120
No connection.

1472
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,797
So after all you made me
a guest in your wedding.

1473
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:36,550
-Shall we?
-Come.

1474
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:37,927
Let's deal with this.

1475
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:58,990
<i>I am your better and you're my best</i>

1476
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:05,621
<i>You're my bird and I am your nest</i>

1477
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:11,627
<i>So why do you keep taking my love's test?</i>

1478
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:18,843
<i>I don't keep taking your love's test</i>

1479
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:20,511
<i>Get it</i>

1480
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:23,222
See...

1481
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:25,850
RunningShaadi's made such
a grand arrangement for your wedding.

1482
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:27,310
Get in the feeling.

1483
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:34,317
<i>You're my east, you're my west</i>

1484
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:41,032
<i>You're my prayer and you're my request</i>

1485
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:47,705
<i>You're my ludo, I am your chess</i>

1486
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:54,754
<i>You look like new and I'm so fresh</i>

1487
01:33:55,129 --> 01:34:00,968
<i>So why do you keep taking my love's test?</i>

1488
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:07,808
<i>I don't keep taking your love's test</i>

1489
01:34:38,672 --> 01:34:39,840
Nimmi!

1490
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:47,515
Something's not right, Little.

1491
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,517
Yeah, even I don't understand
what's going on here.

1492
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,227
Everyone looks happy.

1493
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:54,438
You know what, go inside
and check whether Neha ran away or not.

1494
01:34:54,563 --> 01:34:55,564
Go. Call Cyber.

1495
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,149
-Call Cyber.
-Yes.

1496
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:59,110
Quickly. go on.

1497
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:01,654
I wonder what happened?

1498
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:07,410
Uncle? Uncle? Uncle?

1499
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:12,415
Uncle?

1500
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,834
Uncle, why's everyone so excited?
Is everything all right?

1501
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:16,210
It's their daughter's wedding, after all.

1502
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:18,754
-They are bound to be excited.
-Right.

1503
01:35:21,173 --> 01:35:26,220
Mr. Sinha is giving 5,100 and a really
cozy blanket as a welcome gift.

1504
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:34,395
Unbelievable!

1505
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:47,116
Seems like uncle just robbed an ATM.

1506
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,618
Yeah. But only 20 rupee notes.

1507
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,205
Garland, garland.

1508
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:55,499
-Ujala.
-Two hearts uniting.

1509
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,543
Uncle, you too.

1510
01:35:58,752 --> 01:36:00,171
Take this garland.

1511
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,508
-Blanket, give me the blanket.
-Blanket.

1512
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,135
Here's the blanket.

1513
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:09,346
-Why spend so much?
-It's done now.

1514
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,812
Come, come, come, sit.

1515
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,983
A bit more ahead.

1516
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:22,359
Photographer?

1517
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,527
We've paid him in full.

1518
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:24,487
Look here.

1519
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,739
Look here, look here.

1520
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:30,826
You too, come.

1521
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:33,287
Let the children sit closer.

1522
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,997
Look here, children.

1523
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,124
-Smile.
-What's going on?

1524
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:38,876
Thank you.

1525
01:36:40,836 --> 01:36:41,879
Nimmi, what happened?

1526
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,173
Neha is still in her room,
she didn't run away.

1527
01:36:44,798 --> 01:36:46,175
-What?
-What now?

1528
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,220
Did you talk to Cyberjeet?

1529
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:54,141
Some girl keeps calling
continuously on your number.

1530
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,854
One of my constables was doing his duty,

1531
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:03,025
but he bribed him with
50 rupees and said share it.

1532
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:07,863
Firstly, he was driving that
antique piece, without any papers

1533
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:09,490
or driving license either.

1534
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:10,824
And then bribery.

1535
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:12,660
I had to push that heap of junk
all the way to the station.

1536
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:18,123
-Well, what's plan B?
-Nimmi, plan A never failed.

1537
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:19,833
So we never had plan B.

1538
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:25,130
Do this, go tell your uncle everything.

1539
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:26,924
And tell him to forget
all about his TV serial.

1540
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:28,884
What are you saying, Nimmi?
How can I do such a thing?

1541
01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:31,262
My uncle and his company will be ruined.

1542
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,222
You'll have to do something, Nimmi.

1543
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:59,832
You're stepping into your new life now.

1544
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,668
-Life isn't easy after...
-Neha!

1545
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:07,131
-What have you done to her?
-What happened?

1546
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:08,424
What happened, madam?

1547
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:10,551
-Are you the beautician?
-Yes, I am.

1548
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,177
What kind of makeup is this?

1549
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:14,471
-What is this hairstyle?
-It's fine.

1550
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:17,182
-Is this how she's going to get married?
-I chose this hairstyle from a magazine.

1551
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:18,809
It's really awful.

1552
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:21,061
Sister, I have been trying
to tell her since morning,

1553
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:22,563
that it's an awful hairstyle,
but she doesn't listen.

1554
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:25,149
She just finished doing your makeup.

1555
01:38:25,357 --> 01:38:27,192
-How can you tell her since morning?
-Brother,

1556
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:28,402
please don't interfere in female matters.

1557
01:38:28,485 --> 01:38:31,488
-Listen to me--
-Nimmi, listen to me.

1558
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:34,450
Everyone's waiting out there,
we're losing precious time.

1559
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:37,119
Her photo and video,
everything will be ruined.

1560
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:38,495
I'll fix it.

1561
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,080
-I'll be back soon, don't worry. Okay.
-Oh, God--

1562
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,458
-Please go, please.
-Listen--

1563
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,876
-Go.
-Stop pushing--

1564
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:46,462
It's her wedding,
what have you done to her?

1565
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:49,214
-I kept telling her that, but--
-We don't have time.

1566
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:50,883
You did what you had to do.

1567
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:53,177
But everyone's waiting.

1568
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,720
Stay here, I'll be right back.

1569
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:56,680
Everyone's waiting.

1570
01:38:56,930 --> 01:38:57,890
Unbelievable.

1571
01:38:58,182 --> 01:38:59,141
Sister...

1572
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:04,772
Tell me something,
why did they shift you to the third floor?

1573
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:07,608
There was some
electricity problem out there.

1574
01:39:08,984 --> 01:39:10,694
Sister, think of something.

1575
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:13,280
-How do I get you out of here?
-Think, think, think...

1576
01:39:13,947 --> 01:39:16,617
It took me four hours to do her makeup.

1577
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,286
I know you did, you're an artist.

1578
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,954
I can see that in your eyes.

1579
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:24,792
Are you thinking of something?

1580
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:29,296
Come here. Climb up.

1581
01:39:31,173 --> 01:39:33,884
Look... walk on these bricks, till there.

1582
01:39:33,967 --> 01:39:36,553
Then jump down from there.

1583
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:39,723
I'll bring a ladder
and help you climb down.

1584
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:41,183
What if I fall down?

1585
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:42,726
You will only break your back.

1586
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,269
But if you get married to Bharose?

1587
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:46,980
-Eat some...
-No, no...

1588
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:48,399
-Come on, you'll feel better.
-I don't want to eat.

1589
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:50,192
I apologise on her behalf.

1590
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:53,278
-You know what, just do as I say.
-Yes.

1591
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:54,738
-Go get some sweets.
-Yes.

1592
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:55,948
-And ice-cream.
-Yes.

1593
01:39:56,031 --> 01:39:58,367
-Keep the tools down. Keep it.
-Now go, and hurry up.

1594
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:06,125
Sister, I am scared.

1595
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:09,336
-Come on, one, two, three.
-No, hail Goddess.

1596
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,337
Fine, that too.

1597
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:11,630
Quickly.

1598
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:14,425
Don't waste time, or I'll push you.

1599
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,093
Wait, wait, wait, sister.

1600
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:18,804
-Hail Goddess.
-Yes.

1601
01:40:18,887 --> 01:40:20,723
Fine, I am doing it.

1602
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:23,892
Careful, see you downstairs.

1603
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:27,438
Here, eat it.

1604
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:28,856
Eat... please.

1605
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:30,649
See...

1606
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,486
-Are you guys done?
-What done?

1607
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:37,072
I mean, If you guys are done setting,
let her hair set in.

1608
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,658
Don't disturb her for 10-15 minutes.

1609
01:40:40,033 --> 01:40:41,618
Why won't we, why not disturb...

1610
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,579
Don't disturb her.

1611
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:48,375
You act like you're the queen
or something.

1612
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:50,127
You play with someone's sentiments.

1613
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,170
Just too much.

1614
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:52,713
-Let it be, let it be.
-I...

1615
01:40:52,796 --> 01:40:55,591
She will make her look like a movie-star,
I would like to watch too.

1616
01:40:58,135 --> 01:40:59,678
Hail Goddess!

1617
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:05,142
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1618
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:08,645
Save me! Save me!

1619
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:12,900
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1620
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:18,280
Hail Goddess!

1621
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,535
-Where's the back gate?
-There?

1622
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:24,787
Thank you.

1623
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:30,334
Hey, is your name Ramkhilavan?

1624
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:32,461
Why are you sleeping? Get up!

1625
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:02,407
Didn't I tell you?
She's looking really beautiful.

1626
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:19,109
Priest...

1627
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:22,195
I must go to the bathroom.

1628
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:26,450
Of course, you can go,
but after completing the nuptial rounds.

1629
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:27,993
But I must go now.

1630
01:43:28,076 --> 01:43:30,078
Hold it for a minute, it's almost done.

1631
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:33,749
Breathe easy.
Concentrate on your belly button.

1632
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:34,708
Hello...

1633
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:37,711
-He's busy on the phone, I must go...
-You can't get up like this.

1634
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:39,463
He's busy on the phone, see.

1635
01:43:39,963 --> 01:43:41,673
I'll throw that phone in the fire.

1636
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:44,801
Nonsense.

1637
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:45,969
Listen, brother-in-law.

1638
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:49,973
Bloody Cyber. Why isn't he answering
the phone? Bloody fool.

1639
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:00,275
Get done with it...

1640
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,405
What the...

1641
01:44:06,573 --> 01:44:08,617
What can I do if he has to pee?

1642
01:44:09,993 --> 01:44:11,370
It's almost time.

1643
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:22,547
Now start...

1644
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:24,091
Come on, you're delaying everything.

1645
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,305
What are you two whispering?

1646
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,437
-What happened?
-What happened to the light?

1647
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:39,314
Curse you.

1648
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:40,899
Must be a blown fuse.

1649
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,109
No electricity.

1650
01:44:42,192 --> 01:44:44,820
What kind of arrangement is this?

1651
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:46,863
Find out.

1652
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:48,407
Where's the generator guy?

1653
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:49,992
What insolence is this?

1654
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:51,576
What arrangement is this?

1655
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,370
Calm down, please.

1656
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:54,913
Buntu, go check.

1657
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:22,816
Sinha sir...

1658
01:45:24,234 --> 01:45:28,864
you knew your daughter had an affair,

1659
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:36,788
yet, you were so hasty
in getting her married to my son.

1660
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,166
What are you saying, Ujala?

1661
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:42,627
Youngsters always do such thing
before marriage--

1662
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:43,962
What nonsense!

1663
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:47,549
The last time I felt this bad was
when Laloo sir was jailed.

1664
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,218
No need to worry. Prasad, what happened?

1665
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:52,012
I spoke with them, we'll know really soon.

1666
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,764
I spoke with the CA... the PA...

1667
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:56,600
-Yes, we'll know in ten minutes.
-Ten minutes.

1668
01:45:56,683 --> 01:46:01,855
Not a single train will leave
Patna station without my permission.

1669
01:46:01,938 --> 01:46:03,482
-Listen--
-Brother-in-law!

1670
01:46:03,565 --> 01:46:05,317
-Listen, don't call me brother-in-law.
-Please...

1671
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,902
-Your daughter ran away.
-Yes.

1672
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:08,987
-Get it.
-Uncle, let me make it clear.

1673
01:46:09,154 --> 01:46:11,865
I won't marry a runaway bride.
It's a matter of my reputation.

1674
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:14,868
Listen, do one thing, return his serial.

1675
01:46:14,951 --> 01:46:17,370
We don't want any kind
of relation with such people.

1676
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:18,914
How can we return the contract?

1677
01:46:18,997 --> 01:46:19,915
We don't want your favor.

1678
01:46:19,998 --> 01:46:23,460
-What favor? I trust Shanti Productions.
-Yes.

1679
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:25,337
Why drag the serial in all this?

1680
01:46:25,587 --> 01:46:28,298
And anyway I already signed
the contract in the morning.

1681
01:46:28,381 --> 01:46:30,509
It's already been passed.

1682
01:46:30,759 --> 01:46:33,762
Look, it's our mistake,
my daughter ran away.

1683
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,306
Forgive us.

1684
01:46:37,099 --> 01:46:38,141
Look, son.

1685
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:43,105
He's the girl's father after all
and he's trying to atone.

1686
01:46:43,188 --> 01:46:44,189
Get it.

1687
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:48,860
Sit down everyone...
and tell the MLA to stay in ICU.

1688
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:49,903
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

1689
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:50,862
Tell him, tell him.

1690
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:53,406
Now get some rest,
and get some tea for my son.

1691
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,826
Get some tea... some ginger tea...

1692
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:57,661
-Cardamom too.
-Cardamom tea.

1693
01:46:57,744 --> 01:47:00,163
I have a headache from wearing
that headgear for so long.

1694
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:01,790
-It's possible.
-Massage his head.

1695
01:47:01,873 --> 01:47:04,376
Get some tea, spiced tea.

1696
01:47:15,303 --> 01:47:16,805
Cyberjeet Singh.

1697
01:47:16,888 --> 01:47:19,266
First time in the history
of RunningShaadi you failed me.

1698
01:47:19,641 --> 01:47:20,976
All because you tried
to be over smart with a cop.

1699
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:22,227
He showed you, didn't he?

1700
01:47:22,894 --> 01:47:24,771
Thank God I ran into Shonku.

1701
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:32,028
Brother, glad to meet you.

1702
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:35,323
So the guy,
getting married outside, is you.

1703
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:36,491
Forget it.

1704
01:47:36,616 --> 01:47:37,826
What are you doing here?

1705
01:47:38,076 --> 01:47:40,829
Basically, I have come for a...
you know, conference.

1706
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:42,372
Can you do me a favor?

1707
01:47:42,455 --> 01:47:44,332
I can lay down my life,
without any condition.

1708
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:45,584
Tell me what to do.

1709
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,682
You're not needed anymore...

1710
01:48:00,765 --> 01:48:01,766
And what's funny is,

1711
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:06,605
Sinha uncle, he's searching
all over the city for his daughter.

1712
01:48:06,688 --> 01:48:07,814
Searching, searching...

1713
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,566
But his daughter is right here.

1714
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:13,486
All that's fine,
but what's the plan ahead.

1715
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:14,821
Plan remains the same.

1716
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:17,032
We'll call a taxi

1717
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:20,160
and you two go straight to Bodh Gaya.

1718
01:48:21,077 --> 01:48:22,120
And you two?

1719
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,339
Beyond this is outside my coverage area.

1720
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:15,966
You got to handle it.

1721
01:49:17,592 --> 01:49:19,386
If you make it out alive,
then come see me in the evening.

1722
01:49:19,469 --> 01:49:20,929
We've a meeting with Muktiyar.

1723
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:22,472
I remember.

1724
01:49:23,848 --> 01:49:24,891
Hey antivirus,

1725
01:49:26,851 --> 01:49:28,144
don't take it too seriously.

1726
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:29,896
Thanks.

1727
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:33,608
No virus.

1728
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,863
Well, see you then. Take care.

1729
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:55,588
<i>Bars... that don't break</i>

1730
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:58,258
Think again... I say it's a bad idea.

1731
01:49:58,341 --> 01:50:00,552
<i>Love breaks it all</i>

1732
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:02,345
Nimmi, I am tired of eloping with you.

1733
01:50:02,804 --> 01:50:06,808
Now that we're here, let's deal with it.

1734
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:14,065
Nimmi.

1735
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:16,901
That double barrel
which hangs on uncle's wall.

1736
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:18,653
Does it work?

1737
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:21,489
Papa would clean it every Sunday.

1738
01:50:22,407 --> 01:50:23,616
I guess it works then.

1739
01:50:23,825 --> 01:50:26,494
Doesn't matter, uncle is a big miser.
