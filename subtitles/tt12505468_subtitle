14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
why don't you call and tell them?

15
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,680
Why are you bothering me?

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,320
I've placed such a big order..

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,160
Thank you..
Yes, tell me

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,480
- I wanted to talk to you..
- I'm listening..

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,600
- Not like this.. can't we sit and talk?
- Don't waste my time.. Who are you?

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,280
- My name is Raghav..
- Raghav?

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,000
Raghav..

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,120
Have we met before?

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,080
No.. but you kind of know me.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,320
I am your blood relation

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,840
How are we related by blood?

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,960
Raghav doesn't ring a bell?

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,240
I am Chhaya's husband.

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
That might be a better
introduction for you

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,560
Now can we talk?

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,720
What do you want to talk about?

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Do you want to do it here?
It might be better inside..

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
Please come in

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
Thank you

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,440
I've been wanting to
meet you for some time..

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,600
But something or the
other comes up..

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,960
Some office chore or the other

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,760
Domestic life..

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
.. and its problems

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,040
Its never easy..

40
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,400
How long have you been married?

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,480
Eight.. eight years

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,960
Your wife is not at home?

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,880
She has gone out.
But she'll be back any minute, so..

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,600
I wont take too much of your time

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,000
Actually I just came
to see you out of curiousity

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,120
If your wife..

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,760
How to put it delicately,
likes somebody..

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,920
one gets curious- who is this guy,
what does he look like?

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,360
Please don't fret- shit happens but
we are grown ups, we can deal with it

50
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
I haven't come here to fight with you

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,960
I have just come to
make peace with myself..

52
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,040
Nothing else

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,640
Raghav..

54
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,240
I really don't know
what to say to you..

55
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll tell you what to say.

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,320
You should ask me if I want some tea.
I'd say, 'yes', and then we'll have some tea

57
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,400
- Tea?
- Tea..

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,280
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes please

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
Sure.. Just give me a minute

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Sure...

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,080
Just wait...

62
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,920
Let me tell you something about me.

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,240
I am a very philosophical man..
spiritual

64
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
Anger, jealousy..

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,000
..these are all negative emotions-
worthless.

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,800
I have denounced them.

67
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
Careful, its hot..

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,560
Have you read this book?

69
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,920
No, not yet..

70
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,000
You must. Its a good one..

71
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Nice tea

72
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
From Assam..
Its' supposed to be very calming

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,040
How long have you been at it?

74
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,640
6- 7 months

75
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,640
6 or 7?

76
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
- In the beginning, it wasn't..
- serious..

77
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,440
When did it get really serious?

78
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
About 4 months..

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,160
July

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,920
We had just returned
from our vacation.

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
Where did you guys do it?

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
Do what?

83
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,120
Do what? Sex, fornication,
making love, fucking..

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
What is there to understand?

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
Calm down, Raghav, calm down!

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,240
One thinks that one is
the master of his emotions-

87
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,120
but the emotions control you..

88
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,600
Where did you guys fuck?

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,320
Raghav, I don't think this is..

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,520
Is it inappropriate?
Am I making you feel awkward?

91
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,720
Am I being a nuisance?

92
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,480
My wife will come any minute now..

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Why don't I come and
see you another time?

94
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,080
You don't want me to meet your wife?
That wouldn't be proper, right?

95
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,120
Come on Raghav, you said we can
deal with this like adults

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,320
You are bang on.
Lets deal with this like adults

97
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,880
That'll be the best

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,120
Raghav please..
Calm down, please..

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
Try and understand..

100
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,480
I am calm. You are the
one who does not understand.

101
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
Why would I take revenge on you?

102
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,320
My wife has cheated on me- not you.

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
I am not married to you.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,960
If we were friends, it would be betrayal-
but you are not my friend either.

105
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,520
You are answerable
to your wife- not to me..

106
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,960
Raghav, please believe me,
its over between me and Chhaya

107
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,000
I know that. I know its over.

108
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,720
There, hold this.
I have spent a lot of money on this

109
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,480
But money is not everything, right?

110
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,520
- No, no..
- Then answer me

111
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
Where did you guys fuck?

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,600
At the office..

113
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,720
and sometimes on the tour..

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,960
- Did anybody else know about it?
- No, no, no.. we were very discreet?

115
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
No body knows..

116
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,760
And how was it?

117
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,400
How was the sex?

118
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,560
- It was.. it was
- It was what?

119
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,320
Good.. it was good..

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,640
It was good..?

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,560
Raghav, please understand..

122
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,800
it didn't mean anything.
It was just sex

123
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
It was just sex

124
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
- What?
- No, I didn't mean that

125
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,080
- What?
- I mean..

126
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
What do you mean it was just sex?

127
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,880
You could have said
a hundred things-

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
what do you mean
it was nothing, just for sex?

129
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,960
How is that supposed to make
me feel better? Have you lost it?

130
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
You could have said something else

131
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,800
How do you think it's
going to make me feel better?

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,600
Do you have any idea
how much this hurts man?

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She is my WIFE. I love her.

134
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,640
Atleast you could have loved her.
She is my wife

135
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,320
She is my WIFE. I love her.

136
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,480
Do you know how much this hurts?

137
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,160
What kind of a man are you!
You buy books but you don't read them.

138
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Screw it all!

139
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,720
Sunil..

140
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,240
Sunil

141
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,600
Why don't you pick the phone?
I was trying to call you!!

142
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,160
You wont believe what happened

143
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,400
That flower seller I go to,
they broke his little shop

144
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,880
Poor guy.. where will he go?

145
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,280
These flowers are so pretty, right?

146
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,840
These cops, I tell you
I parked the car for 10 minutes..

147
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,880
and they towed it away

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,200
Can you imagine?

149
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,800
Left it for 10 mintues...
and it was gone

150
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,960
Then?

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,680
Then I took a cab and got the car back,
otherwise you'd have sulked

152
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
Are you okay?

153
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,200
What happened, Sunil?

154
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,520
What happened?

155
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,880
Malti you know I love you, right?

156
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,280
You know I love you no matter what!

157
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,520
Yeah Sunil, what happened?

158
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,800
Promise me you wont freak out

159
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
- You are freaking me out now
- Promise me..

160
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,720
- Okay.. will you tell me now?
- Some shit has happened..

161
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,240
What?

162
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Who is he?

163
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,480
Did you know him?

164
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,000
- Is he..?
- He's dead

165
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,200
Did you?

166
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,080
Not I.. He killed himself

167
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,760
What are you saying Sunil?

168
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Some random guy walks
in here and kills himself?

169
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,080
Did you know him?

170
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,240
He is Anand, from my office.
I fired him last week

171
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,400
He came in today, said he was depressed,
I thought he just wanted to talk..

172
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,440
But he had a gun.. he just..

173
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,120
- Sunil you are not lying to me, are you?
- Malti, please..

174
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,880
Don't start this now, okay?

175
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,200
Why did you fire
him if he was depressed?

176
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,120
I didn't fire him because he was depressed,
he got depressed because I fired him.

177
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,800
Why did he come into the bedroom?

178
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,960
I got him into the bedroom, later..
Come here, I'll show you

179
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,800
See this.
It happenned right here

180
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,400
I was sitting over here.
At first I thought..

181
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,960
We have to call the police

182
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,160
Don't be mad- we can't
call the police. I am involved

183
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,200
There is a dead man in our house,
we haven't done anything!

184
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,400
They will never understand that.

185
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,760
He is in our house.
And he is dead.

186
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,480
So what do you want to do?
Nothing?

187
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,480
Let me think.. maybe we can call
somebody. Somebody who can help us.

188
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,160
They are here

189
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,640
Send them away.. tell them
its cancelled. I can't breathe..

190
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,960
Go inside.. let me handle this

191
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,200
Hold on.
Go inside

192
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Please open the door.
This gift is so heavy

193
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,800
- What have you got?
- I don't know.. some dry fruits..

194
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,360
Some dry fruit?
You don't know what you got for them?

195
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,000
Whatever!

196
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
Malti, open up- I need to pee

197
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,880
- Are you going to tell the whole building?
- I don't care

198
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,000
What took you so long?

199
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,840
- Hello.. Am I invited or not?
- Yes..

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
Happy Diwali

201
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,880
- Mama, get me some water.
- Get it yourself

202
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,520
Please tell me you guys
have ordered chilled beers

203
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,160
Or should I order?

204
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,440
No, Sunil has called for some

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,200
- Where is Sunil?
- He is in there.

206
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
I'll go check on him..

207
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,280
- Had water?
- Yes

208
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,400
Malti I didn't get those fancy lamps
so I just got the normal ones.

209
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,720
- Where did she go?
- She's gone to check up on Sunil

210
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,400
Check up, hunh?

211
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
I guess afternoons
are still the best..

212
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,680
- For what mama?
- For wifi..

213
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
- Hi Sunil..
- Hi guys.. Happy Diwali

214
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,560
You okay?

215
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,400
No, he is not feeling too good today

216
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,580
Completely under the weather..

217
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,240
Did you take any medicines?

218
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,240
Lets cancel it..

219
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,560
- He is not warm..
- No but he is really under the weather

220
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Oh you cuties..
Hold that, let me take a picture..

221
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
Smile a litte..

222
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Crazy traffic today..

223
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,920
Help me with this.

224
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,280
You are looking very nice

225
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,080
Takes a lot of hard work, okay?

226
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,720
- Shall I keep it in the freezer?
- Not the freezer

227
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Happy Diwali, Mister master chef

228
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Why such a sad happy diwali?

229
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,600
- He wants to cancel the party
- Are you mad?

230
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,880
I have got 5 kilo of mutton.

231
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,080
So many goats have given up their lives,
and you want to cancel the plan!

232
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,120
Just one goat!

233
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,680
How selfish are you!
What about her partner?

234
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,080
He must be all alone now, suffering

235
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,960
..and their 18 kids
who are now orphaned!

236
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,640
And his parents, his siblings?
Give them a thought!

237
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,640
How much you talk, Joshi..

238
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
If you really pity them,
turn vegetarian

239
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,040
What's with you?
Do you have fever? Stomach ache?

240
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,240
- Throat?
- Are you a doctor?

241
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,160
- He is fine!
- He's shivering.. it could be malaria

242
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
Malaria is not contagious

243
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,960
Lets do it another time,
maybe this Sunday.

244
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,520
You can't cancel it right now

245
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,400
Today is Diwali- not Sunday

246
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,800
All morning he was asking
me what time I'd reach.

247
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
Can't cancel..
I have invited a very special guest

248
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,120
- Who is your guest?
- Will tell you.

249
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,320
These online apps have
solved all my intimacy issues

250
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,120
What are you on?

251
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,280
mixer, blender, grinder,
I'm on all of them

252
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
What is with Joshi?
Cackling all the time

253
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,440
Does it look like he has
just come out of a broken marriage?

254
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,160
- Stop judging people..
- I will, I'm sorry- he is just so shallow

255
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,160
Alka, you know somebody
in the police, right?

256
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,320
Yes, what happened?

257
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,160
There's been an
accident on the highway

258
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
- You had an accident?
- No, a colleague at work.

259
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,320
It wasn't his fault really..

260
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,400
Nobody admits their mistakes

261
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,400
If somebody just jumps
in front of your car?

262
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,760
- Listen is this blouse very tight?
- Let me check..

263
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,200
- How bad was it?
- Don't know.. He didn't stop

264
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,560
So now, should one
report it to the police?

265
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,560
Are you mad? No way..
This is a hit and run case.

266
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
If the man is badly injured,

267
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,720
then this guy will be going
to the cops for the next 15 years..

268
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,880
and if he died..
then your friend is done in!

269
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
That's what I thought

270
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
- But this is not right.
- Right for who?

271
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,840
You don't go out looking for trouble!

272
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,960
What would you have done?

273
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,280
I would have done something..

274
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,680
That is what we all think-
I'd have done something.

275
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,400
But when the moment arrives,
your brain shuts down

276
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,440
- You're such a cynic..
- I am a realist!

277
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,200
So tell me..

278
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,640
Whatever is on your mind..

279
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,400
- I fucked up big time..
- I know that. What happened?

280
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,720
An affair

281
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,920
You are such an idiot.

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,800
Why would you do that?
Everything is going well for you.

283
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
Who is it?

284
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,520
- Somebody..
- Call if off, right away

285
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,320
- Its done
- Not a word about it now.

286
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,280
Whatever you do- just don't
tell anyone. Especially me

287
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,240
Don't sulk now.

288
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,960
What is the worst that
could happen- divorce.. Its okay.

289
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,840
That is the worst, right?

290
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,840
The only problem is, where would we go
for the party next year- yours or Malti's

291
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,360
Ah, the goddesses
descend on this earth

292
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,040
Joshi, don't sing..
how is the mutton doing?

293
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,280
Takes time to marienate it

294
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Go take a shower- you'll feel better

295
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,680
How is it that I love
you more everyday, butterfly?

296
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,040
Aww so cute..
Look at you two

297
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,800
There is no romance left in my life!!

298
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Nobody calls me butterfly..

299
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
What is this butterfly nonsense?

300
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,520
This is his new word for me,
for the past 3 months

301
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,160
I guess they're getting romantic
in their old age..

302
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Yeah, we try..

303
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Am I the only one
drinking at this party?

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,120
You guys go, party.
Don't mind me. I'll slave on..

305
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,080
How much you complain, Joshi!

306
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,840
Dhruva, get me one more beer

307
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,840
Submitting my son to child labour!

308
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,560
Stop pretending..

309
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,360
He's still in the shower?

310
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,280
Let him have a shower in peace..

311
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,200
We work as the master takes a shower.
Such a chauvinist!

312
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,840
- Happy Diwali
- Happy Diwali

313
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
How are you?

314
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,240
- You're looking beautiful
- wish them..

315
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,680
Happy Diwali, Sheetal

316
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,240
Happy Diwali Joshi

317
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
What are you so happy for?

318
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
Greetings!

319
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,400
- Where is Sunil?
- He is in the shower

320
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,040
He's been in the shower for an hour!

321
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,160
Call him- I have some news to share

322
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,960
- What is Rahul's news?
- He is dying to show off. Please don't ask..

323
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Sunil.. are you okay?

324
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,080
Is he okay?

325
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,280
Sunil, hurry up-
Rahul has some great news

326
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,200
Is everything okay?

327
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,760
- You think he's fainted?
- I can hear the water running..

328
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,640
- Paro?
- He said he had the shivers..

329
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Sunil say something

330
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,560
Break the bloody door

331
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,120
Sunil, Rahul has reallly good news,
come out!

332
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I have more than good news

333
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,880
Sunil, come on out, man..

334
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,400
- No option but to break open the door.
- Do it guys, break it open

335
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,920
Stop these attention
seeking tactics Sunil..

336
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
Sunil, say something

337
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,280
- Is he fine?
- I don't know..

338
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,520
he had the shivers and all earlier..

339
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,560
- Happy Diwali
- Happy Diwali

340
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,600
- He is out finally
- You're okay?

341
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,560
- Can't a man shower in peace?
- For so long?

342
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,880
- We were going to call for the fire brigade.
- Water pressure was too low..

343
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,296
I don't know how you deal with him.
He is worse than Dhruva

344
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,840
What is the noise about?

345
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,880
- Can I tell you my good news now?
- Yes please..

346
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,560
We've been waiting for you

347
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,600
My book is finally getting published

348
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
He is dying to show off

349
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,280
That is great news Rahul

350
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,320
This is the happiest Diwali ever

351
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,440
Have some sweet.. have it

352
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,920
Happiest Diwali ever!

353
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,680
- So proud of you Rahul..
- I'll change and come

354
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,760
- Where are you going?
- I'll change and come

355
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,640
- It's a bit much..
- Kids, some sweet?

356
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,200
- Who is the publisher?
- It's a new publisher

357
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,520
How many drafts, Rahul?

358
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,320
4 drafts, after that
looking for a publisher.

359
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,600
That took the longest time.

360
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,600
- When did this happen?
- Three days back.

361
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,000
But I thought I should
wait till diwali to tell you all

362
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,240
- What is the title of your book?
- WHAT IS DONE IS DONE

363
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
- It can not be undone..
- No no, not that far..

364
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,920
That's a friend

365
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,400
- Cheers to Rahul..
- He knows what I need

366
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,880
Rahul it takes a lot of
courage to give up a good job

367
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,840
Why, most writers have a day job

368
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,040
Even I have an announcement to make.
My name is not Joshi anymore- it is Sagar

369
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,080
- But your name has always been Sagar
- But you all call me Joshi

370
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,000
Stop it Joshi!

371
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
What happened?

372
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,960
Dhruva got burnt

373
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,240
Every Diwali there's an accident

374
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,320
How did it happen?

375
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,000
- I didn't do anything, it was an accident.
- You have to be more careful

376
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,360
I told you to go down and play

377
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
- Its okay, he'll be fine
- What do you mean its okay?

378
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,360
He's getting a blister

379
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,320
- Malti do you have an ointment
- Yes getting it.

380
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,040
He's such a brave boy- not even crying

381
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,760
- Let him cry if he wants to!
- But mama, I don't feel like crying..

382
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
But you have to!
Cry, whether or not you feel like it

383
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,440
Really, it takes a
village to raise a child..

384
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,040
Earlier we used to
live in joint families..

385
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,280
What are you trying to say?
That I'm not capable?

386
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,880
I'm not saying that..

387
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,800
But you are implying that
single mothers are not good enough

388
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,840
I raised him up myself-
there was no bloody village

389
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,040
- Paro, your courage is admirable
- What does it have to do with courage?

390
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,160
Its a matter of choice

391
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,440
I don't need to prove to
anybody that I'm a good mother

392
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,880
Exactly! You are a good mother

393
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,200
- I have made mutton for you all..
- Joshi, there is a time to joke..

394
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,120
- Vivan just say sorry to Dhruva
- But I didn't..

395
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,000
And no more fireworks now.

396
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,480
Why is she over reacting?

397
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Okay fine, Joshi- say sorry to Paro

398
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
- For what?
- Just say sorry

399
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,000
And don't treat me like a victim.

400
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,240
You are a brilliant mother, Paro

401
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
I didn't plan on being a single mom, okay?

402
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,320
It just happened,
I'm trying to do the best I can

403
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,720
Come Joshi, lets check on the mutton

404
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,440
- He didn't mean it..
- Paro, seriously sorry

405
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,320
- Does everything have to be a joke?
- Let it go, Paro..

406
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,560
Whatever..

407
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,360
He didn't mean it

408
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,520
- Happy Diwali
- Happy Diwali

409
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,440
Happy Diwali..
Does anyone have 200 rupees? 200..?

410
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Sunil get my wallet

411
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,280
Happy Diwali, Malti

412
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,680
What the hell is this?

413
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,400
They give the most bizarre
gifts at these corporate events

414
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,800
And you are trying to pass it on?

415
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,520
- Don't you like it?
- No

416
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,160
Sir.. this is for you. Happy Diwali

417
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,560
No, you must not refuse

418
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
- My fare?
- Wait.. I'm getting it

419
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,880
- Hi
- Hello.. You look wow

420
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,960
He is mad, I can't believe
he gave it to the cab driver

421
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,240
Take off your shoes please.

422
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,840
I'm not going to leave them outside-
they are very expensive shoes..

423
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,440
Besides, I don't trust any of you

424
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,760
- Not even me?
- Except Alka.

425
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,160
Give him the news

426
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,240
Breaking news-
Rahul's book is being published

427
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,080
After four years of struggle!

428
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,280
He was busy writing,
WE were the ones struggling

429
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,240
Come on Sheetal,
give the poor guy a break

430
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,840
Listen, I love him but the truth is
that we were struggling

431
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,720
Come on Sheetal,
lay off the poor man for once

432
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,960
- No no, this man is a hero.
- There he goes again.

433
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,880
He is the only one who
asked the universe correctly.

434
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,640
Sir, the universe is like your cook

435
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,400
Really.. This is a fact!

436
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,040
Every morning the cook asks you,
'Sir what shall I serve you today?'

437
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,600
And what do you say? 'Anything..'

438
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
That is why you are served veggies!

439
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
You have to be specific boss!

440
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,960
You have to say,
'No, I want mutton curry. Boneless.

441
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,080
With some onions
dipped in vinegar..

442
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,000
And for dessert- some kulfi..

443
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,360
And you shall receive

444
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,560
- Sunil
- That's all it takes? just ask?

445
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,840
You have to go shop
for the ingredients

446
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,080
I must tell you, the cook took
a long time getting the right order

447
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,160
The cook has many other
orders to look into..

448
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,160
Come on, show some money.
My husband doesn't give free advice

449
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,920
What are we going
to do with him Sunil?

450
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
I don't know.
We'll see tomorrow

451
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,760
- Yeah but where?
- I can't think straight right now.

452
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,320
We'll leave him on the terrace

453
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,120
Can't do that.
They put a lock on the terrace

454
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,240
What? Since when?

455
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,280
It was decided in
the last society meeting

456
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
This housing society is the pits

457
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,120
Why would they ruin it for everybody?

458
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
The terrace is for everybody.

459
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,760
- We'll leave this house
- Tomorrow morning?

460
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,880
No- but we won't renew
the lease next time

461
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,000
This house is inauspicious

462
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,480
You know we've been going
for couples counselling

463
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,200
These counsellors don't know a thing

464
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,800
We used to start
fighting in his office

465
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,560
Once we were so loud, another
couple ran away from the waiting room

466
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,840
The counsellor said, 'please leave.
I can't manage you guys'

467
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,920
Really. He said,
'your wife knows everything'

468
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,400
Yeah right, blame it on her

469
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,640
- It takes two to navigate, Joshi
- Call me Sagar!

470
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,040
What is this name change business?
Sagar doesn't sound like you

471
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,840
Sounds like a cheap food joint

472
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,760
And why would you change your name?

473
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,560
Why not?

474
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,360
If you can change the names of cities,
why can't a man change his name?

475
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,200
And then Sagar IS my name I am not
saying call me Arnold Shwarzeneggar

476
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,200
What has changed?
I still call VT by its old name..

477
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,040
Shh.. Have you reached?

478
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,160
Do you see a.. coconut tree?

479
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,400
Stay there,
I'm coming- don't helter skelter

480
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,760
How will you manage French, Joshi?

481
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,960
- Alka, keep stirring it
- You'll get burnt..

482
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,920
Unbelievable, you really are my hero.

483
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,280
Through all the hurt and humiliation,
you ploughed through.

484
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,760
- That's conviction. That is success.
- Thank you

485
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,680
You never gave up.

486
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,880
You never reacted to the fact-
my wife doesn't believe in me.

487
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,200
Are my friends laughing?

488
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,840
Is my book even good.
Am I even a writer? No!

489
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
You stuck with it boss

490
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,880
That is conviction.. Cheers

491
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,720
Who is the publisher?

492
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,880
Its a new company..
moonfool publications

493
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And.. how many copies?

494
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,760
In the first run- 3000

495
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,600
3000? That is all?

496
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,880
It's a start

497
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,720
3000 is too little

498
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,560
What is done is done- just 3000?

499
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,600
It's a start, Yogesh!

500
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,000
Too late, too little. I told you,
Rahul- you must have a vision board.

501
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,880
You look into the mirror every
morning and say, 'Boss I want success'

502
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,520
You want a Bentley, you imagine
yourself driving that Bentley.

503
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,960
- You must smell the leather
- I dont want a Bentley, ok?

504
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,640
No, whatever car you like,
that's not the point

505
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,120
You are scared of your own success

506
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,400
- You are scared of it
- Okay

507
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,520
But never mind, in this
loss also there is an opportunity

508
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,400
This is a loss?
This is the happiest day of my life

509
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,520
This is a loss?

510
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,120
3000 is too little..
I have an idea..

511
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,200
Hear me out.. Focus

512
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,520
How much does each copy cost?

513
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
About 300..

514
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,880
Okay, arrange 900,000 rupees
from somewhere.

515
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,000
When the book releases..

516
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,040
.. that month,
quietly buy out all the copies

517
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
- Are you mad?
- Everybody is doing it Rahul

518
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,960
If I buy out all the copies,
who will read it then?

519
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,600
That is the game Rahul-
Its a sureshot success

520
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,480
The publishing house will be zapped.

521
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,420
And the public will be like,
'oh he is successful...

522
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,120
we want to be part of that'

523
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,920
No, thanks..
My book will sell on its own merit

524
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,920
Merit? Where will 3000 reach on merit?

525
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,680
It's cool. Somebody will read it-
if not now, then after I die..

526
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
See, if somebody has to be found,
he'll be found

527
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,480
To be found? How sweet!
Are you oil?

528
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,160
If you are not oil, sir-
nobody is looking for you!

529
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,400
You must find yourself!
For 900,000 you will find yourself!

530
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,000
- You'll become a millionaire
- No thank you, let me just do it my way

531
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,840
Okay done.
No problem.

532
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
But I am happy for you. Cheers..

533
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,960
So what is the story?

534
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
You read the book

535
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,840
Tell me a little..

536
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,520
Please, Rahul..

537
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,720
Well its our story..

538
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,440
What do you mean its our story?
Its your story. How is it ours?

539
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,800
Yeah.. but it is
the story of all of us

540
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,200
We are all a part of your book?

541
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,520
- I'm also in the book?
- Yes

542
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,320
- I'm in the book?
- Yes

543
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,840
What's my name?

544
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
Anand. Anand.. nice.
So what does Anand do?

545
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,320
Anand is a motivational speaker..
and a part time priest

546
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,880
Part time priest.. nice

547
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,640
So what happens to Anand?

548
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,160
- Should I tell you?
- Yes please, this is exciting

549
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,760
Well, about two thirds
into the film.. No, book!

550
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
No, this is good!

551
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,800
See, subconcious wants it.

552
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,000
Now you're projecting Rahul- film,
TV series, success..

553
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,040
It's a book

554
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,120
So about two thirds into the book..

555
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
Anand kills himself

556
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,560
Because he realises that..

557
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,520
behind all the facade,
the empty words, there is nothing..

558
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,840
Its just emptiness..

559
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,560
There's no real person there,
you see..

560
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,400
This is a really fucked up idea..

561
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,040
Read the book first..
don't judge it yet

562
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,080
Really I'm quite amazed at you Rahul..

563
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,040
For 4 years, there is a myth about Rahul
writing a book, behind closed doors...

564
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,680
and you go and write
about your friends?

565
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,560
Its not about..

566
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,240
A man can only write about
what he knows- and I know you guys

567
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,920
There is a thing called imagination.
Murakami isn't writing about his day.

568
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,640
Rumi never said,
I woke up and had breakfast-

569
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,120
Toast was burnt,
what is this shit?

570
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,240
- Have you read Murakami?
- Why should I read it?

571
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,520
One doesn't become Murakami
merely by reading Murakami

572
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,960
- This is ridiculous..
- Why are you arguing about this?

573
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,920
I have built an empire. You are saying
I'm committing suicide. I'm depressed

574
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,360
When have I looked depressed to you?
I'm super happy

575
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,680
Its not YOU!

576
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
Fine, you should
remove me from the book

577
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,640
- Remove you from the book?
- I could sue you

578
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,560
Its going to be published
in three weeks..

579
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,120
I could completely sue you.
I'll sue you

580
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,120
I'll sue you, I'll sue you.
Boss what are you talking about?

581
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,680
I'm not dying.
I can't die. I'll sue you

582
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,440
Yogesh have you lost it?

583
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,880
OR, I'll sue you

584
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,120
Rahul I've got a great idea.
Just watch this..

585
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,880
I'll sue you.
Your book will be in trouble.

586
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,160
If you are lucky
it might even get banned

587
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,160
- Then people will really want to read it
- Yogesh I don't want your help!

588
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,000
- It's brilliant
- I don't want your help

589
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,760
You're scared of your success Rahul

590
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,440
- You're scared of your own potential
- I'll ask you if I need your help..

591
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,760
Enough!

592
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,840
- This is not your house?
- No, its a friend's house

593
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,760
- But that's not okay?
- No no it's okay

594
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,120
No.. I feel.. comment dire.. awkward

595
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,880
No need to be awkward.
They are like my family

596
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,880
- See this?
- Very beautiful

597
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
This is Rangoli

598
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,880
Today is Diwali. So doors
are kept open for Goddess Lakshmi..

599
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,880
Charming..

600
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,840
Shoes!

601
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,480
You like my shoes?

602
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,480
Very nice.. France?

603
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
Everybody,
here is my friend, Francoise Marie

604
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,080
Hello!
Happy Diwali..

605
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,160
This is Malti, that is Sunil-
Its their house actually

606
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,640
Well done Joshi

607
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,680
- Here's some wine
- She is so sweet

608
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,600
- Thank you for inviting me
- Of course, anytime

609
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,920
She has come with her shoes on..

610
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,120
Shoes..

611
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,640
Sorry, what about my shoes?

612
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,320
You have to take them off

613
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,640
I didn't tell you- in Indian
homes you have to take off your shoes.

614
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,480
You can sit and do it

615
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,760
Don't worry- she'll manage..

616
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,880
She seems uneducated

617
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,800
- It's okay..
- Her heels are so long

618
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,560
She'll manage

619
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,480
Go and put on your shoes

620
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,560
I got it on camera

621
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,440
Shit!

622
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,360
- The party just started
- Everything happens for a reason

623
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,480
This was your favourite
Vietnamese vase, right?

624
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,520
Sunil, go get a mop!

625
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
- I am really sorry guys
- It's okay..

626
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,200
Malti I'll get you a new one..

627
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,520
Maybe it's better I get out of here..

628
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Get some flour..

629
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,640
- Hi I am Alka
- Alka, Francoise Marie

630
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,440
Yogesh

631
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,080
Calm down!

632
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,640
It was just an accident. So..

633
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,200
Calm down Alka!

634
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,320
I will put it back together

635
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,240
I don't want a broken vase

636
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,120
Nothing is broken..

637
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,960
Or else, everything is broken-
Perspective!

638
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,360
Everything happens for a reason

639
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,160
After I put it back together,
it'll be better than before.

640
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,680
Paro, its broken!

641
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,640
I am so sorry,
are you going to drink something?

642
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,880
I'd like a glass of red wine

643
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,800
- I'll get it
- Joshi sit down.

644
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,480
Baby get her a glass of red wine
and get me a beer please

645
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,240
No drinks for you,
you've had too many.

646
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,600
Guys relax!
No one died, it's a party

647
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,840
Are you switching
on the air conditioning?

648
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,160
There is a stench- can't you smell it?

649
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,160
The whole city is stinking-
either its garbage or piss

650
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,280
Why do you have to be disgusting?

651
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,560
Its just a word-
why is the word disagreeable?

652
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,720
- It sounds so down market, cheap.
- It's just a word

653
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,720
Sir, words also need branding

654
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,960
You guys are illiterate.
This is how they say it in Persian.

655
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,400
Persian used to be the language
of highly educated people

656
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,600
He is a great great author, our friend

657
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,240
His book is getting published

658
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,520
Please don't let it get to his head.

659
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,520
Can you just let him
enjoy his moment for once

660
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,640
- Listen it's not yet been published
- It will, very soon..

661
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,600
- She is saying, congratulations.
- I heard her, idiot!

662
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,280
So Francoise..

663
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,400
Francoise Marie

664
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,720
Marie.. I have a question.

665
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,720
I often notice the French people,

666
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,040
sometimes they kiss twice,
sometimes three times..

667
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,280
Yeah it's confusing

668
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,680
Baby, why do you care
what the French people do?

669
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,880
Quiet.. Its such
an interesting question

670
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,760
Oh its actually very confusing
In Paris we kiss two times

671
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,080
in the South, it's three times..

672
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,840
and sometimes in
Montpellier it is four times

673
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,960
No- that is not what I'm asking.
Why three times, what is the logic?

674
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,280
Perhaps in the confusion
we are hoping for an accident..

675
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,080
where the lips are meeting

676
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,280
I love France

677
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,560
- Joshi, stop drooling all over her
- Have you ever been to France?

678
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,960
No, never!

679
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,200
He doesn't have a passport

680
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,600
Sir here's your parcel

681
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,280
What is this smell?
Is it stale food?

682
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,400
No sir, its fresh

683
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,280
Fresh, my ass! smell it..

684
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,080
Its fresh sir..

685
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,720
Crap! Give me the bill

686
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,920
- Happy diwali, sir..
- What is happy about it?

687
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,320
Do I look happy?

688
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,120
Sunil

689
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,360
Hey Kaizaad

690
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,080
- Happy Diwali
- Happy Diwali, so nice to see you man

691
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,040
- Thanks for coming
- Thank you for having me

692
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,240
- Malti see who is here
- Coming

693
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,360
- Where is everybody else
- There are strolling in

694
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,600
- Happy Diwali
- Happy Diwali, please come.

695
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,920
Joshi, I feel this house
has a bad aura..

696
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,840
What?

697
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,480
Aura.. you know, energy.
I feel it very strong

698
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,640
- Hello beautiful, you like it?
- It's gorgeous

699
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,440
Come guys, come in

700
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,120
Happy Diwali.
Please come, come..

701
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,880
- Take the shoes off?
- Yeah, shoes right here..

702
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,700
She is my most dependable
source of alcohol in the house

703
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,960
Sorry, sorry carry on

704
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,600
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Sure I will

705
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:46,720
What are you drinking? No whiskey, no rum..?
Are you okay?

706
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,680
Excuse me,
can I just talk to him for a minute.

707
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,400
Don't be alarmed, nothing serious

708
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,720
Listen, the book launch is
in three weeks. You have to be there

709
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,640
Of course I will..

710
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,440
Can I tell you something more soppy?

711
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,280
I could not imagine a better
celebration for my big day.

712
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,080
This is the happiest day of my life

713
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,760
- We all love you, man.
- This is the happiest day of my life

714
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,800
And listen,
I'll do anything for you..

715
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,120
- Where you going?
- I am right here.

716
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,160
- I think Kaizaad is looking for you.
- For me?

717
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,800
Happy Diwali, Sunil sir..

718
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,360
Why have you come here?

719
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,960
Chhaya, think a little

720
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,840
Did you think?

721
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,560
Are you always careful?

722
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,480
By the way I am very touched.
You chose to wear this shirt tonight

723
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,880
Does Malti know I gave it to you?

724
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,760
No? Shall I tell her then?

725
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,840
Its not funny

726
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,400
Relax, I am not an idiot

727
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,240
He knows

728
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,200
She doesn't

729
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,440
Not her, Raghav.
Raghav, my husband- he knows

730
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So then..?

731
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,560
Nothing. He has been completely
quiet for two days. Not a word..

732
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,520
And now I can't trace him

733
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,480
- Where has he gone?
- I don't know.

734
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,680
He is not answering his phone.
I've been trying to call him

735
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,440
I'm getting really worried now

736
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,960
You should go home. Today is diwali.
He'll return home eventually

737
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,640
- You are not listening to me. He knows!
- I heard you. You told me already

738
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,400
Look, just go home, Chhaya, okay?

739
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,160
He'll come back there

740
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,520
That is all you can think about.

741
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,520
Go home, leave. Why are you here?
Get out of my party

742
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,520
Hold this

743
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,000
- Read this
- What is it?

744
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,600
He left it on the fridge. Read it

745
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,840
- Francoise, this is for you
- Thank you

746
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,840
Sunil, come inside

747
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,840
- Hello
- Hi

748
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,480
Who was that?
You didn't introduce us

749
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,400
Joshi you are really
too much sometimes

750
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,200
- Why not? I am a free bird
- But she is not

751
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,200
She is married, that too happily

752
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,520
Marriages are not forever.
One must think of future investment

753
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,760
Every time you open your mouth,
some filth comes out

754
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,880
- What is filthy about this?
- Is everything okay?

755
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,160
Yes, he owes him some money

756
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,600
You have a date with you,
and you are eyeing somebody else.

757
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,360
That is the kind of filth you are..

758
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,920
He'll give you your money back buddy

759
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,520
Sunil, are you alright?

760
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,560
Crap! Why did everyone
have to come today?

761
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,000
You invited us today.
Today is Diwali

762
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Go celebrate diwali then..

763
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,880
Bad aura

764
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,080
I feel it, its here

765
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,680
Is this the right house?

766
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,520
Their names are written there.

767
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,000
- Malti!
- Uncle is that you?

768
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,680
Take it off.
How will she recognise you?

769
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,840
You didn't inform us
that you were coming

770
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,400
Well you didn't inform
us about the party.

771
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,160
We were in your city,
thought we'd drop in

772
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,480
I told him to call you
but he wanted it to be a surprise

773
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,680
Malti, there's no vodka

774
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,440
Hello.. recognise me?
I am your wife's uncle!

775
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,840
Gave you a Japanese tea set
for your wedding

776
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,440
- He is not her husband
- No?

777
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,560
He forgets faces now a days-
one day he'll forget me too

778
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,960
- Happy Diwali
- Happy Diwali

779
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,840
He is the one? Are you sure?
Why are you looking so pensive?

780
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,800
Many happy returns of the day..

781
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,480
Gave you the japanese tea set
for your wedding, remember?

782
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,520
Will you give her the sweets or no?

783
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,760
Thank you..
please come in

784
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,360
- Are there many people inside?
- Do you want to count them from here?

785
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,120
Are you okay?

786
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,640
Yeah, I'm fine

787
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,880
- Come here boy- what is your name?
- Dhruva

788
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:51,040
Uncle this is not my son
Paro- come here.. He is her son

789
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,320
I am just saying that
he has grown so tall

790
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,040
- Where is yours?
- We don't have a child

791
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,680
'Nothing is amiss Chhaya,
nothing has changed'

792
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,400
'I think to myself every morning
that today I will fight with you'

793
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,680
'But I don't have any anger towards you'

794
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,560
'You are still the same for me.
But what was between us, has changed'

795
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,320
'And that absence bothers me.
I can't live with these lies'

796
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,960
'Just remember, it wasn't your fault'

797
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,680
'Its not you- Its me. I am an idiot.
Yours, Raghu'

798
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,600
- Are you a non vegetarian?
- I am a vegetarian

799
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,080
Would you like to have some soup?
I'll make it for you

800
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,080
Are you guys doing okay?
Can I get you another drink?

801
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,480
No I have a drink

802
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,120
How long have you been
working with Sunil?

803
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,280
Its been a year

804
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,160
Really? I have never met you before

805
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,880
Yeah, I guess it never worked out

806
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,120
Are you from here?

807
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,520
I am from Ahmedabad- but
after marriage I shifted here.

808
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,920
Where do you stay in Bombay?

809
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,160
- Versova
- Oh I live in Thane

810
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,640
He lives very far

811
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,320
What's your name again?
Sorry.. excuse me

812
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,800
Just give me a minute

813
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,320
- Sagar
- Hi, Chhaya

814
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,280
Are you on facebook?

815
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,920
I am on facebook,
I don't use it that much

816
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,680
Now as fast as you can,
with instinct..

817
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,320
..you must tell which card
is red and which one is black

818
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,120
Okay okay black sorry

819
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,200
And now I want to do the opposite

820
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,560
Magic is not over.
Why are you clapping?

821
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,240
If everything go well this
will be all red and then all black

822
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,120
Yogesh, if he has done a good job..

823
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,320
It will be all red and all black,
am I correct?

824
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,960
It will be, it has to be..

825
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,200
Power to us..

826
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,320
This one will be opposite

827
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,840
- Can I give her a kiss?
- Please, please..

828
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,360
Shouldn't have had those shots guys..

829
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Why do you mix your drinks?

830
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,360
Rahul, have you met my uncle and aunt?

831
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,880
Hello Sir. Rahul

832
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,880
Take his autograph. Next time
you come here, he will be a celebrity

833
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,520
Are you on television?

834
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,920
He is a big author.
His book is getting published

835
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
- What have you written?
- I have written a novel

836
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,840
What's the story?

837
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,600
I can't tell the story in
a few words.. Its a book in Hindi

838
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,080
I know Hindi. Tell me

839
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,760
Why are you wearing that mask?

840
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Actually, my nose is very sharp-

841
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,320
like a dog's

842
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,160
I get all kinds of distant smell

843
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,640
And all kinds of diseases- malaria,
dengue, chicken gunia

844
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,240
How can I get chicken gunia
when I don't even eat chicken

845
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,720
She is going senile.

846
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,280
She wears the mask all day-
goes to sleep with it. Wont let me kiss her

847
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,560
Are you going to kiss me at this age?

848
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,560
There is no age for kissing.
Didn't I marry you?

849
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,600
- And I kissed you then
- There were no germs then?

850
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,960
Our metabolism was strong then..

851
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,920
I have found a new character

852
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,280
Take a bite sir, its good food.

853
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,160
Good food man.
Have a bite

854
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,600
Aren't we going to play cards?

855
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,760
What are you doing?

856
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,800
- Its smelling
- Mine is not smelling, sir, mine is fine

857
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,720
Its rotting.
Everybody will fall sick

858
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,920
What are you doing Sunil?
My mutton.

859
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,520
- Its gone bad
- Its not! Took me five hours to cook

860
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,400
Hold this

861
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,240
Are you mad?
people are hungry..

862
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,680
Sir this is good- this we ordered in

863
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,280
We'll order more

864
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,720
- Sir it's very late now.
- You guys have no values

865
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,640
Sunil, the watchman is calling you..
what's going on?

866
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,480
Everybody is eating rotten food

867
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,720
- Threw away all the food?
- All of it

868
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,840
- All of it?
- There is some rice left

869
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,960
Somebody has parked
a car in Asif's parking

870
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,480
- Nobody here
- Sir, he came to your flat..

871
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,240
Guys.. has anyone
come in a Swift Desire?

872
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,160
Guys.. has anyone
come in a Swift Desire?

873
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,040
- Is it yours?
- We took an Uber

874
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,520
- Nobody here
- He came to your flat..

875
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,480
Been here since the afternoon

876
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,800
- Go play outside please
- wait, in a minute

877
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,320
Right now. Move

878
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,600
Move out.
I have some work

879
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,920
Sorry, Asif saheb..

880
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,640
- Sir happy Diwali
- Bugger off

881
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,600
There is no food?

882
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
Are the children
supposed to sleep hungry?

883
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,520
- I'll make some noodles..
- What crap! Its supposed to be diwali.

884
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,720
She is always in a foul mood

885
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,280
There are eggs, noodles..

886
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,760
Clearly the counselling is not working

887
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,320
- I am doing all the work guys, come on.
- This box is so heavy

888
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,840
What is in this trunk?

889
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,720
What are you doing?
Why did you get this out? Malti!

890
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,400
Why have you get this out?

891
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,720
What are you doing?

892
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,680
We are setting up a casino-
to play cards

893
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,520
Your uncle had a knee surgery,
he can't sit down

894
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,560
- We'll get something else
- This will do fine.. move

895
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,240
- Why this?
- Why not this?

896
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,120
Let's get started..

897
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,080
Sunil, its okay

898
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,280
Who the hell are these people?

899
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,000
They are our friends

900
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,760
I feel like I don't know any of them

901
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,120
- Will you let me play in peace?
- Don't play blind

902
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
Aren't you playing?

903
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,520
What are the chances I'd win today?

904
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,480
You never know

905
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,040
- Don't touch my cards
- Why, they'll change?

906
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,040
You always spoil my game..

907
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,960
Do you want to play?
come join us..

908
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,280
Relationship goals..
oh my god!!

909
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,720
You two look so cute together

910
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,760
Shall I take a picture? I'll whatsapp
it to you. hash tag togetherness

911
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,800
Sunil, still blind?

912
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,000
Blind!

913
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,800
Lucky you.
Beautiful home, beautiful wife

914
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,360
Beautiful mistress.

915
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,000
You are truly blessed

916
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,520
Worst cards possible

917
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,600
You are just unlucky in cards,
lucky in love

918
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,840
Look at me. I lose at cards
and you know how good is MY love life

919
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,320
What was I for you? A fling?

920
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,400
Answer her- she wants to know

921
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,160
- Why did you do it?
- Chhaya, why did YOU do it?

922
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,000
- I haven't done anything
- Really? nothing?

923
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,520
- Was it just me? Was it all my fault?
- I agree with him there

924
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,160
Its not just him. It takes two to..

925
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,960
What is that dance?
It takes two to..

926
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,560
It takes two to...

927
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,760
It takes two to...

928
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,000
TANGO

929
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,080
Tango..

930
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,000
I've got a sequence again. I win..

931
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,320
If you want to have kids,
there should be a test- an audition

932
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,360
You are unemployed.

933
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,120
Your wife is an alcoholic- you
shouldn't be allowed to be a parent!

934
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,560
- But who is going to decide?
- I don't know

935
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,020
So the government will decide
whether I'm fit enough to be a mother?

936
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,000
That's not what I am saying

937
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,200
- Are you in or out?
- Show me. I have folded, show me

938
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,680
I am so touched by your love

939
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,400
Tell me honestly,
how good was your tango?

940
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,160
Just fold!

941
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,880
Okay fold

942
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,560
She only listens to you

943
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,680
- I have a pair of fours
- You win, sir..

944
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,800
- I could have won, see?
- Why did you fold?

945
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,880
Shit happens, Chhaya

946
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,960
- Why did you make me fold?
- He could have had anything. It's risky..

947
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,200
- Sir, you have to take a little risk
- He is the champion of risk taking

948
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,240
I could have won!
You made me lose

949
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,880
I didn't force you. You have to take
responsibility for your own action

950
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,720
Sheetal, give me some money

951
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,080
- I'll return your money
- Sheetal, his book is getting published..

952
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,760
Ask her for a quickie. Look at her,
she is upset- it'll lift her mood

953
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,400
- You are responsible for my loss
- Suggest it to her

954
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,920
All you care about is you and
your happy domestic life

955
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,600
I have a request- can I watch? Please?
She is my wife. I should be allowed.

956
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,680
Please.. let me.
Ask her.. We can do a menage de trois

957
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,240
- Sheetal!
- Shut up!

958
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,200
What happened?

959
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,760
Why are you begging
for money all the time?

960
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,360
There, take this, play!

961
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,160
And this is for your loss, okay?
There, take this- play now

962
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,000
Calm down, Sunil! I don't
want your money, take it back..

963
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,400
- Guys please don't do this..
- I'd just started winning..

964
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,720
Why are you spoiling the game..

965
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:31,120
I am saying, have kids. One or two
is fine, but you can't have 6 kids!!

966
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,000
- But who is going to decide?
- Don't you see?

967
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,480
Yogesh, his highness will decide..

968
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,000
He has the authority on this..

969
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,760
- Now you are getting emotional about this.
- Of course I am. I am a mother..

970
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,320
Her taxi is waiting,
she came in to say goodbye

971
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,520
Yes I came to say bye..

972
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,920
- Bye..
- Good to meet you..

973
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,640
Malti did you see her magic?

974
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,800
Yeah, I saw some outside,
it's really good

975
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,240
She's an amazing magician..

976
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,920
No, I'm not a magician.
Actually I am a mentalist

977
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,120
What's that?

978
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,520
I see things.. I read minds.. yes

979
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,400
Wow, good..

980
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,960
Can you read my mind?

981
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,680
Yes..

982
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,400
Oh you want me tell everybody?

983
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,480
Are you sure?

984
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,840
You don't want him
to write another book

985
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,040
I'm sorry, you asked me,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

986
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,200
Nice! Do one more..

987
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,840
On you?
- No..

988
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,760
Why?

989
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,080
- Nothing to read or what?
- How about me?

990
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,560
Okay.. Do you have
a purse or a bag?

991
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,480
Put your hand inside-
pick something..

992
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,160
Its round, its pink,
its your lipstick

993
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,880
Another time.. Round again..

994
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,240
Its your glasses,
your spectacles

995
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,520
One more time..

996
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,760
Its round again.. An orange strap
Its a watch- your orange watch

997
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,160
Oh my god!

998
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,280
One more time.
Do her..

999
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,440
No!

1000
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,800
That's enough magic for one night

1001
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,760
Yes, you're right.
I have my taxi waiting..

1002
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,120
Thank you for coming..

1003
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,640
Yes.. And I'm very
sorry about the vase

1004
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,080
That's okay.. good night

1005
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,760
- You enjoy your night..
- She is going by the way..

1006
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,240
- Are you leaving?
- Where are you going? Sit..

1007
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,560
- Thank you very much for tonight..
- No, thank you for coming

1008
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,480
Everything will be okay

1009
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,120
What will be okay?

1010
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,600
Everything..

1011
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,760
Bye

1012
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,080
I'll see her off

1013
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,560
"Careful now..."

1014
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,880
"these are trying times"

1015
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,920
"Careful"

1016
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,920
"of these blurring lines"

1017
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,760
"What's gone.."

1018
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,600
"is not coming back"

1019
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:49,920
"And the present is
thick with uncertainty"

1020
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,160
Did you take my 500 rupees?

1021
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,600
Is that my money?

1022
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,640
No it had drifted that side,
I took it back.

1023
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,680
Keep it in your purse

1024
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,160
This man is lying through his teeth

1025
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,000
You are stealing 500?

1026
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,440
Go on, play the game

1027
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,960
Screw the game.
That is my 500 rupees

1028
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,400
- That's my money..
- Just because you said so?

1029
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,560
I saw you picking it up

1030
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,560
Sunil, didn't you see him?

1031
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,560
But I saw him.
The man is a bloody scoundrel

1032
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,880
Hold it. Even I know how to abuse

1033
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,600
Please take her away

1034
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,120
- Here, take this.
- I don't want your shitty money.

1035
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,840
I want my money

1036
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,880
What's going on?

1037
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,200
See, we come to your house
and this is the treatment we get

1038
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,600
Hello, aunty,
did I say a thing to you?

1039
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,840
Am I talking to you?
What did I say to you?

1040
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,040
Don't entertain her..

1041
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,960
Alka, let it go..
- I wont let it go.

1042
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:50,080
He is a bloody cheat man,
he is a snake

1043
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,920
Did you call me a snake?

1044
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,080
Look at your self.
You can't even stand straight

1045
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,440
You should not drink.
Its not for women to drink

1046
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,120
I drink with my own money

1047
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,880
There is a grace to drinking.
You can't do it

1048
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,720
Are you going to teach me?
Then teach me how to steal money too

1049
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,560
What do you say, writer man?

1050
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,000
- Rahul, he is a thief..
- I'm in no position to comment

1051
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,840
You just lost your money,
I am being abused!

1052
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,160
You deserve to be abused

1053
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,560
Just stop it.

1054
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,040
Stop this bloody game

1055
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,560
Screw this shit.
Its a crap bloody party

1056
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,920
It was so good to see
you after so many years

1057
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,560
Festivals bring the family together

1058
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,880
When your father was alive,
he kept the whole family together

1059
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,360
He was something else.. he was

1060
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,560
Now the family has drifted apart

1061
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,880
Keep this..

1062
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,360
What is this?

1063
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,120
It's auspicious.
You should never say no to this..

1064
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,840
Its Diwali..
Tell him

1065
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,040
Keep it.. Its the same 500 that
I picked from that drunk woman

1066
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,040
Lets leave..

1067
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,480
Nobody saw me do it

1068
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,080
- It's already 3am..
- Yes let's leave

1069
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,120
I've been saying
for the longest time..

1070
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,800
- You are leaving?
- Yes, I think we should..

1071
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,760
Thanks for coming man,
So nice to see you.

1072
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,000
Nice to meet you..

1073
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,360
Stay in touch

1074
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,240
- Bye! nice meeting you..
- Bye, happy Diwali

1075
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,760
Sorry man.. about the food
- But the whiskey was great

1076
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,120
Just have a bite on your
way back if you find something

1077
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,720
- I ate before coming here
- So sorry about this food situation

1078
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,920
Don't worry, it's okay. Bye!

1079
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,120
Do me a favour guys. Take out
the garbage bags on your way out..

1080
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,520
Sunil, the garbage guy
will take it out in the morning

1081
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,800
- Not good to let it be here all night
- Its okay, we'll take it out

1082
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,000
We clean up after him
even at the office

1083
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,880
- Bye guys, thanks..
- Bye

1084
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,920
Thanks so much for taking the bags..

1085
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,160
Thank you for tonight

1086
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,720
- Happy Diwali
- To you too..

1087
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,960
You have a lovely house

1088
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,720
Goodnight.

1089
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:07,920
Chhaya..

1090
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,920
If I had a little more money,
I'd have won big time

1091
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,600
- How much did you lose?
- 1800

1092
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,480
Not bad..

1093
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,000
If you had more money,
you'd have lost more

1094
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,160
Fate is on my side..

1095
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,720
- You would lose, ask me why?
- Why?

1096
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,480
Because you play like a gambler.
For entertainment.

1097
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,920
He doesn't play to win,
he plays for the excitement.

1098
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:49,880
What's wrong with that?

1099
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,560
- Because you're an optimist.
- How that a flaw?

1100
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,480
He is so optimistic that he
can not see the truth of his cards

1101
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,280
That's a good line sir,
for my next book..

1102
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,040
Dont put me in it, okay?

1103
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,440
That man who came
from your office today

1104
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,480
Naresh?

1105
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,200
Earlier in the day, Anand..

1106
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,680
Let these guys go, we'll talk

1107
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,800
You are so full of shit.

1108
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,480
How can you even look me in the eye?

1109
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,840
What have I done?

1110
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,840
Can you stop pretending,
for one minute?

1111
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,760
What happened?

1112
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,560
Go on, tell your friends
what happened

1113
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,760
Let them leave,
we can talk about this later..

1114
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,720
Guys, I think all
of you should go home now

1115
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,000
Nobody is going.. stay!

1116
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,480
Malti..

1117
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,520
Malti? Not butterfly?

1118
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,280
I'm not your butterfly?

1119
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,080
Call me butterfly Sunil, one more time.

1120
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,400
- Call me butterfly..
- Malti

1121
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,880
Call me butterfly! No!

1122
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,240
What happened, Malti?

1123
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,520
Yogesh, shut the door.

1124
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,800
There is no need.

1125
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,960
Am I being hysterical?
I'm absolutely fine

1126
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,320
Malti?

1127
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,200
You were so right Paro.
I should have listened to you

1128
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,320
I shouldn't have trusted a man.
What's wrong with me?

1129
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,840
Malti, whatever it is.. its going
to be okay, we'll sort it out.

1130
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,160
Yes, its okay, you are right.
Its no big deal

1131
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,680
Everything will be fine..

1132
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,680
He's only been cheating
on me this entire time.

1133
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,560
But that is okay.
It happens in all marriages

1134
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:25,280
But what I can not believe, is that
you had the gall to call her to our house

1135
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,360
You invited her to my party

1136
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,880
I didn't invite her,
she came on her own.

1137
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,600
I swear

1138
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,800
Who?

1139
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:37,840
Chhaya

1140
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,320
- You said it's over?
- It's over

1141
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,280
Malti I am sorry.. guys..

1142
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,360
It happened

1143
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,080
What do you mean it happened?

1144
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,680
You had nothing to do with it?
It happened by itself?

1145
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,520
Is there anything else I don't know?

1146
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,440
Any other butterflies that
I don't know about? Tell me now..

1147
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,880
Malti, I said I am sorry

1148
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,840
Malti I know its hard..
but it will be okay

1149
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:17,960
It's okay?

1150
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,360
Yeah it's okay..

1151
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,880
No I am not saying what
he did is okay. Its not.

1152
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:30,160
He has broken your trust.
He has been selfish..

1153
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,520
Selfish..

1154
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,480
You have no idea
how selfish this man is.

1155
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,960
Shall I tell them Sunil?

1156
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,000
Sunil shall I tell them about the..?

1157
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,280
- Actually let me show them
- Malti, don't!

1158
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,360
- Malti are you nuts?
- This is how selfish this man is..

1159
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,280
- What happened?
- There's a dead body in the house

1160
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,000
He has killed a man,
and he has called all of you here

1161
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,760
- Who is this?
- Chhaya's husband

1162
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,680
I didn't kill him..

1163
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,600
Its not true. I didn't kill him.

1164
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,560
He found out. He came over,
and killed himself

1165
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,080
You have to believe me.. Joshi

1166
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,480
- Yogesh, you think I'd kill a man?
- I don't know

1167
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,520
- Rahul..
- What have you gotten us into Sunil?

1168
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,440
Tell me something Sunil,
there's a dead body in your house.

1169
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,680
Didn't you think you should cancel the party?
Not once did it pass your mind?

1170
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,440
- It was too late
- What do you mean it was too late?

1171
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,920
Joshi had got 5 kilo
of mutton already..

1172
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,040
- What?
- Mutton?

1173
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,160
You could eat that mutton
for the next 10 days for all I care.

1174
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,200
You got us all into this
shit because of Joshi's mutton?

1175
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,040
- I didn't mean to..
- You did, you ass!

1176
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,760
Malti you were absolutely right.

1177
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,600
You are the most sick
and selfish man in the world

1178
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,360
Last time you cancelled the party
because you had an upset stomach.

1179
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,040
And now this?

1180
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,200
- Guys it just happened..
- Just happened..There we go again.

1181
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,520
Sunil!

1182
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,200
You know what, screw you all man,
screw each one of you.

1183
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,520
Screw you Sunil- and you, and you..

1184
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,520
And you, you get up

1185
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,400
We need to decide
what is to be done now?

1186
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,280
Sheetal shut the door please.
And somebody call the police

1187
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,600
- We can't call the police
- Why not, if you are innocent?

1188
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,440
They will never believe me

1189
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,600
What were you planning to do with it?
Live with it forever?

1190
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:29,120
I thought once the party is over,
I'd think of something

1191
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,000
But its good in a way
that all of you are here

1192
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,920
Sorry, I am not a part of this.
Friendship is in one place- this is murder

1193
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,760
Yogesh don't leave me, buddy.
You know people.

1194
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,000
I'm not your undertaker

1195
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,520
You bastard!
You bastard! I'll kill you..

1196
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,200
You killed Raghav.
You know who Raghav is?

1197
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Chhaya's husband?
- To hell with Chhaya.

1198
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,400
He is my publisher

1199
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,080
I didn't kill him brother..

1200
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,840
Bastard you killed my publisher

1201
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,200
- I did not kill him.. He killed himself
- What do I care?

1202
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,520
Why did you have to
go and sleep with Chhaya?

1203
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,480
Why couldn't you sleep
with somebody else?

1204
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,720
- Rahul, it happened..
- It happened, did it?

1205
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,920
I will kill you!!!

1206
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,080
- Just happened..
- Who is Chhaya?

1207
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,960
Dhruva..

1208
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,120
Dhruva, wake up-
there is a dead man

1209
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,000
Who died?

1210
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,880
I don't know, somebody.

1211
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,320
- Where is he?
- In the other room

1212
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,960
- Like, shot in the head
- Wow

1213
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,160
Have some water

1214
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:57,000
I am really sorry Rahul,
I didn't know he was your publisher

1215
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,680
I had one chance..

1216
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,720
one chance in four years,
and you did this

1217
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,840
Rahul I'm really sorry

1218
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,120
You're sorry?
Show me how sorry you are?

1219
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,520
Take this..

1220
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,560
- What's the matter with you?
- Take this.

1221
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,240
Do what he did

1222
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,760
You are the cause of every
one's misery- his, yours, mine

1223
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,760
I don't know how much
more pain you are going to cause

1224
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,800
Send it out to the universe, right?

1225
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,480
This is what the
universe sent back to me

1226
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,320
- I don't know what you asked for.
- Just shut up.

1227
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,360
No more of your mumbo jumbo

1228
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,080
Sheetal lets leave..

1229
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,200
Rahul brother,
you can't leave me like this

1230
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,880
I am leaving. But before I go
I'm going to call the police

1231
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,560
Rahul don't do that..

1232
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,960
What are you going to tell them?

1233
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,880
I am going to tell them there has been
a murder here. Is that okay?

1234
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:50,000
Rahul, your finger prints
are on the gun- and on the trunk.

1235
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,080
- And yours
- What the fuck, bro

1236
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,240
What a creep you are!

1237
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,240
What do you expect? I am
asking for your help, as a friend

1238
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,200
This is asking for help? This?

1239
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,080
Can we decide what to do about this?

1240
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,880
Mama.. in Breaking Bad they
use acid to dissolve the body

1241
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,840
Vivan!

1242
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,720
Acid!

1243
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:23,440
A man who used to laugh, love,
cook- and in the end its just acid?

1244
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,520
- Joshi get a hold on your self
- What does it all mean?

1245
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,600
He is dead..

1246
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,040
- Joshi, I didn't do it..
- I know. That is what is really sad.

1247
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:43,040
He killed himself. Can you imagine how
much pain there must be in his life?

1248
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,400
Joshi he is in a happier place now

1249
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,960
How do you know?

1250
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,320
How do you know that?

1251
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,720
What if he is still unhappy?

1252
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,640
All you smart people,
you have words..

1253
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,960
..but no feelings

1254
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,160
I hate all of you

1255
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,760
Please Joshi.
Stop making this about yourself

1256
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,200
This is no time to be emotional

1257
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,520
He is dead, we are alive.
He doesn't have problems, we do.

1258
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,280
He doesn't have to
go to work tomorrow, I do

1259
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,840
Quite frankly he is the most selfish
man I've ever met, not you Sunil

1260
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,360
Everybody has problems-
Everybody is suffering.

1261
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,000
I don't go blowing my brains out

1262
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,120
- That too on Diwali night.
- And in somebody else's house

1263
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,480
Who does that, man?

1264
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,320
What about this unfortunate soul?

1265
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,120
Unfortunate? He?
What about us?

1266
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,400
He escaped.
We are the ones trapped

1267
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,880
He is my friend.
Not you guys..

1268
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,600
I just want to hug him..
I feel so close to him

1269
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,240
- Joshi what are you doing?
- I just want to sleep..

1270
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,000
Go inside and sleep

1271
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:53,320
- Joshi what are you doing?
- I want to hug this guy

1272
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,840
I want to feel close to him..
I understand him

1273
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,920
Stop being ridiculous

1274
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,280
Joshi! will you stop it..

1275
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:06,640
- I just want to feel close to him..
- Joshi stop it

1276
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,440
Sheetal let him be

1277
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,680
Why can't you all just stop this?
What are you doing?

1278
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,960
There is a dead body here and you all are
just crying and thinking about yourselves

1279
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,520
Sheetal stop being hysterical

1280
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,440
Of course I am going to be hysterical,

1281
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,280
How can you be so calm?
What's wrong with YOU?

1282
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,120
Guys can we decide
whats to be done?

1283
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,640
She is right..

1284
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:41,800
Sunil?

1285
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:47,680
Malti?

1286
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:51,000
I want him out of
the house, that is all

1287
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:55,000
Yeah, but where? You can't
just dump a body out on the road..

1288
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,120
Anybody has any bright ideas,
speak now

1289
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:04,160
Vivan, no acid- no knives..
Any other ideas?

1290
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,760
Railway tracks

1291
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,560
When you have it,
you don't realise its value..

1292
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,320
but after its gone,
you know what it really meant

1293
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,320
Sunil, is it okay if we skip?

1294
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,000
Are you nuts?
I am not exactly mad about doing this.

1295
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,360
Either we all go, or nobody..

1296
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,000
Get the car Sunil, will you?

1297
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,880
Don't you touch me.
You are a curse

1298
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,320
- Baby promise me something
- Yeah?

1299
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,880
Don't ever cheat on me

1300
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,560
I'd rather die..

1301
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,960
- Oh shit!
- What happened?

1302
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,000
I left my cooking vessel
over there.. Tch!

1303
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,720
- You haven't been cleaning the car lately
- No sir, just yesterday..

1304
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,680
Do a good job of it today

1305
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,760
Sir, Happy Diwali..

1306
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,280
"Careful now..."

1307
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,760
"these are trying times"

1308
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,840
"Careful"

1309
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:34,480
"of these blurring lines"

1310
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,200
"What's gone.."

1311
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:44,800
"is not coming back"

1312
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:53,680
"And the present is
thick with uncertainty"

1313
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,240
"The darkness has taken up tenancy"

1314
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,520
"Shutting out all light with
seeming permanency"

1315
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,880
"The night is faking
it with false promises"

1316
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,800
"Truth is, truth is the morning isn't coming"

1317
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:19,080
"Careful now.."

1318
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,400
"don't be lost"

1319
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:54,120
"My heart feels empty"

1320
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,800
"But maybe you're close"

1321
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,600
"Is it just me on my own"

1322
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,960
"Or are you close"

1323
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,080
"It's hard to say.."

1324
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,760
"Whether the heart's just bruised up"

1325
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,280
"Or timid and afraid"

1326
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,040
"Some moment somewhere is stuck"

1327
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:40,200
"Cold and frozen and un-melting"

1328
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:44,680
"Your love is a force of habit for me"

1329
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:47,640
"it doesn't leave me "

1330
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,320
"Careful now.."

1331
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,120
"don't lose the way.."
