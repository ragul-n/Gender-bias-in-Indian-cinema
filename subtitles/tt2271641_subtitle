1
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,537
I am here in Trafalgar Square...

2
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,868
It has just been reported that a
bomb has gone off here 10 minutes ago...

3
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,868
The whole country is
in a state of shock.

4
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,405
This is the worst hit
since the 9/11 incident...

5
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,548
...in the United States of America...

6
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,411
This is the biggest terrorist
attack that has shaken London.

7
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,282
The Government is doing all that it
can to keep the citizens calm and safe

8
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,388
This morning...

9
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:47,890
Amazing Grace...

10
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:53,864
How sweet the sound...

11
00:02:54,407 --> 00:03:05,579
That saved a wretch like me...

12
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:18,289
I once was lost, but now I'm found...

13
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,343
What is this song?

14
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,606
It's an MGR Song...

15
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,942
"MGR"

16
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,476
...Who is "MGR"?

17
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,348
Hey!! What do you mean by who is MGR?

18
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,822
We know who Arnold is...
Don't you know who MGR is?

19
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,320
If you were to ask this
question in Tamil Nadu...

20
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,327
You will be in a soup...

21
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,624
What is he saying?

22
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,822
In this song...?

23
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,702
If you know, you know,
you can take on the world...

24
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,337
Stop! Stop! This is where I get out...

25
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,807
15 Pounds...

26
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,242
Sir, no job, no money, no house...

27
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,709
I want to go to my homeland...

28
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,644
Please give me a Tip...

29
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,479
You know, you know,
you can win the world...

30
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,715
MGR said...

31
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:17,820
Thank you!

32
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,668
Sir... Taxi...?

33
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,008
Sir... Where do you have to go?

34
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,677
I need to go to Leicester Square...

35
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,515
Are you a Tamilian?

36
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,390
Did you take notice, Sir...?

37
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,687
It's our people who
spend money to hire a Taxi...

38
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,027
People from here walk to every place,
as if they were Diabetic...

39
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,029
This is money they
brought back from our place,

40
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,407
why can't they spend it?

41
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,871
Misers!!

42
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,041
Sir... here's the
address you want to go to...

43
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,545
Please finish your work and
come back... l'll wait for you...

44
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:13,936
What...?

45
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,377
Who are you?

46
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,615
Who are you?

47
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,485
You!!

48
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,488
I've got nothing to do with it...

49
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,961
Leave me... Please...

50
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,497
I've got nothing to do with it... Please...

51
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,403
Hey, Mate! Move, your bloody car!

52
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,540
Hey!! Wait, Man!

53
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,801
I'll come in this direction!
You go in that direction!

54
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,136
Which direction?

55
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,673
Maniratnam's Direction! Look at him!

56
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,143
What the hell is going on?!

57
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,984
What do you want?

58
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,148
My God!

59
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,647
Hey!! Hey!!

60
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,822
Watch it! How dare you touch
the car, you bald fellow!!

61
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,430
What?
- Are you some big shot from Piccadilly?

62
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,531
What are you saying to me?

63
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,828
If you dare to, touch me!! Come on!

64
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,662
What are you trying to do...?

65
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,674
A body! Body! A dead body!
- Oh! My God!

66
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,572
Sir, there was one taxi at that time...

67
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,598
Tell me...

68
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,615
This is the dead body...

69
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,612
Coming from the terrace...

70
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,911
Coming... Coming...
Coming... Coming... Fall down...

71
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,756
The dead body came
crashing down like this...

72
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,619
He fell dead, on that car...

73
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,091
That's all your honour...

74
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,624
What is he saying?

75
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,267
Doesn't he know English?

76
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,531
Call Mr. Veerakathy...
- Yes, Sir...

77
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,935
Mr. Veerakathy...

78
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,011
I am Veerakathy, (Brave Sword)...

79
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,945
Sir, I am Sathyan, (Promise)

80
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,683
Sir, Tamil Policemen have names like
'Walter Vetrivel' and 'Alex Pandian'...

81
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,655
You seem to have a queer name...

82
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,562
Tell me... What happened?

83
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,030
Sir, this is the dead body...

84
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,306
The dead body is
coming from the terrace...

85
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,674
It's coming... coming... coming...

86
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,676
The body is going, Sir...

87
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,973
It is fine; you can narrate in Tamil...

88
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,047
I am not kidding, Sir...
I am speaking the truth...

89
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,842
I was waiting for the customer...

90
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,314
I have not even collected my money...

91
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,688
It is 26 pounds...

92
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,321
If I were to convert
that to Indian currency,

93
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,313
it would be... 86x26 = 2236...

94
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,156
Who is that customer?

95
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,327
Where did you pick him up from?

96
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,989
Why are you grilling me
as if I am a Mafia Don...?

97
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,323
I am a Taxi driver;

98
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,702
Hundreds of people use my car each day...

99
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,703
Sir, I have to attend to a
customer in the evening...

100
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,708
I will gift your Police
Station with something small...

101
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,003
Please get me out of this Case...

102
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,347
Take his address and leave him...

103
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,715
Thank you, Sir...

104
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,755
Mr. Veerakathy, he is the
only suspect in the case,

105
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,014
Why did you let him go?

106
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,748
He's not the suspect;
he's just a witness, Allan...

107
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,723
So, are you saying it's a suicide?

108
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:31,861
Who is handling the Autopsy?

109
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,727
Please rise for Morning has broken...

110
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:40,771
Morning has broken,
like the first morning...

111
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,775
Blackbird has spoken,
like the first bird...

112
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,913
Praise for the singing...

113
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,379
Praise for the morning...

114
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:35,259
Morning has broken,
like the first morning...

115
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,804
Mr. Veerakathy... here's
Jordan's autopsy report...

116
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,946
It's a murder...

117
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,112
Excuse me...
- Yes...

118
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,445
How do you say this is a murder?

119
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:02,852
As per your Autopsy report,

120
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,455
what is the time of Jordan's death?

121
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
10:13 at night...

122
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:07,718
As per the evidence report...

123
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,120
...what's the time seen on the watch...

124
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,818
...after it fell from the top...?

125
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,955
10:25...

126
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,825
There's no chance the corpse would
have walked to its death, is there?

127
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,139
Doctor, you guys close the case
when you begin to suspect something...

128
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,842
We begin the case only
when we suspect something...

129
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,006
Tell me, dear...

130
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,218
Where are you, Dad? It's gonna start...

131
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:39,982
And Miss London 2012 is,
Ms. Sarah Vinayakam...

132
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,920
Who are you...?

133
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,527
Like a beautiful apparition...

134
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,261
You appear in front of
my eyes and then vanish...

135
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,936
As your feet touch the earth...

136
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,538
Flowers blossom there...

137
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,538
Like the moon...

138
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,533
You wander...

139
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,276
Casting shadows...

140
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,208
You create a storm...

141
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,951
With your black hair, you cast a web...

142
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,919
With your gaze, you kill me...

143
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,141
When she looks at the mirror,

144
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,615
It will say she is poetry...

145
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,285
And before anyone else can look at it,

146
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,016
it will cover itself...

147
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,629
The creator gathered
up a million flowers...

148
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,365
And pouring honey into each,
he created you...

149
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,163
She is an angel... With red lips...

150
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,033
With a glance,

151
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,004
She can raise the earth's temperature...

152
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,304
She is a sparkling star,
with a face like a lotus...

153
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:18,481
To one's eyes, she is an angel...

154
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,016
Who are you...?

155
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,659
Like a beautiful apparition...

156
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,326
You appear in front of
my eyes and then vanish...

157
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,058
As your feet touch the earth...

158
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,068
Flowers blossom there...

159
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,537
Like the moon... You wander

160
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,343
Casting shadows... You create a storm...

161
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,674
With your black hair, you cast a web...

162
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:55,050
With your gaze, you kill me...

163
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:04,355
Contestants for the 52nd
Ms. England Pageant 2012 are

164
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,964

From London, Sarah Vinayakam...

168
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,118
Sarah Vinayakam...
Who is this Tamil girl?

169
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,117
Her mother is an
English Christian from

170
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,584
London and her father
a Thanjavur Brahmin...

171
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,390
This angel was born to them...
- Nice...

172
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,092
Yes.
- Let's go...

173
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,730
Congrats, Ms. England...
- Ms. London...

174
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,598
"Ms. London" is the past...

175
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,092
"Ms. England" is the future...

176
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,099
We are "Future"...
Future Modeling Agency...

177

181
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,144
Let's meet up... ok?

182
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,143
Why are you wondering?
You are Ms. England...

183
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,144
Ok... Thanks...

184
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,577
It's ok...

185
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,120
Yes...

186
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,119
Hi! I am, Rod...
- Hi!

187
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,588
This is my beautiful girlfriend...
- Hello!

188
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,420
My name is Veronica...

189
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,426
I think she would be an
amazing beauty for your agency...

190
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,130
What do you think?

191
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,129
No Future... Sorry, Buddy...
- What?

192
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,669
It's Anisa... Because she can't hear,
she is trying to feel it...

193
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,596
Nice...

194
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,771
This is not a profile meant for Miss UK...

195
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,605
He means to say this profile is
suited for Miss World and Miss Universe...

196
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,671
But, to win...

197
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,779
...you need more than beauty and brains...

198
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,472
What else do you need?

199
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,310
You need to be a little crafty...

200
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,686
Ok, start!

201
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,792
Sarah, smile a little more please...

202
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,329
Cut!

203
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,163
Sir, what do you want for breakfast?

204
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,362
Sarah, what do you want to eat?

205
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,370
Chicken burger...

206
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,336
2 Chicken Burgers... Go!
- Ok, Sir...

207
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,473
Smile!

208
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,243
Open!

209
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,581
Is that ok?

210
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,348
Ok!

211
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,477
Ok, Over...

212
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,361
Stop!

213
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,192
Stop!...

214
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:00,829
Ok...

215
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,196
Ok?
- Lovely - Ok!

216
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,382
Target, number 4... Jessica...

217
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,517
Owner of Golf and Country Club...

218
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,384
Kent...

219
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,557
This is one of the
best churches in London...

220
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,559
There's an old age home and
orphanage right next to it...

221
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,891
If we manage to take pictures here,

222
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,767
your social profile
will seem very impressive...

223
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,765
Will they give us
permission to take pictures...?

224
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,564
My sister is a
caretaker at the old age home...

225
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:46,244
I've taken permission saying we've are going to
do social service for an entire day... - Good!

226
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,444
Father, this is my brother,
Satish and Sarah...

227
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,911
Hello, everyone!
- Hi, Father! - Hello father...

228
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,720
It's very nice that you young
people volunteered to work for us...

229
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,556
Ok, ready... Smile...

230
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,431
That's fine... Next...

231
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,799
The next one... Smile...
- That's great... Next...

232
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,268
Ok, get up...

233
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,809
Excuse me, Move please...

234
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,910
What is going on...?
- Bring the next one...

235
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,475
This is my Church... My son...
- He's calling...

236
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,741
My son...
- Hi father...

237
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,914
Man... What's going on?
- Amen...

238
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,454
Dilsha... Dilsha...
- Father...

239
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,294
Cut! Cut! Cut!

240
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,826
Sarah... Why are you looking
there... you need to look here... ok?

241
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,762
Look here, this is the Camera...
- Ok?

242
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,595
Turn that guy around...

243
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,609
Get him to turn around...

244
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,847
Is he getting angry? Turn him around!

245
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,475
Oh my god! It's him!

246
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,310
We're done for the day.
Be back tomorrow.

247
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,859
Father... Amen...

248
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,321
Get out!!

249
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,326
Kenny...

250
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,964
Kenny, are you alright?

251
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,966
Dilsha, get everybody out of here!

252
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,864
What are you guys doing?

253
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,664
You asked me
permission to do social service...

254
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,000
Not only are you
disrespecting a holy place,

255
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,411
you've pushed a
visually challenged man down...

256
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,409
Why on earth was I scared of this guy...!

257
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,638
I'm so sorry...

258
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,815
We were clicking some pictures
for a beauty pageant profile...

259
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,988
It was our fault...

260
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,822
I can't see the beauty
you are talking about...

261
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:55,437
In my eyes, neither your
people nor you are beautiful...

262
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,446
Hello, Sir... How are you?

263
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,381
Don't you recognize me?

264
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,918
It's me... I dropped you
at Leicester Square...

265
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,591
Do you know what happened that day?

266
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,556
There was a dead body that
dropped from the terrace...

267
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,458
Coming... Coming... Coming...

268
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,858
I fled in fear...

269
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,690
The Police took me for an enquiry...

270
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,571
Tell me, Sir... Will
murderers look like us?

271
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,039
Will they look like us?

272
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,570
I forgot to take money from
you amidst all that tension...

273
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,878
I forgot to take money from you, Sir...

274
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,740
I am trying to tell you
this as delicately as I can...

275
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,475
...and here you are
shying away from talking...

276
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,584
I need to go to Kent...

277
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,053
Golf and Country Club...

278
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,416
To Kent...?

279
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,050
40 miles...

280
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,958
The old dues plus new business...

281
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,723
Sir!!! It's a kill!!

282
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,769
Sir, why are you settling
dues now and sending me away?

283
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,604
I would have to head back alone...

284
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,774
Not just a corpse,

285
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,746
even if the building were to come
crashing down, I will not go away this time...

286
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,749
Finish up your work and come back...

287
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,512
I'll wait for you patiently...

288
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,624
All the best, Sir...

289
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,085
It's dark, be careful...

290
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,783
Peter...

291
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,123
Peter... Stop playing now...

292
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,124
I know it...

293
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,132
Who's that?

294
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,975
It's a Ghost!
Somebody help me! It's a Ghost!

295
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,812
Help!! Help me someone!

296
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,859
Sorry, I am waiting for a customer...

297
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,006
Good Morning Sir...

298
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,716
What is it, Sir...?
You've travelled this far...

299
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,717
Do you have any
relatives who stay close by...?

300
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,719
When did you come here?
- Last night...

301
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,089
It was very cold... Couldn't handle it...

302
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,764
That's why I pulled over to
a corner and went to sleep...

303
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,728
What were you doing all through night?

304
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,195
I was thinking about the
best drink to beat the cold...

305
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,571
Come on, Sir... I told you I
came here for a customer...

306
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,037
I am waiting for him...

307
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,213
Is that your customer?
- Is he here...?

308
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:30,777
What are you thinking, Sir?

309
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,785
Am I a taxi driver or
a Mortuary van driver?

310
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,787
You grab hold of me
whenever you find a dead body...

311
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,586
What were you doing there
in the middle of the night?

312
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,128
I was counting the
number of teeth an ant has...

313
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,924
How many times do I tell you?
I was waiting for a customer...

314
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,898
You gave me the same
answer even the last time...

315
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,935
You asked me the same
question even the last time...

316
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,664
Ask me different questions and
I will give you different answers...

317
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,807
Who is that customer?

318
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,808
The same man from the last time...

319
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,606
Did he have anything in his hands...?

320
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,146
You mean, like nail
polish or body paint...

321
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,147
Shut up! I meant weapons...

322
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,819
There was nothing like that...

323
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,943
How did he look?

324
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,625
He looks grumpy... Kind of like you...

325
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,257
How does the man look...?

326
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,629
Are you looking for a
match for your daughter?

327
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,626
You are asking so many
questions about him...

328
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,094
I told you...
- Wait... Sir, Please... Wait...

329
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,967
You, Idiot... he is
talking about his looks...

330
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,174
So, you are talking about
his physical appearance...

331
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,808
Why do you have to tie
me up to ask me this?

332
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,945
Let go of me and I will tell you...

333
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:31,644
A little bit to the right...

334
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:40,820
Right... Ok... Draw a circle... Here...

335
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:42,959
Turn it around... Ya... Ok! Perfect...

336
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,662
Where's the Head?

337
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,664
He must be busy at work...

338
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,132
I can't recall his
face however much I try...

339
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,671
I've seen him mostly in the dark...

340
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,139
I only remember the
clothes he was wearing...

341
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,834
I can tell you one thing for sure...

342
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,140
Even if you run a search on Google,
you won't to find a good boy like me...

343
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,014
I really don't know anything...

344
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:11,689
If you see him again or if
he gets in to your taxi again,

345
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,981
You must inform me immediately...

346
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,682
Ok?
- Sir...

347
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,220
Similarly, if you were to
see him or get any information...

348
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,897
let me know immediately...

349
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,225
He has taken my taxi twice
but has not paid me for it...

350
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,901
It's close to 150 pounds...

351
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,007
Convert that to our currency,
even if you multiply that by 86...

352
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:35,009
We will now sing Hymn number 661...

353
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:49,387
The Lord's my shepherd... I'll not want...

354
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:56,927
He makes me lie down in pastures green...

355
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:04,734
He leads me in quiet waters...

356
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,209
My sincere apologies, Father...

357
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,940
I didn't mean to hurt anyone...

358
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,915
My dear, it's not your fault... I know that...
- We understand... It's Ok...

359
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:24,756
Kenny...

360
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,299
I came to... I am sorry for...

361
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,252
I am so sorry...

362
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,085
This happened because of me...

363
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:03,127
If he has any friends or relatives,
ask them to come...

364
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,132
Dad, he doesn't have anyone...

365
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,339
He's an orphan...
- Oh!

366
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,340
All things bright and beautiful...

367
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,138
All creatures great and small...

368
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:20,147
All things wise and wonderful...

369
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:24,287
The lord god made them all...

370
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,821
Almighty God, please return Kenny to us...

371
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,824
Relieve him of his suffering and pain,

372
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,996
Let us enjoy his
wonderful music again... Amen...

373
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,302
As long as there is love, no
one in this world is an orphan...

374
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,316
Kenny, you are absolutely fine...

375
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,381
Can I go?

376
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,018
Greetings, Doctor!

377
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,145
You've changed the room...

378
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,056
I searched the whole hospital...

379
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,317
One can find the murderer,
but can't find you...

380
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,926
Hello, Mr. Veerakathy...

381
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,325
This is my daughter, Sarah...

382
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:08,530
Hi...
- Hi...

383
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,491
Sarah's friend, Kenny...

384
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,502
Hello! I am Veerakathy, (Brave sword)...

385
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,171
Hello!

386
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,171
Oh! Sorry... He can't see...
- Oh!

387
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,955
Ok, Kenny, see you later...

388
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,953
Ok, get well soon!

389
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,054
Mr. Veerakathy...

390
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,192
Please delete that photo...

391
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,427
Sorry, Sir...

392
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,965
He doesn't like being photographed...

393
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,429
I am sorry...

394
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,374
Thanks...

395
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,076
Mr. Veerakathy, just as we thought...

396
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,117
The death points are
affected in Cathy's body...

397
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,911
He is very intelligent...

398
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,250
He has made it difficult to tell
if it's a murder or a suicide...

399
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,551
What's his name...?
- Who?

400
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,927
Your daughter's friend...
- Kenny...

401
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,094
Kenny...

402
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,008
He looks grumpy... Kind of like you...

403
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,406
He doesn't laugh even
when you crack a joke...

404
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,277
I can't recall his
face however much I try...

405
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,418
I've seen him mostly in the dark...

406
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,120
I only remember the
clothes he was wearing...

407
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,956
Welcome back to the Church, Kenny...

408
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,133
Kenny, Sarah's such a wonderful person

409
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,965
You know, Sarah sings so well,
Kenny... We missed you...

410
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,507
Sarah's one of us now...

411
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,975
Sarah filled in for you the last 3 days...

412
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,310
I could give them
every other happiness...

413
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,988
But couldn't give them your music...

414
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,157
Will anyone walk blindfolded...?

415
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,722
Tell me, Kenny...

416
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,394
Thankfully, I was at home, else...

417
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,430
Who do we have to care for us?

418
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,637
All things bright and beautiful...

419
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,773
All creatures great and small...

420
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,645
All things wise and wonderful...

421
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:19,111
The lord god made them all...

422
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,112
We are not orphans, Dad...

423
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,122
Bye, This way... Get in...

424
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:36,196
Kenny, please take care of
Sarah... God Bless you my child...

425
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,765
Bye!!!

426
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,504
You are very beautiful...

427
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,163
You are very beautiful...

428
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:27,475
Will you be there, when I need you?

429
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:32,480
Will you be there, when I want you?

430
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:37,521
Oh, will you be there, I can feel you...

431
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:42,859
Oh, will you be there, I love you...

432
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:47,362
I became beautiful, because of you...

433
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:52,375
I became a woman, being close to you...

434
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,670
I am smitten by your smile...

435
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:02,683
And today, I am someone else...

436
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,715
Is this a painless illness...?

437
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,787
Are you the one who
inflicted this on me...?

438
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,725
Recalling the past is special...

439
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:57,333
But will what I hope for,
happen in the future...?

440
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:01,443
When your fingers... And my fingers touch...

441
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,479
I am drenched in love...

442
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:09,482
Will you be there, when I need you?

443
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,282
Will you be there, when I want you?

444
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:19,293
Oh, will you be there, I can feel you...

445
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,593
Oh, will you be there, I love you...

446
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,761
I became beautiful, because of you...

447
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,767
I became a woman, being close to you...

448
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:39,380
I am smitten by your smile...

449
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:44,316
And today, I am someone else...

450
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,396
Cheers!
- Cheers!

451
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,490
Born to an English mother
and a Tamil father,

452
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:58,458
Ms. Sarah Vinayakam is the first
Tamil girl to win the Ms. London title...

453
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:05,093
With this, she has made all
Tamilians worldwide, proud...

454
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:10,505
With her good conduct and finer qualities
she has further adorned Tamil Culture...

455
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,605
Kenny... Kenny...

456
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,510
Sarah told me you were coming...
I was expecting you...

457
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,476
The Function is this way...
Come with me...

458
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,377
The Tamil Association wishes
her for a great future ahead

459
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,485
and for winning the upcoming
Ms. England pageant...

460
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,651
We now present to you,
Ms. Sarah Vinayakam...

461
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,120
She will address the gathering...

462
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,854
Greetings to everyone...

463
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,860
Though I was born in Britain,

464
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,796
I must thank my father for
raising me as a Tamil girl...

465
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,664
He taught me Tamil
culture and tradition...

466
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:48,140
Even though Tamilians are spread
across Srilanka, Malaysia, Singapore

467
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,513
and other places, it is
Tamil that unites us...

468
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,817
Everyone thinks you are going to win
the upcoming Ms. England pageant...

469
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,147
What do you have to say about that?

470
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,547
I must thank people who think that...

471
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,885
If you become Ms. England, what
would you set your eyes on next...?

472
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,563
Would it be social service or would
it be Beauty pageants and Fashion...?

473
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,163
My vision...

474
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:15,001
The most awful thing in the world
is the inability to see...

475
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:22,171
I would like to be the light in the life
of a person who is unable to see...

476
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,675
Can you tell us who that person is...?

477
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,682
His name is Kenny...

478
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,452
He is right here...

479
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:06,079
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, please...

480
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,889
Please... just listen...

481
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,489
I have not taken this decision
out of sympathy for you...

482
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,729
I truly...

483
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,965
Hey, you, listen...

484
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,637
I want you out of this competition...

485
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,601
Get your hands off me...

486
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:28,973
My girlfriend is going
to win... You will lose...

487
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,771
I said get your hands off me!

488
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,915
Where did you get this attitude from...?

489
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,640
Is it because you are beautiful...

490
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,513
or is it because of your boyfriend...?

491
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,653
Talk to me... Don't touch him!

492
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,118
Oh! If I touch him, you get angry?

493
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,116
What you can do...?

494
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:42,992
Kenny, go away...

495
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,785
He's Blind... do you get that...?

496
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,792
Why don't you leave him?

497
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,623
Do you see now...?

498
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,767
See what is going to happen to him!!

499
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:53,667
Rip him off!

500
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,768
What will you do?
- Please go, Kenny...

501
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,330
I understand everything now...

502
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,333
You are just like the
Policemen back home...

503
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,072
If you can't find the real culprit,

504
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,338
You find some innocent guy
and heap charges on him...

505
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,614
You have a strong
connection with the murders,

506
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,716
Tell us the truth... Who is it?

507
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,354
Please come, Sir... Look
at what is happening...

508
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,087
They've spared the villain but
are grilling the clown instead...

509
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,848
I am harmless...

510
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,027
I told you even then that
I don't know anything...

511
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,092
Sir, give me some time...

512
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,092
If we thrash him a few times,
he will be out with the truth...

513
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,095
Even if you thrash him several times,
you will not get anything out of him.

514
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,202
Sir, this guy seems kinder; You
want me beaten several times...

515
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,766
Go to Benedict Hospital...

516
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,737
Dr. Vinayakam will handover a Report...

517
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,870
All the murders look similar...

518
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,748
It must be the same person...

519
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,050
Who is the culprit...?

520
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,112
Why would he do it...?

521
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,047
What is the motive...

522
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,126
And target...

523
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,791
The most awful thing in the
world is the inability to see...

524
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,767
The purpose of the Eye Research Foundation
is to bring light in to their lives...

525
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,089
Sir... There's no one here, Sir...

526
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,316
Shoot him, lmran!

527
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,318
I am not lmran...

528
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,490
Shivakumar,

529
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,496
Indian Police Service...

530
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,266
Welcome, Ravichandran...

531
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,900
You've upheld our Pride...

532
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,529
Shivakumar's intelligence
and valour during Operation

533
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:28,367
Night Rose, has saved the
country from great danger...

534
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,277
You've risked your life
with terrorists for 2 years...

535
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,543
...and have reinforced the
faith people have in our reign...

536
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,214
Best of luck!

537
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,049
Ya, you are right...

538
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,394
Hey!
- Welcome back, Sir...

539
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:46,927
Good show sir!

540
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,558
Sir...
- Yes...

541
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,311
It looks like an Invitation...

542
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,103
As I am back, people home

543
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,440
are probably inviting me
for some small function...

544
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,941
It's no small function...

545
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:09,953
It's a wedding...

546
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,987
A wedding...? When is it?

547
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,315
In 2 days...

548
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,422
Who is getting married?

549
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:22,958
Shivakumar... son of Nachiappan weds...

550
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,266
It's the Stop for Chokkanathapuram!!

551
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,966
Stop! Stop! Stop!

552
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,334
Bridegroom! Bridegroom!!

553
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,339
Has the Bridegroom not come...?

554
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,602
I am the Groom... Where's the Girl?

555
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,275
Why are you giving me a cheeky answer?

556
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,449
Go away!

557
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,285
Bridegroom! Bridegroom!! Bridegroom!

558
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,285
Who is the Bridegroom?

559
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,981
What's new?
I've always called you that...

560
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,022
And now, you are getting married...

561
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,126
Who said I am going to get married?

562
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,987
It's my sister who told me...
She asked me to fetch you...

563
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,360
I came to get a car for the
Reception and fetch you along the way...

564
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,364
But, you are speeding away...

565
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,002
This Wedding will not happen...

566
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,370
Bridegroom!!

567
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,131
Hey, start the car...

568
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,470
Bridegroom! Bridegroom!!

569
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,046
It will take 45 minutes
to walk the distance...

570
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,378
If we take the car, we can
rush there in 30 minutes...

571
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,316
Stop calling me "Bridegroom"...

572
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,391
Fine, Bridegroom...

573
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,322
I will not... call you "Bridegroom"...

574
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,022
Come on... Let's go by car...

575
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,032
I'll whack you...

576
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,356
I asked him to fetch the Groom,

577
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,422
but here he is, bringing
the entire village along...

578
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,688
Uncle Thambi is no ordinary man!

579
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,532
Welcome, Bridegroom
- Freshen up and we'll eat...

580
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,703
What's happening here, Mom?
- A wedding...

581
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,570
The bride's people
will be here, hurry up...

582
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,099
Who gave you a go ahead for this?

583
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,103
Who should I ask?

584
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,242
Stop that... Grate the coconut!

585
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,378
You should ask me!
- What?

586
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,241
What is that?
- Fruits...

587
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,210
Keep it there...

588
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:20,212
You should check with
me about the wedding...

589
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,111
We are getting it done...
Why should I ask you...?

590
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,979
Muruga... That should go
to the wedding hall...

591
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,381
Where are you keeping it?
- Mom...

592
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,216
Take it to the wedding hall...
- Mom, I am talking to you...

593
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,120
What is it? Whenever I ask you
about it, you always dodge me...

594
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,590
Do you know how old you are?
There's a time for everything...

595
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,463
That is why we took a call on this...

596
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,256
Mom, I've not even seen this girl...

597
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,263
No one asked me if I like her...

598
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,232
Did your grandfather see me
before getting married to me?

599
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,137
I don't want to repeat his mistake...

600
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,239
What is it now?

601
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,741
You want to see the girl, is that all?

602
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,009
Here's the photo...

603
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:54,011
I am saying I don't want a wedding
and here you are giving me a photo...

604
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,411
Why are you saying you
don't want to get married?

605
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,620
Why don't any of you understand me?

606
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,149
My job is a very risky one...
I don't even know where I will be...

607
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,280
A marriage is the last thing I need...

608
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,016
How long will you say this?

609
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,491
Your grand dad gave up his life
during the Freedom Struggle...

610
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,493
Your dad, in the Kargil War...

611
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,495
Did they not know
how things would be...?

612
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,635
That didn't mean we did not
marry nor have children...

613
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,504
Do you get married
only to have children?

614
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,639
Of course, don't you need an heir?

615
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,441
That is when you can send them to
serve the country, if the need arises...

616
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:21,644
This is the last time
I am going to ask you.

617
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,138
Do you want to see the
girl's picture before the wedding?

618
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:27,142
What are you doing here?
Aren't we getting late?

619
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,182
The girl's family is on
their way... hurry up...

620
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,614
Tell him that...

621
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,517
Bride... I won't say it...

622
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,455
Hurry up and get ready...

623
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:39,629
The wedding formalities have to begin...

624
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,794
Hey, Senthil...
- Yes, Sir...

625
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,297
Where will Uncle "Thappachey" be?

626
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:51,331
That is wrong...

627
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:52,542
I can't play around with an
innocent village girl's life

628
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,676
just because they want
me to get married...

629
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,807
What do you want to do?

630
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,307
You are one of the senior members of the
family and a village leader as well...

631
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,348
You should try and explain
it to the girl's family...

632
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:02,483
What should I say...?

633
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:06,087
Tell them about my work.
The risk involved...

634
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,791
When I head to work, I don't
even know when I am getting back...

635
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,323
I cannot meet any of the
expectations a regular girl will have...

636
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,323
I want to tell them about
all this before the wedding...

637
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,827
It's wrong...
- What is?

638
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,202
It is wrong if you
don't tell them all this...

639
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,209
Don't get anxious, see what happens...

640
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,510
Welcome, Uncle...

641
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,573
Come in, Uncle...

642
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,516
Hey, Subbaiah!!

643
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,242
I told you not to leave the door open;

644
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,511
Else, unrequired people would
step in... You don't listen...

645
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,583
They are already here...

646
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,586
You are keeping wrong company,

647
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,225
which is why you are saying
all the wrong things... Bride...

648
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,359
I won't say it...

649
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,854
It's wrong...

650
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,394
Where have you been?
The girl's family is here...

651
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,865
Have they come?

652
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,604
Note down everything...
don't blame others...

653
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,535
Come on, Bridegroom!

654
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,243
Then...
- Where are they?

655
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,278
Hey! Look who is here... Welcome!

656
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,538
Please come...
- Welcome...

657
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,410
Who are you looking at?
I am talking to you...

658
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,279
Happy to see you...
Do you know who he is?

659
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,750
He is a senior member of the family,
an advisor to the entire village...

660
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,282
He may not come across like that...

661
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,617
Well! I was told you
would be here tomorrow...

662
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,557
But you are here today,
anyway, happy to see you...

663
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,258
Why are you looking at me like that?
I am the girl's father...

664
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,299
This is my older brother...
This is my younger brother...

665
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,630
Don't just keep looking...
Serve him some sweets... - Ok sir.

666
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:33,434
Please come... let's eat some sweets...

667
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,737
What sweets are they?
- Milk sweets... - Milk sweets?

668
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,413
What are you looking at?

669
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,576
If anything were to go
wrong in this wedding,

670
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,311
we knew that would happen only
because of Uncle "Thappachey"...

671
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,581
That is why we
forewarned the Girl's family...

672
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,425
Well...

673
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,330
And this man claims to
be a Village leader!!!

674
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,430
Who is the Village leader?

675
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,328
It's been 2 years since he
was kicked out of that role...

676
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,662
No one respects him in the village...

677
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,429
And you choose to seek his help...

678
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,603
Milk sweets are enough
to keep him quiet...

679
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,472
Oh my!! Why are you doing all this?
- That is fine...

680
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,478
This is Meenakshi's mother...
This is my brother's wife...

681
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:14,684
Please come, sit down...

682
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,221
Why are you resting here,

683
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,446
there is a lot of wedding
work to do... let's go...

684
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,483
Sit down...

685
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,695
Will you agree to
everything everyone says? - No...

686
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,953
What happened?

687
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:27,693
What else do I say...?

688
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,626
Ever since my son was a child,
you've called him the Bridegroom

689
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,232
and he has nurtured dreams
of marrying your daughter...

690
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,833
Now, you are getting her
married to someone else

691
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,828
and expect us to join the festivity...

692
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,637
Don't we have any shame...?

693
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,239
What is it, Bridegroom?

694
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,841
No one should utter
the word "Bridegroom"

695
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,973
I spoke about him...

696
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,472
Let me see you...

697
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,343
This guy...? Go ahead!!

698
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,356
Are you from the
Groom's family or the Girl's?

699
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,034
The Groom's house...

700
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,036
How are you related to the Groom?

701
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:10,868
The Groom does not want the wedding...

702
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:14,877
Who are you?

703
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:18,711
I am the Groom...

704
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,415
My daughter's
wedding has been stalled...

705
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,887
Who will marry her now?

706
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,958
Uncle, I am there...
- Hey...

707
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,422
Excuse me...

708
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,497
Can you help me?
- What is it?

709
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:47,734
I want to talk to the girl's parents
or the elders in her family...

710
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,445
The Groom wants to talk
to the girl's family!!

711
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:51,773
The Groom wants to talk
to the girl's family!!

712
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,982
The Groom wants to talk
to the girl's family!!

713
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,749
That is unacceptable...
- Please keep quiet...

714
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,078
Who said that...?

715
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,924
Please wait!!

716
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,787
Why are all of you having
such heated discussions?

717
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,518
This is something we
don't do in this family...

718
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,458
The elders in the family have
already discussed everything...

719
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,791
What does it mean when the Groom...

720
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,002
...wants to talk to the girl's family
a day before the wedding?

721
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:14,460
It's wrong...

722
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:18,004
What is wrong...?
It's wrong to have let you inside...

723
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:19,806
I think you have instigated everyone...

724
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,476
You...
- Wait...

725
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,543
Is that the problem...? Wait...

726
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:24,943
Come here...
- Mom

727
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,780
Come on...
- Mom...

728
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:41,830
This is the Girl's family...
The Aunts, Uncles and others...

729
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,555
And this is the girl's sister...

730
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,503
Greet everyone...
- Hi!

731
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,036
What are all of you looking at?
Greet him...

732
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:52,964
Hello!

733
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,041
He has not met any of you before this...

734
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,038
He just wanted to meet everyone...

735
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,676
Why are all you having a
heated discussion for this...?

736
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,683
Now that you have seen him, please get
going... We're running out of time...

737
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:04,512
Is this all?

738
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,052
It's only when you give us a clear
explanation like this, will we understand...

739
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,718
Come on... Get going...
- Mom...

740
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:09,720
Get the flowers ready...

741
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,393
Check out the arrangements
at the wedding hall...

742
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:15,063
Why are you keeping it there?
- I won't say it...

743
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,590
Come on...
- Mom...

744
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,822
You... What is this mom...?

745
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,727
I am your mother...
your tricks will not work with me...

746
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,598
Change your clothes and
get ready for the function...

747
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,602
Please come...

748
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,832
Muruga... Serve Coffee to the guests...

749
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,850
I've said whatever has to be said...
there's nothing...

750
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,709
Don't rush to any
conclusion like that...

751
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,013
Who else is left to talk to?

752
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:41,182
There is someone...

753
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,626
Who?
- The Bride...

754
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,556
That's a good sign...

755
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:54,496
Say you don't want the wedding;
I'll take care of everything else...

756
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,667
That is Meena...

757
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,572
Come on... Let's go on to the
other side and talk to her...

758
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:18,985
She's crazy...

759
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,158
She's not holding the
Umbrella for herself...

760
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:38,707
My dear...

761
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,019
Let's go and talk to her...

762
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,030
That's wrong...

763
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:09,634
The head and heart's
dizzy and undecided...

764
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,039
It's raining...

765
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:12,904
Let's leave...

766
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,584
Come on... Let's go...

767
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,750
Come...

768
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,221
Mic testing... 1, 2, 1, 2

769
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:27,754
Hey... what's happening...?
Pump up the volume!!!

770
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,606
Bride... Oh! No...
I won't call you that...

771
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,610
No, it's fine...
you can call me that...

772
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,085
No... I won't...
- Just a moment...

773
00:59:58,194 --> 00:59:59,957
Oh, beautiful flower...

774
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,164
Earth shattering beauty...

775
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,089
Dark eyed beauty...

776
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,700
Beauty which melts the heart...

777
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,838
I have always been a
free bird... Flying high...

778
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:14,967
You have trapped me... completely,
oh, woman...

779
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:19,113
There he comes in a big procession...

780
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:23,649
For the auspicious occasion...
Bearing gifts, he comes...

781
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:27,721
Buy wedding finery for
the groom you've trapped...

782
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:32,724
Once the wedding rituals
are over, break into a song...

783
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,881
The moon that was
beautiful till yesterday...

784
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:05,357
Seems dull compared to you today...

785
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:07,228
The moon that appears tomorrow...

786
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:14,001
Will become the honeymoon for sure...

787
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:18,162
Unspoken happiness...
Silently sweeps me off my feet...

788
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:22,708
A wicked heaviness...
Quietly pinches my heart...

789
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,711
Hey, baby... Come near me...
And take my dreams with you!

790
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:30,909
Adorn the bride and groom with flowers...

791
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:35,046
Bless the newly wedded couple
with a good life and eternal bliss...

792
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:39,193
Adorn the bride and groom with flowers...

793
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:43,729
Bless the newly wedded couple
with a good life and eternal bliss...

794
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:02,074
The doors of my heart
were locked until now...

795
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,277
But I am struck by love... I am struck...

796
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,281
My feet which have treaded battlefields...

797
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:14,960
Will now approach
Flower shops, oh, woman!

798
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:19,225
My mind scolds me without respect!

799
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:23,235
My tongue screams your name,
without respite!

800
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,765
Hey, baby... Come near me...

801
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,771
And take my dreams with you!

802
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:31,969
There he comes in a big procession...

803
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:36,107
For the auspicious occasion,
bearing gifts, he comes...

804
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:40,311
Buy wedding finery for
the groom you've trapped...

805
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,853
Once the wedding rituals
are over... Break into a song...

806
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,860
Oh, beautiful flower...
Earth shattering beauty...

807
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,000
Dark eyed beauty...
Beauty which melts the heart...

808
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:57,128
I have always been a
free bird... Flying high...

809
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:01,332
You have trapped me... completely,
oh, woman...

810
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:22,121
The head and heart's
dizzy and undecided...

811
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:30,165
I was scared you would say
something silly and stop the wedding...

812
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:34,843
No one let me say anything then;
I am going to speak to her directly...

813
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,005
Oh my god! Please don't, brother...

814
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,012
Whatever it is,
speak to her in the morning...

815
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,847
The wedding night comes
only once in a life time...

816
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,018
Don't say something and mess things up...

817
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,482
Abi...

818
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,356
For starts, you need to see a girl...

819
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,018
One must like her...

820
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,524
Say "I love you" to her...

821
01:03:56,232 --> 01:04:00,191
And only then come formalities like
the wedding, the wedding night etc.,

822
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,539
It's happening in reverse in my case...

823
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,032
What are you going to do now?

824
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,215
I need to talk to you...

825
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,053
About myself...
- About you...?

826
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,591
About my work...
- Your work...?

827
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,395
I have no control over my hours of work...

828
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:36,464
I can't meet any
expectations of an average man...

829
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,898
What work do you have at the village?

830
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,237
Who is from the village?
- Aren't you from here?

831
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:44,410
Who told you that?

832
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,072
I am coming back here after 10 years...

833
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,418
Are you educated?
- Am I educated?!

834
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,918
Hello... Excuse me...

835
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:54,623
I am an Eye Doctor...

836
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,422
Doctor...!?
- Ya...

837
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,157
My dream is to build a big
eye research foundation in India...

838
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,624
Where do you work?

839
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:02,962
Where do you work as a Doctor?

840
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,962
At Delhi...
- At Delhi...?

841
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,931
I agreed to this wedding
only because you are from Delhi...

842
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:09,938
Aren't you from Delhi?

843
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,107
Huh?
- Aren't you from Delhi?

844
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:13,438
Yes...

845
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,271
I was told you work as a Policeman...

846
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,610
Are you a Sub Inspector (SI)
or an Inspector?

847
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,611
I...
- Are you an SI...!?

848
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,654
Don't worry...

849
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,962
The Delhi Police Commissioner
is my patient...

850
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:34,993
He's from our hometown...

851
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,961
I will tell him and get you an
Inspector's posting... Is that ok?

852
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:44,463
Actually, coming to the point...

853
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,968
You might have had a lot of
dreams about your wife to be...

854
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,545
I had dreams too...

855
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,143
According to me,
you need to meet someone...

856
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,215
Become friends... Fall in love...

857
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,544
Get married...

858
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,978
And only then comes the wedding night...

859
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:04,151
However, for us... But, it's ok...

860
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:10,224
We have met now,
let's try becoming friends...

861
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,491
The rest will come later...

862
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:14,560
Ok...?

863
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,006
This is a village...

864
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,634
Let our Deal remain between us...

865
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,657
I shouldn't call him the Bridegroom,
but he will act like one for sure...

866
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,662
I was really worried
about what would happen!!

867
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,200
Shiva...
- Yes, Mom...

868
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,501
Why are you standing there,
wasting time?

869
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,541
Have a bath and get ready...

870
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:33,205
We need to go to Meenakshi's house...
They have come to take us there... - Yes...

871
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,378
Hi!

872
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,392
Please come, Son-in-law...

873
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,561
I couldn't speak to you amidst the
hustle and bustle of the wedding...

874
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,702
I worked with the Air Force...
That became my life...

875
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,436
I was transferred to a
different place every 3 years...

876
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:00,074
Serve the elders first...
- Ok...

877
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,239
When Meena studied medicine,
all of us were at Delhi...

878
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,779
I retired after that and shifted
to Thirupathur with the family...

879
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:08,547
Meena stayed back there...

880
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,076
Please sit down and take rest...

881
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,552
This is Meena's room...

882
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,716
Please check on what he wants...

883
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:32,265
What are you looking at?

884
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,437
Nice paintings... Where did you buy them?

885
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,273
Where did we buy them?!

886
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,279
My sister painted these
while in school... It's Modern Art...

887
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:42,813
She like's the works of MF Hussain,

888
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:47,586
Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Ravi Varma...

889
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,752
Well! Do you know
anything about paintings?

890
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:54,753
No...

891
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,299
Did your sister write these
books while she was in School?

892
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,301
Are you mocking?

893
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,302
Tolstoy! Does she like Tolstoy?

894
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,474
Does she like Tolstoy?!

895
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,770
My sister likes Tolstoy,
Charles Dickens,

896
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,770
Paulo Coelho and
Dan Brown's books a lot...

897
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,650
She doesn't go to sleep without reading...

898
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,785
Do you read?

899
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,781
If I need to fall asleep, I read...

900
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,150
It's going to be tough!

901
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:55,353
She loves music...

902
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,520
Are you interested in music?

903
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:01,688
Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Tchaikovsky...

904
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,523
Do you know any of these people...?

905
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,662
Have you atleast heard their music...?

906
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,204
Well!!

907
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:15,542
Did you see my
daughter-in-law play the piano so well?

908
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,578
Look at how modest she is in
spite of all the talent she has...

909
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:20,543
Why would you hesitate to marry her?

910
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,841
Be happy atleast now...

911
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,557
You played the piano very well...
- Thanks...

912
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,553
You have a bright future in music...

913
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:35,853
But, music is not my dream...

914
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,856
Eye Research Foundation...

915
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:44,236
The most awful thing in the
world is not being able to see...

916
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,274
The aim of my Eye Research Foundation is

917
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,704
to bring light in to the lives
of people living in darkness...

918
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,237
Do you know music?

919
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,581
I do...

920
01:10:56,986 --> 01:11:01,753
But since I am interested in
painting now, I've let go of music...

921
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:02,958
Really...?

922
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:07,728
What kind of paintings do you like?

923
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,960
Picasso, Da Vinci...

924
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:17,270
Oh God! Even I like them...

925
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:20,271
Is that so? That's a surprise...

926
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:24,746
In fact,

927
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,976
I became interested in
paintings only because of books...

928
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:34,287
Books... Do you read books?
- Yes...

929
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,620
Who are the Authors you read?

930
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,456
Tolstoy, Paulo Coelho...

931
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:42,629
Daniel...

932
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,936
Journals...

933
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:50,929
Magazines...

934
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:28,502
This guy!

935
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,812
Sir... here's the
Murderer you are looking for...

936
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,675
You have let him go and
have kept me locked up...

937
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:43,723
Mr. Veerakathy... The Kenny you
are talking about cannot see...

938
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,383
I never said he can see...

939
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,856
I only said he is a murderer...

940
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,725
He needs people to help
him even to cross the road...

941
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,524
How can you call him a murderer?

942
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,703
He needs help only to cross the road...

943
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,597
not to murder someone...

944
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,541
Kenny is an innocent guy...

945
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,078
He earns a living by
playing the Piano at Church...

946
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:04,706
Which Church?

947
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,015
Kenny doesn't live here...

948
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:12,887
Then, where?

949
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:13,884
I don't know...

950
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,557
He comes here in the morning
and leaves in the evening...

951
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,748
How long has Kenny been here?

952
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,620
About 6 months...

953
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:20,556
How do you know him?

954
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:24,560
Kenny was referred to
us by the Blind school...

955
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,415
Oh... Sorry!

956
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,435
Whoa! Be careful, there's water here...

957
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:11,808
You guys aren't my
students... How can I help you?

958
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,605
May I know who is running this place?

959
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,077
That would be me... I am Daniel Kish...

960
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,612
Oh! Can I talk to you for a few minutes?

961
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,480
Give me 5 minutes...

962
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,689
I'll finish the
session and join you guys...

963
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,099
Echolocation...

964
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:39,930
What does that mean?

965
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:45,570
A Bat, though it
can't see, makes a sound

966
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,908
and with the help of
an echo coming from it,

967
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,585
identifies people and objects around...

968
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,014
They are just like that...

969
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,182
They do not require anyone's help...

970
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:00,856
Even if things are
1000 feet away from them,

971
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:03,031
they can sense it accurately...

972
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,032
Their ears are their eyes...

973
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,870
Yes, Kenny is totally blind...

974
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:14,031
He lost his eyes in an
accident a year ago...

975
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:19,877
He was referred to us by... UC...

976
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,606
Yes, it was UCLH Hospital...

977
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:23,613
Who brought Kenny to you?

978
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,581
He originally came with his wife...

979
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,723
Can you tell me in what kind of
an accident Kenny lost his sight?

980
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,723
Yes, it was the 2011 Serial bomb blast...

981
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:37,220
He survived the Tower Bridge Assault...

982
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,067
Is there another Kenny?

983
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,745
No Sir... he's the only one...

984
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,651
Scan this photo immediately,

985
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,252
Find out who he is
through Face Identification...

986
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:09,759
What happened, Sir...?

987
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:13,628
The original name of the Kenny
we are looking for is, Shiva...

988
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:15,929
Not only is he the Death touch Murderer,

989
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:20,268
He is the prime person behind the 1-11 serial
bomb blasts that shook up this country...

990
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,272
He is a Terrorist...

991
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,105
Hello...

992
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:28,780
Sarah...

993
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,829
Victor, April 5, 4pm...

994
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,665
April 5 is today...

995
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,974
Taxi!!

996
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:03,710
Where do you want to go?

997
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,977
Chelsea...
- Chelsea?

998
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,321
You are that Murderer's...

999
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,989
Oh my God! It's you! Please get off...

1000
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:15,730
I am trying to run away from my
troubles and fresh ones are chasing me...

1001
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:17,194
Please get down... Get down!

1002
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,691
Please, I need to go there urgently...

1003
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:19,731
If it's that urgent,

1004
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,731
You can lie that you're having a
heart attack and take an Ambulance...

1005
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,198
I have enough troubles already,
please... get down...

1006
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,698
Please, I'll pay you a double fare...

1007
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:27,706
Double Fare...?

1008
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,840
Sarah...
- Dad...

1009
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,013
The Murderer's Mobile...

1010
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,066
34 Pounds, please...

1011
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,230
Hey!!! Hey!!!

1012
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:43,674
Hello!!! Hello!!! Excuse me... Hello!!

1013
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:44,778
Hey!

1014
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:46,783
Let him go!

1015
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:47,944
Leave him!

1016
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,680
What are you doing
without giving me the money...?

1017
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,102
Hey listen... You can't escape...

1018
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:09,105
The Police are here... Don't move!

1019
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,816
Oh, my God!! The Police!!

1020
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,716
They will let him go
but get me instead!!!

1021
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,119
Hey...
- Hey...

1022
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:24,826
Stop there!
- Hello...

1023
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:25,960
God!! Police!!!

1024
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,129
Cops!!!

1025
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,468
Hey! Hey! Hey! It's my car! Oh my God!

1026
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:40,341
You can't escape!!!

1027
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,209
Hey catch him!!!!
- The Police had surrounded you!

1028
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,844
Hey...
- Stop the car!

1029
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:45,980
Oh, my god!

1030
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,218
Cops!

1031
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,754
Sir, careful...

1032
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,357
Sarah...

1033
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,852
Can't you see?

1034
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:19,377
Victor...

1035
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:22,408
The owner of several million
pounds worth, Skyway Steel Factory...

1036
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,409
What were you doing at your
corporate office all by yourself,

1037
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:26,377
on the day of the incident?

1038
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:29,551
Because it was a Saturday,
everyone left by afternoon...

1039
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,219
That is why I was by myself...

1040
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:33,223
Have you seen that murderer before?

1041
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:34,517
This is the first time...

1042
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,227
Why should he come to murder you?

1043
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,557
What else, but, money?

1044
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,092
What makes you say that?

1045
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,428
Everyone he has killed has
been a multi millionaire...

1046
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:45,232
Do you know any one of
them who's been killed?

1047
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,236
I don't know any of them, Sir...

1048
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:51,902
Then, how do you say for sure
that he killed them only for money...?

1049
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:56,243
Well... The Papers... Media...
- Excuse me, Sir...

1050
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:58,418
They found the car on
the Greenwich Bridge,

1051
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,316
but the 3 people are missing...

1052
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:06,255
It's all gone...

1053
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:09,089
My Taxi has been washed away...

1054
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:14,433
After all that he has done,
look at him, relaxing...

1055
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:17,565
Shouldn't wait here any longer...

1056
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,440
Very dangerous...

1057
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:31,276
Help!!

1058
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,115
Help!!

1059
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,014
There's a car coming... Hang on...

1060
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:38,123
Help!!
- Hello please...

1061
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,293
Actually...

1062
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,296
Lift, please... Help...

1063
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:47,160
Are you a Tamilian?

1064
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,302
Thank God! Mam, are you a Tamilian?

1065
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:50,469
We are stuck with a murderer...

1066
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,497
Please help us... Please take us...

1067
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:55,136
Ok... Ok... Ok... Relax... Relax...
- Thank you!

1068
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:57,612
Come in...

1069
01:21:58,513 --> 01:21:59,377
This way...

1070
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,310
This looks like a Haunted house...

1071
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,052
Is he your husband?

1072
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:10,485
Hello, Sir...

1073
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:15,161
Oh, my God! That's the Devil himself...

1074
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,496
Hurry up!

1075
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,397
Oh, my God! Where do we run...?
Let's go this way...

1076
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:27,332
Help!!

1077
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:28,668
Another girl's screaming...

1078
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,634
Come, here is another way...
- That's an echo...

1079
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,016
Help!!

1080
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:38,550
Help!

1081
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,551
No point screaming...

1082
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,355
You won't find a soul
for the next 8 miles...

1083
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,081
Thought you were a beautiful model,

1084
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:46,692
but you are a Thug hanging
around with a murderer...

1085
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,028
Who are you? Let us go...

1086
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:50,197
Who is a murderer?

1087
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,660
Do you know who he is?

1088
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,102
Do you know what happened to him?

1089
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,283
You said he was an SI
but he has a fancy car...

1090
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,288
He probably takes bribes...

1091
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,621
The early morning flowers...

1092
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:26,157
Yearn to see you...

1093
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:29,495
The evening clouds...

1094
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:33,003
Rest as they watch you...

1095
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,642
Is the Wedding over...
- Yes...

1096
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,371
You seem very happy...

1097
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:46,721
This is Seethama...

1098
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:51,650
I don't miss my Mom so
much because she's here...

1099
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:06,663
It is your eyes that
the stars search for...

1100
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:13,036
To live with you... is a boon!

1101
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:16,340
You bring dreams...

1102
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:19,745
You bring poetry...

1103
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:28,061
You bring relationships... into my life...

1104
01:24:36,537 --> 01:24:39,631
The ace Nuclear Scientist of
our country... Mr. Ravi Mugra...

1105
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:43,310
He was killed mysteriously last week...

1106
01:24:43,544 --> 01:24:44,977
Isn't this a Police Case...?

1107
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,280
He had developed special
weapon for our Military forces...

1108
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:51,274
The Flow Chart with
the Formula was with him...

1109
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,510
That Flow Chart is missing...

1110
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:55,556
And, you were missing here...

1111
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:57,422
I took charge of the Case...

1112
01:24:57,658 --> 01:25:00,559
It's a big case... Do well, Sharath...

1113
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:01,693
Thanks, buddy...

1114
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:13,537
Sharath...

1115
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,433
He is the only friend, family,

1116
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:20,579
philosopher, guide I have here in Delhi...

1117
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:22,782
That's not true...
We are close buddies working

1118
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:25,884
in the same department,
holding similar positions...

1119
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,045
In which Police Station
do you work in, as an SI...?

1120
01:25:31,592 --> 01:25:33,719
The Mugra IV is a special weapon...

1121
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:35,451
Made of 4 parts...

1122
01:25:35,596 --> 01:25:37,723
Each part is 3 centimeters...

1123
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,422
You can impose it anywhere...

1124
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,467
Dust bin... Post Box... Brief Case...

1125
01:25:42,703 --> 01:25:45,900
No Metal Detector can detect it...

1126
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:49,905
If this goes off,
the blast radius is 50 meters...

1127
01:25:51,712 --> 01:25:53,077
And the worst part is...

1128
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,917
If you get the Flow Chart, it
takes just 4 hours to assemble...

1129
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,078
This is very dangerous...

1130
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:02,915
Ok...

1131
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:06,825
You can count on me for any
help you need in this case...

1132
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:07,925
Ok...?

1133
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:09,460
Where are you going?

1134
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:13,095
Piano Class...
- Piano...? - Ya...

1135
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,477
Play it...

1136
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,512
The Piano...

1137
01:26:26,747 --> 01:26:28,647
The Harmonium first...

1138
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,943
The Piano comes a year later... Play it...

1139
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:35,785
Hey! Not like that...

1140
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:38,854
Like this! Play it...

1141
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:55,137
I was sitting downstairs
while I heard a voice from above...

1142
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,873
Which window was it...?

1143
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:05,681
Tell me...
- Hi! Are you busy?

1144
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,818
What is it?

1145
01:27:07,054 --> 01:27:09,887
Can you come to Connaught
Place right away? Tagore Gallery...

1146
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:12,024
I am a little busy, I can't come now...

1147
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,023
No, you have to come...

1148
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,526
No... I am attending an important case...

1149
01:27:16,697 --> 01:27:17,527
This is important too...

1150
01:27:17,798 --> 01:27:19,163
Sorry, I can't come...

1151
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:22,536
Sorry, Meena, I'll be waiting for you...

1152
01:27:22,703 --> 01:27:24,227
I said I am busy, can't you understand...?

1153
01:27:25,806 --> 01:27:26,898
This is why I didn't
want to get married...

1154
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:29,534
Please give me my space...

1155
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:37,911
How is he now, Doctor...?
- Nothing to worry...

1156
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,177
You've done a great job, Dr. Meenakshi...

1157
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,850
You've proven yourself once again...

1158
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,181
Thank you, Doctor...
- Good...

1159
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:45,251
You have to thank Dr. Meenakshi...

1160
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:46,921
Doctor, Thank you...

1161
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,561
You've been of great help...

1162
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,197
The Patient's wife...

1163
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:57,936
I have nothing to give you, keep this...

1164
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,197
This is all I have right now...

1165
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,042
You have to accept this as
a token of my Gratitude...

1166
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,082
Tagore Gallery...?

1167
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,878
We are closed for the day...

1168
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:15,713
Please come back tomorrow morning...

1169
01:28:16,657 --> 01:28:19,888
Is Shivakumar...?
- Are you a Tamilian?

1170
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:22,292
Mr. Shivakumar has left...

1171
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:27,595
What happened here?

1172
01:28:27,768 --> 01:28:29,235
There was a painting Exhibition...

1173
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:33,064
It was for "Meenakshi
Eye Research Foundation"...

1174
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,772
They are raising funds through this...

1175
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,308
Mr. Shivakumar had
arranged this exhibition...

1176
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:41,743
The Minister inaugurated it...

1177
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:43,617
Can I take a look?

1178
01:28:58,766 --> 01:28:59,926
Everything has been sold...

1179
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:01,999
Only that Modern Art painting's left...

1180
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:05,672
Mr. Shivakumar refused
to sell it at any cost...

1181
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:57,149
Sorry, I didn't call you to disturb you...

1182
01:29:58,292 --> 01:29:59,316
There were many important people...

1183
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,160
Friends...?

1184
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,167
"See" her...

1185
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:17,708
"Like" her...

1186
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:20,712
"Marry" her...

1187
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:23,181
Now..."Friends" with her...

1188
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:28,845
"Love"...

1189
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:35,721
Sir... No, Sir...

1190
01:30:35,896 --> 01:30:36,726
Sir... but...

1191
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:38,729
Sure, Sir...

1192
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:43,904
The Investigations,
Enquiries and Verifications are over...

1193
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:47,369
We've checked the details of
everyone with a criminal record...

1194
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:48,867
No leads yet...

1195
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:51,044
In a 1.2 Billion
population across India,

1196
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:53,440
how can we question anyone
without proper evidence?

1197
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:59,216
What if he is not an Indian...?

1198
01:31:01,021 --> 01:31:03,922
Why can't he be a terrorist
or a spy from another country?

1199
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:05,386
That's a good point...

1200
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:08,755
List out the foreigners who have
visited India in the last 6 months...

1201
01:31:08,929 --> 01:31:10,920
Identify the people
who have not returned...

1202
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:12,063
We will definitely find a clue...

1203
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:13,392
What if he has left the country already?

1204
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:14,765
No, he hasn't...

1205
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,232
Had he gone, the bomb
would have gone off...

1206
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:20,397
Play it...

1207
01:31:24,945 --> 01:31:27,243
Hey! Not like that...

1208
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:32,410
Play it...

1209
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,084
Like that...

1210
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,274
Play it... Play it...

1211
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:12,448
It's my birthday today...

1212
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:16,321
If my parents were here,

1213
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:18,293
I would have taken their blessings...

1214
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:21,126
Since, they aren't... I am...

1215
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:30,976
Anything else...?

1216
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:39,146
Hello...
- Hi...

1217
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:40,877
Tell me...
- Are you done with work?

1218
01:32:41,121 --> 01:32:42,850
I just got done... I am leaving...

1219
01:32:43,023 --> 01:32:44,854
Can we go out for dinner?

1220
01:32:45,926 --> 01:32:48,156
I am very tired... Can we go another day?

1221
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:49,326
Well...

1222
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,490
I have booked a table... Can we...?

1223
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:54,868
It's already late...

1224
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:56,866
By the time we meet and then...

1225
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:00,230
We've met...

1226
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:04,173
Shall we...?

1227
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:26,357
I didn't notice it...

1228
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:29,900
Please do...

1229
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:45,911
Sir, you've come?
- Ya...

1230
01:33:46,086 --> 01:33:46,916
Me...

1231
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:50,613
Meena...

1232
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,225
We are waiting for you, Sir...

1233
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:02,298
Everything is ready... Please come...

1234
01:34:03,203 --> 01:34:05,637
Everything is ready, isn't it...?
They've come... - Sorry!

1235
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:09,300
You have to take care of
everything personally...

1236
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:12,410
Sir... Sir... Sir...

1237
01:34:15,115 --> 01:34:16,082
I love you...

1238
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:18,575
I love you...

1239
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:20,420
I love you...

1240
01:34:21,021 --> 01:34:23,080
I love you...

1241
01:34:31,131 --> 01:34:31,961
I love you...

1242
01:34:32,232 --> 01:34:33,256
Good night...

1243
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,100
One minute...

1244
01:34:37,037 --> 01:34:38,265
What is it...?
- I...

1245
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:40,971
I...

1246
01:34:42,242 --> 01:34:43,334
I... Happy Birthday...

1247
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:45,970
How did you know...?

1248
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,107
Friends...?

1249
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:51,114
Thanks...

1250
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,345
What's that...?
- What...?

1251
01:34:55,589 --> 01:34:58,615
What's in your hand...?
- Nothing...

1252
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,620
Show me what that is...
- That's... Sorry...

1253
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,621
Hello...

1254
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,499
Ganshyam, the Manager
from the Park Hotel...

1255
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:08,361
Oh... one second...

1256
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:10,365
You left just like that...

1257
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:13,630
I cancelled all my
reservations for you... - No... Uh!

1258
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:16,168
Am going to lose my job over this...

1259
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,002
I am sorry... I am sorry...

1260
01:35:18,178 --> 01:35:20,373
You have to come back right now...

1261
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:21,706
Right now!

1262
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:23,314
I am sorry!

1263
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:37,395
Sharath, we can't call 1426 foreigners
for an enquiry without evidence...

1264
01:35:37,631 --> 01:35:39,189
That will lead to a big problem...

1265
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:43,062
It will also affect our
International relations...

1266
01:35:43,303 --> 01:35:46,329
The Home Minister
will not agree to this...

1267
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:48,064
Why should we ask the Minister?

1268
01:35:48,308 --> 01:35:51,072
What are you saying?
- Well...

1269
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,678
If a bomb goes off tomorrow,

1270
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,344
they will blame us for
incorrect Intelligence reports...

1271
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:57,210
And walk away,
safeguarding their ministry...

1272
01:35:57,451 --> 01:35:59,351
What do you suggest...?

1273
01:35:59,553 --> 01:36:01,077
Sir...

1274
01:36:01,321 --> 01:36:04,415
Give us permission to
investigate the 1426 foreigners...

1275
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:06,523
I will find the Flow Chart in a week...

1276
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:09,520
Shivakumar...

1277
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:12,698
Sir... - The Prime Minister
is leaving to China tomorrow...

1278
01:36:14,134 --> 01:36:15,692
Please check if all
the details are in place...

1279
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:22,203
This is very urgent...

1280
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:24,240
All details should be there
on my table within an hour...

1281
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:25,706
Yes, Sir...
- Okay!

1282
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:27,771
Hello...

1283
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:29,443
Are you busy...?

1284
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:31,716
No...

1285
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:34,383
Can you come to No: 40, Lodhi Gardens...?

1286
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:36,385
Good night sir!
- What's happening there?

1287
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:40,082
Oh! Do I need to give you all
the details for you to come...?

1288
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:42,557
No...

1289
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:48,391
Shiva...

1290
01:36:49,269 --> 01:36:50,099
Hey...

1291
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:53,399
Can I ask you now... What's...?

1292
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:57,743
It's my Chief Doctor's
Wedding Anniversary...

1293
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:00,238
Me... at the Doctor's party...

1294
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:02,244
It's not the host we
need to worry about...

1295
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,417
It's the guests I want you to meet...

1296
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:05,414
Who is...?

1297
01:37:05,652 --> 01:37:07,415
The Police Commissioner of Delhi...

1298
01:37:08,288 --> 01:37:09,152
Commissioner...

1299
01:37:09,389 --> 01:37:11,289
I called you to talk
about your promotion...

1300
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:13,117
Promotion...?
- Ya...

1301
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:16,660
No, you don't have to...

1302
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:18,355
Shiva...

1303
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:19,833
What happened...?

1304
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:23,431
The Commissioner... I am going home...

1305
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:25,194
Are you scared of the Commissioner...?

1306
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:27,437
He is my patient...

1307
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:30,437
Why worry when I am here... Come...

1308
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:37,684
He's here... Come on...

1309
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,552
It's been 25 years...

1310
01:37:40,721 --> 01:37:41,688
Excuse me, Sir...

1311
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:44,382
Hello, Doctor...
- He's...

1312
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,124
He's my...
- Sir...

1313
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:54,232
I didn't get any
information about you coming here...

1314
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:57,564
Sir, is everything ok, Sir...?

1315
01:37:57,838 --> 01:38:01,137
I have come here informally...

1316
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,706
Oh! That's great, Sir...

1317
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:06,607
Sir... One moment, if you don't mind...

1318
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:11,707
Sir... Could you speak to the
Minister about my DIG promotion...?

1319
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:14,479
Yes... I am talking about it...

1320
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:22,419
Why is the Commissioner
calling the SI, "Sir"...?

1321
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:23,596
Sub Inspector...?

1322
01:38:23,864 --> 01:38:27,766
He is one of the top 5
Intelligence Officers in the country...

1323
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:28,896
The Research and Analysis Wing...

1324
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:31,737
He is a very
influential Officer in India...

1325
01:39:14,414 --> 01:39:17,281
According to me, you
need to meet someone...

1326
01:39:17,517 --> 01:39:17,881
Become friends...

1327
01:39:18,318 --> 01:39:21,219
Fall in love... Get married...

1328
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:22,479
But, it's ok...

1329
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:27,427
We have met now, let's
try becoming friends...

1330
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:29,891
The rest will come later... ok...?

1331
01:39:58,558 --> 01:40:06,658
"You" means me...

1332
01:40:08,368 --> 01:40:16,434
"l" means us...

1333
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:38,623
One half of the door is you...

1334
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:42,632
The other half is me...

1335
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:46,363
Looking at each other as we separate...

1336
01:40:46,606 --> 01:40:49,803
To be united, we patiently wait...

1337
01:40:49,976 --> 01:40:53,377
One half of the door is you...

1338
01:40:53,613 --> 01:40:57,379
The other half is me...

1339
01:40:57,617 --> 01:41:00,950
The latch is open and yet we wait...

1340
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:03,983
For the wind to blow
and unite us forever...

1341
01:41:04,424 --> 01:41:11,330
"You" means me...

1342
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:19,504
"l" means us...

1343
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:26,546
One half of the door is you...

1344
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:33,743
The other half is me...

1345
01:41:35,021 --> 01:41:36,352
He was our only son...

1346
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:40,525
He died 5 years back...
Because of a Brain Tumor...

1347
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:43,529
He would have died at Child Birth...

1348
01:41:44,898 --> 01:41:47,526
Had to remove Asha's
Uterus to save him...

1349
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:49,693
But, we were still unlucky...

1350
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:51,900
We try hard to console ourselves...

1351
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:54,369
But, a child is truly precious...

1352
01:42:15,028 --> 01:42:18,464
When night falls,

1353
01:42:18,698 --> 01:42:21,929
the fear of theft
brings the doors together...

1354
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:25,798
The doors themselves will steal...

1355
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:28,940
Love will make them
perform this miracle...

1356
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:32,737
Both joined hands and came together...

1357
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:36,473
Making the imaginary locks disappear...

1358
01:42:36,716 --> 01:42:44,748
The doorway shudders, struggles,
celebrates!

1359
01:42:45,725 --> 01:42:46,749
Where are we going...?

1360
01:42:50,997 --> 01:42:52,055
To your favorite place...

1361
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:02,767
One half of the door is you...

1362
01:43:02,976 --> 01:43:09,848
The other half is me...

1363
01:43:43,783 --> 01:43:47,014
There was thunder, lightning and rain...

1364
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:50,690
And yet, we stood firm and unshaken...

1365
01:43:50,924 --> 01:43:54,553
But how is it that we
came together, today...

1366
01:43:54,794 --> 01:43:57,888
Just with our gentle breaths,
I wonder...

1367
01:43:58,131 --> 01:44:01,498
Our hearts have become one today...

1368
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:05,034
Now, there are no doors in the way...

1369
01:44:05,272 --> 01:44:08,036
From now on and forever more,

1370
01:44:08,275 --> 01:44:15,511
Only fragrant breeze in
our abode shall blow...

1371
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:24,053
One half of the door is you...

1372
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:28,024
The other half is me...

1373
01:44:28,194 --> 01:44:31,721
Looking at each other as we separate...

1374
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:35,059
To be united, we patiently wait...

1375
01:44:35,302 --> 01:44:38,863
One half of the door is you...

1376
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:42,872
The other half is me...

1377
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:46,534
The latch is open and yet we wait...

1378
01:44:46,746 --> 01:44:49,544
For the wind to blow
and unite us forever...

1379
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:56,882
"You" means me...

1380
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:59,888
"l" means us...

1381
01:45:00,093 --> 01:45:01,560
Isn't it weird...?

1382
01:45:03,997 --> 01:45:07,728
Everyone, but Mumtaz knew how
much Shah Jahan loved her...

1383
01:45:07,867 --> 01:45:09,562
...Except one!

1384
01:45:13,106 --> 01:45:14,130
" Mumtaz "

1385
01:45:27,887 --> 01:45:30,321
After that I never entered a
Chinese Restaurant... - Ya...?

1386
01:45:35,362 --> 01:45:36,226
Hello...

1387
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:40,859
Where?

1388
01:45:41,935 --> 01:45:43,869
Stay there... I'm on my way...

1389
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:46,698
What happened...?

1390
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,368
We were right about our suspicion...

1391
01:45:48,808 --> 01:45:50,776
There is a foreigner who is
staying next to Jamma Masjid...

1392
01:45:51,277 --> 01:45:52,039
I'll have to go...

1393
01:45:52,278 --> 01:45:52,903
I'll come too...

1394
01:45:53,146 --> 01:45:54,909
No, No... You guys carry on...

1395
01:45:55,148 --> 01:45:56,911
Why don't you leave after dinner...?

1396
01:45:57,083 --> 01:46:00,883
No... I'll come back and
join you if possible... ok...?

1397
01:46:01,821 --> 01:46:04,915
Shiva, in case it gets late,
please drop Asha home...

1398
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:06,352
Ok...
- Sorry, guys...

1399
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:19,034
Sir...

1400
01:46:20,407 --> 01:46:21,203
Where is he...?

1401
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:32,207
Shall we leave...?
- Ya...

1402
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:34,378
Come...

1403
01:46:43,863 --> 01:46:44,761
What happened...?

1404
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:46,290
Why are you tense...?

1405
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:47,290
Sharath is not attending the call...

1406
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:49,224
Is Sharath attending the call...?

1407
01:46:50,203 --> 01:46:51,067
No...

1408
01:46:55,975 --> 01:46:56,964
Mr. Shivakumar...

1409
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,074
Yes, Sir...

1410
01:46:58,478 --> 01:46:59,445
Where is Sharath...?

1411
01:46:59,879 --> 01:47:02,313
He has gone in for an Enquiry...
He hasn't come back yet...

1412
01:47:04,217 --> 01:47:05,115
Which house is it...?

1413
01:47:05,351 --> 01:47:06,841
3rd Street, Number 14...

1414
01:48:51,858 --> 01:48:52,882
Hey! Hey! shiva, catch him!

1415
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,002
Hey... hey...

1416
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:46,109
Drop your gun!

1417
01:49:48,615 --> 01:49:49,946
Drop your gun!

1418
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:52,115
Drop it!

1419
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,423
Bad luck, brother!

1420
01:50:46,205 --> 01:50:47,638
If Sharath hadn't shot him...

1421
01:50:51,511 --> 01:50:53,172
I am scared...

1422
01:50:53,579 --> 01:50:54,637
Why are you getting
worked up for this...?

1423
01:50:55,348 --> 01:50:57,976
As a Doctor, you would have
seen more blood loss and pain...

1424
01:50:58,451 --> 01:50:59,645
It didn't hurt me then...

1425
01:51:04,457 --> 01:51:05,481
It does now...

1426
01:51:20,139 --> 01:51:20,662
Sir,

1427
01:51:22,275 --> 01:51:25,176
...the dead man's name, as
per his passport is, Steven...

1428
01:51:25,378 --> 01:51:28,040
But, that need not be his real name...

1429
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:31,375
He is surely here to
spy on our country...

1430
01:51:31,617 --> 01:51:33,244
If you hand this case over to me,

1431
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:36,717
I can investigate it further...
- This is Sharath's case...

1432
01:51:37,156 --> 01:51:38,521
Sir...
- You may go now...

1433
01:51:44,297 --> 01:51:44,729
Hello...

1434
01:51:45,164 --> 01:51:47,189
Shivakumar had come here...
- Yes, Sir...

1435
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,525
He explained the case to me...

1436
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:51,260
He says this couldn't have gone wrong,

1437
01:51:51,504 --> 01:51:53,404
unless someone in your
department is hand in glove...

1438
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:55,539
Tell Shivakumar to find
out who that person is...

1439
01:51:55,742 --> 01:51:59,075
...and ensure that our
Ministry doesn't get a bad name...

1440
01:51:59,312 --> 01:52:00,370
Yes, Sir...

1441
01:52:04,183 --> 01:52:04,706
Thank you, Sir...

1442
01:52:07,086 --> 01:52:07,711
Thanks, Bro...

1443
01:52:09,655 --> 01:52:12,556
If you weren't there,
I cannot imagine...

1444
01:52:16,095 --> 01:52:17,392
I've taken charge of the Case...

1445
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:20,292
Within 2 days we'll find
out about the Flow Chart...

1446
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:22,228
and about who is responsible for this...

1447
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:24,232
Are a lot of people involved in this...?

1448
01:52:24,537 --> 01:52:25,731
We'll get to know if
other people are involved...

1449
01:52:27,774 --> 01:52:30,743
...or whether it's our people
doing this behind our backs...

1450
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:25,357
Where are the clothes
Steven was wearing that day...?

1451
01:53:25,598 --> 01:53:26,622
In the locker room, Sir...

1452
01:53:48,421 --> 01:53:50,651
How are you confident...

1453
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:52,517
...that it's the Flow Chart
that was sent by cargo...?

1454
01:53:52,758 --> 01:53:56,387
The weight of the cargo was 5.5 grams...

1455
01:53:56,629 --> 01:53:59,860
Only a pen drive normally
weighs around 5 to 6 grams...

1456
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:02,201
What if he had sent the
Flow Chart in a pen drive...?

1457
01:54:02,435 --> 01:54:04,528
I think you are imagining things...

1458
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:06,203
I am not imagining, Sir...

1459
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:08,737
That cargo is being sent to a
British Intelligence Officer...

1460
01:54:09,175 --> 01:54:10,870
Then, we should inform
the British Intelligence...

1461
01:54:11,244 --> 01:54:12,404
That is not possible, Sir...

1462
01:54:12,645 --> 01:54:14,203
This is our military secret...

1463
01:54:14,447 --> 01:54:17,416
If they get to know we were working
on such a weapon of mass destruction,

1464
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:19,880
We will face several problems
including economic sanctions...

1465
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:21,217
So...?

1466
01:54:21,454 --> 01:54:22,853
I've checked...

1467
01:54:23,556 --> 01:54:25,421
The cargo will reach in 4 days...

1468
01:54:25,658 --> 01:54:27,353
If you permit me,

1469
01:54:27,593 --> 01:54:30,187
I can go to London and stop the
parcel from being delivered...

1470
01:54:31,564 --> 01:54:32,690
I'll have to permit you;

1471
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,368
else the Minister will call me...

1472
01:54:38,604 --> 01:54:42,370
Meena... Meena... What happened...?

1473
01:54:45,912 --> 01:54:47,209
Shiva is going to London...

1474
01:54:47,947 --> 01:54:50,541
He'll take 4 days to return...
- So, what...?

1475
01:54:54,687 --> 01:54:56,712
Shiva's birthday is on
the 1st ofJanuary...

1476
01:54:56,923 --> 01:54:58,390
He'll be back by then...

1477
01:54:58,591 --> 01:55:00,388
Why are you getting
tense unnecessarily...?

1478
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,593
This was my Mission...

1479
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:06,388
You are risking your life
and doing this instead of me...

1480
01:55:06,599 --> 01:55:08,226
You were the one who
gave my life back to me...

1481
01:55:09,602 --> 01:55:11,399
If you need anything, let me know...

1482
01:55:11,837 --> 01:55:12,735
Careful...

1483
01:55:13,372 --> 01:55:15,237
I' am leaving, Asha... Take Care...
- Bye, Bro...

1484
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:16,237
Be good...

1485
01:55:21,847 --> 01:55:22,905
I'll take your leave, Sir...

1486
01:55:23,282 --> 01:55:26,410
Just as much as a British
Intelligence Officer is a spy here,

1487
01:55:26,652 --> 01:55:29,815
You will also be a spy,
when you go there...

1488
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:33,919
You could meet the same fate...

1489
01:55:34,994 --> 01:55:35,926
Take care...

1490
01:55:40,866 --> 01:55:41,833
All the best...

1491
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:51,510
Mr. Kenny, a retired IPS Officer,
will receive you in London...

1492
01:55:51,744 --> 01:55:53,268
He was Mr. Ravichandran's Trainee...

1493
01:55:53,479 --> 01:55:56,642
He gave up his job for the
girl he loved and settled there...

1494
01:55:56,882 --> 01:55:59,851
Kenny will be with you
through this Operation...

1495
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:02,780
Shivakumar...?

1496
01:56:03,356 --> 01:56:05,620
Arjun Rathore...

1497
01:56:13,332 --> 01:56:15,459
Mr. Ravichandran has told me...

1498
01:56:15,701 --> 01:56:17,862
...not to use my car until
this operation is through...

1499
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,794
Thanks Mate! That'll be all...

1500
01:56:20,006 --> 01:56:21,871
Kenny! Gita left the house keys...

1501
01:56:22,308 --> 01:56:23,639
Oh! Thanks...

1502
01:56:25,511 --> 01:56:26,000
Who is he...?

1503
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:28,006
He looks a bit like you...
Your brother...?

1504
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:30,540
No, he's a friend from India...

1505
01:56:32,018 --> 01:56:34,316
Richard Ford...
- Arjun Rathore...

1506
01:56:41,694 --> 01:56:42,558
Kenny...

1507
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:43,819
Kenn... y...

1508
01:56:45,464 --> 01:56:48,831
Oh... Sorry... I...
- Hey, Gita...

1509
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:51,366
He looks just like you...

1510
01:56:51,604 --> 01:56:52,832
You're saying that too!

1511
01:56:53,806 --> 01:56:55,000
This is my wife...

1512
01:56:56,375 --> 01:56:58,002
Hi!
- HI!

1513
01:57:02,481 --> 01:57:05,712
This is the Cargo office
you are looking for...

1514
01:57:05,951 --> 01:57:07,009
Highly secured...

1515
01:57:09,055 --> 01:57:12,047
It is impossible to get in
and retrieve a parcel...

1516
01:57:12,491 --> 01:57:14,015
Can I take your order, please...?

1517
01:57:14,493 --> 01:57:16,859
2 Cappuccinos...
- Sure...

1518
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:22,995
Shiva, I know this girl...

1519
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:26,001
She visits the Pub at our Hotel...

1520
01:57:26,872 --> 01:57:28,533
What is she doing here...?

1521
01:57:29,675 --> 01:57:30,664
Excuse me...

1522
01:57:31,677 --> 01:57:34,544
Is she working with FEDEX...?

1523
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:35,442
Yes, Sir...

1524
01:57:35,681 --> 01:57:38,673
she is a FEDEX dispatch officer...
- Oh!

1525
01:57:43,889 --> 01:57:45,516
Come on, Sunny! Push it! You can do it!!

1526
01:57:45,758 --> 01:57:46,986
Push it!
- You can do it!!

1527
01:57:47,426 --> 01:57:48,916
Come on, Sunny!
- Push!

1528
01:57:50,796 --> 01:57:52,923
Sorry! You lost it!

1529
01:57:54,133 --> 01:57:54,758
Well!

1530
01:57:57,370 --> 01:57:58,462
Hard luck, Honey...

1531
01:57:59,672 --> 01:58:00,468
What's this for...?

1532
01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:02,105
It's for your train back home...

1533
01:58:07,046 --> 01:58:07,944
Can I play for you...?

1534
01:58:08,147 --> 01:58:10,479
I'll tell you what, you bet that pound

1535
01:58:10,683 --> 01:58:13,481
and I bet everything I've won tonight,
that he beat you...

1536
01:58:15,454 --> 01:58:16,113
Go!

1537
01:58:16,689 --> 01:58:18,122
Go... Go... Push him!

1538
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:22,119
Go! Come on, Man!! Push him!

1539
01:58:22,928 --> 01:58:24,691
Come on! Push him out!

1540
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:28,559
Go!
- Yes!! Push him out, now! -Yes!

1541
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:31,133
Yes!
- The money is all yours!

1542
01:58:32,805 --> 01:58:34,670
Thank you!
- Hey! - Get lost!

1543
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:36,134
This is for your train back home!

1544
01:58:39,178 --> 01:58:41,043
It's such a great day...

1545
01:58:41,947 --> 01:58:43,972
I can't thank you
enough for this help...

1546
01:58:44,617 --> 01:58:45,811
I need your help too...

1547
01:58:49,889 --> 01:58:50,981
From what Andrea says,

1548
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:52,817
our cargo will reach the
warehouse by this evening...

1549
01:58:55,494 --> 01:58:57,052
Hence, the Operation
has to happen today...

1550
01:58:57,496 --> 01:58:58,827
It's not that easy...

1551
01:58:59,031 --> 01:59:03,866
They have 8 surveillance cameras
outside and 24 of them inside...

1552
01:59:04,103 --> 01:59:05,593
We need to freeze those cameras...

1553
01:59:07,506 --> 01:59:08,598
We need a hacker...

1554
01:59:10,109 --> 01:59:12,077
When do you want this to be done...?
- Today...

1555
01:59:12,511 --> 01:59:13,705
It'll cost you 10,000 pounds...

1556
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:21,017
The cameras have to freeze
at 10 o'clock tonight...

1557
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:22,016
They will...

1558
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:23,888
This is the plan of our Operation...

1559
01:59:24,123 --> 01:59:27,092
All shops at Battersea
Square wind up at 9pm...

1560
01:59:27,526 --> 01:59:28,720
Except for this Coffee Shop...

1561
01:59:29,128 --> 01:59:31,619
You'll have to wait here...

1562
01:59:32,998 --> 01:59:36,195
Hello, Sir... Cappuccino
again or something else...

1563
01:59:37,002 --> 01:59:37,730
Cappuccino...

1564
01:59:37,903 --> 01:59:42,772
Andrea will wait for you at the Back
entrance of the Cargo Office at 9:45...

1565
01:59:43,008 --> 01:59:46,205
I am ready... I am here...
- Ya...

1566
01:59:51,016 --> 01:59:52,449
After that,

1567
01:59:52,685 --> 01:59:54,915
Victor will crash the server
exactly at 10pm and freeze the camera...

1568
01:59:55,154 --> 01:59:59,591
Get ready... 3... 2... 1...

1569
01:59:59,792 --> 02:00:02,056
System crashed... All Cameras frozen...

1570
02:00:02,895 --> 02:00:04,590
The Police will receive information

1571
02:00:04,797 --> 02:00:06,128
within 5 minutes of
the camera freezing...

1572
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:10,760
It will take them 10
minutes to get there...

1573
02:00:10,936 --> 02:00:15,771
Hence, this Operation will
have to get done in 9 minutes...

1574
02:00:20,112 --> 02:00:21,238
Come! Come! Quickly!

1575
02:00:22,815 --> 02:00:23,782
Come on! Quick!

1576
02:00:24,583 --> 02:00:25,607
Come on!

1577
02:00:29,522 --> 02:00:30,147
This way...

1578
02:00:33,526 --> 02:00:35,824
What's the Address...?
- St. James Square...

1579
02:00:36,061 --> 02:00:39,622
St. James Square... East London... lt's here...

1580
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:43,693
It says "SW21 "...

1581
02:00:48,207 --> 02:00:49,640
Quick!

1582
02:00:50,075 --> 02:00:52,703
We have time!! Relax!

1583
02:00:52,945 --> 02:00:54,105
The Cops are coming...
- What?

1584
02:00:54,947 --> 02:00:57,108
They are coming now! Quick!

1585
02:00:57,316 --> 02:01:01,719
Quick!
- Ya! Just a second...

1586
02:01:01,954 --> 02:01:04,184
I got to go!! I Sorry, I got to go!!

1587
02:01:04,423 --> 02:01:05,447
Andrea, Wait!
- Sorry!

1588
02:01:05,658 --> 02:01:07,626
Wait a second... Where
are you going...? Andrea!

1589
02:02:34,847 --> 02:02:36,007
You two, search him thoroughly...

1590
02:02:36,215 --> 02:02:38,080
Ok... Fine...

1591
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:40,007
Moving out in 10 minutes,
we've got him...

1592
02:02:55,234 --> 02:02:57,092
At 10:05, when the Operation is over,

1593
02:02:57,536 --> 02:03:00,562
when you finish, Richard Ford will be

1594
02:03:00,773 --> 02:03:03,207
waiting for you at the Back Entrance...

1595
02:03:05,745 --> 02:03:07,339
I'll pick you up... No worries...

1596
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:09,881
Just take your time...
I'll wait for you...

1597
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:33,129
If you give me permission,

1598
02:03:33,906 --> 02:03:36,670
I can go to London and
bring back the parcel...

1599
02:03:36,909 --> 02:03:39,810
Just as much as a British
Intelligence Officer is a spy here,

1600
02:03:40,045 --> 02:03:43,674
You will also be a spy,
when you go there...

1601
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:44,610
Take care...

1602
02:03:44,850 --> 02:03:47,785
3... 2... 1...

1603
02:03:58,597 --> 02:04:00,258
Excuse me, Can I help you...?

1604
02:04:00,966 --> 02:04:01,694
Kenny...?

1605
02:04:01,934 --> 02:04:03,697
Kenny...? There's no
one here called Kenny...

1606
02:04:03,936 --> 02:04:05,631
Kenny, his wife Gita...

1607
02:04:05,838 --> 02:04:07,169
I stayed with them
for a couple of days...

1608
02:04:07,606 --> 02:04:08,971
What's going on here?

1609
02:04:09,208 --> 02:04:10,641
He is asking about Kenny...

1610
02:04:10,943 --> 02:04:12,843
There's no Kenny here...

1611
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:14,636
I was staying with them...

1612
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,849
I think I have to ask you to leave...
I'm terribly sorry...

1613
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:19,814
But... I am... Excuse me...

1614
02:04:20,886 --> 02:04:23,821
Richard Ford... There's no
Richard Ford... She is my Boss...

1615
02:04:24,623 --> 02:04:25,954
She owns the shop...

1616
02:04:27,226 --> 02:04:29,194
Hey, Man! This is a Car Rental...

1617
02:04:29,628 --> 02:04:31,186
A hundred people come and go in a day...

1618
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:33,120
There's no Richard here, you know...

1619
02:04:59,592 --> 02:05:01,685
The cameras have to freeze...
- They will...

1620
02:05:02,995 --> 02:05:04,860
I'll pick you up... No worries...

1621
02:05:14,139 --> 02:05:15,037
I am sorry... I can't do this...

1622
02:05:15,274 --> 02:05:17,333
I've got to go!! I am sorry!
I've got to go!

1623
02:05:19,378 --> 02:05:22,711
Our operation will have
to be done in 9 minutes...

1624
02:05:22,915 --> 02:05:26,351
The Cops are coming... They
are coming now! Quick!

1625
02:05:33,859 --> 02:05:35,759
Hey! You! Stay there!

1626
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:37,585
Hey! Stop there!

1627
02:05:38,965 --> 02:05:40,222
Hey!!

1628
02:05:48,073 --> 02:05:49,268
Male, 5'4", heading
towards Trafalgar Square...

1629
02:05:49,809 --> 02:05:51,037
riding a Black BMX bike,

1630
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:53,937
wearing a Black leather
jacket and Khaki trousers...

1631
02:06:22,841 --> 02:06:25,867
Male, 5'4", making his
way down the steps...

1632
02:07:19,765 --> 02:07:20,891
Forgive me, Shiva...

1633
02:07:22,034 --> 02:07:24,059
I knew you would come here...

1634
02:07:24,303 --> 02:07:26,134
...and that these things would happen...

1635
02:07:26,405 --> 02:07:27,895
Who gave you instructions...?

1636
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:31,136
I don't know... I would
only receive phone calls...

1637
02:07:31,376 --> 02:07:32,900
If I didn't do what
they wanted me to...

1638
02:07:33,846 --> 02:07:36,076
...they would have killed my wife...
- Gita...?

1639
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:39,375
The lady you saw was not my Gita...
She was one of them...

1640
02:07:41,286 --> 02:07:43,083
You will kill this man...

1641
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:52,956
Yes, you will...

1642
02:07:53,198 --> 02:07:55,826
They'd held my wife hostage...

1643
02:07:56,068 --> 02:07:57,399
They sent her only this morning...

1644
02:07:58,537 --> 02:08:04,840
I came back to rescue you
after getting her home safely...

1645
02:08:06,211 --> 02:08:07,769
Which number did they call you from...?

1646
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:11,780
I tried tracing the number,
but couldn't...

1647
02:08:15,087 --> 02:08:16,850
That Flow Chart didn't come to London...

1648
02:08:58,263 --> 02:08:59,025
Excuse me, Sir...

1649
02:08:59,264 --> 02:09:01,357
I am afraid you can't go in there...

1650
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,500
We're here for the Restaurant...

1651
02:09:03,936 --> 02:09:05,233
The Restaurant's over there, Sir...

1652
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:05,293
Shiva, how are you?

1653
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:07,430
Sharath, listen to me carefully...

1654
02:10:07,566 --> 02:10:08,430
I've been framed,

1655
02:10:08,667 --> 02:10:11,431
Call up Mr. Ravi... - What are you saying?

1656
02:10:11,570 --> 02:10:15,301
The pen drive we came in search of
does not have the Flow Chart... - Then?

1657
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:17,235
Everything looks planned here...

1658
02:10:18,143 --> 02:10:20,577
On one side I have the
London Police after me...

1659
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:21,308
...and on the other;

1660
02:10:21,546 --> 02:10:23,537
someone is selling that
Flow Chart to Terrorists...

1661
02:10:24,216 --> 02:10:25,308
Shiva, how is this possible...

1662
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:29,077
Call up the Minister right away
and inform the British Government...

1663
02:10:34,459 --> 02:10:37,428
Shiva, are you there?

1664
02:10:38,697 --> 02:10:39,425
Are you there?

1665
02:10:40,699 --> 02:10:42,564
Tell me where you are right now...?

1666
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:27,478
Is Sharath the man
behind all of this...?

1667
02:11:31,416 --> 02:11:36,183
Back in Delhi, he was my friend,
family and guide...

1668
02:11:36,421 --> 02:11:38,048
Are there many people behind this...?

1669
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:40,053
You are risking your life
and doing this instead of me...

1670
02:11:40,292 --> 02:11:41,987
You were the one who
gave my life back to me...

1671
02:12:00,645 --> 02:12:03,671
Are you going to make a call to the
Minister or to Mr. Ravichandran...?

1672
02:12:04,116 --> 02:12:05,174
Why did you do this...?

1673
02:12:06,685 --> 02:12:09,552
I did it... for Money...

1674
02:12:09,788 --> 02:12:11,346
Just for mere money...?

1675
02:12:11,556 --> 02:12:15,515
This "mere" money you are
talking about caused my son's death...

1676
02:12:16,661 --> 02:12:20,188
What did this Department give me
for being honest and hardworking...?

1677
02:12:21,133 --> 02:12:22,430
Always Number 2...

1678
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,536
And I've never been
recognized for my hard work...

1679
02:12:25,704 --> 02:12:27,194
Best of Luck!

1680
02:12:30,342 --> 02:12:34,039
That's when I got a call...
My ray of hope...

1681
02:12:34,346 --> 02:12:35,040
Hello!

1682
02:12:35,247 --> 02:12:37,044
This Case was yours...

1683
02:12:37,249 --> 02:12:38,113
I came here for you...

1684
02:12:38,350 --> 02:12:39,248
That is exactly what I am saying...

1685
02:12:39,484 --> 02:12:41,111
Why did you butt in unnecessarily...?

1686
02:12:41,353 --> 02:12:42,581
Things have been going wrong
only because you came in...

1687
02:12:42,821 --> 02:12:44,379
What about the Flow Chart...?

1688
02:12:44,589 --> 02:12:48,457
Yes... The Flow Chart was with me...

1689
02:12:54,232 --> 02:12:56,792
Just when things were going on smoothly,

1690
02:12:57,235 --> 02:12:58,793
You came in and disrupted it...

1691
02:12:59,237 --> 02:13:00,465
Where is the Flow Chart...?

1692
02:13:00,705 --> 02:13:02,434
My Department knows you are here...

1693
02:13:05,177 --> 02:13:06,337
They'll never catch me...

1694
02:13:06,578 --> 02:13:08,341
If they catch me,

1695
02:13:10,382 --> 02:13:11,576
They catch you...

1696
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:13,444
Then, I'll have to kill you...

1697
02:13:15,253 --> 02:13:17,619
You need money... You need me...

1698
02:13:17,856 --> 02:13:19,118
I need money...

1699
02:13:20,392 --> 02:13:21,757
But, I don't need you anymore...

1700
02:13:30,869 --> 02:13:33,303
Your Ml6 friends asked me
to say "Good Bye" to you...

1701
02:13:50,422 --> 02:13:51,855
If I had let him go alive,

1702
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:58,627
you would have figured out
everything in India and arrested me...

1703
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:00,855
Because, Friendship is
not important to you...

1704
02:14:01,299 --> 02:14:02,664
For you, it's always
Duty and Service first...

1705
02:14:02,901 --> 02:14:04,528
But, I am not like that...

1706
02:14:04,769 --> 02:14:07,533
When you stepped in unnecessarily,

1707
02:14:07,772 --> 02:14:11,640
I wanted to make sure Steven
or his people don't harm you...

1708
02:14:11,843 --> 02:14:12,867
Hence, I devised a plan...

1709
02:14:13,311 --> 02:14:16,212
...and sent a dummy pen drive
to London and sent you here...

1710
02:14:17,215 --> 02:14:17,681
See you...

1711
02:14:17,916 --> 02:14:20,817
My counter operation was
to have you arrested...

1712
02:14:21,219 --> 02:14:25,883
...and keep you in a safe place
till our Transaction was over...

1713
02:14:26,324 --> 02:14:27,552
I always wanted to save you...

1714
02:14:27,692 --> 02:14:31,526
Hey! I don't want this
"Life" that you helped save...

1715
02:14:32,664 --> 02:14:33,688
I will show the
world your true colors...

1716
02:14:33,932 --> 02:14:35,365
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!

1717
02:14:35,567 --> 02:14:37,558
Why don't you understand...?
Come with me...

1718
02:14:37,736 --> 02:14:40,569
You will get an unimaginably
fabulous life and wealth...

1719
02:14:40,805 --> 02:14:42,534
Even talking to you is a Sin...

1720
02:14:43,808 --> 02:14:45,207
You'd better surrender...

1721
02:14:46,811 --> 02:14:48,244
You can atleast go back alive...

1722
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:51,381
I did it... just forget about it now!

1723
02:14:51,583 --> 02:14:53,574
Will you kill a friend...?

1724
02:14:53,818 --> 02:14:57,549
Don't Sharath... Just surrender...
Your game is over...

1725
02:14:57,822 --> 02:14:58,686
If you kill me...

1726
02:15:00,692 --> 02:15:01,556
Who'll be there for Asha...?

1727
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:05,693
Don't try and get away by using Asha...

1728
02:15:05,897 --> 02:15:07,728
I am not going to fall
for those sentiments...

1729
02:15:07,966 --> 02:15:10,560
Who is it on the phone, Bro...?
Is it Shiva...?

1730
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:12,595
Meena...?

1731
02:15:12,837 --> 02:15:17,274
No.. Did you come just now...?
- Yes...

1732
02:15:17,509 --> 02:15:18,567
Are you done with shopping...?

1733
02:15:19,611 --> 02:15:20,407
Sharath!

1734
02:15:20,645 --> 02:15:21,942
Did you get to know where Shiva is...?

1735
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:23,574
No...
- Sharath!

1736
02:15:23,748 --> 02:15:26,273
I'm talking to someone
who is in touch with him...

1737
02:15:26,518 --> 02:15:29,578
He must have got information about you
coming all the way for his birthday...

1738
02:15:29,754 --> 02:15:32,587
He will definitely be
here tomorrow, won't he...?

1739
02:15:32,757 --> 02:15:33,883
He will definitely come...

1740
02:15:35,293 --> 02:15:36,487
If he misses seeing you tomorrow,

1741
02:15:37,395 --> 02:15:39,260
he knows he may not
be able to see you soon...

1742
02:15:41,466 --> 02:15:41,898
Yeah!

1743
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,765
Sharath, don't do this...

1744
02:15:44,002 --> 02:15:44,969
Don't add to the list of
things you are doing wrong...

1745
02:15:45,403 --> 02:15:48,736
Please tell Shiva to come to the
Tower Bridge at 8am, tomorrow...

1746
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:50,908
His wife will be waiting for him...

1747
02:15:51,343 --> 02:15:54,437
Sharath, don't pull Meena in to this...

1748
02:15:54,679 --> 02:15:57,910
If he is amidst something important,
don't disturb him...

1749
02:15:58,883 --> 02:16:00,441
He may be a Senior Officer

1750
02:16:01,653 --> 02:16:03,917
but he is fully entitled
to love and affection...

1751
02:16:04,656 --> 02:16:06,453
Make sure you go to the
Tower Bridge at 8 tomorrow...

1752
02:16:06,658 --> 02:16:08,285
Sharath!!

1753
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:09,925
Shiva will be waiting for you...

1754
02:17:03,381 --> 02:17:10,048
My dearest... In your eyes
I wish to see my face!

1755
02:17:10,488 --> 02:17:13,821
Even in my sleep, I want to stay awake

1756
02:17:14,025 --> 02:17:17,586
And see you appear in my dreams!

1757
02:17:17,829 --> 02:17:24,735
In love, I have now become a Swing,
swaying in the breeze...

1758
02:17:24,969 --> 02:17:32,535
I want to live beyond my time,
that's all I have to ask!

1759
02:18:26,564 --> 02:18:33,128
The railway tracks are
estranged only to traverse a distance...

1760
02:18:33,571 --> 02:18:40,670
The moon rises in the west so
I can look for you within me!

1761
02:18:40,912 --> 02:18:47,818
Should I treat you
like a five year old...?

1762
02:18:47,986 --> 02:18:54,619
Should I plant affectionate
kisses all over your cheeks and face...?

1763
02:18:54,826 --> 02:19:01,925
For the present and the future
this boon of love is enough!

1764
02:19:02,133 --> 02:19:09,801
Even after death, this
memory will last forever...

1765
02:19:24,222 --> 02:19:31,185
My dearest... In your eyes
I wish to see my face!

1766
02:19:31,629 --> 02:19:34,860
Even in my sleep, I want to stay awake

1767
02:19:35,099 --> 02:19:38,660
And see you appear in my dreams!

1768
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:45,876
In love, I have now become a Swing,
swaying in the breeze...

1769
02:19:46,010 --> 02:19:53,974
I want to live beyond my time,
that's all I have to ask!

1770
02:20:37,795 --> 02:20:38,762
Meena...

1771
02:20:58,616 --> 02:20:59,947
Sharath hasn't come...

1772
02:21:00,184 --> 02:21:02,118
If he's sent her alone,
that only means he has a plan...

1773
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:05,589
Shiva, please wait...

1774
02:21:06,958 --> 02:21:08,289
You have several
surveillance Cameras here...

1775
02:21:08,726 --> 02:21:09,920
The Police might see you...

1776
02:21:10,328 --> 02:21:12,592
I'll bring her...
- Be careful...

1777
02:21:40,758 --> 02:21:41,782
Hey!! Kenny!

1778
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:45,626
Kenny!

1779
02:22:11,255 --> 02:22:13,985
Meena, don't come... Go Back!

1780
02:22:18,796 --> 02:22:20,127
No!!!

1781
02:23:35,273 --> 02:23:37,901
Sir, Shivakumar in his greed for money,

1782
02:23:38,109 --> 02:23:40,077
...took the Flow Chart
from the Cargo office...

1783
02:23:40,244 --> 02:23:42,906
And sold our Military
secrets to a Terrorist group...

1784
02:23:43,114 --> 02:23:44,081
He has not only failed in his duty...

1785
02:23:44,248 --> 02:23:46,375
...but has also disgraced our Country...

1786
02:23:46,818 --> 02:23:48,217
Where is Shivakumar...?

1787
02:23:49,253 --> 02:23:50,083
Sir...

1788
02:23:50,354 --> 02:23:51,912
Sir...

1789
02:23:52,156 --> 02:23:56,115
His wrong deed led to his wife
and him dying in that very blast...

1790
02:23:56,294 --> 02:23:57,386
Here are the Reports...

1791
02:24:00,364 --> 02:24:01,388
What a disgrace!!!

1792
02:24:01,799 --> 02:24:02,925
Had it been me, I would have
committed suicide in shame...

1793
02:24:03,134 --> 02:24:05,932
Don't talk nonsense!
Do you know what happened there?

1794
02:24:06,137 --> 02:24:07,126
The Newspapers have all the details...

1795
02:24:07,371 --> 02:24:10,135
Do Newspapers always
give you the truth...?

1796
02:24:10,308 --> 02:24:13,106
Uncle, don't argue with them...
- Don't talk without knowing what it really is...

1797
02:24:13,277 --> 02:24:16,474
Uncle, let them be... leave it... come...
- Talking too much...

1798
02:24:16,914 --> 02:24:19,781
We are hurt already...

1799
02:24:20,818 --> 02:24:21,477
Sister...
- Mom...

1800
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:23,418
Mom...

1801
02:24:24,288 --> 02:24:25,118
Mom...

1802
02:24:25,923 --> 02:24:28,255
Mom...

1803
02:25:09,333 --> 02:25:11,995
Excuse me! Do you know this man...?

1804
02:25:16,307 --> 02:25:17,831
May I have his name...?

1805
02:25:21,579 --> 02:25:22,477
Kenny!

1806
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:23,844
Kenny Thomas!

1807
02:25:24,448 --> 02:25:25,847
Thank you...

1808
02:25:31,355 --> 02:25:33,186
Very good... Ok...

1809
02:25:45,903 --> 02:25:48,201
Target Number 4... Jessica...

1810
02:25:59,383 --> 02:26:04,218
My husband, Shiva's wife
and several others,

1811
02:26:04,388 --> 02:26:06,583
paid the price for
their selfish motives...

1812
02:26:07,024 --> 02:26:10,585
They couldn't be brought to courts
because of the lack of evidence...

1813
02:26:11,028 --> 02:26:15,522
We decided to annihilate
Injustice with Justice...

1814
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:18,231
Did he get away because of us...?

1815
02:26:18,936 --> 02:26:22,235
You didn't help Victor get away... we did...

1816
02:26:23,174 --> 02:26:26,234
He knows that I will come
here only if you get away...

1817
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:27,377
What do we do now?

1818
02:26:36,187 --> 02:26:38,155
If the London Police
get their hands on Shiva,

1819
02:26:39,023 --> 02:26:40,320
It is not just he who will be caught...

1820
02:26:40,558 --> 02:26:41,616
All of us will be caught...

1821
02:26:42,293 --> 02:26:46,627
We have to get Shiva before they do...

1822
02:26:47,632 --> 02:26:49,395
If he can do all of this without vision,

1823
02:26:51,202 --> 02:26:52,499
that only means he is not alone in this...

1824
02:26:55,306 --> 02:26:57,001
There is someone helping him...

1825
02:26:58,910 --> 02:27:00,172
Mrs. Gita Kenny...?

1826
02:27:00,378 --> 02:27:01,069
That's right!

1827
02:27:01,312 --> 02:27:03,075
Someone came in about 2 hours ago...

1828
02:27:03,447 --> 02:27:05,506
...asking the same question
about Mrs. Gita Kenny...

1829
02:27:05,917 --> 02:27:07,009
May I know who that was?

1830
02:27:07,218 --> 02:27:09,186
I am Sorry, that's confidential...

1831
02:27:13,324 --> 02:27:16,657
Someone is looking for Shiva
far more fervently than us...

1832
02:27:17,929 --> 02:27:18,554
Gita is not here...

1833
02:27:18,996 --> 02:27:21,362
Don't know where she is;
don't know how to follow her...

1834
02:27:21,599 --> 02:27:23,191
We don't have to follow Gita...

1835
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:26,098
It is enough to find
out who is following us...

1836
02:27:26,337 --> 02:27:29,238
I've got information that the
Police are following this case keenly...

1837
02:27:29,473 --> 02:27:30,565
Hence, you don't get too involved...

1838
02:27:31,008 --> 02:27:32,032
I'll take care of this...

1839
02:27:34,011 --> 02:27:35,535
Driver, go to the Factory...

1840
02:27:49,026 --> 02:27:49,685
Please come...

1841
02:27:51,295 --> 02:27:52,227
This is my Factory...

1842
02:27:52,964 --> 02:27:54,397
It's a very safe place...

1843
02:27:55,266 --> 02:27:57,063
You can stay here without any hassles...

1844
02:27:58,035 --> 02:28:00,560
No one can come here
without my knowledge...

1845
02:28:05,609 --> 02:28:07,406
Gita... Shit!!

1846
02:28:09,046 --> 02:28:11,241
Security! Stop the Black Car...

1847
02:28:11,515 --> 02:28:12,573
Victor...

1848
02:28:18,389 --> 02:28:21,085
We'll have to use Gita to find Shiva...

1849
02:28:26,297 --> 02:28:28,595
We've got important information...

1850
02:28:28,766 --> 02:28:30,256
We have to leave immediately...

1851
02:28:30,534 --> 02:28:32,434
We have to let the
Control Room know immediately...

1852
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:34,604
What is the information, Sir...?
- Victor...

1853
02:28:35,406 --> 02:28:37,169
The Skyways Steel Factory owner...
Is it that Victor...?

1854
02:28:37,408 --> 02:28:39,603
He became the owner only last year...

1855
02:28:40,544 --> 02:28:41,442
Before that,

1856
02:28:41,645 --> 02:28:43,442
Victor and the 3 other
people who were killed by Shiva...

1857
02:28:43,647 --> 02:28:47,174
...worked with Ml6,
as undercover agents...

1858
02:28:47,418 --> 02:28:48,976
I knew that even earlier...

1859
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,120
But, when I enquired
Victor the last time...

1860
02:28:51,355 --> 02:28:53,619
I was surprised he
said he didn't know...

1861
02:28:53,791 --> 02:28:54,985
...the 3 other people who were murdered...

1862
02:28:55,226 --> 02:28:56,523
That's when I let go
of Shiva's trail...

1863
02:28:56,761 --> 02:28:57,659
...and started checking on Victor...

1864
02:28:58,095 --> 02:29:01,189
I wanted to keep track of his
whereabouts without his knowledge;

1865
02:29:01,432 --> 02:29:03,195
I got a Bug fixed in his car...

1866
02:29:03,434 --> 02:29:07,302
He was the one collecting
information about Gita at the Hospital...

1867
02:29:08,339 --> 02:29:09,328
Right now, his car...

1868
02:29:09,573 --> 02:29:12,133
...has gone past City limits
and is headed towards Essex...

1869
02:29:15,212 --> 02:29:16,076
Shiva!

1870
02:29:48,579 --> 02:29:49,603
Shiva!

1871
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:54,274
Shiva!

1872
02:29:57,388 --> 02:29:58,184
What happened...?

1873
02:29:59,323 --> 02:30:02,349
Number 1: Sharath...

1874
02:30:03,694 --> 02:30:06,822
Skyways Steel Factory... East London...

1875
02:30:07,231 --> 02:30:09,563
Why did you scream...?

1876
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:13,361
Number 2: Victor...

1877
02:30:36,727 --> 02:30:37,557
Hello!

1878
02:30:37,728 --> 02:30:39,389
Sir, it's me, Karthik...

1879
02:30:39,597 --> 02:30:41,724
Mr. Veerakathy knows where Gita is...

1880
02:30:42,166 --> 02:30:43,463
Be careful...
- Shit!

1881
02:30:51,742 --> 02:30:52,868
What are you thinking about...?

1882
02:30:53,644 --> 02:30:56,704
About why I didn't kill you
there but brought you here instead...?

1883
02:30:58,716 --> 02:31:00,581
The Police know where you are...

1884
02:31:01,385 --> 02:31:03,717
By now, they would have
come there in search of you...

1885
02:31:08,192 --> 02:31:12,492
They will think you killed
Gita and got away from there...

1886
02:31:12,730 --> 02:31:16,166
No one knew you were alive...

1887
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:19,597
And now, no one will know you are dead...

1888
02:31:22,406 --> 02:31:24,499
The Police will search for you again...

1889
02:31:24,742 --> 02:31:27,768
The search will be endless...

1890
02:31:28,212 --> 02:31:31,613
There's no evidence
- Who's there...?

1891
02:31:31,782 --> 02:31:33,272
...left against us...

1892
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:37,512
Nor will you be left behind...

1893
02:31:59,443 --> 02:32:00,774
What about the Taxi driver...?

1894
02:32:03,447 --> 02:32:04,937
Where am I...?

1895
02:32:17,728 --> 02:32:19,958
Sir... The Address you wanted to go to...

1896
02:32:34,712 --> 02:32:35,804
Hello, Sir...

1897
02:32:37,414 --> 02:32:39,507
I am waiting for a Customer...

1898
02:32:39,717 --> 02:32:40,979
Isn't he your regular Customer...?

1899
02:32:42,853 --> 02:32:44,821
Sir, do you know...
- I know...

1900
02:32:46,023 --> 02:32:47,581
4+1 makes it 5...

1901
02:32:48,859 --> 02:32:50,690
But, it would amount to
one punishment anyway...

1902
02:33:00,304 --> 02:33:01,362
Victor!!

1903
02:33:03,741 --> 02:33:04,537
Victor!!

1904
02:33:23,994 --> 02:33:26,019
I don't know whether I should
feel happy that you are alive

1905
02:33:27,531 --> 02:33:30,728
Or feel sad that you are not dead...

1906
02:33:33,003 --> 02:33:34,732
Meena's death was an accident...

1907
02:33:36,774 --> 02:33:39,868
You were the reason for it...
You were too honest...

1908
02:33:40,077 --> 02:33:41,772
It's not too late even now...

1909
02:33:42,012 --> 02:33:45,880
You can live and let me live...

1910
02:38:44,748 --> 02:38:45,339
The Sky...

1911
02:38:47,184 --> 02:38:48,048
Water...

1912
02:38:50,253 --> 02:38:51,185
Air...

1913
02:38:53,090 --> 02:38:54,057
Land...

1914
02:39:03,233 --> 02:39:04,063
Gary...

1915
02:39:31,695 --> 02:39:34,789
Ravichandran, even if
Shiva has lost his vision,

1916
02:39:35,032 --> 02:39:39,230
Our Country needs his
intellect and acumen...

1917
02:39:40,370 --> 02:39:42,235
Ask him to come to India immediately...

1918
02:39:44,374 --> 02:39:46,774
Justice will be put to test...

1919
02:39:47,377 --> 02:39:49,106
But it will regain its place of pride...

1920
02:39:50,247 --> 02:39:52,238
This saying proves right in your case...

1921
02:39:53,717 --> 02:39:55,150
That all the people you killed were...

1922
02:39:55,385 --> 02:39:58,286
...Terrorists plotting
against this country,

1923
02:39:58,722 --> 02:39:59,950
...is now proven by Law...

1924
02:40:00,724 --> 02:40:06,026
Hence, this Government has
accepted the request from India

1925
02:40:06,263 --> 02:40:07,423
And is setting you free...

1926
02:40:08,065 --> 02:40:12,126
Your Department in India is
waiting for you to come back

1927
02:40:13,470 --> 02:40:15,961
as "Shiva"...the way you were...

1928
02:40:16,473 --> 02:40:17,963
The "Shiva" you are talking about...

1929
02:40:20,844 --> 02:40:22,038
...is long dead...

1930
02:40:23,413 --> 02:40:26,041
I am going to live my life...

1931
02:40:26,950 --> 02:40:28,144
...for Meena...
