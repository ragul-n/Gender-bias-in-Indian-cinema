1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,249
Mumbai

3
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,167
A station where no traveller
ever arrives alone

4
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:03,083
He always comes with a dream

5
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,874
Some suffer with him...

6
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,249
and some are lost in
the milling crowds of the city

7
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,667
This foursome has arrived at
this platform with similar dreams

8
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:19,209
"Whether they gain or lose,
is what will happen now"

9
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,209
But what happened earlier is
what we've got to tell you

10
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,374
When you know a pack of cards and
I share a childhood relationship...

11
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,457
why do you come to lose every day?

12
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:38,916
Cut

13
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,249
Looks like all I'll get
is nuts!

14
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,249
10 rupees.
- 10 rupees?

15
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,249
Here's 20

16
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,791
"Give me a kilo of rice, please!"

17
00:03:55,792 --> 00:04:00,958
The shop is closed.
Please come later

18
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,415
One minute

19
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,582
"Two kilos of wheat, please!"

20
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:10,707
"The shop is closed, I said.
Can't you understand?"

21
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,290
Father...?

22
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,791
"Run, fatso.
- Wait there, fatso..."

23
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:18,583
where are you going...?
And where are you off to?

24
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,290
You guys have started
gambling in my shop again?

25
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:27,624
I'm not sparing you!
Where are you going?

26
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,667
Wastrel! For two days
I entrust the shop to you...

27
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,250
and you turn it into a gambling den?
This is the provision shop...

28
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:39,291
that has reared you! And you
want to turn it into a gambling den?

29
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,291
"Enough, father. That's enough.
I have some respect too"

30
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,291
"Respect, my foot!
You can't earn a penny..."

31
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,291
and you talk of respect?
If gambling is your ambition...

32
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,832
"get the hell out of here!
- Oh yes, I'll go away"

33
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,916
I'm not fond of sitting in the shop.
- What are you doing?

34
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,874
Keep out of this!
- He's grown up and...

35
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,291
"Enough, Mother. Take care
of your shop. I'm leaving"

36
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,125
Get lost!

37
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,374
"Kid, the lines on your
forehead indicate..."

38
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,791
that the Saturday
between Friday and Sunday...

39
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:39,415
will bring into your life
a man...

40
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,916
who will be an obstacle
in your well-being

41
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:47,042
"But come, he surely will"

42
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,415
Where's the bridegroom?

43
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,415
"If he's so late for the engagement,
what'll he do at the wedding?"

44
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,415
I'll be back in a moment

45
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,582
Go and bring Jai.
Everyone's waiting for him

46
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:06,042
"Yes, I'll take a look"

47
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,916
"Jai, what are you doing here son?"

48
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,958
Everyone's waiting for you there
to complete the engagement ritual

49
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,582
"And you're sitting with that
girl's photograph, with a long face?"

50
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,582
"Forget her, I say"

51
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,792
"Has she contacted you even once,
ever since she went away to Mumbai?"

52
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:41,792
Did she ever write or telephone you?
But you're still mad about her

53
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,416
"My son, now dress up quickly
and come inside"

54
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:52,916
They're all waiting for you.
Okay?

55
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,165
Wonderful! Capital!

56
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:29,458
"Son, the lines on your forehead
indicate happiness and fame"

57
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,458
But you must beware
of that one man too

58
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,666
He reads faces

59
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,666
He said something similar
when he saw me too

60
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:47,375
Don't pay attention to him

61
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:56,082
"Yes, Bobby here"

62
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,541
I missed the flight.
I've just got into the train

63
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:02,040
"Yes, I'm shooting with Shah Rukh
from nine to six tomorrow..."

64
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,541
and I've got to attend
an awards nite after that

65
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,541
What? Bipasha's has given
you the shooting dates?

66
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,541
But you should know.
I don't shoot on Sundays

67
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:16,375
"You get it, don't you?"

68
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,708
Are your hands clean?
- What?

69
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,082
Are your hands clean?
- Yes... why?

70
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's shake!

71
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,582
Nice style

72
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,582
What are you reading
in the newspaper?

73
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,582
You won't ever look for a job

74
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,249
And I had hit the jackpot
the day you were born in my house!

75
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,666
So what am I to do?

76
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,542
"Ever since Shukla ran away with
your money, I've been facing the music"

77
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,582
I can't sit anywhere in peace.
- Really?

78
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,708
So why don't you go to Mumbai
and get the money back from Shukla?

79
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,791
"I gave it to him
at your say-so, didn't I?"

80
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,082
So it's my mistake?
- The two of you are fighting again?

81
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,124
He will sit here
twiddling his thumbs...

82
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,875
but he's not willing to go to Mumbai
to get my money back from Shukla

83
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,749
I don't want to go to Mumbai!
Let me tell you that!

84
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,916
Even your father will go!
- So go ahead. When did I stop you?

85
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,999
"Now look, Omi...
- Omi, go to Mumbai, my son"

86
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,165
Bring the money back and
make him shut up for good

87
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,582
"What are you saying, Ma?
Think about it!"

88
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,124
Where will I live in Mumbai?
What will I eat?

89
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,208
Don't make excuses.
I'll pay for your food and stay

90
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,124
But you're going to Mumbai!

91
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:30,083
"All right. If you insist,
I'll go away. To Mumbai"

92
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,040
"Hey, move it"

93
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:45,083
So this is dangerous one!

94
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,917
"Want a bite?
- Sure, why not?"

95
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,708
Serve a round.
- So here you are

96
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,874
"Jai, come and join us.
What are you thinking about?"

97
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,041
"I'm waiting to reach Mumbai,
so I can meet Shalini"

98
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,667
God! I can't understand
this yarn about love and romance!

99
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,041
"What rubbish, Omi!
If it wasn't for love..."

100
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,374
the world would mean nothing!

101
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,207
Did you always want
to become a film star?

102
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,667
"Couldn't help it, you know.
God gave me such a handsome face!"

103
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,041
"Bobby, didn't your father
ever object?"

104
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,915
My father?
He had just one thing to say...

105
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:13,416
"My son will one day
become Amitabh Bachchan"

106
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:17,374
You want to become Amitabh?

107
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,709
Dhanno...!
Look at this farce!

108
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:30,709
I had told you not to watch
Amitabh's movies after we got married

109
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,416
But you wouldn't listen

110
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:38,249
"And you... the moment
you were born, you said..."

111
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,874
My father is a thief

112
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,750
"Father, you have no idea!"

113
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:49,083
The future of India
stands before you!

114
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:53,082
The country needs me!

115
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,915
This buffalo-shed needs you too!

116
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,915
My two hundred buffaloes
haven't given any milk in two days

117
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,915
And there's isn't a trace
of regret on your face

118
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,125
You kept playing around.
Cricket!

119
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,332
"Cricket...?
- Yes, the cursed Cricket!"

120
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,750
"And these flashy English clothes.
- This is a "jackut"

121
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,666
It doesn't even have a sleeve!

122
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,709
I had given you such
a lovely name. Badrinath

123
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,417
But you opted
for a girl's name. Baabi!

124
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,416
"It's Bobby.
- Yes, Baabi!"

125
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,750
"Now listen carefully
to what I say, son"

126
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,082
"You aren't going
to the city, no"

127
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,790
But father...
- I've told you. That's it

128
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,541
What thoughts are you lost in?
- Is the shot ready?

129
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,750
"Absolutely, sir. The moment
Aishwarya arrives, we'll get cracking"

130
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:46,667
May I...?

131
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,750
"Jai, call Shalini.
Tell her you're on your way"

132
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,999
No.
- Why not?

133
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,249
I want to give her a surprise

134
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,249
Give me the number. Quick

135
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,459
"Wow! Nice little game
he played with us, with this toy"

136
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:07,291
He'll surely become an actor!

137
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,332
"Omi, tell me something"

138
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,374
Where will you find Shukla
in such a big city?

139
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:20,791
"I'll find even his old man!
I have a plan for that, Bobby"

140
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,166
I have a plan ready for everything

141
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:27,208
"By the way, Jai, where are
you going to put up in Mumbai?"

142
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,208
I have a close friend in Mumbai.
Jaggi. He's a real buddy

143
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,250
Really? What does he do for a living?
- He used to be a ladies' tailor earlier

144
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,874
"Now, maybe he's
gotten into politics"

145
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,957
There's a Congress House in
Grant Road. That's where he lives

146
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,541
And where are you going to put up?
- Me...?

147
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:46,208
"Actually, I have a good friend too.
Whose friend also lives in Mumbai"

148
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,541
"And you, Lucky?
- I have a friend too..."

149
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,874
whose good friend lives in Mumbai

150
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,208
Have you told your friends you're
going to live with their friends?

151
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,416
"Yes, I...
- We just told you!"

152
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:03,250
"Jaggi's such a good friend!
He won't refuse a buddy, will he?"

153
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,416
"What say, Bobby?
- Absolutely"

154
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,624
And I'm going to
live in my uncle's place

155
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:12,750
I've always been
his blue-eyed boy

156
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,082
"The glass will fall, Bobby"

157
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,875
"C'mon, Jai. Quench your thirst.
- What if it won't be quenched?"

158
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:24,833
What if you don't find Shalini?
- And what if you don't find Shukla?

159
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:30,042
And what if Bobby
doesn't become an actor?

160
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,334
There comes the moment...

161
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:19,124
that was to arrive

162
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:23,124
Here goes the moment...

163
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:27,957
that was to go by

164
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,458
There comes the moment...

165
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:37,417
that was to arrive

166
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,958
"New goals wait for you
to be conquered"

167
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:38,375
"I agree, I'm still in journey..."

168
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:45,875
"but my goal
is very much in sight"

169
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:01,249
I dream about tomorrow...

170
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,417
"there's a fragrance
in my breath"

171
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,417
"Says this my heart,
now and every time..."

172
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:14,000
Spring shall arrive some day

173
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,082
Listen...

174
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:53,583
beware of this guy

175
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:00,500
"Mister, where's Grant Road?
- Take a cab there and get on with it"

176
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,624
"Driver, let's go. Grant Road.
- Grant Road...?"

177
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,084
"Why? You've never been there?
- I have, sir"

178
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,000
So move it...

179
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:39,417
"It's terribly hot in Mumbai.
- Mumbai, after all"

180
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:47,374
Your Shalini!

181
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,957
Jai...
- Forget it

182
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,665
Hey! Stop here!
- What happened?

183
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,208
"Coconut water!
- Yes, let's have some"

184
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:00,499
You guys want some?

185
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,167
"Four coconuts, boss.
C'mon, Bobby"

186
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:09,208
A tender and big one

187
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:11,707
A big...
- Hey handsome...

188
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,208
What are you doing?

189
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:17,541
"Give me some money, handsome.
May God bless you"

190
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,208
"What's that?
- One has money, one has nothing"

191
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:25,749
Bet twenty bucks?
Guess which one has it

192
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,707
Let me have the twenty bucks.
- God! I've been robbed

193
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,749
Amazing!

194
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,249
Let's have it again.
- Again?

195
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,499
Guess which one has it

196
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,583
God! I've been robbed again!

197
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,249
Thief

198
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,916
"Want another bet?
- No, enough of your drama"

199
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:50,249
"Try your luck, I say.
- No thanks. I've had enough"

200
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,583
"This is what I'm in Mumbai for.
- How do you always win, Lucky?"

201
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,249
"Lucky's lucky, you know"

202
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,083
To Grant Road now

203
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,166
Damn it! The same signal again!

204
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,415
We get stuck at the same signal
every day. Isn't it?

205
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:12,709
"Right, sir.
That's the problem with Mumbai"

206
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:17,457
"Jai, you said Jaggi's place was
just ten minutes away from the station"

207
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,415
"Yes, and we've been driving around
for the last three hours"

208
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:25,417
That's what he told me

209
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,249
"Hey, we left Shalini General
Stores behind. How did it come again?"

210
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,666
Look at that!

211
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,374
"Sir, have your friends
just arrived in Mumbai?"

212
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,290
We have a Shalini General Stores
at every signal here

213
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,582
"You ought to know that, isn't it?
- Oh yes, I know everything"

214
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,791
Just look ahead and drive.
- Sure

215
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:49,167
"Don't worry, guys.
We're headed in the right direction"

216
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,458
"Was this the address Jaggi gave?
- Yes, he did say Grant Road"

217
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,667
"Here's Congress House, sir.
- Right!"

218
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,042
"So how much is the fare?
- 300 Rupees, sir"

219
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,332
What...?
We keep coming here every day

220
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,332
It doesn't cost more than 250
rupees to get here from the station

221
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,332
"All right, sir.
Give it to me"

222
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,999
Hey hunk... come here

223
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,999
Sister... could you tell us
where we'll find Jaggi?

224
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,708
Why look for Jaggi?
You can have it even without him

225
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,624
"You'll have to pay him,
so will l"

226
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:45,374
So let's strike a deal

227
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,374
"What's that about the deal, aunty...?
- C'mon!"

228
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,374
What happened?

229
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,791
Look!

230
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,374
Watch your step!

231
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,874
What place is this?

232
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,541
You want to run us over?

233
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:08,374
You think this is
your old man's road...?

234
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,041
Jai! You...?

235
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,541
Jaggi!

236
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,374
How are you doing...?
- First class

237
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,415
Let me introduce my friends to you.
These guys are my friends

238
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:22,250
This is Jaggi

239
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,249
What's all this Jaggi?
Such a big car!

240
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,415
You've been going places!

241
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,791
What sort of a pimp are you?

242
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:34,207
"What's he saying, Jaggi?
- I... I'll explain"

243
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,750
I've been waiting and waiting!
Where's the new item you promised?

244
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,750
"Gracy's in the car, she will
be coming, sir. Wait a few moments"

245
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:45,415
"Hello, Jaggi..."

246
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,582
You're a real connoisseur!
So how much will it be?

247
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,916
"Five.
- Make it four, please"

248
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,415
"Sir, you make hay as
long as you feel young"

249
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,833
"After our retirement,
we've got to pay up"

250
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,916
So you pay up now.
- Here you are...

251
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:01,042
"Put it away. Don't count it!
- You're special, sir..."

252
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:06,916
get in the car

253
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,165
"Come on, I'll explain"

254
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:14,792
That guy who left with Gracy
in the car calls me a pimp...

255
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,415
"but otherwise, he calls me his son.
Guess why"

256
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,541
Why?
- Because I'm the son...

257
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:22,457
who gets a new mummy
every night

258
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,457
Beware of two kinds of people.
- Like?

259
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,624
Five cups of tea. Quick

260
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,958
"What sort of people?
- The gangsters, to begin with"

261
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:34,207
"Why would we get involved
with the gangsters, Jaggi?"

262
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,165
And who are the others?
- Everyone you meet

263
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,417
How about pimps? Mustn't one
keep his distance from them?

264
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,749
"Jai, that I'm a pimp
is the bitter truth"

265
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,582
You guys tell me
what wrong I'm doing

266
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,707
"People in the village respect me,
my mother's proud of me"

267
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,833
"Ask him, I got a house
built in the village..."

268
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,457
"I bought a bike for my kid brother,
got my kid sister married..."

269
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,874
what else does one need in life?
The moral of the story is...

270
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,499
the goat is slain
because people eat it up

271
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,499
Why blame the poor butcher?

272
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,582
Right.
- Makes sense

273
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,374
"By the way, that moneybags
was a real caricature, Jaggi!"

274
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,499
They come in all shapes and sizes!

275
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,499
You'll be stunned
when you hear the stories

276
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,749
There was this ascetic.
He was bowled over by a girl

277
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,499
I had it all settled and
he went into the room with her

278
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,499
"After a little while, he came out
and started to leave"

279
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,874
"The girl said,
Baba... the money?"

280
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,833
Guess what he said to her?

281
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,875
"Silly girl!
I won't take any from you!"

282
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,541
Let me take you to your room

283
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:37,875
"Sleep if you want to. If you want
to keep awake, I'll send Sona over"

284
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,874
That's a nice idea

285
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,040
I must go to
my uncle's place too. Okay?

286
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,582
"Okay, Bobby!
See you on the big screen now!"

287
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,541
"And don't forget the tips I gave you
if you ever play a gambler, Bobby"

288
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:51,416
I won't

289
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,500
You...? He's the cabbie
who brought us here just now

290
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:58,166
He asked for 300 bucks.
But I wouldn't fall for it!

291
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,999
I paid him only 250!

292
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,374
250 bucks instead of 20...?
Scoundrel!

293
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,582
They're my friends.
Take them where they want to go

294
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:10,249
And don't take any money
- Let's go

295
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,582
Let me show you the room.
It has the works

296
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,582
"Jaggi, what's up there?
- Paradise"

297
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,249
Pushpa! Haven't you gone yet?
- Jaggi-bhai...

298
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,749
"Dharam seth wants to see you.
- Wait, I'll come"

299
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,749
"Friends, I've
got to attend to a client"

300
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,542
There's a great room up ahead.
Have fun... do what you want to

301
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:40,583
"Lucky, this sure
is a great place"

302
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:46,249
Wow!

303
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,417
"Jai, your Jaggi's
really an amazing guy"

304
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,957
You don't mean...?

305
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:58,582
I'm going!
- To the room next door?

306
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,874
Stop kidding!
- Sit down

307
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,916
What sit down?
How can we stay here?

308
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:05,666
Where else will we go?
- Let's stay in a hotel

309
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,582
"In a week's time, we'll run
out of money and have to return home"

310
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,374
"In that case, let's go to
Bobby's uncle's house"

311
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:17,375
"Are you coming? Or must I go alone?
- Let's go, damn it!"

312
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,749
What happened?

313
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,915
Speak up!

314
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:47,625
Silence!
I'm the third emperor!

315
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:51,958
And you... you're
out to become Amitabh Bachchan?

316
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:55,666
I sent you a wire...

317
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,666
I even telephoned...

318
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,666
"Come over, son, I said"

319
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,875
Your uncle's blood
isn't a lemonade...

320
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:07,041
"any Tom, Dick
or Harry can feast on"

321
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:15,792
"Uncle, you are talking
to the future of India"

322
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,915
Silence!

323
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:22,416
Let's spend the night here.
What difference does it make?

324
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:26,249
"Oh yes, we can surely
spend a night here, what say?"

325
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,040
"Jaggi... do something
for us, please"

326
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,208
"With Jaggi on your side,
luck is in your favour"

327
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:36,000
"Spend the night here, I'll have
you guys set up tomorrow"

328
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:41,833
"The future of India,
in Congress House...?"

329
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:45,333
"When I become a star, I'll
surely mention this in my interviews"

330
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:49,249
Damn you!

331
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,749
"You guys have just
arrived in Mumbai, Jai..."

332
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,749
but I have enough clout here

333
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,624
"Your work will be done,
take it from me"

334
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:02,832
Recognise him?

335
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:08,208
Jaggi! Isn't he the moneybags
with that babe last night?

336
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,082
"No, it can't be him.
Must be twin-brothers"

337
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:16,166
"Oh yes, like
the Corsican Brothers!"

338
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,624
Strange! One brother
prays by the day...

339
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,999
"and by night,
the other one..."

340
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,209
Hello Chamak Uncle!

341
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,082
What are you doing here?

342
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,416
I wanted to introduce
my friends to you

343
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,708
What will I do with
an introduction to your friends?

344
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:37,082
"Actually, they wanted to thank you"

345
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,749
What for...?
What have I done?

346
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,416
"For giving them a place
to stay in Mumbai, of course"

347
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,749
"Now look, Jaggi!
Don't try to act very smart..."

348
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,957
I'm warning you!
Don't act very smart!

349
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,874
Who is it...?
- No one...

350
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:51,207
"they're from the orphanage,
asking for a donation"

351
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,082
You go on inside. Go

352
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,124
And you... take your friends
and get going. Go away

353
00:28:56,125 --> 00:29:02,375
"All right, but Gracy
wanted your wife's address"

354
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:06,249
"If you want to take,
you must also give, sir..."

355
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,790
"You aren't doing right!
- All right, we'll go away"

356
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,790
I told you!
Your work will be done

357
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:16,874
Take your friends
and get out of my sight!

358
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:21,749
Get going...
my wife might come out

359
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,749
"Jaggi, that old man didn't
give you the wrong address, did he?"

360
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,790
Oh no. Champak Seth has several
such vacant flats locked up in Mumbai

361
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:31,166
"But a deposit of 100,000?
- A rent of 10,000!"

362
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:34,832
You agreed to it?!
- Why're you worried about the dough?

363
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:38,832
I'll handle Champak Uncle

364
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:42,249
Wow! What a place!
Fully furnished

365
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,624
When someone doesn't
pay Champak Uncle the rent...

366
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:48,791
he brings all their stuff here.
It's all yours...

367
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:52,499
Make merry!
The whole building belongs to you!

368
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,499
"If you still don't like it,
my room's always available. What say?"

369
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,583
No thanks!
This place is good enough for us

370
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:01,832
But thanks for asking.
- You talk like a kid

371
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,499
"Thank God, if you must"

372
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,458
He holds the key
to everyone's destiny

373
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:49,124
Bombay is mine!

374
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,249
Looks like our hero's drunk

375
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,249
What are your plans for tomorrow?

376
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,334
I'll find Shukla and
give him such a thrashing...

377
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:01,915
he'll remember me all his life!
- This guy's going to beat up Shukla...

378
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:04,249
the hero's going
to meet his director...

379
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,166
and the lover boy's
going after his girl!

380
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:11,542
"Lucky, that's our plan.
What's your's?"

381
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,707
I want to win over
the whole of Mumbai

382
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,915
And Jaggi's going
to set it up for me

383
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,124
Not to worry.
I'll show you the den...

384
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,915
rob them all and disappear!

385
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,915
Why do you keep looking
at your watch all the time?

386
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:32,875
"You don't understand, Jai!
She must've given it to him! Right?"

387
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:34,915
Tell us

388
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:36,749
What's the time then?

389
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:42,583
Let's say cheers to that...

390
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:48,084
I think I will leave now

391
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,582
Omi... you?

392
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,083
Scoundrel!
How dare you con my father?

393
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:05,291
"Speak up, or else...
- Yes, I dared to!"

394
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:10,541
But I got the courage
from your plan!

395
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:11,957
Come on

396
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:13,957
How did your journey go?

397
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,957
"Boss, I've been waiting
for three hours"

398
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,082
When will I get to see the director?
- You see this guy?

399
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,999
He's been waiting for three years.
- Three years...?

400
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,999
"I'm in love, love..."

401
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,166
with Hindi movies

402
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:29,958
"Father asked me to leave the house,
Paro asked me to forget the movies"

403
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:33,333
And you ask me to stop waiting?

404
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:39,708
I must wait... I must!

405
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,749
I want to meet Atma-ji

406
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,082
You'll have to wait
for a long time

407
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,124
I've been waiting for three hours

408
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:36,540
It's not easy
to meet Atma-saheb

409
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:41,082
You're here to
become a film star?

410
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,749
Any doubts?
- No

411
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,416
I'm sort of used to it.
- To what?

412
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:50,333
To all those guys who
come here to become film stars

413
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:53,082
What do you mean?
What do I lack?

414
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,416
"I have a nice face,
a good body, height..."

415
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,082
a nice voice

416
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,624
Can't I become an actor?

417
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:05,540
"Madam, you've been called inside"

418
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:10,708
"You have a nice face,
height, body and a voice..."

419
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:14,875
but you don't have
what I have

420
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:22,082
I object! I object!

421
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:25,041
I told my father
that I'd have Shukla's blood

422
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,416
And here I am.
Enjoying your beer!

423
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,041
"But the plan was
a superhit, wasn't it?"

424
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,124
"Okay, but what are you going
to tell your father when you go back?"

425
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:35,708
What's there to say?
I'll say Shukla swallowed our money...

426
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:39,124
and the city of Mumbai
swallowed Shukla!

427
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,124
Stop laughing now
and give me my share

428
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,416
It's kept for you.
- So how about a look at Mumbai?

429
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,749
"Hello, sir.
I'm Bobby. From Allahabad"

430
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,124
So go back!

431
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,124
"Did you see "Chandni Bar"?
I'll make you win the National Award"

432
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:59,333
My style of film-making
is a bit different

433
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,249
A penny for your thoughts!

434
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,125
"Know what, Vicky?
Every time she came to meet me..."

435
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:11,083
she used to bring flowers for me

436
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:14,583
"She was so lovable, so simple...
I can't describe it"

437
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:19,125
She used to cook something for me
everyday and made sure I ate it

438
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:25,166
That day when we met
for the last time...

439
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:31,625
I can't ever forget that evening.
Never

440
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,167
"There's something my heart
has been wanting to tell you..."

441
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,167
"There's something my heart
has been wanting to tell you..."

442
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,541
since last night

443
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:39,209
"There's something my heart
has been wanting to tell you..."

444
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,541
since last night

445
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:16,042
"Look at the magic
of our meeting..."

446
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,541
"in every season it appears
to be pouring love"

447
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:31,416
"You are the one in my memories,
you have driven my sleep away..."

448
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,415
I was so Ionely...

449
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:37,290
"until I spoke to you, my love"

450
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:41,250
"Why did I feel as if
you were with me..."

451
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:45,541
since last night

452
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:28,084
"Your smile,
your alluring shyness..."

453
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:33,333
"how will I ever lavish praise
on my beautiful beloved?"

454
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,415
My feet stagger...

455
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:44,290
what kick is this?

456
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:48,917
"Whether you say it or not,
something is sure to happen"

457
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:53,708
"Either you or I have
done something wrong..."

458
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:58,333
ever since last night

459
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:08,708
"There's something my heart
has been wanting to tell you..."

460
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:42,083
"Gave you a jolt, didn't I?
- You, Jai?"

461
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:45,208
"Honestly, I came over because
I couldn't live without you"

462
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:49,375
"Know what? I've bored my friends
to death, talking about you"

463
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,249
This is my friend Lucky.
We're staying together in Mumbai

464
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,624
And this is Shalu

465
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,749
"You've changed so much, Shalu"

466
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,541
"Jai, I've got to go somewhere"

467
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,457
Hey! How can you
go away like this?

468
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:07,374
I've come all this way for you
and you're talking about leaving?

469
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:11,541
"Try to understand, Jai."

470
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:16,249
Maybe I won't see you
before you return

471
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,582
But Shalu...

472
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:23,917
"You were right, Jai.
I have changed"

473
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:32,083
"Forget it, Jai.
She's Shalini, all right..."

474
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:37,166
but she's not the Shalu you loved.
Let's go

475
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:52,042
"How often must I tell you that
Atma-ji is busy? Go away now, please"

476
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,499
These guys really
drive us out of our minds

477
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,125
"Atma-ji, your story is amazing.
But my costumes...?"

478
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,582
Sapna! Just don't
worry about the costumes

479
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,499
I have the best of
technicians from Hollywood...

480
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,749
the best choreographer of India...

481
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,874
Atma-ji! It's Bobby!
I've come from Allahabad

482
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:12,791
So go back

483
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:15,874
Come and see me
once I complete this schedule

484
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,666
Out of my way!

485
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:21,874
You land up every time
I come to meet Atma-ji

486
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,874
What are you getting at?

487
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,541
I don't know when
I'll be in the thick of the action

488
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,834
"Relax, buddy. No tension.
Care for some coffee?"

489
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:18,500
"Lucky, let's go"

490
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:25,375
May I?
- Go ahead

491
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,666
"Forget it, Jai.
Such things happen in life"

492
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,582
What's happened is in the past.
Forget it

493
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:38,750
"Yes, forget it. In any case,
that girl wasn't worthy of you"

494
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,582
That's what I've been trying
to explain. But he won't understand

495
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:46,208
"Thanks... thanks, .
- Thanks? What for?"

496
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,582
You guys are really
standing by me

497
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:51,332
"Hey! I'm the guy from
the movies, or is it you?"

498
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:55,000
"He's using movie-lines!
- You needn't go back home, okay?"

499
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,291
No. No one can make me
change my decision

500
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:03,916
"Until there is water in the sea,
there will always be fishes"

501
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,165
Champak's wife has
gone to her parents'. So...

502
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:10,124
Mend your ways
while there is time

503
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,207
You can become
a ladies' tailor all over again

504
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:17,084
"Forget about him, will you?"

505
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:48,166
"If she could agree to play
my heroine, I'd have a blast!"

506
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,292
"Bobby! Don't stand in my way,
or it'll ruin our friendship!"

507
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:56,040
"Boss, what's a beautiful girl
like her doing here all alone?"

508
00:43:56,041 --> 00:44:01,500
"Waiting for her hero, what else?"

509
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,875
"Bobby, she's looking at me.
- Sorry, she's looking at me!"

510
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,834
Hey! It's not the three of us!
She's looking at Jai

511
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:18,958
You had to pull my leg?

512
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:21,708
"Jai, Bobby's speaking the truth
for the first ever time"

513
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,416
Looks like you've hit the jackpot!

514
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,667
Want me to set it up for you...?
- Lay off! Not every girl is like that

515
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:30,333
Now do as I say.
Relax...

516
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,333
"in style, give her a smile.
Go on. Give her a smile"

517
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:43,333
No... how can I...?
It's wrong

518
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,749
She's inviting you.
If you don't take the hint...

519
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:52,792
you'll stand in a queue
all your life!

520
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:55,749
She's calling me over!
What should I do?

521
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,749
Go and ask her if
she'll be your sister!

522
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,749
C'mon Jai! Do we have
to explain everything to you?

523
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,915
Maybe Shalini has broken your heart

524
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,790
But that doesn't mean
you'll stop living! Go on!

525
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:10,209
Go!

526
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,749
Do you come here every day?
- Some times

527
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,749
"And you?
- Some times, too"

528
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,040
I'm glad.
- About what?

529
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:39,874
That those who came here
some times chose to come here today

530
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,790
Bet a hundred?
He's not returning home tomorrow

531
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,957
"Oh no, Jai's a real simpleton"

532
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:48,915
That he is.
But the girl packs a punch

533
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:51,416
What are we guys going to do?
Sit around?

534
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:54,124
"As long as we hang around,
he won't talk to her freely"

535
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:59,583
So let's go

536
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:28,832
"My love, give me a place
in your heart"

537
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:32,459
"I'm the one you dream about,
take me for your own"

538
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,416
"It's because
of your romantic ways..."

539
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:38,999
"it's because of
the way my heart is..."

540
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,125
let's bring our hearts together

541
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:41,459
Revel in the carnival of love

542
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:46,208
"What are you thinking about?
Take me in your arms"

543
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:49,832
I consent...

544
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,458
I love you...

545
00:47:52,459 --> 00:47:55,875
"enjoy this high
love gives you"

546
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:25,375
"You are always
immersed in thought"

547
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:30,292
"But there is so much
your silent lips say to me"

548
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:35,917
"Be not silent, my love.
Here's your chance, say something"

549
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:39,917
Enjoy your life while you can

550
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,999
What are you doing?

551
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,082
I normally collect
the money in advance

552
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:11,292
But your friends asked me
to collect it in the morning

553
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:15,541
"I liked the way you look,
so I agreed"

554
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,999
You mean you...?

555
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,999
You mean my friends...?

556
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,416
You mean you...?

557
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,540
"You aren't winning this game, my boy.
Let's have a show"

558
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,582
Here you are.
- Damn it!

559
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:30,333
You must lose at least sometime!

560
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:33,416
Did you find Shukla?
- I'm going to kill the three of you!

561
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:37,666
Who do you think you are? You sent
me with a girl who's a...

562
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:41,124
You've shown what sort of
friends you are! You've shown it!

563
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:44,041
"Skip the drama! You had a
great time last night, didn't you?"

564
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,208
"And, did you look at the watch?
- Damn the watch!"

565
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:48,916
Let's talk about my 5000 rupees.
- To hell with 5000 rupees!

566
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:52,166
Tell us... was it fun?
- Tell us... was it fun?

567
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:58,500
Speak... was it fun?

568
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,041
Lover boy!

569
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:03,707
It was great fun!
- Look at him blushing!

570
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:09,166
So... are you going back home?

571
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,082
"Doubtful, I say. Very doubtful
- Let me have my hundred bucks"

572
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:17,249
Forgot to ask you...
did you find Shukla?

573
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:21,458
Why wouldn't I?
He was sitting on my share

574
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:25,708
Who has the courage to
rob my father without my help?

575
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:31,249
You're such a scoundrel!

576
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,957
"That, I am"

577
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,082
"There's money in the pocket,
it's a sunny day..."

578
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:37,249
and the future of India
is still sitting at home?

579
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,958
Let's go!

580
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:54,582
We're a crazy lot...

581
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:58,999
"on our lips
is the song of mischief"

582
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,500
"We will do
our heart's bidding..."

583
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,457
"we'll pluck the stars
from the skies"

584
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:11,042
"This much our heart says,
now and every time..."

585
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:15,375
"what have we to do
with unsated pining?"

586
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:37,084
There comes the moment...

587
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:42,457
that was to arrive

588
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:45,917
Here goes the moment...

589
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:51,166
that was to go by

590
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,666
There comes the moment...

591
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,957
that was to arrive

592
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:03,125
Here goes the moment...

593
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:08,249
that was to go by

594
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,292
"New goals wait for you
to be conquered"

595
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:44,958
"29, 30, 31...
Only 3400 rupees? Is that all?"

596
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:49,167
"The clothes were pretty expensive!
- Lucky, listen to this one!"

597
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,750
The future of India's broke!
- That was inevitable!

598
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,499
"Because there was money in
his pocket, he had a great day"

599
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,916
And now India's future
sits at home

600
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,249
"Yes, I'm running out of money too"

601
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,875
And I haven't found a break yet.
I've regularly been doing the rounds

602
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,540
Looks like we'll have to return home.
- Have you gone mad?

603
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,916
"If I could help it,
I'd never go back home"

604
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:13,624
"I'd sit here and have fun.
- To have fun, you need cash"

605
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:17,167
"True. Think of a way, Omi.
You must surely have a plan?"

606
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,291
I do!
- And what is the plan?

607
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:22,832
You are my plan!
- Me!

608
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:26,541
"Whenever you need money, you play
a couple of rounds and make the money"

609
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:29,582
You're the one who's going to make
the programme for us to live in Mumbai

610
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:33,249
"You forget, Omi. I've only been
a small-time gambler till now"

611
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,374
"For the amount of money you want,
I'll have to play big-time"

612
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:39,875
"And to play big-time,
your 3400 rupees is a bit too little"

613
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:43,666
"I'd need at least 15,000.
Fifteen grand"

614
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:46,874
"15,000?"

615
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:50,209
"Whatever I have, Lucky,
I'm staking on you"

616
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:01,374
Have you guys gone mad?
What if Lucky loses?

617
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,290
Lucky never loses!
That's what the plan is all about

618
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:07,583
"And you think it's a nice plan?
- Not just nice, it's a great plan!"

619
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:13,958
You guys are going
to get me killed. I'm sure

620
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:20,000
Here you are.
- Count it! Let's see how much we have

621
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:27,417
"13,000. We're still short of 2,000"

622
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:08,374
All right.
I'll talk to you later

623
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,750
"Hello, Mr Lucky. How are you?
0 Fine, thank you, Aslam-bhai"

624
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,374
"Here's 15,000"

625
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:17,457
"Planning to play it big today?
- Yes, just for the heck of it"

626
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:20,041
So come and gamble with me.
- You?

627
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:23,333
"Yes, Who gambles
big-time nowadays anyway?"

628
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:27,374
"Besides, it's ages
since I gambled"

629
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:30,165
As you wish

630
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:33,583
"Will your friends gamble too?
- No, they're here for some drinks"

631
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,374
So let's go...
- Let's

632
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:39,207
Send the counters to us

633
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:44,625
You guys have some drinks.
I'll be with you soon

634
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,874
"Omi, are you sure Lucky will win?
He won't lose, will he?"

635
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:17,041
Why do you always say
inauspicious things?

636
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,499
"All right, I'm sorry.
I'll talk about something else"

637
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,708
"Let's talk about Tanya.
- You're obsessed with love, are you?"

638
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:26,415
We got you and Tanya together
to exorcise you of the ghost of love

639
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,707
"And you...
- Forget about all that, buddy"

640
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:34,500
Today belongs
to India's future!

641
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:49,457
"Lucky, what happened?
- Lucky never loses, my friend"

642
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:51,999
"You've won, so you're leaving?
- This much is enough for today"

643
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,457
"100,000 could turn into a million.
- A million?"

644
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,999
"Yes, that is if you
can trust your destiny"

645
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,165
No destiny!
We have trust in Lucky!

646
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,457
"Go ahead and play it, Lucky!
- Enough"

647
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:03,874
For a little while more.
Go on!

648
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,124
May I?

649
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:10,542
You're going to hit the jackpot.
Go ahead!

650
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,833
Your stake

651
00:57:57,834 --> 00:58:03,750
I've run out of money.
- You will have the money

652
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:39,167
"700,000"

653
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:47,624
"7 days, 700,000"

654
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:53,750
"You guys live
on Champak's terrace, right?"

655
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:09,582
Why're you guys glaring at me?
What have I done?

656
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:12,541
That soothsayer
warned us so many times

657
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,666
I see! So it's my mistake?

658
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:16,708
Am I the one who lost
the money or was it Lucky?

659
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:20,166
So you mean it happened
because of me? It's my mistake?

660
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,499
"No, no.
It's no one else's mistake"

661
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,624
It's my mistake
that I listened to you

662
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:28,249
I had told everyone of you
to give it a good thought

663
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,374
But you guys then thought
we didn't have another choice

664
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:34,624
What are we going to do? Where
will we get so much of money from?

665
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:39,624
We don't even know
anyone in this city

666
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:45,791
Jaggi! Our Jaggi!

667
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:49,416
When did this happen?
- 3 days ago

668
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:53,333
What are we to do? That blackie'll
find each one of us and kill us

669
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:56,957
So who asked you to act smart
and gamble?

670
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:59,624
"You're screwed now, aren't you?"

671
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:02,541
I can't do anything. They've
levelled serious charges against me

672
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:05,040
How serious?
- I don't know

673
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:10,833
I could spend a week here
or even a month

674
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:19,958
Why're you guys so tense?
There's surely going to be a way

675
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:22,749
Sure there is.
Let's take a jump from here

676
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,541
We'll go down
and jump to the heavens

677
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:29,165
Why can't we return to our towns?
- That won't help

678
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:32,915
"Wherever we go, we can't
run away from them"

679
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:37,625
"Yes, Lucky is right. They must be
keeping an eye on us all the time"

680
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:42,708
There's only one way out

681
01:00:42,709 --> 01:00:46,000
"Come what may, we'll have to raise
700,000 in the next 7 days"

682
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:50,708
I'll have to think of a plan.
- You're not thinking about anything!

683
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:54,000
All our lives are in danger.
We'll think of what is to be done

684
01:00:54,916 --> 01:01:00,708
All right!
So think of a way out!

685
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:21,667
I'm the one who lost the money.
The rest of you can run away

686
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:26,791
"Have you gone mad, Lucky?
Must we leave you and run away?"

687
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,749
You were actually winning...

688
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,749
but we insisted that
you keep gambling

689
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,375
"Hey Lucky, we're all
into this together. Okay?"

690
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:38,667
But what are we going to do?
I can't figure out anything

691
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,874
May I say something now?

692
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:49,375
Have you read this
morning's newspaper?

693
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:54,915
Take a look

694
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:57,832
"Are you in your senses, Omi?
You're asking us to do this?"

695
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:00,749
Nothing's going to happen!
Take a look at that

696
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,416
The businessman has gone back home
and there's no trace of the kidnapper

697
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,541
There was a pay off
of 20 million involved

698
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:08,499
"And all we need
is just 700,000"

699
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,249
"We'll play Aslam-bhai 700,000
and save our lives"

700
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,832
We can then leave this city
and go back to our homes

701
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:18,041
"Omi, it's a nice plan"

702
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:22,790
You've gone mad.
You guys have gone crazy

703
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:26,790
All right. So you tell us
if you have a better plan

704
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:30,083
"It's makes no difference whether
it's your plan or mine, Jai"

705
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:36,833
"We've got to save the lives
of all four of us, right?"

706
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:50,292
How are we going to do the kidnapping?
And whom will we abduct?

707
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:54,041
"Let's kidnap any rich man.
- No, Bobby. No"

708
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,208
"We'll have to find a man who has
enough money, but no fame"

709
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:03,749
Where will we find such a man?
- At the Golden Bar

710
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,208
"That will come later. To begin with,
we'll have to plan it meticulously"

711
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,749
"Where we'll get in from,
from where we'll leave with him..."

712
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,166
we'll have to think of everything.
- But who is this man?

713
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,166
He appears to be a rich businessman

714
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:19,791
"I saw him at the Golden Bar,
when I went there with Shukla"

715
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,832
"Like every night,
he'll visit that place even tonight"

716
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,291
Is he very rich?

717
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:28,499
He blows up a couple of hundred
thousands in a single night

718
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,874
"He's so rich, when his car
halts at the Golden Bar's gates..."

719
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:36,833
the public is stunned

720
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:51,333
He has a style that isn't
any lesser than a film star's

721
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,874
When he gets out of the car...

722
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:03,000
he says nothing.
It's his money that does the talking

723
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:18,208
"He's the one.
Our bearer cheque of 700,000"

724
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,999
My eyes...

725
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,207
your beauty...

726
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:33,915
I admire you...

727
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:39,708
for you are my beautiful maiden

728
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:09,875
"The intoxication in your eyes,
makes you conceited..."

729
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:15,374
it all comes pouring

730
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:19,583
"It's the dot on my forehead
that has robbed you of your sleep..."

731
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,416
every time it has shone

732
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:24,957
"I've lost my peace
ever since I've met you"

733
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:29,250
"My love, my beloved is here...
all dressed, decked up for me"

734
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:35,124
I'm crazy...

735
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,458
for love

736
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:39,707
I'd even lay down my life...

737
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,041
if you asked me to

738
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,707
I've given my heart...

739
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,874
in exchange for yours

740
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:49,124
Why must I seek...

741
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,540
"your life, my love?"

742
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,041
"If there be life.
There shall be love"

743
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:57,208
"In love, we find solace"

744
01:06:57,209 --> 01:07:01,583
"My love, my beloved is here...
all dressed, decked up for me"

745
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,540
I'm a carefree soul...

746
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:41,082
I make merry

747
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:44,875
"Love is what
I talk about"

748
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:49,708
"You are the one
I talk about"

749
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:54,042
"For you, I live every day.
And I die every day"

750
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:57,916
"You are the
one I stand before..."

751
01:07:57,917 --> 01:08:00,874
"every moment, every day"

752
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:05,084
"My love, my beloved is here...
all dressed, decked up for me"

753
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:41,957
Done already?

754
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:45,125
"When I saw you for the first time,
it was already done then"

755
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:48,833
"Moosa, it's okay when you
utter obscenities, not niceties"

756
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:53,041
I'm glad there's something
you find nice about me

757
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,374
But when you dance
before the world...

758
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:58,499
Moosa doesn't like it.
Let's go

759
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,707
Really?
And where will you keep me?

760
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,374
I'll keep you in a palace

761
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:05,208
But you will live
in my heart

762
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:07,582
Will you marry me?

763
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:09,916
"There you go again, Rani...
- Again what, Moosa?"

764
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:13,666
"I've told you, I want
to go with you and I will"

765
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,791
But only as your wife

766
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:19,208
How often have I told you
that I don't want get married!

767
01:09:19,209 --> 01:09:21,540
You can have
anything else you want

768
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:25,540
"Cars, bungalows, money...
name it!"

769
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:28,208
Anyone here can give me
all that

770
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:31,124
"But what I seek,
only you can give me"

771
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,707
But you don't want
to give it to me!

772
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,833
"Now look, Rani...!
Listen to me..."

773
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:38,707
"You better listen to me, Moosa.
If you can't be my groom..."

774
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:42,167
you can put away this gun.
And stop thinking of taking me away

775
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:48,417
Let's go

776
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:54,292
Will you use force with me?

777
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:15,374
"One thing I must
compliment you for, Moosa"

778
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:18,999
You're very loyal.
To Ali-bhai

779
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,291
I recollect a couplet
on loyalty. Listen

780
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,832
"I'm glad
I was unfaithful, my love..."

781
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:36,415
"For, it's only dogs
that are loyal"

782
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:40,541
They're all dogs!
Who...?

783
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:44,708
"From the fish-market, you've got
to become the crocodile of the docks"

784
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:51,791
But you haven't gotten over
your habit of being crass

785
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:02,374
Moosa! Sultan!

786
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:07,833
Don't forget whose threshold
you're standing at!

787
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:13,625
You've escaped

788
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,290
Of all the colours
I've seen in the world...

789
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:19,290
it's Ali-bhai's court that
sees the gangsters assemble

790
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:23,290
Sultan!

791
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,374
I've called the two of you
to tell you...

792
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:29,374
that I've had enough
of your personal enmity

793
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,374
"He killed two of your men,
and you killed four of his"

794
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:35,708
"If you keep killing one another,
what are the cops getting paid for?"

795
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:42,999
You guys are doing
the work of the police?

796
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,750
"Henceforth, the two of you
will not stand in each other's path"

797
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:50,624
You will take my advise.
Won't you Moosa?

798
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:53,833
"It won't be Moosa to
fire the first round, Ali-bhai"

799
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:56,499
But how about him?

800
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,666
"All right, all right"

801
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:02,583
"Rather I get into a no-entry zone,
but I won't cross his path"

802
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,375
All right. Shake hands
and compromise

803
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:18,875
God will bless you

804
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:28,416
You escaped because of
the old man today. Tomorrow...

805
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,624
One moment

806
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:35,417
"You're fond of poetry, aren't you?
So listen to a couplet"

807
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:39,874
I listen to Ali-bhai

808
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:42,457
You listen to Ali-bhai

809
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,457
"But don't take
that old man seriously"

810
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:51,666
Always beware of Moosa

811
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:56,791
So we're all going to
the Golden Bar tonight

812
01:13:56,792 --> 01:14:00,290
Has everyone understood the plan?
- Now look...

813
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:04,125
think while there's time.
It's a very dangerous plan

814
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,499
"What danger, Jai? What?"

815
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,207
He must be the spoilt son
of a filthy rich businessman!

816
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:13,458
He mustn't have killed a fly in
his lifetime. What will he do to us?

817
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,499
"Relax, Jai.
Just you see..."

818
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,625
kidnapping him
is going to be child's play

819
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:26,708
What say?
Shall we go?

820
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:38,874
What did you go to Moosa for?

821
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,457
But I haven't been to Moosa!

822
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,791
Your car was seen there
on four occasions

823
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:47,208
"I swear, I didn't go to Moosa.
- You speak lies!"

824
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:59,332
You've been screwing my brains
for the last ten minutes

825
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,457
"He went to Moosa,
his car was seen there..."

826
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,666
"you knew he went there,
didn't you?"

827
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:11,125
Moosa broke one of our men.
You break one of his

828
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,999
Bump him off

829
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,541
And Sultan will make
Moosa-bhai out of you

830
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:20,125
Moosa's going to Golden Bar today.
But he's not coming back

831
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,750
Get to work

832
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:33,499
"After Moosa-bhai,
it's gonna be bhoosa-bhai (hay)"

833
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:38,750
That's nice. Bhoosa-bhai!

834
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:43,207
Moosa will surely
go to Golden Bar tonight

835
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:45,416
And no one's
going to accompany him

836
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:51,334
We made a good collection
yesterday. Today...

837
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:14,541
"Why do you drink so much, Moosa?
I've told you so often..."

838
01:16:14,542 --> 01:16:18,875
The mood's very smooth today.
- So? You're going to dance?

839
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:23,541
And what will I do?

840
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:28,292
You...

841
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:40,791
What's all this?

842
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:44,374
What do you think?
Your hands and feet are tied...

843
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:47,750
"neither are we your relatives,
nor are you in your drawing room"

844
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:51,249
We have kidnapped you

845
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:54,124
Give us the telephone number
of your wife

846
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:55,832
I haven't one

847
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:58,166
Give us your father's number then

848
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,166
No

849
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:03,374
What? No father?
Or no number?

850
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:04,416
Both

851
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:05,832
If you haven't a father...

852
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:08,207
"you must have a brother,
uncle, manager... someone?"

853
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:11,333
You're such a big businessman.
You must atleast have a secretary?

854
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,708
Now give it to us quickly

855
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:15,915
You guys have no clue...

856
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:19,166
how you've screwed yourselves
by bringing me here

857
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:24,832
Really? You could tell us then
what a big shot you are

858
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,915
Moosa. You heard of Moosa?

859
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,624
You'll now tell us
that you're Moosa's man

860
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:33,915
You think we guys are morons?

861
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,207
I'm not Moosa's man...

862
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:40,957
I'm Moosa himself

863
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:46,207
The next time you
raise your hand at me...

864
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:51,207
"I'll cut it off
and shove it up yours, okay?"

865
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:54,333
Try threatening us
and you'll get a whack!

866
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,040
"Before you do that,
do yourself a favour"

867
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:02,332
"Go to any police station,
any police station..."

868
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,874
and look up the board
of the most wanted men

869
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,957
"Yes, we will go"

870
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:09,207
But only after we
get the dough from you

871
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:12,542
But what are we going to lose
in taking a look anyway?

872
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:16,208
Hey! He threatens us
and you lose your nerve?

873
01:19:16,542 --> 01:19:18,708
But why take the risk?
- What risk?

874
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:21,040
Look at him. Does he look like
a gangster from any angle?

875
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:24,500
"A Rolex watch,
an Armani suit..."

876
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:28,667
and Gucci shoes. He looks less a
gangster and more like John Travolta!

877
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:32,125
"Relax, Bobby. Let him go.
It'll make for his morning walk"

878
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:36,374
Go on

879
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:40,249
What do you monkeys think?
That chimp's coming back?

880
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,541
He will. He's our friend

881
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:47,875
Amazing friends.
They want to die together

882
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:54,041
Everyone in this country thinks
he can become an actor

883
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:56,249
That's where you lost it

884
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:59,542
"If you had to play a gangster,
you should've done it properly"

885
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:04,875
Well... I'll show you
how to play a gangster

886
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:10,957
Look carefully

887
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:15,250
Take a look at this chain.
It's 500 grams!

888
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:22,916
And this is a rod. What?
A rod

889
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:29,208
And this is a magazine.
This is the trigger

890
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:35,250
"Place a finger on the trigger,
and aim the gun at anyone you wish to"

891
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:42,292
Press the trigger and... boom!
End of the story

892
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,665
Why's Lucky so late?
- Omi...

893
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,999
Think of him and he's here.
- Listen to me...

894
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,207
Look at our hero acting!
- Listen to me...

895
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:59,125
"It's great fun. Sit down.
- Listen to me, I say!"

896
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:23,374
"Forgive us, brother!
We made a mistake!"

897
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:26,082
First undo my hands!

898
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,624
What are you guys doing?
Have you gone mad?

899
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:30,374
Set him free and
he'll kill all of us!

900
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:34,250
I kept harping on 500 grams.
And you even slapped him!

901
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:36,707
You're a deadman!
- But how was I to know...?

902
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,374
"I'm sorry, did it hurt...?
- Hey! If you touch me..."

903
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:42,666
I know. You'll shove it up mine.
- What are we going to do now?

904
01:21:43,042 --> 01:21:45,458
One moment!
I think I have another plan...

905
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:47,832
Shut up! You aren't
thinking of anything now!

906
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:50,041
Yes! You're the one who fixed
our appointment with death!

907
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:51,041
I did...?

908
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:54,417
Here's Jaggi to share
the problems of his friends

909
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,833
Now who's the one
who has been tormenting you?

910
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:06,665
"Brother! Give them an easy death!
They're my friends, brother!"

911
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:12,125
Undo my hands first!

912
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:38,124
How did you guys
kidnap me?

913
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:41,417
"Actually, I got to know that
you visit Golden Bar every day"

914
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:45,499
We made you sniff at
a bit of chloroform

915
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,374
You had had
a lot to drink anyway

916
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:51,082
How about my men?
- Men...?

917
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:56,124
There was no one there

918
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:59,208
"Kiddo, brother doesn't have
special security"

919
01:22:59,209 --> 01:23:01,999
"But it's still the tightest.
What say, brother?"

920
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,999
"But there was
no one there, Jaggi"

921
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,458
"Yes, Moosa-bhai. What would
we gain out of lying to you?"

922
01:23:06,459 --> 01:23:09,750
Send that chimp here.
- Which one?

923
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:14,665
Hey hero...

924
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:20,125
Go on. Brother's calling you

925
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:22,458
"You're very fond
of acting, aren't you?"

926
01:23:22,459 --> 01:23:26,083
Now call my men and tell them
that I'm in your custody. Go on

927
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:29,499
What are you standing for?
Bhai's asking you to call!

928
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,790
"Make the call,
whatever it is..."

929
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:35,291
Hey! Keep your mouth shut!

930
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:38,459
Sit down here.
And make the call. Go on

931
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:50,208
This is your boss's boss

932
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:55,459
"If you wish to see Moosa alive,
you... you..."

933
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:00,832
Arrange for 40 million

934
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:04,208
Arrange for 40 million

935
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:07,292
"Where to bring the dough and when,
I'll tell you"

936
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:11,875
"Where to bring the dough and when,
I'll tell you"

937
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:17,249
Stay close to the phone.
I'll call again

938
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:20,417
Stay close to the phone.
I'll call again

939
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:26,208
This hero...

940
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:28,665
he's staying with me

941
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:32,874
"The three of you will go
to pick up the money, okay?"

942
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:37,208
IMAX-Adlabs

943
01:24:37,209 --> 01:24:41,540
"The moment you enter,
you must go different ways"

944
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:44,792
"Akbar's all alone in the world,
but he won't really be alone"

945
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:10,500
Make a call to Akbar from there

946
01:25:14,084 --> 01:25:18,041
"After that, send Akbar
in a twirl"

947
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:21,249
"To get into trains and cinema houses
without a ticket, is against the law"

948
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,249
Don't you know that?

949
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:28,249
"Hurry up and give us three tickets.
- Sorry, sir. It's a full house"

950
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:34,542
Vacate three seats or I'll
empty all six slugs in your skull

951
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:45,583
Get rid of the guys with you.
This movie isn't meant for kids

952
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:50,707
Good boy

953
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:54,208
Welcome to IMAX

954
01:25:54,209 --> 01:25:58,625
"Like a good boy,
do as I say"

955
01:26:00,042 --> 01:26:02,374
Akbar does what he wants to!

956
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:08,250
Really? I can see the sweat on
your brow in the viewfinder of my gun

957
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:15,542
Want me to wipe it?

958
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,666
Now listen carefully

959
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:22,250
Stop ogling at the girls.
They're your daughter's age

960
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:27,332
What next?
- Turn right

961
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:32,792
And take the escalator up

962
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:48,999
You're up?
- Ask him to go down again

963
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,832
Now take the staircase down

964
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:54,125
"Up and down, up and down!
What next?"

965
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:58,959
Want to go to hell straightaway?
Now go to the escalator

966
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:09,833
Now keep the bag
on the escalator and turn around

967
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:17,041
Now?

968
01:27:17,042 --> 01:27:22,208
I'll bump you off
if you turn around now

969
01:27:22,209 --> 01:27:25,083
Now?
- Wait

970
01:27:25,084 --> 01:27:28,124
Now?
- Wait

971
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:32,374
"Now?
- Wait, I said"

972
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:33,415
And now?

973
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:36,791
What are you waiting for?
The drama's over

974
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:39,374
"You have a ticket, don't you?
They're still showing the movie"

975
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:44,208
Go and watch it

976
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:53,749
We haven't done anything!
- We haven't even touched the bag!

977
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:59,833
We did just what
you asked us to do!

978
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:11,541
Moosa here

979
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:19,375
Moosa! Moosa!
I looked high and low...

980
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:24,042
"where are you hiding
from Sultan, Moosa?"

981
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:32,541
I sent four of your own men
to bump you off...

982
01:28:32,542 --> 01:28:36,041
and you bolted from there

983
01:28:36,042 --> 01:28:39,582
"Instead of 40 million,
I had old newspapers sent"

984
01:28:39,583 --> 01:28:42,457
And you still escaped!

985
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:45,750
"When are you going to die, Moosa?
When?"

986
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:49,666
A rat doesn't become a tiger
just because it calls itself one

987
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:53,042
You got to sire children. You
don't become a father by adopting them

988
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:59,375
"Sultan, you're a deadman"

989
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:05,499
It was my own men

990
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,624
"Is everything okay, brother?"

991
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:14,125
Four shooters came to Golden Bar
to bump me off last night

992
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,916
"You mean, your life was saved
because of these guys?"

993
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:22,999
And that's why
they're still alive

994
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,666
So what's next?

995
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:29,125
An attack on Rani.
They know how much I love her

996
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:35,542
We must bring her here.
- What?

997
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,541
"You brought me here
as a guest, didn't you?"

998
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:41,874
I'll stay here
as your father now

999
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,582
Did...

1000
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:47,084
did Moosa pick on you clowns
to con me?

1001
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:51,541
We're speaking the truth.
Your life is in danger

1002
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:55,000
It's true. And it was Moosa-bhai
who sent us here to take you to safety

1003
01:29:55,542 --> 01:29:58,834
"Oh yes, the sight of you guys
tells me it's Moosa's doing"

1004
01:29:59,542 --> 01:30:02,667
He could never come and take
me away so he sends his sidekicks!

1005
01:30:03,042 --> 01:30:04,958
Go and tell your Moosa-bhai

1006
01:30:04,959 --> 01:30:07,207
Rani would rather die
than go like this!

1007
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:10,750
"Now don't compel us to...
- Try touching me, I'II..."

1008
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,541
I know. You'll shove it up mine

1009
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:17,500
Perfect couple! They even
speak the same sort of lines

1010
01:30:18,042 --> 01:30:21,457
That's exactly why
we love each other so much

1011
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,165
"We did our best, brother.
But she..."

1012
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:27,542
What the hell is all this?
- Come with me. I'll explain

1013
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:30,374
Anything could happen here.
- Anything's possible with you around!

1014
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,374
"You drive my customers away,
create a nuisance..."

1015
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:34,707
"and today, you send these asses here?
- There could be serious trouble, Rani!"

1016
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:40,625
"Whatever happens,
I'm not going with you!"

1017
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:32,209
Moosa-bhai! Sultan...

1018
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:38,708
Tell Sultan...

1019
01:32:38,709 --> 01:32:44,167
I'm going after him

1020
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:55,667
Neither will Moosa die
nor will he let me live in peace

1021
01:32:58,041 --> 01:33:02,958
"Tell me just this much, God.
How much will you take to kill Moosa?"

1022
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:11,541
"Go, go"

1023
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:15,708
"There's this foursome,
you don't even know"

1024
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:18,708
"There's the pimp, who has
no identity of his own"

1025
01:33:18,709 --> 01:33:21,708
"And there's me,
who doesn't know about her future"

1026
01:33:21,709 --> 01:33:24,708
"And there's you,
who doesn't care about his future"

1027
01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:30,000
So what next?

1028
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:32,874
Sultan's dead

1029
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:35,374
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

1030
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:37,249
How many of them are you
going to kill on your own?

1031
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:41,165
There's always going
to be someone who'II...

1032
01:33:41,166 --> 01:33:44,333
Listen to me.
You aren't going alone anywhere

1033
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,749
"If you must go out,
take the four of them with you"

1034
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:51,082
What? The four of them?

1035
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:54,709
I'm not going out to play marbles!
And Moosa doesn't need anyone

1036
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:59,833
At least listen to me.
Listen...

1037
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:04,375
"Rani-ji, Moosa-bhai is right.
The four of us are useless!"

1038
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:09,166
Moosa-bhai will himself face
trouble if he takes us with him

1039
01:34:09,584 --> 01:34:11,583
Look at what happened at Golden...
- Hey!

1040
01:34:11,584 --> 01:34:17,583
"When Moosa and I are talking,
nobody interferes. Get that?"

1041
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:19,791
What is your bloody problem?

1042
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:22,457
"I've been trying to make you
see reason, but you won't understand!"

1043
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:25,542
"You've gone mad, Rani! You expect me
to carry these guys in my arms?"

1044
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:28,583
"You're right, Moosa-bhai.
Make her see reason instead"

1045
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:30,666
There's no use
taking us along

1046
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,541
"Yes, Moosa-bhai.
Please let us go"

1047
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:34,332
"Shut up, will you?"

1048
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:36,499
"Moosa, I'm not
letting you to out all alone"

1049
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,166
But Rani...
- Quiet!

1050
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:40,832
Swear it on me that
you will listen to what I say

1051
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:44,374
You will take the four of them
with you. Swear it on me

1052
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:48,666
Swear it on me

1053
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:54,084
I swear it on you.
Happy?

1054
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:10,332
Why've you called me here?

1055
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:12,874
I know the four boys
who've kidnapped Moosa...

1056
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:16,459
Name the price.
- 4 million

1057
01:35:17,041 --> 01:35:19,874
Done.
- At Kyani Restaurant tomorrow

1058
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:24,500
All right

1059
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:38,874
Place an order.
I'll join you soon

1060
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:41,874
What will you guys eat?
- Mincemeat and bread

1061
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:48,125
Kyani Restaurant.
They're with me

1062
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:58,541
"Have you asked for an omelette?
- Yes, that too"

1063
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:02,167
"What are you eating, Jaggi?
- There's a problem with my stomach"

1064
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:04,249
Have something!
- No thanks

1065
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:09,708
Don't drink so much.
- Can't help it

1066
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:34,375
I'm going to the loo

1067
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,832
"You guys wanted to
kill me, didn't you?"

1068
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:30,417
So let's see whom destiny kills

1069
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:04,709
So let's see whom destiny kills

1070
01:42:05,583 --> 01:42:07,457
"That was fantastic, Moosa-bhai!"

1071
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:11,041
I haven't seen a better
action hero than you!

1072
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,209
Learn a thing or two from Moosa-bhai
if you want to become an action hero

1073
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:19,042
The action came later. But that
guy shat the moment he saw Moosa-bhai

1074
01:42:19,583 --> 01:42:23,209
"I have a question, brother.
Everyone's so scared of you..."

1075
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:29,667
They call you a thug and a gangster.
Don't you ever feel bad about it?

1076
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,083
"What's what,
what's shame...?"

1077
01:42:48,084 --> 01:42:53,542
It's a game for name

1078
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:02,332
"What's what,
what's shame...?"

1079
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:07,708
"It's a game for name,
it's all about making a name"

1080
01:43:09,667 --> 01:43:12,958
"I have a bad name.
Yet, I have all the fame"

1081
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:20,625
"That which clashes against me,
is a fallen wall"

1082
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,208
"Bully, I'm the bully"

1083
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:30,499
"What's what,
what's shame...?"

1084
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:36,167
It's a game for name

1085
01:44:05,458 --> 01:44:08,707
"This city belongs to me.
The lanes are all mine"

1086
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:12,333
"Everyone says
these buildings are all mine"

1087
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:27,333
"Whoever shakes hands with me,
has his life made"

1088
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:34,833
"Bully, I'm the bully"

1089
01:44:35,875 --> 01:44:37,749
"What's what,
what's shame...?"

1090
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:42,958
It's a game for name

1091
01:44:42,959 --> 01:44:46,375
"I have a bad name.
Yet, I have all the fame"

1092
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:18,625
"I'm the one who rules the roost,
my tentacles spread far and wide"

1093
01:45:19,042 --> 01:45:22,750
"What politicians or dons?
They're all on my side"

1094
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:29,667
"The whole of Mumbai
knows that"

1095
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:37,416
"I'm the one they
make a beeline for"

1096
01:45:38,792 --> 01:45:45,250
"Bully, I'm the bully"

1097
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:02,290
"What's what,
what's shame...?"

1098
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:05,708
"It's a game for name,
it's all about making a name"

1099
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,792
"I had a bad name.
Yet, I have all the fame"

1100
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:23,000
"Bully, I'm the bully"

1101
01:46:53,458 --> 01:46:56,457
Sultan-bhai...
Moosa's knocked off Akbar

1102
01:46:56,458 --> 01:47:00,541
"It's our turn now, Sultan-bhai"

1103
01:47:00,542 --> 01:47:03,165
"Send us underground, Sultan-bhai"

1104
01:47:03,166 --> 01:47:07,249
"If you remain here, you'll find
it difficult to breathe easily"

1105
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:11,125
"But where I'm sending you,
you don't even need to breathe"

1106
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:26,000
They're out to become dons!
Pipsqueaks!

1107
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:35,042
Pipsqueaks!

1108
01:47:39,709 --> 01:47:44,082
"You've got there?
- Yes, bhai"

1109
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:46,374
Where's he?
- Right here

1110
01:47:46,375 --> 01:47:49,582
Give him the phone.
- One minute

1111
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:54,416
Who are you? How did you get in?
- Talk to brother

1112
01:47:54,417 --> 01:48:00,375
Is your brother my old man?
- Talk to him

1113
01:48:00,417 --> 01:48:02,374
Who's this?
- Moosa

1114
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:06,624
Moosa-bhai!

1115
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:09,416
I dare do that...?

1116
01:48:09,417 --> 01:48:14,250
"Yes, I asked him to go home.
To bring his folks along..."

1117
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:17,416
he's the hero of a big film
and it's about to go on the floors!

1118
01:48:17,417 --> 01:48:20,791
"If I knew he's your kid,
I'd have made him stay in my house"

1119
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:23,749
Son... why're you standing?
Take a seat

1120
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:27,791
"Get a soft drink for the hero!
- Yes, a coke."

1121
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:31,040
"You won't believe it, brother.
The token amount's lying ready..."

1122
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:33,374
and I even sent my assistants
to look for him

1123
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:36,749
"And now that you say it, the story
and the works will be ready by tomorrow"

1124
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,666
I'll even find a heroine.
- The heroine is ready

1125
01:48:39,667 --> 01:48:42,207
"You hear that, Moosa-bhai?"

1126
01:48:42,208 --> 01:48:44,207
"What's your name, son?
- Bobby"

1127
01:48:44,208 --> 01:48:47,750
See Bobby's dedication? This boy's
going to score over everyone else!

1128
01:48:48,125 --> 01:48:50,457
What else can I ask for?
My life is made!

1129
01:48:50,458 --> 01:48:54,000
"Please don't hang up, brother.
I've got to tell you something"

1130
01:48:54,375 --> 01:48:58,125
"Having spoken to you today,
I'm reminded of the Supreme Lord!"

1131
01:49:00,542 --> 01:49:06,458
Here you are.
Moosa-bhai

1132
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,457
Where are you coming from?

1133
01:49:14,458 --> 01:49:16,249
It isn't a question
of where I'm coming from

1134
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:19,708
It has to do with where I'm going

1135
01:49:19,709 --> 01:49:24,457
Want an answer?
To VT station!

1136
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:27,708
Amit-ji was also returning to
Allahabad from VT station...

1137
01:49:27,709 --> 01:49:30,624
when Prakash Mehra
stopped him on the railway platform

1138
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:33,457
Really? And who's coming
to stop you?

1139
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:37,375
"Wait... stop there, Bobby!
I implore you in the name of my life!"

1140
01:49:37,709 --> 01:49:40,708
Atma-ji... hello

1141
01:49:40,709 --> 01:49:44,375
If you could give me an introduction
to the leading-lady you spoke about...

1142
01:49:44,709 --> 01:49:47,834
"work would become easier
for two of us, I swear"

1143
01:49:48,208 --> 01:49:51,333
"So meet your heroine, Atma-ji.
Sapna!"

1144
01:49:52,709 --> 01:49:55,499
Yes! This is the
beautiful dream-face!

1145
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:59,916
I swear! Like Dharmendra
and Hema Malini's hit pair...

1146
01:50:00,292 --> 01:50:03,541
I'll see that Bobby and Sapna
make a hit pair all over India!

1147
01:50:03,542 --> 01:50:07,667
Tomorrow at 11.
Mehboob Studios. Get ready!

1148
01:50:08,375 --> 01:50:09,708
You have a passport?
- Passport?

1149
01:50:09,709 --> 01:50:12,834
"Yes, we'll get Atma-ji
to shoot the love-song in Mauritius"

1150
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:19,708
"Mauritius! It's going to be fun!
- Yes, great fun"

1151
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:26,457
"Quietly, stealthily..."

1152
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:29,709
"the heart is
lost to someone"

1153
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:35,709
Like the Moon...

1154
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:40,709
swaying in the clouds' arms

1155
01:50:42,709 --> 01:50:46,709
High on love...

1156
01:50:48,584 --> 01:50:52,041
time goes crazy

1157
01:50:53,709 --> 01:50:55,957
"Quietly, stealthily..."

1158
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:58,791
the heart is lost to someone

1159
01:50:58,792 --> 01:51:02,958
"Like the Moon
swaying in the clouds' arms"

1160
01:51:03,792 --> 01:51:08,125
"High on love,
time goes crazy"

1161
01:51:11,542 --> 01:51:17,958
"It happens, love happens"

1162
01:51:58,375 --> 01:52:02,958
"To the whims of the heart,
we succumb"

1163
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:07,958
"But the heart
won't heed any reason"

1164
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:12,833
That's how the heart is...

1165
01:52:14,083 --> 01:52:18,333
"once it's lost to someone,
there's little you can do"

1166
01:52:24,667 --> 01:52:26,541
Love is a spell...

1167
01:52:26,542 --> 01:52:32,082
but who casts the spell?

1168
01:52:32,083 --> 01:52:35,875
"It happens, love happens"

1169
01:53:01,542 --> 01:53:05,958
Her promises and vows...

1170
01:53:07,375 --> 01:53:11,541
"why do I trust more
than I trust myself?"

1171
01:53:11,542 --> 01:53:15,875
"This is love,
this is worship"

1172
01:53:17,292 --> 01:53:21,708
"This is what love
revolves around"

1173
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:29,707
Now I realise...

1174
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:35,374
"it's love
the heart beats for"

1175
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:38,417
"It happens...
Iove eventually happens"

1176
01:53:55,334 --> 01:53:56,957
"Tell us something
about your film, sir"

1177
01:53:56,958 --> 01:54:00,916
A mere announcement has
shaken up the whole film industry!

1178
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:05,167
"The shot will be taken there.
- So the day has arrived, Bobby!"

1179
01:54:06,083 --> 01:54:09,416
"It had to!
- You aren't nervous, are you?"

1180
01:54:09,417 --> 01:54:12,916
Me? It must be the rest of the heroes
in the industry who're getting nervous

1181
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,999
Moosa-bhai...
are you comfortable?

1182
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,207
A soft drink?

1183
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:23,041
"If you don't mind,
may I say something?"

1184
01:54:23,042 --> 01:54:26,707
Speak

1185
01:54:26,708 --> 01:54:29,750
"I have a dream project,
a story..."

1186
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:34,749
So?
- So... soft-drink?

1187
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:39,708
"I need your support,
your blessings to make it, brother"

1188
01:54:40,334 --> 01:54:42,832
Why?

1189
01:54:42,833 --> 01:54:44,291
Because... soft-drink?

1190
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:46,041
No? That's all right

1191
01:54:46,042 --> 01:54:49,375
"My movie is based
on your life-story, brother"

1192
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:52,541
What?

1193
01:54:52,542 --> 01:54:56,000
"Yes, the don in my story
sends a shiver down every spine..."

1194
01:54:56,375 --> 01:54:59,041
like I'm trembling right now

1195
01:54:59,042 --> 01:55:01,041
But who'd come to watch me?

1196
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:05,666
"Your story's super-hit!
It has action, emotions, drama!"

1197
01:55:06,042 --> 01:55:09,167
"That it has, in any case.
- Every magazine, every channel..."

1198
01:55:09,542 --> 01:55:12,750
will carry your picture!
- That's what they do anyway

1199
01:55:13,167 --> 01:55:18,750
May I say Moosa-bhai places a
hand of blessing on Atma's head?

1200
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,207
There you are

1201
01:55:21,208 --> 01:55:25,208
You must now have the soft-drink!
- Give it to me

1202
01:55:25,708 --> 01:55:30,834
It isn't very cold.
I'll go and get another

1203
01:55:33,334 --> 01:55:36,207
"Hum Yahan Tum Kahan
- I've been waiting right here, sir"

1204
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:40,916
That's the title of my movie

1205
01:55:40,917 --> 01:55:45,500
The scene is: Sapna and you
are romancing in a park

1206
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:50,000
And there come these two thugs
who misbehave with Sapna

1207
01:55:51,833 --> 01:55:54,874
What are their names?
- Whose names?

1208
01:55:54,875 --> 01:55:57,249
The thugs' names?

1209
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:00,500
Ravi and Suraj.
- What do they do?

1210
01:56:02,125 --> 01:56:05,708
Ravi is unemployed.
- Sir... what do his parents do?

1211
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:09,625
Parents? His father's
a sweeper in the municipality...

1212
01:56:09,833 --> 01:56:12,665
and his mother washes
utensils in people's houses

1213
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:14,416
"The father's tall,
the mother's short..."

1214
01:56:14,417 --> 01:56:17,082
they live in a one-room
tenement in Dharavi

1215
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:19,458
The father comes home
drunk every night...

1216
01:56:19,459 --> 01:56:23,875
and the poor mother
sells snacks after a tiring day

1217
01:56:24,292 --> 01:56:29,083
All she wishes is that her
wastrel of a son would help her!

1218
01:56:29,917 --> 01:56:32,832
What a rotten old story!
Who's the writer?

1219
01:56:32,833 --> 01:56:36,833
To hell with Ravi and Suraj.
What has Bobby got to do with them?

1220
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:44,124
Please come.
The inaugural shot is ready

1221
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:50,583
"So, Bobby, the concept
of the first shot is..."

1222
01:56:53,167 --> 01:56:56,333
Have a soft-drink
before you leave

1223
01:56:56,334 --> 01:56:59,082
"Make a proper film, punk!
Soft drink, my foot!"

1224
01:56:59,083 --> 01:57:02,917
Two thugs will come here now...
- Which two thugs?

1225
01:57:03,292 --> 01:57:06,791
No! No one is coming!
No thug! I won't let anyone here!

1226
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:09,333
You're the hero!
This is how you will stand

1227
01:57:09,334 --> 01:57:12,833
"When I say "action", turn around
and you will face the heroine"

1228
01:57:13,167 --> 01:57:16,333
"The moment she speaks her lines,
spread your arms..."

1229
01:57:16,334 --> 01:57:20,375
"and embrace the heroine.
When I say "cut", let go of her"

1230
01:57:21,958 --> 01:57:25,250
Get a touch-up done.
My heroine has arrived

1231
01:57:30,958 --> 01:57:34,167
I've explained the scene to you.
I've explained it to Bobby too

1232
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,999
You remember your lines?
- Of course

1233
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,208
"Shall we can the inaugural shot?
- By all means, sir"

1234
01:57:40,209 --> 01:57:44,667
Taking!

1235
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,333
By saving my honour
from those goons...

1236
01:57:56,334 --> 01:58:00,209
you have won over my heart.
To flow in the ocean of love...

1237
01:58:01,084 --> 01:58:03,374
to sail in the skies
of dreams...

1238
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:07,209
"to melt in your arms,
I'm absolutely willing!"

1239
01:58:08,958 --> 01:58:12,249
Do not hide your
feelings from me today

1240
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:16,792
Tell me... speak up!
Speak your heart!

1241
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:29,000
Your lines!

1242
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:34,375
Your dialogue!

1243
01:58:35,167 --> 01:58:39,750
Speak!

1244
01:58:40,042 --> 01:58:44,500
Bobby!

1245
01:58:50,250 --> 01:58:55,500
What's their parents name?
What character does the dog play?

1246
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:59,249
Everyone in this country thinks
he can become an actor

1247
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:02,249
Looks like India's future
is returning to the cow-shed!

1248
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:06,625
Why're you guys laughing?
The poor boy at least made an attempt

1249
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,291
He has the courage to do
what he had come here for

1250
01:59:09,292 --> 01:59:13,209
Right. It takes great courage to
forget your lines before the camera

1251
01:59:14,209 --> 01:59:16,415
I know how much of courage
you have too

1252
01:59:16,416 --> 01:59:19,917
What do you mean?
- You can talk big about love...

1253
01:59:20,292 --> 01:59:23,083
"but when it comes to taking me as
your bride, you're a deflated balloon"

1254
01:59:23,084 --> 01:59:26,291
"You're talking about marriage again!
Don't chew on my brains, Rani!"

1255
01:59:26,292 --> 01:59:30,291
Who wants to chew on your brains!

1256
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:33,667
"She's always picking on my brains!
Marriage, marriage, marriage!"

1257
01:59:39,333 --> 01:59:42,874
"May I say something, brother?"

1258
01:59:42,875 --> 01:59:43,707
Speak

1259
01:59:43,708 --> 01:59:48,583
"Brother, Rani isn't a ruffian
or a gangster..."

1260
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,667
that you talk to her so rudely.
With women...

1261
01:59:53,125 --> 01:59:56,332
You ought to talk
with love

1262
01:59:56,333 --> 01:59:58,582
Are you guys going to teach me
how to talk?

1263
01:59:58,583 --> 02:00:01,374
"No, brother...
this is the problem!"

1264
02:00:01,375 --> 02:00:04,249
You whip out a gun
for every little thing!

1265
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:07,291
"On women, you must shower flowers.
Not bullets"

1266
02:00:07,792 --> 02:00:11,208
I can't enact these dramas.
- Why can't you?

1267
02:00:11,209 --> 02:00:15,750
"I mean, why can't you do it?
- We'll give you a demo. Just watch"

1268
02:00:16,167 --> 02:00:19,041
The two of you...?
- Oh yes. Just watch

1269
02:00:19,042 --> 02:00:22,375
"Let's suppose I'm Moosa.
I mean, Moosa-bhai"

1270
02:00:22,708 --> 02:00:26,125
Suppose Lucky's Rani... you.
- This chimp?

1271
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:29,124
Why must I play Rani?
You play the role

1272
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:31,208
Shut up. Do as I say

1273
02:00:31,209 --> 02:00:35,958
Sit down... sit

1274
02:00:37,209 --> 02:00:42,415
"Brother, the cigarette...
one moment"

1275
02:00:42,416 --> 02:00:46,000
Enough of your drama!
You're always taunting me

1276
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:51,042
"Shoot me, if you want to.
But the truth is..."'

1277
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:57,125
"I'm crazy about you.
Henceforth, I will never scold you"

1278
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:00,874
"Forgive me, please"

1279
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:05,167
"Hey Rani, don't say such things.
You mean the life to me"

1280
02:01:06,291 --> 02:01:09,333
"Even if you're taunting me,
it's with so much of love"

1281
02:01:10,375 --> 02:01:15,250
You have every right!

1282
02:01:17,209 --> 02:01:19,415
"Enough, enough"

1283
02:01:19,416 --> 02:01:24,667
"Brother, you get it?"

1284
02:01:25,416 --> 02:01:26,582
"Okay, okay"

1285
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:32,042
"At least give it a try, brother"

1286
02:01:39,416 --> 02:01:45,083
Must I go? Sure?

1287
02:01:46,208 --> 02:01:49,542
I'm sorry... for fighting with you

1288
02:01:51,458 --> 02:01:55,207
I'm the one who should be sorry

1289
02:01:55,208 --> 02:01:58,457
I keep getting angry with you
for no rhyme or reason

1290
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:02,457
Of course you will be angry.
It's because of the way I talk

1291
02:02:02,458 --> 02:02:07,624
But you also sing
love songs for me

1292
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:09,874
You dig my love-songs?

1293
02:02:09,875 --> 02:02:14,083
Of course

1294
02:02:14,084 --> 02:02:16,207
Let's go out of India

1295
02:02:16,208 --> 02:02:19,207
Out of India for a honeymoon?
Wonderful idea!

1296
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:21,207
Honeymoon?
- Oh yes

1297
02:02:21,208 --> 02:02:24,207
One has to have
a honeymoon after marriage

1298
02:02:24,208 --> 02:02:27,290
"There you go again, Rani!"

1299
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:30,666
So what did you mean?
You're acting funny again!

1300
02:02:30,667 --> 02:02:33,541
What funny?
You know I can't get married

1301
02:02:33,542 --> 02:02:35,958
"So you expect me to go
with you, without a marriage?"

1302
02:02:35,959 --> 02:02:37,874
That's not happening!
- At least try

1303
02:02:37,875 --> 02:02:40,249
"No way. Without a marriage,
how will I go?"

1304
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:43,792
"Marriage always!
- Of course, it's necessary!"

1305
02:02:44,208 --> 02:02:47,249
Don't pick on my brains!
- What will you do?

1306
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:51,458
If you drive me out of my mind...
- I can fly off the handle too!

1307
02:02:53,542 --> 02:02:57,499
"Why isn't it possible, Tanya?"

1308
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:02,708
"Life has given me the habit
of keeping awake all night, Jai"

1309
02:03:04,583 --> 02:03:07,457
I have given up dreaming

1310
02:03:07,458 --> 02:03:11,792
"You know it, Tanya. All that
doesn't make any difference to me"

1311
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:15,625
"Maybe not today, but what if it
starts making a difference soon?"

1312
02:03:17,542 --> 02:03:19,541
What will I do?

1313
02:03:19,542 --> 02:03:22,541
Don't you trust me?

1314
02:03:22,542 --> 02:03:26,084
"You're a very nice man, Jai.
You're a gem of a person"

1315
02:03:27,542 --> 02:03:32,374
Go back home.
Listen to your parents...

1316
02:03:32,375 --> 02:03:37,541
and marry a decent girl

1317
02:03:37,542 --> 02:03:41,207
"That you loved me,
were friends with me..."

1318
02:03:41,208 --> 02:03:46,334
is enough for me

1319
02:04:22,375 --> 02:04:25,582
What's up?
Why the long faces?

1320
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:27,749
"And where's the fourth guy?
- We don't know, Moosa-bhai"

1321
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:30,959
Jai said he'd return in an hour.
But it's four hours now

1322
02:04:31,583 --> 02:04:34,916
We can't figure out anything.
- He's no kid

1323
02:04:34,917 --> 02:04:37,582
"He'll come back.
- No, Moosa-bhai"

1324
02:04:37,583 --> 02:04:41,041
I think it's fishy.
- It indeed is fishy

1325
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:46,583
"700,000 in 7 days.
Today's the seventh day"

1326
02:04:49,417 --> 02:04:53,875
C'mon

1327
02:04:58,667 --> 02:05:01,624
Moosa-bhai... here?

1328
02:05:01,625 --> 02:05:06,417
So Aslam-bhai...

1329
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:08,624
you've given up gambling
for kidnapping?

1330
02:05:08,625 --> 02:05:13,541
"Business, Moosa-bhai.
They must repay their debts"

1331
02:05:13,542 --> 02:05:15,666
They must

1332
02:05:15,667 --> 02:05:18,541
Play another round with my boy.
- Why not?

1333
02:05:18,542 --> 02:05:24,125
"Double, or quits.
- Okay"

1334
02:06:23,916 --> 02:06:28,708
"One second, Moosa-bhai"

1335
02:06:48,709 --> 02:06:53,708
"My mistake, Moosa-bhai"

1336
02:06:54,709 --> 02:06:59,167
Deal again

1337
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:14,541
5-6-7

1338
02:07:30,916 --> 02:07:35,666
They're quits

1339
02:08:01,833 --> 02:08:06,792
What are you waiting for?

1340
02:08:36,083 --> 02:08:42,333
"Pull out a gun,
and Moosa will rise"

1341
02:08:42,791 --> 02:08:45,499
Want me to rise?

1342
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:51,500
"Why've you guys stopped?
Get on with it, hero!"

1343
02:09:23,667 --> 02:09:25,874
"When you're hungry,
it's Aslam-bhai!"

1344
02:09:25,875 --> 02:09:27,874
"When you want booze,
it's Aslam-bhai!"

1345
02:09:27,875 --> 02:09:30,291
"Whatever you want,
it's Aslam-bhai!"

1346
02:09:30,292 --> 02:09:35,040
We're the ganglords of Mumbai!

1347
02:09:35,041 --> 02:09:40,375
"He lost his nerve, Ali-bhai!
One shot and his brains spilt out"

1348
02:09:40,791 --> 02:09:44,083
"Moosa, from today,
you are the ganglord of Mumbai"

1349
02:09:45,667 --> 02:09:50,667
Moosa - the don

1350
02:09:50,708 --> 02:09:56,542
"When my 2 and a half kg fist hits,
he doesn't sit. He goes to the heavens!"

1351
02:10:02,833 --> 02:10:06,459
You guys want to become like me?
You want to...?

1352
02:10:07,875 --> 02:10:10,957
"The Armani suit, the Rolex watch,
the Gucci shoes..."

1353
02:10:10,958 --> 02:10:14,124
you want to wear them all?

1354
02:10:14,125 --> 02:10:17,417
It isn't an Armani suit.
It's actually a shroud I go around in

1355
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:22,708
What good are these shoes which
couldn't take me a few feet ahead...

1356
02:10:23,083 --> 02:10:25,957
to give my sister
away in marriage?

1357
02:10:25,958 --> 02:10:28,749
Can this watch return
the moment to me...

1358
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:31,874
when my mother fed me
with her own hands?

1359
02:10:31,875 --> 02:10:34,957
It can't!

1360
02:10:34,958 --> 02:10:37,374
I became a don...

1361
02:10:37,375 --> 02:10:40,916
"but I could never be
a good son, a good brother"

1362
02:10:42,958 --> 02:10:45,707
And you guys want
to become like me?

1363
02:10:45,708 --> 02:10:48,999
You want your posters to be
displayed in every police station?

1364
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,167
You'll forever be on the run!
You understand?

1365
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,749
"And one day, news will be
sent to your house..."

1366
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:58,958
"Lady, your son was killed
in an encounter with the police"

1367
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,749
And I can't make such a call

1368
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:06,833
What will I tell your folks?
That I'm the man... '

1369
02:11:07,208 --> 02:11:10,249
who turned your sons
into criminals?

1370
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:13,874
"No, I'm not making that call"

1371
02:11:13,875 --> 02:11:17,500
There was no one
to tell me to go away

1372
02:11:19,125 --> 02:11:22,665
There wasn't a train at all

1373
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:26,125
But your train is
very much on the platform

1374
02:11:27,708 --> 02:11:30,041
And you guys are leaving.
Okay?

1375
02:11:30,042 --> 02:11:35,291
But Moosa-bhai... we're...

1376
02:11:48,042 --> 02:11:53,166
They want to become Moosa-bhai!

1377
02:12:07,125 --> 02:12:10,791
"Moosa-bhai, I got news on Sultan.
He's at the Sassoon Docks"

1378
02:12:11,167 --> 02:12:14,041
Let's go. We're going with him!
- No

1379
02:12:14,042 --> 02:12:17,124
"Moosa's going there all alone.
- But why alone, brother?"

1380
02:12:17,125 --> 02:12:22,583
They and I now go different paths

1381
02:12:30,625 --> 02:12:32,582
I haven't changed my mind

1382
02:12:32,583 --> 02:12:35,708
But we have changed our decision.
We aren't leaving you and going away

1383
02:12:36,083 --> 02:12:40,375
You can shoot us if you want to.
But we're not going back

1384
02:12:41,083 --> 02:12:43,082
Moosa doesn't need anyone

1385
02:12:43,083 --> 02:12:47,625
"But we need you, brother.
- Listen to us just once, Moosa-bhai."

1386
02:12:48,083 --> 02:12:53,542
"After that, we'll do as you say"

1387
02:12:57,083 --> 02:12:59,916
At what time is your train?

1388
02:12:59,917 --> 02:13:03,832
At four

1389
02:13:03,833 --> 02:13:09,125
You'll be there before that

1390
02:13:33,958 --> 02:13:39,917
No one steps out of the car
until I ask you to

1391
02:14:12,042 --> 02:14:17,458
Open the door! Get out!

1392
02:15:23,167 --> 02:15:26,749
Shoot

1393
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:29,249
I have it written
all over my face...

1394
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:31,374
that I'm a moron!

1395
02:15:31,375 --> 02:15:36,334
"I come to you unarmed,
so that you can shoot me"

1396
02:15:38,583 --> 02:15:42,500
And my men will then
take your four asses...

1397
02:15:42,875 --> 02:15:46,833
to VT station in
an air conditioned car

1398
02:15:50,042 --> 02:15:52,166
I'm a moron!

1399
02:15:52,167 --> 02:15:55,541
Kill them if you want to.
Makes no difference to me

1400
02:15:59,209 --> 02:16:03,541
Hear that guys?
Makes no difference to Moosa!

1401
02:16:05,292 --> 02:16:10,958
Makes no difference to Moosa!

1402
02:16:12,167 --> 02:16:16,208
Fire!

1403
02:16:16,209 --> 02:16:20,750
"Shoot, Moosa!"

1404
02:16:27,583 --> 02:16:30,041
"Know what, Moosa?"

1405
02:16:30,042 --> 02:16:33,292
Isn't a very wise thing to
nurse relationships in our business

1406
02:16:34,333 --> 02:16:37,624
It reduces your lifespan

1407
02:16:37,625 --> 02:16:41,666
Lifespan

1408
02:16:41,667 --> 02:16:45,124
I... I've become a poet!

1409
02:16:45,125 --> 02:16:48,291
Reminds me of a couplet!
Listen

1410
02:16:56,792 --> 02:17:00,083
"Nice folks, die soon"

1411
02:17:00,084 --> 02:17:05,833
It's nice that I'm not nice

1412
02:17:06,375 --> 02:17:09,374
It's nice that I'm not nice!

1413
02:17:09,375 --> 02:17:14,833
Nice glasses!
What make?

1414
02:18:01,458 --> 02:18:07,208
Get the hell out of here!
Hurry!

1415
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:37,292
Give it to him!

1416
02:21:54,667 --> 02:21:58,583
"Brother, think it over again.
Should we really go away?"

1417
02:21:59,375 --> 02:22:02,750
Moosa-bhai! It'll be back to
selling pulses and wheat at home!

1418
02:22:03,125 --> 02:22:08,666
And how about my dream
of becoming Amitabh Bachchan?

1419
02:22:08,667 --> 02:22:12,082
Mumbai is a city of dreams

1420
02:22:12,083 --> 02:22:16,041
But dreams don't always
come true

1421
02:22:16,417 --> 02:22:20,292
So why isn't Jaggi going with us?
I'm going to kill him right here

1422
02:22:20,667 --> 02:22:24,750
You're talking like a kid...
- Get up... sit down!

1423
02:22:25,709 --> 02:22:29,333
It's time for the train to leave.
Now don't make excuses

1424
02:22:29,709 --> 02:22:32,708
"In any case, I'll be able to
discuss something important with him..."

1425
02:22:32,709 --> 02:22:35,875
only if you leave us alone.
- What?

1426
02:22:36,583 --> 02:22:39,708
Marriage. When...? Tell me.
- I've told you so often...

1427
02:22:39,709 --> 02:22:42,791
I don't want to get married!
- How about what I said?

1428
02:22:42,792 --> 02:22:45,708
That doesn't matter to you!
- What?

1429
02:22:45,709 --> 02:22:50,458
"You think you'll come to the bar,
blow up money, fire bullets and leave?"

1430
02:22:51,709 --> 02:22:56,541
"Good bye, sister-in-law"

1431
02:22:59,709 --> 02:23:03,708
What are you doing?

1432
02:23:03,709 --> 02:23:06,541
They've left.
But you won't listen to me

1433
02:23:06,542 --> 02:23:11,750
I've been talking and talking...

1434
02:23:16,292 --> 02:23:19,040
Rani...
- What?

1435
02:23:19,041 --> 02:23:24,500
Will you marry me?
- Marry?
